McLerran,1, \u2021 and Micha l Prasza lowicz3, 1, \u00a7\n1Institute for Nuclear Theory, University of Washington, Box 351550, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA 2Department of Physics, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan\n3Institute of Theoretical Physics, Jagiellonian University, S. Lojasiewicza 11, 30-348 Krako\u0301w, Poland (Dated: November 18, 2022)\nWe discuss an interpretation that a peak in the sound velocity in neutron star matter, as suggested by the observational data, signifies strongly-coupled conformal matter. The normalized trace anomaly is a dimensionless measure of conformality leading to the derivative and the non-derivative contributions to the sound velocity. We find that the peak in the sound velocity is attributed to the derivative contribution from the trace anomaly that steeply approaches the conformal limit. Smooth continuity to the behavior of high-density QCD implies that the matter part of the trace anomaly may be positive definite. We discuss a possible implication of the positivity condition of the trace anomaly on the M -R relation of the neutron stars.\nIntroduction: Massless quantum chromodynamics (QCD) exhibits conformal symmetry, and the expectation value of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, \u3008\u0398\u3009 \u2261 \u3008T\u00b5\u00b5\u3009, vanishes at the classical level [1]. Conformal symmetry, however, is broken at the quantum level. This violation is quantified via the trace anomaly, which has the anomalous term proportional to the gluon condensate owing to the running of the strong coupling constant, \u03b1s.\nAt finite temperature T and baryon chemical potential \u00b5B, the condensate should depend on T and \u00b5B and we can decompose the trace anomaly into the vacuum and the matter parts. The matter part of the trace anomaly can be expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, i.e., the energy density \u03b5 and the pressure P , as \u3008\u0398\u3009T,\u00b5B = \u03b5 \u2212 3P . An interesting question is how \u3008\u0398\u3009T,\u00b5B changes near the transition point. At finite T and \u00b5B/T 1 the lattice-QCD simulations provide the first-principles estimate. In Refs. [3, 4] the normalized trace anomaly, (\u03b5 \u2212 3P )/T 4 (referred to as the interaction measure), in the pure Yang-Mills theory was found to have a sharp peak at the deconfinement temperature, Tc, and a tail approaching zero asymptotically at high T .\nThis enhancement is understood from the thermal modification of the condensate. The gluon condensate melts near the transition point leading to a peak in the thermal part of the trace anomaly. Lattice measurements of the trace anomaly have a striking impact on our understanding of deconfined matter. As pointed out in the section of \u201cDiscussion of Conformal Symmetry\u201d in Ref. [5] the trace anomaly behaves like \u3008\u0398\u3009T \u221d T even for T & 2Tc suggesting that a strongly-coupled gluonic system is realized in the deconfined phase.\nThe trace anomaly has been also calculated in full QCD with dynamical quarks (e.g., Refs. [6\u20138]). The hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory (HTLpt) is successful in reproducing the trace anomaly with quarks al-\nready around T \u223c 2Tc, while the agreement between the lattice and the HTLpt results for the pure Yang-Mills theory begins only around T \u223c 8Tc [9].\nThese high-T studies motivate us to investigate the trace anomaly at high baryon density. For baryon density nB > n0, where n0 \u2248 0.16 fm\u22123 is the saturation density, QCD thermodynamics is elusive because the lattice calculations are hampered by the sign problem. The only ab initio methods are: the chiral effective field theory (\u03c7EFT) around nB \u223c n0 (see, e.g., Ref. [10] for a recent review), and the perturbative QCD (pQCD) at high density where \u03b1s is sufficiently small [11, 12] (see also Refs. [13\u201317] for recent developments).\nTo constrain thermodynamic quantities or the equation of state (EoS), we can also rely on the empirical knowledge from the neutron star (NS) observations; the sound velocity, v2s \u2261 dP/d\u03b5, characterizes the EoS. Recently, a non-monotonicity of v2s as a function of density has been conjectured [18\u201320]. For instance, Quarkyonic description of dense matter [21\u201330] in the large-Nc limit [31, 32] leads to the rapid increase, accompanied by a peak of the sound velocity (see also Refs. [33\u201336]).\nAt asymptotic densities where QCD recovers conformality, v2s \u2192 1/3 is expected; this limit is commonly referred to as the conformal limit, and thus 1/3\u2212 v2s serves a measure of conformality. There was a conjecture claiming 1/3 \u2212 v2s \u2265 0 at all densities [37]; see also Ref. [38]. However, the recent analyses of NS data including the two-solar-mass pulsars [39\u201342] are in strong tension with 1/3\u2212 v2s \u2265 0 at sufficiently high nB [43\u201347], which seems to challenge the conformality in dense NS matter in deep cores.\nHere we propose the trace anomaly scaled by the energy density as a new measure of conformality. The sound velocity is expressed solely in terms of the normalized trace anomaly, and the latter is a more com-\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n06 75\n3v 2\n[ nu\ncl -t\nh] 1\n6 N\nov 2\n02 2\n2 prehensive quantity than v2s . Here, we extract the trace anomaly from the EoSs inferred from the NS data [45, 48\u2013 50]. We discuss the conformal limits \u3008\u0398\u3009T,\u00b5B \u2192 0 and v2s \u2192 1/3, and clarify the difference. We show that the enhancement in the sound velocity is not in contradiction with conformality. We then discuss the possibility that the trace anomaly is positive definite at all densities. We give a number of arguments for the positivity of the trace anomaly and discuss implications for NS physics.\nTrace anomaly at finite baryon density: Scale transformations lead to the dilatation current j\u03bdD = x\u00b5T \u00b5\u03bd for which \u2202\u03bdj \u03bd D = T \u00b5 \u00b5 = \u0398 [51]. For conformal theories \u0398 = 0 but in QCD both quark masses and the trace anomaly explicitly break the scale invariance as [52, 53]\n\u0398 = \u03b2\n2g F a\u00b5\u03bdF \u00b5\u03bd a + (1 + \u03b3m) \u2211 f mf q\u0304fqf , (1)\nwhere \u03b2/2g = \u2212(11\u2212 2Nf/3)\u03b1s/8\u03c0+O(\u03b12s) is the QCD beta function and \u03b3m = 2\u03b1s/\u03c0+O(\u03b12s) is the anomalous dimension of the quark mass.\nAt finite T and/or \u00b5B, the expectation value involves a matter contribution as \u3008\u0398\u3009 = \u3008\u0398\u3009T,\u00b5B + \u3008\u0398\u30090 where \u3008\u0398\u30090 represents the vacuum expectation value at T = \u00b5B = 0. In this work we will focus on the matter contribution only given by\n\u3008\u0398\u3009T,\u00b5B = \u03b5\u2212 3P . (2)\nIt is customary to call \u3008\u0398\u3009T,\u00b5B the trace anomaly too. If thermal degrees of freedom are dominated by massless particles as is the case in the high-T limit, the StefanBoltzmann law is saturated and P \u223c T 4 at high temperature or P \u223c \u00b54B at high density, so that \u03b5 = 3P . Conversely, using thermodynamic relations, one can show that \u3008\u0398\u3009T,\u00b5B = 0 implies P \u221d T 4 or P \u221d \u00b54B, respectively. Thus, \u3008\u0398\u3009T,\u00b5B is a probe for the thermodynamic content of matter.\nThe physical meaning of the trace anomaly is transparent from the following relations:\n\u3008\u0398\u3009T,\u00b5B=0 T 4 = T d\u03bdT dT , \u3008\u0398\u3009T=0,\u00b5B \u00b54B = \u00b5B d\u03bd\u00b5 d\u00b5B , (3)\nwhere we quantify the effective degrees freedom by \u03bdT \u2261 P/T 4 and \u03bd\u00b5 \u2261 P/\u00b54B for hot matter at \u00b5B = 0 and dense matter at T = 0, respectively. These imply that the trace anomaly is proportional to the increasing rate of the thermal degrees of freedom as the temperature/density grows up.\nHere, we propose to use\n\u2206 \u2261 \u3008\u0398\u3009T,\u00b5B 3\u03b5 = 1 3 \u2212 P \u03b5 .

[48], the green dotted lines from Ref. [49], and the red dot-dashed lines from Ref. [50]. We show two ab initio calculations (\u03c7EFT [46] and pQCD [12]) and the red line marked as (a) and the blue dotted line marked as (b) are interpolations with 1\u03c3 band by the Gaussian process applied to different regions of NS data.\nP \u2264 \u03b5, respectively. Therefore \u22122/3 \u2264 \u2206 < 1/3, and \u2206\u2192 0 in the scale-invariant limit.\nWe decompose the sound velocity as\nv2s = dP\nd\u03b5 = v2s, deriv + v 2 s, non-deriv , (5)\nwhere the derivative and the non-derivative terms are\nv2s, deriv \u2261 \u2212 d\u2206\nd\u03b7 , v2s, non-deriv \u2261\n1 3 \u2212\u2206 . (6)\nHere, \u03b7 \u2261 ln(\u03b5/\u03b50) and \u03b50 is the energy density at nuclear saturation density, i.e., \u03b50 = 150 MeV/fm\n3. From these expressions it is evident that the restoration of conformality renders \u2206 \u2192 0 and d\u2206/d\u03b7 \u2192 0, so that v2s ' v2s, non-deriv \u2192 1/3 in the conformal limit at asymptotically high density.\nTrace anomaly from the NS observations: In Fig. 1, we show \u2206 extracted from various P (\u03b5) constrained by NS observables [45, 48\u201350]. The error band represents the 1\u03c3 credible interval corresponding to the error in P (\u03b5). Since \u03b5 is treated as an explanatory variable, the relative error in \u2206(\u03b5) is assumed to be the same as that in P (\u03b5).\nFor all these data \u2206 \u223c 0 within the error at relatively low energy density. Note that the red dash-dotted curve in Fig. 1 follows from the analysis including pQCD as an input [50], which makes the tendency \u2206 \u223c 0 more apparent.\nFig. 1 shows that the (normalized) trace anomaly in the present experimental range monotonically decreases with increasing \u03b5. At asymptotically high density \u2206\u2192 0 should be eventually reached.

Here, we elucidate that this quick approach to conformality causes a prominent peak in v2s . We emphasize that, even if the behavior toward \u2206 \u2192 0 is monotonic in \u03b5, v2s > 1/3 can be induced.\nThe minimal parametrization of monotonically decreasing \u2206 is\n\u2206 = 1 3 \u2212 1 3 \u00b7 1 e\u2212\u03ba(\u03b7\u2212\u03b7c) + 1\n( 1\u2212 A\nB + \u03b72\n) . (7)\nThe crossover density to conformal matter is characterized by \u03b7c and the width of the crossover region is 1/\u03ba. Equation (7) has the correct limit \u2206 \u2192 1/3 for \u03b7 \u03b7c and \u2206 \u223c (A/3)/(B + \u03b72) \u2192 0 for \u03b7 \u03b7c. Nonzero A and B represent the pQCD logarithmic tails that are not well constrained from the NS data. One parameter set that fits the observational data reads,\n\u03ba = 3.45, \u03b7c = 1.2 A = 2, B = 20 . (8)\nThe fit together with data is shown in the inset plot in Fig. 2. We show v2s computed from Eq. (5) with the help of Eq. (7) in Fig. 2. In the high density region for \u03b7 & 2, v2s is dominated by v 2 s, non-deriv approaching the conformal value, 1/3. At low density for \u03b7 . 1, v2s goes to zero. The most interesting is the behavior of v2s around 1 . \u03b7 . 2. This density region corresponds to the energy scale of the transitional change from non-relativistic to relativistic degrees of freedom. There, v2s develops a peak whose height can become larger than the conformal value.\nThe dashed and the dash-dotted lines in Fig. 2 show v2s,deriv and v 2 s,non-deriv, respectively. Because \u2206 of Eq.(7) is a monotonic function, v2s,non-deriv smoothly increases with increasing \u03b7. Thus, v2s,deriv exhibits the peak structure. From this decomposition we clearly recognize that\nthe peak in v2s is not caused by the violation of the conformal bound, but it is a signature of the steep approach to the conformal limit!\nWe stress that this is quite different from high-T QCD where the normalized trace anomaly itself has a peak around Tc, which causes a minimum in the sound velocity. Along the T axis conformality is restored only at temperatures far above Tc. One might have an impression that conformality in QCD should be associated with the weak coupling, but it is not necessarily the case. What we find from Fig. 1 is that conformality quantified by \u2206 is quickly restored around 1 . \u03b7 . 2 and the peak in v2s should be interpreted as a signature of conformality. The peak position may well be identified as the point of the slope change as observed in Ref. [55]. Around this peak \u03b1s is not yet small and the state of matter for \u03b7 & 2 should be regarded as \u201cstrongly-coupled conformal matter\u201d.\nWe note that v2s \u2192 1/3 generally occurs at lower density than \u2206\u2192 0. We can illustrate this in a simple model with the vector interaction between the currents whose energy density is given by\n\u03b5(n) = mNnB + C\n\u039b2 n2B , (9)\nwhere mN = Nc\u039bQCD is the baryon mass, and C and \u039b are the typical interaction strength and the scale of the system, respectively. This can be thought of as the generalization of the mean-field quantum hadrodynamics [56]. Note that \u00b5B = mN + 2(C/\u039b\n2)nB, and P = (C/\u039b2)n2B. This means that \u0398 = mNnB \u2212 2(C/\u039b2)n2B and v2s = 2(C/\u039b 2)nB/[mN + 2(C/\u039b 2)nB]. The conformal point \u2206 \u2192 0 is reached when nB \u223c Nc\u039b3QCD/(2C). The condition of v2s \u2192 1/3 is reached earlier at nB \u223c Nc\u039b 3 QCD/(4C). So in this model the density at which v 2 s surpasses the conformal limit is always lower than that for the trace anomaly.\nStrongly-coupled conformal matter: In Fig. 1 we overlay the currently available ab initio calculations of \u03c7EFT [46] and pQCD [12] on the observational data that, however, do not constrain \u2206 beyond \u03b5/\u03b50 \u223c 101. We utilized the Gaussian process for the interpolation using NS data from the machine learning [45] up to the density \u03b5/\u03b50 . 4 (a) and using all data up to \u03b5/\u03b50 \u223c 8 (b). Details about the choice of the kernel and the noise will be reported elsewhere.\nIn the conservative inference in (a) \u2206 stays positive or slightly negative after quickly approaching zero, which implies a possible bound, \u2206 \u2265 0. Once the conformal limit of the trace anomaly is saturated, the underlying theory becomes approximately scale invariant and the EoS drastically simplifies. Baryons are strongly interacting, and yet the resultant EoS of strongly-coupled conformal matter is P \u2248 \u03b5/3.\nIf the mean value from the machine learning inference is extrapolated, the Gaussian process prefers (b).\n4 In this case \u2206 has a non-monotonic structure with two nodes. Accordingly, there should be a density window with d\u2206/d\u03b5 > 0 (i.e., v2s,(deriv) < 0) between the two zeros. The peak in v2s is hardly affected, however, the maximum of v2s is pulled up as compared to (a). If v 2 s,(deriv) happens to be negative large, v2s approaches zero after the peak, which causes softening of the EoS similarly to the first-order phase transition. Intuitively, the peak in v2s is generated by EoS stiffening, but the soft pQCD EoS at high density requires EoS softening at intermediate density.\nIs the trace anomaly positive in finite-density QCD?: Let us focus on the scenario (a) and consider its implications. The smooth curve of (a) in Fig. 1 supports a hypothetical relation, \u3008\u0398\u3009\u00b5B \u2265 0 (equivalently, P \u2264 \u03b5/3). The positivity condition of the QCD trace anomaly has been often assumed in the literature of finite-T QCD; see, e.g., Ref. [57]. The lattice-QCD calculations at finite T give thermodynamic quantities satisfying \u3008\u0398\u3009T \u2265 0 [6\u20138].\nIn general, however, the trace anomaly may not be positive definite. For example if the low-energy theory is a gauge theory governed by a free infrared (IR) fixed point such as an Abelian gauge theory with massless fermions or a non-Abelian gauge theory with many massless flavors [58], where the \u03b2 function is positive at weak coupling and \u3008F 2\u3009 is known to be negative, then the trace anomaly (1) becomes negative. We also point out that some phenomenological nuclear EoSs bear a negative trace anomaly due to sudden stiffening of the EoS with P > \u03b5/3 [56, 59, 60]. Moreover, QCD at finite isospin chemical potential [61] and two-color QCD at finite \u00b5B [62, 63] produce a negative trace anomaly.\nNevertheless, in view of the observational data in Fig. 1, QCD may well enjoy a special property that the matter part of the trace anomaly is positive definite. One supportive argument is based on the behavior of the chromoelectric field, E, and the chromomagnetic field, B. In the chiral limit only the gluon condensate, \u3008F 2\u3009\u00b5B = \u3008B\n2\u2212E2\u3009\u00b5B , contributes to the trace anomaly. Nuclear matter at low density is approximated as a gas of nucleons, and the trace anomaly is positive for each nucleon (that is the nucleon mass squared), and so the trace anomaly in dilute nuclear matter should be positive. In the nonrelativistic quark model at higher density, the interquark interaction is dominantly mediated by the chromoelectric field, and so the trace anomaly is positive. Besides, we know for sure that the direct pQCD computation at asymptotic high density gives a positive trace anomaly.\nFrom another perspective the positivity of the trace anomaly can be motivated as follows. Eq. (3) relates the matter part of the trace anomaly to the density derivative of effective degrees of freedom \u03bd\u00b5. As long as more effective degrees of freedom are liberated at higher \u00b5B, we can conclude \u3008\u0398\u3009\u00b5B \u2265 0 because of d\u03bd\u00b5/d\u00b5B \u2265 0.

It is a nontrivial and profound question due to the composite operator renormalization. Here, we propose a complementary strategy to test this conjectured inequality using astronomical observations of NSs, namely, the maximum mass bound.\nOne-to-one correspondence is established between the EoS and M(R) (where M is the NS mass as a function of the NS radius R). In order to find the maximum mass, Mmax(R), for a given radius R. we assume a standard crust EoS up to nB \u2264 0.5n0 [64, 65]. Then, for nB > 0.5n0 we identify Mmax(R) by taking the maximally stiff/soft EoS parametrizations. Technical details are outlined in Refs. [66, 67] (see also Ref. [46]).\nSome maximally stiff EoS may render negative \u2206. In Fig. 3 the dotted line represents the original Mmax(R), while the black solid line shows Mmax(R) for the EoS with the \u2206 \u2265 0 condition taken into account. Performing the EoS scan we find the gray shaded region that is incompatible with the \u2206 \u2265 0 condition. For completeness we overlay three current radius measurements obtained with two different methods; namely, spectral measurement of 4U 1820-30 and SAX J1748.9-2021 [72], as well as the timing measurement of J0740+6620 from NICER [73, 74]. We also plot the M -R relations from empirical nuclear EoSs [60, 68\u201371]. From Fig. 3 we can say that the \u2206 \u2265 0 condition has a phenomenological impact to tighten the allowed M -R region. In Fig. 3 we\n5 put a thin line at M/M = 2 for eye guide. If the maximum mass is larger as reported in Refs. [42, 75], our proposed bound would exclude EoSs that lead to sufficiently heavy mass but small R inside the gray shaded region. We propose further systematic comparisons of results with/without our positivity condition as well as the hypothesised conformality bound on the sound velocity for other observables such as the tidal deformability along the lines of, e.g., Refs. [76, 77]. Future multimessenger observations, which are expected to pin down the maximum mass of NSs [78\u201381], and radius measurements together with the tidal deformability inferred from the merger will help to test our conjecture of the positive trace anomaly.\nWe thank Neill Warrington for discussions.
