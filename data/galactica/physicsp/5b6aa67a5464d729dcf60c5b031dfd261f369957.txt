[1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives have been reported to possess important biological activities and may serve as attractive pharmacophores in the drug discovery process. [1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives (1a-1l) were evaluated for inhibitory potential for isozymes of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). CAs have been reported to carry out reversible hydration of CO2 into HCO3 , secretion of electrolytes, acid–base regulation, bone resorption, calcification, and biosynthetic reactions. Whereas ALPs hydrolyze monophosphate esters with the release of inorganic phosphate and play an important role in bone mineralization. Both enzymes have been found to be over-expressed and raised functional activities in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The discovery of dual inhibitors of these enzymes may provide a synergistic effect to cure bone disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Among the test compounds, the most potent inhibitors for CA-II, CA-IX, and CA-XII were 1e, 1g, and 1a with IC50 values of 0.44 ± 0.19, 0.11 ± 0.03 and 0.32 ± 0.07 μM, respectively. [1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives (1a–1l) were approximately 4 folds more potent than standard CA inhibitor acetazolamide. While in the case of ALPs, the most potent compounds for b-TNAP and c-IAP were 1b and 1e with IC50 values of 0.122 ± 0.06 and 0.107 ± 0.02 μM, respectively. Thus, synthesized derivatives proved to be 100 to 800 times more potent as compared to standard inhibitors of b-TNAP and c-IAP (Levamisole and L-phenyl alanine, respectively). In addition, selectivity and dual inhibition of [1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives confer precedence over known inhibitors. Molecular docking and molecular simulation studies were also conducted in the present studies to define the type of interactions between potential inhibitors and enzyme active sites. conclusion In the summary, [1,8]-Naphthyridine derivatives (1a-1l) were found to be potent inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase as well as alkaline phosphatase isozymes. Among the test compounds, the most potent inhibitors for CA-II, CA-IX, and CA-XII were 1e, 1g, and 1a with IC50values of 0.44 ± 0.19, 0.11 ± 0.03 and 0.32 ± 0.07 µM, respectively. While in the case of ALPs, the most potent compounds for b-TNAP and c-IAP were 1b and 1e with IC50 values of 0.122 ± 0.06 and 0.107 ± 0.02 µM, respectively. In silico studies, including Density Function Theory, Molecular docking, and MD simulations, confirmed strong binding interactions exist between active sites of enzymes and potential inhibitors. These dual inhibitors of both the enzymes may prove to be very efficient in the treatment of various bone disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis.
