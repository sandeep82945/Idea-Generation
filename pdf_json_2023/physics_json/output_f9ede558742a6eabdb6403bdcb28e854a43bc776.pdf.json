    "abstractText": "Herein, we report the biocompatible amine-functionalized gadolinium oxide nanoparticles (Gd2O3 NPs) for the possibility of electrochemical detection of Vibrio cholerae (Vc) cells. The microwave irradiation process is applied to synthesize Gd2O3 NPs. The amine (NH2) functionalization is carried out via overnight stirring with 3(Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) at 55 \u25e6C. The size of NPs amine functionalized APETS@Gd2O3 NPs are determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). APETS@Gd2O3 NPs are further electrophoretically deposited onto indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate to obtain working electrode surface. The monoclonal antibodies (anti-CT) specific to cholera toxin associated to Vc cells are covalently immobilized onto the above electrodes using EDC-NHS chemistry and further BSA is added to obtain the BSA/anti-CT/APETS@Gd2O3/ITO immunoelectrode. Further, this immunoelectrode shows the response for cells in CFU range from 3.125 \u00d7 106 to 30 \u00d7 106 and is very selective with sensitivity and LOD 5.07 mA CFUs mL cm\u22122 and 0.9375 \u00d7 106 CFU respectively. To establish a future potential for APTES@Gd2O3 NPs in field of biomedical applications and cytosensing, the effect of APTES@Gd2O3 NPs on mammalian cells is also observed using in vitro cytotoxicity assay and cell cycle analysis.",

            "text": "In recent years, metal oxide nanoparticles, also known as MONPs, have attracted a great deal of attention due to the possibility that they could be used in biomedical applications [1\u20133]. They are appropriate for use in diagnostics as well as therapy because of their compact size, vast surface area, and ability to target particular cells [4]. Research has been conducted on the potential use of MONPs in imaging, medication delivery, and photothermal therapy [5,6]. They are also capable of performing the role of contrast agents for imaging modalities such as computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to this, it has been demonstrated that MONPs possess antibacterial and anti-inflammatory characteristics [7,8], which positions them as a potentially useful instrument in the battle against infectious diseases and chronic ailments. Because of their one-of-a-kind features, MONPs have emerged as a potentially fruitful area of research for the development of future biomedical applications [9\u201312]. In spite of this, the use of MONPs in biological applications is not without its drawbacks, the most notable of which is the potential toxicity of the particles and their instability [13]. Prior to their extensive application in clinical settings, it is essential to perform in-depth analyses of both their safety and their stability [14]. In essence, the utilization of MONPs in biomedical applications possesses a great amount of untapped potential and is a topic of current study and development, with the intention of providing a biocompatible and stable MONP-based platform for enhancing clinical outcomes and overall quality of life for patients [15].\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 995. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14050995 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 995 2 of 13\nIn the field of nanotoxicology, one of the most important areas of research is the investigation of the cytotoxicity of MONPs [16]. Nanoparticles composed of metal oxides have distinctive features that make them appealing for use in a variety of applications in fields such as the biotech industry, medicine, and energy technology. Yet, due to their diminutive size and high surface area-to-volume ratio, they are capable of engaging in interactions with biological systems, including cells, that have the potential to be damaging [17]. Studies of the cytotoxicity of MONPs have shown the impact of these particles on the viability and function of cells. These studies can assist in the identification of potential dangers and provide information regarding the safe utilization of these materials [18]. In order to utilize MONPs, researchers often conduct in vitro tests employing cell culture models to conduct these safety-related investigations. During these experiments, researchers detected changes in cell viability, membrane integrity, and cellular processes [19]. The findings of these investigations have the potential to offer significant insights into the possible effects that MONPs may have on human health and to direct the development of nanomaterials that are less hazardous [20]. Nanoparticles composed of gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) have recently attracted a great deal of attention in the field of biomedicine due to the exceptional optical and magnetic properties that they possess [21,22]. In MRI, they can act as contrast agents, and they also have the potential to be used for targeted medication administration, the treatment of hyperthermia, and in vitro imaging [23]. The high relaxivity of Gd2O3 NPs, which improves the contrast of MRI images and enables better viewing of tissue, is one of the benefits of using these particles [24]. In addition, the fact that they could be less toxic and have a small size makes them excellent for the delivery of drugs to certain cells or tissues in a targeted manner. In order to fully exploit the potential of Gd2O3 NPs in biomedical applications, additional research will be required [25]. As of now, the toxicity of Gd2O3 NPs when modified with some other functionalizing agent is still a concern and needs to be carefully evaluated before their widespread use in human subjects. There are some studies that have shown the usage of Gd2O3 NPs can cause oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death [23]. Therefore, it is important to optimize synthesis and functionalization methods to minimize their toxicity, so that a method or technique can be developed which can overcome these challenges [26,27]. Despite these challenges, the unique properties of Gd2O3 NPs have the capability to revolutionize the field of medicine, and further studies are needed to fully understand and harness their potential [28]. Due to the one-of-a-kind optical and magnetic features that Gd2O3 NPs possess; they play an essential part in the field of biosensing [29]. Additionally, because of the fact that they emit a significant amount of fluorescence, they are frequently utilized as contrast agents in MRI and as sensitizers in other bioimaging applications [24]. In addition to this, they can be functionalized with a wide variety of different biological molecules, which makes it possible to identify particular biomolecules in real time [26,28]. These applications include the detection of cancer, the monitoring of diseases, and the testing of the safety of food. Some studies suggest that Gd2O3 NPs can be less toxic and biocompatible, which means that they can be implanted into the body for long-term use without the risk of adverse effects [30]. In addition, the magnetic characteristics of Gd2O3 make it possible to control and image biosensing phenomena using magnetic fields [29]. Gd2O3 NPs are valuable for optical imaging and sensing applications due to their high luminescence as well as their high optical stability [22]. In addition, the large surface area of Gd2O3 NPs offers a vast surface for bio-recognition, which results in increased sensitivity. Because of its characteristics, Gd2O3 NPs are considered to be a potential material for use in a variety of applications. Some of these applications could be in vitro and in vivo sensing, disease detection, and medication delivery [26]. The present work focuses on the development of 3(Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane coated gadolinium oxide (APTES@Gd2O3) NP-based immunosensors for the electrochem-\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 995 3 of 13\nical detection of bacterial colonies, viz., Vibrio cholerae (Vc) cells. The APTES@Gd2O3 -based immunosensor is further applied to detect Vc cells in the range of 3.125 \u00d7 106 to 50 \u00d7 106 CFUs. Prior to this, we have already shown the capability of the developed sensor in the detection of cholera toxin (CT). The developed sensor was not only able to target the CT molecules without any interference but was also reproducible in terms of signal generation [29]. In this work, we challenged our sensor system for more complex detection by employing it for the detection of the bacteria itself directly or indirectly. Further, to establish the bio-compatibility of nanocomposites utilized in the sensor, cytotoxicity and cell cycle studies were performed in this work. The aim was to study the possibility of the usage of these NPs for the development of sensors, which can be used for in vivo sensing. In order to establish the applicability of these materials for implantable device development, the biocompatibility of APTES@Gd2O3 NPs was evaluated by observing the effect of APTES@Gd2O3 NPs on mammalian cells, and these are observed using in vitro cytotoxicity assays and cell cycle analysis."

Briefly, microwave irradiation was used to create nanoparticles of gadolinium oxide in a single process. During a typical operation, a solution of 1.2 mM gadolinium nitrate was generated by stirring 50 mL of DI water at a temperature of 60 \u25e6C for 30 min. Several drops of 5M NaOH were added into the solution dropwise while stirring until the pH of the solution became 10, and again it was agitated for 3 h at 60 \u25e6C. After this, the solution was transferred into a container made of borosil glass with a capacity of 100 mL and then placed in a microwave oven of LG 1350 Watt (2450 MHz) for a cycle consisting of 20 s on, 30 s off, and then 10 s on. After completion of the reaction, the vessel was allowed to cool to room temperature. Afterward, the solution was washed with DI water 10 times and then with ethyl alcohol using the centrifuge process 6\u20137 times (300 rpm) or until the pH of the solution became neutral. The liquid was poured out using a pipette and the resultant slurry was dried at 80 \u25e6C for an entire night. For further characterization, this product was put through a mortar and pestle and ground into a fine powder. The product was then annealed at a temperature of 600 \u25e6C for three hours. In the end, the result was reduced to a powdery consistency for more in-depth characterization by being ground in a mortar and pestle.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 995 4 of 13"

This technique was used to deposit the nanoparticles. It has been found that EPD is a costeffective way to make a uniform thin film as compared to other deposition techniques. For this, a colloidal suspension containing 5 mg of APTES@Gd2O3 was created prior to deposition by ultra-sonification of 0.5 mL of acetonitrile and 0.5 mL of ethanol. This was followed by the preparation of the suspension (30 min). EPD makes use of a voltage source that is either continuous or variable and has two electrode systems. The generation of surface-charged APTES@Gd2O3 is accomplished through the mixing of magnesium nitrate [Mg (NO3)2\u00b76H2O] salt with the colloidal solution, which functions as an electrolyte. Electrodes were made of platinum foil and ITO glass that had been pre-hydrolyzed. After placing the electrodes one centimeter apart and immersing them in 3 mL of acetonitrile and the colloidal solution that contained APTES@Gd2O3 nanoparticles, a voltage of 60 volts was applied for a period of ninety seconds. The APTES@Gd2O3/ITO electrode was measured to have a surface area of 0.25 cm2, according to the results. After removing the created electrode from the suspension and washing it with deionized water, the electrode was allowed to dry at room temperature (25 \u25e6C) for the next day [29]."

The TEM sample was prepared using a 2 mg/mL suspension of Gd2O3 NPs in 70% ethanol solution and ultrasonicated in a bath sonicator for 30 min, which was eventually dropwise-deposited over a copper TEM grid. The structure and shape of Gd2O3 NPs can be seen in TEM pictures, which show the generation of quasi-spherically structured and mono-dispersed Gd2O3 NPs, as depicted in Figure 2a. The size of the NPs, on average, was measured to be less than 30 nm. The HRTEM was performed to determine the d spacing in the Gd2O3 NPs. The d fringes were around 0.313 nm, which corresponds directly to the XRD plane (222) (Figure 2b). The size distribution of nanoparticles ranged anywhere from 18 to 28 nm, as shown in the image (Figure 2c). The charge on the bare Gd2O3 NPs was estimated by zeta potential.

The magnitude of the anodic current, which was measured to be 1.67 mA for the APTES@Gd2O3/ITO electrode, was found to be significantly lower than that of the bare ITO electrode (2.45 mA) [29]. This occurred as a result of the deposition of APTES@Gd2O3 materials onto the ITO surface, which slowed the transfer of electrons generated by redox species [Fe (CN)6]-3/-4 at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This was possible due to the fact that Gd2O3 NPs were less conductive in their natural state. However, following the immobilization of anti-CT, a rise in current magnitude was seen (2.15 mA). This was due to the fact that there were anti-CT molecules present on the surface of the electrode, which facilitated the transport of electrons between the electrolytes and the electrode surface. These findings suggested that the freely available amine groups of anti-CT made it easier for electrons to be transferred quickly between the electrode and the electrolyte interfaces. In addition to this, the amine group of APTES was responsible for providing a channel by reducing the tunneling distance between the anti-CT electrode and the APTES@Gd2O3/ITO electrode.

However, th activity of antibodi s was rendered ineffective hen ver there was a shift in the acidity or basicity of the medium because of the interaction of H+ or OH\u2212 ions with the amino acid sequence of antibodies. This took place whenever there was a change in the microenvironment. In order to observe the changes that occurred in the electroche ical properties of the electrodes after antibody immobilization, the study of the electrochemical interface kinetics of the BSA/anti-CT/APTES@Gd2O3/ITO electrode (Figure 3c) was recorded at different scan rates (10\u2013100 mV s\u22121) during the experiment. Both the cathodic peak current, denoted by Ipc, and the anodic peak current, denoted by Ipa, were shown to be linearly proportional to the scan rate. This linear electrochemical trend demonstrated that the electrochemical reaction is a diffusion-controlled mechanism [29].\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 995 9 of 13\nThe following equations provided the values for the intercepts as well as the slopes.\nIpc(BSA\u2212Anti\u2212CT\u2212APTES\u2212Gd2O3\u2212ITO)=[18.91 \u00b5A(smV\u22121)\u00d7scanrate(mVs\u22121)+71.42 \u00b5A],R2=0.998 (1)\nIpa(BSA\u2212Anti\u2212CT\u2212APTES\u2212Gd2O3\u2212ITO)=\u2212[18.91 \u00b5A(smV\u22121)\u00d7scanrate(mVs\u22121)\u221239.37 \u00b5A],R2=0.995 (2)\nUsing the equations (Equations (1) and (2)), we can see that the scan rate for the BSA/anti-CT/APTES@Gd2O3/ITO immunoelectrode is linearly related to the difference between the cathodic and anodic peak potentials (\u2206Ep = Epc \u2212 Epa). Since the data fit well with a linear model, it was assumed that electrons could easily go from the medium to the electrode (Figure 3d) [29]. The cyclic voltametric response of BSA/anti-CT/APTES@Gd2O3/ITO immunoelectrode towards the detection of CT was already recently reported by our group [29]. In the present study, we challenged our sensor system for more complex detection; here, we employed the sensing of bacteria itself. It has been discovered that CT is also present in the Vc cells themselves; therefore, we attempted to detect the bacterium using our sensor system. [31]. The present study focuses on the response of the immunoelectrode towards the electrochemical detection of Vc cells directly or indirectly with help of CT. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded for Vc cells (3.125 \u00d7 106\u201350 \u00d7 106) in PBS carrying [Fe (CN)6]3\u2212/4\u2212 at a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121 at room temperature (Figure 4a). For each concentration of Vc cells, n = 3 identically prepared immunoelectrodes were taken. A constant decrement in the oxidation peak current value was observed while increasing the concentration of Vc cells (Figure 4b).\nMicromachines 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 13\nto the scan rate.

The above-mentioned values of sensitivity and LOD prove that BSA/anti-CT/APTES@Gd2O3/ITO immunoelectrode can also serve as an excellent immunosensor for Vc cells [29]. The selectivity of the BSA/anti-CT/APTES@Gd2O3/ITO immunoelectrode was carried out by performing an interference study in the presence of multiple potential analytes in their physiological range, which has been reported earlier. This proved that BSA/antiCT/APTES@Gd2O3/ITO immunoelectrode is extremely selective towards Vc cells even in the presence of different potential analytes. Therefore, the BSA/anti-CT/APTES@Gd2O3/ITO immunoelectrode shows significant clinical importance as implantable immunosensors for Vc cells detection [29]."

Gd2O3 NPs were synthesized using microwave irradiation and characterized using several characterization techniques. Further, a thin film of APTES@Gd2O3 was developed onto ITO using electrophoretic deposition. Antibody against Vc cell (anti-CT) was immobilized onto the APTES@Gd2O3/ITO followed by BSA to fabricate a BSA/antiCT/APTES@Gd2O3/ITO immunoelectrode.
