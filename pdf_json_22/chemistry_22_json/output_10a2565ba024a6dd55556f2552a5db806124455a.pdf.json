    "abstractText": "Drug resistance is the ability of cancer cells to gain resistance to both conventional and novel chemotherapy agents, and remains a major problem in cancer therapy. Resistance mechanisms are multifactorial and involve more strictly pharmacological factors, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and biological factors such as inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway. Possible therapeutic strategies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have increased in recent years; however, drug resistance remains a problem for most pa-tients. Phytol and heptacosane are the major compounds of Euphorbia intisy essential oil (EO) which were demonstrated to inhibit P-gp in a multidrug resistant in vitro model of AML. This study investigated the mechanism by which phytol and heptacosane improve P-gp-mediated drug transport. Phytol suppresses the P-gp expression via NF-\u03baB inhibition and does not seem to act on the efflux system. Heptacosane acts as a substrate and potent P-gp inhibitor, demonstrating the ability to retain the substrate doxorubicin inside the cell and enhancing its cytotoxic effects. Our results suggest that these compounds act as non-toxic modulators of P-gp through different mechanisms and are able to revert P-gp-mediated drug resistance in tumor cells.",

Moreover, when a cancer cell acquires the resistant phenotype, it also becomes resistant to anticancer chemotherapy drugs that are structurally and functionally different from the drug that generated the resistance. In the last decade, target cancer therapies have been developed in the hope of improving anticancer efficacy. While many of the targeted therapy drugs showed promising early clinical outcomes with improved overall survival, a large number of the patients receiving targeted therapy developed drug resistance. Overexpression of members of the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including P-glycoprotein (MDR1 or ABCB1), the multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP1 or ABCC1) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP1 or ABCG2), are implied in the genesis of multidrug resistance (MDR) in various tumor models [1]. In this context, P-gp, also known as multidrug resistance protein 1, is an efflux pump playing a key role in regulating the intake of anticancer chemotherapy drugs responsible\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 356. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15030356 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 356 2 of 19\nfor multidrug resistance in various types of cancer [2\u20134]. Numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies have investigated the possibility of using P-gp inhibitors for the treatment of cancer with the idea of enhancing chemotherapy efficacy [5\u20137]. More recently, some evidences have demonstrated a P-gp reversing activity by using natural products as flavonoids, curcuminoids, taccalonolides, and terpenes [8,9]. In this context, the development of natural P-gp transporter inhibitors that are more potent and less toxic is underway. These inhibitors are divided into two subclasses. Inhibitors of the first-class transport themselves into cells and then they inhibit the function of transporters as competitive antagonists. Inhibitors of the second-class are not transported into cells but affect transporter function [9]. In general, natural product modulators of multidrug resistance (MDR) are substrates for transporters like P-gp and compete with anticancer agents for binding to the active site of transporters (DBP, drug binding pocket) and reducing drug efflux. Most of these natural compounds have the capability to modulate the outflow, inhibit ATPase activity, and reduce the expression of the gene that encodes for P-gp at the same time. A large number of natural products were re-ported to be P-gp inhibitors by blocking the ATPase activity through nucleotide binding pocket or ATP binding pocket (NBP) which is their major binding site [9,10]. For these reasons, these compounds are considered to be fourth-generation inhibitors and their use is a promising alternative to overcome the numerous side effects and the drug resistance associated with anticancer drugs. Some of these compounds have antitumor activities on different types of tumors, all characterized by scarce responsiveness to chemotherapeutic drugs with an MDR phenotype and inhibition of cell growth and an induction of cell death [10\u201320], due to the inhibition of the nuclear transcription factor NF-\u03baB pathway [21\u201323]. AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults. It is a very heterogeneous malignancy and even if the therapeutic choice is wide (combination of antiblastic and biotech drugs with allogeneic stem cell transplantation for eligible patients), the vast majority of patients develop in very short time multidrug resistance that makes urgent the research of molecules able to overcome this condition [24,25]. In the refractory or resistant forms some target therapies are possible but depend on the genetic mutations found in leukemia cells [26,27]. Unfavorable prognostic factors in AML such as the overexpression of NF-\u03baB and IAPs also in correlation with the phenomenon of MDR have been identified and P-gp is a potential therapeutic target because the most clinical resistant tumors are characterized by its overexpression [28,29]). Poma et al., [30] showed that E. intisy EO acts as modulators of P-gp in an in vitro model of AML multidrug resistant HL-60R. In the present paper we wanted to verify if the activity of E. intisy EO was due to its major compounds, heptacosane and phytol. Heptacosane is a straight-chain alkane with 27 carbon atoms. It may be a component of petroleum products but it is naturally present in several plants and insects and also found in the tissues of ruminants [31]. Phytol is a ditherpene widely distributed in plants. Several biomedical activities have been described [32]. We investigated the effects of phytol and heptacosane, identifying different mechanisms of action through which the molecules act as modulators of P-gp in a model of AML multidrug resistant HL-60R."

Effects of Phytol and Heptacosane on Intracellular Accumulation of Doxorubicin in the HL60R Cell Line\nThe docking data suggest a role of phytol and heptacosane in blocking the efflux function of P-gp. Based on these results, we wanted to investigate whether phytol and heptacosane were able to cause inhibition of the P-gp pump, through the accumulation assay of its substrate doxorubicin. HL-60 and HL-60R cell lines were pretreated for 24 h with phytol (25 \u00b5g/mL), heptacosane (50 \u00b5g/mL) alone or in combinations with both. After this incubation, 1 \u00b5g/mL of doxorubicin was added at 30 min, 1 h and 2 h. Data are presented as percentage of fluorescence intensity in HL-60 and HL-60R cells, measured by flow cytometric analysis (Figures 7 and 8 and Table 3). The results indicate a significant increase in fluorescence in HL-60R cells only after pretreatment with heptacosane, showing an intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin after exposure at different times. Pretreating with the combination of the two compounds caused only a minimal increase in the accumulation of doxorubicin in respect to the value obtained with heptacosane alone, suggesting a competition mechanism between the two compounds. In the HL-60 cell line, pretreatment with phytol, heptacosane or their combination did not cause accumulation of doxorubicin compared to its control, confirming a selective mechanism of heptacosane on P-gp which is overexpressed only in the MDR cell line. These results suggest that in HL-60R cell line heptacosane, acts like an inhibitor of P-gp function, as verapamil that produced similar results on doxorubicin accumulation. On the contrary, phytol does not seem to act on the efflux system modulating only the expression of P-gp through the inhibition of NF-\u03baB.\nFigure 6.

            "text": "Anticancer chemotherapy shows a decrease in efficacy due to the overexpression of efflux pumps on the surface of cancer cells. This is one of the main mechanisms for re-sistance to chemotherapy and which rapidly leads to cancer progression [25]. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have investigated the possibility of using P-gp inhibitors for the treatment of cancer with the idea of enhancing chemotherapy efficacy [7]. Verapamil, a phenylalkylamines that blocks voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels used in the treatment of hypertension and in some forms of arrhythmia, has been considered for a long time as a potent first-generation inhibitor of P-gp, but it showed high toxicity. Second-generation inhibitors of P-gp like Dexverapamil, the R-form of verapamil, have shown reduced cardiotoxicity, but little benefit. The poor clinical efficacy coupled with a low therapeutic window of these P-gp inhibitors has led to the development of more potent and selective small molecules, third-generation inhibitors such as zosuquidar, elaquidar, laniquidar, and tariquidar, which act as ATPase inhibitors with a high affinity to P-gp at nanomolar concentrations. Unfortunately, the co-administration of these third-generation inhibitors, did not improve the activity of anticancer drugs in clinical trials and none of them has been approved for therapy [41,42]. There is a growing interest in exploring the use of natural components of plants as P-gp modulators. Some natural products extracted from plants, have been studied for their modulatory properties on P-gp in the form of alkaloids, flavonoids and phenolics, coumarins, resins, peptides, saponins, terpenoids, and miscellaneous other chemical species [8,43,44]. In vitro evidence has shown that some\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 356 13 of 19\nnatural products, such as curcuminoids, ursolic and oleanolic acid, and essential oils, can counteract the phenomena of drug resistance in tumor models of innate and acquired resistance such as triple negative breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia [44\u201352]. In this context, a recent paper has shown how essential oils are able to bypass multidrug resistance through different mechanisms all converging towards the inhibition of P-gp. In the present paper, we demonstrate the mechanism of action of two compounds, phytol and heptacosane present in the E. intisy EO capable of modulating drug resistance in an MDR model of acute myeloid leukemia. Unfavorable factors in AML, such as the overexpression of NF-\u03baB and IAPs also in correlation with the phenomenon of multidrug resistance, have been identified [47,53,54]. Previous results suggest that E. intisy EO in the HL-60R cells reduces P-gp expression through modulation of NF-\u03baB, caused the inhibition of its efflux function and also acts as a substrate for P-gp transport stimulating its ATPase activity which results in intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin [22]. Preliminarily, we verified that both phytol and heptacosane do not have cytotoxic effect (Table 1). Phytol acts as a strong inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB pathway by mod-ulating its molecular targets involved in the phenomenon of resistance to apoptosis and in multidrug resistance. On the contrary, heptacosane does not interfere with NF-\u03baB pathway but reduces same target genes probably through the modulation of other key factors [43,55] (Figures 1\u20133). The docking study of the possible binding modes of phytol and heptacosane with the P-gp indicated that the two compounds bind the DBP site in a similar way to verapamil. Heptacosane appears to be the one with the most favorable interaction, assuming a conformation that could close the efflux pump, moreover, the partial overlap on the binding site between phytol and heptacosane could explain the competition phenomena subsequently observed (Figure 5). These results shed some light on the nature of the interaction between phytol and heptacosane with P-gp at the molecular level and would merit further mechanistic and kinetic studies. As for the data observed for the three inhibitors on the NBP site, verapamil can once again be considered a major inhibitor of ATPase activity. The calculated binding free energies show overlapping values between phytol and heptacosane, even though slightly lower than verapamil (Figure 6; Table 2). The mechanism of action of verapamil is a competitive inhibition in which substrate and inhibitor compete for the same binding site on the transporter and is based on the saturability of P-gp, for which an effective action requires a high dosage and consequently causes marked toxicity. Doxorubucin accumulation assays (Figures 7 and 8; Table 3) confirmed that heptacosane inhibits efflux function of P-gp causing a significative accumulation of doxorubicin comparable to that caused by verapamil. Phytol does not have significative influence on the accumulation of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin intracellular accumulation in the presence of heptacosane strengthen its cytotoxic effect (Table 4). Docking data indicate a possible interaction of NBP site with phytol and heptacosane. Our results suggested that phytol and heptacosane act as a stimulator of ATP-dependent drug efflux transporter, acting as a substrate for transport by P-gp that stimulate P-gp ATPase activity, and lead to the inhibition of P-gp efflux function in the presence of another substrate such as verapamil (Figure 9). Interestingly, when used in combination there is no additive effect probably because they compete for the same binding site. P-gp inhibitors have proved to be unsatisfactory for the clinical use due to the inhibition of the physiological functionality of P-gp in healthy tissues, resulting in high toxicity which limits the application of these compounds. Our data indicate that phytol and heptacosane could be candidates as non-toxic inhibitors of ATPase activity and P-gp function. Our data indicate that phytol and heptacosane could be candidates as non-toxic inhibitors of ATPase activity and P-gp function. For these reasons, they could be used in combination with different anticancer chemotherapy drugs to improve their effectiveness in patients with MDR.\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 356 14 of 19"
