    "abstractText": "Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a major enzyme from the alpha-glycoprotein family that catalyzes the hydrolysis of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), lowering the concentration of ACh in the nervous system, which could cause aggravation of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). In select pathological conditions, it is beneficial to reduce the activity of this enzyme. The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of BChE inhibition by coffee extracts fractionated into monoand diesters of caffeic acid/caffeine, digested in vitro in the gastrointestinal tract. The bioactive compounds from coffee showed high affinity for BchE, \u221230.23\u2013\u221215.28 kJ/mol, and was the highest for the caffeine fraction from the green Arabica extract. The isolated fractions were highly effective in inhibiting BChE activity at all in vitro digestion phases. It has been shown that the fractionation of coffee extracts could be potentially used to obtain high prophylactic or even therapeutic effectiveness against AD.",

            "text": "Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a multifunctional enzyme from the alpha-glycoprotein family, produced mainly in the liver, both in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes [1]. Recently, Severi, Abbatelli, Perugini, Di Mercurio, Senzacqua, and Giordano [2] confirmed the presence of BChE-secreting cells in a mouse model in the keratinized layers of the squamous epithelium of the esophagus and forestomach, in the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach, in the mucus-secreting cells of duodenal Brunner glands, and in the small and large intestinal mucosa. This sheds new light on the activity of the enzyme and its role in the regulation of physiological processes. BChE occurs at high concentrations in the liver and nervous system, but its presence in the gastrointestinal tract is not without significance [2,3]. The enzyme promotes lipid metabolism [4]; catalyzes the hydrolysis of various substances including xenobiotics, such as aspirin [1,4], in particular the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) [3]; and is involved in the hydrolysis of some hormones secreted in the digestive system, responsible for the regulation of carbohydrate\u2013lipid metabolism. In contrast, a mutation of the BChE gene positively correlates with the occurrence of, among others, colorectal cancer [1]. The most understood function of BChE is supporting the degradation of ACh,\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2366. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15102366 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2366 2 of 23\nwhich, under the influence of hydrolysis, decomposes into acetic acid and choline [4,5]. It occurs when the level of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is insufficient, which leads to the gradual takeover of ACh degradation by BChE [3]. However, in certain pathological conditions, ACh concentrations can be very low, and high BChE activity may further decrease them. Lowering the level of ACh in the nervous system disrupts brain function and contributes to aggravation of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [6]. AD patients are mainly treated with inhibitors acting on BChE and AChE or on the AChE enzyme itself. Therefore, an oversupply of the BChE enzyme at a later stage of AD disease is not effectively blocked [7]. Natural compounds that are nontoxic inhibitors of BChE are still being sought [6], and their positive effects can go far beyond the relief of symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases [8]. In recent years, epidemiological studies have shown that regular coffee consumption has been linked to slower cognitive decline, and in in vivo models, the influence of coffee beverages on appetite and satiety regulation, as well as on brain\u2013gut axis functioning, was demonstrated [9\u201313]. It has been hypothesized that the observed effects are in part linked to the activity of coffee nutraceutics as BChE inhibitors. Their concentration and accessibility may change during digestion depending on many factors. Therefore, this work focuses on the characterization, at the molecular level, of the effect of select bioactive ingredients of coffee extracts on the inhibition of BChE activity after simulated in vitro digestion, which has not yet been completely elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine how in vitro digestion changes the concentration of bioactive substances in fractionated coffee extracts in various sections of the gastrointestinal tract and how the presence of probiotic bacteria could contribute to these changes. The affinity of coffee components for binding to BChE and the stability of enzyme\u2013ligand (coffee nutraceutics) complexes, resulting in enzyme inhibition, were also investigated based on thermodynamic analyses and molecular simulations, depending on the coffee roasting level and the digestion phase. Since earlier studies by Grzelczyk, Szwajgier, Baranowska-W\u00f3jcik, Budryn, Zak\u0142os-Szyda, and Sosnowska [14] showed the described beneficial effects of coffee extracts, we suppose that preparations isolated from coffee extracts may work more intensively and be more useful for the development of functional foods."

Subsequently, 150 mL of Gibson\u2019s solution was added to the sample [15], and the pH was corrected to 6.5 by carefully adding 1 mol/L of a HCl solution.

For the analysis of the interactions of the coffee nutraceutics with BChE (EC 3.1.1.8) and the stability of the formed complexes, concentrations of 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol/L of the enzyme and 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol/L of the fractions from the coffee extracts (calculated as 5-CQA) from a suitable phase of in vitro digestion with or without bacteria were used, and in a separated test, ACh at a concentration of 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol/L was added to the syringe and injected along with the coffee nutraceutics to evaluate the inhibition of its hydrolysis. A total number of 11 injections, each of 2 \u00b5L volume, was performed in one run within 30 min [17]. During the experiments, changes in enthalpy (\u2206H); Gibbs free energy, also described as affinity (\u2206G); entropy (\u2206S); dissociation constant (KD); and the complexation (association) constant (KA) were determined on the basis of the Gibbs equation. The enzyme inhibition constant (Ki) of ACh hydrolysis catalyzed by BChE in the presence of inhibitors was calculated using the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation and the enzyme reaction model. The data were calculated using MicroCal PEAQ-ITC Analysis software MicroCal PEAQ-ITC200. The \u201cone binding site\u201d interaction model was used. To calculate enzyme activity inhibition, the ACh hydrolysis signals in the presence of inhibitors were subtracted from the ACh hydrolysis signals without inhibitors, taking into account the enthalpy recorded during the interaction of the inhibitors with BChE.

Docking of the chlorogenic acids to the prepared enzyme model was performed with the Lead Finder docking program [21] using default parameters. The size of the ligand-docking mesh was set as 30 \u00c5 in each direction from the geometric center for each individual docking simulation. The evaluation function of the Lead Finder program takes into account the Lennard\u2013Jones factor, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, stabilizing hydrophobic interactions, and correction of entropy for the number of binding turns and the ligand internal energy. The representation of each interaction was performed using Poseview software version 1.1.2 [22].

Monochlorogenic acids from the other stages of roasting of Robusta and Arabica contributed to survival determined at the level of 0.7\u20132.1 log10 (cfu/mL). However, after 12 h of digestion of the monochlorogenic acid fractions, the highest survival rate was assigned for LAB in the presence of lightand dark-roasted Robusta (1.0\u20132.2 log10 cfu/mL), while the lowest survival rate was\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2366 7 of 23\nassociated with the presence of dark-roasted Arabica (0.3\u20131.2 log10 cfu/mL). The highest viability during the digestion concerned Bifidobacterium, in the cases of both caffeine and monochlorogenic acid fractions of coffee extracts. The highest survival rate was observed in the presence of dichlorogenic acid fractions, suggesting better prebiotic properties in these compounds (Figure 1C) compared with the caffeine and monochlorogenic acid fractions. It was observed that dichlorogenic acids from both green Robusta and, to a lesser extent, green Arabica showed the best prebiotic effect. After 3 h of digestion for Bifidobacterium, the viability was 3.2 log10 (cfu/mL) in the presence of green Robusta and Arabica, while for Lactococcus + Pediococcus, it was 3.1 and 2.8 log10 (cfu/mL), respectively, and, for Lactobacillus, it was 2.8 and 2.7 log10 (cfu/mL). In the samples taken after 12 h, it can be seen that the survival rate of bacteria was still at a high level compared with the result obtained after 3 h of digestion. Taking into account the roasting level, the weakest antimicrobial properties were found with the fraction of green and light-roasted Robusta, and the strongest properties were found with the dark-roasted Arabica. Mills et al. [23] suggested that 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA) selectively modulates the microbiota in the colon in vivo. This is due to the fact that about one-third of CQA is absorbed in the small intestine only, while two-thirds of this compound enter the large intestine unchanged, where they are metabolized by colonic bacteria. 5-CQA can come from the gradual hydrolysis of dichlorogenic acids, explaining the favorable properties of diesters. The authors suggest a significant positive effect of CQA on the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. In other studies, the administration of 5-CQA positively affected the growth of Bifidobacterium spp., while it did not affect the growth of Lactobacillus [24]. Parkar, Trower, and Stevenson [25] also showed that gut microbes such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium can be involved in the metabolism of CQA to quinic acid and CA, which is further metabolized to 3- hydroxycinnamic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids and then absorbed in the intestine by monocarboxylic transporters. Sales et al. [26] evaluated the effect of coffee species, roasting degree, and caffeine content on the growth of probiotic bacteria in vitro. They have shown that the addition of 0.5\u20131.5 g/100 mL of extracts from roasted Arabica and Robusta or 0.05\u20130.8 mg/mL of caffeine, trigonelline, arabinogalactan, and galactomannan resulted in an increase in the count of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus rhamnosus cells by log10, resulting in an amount of 0.5\u20131.8 cfu/mL in the case of medium-roasted beans, while dark-roasted coffee caused an increase of 0.9\u20131.7 cfu/mL. Interestingly, caffeine limited the growth of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (R0011). It must be noted that our study was conducted at low prebiotic contributions in the fractions, while coffee extracts contain a significant amount of dietary fiber that acts as a prebiotic and can alleviate the antimicrobial properties of coffee phenolic acids or caffeine. A similar effect could possibly be observed in the case of functional foods rich in fiber and supplemented with health-promoting coffee fractions. Therefore, the effect of reducing the number of probiotics using caffeine or chlorogenic acids in the intestine in the presence of prebiotics may ultimately be insignificant [27]."

            "text": "In Vitro Digestion\nQualitative and quantitative analyses of the chlorogenic acids and caffeine in the fractions of coffee extracts available during in vitro digestion were performed. Figure 2A shows the profile of mono- and dichlorogenic acids, as well as caffeine, after in vitro digestion in the stomach. A simulation of the digestion of mono- and dichlorogenic acids and caffeine fractions showed that, during the 1.5 h of digestion, the concentration of CQAs decreased by 20% and that of feruloylquinic acids (FChs) decreased by 5% (both belonging to monochlorogenic acids), compared with their pre-digestion values [16]. The level of dichlorogenic acids decreased by 10%, while the caffeine content decreased by 20%. The results suggest that coffee fractions consumed in this form, compared with whole coffee extracts, are characterized by higher gastric availability, probably due to the\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2366 8 of 23\nlack of a larger amount of dietary fiber that bound to the assigned compounds at low pH in the simulated stomach, as we showed in a previous study [16]. Since chlorogenic acids and caffeine are largely absorbed in the stomach in vivo, this form of administration may ensure faster absorption and physiological effects. After the passage of the coffee fractions from the stomach to the small intestine, the samples were digested for 3 h, and then, their composition was analyzed again. Figure 2B shows the profile of mono- and dichlorogenic acids, as well as caffeine, after in vitro digestion in the duodenum. At this phase, it was found that, after in vitro digestion at alkaline pH, weak hydrolysis of the ester and hydrogen bonds occurred, resulting in the release of additional amounts of chlorogenic acids and caffeine. The content of CQA isomers increased by 5\u20137% and that of FCh isomers increased by 4\u201310%, while that of diCQA increased by 3\u20135%, and this increase was greater when analyzing fractions from more intense roasting. This means that chlorogenic acids are, to a greater extent, trapped in the macromolecular fraction of coffee beans in dark-roasted coffees. For comparison, the concentration of caffeine increased by 5% for all degrees of roasting. After another 3 h, samples were taken again, and Figure 2C shows the profiles of mono- and dichlorogenic acids, and caffeine after in vitro digestion in the large intestine. In the case of monochlorogenic acids of both coffee species, the concentration increased by 7% in the green coffee fractions, by 14% in the light-roasted fractions, and by 10% in the dark-roasted fractions, and that of the FCh isomers increased by 5, 10, and 15%, respectively, compared with digestion in the stomach. The level of dichlorogenic acids increased by 8%, 15%, and 20%, respectively, and that of caffeine increased by 6\u20138%.

Even for dark-roasted coffee beans, there was an increase in their concentration to about 50 g/100 g d.b. The concentrations of free dichlorogenic acids in the fractions from green coffees digested in the presence of probiotics increased by about 14 g/100 g d.b. for Robusta and by 7\u20138 g/100 g d.b. for Arabica, and for diesters present in the fraction from light roasted coffees, they increased by about 8 and 9 g/100 g d.b. for Robusta and Arabica, respectively, while for the dark-roasted coffees, they increased by out 5 I 3 g/100 g d.b. for Robusta and Arabica. Previous work [14], as well as studies by Castaldo et al. [28], clearly showed that, during digestion in the large intestine and colon, especially with simulated activity of the intestinal microflora, CQAs were released in amounts of 10\u201315%, which were previously incorporated into melanoidins during roasting of coffee beans. This may have a topical protective effect and may provide important health benefits when absorbed by entero- and colonocytes, including the prevention of many diseases such as colorectal cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.\n(A)\nFigure 2.

The results are shown in Figure 2D. In all roasted samples of mono- and dichlorogenic acids, an increase in the concentration of the tested compounds was observed, compared not only with the earlier sections of the digestive tract but also with the initial concentrations before digestion [16]. It can therefore be assumed that, at this phase of digestion, the chlorogenic acids become available again in the amounts they were before digestion and the bonds forming adducts with macromolecules formed in the stomach are broken down. In the case of the monochlorogenic acid fraction of light-roasted Robusta, the content of CQA isomers increased from 36.91 to 41.36 g/100 g d.b. and that of Arabica increased from 17.56 to 20.06 g/100 g d.b., while for dark-roasted coffees, the increase was from 5.21 to 26.57 g/100 g d.b. and from 8.91 to 12.88 g/100 g d.b., respectively [16]. The caffeine concentrations increased by 5\u201310% compared with that at the start of digestion. The metabolism of selected strains of probiotic bacteria in the post-digestion section in the \u201csmall intestine\u201d resulted in higher release of mono- and dichlorogenic acids in comparison with in vitro digestion without bacteria. With a longer digestion time in the \u201ccolon\u201d, the release of mono- and dichlorogenic acids progressed. Figure 2E,F show the\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2366 12 of 23\nprofile of mono- and dichlorogenic acids, and caffeine after in vitro digestion in the \u201clarge intestine\u201d and \u201ccolon\u201d with LAB of selected strains. In the case of caffeine, its concentrations were higher by about 12% after 3 h in the \u201clarge intestine\u201d and by 6\u201310% after 9 h in the \u201ccolon\u201d. The highest concentrations of chlorogenic acids in the mono- and dichlorogenic acid fractions were characterized by in vitro digestion of preparations from green Robusta, while the highest increase compared with the concentration before in vitro digestion was characterized by dark-roasted coffees [16]. In the case of monochlorogenic acids isolated from the green Robusta extract, the content of their isomers increased by about 18 g/100 g d.b. and that from Arabica increased by 10 g/100 g d.b., while for light-roasted coffees, it increased by 23 g/100 g d.b. for Robusta and by 10 g/100 g d.b. for Arabica. Even for dark-roasted coffee beans, there was an increase in their concentration to about 50 g/100 g d.b. The concentrations of free dichlorogenic acids in the fractions from green coffees digested in the presence of probiotics increased by about 14 g/100 g d.b. for Robusta and by 7\u20138 g/100 g d.b. for Arabica, and for diesters present in the fraction from light roasted coffees, they increased by about 8 and 9 g/100 g d.b. for Robusta and Arabica, respectively, while for the dark-roasted coffees, they increased by out 5 I 3 g/100 g d.b. for Robusta and Arabica.

The binding constant (KA) showed a large variation depending on the coffee fraction in the range of 1.92\u201358.41 \u00d7 103 L/mol for the fraction of monochlorogenic acids from light-roasted Arabica and dichlorogenic acids from dark-roasted Arabica. The lowest KA were found for the dark-roasted Robusta coffee fractions. In competitive inhibition, an inhibitor binds to the enzyme in a manner that prevents the substrate binding. The inhibition constant Ki of nondigested fractions isolated from coffee extracts indicated that these fractions bound to BChE (EC 3.1.1.8) as competitive inhibitors and had aligned and low Ki values in the range of 0.13\u20130.88 \u00b5mol/L for the fractions of monochlorogenic acids isolated from dark-roasted Arabica and green Robusta (Table 1). All fractions, apart from the caffeine fraction, isolated from the green Robusta extract showed an exothermic character in the interactions with BChE and a negative enthalpy change (\u2206H). The change in entropy (\u2206S) was positive in all cases, except for caffeine isolated from green Robusta, which may indicate high rotation of functional groups and conformational changes in the cyclic groups during docking, resulting from spatial adjustment to the structure of the enzyme. The affinity range (\u2206G) was from \u221230.23 to \u221215.28 kJ/mol for the dichlorogenic acid and caffeine fractions of green Arabica extract, respectively (Table 1). Dichlorogenic acids exhibited high affinity for the enzyme, which is consistent with the docking simulation results, where high affinity (total energetic contribution) of diesters was demonstrated (Figure 4I\u2013K). The affinity for the enzyme increased during digestion and was on average the highest after large intestine digestion, supported by the presence of probiotics (Figure 3A). Our study has shown that, before digestion, the highest inhibition activity was observed for the dichlorogenic acid fraction, while the lowest was observed for the monochlorogenic acid fraction (Table 1). Importantly, all fractions showed an inhibition of\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2366 13 of 23\nmore than 50%, which indicates high activity towards BChE side binding at physiological concentrations.\nValues are expressed as an average value \u00b1 SD; n = 6; different letters a\u2013g in one column correspond to significant differences (p < 0.05).\nAfter digestion, the reaction enthalpy (\u2206H) and \u2206G were reduced compared with the pre-digestion values (Table 1, Figure 3A).

As digestion progressed, the enthalpy of the reaction between the enzyme, and the nutraceutics was at a similar level, amounts from \u221236 to \u221232 kJ/mol, but after digestion in the large intestine, it increased by about 70\u201380%. The affinity of the substrates and the entropy of interactions (\u2206S) showed similar tendency. Interestingly, during digestion, all fractions showed affinity for BChE up to the stage of the large intestine, where the lack of affinity for BChE was exhibited by some fractions, mostly originating from Robusta, but the fractions digested in the presence of probiotics were characterized by high affinity, more beneficial in the case of isolates from Arabica (Figure 3A). Our study showed that the IC50 value of digested coffee extracts was statistically lower for caffeine fractions compared with other fractions isolated from coffee extracts (Figure 3B\u2013D). The fractions of monochlorogenic acids showed higher IC50 after digestion in the stomach and small intestine, amounting to about 3\u20134 \u00b5mol/\u00b5mol of the enzyme (Figure 3B), and was on average lower after digestion in the large intestine in the presence of lactic acid bacterial strains. It was observed that dichlorogenic acids isolated from coffee extracts bound to BChE after digestion in the stomach and small intestine and in the large intestine in the presence of lactic acid bacteria but were digested without bacteria from extracts of light-roasted Arabica and the dark-roasted version of both species of coffee. In Arabica, chlorogenic acids were degraded more rapidly than in Robusta, and the compounds responsible for the interactions of BChE with the diester fraction from light-roasted Arabica may include\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2366 14 of 23\nthe early products of chlorogenic acid degradation, as well as the products of the Maillard reactions [29,30].

            "text": "In previous work, the molecular modeling of interactions of individual coffee nutraceutics with BChE was conducted. Adequate for the purposes of this study, in which the properties of the enzyme activity inhibition by fractions of coffee extracts were analyzed, docking was performed with two mixtures of three isomers of CQAs or diCQAs, where the docking sequence of the isomers was determined and a different docking sequence was used within each of the two families of isomers. This approach was used to investigate whether the isomers are competitive with each other when docking to the enzyme at the catalytic site. The binding of BChE with monochlorogenic acids was taken into account in six different orders\u20143-CQA, 4-CQA, and 5-CQA; 3-CQA, 5-CQA, and 4-CQA; 4-CQA, 3CQA, and 5CQA; 4-CQA, 5-CQA, and 3-CQA; 5-CQA, 3-CQA, and 4-CQA; and 5-CQA, 4-CQA, and 3-CQA\u2014and with dichlorogenic acids in five configurations\u20143,4-DiCQA, 3,5- DiCQA, and 4,5-DiCQA; 3,4-DiCQA, 4,5-DiCQA, and 3,5-DiCQA; 3,5-DiCQA, 3,4-DiCQA, and 4,5-DiCQA; 3,5-DiCQA, 4,5-DiCQA, and 3,4-DiCQA; and 4,5-DiCQA, 3,4-DiCQA, and 3,5-DiCQA. The amino acids found in the catalytic triad of BChE, namely SER198, HIS438, and GLU325, were considered the docking site. Furthermore, the BChE hydrolytic activity depends on their availability in binding with the amino acid residues forming the pocket with ACh, in which the peripheral anionic site occurs, which involves the ASP70 and TYR332 side chains, followed by the choline binding site with TRP82 and the oxonic site containing GLY116, GLY117, and ALA199. The active site forms a complex with the neurotransmitter and forces ACh to rotate. After rotation and binding to the acyl pocket containing LEU286 and VAL288, hydrolysis of ACh to choline and the acyl group is possible via a catalytic triad [33,34]. The results of the docking simulations conducted with the mixture of compounds are presented in Figure 4A\u2013L and Figure 5A\u2013L, showing, for the projection clarity, only the complexes with the compound that exhibited the strongest interactions within a given approach. The graphs of the energetic contribution to the binding energy represent the energies of different kinds of interactions coming from the docking of all three isomers. The docking simulation showed that BChE interacting with monochlorogenic acids in the order of 5-CQA, 4-CQA, and 3-CQA bound with 5-CQA mainly through the hydrogen bonds in Val280, ASN68, ASN289, GLN119, and THR284 (Figures 4A and 5A), while in the case with the order of 5-CQA, 3-CQA, and 4-CQA, the docking of 4-CQA involved GLN71, GLY283, PRO285, and SER72 (Figures 4B and 5B). Considering the docking order of 3-CQA, 5-CQA, and 4-CQA, the interactions with 4-CQA were mainly related to GLY283, ALA277, ASN289, ASN68, GLN119, GLU276, and THR284 (Figures 4E and 5E), and for that with the order of 3-CQA, 4-CQA, and 5-CQA, the complex with two molecules of 5-CQA was formed with ASN289, GLN119, GLU276, SER72, and TYR332 (Figures 4F and 5F). The other two sequences (4-CQA, 3-CQA, and 5-CQA, and 4-CQA, 5-CQA, and 3-CQA; Figure 4C,D) show higher binding energies (Table 2). It was noticed that the mixture of three monochlorogenic acids increased the binding energy by about 1\u20136 kJ/mol compared with previous studies of individual CQAs [17]. This is related to the occurrence of not only the hydrogen bonds but also the hydrophobic interactions associated with SER72 (Figure 4D) and THR284 (Figure 4C). In addition, during docking with a sequence of 4-CQA, 5-CQA, and 3-CQA, \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with SER72 were also observed (Figure 4D). This suggests additional interactions that promote stabilization of the complex and enable binding to the active side at TYR322 (Figure 4C), which is located in the anionic pocket and may prevent ACh from reaching the active site of the enzyme. The sequence of monochlorogenic acids 4-CQA, 3-CQA, and 5-CQA also bound with SER287 in the catalytic triad at the site of the acyl group [35,36]. Hydrogen interactions with GLY283 in the pocket of oxyanion were also involved (Figure 4C) [35,37]. Furthermore, in the case of dichlorogenic acids, the compounds showed a higher affinity for the enzyme than individual diCQAs, at the level of \u221247.04\u2013\u221243.23 kJ/mol, except for 3,5-diCQA, in which the \u2206G was \u221249.39 kJ/mol [17]. However, diesters as a mixture had higher affinity for the enzyme than CQAs (Table 2, Figure 4G\u2013K). The highest\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2366 18 of 23\naffinity was characterized by dichlorogenic acids docking with the order of 4,5-DiCQA, 3,4-DiCQA, and 3,5-DiCQA (Table 2). It can be seen that the complex is characterized by hydrogen bonds with LYS427, GLU443, ASN85, TYR456, and GLU80 (Figure 4K). It can be observed that the relationship is valid for almost all dockings of the mixtures: the first compound docking has the strongest possibility of binding to the enzyme, while subsequent dockings have lower binding energies. When using different docking orders, the same compounds show altered binding energies. This proves the dependence of the binding energy on the surrounding compounds and the competitive nature of the analyzed ligands. It is worth emphasizing that higher binding energies (affinity) were observed for the docking of the mixtures compared with the docking of single chlorogenic acids or even the coffee extracts analyzed in previous work [17]. This indicates that a fraction of several active compounds with high concentrations is a more effective enzyme inhibitor than either a single compound or an extract in which the active compounds remain highly diluted.\nNutrients 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 24\ncatalytic triad of BChE, namely SER198, HIS438, and GLU325, were considered the docking site. Furthermore, the BChE hydrolytic activity depends on their availability in binding with the amino acid residues forming the pocket with ACh, in which the peripheral anionic site occurs, which involves the ASP70 and TYR332 side chains, followed by the choline binding site with TRP82 and the oxonic site containing GLY116, GLY117, and ALA199. The active site forms a complex with the neurotransmitter and forces ACh to rotate. After rotation and binding to the acyl pocket containing LEU286 and VAL288, hydrolysis of ACh to choline and the acyl group is possible via a catalytic triad [33,34]. The results of the docking simulations conducted with the mixture of compounds are presented in Figures 4A\u2013L and 5A\u2013L, showing, for the projection clarity, only the complexes with the compound that exhibited the strongest interactions within a given approach.\nA\nD\nB\nC\nFigure 5.

            "text": "Studies of the interactions of fractionated coffee extracts with BChE showed the formation of stable complexes via the main ingredients of the fractions at the active sites of the enzyme, as well as showed inhibition of the activity of the enzyme for acetylcholine hydrolysis. In vitro digestion of fractions isolated from coffee extracts, containing mainly mono- and dichlorogenic acids or caffeine, accompanied by other coffee compounds, increased the affinity for enzymes of digested preparations after the large intestine phase, in particular in the presence of the selected strains of lactic acid bacteria. This suggests that the fractions isolated from coffee extracts after digestion can effectively inhibit BChE activity. The obtained results indicate the potential health-promoting effects, resulting from enzyme inhibition, of coffee extracts, especially their concentrated fractions in the human body. The highest potential has been shown using isolates of dichlorogenic acids from green Arabica. This method of preparation could be used for the development of functional foods proposed for neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders prophylaxis. In subsequent studies, tests on human cells are planned to confirm the supposition.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization\u2014J.G. and G.B.; methodology\u2014J.G., D.S., G.B. and H.P.-S.; formal analysis\u2014J.G., D.S., B.S., E.B.-W., H.P.-S. and M.C.-B.; writing\u2014original draft preparation\u2014J.G. and G.B. writing\u2014review and editing\u2014D.S. and H.P.-S.; project administration\u2014J.G.; funding acquisition\u2014J.G. and G.B.
