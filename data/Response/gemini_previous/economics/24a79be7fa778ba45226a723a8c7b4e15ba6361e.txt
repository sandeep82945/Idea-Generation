1. **Incorporating dynamic demand and supply:** The current model assumes static demand and supply, which may not be realistic in practice. Future research could extend the model to incorporate dynamic demand and supply, which would allow for more accurate representation of the real-world MaaS system.


2. **Considering different types of subsidies:** The current model only considers a single type of subsidy, which is a per-path subsidy. Future research could explore different types of subsidies, such as per-user subsidies, per-trip subsidies, or subsidies that vary based on the time of day or day of the week.


3. **Analyzing the impact of different pricing schemes:** The current model assumes a link-additive pricing scheme, in which the fare for a trip is the sum of the fares for each link in the trip. Future research could explore different pricing schemes, such as distance-based pricing, time-based pricing, or congestion-based pricing.


4. **Investigating the effects of different market structures:** The current model assumes a single MaaS platform operator. Future research could investigate the effects of different market structures, such as multiple MaaS platform operators or a mix of MaaS platform operators and traditional transit operators.


5. **Developing a decision-support tool:** The current model is a research tool that is not intended for use by practitioners. Future research could develop a decision-support tool that would allow practitioners to use the model to design and evaluate MaaS systems.
