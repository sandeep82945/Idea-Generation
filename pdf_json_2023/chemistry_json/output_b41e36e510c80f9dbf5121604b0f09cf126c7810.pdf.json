    "abstractText": "The study aimed to synthesize non-noxious, clean, reliable, and green sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) from Citrus limon leaves. The synthesized SNPs were used to analyze particle size, zeta potential, UV\u2013visible spectroscopy, SEM, and ATR-FTIR. The prepared SNPs exhibited a globule size of 55.32 \u00b1 2.15 nm, PDI value of 0.365 \u00b1 0.06, and zeta potential of \u221212.32 \u00b1 0.23 mV. The presence of SNPs was confirmed by UV\u2013visible spectroscopy in the range of 290 nm. The SEM image showed that the particles were spherical with a size of 40 nm. The ATR-FTIR study showed no interaction, and all the major peaks were preserved in the formulations. An antimicrobial and antifungal study of SNPs was carried out against Gram-positive bacteria (Staph. aureus, Bacillus), Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and Bordetella), and fungal strains (Candida albicans). The study showed that Citrus limon extract SNPs exhibited better antimicrobial and antifungal activities against Staph. aureus, Bacillus, E. coli, Bordetella, and Candida albicans at a minimal inhibitory concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL. Different antibiotics were used alone and in combination with SNPs of Citrus limon extract to evaluate their activity against various strains of bacteria and fungal strains. The study showed that using SNPs of Citrus limon extract with antibiotics has a synergistic effect against Staph.aureus, Bacillus, E. coli, Bordetella, and Candida albicans. SNPs were embedded in nanohydrogel formulations for in vivo (wound healing) studies. In preclinical studies, SNPs of Citrus limon extract embedded within a nanohydrogel formulation (NHGF4) have shown promising results. To be widely used in clinical settings, further studies are needed to evaluate their safety and efficacy in human volunteers.",

Nanoparticles (NPs) have a wide range of potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry, including drug delivery, formulation, imaging, diagnosis, vaccines, and regenerative medicine [2]. NPs typically range in size from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm) [3].\nGels 2023, 9, 284. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9040284 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2023, 9, 284 2 of 16\nIn comparison to other processes, the green methods of nanoparticle preparation are those that use environmentally friendly and sustainable materials and processes, such as natural extracts, biopolymers, and water-based solvents, to synthesize nanoparticles [4]. These methods are gaining increasing attention in the field of nanotechnology due to their potential to reduce the environmental impact and toxicity associated with traditional nanoparticle synthesis methods, which often use hazardous chemicals and solvents [5]. Sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) have potential applications in various fields, including agriculture and medicine, due to their unique properties, such as high surface area, catalytic activity, and biocompatibility [6]. The green synthesis of SNPs using plant-based materials is an environmentally friendly and sustainable approach that has gained increasing attention in recent years [7]. Citrus limon, commonly known as lemon, is a citrus fruit that contains various bioactive compounds, including sulfur compounds, which can be used for the synthesis of sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) [8]. SNPs derived from Citrus limon have been reported to possess antibacterial activity against various types of bacteria, including Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria [9]. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, which makes them susceptible to disruption by certain antimicrobial agents [10]. SNPs have been shown to have the ability to penetrate the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria and cause damage to the cell membrane, leading to cell death [11], while Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that contains lipopolysaccharides, which can act as a barrier to prevent the entry of many antibacterial agents [12]. However, SNPs of Citrus limon can bind to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and disrupt the membrane integrity, leading to the leakage of cellular contents and, eventually, cell death [13]. They can also penetrate the cell wall and interact with intracellular components, such as DNA and proteins, leading to their inactivation [14]. A study showed that SNPs of Citrus limon have potential antimicrobial properties against fungal infection (Candida albicans) [15]. Candida albicans is a type of yeast that can cause infections in humans, especially in immunocompromised individuals [16]. SNPs of Citrus limon bind to the cell wall and membrane of Candida albicans and cause structural damage, leading to the leakage of cellular contents and, eventually, cell death [17]. They can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can cause oxidative damage to cellular components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to cell death. Moreover, SNPs can also inhibit the activity of enzymes that are essential for the growth and survival of Candida albicans, further contributing to their antifungal activity [18]. Nanohydrogels are a type of nanomaterial that is composed of cross-linked hydrophilic polymers, which can swell in water or other biological fluids [19]. They have unique properties that make them attractive for use in wound healing applications, such as their high water content, biocompatibility, and ability to encapsulate and deliver drugs [20]. The combination of SNPs of Citrus limon and nanohydrogels has been shown to have synergistic effects on wound healing [21]. In a study published in the International Journal of Nanomedicine, researchers developed a nanohydrogel loaded with silver nanoparticles of Citrus limon and evaluated its efficacy in treating infected wounds in rats. The results showed that the combination of these two materials was more effective in promoting wound healing and reducing bacterial growth than using either material alone [22]. The present study aimed to synthesize and characterize SNPs from Citrus limon for enhanced antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staph. aureus and Bacillus) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and Bordetella), as well as antifungal (Candida albicans) activities. The SNPs of Citrus limon were embedded into a nanohydrogel for enhanced wound healing activities.\nGels 2023, 9, 284 3 of 16"

The Gram-positive bacteria (Staph. aureus and Bacillus) were treated with SNPs, erythromycin thiocyanate (ET), and a combination of SNPs with erythromycin thiocyanate (SNPsET). The SNPs showed antimicrobial activity against Staph.aureus and Bacillus due to the presence of Citrus limon extract. The SNPs of Citrus limon extract are attributed to its ability to disrupt the cell membranes of bacteria, leading to bacterial cell death. Erythromycin thiocyanate also showed antimicrobial activity. Erythromycin thiocyanate works by inhibiting the growth and replication of bacteria by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, thereby preventing the formation of peptide bonds during protein synthesis. The combination of SNPs and erythromycin thiocyanate have shown synergistic effects against Staph. aureus and Bacillus. SNPs disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, while erythromycin thiocyanate inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. The combination of SNPs and erythromycin thiocyanate worked together to synergistically enhance the overall antimicrobial effect. The Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and Bordetella) were treated with SNPs, neomycin sulfate (NS), and a combination of SNPs with neomycin sulfate (SNPsNS).

A nanohydrogel loses its structure and propensity when temperature and pH are increased [38]. The formulation (NHGF4) was found to maintain its structural integrity after 60 days (Table 2)."

            "text": "Using sulfur nanoparticles of Citrus limon showed promising results in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus, E. coli, Bordetella, and Candida albicans. Using Citrus limon as a source of sulfur nanoparticles is advantageous, as it is easily accessible and possesses various bioactive compounds with potential therapeutic effects. Furthermore, using sulfur nanoparticles of Citrus limon embedded in a nanohydrogel formulation (NHGF4) showed potential in promoting wound healing activity in rats. NHGF4 exhibited significant wound closure indicating its effectiveness in accelerating the healing process. The nanohydrogel matrix also provided a suitable cell proliferation and tissue regeneration environment. Therefore, the study concluded that the sulfur nanoparticles of Citrus limon embedded in a nanohydrogel formulation could be a promising candidate for wound healing applications. However, further studies are required to investigate the safety and efficacy of the formulation in humans and optimize the dosage and application methods for clinical use."

By scattering 8.5 g of carbopol-934 in 85 mL of distilled water and thoroughly mixing it for 15 min at a speed of 10,000 rpm with a magnetic stirrer, nanohydrogel was formed. After that, 1.5 mL of triethanolamine, a cross-linking agent, was added to the gel. Then, hydrogel was subjected to a 5-min sonication process to eliminate the entrapped air bubbles. The hydrogel was then wrapped in aluminum foil and left in the dark overnight to fully cross-link the polymeric gel with TEA and allow it to swell completely.
