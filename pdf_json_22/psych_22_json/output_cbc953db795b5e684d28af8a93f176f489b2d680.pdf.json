    "abstractText": "As the world grapples with life changed by the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging infections with consequential public health threats continue to be invariably reported in various regions of the world. A clear example is the most recent global monkeypox outbreak which was declared a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on July 23rd, 2022 (World Health Organization 2022). To date, this unprecedented outbreak has resulted in 60,799 laboratory-confirmed cases from over 95 non-endemic countries, and although viral genomic surveillance has observed several monkeypox strains, few deaths have been documented thus far (CDC 2022). Despite the favorable clinical outcomes of this disease, epidemiological data suggest that community-sustained transmission of monkeypox infections has the potential to adversely affect high-risk populations, especially immunocompromised individuals and particularly pregnant women (Vouga et al. 2022). This concern is eminently presented by available clinical evidence surrounding monkeypox in pregnancy which supports the likelihood of increased obstetric complications such as intrauterine fetal demise, increased risk of congenital infections, preterm birth, miscarriage, and ominous maternal reactions (Dashraath et al. 2022). The heightened risk of vertical transmission of this virus coupled with a notable absence of case-specific and national management guidelines is negatively impacting the psychological state of pregnant women worldwide (Medscape 2022). This recent public health emergency calls for a unified action plan toward better understanding the mental health consequences of another future global crisis. Intensified efforts are especially important as maternal mental health research is a valuable yet understudied aspect of public health research.",

A clear example is the most recent global monkeypox outbreak which was declared a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on July 23rd, 2022 (World Health Organization 2022).

Intensified efforts are especially important as maternal mental health research is a valuable yet understudied aspect of public health research.\nPotential implications of\u00a0emerging monkeypox infection on\u00a0pregnant women\u2019s mental health\nRecently, the WHO has issued statements warning about the potential dangers of the monkeypox infection in the pregnant women population, this comes as a response to a substantially increased number of anxiety-driven queries and concerns about this emerging infection. The WHO has explicitly stated that the situation is considered an \u201cemergency\u201d and therefore requires an \u201cintense\u201d response by all public health entities involved. These rapid global developments are undoubtedly distressing for pregnant woman and their unborn child (CBC 2022).

Additionally, social support during the pregnancy period is an essential factor in the smooth recovery of the mother and the newborn child; however, as recounted by the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine and maternal separation after childbirth might be necessary for the infected mother, this burden and fear of similar conditions post-partum is only adding more tension to the monkeypox narrative among pregnant women (Wang et\u00a0al. 2020). The post-partum period also carries its own set of challenges. For instance, post-partum depression risk is increased in the setting of global emergencies as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic (Brooks et\u00a0al. 2020). Furthermore, there remains no fixed consensus on the safety of breastfeeding in the COVID-19 context and this is also the case for the monkeypox virus. This ambiguity in clinical practice and advocacy creates many challenges for clinicians and researchers worldwide, especially when public awareness and health education become necessary in deriving essential public health measures (Khalil et\u00a0al. 2022)."

            "text": "A multimodal approach is warranted to tackle the rising threats of viral outbreaks on this vulnerable population. Ensuring the psychological safety of pregnant women should be prioritized by setting up mental health hotlines for queries or health concerns related to viral spread. In lower-income countries without adequate infrastructure for such services, chatbots can be an efficient method of addressing public health fears in this population (Chung et\u00a0al. 2021). This potentially alleviates the social stress burden among pregnant women while serving as a reliable source for seeking evidence-based information. Moreover, governments and social media entities can invest in online awareness campaigns on clarifying pertinent fears related to vaccination during pregnancy. Government surveillance initiatives on social media platforms can further aid in dispelling myths and misinformation surrounding this topic (Ennab et\u00a0al. 2022b).\nFrom a personalized care aspect, the mental health of pregnant women should be extensively supported by involving professionals as needed. Psychology-trained social workers can be actively involved in communities to ensure timely mental health screening and psychological risk stratification\nof pregnant women. Furthermore, the need for establishing telepsychiatry services may provide ease in access, particularly due to the increased isolation of pregnant women from healthcare settings due to the risk of developing viral infections (Overbeck et\u00a0al. 2020; Al-Sharif et\u00a0al. 2021). With the importance of physical health on mental wellness, the use of digital health apps for education and perinatal health assessment should be offered to provide a continuum of care (Chattu et\u00a0al. 2021). Lastly, there is a strong need for research and funding to understand the perinatal and postnatal psychological implications of increasing viral outbreaks in this population. This imminent challenge requires a global collaborative effort from health organizations for early detection of mental illness and in improving maternal wellbeing."

Emerging infections affecting pregnant women are historically met with adverse psychological complications, such as the ones seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. The link between deteriorating mental health and complications arising during the pregnancy period needs to be carefully assessed.
