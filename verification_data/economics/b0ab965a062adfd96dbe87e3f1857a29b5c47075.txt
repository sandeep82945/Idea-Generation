"WEF nexus-based studies, policies, and projects must be focussed on the direct and indirect achievement of SDGs 1, 2, 6, 7, and 13, both in terms of access and availability, to ensure distributional justice, especially in the African context. Such actions, combined with broad public participation, can have a ripple effect on other SDGs such as SDGs 5, 10, and 17, thereby reducing inequalities and building partnerships to attain these aspirational goals."

"The moderate correlation between the HDI and the WEF Nexus Index implies that food and nutrition security and service delivery in terms of access to freshwater, safe sanitation, and electricity greatly catalyse human development."

"However, in all cases, planning and implementation of interventions seeking security of water, energy and food resources need to be conducted from a nexus perspective to optimise synergies and minimize trade-offs."

"Policies that balance the drought-proofing of rainfed agriculture and irrigation development are needed. This conclusion should inform the CAADP goals regarding the expansion of areas under irrigation in many African nations, as well as the strengthening of the supply chains associated with the entire agricultural sector."

"The need to develop clean, affordable, renewable energy as an enabler for agricultural development should also be incorporated into regional plans such as SADCâ€™s RISDP, RSAP IV, and the Regional WEF Nexus Framework."

"Deeper analysis at subnational levels and scales may (i) reveal spatial variations in dynamics of the WEF nexus at local scales, and (ii) inform potential for improvements in policy and practice within and between countries."
