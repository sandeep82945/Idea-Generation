    "abstractText": "Azo dye-containing wastewater poses serious risks of environmental pollution because it is generally biologically toxic and resistant to conventional wastewater treatment methods. A novel degradation system integrating ozone, microchannel, and ultrasound was designed to effectively degrade azo dye-contaminated wastewater. The effects of discharge voltage of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor, liquid flow rate, microchannel width, ultrasonic power, initial pH, and reaction temperature on methylene blue (MB) decolorization were studied. A maximum MB decolorization efficiency of 92.7% was obtained in the ozone/microchannel/ultrasound (O3/MC/US) system with 14 min of treatment. In addition, the 14-min decolorization efficiency and TOC removal efficiency obtained in O3/MC/US system were increased by 12.6 and 6.5%, respectively, compared to those obtained in the pure O3 system. Based on the results of scavenging experiments, the combined effects of microchannel and ultrasound were proved to improve the contribution rate of hydroxyl radicals, thus improving the decolorization efficiency. The present work clearly illustrates that ozonation degradation can be effectively enhanced by microchannel and ultrasound, and also provides a feasible method for the treatment of organic wastewater.",

            "text": "Azo dyes are characterized by containing at least one azo group (\u2013N\u00bcN\u2013) bound to a chromophore or aromatic system (Sun et al. 2022). Due to the advantages of firm coloring and low production cost, azo dyes bring great convenience to our daily life. However, azo substances are generally toxic and non-biodegradable, and may cause serious water pollution even at low concentrations (Srivastava et al. 2022). Therefore, efficient degradation methods of azo-contaminated effluents are urgently needed to be investigated.\nUnfortunately, conventional physical (Sun et al. 2006), chemical (Wu & Wang 2001) and biological (Prasac & Aikat 2014) treatment techniques are mineralized incomplete, time-consuming and uneconomical (Rayaroth et al. 2021). In recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been widely used for efficient and non-selective degradation of azo dyes (Bilin\u0301ska & Gmurek 2021; Liu et al. 2021; Ismail & Sakai 2022). The principle of AOPs is to utilize the strong reactivity of hydroxyl radicals (HO\u2022) to indiscriminately attack organic molecules, thus mineralizing the target pollutants (Dong et al. 2022). AOPs can be classified either as heterogeneous or homogeneous progress (Poyatos et al. 2010). Heterogeneous AOPs, referring to the processes using catalysts, have the advantages of environmental friendliness, high efficiency, and energy saving (Hou et al. 2022). Nevertheless, the difficulty of catalyst recovery limits the applications of heterogeneous AOPs in large-scale wastewater treatment. Homogeneous AOPs refer to the processes that use Fenton reagents (hydrogen peroxide with ferrous ions) and ozone (O3) as the sources of HO\u2022, with or without energy input. Although the Fenton process is widely used for its simplicity and efficiency, its major drawback is the production of iron sludge waste, which inevitably causes secondary pollution (Poyatos et al. 2010). Compared with other approaches, homogeneous AOPs based on ozonation have been considered a popular way due to their high oxidation potential and no generation of chemical byproducts (Zheng et al. 2022).\n://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/87/3/598/1172616/wst087030598.pdf\nDownloaded fr by guest on 11 January\nO3 is unstable in the aqueous medium and will spontaneously decompose through a complex mechanism involving HO\u2022 generation. Consequently, the ozonation degradation of azo dyes follows two pathways (Mehrjouei et al. 2015), including the direct pathway caused by molecular O3 (E\n0(O3/H2O)\u00bc\u00fe2.07 V), and the indirect pathway caused by HO\u2022 (E0(HO\u2022/ H2O)\u00bc\u00fe2.8 V). In the direct pathway, azo dyes are degraded by O3 through oxidation\u2013reduction reaction, cycloaddition reaction, electrophilic substitution reaction, and nucleophilic reaction (Issaka et al. 2021). In the indirect pathway, since HO\u2022 has a higher oxidation potential than O3, and reacts with organic compounds 10\n6\u20131012 times faster than O3 (Munter 2001), azo dyes can be completely mineralized into carbon dioxide and water. The specific process of mineralization generally includes C\u2013N bond rupturing, desulfurization reaction, and denitrification reaction (Shamsabadi & Behpour 2021). However, the use of ozonation treatment without any enhancement method is limited by low O3 utilization (Miruka et al. 2021; Ghanbari et al. 2020) and poor HO\u2022 yield (Poyatos et al. 2010; Guo et al. 2015), because O3 is difficult to dissolve and decompose spontaneously in aqueous solution (Wu et al. 2020). Therefore, the focus of this study is to investigate the possibility of the ozonation process enhanced by microchannel and ultrasound, as well as the resultant combination effects on MB degradation.\nMicrochannel can be used to improve O3 utilization due to its large surface-to-volume ratio and short transport path. The ozonation degradation of azo dye Acid Red 14 enhanced by microchannel was reported to follow a pseudo-first-order kinetic model (Gao et al. 2012). The decolorization efficiency was observed to increase with the decrease of liquid volume flow rate in the microchannel. Additionally, the combination effect of microchannel on ozonation was investigated by MB degradation experiments with a microchannel reactor (Patinglag et al. 2019). It was found that the degradation efficiency was improved by a decreasing microchannel width in the range of 50\u2013100 \u03bcm.\nAs another enhancement method, ultrasound can be used to improve the HO\u2022 yield and the mixing intensity of solutes. According to the hot-spot theory (Giray et al. 2018), the decomposition of O3 into HO\u2022 will be promoted by the local excessive temperature released during the rupture of cavitation bubbles. The synergistic effect of ultrasound was investigated by combining a 520 kHz ultrasound with an ozonation process to degrade textile dyes (Tezcanli-Guyer & Ince 2004). The improvement of degradation efficiency was attributed to the enhancement of O3 diffusion, electrophilic reaction, and radical reaction by ultrasound. To the best of our knowledge, the combined applications of microchannel and ultrasound in the ozonation process are limited. In this study, we designed a novel degradation system that combines O3, microchannel and ultrasound for the treatment of azo dye wastewater. The effects of the discharge voltage of DBD reactor, liquid flow rate, microchannel width, ultrasonic power, initial pH and reaction temperature on decolorization efficiency were studied. The combination effects of microchannel and ultrasound on ozonation degradation were clearly evaluated. The contribution of HO\u2022 to decolorization was also investigated by scavenging experiments. We, therefore, anticipated that this work would provide some theoretical and technical references for the treatment of azo dyes-containing effluents."

            "text": "The discharge voltage of the DBD reactor affects the concentration of generated O3. The O3 generation can be improved by the increase of discharge voltage, while an excessive discharge voltage will cause a temperature rise, which may induce the decomposition of O3 into oxygen. Therefore, it is significant to study the effect of discharge voltage on MB degradation. The initial pH was adjusted to 7, and the reaction temperature was controlled at 23 \u00b0C. According to Paschen\u2019s law (Eichhorn et al. 1993; Samaranayake et al. 2000), only when the discharge voltage is higher than 7.2 kV, the air between two electrodes will be broken down and converted into O3. In the present work, the discharge voltage was adjusted by changing the regulating voltage. When the regulating voltages of 50, 60, and 70 V were applied, the corresponding discharge voltages measured by the oscilloscope were 7.8, 8.6, and 9.5 kV, respectively. As shown in Figure 3, the MB decolorization efficiency increased with the increasing discharge voltage of the DBD reactor. When the discharge voltages were 7.8, 8.6, and 9.5 kV, the 14-min decolorization efficiency reached 71.0, 77.3, and 79.3%, respectively. The decolorization process was observed to follow first-order kinetics within 10 min, and the rate constants were 0.063, 0.065, and 0.081 s 1 at discharge voltages of 67.8, 8.6, and 9.5 kV, respectively. The increase in discharge voltage can reduce the population density of low-energy electrons, which decompose the generated O3, thereby improving the O3 yield (Kitayama & Kuzumoto 1997). Statistical results have shown that the decolorization efficiency obtained at discharge voltages of 7.8 and 8.6 kV was statistically different within 14 min. When the discharge voltage was 9.5 kV, the decolorization efficiency obtained within 10 min was statistically different. However, under the continuous treatment at 9.5 kV discharge voltage for more than 10 min, the decolorization efficiency hardly increased with duration, and no statistical difference was observed. A reasonable reason is that the DBD reactor was overheated after operating for several minutes under the discharge voltage of 9.5 kV (Miruka et al. 2021). The overheating was caused by the energy consumption during discharge. It can be inferred that the high temperature destroyed the stability of O3 gas, and also affected the discharge characteristics of the DBD reactor. In order to reduce the influence of O3 decomposition caused by excessive temperature rise, the subsequent experiments were carried out at the discharge voltage of 8.6 kV. Furthermore, for the process of large-scale wastewater treatment, overheating of the reactors are needed to be avoided via adequate cooling or appropriate reduction of the discharge voltage.\n://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/87/3/598/1172616/wst087030598.pdf\nDownloaded fr by guest on 11 January"

            "text": "The mixture of MB liquid flow and O3 airflow was pumped into the microchannel reactor by a peristaltic pump. Since the MB liquid plugs were separated by O3 gas pockets, a plunger flow was formed in the microchannel. The liquid flow rate of the MB solution can affect the length of the liquid plug, thus affecting the decolorization efficiency. As the liquid flow rate increases, the decolorization efficiency will therefore be improved as more MB solutions are involved in the degradation enhanced by microchannel. However, the increased liquid flow rate also led to a shorter residence time of the plunger flow in the microchannel, which could reduce the decolorization efficiency. Due to these two opposite effects on the decolorization efficiency, the effect of liquid flow rate was necessary to be studied. Experiments were conducted in O3/MC system with the liquid flow rates ranging from 5 to 20 mL/min, the discharge voltage was 8.6 kV, the microchannel width was 1.2 mm, the initial pH was 7, and the reaction temperature was 23 \u00b0C. Reynolds (Re) numbers were used to analyse the dominant hydrodynamic conditions of microfluidics at varying liquid flow rates. The computed Re number increased from 5.6 to 22.4 when the liquid flow rate increased from 5 to 20 mL/min. These low Re numbers indicate that the prevailing flow was laminar, hence the mass transfer process was diffusion controlled. In addition, the actual Re numbers should be slightly higher than the calculated values, because the significant mixing effect of ultrasound changed the inertia and viscous force of the microfluidics in the microchannel.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the decolorization efficiency increased when the liquid flow rate increased from 5 to 15 mL/min. A maximum decolorization efficiency of 86.2% was obtained within 14 min at a liquid flow rate of 15 mL/min. Nevertheless, if the liquid flow rate was higher than 15 mL/min, there was a negative effect on the MB decolorization. Correspondingly, kinetic studies revealed that the first-order rate constants were 0.046, 0.054, 0.058, and 0.054 s 1, when the liquid flow rates were 5, 10, 15, and 20 mL/min, respectively. The liquid flow rate affected both the specific surface area of the plunger flow and the residence time of the liquid slug in the microchannel. As the liquid flow rate increased from 5 to 15 mL/min, more MB solution entered the microchannel to involve in the enhanced ozonation degradation. Furthermore, the liquid convective effect in the microchannel was also intensified (Chaurasiya & Singh 2022), so the decolorization efficiency was increased. When the liquid flow rate increased from 15 to 20 mL/min, the liquid slugs of the plunger flow were excessively lengthened, thus reducing the gas\u2013liquid mass transfer efficiency (Zhang et al. 2022). Additionally, the increasing liquid flow rate shortened the residence time of MB in microchannels, which also decreased the decolorization efficiency.\nom http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/87/3/598/1172616/wst087030598.pdf 2024\nDownloaded from http by guest on 11 January 2024"

The effects of microchannel widths ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 mm on MB decolorization were investigated. Experiments were carried out in O3 and O3/MC systems at initial pH of 7, reaction temperature of 23 \u00b0C, discharge voltage of 8.6 kV, and liquid flow rate of 15 mL/min. The Re numbers of the microfluids in the microchannels were 50.4, 33.6, 25.2, 20.2, and 16.8, when the inner diameters of the microchannels were 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mm, respectively.\nAs shown in Figure 5, by comparing the results obtained in O3 and O3/MC systems, a combined effect of microchannel on ozonation degradation was clearly observed. The decolorization efficiency increased first and then decreased with the increasing microchannel width. When the microchannel width was 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mm, the 14-min decolorization efficiency reached 79.7, 82.8, 86.2, 84.7, and 80.4%, respectively. Additionally, the corresponding rate constants determined by kinetic studies were 0.066, 0.072, 0.076, 0.072, and 0.058 s 1, respectively. When the microchannel width increased from 0.4 to 0.8 mm, the 14-min decolorization efficiency increased from 79.7 to 86.2%. The improvement of decolorization efficiency can be attributed to the fact that the residence time of MB solution in the microchannel increased with the increase of microchannel width. Since the sufficient residence time ensured the contact time of MB solution and O3 gas, the decolorization efficiency was improved. When the microchannel width increased from 0.8 to 1.2 mm, the 14-min decolorization efficiency decreased from 86.2 to 80.4%. Since the prevailing flow in the microchannel was laminar, the gas\u2013liquid mass transfer process was largely realized by molecular diffusion. The reduction of the microchannel width meant a faster molecular diffusion rate (Bingham&Dunham 1997). Therefore, despite the decreasing microchannel width reducing the residence time of the MB solution in the microchannel, the MB decolorization efficiency was still improved due to the significant enhancement of the gas\u2013liquid mass transfer."

The 14-min decolorization efficiency reached 86.6, 89.1, and 90.4%, with corresponding kinetic rate constants as 0.99, 1.01, and 1.06 s 1, when the ultrasonic powers were 33, 66, and 100 W, respectively. The phenomenon that the application of ultrasound can promote decolorization is ascribed to the micromixing effect and thermal activation effect caused by acoustic streaming and acoustic cavitation, respectively (Ileri & Dogu 2022). With the increase of ultrasonic power, the reactions of O3 decomposition into reactive species were promoted. The energized radicals initiated a series of chain reactions with O3 to form extra free radicals (Chen et al. 2009). In the current experimental setup, the minimum power required for ultrasonic cavitation was about 33 W. Nonetheless, at high power levels (exceeded 66 W), the improvement of decolorization efficiency with the increase of ultrasonic power was not obvious. Excessive ultrasonic power resulted in bubble coalescence, bubble clustering, and acoustic impedance, thus reducing the cavitation effect. Thangavadivel et al. (2014) studied ultrasound-assisted decolorization of methyl orange in a microreactor. The results show that when the ultrasonic power was increased from 160 to 200 W, the decolorization efficiency was increased by less than 0.3%. The above observation by Thangavadivel et al. was consistent with Figure 6, which was also due to the obstruction of the cavitation process by excessive cavitation bubbles.\nIn addition, the ultrasonic oscillator was overheated after a long-time operation, which is common in the applications of ultrasonic devices. In this study, the temperature rise generated by ultrasound was controlled by a constant temperature water circulation. The temperature difference between the inlet and the outlet of the microchannel remained within 3\u20135 \u00b0C, which was low enough to avoid the interference of temperature rise on MB decolorization."

During the decolorization processes, the O3 gas was released into the MB solution and stayed in the wide-mouth flask for several seconds. Since the spontaneous decomposition of O3 into oxygen was promoted by the temperature rise, partial O3 molecules could not complete the decolorization reactions before their lifetime achievements. In addition, the excessive temperature in the microchannel has been reported to hinder the mass transfer of gas molecules into the solutions (Lian et al. 2021), thus further reducing the decolorization efficiency."

Therefore, the initial pH needs to be studied as a significant factor for ozonation degradation. It has been reported that when the pH value exceeds 11, excessive alkalinity has a scavenging effect on HO\u2022. On the contrary, when the pH value is less than 5, the hydrolysis of O3 is negligible (Kalmaz & Trieff 1986), and no longer dependent on pH. Based on the aforementioned studies, the effect of initial pH on MB decolorization was examined in the pH range of 3\u201311. The experiments were performed in the O3/MC/US system with a reaction temperature of 23 \u00b0C, a discharge voltage of 8.6 kV, a liquid flow rate of 15 mL/min, a microchannel width of 0.8 mm, an Re number of 25.2, and an ultrasonic power of 100 W.\nAs shown in Figure 8, the decolorization was observed to conform to a first-order kinetic model, and the rate constants were 0.55, 0.78, 1.06, and 1.20 s 1, when the initial pH values were 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, respectively. Since the HO\u2022 yield was effectively increased by the increase of HO dosage, the 14-min decolorization efficiency increased from 84.6 to 93.2% when the initial pH increased from 3 to 11. O3 interacts selectively with organics in a molecular state under acidic or circumneutral pH. While under the alkaline conditions (Munter 2001), O3 is easily hydrolyzed to produce highly reactive free radicals, mainly HO\u2022. An obvious conversion of O3 to HO\u2022 (k\u00bc 2.2 106 M 1s 1) was confirmed at a pH of 9 (Gunten 2003; Fajardo et al. 2013). HO has been proven to be an initiator and promoter of O3 hydrolysis, as described by Equations (4)\u2013(9) (Hoigne & Bader 1983).\nO3 \u00feHO ! HO 2 \u00feO2 (4) HO 2 \u00feO3 !

The slight improvement of the decolorization efficiency can be attributed to the gradual decrease in decolorization efficiency with the decrease of MB concentration (Zhang et al. 2013). Since a satisfactory efficiency can be obtained with a pH of both 9 and 11, an initial pH of 9 was chosen as a condition for subsequent experiments in consideration of saving reagents."

In this study, scavenging experiments were conducted to investigate the contribution rates of HO\u2022 in O3, O3/MC and O3/MC/US systems.

The reaction temperature was 23 \u00b0C, initial pH was 9, discharge voltage was 8.6 kV, liquid flow rate was 15 mL/min, microchannel width was 0.8 mm, the corresponding Re number was 25.2, and ultrasonic power was 100 W.\n://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/87/3/598/1172616/wst087030598.pdf\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/87/3/598/1172616/wst087030598.pdf by guest on 11 January 2024\nDownloaded from http by guest on 11 January 2024\nAs shown in Figure 10(a), in O3/MC/US system, the addition of t-BuOH showed an obvious inhibition in MB decolorization. The 14-min decolorization efficiency was 86.9, 79.9, and 78.3% with the t-BuOH concentrations of 30, 50, and 100%, respectively. If the t-BuOH concentration was higher than 50%, the decolorization efficiency was almost no longer related to the t-BuOH dosage. A reasonable explanation is the indirect ozonation caused by HO\u2022 was largely inhibited, and only the direct ozonation caused by O3 dominated the decolorization. The decolorization efficiency obtained with the inhibition of the radical scavenger was higher than that of some previous studies. This phenomenon can be attributed to the enhanced effect of microchannel and ultrasound on gas\u2013liquid mass transfer. In O3/MC/US system, the nucleophilic attack of O3 was enhanced, so the decolorization efficiency can be maintained at a high level even after the HO\u2022 was quenched.\nFigure 10(b) shows the time-courses of MB decolorization with and without t-BuOH addition in O3, O3/MC and O3/MC/ US systems. The complete scavenging of HO\u2022 reduced the 14-min decolorization efficiency by 9.8, 13.5, and 14.4% in O3, O3/ MC, and O3/MC/US systems, respectively. Based on these results, the contribution rates of HO\u2022 were calculated and shown in Figure 10(c). Qi et al. (2015) found that the 5-min and 15-min contribution rates of HO\u2022 reached about 18 and 11% in the catalytic ozonation of phenacetin. Figure 10(c) shows that in O3 system, the 5-min and 14-min contribution rates of HO\u2022 reached about 26 and 12%, which were similar to the experimental results obtained by Qi et al. (2015). In addition, as the decolorization progressed from 2 to 14 min, the contribution rates of HO\u2022 decreased from about 50% to less than 20% in either system. As the decolorization proceeded, various small acidic molecules were produced as the intermediate products. The acidified solution hindered the HO\u2022 generation, thereby reducing the MB decolorization efficiency, which has been explained by Figure 8. Moreover, the contribution rates of HO\u2022 in O3/MC/US system were higher than those in O3/MC and O3 system under the same experimental conditions. The 14-min contribution rates of HO\u2022 were about 15.5, 14.8, and 12.2% in O3/MC/US, O3/MC, and O3 systems, respectively. As shown in Figure 10(b) and 10(c), the improvement rate on MB decolorization under the effect of ultrasound was not remarkably high. However, this is an observable trend, and could prove that ultrasound can enhance the ozonation process. During the experiments, the comprehensive effect of microchannel and ultrasound on the MB decolorization was existed. The MB decolorization efficiency was increased by 2.4% within 14 min due to the enhancement effect of ultrasound.\nIn addition, considering the complex chain reactions and interactions between reactive species, it was difficult to quantify all the contributors and precisely calculate their contributions. Therefore, the contribution rates obtained in this study were estimated values. Anyhow, the highest contribution rate of HO\u2022 was clearly observed in O3/MC/US system. The combination effects of microchannel and ultrasound were confirmed to promote the indirect ozonation caused by HO\u2022, thus increasing the MB decolorization efficiency."

The effects of discharge voltage, liquid flow rate, microchannel width, ultrasonic power, initial pH and reaction temperature on decolorization performance were investigated. The results show that the MB decolorization efficiency could be increased by an increasing discharge voltage, ultrasonic power, and initial pH, as well as a decreasing reaction temperature. The decolorization efficiency would be increased by an appropriate liquid flow rate, but would be decreased by both insufficient and excessive liquid flow rates. An increase of microchannel width in the proper range would be conducive to the color removal, otherwise, the excessive microchannel width would even cause a decrease in decolorization efficiency. For 100 mL MB solution with an initial concentration of 0.04 mM, a 14-min decolorization efficiency of 92.7% was obtained in the O3/MC/US system, which was 12.6% higher than that in the pure O3 system.
