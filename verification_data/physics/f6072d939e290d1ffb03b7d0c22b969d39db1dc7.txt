"Our major finding is that accounting for multiple cavity modes can enhance the Marcus theory rate constant by several orders of magnitude in comparison to the single-mode case. Furthermore, the additional enhancement is cumulative and cannot be explained by a single dominant mode. Another finding is that the rate is affected by a finite number of cavity modes whose frequency lies below a cutoff frequency. A detailed analysis of the conditions necessary for maximizing this effect and its dependence on the reaction energy and reorganization energy was presented in the case of the Marcus limit of FGR rate theory."
