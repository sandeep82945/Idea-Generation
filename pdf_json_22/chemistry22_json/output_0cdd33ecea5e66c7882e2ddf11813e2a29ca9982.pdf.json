    "abstractText": "Curcumin and germacrone, natural products present in the Zingiberaceae family of plants, have several biological properties. Among these properties, the anti-NSCLC cancer action is noteworthy. In this paper, kinetics of the two compounds in rat liver microsomes (RLMs), human liver microsomes (HLMs), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1, and 2C19) in an NADPH-generating system in vitro were evaluated by UP-HPLC\u2013MS/MS (ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry). The contents of four cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, adjusting by the compounds were detected using Western blotting in vitro and in vivo. The t1/2 of curcumin was 22.35 min in RLMs and 173.28 min in HLMs, while 18.02 and 16.37 min were gained for germacrone. The Vmax of curcumin in RLMs was about 4-fold in HLMs, meanwhile, the Vmax of germacrone in RLMs was similar to that of HLMs. The single enzyme t1/2 of curcumin was 38.51 min in CYP3A4, 301.4 min in 1A2, 69.31 min in 2E1, 63.01 min in 2C19; besides, as to the same enzymes, t1/2 of germacrone was 36.48 min, 86.64 min, 69.31 min, and 57.76 min. The dynamic curves were obtained by reasonable experimental design and the metabolism of curcumin and germacrone were selected in RLMs/HLMs. The selectivities in the two liver microsomes differed in degradation performance. These results meant that we should pay more attention to drugs in clinical medication\u2013drug and drug\u2013enzyme interactions.",

It severely endangers human health and life [1]. Curcumin and germacrone (Figure 1) are the main active ingredients in the Zingiberaceae family of plants such as Curcuma aromatica Salisb., C. longa L. [2]. It was reported that curcumin and germacrone showed strong anti-NSCLC cancer effects and are easy to be obtained from natural medicine [3\u20136]. NSCLC cancer requires an expensive clinical treatment [7], so curcumin and germacrone are promising for the development of new NSCLC drugs. Preclinical studies are always useful for a prospective new drug [8,9]; meanwhile, the kinetics offer use as a model in preclinical research [10,11]. The blood pharmacokinetics and urodynamics with curcumin or germacrone in rats were reported [12\u201314], but no more studies on kinetics of curcumin and germacrone with the liver microsomes metabolism were conducted. The liver microsomes are rich in CYP, associating with drug metabolism and biotransformation [15,16]. The candidate drugs pharmacokinetic properties and characteristics in vivo can be predicted through detecting the metabolic rates and enzyme kinetics characteristics in vitro [17\u201319].

According to the literatures, curcumin has been evaluated the metabolites with an 18O isotope labeling strategy in HLMs [23]. The interaction of zederone and germacrone with the main human liver CYPs, the sensor regulators, and the potential protected effect for liver were explored [24]. It is well known that the metabolism of drug candidates in humans may different from that of other species; meanwhile, the variety of metabolites and the concentrations can be potentially affected by the bioactivities and toxicities in vivo. Compared with in vivo, the interference of endogenous substances can be avoided in vitro and can also be observed the interaction between agent and target.

            "text": "Curcumin and germacrone are thought to possess a lot of beneficial bioactivities, including anti-NSCLC cancer and antiviral effects, and obtained from raw materials [30\u201333]. So, curcumin and germacrone are very promising to develop the new NSCLC drugs. Enriching the species difference information of selective of curcumin or germacrone between human and experimental animals are of great significance in new drug development. Hence, the kinetic degradation in human single recombinant CYP enzymes of CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1, 2C19, enzyme kinetics of curcumin or germacrone with RLMs or HLMs were examined in present study. There are reports that the relationship between CYP enzymes with drugs can be provided a better guidance for clinical drug combination [34,35]. Therefore, we went on exploring the potential influence of two compounds on the CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1 and 2C19 enzyme in order to provide more insight on drug-drug combination in clinic. The t1/2 as a prerequisite for medicinal properties, and it was need to be more than 30 min in the liver microsomes [36,37]. To obtain the kinetic degradation between curcumin and germacrone with liver microsomes, curcumin and germacrone incubation with NADPH regeneration system in RLMs or HLMs for 120 min. The t1/2 of curcumin or germacrone with RLMs or HLMs were first investigated in this paper. The results showed that the degradation of curcumin or germacrone were related to substrate concentrations and incubation time. There was little metabolic degradation of curcumin or germacrone in liver microsomes without NADPH regeneration system, meaning that, the degradation of curcumin and germacrone were NADPH-dependent. The degradation curve of curcumin or germacrone incubation in RLMs and HLMs with NADPH indicated that the concentrations of curcumin or germacrone were different at the same time point. The t1/2 of curcumin and germacrone in RLMs was 22.35 and 18.02 min, while, it was 173.28 and 16.37 min in HLMs, respectively. The t1/2 of curcumin in HLMs was almost 8-fold than that in RLMs, meaning that curcumin affinity with RLMs stronger than that of HLMs. But the t1/2 of germacrone in RLMs was similar as in HLMs. From the data, the degradation of curcumin was much faster in RLMs than that in HLMs, but germacrone was stronger in HLMs than that in RLMs. The selective of curcumin markedly differed among species in RLMs and HLMs, but germacrone had a weak selective. Kinetic analyses of curcumin or germacrone selectived in RLMs and HLMs were subsequently performed at a broad range of substrate concentrations. Both the kinetics of curcumin and germacrone in those liver microsomes fitted the Michaelis-Menten model. The Vmax and CLint for curcumin in RLMs were markedly higher than in HLMs. Inversely, the Vmax and CLint for germacrone in HLMs were higher than in RLMs. The Km for curcumin in RLMs also were markedly higher than in HLMs, but germacrone in HLMs higher than in RLMs. Contrasted with HLMs, the degradation and enzyme kinetics of curcumin had a stronger potency to deplete in RLMs, but germacrone did the opposition. There may be some possible factors that led to the results. The biological competitive inhibition, transformation, interaction between compounds led to unconformity of the affinity, metabolic capability, the chemical structures, and the selection of different degradation enzymes were all can change in RLMs and HLMs [38\u201340]. The metabolic rate of drugs are mainly determined by the enzyme activity and content. Currently reported about curcumin and germacrone on CYP enzyme activity in vitro, but no enzyme content. In inhibitory experiment with enzyme activity, curcumin inhibited effects on CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1 and 2C19, with IC50 of 24.27 \u00b5M, 92.60 \u00b5M, 172.05 \u00b5M and 11.86 \u00b5M, and germacrone inhibited effects on the same CYP enzymes, with IC50 of 3.57 \u00b5M, 78.06 \u00b5M, 120.35 \u00b5M and 17.84 \u00b5M, respectively. The results were generally consistent with those reports, which CYP3A4, 1A2 were effected by germacrone [24,41]. This study for curcumin and germacrone on CYP enzyme can enrich their activity and content. In the metabolism with single enzyme experiment, t1/2 of curcumin in CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1 and 2C19 were 38.51, 301.4, 69.31 and 63.01 min, meanwhile, t1/2 of germacrone in the same enzymes were 36.48, 86.64, 69.31 and 57.76 min, respectively. These results meant that CYP3A4 and 2C19 could be inhibited by curcumin or germacrone significantly, and\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4482 9 of 15\ncurcumin or germacrone also was metabolized simultaneously by CYP3A4 and 2C19. Combined with the kinetics, it was reasonable assumed that the metabolic rate was affected by enzyme content. To demonstrate this assumption, the enzyme expression was analyzed using Western blotting in vitro. Further demonstrates for the metabolic rate was associated with enzyme content levels in RLMs and HLMs. Moreover, the protein expressions of CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1 and 2C19 were decreased by curcumin, while germacrone did the opposition in vivo. The t1/2 of the four proprietary enzyme substrates were enhanced in curcumin but shortened in germacrone in vivo. Thus, the metabolic rate was related to content enzyme. Drug combination always uses to improve the effective treatment and reduce toxicity in clinic, such as nintedanib, icotinib, erlotinib and pembrolizumab are frequently used as a combination drug for NSCLC patients [42\u201345]. Erlotinib is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 [46]. Interestingly, curcumin had inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 enzymes. Currently, curcumin combined with afatinib in NSCLC treatment has been patented and applied in clinic. Can t1/2 of the erlotinib be appropriately prolonged when combined with curcumin? This study provides new insights and ideas for developing target new drugs, the combination with other cancer drugs in clinical practice."
