    "abstractText": "In this study, we present the synthesis of a novel peptide-based magnetogel obtained through the encapsulation of \u03b3-Fe2O3-polyacrylic acid (PAA) nanoparticles (\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs) into a hydrogel matrix, used for enhancing the ability of the hydrogel to remove Cr(III), Co(II), and Ni(II) pollutants from water. Fmoc-Phe (Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-Phenylalanine) and diphenylalanine (Phe2) were used as starting reagents for the hydrogelator (Fmoc-Phe3) synthesis via an enzymatic method. The PAA-coated magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized in a separate step, using the co-precipitation method, and encapsulated into the peptide-based hydrogel. The resulting organic/inorganic hybrid system (\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs-peptide) was characterized with different techniques, including FT-IR, Raman, UV-Vis, DLS, \u03b6-potential, XPS, FESEM-EDS, swelling ability tests, and rheology. Regarding the application in heavy metals removal from aqueous solutions, the behavior of the obtained magnetogel was compared to its precursors and the effect of the magnetic field was assessed. Four different systems were studied for the separation of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions, including (1) \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs stabilized with PAA, (\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs); (2) Fmoc-Phe3 hydrogel (HG); (3) \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs embedded in peptide magnetogel (\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG); and (4) \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG in the presence of an external magnetic field. To quantify the removal efficiency of these four model systems, the UV-Vis technique was employed as a fast, cheap, and versatile method. The results demonstrate that both Fmoc-Phe3 hydrogel and \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs peptide magnetogel can efficiently remove all the tested pollutants from water. Interestingly, due to the presence of magnetic \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs inside the hydrogel, the removal efficiency can be enhanced by applying an external magnetic field. The proposed magnetogel represents a smart multifunctional nanosystem with improved absorption efficiency and synergic effect upon applying an external magnetic field. These results are promising for potential environmental applications of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs-peptide magnetogels to the removal of pollutants from aqueous media.",

            "text": "Worldwide, due to the increase in industrialization levels, the protection of the environment from industrial wastes has become more and more important over the past decades. The presence of toxic metal ions in industrial wastewaters can result in adverse effects on both human health and the environment even at low concentrations because these inorganic species are generally nondegradable in nature [1\u20133]. Some of the most\nGels 2023, 9, 621. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9080621 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2023, 9, 621 2 of 24\ncommon metal pollutants are cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), arsenic (As), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), and zinc (Zn). Table 1 summarizes the primary industrial sources, health side effects and the permitted quantity of these heavy metals, based on recent literature data [4\u20138].\nTVs, computer monitors\n1 The data for cobalt (Co) were taken from references [5,6].\nIn the past decades, there have been admirable efforts to develop fast and efficient techniques to remove metal ions from aqueous solutions, and different approaches have been studied and developed for water remediation, including ion exchange, electrochemical treatments, membrane separation, and flocculation [1,9]. However, these methods often suffer from their own limitations in terms of complexity, cost, and efficiency. In recent years, sol- and gel-based adsorption strategies have attracted increasing attention for scaling-up the removal process because of their simplicity, high efficiency, and low-cost operation. To this aim, polymers, clay minerals, and carbon-based materials have been investigated as adsorbents, and promising results have been obtained in this regard [10\u201314]. On this basis, an ideal adsorbent should have high adsorption capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, good chemical stability, and easy preparation method [2]. Hydrogels have been recently introduced as suitable alternatives as absorbent materials due to their highly porous structure and adsorbing functional groups, as well as their large surface area and high swelling ability [15\u201321]. They are colloidal materials that possess a three-dimensional (3D) network based on amphipathic polymer building blocks. The polymers link to each other, forming an insoluble 3D matrix that can absorb and entrap\nGels 2023, 9, 621 3 of 24\na significant amount of water [22,23]. For water treatment applications, it is highly recommended to use biocompatible absorbents, and among them, peptide-based hydrogels for example can be suitable candidates [1,15]. In general, hydrogels can absorb large amounts of metal ions inside their matrices, due to the presence of suitable functional groups. As is well-known, on this basis, hydrogels physically or chemically interact with pollutants via one or more mechanisms. One of the major mechanisms of heavy metals removal by hydrogels is based on electrostatic interactions that usually occur when, as a function of pH, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of hydrogels are deprotonated, imparting negative charges to the hydrogel. Other possible interactions involve H-bond formation. These types of hydrogels can be easily used and scaled up for industrial applications of wastewater treatment because of their cost-effectiveness and standard synthetic methods. In particular, they can be prepared by using an enzymatic approach and under mild conditions, which are highly suitable for large-scale production [19,24]. To enhance hydrogels adsorption efficiency and reduce their operational costs, they can be hybridized (or combined) with magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) to form \u201cmagnetogels\u201d, which are promising organic-inorganic nanohybrids for environmental and biological applications, as they combine benefits of both hydrogels and magnetic nanoparticles into a single inorganic/organic hybrid [25\u201332]. In fact, magnetic sorbents entrapped within hydrogel-based materials can promote heavy metals removal thanks to the large number of functional groups on hydrogel surfaces, thus improving adsorption selectivity as well as sorbent capacity. These magnetogels are considered as soft smart multifunctional nanosystems, which provide the possibility for enhancing the adsorption efficiency of hydrogels upon applying an external magnetic field. In addition, the presence of magnetic nanoparticles can modify hydrogels\u2019 structure through covalent or non-covalent interactions, which offers the possibility to finely tune their physico-chemical properties. The porous magnetogels present in their structure active functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino groups) that are able to remove contaminants by means of electrostatic interactions, ionic exchange, or complexation with contaminants such as heavy metal ions. More importantly, the interaction of magnetogels with an external magnetic field can promote the separation, collection, and reuse of hydrogel adsorbents and also have an enhancing effect on the adsorption of magnetogels [28]. Among the various types of magnetic NPs, maghemite (\u03b3-Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles have been employed for biological and environmental applications due to their high magnetization, biocompatibility, and well-assessed synthesis methods [25]. These two types of magnetic nanoparticles both exhibit strong on/off superparamagnetic properties in the presence/absence of a magnetic field, respectively. Although maghemite NPs (\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs) show a slightly smaller magnetic moment compared to magnetite NPs (Fe3O4NPs), they are more stable in air and have the benefits of possessing a much lower optical absorption in the visible region [33], suitable for biotechnologies. For water remediation applications, \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs can act as photocatalysts to break down and remove various organic contaminants. To date, various nanocomposite-based \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs have been used as adsorbents to remove different metallic- and organic-based contaminants from aqueous solutions (drinking water, groundwater, wastewater, and acid mine drainage) with significant adsorption efficiency. The pollutants include heavy metal ions and several dyes (e.g., methyl orange (MO), methylene blue (MB), rose bengal, Congo red (CR), brilliant cresyl blue, thionine, and Janus green B) [34,35]. Although several worthwhile water purification studies have been performed using magnetogels [26,36\u201339], only a few water remediation applications of peptide-based magnetogels are known. Thus, it is worth studying this topic to gain more insight toward the development of advanced and smart biocompatible adsorbents. Concerning magnetogels synthesis, several methods have been introduced, such as blending [40], grafting [41], in situ precipitation [42], and swelling [43]. Among these methods, the swelling strategy is considered as an in situ methodology, and the magnetogels are prepared in one step. On the other side, blending and grafting methods are known as \u201cex situ\u201d strategies, and the magnetogels are synthesized in more than one step [27].\nGels 2023, 9, 621 4 of 24\nRegarding the blending method, it is based on sequential syntheses of the components, starting with the magnetic NPs, which are then blended with hydrogel precursors to make the resultant magnetogels. Despite the simplicity of the blending method, the magnetic nanoparticles may have an interfering effect on hydrogel formation and also have a negative influence on the final structure of the gel. Moreover, lack of proper stabilization of nanoparticles can result in their heterogeneous distribution or diffusion out of the gel upon swelling [27]. Based on the interaction of MNPs with the hydrogel network, magnetogels are classified into class I and class II, as discussed by Weeber et al. [27]. In class I magnetogels, nanoparticles have a weak interaction with the hydrogel network (also called blends) through physical interactions, e.g., nanoparticles embedded in the aqueous compartments or adsorbed onto the fibers. On the other hand, class II magnetogels exhibit strong interactions among MNPs and hydrogel fibers, through covalent bonding or strong physical forces [27]. From an industrial point of view, the synthesis of novel magnetic hybrid sorbents with improved properties in terms of sorbent efficiency or ability to simultaneously introduce different extraction approaches is highly desirable. Hence, due to the importance of magnetogels, we studied the synthesis, characterization, and potential water remediation application of novel peptide-based magnetogel nanocomposites by ex situ encapsulation of polyacrylic acid (PAA)-modified iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs) into a peptide hydrogel matrix (\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG). The \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs were synthesized by the well-known co-precipitation method, and for the hydrogel matrix, Fmoc-Phe and diphenylalanine (Phe2) were used as starting materials for the hydrogelator synthesis through an enzymatic reaction [44]. The magnetogel nanocomposite was characterized using different spectroscopic, morphological, and structural techniques and applied to the separation of Cr(III), Co(II), and Ni(II) from aqueous solutions. The effects of contact time and an external magnetic field on the adsorption efficiency of the different contaminants were investigated."

            "text": "Co-precipitation is known as a simple and cheap method to synthesize magnetic iron oxide NPs (\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs) from aqueous solutions of Fe(II) and Fe(III) by the addition of a base as a precipitating agent at mild temperature, and a large amount of NPs can be prepared by this method. The co-precipitation process, schematized in Figure 1a, does not require organic solvents or toxic precursor iron complexes and proceeds at temperatures below 100 \u25e6C. More importantly, it can be developed and scaled up from lab to industry due to its simplicity, reproducibility, and eco-friendly reaction conditions. However, this method sometimes suffers from a lack of control over particle size distribution, probably because of the complicated set of pathways that lead to the formation of NPs [45]. The general mechanism for the formation of MNPs first involves hydroxylation of the ferrous and ferric ions to form Fe(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3, respectively. These two low-soluble hydroxides (Kps (25 \u25e6C) = 7.9 \u00d7 10\u221215 and 6.3 \u00d7 10\u221238, for ferrous and ferric hydroxide, respectively [46]) can be obtained at alkaline pHs (pH > 8), and when NaOH is used as the precipitating agent, a black colloidal solution of iron containing NPs is formed instantaneously. By applying a 2:1 molar ratio of Fe(III):Fe(II) and an oxygen-free environment, magnetite NPs (Fe3O4NPs) are the main product of this reaction through the following possible reactions (Equations (1)\u2013(4)) [45]:\nFe(III) + 3OH\u2212 \u2192 Fe(OH)3 (1)\nFe(OH)3 \u2192 FeOOH + H2O (2)\nFe(II) + 2OH\u2212 \u2192 Fe(OH)2 (3)\n2FeOOH + Fe(OH)2 \u2192 Fe3O4NPs\u2193+ 2H2 (4)\nGels 2023, 9, 621 5 of 24\nGels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 24 amino acids [27]. These are some important benefits of PAA for its applications as composite adsorbents. For instance, PAA-functionalized magnetic magnetite particles have been used as an adsorbent for basic dyes [53,55,56]. For the above reasons, we synthesized the magnetic NPs stabilized by PAA using the in situ strategy to obtain small and colloidally stable \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs, followed by preparation of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG magnetogel. The isolation of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs was first confirmed by the visual magnetic behavior of the purified precipitates. As can be seen in Figures 1b and S1, the particles are strongly attracted to the external magnet and easily redispersed after removing the magnet. To confirm the stabilizing effect of PAA, uncoated magnetic NPs were also synthesized, using the same reaction conditions but without the presence of PAA. For the synthesis of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG magnetogels, we have used the blending strategy mentioned in the\nintroduction section as a well-known method to synthesize magnetogels [25,27]. This\nmethod is based on sequential syntheses of the components, starting with the magnetic\nNPs, which are then blended with hydrogel precursors to make the resulting\nmagnetogels. The formation of the hydrogel followed a well-assessed procedure, using a\nmicrobial lipase to catalyze the synthesis in water of self-assembling peptides generated\nby the peptide bond formation between 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-phenylalanine\n(Fmoc\u2013Phe) and the dipeptide diphenylalanine (Phe2) (Figure 1c) [57].\nFigure 1.

In maghemite, this band splits into two characteristic vibrations, due to the\nFigure 1.

Due to the presence of reduced iron (Fe(II)) in this crystal structure, Fe3O4NPs are easily subject to oxidation and are transformed to a more stable maghemite ph se (\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs) by the following equati (Equati n (5)) [47]:\n3Fe3O4NPs + 0.5O2 + 2H+ \u2192 4\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs + Fe2+ + H2O (5)\nAnother important aspect of iron-based NPs is their colloidal stability after the synthesis. Due to their magnetic properties, iron-based NPs are more vulnerable to agglomeration because of the magnetic attraction among particles. In general, colloidal stability is the result of a balance between repulsive interactions (steric and electrostatic) and attractive forces (Van der Waals, dipolar, and magnetic), which can be influenced by the medium parameters, including composition, pH, and ionic strength [48]. To enhance their colloidal stability, MNPs should be stabilized by steric, electrostatic, or a combination of these repulsive forces. In the electrostatic stabilization, the repulsive forces between the NPs originate from likewise charges [49], and for the steric stabilization, the presence of large molecules provides a repulsive hindrance for the surface of NPs [22]. Steric stabilization is usually favored because it is less sensitive to medium parameters and therefore more suitable when MNPs are in contact with complex media [50\u201352]. To this aim, several small and large stabilizing agents have been applied for the surface functionalization of MNPs, such as polymers (polytrolox ester, PAA, and polyacrylic-co-maleic acid), natural antioxidants (green tea polyphenols, curcumin, quercetin, and anthocyanins) and organic or inorganic acids (gallic, ascorbic, citric, and humic acid) [53]. Among these stabilizers, the functionalization of magnetic NPs with PAA provides both steric and electrostatic effects on the NPs\u2019 surface [54]. The electrostatic effect of PAA originates from its carboxylate groups, and the steric effect from its polymeric nature. For water purification applications, PAA is known for its ability to absorb a large amount of water and is used as a superabsorbent. Another advantage of PAA is its biocompatibility which is highly desirable [40]. For the PAA functionalization of NPs, two methods are generally used: in situ and post (ex situ) surface coating. For in situ functionalization, PAA is used simultaneously with the iron precursors\nGels 2023, 9, 621 6 of 24\nduring the synthesis of magnetic NPs, and both synthesis and functionalization occur simultaneously in one step. For the post (ex situ) method, PAA is added to pre-synthesized NPs in a separate step (next step) from the synthesis. Generally, the in situ method is more preferable due to the inhibition of particle growth in a high concentration of PAA. Also, the high hydrophilicity and colloidal stability induced by PAA stabilization of magnetic NPs can decrease the long gelation time of supramolecular magnetogels. For instance, it was reported that the stabilization of iron oxide NPs with polyacrylic acid allowed homogeneous encapsulation of NPs up to 30 m/m% in both Npx-L-Asp-Z-\u2206Phe-OH and Npx-L-Tyr-Z-\u2206Phe-OH hydrogels containing non-canonical amino acids [27]. These are some important benefits of PAA for its applications as composite adsorbents. For instance, PAA-functionalized magnetic magnetite particles have been used as an adsorbent for basic dyes [53,55,56]. For the above reasons, we synthesized the magnetic NPs stabilized by PAA using the in situ strategy to obtain small and colloidally stable \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs, followed by preparation of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG magnetogel. The isolation of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs was first confirmed by the visual magnetic behavior of the purified precipitates.

To confirm the stabilizing effect of PAA, uncoated magnetic NPs were also synthesized, using the same reaction conditions but without the presence of PAA.

Based on literature, the magnetite phase has a sharp and symmetrical vibration at around 571 cm\u22121, assigned to the Fe\u2013O bonds present in tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the spinel structure. It is a general characteristic band of iron oxide NPs, and its sharpness clarifies the pure defect-free phase. In maghemite, this band splits into two characteristic vibrations, due to the creation of vacancy defects and vanishing of Fe(II) ion from the octahedral sites upon the formation of \u03b3-Fe2O3, causing a decrease in Fe\u2013O bond length, and hence, corresponding splitting of the band occurs [59]. It should be mentioned that both phases (magnetite or maghemite) show a weak band in the 440\u2013460 cm\u22121 region [58]. Regarding the crystal structure, also group theory theoretically predicts that if the \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs have a spinel crystal, then there are four T1 modes expected at 212, 362, 440, and 553 cm\u22121 [60], of which we were able to only detect the highest two frequencies with our experimental setup.

DSL and UV-Vis Characterization of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs\nThe hydrodynamic size and surface charges of the two \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs systems (bare\nand coated with PAA) were studied by DLS and \u03b6-potential techniques (Figure 4a,b).\nCompared to uncoated \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs, PAA-coated \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs show smaller size and\nhigher negative surface charge, which can be a good indication of PAA coating and, more\nimportantly, PAA\u2019s stabilizing effect on the NPs. Using PAA in the in situ synthesis of\nNPs allows for controlling the size of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs because the attached PAA moiety\nprovides steric (by its polymeric nature) and electrostatic (by its \u2013COO\u2212 group)\nstabilizations, thus permitting \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs dispersion in aqueous media [54]. In fact, the\npresence of PAA on the surface of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs prolongs the colloidal stability by slowing\ndown the agglomeration process. Another major advantage of PAA is that the carboxylic\nacid-enriched surfaces of PAA-coated \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs may provide a platform for attaching\nthese NPs to other systems to prepare multifunctional nanohybrids. UV-Vis spectra of\nPAA-coated \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs (1.6\u20130.005 mg/mL) were monitored over a 7-day period to\ncharacterize their colloidal stability against agglomeration and sedimentation [74\u201376]. As\ncan be seen in Figure 4c, results show no significant changes in the intensities, indicating\nthe stability of the preparations against aggregation. The images of three PAA-coated\n\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs suspensions (1.6, 0.16, and 0.08 mg/mL) are shown in Figure S2a, in which no\nprecipitation was observed, consistent with the UV-Vis spectra (Figure 4c). Also, the\ncolloidal stability of higher concentrations of PAA-coated \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs (10 mg/mL) was\nvisually monitored over one week, and a remarkable stability of the NPs against\nsedimentation was observed. Conversely, uncoated \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs showed a fast\naggregation and sedimentation that were visually detected, even at low concentrations\n(Figure S2c). These results are consistent with previous studies on the use of organic\nmolecules as stabilizing agents for MNPs. However, the uncoated NPs showed a limited\namount of precipitation in the vials (Figure S2c), demonstrating the positive long-term\nstabilizing effect of PAA-coated \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs (Figure 4c). These results are comparable\nand consistent with the literature [27,40,53\u201356] about the stabilizing effect of PAA on\n\u03b3-Fe2O3NPs, explained in Section 2.1.\nFigure 3.

Figure 3c shows the XPS spectrum, where the signals due to ionization of Fe, C, O, and Na are visible, the latter resulting from the use of NaOH in the synthesis of PAA-coated \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs. Figure 3d shows the Fe 2p spectrum of PAA-coated \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs, which is composed of two rather broad spin-orbit split components (j = 3/2 and 1/2), whose maxima are separated by a \u2206Eso ~ 13.6 eV. This spectrum was curve-fitted in order to determine the oxidation state of the iron species. The curve-fitting procedure was conducted following the work by Grosvenor et al. [69,70], who applied a Shirley background removal to the 2p3/2 envelope and successfully used the Gupta and Sen (GS) multiplets calculated for free metal ions [71,72] to account for electrostatic interactions in high-spin Fe(II) an Fe(III) compounds [69,70]. Also in the pr sent case, a fiv -f ld GS multiplet for Fe(III) compounds w s used in the curve-fitting (green curves in Figure 3d, first component at 710.05 eV binding energy), achieving good match with the experimental data. This agre ment str ngly supports the attribution of this signal to \u03b3-Fe2O3, a reported by Grosvenor et al. A further two-fold multiplet was added at low binding energy (red curve in Figure 3d, first component at 708.17 eV bi ding energy), in order to better reproduce the experimental signal. This multiplet appe rs also in the spectrum by Grosvenor et al. as a \u201cpre-peak\u201d and might stem from residual Fe(II) h gh-spin comp nents possibly present n \u03b3-F 2O3 [69]."

In the following paragraphs, the results of the studies are reported.\n2.6.1. Co(II) Removal Studies\nCo(II)(aq) has a broad metal-based absorption peak in the visible region centered at 512 nm [90]. Over the whole removal process, the intensity of this peak decreases without significant change in the wavelength for all the three adsorbents (Figures 7a and S4) tested, i.e., HG, \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG, and \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG upon magnetic field application. In particular, in Figure 7a, the UV-Vis spectra of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG upon magnetic field application is reported. The adsorption capacity of these systems was monitored as a function of contact time (Co(II)initial = 61 mg/mL), and qt (in mg g\u22121) plots are shown in Figure 7b, with contact times ranging from 0 to 480 min. The adsorption capacities follow the trend \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG upon magnetic field application > \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG > HG, confirming the enhancing effect of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs on the adsorption. The interaction of magnetogel with an external magnet further increases the capacity, compared to that of the magnetogel. For each adsorbent, a fast Co(II) removal was observed in the first 15 min, which is due to the large number of active sites available on the hydrogel [91]. This rapid adsorption might be due to chemical rather than physical adsorption because of the possible complexation between the suitable functional groups of hydrogels and Co(II) ions. This phenomenon was already reported in several studies of Co(II) adsorption [16,92,93]. Then, their adsorption gradually slowed until reaching equilibrium after 480 min for all systems. At equilibrium, the capacity of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG upon magnetic field application is about 1.25 times higher than that of the other two adsorbents. Total adsorption efficiencies were estimated, and the results show that \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG and \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG upon magnetic field application increase the removal efficiency by 0.3% and 5.3%, respectively (Table 4), in comparison with hydrogel alone. Under these experimental conditions, the external magnetic field has a relevant effect on the adsorption capacity and efficiency of the hydrogel.\nGels 2023, 9, 621 13 of 24\nGels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 24 molecular system that reduces its symmetry and energy, seen in the complexes having the occupied eg levels. Therefore, the Co(II) ions in the dissolution process have high lability and are vulnerable to the chemical substitution reaction to achieve their stable electronic configurations. In fact, the presence of Fmoc-Phe and diphenylalanine (Phe2) in the hydrogel network can provide the chelating moiety (through their nitrogen and oxygen atoms) for the Co(II) ions, resulting in stable Co(II) complexes [97].\nRegarding the enhancing effect of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs nanoparticles, it is consistent with previous studies on magnetogels [98,99] and is related to the fact that NPs embedded in hydrogel can increase the cross-linking degree and porosity of the gel, providing a channel for the entry, exit, and adsorption of some substances [28]. More importantly, the interaction of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG with the external magnet further enhances the adsorption. As is well-known, magnetogels can exhibit an on/off effect on the hydrogel pores [27]. In fact, swelling or shrinking states of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG can be influenced by the magnetic dipole-dipole orientation of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs toward the external magnetic field [100] and can increase the permeability of Co(II) into the hydrogel network for the chemisorption [89,101].\nFigure 7.

To better understand the adsorption kinetics, two well-known kinetic models, pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order [91], were applied and evaluated using the given linearized equations (Equations (9) and (10)), as provided in Section 4.8. In general, the pseudo-first order model describes a reversible adsorption between solid and liquid phases [94], claiming physisorption rather than chemisorption. Conversely, the secondorder model mainly suggests a chemical adsorption of adsorbates onto the adsorbents [95], in which chemical bonding occurs among the metal ions and polar functional groups of the adsorbents. Two kinetic plots are shown in Figure 7c,d, and the subsequently calculated kinetics parameters are summarized in Table 5. Considering the correlation coefficient, R2 better-fitted straight lines were obtained from the pseudo-second order relation for all the adsorbents, compared to those obtained for the pseudo-first order plots. Moreover, the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacities, qe, obtained from the pseudo-second order equation were much closer to the experimental trend seen in Figure 7b. The results suggest that the adsorption of Co(II) onto our synthesized HG and \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG systems occurs through chemisorption, in agreement with previous works [96]. Also, we can clearly see the significant effect of magnetic interaction on the speed of adsorption, as shown in Table 5.\nGels 2023, 9, 621 14 of 24\nThe chemisorption of Co(II) can be interpreted based on the coordination chemistry of Co(II) aquo complexes, which are kinetically labile species. For substitution reactions, the transition metal kinetics are governed by their electronic configurations. For octahedral complexes, the d orbitals split into high energy eg (dz2 and dx2\u2212y2) and low energy T2g (dxz, dyz, dxy) levels, of which eg orbitals show anti-bonding characters. Due to the highspin d7 configuration of Co(II) aquo complexes having the T2g5 eg2, they also exhibit the Jahn-Teller effect (z-out), which is a geometric distortion of a non-linear molecular system that reduces its symmetry and energy, seen in the complexes having the occupied eg levels. Therefore, the Co(II) ions in the dissolution process have high lability and are vulnerable to the chemical substitution reaction to achieve their stable electronic configurations. In fact, the presence of Fmoc-Phe and diphenylalanine (Phe2) in the hydrogel network can provide the chelating moiety (through their nitrogen and oxygen atoms) for the Co(II) ions, resulting in stable Co(II) complexes [97]. Regarding the enhancing effect of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs nanoparticles, it is consistent with previous studies on magnetogels [98,99] and is related to the fact that NPs embedded in hydrogel can increase the cross-linking degree and porosity of the gel, providing a channel for the entry, exit, and adsorption of some substances [28]. More importantly, the interaction of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG with the external magnet further enhances the adsorption. As is well-known, magnetogels can exhibit an on/off effect on the hydrogel pores [27]. In fact, swelling or shrinking states of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG can be influenced by the magnetic dipole-dipole orientation of \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs toward the external magnetic field [100] and can increase the permeability of Co(II) into the hydrogel network for the chemisorption [89,101].\n2.6.2. Ni(II) Removal Studies\nNi(II)(aq) complexes display a typical octahedral structure with six water ligands in the first coordination shell [102] and an absorption maximum at 394 nm due to spinallowed transitions. Upon interaction, a decrease in the absorption band was observed without significant changes in the wavelength (see supporting information, Figure S5). The \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG dramatically enhances the adsorption of Ni(II), with and without an external magnet. All the three systems show very fast adsorptions in the early 30 min, and applying an external magnet results in reaching the equilibrium earlier, after around 150 min for \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG + magnet. Considering the effect of an external magnet on \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG adsorption ability, a plateau is reached after 150 min. Without applying the external magnet, the equilibrium is reached later (after 360 min) but with 10% higher adsorption capacity (Figure 8a). The adsorption efficiencies are summarized in Table 6, showing that the \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG and \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG + magnet systems can increase the removal efficiency by 7.3% and 5.1%, respectively, compared to the native hydrogel.\nGels 2023, 9, 621 15 of 24\nGels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 24 2.6.3. Cr(III) Removal Studies Cr(III) removal showed a different pattern, compared to Co(II) and Ni(II) adsorption. It is known that the aqueous Cr(III)(aq) can show three absorption peaks due to both the d\u2192d electronic transitions [103]. In the present study, the absorption peak of 420 nm was monitored and assigned to spin-allowed transition. The UV-Vis spectra (reported in the supporting information, Figure S6) show the decrease in the 420 nm absorption band due to the removal of Cr(III). As can be seen in Figure 8c, the adsorption rate of both magnetogels \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG with and without the applied magnet is higher than that of the hydrogel HG in the first half of the experiments. However, at equilibrium, all adsorbents reach almost similar values of removal capacity (Figure 8c) (120\u2013130 mg/g). Similar to the Co(II) and Ni(II) results, here also we clearly see the higher speed of magnetogels in removing the contaminant, further enhanced by the presence of a magnetic field. Table 8 reports the removal efficiencies for all the systems. Kinetic studies provided us further detailed information on Cr(III) removal. The fitting results of the kinetic models are given in Table 9. For the hydrogel, the correlation coefficient (R2) provided by the pseudo-first order model is much higher than that of the pseudo-second order, suggesting a physical mechanism for the adsorption of Cr(III) (Figure 8d). This can be explained by the electronic configuration of Cr(III) aqua complexes (d3), which are kinetically inert and have a low rate for the chemical substitution reaction in normal conditions. The physical mechanism might be due to the\nelectrostatic interaction of positively charged Cr(III) ions with the negatively charged\nhydrogel network [24,44]. Conversely, the data obtained with both magnetogels (with\nand without magnet) fit with a pseudo-second order model, suggesting that the presence\nof \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG and magnetic field can both change the hydrogel network and\nporosity, providing chelating conditions inside the hydrogel suitable for the formation of\nthe chemical bonds among hydrogel hyteroatoms and Cr(III) ions [104].\nFigure 8.

Also, the adsorption speed of magnetogels (with and without an external magnet) is higher than that of the native hydrogel. Applying the kinetics models for the Ni(II) removal, it can be seen (Figure 8b) that the pseudo-second order model was more consistent for all these three systems (all second-order coefficients R2 are higher than 0.97), supporting a chemisorption mechanism for Ni(II) (Table 7).\nGels 2023, 9, 621 16 of 24\n2.6.3.

In fact, the results achieved pointed out that the presence of \u03b3Fe2O3NPs provides magnetic properties to the resulting nanohybrids, which can be applied for magnetic-based removal applications of contaminants, such as heavy metal ions, from aqueous phases. The results of the removal studies demonstrate that the presence of \u03b3Fe2O3NPs in combination with the application of an external magnetic field increases the adsorption efficiency of the hydrogel matrix for all the metal ions tested in this study; in particular, the \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG + magnet was effective to absorb up to 2111 \u00b1 72 mg/g for Co(II), 1758 \u00b1 39 mg/g for Ni(II), and 142 \u00b1 5 mg/g for Cr(III). The kinetic models showed the chemisorption of these cations onto the \u03b3-Fe2O3NPs@HG (with and without the magnetic field). Regarding the native HG, Co(II) and Ni(II) showed chemisorption, but for the Cr(III), the results were fitted with a physical adsorption mechanism. This work showed that the peptide-based magnetogels can be introduced as promising adsorbing materials for wastewater treatment to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions. In the future, this study could be expanded to test the recovering ability of the three adsorbing systems for the recycling of metal ions, and extensive efforts should be directed to scale up the applications and test the developed materials in practical scenarios."
