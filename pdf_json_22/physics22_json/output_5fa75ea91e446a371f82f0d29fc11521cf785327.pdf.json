    "abstractText": "In this paper, we obtain analytical approximate black hole solutions in the framework of f (R) gravity and the absence of a cosmological constant. In this area, we apply the equations of motion of the theory to a spherically symmetric spacetime with one unknown function and derive black hole solutions without any constraints on the Ricci scalar. To do so, first, we obtain the near horizon and asymptotic solutions and then use both of them to obtain a complete solution by utilizing a continued-fraction expansion. Finally, we investigate the stability of the solutions by employing the thermodynamics and quasi-normal modes.",

            "text": "More than a century ago, Newtonian gravity failed to explain the anomalies in the orbits of Mercury. In 1915, Einstein introduced his theory of General Relativity (GR), which not only described the answer to the physics problems of that time, including the issue of Mercury but also its ability in its interesting predictions like the gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, black holes, etc. However, despite all of these successes, in recent years this theory, failed to be consistent with observation and was not able to describe the dark energy and dark matter that are confirmed by observations. Also, GR was not renormalizable and, therefore, could not be quantized by using the conventional methods in quantum field theory. It was shown that if one demands the renormalization to be satisfied at one-loop, the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action should be supplemented by higher-order curvature terms [1].\na e-mail: naseh.sajadi@gmail.com (corresponding author) b e-mail: hajilou@mi-ras.ru c e-mail: hendi@shirazu.ac.ir\nLater on, Einstein\u2019s theory of GR had many forms of modifications such as: f (R) gravity with R as the Ricci scalar [2\u20134], f (R, T ) gravity, where T is the trace of energy-momentum tensor [5,6], f (G) gravity with G the Gauss\u2013Bonnet invariant [7] etc. All of these modified theories have received much attention to investigating the accelerated expansion of our universe, flat rotation curves of galaxies, wormhole behavior [8\u201311]. One of the familiar extensions of GR is to include terms such as\nf (R) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03b22 R2 + \u03b21 R +R\u2212 +\u03b12R2+\u03b13R3+\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (1)\nwhere \u03b1i and \u03b2i are constants, and \u03b1i = \u03b2i = 0 corresponds to the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action. The special case \u03b12 = 0, \u03b1i = 0(i = 2), and \u03b2i = 0 is R2 gravity and known as the Starobinsky model [12]. In f (R) gravity, the interaction of spacetime and matter is different from GR. In GR, gravity appears as the curvature of spacetime, where the source of this curvature is all forms of matter. In the absence of any mass or energy, spacetime can become completely flat. What f (R) gravity does is allow spacetime to act as a source of its curvature so that there can still be some curvature even if spacetime is empty of matter. Therefore, as the universe expands and the matter density decreases, some curvature may remain that is capable of driving cosmic acceleration.\nMany applications have been developed in the framework of the f (R) gravity such as early-time inflation [12\u201314], cosmological phases [15\u201321], gravitational wave detection [22,23], the stability of the solutions [24\u201326] and other different issues [27]. Interestingly, the duality between gravity and quantum field theory that has been introduced in [28,29] and its applications considered in different theories and f (R) gravity such as [30\u201346]. In addition, the different solutions of f (R) gravity have been studied. Among these solutions, the\nauthors in [47] and [48] deduced the static spherically symmetric solutions by involving a perfect fluid. The black hole solution with/without electric charge is presented in [49]. Many analytic spherically symmetric solutions are derived in [51\u201353].\nIn this work, following the papers of quadratic [54] and cubic gravity [55], we concentrated on the analytic approximate black hole solutions of f (R) gravity using a continuedfraction expansion and their stability through Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) and thermodynamic.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, first, we give a brief review of f (R) gravity and apply the field equations of the theory to static-spherically symmetric spacetime. Then, to obtain the full black hole solution, we combine the asymptotic and near horizon solutions using a continued-fraction expansion. In Sect. 3, using the QNMs we study the dynamical stability of the black hole solutions. Finally, in Sect. 4 we give our concluding remarks."

(7)\nFor this model \u03b1 > 0 from the Dolgov and Kawasaki stability point of view [56]. We consider the following spherically symmetric and static line element for describing the geometry of spacetime\nds2 = \u2212h(r)dt2 + dr 2\nh(r) + r2\n( d\u03b82 + sin2(\u03b8)d\u03c62 ) . (8)\nAs we know, generic static, spherically, and symmetric metrics do not need to obey gtt grr = \u22121 necessarily, but field Eq. (7) admits solutions with this property [57,58], to which case we shall restrict our consideration here. By inserting the metric into the field equations (7), the differential equations for h(r) become\nErr = \u2212 30\u03b1r2hh\u2032\u2032 \u2212 24\u03b1rhh\u2032 + \u03b1r4h\u2032h\u2032\u2032\u2032 + 3\u03b1hr4h\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 + 10\u03b1r3hh\u2032\u2032\u2032 + 4\u03b1r2h\u2032\u2032 \u2212 18\u03b1r2h\u20322 + 28\u03b1rh\u2032 + 2r3h\u2032 + 2r2h \u2212 28\u03b1h + 36\u03b1h2 \u2212 8\u03b1 \u2212 2r2 = 0 . (9)\nWe would like to emphasize that, utilizing the other components of field equations gives the same result. Expanding the function h(r) around the event horizon r+ we obtain\nh(r) = h1(r \u2212 r+) + h2(r \u2212 r+)2 + h3(r \u2212 r+)3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (10)\nand then inserting these expressions into Eq. (9), we find\nh3 = \u2212\u22124\u03b1 + h1r 3+ + 4\u03b1r2+h2 \u2212 r2+ + 14\u03b1r+h1 \u2212 9\u03b1r2+h21\n3\u03b1r4+h1 ,\nh4 = 24\u03b1h1h2r 3+ \u2212 4h1r3+ + 80\u03b1r2+h21 \u2212 48\u03b1r3+h31 + 5r4+h21 \u2212 8\u03b1 + 4\u03b1r2+h2 \u2212 2r2+ + 24\u03b1r4+h21h2\n24\u03b1r6+h21\n+4\u03b1h 2 2 \u2212 h2\n24\u03b1r2+h21 , (11)\nwhere r+, h1 and h2 are undetermined constants of integration. The other near horizon constants are provided in the Appendix 1. In the large r limit, we linearize the field equations about the flat background\nh(r) \u2248 1 + H(r) , (12)\nwhere H(r) is to be determined by the field equations, and we linearize the differential equation by keeping terms only\nto order . The resulting differential equation for H(r) takes the form\nH \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 + 10 3r H \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 26 3r2 H \u2032\u2032 + 2(r 2 + 2\u03b1) 3\u03b1r3 H \u2032\n+2(r 2 + 22\u03b1) 3\u03b1r4\nH = 0 . (13) In the large r limit we obtain\nH \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032 + 10 3r H \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2212 26 3r2 H \u2032\u2032 + 2 3\u03b1r H \u2032 + 2 3\u03b1r2 H = 0 , (14)\nthat can be solved as H(r) = c1r4 0F2 (\n; 3, 25 6 ;\u2212 r 2 12\u03b1\n)\n+ c2r\u2212 73 0F2 (\n;\u221213 6 ,\u22121 6 ;\u2212 r\n2\n12\u03b1\n)\n+ c3r 1F3 (\n1;\u22121 2 , 2 3 , 8 3 ;\u2212 r\n2\n12\u03b1\n) , (15)\nhere, the pFq(a, b, z) is the generalized hypergeometric function [59,60]. For c1 = c2 = c3 = H1 and in the large r , H(r) becomes\nH(r) = H1 r \u2212 10\u03b1H1 r3 \u2212 210\u03b1 2H1 r5 \u2212 37800\u03b1 3H1 r7\n\u2212 20374200\u03b1 4H1 r9 \u2212 23837814000\u03b1 5H1 r11\n+ O ( 1\nr12\n) . (16)\nFinally, the solution is\nh(r) = 1 + H(r) . (17)\nWe wish to obtain an approximate analytic solution that is valid near the horizon and at large r . To reach this goal, we employ a continued-fraction expansion and write 1 [62\u201365]\nh(r) = x A(x), x = 1 \u2212 r+ r , (18)\nwith\nA(x) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x) + (a0 \u2212 )(1 \u2212 x)2\n+ a1(1 \u2212 x) 3\n1 + a2x 1 + a3x\n1 + a4x 1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n. (19)\n1 It should be noted that the other components of field equations give the same result for the Eqs. (10)\u2013(17).\nEven at lowest order, the continued fraction approximation does a good job of approximating the solution everywhere outside the horizon. This only gets better as more terms are included. Here, we truncated the continued-fraction expansion at order 4. This method give an accurate analytic expression approximating for the metric for the whole space outside the event horizon, and not only near the black hole or far from it (r+ \u2264 r < \u221e). By expanding (18) near the horizon (x \u2192 0) and the asymptotic region (x \u2192 1) we obtain\n= \u2212H1 r+ \u2212 1, a0 = 0, a1 = \u22121 \u2212 a0 + 2 + r+h1 , (20)\nfor the lowest order expansion coefficients, with the remaining ai given in terms of (r+, h1, h2). Also, we provided these expressions in the Appendix 1.\nThe result is an approximate analytic solution for metric functions everywhere outside the horizon. For a static space time we have a timelike Killing vector \u03be = \u2202t everywhere outside the horizon. Therefore, one can obtain\nT = h \u2032 (r)\n4\u03c0 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r+ = h1 4\u03c0 = (1 \u2212 2 + a1 + a0) 4\u03c0r+ . (21)\nWe computed the entropy as follows [71,72]\nS = A 4 fR = A 4\n[ 1 \u2212 2\u03b1\nr2\n( h\u2032\u2032r2 + 4rh\u2032 \u2212 2 + 2h )] r=r+\n= \u03c0r2+ [\n1 \u2212 2\u03b1 r2+\n( h2r 2+ + 4r+h1 \u2212 2 )] . (22)\nWe now consider the thermodynamics of these black hole solutions, whose basic equations are the first law and Smarr formula\ndM = TdS , (23) M = 2T S , (24)\nwhere there are no pressure/volume terms since we have set = 0. From Eq. (24) we have\nM = h1(r+) 2\n( r2+ \u2212 2\u03b1r2+h2(r+) \u2212 8\u03b1r+h1(r+) + 4\u03b1 ) ,\n(25)\nyielding the mass parameter as a function of the horizon radius. Regarding the asymptotic flat spacetimes, we can define the total mass at spatial infinity as the ArnowittDeser-Misner (ADM) mass. Besides, the Komar mass makes sense for calculating total mass of a black hole solutions enjoying a timelike Killing vector. In addition to these two\napproaches, one can use alternative methods like MisnerSharp prescription. Although the Misner-Sharp mass is just the Schwarzschild-like mass in the Schwarzschild space, it can be extended to 4-dimensional f(R) gravity (see for example: [66\u201368] for higher dimensions). In the Appendix 1, we showed that the asymptotic behavior of the mass (25) is the same as the mass of the Schwarzschild black hole. Therefore, one can interpret the mass (25) as ADM mass. We now impose the first law (23), which becomes\n\u2202M \u2202r+ \u2212 T \u2202S \u2202r+ = 0 , (26)\nwhere differential equation that must be satisfied by h1(r+) and h2(r+). Therefore, we achieve the prominent equation as follows\nR[r2+ \u2212 2r2+\u03b1h2(r+) \u2212 12\u03b1r+h1(r+) + 4\u03b1]h\u20321(r+) \u2212 h1(r+)[4\u03b1h1(r+) \u2212 r+ + 2\u03b1r+h2(r+) + \u03b1r2+h\u20322(r+)] = 0 . (27)\nIn order to solve the differential Eq. (27), we need to define h2. To do so, we assume h2 = g(\u03b1). Recall that, near the horizon, the metric function is expanded as h(r) = h1(r\u2212r+)+h2(r\u2212r+)2+ \u2211 hi (h2)(r\u2212r+)i , (28)\nwhere the constants with i > 2 are determined by the field equations in terms of other parameters. We will demand that this expansion has a smooth \u03b1 \u2192 0 limit. Therefore, the expansions for the first four terms are\nh3(h2) = \u2212r+h1 \u2212 1 3h1r2+\u03b1\n\u2212 14h1r+ \u2212 9h 2 1r 2+ \u2212 4 + 4r2+g(0) 3h1r4+\n+ O(\u03b1), (29)\nh4(h2) = 5r4+h21 \u2212 2r2+ \u2212 4r3+h1 \u2212 r4+g(0)\n24h21r 6+\u03b1\n+ 4r 4+g(0)2 \u2212 48h31r3+ + 4r2+g(0)\n24h21r 6+\n+ 24r 4+h21g(0) + 24r3+h1g(0) \u2212 r4+g\u2032(0) + 80h21r2+ \u2212 8\n24h21r 6+\n+ O(\u03b1) , (30) h5(h2) = h1r+ \u2212 1\n210h31r 4+\u03b12\n+ 100h 2 1r 2+ \u2212 12 \u2212 3h21r4+g(0) + 5r4+g(0)2 + 2r3+h1g(0) 420h31r 6+\u03b1 + 28r 2+g(0) + 80r0h1 \u2212 146h31r3+\n420h31r 6+\u03b1\n+ O(\u03b1) , (31)\nh6(h2) = \u221290r 7+g(0)h1 \u2212 24h1r5+ \u2212 97r6+g(0) \u2212 106r4+ + 165r6+h21 \u2212 42r7+h31\n25200h41r 10+ \u03b12\n\u2212 120g(0) 3r8+ \u2212 97r6+g\u2032(0) \u2212 72g(0)2r8+h21 + 90r7+g\u2032(0)h1 + 1976r3+h1\n25200r10+ h41\u03b1\n+ 4200r 4+h21 + 6420h31r5+ + 60r7+h31g(0) + 3692r5+h1g(0) + 216g(0)r4+\n25200r10+ h41\u03b1\n+ 1084r 6+g(0)2 \u2212 832r2+ \u2212 9882r6+h41 \u2212 1374r6+g(0)h21 \u2212 180h1r7+g(0)2\n25200r10+ h41\u03b1 + O(\u03b10) . (32)\nDemanding h3 to have a smooth behavior at \u03b1 \u2192 0 limit, we must take\nh1 = 1 r+ . (33)\nThen, for h4 we have\ng(0) = \u2212 1 r2+ . (34)\nNow, by inserting (33) and (34) into the h5 and h6, one can find h5 = 0 and g\u2032 = 0. By continuing the procedure in this way, one can find that the other coefficients of expansion should be zero.\ng\u2032\u2032(0) = g\u2032\u2032\u2032(0) = g\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032(0) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = 0 . (35)\nTherefore, h2 can be obtained as\nh2 = g(0) + g\u2032\u03b1 + g\u2032\u2032\u03b12 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = \u2212 1 r2+ . (36)\nBy inserting h2 into the Eq. (27), one can obtain a differential equation only for h1. By solving it we obtained three solutions for h1\nh(1)1 = B\n1 3\n24\u03b1r+ + (r 2+ + 6\u03b1)2 24\u03b1r+B 1 3 + r 2+ + 6\u03b1 24\u03b1r+ , (37)\nh(2)1 = \u2212 B\n1 3\n48\u03b1r+ \u2212 (r 2+ + 6\u03b1)2 48\u03b1r+B 1 3 + r 2+ + 6\u03b1 24\u03b1r+\n\u2212 i \u221a 3\n2\n( B 1 3\n24\u03b1r+ \u2212 (r 2+ + 6\u03b1)2 24\u03b1r+B 1 3\n) , (38)\nh(3)1 = \u2212 B\n1 3\n48\u03b1r+ \u2212 (r 2+ + 6\u03b1)2 48\u03b1r+B 1 3 + r 2+ + 6\u03b1 24\u03b1r+\n+ i \u221a 3\n2\n( B 1 3\n24\u03b1r+ \u2212 (r 2+ + 6\u03b1)2 24\u03b1r+B 1 3\n) , (39)\nwhere\nA = c1(216\u03b13 + 1728c1\u03b12r2+ + r6+ + 18\u03b1r4+ + 108\u03b12r2+) (40)\nB = 3456c1\u03b12r2+ + r6+ + 18\u03b1r4+ + 108\u03b12r2+ + 216\u03b13 + 48\u03b1r+ \u221a 3A. (41)\nFor \u03b1 > 0 and c1 > 0 we have just one real solution and also for \u03b1 > 0 and c1 \u2264 0 we have three real solutions. Inserting (37)-(41) into the thermodynamical quantities and plotting them, one can obtain Fig. 1. In this figure, we have illustrated the temperature, mass, and entropy for different values of parameters in the left, middle, and right panels, respectively. As can be seen, there are two kinds of solutions with four branches in such a way that the black dashed lines are the Schwarzschild-like solution and the solid lines non-Schwarzschild-like solution. The black solid line is a non-physical black hole solution due to having a negative temperatures and mass. In Fig. 2 we have shown the behavior of heat capacity and free energy in the left and right panels, respectively. As can be seen, the heat capacity is negative for all values of r+ which shows the black holes locally are unstable. The free energy for a non-Schwarzschild-like solution is decreasing function which shows the solutions globally are stable.\nIn Fig. 3 we present the solutions for h(r) with different values of horizons in the left, middle, and right panels that depicting the full continued-fraction solution (18) along with its comparison to the near-horizon solution with blue dashed lines and large-r series expansions solution with black dashed lines. We see that the continued-fraction expansion converges to both of these two approximations. Similar to quadratic gravity, we find two groups of solutions [54,69,70]. For the first group, the metric function is increasing functions in r \u2265 r+. These solutions are generalizations of the Schwarzschild black hole solution and reduce to the Schwarzschild as \u03b1 \u2192 0. The non-Schwarzschild solutions are physically distinct from the first group, and as \u03b1 \u2192 0, it does not go back to the Schwarzschild metric.\nHere, we would like to solve the field equation (8) and the metric near the center of a black hole. Therefore, we consider\nthe following expansion around the origin as h(r) = \u2211 i=0 cir i . (42)\nSimilar to previous cases for near horizons and asymptotes, one can obtain the metric as\nh(r) = c0 + c0r 2\n4\u03b1(9c0 + 1) + 3(3c0 + 1)c 2 0r 4\n8\u03b12(9c0 + 1)2(27c20 \u2212 40c0 \u2212 2)\n+ 15c 3 0(9c 2 0 \u2212 3c0 \u2212 2)r6\n64\u03b13(159c30 + 36c0 + 1)(9c0 + 1)3(27c20 \u2212 40c0 \u2212 2) + O(r8) , (43)\nwith c0 = 1 and c0 = \u22122/9. The metric is fully determined and there is no free parameter. The Kretschmann scalar and Ricci scalars near the origin behaves as\nK = Rabcd Rabcd = 4(c0 \u2212 1) 2 r4 + 2c0(c0 \u2212 1) \u03b1(9c0 + 1)r2\n+ 3c 2 0(33c 2 0 \u2212 44c0 \u2212 4)\n2\u03b12(9c0 + 1)2(27c20 \u2212 40c0 \u2212 2) + O(r2) , (44)\nR = 2(1 \u2212 c0) r2 \u2212 2 3\u03b1\n+ O(r2) . (45) As can be seen, for the case c0 = 1, the behavior of the metric near the origin corresponds to an Anti-de Sitter space-time and the Kretschmann and Ricci scalar have a finite values (K = 3/200\u03b12, R = \u22122/3\u03b1) (with a nonzero mass). Regular solutions with an Anti-de Sitter core have been studied with a nonlinear electromagnetic source in [73]. But, for the case c0 = \u22122/9, the Kretschmann and Ricci scalar do not become zero and there is a singularity. In Fig. 4, we have shown the full solutions of the field equations from center to infinity by starting from the near origin metric (43) and asymptotic solution (17), for c0 = 1 (a solution without horizon2) and for c0 = \u22122/9 (black hole case)."

To do so, we used the Klein\u2013Gordon equation for the massless real scalar probe \u03c6(r) as follows\n\u03c6(r) = 0 . (46) 2 This solution is not a naked solution because the Kretschmann and Ricci scalar do not diverge.\nFig. 2 The behavior of heat capacity (left) and free energy (right) in terms of r+ for \u03b1 = 0.5, c1 = \u22120.1406\nIt is important to note that, since we assume that the metric (8) is the vacuum solution of the field Eq. (9) and also the perturbation of the scalar field is second order then can not contribute at the linear perturbation to the field equation [74,75].

(49)\nNow, in order to solve the differential equation (47) with the conditions (49), we used the Mashhoon\u2019s Method [76,77].

First, from the figures and the tables, one can conclude that the quasinormal frequencies have a positive imaginary part, which shows that both the Schwarzschild and non-Schwarzschild black holes are stable under the scalar perturbations. Second, it is observed for both black holes, with increasing j , the values of the real part of the frequencies increase while the imaginary part of the frequencies decreases, which is a sign of more stability of black holes.

            "text": "Here, we compute the Misner-Sharp mass with equation (4.16) of [66] as follows:\nE = r 2G\n[ (1 \u2212 hab\u2202ar\u2202br) fR + r 2\n6 ( f \u2212 R fR)\n] , (55)\nwhere xa is the coordinate on a two-dimensional spacetime witha = t, r . By inserting metric (8) into the above definition for mass and using (6), one can get\nE = r 2 (1 \u2212 h) + \u03b1 12r [12hh\u2032\u2032\u2032r3 \u2212 8r2h\u2032\u2032(1 \u2212 7h + rh\u2032)\n\u2212 16r2h\u20322 + 8rh\u2032(h \u2212 4) \u2212 r4h\u2032\u20322 + 4(1 \u2212 h)(7h + 5)]. (56)\nUsing the asymptotic metric (17), one can get\nE = \u2212H1 2 + 5\u03b1H1 r2\n+ \u03b12 [\n100H1 r4 + 80H 2 1 r5\n]\n+O(\u03b13) (57) If we assume H1 = \u22122M , the total energy of black hole becomes\nE = M \u2212 10\u03b1M r2\n\u2212 \u03b12 [ 200M\nr4 \u2212 320M\n2\nr5\n]\n+O(\u03b13), (58) which is the same as ADM mass.\nWhile the mass (25) in the case of small \u03b1 1 becomes\nM \u223c i\u221ac1r+ + 8c1 + 3i \u221a c1\nr+ \u03b1 + O(\u03b12),\n\u223c \u2212i\u221ac1r+ + 8c1 \u2212 3i \u221a c1\nr+ \u03b1 + O(\u03b12),\n\u223c \u221216c1 r+ \u03b1 + 96c1\u03b1 2 r3+ + O(\u03b13), (59)\nfor three solutions of h1 in Eqs. (36)\u2013(41). It is straightforward to show that for c1 = \u22121/4, the asymptotic value of the mass (59) is the same as Schwarzschild mass."
