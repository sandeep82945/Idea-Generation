    "abstractText": "Literature suggests that anxiety affects gait and balance among young adults. However, previous studies using machine learning (ML) have only used gait to identify individuals who report feeling anxious. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify individuals who report feeling anxious at that time using a combination of gait and quiet balance ML. Using a cross-sectional design, participants (n = 88) completed the Profile of Mood Survey-Short Form (POMS-SF) to measure current feelings of anxiety and were then asked to complete a modified Clinical Test for Sensory Interaction in Balance (mCTSIB) and a two-minute walk around a 6 m track while wearing nine APDM mobility sensors. Results from our study finds that Random Forest classifiers had the highest median accuracy rate (75%) and the five top features for identifying anxious individuals were all gait parameters (turn angles, variance in neck, lumbar rotation, lumbar movement in the sagittal plane, and arm movement). Post-hoc analyses suggest that individuals who reported feeling anxious also walked using gait patterns most similar to older individuals who are fearful of falling. Additionally, we find that individuals who are anxious also had less postural stability when they had visual input; however, these individuals had less movement during postural sway when visual input was removed.",

            "text": "Mental health is a global problem, and the prevalence of anxiety ranged anywhere from 2.4% to 29.8% globally in 2013 [1]. However, since the start of the global pandemic,\nSensors 2022, 22, 3163. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093163 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nthese numbers have increased by approximately 25.6% [2]. While we are unaware of the global toll of the pandemic on feelings of anxiety in otherwise healthy individuals, a recent study by Twenge and Joiner (2020) reported that US adults are more than three times as likely to report being anxious in 2020 than they were in 2019 [3]. In 2010, anxiety was the sixth leading cause of disability globally, with annual costs of anxiety-related disability ranging from $42 billion to $53 billion [4]. While anxiety disorders have a significant societal burden, individuals without a diagnosis of anxiety disorder may also report an increase in feelings of anxiety as a normal response to worry from a perceived stressful event [5]. Feelings of anxiety are usually self-reported, which can be influenced by an individual\u2019s culture [1] and gender [6] differences. While there are significant advantages to using self-reported measures for anxiety, such as their high correlation with complementary objective measures, there is a risk of social and cognitive biases [7]. These biases are especially more pronounced in studies assessing mental health because of the stigma surrounding the issue. For example, Bird and Reiker [6] report that women are more comfortable expressing emotions than men, which may partially explain the high prevalence of anxiety in women compared to men [8]. Additionally, a systematic review and meta-regression by Baxter and colleagues [1] suggest that there are cultural differences in self-reported feelings of anxiety. Taken together, these findings suggest that researchers explore objective direct and indirect measures, such as biomarkers and walking gait or balance, which may be impacted by feelings of anxiety. While significant evidence has identified objective biomarkers associated with anxiety [9], these biomarkers are individualized, which makes identifying individuals who report anxiety through biomarkers challenging, as reported by the null findings of Boeke and colleagues [10]. However, utilizing a person\u2019s gait is one area where researchers have successfully identified feelings of anxiety through objective measures. For example, Zhao and colleagues reported a 74% accuracy rate in identifying feelings of anxiety using a walking gait [11], while Miao and colleagues [12] reported a 78.4% accuracy rate in identifying individuals who reported feeling anxious. These findings are promising because they suggest that gait may be a valid objective indirect measure to identify feelings of anxiety. Zhao and colleagues [11] used the X-Box Kinect to capture gait data; however, they did not report gait features that were most important to identifying individuals who reported feelings of anxiety. Conversely, Miao and colleagues [12] utilized a digital camera and reported capturing features such as nose and ear movement, data that are not typically reported in the gait literature. Miao and colleagues\u2019 [12] significant findings included associations between anxiety and joint movements of the elbow, knee, hip, and wrist, information that is also not usually reported in gait literature. The authors deliberately chose to not calculate the gait measures most commonly reported in the literature, such as stride length, walking speed, or arm swing, because they felt that time-domain data were better for predicting anxiety than traditional biomechanical variables [12]. These findings provide limited interpretability for researchers seeking to replicate these findings using traditionally measured gait characteristics. Additionally, although X-Box Kinect data are highly reliable, it produces a copious amount of data, which makes analyses more cumbersome, and may be impractical in many situations. Conversely, Inertial Movement Unit (IMU) sensors, such as the ones used in this study (APDM, Portland, OR, USA), may offer less data-intensive ways of capturing kinematic gait data. Therefore, this study aims to use the most commonly reported kinematic gait variables captured by IMU sensors to predict feelings of anxiety. Although Zhao and colleagues [11] and Miao and colleagues [12] did not report the gait variables most commonly reported in the literature, other studies [13\u201318] suggest that there is a strong association between commonly measured gait characteristics and anxiety. For example, Feldman and colleagues [13] identified slower walking gait speed, shorter step length, and fewer steps per minute among adults who reported anxiety compared to those who did not. However, Feldman and colleagues [13] compared individuals who reported a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder compared to those who did not. These\nfindings [13] have limited applicability to healthy individuals who may report feeling anxious without a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Conversely, multiple studies that examined anxiety at the moment have reported changes in both gait and balance measures among healthy young and older adults [14\u201319]. This body of literature has reported a decrease in gait velocity with increased fear of falling [14,16,17] and differences in gait strategies when young and older adults are asked to walk under threatening or anxiety-inducing conditions [16,19]. Additionally, researchers also report that feelings of anxiety at the moment also significantly impair balance performance in healthy populations [18,19]. Taken together, we may surmise that when using traditional gait and balance measures, healthy individuals who report feeling anxious may report a slower walking gait [14,16,17] and balance dysfunction [18\u201320] compared to individuals who do not report feeling anxious. Although there are no definitive mechanisms that link gait, balance, and feelings of anxiety, based on previously published studies, we may hypothesize a biological link exists between feelings of anxiety, gait, and balance control. Individuals who are fearful of falling utilize strategies where they rely on the spinal reflex pathway that allows for faster processing of information [21]. Further, evidence suggests that anxiety influences oculomotor and gaze control [22], which may alter locomotion in individuals who are anxious [16]. Other data suggest that individuals who report being anxious have lower attentional control but higher attentional demands for locomotion [23,24]. When examining balance control, we find that individuals who report feeling anxious have decreased visual processing [25] and increased physiological arousal, which results in a reduced center of pressure displacement and increased leg muscle activity [26\u201328]. Taken together, these findings [16,21\u201328], and the findings of studies that have measured changes in gait and balance due to increased feelings of anxiety [14\u201319], suggest that our study may be able to identify individuals who report being anxious using a combination of gait and balance parameters. Currently, we are aware of two studies [11,12] that have successfully identified individuals who report feeling anxious from individuals who do not report feeling anxious using a walking gait. However, these studies identified gait characteristics not normally reported in the gait literature (i.e., ear movement, nose movement, and movement in the left ankle), limiting the interpretability by researchers interested in understanding traditional gait parameters needed to most accurately identify individuals who report being anxious. Therefore, to add to the existing literature, our exploratory study aims are the following: (1) identify variables most important for machine learning algorithms to utilize to identify individuals who report feeling anxious; (2) determine the accuracy of machine learning algorithms that use clinical variables to identify individuals who report feeling anxious compared to those who do not; (3) identify differences in the various clinical measures of gait and balance between individuals who report feelings of anxiety compared to those who do not."

            "text": "2.3.1. Self-Reported Feelings of Anxiety\nThe 30-item Profile of Mood States-Short Form (POMS-SF) [29] was used to assess current feelings of anxiety. Participants reported their current intensity of subjective mood states on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \u201cNot at all\u201d (scored as 0) to \u201cExtremely\u201d (scored as 4). Feelings of anxiety were calculated using a combination of five questions (Tense + Shaky + Nervous + Anxious + Uneasy). The Cronbach\u2019s alpha for current feelings of anxiety was 0.839.\n2.3.2. Gait\nUsing methodology from previous literature that used machine learning to identify moods and emotions using walking gait, this study used a 6 m \u00d7 1 m track where participants were asked to walk back and forth for two minutes at their own pace [11,30]. However, unlike previous studies that utilized the X-Box Kinect, this study utilized APDM mobility LabTM (APDM Inc, Portland, OR, USA) as they have been proven to be valid and reliable forms of gait measurements using similar protocols [31,32]. The APDM mobility LabTM sensors are a set of wireless, OpalTM inertial sensors, each with a docking station that has an access point for wireless data transmission and sub-millisecond synchronization of the independent sensors. The OpalTM inertial sensors have a range of 6 m and contain tri-axial accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. The accelerometers measure linear acceleration, gyroscopes measure angular velocity, and the magnetometers measure heading with respect to the earth\u2019s magnetic field. In this study, we used seven OpalsTM that were attached to the body using VelcroTM straps [32]. The OpalsTM were placed at the following locations: lumbar region (5th lumbar vertebra), sternum (body of the sternum immediately superior to the xyphoid process), forehead (middle of the frontal bone, approximately 2.5 cm above the nasal bone), right and left foot (on the metatarsals, directly superior to the metatarsophalangeal joint), and the right and left wrist (immediately superior to the radioulnar joint) [31,33]. These locations were used because they also allowed the researchers to measure anticipatory postural adjustments prior to gait initiation [33].\n2.3.3. Balance\nPrevious literature that has examined state anxiety and balance has utilized either force plates [19] or the Neurocom Balance Master to perform the Sensory Organizational Test (SOT) [20]. These authors chose to use the modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance (mCTSIB) to measure balance using the OpalTM monitors as mCTSIB measures have been shown to be highly correlated with scores on the SOT [34]. The mCTSIB is a clinically relevant measure of balance that can be completed using the OpalTM monitors [35,36]. During the performance of this test, participants were asked to stand quietly for 30 s with feet spaced apart by the APDM footplate (a clear trapezoidal plate) and hands were placed on the hips. Balance was tested under the following 4 discrete conditions: A) Eyes open (EO) firm surface, B) Eyes closed (EC) firm surface, C) EO foam surface (Airex Balance Pad Foam Balance Board Stability Cushion, 50.5 cm W \u00d7 40.1 cm D \u00d7 6.0 cm H), and D) EC foam surface [35,36].\n2.3.4. Procedure\nAfter screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria participants were scheduled for one, 75 min long session. Participants were asked to refrain from consuming alcohol, caffeine, medications, and illicit drugs at least 24 h prior to testing. Participants were invited to the lab where they completed a series of surveys on Surveymonkey.com (San Mateo, CA, USA) to determine if they had followed pre-testing instructions. Participants who reported consuming alcohol caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs in the past 24 h were re-scheduled.\nThose who were eligible to complete the study were assigned a random 5-digit ID using randomizer.org and fitted for the APDM mobility monitors.

Participants also completed these pretesting surveys using Surveymonkey.com using a Hewlett Packard Pavilion 15.6\u201d Flagship Laptop (model # B018YIGHVK, Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The entire pretesting procedure lasted approximately 10 min. After completion of the pre-test questions, participants completed the mCTSIB (approximately 2.5 min) and the two-minute walk. The mCTSIB was performed at the edge of the walking track and the two-minute walk was started immediately following the performance of the mCTSIB. Subsequently, participants\u2019 height was measured using a stadiometer (SECA model 220 Crothal Healthcare, Chino, CA, USA) and their weight was measured using the Tanita Body Composition Analyzer TBF-410 (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Participants were then asked to complete a series of surveys that asked them about health-related lifestyle factors such as diet, sleep quality, physical activity levels, and trait energy and fatigue, which are not reported in this study."

            "text": "Pre-Processing of Data\nData from SurveyMonkey.com were downloaded and exported into Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) where mood data were scored. Gait and balance data were exported as h5 files into Python (version 3.7, Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA), where balance and gait characteristics for each participant were calculated. For gait measures, we calculated mean measures for each gait parameter, variation in each gait parameter by calculating standard deviation in the movement over 2 min (referred to as variation in this study). For upper and lower-extremity movement, means were calculated for each limb and means were also calculated for both limbs, further variations in inter- and intra-limb movements were also calculated. The following formulas were used:\nMean for each gait parameter (i.e., turn velocity):\n(mean turn velocity = sum o f velocity o f all turns\nnumber o f turns )\nVariation for each gait parameter (i.e., standard deviation in turn velocity):\n(variation in turn velocity = \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u2211i=number o f turnsi=1 (turn velocity \u2212 mean turn velocity)2 Number o f turns )\nMean gait parameter for individual limb (i.e., mean gait speed for right leg only):\n(mean gait speed right leg = sum o f gait speed o f right leg during 2 \u2212 minute walk number o f steps taken by right leg in 2 \u2212 minute walk )\nVariation in movement for each individual limb (i.e., standard deviation for right leg gait speed only/intra-limb variation in movement):\n(variation in right leg gait speed = \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u2211i=number o f steps on right legi=1 (right leg gait speed \u2212 mean right leg gait speed)2 Number o f steps on right leg\nMean gait parameter for both limbs of upper and lower extremity (i.e., mean gait speed):\nMean gait speed = \u2211 (gait speed right leg + gait speed le f t leg)\nTotal number o f steps\nImbalance in gait parameters between limbs (i.e., variation in gait speed between limbs/inter-limb variation in movement) to assess for consistency of movement and synchronization of movement on both sides [37,38].\nImbalance in gait speed between limb = \u2211 gait speed right leg\u2212gait speed le f t leggait speed right leg+gait speed le f t leg /Total number o f steps\nMood scores were then uploaded into Python (version 3.8.5, Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA) and merged with gait and balance data. Records were deleted if they were not collected properly or had features with missing values greater than 5%. Data were then visualized in Python. Anxiety scores were split into statistical quartiles based on frequency of distribution. The quartiles included POMS-SF Anxiety scores = 0, POMS-SF Anxiety scores = 1, POMS-SF Anxiety scores = 2, and POMS-SF Anxiety scores \u2265 3. For the purposes of this exploratory study, the researchers were only interested in determining whether the models could classify individuals on the extreme ends. Therefore, this study only included individuals who reported a POMS-SF Anxiety scores = 0 and those who reported scores \u2265 3 in the final analysis. Therefore, the researchers grouped participants by those who reported scores of \u22653 on the POMS-SF anxiety (Anxious) and those who reported POMS-SF anxiety score of 0 (Not Anxious). Individuals who reported a score of 1 or 2 were not included in our final analysis. After pre-processing data, we had data for 88 participants with 190 gait characteristics, and 30 features for each of the four balance conditions (i.e., 120 total features for balance) used in the analyses. The researchers then filled in missing values through the mean value of that feature in the dataset [35]. Chi-square goodness of fit was used to determine sex differences and independent sample t-tests were used to determine differences in age, height, and weight between the two groups."

The researchers classified the records who reported scores \u2265 3 on the anxiety portion of the POMS-SF as Anxious and those who scored a 0 as Not Anxious. The researchers used all features and top five features (using 0.024 as a cut-off for feature importance) to train each model. The researchers trained the models in a 10-fold cross-validation manner to avoid problems such as overfitting or selection bias to some degree [40]. The data were randomly split into the training set (90%) and test set (10% and ran each of the ML models 10,000 times using a Monte Carlo method [41\u201343].

Lower Extremity Characteristics\nNone of the lower extremity features were in the top five; however, many of the features out of the top five were significantly different. Those who reported feeling anxious also had a significantly lower variance for gait speed between limbs (0.91% \u00b1 0.80 vs. 1.23% \u00b1 0.73), less step variability between legs (8.16% \u00b1 5.85 vs. 11.21% \u00b1 7.44), and less variance in mid-swing elevation between legs (13.88% \u00b1 11.97 vs. 18.8% \u00b1 13.94), and less time spent in single leg support (39.59 s \u00b1 1.50 vs. 40.10 s \u00b1 1.45). Self-reported feelings of anxiety also increased variance in double leg support time (0.84 \u00b1 0.33 vs. 0.76 \u00b1 0.15), greater variance in toe-out angle between legs (2.78% \u00b1 1.97 vs 2.21% \u00b1 1.70), and increased time spent in double leg support time (10.58 s\u00b1 1.34 vs 10.01 s \u00b1 1.41).\n3.3.5. Turning Features\nOf the top five features in our model, those who reported feeling anxious took significantly wider turns (188.30\u25e6 \u00b1 4.17) compared to those who were not anxious (185.87\u25e6 \u00b1 3.43).

Although significant evidence indicates that there are differences in gait [14\u201319] and balance [18,19] among individuals who report feeling anxious compared to those who do not, the findings of this study suggest that gait may be the most important feature to consider when using sensors to identify individuals who are anxious in the moment."

When examining the literature, findings report that older adults usually adjust their turns [44], as turning requires maintaining balance [45] when they report feeling anxious. These findings are similar to the findings of this study, as young adults who reported feeling anxious in this study made wider turns compared to those who were not anxious. This finding is unique in that the previous literature that has used machine learning in walking gait to identify feelings of anxiety has used variations in movements (i.e., nose and ear movement, ankle movement) [11,12], whereas this study provides the gait characteristics most commonly used in the literature."

            "text": "The median of the best model had a 75% accuracy, which is congruent with previously reported literature [11,12]. However, the findings of this study add the following three unique aspects to the literature: (1) This study used sensors, which are significantly less data-intensive than the X-Box Kinect; (2) this study was able to identify individuals who reported feeling anxious in the present, while previous literature identified individuals who reported feeling anxious at any point over the last two weeks; (3) this study used measures most often reported in gait literature to identify feelings of anxiety, while the previous literature that reported variables not often reported (i.e., nose and ear movement).\n4.3. Objective 3 4.3.1. Gait\nOverall, our findings suggest that individuals who report feeling anxious had no trouble initiating gait; however, based on the variables that were significantly different, these individuals had more cautious gait patterns. The gait patterns found in the anxious young adults in our study are similar to those observed in older adults who are fearful of falling [14]. Individuals who self-report being anxious show a significantly greater side-to-side rotation of the neck, but less up-and-down movement. These findings may be explained by the fact that anxiety has an effect on oculomotor and gaze control [22], which has been linked to alterations in locomotion [16]. The findings of this study suggest a reduced smoothness of neck movement among individuals who report feeling anxious,\nwhich may be explained by previous hypotheses that suggest that individuals who report feeling anxious are consistently performing threat assessments during locomotion [16]. When examining movements of the trunk and lumbar spine, our results found that anxious individuals had an increased forward/backward and side-to-side movement as they walked compared to individuals who did not report feeling anxious. These findings also report that anxious individuals had a significantly greater bending to the left side when compared to healthy individuals, but not on the right side. Our findings may be explained by the fact that, in this study, participants were asked to walk around an oval track making left turns only. The increased bending to the left by anxious individuals suggests that these individuals were trying to create a base of support when turning. While this study reports increased variations in lumbar movements, the results also found decreased variance in thoracic movements. Taken together, this suggests that individuals who are anxious may be trying to use the spinal reflex pathway (automatic control strategy) to control locomotion rather than send information to the higher centers (executive strategy). Utilizing this strategy allows for faster unconscious correction of the trunk (i.e., fast, parallel processing of information) and is utilized by individuals who are fearful of falling [21]. The lower extremity movements of anxious young adults are also similar to those of older adults who are fearful of falling [46]. For example, this study reports that there were fewer variations in the lower extremity movements among anxious individuals and that anxious individuals also spent more time in double leg support time, thus less time in single leg support time when compared to their counterparts who reported not feeling anxious. The lower extremity movements further reinforce the findings presented for trunk and lumbar movements because they suggest a lower attentional control, but higher attentional demands for locomotion [23] among anxious individuals. Previously, a meta-analysis reported a significant negative relationship between anxiety and attentional control [24], which the authors believe may have impacted the walking gait of anxious individuals in this study. Based on the movement of the neck (increased visual scanning), trunk, and lumbar regions (decreased trunk movement), the authors hypothesize that anxious individuals may be scanning for threats by minimizing attentional control of locomotion. Another potential hypothesis to explain walking gait differences may be that anxious individuals may also have balance deficiencies in walking gait. This hypothesis is supported by the findings in this study that show participants who reported feeling anxious had a decreased stride velocity and spent more time in double leg support, yet they had a greater variance in double leg support time, which suggests that they were trying to unsuccessfully regulate and slow gait speed over the course of the two minutes to maintain balance. This hypothesis is further supported by anxious individuals\u2019 having an increased variance in toe-out angle and mid-swing elevation, which suggests that these individuals were trying to correct for information received by their balance system [47,48]. Additionally, this hypothesis is further supported when examining how anxious individuals turn. In these data, the authors report that anxious individuals take wider, more variable, yet faster turns. Taken together, this suggests that anxious individuals may be trying to find a larger base of support when turning (wider turns), while decreasing the amount of time spent in unstable environments (faster turns, as turns, are less stable than straight walking). These findings are similar to those reported among individuals with gait disorders who try to avoid falling [49], as well as individuals who report feeling low energy [50,51]. A visual representation of the gait differences can be found at https://gaitsim.dmanserver.com/ AnxietyYN (accessed on 12 January 2022).\n4.3.2. Balance\nAlthough none of the balance-associated variables were predictive of feelings of anxiety in the machine learning model presented in this study, it was found that anxious individuals had different balance corrections and errors compared to those who did not feel anxious. This study reported that anxious individuals had greater front-to-back (sagittal plane) movement; however, they had less side-to-side movement when their eyes were\nopen and their feet were on a firm surface. The authors also found that anxious individuals correct significantly faster front-to-back but slower side-to-side compared to non-anxious individuals. Interestingly, when examining the balance condition where somatosensory input is unreliable but visual input is present, postural sway is \u201csmoother\u201d with less spatial displacement and slower temporal adjustments, except when correcting side-to-side. The authors also found that when vision was occluded on both firm surface and foam surface conditions, individuals who reported being anxious had a \u201csmoother\u201d balance with less spatial displacement and slower temporal corrections. Taken together, these findings suggest that visual input is impacted by feelings of anxiety [25], as shown by quicker temporal corrections in both vision conditions, albeit in different planes. The balance findings from this study further support the hypothesis put forth by the authors when explaining the gait findings, as balance findings suggest that individuals who are anxious may be visually scanning for threats. This hypothesis may explain greater front-back movements with quicker corrections in the eyes open, feet on firm surface conditions and quicker corrections in the eyes open, unstable surface conditions. However, these findings do not explain the smaller spatial movements in unstable environments. Smaller spatial movements in unstable environments and vision-occluded balance may be best explained by the fact that anxiety increases physiological arousal, which is associated with a reduced center of pressure displacement and increased leg muscle activation [26\u201328], although this study did not measure leg muscle activity.\n4.3.3. Implications\nThe findings of this study have implications in multiple fields, as it gives insight into how best to recognize feelings of anxiety among young adults while also providing the gait variables most often reported in the literature. The findings from this study suggest that there are signals, specifically in locomotion, which can be helpful to identify individuals who are feeling anxious using IMU sensor technology. Based on the accuracy of the results of this study, the authors suggest future researchers try to capture additional data during locomotion and should focus their efforts on trying to capture signals that document variance in locomotion. Additionally, these findings suggest that even though the participants of this study were young, those who reported feeling anxious mimicked the gait patterns most often observed among older adults who are fearful of falling. Although this study did not measure locomotion in athletic competition, these findings may be of importance to tactical and sports athlete trainers as they may find individuals who report feeling anxious are constantly threat scanning and walking in a protective manner, which may influence their athletic performance. These findings may also be of interest to clinicians working in the movement analysis realm (i.e., physiotherapists), as some of the instability/declines in balance that they may note may be due to anxiety instead of functional deficits.\n4.3.4. Limitations\nThis study is not without limitations. The primary limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design. However, a recent investigation suggests that not all individuals report feeling anxious even when using anxiety-provoking conditions [52]; therefore, suggesting that researchers trying to identify when an individual is feeling anxious may have difficulty inducing anxiety. These inter-individual differences in responses to various anxiety-provoking conditions suggest that for an exploratory study, a cross-sectional design may be ideal. Another limitation is that feelings of anxiety are self-reported measures that may have inherent reporting bias. The Hawthorne effect may also be at play here, as individuals who normally would not report feeling anxious may have been anxious when they reported to the lab [53]. The Hawthorne effect further underscores the importance of this study, as there is a need for technology that may be used to identify feelings of anxiety in the moment. Another potential limitation of the findings is that the individuals identified in this study may have had gait deviations due to factors other than anxiety\nthat may not have been accounted for in this study (i.e., pain). Additionally, this study eliminated individuals who reported some anxiety (POMS-SF scores of 1 and 2), which may have provided additional insight into how locomotion changes as feelings of anxiety increase. Lastly, due to the small sample size, the models reported in this study had a median accuracy of 75%, and some of the best models had 100% accuracy. The models with 100% accuracy rates may have just been \u201clucky\u201d in the training and test sets of data that were used. However, those models that reported 100% accuracy do provide insight into the fact that the accuracy of the models may significantly improve with larger sample sizes. Future research should examine other movements and try to perform these studies with larger sample sizes. Future studies should also try to understand the chronicity of anxiety in the population and whether individuals who report feeling anxious more frequently and/or more intensely may more permanently alter their gait patterns and/or create compensatory mechanisms in walking gait."

            "text": "The purpose of this exploratory study was to use machine learning to identify young adults who currently report feeling anxious. The findings from this study are aligned with previous literature in that these models were able to identify individuals who reported feeling anxious with 75% accuracy. These results identified that locomotion was more important than quiet balance at identifying anxious individuals. Additionally, this study found that variances in the upper extremity, trunk, and neck movement may be the most important features in identifying anxious individuals. These findings also suggest that young adults who reported feeling anxious exhibit walking patterns similar to older adults who report fear of falling. This study also reported that quiet balance among young adults who currently report feeling anxious was different compared to those not feeling anxious. Future studies should try to capture locomotion data in larger populations while also trying to capture other signals that may help create more accurate models.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/s22093163/s1, Table S1: Gait Variables.
