It was discovered that the PVP made in organic solutions was more stable, and no pyrrolidone impurity production was seen, unlike when polymerization was carried out in aqueous solvents with H2O2 as an initiator.5 The polymerization of NVP in polar media by radicals i.e. HOc garnered some attention in the literature,7\u201316 where the mechanism and kinetics have been investigated.10,11,16 However, the alkoxy radical polymerization in organic solvents was not studied with the same fervor, despite of the fact that the PVP made in organic solutions was more stable and no pyrrolidone impurity production was seen.4,5\nIn the eld of radical reactions and polymerizations, the in silico approach has gained popularity recently as a technique for analyzing the kinetics and mechanism of radical processes. While using the least amount of resources and time possible, new techniques and procedures create dependable data.17\u201330 In this study, we use a well-established method based on quantum chemistry,16,31,32 to investigate the alkoxy radical (TBOc and CMOc) polymerization of N-vinylpyrrolidone in IP and TL."

Thus in the IP solution, the NVP can react with three main radicals including IP-C2c, TBOc and CMOc, whereas in the TL solvent, the IP-C2c is replaced by the TL-C7c radical.\nTo gain insight into the structure of the TSs, the AIM analysis was used to measure the intermolecular contacts (Table S1, Fig. S2, ESI\u2020). It was found that the TS-IP-C2-H-OTB/OCM-IP are stabilized by intermolecular contacts at the H5/C2, H5/O13, (TBO)H3/O2, (TBO)H3/H1, (TBO)H1/C1, (CMO)H1/O2, (CMO)C4/H1 and ring critical points (RCPs) at RCP1, RCP2 and RCP3, whereas those of the C1\u2013H are only dened by intermolecular contacts H7/C1, H7/O13, (CMO)C6/H1 and RCP1, RCP2. Intermolecular contacts and RCPs dene the stability of TSs of the TS-IP-O2-H-OTB/OCM-IP; however, the EH\u2013 B(O2\u2013H12) values (EH\u2013B(O2\u2013H12) = \u221287.5 and \u221290.3 kcal mol\u22121) are signicantly lower than the EH\u2013B(C2\u2013H5) values (EH\u2013B(C2\u2013H5) = \u221269.3 and \u221269.9 kcal mol\u22121). Therefore, the O2\u2013H12 bond may be more difficult to break than the C2\u2013 H5 bond when forming the products. This may account for the high stability of TS-IP-C2-H-OTB/OCM-IP and the rapid Habstraction at the C2\u2013H bond.

It was found that the RAF reaction at C7 position dominated the NVP + IP-C2c/TL-C7c reactions (G = 99.9%), however the rate constant of the NVP + IP-C2c reaction (koverall = 6.21 \u00d7 103 M\u22121 s\u22121) was about 103 times faster than that of the NVP + TL-C7c (koverall = 4.50 M\n\u22121 s\u22121). The other reactions had no contributions to the overall rate constant of the alkyl radical scavenging activity ofNVP. Thus for the alkoxy radicals i.e. TBOc and CMOc, the NVP + TBOc/CMOc reactions were only focused on the RAF pathway at the C7 position (Table 3 and Fig. 4).\nAs shown in Table 3, the alkoxy radical reactions of NVP in the IP solvent were faster than in the TL solution. The NVP + TBOc/CMOc reactions in the IP solution were about 9.1 and 3.5\nFig. 5 The propagation reactions.\n23406 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 23402\u201323408\ntimes faster than those in the TL solution for TBOc and CMOc respectively. It is important to notice that in the IP solution, the formed radical from the solvent (IP-C2c) can react with NVP as fairly fast as the NVP + TBOc/CMOc reactions (k = 103\u2013105 M\u22121 s\u22121), thus the IP-C2c may also contribute to the propagation reactions. However, in the TL solution, the NVP + TBOc/CMOc reactions were about 103\u2212104 times faster than the NVP + TLC7c reaction.\nThe AIM analysis (Table S1, Fig. S2, ESI\u2020) indicated that energies (EH\u2013B) of the C7/C/O intermolecular contacts of RAF transition states are in the range of \u221213.1 to \u22129.8 kcal mol\u22121. The replacement of themethyl group at TBOc by phenyl at CMOc could reduce the EH\u2013B(C7/O) values, particularly in TL solvent. That may be a reason for the high rate constant of the CMOc + NVP reaction."

These radicals were thought to follow the RAF pathway, the basic reaction mechanism of radical chain polymerization, and react with NVP at the most active site (C7). Thus, using the QM-ORSA approach,33 the propagation rate constant (kp) of the reaction between IP-C2-C7NVP/TL-C7-C7-NVP/TBO-C7-NVP/CMO-C7-NVP and NVP was determined. The results are provided in Table 4, and the TSs are illustrated in Fig. 5.\nAs shown in Tables 4, in the IP solution, the kp value of the IP-C2-C7-NVP + NVP reaction (kp = 1.20 \u00d7 10\n3 M\u22121 s\u22121) was similar to that of the TBO-C7-NVP + NVP reaction (kp = 2.10 \u00d7 103 M\u22121 s\u22121), whereas these values were about 36.4 and 63.6 (for IP-C2-C7-NVP and TBO-C7-NVP, respectively) times higher than that of the CMO-C7-NVP + NVP reaction (kp = 3.30 \u00d7 10 1 M\u22121\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

That is in good agreement with the experimental data.4 However, when (TBO)2 is used as an initiator, the PVP may contain both the solvent (IP) and initiator (TB) structures. A similar trend was also observed in the TL solvent, the TLC7-C7-NVP/TBO-C7-NVP + NVP reactions were about 24.4 (kp = 6.10 \u00d7 103 M\u22121 s\u22121) and 4.4 (kp = 1.10 \u00d7 10\n3 M\u22121 s\u22121) times faster than the CMO-C7-NVP + NVP reaction (kp = 2.50 \u00d7 10 1 M\u22121 s\u22121), respectively. Being the solvent, the amount of TL is signicantly greater than that of the initiators, i.e. (TBO)2 or (CMO)2, thus the PVP produced this way could contain residues of both the solvent (TL) and initiators (TB, CM), despite the rate constant of the TL-C7c + NVP reaction being lower than those of the TBOc/CMOc + NVP reactions (Table 3).\nThe investigation of the chain extension (adding the second NVPmolecule) revealed that the kp values (kp= 10\n1\u2013102 M\u22121 s\u22121, Table 4, Fig. 3 and 5) were comparable to those of the initial propagation reactions. It appears that the rate constants of the propagation reactions are in the range of 101\u2013103 M\u22121 s\u22121, depending on the performed radicals and solvents.\nSince the atoms adjacent to the center of the radicals are identical, the propagation rate constants of CMO-C7-NVP + NVP in both IP and TL were found to be lower than those of other propagation reactions. However, the kp values for the CMO-C7NVP-C7-NVP + NVP were fairly similar to those of the TBO-C7NVP-C7-NVP + NVP reactions. This could be due to the steric effects of CMO in the CMO-C7-NVP + NVP reaction.60"

            "text": "Using computational chemistry, the mechanism and kinetics of the alkoxy radical polymerization of N-vinylpyrrolidone in organic solvents, namely isopropanol, and toluene, have been successfully determined. It was discovered that both solvents, i.e. isopropanol and toluene could contribute to the initiation reactions alongside the initiator radicals TBOc and CMOc. The rate constant varied as a function of the initiators and solvents used. The values of the constant rate of propagation were approximately 101\u2013103 M\u22121 s\u22121. In all of the analyzed organic solvents, the radical polymerization of NVP with (CMO)2 as an initiator occurred fairly similarly with (TBO)2, whereas the solvents could contribute to the radical polymerization of NVP."
