    "abstractText": "The reaction of mer-(Ru(H)2(CO)(PPh3)3) (1) with one equivalent of thymine acetic acid (THAcH) unexpectedly produces the macrocyclic dimer k1(O), k(N,O)-(Ru(CO)(PPh3)2THAc)2 (4) and, concomitantly, the doubly coordinated species k1(O), k(O,O)-(Ru(CO)(PPh3)2THAc) (5). The reaction promptly forms a complicated mixture of Ru-coordinated mononuclear species. With the aim of shedding some light in this context, two plausible reaction paths were proposed by attributing the isolated or spectroscopically intercepted intermediates on the basis of DFT-calculated energetic considerations. The cleavage of the sterically demanding equatorial phosphine in the mer-species releases enough energy to enable self-aggregation, producing the stable, symmetric 14-membered binuclear macrocycle of 4. The k1-acetate iminol (C=N-OH) unit of the mer-tautomer k(O)-(Ru(CO)(PPh3)2(THAc)) (2) likely exhibits a stronger nucleophilic aptitude than the prevalent N(H)-C(O) amido species, thus accomplishing extra stabilization through concomitant k2(N,O)thymine heteroleptic side-chelation. Furthermore, both the ESI-Ms and IR simulation spectra validated the related dimeric arrangement in solution, in agreement with the X-ray determination of the structure. The latter showed tautomerization to the iminol form. The 1H NMR spectra in chlorinated solvents of the kinetic mixture showed the simultaneous presence of 4 and the doubly coordinated 5, in rather similar amounts. THAcH added in excess preferentially reacts with 2 or trans-k(O,O)-(RuH(CO)(PPh3)2THAc) (3) rather than attacking the starting Complex 1, promptly forming the species of 5. The proposed reaction paths were inferred by spectroscopically monitoring the intermediate species, for which the results were strongly dependent on the of conditions the reaction (stoichiometry, solvent polarity, time, and the concentration of the mixture). The selected mechanism proved to be more reliable, due to the final dimeric product stereochemistry.",

Due to the forms of isoe ergetic resonance, it is commonly assumed that the lactim\u2013lactam tautomerism prevails over the enol\u2013keto equilibrium. In a previous report, the absorption at 1918 cm\u22121 was attrib ted to a mixture of 2, while more extensive degradation was exclusively assigned to 2a in keto form (see Supplemental Figure S6). The IR s ectrum of 2a, indicated as a precursor of the metallacycle\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3983 11 of 19\n4, shows a pattern with 1683 (CO asym), 1654 (CO sym), and 1362 (C-O) cm\u22121 bands, typical of the structure of monohapto-acetate. The Ru-carbonyl moiety appeared at 1918 cm\u22121 with weak broad absorption of Ru-H at \u03bd = 2044. The acidic nature of the lactam form increased in the tautomerized lactim form through the presence of the iminol-(HO-C=N) moiety. Likewise, the imino-nucleophilic aptitude, permitting self-aggregation towards the center of Ru\u2019s center, was strongly enhanced. We believe that the tautomeric equilibrium from the lactam to the lactim forms was triggered by both the intramolecular interaction of H of the O-H-O type and by the extensive intermolecular H-binding network. The key to the rearrangement of the Ru-monohapto-thymine acetate 2a to the minor tautomeric iminol species relies on the promotion of H-transfer to the stable lactim form. On the other hand, the growing IR absorbance at \u03bd = 1511 (w) in the k1-acetate precursor 2b may be associated with the Ru-CO at \u03bd = 1930 and the weak carbonyl thymine band observed at 1737 cm\u22121, indicating the tautomerized transformation towards the \u201ctransient\u201d lactim \u2013((HO)C=N-C(O)NH) species (see Supplemental Figure S4). It is conceivable that the N-imine moiety of 2b may exhibit a nucleophilic aptitude to the center of Ru which is stronger than that of the stable keto-amino species, thus favoring a concerted cleavage of the opposite equatorial phosphine to alleviate steric congestion. This process is triggered by multiple intermolecular interactions, which shuttle the transfer of H to promote the transformation to the iminol forms [20\u201329]. The coordination of Ru enables the stabilization of the unstable tautomer through the intramolecular interaction o fH (O-H\u2014\u2014(O)C-ORu) between the tethered carboxy unit and the C2(OH) iminol moiety of C (Figure 10), as suggested by the observed high-shifted signal at \u03b4 = 11.2.

NMR Characterization\nAs revealed by the Ru-H triplet at \u221216.9 ppm, the remaining solution, composed of the related isomer, 2b, underwent thermodynamically driven evolution of the chelate k2(O,O)3. Meanwhile the insoluble microcrystalline white powder of 4 was dissolved in a 1:1 EtOAc\u2013CH2Cl2 solvent mixture and purified upon filtration on a celite pad. The resulting compound showed 1H NMR signals at \u03b4 5.75, 3.20, and 1.91 (see Supplemental Figure S1) in CDCl3, attributed, respectively, to the methyne, N-methylene, and methyl groups. Due to the extreme insolubility, any attempts to dissolve the microcrystalline white powder in deuterated Me2SO (dielectric constant \u03b5 = 46.7) or MeOH (dielectric constant \u03b5 = 32.6) led exclusively to rapid decomposition within 36 h at room temperature. However, the 31P NMR spectrum of CDCl3 revealed two residual doublets at 44.1 and 47.6 ppm assigned to the cis-located phosphine ligands of 4, and a broad signal at 38.4 ppm attributable to the decomposition to the chelate precursor, trans-k2(O,O)-((CO)(PPh3)2(THAc)), which was around \u03b4 = 29 (see Supplemental Figure S2) was the predominant signal, due to the OPPh3-oxidized phosphine released from the mer-k1(O)-2a.\n2.3.3.

The vibrational frequencies were calculated at the optimized geometries to check the stability of the stationary points. The free energies at the boiling temperature of toluene (383.8K) were evaluated by applying a scale factor of 0.9824 to the vibrational frequencies, which was adequate for the present combination of functional DFT and the basis set [57] and a hypothetical pressure of 294.7 atm for the toluene solvent [58], to correct the overestimation of the entropic contributions.

            "text": "By reacting 1 with one equivalent of THAcH after standing for 30 days at \u221220 \u25e6C in CDCl3, both 4 and 5 were formed. This unexpected result can be explained by postulating the intercepted intermediates as key reaction steps. The self-aggregation of the rapidly formed monohapto-acetate 2a, followed by the mutual addition of heteroleptic (N,O) produced 4. Conversely, the homoleptic chelation of 2b to form the chelated species 3 was kinetically competitive, promoting the further incorporation of the THAc ligand to produce 5. The energetic considerations calculated by DFT enabled us to interpret the mechanism through the penta-coordinated derivatives, postulated as rather low energetic transition states. The trans\u2013cis rearrangement required the occurrence of a much higher energy barrier than the nucleophilic attack of the mer-monohapto acetate of 2 on the reciprocal Ru site, which released an apical ligand, to produce the resulting cis-P,P stereochemistry. The proposed mechanism supports the facile promotion of H to explain the tautomerization from keto-amino to iminol species, exhibiting a stronger Ru-nucleophilic reaction of the k1(O)-coordinated thymine ring by regulating the distribution of the kinetic products. The observed dynamic behavior of the particular aptitude for the transfer of H, by keeping the metallic scaffold, might suggest further tailored catalytic processes, such as isomerization, as in the case of the chelate homoleptic k2(O,O)- species [13] or novel insight into therapeutic antitumor agents for the versatile heteroleptic k2(N,O) compounds [3]. Trapping small molecules such as solvents or CO2, or sequestering alkaline metal ions may also constitute some visionary applications of the macromolecule 4, considering its behavior as an organometallic crown ether. These targeted topics could be the subjects of novel perspectives and future investigations.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28103983/s1.
