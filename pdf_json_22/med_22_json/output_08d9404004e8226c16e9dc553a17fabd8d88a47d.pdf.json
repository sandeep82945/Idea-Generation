As a corollary, the random\nnull expectations to which disparity is compared and interpreted may be unrealistic. We tackle this issue by representing, in ge-\nographical space, distinct processes of phenotypic evolution underlying ecological disparity. Under divergent natural selection,\nassemblages in a given region should have empirical disparity higher than expected under an evolutionarily oriented null model,\nwhereas the opposite may indicate constraints on phenotypic evolution. We gathered phylogenies, biogeographic distributions,\nand data on the skull morphology of sigmodontine rodents to discover which regions of the Neotropics were more influenced\nby divergent, neutral, or constrained phenotypic evolution. We found that regions with higher disparity than expected by the\nevolutionary-oriented null model, in terms of both size and shape, were concentrated in the Atlantic Forest, suggesting a larger\nrole for divergent natural selection there. Phenotypic disparity in the rest of South America, mainly the Amazon basin, northeastern\nBrazil, and Southern Andes, was constrained\u2014lower than predicted by the evolutionary model. We also demonstrated equivalence\nbetween the disparity produced by randomization-based null models and constrained-evolution null models. Therefore, including\nevolutionary simulations into the null modeling framework used in ecophylogenetics can strengthen inferences on the processes\nunderlying phenotypic evolution.\nKEY WORDS: Brownian motion, evolutionary macroecology, functional diversity, null model, phylogeny, trait evolution.\nMacroevolutionary dynamics of trait evolution have been a major focus of research in evolutionary biology. Recently, the ability to test for different models of trait evolution using neontological data (Butler and King 2004; Beaulieu et al. 2012) spurred a wealth of research on the macroevolutionary patterns and processes of evolutionary radiations. However, such studies are commonly placed only on a macroevolutionary scale, that is, they investigate the evolution of species and traits with a phylogeny, but analyze the spatial location of species as a state/factor (Jablonski et al. 2006; Rolland et al. 2014) or ignore it. The lack of explicit consideration of geographical space, including cases in which\n\u2217 These two authors contributed equally.\nspace is simply treated as a biogeographical factor and/or used as averages of environmental variables through species range, can be problematic because selection pressures are different across disparate regions of a continent (Sexton et al. 2009; Marcondes and Brumfield 2020). On the other hand, studies in related disciplines as ecophylogenetics (Davies 2021) have explicitly considered species geographical location, as well as phylogenetic and trait data. However, the trait-based approaches employed in these disciplines usually focus on high-level patterns (functional and phylogenetic diversity) and lack consideration of evolutionary models/processes (Cadotte et al. 2017), and this is the major focus of this manuscript. For example, explicit models of trait evolution (Brownian Motion [BM], Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\n1790 \u00a9 2022 The Authors. Evolution \u00a9 2022 The Society for the Study of Evolution. Evolution 76-8: 1790\u20131805\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /evolut/article/76/8/1790/6966164 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n[OU], Early-Burst [EB]) are often omitted from the ecophylogenetics framework (Cadotte et al. 2017; Davies 2021). Instead, they investigate phenotypic disparity (often labeled \u201cfunctional diversity\u201d or, more specifically, \u201cfunctional dispersion\u201d) (Novack-Gottshall 2016) at various geographic locations, and assess its deviations from null models M\u00fcnkem\u00fcller et al. 2020). The null model can be constructed in different ways (Swenson 2014; Davies 2021), but often involves randomization procedures that bear little to no explicit connection to an underlying model of trait evolution (Pigot and Etienne 2015). Therefore, although the evolutionary biology literature usually does not take explicit account of geographical location in studies of trait evolution, ecophylogenetics usually search for high-level patterns contrasting to null models that are disconnected from processes of trait evolution.\nTo address these problems, we took explicit consideration of geographical assemblages composed of multiple species of sigmodontine rodents and propose the use of evolutionarily oriented null models (instead of randomization-based null models) to discover how each assemblage deviates from a given evolutionary model (Table 1). Specifically, we (1) estimated, at the interspecific level and using the empirical traits, the most likely values for the parameters in BM, EM, and OU models; (2) mapped, in geographical space and at the level of ecological assemblages, the deviations of empirical disparity relative to disparity simulated under the best-fit macroevolutionary model\u2014that is, the evolutionarily oriented null model\u2014to find geographic regions of neutral, divergent, and constrained phenotypic evolution; and (3) analyzed whether and how randomization-based null models relate with evolutionarily oriented null models (Fig. 1).\nA few proposals have similar goals of addressing geography and/or evolutionarily oriented null models. Davies et al. (2012) compared empirical body size variance to BM- and OUsimulated phenotypic variance to infer character displacement in desert mammal communities; however, they ignore geography. Mazel et al. (2017) used evolutionarily oriented null models (in that case a neutral model) to infer trait convergence and divergence at both lineage (macroevolutionary) and assemblage (geography) scales, showing fairly high trait convergence in mammalian traits between faunas from Australia and geographically distant regions, and high trait divergence between temperate mammalian faunas. Although this is a good example of a study linking macroecology and macroevolution, Mazel et al. (2017) did not explore other evolutionary models, such as the ones that produce expectations of explosive radiations (EB) and constrained evolution (OU). Pigot and Etienne (2015) developed a null expectation that considers rates of speciation, colonization, and local extinction (the \u201cDAMOCLES\u201d model) for estimating phylogenetic diversity metrics. DAMOCLES is a powerful approach in ecophylogenetics that advances from randomization-\nbased null models toward historical signals of community dynamics owing to speciation, colonization, and extinction versus ecological filtering mechanisms (Pigot and Etienne 2015). Like other methods, DAMOCLES is a spatially implicit model (although it is potentially applicable to several communities). Our focus on trait evolution efficiently accounts for deviations of phenotypic disparity from evolutionary models across geography, as shown below.\nHere, we simulated evolutionary scenarios of trait evolution to obtain expectations of how phenotypic disparity would appear at broad spatial scales, using phylogenies as background null hypothesis (Davies 2021). Theoretically, we predict that the magnitude of the phenotypic disparity across different spatial portions (hereafter, assemblages) should vary according to the evolutionary model underlying trait evolution (Fig. 1). Because models of trait evolution predict phenotypic disparity across branches of a phylogenetic tree, phenotypic disparity in any given assemblage depends on the mean phylogenetic distance between the species present in each assemblage (Fig. 1) (Tucker et al. 2018). Thereby, an OU model of evolution with a single optimum would generate a constrained and constant level of disparity regardless of which species are reunited in any given assemblage. This expectation of constant disparity is true even though an OU model/pattern is consistent with different evolutionary processes. However, it should be noted that this expectation breaks down if, for example, a lineage only recently entered a single OU optimum or if the alpha parameter is too low, in which cases the pattern could be closer to a Brownian model. An EB model of evolution would, in turn, produce disparities that heavily depend on the species composition of each assemblage, because among closely related species disparity would be very low, whereas disparity would be high for distantly related species (Harmon et al. 2008). Disparity under a BM model of evolution would be intermediate because closely related species tend to resemble each other more than species chosen at random from the phylogeny. We evaluated these predictions by simulating traits over a set of empirical, equally plausible phylogenetic trees, and then projected the phenotypic disparity from the simulations into geographical space using empirical geographical distributions of species at the assemblage level. Doing that allowed us to contrast empirical disparity with the disparity expected under an evolutionary model (i.e., creating an evolutionarily oriented null model) rather than with a simple randomization-based null model (Table 1).\nWe investigated phenotypic disparity in skull size and shape across assemblages of sigmodontine rodents in the Neotropical region. Sigmodontinae, a subfamily of Cricetidae, underwent fast evolutionary radiation that resulted in >400 species (Mammal Diversity Database 2022) in \u223c10 million years after dispersal from North America (Leite et al. 2014).

Such high diversification rates do not seem to be accompanied by a comparable level of adaptive disparity when seen from a macroevolutionary perspective (Carrizo et al. 2014; Alhajeri et al. 2016; Maestri et al. 2017). The adaptive disparity in appendicular morphology (Carrizo et al. 2014; Alhajeri et al. 2016; Coutinho et al. 2017) and the skull and mandible (Maestri et al. 2016, 2017) seem to be relatively low and only weakly associated with ecological variables. Yet, we do not know how empirical disparity is distributed across space and therefore lack information about particular geographic regions where phenotypic disparity may reflect divergent natural selection. Although unrelated to trait variation, high species diversification rates have been used as an indicator for adaptive radiation in the entire clade (Schenk and Steppan 2018), and a subclade (Reis et al. 2018). Other studies have suggested that trophic diversification contributed to trait divergence in a major subclade of sigmodontines (Missagia et al. 2019, Missagia et al. 2021). Thus, prior evidence for the role of widespread adaptive disparity is equivocal, making sigmodontines an ideal group for investigations of phenotypic disparity and its deviations from evolutionary-oriented null models across space. To investigate if and how many geographic regions have higher phenotypic disparity than expected by a given model of evolution, we compared the phenotypic disparity found across assemblages with the disparity expected for each assemblage given the evolutionary model most fitted to the empirical data (decided through linear models). Lastly, we calculated deviations of the observed disparity from randomizedbased null models and evolutionarily oriented null models to compare them. If disparity in skull size and shape across (at least some) assemblages is compatible with scenarios of strong divergent natural selection, we expect to recover values of phenotypic disparity consistently higher than a Brownian model of evolution."

The software TPSDig2 (Rohlf 2015) was used for digitizing the landmarks, and the Procrustes superimposition was performed in R with the package \u201cgeomorph\u201d (Adams et al. 2020). The skull is an informative structure because it harbors many critical functions of the organism, including both sensory and feeding functions (Swanson et al. 2019); accordingly, landmarks were chosen to identify structural and functional differences among skulls, covering the whole structure (Maestri et al. 2017).\nPhylogenetic relationships among 413 sigmodontine species were assessed from a sample of 100 phylogenetic hypotheses from Upham et al. (2019). The molecular time-trees were built using a supermatrix of 11 genes (eight nuclear and three mitochondrial regions) picked from a comprehensive mammalwide study (Upham et al. 2019). Those trees included 279 sigmodontine species with DNA sequence data, with the missing species being randomly added considering taxonomic resolution and a same birth-death distribution (Thomas et al. 2013; Upham et al. 2019). Details of tree construction can be found in Maestri et al. (2017) and Upham et al. (2019). Such a sample of completed trees (vs. the single consensus tree restricted to species with DNA sequences) provides a way of accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty in evolutionary simulations and ecophylogenetic metrics. However, in some circumstances completed trees may bias the estimation of evolutionary rate parameters compared to DNA-only phylogenies (Rabosky 2015), and the application of models of trait evolution on a consensus-only phylogeny proved to perform well even with high proportions of missing taxa (Marcondes 2019). Therefore, all the analyses in this article we repeated (1) using a set of 100 phylogenies from the completed trees to account for phylogenetic uncertainty, and (2) using the DNA-only consensus phylogeny. After matching biogeographic, phenotypic, and phylogenetic data, a set of 216 species containing information on all three levels was obtained considering the complete phylogenies, and 169 species considering the DNA-only phylogeny. Analyses in this article were conducted on four levels: (i) using the completed 413 species trees (used only for trait simulations, 100 trees with 413 species), (ii) using the reduced dataset of 216 species (100 trees with 216 species), (iii) using only species from the Oryzomyalia radiation (100 trees with 200 species), and (iv) on the consensus phylogeny only (169 spp.). Analyzing the subclade Oryzomyalia alone makes sense because the most explosive radiation of sigmodontines was hypothesized to be at the origin of this subclade (Schenk et al. 2013; Leite et al. 2014; Parada et al. 2015). In the main article, we include only the results using the complete trees of 413 species, but results from the remaining levels and on the consensus phylogeny can be found in Appendices S2\u2013S4."

            "text": "We calculated phenotypic disparity using data with two different dimensions: (i) univariate, in the case of skull size, and (ii) multivariate, in the case of skull shape. The skull size and shape of each species was obtained by averaging size and shape values across individuals in the skull dataset of 2765 individuals (12.13 \u00b1 16.84 individuals per species; Appendix S1). The size and shape of a single individual was used when a species had just one individual in the skull dataset. Empirical phenotypic disparity per assemblage was calculated for each dataset using Rao\u2019s quadratic entropy (Rao 1982). Rao\u2019s entropy is calculated by summing the squared distances between each pair of species in an assemblage, multiplied by 1/n (Botta-Duk\u00e1t 2005), which is similar to common disparity indices used in morphometrics and paleontology that sum squared species\u2019 distances from the average shape, divided by N \u2013 1 (Zelditch et al. 2012). For incidence matrices (i.e., without abundances, as in this case), Rao\u2019s entropy becomes equivalent to mean pairwise (phenotypic) distances, which makes it directly comparable to mean phylogenetic distances (see below).\nPhenotypic disparity, like other indexes of phenotypic/functional diversity, is positively correlated with species richness (S) or has larger variance at low levels of richness (Figs. S2.1, S2.2) (Petchey and Gaston 2006; Swenson 2014). The disparity metric of mean pairwise distances is insensitive to proportion of species sampled, number of characters in the phenotypic dataset, and proportion of missing data (Ciampaglio et al. 2001), which are desirable properties of the metric. Notwithstanding, for empirical datasets, phenotypic disparity increases with the number of species sampled under a variety of metrics, including mean pairwise distance, until \u223c27% of the species is sampled (Ciampaglio et al. 2001), which likely reflects a biological phenomenon. Even if there is a weak correlation between disparity and richness and/or correlation between disparity and richness is biological and unexpected mathematically, there is interest in discovering geographic regions with higher/lower disparity than predicted by richness alone (Swenson 2014). Therefore, a measure of phenotypic disparity that controls variation related to S would improve the inference of mechanisms and spatial variation underlying phenotypic disparity. To tackle this issue, we first used a randomization-based null model where we shuffled species across the morphological dataset (Swenson 2014) and then calculated Rao\u2019s entropy using a total of 1000 iterations (Figs. S2.1, S2.2). Randomizations produced 1000 null estimates of Rao\u2019s entropy that were then compared to the empirical Rao\u2019s entropy. We calculated the standardized effect size (SES) of Rao\u2019s entropy that measures, for each assemblage, how extreme is the empirical disparity relative to the average of\n1794 EVOLUTION AUGUST 2022\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /evolut/article/76/8/1790/6966164 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nnull estimates of Rao\u2019s entropy. The SES of assemblage i was calculated as follows\nnullSES i = (empirical Rao i \u2212 mean (null Rao i)) /SD (null Rao i) .\nThe resultant disparity is therefore a measure of empirical disparity compared to a randomization-based null model. Before calculating empirical disparity compared to an evolutionaryoriented null model, we will first introduce the evolutionary models in the next topic.

Macroevolutionary models were fitted to the data of skull size and phylogeny using the function \u201cfitContinuous\u201d of Geiger R package, and parameters estimated through Maximum Likelihood (Harmon et al. 2008). Under the BM model, the list of estimated parameters included the \u03b8\u2014the ancestral character state, which we set to zero\u2014and the \u03c3\u2014the evolutionary rate. Under the EB model, the list of estimated parameters included \u03b8, \u03c3, and \u03b2\u2014the exponential rate of evolution. Finally, under the OU model, the list of estimated parameters included \u03b8, \u03c3, and \u03b1\u2014the strength of selection. The average and standard error associated with each estimate and model were reported in the results. For each model, we ran 1000 simulations under these parameters for each of the 100 trees, and then calculated disparity for each of the 100,000 simulated traits, which were later averaged for further analyses.\nMultivariate trait simulations: We used multivariate trait simulations to obtain a dataset with a dimension equivalent to skull shape. We used the mvSIM function of the \u201cmvMORPH\u201d package of R (Clavel et al. 2015) to produce 1000 different datasets of multivariate traits evolving under the BM model of evolution. This time, parameters used in multivariate trait simulations came from a multivariate Generalized Least Squares (GLS) linear model fitted to the data of skull shape and to each phylogeny. The multivariate GLS model is suitable for estimating macroevolutionary parameters for nonindependent, evolutionarily integrated traits such as landmarks depicting the skull shape\n(Clavel et al. 2019). Parameters of this model were estimated using a penalized-likelihood framework using the ridge regularization in calculating the maximum likelihood (option \u201cRidgeArch\u201d in the function \u201cmvgls\u201d implemented in the \u201cmvMORPH\u201d R package) (Clavel et al. 2015). We used the method of Mahalanobis to estimate model parameters as it has been shown to be efficient in maximizing a cross-validated log-likelihood function for intercept-only models. We used only the BM model as it was not computationally feasible to estimate parameters for the other models (even when using the less complex \u201cRidgeArch\u201d regularization). Thus, as a note of warning, computational limitations should be considered when using multivariate GLS on overly multidimensional data (Clavel et al. 2019; see Table 1). For each model, we ran 1000 simulations under these parameters for each of the 100 trees, and then calculated disparity for each of the 100,000 simulated traits, which were later averaged for further analyses."

We regressed assemblage-level disparity, both empirical and simulated, averaged across phylogenies and simulations of each evolutionary model, with SES of empirical phylogenetic distances averaged across phylogenies.

Therefore, when scaled-up to the assemblage level, phenotypic disparity produced from a single-optimum OU model should be the same as the disparity produced by randomizing species identity without a phylogeny. To test that expectation, we calculated the coefficient of correlation (Pearson\u2019s correlation) for the relationship between the disparity simulated under OU, EB, and BM and the disparity obtained by shuffling species identity in the trait datasets.

Standardized by an OU model of evolution, the resulting map of phenotypic disparity in skull size resembles the previous map but showed places of lower-than-expected disparity in size, such as western and southern Andes, parts of the Amazon basin, and northeastern Brazil (compare the maps [a] and [c] in Fig. 3).

Empirical disparity in most of the rest of South America is constrained\u2014it is lower than predicted by OU and Brownian evolution, for size and shape, respectively. In the case of sigmodontines, the close phylogenetic relationship between species making up local assemblages (Maestri and Patterson 2016; Schenk and Steppan 2018) was also evident here in the low mean pairwise phylogenetic distance within assemblages, which may help to explain the low phenotypic disparity through most of South America except the Atlantic Forest region (as discussed below in PHENOTYPIC DISPARITY OF SIGMODONTINE RODENTS).\nBy using evolutionarily oriented null models (Table 1), we could directly compare empirical disparity with that expected under the best-fit macroevolutionary model, and consequently implicate the evolutionary processes underlying the ecological disparity seen in nature (Davies et al. 2012; M\u00fcnkem\u00fcller et al. 2020; Davies 2021). We also demonstrated equivalence between the disparity produced by randomization-based null models and a constrained-evolution model (OU with single optimum), which to our knowledge is an unprecedented result. Given the equivalence between randomization-based null models and the singleoptimum OU model, the inclusion of evolutionary simulations into the traditional null modeling framework used in ecophylogenetics can strengthen inferences concerning the processes underlying trait evolution; this allows the direct comparison of empirical disparity with alternative models (Cadotte et al. 2017; Davies 2021). Moreover, by keeping species identities in their original assemblages and attributing to them a new phenotype given a reasonable evolutionary model, the evolutionarily oriented null model has similar advantages to a geographically restricted null model for the same purpose (Table 1)."

Tucker et al. (2018) simulated trait evolution over a tree to understand if phylogenetic diversity (PD\u2014Faith 1992) is a proxy for functional diversity (FD), and demonstrated that PD correlates better with FD as the number of traits evaluated increases. However, models of evolution and empirical disparity were not compared inter se. In general, articles focusing on functional diversity seek to discover its congruence with phylogenetic diversity (Safi et al. 2011; Oliveira et al. 2016; Mazel et al. 2018; Garc\u00eda-Navas 2019; de la Sancha et al. 2020) and/or ask which is the most appropriate regional pool to conduct the randomization (i.e., focus on the spatial scale; Taudiere and Violle 2016), but again models of trait evolution across trees were not considered. Here, our focus is on the distribution of phenotypic diversity itself to understand which processes are likely responsible for its variation, either related to modes of evolution across phylogenies (explored here) or whether the deviations are explained by ecologically relevant axes (not explored here).\nA different way to include realism in null models is to alter the characteristics of assemblage membership instead of species\u2019 traits. Pigot and Etienne (2015) proposed a highly realistic null expectation for phylogenetic assemblage patterns by incorporating rates of speciation, extinction, and colonization to determine community composition in the null model (the DAMOCLES model). Although exploring alternative null models of species assembly is beyond the scope of this article, we suggest that the simulations of trait evolution proposed here can be combined with DAMOCLES. Such an approach would simultaneously allow (i) assessing the contribution of speciation, extinction, and colonization for species assembly and (ii) evaluating deviations of trait disparity from a Brownian model of evolution or from any other evolutionary model."

Using continuous ancestral range reconstructions (Quintero et al. 2015), they found that each of the major subclades (the tribes Oryzomyini, Akodontini, Thomasomyini, Phyllotini, and Abrotrichini) had a different center of origination, with most appearing adjacent to the Andes. Major exceptions are members of the Oryzomyini, whose area of original diversification lies in the Amazon (Schenk and Steppan 2018; Maestri et al. 2019; Percequillo et al. 2021), and\nAkodontini, whose center of diversification may have been in eastern South America (D\u2019El\u00eda and Pardi\u00f1as 2015; Maestri et al. 2019).

The group includes the largest living sigmodontines (Kunsia), reaching up to approximately 600 g (Bezerra and Pardi\u00f1as 2016), fossorial forms (Blarinomys), semi-aquatic species (Scapteromys), as well as more typical cursorial forms. An equally broad array of diets accompanies this locomotor diversity (Missagia et al. 2019). The tribe includes nearly 70% of the insectivorous rodents in South America (D\u2019El\u00eda and Pardi\u00f1as 2015; Maestri et al. 2017), as well as species that consume green vegetation, seeds, or have omnivorous diets (Missagia et al. 2019; Pardi\u00f1as et al. 2020). This trophic diversification is accompanied by disparate masticatory mechanisms (Missagia et al. 2021) and corresponding gastrointestinal morphologies (Pardi\u00f1as et al. 2020). Moreover, akodontines were the only tribe that had climatic variables associated with their species diversification (Reis et al. 2018); for other tribes, diversification appears better associated with dispersal (e.g., Oryzomyini\u2014Percequillo et al. 2021) and with allopatric fragmentation (Schenk and Steppan 2018), with little ecological speciation (Maestri et al. 2017). The diversification of akodontines in terms of lifestyle, locomotion, diet, and physiology through a divergent natural selection process may explain the higher morphological disparity seen in the Atlantic Forest region. Moreover, the region harbors a considerable diversity of members of Oryzomyini in addition to Akodontini, which may help explain the high phenotypic disparity in this region."

            "text": "We suggest that understanding geographic variation in phenotypic disparity (or functional diversity) should be made considering explicit comparisons between empirical and evolutionary simulated data. Such comparisons allow for assessing disparity against macroevolutionary models, permitting robust assessments of processes underlying phenotypic evolution. Moreover, this framework places macroevolutionary interpretations in a geographically explicit framework, helping to introduce geographic\n1802 EVOLUTION AUGUST 2022\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /evolut/article/76/8/1790/6966164 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nheterogeneity into macroevolutionary processes. Evolutionary radiations on continents are likely a mosaic of regions where lineages were subjected to strong divergent natural selection, leading to high adaptive disparity, and regions where other processes predominate and may produce little phenotypic differentiation; this is the case of sigmodontine rodents. Accounting for this mosaic of different processes helps create a link between traditional macroecological analyses using spatial grids with macroevolutionary models tracking tip traits across the branches and nodes of phylogenies."
