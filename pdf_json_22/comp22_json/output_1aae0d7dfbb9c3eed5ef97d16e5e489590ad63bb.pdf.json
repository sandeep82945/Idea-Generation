However, 47 the related method is still unable to solve the conflicts between targets or between 48 drugs. With the release of high-precision protein structure prediction artificial 49 intelligence (AI), large-scale high-precision protein structure prediction and docking 50 become possible. In this article, we propose a multi-target drug discovery method. 51 Then we take an example of therapeutic hypothermia (TH). We performed protein 52 structure prediction for all targets of each group by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold. 53 QuickVina 2 is then used for molecular docking of the proteins and drugs. After 54 docking, we use PageRank to get the rank of drugs and drug combinations of each 55 group. Given the differences in the scoring of different proteins, the method can 56 effectively avoid inhibiting beneficial proteins. So it\u2019s friendly to 57 chronopharmacology. This method also have potential in precision medicine for its 58 high compatibility with bioinformatics. 59\n60\n61 Keywords: multi-target therapeutics; chronopharmacology; precision medicine; 62 Therapeutic hypothermia; virtual screening; 63\n64\n65\n66 67\n.

Therefore, highly selective and potent molecules are being 70\ndeveloped for a distinct target.[1] However, in the application of this strategy, the 71\nhybrid drugs or chimeric drugs could not solve the problem of interaction between 72\ndrugs or targets.[2] Besides, this approach also has disadvantages when dealing with 73\ntime-specific proteins. These defects limits the application of this strategy. 74\nTake therapeutic hypothermia as an example. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) can limit 75\nthe degree of some kinds of injuries in randomized trials[3] and animal 76\nexperiments[4], and is even the only effective method for some diseases especially 77\nhypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE often causes severe neurological 78\nsequelae, which is the main reason for the poor prognosis of patients with stroke, 79\nshock, carbon monoxide poisoning, cerebral hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest.[5\u20137] 80\nIn the research based on TH, cold shock proteins especially cold-induced RNA 81\nbinding protein (CIRP) show high expression [8] and rapid response [9]. CIRP has 82\nbeen shown to promote the translation of genes involved in DNA repair [10,11], 83\ntelomerase maintenance[12], and genes associated with the translational 84\nmachinery[13]. 85\nHowever, if CIRP leaks to the intercellular substance with cell swelling and rupture, it 86\nwill become a harmful protein. Extracellular CIRP (eCIRP) showed a strong pro-87\ninflammatory effect, leading to a heavier hypoxic injury.[14,15] So, agonists applied 88\nwith CIRP can effectively promote cell protection before CIRP leaks out of the cell. 89\nAfter the leakage of CIRP out of the cell, the application of the CIRP antagonist can 90\neffectively promote cell protection. 91\nWith the development of high-precise protein prediction technologies, especially 92\nAlphaFold2[16] and RoseTTAFold[17], we can obtain the structure of proteins 93\nquickly and accurately, and widespread docking becomes possible. In this article, we 94\nprovide a multi-targeted drug discovery method. This method attempts to include all 95\n.

Protein and drugs 3D 101 structure acquisition and prediction; 3. Proteins\u2019 active sites prediction; 4. 102 Drug/molecular group evaluation with target proteins; 5. PageRank of docking results, 103 protein logFC, and mRNA expression. The experiment of animals or cells is referred 104 to by authors, but not forced. The biggest difference from previous studies is 105 PageRank. 106\n107 The data source of bioinformatics analysis 108\nWe retrieved the original data of mRNA expression under hypothermia treatment from 109\nthe website of The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 110\n(GSE54229). The research was reported by Sten et.al.[9] In their research, mouse 111\nembryonic fibroblasts were exposed to mild hypothermia (32\u00b0C) or normothermia 112\n(37\u00b0C) to gain the transcription response induced by hypothermia. After 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 113\nand 18 hours of hypothermia, cells were collected for bioinfomatics analysis. 114 115 Expression Profile Analysis 116 The log2 fold-change (log2FC) and p-value were calculated for the normothermia 117 group. Top 3 log2FC mRNA with q-value < 0.05 were selected from each group to 118 enter the next step. If there exists mRNA with failed protein structure prediction, the 119 mRNA would be skipped. 120 R 3.6.1 was used to detect di erential expressed compared to matched normothermia 121 samples. The clustering of genes was calculated by the \u201cdist\u201d and \u201chclust\u201d function of 122 R. The visualization of gene expression and clustering is performed by the 123 \u201cdendextend\u201d package. 124\n125 3D Data of proteins and small molecular drugs 126\nAll proteins were first searched on PubMed to see if there was protein clipping like 127\ncleaved caspase-3[18]. 128\n.

In this article, 130 no protein structure is listed on the PDB website. All the protein structures were 131 predicted by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold. 132\nAlphaFold2 is developed by Google and is the champion of the 14th Critical 133\nAssessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14). In August 2021, AlphaFold submitted 134\na structure prediction database for all proteins. RoseTTAFold is based on the Rosetta 135\nsoftware which is designed for macromolecular modeling, docking, and design[19] 136\nRoseTTAFold also has good application[20] in the research of protein structure 137\nprediction. Finally, protein structures with fewer irregular regions will be selected for 138\nthe next step. 139 The 3D structures of 8,697 drugs (DrugBank, 5.1.8) were downloaded from 140 DrugBank Online (https://go.drugbank.com/). Approved, experimental, nutraceutical, 141 and investigational drugs by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are included. We 142 split each drug molecule into a PDBQT-format file and minimized the energy 143 separately for docking with proteins. 144\n145 Visualize evolutionary conservation and active site prediction 146\nVisualize evolutionary conservation was performed by the ConSurf server[21]. In a 147\ntypical ConSurf application, through BLASTed[22] against the UNIREF-90 148\ndatabase[23] and aligning using MAFFT[24], the evolutionarily conserved positions 149\nare analyzed by the Rate4Site algorithm. 150\nThen, the Consensus approach-D (COACH-D) [25] was used to predict the active site 151\nof target proteins. The COACH-D uses five different methods to predict the binding 152\nsites of protein ligands. Four of these methods are COFAC-TOR[26], FINDSITE[27], 153\nTM-SITE[28], and S-SITE[28]. These methods predict binding sites by matching the 154\nquery structure and sequence with the ligand-binding template in BioLiP[29], which 155\nis a semi-manual functional database[30] based on the PDB. 156 157 Virtual screening of potential compounds 158\n.

QuickVina 2 uses the 161\ncalculation of shape and electrostatic potential similarity of binding pockets to select 162\nmolecules, which may exhibit binding patterns like those of binding pockets. 163 3D files of target proteins were dehydrated and hydrogenated. Then proteins were 164 saved as PDBQT files using AutoDock. AutoDock assisted in assigning Gasteiger 165 charges and adding polar hydrogen atoms to both the proteins and the compounds. 166\n167 Molecular dynamics simulation 168\nThe molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed by Gromacs[32]. Firstly, a 169\nprotein-drug complex was prepared, including adding hydrogenation and balancing 170\ncharge. Then, we add a solvent so that the target protein and small molecules are 171\ncoated. The forcefield was Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics 36 172\n(CHARMm 36). The simulation time is set as 50ns for the speed of calculation. The 173\nsimulation temperature is 309.15K (36 ) and the pressure is 1 atm. Root mean square 174\ndeviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) were calculated based 175\non the first frame. 176 177 Personalization-weight-PageRank 178\nWe use personalization-weight-PageRank to rank cross-level data. PageRank is a 179\ncomprehensive rank algorithm designed by Google and named after Larry Page.[33] It 180\nis one of the most famous ranking algorithms of network nodes based on the Markov 181\nprocess. PageRank has been applied in medical domains with success.[34,35] 182\nPersonalization and weight represent 3 different levels of score data. The weight of 183\nPageRank allows all nodes to be initially assigned different weights/probabilities.[36] 184\nIn this article, the weights of rank were set to docking values of proteins and drugs. 185\nThe higher the docking value, the higher the connection rate of the complex. 186\nPersonalization of PageRank reinforces the connection intensity between the nodes, 187\n.

In this article, 188\npersonalization is influenced by protein functions. If the protein performs a negative 189\ninfluence such as promoting apoptosis, the personalization will be calculated by 190\n2^(fold change) to ensure they are more than 1. Meanwhile, if the protein plays a 191\npositive role in the group, the personalization will be set as 1/(fold change + 1) to less 192\nthan 1. The personalization values of all the drugs are set to 0 to prevent iterations of 193\nthe drugs themselves from going wrong. 194 The calculation process is like putting all proteins and all drugs in the solution, then 195 simulating the connections between all proteins and drugs by calculation. The 196 damping factor is set to 0.85 to simulate the metabolism of proteins and drugs. 197 The whole calculation is based on Python 3.8.10. The relating python libraries include 198 NetworkX, Pandas, and NumPy. We use Pandas and NumPy to import all the docking 199 data into a matrix for PageRank calculating. The protein expression value is then 200 imported by the PageRank personalization parameter of NetworkX. Lastly, we can get 201 a comprehensive ranking of drugs. 202\n203 Prediction and Rank of combined pharmacotherapy 204 In addition to the comprehensive ranking of drugs, we also try to generate the rank of 205 drug combinations. Similarly, the calculation places all drugs of combination and 206 target proteins in a solution to bind free. 207 First, all drugs will be grouped according to the docking results of drugs in each 208 combination. In this article, to reduce the amount of calculation, we selected the 209 TOP20 drugs of each protein to include in the drug combination pool. Then, all the 210 combinations were performed personalization-weight-PageRank against all protein 211 targets. The sum of each score of all drugs in the combination is the final score of the 212 combination. Lastly, we get the rank of combinations. 213 To make the distribution of combinations clear, we propose drug-protein-expression 214 fit score (DPEFS) to show the data distribution pattern.

From the inside to the outside, the rings were divided into hypothermia 228 0.5h group, hypothermia 1H group, hypothermia 2H group, hypothermia 4H group, 229 hypothermia 8h group, and hypothermia 18h group. 230 As shown in Table 1, in each group, we selected the top 3 expression protein targets. 231 In the Hypothermia 0.5h group, the target proteins are circadian-associated 232 transcriptional repressor (CIART), Glutathione-specific gamma-233 glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1), and Uridine diphosphate glucose 234 pyrophosphatase nudix hydrolase 22 (NUDT22). The target proteins of the 235 Hypothermia 1h group are CHAC1, corneodesmosin (CDSN), and Nuclear receptor 236 subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1). The target proteins of the Hypothermia 2h 237 group are cold-induced RNA-binding protein (CIRP), armadillo repeat-containing X-238 linked protein 5 (ARMCX5), and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 122 239 (CCDC122). The target proteins of the Hypothermia 4h group are CIRP, receptor 240 activity-modifying protein 3 (RAMP3), and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell 241 adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). The target proteins of the Hypothermia 4h group 242 are the same: CIRP, RAMP3, and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1). 243\nWithin the targets, CHAC1 could enhance apoptosis[38]. NUDT22 is an Mg2+-244\ndependent UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose hydrolase[39], while high glucose shows 245\na negative effect in HIE like stroke[40]. CCDC122 potentially pro-inflammatory[41]. 246\nCIRP can effectively reduce cell death in the early stage of hypothermia therapy. 247\nHowever, it has a strong pro-inflammatory effect outside the cell, leading to cell 248\nkilling. There is no definitive research on the timing of this shift. Referring to the 249\nprevious article[42], we conservatively believed that CIRP could be identified as a 250\nnegative protein from the 8H group. CEACAM1[43] and NQO1[44] promote 251\napoptosis. All the other targets are shown protective effects or don't have enough data. 252\nThe personalization values were calculated in Table 1. All the structures of target 253\nproteins in Figure 3 were obtained by the rules in the section of Materials and 254\nMethods. 255\n.

The 259 redder the amino acid, the higher possibility of the amino acid sequence with function. 260 Then we identified its structure-function relationship by the COACH-D server. The 261 results showed a familiar result of conservation analysis listed in Figure 4L-V. As 262 shown in Table 2, the range around 3-5 \u00c5 of the active site was used for the setting of 263 the receptor pocket of the target proteins that were used for virtual screening. 264\n265 Virtual Screening of target proteins\u2019 Antagonists 266 We utilized the virtual screening technique to identify potential antagonists exhibiting 267 an adequate binding a nity. We started with a chemical database consisting of 8,697 268 drug molecules and isolated a set of compounds satisfying the threshold of a high 269 docking score. The results of the best match complexes are shown in Figure 5 and all 270 the results are listed in the Additional file Table 1. 271\n272 MD Simulations and Binding Free Energy Analysis 273 We performed the MD simulation of 11 complexes to measure the stability of the 274 protein-ligand complex. RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) profiles of the protein 275 are shown in Figure 6A, which indicates that all systems were relatively stable during 276 the entire simulation run. Moreover, RMSF profiles of protein are measured to 277 evaluate the moving of each amino acid. All proteins are available for further analysis 278 (Figure 6B). 279 The RMSD of drug atoms was also conducted to predict the stability of the atoms in 280 docked complexes (Figure 6C). Most compounds exhibited a consistently low RMSD, 281 suggesting that these compounds formed stable complexes. 282\n283 Drug rank of TH in different groups 284 We rank all drugs by PageRank. First, we PageRank all the drugs and get the results 285 in table3. The higher the rank, the protective effect in TH. The lower the rank is, the 286 more damaging it is in TH. 287\n.

This is the first application of PageRank and first 296 attempt of AI protein prediction in the field of multi-target drug discovery. 297 In this paper, due to the high compatibility of PageRank, except for basic mRNA 298 expression differences, the analysis of Weighted Gene Coexpression Network 299 Analysis (WGCNA)[45] or Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN)[46] will be better 300 because they could provide numerical results of all proteins. For the same reason, 301 PageRank has good compatibility with existing pharmacological techniques such as 302 pharmacophore models[47] and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship 303 (QSAR)[48]. 304\nAlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold were used for protein structure prediction. And the 305\nnumber of selected proteins predicted by AlphaFold2 in this research was close to that 306\nof RoseTTAFold. During the process of protein structure prediction, we found that for 307\nsome proteins, the structures predicted by RoseTTAFold have less irregular structure 308\nthan that of AlphaFold2. This may be due to the 2D distance map level being 309\ntransformed and integrated by RoseTTAFold during neural network training[17], 310\nwhile AlphaFold2 only paired structure database and genetic database[16]. We also 311\nfind a phenomenon that the predicted protein structures were relatively unstable under 312\nmolecular dynamics simulation than preview reports of other protein structures 313\ndetected by X-ray. 314 We use the PageRank algorithm to rank all the drugs and combinations. The 315 application of PageRank is suitable. The combination of drug molecules is a 316 memoryless stochastic process, which meets the qualifications of the Markov process. 317 The comprehensive analysis involves free docking of proteins with all drugs. Drug 318 combination analysis is to put proteins and related drugs into the solution for docking. 319 Besides, the method has good compatibility with the wide compatibility of PageRank. 320 In theory, all the technologies with numerical results can be ranked by the method. 321 In addition, due to the charastic of PageRank, we can adjust the weight of different 322 proteins to suppress the negative proteins with minimal impact on the positive ones. 323 This property is very beneficial for chronopharmacology. It is difficult for one 324\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseIt is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

For tumors, it is 326 possible to effectively antagonize most of abnormally expressed proteins while 327 limiting the affection of normal proteins. Given this approach's close association with 328 bioinformatics, bioinformatics can predict the most suitable drug for every patient in 329 most diseases. 330 This research has some defects. 1: For the speed of calculating, we only choose the 331 top 3 mRNAs for docking and the top 1 complex for MD simulation. Furthermore, the 332 duration of molecular dynamics simulation is set to 50ns. These operations mitigate 333 the rationality of the results relatively; 2. Theoretically, pharmacophore modeling has 334 a better improvement under PageRank. But considering lacking related copyright and 335 the purpose of the article, we chose to dock FBI-approved drugs with target proteins 336 to explore the interaction between proteins and drugs. 337 In summary, this paper proposes a new method through protein structure predicting 338 and PageRank. The results provide medical clues for the treatment of TH. This 339 method takes a new attempt at drug discovery, which might make a little bit of a 340 difference in pharmacology. 341\n342\n343 344 345\n.
