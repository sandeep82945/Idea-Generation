Notably the role of the dilaton in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity is played by the radion in a suitably orbifolded version of the setup. In the classical entanglement entropy calculation, there is an apparent degeneracy of Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces. We demonstrate how quantum fluctuations of the radion/ dilaton resolve this would-be classical puzzle regarding entanglement wedge reconstruction.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.231601\nIntroduction.\u2014Recent use of the doubly holographic Karch-Randall braneworld [1,2] has yielded substantial insights into quantum gravity. These include analytical models that have been used to produce Page curves describing black hole radiation in higher-dimensional (i.e., in d > 2 spacetime dimensions) setups [3,4,5], demonstrating a connection between the existence of entanglement islands and massive gravity theories [4,10,11], providing simple holographic models to study quantum field theory in black hole backgrounds [12,13], and motivating a novel holographic setup: wedge holography [10,11,14,15]. Wedge holography is a simple canonical deformation of the original Karch-Randall braneworld that manifests a codimension-two holographic duality [10,11,14,15]. This setup starts with two AdSd (AdS, anti\u2013de Sitter) KarchRandall branes in an ambient AdSd\u00fe1 with the two branes intersecting each other at the conformal boundary of the ambient spacetime. These branes are treated as \u201cend-of-theworld\u201d (EOW) branes, meaning that the part of the ambient spacetime behind them is excised. Thus, the leftover bulk spacetime is a wedge [see Fig. 1(a)]. In analogy with the original Karch-Randall braneworld, the wedge system is doubly holographic in that there are three equivalent descriptions related to each other by the AdS=CFT correspondence [16\u201318] (see Fig. 1): (i) bulk description, Einstein-Hilbert gravity in the wedge; (ii) intermediate\ndescription, two CFTd\u2019s (CFT, conformal field theory) coupled with gravity living on separate AdSd\u2019s and glued to each other along their asymptotic boundaries by imposing transparent boundary conditions; (iii) boundary description, a CFTd\u22121 living on the common asymptotic boundary of the two branes [which is the corner of the wedge in Fig. 1(a)]. In this Letter, we study wedge holography when the bulk is AdS3 with two AdS2 branes. As opposed to the original wedge holography setup in higher dimensions where the brane fluctuations can be neglected, we will consider fluctuating branes with orbifold projection so that there is only one fluctuating scalar degree of freedom. This scalar is the \u201cradion\u201d in the language of the Randall-Sundrum I setup [19]. We will derive an action for the radion that is coupled with the 2d localized braneworld gravity. This can be thought of as the low-energy effective theory of the intermediate description. We will see that this theory is\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The importance of our study is that it ensures the consistency of wedge holography in AdS3. This is because when we ignore the brane fluctuations and study the entanglement entropy in AdS3 wedge holography using the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula, we find an infinite number of degenerate RT surfaces. This renders the entanglement wedge, which is an essential element in holography [23], as undefined. Taking into account the brane fluctuations, this degeneracy is lifted, as we show explicitly using our effective JT description. We note that JT gravity [24\u201328] has also played an important role in the recent development of lowdimensional (d \u00bc 2) quantum gravity [6,7,29]. This includes providing an analytically controllable model to compute the Page curve of evaporating black holes [6,7] and a precise duality between Euclidean JT gravity to a random matrix ensemble [29]. Our realization of JT gravity in the Karch-Randall braneworld further argues for its significance in our study of quantum gravity [30]. Karch-Randall braneworld and wedge holography.\u2014In this section, we briefly review the Karch-Randall braneworld and wedge holography, focusing on the geometric pictures for later holographic study. The original theory of Karch and Randall is described by the following action:\nS \u00bc \u2212 1 16\u03c0Gd\u00fe1\nZ dd\u00fe1x ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212gbulk p \u00f0R\u00bdgbulk \u2212 2\u039b\u00de\n\u2212 1\n8\u03c0Gd\u00fe1\nZ ddx ffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212h p \u00f0K \u2212 T\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere the first term is the standard Einstein-Hilbert action describing gravity in the ambient AdSd\u00fe1 with a cosmological constant \u039b \u00bc \u2212\u00bdd\u00f0d \u2212 1\u00de=2 (we have set the AdS curvature length to 1), the second term describes the embedding of the brane in the ambient AdSd\u00fe1, hab is the induced metric on the brane, K is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the brane, and T is the tension of the brane and satisfies T \u2264 \u00f0d \u2212 1\u00de as a Karch-Randall brane. (The critical value T \u00bc d \u2212 1 corresponds to the RandallSundrum brane [19,31].) The bulk metric fluctuations satisfy the Neumann boundary condition near the brane\n\u2207n\u03b4gbulk \u03bc\u03bdjnear brane \u00bc 0; \u00f02\u00de where n denotes the normal direction of the brane. With this boundary condition taken into account, setting the variation of the action Eq. (1) to zero we obtain two equations of motion: the usual Einstein\u2019s field equation that determines the bulk geometry and the brane-localized equation of motion describing the embedding of the brane in the bulk. The latter is given by [32]\nKab \u00bc \u00f0K \u2212 T\u00dehab: \u00f03\u00de\nThis system of equations can be solved by\nds2bulk \u00bc dr2 \u00fe cosh2\u00f0r\u00deds2AdSd ; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere r \u2208 \u00f0\u2212\u221e;\u221e\u00de, with the brane given by r \u00bc r1 \u00bc const: and T \u00bc \u00f0d \u2212 1\u00dej tanh r1j (we only consider positive tension branes) [33]. The bulk metric is just empty AdSd\u00fe1 written as a foliation into AdSd slices. This is particularly useful in the study of the Karch-Randall braneworld as here the brane geometry r \u00bc const: is clearly AdSd. In this Letter, we focus on the case d \u00bc 2, in which case the geometry can be easily visualized as that on the left of Fig. 2(a). In the wedge holography setup [10,11,14,15], we add another (positive tension) Karch-Randall brane. This system is described by the following action:\nS \u00bc \u2212 1 16\u03c0G3\nZ d3x ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212gbulk p \u00f0R\u00bdgbulk \u2212 2\u039b\u00de\n\u2212 1\n8\u03c0G3 Z i\u00bc1;2 ddx ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212hi p \u00f0Ki \u2212 Ti\u00de; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere we impose the Neumann boundary conditions [Eq. (2)] for the bulk metric fluctuation near both branes. The equations of motion still consist of two parts: the bulk Einstein\u2019s equation and the two brane-localized equations, with each one the same as Eq. (3) but with their own tensions T1 and T2. Hence, a solution is given by the same bulk metric [Eq. (4)] with d \u00bc 2, where r \u2208 \u00f0r1; r2\u00de, T1 \u00bc tanh\u00f0\u2212r1\u00de, T2 \u00bc tanh r2, r1 < 0, and r2 > 0. This geometry is visualized in Fig. 2(b). Realizing JT gravity.\u2014In the original wedge holography papers [10,11,14,15] the branes are treated as rigid. This assumption is rooted in the original Karch-Randall setup where we just have one brane and we can take the brane to be sitting at an orbifold fixed point to model an EOW brane in analog to O-planes in string theory [35,36]. However,\n231601-2\nreminding ourselves of the Randall-Sundrum I setup [19] with two Randall-Sundrum branes, the relative distance between the branes is a dynamical variable called the \u201cradion,\u201d which has important phenomenological implications [37]. Hence, in the case of wedge holography, we should not neglect the possibility of brane fluctuations. In this section, we consider small brane fluctuations (relative to the bulk AdS3 curvature scale) and derive the effective action for the coupling between these small fluctuations and the brane-localized graviton mode by doing dimensional reduction. While brane fluctuations can be neglected in higher dimensions, we will see that this small contribution plays an important role when the bulk is AdS3. The detailed derivation and a more careful analysis will be presented in [30]. To be precise, we will consider two branes with tensions T1 and T2 sitting at r \u00bc r1 \u00fe \u03b4\u03d51\u00f0x\u00de and r \u00bc r2 \u00fe \u03b4\u03d52\u00f0x\u00de slices of the following bulk geometry:\nds2 \u00bc dr2 \u00fe cosh2\u00f0r\u00degab\u00f0x\u00dedxadxb; \u00f06\u00de\nwith the relationships T1 \u00bc \u2212 tanh r1 > 0 and T2 \u00bc tanh r2 > 0 satisfied and \u03b4\u03d51; \u03b4\u03d52 \u226a 1 (the AdS length scale has been set to 1). The wedge runs from r \u00bc r1 \u00fe \u03b4\u03d51\u00f0x\u00de to r \u00bc r2 \u00fe \u03b4\u03d52\u00f0x\u00de, and the metric ansatz [Eq. (6)] describes the lowest 2d graviton mode [the higher modes would depend on the coordinate r as gab\u00f0r; x\u00de]. To obtain the low-energy effective action, we have to plug the above ansatz of the metric and brane locations into Eq. (5) and keep terms only up to orderO\u00f0\u03b4\u03d52\u00de. This yields the following action (for details of the derivation, we refer readers to [30]):\nSeff \u00bc S0 \u2212 1\n16\u03c0G3\nZ d2x ffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212g p \u03d5\u00f0x\u00de\u00bdR\u00bdg \u00fe 2 \u00fe Sdilaton;\n\u00f07\u00de\nwhere \u03d5\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u03b4\u03d52\u00f0x\u00de \u2212 \u03b4\u03d51\u00f0x\u00de is the radion mode, S0 is a purely topological term,\nS0 \u00bc \u2212 r2 \u2212 r1 16\u03c0G3\nZ d2x ffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212g p R\u00bdg ; \u00f08\u00de\nand Sdilaton is the kinetic term for the brane fluctuations\nSdilaton \u00bc \u2212 1\n8\u03c0G3\nZ d2x ffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212g\np T2 2 \u2207\u03bc\u03b4\u03d52\u2207\u03bc\u03b4\u03d52 \u00fe T2\u00f0\u03b4\u03d52\u00de2\n\u00fe T1 2 \u2207\u03bc\u03b4\u03d51\u2207\u03bc\u03b4\u03d51 \u00fe T1\u00f0\u03b4\u03d51\u00de2 : \u00f09\u00de\nIn analogy to the Randall-Sundrum scenario, to isolate the dynamics of the radion we have to orbifold our setup. We can project out either \u03b4\u03d51\u00f0x\u00de or \u03b4\u03d52\u00f0x\u00de by a canonical orbifold prescription: start with an array of an infinite number of paired wedges, mod out the translation\nsymmetry on the array to a single pair of wedges with Z2 symmetry, and then mod out this Z2 symmetry (see Ref. [30] for details) to get a single wedge with only one fluctuating brane. The possibility of projecting out either \u03b4\u03d51\u00f0x\u00de or \u03b4\u03d52\u00f0x\u00de is gauge-equivalent. To see this gauge equivalence, without loss of generality we can project out \u03b4\u03d51\u00f0x\u00de and redefine gab\u00f0x\u00de such that the final action is independent of r1 and r2. Specifically, by setting\n\u03b4\u03d51\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 0; gab\u00f0x\u00de \u2192 e\u2212T2\u03b4\u03d52\u00f0x\u00degab\u00f0x\u00de; \u00f010\u00de\nthe total action becomes\nSeff \u00bc S0 \u2212 1\n16\u03c0G3\nZ d2x ffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212g p \u03d5\u00f0x\u00de\u00bdR\u00bdg \u00fe 2 ; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere now the dilaton field is \u03d5\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u03b4\u03d52\u00f0x\u00de. This is precisely Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity [20,21] for AdS2. However, there is no nontrivial profile for the dilaton on the AdS2 background without a cutoff [38]. This cutoff breaks the asymptotic conformal symmetry and allows the theory to have finite energy excitations [26]. Hence, we fix a small cutoff \u03f5 and fix the boundary metric for the nearly AdS2 and the dilaton field to be\ngab\u00f0x\u00dejbdydxadxb\u00bc\u2212 du2\n\u03f52 ; \u03d5\u00f0x\u00dejbdy\u00bc\u03d5b\u00bc \u03d5r \u03f5 : \u00f012\u00de\nOne subtlety of our derivation is that we have to take \u03d5b \u223c \u03f5 (or \u03d5r \u223c \u03f52) to ensure that the brane fluctuation is always small, i.e., \u03b4\u03d5i\u00f0x\u00de \u226a 1. We emphasize that this scaling is special to our setup. For example, it does not appear in dimensional reduction for the near-horizon region of a fourdimensional near-extremal black holes [39,40]. In that case \u03d5b is determined by the linear-in-temperature coefficient of the near-extremal black hole entropy [28]. In our case, without an UV completion of the underlying higherdimensional theory, \u03d5b is a free parameter. (We thank Subir Sachdev for useful discussions regarding this interesting point.) In our case, the UV completion is a conformal quantum mechanics system [30], which differs from the UV completion into a black hole. Translating to the AdS3 language [Eq. (6)], we have to take a cutoff of the AdS3 wedge and fix the metric there to be (see Fig. 3 for an indication)\nds2bdy \u00bc dr2 \u2212 cosh2\u00f0r\u00de du2\n\u03f52 : \u00f013\u00de\nNow that we have identified this cutoff and boundary conditions for the metric in the AdS3 bulk, we have to add the corresponding boundary term to the total action [Eq. (5)]. The boundary term is the usual GibbonsHawking (GH) term\n231601-3\nSbdy \u00bc SGH \u00bc \u2212 1\n8\u03c0G3\nZ d2xbdy ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212hbdy p K\u00f03\u00de; \u00f014\u00de\nwhich can be shown to be\nSbdy\u00bc\u2212 2\u00f0r2\u2212r1\u00de 16\u03c0G3 Z \u2202M dx ffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212h p K\u2212 2\u03d5b 16\u03c0G3 Z \u2202M dx ffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212h p K;\n\u00f015\u00de\nwhere K is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the cutoff boundary of the AdS2. With this term added to Eq. (11), we get the full-fledged JT gravity action as that in [41]. We refer readers to [30] for more details. A puzzle and its resolution.\u2014A canonical quantity to study in AdS3 wedge holography is the entanglement entropy between the two asymptotic defects that support the dual quantum mechanics [see Fig. 2(b)]. This can be calculated using the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula [42,43] by studying the RT surfaces that connect the two branes [10,14]. Choosing global AdS2 for those AdS2 slices, the bulk metric [Eq. (4)] can be written as\nds2 \u00bc dr2 \u00fe cosh2\u00f0r\u00de\u00bd\u2212cosh2\u00f0\u03b7\u00ded\u03c42 \u00fe d\u03b72 ; \u00f016\u00de\nif we ignore the brane fluctuations \u03b4\u03d5i\u00f0x\u00de. The RT surface can be parametrized as \u03b7 \u00bc \u03b7\u00f0r\u00de, \u03c4 \u00bc const:, which leads to the area functional\nA \u00bc Z r2\nr1\ndr ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1\u00fe cosh2\u00f0r\u00de\u03b70\u00f0r\u00de2 q : \u00f017\u00de\nIt is easy to show that, with the boundary term carefully taken into account, the variation of the area functional vanishes if and only if \u03b70\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc 0. Therefore, any constant \u03b7 surface is an RT surface and they all have equal area A \u00bc r2 \u2212 r1 (see Fig. 4 for an illustration). According to this result, there would be no definite RT surface for the entanglement entropy between the two defects and as a\ncorollary there would be no definite entanglement wedge for either of the defects. This would be problematic because it would preclude a holographic interpretation from the point of view of bulk (or more precisely, entanglement wedge [44]) reconstruction. Fortunately, this puzzling result occurs only when the branes are treated as rigid. We expect brane fluctuations to lift the degeneracy of the RT surfaces. Because the brane fluctuation is in general time-dependent, we should use the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) formula [45] to compute the entanglement entropy from the wedge. However, this would be complicated as the result is heavily dependent on properly treating the boundary condition near the brane. This challenge of computing entanglement entropy with brane fluctuations is readily met if we instead do it using our effective braneworld theory [Eq. (11)]. In that case we are just computing the entanglement entropy between the two cutoff boundaries of the nearly AdS2 space. By solving the equation of motion of the dilaton and 2d metric, we have that\nds22d \u00bc \u2212cosh2\u00f0\u03b7\u00ded\u03c42 \u00fe d\u03b72; \u00f018\u00de\n\u03d5\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u03d5r cosh \u03b7 cos \u03c4; \u00f019\u00de\nwhere \u03d5r is a constant. Thus, using the maxmin prescription [46] of the HRT formula, we have\nSEE \u00bc max \u03c4 min \u03b7\n\u03d50 \u00fe \u03d5\u00f0x\u00de\n4G3\n\u00bc \u03d50 \u00fe \u03d5r\n4G3 ; \u00f020\u00de\nwhere the minimization has a solution \u03b7 \u00bc 0, \u03c4 \u00bc 0. As a result, from the bulk AdS3 perspective [Eq. (16)], the RT surface is just the \u03b7 \u00bc 0 surface that sits precisely in the middle of the bulk (i.e., the middle green surface in Fig. 4). Thus, the entanglement wedge of either defect is the half bulk region next to it, which is consistent with the symmetry between the two defects.\n231601-4\nConclusions.\u2014In this Letter, we studied wedge holography when the bulk is three-dimensional. We found that it is necessary to consider brane fluctuations, identified as the radion mode in the braneworld language [19,31], for the apparent consistency of the holographic setup. We found that the low-energy dynamics of the brane fluctuations with orbifold projection is precisely Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity.\nWe are grateful to Andreas Blommaert, Kristan Jensen, Hong Liu, Subir Sachdev, and Douglas Stanford for useful discussions.
