For example, among different investments, we should select the one with the largest gain. In practice, however, we rarely know the exact consequences of each action. In some cases, we know the lower and upper bounds on the corresponding gain. It has been proven that in such cases, an appropriate decision is to use Hurwicz optimism-pessimism criterion. In this paper, we extend the corresponding results to the cases when we only know an upper bound or a lower bound. 1 Formulation of the problem In investment, when a person knows the exact monetary consequence of each action, he/she naturally selects an action with the largest possible gain. In practice, we usually know the consequences only with some uncertainty. For example, instead of the exact gain value, the whole set S of different possible gain values are consistent with our knowledge. How should we then make a decision? What is the equivalent price v(S) that we are willing to pay to participate in the corresponding action? For example, we may know the lower bound a and the upper bound on the gain. In this case, the set S is the interval [a,b]. Alternatively, we may know: \u2022 only the lower bound, in which case S = [a,\u221e) or \u2022 only the upper bound, in which case S = (\u2212\u221e,b].

Suppose that we are willing to pay v(S) for the set S. Then, for the set S and a fixed amount c, we are willing to pay v(S)+ c.\nIn this joint offer, the set of possible outcomes is\nS+ c def= {s+ c : s \u2208 S}.\nSo, a reasonable price to pay for this joint offer is v(S+ c). These are two different descriptions of the same situation. The price that are willing to pay to participate in this situation should not depend on how we describe this situation. So, we should have v(S+ c) = v(S)+ c. This property is called shiftinvariance. Scale-invariance. Another idea is that the transformation S 7\u2192 v(S) should not depend on the choice of the monetary unit. For example, if we select pesos instead of dollars, we should get the same equivalent value.\nIn precise terms, this means v(\u03bb \u00b7S) = \u03bb \u00b7 v(S), where\n\u03bb \u00b7S def= {\u03bb \u00b7 s : s \u2208 S}.\nThis property is known as scale-invariance. Additivity. The third idea is that participation in two independence actions, with sets S1 and S2, is equivalent to participation in a single action with the result\nS1 +S2 = {s1 + s2 : s1 \u2208 S1 &s2 \u2208 S2}.\nThese are two ways of representing the same situation. So we should have\nv(S1 +S2) = v(S1)+ v(S2).\nThis property is known as additivity. Known results (see, e.g., [2]). For interval uncertainty, additivity implies Hurwicz formula v([a,b]) = \u03b1 \u00b7b+(1\u2212\u03b1) \u00b7a for some \u03b1 \u2208 [0,1]. The same formula emerges if we assume shift- and scale-invariance.\n3 What if we only know the lower bound\nDescription of the case. Suppose that we only know the lower bound a. In this case, the set of possible gains is the infinite interval [a,\u221e). What is the price\nf (a) def= v([a,\u221e))\nthat we should pay for this situation?\nWhat if we assume additivity. For infinite intervals,\n[a,\u221e)+ [b,\u221e) = [a+b,\u221e).\nThus, additivity implies that f (a+b) = f (a)+ f (b), for f (a)\u2265 a. It is known that this functional equation implies that f (a) = k \u00b7 a; see, e.g., [1]. The condition a \u2264 f (a) implies that k \u2265 1.\nWhat if we assume scale-invariance. Here,\n\u03bb \u00b7 [a,\u221e) = [\u03bb \u00b7a,\u221e).\nThus, scale-invariance means f (\u03bb \u00b7a) = \u03bb \u00b7 f (a) for all \u03bb > 0 and a. In particular:\n\u2022 for a = 1, we get f (\u03bb ) = k+ \u00b7\u03bb , where k+ def = f (1); and \u2022 for a =\u22121, we similarly get f (\u2212\u03bb ) = k\u2212 \u00b7\u03bb , i.e., f (x) = (\u2212k\u2212) \u00b7 x.\nWhat if we assume shift-invariance. Here,\n[a,\u221e)+ c = [a+ c,\u221e).\nThus, shift-invariance means that f (a+ c) = f (a)+ c. In particular, for a = 0, we get f (c) = a0 + c, where we denoted a0 def = f (0). Since f (0)\u2265 0, we have a0 \u2265 0.\n4 What if we only know the upper bound\nDescription of the case. Suppose that we only know the upper bound a. In this case, the set of possible gains is the infinite interval (\u2212\u221e,a]. What is the price\ng(a) def= v((\u2212\u221e,a])\nthat we should pay for this situation?\nWhat if we assume additivity. For infinite intervals,\n(\u2212\u221e,a]+ (\u2212\u221e,b] =)(\u2212\u221e,a+b].\nThus, additivity implies that g(a+b) = g(a)+g(b), for g(a)\u2264 a. It is known that this functional equation implies that g(a) = k \u00b7 a; see, e.g., [1]. The condition g(a)\u2264 a implies that k \u2264 1.\nWhat if we assume scale-invariance. Here,\n\u03bb \u00b7 (\u2212\u221e,a] = (\u2212\u221e,\u03bb \u00b7a].\nThus, scale-invariance means g(\u03bb \u00b7a) = \u03bb \u00b7g(a) for all \u03bb > 0 and a. In particular:\n\u2022 for a = 1, we get g(\u03bb ) = k+ \u00b7\u03bb , where k+ def = g(1); and \u2022 for a =\u22121, we similarly get g(\u2212\u03bb ) = k\u2212 \u00b7\u03bb , i.e., g(x) = (\u2212k\u2212) \u00b7 x.\nWhat if we assume shift-invariance. Here,\n(\u2212\u221e,a]+ c = (\u2212\u221e,a+ c].\nThus, shift-invariance means that g(a+ c) = g(a)+ c. In particular, for a = 0, we get g(c) = a0 + c, where we denoted a0 def = g(0). Since g(0)\u2264 0, we have a0 \u2264 0."
