            "text": "Deuterated organic materials are widely used in various scientic elds such as in vivo tracing, proteomics, mechanistic studies, and neutron spectroscopy.1 In particular, deuterated drugs are receiving increasing attention, as site-selectively deuterated pharmaceuticals exhibit higher metabolic stability than non-deuterated analogues.2\u20134 Deutetrabenazine, a deuterated analogue of tetrabenazine, is a remarkable example (approved by FDA in 2017, Fig. 1A).3a More recently, donafenib, a deuterated sorafenib analogue, received approval in China (2021).3b The trend towards the introduction of deuterium (deuterium switch, deut-switch) has increased the need for selective and efficient methods for deuterium incorporation into complex organic molecules.4\nChemoselective hydrogen/deuterium isotope exchange (HIE) is an excellent method for chemical deuteration because the product can be quickly accessed from readily available nondeuterated analogues.5 C(sp2) H deuteration by homo- or heterogeneous catalysts has been intensively explored and can be used for deuterating pharmaceuticals.6 Recently, more challenging chemoselective C(sp3) H deuteration has been of particular interest in the synthetic community.7\u201312 For example,\nces, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501,\nar Science, Faculty of Engineering, Gifu pan\na Women's College of Liberal Arts, Kodo,\nmation (ESI) available. See\n751\nMacMillan and coworkers reported photo-redox-catalyzed direct deuteration of pharmaceuticals,8a while Gemmeren reported bC(sp3) H deuteration of carboxylic acids.8b\nCatalytic deuterium incorporation at the a-position of hydroxyl groups using D2O is an attractive strategy to improve the stability of drugs, as the alcohol moiety in pharmaceuticals is oen susceptible to metabolism (Fig. 1B).9 In 1999, Tyler reported the HIE of alcohols with D2O catalyzed by a [(C5H4CH3) Mo(OH)(OH2)] complex. The molybdenum-catalyzed system is a-selective for primary alcohols and a,b-selective for secondary alcohols (Fig. 1C).10 In 2002, Bergman showed that an [IrCp*(P [CH3]3)Cl2] complex universally deuterates alkyl and aryl C\u2013H bonds including a-carbon of alcohols.7a In 2005, Matsubara reported D2O-mediated a-selective deuteration of primary alcohols catalyzed by RuCl2(PPh3)2 with or without NaOD.11 Nishioka found that a glucopyranoside-incorporated N-heterocyclic carbene\u2013iridium complex with AgOTf promotes a-selective deuteration of cyclohexanol.12 Sajiki introduced Ru/Ccatalyzed, stereo-retentive deuteration of sugar alcohols with D2O under an H2 atmosphere.13 In 2011, Jia reported that a [RuCl2(2-NH2CH2py)(PPh3)2 (2-NH2CH2py \u00bc 2-aminomethylpyridine)] complex with KOH promotes a- and b-selective alcohol deuteration while [(h6-cymene)RuCl2]2/NH2CH2CH2OH/ KOH and [(h6-cymene)Ru(NHCHPhCHPhNTs)] deuterate exclusively at b-carbons.14 In 2013, Milstein demonstrated that their Ru-PNN pincer complexes catalyze the deuteration of aand b-carbons of alcohols in the presence of NaOH in D2O.15 Gunanathan reported a commercially available Ru-PNP pincer complex (Takasago Ru\u2013MACHO complex) effectively catalyzes the a- and b-deuteration of alcohols in the presence of KOtBu.16 Vermillion reported that RANEY\u00ae Ni promotes the HIE of\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The chemoselective deuteration of various alcohols proceeded under basic or neutral conditions without being affected by coordinative functional groups and could be successfully used for deuterium-labelling of pharmaceuticals.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nWe chose a structurally robust iridium\u2013bipyridonate complex (Ir-1, Fujita complex) for the direct deuteration of alcohols based on pioneering works on iridium catalysts7a and other metal complexes.11,12,14\u201316 Ir-1 was developed by Fujita for the reversible dehydrogenation of alcohols with exceptionally high functional group tolerance.22 Thus, we expected that a hydrogen-transfer catalytic cycle should operate if the Ir-1mediated dehydrogenation of alcohols is followed by H/D exchange of [Ir\u2013H] with D2O to afford [Ir D] and reductive deuteration of carbonyl compounds by [Ir D] takes place (Fig. 1D)."

            "text": "We selected losartan potassium (1-K+) as a target substrate for deuteration with the aim of investigating the difference in metabolism between deuterated and non-deuterated losartan. The introduction of deuterium at the a-position of the hydroxyl group of 1-K+ should control the C\u2013H bond cleavage during the metabolic oxidation and therefore is of particular interest in medicinal chemistry and metabolic studies.23 However, to the best of our knowledge, the deuterium KIE for the metabolic process of 1-K+-d2 has not been reported to date. So far, one synthetic method has been reported for a-deuterated losartan potassium, which involves the use of N,N-dimethylformamided7 and NaBD4 during eight synthetic steps.23b The establishment of a more accessible route to selectively deuterated losartan should therefore contribute to the development of deuterated pharmaceuticals.\nTable 1 shows the results of catalytic deuteration of 1-K+. Whereas the use of previously reported Ru/C/H2 or a Ru-PNPpincer complex (Ru-MACHO) resulted in no incorporation of deuterium,24 we were pleased to nd that the iridium bipyridonate complex Ir-1 efficiently promotes the a-deuteration of 1- K+ (entry 3 vs. entries 1 and 2). When a mixture of 1-K+ (0.075 mmol, 0.10 M), Ir-1 (5 mol%), NaOD (15 mol%), 2- propanol (50 mol%), and D2O (0.75 mL, 41.6 mmol) was heated at 100 C for 5 h, we obtained 1-K+/Na+ with 55% deuterium incorporation based on 1H NMR analysis (entry 3). Prolonging the reaction time to 36 h increased the deuterium incorporation up to the theoretical value (98% D) without any side-reaction or undesired deuteration at other carbons (entries 4 and 5). The perfect a-C(sp3) H selectivity is in stark contrast with previously known Ir-catalyzed deuterations, which generally exhibit C(sp2) H preference.7,25 The use of the bifunctional, bidentate bipyridonate ligand in Ir-1 is crucial for the selective deuteration at the hydroxyl group C(sp3)-H: Ir complexes such as [IrCp*Cl2]2 or [IrCp*(2-hpy)Cl2] (2-hpy \u00bc 2-hydroxypyridine)25 resulted in no deuterium incorporation (entries 6 and 7). CF3substituted Ir-2 and dimethylamino-substituted Ir-3 were less effective than Ir-1 (entries 8 and 9).22d Cationic Ir-4 and anionic Ir-5 also catalyzed the deuteration of 1-K+, but less efficiently (entries 10 and 11) probably due to unpreferable ratios of neutral and anionic catalytic intermediates.22,26 No deuteration proceeded without Ir-1 or NaOD (entries 12 and 13). The addition of 2-propanol (50 mol%) is critical for keeping Ir-1 active: without 2-propanol, the reaction stops before the deuterated\nChem.

The role of 2-propanol is unclear, but we think that dehydrogenation of 2-propanol increases the concentration of active Ir\u2013H complexes, thereby lowering the concentration of an aldehyde intermediate that potentially causes catalyst deactivation.27 In fact, we observed a decrease in the 1H NMR signal for a-hydrogen of 2-propanol, indicating that 2-propanol is oxidized during the reaction. The deuteration was faster at higher concentrations (0.5 M, entry 16 vs. 4). Limited deuterium incorporation (96% D) reecting the higher concentration of the substrate could be further improved using deuterated 2-propanol (98% D, entry 17). A scale-up experiment (2 mmol scale) was also successful (entry 18).\nDeuterated losartan was easily separated from the Ir catalyst by pH adjustment and extraction. Stepwise neutralization of the reaction mixture with aq H2SO4 allowed us to extract Ir-1 and the protonated form of deuterated losartan ([2H]1) successively into organic layers. The reaction of [2H]1 with KOH and reprecipitation in dry acetone28 gave the desired losartan potassiumd2 in 69% overall yield (96% D, Fig. S1 in the ESI\u2020).\n8746 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 8744\u20138751\nWe next investigated the substrate scope of the Ir-catalyzed HIE reaction (Fig. 2). 1-Propanol (2) was smoothly deuterated under the optimized conditions shown in Table 1, entry 16 (97% D for alpha, >99% yield, t \u00bc 1.5 h). A comparable result was obtained with a less amount of Ir-1 (1 mol%) under milder conditions (conditions I, 97% D for alpha, 95% yield, t \u00bc 7 h, Fig. 3A). We then adopted these conditions to simpler substrates. The current catalytic system proved to be effective for deuterating various primary alcohols (Fig. 2A). Deuteration of simple primary alcohols proceeded with 1 mol% of Ir-1 at 80 C. Deuterium was incorporated selectively at the a-positions (97% D) with minor incorporation at the b-positions (10\u201313% D). Aliphatic alcohol bearing a tetrazole unit (4) was applicable at 100 C. Diol 5 was also deuterated selectively at the a-positions. Benzyl alcohols bearing electron-withdrawing or electrondonating substituents underwent the a-deuteration smoothly. For hydrophobic substrates, methanol-d4 was used as a cosolvent to allow monitoring of the progress of the reaction by 1H NMR spectroscopy (conditions II, e.g., 95% D for [2H]9 (run 1)). In these cases, D2O remains the primary deuterium source, as comparable results were obtained with 1,4-dioxane cosolvent under otherwise identical conditions (94% D for [2H]9 (run 2)).\nTo our surprise, secondary alcohols underwent the adeuteration better under neutral conditions (conditions III, Fig. 2B). For example, the a-position of 1-phenylethanol (17) was smoothly deuterated in the absence of NaOD ([2H]17 (run 1), 95% D). Because the system is under neutral conditions, deuterium was not incorporated at the b-position (<3% D). This high a/b-selectivity was not achieved under basic conditions (conditions II, [2H]17 (run 2), a: 63% D, b: 65% D) as in the case of previously reported catalysts. The presence of a cyclopropyl group was tolerated, indicating that radical generation is not involved.29 Poorly soluble substrates could also be deuterated by prolonging the reaction time.\nNext, this method was extended to synthesize several pharmaceutically relevant deuterated alcohols (Fig. 2C). 2,4- Dichlorobenzyl alcohol (rapidosept, 22, a preservative) was deuterated selectively at the a-position. Tyrosol ([2H]23) underwent deuteration at both a- and b-carbons. Guaifenesin (24) and diprophylline (25) were deuterated at the a-position of the hydroxyl groups together with partial deuteration at other moieties. The results shown in Fig. 2A C demonstrate excellent functional-group tolerance in the deuteration of alcohols without the involvement of side reactions such as dehalogenation (10, 11, 19, and 22), reduction (13), or catalyst deactivation (4, 14, and 25).\nIn the case of alcohols bearing a terminal alkyne moiety, deuterium was selectively introduced at the alkyne C(sp) carbon prior to the deuteration of the a-carbons of hydroxyl groups (Fig. 2D). The deuteration of alkynes 26 and 27 proceeded even under neutral conditions. High reactivity for alkyne C(sp)deuteration under neutral conditions would be favourable for the selective deuteration of alkyne-tagged probes for Raman imaging.30,31\nExamples of unsuccessful substrates are also shown in Fig. 2E.

An N,O-aminal structure in didanosine was not compatible under the reaction conditions (Fig. 2E, le). While no a-deuteration of alcohols occurred with kojic acid, tropicamide, chloramphenicol, and proxyphylline, acidic carbons in these molecules were selectively deuterated under these conditions (Fig. 2E, right). In fact, these substrates in Fig. 2D and E underwent the deuteration at the acidic carbons spontaneously under basic conditions in the absence of Ir-1.\nTo better understand the catalytic prole, several mechanistic experiments were conducted. 1H NMR analysis of a mixture of 1-phenylethanol (17) and substoichiometric Ir-1 (20 mol%) in CD3OD aer heating at 60 C for 2 h indicated the presence of Ir bipyridonate complexes and [2H]17 (15% D), together with a trace amount of acetophenone (30) (Fig. S2\u2020 in the ESI). The chemical shis for the observed Ir bipyridonate complexes are very similar to those for Ir-1 and different from those of dihydroxypyridine complex Ir-4, indicating that\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nIr bipyridonate complexes are a resting state in the catalytic cycle.\nAs shown in Fig. 3A and B, kinetic monitoring of the HIE of 1- phenylethanol (17) by Ir-1 (1 mol%) at 80 C under neutral conditions showed a rst-order dependence on both [17]0 and [Ir-1]0 (details are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI\u2020). When 1,2- benzenedimethanol (28) was reacted under these conditions, deuterated lactone [2H]29 was obtained in 10% yield (82% D) in addition to the desired deuterated diol (68% yield, 94% D, Fig. 3C). When optically pure (S)-1-phenylethanol (S/R\u00bc >99 : 1) was deuterated under the neutral conditions, the deuterated product was completely racemized (product S/R \u00bc 50 : 50; remaining alcohol S/R \u00bc >99 : 1, Fig. 3D). These results suggest the formation of a carbonyl intermediate (aldehyde or ketone). The lactonization of 29 is the result of the formation of a monoaldehyde intermediate that undergoes intramolecular cyclization to give a hemiacetal.32 The racemization of (S)-17 is due to\nChem.

This result indicates that (1) 2-propanol acts as a reducing agent toward carbonyl compounds in the presence of Ir-1; (2) the conversion of an iridium hydride\n8748 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 8744\u20138751\nintermediate [Ir\u2013H] into iridium deuteride [Ir\u2013D] with D2O proceeds much faster than the reduction of 4-bromoacetophenone (31) by [Ir\u2013H]. Here again, deuterium incorporation at the b-carbon was less than 5% during this reductive process.\nBased on these mechanistic data, a plausible catalytic cycle of the Ir-catalyzed HIE of alcohols under neutral conditions is shown in Fig. 4. The proposed catalytic cycle involves the generation of D2O-coordinated iridium(III) complex A from Ir-1; bipyridonate-ligand-assisted dehydrogenation resulting in the generation of iridium-hydride species B and carbonyls (aldehydes or ketones); Ir\u2013H/D exchange reaction with D2O to give iridium deuteride C; reduction of carbonyls by the Ir\u2013D species C to give deuterated alcohol and to regenerate iridium species A. The results of our NMR and kinetic studies indicate that (1) the catalytic cycle is mediated by monomeric iridium species, and (2) the resting state is observable complex A. b-Deuteration of alcohols under basic conditions occurs via base-catalyzed enolization of the carbonyl intermediates, but the enolization of ketones can be suppressed under our neutral conditions.\nThis catalytic cycle in Fig. 4 is broadly in line with the experimental results of Fujita et al.22c and the results of DFT calculations on Ir-1-promoted dehydrogenation of alcohols.34,35 To further validate our proposed catalytic cycle, we performed the DFT calculations on the Ir-1-promoted deuteration of 17 to (2H)17 under neutral conditions (Fig. 5, S4, and S5\u2020). Intermediate 1 (IM1) and IM3 are comparably stable. The rst step is the Ir-1-promoted dehydrogenation of alcohol 17 (transition state 1, TS1). In TS1, the O1/H2 and Ir/H3 distances are 1.051 A\u030a and 1.677 A\u030a, respectively, meaning that the H2 migration is almost done at the transition state, whereas the Ir\u2013H3 bond is being formed. The second step is the proton transfer leading to an h2dihydrogen complex IM4 directly (Fig. 5) or mediated by a 1- phenylethanol or water hydrogen-bonding bridge (Fig. S4\u2020). All these routes seem energetically feasible, while the direct pathway (TS2) is slightly preferred over routes with a hydrogen-\nalcohols under neutral conditions.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

TS1 is similar in free energies to the three TSs 2 4 (Fig. S5\u2020). While a detailed comparison of energy changes with experiments is avoided here due to the limited accuracy of computations in energies, the overall free energy changes are mostly consistent with the experimental observations.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nFinally, with a practical preparative method of deuterated losartan [2H]1-K+ in hand, we conducted a preliminary metabolic study using CYP2C9 (Fig. 6). Under non-competitive intermolecular conditions, the deuterated losartan potassium ([2H]1-K+) was metabolized to metabolites E3179(-d1) (aldehyde) and then E3174 (carboxylic acid) with a much lower rate than the protiated analogue 1-K+. This result clearly demonstrates the signicant impact of the deuteration of a-hydrogens in losartan on its metabolic prole and the practical utility of the current synthetic method."

            "text": "In summary, we have discovered the iridium bipyridonatecatalyzed H/D exchange reaction of alcohols. The direct adeuteration protocol is applicable to several functionalized alcohols including pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, a-selective deuteration of secondary alcohols was achieved under neutral conditions. In addition, deuterated losartan potassium was found to be signicantly more stable towards the metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP2C9) than the protiated analogue, demonstrating the importance of a-deuteration. The present iridium-catalyzed H/D exchange reaction opens up a new approach for the synthesis of deuterated organic materials and pharmaceuticals.\nChem.

In the deuteration of 4-methylbenzylalcohol (9) in D2O/1,4-dioxane, the deuteration ratios were 68% (3 h), 89% (5 h), and 93% (7 h) in the absence of 2-propanol whereas the deuteration was slow down in the presence of 2-propanol (10/30 mol%) in a concentration-dependent manner: the deuteration degrees are: 40%/22% (3 h), 63%/38% (5 h) and 96%/66% (7 h), respectively (for details, see the ESI\u2020).
