This problem has captured the attention of epidemiologists, security researchers, social scientists, and more, dating back to Shah and Zaman\u2019s seminal work on rumor centrality (Shah & Zaman, 2011).\nSince then, source inference algorithms have been developed across subject areas, with practitioners often contributing new techniques in domain-specific venues. Additionally, algorithms tend to be problem-specific, with various solutions preferable for different diffusion processes and network topologies. Finally, researchers interested in novel source localization algorithms may not have time to implement a robust battery of alternatives to compare new schemes against the state-of-the-art.\ncosasi provides a standard framework for researchers and practitioners alike to perform graph diffusion source inference. The package implements a number of prominent techniques from literature and provides utilities for estimating the number of sources, partitioning infection subgraphs, and more. Where possible, source identification methods are extended as ranking algorithms for hypothesis comparison. cosasi also offers a benchmark suite, which automatically implements a battery of comparable localization methods applicable to the graph diffusion use case at hand, enabling users to easily evaluate novel techniques against appropriate baselines. Standardization is emphasized; for instance, all source inference methods return a SourceResult object, which provides resources for analyzing, ranking, comparing, and learning more about hypothesized sources and the techniques used.\nMcCabe.

It is common for diffusion processes to invoke formalizations from epidemiology, such as the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model, which can represent information spread, or the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, which can represent dynamics more evocative of viral epidemics. Even when describing metaphorical contagion, such as rumors, it is standard to refer to vertices affected by the spreading process as \u201cinfected.\u201d\nThe infection subgraph \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc61 is the subgraph of \ud835\udc3a induced by the infected vertices at time \ud835\udc61. In the single-source SI model, \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc61 is guaranteed to be connected. A common setting for source localization is to infer \ud835\udc46 from some \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc61. More recently, some techniques have incorporated information from a small set of observers, who record the time at which they become infected (Zhu et al., 2016).\nBroadly speaking, source estimators fall into one of two categories: message-passing algorithms, such as Short-Fat Tree (Zhu & Ying, 2014), or spectral algorithms, such as NETSLEUTH (Prakash et al., 2012). An extensive overview of source localization techniques is provided by Ying & Zhu (2018)."

Here, we enumerate a handful of differences between RPaSDT and cosasi, which we believe make cosasi preferable for user accessibility, scalability, and community contribution:\n\u2022 Presentation: RPaSDT is a GUI toolkit. cosasi is an importable package, with extensive documentation and unit testing.\n\u2022 Benchmarking: RPaSDT does not provide automatic benchmarking, whereas this is a core feature of cosasi.\n\u2022 Multi-Source Capabilities: Multi-source inference in RPaSDT is generally performed by partitioning the infection subgraph and applying single-source algorithms to each partition. cosasi implements this strategy, as well, but also supports \u201cnatural\u201d multisource inference that does not require repurposing single-source techniques.\n\u2022 Estimator Utilities: When extending single-source algorithms to the multi-source regime (as described above), it is generally necessary to specify the number of clusters into which we partition the infection subgraph - that is, the hypothesized number of infection sources. cosasi provides a handful of relevant techniques for estimating this quantity, including the Eigengap heuristic (Von Luxburg, 2007) and Minimum Description Length (Prakash et al., 2012).\n\u2022 Multiple Information Types: Some source inference algorithms require information other than an infection subgraph. For instance, Earliest Infection First relies on a collection\nMcCabe. (2022). cosasi: Graph Diffusion Source Inference in Python. Journal of Open Source Software, 7(80), 4894. https://doi.org/10.21105/ joss.04894.\n2\nof observers, who report the time at which they become infected (Zhu et al., 2016). cosasi provides multiple methods for providing state information to the source inference modules, enabling a wider array of potential localization algorithms.\nWhisper was an earlier, thematically similar web application. The project has been inactive since 2016, the web interface is no longer online, and the underlying library is less feature-rich than cosasi or RPaSDT.\nA recent graph autoencoder-based approach by Ling and colleagues performs maximum a posteriori source estimation using a generative prior over diffusion sources (Ling et al., 2022). The corresponding GitHub repository implements their SL-VAE method, but is not a general-purpose diffusion source localization framework.\nA handful of libraries exist to simulate diffusion processes on complex networks; OONIS (Karczmarczyk et al., 2021), EoN (Miller & Ting, 2019), contagion (McCabe, 2021), EpiModel (Jenness et al., 2018), and NDlib (Rossetti et al., 2018) are examples with tens of thousands of downloads among them. These, however, only address the forward problem (contagion propagation), whereas cosasi is focused on the inverse problem (source inference)."
