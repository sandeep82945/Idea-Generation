    "abstractText": "Genetic hearing loss is the most common hereditary sensorial disorder. Though more than 120 genes associated with deafness have been identified, unveiled causative genes and variants of diverse types of hearing loss remain. Herein, we identified a novel nonsense homozygous variant in CEP250 (c.3511C>T; p.Gln1171Ter) among the family members with progressive moderate sensorineural hearing loss in nonsyndromic autosomal recessive type but without retinal degeneration. CEP250 encodes C-Nap1 protein belonging to the CEP protein family, comprising 30 proteins that play roles in centrosome aggregation and cell cycle progression. The nonsense variant in CEP250 led to the early truncating protein of C-Nap1, which hindered centrosome localization; heterologous expression of CEP250 (c.3511C>T) in NIH3T3 cells within cilia expression condition revealed that the truncating C-Nap1 (p.Gln1171Ter) was not localized at the centrosome but was dispersed in the cytosol. In the murine adult cochlea, Cep250 was expressed in the inner and outer hair cells. Knockout mice of Cep250 showed significant hair cell degeneration and progressive hearing loss in auditory brainstem response. In conclusion, a nonsense variant in CEP250 results in a deficit of centrosome localization and hair cell degeneration in the cochlea, which is associated with the progression of hearing loss in humans and mice.",

            "text": "Hereditary hearing loss is the most common sensorial disease worldwide [1]. In half of the congenital hearing loss cases, the cause is genetic defects, two-thirds of which are classified as nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) [2]. To date, more than 120 genes associated with NSHL have been found and more than 400 syndromic disorders have been identified (http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/, accessed on 1 June 2023). Over the past decade, whole-exome sequencing (WES) has been used to identify pathogenic genetic variants that cause hearing loss [3,4] and to discover many novel deafness genes [3,5,6]. However, there are still cases of hearing loss inheritance in which the genetic causes have\nCells 2023, 12, 2328. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12182328 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\nCells 2023, 12, 2328 2 of 13\nnot been identified, indicating that there remain unveiled genetic causes of hearing loss that need to be clarified. CEP250 encodes the C-Nap1 protein that belongs to the CEP protein family, which includes more than 30 proteins that form active centrosomal components and play important roles in centrosome aggregation and cell cycle progression [7,8]. C-Nap1 is expressed in photoreceptor cilia and interacts with other ciliary proteins, including Rootletin and NEK2 [9]. A study on retinal cilia formation in ARPE19 cells reported that CEP250 is involved in cilia formation [10]. It is known that nonsense mutations in CEP250 cause atypical Usher syndrome, characterized by early onset sensorineural hearing loss and relatively mild retinitis pigmentosa (RP) [11,12]. Furthermore, some nonsense variants in CEP250 are associated with only mild cone dystrophy and late-onset sensorineural hearing loss [13,14]. One study reported that missense variants in CEP250 are associated with nonsyndromic RP, indicating that the phenotype varies depending on the type and severity of variations in CEP250 [10]. Herein, we report, for the first time, that a novel nonsense variant of CEP250 was identified in a family with progressive hearing loss but with no ocular symptoms, representative of NSHL. In the present study, we found that the nonsense variant of CEP250 caused the mislocalization of truncated C-Nap1 from the centrosome. In addition, we observed hair cell degeneration and adult-onset progressive hearing loss in Cep250 knockout mice, which is consistent with human data."

All patients registered in the YUHL cohort had hearing loss and were referred to Severance Hospital for further evaluation and treatment, as previously reported [15]. Briefly, pure-tone and speech audiograms were obtained for all patients and their affected and unaffected family members. Pure-tone air (250\u20138000 Hz) and bone conduction (250\u20134000 Hz) thresholds were measured using a clinical audiometer in a double-walled audio booth. The degree of hearing loss was determined by averaging the air-conduction thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The auditory steady-state response was also determined in young babies. Temporal bone computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed to evaluate inner ear abnormalities."

Variant calling detected 32,912 variants. After removing variants with a count of less than 3 or a frequency of less than 25, 19,567 variants remained. After excluding variants that were previously reported in the Deafness Variation Database (https://deafnessvariationdatabase.org/, accessed on 10 July 2023) or ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/, accessed on 10 July 2023) or had been determined as benign in the YUHL cohort, 5224 variants remained. Of the total, 641 variants were identified as non-synonymous or obligatory splice site variants. According to the expert-specified American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guideline [18], we chose rare variants with allele frequencies below 0.005 based on total or East Asian data in the genome aggregation database (gnomAD), resulting in 388 variants. Given the autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance observed in the proband, we focused on 33 variants that were suspected to be homozygous or compound-heterozygous. We examined these variants using the Integrative Genomics Viewer and excluded variants with potential false alignments or poor sequence quality. Additionally, two variants located in cis, which were inherited from one of the parents, were also excluded. Subsequently, nine variants in six genes remained (Supplementary\nCells 2023, 12, 2328 3 of 13\nTable S1). Finally, the remaining variants were ranked based on the following criteria: whether mutations were truncating the conceptual reading frame (non-sense, frameshift, and obligatory splice variants), the results of an evolutionary conservation analysis of missense variants, and predictions of the potential disease impact of candidate variants on the encoded protein using web-based programs. Additionally, known disease-causing mutations were considered in the ranking process. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database analysis revealed that among the six remaining genes, CEP250 was the only gene associated with cone-rod dystrophy and hearing loss, thus establishing its potential causative role."

All affected individuals had normal visual acuity without night blindness.

            "text": "In this study, we report, for the first time, that a homozygous nonsense variant of CEP250 causes NSHL with autosomal recessive inheritance in humans. The novel variant CEP250 c.3511C>T; p.Gln1171Ter was associated with slowly progressive sensorineural hearing loss, but was not related to ocular phenotypes such as cone-rod dystrophy or RP. In a subsequent molecular study, we found that the nonsense variant does not induce nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA, but is well translated into the protein; however, the CEP250 protein failed to localize in the centrosome. Using Cep250 knockout mice, Cep250 was broadly expressed in hair cells and ganglion neurons. Without Cep250, the outer hair cells degenerate, and subsequently, auditory thresholds increase with age. Data from both humans and mice support that Cep250 plays an important role in maintaining hair cell function and survival in the cochlea during the postnatal period. To date, there have been five reports on the association between CEP250 pathogenic variants and atypical Usher syndrome or nonsyndromic RP [10\u201314]. Usher\u2019s syndrome is associated with sensorineural hearing loss and RP [27]. Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1) causes congenital severe-to-profound hearing loss with vestibular dysfunction and early onset RP (first decade of life). Usher syndrome type II (USH2) is characterized by moderate congenital hearing loss without vestibular dysfunction and relatively late-onset RP (second decade of life). In Usher type III, progressive sensorineural hearing loss begins after speech development and varying degrees of RP and vestibular dysfunction are present [28\u201331]. Atypical Usher syndrome comprises those cases of Usher syndrome that cannot be categorized into the other three types (I, II, and III). Several studies have reported that ultra-rare variants of the causative genes are associated with atypical Usher syndrome. For instance, MYO7A, USH2A, CDH23, USH1G, CEP250, CEP78, ADGRV1, ARSG, ABHD12, and ESPN are associated with the atypical phenotypes of Usher syndrome [32]. The presence of an atypical phenotype indicates that Usher syndrome is a spectral disease with variable severity and multi-organ phenotypes. In this regard, the phenotype of patients with variants of CEP250 may vary depending on the severity of damage to individual variants of CEP250. This speculation is in line with evidence that the severity of RP is dependent on the type of nonsense variants in CEP250 and that a missense variant in CEP250 is relevant to only the nonsyndromic RP [10,13,14]. In our study, patients with the CEP250 p.Gln1171Ter variant did not have any ocular phenotype, but only had auditory phenotypes, such as progressive sensorineural hearing loss (i.e., NSHL). The ages of the affected individuals in this study ranged from the late 30 s to the early 40s, which is older than that reported previously for atypical Usher syndrome caused by variants in CEP250 [32]. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that retinal degeneration begins at a later age. According to the literature, Cep250 knockout mice do not show visual phenotype at the ages of 3 and 6 months while their visual responses decrease at 12 and 20 months [33,34]. These findings support that visual phenotype may be age-dependent, and long-term follow-up is necessary. In the present study, we did not perform the test of visual response in the knockout mice. Two reports on Cep250 knockout mice used the same knockout allele, which was generated by the deletion of exon 6 and 7, resulting in the early truncation of the 178 amino acid protein [33,34]. In our mice, we deleted exons 3\u201312 resulting in the early truncation of the 77 amino acid protein. As both strains generated a very early truncation of the protein and deleted exons 6 and 7, which are critical for Cep250 activity, we consider these two strains to be functionally equivalent in terms of Cep250 loss-of-function; thus, we expect that our knockout mice would also show a similar pattern in visual phenotype. To determine whether the variant found in the patients shows a visual phenotype in a mouse model, it is needed to create a humanized knockin mouse model with the same variant as that found in the patients. This model would produce an early truncating protein of approximately 1171 amino acids, roughly half the size of the wild type CEP250 protein. As such, generating a knockin mice model and following its electroretinogram are warranted to delve deeper into investigating the pathologic mechanisms of the variant about retinal degeneration.\nCells 2023, 12, 2328 11 of 13\nMost pathogenic variants of CEP250 are nonsense recessive variants, indicating that early truncation of CEP250 results in loss of function. CEP250 mediates centriole cohesion, which is important for cilia development [35]. When we overexpressed WT CEP250 in NIH3T3 cells, ciliary development was normal (Figure 3). This finding indicated that the role of CEP250 in ciliary development may be redundant. This postulation is consistent with the late-onset and relatively mild phenotype of atypical Usher syndrome or nonsyndromic RP of hearing loss caused by variants in CEP250. Given that the onset of hearing loss occurs in adulthood, CEP250 in the cochlea may be involved in the maintenance of hair cell structure and function, but not in the developmental stage. In our study, the nonsense variant did not undergo nonsense-mediated decay having vulnerable and easily degradable mRNAs. The nonsense variant mRNA (CEP250 c.3511C>T) was successfully translated, but the protein failed to localize in the centrosome (Figure 2). However, early truncation of CEP250 did not affect ciliary elongation (Figure 3), indicating that the variant leads to loss of function but not gain of function. How the loss of function of CEP250 causes hair cell degeneration and leads to progressive hearing loss remains unclear. There are several possible explanations for this. First, given that CEP250 plays a role in centrosome formation and ciliary development by interacting with Rootletin and NEK2 [9,10], loss of function of CEP250 may cause defects in cellular proliferation and migration, which results in an unstable subcellular structure of hair cells, consequently causing progressive hearing loss. Second, an unknown function of CEP250 in hair cells may be required to maintain hair cell function and survival. CEP250 was abundantly expressed in hair cells and spiral ganglions (Figure 4). Without CEP250, it appears that the outer hair cells gradually degenerate, which could be either primary or secondary. These data suggest that CEP250 is critical for hair cell survival. Unfortunately, the present study does not provide the experimental data about whether primary cilia and centrosome are affected or not in the hair cells of Cep250 knockout mice. Therefore, mechanistic investigation about defects in primary cilia and mislocalization of the centrosome would be helpful to elucidate the differential functions of CEP250 in hair cells in future studies."
