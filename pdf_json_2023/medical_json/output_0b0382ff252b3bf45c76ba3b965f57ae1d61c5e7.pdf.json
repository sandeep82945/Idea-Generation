The psychological and social characteristics of residents strongly determine housing needs and preferences. They also depend on economic, spatial, technical, and cultural factors. The Covid-19 pandemic, which humankind had been experiencing for two years, influenced all spheres of human life, especially inhabitation. The functional program of homes has changed, as well as public spaces, transportation and social ties. While the future is uncertain, the many changes provoked by the pandemic might become irreversible. This paper aims to present how the phenomena mentioned above have influenced the housing environment and residential preferences and trends that may follow. A survey conducted among Cracow residents in Autumn 2021 revealed a significant shift in lifestyles that corresponded with the change in residential needs, preferences and attitudes towards the housing environment. Working from home has induced redefining the use of particular rooms/spaces. For safety, families attempted to reorganize the entrance zone. Outdoor public spaces have become more appreciated following the trend of healthier everyday life. Over the long term, the pandemic experience may significantly influence the residential market. housing environment, Covid pandemic, residential needs and preferences"

            "text": "Much research has already been done on the Covid19 pandemic and the various social and psychological problems associated with it, presented in scientific publications (Graziani et al., 2022; Al-Hussein et al., 2022; Moon & Jo, 2022; Stecu\u0142a, & Wolniak, 2022; Pfledderer et al. 2022; Paridanset al., 2022). However, the Covid-19 pandemic has also forced us to reconsider how we live and erect our dwellings. Several months (or more) of being confined to the space of one\u2019s apartment has attracted attention to the unpredictable conditions of living and functioning in cities. Many inhabitants realized that the residential space at their disposal did not meet the conditions of the new expanded functional program, and that public\nspace did not meet their expectations1. In response, new ideas concerning buildings, interiors and public spaces: temporary, light theatre, concert or exhibition halls, more flexible apartment interiors and mixed-use public spaces, have emerged. Some of these already outlined trends can gain permanence due to changes in lifestyle, while others may evolve due to changing environmental conditions. It is thus worth exploring which projects and of what housing environment elements could change and what this change might be based on. In terms of residential buildings and dwelling interiors, certain new solutions can be identified, such as2: 1Architects reveal the impact of Covid-19 on housing design, https://www.showhouse.co.uk/news/architects-reveal-the-impactof-covid-19-on-housing-design/, (accessed: 15.05.2022) 26 Ways COVID-19 Will Change Home Design, https://architizer.com/blog/inspiration/industry/covid-19-homedesign/, (accessed: 15.05.2022).\nJournal homepage:\nwww.remv-journal.com\nREAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND VALUATION - vol. 31, no. 2, 2023 eISSN: 2300-5289 | Received 2022-06-16 | Revised 2022-09-22 | Accepted 2022-09-27 19\n1. A shift towards flexible dwelling plans: during the pandemic, the range of activities performed at home increased. Should this tendency gain permanence, open-plan apartments (which are easier to arrange) will become more desirable to buyers. 2. The need for private external space: inhabitants have become sensitized to the value of nature and contact with it. In housing design, we can observe a pursuit to integrate external space with dwelling interiors, i.e., using roof gardens, micro-courtyards, verandas and balconies (Kang K. 2020). 3. New home office forms: remote work is an attractive form of employment for a sizeable segment of professionals and has become the standard in many occupations. The demand for functional private offices that would become an integral part of the home and the linking of home offices with private external spaces, where offices may be situated as well, was observed to increase. 4. Disinfection in entrance zones: for homes to become safe and clean, entrance zones must become isolated passage spaces where one can take off one\u2019s shoes and coat and disinfect their hands before entering a house/apartment. 5. Smart kitchen design: spending a greater amount of time at home has led to a rise in the significance of kitchens. Due to hygienic considerations, the kitchen space can absorb innovative technologies, such as voice-activated appliances. Decreased frequency of shopping trips may lead to storage space being in greater demand. 6. Air purification systems: inhabitants may pay greater attention to the air quality at home, and limit the amount of unfiltered air from the outside.\nNew proposals also pertain to the design of cities and settlement systems. Some of the present trends may have long term effects on how we design cities. During the pandemic, large office buildings and skyscrapers in business districts became deserted. Now, when many employees continue to work remotely, companies redefine their need for office space, which may result in the necessity for the adaptive reuse of office buildings. The necessity to erect temporary vaccination facilities or hospitals led to new methods of adapting existing spaces and\nincreased interest in modular construction.3 Public spaces are an important resource in crisis situations. The decrease in traffic led to an improvement in air quality and freed up many attractive spaces that had previously been occupied by vehicles. Proposals of streets and squares becoming shared spaces for pedestrian and vehicular traffic developed, which enhanced and functionally enriched city centers. More attention was directed towards better integrating the system of public spaces: streets, squares, and the careful design and provision of spaces for a diverse range of activities across various scales. Proposals for mobile playgrounds, meeting spaces or small markets were developed (Charrouk, 2021). The role of public spaces as a place for the integration of local communities, supporting the excluded and offering aid, became more prominent,4 especially as up to 30.9% of British adults (7.4 million people) reported a feeling of \u201csolitude in isolation\u201d (Office of National Statistics, Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, April 3 to May 3, 2020) (Bugg, 2020)."

Current studies on the quality of the housing environment focus on three fields. The first concerns the impact of the quality of the housing environment on inhabitant wellbeing, assuming that wellbeing is the most important element of the quality of life. The second field focuses on the study of the housing environment\u2019s qualitative features in the context of their perception and acceptance by users. The third discusses the link between the quality of the housing environment and the prices of apartments on the market (Alkay, 2009).\nThe notion of the housing environment is inseparably tied with its quality and attributes that can express this quality as precisely as possible. The problem with the precise formulation of a universal definition of the housing environment is that the housing environment always exists in a specific, 38 Ways COVID-19 Will Change Architecture, https://architizer.com/blog/inspiration/industry/covid19-citydesign/,(accessed: 15.05.2022). 412 Key Principles for an Effective Urban Response during COVID19https://www.archdaily.com/961166/12-key-principles-for-aneffective-urban-response-during-covid-19, (accessed: 15.05.2022).\nREAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND VALUATION - vol. 31, no. 2, 2023 eISSN: 2300-5289 | \u00a9 2023 The Author(s) | Article under the CC BY license 20\nunique natural, economic and social setting. It is inhabited by people who belong to a specific society, who represent various social, professional and religious groups. The interweaving factors that define the individual character of a housing environment are highly complex, and measures of habitation (and housing environment) quality cannot be applied to the same settlement every time (Jansen et al., 2011). Thus, the question as to what constitutes the quality of the housing environment can perhaps never be definitively answered. Along with changing environmental conditions, certain attributes of the home and its surroundings can shift in importance, and new, essential elements of housing environment quality may appear (Vajiranivesa, 2010). It is worth noting that housing conditions expected by potential house and apartment buyers5 remain closely tied with the perception and assessment of previous conditions. The features that describe a given housing property should thus be analyzed and assessed in parallel to studying the aspirations and expectations of potential buyers.\nChanges in the hierarchy of importance of housing environment features that took place as a result of the experience of the Covid-19 pandemic are an illustration of this argument.\nIn academic publications, we can encounter various prognoses of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated social distancing on the perception of the housing environment and how it is shaped. For instance, post-pandemic architecture was discussed in \u201cArchitecture after coronavirus.\u201d (Priday, 2020). An extensive review, presented in \u201cAntivirus-built environment: Lessons learned from COVID-19 pandemic\u201d (Megahed, & Ghoneim, 2020) presents the deep spatial changes that pandemics cause in developed spaces, including housing. \u201cDeterminants of Residential Preferences Related to Built and Social Environments and Concordance between Neighbourhood Characteristics and Preferences\u201d (Liet al., 2020), as well as \u201cWho is Your Preferred Neighbour? Partisan Residential Preferences and Neighbourhood Satisfaction\u201d (Hui, 2013) complement the subject in the context of relations that affect housing preferences, neighborhood characteristics, and social spaces in the built environment. A review of sustainability aspects in relation to Covid-19 has been presented in \u201cThe problem of change in sustainability requirements.\u201d (Tokazhanovet al., 2020).

Proof of links between procedures associated with the design of the urban environment and the risk of infection is presented (Lai et al., 2020).\nThe literature also features dramatic visions of architectural failure in the face of Covid-19. Such a threat can be found in \u201cHow Architecture Fails in Conditions of Crisis: a Discussion on the Value of Interior Design over the COVID-19 Outbreak.\u201d (Rassia, 2020) Albeit this being an extreme view, changes are undoubtedly observable and the previous attractiveness of living in the city and the desire to function in a community, which remain uncontested, have begun to coexist with smart-working. Covid-19 has become a decisive argument in favor of working from home. We can read about home spaces adapted into offices in \u201cHome Office Spaces for Smart Work. Impact of Covid-19 Lockdown on Arrangements of Residential Interiors.\u201d (Bonenberg & Lucchini, 2021). The smart-working trend is followed by academic studies on the quality of space in apartment interiors in terms of spending time dedicated to work there. Many such studies focused on factors that directly contributed to inhabitant health, such as \u201cHealthy workplaces: What we know and what else we need to know.\u201d (Jensen, & van der Voordt, 2019). They also include studies that discuss microclimate conditions such as comfort in relation to humidity, (Psomas et al., 2021)light (Hafezparast Moadab et al., 2021) or acoustics (Szczepa\u0144ska et al., 2020). The impact of apartments on our health was also discussed in \u201cHow our homes impact our health: Using a COVID-19 informed approach to examine urban apartment housing Archnet-IJAR.\u201d (Peters & Halleran, 2020).\nThe effects of the pandemic and home isolation are visible in human behaviors, which creates an extensive field for academic research and thus to expanding the relevant literature. Here we can mention \u201cLiterature Review.

            "text": "In recent years, the Polish housing market has enjoyed stable development. Low mortgage interest rates, rising wages and consumer affluence levels have all led to a gradual improvement of Poles\u2019 housing standards and living conditions. However, relative to\nthe wealthiest European countries, these conditions still leave much to be desired. Among persons seeking to buy an apartment, the most popular option on the market are two-room dwellings, as 39% of respondents declared the desire to purchase such a unit. The most popular size in terms of floor area that was seen as acceptable was 30\u201339 m2. Preferences concerning the number of rooms change much slower than the acceptable floor area. As prices on the market grew, it became clear that clients were becoming increasingly prone to accepting smaller dwellings while retaining preferences concerning the number of rooms. In the case of all apartment types, apart from studios, there was an observable decrease in minimal acceptable floor area of dwellings (Table 2). This change was the most pronounced in 2021.\nThe most often sought dwellings depending on buyer type have been presented in Table 1.\nThe maximum budget available to all groups of buyers increased substantially in all of the cities under study in 2021. In Warsaw, it increased by 12% on average, and in Krakow it increased by 18%. Rising prices meant that one had to pay more for their dwelling. The proportions between the share of buyers who intended to take out a loan in relation to those who planned to purchase a property for cash remained stable over the past several years. In the group classified as investors, cash purchases were declared by 64% of respondents. In the other groups, this share was around 40%. Cash purchases mostly applied to the smallest dwellings \u2013 the larger the unit, the more often its purchase was supported by a mortgage, including in the investor group6.\nFactors that affect the housing market and are within its environment recently led to an increase in prices, a lower availability of loans and thus redefined housing preferences. Based on the latest data on 6 https://stat.gov.pl/obszary-tematyczne/infrastruktura-komunalnanieruchomosci/nieruchomosci-budynki-infrastrukturakomunalna/obrot-nieruchomosciami-w-2021-roku,8,5.html.\npotential apartment buyers, an attempt was made to determine the impact of the pandemic and the parallel dynamic increase in property prices on Poles\u2019 purchasing decisions. It can be argued that the pandemic and the associated experience of isolation and necessity of spending time at home would lead to increased interest in larger dwellings that would feature a workspace or training space. Meanwhile, data collected by Obido7 indicate that residents\u2019 preferences are mostly shaped (and modified by) rising housing prices and their relation to wages, and thus their credit score. Potential apartment buyers in 2021 did not raise their expectations concerning the preferred number of rooms, but displayed greater flexibility in terms of the preferred minimum floor area, whose preferred value showed a downward trend across all local markets. However, a segment of 7 The data on preferences among potential buyers were obtained by Obido.pl. Those who are interested in purchasing an apartment and use the website to browse offers must fill out a survey in which they define their preferences concerning a potential apartment, as well as demographic data.

Such clients, who previously sought apartments in cities, showed greater interest in suburban properties with potentially larger floor areas."

            "heading": "4. Empirical results: Impact of the pandemic on housing needs and preferences",
            "text": "The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the perception of individual elements of the housing environment, taking action towards transforming its elements (primarily apartment layouts) and changes in housing preferences as an effect of changes in working and lifestyle behaviors of its residents as forced by the pandemic. It is important to note that persons who did not search for a house/apartment also participated in the study: most respondents did not plan to move to a new dwelling before the pandemic. In the light of the necessity to shape a sustainable housing environment and enhance its quality, it appears crucial to monitor the needs and preferences of this population segment as well. The study was performed on a sample of 393 respondents (286 women and 107 men), of which 125 were below 18 years of age (high-school students). A total of 41.5 respondents reported having a universitylevel education, with a similar number of respondents reporting still being a student (high school, university student). The majority of respondents \u2013 64.4% \u2013 inhabited cities with populations above 100 thousand, while 26% resided in the country. Almost half of the respondents (49.5%) declared living in multi-family buildings, while 45.3% declared living in single-family houses. During the pandemic, the subjects either shared their dwellings with loved ones: members of the immediate family or partners (93.1%) or lived alone (6.9%). As the main method for presenting the data, we used percentages of answers on the survey, with a breakdown by women and men whenever appropriate.\nMost of the respondents (69%) declared that the pandemic substantially changed their working conditions; 56% of the respondents stated they worked remotely. This means that at least one work station was generated in their house/apartment \u2013 consisting of a separate room (rooms) or dedicated\nenclaves within existing spaces that also functioned in other ways. On average, there were more such workstations in a statistical house or apartment. The percentage of respondents who had their own workspace (a room to work in) was 28.7%, and over half of the respondents used a workstation organized in an otherwise non-working space (51.4%). A fifth of the respondents who were employed / active students did not have such a workstation. Figure 1 shows that men used workstations in dedicated spaces (workspaces), while over half of the female respondents used a workstation in a non-working space. Table 2 presents how the form of the dwelling (multi-family building versus a single-family house) affected workstation organization strategies in the residential space. Both in single-family houses and in multi-family buildings, the most widespread form of workstation organization was a station (a desk or table) in the living room, bedroom or hall. In most cases, they were used by the youngest respondents: school and university students. In single-family houses, it was more common to dedicate a separate space to working. Such spaces were used by 36.8% of residents of single-family houses and 20% of apartment owners in multi-family residential buildings and tenement houses. These respondents represented the segment that exceeded 35 years of age. The results of the survey also showed that people who had a dedicated workstation in a non-working space wanted to have their own separate space (60.3%). Meanwhile, respondents who did not have a dedicated workstation or workspace did not report such a desire.\nAccess to a dedicated workstation versus the housing development type inhabited is presented in Table 2. The respondents were also asked whether they had intended to move or alter their current residential space before the Covid-19 pandemic. Only 18.4% of respondents declared a desire to move to a different apartment, with a similar percentage (16.8%) striving to enlarge their apartment floor area. Changes in the functional layout were planned by 18.4%, while obtaining an additional space at the cost of walling a balcony or loggia was explored by only 4.1% of respondents. It can be concluded that the housing situation and condition of the respondents were stable and satisfactory.\nJournal homepage:\nwww.remv-journal.com\nREAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND VALUATION - vol. 31, no. 2, 2023 eISSN: 2300-5289 | Received 2022-06-16 | Revised 2022-09-22 | Accepted 2022-09-27 23\nTable 2\nAccess to a dedicated workstation versus the type of housing\nDedicated workstation or workspace in a house/flat\nForm of housing/Type of development Multi-family Single-family Overall N % N % N %\nI have a dedicated workspace for remote work/learning (e.g., a study) 37 20,00 75 36,76 112 28,79 I have a dedicated workstation for remote work/learning (e.g., a desk in the bedroom or\nliving room) 100 54.05 98 48.04 198 50.90\nOverall 185 100.00 204 100.00 389 100.00 Source: Original work based on survey results.\nFig. 1.Workstations in a single-family house/apartment. Source: Original work based on survey results.\nThe pandemic brought significant changes in the way that households function. The list of activities engaged in by the residents of a house/apartment expanded, and the time they spent at home increased. In many cases, previous functio-spatial linkages in an apartment ceased to play their part. The survey results clearly showed a need for change in spatial organization as a result of these changes in lifestyle. It must be noted that the observed lifestyle changes were only partially initiated by the pandemic; some had emerged earlier as a result of the popularization of a healthy lifestyle, a rise in affluence or regard for the natural environment, and were merely strengthened as a result of the pandemic. The concept of work\u2013life balance may have potentially been reinforced, as it loosens previously rigid working hours and places where it is performed. As a result of changes to work organization during the pandemic, some professions could be practiced solely inremote form. One change that was certainly hastened by the pandemic was acceptance of remote work and the apartment as a place of work. At present, 18.1% of respondents were significantly more inclined to\nworking from home, while 34.1% were slightly more inclined to do so in comparison to the situation before the pandemic. Almost half of the respondents (47.8%) declared that they were reluctant to work remotely from home. An analysis of correlation between remote work performance and the desire for change in housing condition indicated that switching to remote work was tied with a desire to section off a permanent workspace inside the home and to increase the number of rooms in the dwelling.\nRemote work from home made recreational spaces near one\u2019s place of residence more accessible, and these were visited more frequently. During the pandemic, 62.8% of people used green and recreational areas (women did so more frequently than men). The mobility of Poles also increased. Almost half of the respondents (44.8%) declared they organized trips into attractive tourism sites more often, while 48.3% of respondents increased their physical activity and started paying more attention to their health, either slightly or substantially. These tendencies did not apply to the entire population, and\nREAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND VALUATION - vol. 31, no. 2, 2023 eISSN: 2300-5289 | \u00a9 2023 The Author(s) | Article under the CC BY license 24\nthe phenomena above showed a negative correlation with increased respondent age.\nLifestyle changes were found to have a considerable impact on the perception and assessment of housing environment features and on defining priorities in this respect. This argument was given credibility by respondent opinions concerning the rating of importance of selected house/apartment features (Fig. 2). Pro-environmental and eco-friendly solutions (materials and technologies that, for instance, save energy and water) were found to be a necessary feature by 28.6% of respondents. Only 7.6% of respondents declared such features insignificant.\nHigh indoor climate quality: insolation, crossventilation, and air and water purification were reported to be necessary by 34% of respondents (they were deemed insignificant by only 3.6% of the subjects). A similar rating distribution concerned acoustic comfort. These are all attributes of a sustainable housing environment, which the respondents treated as currently necessary standard elements. It must be stressed that as little as ten years prior, pro-environmental technical and technological solutions were rated as too costly for the average housing market consumer to afford.\nThe respondents were asked about changes to their house/apartment they would be likely to currently apply in the light of having experienced the pandemic. The assessment of selected features of residential space was performed on the following scale: necessary, very important, important, insignificant. A third of the respondents planned to move to a different dwelling; this was rated as \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d by 12.0% of respondents and as \u201cvery important\u201d by 9.2%. The percentage of respondents who declared a desire to change their place of residence increased from 18.4% to 21.2% due to the pandemic. The desire to change one\u2019s place of residence was voiced more prevalently by residents of multi-family buildings rather than single-family houses. Concurrently, 37.6% of respondents would expand the floor area of their apartment (\u201cnecessary\u201d\nto 8.1%) at the cost of a loggia, balcony or terrace. A tenth of the subjects would increase the number of rooms in their apartment at the cost of open spaces. A desire to expand floor area at the cost of a loggia and balcony and increase the number of rooms was more prevalent in the case of respondents who had such plans before the pandemic. The respondents attached high significance to having an apartment with a layout that allows for a dedicated workspace (which is necessary for 33.8% of respondents) and arranging a spacious entrance zone where one could change (essential for 30.8%). A desire to organize an entire dedicated workspace was declared more often by women than men. Age was a variable with a negative correlation here: the older a respondent was, the less likely they were to declare such a functional change desirable (Spearman rho: -0.19, p < 0.01).\nJournal homepage:\nwww.remv-journal.com\nREAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND VALUATION - vol. 31, no. 2, 2023 eISSN: 2300-5289 | Received 2022-06-16 | Revised 2022-09-22 | Accepted 2022-09-27 25\nFig. 3. Changes in relations between neighbors during the pandemic. Source: Original work based on survey results.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the functioning of society, local communities and neighborhood groups. A sense of being threatened by a potential infection with the virus from other people and a change in the routine organization of everyday life altered how neighborhood communities functioned. The results of the survey show that neighbors were not treated as a potential source of infection: only 2.8% of respondents saw them as a serious cause of concern due to posing a potential source of viral infection, with 15.3% of respondents\ndeclaring being \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned about being infected. The respondents also gave their opinions on changes in relations with neighbors during the pandemic. Most subjects did not observe any change in relations with neighbors; in the opinion of only 7.1%, such relations improved significantly, while 26.5% declared them as being slightly better (women rated these relations more positively than men). However, a greater willingness to help was observed. A declaration that a neighborhood community fostered mutual aid during the pandemic was made\nREAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND VALUATION - vol. 31, no. 2, 2023 eISSN: 2300-5289 | \u00a9 2023 The Author(s) | Article under the CC BY license 26\nby 12.5% of respondents (a great deal of aid \u2013 12.5%, a small deal of aid \u2013 46.1%). Women were also more inclined to offer such help than men. Senior and disabled members of the community were also given greater attention. No significant increase in caregiving was observed, meaning that most respondents retained their professional responsibilities (by working remotely) and cared for children or elderly family members. New forms of neighbor cooperation were not reported to carry over to greater friendship or stable social contact. Only a third of cases resulted in this, while in 5.6% of cases they became significant (Fig. 3)."

Over the long-term, the pandemic experience can affect both changes in lifestyle and \u2013 indirectly \u2013 the concept of housing and the relation between residents and the housing environment (Fig. 4).\nThis argument finds confirmation in the results of the presented survey study. The results indicate that changes in lifestyle that became visible in Poland prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic became more prevalent among younger segments of the population and among the residents of large cities. The threat to life and health contributed to a significant part of Poles starting to adopt a healthy lifestyle that included physical activity and tourist trips. The respondents also declared more frequent use of\ngreen and recreational areas near their residences. This tendency is highly beneficial from the standpoint of housing environment quality: joint use of semiprivate, semi-public and public space has an integrating effect on citizens and facilitates entering into relations and building bonds, and thus creates a higher quality of housing.

The normalization of the epidemic will certainly contribute to a return to social behaviors from before. However, the experience of the neighborhood community\u2019s alternative functioning and the bonds which had already formed create a potential and opportunity for change. The results of the study also showed a rise in expectations concerning eco-friendly solutions used in dwellings, such as environmentally friendly materials and technologies, along with a high-quality indoor climate: insolation, cross-ventilation, air and water purification.\nDuring the pandemic, the space of the apartment/home was transformed due to the necessity of arranging workstation(s) for remote work. In around a half of apartments, this function was served by a desk/table that occupied a fragment of a space that had a different use. Wherever a dwelling\u2019s floor area allowed for it, a dedicated work space was arranged. Around a quarter of the respondents did not have a permanent place for remote work/learning, and it always had a mobile character. Remote working contributed to respondents valuing the possession of a separate space to work in. The role of a wellorganized entrance zone (that allows for changing) also grew. A flexible functional layout also placed highly on the list of important apartment features. This means that the previous zoning of functional enclaves does not solve potential conflicts between an apartment\u2019s functions.\nThe realities of the housing market: the interplay of supply and demand, the purchasing power of house and apartment buyers, will be defined by decisions concerning floor area, location and furnishings of a new dwelling for a long time. The evolution of housing needs, the hierarchy of importance concerning expected features, and an individual\u2019s lifestyle and values will modify the market offering. The findings presented show that there are indications of a gradual improvement of the housing environment."
