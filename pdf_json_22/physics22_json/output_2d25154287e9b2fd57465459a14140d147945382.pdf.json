    "abstractText": "This paper systematically studied heat transfer through two transversely coupled qubits in contact with two types of heat reservoirs. One is the independent heat reservoir which essentially interacts with only a single qubit, the other is the common heat reservoir which is allowed to simultaneously interact with two qubits. Compared to independent heat reservoirs, common reservoirs always suppress heat current in most cases. However, the common environment could enhance heat current, if the dissipation rate corresponding to the higher eigenfrequency is significantly higher than that corresponding to the lower eigenfrequency. In particular, in the case of resonant coupling of two qubits and the proper dissipations, the steady state can be decomposed into a stationary dark state which doesn\u2019t evolve and contributes zero heat current, and a residual steady state which corresponds to the maximal heat current. This dark state enables us to control steady-state heat current with an external control field and design a thermal modulator. In addition, we find that inverse heat currents could be present in the dissipative subchannels between the system and reservoirs, which interprets the suppression roles of common heat reservoirs. We also calculate the concurrence of assistance (COA) of the system and find that heat current and COA have the same trend with temperature, which further indicates that entanglement can be regarded as a resource to regulate heat transport.",

            "text": "Thermodynamics, one of the pillars of physics, has been widely investigated since its\nbirth [1, 2]. With the rapid development of quantum mechanics [3, 4], thermodynamics\nat the quantum level has attracted increasing interest [4\u20138]. For example, Otto cycles\n[9,10], Carnot engines [11\u201313], Brownian motions [14,15], four laws of thermodynamics\n[16\u201318], entropy increasing principle [19\u201322] and so on are widely studied, which deepens\nour understanding of the thermodynamical laws down to the quantum level [23\u201325] and\nprovides us with the potential to constructively use quantum features to exploit quantum\nthermal devices that can manipulate the microscopic energy flow.\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n14 05\n0v 3\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\nIn recent years, various quantum thermal devices based on versatile systems\nhave been proposed such as quantum engine and refrigerator [26\u201330], quantum\nthermometers [31,32], thermal rectifier [33] and switch [34,35], thermal diode [36\u201339] and\ntransistor [40\u201348] and so on. Experimental advances have also been made continuously\n[20, 29, 49\u201355], thermodynamic devices at the quantum level using superconducting\nqubits, quantum dots, cavity QED, circuit QED, and other systems have been realized.\nMost cases address the individual component of a system only interacting with an\nindependent heat reservoir (IHR) but a common heat reservoir (CHR) could produce\ninteresting effects like increasing entanglement etc [56\u201362]. In addition, two-dimensional\nmaterials have also been rapidly developed due to the various features, such as high\nmobility, band gap tunability, super-large specific surface area, and so on [63\u201365]. In\nparticular, graphene [66\u201368] has good thermal conductivity and the thermal relaxation is\nalso studied in cavity-coupled graphene with a Johnson noise read-out [69]. In this sense,\nthe heat current through the single layer could be greatly affected by the transverse\ncoupling between the components (e.g., a layer of graphene molecules).\nIn this paper, we consider a simple model consisting of two transversely coupled\ntwo-level atoms (TLAs) commonly contacting two heat reservoirs as shown in figure 1.\nWe systematically consider and compare all four cases, including whether or not there\nexists the transverse coupling and whether or not the two TLAs are coupled with the\ncommon heat reservoirs. Using the Born-Markov-secular (BMS) master equation, we\nfind that the transverse coupling between the two TLAs reduces the heat currents despite\nCHRs or IHRs. It is found that CHR can enhance or suppress the heat currents (HCs),\nwhich depends on the practical scenario such as the decay rates, the atomic coupling, the\ntemperature, etc. In particular, we show that if two TLAs are resonantly coupled with\neach other with the same dissipation rates, the system\u2019s steady state is a mixture of two\nstates: one is a \u2019dark state\u2019 that does not evolve and is decisive with zero HC; the other\nis a steady state leading to the maximum HC. The \u2019dark state\u2019 enables us to design a\nquantum thermal modulator that can continuously control the desired steady-state HC\nby an external driving laser. In addition, the dissipation channels between CHRs and\natoms are divided into direct dissipation channels (DDCs) and cross dissipation channels\n(CDCs). We find that inverse currents [70] are generated in CDCs for detuned coupling\nand both CDC and DDC for resonant coupling. It also gives an interpretation of the\nsuppression effects of the CHRs. Besides, we also study the concurrence of assistance\n(COA) [71,72] in the system, which indicates that HC and COA keep a similar variation\ntrend with the changing reservoir temperatures.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we introduce the physical\nmodel of two transversely coupled TLAs contacting two CHRs and derive the BMS\nmaster equation of the dynamic process. In section 3 and section 4, we give the\nexpressions of steady-state HCs with detuned coupled TLAs and resonantly coupled\nTLAs, respectively. In section 5, we studied the \u2019dark state\u2019 of the system and designed\na thermal modulator. In section 6, we present HCs in different dissipation channels\nand discuss the presence of inverse currents. In section 7, steady-state COA and HC\nare analyzed. Section 8 gives a summary of this paper. Some detailed derivations and\ntedious expressions are shown in the appendices."

The Hamiltonian H of the system can be written as (kB = \u210f = 1)\nH = HS +HE +HSE, (1)\nwhere\nHS = \u03c91 2 \u03c3z1 + \u03c92 2 \u03c3z2 + g\u03c3 x 1\u03c3 x 2 (2)\nis the Hamiltonian of the two interacting TLAs with \u03c3zm = |e\u27e9m\u27e8e| \u2212 |g\u27e9m\u27e8g|, m = 1, 2. Here we don\u2019t apply the rotational wave approximation and hence take the X-X type interaction with \u03c3xm = |e\u27e9m\u27e8g| + |g\u27e9m\u27e8e|. We assume that all reservoirs are composed of harmonic oscillators with infinite degrees of freedom, so the Hamiltonian HE of the environment (heat reservoirs) reads\nHE = \u2211 j \u03c9Lja \u2020 jaj + \u2211 k \u03c9Rkb \u2020 kbk, (3)\nwhere \u03c9Lj (\u03c9Rk) represents the transition frequency of the jth mode of reservoir L (the kth mode of reservoir R) and a \u2020 j and aj (b \u2020 k and bk) are the corresponding creation and annihilation operators. The interaction HSE between the system and the reservoirs is\nHSE = 2\u2211\nm=1 [ \u2211 j fLmj(a \u2020 j + aj) + \u2211 k fRmk(b \u2020 k + bk)]\u03c3 x m, (4)\nwhere fLmj (or f R mk) denotes the coupling strength between the mth atom and the jth (or kth) mode of thermal reservoir L (or R), respectively. To describe the system\u2019s dynamics, we\u2019d like to rewrite the Hamiltonian H in HS representation. The Hamiltonian HS is a diagonalized matrix in its own representation\nas HS = \u22114 l=1 \u03bbl|l\u27e9l\u27e8l|, where\n[\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4] = [\u2212\u0393s,\u2212\u0393d,\u0393d,\u0393s] (5)\nis the eigenvalue with \u0393\u03bd = \u221a \u03c92\u03bd + g 2, \u03bd = s, d, and \u03c9s or \u03c9d is the sum or difference between the natural frequencies of two TLA, i.e., \u03c9s = 1 2 (\u03c91 +\u03c92) and \u03c9d = 1 2 (\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92), and\n|1\u27e9 = \u2212 sin \u03b8s| \u2191\u2191\u27e9+ cos \u03b8s| \u2193\u2193\u27e9, |2\u27e9 = \u2212 sin \u03b8d| \u2191\u2193\u27e9+ cos \u03b8d| \u2193\u2191\u27e9, (6) |3\u27e9 = cos \u03b8d| \u2191\u2193\u27e9+ sin \u03b8d| \u2193\u2191\u27e9, |4\u27e9 = cos \u03b8s| \u2191\u2191\u27e9+ sin \u03b8s| \u2193\u2193\u27e9, (7)\ndenote the corresponding eigenstates, with sin \u03b8\u03bd = g\u221a (\u0393\u03bd+\u03c9\u03bd)2+g2 , | \u2191\u2191\u27e9 = | \u2191\u27e91 \u2297 | \u2191\u27e92, | \u2191\u27e9m = ( 10 ) and | \u2193\u27e9m = ( 01 ). The operators \u03c3xm in HS representation is converted to the eigenoperators Vm(\u03c9m\u00b5) as\nV1(\u03c911) =sin \u03b8+(|3\u27e9\u27e84| \u2212 |1\u27e9\u27e82|), \u03c911 = \u03c9\u2212, (8) V1(\u03c912) =cos \u03b8+(|1\u27e9\u27e83|+ |2\u27e9\u27e84|), \u03c912 = \u03c9+, (9) V2(\u03c921) =cos \u03b8\u2212(|1\u27e9\u27e82|+ |3\u27e9\u27e84|), \u03c921 = \u03c9\u2212, (10) V2(\u03c922) =sin \u03b8\u2212(|1\u27e9\u27e83| \u2212 |2\u27e9\u27e84|), \u03c922 = \u03c9+, (11)\nwhere \u03b8\u00b1 = \u03b8d \u00b1 \u03b8s and \u03c9m\u00b5, \u00b5 = 1, 2, are the eigenfrequencies with \u03c9\u00b1 = \u0393s \u00b1 \u0393d. It is easily checked that the eigenoperators satisfy the commutation relations [HS, Vm(\u03c9m\u00b5)] = \u2212\u03c9m\u00b5Vm(\u03c9m\u00b5) and [HS, V \u2020m(\u03c9m\u00b5)] = \u03c9m\u00b5V \u2020m(\u03c9m\u00b5). Thus the interaction Hamiltonian HSE can also be rewritten as\nH\u0303SE = 2\u2211\nm=1 [ \u2211 j fLmj(a \u2020 j + aj) + \u2211 k fRmk(b \u2020 k + bk)]\u00d7 \u2211 i=\u00b1 [V \u2020m(\u03c9i) + Vm(\u03c9i)], (12)\nand the total Hamiltonian H reads\nH = 4\u2211\nl=1\n\u03bbl|l\u27e9l\u27e8l|+HE + H\u0303SE. (13)\nWith the Hamiltonian equation (13), we employ the Born-Markov-secular\napproximation to derive the global master equation which describes the dynamic\nevolution of an open system [73]. The details of the derivation are given in appendix A.\nIn the interaction picture, the master equation governing the evolution of the reduced\ndensity matrix \u03c1 of the system can be written as\n\u03c1\u0307 = LL(\u03c1) + LR(\u03c1), (14)\nwhere L\u03b1(\u03c1), \u03b1 = L,R denotes the dissipators of the left or the right thermal reservoirs and\nL\u03b1(\u03c1) = L11\u03b1 (\u03c1) + L22\u03b1 (\u03c1) + L12\u03b1 (\u03c1) + L21\u03b1 (\u03c1), (15)\nwith Lmn\u03b1 (\u03c1) = \u2211 i=\u00b1 Jmn\u03b1 (\u2212\u03c9i)[2Vn(\u03c9i)\u03c1V \u2020m(\u03c9i)\u2212 V \u2020m(\u03c9i)Vn(\u03c9i)\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1V \u2020m(\u03c9i)Vn(\u03c9i)\n+ Jmn\u03b1 (\u03c9i)[2V \u2020 n (\u03c9i)\u03c1Vm(\u03c9i)\u2212 Vm(\u03c9i)V \u2020n (\u03c9i)\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1Vm(\u03c9i)V \u2020n (\u03c9i)]. (16)\nHere Jmn\u03b1 (\u00b1\u03c9i) = \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9i)[\u00b1n\u0304\u03b1(\u00b1\u03c9i)] is the spectral density, \u03b3mnL/R(\u03c9i) = \u03c0f\nL/R mj/k(\u03c9i)f L/R nj/k(\u03c9i) is the dissipation rate and the average photon number of the ith\nmode for reservoir \u03b1 is denoted by n\u0304\u03b1(\u03c9i) = 1\ne \u03c9i T\u03b1 \u22121\nwith temperature T\u03b1. It should be\nnoted that Lmn\u03b1 (\u03c1) denotes the direct (m = n) or crossing (m \u0338= n) dissipations induced by the mth atom or two atoms with the \u03b1th heat reservoir. In particular, the CHR effect is indicated by the crossing dissipations. If CHR is not considered, Lmn\u03b1 (\u03c1) = 0, which will reduce to the case of IHRs, namely, each atom is only coupled to its own two\nreservoirs (L and R), in which case we let the heat reservoirs with the same subscript\n(L or R) be of the same temperature for the sake of comparison. So the corresponding\nmaster equation also can be formally given as equation (14) (the detailed derivation is\nin appendix B), but the difference is\nL\u03b1(\u03c1) = L11\u03b1 (\u03c1) + L22\u03b1 (\u03c1), (17)\nwhich has no crossing dissipations.\nIn the case of CHR, if the two atoms aren\u2019t coupled to each other, the eigenoperator\nVm(\u03c9mm) = 0 due to sin \u03b8\u00b1 = 0, so only one eigenoperator is left for each atom with the corresponding eigenfrequency \u03c91, \u03c92, and the master equation is given as equations (14,17) for \u03c91 \u0338= \u03c92 due to the secular approximation. It is worth mentioning that there will be crossing dissipations for \u03c91 = \u03c92, in which case the master equation is given as equations (14,15). The explicit derivation is provided in appendix B.\nIf neither the two-atomic coupling nor the effects of CHRs are considered, the model\nis reduced to two independent open systems, describing a two-level atom connected to\ntwo heat reservoirs of different temperatures. In this case, the master equation is of the same form as equations (14,17) with Vm = |\u2193\u27e9m\u27e8\u2191| and the eigenfrequency \u03c9m. The derivation process is also given in appendix B."

(21)\nOne can check that the rank of matrix MC is 3, so the unique solution of equation (18), i.e., the steady state can be obtained as\n\u03f1Cii = 4\u2211\nk,l=1 j=5\u2212i\n|\u03f5ijkl| (Mki +Mkj)MliMjl, i \u2208 [1, 4], (22)\nwhere Mpq = \u2211\n\u03b1M pq \u03b1 as given in equation (19) and \u03f5ijkl is 4-dimensional Levi-Civita\nsymbol.\nWith the above steady-state density matrix, we can calculate the heat currents by\nthe expression [17,74]\nQ\u0307\u03b1 = Tr[HSL\u03b1(\u03c1S)] = \u27e8\u03bb|M\u03b1|\u03c1S\u27e9, (23)\nwhere |\u03bb\u27e9 is a column vector consisting of the eigenvalues ofHS. Substituting the current system into equation (23), we have\nQ\u0307C\u03b1 = \u03c9\u2212 NC [(M21\u03b1 \u03f1 C 22 +M 43 \u03b1 \u03f1 C 44)\u2212 (M12\u03b1 \u03f1C11 +M34\u03b1 \u03f1C33)]\n+ \u03c9+ NC [(M31\u03b1 \u03f1 C 33 +M 42 \u03b1 \u03f1 C 44)\u2212 (M13\u03b1 \u03f1C11 +M24\u03b1 \u03f1C22)]. (24)\nIf we don\u2019t consider the coupling between atoms, the above HC in equation (24) for \u03c91 \u0338= \u03c92 will become\nQ\u0307C\u2032\u03b1 = 2\u2211\nm=1\n\u03c9m J m\u2212 \u03b1 J m+ \u2212 Jm+\u03b1 Jm\u2212\nJm+ + Jm\u2212 , (25)\nwhere Jm\u00b1 = \u2211\n\u03b1 J m\u00b1 \u03b1 , m = 1, 2 with J m\u00b1 \u03b1 = \u22122Jmm\u03b1 (\u00b1\u03c9m) and the prime denotes the\nphysical quantity in the case of decoupled TLAs. Here we have to emphasize that the\ncase with \u03c91 = \u03c92 will be left in the latter. Now let\u2019s first address the IHRs, in which case the cross dissipation Lmn\u03b1 (m \u0338= n) won\u2019t be considered. Thus the steady-state density matrix vector as |\u03f1I\u27e9 = 1 NI [\u03f1I11, \u03f1 I 22, \u03f1 I 33, \u03f1 I 44] T , N I = \u22114 p=1 \u03f1 I pp, satisfy MI |\u03f1I\u27e9 = 0 with the coefficient matrix\nMI\u03b1 = ( M1 \u2212M3 \u2212M1 M3 ) \u2297 12 + 12 \u2297 ( M2 \u2212M4 \u2212M2 M4 ) , (26)\nwhere superscript I stands for IHR, 12 denotes 2-dimensional identity matrix and Mp = \u2211\n\u03b1M p \u03b1 with\nM1\u03b1 =M 1 \u03b1(\u03c9\u2212) = \u22122[sin2 \u03b8+J11\u03b1 (\u03c9\u2212) + cos2 \u03b8\u2212J22\u03b1 (\u03c9\u2212)], M3\u03b1 =M1\u03b1(\u2212\u03c9\u2212), M2\u03b1 =M 2 \u03b1(\u03c9+) = \u22122[cos2 \u03b8+J11\u03b1 (\u03c9+) + sin2 \u03b8\u2212J22\u03b1 (\u03c9+)], M4\u03b1 =M2\u03b1(\u2212\u03c9+). (27)\nDue to the ignored crossing dissipation in the current case, all the parameters in equation (27) is related to those in equation (19) as M12\u03b1 = M 34 \u03b1 = M 1 \u03b1, M 13 \u03b1 = M 24 \u03b1 = M 2 \u03b1, M21\u03b1 = M 43 \u03b1 = M 3 \u03b1 and M 31 \u03b1 = M 42 \u03b1 = M 4 \u03b1. Therefore, the steady state can be given in a simple form as\n\u03f1I11 =M 3M4, \u03f1I22 =M 1M4, \u03f1I33 =M 2M3, \u03f1I44 =M 1M2, (28)\nand the heat currents given in equation (23) can also be simplified as\nQ\u0307I\u03b1 = \u03c9\u2212 N I [M3\u03b1(\u03f1 I 22 + \u03f1 I 44)\u2212M1\u03b1(\u03f1I11 + \u03f1I33)]\n+ \u03c9+ N I [M4\u03b1(\u03f1 I 33 + \u03f1 I 44)\u2212M2\u03b1(\u03f1I11 + \u03f1I22)]. (29)\nIf we don\u2019t consider the coupling between atoms in the case of IHRs, the steady-\nstate HC can be given in a simple form as Q\u0307I\u2032\u03b1 = Q\u0307 C\u2032 \u03b1 since the two atoms with different intrinsic frequency connected to CHR don\u2019t produce crossing dissipation when g = 0,\nwhich is consistent with the case of IHR. It is obvious that the HC for \u03c91 = \u03c92 = \u03c9 reads Q\u0307\u2032\u03b1 = 2\u03c9 J++J\u2212 [J\u2212\u03b1J + \u2212 J+\u03b1J\u2212] with J\u00b1 = \u2211 \u03b1 J \u00b1 \u03b1 and J m\u00b1 \u03b1 = J \u00b1 \u03b1 for m = 1, 2.\nIt is necessary to mention here that when the dissipation rate meets \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) = \u03b3i,\nthe two coupled TLSs connect to IHRs or CHRs will get the same steady state, namely,\nequations (22,28) are identical. The specific form of the steady state is given in appendix C. In figure 2, we investigate the relationship between HCs Q\u0307L = \u2212Q\u0307R and steady-state populations \u03f1ii, and we find that populations of two levels with higher (or lower) energy\nalways have the same change, increasing (decreasing) with the increase of g in figure 2(a)\nand decreasing (increasing) with the increase of TL in figure 2(b). It also can be found that the heat currents for both CHRs and IHRs increase with the decrease (increase) of\nthe populations of \u03f111 and \u03f122 (\u03f133 and \u03f144).\nTo provide an intuitive illustration of the influence of the CHRs and the atomic\ncoupling, we plot the HCs Q\u0307L in figure 3 and figure 4 with various settings. Here we only consider the detuning coupling between atoms with the fixed frequency, e.g., \u03c91 \u0338= \u03c92. It is easy to find from figures 3(a), 3(b), 4(a) and 4(b) that the HCs in both CHRs and IHRs\nbecome enlarged with the increasing frequency \u03c92 and \u03b3i or with the decreasing atomic coupling g. In particular, it can be seen that the HCs with CHRs are always slightly\nsmaller than the HCs with the IHRs in figure 3(a) and figure 3(b), and the more intuitive\nillustrations are shown in figure 3(c) and figure 3(d), which indicate the difference of HC\nfor the steady state between the two types environments. Such suppression effects of\nCHRs, corresponding to \u2206Q\u0307 < 0 at TL < TR and \u2206Q\u0307 > 0 at TL > TR, are kept, but the maximum suppression occurs when the two atoms are near resonance, i.e., \u03c91 \u2248 \u03c92, or the interatomic coupling g is near the super-strong coupling, i.e., g \u223c \u03c9m. Note that our numerical research indicates that the most potent suppression effect doesn\u2019t lie at the\nexact resonant coupling but in the region near the resonant coupling. The HCs in both\nCHRs and IHRs will be equal and reach the maximum if the two atoms are decoupled.\nIn figure 3(b), we use the red plus and red square lines to represent the steady-state HC\nwhen the uncoupled atoms connect IHR and CHR directly. Obviously, it is consistent\nwith equation (24) by directly putting g = 0.\nIn addition, we find that in some cases the CHR can play the enhancement role as\nshown in figure 4, where \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) = \u03b3i denotes the dissipation rates corresponding to the same eigenfrequency \u03c9i. In figures 4(c), 4(d), and 4(e), we fix the natural frequency of two atoms at \u03c91 = 3 and \u03c92 = 4 and mark \u2206Q\u0307L < 0 and \u2206Q\u0307L > 0 with white and black dashed lines, respectively. For the case of the fixed \u03b3+ corresponding to the frequency \u03c9+, the enhancement effect of CHR is only shown in the region at the lower half plane of zero contours as shown in figure 4(c). However, when \u03b3\u2212 is fixed in figure 4(d), the part corresponding to the lower half plane of the zero contours shows the\nsuppression effect of CHR. Figure 4(e) provides a clear picture of how \u2206Q\u0307L is affected by two dissipation rates corresponding to different transitions. We found that when\n\u03b3\u2212 > 0.42\u03b3+, CHR always suppresses HC, on the contrary, HC is enhanced. It is clear that \u2206Q\u0307L is directly proportional to \u03b3\u00b1 in figure 4(e). The reason is that the steady state of the system is independent not only of the type of heat reservoir but also of the dissipation rate between the system and the heat reservoir for \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) = \u03b3i, as shown in equations (C.1,...,C.4). And it is proved that the effect of CHR is always suppressed\nunder the condition \u03b3\u2212 = \u03b3+ = \u03b3. What\u2019s more, for resonantly coupled atoms, the set of \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) will directly change the steady-state properties of the system, as explained in the next section."

            "text": "Now we consider the resonant coupling of the two atoms, i.e., \u03c91 = \u03c92 = \u03c9. One can find that the resonant or detuning coupling between atoms only affects the case of CHR, so\nwe won\u2019t consider the case of IHR in this section. Without loss of generality, we consider\nthe dissipation rate inconsistencies between the two atoms and the corresponding IHRs, i.e., \u03b311\u03b1 (\u03c9i) \u0338= \u03b322\u03b1 (\u03c9i). In the case of resonant coupling, the diagonalized Hamiltonian can be expressed as HS = \u22114 l=1 \u03bbl|l\u27e9l\u27e8l|, where\n[\u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4] = [\u2212 \u221a \u03c92 + g2,\u2212g, g, \u221a \u03c92 + g2] (30)\nis the eigenvalue, and\n|1\u27e9 = \u2212 sin \u03b8| \u2191\u2191\u27e9+ cos \u03b8| \u2193\u2193\u27e9, (31)\n|2\\3\u27e9 = \u2213 1\u221a 2 | \u2191\u2193\u27e9+ 1\u221a 2 | \u2193\u2191\u27e9, (32)\n|4\u27e9 = cos \u03b8| \u2191\u2191\u27e9+ sin \u03b8| \u2193\u2193\u27e9, (33)\ndenote the corresponding eigenstates with sin \u03b8 = g\u221a ( \u221a \u03c92+g2+\u03c9)2+g2 . The eigenoperators Vm(\u03c9m\u00b5) can be given as\nV1\\2(\u03c9\u2212) = sin\u03d5(|3\u27e9\u27e84| \u2213 |1\u27e9\u27e82|), (34) V1\\2(\u03c9+) = cos\u03d5(|1\u27e9\u27e83| \u00b1 |2\u27e9\u27e84|), (35)\nwhere \u03d5 = \u03b8 + \u03c0 4 and \u03c9\u00b1 =\n\u221a \u03c92 + g2 \u00b1 g. It can be found that in the current case\nsin\u03d5 = sin \u03b8+ = cos \u03b8\u2212 and cos\u03d5 = sin \u03b8\u2212 = cos \u03b8+. Following a similar process as the detuning case, one can obtain the corresponding master equation and the steady\nstate, which are anastomotic with equations (14,15,22). Similarly, one can also get the\nsteady-state HC in the form of equation (24) but all the relevant parameters are given by equations (30,\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 35). If the coupling between the TLAs isn\u2019t considered in the case of CHR, one will find\nthe merging of the previous eigenoperators leads to the great change of the master\nequation which is explicitly derived for the same dissipation frequency \u03c9 in appendix B.\nBecause of the secular approximation, two uncoupled atoms also have cross dissipation with the same heat reservoir. In the representation {|1\u27e9 , |2\u27e9 , |3\u27e9 , |4\u27e9} with |1\u27e9 = |\u2193\u2193\u27e9, |2\u27e9 = 1\n2 (|\u2193\u2191\u27e9 \u2212 |\u2191\u2193\u27e9), |3\u27e9 = 1 2 (|\u2191\u2193\u27e9 + |\u2193\u2191\u27e9) and |4\u27e9 = |\u2191\u2191\u27e9, we can solve the steady-\nstate density matrix as the same form as equation (22) but the parameters therein have to be replaced by M12 =M24 = M1, M13 =M34 = M2, M21 =M42 = M3 and\nM31 =M43 = M4 with Mp = \u2211\n\u03b1M p \u03b1 and M1\\2\u03b1 = \u2212[ \u221a J11\u03b1 (\u03c9)\u2213 \u221a J22\u03b1 (\u03c9)] 2,\nM3\\4\u03b1 = \u2212[ \u221a J11\u03b1 (\u2212\u03c9)\u2213 \u221a J22\u03b1 (\u2212\u03c9)]2. (36)\nAnalogously, the HC in the current case with g = 0 has also the same form as equation\n(24) with the renewed parameters and \u03c9\u00b1 = \u03c9.\nAs mentioned above, no matter whether the two resonant TLAs are coupled to\neach other or not, we always obtain the steady state as well as the HCs with the same\nform, even though their values are different. This implies the similarity of the behaviors\nof HCs in the two cases. To verify this conclusion, we also make the numerical test as\ndone in figures 3 and 4. Our numerical research reveals that the HCs of the system\nversus various parameters indicate completely similar behaviors as figures 3 and 4 for \u03b311\u03b1 (\u03c9i) \u0338= \u03b322\u03b1 (\u03c9i). That is, the CHR has a similar contribution to both the resonance and the detuning of the two TLAs. In this sense, we don\u2019t repeatedly provide the figures\nwhich are much analogous to figures 3 and 4. However, it is important for the resonant case that the consistent dissipation rates \u03b311\u03b1 (\u03c9i) = \u03b3 22 \u03b1 (\u03c9i) can show quite interesting results.\nNow let\u2019s turn to the consistent dissipation rates, i.e., \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) = \u03b3i. We\u2019d like to\nmake further simplicity as \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) = \u03b3, which doesn\u2019t change the physics. In this case, the dissipators become much simpler as\nL\u03b1(\u03c1) = \u2211 i=\u00b1 J\u03b1(\u2212\u03c9i)[2Vi\u03c1V \u2020i \u2212 V \u2020 i Vi\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1V \u2020 i Vi]\n+ J\u03b1(\u03c9i)[2V \u2020 i \u03c1Vi \u2212 ViV \u2020 i \u03c1\u2212 \u03c1ViV \u2020 i ], (37)\nwhere V\u2212 = 2 sin\u03d5|3\u27e9\u27e84| = \u22112 m=1 Vm(\u03c9\u2212) and V+ = 2 cos\u03d5|1\u27e9\u27e83| = \u22112 m=1 Vm(\u03c9+). It is clear that transitions 1 \u2194 2 corresponding to eigenfrequency \u03c9\u2212 and 2 \u2194 4 corresponding to eigenfrequency \u03c9+ do not exist, which also indirectly means that the dynamic evolution of the system will be independent of the second level under the special condition of \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) = \u03b3. In addition, the matrix MC in equation (18) governing the dynamics is also simplified as M\u0303C = \u2211 \u03b1 M\u0303 C \u03b1 with\nM\u0303C\u03b1 =  M\u03031\u03b1 0 \u2212M\u03032\u03b1 0 0 0 0 0\n\u2212M\u03031\u03b1 0 M\u03032\u03b1 + M\u03033\u03b1 \u2212M\u03034\u03b1 0 0 \u2212M\u03033\u03b1 M\u03034\u03b1  and\nM\u03031\\2\u03b1 = \u22128 cos2 \u03d5J\u03b1(\u00b1\u03c9+), M\u03033\\4\u03b1 = \u22128 sin2 \u03d5J\u03b1(\u00b1\u03c9\u2212). (38)\nA simple calculation shows that M\u0303C is rank 2, which means that the steady state subject\nto equation (18) is not unique. The general solution can be expressed as\n|\u03c1\u0303C\u27e9 = \u03c122|\u03c1\u0303C1 \u27e9+ (1\u2212 \u03c122)|\u03c1\u0303C2 \u27e9, (39)\nwhere the steady-state density vector |\u03c1\u0303C1 \u27e9 = [0, 1, 0, 0]T and |\u03c1\u0303C2 \u27e9 = 1 N\u0303C [M\u03032M\u03034, 0, M\u03031M\u03034, M\u03031M\u03033]T , N\u0303C = M\u03032M\u03034 + M\u03031M\u03034 + M\u03031M\u03033. It is clear that the steady state of the system is the mixture of two states |\u03c1\u0303C1 \u27e9 and |\u03c1\u0303C2 \u27e9. Thus the HC can be given as \u02d9\u0303QC\u03b1 = \u02d9\u0303QC,max\u03b1 (1\u2212 \u03c122) with\n\u02d9\u0303QC,max\u03b1 = \u03c9\u2212M\u0303\n1\nN\u0303C (M\u03034\u03b1M\u0303\n3 \u2212 M\u03033\u03b1M\u03034) + \u03c9+M\u0303\n4\nN\u0303C (M\u03032\u03b1M\u0303 1 \u2212 M\u03031\u03b1M\u03032). (40)\nThe state |\u03c1\u0303C1 \u27e9 is a \u2019dark state\u2019 independent of time and directly affects HCs. In addition, one can find that the HC \u02d9\u0303QC\u03b1 decreases with \u03c122 increasing and \u02d9\u0303QC\u03b1 = 0 if \u03c122 = 1. In this case, the steady state |\u03c1\u0303C\u27e9 = |\u03c1\u0303C1 \u27e9 in the original bare representation spanned by {|\u2191\u2191\u27e9, |\u2191\u2193\u27e9, |\u2193\u2191\u27e9, |\u2193\u2193\u27e9} is given by \u03c1 = |\u03c8\u27e9 \u27e8\u03c8| with |\u03c8\u27e9 = 1\u221a\n2 (|\u2193\u2191\u27e9 \u2212 |\u2191\u2193\u27e9). When \u03c122 = 0, the\ncorresponding steady state is \u2019residual state\u2019 |\u03c1\u0303C2 \u27e9 and the HC will reach the maximal value as \u02d9\u0303QC,max.\nIn the case of uncoupled TLAs with \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9) = \u03b3, M C \u03b1 can be further simplified to\nMC\u2032\u03b1 with\nM\u0303C\u2032\u03b1 =  2J+\u03b1 0 \u22122J\u2212\u03b1 0 0 0 0 0\n\u22122J+\u03b1 0 2J+\u03b1 + 2J\u2212\u03b1 \u22122J\u2212\u03b1 0 0 \u22122J+\u03b1 2J\u2212\u03b1  . Similarly, one can find that the rank of M\u0303C\u2032 is 2, that is, the steady-state density matrix don\u2019t have unique form and the vector form can be given as |\u03c1\u0303C\u2032\u27e9 = \u03c122|\u03c1\u0303C\u20321 \u27e9 + (1 \u2212 \u03c122)|\u03c1\u0303C\u20322 \u27e9, where the two steady states with the vector forms as |\u03c1\u0303C\u20321 \u27e9 = [0, 1, 0, 0]T and |\u03c1\u0303C\u20322 \u27e9 = 1N\u0303C\u2032 [J \u22122, 0,J\u2212J+,J+ 2 ] with N\u0303C\u2032 = J\u22122 + J\u2212J+ + J+2. Thus, one can also get the HC in this case as \u02d9\u0303QC\u2032\u03b1 = \u02d9\u0303QC\u2032,max\u03b1 (1\u2212 \u03c122), where\n\u02d9\u0303QC\u2032,max\u03b1 = 2 \u03c9\nN\u0303C\u2032 (J+ + J\u2212)(J\u2212\u03b1J + \u2212 J+\u03b1J\u2212). (41)\nExplicitly, equation (41) is consistent with equation (40) subject to g = 0.\nUp to now, we have shown that for the resonant coupled TLAs with consistent\ndissipation rates as \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) = \u03b3i, the steady state of the system is not unique, which explicitly depends on the population of the second energy level \u03c122 regardless of the coupling between atoms. It is obvious that HC through the system varies from 0 to\nmaximum with \u03c122 changing from 1 to 0. This provides us with the potential to control HCs by the \u03c122."

            "text": "From previous sections, one can find that the steady state of the system in the HS representation is directly related to the population \u03c122 since |\u03c11\u27e9 does not evolve with time. Therefore, once \u03c122 is determined, the HC of the system is determined. In particular, the HC can be changed from 0 to some maximal value with the change of\n\u03c122. In this sense, the HC can be effectively controlled by the population \u03c122. Thus our system can act as a thermal modulator. Next, we will give a detailed demonstration.\nLet\u2019s consider a laser field resonantly driving the second and another (e.g. the\nthird) energy levels. The evolution of the system is given in appendix D, from which\none can obtain the evolution equations of the populations as\n\u03c133(t) = A\u2212\n2 cos(\u2126Rt) +\nA+\n2 , (42)\n\u03c122(t) = \u2212 A\u2212\n2 cos(\u2126Rt) +\nA+\n2 , (43)\nwhere A\u00b1 = \u03c133(0)\u00b1 \u03c122(0), \u03c122(0) and \u03c133(0) denote the populations of the second and the third levels of the initial state. It can be found that \u03c122(t) and \u03c133(t) harmonically oscillate with time. Therefore, the population \u03c122 can be controlled by the evolution time. As an example, let\u2019s look at figure 5. The system is in the steady state at the initial\nmoment t0 = 0 by setting \u03c122 = 1 and other elements of the density matrix are zero, and it corresponds to the minimum HC Q\u0307\u03b1 = 0, which means no heat exchanged between the two heat reservoirs. At t1, we add a laser with frequency \u03bd23 and Rabi frequency \u2126R = 0.5\u03c0. After the interaction time \u2206t1, one gets \u03c122 = 0.7. Let the system evolve freely; it finally reaches the steady state with the HC 0.3 times the maximum value. At\nthe moment t2, we let the laser drive the second and the third energy levels \u2206t2 time, then \u03c122 = 0.3. After the free evolution for enough time, the steady-state HC becomes 0.7 times the maximum value. Then, we repeat the process; one can obtain \u03c122 = 0 by imposing the same laser for \u2206t3 time at the moment t3. The maximum HC can be obtained when the system reaches a steady state again. One can also decrease the\nHC by adjusting the laser driving time. But there is a little difference in the process of\ndecreasing HC. Since \u03c122 doesn\u2019t evolve with time, the population \u03c122 = 1 can be reduced to \u03c122 = 0 by transferring the population to \u03c133. In this way, the HC can increase from zero to maximum. However, because \u03c111, \u03c133 and \u03c144 are not independent of each other in the steady state, in order to increase the population of \u03c122 from zero to 1, we have to transfer all the other populations including \u03c111, \u03c133 and \u03c144 to \u03c122. All the transferring processes can be similarly controlled by imposing the corresponding resonantly driving\nlaser field. As shown in figure 5, at the moment t4, we adjust \u03c122 = 0.2 by adding the driving laser with \u2206t4 interaction time. After free evolution for enough time, the HC becomes 80% of the maximum value. One can also obtain \u03c122 = 0.4 at the moment t5 by adding the laser for \u2206t5 evolution time. In the steady state, HC becomes 0.6 times the maximum value. The HC between the heat reservoirs can be controlled by repeating\nthis process from the maximum to zero."

            "text": "To better understand the effects of the CHRs, in the following we will focus on the HCs\nsubject to different dissipation subchannels. Due to the second law of thermodynamics, we know that the thermodynamic process must obey the entropy increase rate S\u0307 =\u2211 i FiJi \u2265 0, where Fi and Ji represent the thermodynamic force and the corresponding current, respectively [17,19]. The generated current must be forward with the same sign\nas the corresponding thermodynamic force for a system with a single thermodynamic\nforce. However, no specific rule requires that the current generated by the corresponding\nforce must be a forward current in multiple thermodynamic force systems, as long as\nthe resultant entropy increase rate is more significant than zero. A recent paper shows\nthat inverse flow can be achieved by adjusting the temperature difference or chemical\npotential difference between the heat reservoirs to disturb the system\u2019s equilibrium in\na one-dimensional gas model consisting of two species interacting particles in contact\nwith two heat reservoirs [70]. Our system will find that the inverse heat current (IHC)\ncan be generated if each thermodynamic force is considered a dissipative channel (DC).\nAccording to the master equation (14), we find that the dissipation of the system can\nbe divided into direct dissipation and cross dissipation. In this sense, we can divide the\nDCs of each heat reservoir into the direct dissipative channels (DDC) and the crossing\ndissipative channels (CDC). Since HC satisfies additivity, we can separately discuss the\ndirect heat current (DHC), the crossing heat current (CHC), and the total heat current\n(THC). Let\u2019s first consider the case of section 3. The matrix MC can be expressed as MC = Md + Mc, where d and c denote the part of direct and crossing dissipations. Based on the definition of HC given in equation (23), Md andMc can directly determine\nthe corresponding DHC and CHC, which can be explicitly given as\nQ\u0307d\u03b1 = \u03c9\u2212 NC [M3\u03b1(\u03f1 C 22 + \u03f1 C 44)\u2212M1\u03b1(\u03f1C11 + \u03f1C33)]\n+ \u03c9+ NC [M4\u03b1(\u03f1 C 33 + \u03f1 C 44)\u2212M2\u03b1(\u03f1C11 + \u03f1C22)], (44)\nQ\u0307c\u03b1 = \u03c9\u2212 NC [\u039e3\u03b1(\u03f1 C 22 \u2212 \u03f1C44)\u2212 \u039e1\u03b1(\u03f1C11 \u2212 \u03f1C33)]\n+ \u03c9+ NC [\u039e4\u03b1(\u03f1 C 33 \u2212 \u03f1C44)\u2212 \u039e2\u03b1(\u03f1C11 \u2212 \u03f1C22)], (45)\nwhere \u039ei = \u2211\n\u03b1=L,R \u039e i \u03b1, \u039e 1 = M1 \u2212 M34 = M12 \u2212M1, \u039e2 = M2 \u2212 M13 = M24 \u2212M2, \u039e3 =M3\u2212M43 = M21\u2212M3 and \u039e4 =M4\u2212M31 = M42\u2212M4. One can easily check that Q\u0307C\u03b1 = Q\u0307 d \u03b1 + Q\u0307 c \u03b1 as given in equation (24). As mentioned in section 3, the steady state of the system for \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9\u00b1) = \u03b3\u00b1 will be independent of the type of the environment. By observing equations (29,44), we find that Q\u0307d\u03b1 = Q\u0307 I \u03b1 and the effect of CHR will only be reflected in the cross dissipation, i.e., Q\u0307c\u03b1.\nTo give an intuitive illustration of the HCs, we plot the HCs with TL in figure 6.\nFigure 6(a) and figure 6(b) show the left and the right HCs in the steady state, where the\nblack dashed, blue solid, and solid red lines, respectively, represent the DHC, CHC, and\nTHC. The backgrounds in these two figures describe the CHC versus TL. Interestingly, the CHC is opposite of the THC. Namely, the inverse heat current is present and inhibits the THC, which also gives a direct interpretation of why Q\u0307C\u03b1 is slightly less than Q\u0307 I \u03b1 in this case.\nSimilarly, in the case of section 4, we can also divide the matrix M\u0303C into direct and\ncross parts and get the expressions of DHCs and CHCs are\n\u02d9\u0303Qd\u03b1 = 1\u2212 \u03c122 2N\u0303C {\u03c9\u2212[M\u03034\u03b1M\u03031M\u03033 \u2212 M\u03033\u03b1M\u03034(M\u03031 + M\u03032)]\u2212 \u03c9+[M\u03031\u03b1M\u03032M\u03034 \u2212 M\u03032\u03b1M\u03031(M\u03034 + M\u03033)]}\n+ \u03c122 2 (\u03c9\u2212M\u0303 4 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9+M\u03031\u03b1), (46)\n\u02d9\u0303Qc\u03b1 = 1\u2212 \u03c122 2N\u0303C {\u03c9\u2212[M\u03034\u03b1M\u03031M\u03033 \u2212 M\u03033\u03b1M\u03034(M\u03031 \u2212 M\u03032)]\u2212 \u03c9+[M\u03031\u03b1M\u03032M\u03034 \u2212 M\u03032\u03b1M\u03031(M\u03034 \u2212 M\u03033)]}\n\u2212 \u03c122 2 (\u03c9\u2212M\u0303 4 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9+M\u03031\u03b1), (47)\nwhere \u03c9\u00b1 = \u221a \u03c92 + g2 \u00b1 g.

Since the steady-state HC is\nnot unique, we only consider the maximum HC here. The upper and lower parts in\nfigure 6(c) correspond to the HC related to the left and right reservoirs, respectively.\nThe blue, black, and red solid lines represent the DHC, the CHC, and the THC. The\nTHC describes that the heat flows from the high-temperature to the low-temperature\nreservoirs, so the DHC or CHC with the opposite sign to the THC means that the IHC\nis generated. It is evident in figure 6(c) that the IHCs are present related to both the\nleft and right heat reservoirs.\nIt is counter-intuitive that HC spontaneously flows from the hot to the cold. This is\na beautiful phenomenon due to the fantastic features of quantum mechanics. It can be\nunderstood as follows. The IHC is only a THC sub-HC, which perfectly obeys intuition.\nThe macroscopic HC is further the statistical average of the THCs, so it is impossible\nto realize the spontaneous IHC macroscopically."

The CHR has been shown to have the advantage\nof enhancing the steady-state entanglement of the system [58], improving the efficiency\nof refrigerators [77] and the amplification of transistors [48], etc. Based on two two-\nlevel atoms with CHRs, it is reported that quantum switch can be realized via two\ncoupled superconducting qubits connecting RC oscillators [34], and quantum diode with\nhigh rectification can be achieved by the same system connecting RLC oscillators [78].\nComparably, we have designed a modulator utilizing the property of the dark state.\nIn fact, the dark state is not a new concept, especially considering wide\napplications in quantum information and quantum optics, such as electromagnetic\ninduced transparency (EIT) [79], quantum nonreciprocity [80] and so on. \u2018Dark state\u2019\ndoes not evolve with time and is immune to decoherence and dissipation. It is attracting\nincreasing interest in the potential applications in quantum thermal machines. For\nexample, in reference [81], we use the dark state to block the heat current in a\nquantum refrigerator; In reference [77], the dark state can double the performance of\nthe refrigerator without any external resources; In reference [48], we use the dark state\nto design quantum switch and in reference [82], the heat diode is designed by using the\nproperty of blocking heat transfer.\nIn conclusion, we have studied the HCs of two coupled TLAs in CHRs using\nthe BMS master equation and their analytic expressions. When the dissipation rates\nbetween the atoms and the heat reservoirs are not the same, we compared HCs in the\ncases of CHRs and IHRs of the same model. When considering the influence of CHR\nwith g and \u03c9m, we find that CHRs have a slight influence on HCs, indicating that the result of crossing dissipation on HCs is close to zero, but the CHR effect is negative\nbecause of the potentially present inverse heat currents. When we consider its variation\nwith \u03b3i, it is found that CHR does not always inhibit HC but also could enhance it, which depends on the practical scenario such as \u03b3i, \u03c9m, and TL. A significant result is that when the dissipation rates corresponding to the same eigenfrequency are equal, i.e., \u03b3mn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) = \u03b3i, the steady-state of the system is not unique and is a linear mixture of two states which include a \u2019dark state\u2019 contributing zero HC. So our TLAs model can\nact as a thermal modulator, in which we can continuously control the population \u03c122 by a single-mode laser and then continuously control HC. We also find that the variation\ntendencies of steady-state COA and the HC with temperature are consistent.\nThis simple model shed new insight into relevant research in two aspects: CHR\ncan create inverse heat currents which have no classical counterpart for macroscopic\nsystems, and the steady-state thermal modulator can be effectively controlled by the\ninitial states, which, via a dark state, determines the fractions of each component in\nsteady state as well as the HCs."

(B.2)\nSince the atomic system is unchanged, the diagonal HS, the eigenoperators, and\ncorresponding eigenfrequencies are consistent with the case of CHRs. In the interaction\npicture, the interaction Hamiltonian is\nH\u0303 \u2032SE(t) = A(t)\u03a51(t) +B \u2032(t)\u03a52(t), (B.3)\nwhere B\u2032(t) = \u2211 j\u2032 fL2j\u2032(a \u2032\u2020 j\u2032e i\u03c9L\u2032j\u2032 t + a\u2032j\u2032e \u2212i\u03c9L\u2032j\u2032 t) + \u2211 k\u2032 fR2k\u2032(b \u2032\u2020 k\u2032e i\u03c9R\u2032k\u2032 t + b\u2032k\u2032e \u2212i\u03c9R\u2032k\u2032 t). (B.4)\nB\u2032(t) = B\u2032\u2020(t) holds and A(t), \u03a51(t) and \u03a52(t) are the same as equations (A.1,A.3,A.4). So the interaction Hamiltonian is\nH\u0303 \u2032SE(t) = \u2211 i=\u00b1 [A(t)V \u20201 (\u03c9i) +B \u2032(t)V \u20202 (\u03c9i)]e i\u03c9it +H.c.. (B.5)\nFollowing the steps in appendix A, since the average values of the generation and annihilation operators of different heat reservoirs are all zero, for example, \u27e8a\u2020a\u2032\u27e9 = 0, equation (A.12) becomes \u222b\u221e 0 d\u03c4\u27e8A(0)B\u2032(\u2212\u03c4)e\u2212i\u03c9\u2212\u03c4 = 0. Hence only the direct coupling dissipative term exists. We can obtain the master equation in the interaction picture\nthe same as equation (14), i.e.,\nL\u03b1(\u03c1) = L11\u03b1 (\u03c1) + L22\u03b1 (\u03c1). (B.6)\nUsing the same method, we can directly calculate HCs without the coupling between\natoms as shown in figure 8(b). The Hamiltonian of the system is\nHS = \u03c91 2 \u03c3z1 + \u03c92 2 \u03c3z2 = 4\u2211 l\u2032=1 \u03bbl\u2032 |l\u2032\u27e9\u27e8l\u2032|, (B.7)\nwhere [\u03bb1\u2032 , \u03bb2\u2032 , \u03bb3\u2032 , \u03bb4\u2032 ] = [\u2212\u03c9s,\u2212\u03c9d, \u03c9d, \u03c9s], and the corresponding eigenstates are |1\u2032\u27e9 = | \u2193\u2193\u27e9, |2\u2032\u27e9 = | \u2193\u2191\u27e9, |3\u2032\u27e9 = | \u2191\u2193\u27e9 and |4\u2032\u27e9 = | \u2191\u2191\u27e9. HE and HSE are the same as equation (3) and equation (4). The eigenoperators are\nV1(\u03c91) = |1\u2032\u27e9\u27e83\u2032|+ |2\u2032\u27e9\u27e84\u2032| = \u03c3\u22121 \u2297 12, (B.8) V2(\u03c92) = |1\u2032\u27e9\u27e82\u2032|+ |3\u2032\u27e9\u27e84\u2032| = 11 \u2297 \u03c3\u22122 , (B.9)\nwhere \u03c3\u2212m = | \u2193\u27e9m\u27e8\u2191 | and the eigenfrequencies are their natural frequencies. Then we can get the master equation as equation (14) with\nL\u03b1(\u03c1) = 2\u2211\nm=1\nJmm\u03b1 (\u2212\u03c9m)(2\u03c3\u2212m\u03c1\u03c3+m \u2212 \u03c3+m\u03c3\u2212m\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1\u03c3+m\u03c3\u2212m)\n+ Jmm\u03b1 (\u03c9m)(2\u03c3 + m\u03c1\u03c3 \u2212 m \u2212 \u03c3\u2212m\u03c3+m\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1\u03c3\u2212m\u03c3+m),\n(B.10)\nwhere Jmm\u03b1 (\u00b1\u03c9m) has the same definition as before. When the two TLAs are in resonance, the crossing-coupling term occurs and the\ndissipation becomes\nL\u03b1(\u03c1) = 2\u2211\nm,n=1\nJmn\u03b1 (\u2212\u03c9)(2\u03c3\u2212n \u03c1\u03c3+m \u2212 \u03c3+m\u03c3\u2212n \u03c1\u2212 \u03c1\u03c3+m\u03c3\u2212n )\n+ Jmn\u03b1 (\u03c9)(2\u03c3 + n \u03c1\u03c3 \u2212 m \u2212 \u03c3\u2212m\u03c3+n \u03c1\u2212 \u03c1\u03c3\u2212m\u03c3+n ). (B.11)\nAs mentioned in section 2, when atoms are connected to common baths, dissipations\ncorresponding to the same eigenfrequency Lmm\u03b1 (\u03c9i) and Lnn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) must lead to cross term Lmn\u03b1 (\u03c9i) no matter whether there is coupling between atoms. The above equation amply illustrates this point. Note that the existence of the cross dissipation without\ninteratomic coupling doesn\u2019t contradict with the Born-Markov approximation which\nemphasizes that the state of the environment is not affected by the interaction between\natoms and reservoirs. No matter how the system interacts with the reservoirs, the states\nof the reservoirs aren\u2019t changed, but their effect on the system of interest should depend\non the concrete interaction between them. In the current case, the CHRs are just shown\nby the cross dissipation.\nWe can also calculate the case of uncoupled atoms\u2019 contact with IHRs. Since each\natom is connected to two reservoirs separately and no other connection between the\natoms as shown in figure 8(c), we only consider the top half for convenience, that is,\none atom is connected to two heat reservoirs, so the total Hamiltonian is\nH = \u03c9\n2 \u03c3z + \u2211 j \u03c9Lja \u2020 jaj + \u2211 k \u03c9Rkb \u2020 kbk + [ \u2211 j fLj (a \u2020 j + aj) + \u2211 k fRk (b \u2020 k + bk)]\u03c3 x. (B.12)\nThere is only one eigenoperator V (\u03c9) = \u03c3\u2212 and the corresponding eigenfrequency is\n\u03c9. In this case, the master equation also can be written as equation (14), but the\ndissipation is\nL\u03b1(\u03c1) =J\u03b1(\u2212\u03c9)(2\u03c3\u2212\u03c1\u03c3+ \u2212 \u03c3+\u03c3\u2212\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1\u03c3+\u03c3\u2212) + J\u03b1(\u03c9)(2\u03c3\n+\u03c1\u03c3\u2212 \u2212 \u03c3\u2212\u03c3+\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1\u03c3\u2212\u03c3+). (B.13)\nThe dissipation of the lower part is the same as the above formula, except that the\neigenfrequency is its natural frequency."

Thus we can obtain the state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 at any time by solving the Schro\u0308dinger equation\nd\ndt |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = \u2212iH|\u03c8(t)\u27e9, (D.3)\nwhere |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (\nc(t) b(t)\n) . One can get the differential equations\nc\u0307(t) = \u2212iw3c(t)\u2212 i\u2126R cos(\u03bd23t)b(t), (D.4) b\u0307(t) = \u2212iw2b(t)\u2212 i\u2126R cos(\u03bd23t)c(t). (D.5)\nDefine\nC(t) = c(t)eiw3t, (D.6)\nB(t) = b(t)eiw2t, (D.7)\nwe can obtain\nC\u0307(t) = \u2212i\u2126R 2 B(t)ei\u2206t, (D.8) B\u0307(t) = \u2212i\u2126R 2 C(t)e\u2212i\u2206t, (D.9)\nwhere \u2206 = w32 \u2212 \u03bd23, w32 = w3 \u2212 w2. For convenience, we make the system resonate with this single-mode laser as \u2206 = 0. Take the derivative of equation (D.8) with respect\nto time, we get\nC\u0308(t) + \u21262R 4 C(t) = 0. (D.10)\nIf we set the initial state to be |\u03c8(0)\u27e9 = (\nC(0) B(0)\n) , the solution |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 =\n( [cos(\u2126Rt\n2 )C(0)\u2212 i sin(\u2126Rt 2 )B(0)]eiw3t\n[cos(\u2126Rt 2 )B(0)\u2212 i sin(\u2126Rt 2 )C(0)]eiw2t\n) . (D.11)\nThe populations can be given as\n\u03c133(t) = A\u2212\n2 cos(\u2126Rt) +\nA+\n2 , (D.12)\n\u03c122(t) = \u2212 A\u2212\n2 cos(\u2126Rt) +\nA+\n2 , (D.13)\nwhere A\u00b1 = |C(0)|2 \u00b1 |B(0)|2."
