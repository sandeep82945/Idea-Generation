    "abstractText": "Four new alkylamides named retroframides A-D (1-4) together with twenty-two known compounds were isolated from the fruits of Piper rectrofractum. The structures of new compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data including 2D NMR and chemical derivatization followed by GC-MS analysis. Of isolated compounds, piperine (25) and pellitorine (26) revealed moderate inhibition against tyrosinase with percentage inhibition of 36.1 and 40.7. List of supplementary material Figure S1.
