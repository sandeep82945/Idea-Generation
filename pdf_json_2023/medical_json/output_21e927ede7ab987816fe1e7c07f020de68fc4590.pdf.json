It is a specifc level of prehospital medical care provided by the trained responders, including emergency medical technicians, in the absence of advanced medical care to minimize the patient\u2019s critical condition. BLS course trains participants to promptly recognize several life-threatening emergencies, give highquality chest compressions, deliver appropriate ventilations, and provide early use of an automated external defbrillator (AED) [2]. Basic Life Support (BLS) is a lifesaving intervention in a premedical facility. Adequate knowledge and awareness about BLS and Cardiac pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are mandatory for the healthcare worker working in\na hospital [3, 4]. Cardiac arrest or cardiopulmonary arrest can leave the victims with severe morbidities or lead to death if not attended to instantly or treated promptly. Early identifcation and intervention of cardiac arrest victims by performing CPR are the cornerstones of BLS, which helps sustain the patient\u2019s life until defnitive medical care arrives and the patient is transferred to a hospital setting for further advanced management. BLS\u2019s purpose is to maintain the airway, breathing, and circulation through CPR. CPR is an emergency procedure for the restoration of cardiac and respiratory functions after cardiac arrest [5, 6]. It consists of a combination of mouth-to-mouth ventilation and external chest compression that is given to a person thought to have been in cardiac arrest [7]. It is performed by anyone who knows how to do it anywhere and immediately, without equipment and protective devices. It may include\nHindawi Journal of Healthcare Engineering Volume 2023, Article ID 9936114, 6 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/9936114\nconsiderations of patient transport such as the protection of the cervical spine and avoiding additional injuries through splinting and immobilization [8]. It includes psychomotor skills for performing high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), using an automated external defbrillator (AED), and relieving an obstructed airway for patients of all ages. American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines suggest that every missed minute in applying defbrillation in a cardiac arrest decreases the survival rate by 7%\u201310% [9]. According to European Resuscitation Council (ERC), early resuscitation and prompt defbrillation (within 1-2minutes) can result in >60% survival [10]."

Te study used a technique called purposive sampling. Knowledge of basic life support was the study's dependent variable, and social-demographic factors such as age, gender, religion, place of residence, and educational attainment of healthcare workers with valid work permits were the study's independent variables. Both genders were included in the study, whereas medical ofcers, consultants, and hospital incharge were excluded from the study.\nTe self-structured closed-ended questionnaire was used to collect data which contains two parts; part I consists of socio-demographic data such as age, gender, work experience, previous training, and education level, and part II consists of items related to knowledge regarding basic life support. A scoring key was designed where each correct answer was awarded 1 mark and the wrong answer 0. Tus, the item maximum score was 30 and the minimum was 0. Consequently, the highest total knowledge score for health workers was 30. Since health workers should have sufcient knowledge in this very critical area, knowledge scores of above 23 or >75% were considered \u201cadequate\u201d knowledge, scores 15\u201323 or 50\u201375% were considered \u201cmoderate\u201d knowledge, and scores of below 15 or <50% were considered as \u201cinadequate\u201d knowledge.\nBefore actual data collection, the instrument was pretested on 10% of the total sample size. Ethical consideration was taken from Purbanchal University and informed consent was designed; confdentiality of the information was maintained throughout the study. Collected data were checked and rechecked for their completeness for missing items before their processing, and that data were edited, coded, and entered into computer base software using SPSSV20 by using both descriptive and inferential statistics [14, 15]."

P value by the chi-square test was found to be 0.021637 \u2217P value <0.05 considered to be statically significant (Table 3), but it is found that there is no association between gender and level of knowledge. Te P value by the chi-square test was found to be 0.990895. P value >0.05 considered to be statically nonsignifcant. Our study revealed that there is no association between the qualifcation of respondents and their level of knowledge; the P value by the chi-square test was found to be 0.9885 and is nonsignifcant. Table 3 depicts that there is no association between the work experience of respondents and their level of knowledge as the P value by the chi-square test is 0.840103 and it shows that it is nonsignifcant. Te present study demonstrates that there is a strong relationship between the previous training of respondents and their level of knowledge as the P value is 0.026244 which is highly signifcant."

            "text": "According to studies and reports, RTA (Road Trafc Accidents), cut injuries, and sudden cardiac deaths are the major life-threatening risks in Nepal. Te risk of road trafc death is 3 times higher in low-income countries (8.3 deaths per 100,000 populations) when compared to high-income countries [16]. In all of the major trauma and cardiac arrest or emergency cases, BLS support is necessary to save a life in a prehospital facility. Te BLS program is designed to deliver knowledge to a wide range of healthcare professionals about several life-threatening emergencies. It also demonstrates training to provide CPR, use an AED, and relieve choking in a safe, timely, and efective manner to treat those emergencies. It is mandatory for all healthcare professionals to have comprehensive knowledge and skill about BLS [17, 18]. Hence, all healthcare institutes should emphasize training the healthcare professionals working in hospitals for the BLS.\nOur study included 95 respondents; the majority of respondents were of the 30\u201340 age group followed by the 20\u201330 age group and at least the 40\u201350 age groups.Temean age of the study participants was found to be 33 years. Tese fndings are comparable to a previously published similar study, which reported that most of their respondents were between 23 and 40 years old. In our study, the comparison of knowledge among the various age groups revealed statistical signifcance [19].\nIn our study, the majority of respondents were females (89.47%) (Table 1). Tis fnding was in accordance with the results reported by another researcher from Botswana [20]. In their study on cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowledge and skills of registered nurses, they detected that most of the studied group were females. Another study conducted in India (focused on knowledge and perspective on CPR among staf nurses) declared that most of their study group was female [21]. Te current work revealed no signifcant diferences in BLS knowledge level and gender (Table 3); this was in accordance with a study from Botswana [20].\nIn the current study, more than half of the respondents, that is, 56 (58.95%), were profcient in the certifcate level in\nnursing (PCL Nursing) followed by auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), that is, 21 (22.11%), and then health assistant (HA) and community medicine assistant (CMA), that is, 9 (9.47%). Moreover, our study concluded that there was no association between the BLS knowledge level and academic qualifcation. It is to be noted that our results were supported by an investigation conducted by researchers from Nepal. In their study on knowledge regarding basic life support among nurses of a tertiary-level hospital, there was no association between nurses\u2019 knowledge and their academic qualifcation [22].\nBased on work experience, our study demonstrates that the maximum year of experience is of 2-3 years 40 (42.11%), followed by 3-4 years\u2019 experience was 25 (26.32%), <1 year was about 17 (17.89%), and 1-2 years\u2019 experience was 13 (13.68%). Tere are no signifcant diferences in the BLS knowledge level and years of experience. Te majority of participants have not received any training regarding BLS. Only 15 (15.79%) of respondents have received training and 80 (84.21%) have not received any training. In the current study, we found a signifcant association between the knowledge level and previous training (Table 3).

BSL training and clinical exposure infuence the retention of knowledge; there is a need for all healthcare professionals to have some standard training and assessment. Te research study was conducted to assess the knowledge regarding Basic Life Support and healthcare workers in hospitals. On the basis of the fndings of the study, some recommendations such as a comparative study can be conducted, and a similar study can be conducted to fnd out the efectiveness of awareness and knowledge-sharing programs regarding Basic Life Support."
