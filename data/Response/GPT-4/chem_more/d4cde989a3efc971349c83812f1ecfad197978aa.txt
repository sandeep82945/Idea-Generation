Investigation of Sorption Dynamics: A detailed study on the sorption and desorption processes of cannabis biomarkers, especially THC, THC–OH, and THC–COOH, between suspended solids and the aqueous phase in influent wastewater. This research could elucidate the mechanisms affecting the distribution of these compounds and improve the accuracy of cannabis consumption estimates from wastewater analysis.

Development of Advanced Analytical Techniques: Exploration and development of more sophisticated and sensitive analytical methods or improvements to existing techniques such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) to enhance the detection and quantification of THC biomarkers in both liquid and solid phases of wastewater. These methods could focus on increasing throughput, reducing sample preparation time, or enhancing selectivity and sensitivity.

Clinical Studies on Excretion Rates: Conducting clinical studies to accurately determine the urinary and fecal excretion rates of THC and its metabolites. Such studies are crucial for improving the back-calculation models used in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to estimate cannabis consumption accurately. These should consider variations due to factors like sex, race, and consumption methods.

Impact of Wastewater Treatment Processes on THC Biomarkers: Researching how different wastewater treatment processes affect the concentration and detectability of THC biomarkers. Understanding these effects is critical for assessing the efficiency of drug removal during treatment and for the accurate interpretation of WBE data, especially concerning the fate of biomarkers in the environment.

Temporal and Spatial Variations in Cannabis Consumption: A comprehensive study on the temporal (short-term and long-term trends) and spatial (across different regions or cities) variations in cannabis consumption by analyzing both the liquid and solid phases of influent wastewater. This could include the development of a correction factor for more accurate estimations of total biomarker concentration in raw influent wastewater, taking into account the contributions from suspended solids.
