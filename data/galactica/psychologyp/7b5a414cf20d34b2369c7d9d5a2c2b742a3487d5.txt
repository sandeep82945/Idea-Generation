Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting radiopharmaceuticals have been successfully used for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer. Optimization of the available agents is desirable to improve tumor uptake and reduce side effects to non-target organs. This can be achieved, for instance, via linker modifications or multimerization approaches. In this study, we evaluated a small library of PSMA-targeting derivatives with modified linker residues, and selected the best candidate based on its binding affinity to PSMA. The lead compound was coupled to a chelator for radiolabeling, and subject to dimerization. The resulting molecules, 22 and 30, were highly PSMA specific (IC50 = 1.0–1.6 nM) and stable when radiolabeled with indium-111 (>90% stable in PBS and mouse serum up to 24 h). Moreover, [111In]In-30 presented a high uptake in PSMA expressing LS174T cells, with 92.6% internalization compared to 34.1% for PSMA-617. Biodistribution studies in LS174T mice xenograft models showed that [111In]In-30 had a higher tumor and kidney uptake compared to [111In]In-PSMA-617, but increasing T/K and T/M ratios at 24 h p.i. Tumors could be clearly visualized at 1 h p.i. by SPECT/CT after administration of [111In]In-22 and [111In]In-PSMA-617, while [111In]In-30 showed a clear signal at later time-points (e.g., 24 h p.i.). 1. conclusions Linker modifications consisting of 1–3 amino acids to a PSMA-targeting EuK(Ahx) vector were well tolerated, with the compounds retaining binding to PSMA in the nanomolar range. The EuK(Ahx–Sta–Phe–Asp) (16) sequence provided the best binding affinity to PSMA among the library of compounds, which is attributed to its hydrophobicity, the presence of an aromatic group, and a negative charge on the linker. Attachment of a DOTA-GA chelator for radiochemical evaluation using indium-111 yielded [111In]In-22, which showed good tumor targeting properties with low off-target retention in LS174T PSMA-positive tumor xenograft models. The homobivalent [111In]In-30 was designed based on this sequence, and it demonstrated high uptake and internalization in LS174T cells. [111In]In-30 showed increasing T/M and T/K ratios over time and good tumor targeting properties
