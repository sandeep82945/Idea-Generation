    "abstractText": "Orbital conjunctival epithelial cysts have traditionally been excised, with the risk of leaving behind remnants that may result in recurrences. We present an 18-year-old male who complained of a poorly retained prosthesis three years after a primary evisceration and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) ball implant. We performed cyst aspiration and injection foam sclerotherapy for the cyst, which resolved completely in six weeks, allowing the prosthesis to be retained comfortably. Aspiration and injection of sclerosing agents may result in the collapse of the cyst along with fibrosis of their walls with obliteration of the lumen, resulting in complete resolution.

            "text": "Conjunctival epithelial inclusion cysts of the orbit following evisceration are uncommon; however, there have been several modalities of treatment used to manage them. In an anophthalmic socket, these cysts can result in an ill-fitting ocular prosthesis due to the rise in surface area or migration of the orbital implant. The patient might suffer from the inability to retain the prosthesis, and this is usually when the patient presents, resulting in poor cosmesis [1]. These cysts can be dealt with using several methods, such as complete excision and marsupialization, sometimes aided by the use of fibrin glue injection. They can be injected with sclerosing agents such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS), absolute alcohol, trichloroacetic acid, and bleomycin [2]. As it may be difficult to entirely excise these cysts without leaving any residual remnants that can cause recurrence, it would be wise to master the injection of sclerosing agents to achieve a good result. Here, we report an orbital inclusion cyst in an anophthalmic socket following evisceration with primary polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) ball implantation treated by foam sclerotherapy. An extensive literature review reveals that foam sclerotherapy has never been reported in an orbital conjunctival cyst in an eviscerated socket."

            "text": "An 18-year-old Indian male presented to us with complaints of displacement of his custom ocular prosthesis (Figure 1a) and occasionally the inability to retain the prosthesis within the socket. He had undergone an evisceration along with primary placement of a PMMA implant of the left eye four years prior due to an anterior staphyloma. He described a gradual displacement of his prosthesis over the past nine months. On examination, it was found that he had a conjunctival cyst within the orbit (Figure 1b), which had resulted in the orbital implant being pushed superotemporally, thus explaining the resultant prosthesis displacement. One week post the injection, there was a reduction in the proptosis caused by the cyst, and the patient was able to retain the prosthesis (Figure 1c, 1d). Six weeks after the procedure, the cyst had resolved completely, and the prosthesis was well placed (Figure 1e, 1f).\nHow to cite this article Thomas R, Grover A (July 08, 2023) Foam Sclerotherapy for Conjunctival Inclusion Cyst Post Evisceration.

In the supine position, with topical anesthetic instilled, the area was painted and draped, and a speculum was placed on the side of the anophthalmic socket (Figure 3a). With the help of a 23 gauge needle and 10 ml syringe, the needle was inserted into the highest point of the cyst and aspirated (Figure 3b). Once all the fluid was removed, the syringe was replaced (Figure 3c) with a syringe containing foamed STS solution (30mg/ml) and injected into the hollow cyst (Figure 3d).\n2023 Thomas et al.

The patient preferred the option of prosthesis modification for the management of his left upper lid ptosis."

            "text": "Foam sclerotherapy is an inexpensive and easily performed procedure that has been used for periorbital dermoid cysts [3] and veno-lymphatic malformations of the eyelid and anterior orbit [4] with good results. Conjunctival cysts that occur primarily after evisceration and implant are rare, and they usually occur due to a secondary cause such as implantation of the conjunctiva deeper or in case of complex surgery. Complete excision is complicated by thin walls of the cyst that may rupture easily [2]. Thus, it is important that one is able to perform sclerotherapy which, in most cases, works well in the long term. The advantage of this quick and simple procedure is that it can be repeated if needed in case of recurrence or incomplete resolution. If the cyst recurs multiple times, surgical excision with careful dissection and removal of the capsule may be warranted. STS works predictably due to its surfactant nature by cyst wall fibrosis and collapse of the cyst lumen. Patients can be followed up with repeat CT scans of the orbit as necessary."
