    "abstractText": "17 Abstract: Chronic exposure of the lung to irritants such as allergen is a primary cause of asthma 18 characterized by exaggerated airway constriction, also called hyperreactivity, which can be life19 threatening. Aside from immune cells, vagal sensory neurons are important for airway 20 hyperreactivity 1-4. However, the identity and signature of the downstream nodes of this adaptive 21 circuit remains poorly understood. Here we show that a single population of Dbh+ neurons in the 22 nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) of the brainstem, and downstream neurons in the nucleus 23 ambiguous (NA), are both necessary and sufficient for chronic allergen-induced airway 24 hyperreactivity. We found that repeated exposures of mice to inhaled allergen activates nTS 25 neurons in a mast cell-, interleukin 4 (IL-4)and vagal nerve-dependent manner. Single-nucleus 26 RNA-seq of the nTS at baseline and following allergen challenges reveals that a Dbh+ population 27 is preferentially activated. Ablation or chemogenetic inactivation of Dbh+ nTS neurons blunted, 28 while chemogenetic activation promoted hyperreactivity. Viral tracing indicates that Dbh+ nTS 29 neurons, capable of producing norepinephrine, project to the NA, and NA neurons are necessary 30 and sufficient to relay allergen signals to postganglionic neurons that then directly drive airway 31 constriction. Focusing on transmitters, delivery of norepinephrine antagonists to the NA blunted 32 allergen-induced hyperreactivity. Together, these findings provide molecular, anatomical and 33 functional definitions of key nodes of a canonical allergen response circuit. The knowledge 34 opens the possibility of targeted neural modulation as an approach to control refractory allergen35 induced airway constriction. 36",

Aside from immune cells, vagal sensory neurons are important for airway 20 hyperreactivity 1-4. However, the identity and signature of the downstream nodes of this adaptive 21 circuit remains poorly understood. Here we show that a single population of Dbh+ neurons in the 22 nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) of the brainstem, and downstream neurons in the nucleus 23 ambiguous (NA), are both necessary and sufficient for chronic allergen-induced airway 24 hyperreactivity. We found that repeated exposures of mice to inhaled allergen activates nTS 25 neurons in a mast cell-, interleukin 4 (IL-4)- and vagal nerve-dependent manner. Single-nucleus 26 RNA-seq of the nTS at baseline and following allergen challenges reveals that a Dbh+ population 27 is preferentially activated. Ablation or chemogenetic inactivation of Dbh+ nTS neurons blunted, 28 while chemogenetic activation promoted hyperreactivity. Viral tracing indicates that Dbh+ nTS 29 neurons, capable of producing norepinephrine, project to the NA, and NA neurons are necessary 30 and sufficient to relay allergen signals to postganglionic neurons that then directly drive airway 31 constriction. Focusing on transmitters, delivery of norepinephrine antagonists to the NA blunted 32 allergen-induced hyperreactivity. Together, these findings provide molecular, anatomical and 33 functional definitions of key nodes of a canonical allergen response circuit. The knowledge 34 opens the possibility of targeted neural modulation as an approach to control refractory allergen-35 induced airway constriction. 36\n37 38 39\nInteroception, a concept first introduced over 100 years ago 5, defines a fundamental 40 biological process whereby the nervous system senses and responds to the inner state of the body 41 including that of internal organs 6. Recent work has begun to unravel the neural mechanisms for 42 interoception in many tissues, including the larynx, heart, intestine, and bladder 7-11. However, 43 knowledge remains limited on complete multi-synaptic circuits that sense signals from organs, 44 integrate them in the nervous system, and respond to them through modulation of organ function. 45 The lung, given its large surface area, rich nerve innervation and direct exposure to aerosol 46 environment, is a prominent source of interoceptive signals 12-15. In lung, airway constriction, 47 triggered by exposure to irritants including allergen, is a normal protective physiologic response. 48 It is driven by contraction of smooth muscles that wrap around the airways 16. Following chronic 49 exposure, allergen would trigger exacerbated airway constriction, also termed airway 50 hyperreactivity. The resulting restricted airflow is a primary asthma morbidity and a major cause 51 of asthma-associated deaths. 52 It has been shown that in repeated allergen-challenged mice but not in na\u00efve mice, vagotomy 53 abolished airway hyperreactivity as assayed in the presence of methacholine, a synthetic 54 acetylcholine analogue, suggesting dependence of the hyperreactivity on vagal reflex 2. 55 Similarly, ablation or repression of Trpv1+ or Nav1.8+ vagal afferent neurons led to reduced 56 airway hyperreactivity in allergen-challenged mice, but not methacholine-induced acute 57 constriction in na\u00efve mice 3,4. In the context of repeated allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity, 58 the identity of the nodes downstream of vagal afferent neurons, their molecular signatures, and 59 the nature of neurotransmitters and signals remain poorly defined. 60 A key knowledge gap is the brainstem neurons important for transmitting the chronic 61 allergen signal. Mapping data from us and others show that lung-innervating vagal sensory 62 neurons project exclusively to the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) region of the brainstem 63 8,13,15,17. Aside from lung, nTS integrates sensory inputs from many organs including the heart, 64 gut and intestine 8,9,14,18,19. As a key signal relay center, neurons in the nTS project to higher 65 order brain nuclei, as well as effector areas in the brainstem, including the dorsal motor nucleus 66 of the vagus nerve (DMV) and nucleus ambiguous (NA) 20-22. Systematic analyses of the 67 neuronal diversity of the nTS and their downstream nodes are critical for interrogating functional 68 heterogeneity and specificity. 69 In this study, we dissect the mechanism of how normal lungs react to repeated allergen 70 exposures, a disease-relevant adaptive response that is distinct from acute airway constriction. In 71 wild-type mice, we show that repeated, but not single, allergen challenges led to localized 72 activation of nTS neurons. This activation is reduced in either mast cell mutants, after treatment 73 with interleukin 4 (IL-4) neutralizing antibody, or upon vagotomy. Genetic ablation of activated 74 nTS neurons blunted allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity, but not goblet cell metaplasia or 75 type 2 immune cell recruitment. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), we 76 identified 13 distinct neuron types in the nTS. Using this dataset, we identified a single Dbh+ 77 sub-population that is enriched for allergen-activated neurons. Ablating or disrupting the 78 function of Dbh+ nTS neurons blunted airway hyperreactivity, while activating them in place of 79 allergen exposure promoted hyperreactivity in sensitized airways. On the descending efferent 80 side, Dbh+ nTS neurons project to parasympathetic neurons in the NA region of the brainstem. 81 Chemogenetic inactivation of Chat+ neurons in the NA, but not the DMV, attenuated airway 82 hyperreactivity, while activation of NA neurons in place of allergen exposure promoted 83 hyperreactivity in sensitized airways. Blocking norepinephrine receptors in the NA blunted 84 allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity. Instead of projecting directly to lung, NA neurons 85 project to postganglionic neurons in the trachea and extrapulmonary bronchi, which in turn target 86 airway smooth muscles. Taken together, these in vivo data delineate a complete interoception 87\nneural circuit in the normal lung that is conditioned by repeated allergen exposures, and is 88 composed of nodes in the brainstem that are both necessary and sufficient for allergen-induced 89 airway hyperreactivity, mimicking exacerbated airway constriction in asthma. 90 91 nTS neurons were activated upon repeated, but not single, inhaled allergen challenges 92\nTo investigate neurons involved in allergen response, we used a mouse model of asthma with 93 chronic intranasal instillation of house dust mites (HDM), a known trigger for asthmatic 94 responses in human and rodents 23. We employed a well-established regimen, with multiple 95 doses of allergen administrations to lung (Fig. 1a) 24,25. This triggered the expected asthmatic 96 responses including exacerbated airway smooth muscle constriction, also termed hyperreactivity, 97 goblet cell metaplasia and type 2 immune cell infiltration (Fig. 1q, r, Extended Data Fig. 1a, 6d-98 f). Extending beyond previous findings indicating that allergen acts through vagal neurons 3,4,26, 99 we addressed if allergen administered to lung could trigger brainstem neuron activation. 100 Immunostaining for immediate early factor FOS, a neuronal activation marker, two hours after 101 each of the challenges in serial sections of the whole brainstem revealed an increase of FOS+ 102 cells in HDM-treated mice compared to saline-treated control mice (Fig. 1b, c, Extended Data 103 Fig. 1b-v). Increased FOS+ cells were enriched in the dorsomedial part of the nTS region 104 between Bregma -7.20 mm and Bregma -8.08 mm (Extended Data Fig. 1b-u) in comparison to 105 other regions such as the adjoining area postrema (AP), DMV and hypoglossal nucleus (12N) 106 (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b). This enrichment in the nTS is consistent with the findings that lung 107 innervating sensory nerves project specifically to the same dorsomedial part of the nTS at these 108 Bregma regions 8,13,15,17. The increase is found to be statistically significant only after the 4th 109 HDM challenge, but not after the previous three doses (Extended Data Fig. 3a-i), further 110 corroborated by Fos transcript signal (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). These findings suggest that 111 there is conditioning of nTS neurons by repeated, but not single-dose administration of allergen. 112 It is reported that mast cells are required for the development of allergen-induced airway 113 constriction 27-29. Using the same mast cell deficient c-Kitw-sh/w-sh mice, we found a statistically 114 significant decrease of FOS+ neurons in the nTS following HDM challenge compared to 115 heterozygous c-Kitw-sh/+ controls (Fig. 1d, e). These data suggest that signals relayed through 116 mast cells are an important contributor to allergen-induced nTS activation. 117 Mast cells are among immune cells that produce type 2 immune signals, including interleukin 118 4 (IL-4), which are critical for allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity 30,31. It is reported that 119 neutralization of IL-4 using antibodies can abrogate allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity 30. 120 Using the same IL-4 neutralizing antibody and regimen, we found that administration of anti-IL-121 4, but not isotype control antibody significantly decreased the number of FOS+ neurons in the 122 nTS (Fig. 1f-h). 123 To determine if vagal nerves are essential for allergen activation of nTS, we performed 124 unilateral vagotomy before allergen administration. This led to a statistically significant decrease 125 of FOS+ neurons on the ipsilateral operated side compared to the contralateral side following 126 HDM challenge (Fig. 1i, j), suggesting that vagal nerves are required for transmitting allergen 127 signals to the nTS. 128 To further quantify cumulative allergen-induced activation and also test a tool to manipulate 129 these neurons, we crossed Fos2A-iCreER (TRAP2) mice to Rosa-lxl-tdTomato (Ai14) mice to label 130 activated neurons with tdTomato. Following 4-OH tamoxifen injection after each of the HDM 131 challenge or saline administration (2nd, 3rd and 4th doses, Fig. 1k), we cleared the whole brain and 132 brainstem using CLARITY 32. We found a statistically significant increase of activated 133 tdTomato+ neurons in the nTS of HDM-treated mice compared to saline-treated controls (Fig. 1l, 134\nm). This was further confirmed through serial sectioning and quantification (Extended Data Fig. 135 5a-c). These findings paved the way for manipulating these allergen-activated nTS neurons. 136\n137 Ablation of allergen-activated nTS neurons blunted airway hyperreactivity 138 To determine if activation of nTS neurons plays a role in allergen-induced responses, we 139 crossed Fos2A-iCreER; Rosa-lxl-tdTomato (TRAP2; Ai14) mice to Rosa-lxl-DTR mice to express 140 diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) in allergen-activated neurons (TRAP2; Ai14; DTR, Fig. 1n). 141 Following bilateral injection of diphtheria toxin (DTX) into nTS, we confirmed a decrease of 142 allergen-activated neurons in the nTS (Fig. 1o, p). 143 To determine if targeted nTS neuron ablation affects airway hyperreactivity, we utilized a 144 well-established assay that is tailored to test this exacerbated adaptive physiological response as 145 a result of repeated allergen challenges 1,33. Following the last dose of HDM or saline 146 administration, increasing doses of methacholine, a synthetic analogue of acetylcholine, was 147 intratracheally administered into the airway to mimic what occurs in asthma patients, namely 148 how acute triggers elicit chronically heightened airway exacerbation, the so-called \u201casthma 149 attack\u201d. Aside from directly acting on airway smooth muscles to trigger contraction, 150 methacholine also signals to vagal afferent fibers to activate them which enhance smooth muscle 151 constriction 2-4,34. In rodents, lung mechanics including airway hyperreactivity are commonly 152 assayed using the flexiVent system. 153 Using this assay, in wild-type mice, as expected, we found that multiple doses of HDM 154 sensitization and challenge led to further increase of flexiVent measurement of respiratory 155 system resistance (Rrs) and elastance (Ers) compared to the saline control group, demonstrating 156 allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity (Fig. 1q, r, N=5 for Saline, N=6 for HDM). As this 157 hyperreactivity is abrogated by vagotomy 2, the differential airway constriction between the 158 HDM and saline groups is primarily due to methacholine-activated vagal reflex rather than its 159 direct effect on airway smooth muscles. Thus, by comparing the extent of airway constriction 160 triggered by the same concentration of methacholine, we used the differences between 161 experimental groups and corresponding controls as a measure of the impact of the chronically 162 adaptive vagal circuit. 163 In the DTR-DTX experimental group, DTX ablation of allergen-activated nTS neurons led to 164 blunted airway hyperreactivity compared to vehicle-injected group (Fig. 1s, t, N=4 for vehicle 165 injection control, N=7 for DTX injection), suggesting that allergen-activated nTS neurons are 166 part of the circuit conditioned by HDM to control airway hyperreactivity. In contrast, there was 167 no change in HDM-induced goblet cell metaplasia, type 2 immune cell recruitment or expression 168 of key type 2 cytokine genes Il4, Il5 and Il13 (Extended Data Fig. 6a-i). These data together 169 suggest that while allergen-activated nTS neurons do not substantially modulate goblet 170 metaplasia or type 2 immune recruitment, they are critical for amplifying allergen-induced 171 airway hyperreactivity. 172\n173 Single nucleus transcriptomic signatures of the nTS allow dissection of diversity and 174 selectivity 175 The nTS is known to receive diverse signals from many organs, including lung, heart, gut, 176 intestine, etc 8,9,14,18,19. To identify which specific subset of the nTS neurons were activated by 177 allergen response in lung, we started with defining the overall molecular diversity of the nTS 178 through single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using flash frozen tissues. This method 179 was chosen over single-cell RNA sequencing to avoid tissue digestion, cell dissociation and 180 sorting which reduces neuronal viability and can also artificially induce cellular stress signatures 181 35. Using anatomical landmarks to minimize incorporation of the adjacent AP and DMV regions, 182\nwe dissected the whole nTS region from adult wild-type mice (Fig. 2a). Transcriptome data from 183 12,966 nTS nuclei were obtained using 10x Genomics technology. Unsupervised clustering 184 analysis revealed 8148 neurons and 4818 glial cells. Focusing on neurons, we further purified 185 nTS neurons in silico by excluding AP and DMV neurons as identified by their profiles from two 186 recently published snRNA-seq datasets of these regions 36,37. The remaining nTS neurons 187 segregated into 13 clusters as shown in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) 188 plots (Fig. 2b), a comparable number to a recent published nTS single cell-RNAseq dataset 38. 189 All 13 neuronal clusters express pan-neuronal markers Rbfox3 and Snap25 (Fig. 2c, d), with little 190 expression of glial marker genes (GFAP, Olig1, Aqp4 or Tmem119, Extended Data Fig. 7a-d). 191 Five neuronal clusters (Clusters 1, 2, 5, 9,12) are Scl17a6+ glutamatergic excitatory neurons, 192 while the remaining eight clusters (Clusters 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11,13) are Slc32a1+ GABAergic 193 inhibitory neurons (Fig. 2e, f). Individual neuronal populations were clearly distinguished by a 194 set of marker genes (Fig. 2g). We further validated the expressions of marker genes using UMAP 195 plots and either our own RNAscope in situ hybridization assay (for excitatory clusters, Fig. 2h-q) 196 or data from the Allen Brain Atlas (for inhibitory clusters, Extended Data Fig. 7e-l). A 197 comprehensive analysis of genes encoding neurotransmitter/neuropeptide receptors, 198 neurotransmitter synthesis/secretion machineries, neuropeptides and hormones revealed the 199 molecular capabilities of each neuronal population in receiving and transmitting signals 200 (Extended Data Fig. 7m-o). 201\n202 Dbh+ neurons in the nTS were preferentially activated upon allergen challenge 203 To determine the molecular signature of allergen-activated nTS neurons, we compared nTS 204 snRNA-seq signatures of wild-type mice 1.5 hours after the 4th saline or 4th HDM challenge. 205 Compared to na\u00efve nTS, the same 13 neuron subtypes were detected in saline- and HDM-206 challenged nTS (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 8a). Among the five clusters (Clusters 1, 6, 7, 10 207 and 12) that show Log2 average expression levels of Fos above 0, Cluster 1 is the only excitatory 208 cluster that showed an increase of the percentage of Fos+ neurons (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 209 8b). Hence, we focused on Cluster 1 to determine its role in allergen-induced responses. 210 To validate that Cluster 1 neurons were activated upon HDM challenge, we performed 211 double in situ hybridization with Fos and Cluster 1 marker gene Dbh (Fig. 3c). By Dbh 212 RNAscope in situ hybridization on serial sections, we found that within nTS, Dbh expression is 213 consistently detected between Bregma -6.96 mm and Bregma -8.08 mm, encompassing the 214 regions where allergen-induced Fos+ cells were enriched (Extended Data Fig. 1b-u, Extended 215 Data Fig. 9a). On individual sections, we observed a substantial overlap between Dbh and Fos, 216 where 59.11% Dbh+ neurons were Fos+, and 38.18% Fos+ neurons were Dbh+ (Fig. 3d, N=12 217 sections). To better assay the spectrum of allergen-activated neurons, we also screened a number 218 of additional known nTS neuronal markers 38-40, including Cnr1, Th and Cck. We found that after 219 HDM challenge, there were some Fos overlap with Cnr1 and Th, but not Cck (Extended Data 220\nFig. 10a-c). Among Fos+ neurons, the Dbh+ neurons appear more enriched compared to Cnr1+ or 221 Th+ neurons. 222 To further confirm that Dbh+ neurons were activated, and to validate a driver line to 223 manipulate these neurons, we crossed transgenic Dbh-cre mice to Rosa-lxl-tdTomato (Ai14) 224\nmice. In Dbh-cre; Ai14 mice, double in situ hybridization of Dbh and tdTomato showed >95% 225 overlap of signals, confirming specificity of cre expression (Extended Data Fig. 11a, b, N=6 226 sections). After HDM administrations in Dbh-cre; Ai14 mice, we observed a substantial overlap 227 between tdTomato+ and FOS+ neurons in the nTS (41.99% tdTomato+ neurons were Fos+, and 228 57.59% Fos+ neurons were tdTomato+), further confirming that Dbh+ neurons were activated 229 upon allergen challenges to lung (Fig. 3e, f, N=8 sections). 230\nAblation or inactivation of Dbh+ neurons in the nTS blunted airway hyperreactivity 231 To determine if Dbh+ nTS neurons are necessary for mediating allergen response, we 232 employed three approaches. First, we performed chemical ablation by injecting anti-DBH 233 antibody conjugated to the toxin Saporin (SAP). DBH-SAP was previously validated to 234 specifically ablate DBH+ neurons with no effects on neighboring neurons 41. We injected anti-235 DBH-SAP stereotactically into both sides of the nTS of wild-type mice before allergen challenge 236 (Fig. 4a). Compared to scrambled peptide-conjugated SAP (blank-SAP) control, anti-DBH-SAP 237 group showed a clear reduction of DBH+ neurons after injection, confirming ablation efficiency 238 (Fig. 4b). There is little change in the size of other excitatory nTS neuronal subsets as labeled by 239 their specific markers, including Gli3 (Cluster 2), Sncg (Cluster 5), Slc17a7 (Cluster 9) or Mafa 240 (Cluster 12), confirming ablation specificity (Extended Data Fig. 12a-f). Following HDM 241 treatment, the anti-DBH-SAP injected group showed reduced FOS+ cells compared to blank-SAP 242 control (Extended Data Fig. 13a-c). As a baseline control, in flexiVent assays, DBH+ neuron 243 ablation had no effect on methacholine responses in na\u00efve mice not exposed to HDM (Extended 244 Data Fig. 13d-e, N=3 for blank-SAP+Saline, N=4 for anti-DBH-SAP+Saline). In contrast, 245 following HDM challenge, the anti-DBH-SAP treated group showed statistically significant 246 blunted airway hyperreactivity compared to the blank-SAP control group (Fig. 4c, d, N=4 for 247 blank-SAP+HDM, N=9 for anti-DBH-SAP+HDM). 248 Second, we performed genetic ablation by crossing Dbh-cre mice to Rosa-lxl-DTR mice 249 (Dbh-cre; DTR) and then injected DTX bilaterally into nTS (Fig. 4e). This led to efficient loss of 250 Dbh+ neurons in the nTS (Fig. 4f). Following this targeted genetic ablation, we carried out HDM 251 challenge and found that allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity was blunted in the DTX group 252 compared to vehicle-injected control group (Fig. 4g, h, N=10 for vehicle+HDM, N=10 for 253 DTX+HDM). 254 Third, we performed chemogenetic inactivation using Designer Receptors 255 Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) system. We injected AAV-flex-256 hM4D(Gi)-mCherry bilaterally into nTS of Dbh-cre mice, eliciting efficient and specific 257 expression in the nTS, but not nearby regions such as AP (Fig. 4i, Extended Data Fig. 16a, b). 258 Following robust expression, we started the HDM regimen and administered Clozapine-N-Oxide 259 (CNO) to activate hM4D(Gi) before the 2nd to the 4th HDM, sparing the first HDM to allow for 260 sensitization of the immune system which is required for subsequent activation of the nervous 261 system 3. We found that the CNO group showed blunted airway hyperreactivity response 262 compared to vehicle group (Fig. 4j, k, N=5 for HDM+vehicle, N=9 for HDM+CNO). Taking 263 together, data from chemical ablation, genetic ablation and chemogenetic inactivation 264 demonstrate that Dbh+ nTS neurons constitute an essential node of the circuit critical for 265 allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity. 266\n267 Activation of Dbh+ neurons in the nTS induced airway hyperreactivity 268 To address if Dbh+ neurons in the nTS are sufficient for mediating allergen response, we 269 used DREADD targeted activation. We injected AAV-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry into bilateral 270 nTS of Dbh-cre mice, eliciting efficient and specific expression in the nTS (Fig. 4l, Extended 271 Data Fig. 17a). Following this robust expression, we started the HDM regimen and administrated 272 CNO in place of the 4th HDM challenge while all groups received the 1st to the 3rd doses of 273 HDM. The flexiVent data showed that while not to the full extent as HDM, CNO activation of 274 Dbh+ neurons in place of the 4th dose was sufficient to induce increased airway hyperreactivity 275 compared to saline control (Fig. 4m, n, N=5 for 4th HDM, N=11 for 4th CNO, N=8 for 4th 276 Vehicle). In contrast, in na\u00efve mice not exposed to HDM, CNO activation (the 4th dose) of Dbh+ 277 neurons had no effect (Extended Data Fig. 17b-d, N=3 for 4th Saline+vehicle, N=5 for 4th 278\nSaline+CNO). Taking both loss- and gain-of-function data together, these findings suggest that 279 the activity of Dbh+ neurons in the nTS is both necessary and sufficient for mediating allergen-280 induced airway hyperreactivity. 281 In none of the three loss-of-function experiments, nor the chemogenetic gain-of-function 282 experiment did we observe any changes in HDM-induced goblet cell metaplasia, increased 283 immune cell infiltration or expression of Il4, Il5 and Il13 (Extended Data Fig. 14a-f, 15a-f, 16c-i, 284 18a-h). These findings together confirm findings from TRAP2; Ai14; DTR mice (Extended Data 285 Fig. 6a-i). We also assayed for possible effects on other aspects of lung function. Following 286 either HDM challenge or CNO-activation, compared to saline controls, we found no significant 287 difference in minute ventilation, respiratory frequency, tidal volume, or metabolic rate, as 288 measured by plethysmography (Extended Data Fig. 19a-g). This is consistent with previous 289 report that HDM challenge in mice did not change respiratory parameters 42. These results 290 indicate that CNO activation of Dbh+ nTS neurons induced airway hyperreactivity in sensitized 291 airways without affecting respiration. 292\n293 Parasympathetic neurons in the NA are downstream of Dbh+ nTS and upstream of airway-294 innervating postganglionic neurons 295 To map the downstream targets of Dbh+ nTS neurons and their role in mediating allergen-296 induced airway hyperreactivity, we injected AAV-flex-tdTomato to the nTS of Dbh-cre mice 297 (Fig. 5a). No fiber was detected in either the trachea or the lung, indicating that Dbh+ nTS 298 neurons do not innervate the airway directly. We then sectioned and screened the whole 299 brainstem and found that tdTomato+ fibers project to the NA which is composed of Chat+ 300 neurons (Fig. 5b). Our data suggest that Dbh+ nTS neurons project to the NA. 301 To address if NA neurons project directly to lung, we first stereotaxically injected AAV-flex-302 tdTomato to the NA of Chat-cre mice (Fig. 5c). Both light-sheet imaging of intact 303 trachea/bronchi/lung (Fig. 5d, e) and confocal imaging of thick sections (Fig. 5f) revealed that 304 NA-originated tdTomato+ fibers project to postganglionic parasympathetic ganglia residing in 305 both the trachea and the bronchi, rather than directly to smooth muscle cells in lung (Extended 306 Data Fig. 20a-e). In comparison, stereotaxic injection of AAV-flex-Tom into the DMV and the 307 nearby 12N of Chat-cre mice labeled fibers that passed by the space between the trachea and the 308 esophagus without innervating the trachea or the bronchi (Extended Data Fig. 20f, g). 309 To confirm NA to postganglionic neuron connection from the retrograde direction, we 310 introduced retrograde tracing dye CTB488 dorsal to the trachea, where postganglionic 311 parasympathetic ganglia are enriched. In whole brainstem sections, we found CTB488 labeling 312 of Chat+ neurons in the NA region, with little cell body labeling in other regions including the 313 DMV and the 12N (Fig. 5g). 314 To directly address the role of Chat+ neurons in the NA in mediating allergen-induced airway 315 hyperreactivity, we utilized the DREADD system. To inactivate Chat+ neurons in the NA, we 316 injected AAV-flex-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry bilaterally into NA of Chat-cre mice (Fig. 5h, i). We 317 found that the CNO group showed blunted airway resistance and elastance responses compared 318 to the vehicle-injected control group (Fig. 5j, k, N=7 for HDM+vehicle, N=7 for HDM+CNO). 319 Conversely, to specifically activate Chat+ neurons in the NA, we injected AAV-DIO-320 hM3D(Gq)-mCherry bilaterally into NA of Chat-cre mice (Fig. 5l, m). While not as potent as 321 HDM, activation of Chat+ NA neurons by CNO is sufficient to induce increased airway 322 hyperreactivity compared to saline (Fig. 5n, o, N=6 for 4th HDM, N=13 for 4th CNO, N=6 for 4th 323 Vehicle). In na\u00efve mice not exposed to HDM, we found that CNO activation of Chat+ NA 324 neurons had no added effect on airway constriction under increasing doses of methacholine 325 (Extended Data Fig. 21a-c, N=3 for 4th Saline+vehicle, N=6 for 4th Saline+CNO). 326\nPrevious studies have shown that DMV, a key node of autonomic control 43, is also a target 327 of nTS neurons 43,44. To test if DMV may also act downstream of Dbh+ nTS neurons in the 328 allergen circuit, we performed DREADD-based inactivation or activation of Chat+ neurons in 329 the DMV (Extended Data Fig. 22a, d). In contrast to results from the NA, these DMV 330 perturbations showed little effect in modulating HDM-induced airway hyperreactivity (Extended 331 Data Fig. 22b, c, e, f). 332 Our data together indicate that Chat+ neurons in the NA are necessary and sufficient in 333 mediating allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity. 334\n335 Single nucleus transcriptomic signatures of the NA allow dissection of allergen signaling 336 relay 337 To determine the molecular nature of the signaling relay leading to NA activation, we 338 utilized snRNA-seq to define NA neuron signatures. As all NA neurons express Chat, in the 339 brainstem of Chat-cre; CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice, we collected around the small GFP+ region that 340 corresponds to NA, and avoided DMV and 12N regions which are also GFP+. Among all the 341 neurons identified in the snRNAseq dataset, we focused on the 190 Chat+ neurons, which 342 segregated into 3 clusters as shown in the UMAP plot (Fig. 6a). Individual neuronal populations 343 were distinguished by marker genes (Fig. 6b), which were verified by UMAP plots and caudal 344 brainstem in situ hybridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas (Fig. 6c-h). Our neuron number 345 and neuron type clusters are comparable to the two recent published NA single cell datasets 45,46. 346 The addition of snRNA-seq signature of this downstream node of the allergen circuit allowed 347 us to define an in silico molecular pathway that starts from the lung and back to the lung 348 (Extended Data Fig. 23a-c). Given our finding that allergen-induced Fos activation is reduced in 349 mast cell mutants and following anti-IL-4 antibody neutralization (Fig. 1d-h), we started with 350 key immune signals from type 2 immune cells. Our previous findings also indicate that 351 pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are essential for amplifying allergen-induced 352 responses 25. Thus, we added key PNEC products. In the next node the vagal ganglia, we focused 353 on Trpv1+ population because its ablation led to reduced airway hyperreactivity in allergen-354 challenged mice 3. By analyzing published snRNA-seq datasets of the vagal ganglia 7,8,47,48, we 355 found multiple corresponding receptors for immune cell and PNEC ligands in Trpv1+ vagal 356 populations (Extended Data Fig. 23a). 357 We then paired ligands from Trpv1+ vagal neurons and receptors in Dbh+ neurons in the nTS 358 from our snRNA-seq dataset, and ligands from Dbh+ nTS neurons and receptors in the next 359 downstream node using our snRNA-seq datasets (Extended Data Fig. 23b, c). Given that both 360 NA neurons and their downstream airway smooth muscle-innervating postganglionic neurons are 361 Chat+, the ligands from both of these neuron groups are likely acetylcholine 49-51. Taken 362 together, this analysis revealed candidate signals for this neuroimmune circuit that relays from 363 lung immune cells, neurons in the vagal ganglia, nTS and NA of the brainstem, trachea/bronchi, 364 and airway smooth muscle cells. 365 366 Blocking norepinephrine receptors in the NA blunted allergen-induced airway 367 hyperreactivity 368 To test the function of signals predicted from our ligand-receptor analysis, we focused on the 369 nTS-NA relay. Dbh encodes a key enzyme that converts dopamine to norepinephrine, leading to 370 the hypothesis that within the allergen circuit, norepinephrine may be the signal between Dbh+ 371 nTS and NA. From analysis of the NA snRNA-seq dataset and RNAscope analysis, among all 372 norepinephrine receptor genes, only Adra1a and Adra1b are expressed in Chat+ neurons in the 373 NA (Fig. 6i-l). Furthermore, we found that retrograde tracing by tracheal injection of CTB488 374\nlabeled Adra1a+ and Adra1b+ neurons in the NA (Fig. 6m, n). These data support that 375 norepinephrine receptor-expressing NA neurons are in the airway circuit, and may receive 376 norepinephrine signals from Dbh+ nTS neurons in response to allergen challenges. 377 To test this hypothesis, we addressed whether blocking norepinephrine signal reception in the 378 NA can blunt airway hyperreactivity. Either Prazosin or Terazosin, two norepinephrine receptor 379 antagonists specific for ADRA1, were individually infused into NA bilaterally through implanted 380 cannula (Fig. 6o, Extended Data Fig. 24a). Compared to vehicle control, targeted administration 381 of Prazosin or Terazosin significantly blunted airway hyperreactivity response (Fig. 6p, q, N=6 382 for HDM+vehicle, N=7 for HDM+Prazosin, N=6 for HDM+Terazosin). These results indicate 383 that the activity of norepinephrine receptor in the NA is necessary for mediating allergen-384 induced airway hyperreactivity, demonstrating the molecular nature of this key relay in the 385 allergen response circuit. 386\n387 Discussion 388 In this study, our findings delineate a full neural circuit where chronic allergen challenges to 389 lung are transmitted through immune cells such as IL-4 producing immune cells and ascending 390 vagal afferents to a Dbh+ subset of the nTS central integrator, which acts through descending 391 efferent neurons (Adra1a+/Adra1b+) in the NA before projecting back to postganglionic neurons 392 innervating the airway to control airway hyperreactivity (Fig. 6r). This is a circuit identified in 393 wild-type mice following repeated conditioning by allergen, suggesting the presence of an 394 intrinsic molecular and cellular response machinery. Recurring irritation is a common cause of 395 chronic diseases and repeated allergen exposure is central to asthma pathogenesis. Our findings 396 reveal a disease-relevant circuit with players from the immune system, the nervous system and 397 functional cells of the organ. 398 We found that only repeated, but not single, allergen challenges led to a statistically 399 significant increase in activated nTS neurons. This exemplifies a cardinal feature of chronic 400 conditioning, a behavior that is distinct from mechanisms that drive acute airway constriction 401 2,52,53. These results provide an example of experience-driven neural plasticity in peripheral 402 interoceptive circuits, which are analogous to features classically showcased by central nervous 403 system neurons in learning and memory. 404 While methacholine can induce acute airway constriction in both groups, repeated allergen 405 challenge led to exacerbated response above the level in na\u00efve animals. Our data demonstrate 406 that this elevated airway resistance was blunted by ablation or chemogenetic inactivation of 407 Dbh+ nTS neurons, demonstrating for the first time the critical role of the nTS neurons in this 408 response. Despite differences, airway hyperreactivity and acute airway constriction may share 409 overlapping nodes. Activation of nervous system in na\u00efve animals, by either electrical 410 stimulation of vagal C-fiber, chemical induction of MrgprC11+ vagal neurons, or optogenetic 411 stimulation of thoracic cholinergic nerves, induced acute airway constriction in the absence of 412 exogenous methacholine 26,52,53. These findings suggest that repeated allergen exposures may 413 hijack these existing nodes, condition them through molecular changes or anatomical 414 remodeling, to elevate airway constriction above the threshold level of acute response, 415 mimicking asthma. Our results further define the identity of the brainstem neurons that connect 416 the afferent and efferent nodes to control airway constriction. 417 While the combined connectivity is necessary and sufficient for allergen-induced 418 hyperactivity, individual nodes of this allergen circuit may also function in other physiological or 419 pathological settings. For example, Dbh-expressing nTS neurons were implicated in appetite 420 control by projecting to the lateral parabrachial nucleus or in the arcuate nucleus of the 421 hypothalamus 54-56. Dissecting the anatomical connectivity and the pairing of 422\nneurotransmitter/neuropeptide to their receptors are key to unraveling the different roles of the 423 same neuron type in distinct circuits. Towards this goal, our snRNA-seq datasets of the nTS and 424 NA provide the basis for dissecting molecular connectivity and specificity. In the context of the 425 allergen circuit, these two datasets, together with existing lung and vagal neuron single cell 426 datasets, and the knowledge that acetylcholine is the likely neurotransmitter from NA to airway 427 smooth muscle cells, complete the connectome of the allergen circuit (Extended Data Fig. 23a-c) 428 7,8,47,48. Two recent studies delineated diverse functions of NA neurons in targeting the 429 esophagus, the heart and/or the lung 45,46. It is likely that the cardiopulmonary subset of the NA 430 neurons is responsible for mediating allergen response. 431 The molecular signatures of the allergen hyperreactivity circuit enables a novel dimension for 432 modulating airway tone in asthma. Neuromodulation could bypass the systemic side effects of 433 current asthma treatments that relay on administration of steroids and biologics. This adaptive 434 circuit showcases the importance of neuroimmune control of organ function. Beyond the lung, 435 mapping how organs act through their peripheral and central nerve connections to receive, 436 process and respond to chronic inputs will open a new dimension in the modulation of disease-437 relevant interoceptive activities. 438 439\nMethods 440 Mice 441 All experimental procedures were performed in the American Association for Accreditation 442 of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-certified laboratory animal facility at the University of 443 California, San Diego (UCSD). All animal husbandry and experiments were conducted under 444 approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. Adult (8-16 445 weeks) mice from strains: C57BL/6J (wild-type, JAX 000664), c-Kitw-sh/w-sh (JAX 030764), 446 Fos2A-iCreER (TRAP2, JAX 030323), Rosa-lxl-tdTomato (Ai14, JAX 007914), Rosa-lxl-DTR (JAX 447 016603), Chat-cre (JAX 031661) and CAG-Sun1/sfGFP (JAX 030952) lines were purchased 448 from the Jackson lab. Dbh-cre (MMRRC 036778) line was purchased from the Mutant Mouse 449 Resource and Research Center (MMRRC). All the cre lines we used in this study were kept in 450 B6 background. All cre driver lines used are viable and fertile, and no abnormal phenotypes 451 were detected. We crossed cre males to B6 wild-type females, and both male and female mice 452 were used in the experiment. Mice were at least six-week-old when performing HDM challenge 453 or doing stereotaxic injection or surgery. 454 455 House Dust Mite (HDM) challenge 456 Adult mice were anesthetized using isoflurane, 50 \u03bcg/20 \u03bcl of HDM extract 457 (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, GREER Labs) was introduced intranasally weekly continuous 458 for 4 weeks on Days 0, 7, 14, and 21. For controls, 20 \u03bcl saline was administered intranasally on 459 the same schedule instead of HDM. Mice were sacrificed 1.5 hours after the 4th challenge for Fos 460 in situ hybridization or nTS single-nucleus RNA sequencing, 2 hours after the 4th challenge for 461 FOS antibody immunostaining, 24 hours after the 4th challenge for flexiVent assay, periodic 462 acid\u2013schiff (PAS) staining and quantitative PCR (qPCR), 3 days after the 4th challenge for flow 463 cytometry. 464 465 Histology preparation and PAS staining 466 Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Lungs were inflated with 4 % paraformaldehyde 467 (PFA) at 35 cm H2O airway pressure, fixed overnight and then prepared for paraffin sections at 6 468 \u03bcm. Goblet cells were stained using a PAS staining kit (Sigma). 469\n470 Tissue collection and immunofluorescence staining 471 Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Mice were then transcardinally perfused with 472 Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by perfusion fixation with 4% PFA. The brainstems 473 were harvested and post-fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 4 % PFA. After fixing, tissues were washed 474 three times in PBS followed by overnight sucrose dehydration. The brainstem or the lung were 475 then cryo-embedded in OCT compound following standard procedure. Brainstem blocks were 476 sectioned at 20 \u03bcm or 40 \u03bcm in rostral to caudal sequence, lung blocks were sectioned at 300 \u03bcm 477 for parasympathetic neurons/airway staining. All the sections were then processed for 478 immunostaining following a standard protocol. Primary antibodies used include rabbit anti-c-479 FOS (SYSY, 226 003), rabbit anti-DBH (Sigma, AB1585), rabbit anti-Dsred (Takara, 632496), 480 rabbit anti-VAChT (SYSY, 139 103), mouse anti-alpha Smooth Muscle Actin-FITC (Sigma, 481 F3777). Secondary antibodies used include goat anti-rabbit FITC, goat anti-rabbit Cy3, goat anti-482 rabbit Cy5 (all from Jackson Immuno Research Labs). Slides were mounted using Vectashield 483 (Vector Labs) and imaged using the Olympus VS200 Slide Scanner or the Leica SP8 confocal 484 microscope. For quantification of FOS+ (Fig. 1c, e, h, j, Extended Data Fig. 3c, f, i, Extended 485 Data Fig. 13c) or tdTomato+ (Fig. 1p and Extended Data Fig. 5c) cells in the nTS, or Fos+ cells 486 after RNAscope in situ hybridization (Extended Data Fig. 12f), we did serial section of the whole 487 nTS and counted from three cryosections (three sections were chosen coordinate between 488 Bregma -7.20 mm and -8.08 mm with the same stereotaxic, where HDM-induced FOS+ cells are 489 elevated) with the maximal numbers of FOS+ cells and count the average number as one data 490 point for one animal. We used Qupath for overlap quantification in the nTS (Fig. 3d, f). 491 492 RNAscope in situ hybridization 493 To prepare nTS sections for RNAscope in situ hybridization, fresh brainstems were cryo-494 embedded in OCT compound. Sections at 12 \u03bcm were prepared using a cryostat, collected on 495 Superfrost Plus slides, and left to dry in the cryostat for at least 30 minutes before staining. All 496 staining procedures were performed using RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Kit (Advanced Cell 497 Diagnostics, 320850) following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Briefly, sections were post-fixed 498 in 4% PFA for 1 hour at room temperature, washed in PBS, dehydrated in a series of ethanol 499 washes, and then dried. A hydrophobic barrier was drawn around the section with an ImmEdge 500 pen (Vector Lab, H-4000). The sections were treated with Protease IV in a HybEZ Humidity 501 Control Tray for 30 minutes at room temperature, incubated with target probes in a HybEZ Oven 502 for 2 hours at 40\u00b0C, and then treated with Hybridize Amp buffer. Slides were mounted using 503 Fluoromount-G with DAPI (Southern Biotech). The following probes from Advanced Cell 504 Diagnostics were used: Mm-Fos (316921), Mm-Dbh (407851), Mm-Gil3 (445511), Mm-Sncg 505 (482741), Mm-Slc17a7 (431201), Mm-Mafa (556931), Mm-Fos (316921), Mm-Cnr1(420721), 506 Mm-Th (317621), Mm-Cck (402271), Mm-tdTomato (317041), Mm-Chat (408731), Mm-507 Adra1a (408611), Mm-Adra1b (413561), Mm-Adra2a (425341), Mm-Adra2b (425321), Mm-508 Adrb1 (449761), Mm-Adrb2 (449771) and Mm-Adrb3 (495521). 509\n510 Vagotomy 511 Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) via 512 intraperitoneal injection. Fully anesthetized mice were secured in the sternal position to the 513 homoeothermic blanket using lab tape. Spread 75 % EtOH on the throat of the mouse to wet the 514 fur. Lift the skin to make a vertical cut (1 cm) on the throat, isolate one side of vagal nerve and 515 tease away from carotid artery using small, curved forceps. Pass fine, curved forceps underneath 516\nthe vagal nerve and slowly open forceps to separate the nerve fiber from the surrounding tissue. 517 Unilateral vagotomy was conducted by lifting up the vagal nerve and cutting with straight 518 scissors. Control sham operations are simulated by lifting the vagal nerve and releasing it intact. 519 After vagotomy, the wounds were closed carefully with sterilized dissecting scissors and suture 520 strings. The area will be cleaned with 75% EtOH and disinfected with Povidone-Iodine. The time 521 between fully anesthesia and completion of the surgery should take less than 10 minutes. 522 Buprenorphine SR (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) was used for pain relief following 523 surgery. One week after surgery, mice were used for allergen challenge. 524 525 4-OH tamoxifen injection and TRAP2 labeling 526 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, Sigma H6278) was dissolved at 20 mg/mL in ethanol by 527 shaking at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes and was then aliquoted and stored at -20\u00b0C for up to several 528 weeks. Before use, 4-OHT was redissolved in ethanol by shaking at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes, a 1:4 529 mixture of castor oil: sunflower seed oil (Sigma, 259853 and S5007) was added to give a final 530 concentration of 10 mg/mL 4-OHT, and the ethanol was evaporated by vacuum under 531 centrifugation. All injections were delivered intraperitoneally to adult TRAP2 mice. Mice were 532 kept in their home cage for additional 1 week to allow the expression of tdTomato before 533 treatment. 534 535 CLARITY-based brain clearing 536 A hydrogel based on 1 % acrylamide (1 % acrylamide, 0.125 % Bis, 4 % PFA, 0.025 % 537 (w/v) VA-044 initiator, in 1X PBS) was used for all CLARITY preparations. Mice were 538 transcardially perfused with 4 % PFA. After perfusion, brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA 539 overnight at 4\u00b0C and then transferred to 1 % hydrogel for 48 hours to allow monomer diffusion. 540 The samples were degassed and polymerized (4-5 hours at 37\u00b0C) in a 50 ml tube. The brains 541 were removed from hydrogel and washed with 200 mM NaOH-Boric buffer (pH=8.5) containing 542 8 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 6-12 hours to remove residual PFA and monomers. Brains 543 could then be transferred to a flow-assisted clearing device using a temperature-control circulator 544 or a simpler combination of 50 ml tube and heated stirring plate. 100 mM Tris-Boric Buffer 545 (pH=8.5) containing 8 % SDS was used to accelerate the clearing (at 40\u00b0C). A whole mouse 546 brain can be cleared in 12-16 days. After clearing, the brain was washed in PBST (PBS+0.2% 547 Triton X) for at least 24 hours at 37\u00b0C to remove residual SDS. Brains were incubated in a 548 refractive index matching solution (RI=1.45) for 8 hours (up to 1 day) at 37\u00b0C and then 6-8 549 hours at room temperature. After the incubation, brainstem hemispheres were imaged using 550 confocal microscope. 551 552 Brainstem stereotaxic injection 553 Fully anesthetized mice (ketamine at 100 mg/kg and xylazine at 10 mg/kg via intraperitoneal 554 injection) were placed in a stereotaxic frame with the head angled at 45\u00b0 and body temperature 555 maintained with a heating pad. A midline incision was made though the animal\u2019s skin, posterior 556 neck muscles, and dura mater to expose the medulla between the occipital bone and C1 vertebra. 557 Based on the stereotaxic coordinates of mouse brain 57 and using Obex as a reference point, 558 bilateral injections were made into the nTS (0.1 mm rostral to Obex, 0.2 mm lateral to midline, 559 0.25 mm under the medullary surface), the DMV (0.05 mm caudal to Obex, 0.1 mm lateral to 560 midline, 0.1 mm under the medullary surface), or the NA (0.65 mm caudal to Obex, 1.25 mm 561 lateral to midline, 0.45 mm under the medullary surface) using a calibrated glass micropipette 562 attached to a Nanoject II injector (Drummond) microprocessor pump (Pneumatic PicoPump; 563 WPI). Over 5 minutes, DTX (2 ng/200 nl), anti-DBH-SAP (42 ng/200 nL, advanced targeting 564\nsystem, IT-03), blank-SAP (advanced targeting system, IT-21), or viruses (50 nl for nTS or 565 DMV, 20 nl for NA, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital Vector Core) were gradually injected at the 566 targeted site of TRAP2 mice, wild-type mice, Dbh-cre or Chat-cre mice, respectively. Viruses 567 include AAV2/9-flex-tdTomato (1.3x1013 genome copies (gc)/ml), AAV2/8-flex-hM4D(Gi)-568 mCherry (2.07x1013 gc/ml), AAV2/8-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (8x1012 gc/ml). After injection, 569 the glass micropipette was left in place for 10 minutes to limit nonspecific spread of the toxin or 570 virus. The micropipette was pulled out very slowly. Buprenorphine SR (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous 571 injection) was used for pain relief following surgery. The mice were allowed to recover from 572 anesthesia on a heating blanket before returning to the home cage. 573 574 Airway hyperreactivity assayed by flexiVent 575 Anesthetized (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, intraperitoneal injection) mice 576 were paralyzed with acepromazine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) and then tracheotomized 577 with a 20G sterile catheter, attached to a flexiVent pulmonary mechanics apparatus (SCIREQ). 578 Mice were ventilated at a tidal volume of 9 ml/kg with a frequency of 150 bpm. Positive end-579 expiratory pressure was set at 300 mm H2O. Lung resistance (Rrs) and elastance (Ers) of the 580 respiratory system were determined in response to aerosolized methacholine challenges (0, 6, 12 581 and 24 mg/ml). All mice used were adults of similar age and weight. The weight of each animal 582 was entered into flexiVent at the start of each round of assay. As part of the flexiVent program, 583 pre-scans were carried out that led to calculation of lung size. Methacholine was dissolved in 584 sterile saline. The nebulizer was on for 10 seconds to deliver each dose of methacholine. The 585 mean maximal elastance and resistance of twelve measurements by doses was calculated. 586 Samples were compared using two-way ANOVA. Statistical analysis at each methacholine 587 concentration was performed separately. Error bars represent means \u00b1 SEM. Statistical 588 significance called at p<0.05. 589\n590 Tissue dissociation and flow cytometry 591 Three days after last challenge, mice were anesthetized (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg 592 xylazine, intraperitoneal injection) and then injected with AF700-counjugated CD45 through 593 intravenous injection to distinguish circulating immune cells and immune cells resident within 594 the lung. Mice were euthanized 5 minutes later for lung harvest. Whole lungs were mechanically 595 dissociated in GentleMACS C tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) containing 5 ml of PRMI 1640 (Thermo 596 Scientific) with 10 % FBS, 1 mM HEPES (Life Technology), 1 mM MgCl2 (Life Technology), 1 597 mM CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.525 mg/ml collagenase/dispase (Roche) and 0.25 mg DNase I 598 (Roche) by running mouse lung 1-2 program on GentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). Lung pieces 599 were then digested by shaking (~150 rpm) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. After incubation, Lung pieces 600 were mechanically dissociated further using mouse lung 2-1 program on GentleMACS, followed 601 by straining through a 70 mm filter. Red blood cells were removed by adding 1 mL RBC lysis 602 buffer (Biolegend) to each tube and incubate at room temperature for 1 minute. 603 The single-cell suspensions from above were then pelleted (1500 rpm, 4\u00b0C, 5 minutes), 604 counted with hemocytometer and diluted to around 1 \u00d7 106 cells per ml. They were stained with 605 Fc blocking antibody (5 mg/ml, BD) at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes. The cells were washed with DPBS 606 and then incubated with surface marker antibody cocktail for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. For flow 607 cytometry of lung myeloid, the following antibodies were used (all antibodies were from 608 BioLegend): 1:100 AF488-conjugated anti-F4/80; 1:500 BV510-conjugated anti-CD45; 1:500 609 BV605-counjugated anti-Siglec-F; 1:100 V450-counjugateed anti-TCR-beta; 1:200 V450-610 counjugated anti-B220; 1:1000 PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-Ly6C; 1:2000 PE-conjugated anti-611 MHC-II; 1:1000 APC-conjugated anti-CD11c; 1:1000 PE-Cy7 conjugated anti-Ly6G; 1:2000 612\nPE-CF594-counjugated CD11b. For flow cytometry of lung lymphoid, the following antibodies 613 were used (all antibodies were from BioLegend): 1:200 FITC-conjugated anti-CD45; 1:100 AP-614 Cy7-counjugateed anti-IL7Ra; V450-counjugated Lineage mix (1:200 anti-CD19; 1:500 anti-615 CD11c; 1:500 anti F4/80; 1:100 anti-NK1.1; 1:100 anti-TER119; 1:100 anti-TCR gamma delta); 616 1:100 BV510-conjugated anti-ST2; 1:200 PE-Cy7-counjugated anti-TCR-beta; 1:100 BV604-617 counjugated anti-CD4; 1:2000 PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-CD90.2; 1:100 APC-conjugated 618 anti-cKit; 1:2000 PE-CF594-counjugated anti-CD11b; 1:200 PE-conjugated anti-MAR.1. The 619 cells were then stained using live/dead dye (1:1000, Ghost Dye Red 780, TONBO biosciences 620 for myeloid, 1:500, Ghost Dye Violet 450, TONBO biosciences for lymphoid) for 30 minutes at 621 4\u00b0C. The cells were fixed using BD Stabilizing Fixative for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C before transferring 622 to FACs tubes. Flow cytometry was analyzed on BD FACS Canto RUO - ORANGE with three 623 lasers (405 nm, 488 nm and 640 nm) using the Flow Cytometry Core at the VA San Diego 624 Health Care System and the San Diego Veterans Medical Research Foundation. All data were 625 further analyzed and plotted with FlowJo software (Tree Star). Eosinophils, innate lymphoid 626 cells (ILC2s) and Th2 cells were gated on live, resident CD45+ singlets. 627 628 Isolation of nuclei from frozen nTS 629 We dissected out the whole nTS region from adult C57BL6/J male mice brainstem. Mice 630 were euthanized using CO2 inhalation. Brains were acutely harvested from two groups of wild-631 type males (WT), or from two adult saline- or HDM-challenged males at 1.5 hours after the 4th 632 challenge, respectively (two technical replicates in every group). The nTS was visualized by 633 microscopy and harvested based on anatomical landmarks. Dissected nTS were put in liquid N2 634 immediately and store at -80\u00b0C or proceed directly to nuclei isolation. On the day of nuclei 635 dissociation, plunge the dounce and pestle in ice. Transfer douncing buffer (DB, 0.25 M sucrose, 636 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH=7.5) to the dounce in ice and let them chill. 637 Transfer dissected nTS into dounce which includes 1 mL DB with 1 mM DTT (D9779, Sigma), 638 1x cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (05056489001, Roche, DB-DP) with 0.1% Triton-X. 639 Use loose pestle 5-10 times gently followed by 15-20 stokes with tight pestle, without 640 introducing bubbles. After filter with 30 \u03bcm CellTrics, transfer the contents to pre-chilled low 641 bind Eppendorf tube. Spin at 1,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant and gently 642 resuspend in 1 mL of DB-DP. Spin at 1,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Remove supernatant and 643 gently resuspend in 1 mL permeabilization buffer (BSA, 5% IGEPAL-CA630 (I8896, Sigma), 644 0.2% DTT, 1 mM cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor, 1xPBS). Resuspend in 50-500 \u00b5L of 645 1.11x tagmentation buffer (66 mM Tris-acetate (pH=7.8, BP-152, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 132 646 mM K-acetate (P5708, Sigma), 20 mM Mg-acetate (M2545, Sigma) and 32 mM DMF (DX1730, 647 EMD Millipore). Count with hemocytometer. 648 649 Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and data analysis 650 Single-nucleus RNA sequencing experiments were provided by the Center for Epigenomics, 651 University of California, San Diego. nTS nuclei were processed into cDNA libraries using 652 Chromium Single Cell 3' v3 kit (10XGenomics). Sequencing was carried out on NovaSeq 653 (Illumina) platform at the Institute for Genomic Medicine, University of California, San Diego 654 (UCSD). CellRanger package (version 3.0.2) was used to align the raw reads onto the mouse 655 reference genome (GRCm38) and generate the feature-barcode matrix. CellBender was used next 656 to model and remove systematic biases and background noise, and to produce improved 657 estimates of gene expression. Next, R package Seurat (version 4.0) was used to perform data 658 quality control, normalization, principal components analysis and uniform manifold 659 approximation and projection (UMAP method). For raw data from WT, Saline or HDM 660\nconditions, we firstly used SCTransform to regress our batch effects and did doublets removal 661 separately. We then integrated all the data from three conditions (WT, Saline, HDM) using 662 Harmony. Cells with 3,500 to 5,500 unique feature counts were considered high quality cells and 663 used for further analysis. The integrated dataset was normalized, scaled, and then analyzed for 664 variable genes using Seurat\u2019s NormalizeData, ScaleData, and FindVariableFeatures functions, 665 respectively. A total of 2,000 top variable features were identified by function 666 FindVariableFeatures and selected for subsequent principal components analysis. Top 20 667 significant components were chosen to conduct cell clustering by using the algorithm of uniform 668 manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) with default settings. The expression level and 669 feature of selected genes were profiled and visualize by R package ggplot2 (Version 3.3.2). We 670 then read snRNA-seq data from WT condition and profiled dot plot and UMAP plot of marker 671 gene expression in all the nTS clusters (Fig. 2a-q, Extended Data Fig. 7a-o, Extended Data Fig. 672 8a). We compared snRNA-seq data from Saline and HDM conditions and profiled dot plot of 673 Fos in all the nTS clusters (Fig. 3a, b, Extended Data Fig. 8b). 674 675 Quantitative PCR (qPCR) 676 Total RNA was extracted from lungs using Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy Mini RNA 677 extraction kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was then performed to obtain corresponding cDNA using 678 iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed by CFX ConnectTM system 679 (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green (Bio-Rad). At least three technical and three biological replicates 680 were performed for each gene if not otherwise notated. Samples were compared using unpaired 681 student\u2019s t-test. Error bars represent means \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance called at p<0.05. 682 683 Primers 684 685\nGene name Sequence\nActb (\u03b2-actin) 5\u02b9-CGGCCAGGTCATCACTATTGGCAAC-3\u02b9 5\u2032-GCCACAGGATTCCATACCCAAGAAG-3\u2032\nMuc5ac 5\u02b9-TGACTCAATCTGCGTGCCTT-3\u02b9 5\u2032-AGGCCTTCTTTTGGCAGGTT-3\u2032\nIl4 5\u2019-GGTCTCAACCCCCAGCTAGT-3\u2019 5\u2019-GCCGATGATCTCTCTCAAGTGAT-3\u2019\nIl5 5\u2032-CCTCTTCGTTGCATCAGGGT-3\u2032 5\u2032-GATCCTCCTGCGTCCATCTG-3\u2032\nIl13 5\u2032-AAAGCAACTGTTTCGCCACG-3\u2032 5\u2032-CCTCTCCCCAGCAAAGTCTG-3\u2032\n686 nTS-targeted SAP injections 687 Mice received bilateral injections of either unconjugated blank-SAP or SAP conjugated to an 688 antibody directed to DBH (DBH-SAP; 42 ng/200 nL, pH=7.4; MAB394; Millipore, Temecula, 689 CA, USA), using a Hamilton syringe directed toward the nTS (0.1 mm rostral to Obex, 0.2 mm 690 lateral to midline, 0.25 mm under the medullary surface). Blank-SAP cannot enter cells and is 691 non-toxic to neurons, serving as the appropriate control for DBH-SAP administration. Over 5 692 minutes, 50 nL of blank-SAP or DBH-SAP was gradually injected to the nTS. DBH-SAP was 693 previously validated to specifically ablate DBH+ neurons with no effects on neighboring neurons 694 41. Upon specific binding to DBH at the synaptic cleft of DBH+ cells, the complex including 695\nconjugated anti-DBH-SAP antibody is endocytosed and transported back to the cell body 58. In 696 the cell body, the SAP toxin inactivates ribosomes, leading to cell death 59. As previously 697 published studies indicate that 2 weeks is necessary to eliminate Dbh+ neurons using DBH-SAP 698 58, mice were injected 1 week before the 1st HDM sensitization and 2 weeks before the 2nd 699 challenge. 700 701 Plethysmography 702 Ventilatory parameters during normoxia was measured in unrestrained male mice using a 703 whole-body barometric plethysmograph (500 mL) modified for continuous flow 60-62. Flow was 704 maintained constant through the chamber while a pressure transducer (45 mMP with 2 cm H2O 705 diaphragm, Validyne, Northridge CA) recorded the changes attributable to the warming and 706 expansion of inhaled gases. On the experimental day, the mice were weighed and sealed into an 707 individual plethysmograph chamber along with a temperature and humidity probe (Thermalert 708 TH5, Physitemp, Clifton NJ). A constant gas flow (335 ml/min) was delivered with a rotameter 709 (603, Matheson, Montgomeryville PA) and measured with a flow meter (Sables System 710 International, Inc. Las Vegas, NV) upstream of the chamber. Gases exited the chamber through a 711 valve and into a vacuum pump (Model 25, Precision Scientific Co, Chicago IL) to isolate 712 pressure changes from breathing in the chamber during constant flow with high input and output 713 impedances. This also allows us to maintain chamber pressure near-atmospheric pressure and 714 reference pressure measurements (Validyne) in the chamber to atmosphere. 715 All ventilatory parameters were recorded on an analog-digital acquisition system (PowerLab 716 8SP, AD Instruments) and analyzed with the LabChart 8-Pro Software, sampling at a rate of 1 717 kHz. Mice were allowed to acclimatize to the chamber and constant air flow for 45 minutes (air 718 with 21% of O2) and then exposed to a 5-minute challenge of hypoxic gas (10% O2) to test 719 responsiveness. After that we exposed the mice to normoxic gas for 15 minutes. We analyzed a 720 minimum of 30 seconds as part of the region of interest between 10 and 15 minutes of the las 721 exposure to normoxic gas. The frequency (breaths/min) and tidal volume (ml) were calculated 722 from cyclic peaks in the plethysmograph pressure pulses, and tidal volume was measured using 723 0.02 ml calibration pulses and the equations were developed by Drorbaugh and Fenn 63. We 724 measured minute ventilation (V . I), respiratory frequency (Rf) and tidal volume (Vt). All of them 725 were measured under 21% of oxygen. Minute ventilation (V . I) is the product of frequency and 726 tidal volume, which was normalized to body mass ventilation (ml/min\u00b7kg). We also calculated 727\noxygen consumption (V . O2) and carbon dioxide production (V . CO2) during the ventilation 728 measurement by recording the inspired and expired oxygen and carbon dioxide fractions were 729 measured with an O2/CO2 analyzer (FOXBOX, Sables System International, Inc. Las Vegas, 730 NV) sampling from the chamber, and then calculating inspired and expired O2 and CO2 fractions, 731 chamber flow rate and correcting for water vapor and respiratory quotient (eqn. 10.6 and 10.7 in 732 J.R.B. Lighton, Measuring Metabolic Rates, Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, 2008). Incurrent gases 733 are dry from tanks. Water vapors were scrubbed from excurrent gas when it was analyzed with 734\nthe O2/CO2 analyzer. Thus, we calculated the ratio of V . I / V . O2 and V . I / V . CO2 to have a more 735 precise estimation of the mice ventilation avoiding confounding factors produced by changes in 736 metabolic rate. 737 738 CUBIC tissue clearing and light sheet fluorescence microscopy 739\nCUBIC (Clear, Unobstructed Brain/Body Imaging Cocktails and Computational analysis 740 protocol) buffers were prepared according to Susaki et al 64. After sufficient tissue clearing in R1 741 buffer, tissues were embedded in 2 % low melting agarose and then incubated in R2 solution at 742 room temperature overnight prior to imaging. Cleared samples were imaged using a Zeiss Z.1 743 light sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM). Lung samples were imaged using a 2.5x objective 744 (LSFM 2.5x NA 0.1) and a 1.45 2.5X CLARITY specific chamber (Translucence Biosystems). 745 746 Isolation of nuclei from frozen NA 747 We dissected out the NA region (GFP+) from adult Chat-cre; CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice 748 brainstem under fluorescence microscope. Mice were euthanized using CO2 inhalation. Brains 749 were acutely harvested. The NA was visualized by nucleus localized GFP fluorescence signals 750 and harvested based on anatomical landmarks. We collected GFP+ neurons around NA region 751 and avoided DMV and 12N regions which also express Chat. NA from 7 mice were dissected 752 and pulled together and put in liquid N2 immediately and store at -80\u00b0C or proceed directly to 753 nuclei isolation. We used the same dounce dissociation method that we isolated nTS nuclei (see 754 method-Isolation of nuclei from frozen nTS). 755 756 NA single-nucleus RNA sequencing and data analysis 757 NA nuclei were processed, sequenced and analyzed using the same kit, platform and 758 software that were used for nTS (see method-nTS single-nucleus RNA sequencing and data 759 analysis). For raw data, we firstly confirmed the mitochondrial counts was < 5%, and cells above 760 200 unique feature counts were considered high quality cells and used for further analysis. 761 762 Under trachea injection 763 Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) via 764 intraperitoneal injection. After fully anesthetized, mice were placed ventral side up in a 765 stereotaxic frame with body temperature maintained with a heating pad. Ophthalmic ointment 766 was applied to maintain eye lubrication. The extra thoracic trachea was exposed via a ventral 767 incision in the animal's neck. The trachea was lifted up by forceps carefully without bleed the 768 trachea. Using a 10 \u03bcl Hamilton glass micropipette fitted with a 32G needle, 10 \u03bcl CTB488 769 (concentration at 1 mg/ml, Thermo Scientific, C22841) was injected into the dorsal side of the 770 trachea from bilateral sides, 3 to 5 cartilage rings caudal to the larynx. The injection was done 771 within 15 minutes per mouse. Mouse skin was sutured and recovered on thermal pad before 772 returned to housing. Buprenorphine SR (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) was used 773 for pain relief following surgery. For brainstem collection, mice were sacrificed 1 week after 774 CTB488 injection. 775 776 Cannula implant and microinjection into bilateral NA 777 Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) via 778 intraperitoneal injection. After fully anesthetized, mice were mounted in a stereotaxic frame. A 779 midline incision was made to reveal Bregma, the skull was cleaned with hydrogen peroxide, and 780 small holes were drilled through the skull at the designated stereotaxic coordinates of NA57. 781 Bilateral guide cannula affixed with two 26G stainless-steel tubing (P1 Technologies Inc., 782 Roanoke, VA, USA) was stereotaxically implanted 0.5 mm above the NA region (0.7 mm caudal 783 to Bregma, 1.25 mm lateral to midline, 0.4 mm under the dura surface). Guide cannulas were 784 secured to the skull using super glue and dental cement. Matching dummy cannula were inserted 785 into the guide cannula and secured with a dust cap to ensure guide cannula patency. Post-786\noperative analgesia was provided with Buprenorphine SR (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection). 787 Mice recovered in their home cages for one week before challenge and drug delivery. 788 Starting from the baseline measurement of flexiVent assay, Prazosin (0.4 mg/ml in ultra-pure 789 water, P7791, Sigma), or Terazosin (0.4mg/ml in ultra-pure water, T4680, Sigma) or ultra-pure 790 water control was continuously microinjected (total volume 1 \u03bcl, continuously injecting for 17.5 791 minutes) into bilateral NA through the guided cannula using two-channel syringe pump (R462, 792 RWD, USA). For all the mice for NA microinjection, we kept the brainstem and confirmed 793 targeted cannula implantation in NA region through cryosection. 794 795 Statistical analysis 796 All statistics were calculated using Microsoft Excel and performed using GraphPad Prism 797 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA). Unpaired student\u2019s t-test, one-way or two-way ANOVA 798 Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test were used as indicated in figure legends to examine 799 significant differences across mice and experimental conditions. Values of p<0.05 were deem 800 significant and lack of significant differences (p>0.05) are indicated by N.S. (not significant). 801 802\nData and materials availability: The accession number for the raw and fully processed nTS 803 single-nucleus RNA sequencing data reported in this paper is GEO: GSE200003.
