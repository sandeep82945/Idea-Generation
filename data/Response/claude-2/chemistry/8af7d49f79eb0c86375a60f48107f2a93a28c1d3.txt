 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the impact of different classes of fly ash (Class C vs Class F) on CO2 adsorption capacity and kinetics. The chemical composition of fly ash varies depending on the coal source, so testing different classes could optimize adsorbent performance. 

2. Vary the particle size and morphology of the fly ash to determine the optimal properties for maximizing CO2 adsorption. Smaller particle sizes tend to increase surface area and porosity.

3. Test the stability and recyclability of the adsorbent through multiple adsorption-desorption cycles. This could identify any potential degradation issues over repeated use.

4. Explore the use of different amines or amine mixtures in the hydrogel to optimize CO2 affinity and capacity. The kinetics and capacity can vary based on the amine type.

5. Evaluate the selectivity of the adsorbent for CO2 capture from flue gas mixtures containing N2, O2, etc. to determine its viability for real-world applications. Testing with simulated flue gas is important.
