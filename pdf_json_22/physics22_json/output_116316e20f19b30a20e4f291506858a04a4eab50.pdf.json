To remove this\nby-product, H2O and CO2 have been employed in metal-catalyzed SWCNT growth systems because of their oxidizing ability. Recently, nonmetallic nanoparticles have\nbecome one of the growth seed candidates because of their high melting points and fewer\nmetal impurities. In this study, by using nanodiamond-derived carbon nanoparticles as\nthe solid growth seeds, we investigated the effect of CO2 and H2O on high-temperature SWCNT growth with two types of carbon-source supplies: C2H2 and C2H4. In this growth system, H2O showed oxidizing ability to etch a-C with either carbon sources. CO2 exhibited a similar a-C formation-preventing role in C2H4-supplied growth and achieved higher-purity SWCNTs with higher concentration of C2H4 than the case of H2O. However, in contrast to the other combinations, CO2 injection in the C2H2-supplied growth significantly enhanced the formation of a-C rather than the removal of it while the yield\nof SWCNTs was also increased, indicating the occurrence of the dehydration reaction\nbetween CO2 and C2H2. The present findings will lead to efficient growth of high-quality SWCNTs from nonmetallic growth seeds with the use of growth enhancers.\nKeywords: single-walled carbon nanotubes, chemical vapor deposition, crystallinity,\nnonmetallic nanoparticles, carbon dioxide\n3"

            "text": "Since their discovery in 1991, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [1] have been a subject of great\ninterest because of their exceptional properties, which present high potential in electronic\n[2], thermal [3], and mechanical applications [4]. Further, with the development of\nexperimental techniques, both single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) [5, 6] and multiwalled\nCNTs (MWCNTs) [7] have been obtained controllably. In particular, SWCNTs have\nreceived wide attention in the application of flexible electronic devices [8], chemical\nsensors [9], field-effect transistors (FETs) [10], and quantum light sources [11] owing to\ntheir superior properties such as high carrier mobility, structure-dependent electronic\nband structure, and high sensitivity to the surface environment [12]. Various methods\nhave been developed to obtain SWCNTs, e.g., arc discharge [13], laser ablation [14], and\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD) [15]. Nevertheless, limited by the uncontrollability of\nSWCNT structures in terms of crystallinity, chirality, length, etc., experimentally\nsynthesized SWCNTs tend to exhibit lower performances than expected [16-18]. The\ncrystallinity of SWCNTs is highly related to mechanical strength [19] as well as thermal\n[20] and electrical conductivity [21-23]; accordingly, it should be one of the most\nimportant characteristics to improve in the SWCNT growth process. The degradation of\ncrystallinity and subsequently the properties occurs through the formation of lattice\ndefects, including the pentagon\u2013heptagon pair (5\u20137) [24, 25], the pentagon\u2013heptagon\u2013\nheptagon\u2013pentagon (5\u20137\u20137\u20135) defects (often called as Stone-Wales defects) [26], ad-\ndimer [27, 28], and vacancy [29].\nTo achieve highly crystalline SWCNTs, a high temperature has been\nrecommended for the CVD process because it assists SWCNTs in overcoming the\nactivation energy of defect healing during growth [24, 30]. Along with the increase in\ngrowth temperature, the selection of growth seeds that possess high-temperature stability\nis a necessary factor for the synthesis of highly crystalline SWCNTs. Unfortunately,\ntraditional metal catalysts, such as iron [31, 32], nickel [33], cobalt [34], and related alloys\n[35], cannot avoid aggregation because of their low melting point [36, 37]. Moreover,\neven though they could be used as solid catalysts, e.g., W [38], Mo [38], Re [38], and TiC\n[39], metal nanoparticles are regarded as an impurity in some applications and must be\nremoved through post-treatment procedures, which causes damage to the as-grown\n4\nSWCNTs [40]. Nonmetallic nanoparticles, such as Si [41], SiC [41], Ge [41], and\nnanodiamond (ND) [42, 43], which possess desirable high melting points, have gradually\nattracted attention as alternative growth seeds of CNTs. Among these growth seeds, ND\n[42] possesses the notable advantage of avoiding the introduction of unnecessary\nelements owing to its composition, i.e., carbon.\nAnother important point to be considered in the CVD procedure is the deposition\nof amorphous carbon (a-C). As a byproduct formed during SWCNT growth, a-C is\nadsorbed on the surface of growth seeds and the nanotube sidewall. This results in\nblocking of the active sites of the seeds and shortening of growth lifetime, which\ndecreases the synthesis efficiency [44]. In a metal-catalyzed CNT growth system, to\nprevent the formation of a-C, some types of oxidants were employed as growth enhancers\nto etch away a-C. Water (H2O)-assisted CVD methods helped realize the growth of millimeter-long SWCNTs by maintaining the activity of the metal catalyst by selectively\nremoving the deposited a-C on its surface [45]. In addition, as the etchant, H2O exhibited its role in CNT growth kinetics [46, 47]. However, the strong oxidation activity of H2O limits the supply of the enhancer to the ppm level, while a low concentration results in\nloss of uniformity of the enhancer in a large-scale reactor [48]. Further, a high\nconcentration of H2O leads to the possibility of etching of both a-C and CNTs [49]. To date, carbon dioxide (CO2)\u2014another known growth enhancer with less oxidative activity\u2014has been employed with a higher concentration to induce oxidation reactions\n[50-58]. A mild etching effect is the advantage of CO2 in balancing a-C etching and the preservation of CNTs from damage during the mass production of CNTs.\nRecently, other enhancing roles of CO2 in metal-catalyzed CNT growth processes\nhave been found when using acetylene (C2H2) [53, 59] or methane (CH4) [60] as the carbon feedstock. One of its roles is to promote the dehydrogenation reaction of\nhydrocarbons, which are used as a carbon source in CNT growth. For synthesizing CNTs\nvia CVD, the carbon source is flown into the reactor and the deposition process proceeds\nwith pyrolysis reactions\u2014including the dehydrogenation reaction\u2014to form the\nintermediate products, which adsorb on the surface of catalysts or growth seeds and are\nused to construct the CNT structure. When a carbon source such as C2H2 was mixed with CO2 in an equimolar ratio, a dramatic increase in the CNT growth yield and initial growth\n5\nrate was observed [53]. To prove the occurrence of the CO2-promoted hydrocarbon dehydrogenation reaction, further evidence was provided through a theoretical calculation.\nWhen C2H2 was taken as the carbon source, with the injection of CO2, the calculated energy barrier of the dissociation of the first H atom from C2H2 decreased [59].\nDespite progress in the use of growth enhancers in metal-catalyzed growth,\nenhancer effects on SWCNT growth from nonmetallic seeds have been scarcely studied,\nmainly due to the originally low efficiency of SWCNT growth particularly at high\ntemperatures. We recently realized high-temperature SWCNT growth using ND-derived\nnanoparticles, which we hereafter call carbon nanoparticles (CNPs), as solid growth seeds\n[61]. The CNPs were prepared by transforming ND at high temperature, as will be\ndescribed in detail in Method section. To efficiently obtain highly crystalline SWCNTs\nfrom the CNPs, we developed a two-step growth process [61]. In this process, the\ncondition of the initial and secondary growth steps was separately adjusted to provide a\nsuitable growth-driving force for SWCNT cap formation [62] and stationary nanotube\nelongation, respectively. We also reported a preliminary result on the etching of a-C by\nH2O in a CNP-based growth system [61]. A more thorough study on growth enhancers, focusing on a combination with different carbon sources, will be beneficial for\nunderstanding the mechanism of SWCNT growth from the unconventional growth seeds\nand realizing the efficient growth of structure-controlled and high-quality SWCNTs.\nIn this research, to understand the effects of enhancers on SWCNT growth from\nthe CNPs, we systematically conducted SWCNT growth with the injection of CO2 and H2O in C2H2- and ethylene (C2H4)-supplied SWCNT growth processes at high temperatures. The effects of CO2 were first examined in a simple one-step growth process with the supply of C2H4 or C2H2 by changing the concentration and the supply delay of CO2. The comparison of the results with the previous results on H2O revealed the similarities and differences in the roles of the two growth enhancers including the\noxidation activity. Remarkably, CO2 in combination with C2H2 enhanced a-C deposition as well as SWCNT growth, which revealed the occurrence of the dehydration reaction.\nWe then applied CO2 and H2O into the two-step growth process where the efficient growth of high quality SWCNTs was realized [61]. In addition to the concentration\ndependence of the enhancers, the change in the quality and yield of SWCNTs along the\n6\ngrowth steps were investigated with different combinations of the growth enhancers and\nthe carbon sources. We discuss the mechanism of the growth enhancers based on the\nchange in chemical potential considering the dehydrogenation reaction between C2H2 and CO2 as well as the oxidation reaction."

            "text": "To transform ND particles into the CNPs which are suitable for the growth seeds,\npretreatment was conducted before the one-step and two-step SWCNT growth processes.\nThe pretreatment of the growth seeds and the synthesis of SWCNTs were performed in a\ntubular CVD furnace (GE-1000, GII Techno) where a quartz tube chamber was used to\n7\nload the substrates. The quartz tube chamber was designed to have a semicircular cross\nsection with a diameter of 43.6 mm and heating-zone length of 890 mm. The substrates\nwere placed at the center of the quartz tube chamber and treated with the surface-cleaning\nprocess in air for 10 min at 600 C (Figure 1 (b), process 1). During this process, the\ndiameter of ND was reduced to 2\u22123 nm, which is appropriate for SWCNT growth [61].\nIn the following annealing procedure, the heating temperature was gradually increased to\n1000 C and maintained for 1 h in Ar at 85 kPa with 20-sccm Ar injection. During this step, the surface of ND (sp3 carbon) changed into more stable graphitic shells (sp2 carbon),\ncalled carbon nano-onion structure [64, 65]. We used the CNPs possessing this structure\nas the growth seeds.\nAfter the annealing process, SWCNTs were synthesized with two types of\ncarbon feedstocks: C2H2 (2%)/Ar and C2H4 (2%)/Ar. Considering the difference in the thermal decomposition behaviors of C2H2 and C2H4 [66, 67], the synthesis condition was adjusted to fit the SWCNT growth from each carbon feedstock.\nWhen using C2H4 as the carbon feedstock, SWCNTs were synthesized at 1000\nC for 10 min with a mixture of 2-sccm C2H4/Ar and 18-sccm CO2/Ar while the total pressure was kept at 5 kPa, corresponding to a C2H4 partial pressure of 10 Pa. During the growth process, the partial pressure of CO2 was varied from 0 to 180 Pa by changing the flow rates of CO2 and Ar individually. When the partial pressure of CO2 was 0 Pa, the carrier gas was H2 (3%)/Ar instead of CO2/Ar, for the usual condition for the SWCNT growth without a growth enhancer. In addition, in C2H4-supplied growth, CO2 injection time was controlled. Figure 1 (a) shows that the start time (x min) for the injection of CO2 at 140 Pa was varied as 0 (added from the beginning of the growth), 2, 5, 7, and 10 min\n(no CO2 addition). Upon completion of the growth process, gas flows were switched to 20-sccm Ar and the temperature was decreased to room temperature while the total\npressure was maintained at ~57 Pa.\nWhen using C2H2 as the carbon feedstock, SWCNTs were synthesized at 900 C\nfor 10 min with a mixture of 1-sccm C2H2/Ar and 19-sccm CO2/Ar. Since C2H2 is highly active, the total pressure was kept at 500 Pa, corresponding to a C2H2 partial pressure of 0.5 Pa, which is lower than the case of C2H4. During the growth process, the partial\n8\npressure of CO2 contained in the 19-sccm CO2/Ar was varied from 0 (0%) to 0.25 Pa (0.05%) by changing the flow rates of CO2 and Ar individually. When the partial pressure of CO2 was 0 Pa, the carrier gas was 19-sccm H2 (3%)/Ar instead of 19-sccm CO2/Ar."

Therefore, we employed the\ntwo-step growth process in this study as well. As shown in Figure 1 (b), before the two-\nstep growth, the pretreatment of the growth seeds is needed (process 1 for heating in air\nand process 2 for annealing in Ar). Then, the two-step growth process starts, including\nthe initial growth step (process 3 for cap formation), the temperature-rising step (process\n4), and the secondary growth step (process 5 for the stationary elongation). After the 1-h\nannealing process at 1000 C (process 2 in Figure 1 (b)), C2H2 (2%)/Ar and C2H4 (2%)/Ar were used as the carbon feedstock, and the growth condition was adjusted for each growth\nstep and feedstock. H2O or CO2 was added as the growth enhancer after the initial growth stage (process 3 in Figure 1 (b)). Because the injection of H2O in C2H2-supplied growth has been studied in our previous work [61], the other three combinations of the feedstocks\nand enhancers were conducted in this study.\nIn the C2H2-supplied two-step growth process, the initial growth step was held\nat 850 C for 1 min with a mixture of 2-sccm C2H2/Ar and 18-sccm H2/Ar while the total pressure was maintained at 500 Pa, corresponding to a C2H2 partial pressure of 1 Pa.\nWhen the initial growth step was finished, the growth temperature was set to 1000 C and\nthe mass flow rate was adjusted to 1-sccm C2H2/Ar and 19-sccm CO2/Ar, where the partial pressure of C2H2 was 0.5 Pa. The partial pressure of CO2 added during the temperature-rising step (process 4 in Figure 1 (b)) was optimized to 0.05 Pa. Once the\ntemperature reached 1000 C, the secondary growth step began. The partial pressure of\nCO2 was varied from 0.1 to 0.5 Pa by individually controlling the flow rates of CO2 and Ar while the mass flow was maintained at 1-sccm C2H2/Ar and 19-sccm CO2/Ar. When choosing H2O as the growth enhancer, which has been studied in the previous work [61],\n9\nthe partial pressure of injected H2O during the temperature-rising step was optimized to\n0.15 Pa. Once the temperature reached 1000 C, the secondary growth step commenced.\nThe partial pressure of H2O was maintained at 0.15 Pa while the mass flow was maintained at 1-sccm C2H4/Ar and 19-sccm H2O/Ar. For comparison, the supply of 19- sccm CO2/Ar or H2O/Ar was replaced with that of 19-sccm H2 (3%)/Ar to realize SWCNT growth without growth enhancers.\nIn the C2H4-supplied two-step growth process, the initial growth step was held\nat 900 C for 1 min with a mixture of 4-sccm C2H4/Ar and 16-sccm H2/Ar while the total pressure was kept at 5 kPa, corresponding to a C2H4 partial pressure of 20 Pa. When the\ninitial growth step was finished, the growth temperature was set to 1000 C and the mass\nflow was adjusted to 1-sccm C2H4/Ar and 19-sccm CO2/Ar, where the partial pressure of C2H4 was 5 Pa. Similar to the aforementioned C2H2-supplied case, the growth enhancer (H2O or CO2) was injected when the initial growth step was finished. The partial pressure of CO2 added during the temperature-rising step was optimized to 2 Pa. Once the\ntemperature reached 1000 C, the secondary growth step commenced. The partial\npressure of CO2 was varied from 2 to 62.5 Pa while the mass flow was maintained at 1- sccm C2H4/Ar and 19-sccm CO2/Ar. When choosing H2O as the growth enhancer, the partial pressure of injected H2O during the temperature-rising step was optimized to 1 Pa.\nOnce the temperature reached 1000 C, the secondary growth step started. The partial\npressure of H2O was varied from 0 to 1.5 Pa while the mass flow was maintained at 1- sccm C2H4/Ar and 19-sccm H2O/Ar.

A\nRaman spectrometer (LabRAM HR800, HORIBA Jovin Yvon) was used with an\nexcitation wavelength \u03bbex of 633 nm. The laser spot size was approximately 0.9 \u03bcm, and the laser power was approximately 7 mW at the measurement point. The exposure time\n11\nof each measurement spot was 1 s for 5 cycles. Raman spectra of 30 randomly selected\nspots with SWCNT signal were collected from each sample, and the averaged spectra\nwere used for the analysis. The quality of formed SWCNTs was evaluated using the intensity ratio of the G-band (~1590 cm\u22121) to the D-band (1330\u20131360 cm\u22121), which was\nrepresented as IG/ID [68]. In most of the SWCNT growth situations, the density of SWCNTs was low in the high-temperature synthesis case and the G-band was\noccasionally not observed. Thus, the growth yield of SWCNTs was evaluated through the\nG-band observation frequency (GOF), that is, the number of appearances of the G-band\nin the measured spectra divided by the total number of measurements. Notably, in some\ngrowth cases, the density of SWCNTs was high and the GOF was approximately 100%,\nso that the difference of the growth yield could not be reflected by the changes in the\nGOF. In such a situation, the SWCNT quantity was evaluated by comparing the intensity ratio of the G-band (~1590 cm\u22121) with the Raman peak from Si substrates (~520 cm\u22121),\nwhich was represented as IG/ISi. Typically, Raman spectra of 100 randomly selected spots (with or without SWCNT signal) were collected for the evaluation of the GOF.

            "text": "To investigate the effect of growth enhancers on SWCNT growth without metal catalysts,\nCO2 was injected in the high-temperature synthesis process with the CNPs as the growth seeds and different carbon feedstocks, namely, C2H2 and C2H4. Figure 2 depicts the variation of SWCNT yield and quality for various concentrations of CO2 input into the C2H4-supplied growth processes.\nBy injecting CO2 from the beginning of the growth, the SWCNTs were\nsynthesized from C2H4 at 10 Pa and 1000 \u00b0C for 10 min. The Raman spectra shown in\n12\nFigure 2(a), which are normalized to the Si peak intensity at ~520 cm\u22121, show the\nvariation of the D-band and G-band with the injection of CO2 at different partial pressures (0\u2013180 Pa). The quality (IG/ID ratio) and quantity (GOF) of SWCNTs are shown in Figure 2 (b). In addition, the ID/ISi ratio of the SWCNT and blank samples shown in Figure 2 (b) helps to distinguish the origin of the D-band: a-C deposited on samples or defects in\nSWCNT lattices. In the blank samples, since no SWCNTs are grown, the ID/ISi ratio reflects only the degree of a-C formation under the growth condition. If a-C is deposited\non a blank sample, a similar or higher density of a-C should be deposited on an SWCNT\nsample under the same condition due to the curvature of nanotubes and the increased\nsurface area of the sample. If a-C is not deposited on a blank sample, a-C deposition on\nan SWCNT sample should be very low or negligible under the same condition. Upon the\naddition of CO2, the grown SWCNTs exhibit a decrease in D-band intensity and a slight change in G-band intensity (Figure 2 (a)). An improvement in the SWCNT quality is\napparently revealed by the increase in the IG/ID ratio (Figure 2(b)). The decreasing tendency observed in the ID/ISi ratio from the blank samples represents the decrease in aC. A similar tendency is exhibited by the ID/ISi ratio from the SWCNT samples, and finally the ID/ISi ratio is close to that of the blank samples. These results prove that the origin of the D-band from the SWCNTs should be mostly from a-C, and with the injection of CO2, a-C deposition is gradually prevented. The averaged IG/ID ratio reached approximately 100 when the partial pressure of CO2 was adjusted to 160 Pa. With further increase in the partial pressure of CO2 to an excess value, 180 Pa, the ID/ISi ratio did not increase in the blank samples but did slightly increase in the SWCNT samples. Thus, the increase in the\nID/ISi ratio in the SWCNT samples reflects the formation of defects. Meanwhile, the yield of SWCNTs shown as the GOF in Figure 2 (b) exhibited a small reduction with the\ninjection of CO2, until an excess amount of CO2 (180 Pa) was added. The variation in the growth yield indicates that the injection of CO2 also influences the growth efficiency of SWCNTs. This growth result indicates the potential of CO2 in preventing the deposition of a-C at high temperatures. Additionally, the slight formation of defects even with excess\nCO2 confirms the mild etching ability of CO2. It should be noted that, besides Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is another promising method to\nanalyze the structure of SWCNTs and a-C. However, it is still challenging to prepare\n13\nSWCNT samples on TEM grids because of the relatively low yield of SWCNTs in this\nstudy.\nNext, the etching effect of CO2 on SWCNT growth was analyzed by delaying\nthe injection time of CO2 to 2, 5, and 7 min while the partial pressure was maintained at 140 Pa. With the delaying of the injection time, the D-band intensity gradually increased,\nas shown in Figure 2 (c). A decrease in the IG/ID ratio can be seen in Figure 2 (d), which reflects the reduction in the SWCNT quality. Moreover, the increase in the ID/ISi ratio of both SWCNTs and the corresponding blank samples, as seen in Figure 2 (d), proves that\nthe amount of a-C deposited on the SWCNT samples gradually increases. Even with an\nincrease in the partial pressure of CO2 to 200 Pa, when delaying the injection time to 5 min, the increase in a-C deposition cannot be prevented perfectly (shown in Figure S1).\nThe milder a-C-etching ability of CO2 has been discussed in previous studies on metalcatalyzed growth systems [51-57, 59, 60]. Moreover, without a metal catalyst, the\nincrease in the D-band intensity along with the delaying of the injection time reflects that\nthe a-C etching rate of CO2 is limited to be of the same order as the deposition rate of aC or even slower. Notably, the GOF in Figure 2 (d) shows a slightly decreased yield when\nCO2 is added from the beginning or after 2 min of growth. Because the initial cap formation is expected to occur in the first few minutes during the synthesis, such a slight\ndecrease in yield implies that CO2 reduces the growth yield of SWCNTs by influencing the initial growth efficiency. Associating the decrease in the growth yield with the a-C-\netching ability, we assume that during SWCNT growth from the CNP growth seeds, CO2 reduces the density of carbon species adsorbed on the surface of growth seeds via an\noxidation reaction. Such a decrease in the density of activated carbon species adsorbed\non the growth seeds reduced the carbon supply rate to the growth edge, which explains\nboth the reduction in the growth yield and the deposition of a-C. Thus, in this CO2participated SWCNT growth process, the limited deposition of a-C is due to the reduction\nof the activated carbon species instead of the etching of a-C. Unavoidably, such a decrease\nin carbon supply also slightly influences the SWCNT growth efficiency, particularly in\nthe nucleation stage, which is more sensitive to the growth condition than is the stationary\nelongation stage.\n14"

A relatively minor improvement in SWCNT quality can be observed in the\nIG/ID shown in Figure 3 (b), which is mainly caused by the suspension of a-C deposition.\nCompared with less active C2H4, the use of highly active C2H2 as the carbon\nsource at high growth temperatures resulted in a higher growth yield. The GOF of most\nsamples reached 100% except for the sample with the highest CO2 pressure under this experiment condition, as shown in Figure 3 (a). Thus, IG/ISi was used to evaluate the yield in this case, which is shown in Figure 3 (b). In contrast to the case of C2H4, the increased yield was achieved with C2H2 when the partial pressure of CO2 was set to 0.05 and 0.15 Pa. Because a similar IG/ID ratio was obtained with and without the assistance of CO2, the increase in growth yield due to CO2 is unlikely to be caused by the prevention of a-C deposition, which could prolong the lifetime of the growth seeds. Thus, we need to\nconsider a possible role of CO2 other than the etching of a-C.\nIn C2H2-supplied CNT growth, besides etching ability, CO2 has been recently\nproven to exhibit a promoting role in the dehydrogenation reaction of hydrocarbon, which\nfinally increases CNT yield [53]. In the CO2-enhanced CNT growth process, two chemical reactions are possible between C2H2 and CO2:\nC2H2+CO2 \u2194 2C+H2O+CO, (1)\nC2H2+CO2 \u2194 C+H2+2CO. (2)\nBased on these reactions, a reduced activation energy barrier (from 5.58 down to 4.97 eV)\nof the first H dissociation in the C2H2 dehydrogenation process with the injection of CO2 was illustrated through a simulation method [59]. Similar to these studies, we assume that\nthe dehydrogenation reactions between C2H2 and CO2 also occur in the SWCNT growth process from the nonmetallic growth seeds. Based on the enhanced dehydrogenation\nreaction, the formation of activated carbon species on the growth seeds was promoted and\n16\ncaused a higher carbon-source supply, which resulted in an increase in both SWCNT\ngrowth yield and a-C deposition."

            "text": "Based on the enhancing effect of CO2 in one-step SWCNT synthesis from the CNP growth seeds, we applied CO2 to the two-step growth process, which was proven to increase the yield of highly crystalline SWCNTs [61]. In the two-step growth system\nshown in Figure 4 (a), the C2H4-supplied growth SWCNTs using H2O as an enhancer were also conducted for comparison.\nFigures 4 (b) and (c) present the quality and quantity variation of SWCNTs from\nthe C2H4-supplied two-step growth process when using different growth enhancers, namely, H2O and CO2. Regarding the injection time of the growth enhancers, we previously found that additional defects were formed if H2O was injected from the initial growth step [61]. Even when using CO2 as the growth enhancer, the supply of CO2 from the initial growth step resulted in a slight decrease in SWCNT yield in the one-step growth\nfrom C2H4 (Figure 2 (c) and (d)). Thus, to maintain the nucleation efficiency during the\n17\ninitial growth step (process 1 in Figure 4 (a)), both enhancers were added at the beginning\nof the temperature-rising step (process 2 in Figure 4 (a)). The partial pressure of the\ngrowth enhancers during the temperature-rising step was optimized (1 Pa for H2O or 2 Pa for CO2) to prevent the deposition of a-C (Figure S3). The influence of enhancers was analyzed according to the changes in the yield and quality of SWCNTs when varying the\npartial pressure of H2O and CO2 at the secondary growth step (process 3 in Figure 4 (a)). The condition is represented by the partial pressure of enhancers during the three\nprocesses; for example, 0-1-1 Pa means that the partial pressure during the initial growth\nstep, temperature-rising step, and secondary growth step is 0, 1, and 1 Pa, respectively.\n18\npartial pressures during the temperature-rising step were fixed to 1 and 2 Pa for H2O and CO2, respectively. Standard deviation was also calculated and presented as the error bar of averaged IG/ID. (d) Raman spectra and (e, f, g) SEM images (acceleration voltage: 5 kV) of SWCNTs synthesized (e) without a growth enhancer, (f) with the injection of H2O (0-1-1 Pa), and (g) with the injection of CO2 (0-2-55 Pa).\nIn Figure 4 (b), with increasing H2O partial pressure at the secondary growth\nstep from 0 to 1.5 Pa (0-1-0, 0-1-1, 0-1-1.25, and 0-1-1.5 Pa), the averaged IG/ID ratios exhibit a decreasing tendency, which indicates an increase in a-C or defect formation\ncaused by excess H2O. To elucidate the origin of the D-band, we compared the averaged ID/ISi ratios of the SWCNT samples and the corresponding blank samples. For the growth process in which no H2O or only 1-Pa H2O (0-1-0 Pa and 0-1-1 Pa) was supplied during the secondary growth step, slightly higher or similar ID/ISi ratios were observed for the SWCNT samples compared with the blank samples. The appearance of the D-band in the\nblank samples originated from the deposition of a-C. Thus, below 1 Pa of H2O, the appearance of the D-band from SWCNT samples is explained by the deposition of a-C.\nWhen the partial pressure of H2O was increased to 1.5 Pa at the secondary growth step (0-1-1.5 Pa), ID/ISi decreased in the blank samples, which indicates the removal of a-C. However, a dramatic increase in ID/ISi was found in the SWCNTs samples. Such a Dband of the SWCNTs samples should originate from the formation of defects. Therefore,\nwe assume that when the partial pressure of H2O was greater than 1 Pa in this growth system, in addition to a-C, SWCNT structures were partially etched by H2O, resulting in defect formation. In addition, when the partial pressure of H2O was increased to 1.25 Pa, the GOF decreased to ~40%. The GOF further decreased to 0% when the partial pressure\nof H2O increased to 1.5 Pa. The increase in D-band intensity represents the formation of the sp3 structure (defects), and the disappearance of the G-band represents the loss of\nSWCNTs. This dramatic decrease in SWCNT yield also reflects one of the disadvantages\nof H2O, which comes from its strong oxidizing ability at high temperatures. Because of this strong oxidizing ability, the oxidizing reaction occurred not only in a-C but also in\nSWCNTs and activated carbon species, particularly with excess H2O, which caused a decrease in the SWCNT quality and quantity. The abovementioned growth results\nindicate that the complete removal of a-C is difficult by adding H2O without causing\n19\ndamage to SWCNTs and the partial pressure of H2O needs to be accurately controlled to avoid the destruction of SWCNTs.\nMoreover, using C2H4 as the carbon source, a CO2-assisted two-step growth was\nconducted; the corresponding results are summarized in Figure 4 (c). Because of its\nmilder oxidizing ability, CO2 with a partial pressure greater than that of H2O was used for the secondary growth step. With the same growth condition (carbon-source partial\npressure, growth time, and growth temperature) as that using H2O, CO2 exhibits a higher effectivity in improving the quality of SWCNTs according to the increase in the averaged\nIG/ID ratios shown in Figure 4 (c). Additionally, with an increase in the CO2 partial pressure from 2 to 62.5 Pa (0-2-2, 0-2-7.5, 0-2-25, c, 0-2-55, and 0-2-62.5 Pa), a\ndecreasing tendency of the averaged ID/ISi ratio was found in both the SWCNT samples and the blank samples. Such an increase in the IG/ID ratio to ~69 and a decrease of ID/ISi ratio close to 0 indicates the formation of highly crystalline SWCNTs with negligible\ndeposition of a-C. The lower deposition of a-C helps to keep the surface of the growth\nseeds clean and prolongs the growth lifetime, which explains the slight increase in the\ngrowth yield. Figure 4 (d) depicts the Raman spectra of the SWCNTs grown under\noptimized growth conditions without growth enhancers, with H2O (0-1-1 Pa), and with CO2 (0-2-55 Pa). Because the G-band intensity in the Raman spectra is normalized, the difference in the D-band intensity can be clearly observed. Compared with the growth\nwithout growth enhancers or with H2O, CO2 presents its advantage in preventing a-C deposition when using C2H4 as the carbon source. Figures 4 (e), (f), and (g) show the SEM images of the SWCNTs grown without growth enhancers, with H2O, and with CO2, respectively. The particles shown in the SEM images are agglomerates of the CNPs. In\nFigure 4 (e), without growth enhancers, SWCNTs with a significantly shorter length (~50\nnm) appeared owing to the deposition of a-C, which terminated the growth in a short time.\nWhen H2O is added to the growth process, the decrease in the short SWCNTs shown in Figure 4 (f) represents the suppression of a-C deposition, which prolongs the lifetime of\nthe growth seeds. When using CO2 as the growth enhancer, the formation of a-C was prevented more effectively; longer SWCNTs can be frequently found in Figure 4 (g).\nWe then investigated the changes in growth yield and quality along the process\nflow of the two-step growth with and without the growth enhancers (0-1-1 Pa of H2O or\n20\n0-2-55 Pa of CO2). Raman spectra were acquired from the samples immediately after the three steps: the initial growth step, temperature-rising step, and secondary growth step.\nThe changes in GOF and IG/ID are shown in Figure 5. Even without growth enhancers, the slight increase in the IG/ID ratios from the initial growth step to the temperature-rising step proves that the deposition of a-C is still low before the growth temperature rises to\n1000 \u00b0C. The addition of H2O or CO2 with the optimized conditions during the temperature-rising step causes an increase in the IG/ID ratios compared with that without growth enhancers. This means that the deposition of a-C is further prevented by H2O or CO2. However, according to Figure 5 (a), compared to the sample without growth enhancers, the decreased yield of SWCNTs was observed when H2O or CO2 was added. Particularly for CO2, there was almost no increase in yield during the temperature-rising step. Based on the role of CO2 at high temperatures described in section 3.1 (one-step growth), we assume that the prevention of a-C formation is mainly caused by the decrease\nin carbon species adsorbed on the growth seeds. Such a decrease also caused the decrease\nin SWCNT yield.\nAfter the temperature-rising step, the secondary growth step was conducted, in\nwhich the stationary growth of SWCNTs occurs. Notably, with the temperature rising\nfrom 900 \u00b0C to 1000 \u00b0C, the carbon-source decomposition rate increases, which causes\nan increase in the supply of activated carbon species [66]. Without the injection of growth\nenhancers, the deposition of a-C was enhanced, as shown in Figure 5 (b). The use of H2O could not provide SWCNTs with high crystallinity and low a-C simultaneously. The a-C\ndeposition caused the decrease in the IG/ID ratio and finally terminated the growth at the beginning of the secondary growth step, which is evidenced by the negligible increase in\nthe GOF from the temperature-rising step to the secondary growth step in Figure 5 (a).\nBy contrast, in the case of CO2 addition, the partial pressure of CO2 could be largely increased along with the increase in the supplied carbon source without damaging the\nSWCNTs because of its mild oxidizing ability. The increase in the GOF from the\ntemperature-rising step to the secondary growth step indicates the enhancement effect of\nCO2. Based on such enhancement results, CO2 was further applied to the two-step growth with the supply of higher-partial-pressure C2H4 at the secondary growth step. Through the adjustment of the growth temperature at the secondary growth step, the IG/ISi ratio was\n21\nincreased to ~0.15 while the GOF was 100%, and the IG/ID ratio was kept at ~57 (Figure S4). We assume that CO2 prolongs the lifetime of the growth seeds by keeping their surface clean and maintains the efficient growth of SWCNTs during the secondary growth\nstep."

            "heading": "3.4. Effects of enhancers on C2H2-supplied two-step growth",
            "text": "We investigated the effect of CO2 on the C2H2-supplied two-step growth process. The growth process is schematically shown in Figure 6 (a). Similar to the condition in the\nC2H4-supplied growth described in section 3.3, CO2 was injected after the first growth step and its partial pressure during the temperature-rising step was optimized to 0.05 Pa.\nBecause the growth result with the injection of H2O has already been discussed in our previous work [61], the growth results with CO2 injection are mainly discussed in this section.\nFigure 6 (b) depicts the variation of the quality (IG/ID and ID/ISi ratios) and yield\n(GOF) of SWCNTs with a change in the partial pressure of CO2 at the secondary growth step from 0.1 to 0.5 Pa (0-0.05-0.1, 0-0.05-0.25, 0-0.05-0.35, and 0-0.05-0.5 Pa). The\nrelevant Raman spectra are shown in Figure S5. Interestingly, contrary to the expected\nrole of CO2 for a-C deposition prevention, relatively low IG/ID ratio were observed. Within\n22\nthe range of CO2 partial pressure, the growth yield decreased with increasing CO2. This indicates that the injection of CO2 cannot prevent the deposition of a-C in the C2H2supplied growth process. Even after the partial pressure of CO2 was increased to 0.5 Pa (0-0.05-0.5 Pa), the yield decreased while the IG/ID ratio did not change significantly, which means that the intensities of both the G-band and D-band decreased. However, as\nshown in Figure 6 (c), the D-band and G-band intensities of the sample with 0.1-Pa CO2 (0-0.05-0.1 Pa) are higher than those of the sample without growth enhancers. Because\nthe GOF of both samples is already 100% under this condition, the intensity of the G-\nband reflects the SWCNT yield. Moreover, according to the SEM images shown in\nFigures 6 (d) and (e), a higher density of SWCNTs was observed in the CO2-injected sample than in the sample without growth enhancers. To analyze the increase of D-band\nintensity, we compared the change in a-C deposition on the blank samples along the two-\nstep growth process with and without the injection of CO2. As shown in Figure S6, higher ID/ISi ratio was found in the CO2-injected case. The increase of ID/ISi should be attributed to the a-C deposition since there is no possibility of defect formation on the blank samples,\nwhere no SWCNTs were grown. Thus, for the sample grown with a small amount of CO2, the higher G-band intensity represents a higher yield and the higher D-band intensity\ncould reflect the more intense deposition of a-C. Moreover, the appearance of the radial breathing mode peak at ~180 cm\u22121, which was not observed in the samples grown without\na growth enhancer, indicates that thinner SWCNTs were formed with the injection of CO2. The formation of the thinner SWCNTs should be due to the increased growth-driving\nforce [30]. Considering that the growth temperature and partial pressure of C2H2 were fixed, the increased density of activated carbon species is regarded as the main factor that\ncauses the increase in the growth-driving force. The activated carbon species are formed\nfrom the decomposition of C2H2. As discussed in section 3.2, we assume that CO2 in C2H2-supplied growth mainly works as a growth enhancer, which promotes the dehydrogenation reaction of the carbon source and increases the density of activated\ncarbon species. Such an increase in activated carbon species promotes SWCNT growth\nbut also leads to uncontrolled a-C deposition.\n23\n24\nThe changes in the quality and yield of SWCNTs along the growth steps with\nand without the injection of enhancers are shown in Figure 7. The result with H2O (0- 0.15-0.15 Pa) has been taken from our previous work [61]. Raman measurement was\nconducted after the initial growth, temperature-rising, and secondary growth steps as in\nthe case of C2H4. Because of the higher activity of C2H2 than C2H4, a-C was easily formed during the temperature-rising and secondary growth steps, which caused the decrease in\nthe IG/ID ratios when no growth enhancer was injected. As reported in our previous work [61], with accurate control of the H2O partial pressure (0-0.15-0.15 Pa), a-C was effectively removed and the IG/ID ratio increased. At the same time, a part of the activated carbon species was also removed from the growth seed surface by H2O, which resulted in the decrease in the SWCNT yield compared with the sample without growth enhancers,\nas shown in Figure 7 (a). When using CO2 as the growth enhancer, contrasting results were obtained. The IG/ID ratio decreased while the GOF was increased by CO2. The dramatic increase in the GOF also supports our assumption that the carbon-source supply\nis promoted by the injection of CO2. This promotion effect causes the increase in SWCNT yield as well as the deposition of a-C. Thus, based on the discussion above, we conclude\nthat CO2 plays more than one role in SWCNT growth from the CNP growth seeds depending on the employed carbon feedstocks.\n25"

            "heading": "3.5. Mechanism of growth enhancers in combination with carbon sources",
            "text": "The mechanism of the effect of enhancers (H2O and CO2) on SWCNT growth\nbehavior is derived from the observed results and is schematically depicted in Figure 8.\nIn the SWCNT growth system based on the CNP growth seeds, carbon-source molecules\nin the gas phase first overcome the energy barrier to proceed with the dehydrogenation\nreaction, and activated carbon species are adsorbed on the surface of growth seeds. Then,\nthe activated carbon species are attached to the edge of the SWCNT sidewall. Therefore,\nthe conversion process of carbon-source molecules to SWCNTs is divided into two parts:\nthe process in which the carbon-source molecules in the gas phase are transformed into\nactivated carbon species of the adsorbed phase and the subsequent process in which the\nactivated carbon species are transformed into the SWCNT structure. The activation\nenergies (EA) for these two processes are denoted as EA1 and EA2, respectively.\nWe first discuss the effect of H2O. In SWCNT growth from both C2H2 and C2H4\nusing the CNP growth seeds, H2O was found to mainly prevent the formation of a-C. We assume that the preventing role is realized through the oxidizing reaction, which is similar\nto its role in SWCNT growth from a metallic catalyst. With the addition of H2O, the chemical potential of activated carbon species decreased, which caused the decrease of\nSWCNT growth efficiency, as shown in Figures 8 (a) and (b). In addition to a-C, a part\nof the activated carbon species on the surface of growth seeds is etched away by H2O, which decreases the density of the carbon species and accordingly their chemical potential.\nThe decrease in the chemical potential increases the activation energy needed for the\nformation of SWCNTs (EA2\u2019 in Figures 8 (a) and (b)), assuming that the transition state is preserved by the addition of H2O. This change reasonably explains the decrease in the SWCNT growth efficiency in both the C2H2- and C2H4-supplied system by H2O.\nWhen using CO2 as the growth enhancer, the reaction between the carbon source\nand CO2 needs to be considered depending on the carbon source. In the case of C2H4, as the reaction with CO2 is not significant, the main role of CO2 is etching. With the injection of CO2, the chemical potential of activated carbon species decreased, which caused the decrease of SWCNT growth efficiency, as shown in Figures 8 (a). Because the oxidizing\nability of CO2 is lower than that of H2O, CO2 mainly etches away activated carbon species\n26\non the growth seeds and does not directly react with the formed a-C. The decrease in the\ndensity of the carbon species causes a decrease in chemical potential and increase in\nactivation energy, resulting in the low growth efficiency of SWCNTs. In the case of C2H2, a dehydrogenation reaction occurs between CO2 and C2H2. As shown in Figure 8(b), the activation energy of the dehydrogenation reaction of C2H2 decreases from EA1 (the process without CO2) to EA1\u2019 (the process with CO2). Such a decrease in the energy barrier helps to increase the rate of carbon feedstock transformation from the gas phase to the\nadsorbed phase. The increased adsorbed carbon specie density causes the increase in\nchemical potential of carbon and then the decrease in the activation energy for SWCNT\nformation (EA2\u201d). This growth condition further promotes the formation of both SWCNTs and a-C. Therefore, the reaction between C2H2 and CO2 significantly affects the enhancement of SWCNT growth not only in the metal-catalyzed SWCNT growth but also\nin the solid carbon seed-based growth.\n27\nenhancers. Chemical potential variation of carbon in the gas phase, activated carbon species adsorbed on the growth seed, and carbon in an SWCNT is shown. The black, blue, and orange curves denote the chemical potential under the growth conditions without growth enhancers, with H2O, and with CO2, respectively."

            "text": "In conclusion, by employing ND-derived CNPs as the growth seeds, we investigated the\ndifferent roles of growth enhancers (CO2 and H2O) in high-temperature SWCNT growth processes using different carbon feedstocks (C2H2 and C2H4). By comparing two commonly used hydrocarbons, we found that the enhancement role of CO2 differed depending on the carbon source, while similar etching role of H2O exhibited in both hydrocarbon-supplied growth. In the C2H4-supplied growth, controlling the partial pressure and injection time of CO2 prevents the formation of a-C without causing the formation of defects and achieves highly crystalline SWCNTs with high purity. However,\nCO2 exhibits the enhancement effect in both SWCNT growth and deposition of a-C when using C2H2 as the carbon source. Moreover, in the two-step growth process, the injection of CO2 results in a prevention effect of a-C deposition in the C2H4-supplied case and the enhancing effect of SWCNT yield and a-C deposition in the C2H2 case. Particularly in the C2H4-supplied two-step SWCNT growth process, with the use of CO2, highly crystalline SWCNTs with less a-C deposition were achieved when the temperature of the\nsecondary growth step was 1000 \u00b0C. Furthermore, by tuning the growth condition, the\nSWCNT yield was highly increased as indicated by the GOF of 100% and the IG/ISi ratio of ~0.15, while the quality of SWCNTs was preserved. Our results demonstrate the\ndifferent synergetic effects of growth enhancers and carbon sources in high-temperature\nSWCNT synthesis based on the solid carbon growth seeds, proving that CO2 can be used as an effective growth enhancer in the C2H4-supplied two-step growth process to achieve high-quality SWCNTs with a high yield.\n28\nAssociated Content\nAuthor Information\nCorresponding Author\nYoshihiro Kobayashi \u2212 Department of Applied Physics, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871,\nJapan; Email: kobayashi@ap.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp; Tel: +81 06 6879 7833; Fax: +81 06 6879 7863\nMengyue Wang \u2212 Department of Applied Physics, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871,\nJapan;\nAuthors\nYuanjia Liu \u2212 Department of Applied Physics, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan;\nManaka Maekawa \u2212 Department of Applied Physics, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871,\nJapan;\nMichiharu Arifuku \u2212 Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., 31-12, Shimo 3-chome, Kita-ku, Tokyo 115-8588,\nJapan;\nNoriko Kiyoyanagi \u2212 Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., 31-12, Shimo 3-chome, Kita-ku, Tokyo 115-8588,\nJapan;\nTaiki Inoue \u2212 Department of Applied Physics, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan;\nNotes\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest."
