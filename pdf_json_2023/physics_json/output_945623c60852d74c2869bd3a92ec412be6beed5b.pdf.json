Pyocyanin is also a redox molecule and we\u00a0 hypothesize that ascorbic acid being an antioxidant will interact with pyocyanin. The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential interaction of ascorbic acid with pyocyanin, and also to investigate the impact of ascorbic acid in combination with Furanone-30 on quorum sensing and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. When incubated with ascorbic acid, hyperchromic and hypsochromic shifts in pyocyanin absorbance peaks at 385 nm and 695 nm were observed. In the presence of dehydroascorbic acid and citric acid, these shifts were absent, indicating that the intrinsic antioxidant property of ascorbic acid was probably essential in binding to pyocyanin. NMR spectroscopy showed shifts in 1H NMR pyocyanin peaks between 8.2 to 5.8 ppm when incubated in the presence of ascorbic acid. Density Functional Theory (DFT) supported potential interactions between the \u2013CH2OH or \u2013OH moieties of ascorbic acid with the \u2013C=O moiety of pyocyanin. The pyocyanin-ascorbic acid complex impaired pyocyanin binding to DNA. Ascorbic acid combined with furanone-30 elevated quorum-sensing inhibition in P. aeruginosa, which was directly associated with significantly reduced P. aeruginosa virulence, adhesion, aggregation and biofilm formation and enhanced antibiotic-mediated bacterial killing. This study demonstrated that the antioxidant ascorbic acid directly binds to pyocyanin, modulates its structure and results in disruption of biofilm formation and associated tolerance to antibiotics.\nKEYWORDS\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, biofilm, ascorbic acid, antibiotic resistance, pyocyanin"

            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium that can cause life-threatening infections in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has placed P. aeruginosa in its critical group category due to its infection-causing capability and ability to become multi-antibiotic resistant (WHO, 2017). P. aeruginosa is a major pathogen in patients who are immunocompromised including in the early and late stage of HIV infected patients including AIDS patients (Meynard et\u00a0al., 1999). It is also a major pathogen in cystic fibrosis, bronchitis, burns and surgery-associated wounds patients (Tredget et\u00a0al., 2004; Ranjan et\u00a0al., 2010; Fern\u00e1ndez-Barat et\u00a0al., 2021).\nIt is also a common pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired infections, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and contact-lens-associated keratitis (infection of the cornea), as well as contaminating water and food (Bassetti et\u00a0al., 2013; CDC, 2023).\nOne of the major virulence mechanisms of P. aeruginosa is its ability to form biofilms. Biofilms consist of cells embedded in an organic matrix, in the case of P. aeruginosa, extracellular DNA (eDNA), polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids, are prominent matrix components that facilitate biofilm formation and its structural integrity (Dogsa et\u00a0 al., 2005; Ryder et\u00a0 al., 2007; Flemming and Wingender, 2010; Das et\u00a0al., 2015). P. aeruginosa also secretes various virulence factors such as pyocyanin, hemolysins, elastase, alginate, rhamnolipids, hydrogen cyanide and cyclic dipeptides (Terada et\u00a0al., 1999; Sato and Frank, 2004; Zulianello et\u00a0al., 2006; Fothergill et\u00a0al., 2007; Smith et\u00a0al., 2013; McCaslin et\u00a0al., 2015; Chadha et\u00a0al., 2021; Das, 2021; Kapadia et\u00a0al., 2022). P. aeruginosa also produces ferric (Fe3+) iron binding molecules called siderophores (such as pyoverdine) when iron has bioavailability. Bacterial siderophores chelate/scavenge insoluble Fe3+ from the environment and solubilize it (via reduction) to ferrous (Fe2+) iron (Wilson, et\u00a0al., 2016). Pyoverdine-dependent iron transport affects signalling systems in bacteria which are crucial for biofilm development and also essential for their fitness and growth. P. aeruginosa mutants deficient in siderophore production form weak biofilms (Banin et\u00a0al., 2005; Visca et\u00a0al., 2007).\nRegulation of biofilm formation and virulence factor production can be\u00a0mediated by a complex cell-to-cell communication system called quorum sensing (QS) (Lee and Zhang, 2015; Fazeli-Nasab et\u00a0al., 2022). QS involves the synthesis of cellular signalling/autoinducer molecules such as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) and the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). These molecules bind to receptor molecules that regulate gene transcription (Lee and Zhang, 2015). The PQS system upregulates phenazine-producing operons (genes) phzA1-G1 and phzA2-G2, which produce phenazine-1carboxylic acid. Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid is converted into pyocyanin by the action of the products of phzM and phzS (Mavrodi et\u00a0al., 2001; Lee and Zhang, 2015; Das, 2021).\nPyocyanin (1-hydroxy-5-methyl-phenazine) is an electrochemically (redox) active metabolite and zwitter ion that triggers the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that, in turn, induce oxidative stress and deplete intracellular antioxidant (glutathione) levels in host cells (O\u2019Malley et\u00a0al., 2004). Pyocyanin production and oxidative stress can increase the production of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-8, inhibit fibroblast growth and trigger premature cell cycle arrest (senescence) (Denning et\u00a0al., 1998; O\u2019Malley et\u00a0al., 2004; Muller et\u00a0al., 2009; Gonzalez et\u00a0al.,\n2016). The overproduction of pyocyanin by P. aeruginosa is associated with hyper-virulent strains that produce more severe infections (Fothergill et\u00a0al., 2007). Pyocyanin is not only a virulence factor but is a crucial factor involved in biofilm formation and biofilm stability (Das et\u00a0 al., 2015). Pyocyanin promotes eDNA release from P. aeruginosa, and can bind to DNA and promote electron transfer in P. aeruginosa biofilms (Das and Manefield, 2012; Das et\u00a0al., 2015; Saunders et\u00a0al., 2020).\nAscorbic acid is a water-soluble antioxidant that scavenges ROS and terminates peroxidative processes (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999; Pehlivan, 2017). However, ascorbic acid can also be\u00a0 a pro-oxidant in the presence of metals such as iron and copper triggered by Fenton\u2019s reaction (Buettner, 1993; Bucher and White, 2016). Ascorbic acid has been used to treat bacterial infections such as Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis and peptic ulcers (Mei and Tu, 2018). Ascorbic acid can inhibit the QS mechanism in P. aeruginosa and Vibrio campbellii, reducing virulence factor production (El-Mofawy et\u00a0al., 2014; Han et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThis study investigated the impact of ascorbic acid directly on pyocyanin and QS in P. aeruginosa. A novel discovery is that ascorbic acid interacts directly with pyocyanin and modulates its structure. The complex formation between pyocyanin and ascorbic inhibits pyocyanin binding to DNA. Furthermore, combining ascorbic acid with the QS inhibitor furanone-30 potentiates QS inhibition and results in biofilm disruption and an enhancement of antibioticmediated bacterial killing."

Pyocyanin was also mixed with dehydroascorbic acid (pH 7) in ratios of 1:10, 1:20 and 1:100.\nTo investigate the change in pyocyanin absorbance peaks in the presence of ascorbic acid, citric acid (at both acidic and pH 7) or dehydroascorbic acid, 200 \u03bcL of pyocyanin-ascorbic acid mixtures (ratios 1:0, 1:1, 1:5; 1:10 and 1:20), pyocyanin-citric acid mixture (1:20) and pyocyanin-dehydroascorbic acid mixture (1:10, 1:20 and 1:100) were incubated at room temperature (25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) in wells of 96 well plates. The absorbance of the mixtures was recorded between 300\u2013800 nm using a plate reader (Tecan infinite M1000 Pro, ThermoFisher, Scoresby, Australia) at different time points (0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 h). The pyocyanin concentration was consistent in all studies (100 \u03bcM). The absorbance of ascorbic acid, dehydroascorbic acid and citric acid alone were also recorded at the same time points.\nNMR spectroscopy analysis of pyocyanin-ascorbic acid interaction\nTo determine the proton NMR spectra of the pyocyanin-ascorbic acid complex, the pyocyanin-ascorbic acid mixture was prepared in sterilised deionised water to a ratio of 1:10 (pyocyanin 100 \u03bcM: ascorbic acid 1,000 \u03bcM) and incubated for 2 and 72 h at room temperature (25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C). After incubation, the samples were loaded in NMR tubes (ThermoFisher), and their 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer and applying the solvent (water) suppression technique (see Supplementary material). The chemical shifts (d) in peaks (parts per million; ppm) were recorded.\nDensity functional theory analysis of pyocyanin-ascorbic acid interaction\nThe DFT computational method, based on fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, was used to study the molecular interactions between pyocyanin and ascorbic acid. This work was conducted at Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC).\nChloroform extraction of pyocyanin-ascorbic acid\nPyocyanin-ascorbic acid mixtures were prepared to ratios of 1:20 (pyocyanin 50 \u03bcM: ascorbic acid 1,000 \u03bcM) and 1:100 (pyocyanin 50 \u03bcM: ascorbic acid 10,000 \u03bcM). These mixtures were incubated for 2 and 72 h at room temperature (25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C), followed by extraction of pyocyanin using the chloroform-HCl assay (Essar et\u00a0al., 1990; Kapadia et\u00a0al., 2022). In brief, the pyocyanin-ascorbic acid mixture was mixed with chloroform (Univar., Ingleburn, Australia) to a dilution factor of 300 \u03bcL of chloroform for every 1,000 \u03bcL of the mixture in 15 mL falcon tubes and vigorously shaken manually and vortexed immediately for 5 s followed by\ncentrifugation at 4500 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Chloroform separates residual pyocyanin in the mixture into a blue layer. The blue layer was carefully pipetted out into a new tube and then treated with 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) at a ratio of 500 \u03bcL of 0.2 M HCl for every 1,000 \u03bcL of blue solution. The HCl-blue pyocyanin mixture was again shaken manually, then immediately vortexed for 5 s and centrifuged for further 10 min (4,500 \u00d7 g; 4\u00b0C). The final acidified pyocyanin appeared as a top pink layer, and 200 \u03bcL of that pink layer was added to the wells of 96 well plates, and its absorbance was recorded at 520 nm using a plate reader. The absorbance given by pure pyocyanin was used taken as 100%, and the absorbance of the pyocyanin-ascorbic acid mixture was assessed with respect to pure pyocyanin.\nThe study of the interaction of pyocyanin and phenazine to DNA using circular dichroism\nA Chirascan Circular Dichroism spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, Applied Photophysics Limited, Surrey, United\u00a0Kingdom) was used to investigate the interaction between pyocyanin or phenazine and DNA. Mixtures of calf thymus double-stranded (ds) DNA (Sigma Aldrich, Australia) at 150 ng/\u03bcL with varying pyocyanin or phenazine (0, 25, 50 and 100 \u03bcM) concentrations in Milli-Q water were incubated at room temperature (25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) for 15 min. Following incubation, the absorbance of the mixture was scanned from 200\u2013320 nm (at a scan rate of 0.5 s/nm) in a 1 mm path-length quartz cuvette. Shifts in the DNA absorbance peaks due to pyocyanin/phenazine binding was recorded and plotted as CD-mdeg vs. wavelength-nm."

The complete disappearance of the pyocyanin peaks (around 6.2 and 6.4 ppm) and the appearance of new sets of NMR signals were observed after 72 h (at pH 7) as the result of the formation of a new species or a pyocyanin-ascorbic acid adduct. When the pH was not controlled, a similar change in the NMR signals was seen after 2 h, but after 72 h two additional signals at around 9.2 and 7.7 ppm were seen. Further detailed spectroscopic investigations are needed to determine the exact identity of these new signals. Nevertheless, the structural change of pyocyanin in the presence of ascorbic acid (Figure\u00a02) was confirmed by these NMR experiments. No such changes were observed when ascorbic acid was replaced by citric acid (at pH 7), even after 72 h of incubation under similar conditions.\nDensity functional theory prediction on pyocyanin-ascorbic acid interactions\nDensity functional theory (DFT) predicted two feasible H-bonding interactions between (i) the \u2013CH2OH unit of ascorbic acid with \u2013C=O of pyocyanin and (ii) the most acidic \u2013OH unit of ascorbic\nacid with \u2013C=O of pyocyanin (Figure\u00a03). Both these structures were optimised (unrestricted) by DFT using the B3LYP (Becke, 1993), function as implemented in the Gaussian 09 program and 6-31G(d,p) basis set for all elements, applying the aqueous solvation (SMD) model (Kromann et\u00a0 al., 2018). According to these calculations, both the orientations are of almost similar energies, favouring slightly (by 1.27 kJ/mol) the H-bond (with 1.73 \u00c5 bond distance) from \u2013CH2OH of ascorbic acid (Figure\u00a03A) over the other (with 1.63 \u00c5 bond distance) (Figure\u00a03B). Another function, B97D3 (Antony and Grimme, 2006), which has dispersion correction and is reported to be\u00a0more accurate for pi\u2013pi stacking interactions (unrestricted, including SMD model for aqueous solvation), identified that the H-bond (with 1.88 \u00c5 bond distance) from \u2013CH2OH of ascorbic acid (Figure\u00a0 3C) was more favourable (by 13.01 kJ/mol) over the other (with 1.71 \u00c5 bond distance) (Figure\u00a0 3D).

Interestingly, the combination of ascorbic acid and Fu-30, especially at the highest concentration (ascorbic acid 20 mM + Fu-30 20 \u03bcM), showed the greatest reduction in GFP production in comparison to Fu-30 and ascorbic acid treatment alone for all three QS receptors at every time point.\nThe combination of ascorbic acid and Fu-30 inhibited pyocyanin production\nAnalysis of Pyocyanin production by P. aeruginosa isolates grown for 24 h in the presence or absence of the combination of ascorbic acid and Fu-30 (Figure\u00a0 6A). There was a significant decrease in pyocyanin yield in both clinical and laboratory isolates when grown in the presence of the combination. When untreated, the P. aeruginosa strains\u2019 pyocyanin production as indicated by optical density ranged from (OD520 nm) 0.04 to 0.9, with UTI-62\nhaving the highest pyocyanin production. Whereas when treated with the combination of ascorbic acid and Fu-30, all strains had a significant decrease in pyocyanin production (OD520 nm) of 0.018 (Figure\u00a06B).\nThe combination treatment inhibited hemolysin activity\nFigure\u00a06C shows the laboratory strains MH602 and PAO1 did not produce hemolysin since there absorbance (OD545\u00a0 nm) is approximately 0.1 (similar to the base line) whereas, the clinical isolates produced hemolysin. When grown in the presence of the combination of ascorbic acid and Fu-30, the hemolytic activity of the clinical isolates decreased, with the decrease being more prominent among UTI isolates and at a 1:1 volume ratio (i.e., 100 \u03bcL blood: 100 \u03bcL P. aeruginosa cell-free supernatant). Whereas, at lower ratio of P. aeruginosa cell free supernatant to rabbit blood did not show any hemolytic activity.\nThe combination treatment reduced initial adhesion\nWhen grown in the presence of the combination of ascorbic acid and Fu-30 there was a significantly reduced adherence of bacteria especially after 8 h incubation for all isolates (Figures\u00a0 7A,B).\nFIGURE\u00a05 Impact of ascorbic acid (AA) and furanone-30 (Fu-30) and combination of both on P. aeruginosa quorum sensing. MH602 was used to study the effects of the lasR system (left hand side), whereas PAO1 was used to study rhlA (centre) and pqsR (right hand side). Fu-30 showed a decline in the production of GFP up to 8 h and the addition of AA alone showed considerable declines in GFP production at all time points. The combination of AA with Fu-30 showed the most decrease in the activity of all three QS systems, especially at AA 20 mM + Fu-30 20 \u03bcM.

            "text": "Reduction of pyocyanin results in a change of the intrinsic pyocyanin blue colour to brown over time at acidic and physiological pH. Previous studies with the thiol antioxidant glutathione had shown that glutathione directly interacts with pyocyanin and results in a pyocyanin-glutathione conjugate product (Cheluvappa and Eri, 2015; Das et\u00a0 al., 2015). Ascorbic acid is a reducing agent and rapidly undergoes two consecutive one-electron donation processes to form the ascorbate radical and dehydroascorbic acid (Padayatty and Levine, 2016). At physiological pH, ascorbic acid is predominantly present as the ascorbate monoanion (by interacting with dissolved oxygen) (Buettner, 1988; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2010; Back2health chiropractic wellness, 2020; Yin et\u00a0 al., 2022). A similar conjugate product to that with glutathione was predicted to have occurred between pyocyanin and ascorbic acid in the current study, given the evidence from the DFT model. Based on the DFT model, one of the very first probable interactions occurred through H-bonding between (i) the \u2013CH2OH unit of ascorbic acid with \u2013C=O of pyocyanin and (ii) the most acidic \u2013OH unit of ascorbic acid with \u2013C=O of pyocyanin (Figure\u00a0 3;\nSupplementary Figure S4). Pyocyanin structure changed in the presence of ascorbic acid. The changes indicated that ascorbic acid perturbed the pyocyanin aromatic ring, not through the intrinsic acidity of ascorbic acid (as citric acid and dehydroascorbic acid had no effect), but most likely via the intrinsic antioxidant property of ascorbic acid. Furthermore, whilst pyocyanin can intercalate with DNA and stabilise P. aeruginosa biofilms (Das et\u00a0 al., 2015), the structural modulation of pyocyanin by ascorbic acid resulted in it losing its planar architecture, which ultimately may hinder pyocyanin\u2019s ability to intercalate with nitrogenous bases of DNA (Figures\u00a04B,C).\nIn P. aeruginosa, population-dependent QS is activated through the secretion of AHLs and binding of AHLs to regulatory receptors, initially LasR and RhlA to promote further biosynthesis of LasR, RhlA and PqsR receptors, which activate the complete QS system activating virulence factor production and biofilm formation (Lee and Zhang, 2015). The structure of ascorbic acid (five-membered lactone ring) is analogous to AHLs (Han et\u00a0al., 2020), and Fu-30 is another analogue of AHLs and a known synthetic QS inhibitor (Zhao et\u00a0 al., 2018). Therefore, these two molecules may compete with P. aeruginosa intrinsic AHLs for LasR/RhlA interactions. The current study showed that Fu-30 was effective in reducing QS activity only during the initial hours of incubation, and after 24 h in the presence of Fu-30 P. aeruginosa could produce more GFP, that indicates activation of QS system and consequently impact pyocyanin biosynthesis (Figure\u00a05; Supplementary Figure S6). On the other hand,\nFIGURE\u00a07 Impact of combination treatment on P. aeruginosa adhesion. (A) The adhesion area of P. aeruginosa increased significantly for all isolates from 2 h to 8 h. (B) In the presence of a combo, the bacteria\u2019s total adhesion area stagnated, and the value remained the same for 2 and 8 h time points. (C,D) The microscopic image represents an example of P. aeruginosa isolate (UTI-62) adhesion at 2 and 8 h time points.

All experiments were conducted in n = 3 biological replicates.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 13 frontiersin.org\nascorbic acid maintained its inhibition of the QS system and decreased pyocyanin production throughout the 24 h incubation, albeit at 1000-fold higher concentration. Dehydroascorbic acid also showed similar QS inhibition (tested for LasR and PqsR) to its reduced form (ascorbic acid) (Supplementary Figure S6D). This indicates a possible structural similarity between dehydroascorbic acid and AHLs, which leads to competition in binding to the AHL receptor(s) and inhibition of the QS system. The antioxidant property of ascorbic acid is needed for its independent interaction with pyocyanin.\nThe combination of ascorbic acid and Fu-30 was more effective (in comparison to Fu-30 and AA alone) in reducing GFP production for all three QS receptors at all time points. Reduction in QS activity consequently impaired pyocyanin production and hemolysis of rabbit blood cells (Figures\u00a05, 6). Although ascorbic acid from 30 mM and above and Fu-30 at 30 \u03bcM, showed significant decreases in bacterial growth (in the case of ascorbic acid, probably due to the acidity of the growth environment, which was reduced to \u2264pH 5 at 30 mM and further below to \u2264pH 4 at 70 mM), it is important to note that the concentration of ascorbic acid (20 mM) and Fu-30 (20 \u03bcM) used in this study did not induce a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa\ngrowth (Supplementary Figure S6A). This indicates that the effects of the combination were not the result of any change in growth.\nThe combination of ascorbic acid and Fu-30 induced multiple changes, including to QS-mediated production of virulence factors such as hemolysin and pyocyanin, and ascorbic acid directly bound to pyocyanin resulting in its neutralisation of eDNA binding. Previous studies have shown that QS and pyocyanin are involved in biofilm development (Das et\u00a0 al., 2015, 2022), and pyocyanin binding to eDNA promotes P. aeruginosa surface adhesion, aggregation and biofilm formation (Das et\u00a0al., 2015). In addition to the impact of the combination on biofilm formation, the current study showed that the combination rendered mature biofilms significantly more suspectable to tobramycin. This indicated that the combination might be\u00a0a useful agent alone or combined with tobramycin to treat P. aeruginosa biofilm-mediated infections. Therefore, any possible toxicity of the combination was tested and shown to be\u00a0non-cytotoxic to a human fibroblast cell line. This is an important requirement for developing any new antibacterial strategy. Fibroblasts are crucial in wound healing, and future research will use the combination-based strategy to treat infected wounds in vivo models.\nFIGURE\u00a010 Cytotoxicity effect of the combo (AA 20 mM + Fu-30 20 \u03bcM) on HFF-1 cell lines. HFF-1, when exposed to combo, showed no cytotoxicity at both 24 and 48 h exposure time, whereas DMSO exhibited disruption in cell confluence and up to 50% cytotoxicity at 48 h time points (A,B). Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm. All experiments were conducted in triplicates. *Indicates p < 0.05.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 14 frontiersin.org\nTo conclude, this study has, for the first time, shown that the antioxidant ascorbic acid can directly interact with pyocyanin and modulate its structure and its DNA binding ability. Additionally, in combination with the furanone, Fu-30 can significantly hinder the QS system of P. aeruginosa and inhibit virulence factor production, promote biofilm disruption and increase the sensitivity of biofilms to tobramycin. This indicates that the combination may be\u00a0a new way to control the many infectious diseases caused by P. aeruginosa. Similar strategies can also be\u00a0trailed by combining antioxidants with surfactins derived from other bacterial species or plant-based derivatives to facilitate inhibition of pathogenic bacteria virulence production and biofilm formation and its associated infections (Kimyon et\u00a0al., 2016; Bhatwalkar et\u00a0al., 2021; Ali et\u00a0al., 2022)."
