            "text": "2 | P a g e\n3 | P a g e\nWhat is already known on this topic: 62 63 Annually in England, 370,000 emergency department attendances, 40,000 hospital 64 admissions, and 55 deaths are associated with injuries among children aged under 5. 65 These most commonly occur in the home and disproportionately affect those living in the 66 most disadvantaged communities. Between 2009-2011, a national home safety equipment 67 scheme was run which reduced injury-related hospital admissions. 68 69 70 What this study adds: 71 72 This study demonstrates that the national home safety equipment scheme reduced 73 admission expenditure by \u00a3924 per month per local authority, however the costs to run 74 the scheme meant that only a small amount invested was returned in cost-savings 75 associated with admission expenditure. 76 77 78 How this study might affect research, practice or policy: 79 80 The national home safety equipment scheme reduced hospital admissions, and is likely to 81 have reduced other attendances at emergency departments, primary care, and walk-in 82 centres. Our estimates of cost-effectiveness are conservative, and the gains associated 83 with the scheme are likely to be greater. 84 85\n4 | P a g e\nIntroduction 86 Unintentional injuries result in approximately 370 000 emergency department 87 attendances, 40 000 hospital admissions and 55 deaths amongst children aged under 5 88 annually in England. (1) Most of these injuries occur at home, and most are preventable. 89 (2) Those with a lower socio-economic status carry the burden of these injuries, with a 90 38% higher hospital admission rate for children living in the most deprived compared to 91 the least deprived areas. (1) 92 93 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on preventing 94 unintentional injuries in the under-15s recommend home safety assessments, the supply 95 and installation of home safety equipment and education and advice for families where 96 children are at greatest injury risk. This includes families with children aged under 5, those 97 living in rented or overcrowded conditions or those living on a low income. (3) These types 98 of home safety interventions have been shown to increase safety equipment possession 99 and use, improve home safety behaviours and reduce injuries. (4-10) Economic 100 evaluations of interventions to promote smoke alarm use (11-14), fire safety practices 101 (15), thermostatic mixer valve use (16), and poison prevention practices (17) have been 102 shown to be cost-effective, but there is little evidence of the cost-effectiveness of home 103 safety interventions aimed at reducing a wide range of injuries. (4) 104 105 One such intervention was the Safe At Home (SAH) National Home Safety Equipment 106 Scheme (https://www.rospa.com/home-safety/advice/safe-at-home), delivered between 107 2009 and 2011. The SAH scheme was designed and implemented by the Royal Society for 108 the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) on behalf of the Department for Education. One 109 hundred and thirty local authorities in England participated in the SAH scheme. These local 110 authorities were chosen based on hospital admission rates for injuries in the under 5s that 111 were higher than the national average rate. The SAH scheme provided home safety 112 assessments, advice and supplied and fitted a range of home safety equipment to 113 disadvantaged families with children aged under 5 who were receiving means-tested state 114 financial support. (18) The SAH scheme has previously been shown to significantly reduce 115 hospital admission rates, (5) reaching families with children at increased injury risk (19) 116 with high levels of parent satisfaction, (20) equipment use and other safety behaviours. 117 (19) However, no economic evaluation of the SAH scheme has been conducted to date. 118 The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the SAH 119 scheme for the prevention of hospital admissions in England compared to control areas 120 which did not receive the SAH scheme. 121 122 Methods 123 124 Objectives 125 The objectives of this study were to: 126 127 \u2022 Estimate the cost of delivering the intervention in SAH local authorities (LAs). 128 \u2022 Estimate hospital admission rates and associated expenditure in SAH and control 129 LAs while SAH was implemented. 130 \u2022 Estimate differences between hospital admissions and associated expenditure in 131 both areas over a four-year follow-up period. 132 \u2022 Estimate the cost-effectiveness of the SAH scheme. 133 134 Population 135 Children aged under 5 years old living in England (intervention and control LAs) and Wales 136 (control LAs only) between 1st April 2009 and 31st March 2015. 137 138 Intervention 139 Delivered between 01/04/2009 and 31/03/2011, the SAH scheme provided home safety 140 equipment and advice to disadvantaged families with children aged under 5 who were 141 receiving means-tested state financial support in 130 LAs in England. (5, 18) Data were 142\n5 | P a g e\nreported at the Lower-layer Super Output Area (LSOA) level, a geographical areas of 143 1,000-1,500 population within LA boundaries. (24) LSOAs within English LAs that 144 implemented SAH were identified as intervention LSOAs, however this was only possible 145 for 121 LAs. 146 147 Over 66,000 families received safety equipment, and 282,000 families received 148 information alone. The scheme included training for staff, home risk assessments, advice 149 and education for parents and free provision and installation of safety equipment including 150 safety gates, fireguards, window restrictors, non-slip bath/shower mats, kitchen cupboard 151 locks, corner cushions and blind cord shorteners. Participating families could decline 152 recommended equipment. (18) 153 154 Comparator 155 The comparator was usual care, defined as families with children aged under 5 not residing 156 within LAs participating in the SAH scheme and therefore not receiving SAH scheme advice 157 or equipment. Welsh local authorities, and English local authorities that did not implement 158 SAH were defined as controls. Each intervention LSOA was matched to one control LSOA 159 using 1:1 nearest neighbour matching using a propensity score, details of which we 160 provide elsewhere. (5) 222 LAs were matched as controls, 200 in England and 22 in Wales. 161 162 163 Outcomes 164 The effectiveness of SAH was captured using data on hospital admissions for unintentional 165 injuries, defined as having an admission coded as an unintentional injury which could 166 plausibly occur in the home in children aged 0-4 years. Admissions for intentional injuries, 167 injuries occurring outside the home (e.g. pedestrian injuries), and undetermined / 168 unspecified injuries were excluded. 169 170 Data 171 Hospital admission data for England was obtained from UK National Health Service (NHS) 172 Digital Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) in Admitted Patient Care (APC) data, and for Wales 173 from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank in Patient Episode 174 Database for Wales (PEDW) data. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents 175 (RoSPA) provided anonymised data on families who received the SAH scheme, while mid-176 year population estimates for children aged between zero and four years old in England 177 and Wales were obtained from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). All data were stored 178 securely within the SAIL Databank, part of the Secure eResearch Platform (SeRP). 179 180 Study design 181 We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from an NHS and local authority perspective, 182 based on data from a controlled interrupted time series study evaluating the impact of the 183 scheme on hospital admission rates. (5) The key criteria for the evaluation can be found 184 in Table 1. 185 186 Patient and Public Involement 187 188 Two colleagues from RoSPA were involved with the design of the study, costing of the SAH 189 scheme, and interpretation of results. 190 191 Costing the Safe at Home scheme 192 Unit prices for home safety equipment in 2009/2010 were provided by RoSPA, and were 193 inflated to 2018/2019 prices using the Hospital Pay and Prices Index (HPPI). (21) Unit 194 prices for equipment are given in Appendix 1. Other included costs were installation cost 195 (a flat fee applied when at least one piece of equipment was fitted), provision of home 196 safety advice, equipment storage and delivery, staff salary, and staff training. The SAH 197 intervention was intended to be delivered between 1/4/2009 and 31/3/2011. Any 198\n6 | P a g e\ninstallation dates reported before or after these dates were assumed to be installed on the 199 first/last date respectively. 200 201 Costing hospital admissions 202 Hospital admission injury and treatment codes were grouped into the relevant Health 203 Resource Groups (HRGs), which are standard groupings of ICD-10 diagnoses and OPCS 204 procedures that have similar resource implications for the NHS, taking into account length 205 of stay. HRG codes were grouped by fiscal year, then mapped to the relevant NHS 206 Reference Costs for England. (22, 23) Where a specific HRG was not identified, the average 207 cost across all HRGs for that particular year was applied, as recommended by the NHS 208 Reference Cost Team. (23) All healthcare expenditure was then inflated to 2018/2019 209 prices using the Hospital Pay and Prices Index (HPPI). (21) 210 211 Analytical strategy 212 Data were aggregated to LA level to be representative for decision makers. Expenditure 213 on admissions and the SAH intervention were estimated at the LA level, while for 214 admission rates, we defined a \u2018typical\u2019 LA as having 10,078 children aged 0-4 years based 215 on an estimated 3,507,201 children aged 0-4 years across 348 LAs in England and Wales 216 in 2011. (25, 26) All monthly admission rates and monthly healthcare expenditure were 217 split into the three time periods: T1 (implementation, 1/4/2009to 31/3/2011), T2 (first 218 follow-up, 1/4/2011 to 31/3/2013), and T3 (second follow-up, 1/4/2013 to 31/3/2015). 219 T1 represents the two year implementation period when families could access the SAH 220 scheme, and this was used as the comparison time period for the analysis. All monthly 221 SAH scheme costs were attributed to this time-period. The four years of follow-up was 222 split into two periods as some items of equipment (e.g. stairgates) are recommended for 223 use in children up to two years of age, while the other items of equipment supplied by 224 SAH may be required for longer periods. 225 226 For each LA, we estimated the monthly average admission rates, hospital admission 227 expenditure, and scheme costs (intervention LAs only). We did this for each of the pre-228 defined time periods and for all intervention and control LAs, separately. We examined 229 differences in hospital expenditure and admission rates separately for intervention and 230 control LAs by subtracting values for follow-up time periods (T2 and T3) from values for 231 the implementation period (T1). Values for differences in hospital expenditure and 232 admission rates for intervention LAs were then subtracted from control LAs. 233 234 We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per hospital admission 235 averted at either T2 or T3, relative to implementation at T1 and the cost-offset ratio (COR), 236 which measured scheme expenditure compared with changes in hospital admission 237 expenditure at either T2 or T3 compared with T1. 238 239 Sub-group and sensitivity analyses 240 Sub-group analyses were performed by stratifying by socio-economic deprivation tertiles 241 using 2001 Townsend Scores. (27) We also conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 242 details of which can be found in Table 1. 243 244 Secondary analyses 245 In line with other studies, we conducted a secondary analysis using a more restrictive code 246 list for hospital admissions which included only injuries which could have been plausibly 247 prevented by the SAH scheme equipment. (5, 6, 28, 29) The code list can be found 248 elsewhere.(30) Cord winders were excluded in this analysis because we did not identify 249 any recorded injuries which could have been prevented, and the costs associated with 250 these were removed. 251 252 Results 253 Data from 65,970 families that took part in SAH were included in the costing analysis, with 254 a total cost of implementing SAH of \u00a39,518,066 (Appendix A2). 98.5% of hospital 255\n7 | P a g e\nadmissions were mapped to an appropriate HRG, otherwise an average cost was applied 256 (Appendix A3). The total number of hospital admissions reported in the six-year study 257 period across all LAs was 202,223 (107,808 in intervention LAs, 94,415 in control LAs), at 258 a total cost of \u00a362,104,032 (\u00a331,322,637 in intervention LAs, \u00a330,781,395 in control LAs). 259 260 The SAH scheme was associated with a reduction in hospital admission expenditure and 261 hospital admission rates within intervention LAs compared with control LAs (basecase 262 analysis, Table 2). For T2 vs T1, a \u00a3490 reduction in admission expenditure per LA per 263 month and a 0.4 reduction in admissions per LA per month was observed between 264 intervention and control areas, which increased to a \u00a3924 reduction in admission 265 expenditure per LA per month and a 0.5 reduction in admissions per LA per month for T3 266 vs T1. The cost of delivering SAH was greater than hospital expenditure reductions for 267 both T2 vs T1 and T3 vs T1. The ICER per admission averted was \u00a36,862 for T2 vs T1, 268 decreasing to \u00a34,209 for T3 vs T1. CORs were \u00a30.15 for T2 vs T1 and \u00a30.29 for T3 vs T1, 269 suggesting that for every pound spent on the SAH scheme, 15p and 29p respectively was 270 returned in hospital admissions savings. 271 272 The probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Appendix A4) found that reductions in hospital 273 admissions and associated expenditure were significant (i.e. 95% CIs did not cross zero), 274 but the 95% CIs for the ICERs were wide, suggesting sizeable decision uncertainty. Cost-275 effectiveness acceptability curves suggested there was a 90% chance at T1 and 98% 276 chance at T2 that SAH was cost-effective if a LA was willing to spend \u00a320,000 to avert a 277 hospital admission (see Figure 1). Scatterplots suggested that in most cases the SAH 278 scheme led to a reduction in hospital admissions, although there were some scenarios 279 were it was estimated to have no effect (see Appendix 5). 280 281 Sub-group analyses 282 SAH was a targeted scheme, therefore most of the costs were seen in the most socio-283 economically deprived LAs (Table 2), but these LAs also had the largest reductions in 284 hospital admissions. The scheme cost remained greater than any reductions in 285 expenditure. ICERs per admission averted in the basecase analysis for the most deprived 286 tertile were \u00a317,086 (COR \u00a30.12) for T2 vs T1, and \u00a34,869 (COR \u00a30.06) for T3 vs T1. 287 Although the probabilistic sensitivity analysis findings were similar, 95% CIs were wider 288 such that only in T3 vs T1 for the most deprived tertile was there evidence of a reduction 289 in admissions. 290 291 Secondary analysis \u2013 equipment preventable injuries 292 Findings were similar to the main analysis with the SAH scheme leading to reductions in 293 hospital admissions and expenditure (see Table 3 and Appendicies 6 to 8). The main 294 difference in the secondary verses primary analyses was that reductions in expenditure / 295 admissions (and hence greater returns) were now found in T2 vs T1 rather than T3 vs T1. 296 When stratifying by socio-economic deprivation, the greatest reductions were observed in 297 high deprivation LAs as in the primary analysis. 298 299 Discussion 300 The SAH scheme appears to be cost-effective for reducing hospital admissions, although 301 the costs of the intervention are greater than savings in admission expenditure alone. As 302 SAH was a scheme targeted at those with high deprivation, the greatest reduction in 303 admissions was seen in those areas, but with a high intervention cost. Our analysis did 304 not consider other costs such as emergency department attendances, minor injury units, 305 primary care visits, NHS walk-in centres, education or social care so our study is likely to 306 underestimate the benefits of the SAH scheme across the wider health, education and 307 social care sectors. 308 309 Strengths and limitations 310 This study used routinely collected data to capture the impact of a national home safety 311 assessment and equipment scheme on hospital admissions for injury in a real-world 312\n8 | P a g e\nsetting. It would be logistically difficult and extremely costly to conduct a sufficiently large 313 randomised controlled trial to evaluate such a scheme using hospital admission as the 314 primary outcome measure. In comparison, we have been able to conduct a robust quasi-315 experimental controlled evaluation at reduced expense. The data were time-aggregated, 316 the time series design ensured the intervention exposure preceded the outcomes, which 317 reduces the potential for reverse causality. Furthermore, using hospital admissions data 318 and linked data on equipment provision reduced the potential for biases from parental 319 reports of injuries incurred or equipment provided. 320 321 We have focused only on hospital admissions and have excluded other types of medically 322 attended injury due to a lack of high-quality data on specific injury mechanisms from 323 emergency department attendances, minor injury units, primary care visits, or NHS walk-324 in centres across England and Wales. It is likely that the SAH scheme had an impact on 325 such health care utilisation, as previous studies have shown similar interventions reduced 326 physician visits and emergency department attendances. (4, 6, 10, 31) Wider impacts 327 would also include productivity losses associated with parents taking time off work to care 328 for their child and out of pocket costs to parents, for example for travel to hospitals and 329 for over the counter purchases. (32) Hence, our study will have underestimated the 330 potential benefit from the SAH scheme, especially around healthcare cost-savings. 331 Furthermore, policy makers such as NICE focus on direct costs and do not include 332 productivity losses in their decision making. (33) 333 334 Healthcare policy decision-making within England and Wales usually requires data on 335 quality adjusted life years, based on the EQ-5D.(33) Presently, EQ-5D is unsuitable for 336 use in children under the age of 5 years. Other paediatric quality of life tools have been 337 used in injured children (34-36), but no mapping to EQ-5D exists. Therefore, it was not 338 possible to collect and incorporate quality of life data into our evaluation. 339 340 In context with the literature 341 To our knowledge, this is the first economic evaluation of a national home safety 342 equipment scheme using real world data. Previous interventions to reduce unintentional 343 injuries have tended to focus on one type of injury e.g. burns associated with fire (11-15, 344 37), scalds (16, 38), and poisonings. (17) All but one of these interventions were found to 345 be cost-effective. (37) Only two studies have investigated interventions aimed at reducing 346 a wide range of injuries, (4, 39) and the findings from both studies are consistent with 347 ours. An evaluation of the English Sure Start programme which included home safety 348 education, found the intervention significantly reduced hospitalisations for injuries and 349 poisoning in the under-5s, but the financial benefits from reduced hospitalisations for all 350 causes offset approximately 31% of the provision cost of Sure Start. A second study 351 evaluating a Canadian home visiting programme providing safety advice and discount 352 coupons for safety equipment found the intervention decreased hospital expenditure in 353 the intervention areas, but cost more to deliver than it saved ($372 per injury avoided). 354 (4) 355 356 Implications for policy 357 358 Whilst we were not able to incorporate emergency department utilisation data in our 359 analysis, we can make some estimate of the impact of the SAH scheme on emergency 360 department attendance and its associated cost. It has been estimated that 370,000 361 children aged under-5 attend emergency departments each year in England following 362 unintentional injury. (1) The average cost of an emergency department attendance in 363 2018/2019 was \u00a3166 per attendance. (40) Focusing on intervention LAs only (38% of LAs 364 in England), and assuming that the SAH scheme is at least as effective at reducing 365 emergency department attendances as hospital admissions, we would expect an 366 approximate 4% reduction in injury attendances, preventing 5,561 emergency department 367 attendances annually and saving \u00a3923,207 per year in England. If this is added to the 368 savings from hospital admissions (\u00a31,364,459 per year), this equates to \u00a32,287,666 per 369\n9 | P a g e\nyear. The estimated total cost per year for delivering SAH was \u00a34,758,624 for the 121 370 intervention LAs, suggesting a potential return of investment of \u00a30.48 for every pound 371 spent on SAH. This is still likely to be an underestimate of the benefit of the SAH scheme, 372 as further savings may also be realised from other sectors such as primary care, minor 373 injury units, walk-in centres, education and social care. 374 375 Conclusion 376 Over four years after SAH was implemented, intervention areas experienced reduced 377 hospital admissions and associated expenditure, suggesting that SAH was effective. 378 However, any savings were outweighed by the intervention cost. Further investigation of 379 reductions in other healthcare areas is likely to improve the return on investment further. 380 381 382\n10 | P a g e\nAcknowledgements: We would like to thank Professor Sarah Lewis for her advice about 383 the statistical methods and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents for sharing 384 the safety equipment data and supporting the methodology and interpretation of this 385 analysis. 386 387 Contributors: EO, DK, CC, ET, MJ, SR, SM and MCW designed and obtained funding for 388 the study.
