            "text": "Pterygium is a common ocular surface disease with an overall global incidence as high as 12% (1). Pterygium is characterized by degeneration, hypertrophy, and hyperplasia of the bulbar conjunctiva and the subconjunctival tissue of the palpebral fissure. It progresses into the cornea and can destroy Bowman \u2019s membrane and superficial stromal layer of the cornea (2). The clinical hazards of pterygium include affecting aesthetics and corneal morphology, increased wavefront aberrations, irregular astigmatism of the cornea and decreased visual quality. In severe cases, decreased visual acuity and limited eye movements may also occur (3\u20137). Currently, no specific medical treatments are available. Pterygium excision combined with conjunctival autograft transplantation is currently the mainstream surgical approach owing to its low recurrence rate and few complications (8\u201310).\nPrevious studies have found that corneal densitometry (CD) measured by Pentacam gradually increases with age in healthy subjects (11\u201314). In addition to Pentacam, anterior segment optical coherence tomography and corneal confocal microscopy have also been reported to be useful for measuring CD values (15, 16). However, only Pentacam has been widely used in the study of different corneal diseases and surgeries due to its advantages of easy measurement, automatic, non-contact. Many ocular surface diseases, such as keratoconus, vernal keratitis, dry eye, and primary congenital glaucoma have an impact on CD (17\u201320). Anterior segment surgeries including small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE), femtosecond Laser-assisted In Situ Keratomileusis (FS-LASIK), implantable collamer lens (ICL) V4c implantation, and intrastromal Ferrara ring implantation also affect CD (21\u201323).\nNumerous studies have investigated and documented the impact of different pterygium sizes and pterygium surgeries on corneal status, including astigmatism, keratometry, and corneal topography (3, 4, 24, 25). The evaluation of pterygium-induced CD changes and the impact of pterygium surgery on CD using Scheimpflug imaging has not been documented in the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate pterygium-induced CD changes and the effects of pterygium surgery on CD."

The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Eye Hospital (No.2022KYPJ010). The requirement for individual consent was waived. The inclusion criteria were age >18 years and primary pterygium tissue growth in the nasal palpebral fissure area. Exclusion criteria were recurrent pterygium, temporal pterygium, pseudopterygium, conjunctival cyst, keratoconjunctival tumor, history of ocular trauma, history of ophthalmic surgery or other\nocular diseases affecting CD, and history of systemic diseases, such as hyperthyroidism, autoimmune diseases, and tumors.\nPterygium severity was graded according to the extent of pterygium growth, vascularization, and thickness according to previous studies (26). Severity was graded as mild (3\u20135 points), moderate (6\u20138 points), or severe (9\u201311 points). One hundred and fifty-five eyes of 109 patients with primary pterygium were included in this study. According to the severity of pterygium, three eyes graded as mild, 73 eyes as moderate, and 79 eyes as severe. As there were fewer patients with mild pterygium, they were combined with patients with moderate pterygium. As a result, only the mild-to-moderate group was compared with the severe group."

A Pentacam three-dimensional anterior segment analyzer (Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) was used by the same experienced doctor to obtain corneal morphological parameters and CD values. This examination was performed in a darkroom with the subject seated and the lower jaw placed on rest with fixation of the target in both eyes. Twenty-five Scheimpflug images of the cornea with different meridians were automatically acquired using three-dimensional scanning mode. CD, cornearelated parameters including central corneal thickness (CCT), flat-axis keratometry (K1), steep-axis keratometry (K2), corneal astigmatism, irregular astigmatism, and spherical aberration, can all be obtained by Pentacam measurements. CD ranges from 0 to 100 gray-scale units (GSU), with 0 representing complete clearing and 100 representing complete opacification of the cornea. CD was subdivided into four concentric radial regions based on corneal diameter, including the corneal apex to a diameter of 2, 2\u20136, 6\u201310, and 10\u201312 mm. The cornea was divided into three layers according to depth: the anterior 120 \u00b5m layer, center, and posterior 60 \u00b5m for the evaluation of CD."

            "text": "The CD is an important parameter used to assess corneal transparency and health. Our previous study showed that healthy corneal CD values were positively correlated with age and slightly positively correlated with keratometry and spherical aberration (14). Another study reported that CD values increased with age but did not correlate with corneal keratometry and refractive parameters in healthy participants (13). CD values of 0\u20136 mm in the\nFrontiers in Medicine 05 frontiersin.org\nanterior layer of the keratoconus cornea was reported significantly correlated with maximum keratometry, thinnest corneal thickness and keratoconus severity (18). This study showed that corneal keratometry, spherical aberration, corneal astigmatism, irregular astigmatism, CCT, and pterygium severity correlated with CD values of 0\u20136 mm in patients with pterygium.\nFrontiers in Medicine 06 frontiersin.org\nTo compare the CD values, normal eyes of patients with monocular pterygium were used as the control group, and confounding factors, such as age, sex, and general condition, were excluded to determine the effect of pterygium on CD. Our results showed that CD values of 0\u201310 mm in the anterior 120 \u00b5m, the center and full thickness, and 2\u20136 mm in the posterior 60 \u00b5m layer were significantly increased in the pterygium affected eyes compared with the contralateral unaffected eyes. CD values of 0\u201310 mm in the anterior 120 \u00b5m, center, and posterior 60 \u00b5m and total thickness were higher in patients with severe pterygium than in those with mild or moderate pterygium. Severe pterygium represents more active inflammation and more extensive invasion into the cornea than less severe pterygium. Previous studies have used confocal microscopy to observe the presence of inflammatory cells between the cornea and pterygium, and demonstrated that the density of inflammatory cells was significantly correlated with pterygium mobility score (27). In vivo laser scanning confocal microscopy also revealed that the density of corneal basal epithelial cells, anterior stromal cells, endothelial cells, and the length of corneal nerve fibers in the central cornea were higher than in the area near the head of the pterygium. However, dendritic cell density was lower in the former than in the latter (28). Decreased corneal transparency may be due to the irregular arrangement of collagen fibers, uneven distribution of keratocytes, and disruption of the extracellular matrix structure. Pterygium is characterized by cell proliferation and conjunctival tissue growth in the cornea, and inflammatory processes, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and destruction of the extracellular matrix may explain the increased CD observed in patients with pterygium (2). The pterygium severity grading was significantly associated with CD values of 0\u20132 and 2\u20136 mm annuli in the anterior 120 \u00b5m, central, and full-thickness of patients with pterygium. These findings suggest that CD may be considered as a potential parameter indicator of pterygium severity. Increases in CD values, measured using the Scheimpflug imaging system, have also been reported in other ocular surface diseases, such as keratoconus, vernal keratoconjunctivitis and dry eye, which may impair corneal transparency (17, 18, 20). CD is negatively correlated with visual acuity in patients with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) (19). Moreover, the CD value can also be used as a parameter to follow corneal and anterior segment surgical recovery. CD value measured by Scheimpflug imaging decreased in patients with myopia or myopic astigmatism 5 years after small incision lenticule extraction or femtosecond laserassisted LASIK (21). The author thought that the changes in CD may impact the subjective quality of vision and may be related to symptoms such as glare and halos. Other studies reported that the increase in CD values one day after ICL surgery and cataract surgery may be related to limbal corneal incision edema (23, 29). The increased of CD values at 4 years after ICL surgery correlated with age, preoperative spherical equivalent, uncorrected distance visual acuity, and intraocular pressure (IOP), may be related to the changes in metabolism and collagen fiber arrangement of the corneal endothelial cells due to age (23). CD in the anterior layer of the cornea is reduced after intrastromal corneal ring segments\nFrontiers in Medicine 07 frontiersin.org\nimplantation in patients with keratoconus and is correlated with corneal keratometry (22).\nThe results of this study showed that K1 was significantly increased, and CCT, corneal astigmatism, and irregular astigmatism values were significantly decreased after pterygium excision combined with conjunctival autograft transplantation. Our findings are consistent with those of other studies (30). After pterygium excision, the anterior cornea became significantly steeper, CCT became thinner, and the total astigmatism, anterior corneal astigmatism asymmetry, and high-order aberration power were significantly reduced (30). The magnitude of astigmatism caused by pterygium depends on the traction force associated with corneal flattening caused by the horizontal extension length of the pterygium and its vascularity (31). Our study compared CD values 1 month after surgery with those before surgery and showed that pterygium excision not only changed the morphology of the cornea, but also significantly restored corneal transparency. The CD values of the anterior and full thickness of the cornea at 2\u20136, 6\u201310, and 0\u201312 mm, the center layer at 0\u201312 mm and the posterior layer at 0\u20132 mm after pterygium surgery in our study were significantly lower than those before surgery. Because pterygium mainly invades Descemet\u2019s membrane and the superficial stromal layer of the cornea, it has a greater effect on CD of the anterior and center layer than posterior layer after pterygium excision. A previous study measured changes in corneal scar densities by Pentacam showed that CD significantly decreased in the anterior layer and increased in the posterior layer at 12 weeks compared with 1 week after pterygium surgery in 31 cases (32). And the CD values in the anterior layer continued to decrease 18 months after pterygium surgery (33). However, more postoperative time periods and more sample sizes are still needed to investigate the effect of pterygium surgery on CD at different layers of the cornea.\nThis study has some limitations. First, this study was retrospective, and few cases of mild pterygium were included. Although we analyzed the relationship between pterygium severity and CD value, more patients with mild pterygium are needed for further investigation. Second, as the pterygium tissue invades the cornea from the conjunctiva, the corneal optical density values analyzed in this study encompass 10\u201312 mm, however, this range may be affected by the corneoscleral limbus, and some patients have a corneal diameter below 12 mm, therefore, the reproducibility and predictability of this region are poor (13). Therefore, we analyzed the correlation between CD values and corneal parameters only at 0\u20132 and 2\u20136 mm from the cornea, which is more representative. Third, the follow-up period after the pterygium surgery was short. The difference was observed between one month after surgery and before surgery. Dynamic changes in CD values should be evaluated at multiple time points and over a longer follow-up period."

CD values were correlated with pterygium severity and corneal parameters. Our findings show that pterygium excision combined with conjunctival autograft transplantation can reduce CD values. Dynamic long term\npostoperative changes in CD values and the effect of mild pterygium on CD values warrant further investigation."
