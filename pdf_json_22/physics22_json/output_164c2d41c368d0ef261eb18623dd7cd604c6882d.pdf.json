    "abstractText": "The modification of the \u03c6 meson spectrum in nuclear matter is studied in an updated QCD sum rule analysis, taking into account recent improvements in properly treating the chiral invariant and breaking components of four-quark condensates. Allowing both mass and decay width to change at finite density, the QCD sum rule analysis determines certain combinations of changes for these parameters that satisfy the sum rules equally well. A comprehensive error analysis, including uncertainties related to the behavior of various condensates at linear order in density, the employed renormalization scale and perturbative corrections of the Wilson coefficients, is used to compute the allowed ranges of these parameter combinations. We find that the \u03c6 meson mass shift in nuclear matter is especially sensitive to the strange sigma term \u03c3sN , which determines the decrease of the strange quark condensate in nuclear matter. Specifically, we obtain a linear relation between the width \u0393\u03c6 and mass shift \u0394m\u03c6 given as \u0393\u03c6 1\u20444 a\u0394m\u03c6 \u00fe b\u03c3sN \u00fe c with a 1\u20444 \u00f03.947\u00fe0.139 \u22120.130 \u00de, b 1\u20444 \u00f00.936\u00fe0.180 \u22120.177 \u00de and c 1\u20444 \u2212\u00f07.707\u00fe4.791 \u22125.679 \u00de MeV.",

Allowing both mass and decay width to change at finite density, the QCD sum rule analysis determines certain combinations of changes for these parameters that satisfy the sum rules equally well. A comprehensive error analysis, including uncertainties related to the behavior of various condensates at linear order in density, the employed renormalization scale and perturbative corrections of the Wilson coefficients, is used to compute the allowed ranges of these parameter combinations. We find that the \u03d5 meson mass shift in nuclear matter is especially sensitive to the strange sigma term \u03c3sN , which determines the decrease of the strange quark condensate in nuclear matter. Specifically, we obtain a linear relation between the width \u0393\u03d5 and mass shift \u0394m\u03d5 given as \u0393\u03d5 \u00bc a\u0394m\u03d5 \u00fe b\u03c3sN \u00fe c with a \u00bc \u00f03.947\u00fe0.139\u22120.130 \u00de, b \u00bc \u00f00.936\u00fe0.180\u22120.177 \u00de and c \u00bc \u2212\u00f07.707\u00fe4.791\u22125.679 \u00de MeV.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.105.114053\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe emergence of hadron masses larger than a few hundred MeV from quarks lighter than 10 MeV and gluon dynamics governed by the strong interaction is one of the still not fully understood phenomena of QCD [1,2]. While the effect of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking [3,4] is widely believed to be at least in part responsible for the hadronic mass generation [5\u20138], it remains difficult to experimentally confirm this theoretical scenario. One promising experimental strategy that has been pursued during the past decades is to study the behavior of hadron masses in extreme conditions such as finite temperature and/or density, because chiral symmetry is expected to be at least partially restored in such environments (see Ref. [9] for a recent review). If hadron masses are hence really generated even partially by chiral symmetry breaking, they should be modified in hot and/or dense matter. Furthermore, chiral symmetry breaking can naturally explain the mass difference between chiral\npartners [10], so that if chiral symmetry is restored, the mass difference between them can be expected to vanish [11,12]. Based on these motivations, worldwide experiments have indeed been performed attempting to measure hadronic mass shifts at finite temperature or density [13\u201317]. In this work, we focus on the finite density behavior of the \u03d5 meson, which has recently attracted much theoretical [18\u201326] and experimental [27\u201335] attention. On the theoretical side, following the original works of Refs. [7,36], the QCD sum rule analysis of Ref. [18] demonstrated that a clear relation exists between the \u03d5 meson mass shift in nuclear matter and the strange sigma term \u03c3sN , which governs the decrease of the strange quark condensate within the linear density approximation, hs\u0304si\u03c1 \u2243 hs\u0304si0 \u00fe \u03c3sNms \u03c1, where \u03c1 represents the baryon density andms is the strange quark mass. Furthermore, Ref. [26] showed that the longitudinal and transverse modes of the \u03d5 meson, which at finite density generally become independent due to the broken Lorentz symmetry, have different nontrivial dispersion relations, which could be manifested in distinct peaks in the respective dilepton spectrum for nonzero spatial momentum with respect to the nuclear matter rest frame. Moreover, there is a multitude of recent works studying the \u03d5 meson spectral function at finite density using hadronic effective theories [19\u201324]. Experimentally, no consensus has yet been reached on how the \u03d5meson behaves in nuclear matter.

[27,30,31]. On the other hand, the recent ALICE measurement of the \u03d5N correlation function in Ref. [35] led to a determination of the \u03d5N channel scattering length with a large real part corresponding to an attractive interaction (hence suggesting a negative mass shift) and a small imaginary part (suggesting weak broadening effects). Interestingly, the absolute value of the thus obtained scattering length is much larger than what was measured in earlier \u03d5 meson photoproduction experiments [37,38]. It is hoped that the situation will be clarified at the ongoing JPARC E16 experiment, where pA reactions with various target nuclei will be probed to measure the finite density dilepton spectrum in the \u03d5 meson mass region [34]. There is also a proposal to measure at J-PARC not only the dilepton, but also the K\u00feK\u2212 spectrum from the same pA reactions, which would serve not only as an important consistency check, but also provide opportunities for new measurements thanks to the much higher statistics and to the larger branching ratio of this channel with different angular dependencies of the outgoing particles, which might allow the separation of the longitudinal and transverse modes [39]. For the theoretical study in this paper we make use of the QCD sum rule method, including the following two major improvements compared to previous works. First, we take into account the possibility of broadening in the phenomenological parametrization of the spectral function, following similar approaches in Refs. [40,41]. As discussed already in these previous works, the broadening effect has to be introduced as a new and independent parameter in the sum rule analysis. It is then no longer possible to uniquely determine both mass shift and width of the \u03d5 meson from the sum rules, but strong correlations between them. Second, we consider the chiral properties of the fourquark condensates that appear in the \u03d5 meson sum rules by separating them into chiral symmetric (e.g., invariant) and chiral breaking parts and treating the two contributions independently. This allows us to study the role of chiral symmetry restoration not only from the conventional chiral condensate of mass dimension 3, but also the dimension 6 four-quark condensates [42]. Moreover, it becomes possible to go beyond the usually applied vacuum saturation approximation. Two of the present authors have already applied this advanced treatment of the four-quark condensates to the study the finite density behavior of light vector and axial-vector mesons and nucleon and delta resonances [45] and have, for instance, found that the masses of the chiral partners \u03c1 and a1 become degenerate with a mass of about 550 to 600 MeV in the vacuum with restored chiral symmetry [42].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we recapitulate our treatment of the four-quark condensates, paying attention to the specific condensates needed for the \u03d5meson sum rule. This is followed by a general description the QCD sum rule approach in Sec. III. The results of this work are summarized in Sec. IV, starting with a discussion of the vacuum \u03d5 meson sum rule in Sec. IVA, which provides the baseline of the later finite density analysis, given in Sec. IV B. The main features and physical consequences of the obtained findings are discussed in Sec. V, after which the paper is concluded in Sec. VI."

A four-quark condensate typically has the following general form, which can be written in terms of disconnected (dis) and connected (con) pieces of the quark propagator denoted by the respective subscripts,\nh\u00f0q\u0304\u0393q\u00de\u00f0q\u0304\u0393q\u00dei \u00bc hTr\u00bdSiq\u0393 Tr\u00bdSiq\u0393 idis \u2212 hTr\u00bd\u0393Siq\u0393Siq icon; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere \u0393 is an arbitrary matrix that can contain Dirac, color and/or flavor components. The summation in i \u00bc B, S does not include cross terms as the Dirac matrix in \u0393 will only allow one type to contribute. As shown in Eq. (4), SBq is\n114053-2\nproportional to the density of zero modes so that a general four-quark condensate can be expressed as,\nh\u00f0q\u0304\u0393q\u00de\u00f0q\u0304\u0393q\u00dei \u00bc h\u00f0q\u0304\u0393q\u00de\u00f0q\u0304\u0393q\u00deiB \u00fe h\u00f0q\u0304\u0393q\u00de\u00f0q\u0304\u0393q\u00deiS; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere the subscript B and S represent the chiral symmetry breaking and symmetric parts, respectively, and the former is proportional to \u03c12\u00f00\u00de. Let us now consider the four-quark condensates appearing in the \u03d5 meson sum rule which are the following three types:\nh\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de2i; h\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03b35\u03bbas\u00de2i; h\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de\u00f0u\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbau\u00dei: \u00f07\u00de\nFor the condensate h\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de\u00f0u\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbau\u00dei, as is clear from its flavor structure, only the disconnected term contributes. Since the symmetry breaking quark propagator vanishes due to the trace Tr\u00bd\u03b3\u03bcSBq \u00bc 0, it is a chiral symmetric condensate,\nh\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de\u00f0u\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbau\u00dei \u00bc h\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de\u00f0u\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbau\u00deidis;S: \u00f08\u00de\nThe other two condensates have contributions from both the chiral symmetry breaking and symmetric parts. One first notes that, both have disconnected and connected contributions. For the connected piece, using the property\ni\u03b35SBs i\u03b35 \u00bc \u2212SBs ; \u00f09\u00de\none can write the breaking part in the two condensates as a single operator with an overall sign depending on its Dirac structure. In summary, one finds\nh\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de2i \u00bc h\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de2idis;S \u00fe h\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de2icon;S \u00fe h\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de2icon;B;\nh\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03b35\u03bbas\u00de2i \u00bc h\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03b35\u03bbas\u00de2idis;S \u00fe h\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de2icon;S \u2212 h\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de2icon;B: \u00f010\u00de\nIn the following analysis, we will first use the experimental values of the mass and width of the meson of interest to estimate the value of the four-quark condensates appearing in its vacuum sum rule. As discussed, the fourquark condensates will be composed of the chiral symmetric and breaking parts. We will then use the vacuum saturation hypothesis to estimate the values of the fourquark operators. Within this approximation, the symmetric operators will vanish, while the breaking operators will become proportional to the square of the quark condensate, hq\u0304qi2. For convenience, we introduce an auxiliary parameter \u03ba defined as their ratio.\n\u03ba \u00bc M Mv:s: ; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere M is the total magnitude of the four-quark condensates extracted from our sum rule method and Mv:s: is the total magnitude expected from the vacuum saturation hypothesis. \u03ba \u00bc 1 corresponds to the case of using the vacuum saturation of the four-quark condensates. For the sum rules of the \u00f0\u03c1; a1\u00de mesons that form chiral partners, the four-quark condensates contributing to the respective OPE can be shown to have the same contribution from the chirally symmetric part but a breaking part contributing with different coefficients. Therefore, both contributions can be determined uniquely. It should be noted that not all vector mesons (JP \u00bc 1\u2212) have chiral partners with JP \u00bc 1\u00fe. This is so because the vector meson octet mixes with the singlet. For example, an ideally mixed \u03c9 meson is invariant under SU(2) chiral rotation, while the \u03c1 mixes with the a1 [44]. This implies that the number of independent combinations of four-quark operators appearing in the \u00f0\u03c9; fq\u0304q1 \u00de sum rules is more than two so that determining them from the two parity sum rules is no longer possible. On the other hand, as the difference between \u00f0\u03c1; a1\u00de and \u00f0\u03c9; fqq\u03041 \u00de sum rules arises due to the disconnected diagrams, one can estimate these matrix elements from comparing the respective phenomenology and thus obtain the values of all combinations of chiral breaking and symmetric operators appearing in the sum rules for the latter pair. Furthermore, assuming the contributions of disconnected diagrams to be flavor independent, one can estimate the values of chiral symmetry breaking and symmetric operators appearing in the \u00f0\u03d5; fss\u03041 \u00de as well as all other spin 1 sum rules [45]."

On the other hand, to ensure a reasonable convergence of the OPE, we require the contribution of the condensate terms to be smaller than that of the perturbative term.

This condition restricts the Borel mass M to be larger than Mmin. The threshold parameter s0 is chosen so that the minimum mass in the Borel curve for mass is located at the center of the Borel window. The mass and kappa values are taken at the extremum point."

Similar to the (\u03c9\u00f0782\u00de, fqq\u03041 \u00f01285\u00de) pair, they are not exact chiral partners, but parity partners.

The light-flavor disconnected four-quark condensates appearing in the sum rules of the \u03c9 and fss\u03041 channels, were evaluated in Ref. [45]. Taking into account that there are two light flavors compared to one strange, we get\nh\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03b35\u03bbas\u00de2idis;S \u00bc 1 4 h\u00f0q\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03b35\u03bbaq\u00de2idis;S;\nh\u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbas\u00de2idis;S \u00bc 1 4 h\u00f0q\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bbaq\u00de2idis;S; \u00f026\u00de\nwhere q stands for the isospin doublet. The values of the light flavor four-quark condensates can be obtained from the following equations, discussed in detail in Ref. [45].\n114053-5\nIn the second line, fqq\u03041 stands for f ss\u0304 1 \u00f01285\u00de, the parity partner of the \u03c9 meson. The two disconnected four-quark operators on the right-hand side of Eq. (27) are chiral symmetric operators and are, respectively, the additional four-quark operators that appear in the \u00f0\u03c9; fqq\u03041 \u00de sum rules. While these operators are responsible for the difference\nbetween the isospin singlet and triplet currents, and spoil the chiral parity relation between \u00f0\u03c9; fqq\u03041 \u00de, their values can be obtained by combining the results from \u00f0\u03c1; a1\u00de. The numerical results of the analysis performed in Ref. [45] are given in the first four lines of Table II. The 5th and 6th lines show the results for the \u03ba values in the \u03d5 and fss\u03041 channels obtained from Eq. (19) with phenomenological inputs for the corresponding masses and widths. Figure 1 depicts the Borel curves for \u03ba\u03d5 and \u03bafss\u0304\n1 , while Fig. 2 shows the Borel\ncurve for the corresponding masses, using the obtained \u03ba values demonstrating a stable Borel curve and thus confirming our analysis."

The chiral symmetry breaking operator hBssiB is assumed to take a form proportional to hs\u0304si2\u03c1, in which hs\u0304si\u03c1 is modified according to Eq. (28). The behavior of the chiral symmetric operators hSiS at finite density is much less clear, because the restoration of chiral symmetry cannot be used here as a guiding principle. To explore the full range of possibilities, we consider two extreme cases, which will then be used to estimate the uncertainties of the final results caused by this unknown density dependence of hSiS. First, we assume the terms in hSiS to remain constant at their vacuum value, without any density dependence. For the second case, we take them to have the same relative modification as the chiral symmetry breaking term explained above. The results of our analysis are shown in Fig. 3, together with the result reported by the KEK E325 experiment [28] (red square). The boundaries of the color bands in this plot are obtained from two principle sources of error. The first is the uncertainty coming from the choice of the renormalization scale (\u03bc \u00bc 1 GeV or \u03bc \u00bc 2 GeV), which dominates the error for small \u03c3sN values. The second is related to the treatment of the chiral symmetric four-quark condensates. As discussed above, we consider two extreme cases and estimate the uncertainty introduced by this choice. The later error increases with increasing \u03c3sN , and hence leads to thicker error bands for larger \u03c3sN values. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the latter error dominates for \u03c3sN \u2273 100 MeV. Finally, inspecting Fig. 3, one notes that the solutions that satisfy the sum rules with different mass shift and\ndecay width values lie on an essentially linear curve, which allows us to express our result in a simple analytic expression. By fitting the curves of Fig. 3, we obtain\n\u0393\u03d5 \u00bc a\u0394m\u03d5 \u00fe b\u03c3sN \u00fe c; \u00f031\u00de\nwhere a \u00bc \u00f03.947\u00fe0.139\u22120.130\u00de, b \u00bc \u00f00.936\u00fe0.180\u22120.177\u00de and c \u00bc \u2212\u00f07.707\u00fe4.791\u22125.679\u00de MeV."

            "text": "The main result of our in-medium analysis is given in Fig. 3 and Eq. (31). For a fixed value of \u03c3sN , we see that the sum rules allow for either a large increase of the decay width or (for most cases) a mass reduction for the \u03d5 meson in nuclear matter (or a combination of the two). Without any additional input, it is not possible to distinguish the different scenarios. However, limiting the in medium decay width to values below 50 MeV, which lies within predictions of most effective model calculations [19\u201324], one can determine the \u03d5meson nuclear matter mass shift with a precision of about 10 MeV. Conversely, using the available experimental results on the \u03d5 meson decay width and mass shift in nuclear matter, the result of Fig. 3 allows us to determine a range of \u03c3sN values that are consistent with the sum rules. The finding of the KEK E325 experiment [28], indicated as a red square in Fig. 3, can, for instance, be understood to be consistent with a strangeness sigma term of about \u03c3sN \u223c 125 MeV. As previously pointed out in Ref. [18] and again confirmed here, this finding does not agree with recent lattice QCD calculations of this quantity [53\u201355], which get values of\n114053-7\naround \u03c3sN \u223c 50 MeV (see also Refs. [9,49] for compilations and detailed discussions of the lattice QCD calculations). It will be interesting to see whether the J-PARC E16 experiment and further experimental studies at HADES and ALICE will confirm the KEK E325 result and if the above-mentioned inconsistency persists. It is also possible that the discrepancy can be resolved by allowing a much larger change in the chiral symmetric four-quark condensate. In fact, as can be seen in Fig. 4 allowing the chiral symmetric operator to decrease to about 20% (45%) of the vacuum value with parameters chosen at \u03bc \u00bc 1 \u00f02\u00de GeV, one finds that the KEK E325 result could be consistent with \u03c3sN \u223c 50 MeV. We would then have to understand the origin of the large medium effect of the chiral symmetric operators."

            "text": "We have in this work studied the behavior of the \u03d5 meson in nuclear matter, making use of a QCD sum rule approach that takes the chiral properties of the four-quark\ncondensates properly into account and furthermore allows for not only an in-medium \u03d5 meson mass shift, but also broadening in the phenomenological parametrization of the spectral function. As a result, we find that while the sum rules can be satisfied by multiple combinations of mass shift and broadening scenarios, the range of allowed modification parameters can be strongly constrained by the value of the strangeness sigma term \u03c3sN . Specifically, an increasing value of \u03c3sN will lead to a larger negative mass shift, but not much influences the magnitude of the inmedium decay width (see Fig. 3). In the future, two major items could be considered to further improve the accuracy of the QCD sum rule predictions given in this work. First, nonzero momentum effects should be taken into account along the lines of Refs. [26,36], especially in view of the fact that most experimentally measured \u03d5 mesons in nuclear matter are not at rest with respect to the medium and finite momentum effects therefore should be accounted for. Second, the finite-density behavior of the chiral symmetric four-quark condensates are still largely unknown, the related uncertainty hence substantially contributing to the size of the error bands shown in Fig. 3. It remains a challenging theoretical task to constrain this behavior through model or lattice QCD calculations. On the experimental side, we can expect a lot of new data coming out during the next few years, not only from the ongoing J-PARC E16 experiment [34], but also more precise data becoming available from experiments at HADES [33] and ALICE [35]. We expect that these new data, combined with further improved theoretical calculations, will lead to a more complete understanding of the behavior of the \u03d5 meson in nuclear matter and, eventually, of the relationship between its properties and chiral symmetry of QCD."
