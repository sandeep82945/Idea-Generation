    "abstractText": "Background: The aim of this single-center retrospective study is to evaluate the long-term outcome after convergent procedure (CP) for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), persistent AF and long-standing persistent AF. Methods and results: We analyzed outcomes of patients that underwent CP from January 2009 until July 2020. 119 patients with paroxysmal AF (23.5%), persistent AF (5.9%) or long-standing persistent AF (70.6%) that attended long-term follow up were included. The outcome was assessed at 1-year after CP and at long-term follow up. At 1-year follow up rhythm and daily AF burden were assessed for patients with implantable loop recorder (61.2%). For others rhythm was assessed by clinical presentation and 12-lead ECG recording. At long-term follow up patients having sinus rhythm or unclear history of AF were monitored with 7-day ECG Holter and AF burden was determined. Long-term success was defined as freedom from AF/atrial flutter (AFL) with sinus rhythm on 12-lead ECG recording and AF/AFL burden <1% on 7-day Holter ECG. Repeat catheter ablations (RFA) prior to long-term follow up were documented. At 1-year follow up 91.4% of patients had sinus rhythm and 76.1% of patients had AF/AFL burden <1%. At long-term follow up (8.3 \u00b1 2.8 years) 65.5% of patients had sinus rhythm and 53.8% patients had AF/AFL burden <1% on 7-day holter ECG. Additional RFAs were performed in 32.8% of patients who had AF or AFL burden <1%. At long-term follow up age, body mass index and left atrial volume index were associated with increased risk of AF recurrence. Conclusions: CP resulted in high long-term probability of sinus rhythm maintenance. During long-term follow-up additional RFAs were required to maintain sinus rhythm in a substantial number of patients.",

The outcome was assessed at 1-year after CP and at long-term follow up. At 1-year follow up rhythm and daily AF burden were assessed for patients with implantable loop recorder (61.2%). For others rhythm was assessed by clinical presentation and 12-lead ECG recording. At long-term follow up patients having sinus rhythm or unclear history of AF were monitored with 7-day ECG Holter and AF burden was determined. Long-term success was defined as freedom from AF/atrial flutter (AFL) with sinus rhythm on 12-lead ECG recording and AF/AFL burden <1% on 7-day Holter ECG. Repeat catheter ablations (RFA) prior to long-term follow up were documented.\nAt 1-year follow up 91.4% of patients had sinus rhythm and 76.1% of patients had AF/AFL burden <1%. At long-term follow up (8.3 \u00b1 2.8 years) 65.5% of patients had sinus rhythm and 53.8% patients had AF/AFL burden <1% on 7-day holter ECG. Additional RFAs were performed in 32.8% of patients who had AF or AFL burden <1%. At long-term follow up age, body mass index and left atrial volume index were associated with increased risk of AF recurrence.\nConclusions: CP resulted in high long-term probability of sinus rhythm maintenance. During long-term follow-up additional RFAs were required to maintain sinus rhythm in a substantial number of patients."

            "text": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a worldwide epidemic that results in significant burden on public health and health care system (1,2). The incidence and prevalence of AF is consistently increasing\nthroughout the years (2,3). Patients with AF have increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia, and mortality (4,5). Higher AF burden decreases health-related\nquality of life (6\u20138).\nSeveral treatments for AF have been developed with catheter ablation for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) being a Class IA indication for paroxysmal AF treatment (9). However, more successful in improving the outcomes of AF ablation than medical therapy, the success rate of catheter ablation for persistent and longstanding persistent AF is to this date still far from being adequate (10,11).\nConvergent procedure (CP) is a multidisciplinary solution for treatment of AF that involves epicardial ablation of the left atrium with minimally invasive surgical approach and endocardial catheter ablation. It was demonstrated to be superior in treating persistent AF compared to endocardial-only ablation strategy in the CONVERGE trial (12,13). Additionally, it was shown to be superior in improving the outcomes in patients with paroxysmal AF (14,15).\nHowever, few studies were published exploring the long-term outcomes of the CP (12,16\u201318). The objective of our retrospective analysis is to evaluate the very long-term outcome for patients with paroxysmal, persistent, and longstanding persistent AF that underwent CP."

Later, a subxiphoid, transthoracic approach was utilized.\nIn transdiaphragmatic approach access to posterior wall of left atrium was obtained under CO2 insufflation into the abdominal cavity using laparoscopic instruments inserted through three abdominal trocars as described previously (19). Pericardial window was created through the central tendon of the diaphragm and pericardium. The Subtle\u2122 cannula (Atricure, Mason, OH, USA/nContact, Morrisville, NC, USA) was inserted into the oblique sinus, providing a direct view of the posterior left atrium through endoscope. The epicardial radiofrequency (RF) ablation device Numeris\u00ae or Episense\u2122 (both Atricure, Mason, OH, USA/nContact, Morrisville, NC, USA) was introduced through the cannula, adjacent to the endoscope. Under direct endoscopic visualization interconnected epicardial lesions were created, as shown in Figure 1. During epicardial ablation ice cold saline was injected into the pericardial sac since February 2010 to minimize heating of adjacent structures and periprocedural complications.\nIn subxiphoid approach incision was made directly under the sternum and the pericardial space was entered just above the diaphragm. Procedure was performed similarly as in transabdominal approach. Since 2015 the lesion set was focused more on ablating the whole posterior left atrium as shown in Figure 2.\nAfter epicardial ablation, incisions were closed, and endocardial ablation followed."

Majority of patients in sinus rhythm (79.6% at one year and 87.5% at long-term follow up) were off AADs. We found that age, BMI and LAVI were predictors of long-term outcome. AF recurrence importantly increased with time. To maintain sinus rhythm at long-term follow up 32.8% of patients required at least one additional catheter ablation.\nThe multicenter, randomized Convergent trial demonstrated superiority of CP in patients with longstanding persistent AF with 73.7% effectiveness regardless of AAD use compared to 44.4% in the catheter ablation arm at 12 months (22). Recently published randomized clinical trial HARTCAP-AF showed 89% and 36% freedom from any supraventricular tachyarrhythmia lasting >30 seconds off AADs at 12 months after convergent ablation and catheter ablation respectively (23). Similarly, Varzaly et al. performed a meta-analysis where sinus rhythm\nmaintenance at 79.4% was demonstrated after CP at 19 months follow up (24).\nImportantly, outcomes for sinus rhythm maintenance after CP have been shown to decline over years. In a recent meta-analysis Eranki et al. showed freedom from AF of 78.2% and 73.6% at 1 and 3 years after CP respectively (16). In the latest study Pannone et al. reported ATs free survival without AADs in non-paroxysmal AF 76.7% at 12 months, 67.5% at 24 months, 60.5% at 36 months, 53.6% at 48 months, and 46.1% at 60 months (17).\nOur results for short-term and mid-term outcome are consistent with studies mentioned above and previous studies from our group (14,18,25). However, our current study reports the longest follow-up after CP, with 53.8% freedom from AF/AFL recurrence at a median of 8.3 years.\nLong-term results that are available for catheter ablation demonstrate low success rate in catheter ablation of persistent and long-term persistent AF. In Hamburg study, success rate of 45% was reported after multiple ablation procedures at \u226550 months (26). In a meta-analysis Ganesan et al. reported 3-year freedom from AF in patients with non-paroxysmal AF at 41.6% and 77.8% following a single catheter ablation and multiple procedures respectively (27). However, most of the studies included in meta-analysis performed follow up with 24-hour Holter, transtelephonic ECGs and some only performed symptom\u2010related follow up, which is a less accurate method of detecting AF recurrence. The analysis of CIRCA-DOSE trial showed that sensitivity of detecting AF recurrence increased with the duration of rhythm monitoring. Serial short duration holter ECG monitoring (24-/48-hour) missed a substantial number of recurrences and less accurately estimated AF burden, however serial long-term monitors (14- day) had sensitivity closer to gold standard of continuous ECG monitoring (28). It is assumed that non-pulmonary vein substrate, located mainly on posterior wall of the left atrium and left atrial remodeling significantly contribute to sustaining arrhythmia in persistent and longstanding persistent AF (29,30). More extensive and durable transmural lesions of posterior wall with direct ablation of epicardial connections between endo- and epicardium and autonomic ganglia located in epicardial fat pads (31) resulting in homogenization of posterior wall (32) could play a major role in maintaining a sinus rhythm after CP."

            "text": "We report 10.9% of periprocedural major complication rate, 8.4% of minor periprocedural complications and 2.5% of major long-term adverse events. The complication rate is high, however our cohort included patients from the beginning of implementation of the CPs in our\ncenter. As previously reported in first 20 patients who underwent CP two patients developed atrio-esophageal fistulas and died. An extensive hospital investigation resulted in implementation of additional safety measures such as esophageal temperature monitoring, termination of RF energy dictated by esophageal temperature increase, cooling of pericardial space during epicardial ablation, minimization of endocardial ablation along the posterior wall of left atrium, implementation of esophagoscopy (19). We believe that these modifications by our group, implemented since February 2010, resulted in widespread use of CP on a global level, because they clearly demonstrated safety from atrio-esophageal fistulas, if the CP was done in a single setting. Since then, no atrio-esophageal fistulas or deaths occurred. Our results are consistent with previous research, which show major complication rate after CP between 0 and 20.8%, with a pooled complication rate of 5.53% (16,33\u201335). In a single center study Larson et al. showed that transitioning from transdiaphragmatic to subxiphoid approach enhances safety profile and significantly reduces complications. They reported major complication rate of 23% and 3.8% after CP with transdiaphragmatic or subxiphoid approach, respectively. Most complications were related to entering the abdominal cavity (31). However, subxiphoid approach results in poorer accessibility to the anterior segments of pulmonary veins hence only posterior wall of left atrial can be ablated epicardialy, which could reduce procedure\u2019 success. Selecting patients for the CP, the expected risks of the procedure and benefits of sinus rhythm maintenance must be thoughtfully weighed."

            "text": "Our study has some obvious limitations. Firstly, it is a single-center retrospective study, which somewhat reduces the importance of our conclusions. Secondly, there was some possible bias related to the inclusion of patients as a substantial number of patients that had received CP in our center refused to perform long-term ambulatory visit. Thirdly, although our study included a relatively large sample size, data for calculations of predictors of recurrence were available only for a smaller sample. Fourthly, for simplification purposes a cut off of <1% AF burden was used as absence of AF in analysis of ILR and 7-day holter recordings. The used cut off might correlate better with clinical outcomes, however, if a stricter cut off of any 30 s AF episode was used instead, it might increase the detection of AF recurrences. On the other hand, our group clearly demonstrate the evolution of CP from its initial phase to mature procedure, which was actually implemented in major centers around the world."
