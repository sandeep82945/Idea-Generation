    "abstractText": "In this work, we apply the sequential processing (SqP) method to address the relatively low electron mobility in recent all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) based on the polymerized smallmolecule acceptor (PSMA). Compared to the blend-casting (BC) method, all-PSCs composed of PM6/PY-IT via the SqP method show boosted electron mobility and a more balanced charge carrier transport, which increases the FF of the SqP device and compensates for the short-circuit current loss, rendering comparable overall performance with the BC device. Through film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy, we analyze the sub-layer absorption and exciton generation rate in the vertical direction of the device, and discuss the effect of the increased electron mobility on device performance, accordingly.",

            "text": "As a promising green and renewable energy technology, thin-film organic solar cells (OSCs) have received worldwide interest and have developed quickly in recent decades due to their advantages, such as light weight, low cost, semitransparency, and flexibility [1\u20137]. Non-fullerene OSCs, in which small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) or polymer acceptors replace fullerene derivatives, are attracting significant attention in light of their easily tunable energetics and good light absorption and large charge mobility. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of non-fullerene OSCs approaching 19% have been reported [8]. With the synthesis of new materials and the exploration of new structures, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) consisting of p-type polymer donors and n-type polymer acceptors have attracted increased attention due to some of their distinctive features, such as enhanced electronic structure tunability, outstanding mechanical durability and stability, and excellent film-formation capability suitable for roll-to-roll manufacturing [9\u201311]. Notably, polymerizing small\u2013molecule acceptors (SMAs) to construct polymer acceptors (PSMAs) has boosted the PCEs of the all-PSCs to over 15% recently [12\u201317], yet this still lags behind the state-of-the-art efficiencies from non-fullerene OSCs [18]. This is mainly due to the difficulty in morphology regulation of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blend films in all-PSC active layers [19]. The active layer fabricated by the polymeric donor and acceptor usually affords an amorphous BHJ morphology with low polymer crystallinity and pure phase when the using one step blend-casting (BC) method [20]. This is mainly because polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2058. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14102058 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2058 2 of 12\nhave a strong tendency to intertwine and entangle with neighboring chains, even in the solution [21]. To optimize the BHJ morphology, sequential processing (SqP), also called layer-by\u2013 layer deposition, has been considered as an effective way to form a pseudo-bilayer configuration via two-step deposition of the donor and acceptor, sequentially, which is beneficial to enhance vertical phase separation and afford a purer donor/acceptor phase to accelerate the hole/electron transport [22\u201326]. Some literature has confirmed that using the SqP method can fabricate higher efficiency of fullerene OSCs/non-fullerene small-molecule acceptor OSCs [27\u201330]. In addition, as donor and acceptor layers can be processed and optimized independently, the SqP method makes the active layer less dependent on the donor/acceptor ratio, solvent additive, etc., compared with the BC method. Therefore, it is easier to enhance film quality of active layers by choosing the SqP approach over BC, indicating that SqP can provide higher performance with better reproducibility in larger-area devices than BC [25]. Zhang et al., in 2018, reported high-performance large-area OSCs fabricated by using the SqP technique [31]. Despite these advantages, the SqP method is barely used for the advancement of all-PSCs, especially those based on PSMAs, let alone high efficiencies. This is because the formation of a SqP active layer relies on the swelling of the underlayer by the top solution and the interdiffusion between the two donor and acceptor materials, and the polymers\u2019 high molecular weights hinder themselves when diffusing into the donor film in all-PSCs. In this work, we present a sequentially processed all-PSC with PM6 as the electron donor and PY-IT, a PSMA, as the electron acceptor (Figure 1a). The nanomorphology of PM6 and PY-IT is finely manipulated through SqP assisted by a solvent additive and thermal annealing, but the same selective organic solvent used in all-PSCs devices by either SqP or BC. A small amount of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as a solvent additive was added during the deposition of the top solution to tune the swelling of the underlayer. As a result, optimal PCEs of 15% were successfully achieved for all-PSCs composed of PM6/PYIT by using the SqP method. Furthermore, to study the effect of swelling, we prepare another device whose underlayer (PM6) was thermally annealed before the deposition of the top solution, which is denoted by \u201cdonor thermally annealed (DTA)\u201d. These SqP and BC devices are characterized by film-depth-dependent absorption spectroscopy (FLAS), FTPS-EQE, ideality factor analysis, etc. It reveals that the SqP method makes PM6/PY-IT have a larger fill factor (FF) due to the more balanced carrier mobility and less bimolecular recombination. Furthermore, analysis on the FLAS result shows that there are more excitons generated in the bottom half of the device where the electrons need to transport through a longer distance to reach the top (cathode) compared to the holes to the bottom, which further highlights the significance of increasing the electron mobility via the SqP method.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2058 3 of 12Poly ers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 12\nFigure 1.

(2) For PM6/PY-IT (SqP), the PM6 was dissolved in chloroform (the concentration of the donor was 8 mg mL\u22121), and the acceptor PY-IT was also dissolved in chloroform (the concentration of the donor was 9 mg mL\u22121) and 1-chloronaphthalene (2% vol) as an additive, and both solutions were stirred overnight in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The donor solution was spin-casted at 2500 rpm for 30 s onto the PEDOT:PSS films, and then the donor solution was spin-casted at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto the donor films, followed by a temperature annealing of 95 \u25e6C for 5 min. (3) For PM6/PY-IT (SqP-DTA), the thermal annealing at 90 \u25e6C for 5 min was carried out after the donor film was spin-casted, then the other steps were the same as outlined in (2). For all types of devices, methanol with a 0.5% vol. acetic acid blend solution of PNDITF3N at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL\u22121 was spin-coated onto the active layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s.

The device architecture of the electrononly devices was ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Ag, and that of the hole-only devices was ITO/MoOx/active layer/MoOx/Ag. The charge carrier mobilities were determined by fitting the dark current into the model of a single carrier SCLC according to the equation: J = 9\u03b50\u03b5r\u00b5V2/8d3, where J is the current density, d is the film thickness of the active layer, \u00b5 is the charge carrier mobility, \u03b5r is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, and \u03b50 is the permittivity of free space. V = Vapp \u2212 Vbi, where Vapp is the applied voltage and Vbi is the offset voltage. The carrier mobilities were calculated from the slope of the J~V2 curves.

The film surface is incrementally etched by the soft ion source, without damage to the materials underneath the surface, which is in situ monitored by a spectrometer. From the evolution of the spectra and the Beer-Lambert\u2019s Law, film-depthdependent absorption spectra were extracted. The composition distribution along the film-depth direction was obtained from the film-depth-dependent spectra. The exciton generation contour was numerically simulated upon inputting film-depth-dependent light absorption spectra into a modified optical transfer-matrix approach.

(g) Ratio of hole mobility and electron mobility.\nTo understand the differences of charge recombination among devices based on different active layers, we first performed the dependence of JSC on the light intensity (Plight). Figure 3a exhibits the JSC and light intensity (JSC-Plight) curves, which are plotted on a logarithmic scale with a slope of S, as listed in Table 1. The closer the parameter S is to 1, the weaker the bimolecular recombination in the active layer. The bimolecular recombination of PM6/PY-IT (SqP-DTA) (S\u2248 0.979) was the highest, followed by PM6:PY-IT (BC) (S \u2248 0.981), and PM6/PY-IT (SqP) (S\u2248 0.998) with the lowest bimolecular recombination. This indicates that the SqP method can reduce the bimolecular recombination of the active layer when compared to BC, which is consistent with the trend of FFs of the corresponding devices. To examine trap-assisted recombination, ideality factors (nid) were calculated. When the ideality factor is approaching 1, the trap-assisted recombination is less, based on diode theory. Otherwise, more trap-assisted recombination makes the value become higher (typically <2). We can obtain the ideality factors in the following two ways. The first is to calculate ideality factors (nid,l) under different light intensities by nid,l = q kT \u2202Voc \u2202 ln(I) , where I is the light intensity. The results are shown in Figure 3b and Table 1. The nid,l values of PM6:PY-IT (BC), PM6/PY-IT (SqP), and PM6/PY-IT (SqP-DTA) were 1.248, 1.254, and 1.272, respectively. The nid,l values of PM6:PY-IT (BC) and PM6/PY-IT (SqP) were very close, lower than that of PM6/PY-IT (SqP-DTA), which indicates less trap-assisted recombination across the active layer of the SqP-based or BC-based device than that of the SqP-based device with extra thermal annealing (DTA). The second way is to fit the exponential region of the dark J-V curve, where the dark ideality factor (nid,d) can be calculated by nid,d = q kT \u2202V \u2202J , where q, k, T, V, and J represent the fundamental charge, the Boltzmann constant, temperature, bias voltage, and dark current density, respectively. The dark J-V curves are plotted in Figure 3c and the fitting results are listed in Table 1, where nid,d values are listed alongside the series (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the devices. The nid,d values of PM6:PY-IT (BC), PM6/PY-IT (SqP), and PM6/PY-IT (SqP-DTA) were 1.474, 1.449, and 1.496, respectively. The trend of nid,d of these three devices was almost consistent with that of nid,l, with SqP-DTA showing the highest ideality factor and thus the most trap-assisted recombination. These results imply that the SqP method without extra annealing can reduce not only bimolecular recombination, but also trap-assisted recombination, compared to BC.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2058 7 of 12\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 12\nrecombination. These results imply that the SqP method without extra annealing can re-\nduce not only bimolecular recombination, but also trap\u2010assisted recombination, compared\nto BC.\nFigure 3.

The\nsub\u2010gap EQEs were measured using Fourier\u2010transform photocurrent spectroscopy\n(FTPS), and the spectra of the BC\u2010 and SqP\u2010based devices are shown in Figure 3d. It shows\nclear quantum efficiencies for PM6:PY\u2010IT (BC) in the low\u2010energy region of 1.2\u20131.25 eV,\nwhich is probably attributed to the existence of deep trap states within the bandgap. This\nmay contribute to the relatively poor FF of the device.\nTo deeply understand the relationship between charge transport property, vertical\ncomposite distribution, and device performance, the charge carrier mobilities of active\nlayers processed by different methods were first measured by fitting the dark J-V2 data of\nsingle\u2010carrier devices to the space\u2010charge limited current (SCLC) model. The results are\npresented in Figure 4 and Table 1. For PM6:PY\u2010IT (BC), unbalanced mobilities for both the\nhole and electron were measured to be 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, respectively,\nwhich is consistent with its inferior photovoltaic performance since unbalanced carriers\u2019\nmobilities may result in severe bimolecular recombination to restrain the FF. PM6/PY\u2010IT\n(SqP) with balanced mobilities for the hole and electron were tested to be 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 4.2\n\u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, respectively, indicating that the SqP method may enhance the PM6/PY\u2010\nIT phase purity to improve the carriers\u2019 (hole and electron) transport pathway.

We prepared pure PM6 films and PM6:PY-IT blend films according to the same procedure used to fabricated devices. For DTA films, we took AFM images on the PM6 film before and after the extra thermal annealing step, and on the SqP blend films as well. The figure below is the new Figure 6 in the revised manuscript. There are several discussion points we can make from the AFM measurements: (1) For pure PM6 films before (Figure 6a) and after thermal annealing (Figure 6c), the roughness was reduced much more after thermal annealing (TA), and TA made the fibrillar structure of PM6 more obvious with elongated fibril chains, suggesting that the crystallinity was enhanced. This also implies that its swelling capability was reduced during the spin-coating of the acceptor\u2019s solution, which is not conducive to the interpenetration of the donor and the acceptor. (2) For both PM6:PY-IT (BC) and PM6/PY-IT (SqP), PY-IT appeared on the top surface. However, compared to PM6:PY-IT (BC), there seemed to be much more PY-IT distributed on the surface of PM6/PY-IT (SqP), which is a more favorable state in terms of the vertical phase segregation of the active layer. (3) The comparison between the SqP and SqP-DTA films indicated that the surface of PM6/PY-IT (SqP-DTA) had less PM6 than that of PM6/PY-IT\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2058 9 of 12\n(SqP), suggesting that excessive phase separation may occur in the active layer, particularly in the vertical direction due to the insufficient swelling for the PM6 underlayer, which is not conducive to the device performance. (4) Compared with SqP devices, the surface roughness of BC devices was higher, which may be caused by the relatively more uniform mixing between PM6 and PY-IT that led to more PM6 in the upper layer than in SqP devices.
