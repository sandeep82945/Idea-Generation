    "abstractText": "The system of two resources R1, R2 and one consumer C is investigated within the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model with Holling type II functional response. The rates \u03b2i of consumption of resources i = 1, 2 are coupled by the condition \u03b21 + \u03b22 = 1. The dynamic switching is introduced by a maximization of C: d\u03b21/dt = (1/\u03c4)dC/d\u03b21, where the characteristic time \u03c4 is large but finite. The space of parameters where both resources coexist is explored numerically. The results indicate that oscillations of C and mutually synchronized Ri which appear at \u03b2i = 0.5 are destabilized for \u03b2i larger or smaller. Then, the system is driven to one of fixed points where either \u03b21 > 0.5 and R1 < R2 or the opposite. This behaviour is explained as an inability of the consumer to change the preferred resource, once it is chosen.",

            "text": "The seminal papers by Lotka and Volterra [1, 2] initiated the research of modeling ecological processes [3, 4]. Apart from the original system of one prey and one predator, the case of two preys and one predator plays a particular role as it is relatively simple and therefore can be investigated analytically [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nHere we are interested in the way how the predator (termed as consumer C hereafter) distributes the rates of consumption of the preys (termed as resources Ri, i = 1, 2 hereafter). If C and Ri change in time, this distribution can also\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n11 91\n0v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\nbe time-dependent. In particular, these rates can be simply proportional to the amounts of resources Ri. For more complex cases, when this proportionality is absent, the term \u2019switching\u2019 has been coined [10].\nIn a series of papers [5, 11, 12] various mathematical expressions (logistic, exponential) have been applied to model an optimal switching of the distribution of the rates of consumption between two resources. There, the rate of consumption dC/dt has been maximized. This rate has been taken directly from the equation of motion. The optimization process has been applied immediately, i.e. each point of the trajectory has been optimized. In other words, the timescale of the optimization was assumed to be much shorter, than the timescale of the dynamics itself. On the other hand, the effect of delay of action of resources with respect to preys has been discussed in [13, 14]. There, the delay time was a fixed parameter.\nHere we propose to use a direct and continuous drift of the rates as to increase C (and not dC/dt) during the time evolution. As we have no direct expression for C(t), our task is numerical. Further, we do not assume an instant optimization. Instead, the process of maximization is running with a finite speed, which is proportional to a perceived gain of the consumer. Namely, the larger is the increase of C with the rate, the larger the speed is. Finally, the rates of the choice of this or that resource are coupled by the condition that the sum of these rates is constant. This condition can be understood as the limitation of time devoted to handling resources. Within this time, the consumer has a choice."

Further, p is the attack rate of the consumer, b is the functional response term of the consumer, and m is the mortality rate of the consumer [15].\nThe setting (1-3) is supplemented here by two more equations. First is the condition, that the rate of consumption is limited; the consumer has to make a\nchoice between R1 and R2, hence \u03b22 = 1\u2212 \u03b21. The second equation\nd\u03b21 dt = 1 \u03c4 dC d\u03b21 (4)\nis related to the decision of the consumer C. Namely, he intends to modify the coefficients \u03b2i as to get the maximal value of C. The time evolution of the \u03b2\u2019s is assumed to be slower than this of C and Ri, hence the time scale \u03c4 is longer than one.

            "text": "We would like to compute dCd\u03b21 . For this purpose, we make the following steps:\n1) We write our set of equations for C and R1, R2 putting \u03b22 = 1\u2212 \u03b21. We also change notation in this section, and write \u03b2 instead of \u03b21. We have\ndC\ndt = pC \u03b2R1 + (1\u2212 \u03b2)R2 1 + b(\u03b2 R1 + (1\u2212 \u03b2)R2) \u2212mC (5)\ndR1 dt = R1(1\u2212 \u03b111R1 \u2212 \u03b112R2)\u2212 pR1\u03b2 C 1 + b(\u03b2 R1 + (1\u2212 \u03b2)R2) (6)\ndR2 dt = R2(1\u2212 \u03b121R1 \u2212 \u03b122R2)\u2212 pR2(1\u2212 \u03b2)C 1 + b(\u03b2 R1 + (1\u2212 \u03b2)R2) . (7)\nFor our discussion, we can introduce the vector function y = (C,R1, R2) and identify the system above with\ny\u2032(t) = f(y, \u03b2), y(t0) = y0; (8)\nwe denote the solution to this Cauchy problem with y(t, t0, y0, \u03b2); we omit the other parameters since they are fixed.\n2) We recall a result concerning the dependence of the solution to (8) on \u03b2. It is show that the vector function dd\u03b2 y(t, t0, y0, \u03b2) solves the following Cauchy problem [16] d\ndt z = \u2202yf(y, \u03b2) z +\nd\nd\u03b2 f(y, \u03b2), (9)\nwith the initial value z(t0) = 0. We denote with \u2202yf(y, \u03b2) the Jacobian of f (the r.h.s. of (5) - (7)) with respect to y = (C,R1, R2).\nTherefore we obtain dCd\u03b2 (t) = z1(t). Consequently, we obtain a differential equation for \u03b2:\nd\u03b2 dt = 1 \u03c4 dC d\u03b2 = z1 \u03c4 . (10)\nNotice we have to compute seven variables (C,R1, R2, z1, z2, z3, \u03b2) by solving the coupled system (5), (6), (7), (9) and (10), with given initial conditions\n(C(t0), R1(t0), R2(t0), \u03b2(t0)), and zj(t0) = 0, j = 1, 2, 3.\nTwo hints can be added to limit the space of parameters. First, in the lack of consumers (here: if C = 0) there is a non-zero fixed point:\nR\u22171 = \u03b122 \u2212 \u03b112\n\u03b111\u03b122 \u2212 \u03b112\u03b121 (11)\nR\u22172 = \u03b111 \u2212 \u03b121\n\u03b111\u03b122 \u2212 \u03b112\u03b121 (12)\nTo keep R\u2217i positive, we should assume either diagonal elements \u03b1ij larger than non-diagonal ones, or the opposite; our choice is the former. Second, for one pair \u2019consumer-resource\u2019, the stability of a limit cycle demands that p \u2212 mb > 2(b + 1)/p. As we are interested in limit cycles, we keep p = 3.0, b = 2.0 and m < 0.5, if not stated otherwise.\nEquations (1-3) are solved with conventional Runge-Kutta 4 method. Equation (5) needs some care, because we have no analytical function C(\u03b2). Therefore at each time step we calculate C(\u03b2 + ) and C(\u03b2 \u2212 ). Then the new value of \u03b2 is\n\u03b2(t+ dt) = \u03b2(t) + C(\u03b2 + )\u2212 C(\u03b2 \u2212 )\n2\ndt \u03c4 (13)\nTypically, = 5\u00d7 10\u22126, if not stated otherwise. Also m = 0.2, p = 3.0, b = 2.0 \u03b112 = \u03b121 = 0.65, and \u03b111 = \u03b122. In the next section we concentrate on the role of \u03b1ii, \u03c4 and \u03b21(t = 0)."

            "text": "If, as noted above, the matrix \u03b1ij is symmetric, the transformation \u03b2i \u2192 \u03b23\u2212i should not change the outcome; only the values of Ri are interchanged. As a consequence, at the point \u03b2i = 0.5 the derivative \u03b4C/\u03b4\u03b2i = 0, hence d\u03b2i/dt = 0. There we observe oscillations of C and of R1 = R2; both resources perfectly synchronize and behave as one. The loop C vs R is shown in Fig. 1. This phase will be termed as phase A from now on.\nA small shift, about 0.01, of the initial value of \u03b21 from the symmetric value 0.5 drives the system to a different state, which itself depends on \u03c4 . For values of 1/\u03c4 small enough, the absolute value of the difference |\u03b2i \u2212 0, 5| increases to about 0.03 and remains there, with small periodic oscillations. The stationary behaviour of C and Ri, termed here as phase B, is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe necessary condition of the appearance of phase B is the stability of this phase for 1/\u03c4 = 0. In Fig. 3 we show the real parts of the eigenvalues of the related Jacobian in three-dimensional space C,R1, R2. They appear to be negative in two narrow windows near \u03b2i = 0.465 and 0.535. Details on these fixed\npoints are given in the Appendix.\nIt is characteristic that for \u03b21 > 0.5, the resource R1 is less than R2, and the opposite. This result indicates, that the consumer maintains her/his initial preference, imposed by the choice of the initial condition on \u03b2i. This is so despite the fact, that the more exploited resource is less abundant. On the other hand, the variable C in phase B (about 0.71) is slightly larger than the time average of C in phase A (about 0.68).\nThe small oscillations of \u03b2i in phase B, barely visible in Fig. 4 and expanded in Figs. 5a, 5b and 5c, are a consequence of finite \u03c4 , as their period is about to be doubled when \u03c4 increases five times. The behaviour is remarkable: \u03b21 increases linearly, then falls into oscillations, dropping down, then again increases and so on. This behaviour of \u03b2i induces similar variations of C and Ri (Fig. 2). In Figs. 6a, 6b and 6c the dependences C(\u03b2), R1(\u03b2) and R2(\u03b2) are shown, within the time range where the amplitudes of the oscillations are relatively large (as near the center of Fig. 5b). There we see the loops at each dimension.\nFor the parameter 1/\u03c4 above some critical value 1/\u03c4\u2217, the more exploited resource Ri entirely vanishes. Still, the consumer C maintains her/his initial preference; once R2 = 0, \u03b21 decreases to about 0.15, and if R1 = 0, \u03b21 increases to about 0.85. On the other hand, in both cases C increases to about 1.4. This phase is termed G from now on.\nThe critical values of 1/\u03c4\u2217 at the boundary between the phases B and G are shown in Fig. 7, for different values of \u03b1ii. Actually, the transition to phase G is caused by a collision of the trajectory Ri(t) with the invariant manifold Ri(t) = 0. As shown in Figs. 8a and 8b, this collision can happen at a transient stage, and it is not easy to disentangle the deterministic character of this transition. Despite of this difficulty, the boundary between the phases is quite smooth.\nFurther, a difference of \u03c4\u2217 appears between the plots for \u03b2i = 0.5 and for its other values. This difference can be attributed to stronger transient oscillations of Ri\u2019s, observed for the state where \u03b2i = 0.5.\nIf we start simulations from the state where R2 = 0, obviously the symmetry of an interchange \u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 is lost. In this case, the system is driven to the phase G for any initial value of \u03b21, if only \u03c4 is finite. The case of infinite \u03c4 is an exception; there, the time evolution of \u03b2i is blocked, and the problem is reduced to the standard case of one consumer and one resource [4]."

            "text": "The phase A can be considered to be close to the limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, where the evolution of coefficients \u03b2i can be neglected. The synchronization of R1 and\nR2, observed in this phase, effectively reduces the problem to the case of one consumer and one resource. As it was demonstrated in [4], the solution is a stable limit cycle. This means in particular, that the fixed point at \u03b2i = 0.5 is unstable. The same cycle is observed in phase A, if the initial values of the rates \u03b2i are equal to 1/2. As the whole problem is symmetric with respect to an interchange of \u03b21 and \u03b22, and \u03b21 = 1\u2212\u03b22, the derivative dC/d\u03b2i = 0 at this point, and the time evolution of the coefficients \u03b2i is blocked. In the phase B this symmetry is broken, as the coefficients \u03b2i are different.\nSome analogy can be drawn with the classical Landau theory of phase transitions [17]. There, suppose that \u2206 = \u03b2\u22121/2, and C(\u03b2) = e\u22062\u2212f\u22064 (with e, f - positive constants) plays the role of a negative potential which is maximized in a stationary state. Within this setting, \u2206 = 0 is a meta-stable state A, at a local minimum of C(\u2206). The phase B appears to be stable, with the non-zero value of \u2206. However, this analogy remains incomplete, because actually the problem is 4-dimensional, with variables C, R1, R2 and \u03b21. The fixed point at \u03b21 = 0.5 in the space (C,R1, R2) is unstable and a limit cycle appears there, in accordance with literature. Further, once the dynamics of \u03b21 is enabled, this limit cycle is unstable itself.\nThe dynamics of \u03b2i(t), shown in Figs. 5a, 5b and 5c indicates that the periodic trajectory contains a part wounded onto a torus and a part where the time dependence is linear. This picture can be seen as a periodic orbit with two successive Hopf bifurcations [18], where the driving force along the orbit is due to finite speed d\u03b2i/dt.\nThe phase G - a stable fixed point - appears for smaller values of the characteristic time \u03c4 . We observe that its stability is not a consequence of the time evolution of \u03b2i, as this phase is stable also in the limit of \u03c4 infinite. The role of the evolution is to drive \u03b21 to a final value (from any one less than 0.5 to about 0.15), passing from the phase B to the phase G. We add that for \u03c4 infinite, R2 = 0 and \u03b21 larger than some critical value (about 0.62 for \u03b111 = 0.95, other parameters as above) the fixed point of the phase G is unstable and periodic oscillations of C and R1 are restored.\nSummarizing the results, in the presence of the evolution of the coefficients \u03b2i the relatively large oscillations of the variables C and Ri in the phase A appear to be unstable, and they persist only at \u03b2i = 0.5. The finite speed 1/\u03c4 is supposed to drive the system to larger value of C. However this evolution keeps the system at the smaller Ri, leaving less exploited the resource which is more abundant. The difference between the resources Ri is caused just by the difference of their exploitation, measured by the coefficients \u03b2i. As the manifold \u03b2i = 0.5 is invariant, the consumer is not able to switch to the larger resource. For even shorter time \u03c4 , the system is driven from the phase B to a stable fixed point in the phase G, where one of the resources Ri vanishes."

The related determinants are\nD = \u03c6[(\u03b121 + \u03b112)\u03b21\u03b22 \u2212 \u03b122\u03b221 \u2212 \u03b111\u03b222 ] D1 = \u03c6(\u03b21\u03b22 + w\u03b112\u03b22 \u2212 w\u03b122\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b222) D2 = \u03c6(\u03b21\u03b22 + w\u03b121\u03b21 \u2212 w\u03b111\u03b22 \u2212 \u03b221) D3 = w(\u03b111\u03b122 \u2212 \u03b112\u03b121) + \u03b21(\u03b112 \u2212 \u03b122) + \u03b22(\u03b121 \u2212 \u03b111)\nand the solution is R1 = D1/D, R2 = D2/D, and C = D3/D. Analysis of signs of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian indicates, that this fixed point is unstable in the whole range of \u03b21, except two narrow bands near \u03b2i = 0.47 and 0.53. These bands are shown in Fig. 3. This indicates, that the phase B is stable also for 1/\u03c4 = 0.\nThere are also two other fixed points, one withR1 = 0 and another withR2 = 0. For the latter, R1 = m/(\u03b21(p\u2212mb)), and C = r(1\u2212\u03b111R1)(1+b\u03b21R1)/(p\u03b21). Here the analysis of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian shows that a stable area for R2 = 0 appears in the range approximately 0.08 < \u03b21 < 0.46, both for \u03b111 = 0.85 and 0.95.\nThe results for infinite \u03c4 indicate that the fixed points are not isolated, but form a kind of bands. When for finite \u03c4 the evolution of \u03b2i is enabled, small variations of the related variables are observed in phase B, whereas in phase G the solution is a stable fixed point."
