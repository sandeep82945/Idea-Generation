The variation trends of T1 (longitudinal relaxation time), T2 (transverse relaxation time) and BMD (bone mineral density) with the increase of age, and the correlation of T1 and T2 with BMD were examined by establishing a clinical mathematical model.\nResults With the increase of age, BMD and T1 value decreased gradually, while T2 value increased. T1 and T2 had statistical significance in diagnosing OP (P < 0.001), and there is moderate positive correlation between T1 and BMD values (R = 0.636, P < 0.001), while moderate negative correlation between T2 and BMD values (R=-0.694, P < 0.001). Receiver characteristic curve test showed that T1 and T2 had high accuracy in diagnosing OP (T1 AUC = 0.982, T2 AUC = 0.978), and the critical values of T1 and T2 for evaluating osteoporosis were 0.625s and 0.095s, respectively. Besides, the combined utilization of T1 and T2 had higher diagnostic efficiency (AUC = 0.985). Combined T1 and T2 had higher diagnostic efficiency (AUC = 0.985). Function fitting results of OP group: BMD=-0.0037* age \u2212 0.0015*T1 + 0.0037*T2 + 0.86, sum of squared error (SSE) = 0.0392, and non-OP group: BMD = 0.0024* age \u2212 0.0071*T1 + 0.0007*T2 + 1.41, SSE = 0.1007.\nConclusion T1 and T2 value of MAGiC have high efficiency in diagnosing OP by establishing a function fitting formula of BMD with T1, T2 and age."

            "text": "Osteoporosis (OP) is a common systemic metabolic disease characterized by decreased bone mineral density (BMD), structural deterioration of bone tissue, and increased fat fraction (FF) in bone marrow, which leads to bone fragility and increased risk of bone fracture [1, 2]. The incidence of OP in China has ranked first in the world, and its prevalence increases with age [3]. OP has become one of the most common causes of fracture in the middle-aged and elderly, especially in women, bringing a heavy burden to the family and society. In order to assess bone quality and diagnose OP or osteopenia in its early phase, radiologic assessments are often ordered for making decisions regarding the appropriate therapeutic measures. Currently, the radiologic diagnosis of OP mainly includes dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [4], quantitative computed tomography (QCT) [5, 6], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine. In consideration of radiation damage of DXA and QCT, advanced MRI technologies are more and more applied on the early diagnosis of OP in recent studies [7\u20139].\nMRI has the advantages of radiation free and high soft tissue contrast. Compared with X-ray and CT, early changes of bone marrow such as edema can be sensitively detected by MRI. In addition, MRI has unique advantages in displaying subtle fractures, and distinguishing bone tumor and infection. Direct measurement of conventional MRI signal intensity alone cannot reflect the characteristic changes in composition of the bone marrow. Recent studies of the evaluation of bone marrow fat content by MRI fat measurement sequence suggested that OP could be evaluated by conventional lipid suppression technology of short TI inversion recovery (STIR), iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares (IDEAL), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), etc. However, due to small clinical study population, and lack of correlations between MRI quantitative parameters and BMD, the above techniques fail to provide direct BMD values and clinical diagnosis of OP. Magnetic resonance image compilation (MAGiC) is a new quantitative scanning technology based on the principle of multiple-delay multiple-echo (MDME) sequences. In the meantime, four 120\u00b0 saturation pulses were applied in different TR time and double echo acquisition was carried out. Ten contrast weighted images and five quantitative relaxation images were obtained by combining two TE and four TI at one time. In addition to obtaining conventional contrast images, MAGiC can also be applied to reconstruct phase sensitive inversion recover (PSIR), double\ninversion recovery-white matter or Grey matter (DIRWM/GM), which provides high diagnostic value for multiple sclerosis [10\u201312], facial hemangioma syndrome [13, 14] and other lesions.\nMAGiC can quantitatively measure intrinsic properties of tissues based on longitudinal relaxation time (T1), transverse relaxation time (T2) and proton density (PD) parameters. Accurate quantification of T1 and T2 values is important in quantitative MRI technology. Although the relaxation characteristics of tissue are basically stable under the condition of fixed magnetic field, interference within sequences is often noticed in weighted images obtained from conventional MRI sequences. Therefore, direct measurement of the signal intensity value doesn\u2019t reflect the actual characteristics of tissues. In contrast, quantitative MRI technology such as MAGiC sequence simultaneously obtain quantitative maps of T1 and T2 to achieve quantification of tissue characteristics, and changes in T1 and T2 values are related to tissue changes, providing a basis for morphological diagnosis to quantitative diagnosis [15].\nCurrently, MRI MAGiC sequence is mostly clinically applied in the diagnosis of soft tissue diseases, while few studies investigated the potential of MRI MAGiC sequence in musculoskeletal disorder, especially OP diagnosis [16\u201319]. The present study aims to provide a safe and effective strategy for OP diagnosis and screening by comparing and analyzing the trend of MAGiC quantitative parameters and BMD in middle-aged and elderly women."

Among these techniques, MRI has attracted more and more attention in OP research due to its nonradiation property, high tissue contrast, and sensitivity to early changes in bone tissue. However, conventional MRI signals are often interfered, and lack of unified quantitative standard. Direct measurement of signal intensity itself provides little information on tissue structural changes.\nCurrently, most MR techniques for quantitative evaluation of OP mainly focus on fat content, including spectral imaging, water-lipid separation imaging, and magnetic resonance fat suppression [21\u201324]. However, certain controversies exist in the detection results of quantitative fat evaluation of OP due to the uneven distribution of transformed yellow bone marrow, and other uncertainty of changes in the proportion of bone component [25, 26]. Yeung et al. [27] reported that vertebral body fat fraction in OP group was significantly higher than that in normal BMD population, mainly due to the increase of saturated fatty acids, and BMD was positively correlated with unsaturated fatty acids. However, Griffith et al. [26] found that there was no significant difference in the composition and content of bone marrow fatty acids in different BMD groups, and the relative content remained unchanged with age. On this basis, there is an urgent\nneed for a new quantitative magnetic resonance technology to reflect structural alternation in bone tissue for OP diagnosis.\nAs a novel MR quantitative technology, MAGiC quantifies the relaxation time and proton density through multi-echo acquisition saturation recovery, and automatically reconstructs contrast and quantitative relaxation rate maps through post-processing. In addition, MAGiC is able to reconstruct tissue contrast images of any required TR, TE and TI parameters through postparameter setting. During the scanning process, the small rotation pulses used in the previous RF excitation are replaced with 90\u00b0 pulses and a series of 180\u00b0 reunion pulses, which are combined to generate a series of spin echoes rather than gradient echoes to avoid magnetic field inhomogeneity and magneto-sensitive effect. Previous study [28] suggested that the overall quality, anatomical morphology, and ability of lesion detection in MAGiC images were comparable with those of conventional sequences. However, in this study, although voluntary movement was absence in the process of inspection, and the respiratory motion artifact was attenuated by saturated zone, and the reconstruction of the MAGiC figure displayed impaired signal-to-noise ratio at L1 and L5 vertebral bodies. Even though the image quality of MAGiC is not ideal, the efficacy for disease diagnosis of MAGiC has been verified by multi-center and repeatability studies [28\u201330]. In addition, compared with traditional T1 and T2 acquisition, MAGiC achieves T1 and T2 acquisition at the same time, with a much shorter scanning time, which might reduce motion artifacts, and increase patient cooperation during examination [13]."

            "text": "In an early study, Dooms et al. declared that T1 and T2 value were both negatively correlated with age, as the fat content increased and water content decreased in the vertebra [31]. However, they also mentioned that in postmenopause OP, the weakened magnetization effect at the interface between bone marrow and bone trabeculae could prolong T2 relaxation time. Now, T1 and T2 values were considered to lay different emphasis on spinal anatomy. Standardized measurement of the spine showed that T1 value was more affected by vertebral body alternation, while T2 value was correlated with structural changes in spinal cord and intervertebral disc [11]. Teng Hsiang-Ling et al. demonstrated that T2 value was more sensitive and positively correlated to the water content of bone tissue [32]. In the current study, lumbar T1 value was negatively correlated with age (R=-0.706, P < 0.001), which might be explained by the transformation of bone marrow from red to yellow in vertebral body [33, 34]. Since bone marrow transformation in vertebrae is focal and inhomogeneity [14], we outlined the maximum range of vertebrae during measurement to increase the accuracy of measurement. In contrast to T1 value, T2 value of the vertebral body had the same trend with age (R = 0.797, P < 0.001), suggesting increased bone absorption and free water (long T2) that theoretically increased in OP bone trabecula.\nThe accuracy of the two values in the diagnosis of OP was relatively high: T1 sensitivity was 92.86% with 100% specificity, T2 sensitivity was 92.86% with 96.30% specificity, suggesting that when T1 \u2264 0.625s or T2 > 0.095s in lumbar spine of women over 50 years old, the MRI findings are consistent with OP manifestations. However, it is important to notice that the overall accuracy (AUC 0.985) of combined T1 and T2 in diagnosing OP was higher than that of T1 (AUC 0.982) or T2 (AUC 0.978) alone, while the sensitivity (91.07%) was lower. Multiple linear regression might be necessary to screen optimal parameters for OP diagnosis. To obtain the function formula between OP and none-OP groups, ridge regression with more practical and reliable regression coefficients in solving the problem of collinearity of independent variables in linear regression analysis was applied. According to the formula, the non-op value of SSEOP was smaller than that of SSEnon-op, and the range of verified data was 5%. It was considered that the function fitted by OP group was closer to the actual situation, and the corresponding BMD value could be directly calculated by female age and measurement of T1 and T2. Since traditional diagnosis of OP by DXA might not reflect the biomechanical properties of bone such as strength and viscoelasticity, which are closely related to bone water and organic matter and contribute to the mechanical strength of bone tissue [15]. MAGiC sequence might compensate these shortcomings of traditional detection."
