Exploration of Kex2 Protease Cleavage Site Variability Across Different Expression Systems: This study could investigate the impact of varying the cleavage site of Kex2 protease not only in Pichia pastoris but also in other yeast and fungal expression systems. By comparing the efficiency of protein secretion and yield across different organisms, researchers could develop a more universal strategy for optimizing protein production in biotechnological applications.

Structural and Functional Analysis of FNZ in Complex with Bacterial Membranes: A deeper understanding of how FNZ interacts with bacterial cell membranes, especially its binding mechanism and the role of its hydrophobic Phe residue at the P1’ site, could reveal new insights into antimicrobial action. This could involve molecular dynamics simulations, electron microscopy, and surface plasmon resonance to detail the interaction between FNZ and lipid II or other bacterial membrane components.

Development of FNZ Derivatives with Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Activity: While FNZ shows strong activity against Gram-positive bacteria, extending its spectrum to include Gram-negative pathogens would be valuable. Research could focus on modifying FNZ to enhance its permeability and binding to Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes, potentially by incorporating features that target specific vulnerabilities of these bacteria.

In Vivo Efficacy and Safety Studies of FNZ: Before considering clinical applications, it’s crucial to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of FNZ in animal models. Studies could focus on models of infection by S. aureus and other relevant pathogens, evaluating dose-response, toxicity, immune response, and potential for resistance development compared to traditional antibiotics.

Synergistic Effects of FNZ with Other Antimicrobials: The paper hints at FNZ’s potential for synergy with existing antibiotics. Future research could systematically explore combinations of FNZ with a wide range of antibiotics, antifungals, and even non-traditional antimicrobial agents like nanoparticles or bacteriophages. This would involve determining the mechanisms of synergy and identifying optimal combinations for treating resistant infections.
