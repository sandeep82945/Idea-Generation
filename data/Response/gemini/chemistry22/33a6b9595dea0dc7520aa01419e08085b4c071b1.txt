1. **Investigate the cross-talk between different CysPTM types.** The paper mentions that different CysPTM types can competitively co-occupy the same position and form cross-talks. Future research could explore the mechanisms and consequences of these cross-talks. For example, researchers could investigate how the presence of one CysPTM type affects the modification of another CysPTM type at the same site. They could also study how cross-talks between CysPTM types affect protein function and signaling pathways.


2. **Develop new methods for identifying and quantifying CysPTM sites.** The paper highlights the challenges of identifying and quantifying CysPTM sites due to their low abundance and dynamic changes. Future research could focus on developing new methods to overcome these challenges. For instance, researchers could explore the use of advanced mass spectrometry techniques or develop new chemical probes that specifically target and label CysPTM sites.


3. **Study the role of CysPTMs in disease.** The paper briefly mentions that CysPTMs are associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Future research could investigate the specific roles of CysPTMs in these diseases. Researchers could examine how CysPTMs contribute to disease progression and identify potential therapeutic targets. For example, they could study how CysPTMs affect protein function and signaling pathways in cancer cells or how they contribute to the formation of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases.


4. **Explore the potential of CysPTMs as biomarkers.** The paper suggests that CysPTMs could be used as biomarkers for various diseases. Future research could investigate the potential of CysPTMs as diagnostic or prognostic markers. Researchers could examine whether CysPTM levels are altered in patients with specific diseases and whether these changes correlate with disease severity or treatment response. They could also explore the use of CysPTMs to monitor disease progression or response to therapy.


5. **Investigate the role of CysPTMs in cellular signaling.** The paper mentions that CysPTMs can regulate protein structure and function. Future research could explore the role of CysPTMs in cellular signaling pathways. Researchers could investigate how CysPTMs affect protein-protein interactions, enzyme activity, or the localization of proteins within cells. They could also study how CysPTMs contribute to the regulation of specific signaling pathways and how these pathways are involved in various cellular processes.
