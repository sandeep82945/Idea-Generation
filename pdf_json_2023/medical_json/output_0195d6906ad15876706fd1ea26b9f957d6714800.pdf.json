Here we use adult zebrafish to link the molecular diversity of motoneurons (MNs) and the rhythm-generating V2a interneurons (INs) with the modular circuit organization that is responsible for changes in locomotor speed. We show that the molecular diversity of MNs and V2a INs reflects their functional segregation into slow, intermediate or fast subtypes. Furthermore, we reveal shared molecular signatures between V2a INs and MNs of the three speed circuit modules. Overall, by characterizing how the molecular diversity of MNs and V2a INs relates to their function, connectivity and behavior, our study provides important insights not only into the molecular mechanisms for neuronal and circuit diversity for locomotor flexibility but also for charting circuits for motor actions in general.\nA fundamental hallmark of motor actions is the flexibility of the timing, speed and strength that is central to rapid adaptation to the ever-changing world around us. This is particularly apparent during locomotion\u2014a behavior that involves full-body coordination characterized by sudden changes in speed and strength1\u201312. Important insights into the organization of locomotor circuits have been gained by identifying the broadly defined neuronal populations that control distinct features of locomotion (rhythm, pattern, gait)3,6,7,10,13\u201317.\nStudies in zebrafish and mice have revealed a modular organization of the locomotor network with dedicated circuits engaged at slow or fast locomotor speeds5,7,10,15,18\u201325. In these circuits, motoneurons (MNs) are the final processing stage that transforms centrally generated locomotor programs into sequences of muscle activity along the body. Whereas the heterogeneity of MNs has long been appreciated, it is only recently that transcriptional profiling has begun to reveal markers for different MN subtypes26\u201330. The flexibility of locomotor movements emerges from the precise organization of the underlying\ncircuit, particularly how excitatory interneurons (INs) drive the different MN subtypes. Electrophysiological analysis in adult zebrafish has revealed that rhythm-generating excitatory V2a INs and MNs that are recruited together are also connected to each other to form three circuit modules engaged in a speed-dependent manner18,19,23,24,31\u201333. However, how their diversity and circuit modularity is imprinted in their molecular makeup remains unclear. Addressing this question will provide key insights into the logic of neuronal diversity and the formation of functional ensembles for flexible behavior.\nBy leveraging the detailed circuit knowledge in adult zebrafish combined with experimental and genetic accessibility, we assessed the link between the molecular and functional features defining the MN and V2a IN subtypes and their modular circuit organization. We uncover the molecular principles governing the diversity of MNs and V2a INs into three connected functional subtypes. In addition, we reveal the molecular logic that underpins their organization into circuit modules that control locomotor speed.\nReceived: 28 February 2023\nAccepted: 2 October 2023"

These marker genes were not present in the ventromedial aspect, where slow and intermediate MNs are located (Fig. 2i,k,l). The fast MN identity of MN3 was further validated by the expression of calb1, which represents another highly expressed gene in this cluster (Fig. 2m,n and Extended Data Fig. 4g\u2013i). Combinatorial expression analysis for these genes shows minimal overlap between MN1 and MN2 markers and those of MN3 markers, clearly defining the slow\u2013intermediate MNs and the fast MNs, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4a\u2013i).\nWhereas MN3 could be identified as representing fast MN identity, clusters MN1 and MN2 exhibited overlapping gene expression. Nevertheless, these two clusters displayed differential expression levels of specific genes. In particular, the marker gene pvalb6 showed higher expression in MN2 compared with MN1 (Fig. 2m). The MNs with the highest expression of grin1b were located primarily laterally, where slow MNs are typically found, whereas those with the highest expression of pvalb6 were situated mainly medially, corresponding to intermediate MNs (Fig. 2n\u2013p). Another gene, esrrga, also exhibited higher expression in MN1 than in MN2 (Fig. 3a,b). RNAscope in situ hybridization analysis showed a pronounced enrichment of esrrga in MNs located in the lateral part of the spinal cord (Fig. 3a,c). Additionally, the expression of esrrga and grin1b was significantly higher in slow MNs compared with intermediate MNs, whereas pvalb6 and calb1 expression was significantly higher in intermediate MNs (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that MN1 and MN2 share overlapping gene markers. However, these clusters could be associated with slow or intermediate MNs based on their lateromedial location in the spinal cord combined with their level of expression of specific genes.\nTo determine the functional identity of Esrrga+ MNs, we used a transgenic line in which the expression of a fluorescent reporter was driven by esrrga. The different MN subtypes were labeled retrogradely in this line and fluorescence was used as a proxy for the level of expression of esrrga (Fig. 3e). MNs with the highest expression of esrrga were located primarily in the ventrolateral aspect of the spinal cord, consistent with the typical location of slow MNs (Fig. 3e). Subsequently, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from Esrrga+ MNs to validate their functional identity. Most of the recorded Esrrga+ MNs fired in bursts of action potentials (Fig. 3f,g)\u2014a characteristic feature of slow MNs in adult zebrafish31,32. Importantly, none of the recorded Esrrga+ MNs displayed an adapting firing pattern, which is known to be restricted to fast MNs in adult zebrafish (Fig. 3g). To further confirm the slow MN identity of Esrrga+ MNs, we determined their recruitment frequency during swimming and showed that almost all the recorded Esrrga+ MNs were recruited at slow swim frequencies (<3 Hz; Fig. 3h,i).\nTo assess the importance of transcription factors (TFs) in defining the diversity of the MN subtypes, we clustered these MNs using exclusively the expression of TF genes. The resulting clusters (referred to as MN-t clusters) showed a striking correspondence with the clusters obtained from the whole transcriptome analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5). More specifically, the MN population comprised three TF-defined clusters, where MN1 and MN2 became merged into a single cluster MN-t1, while the clusters corresponding to fast (MN-t2) and caudal (MN-t3) MNs remained separated (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Each of these clusters was enriched with a selective set of TFs (Extended Data Fig. 5b). We next performed regulon analysis followed by GO to determine whether specific TFs play a regulatory role for slow\u2013intermediate (MN-t1) and fast (MN-t2) MN clusters. This analysis revealed selective regulons comprising specific key TFs for each of the clusters (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). One of the top-scoring regulons in the slow\u2013intermediate cluster MN-t1 was esrrga, which interacted with a large network of predicted target genes (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Fast cluster MN-t2 was enriched in different regulons, and among the top ones was ebf1b, which forms a network with other predicted TF genes, including neurod1 (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d)."

            "text": "The molecular diversity of MNs was examined using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in 7-week-old zebrafish of the transgenic line Tg(isl1a:GFP)34. This line captured ~80% of each of the three axial MN subtypes (slow, intermediate and fast; Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c). Spinal cords from this line were dissected and dissociated, and green fluorescent protein positive (GFP+) cells were collected individually by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and sequenced using the Smart-seq2 protocol (Extended Data Fig. 1d)35,36. A total of 606 isl1a+ neurons passed quality control and were used for cluster analysis. Transcriptomic analysis of isl1a+ cells revealed eight distinct clusters, each with selective expression of genetic markers (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Whereas all clusters expressed neuronal markers (Extended Data Fig. 2c), only four clusters showed high levels of marker genes for MN identity such as mnx1, slc18a3a (also known as vachta) and chata (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Two of the non-MN clusters expressed markers for cerebrospinal-fluid-contacting neurons (Extended Data Fig. 2e). The other two clusters expressed glutamatergic and serotonergic markers, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 2f,g). Only neurons expressing MN markers were used for subsequent analysis.\nThe identified MNs were reanalyzed, resulting in five clusters (Fig. 1a,b), of which cluster MN5 displayed distinct characteristics of immature neurons. The immature nature of this cluster was supported by the higher expression of markers for MN progenitor (olig2, nkx6.1), MN differentiation (isl1, neurod4, nfia) and neuronal development markers (Fig. 1c,e). In addition, this cluster lacked the marker for peripheral innervation prph and expressed lower levels of moto neuronal transmitter markers (vachta and chata) (Fig. 1c). This cluster was also enriched with genes related to MN development and less enriched with genes related to electrical and synaptic activity (Fig. 1d).\nThe remaining four clusters displayed characteristic features of mature MNs, including cholinergic transmitter and peripheral innervation markers (Fig. 1c). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that clusters MN1 and MN2, but not MN3, were enriched with genes related to high metabolic activity associated with sustaining firing pattern usually found in slow MNs (Fig. 1d). To determine whether these clusters correspond to functional MN subtypes, we examined their expression of known marker genes of slow and fast MNs. Cluster MN1 was differentially enriched with a marker gene of slow MN in zebrafish, pcdh9 (ref. 37), while a marker for slow MNs in mammals, sv2a, was not differentially expressed in any of the clusters (Fig. 1f)38. In contrast, marker genes of fast MNs in mammals, calca and cdh6, were selectively enriched in cluster MN3 (Fig. 1g)\n27,39,40. On the other hand, cluster MN4 was characterized by the selective overexpression of several hox13 genes (Fig. 1h), which could merely reflect the caudal location of these MNs rather than a specific MN subtype. This was confirmed using RNAscope in situ hybridization analysis, which showed that hoxb13a was indeed expressed only in MNs located in the caudal spinal cord (Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013c). Overall, these results reveal three MN subtypes in adult zebrafish that are defined by marker genes for slow or fast MNs.\nLinking MN molecular diversity and function To determine whether the different clusters correspond to functional MN subtypes, we used RNAscope for specific genes that were highly enriched in each cluster combined with retrograde labeling of slow, intermediate or fast MNs41. These MNs can be identified based on the muscle type they innervate and their soma position in the spinal cord (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Two marker genes, grin1b and pvalb6, that were enriched in clusters MN1 and MN2 were coexpressed in MNs located in the ventrolateral aspect of the spinal cord (Fig. 2a\u2013c,e,f). These MNs were identified as slow or intermediate, but not as fast MNs, based on the muscle they innervated and their soma size and position (Fig. 2d\u2013f and Extended Data Fig. 1a). In contrast, two of the marker genes enriched in cluster MN3, chrna2b\nNature Neuroscience | Volume 27 | January 2024 | 78\u201389 80\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-023-01479-1\nThese results show that the different functional MN subtypes can be captured molecularly based on their gene expression profile and validated electrophysiologically. While fast MNs are clearly separated from slow\u2013intermediate MNs based on their TF and their overall gene expression, the assignment of slow versus intermediate identity is not recapitulated by TFs alone and becomes apparent based on the expression levels of specific genes."

This analysis resulted in four clusters (V2a-t1\u20134) (Extended Data Fig. 6a). V2a-t1 and V2a-t2 showed striking correspondence with the original clusters V2a1 and V2a2, respectively. However, the original V2a3 split into two closely related clusters, V2a-t3 and V2a-t4. Each cluster was defined by overexpression of several specific TFs (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Furthermore, regulon analysis identified cluster specific regulons with key TFs interacting with different target genes related to neuronal function, connectivity and transcription (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). The slow and intermediate clusters V2a-t1 and V2a-t2 had different top-scoring regulons that interacted with different TFs, channel and receptor genes (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). The top regulons of the fast clusters V2a-t3 and V2a-t4, ebf1a and neurod1, form a network with other predicted TF genes, including vachta (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). Interestingly, the two top regulons of fast V2a INs are shared with the fast MN cluster MN-t2.\nOverall, these results show that the diversity of V2a INs can be revealed by the differential expression of TFs alone with three main clusters defined by selective marker genes (esrrga, shox2 or vachta).\nV2a IN clusters represent functional subtypes To examine whether the molecularly defined V2a IN clusters represent different functional subtypes within the spinal locomotor circuits, we performed electrophysiological analysis. We used transgenic lines in which a fluorescent reporter (GFP or red fluorescent protein (RFP)) expression is driven by esrrga, shox2 or vachta that were crossed either with Tg(chx10:RFP) or Tg(chx10:GFP). The Esrrga+ V2a INs were restricted mostly to cluster V2a1 (Fig. 5a,b) and most of them displayed pacemaker properties and fired in bursts of action potentials in response to depolarizing current injections (Fig. 5c,j). These Esrrga+ V2a INs were of small size and displayed only unidirectional descending axonal projections in the lateral aspect of the spinal cord (Extended Data Fig. 7a,d\u2013f). The Shox2+ V2a INs were confined to cluster V2a2 (Fig. 5d,e) and fired mostly tonically when they were depolarized with current injections (Fig. 5f,j). These V2a INs also had small soma size but displayed bidirectional axonal projections with a longer descending and shorter ascending projection also running in the lateral aspect of the spinal cord (Extended Data Fig. 7b,d\u2013f). The vAChTa+ V2a INs were restricted to cluster V2a3 (Fig. 5g,h), were characterized by a strong adaptation and fired mostly at the beginning of the current injection (Fig. 5i,j). These V2a INs had a large soma size and always displayed long bidirectional axonal projections with a main descending axon running medially in the spinal cord that gave rise to an ascending collateral projection (Extended Data Fig. 7c\u2013f). In addition, previously described local cholinergic V2a INs embedded in the escape circuit (esV2a)44 were also captured in the vAChTa+ V2a IN population (Extended Data Fig. 7c).\nIn addition to differences in their firing properties and morphology, these three V2a INs subtypes defined by molecular clustering also displayed clear differences in their excitability. The most excitable were the Esrrga+ V2a INs (cluster V2a1), which had the lowest firing threshold, highest input resistance and smallest afterhyperpolarization (AHP; Fig. 5k\u2013m). The Shox2+ V2a INs (cluster V2a2) were also characterized by high excitability, albeit to a lesser extent than the Esrrga+ neurons (Fig. 5k\u2013m). In contrast, the vAChTa+ V2a INs (cluster V2a3) were the least excitable and had the highest firing threshold, lowest input resistance and largest AHP (Fig. 5k\u2013m).\nThe difference in excitability of the three V2a IN subtypes mirrored the sequential order of their recruitment with increasing swimming speeds. Most of the Esrrga+ V2a INs were recruited at the slowest swim frequencies (<4 Hz) and maintained their recruitment as the speed increased (Fig. 5n). The Shox2+ V2a INs were recruited mostly at intermediate swim speeds (4\u20137 Hz) (Fig. 5n). vAChTa+ correspond to fast V2a INs as they were never recruited at slow or intermediate frequencies up to 7 Hz (Fig. 5n), and they become recruited at higher frequencies (>7\u20138 Hz) (Extended Data Fig. 7g)18. The preferential speed-dependent recruitment of the three V2a INs subtypes (slow, intermediate and\nfast) (Fig. 5o) matched the expression levels of their selective marker genes of the three transcriptionally defined V2a IN clusters (V2a1\u20133) (Fig. 5p). RNAscope analysis of esrrga, shox2 and vachta in Tg(chx10:GFP) revealed that the soma of V2a INs of the three clusters did not show any preferential position as they were intermingled in the spinal cord (Fig. 5q). These results show a tight correspondence between the anatomical, electrophysiological and functional properties of V2a IN subtypes18,19,23,24 and their distinct molecular profiles. Slow V2a INs comprise cluster V2a1, intermediate comprise cluster V2a2 and fast V2a INs comprise cluster V2a3."

            "text": "To determine whether the transcriptional differentiation of MNs and V2a INs is established early during development, we analyzed available scRNA-seq data from 4 days postfertilization larvae45. Larval MN segregated into six clusters (MN-l1\u20136) (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Two of these clusters expressed known markers of either slow (MN-l1) or fast (MN-l2) MNs, whereas the other four clusters (MN-l3-6) expressed a marker of fin MNs, foxp1b (ref. 46) (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Larval MN-l1 was highly enriched in gene markers of adult MN clusters (MN1 and MN2; esrrga, grin1b, pvalb6) corresponding to slow\u2013intermediate MNs (Extended Data Fig. 8c), whereas larval MN-l2 was enriched in gene markers specific to the adult fast MN cluster (MN3; chrna2b, neurod1, ebf3a) (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Similarly, this analysis revealed three larval V2a IN clusters (V2a-l1\u20133) (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Each of these clusters was selectively enriched in adult gene markers of either slow (V2a1; esrrga, sp8a), intermediate (V2a2; shox2, zfhx3b) or fast (V2a3; vachta, ebf1a) V2a INs (Extended Data Fig. 8f\u2013h). These results suggest that, early during development, MNs are differentiated into two main molecularly defined subtypes, whereas V2a INs are already segregated into three molecularly distinct subtypes.\nMolecular underpinnings of circuit modules V2a INs and MNs are known to be connected in a specific organization to form three circuit modules that drive locomotion at slow, intermediate and fast speeds18,24. However, it is not known whether each of these circuit modules has a common molecular signature. To address this question, we first analyzed the integrated MN and V2a IN transcriptome, which allows the identification of shared molecular features among the two neuronal populations47. The integrated dataset revealed a distinct pattern with the MN and V2a IN clusters belonging to the same speed module being located in close proximity in the transcriptomic space (Fig. 6a). All the clusters comprising the slow and intermediate speed modules across both populations occupied the left half of the transcriptome map (Fig. 6a). The fast MN cluster together with fast V2a INs, and the immature neurons of both neuronal populations occupied the right half of the map (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, there were several genetic markers for the slow/intermediate or fast module that were enriched both in MN and V2a IN datasets (Fig. 6b). These include TFs (esrrga, neurod1, nfixa, nfixb); genes that regulate neuronal physiology (oxr1a, oxr1b; oxidation resistance genes for the metabolically active slow module); and cell adhesion molecules that could be important in the establishment and maintenance of the proper neuronal connectivity (csmd2, pcdh17, ncs1a, c1qtnf4).\nTo determine whether the differentially expressed genes in each of the V2a IN and MN clusters capture their modular circuit identity, we compared the gene expression profiles of each functional cluster of the two separate datasets. Analysis of the overall differentially expressed gene set and TFs showed a clear correspondence between V2a IN and MN clusters belonging to the same speed module, with some overlap between slow and intermediate clusters (Fig. 6c). A similar analysis was performed on V2a INs and MNs that were clustered exclusively by their TF expression (Extended Data Figs. 5a,b and 6a,b). This analysis also showed a clear correspondence between TF-defined V2a IN and MN clusters according to their respective speed module (Extended Data\nNature Neuroscience | Volume 27 | January 2024 | 78\u201389 85\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-023-01479-1\nBursting Tonic Adapting\nn\nEs rr\nga + V 2a Sh ox 2+ V 2a\nvA C\nhT a+\nV 2a\nSlow swim (2\u20133 Hz) Intermediate swim (5\u20136 Hz)\n10 mV 200 ms\n0\n10\n20\n30\nV2a1\nG en\ne ex\npr es\nsi on\n(n or\nm al\niz ed\n)\n10 mV 200 ms\n10 mV 200 ms\no\nesrrga shox2 vachta\np\nb\n20 \u00b5m\nV2a INs Esrrga+\nD\nC\na\n0\n2\n4\n6\nUMAP1\nesrrga\nV2a2\nV2a1\nV2a4\nV2a3\n\u201355 mV\n\u201361 mV\n20 mV\n100 ms\n20 \u00b5m\nV2a INs Shox2+ e\nD\nC\n0\n2\n4\n6shox2 d\nUMAP1\nU M\nAP 2\nU M\nAP 2\nh\nV2a INs vAChTa+\nD\nC\ng\nvachta\n0\n2\n4\n6\nUMAP1\nU M\nAP 2\n\u201352 mV\n\u201366 mV\n\u201362 mV\n\u201367 mV\n20 mV\n100 ms\n20 mV\n100 ms\n\u201350\n\u201340\n\u201330\n\u201320\n\u201310\n0\nTh re\nsh ol\nd (m\nV)\n****\n*** ****\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nRe si\nst an\nce (G\n)\n**** ****\nAH P\n(m V)\n\u201310\n0\n10\n20\n30 **** ****\n****\nvA Ch\nTa +\nSh ox\n2 +\nEs rrg\na +\nPe rc\nen ta\nge o\nf n eu\nro ns\n0\n80\n60\n40\n20\n100 c\nf\ni\nj\nk\nl\nm\nV2a2 V2a3\n\u201351.4 mV\n\u201363.6 mV\n\u201358.8 mV 0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nEsrrga+ Shox2+ vAChTa+\nS I F\nPe rc\nen ta\nge o\nf n eu\nro ns\nEs rr\nga M\ner ge\nV2 a\nSh ox\n2 M\ner ge\nV2 a\nvA C\nhT a\nM er ge V2 a\nq\n20 \u00b5m\n20 \u00b5m\n20 \u00b5m 20 \u00b5m\nV2a2\nV2a1\nV2a4\nV2a3\nV2a2\nV2a1\nV2a4\nV2a3\nvA Ch\nTa +\nSh ox\n2 +\nEs rrg\na +\nvA Ch\nTa +\nSh ox\n2 +\nEs rrg\na +\nvA Ch\nTa +\nSh ox\n2 +\nEs rrg\na +\nFig. 5 | Electrophysiological and functional validation of V2a IN molecular clusters. a, UMAP of log-normalized expression of esrrga in V2a IN clusters. b, Expression of Essrga and Chx10 in a spinal segment. c, Examples of bursting (top) or tonic (bottom) firing Esrrga+ V2a INs. d, UMAP log-normalized expression of shox2 in V2a IN clusters. e, Expression of Shox2 and Chx10 in a spinal segment. f, Examples of tonic firing Shox2+ V2a INs. g, UMAP log-normalized expression of vachta in V2a IN clusters. h, Expression of vAChTa and Chx10 in a spinal segment. i, Examples of adapting firing vAChTa+ V2a INs. j, Percentage of Esrrga+, Shox2+ or vAChTa+ V2a INs with bursting, tonic or adapting firing (n = 43 Esrrga+, n = 53 Shox2+; n = 28 vAChTa+ V2a INs). k, Firing threshold of the three V2a INs subtypes (one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc multiple comparisons, ***P = 0.0009 ****P < 0.0001; n = 23 vAChTa+; 28 Shox2+; 32 Esrrga+ V2a INs). l, Input resistance of the three V2a INs subtypes\n(Kruskal\u2013Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s post hoc multiple comparisons, ****P < 0.0001; n = 44 vAChTa+; n = 47 Shox2+; n = 47 Esrrga+ V2a INs). m, AHP amplitude of the three V2a INs subtypes (one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc multiple comparisons, ****P < 0.0001; n = 23 vAChTa+; n = 34 Shox2+; n = 30 Esrrga+ V2a INs). n, Top, an Esrrga+ V2a IN recruited at slow and intermediate swim frequencies.

These results show that the three V2a IN-MN speed modules, previously defined electrophysiologically18,19,23,24, are each characterized by common molecular signatures.\nNext, we performed dual patch-clamp recordings from V2a INs of each transcriptionally defined cluster and slow, intermediate or fast MNs to examine their functional connectivity. To target V2a INs of each cluster, we used transgenic lines in which the expression of a fluorescent reporter was driven by esrrga, shox2 or vachta, and crossed with chx10 transgenic lines (see above). Retrograde labeling of fluorescent dyes into the respective muscles allowed us to target slow, intermediate and fast MNs. Esrrga+ V2a INs (cluster V2a1) exhibited reliable monosynaptic connections with slow, Esrrga+ MNs (Fig. 7a,c; top). Reconstruction of the connected pairs revealed that the axons of Esrrga+ V2a IN specifically targeted the dendrites of slow MN (Fig. 7b; top). Similarly, Shox2+ V2a INs (cluster V2a2) displayed consistent monosynaptic connections with intermediate MNs through axo-dendritic contacts (Fig. 7a\u2013c; middle). vAChTa+ V2a INs (cluster V2a3) were found to be connected to fast MNs (Fig. 7a, c; bottom). In contrast to slow and intermediate V2a INs, the axon collaterals of fast V2a INs targeted the soma of fast MNs (Fig. 7b; bottom), as described previously23.\nIntegrated data: MNsa Integrated data: V2a INs\nthe gene in a cluster, and the color intensity reflects its average expression level within that cluster. c, Top, Sankey plot of overall differentially expressed genes (left) and differentially expressed TFs (right) shared by different modules of V2a IN and MN clusters.

These results show selective and reliable connections of transcriptionally defined V2a INs with MNs of the corresponding module.\nFinally, to assess the functional impact of transcriptionally defined V2a INs on swimming behavior, we performed loss-of-function experiments combined with behavioral analysis. Ablation of slow, Esrrga+ V2a INs selectively impaired slow explorative swimming, resulting in a shift towards higher speeds (Fig. 7d). Conversely, ablation of fast,\nvAChTa+ V2a INs affected touch-induced fast swimming by decreasing the maximum speed (Fig. 7e). Ablation of slow, Esrrga+ or fast, vAChTa+ V2a INs did not affect sound-induced escape behavior (Fig. 7f)."

These principal classes are heterogenous, and contain a diversity of neuron types, but it has been difficult to capture the importance of this diversity at the functional level. In this study, we used scRNA-seq in adult zebrafish to link the molecular diversity of MNs and V2a INs with the modular circuit organization that is responsible for changes in locomotor speed. We show that each neuronal population comprises three specific subtypes defined by key molecular features and that correspond to neurons underlying locomotion at slow, intermediate and fast speeds. Furthermore, our analysis reveals molecular signatures that define each of the three V2a IN\u2013MN circuit speed modules. This study uncovers the molecular underpinnings of neuronal diversity and how they relate to the function of locomotor circuits in adult zebrafish.\nSeveral key findings emerge from this study. First, three molecularly defined adult MN subtypes emerge that correspond to those innervating slow, intermediate or fast muscles31,32. Second, there was a substantial overlap in transcriptional profiles between slow and intermediate, while fast MNs displayed distinct molecular features. The expression of TF genes alone did not separate slow and intermediate MNs into distinct clusters. These clusters were instead distinguished based on their expression levels of specific genes. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis during larval stages revealed two clusters of axial MNs that were enriched with marker genes for either slow\u2013intermediate or fast adult MNs. This suggests that the segregation between slow and fast MNs occurs early during development. However, the separation of slow and intermediate MNs in the adult may involve experience-dependent plasticity and/or other developmental changes that are related to their circuit connectivity and the maturation of the muscle types they innervate.\nSimilarly, adult V2a INs were also divided into three molecularly distinct subtypes whose functional and morphological features matched those recruited at slow, intermediate or fast swimming speeds. These three V2a IN subtypes were already differentiated at early developmental stages. The diversity of MNs and V2a INs could be captured by their expression of specific TFs, which could have key regulatory roles. Finally, our analysis revealed a molecular logic associating the diversity of V2a INs and MNs to their connectivity into three speed circuits. Our results indicate that key molecular features are shared across classes, and they correlate with their common functional and circuit identity. Thus, conserved elements of connection specificity underlying locomotor circuit modularity correlate with common sets of TFs within V2a INs and MNs. These results suggest that the molecular signature for the modular circuit organization revealed here could represent a principle by which circuits are defined as functional entities, including those driving locomotion in mammals.\nIn mice, recent studies have used transcriptional profiling to show heterogeneity among ventral spinal neuronal classes15\u201317,27\u201330,48\u201352. Considerable diversity was demonstrated within the V2a IN population, with differentially expressed molecular markers reflecting the spatial location, axonal projections and rostrocaudal position along the spinal cord17. Moreover, in some studies in mice, V2a INs were segregated into two to four clusters17,48,50\u201352. Some of the markers (for example, shox2, zfhx3b, neurod2, nfib and esrrga) of the V2a IN clusters revealed in mice are similar to those that we now reveal in V2a INs of adult zebrafish. This further supports the notion that there are conserved molecular markers defining the diversity within the V2a IN population.\nAnalysis of the MN transcriptome in mice has shown that the molecular diversity of MNs relates to different MN pools innervating distinct muscles, rather than distinguishing specific MN subtypes innervating slow versus fast muscle fibers, which are mixed in many of these muscles26,27,29. In zebrafish, the situation is more advantageous with a separate location of slow, intermediate and fast muscle fibers and their respective MNs in the medial motor column. Although, in mice, MN subtypes were not segregated into different clusters, some known marker genes related to slow versus fast were enriched in different neurons within the same cluster27. Recent studies in embryonic\nand larval zebrafish used single-cell RNA profiling to identify molecular signatures for MN subtypes and their specification at early developmental stages28,45. Our study in adult zebrafish reveals that the three subtypes of functionally defined MNs (slow, intermediate and fast) are delineated by distinct molecular features and identified several additional molecular markers for slow, intermediate and fast MNs that could be used to guide studies in mammals.\nOur transcriptomic analysis reveals general circuit principles based on spinal neuron diversity beyond the basic cardinal populations. The neuronal populations that form the locomotor network have been shown to display close or overlapping distributions in the transcriptomic space with overlapping gene expression patterns51. In addition, conserved genetic signatures define the axonal projection pattern among different neuronal classes50 raising the possibility for orthogonal marker modules across neuronal spinal classes. Our study not only links the molecular identity of neuronal types to their function but also uncovers orthogonal transcriptomic rules related to their modular circuit organization controlling locomotion. Thus, characterizing how the molecular diversity of MN and V2a INs relates to their function, connectivity and behavior provides groundtruth insights not only into the circuit mechanisms of locomotor flexibility but also for charting circuits for motor actions in general."

In this study, adult animals 7\u201311 weeks old of either sex were used. All transgenic lines used in this study were obtained from the Higashijima laboratory. The islet-1 transgenic line Tg(isl1a:GFP) (ZFIN: ZDB-TGCONSTRCT-070117-161), in which GFP expression driven by the promoter of isl1a is found in MNs and other INs, was used to sequence the transcriptome of MNs. The vsx2 transgenic line referred to as Tg(chx10:GFP) (ZFIN: ZDB-GENO-010924-10), in which GFP is expressed in V2a INs, was used to sequence the transcriptome of the V2a INs and to perform RNAscope experiments. The AB wild type strain (ZFIN: ZDB-GENO-960809-7) was used to perform RNAscope experiments in which MNs were labeled by dye injections in the muscles. The selective targeting of Esrrga+ V2a INs was obtained by crossing Tg(esrrga-hs:loxP-RFP-loxP-GFP) and Tg(chx10:GFP). The selective targeting of Shox2+ V2a INs was obtained by crossing Tg(shox2:Gal4), Tg(UAS:GFP) and Tg(chx10-loxP-dsRed-loxP-GFP) (referred to as Tg(chx10:RFP), ZFIN: ZDB-TGCONSTRCT-070117-143). The selective targeting of vAChTa+ V2a INs was obtained by crossing Tg(vachta:GFP) and Tg(chx10:RFP).

The spinal cord was dissected quickly in the slush of frozen extracellular solution and collected. Two samples were prepared from the Tg(isl1a:GFP) line, and two samples were prepared from the Tg(chx10:GFP) line. For each sample, six to ten intact isolated spinal cords were incubated in 1 ml of DMEM/F-12 medium (Thermo Fisher, catalog no. 11039021, osmolarity adjusted to 280\u2013290 mOsm) containing papain 10 U ml\u22121 (Worthington Biochemical, catalog no.

The sample was centrifuged at 300g at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min, and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of DMEM/F-12 (280\u2013290 mOsm) after removal of the supernatant. Following mechanical trituration using fire-polished Pasteur pipettes, the cell suspension was filtered through a cell strainer (40 \u03bcm). The sample was kept at room temperature for 20 min after the addition of 0.1 ml of the nuclear DNA stain DRAQ5 (Thermo Fisher, catalog no. 65-0880-92). Using FACS, cells positive for GFP and DRAQ5 in each sample were sorted into a 384-well plate containing a mild hypotonic lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 2 U ml\u22121 RNase inhibitor) and immediately snap-frozen on ice, then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.

The resulting bam files were filtered to keep only uniquely mapped reads. Most of the subsequent analysis was performed in R (v.4.0.5, R Core Team, 2022) using the Seurat package (v.4.0.2)47. Analysis of each dataset was conducted separately. The two samples of the Tg(isl1a:GFP) line dataset were integrated using the IntegrateData (30 dimensions, all genes used) Seurat function to avoid sample bias. In both datasets, we excluded genes that were expressed in fewer than three cells, and cells that had more than 30% reads from mitochondrial genes or from\nspike-ins, or a number of genes higher than 9,000 or lower than 2,000. After this quality control, the Tg(isl1a:GFP) line dataset contained 606 cells and the Tg(chx10:GFP) line dataset contained 593 cells. The gene expression measurements within each cell were scaled by a constant factor then log-normalized (gene counts for each cell are divided by the total counts for that cell and then multiplied by the scale factor) and regressed by the percentage of ribosomal gene content, number of features and feature count using the ScaleData Seurat function. The scale factor used was the average gene count per cell. The 2,000 most variable features identified using the variance-stabilizing transformation method or the TF list obtained using the Prowler of Panther 17.0 (ref. 54) were used for principal component analysis. The top principal components were used for the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) two-dimensional visualization and for graph-based clustering using the FindClusters Seurat function with a resolution of 0.6. The exact number of principal components used was decided based on their s.d. and on random permutation of a subset of data using the JackStraw Seurat function and was generally close to ten principal components. Log-normalized and scaled data were used for violin plots, ball plots and differential expression analysis. Differentially expressed genes in each cluster compared with all clusters were identified using the MAST test implemented in the Seurat function FindMarkers (ref. 55). The genes included in the analysis had a log foldchange of at least 0.25 and the Bonferroni adjusted P value cutoff was set to P < 0.05. The immature MN and V2a clusters (Cluster MN5 and V2a4) have been excluded from the clustering by TFs. GO analysis of all differentially expressed genes per cluster was performed using Panther (v.17.0) overrepresentation test with Fisher\u2019s exact test. For the regulon analysis, all gene names were converted to mouse gene names using the BioMart Ensembl data mining tool. The analysis was performed on all differentially expressed genes in the TF-derived clusters, using the Cytoscape (v.3.2.0) plugin iRegulon (v.1.3)56. Results are ordered by normalized enrichment score. A high normalized enrichment score (>3.0) indicates an RNA binding motif that matches with a large proportion of differentially expressed genes in the analyzed cluster. Subsequently, iRegulon identifies the optimal subset of genes (target genes) that are probably controlled by this motif, and finally associates the motif with the TF (regulator) that is most probably regulating the gene regulatory network associated with that motif. To identify the shared correlation structures between the two datasets in Fig. 6, the package Harmony (v.0.1.0) was used57. The larval data used for the analysis in Extended Data Fig. 8 has GEO accession number GSE232801 and the file used was GSE232801_Neurons. RDS (ref. 45).

The meninges were pierced with dedicated glass pipettes using motorized micromanipulators (SM7, Luigs and Neumann), to access the neurons for electrophysiological recordings. Patch-clamp electrodes were driven to the identified neurons while applying constant positive pressure and whole-cell recordings were performed. Intracellular signals were recorded in current clamp with no bias current and were amplified using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and low pass filtered at 10 kHz. Electrophysiological data were digitized at 10 or 20 kHz using a Digidata 1322A analog-to-digital converter (Molecular Devices) and acquired using pClamp software (v.10; Molecular Devices). Synaptic connectivity between pairs of V2a INs and MNs was examined using dual whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Action potentials were elicited in presynaptic V2a INs with current injections (3 ms pulses) and monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded in postsynaptic MNs. Fictive swimming was elicited by electrical stimulation of descending axons with an extracellular glass pipette that was placed at the junction between the brainstem and the spinal cord19,31,32,59."

For RNAscope analysis, spinal cords were positioned laterally on a microscope glass slide and then mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher, catalog no. P36930). The soma size was measured as the maximum surface area from confocal images. The position of axonal projections was measured from confocal images of two spinal segments away from the soma. The full morphologies (soma, axons and dendrites) of neurobiotin-filled neurons were traced and reconstructed manually in Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc.) on z-stacks of confocal images. For RNAscope analysis, only intact spinal cords in the proper orientation were used. RNAscope puncta were counted manually on z-stacks of confocal images and neurons were classified as positive for the RNA probe if they had at least three puncta at the level of the cell body. Double positive neurons for RNAscope probes were identified if they show at least three puncta of each probe. MNs were identified based on the selective muscle retrogradely injected and their respective positions in the spinal cord. Images were analyzed using ImageJ and the top, bottom, lateral and medial (central canal) coordinates of the spinal cord were used as references to calculate the position of the cell soma.

Field-specific reporting Please select the one below that is the best fit for your research. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection. Life sciences Behavioural & social sciences Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciences For a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf Life sciences study design All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative. Sample size No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in our previous publications (refs 17,22,23,59 in the paper) and based on the 3R principle. Data exclusions In the transcriptomics dataset, we excluded genes that were expressed in less than 3 cells, and cells that had more than 30% reads from mitochondrial genes or from spike-ins, or a number of genes higher than 9000 or lower than 2000. Replication The experiments shown in Fig. 2c,d,i,j were repeated independently in 4 animals for each RNAscope probe combination, with similar results. The experiments shown in Fig. 3a were repeated independently in 8 animals, with similar results. The experiments shown in Fig. 3e were repeated independently in 3 animals, with similar results. The experiments shown in Fig. 5b,e,h were repeated independently in 4 animals for each transgenic line, with similar results. The experiments shown in Extended Data Fig. 4a, 4c, 4e, 4g were repeated independently in 4 animals for each RNAscope probe combination, with similar results. Randomization In ablation experiments, control and ablated fish were tested in randomized order. All samples were randomly allocated into experimental groups. Blinding The investigators were blinded to group allocation during data analysis. During data collection blinding was not relevant given the methodological approach (single-cell RNA sequencing sample preparation, electrophysiological recording) or the experimental design (ablation and behavioral test).
