However, their mutual interference effects have not been elucidated in a quantitative manner thus far. In this paper, we create a mismatch between the two wakes by introducing a size difference in the cylinder pair, such that the effects of one wake on the other can be distinguished. Depending on the size and gap ratios between the two cylinders, the coupled wake exhibits distinct dynamical features including the quasi-periodic flow, synchronized flow, and chaotic flow. Through advanced spectral analysis of lift coefficients and dynamic mode decomposition of the flow fields, we reveal that the quasi-periodic flows are mainly composed of two primary frequencies associated with vortex shedding in the near wakes of the two cylinders. Both wakes impose their own frequencies on the other, resulting in the beating phenomenon in the lift coefficients. The triad interactions between the two wakes generate the sideband frequencies, which are associated with modal structures that are mostly active in the far wake. The transition from quasi-periodicity to synchronization is dominated by the vortex shedding behind the larger cylinder, to which the wake of the smaller cylinder locks in. These results reveal new insights on the coupled wakes of two circular cylinders, and are pivotal for understanding more general wake interaction problems.",

            "text": "Flow over multiple bluff bodies in proximity is a common occurrence in various engineering applications such as high-rise buildings, marine structures, heat exchange tubes, just to name a few. The interactions between multiple wakes give rise to complex flow patterns, which are often associated with substantial flow-induced forces, sound generation, and structural vibrations (Zdravkovich 1997; Sumner 2010; Zhou & Alam 2016). As a prototype of this general flow interference problem, the simplified configuration of flow over two side-by-side cylinders has been investigated extensively. Most of these studies have focused on the case where the two cylinders are the same in size.\nThe wake dynamics of a pair of side-by-side identical cylinders is significantly influenced by the gap distance between the two bodies (Williamson 1985; Peschard & Le Gal 1996; Kang 2003). For cylinders separated with large distance (typically larger than 5 cylinder diameters), the mutual interference between the two wakes is negligible, leading to two separate single-cylinder wakes. As the gap distance is reduced, the two vortex streets become synchronized. With relatively large gap, the wake is characterized by two parallel vortex streets with anti-phase shedding (Bearman & Wadcock 1973; Williamson 1985).\n\u2020 Email address for correspondence: kai.zhang3@rutgers.edu\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n01 07\n2v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. fl\nudy\nn] 4\nJ an\n2 02\n2\nWith smaller gap, the wake transitions to in-phase shedding, and the two vortex streets merge into a \u201cbinary vortex\u201d at downstream (Williamson 1985). The flow between the two cylinders becomes more prominent as the gap further decreases. The wake becomes asymmetric, and is characterized by a deflected gap flow with the formation of a narrow and a wide wake. The gap flow is observed to switch randomly between the two opposite directions, leading to the \u201cflip-flop\u201d phenomenon (Kim & Durbin 1988; Carini et al. 2014). As the two cylinders are brought into contact, a single vortex street forms in the wake, with the characteristic length scale being double the diameter of the cylinder. The transitions between the above different flow states are also found to be associated with bistabilities (Kang 2003; Mizushima & Ino 2008; Ren et al. 2021).\nDespite the vast literature on the flows over two identical cylinders, a deep understanding of how one wake is affected by the other is hindered by the difficulty in differentiating the neighbouring wake\u2019s interference effects from its own wake dynamics, since both have the same frequency. In this study, we break such symmetry by introducing a size difference in the cylinder pair. This creates a scenario where the two wakes with different shedding frequencies and strengths are coupled, such that their mutual interaction effects can be distinguished through spectral analysis. Among the few who have studied a similar problem setup, Inoue & Suzuki (2008) numerically investigated the sound generation by two square cylinders of different sizes placed in a side-by-side arrangement at a low Reynolds number of 150. Octavianty & Asai (2015) further studied the vortex shedding from two side-by-side rectangular cylinders with different cross-sectional aspect ratios of 1.2\u20131.5 at Reynolds number of the order 104. Both works revealed interesting flow phenomenon such as beating and lock-in. However, the discussions in these studies remain qualitative, and a thorough understanding of the wake interference effects is not achieved.\nAiming at providing an improved understanding of this wake interference problem, we carry out a large number of direct numerical simulations of flows over two side-by-side cylinders with difference sizes and gap distances. We quantify the mutual interactions between the parallel wakes by performing spectral analysis and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to the flows, and reveal novel flow physics that can not be observed in the wakes of two identical cylinders. The insights obtained from this study should improve the understanding of more general wake interaction problems. In what follows, we provide details of computational setup in \u00a72. The results are presented in \u00a73. We conclude this study by summarizing our findings in \u00a74."

Two cylinders with diameters D and rD, where r is the nondimensional size ratio, are placed side-by-side to the uniform inflow velocity U\u221e. The gap distance between the two cylinders is denoted as gD, with g being the nondimensional gap ratio. In this study, we consider a range of size ratio r \u2208 [1/1.3, 1.3], and gap ratio g \u2208 [1, 3]. The Reynolds number is defined based on cylinder 1, i.e., ReD \u2261 U\u221eD/\u03bd, and is fixed at 100. In what follows, the spatial variables are normalized by D, velocity by U\u221e, and time by D/U\u221e.\nA finite-volume-based incompressible flow solver pimpleFoam from the OpenFOAM package (Weller et al. 1998) is used for solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with second-order-accuracies in both space and time. The rectangular computational domain covers (x, y) \u2208 [\u221215, 45] \u00d7 [\u221220, 20]. The wake region behind the cylinder pair is discretized with uniform grid. The inlet boundary is prescribed with the freestream velocity (u, v) = (U\u221e, 0), where u and v are the components in the velocity vector u. The surfaces of the cylinders are treated as no-slip (u, v) = (0, 0). The side\nboundaries are considered as slip v = 0. The zero-gradient condition is applied to the outlet for velocity, where a reference pressure p = 0 is specified. The drag, lift coefficients and the Strouhal number are defined based on the diameter of cylinder 1 as\nCd = Fd\n\u03c1U2\u221eD/2 , Cl = Fl \u03c1U2\u221eD/2 , and St = fD U\u221e , (2.1)\nwhere Fd and Fl are the drag and lift force on the cylinder with unit length, \u03c1 is the fluid density, and f is the frequency. These definitions allow a straightforward comparison of the hydrodynamic quantities between two cylinders.\nTo validate the computational setup, we compare the drag, lift coefficients and the Strouhal number of the case (r, g) = (1, 1.5) with previous studies. As shown in table 2,\nthe key hydrodynamic quantities are in good agreement with the data from the literature. It is also seen that the refined mesh does not significantly affect the results. In addition, we compare the key hydrodynamic quantities of flow over a single cylinder with Henderson (1995), Norberg (2003) and Williamson (1996) in figure 2. Again, the results achieve almost perfect match, demonstrating high accuracy of the computational setup."

            "text": "As observed from figure 2, with increasing diameter of the cylinder, the natural vortex shedding frequency decreases, and the strength of the vortex shedding (indicated by Cl,max) increases. In this section, we discuss the behaviors of the coupled wakes with distinct natural frequencies and strengths. We first present a classification of flows based on their wake dynamics over a range of size and gap ratios. The mutual interference effects between the two wakes are then quantified through an advanced spectral analysis of the lift coefficients. At last, we reveal the spatial modes of interaction in the coupled wakes using the technique of dynamic mode decomposition.\n3.1. Classification of the coupled wakes\nDepending on the size and gap ratios, the flows over two side-by-side uneven cylinders exhibit different dynamical features, including quasi-periodicity, synchronization, and chaotic shedding. We present these three typical wakes in figure 3, with their distributions in the r-g space mapped out in figure 4. The quasi-periodic flows are mostly observed for cases with large gap ratios, where the mutual interactions between the two wakes are relatively weak. These flows feature two rows of vortex streets developing separately in\nthe near wakes, as shown in figure 3(a). The shed vortices undergo complex interactions as they are convected further downstream. The lift coefficients of the two cylinders exhibit beating phenomenon, suggesting the existence of multiple frequency components in the flows. This also results in a recurrent but not repetitive trajectory in the phase portrait spanned by Cl,1 and Cl,2.\nDecreasing the gap ratio strengthens the mutual interactions between the two wakes, leading to synchronization of the parallel vortex streets as shown in figure 3(b). The synchronized flow features a C-shaped wake, where the like-sign vortices from the two wakes merge into one larger vortex streets. The lift coefficients of the two cylinders exhibit periodic oscillations with a closed loop in their phase portrait. Different from the quasi-periodic flows where the lift fluctuations of the two cylinders are comparable, in the synchronized flow the lift fluctuation on cylinder 2 is significantly larger than that on cylinder 1. Such synchronized flows occur when the coupling strength is above a critical value. This critical coupling strength increases with oscillators\u2019 frequency detuning, i.e., the size ratio r between the two cylinders. Thus, the region of synchronized flow in the r-g map exhibits the shape of an inverse Arnold\u2019s tongue (Pikovsky et al. 2001), as shown in figure 4. Note that the region of synchronization on the side of r > 1 is slightly larger than that for r < 1. This suggests that the wake coupling is stronger when the strength of vortex shedding is higher.\nThe bottom of the inverse Arnold\u2019s tongue is cut at g \u2248 1.2\u22121.4, below which chaotic flows featured by irregular vortex shedding and unorganized lift phase trajectory are observed. This is different from the scenario in some coupled oscillator systems where the Arnold\u2019s tongue expands infinitely with increasing coupling strength (Pikovsky et al. 2001). In the current case, the approaching of two side-by-side wakes results in a jetlike velocity profile in between. The complex nonlinear interactions between these three instability mechanisms, i.e., two wakes and a jet, could lead to the chaotic flows.\n3.2. Spectral analysis\nIn this section, we focus on the quasi-periodic and synchronized flows to reveal how one wake affects its peer in a quantitative manner. This is achieved through an advanced spectral analysis using the Numerical Analysis of Fundamental Frequencies (NAFF) algorithm (Laskar 1990, 1999), which provides an accurate quasi-periodic approximation of the signal. The algorithm starts by applying a Hanning window to the signal. Next, conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to the signal to find the peaked frequency, which is used as the initial estimate for a numerical optimization of the overlap between the signal and e\u2212i2\u03c0ft (f is the frequency to be determined). This allows\ndetermining f as well as the corresponding amplitude and phase with high accuracy. Once f is determined, the overlap is subtracted from the original signal and the process is repeated to find the other frequencies. The use of the NAFF algorithm avoids the spectral leakage problem that plagues the conventional FFT for quasi-periodic signals, and is critical for accurately quantifying the mutual interactions between the two wakes.\nThe amplitude spectra of the lift coefficients for cases with r = 1.15 in the synchronized and quasi-periodic regimes are presented in figure 5(a, b). For both cylinders, the lift coefficients are mainly composed of two primary frequencies denoted as f1 and f2, which are associated with the wakes of cylinders 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the two lift coefficients can be expressed as\nCl,1 = A1,1 sin(2\u03c0f1t+ \u03c61,1) +A1,2 sin(2\u03c0f2t+ \u03c61,2) + ..., Cl,2 = A2,1 sin(2\u03c0f1t+ \u03c62,1) +A2,2 sin(2\u03c0f2t+ \u03c62,2) + ..., (3.1)\nwhere Ai,j is the amplitude associated with the frequency component fj on cylinder i, and \u03c6i,j is the corresponding phase. Here, A1,1 and A2,2 represent the strengths of vortex shedding of the two cylinders, and A1,2 and A2,1 characterize the mutual interference effects of the parallel wakes. The phase differences associated with the two primary frequencies are defined as \u2206\u03c61 = \u03c61,1 \u2212 \u03c62,1 and \u2206\u03c62 = \u03c61,2 \u2212 \u03c62,2.\nOver the quasi-periodic flows studied herein, the strengths of vortex shedding for both cylinders (A1,1, A2,2) exhibit small variations with respect to the gap ratio, and tend towards their respective values in the single cylinder cases. On the other hand, the primary frequencies f1 and f2 in the coupled wake are significantly larger than the natural\nshedding frequencies for both cylinders. The mutual interference terms A1,2 and A2,1 are considerably smaller than the strengths of both wakes. Both quantities decay as the gap ratio increases, indicating the weakening of mutual interactions. It is also noted that due to nonlinear triad interactions between the two wakes, other frequency components with mf1 \u00b1 nf2 (where m and n are integer numbers) known as sidebands (Craik 1988; Li & Juniper 2013) are also observed in the lift spectra for quasi-periodic flows, although their amplitudes are generally smaller than those of the primary frequencies.\nThe flow transitions from quasi-periodicity to synchronization as the gap ratio decreases below 1.8. This is accompanied by abrupt drops in the strength and frequency of wake 1. On the other hand, the strength and frequency for wake 2 exhibit small variations over the transition. These observations suggest that the the process of synchronization is dominated by the stronger wake, to which the weaker wake is attracted. Such masterslave coupling is ubiquitous in nonlinear interactions of nonidentical oscillators (Pikovsky et al. 2001). The transition to synchronization is also associated with abrupt jumps in the phase differences of the primary frequencies on both cylinders, as observed in figure 5(f).\nWe further assess the effects of size ratio on lift spectra in figure 6. As expected, with growing diameter of cylinder 2, its strength of vortex shedding increases, and the frequency decreases. In the quasi-periodic flows, the strength and frequency of vortex shedding for cylinder 1 both increase slightly increasing r. The effect of cylinder 1 on wake 2 (indicated by A2,1) weakens with increasing size ratio. In contrast, the effect of cylinder 2 on wake 1 (A1,2) is lower at r = 1.1 than r = 1.2 and 1.3, especially for cases with small gap ratios. During synchronization, the frequency of wake 1 submits to that of wake 2, and the strength of wake 1 decreases with the size ratio considerably, resulting in large difference in the lift amplitudes between the \u201cmaster\u201d and \u201cslave\u201d oscillators. The phase differences \u2206\u03c61 and \u2206\u03c62 are positively related with the size ratio r during synchronization. For quasi-periodic flows, the phase difference associated with f2 is considerably higher than that with f1. Although omitted here, the above observations also apply to cases with r < 1, for which the synchronization becomes dominated by cylinder\n1. From the above results, the in-phase and anti-phase synchronized flows observed in the r = 1 cases can be regarded as special cases of the synchronized flow and the quasiperiodic flow, respectively.\n3.3. Modes of interaction\nWe further perform dynamic mode decomposition (Schmid 2010; Rowley et al. 2009) on the time-resolved vorticity fields to extract the coherent structures associated with the various frequency components in the coupled wakes. The dynamic modes for three types of synchronized wakes are shown in figure 7. For (r, g) = (1, 1.5), the in-phase\nsynchronized flow features a pair of identical Ka\u0301rma\u0301n-like shedding mode in the near wake. The two parallel wakes then merge at downstream, forming a single vortex street. The anti-phase lock-in flow features two separate rows of Ka\u0301rma\u0301n wake structures, which are anti-symmetric with each other with respect to the x axis. For r = 1.15, the synchronized wake mode at g = 1.5 resembles the in-phase shedding mode of the case (r, g) = (1, 1.5). However, due to the size difference, the mode is not perfectly symmetric along the x axis.\nThe dynamic modes for the quasi-periodic flows exhibit rich features as shown in figure 8. The primary frequencies f1 and f2 are associated with typical Ka\u0301rma\u0301n modes in the near wake of each cylinder, with their imprints also appearing in the neighbouring wake. The signature of the f1 mode in the wake of cylinder 2 is stronger, and appears closer to the bodies, than that of the f2 mode in cylinder 1\u2019s wake. This is in agreement with the observation in figure 5 that A2,1 is larger than A1,2. With growing gap ratio, these imprints shift downstream, suggesting the weakening of mutual interactions. These primary modes are strong in the near wake and decay towards far wake.\nThe dynamic modes associated with the sideband frequencies (mf1 + nf2) feature coherent structures of varying spatial scales. The lower frequency corresponds to largerscale structures, and high frequency the finer. Unlike the primary modes with frequencies f1 and f2 that are prevalent in the near wake, the dynamic modes of the sideband frequencies are weak in near wake, and grows downstream to dominate the far wake, especially for cases with large gap ratios. As a result, these sideband frequencies are less felt in the lift forces, as observed in figure 5(a, b). The nonlinear interaction between the two nonidentical cylinder wakes breeds a cascade of dynamic modes with various spatiotemporal scales as the flow convects downstream, and increases the complexity of the far wake in quasi-periodic flows."

            "text": "We have systematically studied flows over a pair of side-by-side circular cylinders with different sizes at a fixed Reynolds number of 100 using direct numerical simulations. The aim is to understand how the parallel wakes affect each other in a quantitative manner. Over a range of size ratios and gap ratios, the coupled wakes exhibit distinct dynamical features including the quasi-periodic flows for cases with large gap ratio, chaotic flow for cases with small gap ratio, and synchronized flows in between taking the shape of an inverse Arnold\u2019s tongue in the r\u2013g space. To quantify the mutual interactions of the parallel wakes, spectral analysis and dynamic mode decomposition are performed to extract the frequencies and the associated amplitudes, phases, and spatial modes from the flows. We show that the quasi-periodic flows are mainly featured by two primary frequencies generated from the vortex streets behind the two cylinders. The nonlinear interactions between two vortex streets not only leave signature of each primary mode in the wake of the neighbouring cylinder, but also breed the triad sideband frequencies that become more active in the far wake. Over the transition from the quasi-periodicity to synchronization, the vortex shedding behind the smaller cylinder submits to the larger\u2019s wake, while the latter remains almost unchanged in terms of shedding frequency and strength. The new insights obtained from this study improve the current understanding of flows over two side-by-side cylinders, and are important for interpreting more complicated wake interactions problems.\nAcknowledgement.
