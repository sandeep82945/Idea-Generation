    "abstractText": "Different species of microorganisms colonize the plastic surfaces and form biofilms depending on the aquatic environment. In the current investigation, characteristics of the plastic surface after exposure to three different aquatic environments based on visualization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectroscopic (diffuse reflectance (DR) and infrared (IR)) techniques were examined in laboratory bioreactors with time. For both materials, there were no differences observed in the ultraviolet (UV) region among the reactors and several peaks were observed with fluctuating intensities and without any trends. For light density polyethylene (LDPE), peaks indicating the presence of biofilm could be observed in the visible region for activated sludge bioreactor, and for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), freshwater algae biofilm was also visible. PET in freshwater bioreactor is the most densely populated sample both under the optical microscope and SEM. Based on the DR spectra, different visible peaks for LDPE and PET were observed but, in both cases, the visible region peaks (~ 450 and 670 nm) correspond to the peaks found in the water samples of the bioreactors. The difference on these surfaces could not be identified with IR but the fluctuations observed in the UV wavelength region were also detectable using indices obtained from the IR spectra such as keto, ester, and vinyl. For instance, the virgin PET sample shows higher values in all the indices than the virgin LDPE sample [(virgin LDPE: ester Index (I) = 0.051, keto I = 0.039, vinyl I = 0.067), (virgin PET: ester I = 3.5, keto I = 19, vinyl I = 0.18)]. This suggests that virgin PET surface is hydrophilic as expected. At the same time, for all the LDPE samples, all the indices demonstrated higher values (especially for R2) than the virgin LDPE. On the other hand, ester and keto indices for PET samples demonstrated lower values than virgin PET. In addition, DRS technique was able to identify the formation of the biofilm both on wet and dry samples. Both DRS and IR can describe changes in the hydrophobicity during the initial formation of biofilm but DRS can better describe the fluctuations of biofilm in the visible spectra region.",

            "text": "There is a relative high number of studies on environmental burden caused by plastic litter (Takada and Karapanagioti\u00a02019; Karapanagioti and Kalavrouziotis\u00a02019). The most widely spread plastic waste are low-density\npolyethylene (LDPE, LLDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), foamed polystyrene, nylon (PA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and cellulose acetate (CA) (Andrady et\u00a0al.\u00a02011). They can be observed in different aquatic environments, such as marine environment (Schneider et\u00a0al.\u00a02018), lakes, rivers, as well as urban areas from which they end up in artificial aquatic environments, i.e., wastewater treatment plants (Blettler et\u00a0al.\u00a02018). According to a review study (Schwarz et\u00a0al.\u00a02019) about different plastic types in aquatic environments, a relative high input of PET was mentioned (density class: high), while polyethylene (PE) was detected in all aquatic fields.\nA film of microbial diversity called biofilm (Donlan\u00a0 2002), or plastishere in the case of plastic surface\nResponsible Editor: Lotfi Aleya\n* Hrissi Kassiani Karapanagioti karapanagioti@upatras.gr\n1 Department of\u00a0Chemistry, University of\u00a0Patras, 26504\u00a0Patras, Greece\n2 School of\u00a0Sciences and\u00a0Engineering, University of\u00a0Nicosia, 2417\u00a0Nicosia, Cyprus\n1 3\n(Rummel et\u00a0al.\u00a02017; Zettler et\u00a0al.\u00a02013) is potentially developed on any surface in an aqueous environment. In a recent study by Tziourrou et\u00a0al. (2020), using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) technique, they observed that biofilm in the marine environment does not develop randomly but in a specific way, depending on the type of plastic material. The steps followed by the creation and development of a biofilm on a surface are generally as follows: (a) reversible attachment of bacteria, (b) irreversible attachment of a surface by microorganisms, (c) biofilm maturation, and (d) biofilm dispersion (Khatoon et\u00a0al.\u00a02018; Donlan\u00a02002). Studies have reported chemical alterations (i.e., functional groups) of plastics due to their exposure to microorganisms [Fotopoulou and Karapanagioti (2017) and references within].\nThe techniques used to study biofilms can vary from biological, physicochemical (Azeredo et\u00a0al.\u00a02017), microscopy techniques (Pantanella et\u00a0al.\u00a02013) to mathematical modeling (Wilson et\u00a0al.\u00a02017). There are very few publications which study biofilm on plastics directly after sampling from the field or during a laboratory experiment, without any pretreatment or alteration of the sample (e.g., Tziourrou et\u00a0al.\u00a02020; Sfaelou et\u00a0al.\u00a02015a); in other words, the study of biofilm as a material that alters polymer surfaces at different periods (e.g., color change of biofilm) needs to be further studied.\nUV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy can be used as a useful method for microorganism determination (Badri et\u00a0al.\u00a02015). According to Alupoaei and Garcia-Rubio (2005), UV-vis spectra of microorganisms contain information on their properties (e.g., chemical composition, internal structure, number, size, and shape). Correlating natural and artificial marine environments, the research supported that biofilm patterns were related to DRS peaks; more specifically, the fluctuation of the DR spectra depended on the polymer type and the time period of biofilm formation on plastic surfaces (Tziourrou et\u00a0al.\u00a02020).\nThe purpose of the present study was to compare the biofilm formation on two commonly used plastics such as LDPE and PET in three different laboratory aqueous systems with various microorganisms. Specifically, the laboratory bioreactors were used to simulate a marine environment, the aeration tank of a wastewater treatment plant, and a freshwater pond environment. At different residence times, biofilms were characterized (using DRS) in both materials and simultaneous check for changes in their IR spectra. The specific objectives of the present study were (a) to check if the DRS measurements would provide different spectra for biofilm formed by different microorganisms and on various plastic surfaces; (b) to identify changes in the spectra due to the desiccation of samples, e.g., dry plastic samples collected from a beach; (c) to compare information collected with DRS to that collected with IR spectra and determine their qualitative differences.\nThe main scope of this work is to demonstrate that DRS is a valuable technique, very fast and with low cost, and that it can be applied to give information about the formation of biofilm even in almost not-detectable conditions. Also, it can give this information independably of the biofilm type, bacteria type, and time. It may be used for the identification of the biofilm on polymer surfaces. The proposed technique can be directly applied in the field, demands no special treatment, and even no highly qualified personnel, it is not destructive, which is very important in laboratory experiments, in food industry and in many more applications.\nPolyethylene is the most common polymer produced and thus, the most found in the environment. LDPE and PET were chosen in the present study because they are very different in the polarity and the surface groups. It is considered important to investigate if the polarity of the support (polymer) can alter the macro-characteristics and the amount of the biofilm. This study involves many different parameters such as 2 polymers, 3 bioreactors, 2 different analytical techniques, 2 different sample states, dry and wet, and several different sampling points in time."

The absorption spectra of the liquid phase of the bioreactors were recorded from 200 to 800 nm. Subsequently, for the comparison of the initial and final stages (namely after creating biofilm) spectra were obtained in the UV-vis region (ultraviolet-visible) using DRS (diffuse reflection UV-vis spectroscopy) method. Each time, a virgin plastic strip by the same material was used as blank against plastic strip with biofilm; thus, peaks of DR spectra were related to the biofilm formed on the plastic strips.\nThe Kubelka-Munk equation (outcome is F(R)) is used for DR spectroscopy. For the solid samples the technique measures the reflectance of the visible radiation spectrum that cannot penetrate the sample. The F(R) which is an expression taking into account the absorption and scattering that result from the sample, rather than the reflectance, can be used. These values are proportional to the absorbance of the sample. This is a method used in the past by our group for the observation of biofilm formation (Tziourrou et\u00a0al.\u00a02020; Sfaelou et\u00a0al.\u00a02015a) and polymer degradation (Rtimi et\u00a0al.\u00a02015).\nFor functional groups identification for these samples, attenuated total reflectance\u2013Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) (model: \u201cBruker Optics\u2019 AlphaP Diamond ATR Spectrometer of Bruker Optics GmbH\u201d) was used.

In general, \ud835\udc5b\u2013\ud835\udf0e\u2217 and/or \ud835\udf0b\u2013\ud835\udf0b\u2217  electron transitions (peaks at 200 \u2013 220 nm) can be detected in several organic functional groups while \ud835\udf0b\u2013\ud835\udf0b\u2217 and n\u2013\ud835\udf0b\u2217  transitions at 260\u2013280 nm found in aromatic/polyaromatic compounds and conjugated molecules (including proteins and nucleic acids), respectively (Bikova and Treimanis 2004; Jia et\u00a0al. 2007; Trabelsi et\u00a0al. 2009; Rtimi et\u00a0al.\u00a02015).\nIn a previous study performed by our group (Tziourrou et\u00a0al.\u00a02020), during field experiments exposing similar plastic strips to the marine environment, it was found that the polymer type is only important for the colonization during the first period. PET is colonized faster during this initial phase than LDPE due to its low hydrophobicity. After this initial colonization has covered the surface, the next phase is similar for both polymers since the surface is at this point covered by similar molecules. This is not totally true for the present study, since the number of organisms in the bioreactors is not infinite and it is regulated by the addition of glucose. Although, the above microorganisms are attached to\n1 3\nthe surface only in some cases, biofilm formation is observed as indicated by peaks at the visible wavelength region.\nIn the present study, for LDPE, peaks indicating the presence of biofilm could be observed in the visible region for R2 and for PET, freshwater algae (R3) biofilm was also visible. PET in R3 is also the most densely populated sample both under the optical microscope (Fig.\u00a02) and SEM (Fig.\u00a05). Based on the DR spectra, different visible peaks for LDPE and PET were observed but, in both cases, the visible region peaks correspond to the peaks found in the water samples of the bioreactors (Fig.\u00a06). This indicates that the growth of microorganisms depends not only on the length of contact time, but also on the type of material. Also, the patterns that can be seen for the fluctuation of peaks and their intensities could indicate periodic attachment and detachment of the microorganisms and/or the biofilm (Trulear and Characklis 1982).\nSmall differences were observed between DRS measurements for the samples that were wet compared to those that were allowed to dry at room temperature for 2 weeks. The peaks found at the UV region remain even after drying the samples and some of them increase in intensity. These\npeaks correspond to sorbed microorganisms. Peaks at visible wavelength region decrease in intensity suggesting the shrinking of the biofilm and the degradation of its colour but they were still present at the same wavelength. Alupoaei and Garcia-Rubio (2004) observed that the distribution of intensities as a function of wavelength depends on the size, shape, and optical properties of the microorganisms or cells. Another important point is the effect of relative humidity which varied with species (McEldowney and Fletcher\u00a01988); for instance, Pseudomonas sp. increased under desiccation conditions."

            "text": "In both cases, different transmittance (%) values of the LDPE and PET samples were observed. This was likely related to biofilm characteristics. Specifically, according to Davis et\u00a0al. (2011) the relative intensity among live and dead Escherichia coli cells were different using FT-IR spectra (700\u20134000 cm\u22121); lower intensity was observed for the dead cells.\n1 3\nBased on the IR spectra, different fluctuations of ester, keto, and vinyl indices were observed (Fig.\u00a013) from day 0 to day 50. \u03a4he virgin PET sample shows higher values in all the indices than the virgin LDPE sample as expected based on the carbonyl and aromatic groups present in PET monomer; [(virgin LDPE: ester in.= 0.051, keto in.= 0.039, vinyl in.= 0.067 similar indices values were calculated also by Tziourrou et\u00a0al. (2021)), (virgin PET: ester in.= 3.5, keto in.= 19, vinyl in.= 0.18)]. This suggests that virgin PET surface is hydrophilic as expected.\nFor all the LDPE samples, all the indices demonstrated higher values (especially for R2) than the virgin LDPE. On the other hand, ester and keto indices for PET samples demonstrated lower values than virgin PET while vinyl index values seem to be similar with LDPE. The fluctuations of the values depend on the microorganisms (Albertsson et\u00a0al.\u00a01987). The patterns that can be seen for the indices could indicate periodic attachment and detachment of the microorganisms and/or the biofilm (Trulear and Characklis 1982). Actually, the indices increase and decrease several times, and actually more times for PET compared to LDPE corroborating previous findings the colonization of PET is faster than of LDPE (Tziourrou et\u00a0al.\u00a02020) due to its hydrophilicity.\nFotopoulou and Karapanagioti (2015b) suggested the colonization of PET by non-polar organisms assuming that the initial step for PET degradation is the colonization by these\norganisms. This is corroborated by the lower ester and keto indices of the PET covered by biofilm which however are higher than for LDPE suggesting that they are not that high due to the biofilm but due to PET itself. PET ester and keto indices have decreased due to biofilm covering most of the original carbonyl groups. The carbonyl groups formed due to biofilm are negligible compared to original PET carbonyl groups.\nIt is obvious that if only IR spectra are considered, the fluctuations observed in the DRS technique at the UV wavelength region is also identified. However, the difference on the surface of HDPE in R2 or PET in R3 cannot be identified. DRS technique was able to identify the formation of the biofilm both on wet and dry samples."

            "text": "In this study, the first objective was to compare the biofilm formation on two commonly used plastics such as LDPE and PET. Sfaelou et\u00a0al. (2015a) concluded that the polarity of the surface can influence biofilm quantity; more specifically, the surface with polar groups is more supportive to the formation of biofilm than a hydrophobic surface. Compared to hydrophobic surfaces, hydrophilic surfaces more quickly build up biomolecules that increase surface roughness, which may assist microbial adhesion (Bhagwat et\u00a0al.\u00a02021).\n1 3\nIndeed, plastic substrate properties affect or select biofilm communities to be initially attached on the biomolecules structure however biofilm formation causes physicochemical properties of the plastic surface to somewhat converge over time (McGivney et\u00a0al.\u00a02020) as in Fig.\u00a013. This is also observed in the present study as well as in the previous one (Tziourrou et\u00a0al.\u00a02020). So, if all plastics have a similar surface, similar organisms are more abundant, and this can explain the observation by Krause et\u00a0al. (2020) and Shen et\u00a0al. (2021) that lower biodiversity is recorded on plastic biofilms compared to the surrounding environment. Also, according to Shen et\u00a0al. (2021) plastic biofilms have a preference for pathogenic bacteria which should be true for all plastics since ultimately, they grow biofilms with similar surface properties.\nThe second parameter to be studied was the effect of the different environments and the various organisms found in these environments on the biofilm formation considering that plastics can be found in many different aquatic environment settings [e.g., marine environment: Baltic Sea (McGivney et\u00a0al.\u00a02020) and abyssal seafloor (Krause et\u00a0al. 2020), freshwater: Xuanwu Lake (Shen et\u00a0al.\u00a02021), wastewater (Sfaelou et\u00a0al.\u00a02015a)]. Bacteria and algae found in R1 and R3 have a negative charge and varying degrees of hydrophobicity on their surfaces (Pal and Lavanya\u00a02022; Ozkan and Berberoglou\u00a02013). Since these microorganisms have a negative charge, they are attracted to positively charged surfaces. Negatively charged bacteria repel negatively charged surfaces by electrostatic forces. Ozkan and Berberoglou (2013) observed higher negatively surface charge for the saltwater algae than freshwater. This can explain the higher affinity of freshwater algae in R3 for the PET plastic surface compared to the affinity of saltwater algae in R1. The presence of salt in R1 creates an environment with high ionic strength that decreases the surface charge of PET making it more hydrophobic (Jones et\u00a0al.\u00a01999) causing it to have a similar behavior with HDPE but slightly higher initial attachment.\nFor the activated sludge system in R2, in our previous study, we have observed that although it contains functional groups that are both positive and negative, around neutral pH, the surface of the microorganisms is also neutral (Sfaelou et\u00a0al.\u00a02015b). This property makes the activated sludge less hydrophilic, and thus, it is easier to be attached to hydrophobic surfaces or to create flocs. Thus, this corroborates the formation of biofilm in R2 only on the hydrophobic LDPE and not on PET (even though PET had a higher initial colonization that created an initial roughness).\nIn a wastewater treatment plant, LDPE that floats in the aeration tank will obtain a biofilm with higher mass than PET. However, PET will obtain a coverage of biomolecules that will make it more hydrophobic.\nIn natural aquatic environments, LDPE floats and this property does not favor biofilm formation since it will mainly attract any hydrophobic microorganisms that are left on the surface. Most of the bacteria that are hydrophobic\nare benthic or are creating flocs (Fattom and Shilo\u00a01984). Thus, LDPE that is moved to the bottom of the aquatic system is expected to have higher biofilm formation than the floating LDPE due to the presence of hydrophobic microorganisms found there. PET sorbs most aquatic biomolecules while floating and in freshwater after the initial roughness is formed, it can attract microalgae. Based on our previous experience with field experiments (Tziourrou et\u00a0al.\u00a02020), both LDPE and PET will form biofilm in the open sea because of the higher biodiversity of the sea compared to experimental setups used in the present study. Nevertheless, biofilm formation on LDPE will be higher and faster in benthos whereas on PET will be higher in freshwater systems."

            "text": "Based on microscopy observations, different species of microorganisms on both plastic surfaces were observed. DR spectra indicate different fluctuations among plastic materials, between the aquatic environments and relative humidity conditions (wet vs dry samples). Biofilm formation on the plastic samples was dependent of the material and type of the aquatic environment due to different biodiversity and differences of the hydrophobicity of the organisms. Alterations of the hydrophobicity of LDPE and PET samples were observed, based on IR spectra which were independent of aquatic environments, the same was true for the DRS peaks at the UV wavelength region. However, IR could not describe the formation of biofilm that created peaks in the visible region of DRS.\nWe propose future investigations to concentrate to the study (1) of biofilm formation on control degraded plastic samples due to plastic litter in the environment affected by solar UV radiation and (2) the correlation of DRS with microbiological analyses; in addition, more chemical composition information on plastic litter can be investigated, by inactive microorganisms on plastic surfaces (e.g., when membranes of dead microorganisms are broken down). Metagenomic sequencing of the bioreactor biomass (biofilm) DNA is required to analyze the microbial community and provide more meaningful results in the scientific community that is not only interested in the surface chemistry changes. Employing a negative control (sterile test water) with a strain that does not produce biofilm could be used to allow a better comparison with the original community in the three environments used.\nAbbreviations ATR-FTIR:\u00a0attenuated total reflectance\u2013Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; DR:\u00a0diffuse reflectance; DRS:\u00a0diffuse reflectance spectra; HDPE:\u00a0high-density polyethylene; IR:\u00a0infrared; LDPE:\u00a0light density polyethylene; PET:\u00a0polyethylene terephthalate; R1:\u00a0bioreactor with seawater; R2:\u00a0bioreactor with activated sludge; R3:\u00a0bioreactor with freshwater algae; SEM:\u00a0scanning electron microscopy; UV-vis:\u00a0ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrometry\n1 3\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11356- 023- 27163-2.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Prof. J.K.
