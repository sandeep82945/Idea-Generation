    "abstractText": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising therapeutic entities in part due to their potential to regulate multiple signaling pathways in target cells. This potential is derived from the broad array of constituent and/or cargo molecules associated with EVs. Among these, microRNAs (miRNAs) are commonly implicated as important and have been associated with a wide variety of EV-induced biological phenomena. While controlled loading of single miRNAs is a well-documented approach for enhancing EV bioactivity, loading of multiple miRNAs has not been fully leveraged to maximize the potential of EV-based therapies. Here, an established approach to extrinsic nucleic acid loading of EVs, sonication, was utilized to load multiple miRNAs in HEK293T EVs. Combinations of miRNAs were compared to single miRNAs with respect to anti-inflammatory outcomes in assays of increasing stringency, with the combination of miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223 found to have the most potential amongst the tested groups.",

            "text": "Inflammation-related diseases are responsible for millions of deaths every year [1,2]. While inflammation is a critical part of an effective response to harmful stimuli, inappropriate acute or chronic inflammatory signaling can cause harm to the body. Widespread adoption of inflammation management protocols has helped to lower the death rates, but there are still many inflammatory disorders for which there are no specific approved treatments. As a result, new therapeutic approaches are being pursued. An emerging strategy involves microRNAs (miRNAs), which have been shown to play significant roles in inflammation in general and in specific inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, both in promoting pathogenesis as well as recovery [3\u201315]. For example, miRNAs such as miR-146a and miR-223 have been shown to be downregulated in both septic vs. healthy patients and in non-surviving vs. surviving patients [4]. Thus, the concept of therapeutic miRNA delivery is intriguing as a possible novel anti-inflammatory treatment. When considering potential vehicles for miRNA delivery, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been implicated as promising based on their reported natural ability to facilitate intercellular RNA transfer [16]. While the physiological significance of EV-mediated miRNA transfer is still controversial [17\u201319], the capabilities of specifically-loaded EVs for small RNA delivery (siRNA and miRNA) have been clearly established [20\u201322]. Further, direct comparisons of EVs and other potential miRNA delivery vehicles such as liposomes have\nNon-Coding RNA 2022, 8, 71. https://doi.org/10.3390/ncrna8050071 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ncrna\nindicated the potential superiority of EVs [23\u201325]. Thus, EV-mediated miRNA delivery to treat inflammation is worthy of focused investigation. Here, we built on previous work from our group using a sonication-based miRNA loading strategy to package miRNA into EVs without requiring chemical modifications [26]. Our prior study, similar to many in the field to date, investigated delivery of only a single miRNA species. In this work, we sought to exploit the potential synergy of regulating multiple anti-inflammatory pathways by loading multiple miRNA species into a single EV population. Combinations of miRNAs were tested in an in vitro macrophage inflammation model, which was previously shown to correlate with in vivo outcomes for EVs [27]. Finally, the most effective combination was tested in an in vivo endotoxemia model."

            "text": "We previously established that sonication enables the loading of miRNA into EVs with only slight diminishment of in vitro EV uptake compared to unmodified EVs [26]. In this study, we demonstrated that the loading of two different small RNA sequences by sonication was predictable based on the proportion of their concentration in solution, and that loading of three distinct miRNAs can potentially yield improved anti-inflammatory bioactivity compared to a single miRNA delivery. This technique may thus allow several advantages over competing EV loading strategies. Any mixture of miRNA sequences can potentially be loaded into a single EV population with a reproducible loading efficiency, though it is possible some sequences may behave in different fashion. As opposed to mixtures of singly loaded EVs, the premixing of miRNA allows for the possibility of loading multiple miRNAs into a single vesicle, promoting proportional delivery to a recipient cell. This exogenous loading technique is also adaptable for any small RNA cargo and does not require any manipulation of the cargo or producer cells. Future tests, including for the specific combination of miR-155, miR-223, and miR-146a, should be performed to determine the percentage of loaded EVs and if any specific subpopulation of EVs is preferentially loaded by this technique. To take advantage of this system, we performed a screen for anti-inflammatory miRNA combinations using a limited number of miRNAs selected from the literature. These miRNA combinations were passed through progressively more rigorous LPS challenges in vitro to determine if any specific combination of miRNAs was superior in reducing inflammation. That process identified the combination of miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223 as being the most efficacious amongst the examined groups in reducing IL-6 production by RAW264.7 macrophages in response to the LPS. This finding echoes work by Bhaskaran et al. that found that overexpression of three miRNAs in glioblastoma had a combinatorial anticancer effect [42], as well as a clinical study by Marik et al. which found that a combination of hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine worked synergistically as an anti-inflammatory against sepsis [43,44]. miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223 have been studied as anti-inflammatory miRNAs that change expression levels in response to LPS and target proteins in the TLR4 pathway [30\u201332,45]. Interestingly, these miRNA targets are largely nonoverlapping, perhaps indicating that when attempting to downregulate a cellular pathway, greater effect may be achieved by targeting different proteins in that pathway rather than focusing on one protein. Work by Schulte et al. described the tiered response by macrophages to LPS, in which miR146 expression saturated at even sub-inflammatory LPS concentrations in order to protect against hypersensitivity, whereas miR-155 was expressed proportionally over a broad range of LPS concentrations in order to respond appropriately to the level of stimulation [46]. This indicates that both miRNAs seem to work in tandem to prevent an extreme cellular response. However, in other contexts, introducing miR-155 has been shown to be proinflammatory [47,48]. For example, EVs from wildtype bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) increased IL-6 production in response to LPS in miR-155\u2212/\u2212 BMDCs and mice, compared to EVs from miR-155\u2212/\u2212 BMDCs [49]. These seemingly contradictory results indicate that miR-155 activity is nuanced and likely context dependent. Concurrent introduction of other anti-inflammatory miRNAs such as miR-146a and miR-223 may tilt the RNA network towards an environment in which miR-155 suppresses inflammation. The results of our protein array showed a downregulation of IL-6, as expected. CCL22 and CCL17, the two CCR4 ligands, which are involved in T-cell chemotaxis, were also downregulated by the 146a/155/223 treatment. Interestingly, in an LPS challenge model, CCR4-deficient mice had decreased cytokine release and a higher survival rate when compared to wildtype mice [50]. In another study, CCR4-deficient mice had reduced immune response and greater survival after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and greater responsiveness and survival to a secondary fungal challenge [51]. These previous results indicated that, in addition to inhibition of IL-6, inhibition of the CCR4 ligands CCL22 and CCL17 may lead to an improved outcome in vivo.\nDespite these encouraging signs, we saw no significant decrease in proinflammatory cytokines in response to 146a/155/223 in vivo. There are multiple reasons why this may be the case. Firstly, since cell source plays a role in EV biodistribution and delivery [52], the choice of HEK293-derived EVs may limit an in vivo effect. A recent study showed that HEK293 EVs have a short half-life in healthy mice; in one hour, 80% of EVs were cleared from the circulation [53]. It is possible that cargo packaged within EVs from mesenchymal stromal cells or another cell source could have a greater chance of functional delivery. Additionally, while sonication may inhibit EV delivery only slightly in vitro, this effect may be increased under more challenging delivery conditions in vivo. Finally, the in vitro model used to screen for anti-inflammatory effects may be insufficiently representative of in vivo dynamics, despite the prior correlation noted in the literature [27]. For example, the RAW264.7 macrophage model may be insufficiently representative of native macrophage behavior and is certainly insufficiently representative of other cell types affected by LPS injection."

            "text": "RAW264.7 cells were seeded in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS in a 48-well plate at 100,000 cells per well. All EVs were prepared by sonication, and doses were normalized by protein content after sonication and washing. All treatments were diluted in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. In the \u201cpre-treat\u201d regime, cells were treated with EVs for 24 h; then, the supernatant was replaced by media with 10 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; L4391) for 4 h. In the \u201cco-treat\u201d regime, both EV treatments and 10 ng/mL LPS were added concomitantly for 24 h. In the \u201cpost-treat\u201d regime, cells were treated with 10 ng/mL LPS for 24 h and then 10 ng/mL LPS with EV treatments for another 24 h. As a negative control for each experiment, both no EVs (PBS only) and EVs sonicated without miRNA were added to cells. Dexamethasone (10 \u00b5g/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich; D4902) was added as a positive control. After all final treatments, the media were collected and stored at \u221280 \u25e6C. The IL-6 concentration was determined using the Mouse IL-6 DuoSet ELISA Kit (R&D Systems; DY406). For the \u201cco-treat\u201d regime, phagocytosis was measured after the removal of the media, using the Vybrant Phagocytosis Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; V-6694) and following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, fluorescein-labeled E. coli-derived particles were added to cells for 2 h, after which cell fluorescence was measured in a plate reader. All tests were performed in biological triplicate."

The animals were kept at a constant temperature (25 \u25e6C) under a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. On the first and second day, animals received a 200 \u00b5L intraperitoneal injection of PBS or sonicated EVs at a concentration of 2.1 \u00d7 1010 particles/mL (by NTA). On the third day, animals received an intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg LPS. Three hours later, animals were anesthetized and sacrificed via cardiac blood collection. Blood was collected into EDTA-coated tubes (Greiner Bio-One; Monroe, NC, USA) and spun at 1000\u00d7 g for 15 min to produce plasma. All animal work was carried out in accordance with the NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Maryland College Park."

            "text": "Sonication is an effective method for loading multiple miRNAs into EVs in predictable proportions. Given the vast number of targets that are regulated by any one miRNA sequence, it would be difficult to fully map or predict the changes in the transcriptome, proteome, or phenotype of a cell that takes up one miRNA, let alone three. In this way, while the literature can guide the selection of therapeutic miRNA, empirical combinatorial testing of multiple miRNAs may be necessary when seeking to design an miRNA-based therapeutic. This work, which by no means exhausts the possible space of miRNA combinations, is nonetheless our attempt to illuminate the strengths of such an approach.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ncrna8050071/s1, Figure S1: Original western blot images.
