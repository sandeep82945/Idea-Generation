This nanoemulsion uses gelatin as a scaffold and eugenol (from clove oil)27 to provide a non-toxic hydrophobic phase for TMC encapsulation. This scaffold was then used to stabilize and solubilize the naturally occurring iron porphyrin hemin as the catalytic center. As a result of carefully choosing the materials, the polyzyme is inherently biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-cytotoxic. This Fe_PZ polyzyme was fabricated by dissolving hemin into eugenol, and emulsifying with dissolved riboavin (vitamin B2) followed by UV exposure to provide stable photo-crosslinked nanoemulsions (Fig. 1a).28 The integration of the hemin catalyst into the highly modular and biodegradable nanoemulsion system affords an all-natural bioorthogonal polyzyme that is translatable and sustainable for biomedical applications. The potential therapeutic application of Fe_PZ was demonstrated through the efficient killing of bacteria in biolms. Heminloaded nanoemulsions efficiently penetrated the biolm and eradicated resident bacteria through in situ activation of a prodrug antibiotic, providing a promising strategy for the treatment of refractory biolm infections.29 Taken together, this polyzyme platform utilizes all-natural components to install drug-activating \u2018nanofactories\u2019 inside biolms, generating imaging and therapeutic agents and minimizing off-target effects.\nChem.

            "text": "Fe_PZ polyzymes were generated by encapsulation of hemin into gelatin nanoemulsions (Fig. 1a).26,30 Eugenol serves as the interior oil phase of the nanoemulsions, providing a favorable environment for encapsulating hemin. Gelatin contains hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid domains that confer surfactant-like properties,31 allowing it to encapsulate the hydrophobic eugenol and the hemin as the TMC. Photoinitiated collagen cross-linking using riboavin (vitamin B2) was adapted from a corneal collagen repair strategy,32 inducing gelatin ber crosslinking and providing highly stable nanoemulsion catalysts (Fig. 1c).\nIron porphyrins catalyze the reduction of aryl azides to the corresponding amines in the presence of biogenic thiols, providing a robust and efficient strategy for uncaging reactions (Fig. 1b).13 Hemin, an endogenous iron-containing porphyrin was chosen as the catalytic center for the polyzymes.33 Hemin features high catalytic efficiency, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. Signicantly, the hydrophobicity of the hemin catalyst facilitated partitioning into the eugenol phase of the nanoemulsion. Utilization of nature-derived components that are well-studied and known for their biocompatibility provides the potential for more rapid translation of these materials.26\nFe_PZ polyzymes were fabricated by emulsifying a suspension of eugenol (3 mL oil loaded with 1 mg mL\u22121 riboavin and 17.2 mg mL\u22121 hemin) into an aqueous solution of gelatin (Fig. 1a). Next, UV irradiation (365 nm) was employed to initiate covalent crosslinking of the gelatin matrix, generating stable nanoemulsions. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements showed that the size of Fe_PZ is 350 nm with a narrow size distribution (polydispersity index \u00bc 0.023) (Fig. 2a). This\n12072 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 12071\u201312077\nparticle diameter is generated under a range of conditions, and was hence used for further studies. The amount of hemin encapsulated into the nanoemulsions was quantied using UVvis spectroscopy, with 0.43 mg catalyst per mg gelatin (Fig. S1\u2020).\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs indicated a spherical morphology for Fe_PZ (Fig. 2b). The size of Fe_PZ revealed by TEM ( 200 nm) is smaller than observed by DLS, presumably due to partial collapse of the polyzymes upon removal of oil core. Aer characterization of the size and morphology of the polyzymes, we examined the colloidal stability and degradability of the polyzyme platform via monitoring changes in particle size by DLS. Fe_PZ remained stable at room temperature for at least 30 days in solution (Fig. 2c). However, these nanoemulsions degraded within an hour in the presence of collagenase I (Fig. 2d).\nNext, we investigated Fe_PZ biocompatibility using mammalian NIH 3T3 broblasts, chosen for the important role broblast cells play in the wound healing process.34 Fibroblasts were incubated with different concentrations of Fe_PZ (in the presence of glutathione (GSH) for 24 h). Then, cell viability was quantied using Alamar Blue assay. As shown in Fig. 2e, Fe_PZ showed no acute cytotoxicity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Moreover, Fe_PZ demonstrated no hemolytic activity against human red blood cells at highest tested concentration of 9.6 mg L\u22121, indicating excellent biocompatibility of this nanoemulsion catalyst (Fig. 2f)."

In contrast, free hemin catalysts at the same concentration suffered a >70% loss of activity (Fig. S2\u2020). For these studies, glutathione (1 mM) was used as a reductant for reductive recycling of the catalyst.

Biolm-associated infections are responsible for several chronic diseases, including wound infections, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and implant dysfunction.29,35 The extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix of biolms serves as a physical barrier to most hydrophobic molecules, rendering biolms challenging to treat.36\nThe ability to transport hydrophobic hemin catalyst into biolms is essential for bioorthogonal activation of imaging agents and therapeutics.13 We rst used confocal laser scanning microscopy to monitor the penetration and distribution of polyzymes into biolms.

PP_PZ was incubated with mature 4 day old biolms of green uorescent protein (GFP)expressing E. coli.

These results indicate that the gelatin-based nanoemulsion transported hydrophobic catalysts deep into biolms for imaging and therapeutic purposes.\nCatalytic efficiency of gelatin polyzymes inside biolms\nHaving demonstrated penetration of the polyzymes into biolms, we next determined their bioorthogonal catalytic properties in biolms through activation of pro-Res, as visualized by confocal microscopy. First, Fe_PZ (4.8 mg L\u22121) polyzymes were incubated with mature 4 day old biolms of green uorescent protein (GFP)-expressing BL21 E. coli for 2 h to allow biolm penetration. Bacterial biolms were then washed with PBS three times to remove any excess polyzyme.\nIn situ bioorthogonal catalysis was then established by incubating the biolms with pro-Res (5 mM) and GSH (1 mM) in M9 media for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 5, the GFP-expressing E. coli can be observed in the green channel. The bright red uorescence indicates that in the presence of polyzyme pro-Res was activated in biolms.

The merged channels demonstrated the colocalization of the generated red resorun with GFP-expressing E. coli, indicating that the uncaged resorun was fully distributed throughout themature biolmmatrix.\nAntimicrobial activity through activation of pro-antibiotics using polyzymes\nThe therapeutic potential of Fe_PZ was demonstrated via the activation of an antibiotic prodrug. The widely used uoroquinolone antibiotic ciprooxacin (Cip) was chosen as the antimicrobial agent due to its broad-spectrum activity.43 The pharmacophore of this antibiotic was blocked through functionalization with a bulky aryl-azide carbamate moiety on its secondary amino group, generating a prodrug (pro-Cip).44 This caging strategy prevents Cip from binding to its target bacterial enzymes, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV,45 diminishing antimicrobial activity by more than two orders of magnitude (Fig. S4\u2020). Pro-Cip was uncaged through bioorthogonal catalysis by polyzymes, releasing the active antimicrobial agent (Fig. 6a).\nThe efficacy of pro-Cip activation was established usingmature 4 day old pathogenic E. coli (CD-2) biolms. These biolms were rst incubated with Fe_PZ for 2 h to allow sufficient biolm penetration. Next, the media was removed, and biolms were washed three times with PBS followed by incubation with pro-Cip and GSH. Control conditions were provided by pro-Cip alone\nFig. 6 (a) Schematic representation of the activation of pro-Ciprofloxacin. We used 1 mMGSH as the cofactor.

As shown in Fig. 6b, biolms incubated with Fe_PZ and proCip demonstrated dose-dependent biolm killing, with efficacy approaching that of ciprooxacin. As expected, biolms incubated with either polyzyme or pro-Cip alone showed no decreased viability at the tested concentrations, demonstrating the biorthogonality of the activation. Signicantly, this therapeutic strategy combining Fe_PZ and pro-Cip showed no acute cytotoxicity at therapeutically relevant concentrations (Fig. S5\u2020). Given that Fe_PZ can eliminate pathogenic biolms without harming mammalian cells, these results demonstrate the potential of the polyzyme platform for treatment of wound biolm infections."

The integration of the hemin catalyst into the nanoemulsion system enhanced the stability and water solubility of the catalyst while preserving its catalytic activity in solution and in the complex environment of biolms, as demonstrated through pro-uorophore activation. These polyzymes (Fe_PZ) were likewise promising therapeutic systems, effectively penetrating into biolms and uncaging pro-antibiotics in situ. Future studies will focus on utilizing the polyzyme platform for in vivo antimicrobial therapy.
