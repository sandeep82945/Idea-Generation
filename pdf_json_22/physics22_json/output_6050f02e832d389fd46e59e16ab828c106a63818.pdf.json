            "text": "The continuous suppression of metal-insulator (MI), charge-density-wave (CDW)\ntransition and magnetism, etc. leading to the occurrence of superconductivity (SC) in the proximity of such quantum states has garnered great interest and widespread study in solid-state physics. [1-4] The phase diagrams of unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) cuprates and iron-based superconductors exemplified such phenomena. [5-11] Nevertheless, how SC emerges in these high- Tc superconductors are intricate and remains extremely puzzling. It is still essential to sort out the interplay between the SC and the other quantum states, promoting further understanding of the mechanism of high- Tc superconductors.\nLow-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are other\nopportune material platforms for the exploration of various quantum instabilities, [12-21] especially the interplay between SC and CDW, in which the CDW order refers to condensate with periodic modulations of the crystalline lattice and conduction electron density in real space. Typically, the SC can be induced and a dome-shape superconducting phase diagram is formed upon suppressing the CDW order, [22-27] which is highly similar to the phase diagrams of unconventional high-Tc cuprates and iron-based superconductors. Despite overall phase diagram similarities, there are significant differences especially between their mechanisms, where unconventional high-Tc Fe-based and cuprate superconductors cannot be well explained by BardeenCooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but most of the TMD superconductors can be explained by BCS theory. It has been generally considered that the collapse of CDW state accompanied by the improvement of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is in reference to the abrupt enhancement of density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level N(EF) in the conventional superconductors owning to CDW state gaps out some regions of the Fermi surface. [1,2] The formation of CuxTiSe2 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.1) from intercalating the Cu into 1T-TiSe2 exemplified a vivid phase diagram in the TMDs family, [2] and further evoked the continuous interest in searching for new superconductors in TMD materials by gating, adding physical pressures, chemical doping or point contact method. [22-38] For example, Cu-intercalation 2H-TaS2 forms CuxTaS2 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.12) and displays an enhancement of Tc from 0.8 K (x = 0) to 4.5 K (x = 0.04). [34] In addition, experiments show that the Tc of WTe2 can be increased to 7 K under an applied physical pressure of 16.8 GPa. [35] Moreover, manifold phase transitions from MI to metal show in 1T-TaS2 thin flakes with collapses of CDWs, and finally SC is induced by ionic gating. [36]\nCurrently, CuIr2Te4, adopting a NiAs defected structure of trigonal symmetry with\nthe space group P-3m1, has been found to exhibit the coexistence of the CDW-like transition (TCDW = 250 K on heating and 186 K on cooling) and SC (Tc = 2.5 K). Besides, recent electronic structure calculations have unveiled that the Fermi energy is mostly derived from Ir 5d and Te 5p orbitals. [39] More recently, experiments have documented that both CDW and SC performances of CuIr2Te4 can be modified via 3d, 4d transition metals (e.g., Ti and Ru) and 4p, 5p dopants (e.g., Se and I). Dome-shape phase diagrams with respect to Tc vs. doping amount associated with the suppression of CDW have been found in the CuIr2-xRuxTe4 and CuIr2-xTixTe4 systems, but dome-shape diagrams\ncrowded in the middle doping region with two CDW regions at two sides in Se and Idoped systems. [40-43] Furthermore, the non-magnetic element Al is usually selected as the dopant because Al3+ ion has a closed shell electron configuration and a clear oxidation state. The transport properties of Al-doped high-Tc copper-based superconductors (e.g. SmBa2Cu3-xAlxO6+\u03b4, YBa2Cu3-xAlxO7) has been widely studied. [44, 45] And nano Al has been used to improve the critical current in MgB2 superconductor. [46] Therefore, it will be interesting to explore the effect of 3s dopants (e.g., Al) on the CDW and SC in CuIr2Te4.\nIn this work, we prepared the polycrystalline CuIr2-xAlxTe4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.2)\ncompounds successfully by a solid-state reaction method. Our results demonstrate that the CDW order can be completely suppressed within a fine-tuned Al-doped content as a result of the improvement of Tc. Tc initially increases with the rise of doping amount until x = 0.075 and reaches highest value of 2.75 K, eventually forming a dome-phase like electronic phase diagram. The acquisition of the CuIr2-xAlxTe4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.2) system also provides some enlightenment for the search of new superconductors."

            "text": "The PXRD patterns of CuIr2-xAlxTe4 compounds are presented in Fig. 1a. PXRD\nanalysis shows that Al concentration is limited up to 0.2 since Al2Te3 impurity is found with further increasing Al content. As Al doping content increases, the (001) peak moves to the right, which can be verified by the decrease of lattice constants a and c with increasing x (Fig. 1c), reflecting the compression of the CuIr2Te4 unit cell. As illustrated in Fig. 1c, clearly, both lattice constants (a and c) and c/a singly reduce with increasing Al concentration. It is found that a and c reduce from 3.9397(5) and 5.3965 (3) \u00c5 for the pristine sample to 3.9264(1) and 5.3757(2) \u00c5 (x = 0.2) in CuIr2-xAlxTe4, respectively. The detailed refinement of the selected sample CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 is displayed in Fig. 2a. Most of the diffraction peaks have been indexed in terms of trigonal symmetry with a space group P-3m1 (No. 164) and some small peaks indexed\nfor tiny unreacted Ir are also detected. The illustration shows that the disordered trigonal structure, in which the Cu is inserted between two-dimensional (2D) IrTe2 layers, Ir partial substituting by Al simultaneously (see Fig. 2b and 2c).\nTable 1. Tc and RRR of CuIr2-xAlxTe4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.2) compounds. The Tc is determined by using\nThe temperature-dependent normalized resistivity (\u03c1/\u03c1300K) of the CuIr2-xAlxTe4 (0\n\u2264 x \u2264 0.2) compounds is exhibited in Fig. 3a. Besides, our previous finding indicates that there is no structure transition for the pristine sample. Thus, we propose that the normalized resistivity with cooling and heating exhibited a distinct hysteresis associated with the formation of CDW-like transition for the pristine CuIr2Te4 sample. It is worth mentioning that no signature of the abnormal hump can be observed above Tc in \u03c1/\u03c1300K of the Al doping samples CuIr2-xAlxTe4 (0 < x \u2264 0.2), indicating the CDWlike transition can be suppressed with subtle Al substitution for Ir, companying with the increment of Tc. The resistivity data for Al-doped samples show a metallic behavior.\nWe can observe sharp drops of \u03c1(T) for the CuIr2-xAlxTe4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.15) below 3.0 K (see Fig. 3b), which represent the outset of the superconducting state. The transition width of Al-doped compounds is much narrower than that of the pristine CuIr2Te4. The Tc and residual resistivity ratio (RRR = R(300K)/R(3K)) of CuIr2-xAlxTe4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.2) samples summarized in Table 1. As Al content increases, both Tc and RRR increase to the highest value at x = 0.075, then decrease for further Al doping. For 0.075 \u2264 x \u2264 0.5, the RRR value sharply decreases form 4.44 for x = 0.075 to 2.342 for x = 2.34. This phenomenon indicates that high Al content induces significant disorder in the polycrystalline CuIr2-xAlxTe4 series.\nthe highest Tc in detail, we have measured the resistivity under various applied magnetic fields. Tcs shift to lower temperature with the increasing applied field (see in Fig. 3c). The upper critical field \u03bc0Hc2(0) is obtained from Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WWH) and Ginzburg-Landau (GL) models. The upper critical field \u03bc0Hc2(T) values of CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 at zero temperature can be extrapolated by GL formula using the data deriving from 10, 50, and 90 % criteria of \u03c1N (normal-state resistivity). The GL\nformula is shown as follows: \ud835\udf070Hc2=\ud835\udf070Hc2(0)* 1-(T/Tc)\n2\n1+(T/Tc) 2 .\n[47] The \u03bc0Hc2(0) values of\n0.235, 0.250, and 0.255 T for CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 can be determined using the data 10, 50 and 90 % criteria of \u03c1N, respectively. Furthermore, we can acquire \u03bc0Hc2(0) values of 0.180, 0.191, and 0.193 T for CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 corresponded to the data 10, 50, and\n90 % criteria of \u03c1N, respectively, via using the WHH formula \u03bc0Hc2 = -0.693Tc dHc2\ndTc for\nthe dirty limit SC. [48] The slopes, dHc2/dT, are obtained from linear fitted CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 sample for data 10, 50 and 90 % criteria of \u03c1N. Additionally, we fit the Pauli limiting field (0HP(T)) by the formula 0HP (T) = 1.86Tc, which is shown in Table 2. Then, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \u03beGL(0) can be derived from this\nequation \u03bc 0 Hc2(T) =\n0\n2\u03c0\u03beGL 2 , where o represents the flux quantum. For example, \u03beGL(0)\nof CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 is calculated to be 40.4 nm via using 50 % criteria of \u03c1N data based on WHH model. Table 2 summarizes all the relative experimentally measured and estimated parameters.\nThe superconducting transition has also been confirmed by the magnetic\nsusceptibility data (Fig. 4a) with strong diamagnetic signals under zero-field-cooling (ZFC) mode. The superconducting volume fraction of the CuIr2-xAlxTe4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.15) compounds can be calculated around 95 %, which manifests high purity of the polycrystalline CuIr2-xAlxTe4 samples. Next, we examine the lower critical fields (\u03bc0Hc1) by the field-dependent magnetic susceptibility M(H) measurements in a temperature range between 2 - 2.6 K. Fig. 4b presents the magnetization (M-H) curves at different temperatures below Tc of the representative CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4. As shown in the purple line in Fig. 4b, the M(H) isotherms show a linear relationship with the magnetic field (H) at low magnetic fields, indicating it is a type-II superconductor. We can extract the\ndemagnetization factor (N) values following the expression: N = 4\u03c0\u03c7 V + 1 , where\n\u03c7 V\n= \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc40\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3b represents the linearly fitted slope. The calculated N value for\nCuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 is about 0.53. We can use the expression Mfit = m + nH to fit the experimental data at low magnetic fields, where m represents the intercept and n stands for the slope of linear fitting from the low magnetic field M(H) data. The inset of Fig. 4c displays the (M - Mfit) data vs. H. Then, we can fit the \u03bc0Hc1(T) by the expression\n\u03bc0Hc1(T) = \u03bc0\ud835\udc3bc1\n\u2217 (\ud835\udc47)\n1 \u2212 N , where \u03bc0Hc1\n* is the intersection point between the M - Mfit vs. H\ncurves and the field (purple line in the inset of Fig. 4c), which deviates by \u223c 1 % above the fitted data (Mfit) as customary. The temperature dependence of \u03bc0Hc1(T) for CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 is displayed in the main panel of Fig. 4c. Consequently, we can\nfurther acquire the \u03bc0Hc1(T) using the equation \u03bc0Hc1(T)=\u03bc0Hc1(0)(1-(T/Tc) 2 ) . The\nestimated \u03bc0Hc1(0) at zero temperature of CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 sample is 0.060 T, which is larger than that of undoped parent sample (see in Table 2).\nTo further convince that SC is essential feature of the highest Tc compound\nCuIr1.925Al0.075Te4, we also perform the temperature-dependent specific heat measurement. Fig. 5 illustrates the detailed characterization of the superconducting transition in the highest Tc composition CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 through specific heat measurements under absence of magnetic field. The data Cp/T vs. T 2 can be fitted by the equation Cp = \u03b3T + \u03b2T 3 above the Tc to acquire the value of \u03b2 and \u03b3 is 2.20 mJ mol \u22121 K\u22124 and 12.12 mJ mol\u22121 K\u22122 for CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4, respectively, where \u03b3T represents the sum of electron contributions (Cel.) to the specific heat and \u03b2T 3 is the sum of phonon contributions (Cph.). Fig. 5b shows the sum of electron contribution to the specific heat at the temperature near the Tc under 0 T, where Cel. is easily derived from deducting the phonon part: Cel. = Cp - \u03b2T 3. Apparently, a sharp specific heat jump occurs in our representative CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4, characteristic of bulk SC. The Tc further can be determined to be 2.70 K using the common equal-area entropy construction method, which agrees well with those observed in magnetization and resistivity tests. Based on\nthe Tc and \u03b3 values, we can determine \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59.\n\u03b3\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 = 1.53, which is slightly larger than the\nvalue of 1.43 forecasted by the BCS theory, revealing its superconducting nature. The\nDebye temperature obtained using the equation \u0398D = (12\u03c0 4nR/5\u03b2)1/3 is 183.5(1) K, where R represents the gas constant, n expresses the number of atoms per formula unit. The resultant electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bbep value further estimated by introducing the \u0398D number into the inverted McMillan\nequation: \u03bbep= 1.04+\u03bc* ln( \ud835\udee9\ud835\udc37 1.45Tc )\n(1-0.62\u03bc*) ln( \ud835\udee9\ud835\udc37\n1.45Tc )-1.04\n[49] for CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4 is 0.66. Following the\nformula N(EF) = 3\n\u03c02kB 2 (1+\u03bbep)\n\u03b3, the \u03bbep and \u03b3 values can give rise to the electron density\nof states (DOSs) around the Fermi level (N(EF)). The obtained N(EF) = 3.13 states/eV f.u. for CuIr1.925Al0.075Te4, greater than that of pristine CuIr2Te4 ((N(EF) = 3.10 states/eV f.u). The enhancement of Tc may be accompanied by the increment of the DOS states at the Fermi energy in CuIr2-xAlxTe4 systems. As show in Fig. 5b, the specific heat data can be basically fit with the equation Cel. = A exp (-\u2206/(kBT)). Due to the limitation of experimental conditions, the specific heat measurement did not measure the lower temperature region. Nevertheless, the R2 value of 0.9998 shows that the data and the calculated curve are reasonably consistent.\nFinally, to further understand the effect of Al dopant on the CDW and SC of\nCuIr2Te4, the electronic phase diagrams plotted Tc versus Al-content x have been established (see Fig. 6). All the Tc values were obtained from the resistivity and magnetization tests. From Fig. 6, we can find that the CDW order is immediately suppressed while Tc increases with increasing Al content up to x = 0.075 and rises towards the highest value 2.75 K at x = 0.075. From this, we find that despite subtle Al is instead of Ir, it has a strong impact on the SC and CDW. Besides, in contrast to our previously reported system Ru/Ti-doped CuIr2Te4, the similarity is the destabilization of CDW upon small amount doping concentration no matter Ru, Ti, or Al as dopants and formation of dome-shape like superconducting phase diagrams. [32,33] Despite overall similarities, there are significant differences between the CuIr2-xRuxTe4, CuIr2xTixTe4, and CuIr2-xAlxTe4 systems. Substitution of Ir by Ru or Ti in CuIr2Te4 corresponds to a \u201chole\u201d (p-type) doping of the IrTe2 layers, while partial doping Al into Ir site in CuIr2Te4 is an electron (n-type) doping. As for the high-Tc cuprate superconductors, where the competition between anti-ferromagnetism and SC develops as a function of chemical doping, the evolving balance between competing electronic orders in CDW/SC systems is one of their most fundamentally tempting properties. In our case, the bands in the neighborhood of the Fermi energy EF of the pristine sample CuIr2Te4 mostly come from Ir d and Te p orbitals and locate at a flat plateau, in which Al doping acts as a chemical pressure, closing the gap on the Fermi surface that usually leads to rapid suppression of CDW. On the other hand, the increase of band filling of the Fermi surface under chemical pressure could be the mechanism of the promotion of SC. But further study and evidence need to be collected to find out the competition between CDW and SC."
