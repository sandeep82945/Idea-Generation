INTRODUCTION\nAs the Arctic undergoes rapid environmental changes, it attracts the attention of scientists from various fields, including underwater acousticians. Acoustical methods of underwater sensing play an important role in exploring and monitoring the under-ice (underwater) environment.1,2 Moreover, the dramatic melting of Arctic ice opens the way for expanding oil and gas industry activities in that region, which can raise the underwater noise level.3 The main concern is the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on marine mammals.\nIn 2016 and 2017, a set of yearlong, deep and shallow water experiments, known as CANAPE and SW CANAPE, was conducted in the Canada Basin and on the Chukchi Shelf. In the experiments, the huge temporal variability of acoustic receptions was detected both during deep-to-shallow water sound propagation2 ( 60 dB at 200\u2013300 Hz) and only shallow water propagation1 ( 20 dB at 700\u20131100 Hz). This was attributed mainly to a specific hydrodynamic regime. The water depth along the acoustic tracks was 100 to 3800 m, and sound propagation was mainly in the subsurface duct. Therefore, studying the influence of the bottom on acoustic propagation conditions was not the main objective of the experiments.\nOur paper is focused on the effect of spatial variability of bottom parameters on sound propagation in the Russian\npart of the Arctic Shelf. Seventy percent of this region has a water depth of less than 50 m. Thus, the propagation conditions should be strongly dependent on seabed characteristics there. Due to the lack of full-scale acoustic experiments, the investigation is carried out within numerical simulations. However, the most detailed information on seabed structure is taken as an input for the simulations.\nThe upper layer of the Artic shelf\u2019s bottom consists of unconsolidated sediments that are known to be highly inhomogeneous.4 There are layered series of deposits up to tens of kilometers long, narrow vertical channels linked to natural gas emission with pockmarks (craters) at the water\u2013 bottom boundary, diapir-like structures (dome-shaped folds occurring in highly plastic rocks), and paleo river valleys filled with a material with properties different from those of outer deposits. Consequently, an upper sedimentary layer is a medium with a spatially varying acoustic impedance Z1 \u00bc c1q1=\u00f01\u00fe ia1=2\u00de from the standpoint of physical acoustics, where c1, q1, and a1=2 are the local values of the sound speed, density, and loss tangent, respectively. When shear waves are present, an additional impedance Z1s \u00bc c1sq1= \u00f01\u00fe ia1s=2\u00de should be incorporated, where c1s and a1s=2 are the local values of the shear wave speed and loss tangent, respectively. Generally, spatial distributions of these acoustic characteristics are unknown. Therefore, in shallow-water acoustics, the seabed is often modeled as a homogeneous fluid with certain constant effective parameters: the compressional wave sound speed ceff1 , the density q eff 1 , and the compressional wave loss tangent aeff1 =2: Furthermore, there is another scenario in which the sea bottom is represented as an unconsolidated or consolidated sediment layer lying on a)This paper is a part of a special issue on \u201cOcean Acoustics in the Changing Arctic.\u201d b)Also at: Bauman Moscow State Technical University, Moscow, 105005, Russia.\nJ. Acoust. Soc. Am. 151 (4), April 2022 VC 2022 Acoustical Society of America 22970001-4966/2022/151(4)/2297/13/$30.00\n18 January 2024 21:27:09\nan elastic half-space.6\u20139 In this situation, the effective parameters of compressional waves are added to the effective shear wave speeds and attenuation coefficients in the layer and half-space, as well as the effective compressional wave speed and density in the half-space. The effective parameters are commonly accepted as the values for which the simulated transmission loss in the water layer correspond to the experimental one. More complex depth and range-dependent models of the seabed have been produced in recent decades.10,11\nIn the Russian part of Arctic shelf, the local sound speed c1 and the local density q1 at the bottom possibly have the most variability. Recent studies in the Laptev Sea have revealed12 an alternation of frozen (permafrost), thawed, and gas-saturated bottom areas with wide-ranging probable values of c1 and q1. In this region, the sound speed c1 in sediments is often less compared to the sound speed c in water.\nThe dependency of the compressional sound speed c1 on the spatial coordinates can now be measured owing to advances in the velocity analysis of three-dimensional (3-D) seismic survey data.13 New tasks in the study of rangedependent acoustic wave propagation in shallow-water locations can be addressed if a seismic survey is simultaneously followed by core sampling with successive density analysis. It is possible, for example, to accurately predict transmission loss for a given set of ranges and azimuths.14 Other prospective uses include the investigation of normal mode interference and coupling induced by bottom inhomogeneities, as well as the investigation of acoustic wave horizontal refraction caused by similar inhomogeneities.15\nHowever, the compressional wave loss tangent a1=2 related to the attenuation of acoustic waves in sediments cannot be estimated employing 3-D seismic survey data. In this regard, the sound attenuation coefficient in the bottom can only be chosen from literature data. Furthermore, there is a wide range of possible values for this coefficient.16\nThis research investigates numerically the twodimensional (2-D) and 3-D sound propagation in shallow water of about 30 m in depth with an extensive inhomogeneous seabed in one of the regions of the Kara Sea. One of the region\u2019s most distinctive features is the presence of areas where c1 c. There is every reason to believe that such areas are a common feature of the Arctic shelf.\nThe present paper supplements and summarizes the results of previous studies.17\u201319 The normal mode method, augmented with quasi-modes,20 is applied to the sound propagation problem in a range-dependent environment. In the near-field, adding quasi-modes, which rise exponentially with depth, provides for a more accurate solution.21 Why not use an approach based on parabolic equations (PEs)? First, a normal mode approach can facilitate the interpretation of the acoustic data. The computational burden, on the other hand, may be higher. Second, this method makes it easier to solve 3-D problems, for example, employing the adiabatic mode PE solution.22\nThe numerical model of the seabed is based on the experimental data gathered during 3-D seismic surveys and\ndrilling on the compressional sound speed c1\u00f0x; y; z\u00de and density q1. The findings of the core analysis are insufficient for compiling the spatial distribution of q1. Consequently, in the numerical simulation, the density q1 is considered to be range and depth independent, and equal to the mean value recorded at a single location. Another assumption is that the attenuation coefficient in the seabed b1f (b1f dB=km=Hz\u00bd \u00bc 27:3a1=c1 km=s\u00bd ) depends on frequency with b1f \u00bc 1:07 10 4f 1:6 [dB/km/Hz]23 (frequency in Hz), which is a constant for all ranges and depths. (This dependence corresponds to the experimental values obtained for the eastern shallow water part of the Barents Sea.24) Shear waves are neglected owing to the fluid nature of the sediments in the region.\nAll computations are performed for the ice-free summer-fall season, when the water layer is well-mixed and homogeneous, with a constant sound speed c and density q. It was during this time that the seismic survey was conducted. Generally, the sound speed c can depend on the depth z, and the gradient of the vertical sound speed profile can change from noticeable negative values in summer to positive values in winter. However, additional simulations indicate that the qualitative features of sound propagation and attenuation would remain true even if c z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc const is chosen. When there is ice cover in winter25 or wind-driven surface waves in summer,26 the depth-averaged transmission loss increases. The purpose of this paper is to draw the reader\u2019s attention to the effect of bottom inhomogeneities on sound propagation and to rule out other variables. The sound field is calculated for a range up to 10 km and low frequencies (137 and 250 Hz), which are critical for determining marine mammal safety zones in the Arctic.3,9\nThis paper is organized as follows: Sec. II presents and discusses 3-D seismic survey data for the Kara Sea. In Sec. III, a sound field in a shallow water acoustic waveguide with an inhomogeneous bottom is studied using an adiabatic normal-mode approximation reinforced by quasi-modes. Section IV presents numerical simulation findings for four acoustic tracks in the Kara Sea using an adiabatic approach. Section V develops coupled mode equations for both normal and quasi-modes. Section VI shows the solution to these equations as well as the entire acoustic field for an acoustic track with the maximum horizontal gradient of the bottom sound speed. In Sec. VII, horizontal refraction of acoustic waves induced by bottom inhomogeneities is examined employing the adiabatic mode PE. Section VIII contains the conclusion.\nII. 3D-SEISMIC SURVEY DATA FOR THE KARA SEA\nThe 3-D seismic data for the south part of the Kara Sea represents the sound speed field in the seabed c1 x; y; z\u00f0 \u00de as a function of Cartesian coordinates. The sound speed field17 was extracted by geologists from the raw seismic data using a standard method.27 The relative accuracy of sound speed estimates by this method is about 1%. In our numerical model, the coordinate system \u00f0x; y; z\u00de has its origin in the\n2298 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 151 (4), April 2022 Petnikov et al.\n18 January 2024 21:27:09\nupper sea surface, and the z-axis is directed vertically downwards. The z-axis has a resolution of 4 m, while the x- and y axes have a resolution of 100 m. The water depth in the area under consideration ranges from 25 to 50 m. Figure 1 shows the horizontal and vertical (along the dashed line A in Fig. 1(a) slices of the sound speed field, which demonstrate a considerable degree of inhomogeneity of the bottom sediments. In Fig. 1(a), the horizontal slice corresponds to a depth of 53 m. As demonstrated by the dotted line in Fig. 1(b), the water\u2013bottom interface is horizontal at a constant depth of 28 m.\nIn Fig. 1, notice the dark zones in the seabed, which are apparently associated with high gas emissions from deeper layers. Here, the bottom sound speed is close to that of water (1460 m/s). Figure 1(b) also shows the presence of a transitional layer with a thickness of approximately 10 m just below the water\u2013bottom interface. This layer has a positive sound speed gradient and covers the entire area. The sound speed gradually increases from the sound speed in water to the value in deeper layers.\nThere are two reasons for the presence of the low sound speed transitional layer in the upper sediments in areas where deep gas emissions are not observed.28 The first is a postcryogenic gas, which is formed during the decomposition of local organic materials. Second, there is a watersaturated silt, which has a similar sound speed to water.\nTo examine the above-mentioned reasons, let us consider Fig. 2, which shows the sound speed and bottom density profiles for the same vertical line. The small black circle in Fig. 1(a) represents the location of this line. The mean sound speed profile for this location is shown in Fig. 2(a). Note the constant sound speed of 1460 m/s in the water column. The thick solid line in Fig. 2(b) displays the mean density profile at a depth of 27\u201340 m, whereas the gray region represents the 95% confidence interval. The profile is obtained by analyzing bottom cores from 16 boreholes, distributed almost uniformly in a 300 300 m square. [In Fig. 1(a), the center of the square corresponds to the center of the small black circle.] The total number of cores was 358. The vertical step in the study ranged from 0.2 to 2.2 m with a mean step of 0.8 m. The deepest borehole reached a depth of 65 m. The thin dashed line in Fig. 2(b) depicts the density profile for this borehole.\nIn Fig. 2(b), the thick dashed line shows the theoretical density profile, which was calculated from the sound speed profile [Fig. 2(a)], assuming the absence of gas in the bottom. For the calculation, the empirical formulas devised by Akal29 for the sound speed and density in the sea bottom were employed. Specifically, the equation c1 \u00bc cw 1:631\u00f0 1:78j\u00fe 1:2j2\u00de was solved to obtain the porosity j. The equation has only one root that is less than 0.9 for typical values c1 and cw. Only such root (the porosity value) has physical meaning. The root was then substituted into the relation for density q1 \u00bc qw 2:604 1:606j\u00f0 \u00de, where cw \u00bc 1460 m/s and qw \u00bc 1 g/cm3 are the sound speed and density in water, respectively. The analytic formulations for a two-component media (water \u00fe solid particles) agree well with these formulas.30\nIn the absence of gas, a monotonic rise in density with depth in the upper sediments corresponds to a monotonic increase in sound speed, according to Akal\u2019s formulas (see Fig. 2). The actual density of the bottom [the solid line in Fig. 2(b)] is, on the other hand, nearly constant, with a depth-averaged value of 1.85 g/cm3. As a result, the twocomponent media model is inadequate, and the subsurface sediment layer should be regarded as a three-component media, containing gas. Furthermore, as depth increases, gas saturation drops, resulting in an increase in sound speed. This argumentation should be considered only as a plausible explanation. Numerical estimates31 show that the sound speed in porous bottom sediments is close to the sound speed in water, if the volume gas fraction has an order of 10 6. Direct measurement of such a low gas concentration in the seabed is a challenging task."

Quasi-modes are a type of\nleaky modes that grow exponentially in the lower halfspace.32 By including quasi-modes in the summation in Eq.

Since the use of standard normal mode codes can lead to errors, finding a solution to the Sturm\u2013Liouville problem [Eq.

Second, the complex bisection algorithm is applied to refine the values of nm: Note that eigenvalues nm change their locations depending on the position along an acoustic track in a waveguide with an inhomogeneous bottom. Figure 4 shows the range dependences of real and imaginary parts of nm along Track #4 [see Fig. 1(a)] at a frequency of 250 Hz.

In Fig. 1(a), the tracks are represented by black segments that are numbered from 1 to 4. Tracks #1, #2, and #3 are positioned in places with vertical sound speed profiles in the seabed that are roughly range-independent, but these profiles change from one track to the next.\nThe vertical sound speed profiles along Tracks #1 to #4 are shown in Fig. 5. The sound speed at the bottom c1 for Track #1 is close to the sound speed in water c. Sound speed c1, for Track #2 on the other hand, greatly surpasses c. The seabed along Track #3 is comparable to Track #2, but with lower c1 values. The first half of Track #4 is placed in the region where c1 c, and the second half is located on the part where c1 > c, demonstrating a very range-dependent inhomogeneous seabed.\nJ. Acoust. Soc. Am. 151 (4), April 2022 Petnikov et al. 2301\n18 January 2024 21:27:09\nFor Tracks #1, #2, and #4, the water layer thickness is constant at 28 m; for Track #3, it is 32 m. A white dotted line depicts the water\u2013bottom interface in Fig. 5. The sound speed in water, c and density of water, q are 1460 m/s and 1 g/cm3, respectively.\nThe bottom density in the simulations was q1 \u00bc 1.85 g/cm3. The homogeneous bottom begins at a depth of H1 \u00bc 64 m. Additional calculations have shown that inhomogeneities below this depth have no effect on the pressure field in the water column.\nThe sound source frequencies (f \u00bc 137 and 250 Hz) chosen for the simulation correspond to the maxima in the spectra of some marine animals in the Arctic shelf. These protected species are bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), respectively. The sound source is located approximately in the center of the water layer at a depth of z0\u00bc 15 m. Note that the attenuation curve produced by Eq. (8) has a weak dependence on a source depth for z0 from k to \u00f0H k\u00de; where k is an acoustic wavelength.9\nFigures 6(a)\u20136(d) illustrate the attenuation curves for Tracks #1 to #4 and frequencies 137 and 250 Hz, as determined by Eq. (8). A sound source is located at the leftmost position on each track. A receiver, which measures the depth-averaged intensity, is moved away from the source rightwards, so that the source-receiver distance changes in the range of r0 r 5 km, where r0 \u00bc 100 m. In practice, a vertical array of hydrophones spanning the whole water column with a spacing of k=2 can play the role of a receiver measuring the depth-averaged intensity. The discrete mode spectrum, which includes quasimodes, adequately describes the pressure field starting at r0 \u00bc 100 m. Figures 6(e) and 6(f) show attenuation curves in the circumstance where the sound source is at the far right end of Track #4 and the receiver is shifted from right to left (dashed lines). The attenuation curve simulated for such a configuration will be referred to as Jinv\u00f0r\u00de hereafter. Let us highlight the key characteristics of sound attenuation as shown in Fig. 6.\nFIG. 4.

An anomalous high attenuation occurs when the mean sound speed in the seabed c1 approaches the sound speed in water (Track #1), which is a distinctive feature of specific areas of the Arctic shelf. When c1 is significantly less than c (by more than 100 m/s) in the case of a soft bottom, the attenuation curves exhibit lower transmission loss for the lower mean sound speed c1: However, we were unable to locate information on such low c1 values in the Arctic shelf seabed. 33 (2) The attenuation curves for majority of the tracks (Tracks\n#2, #3, and #4) indicate higher transmission loss as the frequency increases, which is explained by the frequency dependence of the attenuation coefficient in the seabed b1f . The only exception is Track #1, where\nc1 c. However, additional calculations have shown that anomalous sound attenuation always occurs at c1 c; regardless of the chosen frequency dependence of b1f. In this scenario, all or almost all of the normal modes are leaky and carry away acoustic energy from the water column. (3) For r > 1 km, the functions J r\u00f0 \u00de are close to linear, and for r < 1 km, irregular oscillations are observed. For f \u00bc 137 Hz, the slope of attenuation curves ranges from 1.5 to 20 dB/km, whereas for f \u00bc 250 Hz, the slope ranges from 2 to 10 dB/km. Track #1 at f \u00bc 137 Hz [Fig. 6(a)] and Track #4 at backward propagation [Figs.\n6(e) and 6(f)] had the maximum slope variability.\n(4) The attenuation curves in Figs. 6(e) and 6(f) show\nalmost equal transmission loss at a distance of 5 km for forward (from left to right) and backward (from right to\nFIG. 6.

Note that the orthogonality condition in form of Eq. (11), as well as the corresponding eigenfunction normalization condition at m\u00bcn, is generic for normal modes and quasi-modes.\nWe use Eq.

This approach is also applicable for waveguides with c1 < c or c1 c, where all (or nearly all) modes are leaky, and the contribution of quasi-modes (belonging to leaky modes) may be significant. In the absence of MC, all the coefficients Vmn are equal to zero. In this case, we return to the adiabatic propagation and formula in Eq. (9) becomes the formula in Eq.

The most intense coupling can be observed between mode #1 and mode #2, mode #1 and mode #3, or mode #1 and mode #8 at a frequency of 250 Hz depending on the position along the track.

            "text": "Consider the effect of MC on the total acoustic field along Track #4. The water depth is assumed to be constant, and the water\u2013bottom interface is flat and smooth. A point sound source is located at a depth of 15 m, and the attenuation curves are determined employing Eqs. (8) and (9) as in Sec. IV. When MC is included, the resulting attenuation curves are identical to those obtained employing the AA in Sec. IV. This implies that AA works well for transmission loss prediction in a waveguide with an inhomogeneous seabed when a point sound source is employed. However, there is a circumstance in which this method is only partially accurate. For example, let us consider the situation of one mode excitation. If there is only mode #2 at the beginning of the track, it will transfer some energy to mode #1 due to bottom inhomogeneities. Since mode #2 has a higher attenuation than mode #1, it will result in a reduction in transmission loss.\nNotice that if mode #1 is the only excited mode initially, the effect of MC will be negligible as in the case of a single source.\nThe radiation of a single mode #2 can be modeled by setting the initial conditions for the system [Eq. (12)] in the form Cm 0\u00f0 \u00de dm2. To track the behavior of coupled modes, the attenuation curves for separate normal modes are calculated as\nJm r\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 10lg Im r\u00f0 \u00de I r0\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 10lg r r0 ; (17)\nwhere Im r\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2qcH\u00f0 \u00de 1 \u00d0H 0 Pmj j2dz, Pm is the complex amplitude of mode m, defined in Eq.

The MC is more evident for sound propagation from an area with low sound speed at the bottom, c1 c, to a region with higher sound speed than that for sound propagation in the opposite direction. The reciprocity does not apply here because both the sound source and receiver are not point ones. (2) The MC influence depends on the sound frequency. This\neffect is stronger at lower frequencies. For example, at 250 Hz, the deviation of MC solution from AA solution is evident starting from the range of 2.5 km (forward propagation). At 137 Hz, that range is 1 km. This can be elucidated by a deeper sound penetration into sediments at lower frequencies. (3) Figure 9 shows that the difference in attenuation curves\nat MC and AA is due to the presence of mode #1, which has the lowest attenuation and dominates the total field at a distance.\nA long vertical array of sound sources spanning the entire water column and a portion of the seabed to a depth greater than the acoustic wavelength k1 at the bottom is required for pure single-mode excitation.18 Hence, a single-mode excitation is difficult to implement in an experiment.\nWe emphasize that MC induced by seabed structure features is considered for an area where the bottom sound speed is close to the sound speed in water, and the large fraction of sound can penetrate deep into the seabed. For example, the mode #2 (absolute value) at 137 Hz has the maximum in the upper layer of bottom sediments as shown in Fig. 10. In that sense, our scenario is somewhat similar to\nthe situation of MC induced by sound speed anomalies (produced by internal solitary waves35), which are observed not in the bottom, but in the water column."

The reason for horizontal refraction in such a waveguide is that the modal phase speed is dependent on the seabed properties, including the sound speed. When the sound speed in the bottom approaches the sound speed in the water, this dependence is most obvious. In the seafloor, a global minimum of modal phase speed is situated in the area with a low sound speed.19 This may allow for the observation of horizontal refraction or perhaps horizontal ducting.\nConsider the rectangular area of 10 4 km2 shown in Fig. 1(a) by a dashed line. This area has a constant depth of 28 m and is characterized by a strong transverse sound speed gradient in the seabed. The bottom sound speed ranges from 1460 to 1700 m/s, whereas the sound speed in water is constant at 1460 m/s. In Fig. 1(a), an asterisk denotes the location of a sound source. The depth of the source is 15 m. A Cartesian coordinate system \u00f0x0; y0; z0\u00de is introduced to study the normal mode amplitudes in the\nhorizontal plane, with z0-axis pointing downwards. The origin of the system is shown in Fig. 1(a). The x0- and y0axes directions are also shown in Fig. 1(a). In this coordinate system, the sound source is located at the point (0, \u20131000, 15 m).\nTo calculate modal amplitudes in the horizontal plane, we employ a mode PE approach. In the Cartesian system, the pressure field is represented as a sum of local waveguide modes\nP x0; y0; z0 \u00bc XM m\u00bc1 Am x 0; y0 wm z 0; x0; y0\n\u00bc XM m\u00bc1 Pm x 0; y0; z0 ; (18)\nwhere Am x 0; y0\u00f0 \u00de is the complex amplitude of the m-th normal mode, wm z 0; x0; y0\u00f0 \u00de is the local eigenfunction of the m-th mode.

[In contrast to Eqs. (8) and (17), the cylindrical spreading is not compensated.] The acoustic field is effectively formed by three normal modes at this frequency, with mode #1 contributing the most. Figures 11(a) and 11(g) are nearly identical, as can be seen. Figure 11 also includes ray diagrams depicting horizontally refracted mode routes. Notice that the angle of refraction is up to 10 , which is obtained for a waveguide with constant depth and homogeneous water column. The effect of horizontal refraction on modal amplitudes is weak because the modal attenuation which is a dominant factor varied greatly in the region investigated. For example, the attenuation coefficient cm=2 of mode #1 lies in the interval between 0.6 * 10 4 and 1.7*10 3 1/m (0.5 to 15 dB/km).\nThe right column in Figs. 11(b), 11(d), and 11(f) shows the difference DJ m \u00bc J m\u00f0 \u00dePE J m\u00f0 \u00deN 2 D between modal attenuation contours simulated by a mode PE method and Nx2-D approximation. Refraction can cause modal amplitudes to increase by a few tens of dB. The effect of focusing on the low bottom sound speed zone for mode #3 can be seen in Fig. 11(f). In Fig. 11(h), showing the difference DJ \u00bc J \u00f0 \u00dePE J \u00f0 \u00deN 2 D between full-field attenuation contours simulated by PE and Nx2-D, one can note an additional ensonification of the dark zone with high sound attenuation and low sound speed in the seabed. In comparison with the amplitudes of higher modes, the full field does not change very much. These conclusions are supported by additional calculations at a frequency of 250 Hz."

Furthermore, even if there is no bottom roughness, a spatially inhomogeneous seabed affects the propagation of individual waveguide modes.
