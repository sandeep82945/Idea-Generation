ABSTRACT Objectives To investigate the relationship between burnout, emotional labour and psychological resilience of gastroenterology nurses during the COVID19 pandemic and explore the factors associated with these specific variables. Design A multicentre crosssectional study with anonymous selfreporting was conducted from 24 November 2021 to 26 December 2021. Setting The study was conducted in Fujian Province, China. Participants The participants were 345 gastroenterology nurses from 7 tertiary hospitals. Primary and secondary outcome measures Burnout, emotional labour and psychological resilience were the primary outcome measures. Using a convenience sampling method, the data were collected using Questionnaire Star (a tool for questionnaire surveys) via WeChat. The Chinese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Chinese version of the Emotional Labour Scale and the Chinese version of the Psychological Resilience Scale were used to evaluate burnout, emotional labour and psychological resilience, respectively. Results The total scores for burnout, emotional labour and psychological resilience in gastroenterology nurses were 53.07\u00b119.63, 38.79\u00b112.22 and 69.97\u00b122.38, respectively, with less use of deep acting and more use of surface acting. Pearson correlation analysis showed that burnout was positively correlated with two dimensions of emotional labour; surface acting and emotional expression, and negatively correlated with deep acting. There was a negative correlation between emotional labour and all three dimensions of psychological resilience. Conclusions Greater adoption of deep acting by nurses can be promoted by improving their psychological resilience during events such as the COVID19 pandemic, which can help improve emotional labour, thereby reducing burnout and decreasing turnover rates. Senior management in hospitals must pay attention to nurses\u2019 psychological status. Further interventional studies could be conducted in the future to explore relevant measures.",

Falatah4 suggested that the pandemic appeared to have significantly increased the mean rate of nurses\u2019 turnover intention. By the end of 2020, China\u2019s total number of registered nurses (RNs) exceeded 4.7 million, with 3.35 RNs for every 1000 people,5 which is less than the world national average of 3.816 RNs per 1000 people.6\nAccording to Global Cancer Statistics 2020, there are nearly 19.3 million new cancer cases and approximately 10.0 million cancer deaths in 185 countries in 2020. Colorectal cancer (10%) ranks third in new cancer cases and gastric cancer (5.6%) ranks fifth; colorectal cancer (9.4%) ranks second and gastric cancer (7.7%) ranks fourth in the number of cancer deaths.7 Recent study data suggest an increased burden of colon cancer in China and the USA, it is estimated that colon and gastric cancers in China and colon cancer in the USA are covered in the top five cancer\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 This study provides valuable insights into the current state of burn- out, emotional labour and psychological resilience among gastroenterology nurses during the COVID- 19 pandemic. \u21d2 Participating nurses may not be representative of all populations in all countries. \u21d2 Such cross- sectional studies can only imply association, not causation. \u21d2 Nurses were self- selected to participate, exposing the study to selection and response bias. \u21d2 The difficulty of data collection during the pandemic may have led to possible bias in data interpretation.\n(IIT P atna).

Regarding China\u2019s policy response to the COVID- 19 pandemic, nurses in Fujian Province were deployed and involved in epidemic prevention and control in their units as required under the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Controlling the COVID- 19 pandemic remains a significant public health challenge in China. Hospital nurses, as the principal healthcare workers involved in nucleic acid testing for COVID- 19, are often required to undertake such testing. Hospitals play a critical role in combating the epidemic, and its impact on nursing staff permeates their work. Therefore, we investigated the current situation concerning burn- out, emotional labour and psychological resilience among gastrointestinal nurses during the COVID- 19 pandemic. However, the focus in terms of the study population was not on nurses directly involved in caring for patients with COVID- 19.\nAs key healthcare workers in the fight against the pandemic,13 Chinese nurses take care of patients while undertaking various aspects of prevention and control. They are prone to psychological adjustment imbalances because of multiple challenges and pressures. Additionally, studies have shown that providing healthcare affects mental health significantly14 and have emphasised the importance of exploring psychological resilience support for healthcare workers with burn- out.15 The first author of this study has worked in the field of gastroenterology for an extensive period and is very concerned about the psychological condition of gastroenterology nurses. One aim of this study is to prompt future related studies to reduce burn- out, manage emotional labour and improve psychological resilience among gastroenterology nurses.\nJob burn- out, also known as \u2018job fatigue,\u2019 was first discussed by the American psychiatrist Herbert Freudenberger16 in 1974. Maslach and Jackson17 defined burn- out as a syndrome involving excessive physical and mental exertion and energy depletion caused by an individual\u2019s prolonged exposure to stress, also known as burn- out syndrome. An international survey in the USA showed a growing global trend in nurse burn- out,18 which is consistent with the findings of Aiken et al.19 Numerous countries have high rates of burn- out among nurses, such as Japan19 (33%\u201360%), South Africa20 (34.6%) and Spain21 (21%). Moreover, the total burn- out detection rate among Chinese nurses has been reported to be 69.21%.22 Additionally, numerous studies have shown that nurses are at high risk of burn- out.23 High levels\nof emotional exhaustion in response to the COVID- 19 outbreak have been associated with increased work intensity, the tension between doctors and patients, and a lack of communication with managers.24 This situation seriously affects nurses\u2019 physical and mental health and reduces the quality of nursing care.25 Furthermore, Luo et al26 reported a significant correlation between emotional labour and burn- out.\n\u2018Emotional labour,\u2019 first proposed in 1979 by the American social psychologist Arlie Hochschild,27 is a term used about employees who consciously manage their emotions at work and display visible external expressions and body movements to the public.28 Throughout the interdisciplinary literature, emotional labour has two attributes: (1) autonomous or spontaneous emotional expression,29 30 also referred to as an autonomic emotional regulation31 and (2) according to the middle- range theory of emotional labour,32 33 representation of the self as a working persona including both surface acting (ie, expression of superficially felt emotions, including fake, unfelt emotions or suppression of felt emotions)29 30 and deep acting (ie, expression of deeply felt emotions, and modification of felt emotions to match displayed emotions).29 30 34 35 Surface acting is analogous to a nurse\u2019s smile while working in a hospice, in which the nurse seems to care about the patient and tries to match their emotions to the patient\u2019s emotions.36 In contrast, deep acting implies that nurses connect with patients and project themselves therapeutically.36 As their work is emotionally intensive, nurses continually confront and manage the negative emotions of patients and their families.37 Diefendorff et al38 found that nurses were subjected to a higher emotional load. Similar results have been reported in the Chinese context. Numerous studies have shown moderate to high levels of emotional labour in nurses who work in the emergency39 and cardiology departments.40 Frequent and excessive use of emotional labour intensifies nurses\u2019 fatigue and burn- out, which increases their propensity to leave their profession.41 Therefore, it is essential to explore how emotional labour can be properly managed to reduce burn- out.\nPsychological resilience, also known as \u2018mental toughness\u2019 and \u2018bounce- back ability\u2019, is a negative predictor of burn- out in the USA.42 It is the ability to move forward positively from a negative, traumatic or stressful experience.43 In a study supported by the American Association of Critical- Care Nurses, Mealer showed that 22% of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses with high levels of psychological resilience44 tended to exhibit optimism, humour, flexibility and high ethical standards.45 Individuals with higher psychological resilience are better able to deal with stressful situations and, thus, maintain good mental health.46 Along with the rapid development of global healthcare, building the psychological resilience of caregivers has been listed as one of the top ten international \u2018standard of care movements\u2019.47\nAlthough previous studies have explored the relationship between burn- out and emotional labour and between\n(IIT P atna).

Therefore, this study investigated the current status of burn- out, emotional labour and psychological resilience among gastroenterology nurses during the COVID- 19 pandemic, to explore relevant associations among these factors in relation to specific variables, and to provide evidence- based research to help reduce nurses\u2019 burn- out, increase their job satisfaction, and promote their psychological health during the COVID- 19 pandemic.\nMETHODS Patients and public involvement The study did not involve patients. All data for this study were obtained from nurses.

A two- by- two comparison showed that, in terms of forms of employment, category labour contract <permanent staff; in terms of monthly income, less than RMB4000<RMB4000\u2013RMB5999=greater than or equal to RMB6000, as detailed in table 1.\nThe relationship between emotional labour, psychological resilience and burn-out in nurses The relationship between burn-out and emotional labour in nurses The results of the Pearson correlation analysis showed that the nurses\u2019 burn- out was positively correlated with their total emotional labour scores (r=0.386, p<0.001) and that their burn- out was positively correlated with two dimensions of emotional labour, namely, surface acting (r=0.450, p<0.001), and emotional expression (r=0.403, p<0.001) and negatively correlated with deep acting (r=0.303, p<0.001).\nThe relationship between emotional labour and psychological resilience in nurses The results of the Pearson correlation analysis showed that the nurses\u2019 emotional labour was negatively correlated with their total psychological resilience scores (r=\u22120.330, p<0.001) and that their emotional labour was negatively correlated with toughness (r=\u22120.323, p<0.001), self- improvement (r=\u22120.297, p<0.001) and optimism (r=\u22120.332, p<0.001).\nMultiple linear regression analysis of predictors of burn-out, emotional labour and psychological resilience in nurses Multiple linear regression analysis of predictors of burn-out among the nurses The number of days per month working at night and whether they directly supervised nursing interns were predictors of burn- out. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis showed that there was a positive relationship between both these factors and burn- out, as detailed in table 3.\nMultiple linear regression analysis of predictors of the nurses\u2019 emotional labour The nurses\u2019 employment category and marital status were predictors of emotional labour.

            "text": "The objectives of this study were to survey the current status of burn- out, emotional labour and psychological resilience among gastroenterology nurses during the COVID- 19 pandemic, to explore the factors associated with them.\nAccording to the China Health Statistics Yearbook 2020, RNs with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher accounted for 23.8% of nurses, graduate students accounted for only 0.2% and nurses with secondary school education accounted for 26.8%. However, the sites where the data were collected for this study were all tertiary class A hospitals, which recruit nurses with a higher educational threshold, which explains why the percentage of nurses with bachelor\u2019s degrees or higher was 49.0% in this study\n(IIT P atna).

It should also be noted that most of the included nurses with high seniority did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree when they joined the profession. However, in recent years, China has increasingly emphasised the importance of the nursing workforce in terms of policy and encouraged in- service nursing staff to upgrade their education. They also promoted nursing staff to improve their research ability and consequently their ability to care for patients. In response, hospitals have gradually increased their recruitment of bachelor\u2019s degree graduates; however, the finding that half of the nurses still did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree indicates that this commitment to fostering higher levels of education among nurses is an ongoing process.\nThe findings revealed that the total burn- out score of nurses was higher than that of Tian et al,22 which may be explained by that study conducted in 2014, that is, the pre- COVID- 19 period. As nurses working in the fight against the pandemic have worked more than usual during this time, this might have increased their burn- out levels. Many studies have reported varying levels of burn- out among different groups of nurses. Liang et al53 showed that the total burn- out score of ICU nurses was higher than that found in this study, which may be related to factors such as the more severe conditions of ICU patients, more frequent night shifts for nurses, heavier workloads, greater labour intensity and a shortage of human resources. A study by Li54 showed that nurses in intravenous drug administration centres had higher scores on the dimension of emotional exhaustion and lower scores on the dimension of personal fulfilment than in this study, which may be related to the fact that nurses in intravenous drug administration centres are at a higher risk of occupational injury,54 the working environment is more confined, and nurses have less direct contact with patients and family members.\nRegarding emotional labour, the total score found for the nurses was lower than that reported by Wu et al.55 This may be related to the fact that Wu et al surveyed 11 337 nurses from 92 hospitals, most of whom were from hospital emergency and surgery departments, which have a heavier workload and more intense work compared with gastroenterology. This may have increased the level of emotional labour of nurses to some extent. This study suggests that the nurses tended to adopt more superficial play at work; they often engaged in emotional camouflage and only displayed pleasing emotions to patients. To a certain extent, this indicates a poor professional identity among these nurses.26\nIn this study, the psychological resilience scores were higher than those of Afshari et al.56 The reason for this could be the difference in the time of the study surveys being conducted. When the current study was initiated, understanding of the new coronavirus was more significant, as was knowledge among the population concerning the preventive effects of vaccination and how to implement and run vaccination programmes smoothly. Nurses\nhave improved their prevention, control management and response skills, resulting in a relatively higher level of psychological resilience. Therefore, nurses have been able to deal more positively with stress, recover quickly and adapt positively to stress factors.\nThis study showed that nurses who directly supervised nursing interns had higher levels of burn- out, which may be related to the increased teaching workload and the emotional drain. The higher level of burn- out among nurses with a more frequent number of days per month working at night may be related to the increased frequency of changes in work and rest schedules, which would have increased the physiological and psychological burden placed on them. This study showed higher levels of emotional labour among divorced nurses, which accords with the findings of Zhu et al.57 This may be linked to the fact that divorce increases the emotional burden on nurses, alongside work pressure, which renders them more prone to anxiety, sadness and other negative emotions. The lower level of emotional labour and the higher level of psychological resilience found among the nurses on the permanent staff may be related to the fact that nurses on staff are more stable and have a lower turnover rate. The higher level of emotional labour among junior and middle nurses than among the subsenior and senior nurses may be related to the difference in years of experience and heavier emotional load. The monthly income level indicates the value hospitals place on their nurses for their hard work and reflects the level of support given to the nursing department. This level of support has a significant effect on nurses\u2019 psychological resilience; the greater the level of support, the higher the overall level of nurses\u2019 psychological resilience.58\nThis study showed that nurse burn- out was negatively correlated with the deep acting dimension of emotional labour and was positively correlated with the other two dimensions, which accords with a previous study.26 With developing awareness among increasing numbers of individuals in medicine, patients are paying more attention to their medical experience, and patient satisfaction has become an important criterion for measuring the level of medical care, which requires nurses to have advanced levels of competence in handling the nurse\u2013 patient relationship. As shown in Brotheridge nd Lee,59 the behaviour of showing emotions that are inconsistent with one\u2019s actual inner experience weakens one\u2019s sense of self- worth, and this process requires more psychological resources for nurses to show appropriate emotional behaviour. Excessive consumption of physical and mental resources over a long period can easily lead to psychological fatigue, thus aggravating emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation. In contrast, deep acting means that nurses can adjust their genuine feelings and understanding to adapt to the situation, and such behaviour of aligning internal feelings with external emotional performance appropriately consumes less physical and mental resources. However, individuals do not need to require more resources to suppress their true emotions,\n(IIT P atna).

A study by Wang et al60 concluded that the more nurses express their emotions authentically, the more committed they are to their work.\nThis study showed that nurses\u2019 emotional labour was negatively related to psychological resilience and its three dimensions. From this study\u2019s results, it would appear that nurses who show more resilience, self- improvement and optimism are more likely to adopt deeper roles in their work and have a higher sense of professional identity. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the psychological well- being of nurses and increase their psychological resilience during the COVID- 19 pandemic and other similar events. Some studies have shown that mindfulness- based stress reduction and psychotherapy centred on positive thinking can help reduce nurses\u2019 workload stress, help them establish a healthy psychological state,61 and improve their levels of psychological resilience.62 Studies have shown that surface acting negatively correlates with job satisfaction, while deep acting has a positive relationship with job satisfaction.55 This study\u2019s results suggest that, by improving nurses\u2019 psychological resilience, nurses can be encouraged to engage in more deep acting, which is likely to help increase nurses\u2019 professional identity and job satisfaction.\nThis study provides valuable insights into the current state of burn- out, emotional labour and psychological resilience among gastroenterology nurses during the COVID- 19 pandemic. However, the study has several limitations. First, the findings are cross- sectional, precluding the drawing of any conclusions about the impact of COVID- 19. Comparison of the findings with prepandemic studies requires caution, as the observed status may be due to factors unrelated to the pandemic. Second, this study was only conducted in one province of China using a convenience sampling method, which is not representative of other regions, or of departments and other personnel in hospitals, meaning that these findings are not generalisable. Third, as 98.8% of the participants were female, more attention should be paid to male nurses in the future. Fourth, the difficulty of data collection during the pandemic may have led to possible bias in data interpretation. In addition, the scope of one questionnaire may not be sufficient to summarise nurses\u2019 actual levels of burn- out, emotional labour and psychological resilience. Given the possibility of a \u2018social desirability\u2019 effect, nurses\u2019 self- reported burn- out may be lower. Therefore, actual burn- out may be higher than the reported results, which would reduce the reliability of the results of this study. The response rate was relatively good, although approximately a quarter of the participants did not respond. As not responding may be a sign of burn- out, this study might have underestimated the prevalence of burn- out among the study population."

            "text": "This study was conducted during the COVID- 19 pandemic to investigate whether the pandemic impacted the psychological state of nurses in relation to burn- out, emotional labour and psychological resilience and to provide guidance for subsequent burn- out prevention and control efforts. Greater adoption of deep acting by nurses can be promoted by improving their psychological resilience, which can help improve emotional labour, thereby reducing burn- out and decreasing turnover rates. Senior management needs to pay attention to the psychological status of nurses. Therefore, qualitative, longitudinal and interventional studies should be conducted to explore the psychological condition of nurses, expand the research indexes of nurses\u2019 psychological characteristics, construct models of nurses\u2019 psychological resilience, and further track the long- term effects of interventions while evaluating the immediate effects of interventions.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank all the participants for their cooperation and the nursing management staff of the cooperative hospitals for their support in this study.\nContributors HL and ZL contributed equally to this study.
