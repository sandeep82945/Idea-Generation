    "abstractText": "Given the current epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs to combat drug-resistant tuberculosis. Direct inhibitors of the InhA target do not require activation and thus can overcome drug resistance caused by mutations in drugactivating enzymes. In this work, the binding thermodynamic and kinetic information of InhA to its direct inhibitors, phenoxyphenol derivatives, were explored through multiple computer-aided drug design (CADD) strategies. The results show that the van der Waals interactions were the main driving force for protein\u2013ligand binding, among which hydrophobic residues such as Tyr158, Phe149, Met199 and Ile202 have high energy contribution. The AHRR pharmacophore model generated by multiple ligands demonstrated that phenoxyphenol derivatives inhibitors can form pi\u2013pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions with InhA target. In addition, the order of residence time predicted by random acceleration molecular dynamics was consistent with the experimental values. The intermediate states of these inhibitors could form hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with surrounding residues during dissociation. Overall, the binding and dissociation mechanisms at the atomic level obtained in this work can provide important theoretical guidance for the development of InhA direct inhibitors with higher activity and proper residence time.",

            "text": "The enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) is a key enzyme in catalyzing fatty acid synthesis, which is essential for the survival of mycobacteria. Studies have shown that inhibiting the function of InhA protein will block the synthesis of mycolic acid, thereby destroying the formation of bacterial cell walls and further leading to morphological changes and cell lysis [1]. As prodrugs, isoniazid and ethionamide are activated by KatG/EthA to form adducts with NADH, and then the adduct acts on InhA to inhibit its protein function [2,3]. However, mutations in the KatG/EthA genes confer severe resistance to isoniazid and ethionamide [4]. In contrast, the direct inhibitors of InhA can skip the drug activation step and avoid the drug resistance problems. Therefore, the study of direct inhibitors against InhA target has attracted widespread interest. In recent years, a series of phenoxyphenol derivatives designed based on the antibacterial drug triclosan (TCL) showed high binding affinity to InhA [5\u20137]. In particular, the derivatives have longer residence time than TCL and can act on the InhA target for a long time [6,8]. Additionally, some direct inhibitors, including thiazoles, pyridines and carboxamides [9\u201311], etc., have also been discovered through high-throughput screening\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 10102. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms231710102 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 10102 2 of 14\nand fragment-based drug design. Unfortunately, none of the inhibitors have entered clinical studies. So, it is very meaningful to understand the interaction essence between InhA and its direct inhibitors to provide the valuable information of future design and modification of InhA direct inhibitors. In modern drug discovery, accurate evaluation of thermodynamic and kinetic information of drug\u2013target interactions can provide a useful theoretical basis for understanding how drugs and their targets interact and how to improve drugs\u2019 efficacy [12,13]. With the development of computer-aided drug design (CADD), the binding free energy [14\u201316] and residence time [17,18] of protein\u2013ligands can be accurately predicted by computational methods. Compared to traditional experiments, CADD strategy is more time-efficient, labor-saving and cost-effective, allowing the prediction of thermodynamic and kinetic information for many molecules in a short period of time. In this paper, the binding thermodynamics of TCL and its five derivatives (PT70, PT91, PT119, PT501 and PT506) with InhA was first explored by classic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The binding free energy calculated by the molecular mechanics\u2013generalized Born surface area (MM\u2013GBSA) [19] showed that these inhibitors bound to InhA mainly through the van der Waals interaction. Residue energy decomposition revealed that residues such as Phe149, Tyr158, Met199 and Ile202 had higher energy contributions to the binding of inhibitors. In addition, the conformation of the substrate binding loop (H6) and H7 directly affected the binding affinity of the inhibitors. Secondly, pharmacophore model analysis further showed that the common structural features of this class of inhibitors include a hydrogen bond acceptor group, a hydrophobic group and two aromatic centers. The results of tau random accelerated MD (\u03c4RAMD) [18] simulations indicated that the six inhibitors mainly have two different dissociation pathways, and the predicted order of residence time was consistent with the experimental order. Meanwhile, steered MD [20] simulations further characterize the intermediate states of each inhibitor during the dissociation process."

            "text": "The root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) value can be used to examine the deviation between the target coordinate set and the reference coordinate set during the simulation process, which reflects the positional change of the molecular structure over time. The fluctuations of RMSD can also characterize the stability and convergence of the system. Here, the RMSD values of protein and ligand over time were monitored during the simulation. It can be seen from Figure 1A that after 150 ns, the protein RMSD fluctuations in each system were all within 1.0 \u00c5, indicating that the system tended to be stable. As shown in Figure 1B, all ligands were also relatively stable after 50 ns (fluctuated within 1.0 \u00c5). The RMSD of TCL changed greatly at about 30 ns (from 1.0 \u00c5 to 8.0 \u00c5), which indicated that the binding position of TCL may have changed. In addition, the root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) of proteins were also monitored. From Figure 1C, we can see that among the six systems, the H6 and H7 were more flexible than the other domains. The \u03b1-helix of H6 and H7 are located around the binding pocket, which directly affects the stability of inhibitor binding. The flexibility of H6 and H7 was the smallest in PT70 system, which may be the reason for the best binding affinity of PT70. To predict the binding affinity between these inhibitors and InhA, the equilibrated trajectories were used to calculate the binding free energies by the MM\u2013GBSA method. As shown in Table 1, the binding free energies of PT70, PT91, PT119, PT501, TCL and PT506 to InhA were \u221232.84 kcal/mol, \u221232.23 kcal/mol, \u221232.27 kcal/mol, \u221232.09 kcal/mol, \u221228.34 kcal/mol and \u221228.11 kcal/mol, respectively.

As shown in Figure 2, the residues with large energy contributions mainly included Phe149, Tyr158, Met161, Met199, Ile202 and Leu218. To analyze the relationship between the residue energy contribution and the binding mode, principal component analysis was performed, and the free energy landscapes were plotted based on the top two principal components (Figure S1). It can be seen that the conformational distribution of each system was relatively concentrated, tending to form a single conformational state. The structures located at the lowest energy well were selected as the representative conformations of each system and the detailed binding modes between\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 10102 4 of 14\nthem and InhA were shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that the residue Tyr158 can not only form pi\u2013pi stacking with the benzene rings on TCL and PT501 molecules, but also form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on PT70 and PT91 molecules. Therefore, the interaction between the residue Tyr158 and the inhibitor is very important for the binding of inhibitors. Moreover, the benzene rings and hydrophobic tails of TCL, PT70, PT91 and PT119 can also form van der Waals interactions with residues Phe149, Phe97, Met103, Met155, Tyr158, Met161, Met199 and Ile202. In the PT501 system, the N atom of the triazole ring can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor to form a hydrogen bond with Gln214. The triazole and cyclopropane substituent of PT501 protruded into the hydrophobic pocket formed by Met155, Leu217, Ile202, Ala157 and Pro156 (Figure 3E). The above residues were also critical to the binding of PT501 and InhA (Figure 2). The triazole ring of PT506 can form pi\u2013pi stacking interaction with Phe149. In addition, the triazole ring and cyclopropane substituents also extended into the hydrophobic pocket formed by Met199, Val203, Leu218, Met155, Trp222, Ile202 and Pro193.\nInt. J. Mol.

            "text": "InhA Inhibitors\nTo further identify hotspot residues for the binding of these inhibitors to InhA, residue energy decomposition was carried out. As shown in Figure 2, the residues with large energy contributions mainly included Phe149, Tyr158, Met161, Met199, Ile202 and Leu218. To analyze the relationship between the residue energy contribution and the binding mode, principal component analysis was performed, and the free energy landscapes were plotted based on the top two principal components (Figure S1). It can be seen that the conformational distribution of each system was relatively concentrated, tending to form a single conformational state. The structures located at the lowest energy well were selected as the representative conformations of each system and the detailed binding modes between them and InhA were shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that the residue Tyr158 can not only form pi\u2013pi stacking with the benzene rings on TCL and PT501 molecules, but also form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on PT70 and PT91 molecules. Therefore, the interaction between the residue Tyr158 and the inhibitor is very important for the binding of inhibitors. Moreover, the benzene rings and hydrophobic tails of TCL, PT70, PT91 and PT119 can also form van der Waals interactions with residues Phe149, Phe97, Met103, Met155, Tyr158, Met161, Met199 and Ile202. In the PT501 system, the N atom of the triazole ring can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor to form a hydrogen bond with Gln214. The triazole and cyclopropane substituent of PT501 protruded into the hydrophobic pocket formed by Met155, Leu217, Ile202, Ala157 and Pro156 (Figure 3E). The above residues were also critical to the binding of PT501 and InhA (Figure 2). The triazole ring of PT506 can form pi\u2013pi stacking interaction with Phe149. In addition, the triazole ring and cyclopropane substituents also extended into the hydrophobic pocket formed by Met199, Val203, Leu218, Met155, Trp222, Ile202 and Pro193.\nFigure 2.

Compared to PT70 system, the \u03b1-helix structure of H6 was converted into a loop structure in the TCL system, and the helix structure of H7 also underwent a conformational change. The binding conformation of PT91 was similar to that of PT70, with both their hydrophobic tails extending to the hydrophobic sub-binding pocket above. However, the \u03b1-helix of H6 in the PT91 system was also converted to a loop structure, which increased the flexibility of the binding pocket and reduced the binding affinity of PT91 to InhA. In the PT501 system, the conversion of the helix structure of H6 and H7 to loop was more obvious. Additionally, we found the binding conformations of cyano substituents of PT119 and PT506 were similar. The conformations of H6 and H7 in both PT119 and PT506 systems underwent large shifts, which ultimately exposed their binding pockets to solvent, thereby reducing their binding stability to InhA."

It can be seen from Table S1 that the number of dissociated trajectories of TCL according to path1, path2 and path3 were 50, 69 and 1, respectively. It can be speculated that TCL is relatively small and can dissociate from both path1 and path2 channels (Figure 5B,C). For the PT70, PT91 and PT501, their main dissociation pathways were mainly according to the path1 channel, while PT119 and PT506 were mainly along the path2 channel (Table S1 and Figure S3). Int. J.

The residence times of TCL, PT91, PT70, PT119, PT501 and PT506 predicted by \u03c4RAMD were 33.9 ps, 91.4 ps, 177.4 ps, 386.5 ps, 518.9 ps and 2529 ps, respectively. Compared to the experimental value, the predicted residence times were much shorter (only at the ps level) due to the applied external force in \u03c4RAMD. However, the order of the predicted residence times of the six molecules was consistent with the order that was measured experimentally. In addition, \u03c4RAMD also predicted the residence time of TCL that cannot be experimentally monitored due to its too-fast dissociation. From the predicted residence time, we found that inhibitors containing cyano substitutions have longer residence times, such as PT119 and PT506. Through the analysis of the binding mode, we found that the N atom of the cyano group of PT119 and PT506 can form hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of the pyrophosphate region of NADH (as shown in Figure S4), which was not shown in PT70, PT91 and PT501 systems. Therefore, PT119 and PT506 required longer time to overcome the hydrogen bonds between them and NADH during the dissociation process. Therefore, the cyano group substitution may prolong the residence time of the molecule, which is information that can guide the design of the inhibitor of InhA with long residence time.\nFigure (A) Schematic di gram of three possible dissociation pathways (path1 to path3).

During the simulations, the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm [35] was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions, and the SHAKE algorithm [36] was used to limit the vibrations of all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. A structure was saved every 5 ps. Each system contains approximately 110,000 atoms."

In this work, the pharmacophore models based on multiple ligand (6 inhibitors studied in this paper) were constructed by Schr\u00f6dinger 2021 [21]. In addition, the discriminative ability of the pharmacophore model was also evaluated. The active set contained 13 active phenoxyphenol derivatives listed in literature [37] (not the same as the studied 6 inhibitors). The decoy set (including 2300 compounds) was downloaded from the DUD\u2013E (Directory of Useful Decoys) [38]. Next, parameters such as phase hypo score, ROC (receiver operating characteristic), EF1% (enrichment factors) and AUC (area under the curve) were used to evaluate the pros and cons of the model. A pharmacophore model with a higher AUC value can more accurately find active inhibitors from the screened compounds."

In this paper, the \u03c4RAMD simulations were performed in NAMD program [40]. Firstly, 10 ns conventional MD simulations were performed to generate different initial structure and velocity for \u03c4RAMD simulation. Six structures were extracted from the trajectory (one frame every 2 ns) for \u03c4RAMD simulations. In addition, the magnitude of the random force was set to be 16 kcal/mol. To increase the repeatability of the simulations, 20 parallel dissociation simulations (with random force direction changes) were performed for each structure. Finally, a total of 120 dissociation trajectories were obtained for each system."

The results showed that when the elastic coefficient was set to 20 kcal/mol\u00b7A\u22122 (taking the PT70 system as an example), the requirement of a hard spring can be achieved (Figure S5). In addition, other systems also meet the hard spring requirement at a stretching speed of 0.0008 \u00c5/ps and an elastic coefficient of 20 kcal/mol\u00b7A\u22122 (Figure S6).

MM\u2013GBSA is one of the important methods to calculate the binding free energy between proteins\u2013ligands [41]. The basic principle of MM\u2013GBSA is as follows:\n\u2206Gbind = Gcomplex \u2212 Greceptor \u2212 Gligand (1)\nwhere \u2206Gbind is the binding free energy. Gcomplex ,Greceptor and Gligand represent the free energies of complex, protein and ligand, respectively, which can be estimated by the following equations:\nG = Egas + Gsol \u2212 TS (2)\nGsol = GGB + GSA (3)\nGSA = \u03b3\u00d7 SASA + \u03b2 (4)\nwhere Egas is the gas\u2013phase energy. Gsol is solvation free energy, which can be calculated by solving the GB equation [42]. GSA was estimated by the solvent-accessible surface area [43] determined using a water probe radius of 1.4 \u00c5.

            "text": "In this work, the multiple strategies (including classic MD simulation, MM\u2013GBSA, pharmacophore model, \u03c4RAMD and steered MD simulation) were employed to investigate the binding thermodynamic and dissociation kinetics information of TCL and its five derivatives (PT70, PT91, PT119, PT501 and PT506) to InhA. The obtained results indicated that the residues such as Phe149, Tyr158, Met161, Met199 and Ile202 had high energy contributions to the binding of inhibitors. Compared with the PT70 system, the larger conformational changes in the \u03b1-helical structures of H6 and H7 in other systems increased the flexibility of the pocket and exposed the binding pocket to solvent, thereby reducing the binding affinity of the inhibitors. Furthermore, the pharmacophore model revealed that the active phenoxyphenol derivatives generally contain aromatic centers, hydrophobic\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 10102 12 of 14\ncenters and a hydrogen bond acceptor. The result also indicated that the aromatic centers and hydrophobic centers of these inhibitors can form pi\u2013pi stacking interaction with Tyr158, Phe149 and van der Waals interactions with other hydrophobic residues of InhA. Although the oxygen atoms and hydroxyl substituents on the inhibitors could form hydrogen bonds with InhA, the hydrogen bond strength was relatively weak. Therefore, it can be considered to extend the substituent side chain and add more polar groups to establish stronger hydrogen bond interactions. In addition, the dissociation pathways and residence times of these inhibitors were also predicted by \u03c4RAMD simulations. The results of \u03c4RAMD simulations showed that the two main dissociation channels were path1 (along the H7 direction) and path2 (along the H6 direction). Furthermore, the order of the predicted residence times of the inhibitors by \u03c4RAMD simulation was consistent with the experimental order. The steered MD simulations also identified that hydrophobic interactions (such as with Phe149, Met155, Tyr158, Ile202, Val203 and Leu207, etc.) and some hydrogen bond interactions (such as TCL and Met103, PT70 and Pro156, as well as PT91 and Gln214 residues) played important roles in the dissociation process. In conclusion, this work can deepen our understanding for the binding mode and dissociation process of InhA with phenoxyphenol derivatives. At the same time, the identified hotspot residues of InhA and the structural motif of phenoxyphenol derivatives inhibitors can also provide important guidance for the development of inhibitors in the future.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms231710102/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Q.Z. and H.L. designed the research and wrote the manuscript.
