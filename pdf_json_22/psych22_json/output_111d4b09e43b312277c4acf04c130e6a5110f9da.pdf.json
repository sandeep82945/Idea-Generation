Unprecedented government measures brought massive shifts in teaching-learning pedagogy in nursing to curb the infection. The study was conducted to explore the predictors of pandemic fatigue among nursing undergraduates and mediating role of individual resilience and coping styles during the third wave in India.\nMethods: This online survey included 256 undergraduate nursing students studying at Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital in North India. Lockdown/Pandemic Fatigue Questionnaire, Brief Resilience Scale, and Coping Behavior Questionnaire were used to collect the information. Appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to compute the results.\nResults: Nursing undergraduates reported a moderate level of fatigue during the restrictions imposed at the time of the third wave. Students\u2019 year of study (p = 0.001), tested positive during pandemic (p = 0.003), and post-COVID-19 hospitalization (p = 0.026) were found associated with higher fatigue status. Advanced age (p = 0.046) and higher personal resilience status (p < 0.001) were associated with lower fatigue levels. Resilience status (\u00df = \u2212 4.311 p < 0.001) and second year of study (\u00df = 3.198, p = 0.015) were reported as independent predictors of pandemic fatigue in students.\nConclusion: Findings suggest that lockdown-related fatigue was common in nursing undergraduates. Considering negative consequences on mental health, routine psychosocial screening of the nursing students should be\u00a0conducted. Recommending stress-relieving measures should be\u00a0enforced to help nursing undergraduates to combat lockdown-induced exhaustion.\nKeywords: COVID-19, nursing, students, coping, resilience, fatigue\nINTRODUCTION\nThe COVID-19 pandemic cases were detected in Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei province for 2 years (Aslan and Pekince, 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic was declared a global threat and significantly impacted each area of life, including health and economics (Labrague and Ballad, 2021). Every government has taken unprecedented measures to control further transmission, including\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 August 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 940544\nmandatory lockdown, strict social distancing, frequent handwashing, and mandatory home quarantine or isolation after traveling to other parts or another country (Dharra and Kumar, 2021).\nIn India, the government imposed a countrywide lockdown and a partial lockdown named \u201cnight curfew\u201d since the pandemic, forcing people to stay at home, reducing social interaction and physical activities, and leaving them with many psychosocial issues (Kumar et\u00a0 al., 2021). In addition, medical schools around the globe were also shut down before the pandemic reached on peak and left the students amid course completion dilemmas (Harries et\u00a0 al., 2021). However, government mitigating measures, including lockdown and social distancing, helped slow down the transmission of the virus but adversely affected the physical and psychological health and wellbeing of all categories of people, including nursing students (Labrague and Ballad, 2021).\nMedical and nursing staff always take the forefront of any particular pandemic or outbreak and risk their lives. They are more prone and vulnerable to getting infection considering close contact with the infection, high stress, lack of rest, and extended duty hours in the hospital (Luberto et\u00a0 al., 2020). Extending course deadlines and duration might further intensify the stress and anxiety among nursing students (Huang et\u00a0 al., 2020). The changes in teaching-learning pedagogy and curriculum delivery of the nursing students might be\u00a0expected to intensify students\u2019 stress further. In addition, changes in the routine of academic, social restriction, and lifestyle behavior might negatively impact psychological wellbeing (Aslan and Pekince, 2021). Sadly, many health professionals lost their lives while providing care to patients with coronavirus at the hospital in the ongoing pandemic\u2014every new strain of virus hammering the mental health of everyone and creating more panic among health professionals (Aslan and Pekince, 2021).\nResilience is a personality trait that helps an individual become strong and bounce back during a stressful situation or help to cope with adverse conditions (Hamadeh Kerbage et\u00a0 al., 2021). A higher resilience will help adapt to a stressful situation and help deal with mental, emotional, and educational challenges. Earlier literature reported the importance of resilience, ineffective adjustment, improving social relationships, social support, and psychological wellbeing (Yu et\u00a0 al., 2019). Indeed, resilience is considered one of the critical personality attributes affecting the retention of nursing students in their studies (Moloney et\u00a0 al., 2018).\nEvidence shows that health professionals and university college students reported a higher incidence of psychological stress than the general population (Luberto et\u00a0 al., 2020). These students are more vulnerable to developing emotional problems, anxiety, stress, and depression considering fear of failure, time crisis, session duration change, exam pattern and timing, neglected self-care, and social restrictions to meeting family and friends (Dyrbye and Shanafelt, 2016; Yu et\u00a0 al., 2019). Huge uncertainties and confusion about the fixed deadline for the pandemic left the students with many questions related to their career selection and future (Agu et\u00a0 al., 2021). Still, there is no light on the other side of\ndark tunnels, and experts speculate vividly to end this pandemic.\nTherefore, there is a pressing need to explore predictors of pandemic fatigue and understand the mediating role of resilience and coping on health after 2 years of the pandemic in nursing undergraduates."

The mean age of the students was 21.27 years, with a standard deviation of 1.19 years. All the students were female, considering the admission to female students in the institute. A more significant number of students were from the second year (34.3%), followed by the third year (33.5%) and fourth year (32.3%). Since there was no admission for the new batch due to an ongoing pandemic, there was no participation from the firstyear students. 39.3% of students were deployed as bed nurses during the pandemic and had experience as bedside nurses in the hospital. 11.3% of students were hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19 (10.1%) during the ongoing pandemic.\nFurther, more than three fourth of students underwent quarantine (78.6%), with a mean duration of 13.27 days of quarantine. Sadly, 5.8% of students lost one of their family members in the pandemic after getting COVID-19. The mean scores for the coping and personal resilience measures were 18.74 (SD: 5.60) and 3.02 (SD: 0.42), respectively (Table\u00a0 1).\nTable\u00a0 2 shows the students\u2019 responses on the lockdown/ pandemic fatigue scale. The mean fatigue scale score was 31.16 (SD: 7.05) out of the maximum possible score of 50. An independent sample t-test shows a significantly higher mean score (p = 0.026) on the fatigue scale for students deployed as bedside nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic than another group.

This can be\u00a0 interpreted that higher class students might be\u00a0 experienced enough to handle patients in clinical after their earlier class experiences and hence reported lower fatigue scores compared to second-year students who are a novice and directly deployed to the clinical areas in a serious pandemic situation. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient showed a significant negative relationship between age (r = \u22120.125, p = 0.046) and personal resilience status (r = \u22120.286, p = <0.01), and lockdown fatigue. However, coping styles showed a positive relationship with lockdown fatigue (r = 0.161, p = 0.010; Table\u00a0 2).\nFindings revealed that a few of the items, \u2018I worry a lot about my personal and family\u2019s safety during this pandemic\u2019 (m = 4.25), \u2018I have felt sad and depressed as a result of the pandemic\u2019 (m = 3.67), and \u2018I frequently felt weak or tired as a result of the pandemic\u2019 (m = 3.24) reported more frequently by the participants. On the contrary, a few items that received lower attention were \u2018I have difficulty falling or staying asleep over thinking about this pandemic\u2019 (m = 2.58), \u2018I have been losing my interest in doing the usual things I\u00a0 love\u2019 (m = 2.60), and \u2018I have been experiencing headaches and body pains\u2019 (m = 2.61). Further, looking at the agreement status to fatigue items showed that 91.8% of participants responded that they are worried about personal and family members in the pandemic. Likewise, around two-thirds of the participants (74%) reported feeling depressed and sad during the pandemic, and more than half of the participants (52.5%) felt irritated by a pandemic or its related consequences (Table\u00a0 3).\nVariables that showed a significant association with lockdown fatigue were entered into the multiple linear regression model. The model explained 16.8% in the variance of the lockdown fatigue, which was statistically significant (F = 7.170, p = <0.001), which indicated the model fit the variables. Out of inserted variables in the model, personal resilience and the second year of the study predicted lockdown fatigue among participants. This can be\u00a0 interpreted as those students who are studying in the lower class (\u03b2 = 3.198, p = 0.015) and had poor resilience status (\u03b2 = \u22124.311, p = <0.001) reported higher fatigue during the ongoing pandemic (Table\u00a0 4)."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The current digital survey was conducted to study the pandemic fatigue and the influence of nursing undergraduates\u2019 sociodemographic variables, coping styles, and resilience in mediating fatigue during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between February and May 2021. The government has taken unprecedented measures to curb the further infection of different variants of the COVID-19 virus from time to time. Further, the authors presumed that the sudden shifting of traditional classroom teaching and clinical learning to virtual learning coupled with home or hostel confinement and reduced physical activities during the COVID-19 pandemic might lead to more fatigue in nursing students (Liu et\u00a0 al., 2021). In the certain phase of the pandemic, nursing students are confined in the\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 August 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 940544\nhostel or wherever they are, which further intensifies many psychological problems, including anxiety, depression, and fatigue (Brooks et\u00a0 al., 2020). Heavy clinical load, daily infection precautionary measures at work and hostel, reduced social connections, and social distancing could lead to mental fatigue, anxiety, frustration, and boredom (Brooks et\u00a0 al., 2020; Chao et\u00a0 al., 2020; Morales-Rodr\u00edguez, 2021).\nParticipants\u2019 mean fatigue score was 31.16 (SD: 7.05), indicating moderate fatigue status during the ongoing pandemic. A crunch of studies used the lockdown/pandemic fatigue scale; hence, authors find it challenging to compare these findings. However, our study results are in line with a study conducted (Labrague and Ballad, 2021) at Muscat, Oman, on college students who used the pandemic fatigue scale (PFS) reported a similar level of fatigue (31.54; SD: 6.93) during the pandemic. Further, a Chinese study (Liu et\u00a0 al., 2021) reported that more than 67.3% of nursing students said fatigue which is almost doubled (36%) to work conducted (Geiger-Brown et\u00a0 al., 2012) on nurses working in different shifts using the Occupational Fatigue Exhaustion Recovery Scale. Our findings are in consensus with the work (Teng et\u00a0 al., 2020), who reported fatigue in 73.7% of frontline healthcare workers during an initial COVID-19 outbreak in China as measured by the Fatigue Self-Assessment Scale (Teng et\u00a0 al., 2020). These results further follow another work from Australia; a few months after lockdown, the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire reported a significant level of fatigue (Nitschke et\u00a0al., 2021). Shreds of evidence from the United\u00a0States, Saudi\u00a0Arabia, and India report a substantial amount of tiredness, and increased fatigue, boredom, worry, and loneliness, suggesting some efforts to support the affected population to combat the adverse effect of prolonged lockdown, confinement, and other confinement measures imposed by government time to time (Majumdar et\u00a0 al., 2020; Meo et\u00a0 al., 2020). In contrast, medical students\u2019 fatigue status was relatively low (13.8%) before the COVID-19 outbreak (Abdali et\u00a0 al., 2019). Owing to different measurement tools on fatigue between different studies across the globe indicates cautious interpretations and extrapolating of the findings. Considering the negative impact of fatigue on the individual\u2019s physical, mental, cognitive, and behavioral functions (Trendall, 2000), it is imperative to devise support or other stress-relieving strategies to benefit mental health.\nThe symptoms of fatigue among nursing undergraduates, lack of concertation, irritation, disturbed sleep, feeling depressed and emptiness, and tired are other symptoms reported by the students. These symptoms are in line with the earlier Indian work conducted on professionals and students who reported various indicators of symptoms, including anxiety, higher stress, feeling of sleeplessness, depression, a safety concern for family, tiredness, and worry for personal safety and other physical discomforts, during the lockdown (Majumdar et\u00a0 al., 2020). The reported fatigue symptomatology in this study was similar to the report of the symptoms presented by Australian Psychological Society (2020), which reported a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, physical exhaustion, fear, anxiety, emotional outburst, reduced motivation, depression, and difficulty in focusing and problem-solving as a typical array of symptoms of lockdown fatigue.\nStudents\u2019 year of study, COVID-19 positive status, and post-COVID-19 hospitalization directly impacted the development of lockdown fatigue. In particular, final-year and third-year students reported lower lockdown fatigue than second-year students. These findings are anticipated, as, during the study, students will be\u00a0exposed to different clinical conditions and environments to develop positive temperament and adaptive behavior to work with different kinds of patients, which help a student to further deal with such kind of disastrous conditions (Benner, 2004; Sonika and Kumar, 2019). The present study\u2019s findings of lower stress among the higher level of education are also in consensus with the previous studies conducted on nursing students (Kumar and Nancy, 2011; Dharra and Kumar, 2021). Furthermore, previous work on stress among nursing students showed a declining trend as they progress to higher studies, similar to the present report (Kumar and Nancy, 2011; Forn\u00e9s-Vives et\u00a0 al., 2016). These findings of higher stress in lower-class students indicate developing an evidence-based support system through evidence-based intervention to assist budding nurses in developing coping strategies and adaptative resilience to deal with such disastrous situations effectively.\nFurther, regression analysis findings showed a significant negative association of personal resilience with lockdown fatigue, suggesting a protective role of individual resilience against the negative consequences of restrictions faced during mandatory home isolation or quarantine during the pandemic. These study findings align with the earlier work that reported a significant negative relationship between personal resilience and lockdown fatigue in college students (Labrague and Ballad, 2021). Close similar findings presented in earlier work reported a positive impact of personal resilience on improving mental health and psychological outcomes among different populations around the globe (Tsay et\u00a0 al., 2001; Charuvastra and Cloitre, 2008; Ran et\u00a0 al., 2020). The study findings draw the mentor and teachers\u2019 attention to building resilience as a strategy to help a student bounce back from such adversity and traumatic situations. To our current knowledge, this is the first of its study in the area, highlighting the impact of individual resilience and coping styles on combating negative consequences on mental health associated with a pandemic, hence supplementing the existing knowledge in this area of research.\nStudents who used higher coping styles showed higher lockdown fatigue in the current study. Previous studies on nursing students also have identical findings for a significant correlation between fatigue and nursing students\u2019 coping (Nurhidayati et\u00a0 al., 2021). Likewise, another study reported a significant relationship between coping mechanisms and fatigue, suggesting a positive impact of coping mechanisms on fatigue during adverse situations (Michalec et\u00a0 al., 2013). In contrast, the findings on the relationship between coping and fatigue are in non-accordance with many previously published studies that reported a negative relationship between coping mechanisms and fatigue (Tugade and Fredrickson, 2004; Cao et\u00a0 al., 2020; Tull et\u00a0 al., 2020). These contentious findings on coping and fatigue provide additional knowledge to understand the precise\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 August 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 940544\nmediating effect of coping mechanisms in acute and chronic adversity, including the current pandemic. Instead, higher coping use in students might help reduce fatigue and other mental health issues, including irritation, sleeplessness, distraction, sadness, and body aches compared to students not or less use of coping strategies as mentioned in earlier research (Labrague and De los Santos, 2020; Labrague, 2021; Roberts et\u00a0 al., 2021). However, authors speculate the use of a different tool and longer duration of a pandemic for such unforeseen results on the relationship between coping and fatigue. However, it is vital to devise strategies to improve resilience and coping mechanisms among nursing students to maintain and improve their mental health and overall psychological well-being."

            "text": "The study should be\u00a0 appraised under many limitations, and other researchers should be\u00a0 cautious while interpreting and extrapolating the results. First, the cross-sectional nature of the survey impedes computing the exact relationship between different variables, including fatigue, coping, and resilience. It is difficult to interpret from the study that higher resilient and coping mechanisms students have lesser fatigue during the lockdown in comparison to counterparts. Hence, the authors recommend using different study designs, including randomized controlled trials or case\u2013control studies, to understand the mediating effect of resilience in improving fatigue and coping skills in students. Second, a study with a higher sample size is recommended to enhance generalizability over other similar populations. Third, online surveys carry inherent bias, including social-desirability bias, and need caution to interpret the findings."

Further, the junior students reported tested positive and were hospitalized during the pandemic reported higher fatigue than their counterparts. The study reported that senior students with higher resilience levels said lower fatigue, indicating the significance of perceived professional self-confidence and the need for preparation and precautions to take in a disease outbreak. These findings also reflect the necessity of developing\njunior students\u2019 professional competencies and patient handling. However, a structured curriculum and adequate clinical exposure will train the students in developing professional competencies and patient handling skills."
