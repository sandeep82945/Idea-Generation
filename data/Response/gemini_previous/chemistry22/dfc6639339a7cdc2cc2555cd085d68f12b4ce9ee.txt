1. **Investigate the effects of the identified vitamins on MCM7 expression and activity in cancer cells.** This could be done by treating cancer cells with the vitamins and then measuring MCM7 expression and activity levels. This would help to confirm the role of the vitamins in inhibiting MCM7 and provide more evidence for their potential as cancer therapeutics.


2. **Study the effects of the vitamins on cell cycle progression and proliferation.** Since MCM7 is involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression, it would be interesting to see how the vitamins affect these processes. This could be done by treating cells with the vitamins and then measuring cell cycle progression and proliferation rates. This would help to determine if the vitamins can inhibit cancer cell growth by interfering with the cell cycle.


3. **Explore the potential of the vitamins to overcome drug resistance.** Drug resistance is a major challenge in cancer therapy, and it would be valuable to investigate whether the vitamins can overcome drug resistance. This could be done by treating cancer cells with the vitamins in combination with chemotherapy drugs and then measuring the response of the cells. This would help to determine if the vitamins can improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and make it more effective against drug-resistant cancer cells.


4. **Investigate the safety and efficacy of the vitamins in animal models of cancer.** Before the vitamins can be tested in clinical trials, it is important to evaluate their safety and efficacy in animal models of cancer. This could be done by administering the vitamins to animals with cancer and then measuring the effects on tumor growth and survival. This would help to determine the optimal dose and schedule of administration for the vitamins and provide more evidence for their potential as cancer therapeutics.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vitamins in cancer patients.** Once the vitamins have been shown to be safe and effective in animal models of cancer, they can be tested in clinical trials to evaluate their safety and efficacy in cancer patients. This would involve administering the vitamins to cancer patients and then monitoring their response to treatment. This would help to determine the effectiveness of the vitamins in treating cancer and provide more evidence for their potential as cancer therapeutics.
