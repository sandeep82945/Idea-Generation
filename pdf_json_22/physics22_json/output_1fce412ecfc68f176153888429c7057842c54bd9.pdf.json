Whether degenerate codes also obey such a bound, however, remains a long-standing question with practical implications for the efficacy of QECCs. We employ a combination of previously derived bounds on QECCs to demonstrate that a subset of all codes must obey the quantum Hamming bound. Specifically, we combine an analytical bound due to Rains with a numerical bound due to Li and Xing to show that no ((n, K, d)) code with d < 127 can violate the quantum Hamming bound.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe field of quantum computation has recently exploded with a wide range of exciting results regarding the practical applicability of quantum algorithms and the ability to realize ever-growing quantum processor sizes [1]. Naturally, meaningful large-scale realizations of quantum algorithms depend on the ability to achieve fault tolerant computation [2].\nUnfortunately for this endeavor, it is extremely difficult to implement quantum circuits with fidelities large enough to achieve useful computational tasks [3]. Environmental noise and imperfect physical implementations of unitary gates lead to errors, which tend to propagate and grow throughout circuits [4].\nVarious methods have been developed to render functional and scaled up quantum circuitry possible in spite of this noise [5]. Error correction requires redundantly encoding information to ensure that it is fully recoverable after being damaged by some particular set of errors. Quantum error correction is a general and robust method for reducing the effects of noise [6, 7]. An ((n, K, d)) quantum error-correcting code (QECC) is a K = qk dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space of n q-level particles that is characterized by its distance d, the largest integer such that the code can detect any error that acts non-trivially on\n\u2217 e-mail: dallas@usc.edu \u2020 e-mail: fandread@usc.edu \u2021 e-mail: lidar@usc.edu\nat most d\u2212 1 such particles [8]. The most common case is q = 2, where each particle is a qubit. In recent years, there has been significant progress in experimentally realizing many-qubit quantum error correction [9\u201315].\nFor a given quantum information processing task, it would be desirable to maximize both the rate k/n and the distance d of the QECC one selects. In order to guide these efforts, it is imperative to have an understanding of the space of possible codes in terms of the parameters ((n, K, d)). Since the advent of quantum error correction, there has existed an active field of research devoted to obtaining bounds on achievable codes for the parameter space of ((n, K, d)) [16]. Such bounds quantify the inevitable tradeoff between the rate and the distance.\nThe quantum Hamming bound (QHB) is one such bound known to be satisfied by nondegenerate codes, which are codes for which linearly independent errors map the codespace to linearly independent subspaces [17]. It is currently unknown for what set of degenerate codes the QHB holds. Some results have shown violations of Hamming-like bounds for various codes [18\u201323] (which do not immediately bear a clear resemblance to the QHB), but others conjecture that the QHB holds for all quantum codes [24, 25]. Various methods have been employed to calculate constraints on n and d values for which the QHB may be violated [24, 26\u201328]. Degenerate QHB-violating codes could be of great practical importance since they would more efficiently correct errors (achieving the same k, d for a lower n \u201ccost\u201d). However, research on the topic has ar X iv :2\n20 8.\n11 80\n0v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 3\nD ec\n2 02\n2\nprogressed little in recent years. Most of the results have been negative, reducing the range of ((n, K, d)) values for which codes may exist that would violate the QHB. In this work we contribute to this effort by combining an analytical bound derived by Rains [26] with novel calculations of a numerical bound derived by Li and Xing [27], to show that no ((n, K, d)) code can violate the QHB for d < 127.\nIn section II, we introduce the statement of the QHB and describe the intuition behind its derivation. In section III, we introduce the key bounds we employ in this paper. In section IV, we combine these bounds to derive the impossibility of QHB-violating codes of distance d < 127. Finally, we outline possible extensions of this work."

Here, n corresponds to the number of physical q-level particles and the codespace HC comprises k encoded particles. Vectors inHC correspond to code states. The state \u03c1 of the quantum system is a positive semidefinite, unit trace element of the space of bounded linear operators acting onH (\u03c1 \u2265 0, Tr[\u03c1] = 1, \u03c1 \u2208 B(H)).\nHenceforth, unless otherwise noted, we consider only binary codes in this work, i.e., codes defined over qubits (q = 2) as opposed to q-dimensional systems with q > 2. Much of the theoretical background we present is easily generalizable to the higher-dimensional setting (e.g., see section III B), but our numerical results hold only for q = 2.\nFor an arbitrary quantum circuit, let N be the completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) map representing the noise process. We may writeN in the Kraus operator sum representation (OSR) [29] as\nN (\u03c1) = \u2211 j Ej\u03c1E\u2020j , (2)\nwhere {Ej} is a set of linearly independent \u201cerror operators\u201d corresponding to different possible errors acting on the system of qubits [30]. For a system of n qubits, we may represent the Ej in the n-qubit Pauli basis, spanned by operators of the form \u220fnm=1 \u03c3 im m , where im \u2208 {x, y, z, 0} and \u03c30 \u2261 I, the identity operator. An error of weight w is one in which im 6= 0 on strictly w of the n qubits. A\ndetectable error is an error Ej which maps every state in HC to a state in H\u22a5. A correctable error is a detectable error which can be \u201cundone\u201d without knowing or destroying the quantum superposition state. Formally, a set of errors {Ej} is correctable by a code C iff it obeys the KnillLaflamme condition [30]:\nPCE\u2020i EjPC = \u03b3ijPC \u2200i, j, (3)\nwhere \u03b3 is a Hermitian matrix. Here PC = \u2211K\u03b1=1 |\u03c8\u0304\u03b1\u3009\u3008\u03c8\u0304\u03b1| is the codespace projector from H to HC, and the set {|\u03c8\u0304\u03b1\u3009} forms an orthonormal basis for HC. Eq. (3) means that orthogonal code states remain orthogonal after the noise map, i.e., the encoded information is not corrupted. The condition for a detectable set of errors replaces Eq. (3) by PCEjPC = \u03b3jPC \u2200Ej [30].\nConsider a non-degenerate code [25]: a code for which different elements of the set of correctable errors map any code state to linearly independent states:\nEi |\u03c8\u0304\u03b1\u3009 6= Ej |\u03c8\u0304\u03b1\u3009 \u2200\u03b1, i 6= j. (4)\nNon-degeneracy is equivalent to \u03b3 in Eq. (3) having full rank.\nSince the number of linearly independent vectors in a Hilbert space is bounded by the dimension of the space itself, non-degenerate ((n, K, d)) binary quantum codes obey the quantum Hamming bound [17, 25]:\nt\n\u2211 j=0\n( n j ) 3j \u2264 2n\u2212k, (5)\nwhere t = b(d\u2212 1)/2c is the highest error weight for which the code can correct all errors. The QHB can be derived from a simple combinatorial counting argument: it states that the number of linearly independent (LI) states with no errors (2k) plus the number of LI states with correctable errors (2k \u2211tj=1 ( n j)3\nj) cannot exceed the total number of LI states in the Hilbert space (2n).\nOn the other hand, consider a degenerate code. For such a code, distinct correctable errors may have the same effect on the same state. This means that there exist some i, j such that:\nEi |\u03c8\u0304\u03b1\u3009 = Ej |\u03c8\u0304\u03b1\u3009 \u2200\u03b1. (6)\nDegeneracy is equivalent to \u03b3 in Eq. (3) being rank-deficient.\nSince in the degenerate case the vectors resulting from the action of different errors need not be linearly independent, the number of correctable errors may exceed the bound set by the dimension\nof the Hilbert space. This leaves open the possibility that a degenerate code may violate the quantum Hamming bound.1\nIt is important to note that code degeneracy and impurity are strictly quantum phenomena. Since any classical error is characterized by which bits it flips, all distinct classical errors map a given code state to distinct states. However, in quantum codes, the possibility of phase flips in conjunction with the Hilbert space structure of the code space, allows distinct errors to map to identical states. Interestingly, the first quantum error correcting code ever discovered was a degenerate code [6]."

Here q again refers to a q-level quantum system. As mentioned above, we assume we are dealing with qubits (q = 2) for simplicity, but the results can be generalized to q > 2.\nLet Pi(x; n) denote the i-th Krawtchouk polynomial, defined as follows:\nPi(x; n) \u2261 i\n\u2211 j=0\n(\u22121)j 3i\u2212j (\nx j )( n\u2212 x i\u2212 j ) , i = 0, 1, . . .\n(9)\nHere, the 3 comes from q2 \u2212 1, where we have used the above specification of q = 2. Krawtchouk polynomials are ubiquitous in both classical [34] and quantum coding theory [35]. The following theorem was proved in Ref. [27] (which follows from a result in Ref. [36]).\nTheorem 2 Given an ((n, K, d)) code, define S to be a non-empty subset of {0, ..., d \u2212 1} and define T \u2261 {0, ..., n}. If the function f (x; n) \u2261 \u2211ni=0 fi;n Pi(x; n) satisfies\n1. fg;n > 0 \u2200g \u2208 S, fg;n \u2265 0 otherwise.\n2. f (g; n) \u2264 0 \u2200g \u2208 T \\ S\nthen 2k \u2264 12n maxg\u2208S f (g;n) fg;n .\nSelect fg;n \u2261 ( \u2211ti=0 Pi(g; n) )2.

[27] showed that\nfg;n = (3t/t!)n2t + o(n2t) for g \u2208 S (11a) f (g; n) = 32n o(nt) for g \u2208 S (11b) f (g; n) = 0 for g \u2208 {d, . . . , n} (11c)\nand\nf (0; n) = 32n ( (3t/t!)nt + o(nt) ) . (12)\nThe asymptotic behavior implies that there exists an integer N(d) such that \u2200n > N(d):2\nmax g\u2208S f (g; n) fg;n = f (0; n) f0;n . (13)\nLi and Xing do not explicitly prove that the minimum n for which this condition holds is N(d), but they take this to be true in their numerical calculations of N(d). We conjecture this in our work as well, and checked the conjecture numerically as explained below. Succinctly:\nN(d) = (14) min { nd \u2208 Z \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 arg maxg\u2208S f (g; n)fg;n = 0 \u2200n > nd } .\nThen, Theorem 2 ensures that for such n\n2k \u2264 1 2n\n22n\n\u2211tj=0 3 j(nj)\n= 2n\n\u2211tj=0 3 j(nj)\n, (15)\n2 The same technique, with a different choice of ft;n, was used in [37] to derive the quantum Hamming and Singleton bounds.\nwhich is the QHB. In other words, by calculating N(d), we are guaranteed that as long as n > N(d), all QECCs with these n, d values satisfy the QHB. Also, in Ref. [27] it is shown that N(2m) = N(2m + 1) for all m \u2265 1. This allows us to limit our calculations to odd d only.\nEquation (14) provides us with a means to compute N(d) numerically, and the result is shown as the blue dots in Figure 1. More explicitly, we obtained the N(d) values shown in Figure 1 as follows: first, we generate a list of binomial coefficients with non-negative arguments using the recursive relationship(\nn k\n) = ( n\u2212 1 k\u2212 1 ) + ( n\u2212 1 k ) . (16)\nNext, for a given d, we loop over increasing values of n, starting with n = 1. For each n, we calculate f (g)fg \u2200g \u2208 S. If arg maxg\u2208S f (g) fg = 0, we set N(d) = n and end the loop for that d value, then move on to d + 2. Otherwise, we continue looping. Our method relies on the minimum n for which the condition (13) is satisfied to coincide with N(d). To gain confidence that such a hypothesis may have merit, we selected d = 21 and checked numerically that the condition (13) indeed holds \u2200n \u2208 {51, 499} (for n > 499 the numerical computations became unfeasible).\nThe efficiency of our numerical method allowed us to compute N(d) for up to d = 125, thereby\ndemonstrating non-existence of QHB-violating codes for d < 127. Data collection required one week on a high-performance computing cluster at the University of Southern California\u2019s Center for Advanced Research Computing (CARC). The scaling of time (T) required to numerically search for N(d) is polynomial in d with T = O(d5) (see Figure 2). There are no known analytic shortcuts for calculating N(d). Our Python code can be found in Ref. [38]."

            "text": "The Rains bound Eq. (8) restricts the space of allowed QECCs by providing a lower bound on n. Simultaneously, for sufficiently large n the Li-Xing bound ensures that the QHB is satisfied. Due to these observations, we numerically find N(d) for odd d up to 125 by searching for the lowest n for which Eq. (13) is satisfied, recovering and extending previous results by Li and Xing, who computed N(d) up to d = 15 [27]. Then, in combination with the Rains bound, we rule out the existence of QHB-violating codes with particular distances. Figure 1 illustrates this point. From the Rains bound, the only possible codes are ones that\nlie above the solid purple line. From the Li-Xing bound, we know that any code lying above the dot-dashed blue line must obey the QHB. Therefore, if the Rains bound lies above the Li-Xing bound for a given distance d, all existing distanced codes must obey the QHB. One may worry about the fact that the graphs cross at d = 1. However, recall that the distance d is the lowest weight of those errors which the code cannot detect, so a code with d = 1 cannot detect (let alone correct) any error.\nThere is a wide range of possible future work with the above bounds. First, and most directly, higher-powered computers can continually calculate the Li-Xing N(d) for larger d values; our empirical observation is that the time required scales as \u223c d5, so this calculation is relatively benign. If N(d) exceeds the Rains bound for a particular d value, it remains undetermined by this method whether or not there exists a QHB-violating code of distance d. In this case, one may employ known linear programming bounds to determine if a given ((n, K, d)) code exists [25, 26, 31].\nAnother approach would be to work with the LiXing bound analytically. To prove that the QHB holds for all QECCs, one must first rigorously prove the conjectured Eq. (14). It is then sufficient, but not necessary, to prove that the derivative of N(d) is less than 3 everywhere [recall Eq. (8)]. While this holds for our dataset, it is not clear that this should hold for all d. One could also attempt to directly analytically demonstrate that N(d) is less than the Rains bound for all d, regardless of its derivative. Both N(d) and its derivative are extremely complicated functions, and either of these results would be truly remarkable."
