    "abstractText": "In this paper we propose a strategy for discerning if new physics in the Wilson coefficient C9\u03bc is dominantly lepton flavor universality violating or if it contains a sizable lepton flavor universal component (C9 ). Distinguishing among these two cases, for which the model independent fit of the related scenarios exhibits similar pulls with respect to the Standard Model, is crucial to advance our understanding of the B anomalies. We first identify the origin of the degeneracy of these two cases and point out the key observables that can break it. In particular, while the observables measured so far that test lepton flavor universality exhibit similar dependencies to all the relevant Wilson coefficients, the forthcoming measurement of Q5 1\u20444 P0\u03bc 5 \u2212 P0e 5 is particularly sensitive to C9\u03bc \u2212 C9e. In fact, if Q5 were found to be small (i.e., close to its Standard Model value), this would imply a small C9\u03bc \u2212 C9e but a sizable C9 , given the preference of global fits for a large negative new physics contribution in C9\u03bc. We discuss the possible origins of C9 , in particular how it could originate from new physics. Here, a promising scenario that could even link b \u2192 sl\u00fel\u2212 to RD\u00f0 \u00de is the one in which C U 9 is generated from a tau loop via an off shell photon penguin diagram. This setup predicts the branching ratios of Bs \u2192 \u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212 and B \u2192 K\u00f0 \u00de\u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212 to lie within the reach of LHCb, CMS, and Belle II. Alternatively, in case of a nonobservation of these tauonic processes, we show that the most natural possibility to generate C9 is a Z 0 with partially lepton flavor universal couplings.",

We first identify the origin of the degeneracy of these two cases and point out the key observables that can break it. In particular, while the observables measured so far that test lepton flavor universality exhibit similar dependencies to all the relevant Wilson coefficients, the forthcoming measurement of Q5 \u00bc P0\u03bc5 \u2212 P0e5 is particularly sensitive to C9\u03bc \u2212 C9e. In fact, if Q5 were found to be small (i.e., close to its Standard Model value), this would imply a small C9\u03bc \u2212 C9e but a sizable CU9 , given the preference of global fits for a large negative new physics contribution in C9\u03bc. We discuss the possible origins of CU9 , in particular how it could originate from new physics. Here, a promising scenario that could even link b \u2192 sl\u00fel\u2212 to RD\u00f0 \u00de is the one in which C U 9 is generated from a tau loop via an off shell photon penguin diagram. This setup predicts the branching ratios of Bs \u2192 \u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212 and B \u2192 K\u00f0 \u00de\u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212 to lie within the reach of LHCb, CMS, and Belle II. Alternatively, in case of a nonobservation of these tauonic processes, we show that the most natural possibility to generate CU9 is a Z 0 with partially lepton flavor universal couplings.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.105.113007\nI. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION\nIn b \u2192 sl\u00fel\u2212 transitions, intriguing hints for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) have been uncovered. In particular, the accumulated evidence for new physics (NP) obtained by combining many different channels points convincingly towards a breakdown of the SM at the (multi)\nTeV scale. These global fits are, in principle, capable of identifying which specific NP patterns describe data best. However, it was found in Refs. [1,2] that several different NP patterns (or scenarios) are preferred over the SM hypothesis with a similar significance of more than 7\u03c3 (see also Refs. [3\u20136]). In fact, since the appearance of the first anomalies in the angular observables, most prominently P0\u03bc5 in B \u2192 K\n\u03bc\u00fe\u03bc\u2212 [7,8], and later on in the ratios RK\u00f0 \u00de [9\u201312], a main goal of the model-independent global fits was to identify which pattern of NP can account best for data. However, with each new update (see Ref. [13] for details and Ref. [14] for future progress) the pull with respect to the SM for the already preferred scenarios increased while no clear discrimination among them arose. In this context, the Wilson coefficient C9\u03bc of the operator \u00f0s\u0304\u03b3\u03bcPLb\u00de\u00f0\u03bc\u0304\u03b3\u03bc\u03bc\u00de plays the prominent role because its NP contribution is sizable in all scenarios that describe data *malguero@ifae.es \u2020matias@ifae.es \u2021bernat.capdevilasoler@unito.it \u00a7andreas.crivellin@cern.ch Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Nonetheless, it is not yet clear if the NP contribution entering C9\u03bc is dominantly related to muons; i.e., if it has a large lepton flavor universality violating (LFUV) component, or if it contains a sizable lepton flavor universal (LFU) term. In fact, all patterns that describe data well can be basically\nclassified in two groups depending on the size of the LFUV component of C9\u03bc (or inversely of the LFU one). Therefore, distinguishing among these twopossibilities (small or sizable LFUV component) is crucial to advance our understanding of which model could lie behind the B anomalies. However, while refining the measurements of the ratios RX (with X \u00bc K;K ; KS; K \u00fe;\u03d5) is of utmost importance to establish if LFU is violated in nature, it will not help in the near future in making progress towards disentangling between these two cases. In this paper wewill show that the inclusion of a different\nkind of LFUV observable (other than the RX ones) is decisive to break the degeneracy among the scenarios with large and small LFUV component in C9\u03bc to finally make progress in the identification of the pattern of NP realized in nature. Indeed, the use of a C9-dominated observable is a more promising strategy in the short term to answer this question, rather than collecting more and more statistics for RX-type observables. 1\nCurrently, the best candidate for a C9-dominated observable testing LFU that can discriminate among the leading scenarios is a measurement ofQ5 \u00bc P0\u03bc5 \u2212 P0e5 [15]. We will lay out a path based on this observable and b \u2192 s\u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212 processes that can be implemented in the near future to clarify the composition of C9\u03bc. In particular, the proposed strategy will help identifying the nature of the NP contributions entering C9\u03bc, i.e., how big the LFU component is, using the plausible direct link with b \u2192 s\u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212 processes such as BB\u2192K\u00f0 \u00de\u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212 and BBs\u2192\u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212 [16,17], motivated by the RD\u00f0 \u00de anomalies. As a byproduct we will also be able to quantify if some marginal, so far unknown, extra hadronic contribution affects C9\u03bc. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II we\ndiscuss the anatomy of the Wilson coefficient C9\u03bc. Section III describes how to determine the LFUV and LFU piece of this coefficient, while Sec. IV discusses the possible origins of the LFU component. Finally, Sec. V shows that Q5 classifies scenarios in two groups to conclude in Sec. VI."

On the one hand, it always appears in observables in combination with the Wilson coefficients of the four-quark operators O1;\u2026;6 (with Oi \u00bc 4Pi and Pi defined in Ref. [19]) and hence an \u201ceffective\u201d superscript is included to denote this combination (see Ref. [22]). On the other hand, the nonlocal contributions from cc\u0304 loops enter the same amplitude structures as O9 (and O7). Therefore, they can be naturally recast as a q2 (dilepton invariant mass), helicity and process dependent contribution accompanying the perturbative SM term CSM9\u03bcpert. We thus write (for the B \u2192 K l\u00fel\u2212 case)\nCeffB\u2192K 9\u03bcj \u00bc CSM9\u03bcpert \u00fe CNP9\u03bc \u00fe Ccc\u0304B\u2192K 9\u03bcj \u00f0q2\u00de; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere Ccc\u0304B\u2192K 9\u03bcj \u00bc sjCcc\u0304B\u2192K\n9 \u03bcjKMPW stands for the one soft-gluon nonfactorizable leading long-distance cc\u0304 contribution. This contribution is transversity amplitude dependent, therefore we introduce the subscript j for each amplitude j \u00bc \u22a5; jj; 0 [23] of the B \u2192 K l\u00fel\u2212 decay.2 Finally, a sj nuisance parameter is included and allowed to vary from \u22121 to 1 for each amplitude independently due to the theoretical difficulty to ascertain the relative phase between the long and short distance contributions and in order to be very conservative. For a discussion at length on our treatment of the charm-loop contributions we refer the reader to Refs. [25,26]. A first step in the analysis of CNP9\u03bc , in order to fix our notation for the next sections, is to split the NP piece of CNP9\u03bc into two:\n1Nonetheless, it is clear that both strategies (increasing statistics and targeting specific observables) should be implemented in the experimental program.\n2For the case of a B \u2192 K transition, the j subscript should be removed and the corresponding Ccc\u0304B\u2192K9\u03bcKMPW [24] should be used.\n113007-2\nCNP9\u03bc \u00bc CV9\u03bc \u00fe CU9 ; CNP9e \u00bc CU9 ; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere V (U) stands for the LFUV (LFU) contribution, respectively. Finally, if some hypothetical additional hadronic effect beyond the long-distance charm one already included3 exists, it would in general be process and q2\ndependent, like the long-distance charm contribution, and manifest itself in inconsistent values for CNP9\u03bc when comparing its determination from different channels.4 However, if it were, for unknown reasons, q2, process and helicity independent, such a hypothetical contribution could hide inside CU9 mimicking a universal NP contribution. In the following sections we will propose a strategy\nbased on identifying specific observables (i.e., Q5 and b \u2192 s\u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212 processes) able to disentangle the LFUV from the LFU piece in Eq. (7) and bound the possible size of extra \u201cuniversal\u201d hadronic contributions. In turn, the addition of those observables in the global fits will break present degeneracies among scenarios with large and small CV9\u03bc, providing a guideline to identify the NP pattern realized in nature."

            "text": "First of all, note that a nonzero CV9\u03bc must undoubtedly be of NP origin given that the SM gauge interactions do not discriminate between the lepton families. Since due to the measurements of RK and RK all scenarios that allow for a very good fit to data require of CV9\u03bc to some degree, it is clear that also P0\u03bc5 (or other b \u2192 s\u03bc \u00fe\u03bc\u2212 observables) must necessarily contain a NP contribution. But how can one determine the size of CV9\u03bc? For this purpose one should focus on observables that (1) can disentangle the LFUV piece from the LFU one and (2) are C9 dominated. Condition 1 is fulfilled by all observables measuring LFUV, however, not all LFUV observables are equally instrumental (or useful) in separating the two pieces (i.e., do not fulfill condition 2) because of the different relative weights of the Wilson coefficients entering the LFUV observables.\nIn order to illustrate this, we have computed the expressions for RK, RK as semianalytic functions of the Wilson coefficients in the [1.1,6] GeV2 bin\nRK \u00bc \u00bd1\u2212 0.26\u00f0CNP10\u03bc \u00fe C100\u03bc\u00de\u00fe 0.23\u00f0CNP9\u03bc \u00fe C90\u03bc\u00de\u00fe SK\u03bc = \u00bd1\u2212 0.26\u00f0CNP10e \u00fe C100e\u00de\u00fe 0.23\u00f0CNP9e \u00fe C90e\u00de\u00fe SKe ; RK \u00bc \u00bd1\u2212 0.29CNP10\u03bc \u00fe 0.20C100\u03bc \u00fe 0.16\u00f0CNP9\u03bc \u2212 C90\u03bc\u00de\u00fe SK\n\u03bc = \u00bd1\u2212 0.29CNP10e \u00fe 0.20C100e \u00fe 0.16\u00f0CNP9e \u2212 C90e\u00de\u00fe SK\ne ; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere SKl \u00bc0.03\u00bd\u00f0CNP9l \u00feC90l\u00de2\u00fe\u00f0CNP10l\u00feC100l\u00de2 and SK l \u00bc 0.03\u00bd\u00f0CNP9l \u2212 C90l\u00de2 \u00fe \u00f0CNP10l \u2212 C100l\u00de2 \u00fe 0.02\u00bdCNP9l C90l \u00fe CNP10lC100l are subleading quadratic terms.5 Expanding the observables in Eq. (8) in the limit of small values for the NP Wilson coefficients naturally give rise to an expression in terms of CVi\u03bc \u00bc Ci\u03bc \u2212 Cie [analogous to Eq. (7)] and subleading crossed terms CVi\u03bcC U j . These expressions show that while these observables are fundamental to establish the presence of LFUV NP, they are not particularly useful to pin down one among the different currently preferred scenarios. This is clear from the expression of RK , where CNP9\u03bc and C NP 10\u03bc have approximately the same weight, such that, e.g., CNP9\u03bc \u00bc \u22121 results in nearly the same prediction as CNP9\u03bc \u00bc \u2212CNP10\u03bc \u00bc \u22120.5. Furthermore, even though in the case of RK the sensitivity to CNP9\u03bc and C NP 10\u03bc differs by near a factor of 2, this is not enough to determine CV9\u03bc precisely due to the hadronic uncertainties affecting RK\u00f0 \u00de in the presence of NP. These considerations clearly imply that we cannot discern from the RK\u00f0 \u00de observables C V 9\u03bc due to the similar dependence on CV10\u03bc (and also on primed Wilson coefficients) that they exhibit; i.e., the RK\u00f0 \u00de ratios do not fulfill condition 2. Instead, a LFUV observable that fulfills condition 2 isQ5 (evaluated on the same bin [1.1,6] GeV2):\nQ5 \u00bc QSM5 \u2212 0.25CV9\u03bc \u00fe 0.20CV100\u03bc \u00fe SQ5; \u00f09\u00de\nwith QSM5 \u00bc \u22120.01 and where, contrary to RX observables, the subleading contribution includes also linear terms,\nSQ5 \u00bc \u22120.02CV10\u03bc \u2212 0.04CV90\u03bc \u00fe 0.03CV9\u03bc2 \u00fe 0.07CV9\u03bcCU9 \u00fe 0.05\u00bdCV10\u03bcCV100\u03bc \u00fe CV10\u03bcCU100 \u00fe CV100\u03bcCU10 \u2212 0.03\u00bdCV9\u03bcCV90\u03bc \u00fe CV9\u03bcCU90 \u00fe CV90\u03bcCU9 \u00fe CV100\u03bcCU100 \u2212 0.04\u00bdCV\n90\u03bcC V 100\u03bc \u00fe CV100\u03bcCU90 \u00fe CV90\u03bcCU100 ; \u00f010\u00de 3In recent years there has been an important progress on the theoretical side to evaluate more precisely the impact of longdistance charm contribution entering Ceff9 either using explicit computations or resonance data to model it [27]. Particularly important is the result presented in Ref. [28] where it was found that the next-to-leading order (NLO) contribution is almost negligible as compared to the leading order (LO) soft-gluon exchange computed in Ref. [23].\n4For instance, the long-distance charm contribution entering B \u2192 Kl\u00fel\u2212 was found to be negligible in Ref. [24] compared to the one of B \u2192 K l\u00fel\u2212 [23]. Furthermore, with the present precision, the different channels within the global fits points to a consistent picture, disfavoring such a hypothesis.\n5Note that all the semianalytic expressions presented in this paper should be taken as a guideline to understand the sensitivity to NP that an observable exhibits, neglecting uncertainties. However, these uncertainties should always be included when determining the Wilson coefficients (see Fig. 1).\n113007-3\nwhere the last three terms correspond to small cross products of LFUV and LFU contributions. Equation (9) shows that Q5, contrary to RK\u00f0 \u00de , breaks the approximate degeneracy of the two scenarios (CNP9\u03bc versus C NP 9\u03bc \u00bc \u2212CNP10\u03bc) as the dominant contributions in Q5 originate from CV9\u03bc and CV 100\u03bc (or combined as C\u0303 V 9\u03bc \u00bc CV9\u03bc \u2212 0.8CV100\u03bc) with CV10\u03bc playing a negligible role as can be seen from SQ5 . Moreover, the structure of Q5 and the preference of the global fits [1] for a large negative CV9\u03bc with a small (also) negative CV\n100\u03bc, implies that a measurement of Q5, even in presence of right-handed currents (RHCs), provides a lower bound on the absolute value of jCV9\u03bcj. For instance, the best fit point of the 1D scenario with only CNP9\u03bc is C NP 9\u03bc \u00bc \u22121.01, while in the 2D scenario with CNP9\u03bc and C100\u03bc it was found that [1] fCNP9\u03bc \u00bc \u22121.15; C100\u03bc \u00bc \u22120.26g. Therefore,\njCV9\u03bcj \u00bc jC\u0303V9\u03bc \u00fe 0.8CV100\u03bcj \u2265 jC\u0303V9\u03bcj; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere C\u0303V9\u03bc is obtained using\nQ5 \u2243QSM5 \u2212 0.25C\u0303 V 9\u03bc: \u00f012\u00de\nThe left plot in Fig. 1 showsQ5 versus CV9\u03bc, i.e., the value of CV9\u03bc that can be inferred from a measurement of Q5 in absence of any other source of NP. In summary, even in presence of RHCs contributing to CV 100\u03bc, Q5 provides a lower bound (or a measurement in absence of them) on CV9\u03bc. Note that in the future a precise measurement of the observablesPl1 (with l \u00bc e, \u03bc) [29\u201331] can help to identify the presence of RHCs. This observable is approximately zero in the large-recoil region in absence of RHCs. Therefore a deviation observed in Pl1 will indicate nonzero primed Wilson coefficients.\nB. Determining CU9 The next step is to identify the LFU piece CU9 using P 0\u03bc 5 and in the future also P0e5 . For this we calculate P 0\u03bc 5 in the [1.1,6] GeV2 bin, which follows from Q5 with obvious substitutions:\nP0\u03bc5 \u00bc P0\u03bcSM5 \u2212 0.25CNP9\u03bc \u00fe 0.20C100\u03bc \u00fe SP 0\u03bc 5 ; \u00f013\u00de\nwhere P0\u03bcSM5 \u00bc \u22120.44 and\nSP 0\u03bc 5 \u00bc \u22120.02CNP10\u03bc \u2212 0.04C90\u03bc \u00fe 0.03CNP29\u03bc \u2212 0.03CNP9\u03bc C90\u03bc\n\u00fe 0.05CNP10\u03bcC100\u03bc \u2212 0.04CNP90\u03bcC100\u03bc: \u00f014\u00de\nOur central point here is to show that one can determine a lower bound on CU9 as well using a similar strategy as for Q5. Equation (13) can be approximated to\nP0\u03bc5 \u2243 P 0\u03bcSM 5 \u2212 0.25C\u03039\u03bc; \u00f015\u00de\nwhere C\u03039\u03bc \u00bc CNP9\u03bc \u2212 0.8C100\u03bc. Then if we have data available only from Q5 and P 0\u03bc 5 we obtain immediately an upper bound on the universal piece from6\njCU9 j \u00bc jC\u03039\u03bc \u2212 C\u0303V9\u03bc \u00fe 0.8CU100 j \u2265 jC\u03039\u03bc \u2212 C\u0303V9\u03bcj; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere the terms on the rhs correspond to the measurement of the NP piece entering P0\u03bc5 and Q5 using Eqs. (12) and (15), respectively. Notice that in the absence of universal RHC contributions the bound turns into a measurement.\n6In the same way, we can obtain, using the definitions of C\u03039\u03bc and C\u0303V9\u03bc, not just a bound, but the total amount of LFU from C\u03039\u03bc \u2212 C\u0303V9\u03bc \u00bc CU9 \u2212 0.8CU100 .\n113007-4\nInstead, if experiments also provided data on the electronic angular observable P0e5 , then we could directly get\njCU9 j \u00bc jC\u03039e \u00fe 0.8CU100 j \u2265 jC\u03039ej; \u00f017\u00de\nwhere theWilson coefficients for electrons are obtained from Eq. (15) by replacing \u03bc with e, where a preference from global fits for a negative sign in both coefficients (CU9 and CU 100 ) is also required (see scenarios 7 and 11 in Ref. [1]). Note that in contrast to CV9\u03bc, which can only originate from NP, the LFU piece, as pointed out earlier could in principle contain, together with the NP contribution, some residual higher-order hadronic effect. For this reason we have to proceed differently for the LFU piece, identifying and measuring separately all possible sources of LFU NP. The difference between CU9 obtained following Eqs. (16) and (17), and the one obtained from the different NP sources (called from now on CNPU9 ), provides the best strategy to identify the actual amount (if any) of an unknown hadronic contribution.\nIV. POSSIBLE ORIGINS OF CU9\nAssumingQ5 is found to be small, this would imply also a small CV9\u03bc but a sizeable C U 9 , given the present preference of global fits for a large negative CNP9\u03bc . Then the question of a possible origin of the LFU contribution arises since most models considered in the literature generate purely LFUV effects (see Refs. [32\u201335] for some exceptions). There are three (nonexclusive) possibilities how one could obtain an effect in CU9 . First of all, it could originate, as discussed above, from some unknown and intricate hadronic effect. Second, it could be generated via a direct LFU NP contribution, and finally it could be induced indirectly from a NP effect via renormalization group effects originating from loops involving light SM particles."

Therefore, a single new particle (with the exception of a Z0) does not generate solely a contribution to C9. Furthermore, in models containing leptoquarks (LQs), or new scalars and fermions contributing at the loop level, in order to get a LFU effect, several generations of such new particles are necessary to avoid the stringent bounds from charged lepton flavor violating processes generated otherwise such as \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 [36\u201338]. Therefore, a Z0 boson with vectorial leptons couplings seems to be the most natural possibility to generate CNPU9 , in particular since such couplings allow for simple gauge anomaly free charge assignments. For example, 3L\u03bc \u00fe Le \u2212 4L\u03c4 gives a (partially) LFU effect, it can describe data very well and the\nnecessary couplings to b \u2212 s can be induced by vectorlike quarks [39,40]."

However, if f \u00bc u, d, then LHC bounds on dijet searches [42,43] rule out such a possibility. Furthermore, for f \u00bc s, c a sizable effect is disfavored by these constraints, while for f \u00bc e, \u03bc one generates direct LFUV effects dominant over the mixing induced one. Therefore, we are left with f \u00bc b, \u03c4. Given that any tree-level NP model generating s\u0304\u03b3\u03bcPLbb\u0304\u03b3\u03bcb also gives rise to Bs \u2212 B\u0304s mixing, the possible size of this contribution is significantly limited. Therefore, the most unconstrained scenario capable of providing the largest effect in CNPU9 are tau leptons.

In fact, because leptoquarks are the only particles that can generate a large C\u03c4\u03c49 without being in conflict with other processes (like Bs \u2212 B\u0304s mixing and/or LHC searches), we have either C\u03c4\u03c49 \u00bc C\u03c4\u03c410 in case of the S2 LQ [38] or C\u03c4\u03c49 \u00bc \u2212C\u03c4\u03c410 for U1 [17] of S1 \u00fe S3 [44] unless several representations are combined.7 Therefore, Eq.

This contribution is given by the difference between CU9 and C NPU 9 .\nIn order to get now a rough idea of the size of such hypothetical hadronic quantity that we will refer as \u0394 and given the current absence of a precise measurement of Q5 from LHCb, we can proceed in the following way. Let us assume that scenario 8 or scenario-U (see Table I for definition), which predicts a sizable CU9 and currently gives the best fit to data of all scenarios is the right scenario implemented in nature. Assuming in addition the link with RD\u00f0 \u00de , the difference between C U 9 obtained from the global fit (see Table I), without using the connection with RD\u00f0 \u00de , and CNPU9 obtained using Eq. (21) for \u039b \u00bc 2 TeV gives us an idea of an upper bound on an unknown hadronic contribution. With present data, in scenario-U this amounts roughly to a value for \u0394 \u223c \u22120.28, which is a rather small effect (\u22486.8%) compared to the SM value of C9\u03bc, especially considering that the NP contribution to this coefficient is of order 20% of its SM value. But more interesting is the fact that this quantity depends on the NP scale (\u039b).10 This implies that a larger NP scale (\u039b) leads also to a larger CNPU9\n8In case of partial alignment, i.e., a nongeneric flavor structure [45], the right-hand side of Eq. (20) should be multiplied by a factor 1=\u00f01\u00fe VcbC\u00f01;3\u00de3333=C\u00f01;3\u00de2333\u00de.\n9Note that C\u03c4\u03c49 also has a small q 2 dependent contribution to B \u2192 K\u00f0 \u00del\u00fel\u2212 matrix elements [46]. 10In order to keep couplings in a perturbative regime, the scale of NP cannot go beyond 10 TeV.\n113007-6\n(given a fixed RD\u00f0 \u00de) and in turn \u0394 becomes even smaller (in absolute value) up to \u0394 \u223c \u22120.13 for \u039b \u00bc 10 TeV.\nV. WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM Q5?\nAswehavediscussedintheprevioussection,Q5 isaunique discriminator of the presence of a LFUVpiece in CNP9\u03bc . So far, onlyBellehasprovidedameasurementof thisobservable[48] (usinganaverageofneutralandchargeddecaystoincreasethe statistics), albeit with very large error bars,\nQ\u00bd1.1;6 5 \u00bc 0.656 0.485 0.103: \u00f022\u00de The ten most strongly preferred NP scenarios, i.e., with\nPullSM above 6.5\u03c3, (see Fig. 4) can be classified in twogroups: (1) Scenarios with CV9\u03bc \u2272 \u22121: CNP9\u03bc , fCNP9\u03bc ; C90\u03bcg,\nfCNP9\u03bc ; C100\u03bcg, hypotheses I and V (or scenario-R), scenarios 10, 11, 13 (see Table I for definitions). They all predict Q5 \u2248\u00fe0.3. The largest PullSM was found in Ref. [1] for scenario-R (see Table I). In this scenario the contribution of CNP9\u03bc is counterbalanced by the contribution of the primed coefficients (RHCs) in observables like RK . (2) Scenarios where the contribution to CNP9\u03bc contains both a LFUV and a LFU piece with the absolute value of the former being smaller compared to the previous case: scenario-U and scenario 6. The reason\nwhy the absolute value of the LFUV piece is smaller than in the previous case is the link to CNP10\u03bc, resulting in a bound from BBs\u2192\u03bc\u00fe\u03bc\u2212 . The largest PullSM is found for scenario-U (also called scenario 8) predicting Q5 \u2248\u00fe0.1. This clearly indicates that while RK is fundamental to establish the violation of LFU, finding Q5 close to its SM valuewould by nomeans be contradictory to the violation of LFU inRK . In other words, it is essential to consider the pair RK and Q5 (but also other RX observables). Therefore, a measurement of Q5 close to \u00fe0.3 would point to one of the scenarios of the first group (including those with RHCs), while a Q5 \u223c\u00fe0.1 (very close to SM) would indicate the presence of LFU NP. No other observable has this power to discriminate among these two kinds of scenarios. We observed no difference (in terms of PullSM) between scenario-R and scenario-U along the years (in 2019, 2020, 2021), with 7.1\u03c3 (scenario-R) and 7.2\u03c3 (scenario-U) in the latest analysis. Here, we have studied the impact of a measurement of Q\u00bd1.1;6 5 using all data entering the global fits in Table II, assuming two experimental values for this observable: 0.30 0.10 and 0.10 0.10. If the measurement falls within the former range then no disentangling is possible, while for the latter some marginal disentangling arises. On the other hand, if the precision on Q\u00bd1.1;6 5 improves by a factor of 2 (see Table III), some difference of around 0.7\u03c3 appears between the two options. The corresponding results using only LFUV observables are also displayed in Tables II and III."

BBs\u2192\u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212 , if found to be very large, is a clear NP signal, and if linked to RD\u00f0 \u00de=R SM D\u00f0 \u00de , determines the amount of LFU NP in CNP9\u03bc . In turn a large LFU NP implies the smallness of any unknown hadronic contribution (beyond those already included in our\nconservative setup outlined in Sec. II). The resulting proposed procedure for determining the origin of NP is shown graphically in Fig. 5."
