            "text": "There has been extensive interest in the recognition and sensing of metal ions owing to their essential roles in biological and environmental systems. Because of its excellent characteristics of simple equipment, user friendliness, high analysis speed and high sensitivity, uorescence detection has made substantial progress in sensing metal ions. Simple and effective types of sensing practices have been designed based on the response of uorescence materials to metal ions. The rst essential requirement for the sensor to function as a useful uorescence sensor is to recognise the target metal ions over competing species and register the recognition event in a quantiable manner. Different types of uorescent sensing approaches have been developed for detecting metal ions. In particular, the ratio metric uorescence sensor has been widely acclaimed for achieving accurate detection. Specically, this sensor quanties the target by the uorescence intensity ratio of the different emission wavelengths; one of the uorescence signals is selectively suppressed or enhanced and the other reference signal is not affected by the target metal ions.1 Hence, it can be self-calibrated through dual-channel detection to eliminate environmental and instrumental inferences.2,3 Generally, a ratio\nUniversity, Xining, 810016, P. R. China.\nAgriculture, Qinghai University, Xining,\ntion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nmetric uorescence sensor comprises uorescent substances and the host. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are an emerging class of porous materials formed by self-assembling metal ions and organic ligands through coordination interactions.4 ZIFs have attracted considerable interest as an ideal host material to encapsulate functional nano uorescent substances, such as carbon dots (CDs),5 oligonucleotides,6 proteins7 and DNAzyme,8 owing to the particular nanometre-conned space of porous materials.\nMost ratio uorescence sensors consider ZIFs as the hosts, which are always loaded with two different uorescent substances. Because of the weak uorescence of ZIFs, it is very rare to simultaneously consider ZIFs as the uorescence substance and the host. However, based on our previous ndings, compared with ZIF-8, the leaf-like ZIF (ZIF-L) has a larger loading capacity and exhibits greater improvement in uorescence performance, indicating that the ZIF-L can probably be used both as a host and a desirable ratio uorescent substance, which only needs an extra uorescent substance. Another problemwith using ZIF-L as a host is its poor dispersion. Because of the larger particle size, gravity results in easy precipitation of ZIF-L from the solution, making the detection result imperfect. Although the surface-exposed metal sites of ZIF make it possess some level of hydrophilic property, the ZIF-L tends to distribute only in high polarity solvents, limiting its potential applications to less polar environments. Thus, surface chemistry that can enhance particle\u2013solvent interactions is critical.9\nIn the existing studies, there are usually two ways to solve the dispersibility problem of ZIFmaterials. One is to use a shell ligand exchange reaction to change the surface of layered ZIF from\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 31353\u201331364 | 31353\nFig. 1 Schematic illustration of the synthetic process of CDs@ZIF-L/PEI and the ratiometric detection of Hg2+.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

When PEG and PEI are modied on the ZIF-8 surface, the dispersion of ZIF-8 can be effectively improved.13\u201315\nCDs are popular in uorescence sensing due to their excellent water solubility, uorescence stability, low cytotoxicity and environmental friendliness. ZIF materials have been attested as an ideal host material to encapsulate functional nano CDs.16\u201318 Especially ZIF-8 is popular for encapsulating nanoparticles because of its simple synthesis conditions and adjustable pore.5\u20138 It has been reported in the literature, rhodamine B, CdZnS quantum dots and GaN had been encapsulated into ZIF-8 to improve the detection selectivity and sensitivity.19\u201321However, they are all based on singlepeak detection and are easily affected by external factors. Solidstate aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) is a troublesome problem in developing potential applications for CDs.\nIn this work, CDs, Zn(NO3)2$6H2O and H-mim were mixed and stirred to prepare CD@ZIF-L using an effective and simple one-pot synthesis method, as shown in Fig. 1. Further, PEI was modied on the CDs@ZIF-L surface. The CDs@ZIF-L/PEI sensor showed dual-emission peaks at 370 and 440 nm, which could detect Hg2+ as a ratiometric uorescent sensor. Adding the hydrophilic polymer PEI enhanced the dispersion performance of the ZIF material in water. This approach solved the instability problem of ZIF materials and made the sensor perform better at detecting Hg2+ in water."

Moreover, the elemental mapping images shown in Fig. 2d\u2013g and the energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results shown in Fig. 2h demonstrated that the CDs@ZIF-L/PEI comprised four elements: C, N, O and Zn, indicating that the corresponding elements were uniformly distributed in the composites. The above results indicate that CDs is successfully doped into the ZIF-L using the encapsulation strategy.\nFig. 3a is the characterization of the XRD pattern of H-mim, ZIF-L, CDs@ZIF-L and CDs@ZIF-L/PEI respectively. All peaks in the XRD pattern of powder samples were sharp and consistent with the simulative patterns (CCDC: 1509273) and ZIF-L patterns in previous literature,23 conrming that the ZIF-L host was effectively synthesized. And the dimethylimidazole diffraction peaks further proved that ZIF-L was synthesized successfully. By comparison with the simulative patterns for ZIF-L, it was found that the as-synthesized samples had a relatively weak peak at 2q = 7.34\u00b0 of the (011) plane and no signicant changes and typical diffraction peaks of PEI species in the XRD pattern of CDs@ZIF-L and CDs@ZIF-L/PEI were observed due to the low amount of PEI in the hybrid, indicating that doping of CDs does not affect the crystal structure of ZIF-L. Aer doping by CDs, compared with pure ZIF-L, we found an apparent increase of the peak at 2q = 7.76\u00b0 illustrates the preferential growth through this lattice plane, which should be result in the change of the particles shape. Thus, speculate addition of CDs could affect the diffraction peaks and the structure of ZIF-L.\nThe FT-IR spectra of ZIF-L, CDs@ZIF-L and CDs@ZIF-L/PEI are shown in Fig. 3b, indicating that the characteristic adsorption peaks of the synthesised CDs@ZIF-L and CDs@ZIF-L/PEI\nFig. 3 (a) XRD and (b) FT-IR of ZIF-L, CDs@ZIF-L and CDs@ZIF-L/PEI an\n31356 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 31353\u201331364\nwere similar to those of the ZIF-L. The absorption peaks at 3420 cm\u22121 are attributed to O\u2013H bonds;23 the peaks at 2930 cm\u22121 represents C\u2013H bonds in the methyl and imidazole rings24 and the peaks at 692 and 754 cm\u22121 represent Zn\u2013N and Zn\u2013O,25 respectively. Moreover, the absorption peaks at 1148 cm\u22121 are attributed to the stretching vibration peaks of C\u2013N bonds in imidazole rings, while those at 1566 cm\u22121 are attributed to C]N.25 In CDs@ZIF-L, framed in purple, the peaks at 1393 and 1580 cm\u22121 occur due to C\u2013N and C]O/C]C from CDs,26 indicating that CDs are introduced into the ZIF-L cavity. In CDs@ZIF-L/PEI, the peaks of C\u2013N and C]N were stronger owing to the presence of amino groups on the PEI surface. The \u2013NH bond at 1600 cm\u22121, close to the absorption peak of C]N. Aer PEI doping, the characteristic absorption peak at 692 cm\u22121 became more obvious, might due to the N\u2013H of PEI could coordinate with Zn2+ to form \u2013N\u2013Zn. The characteristic absorption peaks of CDs@ZIF-L/PEI, framed in green, were sharper and stronger. In previous studies,27 those absorption peaks approaching 1458 and 1585 cm\u22121 were also associated with the N\u2013H vibration of primary and secondary amino groups, respectively. Meanwhile, these groups could interact with the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups of CDs. The formation of hydrogen bonds could facilitate interfacial compatibility, which indicates excellent stability in water of CDs@ZIF-L/PEI. These analyses conrmed that PEI was successfully linked on the CDs@ZIF-L surface.\nThe surface composition and elemental states of powder materials were identied using XPS analysis.

The PEI was successfully linked on the CDs@ZIF-L. Identically, zeta-potential testing can verify the CDs doping process of the ZIF-L channel and the modication role of PEI in the ZIF-L surface. As shown in Fig. 5e, the surface of the ZIF-L was positively charged; according to the literature,32 the average zeta potentials of CDs are usually negative. Thus, the zeta potential of CDs@ZIF-L changed to \u221255 mV, implying that the electrostatic interaction led to the formation of CDs@ZIF-L.32 Aer PEI was linked on its surface, the potential was positively charged again. This can be attributed to the extensive protonation of amine in PEI molecules.\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements for the ZIF-L, CDs@ZIF-L and CDs@ZIF-L/PEI were performed in the temperature range from 25 \u00b0C to 800 \u00b0C in the N2 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 5f, there was a slight loss at 150 \u2013250 \u00b0C, indicating the removal of residual H2O molecules and the high water content (PEI, MW = 10 000, 50% H2O) of three powder samples. For ZIF-L and CDs@ZIF-L, the second stage began at 250 \u2013370 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the removal of residual solvent and the decomposition of the amide groups in CDs. In the case of CDs@ZIF-L and CDs@ZIF-L/PEI, the next weight loss stage was observed up to 560 \u00b0C, ascribed to the thermal decomposition of PEI polymer chains.34 The mass loss phase end at 600 \u00b0C can be attributed to the collapse of the framework. The specic surface area and aperture of samples can also affirm whether CDs and PEI are successfully encapsulated in the channel of ZIF-L. In addition, a heat stability test was performed as shown in the appended gure of Fig. 5f. Aer the treatment of CDs@ZIF-L/PEI at 200 \u00b0C, 400 \u00b0C and 600 \u00b0C, the XRD test was performed. According to the XRD results, CDs@ZIF-L/PEI treated at 200 \u00b0C exhibited characteristic peaks of ZIF-L. However, at 400 \u00b0C, the characteristic peaks of ZIF-L decreased observably. At 600 \u00b0C, ZIF-L characteristic peaks disappear completely. Thus it could be concluded that ZIF-L could exhibited good heat stability under 200 \u00b0C."

Notably, the ZIF-L and CDs could emit corresponding peaks when EX = 330 nm owing to the excitation wavelength dependence. Hence, the dual-emitter material could be obtained by the reorganisation of the ZIF-L and CDs. Moreover, to nd the optimal excitation wavelength of the composite, the emission spectra were explored at 310, 330 and 350 nm excitation wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 6b, indicating that two relatively complete peaks of the ZIF-L (EM = 370 nm) and CDs (EM = 440 nm) appeared simultaneously at EX = 330 nm. Therefore, 330 nm was selected as the optimal excitation wavelength of the composite for subsequent experiments."

Additionally, no evident uorescent responses could be found in the presence of the other ions except for Fe3+. To validate the detection accuracy of CDs@ZIF-L/PEI for Hg2+, the anti-interference ability was further investigated by mixing Hg2+ with various metal ion solutions. As depicted in Fig. 6e and f, whatever metal ion was mixed up with the Hg2+ solution, the IZIF-L/ICDs of CDs@ZIF-L/PEI remained equable and nearly constant, except for Fe3+. The reason for the negative change of IZIF-L/ICDs on Fe\n3+ is that the CDs and ZIF-L exhibit quenching properties on Fe3+. In addition, the H2O2 solution could reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+.

The composite exhibited great uorescence properties and water stability. By doping CDs in the ZIF-L, the composite exhibited dual emissions at 370 and 440 nm for a more sensitive detection of Hg2+. Moreover, compared to CDs@ZIF-L, CDs@ZIF-L/PEI process better solubility and stability. The composite, CDs@ZIF-L/PEI, produced high sensitivity (LOD = 14.5 nM), high stability (no precipitate within 60 min) and great selectivity. The dual wavelength ratiometry-based approach was successfully used for detecting Hg2+ in tap water, Beichuan Lake, and foundation with satisfactory recoveries of 92\u2013102%, 92.9\u2013100.4% and 96.2\u2013103.2%, respectively, indicating CDs@ZIF-L/PEI was applicable and exhibited considerable potential for application in the different environment.
