            "text": "The free electrons in the conduction band of a metal collectively oscillate when excited with an external electromagnetic field. By nanostructuring these metals, we can induce strong resonant oscillations that couple strongly with radiation.[1\u20133] These modes, known as localized surface plasmon resonances, appear in the optical frequency range for noble metal nanostructures of sub-wavelength dimensions. Importantly, such metal nano-objects, due to their plasmon resonances, enable a spatial and temporal manipulation of light at the nanoscale.[4\u201312] Metal nanomaterials and nanocrystals (NCs) can confine and concentrate electromagnetic fields near their surface through the excitation of LSPRs. There are two main optical processes associated with a metal NC: scattering of photons, which can be observed in the far-field zone, and light absorption, which localizes the electromagnetic inside a NC. The optical excitation generates a\nnon-equilibrium distribution of electrons in the metal NC, which involves both low-energy intraband carriers (Drude currents) and hot carriers with high energies.[9,13\u201316] For the latter, there are two excitation pathways: (1) the generation of hot electrons (HEs) inside the sp-band via surface scattering and (2) the creation of energetic holes in the d-band through interband transitions.[9,17\u201322]Numerous theoretical and experimental studies have contributed to a better understanding of the generation of hot carriers in plasmonic nanostructures and their injection to other media.[7,8,12,14,22\u201326] Regarding the process of photo-excitation in a NC, the distribution of hot-carriers excited above and below the Fermi energy of the metal depends on the incoming photon energy, the metal band structure, and the relaxation pathways available to the system.[9,13,15,27] First, the non-thermalized carriers (electrons and holes), which we label here as \u201chot\u201d, experience ultrafast (on the fs-scale) non-radiative relaxation in a metal NC through electron-electron scattering.[7,23] Afterwards, the distribution of excited carriers reaches a steady state balancing the continuous optical excitation and electron-phonon collisions (on the picosecond scale). This process results in the energy transfer to the atomic lattice and leads into an increase of the lattice temperature of the metal. It can also be regarded as photoheating.\nA particularly active research direction within the field of HE physics is its application in the context of plasmonic photochemistry. Within this area of study, we can find a variety of heterogeneous photochemical regimes and effects (Figure 1). Photochemical transformations can occur in the bulk of a liquid matrix[28] (Figure 1a); in this case, HEs are first generated inside a NC and then transferred to the liquid, creating reactive chemical species. Excited plasmonic carriers and their energy can also be applied in the nanofabrication of hybrid nanostructures.[29] For instance, HEs and hot-holes (HHs) were used for site-selective reactions leading to photo-growth of NCs with complex shapes (Figure 1b,c,j).[19,30,31] The use of chiral nano-assemblies may enable polarization-sensitive photochemical reactivity promoted by HEs (Figure 1k).[32] Unlike the surface-assisted HE process, the excitation of energetic d-holes is a bulk process and was also utilized for various photoreactions (Figure 1d,e),[17,18] including the\nchallenging synthesis of hydrocarbons from CO2 (Figure 1f). [33,34] Within a hybrid Au-TiO2 system, the injection of non-thermal hot carriers excited through different mechanisms can coexist (Figure 1g),[35] so that both intraband HEs and hot d-holes in the Au component, together with the interband electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor, can contribute to a photoreaction.[35] One can map HEs and related hot spots by observing the photochemical growth of plasmonic nano-islands (Figure 1h, top graph).[36] Contrasting with hot-carrier photochemistry, a pure photo-thermal mechanism can be used to grow a semiconductor layer on gold NCs using low energy ( 1.1 eV ) irradiation in the IR spectral range (Figure 1h, bottom graph).[37] In plasmonic photochemistry, hot-electron effects may co-exist with photoheating, and such behavior was demonstrated in ref. [38]. In the above experimental examples, surface photochemistry rates can be either isotropic (Figure 1d-g) or strongly anisotropic (Figure 1a-c, h-k); therefore, it should be critical to fully understand and characterize the related spatial distributions of HEs generation and temperature. In the case of the intraband HEs (Figure 1a,g), the generation process occurs at the surface of a NC,[9,14] and the relevant physical quantity to compute should be the surface map of the rate of HE generation.[14] For the hot d-holes (Figure 1d-f), the photogeneration occurs in the bulk of a NC, and we consequently need to look at bulk excitation distributions, which will be computed in the next sections; such bulk distributions will in general be non-uniform inside a NC and may lead to the anisotropy of photochemical reaction rates at the surface. The photothermal chemical processes depend on the phototemperature near the NC, so that, again, a surface temperature map should be a relevant quantity to study. The above considerations define our main motivation for this paper \u2013 we aim to computationally investigate the spatial distributions of the generation rates for the HEs, dholes, and phototemperature in NCs with complex shapes, critically discussing their different properties.\nIn this paper, we investigate HE and photothermal effects in plasmonic NCs with\ncomplex shapes in both substrate and solution settings. These photophysical effects are\nresponsible for plasmon-driven surface photochemistry and play major roles in many recent experimental realizations of plasmonic photocatalysis. Importantly, we develop and use convenient computational formalisms to reveal such spatial distributions. In particular, this paper describes the shape and polarization dependences of the spatial distributions of the physical quantities mentioned above, comprehensively discussing their different properties. We evaluate these distributions for gold NCs with complex shapes, develop convenient computational formalisms for their study, and compute their efficiencies. The generation processes of our interest involve excited low-energy Drude electrons, high-energy intraband electrons, and high-energy d-holes. The generation rates of energetic carriers involve both surface and bulk mechanisms. As a parallel task, we examine the spatial distributions of the phototemperature in NCs with complex shapes\nOur results reveal that the spatial distribution of the generation rates of high-energy\ncarriers (intraband HEs and d-holes) is typically shape- and polarization-dependent. In particular, these physical magnitudes reflect the presence of hot spots in a NC,[15,39,40] can be strongly anisotropic, and depend on the experimental setting. We observe that, whereas the HEs rates are distributed non-uniformly inside NCs, the phototemperature is uniform within a NC. Such uniform phototemperature distributions originate from the high thermal conductivity of noble metals. Furthermore, our theory covers two experimentally relevant settings: the unidirectional illumination of NCs on a substrate and the solution case with randomly-oriented NCs (Figure 2a). As illustrated by Figure 1, the HE and photothermal processes are the main driving forces for local photochemical reactions in many experiments with plasmonic NCs. The goal of this paper is to present a consistent and transparent theory describing relevant photophysical and photochemical mechanisms.\n.\nelectron driven anisotropic growth of lead dioxide (PbO2) on gold cuboids leads to the development of a chiral shape.

            "text": "In bulk, predominantly, the low-energy carriers are excited because the excitation of the highenergy electrons is forbidden due to the conservation of the linear momentum (see problem 3 in Ch. 15 in ref. [43]). We regard such carriers as Drude electrons,[14,15,22] which are responsible for the coherent time-oscillating plasmonic currents leading to the plasmon resonance.\nOf course, the main difference from the bulk case for the HE generation in NCs is the impact of the surface. Near the surface, the continuity of the lattice is broken, and correspondingly the conservation law of the linear momentum is not fulfilled, hence the hot carriers may be efficiently generated [44]. In the current literature, one can see numerous examples of the excitation of high-energy electrons in small metal nano-objects.[15,18,35,44,45] We note that the picture in which incident light at the initial absorption step generates mainly carriers with high energies (used for example in ref. [46]) is physically incorrect. One can find the correct picture and related explanation for the bulk case in a classical textbook by Ziman [47] (Ch. 8), and, for the discussion on NCs, one can see our papers of refs. [14,15,22]. The plasmonic wave is composed of coherent low-energy excitations (electron-hole pairs) near the Fermi surface. The acceleration creates those excitations in the Fermi sea, and the resulting plasmon frequency is a parameter incorporating only classical constants (see below for more discussion). The above picture of the dynamic response of conducting solids (the so-called Drude\u2013Sommerfeld model) is a framework commonly presented in university courses. Kinetic theories supporting the Drude-electron picture of the plasmon oscillation can be found in refs. [2,47\u201349]; the above theories are based on various approaches, including classical, semiclassical, and quantum formalisms. For example, the classical Ziman\u2019s text (ref. [47], p. 279, Eq. 8.86) gives the following distribution of excited electrons in the plasmonic wave:\n0\n0( )( , ) 1 i tef Ef t e E i   \u2212= \u2212  \u2212 v E p , where 0 ( )f E is the equilibrium Fermi distribution,  the relaxation time, and 0E is the external electric field. The above equation tells us that the nonequilibrium electrons in a plasmonic wave in a 3D electron gas occupy a narrow energy interval near the fermi level. The\nwidth of this interval is ~ 6 Bk T . This result is commonly found in textbooks on solid-state and condensed-matter physics, including the classical text by Ziman [47] (Ch.8), a recent excellent text by Tanner[2] (Ch.8), and a classical text by Kittel with exemplary quantum solid-state problems[50] (Ch.16).\nOne more note should be made regarding the 2nd-order photon-assisted processes that can create some number of energetic electrons in bulk. Phonon scattering is the leading mechanism\nat room temperature for the Drude electrons and governs the relaxation rate, D , in the Drude dielectric constant.[51] However, those phonon processes are of 1st order in terms of the electronphonon interaction. In that sense, the electron-phonon scattering is a crucial element of electronic dynamics. As it was explained above, Drude electrons, forming the coherent currents\nin the excited plasmon wave, carry low excitation energies, ~ Bk T . In addition to Drude electrons, there is a possibility to create carriers in a 3D crystal with high excitation energies, ~  , via electron-phonon scattering; indeed, the phonon wave breaks the translation symmetry of the lattice, and the electron momentum conservation can be violated in this way. To describe this process, we need to apply 2nd-order perturbation theory, and, correspondingly, such phonon-assisted process should be considered a 2nd-order effect. It is known that these 2ndorder phonon-scattering processes in bulk are weak, and it is challenging to observe them experimentally.[8] Simultaneously, the HEs generated near the surface via the surface quantum mechanism and the interband excitations in a NC are observable and represent strong 1st-order physical effects.[44] Why are the above surface-HE and interband-HH processes so strong and\nmeasurable? (1) A NC may have strong plasmonic hot spots near the surface, which play the role in HE generation sites. (2) Surface-generated HEs can be extracted to an acceptor or transferred directly to the liquid through the surface. Surface charge acceptors, realized in recent experiments, are various, for example: TiO2 clusters, [28] semiconductor films,[8] PbO2 layers, [30] etc. Concerning the interband HHs, we already see that their contribution is very strong simply from looking at the bulk empirical dielectric constant; the physical reason for these prominent transitions is found directly in the periodicity of the crystal lattice. The optical absorption by the interband transitions dominates in the interval 600nm  . Our present theory does not\ndirectly incorporate the photon-induced mechanism of the HE generation in bulk, since this mechanism is weak and challenging to observe. We also note that this weak 2nd-order channel\nof scattering is included in the empirical Drude relaxation constant, D .\nNow we look at the physical contributions to the absorbed power, absP . Considering the\nmain microscopic mechanisms of dissipation in a plasmonic NC (Figure 2c,d), one should split the absorbed power into the following terms:[14,15,20]\nabs Drude interband s,P P P P= + + (4)\nwhere DrudeP , sP , and interbandP are the Drude, surface-scattering, and interband contributions, correspondingly. Each term in Equation (4) represents a specific pathway of energy dissipation in a metal NC (Figure 2c,d)\nThe first and second terms are the fractions of the energy dissipation caused by Drude and\ninterband processes ( DrudeP and interbandP ). Drude dissipation can be computed from the semiclassical Boltzmann theory, which is based on the free-electron model and the relaxation time approximation.[2,47] In a typical metal, the relaxation time at room temperature comes mostly from collisions of the conduction electrons with lattice phonons.[51] The second term\n( interbandP ) in Equation (4) originates from the interband transitions in a noble metal; for gold, it\nbecomes active for 680nm  . Typically, the Drude and interband contributions (see\nEquation (4)) are the main terms responsible for absorption of optical energy in a plasmonic NC; however, in very small NCs, the surface scattering term should dominate.[15] Qualitatively, the origin of the Drude dissipation can be explained in the following semiclassical way. The external electric field provides extra energy to the mobile electrons via classical acceleration, and this extra energy is relatively small in the linear excitation regime. Then, the excited electrons can occupy the states only in the vicinity of the Fermi level; however, since those electrons receive extra energy, they transfer it to the lattice via phonon scattering. Before the collision event, a mobile electron (its center of mass) is moving in space according to classical Newton\u2019s law and its energy oscillates. The kinetic Boltzmann equation provides us with a robust quantitative description leading the dielectric function in the well-known Drude form:[2]\n2 p\nDrude\nD\n( ) 1 ( )i\n  \n   = \u2212 + ,\nwhere D is the Drude broadening parameter and p is the plasmon frequency,\n2\n0 p\n0\ne n\nm   = .\nHere 0n , m and 0 are the electron density, the electron\u2019s mass, and the dielectric permittivity\nof free space, respectively. First, we observe that all quantities in the equation for Drude ( ) \nare of a classical nature, and quantum mechanics seems to be irrelevant. However, the Drude function can also be derived using both quantum and semiclassical formalisms applied directly to the electronic Fermi sea, which is an essentially quantum concept.[2,47\u201349]\nFigures 2c illustrate the bulk processes. The generation rates for the Drude and interband carriers should be computed using quantum kinetic theories.[14,15,22] The Drude electrons and holes (DE and DH in Figure 2e) are generated near the Fermi surface, and the corresponding\nspectral rate shows an intensive peak-dip structure near the Fermi level (see Figure 2e). The interband processes lead to the generation of high-energy d-holes and low-energy electrons in the sp-band (EEdB), as shown on the inset of Figure 2e. Energy efficiencies for the Drude and interband generations can be comparable depending on the shape of a NC.[14]\nFinally, we look at the most interesting mechanism for us. All confined geometries possess a peculiar process - the surface scattering effect, leading to high-energy electrons generation.[44] These nonthermalized high-energy carriers are regarded here as hot electrons. The energy distribution of hot carriers is shown in Figure 2e. Intraband HEs and HHs occupy the wide\ninterval of F FE E E \u2212   + (inset of Figure 2e). Those carriers show a relatively small population in Figure 2e, and the corresponding energy efficiencies for the generation of these carriers are not appreciable.[14,15] The corresponding term in the total absorption rate (Equation (4)) is denoted as sP . Those HEs and HHs are used for surface photoreactions [28].\nIn our previous publications, we developed a convenient computational formalism for obtaining the hot carrier rates.[14,15] Here we treat relatively large NCs, for which the sizequantization effects are not noticeable, and the local dielectric constant approach can be applied. First, we express the dielectric constant in the following way:\n( )\n2 p\nmetal interband\nD s\n2 p\ninterband metal, bulk\nD\n( ) 1 ( ) , [ ]\n( ) ( ) 1 , ( )\ni\ni\n    \n   \n    \n  \n= +  \u2212 + +\n = \u2212 + +\n(5)\nwhere metal, bulk ( )  is the experimental dielectric constant for the bulk material. [52] Furthermore,\ns is the effective plasmonic broadening due to the electron scattering mediated by the surface;\nthis broadening is a quantum parameter.

Correspondingly, the optical cross-sections for the above processes read as\nFor the solution case, our NCs have random orientations. Therefore, we need to average the cross-section in the following fashion:\nx z y x y z z x z y( | ) ( | ) ( | ) ( | ) ( | ) ( | )\nav , 6\nx yk E k E k E k E k E k E        + + + + + = (7)\nwhere xk , yk , and zk are the wavevectors oriented along the three orthogonal axes, and xE ,\nyE , and zE are the corresponding electric-field polarizations of incident light."

We found earlier that these factors play a key\nrole in enhancing HE generation in the near-IR interval when the quantum ( ) 3  \u2212 factor\nrapidly grows. [8,11,53]\nThe HE generation rate ( HERate ) defines the total number of HEs excited inside a NC per second. The second parameter ( high-E HERate ) is defined for the high-energy HE; it gives the rate of excited electrons having over-barrier energies (Figure 2d).[14,54]\n( )\n( )\nNC\nNC\n2 2 2\nF HE , normal32\nS\n2 2 2\nbarF high-E HE , normal42\nS\n1 2 1 ( , ) , 4\n( )1 2 ( , ) , 4\ne E Rate E ds\nEe E Rate E ds\n\n\n   \n  \n \n=  \n\u2212 =  \n\n\n(8)\nwhere , normal ( , )E   is the normal component of the electric field on the surface, inside a NC;\nF 5 eVE = is the Fermi energy for gold. The integral is taken over the surface; barE is the\ninjection barrier energy; in our computations, we will use bar 1 eV,E = which is a typical number for the Au-TiO2 Schottky-barrier. As one can see from Equation (8), high-E HERate\ndescribes the generation of electrons with high (over-barrier) energies, i.e., with barE E  . In a solution setting, the rates (Equation (8)) should be averaged over twelve light configurations.\nOne of the central goals of this paper is to look at the local rates of HE generation at the\nsurface: [14]\n( )\n( )\n2 2 2 2\nHE F HE, surface , normal32\n2 2 2 2high-E HE barF\nhigh-E s HE , noa rmal42, urf ce\n1 2 1 ( ) ( , ) ,\n4\n( )1 2 ( ) ( , ) .\n4\nd N e E r E\ndtds\nd N Ee E r E\ndtds\n\n\n   \n  \n \n= =  \n\u2212 = =  \nr\nr\n(9)\nAs one can see, the units of the above rates are ( )21/ s m .

Below we will use Equation (8-12) to compute various generation mechanisms for a few prominent NC geometries.\nOur approach is COMSOL-based and directly involves the band structure of the metal via\nthe local dielectric constant metal ( )  . This allows us to compute NCs with complex shapes and\nlarge sizes. The band structure of gold is reflected in our theory through the term interband ( )  ,\nwhich has a threshold at 680 nm = . In other words, our approach is based on the empirical dielectric function that should take care of the band-structure effects. Some theoretical ab initio approaches, which are widely celebrated, are Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time Dependent (TD)\u2010DFT. In particular, the TD\u2010DFT is a powerful technique directly solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation incorporating the atomistic Kohn\u2010Sham Hamiltonian.[55] One recent example of a TD-DFT study can be found in Ref. [56]; this paper treats a Ag cluster and explicitly computes the HE distribution, which reveals both the high-energy carriers and the low-energy peaks near the Fermi level (i.e., Drude electrons). In the Supporting information, we discuss some other methods to approach the HE problem such as second-quantization Hamiltonians for the plasmonic degrees of freedom.\nTo conclude this section, we should comment on the nonequilibrium electron populations in an optically driven NC. For the integrated generation rates (Equation (8,12)) the selfconsistent relaxation theory was recently developed by us in ref.[14] The HE rates computed here play the role in local sources of HEs. Furthermore, the high-energy electrons and holes populations also depend on the e-e relaxation time, ( )e e E \u2212 ; [14] this strongly energy-dependent parameter obeys in 3D systems the famous Landau\u2019s law: 2( ) ~ ( )e e FE E E \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 . The present\nstudy does not include the relaxation processes, but we rather look at the other critical elements of the HE generation effect \u2013 the local surface and bulk generation rates. In other words, we show where and how (and via what quantum processes) the optical field generates energetic carriers, which can be used for photochemistry, in a photodetector, or for other applications. Another technologically important relaxation channel is charge transfer through the surface to semiconductor acceptors or molecules in a liquid. Our formalism assumes that the transfer of charge weakly affects the HE processes since our theory deals with the weak excitation limit, which is typical for the plasmonic photochemical studies in the literature. The number of\nextracted electrons is much smaller that the equilibrium number of electrons in a NC, and, therefore, we can neglect the charge-transfer effect for such a linear regime. Some elements of the charge transfer theory can be found in our previous studies of refs. [14,57]. Certainly, the HE transport and relaxation processes in NCs with complex shapes need further development in terms of theory.\nThe generation rates computed here can be applied directly to certain photochemical situations. One example is the chiral growth in ref. [30] that reflects a surface pattern of the electromagnetic field; our recent theory[31] reproduces well such experimental growth (Figure 1b,c). Another example is an experiment with a comparative study of Au NSps, NRs, and NSs; our HE theory based on the generation rates shows that the NS geometry is the most efficient, due to the hot spots on the NS tips. Finally, our local formalism and generation maps explain the experimental results of ref. [28] and should guide more experiments (like a recent study of ref. [32]). For the situations where the transport could essentially influence the photochemical picture, our theory should be able to predict several experimental properties of immediate importance:\n1. The anisotropy and uniformity of the photoreactions on the surface and in solution. 2. The NC geometries that are efficient in terms of the hot electron generation rates. 3. The spectral position-dependent and integral rates of the main hot-carrier mechanisms\n(such as the intraband HE generation and the interband d-hole excitation) in different complex geometries."

One may find the material coefficients used for the optical and thermal computations in Tables S1,S2 (Supporting Information).\nIn our numerical calculations (see the following figures), we found that ( )T r is nearly uniform inside the NCs.[60\u201362] This is due to the very high thermal conductivity of the metal:\nAu waterk k . More precisely, the parameter that should control the uniformity of the local\ntemperature inside the NC, is ,Au transfer/T  , ,AuT and transfer are the characteristic time of\nthermal diffusion inside the Au NC and the time of heat release from the NC to the matrix, respectively. In the Supporting Information, we estimate these time parameters and observe that\n, Au transfer/ ~ 0.006T  for a NC of eff 15 nmR = . The above property, i.e., ,Au transfer/ 1T  ,\nensures that the phototemperature should be nearly uniform within the metal component.\nHowever, the above property (i.e., ( )T constr within the NC) has certain limitations, of\ncourse (Supporting Information). Briefly, this property is found in relatively small NCs for\nwhich the near-field approximation is valid. For large NCs and metastructures, the temperature gradients within the metal can be strong and drive surface photochemistry locally.[63,64] One insightful case is a \u201cshuriken\u201d metastructure with long arms where the phototemperature is strongly nonuniform and the photochemical processes are position dependent.[64]\nWe also should consider our results in the context of the lattice and electronic temperatures\n( LT and eT ).\n[65,66] Such a two-temperature (2T) model was widely employed to describe time-\ndependent phenomena in NCs.[10,22] Our formalism based on the local differential equation (Equation (13)) has a single temperature that should be considered as the common temperature\nof the lattice and electrons, since under CW excitation L eT T . This condition comes from the\nfact that the electron-phonon relaxation in a metal is fast. Namely, e ph transfer \u2212 , where e ph \u2212\nthe electron-phonon relaxation time in a NC. For Au NCs, experiments typically show: e-ph 0.5ps . [7,12] Considering our NCs with eff 15 nm,R = we have for the transfer time: transfer ~ 310ps . Then, we find that -3 e ph transfer/ ~1.6\u00d710 <<1 \u2212 . Therefore, in this case the\nelectronic and lattice temperatures should be very close to each other, and the single temperature approach is fully applicable. In other words, L eT T T=  . As the last comment on our thermal treatment, we should mention that the calculated parameter ( )T r is the local\nphototemperature created by a single NC. In a typical experiment with NC solutions, the actual\ntemperature around a single NC is made of two contributions: tot coll( ) ( ) ,T T T =  +r r where\ncollT is the collective excess temperature created by the rest of the NC ensemble in a solution;[60,61,67] this term does not vary noticeably in space in the vicinity of a given NC.

            "text": "Now we look at the computational data obtained with the help of COMSOL Multiphysics. We assume that our NCs are on a substrate and illuminated from one direction. To compare different shapes consistently, all NCs in our calculations will have the same volume, characterized by the effective radius.\n3\nNC eff\n4\n3 RV\n =\nIn all subsequent figures, we present NCs with eff 15nmR = . Assuming a glass substrate and water as two adjacent media, we adopt a model with a uniform matrix of averaged dielectric\nconstant ( env 2 = ). Indeed, the optical constant of glass and water are close, and this approach should provide us with reliable results.[68]\nFigure 3a,b show both optical cross-sections and HE generation rates. The optical absorptions contain the contributions from the interband transitions, Drude-like dissipation, and surface-mediated electron scattering (HE generation). As expected, the plasmon resonance shows excellent tunability with the NC shape. We also observe that the NR geometry is strongly anisotropic, whereas the NSps, NCubes, and NSs show nearly isotropic cross-sections and integrated rates. We also note that the d-hole interband process is active mostly for the NSp geometry, appearing in the interval of 680 nm  .\nNext, we compute the microscopic photophysical properties under polarized excitation (Figures 4 and 5). First, we see a striking difference between the surface maps for the phototemperature and the HE generation in Figure 4. The surface phototemperature is nearly uniform over the NC, whereas the HE rates show very strong variance and anisotropy. The reason comes directly from the physical mechanisms underlying them. The steady state phototemperature originates from the heat diffusion process; therefore, since the thermal conductivity is really high in the metal, this magnitude is nearly uniform within the crystal volume. More precisely, here we should compare two thermal diffusion times, for which we\nsee that ,Au transfer/ 1T  , i.e., the thermal diffusion time inside the NC is much shorter than the\ntime of heat escape from the NC (see the Supporting Information for estimates). Simultaneously, the local surface HE generation rate in Figure 4 is strongly anisotropic since it is given by the function 2\n, normal ( , )E   (Equation (9)). For the simplest NSp geometry, it\nreflects the polarization of the incident field (Figure 4a). For the other geometries in Figure 4, as expected, one can see the formation of plasmonic hot spots near the surfaces with strongly enhanced HE rates; the strongest hot spots occur for the NS case.[14,40] Since the distributions for the phototemperature and HE rate are so different, we should expect that the distributions of the local photochemical reactivity should also be very different for those mechanisms. Indeed, the experiments on surface photo-growth on a substrate show a striking variety of regimes. The photo-growth on a substrate in ref. [37] was interpreted as a purely plasmonic thermal mechanism. Indeed, the growth was isotropic,[37] and its speed correlated with the total absorption by the nano-antenna composed of three nanoparticles. Within a single element of the nanoantenna in ref. [37], the temperature distribution is expected to be uniform; however, the plasmonic hot-spot effect can strongly enhance the phototemperature on one of the elements. We note that similar conclusions for the phototemperature generation were made theoretically by us in Ref. [59]. A remarkably different photo-growth regime can be found in ref. [30]. This case is shown in Figure 1b; circularly polarized light under unidirectional excitation creates a prominent chiral distortion of the NC shape via surface photo-growth induced by plasmonic HEs. Such chiral growth appears in the above-mentioned paper [30] as an interplay of the chiral light and the anisotropic NC geometry. Regarding chiral growth, there are requirements for the symmetry of a NC: (1) if a NC is achiral, its geometrical cross section has to break rotational symmetry; i.e., a chiral distortion will not appear for spherical NCs;[31,54] (2) if a NC is chiral from the beginning, chiral photochemical effects (growth or surface chemistry) will be strongly enhanced.[32,54]\nNowadays, chiral plasmonic photochemistry is a very active area, rapidly expanding as one can see from refs [30,32,69,70].\nFigure 5 gives a data summary for the mechanism involving the excitation of high-energy d-holes, in which incident photons promote the transitions from the d-band to the sp-band in gold (Figure 2c,d). The generation in this case takes place in bulk and, correspondingly, we plot cross sections of the 3D maps of the process. The local generation rate (power) is proportional to\n*\ninterband \u03c9 \u03c9Im( )  E E . (14)\nThe interband ( )  function should be carefully extracted from the empirical dielectric constant by separating from the Drude contribution that dominates in the long wavelength limit (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information here and the formalism in ref. [14]). Even though the process is bulk-like, the generation rate can vary strongly inside a NC (Figure 5). Again, its shape matters: a spherical shape has a uniform rate distribution, whereas anisotropic NCs with hot spots show very strong variations of the local generation rates. An experimental study in ref. [17] (Figure 1e) presents an elegant method to separate the photoheating and the d-hole effects; in which the authors combined single-particle optical spectroscopy at different illumination wavelengths, transmission electron microscopy, and thermal characterization. It was found that the process of growth is isotropic and induced by the d-hole generation; the photothermal mechanism was excluded. This observation is fully consistent with our results in Figure 5 for the simplest NSp geometry; the pattern of the d-hole excitation is nearly uniform everywhere inside the NC. However, the above behavior of the NSps is drastically different from NCs with complex shapes (Figure 5). The local d-hole generation in anisotropic NCs in Figure 5 is strongly nonuniform. To illustrate this effect, we plot the d-hole rate along selected lines, which are located at different distances to the surface (0, 2.5, 5 nm). In a photochemical experiment,\nincident light first generates the d-holes in the bulk of the NC. Afterwards, these generated carriers with high energy propagate in all directions, and we are interested in the carriers reaching the surface. Due to their fast relaxation, a d-hole should lose its energy as it propagates away from the generation point, and this process is typically an exponential function of the travelled distance. Therefore, d-holes created near the surface have higher chances to reach the surface and to participate in surface photochemistry. Consequently, the regions with high rates near the surface (see the bulk maps in Figure 5) should indicate the corresponding increased reactivity at the surface.\nLooking at the different NC shapes in Figure 5, we conclude that the highest numbers of excited d-holes are expected near the tips for NRs and NSs (the hot spot regions) and at the two opposite sides for the NCubes. Having strong anisotropy of the d-hole generation in the vicinity of the surface, one should expect a non-uniform distribution of the related reactivity, either driving NC growth or another photoreaction.\nTo conclude this section, we note that photochemistry on a substrate with unidirectional illumination shows some striking differences to that in a solution. However, these two settings also have much in common. For example, in both cases plasmonic hot spots play an important role;[28,71] Figures 1a,b,h present a few interesting examples of plasmonic hot-spot photoreactions. The advantage of the substrate setting lies in the possibility of studying singleparticle spectroscopy and microscopy, and the latter one allows us to directly observe shape and size transformations [30,36,37] with the aid of various local microscopy means (TEM, SEM, AFM, etc.);\nthe red arrow.

Here we show both the total rates and the rates for the over-barrier electrons; the barrier energy is 1 eV.\n4. Hot-electron generation in a solution.\nExperimentally, the most accessible and well-reported setting for plasmonic NCs is in solution, of course. Here, the two experimental settings, shown Figure 2a, represent two models, which include unidirectional excitation of a NC on a substrate (model 1) and randomly oriented NCs in a solution phase (model 2). Importantly, one can notice a few fundamental differences between these two models when considering surface photochemistry. Figures 4 and 5 show the substrate case, and Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9 present the data for the solution model. In the solution model, we illuminate our NCs from orthogonal directions and then find average values.\nFor the far-field cross-sections, it suffices to use the three directions (x, y, and z) and overall, six configurations, as reflected in Equation (7). For the near-field responses, such as the HE rates and phototemperature, one should use all six incidence directions and twelve configurations in total:[14]\nav 0 av 06 configurations 12 configurations ( , ) , ( , ) .Rate Rate = =k E k E\nThen, by using the averaged values, the whole picture of optoelectronic phenomena for NCs with various shape is recovered, including the energy efficiencies.[14]\ns HEs HEs\nabs scat abs scat\n, ( ) /\nP Rate Eff\nP P P P  = = + +\nHigh-E HEss High-E HEs\nabs scat abs scat\n, ( ) /\nRateP Eff\nP P P P  = = + +\ninterband d-holes d-holes\nabs scat abs scat\n.

In particular, Figure 7 provides us with the efficiencies of the shapes at the plasmonic peaks; a detailed discussion on the efficiencies can be found in our previous paper, ref. [14]. The efficiencies were computed using the nonlinear self-consistent approach based on the Kreibig\u2019s parameter, s (see Equation (5) and Ref. [14]). Below we list\nthe characteristic physical properties of the kinetic mechanisms computed by us. (1) The interband HE generation originates from the inelastic surface-assisted scattering (the Kreibig\u2019s mechanism [44]). This process is strongly enhanced in the red and infrared spectral intervals, [8,11,22] and it is also strongly promoted at plasmonic hot spots.[39,40] In the red spectral interval, the plasmonic field-enhancement effect is especially strong because the plasmon resonance does not overlap with the interband transitions.[7,20] Another reason for the enhanced intraband HE generation in the red is the ( ) 3  \u2212 factor in Equation (8) for the rate. The above factor is\nof quantum origin and arises from the matrix elements, which describe the breaking of linear moment conservation at the surface.[15] Such an optoelectronic response is widely used for nanostructured photodetectors [72]. (2) The d-hole processes are active for 680 nm  and dominate the absorption cross-section for the NSp at the plasmonic peak. (3) Drude carriers are\nnonequilibrium electrons with low excitation energies, which form the coherent plasmonic currents in a NC; those carriers are well described by the semi-classical Drude model. (4) The\nphotothermal efficiencies ( TEff , Equation (15)) are always high for small sizes, as also shown\nin Figure 7b; the reasons for such behavior are the fast relaxation of high-energy carriers and the low light-scattering cross-sections for small NCs.\nLooking at the above hot-carrier mechanism (1-4), the intraband HE generation, i.e., Kreibig\u2019s surface mechanism,[44] is probably the most special process occurring in plasmonic nanostructures, and more so in complex-shape NCs with hot spots. Indeed, hot-spot driven photoreactions and anisotropic growth are prominent phenomena observed in several impressive experiments, which also utilized local microscopies (such as TEM, SEM, etc.).[19,49,73] Figure 1h,j shows two examples of such experimental work.\nFinally, Figures 8 and 9 present the key results for the model of NCs in solution. First, we should look at the spherical NC, and we see the fundamental difference between the solution and substrate models (Figure 4a,c). Of course, the case with randomly oriented NSp has no surface and bulk anisotropies for the surface HEs and d-holes, whereas the substrate case in Figure 4a,c reflects the incident-field orientation. Importantly, the anisotropy of the HE generation remains very strong for all NCs with complex shapes, even in solution; as seen in Figures 8 and 9, the surface and bulk maps for the HE generation rates reflect plasmonic hot spots appearing at tips and apexes. However, the symmetry of the maps is higher for the solution case and reflects the NC topology. Whereas, for the polarized-excitation case, the symmetry of the spatial maps is lower, because of the incident field polarization (Figures 4 and 5). The above properties hold for all high-energy HE generation mechanisms, including surface HEs and dholes. For the generation of low-energy Drude electrons, we also see a similar behavior - see the Supporting Information (Figures S2 and S3). Again, the temperature generation maps are nearly uniform for the solution case (Figure 8).\nThe spatial distributions of hot carrier excitation and phototemperature determine how the chemical reactivity is distributed over the surface of the NC and how it would grow in the right environment. Our photophysical formalism allows us to compute such properties. One example of photochemistry in solution is a recent work on plasmonic photometry with TiN-Pt hybrids;[38] the above study deals with the NCube geometry and demonstrates that both photochemical mechanisms (intraband HEs and photoheating) are active simultaneously. The NCube geometry in ref. [38] indeed has the hot spot areas located at the apexes of the cube (Figure 8a), and it is where most of the photochemical activity should take place. The role of hot spots for NC photocatalysis in a solution can be revealed by comparing different geometries and materials. Such a study was done experimentally in ref. [28,42] and theoretically in refs. [14,40]. To see the shape effects, the authors of ref. [28] compared the photocatalytic efficiencies of NSps, NRs, and NSs. The photocatalytic material efficiency, introduced by us in Refs. [14,28], was defined as\nchem NC/Rate m , where chemRate and NCm are the photochemical rate and NC mass, respectively.\nImportantly, the best performance was found for the plasmonic NSs, because of the strong fieldenhancement effect at the nanostar tips.[14,40,71]\nPlasmonic d-hole photocatalysis is another ongoing research direction.[18,33,74,75] It has been studied mostly by using spherical NCs made of Au and Ag. Importantly, this kind of photochemistry of NCs does not directly follow the plasmonic-field enhancement in a NC,\nbecause the d-hole rate includes another important multiplier:  interbandIm  (see Equation (12,\n14)). The resulting curve for the rate receives a prominent shoulder in the blue region (see Figure 7a for the NSp case). This behavior agrees well with the experimental photocatalytic data reported in ref. [18]; we note here that our paper of ref. [14] has a detailed comparison between the experimental d-hole data,[18] d-hole theory, and field-enhancement factor. Remarkably, the d-hole photochemical processes in Au and Ag NSps allow us to realize a family of carbon-based photoreactions observed with the aid of single-particle SERS.[75]\nPhotochemical kinetic behaviors are always intricate and intriguing - one example is the recent observation of nonlinear and stochastic dynamics in plasmonic photocatalysis.[74]\nconfigurations, as described in the text.

Conclusions\nCurrently, the field of plasmonic photocatalysis enjoys much interest and is gathering many exciting research results.[17,30,35,36,73,74,76\u201379] Here we presented a theoretical formalism allowing us to compute local photochemical and photophysical properties for plasmonic NCs with complex shapes. The theory is based on the numerical solution of an integral nonlinear equation for the Kreibig\u2019s plasmon-decay parameter, S , [14,79] which can be achieved using a variety of\nstandard software tools. As an example, one convenient computational tool, used here by us, is COMSOL Multiphysics. The most interesting behaviors appear, of course, for NCs with hot spots, where the local photophysical hot-carrier response becomes strongly enhanced. There is a striking difference between the local distributions of hot-carrier generation and phototemperature. Whereas the local intraband HE and d-hole rates are typically anisotropic and non-uniform in space, the local plasmonic phototemperature in small NCs is always nearly uniform, due to the metal\u2019s high thermal conductivity. Regarding the local distributions of the nonequilibrium properties, it is important to compute the setting with a substrate and the solution case separately. For example, the hot carrier's maps for small spherical NPs are uniform for the intraband HEs (solution) and interband HHs (both solution and substrate settings). In contrast, those maps are non-uniform (anisotropic) for spherical NCs in the substrate model. Furthermore, in most cases, the symmetry of the hot-carrier maps is different in the solution and substrate settings. Finally, we comment that noble metals, such as Au, Ag, and Cu, serve as model systems, but our theory applies to a wide range of conductors with plasmonic\nresponses.[80] To give a few examples, one should mention the TiN and ZrN material systems [38,81] and various hybrid nanostructures.[82,83]\nSupporting Information Supporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author."

            "text": "The thermal transport equation in the main text (Equation 13) provides us with a microscopic description of the phototemperature distribution. This equation should be solved numerically. However, it is possible to estimate analytically the important time scales defined in the main text ( ,Au transfer/T  and ,Au transfer/T  ). For the heat diffusion time inside the metal, we just employ the standard equation of the diffusion length: diff Aul K t= , where Au Au Au Au/ ( )K k c = is the thermal diffusivity of gold. Then, taking diff effl R= , we obtain the heat diffusion time in the NC:\n2\neff ,Au\nAu\nT\nR\nK  = . Then, we are getting: ,Au 1.8psT = for eff 15 nmR = . As expected, this time is short since gold is an excellent conductor of heat \u2013 almost \u201ca superconductor\u201d. How to estimate the heat release time, i.e., ,Au transfer/T  ? For this, one can employ the phenomenological energy-balance approach:\nNC NC NC\ntransfer\n( ) , U U\nQ t t \n  = \u2212\n (S1)\nwhere NC w Au NCU c V T =  is the heat accumulated by the NC, and NC ( )Q t is the total absorption power of a NC; NCV and T are the NC volume and the average temperature inside the NC, respectively. We note that the approach of Equation (S1) was widely used a lot in both experimental and theoretical papers (e.g., see Refs. [S5\u2013S7]). Then, for the CW regime, we should have NC / 0U t  = and\nNC NC\ntransfer\n0 U\nQ \n \u2212 = . (S2)\nIn the steady state, the phototemperature at the surface of a spherical NC is:\nNC surface\nwater eff\n1\n4\nQ T\nk R  = .\nAnd, using Equation (S2), and since surfaceT T   , we obtain the following equation:\n2 2\neff Au Au eff transfer Au Au\nwater w w water\n1 1 3 3 R c R c k c K     = = . (S3)\nThe above expression is very useful as an estimate. For our conditions and eff 15 nmR = , transfer 310ps = . The letter is consistent with the available time-resolved experimental data. [S8] As expected, we observe that ,Au transfer/ 1T  . Strictly speaking, Equation S3 was derived for a spherical NC; however, one can use this equation to estimate the heat release time for an arbitrary NC shape.\nAs we observe, NCs with complex shapes, like nanostars and nanocubes, possess a stronglynonuniform distribution of heat generation, i.e., ( )localq r . Therefore, for large sizes, we should expect a nonuniform temperature generation in a NC. To analyze this situation, we need to look at the parameter ( ) characterizing the temperature variance ( T ) inside an NC:\n2 eff\nAu water w w ,Au transfer 2\nAu Au eff Au Au Au\nw w water\n/ 3 ( ) 1\n3\nT eff\nR K K c f R c R K c c K        = = =  .\nFirst, we see that this parameter does not depend on the size, and it seems that T should be small for a NC of arbitrary size. However, one should note that the above result is valid only under certain conditions, which are the following: (a) An NC should be of a quasi-spheric shape, where the irregularities do not play an essential role in a spatial T-distribution. (b) An NC should have a small size when the near-field approximation is valid. In this case, the electric field can still be strongly nonuniform due to hot spots (see our data for nanostars and nanocubes); however, the electromagnetic field is not shielded by the NC, and the field distribution does not depend essentially on the k vector.\nIn general, large NCs behave differently. For large sizes, the electromagnetic field will be shielded by the NC, and the energy dissipation will appear only on one side of the NC. We can see it for large spheres treated within the Mie theory.[S9\u2013S11] Therefore, for large sizes and complex geometries with narrow spaces, one should be careful using the above estimates, which were made for small, quasi-spherical NCs. For example, in the case of a nano-shuriken in Ref. [S12], the T-distribution along the thin and long Au arms is strongly nonuniform; this property was confirmed both experimentally and theoretically. The length of the thin arms in the above shuriken structure ~ 150 nm. To conclude, large plasmonic structures with strong electrodynamic effects, complex surfaces, and narrow spaces can show strongly nonuniform Tdistributions."

            "text": "Our COMSOL-based formalism developed here utilizes Kreibig\u2019s idea of a modified local dielectric function incorporating the quantum parameter s . This parameter should be carefully evaluated from the integral equation for complex geometries. Together with the Drude and dhole generations, the surface-assisted intraband HE mechanism forms a closed set of physical parameters to describe the hot-e problem of a plasmonic NC. The justification of our approach comes directly from the equation of motion for the density matrix.[S13] Of course, there are many more approaches to this problem, and we will name here a few.\nFirst, we should mention celebrated ab initio methods, DFT and TD-DFT, solving the atomistic Kohn-Sham Hamiltonians directly.[S14] The figure below shows the TD-DFT calculation of a Ag cluster exhibiting both HEs and Drude electrons from Ref [S15] (for the earlier paper by the same group, please see Ref. [S16]). The appearance of the Drude electrons indicates the formation of the plasmon wave. However, this Ag cluster is still tiny (~ few nanometers), and the Drude peaks are not overwhelming; in NCs with sizes >10nm, the amplitude of the Drude peaks at low energies in the HE distribution grows dramatically.\nFigure S4: HE distributions from the ab initio TD-DFT of a Ag cluster from Ref. [S15]. Reproduced with permission.[S15] Copyright 2020, American Chemical Society.\nAnother stream of papers on HEs utilizes the rate derived initially from the quantum equations of motion; such a rate should incorporate a phonological relaxation time  .[S17,S18] On the other hand, our formalism[S2, S13] is intrinsically more complex (originating from the equation of motion for the density matrix) and incorporates more relaxation parameters and also relaxation\nintegrals.[S2,S13] Overall, the results of Refs. [S2,S13,S17] and [S18] are qualitatively similar and agree with the ab initio TD-DFT picture in Ref. [S15] (Figure S4).\nA field-theory approach (i.e., second quantization) for plasmonic fields was introduced a long time ago \u2013 please see a chapter in this classical text.[S19] For NCs, the second quantization (together with the Lindblad relaxation operator) was successfully used in Ref. [S20], treating nontrivial exciton-plasmon settings in the nonlinear Rabi-Fano regime. Futhermore, the fieldtheory approach was combined with the ab initio DFT-calculated electron wavefunctions in plasmonic slabs in Refs. [S21,S22]. Ref. [S21] focuses on the interband absorption in a Ag slab; this theory starts from the second quantization of surface-plasmon polaritons and the formulation of the plasmon-electron field operator. The second-quantization formalism is, of course, based on the phenomenological local dielectric function. It is a hybrid approach allowing us to see the distribution of interband electrons and holes. Ref. [S22] used a similar methodology but combined the atomistic DFT for wavefunctions with the electron-phonon field operators. Of course, the above short notes are not a comprehensive review of quantum theories of plasmon excitations and plasmonic HEs, which have a long history.\nReferences [S1] P. B. Johnson, R. W.
