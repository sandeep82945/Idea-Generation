Estimation of the stage-wise costs of breast cancer in Germany using a modeling approach 1. conclusions can be derived regarding average and total costs for the population. To better understand the economic burden of BC and take into account that patients can have multiple comorbidities, it is critical to determine the costs attributable to the diagnosis of BC. Ideally, costs are collected from detection to end-of-life and the estimated costs compared to those of a control group without breast cancer. Instead of a control group, and depending on data availability, the selection of only a subset of costs that are related to the particular diagnosis can be considered. Despite being the more consistent method, micro-costing is also more resource-intensive since it requires a rich and detailed database codified (not just using the ICD 10 classification but also with clinical information) so that it is possible to determine BC attributable costs. The costs can be collected based on resource use, unit price, charges (bills), or reimbursement data. The first and the second data sources depend on the selection, follow-up, and recruitment of patients, which can be costly and usually not representative of the entire population that suffers from the disease (e.g., a sample of patients from selected hospitals or a clinical trial). If patients are selected from only one particular geographic area, results might not generalize to the entire population since care costs vary across treatment centers (specialized treatment centers vs. usual care centers) (19). The alternative is to use administrative data from Statutory Health Insurance (SHI). Depending on the population coverage, it can be representative, and, in addition, attributable costs can be estimated. However, in most countries, administrative data is not easy to access, and the use of the information is highly limited by strict confidentiality regulations, as it is in Germany. Furthermore, a critical limitation of most administrative databases is that they do not include or can not be linked to clinical information.  It is estimated that the overall cost among younger cancer patients is 20% to 50% higher compared to all patients for the initial and terminal phases of care (50). The higher costs may be attributed to the aggressive BC care in young women because they are more likely to be diagnosed with BC stages
II and III (stage 2 BC: 44.3 vs. 29.9%, respectively; stage 3 BC: 14.0 vs. 7.7%, respectively), triple-negative BC (21.2 vs. 13.8%, respectively), and HER2-positive (HER2+: 26.0 vs. 18.6%, respectively) compared to middle-aged women (50, 51). Therefore, future studies should consider age while estimating stage-wise costs. We recognize that the modeling study is subject to limitations. First, the model only accounts for incident cases. Therefore, the cost of surveillance, mainly governed by prevalent BC (314, 546; 5-years prevalence in 2015) (8) cases, is underestimated. For example, the model estimates of the intermediate phase (e851) are inconsistent with Kreis et al. (36) estimates of e2,528. Also, the model estimate of e1.81 billion in medical costs of BC incident cases for 2015 is not in line with the overall economic burden (e2.15 billion in costs for female BC cases in Germany in 2015) (2). Second, the German cancer registry does not provide information on BC progression, recurrence, or associated treatment pathways. This resulted in the model being unable to account for recurrence and progression costs. Consequently, the costs associated with intermediate phase and stages were underestimated. Third, the modeling study relied on multiple data sources to estimate stage-wise costs, and the approach is prone to uncertainties and variability. Fourth, a modeling study could not reflect the heterogeneity and complexity of the management of BC in different health settings (e.g., specialized BC treatment centers vs. usual healthcare settings). Nonetheless, in the absence of documented clinical information needed to estimate stage-wise costs, these modeling methods could offer feasible estimates of the cost of care. 5. conclusion The literature review did not identify any study published in Germany for stage-wise costs of BC. This reflects fundamental shortfalls in the German data collection methods and data
