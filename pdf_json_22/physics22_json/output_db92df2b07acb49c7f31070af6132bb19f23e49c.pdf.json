The current research on the anomalous spatial shift in interface electronic reflection is based on the paradigm of linear approximation, under which the center position of the incident and reflected beams are obtained by expanding the phases of relevant basis states and scattering amplitudes to the first order of incident momentum. However, in a class of normal cases, the linear approximation can lead to a divergent spatial shift in reflection for certain incident angles even though the corresponding reflection possibility is finite. In this work, we show that such non-physical results are caused by an abrupt change in the number of the propagating states at critical parameters, and can be resolved by calculating the center positions of the scattering beams beyond the linear approximation. Moreover, we find that the beam width has an important influence on the spatial shift near the critical angles. We demonstrate our idea via concrete calculations of Goos-Ha\u0308nchen and Imbert-Fedorov shift on two representative models. These results are beneficial for clarifying the scope of application of the linear approximation in the study of anomalous spatial shifts.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAccording to the laws of reflection in geometric optics, one knows that the incident point is always the same as the point where the light beam is reflected back at a sharp interface. However, due to the wave nature of photons, these law should be revised in certain cases and a light beam can experience an anomalous spatial shift under reflection, namely, there exists a shift between the incident and the reflected beams at the interface [1]. Generally, the spatial shift is divided into longitudinal and transverse components with respect to the incident plane, known as the Goos-Ha\u0308nchen shift [2, 3] and Imbert-Fedorov shift [4\u20136], respectively. Since the wave-particle duality is a foundational concept in physics and holds for all particles, the anomalous spatial shift can also be found in many other particles, such as electrons [7\u201311], atoms [12] and neutrons [13].\nIn electronic systems, the valence and conduction bands can cross around Fermi level, leading to nontrivial band degeneracy [14\u201322]. The band degeneracies in three-dimensional (3D) topological semimetals have many different types, and can be classified as 0D nodal point, 1D nodal line and 2D nodal surface [23\u2013 25]. Remarkably, in the interface constructed by topological semimetals and other systems, both longitudinal and transverse shift effects are generally significant, due to strong (pseudo-)spin-orbit coupling in topological semimetals [8, 26\u201329]. Such significant anomalous\n\u2217 xinxingzhou@hunnu.edu.cn \u2020 zhiming yu@bit.edu.cn\nspatial shift can lead to various physical consequences, such as chirality-dependent Hall effect [27] and modifying the dispersion of the confined waveguide modes [8]. Moreover, the behavior of the longitudinal and transverse shifts in these systems has a strong dependence on the species of the band degeneracies [26\u201329]. For example, when a beam comes from normal metal onto the interface with topological Weyl semimetals, there will exist quantum vortices in the vector field of the spatial shift in the interface momentum space, and the number of the quantum vortices is determined by the topological charge of the Weyl points [30]. The anomalous shifts can also be realized in Andreev reflection, during which the incident particle changes its identity from electron to hole [31\u201334]. Similarly, the shifts strongly depend on the pair potential of the superconductors, which in turn can be used to probe the superconducting states.\nCurrently, the standard and the most general approach used to study the anomalous shifts in electronic systems is the quantum scattering approach under linear approximation [11]. In this approach, the incident beam is modeled by wave packet \u03a8, which is constructed by the incident basis states \u03c8i(k) and is confined in both real and momentum spaces (rc,kc). During scattering, the wave packet would be reconstructed, as each incident basis state \u03c8i(k) is scattered into reflected basis state \u03c8r(k) with certain reflection amplitude. The anomalous shifts then are obtained by comparing the center position of the incident and reflected beams. In practice, one generally chooses the wave-packet profile to have a Gaussian form, and in such case, the anomalous shifts can be analytically obtained by expanding the phases of the relevant scattering basis states [\u03c8i(k) and \u03c8r(k)] and reflection ar X iv :2\n21 2.\n07 30\n7v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n1 2\nD ec\n2 02\n2\n2 amplitudes to the linear order around kc. The linear approximation is valid for most cases and gives accurate analytical results, which are helpful for gaining insight into the physics of the shifts. However, for a class of normal cases, the linear approximation leads to a divergence of the anomalous shifts in reflection at certain incident angles, even when the corresponding reflection possibility is finite [8, 26, 33]. Then two important questions arise: Under what conditions, does the linear approximation not apply? And how to resolve the divergence of the shifts?\nIn this work, we show that the divergence of the shifts in linear approximation are closely related to an abrupt change of the number of propagating states. In scattering, while the number of the scattering states is fixed, the number of the propagating states is not, and may abruptly changes when some critical parameters like incident angle or Fermi energy change. This abrupt change would lead to a singularity in reflection amplitude or its derivative, which in the framework of linear approximation inevitably results in divergent anomalous shifts. We show this divergence can be resolved by calculating the centre position of the incident and reflected beams beyond the linear approximation. We explicitly demonstrate our idea by calculating the longitudinal (GoosHa\u0308nchen) and transverse (Imbert-Fedorov) shifts on two representative models. Our work will be beneficial for clarifying the scope of application of the linear approximation in the study of anomalous spatial shifts."

            "text": "Consider a general model which contains two media respectively described by Hamiltonian H1 and H2, and a flat interface between these two media, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). We also assume that the junction model is extended along y and z directions, indicating that ky and kz are conserved quantities during scattering. A beam of particles is incoming from the region of x < 0 (H1) and is scattered at the interface residing at x = 0 plane. Besides, there is a rotation angle \u03b1 between the incident plane and the y axis, as shown in Fig. 1(b).\nTo define the anomalous spatial shift, the incident beam should be modeled by a wave packet, which is required to be confined in both real and momentum spaces. We choose the wave-packet profile to have a Gaussian form. Then, an incident wave packet centred at kc = (kcy, k c z) can be written as [8, 11]\n\u03a8i(r,kc) = \u222b w (k \u2212 kc)\u03c8i(k)dk, (1)\nwhere \u03c8i(k) = eik\u00b7r|ui(k)\u3009 is the Bloch eigenstate of the incident medium and |ui(k)\u3009 is the cell-periodic part of the eigenstate. The wave-packet profile w reads\nw(k) = \u220f i=y,z (\u221a 2\u03c0Wi )\u22121 e\u2212k 2 i /(2W 2 i ), (2)\nx\nz y\nincidence reflection\n(a) (b)\nH1 H2\nPlane of incidence\nPlane of reflection\n\u03b8 T L\nx0\n\u03b1\ny\nz\nTL\nFIG. 1. (a) Schematic figure showing the anomalous spatial shift ` in interface scattering. (b) Top view of the y-z plane in (a).\nwhere Wi denotes the Gaussian width for the i-th component, controlling the beam width in momentum space. The centre position of the incident beam can be written as [35, 36]\nrci (k c) = \u222b r|\u03a8i(r,kc)|2dr\u222b |\u03a8i(r,kc)|2dr . (3)\nWhen the incident beam hits the interface, each partial wave \u03c8i(k) is scattered into reflected basis state \u03c8r(k) with certain k-dependent reflection amplitude Ar(k). The reflection amplitude here is obtained by the standard quantum scattering approach. Then, the reflected beam also is a wave packet and can be expressed as\n\u03a8r(r,kc) = \u222b w (k \u2212 kc)Ar(k)\u03c8r(k)dk, (4)\nand its centre position is\nrcr(k c) = \u222b r|\u03a8r(r,kc)|2dr\u222b |\u03a8r(r,kc)|2dr . (5)\nBy comparing the centre position of incident and reflected beam, the anomalous shift in reflection is obtained as\n`(kc) = rcr(k c)\u2212 rci (kc), (6)\nwhich is a vector and forms a vector field in the interface momentum space. However, it should be noticed that based on Eq. (6), while one always can numerically obtain `(kc), it is impossible to obtain an analytical expression for `(kc), which prevents a deep understanding of the physics underlying the shifts. To resolve this problem, one has to resort to linear approximation, as it can give an analytical expression of `(kc) in many cases.\nThe Bloch eigenstate of the incident medium may include multiple (N) components, i.e. |ui(r)(k)\u3009 = (u i(r) 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7uiN )T , then the wave packets \u03a8i(r) should also have N components. The n-th component of \u03a8i and \u03a8r are respectively expressed as\n\u03a8in(r,k c) = \u222b w (k \u2212 kc) eik\u00b7r|uin(k)|ei\u03c6 i n(k)dk, (7)\n3 and\n\u03a8rn(r,k c) = \u222b w (k \u2212 kc) |Ar|ei\u03d5(k)eik\u00b7r|urn(k)|ei\u03c6 r n(k)dk,\n(8)\nwith \u03c6 i(r) n (k) = arg[u i(r) n (k)] and \u03d5(k) = arg[Ar(k)]. In the framework of linear approximation, the two phases \u03c6 i(r) n (k) and \u03d5(k) in Eq. (7) and Eq. (8) are replaced by the first order Taylor series expanded around kc,\n\u03c6i(r)n (k) = \u03c6 i(r) n (k c) + (k \u2212 kc) \u00b7 \u2202k\u03c6i(r)n |k=kc , (9) \u03d5(k) = \u03d5(kc) + (k \u2212 kc) \u00b7 \u2202k\u03d5|k=kc . (10)\nWith the linear approximation, one can find that Eqs. (7) and (8) will take the following forms\n\u03a8in(r,k c) \u221d e\u2212\u03c3 2 y(y+\u2202ky\u03c6 i n|k=kc ) 2/2\n\u00d7e\u2212\u03c3 2 z(z+\u2202kz\u03c6 i n|k=kc ) 2/2, (11)\n\u03a8rn(r,k c) \u221d e\u2212\u03c3 2 y(y+\u2202ky (\u03c6 r n+\u03d5)|k=kc ) 2/2\n\u00d7e\u2212\u03c3 2 z(z+\u2202kz (\u03c6 r n+\u03d5)|k=kc ) 2/2, (12)\nindicating that \u03a8in and \u03a8 r n are centred at \u2212\u2202k\u03c6in|k=kc and \u2212\u2202k(\u03c6rn +\u03d5)|k=kc , respectively. The centre position of incident and reflected beams are the average of all components, written as\nrci = \u2212 \u2211 n win\u2202k\u03c6 i n|k=kc (13)\nrcr = \u2212 \u2211 n wrn\u2202k(\u03c6 r n + \u03d5)|k=kc , (14)\nwith w i(r) n the weight of the n-th component of |ui(r)\u3009, satisfying \u2211 n(w i(r) n )2 = 1. Hence, the anomalous shift from linear approximation can be analytically expressed as the difference between the two centre positions,\n`LA = \u2211 n [win\u2202k\u03c6 i n|k=kc \u2212 wrn\u2202k(\u03c6rn + \u03d5)|k=kc ]. (15)\nBy analyzing the above derivation, we find that there two prerequisites for application of the linear approximation. (1) After scattering, the reflected beams should be still centred at kc in momentum space. (2) The reflection amplitude Ar(k) should be an analytic function in the neighbourhood of kc, as it is a prerequisite for the Taylor expansion of arg[Ar(k)].\nThese two conditions can be satisfied for most cases. Generally, condition (1) is always satisfied except that the reflection probability is vanishing at k = kc. But, in such case, the anomalous shift would be irrelevant for physical observations, as no particle is reflected back and then the anomalous shift will not happen. In contrast, we show that the condition (2) does not hold at certain incident angles and model parameters, beyond which the number of the scattered propagating states changes. This abrupt change generally leads to divergent shifts [obtained from linear approximation (15)] at the critical parameters, which apparently are not correct. Hence, to\nobtain correct results, we have to calculate the anomalous shifts via Eq. (6). We find that at the critical parameters, the anomalous shifts obtained from Eq. (6) are completely different from that obtained from linear approximation (15), and are not divergent. Away from the critical parameters, the anomalous shifts obtained from both approaches are almost the same. Besides, the anomalous shifts around (away from) the critical parameters have a strong (negligible) dependence on the beam width W . In the following, we use two representative examples to demonstrate our ideas."

            "text": "In the first case, we consider a graphene junction model. This model is simple and features a divergent longitudinal spatial shift with finite reflection probability [8]. However, the origin of the divergence has not been discussed. Here, we will show the divergence is caused by an abrupt change of scattering environment.\nAccording to the setup in Fig. 1, we assume the junction model is lied on the x-y plane. Notice that the zdirection here is a dummy degree of freedom, as graphene is a 2D system and the longitudinal shift is within the scattering plane. The Hamiltonian of the junction model is given as\nH =\n{ vkx\u03c3x + vky\u03c3y, x < 0,\nvkx\u03c3x + vky\u03c3y + V, x > 0, (16)\nwhere v is the fermi velocity, \u03c3 is the Pauli matrix and V denotes a potential energy applied on the x > 0 region.\nWe plot the band structure of the graphene model in both x < 0 and x > 0 regions in Fig. 2(a) and the corresponding equienergy contours in Fig. 2(b). The possible incident and reflected electron states are also marked in Fig. 2(a). One can find that for a fixed Fermi energy EF > 0 (measured from the Dirac point) and a finite V satisfying 0 < V < 2EF , there exists two critical incident angle \u00b1\u03b8c, beyond which there is no propagating mode for transmitted state [see Fig. 2(b)]. The critical angle is given as\n\u03b8c = arcsin \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223V \u2212 EFEF \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (17)\nWhen the incident angle \u03b8 = arctan(ky/kx) is smaller than the critical angle |\u03b8| < \u03b8c, an incident electron from x < 0 region can be reflected (transmitted) as a propagating state in x < 0 (x > 0) region. However, the number of transmitted propagating states varies from one to zero when |\u03b8| > \u03b8c, indicating an abrupt change of scattering environment. As discussed in Ref. [37], this change generally results in a discontinuity in the derivative of the reflection amplitude.

In the calculation, we choose EF = 100 meV, V = 150 meV and v = 10 6 m/s.\nthe critical incident angles \u00b1\u03b8c will be meaningless, making the anomalous spatial shifts obtained by linear approximation inaccurate.\nTo directly show this, we proceed to solve the scattering states of the graphene junction model (16), which can be written as\n\u03c8(k) =\n{ \u03c8i(k) +Ar\u03c8 r(k), x < 0,\nAt\u03c8 t(k), x > 0,\n(18)\nwhere Ar(t) is the reflection (transmission) amplitude, and \u03c8i, \u03c8r and \u03c8t are the basis state for incident, reflected and transmitted states, respectively. Explicitly, the basis states read\n\u03c8i(k) = 1\u221a 2\n( e\u2212i\u03b8/2\nei\u03b8/2\n) eikix+ikyy, (19)\n\u03c8r(k) = 1\u221a 2 ( \u2212iei\u03b8/2 ie\u2212i\u03b8/2 ) e\u2212ikix+ikyy, (20)\n\u03c8t(k) = 1\u221a\n2|EF \u2212 V |\n( EF \u2212 V\nv(kt + iky)\n) eiktx+ikyy.(21)\nHere ki = v \u22121 \u221a EF \u2212 v2k2y, \u03b8 = arctan (ky/ki) is the in-\ncident angle, kt = v \u22121sgn(EF \u2212 V ) \u221a (EF \u2212 V )2 \u2212 v2k2y for |\u03b8| < \u03b8c and kt = i\u03ba for |\u03b8| > \u03b8c, where \u03ba = v\u22121 \u221a v2k2y \u2212 (EF \u2212 V )2.

(b) `y vs \u03b8 for different beam width W . The box in (a) denotes the range of \u03b8 in (b). In the calculation, we choose EF = 100 meV, V = 150 meV, v = 10 6 m/s.\nwith which the reflection amplitude Ar is obtained as\nAr = v(\u03ba+ ky) + ie i\u03b8(EF \u2212 V ) vei\u03b8(i\u03ba+ iky) + (EF \u2212 V ) , (23)\nThe square of the module of Ar (|Ar|2) and the phase \u03d5 = arg(Ar) as functions of the incident angle are plotted in Fig. 2(c) and Fig. 2(d), respectively. One observes that for |\u03b8| < \u03b8c, Ar is a finite real number with \u03d5 = 0, and for |\u03b8| > \u03b8c, Ar becomes a complex number with |Ar|2 = 1, indicating the appearance of total reflection. This is consistent with the fact that when |\u03b8| > \u03b8c, there no longer exists a propagating mode for transmitted state. Importantly, while both |Ar|2 and \u03d5 are continuous functions, their derivative are discontinuous at the critical angle\u00b1\u03b8c [see Fig. 2(c) and (d)], corresponding to an abrupt change of the scattering condition, namely, the disappearance of the transmitted propagating mode for |\u03b8| > \u03b8c.\nBased on the expression of Ar, the longitudinal shift under linear approximation is obtained as\n`LAy = 2 sin2 \u03b8 + 1\u2212 V/EF\n\u03ba sin 2\u03b8 . (24)\nAs discussed above, the accuracy of the anomalous shift obtained from linear approximation requires Ar to be an analytic function. But Ar is not an analytic function in the neighbourhood of \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03b8c. Hence, Eq. (24) may be inaccurate around \u00b1\u03b8c. In Fig. 3(a), we plot the typical behavior of the longitudinal shift `LAy from Eq. (24), along with the shift `y obtained from Eq. (6) beyond linear approximation. We have checked that the wave packet of the reflected beam still features a Gaussiantype profile and is centred at same momentum with the incident wave packet. Hence, the shift obtained from Eq. (6) should be accurate. From Fig. 3(a), one observes that the `LAy has two discontinuity points at \u00b1\u03b8c. Specifically, it is zero for |\u03b8| < \u03b8c, diverges abruptly at \u00b1\u03b8c and becomes finite when moving away from \u00b1\u03b8c. In contrast, `y obtained from Eq. (6) is always continuous for any incident angle. Particularly, it is not divergent at \u00b1\u03b8c, indicating the non-physical divergent results from linear\n5 approximation is resolved by using Eq. (6) to calculate the anomalous shift. Besides, there are several other observations. (i) At critical angle \u00b1\u03b8c, while `y is not divergent, it still is very large and can reach few tens of nanometer with reasonable parameters. (ii) Away from \u00b1\u03b8c, `LAy and `y share similar behavior and are almost identical, as shown in Fig. 3(a).\nThe anomalous shifts (24) obtained from linear approximation are always independent of the beam width (\u223c W = |W |). However, in optics, it has been demonstrated that the anomalous shifts around the critical parameters strongly depend on the beam width [38\u201340]. Here, we also calculate the longitudinal shift `y from Eq. (6) for different W . The obtained results are shown in Fig. 3(b), from which one can find that the maximum value of `y indeed varies with Wy, consistent with the results in optics. Again, when moving away from \u00b1\u03b8c, `y is not sensitive to the value of W ."

The corresponding BdG equation can be written as\nH(x)\u03c8 = \u03b5\u03c8, (25)\nwith \u03b5 the excitation energy\nH =\n[ \u2212 12m\u2207\n2 \u2212 EF 0 0 \u2212T (\u2212 12m\u2207 2)T \u22121 + EF\n] , (26)\nfor normal metal region (x < 0), and\nH =\n[ H0 + V \u2212 EF \u2206(k\u2016)\n\u2206\u2217(k\u2016) \u2212T H0T \u22121 \u2212 V + EF\n] , (27)\nfor the superconductor region (x > 0). Besides, the interface barrier potential h\u03b4(x) is considered. Here, m denotes the electron mass, EF is the Fermi energy, T is the time reversal operator, H0 = \u2212 12m ( \u22022z + \u2202 2 y ) \u2212 12mx \u2202 2 x, \u2206(ky, kz) = \u22060 cos(2\u03c6k) represents a dy2\u2212z2 pairing with \u03c6k = arctan(ky/kz), and V is a potential energy ensuring EF \u2212 V \u22060. According to the setup in Fig. 1, the rotation angle is identical to \u03c6k, namely, \u03b1 = \u03c6k.\nThis model has been used to show that transverse shift can be solely induced by the unconventional pairing, and it is found that by varying rotation angle \u03b1 [see Fig. 1(b)], the transverse shift becomes divergent at certain critical angles. Here, we will show that the divergence is also caused by the change in the number of transmitted propagating states at the critical angles.\nE \u03b5\n\u03c6k=0\n(a)\n\u03b5\n\u03c6k= \u03c0 4\nE\n(b)\nThe scattering states of Eq. (25) can be written as [33]\n\u03c8(k) =\n{ \u03c8i(k) + re\u03c8 r e(k) + rh\u03c8 r h(k), x < 0,\nt1\u03c8 t 1(k) + t2\u03c8 t 2(k), x > 0,\n(28)\nwhere re(h) is the amplitude for the normal (Andreev) reflection, and t1(2) is the transmission amplitude, and the \u03c8 are the corresponding basis states, expressed as\n\u03c8re(k) = ( 1 0 ) e\u2212ik e xx+ikyy+ikzz, (29)\n\u03c8rh(k) = ( 0 1 ) eik h xx+ikyy+ikzz, (30)\n\u03c8t\u00b1(k) = ( 1 \u03b7\u00b1 ) eik \u00b1 S x+ikyy+ikzz, (31)\nwhere \u03b7\u00b1 = \u2206k\u00b1 \u03b5\u00b1 \u221a \u03b52\u2212\u22062\nk \u00b1 S\nwith \u2206k\u00b1 = \u2206 ( kS\u00b1, ky, kz ) ,\nk\u2016 = \u221a k2y + k 2 z , k e/h x = \u221a 2mEF \u2212 k2\u2016, and k \u00b1 S =\n\u00b1 \u221a\n2mx(Ef \u2212 U \u2212 k2\u2016/2m). Before processing to the concrete calculations of the scattering amplitudes and the anomalous shifts, we discuss the influences of rotation angle and the value of excitation energy on the scattering in the interface. Since the d-wave superconductor is anisotropic in ky-kz plane, the band structure of the superconductor in different incident planes (determined by the rotation angle \u03b1) will be different, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), indicating the transverse shift is sensitive to the rotation angle \u03b1 and \u03c6k. We also plot the band gap Egap = |\u2206k| of the superconductor\n6 (a) (b)\n\u03c6k /\u03c0\n\u03b5 > \u22060\n\u2202\u03c6 \u03c6 h\u03c6 h\n\u03c6k /\u03c0\n\u2202\u03c6 \u03c6 h\u03c6 h\n\u03b5 < \u22060\n(c) (d)\nas a function of \u03c6k in Fig. 4(c), showing the superconductor becomes gapless at \u03c6k = \u00b1\u03c0/4, \u00b13\u03c0/4. Then, a key observation is that for any excitation energy satisfying |\u03b5| < \u22060, the two transmitted states (\u03c8t1 and \u03c8t2) are propagating modes for | cos 2\u03c6| < \u03b5/\u22060 (|\u03b5| > Egap) and are evanescent modes for | cos 2\u03c6| > \u03b5/\u22060 (|\u03b5| < Egap), as illustrated in Fig. 4(c). In contrast, the two transmitted states are always propagating modes when |\u03b5| > \u22060, as |\u03b5| > Egap for any \u03c6k [see Fig. 4(d)]. Similarly, one can expect that the critical rotation angles for divergent transverse shifts in Ref. [33]. satisfy | cos 2\u03c6c| = \u03b5/\u22060 with |\u03b5| < \u22060. Besides, when |\u03b5| > \u22060, the transverse shifts obtained from linear approximation will be accurate and consistent with that obtained from Eq. (6).\nWith the boundary conditions,\n\u03c8(x = 0\u2212) = \u03c8(x = 0+), (32)\n1 m \u2202x\u03c8(x = 0 \u2212) = 1 mx \u2202x\u03c8(x = 0 +)\u2212 h\u03c8(0), (33)\nthe Andreev reflection amplitude rh is obtained as\nrh = \u22124\u03b7\u2212\u03b7+\u0393\n\u03b7+ (Z \u2212 2\u0393)\u2212 \u03b7\u2212 (Z + 2\u0393) , (34)\nwith Z = 4mhke 2 + 1 + \u03932 and \u0393 = mk+s m1ke .\nIn Fig. 5, we plot the obtained |rh|2 and \u03d5h = arg(rh) as functions of the rotation angle \u03c6k for |\u03b5| < \u22060 and |\u03b5| > \u22060. We find that the derivative of |rh|2 and \u03d5h = arg(rh) exhibit eight discontinuity points at \u03c6c = \u00b1[arccos(\u03b5/\u22060)]/2 when |\u03b5| < \u22060, but are smooth functions when |\u03b5| > \u22060, consistent with the analysis of the band structure of the junction model. Interestingly, rh is a pure real number when |\u03b5| > \u22060. We then study the dependence of anomalous transverse shift on the rotation angle and \u03c6k.\n(a) (b)\nUnder the linear approximation, the anomalous transverse shift in Andreev reflection is established as\n`LAT = \u2212 1\nk\u2016 \u2202\u03c6k\u03d5h\n= \u2212 \u03c1\u039b\u2206 2 0 sin(4\u03c6k)\nk\u2016\u03b52 (1 + \u039b2/\u03c12) \u0398 (|\u22060 cos 2\u03c6k| \u2212 \u03b5) (35)\nwith \u03c1 = \u03b5/ \u221a\n\u220620 cos 2(2\u03c6k)\u2212 \u03b52 and \u039b = Z/(2\u0393). Ac-\ncording to Eq. (35), we find the transverse shift obtained from linear approximation `LAT indeed is divergent at \u03c6c when |\u03b5| < \u22060, as shown Fig. 6. For \u03b5 > \u22060, the transverse shift will be zero, as rh is a real number with \u03d5h = 0.\nThe numerical results of the transverse shifts `T obtained from Eq. (6) with |\u03b5| < \u22060 and different beam width also are plotted in Fig. 6. We have checked that the wave packets of the reflected hole beam still can be well defined and exhibit a Gaussian-type profile, indicating the calculated anomalous shift would be reliable. One observes that for all the beam widths, the transverse shifts are not divergent at the critical angles \u03c6c. Similar to the first case, we find that (i) the anomalous shift indeed is significant at the critical angles and can reach few tens of nanometer with reasonable parameters, (ii) `T and ` LA T are almost identical away from the critical angle \u03c6c and (iii) the anomalous shift is sensitive to the beam width when and only when \u03c6k is close to \u03b1c. Besides, when |\u03b5|/\u22060 > 1, the transverse shifts `T obtained from Eq. (6) is negligible, consistent with the results from linear approximation."

            "text": "In this work, we study the anomalous shift in interface electronic reflection based on the quantum scattered approach with and without linear approximation. We find that for a large case of junction models, the propagating modes of scattering states may be changed by varying certain parameters like incident angle. Around the\n7 critical parameters, the linear approximation is invalid and leads to divergent anomalous shifts in scattering. In contrast, the quantum scattered approach without linear approximation always gives accurate results, which are significant but not divergent around the critical parameters. Moreover, we show the anomalous shifts around the critical parameters decrease when increasing the width of the incident beam. This means that the narrower the incident beam, the more pronounced the anomalous shift. Away from the critical parameters, the anomalous shifts obtained from the quantum scattered approach with and without linear approximation are similar and not sensitive to the beam width."
