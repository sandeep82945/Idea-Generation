    "abstractText": "Due to the advances in digital technology, the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concept has been transformed into the digital environmental, social, and corporate governance (DESG) model, which can be realized as a potentially vital strategic movement for sustainable business practices in the contemporary digital era. Nevertheless, there is a lack of empirical research evidence on how firms\u2019 DESG practices impact customers\u2019 attitudes and brand equity. The purposes of this study were (1) to investigate the effect of DESG initiatives on customers\u2019 attitudes (CA) and brand equity (BE), and (2) to explore how those impacts vary based on the diversity of socioeconomic attributes. An online survey was conducted, and the data were analyzed by a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Based on 212 samples of Thai citizens\u2019 experiences with firms\u2019 DESG initiatives, the results revealed that DESG has a significant positive direct effect on CA. The mediation analysis revealed that CA fully mediated the relationship between DESG and BE. The results of a second-order confirmatory factor analysis of the DESG construct found that the digital social dimension (b = 0.775) played the strongest role in explaining DESG, followed by the digital environmental (b = 0.768) and digital governance (b = 0.718) dimensions. The moderation analysis found that the impact of DESG on CA was stronger for younger groups than older populations. Additionally, the group with a higher formal education level seemed to exhibit higher levels of CA than those with a lower level. Our study is one of a few endeavors to clarify the effects of DESG from the customer\u2019s side, and suggests several implications and recommendations.",

            "text": "The environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concept has gained prominence as a crucial term in business management strategies around the world. ESG stands for \u201cenvironmental, social, and governance\u201d, and refers to the non-financial issues that a company should examine in addition to the financial reasons when making investment decisions [1]. Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic can help businesses alter their focus to become more resilient to catastrophes. Visionary organizations are establishing a compass to better respond to future crises and navigate through volatility by focusing on responses to social and environmental concerns rather than the standard company operational outlook [2]. Companies have been required to reduce their environmental impact, increase their worker value, diversify their relationships, and keep their businesses profitable during the last few decades as a result of pressure from stakeholders. Investors must strike an equilibrium between an asset\u2019s risk and return before deciding. Hedge and mutual funds with environmental, social, and governance initiatives currently handle more than USD 30 trillion. The ESG concept is used to track half of the European investment market and around one-third of the American market [3]. Consumers are becoming more conscious of the effects when choosing ESG-focused companies, whereas businesses are\nSustainability 2022, 14, 10480. https://doi.org/10.3390/su141710480 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nboosting public awareness of their efforts. E-commerce participants are also emphasizing their efforts to lessen the environmental impact of shipping materials as well as the carbon costs of moving products directly to customers. The burden is also being felt by companies in their supply chain. More often, customers are gradually selecting brands that are devoted to environmental sustainability, according to a prior survey. The study found that 80% of consumers said they are more likely to choose a brand which is environmentally sustainable. This illustrates a change in customers\u2019 perceptions of businesses\u2019 environmental strategies; for example, 90% of customers believe that society needs to become more energy-conscious [4]. In Thailand, various businesses in the banking, financial market, and insurance industries have attempted to apply ESG practices. The Ministry of Finance, for example, is developing a Sustainable Financing Framework with the goal of issuing sovereign green, social, and sustainable bonds and loans. One of the primary objectives of the Bank of Thailand\u2019s three-year strategy plan (2020\u20132022) is to encourage financial institutions to integrate ESG into their business and operating models. Sustainability disclosures have been promoted among listed firms of all sizes by the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), accompanied by the establishment of the Thailand Sustainability Investment (THSI) and SETTHSI indexes, which include listed companies who pass the THSI assessment standards [2]. Although metrics and standards for reporting on environmental, social, and governance issues have been developed to share information with stakeholders, they are frequently directed at regulators and investors rather than consumers; thus, customers\u2019 perceptions of sustainability activities are not necessarily reflected in communications about such activities. The contemporary developments in digital technologies enable firms to implement and communicate their environmental, social, and good governance practices through digital platforms. For example, people can immerse themselves in the new virtual environment known as the Metaverse. The Metaverse is a virtual world where people can exist as digital characters (avatars) who can roam in three dimensions and participate in events, exercise, shop, gamble, and even play games. In the Metaverse, business owners can set up online stores, employ shopkeepers, and offer goods and services to avatars who are virtual humans. Regardless of their physical locations, businesses and organizations can organize meetings in the Metaverse [5]. Less travel is anticipated when meetings and social events take place in the Metaverse, which will cut down on the carbon emissions produced by physical commutes using various modes of transportation. Around 20% of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions are attributable to transportation, with road travel accounting for 75% of these emissions [6]. Hopefully, the environmental advantages of the Metaverse development will outweigh the disadvantages. We have coined the term \u201cDigital Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (DESG)\u201d to describe the phenomenon, which refers to organizational activities that aim to promote sustainable development goals through the innovative application of technologies that produce, utilize, transmit, or source electronic data. In reality, little research has been carried out on how DESG measurements and reporting affect customers\u2019 attitudes and behaviors towards sustainability [7]. Nevertheless, in the contemporary setting of the digitalized corporate environment, businesses work to implement digital initiatives and declare their intentions towards the environment, society, and governance in relation to these multifaceted digitalization agendas in their strategic planning. To adapt to the ongoing changes brought about by digitization and fulfill their commitments to a variety of stakeholders, businesses must proactively consider these developments [8]. In this sense, a company makes use of digital technology to address multiple stakeholders and prioritizes DESG in its strategic planning. Little research has looked at how DESG affects brand equity and consumer sentiments. To fulfill this research gap, the current research proposed and verified the effect of firms\u2019 DESG initiatives from the customers\u2019 side. This study explored the impact of DESG initiatives on customers\u2019 attitudes and brand equity and how those impacts vary based on the diversity of customers\u2019 profiles.\nThis study is organized as follows. An overview of the literature on the DESG concept and its ramifications is presented in Section 2. The study framework is explained, and the hypotheses are developed in Section 3. The methodology that was used to acquire the data is illustrated in Section 4. The results of the data analysis are shown and discussed in Section 5. The conclusions are presented in Section 6, along with this study\u2019s limitations and potential guidelines for further research."

            "heading": "2.1. From ESG to DESG",
            "text": "Since its introduction in 2006 with the release of the UN Principles of Responsible Investment, the ESG concept has captured the attention of researchers and practitioners. The three new pillars of corporate social responsibility are also known as the ESG concept. Its definitions include terms such as \u201cgreen\u201d, \u201cethical\u201d, \u201cmission\u201d, \u201cimpact\u201d, \u201cresponsible\u201d, \u201cvalues\u201d, \u201csocially responsible\u201d, and \u201csustainability\u201d, which refer to methods of having a good social influence [1]. To direct, administer, and manage all of its affairs in a way that furthers the interests of its stockholders and other stakeholders, an organization\u2019s relationship with its ecological surroundings, its coexistence and interaction with people and other populations, and its corporate system of internal controls and procedures are all considered to be part of ESG [9,10]. The term \u201cdigital transformation\u201d refers to the application of a wide range of technologies from the digital, physical, and biological areas, either singly or in combination, to create new markets and enterprises, as well as possibly addressing ESG and other social and economic issues. Both digital and ESG activities seek to fulfill shifting stakeholder expectations as well as the effects of new business and operating models on society and the environment. The adoption of digital technologies and their capacity to influence ESG goals are becoming increasingly convergent. Improved data collection, reporting, and analysis will have the largest immediate impact and will benefit every part of the business. Additionally, organizations in the banking and treasury sectors are implementing cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain to digitize their supply chains, as well as cloud infrastructure, robotics for shared service center operations, and artificial intelligence (AI). They are also applying new information and cooperation mechanisms to achieve important objectives such as regulatory compliance, data protection, workforce productivity, etc. Many corporations are discovering that this novel technology advances genuine compliance with ESG goals, because contemporary digital technologies can transform function quickly. They can complement one another rather than clash with one another, assisting firms in achieving critically essential priorities that are growing more and more important to both employees and constituents, as well as customers [11]. For instance, by utilizing machine learning in conjunction with optical sensors, artificial intelligence (AI) enables a business to identify and lower the amount of methane emissions at a wellhead or pipeline more effectively. One of the top AI businesses is Royal Dutch Shell, which has integrated descriptive analytics and preventative maintenance for 500,000 valves throughout its global operations. The ability of AI to perform data analysis and the methods that enable computers to do so identify important information that can be used as a basis for business choices. The ability to track CO2 removal and energy emission reduction makes AI a useful addition to ESG programs. Additionally, Shell has begun integrating digital twin technology into its gas facilities to investigate operational performance, reduce energy use, and ultimately boost gas and condensate production. By identifying cost-saving options in specific parts of a process or service that might otherwise be viewed as wasteful, this cutting-edge technology helps DESG [12]. Nowadays, customers are more empowered thanks to social media, digital tools, and widespread information access. Customers are embracing technology to hold businesses accountable to them and to make use of their consumer rights. Private data and information can be generated, stored, and exchanged almost indefinitely due to digital and internet technology. To maintain their digital experience, businesses must foster collaboration and streamline decision-making. Firms require a structure and plan for digital governance\nwhich promotes workflows that are faster, easier, and more efficient. The goal of the discipline of \u201cdigital governance\u201d is to clearly define who is responsible for digital strategy, policy, and standards [13]. The norms, institutions, and standards that influence the laws governing the creation and application of these technologies are collectively referred to as digital governance [14]. An organization can use data and digital technologies in ways that are regarded as socially responsible by following a set of practices and behaviors that together make up a digital social pillar. In other words, the digital social pillar deals with how a company uses technology to foster positive relationships with individuals, groups, and society [15]. The performance of a company is influenced by its brand identity, customer and stakeholder communication strategies, recruiting policies, and any other people-centric activities carried out through or influenced by digital platforms. Tools that respect client privacy are available for use by businesses. For instance, iOS\u2019s App Tracking Transparency feature lets users choose which apps can share data. Businesses should prevent misinformation on all platforms and channels where they engage with customers. They can do this by checking the facts of everything they say on every platform, responding quickly and honestly to criticism online, and supporting laws that control content [16]. Previous research has investigated the relationship between ESG and financial issues such as the cost of capital and firms\u2019 financial performance. Access to external financial resources is more likely for transparent organizations that embrace broader ESG disclosure practices [17]. The cost of loans can be reduced because lenders are better informed about the many business variables associated with increased company transparency on ESG issues. Companies can now provide information about all facets of business management without hiding anything that potential lenders might find important by providing more information on environmental impacts, social issues, and corporate governance systems [18]. The cost of debt for borrowing firms is shown to be correlated with their ESG rating [19]. As a result of their exposure to environmental, social, and governance liabilities that eventually raise their default risk, firms with low ESG ratings are thought to be riskier. Ramirez, Monsalve, Gonz\u00e1lez-Ruiz, Almonacid, and Pe\u00f1a found that the governance pillar score shows a negative relationship with the cost of capital [20]. This demonstrates that making internal processes and governance bodies clearer can be a key driver of creating value for firms and giving investors more confidence. Good ESG performance can enhance financial performance [21]. This finding has important ramifications for investors, firm management, decision-makers, and industry regulators. To accomplish a long-term profitability goal, the emphasis must be shifted from profit maximization to corporate social responsibility. This will support the company\u2019s long-term sustainable and healthy development while also enhancing its societal impact and public image. About 90% of 2000 empirical studies revealed a non-negative association between ESG and business financial performance [22]. More significantly, the vast majority of studies present positive results. DESG is more than just ESG with a \u201cdigital\u201d label attached. DESG blends ethical digital transformation concepts with responsible and more sustainable business practices, although both have a similar overall framework. The ultimate outcome is a modern organizational framework for the 21st century. For this reason, the digital environmental, social, and corporate governance (DESG) concept should be emphasized by firms as an imperative strategic movement to establish enterprises that only take what they need to maintain the sustainability of social, environmental, and economic systems. The term \u201cdigital environmental, social, and corporate governance\u201d is used by the authors to refer to firms\u2019 initiatives that aim to promote Sustainable Development Goals through the innovative application of technologies that produce, utilize, transmit, or source electronic data. These activities\u2019 digital nature frees them from geographical restrictions and increases scalability, which increases their impact. These DESG activities\u2019 goals also remove the tension between profit and purpose by emphasizing the creation of socio-ecological value as a crucial component of an economic offer. This is what makes the DESG lens different from other lenses."

            "heading": "2.2. Customer Attitudes and Brand Equity",
            "text": "The customer\u2019s attitude is defined as the willingness of the customer to express a favorable or unfavorable reaction toward specific goods, businesses, or brands. An individual\u2019s perception of any brand is based on the information or knowledge they have learned from their family, friends, networks, cultural background, and other external factors. Alternatively, these sentiments can be based on customers\u2019 experiences and engagement. Customers gradually develop their attitudes regarding a brand, deciding whether they like, trust, or are loyal to it [23]. In our study, \u201ccustomer attitude\u201d refers to consumers\u2019 perceptions of businesses or brands that follow ethical business practices and are socially and ecologically responsible. Customers could have a favorable opinion of brands or corporations based on companies\u2019 DESG initiatives. According to Aaker (1996), brand equity is the combination of brand assets and liabilities associated with a brand\u2019s name and symbol that add to or detract from the value supplied by a product or service to a business and/or that business\u2019s customers [24]. The company\u2019s perspective was included by Keller, Parameswaran, and Jacob (2011), who defined it as the diverse impacts of brand understanding on customers\u2019 responses to brand marketing [25]. Brand equity is a collection of beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, and actions on the part of a consumer that result in improved utility and allow a brand to generate greater margins than it could without the brand [26]. Although several studies have investigated the consequences of ESG, to date, no study has examined the effect of DESG on customers\u2019 attitudes and brand equity. Corporate social responsibility should enhance consumers\u2019 perceptions of a company, according to widely accepted marketing studies [27]. Companies with effective ESG policies make use of factors that give them a competitive advantage, such as improved brand trust and image [1]."

            "text": "This study explored the effect of DESG initiatives on customers\u2019 attitudes and brand equity. DESG is a second-order construct which comprises three dimensions, namely, the digital environmental, social, and governance pillars. Kwak and Cha (2022) argued that firms\u2019 ESG activities affect customers\u2019 attitudes such as brand image [5]. Four out of five consumers say that they are inclined to purchase from a consumer brand that takes a pro-sustainability stance, according to the Sustainability Matters consumer research survey [4]. A company can gain a competitive edge through brands with a strong social presence. Social responsibility initiatives thus play a significant role in building a company\u2019s reputation. Historical studies have shown how important ethical and responsible business practices are in fostering brand preferences and subsequently enhancing equity [28,29]. According to Jones [30], consumers\u2019 attitudes toward brand equity are the result of co-creative interactions between customers and brands [30]. Customers\u2019 positive perceptions of a company\u2019s social responsibility efforts help to build brand equity. From a strategic standpoint, social responsibility actions can help develop and preserve a brand\u2019s reputation, and can therefore be viewed as an investment from a strategic standpoint. Social responsibility programs benefit brand equity and a company\u2019s reputation in a positive catalytic way [31]. Regarding socio-economic attributes, Smith et al. found that women pay greater attention to corporate ethical obligations than men [32]. Haski-Leventhal et al. also found that positive attitudes toward CSR initiatives vary according to age [33]. Based on the literature review, we proposed the conceptual framework as shown in Figure 1.\nH1: DESG significantly influences customers\u2019 attitudes (CA).\nH2: Customers\u2019 attitudes (CA) significantly influence brand equity (BE).\nH3: Customers\u2019 attitudes (CA) positively mediate the relationships between DESG and brand eq-\nuity (BE).\nH4: Socio-economic attributes (gender, age, education level, and income) moderate the effect of\nDESG on customers\u2019 attitudes (CA)."

            "text": "There were two sections in the questionnaire. Information on demographics and behavior was covered in the first part. Measurement items based on perceptions of DESG projects were included in the second segment. In this study, DESG consisted of three dimensions: the digital environmental, digital social, and digital governance pillars. The authors adopted and modified the questionnaire items from previous studies [36\u201345]. To evaluate the customers\u2019 attitudes, the researchers considered a four-item scale from Herrero and Mart\u00ednez (2020), and Chu and Chen (2019) [46,47]. Brand equity was evaluated using a four-item scale adopted and modified from the study of Christodoulides and Chernatony (2010) [26]. Responses were rated on a Likert scale of 1 to 5, with 5 representing \u201cstrongly agree or always\u201d and 1 representing \u201cstrongly disagree or never\u201d. Each construct in the questionnaire, which consisted of 20 measurement items, is listed in Table 1. For determining the validity of the questions, a director from the Creative Economy Agency (CEA), a senior lecturer from Bangkok University, and one expert from the Digital Economy Promotion Agency (DEPA) were invited to review the relevance and validity of the questions, including any potential ambiguities, to ensure that the goals and objectives of the present study were clear. The researcher invited the experts to use the Index of Item Objective Congruence (IOC) to examine the consistency between the research objectives and the survey items [48]. The range of the IOC values determined by the experts\u2019 judgment was 0.80 to 1.00, which met the required level. The next step involved 30 undergraduate students at Bangkok University participating in a pilot test study. The internal consistency reliability was shown to be quite high, with a scale-wide Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient ranging between 0.906 and 0.954 for the pilot test."

The first approach was evaluating the measurement model through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Both convergent and discriminant validities were tested to ensure that our measurement constructs adequately explained the proposed conceptual framework. As illustrated earlier, the ESG is a higher-order construct with three dimensions, namely, the DEP (four items), DSP (four items), and DGP (four items) constructs. CA and BE were measured by four items each. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was found to be between 0.848 and 0.904. The results of the measurement model are summarized in Tables 3 and 4.\nNotes: DEP1, DSP1, DGP1, CA1, and BE1 are fixed parameters; ESG is a second-order construct of DEP, DSP, and DGP; *** p < 0.001.

Non-diagonal elements denote the correlations between the constructs. Only correlations and the AVE square root of the first-order constructs are shown in the table.\nTable 3 demonstrates that, when the six constructs are analyzed, the model fit is good (Chi-square = 383.284; df = 164; CMIN/df = 2.337; GFI = 0.911; NFI = 0.958; TLI = 0.985; CFI = 0.941; RMSEA = 0.039). Item loading (standardized estimates), average variance extracted (AVE), and composite reliability (CR) are all measures of convergent validity. Hair et al. (2014) [50] stated that these metrics should have an AVE of >0.5 and a CR of >0.7. This shows that the convergent validity is acceptable. The results of the discriminant validity test are given in Table 4. The square root of each construct\u2019s AVE was larger than the estimates of their inter-construct correlations; therefore, the study had satisfactory discriminant validity."

Critical ratios were developed in the study to evaluate the moderation hypothesis. The ratios were established for variance in the factor loadings between groups of socio-\neconomic attributes using AMOS, a statistical package provided by Gaskin and Lim (2018) for evaluating moderation effects by means of regression weights and critical ratios for different parameters [52]. The authors explored the related models for each binary group separately and compared the regression weights and critical ratios for differences among the groups (see Table 7).\nTable 7 shows that DESG had a significant and positive effect on CA for both male (\u03b2 = 0.515, p < 0.001) and female (\u03b2 = 0.541, p < 0.001) participants. Nevertheless, the authors found no statistically significant difference between males and females (Z score = 1.472).

The outcomes show a stronger impact of DESG on CA in the younger group compared with the older group (Z-score = 4.587 ***). For education, DESG significantly and positively impacted CA among groups with an educational level below a bachelor\u2019s degree (\u03b2 = 0.318, p < 0.001) and those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher (\u03b2 = 0.567, p < 0.001). The outcomes revealed the strong impact of DESG on CA for the group with a higher education level compared with those with lower education (Z-score = 4.789 ***). Regarding income, the authors observed a non-statistically significant difference between high- and low-income groups (Z score = 1.311).

            "text": "The purposes of this study were to examine the impact of DESG on customers\u2019 attitude and brand equity, and to examine how the impact of DESG on customers\u2019 attitudes varied in accordance with the differences in demographic factors such as gender, age, education, and income. The outcomes revealed that DESG has both a direct positive effect on customers\u2019 attitudes and an indirect positive effect on brand equity via customers\u2019 attitudes. Our findings are consistent with those of a previous study by Koh et al. (2022), showing that perceived DESG had direct positive effects on consumers\u2019 perceptions such as brand trustworthiness, brand image, and perceived quality [1]. Although the findings of our study did not show a direct effect of DESG on brand equity, the mediation analysis confirmed that customers\u2019 attitudes positively mediated the relationship between DESG and brand equity. In other words, DESG initiatives can strengthen customers\u2019 positive attitudes towards firms or brands, which subsequently lead to higher levels of brand equity. Regarding the three dimensions of DESG, the digital social dimension played the strongest role in explaining DESG, followed by the digital environmental and digital governance dimensions. Due to their failure to inform the public of their DESG efforts, many organizations with DESG initiatives have lowered their corporate image. It is crucial to communicate firms\u2019 DESG efforts, although various demographics respond to ESG programs in different ways [53]. Our research provides useful information regarding which components of DESG firms should prioritize when communicating with the public. Prior to developing an ESG communication strategy, businesses must comprehend the relative importance of each\ncomponent to various demographics. Finding out how much different demographic groups care about firms\u2019 digital environmental, social, and governance initiatives also provides marketers with very useful information to effectively undertake their DESG communications. According to the empirical data of this study, the findings are inconsistent with those of a previous study [33,54], which found a correlation between gender and perceptions of what the ethical climate should be, with females showing significantly more favorable attitudes toward ethical behavior than males. We found that there was no statistically significant difference between men and women when it came to the DESG efforts of firms. The results of the moderation analysis confirmed that the well-educated younger generation seemed to be more concerned about firms\u2019 DESG efforts. This finding differs from that of a prior study by Haski-Leventhal et al., which indicated that older age groups rated transcendent ideals and favorable social responsibility attitudes more highly than younger age groups [33]; however, our findings are in line with those of Kim et al., who showed that the younger generation acknowledged the importance of ESG initiatives when selecting e-commerce service providers [55]. About 33% of millennials use investments that include ESG aspects frequently or solely, according to the Harris Poll conducted for CNBC, compared with 19% of Gen Z, 16% of Gen X, and 2% of Baby Boomers [56]. Interestingly, groups with a higher formal education level seem to possess a more positive attitude towards firms\u2019 DESG initiatives than those with a lower educational level. This finding is consistent with Karaba\u0161evic\u0301 et al., who showed that the level of awareness and comprehension of principles of overall sustainability and their implementation in the country\u2019s territory increases with education level [57]. The results of this study have numerous managerial implications. Initially, firms should focus more on DESG as one of the vital strategies to drive positive customer attitudes and to strengthen their brand equity. The results of the study show that customers\u2019 attitudes positively increase when customers perceive firms\u2019 DESG initiatives, subsequently leading to enhanced brand equity. Secondly, firms need to take the different impacts of digital environment, social, and governance initiatives into account. Our findings confirmed that the environment, social, and governance concepts have an unequal effect on customers\u2019 attitudes. Thirdly, the findings of this study provide specific guidelines for firms to help them use different DESG communication strategies depending on the socio-economic groups of their customers. The results of this research revealed that the importance of a firm\u2019s DESG activities increases with the customers\u2019 formal education level. As a result, it is crucial to promote DESG initiatives through communication channels primarily used by customers with high levels of education. Moreover, the results suggested that the impact of DESG on customer\u2019s attitude was stronger for younger groups than older ones. Therefore, firms should consider whether the DESG initiatives are correctly matched with the targeted customer groups when promoting DESG initiatives."

            "text": "The aims of this study were to explore the impact of DESG on customers\u2019 attitudes and brand equity, and the moderating effect of the socio-economic characteristics of the customers such as gender, age, formal education level, and income. The results revealed that perceived DESG was found to be a significant determinant of CA. The results of the mediation analysis also revealed that consumers\u2019 attitudes fully mediate the effect of DESG on BE. Socio-economic factors influence not only the customers\u2019 choice of a firm\u2019s product or brand, but also the customers\u2019 attitudes towards firms\u2019 DESG initiatives. Two socioeconomic attributes (age and formal education) were found to moderate the effect of DESG on CA. To enact DESG, businesses must be concerned about how their own activities might cause such consequences, in addition to being aware of the different potential implications of digital technology on customers, stakeholders, the environment, and society. Therefore, DESG culture must ensure that firms which use technology are held responsible for any negative effects that come from their work on developing, using, evaluating, and improving the technology. People must be given the freedom to apply these concepts to their daily\ntasks if DESG principles are to be implemented throughout the entire organization. In summary, DESG is a new yet developing field. It is time to integrate these ideas into common corporate terminology. There are a few limitations present in the study which must be discussed. Firstly, this study comprised only a few constructs that we expected to be impacted by DESG. Future research could include more constructs such as eWOM and purchase intentions, and test these with empirical data. Additionally, increased ESG action is linked to higher costs and cash flows from those initiatives. Financial considerations including the cost of equity, the cost of capital, and cash flow should be considered in further analyses of the value of DESG activities. Secondly, the samples were collected in Thailand. The generalization of the outcomes should be carried out prudently. Dissimilar cultural characteristics may affect customers\u2019 attitudes towards DESG. The collection and comparison of data across countries is a potential area for future research.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, W.P. and S.T.; Data curation, W.P. and S.T.; Formal analysis, W.P. and S.T.; Funding acquisition, W.P.; Investigation, W.P. and S.T.; Methodology, W.P. and S.T.; Project administration, S.T.; Resources, W.P.; Validation, W.P. and S.T.; Visualization, S.T.; Writing\u2014original draft, W.P. and S.T.; Writing\u2014review & editing, S.T.
