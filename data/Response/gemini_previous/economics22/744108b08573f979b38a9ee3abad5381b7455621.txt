1. **Investigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on reading achievement.** 
This could be done by following the same cohort of students over time to see how their reading skills develop in the years after the pandemic. This information could be used to inform educational policy and practice and to identify students who need additional support.


2. **Examine the impact of different types of instructional interventions on reading achievement during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.** 
This could include interventions such as summer school, tutoring, and online learning. This information could be used to develop more effective interventions to help students catch up on the reading skills they lost during the pandemic.


3. **Explore the role of families and communities in supporting reading achievement during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.** 
This could include examining how families and communities can help students access educational resources, provide emotional support, and create a positive learning environment. This information could be used to develop programs and policies that help families and communities support students' reading achievement.


4. **Investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reading achievement gap between different groups of students.** 
This could include examining how the pandemic affected the reading achievement gap between students from different racial/ethnic groups, socioeconomic backgrounds, and disability status. This information could be used to develop policies and programs to address the reading achievement gap.


5. **Develop and evaluate new assessment tools to measure reading achievement during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.** 
This could include developing assessments that are more sensitive to changes in reading skills over time and that can be administered remotely. This information could be used to improve the accuracy and timeliness of feedback to students and teachers and to identify students who need additional support.
