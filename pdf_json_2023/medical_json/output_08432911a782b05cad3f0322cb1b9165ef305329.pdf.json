            "text": "2 / 18\nStacking bilayer structures is an efficient way to tune the topology of\npolaritons in in-plane anisotropic films, e.g., by leveraging the twist angle (TA). However, the effect of another geometric parameter, film thickness ratio (TR), on manipulating the plasmon topology in bilayers is elusive. Here, we fabricate bilayer structures of WTe2 films, which naturally host in-plane hyperbolic plasmons in the terahertz range. Plasmon topology is successfully modified by changing the TR and TA synergistically, manifested by the extinction spectra of unpatterned films and the polarization dependence of the plasmon intensity measured in skew ribbon arrays. Such TR- and TA-tunable topological transitions can be well explained based on the effective sheet optical conductivity by adding up those of the two films. Our study demonstrates TR as another degree of freedom for the manipulation of plasmonic topology in nanophotonics, exhibiting promising applications in bio-sensing, heat transfer and the enhancement of spontaneous emission.\nKeywords: plasmonics, hyperbolic polaritons, two-dimensional materials, photonic\ntopological transition\nTOC Figure:\n3 / 18\nPlasmon polaritons, the coupled modes of free carrier collective oscillations and\nelectromagnetic waves, can induce subwavelength light confinement and significantly boost light-matter interactions for numerous applications1, 2. In two-dimensional (2D) films with thickness much smaller than the plasmon wavelength, the topology of the 2D plasmon is determined by the signs of the sheet optical conductivities along two inplane principal axes, giving rise to elliptic (hyperbolic) iso-frequency contours (IFCs) in the same (opposite) sign configuration3-6. Especially in the hyperbolic regime, plasmons have open IFCs, extremely large wavevectors, directional propagation and high optical local density of states, exhibiting great potential for nano-confinement of light7, 8, polarization engineering9, 10, enhancement of light-matter interactions11, 12 and near-field radiative heat transfer13-16.\nThe change between such two different plasmonic iso-frequency topologies (i.e.,\nbetween the elliptic and hyperbolic regimes) is known as photonic topological transition17, in a close analog to Lifshitz transition in condensed matter physics where the Fermi surface undergoes an evolution from open to closed contours18. Tailoring the plasmonic topology between the elliptic and the hyperbolic regimes is crucial for the steering of plasmon propagation6 and light-matter interactions19. The strong light confinement in the ultrathin 2D plasmonic materials with evanescent tails in the immediate environment can facilitate various engineering tools to efficiently tune the plasmon dispersion, such as by modifying the dielectric environment. This can also potentially induce plasmonic topological transitions, which, as an analogous example, has been explored in phonon polaritons of \u03b1-MoO3, a different but alike quasiparticle involving optical phonons by choosing polar substrates20, 21, forming heterostructures with graphene22-26 and stacking twisted bilayer structures27-33. In addition to the twist angle (TA) in the twisted bilayer, an unexplored tuning parameter is the thickness ratio (TR) of two layers. When two identical hyperbolic films are stacked with TA = 90\u00b0 and TR = 1, polaritons in the resulting bilayers behave in the same way as that in an isotropic surface, which has been demonstrated in twisted \u03b1-MoO3 bilayers 29, 30. On the other hand, a single film, regarded as TA = 90\u00b0 and TR = 0, retains the original hyperbolic regime. In the intermediate values of TR, however, whether the hyperbolic regime\n4 / 18\nexists and how the plasmon topology evolves are still elusive. Moreover, it is interesting to check whether there is a unified theory that can account for the tuning effect of both the film thickness ratio and the twist angle.\nTd-phase WTe2 is a van der Waals Weyl semimetal, which has been demonstrated\nto host in-plane hyperbolic plasmon polaritons naturally in the far infrared range at cryogenic temperatures. A plasmonic topological transition occurs when the operation frequency crosses the lower hyperbolic boundary (about 429 cm-1 for samples at 10 K)34, where the exotic propagation features switching from the in-plane ellipticity to hyperbolicity could occur with dramatic modifications of light-matter interaction strength35. Here, we stack two WTe2 films with different TR and TA values to showcase the synergistic effect of TR and TA, the two basic geometric parameters, as the new compound degree of freedom for on-demand manipulations of plasmonic topology. Importantly, our methods and findings can be extended to other hyperbolic polaritonic systems.\n5 / 18\nFigure 1\uff0eExtinction spectra of unpatterned WTe2 bilayers. (a) to (d), Measured anisotropic extinction spectra with different TR values and a fixed TA of 90\u00b0 (solid curves). The dashed curves are the corresponding fittings (see Supporting Information for fitting details). Insets show the schematics of the 90\u00b0-twisted WTe2 bilayers. (e) to (h) Fitted real (dashed lines) and imaginary (solid lines) parts of conductivities along two new axes for different TR values, with the zero crossing points along b axis marked by red stars. Hyperbolic regimes are indicated by gray shaded areas. IFCs with different topologies are illustrated by insets in (e).\nWe first examine the effective sheet optical conductivity of unpatterned twisted\nbilayers with different TRs but a fixed TA of 90\u00b0 from the infrared extinction spectra. The bilayer structure fabrication process is shown in the Supporting Information. Figures 1a to 1d display the measured extinction spectra of the 90\u00b0-twisted WTe2 bilayers with different TR values (see Supporting Information for measurement details). Here, the extinction spectrum is defined by 1\u2212T/T0, where T and T0 are the transmission of light through the film and the bare substrate respectively, and TR (restricted in 0 to 1) represents the thickness ratio between the top (thinner) and bottom (thicker) films as shown in insets of Figures 1a to 1d. Note that there is no spacer layer between the two WTe2 films. We define a (b) axis of the bottom films as the new a (new b) axis of the bilayers with TA of 90\u00b0, since the bottom films are always thicker in our experiments. All the measurements were performed at 10 K. As shown in Figures 1a to 1d, the anisotropy dwindles at higher TR, as manifested by the reduced difference between the extinction spectra polarized along two new principal axes. In Figure 1d, the spectrum shows nearly no polarization dependence when TR = 1. In view of the ultra-thin thickness of the stacked bilayer (~100 nm) compared to the wavelength (>15 \u03bcm), we treat it as a homogeneous film with its own effective sheet optical conductivity, which can be extracted from the extinction spectra. Figures 1e to 1h show the corresponding extracted imaginary parts of the anisotropic optical conductivity for the bilayer films in Figures 1a to 1d (see Supporting Information for fitting details). Based on the signs of the conductivities along two axes, we can identify the plasmon topology of the bilayer\n6 / 18\n(see Note III of Supporting Information for more details). The hyperbolic regime, denoted as the shaded area, shrinks as TR increases, and the associated topological transition to elliptical regime (indicated by red stars) blueshifts in frequency. Extinction spectra of twisted bilayers with different TA (0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0) and fixed TR=1 (the same thickness for the top and bottom films) are shown in Figure S3 in Supporting Information. TA-induced modulation of the hyperbolic regime can be observed, which was also realized previously for phonon polaritons in twisted \u03b1-MoO3 bilayers 30-33.\n\u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\n\u2032\u2032\u2044 at 460 cm-1 based on Eq. (1). The white curve represents the boundary\nbetween elliptic and hyperbolic regimes with \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032\u2044 = 0.\nThe hyperbolic boundaries determined by the extracted conductivities in\nunpatterned bilayers with fixed TA (TR) are summarized in Figure 2a (Figure 2b) as a function of TR (TA). The lower and upper boundaries are plotted in red and blue spots\n7 / 18\nrespectively. Note that cases for (TR = 0, TA = 90\u00b0) in Figure 2a and (TR = 1, TA = 0\u00b0) in Figure 2b share the same hyperbolic regime, since they both regress to a bare single WTe2 film. In thin bilayers with total thickness much smaller than the free-space light wavelength and the plasmon wavelength, the optical properties of the new system can be captured by the effective sheet optical conductivity tensor \u03c3eff(\ud835\udf14) by summing the tensors of the bottom and top layers weighted by the film thickness (see Note I in the Supporting Information for details)27-29. Thus, we have:\n\u03c3eff(\ud835\udf14) = \ud835\udc611 \u2219 \u03c3 3D(\ud835\udf14) + \ud835\udc612 \u2219 \u03c33D\u0303(\ud835\udf14) (1)\nwhere \u03c33D = [ \u03c3\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\n3D 0 0 \u03c3\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f 3D] is the bulk conductivity tensor, and a rotated tensor \u03c33D\u0303 =\n[ \u03c3\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\n3Dcos2 \ud835\udf03 + \u03c3\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f 3Dsin2 \ud835\udf03 sin \ud835\udf03 cos \ud835\udf03 (\u03c3\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f 3D \u2212 \u03c3\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e 3D)\nsin \ud835\udf03 cos \ud835\udf03 (\u03c3\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f 3D \u2212 \u03c3\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e 3D) \u03c3\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e 3Dsin2 \ud835\udf03 + \u03c3\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\n3Dcos2 \ud835\udf03 ]is used for the top film with a twist\nangle \ud835\udf03; t1 and t2 are the thickness of the bottom and top films respectively, with TR = t2/ t1. The shaded areas in Figures 2a and 2b show the calculated hyperbolic regimes based on Eq. (1), with \u03c33D obtained from the sheet optical conductivity of a single film in Figure 1e normalized by the corresponding film thickness. The hyperbolic boundaries of \u03c3eff(\ud835\udf14) are determined by zeros of the imaginary parts along two new principal axes. As shown in Figures 2a and 2b, the shaded areas are consistent with the measured data points. The lower and upper hyperbolic boundaries blue- and red- shift, respectively, upon the increasing of TR or TA. They finally merge for the case of (TR = 1, TA = 90\u00b0) at the frequency where \u03c3\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032 + \u03c3\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 = 0 in single WTe2 films. Moreover, from the extinction spectra in the bilayers, we can get the Drude weights. The ratio of the fitted Drude weights along the new a and new b axes are displayed in insets of Figures 2a and 2b, showing good consistency with calculated results (black lines) based on Eq. (1). The ratio decreases and approaches to 1 at higher TR or TA values, suggesting the reduced anisotropy of the bilayer.\nWith Eq. (1) and the experimentally obtained \u03c33\ud835\udc37 , the plasmon topology at a\nspecific frequency for bilayers with various TR and TA could be depicted. For instance, the evolution of the ratio \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032\u2044 with TR and TA at 460 cm-1 are displayed in\n8 / 18\nFigure 2c, where \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032 and \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 are the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements of \u03c3eff. This serves as a topology diagram in the TR and TA parameter space. At small TA and TR values, \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032\u2044 is negative, indicating the hyperbolic topology. As TA and TR increase and cross the white curve, at which \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032\u2044 = 0 , a topological transition occurs, demonstrating the capability of topology manipulation both by TA and TR. Such transition occurs at higher TA and TR values for higher plasmon frequencies, consistent with the results in Figures 2a and 2b (see Figure S5, S8 to S10 in the Supporting Information about the calculation of the plasmon dispersion and related topological transitions.).\nThe above extinction spectra of unpatterned bilayers give us valuable information\non the effective optical conductivity and infer the manipulation of plasmon topology. Now let\u2019s directly interrogate the topology by exciting plasmons in patterned structures. To fulfill this, we investigated localized plasmons of skew ribbon arrays. In the experiment, the ribbon width is much larger than the thickness of the bilayer. Schematics of the skew ribbons are shown in Figures 3a and 3c, where ribbon directions are away from the new principal axes. In contrast to the isotropic surface where the plasmon intensity is strongest with light polarized perpendicular to the ribbons, the optimal polarization for anisotropic surface deviates from the perpendicular direction of skew ribbon arrays36. As demonstrated by theory37 and simulations (see Note II and Figure S11 in Supporting Information for details), the optimal polarization angle \u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 is determined by the ratio of the imaginary parts of the sheet optical conductivities along two principal axes with the relation tan (\u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) tan (\ud835\udf03)\u2044 = \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032\u2044 , where \ud835\udf03 is the skew angle for ribbons, as shown in Figure 3c. Note that all the skew ribbon arrays in this work have negative skew angles (\ud835\udf03 < 0). Thus, the plasmon topology can be determined by the sign of \u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65, i.e., elliptic when \u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 < 0, and hyperbolic when \u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 > 0, as illustrated in Figures 3a and 3c.\n9 / 18\n10 / 18\nWith this convenient indicator of the plasmon topology, we first reveal the\nevolution of the topology as a function of the resonance frequency in bilayers with fixed TR or TA values. Figures 3d to 3f show the polarization dependence of the extracted plasmon resonance spectra (an example of the series of raw spectra are displayed in Figure S6 of Supporting Information) in skew ribbon arrays with \ud835\udf03 = \u221233\u00b0, patterned from 90\u00b0-twisted WTe2 bilayers with TR of 0.5. Here, the Drude response and interband transitions have been removed to highlight the variations in the plasmon resonances as a function of the polarization angle. Fitting of the extinction spectrum of a typical skew ribbon array is shown in Figure S12 of Supporting Information (see Supporting Information for fitting details). Those three ribbon arrays show different plasmon resonance frequencies, mainly determined by the predesigned ribbon width. From Figures 3d to 3f, with increasing plasmon frequency, the optimal polarization (marked by red dashed lines) changes from negative to positive values, suggesting an elliptic to hyperbolic topological transition. The raw extinction spectra at the polarization near the maximal and minimal plasmon intensities in Figures 3d and 3f (red and blue squares) are showed as red and blue lines in Figures 3g and 3i, respectively. In Figure 3g, the red curve has the maximal intensity of plasmon and in the meantime the Drude response is nearly negligible, which is similar to that in isotropic surfaces such as graphene38. While in Figure 3i, the Drude response is prominent at the polarization for the maximal plasmon intensity (the red curve) but nearly absent for the minimal plasmon intensity (the blue curve), which is a result of the extreme anisotropy in the hyperbolic regime. The plasmon resonance of the bilayer in Figure 3d has a frequency of 410 cm-1, near the lower hyperbolic boundary (429 cm-1) for single WTe2 films where \u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 is 0\u00b0. However, the fitted \u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 for Figure 3d is -21.3\u00b0, with a significant deviation from 0\u00b0 , indicating the decreased optical anisotropy after 90\u00b0 -twisted stacking at this frequency. Plasmons in Figure 3e with resonance frequency of 486 cm-1 have maximal intensity at polarization along the new a axis (\u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 = 0.002\u00b0), implying that the lower hyperbolic boundary has blueshifted at higher TR values, changing from 429 cm-1 for TR = 0 and TA = 90\u00b0 to about 486 cm-1 for TR = 0.5 and TA = 90\u00b0, consistent with the result in Figure 2a.\n11 / 18\nNext, we check the effect of TR on tuning the plasmon topology in more detail.\nFigures 3b and 3h shows the results of skew ribbon arrays with \ud835\udf03 = \u221233\u00b0 for different TR values with TA of 90\u00b0. They have nearly the same plasmon resonance frequency (\u00b12 cm-1) as that in Figure 3e. In Figure 3b (TR = 0), plasmons have the maximal intensity at \u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 = 15.6\u00b0 , while when TR increases to 0.83, \u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 is -15.5\u00b0 , as shown in Figure 3h. Thus, as TR increases from 0 to 0.83 in Figures 3b, 3e and 3h, the plasmon topology changes from the hyperbolic to the elliptic, demonstrating TRinduced tuning of the plasmon topological transition in 90\u00b0-twisted WTe2 bilayers.\n\u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\n\u2032\u2032\u2044 as a\nfunction of plasmon frequency in bilayers with different TR (a) and TA (b) values. Data points are calculated by \u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 in skew ribbon arrays. Black hollow points in (a) for TR = 0 and (b) for TA = 0\u00b0 are measured in ribbons with skew angle of -23\u00b0 (square points), -33\u00b0 (diamond points), -40\u00b0 (circle points). Other data points are measured in ribbons with skew angle of -33\u00b0. Points in (a) and (b) have TR and TA deviation from nominal values in the range of 0.04 and 1\u00b0 respectively. The solid lines are calculated\n12 / 18\nby summing the top and bottom sheet conductivities based on conductivities determined from the plasmon dispersion in Ref. [34].\nAs mentioned above, the sign of the ratio \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032\u2044 determines the topology\nof plasmons. More quantitatively, this ratio can be obtained experimentally from \ud835\udf03 and \u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 based on tan (\u03a6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) tan (\ud835\udf03)\u2044 = \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032\u2044 , the latter angle of which is determined by fitting the polarization dependence of the plasmon intensity. Data points in Figures 4a and 4b show thus obtained \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032\u2044 for bilayers with different TR (fixed TA = 90\u00b0) and TA (fixed TR = 1), respectively. For single WTe2 films, which correspond to cases of (TR = 0, TA = 90\u00b0) and (TR = 1, TA = 0\u00b0), data points from different skew angles (\ud835\udf03 = \u221223\u00b0, \u221233\u00b0, \u221240\u00b0) are plotted together in Figures 4a and 4b. Other data points for bilayers with higher TR and TA in Figures 4a and 4b are all measured in skew ribbons with \ud835\udf03 of \u221233\u00b0. The solid curves in Figures 4a and 4b are calculated from the effective conductivity tensors by summing sheet conductivities of the top and bottom films (Eq. (1)) using values determined by the plasmon dispersion in Ref. [34] (See Supporting Information for details). As shown in Figures 4a and 4b, data points can be well described by the solid lines, indicating that the effective conductivity tensors work well in plasmonic bilayer structures. In Figure 4a (4b), as TR (TA) increases, the zero point of the conductivity ratio (crossing with the black dashed line) moves to higher frequencies, demonstrating that the lower hyperbolic boundary can be successfully tuned by changing TR (TA). Note that all solid curves in Figures 4a and 4b, except the case for (TR = 1, TA = 90\u00b0), cross atf the same point at around 518 cm-1. This is due to the fact that \u03c3aa \u2032\u2032 + \u03c3bb \u2032\u2032 = 0 at this frequency in single WTe2 films, which renders \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \u2032\u2032 \ud835\udf0eeff \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \u2032\u2032\u2044 equal to -1 regardless of TR and TA values. Such convergence can be also inferred from data points in Figure 4a. Fitting curves using sheet conductivities extracted from the extinction spectra of the bare film in Figure 1e give consistent results with data points in Figures 4a and 4b as well (see Figure S7 of Supporting Information for details). Therefore, a simple addition of film optical conductivities for the stacked bilayer works well in the interpretation of our experimental findings.\n13 / 18\nOur work provides a new avenue to engineer the effective conductivity tensor by\nstacking different films with zero or thin spacing layer and hence to tune the plasmonic functionalities and light-matter interactions. Our experiment demonstrates that TR and TA have comparable effects on tuning plasmon topology in bilayer structures. In fact, tuning thickness ratio is equivalent to tuning the effective sheet conductivity tensor, which gives us a universal method to tailor the topology of homo- or hetero-structures. Note that, however, when the plasmon wavelength is comparable to the film thickness (t) or the distance between the two films (d), the coupling between the two films will be weakened, and a simple sum of conductivities in Eq. (1) to describe the plasmon response tends to fail. For plasmon modes with extremely large wave vectors and the top and bottom layers are separated slightly by a spacer, the coupling goes to zero, leaving the two plasmonic surfaces uncoupled, as suggested in Ref. [29]. Future efforts can be devoted to the tuning of the film distance with a spacer.\nIn summary, we demonstrated the TR- and TA-tuning of plasmon topology in\ntwisted WTe2 bilayer system from 16 \u03bcm to 23 \u03bcm in wavelength by measuring the film extinction spectra and the polarization dependence of the plasmon in skew ribbon arrays. The plasmon topology is demonstrated to be directly governed by the effective conductivity tensor obtained by a sum of the respectively rotated conductivity tensors of the top and bottom layers. The topology manipulation of polaritons in such long wavelength will facilitate many promising applications in far-IR and THz range, such as polarization engineering, enhancement of spontaneous emission, thermal emission management and biosensing.\n14 / 18"
