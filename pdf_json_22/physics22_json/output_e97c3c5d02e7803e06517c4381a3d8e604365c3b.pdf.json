    "abstractText": "Graphene has emerged as an ultrafast photonic material for on-chip all-optical modulation. However, its atomic thickness limits its interaction with guided optical modes, which results in a high switching energy per bit or low modulation efficiencies. Nonetheless, it is possible to enhance the interaction of guided light with graphene by nanophotonic means. Herein, we present a practical design of an all-optical modulator that is based on graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures that are hybrid integrated into silicon slot waveguides. Using this device, a high extinction ratio (ER) of 7.3 dB, an ultralow insertion loss (IL) of <0.6 dB, and energy-efficient switching (<0.33 pJ/bit) are attainable for a 20 \u03bcm long modulator with double layer graphene. In addition, the device performs ultrafast switching with a recovery time of <600 fs, and could potentially be employed as a high-performance all-optical modulator with an ultra-high bandwidth in the hundreds of GHz. Moreover, the modulation efficiency of the device is further enhanced by stacking additional layers of graphene-hBN heterostructures, while theoretically maintaining an ultrafast response. The proposed device exhibits highly promising performance metrics, which are expected to serve the needs of next-generation photonic computing systems.",

INTRODUCTION\nALL-OPTICAL modulators are devices that control theflow of light in a photonic link by applying a timevarying optical signal [1]. Unlike electro-optic modulators, these devices modulate light without performing opticalelectrical-optical conversions that lead to additional radiofrequency time delays in the signal processing [2]. Moreover, they are characterized by ultrafast switching times (<1 ps) [3], and are hence employed for applications in photonic computing, optical logic and optical information processing [4]. However, these modulators consume several picojoules of energy per bit [5]\u2013[7], whereas next-generation photonic devices for telecom and datacom networks require energy-efficient devices with a switching energy that is <1 pJ/bit [8]. Energyefficient modulators with a sub-pJ switching energy have been demonstrated in refs. [9]\u2013[11], but were limited by relatively high switching times (>1 ps). Recently, an all-optical device that is characterized by ultrafast (260 fs) and energy-efficient (35 fJ) switching has been demonstrated in [12]. This device is based on graphene-loaded deep-subwavelength plasmonic\nMohammed Alaloul was with New York University Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, UAE. He is now with the School of Engineering and Information Technology at the University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT 2612, Australia (email: m.alaloul@unsw.edu.au). Jacob B.

Other plasmon-enhanced all-optical graphene modulators have been reported in refs. [13], [14]. Nonetheless, incorporating plasmonic metals into these devices introduces an excessive insertion loss (IL), mainly due to the inherent ohmic losses that are induced by these metals [15]. Consequently, a greater input optical power would be required to achieve a decent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver side, which might hinder the adoption of these devices in next-generation optical interconnects. Graphene is a promising candidate material for next-generation all-optical modulators because of its ultrafast electron heating and cooling dynamics [16]\u2013[18], facile integration into silicon photonics [19]\u2013[21], and compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processes [22]\u2013[24]. Nevertheless, building energy-efficient all-optical graphene modulators is challenging because of graphene\u2019s atomic thickness, which limits its interaction with guided optical modes. Therefore, alternative nanophotonic structures are needed to enhance the interaction of waveguide modes with graphene, while maintaining a low insertion loss in the photonic link. In this work, we propose an all-optical modulator that is based on heterostructures of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that are hybrid integrated into silicon slot waveguides. The use of graphene-hBN heterostructures accelerates the electron cooling dynamics in graphene [25]\u2013 [28], and facilitates the stacking of multiple monolayers of high-quality graphene [29]\u2013[31], while the use of slot waveguides boosts the interaction of the guided optical mode with graphene [32]\u2013[34]. The proposed device performs energyefficient switching (<0.33 pJ/bit) with a high extinction ratio (ER) of 7.3 dB at an ultra-low IL of <0.6 dB for a 20 \u00b5m long modulator with double layer graphene. Furthermore, its switching performance is ultrafast with a theoretical recovery time of <600 fs, respectively, and could potentially be employed as a high-performance all-optical modulator with an ultra-high bandwidth in the hundreds of GHz.\nIn the next section, the device structure and its constituent materials are presented. Following that, the all-optical modulation mechanism is introduced and explained, and the device efficiency is characterized by calculating its switching energy and ER. Then, the same quantities are studied at other wavelengths to characterize the broadband response of the modulator. Subsequently, the device performance is investigated by calculating the rise and fall times of the modulator. Finally, the report is concluded by pointing out the major findings of this study.\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n14 28\n0v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. op\ntic s]\n2 7\nM ar\n2 02\n2\n2\nTABLE I FIXED PARAMETERS IN THE DESIGN OF THE ON-CHIP ALL-OPTICAL MODULATOR.\nParameter h d W W0 w1 w2 Ltap\nValue 250 nm 80 nm 250 nm 400 nm 60 nm 30 nm 8 \u00b5m"

            "text": "The structure of the on-chip modulator is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is composed of a graphene-hBN-graphene heterostructure that is placed on top of a silicon slot waveguide, which in turn sits atop a 3 \u00b5m thick buried oxide (BOX) layer. The dimensions of the device are given in Table I. An 8 \u00b5m long taper is introduced before and after the modulator slot waveguide, to achieve a very high coupling efficiency (\u03ba) of 97% at 1550 nm, which is in agreement with the experimental result that was reported in [35] for a similar structure with the same taper length. The presence of the 2D heterostructure on top of the slot waveguide did not impact the coupling efficiency, because\n(a) (b)\nFig. 3.

The dashed white lines represent the two graphene sheets. (b) Propagation loss (\u03b1) as a function of the number of graphene layers at \u03bb = 1550 nm. The inset presents the numbering scheme of the graphene layers.\nthe simulated power overlap between the optical mode of the slot waveguide with and without it is 99.8%. The slot width (d) was swept while the propagation loss of the waveguide (\u03b1) was recorded, as shown in Fig. 2a. Because graphene is the only absorbing medium, a higher propagation loss corresponds to a higher graphene absorption. The 10 nm hBN layer does not absorb light at telecom wavelengths, because hBN has an energy bandgap of \u223c 6 eV [36]. As will be discussed in the next section, the modulation mechanism is based on the saturable absorption of graphene, so a higher graphene absorption is desirable. It is observed in Fig. 2a that the TE mode yields a higher absorption than the TM one, except at very small slot widths. The smaller the slot width, the more challenging it is to realize the device in practice because of limitations that are related to the minimum feature size in a fabrication process [32]. Therefore, the TE mode is taken as the optimal mode for an 80 nm wide slot, because the absorption efficiency is very high at d = 80 nm, and silicon slot waveguides with a similar width have been demonstrated in refs. [33], [37]. Fig. 2b shows the computed \u03ba and \u03b1 as a function of wavelength, where it is observed that their variations in the studied wavelength range are minimal. These values are later used in section V to characterize the broadband response of the device.\nFig. 3a plots the percentage of power that is absorbed by graphene (AG) as a function of Lmod, where AG is calculated from \u03b1 using the Beer-Lambert Law:\nAG(Lmod) = 1\u2212 10\u2212(\u03b1/10)\u2217Lmod (1)\nThe double layer graphene absorbs more than 95% of the optical power when Lmod = 40 \u00b5m. Additional graphene-hBN layers may be stacked to boost the modulation efficiency of the device, because the absorption increases with the number of graphene layers (see Fig. 3b). For instance, the\n3\npropagation loss exceeds 1 dB/\u00b5m for 10 graphene layers. However, each additional layer may require an additional step that involves exfoliation or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [38], which might complicate the fabrication process. Therefore, the device operation is mainly studied for the case of double layer graphene, whereas the case of multiple graphene layers is briefly discussed. Alternatively, it is possible to scale the absorption by using multi-layered graphene, e.g. bilayer graphene [39]. Nevertheless, the saturable absorption and the heating and cooling dynamics of multi-layered graphene are generally less efficient than in monolayer graphene, as will be discussed in sections IV & VI. Thus, this design is based on stacks of monolayer graphene and hBN to achieve a high modulation efficiency and an ultrafast response while maintaining a low IL."

            "text": "The absorption of graphene can be tuned based on the principle of Pauli-blocking [40]\u2013[42], which occurs when photoexited electrons fill the conduction band states of graphene following a sufficiently intense pump excitation, thereby blocking the interband transition of other electrons [14]. Figure 4a illustrates the interband absorption of a pump photon with an energy ~\u03c9pump > 2|\u00b5|, where \u00b5 is the chemical potential of graphene. Upon absorbing a sufficiently intense pump excitation, electrons fill up the conduction band states, leading to a greater chemical potential \u00b5\u2032. As a consequence, incoming pump photons cannot induce an interband transition because ~\u03c9pump < 2|\u00b5\u2032| [39], and are thus transmitted through graphene (see Fig. 4b). Similarly, a probe photon with an energy ~\u03c9probe \u2264 ~\u03c9pump is also transmitted because ~\u03c9probe < 2|\u00b5\u2032|. By utilizing this phenomenon, all-optical modulation is realized: the probe signal is transmitted when the pump signal is HIGH, or absorbed when the pump signal is LOW [14]. Hence, the modulation mechanism is based on the saturable absorption of graphene [40]\u2013[42]. From Fig. 4b, it can be inferred that \u00b5\u2032 \u2248 ~\u03c9pump/2 [12], [14]. Then, the increase in carrier density (\u2206n) that is needed to saturate the absorption of graphene is given by [14]:\n\u2206n = 1\n\u03c0\n( \u2206\u00b5\n~vF\n)2 (2)\nwhere ~ is the reduced Planck constant, vF is the Fermi velocity, and \u2206\u00b5 = \u00b5\u2032\u2212\u00b5 is the increase in chemical potential that is needed to induce Pauli-blocking. For a graphene sheet with an area A = WL, the number of carriers that are needed to reach \u00b5\u2032 is m = \u2206nWL. For the modulator device that is presented in Fig. 2, L is taken as Lmod, and W is the effective absorbing width (see supplementary section S1). Because each absorbed photon generates an electron-hole pair, the energy that is required to saturate the absorption of graphene (Usw) is expressed as [12], [14]:\nUsw = \u2211\nm\n~\u03c9m (3)\nwhere Usw is the switching energy, and ~\u03c9 is the pump photon energy. Fig. 5a presents the switching energy (Usw) for \u03bbpump = 1550 nm. It is observed that Usw is higher at low chemical potentials and is maximized when the charge neutrality point coincides with the Dirac point (\u00b5 = 0). That is because more electrons are required to fill the conduction band states up to \u00b5\u2032 when \u00b5 is low. Moreover, Usw increases with Lmod because the larger the area, the higher is the switching energy according to m = \u2206nWL and Eq. 3. In practice, graphene may not fully absorb the waveguide mode. In addition, part of the optical mode energy is lost because of the waveguide\u2019s IL. To account for that, the effective switching energy (Ueff) is calculated as [14]:\nUeff = Usw(1 + \u0393 +AWG)\nAG \u2217 (1\u2212Ans) (4)\nwhere \u0393 = 1\u2212\u03ba is the coupling loss, Ans is the non-saturable fraction of AG [43]\u2013[45], and is taken as 5% for monolayer graphene [14], [44], and AWG is the slot waveguide loss that is not related to graphene. A 7 dB/cm propagation loss has been reported in [37], for a silicon slot waveguide with an 80 nm wide slot. This propagation loss is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the propagation loss that is induced by double layer\n4 (a) (b)\nFig. 5.

The calculated Ueff is presented in Fig. 5b for \u03bbpump = 1550 nm. It is observed that Ueff is higher than Usw and shares a similar trend with respect to \u00b5 and Lmod. Graphene is unintentionally doped when placed on a substrate, yielding chemical potentials in the range of 0.1\u2013 0.2 eV [17], [46], [47]. Within that range, Ueff is < 543 fJ at all modulator lengths, and for a 20 \u00b5m long modulator, it is < 326 fJ."

The absorption of graphene is maximized when the pump signal is turned off, whereas the maximum transmission of the probe signal (Tmax) is obtained when a pump signal with an energy U > Ueff is applied.

It is noted that the IL is ultra-low (< 0.6 dB) at all modulator lengths. Figure 6b presents the ER and Ueff as a function of the number of graphene layers for a 10 \u00b5m long modulator. It is observed that the ER increases as the number of graphene layers increases, whereas Ueff decreases, which is consistent with Eqs. 1, 4, 5, 6 & 7, because graphene\u2019s propagation loss increases with the number of graphene layers (see Fig. 3b).

For multilayer graphene, Ans is higher, which results in a higher IL according to Eqs. 6, 7 & 8. For instance, for multi-layer graphene with < 5 layers, the reported Ans is (31.48/74.17)\u2217 100% = 42%, and for graphene with < 9 layers, the reported Ans is (67.85/86.02) \u2217 100% = 78.88% [44]. Therefore, even though multi-layer graphene exhibits a higher optical absorption than monolayer graphene, its saturable absorption is less efficient, which leads to a higher IL. Hence, in this design, multiple layers of monolayer graphene with sandwiched hBN layers are stacked to achieve efficient saturable absorption and a low IL."

This agrees with experimental\n5 observations [45], [49], where it has been reported that a lower pump intensity is required to saturate graphene at longer pump wavelengths. This can be explained by the unique conical dispersion of graphene, which increases and widens at higher chemical potentials.

            "heading": "VI. MODULATION PERFORMANCE",
            "text": "The device performance is determined by the electron heating and cooling dynamics in graphene [14], [40]. Graphene has a unique conical dispersion, where its density of states fades away at the Dirac point. Consequently, electrons in the vicinity of the Dirac point have a relatively low heat capacity. Upon photoexcitation, these electrons immediately scatter with one another, creating an ephemeral Fermi-Dirac distribution of hot thermalized electrons within a few tens to 150 femtoseconds [16]\u2013[18]. Hence, photon energy is converted to electron heat. Eventually, hot electrons cool down in a few picoseconds by emitting optical and acoustic phonons, coupling with surface optical phonons, and most importantly through disorder-assisted scattering which dominates at room temperature [50]\u2013[53]. Thus, electrons first heat up through intraband electron-electron scattering, then they cool down through phonon- and disorder-assisted scattering. In addition, fewer layer graphene is characterized by faster electron heating and cooling dynamics [14], [44], [54].\nIn [32], a high-responsivity graphene-on-silicon slot waveguide photodetector has been demonstrated. Nonetheless, the performance of this device was limited by its \u223c 50 \u00b5s rise time, which would correspond to a 7 KHz electrical bandwidth based on BWe = 0.35/tr, where BWe is the electrical bandwidth, and tr is the rise time [55]. In the literature, waveguideintegrated graphene photodetectors have been demonstrated with a bandwidth exceeding 110 GHz [56]\u2013[58]. The relatively low bandwidth of the aforementioned graphene-onsilicon slot waveguide photodetector was attributed to the slow carrier heating and cooling dynamics in suspended graphene, where substrate-induced disorder-assisted scattering is absent. In another work [59], a graphene-on-silicon slot waveguide photodetector has been demonstrated, but with a 10 nm hBN layer placed beneath the graphene sheet. The reported bandwidth for this device was 65 GHz, even though its structure is not much different from the one reported in [32]. Graphene is not suspended when it forms a Van der Waals (vdW) heterostrcuture with hBN. The electron cooling dynamics in graphene\u2013hBN vdW heterostructures are dominated by hot electron coupling to hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs), not disorder-assisted scattering [17], [25]\u2013[27]. Experimentally, graphene on hBN demonstrated faster electron cooling dynamics than graphene on Si/SiO2 substrates [25], [28]. Therefore, the cooling pathway introduced by HPhPs is more efficient than disorder-assisted scattering, which could explain the enhanced bandwidth of the device reported in [59].\nFig. 8. Electron cooling time (\u03c4cool) as a function of chemical potential (\u00b5).\nAn all-optical modulator that is based on graphene-onsilicon slot waveguides has not yet been demonstrated, to the best of our knowledge. As such, the electron heating and cooling dynamics and the corresponding response times of these devices are not reported in the literature. To ensure that our device performs ultrafast modulation and does not suffer from inefficient electron heating and cooling dynamics, hBN is sandwiched between the two graphene layers. In this heterostructure, the electron heat transfer channel is outof-plane [25], which means that the sandwiched hBN layer provides a cooling pathway for both the upper and the lower graphene layers.\nIn order to calculate the recovery time of the switch, the electrical conductivity of graphene is first calculated using the following relation [63], [64]:\n\u03c3 = \u03c30(1 + \u00b52\n\u22062 ) , \u03c30 = 5(\ne2 h ) (9)\nwhere h is Planck\u2019s constant. \u03c30 is the minimum conductivity taken from [63], and \u2206 \u2248 25 meV (. 300 K) is a typical width of the charge neutrality region for graphene on a BN substrate [65]. \u2206 is a fitting parameter that accounts for disorder in graphene, and it determines the mobility and the slope of the conductivity curve. Higher disorder is manifested in the form of a wider charge neutrality region in the conductivity plot [17], [52]. By fitting the conductivity curve using Eq. 9, it is possible to model graphene with different carrier mobilities. The electron cooling time is taken as the electron relaxation time. For the case of graphene-on-hBN, it can be calculated from \u03c3 using the following relation [66]:\n\u03c4cool = 2\u03c3\ne2v2FD , D =\ng\u00b5\n2\u03c0~2v2F (10)\nwhere e is the electron charge, D is the density of states of graphene, and g = 4 is the total degeneracy due to the spin degeneracy and the valley degeneracy [39]. Fig. 8 presents the calculated \u03c4cool as a function of \u00b5, which is found out to be < 600 fs within the \u00b5 range of 0.1\u2013 0.2 eV, where \u00b5 is related to the carrier density (n) by \u00b5 = ~vF \u221a n [39]. This result is similar to the experimentally reported electron cooling times for graphene-on-hBN, which were in the range of 200\u2013 400 fs in [28]. The switching time of the device is on the order of the electron heating time (< 150 fs) [16]\u2013 [18], because this is the time in which a sea of hot electrons is induced following a pump excitation; these electrons fill\n6\nup the conduction band states leading to Pauli-blocking [67]. Then, the modulator reverts to its steady-state in a timescale of \u223c \u03c4cool, which is < 600 fs in the case that is considered in Fig. 8. Based on these values, this device can theoretically operate as an all-optical modulator with a bandwidth in the hundreds of GHz [40]. The heating and cooling dynamics of additional graphene-hBN layers are expected to be similar to the case of double layer graphene, because each graphene layer forms a vdW heterostructure with hBN.\nThe pump fluence affects the carrier cooling time. In [28], pump-probe spectroscopy of graphene-hBN heterostructures was performed with pump fluences of 80 \u00b5J/cm2, 60 \u00b5J/cm2, and 50 \u00b5J/cm2, for which the extracted carrier cooling times were 375 fs, 250 fs, and 200 fs (\u00b125 fs), respectively. These cooling times are similar to the electron cooling times that are presented in Fig. 8. Therefore, the energy of the pump signal does not need to be higher than Ueff, because the electron cooling time increases at higher pump fluences, which in turn decreases the switching performance of the device. The studied vdW heterostructure in [28], consisted of graphene on a hBN layer. In addition, it has been reported that the encapsulation of graphene in hBN induces ultrafast cooling pathways of hot electrons by HPhPs [25], [26]. It is possible to design high-performance all-optical modulators by building Gr/hBN heterostructures or by encapsulating graphene in hBN.\nTable II presents the reported performance metrics of demonstrated on-chip all-optical graphene switches and modulators. The device that is presented in [12], is based on graphene-loaded plasmonic slot waveguides. It achieves the highest modulation efficiency (0.875 dB/\u00b5m) and the lowest switching energy (35 fJ), but is limited by an excessive IL. To meet the demands of next-generation telecom and datacom networks, photonic devices with an IL < 5 dB are required [8]. Nevertheless, this device has made a significant contribution in all-optical switching because it has demonstrated an unprecedented recovery time of 260 fs using graphene. The authors explained that this result could be because of the ultrafast carrier diffusion out of the 30 nm narrow slot region. To the best of our knowledge, a dedicated study of the influence of the graphene sheet area on the carrier relaxation time has not been reported in the literature. It is not inconceivable that the ultrafast recovery time of 260 fs was brought about by the small graphene sheet area. In fact, pump-probe spectroscopy of waveguide-integrated germanium revealed that the lifetime of photoexcited carriers increases with the germanium length\nand width [68]. This could also be the case for waveguideintegrated graphene devices. Therefore, it might be possible to achieve ultrafast switching beyond a recovery time of 260 fs, by building Gr/hBN all-optical modulators with a small device area; the smaller area enables faster carrier diffusion across the device, and the use of Gr/hBN heterostructures achieves ultrafast carrier cooling that is four times faster than that on a SiO2 substrate [28]. Therefore, further investigation of the influence of the graphene sheet area on the carrier cooling dynamics is required. In practice, however, the absorption of graphene is small, which necessitates the need for longer devices. The use of Gr/hBN heterostructures accelerates the carrier cooling dynamics of graphene, even for large area sheets. For instance, a 200 fs (\u00b125 fs) carrier cooling time at a pump fluence of 50\u00b5J/cm2 was reported in [28], for a Gr/hBN heterostructure that is tens of micrometres long. The non-plasmonic devices that were reported in [60]\u2013[62] have a much lower IL and can achieve high modulation efficiencies at large L, but their switching energies may exceed 1 pJ/bit at these lengths. Though this device is longer than other devices, it achieves a relatively high modulation efficiency (0.365 dB/\u00b5m), energy-efficient switching (< 326 fJ) and ultrafast recovery (< 600 fs) at an almost negligible IL of 0.45 dB.\nThe fabrication process of Si sot waveguides is presented in [32], where the waveguide pattern is defined on a commercial silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate using electron beam lithography (EBL). Optoelectronic devices with a Gr/hBN/Gr heterostructure were fabricated in [69]. This heterostructure is prepared by the dry transfer technique [70], where graphene and hBN layers are first separately exfoliated onto Si/SiO2 substrates, and each layer is then picked up by a polymer stamp. In [71], hBN was picked up by a single layer graphene that is attached to a PMMA membrane. By picking up an additional layer of graphene, a Gr/hBN/Gr heterostructure is formed. In [61], a waveguide-integrated all-optical graphene modulator with partially suspended graphene was demonstrated. There, a PMMA/Gr film was transferred onto the waveguides and patterned by EBL to control the modulation depth of the device. The redundant graphene layer was etched off by reactive ion etching (RIE) using oxygen. PMMA was removed by soaking the chip in acetone. By following a similar approach, a PMMA film with a Gr/hBN/Gr heterostructure could be transferred onto the Si slot waveguides, to build the double-graphene modulator that is shown in Fig. 1a.\n7 The presence of surface defects in graphene, like wrinkles, induces a scattering loss, which increases the non-saturable fraction of the absorption (Ans) [44]. This in turn degrades the modulation efficiency, increases the switching energy, and contributes to a higher IL. Further advances in graphene transfer methods will contribute to the development of more efficient and reliable graphene-based devices."

Simulations were performed to optimize the design, where an 8 \u00b5m long taper is introduced to achieve a 97% coupling efficiency between the slotted modulator waveguide and silicon strip waveguides. Moreover, the switching energy, modulation efficiency, broadband response, and modulation performance of the device were investigated. Using this device, a high extinction ratio (ER) of 7.3 dB, an ultra-low insertion loss (IL) of <0.6 dB, and energyefficient switching (<0.33 pJ/bit) are attainable for a 20 \u00b5m long modulator with double layer graphene. In addition, it performs ultrafast switching with a recovery time of < 600 fs, and could potentially be employed as a high-performance all-optical modulator with an ultra-high bandwidth in the hundreds of GHz. Furthermore, stacking additional layers of Gr/hBN heterostructures enhances the modulation efficiency of the device, while theoretically maintaining the same ultrafast response. The high-performance metrics of this device across a wide wavelength range are expected to serve the needs of next-generation optical computing systems."

This \u03b1 value was obtained by simulating a 3 \u00b5m wide graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers on top of the silicon slot waveguide (see Fig. S1). It might be assumed that the portion of graphene that is on top of the slotted region is the one that solely contributes to the absorption of the waveguide mode, because that is where the waveguide mode is mostly confined. However, when simulating the same structure but with 80 nm wide graphene and hBN layers on top of the slotted region (see Fig. S2), the resulting \u03b1 is merely 0.2 dB/\u00b5m. This indicates that other portions of the graphene sheet significantly contribute to the absorption. Therefore, the width of the graphene and hBN layers is swept to find out the effective absorbing width which would yield a \u223c 0.35 dB/\u00b5m propagation loss. It is found out that 1.4\u00b5m wide graphene and hBN layers yield a \u223c 0.35 dB/\u00b5m propagation loss (see Fig. S3). Hence, 1.4 \u00b5m is taken as the effective absorbing width for calculating the switching energy.\nFigure S1: Electric field profile of the TE mode for the double layer device with 3 \u00b5m wide graphene and hBN layers. \u03bb = 1550nm.

Therefore, there is a 2-step enhancement of the absorption for the case of multiple Gr/hBN layers. First, the guided optical mode is enhanced at the air/Si interface in the slotted region, which increases the effective absorption of graphene, then the absorption is also enhanced by the partial presence of the guided optical mode in the Gr/hBN layers. To illustrate this, Fig. S4 shows the computed TE-mode with five layers of graphene. Furthermore, as the number of graphene and hBN layers increase, a greater portion of the optical mode is guided in these layers, which introduces a higher mode mismatch with the original strip waveguide mode. This in turn results in a higher coupling loss and a higher insertion loss (IL), as shown in Fig. S5.\nFigure S4: The computed electric field profile of the TE mode for the device with five layers of graphene. \u03bb = 1550nm.
