    "abstractText": "The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in SARS-CoV-2 is a highly conserved enzyme responsible for viral genome replication/transcription. Here we investigate computationally natural non-cognate vs cognate nucleotide addition cycle (NAC) and intrinsic nucleotide selectivity during the viral RdRp elongation, focusing prechemically from initial nucleotide substrate binding (enzyme active site open) to insertion (active site closed) of RdRp in contrast with one-step only substrate binding process. Current studies have been first carried out using microsecond ensemble equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Due to slow conformational changes (from the open to closed) accompanying nucleotide insertion and selection, enhanced or umbrella sampling methods have been further employed to calculate free energy profiles of the non-cognate NTP insertion. Our studies show notable stability of noncognate dATP and GTP upon initial binding in the active-site open state. The results indicate that while natural cognate ATP and Remdesivir drug analogue (RDV-TP) are biased to be stabilized in the closed or insertion state, the natural non-cognate dATP and GTP can be well trapped in off-path initial binding configurations. Current work thus presents an intrinsic nucleotide selectivity mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp for natural substrate fidelity control in viral genome replication.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve [1] and pose a threat to human life [2]. While the vaccines developed are demonstrating success, there remains an imperative to accelerate antiviral development on therapeutics, considering virus\u2019s evolution and resistance, vaccine hesitancy among individuals, or the inability of some countries to afford the available vaccines. While much of the drug development is focused\non targeting the viral spike protein [3\u20135] or the main protease [6\u20138], there are significant challenges. The spike protein is known for its high variability [1,9,10] and the protease [11] can also mutate, becoming resistant to drugs, as seen in HCV [12, 13]. In contrast, the core replication machinery of SARS-CoV-2, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or nonstructural protein nsp12, is a highly conserved drug target [14, 15]. Here we focus on studying SARS-CoV-2 RdRp to understand its underlying function and mechanism that is crucial for future drug development [16], particularly given the significant gaps in knowledge regarding the functioning of viral RdRps [17\u201319].\nUpon the pandemic upheaval in 2020, a few high-resolution cryo-EM structures of SARSCoV-2 RdRp were released immediately, including apo with the RdRp active site open [20,21] and a post-catalysis form with the active site closed [21]. The post-catalysis structure was bound with a nucleotide drug analogue from remdesivir (RDV) [21]. These structures were in complex with segments of the nsp7/nsp8 cofactors. Later, additional high-resolution structures were resolved with longer nsp8 being \u201csliding poles\u201d [22], as well as RdRp in conjunction with the nsp13 helicase enzyme [23], and in both pre- and post- translocation states [24]. Further structures illustrated RdRp backtracking [25] or stalling [26] due to the interaction with the drug analogue RDV. Similarly, there were structures obtained with favipiravir, another nucleotide analogue drug [27, 28]. Overall, these structures adopt the post-catalysis state [21] in the nucleotide addition cycle (NAC) of the viral RdRp, leaving the initial nucleotide binding (active site open) and pre-catalytic insertion or substrate (closed) states unresolved. It was until very recently that the insertion state with ATP as a cognate nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) bound in the active site was resolved [29]. Currently, the initial binding or open state structure of RdRp remains unresolved, although such a structure has been identified for the Poliovirus [30] (PV) or Enterovirus [31] (EV) RdRp, which share structural similarities with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.\nEfforts to identify drug inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp have been made extensively [16,32,33]. Computational docking has often been employed, which predominantly focus on nucleotide immediate binding to an apo-form RdRp structure [34,35], non-differentiating the active open or closed form, and overlooking initially the functional RdRp (nsp12) elongation complex composed additionally of nsp8, nsp7, and RNA strands. Moreover, while atomic molecular dynamics (MD) studies have provided insights into interactions of nucleotide analogues with the viral RdRp, they often utilize directly the insertion state [36\u201338], ignoring the initial nucleotide analogue binding stage that can be essential for nucleotide screening or selectivity upon entry. Meanwhile, single-molecule studies have offered a glimpse into the dynamics of the elongation cycle, revealing that RdRp can adopt fast, slow, or very slow catalytic pathways with variable rates contingent upon the kinetic pathway [39]. Additionally, information in regard to the RdRp translocation in the NAC has advanced through the cryoEM studies, which demonstrated a structural rearrangement in nsp8 to accommodate the exiting RNA duplex [24]. Computational work has shown that the incorporation of RDV-TP into the primer strand results in a steric clash at the conserved motif-B of the RdRp lead-\ning to an unstable post-translocation state int comparison with pre-translocation, i.e., as a mechanism for antiviral analogue termination of elongation [40]. An alternative suggestion based on single-molecule studies [39] proposes that RdRp backtracks up to 30 nucleotides (nts) after RDV-TP incorporation, which can be interpreted as elongation termination in standard assays. Despite these efforts on quantitative studies of the RdRp NAC, a critical gap remains in understanding initial nucleotide substrate binding to insertion, which is fundamental for nucleotide selectivity and antiviral drug design, given the substrate screening and pre-chemistry inhibition as essential fidelity checkpoints in stepwise NAC [41\u201343].\nAccompanied with the nucleotide substrate binding to insertion, a substantial protein conformational transition happens, which is likely to be a rate limiting step in the NAC, as demonstrated in structurally similar single-subunit RNA or DNA polymerases (RNAPs or DNAPs) [44\u201346]. Such a rate-limiting pre-chemical step accordingly plays a highly essential role in the nucleotide substrate selectivity [47]. To quantify the process with energetics, we calculated the free energy profile or the potential of mean force (PMF) of the nucleotide insertion, recently for cognate substrate ATP and the corresponding nucleotide drug analogue RDV-TP [48]. We found that both ATP and RDV-TP become significantly more stabilized in the insertion state than upon initial binding. In contrast to natural substrate ATP, RDVTP behaves differently in its interaction with the template nt. Cognate ATP forms the Watson-Crick (WC) base pairing with template uracil at the +1 position, from the initial binding through to insertion. On the other hand, RDV-TP initially forms base stacking with the template nt at +1 upon binding. It then inserts into the active site, facing an energetic barrier that is marginally low or comparable to that of cognate ATP [48].\nNote that RDV-TP analogue differs from the cognate ATP by only a few atoms: with a 1\u2019 cyano group attached on the sugar C1\u2019 and 3 atomic replacements on the base. Interestingly, we have also noticed that one conserved motif-F (R553+R555) essentially facilitates the insertion of cognate ATP via interactions with the ATP-triphosphate tail. While such phosphate interactions could potentially hinder the drug analogue RDV-TP insertion, it was subtly avoided upon sufficient thermal fluctuations from the template nt+1 that forms base stacking with RDV-TP [48].\nIn current work, we focus on characterizing the intrinsic nucleotide polymerase enzyme selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, i.e., the selectivity or differentiation between natural cognate NTP (ATP here) and natural non-cognate NTP substrates. To do that, we examined the nucleotide insertion dynamics of non-cognate dATP and GTP, in comparison with cognate ATP and RDV-TP analogue, and calculated the insertion PMFs of dATP and GTP starting from initial binding stage. Since the polymerase NAC lasts over tens of milliseconds in general [39], the rate-limiting transition accompanies the nucleotide binding to insertion (or active site from open to closed) of RdRp is expected to be on the millisecond timescale [44\u201346]. Therefore, such an insertion process cannot be sampled directly using equilibrium MD simulation that is limited by the sub-microsecond to microseconds timescale [49, 50]. To obtain free energetics of such a dynamics process, we extended our previous methodology on employing umbrella sampling MD simulations to construct the PMFs of various NTPs from initial binding to insertion [48,51]. We first constructed atomic structural models of the RdRp-nsp7nsp8-RNA complexes bound with the noncognate nucleotide (ncNTP) species, in both initial binding and insertion states. Subsequently, we performed all-atom equilibrium simulations at sub-microseconds in ensembles to characterize the respective initial binding and insertion\nstates of the non-cognate dATP/GTP bound RdRp complexes. Lastly, we obtained the PMFs of the dATP/GTP insertion processes using the umbrella sampling MD simulations, following initial insertion paths constructed on top of collective reaction coordinates (RCs), according to displacements of atomic coordinates from seven highly conserved structural motifs of RdRp (A to G) and incoming NTP (with and without the associating template nt). Our aim is to elucidate the intrinsic nucleotide selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, which turns out to be primarily relying on \u2018trapping\u2019 the non-cognate nucleotide species upon entry or initial binding to certain configurations at the active site and preventing them from further insertion."

The model for RDV-TP in the insertion state was created using a post-catalytic structure bound with RDV-TP (PDBid:7BV2) as a reference, which also includes catalytic Mg2+ ions [21]. For the ATP insertion model, we positioned ATP over the RDV-TP in the insertion model. The RDV-TP initial binding model was created using an apo structure (PDBid:7BTF) [20] aligned with the RDV-TP insertion structure, with RNA, RDV-TP, and Mg2+ ions copied over. The ATP initial binding model was built following the same process as described above. The dATP states were built using the ATP models as reference and removing the 2\u2019 OH group. Alternatively, GTP was aligned with the ATP models with subsequent geometry optimization to force wobble (WB) base pairing (see Figure 2 lower right) [52].

Pressure was kept at 1 bar using Berendsen barostat [61] during equilibration and Parrinello-Rahman barostat [62] for production, targeted MD (TMD), and umbrella simulation runs. Each system was minimized for a maximum of 50000 steps using steepestdescent algorithm, followed by a slow equilibration with restraints released (every 1 ns) going from NVT (canonical or constant volume and temperature) ensemble to NTP (constant pressure and temperature) as previously used [48].\nFor each NTP initial binding and inserted states ten 100 ns equilibration trajectories were launched, with 10 ns removed from the start, to create 900 ns for each NTP state, totaling \u223c7.2 \u00b5s of simulation time for RDV-TP/ATP/dATP/GTP in both open and closed conformation states.

In the case of ncNTP we visually inspected to select a base pair geometry between the incoming NTP and template nt+1 from the well sampled or representative regions Figure 2.\nAfter selecting the reference structures, a path of the NTP insertion is generated for umbrella sampling using target molecular dynamics (TMD) [65] simulations. We create a forward path (open to closed ref) and a backward path (closed to open), applying force along the following RC or atomic coordinates (X): nsp12 motifs (motif A-G backbone atoms), NTP (heavy atoms), and additionally tested two protocols [48]: i) include or with force on the template nt +1 ii) exclude or without force on the template nt +1.\nFrom the TMD paths created between the two reference structures (with only the first half of the respective paths included to avoid large deviations from the references), intermediate structures were evenly (every 0.1 A\u030a along the RC) selected to be used in launching umbrella sampling simulations. The force constants used in the TMD were carried over for umbrella sampling simulations (see Table S2). The collected RC value histograms were then reweighted using the weighted histogram analysis method [66] as implemented by the WHAM package [67]. For each set of trajectories making up the umbrella windows, 10-ns trajectory was removed from the start, followed by convergence check for every 10ns. For dATP and GTP, the convergence time ranged from 50ns-60ns (Figure S6), in the case of no force applied on the template nt +1. GTP and dATP used 24 and 21 windows, respectively, for a total of \u223c1.2 \u00b5s of simulation time per PMF. Additionally, error bars are estimated using the bootstrapping error analysis method [68] implemented in the WHAM package. For a thorough description on utilizing the umbrella sampling method for constructing the PMFs for ATP and RDV-TP insertion see previous work [48,64].\nTo additionally examine the insertion structures simulated from umbrella sampling, we used steered molecular dynamics (SMD) to check whether the stability of the inserted GTP/dATP show consistencies with the umbrella sampling or the PMFs constructed. The SMD was implemented controlling two center of mass (COM) distances defined as between the heavy atoms of the NTP and the C\u03b1 atoms from residues within 10 A\u030a of the 3\u2019 end primer. The distance between the two COMs was increased at a slow rate of 1 A\u030a per 100 ns, with a force constant set to 2.4 kcal\nmolA\u030a2 ."

We began by measuring and comparing the RMSDs of the protein subdomains, RNA and NTP\u2019s using the respective energy minimized structures for insertion or initial binding as references (see Figure 1 & SI Figure S1). For all four NTP binding, the fingers subdomain RMSD is centered around \u223c1.3 A\u030a and the palm subdomain remains similarly aligned with fingers, especially in the insertion state. The thumb subdomain has a comparatively wide distribution of RMSD in all cases, indicating conformational flexibility. All NTP display less variability in the insertion state, along with the fingers/palm subdomain (SI Figure S1). The cognate ATP and RDV-TP analogue both exhibit lower RMSDs than non-cognate\ndATP or GTP in the insertion state. For initial binding, the RMSDs of GTP along with the RNA scaffold are much larger than that for the other NTP binding. Additionally we compared the RMSDs of the seven conserved motifs (see Figure 1, SI Figure S2 and Table S1/S2). Both motif B and C show comparatively low RMSDs in the insertion state. Motif-C demonstrates notable stability among all motifs for all inserted NTPs, likely due to it hosting the key catalytic residues (S759/D760/D761). The RMSDs of other structural motifs displayed significant variations upon initial binding of different NTPs. In the insertion state, motifs F and G show more distinctions dynamically than rest of motifs for different NTP substrates.\nNext, we examined the base association or pairing geometry between the initially binding/insertion NTP and template +1 nt (Figure 2). In the insertion equilibrium ensemble (active site closed), we observed that the NTP-template distance distribution predominately centers at \u223c6.5 A\u030a and base plane angle \u223c30\u00b0, resulting in either the stable Watson-Crick (WC) base pairing (for ATP/RDV-TP/dATP-template) or wobble base pairing (WB) interactions (for GTP-template uracil). The probability of WC/WB base pairing is high for ATP (69%), RDV-TP (94%) and GTP (70%), low for dATP (47%). Indeed, dATP upon insertion\ndisplays more flexibility than other NTPs in association with the template nt (see Figure 2 upper right). In the NTP initial binding ensemble (active site open), the NTP-template association geometries vary significantly. Upon ATP initial binding, as a significant amount of WC population (48%) is identified, a comparable amount of un-paired or weakly paired (single HB) ATP-template uracil configurations are also present. Upon initial binding of RDV-TP, three configurations have been identified, with either the WC base pairing (36%) or base stacking (38%) being stabilized, and (26%) unpaired [48]. For non-cognate NTPs, the initially bound dATP marginally forms WC base pairing (12%) with the template nt, while GTP upon initial binding cannot forms stabilized WB base pairing with the template uracil.\nAdditionally, we measured the geometry between the NTP and 3\u2019 end primer (SI Figure S3). From different NTP insertion ensembles, the NTP-3\u2019 end primer distribution centers closely around \u223c4-6 A\u030a and a base plane angle \u223c150\u00b0 to 170\u00b0, showing stability. In contrast, upon initial binding, the mismatch GTP associated with the 3\u2019 end primer in largely diverse geometries (distance spans from 4 to 13A\u030a and the angle varies from 20\u00b0 to 170\u00b0). The noncognate dATP upon initial binding also shows diverse geometries in association with the 3\u2019 end primer (distance spans from 4 to 9 A\u030a and the angle varies from 40\u00b0 to 180\u00b0). For cognate ATP and RDV-TP, the initial binding geometries with respect to the 3\u2019 end primer are much more localized, i.e., the distance dominantly spans from 4 to 5 A\u030a, with small populations in between 8-10 A\u030a; the angle varies from around 100\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 below than the non-cognate species. In summary, in the active site closed state or insertion equilibrium ensemble, various NTPs display much less variation of geometries with respect to the template +1 nt or the 3\u2019 end primer than those in the active site open state or initial binding equilibrium ensemble. The highly diverse configurations of initially bound NTP (particularly non-cognate NTP) suggest that detection of various species of incoming NTP starts well from the beginning, i.e., upon the initial NTP binding when the active site remains open.\nFurthermore, we also measured the HB occupancies for various NTPs in respective associations with the protein, template +1 nt, and 3\u2019 end RNA primer (histogram statistics shown in SI Figure S4), for both the NTP initial binding and insertion equilibrium ensembles. We observed an increase in HB occupancies between the NTP triphosphate tail and protein from initial binding to the inserted ensembles for ATP and dATP, with more protein-sugar HBs for the inserted ATP (with D623 and N691) than for the inserted dATP. On the other hand, the inserted RDV-TP ends up with fewer protein-triphosphate HBs than the inserted ATP but much stronger HBs (with T687 and N691) in the protein-sugar association. Meanwhile, GTP insertion led to many but weak (low occupancy) HBs formed, indicative of some instability.\nAdditionally (see SI Figure S5), in the open state, several protein residues (motif-F K551, K545, A558 and motif-B S682) form HBs with template +1 nt upon initial binding of GTP. While protein S501 (from motif G) forms HB with template +1 nt strongly in the presence of ATP (71%) and RDV-TP (78%), or marginally upon dATP (40%) and not present in GTP. In the closed state, the S501-template HB persists and becomes highly stabilized for every NTP insertion state. These findings again reflect distinctive HB patterns formed around the active site upon association of various NTPs, from initial binding to insertion. Nevertheless, due to various populations of NTP binding configurations, especially in the non-cognate initial binding state, it is not clear which HB interactions contribute to stabilize\nor destabilize cognate vs ncNTPs for nucleotide selectivity."

            "text": "tial binding to insertion\nUpon conformational samplings from the equilibrium ensemble simulations, we noticed essential variations of protein structural motifs along with diverse NTP dynamics. Accordingly, we included structural motifs and NTP configurations into constructing a collective reaction coordinate, based on RMSD changes with respective to the open and closed state [20, 21] structures (see Methods) [48,51]. Upon selecting appropriate reference states for each NTP initial binding/insertion system, we then proceeded to calculate the free energy profiles or PMFs of NTP insertion and to quantify the processes for NTP selectivity from initial binding (active site open) to the insertion (closed). The procedures of the PMF construction can be found in Methods. In current studies, we constructed the PMFs of the non-cognate GTP and dATP insertion, so that we can compare with the PMFs obtained previously for cognate ATP and RDV-TP [48].\nFrom the constructed PMF, GTP upon initial binding displays stabilization in comparison with the insertion state, with \u2206G = Ginsertion \u2212Ginitial binding \u223c2 kcal/mol (> 0). This is in contrast with cognate ATP and RDV-TP analogue insertion, which are more stabilized in the insertion state, demonstrating \u2206G (< 0) values of -5.2 kcal/mol and -2.7 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 3) [48]. Nevertheless, the initially bound GTP forms no WB base pairing with the template nt+1, whereas approximately 81% WB base pairing between GTP and the template is identified in the insertion state. Hence, there have to be other interactions to stabilize the initial binding GTP (to be addressed in next subsection). Additionally, the PMF calculations show that the non-cognate GTP is subject to an insertion barrier hins \u223c7 kcal/mol from the initial binding state, much larger than that of ATP and RDV-TP (hins \u223c2.6 kcal/mol and 1.5 kcal/mol, respectively; see Figure 3) [48]. Note that the convergence of the PMF for GTP was reached after 50 ns per window in the umbrella sampling simulation, following the protocol without (or with) enforcing on the uracil template +1 nt (SI Figure S6), which show similar results.\nThe placement of the GTP insertion PMF relative to that of ATP/RDV-TP was conducted according to alchemical simulations performed recently [72]. Given that the GTPtemplate WB base pairing geometries are comparatively stable in the insertion state (Figure 3 lower right), we placed the GTP insertion state \u223c3 kcal/mol above that of the ATP insertion state, as the alchemical calculations indicate that \u2206\u2206Gbinding 2.95 \u00b1 0.66 kcal/mol for the relative binding free energy of GTP with respect to ATP in the insertion state [72].\nThe dATP insertion PMF demonstrates significantly more stability in the initial binding state, with \u2206G \u223c8.0 kcal/mol comparing with the insertion state. Meanwhile, the insertion state of dATP can be hardly or only marginally stabilized. Besides, the non-cognate dATP is subject to an insertion barrier hins \u223c9.6 kcal/mol, the highest among all NTP insertion cases examined (Figure 3). Similar to GTP, dATP does not form WC base pairing with the template nt+1 in the initial binding state but is capable of forming partial WC pairing with the template, though intermittently (64%), in the insertion state umbrella sampling windows. Therefore, there must also be some additional interactions stabilize or trapping\ndATP in the initial binding state, as reflected from the highly tilted PMF toward the initial binding state. Similar to GTP case, the constructed PMF of dATP reached convergence after 50 ns per window of the umbrella sampling simulation, following the protocol without (or with) force applied on the Uracil template (Figure S6), which both show similar results.\nThe placement of the dATP insertion PMF relative to that of ATP/RDV-TP is, however, less certain. Given a wide range of association configurations between dATP and template even in the insertion state (Figure 2 upper right), one cannot directly use the alchemical calculation results, which were conducted around local configurational space (for stabilized ATP and slightly destabilized dATP) with limited sampling [72]. An estimation is nevertheless made here, based on relative binding free energy calculated locally between dATP and cognate ATP (\u223c2 kcal/mol) along with that from the mmPBSA calculation (\u223c7 kcal/mol) [72], suggesting a range of free energetic values 2-7 kcal/mol in between the inserted dATP and ATP (shown as parameter \u03b4g in Figure 3).\nIn order to further test the consistency of the PMF of insertion results for both GTP and dATP, we used SMD simulations to probe the stability of the insertion states for GTP (Figure S7) and dATP (Figure S8), respectively. To do that, the non-cognate GTP or dATP starting from the insertion state is pulled slightly away from the active site in the SMD simulations (see Methods), i.e., to start from the insertion state (active site closed) to the initial binding state (open) under the SMD force. In the case of GTP, it was robustly maintained within the insertion state without being able to cross the barrier (from closed to open) from three trials of the SMD simulations (one 500 ns, two 300 ns). In contrast, dATP was able to be readily pulled from the insertion state toward the initial binding state (closed to open) under the SMD force in all three simulations (300 ns each), demonstrating much lower stability or barrier from closed to open than that of GTP. These observations further support the instability of the dATP insertion state in comparison with the GTP insertion state, as being reflected from the PMFs constructed (3).\nNext, we would proceed to examine additional interactions that stabilize or trap the non-cognate dATP or GTP in their initial binding state, i.e., as revealed from the PMFs constructed from the umbrella sampling simulation. However, before that, we want to examine whether the conformational space sampled between dATP/GTP and the template nt+1 near the initial binding (open) and insertion (closed) equilibrium in the umbrella sampling simulations overlap well with that from the equilibrium ensemble simulations. To do that, the NTP-template +1 nt base pairing geometries are compared between the equilibrium ensemble and the umbrella sampling simulations, from the latter three umbrella windows around the open/closed equilibrium were selected (40 ns RDV-TP/GTP/dATP and 160 ns ATP of simulation time per window). In Figure 4, one can see that the sampled geometries from the umbrella samplings are comparatively restricted, especially in the NTP initial binding state, but overlap well with the dominant configurations sampled from the equilibrium ensemble simulations, in particular, in the insertion state. For ATP and GTP, the initial binding configurations from the umbrella samplings overlap well with some stabilized population from the equilibrium ensemble, though deviations from the equilibrium ensemble show in the umbrella sampling case, indicating potentially the forcing impacts from the umbrella sampling simulations. For RDV-TP initial binding, the stable configuration of the RDV-TPtemplate in base stacking is well sampled, as the umbrella sampling path was launched from the base stacking configurations which leads to a low insertion barrier [48]. For the dATP\ninitial binding, the umbrella sampling simulation also well covers one stabilized population. Hence, the significantly stabilized configuration of GTP/dATP upon initial binding, detected from the umbrella sampling simulations, appears to be well located within a subspace in the equilibrium ensemble.\nSince the initially bound non-cognate dATP or GTP could not be well stabilized by association with the template +1 nt (nor 3\u2019 end primer), it must be interactions from the RdRp protein along with the RNA scaffold around the active site that strongly hold the non-cognate dATP or GTP, which we examine and elaborate below."

            "text": "sistent HB interactions from motif F/G/A, to NTP, template nt +1, or 3\u2019 end primer.\nThough there were noWC orWB base pairing interactions observed for non-cognate dATP/GTP with the template uracil upon initial binding toward the open active site, some populations of dATP/GTP are strongly stabilized upon the initial binding according to their insertion free energetics or PMFs (shown in Figure 3). To gain understanding of this phenomena, we analyzed all HB interactions present among protein residues, NTP, and RNA strands (template and primer), around the active site. Given the variations amongst NTPs, we simplified the analyses by summing up overall HB populations exceeding 20% of occupancy (during the umbrella simulation 40ns/window) amongst the protein (residues within 10 A\u030a of the active site center), template +1 nt, 3\u2019 end of the primer, and the initially bound NTP; those HBs were further grouped according to interactions with the NTP on polyphosphate, sugar, or base (see Figure 5). The cumulative HB measure is then calibrated over that of the cognate ATP.\nNotably, one finds that GTP initial binding is stabilized predominantly by HBs (and salt bridges in the case of positively charged residues LYS/ARG) formed between its polyphosphate group and the protein residues in motifs. In addition, the protein residues (motif F and G) stabilize particularly the template nt +1, due to the absence of WC or WB base pairing between the initially bound GTP and the template nt. Meanwhile, there is lack of protein HB association with the 3\u2019 end primer around the initially bound GTP. However, this association is present around the initially bound ATP or RDV-TP, and the association appears even stronger around the non-cognate dATP initially bound.\nIn the case of dATP initial binding, though it does not form WC base pairing with the template nt+1, the adenine base is nonetheless stabilized via protein HB (again from motifF). Intriguingly, despite dATP\u2019s lack of a 2\u2019 OH group, it still maintains a strong HB via the sugar of the 3\u2019 end primer. As mentioned above, the 3\u2019 end primer around the initially bound dATP displays the strongest HB interactions among all the NTP\u2019s with the protein. Below, we show the individual HB interactions structurally around GTP and dATP and compare them with those in the case of cognate RDV-TP or ATP binding, respectively (Figure 6 and Figure 7). One can find statistics of HBs formed between NTP (polyphosphate, sugar, or base) and protein residues or template nt +1/3\u2019 end primer, and between protein residues and template nt+1 or the 3\u2019 end primer in SI Figure S10. Notably, we have found that upon initial binding, GTP exhibits very strong HB or salt bridge interactions between motif-\nF K551/R553 (together with motif-A K621) and the polyphosphate (see Figure 6A). We attribute such interactions to hinder the insertion of GTP, or say, the phosphate-K551/R553 interactions contribute significantly to the barrier of GTP insertion. In the cognate initial binding, the ATP sugar forms a HB with motif-C D760. In contrast, GTP initial binding is mainly stabilized by HB between sugar and motif-A D623 (from umbrella sampling simulations). Instead of WB pairing with the non-cognate GTP upon initial binding, the template nt+1 base forms HBs with motif-F K545 and A558 (see Figure 6B). Furthermore, the template nt +1 backbone forms HB with motif-G K511, as opposed to motif-G S501 seen in the other NTP binding cases. Overall, the protein motifs F and G seem to well stabilize the template nt +1 upon the base mismatched GTP binding.\nIn the case of RDV-TP initial binding via base stacking with the template nt +1 (in the absence of force on the template nt), however, only one HB is observed on the polyphosphate from motif-F K551 (see Figure 6C), so that the RDV-TP won\u2019t be hindered by the phosphate interaction for its insertion [48]. In addition, the base stacking configuration of RDV-TP with the template allows for a unique HB to form between motif-B S682 and the RDV-TP base, while the template nt +1 has fewer HBs with motif-F than that upon GTP initial binding (Figure 6D).\nIn comparison, as from current umbrella sampling simulations, dATP upon initial binding forms a single HB with template nt +1 at a very high occupancy of 95%. In addition, a HB is uniquely established between the dATP base and motif-F T556 at an occupancy of 87% (Figure 7A). The dATP initial binding also forms two persistent HBs between the sugar and motif-C D760 and the 3\u2019 end primer, respectively. The template nt +1 is further stabilized by interactions with motif-F K545 and S501G, as seen with the cognate initial binding (Figure 7B). Importantly, 3\u2019 end primer forms the most persistent HBs with motif-F K545/R555 and motif-C S759 in the case of dATP initial binding.\nIn the case of ATP initial binding, its base is stabilized by forming variable WC base pairing. Note that the initially bound ATP formed two HBs with template nt +1, with occupancies of 50% and 44%, respectively. The ATP sugar forms a consistent single HB with motif-C D760. Stable associations also form between motif-F K551/R553/R555 and the ATP polyphosphate (Figure 7C). Such interactions were suggested to facilitate the cognate ATP insertion instead [48]. The template nt +1 forms stable HB with motif-F K545 and motif-G S501, similar to dATP initial binding. In addition, the 3\u2019 end primer forms only a single transient HB with motif-C S759 (Figure 7D), weaker than that is present between the 3\u2019 end and motif-C/F upon the dATP initial binding (Figure 7B)."

            "text": "In current work, we have focused on computationally probing from initial binding to the insertion and selectivity mechanisms of noncognate natural nucleotides to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The insertion step process involves subtle but still substantial conformational change of the RdRp pol domain (Figure 1), leading to essentially an active site open or nucleotide initial binding state to the active site closed or insertion state [31], with coordination of seven highly conserved structural motifs. In all NTP incorporation systems simulated, the fingers subdomain displays similar conformational flexibility as the palm subdomain, which moves closer to the finger\u2019s subdomain in the insertion state than in the initial NTP binding state (Figure S1). In the insertion state of cognate ATP or RDV-TP, motif-B and C have similar conformational flexibility (via RMSD) demonstrated in the equilibrium simulation, while this feature is absent in noncognate GTP and dATP (Figure S2). Overall, the motifs respond differently for each incoming NTP studied. The equilibrium ensemble simulations showed generically that the insertion state sampled a restricted subspace between the NTP and template nt +1 over that of the initial binding state, which indeed accommodates a wide range of configurations (Figure 2). Additionally, RNA template/primer nucleotides or protein residues around the active site forms more HBs with the NTP in the insertion state than in the initial binding state (Figure S4). Due to time scale limit of equilibrium sampling, we probed the NTP insertion dynamics and calculated the corresponding insertion energetics using the umbrella sampling methods. The energetic profile or insertion PMF was constructed along a collective RC according to a difference of RMSDs between the modeled intermediate structure of the RdRp and the open and closed reference states, respectively. The essential atomic coordinates included those of backbone atoms from seven highly conserved structural motifs (A to G), which are crucial for recruiting nucleotide substrates with selectivity and supporting catalysis [73], and heavy atoms on incoming NTP along with (or without) the template nt +1. While such a choice on enforcing on the template nt or not played some significant role in the PMF construction of cognate ATP and analogue RDV-TP (see Figure S10) [48], it made little difference in the non-cognate dATP or GTP results, e.g., as observed from the base pairing geometry measured between NTP and template nt +1 (Figure 4&S9). The insertion barriers were not affected much by the choices for dATP or GTP either (Figure S6). In contrast with the insertion PMFs of cognate ATP and RDVTP analogue that bias toward a more stabilized insertion state, we have found intriguingly that the initial binding states for ncNTPs (dATP and GTP currently) can be much more stabilized than their insertion state. In addition, the insertion barrier of ncNTP becomes very high (up to 7-10 kcal/mol), also in contrast with the marginally low insertion barriers of cognate ATP and RDV-TP (\u223c2 kcal/mol) identified previously [48]. Such free energetic calculations and structural dynamics examinations reveal intrinsic nucleotide selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, i.e., to inhibit the insertion of ncNTPs to the active site by trapping the ncNTPs off-path upon initial binding to the peripheral of the RdRp active site."

            "text": "insertion of non-cognate NTPs\nIn previous work [48], we calculated the insertion PMFs for ATP and RDV-TP, respectively. While the RDV-TP initial binding could form WC base pairing with the template nt+1, a more stabilized conformation was found for RDV-TP in base stacking with the template nt +1. Besides, the RDV-TP insertion barrier would become high (hins \u223c5 kcal/mol) when the enforcing in the umbrella sampling simulation included the template nt +1 (Figure S11A). The striking feature was due to the enhanced HB (or salt-bridge from positively charged LYS/ARG) interactions between the motif-F residues (K551/R553/R555) and the RDV-TP polyphosphate (Figure S11B), upon the enforcing on the template nt. Removing forcing on the template nt+1, i.e., allowing sufficient thermal fluctuations on the template, however, the motif-F interactions with the polyphosphate reduce, and the insertion barrier lowers to a marginal value (hins \u223c1.5 kcal/mol).\nUpon the cognate ATP binding, including the template nt +1 for enforcing in the umbrella sampling simulations nevertheless supports an insertion barrier hins as low as \u223c2.6 kcal/mol (Figure S11A). The well controlled template nt+1 facilitated WC base pairing and supported enhanced HB interactions between the motif-F K551/R555 and polyphosphate (Figure S11C). Consequently, it was suggested that the motif-F interactions with the phosphate facilitate insertion of the cognate ATP, while the motif F-phosphate interactions also appear to be important for NTP insertion in the PV RdRp [74]. Regardless of the exact protocol, the insertion state was always more stable than the initial binding state for the cognate ATP and analogue RDV-TP, both of which are actively biased or recruited into the closed active site for catalytic incorporation to the 3\u2019-end of primer, experiencing marginally high barriers of insertion to the active site [48].\nIn contrast, upon the initial binding of ncNTP (dATP or GTP), a large configuration space of the ncNTP with respect to the template+1 nt and 3\u2019-end primer was identified, and the PMF always tilts toward the initial binding state, i.e., biased or energetically stabilized upon initial binding of certain ncNTP configurations (Figure 3&S6). Additionally, the insertion barriers insertion become very large for noncognate GTP and dATP (hins \u223c7.0 and 9.6 kcal/mol, respectively). The stability bias toward the initial binding state and tremendously large barrier of insertion seem to trap the ncNTP upon initial binding at certain configurations (or the off-path), which would likely lead to dissociation of the ncNTPs from the active site or from the RdRp in the end.\nOur current discoveries on such stabilization of the non-cognate substrate upon initial binding may seem counterintuitive. Commonly, high binding affinity of a ligand substrate to the receptor protein indicates a preference of the receptor to the substrate [75,76]. Such an idea prevails in the drug design which aims at identifying high-affinity binders. In the current viral RdRp system, however, the NAC proceeds with two pre-chemical steps: substrate initial binding and insertion. As shown in current study, a high substrate binding affinity at the first step may also contribute to high insertion barrier for the second step, which slows down the NAC or an enzymatic cycle. Hence, the ncNTP stabilization or trapping upon initial binding becomes an intriguing but effective strategy to deter or inhibit the non-cognate substrate from further incorporation."

            "text": "ncNTP and its surroundings at the initial binding off-path state\nCurrent free energy calculations reveal that the noncognate GTP/dATP is more stabilized upon initial binding to the RdRp active site than in the insertion state, in contrast with cognate ATP/RDV-TP to be more stabilized in the insertion state. To explain notable stabilized configurations sampled for the ncNTP initial binding state from the umbrella sampling simulations, we identified a variety of HB interactions around the active binding site formed among NTP (base, sugar and phosphate), RNA strands (template and primer), and the conserved protein motifs (Figure 5). To well explain the trapping mechanism, we can also compare current system with a previously studied RdRp from Enterovirus or EV [31], which is structurally similar to SARS CoV-2 RdRp. In EV RdRp, NTP insertion to the active site is suggested via several steps: first the base recognition, next the ribose sugar recognition, and then followed by the active site open to closed conformational transition, accompanied by the palm subdomain (motifs A,B,C,D,E) closing. Below we connect current observations of NTP initial binding to those suggested steps.\nIn the case of GTP initial binding, the template nt +1 (uracil) fails to interact with the mismatch GTP in the absence of WC or WB base pairing. The template nt +1 and GTP cannot be mutually stabilized, hence the protein motif-F residues (K545/A558) respond by stabilizing the template base. Additionally, motif-G K511 forms HB with the template RNA backbone, instead of S501 in the ATP/RDV-TP system. Given the non-stabilized GTP base, the sugar is next checked by the protein via motif-A D623, which is prominent upon GTP initial binding (in the umbrella sampling ensemble). The D623 interaction brings motif-A closer to GTP and allows a unique HB (or salt bridge) from K621 to the polyphosphate. Substantial HBs (or salt bridges) with the polyphosphate come additionally from motif-F K551/R553, similarly as seen in RDV-TP (with force on template nt +1). In both cases of initial binding (GTP and RDV-TP with forcing on the template nt+1), the insertion barriers are high. Such observations support the previously proposed mechanism that the Lys/Arg interactions with phosphates inhibit the ncNTP insertion but facilitate cognate NTP insertion [48], or say, the protein-NTP phosphate interactions play a significant role in nucleotide selectivity or fidelity control. Recent NMR experiments on the structurally similar PV RdRp suggest that interactions from charged residues in motif-F are an important fidelity checkpoint, as they allow the triphosphate to rearrange prior to catalysis [77].\nIn the case of dATP binding, since dATP has the same base as the cognate ATP, it should be capable of forming stable WC base pairing with the template nt, but it does not. Additionally, dATP fails on the sugar recognition. The sugar is unable to anchor in the active site due to missing the 2\u2019 OH functional group. Instead, the 3\u2019 OH group forms HB with motif-C D760, similar to ATP and RDV-TP. Meanwhile, a unique HB forms between the dATP sugar and 3\u2019 end primer HB. As a result, dATP base adopts a tilted conformation, which supports only a single persistent HB w/ template nt +1 (Figure 7A). The dATP base is then further stabilized by motif-F T556. The missing WC base pairing between dATP and the template nt +1 in is supplemented by another HB formed between the dATP base and motif-F K545. Additional stabilization of dATP initial binding comes from the HB formed between the 3\u2019 end primer from motif-C S759, and the 3\u2019-end primer further forms HB with\ndATP sugar. The dATP sugar further forms HB with D760 from motif C. Hence, it appears that the 3\u2019-end primer plays an important role in stabilizing dATP with a network of HB interactions upon initial binding or say, off-path.\nAlthough the non-cognate dATP initial binding stability appears perplexing, prior crystal structure studies on the structurally similar PV RdRp have used dCTP to stall and resolve the RdRp structure in the open state [30], supporting a stable binding configuration of dNTP binding to the viral RdRp. In addition, experimental work on the nsp14 exonuclease enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 has shown that for excision of an incorrect nt, the nt needs to have a proper RNA sugar, 2\u2019 and 3\u2019 OH functional group [78], indicating that the enzyme may require some nucleotide selectivity to prevent dNTP\u2019s from chemical incorporation. Furthermore, recent experimental studies have shown that an elongation complex soaked in solution with dNTPs had no catalytic activity [79]. Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics also showed the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp selectivity of ATP over dATP is \u223c1000 (Vmax\nKm =0.02 in dATP and 23 in ATP) [80]. Similar\ntrends were observed in PV in vitro biochemical studies with \u223c117 discrimination factor ( kpol Km )CTP/( kpol Km\n)dCTP [81]. Other computational works also tested the design of inhibitors with ribose sugar modifications or removal of the OH function groups entirely [36,37]."

            "text": "To conclude, we have employed all-atom MD simulations and demonstrated intrinsic or natural nucleotide selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, in which the ncNTP is well stabilized or trapped upon initial binding to certain off-path configurations, as the highly conserved structural motifs F/G/A/C of the viral RdRp form HBs with ncNTP, RNA template nt, and/or 3\u2019-end RNA primer. Intrinsically, it is not the polymerase enzyme that determines a right/cognate or wrong/non-cognate nucleotide substrate in the template-based polymerization. The cognate or non-cognate NTP species are determined by the RNA template nt primarily via the WC base pairing, and additionally by the 3\u2019-end primer via base stacking etc. With incoming ncNTP that is incapable of stabilizing the template counterpart or the 3\u2019-end primer, the RdRp structural motifs sense such instability, and then takes over to select against the ncNTP. Presumably, ncNTP can be rejected in case of low binding affinity, i.e., upon initial binding to RdRp. However, it appears that in SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, the ncNTP can be particularly stabilized, say off-path, upon initial binding to certain configurations, so that to be prevented or inhibited from further insertion to the active site. Such mechanism of nucleotide selection seems to be well supported by the two-step binding and insertion processes, pre-chemically, in the single-subunit viral polymerase enzymes. Partial off-path initial binding and inhibition for insertion of ncNTPs were also suggested computationally for single-subunit T7 RNAP [51,82].\nTechnically, we have employed the umbrella sampling simulations to characterize the slow NTP insertion dynamics that is accompanied by the open to closed conformational changes around the RdRp active site. As the slow pre-chemical conformational transition likely takes place over milliseconds, it becomes indispensable to enhance computational sampling while limiting artifacts to be introduced. In the simulation, we well manipulated collective atomic coordinates from all structural motifs along with key players of NTP/template. Nevertheless, how to identify the most essential coordinates is a continuous challenging issue [83, 84].\nAdditionally, accelerated simulations [85] may be conducted to sample a sufficient amount of conformational transitions, i.e., from open to closed. For multiple NTP species incorporation, enhanced computational sampling would become even more demanding, considering that multiple reaction paths exist [86]. Further exploration and validation of our current studies would require substantial experimental studies. Resolving high-resolution structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complexes with the stabilized off-path initial binding configurations of non-cognate dATP or GTP, as being proposed in current computational work, would be highly anticipated."
