Due to the continuous changes in the production of mining factories, the cost control of mining personnel needs to consider the overall balance of different links, continuity, and uncertainty, in order to carry out effective identification and optimization, and control the cost of mining personnel of mine engineering. With the rapid development of science and technology, digitization and visualization technology have been widely used in various fields. As the main component of the mine, development plan for cost control of mining personnel is needed, digitizing and visualizing the mining activities, timely and accurately recording and expressing the engineering changes in the mine pit, and improving the mining level and work efficiency [1\u20133].\n)e construction of an integer model is used to optimize the location of fans in the network and the selection of structures in this paper.)e cost of ventilation is normalized to minimize it. For the same problem, the nonlinear unmixed model covers special constraints and branch\nconstraints, which are the basis for semiconstrained design, and optimizes the answer."

If the NURBS surface adopted cannot be correctly controlled, it cannot meet the need of explaining the lane. In addition, the complicated program leads to the low operation efficiency. In this study, an arched lane is made by adding a tangent plane.)e arched lane is composed of two concentric cylinders with different radii and two concentric circular plates. Projective transformation is an important graphics conversion technique\nwhose purpose is to define the view. )e extra part outside the field of view is intercepted, and the final image is only the relevant part of the visual field.\nIn perspective projection, the projection close to the point is very large, the projection from the viewpoint is very small, and the projection that reaches the extreme point disappears and becomes the vanishing point. )e projection is mainly used for meeting animation requests, visualization and other image display areas.

Due to the complexity of the system, it is difficult to use traditional methods to build accurate and complete prediction and control models.\n6.1.

Whenmining, the parameters of the mining process mainly include explosive unit consumption, row spacing, hole bottom distance, and collapse steps. Based on the theoretical and experimental research on the blastability evaluation of metal ore and the optimization of deep hole excavation parameters of the in-pit excavation sites, these parameters need to be considered in the optimal control model of production.\n6.2.1. Preliminary Determination of Explosive Unit Consumption. All test blast holes are artificially filled. According to relevant data and experience, the unit consumption q value of the funnel test explosive is taken as 3.25 kg/m3 and detonated at the bottom of the hole with an explosive tube detonator. After the explosive is filled, it will be severely blocked by taphole clay. After the blast hole is mined, the falling part of the laccolith around the funnel mouth is subtracted to determine the boundary of the funnel mouth. Take the blast hole as the center, take the radii r of nine funnels in different directions directly at 45\u00b0, use the average value as the radius r of the collecting funnel, to measure the actual minimum resistance cord w, and calculate the mining action index n.)e funnel test data based on test statistics and calculation benchmarks are shown in Table 4.\n)e average radius r of the mining funnel obtained from Table 4 is 0.88m, the average minimum resistance cord is 0.65m, and the actual mining action index n\ufffd r/w \ufffd 1.38. )e explosive consumption q value in actual standard unit is in turn calculated as 1.68 kg/m3 according to the formula of Polis Aube.\n)e number of columns in each unit consumption value experiment is all 10 columns, and the number of tests is four times. )e number of columns corresponding to each detonation is two columns, two columns, three columns, and three columns. )e detonation is delayed in milliseconds between the columns, and the time interval should not be less than 50ms. Table 5 shows the mining test results when different explosives are consumed separately.\nSynthesizing the analysis and summary of the mining effect of multiple experiments, the reasonable unit consumption range of the mining area is 0.82\u20130.88 km/m3, and the unit consumption value is set to 0.86 km/m3 in the mining design. )e actual unit consumption is controlled within the range of 0.82\u2013088 kg/m3.)e effect after mining is ideal, and the volume fraction is low (3%\u201325%).
