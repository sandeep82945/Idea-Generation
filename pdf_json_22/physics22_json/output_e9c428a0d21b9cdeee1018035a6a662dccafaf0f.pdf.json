It is causedby apartial or entire slope rapidly impacting certain water after the slope is unstable and destroyed [1], which causes great damage to the surrounding environment and the safety of human life and property [2]. There have been a lot of landslide surge disasters in history. In 1958, the maximum surge generated by the landslide in Lituya Bay, Alaska, reached 524 m high and made it the highest record in history [3,4]. In 1963, the Vajont reservoir in Italy was destroyed. A mass of nearly 300 million m3 of rock and debris fell into the reservoir and generated a wave that over-topped the 261.6 m high dam built across the gorge [5]. Approximately 2000 people were killed in the disaster [6]. In addition to the landslide surges that have occurred in history, many potential landslides may cause serious hazards.

Effective landslide surge disaster prediction research is very important. At present, the research on the landslide surge mainly covers three aspects: theoretical analysis [8], physical experiment [9], andnumerical simulation [10].Theoretical derivation methods usually simplify real conditions based on assumed models. Mulligan et al. [11] derived the analytical solution of the maximum height of the surges in the near field according to themomentumconservationof the landslide andwater. Physical experiments and numerical simulations are generally used for complex practical problems such as boundary conditions. The preliminary physical experiments are mainly based on twodimensional or semi-infinite space conditions. However, Heller et al. [12] pointed out that surges in two-dimensional conditions were overestimated and three-dimensional surges attenuated faster. In the later stage, a series of 3D simulation experiments were carried out. Panizzo et al. [13] derived the correlation index from the three-dimensional experiment, which can be well applied to the actual surges in the Vajont reservoir. Although physical experiments are of high reliability, the cost is high and the relevant physical information is difficult to obtain comprehensively [14]. Compared with physical tests, numerical simulation is more flexible and convenient to consider the effect of geological structure and water conditions on landslide surges in actual situations. At present, most of the numerical simulation methods of landslides are to simulate the movement of the discontinuous medium. Mainly including the Discrete Element Method (DEM) [14], the Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA) [15], and the Numerical Manifold Method (NMM) [16], etc., but these methods can not directly simulate the surges generated later. Considering the different mechanical properties of blocks and fluids, some scholars have coupled the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and discontinuous numerical methods [17], such as the coupled CFD-DEM Approach [18] and the hybrid DEM-SPH Model [19], etc. When solving partial differential equations (PDE), numerical methods such as the Finite DifferenceMethod (FDM) [20] and the Finite ElementMethod (FEM) [21] are mostly adopted. Most of these numerical methods need to be discretized when solving complex PDEs. This method directly correlates between the efficiency and accuracy of the calculation and the mesh density and the calculation step size, greatly limiting the solving process and results. The physics-informed neural network (PINN) was proposed by Raissi et al. [22]. It embeds PDEs such as principles of physical laws or other professional knowledge into neural networks to achieve accurate solutions for different types of PDEs by constraining the loss function. The rationality of the obtained solution is limited by embedding physical information,which helps the algorithm to performbetter learning optimization in the case of a small number of training samples. Besides, the calculation accuracy is independent of the calculation step size, so PINNs are expected to solve problems in traditional numerical methods, such as dimensional disasters, inverse problem solving, etc. At present, the application research of PINNs has made great progress in many fields. Kissas et al. [23] used PINN to determine unknown flow variables in a given arterial network and applied it to real clinical cases. Mao et al. [24] studied the possibility of using PINN to approximate the Euler equation of high-speed aerodynamic flow. Jin et al. [25] employed PINNs to solve some problems in incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In this paper, we preliminarily study the propagation of landslide surges using PINN.We simulate the surge propagation caused by a block falling into the water.We first construct\na rigid landslide surge model based on PINN. On this basis, we draw the morphological characteristics of the surge at different times and analyze the propagation process of the surge. Then we study the influence of the depth and particle density of water on the propagation respectively by controlling variables. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. \u201cMaterials andmethods\u201d sectionwill briefly introduce a rigid landslide surge model based on PINN and related theories. \u201cResults and analysis\u201d section will present the simulation results of the surge propagation process under different conditions and analyzes the influence of water depth and particle density. \u201cDiscussion\u201d section will discuss the applicability of PINN to the study of this type of problem and other methods that may be applicable.

            "text": "Fluid\u2013structure interaction knowledge is needed to study how the slide block interacts with the water. In this study, we mainly use empirical equations to describe this process. According to the study of Monaghan et al. [27], the water below the slide block can be approximated as horizontal motion during the falling process. We define the vertical falling velocity of the slide block at a certain moment as V, the horizontal velocity of the water under the slide block as U, and the distance between the bottom surface of the slide block and the bottom of the water tank as Y. According to the conservation of mass, the vertical falling velocity V and the horizontal velocity U relate as:\nV = UY / L (3)\nThe vertical velocity V of the slide block is:\nV \u221a gD = YD ( 1\u2212 YD )1/2 (D L )(2\u2212\u03b2)/2 ( M \u03c1LDW )1/2 (4)\nwhere \u03b2 is arbitrary. In this study, we take \u03b2 to be 1.\nModeling of landslide surge propagation using PINN The PINN learns by minimizing the sum of the squared errors. The sum square error equation of the neural network model is described as:\nL = MSEv +MSEdiv v +MSEp (5)\nMSEv = 1N N\u2211\ni=1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223vi+1 \u2212 vi \u2223\u2223\u2223 2\n(6)\nMSEdiv v = 1N N\u2211\ni=1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223div vi \u2223\u2223\u2223 2\n(7)\nMSEp = 1N N\u2211\ni=1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223pi+1 \u2212 pi \u2223\u2223\u2223 2\n(8)\nMSEv is the error between the velocity predicted by the neural network and the value controlled by the conservation of momentum. The conservation of mass is controlled by the square sum of the divergence of the velocity predicted by the neural network, as shown in Eq. (7).MSEp is the square sum of the error between the boundary pressure predicted by the neural network and the boundary pressure derived fromDirichlet boundary conditions. Dirichlet boundary is adopted as theboundaryof themodel, thewater surface is regarded as the free boundary, and the pressure at the boundary is zero. The side wall and bottom wall are regarded as fixed boundaries, and the velocity perpendicular to the boundary is zero. The initial condition is the static state when the bottom surface of the block is not in contact with the water. We use a fully connected neural network of 2 input neurons, 2 hidden layers with 60 neurons each, and 62 output neurons. The spatial coordinates (x, y) are fed into the neural network as input, where this model predicts the velocity and pressure as the output. A subset of liquid particles is used for training. We apply the tanh function as the activation function in the neural network. The L-BFGS-B optimizer provided by the SciPy package [28] is chosen to train 12,000 epochs for this experiment. In this paper, PINN is used to simulate the landslide surge propagation process as follows. First, the position information x and y of the initialized fluid particles are input into the fully connected neural network by predicting the output velocities vx and vy in the two directions. Then, the loss function is constructed based on the conservation of mass, the conservation of momentum, and boundary conditions. Finally, after continuous feedback adjustment to minimize the loss, the position and velocity of fluid particles are updated and input into the next time step. The flowchart of the PINN for the propagation process of landslide surge is given in Fig. 2. We illustrate the method for preliminarily studying the propagation of landslide surges with PINN by using a working flow chart, as shown in Fig. 3. We simulate the surge propagation caused by a slide block falling into the water. We first construct a landslide surge model based on PINN. On this basis, we draw the morphological characteristics of the surge at different times and analyze the propagation process of the surge. Then we study the influence of the depth and particle density of the water on the propagation respectively by controlling variables."

            "text": "Compared with the physical experiment in related literature, the simulation results are consistent with the physical experiment results, indicating that this study is reasonable and valid. Figure 4 shows the comparison between simulation results of landslide surge propagation process based on PINN and physical experiment results [27] (D=0.21 m, n=200/m).\nSimulation and analysis of the surge propagation process\nSimulation and analysis of the surgemorphology and pressure distribution First, we choose water depth D = 0.21 m and particle density n = 200/m as examples to analyze the propagation process of the surge. Under such conditions, themorphology and pressure changes of the surge at different times are shown in Fig. 5. At the initial contact with water, the surface of the water does not change significantly. Part of the water in contact with the block depresses slightly, and there is an area of significantly increased pressure in the deeper part of the water on the lower right of the block. As the block\ncontinues moving downward, part of the water beneath it is pushed to the right with the impact. The water next to the right of the block is lifted by compression. The surge begins to form gradually. Then, as more water is pushed to the right, the height of the wave gradually increases. At the same time, a small part of water enters the gap between the left side of the block and the wall with extrusion. The water on both sides of the bottom of the block is compressed and the pressure increases obviously. After that, the water on the right side overturns with the continuous impact of the water at the bottom of the block, forming a tip downward surge in the opposite direction of propagation. At this time, the internal cavity of the overturned water formed. Under the action of extrusion and impact, the height of the wave on the right side of the block increases continuously. The water in the gap on the left side of the block also rises until it exceeds the top of the block.\nSimulation and analysis of the surge flow and divergence In order to have a clearer understanding of how water flows during surge formation, we study the divergence of the water during the block falling into the water. Divergence describes the volume density of flux and the magnitude of velocity concentration and dispersion. Divergence greater than 0 means there is a net outflow of fluid. Divergence at different times when water depth D = 0.21 m is shown in Fig. 6. When the block just enters the water, the fluid beneath the block moves to the right under compression. As the block continues downward, most of the water to its right is lifted by the impact. At the same time, a small amount of water enters the gap between the slide block and the left wall and continues rising, which is consistent with the previous analysis based on the\nwave morphology and pressure. By drawing the divergence distribution diagram, we can understand the flow of water in each part during the formation of the surge more clearly and concretely.\nInfluence of water depth on characteristics of the surge Simulation results whenwater depth D = 0.116 m The depth of the water may affect the formation and propagation of the landslide surges. To study this effect, we only change the water depth for further analysis. Figure 7 shows morphology and pressure changes of the surge at different times when water depth D = 0.116 m and particle density n = 200/m.When the block is just in contact with the water, the reaction of water is similar to that ofD = 0.21 m. Part of the water in contact with the block depresses slightly, but the area with significantly increased pressure under the lower right part of the block is smaller in length and height than that shown in Fig. 8. Under the extrusion of the block, the water under the block is pushed into the right side. In the process of extrusion, the form of water intrusion is longer and narrower. As the block continues to move downward, the water on the right side also reverses under impact. Through comparison, it can be seen that when the water is shallower, the turnover degree of the water is larger and the cavity that forms in the water is smaller. After the collision\nwith the right wall, part of the watermoves upward along the wall, and the other part flows back to the block along the bottom of the tank. Similarly, during the movement, part of the water enters the gap between the block and the left wall and moves upward. But the water in the gap does not exceed the top of the block when the water is shallower.\nSimulation results whenwater depth D = 0.288 m When the water depth increases, the propagation process of the surge also changes to some extent. Figure 8 shows themorphology and pressure changes of the surge at different times when water depth D = 0.288 m and particle density n = 200/m. Compared with the simulation results of water depth D = 0.116 m and D = 0.21 m, the uplift amplitude and morphological changes of water surface are less obvious when the block begins to contact with water due to the large original depth of water. As the block falls into the water, most of the water at the bottommoves to the right under compression, and a small part of the water enters the gap between the block and the left wall and moves upward. The distribution of the area where the water pressure increases significantly under impact and extrusion is similar to the previous results. When the block moves to a certain extent, the water will also turn over, but its turning degree is lower than that when the water is shallower.\nInfluence of particle density on characteristics of the surge Simulation results when particle density n = 100/m Under the condition of the same water depth, different particle densities may also cause differences in surge shape and pressure distribution. Taking water depth D = 0.21 m as an example, we analyze the influence of particle density on the propagation process of the surge by changing the particle density. Figure 9 shows the morphology and pressure distribution of the surge at different times when particle density n = 100/m. Compared with Fig. 5, we can see that there are obvious differences in the form and propagation process of the surge. When the block is just in contact with water, the surface of the block has a certain depression. However, the area with high pressure on the lower right of the block is reduced. After the block falls into the water at a certain depth, although the water also moves to the right under the pressure, the uplift amplitude of the water surface is lower than that when particle density n=200/m. The shape change of the water surface on the right side is not obvious, and the height of particles rising in the left void also decreases.\nSimulation results when particle density n = 300/m Figure 10 shows the surge morphology and pressure distribution at different times when water depth D = 0.21 m and particle density n = 300/m. Compared with Fig. 5, the range and pressure values of the area with higher pressure under the lower right side of the block increase to some extent when the block just making contact with water. At a certain depth, most of the water moves to the right with impact. The uplift amplitude and morphology change of the water surface are similar to the simulation results when the particle density n = 200/m, but the volume of the internal cavity formed when the surge rolls over is smaller."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "In this paper, we use the PINN to simulate the propagation process of landslide surges. In previous studies, the research area of landslide surges can be roughly divided into the upstream, production area, and downstream. The waves are significantly different in different areas. The first surge occurs when the slide hits the water. When the width of the channel is within a certain range, with the first surge climbing and falling on the opposite bank, the secondary surges generate and spread in the generation area and the\ntransition boundary between the upstream and downstream areas. They aremuch smaller than the first surge and have a weak influence on the upstream and downstream areas. The generation area gradually becomes calm. The energy of the first surge is largely consumed in the climb to the opposite bank, but cannot be fully transmitted upstream and downstream. The surge height that can be transmitted upstream and downstream is significantly smaller than thefirstwaveheight generatedby landslide impact.The landslide position has an obvious influence on the damage of the surges [29]. PINNhasunique advantages in situations of limited trainingdata, clear initial conditions and boundary conditions, and known related physical laws. Compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, PINN can effectively make use of known physical laws, train models that automatically meet corresponding constraints, and predict important physical parameters of the model by solving inverse problems. Therefore, it is feasible to use PINN to simulate and analyze the movement of landslide surges. However, there are some limitations in using PINN to simulate landslide surges. Generally, PINN is designed according to specific problems. Under different engineering geological conditions, landslide surges may have great differences in morphology and pressure distribution during propagation, which results in that the landslide surge model constructed for a specific case cannot be directly extended to the study of more complex problems. In addition, the choice of network architecture in PINN often has a great influence on the accuracy of the results. In order to get better results, it is usually necessary to make repeated adjustments to get the right network architecture. Moreover, the operation process of PINN is relatively complex, and the training efficiency is greatly affected. Besides, the current PINN is aimed at solving PDE modeling problems. We don\u2019t know whether it can be extended to problems without PDE modeling. Therefore, the results of PINN require more specific analysis to further assess their validity. PINN is still in the preliminary stage and there are a lot of problems to solve. In addition to the PINN used in this paper, many other methods can be applied to the simulation and study of landslide surges and other engineering geological problems. Vacondio et al. [30] firstly applied a three-dimensional Smoothed ParticleHydrodynamics (SPH)model to the falling slidemovement and the wave simulation based on the landslide surges generated in Vajont. Rauter et al. [31] proposed a new three-dimensional particle landslide and tsunami model and applied it to some true cases. All these methods may be applied to the simulation and study of landslide surges. In the future, further discussion and analysis will be carried out to obtain more reasonable research results and provide new solutions for the analysis and prediction of geological conditions of large projects such as reservoirs and dams. The model used in this study still needs some improvement. For example, the model simplifies the landslide to a rigid slide block falling vertically, regardless of the viscosity and compressibility of water and the failure or disintegration process of rock and soil mass. In practical engineering problems, the existence of air will also affect the propagation process of landslide surges. These simplified operations make the model different from the actual situation in simulating landslide surge propagation. In the follow-up study, we will further consider the influence of various factors on the landslide surge propagation process to improve the model and optimize the simulation results."
