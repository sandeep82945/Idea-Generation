The compound Li3SiNO2:Eu 2+ was synthesized in high temperature solid-state reactions in weld shut tantalum ampules and the crystal structure of Li3SiNO2 has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. It crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c (no. 15) with the lattice parameters a = 1049.01(3), b = 1103.42(3), c = 511.86(2) pm, β = 116.14(1)°, and a volume of V = 0.53187(2) nm3. This compound is
built up from two different layers, which are arranged alternately along the crystallographic a-axis. The
results from single-crystal diffraction were confirmed by the Rietveld analysis of bulk samples. Moreover, Li3SiNO2 could be successfully doped with the activator ion Eu 2+ and the luminescence spectroscopy of single-crystals revealed broad band emission at λmax = 601 nm (fwhm = 90 nm). conclusion In this study, a new orange-emitting phosphor Li3SiNO2:Eu 2+ has been successfully prepared by a solid-state reaction in tantalum ampules. The compound can be excited effectively by near-UV to blue light and the single-crystals of Li3SiNO2:Eu 2+ exhibit an emission maximum at λmax = 601 nm with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 90 nm (0.32 eV, 2597 cm−1). The crystal structure with its 3D-network can be described as a condensed layered structure consisting of two different layers A and B, which arrange alternately along the crystallographic a-axis. Although layer A has structural similarities to other compounds such as Na2Mn2S3 and Na6In2S6 and zweier single chains can basically also be found in phosphors such as MSi2O2N2 (M = Sr, Ba, Eu),
26,59–73 the structural motif and connection pattern in layer B are still unknown. The latter consists of pure Li+ cations, which build up a dense network of cornerand edge-shared tetrahedra and octahedra with the O2− and N3− anions. Furthermore, we discussed four possible positions in the structure hosting the activator ion Eu2+, which include two different octahedral coordination spheres, one octahedral void spanned by a special arrangement of different polyhedra and a tetrahedrally coordinated Li-channel. In comparison with other compounds known from the literature such as α- and β-SiALON,74–76 we see that heavy cations are not necessarily required as counterions in the structure that can be substituted by the activator ion Eu2+ resulting in interesting luminescence properties. Experimental section and theoretical methods synthesis Since it is crucial to maintain control over the amount of oxygen for synthesizing oxonitrides, all preparations were
carried out using an inert gas (Ar 5.0, Messer Austria GmbH) filled glovebox (MBraun, O2 < 1 ppm, H2O < 1 ppm). The starting materials Si3N4 (UBE SN-E10, >99%) and Li2O (Sigma Aldrich, >97%) with a stoichiometric ratio of 1 : 4 were weighed and mixed with 5 wt% LiF (Sigma Aldrich, >99.99%) as a flux and 2mol% EuF2 (Alfa Aesar, >99.9%) using an agate mortar. Afterwards, the powder mixture was filled into a tantalum ampule and sealed via arc welding under an argon atmosphere. The reaction vessel was then placed inside a silicaglass ampule containing a 400 mbar inert gas atmosphere (Ar 5.0, Messer Austria GmbH). The temperature profile of the synthesis consists of a heating ramp with 4 °C min−1 up to 960 °C, a dwelling time of 4 h, and subsequently a cooling ramp of −0.3 °C min−1 to 300 °C. Once cooled down to room temperature, the ampules could be opened and the samples were further examined under atmospheric conditions without detectable decomposition within several months. The product shows intense yellow to orange luminescence under UV-light (see Fig. 10). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
Under a polarization microscope, suitable single-crystals of Li3SiNO2 were isolated and subsequently investigated with a Bruker D8 Quest diffractometer (Mo-Kα radiation, λ = 0.7107 Å) equipped with a Photon 300 CMOS detector. The programs Saint77 and Sadabs78 were used for data processing and multiscan absorption correction. For the structure solution and parameter refinement, ShelXS79 using Direct Methods and ShelXL80 using the least squares method, both implemented in the program WinGX,81 were applied. The structural data were standardized employing Structure Tidy82 as implemented in Platon (version 170613).83 Further details on the crystal structure investigation of the single-crystal of Li3SiNO2 can be obtained from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures/under the deposition number 2208257.†
Powder X-ray diffraction
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), equipped with a STOE Stadi P powder diffractometer with Ge(111)-monochromatized Mo-Kα1 (λ = 70.93 pm) radiation and a Mythen 1K detector operated in Debye–Scherrer geometry across a 2θ range of 2°–40°, was used for phase analysis. The experimental powder pattern was compared with the calculated powder pattern derived from the single-crystal data of Li3SiNO2. The secondary phase identification was carried out with the ICDD PDF-2 database and the program Topas 4.284 was applied for Rietveld refinements. luminescence The emission spectra of representatives from Li3SiNO2 were recorded by a setup of a blue laser diode (λ = 448 nm, THORLABS, Newton, NJ, USA) in combination with a CCD detector (AVA AvaSpec 2048, AVANTES, Apeldoorn, The Netherlands). A tungsten–halogen calibration lamp was used for the previous spectral radiance calibration of the setup. The software AVA AvaSoft (version 7) was used for the data prepa-

The emission spectrum was recorded in the wavelength range between 470 and 750 nm (step size 1 nm) using an excitation wavelength of 400 nm. The same method was used to record the excitation spectra monitored at the corresponding maximum intensity and for the thermalquenching analysis. author contributions All the authors have accepted responsibility for the entire content of this submitted manuscript and approved submission. conflicts of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest regarding this article.
