However, such modulation induces heating which can overwhelm the signal of quantum dynamics in ultracold atoms. Here we report that the thermal motion, instead of being a noise source, provides a new control knob in Floquet-modulated superradiance lattices, which are momentum-space tight-binding lattices of collectively excited states of atoms. The Doppler shifts combined with Floquet modulation provide effective forces along arbitrary directions in a lattice in frequency and momentum dimensions. Dynamic localization, dynamic delocalization and chiral edge currents can be simultaneously observed from a single transport spectrum of superradiance lattices in thermal atoms. Our work paves a way for simulating Floquet topological matters in room-temperature atoms and facilitates their applications in photonic devices.\nCollective interaction between atoms and light plays an important role in quantum optics [1, 2]. A most famous example is the Dicke superradiance featured by enhanced decay rates of collectively excited atoms [3], in particular for atoms confined in a small volume compared with the light wavelength. In the opposite limit, i.e., when the size of the atomic cloud is much larger than the light wavelength, Scully et al. [4, 5] found that the light momentum can be stored in atoms prepared in the so-called timed Dicke states (TDSs) [6\u20138]. The stored momentum can be released in the directional superradiant emission [4]. More interestingly, such TDSs with different momenta can be coupled by multiple lasers to form momentumspace superradiance lattices (SLs) [9, 10], which provide a new platform for quantum simulation.\nIn contrast to real-space optical lattices that require ultracold temperature, SLs can be implemented in both cold atoms [11\u201313] and room-temperature atoms [14\u201316], since TDSs are robust to the center-of-mass motion of atoms [17\u201320]. Such a robustness can be understood from a distinct feature of the momentum-space SL, i.e., its Brillouin zone (BZ) is in real space. Here the positions of atoms play the same role of the crystal momenta of electrons in solids. Atoms moving through the real-space BZs follow the same dynamics of electrons in a DC electric field. Therefore, the atomic motion, instead of being a source of noise, can simulate an effective electric field in momentum space, which has been used to measure the geometric Zak phase [16, 21, 22].\nHere we show that SLs can also be used to study the rich physics in Floquet (temporally periodic) systems [23\u201327], where the thermal motion induced DC field significantly enriches the tunability. Being a widelyused technique in quantum engineering [28\u201339], Floquet\ndriving [40\u201343] can extend the 1D SLs into (1+1)D (momentum-frequency dimensional) lattices, allowing us to simulate higher-dimensional lattice dynamics [44\u201347]. In the (1+1)D SLs, there is a constant effective electric field in the frequency dimension, determined by the Floquet modulation frequency [48]. On the other hand, the atomic velocity provides a DC field along the momentum dimension with a strength proportional to the Doppler shift. By resolving the direction of the total field with a spectroscopic method, we observe dynamic localization, dynamic delocalization and chiral edge currents [49\u201366] in SLs of thermal atoms.\nExperimental setup and theoretical model. The experiment is implemented in a vapor cell of natural abundance rubidium atoms in a standing-wave-coupled electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) configuration (see Fig. 1(a)). A weak probe field couples the ground state |g\u3009 \u2261 |52S1/2, F = 1\u3009 to an excited state |b\u3009 \u2261 |52P1/2, F = 2\u3009 in 87Rb D1 line. The excited state is resonantly coupled to a metastable state |a\u3009 \u2261 |52S1/2, F = 2\u3009 by two strong laser fields. The probe field pumps the atoms to the TDS,\n|bkp\u3009 = 1\u221a N N\u2211 j=1 eikp\u00b7rj |g1...bj ...gN \u3009, (1)\nwhere kp is the wavevector of the probe field, rj is the position of the jth atom. The standing-wave coupling fields couple |bkp\u3009 to other TDSs with discrete momenta to form SLs [9], in which the directional superradiant emission from the TDS |b\u2212kp\u3009 is collected along \u2212kp direction [4\u20138], such that the lattice transport from |bkp\u3009 to |b\u2212kp\u3009 can be investigated. We can tune the probe frequency to measure the transport at different energies,\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n04 89\n8v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .q\nua nt\n-g as\n] 9\nD ec\n2 02\n2\n2 (b)\n0 1\u22121\ndriven 1D lattice static (1+1)D lattice\n\u03a9ei\u03b8+\u03a9ei\u03b8\u2212\nmomentum dimension\n(a)\nEOM\nEOM\n87Rb cell x\nprobe\nmomentum dimension 0 1\u22121\n\u22121\n0\nfr eq\nue nc\ny di\nm en\nsi on 1\nF1 F F2\nF1\ndetect\ndimension extension\na\nb\ng\n\u03a9ei\u03b8\u2212\n\u03a9ei\u03b8+\nphase modulation \u03b8\u00b1 = f sin(\u03b42t \u00b1 \u03d5/2)\n\u03b41 \u03b41\nDoppler \u03b41 \u2248 \u2212 kcvx \u2248 \u2212 kpvx\nprobedetect\nJ0 J\u22121ei\u03d5/2\nJ1ei\u03d5/2\nFigure 1.

The probed and detected sites are marked schematically.\nsimilar to tuning the Fermi energy of electrons in solids. In our experiment on 1D SLs, the probe field propa-\ngates in +x direction with a wave vector kp, parallel to the two coupling laser fields with wave vectors \u00b1kc and kp \u2248 kc. The phases of the coupling fields are modulated by two electric-optic modulators (EOMs) independently, \u03b8\u00b1(t) = f sin(\u03b42t\u00b1\u03c6/2), where f and \u03b42 are the modulation depth and frequency, and \u03c6 controls the phase delay between the two radio-frequency (RF) driving fields. The interaction between the atoms and the coupling fields is described by a Floquet SL (see Fig. 1(b)). The EOMs introduce periodic modulation of the coupling strengths in the SL Hamiltonian (we set ~ = 1 and see details in [67]),\nHd = \u2211 j \u2126a\u20202j [e \u2212i\u03b8+(t)b2j+1 + e \u2212i\u03b8\u2212(t)b2j\u22121] +H.c., (2)\nwhere \u2126 is the Rabi frequency of the coupling fields, a\u20202j and b \u2020 2j+1 are creation operators in the jth unit cell\nof the SL, a\u20202j \u2261 1/ \u221a N \u2211 l e\n2ijkcxl |al\u3009\u3008gl| and b\u20202j+1 \u2261 1/ \u221a N \u2211 l e i(2j+1)kcxl |bl\u3009\u3008gl| with xl being the position of the lth atom and N the total number of atoms. They create TDSs from the ground state, e.g., a\u20202j |g1, g2, ..., gN \u3009 = 1/ \u221a N \u2211 l exp(2ijkcxl)|g1...al...gN \u3009, which carries a momentum 2jkc. Using the Floquet theorem for Hd, we obtain an effective (1+1)D Hamiltonian V2 + Hs [67], including a potential energy in the frequency dimension [75],\nV2 = \u2212\u03b42 \u2211 j,m m(a\u20202j,ma2j,m + b \u2020 2j+1,mb2j+1,m), (3)\nand the static lattice Hamiltonian Hs = \u2211 nH [n] s with\nH [n]s = \u2211 j,m \u2126ein\u03c6/2a\u20202j,m[J\u2212n(f)b2j+1,m+n\n+ Jn(f)b2j\u22121,m\u2212n] +H.c.,\n(4)\nwhich couples lattice sites along the crystal direction e\u03021 + ne\u03022 (denoted by Miller index [1, n]) with e\u03021 and e\u03022 being the unit vectors along the momentum and frequency dimensions. Here Jn is the nth order Bessel function and d\u2020j,m (d = a, b) is the creation operator for |dj,m\u3009 \u2261 e\u2212im\u03b42t|dj\u3009 [43, 67]. We can understand |dj,m\u3009 as a replica of |dj\u3009 that carries \u2212m\u03b42 energy from the periodic driving [76]. The nth order hopping coefficient carries a phase \u00b1n\u03c6/2, which can synthesize a gauge field in the lattice (see Fig. 1 (b)). The linear potential along the frequency dimension V2 can be characterized by a force F2 = \u03b42e\u03022. Throughout the experiment we set \u03b42 = 80 MHz and \u2126 = 25 MHz to guarantee that the driving frequency is much larger than hopping strengths.\nFor moving atoms, the photons in the two coupling fields along \u00b1x directions have extra energies due to the Doppler shifts \u00b1\u03b41 with \u03b41 = \u2212kcvx and vx being the atomic velocity in x direction. Since the TDSs in the SL are created by absorbing and emitting photons in the coupling fields, the SL acquires a linear potential along the momentum dimension (in the lab reference frame),\nV1 = \u2212\u03b41 \u2211 j,m [2ja\u20202j,ma2j,m+(2j+1)b \u2020 2j+1,mb2j+1,m], (5)\nwhich has the effect of a force F1 = \u03b41e\u03021. Consequently, the force associated to the total linear potential V1 + V2 is F = F1 + F2 = \u03b41e\u03021 + \u03b42e\u03022. In our experiment, the hopping of excitations along the force direction is inhibited because the potential difference is much larger than the coupling strengths.\nLattice transport measurement. We can tune the probe frequency to measure the transport in SLs with different values of F . The interaction Hamiltonian between the probe field and the atoms is Hp = \u221a N\u2126pe\n\u2212i\u2206ptb\u20201,0 + H.c., where \u2206p = \u03bdp \u2212 \u03c9bg with \u03bdp being the probe field frequency and \u03c9bg being the atomic transition frequency\n3\ndafadf\nin the lab reference frame. The probe field couples the ground state to a TDS |b1,0\u3009, which has a potential energy \u2212\u03b41 proportional to the atomic velocity, such that we need to detune the probe field \u2206p \u2248 \u2212\u03b41 to excite the TDSs of atoms with the corresponding velocities. Since F1 is also proportional to the atomic velocity, we can measure lattice dynamics with different F1 at the corresponding probe detunings. In another word, with the probe detuning \u2206p, we measure the transport from |b1,0\u3009 to |b\u22121,m\u3009 in an effective force F = \u2212\u2206pe\u03021 + \u03b42e\u03022. Such transport is experimentally measured from the superradiant directional emission of |b\u22121,m\u3009 along the \u2212x direction, which satisfies the phase-matching condition \u22122kc + kp \u2248 \u2212kp [67]. Therefore, we can simultaneously measure the dynamics with different effective forces in a single transport spectrum by detuning the probe field frequency. The coherent probe field may also create more than one excitations which, however, have the same dynamic response as the TDSs due to the bosonic nature of atomic excitations in a weak probe field [9, 14].\nWe show a typical spectrum for the transport from |b1,0\u3009 to |b\u22121,m\u3009 in Fig. 2. Due to the Stark localization, the transport is only significant when the two states have the same potential energy, i.e., when the force points in a direction perpendicular to a crystal direction of the (1+1)D SL. As a result, the reflection is featured by discrete peaks at \u2206p = n\u03b42. The reflection peak at \u2206p = n\u03b42 is contributed by the transport from |b1, 0\u3009 to |b\u22121,\u22122n\u3009 along the crystal direction [1, n] (dotted lines in\nf 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(a) (b)\n\u0394p /\u03b42\nR 0\nno rm\nal iz\ned R\n(n\u03b4 2)\n0.2\n0\n3\n2\n1\nn = 4\nf 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 2 4\u22122\u22124 \u22123 1 3\u22121\nBessel zeros\nStark loc.\ndyn. deloc.\ndyn. loc.\nFigure 3.

(b) The relfections at \u2206p = n\u03b42 characterizing transport along crystal directions [1, n] (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are measured as functions of f , where the transport is completely inhibited at the zero points (marked by black arrow) of Jn(f). We set the phase delay \u03c6 = \u03c0.\nthe insets), perpendicular to F . From the reflection spectra we are able to investigate the dynamic localization and delocalization by simultaneously tuning the modulation depths of the two EOMs while keep their phase delay \u03c6 = \u03c0 fixed. We can also tune \u03c6 to introduce effective magnetic fluxes in the (1+1)D SLs to investigate the Floquet chiral edge currents.\nDynamic localization and delocalization. We measure the reflection spectra as a function of the probe detuning \u2206p and the modulation depth f (see Fig. 3(a)). The transport along the crystal direction [1, n] is demonstrated near the detuning \u2206p = n\u03b42 and governed by the interaction Hamiltonian H [n]s in Eq. (4). Remarkably, the transport is totally inhibited when the modulation depth f reaches to the zeros of the corresponding Bessel functions Jn(f) (marked by black arrows in Fig. 3(b)), where the effective hopping strength is zero in H [n]s . In particular, at the detuning \u2206p = 0, the reflectivity vanishes at f = 2.4, 5.5, and 8.7, which are the first three zeros of J0(f), characterizing the dynamic localization [49, 50]. For parameters in our experiment, localization at zeros of Jn(f) can be clearly identified up to |n| = 4, a significant improvement compared with other platforms [51, 52]. The order n is limited by the width of the Doppler broadening, which has a FWHM of 500 MHz at the experiment temperature 60\u25e6C.\nThe measured transport can be understood as the interplay between the lattice dynamics in AC and DC field [49\u201351, 53\u201360] in a 1D SL. The oscillating phases \u03b8\u00b1(t) introduce a uniform AC field (\u2202\u03b8\u2212/\u2202t \u2212 \u2202\u03b8+/\u2202t)/2 = f\u03b42 sin(\u03b42t) [43].

Floquet chiral currents. (a) The schematics of the effective Hamiltonian along a composite dimension of momentum and frequency. The NNN hoppings (green lines with arrows indicating the transition directions attached with a phase \u03c0/2) along crystal direction [1, n] (n = 0, 1, 2) are induced by all possible second-order transition paths (insets). (b) The zigzag chiral ladder along [1, n] (replotted from the reduced 1D lattices in (a)) with an effective magnetic flux \u03a6n in a unit loop.

The green arrows denote the transition directions attached with a phase \u03c0/2. (c) Phase diagram of \u03a6n as functions of \u03c6 and f . (d) The phase diagram of chiral currents measured by \u03b4Rn \u2261 R(n\u03b41)\u2212R\u2032(\u2212n\u03b41), which are consistent with the corresponding phase diagram of \u03a6n with phase boundaries indicated by solid lines.\nFig. 3(a). Without AC and DC fields, i.e., for \u03b41 = f = 0 near \u2206p = 0, the 1D SL transport signal is strong from |b1\u3009 to |b\u22121\u3009. When we keep f = 0 and detuning \u2206p away from zero, the signal disappears due to Stark localization in a DC field (see the blue point at \u2206p = \u03b42/2 and f = 0). When we keep \u2206p = 0 and increase f , an effective AC field leads to the dynamic localization at f = 2.4 [49, 50, 53\u201356]. With both AC and DC fields, the transport is recovered when the modulation frequency of the AC field is on resonance with the Bloch frequency of the DC field (see the green dot for \u2206p = \u03b42), which is called dynamic delocalization or photon-assisted tunnelling [51, 57\u201360].\nPhase diagram of chiral currents. Chiral edge currents have been observed in zigzag SLs [14]. Floquet engineering can bring new control knobs to induce such unidirectional transport [61\u201366]. Near \u2206p = n\u03b42, the Hamiltonian H [n]s introduces equipotential transitions while H [m] s \u2019s with m 6= n provide second-order transitions via intermediate states (see green lines in Fig. 4(a) and derivation in [67]),\nK [n] = \u2211 j,m i\u03ban(b \u2020 2j\u22121,m\u2212nb2j+1,m+n\n\u2212 a\u20202j,ma2j+2,m\u22122n) +H.c., (6)\nwith \u03ban = \u2212 \u2211\u221e p=1 2 sin(p\u03c6)\u2126\n2Jp+n(f)Jp\u2212n(f)/p\u03b42 [67]. When \u03c6 = \u03c0, we obtain \u03ban = 0 for dynamic localization and delocalization. In general, for \u03c6 6= 0 and \u03c0, H [n]s and K [n] induce the nearest-neighbor and next-nearestneighbor (NNN) hoppings (see red lines and green arrows in Fig. 4(a) and (b)). The phase factors in K [n] bring a magnetic flux in a unit closed loop (circular arrows in Fig. 4(b)) [14, 77],\n\u03a6n = \u03c0\n2 (\u22121)nsgn[\u03ban], (7)\nwhich depends on both f and \u03c6 and exhibits rich structures along different crystal directions (see Fig. 4(c)).\nThe direction of the synthesized magnetic field, i.e., the sign of \u03a6n, determines the unidirectional transport along b-sublattice, regardless of the strength \u03ban [14]. The chiral current flows to the right and left for \u03a6n = \u03c0/2 and\u2212\u03c0/2, which results in asymmetric distribution of steady-state probabilities in the SL with respect to the probed site. Such an asymmetry can be measured by comparing the reflection signals of two probe fields [14, 78] in opposite directions and with opposite detunings. We define R and R\u2032 as the reflectivities of the probe field incident along +x and \u2212x directions. R(n\u03b42) characterizes the transport from the site |b1,0\u3009 to |b\u22121,\u22122n\u3009 while R\u2032(\u2212n\u03b42) describes the transport from the site |b\u22121,0\u3009 to |b1,2n\u3009 [67].\n5 The chiral current along the crystal direction [1, n] are measured by \u03b4Rn \u2261 R(n\u03b42) \u2212 R\u2032(\u2212n\u03b42) (see Fig. 4(d)), which agrees with the phase diagrams in Fig. 4(c).\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that the SL provides a highly tunable platform to study the Floquet dynamics in thermal atoms. We simultaneously observe dynamic localization and delocalization from a single transport spectrum. We also experimentally measure the phase diagrams of chiral edge currents in a (1+1)D lattice with both artificial magnetic fluxes and electric fields. We can increase hopping strengths between TDSs to overwhelm the linear potentials, such that the motion of excitations is governed by the underlying 2D Bloch bands with the effective electric force being a perturbation. In such a regime topological non-equilibrium phenomena such as quantized energy pumping [37, 38, 44\u201347] and space-time crystals [76, 79\u201382] can be investigated. Furthermore, we can introduce interaction in SLs by using additional lasers to couple atoms to the Rydberg states [83] to realize many-body phenomena beyond the short-range interaction [67], such as the interplay between long-range nonlocal interaction and dynamic localization-delocalization transition [84, 85].\nWe thank Luqi Yuan for insightful suggestions.
