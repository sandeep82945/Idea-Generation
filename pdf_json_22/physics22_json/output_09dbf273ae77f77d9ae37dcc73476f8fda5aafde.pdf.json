The E\u00d7B drift far exceeds the diamagnetic drift so\nthat the sheared drift drives lower hybrid waves localized to the magnetic field reversal\nregion, which is ideally suited for the anomalous dissipation necessary for reconnection. It\nalso reveals substructures embedded in the current density, indicating a compressed current\nsheet.\nDOI:\nCurrent sheets are important to space and laboratory\nplasmas [1\u20136], and particularly to the Earth\u2019s magnetotail.\nA consequential but overlooked feature of thin current\nsheets is a transverse ambipolar electric field which is self-\nconsistently generated as the magnetotail is compressed by\nthe solar wind. [7] This interaction of large and small-scale\nphysics may consist of turbulent processes forming\nplasmoids and flux ropes, etc. [8,9] with kinetic-scale\ncurrent sheets between them that can reorganize the\nmacroscopic magnetic topology through reconnection and\naffect the magnetospheric plasma environment, also\nknown as \u201cspace weather\u201d. In situ measurements have\nshown compression of the magnetotail creates thin current\nsheets of widths comparable to the ion gyro-radius (\u03c1i), occasionally with single [10\u201312] or double peaked [13\u201317]\nsubstructures embedded in the current density. These thin\nstructured current sheets cannot be explained by the\nstandard Harris equilibrium [18], which is commonly used\nas an ideal current sheet representation [6]. Intense lower\nhybrid (LH) wave activity and subsequent magnetic\nreconnection with large scale topological changes is also\nobserved, which may result in a plasma dipolarization front\naccelerating towards Earth, injecting energetic particles\ninto the radiation belts [19\u201324], followed by a\nredistribution of mass, energy, and momentum throughout\nthe magnetosphere [6,7,16,25\u201328] which impacts Earth\norbiting satellites. It is therefore critical to understand the\nphysics of thin structured current sheets, especially the\nkinetic structures within, and the associated dynamics. The\nformation of the ambipolar electric field in thin current\nsheets at the smallest scale can affect particle orbits and\nprovides a new mechanism to generate intense electrostatic\nturbulence near the magnetic field reversal, resulting in\nanomalous dissipation processes that can initiate magnetic\nreconnection.\nTheoretical [7,29,30] and laboratory [31\u201333] studies\nhave shown that velocity-shear can intensify due to the\nambipolar electric field generated by plasma compression,\ndriving broadband turbulence peaking at the LH\nfrequency. Shear-driven LH waves dominate over the LH\ndrift (LHD) instability at the center of the current sheet\nwhere the density is nearly flat [34] and the shear\nfrequency, defined as the spatial derivative of the ?\u20d1? \u00d7 ?\u20d1? flow, exceeds the diamagnetic drift frequency. [7,35,36]\nIdentification of shear-driven LH waves in in situ data is\nnot only evidence of a thin structured current sheet, but\nalso emphasizes the importance of the ambipolar electric\nfield [7], the scope of which has not been explored in\nprevious magnetotail investigations [37\u201342]. As the scale\nsize of the current sheet becomes comparable to \u03c1i, the electric field intensifies making the velocity-shear strong,\nwhich can explain many observed features and their\ncausality, such as non-gyrotropic\ndistributions [7,16,28,43,44], plasma heating and\ncooling [7,27,41], vortex structures [7,20,35,45,46], and\nthe wide bandwidth of spectral signatures [7,32]. The\nability of the ambipolar electric field to break gyrotropy is\nan indicator of its major role in reconnection [47\u201349]. This\nletter presents the first evidence of shear-driven LH waves\nresulting from global compression that demonstrates the\nsignificance of transverse ambipolar electric fields in thin\ncurrent sheets that can occur prior to reconnection.\nThe four Magnetospheric Multi-Scale (MMS)\nspacecraft [50] traversed a current sheet (an approximate\n1D plasma structure near a magnetic reversal) in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetotail on July 3, 2017 and crossed the null\npoint at approximately 5:27:07.02 UTC. Rotating the\nvector data into a frame normal to the current sheet (LMN\n2 DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A. Approved for public release. Distribution is unlimited.\ncoordinates) allows for the analysis below, which suggests\nthat an ambipolar electric field forms due to compression\nof the current sheet, with an ?\u20d1? \u00d7 ?\u20d1? shear flow associated with LH fluctuations. The density gradient is small in this\nregion, suggesting that the shear flow provides the energy\nfor the fluctuations.\nDuring this event, the MMS spacecraft are in the night-\nside of Earth\u2019s plasma sheet on the dusk side of midnight\nfar from the magnetopause. Using the magnetic field\nmeasurements between 6 and 8 seconds, minimum\nvariance analysis (MVA) [54,55] is used to calculate the\neigenvector corresponding to a direction normal (?\u0302?) to the current sheet. The angular difference between the averaged\neigenvector and the eigenvectors calculated individually from each spacecraft (cos\u22121(?\u0302?\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc54 \u22c5 ?\u0302?\ud835\udc56)) is small (<4\u00b0), which is a good indicator that the magnetic field gradient\nis much stronger in ?\u0302? compared to other directions.\nAdditionally, a guide for judging the quality of the MVA\nis a large ratio of the eigenvalues corresponding to the ?\u0302? and ?\u0302? directions, (\u03bb\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc41\u2044 =12) indicating a well-defined ?\u0302? direction [52]. The resulting transformation matrix from\nGSE coordinates is [L,M,N] = [[-0.67,-0.68,-0.30], [-\n0.70,0.71,-0.04], [-0.24,-0.18,0.95]]. The vector data\npresented henceforth are rotated into LMN coordinates\nusing the transformation matrix in order to better infer\nmeasurements with respect to the orientation of the current\nsheet such that ?\u0302? is normal to the current sheet, ?\u0302? is in the\ndirection whose magnetic component reverses sign, and ?\u0302? is the direction of the guide magnetic field.\nA summary of the MMS1 data for a 5 s time span during\nthe current sheet crossing is shown in Fig. 1. Data from\neach spacecraft are comparable with similar features, so\nonly MMS1 data are shown. A boxcar averaging low pass\nfilter routine is applied to the time series measurements to\nimprove the signal to noise ratio and smooth the data to\ninfer quasi-static profiles. The top axis displays time\nconverted to distance and normalized to a representative \u03c1i (calculated from the average of the total magnetic field and\nion temperature between 7 and 8 s) to show how features\ncompare to ion-scale sizes. To convert time to distance, we\nuse the fact that the current sheet is sweeping by in ?\u0302? much faster than the spacecraft are moving (VMMS = 1.47 km/s). The magnetic field data from each spacecraft are shifted in\ntime to align the BL reversals. With the timing information and the spacecraft locations relative to each other, the\ncurrent sheet velocity can be estimated as Vcs = 223.1 \u00b1 57.5 km/s ?\u0302?. The time (x-axis) is then multiplied by Vcs to convert to distance, and then normalized to \u03c1i.\nThe magnetic field LMN components in Fig. 1(a) show\nthat by rotating the data into a frame normal to the current\nsheet, BN is near-zero with a BL reversal at 7.02 s (dashed, vertical line), which indicates the current sheet crossing.\nThe measured quantities are not symmetric about the BL reversal. There is a guide field (BM) of approximately 10 nT at the time of BL reversal. Using the average total magnetic field between 7 and 8 s (magenta box), \u03c1i = 841 km and \u03c1e = 6.9 km (electron gyro-radius). The ion velocity [Fig. 1(b)] is significantly smaller than the electron\nvelocity [Fig. 1(c)], indicating that the ions experience\nnegligible electric field due to gyro averaging as the\nelectric field scale size is less than \u03c1i [7]. The total electron\nflow velocity, VeL, has a scale size less than \u03c1i. The electric field components are shown in Fig. 1(d), where EL and EM are both small compared to EN (ambipolar electric field normal to the current sheet), which has a scale size less\nthan \u03c1i and peaks at -45 mV/m. The electron temperatures (Te) and density (ne) are shown in Figs. 1(e) and (f). In the region of peak EN, ne is nearly constant but exhibits a gradient at approximately 6.5 and 8.5 s.\nElectrostatic fluctuation spectra are calculated by taking\na spectrogram [55] of the EN burst measurement data prior to boxcar averaging. All panels in Fig. 2 show electrostatic\n3 DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A. Approved for public release. Distribution is unlimited.\nfluctuations from 2 to 20 Hz, where color specifies the\npower spectral density such that black indicates instrument\nnoise level and yellow indicates large amplitude fluctuations. The LH frequency (\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3b = 1\n2\ud835\udf0b \u221a\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52) at the\nBL reversal is 7 Hz. The peak fluctuations occur at 7.5 s with a frequency of approximately 10 Hz, indicating these\nare LH waves. The boxcar averaged EN (solid, blue) and ne (dashed, orange) are overlaid on the fluctuation spectra\n[Fig. 2(a)] showing that EN peaks during the largest amplitude fluctuations. The ne is nearly constant during the time of fluctuations, and when there is a gradient, no LH\nfluctuations are observed. There is a large ?\u20d1? \u00d7 ?\u20d1? velocity\nshear in ?\u0302? direction [Fig. 2(b), solid blue], where the wave\nactivity peaks. The total electron flow in ?\u0302?, VeL [Fig. 2(b), gray dot-dashed], is in the same direction as \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc38\u00d7\ud835\udc35,\nindicating that the electrons are ?\u20d1? \u00d7 ?\u20d1? drifting. Additionally, because VeL and \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc38\u00d7\ud835\udc35 are close in magnitude, the diamagnetic drift velocity (?\u20d1? \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61 = \u2207\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52 \u00d7 ?\u20d1? /(\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc35 2)) in the region of the wave localization is small compared to\nthe ?\u20d1? \u00d7 ?\u20d1? velocity. This indicates that the LH waves are driven by the sheared flow and not a density gradient.\nThe origin of the observed features can be gleaned from\nour kinetic model [7,56], which is extended to include a\nguide field [57]. Although the model includes magnetic\nfield components in the y- and z-directions, it uses a WKB\ntype ansatz, incorporating the strongest observed variation\nin the x-direction, perpendicular to the magnetic field. It\nconstructs an exact solution to the Vlasov-Maxwell\nequations for species \ud835\udefc by generalizing the Harris model to include an inhomogeneous guiding-center distribution,\n\ud835\udc530\ud835\udefc = \ud835\udc410\ud835\udefc\n(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc61\ud835\udefc 2 )\n3 2\n\ud835\udc44\ud835\udefc(\u03a5\ud835\udefc , \ud835\udf01\ud835\udefc)\ud835\udc52 \u2212\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udefc\u2212\ud835\udc48\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc66\u2212\ud835\udc49\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc67+ 1 2\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc48\ud835\udefc 2+ 1 2\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc49\ud835\udefc 2\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udefc (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc44\u03b1(\u03a5\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1) = \ud835\udc3a(\u03a5\u03b1) + \ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udf01\u03b1),\n\ud835\udc3a(\u03a5\u03b1) = 1\n2 [\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc66\u03b1 + \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\u03b1 + (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udefc \u2212 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc66\ud835\udefc)\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc53 (\n\u03a5\u03b1\u2212\u03a50\n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc66\u03b1 )],\n\ud835\udc3b(\u03b6\u03b1) = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc67\u03b1 + (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc67\u03b1 \u2212 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc67\u03b1)\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d (\u2212 (\ud835\udf01\ud835\udefc\u2212\ud835\udf010)\n2\n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc67\u03b1 2 ),\n\u03a5\ud835\udefc = [\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc65)/\ud835\udc350 + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc66/\u03a9\u03b1] and \ud835\udf01\ud835\udefc = [\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc67(\ud835\udc65)/\ud835\udc350 \u2212 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 +\n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc67/\u03a9\u03b1] are the canonical momenta, NoS\u03b1 and NoR\u03b1 are asymptotic densities on the high/low sides of the guiding\ncenter distributions, G and H, and B\u03bd is the vacuum component (due to external currents) of the guide field.\nThe quasi-neutrality condition gives the electrostatic\npotential and Ampere\u2019s law gives the vector potential. This\nallows inhomogeneous structures in the moments (e.g.\ndensity, current, temperature, flows) to self-consistently\ndevelop in response to compression, which is represented\nby the scale sizes \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc66\u03b1 and \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc67\u03b1 of G and H, similar to the case with no guide field described in [7]. The current sheet\n4 DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A. Approved for public release. Distribution is unlimited.\nevolves on slow fluid time scales under compression, but\nthe instability (Fig. 4) time scale is much faster. Hence, a\nstationary Vlasov solution is a reasonable assumption for\nunderstanding the wave effects. However, a simulation\ninitialized by Eq. (1) can provide a more accurate picture\nof the dynamics. Using the parameters provided in the\nsupplemental material [55], Fig. 3 compares MMS1 data\n(dashed, blue) to the model (solid, red) for (a) BL, (b) ViL,\n(c) VeL, (d) EN, and (e) electron current density in ?\u0302?. It shows that as a broad Harris-type current sheet undergoes\nglobal compression, an ambipolar electric field (EN) self-\nconsistently develops. This produces a sheared ?\u20d1? \u00d7 ?\u20d1? velocity, enabling shear-driven waves to arise in thin\ncurrent sheets. The presence of a guide magnetic field\nintroduces sheared parallel flows, \ud835\udc49|| = (?\u20d1? \u00d7 ?\u20d1? ) \ud835\udc35 2\u2044 \u2219\n?\u0302?\ud835\udc3f,\ud835\udc40, which can also drive waves [7]. Additionally, the bidirectional ViL flow profile is found to be a stationary Vlasov solution and therefore may not imply occurrence of\nmagnetic reconnection, as claimed [20]. Given the\nboundary conditions from the in situ measurements, the\nequilibrium model agrees with the general trends of the\nmeasurements. The observed profiles are relaxed because\nof the instability.\nOur model also shows that as current sheets are\ncompressed to scales less than \u03c1i, substructures embedded in the current density can form, which cannot be explained\nby the standard Harris equilibrium. The current density (J)\nis calculated from MMS FPI data (\ud835\udc3d = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56?\u20d1? \ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52?\u20d1? \ud835\udc52), where the electron term dominates (Vi << Ve). Since BM >\nBL, the electron current density in ?\u0302?, JeL, is dominant and is comparable to the cross-field Hall current, \ud835\udc3d \u2248 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc40). Fig. 3(e) shows the JeL data (dashed, blue) and model (solid, red). The large peak in JeL is localized to the region of EN and the waves. Both the data and model suggest the formation of a thin current sheet that has substructures\ncontained within.\nA distinguishing property of our equilibrium model is\nthe formation of agyrotropy in distribution functions [7],\nwhich has been seen in this event but was thought to be a\nwave heating effect [20]. Fig. 3(f) shows the electron\ndistribution function from the model, where the vertical\naxis is the electron flow in the direction along EN and the\nhorizontal axis is the direction of VE\u00d7BL\u0302, both normalized to the thermal velocity. The agyrotropy arises in the\nequilibrium distribution function due to the ambipolar\nelectric field.\nVelocity shear can drive LH waves even in the presence\nof a pressure gradient as long as the shear frequency (\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc60 \u223c\n|?\u20d1? \ud835\udc38\u00d7\ud835\udc35| \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc38\u2044 ) is greater than the diamagnetic drift frequency (\ud835\udf14\u2217 = \u2212\ud835\udc58\u22a5?\u20d1? \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61) [7,29,35,36,56]. The shear scale length (LE) can be estimated by taking the half-width at half-max of the boxcar averaged EN. The average LE is estimated to be 89 \u00b1 23 km such that \u03c1e < LE < \u03c1i. Following Norgren et al. [46], \ud835\udc58\u22a5 is calculated by first finding the time shift\nbetween EL measured from MMS1 and MMS2 (largest\nseparation in ?\u0302?). The wave phase speed is calculated using\nthe distance in ?\u0302? between MMS1 and MMS2 and the time shift between the signals. The phase speed is then used to calculate the fluctuation wavelength, \ud835\udc58\u22a5 = 2\ud835\udf0b\n\ud835\udf06 = 0.027 \u00b1\n0.01 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a\u22121. Fig. 2(c) shows that \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc60 (blue, solid) is an order of magnitude larger than \ud835\udf14\u2217 (orange, dashed), indicating that the velocity shear is the dominating energy source for\nthe waves. The Electron-Ion Hybrid (EIH) instability is\ndriven by the free energy provided by sheared\nflows [7,33,36,58] and characterized by \ud835\udc58\u22a5\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc52 \u226a 1 and \ud835\udc58\u22a5\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc38~1. Observations from this event give \ud835\udc58\u22a5\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc52 = 0.18 \u00b1 0.07 and \ud835\udc58\u22a5\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc38 = 2.4 \u00b1 1.2 reinforcing that the character of the LH fluctuations are consistent with EIH\ninstability and not the LHD instability. Vortices, reported\nearlier for this event [20], are also a natural consequence\nof the velocity shear that drives the EIH waves [35].\nIn order to compare this dataset with theory, we\ngeneralized the nonlocal theory of the EIH instability [59]\nto include a guide field and magnetic field reversal. A\nmodel equilibrium electric field, consistent with the\nobserved EN, is used to drive sheared flows in VL and VM. The parameters [55] used to solve the eigenvalue problem\nare consistent with observations. The eigenfunction\ncorresponding to the EIH mode with the maximum growth\nrate is localized around the strong VL flow near the center of the current sheet [Fig. 4(a)], also consistent with\nobservations. Solution of the eigenmode condition as a\nfunction of kL normalized by LE provides the growth rate and frequency [Fig. 4(b)] normalized to \u03c9LH, indicating a\n5 DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A.

Distribution is unlimited.\nlarge domain of the shear driven instability ideally located\nin the center of the current sheet for anomalous\ndissipation [35,60,61] to trigger reconnection.\nIn summary, in situ measurements show a localized\nambipolar electric field develops in a thin current sheet and\nresults in a strong sheared ?\u20d1? \u00d7 ?\u20d1? velocity, which drives LH fluctuations, with a negligible density gradient. The\nambipolar electric field breaks gyrotropy in the distribution\nfunction and drives waves capable of producing anomalous\nresistivity that can determine the reconnection rate. This\nimplies a seamless connection of the local reconnection\nrate with the global compression. With further research, it\nwill be possible to develop a parameterization of the\nanomalous resistivity suitable for fluid models to trigger\nreconnection for realistic parameters consistent with global\nforcing. Since 3D PIC simulations with large scales and\nmass ratios needed to capture the essential physics are\nexpensive, fluid models with a parameterization of the\nkinetic effects is an optimal way to explore the larger-scale\nphysics with local kinetic feedback.\nThe frozen-in condition may be broken by anomalous\nresistivity. However, the off-diagonal terms in the pressure\ntensor can also play a role [40,59,60]. Interestingly, off-\ndiagonal terms may also be generated by compression, as\nwas argued for dipolarization fronts [64]. Using our kinetic\nequilibrium as the initial condition in PIC simulations\ncould help reveal the impact of thin structured current\nsheets and the associated dynamics on reconnection, and\nthe relative roles of anomalous resistivity and off-diagonal\ncomponents of the pressure tensor. These are interesting\ntopics for further research.\nThis work was supported by the Naval Research\nLaboratory Base Program.
