In the present study, we\u00a0 investigated the utility of the co-occurrence network approach\u2019s to comprehensively explore both structure and potential functions of benthic marine microbial communities and their responses to Cu and Fe fractioning from two sediment deposition coastal zones of northern Chile via 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. The results revealed substantial differences in the microbial communities, with the predominance of two distinct module hubs based on study zone. This indicates that habitat influences microbial co-occurrence networks. Indeed, the discriminant analysis allowed us to identify keystone taxa with significant differences in eDNA and eRNA comparison between sampled zones, revealing that Beggiatoaceae, Carnobacteriaceae, and Nitrosococcaceae were the primary representatives from Off Loa, whereas Enterobacteriaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Latescibacteraceae, and Clostridiaceae were the families responsible for the observed changes in Mejillones Bay. The quantitative evidence from the multivariate analyses supports that the benthic microbial assemblages\u2019 features were linked to specific environments associated with Cu and Fe fractions, mainly in the Bay. Furthermore, the predicted functional microbial structure suggested that transporters and DNA repair allow the communities to respond to metals and endure the interacting variable environmental factors like dissolved oxygen, temperature, and salinity. Moreover, some active taxa recovered are associated with anthropogenic impact, potentially harboring antibiotic resistance and other threats in the coastal zone. Overall, the method of scoping eRNA in parallel with eDNA applied here has the capacity to significantly enhance the spatial and functional understanding of realtime microbial assemblages and, in turn, would have the potential to increase the\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 16 January 2023 DOI 10.3389/fmicb.2022.1020491"

            "text": "High abundance, diversity, and activity of microorganisms in marine sediments play vital roles in global biogeochemical cycles (Prokopenko et\u00a0al., 2013; Hoshino et\u00a0al., 2020), partially because they are involved in the transforming and degrading organic matter (Koho et\u00a0al., 2013), these processes, release nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients into the water column, thus facilitating the growth of primary producers and contributing to climate regulation (Cavicchioli et\u00a0 al., 2019). However, most previous studies that consider the composition and spatial distribution of microbial communities in coastal areas both worldwide (Jayakumar et\u00a0al., 2012; Glass et\u00a0al., 2015) and in Chile have focused on the water column (e.g., Molina et\u00a0 al., 2010, 2020, 2021; Stewart et\u00a0al., 2012; Ulloa et\u00a0al., 2012) and little is known about benthic microbial structure, activity and interactions in marine sediments that experience fluctuating redox conditions due to the oxygen-depleted waters and trace metal (TM) gradients (Far\u00edas et\u00a0al., 2004; Broman et\u00a0al., 2017; Rasigraf et\u00a0al., 2017; Miranda et\u00a0al., 2020).\nIn general, these conditions are generated by vertical geochemical zonation that results from the thermodynamically driven succession of organic matter (OM) availability and high-potential electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen and nitrate; Prokopenko et\u00a0al., 2013; Broman et\u00a0al., 2017; Rasigraf et\u00a0al., 2017). Therefore, marine sediments are considered both a sink and a source for OM as well as other nutrients and pollutants, contributing substantially to climate regulation processes via carbon burial (Koho et\u00a0al., 2013; Sander et\u00a0al., 2015). In fact, previous research carried out in northern Chilean coastal sediments, indicates that OM accumulation governs the biogeochemistry of the sediments bio-essential TMs such as Cu and Fe closely associated with nutrientrich but oxygen-depleted waters (Vald\u00e9s et\u00a0al., 2005, 2014; Plass et\u00a0al., 2020) via atmospheric deposition from the Atacama Desert and continental inputs, primarily the Loa River (Romero et\u00a0al., 2003; FloresAqueveque et\u00a0al., 2014). Moreover, although the TMs are important redox-active elements, they persist and accumulate, influencing the selection, distribution and dynamics of particular microbial guilds associated with metalloenzyme-involved metabolisms, such as nitrification or denitrification besides other processes related with sulfur cycling (Glass et\u00a0 al., 2015; Rasigraf et\u00a0 al., 2020), and therefore, establishing specific metabolic networks and geochemical profiles in marine zones associated with oxygen-depleted waters (Glass et\u00a0al., 2015; Rasigraf et\u00a0al., 2017).\nHence, the relevant question is whether microbial benthic communities and their control mechanisms will be\u00a0varied in the marine sediments with different depositional histories and fluctuating redox conditions due to the influence of oxygen-depleted waters and TMs gradients off northern Chile. We\u00a0hypothesized that the fractionation of Cu and Fe acts as a driving forces in modulating the structure of benthic microbial assemblages and could be\u00a0directly linked to the responses of active and resident communities. To test the hypothesis, we\u00a0combined\nthe analysis of DNA- and RNA-derived microbial 16S rRNA gene sequences from sediments of two contrasting coastal zones in northern Chile, one from the semi-enclosed Mejillones Bay, and the other that we\u00a0 referred to as the Off-Loa zone, as it has river input from the hyperarid Atacama Desert. We\u00a0 investigated the spatial microbial community characteristics, assembly patterns, gene prediction and environmental driving factors focusing on changes in response to Cu and Fe within 10\u201360 m water-depth gradient. Furthermore, we\u00a0 performed various network and statistical analyses in order to identify the significance of co-occurrence of microbial communities between contrasting study zones.\nCorrelation-based network analysis provides a good way to determine the potential interplays between microbes as well as their structuring and mediating ecological functions in various environments (Chaffron et\u00a0al., 2010; Banerjee et\u00a0al., 2018; Felipe-Lucia et\u00a0al., 2020), including the Mejillones Bay and Loa River (Z\u00e1rate et\u00a0al., 2020, 2021). Therefore, the results of the present study highlights important targets to better understand microbial responses to the bioavailability of TMs in low-oxygen sedimentary environments. This knowledge is indispensable for understanding and predicting how ecosystems will respond to many of today\u2019s biggest challenges, from climate change (hypoxia and warming) to the propagation of metal and antibiotic resistance mechanisms between microbes (Nogales et\u00a0 al., 2011; Hernando-Amado et\u00a0al., 2019)."

These sites were chosen as they fall located in a natural laboratory area.\nMB is located in the southeastern Pacific on the coast of the Atacama Desert and has been considered a semi-enclosed system with high biological production (Mar\u00edn et\u00a0al., 2003), strongly anthropized via the development of multiple mineral exporting harbors and a thermoelectric plant, leading to significant implications on the heavy metal (HM) accumulation in sediments (Vald\u00e9s, 2012; Castillo et\u00a0al., 2019; Z\u00e1rate et\u00a0al., 2021). OL is located approximately 210 km north of MB near the city of Iquique (Isla et\u00a0al., 2010). This area, though less studied than MB, has been described as a spawning and nursery area for small pelagic fish with high planktonic production (Santander et\u00a0 al., 2017), supporting world\u2019s largest fisheries (Herrera and Escribano, 2006; Palma et\u00a0al., 2006).

However, due to the water usage the Loa River discharge to the coastal zone is mainly sporadic owing to precipitation increases and flood (up to four orders of magnitude) mainly during austral summer (i.e., December and March; Romero et\u00a0al., 2003)."

Sediment subsamples from each of the same core fraction used in the nucleic acid analyses were used for measuring Cu and Fe concentration, total carbon (TC), nitrogen (TN), Sulfur content (TS) and grain size distribution. Briefly, the content of TC, TN, and TS was measured by analyzing ~3 mg of dry sediment on a LECO CHNS elemental analyzer (2400 series II, Perkin Elmer). Then the analytical procedure was verified with the analysis of sulfanilic acid (C6H7NO3S) as a reference material (Castillo et\u00a0al., 2019). At the collection sites, pH, salinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature (\u00b0C) of the water column were measured using a CTD-O profiler (SBE 19 plus V2 Sea cat, SeaBird)."

Raw sequences were demultiplexed, joined paired reads, quality-filtered, chimera checked, curated and analyzed using the DADA2 pipeline (Callahan et\u00a0al., 2016).\nAll sequences were filtered to truncate the paired reads to 150 nt and eliminate reads with quality values of <2. Error rates were estimated and corrected by pooling all the reads from the sequencing run, with default parameters. Taxonomy was assigned using the SILVA release v132 references alignment (Quast et\u00a0al., 2013). Resulting amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were analyzed using the Phyloseq package in R (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). Noteworthy, taxonomic data were analyzed by both order and family, levels that were chosen based on the number of classified ASVs (Supplementary Table S1). For ASVs that were not assigned taxonomies of these categories, we\u00a0used the last level classification (ending in \u201c_Unclassified\u201d).\nWithin-sample diversity (alpha diversity) was determined by calculating the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices (evenness) using the total number of observed ASV and Chao1 (richness; Shannon and Weaver, 1949; Oksanen et\u00a0al., 2020) in the vegan R packages (R Core Team, 2015). Beta-diversities of communities were compared using the non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) to visualize the levels of dissimilarity of communities with Bray-Curtis distance between samples. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) was used to test the significance of differences between groups of sampling zones (MB and OL) of the NMDS analyses. Venn diagrams were also constructed using the InteractiVenn (Heberle et\u00a0al., 2015) based on the distribution of families showing specific and shared ASVs between eDNA/eRNA and sampling zones.\nBenthic microbial communities and their correlation with environmental variables were explored by Spearman\u2019s correlation and permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices (PERMANOVA) to test the significance of variables using R statistical software. In addition, redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed for a better understanding of the correlation among abundant bacterial families and physicochemical parameters in different sampling zones using CANOCO v4.5 for Windows via Monte Carlo permutation testing with 999 permutations (Ter Braak and Smilauer, 2002). Variables with a variance inflation factor (VIF) of >20 were removed from the dataset one at a time in order to control for correlated explanatory variables which could inflate the variance of the canonical coefficients.\nTo highlight the substantial shifts in benthic microbial community assemblage, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe; Segata\nFrontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org\net\u00a0al., 2011) was used to identify taxa with significant differences between DNA and RNA at various taxonomic levels. In addition, a differential abundance analysis was performed with the DESeq2 (Love et\u00a0al., 2014) of the R library to identify the ASVs at the family level that have significant fold changes between the sampling zones (MB vs. OL) and water-depths. The log2 fold change plot was made with the significant ASVs at a value of p < 0.01. Finally, microbial community functional potential profiles were predicted based on 16S rRNA gene data using PICRUSt and the functional terms stored in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Langille et\u00a0al., 2013). The heatmap was created based on Bray\u2013 Curtis dissimilarity dendrogram of the functional capabilities detected.\nA co-occurrence network was applied to reveal the interaction between microbial communities. The network inference was estimated based on co-occurrence patterns based on Spearman\u2019s significant correlations (R > 0.75; p \u2264 0.001) at the family level using Fruchtermann\u2013 Reingold layout (Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991). In order to describe the topology of the resulting microbial network from the study zones (Supplementary Table S2), a set of metrics including edges, nodes,\ndegree, betweenness centrality (BC), clustering coefficient (CC), average path length, modularity and network diameter was calculated (Newman, 2003). Nodes with highest BC value, representing the relevance of a node as capable of holding together with communicating nodes, were recognized as possible \u201ckeystone taxa\u201d in co-occurrence networks (Brandes et\u00a0al., 2001). The network visualization and modular analysis were conducted in Gephi v0.9.2 software (Bastian and Heymann, 2009)."

All dilutions were prepared with deionized water. The plastic and glassware used were soaked in 5% HNO3 solution overnight and rinsed with distilled water prior to use. To evaluate the accuracy and precision of the BCR extraction in all samples, the marine sediment MESS-3 standards (National Research Council, Canada) were used following all the lab procedures.

The families that characterize the differences at 60 m consisted of VHS-B3-70 (Myxococcales), Latescibacteraceae, Omnitrophaceae, Desulfuromonadaceae and Thermoflexaceae in MB. In OL at 60 m, AB-539-J10 (Dehalococcoidia), Beggiatoaceae, TG3 (Fibrobacterales), Carnobacteriaceae, Bacillaceae and UBA12409 (Babeliales) were responsible for the differences observed (Supplementary Figure S6B)."

            "heading": "4.1. Integrated influence of the environmental heterogeneity-driven benthic microbial assemblages",
            "text": "To understand the patterns of microbial assemblages, determining the environmental driving factors is needed, which may play an important role in shaping the community (Tamburini et\u00a0al., 2020). To the best of our knowledge, there are few studies that have addressed the cumulative effects of oxygen-deficient waters on geochemical metal fractioning in Chilean benthic coastal environments. Thus, this study makes an effort to understand the distributions of Cu and Fe fractions from marine sediments, which is essential in determining the mobility and potential toxicity of TMs.\nThough the variation in fraction distributions was observed, recording higher concentrations the MB than in OL, the RF (considered an inert, immobile metal phase) was dominant in both TMs of the sampled zones. Chakraborty et\u00a0al. (2016) reported that concentrations of Cu associated with F3 and F4\u00a0in the Arabian Sea sediments were higher than their concentrations in the F1 and F2. As such, their actual bioavailability is likely to be\u00a0 rather low (chemically stable) and less harmful to the quality of the benthic environment (Cyriac et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition, the lability of Cu in sediment gradually decreased with decreasing DO levels of the bottom water, which in turn could increase their association with sedimentary OM (Sander et\u00a0al., 2015). Therefore, we\u00a0considered that the lower hydrodynamics of MB likely explained the higher levels of TMs when compared to OL, which is physically closer to the discharge of the Loa River.\nBesaury et\u00a0al. (2013) also reported decrease in the ratio of available/ total copper concentration alongside an increase of total organic carbon in marine sediments of Cha\u00f1aral Bay in northern Chile. Thus, it is possible that the low-oxygen levels recorded coupled with the high quantity of OM previously reported both MB and OL zones (Isla et\u00a0al., 2010; Castillo et\u00a0al., 2019) increase the geochemical sequestration of TMs and therefore controls bioavailable concentrations due to formation of non-labile complexes in the sediments (Strom et\u00a0al., 2011; Cyriac et\u00a0 al., 2021). Nevertheless, naturally occurring processes linked to changes in pH, salinity, decomposition and mineralization can favor the release of mobile metal fractions from the sediment to the overlying water, facilitating bioaccumulation processes within the benthic food webs (Chakraborty et\u00a0al., 2016). In this context, regular assessment to control metal pollution in the coastal environment is recommended (Cyriac et\u00a0 al., 2021). Moreover, marine sediments under high anthropogenic pressure constantly increase HM concentrations, which may lead to significant additional pollution (Jacquiod et\u00a0 al., 2018; Jroundi et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThe strategy of using eDNA and eRNA in parallel, revealed the previously unappreciated potential that both active and total microbial communities displayed contrasting patterns and respond differently to environmental heterogeneity gradient. In MB, both Cu and Fe fractions induced significant microbial communities shifts of\nDesulfarculales, Ignavibacteriales, Xanthomonadales, Aminicenantales, Pseudomonales, and Lactobacillales, whereas Pirellulales, Betaproteobacteriales, and Thermoanaerobaculales were closely related to changes in DO, salinity, and temperature. In contrast, only these two latter factors showed a significant correlation with Pirellulales and Thermoanaerobaculales in OL, implying that multiple interacting factors in similar environments could have a specific response at the microbial level. This is consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated the clear structuring effect of DO, salinity and temperature in different environments, therefore explaining a significant portion of global microbial community distribution patterns (Zinger et\u00a0al., 2011; Rodr\u00edguez et\u00a0al., 2018; Hoshino et\u00a0al., 2020). In the northwestern part of the Gulf of Mexico, the observed pattern was driven primarily by environmental gradients associated with local oceanographic parameters closely linked to water column depth, nutrients, temperature, salinity, OM, DO, and HMs (Jim\u00e9nez et\u00a0 al., 2018; Rodr\u00edguez et\u00a0 al., 2021). Such spatially structured environmental gradients allow micro niches development and promote the coexistence of microbial taxa that are considered regulators of ocean ecosystem services (Fortunato et\u00a0 al., 2012; Cavicchioli et\u00a0al., 2019).\nWhile environmental gradients clearly affect microbial abundance and activity, much of the spatial variation in microbial activity is linked to pollutant distribution and mobility (Quero et\u00a0al., 2015; Jacquiod et\u00a0al., 2018). In this study, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation and RDA analyses, suggested that MB\u2019s microbial structuration seemed to be\u00a0mainly driven by metal fractioning of Cu and Fe, whereas the major environmental determinants in OL were Fe fractioning, though statistically insignificant (Figure\u00a05; Supplementary Figure S6). It is noteworthy that Coclet et\u00a0al. (2021) found that Cu, Mn, and Zn modulated the predicted functional profiles of biofilm communities in an anthropized coastal area. These findings further support previous observations of the structural role of metals in other coastal microbial patterns (Jacquiod et\u00a0al., 2018; Coclet et\u00a0al., 2019), and even complimented via network analysis in different aquatic environments.\nRegarding the TMs effects observed in OL, the high water-sediment flow from the Loa River during altiplanic rain could have resulted in an increase in the mass effect and homogenization of sedimentary environmental conditions on the coastal, resulting in decrease in the differential of microbial response. Overall, quantitative evidence supported that the majority of each locale\u2019s (MB and OL) taxa is strongly associated with specific environmental features, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity linked to specific variables of study areas could affect the microbial community assemblage (Zhang et\u00a0 al., 2021). A possible explanation is that the different microbial assemblages have developed distinct mechanisms to adapt to environmental heterogeneity of study zones, driving stabilization of the functional structure and maintenance of ecological services (Zinger et\u00a0 al., 2011; Cavicchioli et\u00a0 al., 2019; Hoshino et\u00a0al., 2020).\nIndeed, the major functional pathways at both zones were involved in transporters, BC transporters, DNA repair, and recombination proteins, and signal transduction, which were previously found in an aquatic system affected by acid mine drainage. Such a finding highlights that transporters are involved in metal tolerance and detoxification (Coclet et\u00a0 al., 2021), particularly multiple efflux systems that allow microbes to sense and respond to variable environmental conditions and adapt to the environment (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015). These results are fundamental value because understanding how different local regimes of environmental variability modify the spatial structure of benthic\nFrontiers in Microbiology 12 frontiersin.org\ncommunities may provide a starting point to consider how communities could respond to future climate changes and metal pollution scenarios in reduced oxygen environments (Cavicchioli et\u00a0al., 2019).\nHowever, these results must be\u00a0 interpreted carefully because it should be\u00a0recognized that, while microbial community structure could be\u00a0 influenced by variables measured within this study, additional variables that were not measured (e.g., nitrogen, sulfur content) could also affect microbial community structure (Far\u00edas et\u00a0al., 2004; Hoshino et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, future work should aim to employ an integrated metatranscriptomic and metagenomic approach to functional inferences. The combination of these methods can concurrently investigate the transcriptional patterns of specific microbes, revealing their overall functional and metabolic activities within the whole community (Stewart et\u00a0al., 2012)."

            "text": "The benthic microbial assemblages from two contrasting coastal study zones revealed strong spatial variation patterns with a large fluctuation in microbial communities in terms of taxonomic composition. This contributed to the keystone taxa groups that formed, distinguishing two strong module hubs from each study area. The taxa that are defined as module hubs and connectors of the network are regarded as keystone taxa due to their role in maintaining network structures, and they may play a role in maintaining ecosystem stability (Cui et\u00a0al., 2019).\nOverall, the keystone taxa we\u00a0observed in the benthic microbial community may expand the range of possible metabolic roles into sediments, elucidating their ecological niches. A clear example of this was the identification of Calditrichaceae (phylum Calditrichaeota) in the sediments of MB, which probably pointed to a stronger line of evidence for the importance of this family in marine sediments, as it has been previously reported as an unrecognized but significant player in geochemical element cycling that is able to degrade detrital proteins (Marshall et\u00a0al., 2017). Many members of the family Flavobacteriaceae have been isolated from marine environments and also have the capacity to degrade high-molecular-weight organic polymers, including cellulose, chitosan, and proteins (Yang et\u00a0 al., 2020). Moreover, this particular family has the ability to tolerate toxic effects of certain metals (Quero et\u00a0al., 2015; Tamburini et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThe reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes in the microbial-mediated sulfur cycle determined that Sedimenticolaceae possess near-complete, encoded pathways for denitrification (Vavourakis et\u00a0 al., 2019). Indeed, along with Desulfobulbaceae, Sedimenticolaceae was the most abundant family reported in association with marine sediments from Chilean salmonid farms (Miranda et\u00a0al., 2020). Furthermore, some of these families including Desulfobacteraceae were observed in the permanent anoxic/hypoxic sediment in the deepest part of the Baltic Sea, which highlighted active functional traits related to OM degradation, reduction of sulfate, and methanogenesis (Broman et\u00a0al., 2017).\nNetwork analysis also facilitated further identification of Thermoanaerobaculaceae as the major representative of OL, which have been previously described as thermophilic in the sediments of Boka Kotorska Bay (Montenegro, Croatia; Jokanovi\u0107 et\u00a0al., 2021). Interestingly, some prominent keystone taxa in our study belonged to the bacteria rare subcommunity, which indicated that these microbes may compose the\nhidden backbone of microbial communities. Furthermore, the betadiversity analysis showed a clear distinction between the microbial assemblages in MB and OL with significantly higher richness (Chao1; p < 0.05) in the DNA samples compared to the RNA samples across sampled water-depths.\nIn accordance with discriminant analysis for the spatial variation between the sampled zones revealed that Beggiatoaceae, Carnobacteriaceae, Tenderiaceae, Saprospiraceae, Family XI_2I and Nitrosococcaceae were representative of OL. For MB, Enterobacteriaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Latescibacteraceae, Clostridiales Incertae Sedis, Iamiaceae, Clostridiaceae and Solirubrobacterales_67-14 were the families responsible for the observed changes, indicating the dispersal of fecal bacteria from the anthropogenically affected coastal area and therefore representing a reservoir of pathogenicity potentially harmful to human health (Nogales et\u00a0al., 2011). Indeed, feco\u2013oral route is the most important route of transmission especially for resistant pathogens of the family Enterobacteriaceae (Aslam et\u00a0al., 2018).\nBased on several active bacteria detected, such as Burkholderia, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas groups, which are resistant to various antibiotics, the influence of MB environment is also of concern Mainly due to pose a serious threat to global human, animal, and environmental health, a concern recognized by numerous important organizations such as the World Health Organization (Aslam et\u00a0al., 2018; Miranda et\u00a0al., 2018). However, the above differential assemblage compositions among study zones also suggest the cooperation between all organisms, potentially translating into success of the whole ecosystem (Cardoso et\u00a0al., 2017), because they reveal the performed functions that are either similar or complementary to each other and may co-occur due to shared and preferred environmental conditions (Jroundi et\u00a0al., 2020).\nPrevious studies that have analyzed eRNA in parallel with eDNA also reported significantly higher values in the overall community. What is more, DNA sampling (living, dead, eaten, and recently moved through the sediments) is logistically simpler than sampling RNA or the active community, which usually contains fewer communities (review Birrer et\u00a0al., 2018; Pawlowski et\u00a0al., 2022 for more details); it should be\u00a0noted that this is not always the case because eRNA is usually more sensitive, particularly for biosecurity applications, where detecting viable non-indigenous organisms is critical. Therefore, highlighting new opportunities for integrating functional genomics into environmental monitoring programs that may inform management actions in order to represent real-time ecological change and impacts could serve as a predictive tool for identifying at-risk habitats (Bowers et\u00a0al., 2021), especially as sequencing costs decline. Therefore, the findings of this study help to lay the groundwork for scoping eRNA in parallel with eDNA applied to significantly enhance the spatial and functional understanding of real-time microbial assemblages and, in turn, to increase the acuity of biomonitoring programs key to responding to immediate management needs for the marine environment.\nCampbell and Kirchman (2012) explain the decoupling between abundance and microbial activity as a result of grazing and virus lysis. Interestingly, sediment chemistry can affect the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification, especially in polluted sediments like those of MB (Vald\u00e9s et\u00a0al., 2005; Vald\u00e9s, 2012; Castillo et\u00a0al., 2019), where organic and inorganic compounds bind to the sediment (Sander et\u00a0al., 2015). It is also important to note that the potential bias in the differential nucleic acids extraction and amplification could generate an underestimation of some groups diversity (Cardoso et\u00a0al., 2017; Birrer\nFrontiers in Microbiology 13 frontiersin.org\net\u00a0al., 2018). For this reason, the libraries were normalized by an equal number of sequences before performing calculations or statistical tests.\nWhen exploring the spatial co-occurrence patterns of microbial assemblages between study zones, two distinct module hubs (regions densely connected) were clearly observed in both MB and OL networks, indicating that habitat significantly influenced the microbial co-occurrence networks (Cui et\u00a0al., 2019; Felipe-Lucia et\u00a0al., 2020). In fact, the habitat preference of microorganisms may play a vital role in determining their co-occurrence patterns (Chaffron et\u00a0al., 2010; Jroundi et\u00a0al., 2020). It was found that the microbial network in the OL benthic zone showed higher complexity (given the value of modularity) compared to the MB (as described in the results). The lower modularity network in MB, could mean that its communities are more vulnerable and sensitive to various disturbances, demonstrating that, in high-stress environments, their communities could break down (Banerjee et\u00a0al., 2018; Philippot et\u00a0al., 2021).\nThat said, the high modularity in OL mainly indicates diverse micro-niches and structured microbial communities (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2021), characteristic of large complex systems that imply a higher ecological degree of stability under perturbations. This improves efficiency in transferring information, energy, and resources of microbial communities, regard to sediment nutrient conversion and pollutant biodegradation (Santolini and Barab\u00e1si, 2018; Philippot et\u00a0al., 2021). One explanation for the high spatial connectivity and the selection of the microbe pool in the coastal area surrounding the OL may also be\u00a0attributed to the Loa River, which acts as a true green/life corridor that runs across the hyper-arid core of the Atacama Desert also known as the dry limit for life on Earth, helping to establish specific networks (Z\u00e1rate et\u00a0al., 2020). In this way, the input may support a distinct set of microbial processes that remain unstudied (Fortunato et\u00a0al., 2012; Fazi et\u00a0al., 2020; Jroundi et\u00a0al., 2020).\nFor instance, in the coastal wetlands of both the Yellow River Delta (China) and the northern Adriatic Sea (Italy), it has been emphasized that river input altered microbial structure patterns (Fazi et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhao et\u00a0 al., 2020). Thus, the results of this study are consistent with the environmental microbiomes that highlight associations between prokaryotic consortia, representing potential metabolic interactions with habitat transition (Chaffron et\u00a0 al., 2010; Petro et\u00a0 al., 2017) and local heterogeneity that is usually characterized by highly productive systems. In addition, in the Yap Trench (Western Pacific Ocean), the formation of multiple modules that respond to the environmental heterogeneity in sediments was also reported, providing evidence for ecological niche differentiation (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2021). This study also highlights the relevance of the 66.2% of the resident microbial communities that were shared in the study areas, suggesting that they harbor a persistent functional pool of ecological potential that may be\u00a0temporally consistent and regionally transferable (Clark et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, it is possible to propose that these common taxa could be\u00a0more useful for the development of coastal health assessment and biological monitoring tools (Sun et\u00a0al., 2013; Quero et\u00a0 al., 2015). It is crucial to clarify the processes underlying changes microbial communities and ecosystems in response to environmental perturbations (Nogales et\u00a0al., 2011; Cavicchioli et\u00a0al., 2019)."

            "text": "This study demonstrated that microbial assemblages from two contrasting benthic coastal zones in northern Chile were highly diverse and strongly regulated by a combination of different\nenvironmental factors including Cu, Fe, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature, Such conditions led to heterogeneous distribution with rare communities that contributed to keystone taxa in networks similar to large complex systems, which potentially serve a key role in ecosystem function, though the temporal dynamics of which requires further description and understanding. Additionally, we\u00a0highlight the possibility that the keystone taxa identified could serve as a basis for future monitoring programs of contaminated environments. This is especially true for the microbial processes occurring in the sediment of Mejillones Bay, whose bacteria could play an important role in the region exchange of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the eRNA in parallel with eDNA approach utilized here has the capacity to significantly enhance the spatial and functional understanding of real-time microbial assemblages and, in turn, would have the potential to increase the acuity of biomonitoring programs that are key to addressing the global concern of antimicrobial resistance from the coastal environment. Hence, future work should aim to further experimental validation and cultivation-based approaches will be\u00a0 required to identify consistent responses of such indicator taxa, employing an integrated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to reveal functional and metabolic activities within the whole microbial benthic community."
