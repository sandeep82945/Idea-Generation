Phytochemical Isolation and Characterization: Building on the diverse phytochemical profile of Pelargonium quercetorum extracts, future research could focus on the isolation and detailed characterization of individual compounds, especially those not yet fully explored. This would involve using advanced chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques to identify and characterize novel bioactive compounds, with a particular focus on those with cytotoxic, antioxidant, and enzyme inhibitory activities.

Mechanistic Studies on Anti-inflammatory and Anticancer Effects: Given the promising results on the anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities of Pelargonium quercetorum extracts, further studies could delve into the mechanisms of action at the molecular level. This would involve exploring signal transduction pathways, examining the effects on other inflammatory and tumor markers, and conducting in vivo studies to confirm the efficacy and safety of these extracts in animal models of cancer and inflammation.

Development of Pharmaceutical Formulations: With the ethyl acetate extract showing significant cytotoxic effects against colon cancer cells and both extracts demonstrating anti-inflammatory properties, there is a potential for developing pharmaceutical or nutraceutical formulations. Research could focus on optimizing extraction processes, enhancing bioavailability, and conducting preclinical and clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety profiles.

Exploration of Synergistic Effects and Compound Interactions: Future research could explore the synergistic effects between different compounds within Pelargonium quercetorum extracts. Investigating how these compounds interact could provide insights into optimizing extract compositions for specific therapeutic applications, enhancing their biological activities, and minimizing potential side effects.

Comprehensive Pharmacokinetic and ADMET Profiling: While the paper provides preliminary in silico ADMET data, comprehensive pharmacokinetic studies, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profiles of the bioactive compounds, especially in animal models, would be crucial. These studies could help in understanding the bioavailability, efficacy, and safety of these compounds or extracts in vivo, paving the way for clinical development.
