For example, the abundance f massive MW satellites is consistent with Lambda cold dark atter ( CDM) predictions only if its virial mass is not significantly igher than \u223c10 12 M (Boylan-Kolchin, Bullock & Kaplinghat 2012 ; awala et al. 2015 ). More generally, through the predicted amount of ubstructure, the mass of the MW also places constraints on the dark atter particle mass (Kennedy et al. 2014 ; Lo v ell et al. 2014 ). If the ass of the MW or M31 is much lower than \u223c10 12 M , abundance atching would imply that they are clear outliers in the galaxy\u2013 alo relation (Guo et al. 2011 ). The MW also contains the besttudied \u2018plane of satellite\u2019 (P a wlowski 2018 ), whose significance as challenge to the dark matter paradigm and its nature as a possibly ong-lived disc may depend both on the LG\u2019s mass assembly history Libeskind et al. 2010 ) and the depth of the potential in which the atellites evolve (Sawala et al. 2022 ). Beyond satellite galaxies, the warf galaxies in the LG and their comparison to galaxies in other nvironments have also received attention, and the total mass of the G is important for understanding the environment in which they\norm (e.g. Font et al. 2022 ). Much attention has therefore been devoted in recent years to easuring the mass of the MW, M31, and the LG using different echniques. Ho we ver, while measurements of each individual galaxy, nd of the MW in particular, have found masses of the order of 10 12 M , dynamical measurements of the total mass typically yield\nE-mail: till.sawala@helsinki.fi\nT t d\nThe Author(s) 2023. ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.

We show how he estimates can be further constrained assuming independent meaurements for either the MW or M31, and how individual constraints, ombined with the kinematics and the mass ratio distribution, can e used to infer that the mass of the MW is below that of M31. We lso revisit the \u2018Timing Argument\u2019, and explore whether there is, in act, a discrepancy between the kinematics of the LG and the mass stimates for individual objects.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we re vie w revious measurements of the individual masses and of the total ass of the LG, highlighting the apparent discrepancy. In Section 3 , e describe the simulations and our selection of LG analogues. n Section 4 , we introduce \u2018tidal dominance\u2019 and \u2018force ratio\u2019 s important criteria for linking the mass to the kinematics. We resent our results for estimating the mass of the LG using Gaussian egression in Section 5 . In Section 6 , we compute probability ensities for the masses of the LG, MW, M31 and the mass ratios, ased on a probability-weighted analysis. Finally, we conclude with summary in Section 7 .\nP R E V I O U S MEASUREMENTS\nhe flurry of measurements of the MW mass o v er the past 3 yr reflect he significance of the result, as well as the wealth of newly available ata, particularly from Gaia DR2 and, most recently, Gaia DR3.\nis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative ch permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nM\nk 1 e k 1 e o 2\nd b f 0 ( t ( u e ( G G s t A l c t\nt e i ( k 1 S o 2 ( a o h M t\nM 2 i t i M t ( s e\na d a d M e\nL D 5 H t 2 C\nt s o 1\ni i o\nn k t a f 2 o\n3\nT U w I h 4 r p 0 \u03c3 R p k h c c\n3\nO t 2 M a m w H fi T v S v v i k\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/4/4863/7084035 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nExcluding estimates that derive the mass of the MW from LG inematics, recent estimates of the virial mass of the MW include . 17 + 0 . 21 \u22120 . 15 \u00d7 10 12 M using Gaia DR2 satellite dynamics (Callingham t al. 2019 ), 1 . 54 + 0 . 75 \u22120 . 44 \u00d7 10 12 M using combined Gaia DR2 and HST inematics of globular clusters (Watkins et al. 2019 ), 1 . 51 0 . 45 \u22120 . 40 \u00d7 0 12 M using Gaia DR2 proper motions of satellite galaxies (Fritz t al. 2020 ), and 0 . 89 + 0 . 1 \u22120 . 08 \u00d7 10 12 M derived from the kinematics f disc and halo stars in the galkin catalogue (Karukes et al. 020 ).

We refer the reader o Wang et al. ( 2020 ) for a comprehensi ve re vie w of earlier results. nalyses from several different tracers, and particularly from the atest studies using the most precise Gaia EDR3 observations, onsistently point towards an MW virial mass that is very close o 10 12 M .\nWhile M31 does not enjoy the benefit of Gaia proper motions, here exist nevertheless a number of studies of its mass. Again, xcluding measurements that use LG kinematics, previous results nclude 1.4 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10 12 M derived from satellite kinematics Watkins, Evans & An 2010 ), 1 . 2 + 0 . 9 \u22120 . 7 \u00d7 10 12 M derived from inematics of M31 dwarf spheroidals (Tollerud et al. 2012 ), \u223c . 05 + 0 . 15 \u22120 . 15 \u00d7 10 12 M (combining the DM and stellar mass) from ED fitting together with the rotation curve and the kinematics of uter globular clusters and satellite galaxies (Tamm et al. 2012 ), . 0 + 0 . 4 \u22120 . 3 \u00d7 10 12 M from kinematics of the Giant southern stream Fardal et al. 2013 ), 1 . 35 + 0 . 15 \u22120 . 15 \u00d7 10 12 M (Veljanoski et al. 2013 ) nd 1 . 4 + 0 . 2 \u22120 . 2 \u00d7 10 12 M (Veljanoski et al. 2014 ), both derived from uter halo globular clusters, and 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10 12 M estimated from igh-velocity planetary nebulae (Kafle et al. 2018 ). Compared to the W, the scatter in mass estimates is larger, but most estimates are in he range of 1\u20132 \u00d7 10 12 M . Combining the best individual estimates for the masses of the W and M31 thus leads to a total combined mass in the range of \u20133 \u00d7 10 12 M . These estimates also suggest a mass ratio which s close to unity, and a scenario where the mass of M31 is lower han that of the MW is certainly not ruled out. Given the difference n stellar mass, it is still commonly assumed that the mass of\n31 is larger than that of the MW. Ho we ver, it is worth noting hat abundance matching implies higher masses for both haloes Guo et al. 2010 ), which also implies considerable scatter in the tellar\u2013halo mass relation in order to be consistent with these mass stimates.\nMeanwhile, estimates for the combined mass using the timing rgument in CDM yield significantly higher results. Examples of irect timing argument measurements using only the radial velocity re 5.27 \u00d7 10 12 M (Li & White 2008 ), 5 . 58 + 0 . 85 \u22120 . 72 \u00d7 10 12 M (van er Marel & Guhathakurta 2008 ), and 4 . 27 + 0 . 45 \u22120 . 45 \u00d7 10 12 M (van der arel et al. 2012 ). Accounting also for cosmic bias, van der Marel t al. ( 2012 ) measure 4.93 \u00b1 1.6 \u00d7 10 12 M . Meanwhile Partridge,\nNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\nahav & Hoffman ( 2013 ) found 4.73 \u00b1 1.03 \u00d7 10 12 M incorporating ark Energy into the timing argument. Benisty et al.

Accounting for\nhe velocity of the MW within the LG system (Petersen & Pe \u0303 narrubia 020 ), Chamberlain et al. ( 2023 ) obtain 4 . 5 + 0 . 8 \u22120 . 8 \u00d7 10 12 M using epheid and Gaia data. McLeod et al. ( 2017 ) used artificial Neural Networks to infer he mass of the LG based on LG analogues from a cosmological imulation with a volume of \u223c0.2 Gpc 3 and found a total mass f 4 . 9 1 . 3 \u22121 . 4 \u00d7 10 12 M when assuming a low transverse velocity of 7 \u00b1 17 km s \u22121 (van der Marel et al. 2012 ). On the whole, these results are significantly higher, and also appear nconsistent with the masses of the MW and M31 measured from nternal kinematic tracers, including neutral H I gas, the stellar disc, r the motions of halo stars, globular clusters, or satellite galaxies. Fig. 1 gives an overview of these measurements. It is worth oting that some previous results that are not limited to pair inematics appear to bridge the gap. Benisty et al. ( 2022 ) report hat the Timing Argument mass reduces to 3.4 \u00d7 10 12 M when ccounting for cosmic bias, i.e. taking into account the halo mass unction. Pe \u0303 narrubia et al. ( 2014 ) obtain an e ven lo wer v alue of .3 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10 12 M from a Bayesian model of galaxies extending ut to a distance of 3 Mpc.\nSI MULATI ONS\nhis work is based entirely on publicly available data from the CHUU collisionless cosmological simulation (Ishiyama et al. 2021 ), hich samples a volume of nearly 26 Gpc 3 with 12 800 3 particles.\nn total, at z = 0, the UCHUU simulation contains \u223c250 million aloes in the mass range of 0.5\u20135 \u00d7 10 12 M , and a particle mass of .83 \u00d7 10 8 M implies that the lowest mass haloes we consider are esolved with more than 1000 particles. UCHUU uses cosmological arameters corresponding to the Planck 2018 results, namely, 0 = .3089, b = 0.0486, = 0.6911, h = 0.6774, n s = 0.9667, and 8 = 0.8159. The simulation outputs have been processed using the OCKSTAR phase-space structure finder. All results reported in this aper are expressed in terms of physical coordinates, distances in pc, masses in solar masses (M ), and velocities in km s \u22121 . For the alo mass, we use the most common definition M 200, c , i.e. the mass ontained within a sphere enclosing a mean density of 200 times the ritical density.\n.1 Definition of LG analogues\nbservations accurately measure the distance between the centres of he MW and Andromeda as r = 765 \u00b1 11 kpc (Chamberlain et al. 023 ), and the radial velocity as v r = 109.3 \u00b1 4.4 km s \u22121 (van der arel et al. 2012 ). The transverse velocity is less certainly known, nd some measurements strongly differ. Using only HST proper otions, van der Marel et al. ( 2012 ) found v t = 17 \u00b1 17 km s \u22121 , hich would imply an extremely radial orbit. Later combining ST and Gaia DR2 proper motions, van der Marel et al. ( 2019 ) nd a somewhat higher value and measure v t = 57 + 35 \u221231 km s \u22121 . his measurement constitutes a weighted average of an HST -only alue of 36 + 39 \u221226 km s \u22121 , and a Gaia -only value of 133 + 70 \u221268 km s \u22121 . alomon et al. ( 2016 ) derived an even greater transv erse v elocity of t = 164.4 \u00b1 61.8 km s \u22121 by studying the projected line-of-sight elocities of M31 satellites, and comparing the results to those found n simulations. Salomon et al. ( 2021 ) measure v t = 82.4 \u00b1 31.2 m s \u22121 using Gaia DR3 proper motions of blue main sequence\ns t w w t c\nh\nm m m a t o\nd o s v s i\no i t ( c h m m s m a\n4\nT o o o t L s e e o p\nd i I t t s\ntars in M31. We adopt here v t = 57 \u00b1 35 km s \u22121 , very similar o the combined result of van der Marel et al. ( 2019 ). Whenever e Monte-Carlo sample the uncertainties, or construct probabilityeighted estimates, we assume that the probability distributions for he true values of r , v r , and v t are Gaussian, subject to the additional onstraints r > 0 and v t > 0.\nOur broadest category of LG analogues is defined as a pair of aloes that satisfy all of the following criteria:\n(i) each M 200 mass within [0.5. . . 5] \u00d7 10 12 M (ii) separation, r , within [500. . . 1000] kpc (iii) radial velocity, v r , within [ \u2212250. . . 0] km s \u22121 (iv) transv erse v elocity, v t , within [0. . . 250] km s \u22121 (v) no further halo more massive than 0.5 \u00d7 10 12 M within 2 Mpc It is worth noting that the kinematics constrain primarily the total ass of the LG. The kinematics also allow, for example, a high ass halo paired with a halo below the defined mass range, so we ust consider the lower limit of 0.5 \u00d7 10 12 M for each halo as an\ndditional, fixed prior. As we will discuss, this has implications for he inferred mass ratio, but is, ho we ver, well-moti v ated from other bservations. In total, the UCHUU simulation contains \u223c1.4 million systems efined using the criteria abo v e. In Fig. 2 , we show the distribution f these LG analogues within the volume. The panel on the left hows the entire volume of nearly 26 Gpc 3 . The uniquely large olume of the UCHUU simulation at this resolution allows us to retain ufficiently large sample sizes, even when additional constraints are mposed.\nIt should also be noted that the LG, whether in the real Universe r in cosmological simulations, is not a true two-body system. It ncludes mass beyond the respective r 200 of its two main haloes, o which different tracers may be sensitive to different degrees Pe \u0303 narrubia & Fattahi 2017 ). Throughout this paper, we adopt the onvention of defining the mass of the LG as the sum of the two alo masses, or M LG = M 1 + M 2 . We distinguish between the more assive halo whose mass we label M 1 and the less massive halo of ass M 2 . We do not generally associate them with the MW or M31 pecifically, except where we additionally constrain the MW halo ass in Section 6.3 , where we label the mass of the MW as M MW nd that of M31 as M 31 .\nT RU E LG A NA L O G U E S\nhe degree to which the mass of the LG is related to the kinematics f the MW-M31 orbit depends on the degree to which the motion f each object is affected by their common gravitational field, r by other haloes. For example, the \u2018Timing argument\u2019 assumes hat the system evolves in complete isolation. Previous works (e.g. i & White 2008 ; Carlesi et al. 2016 ; Fattahi et al. 2016 ) that elected LG analogues from cosmological simulations have typically xcluded systems that contain a third object within some radius, ither abo v e the lower limit of the range of halo masses considered r, less restricti vely, more massi ve than the less massive of the air. Ho we ver, we find that this is not sufficient to ensure that the ynamics of the simulated LG analogues are free of undue outside nfluences, i.e. greater than assumed to be the case for the real LG. n this section, we introduce two new criteria, tidal dominance , and he external-to-internal force ratio . We use them together to identify rue LG pairs, i.e. those pairs go v erned by internal kinematics to a imilar extent as the real LG.\nMNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\nM\nFigure 2.

For each halo, we can identify a more massive halo hat e x erts the greatest tidal force. This allows us to identify LG nalogues in which the tidal field of one LG member is dominated y the other, as opposed to those for which the tidal fields of both aloes are dominated by other objects. We refer to LG analogues in he first category as \u2018tidally dominant\u2019 and the remainder as \u2018tidally ubdominant\u2019. It is expected that the relations between kinematics and mass only old for tidally dominant systems. Indeed, this is the case. In Fig. , we plot distributions of UCHUU LG analogue masses as functions f the three kinematic parameters. The left panel shows total mass, LG , as a function of r and v r , while the right panel shows M LG as function of r and v t . For tidally dominant systems, shown on top, here are clear correlations, as also shown in previous studies (e.g. attahi et al. 2016 ): at fixed separation, LG analogues with more e gativ e radial v elocity or higher transv erse v elocity tend to hav e igher masses, although some scatter is also apparent. For tidally subdominant systems, shown on the bottom and omprising \u223c 8 per cent of the total sample, the kinematics are rimarily go v erned by forces outside the system itself. Consequently, he mass of the system is largely uncorrelated with the kinematics. In articular, we find a large number of low-mass tidally subdominant ystems with kinematics similar to the LG not due to internal rocesses, but due to random, external perturbations. We refer to the subsets of tidally dominant and subdomnant LG analogues as T dom and T sub , respectively, and reo v e the subdominant systems from most of our subsequent nalysis. .2 Force ratio\ne also consider the gravitational forces e x erted by the two LG embers on each other, and compare them to the forces e x erted on\nach member by every other halo abo v e 2 \u00d7 10 11 M within 5 Mpc f the LG centre.

A low value of F means that the forces which he two LG members e x ert on each other dominate the gravitational nteractions of both haloes, while a high value of F means that, for t least one of the two LG members, at least one other halo e x erts a ignificant force.\nThe kinematics of systems with low force ratios are determined y the LG itself, while the kinematics of systems with high force atios are strongly affected by haloes outside the pair. We classify ur LG analogues according to F as either \u2018internally dominated\u2019, ith F < 0 . 5 comprising approximately two-thirds of all systems, nd \u2018significantly externally affected\u2019 with F \u2265 0 . 5, comprising the emaining approximately one-third of the sample.\nIn Fig. 4 , we show the correlations of mass and kinematics or LG analogues in the three categories. We find that there is a lear separation: halo pairs with low force ratios have the strongest orrelation with the least amount of scatter, while halo pairs with high orce ratios show a weaker correlation between mass and kinematics, nd significantly more scatter. The real LG most likely contains no alo with a mass abo v e 2 \u00d7 10 11 M . With a distance to Centaurus A f 3.4 Mpc, approximately five times the distance between the MW nd M31, and its mass approximately 10 \u00d7 greater than that of the W or M31, we estimate F LG \u223c 0 . 4. Throughout the rest of this paper, we will refer to the set of LG nalogues that are both \u2018tidally dominant\u2019 and have force ratios < 0 . 5, as true pairs.\n.3 Distributions of kinematic variables\nn Fig. 5 , we show the distributions of the three kinematic variables, , v r , and v t . On all panels, the grey bands indicate the assumed 1 \u03c3 nd 2 \u03c3 observational errors, as discussed in Section 3.1 . The pink olid lines show the distributions for the full set of LG analogues, nd the thick blue solid lines show the distributions for the \u2018true\u2019 LG nalogues. The grey lines show the distributions for the LG analogues ot included in the true sample: dotted for tidally subdominant ystems and dashed for those with F \u2265 0 . 5.\nIt can be seen that all three variables are distributed differently for he different subsets. True LG analogues have, on average, smaller eparation than those in the F \u2265 0 . 5 or T sub subsets, and smaller han the full sample, where these two subsets are included. This s expected because, all else being equal, the internal forces are\nFigure 3. The LG mass as a function of r and v r (left column), and as a function of r and v t (right column). The top row shows results for tidally dominant LG analogues. There is a clear correlation between mass and the kinematic parameters: at fixed separation, a greater magnitude of v r or v t both correlate with greater mass. At fixed v r , a greater separation, r , correlates with greater mass, but at fixed v t , the mass is not strongly dependent on separation. The bottom row shows results for tidally subdominant LG analogues, that is, where a third object either inside or outside the LG e x erts the greatest tidal force on the lower mass halo. The number of these systems increases with separation, the masses are o v erall lower, and largely uncorrelated with the kinematics of the pair.\nFigure 4. The LG mass as a function of r and v r (left column), and as a function of r and v t (right column), similar to Fig. 3 . The top row shows results for low force ratio systems ( F < 0 . 5), while the bottom row shows high force ratio systems ( F > 0 . 5). In low force ratio systems, the gravitational fields of the two haloes dominate their o v erall gravitational interactions, resulting in a clear correlation between kinematics and mass. In high force ratio systems, other haloes cause significant perturbations to the gravitational field, blurring this correlation. The increased scatter with increased F also means that regions only sparsely populated in the top panels, such as very low v r or very high v t , contain significantly more systems in the bottom panels.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/4/4863/7084035 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nMNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\nM\nFigure 5.

The grey lines show LG analogues we exclude from our analysis: for T sub (dotted lines), none of the LG members dominate the other\u2019s tidal force, while for F > 0 . 5 (dashed lines), a third halo e x erts a gravitational force on one of the LG members which is larger than 0.5 of the force e x erted by the other member. Both of these subsets contain haloes with very high or low radial, and high transverse velocities, which are not related to the internal kinematics. When haloes in either of these two subsets are remo v ed, the remainder (\u2018true pairs\u2019, thick blue lines) is more likely to match each of the observed values, and shows a stronger correlation between mass and kinematics.\nr s s\nn o ( t f s o g a o f\n4\nI p h o T s r a t v o n t o\nS o m t\nt s o i k p o m\n5 R\nW G t u i ( k\n\u2018 f l ( A g t W f n w o\na a e p\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/4/4863/7084035 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nelatively stronger for lower separation systems. The fraction of ystems that match the observations for r is nearly identical in all ubsets. The differences in radial and transverse velocity are more proounced: the set of true LG analogues contain significantly more bjects with either v ery ne gativ e ( v r < \u2212150 kms \u22121 ) or v ery small v r > \u221250 kms \u22121 ) radial velocities, or with high ( v t > 100 kms \u22121 ) ransv erse v elocities, compared to the F \u2265 0 . 5 and T sub subsets. In act, the majority of the full sample of LG analogues that meet our election criteria, and that have either very negative radial velocities r very high transverse velocities, are not \u2018true\u2019 LG analogues o v erned by mutual interactions, but are systems whose kinematics re caused by other objects. It is worth noting that removing these bjects causes the \u2018true\u2019 LG analogues to have a significantly higher raction of objects within the observational uncertainties. .4 The transverse velocity nterestingly, Forero-Romero & Sierra-Porta ( 2022 ) recently reorted that the average transverse velocity of LG analogues is igher in simulations with large box sizes, pointing to a limitation f studying LG analogues in relatively small volume simulations. he largest simulation they consider, ABACUS SUMMIT , has a box ize almost identical to UCHUU , albeit at eight times lower mass esolution. Interestingly, they find a transverse velocity with a median nd 1 \u03c3 -equi v alent uncertainty of 105 + 94 \u221259 km s\n\u22121 , significantly higher han our results: v t = 81 + 74 \u221246 km s \u22121 for all LG analogues, and t = 72 + 65 \u221240 km s \u22121 for true pairs. If we further incorporate the bserved values and uncertainties on r and v r as priors, we obtain a early identical weighted posterior of v t = 75 + 65 \u221240 km s \u22121 for the LG ransv erse v elocity, consistent with the value of v t = 57 + 35 \u221231 km s \u22121 f van der Marel et al. ( 2019 ). The difference between our result and those of Forero-Romero & ierra-Porta ( 2022 ) could be partly due to the fact that their selection f haloes with v max = 200. . . 260 km s \u22121 led them to consider more assive LG analogues which, as we will discuss in Section 6.4 , tend o have higher transverse velocities. Perhaps more significantly, due\nNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\no the fact that they include pairs with separations up to 1.5 Mpc, their ample almost certainly contains a large fraction of unbound pairs, r pairs whose kinematics are not determined internally, but through nteractions with other haloes. For example, we find v t = 118 + 82 \u221268 m s \u22121 for tidally subdominant pairs, and v t = 107 + 78 \u221259 km s \u22121 for airs with high force ratios. Both of these are close to the value btained by Forero-Romero & Sierra-Porta ( 2022 ). Ho we v er, the y ay not be a good prior for the transverse velocity of the LG.\nT H E LG MASS V I A GAUSSI AN PROCESS EGRESSI ON\ne estimate the mass of the LG, M LG = M MW + M M31 , using aussian process regression (GPR), a machine learning algorithm hat provides an estimate of both the most likely value, and the ncertainty (standard deviation) of the estimate. Specifically, we nfer the relationship between the inputs (kinematics) and the target LG mass), i.e. the conditional mass distribution given the observed inematics. GPR is a type of supervised machine learning, meaning that it first learns\u2019 the connection between the input and the target variables rom a given dataset where both are known. In our case, the regressor earns the correlation between the kinematics (input) and the LG mass target) from sets of \u2018true\u2019 LG analogues from the UCHUU simulation. fterwards, the trained regressor can predict the LG mass from a i ven ne w set of kinematics. During the training, functions are fitted o the training data, whose coefficients are optimized iteratively.\nithout further constraints, there is an infinite number of possible unctions that can fit a given set of data. This sets GPR, as a form of on-parametric regression, apart from parametric regression models, here the functional form is fixed, and only function parameters are ptimized. The goal of the regression is to find a probability distribution of ll functions that fit the data, and from that, predict both the mean nd variance of the mass for a given set of kinematics, over the ntire range of possible input values. In our case, we construct the ossible functions as the dot products (inner product) of a radial basis\nFigure 6. LG mass measured in the simulation (symbol edges) and mean predicted mass using Gaussian regression (symbol centres) as a function of the observed kinematics, for a random subset of T dom , F < 0 . 5 LG analogues.

The regression correctly captures both the o v erall mass gradients detectable by eye, as well as, in many cases, the masses of apparent outliers.\nf w S b d t I i\nG v s p c i k t i\n5\nT u f o p t S n M 3 T o w o\nt m m o\nFigure 7.

The black horizontal lines indicate the median of the values plotted for each sample size, and upwards and downwards triangles indicate \u00b11 \u03c3 scatter. As the number of points in the sample increases, the scatter in the predictions is reduced.

The re gression be gins ith a uniform prior on the probabilities of all possible functions. ubsequently, the probability distribution is successively updated ased on new information in the form of training data. The posterior istribution of the possible function is then used to predict both he mean and the variance (or standard deviation) (Wang 2020 ). n this work, we use the SCIKIT-LEARN (Pedregosa et al. 2011 ) mplementation of GPR, GAUSSIANPROCESSREGRESSOR . Fig. 6 shows the mean prediction of the LG mass obtained via PR (symbol centres) in the r \u2212 v r plane (left panel), and in the r \u2212 t plane (right panel), compared to the values measured for the same ystems in the simulation (symbol edges). It can be seen that the GPR redicts the gradients in mass identifiable by eye, but also, in many ases, correctly predicts the masses of points that appear as outliers n each individual 2D plane, due to the fact that it uses the full, 3D inematic information in its estimate. Ho we ver, as demonstrated by he data points with differing edge- and centre colours, the regression s not perfect. .1 Predicted uncertainty he algorithmic complexity of GPR of O( N 3 ) prohibits us from sing the full data for training. Ho we ver, GPR is quite ef ficient e ven or small sample sizes. In Fig. 7 , we show the convergence behaviour f the regression. We train the regressor multiple times on N s data oints, and for each instance, we obtain an independent estimate of he LG mass via Monte-Carlo sampling of the observations (see ection 5.2 ). The precision of the regression increases with the umber of data points: for a sample size of N s = 100, we find LG = 3.14 \u00b1 0.27 \u00d7 10 12 M , while for a sample size of N s =\n200, we find a median value of M LG = 3.18 \u00b1 0.06 \u00d7 10 12 M . he uncertainty of \u00b10.06 \u00d7 10 12 M represents the uncertainty of ur prediction of the median value of the LG mass distribution. As e explain belo w, ho we ver, it is quite different from the uncertainty f our prediction of the mass of the LG. In Fig. 8 , we plot the predicted mass as a function of mass in he simulation, with symbols coloured, as in Fig. 9 , according to the ass in the simulation in the symbol centres, and according to the ean prediction at the symbol edges. It can be seen that the range f mean predictions is narrower than the range in the simulations:\nhe ensemble of mean predictions lacks both the high- and low-mass utliers found in the simulation. The mean prediction underpredicts he mass of the most massiv e objects, and o v erpredicts the masses for he least massive ones. This behaviour is not unexpected: indeed, if he connection between kinematics and mass contains some amount f random scatter, the extremely low- and high-mass points are ikely to fall, respectively, on the low- and high-mass side of the catter. While the mean regression cannot, by definition, reproduce he random behaviour for individual objects, we can account for the resence of scatter by including a white noise term in the kernel unction.\nOne key advantage of the Gaussian regression over some other egression models (such as decision trees or neural networks) is that t automatically provides an estimate of the uncertainty, or error, of ach estimate along with the mean estimate.

The top panel shows the results for all LG analogues in the tidally dominant, F < 0 . 5 sample. The bottom panel shows the results for only those LG analogues that are within \u00b13 \u03c3 for each of the kinematic variables on which the prediction is based, r , v r , and v t . It can be seen that the distributions of mean predictions are more concentrated than those of the simulation data, lacking both high- and low-mass outliers. By contrast, after convolving the predicted means with the predicted uncertainties, the distribution of the data is reproduced well. This effect is particularly pronounced when, as shown in the bottom panel, the range of input variables is narrowed, in this case to \u00b13 \u03c3 , where \u03c3 is the default observational uncertainty.\nu t s S s o\nu u e d e o l t t a t\ns\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/4/4863/7084035 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\n\u03c3 -uncertainties for each data points as vertical lines in Fig. 8 . The ange of values within the uncertainties around the mean predictions hown in Fig. 8 extends beyond that of the mean values alone. For full prediction that encapsulates both the predicted trend and the rreducible uncertainty, we therefore convolve each predicted mean ith a normal distribution of the predicted standard deviations. In Fig. 9 , we compare the distribution of LG masses measured irectly in the simulation with those obtained by applying the aussian regression to the kinematics measured in the simulations or the same objects. On the top panel, the open histogram shows he full data in the tidally dominant, F < 0 . 5 sample, i.e. the true\u2019 LG analogues. The red histogram shows the distribution of ean predictions of the regression, while the blue histogram shows he distribution after convolution of the predicted means with the redicted uncertainties. As discussed abo v e, the mean predictions do ot fully account for the scatter, but after the uncertainty is taken into ccount, the resulting distribution reproduces the shape of the data. n the bottom panel, the data are reduced to the subset for which each bservable, r , v r , and v t , is limited to \u00b13 \u03c3 around the observational alue, where \u03c3 is the quoted observational error. Here, the difference etween the distribution of masses in the data and in the distribution f mean predictions is even more pronounced: while the distribution f the mean predictions has M LG = 3 . 4 + 0 . 3 \u22120 . 2 \u00d7 10 12 M , the data have LG = 3 . 5 + 1 . 2 \u22121 . 1 \u00d7 10 12 , a similar median, but much greater scatter. fter convolution with the predicted uncertainty, the prediction has LG = 3 . 4 + 1 . 3 \u22120 . 9 \u00d7 10 12 M , reproducing well both the median and the catter in the data.\n.2 A prediction of the LG mass\no predict the mass of the actual LG based on our regression, we se the observed values of r , v r , and v t as inputs to the regressor rained on the simulation data. In Fig. 10 , we show the resulting robability density for the LG mass. To account for the observational\nNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\nncertainty, we create Monte-Carlo samples for 10 6 combinations of he observables, each following a normal distribution with mean and tandard deviations inferred from the observations, as described in ection 3.1 . We truncate the Monte Carlo samples to exclude nonensical values, i.e. r < 0 or v t < 0, but this has only a minor effect n the results. The thick red line in Fig. 10 shows the resulting mass distribution sing the mean values of the regressor with the quoted observational ncertainties. The predicted mass is 3 . 43 + 0 . 1 \u22120 . 2 \u00d7 10 12 M \u2013 an apparntly impressively precise result. As indicated by the dashed and otted red lines, the precision is limited only by the observational rrors: the uncertainty increases to \u00b10.3 \u00d7 10 12 M when the bservational errors are assumed to be twice as high (dashed red ine) and becomes infinitesimally small when the assumed errors go o zero (dotted vertical line). Notably, as we will show in Section 6 , his behaviour is similar to an analysis based on the classical \u2018timing rgument\u2019. Ho we ver, it is not a true reflection of the uncertainty of he estimate of the mass based on the kinematics.\nThe blue lines in Fig. 10 show, for the same Monte Carlo amples with the same assumed observational uncertainties, the\nFigure 10. LG mass predicted by the Gaussian regression, when using Monte Carlo samples of the observed kinematics within the stated uncertainties as inputs. The red lines show the distribution of the mean predictions, and the blue lines show the distribution after convolving each mean prediction with its associated uncertainty. It can be seen that the mean prediction appears to be very precise, but this belies the true uncertainty in the LG mass\u2013kinematics relation. Only after convolving with the uncertainties, we get a realistic estimate, and find a mass of 3 . 2 + 1 . 2 \u22120 . 9 \u00d7 10 12 M when assuming standard \u00b11 \u03c3 observational errors. While the uncertainty of the mean prediction depends strongly on the assumed observational errors (dotted lines: zero error, solid lines: the default errors, dashed lines: twice the default errors), the uncertainty of the convolved prediction is dominated by the uncertainty in the kinematics\u2013 mass relation.\nL t o k w a\nr c t r t l\n6 E\nT m u a e a r\nk\n\u03c3\nw a\nr\nP\nw d c o\nm x a\n( t\nF ( ( F 1\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/4/4863/7084035 by Indian Institute of\nG mass distribution after the predicted means are convolved with he predicted uncertainties.

For this purpose, we consider ach LG analogue as a measurement of the observed LG, weighted ccording to a Gaussian kernel which describes the likelihood that it epresents the observations.\nFor each LG analogue, i , we compute the distance to the observed inematics as\ni = \u221a\n\u03c3 2 r,i + \u03c3 2 v r ,i + \u03c3 2 v t ,i , (2) here \u03c3 x , i = ( x i \u2212 x obs )/ \u03c3 x , obs , with x obs the mean observed value,\nnd \u03c3 x , obs the associated error, respectively, for each x in r , v r , v t . We then compute the relative probability that an LG analogue, i , epresents the observations as\ni = 1 (2 \u03c0 ) n/ 2 e \u2212\u03c3 2 i / 2 , (3)\nhere n is the number of independent observables and \u03c3 i is as efined in equation ( 2 ). We use these probabilities as weights in omputing the probability distributions of the posteriors given by the bservables. When we include additional constraints, such as the observed ass of the MW or M31, we include these as additional observables, , and compute the associated distances, \u03c3 i , and probabilities, P i , ccordingly.\nIn Fig. 11 , we show the distributions of the kinematic properties v r and r on the left, v t and r on the right) of LG analogues, with he colour hue according to the LG mass (as in Figs 3 and 4 , and the\nMNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\n), and as a function of r and v t (right column).

In Fig. 12 , we show the histograms of the distributions of kinematic ariables of LG analogues, weighed using the Gaussian distance in erms of r , v r , and v t . It can be seen that, for r and v r , both the median alues and the standard deviations of the distributions are very close o the assumed observational values. This reflects the fact that the elati ve observ ational errors are so small that the distributions of v r nd r among the simulated LG analogues o v er these intervals are lose to uniform. As discussed abo v e, the observational uncertainty f v t is considerably larger, and given that v t is bounded from below y zero, the resulting distribution is asymmetric and skewed slightly owards higher values. .1 Kinematically deri v ed probability distributions n Fig. 13 , we show the distributions of all four covariants, obtained sing a probability weighted average: the total mass (top left), the ass ratio (top right), the lower of the two masses (bottom left), nd the greater of the two masses (bottom right). On each panel, we how both the distribution for the full set of LG analogues, and for he subset of analogues that are both tidally dominant and with a low orce ratio (true pairs).\nFor these \u2018true pairs\u2019, we find a total mass of M LG = 3 . 45 + 1 . 09 \u22121 . 12 \u00d7 0 12 M . Both the centre of the distribution and the uncertainty are ery similar to the result obtained in Section 5 using GPR. We find mass of M 2 = 0 . 9 + 0 . 58 \u22120 . 30 \u00d7 10 12 M for the lower mass halo, and 1 = 2 . 33 + 1 . 00 \u22120 . 85 \u00d7 10 12 M for the higher mass halo. The median total mass is considerably lower than most of he estimates using the timing argument. Notably, both individal masses and their uncertainties are consistent with the indeendent mass estimates for the MW and M31 listed discussed n Section 2 , at least if the MW is the less massive of the air. We explore the mass-order in more detail in the next ection.\nNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\nIt is also worth noting that the most likely (modal) mass of the ower mass halo, M 2 , is near the lower limit of the mass range, .5 \u00d7 10 12 M . This is a consequence of the steep mass function n CDM, and the fact that the kinematics constrain only the total\nass, on which the lower mass halo has a comparatively small effect. s mentioned in Section 3.1 , the lower limit on M 1 that we selected ust be considered as an additional prior.\n.2 Comparison to the timing argument\nn Fig. 14 , we show the probability distribution function for the robability-weighted estimate of M LG , the mass of the LG. The ark blue solid line shows the result we obtain using the \u00b11 \u03c3 ncertainties described in Section 3.1 , r = 765 \u00b1 11 kpc, v r = 09.3 \u00b1 4.4 km s \u22121 , and v t = 57 \u00b1 35 km s \u22121 . The light blue dashed ine shows the result if we instead increase all observational errors y a factor of 2: r = 765 \u00b1 22 kpc, v r = 109.3 \u00b1 8.8 km s \u22121 , and t = 57 \u00b1 70 km s \u22121 . Confirming the results obtained through GPR iscussed in Section 5 , the distribution function for the LG mass is lmost unchanged. The true uncertainty in the mass of the LG is not imited by the observational errors in r , v r , or v t , but by the scatter in he kinematics\u2013mass relation, i.e. the scatter in mass of objects with dentical kinematics.\nThe other four lines in Fig. 14 show the results of applying the iming argument, either to the kinematics of the probability weighted G analogues in the simulation (red lines), or to Monte Carlo samples f the observations (grey lines). We compute timing argument masses y numerically solving the following four equations (Marel & uhathakurta 2008 ), where a is the semimajor axis of the MW-M31 rbit, e is the eccentricity, and \u03b7 is the eccentric anomaly (which arametrizes the orbital phase). The parameters r , v r , and v t are the eparation, radial, and transverse velocities, respectively, and t 0 is he age of the Universe.\n= a ( 1 \u2212 e cos \u03b7) , (4)\n0 = ( a 3\nGM\n)1 / 2 ( \u03b7 \u2212 e sin \u03b7) , (5)\nFigure 13. Clockwise from the top left: posterior distributions of the total mass (M LG , top left), mass of the more massive halo (M 1 , top right), mass of the less massive halo (M 2 , bottom right), and mass ratio (M M31 /M MW , bottom left), when each LG analogue either from the full sample (purple lines) or the sample fulfilling the tidal dominance and force ratio criteria (dark blue lines) is weighted according to its likelihood to represent the observed LG, and assuming that M31 is the more massive of the pair. The shaded areas indicate the ranges between the 16th and 84th percentiles. Using this weighted sample, we obtain a median total mass of 3.43 \u00d7 10 12 M , and a median MW mass of 0.90 \u00d7 10 12 M , in line with the observations. We also obtain a median M31 mass of 2.33 \u00d7 10 12 M and a median mass ratio of 2.28.\nv\nv\na C c ( f t s s t a t s r a\nm s\n6\nG i i L a u m a\nc a o t s\nl \u2018\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/4/4863/7084035 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nr = ( GM a )1 / 2 e sin \u03b7 1 \u2212 e cos \u03b7 , (6) t = ( GM a )1 / 2 (1 \u2212 e 2 ) 1 / 2 1 \u2212 e cos \u03b7 . (7)\nNote that the timing argument only applies to bound LG analogues nd assumes that the LG is on its first approach. Both for the Monte arlo samples and for the probability weighted kinematics, we also ompute the distributions using either the quoted \u00b11 \u03c3 uncertainty solid lines), or increasing all assumed observational errors by a actor of 2 (dashed lines). By comparing the grey and red lines, we see hat the probability weighted kinematics of the LG analogues in the imulations closely match the Monte Carlo samples, resulting in very imilar distributions for the timing argument mass. By comparing he solid and dashed lines, we see that the precision of the timing rgument estimate increases for smaller assumed errors. Indeed, if he observed errors tend to zero, the timing argument yields a unique olution. Ho we ver, this does not reflect the true uncertainty in the elation between mass and kinematics measured in the simulations, s shown by the blue lines. We also note that the timing argument\nasses are offset from those measured directly in the simulations, uggesting that the timing argument is biassed.\n.3 The MW mass as an additional prior\niven the spate of recent measurements of the MW mass, we also nvestigate the dependence of LG properties when the MW mass s imposed as an additional constraint. The results are not purely G kinematic estimates, and cannot be used directly to reveal (or lleviate) tensions between individual estimates and those obtained sing pure kinematics. Ho we v er, the y may pro vide more accurate ass estimates, and a comparison to the purely kinematic results can lso illuminate whether the different mass estimates are compatible. As discussed in the introduction, the mass of the MW is very well onstrained to be close to 10 12 M using Gaia DR3 observations, mong others. Assuming a value of 1 . 1 + 0 . 2 \u22120 . 2 \u00d7 10 12 M as a fourth bservable in equations ( 2 ) and 3 , we obtain new distributions for he masses of the individual objects, and for the mass of the LG, as hown in Fig. 15 .\nWe consider both the case where the MW, at this mass, is the ess massive or more massive halo of the pair. The first scenario, regular mass order\u2019, is shown by the dark blue lines in Fig. 15 . As-\nMNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\nM\nFigure 14. Probability distribution of the LG mass.

Using he measured MW mass as an additional observational constraint has ncreased the accuracy of the predictions for all three components. nder the assumption that the MW is the less massive of the pair, an W mass of 1 . 1 + 0 . 2 \u22120 . 2 \u00d7 10 12 is not in conflict with the LG kinematics. o the contrary, the MW mass is slightly abo v e the median value nferred purely from kinematics. When the MW is assumed to be the more massive of the two haloes orange lines in Fig. 15 ), the three other results change significantly. he total mass of the LG is reduced to 1 . 90 + 0 . 39 \u22120 . 31 \u00d7 10 12 M , while he mass of M31 is now 0 . 73 + 0 . 28 \u22120 . 16 \u00d7 10 12 M , and the mass raio is M MW / M M31 = 1 . 48 + 0 . 48 \u22120 . 34 ( M M31 / M MW = 0 . 68 + 0 . 2 \u22120 . 17 ). All these re outside the range predicted from the kinematics alone. The trong preference for an M31 mass below 10 12 M and a total ass below 2 \u00d7 10 12 M despite the kinematics in this \u2018inverted ass ordering\u2019 stem from the fact that mass ratios very close to :1 are rare. The probability density functions shown in Fig. 15 show the stimated values of the masses and mass ratio given the assumed inematics, and under the assumptions that an MW of 1 . 1 + 0 . 2 \u22120 . 2 \u00d7 10 12 s either the less or more massive halo of the pair. They do not, y themselves, predict which assumption for the mass ordering is ore likely to be correct. To estimate the relative probability for a re gular\u2019 or \u2018inv erted\u2019 mass order giv en the observ ed kinematics and\nNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\nheir associated uncertainties, we compare the sum of the weighted robability densities for both scenarios, which also accounts for the ass function and mass ratio distribution in the simulations. We nd a ratio of 3.6, implying a 78 per cent chance that an MW of . 1 + 0 . 2 \u22120 . 2 \u00d7 10 12 is less massive than M31.\n.4 The inverse problem: possible kinematics for a given mass\nhe kinematics strongly constrain the mass of the LG, but among the .4 million LG analogues, we find examples of LGs with any mass n the range 1\u201310 \u00d7 10 12 M for nearly every combination of the inematics. Part of the preference for a low-mass system is simply ue to the fact that in CDM, low-mass haloes and by extension alo pairs, are far more pre v alent than high-mass haloes. It may herefore be illuminating to also consider the inverse question: given n assumed LG mass, what is the range of plausible kinematics?\nIn Fig. 16 , we show the distributions of the kinematics for LG nalogues with masses of \u223c2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 \u00d7 10 12 M . Each ass range is limited to \u00b10.2 \u00d7 10 12 M , small enough to clearly eparate different mass ranges, and large enough to include at least 0 4 systems in each mass range. Also shown are ellipses centred on the observed values and xtending to the \u00b11 \u03c3 observational uncertainty. We find that the ombination of separation, r , and transv erse v elocity, v t , does not ufficiently discriminate between different masses o v er this interval. nterestingly, this is not only due to the large observational error, ut also due to the fact that the 1 \u03c3 scatter in v t ranges from 20\u201390 km s \u22121 at M = 2 \u00d7 10 12 M to \u223c40\u2013150 km s \u22121 at M = \u00d7 10 12 M . Each mass range includes a significant o v erlap with he observed value and uncertainty, and v t values as high as 125 m s \u22121 are not uncommon for LG masses of up to 4 \u00d7 10 12 M . igher mass pairs tend to have greater v t values, which in addition o the effects mentioned in Section 4.3 may partly explain the higher alue reported by Forero-Romero & Sierra-Porta ( 2022 ), and values s high as 110 km s \u22121 can certainly not be ruled out. Only a value f v t as high as 164 km s \u22121 , as suggested by Salomon et al. ( 2016 ), s disfa v oured (under 5 per cent probability in combination with he observations of r and v r ) if the LG mass is not in excess of \u00d7 10 12 M . By contrast, the combination of separation, r , and radial velocity\nr , strongly depends on the mass. For LG analogues analogues with asses of 2 \u00d7 10 12 M and a separation of \u223c770 kpc, the magnitude\nf the observed radial velocity is 2 \u03c3 above the median, while for G analogues of 6 \u00d7 10 12 M , it is 1.2 \u03c3 below the median. The bserved kinematics are most likely to occur for LG analogues of ust under 4 \u00d7 10 12 M . Ho we ver, the fact that low-mass LGs are ore common (and, to a smaller e xtent, the relativ ely low transverse elocity) pushes the most likely LG mass down to \u223c3.3 \u00d7 10 12 M .\nC O N C L U S I O N\ne have inferred the halo masses of the MW and M31, their ombined mass, and mass ratio, by analysing kinematically selected G analogues from the UCHUU cosmological simulation. To establish he relation between mass and kinematics, we distinguish between true pairs\u2019 in which the interactions between the MW and M31 ominate the gravitational force, and those whose kinematics are trongly affected by external influences. We find that this distinction ignificantly changes the distributions of kinematic variables.\nAssuming CDM, limiting the range of halo masses to 0.5\u2013 \u00d7 10 12 M , and considering only true pairs where the gravitaional field and tidal field are primarily due to the MW and M31\nFigure 15. Distributions of the total mass, mass of M31, mass of the MW, and the mass ratio, measured in the simulation with each LG analogue weighed according to its likelihood to represent the observed LG, either assuming only the observed kinematics (grey, as the dark blue lines in Fig. 13 ), or also assuming 1 . 1 + 0 . 2 \u22120 . 2 \u00d7 10 12 M for the mass of the MW, as either the less massive of the pair (\u2018regular mass order\u2019, in blue), or the more massive of the pair (\u2018inverted mass order\u2019, in orange). The shaded areas show the regions between the 16th and 84th percentiles. Assuming that an MW of \u223c1.1 \u00d7 10 12 M is the less massive galaxy yields very similar results for the total mass, mass ratio, and mass of M31, with slightly reduced errors. By contrast, assuming an MW of \u223c1.1 \u00d7 10 12 M to be the more massive galaxy results in a much lower total mass, a much lower M31 mass, and a mass ratio much closer to unity.\nFigure 16.

In terms of v r and r , as shown on the left panel, the observed kinematics are typical for LG analogues with a mass of \u223c4 \u00d7 10 12 M , and lie just outside the 1 \u03c3 range for LG analogues with a mass of 3 \u00d7 10 12 M or 6 \u00d7 10 12 M . The scatter in v t is larger than that in v r in every mass range, and all masses are compatible with the measured v t value.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/4/4863/7084035 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nMNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\nM\nt M a\np b m c b w t a w w\no l c p 1 l m e m L t s\nu i l m h t o o M 1\nd w m r i t c o m s 2 h fl t 2\nb f a p o t s\ne t\nA\nW P f p U a\n3 A w a E F\nS t D b S s N\nC a U s s N a U s (\ni 2\nD\nT d l\ne r i n\nR\nA A B\nB C C C\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/521/4/4863/7084035 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nhemselves, our analysis using GPR results in a total mass of LG = 3 . 2 + 0 . 9 \u22121 . 2 \u00d7 10 12 M . We obtain a nearly identical result using\nprobability weighted estimate. Our result for the mass of the LG is significantly lower than most revious results which apply the timing argument to the kinematics, ut in agreement with Benisty et al. ( 2022 ), who obtain a total ass of 3.4 \u00d7 10 12 M when correcting the timing argument for osmic bias. As discussed in Section 6.4 , accounting for cosmic ias (the fact that there are more low-mass than high-mass haloes), hich is folded into our analysis, is certainly important for deermining the most likely mass. Ho we ver, it is not clear that our greement with Benisty et al. ( 2022 ) is more than incidental, and e leave a more detailed analysis of the timing argument to future ork. We find that the kinematics most strongly constrain the total mass f the pair, leaving the mass of the two haloes and their mass ratio ess well constrained. But importantly, the kinematics are not in onflict with the individual measurements. In particular, contrary to revious claims, they do not point towards a mass of the MW abo v e 0 12 M . In fact, a purely kinematic analysis gives a mass for the ess massive halo of 0 . 9 + 0 . 59 \u22120 . 31 \u00d7 10 12 M . When we assume an MW\nass of 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10 12 M as an additional prior, we also obtain ssentially the same posteriors for the total mass, M31 mass, and ass ratio, assuming that the MW is the less massive of the pair. ending strong support for the \u2018regular\u2019 mass order, if we assume hat the MW is more massive, all the distributions shift significantly, howing strong tensions with the observations.\nWe also find that LG analogues with close to equal masses are quite nlikely, and find a mass ratio of 2 . 28 + 2 . 02 \u22120 . 96 using only kinematics. It s worth noting that value and its distribution are quite sensitive to the ower bound of 5 \u00d7 10 11 M for each halo: allowing lower mass LG\nembers is bound to shift the mass ratio distribution towards even igher values, while assuming a mass of \u223c1.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10 12 M for he less massive halo gives a mass ratio of 2 . 18 + 1 . 17 \u22120 . 78 M . For the mass f the more massive halo, we find 2 . 33 + 1 . 00 \u22120 . 85 \u00d7 10 12 M based only n pair kinematics, and we find 2 . 28 + 0 . 97 \u22120 . 78 \u00d7 10 12 M for the mass of 31, assuming it is the more massive halo in an LG with an MW of .1 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10 12 M . It is worth noting that the pair kinematics only give a probability istribution for the mass of the LG. Both the GPR and our probability eighted estimate show significant tails towards higher and lower asses. To further constrain the mass (albeit forgoing the potential to eveal possible tensions), and reduce the residual scatter, additional ndependent tracers will need to be considered, which further set he LG apart from the systems we consider here, and which may ontain additional information about its mass. This may include the bserved stellar masses of the galaxies obtained through abundance atching (e.g. Guo et al. 2011 ), the presence and orbits of (massive) atellites (Tepper-Garc \u0301\u0131a, Bland-Hawthorn & Li 2020 ; Wang et al. 020 ; Benisty et al. 2022 ; Chamberlain et al. 2023 ), the assembly istories of the MW and M31, the properties of the local Hubble ow (e.g. Fattahi et al. 2016 ), and finally possibly the peculiar local opology surrounding the LG (e.g. Neuzil, Mansfield & Kravtsov 020 ; Aragon-Calvo, Silk & Neyrinck 2023 ). Importantly, the precision of our mass estimate is neither limited y statistics, nor by observational uncertainty. Instead, we find a undamental and irreducible scatter in the relation between mass nd kinematics of \u223c\u00b110 12 M . This leads us to conclude that revious works which reported a smaller uncertainty purely based n the parameters of the MW\u2013Andromeda orbit, either through the iming argument or machine learning, did not fully account for this catter. On the other hand, in order to obtain a more accurate mass\nNRAS 521, 4863\u20134877 (2023)\nstimate, future work will need to include additional information in he analysis.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank Marius Cautun, Shihong Liao, Jorge Pe \u0303 narubbia, and Kai uolam \u0308aki for insightful discussions and advice, and the referee or their careful reading of our manuscript, and in particular, for roviding directions for future work.
