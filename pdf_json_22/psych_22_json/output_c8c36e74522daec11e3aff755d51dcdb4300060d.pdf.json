Data were collected from a sample of 495 participants (aged 11\u201323 years) residing in the National Capital Region of Delhi (Delhi-NCR), using the bilingual version (Hindi and English) of the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI). Their PWI score was 80.06, indicating high happiness levels in the nonwestern normative PWI range. Domains of personal relationships, community connectedness, and safety represented high overall wellbeing with the highest mean scores. Multivariate analysis showed that the least happy group on life as a whole domain was students aged 19\u201323 years as compared with the 11\u201314 and 15\u201318 years age group. Furthermore, men had higher happiness levels on personal safety, while women had higher scores on life achievement. The qualitative analysis illustrated the socio-cultural basis of these wellbeing determinants as rooted in the hierarchical social structures and collectivistic cultural orientation.\nKEYWORDS\nPersonal Wellbeing Index (PWI), adolescent wellbeing, youth wellbeing, India, socio-cultural experiences, happiness determinants\nIntroduction\nThe World Health Organization classifies individuals aged between 10 and 24 years as \u201cyoung people\u201d [WHO Regional office for South-East Asia.(n.d.)]. This age group comprises early to late adolescence and youth which forms nearly 30.30% (\u223c373 million) of India\u2019s total population (Office of the Registrar General Census Commissioner, India, 2011). Considering their significant contribution to the population of the country and its future economic growth, their health and wellbeing are of paramount importance to the various stakeholders including policymakers and educationists.\nThe transition from adolescence to adulthood marks an important period during which an individual develops essential behavior and thinking patterns, which could determine health-related outcomes (Lawrence et al., 2009). Several studies have shown that wellbeing-related behavioral patterns established during an individual\u2019s early adolescence continue through adulthood and later life impacting their physical and mental health (Currie et al., 2009; Patton et al., 2011). Studies have reported a positive association between high levels of satisfaction and happiness with global health, goal attainment, self-esteem, social identity, and community integration, which may act as stable characteristics continuing to early adulthood. Adolescents are especially prone to environmental influences (by peers, family, and society), which act as determining\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nfactors of their wellbeing - related behaviors (Sawyer et al., 2012). For example, a study by Suar et al. (2019) predicting factors of subjective wellbeing among Indian millennials found that satisfaction with personal relationships and emotional stability positively predicted their subjective wellbeing by providing a sense of calmness and fulfilled affiliation needs.\nAmong the various multifactor wellbeing models [e.g., psychological wellbeing, Ryff and Keyes (1995); PERMA model, Seligman (2012); mental health continuum, Keyes (2002), etc.], is the Personal Wellbeing (PWB) model, under the broad and multidimensional construct of Subjective Wellbeing (SWB). SWB explores people\u2019s interpretation of their own lives (their emotions and cognitive judgments), within which PWB specifically seeks to understand the overall life satisfaction of the individual in various domains of their life. It is measured using the psychometrically robust Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), which assesses an individual\u2019s happiness in seven life domains, namely, standard of living, personal health, life achievement, personal relationships, personal safety, community connectedness, and future security, that act as first-level deconstructions of the global happiness measure: \u201clife as a whole\u201d (Lau et al., 2005).\nExploring an individual\u2019s wellbeing through the lens of socio-demographic and cultural determinants, the 2009/2010 HBSCWHO survey reported that the socio-demographic factors such as age and gender have been under-researched with regard to young people\u2019s wellbeing (Currie et al., 2009). A study by Singh et al. (2015a) found an age-related decline in levels of PWB among adolescents in India as they advanced from early to late adolescence. Similar results have been reported in Australian and Spanish adolescent samples (Tomyn et al., 2015; Tomyn and Cummins, 2011). However, the evidence on the association of age with various domains of personal wellbeing in India is limited. With regards to gender differences, different results have been found across various regions and cultures, for instance, Singh et al. (2015a) reported PWB to be higher in men than women, particularly in the PWI domains of personal safety and life achievement among the North Indian adolescent population. However, Daraei (2013) found no gender differences in the psychological wellbeing of young adults in a sample of Indian undergraduate students in Mysore city. Therefore, further research is needed to build more evidence and investigate the relation between sociodemographics and wellbeing.\nAlongside socio-demographic factors, the cultural context of an individual also forms an integral part of their wellbeing (Diener et al., 2003). India is a highly collectivistic nation where most individuals define themselves through group goals, a \u201cwe\u201d rather than \u201cI\u201d perspective. As collectivists, individuals in India value collaboration and constructive interdependence resulting in greater group harmony, security, and good social relationships, which form valued\nsocial constructs (Biswas-Diener et al., 2012). Research on happiness in collectivistic nations has shown that cultural norms predict the wellbeing of individuals. For example, a large study conducted by Suh et al. (1998) in 61 nations among more than 62,000 people showed that cultural norms strongly predicted life satisfaction among individuals in collectivistic nations. In another study, individuals with a collectivistic orientation show higher affective wellbeing at work (Rego and Cunha, 2009). In India, preliminary research has shown that sacrificing personal goals for group belongingness and other collectivistic themes such as relationship orientation and belief in the hierarchy may promote an individual\u2019s happiness (Biswas-Diener et al., 2012). It thus becomes imperative to study the trends and associations of wellbeing indicators in the specific cultural context of people in India.\nThe use of the native vernacular of a culture to understand the contextual nuances of a construct cannot be disputed. The issue of cultural meanings getting \u201clost in translation\u201d has been depicted by some wellbeing scholars (e.g., M\u00f8ller et al., 2015). For a detailed cultural understanding of the vernacular and socio-cultural nuances of wellbeing, qualitative research has proven to be a beneficial tool. For example, M\u00f8ller et al. (2015) conducted focus group discussions in South Africa to investigate themeaning of the isiXhosa version of PWI depicting the wellbeing experiences of natives. Similar in-depth descriptive studies have been performed in other cultural contexts (e.g., Wiens et al., 2014; Thin, 2018).\nIn the Indian cultural context, a recent growing body of qualitative research has been conducted exploring the sociocultural meaning of subjective wellbeing and happiness among children (Exenberger et al., 2019), among at-risk youth with traumatic life experiences (Exenberger and Reiber, 2020), and college students (Singh and Bandyopadhyay, 2022). However, qualitative research on the personal wellbeing indicators to understand the contextual nuances of wellbeing among adolescents and youth is still lacking in the Indian cultural context. Therefore, one of the main objectives of this study was to bridge this gap and examine through a qualitative study, the culture-specific trends in personal wellbeing among Indian adolescents and youth (aged 10\u201324 years as per the WHO classification).\nGiven this, this study employed a parallel mixed method\ndesign with the following aims:\n(1) To quantitatively examine the level of personal wellbeing\nin a sample of Indian adolescents and youth and explore the demographic differences (age and gender-related) across the PWI domains. (2) To develop a rich understanding of the facilitators and\ninhibitors of personal wellbeing among Indian adolescents and youth by studying their experiences using in-depth qualitative analysis.\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org"

The bilingual translated version was reported to be a reliable and valid instrument formeasuring PWI among children and adolescents in India, yielding a Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of 0.74, with a one-factor solution accounting for 41.29% of the variance and a moderate model fit. The scale items in the bilingual version were identical to the original scale and additionally provide space for qualitative responses after each question. Since a forced-choice question format restricts an indepth exploration of the construct and limits the respondent to a set of options (e.g., rating 0\u201310), using an open-ended response format helped us capture the subjective perceptions of the respondents. Tomyn et al. (2013) studied the psychometric equivalence of the child and adult versions of the PWI, i.e., the PWI-SC and the PWI-A, and reported that they measure similar underlying constructs."

Participants were informed that their participation was voluntary, and they were free to withdraw from the research at any stage. They were also made aware that the results would be used only for research purposes, and confidentiality of data would be strictly maintained. The students were briefed about the study verbally, and a data collection booklet comprising the assent/consent form, a demographic information sheet, and the bilingual PWI form (each word/sentence written in Hindi and English languages) were distributed to them in the classroom. The participants were asked to respond to the PWI using the 0\u201310 scale and encouraged to elaborate on their responses. Therefore, both quantitative and qualitative data were obtained during data collection. The bilingual format is readily employed in India for all official government and private purposes, providing the participants with ease to write responses on the PWI scale in any language they were comfortable with. Any doubts that the participants had were clarified."

(Singh et al., 2015a) found that the domains of standard of living, community belongingness, personal health, and achievement in life predicted happiness with life as a whole among Indian adolescents, which were the top-ranked domains constituting the facilitators of happiness among young people in our sample. Similarly, other studies conducted with Chinese and Australian adolescent samples found that living standards, personal relations, and life achievement domains predicted happiness with life as a whole (Lau et al., 2005). Demographically, the age-related differences that we found were consistent with the Romanian population where Baltatescu and Cummins (2006) reported higher levels of PWI among highschool students than university students, demonstrating that the cross-cultural determinants overlap on the global PWI measure. A similar age-related decline over the lifespan has also been reported for subjective wellbeing in multiple studies and populations, e.g., Chinese (Xing and Huang, 2014) and\nBritish (Clark and Oswald, 2006) populations, demonstrating that age-related differences in wellbeing may show a similar picture across cultures. This could be true for gender differences in wellbeing as well, where similar to our findings, a survey in 60 nations found that younger women reported higher levels of overall life satisfaction than youngmen (Inglehart, 2002). Higher happiness with life as a whole has also been reported in female Spanish adolescent samples (Casas et al., 2012).\nInterestingly, responses on nonmonetary happiness by young people in the sample depicting the importance of family belongingness were synonymous with the findings of another study in Chile, on family support, and PWB among school students. They found that intangible and social support from family was positively related to happiness in life (Schnettler et al., 2015). In a collectivistic culture such as India, the importance of family values, such as cooperation and harmony, and bonds are further exemplified by the preference of \u201cWe\u201d over \u201cI,\u201d thus positively impacting wellbeing (Mosquera, 2015). Our participants\u2019 responses on improving personal relationships by learning from past mistakes provided insight into the strong meaning of relationships in a student\u2019s life, making the domain of family belongingness one of the best-understood items.\nAnother observation to note was that the participants largely used \u201ccommunity connectedness\u201d interchangeably with \u201cbelongingness with the family.\u201d M\u00f8ller et al. (2015) conducted focus group discussions on PWI in South Africa where they also reported \u201ccommunity connectedness\u201d as a problematic item, which resonated responses with the personal relationship domain. This discrepancy in the current sample may reflect conceptual issues with language where the questionnaire term \u201cdoing things away from home\u201d might have been culturally misunderstood.\nResponses on belongingness with the community highlighted the need to inculcate the value of social work among students. Government programs such as the \u201cNational Service Scheme (NSS)\u201d instill the value of community work and collaboration and might be a step in this direction. In a similar vein, recent research on happiness in India has identified strategies to enhance the happiness levels of people, identifying a greater need for engagement of people in voluntary social services (Bhattacharyya et al., 2019).\nMoving on, we found age-related differences in wellbeing. School-going adolescents (aged 11\u201318) ranked personal relationships and life achievement higher, while college-going students (aged 19\u201323) ranked personal safety and standard of living higher. This depicts that the differential social needs are based on the developmental challenges among these population cohorts.\nQualitative responses on the domain of personal safety seemed to be demographically unanimous. Although men had higher wellbeing than women on personal safety, their responses consisted of similar safety concerns as enlisted women. However, adolescent men reported their wellbeing to be higher on\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\npersonal safety than women, which has been well documented in previous literature (e.g., Casas et al., 2012; May, 2001). This can be explained by the social environment of the participants in India.With 17,000 reported incidents of crime against women in Delhi, which is projected to reach 28,000 in 2020 (Dwivedi and Sachdeva, 2019), the city is surely not safe for women. Incidents of serious violence, physical abuse, and rape have been rampant with few internationally notorious gruesome rape cases. In such a situation, it is slightly satisfactory that the qualitative responses of women in the sample pointed to feel safe at their home, which is usually also not immune to such crimes.\nThe PWI score of this study (80.06) falls on the high end of the normative score range of both western and nonwestern samples representing high happiness levels among the young people of Delhi-NCR. Consistent with our findings, Singh et al. (2015a) reported high mean PWI scores (76.4-87.2) among 13- 18-year-old Indian students. The western PWI normative score range is 70-80 points (e.g., The Australian Wellbeing Index Report, 2018, PWI: 75.1; International Wellbeing Group, 2013). It has been reported by researchers that the PWI score range of Asian countries is generally 10 points lower than western normative scores including studies from China (e.g., Chen and Davey, 2009, PWI: 64.4), Hong-Kong (Lau et al., 2005, PWI: 65.9), and Thailand (Yiengprugsawan et al., 2010, PWI: 75.7). These high scores reported by the study could perhaps be because the sample is representative of an urban setting (DelhiNCR) where resources are more readily available than other areas in India affecting their wellbeing experiences. Consistent with the present research findings, another study from DelhiNCR by (Singh et al., 2015b) upheld the view that slightly more Indians were flourishing and less languishing compared with the other groups such as the US and South African youths. Therefore, replicating our study in different parts of India would better ascertain the normative PWI score range among Indian adolescents and youth.\nComparison of wellbeing ratings with other nonwestern samples shows similar findings with regards to the domains of personal relationships and safety, which were among the highest ranked items and future security ranked among the lowest by many Asian cohorts including samples from Zhuhai, Hong Kong, and Macau (Chen and Davey, 2009). In their research on the optimal level of wellbeing, Oishi et al. (2009) explored the nuances of a high level of happiness (those in the top 10% of happiness scores on a wellbeing measure). Utilizing the World Values Survey Data, they found that a slightly lower level of happiness was associated with the most academic and financial success. A high level of happiness was associated with success in close personal relationships. This study lends support to this finding, wherein 79% of those who reported a score of \u201c10\u201d on the global PWI domain (169 participants) regarded personal relationships (family support and belongingness) as an essential facilitator of happiness.\nUsing the internationally recognized PWI tool, this study captured the wellbeing experiences among young people of Delhi-NCR. The analysis of the data was conducted robustly by researchers and discussed in detail so as not to let any personal biases confound this study. Using the survey as a methodology, a large geographical area was reached in the cosmopolitan capital city of Delhi-NCR, and holistic accounts of wellbeing were captured. The use of the psychometrically valid bilingual PWI scale made it possible for the participants to answer with ease enhancing their conceptual understanding of the questions.\nWe recognized a few limitations to the study as well. Although survey methodology is an effective tool to research a large geographical population, its effectiveness is limited by short responses. Interactive interview sessions or focus group discussions might have captured in-depth responses on wellbeing. Another shortcoming that limits the generalizability of the present results is the nature of the sample, as data were primarily collected from middle and upper-class residents of an urban North Indian city. Future studies can use face-toface interviews and focus group discussions with a more diverse sample. Such studies may also qualitatively explore gender and age-related differences or similarities in the conceptualization of personal wellbeing and its determinants among Indians, thereby addressing another shortcoming of the present research. Another possibility for future research in the area can be to quantitatively explore the relationship between personal wellbeing and sociodemographic variables such as caste, socioeconomic status, religion, stream or course of study, or type of school or college. These variables can affect the personal wellbeing of youth (e.g., Achour et al., 2015). Thus, the experiences of wellbeing among young people need to be documented from other subpopulations within India.\nIn brief, the take-home message from this research is that this study supports and validates the findings of existing research on the personal wellbeing of adolescents and youth in India. It depicts the importance of the cultural background of the individual when examining wellbeing in the Indian cultural context. There is a need to conduct research on personal wellbeing in different regions of India to holistically understand the culture-specific trends in personal wellbeing."
