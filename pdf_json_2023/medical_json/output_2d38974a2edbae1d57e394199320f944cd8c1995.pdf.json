            "text": "Cornified envelopes (CEs) of human epidermis ordinarily consist of transglutaminase-mediated crosslinked proteins and are essential for skin barrier function. However, in addition to enzyme-mediated isopeptide bonding, protein cross-linking could also arise from oxidative damage. Our group recently demonstrated abnormal incorporation of cellular proteins into CEs by pro-oxidants in woodsmoke. In this study, we focused on 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ), mesquite liquid smoke (MLS), and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), to further understand the mechanisms through which environmental pro-oxidants induce CE formation and alter the CE proteome. CEs induced by the ionophore X537A were used for comparison. Similar to X537A, DMNQ- and MLS-induced CE formation was associated with membrane permeabilization. However, since DMNQ is non-adduct forming, its CEs were similar in protein profile to those from X537A. By contrast, MLS, rich in reactive carbonyls that can form protein adducts, caused a dramatic change in the CE proteome. TCDD-CEs were found to contain many CE precursors, such as small proline-rich proteins and late cornified envelope proteins, encoded by the epidermal differentiation complex. Since expression of these proteins is mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and its well-known target protein, CYP1A1, was exclusively present in the TCDD group, we suggest that TCDD alters the CE proteome through persistent AhR activation. This study demonstrates the potential of environmental pro-oxidants to alter the epidermal CE proteome and indicates that the cellular redox state has an important role in CE formation."

            "text": "Skin is the first line of defense against external threats. It quenches reactive oxygen species (ROS),\nabsorbs ultraviolet light radiation, prevents pathogen infiltration, and limits water and electrolyte loss from the body (Elias 2005; Vermeij et al. 2011). The skin barrier is established by terminally differentiated keratinocytes, also known as corneocytes. These are dead cells filled with keratins and held together by corneodesmosomes (intercellular adhesive structures). Their plasma membranes are replaced by cornified envelopes (CEs), insoluble and chemically resistant structures made from transglutaminase (TGM)-mediated cross-linked protein (Evora et al. 2021). With their attached lipids, CEs constitute a specialized hydrophobic barrier to the environment (Meyer et al. 2021).\nThe composition of CEs determines their biomechanical properties and influences barrier function. A\nlarge list of proteins, including filaggrin (FLG), involucrin (IVL), loricrin (LOR), and members of several protein families, such as keratin (KRT), late cornified envelope (LCE), and small proline-rich (SPRR) proteins, are known CE precursors (Karim et al. 2019b). These precursor proteins not only participate in barrier function but can also have roles in inflammatory diseases, wound healing, and mucosal defense against microbes (De Heller-Milev et al. 2000; Herman and Herman 2019; Inada et al. 2000). Disruption of these CE components can lead to the development of several skin disorders. For example, decreased expression or mutations of FLG are strong predisposing factors for atopic dermatitis (Palmer et al. 2006).A genetic basis for lamellar ichthyosis can be found in reduced TGM1 activity, which impairs the cross-linking of CE components (Huber et al. 1995; Russell et al. 1995). Moreover, the transcription of certain CE proteins changes drastically during aging, concomitant with altered skin permeability, reduced post-injury barrier recovery, and increased pathogen invasion (Rinnerthaler et al. 2013).\nEnvironmental factors that influence barrier function and skin health include ultraviolet light\nradiation, air pollution, tobacco smoke, diet, and cosmetic products. Among them, air pollution is considered the world\u2019s largest environment health threat, and combustion products in polluted air can promote oxidative stress (Parrado et al. 2019). A recent study has demonstrated that abnormal CE formation occurs in cultured keratinocytes exposed to liquid smoke (LS) (Lin et al. 2021). LS is generated from smoke condensates of smoldering wood chips, a process similar to biomass burning during wildfires. Mimicking emissions from biomass burning, LS shares many chemical components with woodsmoke, including oxidative carbonyl compounds (Montazeri et al. 2013; Simon et al. 2005). These pro-oxidants and electrophiles in LS can induce oxidative stress, leading to protein damage and\nprotein cross-links. The LS-induced CEs were also found to have higher protein content than those induced by ionophore. Unlike TGM-catalyzed protein cross-linking, that induced by oxidative damage is less specific and can occur not only between CE precursors but also among other cellular proteins. Therefore, the previous study suggests that abnormal incorporation of cellular proteins into CEs could disrupt barrier function, revealing a mechanism through which air pollution can adversely affect the skin.\nBesides air pollution, other environmental chemicals are also capable of ROS generation and can\npose risks to skin health. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene, found widely in the environment, are a good example (Tsuji et al. 2011). Additionally, the herbicide paraquat (1,1\u2019- dimethyl-4,4\u2019-bipyridinium) can cause a variety of skin diseases through redox cycling and ROS generation (Black et al. 2008). Despite the importance of CEs for skin barrier function, the impacts of environmental exposures on CE composition have hardly been studied. Here, we performed a proteomic analysis of CEs induced by exposure to three environmental pro-oxidants: (1) 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4naphthoquinone (DMNQ), a redox cycling compound that produces ROS without adduct formation (Ross et al. 1986), (2) mesquite liquid smoke (MLS), an extract of woodsmoke condensate that is rich in reactive carbonyl compounds, and (3) 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), which causes oxidative stress through persistent activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Reichard et al. 2006). CEs induced by these three chemicals were compared to X537A-induced CEs because calcium is a key regulator of keratinocyte differentiation (Bikle et al. 2012; Elsholz et al. 2014) and ionophore X537A (a known in vitro CE inducer) can permeabilize the cell membrane to extracellular calcium, activating TGMs (calcium-dependent enzymes) for protein cross-linking and CE assembly (Rice and Green 1979)."

            "text": "Chemicals. DMNQ (2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, purity \u2265 99%) and X537A (lasalocid,\npurity \u2265 98%) were purchased from Cayman Chemical, USA (items no.19571 and no. 15505). TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) was purchased from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Chemical Carcinogen Repository. MLS (Wright\u2019s Mesquite liquid smoke, USA) was purchased from local supermarkets. A recent cell-based assessment of liquid smoke has estimated that in a mouse hepatoma cell line, 24 h exposure to 0.05~0.1 \u00b5l/ml MLS is equal to exposure to 2 \u00b5M tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) and could lead to 1.5-fold Nrf2 induction (compared to vehicle control). In a human breast cancer cell line, 24 h exposure to 0.05~0.1 \u00b5l/ml MLS is equal to exposure to 0.8 pM TCDD and could lead to 15% of maximal AhR activation (Selin et al. 2022).\nCell culture. Human epidermal keratinocytes (passage 5-10) were derived from a sample of\nostensibly normal adult foreskin (Rice et al. 1993). These cells were grown with 3T3 feeder layer support in a 2:1 mixture of Dulbecco Vogt Eagle\u2019s and Ham\u2019s F-12 media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.4 \u00b5l/mg hydrocortisone, 5 \u00b5g/ml insulin, 5 \u00b5g/ml transferrin, 0.18 mM adenine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Allen-Hoffmann and Rheinwald 1984), and 10 \u00b5M Y-27632, a Rho kinase inhibitor that increases proliferative capacity and lifespan of primary human keratinocytes while preserving their capacity to differentiate (Chapman et al. 2010).\nMeasurement of cornified envelopes. At confluence, keratinocytes were treated with 100 \u00b5M\nDMNQ, 10 \u00b5l/ml MLS, 10 nM TCDD, or 100 \u00b5M X537A in medium without epidermal growth factor or Y-27632. After desired incubation times, cells were harvested in Tris-EDTA buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 20 mM dithioerythritol, and incubated in a 70\u00b0C oven for 30 min. Once soluble proteins were dissolved, CEs (insoluble in denaturants) were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 rpm. The CE samples were then rinsed twice with Tris-EDTA buffer containing 0.1% SDS and resuspended in this solution for quantitation. Light scattering at A340 was used as a measure of CE quantity as CEs are insoluble particulates that scatter light in suspension (Rice and Green 1979).\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. LDH activity in the medium was used to monitor plasma\nmembrane permeability following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, cell culture medium was collected and incubated with LDH Substrate Mix at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. After adding the Stop Solution, the reaction product, formazan (whose level is directly proportional to the amount of LDH released into the medium), was measured at 490 nm. A680 value (background) was first subtracted\nfrom the A490 value, and the % of LDH release was calculated using the following formula: [treatment or control value / maximum value] X 100%. The value of the maximum LDH release was obtained by treating the cells with lysis buffer.\nProteomic sample preparation. At confluence, cultured keratinocytes were treated with 100 \u00b5M\nDMNQ, 10 \u00b5l/ml MLS, 10 nM TCDD, or 100 \u00b5M X537A in medium without epidermal growth factor or Y-27632. TCDD requires a week to induce maximal CE formation (the others induced CE formation from nearly all the cells after one day). After 3-day (or 7-day for TCDD) incubation, cell pellets were collected, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in Tris-EDTA buffer. The samples were processed and separated into SDS-dithiothreitol soluble and insoluble (envelope) fractions as previously described (Karim et al. 2019b). Specifically, to facilitate release and removal of the solubilized proteins, pellets were extracted 4 times with 2% SDS-0.1 M sodium phosphate-50 mM dithiothreitol. Each time, the pellets were incubated in a 95 \u00b0C water bath for 5 min followed by magnetic stirring at room temperature for 30 min. After each extraction, the soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 10 min. After the 4th extraction, aliquots of the first solubilized and final insoluble fractions were alkylated with 0.1 M iodoacetamide for 45 min in the dark. The solubilized proteins were recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellets from the two fractions were then rinsed with 70% ethanol twice, resuspended in 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate-10% acetonitrile solution, and digested with reductively methylated trypsin (~ 1% by mass). Digestion was continued for 3 days with daily additions of trypsin. Finally, the samples were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 30 min, and the supernatants (containing the tryptic peptides) were submitted for mass spectrometric analysis.\nMass spectrometry and database searching. Peptide chromatographic separation was performed on\na Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a PepSep C18 column (8 cm capillary length, 150 \u00b5m inner diameter, and 1.5 \u00b5m particle size) at a flow rate of 0.5 \u00b5l/min and a multistep gradient with (A) 0.1% formic acid in water and (B) 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Eluted peptides were analyzed by an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A MS scan was obtained with the following settings: scan range 350-1500 m/z, resolution 60,000, and automatic gain control target value 300%. MS/MS spectra were acquired using the top 40 method with a resolution of 15,000, automatic gain control target value of 200%, isolation width 1.5 m/z, and normalized collision energy 30%. The generated MS/MS spectra were searched against the UniProt Human Proteome (149,646 entries), appended with common laboratory contaminants and an\nequal number of reverse decoy sequences, using X! Tandem Alanine (2017.2.1.4). The search was performed with settings as previously described (Karim et al. 2019a; Rice et al. 2017).\nIdentified peptides and proteins were validated by Scaffold (4.10.0) with <0.1% peptide decoy false\ndiscovery rate and 1.2% protein false discovery rate (two peptide minimum). Proteins with shared peptides were grouped. Spectral counts of exclusive peptides (those belonging to only one protein) were compiled and compared to weighted peptide counts (adjusted according to the number of other proteins sharing the same peptide sequence), and proteins with no or very few exclusive peptides were removed from the analysis. The Scaffold file and all raw data are available at the massive Proteomics repository (https://massive.ucsd.edu/) with MassIVE id number MSV000090901, and Proteome Exchange (http://www.proteomexchange.org/) with dataset identifier #PXD038827.\nAbundance analysis. Estimates of relative protein abundance were obtained using exponentially\nmodified protein abundance index (emPAI) calculations through the Scaffold platform. Based on empirical observations (Ishihama et al. 2005) and available as open-source software (Shinoda et al. 2010), this semi-quantitative method is commonly employed to indicate relative protein amounts and changes in their abundance. This method has previously estimated the keratin content of SDSdithiothreitol insoluble envelope material in hair shaft (Rice et al. 2009) and nail plate (Rice et al. 2010) as ~45%.\nStatistical analysis. For proteomics, proteins with less than 1 average weighted spectral count from\nall the samples were excluded. The weighted spectral count data were TMM (trimmed mean of M values) normalized (Robinson and Oshlack 2010) and analyzed using the limma-voom Bioconductor pipeline (limma version 3.46.0, edgeR version 3.32.1) (Ritchie et al. 2015). This pipeline log transforms and scales the count data, fits a linear model to each protein, and uses empirical Bayes smoothing (Smyth 2004) to improve estimates of standard errors of log fold changes for hypothesis testing, and adjusted the p-values for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate controlling method (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). The model used in limma included effects for treatment, fraction, the interaction between treatment and fraction, and experiment. Log fold changes between treatments and fractions were estimated as contrasts in this model. TCDD-CEs (7 days of exposure) were compared to X537A-CEs (3 days of exposure, giving maximal envelope formation). Analyses were conducted using R (version 4.0.5). The rmd file from the limma analysis can be found in Supplementary File 1.\nFor cell culture experiments, comparisons between more than 2 groups were performed using one-\nway ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s post hoc test to calculate individual differences. Unpaired t-testing was used to compare differences between 2 treatment groups. The analyses were performed on GraphPad Prim 9 with a significance set at p < 0.05.\nEnrichment analysis. The official gene symbols of differentially expressed proteins were uploaded\nto the DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) bioinformatics resources (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/). Enriched GO (Gene Ontology) terms associated with the protein list and the number of proteins involved in each term were generated. Modified Fisher Exact p-value (EASE score) was calculated to determine whether the uploaded protein list was specifically enriched in a particular GO term by more than random chance. When the entire family of tests was considered, the false discovery rate was corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction."

            "text": "Through membrane damage and permeabilization, exposure to DMNQ could result in influx of\nextracellular calcium, activation of TGMs, and the subsequent enzyme-mediated protein cross-linking and CE assembly, an adverse outcome pathway similar to exposure to X537A. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, chelating calcium with EDTA and alkylating the cysteine active site of TGMs with iodoacetamide (IA) drastically prevented both DMNQ and X537A from inducing CE formation. Despite membrane damage and permeabilization, calcium chelation and TGM inhibition did not prevent MLS from inducing CE formation. This is due to its carbonyl content capable of chemical-induced crosslinking, as previously described (Lin et al. 2021). However, once the generated ROS or reactive carbonyls were neutralized by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), DMNQ- and MLS-induced membrane permeabilization (Figure 2C, left panel) and CE formation (Figure 2C, right panel) were decreased . In contrast, NAC did not prevent X537A from permeabilizing cell membranes or inducing CE formation because X537A does not initiate its effect through ROS generation.\nThe level of similarity of individual proteomic samples was visualized using multidimensional scaling (MDS)\nKeratinocytes treated with DMNQ, MLS, TCDD and X537A were collected, processed, and prepared\nfor proteomic analysis. The envelope fraction (which contains insoluble envelope proteins) and the soluble fraction (which contains solubilized cytosolic proteins) from each treatment were analyzed separately. As shown by multidimensional scaling (MDS), a two-dimensional display of sample similarity, the profiles of X537A, DMNQ, and MLS soluble fractions locate closely together, indicating\nsimilar proteomes (Figure 3). In the envelope fractions, cells treated with X537A and DMNQ have similar protein compositions. Since MLS is capable of protein adduct formation, it produced CEs with a distinct protein profile from DMNQ-CEs, despite both acting through ROS production. Finally, the envelope and soluble protein profiles from cells treated with TCDD were isolated from those of other treatments, suggesting that TCDD altered cytosolic and envelope proteomes through a unique mechanism, potentially by long-term AhR activation.\nQuantitative estimation and enrichment analysis of CE protein profiles\nProtein amounts were estimated by exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI)\ncalculations (Supplementary File 2), of which the top 20 are shown in Table 1. Together, these top 20 proteins account for ~80% of the total CE protein in each group. Both DMNQ- and X537A-CEs are\ncomprised of S100 calcium-binding proteins, annexins (ANXA1 and ANXA2), small proline-rich proteins (SPRRs), and desmosomal proteins (JUP, DSP, PKP1, and PPL). In MLS-CEs, the major components are the keratins (KRTs) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a common target of ROS due to its catalytic cysteine residue (Lazarev et al. 2016). Finally, increased levels of late cornified envelope proteins (LCEs), cornifelin (CNFN), and cysteine rich c-terminal 1 (CRCT1) were found in TCDD-CEs. Interestingly, unlike the other three groups, the top 20 proteins were more evenly distributed in amount among each constituent in TCDD-CEs.\nTo further characterize proteins that were differentially enriched by the environmental ROS\ngenerators, proteins in DMNQ-, MLS-, and TCDD-CEs were compared to those in X537A-CEs, and 140, 631, and 417 proteins, respectively, were found to be at least 2-fold significantly higher (p < 0.01). These proteins were classified by their biological process (BP) using gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Sorting by adjusted p-values, the top five GO-BP terms from each treatment are shown in Figure 4. In DMNQ-CEs, only three GO-BP terms were statistically significant. The proteins enriched by MLS are involved in various biological processes, including tRNA aminoacylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, protein folding, intermediate filament organization, and fatty acid beta-oxidation. In TCDD-CEs, the enriched proteins mainly function in keratinization, protein folding, proteasome-mediated ubiquitindependent protein catabolic processes, intermediate filament organization, and glycolysis. Statistical comparisons of all 2727 proteins between the ROS generators and X537A are found in Supplementary File 3.\nProfiles of CE precursors\nA list of 166 previously identified CE precursors was compiled from GO Annotations: cornified envelope (GO:0001533, cellular component), keratinization (GO:0031424, biological process), and keratinocyte differentiation (GO:0030216, biological process). In addition, KPRP, KRT13, and KRT14 were recently discovered in human stratum corneum by proteomics and were thus added to the list (Karim et al. 2019b). When searched against this list, 92 precursors were found in our datasets, and together comprised 50%, 45%, 64%, and 69% of the X537A-, DMNQ-, MLS-, and TCDD-CEs, respectively. Table 2 lists CE precursors that comprised \u2265 0.5% of the total CE proteins. Precursors in DMNQ-CEs differed little from X537A-CEs. MLS-CEs contained substantial amounts of keratin and very few SPRRs and desmosomal proteins. Finally, TCDD-CEs had more diversified precursors, and many of them (e.g., SPRRs and LCEs) are encoded in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) (Kypriotou et al. 2012). The list of 166 CE precursors and details of the search results are found in Supplementary File 4.\nWhile ionophore-induced CE formation is a valuable model for examining envelope formation in\nkeratinocytes, present results reflect the incomplete degree of cell maturation in culture. As shown in Figure 5, keratins comprised nearly 40% of the total soluble cytosolic protein in treated cultures. This is similar to previous measurements when the culture system was first established and much lower than the 85% of total protein extractable from in human callus (Sun and Green 1978). By contrast, the keratin content in CEs induced by X537A and DMNQ was ~2% compared to ~70% observed in CEs from callus (Karim et al. 2019b). The cultured cells express only a low level of certain differentiation features, such as the non-membrane-bound TGM3 (0.1% the level of TGM1 compared to 25% in epidermis) (Supplementary Table S4C), which we speculate augments TGM1-cross-linked structures with keratins. Remarkably, CEs induced by MLS and TCDD were nearly 50% and 15% keratin, respectively, although neither treatment induces keratin expression (Hu et al. 2013; Lin et al. 2021). These findings indicate the considerable vulnerability of CE to modification of their protein profiles by such treatment.\nMitochondrial proteins were cross-linked by MLS into CEs\nMitochondrial (Mt) proteins are sensitive to oxidative damage. To further assess the impact of ROS\ngenerators on Mt proteins, we searched our datasets against GO annotation mitochondrion (GO: 0005739 cellular component) and identified 67 Mt proteins. Quantitatively, these Mt proteins account for about 1% of the total solubilized cytosolic protein among all four treatments. In the envelope fraction, these Mt proteins account for 0.14%, 0.14%, 0.67%, and 0.09% of the total protein in X537A,\nDMNQ, MLS, and TCDD group, respectively. When compared to X537A-CEs, 2, 40, and 19 of these 67 Mt proteins were increased at least 2-fold (p < 0.01) by DMNQ, MLS, and TCDD (Figure 6). These findings indicate that, compared to CEs induced by non-ROS generator X537A, DMNQ incorporated very few Mt proteins into the envelopes. In MLS-CEs, however, a considerable number of Mt proteins were targeted for incorporation, resulting in a significant increase of Mt protein level in the CEs (p < 0.0001). Finally, although the level of Mt proteins did not increase in the TCDD group (p =0.33), 19 out of 67 Mt proteins were differentially enriched, suggesting that TCDD was incorporating a different profile of Mt proteins into the CEs. Nevertheless, this result demonstrates that Mt proteins are targets of MLS-mediated protein cross-linking, which is consistent with GO-BP analysis (Figure 4) since biological processes such as tRNA aminoacylation, protein folding, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and betaoxidation occur in mitochondria. The list of Mt proteins and details of the search results can be found in Supplementary File 5."

            "text": "Since cellular proteins can be targeted by pro-oxidative chemicals and be abnormally incorporated\ninto CEs, we next examined whether proteins of AhR target genes could alter CE proteome. A list of AhR downstream genes was compiled from previous studies using cDNA microarray, RNA-sequencing, and meta-analysis on human cell cultures exposed to TCDD (Kim et al. 2009; Oshchepkova et al. 2020; Teino et al. 2020) (Supplementary File 6). As shown in Figure 7, proteins of well-known AhR target genes CYP1A1 and ALDH1A3 were enriched significantly in both TCDD envelope and soluble fractions. The lack of proteins of other AhR target genes, such as CYP1B1 or AHRR, can be attributed at least partly to the relatively small dynamic range of untargeted proteomics, where many proteins are too low in amount to be detected, compared to next generation sequencing. Nevertheless, despite small relative quantities (0.03% and 0.01% of the total soluble and envelope protein in the TCDD group), the presence of CYP1A1 protein still demonstrates the abnormal incorporation of non-CE precursors into the CEs by environmental chemicals."

            "text": "The formation of covalent cross-links within or between proteins can profoundly impact their\nconformation and biological properties, such as turnover or activity. While some of these cross-links are formed enzymatically and are essential in stabilizing or maintaining protein structure and function (e.g., TGM-mediated cross-links), others that are generated as a consequence of oxidant exposure are potentially harmful to the cell (Fuentes-Lemus et al. 2021). These undesired protein cross-links could end up as targets of proteasomal degradation. However, if the proteasomal system is overwhelmed and deactivated by oxidative stress, the unwanted cross-links could accumulate, altering the cellular proteome (Jung et al. 2014). Moreover, protein adducts of exogenous chemicals can stimulate the immune system, leading to inflammation and allergic sensitization (Natsch et al. 2012).\nThe actions through which chemicals induce CE formation could have great impact on the CE protein\nprofiles. It is likely that DMNQ induces CE formation through ROS-mediated membrane permeabilization, allowing calcium influx to activate TGMs for protein cross-linking. Since DMNQ is non-alkylating and non-adduct forming, it produced CEs with profile similar to that induced by X537A. Although MLS-induced CE formation was also associated with membrane permeabilization, MLS does not rely solely on TGMs for protein cross-linking. A carbonyl can form an adduct with a protein side chain and further reaction with another protein side chain can produce a cross-linked species (Hagglund et al. 2018). Therefore, MLS-CEs appear to result from both TGM- and chemical-induced protein crosslinking through cell membrane permeabilization and oxidative damage to cellular proteins (Lin et al. 2021).\nUnlike TGM-mediated cross-linking, oxidative cross-linking is less specific and can incorporate\nvarious proteins that are vulnerable to oxidative damage. Among them, Mt proteins were found to be one of the main targets. Because Mt proteins are rich in cysteine residues, the concentration of exposed protein thiols within the mitochondrial matrix is estimated to be 20 to 25- fold higher than that of glutathione in the same compartment (Requejo et al. 2010). These exposed protein thiols, comprising an antioxidant defense against ROS generated from the respiratory chain, could also turn the mitochondria into targets of environmental oxidant pollutants due to the rapid reaction of thiols with ROS and electrophiles.\nAhR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that responds to exogenous and endogenous stimulants\nby inducing expression of a variety of target genes (Denison et al. 2011). Beyond its role in xenobiotic metabolism, AhR is also an important regulator of skin barrier formation (Fernandez-Gallego et al.\n2021; Furue et al. 2014), and triggers the expression of genes in the epidermal differentiation complex (Sutter et al. 2011). Consistent with our proteomic profiling, many CE precursors from the complex were substantially enriched in the TCDD group. However, prolonged AhR activation can cause exaggerated acceleration of keratinocyte terminal differentiation, leading to exacerbated keratinization (Furue and Tsuji 2019). As demonstrated by our GO-BP analysis, the most significant enriched protein category in the TCDD group is keratinization.\nThe detailed mechanism through which TCDD activates TGM for CE assembly remains unclear, and\nit is unlikely through plasma membrane permeabilization. A possible mechanism could be disruption of the intracellular calcium homeostasis as reported by previous studies in other cell types (MoralesHernandez et al. 2012; Rainey et al. 2017). ROS production can also be a contributor as antioxidants, such as quercetin and NAC, were shown to abrogate the effect of TCDD to promote CE formation (Kennedy et al. 2013). Overexpression of CYP1A1 is considered to an important source of intracellular ROS, and siRNA knockdown of CYP1A1 was shown to reduce ROS production in human endothelial cells treated with TCDD (Kopf and Walker 2010). In our study, TCDD stimulated CE formation slowly, suggesting long-term alterations are required for TCDD to elicit toxicity and disrupt important cell functions, such as calcium or redox homeostasis.\nCross-linking is often seen in oxidatively damaged proteins and aggregates (Levy et al. 2019).\nTargets of such cross-linking are proteins that are available or vulnerable to oxidative attack or modification. Decades ago, the precursor availability model (also known as the dustbin hypothesis) explained molecular details regarding CE formation (Michel et al. 1987; Robinson et al. 1997). In this model, the authors speculated that proteins, regardless of their roles in other cellular processes, can potentially function as CE components depending on (a) the precursors that are available at the time of cross-linking and (b) the types of TGMs present and their interactions with the specific cross-linking sites on the target proteins. The present study indicates the importance of a cellular redox environment that supplies oxidatively damaged proteins. For example, despite DMNQ-CEs sharing similar protein profiles with X537A-CEs, one of the top 20 abundant proteins, beta-actin (ACTB), was increased to 9% by DMNQ (vs. 2.3% in X537A-CEs) (Table 1). This can be attributed to different levels of oxidative status as beta-actin can be oxidized by ROS (normally, this modification is essential for cytoskeleton organization) (Fiaschi et al. 2006). In MLS-CEs, the most enriched proteins are the keratins. This could be due to their abundance in the cells and thereby, a high chance of interaction with the reactive carbonyls and being oxidatively modified. Finally, CYP1A1 is unlikely a substrate of TGMs because it is not as abundant as SPRRs or LCEs (other proteins induced after AhR activation) in TCDD-CEs. Yet,\nthe presence of CYP1A1 protein in the envelope fraction suggests other mechanisms, such as oxidative cross-linking, could play a role.\nStudies in neurodegenerative diseases and premature senescence have revealed that certain proteins are more prone to oxidative damage and subsequent intracellular accumulation (Le Boulch et al. 2018; Martinez et al. 2010). These proteins are classified into several functional groups, including (1) glycolysis and energy metabolism, (2) cytoskeleton, (3) chaperones, and (4) members of the ubiquitinproteasome system, in line with our findings (Figure 4). The accumulation of unwanted protein crosslinks has been associated with aging and the progression of many human diseases (Levy et al. 2019; Reeg and Grune 2015). In the case of skin, as demonstrated by the current study, oxidative cross-linking can alter the CE proteome, a mechanism by which pro-oxidative environmental pollutants could exacerbate development of adverse cutaneous conditions."
