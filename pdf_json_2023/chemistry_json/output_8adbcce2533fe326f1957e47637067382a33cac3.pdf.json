    "abstractText": "The rapid identification of early hits by fragment-based approaches and subsequent hit-to-lead optimization represents a challenge for drug discovery. To address this challenge, we created a strategy called \u2018DOTS\u2019 that combines molecular dynamic simulations, computer-based library design (chemoDOTS) with encoded medicinal chemistry reactions, constrained docking, and automated compound evaluation. To validate its utility, we applied our DOTS strategy to the challenging target syntenin, a PDZ domain containing protein and oncology target. Herein, we describe the creation of a \u2018best-in-class\u2019 sub-micromolar small molecule inhibitor for the second PDZ domain of syntenin validated in cancer cell assays. Key to the success of our DOTS approach was the integration of protein conformational sampling during hit identification stage and the synthetic feasibility ranking of the designed compounds throughout the optimization process. This approach can be broadly applied to other protein targets with known 3D structures to rapidly identify and optimize compounds as chemical probes and therapeutic candidates.",

            "text": "One of the major bottlenecks in the early phases of small molecule drug discovery is the \u2018hit-to-lead' optimization of compounds identified by experimental screening 1. In recent years, we have developed an integrative strategy that combines virtual screening (VS) with automated synthesis in a platform called 'Diversity-Oriented Target-Focused Synthesis' (DOTS2, 3). This methodology was first validated by optimizing bromodomain inhibitors and enabled the design of several compounds with improved affinity by orders of magnitude. In DOTS, after the identification of a ligand and characterization of its binding mode using a structural biophysics method, such as X-ray crystallography, a virtual chemical library is generated by combining an appropriate activated chemical core analog with a collection of functionalized 'building blocks' (BB). This optimization step is based on the use of previously encoded in silico organic chemical reactions that are relevant to medicinal chemistry 4. The latter ensures that selected virtual compounds are feasibly synthesized in one or two steps and with high yields. Physicochemical filters are then automatically applied to extract a diverse subset of representative compounds that possess reasonable properties without any undesirable functions for medicinal chemists. The final chemical library is used for virtual screening with the 'S4MPLE' tool 5 to identify the best putative optimizations that create additional favorable contacts with the protein binding site while maintaining the original binding mode. The selected compounds are then synthesized using manual or robotic de novo synthesis. Finally, the synthesized compounds are evaluated using a variety of biochemical and biophysical assays on our automated screening platform in a rapid and cost-effective manner. Moreover, in a previous work, we published the 'McDSO\u2019 structure-based method which consists of identifying hits by coupling molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) with constrained docking and pharmacophore filters 6. We propose here to bring together \u2018McDSO\u2019 (for hit identification) and 'DOTS' (for hit-optimization) in an integrative and semiautomated 'fragment-based drug design (FBDD)' protocol for challenging targets. Protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs), more particularly those of PDZ domains, which are protein modules that participate in many signaling pathways, represent an attractive but particularly challenging target for drug discovery 7. PDZ domains\nrecognize the C-termini of their protein partners and are critical for regulating several biological events such as scaffolding, trafficking and signaling cascades. More precisely, the last C-terminal residue of the PDZ partner is hydrophobic and its side chain is located within a hydrophobic pocket, while the terminal carboxylic group is involved in a canonical hydrogen-bond network. Thus, disrupting this PPI, for instance, by using small organic compounds, could have a major impact on the modulation of these biological processes.\nWe previously reported the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting the second PDZ domain of syntenin (SyntPDZ2) using an FBDD strategy 8. A compound was first identified in an experimental screening of fragment-like compounds. Its binding mode was subsequently characterized using X-ray crystallography. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) and molecular modeling simulations were undertaken starting from this low-affinity fragment. However, none of the synthetized compounds resulting from these studies had the potential to be optimized as a potent lead. In this study, we report a new series of potent Synt-PDZ2 inhibitors, from their initial identification to their hit-to-lead optimization, using an integrated workflow combining DOTS and McDSO methods."

            "text": "To identify putative cryptic pockets or deeper cavities to accommodate organic ligands mimicking the binding mode of the reference protein partners, we first used molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) starting from four reference Synt-PDZ2 Xray structures. Interestingly, the induced-fit conformation around F213 from the 1W9E structure was reproduced within the trajectory of the 1N99 apo structure. This analysis finally led to the selection of 5 MDS snapshots that were further refined using a common minimization protocol. The final set of protein conformations for the subsequent ensemble docking stage consisted of the 4 original X-ray structures and 5 refined conformations from the MDS. The detailed workflow is depicted in Figure 1A. A subset of the ZINC database 9 was then used to screen this ensemble of conformations for ligand binding using molecular docking. Forty-three million poses were generated and subsequently filtered out using a pharmacophore to extract compounds able to partially mimic the binding mode of syndecan, the endogenous protein partner of Synt-PDZ2. It should be noted that all four human syndecans (Syndecan-1/2/3/4) share the same C-terminal sequence (EFYA). This is peculiar because PDZ domains usually recognize larger terminal hydrophobic residues such as valine or leucine. In contrast, the PDZ domains from syntenin interacts with the smallest hydrophobic residue (alanine) due to its shallow hydrophobic pocket located near the carboxylate binding loop. Thus, as expected, large hydrophobic groups near the carboxylate group were not\ntolerated by the shallow pocket from Syntenin PDZ domain (see discussion below about SAR-1). Therefore, some selectivity is expected in favour of Syntenin PDZ domains over alternative PDZ domains because of these specific structural constraints. However, while Synt-PDZ naturally recognizes protein partners with terminal small hydrophobic residues, previous work surprisingly reported the binding of peptides with larger C-terminal residues such as phenylalanine 10. The associated structural data (PDB code 1W9E) highlighted an interesting induced-fit of Synt-PDZ to accommodate this larger sidechain. This structure was included in the protein conformation ensemble, and compounds targeting this larger pocket were selected for experimental evaluation. These compounds are highlighted in Table S1. The ability to trigger this known induced-fit with the prioritized small organic compounds will be discussed below. Following the VS pipeline, 86 structurally diverse compounds, with molecular weights (MWs) ranging from 257 to 524 g.mol1 were selected, purchased and experimentally evaluated using an HTRF assay 11 as putative disruptors of the synteninsyndecan PPI (Table S1). The 86 molecules were separated into fragment-like (17 compounds) and drug-like (69 compounds) based on their MW, and were tested in triplicate at 400 and 100 \u00b5M, respectively. 17 compounds exhibiting more than 30% inhibition (5 fragments and 12 drug-like compounds) were re-evaluated at 200 \u00b5M (Figure S1). Then, 8 compounds (1 fragment and 7 drug-like) exhibiting more than 60% inhibition at 200 \u00b5M were reevaluated in the presence of NP-40 detergent (0.01%) to discard possible aggregators. In the end, one fragment hit that was not affected by NP-40 detergent, namely E5, was retained (Figure S1). These low affinities observed for these hits from the primary screening were expected because PDZ domains belong to protein-protein interaction interfaces, and are considered poorly druggable targets compared to enzymes. However, several small organic compounds have been reported in the literature as inhibitors of PDZ domains 7 (Figure S2) but they mainly exhibited inhibition in the 10 micromolar range, even after intensive SAR and optimization studies 7. Of particular note, all molecules that were expected to target the larger induced-fit subpocket (from PDB code 1W9E) showed no activity. One hypothesis was that the energy cost associated with the opening of the pocket was too high for these chemicals. Compound E5 exhibited an IC50 of 76 \u00b5M and a good ligand efficiency (LE, value of 0.26, Table 1) for a PDZ domain hit. Moreover, additional selectivity experiments were achieved, E5 appeared selective for syntenin, not affecting GRASP55-JAM-B complexes (Figure S3A) or Erbin-P0071 (Figure S3B) in HTRF. Interestingly, this compound was identified using pharmacophore filters from 3 different protein conformations (2 X-ray + 1 MDS snapshot). This hit was further validated and its binding mode within Synt-PDZ2 resolved using X-ray crystallography (PDB code 8AAI) matching the one predicted by the docking algorithm (RMSD = 0.5 \u00c5). This structure revealed that compound E5 mimicked the binding mode of the C-terminus of syndecan (Figure 2A). This result was expected because compound E5 can be described as a two residue peptidomimetic (\u2018NH2-Val-Ala-COOH\u2019), in which the amine moiety of valine is substituted by an indolinone ring. The latter undergoes strong face to face \u03c0-stacking with Phe213 and its carbonyl moiety formed one hydrogen bond with the backbone from the same aromatic residue (Figure 2). In addition, the nitrogen from the E5 central amide bond created a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Phe211. The central hydrophobic isopropyl group creates strong Van der Waals (VdW) contacts with hydrophobic sidechains from His208 and Ile212. Finally, the terminal methyl group is located within the shallow hydrophobic pocket from syntenin, and the carboxylic acid functional group forms the expected canonical hydrogen-bonding interaction network with the backbone atoms of Val209, Gly210 and Phe211. Based on these structural data, we then explored different modifications to improve the affinity of E5, while maintaining its canonical binding mode. The first SAR study (SAR-1, Figure 1B) of compound E5 was performed, leading to the synthesis of 14 analogs exploring different L-amino acid residue moieties (20-33, Scheme 1 & Table 1). To proceed, we directly condensed the commercial iso-indolinone carboxylic acid derivatives (1-3) with the corresponding L-aminoacid methyl ester hydrochloride (alanine, valine, leucine, iso-leucine or phenylalanine) in a mixture dichloromethane/trimethylamine at room temperature in the presence of coupling reagent EDCI 12. Methyl ester intermediates 4-18 obtained with good to excellent yields were then hydrolysed with LiOH to give derivatives 19-33 13. Fragment E5 was synthesized, corresponding to compound 19, to confirm the structure/affinity of our best commercial hit. Briefly, all modifications of terminal carboxylic acid function or nearby methyl groups were detrimental to the affinity. As with the compounds purchased after VS, the induced fit of syntenin was not reproduced using this new series (compounds 20 to 23, mimicking terminal valine, leucine, isoleucine and phenylalanine residues, respectively).\nScheme 1. Synthesis of iso-indolinone derivatives 19-33.\nActivity cliffs were obtained with subtle modifications of the original hit, highlighting an informative SAR in this first explored region of the ligand. In contrast, replacing the isopropyl group with a benzyl (Phe-like, compound 29) slightly improved the IC50 of the compound (IC50 = 67 \u00b5M), but at the expense of the LE value (LE = 0.22). This last result was expected because endogenous syndecans contain an aromatic residue at the second to last position. In parallel, a second SAR study (SAR-2, Figure 1B) around the indolinone core of E5 (or 19) was performed with a focus on small substitutions on the benzene ring (50-53, Scheme 2 & Table 1). Molecular modeling studies suggested that a single nonpolar heavy atom could be able to catch additional VdW interactions with the protein (e.g., carbon atoms from A251, S252 and A255). A cyclisation between the corresponding halogenated methyl (2-bromomethyl) benzoate derivatives 34-37 and (L)-valine methyl ester, in a mixture of DMF/DIPEA at 80\u00b0C, allowed the synthesis of halogenated indolinones intermediates 38-41 with moderate to good yields. Intermediates 38-41 were then hydrolysed with LiOH to give derivatives 42-45 13. As above, a peptide coupling with (L)-alanine methyl ester hydrochloride in the presence of EDCI yielded the methyl ester analogues 46-49, that were then hydrolysed with LiOH to give the desired halogenated indolinone analogues 50-53 with good yields. Of the four synthesized compounds, the chloro analog 51 and the bromo analog 52 exhibited the most potent IC50 in the 20 \u00b5M range. Thus, the addition of a single heavy atom increased the affinity by a factor of 7, highlighted by the impressive gain in LE (0.29 vs. 0.26 for compounds 51/52 and E5, respectively).\nScheme 2. Synthesis of carboxylic acid intermediates 46-49 and derivatives 50-53.\nThen, the X-ray structure of compound 29 was resolved in complex with Synt-PDZ2 confirming the native binding mode of the series (PDB code 8AAK, Figure 2B). Interestingly, the benzyl group participated in a face-to-face \u03c0-stacking interaction with H208 and created strong VdW contacts with I212 and V222 (Figure S4). Moreover, analysis of this X-ray structure highlighted that a growing optimization around the terminal benzyl group could lead to more potent inhibitors. There is indeed a nearby subpocket that could be filled, and crystallographic water molecules could also be either displaced or involved in water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the protein and the optimized ligands.\nAn in silico-based hit-to-lead (H2L) program, relying on DOTS 2, was then initiated. Two diverse chemical libraries of accessible compounds were first designed either to explore the chemical space around the original isopropyl moiety (E5) or to fill the previously described subpocket starting from 29 (Scheme 3).\nScheme 3. Synthetic pathway of the two diverse chemical libraries designed to either explore the chemical space around original isopropyl moiety from E5 (or 19) or to fill the previously introduced subpocket starting from 29.\nApproximately 2,400 theoretically accessible compounds were virtually screened against the Synt-PDZ2/29 X-ray structure using a constrained docking approach 2 to identify the best putative modifications. Compounds from the top 20% based on the force field-based interaction energy were extracted. Both water and water-free binding site variations of the SyntPDZ2/29 structure were considered to either catch potential water-mediated hydrogen bonds or to virtually displace crystallographic waters. This subset of the best modifications was ultimately re-evaluated using SeeSAR software. The main goal was to rule out molecules with either poorly predicted affinity (mainly unfavorable desolvation penalties from either ligand or protein side according to the HYDE 14 scoring function) or geometry warnings (poor dihedral angles and/or slight intra/inter clashes). Following the rescoring workflow of the best compounds from VS, 17 compounds were prioritized, synthesized and evaluated as potential lead-like inhibitors of the syntenin-syndecan PPI (Scheme 3). Nine compounds (82-90) were identified from this first DOTS-based VS around the isopropyl moiety (E5) and were synthetized according to Scheme 4 using the synthetic pathways previously described. A cyclisation between methyl (2-bromomethyl) benzoate 54 and nine selected commercial (L)-amino methyl ester derivatives, followed by an alkaline hydrolysis, a peptide coupling with (L)-alanine and a second alkaline hydrolysis led to the nine indolinone analogues 82-90 with good average yields (Scheme 4 & Table 1). Several minor structural modifications displayed a huge impact on potency. Thus, addition of methoxy (82), methyl (83), chlorine (87) and nitrile (88) groups on the para-position of the terminal phenyl ring exhibited lower potency than the reference analog, compound 29 (IC50 value of 67 \u00b5M). By contrast, p-bromo (84) analog was slightly better with an IC50 value of 35 \u00b5M. The phenol modification, mimicking the syndecan residue at the 2-position (EFYA), was also slightly better (89, IC50 value of 44 \u00b5M). The inclusion of a larger flexible spacer between the core and the terminal phenyl ring had negligible impact on potency (86, IC50 value of 63 \u00b5M). Finally, two bicycle variations were also explored for their predicted ability to add more contacts with close aromatic (H208) and aliphatic (V222) residues from the syntenin protein. The indole analog, used to mimic a \u2018Phe-to-Trp\u2019 mutation, displayed a slightly better potency (90, IC50 value of 33 \u00b5M). The best molecule, compound 85 that contained a naphthyl group, exhibited an IC50 value of 13 \u00b5M (LE=0.23, Table 1).\nScheme 4. Synthesis of carboxylic acid intermediates 73-81 and derivatives 82-90.\nSimilarly, eight compounds (91-98) were prioritized from the second DOTS-based VS around the benzyl moiety (29). They were synthetized according to Scheme 5 from the para-bromobenzyl analogue 75 using the medicinal chemistry-relevant Suzuki-Miyaura reaction rule and a collection of selected BBs (Scheme 5 & Table 1). To improve the coupling, we set up a general procedure starting with the 4-bromophenyl intermediate 75 (Scheme 4) to generate the selected library. We turned to substitution of the bromo group at the C4-position under standard Suzuki-Miyaura conditions in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 or Pd(dppf)Cl2 under aqueous basic conditions 15. After few reaction optimizations such as performing the reaction with phenylboronic acid and 75 using different bases (sodium or potassium carbonate) in various solvents such toluene, acetonitrile or a mixture toluene/ethanol, we were able to conclude that use of Pd(dppf)Cl2 and aqueous K2CO3 in acetonitrile at 80\u00b0C\nachieved optimum yield (reactions monitored by LC/MS analysis). Furthermore, under these conditions, we noticed that the cross-coupled product is hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acid derivative, probably due to methyl ester sensitivity to basic hydrolysis. Therefore, intermediate 75 reacted readily with the eight selected boronic acids or boronic esters in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2 and K2CO3 in acetonitrile at 80\u00b0C for 18h providing the corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives 91- 98 with good to moderate yields (Scheme 5). These compounds displayed IC50 values from 4.0 \u00b5M to 10.0 \u00b5M (LE values 0.19- 0.21, Table 1). The simplest modification (biphenyl, 97, IC50=9.9 \u00b5M), within the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling context, already displayed a better potency than the reference analog, compound 29 (IC50 value of 67 \u00b5M). Biphenyl analogs, with fluorine atom at the o-position between both aromatic rings, were prioritized when corresponding building blocks were commercially available. This was done because both rings were not coplanar according to the predicted binding modes from docking simulations. A Non-hydrogen atom at this position was introduced to optimize the torsion angle between both phenyl rings. Builtin dihedral angle analysis tool within SeeSAR also supported this move. The goal of the more elaborated modifications (compounds 91-98, except 97) was to either displace a crystallographic water molecule or create a water-mediated hydrogenbond network with this solvent entity. All these subsequent modifications successfully improved the affinity for the syntenin protein. The m-methoxy variation exhibited the similar potency gain (93, IC50=10 \u00b5M) as well as the m-cyano analog (92, IC50=8.8 \u00b5M). Three additional modifications with single extra ring were considered for experimental testing. Thus, the mhydroxymethyl analog (91) and the m-acetyl analog (95) exhibited a single digit micromolar potency, IC50=5.3 \u00b5M and IC50=4.2 \u00b5M, respectively. Similarly, the p-acetamide molecule (98) achieved an IC50 value of 7.7 \u00b5M. Finally, two additional compounds with an extra bicycle moiety were also investigated. The N-methyl-dihydro-isoindolin-1-one analog (96) displayed an IC50 value of 6.3 \u00b5M. Its chromone analog achieved the best potency from this sub-series (94, IC50=4.0 \u00b5M). Interestingly, the carbonyl moiety from compounds 94, 95 and 96 were superimposed in space according to the docking poses. This was the rationale behind the prioritization of these modifications despite their huge structural differences. It should be noted that these three carbonyl-containing compounds were also among the most potent ligands from the overall set of tested molecules so far.\nScheme 5. Synthesis of derivatives 91-98 via Suzuki coupling.\nSeveral new compounds exhibiting improved affinities have been obtained starting from compounds E5 (IC50=76 \u00b5M, LE=0.26) and 29 (IC50=67 \u00b5M, LE=0.22). The overall best compound, 94, exhibited an IC50 value of 4.0 \u00b5M, an almost 20-fold increase in potency after one optimization cycle. Similarly, the smallest compound within the most potent inhibitor subset, namely, compound 95, displayed an LE value of 0.20 and an IC50 value of 4.2 \u00b5M with the addition of a single decorated ring. The binding mode of 95 was subsequently resolved using X-ray crystallography (PDB code 8AAO, Figure 3A), and accurately matched that predicted by molecular modeling (RMSD=0.5 \u00c5). In addition, the expected water-mediated hydrogen bond network with the backbone of both His208 and Ser226 was observed. Of note, the typical 10 \u00b5M range from small organic inhibitors of PDZ domains was already reached.\nHowever, the chimera compounds between the most potent inhibitors synthetized from the in silico growing stage and those from the second SAR study were expected to be even more potent, while maintaining the overall original binding mode. Bromo analog 52, available in higher amount (IC50=20 \u00b5M) was selected for this stage. The previous synthetic pathways were combined and four brominated chimera compounds 116-118 and 122 were synthesized and evaluated (Figure S5, Schemes 6 & 7, Table 1). For this purpose, the primary amine group of the commercial methyl (2S)-2-amino-3-(4-bromophenyl)propanoate 99 was protected with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in a mixture of DCM/TEA, leading to the intermediate 100 in 97% yield. Once again, we performed few Suzuki-Miyaura reaction optimizations with phenylboronic acid and (2S)-3-(4-bromophenyl)2-{[(tert-butoxy)carbonyl]amino}propanoate 100 in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 or Pd(dppf)Cl2 using different bases (sodium or potassium carbonate) in various solvents such toluene, THF, acetonitrile or a mixture toluene/ethanol 15, 16. We were able to conclude that use of Pd(PPh3)4 and aqueous Na2CO3 in THF at 70\u00b0C achieved optimum yield (reactions monitored by LC/MS analysis). Therefore, intermediate 100 reacted readily under these conditions with the three selected boronic acids or boronic esters for 1h providing the corresponding derivatives 101-103 with moderate to good yields (Scheme 6). Deprotection of Boc-protected amines 101-103 was rapidly accomplished using TFA in DCM (4\u00b0C to rt) for 4h leading to L-aminoacid methyl ester derivatives 104-106. As previously, a cyclisation between the methyl 4-bromo-2-(bromomethyl) benzoate 36 and derivatives 104-106, in a mixture DMF/DIPEA at 80\u00b0C, allowed the synthesis of halogenated indolinones intermediates 107- 109 with moderate to good yields. Intermediates 107-109 were hydrolysed with LiOH to give the halogenated indolinone analogues 110-112 with good yields. At the end, a peptide coupling with (L)-Alanine methyl ester hydrochloride in the presence of EDCI yielded the methyl ester analogues 113-115, that were then hydrolysed with LiOH to give the desired halogenated indolinone analogues 116-118 with good yields (Scheme 6).\nScheme 6. Synthesis of \u201cchimera\u201d derivatives 116-118.\nSimilar synthesises were achieved starting with intermediate 100 and the L-aminoacid methyl ester derivative related to the most potent chromone derivative 94. The Suzuki coupling, followed by the acidic deprotection step and the cyclisation with methyl 4-bromo-2-(bromomethyl) benzoate 36 worked properly. However, the alkaline hydrolysis did not lead to the desired indolinone analogue. Instead, we isolated the \u2018opened\u2019 chromone form. Despite various attempts under milder alkaline hydrolysis, we could not readily synthetize the desired chromone chimera compound. The last chimera compound was obtained starting with the cyclisation between the methyl 4-bromo-2-(bromomethyl) benzoate 36 and the methyl (2S)-2-amino-3(naphtalen-2-yl)propanoate in a mixture of DMF/DIPEA at 80\u00b0C for 5h (Scheme 7). This cyclisation step allowed the synthesis of the brominated indolinone intermediate 119 in 37% yield and was followed by a hydrolysis with LiOH to give the brominated indolinone 120 in 76% yield. A peptide coupling with (L)-Alanine methyl ester hydrochloride in the presence of EDCI yielded the methyl ester analogue 121, that were then hydrolysed with LiOH to give the desired halogenated indolinone analogue 122 with an excellent yield (Scheme 7).\nScheme 7. Synthesis of \u201cchimera\u201d derivative 122.\nCompound 118 was the most potent inhibitor out of the 4 tested chimera compounds (116-118 and 122). More precisely, the final lead (compound 118, SYNTi) exhibited an IC50 value of 400 nM and LE value of 0.24 (Table 1). Despite the undruggable status of Synt-PDZ2, the LE value was almost maintained between the original hit and the final lead (0.26 vs. 0.24 for compounds E5 and SYNTi, respectively), while the affinity was increased by almost 200-fold. Noteworthy, compound SYNTi had no effect on other PDZ complexes such as GRASP55-JAM-B and Erbin-P0071 complexes in HTRF (Figure S3).\nThe structure of the Synt-PDZ2/SYNTi complex was resolved using X-ray crystallography (PDB code 8AAP, Figure 3B and Figure S4), confirming the shared binding mode within the full series (E5, 29 and SYNTi). In addition, the observed binding mode was again consistent with the binding mode predicted by molecular modeling (RMSD=0.7 \u212b).\nAn orthogonal biophysical validation was also included after the HTRF campaign to measure SYNTi direct interaction to syntenin using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). The experiment confirmed a 1:1 syntenin:SYNTi binding stoichiometry (one site) in agreement with the proposed model (Figure 4). The measured energetic forces confirmed that the optimization campaign did not result in an unfavourable entropy-enthalpy compensation and an entropy driven compound. Indeed, SYNTi displays a balanced thermodynamic binding profile with contributions from both favourable enthalpic and entropic components as shown in Figure 4 associated histogram. The enthalpic component confirms the expected net hydrogen bonds formation as shown in the X-ray structures (Figure 3), while the favourable entropic component validates potential release of structured water molecules and increased level of freedom. Analysis of three independent experiments (Supp Table S2 and Figure S6) allowed to calculate an average KD value of 1.8 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5M, although slightly lower than the measured HTRF IC50 under these experimental conditions.\nEntry Structure\nIC50\n(\u00b5M)\nLE\nEntry Structure\nIC50\n(\u00b5M)\nLE\nEntry Structure\nIC50\n(\u00b5M)\nLE\nE5\n(19)\n76 \u00b1 7.98\n0.26\n20\n> 500\nND\n21\n> 500\nND\n22\n> 500\nND\n23\n> 500\nND\n24\n213 \u00b1 15.19\n0.22\n25\n> 500\nND\n26\n> 500\nND\n27\n> 500\nND\n28\n> 500\nND\n29\n67 \u00b1 1.92\n0.22\n30\n> 500\nND\n31\n> 500\nND\n32\n> 500\nND\n33\n> 500\nND\n50\n> 200\nND\n51\n14 \u00b1 1.22\n0.29\n52\n20 \u00b1 6.19\n0.29\n53\n> 200\nND\n82\n128 \u00b1 21.27\n0.19\n83\n> 200\nND\n84\n35 \u00b1 3.13\n0.23\n85\n13 \u00b1 2.28\n0.23\n86\n63 \u00b1 9.07\n0.21\n87\n78 \u00b1 7.33\n0.21\n88\n180 \u00b1\n5.19\n0.18\n89\n44 \u00b1 2.33\n0.22\n90\n33 \u00b1 1.01\n0.21\n91\n5.3 \u00b1 0.84\n0.20\n92\n8.8 \u00b10.06\n0.20\n93\n10 \u00b1 0.07\n0.20\n94\n4.0 \u00b1 0.31\n0.21\n95\n96\n6.3 \u00b1 0.57\n0.19\n97\n9.9 \u00b1 0.91\n0.21\n98\n116\n1.5 \u00b1 0.05\n0.22\n117\n0.82 \u00b1\n0.08\n0.23\nSYNTi\n(118)\n122\n5.2 \u00b1 0.2\n0.23\nFinally, both the original hit E5 and final lead SYNTi were tested using cellular assays. In wild\u2010type MDA-MB-231 breast\ncarcinoma cells and in MDA-MB-231 cells with syntenin\u2010KO (Synt KO; CRISPR/Cas9\u2010engineered), compounds E5 and\nSYNTi were not toxic at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M (Figure S7). This concentration of compounds E5 and SYNTi significantly affected the migration speed and Euclidean distance of the wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells to the same extent as the knock-out of syntenin (Figure S8). Moreover, no such effect was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells with syntenin knockout (MDA-MB-231 Synt KO), confirming the biological specificity of the effects of E5 and SYNTi on syntenin. We next compared the efficiency of compounds E5 and SYNTi by performing dose\u2013response assays on wild-type MDA-MB-231 single cell migration (Figure 5). Compound 30 was used as an inactive control compound. First, we noticed that only the highest concentration (100 \u00b5M) of compound E5 markedly reduced the migration speed and the Euclidean distance. A treatment with 100\u00b5M of compound 30 significantly affected the Euclidean distance and the migration speed of wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure"

            "text": "Here, we report an integrated strategy combining molecular dynamics simulations and virtual screening for hit-identification, and focused virtual library design using medicinal-chemistry rules followed by constrained structure-based VS for hit optimization. Due to the inclusion of chemistry knowledge during the virtual design stage, the selected compounds can be easily synthesized in one or two steps for a quick evaluation of suggested modifications, after purchasing the relevant building blocks. Then, more complex chemistry can be considered on the most promising compounds, as highlighted by the chimera derivatives synthesis. Besides, reassessing the FF-based top compounds from VS using an independent method can improve the prioritization process. As a conclusion, the approach was successfully applied to the development of potent small organic inhibitors that can disrupt the PPI interface between the second PDZ domain of syntenin and its partner syndecan. To our knowledge, the most potent small organic compounds from this series are the best syntenin PDZ domain inhibitors described thus far in the literature,\nhighlighting the success of this integrated academic approach combining chemoinformatics, molecular modeling, organic synthesis, structural biology and biological experimental assays. Finally, this whole strategy can be easily applied to any protein with a known 3D structure."

The resulting mixture was stirred 2 h at room temperature. After completion, THF was removed in vacuo.

It combines three robust computational approaches: Molecular Dynamic simulations (MDS), molecular docking and pharmacophore-based filtering. The workflow is depicted in Figure 1A. Briefly, molecular dynamics simulations in explicit aqueous solvent, starting from X-ray structures, were performed with the Charmm force-field to create a set of additional protein conformations for the subsequent ensemble molecular docking. Then, dozen millions output poses from molecular docking were filtered out using the pharmacophore concept to extract compounds able to mimic the binding mode of endogenous peptide binders."

            "text": "MD simulations were performed starting from 4 PDB structures of the second PDZ-domain of syntenin: the apo form (1N99) and 3 structures with bound peptides (1V1T, 1W9E, 4Z33). Of note, bound peptide from 1W9E structure includes a large hydrophobic terminal residue that triggers slight conformational changes in the structure (endogenous syndecan ligands have an alanine residue as C-terminal moiety). Finally, two histidine tautomers (HSD and HSE) were considered for H208, leading to 8 independent MD simulations. The CHARMM-GUI web services (http://www.charmm-gui.org) were used to generate inputs and scripts to run the MD simulations from the reference PDB structures. CHARMM version 33 was used to perform the MD simulations. Briefly, the system was solvated with a pre-equilibrated solvation box of TIP3P water molecules around the protein. Chloride and potassium ions were then added to neutralize the system. Finally, periodic boundary conditions were automatically applied based on the system shape and size. For each considered system, unfavorable contacts were first removed by a short energy minimization protocol (max 5000 minimization cycles), followed by equilibration and production simulations. Equilibration stage consisted of two small 0.5ns simulations (time step 1 fs) with then without constraints on the protein. Production stage consisted of 50 ns simulation (time step 2 fs) without any constraints. Snapshots of the coordinates were saved every 250 steps (0.5 ps) leading to 100000 instantaneous conformations for each MD trajectory. Trajectories were analyzed using the VMD tool using both built-in and in house Tcl scripts to verify their consistency (e.g.; convergence over time using RMSD criteria over all Calpha atoms after superimposition on all frames in the same 3D referential). Then, 1 frame was extracted every 10 frames for the subsequent pocket detection analysis using the MDpocket tool 17. Molecular docking The PDB files from the ensemble set were prepared using Sybyl-X. The binding site was defined as all residues with at least one atom within 10 \u00c5 radius from the reference bound peptide from 1V1T structure. Surflex (https://www.jainlab.org/) was\nused as the docking engine and default values were used to generate the intermediate \u201cprotomol\u201d (abstract definition of binding site features that was used by Surflex during the docking process). Redocking simulations of reference peptides (2 to 5 Cterminal residues) were beforehand performed to validate the docking protocol. This control study was used to determine the best docking parameters for the target. These reference ligands were successfully redocked into the PDZ domain of syntenin with good RMSD values: lower than 1 \u00c5 between crystallized conformation and predicted pose for short peptides; and less than 2 \u00c5 for long peptide versions). Importantly, key interactions between C-terminal carboxylate and carboxylate binding loop were accurately reproduced, in addition to known hydrogen bond interactions between both backbone chains. A collection of 479K molecules was created from the Clean ZINC database (https://zinc.docking.org/). First, 371K compounds were extracted from the Clean ZINC database after clustering-based search to promote structure diversity. Then, an additional subset of 108K compounds was added to enrich the original set with carboxylate-containing compounds. It was expected that carboxylate-containing compounds would mimic the C-terminal end of reference bound peptides. Finally, the set of 479K compounds was virtually screened over the ensemble of 9 conformations using Surflex 18. A maximum of 10 poses were generated by the docking algorithm for each compound, leading to 43M output poses. Pharmacophore-based filtering The goal of this stage was to identify organic compounds able to mimic more or less strictly the binding mode of reference bound peptides. The Unity package from Sybyl-X was used as the pharmacophore screening engine. It should be noted that the full strict pharmacophore filter, with all possible features mimicking the reference peptide, retrieved no compound. In practice, only reference peptides were fished out. Two pharmacophore filters were designed starting from reference X-ray structures. The first pharmacophore filter was short but strict and required the 3 canonical hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate binding loop (V209, G210, F211) and 2 additional hydrogen bonds with F211 and F213 backbone from syntenin. The second pharmacophore was a modified version of the full strict pharmacophore in which some features were now optional. For example, only 3 out of the 5 hydrogen bonds from canonical binding mode were required. One hydrophobic feature mimicking the hydrophobic moiety from C-terminal residue was also mandatory. Finally, one last hydrophobic feature was required in the vicinity of H208 or I212 or F213. After the pharmacophore filter stage, 4k poses were extracted out of the 43M docking poses. This set was then refined by only considering docking poses with a score threshold better than \u201c6\u201d: It should be noted that some compounds were retrieved several times, as different poses of the same ligand matched the pharmacophore or they were successfully docked in different conformations from the docking ensemble. About 1k poses were finally considered and visually inspected leading to the final subset of 249 poses, of which 102 poses (41%) were identified from the 4 original X-ray conformations and 147 poses (59%) came from the MD-based conformations. These poses corresponded to 182 unique compounds. Final selection of compounds to be tested While compounds from ZINC database were perfectly defined from stereo-chemistry point of view, the commercially available compounds can be racemic mixtures. Therefore, compounds with more than one undefined stereocenter were discarded. In addition, several compounds were either very expensive or not available at the time of purchase. In the end, 86 compounds were purchased and evaluated experimentally using an HTRF assay as putative inhibitors of the syntenin-syndecan PPI interaction.\nMolecular Modeling for hit-to-lead stage H2L program relied on our previously reported DOTS strategy 2. Briefly, it requires the structure of the protein-hit complex (SBDD context) and consists in two main stages: library design followed by constrained docking. The role of the design stage is to generate accessible compounds that can be described as putative optimizations of the original compound. Then, the role of the docking stage is to prioritize the most promising compounds in order to catch additional interactions between the protein and the ligand. Design of the focused libraries The creation of the virtual focused libraries relied on the procedure described in the DOTS methodology 2. Briefly, a focused library was generated starting from an activated substructure, a collection of commercially available BBs and a set of in silico encoded chemistry reactions. This chemistry-driven strategy is expected to design accessible compounds with high reaction yields. Two diverse chemical libraries of accessible compounds were designed in this H2L context. The first focused library was created by virtually encoding the Scheme 3. Commercially available residue-like BBs with protected carboxylate (ester function) were used to generate theoretically accessible compounds with varied sidechains. 1070 compounds were initially created, out of which 766 were kept after the filtering stage. The goal of the library was to explore the chemical space around compound E5 (or 19) by replacing its isopropyl group by other substituents.\nSimilarly, a second focused library was generated using the DOTS workflow to explore the chemical space from the paraposition of compound 29 (para-Br analog, compound 84) using a Suzuki reaction and compatible commercially available BBs. 3963 compounds were initially created, out of which 1,610 have been retained after the filtering stage. The goal of the library was to explore the chemical space around compound 29 by adding an additional ring with various decorations to fill up the nearby cavity and to catch additional interactions between the protein and the ligand. The filtering stage consisted in several fully automated post-processing steps to extract a subset of duplicate-free compounds with a focus on structures with reasonable physiochemical properties. More precisely, a structural check was performed with StructureChecker from ChemAxon (http://www.chemaxon.com) to eliminate compounds with any structural warning. Duplicates and compounds that contain at least one undesired element (other than C, H, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br or I) were also discarded. Usual threshold values for common physico-chemical descriptors (molecular weight \u2264 550, cLogP \u2264 5.5, tPSA \u2264 150 \u00c5\u00b2, H-Bond acceptors \u2264 10, H-Bond donors \u2264 5, rotational bond count \u2264 14, and formal charge count \u2264 2) were used to automatically extract a subset of compounds with reasonable properties. The remaining compounds were subjected to a postprocessing: major microspecies, partial charges, force-field atomic types, and single 3D-conformer were computed for each compound. A maximum common substructure (MCS) algorithm was also used to flag atoms that were already present in the compound 19. These atoms will be constrained in the subsequent virtual screening stage (see below). The mapping of forcefield atomic types was done using programs from AmberTools (http://ambermd.org), while all the other steps were performed using in house tools relying on the ChemAxon Java API. Constrained docking of the focused libraries The virtual library of 2,376 compounds was screened into the Synt-PDZ2/29 X-ray structure, using a constrained docking approach 2, in order to select the best putative optimized compounds. The top 200 compounds were extracted on the basis of the force field-based interaction energy. Both water and water-free binding site variations of Synt-PDZ2/29 structure were considered to either catch potential water-mediated hydrogen bonds or to virtually displace crystallographic waters. The shared core from the original compound was constrained during the simulation to maintain the reference binding mode and to mimic the growing strategy from fragment-based drug discovery. The sampling stage mainly consisted in three independent simulations of 400 generations with a population of 30 individuals. All saved poses were merged into one file before switching to the post-processing stage that involved the minimization of all non-redundant poses while unlocking all ligand atoms. The energy used to rank all screened compounds was equal to the best energy of the complex minus the energy of the best conformer of the free ligand. The latter was obtained by performing three independent simulations with the same parameters on the ligand alone. The goal was to compute a potential energy difference between bound and free forms to estimate the interaction energy while considering the strain energy of the ligand. SeeSAR-based ranking of top compounds from VS This subset of the best molecules was ultimately refined using SeeSAR software (http://biosolveit.de). Briefly, this computeraided design tool relies on the HYDE method 14 to evaluate affinity contributions to the binding for each ligand atom. SeeSAR was used in this context to reassess docking poses from VS. The main goal was to discard molecules with either poorly predicted affinity (mainly unfavourable desolvation penalties from either ligand or protein side) or geometry warnings (poor dihedral angles and/or slight intra/inter clashes)."

The phase was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the PDB entry 1N99 as a template and the program PHASER. Models were rebuilt using COOT and refined with autoBUSTER. Compounds restraints were generated with grade 22 and Mogul 23 using RM1 semi-empirical QM methods."

Cells were grown in DMEM-F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Eurobio) at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. syntenin CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (SyntKO) MDA-MB-231 cells were generated following the procedures as previously described (Imjeti et al., 2017). Briefly, SDCBP-specific gRNA oligos sgRNASDCBP1 targeting exon1 (F: CACCgCTATCCCTCACGATGGAAGT; R: AAACACTTCCATCGTGAGGGATAGc) were cloned into the pX458 two-in-one CRISPR targeting vector (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA), individually transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells and sorted for GFP expression after 48 h. Single cell clones were grown and screened by western blotting for syntenin expression. One individual clone has been used in the in vitro experiments."

Briefly, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the compounds for 48 h and early/late apoptosis was measured by using the FITC Annexin V apoptosis detection kit with 7-AAD (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer. Annexin V positive but 7-AAD negative (early apoptotic cells) and Annexin V positive and 7-AAD positive (late-stage apoptosis) was determined by using FACS LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed with Flowjo software (Tree Star). Single cell migration assay 25,000 cells were seed on collagen precoated 6-wells plate. Cells were monitored using live cell imaging using Metamorph 7.8.1 and followed for 24 hours. Cell tracking was performed manually for all selected cells in 1\u20442 of the field-of-view at two different X-Y positions for at least 2 independent experiments by serial selection of the center of the cell nucleus at each time point during the time series using the Plugin \u201cManual Tracking\u201d provided in the ImageJ software. The values for the assessment of migration speed, velocity and directionality were obtained using ImageJ software. Migration speed was determined by the ratio between the total distance and duration of cell migration. Euclidean distance corresponds to the distance between the positions of the cells at the beginning and the end of the experiment 24."
