INTRODUCTION\nNonlocality in quantum physics is a concept that has long intrigued researchers. Recognizing that this concept can mean different things in different contexts, Griffiths [1] has drawn a distinction between the use of the term nonlocality to describe the properties of quantum systems, on the one hand, and nonlocal influences between systems, on the other. The latter is a subject that continues to be widely debated, even to the present day.1 Nonlocal properties of quantum systems are less controversial, but there are at times differing conceptions of what they entail. One such example, wherein a set of quantum states can exhibit nonlocal properties even when no one of those states is itself nonlocal, has received a great deal of attention in recent years. This property, first discovered over twenty years ago in the seminal work of [2], is commonly referred to as nonlocality without entanglement (NLWE) and arises in the context of quantum state discrimination [3\u20137], wherein a party or parties are tasked with determining in which one of a known set of states their shared system had been prepared. Quantum state discrimination is a key paradigm in quantum information processing and quantum computing [8], and can also play a role in any experiment for which there exists enough a priori information to narrow down the possible outcomes of that experiment. When the set of states consists only of product states, having no entanglement [9] and therefore exhibiting no nonlocal properties individually, it may still turn out that taken as a set, the collection does indeed behave nonlocally. As shown in Ref. [2], a particular set of mutually orthogonal product states on a 3 \u00d7 3 system cannot be perfectly discriminated when the parties are restricted to multiple rounds of measuring their local part of the system and communicating their outcomes to the other parties\u2014a process known as LOCC, for local operations and classical communication\u2014even though this can be easily accomplished by a single global measurement on the entire system taken as a whole. It is in this sense that the set of states exhibits nonlocality: when the system is measured locally it behaves differently than when it is measured globally. The proof of NLWE given in Ref. [2] involved a long, complicated argument. The reason was that their aim was not simply to exclude the possibility of perfect local discrimination of the states, which is actually quite easily shown, but importantly, that the parties could not even approach accomplishing this task arbitrarily\n\u2217 cohensm52@gmail.com 1 While we have not studied this issue in depth, we do lean in the direction of Professor Griffiths\u2019 view that there is no evidence\nfor these nonlocal influences.\n2 closely. We believe the latter definition of NLWE is the proper one to follow, and we will do so throughout this paper: A set of mutually orthogonal product states exhibits NLWE if and only if perfect discrimination of that set is impossible even when an error is allowed but must vanish in the limit of an infinite number of rounds. By not allowing for this vanishing error, one overlooks the fact that any measurement will be subject to experimental imperfections, that nothing is ever accomplished perfectly in the real world. As a consequence of these unavoidable imperfections, it is more appropriate to ask whether or not a task can be accomplished arbitrarily closely, and if not, the amount of error that is impossible to avoid. Many of us over the years have failed to clearly understand the important distinction that considering infinite-round protocols, alone, is not the same as allowing for vanishing error. In the former approach, it would be sufficient to show that no party can make a first local measurement without destroying orthogonality of the set (see, for example, Appendix B of [10]): if no one can start the protocol, they cannot continue it indefinitely (or, at all). This approach fails to consider all possible sequences of LOCC protocols of steadily increasing number of rounds, wherein as one proceeds through the sequence, the error incurred might become smaller and smaller, approaching zero asymptotically. To better understand what is missed, let us consider how one may think about these things. LOCC protocols are commonly viewed as a tree graph with a single root node representing the situation before any party has measured. From the root node, the tree branches to multiple nodes, each one representing an outcome of the first measurement, which is local, being implemented by only one party. From each of these nodes, the tree continues to branch to more nodes, each set of child nodes of a given parent node representing outcomes of the local measurement performed at that stage of the protocol. A finite branch of the tree starts at the root and continues until it reaches a node that has no children, denoted as a leaf node. In the limit of an infinite number of rounds, there may be branches that never terminate and are of infinite length. As shown in [11], each branch (finite or infinite) corresponds directly to a continuous path of product operators through a particular subset of operator space. Significantly, for a given protocol, each such path is piecewise local, which means that it consists of straight line segments along which the product operator changes only in one party\u2019s local part. For example on a bipartite system, this might be represented as [(1\u2212 x)A + xA\u2032] \u2297 B, which is a line stretching from A \u2297 B to A\u2032 \u2297 B as x ranges from 0 to 1, A\u2032 corresponding to one outcome of a local measurement by Alice, A being the cumulative effect of Alice\u2019s actions up to (and preceding) this latest measurement. Only the A-part changes, the B-part remains unchanged. This piecewise local property applies even to infinite branches, which then consist of many (an infinite number of) infinitesimally short pieces. To understand why only considering individual infinite-round protocols overlooks possibilities, let us recall how we learned about integrals in our introductory calculus classes: any curve can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a piecewise constant curve, and this provides a way to approximate the area under the original curve. In the limit that the number of constant pieces goes to infinity, the piecewise constant curve asymptotically approaches the original curve, which in general is not piecewise constant. Similarly, there exist sequences of LOCC protocols for which each protocol in the sequence corresponds to piecewise local paths in operator space, but for which the limit of this sequence corresponds to paths which are not piecewise local. In particular, it may well be that the limit of a sequence of LOCC protocols corresponds to an initial measurement that is not local, and such sequences are not excluded by simply demonstrating that the only initial local measurement that does not destroy orthogonality of the original set is a measurement for which all outcomes are proportional to the identity operator (a trivial measurement). Instead, as we will see below, it is sufficient to show that any non-trivial initial separable measurement operator that is arbitrarily close to IH destroys orthogonality, see Corollary 1. In an effort to ensure these ideas are clear, let us divide the class of infinite-round protocols into two distinct subclasses [12]. The first subclass involves sequences of protocols where each subsequent protocol in a given sequence differs from the preceding protocol simply by adding more rounds of communication, but without changing the local measurements implemented in earlier rounds. Since the earlier rounds are unchanged, the branches remain piecewise local even in the infinite limit. Thus, one obtains a valid LOCC protocol in this limit, albeit one having an infinite number of rounds, so this subclass may be seen as being a part of LOCC. The second subclass includes limits of sequences in which measurements made at the earlier rounds are changed from one protocol in the sequence to the next. This subclass must be included to obtain the asymptotic LOCC discussed above, and its inclusion gives rise to the topological closure of LOCC, which we denote as LOCC in the sequel. By changing those earlier rounds, the branches need not correspond to piecewise local paths in the infinite limit (see the comparison to limits of piecewise constant curves in the preceding paragraph) and as such, in this limit, one may fail to obtain a valid LOCC protocol. Let us review the main result, Theorem 1, of Ref. [11], where we consider a measurement as a positive\n3 operator valued measure (POVM) consisting of a set of positive semidefinite operators, Ej , known as POVM elements. Note that M \u2208 LOCC means there exists a sequence of LOCC protocols, the nth such protocol implementing measurement Mn, such that limn\u2192\u221e Mn = M. Theorem 1 of [11]. If M \u2208 LOCC, with measurement M consisting of POVM elements Ej , then for each j, there exists a continuous, monotonic path of product operators from IH to a point on the (half-open) line segment (0, Ej ], and this path lies entirely within the geometric object, ZM = \u2211 j[0, Ej ], which is known as a zonotope.\nAn alternative, but equivalent, definition of the zonotope just introduced is ZM := { z \u2223\u2223\u2223z = \u2211 j cjEj , 0 \u2264 cj \u2264 1 \u2200j } . In addition, by monotonic, we mean that the trace of the product operators is non-increasing along these paths. These paths, which need not themselves be piecewise local, are found as the limit of a sequence of piecewise local paths, the latter being associated with that sequence of LOCC protocols, the limit of which implements M. Of course, without the restriction that the paths lie within ZM, these paths would always exist. That is, there are always such paths between any pair of product operators. For example, one path from A\u2297B to A\u2032\u2297B\u2032 would be [(1\u2212x)A+xA\u2032]\u2297B followed by A\u2032\u2297 [(1\u2212y)B+yB\u2032]. As is amply illustrated by the examples in Ref. [11], however, there are many measurements for which there are no paths of product operators starting at IH and lying within ZM. It is worth noting that those examples were drawn from well-studied cases of local state discrimination, for which much of the work in [11] involved determining the most general separable measurement M capable of perfectly discriminating the given set, and then showing that the requisite paths of product operators within ZM do not exist. Here, we simplify things by finding ways to reach these conclusions for given sets of states without the need to know anything about what measurements can accomplish the task successfully. Another observation is that since the paths considered here are continuous and starting at IH, they require the existence of a positive semidefinite product operator lying within ZM at every distance, R, from IH in the range 0 \u2264 R \u2264 d(IH, Ej), with d(X,Y ) the distance between (normalized operators) X and Y . Suppose such continuous paths do not exist. Then it seems a reasonable guess that the error incurred by any LOCC protocol used for implementing the desired POVM will be in some way related to how far away from ZM one must stray in order to find such paths, and in an attempt to lower bound this error, one may then consider, for each R, how far it is from ZM to the nearest positive semidefinite product operator. This is part of the motivation for the present work, in which we prove a result that is similar, but not quite identical, to what we have just conjectured. Our result differs from the ideas just described in one very important aspect: in order to know the distance of an operator from ZM, one needs to know the measurement, M. It turns out that knowledge of what measurement(s) might be successful is not needed, all we need to know is the set of states one is setting out to discriminate. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we use the insights of [11] to derive a lower bound on the probability of error, perr, in locally discriminating any mutually orthogonal set of pure states. We allow for limits of sequences of protocols, discussed above, going beyond LOCC itself to include LOCC. These arguments demonstrate that perr > 0 implies the set of states cannot be perfectly discriminated within LOCC, which would require asymptotically vanishing error. Unfortunately, we have found this lower bound to be difficult to compute. Nonetheless, in Section III, we use the insights gleaned from this lower bound to prove two theorems providing necessary conditions that a given set of states can be perfectly discriminated within LOCC, and then in Section IV, we give examples where these theorems easily demonstrate that this is impossible. We also show that perfect discrimination within LOCC is impossible when the set of states is an unextendible product basis with the minimal number of states for the associated multipartite Hilbert space, and when in addition, the local dimensions are such that the number of states satisfies N \u2265 2(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) + 1. Finally, we end with our conclusions."

            "text": "In this section, we begin by considering the error incurred in using LOCC to discriminate a set S of N orthogonal pure states on Hilbert space H: S = {\u03b7m, |\u03a8m\u3009}, given with a priori probabilities \u03b7m > 0,\u2211\nm \u03b7m = 1, and \u3008\u03a8m|\u03a8n\u3009 = \u03b4mn. For an arbitrary set of orthogonal states |\u03a8m\u3009, not necessarily a complete basis of the Hilbert space, there will generally be a number of possible global measurements that perfectly discriminate those states. In general, however, when these states describe a multipartite system, there may be constraints on the actions the parties are able to perform, and under such circumstances, any given global measurement, Mg, may be impossible. Instead, the parties may be restricted to using LOCC in their efforts\n4 to discriminate the state, and they may be forced to utilize a different measurement, say\nMQ = { Qi \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2211\ni\nQi = IH, Qi \u2265 0 } . (1)\nIt may be that MQ can be implemented by LOCC, at least arbitrarily closely: MQ \u2208 LOCC. If not, then the question arises, how well can the parties do in discriminating the state if they are able to perform the best possible LOCC measurement, MQ? Define PR to be the set of positive semidefinite product operators acting on H and lying at a distance R from the identity operator IH (distances between normalized operators are measured using the Frobenius norm, defined above Eq.

With Z\u03a8 := {z |z = \u2211\nm cm\u03a8m, 0 \u2264 cm \u2264 1 \u2200m}, it is straightforward to see that the minimum over z \u2208 Z\u03a8 is achieved at z = \u2211 m \u03b7m\u3008\u03a8m|Q|\u03a8m\u3009\u03a8m. Note that the definition of Z\u03a8 closely adheres to how ZM was defined above for a measurement M, even though the set of operators, \u03a8m, does not in general constitute a complete measurement. When perr = 0 and the set of states can be perfectly discriminated using LOCC, then operator \u03a0 effectively takes the paths of Ref. [11], which are associated with an actual complete measurement M and lie within ZM, projecting (and scaling, by the \u03b7m) them into Z\u03a8. Thus, we obtain continuous paths of product operators that lie entirely within Z\u03a8, and this is why we need not know ZM or the optimal measurement, M, that is to be used. Given this observation, it would seem to make sense to consider measurements M such that Z\u03a8 \u2286 ZM whenever possible, although it isn\u2019t entirely clear this would necessarily minimize the error. Calculating this lower bound on perr appears to be extremely challenging in practice. Approaching this problem analytically is prohibitively difficult except for the smallest systems; that is, for two qubits, in which case it is merely very challenging. For the latter case, we have been able to show for discriminating the four Bell states [8] by LOCC\u2014when they are given with equal a priori probabilities, \u03b7m = 1/4\u2014that our lower bound is perr = 1/4, which is just a factor of two smaller than the known optimal strategy [13]. That this is the correct order of magnitude may be seen as an encouraging sign. Calculating this lower bound does not appear to fall into any of the classes that admit an efficient numerical approach, however. Therefore, one would need access to significant computational resources to obtain a result with a high degree of confidence it is truly a lower bound. Therefore in the next section, we will obtain powerful necessary conditions for the possibility of perfect state discrimination by LOCC of any given set of mutually orthogonal pure states. Note that the a priori probabilities, \u03b7m > 0, are only relevant to the question of the amount of error incurred and not to whether or not perfect discrimination is possible."

            "text": "Our first necessary condition is obtained as follows. If there exists R such that \u2206R > 0, then perr > 0\u2014or alternatively (recalling the perspective of the result of Ref. [11]), the required continuous paths of product operators whose projection by \u03a0 lies entirely within Z\u03a8 do not exist\u2014then perfect discrimination of the set of states by LOCC is impossible. That is,\nTheorem 2. Given a set of mutually orthogonal quantum states, {|\u03a8m\u3009}, if for any fixed state |\u03a8n\u3009, no continuous path of positive semidefinite product operators, say Qi(s), exists such that the following two conditions hold:\n5 1. the path begins at IH and ends at some fixed positive semidefinite product operator, Qi, where \u03a0Qi\u03a0 \u221d \u03a8n, and index i will generally depend on index n;\n2. for every s, Qi(s) is diagonal in the (partial) basis of the |\u03a8m\u3009;\nthen this set of states cannot be perfectly discriminated within LOCC. Note that the condition that Qi(s) is diagonal in the |\u03a8m\u3009 is equivalent to \u03a0Qi(s)\u03a0 lying within Z\u03a8.\nProof. Suppose there exists measurement MQ \u2208 LOCC as in Eq. (1) that perfectly discriminates the given set of states. Then by Theorem 1 of Ref. [11], for each Qi \u2208 M, there exists a continuous path of product operators Qi(s) extending from IH to Qi and lying entirely within ZM. Furthermore, each Qi \u2265 0 identifies without error one of the states in the set, say \u03a8n, or in other words, Tr (Qi\u03a8m) = \u03b4mnqin, which since \u03a8n \u2265 0 as well, means that Qi\u03a8m = 0 = \u03a8mQi for all m 6= n. This implies that \u03a0Qi\u03a0 = qin\u03a8n, for the given fixed n, with qin \u2265 0. Now, from the proof of Theorem 1 in Ref. [11], we know that Qi(s) = \u2211 j cij(s)Qj\nwith cij(s) \u2265 0. This leads to \u03a0Qi(s)\u03a0 = \u2211 j cij(s)\u03a0Qj\u03a0 = \u2211 j \u2211 m qjmcij(s)\u03a8m \u2208 Z\u03a8. Since the path terminates at Qi, and as we\u2019ve seen, \u03a0Qi\u03a0 \u221d \u03a8n for some n, the proof of this theorem is complete. We will use this Theorem in the next section to prove that an unextendible product basis consisting of the minimal number of states cannot be perfectly discriminated using LOCC if the local dimensions are such that the number of states satisfies N \u2265 2(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) + 1. Noting that we can write our positive semidefinite path of operators as Q(s) = K(s)\u2020K(s), the condition in Theorem 2 that Q(s) is diagonal in the partial basis of the |\u03a8m\u3009 is equivalent to orthogonality of the new states, K(s)|\u03a8m\u3009. Thus, we have the following corollary to Theorem 2.\nCorollary 1. If a given set of mutually orthogonal quantum states, |\u03a8m\u3009, can be perfectly discriminated within LOCC, then there exists a continuous path of product operators, K(s), such that for every s, the states K(s)|\u03a8m\u3009 remain orthogonal along the entire path.\nNotice how this generalizes the observation, discussed here in the Introduction, that the initial, local measurement in any LOCC protocol must preserve orthogonality of the states. Here we see instead that for LOCC, orthogonality is preserved along entire continuous paths of operators, and also that while K(s) must be a product (separable measurement) operator, this path need not be piecewise local, so need not correspond to a series of local measurements. The proof of the next result will use an extension of the notion, introduced in [14], of partitions of the states of an unextendible product basis (UPB) amongst the various parties. Note, however, that this theorem is general, being applicable to any set of states, not just UPBs. Let us review these ideas before proceeding to the theorem, itself. An UPB is a set, S, of N mutually orthogonal product states on multipartite Hilbert space H such that there is no other product state on H that is orthogonal to all the original N states in the UPB. In principle, a complete product basis of H is unextendible, but one is usually only concerned with partial bases, such that the N states do not span the complete space H. The following lemma was proved in [14].\nLemma 1. [14] Let \u03c0 be a partition of S into P disjoint subsets equal to the number of parties: S = S1 \u222aS2 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222aSP . Let r\u03b1 = rank{|\u03c8(\u03b1)j \u3009 : |\u03a8j\u3009 \u2208 S\u03b1} be the local rank of subset S\u03b1 as seen by the \u03b1th party. Then S is extendible if and only if there exists a partition \u03c0 such that for all \u03b1 = 1, . . . , P , the local rank of the \u03b1th subset is less than the dimensionality of the \u03b1th party\u2019s Hilbert space. That is to say, S is extendible if and only if there exists \u03c0 such that for all \u03b1, r\u03b1 < d\u03b1.\nThe partitioning introduced in this lemma can be understood as a way of distributing \u201cthe job of being orthogonal to a new product state\u201d [15] among the various parties. If for every such partition, at least one party\u2019s local states\u2014say party \u03b1 with set of local states S\u03b1\u2014span the full local Hilbert space, then there is no state orthogonal to all the states in S\u03b1, and party \u03b1 fails to fulfill its role of being orthogonal to an additional product state. If for every partition at least one party fails in this role, then there is no additional product state orthogonal to all the states in S. In other words, under these circumstances, the original set is unextendible. We are now ready to prove our second necessary condition for perfect state discrimination by LOCC. Theorem 3. Consider any mutually orthogonal set of product states S = { |\u03a8j\u3009 = \u2297 \u03b1 |\u03c8 (\u03b1) j \u3009 } . For each party \u03b1, define the subset of all index pairs, J\u03b1 = { (i, j) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u3008\u03c8(\u03b1)i |\u03c8 (\u03b1) j \u3009 = 0; \u3008\u03c8 (\u03b2) i |\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009 6= 0 \u2200\u03b2 6= \u03b1 } . If for\n6 every party \u03b1 the set of dyads, { |\u03c8(\u03b1)i \u3009\u3008\u03c8 (\u03b1) j | } (i,j)\u2208J\u03b1\n, spans a space of dimension d2\u03b1 \u2212 1, then this set of product states cannot be perfectly discriminated within LOCC.\nThroughout the remainder of this paper, we will refer to kets |\u03c8(\u03b1)j \u3009 as the local states on H\u03b1. The idea of the proof is that when these dyads span a space of dimension d2\u03b1 \u2212 1, there is one and only one operator orthogonal to all of them, that being the identity operator, I\u03b1. If this is true for all parties, there can be no global product operator that is orthogonal to all these global dyads and is close to but not proportional to IH, and then by Theorem 1, perfect discrimination by LOCC is impossible.\nProof. We extend the notion of partitioning to the set of dyads D = {|\u03a8i\u3009\u3008\u03a8j |}j 6=i. Let \u03c0\u0302 be such a partition, yielding D = D1\u222aD2\u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222aDP , which we will understand as a way to distribute the \u201cjob of being orthogonal\u201d to a product operator Q = \u2297 \u03b1Q (\u03b1). That is, given \u03c0\u0302(s), Tr ( Q(\u03b1)(s)|\u03c8(\u03b1)i \u3009\u3008\u03c8 (\u03b1) j | ) = 0 for all |\u03a8i\u3009\u3008\u03a8j | \u2208 D\u03b1.\nBy Theorem 2, if the states of S can be perfectly discriminated within LOCC, then there exists a continuous path of positive semidefinite product operators Q(s) such that for every s, Q(s) is diagonal in the partial basis of the states in S: \u3008\u03a8i|Q(s)|\u03a8j\u3009 = \u03b4ij\u3008\u03a8i|Q(s)|\u03a8i\u3009. Now, for each distinct s, one may assign a different partition \u03c0\u0302(s) to distribute the orthogonality job. However, given that there is a finite number of states, N , there is also a finite number of dyads, N(N \u2212 1), and thus there is a finite number of distinct partitions that can be used here. If for any given partition, each (and every) party \u03b1 is given a set of dyads spanning a subspace of dimension d2\u03b1 \u2212 1, then for that partition there is one and only one operator Q(\u03b1) orthogonal to all of that party\u2019s dyads, and thus there is one and only one operator Q orthogonal to all the multipartite dyads, |\u03a8i\u3009\u3008\u03a8j | for j 6= i. Given there are a finite number of partitions, there are then only a finite number of operators orthogonal to all the multipartite dyads, and there cannot be a continuous path of operators from IH to anywhere. Indeed, given that the dyads have been distributed according to the index sets J\u03b1, each of these local dyads is traceless, and thus orthogonal to the identity operator, I\u03b1. Thus, for each such partition, the only operator orthogonal to these dyads is Q(s) = IH, which is a point and not a path that leaves IH, as is required. There are two points that need clarification here. First, partitioning dyads according to J\u03b1 omits dyads, which are therefore not given to any of the parties. As already noted elsewhere, this is not an issue for our proof because including those additional dyads can only increase the space spanned by the dyads given to any given party, so can only further constrain operators Q(\u03b1)(s) orthogonal to these local dyads. The second point is that there are many partitions that do not conform to J\u03b1. For example, there will generally be partitions such that dyad |\u03a8i\u3009\u3008\u03a8j | is given to party \u03b1 even when the corresponding local states on \u03b1 are not themselves orthogonal. As explained in the next paragraph, we will not need to consider any of these other partitions. The reason we can restrict consideration to those partitions that follow J\u03b1 is that these are the only ones relevant for small enough s. Let us see why this is so. Since this path of operators starts at Q(0) = IH, then by continuity, there exists Q(s) for small enough s which is arbitrarily close to IH. If \u3008\u03c8(\u03b2)i |\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009 6= 0, then for small enough s, \u3008\u03c8(\u03b2)i |Q(\u03b2)(s)|\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009 is also non-vanishing, and |\u03c8 (\u03b2) i \u3009\u3008\u03c8 (\u03b2) j | is not orthogonal to Q(\u03b2)(s). To see this formally, one may measure distances between operators on H\u03b2 by the Frobenius norm, \u2016X\u2016 = \u221a\u2211 k,l |Xkl| 2 \u2265 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u3008\u03c8(\u03b2)i |X |\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009 \u2223\u2223\u2223 for some fixed i, j (no sum).2 Then, for \u2223\u2223\u2223\u3008\u03c8(\u03b2)i |\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 = r \u226b \u01eb > 0 and Q(\u03b2)(s) within \u01eb of I\u03b2 , we have\n\u01eb > \u2225\u2225\u2225I\u03b2 \u2212Q(\u03b2)(s) \u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2265 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u3008\u03c8(\u03b2)i |(I\u03b2 \u2212Q(\u03b2)(s))|\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009 \u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223r \u2212 \u3008\u03c8(\u03b2)i |Q(\u03b2)(s)|\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009 \u2223\u2223\u2223 , (4)\nimplying that \u2223\u2223\u2223\u3008\u03c8(\u03b2)i |Q(\u03b2)|\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2248 r \u226b \u01eb > 0 and Q(\u03b2)(s) is not orthogonal to the corresponding dyad, |\u03c8(\u03b2)j \u3009\u3008\u03c8 (\u03b2) i |. If \u3008\u03c8 (\u03b2) i |\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009 6= 0 for all \u03b2 6= \u03b1, then the job of |\u03a8j\u3009\u3008\u03a8i| being orthogonal to Q(s) for small enough s must be assigned to party \u03b1, and this completes the proof. As a simple illustration of how this works, consider the set of two-qubit states, which can be per-\nfectly discriminated by LOCC, S = {|0\u3009|0\u3009, |0\u3009|1\u3009, |1\u3009|+\u3009, |1\u3009|\u2212\u3009}, with |\u00b1\u3009 = (|0\u3009 \u00b1 |1\u3009)/ \u221a 2. For the\n2 This inequality is obvious when \u3008\u03c8 (\u03b2) i |\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009 = 0, and it is straightforward to show that \u2016X\u2016 \u2265\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u3008\u03c8\n(\u03b2) i |X|\u03c8 (\u03b2) j \u3009\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 also holds for\nany non-orthogonal pair of states.\n7 second party, we have the index set J2 = {(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 3)}. The corresponding dyads are {|0\u3009\u30081|, |1\u3009\u30080|, |+\u3009\u3008\u2212|, |\u2212\u3009\u3008+|}. This set spans a space of dimension d22 \u2212 1 = 3, indicating there is a unique local operator orthogonal to the entire set, that being the identity operator I2. Thus, there is no product operator A\u2297B close to IH that does not destroy orthogonality of the original set S, except possibly those with B \u221d I2. Looking at the first party, J1 = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}, with corresponding dyads, {|0\u3009\u30081|, |1\u3009\u30080|}, which span a space of dimension only 2 < d21 \u2212 1. This leaves party 1 with a range of possible measurement operators close to the identity (anything diagonal in the standard basis is acceptable) and as is fairly obvious, this party can indeed initiate a successful LOCC protocol.\nIf the local parts of dyads |\u03a8m\u3009\u3008\u03a8n|, m 6= n, are to span a subspace of dimension d2\u03b1 \u2212 1 for each party \u03b1, there must be enough pairs of states in the original set to distribute to all parties, N(N\u22121) \u2265\u2211\u03b1(d2\u03b1\u22121) =: T . This provides a lower bound on the number of states, N \u2265 \u2308 1 2 + \u221a T + 14 \u2309 , which is smaller than the minimal number of states in a UPB on the same system. However, we do not know if there exist sets of states that achieve this new lower bound while still exhibiting NLWE, or if a larger number is needed. Additional examples illustrating the power of these ideas will be found in the next section."

Then, each off-diagonal element shows that one of the remaining cj vanishes, and this encompasses all of them. Thus, cj = 0 for all j, and these 8 dyads are linearly independent. Since there is a symmetry between the parties, then by Theorem 3, this completes the proof. Notice that while |\u03a81\u3009 is needed to make this set a full basis, it does not appear in any of the dyads of Eq. (6). Therefore, the set still cannot be perfectly discriminated within LOCC even if this state is omitted. Next, consider the states of the Tiles UPB, which is a subset of the Dominoes (unrotated, all \u03b8j = \u03c0/4), except with |\u03a81\u3009 replaced by |F \u3009,\n|F \u3009 = 1 3 (|0\u3009+ |1\u3009+ |2\u3009)\u2297 (|0\u3009+ |1\u3009+ |2\u3009)\n|\u03a83\u3009 = 1\u221a 2 |0\u3009 \u2297 (|0\u3009 \u2212 |1\u3009) |\u03a85\u3009 = 1\u221a 2 (|0\u3009 \u2212 |1\u3009)\u2297 |2\u3009 |\u03a87\u3009 = 1\u221a 2 |2\u3009 \u2297 (|1\u3009 \u2212 |2\u3009) |\u03a89\u3009 = 1\u221a 2 (|1\u3009 \u2212 |2\u3009)\u2297 |0\u3009. (8)\nWe have,\nTheorem 5. The Tiles UPB of Eq. (8) cannot be perfectly discriminated using LOCC.\nProof. In this case, we can use six of the same dyads as were used for the (rotated) dominoes, the ones in the first three rows of Eq. (6) (but with \u03b8j = \u03c0/4, as noted above). Then, instead of those in the fourth row there, include the local (on the first party) parts of |\u03a85\u3009\u3008F | and |\u03a89\u3009\u3008F |. By following the same argument as was just used in the proof of the preceding theorem, it is easily seen that these are eight linearly independent dyads. Since there is again a symmetry between the parties, the proof is complete."

            "text": "We now turn to the results of Ref. [16] concerning what they have denoted as strong nonlocality without entanglement. We have argued in the Introduction that these results are perhaps not as strong as claimed, or at least, as one might wish them to be. The authors of that paper have not proved that the sets of states discussed in their paper exhibit NLWE, according to how we believe NLWE should be understood, and therefore they have also not proved that they exhibit a stronger version of NLWE, as is their claim. Here, we show that for the first of their sets of states (on a tripartite system), their claims are nonetheless correct, that this set does exhibit NLWE, and we also show that it demonstrates NLWE across all bipartite cuts, therefore also exhibiting the stronger version of NLWE. Defining |j \u00b1 k\u3009 = (|j\u3009 \u00b1 |k\u3009)/ \u221a 2, the set of states on a 3 \u00d7 3\u00d7 3 system, given in Eq. (4) of Ref. [16] as an example of what they call strong nonlocality without entanglement, is\n|\u03a81\u00b1\u3009 = |1\u3009|2\u3009|1\u00b1 2\u3009 |\u03a84\u00b1\u3009 = |1\u3009|3\u3009|1\u00b1 3\u3009 |\u03a87\u00b1\u3009 = |2\u3009|3\u3009|1\u00b1 2\u3009 |\u03a810\u00b1\u3009 = |3\u3009|2\u3009|1\u00b1 3\u3009 (9)\nand cyclic permutations of the local states in Eq. (9)\u2014so that for example, |\u03a82\u00b1\u3009 = |2\u3009|1\u00b12\u3009|1\u3009, and generally |\u03a83j+k,\u00b1\u3009 is obtained by permuting the local states in |\u03a83j+1,\u00b1\u3009 k \u2212 1 times\u2014along with |i\u3009|i\u3009|i\u3009 i = 1, 2, 3. We now demonstrate that this set of states does indeed exhibit strong NLWE, according to our definition. First, we show that this set exhibits NLWE.\n9 Theorem 6. The set of states in Eq. (4) of [16] cannot be perfectly discriminated within LOCC.\nProof. We wish to apply Theorem 3. Toward that end, we seek orthogonal pairs of local states on the first party, such that the corresponding pairs on the other parties are not orthogonal. By simple inspection, one easily finds there are many index pairs which satisfy this condition. We only need to find enough dyads to span a subspace of dimension d2\u03b1\u22121; including more index pairs means more dyads, which cannot shrink the subspace that they span. Select index pairs, (1+, 2+), (1+, 10+), (2+, 5+), (3+, 3\u2212), and (6+, 6\u2212), which lead to 10 distinct dyads (including Hermitian conjugates) that (as explained in the proof of Theorem 3) must be given to the first party, those dyads being |i\u3009\u3008j| for all i 6= j and |1+ i\u3009\u30081\u2212 i|, i = 2, 3. Since we need only 8 linearly independent dyads, we omit the two other dyads that appear, which are |1\u2212 i\u3009\u30081+ i|, i = 2, 3. Consider\n0 = 3\u2211\ni=1\n3\u2211\nj=1 j 6=i\ncij |i\u3009\u3008j|+ c\u20321|1 + 2\u3009\u30081\u2212 2|+ c\u20322|1 + 3\u3009\u30081\u2212 3|. (10)\nIt is almost trivial to show that this is satisfied if and only if all coefficients vanish. First, take the \u30082| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |2\u3009 and \u30083| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |3\u3009 matrix elements of Eq. (10), yielding 0 = c\u20321 and 0 = c\u20322, respectively. Then, the \u3008i| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |j\u3009 matrix element for all j 6= i leads to the conclusion that cij = 0, as well, and we are done. The chosen 8 dyads are linearly independent, and by the symmetry between the three parties, we have verified that the conditions for Theorem 3 hold for the states of Eq. (9). We can also use Theorem 3 to prove this set cannot be discriminated by LOCC even if two of the parties get together and make joint measurements on their combined (two) parts of the tripartite system.\nTheorem 7. The set of states in Eq. (4) of [16] exhibits true strong nonlocality without entanglement.\nProof. Since their combined parts have dimension equal to dBC = 9, the proof here is slightly more challenging than that for Theorem 6, since we need to demonstrate there are d2BC \u2212 1 = 80 linearly independent dyads. Selecting this many dyads out of the hundreds to choose from is difficult to do by hand, but it is easy to write a short computer program that will perform this task for us. We do, indeed, find that there are 80 linearly independent dyads satisfying the conditions of Theorem 3. Given that we\u2019ve already shown that for any one party, there are d2A\u2212 1 = 8 linearly independent such dyads, then because of symmetry between the parties, this completes the proof. Thus, we have shown that this set of states demonstrates what we consider to be a significantly stronger \u201cnonlocality\u201d than was originally shown by the authors of Ref. [16]. We note that the above proof of NLWE, in the case that one views it as a tripartite system, requires only eight linearly independent dyads for each party, and it turns out that a much reduced set of states still exhibits NLWE. It is straightforward to show that the reduced set of 12 states, |\u03a81\u00b1\u3009, |\u03a82\u00b1\u3009, |\u03a83\u00b1\u3009|\u03a810\u00b1\u3009, |\u03a811\u00b1\u3009, |\u03a812\u00b1\u3009, still exhibits nonlocality without entanglement. We have checked numerically, and it turns out that this reduced set does not exhibit (our version of) strong nonlocality without entanglement. However, omitting only the three states |i\u3009|i\u3009|i\u3009, i = 1, 2, 3 does leave a strongly nonlocal set. As another illustration of the power of Theorem 3, we use it in Appendix C to prove that GenTiles1 [14], a bipartite UPB on an n \u00d7 n system for any even n \u2265 4, cannot be perfectly discriminated by LOCC, a result we first obtained recently in [11], where it was necessary to first determine the most general separable POVM that perfectly discriminates the set. Here, by using Theorem 3, we are able to avoid a great deal of effort since with this approach, one need not know anything about what measurements will succeed, all one needs to know is the set of states, itself."

            "text": "We will show in this section that a certain subset of unextendible product bases (UPB) [14] consisting of the minimal number of states\u2014which we will refer to as a minimal UPB\u2014cannot be discriminated perfectly by LOCC. (There is a paper [17] purporting to prove that this is true for any unextendible product basis. We believe their proof is wrong, probably in various places, and explain our reasons for this belief in Appendix D.) When the UPB is on P parties each having local Hilbert space H\u03b1 of dimension d\u03b1, the minimal number of states is given as N = \u2211 \u03b1(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) + 1 [14].\n10\nWe start by showing that for a minimal UPB, every set of d\u03b1 of the local states making up this UPB is linearly independent. Lemma 2. A set of N = \u2211\n\u03b1(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) + 1 pure product states on P parties is an unextendible product basis if and only if for every \u03b1, every set of d\u03b1 of the local states on H\u03b1, of dimension d\u03b1, is linearly independent.\nThe proof can be found in Appendix E. The following lemma will also play an important role.\nLemma 3. Suppose |\u03c8(\u03b1)k \u3009 and linearly independent set {|\u03c6 (\u03b1) kl \u3009}d\u03b1l=1, are states on H\u03b1 of dimension d\u03b1. If operator X is orthogonal to each of the d\u03b1 dyads, |\u03c8(\u03b1)k \u3009\u3008\u03c6 (\u03b1) kl |, for fixed k and l = 1, 2, . . . , d\u03b1, then X has rank strictly smaller than d\u03b1.\nProof. Orthogonality of X to each of the dyads means\n\u3008\u03c6(\u03b1)kl |X |\u03c8 (\u03b1) k \u3009 = 0, (11)\nfor all l. Note that states |\u03c6(\u03b1)kl \u3009 constitute a complete basis of H\u03b1 for each k, so that any state |\u03a6(\u03b1)\u3009 \u2208 H\u03b1 can be written as a linear combination of the |\u03c6(\u03b1)kl \u3009. Multiply Eq. (11) by arbitrary complex numbers, \u00b5l, and sum over l to obtain \u3008\u03a6(\u03b1)|X |\u03c8(\u03b1)k \u3009 = 0. Since |\u03a6(\u03b1)\u3009 is arbitrary, this means that X |\u03c8 (\u03b1) k \u3009 = 0, so X cannot be full rank, and this completes the proof. Now we are ready to prove our desired result, as codified in the following theorem. Theorem 8. Given any unextendible product basis on P parties, S = { |\u03a8m\u3009 = \u2297 \u03b1 |\u03c8 (\u03b1) m \u3009 } , having the minimal number of states, N = \u2211\n\u03b1(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) + 1, with the \u03b1th local Hilbert space H\u03b1 having dimension d\u03b1, if for all \u03b1, d\u03b1 \u2264 \u2211 \u03b2 6=\u03b1(d\u03b2 \u2212 1)+ 1\u2014equivalently, N \u2265 2(d\u03b1 \u2212 1)+ 1\u2014then this set of N multipartite states cannot be perfectly discriminated within LOCC.\nProof. According to Theorem 2 of the previous section, if a set of N orthogonal states |\u03a8m\u3009 can be perfectly discriminated by LOCC, then there exists a continuous path of product operators, Q(s), starting from IH, such that \u3008\u03a8m|Q(s)|\u03a8n\u3009 = 0 for allm 6= n. Restated in terms of dyads, we have that Q(s) must be orthogonal to N(N \u2212 1) = N\u2211\u03b1(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) dyads |\u03a8n\u3009\u3008\u03a8m| for all m 6= n. Let us drop the parameter s and focus on understanding the conditions under which Q = \u2297 \u03b1Q\n(\u03b1) is orthogonal to all these dyads associated with the states of a minimal UPB. More specifically, since we require a continuous path starting at IH, there must be part of this path that consists of full-rank operators, so let us restrict to the case that Q, and therefore each Q(\u03b1), are full rank. We may partition the dyads among the parties, again as a way to distribute the job of \u201cbeing orthogonal\u201d to Q. First, suppose in a given such partition, party \u03b1 is given less than N(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) distinct dyads to which Q(\u03b1) must be orthogonal. Then, there must be another party, say \u03b2, that has been given at least N(d\u03b2\u22121)+1 distinct dyads to which Q(\u03b2) must be orthogonal. Each of these dyads is of the form |\u03c8(\u03b2)k \u3009\u3008\u03c8 (\u03b2) l |, for some k, l. Since there are only N distinct kets |\u03c8(\u03b2)k \u3009 to choose from, there must be at least one k such that |\u03c8 (\u03b2) k \u3009 is the ket appearing in d\u03b2 of the distinct dyads. Otherwise, there is no way to account for all N(d\u03b2 \u2212 1)+ 1 dyads partitioned to this party. Then, by Lemma 2 we see that this set of bras, \u3008\u03c8(\u03b2)l |, spans H\u03b2 , so by Lemma 3, Q(\u03b2) is not full rank. Therefore, since we are seeking full rank Q, we may restrict to partitions that give no one party, \u03b1, less than N(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) distinct dyads. On the other hand, if any party \u03b1 is given more than N(d\u03b1\u22121) distinct dyads, then by the same argument just given, Q cannot be full rank. Therefore, any partition allowing for full rank Q must distribute exactly N(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) distinct dyads to party \u03b1, for every \u03b1. For any such partition allowing for Q to have full rank, we will next identify a set of d2\u03b1 \u2212 1 linearly independent dyads distributed to party \u03b1, for all \u03b1. This implies that for any partition consistent with full rank Q, there is at most one possible Q orthogonal to all d2\u03b1\u22121 dyads. Since all of these dyads are orthogonal to IH, operators proportional to the latter are the only ones of full rank orthogonal to all these dyads and as such, satisfy the constraint that \u03a0Q\u03a0 is diagonal in the (partial) basis of the |\u03a8m\u3009. Therefore, there can be no continuous path of product operators starting from IH and satisfying this constraint, and the proof will be complete once we demonstrate linear independence of d2\u03b1 \u2212 1 of the (local) dyads, for each partition and for each \u03b1.\n11\nNote that since there are P \u2265 2 parties (and there are no UPBs on a two-qubit system), then for all \u03b1, N > d\u03b1 + 1, so there are N(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) > (d\u03b1 + 1)(d\u03b1 \u2212 1) = d2\u03b1 \u2212 1 dyads distributed to each party, \u03b1. In Appendix F, we show that the following set of dyads is linearly independent.\n|\u03c8(\u03b1)1 \u3009\u3008\u03c8 (\u03b1) l |, l = d\u03b1 + 1, . . . , 2d\u03b1 \u2212 1, |\u03c8(\u03b1)l \u3009\u3008\u03c8 (\u03b1) 1 |, l = d\u03b1 + 1, . . . , 2d\u03b1 \u2212 1, |\u03c8(\u03b1)k \u3009\u3008\u03c6 (\u03b1) kl |, k = 2, . . . , d\u03b1; l = 1, . . . , d\u03b1 \u2212 1, (12)\nwhere each |\u03c6(\u03b1)kl \u3009 is one of the |\u03c8 (\u03b1) m \u3009, m 6= k; for each k, no two of the |\u03c6(\u03b1)kl \u3009 correspond to the samem; and in the last line, the |\u03c8(\u03b1)k \u3009 are specifically chosen to be distinct from the |\u03c8 (\u03b1) l \u3009, l = d\u03b1+1, . . . , 2d\u03b1\u22121. Note that such a set of dyads always exists for every partition and for any minimal UPB satisfying N \u2265 2(d\u03b1 \u2212 1)+ 1: as argued above, each |\u03c8(\u03b1)m \u3009 appears as the ket in d\u03b1 \u2212 1 distinct dyads given to party \u03b1, so any choice of |\u03c8(\u03b1)1 \u3009 appears with d\u03b1 \u2212 1 of the |\u03c8 (\u03b1) l \u3009; and given the just-mentioned lower bound on N , there are more than the needed d\u03b1 \u2212 1 other states remaining to be chosen as the |\u03c8(\u03b1)k \u3009, k = 2, . . . , d\u03b1 on the third line, each of which appear in d\u03b1 \u2212 1 distinct dyads, which provides for the |\u03c6(\u03b1)kl \u3009. As discussed in the preceding paragraph, this completes the proof."

            "text": "In summary, we have applied the insights of Ref. [11] to the problem of quantum state discrimination using local operations and classical communication wherein an error is allowed but must vanish in the asymptotic limit. We obtained a lower bound on the probability of error under these circumstances and found that this lower bound provides an estimate of the correct order of magnitude relative to the known optimal error for discriminating the four Bell states. We then proved new necessary conditions that a set of mutually orthogonal states can be perfectly discriminated by LOCC, and provided examples illustrating the power of these conditions, which greatly simplify what has previously been an extremely arduous task, that of determining whether a set of states can be discriminated with error that is vanishingly small. While for quantum state discrimination by LOCC, the approach given in Ref. [11] required knowledge of the precise measurement the parties were trying to implement, a key advance attained here is that they only need to know the set of states they are tasked with discriminating, nothing more.\nThe work we have presented here and in Ref. [11] opens up a wide range of questions for further study. Since the numerical evaluation of our lower bound, Eq. (3), appears to be difficult, it would be of interest for experts to develop methods of addressing this problem. At present, the greatest lower bound that we are aware of for the domino states [2] is perr \u2265 1.9\u00d7 10\u22128 [6]. As such, it would be interesting to know how our lower bound compares to this (perhaps surprisingly) small value.\nOther avenues for further exploration include applying the ideas of Ref. [11] to (i) strengthen those results by demonstrating the need not only for continuous paths to individual measurement outcomes, but to all outcomes of a given measurement simultaneously, which we believe we have found a way to do; (ii) find ways of determining when a quantum channel can be implemented by LOCC, a goal we also believe we are well on the way to achieving; and finally, (iii) determine a lower bound on the error incurred when implementing a given quantum channel by LOCC, say for example, to transform one entangled state to another.\nAcknowledgments \u2014 We wish to thank Dan Stahlke and Jeff Kidder for helpful discussions."

(A1)\nThe third line follows from the fact that maxm Tr ( Q\u0302i\u03a8m ) \u2264 Tr ( Q\u0302i ) , while the fifth line follows from the fact that Tr ( Q\u03022i ) \u2264 [ Tr ( Q\u0302i )]2 for any Q\u0302i \u2265 0, and that 0 \u2264 [ maxm Tr ( Q\u0302i\u03a8m )]2 \u2264\u2211m [ Tr ( Q\u0302i\u03a8m )]2 . In the sixth line, we introduce zi = \u2211 m Tr ( Q\u0302i\u03a8m ) \u03a8m, from which the equality to the preceding line follows from the fact that Tr (\u03a8m\u03a8n) = \u03b4mn. Finally in the seventh line, we introduce the definition of the Frobenius norm, which is \u2016M\u20162 = Tr ( M \u2020M ) = \u2211\nk,l |Mkl| 2 .\nLet us now restrict to MQ \u2208 LOCCN, implemented by any finite-round LOCC protocol. We will represent each such protocol as a tree graph consisting of an arbitrary number of finite branches, each branch itself consisting of a sequence of nodes. Each node \u03b1 corresponds to a POVM element Q\u0303\u03b1 as described elsewhere, and each such element, once normalized to unit trace, lies at a distance R\u0303\u03b1 from the similarly normalized identity operator,\nR\u0303\u03b1 = \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 IH D \u2212 Q\u0303\u03b1 Tr ( Q\u0303\u03b1 ) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 , (A2)\nwith D the overall dimension of H. Since it is straightforward to show that any refinement of a given measurement into rank-1 operators does not increase the error probability, we may assume that the outcomes of MQ are all rank-1 operators, in which case the leaf nodes, l, of the LOCC protocol all lie at a distance R\u0303l = \u221a (D \u2212 1)/D. That is, every branch of the protocol terminates at this distance from IH.\nWe will use the following lemma to inform a truncation of LOCC protocols, see below. Define \u2206(Q, z) =\n\u2016(\u03a0Q\u03a0\u2212 z)/Tr (\u03a0Q\u03a0)\u2016 = \u2225\u2225\u2225(Q\u0302 \u2212 z)/Tr ( Q\u0302 )\u2225\u2225\u2225 and \u2206(Q) := minz\u2208Z\u03a8 \u2206(Q, z), where z is an element of zonotope Z\u03a8, defined in the main text. Note for later reference that every element of Z\u03a8 is diagonal in the (partial) basis of the |\u03a8m\u3009. Then we have Lemma 4. Consider the set PR of all positive semidefinite product operators acting on H and lying at distance R from the identity operator IH, in the sense of Eq. (A2), and suppose that no operator in that set lies closer than \u2206R from zonotope Z\u03a8. That is,\n\u2206R = min Q\u2208PR z\u2208Z\u03a8 \u2206(Q, z) = min Q\u2208PR \u2206(Q). (A3)\n13\nSuppose, in addition, there exists node Q\u0303p, parent of its child node Q\u0303s, both lying along a branch of an\nLOCC protocol implementing measurement MQ and such that R\u0303p \u2264 R and R\u0303s \u2265 R. Then, \u2206 ( Q\u0303p ) \u2265 \u2206R or \u2206 ( Q\u0303s ) \u2265 \u2206R, or both.\nProof. As noted in the main text, the minimum over z \u2208 Z\u03a8 is achieved at z = \u2211 m Tr ( Q\u0302\u03a8m ) \u03a8m = \u2211 m \u03b7mTr (Q\u03a8m)\u03a8m, for any Q, so in the basis of states |\u03a8\u3009, Q\u0302\u2212 z is the same as Q\u0302 but with its diagonal elements set to zero (note that states |\u03a8m\u3009 may constitute an incomplete basis here, but this is not a problem since with the use of \u03a0 in its definition, the support of Q\u0302 is confined to the span of that incomplete basis).\nConsider the line segment, Q(x) = (1 \u2212 x)Q\u0303p + xQ\u0303s, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, which connects Q\u0303p to Q\u0303s. Since this is a continuous function of x, and since R\u0303p \u2264 R and R\u0303s \u2265 R, there exists y in the range 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1 such that Q(y) is at distance R from IH, again in the sense of Eq. (A2). Q(y) \u2208 PR because we are considering an LOCC protocol, for which Q\u0303p and Q\u0303s differ only in one party\u2019s local operator. To prove the lemma, assume \u2206(Q\u0303p) < \u2206R and \u2206(Q\u0303s) < \u2206R, which we will see leads to the condition that \u2206(Q(y)) < \u2206R, contradicting the definition of \u2206R as the minimum over Q \u2208 PR. We have,\n\u2206(Q(y)) = min z \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 Q\u0302(y)\u2212 z Tr ( Q\u0302(y) ) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n= \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 Q\u0302(y)\u2212 z(y) Tr ( Q\u0302(y) ) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 , (A4)\nwith Q\u0302(y) = \u03a0Q(y)\u03a0 and\nz(y) = \u2211\nm\nTr ( Q\u0302(y)\u03a8m ) \u03a8m\n= (1 \u2212 y) \u2211\nm\nTr ( Q\u0302p\u03a8m ) \u03a8m + y \u2211\nm\nTr ( Q\u0302s\u03a8m ) \u03a8m\n= (1 \u2212 y)zp + yzs, (A5)\nwhere Q\u0302p,s = \u03a0Q\u0303p,s\u03a0, and zp, zs are defined in analogy to z(y). This gives [ Tr ( Q\u0302(y) )]2 \u2206(Q(y))2 = \u2225\u2225\u2225(1\u2212 y)(Q\u0302p \u2212 zp) + y(Q\u0302s \u2212 zs) \u2225\u2225\u2225 2\n= (1\u2212 y)2 [ Tr ( Q\u0302p )]2 \u22062p + y 2 [ Tr ( Q\u0302s )]2 \u22062s + 2y(1\u2212 y)Tr ([ Q\u0302p \u2212 zp ] [ Q\u0302s \u2212 zs ]) .\n(A6)\nNoting that the inner product of unit vectors cannot exceed unity, we have that\nTr ([ Q\u0302p \u2212 zp ] [ Q\u0302s \u2212 zs ]) \u2264 \u221a Tr ([ Q\u0302p \u2212 zp ]2) Tr ([ Q\u0302s \u2212 zs ]2)\n= Tr ( Q\u0302p ) Tr ( Q\u0302s ) \u2206p\u2206s, (A7)\nand then from Eq. (A6) that\n[ Tr ( Q\u0302(y) )]2 \u2206(Q(y))2 \u2264 [ (1\u2212 y)Tr ( Q\u0302p ) \u2206p + yTr ( Q\u0302s ) \u2206s ]2 (A8)\nBy assumption, \u2206p < \u2206R and \u2206s < \u2206R. This leads to the conclusion that\n[ Tr ( Q\u0302(y) )]2 \u2206(Q(y))2 < [ (1\u2212 y)Tr ( Q\u0302p ) + yTr ( Q\u0302s )]2 \u22062R\n= [ Tr ( Q\u0302(y) )]2 \u22062R, (A9)\n14\nor, \u2206(Q(y)) < \u2206R, a contradiction. This completes the proof.\nThis lemma provides a way to truncate a given finite-round LOCC protocol such that every branch that reaches a distance R \u2264 \u221a (D \u2212 1)/D from IH is left with a (new) leaf node, Q\u0303\u03b1, for which \u03a0Q\u0303\u03b1\u03a0 is a distance of at least \u2206R from Z\u03a8. Recall that, since we can restrict consideration to rank-1 measurements, all leaf nodes lie at distance R = \u221a (D \u2212 1)/D, and every branch corresponds to a continuous path starting\nat distance R = 0. Therefore, for each branch, identify the first node Q\u0303\u03b1 that is a distance at least R from IH. Truncate this branch at its parent Qp, unless Q\u0303\u03b1 is at distance equal to R or \u2206p < \u2206R, in either of which cases, truncate at Q\u0303\u03b1, for which the lemma tells us \u2206\u03b1 \u2265 \u2206R. Now we have a truncated tree for which\n\u2206\u03b1 = \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u03a0Q\u0303\u03b1\u03a0\u2212 z\u0303\u03b1 Tr ( Q\u0303\u03b1 ) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2265 \u2206R (A10)\nfor all leaf nodes, Q\u0303\u03b1, in the truncation, and z\u0303\u03b1 = \u2211 m \u03b7mTr ( Q\u0303\u03b1\u03a8m ) \u03a8m. Each such leaf node has a set of descendants in the original protocol, which we index as L\u03b1 = {l|Ql is a leaf node descendant of Q\u0303\u03b1 in the original protocol}, unless Q\u0303\u03b1 is itself a leaf node in the original protocol, in which case we instead define L\u03b1 = {l|Ql is the leaf node Q\u0303\u03b1 in the original protocol}. Then, Q\u0303\u03b1 = \u2211 l\u2208L\u03b1 Ql, and from (A1) we have\nperr \u2265 \u2211\nl\nTr ( \u03a02Ql )\n2\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u03a0Ql\u03a0\u2212 zl Tr (\u03a02Ql) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 2\n\u2265 \u2211\n\u03b1\n\u2211\nl\u2208L\u03b1\n\u2016\u03a0Ql\u03a0\u2212 zl\u20162 2Tr (\u03a02Ql)\n= \u2211\n\u03b1\n\u2225\u2225\u2211 i\u2208L\u03b1 (\u03a0Ql\u03a0\u2212 zl) \u2225\u22252\n2 \u2211\ni\u2208L\u03b1 Tr (\u03a02Ql)\n= \u2211\n\u03b1\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u03a0Q\u0303\u03b1\u03a0\u2212 z\u0303\u03b1 \u2225\u2225\u2225 2\n2Tr ( \u03a02Q\u0303\u03b1 )\n= \u2211\n\u03b1\nTr ( \u03a02Q\u0303\u03b1 )\n2 \u2206\u03b1\n\u2265 \u2211\n\u03b1\nTr ( \u03a02Q\u0303\u03b1 )\n2 \u2206R\n= 1\n2 min Q\u2208PR z\u2208Z\u03a8\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u03a0Q\u03a0\u2212 z Tr (\u03a02Q) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 2\n(A11)\nwhere the second (and slightly indirectly, last) lines follow since the sum over leaves descended from all of the\nQ\u0303\u03b1 includes all leaves in the original protocol; the step going from line 2 to line 3 is proven in Appendix B; and z\u0303\u03b1 is defined below Eq. (A10). The second-to-last line follows from Lemma 4, while the last line is a result of the fact that Q\u0303\u03b1 is a product operator (since it is an intermediate outcome of an LOCC protocol), along with \u2211\n\u03b1 Q\u0303\u03b1 = IH.\nThus, we\u2019ve derived the expression in Theorem 1, which lower bounds perr for any finite number of rounds, r.

Following a bit of guesswork and playing around numerically looking for patterns on systems with several smallish values of n, we have identified the following set of n2 \u2212 1 linearly independent, traceless dyads on the first party.\n(1) |i\u3009\u3008j| i, j = 0, . . . , n\u2212 1; j 6= i, i+ n 2 (mod n) (2) |f\u3009\u3008hkm| and |hkm\u3009\u3008f | k = 0,m = 1, . . . , n\n2 \u2212 1 and k = 1,m = 1; and |f\u3009\u3008hk1| k = 2, . . . ,\nn\n2\n(3) |hkm\u3009\u3008hkl| k = 1,m = 1, l = 2, . . . , n\n2 \u2212 1 and k = 1,m = 2, l = 1\n(4) |h01\u3009\u3008n/2|. (C3)\nSet (1) corresponds to orthogonality of |Him\u3009, |Hjl\u3009, which are not orthogonal on the second party for at least some values of m, l\u2014these are n(n\u22122) dyads; set (2) corresponds to orthogonality of |F \u3009, |Hkm\u3009, which again, are not orthogonal on the second party\u2014these are 2(n/2 \u2212 1) + 2 + n/2 \u2212 1 = 3n/2 \u2212 1; set (3) is for |Hkm\u3009, |Hkl\u3009 (same k)\u2014n/2\u2212 1 dyads; and set (4) is for H01, |Vn\n2 m\u3009\u2014which is one last dyad. The total\nnumber of these dyads is n2 \u2212 1, as required, and none of these are orthogonal on the second party. They are linearly independent if there is no set of non-zero coefficients satisfying the following equation.\n0 = \u2211\ni,j=0 j 6=i,i+n/2 (mod n)\ncij |i\u3009\u3008j|+ n/2\u22121\u2211\nm=1\n(f0m|f\u3009\u3008h0m|+ f \u20320m|h0m\u3009\u3008f |) + f11|f\u3009\u3008h11|+ f \u203211|h11\u3009\u3008f |\n+\nn/2\u2211\nk=2\nfk1|f\u3009\u3008hk1|+ n/2\u22121\u2211\nm=2\ng1m|h11\u3009\u3008h1m|+ g21|h12\u3009\u3008h11|+ h|h01\u3009\u3008n/2|. (C4)\nWe next show that this latter equation is satisfied if and only if all its coefficients vanish, which proves that the set of dyads listed in Eq. (C3) are linearly independent, spanning a space of dimension n2 \u2212 1. By the symmetry of the parties for GenTiles1, this conclusion holds for the second party, as well. Thus, by Theorem 3, GenTiles1 cannot be perfectly discriminated within LOCC for any value of n.\n17\nWe start by taking the \u3008n/2 + l| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |n/2 + l\u3009 matrix elements of Eq. (C3) for l = 1, . . . , n/2\u2212 1. Since for these values of l, \u3008n/2 + l|hkm\u3009 = 0 for k = 0, 1, and since the terms involving cij only include non-diagonal dyads (j 6= i), these matrix elements of Eq. (C4) yield\n0 =\nn/2\u2211\nk=2\nfk1\u3008hk1|n/2 + l\u3009 = n/2\u2211\nk=l+1\nfk1\u03c9 k\u2212l, (C5)\nand we have used the facts that \u3008hk1|n/2 + l\u3009 vanishes unless k \u2264 n/2 + l \u2264 k + n/2\u2212 1 (mod n), in which case it is equal to \u03c9k\u2212n/2\u2212l, and \u3008i|f\u3009 = 1 for all i. Beginning with l = n/2\u2212 1, this reduces to fn/2,1 = 0. Then, l = n/2 \u2212 2 yields fn/2\u22121,1 = 0, and continuing on step-by-step, reducing l by unity each time, we find that fk1 = 0 for all k = 2, . . . , n/2. Noting that the terms involving cij also do not include j = i+ n/2 (mod n), we next take \u3008n/2| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |0\u3009 to obtain\n0 =\nn/2\u22121\u2211\nm=1\nf0m + f \u2032 11\u03c9 \u22121, (C6)\nand then \u3008n/2 + l| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |l\u3009, l = 1, . . . , n/2\u2212 1 to obtain\n0 =\nn/2\u22121\u2211\nm=1\nf0m\u03c9 \u2212ml + f11\u03c9 1\u2212l. (C7)\nUsing \u2211n/2\u22121\nl=0 \u03c9 \u2212ml = 0 for all m 6= 0, we can add Eq. (C6) to the sum of all versions (different l) of Eq. (C7)\nto obtain f \u203211 = f11\u03c9 2. Similarly, from \u30080| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |n/2\u3009 we get\n0 =\nn/2\u22121\u2211\nm=1\nf \u20320m + f11\u03c9 + h, (C8)\nand from \u3008l| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |n/2 + l\u3009, l = 1, . . . , n/2\u2212 1,\n0 =\nn/2\u22121\u2211\nm=1\nf \u20320m\u03c9 ml + f \u203211\u03c9 l\u22121 =\nn/2\u22121\u2211\nm=1\nf \u20320m\u03c9 ml + f11\u03c9 l+1. (C9)\nAdding Eq. (C8) and all n/2\u2212 1 instances of Eq. (C9) leaves h = 0. Looking now at diagonal element, \u30080| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |0\u3009, we have\n0 =\nn/2\u22121\u2211\nm=1\n(f0m + f \u2032 0m) . (C10)\nAdding Eq. (C10) and all instances of Eq. (C7) and Eq. (C9), we obtain\n0 =\nn/2\u22121\u2211\nl=0\nn/2\u22121\u2211\nm=1\n( f0m\u03c9 \u2212ml + f \u20320m\u03c9 ml ) + n/2\u22121\u2211\nl=1\nf11\u03c9 ( \u03c9l + \u03c9\u2212l ) . (C11)\nwhich reduces to 0 = \u22122f11\u03c9, so f11 = 0, implying (see below Eq. (C7)) f \u203211 = 0. Now Eq. (C7) can be written (with f11 = 0) as M ~f0 = ~0, with the elements of ~f0 being (~f0)m = f0m, and those of M are given by Mlm = \u03c9\n\u2212ml, m, l 6= 0. If we add a column of all ones to obtain matrix M \u2032, then it is straightforward to see that M \u2032M \u2032\u2020 is proportional to the (n/2 \u2212 1)-dimensional identity operator. Thus, the rank of M \u2032 is n/2\u2212 1. However, the sum of all columns of M \u2032 vanishes, implying that the column rank of M \u2032 is the same as that of M . This, in turn, implies that the rank of M is also n/2 \u2212 1, so M is invertible. Therefore, we have that ~f0 = ~0, and f0m = 0 for all m = 1, . . . , n/2\u2212 1. Similarly, Eq. (C9) can be written as M ~f \u20320 = 0, with the same M and ( ~f \u20320)m = f \u2032 0m, and thus f \u2032 0m = 0 for all m = 1, . . . , n/2\u2212 1, as well. Thus, the only nonzero coefficients left are the c\u2019s and g\u2019s.\n18\nFor the g\u2019s, consider all remaining diagonal elements of our constraint equations, those not previously used in the preceding arguments, \u3008l| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |l\u3009, l = 1, . . . , n/2\u2212 1. Given our preceding results, these yield\n0 =\nn/2\u22121\u2211\nm=2\ng1m\u03c9 \u2212(m\u22121)l + g21\u03c9 l. (C12)\nDefining ~gT = ( g21 g1,n/2\u22121 g1,n/2\u22122 . . . g13 g12 ) , this last equation may be written as M\u2217~g, with M the same matrix as has appeared above. Therefore, each entry of ~g vanishes, and the only nonzero coefficients remaining are the cij . That is,\n0 = \u2211\ni,j=0 j 6=i,i+n/2 (mod n)\ncij |i\u3009\u3008j|, (C13)\nand it is clear that cij = 0 for all remaining i, j, as well. Thus, we have that Eq. (C4) can be satisfied if and only if all of the coefficients appearing there vanish, showing that the set of dyads in Eq. (C3) is linearly independent, which is what we set out to prove."

It is all well and good to use the polar decomposition of S = EU to obtain E \u2265 0, but this implies S = \u03bb(U + \u03b4\u2032A\u2032), and there is no reason that (with the starting point being S) the polar decomposition of A\u2032 should yield the same U as that for S. Put more simply, E \u2265 0 being close to (proportional to) the identity operator only means that the operator A, seen above, is small; to maintain generality, one must allow for indefinite (and even negative semidefinite) A. In other words, it is wrong to assume that A is positive semidefinite. More importantly, the inequality in Eq. (4) is unjustified, even if one maximizes over the absolute value of the off-diagonal matrix element of E\u2020E, instead of (as it is written in their paper) maximizing over the off-diagonal matrix element itself (which may not be a real number, implying that this maximization makes no sense). The reason is that off-diagonal elements of positive operators (such as A\u2020A in this equation) need not be positive (this problem arises even when considering the absolute value of the off-diagonal matrix element, as we have just suggested must be done). Indeed, these off-diagonal elements may well be complex numbers. Therefore, the inequality in their Eq. (4) could very easily be in the opposite direction, thus failing to provide the critical lower bound on the degree to which the states remain orthogonal. The argument given in Ref. [17] has been criticized previously [7] for a different technical point, a criticism that we do not understand. We do take issue with that same technical point, however, but for different reasons. Below Eq. (16) of Ref. [17], for the case cN \u2192 0, the claim that Eqs. (5) and (6) lead to \u01eb \u2192 0 appears to have no basis. It is not entirely clear how they arrive at this conclusion, but they seem to be assuming that if the off-diagonal elements of O(N) all vanish, then its diagonal elements must all be equal to each other, an assumption for which we see no justification. In any case, if their Eq. (4) is wrong, as we have suggested above, then it is almost certain that the analogous Eq. (15) is also wrong, calling into question the validity of the critical Eq. (16). Finally, given the fact that there are several apparent erroneous assumptions made in the proof\u2014along with numerous apparent typographical errors and omissions of detailed explanations of their reasoning\u2014one is left with little confidence in their conclusions, even if one could follow the proof in detail, which is not an easy task.\n19"

            "text": "Proof. We prove the \u201conly if\u201d direction by way of contradiction. Thus, suppose we have a minimal UPB and there exists party \u03b1 and a linearly dependent set of d\u03b1 local states, say {|\u03c8(\u03b1)m \u3009}d\u03b1m=1. Then, there exists a partition of the entire set of N states such that {|\u03a8m\u3009}d\u03b1m=1 are placed with party \u03b1, and all the other parties, \u03b2, are each given d\u03b2 \u2212 1 states. Note that for every party, the local states corresponding to this partition fail to span the entire local Hilbert space. Therefore, for each party \u03b2, we can identify one additional local state, |\u03c6(\u03b2)\u3009 orthogonal to all the d\u03b2 \u2212 1 local states apportioned to party \u03b2 for \u03b2 6= \u03b1, and since the d\u03b1 local states partitioned to party \u03b1 also do not span the local Hilbert space, we can do the same for party \u03b1 with state |\u03c6(\u03b1)\u3009. Taking the tensor product of these P local states, we obtain a product state \u2297\u00b5 |\u03c6(\u00b5)\u3009, orthogonal to all N of the original states of the UPB, extending the UPB and contradicting the fact that it is a UPB to begin with. This completes the proof of the only if part. To prove the other direction, simply notice that for every partition of the states among the parties, there is at least one party that is given at least d\u03b1 local states. By assumption, the set of states given to that party is linearly independent, spanning H\u03b1, and thus, there can be no state on H\u03b1 orthogonal to those d\u03b1 local states. Therefore, one cannot extend the original set of states by adding one more orthogonal product state. That is, the set is unextendible."
