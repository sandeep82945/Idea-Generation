It consists of a Saturnand two Jupiter-mass planets in low-eccentric orbits resembling the Earth-MarsJupiter configuration in the Solar system, as well as the close-in warm Neptune with a mass of ' 14 Earth masses.

The best-fit Newtonian model is characterized by moderate eccentricities of the most massive planets below 0.1 with small uncertainties ' 0.02. It is close but meaningfully separated from the 2e:1b mean motion resonance of the Saturn-Jupiter-like pair, but may be close to weak three-body MMRs. The system appears rigorously stable over a safely wide region of parameter space covering uncertainties of several \u03c3. The system stability is robust to a five-fold increase in the minimal masses, consistent with a wide range of inclinations, from ' 20\u25e6 to 90\u25e6. This means that all planetary masses are safely below the brown dwarf mass limit. We found a weak statistical indication of the likely system inclination I ' 20\u25e6\u201330\u25e6. With the well constrained orbital solution, we also investigate the structure of hypothetical debris disks, which are analogs of the Main Belt and Kuiper Belt, and may naturally occur in this system.",

            "text": "HD 160691 (\u00b5 Arae, GJ 691) is a bright (V = 5.15 mag) Sun-like, main-sequence G3IV-V dwarf monitored in a few long-term, precision radial velocity (RV) surveys. The Anglo-Australian Telescope team (AAT, UCLES spectrometer) discovered its Jupitermass companion HD 160691b in about of 630 days orbit (Butler et al. 2001), and Jones et al. (2002) found a linear trend in the RV data indicating a second, more distant planet. The star was also observed in the Geneva Planet Search program with CORALIE spectrometer. McCarthy et al. (2004) determined the orbital period of the outermost planet HD 160691c ' 3000 days and large eccentricity ec \u223c 0.57, however rendering the system unstable. The same year, Santos et al. (2004) detected ' 14 Earth-mass planet HD 160691d in ' 9.6 d orbit with HARPS spectrometer, achieving precision ' 1 m/s, actually below the RV variability (aka stellar jitter) induced by the Sun-like stars themselves. Furthermore, Butler et al. (2006) published 108 new observations of HD 160691, spanning about of 7.5 yr, made after AAT UCLES update, also approaching the measurement uncertainty below 1 m s\u22121 at the end of the observational window. Shortly, Pepe et al. (2007) published RVs from their HARPS followup, and announced the discovery of the fourth, Saturn-mass planet in the system. In parallel,\nGoz\u0301dziewski et al. (2007) independently used genetic algorithms to re-analyse data in the Butler et al. (2006) catalogue, and they found a very similar solution with small eccentricity orbits, also including the fourth planet with the orbital period' 307 days. That planet \u201chided\u201d in the RV signal, because this period is approximately two times shorter as that of the firstly detected planet HD 160691b. Such a planet was unexpected in the paradigm of characterizing planets in order correlated with their RV variability. Goz\u0301dziewski et al. (2007) concluded that the four-planet system may be long term stable in a wide range of the outermost period. However, it could not be constrained very well at that time, in ' 3000\u20135000 days range.\nSince then, the star has continued to be RV-monitored. The HARPS measurements are now publicly available in the RV catalogue from archival spectra carefully reduced by Trifonov et al. (2020). Also, very recently Benedict et al. (2022) published additional 180 measurements from the UCLES spectrometer. The data altogether span 17.3 years (' 6318 days), between epochs JD 2450915.29 and JD 2457273.2878. Benedict et al. (2022) aimed to derive the new solution for the system based on combined RVs with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) astrometry. They investigated possible astrometric signals of the planets. They conclude that the residuals ' 1-2 mas to the canonical 5-parameter astrometric\n\u00a9 2022 RAS\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n04 54\n2v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .E\nP] 2\n2 Se\np 20\n22\nmodel contain marginal or no evidence for any of the planets in the HD 160691 system, making it possible only to constrain lower masses of the planets to 4-7mJup (i.e., 2-3 times larger than the minimal masses estimated with the RVs).\nFurthermore, Benedict et al. (2022) report their updated Keplerian RV solution including the Saturn-mass planet as catastrophically unstable. They conclude that a notorious instability problem of the system remains unsolved, invoking Pepe et al. (2007); Laskar & Petit (2017); Agnew et al. (2018) and Timpe et al. (2013). This renewed our interest in the dynamics of HD 160691 system, given simultaneously our earlier, extensive investigations (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2003; Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2005), and the results in (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2007). We found quite an opposite conclusion that the four-planet architecture, and moderate eccentricity of all planets is crucial to maintain the long-term stability of the system. Actually, we found in (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2007) that the 3- planet model involving only two outer Jovian planets is localised at the very border of dynamical stability, with planets in higheccentricity orbits, and such a feature indicated that the adopted model was incomplete or incorrect.\nExtending the RV time series puts the long-term monitored planetary systems deeper in the stability zone. A recent discussion of this heuristic effect can be found in (Stalport et al. 2022). What is more, not only the RV data covers twice the time range in earlier work. The most accurate HARPS data recently been independently reprocessed using a new RV pipeline by (Trifonov et al. 2020). They discovered and removed various systematic errors in a large sample of spectra. In some cases, they claim, the new RVs with improved accuracy can lead to orbital solutions different or more accurate from those found so far, including the hope of detecting additional planets. All of this gives us ample opportunity to test earlier predictions. Our goal is also to update the system\u2019s position in stability diagrams and statistics of multiple systems, studied for example by Timpe et al. (2013) and Laskar & Petit (2017).\nIn addition to explaining this qualitative discrepancy between the results in (Benedict et al. 2022) and in (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2007) the motivation for this work is to answer several open questions which have not been previously addressed in the literature.\nSince that the current RV data covers almost twice the observational window since 2006, we want to constrain the orbit of Jupiter\u2019s outermost planet. It was determined with a large uncertainty of 700 days reported in (Pepe et al. 2007) and an even larger uncertainty of \u00b11300 days in (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2007).\nAlso, it is known that a sufficiently long interval of RVs data makes it possible to detect gravitational interactions between the planets (e.g. Laughlin & Chambers 2001). Until now, the RVs of \u00b5 Arae have been modeled in terms of a Keplerian parameterization of the orbital elements, since the interactions of its planets were not measurable at the time. In this kinematic approach, the inclination of the system remains completely unbounded. However, the most accurate Newtonian model can break the mass-inclination degeneracy, or at least constrain the masses of the planets indirectly through the stability requirement.\nOur goal is also to resolve the open question of whether the inner Saturn-Jupiter planet pair is involved in the 2e:1b MMR, or whether it is only close to this resonance. As far as this is concerned, the conclusions in both (Pepe et al. 2007) and (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2007) were uncertain, as both types (resonance or nearresonance) of solutions were possible. However, this is crucial for explaining the apparent excess of planet pairs near low-order resonances (e.g., Petrovich et al. 2013; Marzari 2018, and references therein). The detailed characterization of multiple planetary sys-\ntems, including their orbital resonances, is one of the fundamental problems from the point of view of the theory of planet formation and for explaining their observed orbital architectures.\nIf our early predictions in (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2007) hold, and we find a dynamically stable orbital architecture for the planets, it may be possible to study the structure of debris disks in the system, particularly in the broad zone between 1.5 au and 5.2 au, and beyond the outermost planet. According to the packed planetary systems (PPS) hypothesis (Barnes & Greenberg 2007, and references therein), smaller planets may exist in the system, but below the current RV detection level, approximately 1 m s\u22121, which correspond to the Earth\u2019s mass range.\nFinally, the highly hierarchical configuration of the HD 160691 planets imposes numerical problems in studying the long-term stability of the system, either through direct numerical integrations or by using the fast indicator approach, which is preferred in this work. Recall that the system contains a warm Neptune in an orbit of 9.6 days, as well as a very distant companion in an orbit of 4100 days, forcing a huge reduction in the discretization step size. To solve this problem, we propose a new numerical algorithm called REM (Panichi et al. 2017), which we proved to be a close analogue of the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE). In this work, we compare the results of this fast indicator with the well-tested and widespread MEGNO (Cincotta et al. 2003; Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2001). We show that despite simplicity of the algorithm, the REM indicator yields 1:1 dynamic maps compared to MEGNO and still outperforms the later variational algorithm in terms of CPU overhead.\nWe attempt to answer the questions posed above from the perspective of both updated RV time series and constraints provided with astrometric observations, as well as new statistical formulations of the RV model, dynamic and computational tools that have emerged over the time since the studies of Goz\u0301dziewski et al. (2007) and Pepe et al. (2007); we note that Benedict et al. (2022) also modeled the RV using the former, now somewhat \u201coutdated\u201d approach.\nPlanets discovered in the \u00b5 Arae system are named in different ways. Here we adopt three designations: the first one is based on the star name, as the central object and subsequent Roman letters (\u201cb\u201d, \u201cc\u201d, \u201cd\u201d, and so on) attributed to the planetary companions in the chronological order of their discovery (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2007). The second method is to enlist the planets according to their distance from the star, with digits \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, and so on. Finally, we use the names attributed to the planets by the International Astronomical Union (2015) in the NameExoWorld campaign1, among firstly discovered 19 extrasolar planetary systems. They were inspired by characters from the famous Don Quixote book by Miguel de Cervantes. So the \u00b5 Arae system is composed of the host star Cervantes (HD 160691), and planetary companions HD 160691d (Dulcinea, planet \u201c1\u201d), HD 160691e (Rocinante, planet \u201c2\u201d), HD 160691b (Quijote, planet \u201c3\u201d), and HD 160691c (Sancho, planet \u201c4\u201d), respectively.\nThe paper is structured as follows. After this Introduction, we describe data sources used for this study in Sect. 2. We discuss planet detection limits, based on the astrometric HST data and their analysis reported in (Benedict et al. 2022), as well as our independent simulations of the astrometric signal. In Sect. 2.3 we briefly recall essential details on the RV modeling in terms of Keplerian and Newtonian parameterization of the initial conditions (ICs) for"

They made a detailed reduction of the observations and reported the results. Overall, the accuracy of the astrometric measurements ' 0.6\u20130.7 mas, and the residuals to 5-elements canonical astrometric solution (no companions present) are estimated on the level of ' 1\u20132 mas. However, the periodogram analysis of these residuals, which might contain unmodeled factors and a signature of companions, does not show any significant period overlapping with the known orbital variability from the RV analysis. Unfortunately, also analysis of the proper mean motion based on the HST measurements by Benedict et al. (2022), and Hipparcos (van Leeuwen 2007) by Brandt (2021), respectively, relative to the estimates in the Gaia DR3 catalogue indicate that there is a marginal or lack of a measurable difference between the proper mean motion at the initial and the final epochs for 25 years. That means there is difficult to detect a significant acceleration caused by the planetary companions, which was used, for instance, to astrometrically constrain the mass of the innermost planet HR 8799e in (Brandt et al. 2021).\nGiven the negative detection of any of the companions, Benedict et al. (2022) estimated the lower mass limits for HD 160691b,e,c as (4.3,7.0,4.4)mJup, respectively, which could be consistent with a low inclination of the system below I = 30\u25e6. Moreover, they claim that inclinations in their sample of multipleplanetary systems are biased towards small values, I' 30\u25e6 and less. As we show below, for HD 160691 this can be verified based of the RVs data alone.\nAlthough the parallax of the system is large, \u03a0 ' 64 mas, the relatively small semi-major axes of the planets, compared to other astrometrically detected systems, translate to weak astrometric signals. To illustrate this effect, and to predict if the system may be characterised astrometrically by the ongoing Gaia mission, we simulated detection limits with the Intermediate Astrometric Data (IAD) from the Hipparcos and Gaia surveys. For this purpose, we used the htof package by Brandt et al. (2021) which makes it possible to combine data from both missions, including IAD for Gaia simulated with the help of Gaia Observation Forecast Tool (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021, GOST).\nThe results are illustrated in Fig. 1. The left panel is for the detection limits for outer, massive planets assuming that the inclination I = 90\u25e6 and masses are minimal (a less favorable scenario). Then, assuming a superior mean accuracy of ' 96 Gaia measurements scheduled by the end of 2022, with the mean uncertainty \u03c3' 50 mas in the anticipated DR4 catalogue, and IADs from Hipparcos, we would easily detect the outermost pair of Jupiters. Note that the border of detection zone marks the astrometric detection criterion of \u2206\u03c72 > 30 by Perryman (Brandt et al. 2021), when\n\u2206\u03c72 = 0 applies to the free motion of the star. However, the inner Saturn-like planet remains deep below the detection limit (blueshaded region).\nThe situation is dramatically worse, if a hypothetical data accuracy ' 0.7 mas is close to the HST FGS astrometry. Even if the system inclination is statistically most likely for I = 60\u25e6 or smaller, consistent with the inclination bias reported in (Benedict et al. 2022), I = 30\u25e6, scaling the minimal masses by a factor of ' 20% and ' 100%, respectively, only the outermost planet could be barely detected with the astrometric time-series.\nUnfortunately, these arguments and simulations leave little hope that a re-analysis of the available astrometric data may change the results and conclusions in (Benedict et al. 2022) and (Brandt 2021). Therefore we abandoned the HST astrometry from further analysis, and we focused on the RV observations only."

            "text": "We considered two slightly different sets of the RV measurements for \u00b5 Arae available in public archives and sources.\nThe RV data set D1 consists of 380 measurements spanning 6317.5 days. They are collected with three instruments: CORALIE (DCORALIE), UCLES (DUCLES) and HARPS (DHARPS1,2). This set is literally the same as in Benedict et al. (2022), and we obtained it from the author (private communication). In densely sampled parts of the observational window, the data were binned if there was more than one measurement made during a night. The mean uncertainty is different for individual spectrometers, and varies between \u3008\u03c3\u3009 \u223c 1 m s\u22121 up to a several m s\u22121 for CORALIE. Moreover, Benedict et al. (2022) considered HARPS observations in two disjoint sets: from Pepe et al. (2007) and the second part of the time-series after that date from (Trifonov et al. 2020). They attributed different RV offsets to these sets.\nWe also compiled a second data set D2. Trifonov et al. (2020) derived the RV velocities from spectra obtained prior\u2013 and post\u2013 the HARPS upgrade in May 2015, and corrected them for various systematics and instrumental effects. Since the available data for HD 160691 contains effectively only two post-upgrade measurements made in nights of June and July 2015, we skipped these points from the orbital analysis. It would be difficult to account for two free parameters, \u03c3 f and V0 \u2261 V0,UCLES, to be statistically determined with the RV subset comprising of only two datum. Moreover, because the post-upgrade HARPS epochs overlap with UCLES measurements, skipping them unlikely may change the model results. We also get rid of two free parameters. Similarly to Benedict et al. (2022), we also binned densely sampled measurements, but with a smaller interval of 0.1 days. Before doing that, we removed several points from the HARPS RV time series in (Trifonov et al. 2020), with heavily outlying uncertainties of 10\u201324 m s\u22121, given the mean uncertainty \u03c3HARPS ' 1 m s\u22121. The problematic measurements appear around JD 2453169 (mid-June, 2004), when literally hundreds of spectra were taken overnight. Removing these points should not cause any problem, due to the dense sampling and binning. For the binned data in set D2, we adopted the uncertainties as the mean uncertainty in a particular bin.\nIn this way, the data set D2 consists of the whole pre-upgrade HARPS measurements DHARPS, as a homogeneous data set from Trifonov et al. (2020), and DCORALIE and DUCLES from Benedict et al. (2022). This set has 411 measurements and also spans 6317.5 days. To simplify presentation of the RV offsets, we subtracted the mean value of all RVs in a given subset from individual RVs in this subset.\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nFinally, in some experiments we considered data set D3 composed of 349 measurements from the pre-upgrade HARPS and DUCLES from Benedict et al. (2022). These RV time-series span the same time interval as D2 does. This data set D3 lacks the less accurate DCORALIE RVs."

            "text": "The mathematical models for the RV velocities are well known. However, to keep the presentation self-consistent, and to cover some nuances, we will briefly recall the required material.\nSince, following the prior literature, we expect that the \u00b5 Arae orbits may be quasi-circular, to get rid of weakly constrained longitudes of pericenter \u03d6i when eccentricities ei \u223c 0, we introduce Poincar\u00e9 elements {xi = ei cos\u03d6i,yi = ei sin\u03d6i}, i= 1,2,3,4. Also, the mean anomaly M at the initial epoch t0 denoted as Mi \u2261Mi(t0) is defined through the III law of Kepler, but written for the Jacobian reference frame\nPi = 2\u03c0\n\u221a a3i\nk2 (m0 +m1 + . . .mi) , Mi(t) = Mi+ 2\u03c0 Pi (t\u2212 t0) , (1)\nwhere k is the Gauss constant, and Pi, ai stand for the orbital period and semi-major-axis for each planet, respectively.\nRegarding the Keplerian parameterization of the RV, we apply the well known canonical formulae (Smart 1949) due to the presence of planets\nC(t) \u2261 V Kr (t) = Npl\n\u2211 i Ki [ei cos\u03c9i + cos(\u03bdi +\u03c9i)] , (2)\n= Npl\n\u2211 i Ki[xi +(x2i + y 2 i ) \u22121/2 (xi cos\u03bdi\u2212 yi sin\u03bdi)], (3)\nwhere \u03c9 \u2261 \u03d6 for a coplanar system, \u03bd \u2261 \u03bd(t) denotes the true anomaly of a planet, Npl is the number of planets in the system, and \u03bd = \u03bd(P,e,M (t)). To characterize the orbit of the i-th planet, we need to know five free orbital elements: \u03b8i = [Ki,Pi,xi \u2261 ei cos\u03d6i,yi \u2261 ei sin\u03d6i,Mi], where the RV semiamplitude Ki depends on the minimal mass of the planet mi sin I, when the inclination I = 90\u25e6.\nLet us note that we interpret the RV signal in terms of the geometric elements inferred in the Jacobian frame of reference. We follow here conclusions and discussion in Lee & Peale (2003), to properly express parameters of the Keplerian model through the Nbody initial condition. We need that to investigate the long-term stability of the system with the numerical integrations. For relatively massive planets, the Jacobian (canonical) elements account for indirect interactions between the planets on Keplerian orbits to the first order in the masses (the ratio of planet masses to the star mass), see also (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2012) for more details.\nIn order to derive the N-body initial condition from the fitted Keplerian elements \u03b8i, i = 1, . . . ,Npl, we first determine the minimal masses mi sin I \u2261mi and semi-major axes ai of the planets. The semi-amplitude Ki of the RV signal\nKi \u221a 1\u2212 e2i = ai (\n2\u03c0 Pi\n) mi\n(m0 +m1 + . . .+mi) ,\nwhere the ai constrained by the observationally derived orbital period Pi obeys Eq. 1, and m0 stands for the star mass. Eliminating ai, we obtain a cubic equation for the unknown masses, which may be subsequently solved for mi, i = 1,2, . . ., based on analytical formulae or with a simple Newton-Raphson scheme (a few iterations suffice to reach the machine accuracy). Then we transform the geometric elements to Cartesian coordinates and velocities with the standard two-body formulae, where the gravitational parameter for the ith planet is \u00b5i = k2(m0 +m1 + . . .mi).\nTo determine parameters of the orbital model explaining the RV time-series, we optimized a canonical form of the maximum likelihood function L (Baluev 2009):\nlnL =\u22121 2 \u2211i,t (O-C)2i,t \u03c32i,t \u2212 1 2 \u2211i,t ln\u03c32i,t \u2212 1 2 NRV ln2\u03c0, (4)\nwhere (O\u2212C)i,t is the (O-C) deviation of the observed t-th RV observation, with the uncertainty \u03c32i,t \u2192 \u03c32i,t +\u03c32f , with \u03c3 f parameter scaling the raw error \u03c3i,t in quadrature, and NRV is the total number of the RV observations. We assume that the uncertainties are Gaussian.\nThe error floor factors \u03c32f are different for each telescope, as they may involve not only the intrinsic, chromospheric RV stellar\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nvariability (stellar jitter), but also an instrumental uncertainties inherent to each telescope and the RV pipeline. The RV model also involves individual offsets of the zero-level RV for each instrument. Distinguishing between these two parameters is important even for the same spectrometer and different setups of its work. For instance, the upgrade of HARPS optical fibres around the middle of 2015 changed the instrumental profile and thus the RV offset between the pre- and post-upgrade RVs. To complicate things even more, the RV offset may be not the same for all stars and may even depend on the stellar spectral type (Trifonov et al. 2020).\nTherefore fitting the jitter uncertainties as free parameters of the model is crucial to obtain adequate statistical representation of the RV data. We may note here, that in the past, these parameters have been fixed based on the averaged values for chromospherically quiet stars of a given spectral type. That recently outdated (and somewhat incorrect) approach was used by Goz\u0301dziewski et al. (2007) and Pepe et al. (2007); Benedict et al. (2022) tuned the RV uncertainties to obtain \u03c72\u03bd ' 1.\nUsually, the Keplerian model determines sufficiently accurately the N-body, exact RVs. However, for systems with largemass planets, this equivalence may be questionable, especially if the interval of the RV time series becomes long. Then we have to introduce the self-consistent model that requires solving the Newtonian equations of motion. The RV due to the planets is the velocity component of the star along the z-axis w.r.t. the barycenter of the Solar system\nC(t)\u2261V Nr (t) =\u2212 1\nm0\nNpl \u2211 i=1 miz\u0307i(t), (5)\nwhich is parameterised through planet masses and the osculating orbital elements \u03b8i = [mi,ai,xi,yi,Mi] for each planet in the system. Here, as the osculating epoch we select the epoch of the first observation in the given time series. In some experiments, we also selected the osculating epoch in the middle of the data window.\nExpressions for the RVs, Eq. 2 and Eq. 5 have to be accompanied with the instrumental zero-level offset V0, j, j = 1, . . . ,M that makes it possible to compute (O\u2212C)(t) in Eq. 4. For Nplplanets forming a coplanar system observed with M instruments, we have therefore p = 5N+2M free parameters to be fitted to onedimensional time series of the RV observations.\nThe definition in Eq. 4 is constructed so the best-fitting models should yield \u03c72\u03bd = \u03c72/(NRV \u2212 p) \u223c 1, and \u03c72\u03bd cannot be used to compare the models quality. Instead, Baluev (2009) proposed to use:\nlnL =\u2212 lnL/NRV\u2212 ln(2e\u03c0)/2,\nwhere L is expressed in ms\u22121. This statistics is suitable to assess the relative quality of fits, since L\u223c \u3008\u03c3\u3009 measures a scatter of measurements around the best-fitting models, similar to the common RMS \u2014 smaller L means better fit.\nIn order to localize the best-fitting solutions in the multidimensional parameter space, we explore it with evolutionary algorithms (GEA from hereafter, Charbonneau 1995; Rucin\u0301ski et al. 2010). We then perform the MCMC analysis in the neighborhood of selected solutions using an affine invariant ensemble sampler (Goodman & Weare 2010) encompassed in a great emcee package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). The computations were performed in multi-CPU environment, making it possible to evaluate 128,000\u2013256,000 (or more) of 144\u2013384 emcee \u201cwalkers\u201d from a small-radius ball around a solution found with the GEA.\nWe select all priors as flat (or uniform, improper) by\nsufficiently broad ranges on the model parameters, e.g., Pi \u2208 [1,10,000] days, xi,yi \u2208 [\u22120.25,0.25], mi \u2208 [0.1,14] mJup, (i = 1,2,3,4), the error floors (jitters) \u03c3 f , j > 0 m s\u22121, j = 1, . . . ,M. In a few experiments with the N-body model, we also tested Gaussian priors for the (x1,y1) elements of the innermost planet, with the mean equal to zero and variances \u03c3x,y = 0.05,0.075,0.1, respectively. In this case, however, the results of sampling did not substantially change, compared to the flat priors."

            "text": "We first performed an extensive search for the best-fit solutions using GEA, and we collected ' 103 solutions for both data sets and model variants. We found that the best-fit Keplerian and Newtonian models with L ' 3.2 m s\u22121 (RMS ' 3.4 m s\u22121) have well determined extrema of lnL for orbital periods Pi of roughly 9.64,308,645,4030 days, respectively. Also, all osculating eccentricities are well limited to moderate values, roughly in the range of 0.02\u20130.1.\nThe resultig best-fitting parameters for data sets D1 and D2 are given in Tables 1 and 2. The best-fitting Keplerian model Fit IIK in Tab. 2 is illustrated in Fig. 2, left panel. Using this solution as an example, we checked the consistency of the Keplerian and Newtonian parameterization. We transformed Fit IIK as osculating elements for the epoch of the first observation t0 =JD 2450915.29 in the UCLES data, as described in Sect. 2.3. We then computed the Newtonian RV signal through of numerical integration of the Nbody equations of motion for the entire four-planet system with the IAS15 integrator (Rein & Spiegel 2015). It turns out that the difference \u2206RV(t) = V Nr (t)\u2212V Kr (t) increases in an oscillatory manner, reaching about \u00b110m s\u22121, which exceeds more than twice the RV signal from the innermost planet (red curve in the residuals diagram in Fig. 2).\nTo verify this effect globally in the parameter space, we performed the MCMC sampling with both the Keplerian and Newtonian RV models. The final results for data set D2 are illustrated in Fig. 3. (We skip presentation of the results for D1, since they are very similar). This figure shows one\u2013 and two\u2013dimensional projections of the posterior probability distribution for selected Keplerian (top row) and Newtonian (bottom row) orbital elements obtained for the innermost (left column) and outermost (right column) planet, respectively. The posterior has well defined extrema along all dimensions. We did not notice significant correlations between the displayed parameters, except for x,y and M .\nThe quality of the best-fit configurations, in terms of RMS ' 3.4 m s\u22121, is also almost the same. Surprisingly, the posterior distributions are not only very similar to each other, especially if we compare the two-dimensional shape distributions for x,y and M , but also the eccentricities and orbital angles closely overlap, e.g., the best-fit M4 anomaly differs by only 2o in these models.\nHow to interpret this apparent paradox, given the relatively large masses of Jupiter-like companions and their significant, mutual interactions over the observing interval, illustrated in Fig. 2? A direct comparison of the RV signals may be biased because the accuracy of the formal two-body Keplerian element transformation to Cartesian coordinates is limited to the first order in masses (e.g. Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2012). However, the representation of the Keplerian initial condition for the N-body problem may better fit the data if it is tuned within the parameter uncertainties. Therefore, given well bounded orbital elements, the MCMC sampling reveals globally similar posteriors for both models.\nWe also see the posteriors for the near 2e:1b MMR pair of a\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nSaturn-Jupiter-like planets exhibiting some significant differences (see on-line Supplementary Material, Fig. A1). This can be explained by their relatively shorter periods, covering ' 20 and ' 10 times the observational window, respectively, and the 2e:1b MMR proximity, which strengthens the mutual gravitational interactions.\nThe MCMC experiment implies that, keeping in mind the limitation for representing individual ICs, we can still use Keplerian MCMC sampling to efficiently explore the parameter space, in terms of the posterior distribution, especially for highly hierarchical configurations with large period ratio. Note that P4/P1 ' 400 for HD 160691. However, parameterization in terms of the N-body dynamics is obviously more accurate approach to explain the RV variability when considering individual (local) best-fit models.\nTo justify the above explanation, we compared the outcomes of the Keplerian and Newtonian fits for data set D2 in Table 2, and the results are illustrated in the O-C diagram in the right panel in Fig. 2. This time, the difference between the signals plotted as a red curve in the residuals diagram has much less variability, with the largest differences ' 5 m s\u22121 appearing for epochs without data.\nAs noted above, an important feature of the posterior distribu-\ntions is well bounded parameters for all planets. In particular, the semi-major axes of the middle pair, near 2e:1b-MMR (Rocinante\u2013 Quijote) are constrained to ' 0.0015\u20130.002 au, and for the outermost Sancho planet to just' 0.02 au , i.e., its orbital period may be determined with the uncertainty of one month (25\u201350 times better than with the data in 2006). That seems to be quite surprising, since the observational window covers only about 1.5 times the period of this companion. Similarly, the Poincar\u00e9 elements (xi = ei cos\u03d6i,yi = ei sin\u03d6i) of the Saturn- and Jovian planets may be determined to \u00b10.01, with uncertainties of the arguments of pericenter and the mean anomalies at the osculating epoch t0 on the level of \u00b115\u25e6. This translates to the mean longitude at the epoch \u03bbi that may be determined to' 4\u25e6. The eccentricities in the Keplerian and Newtonian parameterizations (Tables 1\u20132) are at the 0.05 level with small uncertainties, as we will show below, may be crucial for maintaining the long-term stability of the system.\nWe should also comment on similarities and difference between solutions derived for data sets D1 and D2 in this work, and with the Keplerian model in (Benedict et al. 2022).\nWe obtained very similar eccentricities of the planets, particu-\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nlarly the innermost eccentricity constrained to e1 ' 0.1. Given the old age of the star ' 6.7 Gyr and short orbital period ' 9.64 days of the warm Neptune, its eccentricity might be tidally circularized. We conducted direct numerical integrations of the system with all planets for a few Myr using the SABA4 integrator (Laskar & Robutel 2001) with the step size of 0.5 days, and we did not detect such a large eccentricity which could be forced by interactions with the outer planets. Actually, HD 160691d seems to be a common example in the known sample of warm Neptunes that exhibit nonzero eccentricity, typically around 0.15 (Correia et al. 2020). They found mechanisms opposing gravitational tides, such as thermal atmospheric tides, evaporation of the atmosphere, and the eccentricity excitation from a distant companion. The later seems to be not the cause of the moderate eccentricity of HD 160691d, but the presence of atmospheric tides may be sufficient to explain its moderate value.\nThe most significant difference between the solutions in (Benedict et al. 2022) and in this work is relatively shorter orbital period of HD 160691c, by ' 100 days (yet only ' 2%) in\n(Benedict et al. 2022). They report this solution as strongly unstable in 100 Kyr time scale, in contrast to our models, which appear safely stable in extended regions of the parameter space, for at least 6.7 Gyr, as discussed below.\nWe attempted to address outlying UCLES measurements, visible on the right end of the observation window (Fig. 2). There are systematic deviations from the synthetic model, reaching ' 10 m s\u22121, and unlikely they can be eliminated with the standard RV ephemeris. The HARPS and UCLES epochs overlap almost throughout the time window, but the HARPS measurements do not deviate as systematically as the UCLES data from the common model. This can be explained by a long-term instrumental UCLES effect. In order to account for it, we added a periodic drift to the RV model for the UCLES data RVdrift(t) = Acos(nt +\u03c60), where A, n and \u03c60 are the semi-amplitude, frequency and relative phase of the signal, respectively.\nAs the result of the MCMC sampling of the Keplerian model with this modification, we show (O-C) for the best-fit model in Fig. 4 and a section of the corner plot for the posterior with offsets,\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nerror floors, and drift parameters (on-line Supplementary Material, Fig. A2). Note that in this case we analyzed only the concurrent HARPS and UCLES RV series (data set D3). It turns out that the drift component can significantly reduce the UCLES outliers. The drift correction reduces the RMS value to 2.5 m s\u22121, which is almost 1 m s\u22121 less than the value for the unmodified model. However, the posterior distributions reveal that the drift\u2019s long period P = 2\u03c0/n' 36 yrs cannot be meaningfully constrained. Moreover, its half-amplitude A ' 12\u201315 m s\u22121 is weakly limited on the right end, and strongly correlated with the RV offset V0,2 \u2261V0,UCLES, as it is labeled in the corner plot for the UCLES data. At the same time, the orbital parameters have not changed except for the period of P4 ' (3944\u00b1 27) days, significantly shorter than P4 ' 4020\u2013 4060 days in our models without drift, but similar to P4' 3947 days in the solution of Benedict et al. (2022).\nGiven some variability in the residuals to the Keplerian and Newtonian models in Fig. 2, we analyzed them with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, in the period window from 2 days to 64,000 days. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Indeed, the (O-C) in the left panel for the 4-planet model to the data set D2 shows some signature of the long-term drift. However, we did not detect any significant peak at the 1% false alarm probability estimated by the bootstrap method at a level of ' 0.07. We performed the same test on the residuals to the 4-planet model with the sinusoidal drift. It is clear that the long-term drift period has disappeared, and there are still no significant peaks in the high frequency range. The (O-C) analysis suggests that we could not detect any significant RV signal that can be attributed to a new planet in the system.\nThese results are consistent with the conclusions in the work of Benedict et al. (2022). They did not detect any correlation of the RV variability attributed to the planets with the periodicity of the spectral line profile distortion indicators. They found peaks of the\nbisector with low significance, around 357\u2013368 days and 497 days, which can be explained by stellar activity.\nSince the inclusion of RV drift appears problematic due to the strong V0,2\u2013A correlation, and the drift-modified model does not actually qualitatively change the orbital architecture and stability of the system (as justified below), other than shortening the outermost orbital period by ' 2%, we have abandoned this model. However, the likely instrumental nature and origin of the UCLES RV-outliers remains unexplained."

We conducted it with two fast dynamical indicators, the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO, \u3008Y \u3009Cincotta et al. 2003) and the Reversibility Error Method (Panichi et al. 2017, REM). These numerical tools are CPU-efficient variants of the Maximal Lyapunov Exponent (MLE) that make it possible to detect unstable solutions and visualize the structure of the phase space.\nThe usefulness of the MEGNO method in analyzing the dynamics of planetary systems with strongly interacting companions has been proven for a long time (e.g., Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2012, and references therein). We have also shown in (Panichi et al. 2017) that the REM indicator is not only equivalent to MEGNO, but may be also much more CPU-efficient. Briefly recalling the idea of this algorithm, computing REM relies in comparing the difference between the Cartesian initial condition x0 after integrating it numerically forward and back, for the same number n of time steps \u2206t, using a time-reversible numerical scheme, to obtain the final state x(\u00b1n\u2206t).

(6)\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nThis difference grows exponentially with integration time for chaotic systems, and at a polynomial rate for regular (stable) configurations. Such a simple algorithm can be implemented with a symplectic discretization scheme. In practice, for systems with small and moderate eccentricities, which \u00b5 Arae systems appear to be, we use the classic leap-frog algorithm (e.g. Laskar & Robutel 2001) with symplectic correctors of the order 5 (Wisdom 2006),\noffering numerical accuracy and efficiency comparable to higher order methods (Wisdom 2018), see also (Panichi et al. 2017) for details. As we have shown, in the later paper, this REM algorithm is particularly useful in regions of phase space with predominantly stable solutions and outperforms then any MEGNO variant in terms of CPU-efficiency.\nIn this work, to speed up computations, we conducted the nu-\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nmerical simulations using our \u00b5FARM code parallelized with the Message Passing Interface (MPI).

Figure 6 illustrates the (a3,e3)\u2013plane. In these scans, all other orbital elements are kept at their best-fit values listed in Table 1. To make possible reproduce the results, we quote exact numerical values of the elements and masses. For each initial condition in the grid, the equations of motion were integrated up to 200 Kyr, corresponding to' 1.8\u00d7104P4. This time interval allows for the detection of short-term chaotic motions for the time scale of the MMRs instability (e.g. Goz\u0301dziewski & Migaszewski 2018).\nSome of the dynamical maps were computed for 3-planet systems with the most massive planets, omitting the innermost warm Neptune. Its very short orbital period of 9.64 days compared to that one of the outermost planet (' 4000 days) causes a huge CPU overhead. Before that, we investigated whether the presence of Dulcinea could affect the orbital evolution of the other massive companions and such 3-planet maps. To this end, we numerically integrated the systems described by Fit IN, with and without the warm Neptune, for several Myr, when secular effects may already play a role. Fig. 5 illustrates the resulting osculating semi-major and eccentricity over a narrow time interval around 2.8 Myr for Quijote (HD 160691b). Clearly, the elements span the same ranges and evolve along curves with very similar shapes. Their de-phasing is due to a small change of the mean motion and other elements. The most significant shift can be seen for Sancho (HD 160691c, not shown here), yet its semimajor axes is shifted by ' 0.002 au, roughly 10 times less than 1\u03c3 uncertainty for this orbital element.\nTo study whether the innermost planet can be omitted from the system for long-term integrations, Farago et al. (2009) averaged the model for the fast orbiting innermost planet. Obviously, such an analytical model is numerically as CPU efficient, as the 3- planet model. Moreover, they found for the particular \u00b5 Arae case the results from three formulations of the orbital evolution: the exact one, the 3-planet model with omitted warm Neptune, and the 3-planet model with its mass added to the mass of the star lead to barely distinct results.\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nTo test this independently, and without any simplifications of the equations of motion, we used the REM indicator directly and compared dynamical maps for the 3- and 4-planet configurations, respectively, for the same ranges of orbital parameters.\nWe start with the upper-left panel in Fig. 6 for a relatively broad region of the ICs marked with a star symbol. That map was computed without the innermost Neptune, using the leapfrog scheme and a time step of 8 days. A wide structure around a3 ' 1.47 au on the left of this IC corresponds to the 2b:1c MMR of the inner pair of Saturn-Jupiter\u2013mass planets. Given the small 1\u03c3 uncertainty 0.001 au of the nominal semi-major axis, the separation of the best-fitting configuration from this MMR is meaningful (the error bars are smaller than the symbol radius). Simultaneously, the ICs is located between three narrow strips of unstable solutions that may be identified with higher-order resonances. Close-up maps in the remaining panels of Fig. 6 reveal a very close proximity of the ICs to one of these strips.\nPanels in the bottom row are for the same (a3,e3)-plane, but scanned with \u3008Y \u3009 for the 3-planet model (bottom-left panel) and with REM calculated for the full 4-planet configuration (bottomright panel), but with a much smaller step size of 0.33 days and lower resolution compared to the 3-planet REM-map computed with the leap-frog step-size 8 days (upper-right panel). Of course, this is forced by the short orbital period of HD 160691d. The maps\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nclearly illustrate the one to one results, in a region with weakly unstable configurations and different, very fine dynamical structures. We may note that the ICs is negligibly shifted by ' 10\u22125 au with respect to the unstable structure, between the 3-planet and 4-planet scans.\nWhile the REM map for three planets was calculated several times faster than the \u3008Y \u3009 map, the full REM calculation for four planets was more than 15 times slower per pixel. Such overhead is acceptable, however, given that the calculations were performed without any simplification of the Newtonian equations of motion.\nThe detection of fine unstable structures and tiny islands of stable resonances confirms once again a good sensitivity of the REM algorithm for stable and unstable solutions. To show this better, we interpreted the unstable strip structure through the numerical analysis of the fundamental frequencies (NAFF, Laskar & Robutel 2001) of a particular system marked with a white diamond symbol in a small stable island around (a3,e3)' (1.5211au,0.01). This island is a part of the three-body MMR 2e:-4b:1c structure (one of the strips spanning e3 \u2208 [0,0.1]). We plotted evolution of a selected critical angle of this resonance \u03b82:\u22124:\u22121 = 2\u03bb2\u2212 4\u03bb3\u2212\u03bb4 +\u03d62 + \u03d63 +\u03d64 in Fig. 7. This critical angle librates with large amplitude around 180\u25e6, and the orbital configuration is perfectly stable for at least 1 Gyr, consistently with its location in the stable island.\nIn contrast, we selected formally unstable ICs by shifting the nominal semi-major axis to the right (to the unstable strip) and marked with a black triangle symbol in Fig. 6. We integrated this ICs for 6.7 Gyr with the SABA4 scheme and for 1 Gyr with the variable step-size IAS15 integrator. Also in this case the system does not reveal any signature of geometric instability, in spite of its formally chaotic character in the sense of MLE (it is not illustrated here, but we invoke a similar example in Sect. 3.2.2). The width of this third-order MMR is very small, \u2206a3 ' 0.003 au, and the diffusion is likely so slow that it does not lead to a change or disruption of the system.\nWe remark here that Benedict et al. (2022) found quite an opposite, catastrophic instability of the system. In their Keplerian solution, P4 ' (3947\u00b1 23) days is apparently the only significant difference with our fits (Table 1). The origin of this discrepancy may be a subtly different parameterization of the RV signal. For instance, Benedict et al. (2022) did not fit the jitter uncertainties as free parameters, but tuned it posteriori for each data set to obtain \u03c72\u03bd ' 1. Moreover, our models yield smaller RMS ' 3.4m s\u22121 rather than ' 3.8m s\u22121 in the prior work. A shorter period of P4 ' 3947 days may be pointing to an unstable structure close to a4 ' 5.12 au (similar to that one visible in the top-left panel in Fig. 10). We integrated the system with the outermost planet Sancho placed in this unstable zone, but the system survived for at least 1 Gyr. We could not reproduce the strong instability reported in (Benedict et al. 2022), and we cannot find any convincing explanation of this discrepancy."

In the two later papers, they found the bestfitting model close to the separatrix, unstable zone of this resonance. Contour levels of \u03c72\u03bd encompass both the near-resonance and the resonant configuration (Pepe et al. 2007, their Fig. 7). In (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2007), we also found that the relative position of the ICs and the shape of the 2e:1b resonance in the (a3,e3)-plane strongly depend on the semi-major axis of HD 160691c that could be only weakly constrained to \u00b11300 days (4 au\u20137 au) and eccentricity e4 as large as 0.2 at the time.\nWe can now revisit this issue with a significantly updated Fit IIN. To do so, we calculated the dynamical maps illustrated in Fig. 8 for the 3-planet (upper panel) and 4-planet (middle panel) configurations, respectively. For the 3-planet model, we added the mass of innermost Neptune to that of the star. It can be clearly seen that the two maps coincide in each detail, and any shift in the position of the ICs relative to the fine structures is barely noticeable.\nThe coordinates of the dynamical maps were chosen to match the NAFF maps in (Pepe et al. 2007, their Fig. 7) and in (Farago et al. 2009, their Fig. 3). Since a direct comparison of the maps is not possible, due to changes in elements in the ICs, we have marked with a diamond a qualitative position of the former initial state relative to the approximate shape of MMR 2e:1b and its separatrix zone. Clearly, the Fit IIN is separated from the separatix region by ' 5\u03c3. This statistically proves that the nominal system is not resonant and is in a safely stable zone. The narrow stripes of unstable motions can be identified with weak, higher-order 3-body MMRs with very long diffusion time scales, similar to the 2e:-4b:-1c MMR analyzed above.\nThese conclusions can be reinforced with a REM map for the three outer planets in the semi-major axes space, represented in the orbital period ratios (P3/P2,P4/P3)-plane, as the astrocentric Keplerian representation of the semi-major axes, see the bottom panel of Fig. 8. Here, we marked 1\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 uncertainties the same as in the previous panels. We computed them based on the MCMC samples. In this map, the 2-body MMRs are marked with vertical (some of them labelled) and horizontal curves. Skewed curves and lines are for 3-body MMRs and could be identified with a method described in (Guzzo 2005). Also this REM map reveals the Fit IIN safely separated from the 2e:1b MMR by several \u03c3."

There should be also strong, almost linear correlations between the masses and massinclination correlation due to the msin I degeneracy.\nHowever, this intuition seems insufficient in light of the MCMC sampling results for data set D2, illustrated in Fig. 9 (upper plot). It shows posterior histograms for all masses m1,2,3,4 and for the inclination I as a free parameter. In addition to the predicted strong mass-inclination correlation, we found a clear, well-defined posterior maximum for I ' 30\u25e6. We tested this effect in multiple MCMC sampling experiments, varying the initial solution and sampling conditions.\nSince, due to parameter correlations, the estimated auto-\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\ncorrelation time is as many as 25,000 iterations, we sampled up to 400,000 steps for each of 144 walkers, corresponding to 15\u221220 auto-correlation times. As a starting point for the sampling, we took Fit IIN in Table 2 supplemented with I = 20\u25e6,45\u25e6,60\u25e6 and 75\u25e6, respectively. Interestingly, in all cases, regardless of the initial I, the extremum is robust and occurs around I ' (30\u25e6\u00b110\u25e6). At the same time, we monitored the RMS > 3.4 m s\u22121 for best-fitting solutions, which rises significantly to RMS ' 3.6\u20133.8 m s\u22121 below I > 30\u25e6. This means that the RV data predicts all planetary masses safely below the brown dwarf limit, i.e., the physical masses can be at most 2\u20133 times the minimum masses.\nTo assess the statistical significance of this result, we computed the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) defined as (e.g. Claeskens & Hjort 2008)\nBIC = p lnNRV\u22122lnLmax,\nfor the Newtonian model, for the edge-on system with I = 90\u25e6 and for a model with variable I, with p = 26 and p = 27 of free parameters, respectively; NRV = 411, and lnLmax is the value of lnL evaluated at the posterior extremum. For the two models, we found lnLmax(\u03b8, I = 90\u25e6) =\u2212987.07 and lnLmax(\u03b8, I) =\u2212987.7, respectively, hence BIC(\u03b8, I = 90\u25e6) = 2130.62, and BIC(\u03b8, I) = 2137.96,\nrespectively. Therefore\n\u2206BIC = BIC(\u03b8, I = 90\u25e6)\u2212BIC(\u03b8, I)'\u22127 < 2,\nindicating that there is no evidence of the model with free inclination against the edge-on model with a smaller value of BIC, see (Claeskens & Hjort 2008). However, if we apply the secondorder Akaike information criterion (AIC) for small sample sizes (NRV/p' 15 < 40),\nAIC = 2p+2(p+1)/(NRV\u2212 p\u22121)\u22122lnLmax,\nthen \u2206AIC < 2 for the two concurrent fit models, and that the candidate model is indicated almost as good as the best edge-on model (Claeskens & Hjort 2008). We consider this as a marginal indication of the significance of the inclined model, which needs to be addressed with longer RV time series.\nFurthermore, we examined this effect for the D3 data set, consisting of only the most accurate HARPS and UCLES RVs, and also changed the osculating epoch of the Newtonian model to the middle of the RV time series. In this experiment, we also increased the number of iterations to 500,000 steps for each of the 144 walkers. As a starting ICs, we chose Fit IIN from Tab. 2 with an initial value of I = 45\u25e6, but without any prior tuning of this solution. The results are shown in Fig. 9, lower plot. In this case, the posterior\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\ndistribution is shifted toward I = 20\u25e6. This may further indicate a systematic but weak dependence of the Newtonian model on the inclination, which is also sensitive to the RVs changes.\nThe stability zone and fine unstable structures for inclined coplanar systems are illustrated in dynamical maps in the (a4,e4)plane (Fig. 10) constructed for different inclinations of the coplanar system. We selected the best-fitting solutions from the MCMC samples with lowest RMS ' 3.35 m s\u22121 detected, and close to particular, a\u2019priori fixed inclinations. Subsequent panels are for such best-fitting models with the inclination equal to I = 90\u25e6 (the nominal Fit IIN in Tab. 2), I = 60\u25e6, I = 45\u25e6, and I = 33\u25e6, respectively. In the later case, the planet masses are twice as large as in the nominal, edge-on system. Moreover, the orbital elements selected from the MCMC samples are slightly different, thus introducing variability consistent with parameter uncertainties to the elements behind the map coordinates.\nTo effectively illustrate the region of stability with respect to I in a more global way, we scaled the minimal masses in Fit IIN according to the minimum mass rule mi sin I = const, recalling the mass-inclination correlation. We then calculated the dynamical maps in the (I,e2) plane (Fig. 11). For reference, the second upper x axis in these maps is for the mass of HD 160691e scaled with I.\nAlthough, as we have shown, the influence of the warm Neptune is negligible for the dynamical evolution of the outer planets when their masses are minimal, this may not be the case for small inclinations. We therefore calculated two versions of the REM maps, for three- (top panel) and four-planets (middle panel), respectively (the later with lower resolution to save CPU time). It can be clearly seen that in the range of I \u2208 [5\u25e6,90\u25e6], which covers the variation of masses spanning one order of magnitude, all, even very fine features of the phase space remain the same.\nFinally, we constructed a REM map in the orbital period ratios plane shown in Fig. 11 (bottom panel) around I = 20\u25e6, similar to the scan in Fig. 8. In this case, the masses of the planets are (1.34,4.91,5.85)mJup, i.e., the minimum masses scaled by a factor 3. We integrated each point for 300 kyr forward and back with the leap-frog scheme and the step size of 8 days. The ICs is located in a denser network of 2-body and 3-body MMRs, but still well separated from the 2e:1b MMR. We can also observe the high sensitivity of REM to interacting MMRs, indicated by in their regions of overlap (crossings).\nSince the ICs is very close to an unstable 3-body MMR, we\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nperformed a comparative integration of the nominal system and a configuration slightly shifted so that it is located in this nearby unstable MMR region (yellow strip in the lower panel of Fig. 11). We used the SABA4 scheme and the step size of 16 days, keeping the energy integral to 10\u221210 on the relative scale. In both cases, the system survived integrations for the lifetime of the star (6.7 Gyr). Such narrow chaotic 3-body MMRs, similar to that one analysed in Fig. 4 do not appear \u201cdangerous\u201d for the long-term stability. The chaotic configuration reveals only weak diffusion of a4 and e4. This is illustrated in Fig. 12.\nThe general conclusion of this experiment is a relatively wide stable zone preserved despite the enlarged minimal masses of the planets 2-3 times. The limit of stable solutions for I = 15\u25e6\u201320\u25e6 roughly coincides with the shape of statistically detected posterior extremum for I = 30\u25e6 (data set D2) and I = 20\u25e6 for data set D3, as we found with the MCMC sampling. Systems with the most probable inclinations I = 60\u25e6 in purely random sample would be in the middle of a broad, stable zone. Such the likely inclination increases the planet masses by only 15%.\nMoreover, the clear posterior maxima for I ' 30\u25e6 and I ' 20\u25e6 found here (still, in the stable zone) may confirm the marginally detected bias toward small inclinations of multiple systems, investigated with the HST astrometry in (Benedict et al. 2022). We should also note that for \u00b5 Arae very small inclinations I . 10\u25e6 can apparently be ruled out on both statistical as well as on dynamical grounds."

            "text": "Based on the updated, rigorously stable and well constrained orbital solutions collected in Table 2, we simulated the dynamical structure of hypothetical debris disks in the system. In the large \u201cgap\u201d between the two outer planets, at' 1.52 au and 5.2 au, respectively, we can predict orbitally stable objects with masses that are below the present detection levels. This region may be an analogue of the Main Belt in the Solar System, given the striking similarity of the orbits of the Saturn- and Jupiter-mass planets to those of Mars and Jupiter. The second debris disk, located beyond the orbit of the outermost Jovian planet (Sancho), may be similar to the Kuiper Belt. There is also free space between the two innermost planets that may contain Earth-mass objects, in the wide free space extending for ' 0.9 au between the orbits.\nWe could try to recover the structure of the phase space using fast indicators, in the form of the dynamic maps shown earlier in Fig. 6 and 10 for the planets. However, such maps constructed for fixed orbital phases of test particles permitted to vary freely may reveal an incomplete picture. The stability of a free test body in a system depends not only on its semi-major axis and eccentricity (a0,e0), but also on its relative orbital phase with respect to massive planetary perturbers.\nTo circumvent this limitation, we introduced a concept of the so-called \u3008Y \u3009-model (or \u3008Y \u3009-disk) (Goz\u0301dziewski & Migaszewski 2018). We assume that the massive planets form a system of primaries in safely stable orbits robust to small perturbations. Then we inject bodies with masses significantly smaller than masses of the primaries on orbits with different semi-major axes and eccentricities spanning the interesting region, and the orbital phases selected randomly. Next, we integrate numerically the individual synthetic configurations and determine their stability with the MEGNO aka \u3008Y \u3009 fast indicator. For this experiment MEGNO is preferable over REM since we may expect that most of the orbits are unstable.\nAs soon as MEGNO reaches a value \u3008Y \u3009 ' 5, sufficiently different for \u3008Y \u3009 ' 2 for stable solutions, we can stop the integration, thus saving CPU-time. We explain in detail the method and calibration experiments spanning orbital evolution of debris disks in the massive four-planet HR 8799 system for up to 70 Myr in (Goz\u0301dziewski & Migaszewski 2018). A comparison of the results of direct numerical integrations with the outcomes of the \u3008Y \u3009-model confirms that these two approaches are consistent one with the other. Yet the \u3008Y \u3009-disk method is CPU-efficient and therefore makes it possible to obtain a clear, quasi-global representation of the structure of stable solutions. This algorithm is especially effective for strongly interacting systems.\nTo conduct the \u3008Y \u3009 simulations, we chose Fit IIN located in a wide zone of stable motions. Such a \u201csafe\u201d neighborhood is important for the \u3008Y \u3009-model, since the system is not prone to small perturbations exerted by the probe objects \u2013 we integrate numerically the orbits of all bodies. Again, since we focus on the space beyond the orbit of HD 160691e, a0 ' 0.9 au, we omitted the innermost planet influence for the Main Belt and Kuiper Belt disks, to improve the CPU performance. However, the effect of the innermost planet was included in the simulation of the dynamical map for the inner zone between the warm Neptune and the Saturn-like planet (upper left panel in Fig. 13).\nWe considered three types of probe objects in different mass regime: Vesta-like asteroids with a mass of 3\u00d710\u22127 mJup, massive Earth-like planets with a mass of 10\u22122 mJup, and super-Earths with a mass of 3\u00d710\u22122 mJup (equivalent to' 10 Earth masses, in a subNeptune mass range). The RV amplitude of the later objects would be on the level of 2\u22123 m s\u22121, relatively easily detectable with the present RV measurements accuracy. Also, in that case we set the system inclination I = 60\u25e6 to enhance the mutual gravitational influence between the planets and the test objects. In all experiments, the probe object interacts gravitationally with the three most massive planets.\nTo calculate the \u3008Y \u3009 values for the synthetic systems, we integrated the N-body equations of motion and their variational equations with the GBS integrator (Hairer et al. 1993; Hairer & Wanner 1995) for ' 105 yrs. Such an interval covers ' 104 orbital periods of outermost planet, which makes it possible to detect unstable motions associated with strongest two-body and three-body MMRs. This integration time is also consistent with the the typical characteristic time-scale required to achieve \u3008Y \u3009 convergence for a stable configuration. The GBS integrator is the best choice in the case of collisional dynamics that is frequently expected in this setup."

As the mass of the probing objects increases, the regions may decrease in size, both in the coordinate\u2013 and orbital element\u2013 planes. This is illustrated in Fig. 14 for Earth-mass objects (the left column) and super-Earths (the right column), respectively. That case we should interpret in terms of a potential location of the small planets rather than a representation of a physical debris disk.\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nThe distribution of Earth objects is very similar to the experiment for Vesta-type asteroids, as could be predicted from the similarity of this system to the restricted problem (with zero-mass asteroids). For more massive super-Earth \u201casteroids\u201d and the inclinations of the system I = 60\u25e6 the stable zones shrink considerably, but the overall disks structure is still preserved. We can conclude that the \u3008Y \u3009-model scales for several orders of magnitude of the probe masses.\nThe results are therefore universal in the sense that we can predict the locations of e.g., Earth-like planets that are below the current detection limits. It turns out that such small planets could be found in the habitable zone, despite Rocinante and Quijote prevent stable orbits of terrestrial planets unless they are placed beyond roughly 2 au (see Fig. 14), or interior to 0.3\u20130.4 au.\nGiven the luminosity of \u00b5 Arae L = 1.9L and the spectral temperature T = 5820 K (Soriano & Vauclair 2010), the outer limiting distance roughly correspond to the orbit of Mars in the Solar system. Indeed, for an Earth-like planet, the inner radius of the runaway greenhouse effect is rmin = 1.31 au, the radius of maximum greenhouse effect rmax = 2.30 au, and the radius for early Mars zone rEM = 2.42 au (Kopparapu et al. 2014, their habitable zone calculator). Therefore, habitable Earth-like planets could be\nfound in a small region of Lagrangian (Trojan) 1:1b orbits around HD 160691b as well on the inner edge of the Main Belt, up to the 3:1c MMR gap (see the elements distribution in Fig. 14)."

            "text": "The HD 160691 planetary system is one of the first detected multiplanet configurations with a mass-diverse planets, and it comprises of a warm Neptune, a Saturn-mass planet, and two massive Jupitermass objects. The precision RV data available in public archives, spanning at least 1.5 outermost periods, makes it already possible to tightly constrain the orbits and minimal masses of the planetary companions to 1\u03c3 ' 0.02mJup. Unfortunately, given a low accuracy of the HST astrometry reported in (Benedict et al. 2022), and insufficient detection limits (estimated here independently), we restricted the analysis to the RV data only.\nWe improved kinematic (Keplerian) models reported more than 15 years ago (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2007; Pepe et al. 2007), as well as in the very recent paper by Benedict et al. (2022). Our Newtonian RV models of the HD 160691 system imply its long-term stable, Solar system-like orbital architecture. The planets revolve\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320\nin low-eccentricity orbits determined with significantly reduced uncertainties ' 0.01 w.r.t. the prior literature, closely resembling the Earth\u2013Mars\u2013Jupiter sequence. Other orbital elements, and particularly the semi-major axes are bounded 0.02 au for the outermost planet, and to just 0.001\u20130.002 au for remaining inner massive companions. Limiting uncertainty of the outermost semi-major axis to' 27 days means a qualitative improvement, compared to uncertainties of 700\u20131300 days reported in (Goz\u0301dziewski et al. 2007) and (Pepe et al. 2007).\nUsing the dynamical maps technique, we found that the nominal ICs cover regions in the phase space within several \u03c3 error bars that correspond to long-term stable evolution. The direct numerical integrations indicate stable orbital evolution of the best-fitting models for at least 6.7 Gyr (i.e., the lifetime of the star).\nThe present RV data do not make it possible to fully constrain the system inclination. However, it does not influence the stability in a wide range between 90\u25e6 and ' 20\u25e6. In this range, coplanar systems remain in similarly wide and safe zones of stable motions, despite of planet masses enlarged a few times, in accord with the msin I relation. Moreover, we found a close overlap of the dynamical stability with the best-fitting models in the sense that there is clear maximum of the posterior distribution for lnL and a steep increase of the RMS at I ' 20\u25e6\u201330\u25e6. This means that all the masses would remain certainly below the brown dwarf mass range. It also proves that the analysed RV data bring information on the mutual interactions between the system components.\nThe meaningfully constrained orbits make it possible to globally investigate the global dynamical structure of the system. The inner pair of Saturn-Jupiter\u2013mass planets is close to the 2e:1b MMR, but is significantly and systematically separated from this resonance. Similarly, the outer pair is close to the 6b:1c MMR but also is meaningfully far from it. This result may be important since it adds a new observational evidence on a near-resonant, well characterised multiple system with Jovian-mass planets.\nMultiple planetary systems, especially in the lower mass range detected by the Kepler mission, exhibit excess of planets close to first-order MMR (2:1 and 3:2), with the period ratio slightly higher than the resonant value (e.g. Petrovich et al. 2013; Ramos et al. 2017; Delisle & Laskar 2014; Marzari 2018, and references therein). There is a debate in the literature about the origin of this effect. It has recently been shown (Marzari 2018) that the presence of a massive circumbinary disk can significantly affect the resonant behavior of a pair of planets, shifting the resonant position and reducing the size of the stability region. Dissipation of the disk may explain some exosystems that are close to the MMR but not trapped within it. If such mechanism was active in the \u00b5 Arae system, the current, near 2e:1b MMR for the inner pair could be a signature of a massive circumstellar disk in the past and its remnants in the form of asteroid belts at present. In this context, the evolution of the \u00b5 Arae system serves a particularly interesting scenario. The nearresonant pair is accompanied by a more distant high-mass companion, also near higher-order 6c:1b MMR of the outer pair, which certainly enriches the dynamical setup.\nThe orbital architecture permits for the presence of massive debris disks, indeed, as they might survive between the planets. There is especially wide region between the outer pair, spanning the semi-major axes range of (1.5,5.2) au; also there is such a vastly wide stable region beyond the outermost planet, starting at' 6.5 au and huge Trojan islands coorbital with the outermost planet. Simulations of these debris disks reveal their strongly resonant structure that is preserved in a wide range of probe masses, between Vestalike asteroids and super-Earths with ' 10 Earth masses. Te debris\ndisks would be (obviously) strongly influenced by the MMRs with the Jovian planets. Their short-term MMR structure closely resembles the Main Belt and the Kuiper Belt in the Solar system.\nProspects to detect relatively massive, super-Earth\u2013mass objects in the zone around 0.3 au\u20130.5 au or in other parts of the system, where stable orbits of are possible, are uncertain but unlikely. The semi-amplitude of their RV signals would be comparable with the intrinsic stellar jitter variability. We did not detect significant periods in the residuals of the RV models other than those identified with the known planets.\nBecause \u00b5 Arae has a fairly large parallax (' 65 mas), it may be an interesting and promising target for ALMA and other instruments to detect dust emissions, and set additional limits on the presence of small planets in outer parts of the system. In addition, the detection of debris disks, especially the outer one, can help better constrain the inclination of the system.\nMonitoring the RV variability of the star still seems plausible, as it may permit to characterise the system even better, once the Gaia DR4 catalogue is released. Our simulation of the IAD measurements with the help of htof package (Brandt et al. 2021) reveal that the two outer planets will be astrometrically detectable with very high S/N, provided the uncertainty of the IAD time series on the level of 0.1 mas. Moreover, we have shown that the mutual gravitational interactions can be detected in the RV data up to the middle of 2015. Additional precision RV observations might greatly help to break or reduce the msin I degeneracy, and confirm or rule out the inclination of the system I ' 20\u25e6\u201330\u25e6 indicated by our Bayesian MCMC sampling experiments.\nFinally, the highly hierarchical configuration of \u00b5 Arae is a new test-bed for our new fast indicator REM (Panichi et al. 2017) that helps to analyse the structure of the phase space in terms of the most accurate, Newtonian representation of the data. Despite analytical approximations for the motion of the innermost planet may be constructed (Farago et al. 2009), the simple REM algorithm based on the canonical leap-frog scheme offers a sufficient numerical efficiency to derive the dynamical maps through integrating the exact equations of motion of the whole system. It is also fully compatible with more CPU demanding MEGNO technique, especially for systems in regions of the the phase space which are filled with mostly stable solutions."

Offsets V0,1, V0,2 and jitters \u03c31 and \u03c32 for HARPS and UCLES, respectively, as well as the semi-amplitude A of the drift signal are expressed in m s\u22121. The n parameter is the drift frequency converted to and expressed in years, and the phase shift of the drift \u03c60 is expressed in degrees.\n\u00a9 2022 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201320"
