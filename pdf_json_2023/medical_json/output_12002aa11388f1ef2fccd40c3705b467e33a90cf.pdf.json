In general, in-graft stenosis after arterial replacement tends to occur at the anastomotic site due to intimal thickening. In this article, we report a rare case of stenosis at the non-anastomotic site in the late stage after carotid artery replacement, which was successfully treated with carotid artery stenting (CAS).\nCase Description: A\u00a0woman in her 20s experienced injury to the right carotid artery during an operation for removal of a carotid body tumor 6\u00a0 years before presentation. e right common carotid artery and internal carotid artery were replaced with an artificial vessel graft at that time. Intraluminal stenosis in the graft was not identified 3\u00a0years after surgery; however, 4\u00a0years after surgery, stenosis was recognized at the non-anastomotic site inside the artificial vessel graft. Subsequently, antiplatelet therapy was initiated. e stenosis was noted to progress gradually in follow-up appointments. erefore, we decided to intervene because of the patient\u2019s young age and the risk of long-term hemodynamic stress. Angiography revealed pseudo-occlusion in the artificial vessel. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed for stenosis with distal protection; subsequently, CAS was performed. e patient was discharged without neurological deficits 4\u00a0days after the operation, and no apparent restenosis was observed as of the 1-year follow-up.\nConclusion: Stenosis after cervical artery replacement can be safely treated with CAS. Inflation pressure and stent should be selected according to the pathology of the stenosis.\nKeywords: Artificial blood vessel, Carotid artery stenosis, Carotid artery stenting, Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)\nSurgical Neurology International \u2022 2023 \u2022 14(8) | 2"

During the operation, the right carotid artery was injured and the right common carotid artery and internal carotid artery were replaced with an artificial vessel comprised of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE, outer diameter of 4\u00a0 mm). e patient was discharged without any neurological deficits. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed no obvious stenosis 2\u00a0 years after the surgery [Figure\u00a0 1a]. Furthermore, cervical computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed no obvious stenosis 3\u00a0years after surgery [Figure\u00a01b].\nFour years after the surgery, MRA showed suspicious stenosis in the artificial vessel [Figure\u00a01c], and antiplatelet medication (aspirin 100\u00a0mg) was administered. Carotid ultrasonography showed intimal thickening with isointense fibrous tissue in the vessel, and the peak systolic velocity (PSV) was 242\u00a0cm/s [Figure\u00a0 2a] in the most stenotic portion. e patient was referred to our hospital in the same year. e PSV of the stenosis 2\u00a0years after the previous examination was increased to 255\u00a0 cm/s on ultrasonography [Figure\u00a0 2b], and stenosis had clearly progressed. On MRA, the right carotid artery appeared almost occluded [Figure\u00a03a]. CTA showed that the stenosis was slightly distal to the anastomosis of the artificial vessel [Figure\u00a03b]. e patient had no neurological symptoms. A\u00a0cerebral blood flow (CBF) study on SPECT with Diamox stress showed no obvious hemodynamic compromise.\nAlthough the patient was asymptomatic and CBF was maintained, we decided to perform endovascular revascularization with her informed consent because of the risk of long-term hemodynamic stress and the possibility of adhesion after the previous surgery. We planned percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with a non-compliant balloon to fully dilate the stenosis and then deployed an open-cell stent to prevent restenosis. e common carotid artery was difficult to detect on the cervical MRA [Figure\u00a0 3c]; however, CTA revealed severe stenosis [Figure\u00a03d] immediately before the treatment."

Heparin was administered at a dose of 5000 units and added to maintain an ACT \u2265250. An 8Fr OPTIMO (Tokai Medical Products, Aichi) guiding catheter with a balloon was navigated to the right common carotid artery. Common carotid angiography showed pseudo-occlusion of the stenosis [Figures\u00a0 4a and b]. e diameter of the common carotid artery proximal to the stenosis was approximately 4.8\u00a0 mm. Under proximal flow control with a balloon, the stenosis was easily passed with a carotid Guardwire (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA, USA), then we expanded the distal protection balloon. Due to an unsatisfactory expansion, we performed pre-dilation twice with Rx-Genity 3.5\u00a0 mm \u00d7 40\u00a0 mm (Kaneka Medics,\nSurgical Neurology International \u2022 2023 \u2022 14(8) | 3\nOsaka, Japan) at 8 and 14 atm for 60 s, respectively. en, we advanced an aspiration catheter and aspirated a large, dark-red thrombus. After aspiration, we deployed a Protage RX stent 8.0\u00a0 mm \u00d7 60\u00a0 mm (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). Postdilation was performed with Rx-Genity 4.5\u00a0mm \u00d7 30\u00a0mm at 8 atm for 5 s. In the final image, the stenosis was well dilated, and the common carotid artery and intracranial internal carotid artery were well visualized [Figures\u00a04c and d]. ere was no neurological deficit after treatment and no change in NIRS monitoring during the intervention. No new ischemic lesions were observed on the postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Carotid ultrasonography showed that the outer diameter of the artificial vessel did not change, but the stenosis inside the artificial vessel was dilated [Figure\u00a05]. ere was no restenosis as of the 1-year follow-up appointment."

To prevent thrombosis, heparin-based ePTFE prostheses have recently been used, which have enhanced antithrombotic properties and inhibition of intimal growth.[14] However, artificial blood vessels are vulnerable to joint flexion and rotation. erefore, after femoral artery replacement using artificial blood vessels, loose clothing, Western-style toilets, avoidance of sitting on the floor, and avoidance of knee or hip joint flexion >90\u00b0 are recommended.\nTable\u00a01: Patency rate after carotid artery replacement with prosthesis.\nAuthor Year Indiccation (number of cases) Vessels used Bypass vessels (number of cases)\nMedian follow-up\nperiod(months)\nPatency rate (follow\u2011up years)\nCamaide et al.[1] 2003 Severe stenosis (45), stenosis related to tortuosity of the vessel (29), restenosis after Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) (18), technical failure in endovascular treatment (11), stenosis after radiotherapy (7) PTFE CCA-ICA (110) 21 97.4% (1), 95.0% (3) Huigol et al.[5]\n2006 Atherosclerosis (15), post-radiotherapy stenosis (4), stent stenosis and occlusion (3), reconstruction associated with carotid body surgery (2), traumatic dissection (1), graft stenosis (1), reconstruction PTFE CCA-ICA (7), SCA-ICA (2), AXA-ICA (1), AXA, AXA-ICA (1)\n51 89% (1), 74% (5)\nassociated with aneurysm resection (1), carotid artery occlusion after aortic graft replacement (1)\nAutologous vein CCA-ICA (3), SCA-ICA (8), AXA-ICA (4), Aorta-ICA (1)\n37 92% (1), 92%(5)\nRamdon et al.[8] 2019 Symptomatic stenosis (95), infection (2), trauma (2), aneurysm (6)\nPTFE CCA-ICA (86) 49 99% (1), 88% (10)\nAutologous vein CCA-ICA (19) 69 100% (1), 84% (10)\nCCA: Common carotid artery, ICA: Internal carotid artery, SCA: Superior cerebellar artery, AXA: Axillary artery, PTFE: Polytetrafluoroethylene\nFigure\u00a02: Carotid artery echocardiography (a: 4\u00a0years after surgery, b: 6\u00a0 years after surgery, arrow head: proximal anastomotic site).

Other reports have shown that the patency rate with artificial vessels was not significantly different from that of autologous veins.[5,8]\nAdditional reports have addressed the site of stenosis after replacement of the femoral artery with artificial grafts. Stenosis and occlusion are generally known to occur at the portion of the anastomosis between the artificial vessel and original vessel.[4,10,13] e main cause of stenosis in small-\u00a0and mediumsized artificial blood vessels is thought to be thrombosis in the early postoperative period and intimal thickening in the late period.[2,3,12] Based on in vivo experiments, it is now"

Studies of grafts at the femoral artery have reported that intimal damage was caused by external physical stimuli, resulting in prosthetic vessel stenosis.[12] Similarly, in this case, it may be possible that external physical stimuli to the neck, such as pressure on the neck, cervical rotation, and cervical flexion, caused intimal damage and thickening.\nTreatment of stenosis in artificial blood vessel\nere are few reports on the treatment of cervical artery stenosis after replacement with artificial vessels. Conservative treatment for asymptomatic stenosis is usually performed with antiplatelet medication; however, there are few reports of surgical intervention.[11] ere is only one report of carotid stenting for in-graft stenosis.[6] However, there are many reports on the treatment of femoral artificial artery stenosis, including direct reoperation, percutaneous balloon angioplasty, and stenting.\nIn this case, based on ultrasonography findings, the stenosis was thought to be mainly caused by fibrous components; therefore, the lesion was expected to be a comparatively hard component. Hence, although there was a risk of damaging the vessel graft itself, a PTA balloon with a slightly larger diameter than that of the artificial vessel was selected. In fact, the first PTA at 8 atm was not sufficient, and the second dilatation (performed at 14 atm) was required. Inflation pressure may need to be determined according to the pathology of the stenosis. Regarding the selection of the stent, an open-cell stent with a high radial force is recommended. Moreover, considering the low compliance of the prosthesis, we need to be mindful of potential migration of debris distally during the procedure."

Based on our experience, stenosis after cervical artery replacement can be safely and effectively treated with CAS. PTA with a noncompliant balloon and implantation of an open-cell stent may be effective in improvement of the stenosis and preventing restenosis."
