 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the antimicrobial properties of the chitosan-sodium alginate films with Ficus racemosa fruit extract. The paper showed the films have improved antioxidant properties, but examining antimicrobial effects could expand applications for active food packaging.

2. Optimize the concentration of Ficus racemosa fruit extract in the films to balance mechanical, barrier, optical, and antioxidant properties. The paper tested 3 concentrations, but further work could find an ideal formulation. 

3. Evaluate the performance of the films for specific food products, such as fruits, vegetables, or meats. Testing for effects on shelf-life and food quality during storage would demonstrate real-world applicability.

4. Incorporate additional natural extracts along with Ficus racemosa to create films with enhanced properties. Potential options could be extracts known to have antimicrobial, antioxidant, or other functional benefits.

5. Develop biodegradable packaging prototypes utilizing the chitosan-sodium alginate-Ficus racemosa fruit extract films. Assessing performance for containment, sealing, and handling would move the films closer to commercial potential.
