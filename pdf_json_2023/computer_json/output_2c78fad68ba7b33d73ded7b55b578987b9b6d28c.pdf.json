            "text": "Most industrial data, as much as 95%, is not connected and used [Bane, December 2020]. A 2022 study by the Manufacturing Institute indicates that 78% of companies are concerned about impending aging workforce and lack of knowledge transfer is estimated to cost large businesses $47 million per year due to time waste, missed opportunities, and delayed projects [Institute, July 2019]. This presents an opportunity for systematic approaches to organize, link, and contextualize the diverse and siloed industrial datasets into a knowledge representation that can support improved downstream analytics. Given a dataset of a particular modality, for example, textual log files, or manuals, there are techniques to create industry specific word embeddings and use such finetuned models for tasks such as classification [Khabiri et al., 2019]. Similarly, given tabular datasets, there are AI approaches described to classify and link values [Sankhe et al., 2021] based on the context embedding that surrounds a cell in a tabular setting. For timeseries datasets, there are multiple approaches to generate valuable insights such as data quality anomalies [Zerveas et al., 2021; Shrivastava et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2022]. The primary focus so far has been either on analyzing datasets for one modality (text, tabular, time series, etc.) and generating insights, or on task-specific learning from multiple modalities [Erickson et al., 2022]. Using this demonstration paper, we aim to address the gap of a systematic approach to leverage multiple such AI capabilities which may be data-modality-dependent and yet bring them together to create a unified representation of the multi-modal data sources thus enabling situational awareness."

            "text": "Microelectronic manufacturing and development is a complex process involving data distributed across multiple data sources, structured and unstructured, including master databases, operational applications (manufacturing execution systems, scheduling applications), process trace data repository, maintenance reports, tool manuals, ad-hoc documentation of historically interesting events. Current practices rely on expert knowledge to extract, harmonize, aggregate and analyze data, and is done independently and repeatedly for each use case. In many cases, the subject matter expert (SME) has to work with data scientist to capture their domain expertise into the end-to-end analysis cycle. There is a need to organize data into semantically meaningful entities and relationships and enable retrieval of semantically related data without detailed knowledge of schemas or query languages. It is also imperative that an SME is able to interact with such a system to not only consume it but also to organize data leveraging their domain knowledge. Such semantic representation can enable high-value use cases like root cause diagnosis. For example, search for \u201cmetal liner deposition\u201d returns data, documents referring to (1) \u201cmetal liner deposition\u201d (2) liner deposition tool (3) graphs with electrical measurements influenced by liner deposition (4) others\nIt is important to note that semantic representation of the data is not reliant on the existence of an ontology or an industry standard but instead derived \u201cbottoms-up\u201d from the operational data that reflects the dynamic state of the environment."

            "text": "An operations center monitoring a plant floor can receive 1000s of alarms every day. Responding to each alarm is a critical but challenging task as it involves manual iterative steps of identifying relevant data including historical reports, adjacent related equipment in P&IDs, IoT sensor readings, analyzing trends and patterns, and performing root cause analysis by understanding the state of the related systems. There is a high cost of misreading an alert or inaction. There is a need to contextualize these diverse data sources in an (semi)automated fashion into a unified knowledge representation (such as a knowledge graph) that provides proactive recommendations and 24/7 guidance to operators."

            "heading": "2 SiWare Overview",
            "text": "There are 4 key components of a SiWare flow (Figure 1):\n\u2022 Connect: User can connect to the heterogeneous data sources in their environment by staging the data in Object Storage like IBM COS1 or local file system and using the \\connect API.\n\u2022 Contextualize: User can initiate one or more contextualization flows by first invoking the \\contextualize\\initialize API to organize the data into a Collection which acts as a logical grouping of data that is needed for knowledge discovery. Each contextualization flow is aimed at extracting the knowledge - entities and relationships - from the collection and creates a graph representation. Examples of such flows include named entity recognition (NER) in a text data collection (\\contextualize\\ner API), or identifying relevant sensor correlations from a collection of sensor data (\\contextualize\\sensor API) informed by P&ID diagrams. The contextualization flows trigger AI models which run asynchronously returning a job id, the status of which can be queried using the \\status API. The completed flow may result in purging of the staged data based on the configuration. Each contextualization flow has a standard interface with inputs being a collection and a configuration file and outputs a .json artifact of entity-relationship mapping.\n\u2022 Fuse: The user can fuse the output of one or more contextualization flows into an industrial knowledge graph using the \\fuse API. The fusion service is responsible for reconciling the entities and relationships using either given business logic or inferred matching criteria [AlMoslmi et al., 2020]\n1https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage\n\u2022 Access: The user can query the unified knowledge graph using the \\access API. Predefined templates for industrial use cases allow the user to retrieve sub-graphs for root cause analysis given a problem, or creating data pipelines for developing a failure prediction model.\nThis plug-and-play architecture enables additional data modality-dependent AI-powered contextualization services to be added. For example, wafer monitoring in semiconductor manufacturing using scanning electron microscope images is a data source that could be added to connect, with wafer defect classification as a contextualization flow. Such classified defects can be fused in the knowledge graph. An engineer in the fab can now access historical defects which could have resulted from a similar anomaly in the measurements observed currently.\nThe ability to select and add new contextualization flows within the framework enables applicability in a wide variety of industrial use cases. Section 3 lists the deployment aspects and Section 4 describes the benefits in real-world usage."

Figure 2 presents the interaction screen for the NER contextualization flow where a domain expert can interactively train a deep learning model based on novel entity pattern extraction [Khabiri et al., 2022]. Figure 3 presents the interaction for a sensor correlation contextualization flow. The domain expert can optionally integrate a domain semantic model of known entities and relationships, in a property graph format, using the Knowledge Capture Service. This can bootstrap the discovery process. An example of such a domain semantic model is illustrated in figure 4. The semantic model represents the connection between the common entities like tool, chamber, route, lot, wafer etc. The contextualization flows enable the linking of the operational data to the semantic model.\n\u2022 The operator persona can consume the graph either through the web interface or via custom dashboards that are integrated with their workflow."

Every time a failure report is searched for, the access mechanism in SiWare traverses the knowledge graph to return a measurement set of the order of 10s of values from \u223c 500K total number of measurements. This has dramatically reduced the mean time to diagnose a problem. In addition, our study indicates SME time savings of 50% in creating a semantic model and using it for semantic search and related problem diagnosis.\nIn continuous flow manufacturing, SiWare is being used to provide all contextual information in a single pane of glass for an operator to respond to an alarm. Given information about the distributed control systems, sensors, alarms, operation logs, and P&IDs, SiWare continuously organizes the knowledge into a representation that can be used to dynamically fetch the context needed for alarm response. Our experiments indicate a reduction of 80% of time spent on situation understanding and response."
