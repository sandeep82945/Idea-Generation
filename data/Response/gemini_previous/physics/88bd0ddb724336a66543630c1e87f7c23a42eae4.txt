1. **Investigate the role of proline in the development of fibrosis in endometriosis.** Proline is an essential component of collagen, and its increased levels in endometriosis patients suggest that it may play a role in the development of fibrosis, a common feature of the disease. Future studies could examine the relationship between proline levels and the severity of fibrosis in endometriosis, as well as the potential of targeting proline metabolism as a therapeutic strategy.


2. **Explore the link between oxidative stress and threonic acid levels in endometriosis.** Threonic acid is a product of the oxidative breakdown of ascorbic acid, and its elevated levels in endometriosis patients suggest that oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Future studies could investigate the relationship between threonic acid levels and markers of oxidative stress in endometriosis, as well as the potential of antioxidants as a therapeutic strategy.


3. **Examine the impact of ketone body metabolism on immune function in endometriosis.** Ketone bodies are involved in energy production and have been shown to have immunomodulatory effects. The altered balance of ketone bodies in endometriosis patients suggests that it may affect immune function in the disease. Future studies could investigate the relationship between ketone body metabolism and immune cell function in endometriosis, as well as the potential of targeting ketone body metabolism as a therapeutic strategy.


4. **Investigate the role of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in the immune response in endometriosis.** BCAAs are essential amino acids that are involved in various biological processes, including immune function. The decreased levels of valine, a BCAA, in endometriosis patients suggest that it may play a role in the immune dysregulation associated with the disease. Future studies could examine the relationship between BCAA levels and immune cell function in endometriosis, as well as the potential of BCAA supplementation as a therapeutic strategy.


5. **Explore the relationship between tryptophan metabolism and immune dysfunction in endometriosis.** Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is involved in various biological processes, including immune function. The altered levels of tryptophan metabolites in endometriosis patients suggest that it may play a role in the immune dysregulation associated with the disease. Future studies could investigate the relationship between tryptophan metabolism and immune cell function in endometriosis, as well as the potential of targeting tryptophan metabolism as a therapeutic strategy.
