Optimization of Fermentation Processes for Scale-Up Production: Given the promising results of SL production in laboratory conditions, future research could focus on optimizing fermentation processes for scale-up production. This could include exploring alternative low-cost substrates, improving fermentation conditions, and scaling up the process from laboratory to industrial scale to make SL production more economically viable for large-scale application in CyanoHAB mitigation.

Development of Mixed Biosurfactant Systems: Investigate the synergistic effects of sophorolipids with other biosurfactants or bioactive compounds to enhance the degradation efficiency against cyanobacteria. This could involve testing combinations of lactonic and acidic SLs with other natural surfactants or antimicrobial agents to find mixtures with improved efficacy, stability, and environmental compatibility.

Environmental Impact and Ecotoxicological Studies: Conduct comprehensive environmental impact assessments and ecotoxicological studies to evaluate the long-term effects of SL application in aquatic ecosystems. This includes examining the fate of SLs in different water bodies, their impact on non-target organisms, and their degradation products' ecological safety.

Genetic Engineering of Other Microbial Strains: Extend the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing approach to other microbial strains capable of producing SLs or other effective compounds against CyanoHABs. By expanding the range of SL-producing microbes, researchers could potentially uncover more efficient or cost-effective production methods, as well as biosurfactants with novel properties.

Real-world Application and Monitoring: Design and implement pilot studies to apply SLs in real-world aquatic environments affected by CyanoHABs. This would involve monitoring the effectiveness of SL treatments in diverse conditions, assessing practical challenges in deployment and distribution, and evaluating the impact on cyanobacterial populations and overall water quality over time. Additionally, exploring the integration of SL application with other CyanoHAB management strategies could provide insights into holistic approaches for addressing this global issue.
