    "abstractText": "Gas-phase electrophoresis on a nano-Electrospray Gas-phase Electrophoretic Mobility Molecular Analyzer (nES GEMMA) separates single-charged, native analytes according to the surfacedry particle size. A volatile electrolyte, often ammonium acetate, is a prerequisite for electrospraying. Over the years, nES GEMMA has demonstrated its unique capability to investigate (bio-)nanoparticle containing samples in respect to composition, analyte size, size distribution, and particle numbers. Virus-like particles (VLPs), being non-infectious vectors, are often employed for gene therapy applications. Focusing on adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) based VLPs, we investigated the response of these bionanoparticles to pH changes via nES GEMMA as ammonium acetate is known to exhibit these changes upon electrospraying. Indeed, slight yet significant differences in VLP diameters in relation to pH changes are found between empty and DNA-cargo-filled assemblies. Additionally, filled VLPs exhibit aggregation in dependence on the applied electrolyte\u2019s pH, as corroborated by atomic force microscopy. In contrast, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy did not relate to changes in the overall particle size but in the substantial particle\u2019s shape based on cargo conditions. Overall, we conclude that for VLP characterization, the pH of the applied electrolyte solution has to be closely monitored, as variations in pH might account for drastic changes in particles and VLP behavior. Likewise, extrapolation of VLP behavior from empty to filled particles has to be carried out",

            "text": "Gene therapy alters the genetic information of an organism, replacing, supplementing, or modifying its genomic profile to enable hereditary disease treatment, as lately reviewed for hemophilia [1], for example. To convey new genomic information to a cell, cargo carriers are necessary to shield nucleotides from the environment and achieve their targeted transport. One possible carrier type is virus-like particles (VLPs), macromolecular assemblies resembling their parent virus but no longer being infectious due to a lack of viral genomic information [2]. Hence, VLPs can be engineered to encapsulate other genomic information in question. AAV are viruses of the genus Dependoparvovirus within the family Parvoviridae. They are approximately 26 nm in size, non-enveloped, non-pathogenic, and endemic in humans as well as several vertebrate species. To date, 13 serotypes have been identified in nature, each with a different tissue tropism. The capsid comprises 60 copies of three types of subunits: VP1, VP2, and VP3, arranged in a T = 1 icosahedral symmetry with a molar\nViruses 2023, 15, 1361. https://doi.org/10.3390/v15061361 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses\nratio of 1:1:10. Due to its small size, only 4.7 kb of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) can be encapsulated [3]. In this work, we took an interest in adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) modified to generate VLPs for gene therapy applications. AAV8 VLPs were provided in two different preparations: (i) lacking any genomic cargo (i.e., an \u2018empty\u2019 VLP preparation), and (ii) carrying a non-viral engineered genome (i.e., a \u2018filled\u2019 VLP preparation). A possible technique for (bio-)nanoparticle characterization in general and AAV8 in particular is gas-phase electrophoresis on a nano Electrospray Gas-phase Electrophoretic Mobility Molecular Analyzer (nES GEMMA), also known as nES Differential Mobility Analyzer (nES-DMA) [4]. This technique is based on the size separation of single-charged, surface-dry analytes in the gas phase. Transfer of analytes from a liquid sample\u2014a volatile electrolyte solution is a necessary prerequisite for the technique\u2014to the gas-phase is achieved via a nES process, followed by drying of droplets and concomitant charge equilibration of particles in a bipolar atmosphere induced by, for example, a 210Po \u03b1-particle source, a soft X-ray charger, or an alternating corona discharge process [5\u20138]. The majority of particles lose all charges upon passage of the bipolar atmosphere and are not regarded further, whereas a certain percentage of aerosolized analytes remains single-charged and are introduced to the DMA unit of the instrumentation. There, two forces act on the particles during size separation. Firstly, analytes are transported via a high laminar sheath flow of compressed, filtered ambient air through the DMA. At the same time, a tunable electric field exerts a force on charged particles in an orthogonal direction. By variation of the applied field strength and based on electrophoretic principles, only particles of a corresponding surface dry particle diameter (electrophoretic mobility, EM diameter) have the correct trajectory to continue to the detector unit of the instrument. There, particles are counted after a nucleation process in a supersaturated atmosphere as they pass a focused laser beam. This setup guarantees true particle-number-based detection of smaller-sized sample components next to larger ones in accordance with the recommendations of the European Commission (2011/696/EU, 18 October 2011, updated 2022) for nanoparticle characterization. The same instrumentation is also known under several other names, e.g., nES-DMA, macroIMS, SMPS or liquiScan ES (e.g., [9,10]). Since its first reference in the literature by Kaufman et al. in 1996 [4], gas-phase electrophoresis has been applied for the characterization of a multitude of (bio-)nanoparticle materials, such as viruses [11\u201313], VLPs [14\u201317], liposomes and lipoprotein particles [18\u201322], extracellular vesicles [23\u201325], and organic and inorganic nanoparticles [26\u201328]. Frequently, ammonium acetate is employed as an electrolyte solution for the nES process. However, ammonium acetate is no buffer per definition (i.e., ammonium acetate solution), and especially at neutral pH, it exhibits no buffering capacity. Hence, significant changes in pH occur upon drying of droplets generated in the nES process, as reported by Konermann in 2017 [29]. We now took interest in the question how AAV8-based VLPs would behave to such pH changes, focusing on a well-defined in-solution setup. Analyses were carried out via gas-phase electrophoresis, and we corroborated our findings by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) as orthogonal analytical techniques. All applied analytical techniques relate a pH dependency of AAV8 particles in aqueous ammonium acetate."

The nES unit is equipped with a 24 cm long polyimide-coated fused-silica capillary with an inner diameter of 25 \u00b5m (Molex, Lincolnshire, IL, USA). The capillary is manually cut and tapered with a home-built grinding machine based on the work of Tycova et al. [30]. Nanoparticle separation and detection were achieved with the following settings: the filtered airflow on the nES generator was set to 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 m3/s (1 L per minute, Lpm), the CO2 gas flow to 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 m3/s (0.1 Lpm, 99.5% from Messer, Gumpoldskirchen, Austria) and the differential capillary pressure at 27.58 kPa (4 pounds per square inch differential, PSID). Capillary conditioning was performed by pre-spraying each sample for at least 3 min before starting the measurement. Capillary rinsing was performed by infusing the electrolyte solution until the signal from the previous sample was no longer detectable. The sample was infused at a flow rate of 70 nL/min. The capillary tip voltage was set to have a stable Taylor cone (approx. 2 kV voltage and \u2212380 nA current). The electrostatic classifier was set in automatic scanning mode (up scan time 120 s, retrace time 30 s) with a sheath gas flow rate of 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 m3/s (15 Lpm), which yielded a range of measurable EM diameters between 1.95 nm and 64.9 nm. A total of 10 scans for each sample were used to generate a median spectrum. Mathematical and statistical calculations on the nES GEMMA spectra were made with the software OriginPro ver. 2021 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). AFM experiments were carried out on a NanoScope VIII Multimode SPM instrument (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) using silicon cantilevers with integrated silicon tips (model NCHV from Bruker, resonance frequency: 320 kHz, L = 125 \u00b5m, k = 42 N/m). The images were acquired in tapping, constant amplitude mode at a scanning rate of 1.99 Hz over a scan area of 5 and 1 \u00b5m2. The homogeneity of the mica platelet was tested prior to sample analysis. Subsequently, 10\u201320 \u00b5L of sample (5\u201320 \u00b5g/mL solutions) were spotted on the platelet\u2019s surface\nat room temperature. The sample was allowed to adsorb for 5 min undisturbed before being gently rinsed with UHQ water and dried with nitrogen gas (outlet pressure 350 kPa). Lastly, the AFM images have been analyzed by NanoScope Analysis 1.5 software (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Longitudinal and medial plane sections were used to generate profiles of the imaged particles. Cryo-TEM samples were prepared using Quantifoil (Gro\u00dfl\u00f6bichau, Germany) Cu 200 mesh R2/2 holy carbon grids which were glow discharged for 60 s at \u221225 mA with a Bal-Tec (Balzers, Liechtenstein) SCD005 glow discharger. Grids were mounted on forceps and loaded into a Leica GP (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria) grid plunger with the climate chamber set to 4 \u25e6C and 75% relative humidity. Sample aliquots of 4 \u00b5L were applied to the carbon side of the grid and front-side blotted for 2 s with Whatman filter paper #1 (Little Chalfont, Great Britain) and plunge frozen into liquid ethane at approximately \u2212180 \u25e6C for instant vitrification. Cryo-samples were transferred to a Glacios cryo-transmission microscope (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a X-FEG and a Falcon3 direct electron detector. The microscope was operated in low-dose mode and digital images were recorded using the SerialEM software [31] and the Falcon3 camera in linear mode at a defocus of \u22126 \u00b5m and 36,000 fold magnification corresponding to a pixel size of 4.124 \u00c5."

As previously introduced, nES GEMMA can be easily employed to analyze viruses and deliver robust, high-throughput, and cost-effective analyses. Moreover, orthogonal analytical techniques such as AFM in tapping mode and cryo-TEM have been applied to corroborate our results obtained from gas-phase electrophoresis. As already demonstrated in our previous work [35], nES GEMMA can discriminate between VLPs either carrying or lacking genomic information for the two individual sample types (Figure 1A). The small, albeit critical, difference in EM diameter between the two VLP preparations originates from the presence, or absence, of an encapsulated cargo (i.e., the genomic material). The discrimination is possible due to the operating conditions of nES GEMMA analysis, which induce evaporation of the hydrodynamic layer surrounding the particles, thus yielding surface-dry analytes. However, the surface drying effect seemingly propagates across the proteinaceous layer of the capsid to its core, as the VLP EM diameter is affected by the content of its cargo. Two possible outcomes can be surmised: in the presence of a payload, the particles mostly retain their original shape thanks to stabilizing forces emerging from protein-genome interactions. In the absence of a genomic load instead, a higher degree of deformation is allowed, thus making the particles more flexible and detectable at smaller EM diameters.\nViruses 2023, 15, 1361 5 of 11\nViruses 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 12\nVLP preparations originates from the presence, or absence, of an encapsulated cargo (i.e., the genomic material).

This drastically reduces non-volatile components, which hinder correct and accurate particle EM diameter determination. More details can be found in previous works [36,37]. To some extent, either for nES GEMMA or for ESI MS analysis, aqueous ammonium acetate is applied in that context. However, it has to be considered that ammonium acetate droplets might undergo drastic pH changes upon evaporation, as discussed by Konermann in detail [29]. Thus, we took an interest in investigating the effects of different pH levels on VLP preparations, either carrying a genomic cargo or not, and both suspended in aqueous ammonium acetate. Results are displayed in Figures 1B and 2A, respectively."

Reasonably, pH-driven protein modification alters capsid\u2019s structural stiffness in both VLP preparations, but empty ones are again more affected.

            "text": "Thanks to their distinct size differences, VLP preparations, either carrying or lacking cargo, can be easily discriminated (p < 0.0001, Figure 1B). In detail, filled VLPs have a constant higher EM diameter, and show a minimal downward trend towards a smaller EM diameter for alkaline pH. For empty VLPs instead, a sharper pH-dependent trend towards a smaller EM diameter is observed. Reasonably, pH-driven protein modification alters capsid\u2019s structural stiffness in both VLP preparations, but empty ones are again more affected. In addition, below a physiological pH level, a significant contrast in the number of detected particles between filled and empty VLP preparation is noticed (p < 0.0001, Figure 2A). A high detection yield for empty VLPs confirms that nES GEMMA capabilities are not hindered in an acidic working environment; hence, the observed difference for VLP preparations is sample-dependent. The unique behavior demonstrated by filled VLPs is of great importance, both for VLP analysis and in the biopharmaceutical field during manufacturing steps. In vivo, viruses commonly hijack the cellular uptake mechanism to infect the cells. A number of them take advantage of the acidic environment of late endosomes and endolysosomes to shed their proteinaceous layer to deliver their naked viral load directly into the cytoplasm. Other viruses instead\u2014AAV8 included\u2014need to survive and accomplish endosomal escape intact in order to complete the infection [38,39]. Therefore, it is unlikely that bionanoparticles depletion is caused by viral uncoating. Moreover, capsid fragments would be detected at EM diameters below 25 nm; still, the nES GEMMA signals in this region are negligible and comparable to empty VLP preparations at comparable pH levels.

Within the filled VLP preparation, the sample at pH 4 (Figure 3A(i)) shows a well-defined icosahedral capsid\u2019s structure with regular, straight edges, and clear vertices; at pH 9 (Figure 3A(ii)) the same characteristics are instead less pronounced. Whereas in the empty VLP preparation, regardless of the pH value, the capsid\u2019s structure appears smoother, rounder, and slightly smaller (Figure 3A(iii,iv)). Anticipated\nby nES GEMMA results, and now corroborated by cryo-TEM images, the particle\u2019s shape is linked with the presence or absence of an encapsulated cargo, and this could affect the capsid\u2019s interactions at the macromolecular scale. Diameter determination results in filled VLPs exhibiting larger diameters than empty ones, in agreement with nES GEMMA observations (p < 0.001, Figure 3B). Moreover, new information about the sample\u2019s characteristics can be inferred. In detail, empty VLPs report identical diameter values regardless of the solvent\u2019s pH, which is contrary to the downward trend observed with nES GEMMA. In hydrated conditions, regardless of the pH, empty VLPs maintain a constant size and shape. Filled VLPs instead show a small diameter variability between pH conditions, probably due to the sharper contours as reflected in the imaged particles (Figure 3A(i,ii)). Nonetheless, this slight visual and diameter difference does not provide any functional proof to explain the observed aggregation behavior."

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of nES GEMMA to discriminate, detect, and characterize novel behaviors of AAV8-based VLP preparations analyzed with nES GEMMA-compatible electrolyte solution adjusted to different pHs. Moreover, to observe the VLP preparations in their hydrated native state, cryo-TEM analysis was performed. Results from nES GEMMA of the two VLP preparations show peculiar, unique characteristics. Filled VLPs report limited EM diameter deviation across the different pHs, but detection efficiency is hindered in acidic conditions. Instead, the particle detection efficiency of empty VLPs is unperturbed by the electrolyte\u2019s pH, but pH-depended EM diameter variability is observed. Results from PEET-based cryo-TEM images highlight the structural differences between the two VLP preparations. Moreover, the developed method for biased-free diameter determination via cryo-TEM confirms size-specific differences between empty and filled VLP preparations as observed with nES GEMMA. However, within VLP preparations, pHdependent variation is observed, contrasting nES GEMMA results\u2014specifically, a constant diameter for empty VLPs and a variable one for filled VLPs. One hypothesis to explain the discrepancy observed between nES GEMMA and cryo-TEM resides in the different working environments of these techniques. In nES GEMMA, the particles are sorted and classified in a solvent-free environment and are in a surface-dry state. Consequently, empty VLPs, lacking an encapsulated cargo, collapse due to structural stress caused by solvent evaporation. Likely, the solvent\u2019s pH alters protein conformation, which translates to different degrees of structural stability or stiffness. Therefore, labile structures are detected at smaller EM diameters. Instead, filled VLPs remain unaffected, thanks to the incompressible characteristics of their payload. On the contrary, in cryo-TEM, the VLPs are analyzed in a solubilized native state. Indeed, empty VLPs are not subjected to structural stress from solvent evaporation, and maintain their original form. Filled VLPs instead show a slight difference between the two pH extremes. The origin of this difference is as yet unclear. Putatively, and in addition to pH-induced changes at the protein level in acidic conditions, an osmotic pressure difference is generated at the semipermeable membrane level (i.e., proteinaceous capsid layer) caused by the negative charges of the genomic cargo. Hence, solvent intake is favored to equilibrate the osmotic pressure, causing the particle to swell. In acidic conditions, nES GEMMA reveals a steep decrease in particle counts for filled VLPs, while empty ones are unaffected. Indeed, AFM analysis of filled VLPs in acidic conditions confirmed our hypothesis: the lower particle count was due to particle aggregation. Although nES GEMMA\u2019s working range of detection could be expanded, the heterogeneity of these clusters impedes their detection without an upstream enrichment technique, as observed in previous work [36]. Aggregation could be explained by the shape of the particles, highlighted by cryo-TEM-based PEET averaged images. The well-defined capsid faces of filled VLPs might provide the infrastructure for non-covalent capsid-tocapsid interaction, thus supporting aggregation. However, since no aggregate formation was observed in cryo-TEM averages, it suggests that the onset of aggregation requires\nfurther contributing factors. Once again, the critical factor might lie in the different working environments, dry in both nES GEMMA and AFM, and wet (i.e., plunge frozen in a solvent) for cryo-TEM. Putatively, if aggregation is promoted in a dry environment, it might be an evolutionary adaptation of AAV to increase viral infection transmission efficiency through airborne routes. The results presented in this study demonstrate the feasibility and resilience of nES GEMMA as a method of analysis for AAV Serotype-8 VLP preparations across different pH levels. This is of great importance, especially in overseeing the different phases of a drug production process, where simple, reliable, and inexpensive control is often sought. The results observed via AFM and cryo-TEM analysis provided complementary information to investigate the behavior observed with nES GEMMA when filled VLPs are exposed to acidic pH. AFM reveals the formation of heterogeneous aggregate products that could not be directly targeted with nES GEMMA but whose presence could be inferred by the significant drop in particle counts in the EM diameter range characteristic of VLPs in a monomeric state. Initially employed to investigate particle aggregation, cryo-TEM analysis did not confirm cluster formation observation. However, its extreme magnification power provided valuable information, and its application will propel future development toward the characterization of VLPs. To conclude, the developed method and analytical approaches presented in this study provided new insight and possible applications for both the scientific and the biopharmaceutical field. The observations herein open several discussion points, encouraging further studies to investigate such valuable drug-delivery vectors.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v15061361/s1, Figure S1: AFM analysis of filled VLPs at pH 5; Figure S2: nES GEMMA reversibility experiment of a filled VLP preparation; Python script to extract a planar section from the cryo-TEM 2D averaged images.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, V.U.W.; Formal analysis, S.Z.; Investigation, S.Z., T.H. and G.F.; Resources, T.H., G.F., R.P. and M.M.-D.; Writing\u2014original draft, S.Z. and V.U.W.; Writing\u2014review & editing, S.Z., R.P., M.G. and V.U.W.; Supervision, M.M.-D. and V.U.W.; Project administration, M.M.-D. and V.U.W.; Funding acquisition, R.P., M.G. and M.M.-D.
