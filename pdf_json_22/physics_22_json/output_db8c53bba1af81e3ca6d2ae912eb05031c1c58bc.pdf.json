            "text": "Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely believed to be thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs, Hoyle & Fowler 1960). As a class, they exhibit remarkable homogeneity in light-curves and are extremely luminous, making them ideal candidates to be used as standard candles for distance measurement on an universal scale. This property was notably used to first measure the accelerating expansion of the universe (Riess et al. 1998; Schmidt et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). They are also important contributors to the abundance of heavy elements and therefore chemical evolution in their host galaxies, making the subject of their progenitor systems of great importance in the field. However, there has been much debate over the nature of their progenitor systems in trying to explain the variation in observed properties, leading to a range of potential progenitor models. For instance, the single-degenerate (SD) scenario (Whelan & Iben 1973), the double-degenerate (DD) scenario (Iben & Tutukov 1984; Webbink 1984; Pakmor et al. 2010)\n? E-mail: zwliu@ynao.ac.cn \u2020 E-mail: r.izzard@surrey.ac.uk \u2021 E-mail: kuochuan.pan@gapp.nthu.edu.tw\nand the sub-Chandrasekhar double-detonation scenario (Taam 1980; Fink et al. 2007; Shen et al. 2010; Sim et al. 2010; Woosley & Kasen 2011; Gronow et al. 2020) have been proposed for producing SNe Ia. In addition, the exact explosion mechanism of SNe Ia remains unclear, although they are accepted to be thermonuclear explosions of WDs in binary systems (Hillebrandt et al. 2013; Maoz et al. 2014).\nThe SD and the DD scenarios have been widely studied over the past decades. In the DD scenario, two WDs with total mass > MCh \u223c 1.4 M merge because of gravitational wave emission in a binary or possibly through direct collision in a multiple system (Iben & Tutukov 1984; Webbink 1984; Raskin et al. 2009; Rosswog et al. 2009). This model finds explains the lack of observed hydrogen and helium lines in the late-time spectra of most SNe Ia and the delaytime distribution matches the observations well (Maoz et al. 2014). However, because the range of WD masses, about 0.7 \u2212 1.1 M , which could merge to produce SNe Ia is large, the DD scenario struggles to explain the observed homogeneity of SN Ia light-curves. In addition, it is unclear whether a slow WD-WD merger produces a type Ia supernova. It is instead possible that an accretion-induced collapse forms a neutron star (Nomoto & Iben 1985).\nIn the SD scenario, a WD accretes material from a main-sequence\nnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/m nras/stac1275/6582991 by U niversity of Surrey G eorge Edw ards Library user on 18 M ay 2022\nO R IG\nIN A\nL U\nN E D\nIT E D\nM A\nN U\nS C\nR IP\nT\n(MS), sub-giant (SG), red-giant (RG) or helium (He) star in a close binary system until the WDmass is close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, MCh, at which point the star explodes as an SN Ia (Whelan & Iben 1973; Han&Podsiadlowski 2004; Liu& Stancliffe 2018, 2020). The SN ejeta-donor interaction is expected to happen naturally in the SD scenario. The thermonuclear explosion ejects the ashes at speeds of order 104 km s\u22121, impacting the donor star and forcefully stripping material away from its surface, changing its structure and composition (Wheeler et al. 1975). The existence of the donor star leads to asymmetric ejecta with a cone-shaped cavity, and the ejecta-donor interaction could produce early UV flash (Kasen 2010; Liu et al. 2015; Liu & Stancliffe 2016). Additionally, the donor survives the explosion and should be identifiable by its unusual peculiar velocity. However, searches for such surviving donor stars have not yet borne fruit from the standard SD SN Ia channel (Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004; Ruiz-Lapuente 2019; Schaefer & Pagnotta 2012; Kerzendorf et al. 2009, 2014). Many numerical simulations have been constructed to investigate the interaction between SN Ia ejecta and a stellar donor in the SD scenario (e.g. Marietta et al. 2000; Pakmor et al. 2008; Pan et al. 2010, 2012a; Liu et al. 2012, 2013a,b,c; Boehner et al. 2017; Bauer et al. 2019; Zeng et al. 2020), using both grid-based and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods. It was found that> 0.1 M of hydrogen-richmaterial is unbound from anH-rich donor star in the SD scenario. As a result, the H lines caused by the stripped donor-star material are expected to be seen in late-time spectra of SNe Ia (Mattila et al. 2005; Boty\u00e1nszki et al. 2018). However, no H/He lines have been detected in late-time spectra of normal SNe Ia (e.g., Leonard 2007; Lundqvist et al. 2015; Maguire et al. 2016; Tucker et al. 2019) and only in two rapidly-declining, subluminous events (Kollmeier et al. 2019). This poses a serious challenge to the SD scenario for SNe Ia. However, most of previous impact simulations adopt either a simplified structure and composition of the SN ejecta or use the W7 model (Nomoto et al. 1984) to represent a SN Ia explosion. This leads to uncertainty not only in the stripped-mass calculation but also in the predictions of the H-line strengths in late-time spectra of SNe Ia because the exact explosion mechanism of SNe Ia is still unknown. A number of explosion models have been proposed to cover various progenitor scenarios of SNe Ia (Hillebrandt et al. 2013), including near Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration to detonation transitions (DDT) (Gamezo et al. 2005; R\u00f6pke et al. 2007; Khokhlov 1991; Seitenzahl et al. 2013), Chandrasekhar-mass deflagrations (Nomoto et al. 1984; Jordan et al. 2012; Kromer et al. 2013; Fink et al. 2014), gravitationally-confined detonations (Jordan et al. 2008; Seitenzahl et al. 2016), sub-Chandrasekhar-mass double detonations (Livne 1990; Woosley & Weaver 1994; Fink et al. 2007; Kromer et al. 2010; Gronow et al. 2020), violent mergers (Pakmor et al. 2010, 2011), and the collisions of two WDs (Raskin et al. 2009; Rosswog et al. 2009). Near Chandrasekhar-mass explosion models in the SD scenario have long been proposed as favourites for SNe Ia because they well reproduce some observational features such as their light curves and spectra (e.g., Hoeflich et al. 1995, 1996; Kasen et al. 2009; Blondin et al. 2011; Sim et al. 2013). The carbon deflagration model proposed by Nomoto et al. (1984), known as the W7 model, is commonly used. In this model, the ignition of carbon in the core propagates outwards as a subsonic burning front. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the contact between hot ashes and cold fuel increase the surface area of the front allowing it to engulf the entire star. More recently, Seitenzahl et al. (2013) proposed a suite of three-dimensional delayed-detonation models of near Chandrasekhar-mass WDs, most notably the N100 model in which 100 ignition sparks begin the\nexplosion deep inside the white dwarf (R\u00f6pke et al. 2012; Seitenzahl et al. 2013). Alternatively, in the delayed-detonation model, the propagating carbon-ignition flame accelerates to a supersonic velocity, resulting in a pressure wave which causes the surrounding fuel to auto-ignite.\nTo use observations of type Ia supernovae to determine their origin, we must compare observations to detailed models including the ejecta-donor interaction. Modelling the explosion mechanism correctly is vital to this comparison. Therefore, in this work, we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using two widelystudied near Chandrasekhar-mass explosion models within the SD progenitor scenario, i.e., the W7 and N100 models (Nomoto et al. 1984; Seitenzahl et al. 2013). We calculate how different explosion mechanisms alter the ejecta-donor interaction and expected observational properties, as required to place constraints on the progenitor systems and explosion mechanism of type Ia supernovae."

In our setup, we adopt Helmholtz equation of state (Timmes & Swesty 2000) which interpolates thermodynamic solutions from a table of the Helmholtz free energy including contributions from degenerate electrons and positrons, radiation sources and ionised particles. We use adaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) to ensure that small-scale turbulence and instabilities are resolved in locations of interest while computational time is reduced by derefining areas far from the donor star.

In our simulations we employ 12 levels of adaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) in the SN and donor-star regions, and a maximum of 10 levels of refinement outside these regions. We refer to this setup as the 10/12 level. This is equivalent to a uniform grid spacing of 6.1 \u00d7 107 cm (\u223c 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 R2) inside the star and supernova regions, and a maximum of 9.8 \u00d7 106 cm (\u223c 5.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 R2) outside of these regions. The cylindrical coordinates r, z lie in the ranges r = (0, 2 \u00d7 1012) and z = (\u22122 \u00d7 1012, 2 \u00d7 1012), which are about 12 times larger than the donor-star radius in each direction. To determine the robustness of numerical results, Pan et al. (2010) performed a convergence test using different maximum AMR levels from 6/8 to 10/12 in their 2D impact simulations with FLASH. They found that the differences in the results, e.g. to the unbound mass and kick velocity, given by these different resolution levels are not significant, and that level 10/12 is sufficient to study ejecta-donor-star interaction. In addition, the convergence tests of Pan et al. (2010)were performedwith a helium-star companionwhich ismore compact than our main-sequence donor. The turbulence generated from ejectacompanion impact is weaker in the main-sequence channel and we expect better convergence with main-sequence companions. Because the FLASH code is used in this work, albeit a newer version, and our initial setup and assumptions are similar to those of Pan et al. (2010), we use the recommended 10/12 level in all our simulations. We neglect orbital and rotational motion in our simulations because the SN Ia ejecta velocity (\u223c 104 km s\u22121) far exceeds the orbital velocity (a few \u00d7102 km s\u22121), and the two stars are tidally locked at the time of explosion so the donor surface also rotates at the orbital velocity."

The exploding star is located vertically above the figure, out of shot, and the blast wave moves downwards towards the donor. The SN ejecta expands freely for a few minutes then hits the surface of the donor star. The impact strips some H-rich material from and increases the pressure on the surface of the donor. A high-pressure shock is driven into the stellar interior and a bow shock develops in the outer regions which diverts SN ejecta material around the star. As the diverted material further expands around the donor star, the interstellar medium (ISM) is compressed in the downstream region (below the star in the figure).

The donor star expands because of the shock heating, and is totally out of hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium. By t = 6000 s, the donor starts returns to hydrostatic equilibrium as the interaction finishes and a relatively spherical remnant remains (Fig. 4f). At the same time, an expanded low-density envelope has forms in the outer region of the star. In addition, the centre of the donor star moves away from its original position because it receives a velocity kick because of momentum imparted by the SN ejecta during the interaction."

            "text": "A comparison of the interaction between theW7 and N100 explosion models at equal times after the supernova explosion is shown in Fig. 5. Both explosion models lead to similar interaction characteristics: a turbulent front behind the frontal bow shock, eddies to the sides of the rear of the star, and the teardrop-shaped plume ejected after the shock passes through the star in its entirety. The clearest difference is that the N100 explosion has faster ejecta, hence the interaction evolves more quickly than with W7 and strips more material from the donor star. Fig. 6 shows the unbound donor mass as a function of time using the two explosion models in our simulations. To determine whether the donor material is unbound, we calculate its total energy by summing the kinetic, potential and internal energies, Etot = Ekin + Epot + Eint, and if Etot > 0 the material is unbound. As shown in Fig. 6, the unbound donor mass stabilises about 5000 s after the explosion. The time-evolution of unbound mass is similar in both models, beginning with a steep rise as the shock front transfers momentum and thermal energy to the donor star, followed by a slight decrease during thermal relaxation which returns some material to a bound state. At the end of our simulations, we find that 0.293 M and 0.368 M of H-rich material, representing 25 and 31 per cent of the donor mass at the time of explosion, is stripped from the MS donor surface by the SN explosion using the W7 and N100 models respectively. Extra mass stripping in our N100 model is caused by the larger kinetic energy of the N100 explosion, 1.40 \u00d7 1051 erg (Seitenzahl et al. 2013), compared with W7 which has 1.23 \u00d7 1051 erg (Nomoto et al. 1984). Previous studies have found that more powerful ejecta generally strip more donor mass for a given donor model and binary separation, and the total stripped mass is linearly proportional to the SN kinetic energy (Pakmor et al. 2008; Pan et al. 2012a; Liu et al. 2013a). The stripped mass in our W7 model increases to 0.334 M if we scale it with a higher kinetic energy of 1.40 \u00d7 1051 erg. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 3, the outer SN ejecta of the N100model is more powerful than that of W7, hence N100 is also expected to strip more. As described in Section 1, the interaction between SN Ia ejecta and a donor star has been investigated by previous studies with both analytical methods, and two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations (e.g., Wheeler et al. 1975; Marietta et al. 2000; Pakmor et al. 2008; Pan et al. 2012a; Liu et al. 2012; Boehner et al. 2017). Most studies found that & 0.1 M can be stripped from a mainsequence donor star, from a red giant the whole envelope is stripped. In particular, Marietta et al. (2000) found that 15 per cent of the donor star is stripped in their HCV model. The HCV model has a mass M2 = 1.017 M , radius R2 = 6.8\u00d71010 cm and ratio of binary separation to radius A/R2 = 3.0 (Marietta et al. 2000). Compared to\nour main-sequence donor model, the HCV model is more compact and has a larger A/R2 (Table 1). The stripped mass in HCV increases to \u223c 0.2 M (Pan et al. 2012a, see their Fig. 12) if we reduce its A/R2 to 2.67 similarly to our model. Liu et al. (2012) found between 6 and 24 per cent depending on the MS donor model (see also Pan et al. 2012a). More recently, Boehner et al. (2017) predicted 21 \u2212 26 per cent of a main-sequence donor is stripped in their 2D simulations using FLASH. Our results are comparable with these previous studies. As shown in Figs. 2 and 1, our donor star is near the end of its main sequence at the time of SN explosion, hence it has a dense core with an extended envelope. This explains why our stripped mass is a greater than in Boehner et al. (2017), in which the donor stars are normal MS stars and they have a more compact envelope than our donor model. However, our stripped mass greatly exceeds the \u223c 1\u20135 per cent predictions of Pakmor et al. (2008, their\nTable 2). The differences are mainly caused by the detailed structure of the donor star models and binary separations at the moment of SN Ia explosion (Liu et al. 2012; Pan et al. 2012a; Boehner et al. 2017). Compared to our model, the main-sequence donor models of Pakmor et al. (2008) are more compact and have longer binary separations (i.e., they have a larger A/R2) so in their simulations less mass is stripped. For instance, model rp3_24a in Pakmor et al. (2008) has a binary separation of 4.39 \u00d7 1011 cm which is similar to our 4.48 \u00d7 1011 cm. However, our companion radius exceeds theirs (7.21 \u00d7 1010 cm) by a factor of 2.3. Additionally, model rp3_20a in Pakmor et al. (2008) has the same mass as ours (i.e., M2=1.17 M ), but their A/R2 = 4.5 exceeds ours (A/R2 = 2.67) by a factor of 1.7. If we assume that their rp3_20a model also has A/R2 = 2.67, their stripped mass increases to 0.19 M based on their Equation 4. The main differences between the main-sequence donor models of Pakmor et al. (2008) and ours are the different treatments of pre-SN mass-loss of the MS stars and the binary separations adopted at the moment of SN explosion, which have been discussed in detail in our previous work (Liu et al. 2012, their Section 4.1). Pakmor et al. (2008) start the mass accretion phase with less-evolved companion stars and they constructed their companion star models by rapidly removing mass while evolving a single main-sequence star to mimic pre-SN mass-transfer in a binary system. As a consequence, their models have a very large A/R2, and they are too compact to fill their Roche-lobe at the moment of SN explosion. In contrast, our main-sequence donor model is constructed by consistently following mass-transfer in a binary system. Our main-sequence star has a more extended structure and fills its Roche-lobe when the SN explodes.\nThe donor star receives a kick as a result of momentum transfer from the ejecta during the interaction. The time evolution of kick velocity behaves similarly to the stripped mass (Fig. 6). At the end of simulations (t = 104 s), the kick velocities are 73.8 km s\u22121 and 86.0 km s\u22121 in our W7 and N100 models respectively. The faster kick in the N100 model is probably because its ejecta have a higher kinetic energy than in W7. The movement of the donor away from its original position is seen in Fig. 4. The final spatial velocity of the surviving donor star is only slightly altered by the kick, with most of the velocity arising from its pre-explosion orbital motion."

            "text": "Hydrogen-emission lines will be seen in late-time spectra of SNe Ia, about a few hundred days after the explosion, if sufficient hydrogenrich material (> 0.001 \u2212 0.058 M , which depends on the distance of the observed SNe Ia) is stripped from the donor surface during the interaction of the explosion with the star (Mattila et al. 2005; Lundqvist et al. 2015; Boty\u00e1nszki et al. 2018; Dessart et al. 2020). Therefore, searching for hydrogen-emission lines in late-time spectra of SNe Ia should provide strong evidence in favour, or otherwise, of a SD progenitor system to observed Ia supernovae. To date, no hydrogen-emission lines have been detected in late-time spectra of normal SNe Ia (Leonard 2007; Lundqvist et al. 2013, 2015; Maguire et al. 2016; Shappee et al. 2016; Tucker et al. 2020). However, hydrogen features have been detected in late-time spectra of two fastdeclining, sub-luminous SNe Ia, SN 2018fhw (Kollmeier et al. 2019) and SN 2018cqj (Prieto et al. 2020). All this late-time observations limit the hydrogen-rich mass in type-Ia SN progenitor systems to 6 0.001 \u2212 0.058 M .\nThis observational upper limit to the stripped mass is less than our simulations predict, > 0.30 M , and our results are similar to previous studies (Marietta et al. 2000; Pakmor et al. 2008; Pan et al. 2012a; Liu et al. 2012; Liu & Stancliffe 2017; Boehner et al. 2017).

In Fig. 7, we show post-impact velocity distributions of strippedmaterial from the surface of our donor star in our two explosion models. The typical velocities of stripped material in our W7 and N100 models are 350 km s\u22121 and 500 km s\u22121, respectively, which are consistent with previous works (Marietta et al. 2000; Pan et al. 2012a; Liu et al. 2012).\nAdditionally, Marietta et al. (2000) suggests that the high-velocity tail of stripped material is an important diagnostic that allows discrimination between various donor models (see also Boehner et al. 2017). Here, we checkwhether the two explosionmodels investigated in this work can be discriminated similarly. Fig. 7 shows that although a high-velocity, & 1000 km s\u22121, tail is seen in both our explosions models, there is little difference between their velocity distributions.

            "heading": "4.3 Surviving donor stars",
            "text": "In the SD SNIa scenario, the donor star survives the explosion after ejecta-donor interaction. However, surviving donor stars are generally not expected in the double-degenerate scenario, although Shen et al. (2018) have recently suggested that a WD donor may survive in their D6 double-generate model. Therefore, searching for surviving donor stars in SN remnants (SNRs) is a promising way to distinguish between the SD and DD scenarios of SNe Ia (Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004; Ruiz-Lapuente 2019; Kerzendorf et al. 2009, 2013; Schaefer & Pagnotta 2012; Pan et al. 2014; Li et al. 2019).\nTo provide the predicted observational features of surviving donor stars for comparison with observations of SNRs, it is important to address long-term post-impact evolution of surviving donor stars based on the results of multi-dimensional hydrodynamical impact simulations. After the explosion, the surviving donor star becomes a runaway star. It escapes from the binary systemwith a spatial velocity caused mostly by its pre-explosion orbital motion. In Figure 8, we present 1D-averaged density (left panel) and entropy (right panel) profiles of our surviving main-sequence donor star at the end of our simulations with the W7 and N100 explosions. For comparison, the initial profiles of the donor star at the beginning of the simulations are also shown. The central density of the donor star decreases by about 50 per cent because of the shock that passes through the star. In addition, the donor star is impacted and heated during the interaction, and expands by a factor of about two by the end of our simulations. While the donor subsequently thermally relaxes, it is overluminous compared to its pre-explosion equilibrium state (Podsiadlowski 2003; Pan et al. 2012b, 2013; Shappee et al. 2013; Liu & Zeng 2020; Liu et al. 2021, 2022). For instance, Pan et al. (2012a) and Shappee et al. (2013) suggest that the post-impact main-sequence companion stars are significantly more luminous (up to about 10\u20131000 L ) within a few thousand years, depending on the main-sequence companion model. Using the approach of Liu & Zeng (2020), the 2D surviving donor model computed from our impact simulations in this work can be mapped into a 1D stellar evolution code such as MESA to follow their subsequent post-impact evolution for more than a few hundred years to obtain expected observational features (Pan et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2021, 2022). This is important to understand how different explosion models affect the observational features of the surviving main-sequence companion stars, and is useful in the search for such events in SN Ia remnants. This investigation will be performed in a forthcoming study."

            "text": "Our simulations are performed in 2D without considering the orbital motion and rotation of the binary system. This is expected to only slightly affect our results (Liu et al. 2012; Pan et al. 2012a) because these two velocities are slower than the typical ejecta velocity of 104 km s\u22121 by more than an order of magnitude. Pan et al. (2012a) have performed the ejecta-donor interaction in 2D and 3D for a given main-sequence donor model with the FLASH code. They find that the results of the ejecta-donor interaction are quite consistent in 2D and 3D if the orbital motion and spin of the star are not included. However, the orbital motion and spin can lead to slightly different results in 3D (Pan et al. 2012a, their Table 2). Future 3D simulations are still needed to make more strict theoretical predictions such as post-SN rotation features of the surviving donor star. For instance, exploring the post-impact spin features of the surviving donor star requires the impact simulation to be in 3D. In addition, the rotation of an accreting WD is not considered\nwhen we construct the donor model at the moment of SN explosion in our 1D binary evolution calculation. The accretion from the donor star spins up the WD, leading to a delay to spin down the WD before it explodes (i.e., the so-called \u201cspin up/spin down\u201d model, Justham 2011; Di Stefano et al. 2011). Because the spin-down timescale is quite uncertain, the donor star in the MS donor scenario could be any type of star from MS (short delay) to WD (long delay) at the time of explosion. In such a case, the amount of stripped donor mass and donor properties will very likely differ considerably from our results with a MS donor."

Specifically, two nearChandrasekhar mass explosion models, W7 (Nomoto et al. 1984) and N100 (R\u00f6pke et al. 2012; Seitenzahl et al. 2013), are adopted to represent the SN Ia explosion in our simulations. The main goal of this work is to investigate how different explosion models affect the results of ejecta-donor interaction such as the total amount of stripped donor material and the kick velocity received by the donor star during the interaction. We find that 0.30 M and 0.37 M are stripped from a typical 2.5 M main-sequence donor surface by the SN Ia explosion, in simulations with the W7 and N100 explosion models, respectively. Additionally, the donor star receives a kick velocity of about 74 km s\u22121 and 86 km s\u22121, respectively. The modal velocity (\u223c 500 km s\u22121) of stripped material in the N100 model exceeds that of the W7 model (\u223c 350 km s\u22121) by a factor of 1.4. We therefore conclude that our numerical results of ejecta-donor interaction are not significantly dependent on the studied two nearChandrasekhar-mass explosion models."
