Most existing parametric query optimization (PQO) techniques rely on traditional query optimizer cost models, which are often inaccurate and result in suboptimal query performance. We propose Kepler, an end-to-end learning-based approach to PQO that demonstrates significant speedups in query latency over a traditional query optimizer. Central to our method is Row Count Evolution (RCE), a novel plan generation algorithm based on perturbations in the sub-plan cardinality space. While previous approaches require accurate cost models, we bypass this requirement by evaluating candidate plans via actual execution data and training an ML model to predict the fastest plan given parameter binding values. Our models leverage recent advances in neural network uncertainty in order to robustly predict faster plans while avoiding regressions in query performance. Experimentally, we show that Kepler achieves significant improvements in query runtime on multiple datasets on PostgreSQL. 1 conclusion and futurework We introduced Kepler, a system that can robustly speed up parameterized queries using a learningbased approach.We extensively evaluated Kepler on PostgreSQL and demonstrated that (1) our novel candidate generation algorithm RCE can provide significant speedups in query execution latency, and (2) robust ML models can reliably predict faster plans while avoiding regressions. Interestingly, we observed that RCE-generated plans were often far better than exact cardinality plans, indicating that even a widely-used system as PostgreSQL has significant room for improvement. Evaluating Kepler on database platforms other than PostgreSQL is a natural next step;
