In this regard, the fabrication of porous films with high light trapping ability and a large contact area is crucial for the production of efficient PEC cells. In this report, anatase TiO2 thin films with a porous double-layered structure were successfully prepared using a conventional spin-coating deposition method. Various amounts of polystyrene spheres were used as a pore-templating agent to control the porosity of the films. A range of characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and photoluminescence were employed to assess the morphology, structural and optical properties of prepared TiO2 films. PEC measurements revealed that prepared double-layered TiO2 thin films exhibit porosity-dependent photocatalytic activity. For example, TiO2 films with an optimized porous structure demonstrated an increase in photocurrent density by a factor of \u223c2.23 (to 141.7 mA cm\u22122) and photoconversion efficiency improvement by a factor of \u223c2.14 as compared to non-porous double-layered TiO2 reference films. Absorbance and photoluminescence analysis confirmed that improved PEC activity can be attributed to increased light absorption by the porous structure and reduced charge carrier recombination.",

            "text": "Metal oxide-based semiconductor thin lms are frequently employed in industrial applications due to their versatility, simplicity of fabrication, abundance, and low cost. Among them, TiO2 thin lms are particularly popular because they can be utilized for the development of thin lm-based solar cells,1,2 gas sensors,3,4 UV detection,5,6 UV screening and protection of solar cells,7 superhydrophilic coatings,8,9 photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants,10,11 photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting,12,13 etc. In general, the efficiency of solar cells, gas sensing devices, photocatalytic, and photoelectrochemical devices is strongly dependent on interfacial contact area, i.e. the greater the latter, the better the device efficiency. Consequently, researchers oen use TiO2 in the form of nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods, nanoowers, and nanoakes.14\u201317 However, these nanostructures are frequently prepared under harsh and not environment-friendly conditions, such as the thermal treatment of titanium precursors in acidic environments. Moreover, the active region of these nanostructured substrates is frequently\nniversity, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan. 172-70-60-26 ity, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan tion (ESI) available. See DOI:\n34488\nlimited to small-sized specimens with several square centimeters, which are unsuitable for large industrial processes. In this regard, a facile methodology for deposition of porous TiO2 thin lms with high surface area appears to be promising for industrial scalability.\nSeveral methods for deposition of porous TiO2 thin lms have been reported in the literature, including spray-pyrolysis deposition,18 the sol\u2013gel method,19 dip-coating,20 inkjet printing combined with low-temperature plasma treatment,21 and spin-coating combined with a dip-coating process.22 Among them, the sol\u2013gel and spin-coating methods appear to be promising due to their simplicity and versatility. However, noneven thickness and non-uniform pores that form as a result of the removal of the polymeric molecules also limit the use of TiO2 lms prepared by the sol\u2013gel method. In this regard, the spin-coating process of TiO2 slurry paste with polymeric spheres provides high exibility in thickness variation (via rotation speed) and control over pore size and density (via selection of polymeric sphere size and quantity). In our study, we used polystyrene spheres (\u223c350 nm in diameter) as a templating agent to deposit TiO2 lms with variable porosity. To the best of the authors' knowledge, porosity-dependent PEC activity testing of double-layered porous TiO2 thin lms prepared by spincoating has not yet been reported in the literature. Hence, the main novelty of our work lies in the systematic exploration of porosity-dependent photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity within\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In all cases, a dense layer of TiO2 is deposited rst, followed by a second layer with variable porosity. Nonporous double-layered TiO2 lm was used as a reference. In general, high surface porosity can increase the light scattering effects as well as the contact area at the junction of the semiconductor\u2013electrolyte. On the other hand, surface porosity should be controlled because it leads to the formation of cracks and defects, which limits the ow of charge carriers and increases charge recombination.\nFig. 2A\u2013C shows the SEM images of as-fabricated TO, TO200, and TO400 lms. Pore sizes ranging from \u223c300 to 350 nm indicate that pores form aer the thermal removal of PS particles. The porosity of TO200 and TO400 lms are clearly different, with TO400 having a greater number of holes than TO200 (Fig. 2B and C). SEM analysis revealed that the average pore size of TO200 lms was 285 \u00b1 40 nm, while the average pore size of TO400 lms was around 392 \u00b1 189 nm. The larger mean pore size for TO400 lm can be attributed to the merging/ localization of several PS particles in a specic region, which results in larger holes aer the heat treatment process.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34482\u201334488 | 34483\nFig. 1 General fabrication scheme of double-layered porous TiO2 films.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In particular, measured photocurrent densities for TO, TO200, and TO400 lms were found to be \u223c63.60 mA cm\u22122, \u223c141.7 mA cm\u22122, and \u223c91.70 mA cm\u22122, respectively. In the dark, all samples had a negligible photocurrent density. The onset potentials were estimated to be \u223c0.25 V vs. RHE for TO and TO200 lms, and \u223c0.31 V vs. RHE for TO400 lms. Chronoamperometry analysis (Fig. 3B) displays that the lms are structurally stable and that the same photocurrent density can be maintained with periodic light on\u2013off switches. The fact that the photocurrent density of the TO lms was the lowest indicates that surface porosity is important in PEC activity. On the other hand, the TO400 sample has a lower photocurrent density than the TO200 sample, suggesting that a lm with higher porosity does not always imply better performance. Nevertheless, the photocurrent density of TO400 lms was still better than that of bare TO lms. According to recent literature analysis (Table 1), the TO200 lm was found to be signicantly better as compared to some TiO2 nanostructures reported recently. TO200 lms, for example, exhibit higher photocurrent density generation than TiO2 nanotube and nanosheet arrays, highlighting their high potential for photocatalytic reactions.\nTable 1 Photocurrent density of some reported TiO2 nanostructures\nComposition and structure\nSingle-layer inverse-opal like TiO2 thin lms deposited by spin-coating TiO2-rGO thin lm deposited by spin-coating TiO2 thin lm (\u223c300 nm) prepared by pulsed laser deposition Tin oxide decorated tungsten oxide doped TiO2 nanotubes Pristine TiO2 nanotubes Black (reduced) TiO2 nanotubes TiO2 nanosheet array TO200 double-layered porous thin lm\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

It should be noted that while XPS analysis is shown for optimal TO200 lm, similar results are obtained for TO and TO400 lms as well (data not shown). The binding energies of the Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 peaks (Fig. 5A) are shown to be 464.1 and 458.4 eV, respectively, conrming the presence of Ti4+.27 The core level of O 1s can be tted to two peaks centered at 531.6 and 529.9 eV (Fig. 5B), which are assigned to adsorbed water and Ti\u2013O, respectively.7,28 Thus, XPS analysis conrmed the formation of pure TiO2 structures in all lms, implying that surface porosity should be considered as the only factor responsible for increased PEC activity.\nAbsorbance and PL measurements of prepared lms were subsequently conducted inside the integrating sphere. Fig. 6A shows that all lms have a high absorbance up to 390 nm,\nFig. 6 (A) Absorbance and (B) photoluminescence of TO, TO200, and T\n34486 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 34482\u201334488\nwhich corresponds to the bandgap electron transition in the anatase TiO2 structure (cutoff wavelength \u223c387 nm). On the other hand, TO200 and TO400 lms have higher absorbance in the UV and visible ranges, highlighting the benecial role of light scattering effects on PEC activity. Typically, TO200 lm has slightly higher absorbance than TO400 lm, which can be attributed to higher TiO2 content in TO200 lms (less porous as compared to TO400). Hence, TO200 lm has optimal porosity level which in turn can maximize the light scattering effects.\nTauc's equation was applied further to estimate the bandgap values of all prepared lms. Fig. S2 (ESI\u2020) yielded the bandgap values of \u223c3.211 eV (TO), 3.247 eV (TO200), and 3.242 eV (TO400). All values are close to the anatase TiO2 bandgap value of \u223c3.2 eV, indicating that bandgap variation was negligible for all lms. Steady-state PL analysis (lexc = 310 nm) was performed to analyze the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers. In general, peaks up to \u223c390 nm can be attributed to direct electron\u2013hole recombination, whereas peaks in the blue-green\nO400 films.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

It should be pointed out that the TO400 sample also demonstrate better PEC activity, absorbance, and a lower recombination rate when compared to the TO reference. Hence, in both cases the porosity level playing an important role in boosting the PEC activity. Despite having more pores, TO400 lm has poorer charge transporting properties than TO200 lm probably due to a larger number of cracks/larger voids formed during PS particles removal (Fig. 2C) and consequently a higher charge recombination rate, as conrmed by PL analysis. Moreover, it was shown that the poresize-decreased structure performs better than the pore-sizeincreased structure in spite of their comparable radiation absorption coefficients.30 Typically, TO400 lms have largersized voids that are most likely the result of several merged PS particles removed during the thermal treatment. Thus, the porosity level of TO200 lm has been found to be optimal in terms of both light absorbance and PEC activity enhancement. It should be noted that these results are valid for PS particles with a diameter of \u223c350 nm, and other sizes should be veried separately. Typically, lms with different sizes of PS particles and variations in lm thickness will be carried out in the forthcoming research."

We showed that porosity level is important in terms of effective light absorbance/scattering and should be optimized to achieve high PEC activity. Several lms with various porosity were prepared and tested for PEC activity. We showed that a lm with an optimal porosity level (TO200) can increase PEC activity by more than 2.2 times, with a photocurrent density of \u223c141.7 mA cm\u22122 at 1.23 vs. RHE. Further increase in porosity was found to be detrimental to PEC activity, which can be attributed to the appearance of a bigger amount of small cracks/voids in lms. It was suggested that more research in this area is required, typically by varying the size of PS particles and optimizing lm thickness.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing nancial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to inuence the work reported in this paper."
