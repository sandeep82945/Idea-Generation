Development of Novel Extraction Techniques: While the paper discusses the effectiveness of current extraction methods like UAE and PLE, there's potential for the development and evaluation of new, more efficient, and sustainable extraction technologies. These could focus on increasing the yield and purity of phenolic compounds while reducing energy consumption and solvent use. The exploration of hybrid extraction techniques or advancements in supercritical fluid extraction parameters could provide innovative ways to optimize the extraction process further.

Bioavailability Enhancement Studies: The paper highlights the issue of limited bioaccessibility and stability of phenolic compounds. Future research could focus on the development of delivery systems (such as nanoemulsions, liposomes, or microencapsulation) to enhance the bioavailability and stability of these compounds throughout the digestive process. This research could extend to evaluating the efficacy of these delivery systems in vivo, potentially in human clinical trials, to ascertain their impact on the bioactivity of phenolic compounds.

Gut Microbiota Interaction and Mechanistic Studies: Given the initial insights into the interaction between phenolic compounds and gut microbiota, there is a vast area of research available in understanding these mechanisms in detail. Studies could focus on identifying specific phenolic compounds or their metabolites that most significantly influence the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota. Moreover, research could explore how these interactions contribute to health benefits, such as obesity prevention or reduction of inflammation.

Comparative Studies on Phenolic Compounds Across Different Plants: While Hibiscus sabdariffa is identified as a rich source of phenolic compounds, comparative studies involving multiple plant sources could uncover other plants with potentially higher concentrations or more effective phenolic profiles. Such research could involve cross-species analysis using advanced extraction and analytical techniques to identify new sources for functional food and nutraceutical applications.

Longitudinal Human Clinical Trials: The paper suggests the bioactive potential of Hibiscus phenolic extracts against obesity and related disorders. Future research could design and conduct longitudinal human clinical trials to evaluate the long-term effects and safety of dietary supplementation with these extracts. These studies would provide valuable insights into dosage, efficacy, and potential side effects, significantly contributing to the development of phenolic compound-based therapeutics or functional foods.
