    "abstractText": "Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility and impact of a risk-targeted behavioral activation intervention for work-disabled individuals with comorbid pain and depression. Methods: The design of the study was a single-arm non-randomized trial. The sample consisted of 66 work-disabled individuals with comorbid pain and depression. The treatment program consisted of a 10-week standardized behavioral activation intervention supplemented by techniques to target two psychosocial risk factors for delayed recovery, namely, catastrophic thinking and perceptions of injustice. Measures of pain severity, depression, catastrophic thinking, perceived injustice, and self-reported disability were completed pre-, mid-, and post-treatment. Satisfaction with treatment was assessed at post-treatment. Return to work was assessed at 6-month follow-up. Results: The drop-out rate was 18%. At treatment termination, 91% of participants indicated that they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201ccompletely\u201d satisfied with their involvement in the treatment program. Significant reductions in pain (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.71), depression (d = 0.86), catastrophic thinking (d = 1.1), and perceived injustice (d = 1.0) were observed through the course of treatment. In multivariate analyses, treatment-related reductions in depression, catastrophic thinking, and perceived injustice, but not pain, contributed significant unique variance to the prediction of return-to-work outcomes. Conclusions: Risk-targeted behavioral activation was found to be an acceptable and effective intervention for workdisabled individuals with comorbid pain and depression. The findings suggest that interventions targeting psychosocial risk factors for pain and depression might contribute to more positive recovery outcomes in work-disabled individuals with comorbid pain and depression.

The treatment program consisted of a 10-week standardized behavioral activation intervention supplemented by techniques to target two psychosocial risk factors for delayed recovery, namely, catastrophic thinking and perceptions of injustice. Measures of pain severity, depression, catastrophic thinking, perceived injustice, and self-reported disability were completed pre-, mid-, and post-treatment. Satisfaction with treatment was assessed at post-treatment. Return to work was assessed at 6-month follow-up.\nResults: The drop-out rate was 18%. At treatment termination, 91% of participants indicated that they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201ccompletely\u201d satisfied with their involvement in the treatment program. Significant reductions in pain (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.71), depression (d = 0.86), catastrophic thinking (d = 1.1), and perceived injustice (d = 1.0) were observed through the course of treatment. In multivariate analyses, treatment-related reductions in depression, catastrophic thinking, and perceived injustice, but not pain, contributed significant unique variance to the prediction of return-to-work outcomes.\nConclusions: Risk-targeted behavioral activation was found to be an acceptable and effective intervention for workdisabled individuals with comorbid pain and depression. The findings suggest that interventions targeting psychosocial risk factors for pain and depression might contribute to more positive recovery outcomes in work-disabled individuals with comorbid pain and depression.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05 17442.

            "text": "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMD) are a leading cause of disability [1]. In North America, WRMDs rank among the most expensive nonmalignant health conditions affecting the working-age population [1]. Depression has been identified as a risk factor for problematic recovery outcomes of WRMDs [2, 3]. Depressive symptoms contribute to lower productivity and extended periods of sick leave in individuals with WRMDs [3\u20135]. Depressive symptoms have also been associated with longer duration of salary indemnity benefits following work injury or surgical intervention [6, 7]. Estimates of the prevalence of clinically significant depression associated with work-related musculoskeletal pain range from 20 to 40%, thus making the effective management of disability associated with comorbid pain and depression a pressing clinical concern [8, 9].\nTraditional approaches to the clinical management of comorbid musculoskeletal pain and depression have included referrals to mental health services for pharmacotherapeutic or psychotherapeutic treatment or the provision of psychological services within multidisciplinary pain programs [10\u201313]. While symptomatic treatment is an important component of the clinical management of pain and depression, the results of several investigations suggest that symptom-focused interventions, whether aimed at reducing symptoms of pain or depression, yield only modest reductions in work disability [14\u201316]. Some symptom-focused interventions, such as the use of opioids for the treatment of persistent pain, have actually been shown to contribute to longer periods of work disability [17]. It has been suggested that reducing disabilityrelevant risk factors associated with pain and depressive symptoms might lead to more positive return-to-work outcomes than interventions that focus exclusively on symptom reduction [16, 18\u201320]. To date, research has yet to address the impact of risk-targeted treatment on workdisabled individuals with comorbid pain and depression.\nThe present study examined the feasibility and impact of a 10-week standardized risk-targeted behavioral\nactivation (RTBA) intervention designed to promote occupational re-engagement in work-disabled individuals with comorbid pain and depression. Behavioral activation is an evidence-based treatment for depression focusing on goal setting, activity scheduling, and problem-solving [21]. The behavioral activation intervention was supplemented with techniques specifically designed to reduce psychosocial risk factors for prolonged work disability, namely catastrophic thinking and perceived injustice. Catastrophic thinking refers to the tendency to anticipate the worst possible outcomes of one\u2019s health or mental health condition [22]. Perceived injustice has been conceptualized as an appraisal process characterized by a tendency to construe one\u2019s losses as severe and irreparable and to attribute blame to others for one\u2019s suffering [23]. High scores on measures of catastrophic thinking and perceived injustice have been shown to prospectively predict more intense symptoms of pain and depression and more prolonged periods of work absence [24\u201326].\nA distinguishing feature of the present study was that occupational reintegration, as opposed to symptom reduction, was the primary objective of treatment. Although research has shown that prolonged work absence is associated with a wide range of adverse health and mental health outcomes, injured workers do not necessarily view occupational resumption as conferring health or mental health benefits [27\u201330]. Individuals with distressing health or mental conditions readily accept treatments designed to reduce symptom severity; however, they typically do not actively seek out interventions designed to promote occupational reintegration. It is not clear whether an intervention with a stated primary objective of promoting occupational reintegration would be viewed as acceptable by individuals who are absent from work due to comorbid pain and depression.\nIn addition to examining the feasibility and impact of the RTBA intervention, the present study also addressed whether treatment-related reductions in catastrophic thinking and perceived injustice contribute to more positive return-to-work outcomes. Before advocating for the inclusion of risk-targeted techniques in treatment programs aimed at fostering occupational reintegration, it is necessary to demonstrate that reductions in disability-relevant psychosocial risk factors are associated with more positive return-to-work outcomes. Although previous research has shown relations between disabilityrelevant psychosocial risk factors and prolonged work absence, there is currently no evidence that reducing catastrophic thinking or perceived injustice fosters better occupational reintegration in individuals with comorbid pain and depression.\nThe objectives of the present study can be summarized as follows: to determine (1) whether the RTBA\nintervention was acceptable to participants, (2) whether participants were satisfied with the RTBA intervention, (3) whether the RTBA intervention yielded meaningful reductions in symptom severity and disability-relevant psychosocial risk factors, (4) whether the RTBA intervention yielded meaningful reduction in occupational disability, and (5) to identify the treatment-related changes most predictive of occupational re-engagement."

Numerous investigations have supported the use of behavioral activation as an effective treatment for depression [31]. There are also indications that behavioral activation might improve return-to-work outcomes in individuals with chronic depression [32]. The behavioral activation component of the treatment program focused on goal setting, structuring and scheduling activities, increasing success and achievement experiences, and problem-solving. In order to maximize the impact of behavioral activation on disability reduction, goal setting and scheduling of activities focused primarily on resumption of discontinued activities as opposed to focusing on the scheduling of pleasant activities. The objective of goal setting and activity scheduling was to reduce the\ndiscrepancy between the client\u2019s pre-injury activity repertoire and the client\u2019s current activity repertoire.\nBehavioral activation was supplemented by a collection of techniques designed to reduce catastrophic thinking and perceptions of injustice [20, 26]. Techniques for reducing catastrophic thinking included education, guided disclosure, and increasing behavioral flexibility. Techniques for reducing perceptions of injustice included validation, identifying sources of the client\u2019s perceptions of injustice, and injustice-focused problem-solving. The intervention also involved engaging with the primary care professional, the case manager, and the employer to collaborate on the development of a safe and sustainable return-to-work plan.\nParticipants first viewed an introductory video that provided an overview of the procedures and objectives of the treatment program. The content of the video clearly identified return to work as a central objective of the treatment program. A client workbook was used for activity scheduling and to guide participants through exercises aimed at reducing catastrophic thinking and perceived injustice.\nTreatment was provided in one of 4 participating physical rehabilitation clinics. When a prospective participant was identified, the study coordinator made a referral to the clinic that was in closest proximity to the participant\u2019s community of residence. Clinicians met individually with participants once per week for a total of 10 weeks. The duration of treatment sessions was 50 min. The clinicians for the study included 10 rehabilitation professionals (9 occupational therapists, 1 physiotherapist). All clinicians for the study followed a 2-day training workshop to acquire the skills necessary to deliver the intervention. Clinicians received weekly supervision by a senior clinician with extensive experience in risk-targeted behavioral activation."

            "text": "Feasibility challenges of the present study included participant enrollment and retention in the intervention program. Given that disability reduction is likely seen as a less attractive treatment objective than symptom reduction for individuals with debilitating pain and depression, it was not clear that individuals would volunteer to participate, and fully engage, in the treatment program. The results of the study suggest that it is possible to enroll and engage individuals with debilitating pain and depression in the RTBA intervention. In the present study, of 66 individuals who were invited to participate in the intervention, 90% agreed to view the introductory video, and all individuals who viewed the introductory video agreed to enroll in the intervention program. Only 12 participants (18%) discontinued the intervention program prematurely. Of the participants who completed the intervention, 91% indicated that they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201ccompletely\u201d satisfied with the treatment they received.\nA related feasibility challenge was whether physical therapists and occupational therapists would be able to provide a mental health treatment with the level of proficiency necessary to yield meaningful clinical improvement. It was anticipated that participant retention would be determined, at least to some degree, by participants\u2019 subjective experience of improvement. The results of the study showed that participation in the intervention was associated with clinically significant reductions in pain severity (medium effect size), depression (large effect size), and self-reported disability (large effect size). The effect sizes for reductions in pain severity and selfreported disability were comparable to those that have been reported in work-disabled individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain participating in pain management interventions [49\u201351]. The magnitude of reductions in PHQ-9 scores was comparable to that reported in clinical trials of behavioral activation therapy for patients with major depressive disorder [52, 53].\nTo our knowledge, this is one of only two papers to document the effects of a rehabilitation intervention for individuals with comorbid pain and depression where return to work was a primary outcome variable. At\n6-month follow-up evaluation, 57% percent of the study sample had resumed some form of employment. Ernsteen et\u00a0al. [54] reported 76% of participants with comorbid pain and depression had returned to work after a 57-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention. While yielding more positive return-to-work outcomes than the present study, it is important to consider that the costs associated with a 57-week multidisciplinary intervention would likely be prohibitive for many disability insurers and would likely be beyond the acceptable duration of treatment for many work-disabled\u00a0 individuals. Ernsteen et\u00a0al. did not report data on acceptability of the rehabilitation program to the target population.\nIt is useful to compare the return-to-work outcomes of the present study with the return-to-work outcomes of rehabilitation interventions that have been offered to individuals with musculoskeletal pain of a similar level of chronicity, but without comorbid depression. Poulin et\u00a0al. [55] reported that 55% of participants with persistent\u00a0 pain who completed a 4-week (120 h) multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention has resumed employment when assessed at 3-year follow-up. Brendbekken et\u00a0al. [56] reported that 45% of participants with persistent\u00a0 musculoskeletal pain had returned to work when assessed 12 months following completion of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program. The results of several studies converge to suggest that multidisciplinary rehabilitation for individuals with persistent\u00a0pain can be expected to yield return-to-work rates of approximately 50% [57]. Given the data showing that depression markedly reduces the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for chronic pain, the 57% return-to-work outcome observed in the present study would be considered a favorable outcome for a sample with comorbid pain and depression.\nIn univariate analyses, reductions in pain severity, depression, catastrophic thinking, and perceived injustice were associated with higher probability of return to work. In multivariate analyses, reductions in depression, catastrophic thinking, and perceived injustice, but not pain, contributed significant unique variance to return-to-work outcomes. Previous studies have also reported that pain reduction predicts return to work in univariate analyses, but not when controlling for pain catastrophizing or perceived injustice [16, 23]. The findings suggest that reduction in pain might influence return-to-work outcomes as a function of its association with pain-related psychosocial risk factors. In previous research, depression, catastrophic thinking, and perceived injustice have been identified as risk factors for delayed recovery in individuals with musculoskeletal pain [24, 58]. The findings of the present study join a growing body of literature suggesting that targeting\npsychosocial risk factors such as catastrophic thinking and perceived injustice in the treatment of individuals with debilitating health or mental health conditions contributes to reductions in disability, beyond the variance accounted for by treatment-related reductions in symptom severity [16, 59\u201361].\nStrengths of the treatment approach used in the present study was the use of a structured behavioral intervention originally developed for the treatment of depression and inclusion of techniques specifically designed to reduce catastrophic thinking and perceived injustice. Another advantage of the treatment approach used in this study is the low cost of the intervention. RTBA is delivered by one clinician for a maximum of 10 direct contact hours. As such, the cost of treatment (approximately $1.5 k) is only a fraction of the costs associated with multidisciplinary treatment (range $10\u201335 k). As well, the brief duration of training required to equip clinicians with the skills necessary to deliver RTBA is such that accessibility of the intervention can be readily scaled up to meet the treatment needs of the client population in any given region or jurisdiction. The duration of training required to achieve competency in the delivery of structured behavioral activation interventions is considerably shorter than what would be required to train allied health professionals in the delivery of other psychosocial interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).\nAnother advantage of the RTBA intervention used in the present study is that it can be offered as a treatment even when clients are being followed by a psychotherapist. Since the clinicians who delivered the RTBA intervention were not psychotherapists, there would rarely be occasion when the intervention could not be offered in combination with psychotherapy. The orientation of RTBA would be considered conceptually compatible with several psychotherapeutic orientations such as CBT, behavior therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy. RTBA would be less conceptually compatible with psychotherapeutic orientations that have a more passive or palliative character.\nEarly detection of depression consequent to musculoskeletal injury remains a challenge due to the service and policy infrastructure within which musculoskeletal injuries are managed. Contact with a health professional able to diagnose depression would be atypical within the pathways of care provided to individuals being treated for work-related musculoskeletal injuries [62, 63]. Assessment of depression is not a routine part of primary medical care for patients presenting with a musculoskeletal injury. As well, insurers are often reluctant to refer clients for psychiatric or psychological consultation due to concerns about increases in claim costs. As a result,\ndepression continues to be under-detected and undertreated in individuals with musculoskeletal conditions [13].\nThere are several limitations to the present study that invite caution in the interpretation of the study findings. An important limitation was that the study did not include a control group. As well, given the pragmatic nature of the trial, participants continued with treatments that were prescribed by their treating physician. All participants were receiving some form of treatment for pain or depression. Consequently, it is not possible to unambiguously attribute clinical outcomes to the effects of the RTBA intervention. However, most participants who were taking medication for pain or depression had been doing so for a considerable time before entering the trial, making it unlikely that the results could be attributed to the effects of pharmacological treatment. The modest sample size also limited the nature of analytic techniques that could be applied to the data. The present study operationalized mental health comorbidity on the basis of scores on self-report measures as opposed to structured diagnostic interview. Although the bulk of research on depression and pain following occupational injury has been conducted using self-report measures, the diagnostic interview is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of mental health disorders. Greater confidence in advocating RTBA interventions for the treatment of work disability associated with comorbid pain and depression awaits the results of a randomized controlled trial.\nIt is also important to consider that the study sample might differ from the population of claimants of injury or disability insurers. Claimants of injury or disability insurers would not be considered \u201cvolunteers.\u201d Individuals who volunteer to enroll in a treatment program aimed at fostering occupational re-engagement might present with a higher degree of motivation and engagement than the typical claimant of an injury or disability insurer. This limitation however is not unique to the present study but is relevant to the interpretation and generalizability of all clinical trials using volunteers as participants.\nParticipants in the present study were offered financial compensation for the involvement in the intervention program. Financial compensation was offered to incentivise participation. While financial compensation for treatment participation would not be characteristic of the conditions under which treatment is typically offered, it is necessary to consider that treatment participation for individuals who are work-disabled due to a musculoskeletal problem is most often incentivized. Treatment referrals for problems contributing to work disability are typically initiated and funded by injury insurers. Included in most injury insurance policies is a\nclause that requires the claimant to engage in treatment aimed at mitigating losses; failure to do so, particularly when the referral is initiated by the injury insurer, can have adverse claim consequences. Without some mechanism to incentivize participation, few individuals would be enrolling in disability reduction interventions.\nAlthough comorbid pain and depression is considered a very costly health and disability problem, when viewed from a population perspective, work-disabled individuals with comorbid pain and depression are distributed over a wide geographical area. If RTBA was to be considered as a treatment option to managing disability associated with comorbid pain and depression, it would be necessary to develop a plan to disseminate the required skill set to rehabilitation professionals on a region-wide basis. There would be both logistic and financial barriers that would need to be overcome. Mobilizing the resources necessary to train a large and geographically representative group of rehabilitation professionals in the skill set necessary to deliver an RTBA intervention would not be trivial. Furthermore, private sector rehabilitation professionals might not be enthusiastic about relinquishing 2 days of revenue to attend a clinical training workshop that might yield only modest increases in referrals.\nOne possible solution to this implementation challenge might be establishment of tele-health service delivery units specializing in the delivery of RTBA. Tele-health service delivery would have the advantage of wide geographical reach while requiring a minimal number of trained professionals. The low overhead costs of tele-health service delivery would also keep treatment costs at a minimum. A tele-health service delivery model would also reduce the number of clients who could not enroll or complete the intervention due to accessibility problems. An important future study would be to conduct a clinical trial of the effectiveness of the tele-health delivery of an RTBA intervention.\nTo summarize, the results of the present study provide preliminary evidence for the acceptability and effectiveness of RTBA as an approach to promoting successful occupational re-engagement in individuals with comorbid pain and depression. The findings further suggest that treatment-related reductions in catastrophic thinking and perceived injustice might be important contributors to successful occupational re-engagement in individuals with comorbid pain and depression. Return-to-work outcomes of individuals with comorbid pain and depression might be enhanced by combining symptom management interventions with interventions specifically designed to reduce catastrophic thinking and perceptions of injustice. The findings warrant proceeding to a randomized clinical trial\nto assess the efficacy of RTBA as an approach to fostering occupational re-engagement in work-disabled individuals with comorbid pain and depression.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank Monique Gagnon and Frederic Chappe for their assistance in data collection and database management.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions Conceptualization: M.J.L.
