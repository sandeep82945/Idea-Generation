Regional Comparative Studies on Financing Constraints: Considering the paper highlights differences in the impact of financing constraints on enterprise performance growth across different regions in China, future research could focus on a comparative study of financing constraints and their effects on logistics enterprises in various countries or regions. This research could explore how different economic policies, market structures, and levels of economic development influence financing constraints and enterprise performance growth in the logistics sector.

Sector-specific Analysis Beyond Logistics: While the paper focuses on the logistics industry, future research could expand the scope to investigate financing constraints and their impacts across different sectors. This could include technology, manufacturing, and service industries, comparing and contrasting the effects of financing constraints on corporate performance growth. This broader analysis could help identify unique challenges and opportunities for easing financing constraints across sectors.

Longitudinal Studies on the Evolution of Financing Constraints: The paper provides a snapshot analysis of financing constraints over a decade. Future research could adopt a longitudinal approach, examining how financing constraints and their impact on corporate performance evolve over longer periods. This would be particularly relevant in light of ongoing economic reforms, technological advancements, and changes in global financial markets.

Impact of Digital Finance on Financing Constraints: With the rapid growth of digital finance, future research could explore how digital financial services, including fintech and blockchain technologies, are impacting financing constraints for logistics enterprises and other sectors. This research could investigate whether digital finance offers a viable solution to easing financing constraints and how it influences corporate performance growth.

Policy Effectiveness and Recommendations: Building on the findings regarding the impact of knowledge stock and financing constraints on enterprise performance, future research could critically evaluate the effectiveness of current policies aimed at easing financing constraints. This research could offer recommendations for policy adjustments or new initiatives based on empirical evidence. It could also explore the role of public-private partnerships in supporting logistics enterprises' access to finance.
