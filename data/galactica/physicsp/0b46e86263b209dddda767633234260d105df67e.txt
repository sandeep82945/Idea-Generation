Eight rifamycin-related polyketides were isolated from the culture broth of a marinederived bacterium Salinispora arenicola, including five known (2–5 and 8) and three new derivatives (1, 6, and 7). The structures of the new compounds were determined by means of spectroscopic methods (HRESIMS and 1D, 2D NMR) and a comparison of their experimental data with those previously reported in the literature. The isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against one normal, six solid, and seven blood cancer cell lines and 1 showed moderate activity against all the tested cell lines with GI50 values ranging from 2.36 to 9.96 μM. 1. conclusions In conclusion, we have isolated eight rifamycin-related polyketides from the marinederived actinomycetal strain Salinispora arenicola 225DD-027, including three new compounds (1, 6, and 7). The gross structures of the new compounds were elucidated by detailed analysis of their spectroscopic data (HRESIMS, 1D, and 2D NMR). Their absolute configuration was established by consideration of their biosynthetic relationship and comparison of their NMR chemical shifts, 1H-1H coupling constants, and ECD spectra with those of the co-isolated derivatives. The new compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against one normal, six solid, and seven blood cancer cell lines, and 1 displayed moderate cytotoxicity against all the tested cancer cell lines with GI50 ranging from 2.36 to 9.96 µM. The findings of this report have enriched the biological and chemical diversities of naturally occurring polyketides from the genus Salinispora.
