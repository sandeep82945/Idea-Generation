    "abstractText": "Devices with sensing-memory-computing capability for the detection, recognition and memorization of real time sensory information could simplify data conversion, transmission, storage, and operations between different blocks in conventional chips, which are invaluable and sought-after to offer critical benefits of accomplishing diverse functions, simple design, and efficient computing simultaneously in the internet of things (IOT) era. Here, wedevelop a self-powered vertical tribo-transistor (VTT) based on MXenes for multisensing-memory-computing function and multi-task emotion recognition, which integrates triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and transistor in a single device with the simple configuration of vertical organic field effect transistor (VOFET). The tribo-potential is found to be able to tune ionic migration in insulating layer and Schottky barrier height at the MXene/semiconductor interface, and thus modulate the conductive channel between MXene and drain electrode. Meanwhile, the sensing sensitivity can be significantly improved by 711 times over the single TENG device, and the VTT exhibits excellent multi-sensing-memory-computing function. Importantly, based on this function, the multi-sensing integration and multi-model emotion recognition are constructed, which improves the emotion recognition accuracy up to 94.05% with reliability. This simple structure and self-powered VTT device exhibits high sensitivity, high efficiency and high accuracy, which provides application prospects in future human-mechanical interaction, IOT and highlevel intelligence.",

Here, wedevelop a self-powered vertical tribo-transistor (VTT) based on MXenes for multisensing-memory-computing function and multi-task emotion recognition, which integrates triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and transistor in a single device with the simple configuration of vertical organic field effect transistor (VOFET). The tribo-potential is found to be able to tune ionic migration in insulating layer and Schottky barrier height at the MXene/semiconductor interface, and thus modulate the conductive channel between MXene and drain electrode. Meanwhile, the sensing sensitivity can be significantly improved by 711 times over the single TENG device, and the VTT exhibits excellent multi-sensing-memory-computing function. Importantly, based on this function, the multi-sensing integration and multi-model emotion recognition are constructed, which improves the emotion recognition accuracy up to 94.05% with reliability. This simple structure and self-powered VTT device exhibits high sensitivity, high efficiency and high accuracy, which provides application prospects in future human-mechanical interaction, IOT and highlevel intelligence.\nWith the upsurge of artificial intelligence applications and the rapid development of internet of things (IOT), the time-efficient sensing information acquisition, energy-efficient data memorizing and processing capabilities of terminal electronic systems are indispensable1. However, in conventional chips, the separated sensing, storage, and processing units always need to collect signals by external sensors, convert signals intodigital format data subsequently, and then transfer the date to memory units and processors for subsequent processing tasks, which limits the data conversion and movement and results in low computing efficiency and huge power consumption2.

Thus, SMC systems that can integrate and organize various sensory information (multi-sensing-memorycomputing (MSMC)) are fundamental to effective perception and cognitive function1,4,11,17\u201320. Noticeably, MSMC system desires various numbers of sensory receptors and processing nodes (tactile, auditory, and visual, etc) to keep producing multi-sensing raw data and processing different types of sensory information, respectively15,21\u201328. However, the increased number of receptors slows down the working speed due to the subsequent data transmission and processing, and the separated sensory receptors and processing nodes also lead to transmission speed discrepancy, which would further limit the conversion speed and increase energy consumption24\u201326. Therefore, developing a single device integrated with the function of MSMC is of great significance to address the above-mentioned challenges and improve sensory perceptual efficiency in current electronic devices.\nNoticeably, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is energy harvesting device that can convert various forms of energy such as human motion, sound vibration, and light energy into electric power29\u201336. The native advantages of TENG render it a promising power supply device as well as a multisensory receptor33,37\u201342. Meanwhile, vertical organic field effect transistors (VOFETs) composed of vertically stacked gate/ source/drain electrodes and promising short channel possess small subthreshold swing (SS), high working frequency, and promising mechanical stability, ensuring their great practical applications in memory and computing devices43\u201346. Thus, the inherent vertically stacked electrodes of VOFETs are suitable to integrate with TENG, which possibly provides an effective approach for achieving multifunctional all-in-one-devicewith sensing-memory-computing function.\nHence, in this work, we develop a vertical tribo-transistor (VTT) device based on TENG and VOFET to implement the multi-sensingmemory-computing function and the interaction of multisensory integration. This VTT is based on a simple configuration of VOFET without any redundant layers, and MXenes function as the top electrode of TENG, source electrode of transistor, and the light collection layer of multisensory, simultaneously. The VTT allows electrostatic induction and tribo-potential to tune ionic migration and Schottky barrier, and thus the triboelectrification sensory information can be amplified to the source-drain current in a self-energy transducing manner, which improves the sensitivity by 711 times over a single TENG. Meanwhile, processing functions of different sensory perception and multisensory interaction in brain superior colliculus are achieved based on the individual VTT device. Furthermore, artificial conscious response is generated by the integration of robot hand with VTT device, and the open angle of robot hand is successfully controlled with different sensory stimulation, demonstrating that this system can straightforward enhance the accuracy of relevant event. Finally, a multi-model emotion recognition system is constructed to detect and distinguish typical mood. The self-powered VTT device shows great potential in next-generation high-performance in-sensormemory-computing artificial intelligent system and human-computer interaction interface applications."

            "text": "Self-powered vertical tribo-transistor with multi-sensing function A schematic diagram of biological multisensory integration nervous system is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The system is composed of several\nsensing units for perception, transmission pathways for transfer information, and brain for memory and computing. Here, a vertical tribo-transistor (VTT) device based on TENG (Fig. 1b) and VOFET (Fig. 1c) is fabricated to implement the multi-sensing-memorycomputing function, as illustrated in Fig. 1d. Clearly, this VTT integrates the function of a TENG and a VOFET. It is based on a VOFET configuration without any redundant layer, which is attributed to the fact that both TENG device and VOFET device share the vertical structure. The VTT composes removable Kapton substrate, removable Au gate electrode, ion-gel insulating layer, MXenes network source electrode, PDVT-10 channel layer, and Au source/drain electrode. Meanwhile, the detailed fabrication process of VTT is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, and the cross-section SEM is depicted in Supplementary Figure 2. Noticeably, MXenes, which possess regulated work function, outstanding mechanical and optical properties, have raises significant interest for optoelectronic, energy storage and Schottkybarrier based devices. Thus, MXenes are promising alternative electrode of TENG and network source electrode of VTT here. The sensing abilities, touchandhearing perception are emulatedbymoving of gate electrode and vibration of VTT, respectively, and the visual perception is achieved by the light-sensitive Ti3C2Tx MXenes electrode.\nThe scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of MXenes network is presented in Fig. 1e, which clearly shows that the MXenes are interconnected with each other and form a network structure. Meanwhile, the transmission electronmicroscope (TEM) ofMXenes is shown in Fig. 1f, whereMxenes exhibit nanosheets structure, and the thickness of MXenes network source electrode is about 1 nm. Fig 1g shows the high-resolution TEM image, and the corresponding lattice spacing in this layer is 0.3 nm45. The electrostatic induction and triboelectrification between gate electrode and insulating layer would induce the electrode-double-layer effects, which manifests in a transient channel current, thus realizing the multi-sensing-memory-computing function.\nWe first investigated the sensing function of this VTT device, and the equivalent circuit of VTT is demonstrated in Fig. 2a. The gate electrode in Fig. 2a can bemoved, and the distance between gate electrode and insulating layer is defined as d. Compared with traditional plane transistor integrated with TENG (Supplementary Fig. 3a, 3b), this VTT not only enhances the device integration level, but also simplifies the equivalent circuit (Supplementary Fig. 3). Clearly, VTT can achieve the function of TENGby only leading out the gate and source electrode, while if external voltage is applied to the source-drain electrodes, it can function as VOFET. The output performance of individual TENG is shown in Fig. 2b. With the increase of the distance between gate electrode and insulating layer from 0 to 1000 \u03bcm, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) increases from 0 to 1.71 V. The working mechanism of TENG is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 4. Here, ion-gel is employed as the triboelectric material in TENG. The Au electrode andMXenes electrode are employed as the bottom electrode and top electrode in TENG, respectively. When the distance between bottom electrode and triboelectric layer changes, and the confined charges in ion-gel attract the counterions. In theoriginal state, thebottomelectrode and ion-gel layer are not in contact with each other, and then when bottom electrode is fully contactedwith ion-gel layer (IL), electrons flow to the IL because of the triboelectric effect.When bottomelectrode ismoved away, positive and negative ions in the IL accumulate at the air/ion-gel and ion-gel/top electrode interfaces, respectively, forming an electrical double layer (EDL). Accordingly, an output voltage is recorded with the electrons flowing from top electrode to bottom electrode. It is noteworthy that the high capacitance of EDL can remarkably improve the performance of TENG (as illustrated in Supplementary Note 1)37,45,46.\nThen, we investigated the property of the devices as a VOFET. The typical transfer curve of VOFET is illustrated in Fig. 2c, where gate voltage is modulated through external voltage, and the gate electrode is contacted with the insulating layer (Supplementary Fig. 5). From the transfer characteristics of VOFET43, the subthreshold swing (SS) of\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7917 2\n91.8mV/dec is extracted, while lower SS would result in higher \u0394I (IDS1-IDS2) at same\u0394V (VGS1-VGS2), which shows the greatpotential of the device in achieving high sensitivity sensory perception. Noticeably, the VOC of TENG can be considered as a gate-source voltage and then convert into a transient channel current. Figure 2d and Fig. 2e show the transfer and output curve of VTT under different VOC from TENG, respectively.When the distance between gate electrode and insulating layer increases from 0 to 1000\u03bcm (Fig. 2d), the VTT exhibits p-type transistor behavior, and the drain-source current (IDS) increases by nearly 4 orders. Moreover, the on-state current density is greater than 5mA/cm2 (Fig. 2e), providing sufficient current density to drive organic electronic devices. This high output current density of VTT is mainly ascribed to its ultrashort channel length. For comparison, the transfer curve of planar transistor is depicted in Fig. 2c left, which shows a higher SS compared with vertical transistor. Furthermore, we investigated the sensitivity of these two devices individually when they are used for mimicking different sensory perception. Fig 2f, g show the tactile sensitivity of an individual TENG and VTT, respectively. The tactile sensitivity of TENG is defined as equ. 1: S = \u00f0\u0394V=Vmin\u00de=\u0394d \u00f01\u00de where \u0394V is the change of open-circuit Voc (V-V0), Vmin is the minimum Voc, and \u0394d is the changed distance (d) between gate electrode and insulating layer. When d is increased from 0\u03bcm to 450\u03bcm, the sensitivity is calculated tobe0.0334\u03bcm\u22121, and then a lower sensitivity of 0.0038\u03bcm\u22121 is estimated when the d increases from 450\u03bcm to 1000\u03bcm. In comparison, the tactile sensitivity of VTT is defined as eq. 2:\nS = \u00f0\u0394I=Imin\u00de=\u0394d \u00f02\u00de\nwork source electrode.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7917 3\nwhere \u0394I is the change of drain-source current \u0394IDS (I-I0), Imin is the minimum Isc, and \u0394d is the changed distance (d) between gate electrode and insulating layer. As depicted in Fig. 2g, the VTT initially exhibits a sensitivity of 2.2059\u03bcm\u22121, and then, when the d is increased from 75\u03bcm to 400\u03bcm, the sensitivity (S2) is calculated to be 23.7503\u03bcm\u22121, which is 711 times higher than that of the individual TENG. Finally, with the d exceeding 400\u03bcm,which corresponds with a saturated IDS and a lower \u0394I, a rapid decrease of the sensitivity to 1.1648\u03bcm\u22121 is observed. Thus, different distance between gate electrode and insulating layer would result in different charge distribution, Voc, IDS, and sensitivity.\nBesides, we characterized the auditory and visual stimuli transduction sensitivity of individual TENG and VTT, respectively. For the auditory stimuli transduction sensitivity, a loudspeaker with tunable soundpressure level (SPL) and frequency is usedas the acoustic source to trigger the VTT. The auditory sensitivity is defined as eq. 3:\nS = \u00f0\u0394V\u00f0\u0394I\u00de=Vmin\u00f0Imin\u00de\u00de=\u0394SPL \u00f03\u00de\nwhere\u0394SPL is the changed sound pressure level of the loudspeaker. As the sound pressure level increases from 40 to 90dB, the individual TENG device exhibits a nearly linear response and a SPL sensitivity of 0.0098 dB\u22121 (Fig. 2h).Meanwhile, the dependence of sensitivity of VTT\non SPL is shown in Fig. 2i, and the highest sensitivity is 0.6524 dB\u22121 in the range from60 to 80 dB. Furthermore, the absorbance ofMXenes is presented in Supplementary Fig. 6, which exhibits particularly high absorption intensity in ultraviolet (UV) region, and the wavelength light source used is 325 nm next. The photosensitive MXenes function as the top electrode of TENG, source electrode of transistor, and the light collection layer of multisensory, simultaneously, and the visual sensitivity of individualTENGandVTTare illustrated in Supplementary\nFig. 7. Clearly, VTT exhibits higher sensitivity than the individual TENG for each sensory perception, and the higher sensitivity of VTT is attributed to the amplification, low SS and high on/off ratio of VOFET. Moreover, the function of each material/layer in VTT with different sensing is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8, which further indicates that this VTT is beneficial to achieve multi-sensing function.\nThe working mechanism of self-powered vertical tribotransistor (VTT) Based on the above results, the working mechanism of VTT unit for tactile signal is illustrated in Fig. 3. In the initial state, the gate electrode is separatedwith the IL, and then theVTT is set to theoriginal state (the process was depicted Supplementary Fig. 9). As the gate electrode is fully contacted with IL, positive charges and negative charges accumulated on the surface of gate electrode and IL interface because of\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7917 4\nthe electrostatic induction and triboelectrification, respectively, as depict in Fig. 3a. Noticeably, the identical positive charges and negative charges lead to the off state of VTT, and there is no current recorded when a source-drain voltage is applied. The corresponding band diagram of this state is illustrates in Fig. 3b. It is clear that energy band bending would occur at MXenes/PDVT-10 interface when MXenes come into contact with PDVT-10 semiconductor. The high Schottky barrier height between theMXenes andPDVT-10 causes small source-drain current. Next, when the gate electrode and IL are separated, the tribo-potential would regulate the ionic migration of ion-gel layer, and positive ions in the IL are induced based on the charge balance effect (Fig. 3c). Simultaneously, an EDL is gradually generated at the IL, where the number of negative ions balanced the positive charges. Accordingly, temporary holes are accumulated near IL/PDVT10 interface, which would decrease Schottky barrier height between the IL and PDVT-10, and then a conductive channel from MXene to drain electrode is formed (Fig. 3d). Finally, when gate electrode and IL are further separated, the EDL is entirely generated at the IL becauseof the tribo-potential, as shown in Fig. 3e. At this stage, massive holes accumulate at the IL/PDVT-10 interface, and thus the width of the Schottky barrier between the HOMO energy level of PDVT-10 and MXenes work function is narrowed, as shown in Fig. 3f, which enables the holes to easily flow into the semiconductor layer. Thus, holes are injected into PDVT-10 semiconductor from MXenes-network source electrode under the source/drain voltage and then are vertically transferred fromPDVT-10 channel layer to drain electrode, resulting in the formation of drain-source current (on state). To further understand the working mechanism and charge transport in VTT, a 2D cross-section simulation model is exploited to demonstrate the electrical field distributions and electrical potential during the aforementioned three states, as depicted in Fig. 3g\u2013l. Notably, the drain-source current of VTT is dependent on the distance between gate electrode and IL, and different distances would result in different gate voltage. Thus, the structure of VTT in COMSOL Multiphysics is simply considered as a typical VOFET with varied gate voltage, as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 10. Figure 3g\u2013i show the\nFig. 3 | Theworkingmechanismofmulti-sensing VTTunit. aCharge distribution of the source/channel/drain layers when gate is in contact with the IL layer. bCorresponding band diagramof each layer at contact state. cCharge distribution of the source/channel/drain layers when gate is separated from the IL layer. d Corresponding band diagram of the source/channel/drain layers when gate is\nseparated from the IL layer. e Charge distribution of each layer at separation state. f Corresponding band diagram of each layer at separation state. g\u2013i The electrical field distributions of VTT under three different states. j\u2013l Potential distribution at MXenes electrode.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7917 5\nelectrical field distributions of VTT under three different states, which indicates that the distance between gate electrode and IL could effectively control the charge behavior at the IL/PDVT-10 interface. Furthermore, Fig. 3j\u2013l show the 1D potential distribution of MXenes electrode position (Supplementary Fig. 10). It is observed that the potential becomesmore negative as the distance increased, indicating stronger band-bending at the Mxene/semiconductor interface, which is favorable for the injection of holes into the PDVT-10 channel. Moreover, the working mechanism of acoustic signal into electrical signal is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S11.\nSelf-powered vertical tribo-transistor with multi-sensingmemory function Furthermore, the multi-sensing-memory function of our VTT is demonstrated. Note that EDL effect is generated at ion-gel layer, which is accompanied with retentive effects and the ion transport in EDL, resulting in synaptic behaviors of VTT. In our sensing-memorycomputing system, the sensory transduction process can be regarded as the presynaptic process, and the memory-computing process can be regarded as the postsynaptic process, as depicts in Fig. 4a. We first study the synaptic plasticity of the VTT with different tactile, auditory, and visual input signals. Fig 4b, c show the tactile responseof this VTT, where the gate voltage is controlled by the distance between gate electrode and IL, and the drain-source voltage is fixed at a constant value of \u22120.5 V. With the distance increased from 25\u03bcm to 250\u03bcm, the equivalent gate voltage is increased from 0.5 V to 1.5 V, and the post-synaptic current amplitude of IDS is augmented from 0.1\u03bcA to 8\u03bcA, as shown in Fig. 4b. Meanwhile, the EPSC peak as a function of pulse time with a fixed distance of 25\u03bcm is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 12. The EPSC firstly shows a linear enhancement when the pulse time is below 300ms and then becomes saturated when the pulse time increases from 300ms to 1000ms. Supplementary Fig. 13 shows the responding time and decay time of the tactile EPSC, and the responding time is increased from 5ms to 40ms with the distance increased from 25\u03bcm to 250\u03bcm. Clearly, larger distance will result in longer time of gate electrode and ion-gel insulating layer to contact with each other and then induce more ions and carries. Moreover, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) is also presented in SupplementaryFig. 14. As the interval timeof two continuouspluses is shorter than the ion transfer time, an obvious increase of the second EPSC amplitude can be observed. Thus, we further investigated the EPSC amplitude under different pulse frequencies. As illustrated in Fig. 4c, with the frequency changed from 1Hz to 10Hz, Imax/Imin (Imax is the 10th EPSC amplitude, Imin is the 1st EPSC amplitude) increases from 1.2 to 40, which is critical for future neuromorphic computing such as dynamic high-pass filter. Additionally, for the auditory response, the EPSCs of the VTTwith a sound pressure level ranging from 40dB to 80 dB are shown in\nFig. 4 | Synapse response of tactile, auditory, and visual. a The sensory transduction and memory-computing process. The tactile response of our VTT: b The EPSC with different distance and c Imax/Imin with different pulse frequencies. The error bar in cmeans the value of Imax/Imin within ten cycles.

When the auditory pulse (100ms) is applied to VTT, the EPSC rapidly reaches a peak value and then gradually decays to resting current. Meanwhile, the magnitude of EPSC increases from 0.5 \u03bcA to 3.2\u03bcA when the sound pressure level increases from 40dB to 80 dB, and the responding time and decay time of EPSC is also increased with the sound pressure level increased (Supplementary Fig. 12). Moreover, the effect of different sound frequencies (100ms) on the EPSCs of the VTT is depicted in Fig. 4e. The EPSC amplitudes first increases and then decreases with the frequencies ranging from 500Hz to 3000Hz, and the EPSC reaches its peak at the frequency of 1000Hz. Fig 4f shows the Voc of TENG, transferred pre-synaptic voltage, and corresponding post-synaptic current is driven by two different voice signals. Clearly, different voice signals can be distinguished with different postsynaptic currents.\nFurthermore, the visual response of VTT is illustrated in Fig. 4hg. The temporal response of normalized EPSCs as function of light intensity is demonstrated in Fig. 4h, and the inset shows a typical EPSC response with the intensity of 0.1mW/cm2. The amplitudes of EPSC increase almost linearly within a small light intensity range below 0.1mW/cm2, and then a saturated EPSC would be recorded with further increase of the light intensity. Meanwhile, the responding time and decay time are also shown in Supplementary Fig. 12. The working mechanism of VTT under light is shown in Supplementary Fig. 15.\nFigure 4g illustrates the application of two successive light pulses with different interval time (5 s, 1 s, and 0.5 s), where the second EPSC peak increases with the decreases of the interval time. The increased EPSC value after the first light pulse and the second (consecutive) light pulse are denoted as EPSC1 and EPSC2, respectively. Supplementary Fig. 16 depicts the ratio of EPSC2/ EPSC1 as a function of interval time, which is an indicator of enhancement of synaptic connections. The increased ratio suggests that the ion transport-mitigating layer contribute notably to maintain synaptic connections. Furthermore, VTT shows high endurance and stability with several cycles and days, respectively, as shows in Supplementary Fig. 17. These multi-sensing synaptic functions of our VTT lay foundation for realizing artificial intelligence system with sensing-memory-computing ability.\nSelf-powered vertical tribo-transistor with multi-sensingmemory-computing (MSMC) function Importantly, the function of MSMC in the human brain can associate and learn crossmodal information. Inspired by this fact, we then investigated the MSMC function of our VTT device. Figure 5a depicts the traditional digit MSMC system, which contains several components, such as the signal acquisition part (receptors), the power supply part, the preliminary processing parts, and the processing unit. However, the separated analog-digital hybrid circuit, memory, computing,\nFig. 5 | Multi-sensing-memory-computing model and mimicking superior colliculus. a External stimuli of our environment and traditional sensing-memorycomputing block, which consists of power supply unit, receptor unit, preliminary processing unit, and processing unit. b Equivalent multi-sensing-memorycomputing of our VTT and corresponding cross-correlation functions between single sensing-memory-computing and multi-sensing-memory-computing. c EPSC\nwith different stimuli, which can bewell-fitted by cross-correlation functions.d The change of A and B with increased external sensing pulses (single voice pulses, and light pulses; or voice+light pulses). e Single sensory stimuli and multisensory stimuli with different sensory strength.

Our self-powered VTTdevice is illustrated in Fig. 5b, the TENG component in VTT is regarded as the sensor of the MSMC system, and VTT is regarded as the preliminary and processing unit. Since the working mechanism of VTT under mechanical and optical stimuli is different, such device is attractive for processing multi-sensing information without an extra preliminary processing unit. Here, the output current (IDS) of VTT is depicted as IDS = A\u00d7IDS1 + B\u00d7IDS2 +\u2026 +N\u00d7IDSn, where IDS1, IDS2, and IDSn are the EPSC with different external stimuli (visual, auditory, tactile, etc.). Meanwhile, the expression of IDS is depicted as eq. (4):\nF\u00f0x,y, . . . z\u00de=A\u00d7h\u00f0x\u00de+B\u00d7g\u00f0y\u00de+ . . . +N\u00d7w\u00f0z\u00de \u00f04\u00de\nwhere h (x), g (x), and w (z) are IDS1, IDS2, and IDSn of VTT, respectively, A, B, and N are constants. For example, as shown in Fig. 5c, the EPSC of VTT under auditory stimuli is fitted as h(x) = \u22126.5 \u00d7 exp \u00d7 (\u2212x/65.9) + 4.9, and the EPSC of VTT under optical stimuli is fitted as g(y) = \u22126.5 \u00d7 exp \u00d7 (\u2212y/32.5) + 5.4. Based on the change of EPSC amplitude, the response under auditory and optical stimuli simultaneously can be fitted as F (x,y) = A \u00d7 h (x) + B \u00d7 g (y). Noticeably, with the increases of stimuli pluses, the constant of A decreases, while B increases, as illustrated in Fig. 5d. We further investigate the MSMC function of VTT with tactile and visual response simultaneously, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 18. This phenomenon further demonstrates that our artificial multisensory device with the MSMC function could facilitate the parallel processing of large amounts of external stimuli information, which decreases the data exchange between storage and computation, increases working speed, and decreases power consumption compared with traditional CMOS architecture.\nFurthermore, considering that multisensory integration is a critical and ongoing determinant of human behavior. Noticeably, inputs from different sensory neurons are converged on cells in the superior colliculus, and then result in multisensory integration. Here, we mimicked the response of superior colliculus in the human brain upon the approaching of a dog to demonstrate themultisensory integration (as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 19). As the dog became closer, the individual information (visual and auditory) shows higher impulses, while VA responses became proportionately weaker (Fig. 5e). In addition, the change between single sensory and multi-sensory is defined as VA/(Vmax, Amax)\u00d7100% (%change). Clearly, the %change is enhanced with the dog being closer, as illustrated in Fig. 5f. The neural computation involved in their integration is changed from superadditive to additive and then to subadditive, and the detailed illustrations are provided in Supplementary Note 2. Moreover, as multisensory integration could enhance the single sensory signal and thebehaviors thatdependon them,we further constructed anartificial stimulus-response system to further prove the multisensory enhancement concept. The robot hand system supported by our VTT is also illustrated in Supplementary Note 3.\nSelf-powered vertical tribo-transistor with MSMC function for multi-mode emotion recognition All of the above characterizations and analyses imply that our VTT exhibits excellentMSMC function in a single device. Thus, basedon the MSMC function, we construct a multi-model emotion recognition system to further demonstrate the capability of VTT in extending artificial intelligent boundary. Noticeably, the emotion is tightly entangled with behavior of human, while the complete emotion information cannot be obtained only through visual or auditory perception. Thus, combining the characteristic information and extracted feature information from the two perceptions would improve the emotion recognition accuracy and reliability. As depicts in Fig. 6, through single VTT device, we achieve the multi-model emotion recognition. Noticeably, the effective features are extracted from\nvisual and auditory mode by our devices (the EPSC with different light intensity is been separated into 16 states, and each state corresponds to 16 numerical values of colorful images, as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 22), and then the information is transferred to input layer for further processing, as indicates in Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 23. Here, the select fusion model is data-level fusion, which directly combines themost original data collect by our devices without special processing to construct a group of new data. Then the several basic discrete emotions, such as sadness, fear, disgust, surprise, excitement and anger can be recognized by operation methods to compute and process data from multiple data sources.\nWe first demonstrate themotion recognition accuracy with visual model, auditory model, and multi-model, respectively, as illustrates in Figs. 6b\u2013f. Several images are selected from a video without sound information, sound wave, or visual information, and the recognition accuracyof six emotions is summarized at Figs. 6c, e, and 6f. Note that, the accuracy of multi-model emotion recognition is significantly higher than that of a single model, which further indicates that our multi-model emotion recognition system is suitable for recognizing the complex emotional category through a certain combinationmode. Thus, the comparison of recognition accuracy between different models is further shown in Fig. 6g. Clearly, the visual + auditorymodel exhibits the highest recognition accuracy of 94.05% after 140 epochs, while the accuracy of other single models is lower than that of the multi-model system. Moreover, the accuracy is higher than the values reported in previous works as illustrates in Table 1. These results apparently demonstrate that MSMC VTT device can well retain the data information on each modal sensor to avoid the loss of information, maintain the integrity of information, and significantly enhance the certainty of emotion.\nFinally, the superiority of our self-powered multi-sensingmemory-computing device is concluded. (i) simple structure and self-powered device: the receptors and synapses are integrated in a single device based on a simple configuration of VOFET without any redundant layers, which enhances packing density, simplifies fabrication procedures and reduces chip cost, and further decreases power consumptionwith the self-power function of TENG. (ii) high sensitivity: The amplification, low SS (91.8mV/dec) and high current density (5mA/cm2) of VTT ensure high sensing sensitivity (the tactile sensitivity improves 711 times over individual TENG). (iii) high efficiency and conversion speed: themulti-sensing-memory-computing function and the interaction of multifunction integration of our VTT increases the conversion speed, which is associated with the decreased physical separation between sensory receptors andprocessednodes compared with the traditional CMOS architecture. (iv) high recognition accuracy: the multi-model emotion recognition is successfully achieved based on the multi-sensing-memory-computing ability of our VTT, which significantly improves the computing functionality, recognition variety and accuracy."
