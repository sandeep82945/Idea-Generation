As an example realizing such a possibility we consider a model of the massless tensor field l\u03bc\u03bd(x) in a 4-dim. background g\u03bc\u03bd(x) with spontaneously broken Weyl and scale symmetries. It is shown that the potential of l\u03bc\u03bd , represented by a scalar quartic polynomial, has the degenerate extremal described by the composite Nambu\u2013 Goldstone scalar boson \u03c6(x) := gl\u03bc\u03bd . Removal of the degeneracy shows that \u03c6 acquires a non-zero vev \u3008\u03c6\u30090 = \u03bc which, together with the free parameters of the potential, defines the cosmological constant. The latter is zero for a certain choice of the parameters. Our universe expands and this process has two certain periods. The inflation period was very short and lasted from 10\u221236 to 10\u221232 s after the Big Bang [1\u20134]. The period of accelerated expansion began eight billion years later and is continuing on now. Both are conjectured as caused by hypothetic quantum fields with special properties of their vacua. Inflation posits inflaton \u2013 a scalar field with the specific shape of its potential which provides a non-zero vacuum expectation value for inflaton. At the end of the slow-rolling regime inflaton reaches the bottom of its potential. This evolution picture matches the exponentially expanding de Sitter universe and the Standard Model [5], ([6] and refs. there). The assumed slow-rolling constraint requires fine-tuning of the initial data with the postulates of quantum field theory and general relativity. Although the inflation predicts and explains many observational data it is not known yet what powered it. The period of accelerated expansion is explained by the presence of dark energy which is homogeneously distributed across all space-time. In the period of early universe the effect of dark energy was negligibly small but its effect becomes dominant at very long distances [7\u201310]. Dark energy creates a e-mail: aaz@nordita.org (corresponding author) a repulsive force which dominates the attractive gravitational force of visible and dark matter responsible for decelerated expansion of the universe. It is believed that dark energy is bound up with the cosmological constant encoding vacuum energy of the space-time [11\u201313]. A hard problem here is a huge discrepancy between the experimental value of the cosmological constant and vacuum energy predicted by quantum field theory [14\u201316]. It was proposed to treat dark energy as a vacuum energy called quintessence that originated from potential energy of very light dynamical particles [17\u201319]. They are associated with a scalar field creating the fifth repulsive force that causes the accelerated expansion [20\u201322]. The latter is generally predicted to be slightly less than the one given by the cosmological constant. A special case is phantom energy which is the quintessence energy characterized by the density increasing in time. Such a case may cause the expansion that exceeds the speed of light resulting in improbable scenario in which all interactions vanish through a finite time [23]. Modified gravity models suppose alternative way which does not need to use the dark energy image [24\u201328]. It is amazing that for each of the complicated evolutional periods on different energy scales, the use of scalar fields such as inflaton or quintessence boson has been successful in getting closer to understanding of the dynamics of expanded universe. A key element in this picture seems to be connected with the conception of spontaneously broken symmetries caused by degeneration of vacua that trigger creation of the Nambu\u2013Goldstone (N\u2013G) bosons. Scalar bosons were also predicted by the Standard Model and string theory, but the Higgs boson was the only fundamental scalar field observed at the current energies of the LHC. This boson is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking. So, it was natural to identify the Higgs boson with the inflaton [29,30]. However, it soon became clear that this assumption violated the perturbative unitarity condition [31\u201333]. Attempts to overcome this problem showed [34] that the Higgs boson alone was not able",

Inflation posits inflaton \u2013 a scalar field with the specific shape of its potential which provides a non-zero vacuum expectation value for inflaton. At the end of the slow-rolling regime inflaton reaches the bottom of its potential. This evolution picture matches the exponentially expanding de Sitter universe and the Standard Model [5], ([6] and refs. there). The assumed slow-rolling constraint requires fine-tuning of the initial data with the postulates of quantum field theory and general relativity. Although the inflation predicts and explains many observational data it is not known yet what powered it.\nThe period of accelerated expansion is explained by the presence of dark energy which is homogeneously distributed across all space-time. In the period of early universe the effect of dark energy was negligibly small but its effect becomes dominant at very long distances [7\u201310]. Dark energy creates\na e-mail: aaz@nordita.org (corresponding author)\na repulsive force which dominates the attractive gravitational force of visible and dark matter responsible for decelerated expansion of the universe. It is believed that dark energy is bound up with the cosmological constant encoding vacuum energy of the space-time [11\u201313]. A hard problem here is a huge discrepancy between the experimental value of the cosmological constant and vacuum energy predicted by quantum field theory [14\u201316]. It was proposed to treat dark energy as a vacuum energy called quintessence that originated from potential energy of very light dynamical particles [17\u201319]. They are associated with a scalar field creating the fifth repulsive force that causes the accelerated expansion [20\u201322]. The latter is generally predicted to be slightly less than the one given by the cosmological constant. A special case is phantom energy which is the quintessence energy characterized by the density increasing in time. Such a case may cause the expansion that exceeds the speed of light resulting in improbable scenario in which all interactions vanish through a finite time [23]. Modified gravity models suppose alternative way which does not need to use the dark energy image [24\u201328]. It is amazing that for each of the complicated evolutional periods on different energy scales, the use of scalar fields such as inflaton or quintessence boson has been successful in getting closer to understanding of the dynamics of expanded universe. A key element in this picture seems to be connected with the conception of spontaneously broken symmetries caused by degeneration of vacua that trigger creation of the Nambu\u2013Goldstone (N\u2013G) bosons. Scalar bosons were also predicted by the Standard Model and string theory, but the Higgs boson was the only fundamental scalar field observed at the current energies of the LHC. This boson is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking. So, it was natural to identify the Higgs boson with the inflaton [29,30]. However, it soon became clear that this assumption violated the perturbative unitarity condition [31\u201333]. Attempts to overcome this problem showed [34] that the Higgs boson alone was not able\nto yield the dynamics mediated by the inflaton without adding new degrees of freedom [35]. Such scalar DOF arise in the supergravity model unifying the Volkov\u2013Akulov [36] and a chiral superfield [37]. A wider set of new DOF described by the massless chiral N = 1 D = 4 and N = 1 D = 10 multiplets (s, s + 1/2) with spins (s = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, . . .) emerges from the \u03b8 -twistor description [38\u201342]. Spontaneous breaking of the local supersymmetry points to degeneration among the extremals of the effective quartic Higgs potential in supergravity models [43]. A hierarchy between the Planck mass, cosmological constant and electroweak scale was explained by this degeneration. Detection of new DOF in accelerators and cosmic experiments on TEV scales may lead to new physics outside the SM. Scalar fields which arise in phenomenological models of systems with spontaneously broken symmetries identified with the (pseudo)N\u2013 G bosons [44\u201350]. Axion and \u03c0 -mesons give well-known examples of such bosons arising due to spontaneous breaking of the approximate U (1)axial and chiral symmetries, where \u03c0 -mesons are considered as composed byqq\u0304 pairs. This hints that scalar fields in cosmology may also have a composite structure formed by the metric field g\u03bc\u03bd(x) of a curved background and hypothetic tensor fields. The latter may originate from quark\u2013gluon plasma and have their own internal multiquark structure described a global symmetry G. Study of tensor models invariant under the group G and diffeomorphisms may help, in particular, to understand the nature of the inflaton and dark matter. On this way it\u2019s interesting to find such nonlinear interaction potentials of the tensors that would have nontrivial extremals. The latter together with the equations of motion (EOM) could indicate on the presence of spontaneous breaking of the symmetry group G. We suppose that the extremals of the potential are expressed in terms of covariant effective fields composed of the metric and tensor fields. Then the corresponding condensates of the tensor fields will encode effective modes of excitations of quark\u2013 gluon plasma. Cooling of plasma rebuilds the tensors of the previous stage due to changes of thermodynamic scales. This deforms the interaction potential and its extremals defining non-zero vev of the composite fields. If these fields appear in the form of diffeomorphism-invariant combinations of g\u03bc\u03bd and tensors, then they can be seen as composite scalars. An example which sustains the above scenario in a 4-dim. background is proposed here. For this purpose we use the known idea to treat the global scale symmetry of our universe as spontaneously broken symmetry [51\u201355]. It is in agreement with the experimental data of Planck [9] and other high precision experiments.\nIn previous known models the scale symmetry breaking is achieved by using a scalar field\u03c6 of the Brans\u2013Dicke type that is understood to represent an elementary particle with zero spin. The corresponding potential V \u221d \u03bb\u03c64 which is added in a gravity action quadratic in curvature. Here we study an\naction invariant under the global Weyl and scale symmetries that includes a symmetric massless tensor l\u03bc\u03bd instead of the scalar \u03c6. In the particle physics such a tensor is understood as an elementary particle carrying any spin from the set s = 2, 1, 0. The proposed model reveals that l\u03bc\u03bd encodes a composite scalar field carrying spin zero. It is notable that this result holds for the general polynomial potential admissible with the invariance of the action under diffeomorphisms and scale transformations.\nTherefore, the presence in the proposed model of two massless symmetric tensors l\u03bc\u03bd and g\u03bc\u03bd does not break the well known no-go theorem in the theory of gravity that forbids the presence of multiple massless particles with spins equal to 2. A hint of this result follows also from the existence of a natural geometric scalar \u03c6 = g\u03bc\u03bdl\u03bc\u03bd , where the tensor field encodes the degrees of freedom of an evolutional period of the expanding universe. The potential of l\u03bc\u03bd consistent with the symmetries of the studied action is given by the general homogenious quartic polynomial, containing a few dimensionless parameters, that generalizes the \u03bb\u03c64 potential, Study of critical points of the potential of l\u03bc\u03bd reveals its non-trivial extremal l0\u03bc\u03bd(x) = (\u03c60(x)/4)g\u03bc\u03bd , where \u03c60 = l0\u03bc\u03bdg\u03bc\u03bd . This extremal preserves all symmetries of the action and forms an infinitely degenerate vacuum manifold.1 Substitution of l0\u03bc\u03bd into the EOM for l\u03bc\u03bd shows the presence of the particular solution \u03c6o = \u03bc = constant . This solution removes infinite degeneration of the vacuum manifold described by the order parameter \u03c60(x) forming a linear representation of the Weyl and scale groups. The removal of this degeneration is realized by choosing a fixed value of the function \u03c60(x) equal to \u03c6o. This choice is interpreted as fixing the vacuum state. Pictorially this fixing is represented by using two different subscripts \u201c0\u201d and \u201co\u201d. Thereby it is realized spontaneous breakdown of the scale symmetry, where \u03c6(x) turns out to be the composite N\u2013G boson having its vev \u3008\u03c6(x)\u30090 \u2261 \u03c6o = \u03bc. The free constant \u03bc introduces the characteristic mass scale \u03bc which also defines the vev of l\u03bc\u03bd given by the formula \u3008l\u03bc\u03bd(x)\u30090 = (\u03bc/4)g\u03bc\u03bd(x).\nAt the broken vacuum state marked by \u03c6o the potential becomes a constant and we identify it with the cosmological constant. As a result, we get the opportunity to control the value of the cosmological constant by varying free dimensionless parameters of the potential. Using this possibility we find such two- and four-parametric potentials for which the cosmological constant becomes equal to zero.\nThe sections of the paper are distributed as follows. In Sect. 1 we present the action, the potential of l\u03bc\u03bd(x) in the background with a metric g\u03bc\u03bd(x) and define the action symmetries. In order not to overload the paper we restrict ourselves to the case, where g\u03bc\u03bd is considered as an external\n1 Assumption that the parameters of spontaneously symmetry breaking can be higher rank tensors was previously pointed out in [56,57].\ngravitational field. In Sect. 2 the EOM and its representation including the Riemann tensor R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b3\u03c1 of the background are derived. In Sect. 3 spontaneous emergence of the composite scalar field \u03c6(x) is detected. In Sect. 4 the non-trival extremal of the two-parametric potential is found out. It is shown that on this extremal the action reduces to the scale and diff invariant action of the massless \u03c64-theory in the background with the coupling constant equal to k 2\n2 (\u03b1\u2212\u03b2), where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are free parameters. Revealed in Sect. 5 is spontaneous breaking of the Weyl and scale symmetries resulting in the cosmological constant equal to \u03bb = \u03b1\u2212\u03b2\n32k2 \u3008\u03c6\u300940. This value\nis equal to the potential of the vacuum solution breaking the Weyl and scale symmetries. In Sect. 6 it is shown that the extremal of a four-parametric potential coincides with the found extremal of the two-parametric potential. This result shows that spontaneous breakdown of the Weyl and scale symmetries takes place for the general polynomial potential in four-dimensional gravitational backgrounds. The obtained results and further prospects are discussed in Summary."

(38)\nDue to this, l0\u03bc\u03bd turns out to be a root of Eq.

Indeed, each term in square brackets in (39) vanishes after substitution of l0\u03bc\u03bd there. So, we obtain another one-parametric potential UI I |\u03b2=0 = \u2212\u03b1 { 2\n3 [Tr(l4) \u2212 TrlT r(l3)]\n+1 4\n[ Tr(l2)(Trl)2 \u2212 1\n8 (Trl)4\n]} . (40)\nThus, we see that the two-parametric potential (29)\nUI I = \u03b2UI I |\u03b1=0 + \u03b1UI I |\u03b2=0 (41)\nhas the same extremals as UI I |\u03b1=0 and UI I |\u03b2=0.

The former extremal is a particular solution of EOM (14) and (16), but this property should be verified for l0 \u03bc\u03bd(x) to confirm the assumption made in Sect. 3. Let us note that the potential term in (47) vanishes for the case when the free parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are equal. Below this fact will be used in the proof of the vanishing of the cosmological constant under spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry."

            "text": "Studied is an attempt to understand the amazing efficiency of scalar fields such as the inflaton in describing the expanding universe. Our approach is based on the assumption about a composite structure of such scalar particles. The latters are treated as Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons, which arise as a result of spontaneous breaking of global internal or spacetime symmetries. As an example, a model of the massless symmetric tensor field l\u03bc\u03bd(x) in a 4-dim. background g\u03bc\u03bd(x) with spontaneously broken global Weyl and scale symmetries is considered. It is assumed that such type tensor fields could describe some degrees of freedom of the quark\u2013gluon plasma associated with higher spins.\nTo explain the proposed scenario, we analyze the critical points of the potential of l\u03bc\u03bd , represented by general quartic polynomial, and find a classical vacuum that points to spontaneous breaking of both the Weyl and scale symmetries. The vacuum-related extremal is characterized by the emerging composite Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson \u03c6(x) := g\u03bc\u03bdl\u03bc\u03bd which acquires a non-zero vev \u3008\u03c6\u30090 = \u03bc. The arbitrary constant \u03bc introduces a characteristic mass scale which defines the vev \u3008l\u03bc\u03bd(x)\u30090 = (\u03bc/4)g\u03bc\u03bd(x). We show that \u03bc, together with the free dimensionless parameters of the potential, defines the cosmological constant. As a result, it becomes possible to control the value of the cosmological constant by varying these free parameters. We find, in particular, that the cosmological constant vanishes for a certain choice of the free parameters. In our example the composite structure of the tensor l\u03bc\u03bd confirms the known no-go theorem which forbids the presence of multiple massless particles with spins equal to 2 in any general covariant action consistent with the perturbative unitarity condition. Nevertheless, the theorem allows the field l\u03bc\u03bd to carry spin(s) 1 and 0. However, spontaneous breaking of the global symmetries, preserving the diff-invariance of the action, demands the extremal l0\u03bc\u03bd(x) to be aligned along the external field g\u03bc\u03bd(x) similarly to the case of (anti)ferromagnetics in magnetic field. Therefore the polarization DOF of l0\u03bc\u03bd(x) are determined by the metric background tensor g\u03bc\u03bd(x). As a result, the g-trace of the extremal l0\u03bc\u03bd remains its only degree of freedom identified with the composite scalar field. This fact points to the possible distinguished role of composite massless scalar fields in the dynamics of the expanding universe.\nIt was noted in the Introduction that l\u03bc\u03bd(x) is treated as belonging to tensor modes generated by the quark\u2013gluon plasma. The scale invariant potential (2) captures the dynamics of this mode in the approximation of massless quarks\nthat results in creation of the composite N\u2013G boson \u03c6. In QCD and Standard Model a finite radius of action of forces binding quarks and gluons is taken into account by introducing the energy scale parameter QCD . The experimentally observed quark masses are expressed in terms of QCD . The pion mass, in particular, is defined by the relation m\u03c0 \u221d \u221a 2mu QCD , where mu is the mass of the light current u-quark. The relatively small mass of pion in comparison with other mesons is explained by the observation that pion is N\u2013G boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry.\nTaking into account that in our universe conformal symmetry is broken, one can try to implement a similar mechanism for understanding the emergence of mass for the discussed N\u2013G fields. To do this, note that the expression QCD = \u3008uu\u0304\u30090/ f 2\u03c0 |mu=0 contains two dimensional parameters which are the quark condensate and the pion decay constant f\u03c0 . The role of the quark condensate in our model plays \u3008\u03c6\u30090 \u2261 Trlo = \u03bc. Therefore, we need to have a new dimensional constant f encoding an effective mass of l\u03bc\u03bd . Using f allows to extend the scale invariant potential U (2) by the additional term Um quadratic in l\u03bc\u03bd\nUbroken = a f 2Tr(l2) + b 4 f 2(Trl)2 (77)\nwhich explicitly breaks the scale symmetry and contains two dimensionless parameters. On the extremal (36) Ubroken takes the form of the mass termUm for the N\u2013G boson \u03c60(x)\nUbroken \u2212\u2192 Um = (a + b) f 2\n4 \u03c620 . (78)\nThe sum of U (2) and Ubroken (77) yields an effective potential U\u2217\nU\u2217 = U +Ubroken (79) that explicitly violates the Weyl/scale symmetries but retains the memory of the N\u2013G mechanism of the appearance of the composite scalar \u03c6(x).\nAnother important generalization of the model is the construction of the kinetic term for the gravitational field. In the theory of gravity the kinetic term for g\u03bc\u03bd is given by the Hilbert-Einstein action including the scalar curvature R. In the studied model, the requirement that the action be invariant under diffeorphisms is extended to its invariance under scaling transformations. These requirements are satisfied by the terms linear in R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b3\u03c1 and quadratic in l\u03b1\u03b2 . Such terms naturally generalize the term R\u03c62 used in the previous gravitational models involving the elementary scalar \u03c6(x). These extensions of the model will be studied in more detail in a different place.\nAcknowledgements The author is grateful to NORDITA and Physics Department of Stockholm University for kind hospitality and support.
