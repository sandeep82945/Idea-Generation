    "abstractText": "Extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion is a dynamic process crucial to cellular communication. Temporally sorting EVs, i.e., separating the newly-produced ones from the pre-existing, can allow not only deep understanding of EV dynamics, but also the discovery of potential EV biomarkers that are related to disease progression or responsible to drug intervention. However, the high similarity between the nascent and pre-existing EVs makes temporal separation extremely challenging. Here, by co-translational introduction of azido groups to act as a timestamp for click chemistry labelling, we develop a microfluidic-based strategy to enable selective isolation of nascent EVs stimulated by an external cue. In two mouse models of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, we demonstrate the strategy\u2019s feasibility and reveal the high positive correlation of nascent PD-L1 EV level to tumor volume, suggesting an important role of nascent EVs in response to immunotherapy in cancer treatment.",

Temporally sorting EVs, i.e., separating the newly-produced ones from the pre-existing, can allow not only deep understanding of EV dynamics, but also the discovery of potential EV biomarkers that are related to disease progression or responsible to drug intervention. However, the high similarity between the nascent and pre-existing EVs makes temporal separation extremely challenging. Here, by co-translational introduction of azido groups to act as a timestamp for click chemistry labelling, we develop a microfluidic-based strategy to enable selective isolation of nascent EVs stimulated by an external cue. In two mouse models of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, we demonstrate the strategy\u2019s feasibility and reveal the high positive correlation of nascent PD-L1+ EV level to tumor volume, suggesting an important role of nascent EVs in response to immunotherapy in cancer treatment.\nEVs are nano-sized vesicles secreted by virtually all cells1. Their role in mediating cell-cell communication is known to be crucial in a plethora of physiological and pathological processes, making them potential biomarkers for many diseases, such as cancer, neuro-degenerative diseases, and virus infection2\u20134. Depending on the biological context, EV secretion is variable. Thus, capturing EV dynamics, including selectively sorting nascent EVs from the total, will inform us of the essential biological response to specific stimuli, which can not only deepen our understanding of EV regulatory mechanisms but also lead to the discovery of potential EV biomarkers for disease progression and treatment response5. Classical EV-separation methods, including sedimentation rate-based ultracentrifugation6, size-based microfiltration7, and affinity-based magnetic bead/microfluidic enrichment8\u201311, are mostly based on the inherent physicochemical parameters12 of EV that lack of temporal resolution, thus incapable of distinguishing nascent EVs from the pre-existing. Time-lapse has been harnessed to study EV dynamics in cultured cells13, however, it is still limited by the inability to reflect complex EV exchanging under physiological conditions, which is critical for understanding EV-mediated intercellular communication in vivo. Consequently, how the production rate andmolecular alteration of nascent EVs affect their functional outcomes as well as the metabolism of recipient cells remains an important question yet to be answered5. The challenge mainly resides in the presence of the vast majority of pre-existing EVs and the dynamic nature of de novo production of nascent EVs. Here, we develop a microfluidic-assisted enrichment strategy based onmetabolic labeling and click chemistry (Melac-Chip) to allow the selective isolation of nascent EVs stimulated by an external cue (by immunotherapy in our case, Fig. 1). During anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, we conducted in vivo metabolic glycoengineering with unnatural sugars to ubiquitously label the newly-produced EVswith azido groups (in analogy to mark letters with timestamps) to distinguish them from the pre-existing populations. Subsequent click chemistry linked the azido-labeled EVs with alkynyl biotin14, allowing them to be specifically\nReceived: 24 March 2023\nAccepted: 5 October 2023\nCheck for updates\n1State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, The MOE Key Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, P.

Taking that into consideration, we chose Ac4ManNAz, an unnatural azido-containing monosaccharide, as our MGL additive since it has been widely exploited for membrane glycoprotein labeling ex vivo and in vivo with high efficiency and biocompatibility15\u201317. Meanwhile, we selected EV isolated from cell culture media as the model vesicle system to test whether the azido groups can be efficiently incorporated into the vesicle through the labeled membrane glycoproteins. After treating human melanoma A375 cells with Ac4ManNAz, we collected the secreted A375 EVs by ultracentrifugation18\u201320, loaded themon latex beads21, and then stained them with alkyl dye (DBCO-Cy5) capable of reacting with azido groups22 (Fig. 2a). Flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 2b) and confocal imaging (Supplementary Fig. 1) displayed apparent fluorescence signals from the dye on the latex beads containing MGL EVs only (in comparison with the non-MGL control), suggesting the successful incorporation of azido groups. The detected fluorescence intensity reached the plateau at the conditions of 50\u03bcM Ac4ManNAz (60-h incubation) and 12.5\u03bcM DBCO-Cy5 (1-h incubation).\nTo assess the biocompatibility of Ac4ManNAz on EVs, we compared their physical properties and protein contents with and without MGL. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed the cupshaped structure for theMGL EVs (Fig. 2c), themeandiameter and zeta potential of which were measured to be 140 nm and -4.5mV,\nrespectively, by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 2d, e). All of these properties look alike to those from the non-MGL EVs. In addition, the labeled EVs showed high expression of CD63 (Fig. 2f), a classical panEV marker4. Further proteomics study revealed that out of 1,000 proteins, a total of 806 were shared by the MGL and non-MGL EVs (Fig. 2g). Gene ontology analysis of these proteins and their annotated biological processes (Fig. 2h), cellular components (Fig. 2i), and molecular functions (Fig. 2j), suggested highly similar protein contents for the EVswith andwithoutMGL.Moreover, using the top 30proteins as a reference, we confirmed the great reproducibility of the MGL on EV generation (a correlation of ~0.99 among three biological replicates, Fig. 2k, l). Based on all of these results, it is reasonable to conclude that Ac4ManNAz additive is biocompatible with EV production and affects little on EV morphology and proteome."

Due to the lack of azido groups, those non-MGL EVs were unable to link with the biotin modification, thus being washed away during the microchip capturing. To promote liquid-solid mass transfer, we chose herringbonemicrochip (HB-Chip) as the high-throughput microfluidic mixingdevice. Consistentwith thepreviouswork23,24, by simulation the herringbone patterned channels were able to disrupt the laminar flow profile and generate steady chaotic flows (Fig. 3b), which can enhance the collisions between EVs and the affinity interface.

The observed fluorescence intensity displayed a positively linear relationship with the MGL EV concentration (R2 = 0.98; limit of detection, LOD=9.95 ng \u00b5L-1), suggesting the quantitative capability of Melac-Chip (Fig. 3e). In addition, EVs captured byMelac-Chipmaintained a classical spherical topology (Fig. 3f), implying their well integrity. Moreover, 3D reconstructed fluorescence images indicated that only the MGL EVs (pre-stained) were captured (Fig. 3g), further highlighting the excellent selectivity of Melac-Chip. We also explored the timewindowofMelac-Chip by using it to analyze the A375 EVs collected at different time points (0-60 h) after MGL. The results showed an increased fluorescence signal over time and MGL EVs can be detected as early as in 4 h (Fig. 3h), suggesting the timeliness of MGL and high efficiency of Melac-Chip.\nMicrofluidic isolation and detection of EVs with in vivo MGL We next explored the metabolic labeling of EVs in vivo and the corresponding EV isolation and detection. We chose 4T1 breast tumorbearing mice as the model system and injected Ac4ManNAz (20 \u00b5L of 40mM Ac4ManNAz in intratumoral injection and 100 \u00b5L of 140mM\nAc4ManNAz in intraperitoneal injection) into the mice once daily for three consecutive days25,26 (PBS injection as the control, Fig. 4a). To monitor biodistribution of the azido-modified EVs, we collected the mouse samples of plasma, tumor tissue, and tissue from four major organs (heart, liver, lung and kidney). EVs in the plasma samples were directly analyzed by Melac-Chip, while EVs from tissue samples were separated by using a combination of slicing and enzyme digestion followed by differential ultracentrifugation27 (Fig. 4b), and then subjected toMelac-Chip analysis. To enable the analysis, only 5\u03bcL of each sample was required to click with DBCO-PEG4-biotin, and the analysis showed a similar phenomenon to that of the in vitro MGL, that is, the azido-labeled samples (regardless of from plasma or tissue) displayed apparent increases in the intensity of anti-CD63 staining as comparing to the PBS control (Fig. 4c), suggesting the successful MGL on EVs in vivo and the isolation capability ofMelac-Chip on the in vivo labeled EV samples. Among the quantified EV levels from the in vivo MGL model, those from the plasma and tumor tissue samples were the highest (~43-fold higher to the lowest) (Fig. 4c), indicating that during the 3-day in vivo MGL window, the labeled EVs were primarily distributedwithin the tumor and blood. Considering the high EV level and easiness to handle, we chose mouse plasma samples for subsequent experiments.\nAs the tumor-specific antibodies are integrated into Melac-Chip for EV detection, in principle the strategy could be applied for analysis\nSecondary antibody\ni.t.

To demonstrate this speculation, we tried to harness the anti-PD-L1 antibody to detect the PD-L1 positive (PD-L1+) EVs (Fig. 4d), a promising marker for tumor diagnosis20,28,29, from the total captured ones. On the basis of confirming the PD-L1 expression on 4T1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4), we firstly investigated how the administration manner affects the efficiency of EV labeling in 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. Considering both intratumoral (i. t.)26,30 and intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection25,31 are commonly used for Ac4ManNAz-based cell labeling in vivo, we gave a series of i. t. and i. p. injection to 4T1 tumor-bearing mice (once daily for three consecutive days). Among them, using Melac-Chip we identified the optimal condition to be the combination of 20 \u00b5L of 25mM Ac4ManNAz in i. t. and 100 \u00b5L of 140mM Ac4ManNAz in i. p., under which the anti-PD-L1 antibody staining intensity reached the highest, ~34-fold to that of the control group (PBS injection, Fig. 4e). Meanwhile, although PD-L1 is known to be expressed by immune cells in the plasma32, at this condition nearly negligible PD-L1+ MGL EV signal was detected in the plasma samples from normal mice (Fig. 4f), suggesting low expression of PD-L1 on EVs in normal plasma samples20,33,34 and supporting the tumor-biomarker role of PD-L1+ EVs20,29. We also studied the time window of MGL for efficient detection of these EVs with Melac-Chip. Again, we administeredAc4ManNAz (20 \u00b5Lof 25mMAc4ManNAz in i. t. and 100 \u00b5L of 140mM Ac4ManNAz in i. p.) once daily to 4T1 tumorbearingmice for up to 4 days.We collected themouse plasma samples each day starting from day 0. Melac-Chip analysis revealed the detectable signal of PD-L1+ MGL EVs on day 2 and an increase in the signal till day 3 when it seemed to be saturated (Fig. 4g). As the detected PD-L1+ MGL EV signal reached the plateau on day 3, a stop of Ac4ManNAz injection for consecutive 7 days (referring to the classical interval between two immunotherapy doses35\u201337) completely diminished the signal of this EV, suggesting the well clearance of this unnatural sugar in vivo and the well sensitivity of Melac-Chip. Together, these results demonstrate that Melac-Chip can be used to not only isolate the in vivo metabolically labeled EVs but also selectively detect tumor-derived EVs from the total isolation.\nProbing nascent EVs in response to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy Immune-checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1/PD-1 axis have shown remarkable promise in tumor treatment. However, only 10-40% of patients canderivebenefit from this immunotherapy37\u201339. Thus, to help the patients choose the right treatment and to improve the treatment efficacy, it is important to be capable of predicting patient response from the therapy. Currently, increasing evidence points to EV PD-L1 as a predictor for anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-1 therapy, since it can regulate tumor progression through inhibition of T cell activity20,28,29,40. Here, using Melac-Chip we are able to selectively probe nascent EVs and reveal their timely response to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy.\nWe firstly established an immunotherapy response model on 4T1bearing mouse36 by annotating PD-L1 antibody (PBS injection as the control) on day 7 and once/week thereafter for 4T1 breast tumor mouse (Fig. 5a). Simultaneously, we weekly injected Ac4ManNAz with the immunotherapy for three consecutive days to ensure the saturation of in vivo MGL on nascent EVs according to the results of our in vivo MGL test (Fig. 4g). During this process, we observed the suppression on tumor growth in the anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment group compared to the untreatment group (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 5). The results of hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and immunofluorescence staining further demonstrated the effectiveness of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy as increased apoptotic cells (anti-TUNEL staining) and infiltration of CD8+ T cells, as well as decreased cancer cells (antiKi67 staining) were shown (Fig. 5c).\nWe then collected and analyzed the mouse plasma samples at a series of time points post injection by Melac-Chip (Fig. 5a). After calibration (Supplementary Fig. 6a), we calculated the concentrations of\nthe newly-produced CD63+ EVs and found no significant difference between the treated and untreated groups (Fig. 5d), suggesting that the total plasma CD63+ EV production remains stable regardless of tumor growth and drug stimulation. Next, we moved to the nascent PD-L1+ EVs. Since the core of Melac-Chip is click chemistry-based capture followed by primary antibody recognition and secondary antibody amplification, the possible presence of anti-PD-L1 coverage, that is, certain PD-L1+ EVs may carry anti-PD-L1 antibody arising from the therapy, would in principle not affect the capturing (dependent on the azido-modification) nor the amplification (similar secondaryantibody-recognizable Fc regions on both the therapeutic and the detection anti-PD-L1 antibodies). To demonstrate this speculation, we extractedMGL EVs from 4T1 cells and used them as amodel to test the detection by Melac-Chip in the presence or absence of pre-incubation with the therapeutic anti-PD-L1 antibody, which showed a detectable PD-L1+ EV level close to each other (Supplementary Fig. 7). Similar to the data processing of nascent CD63+ EVs, we established a calibration curve for the PD-L1+ EVs (Supplementary Fig. 6b) and then estimated that the treatment had a significant impact on these EVs\u2019 production (Fig. 5e), which positively correlated to the tumor volume, with a slight decrease from day 10 to 17 and a slight increase in the week after (Fig. 5b, e). As a comparison, instead of Melac-Chip we tried a regular Chip-based method (CD63 antibody for capture) that allows for the quantification of total PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs (a predictor for immunotherapy response20) (Supplementary Fig. 6c, Fig. 5f). It turned out that the total PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs showed a good correlation with the tumor volume only in the untreated group. In the treated group, levels of these EVs increased till day 10 and then stayed stable thereafter, which was poorly correlated with the change trend of the tumor volume during this time period (Fig. 5b). Further Pearson correlation analysis confirmed the good correlation between nascent PD-L1+ EVs and tumor volume in the treated (R2 = 0.9611) and untreated (R2 = 0.9958) groups (measured by Melac-Chip), as well as the good correlation between the total PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs and tumor volume in the untreated (R2 = 0.8886) but not the treated (R2 = 0.2663) group (measured by a Chip-based method) (Fig. 5g). These data suggest that nascent PD-L1+ EVs that are onlymeasurablebyMelac-Chip can serve as amore universal indicator for tumor progression and immunotherapy response than total PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs, a previously used indicator20.\nBesides, we were also curious about the change trends of the nascent and pre-existing PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs. After using the azidoinduced isolation to remove thenascent EVs insteadof detecting them, we were able to capture the pre-existing CD63+ EVs by anti-CD63 antibody and then detect the PD-L1 level by anti-PD-L1 antibody (See Methods \u201cMicrofluidic detection of EVs with in vivo MGL\u201d for details). The levels of nascent PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs were generated via the subtraction of the pre-existing ones from the total that were measured in Fig. 5f. By plotting these data together (Supplementary Fig. 8), we found that in the untreated group both the nascent (R2 = 0.8914) and pre-existing (R2 = 0.8547) PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs exhibited the relatively good correlation to tumor volume, but in the treated group neither of them correlated well (R2 = 0.2424 & 0.1963 for the former and latter, respectively). Comparing to the high correlation between nascent PDL1+ EV and tumor volume, the poor correlation between nascent PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs and tumor volume hints that certain subtypes of EVs other than CD63+ EVs are more directly responsible to the immunotherapy.\nTo show the generality of Melac-Chip, we switched to the B16F10 melanoma-bearing mouse model which is resistant to the immunecheckpoint blockade41 (Supplementary Figs. 9, 11a\u2013c) for the quantification of nascent PD-L1+ EVs. After calibration (Supplementary Fig. 10), the detected levels of nascent PD-L1+ EVs again exhibited a good correlation to tumor volume in both the untreated and treated group (R2 = 0.9741 vs 0.9902, Supplementary Fig. 11d, g). Meanwhile, regular chip analysis also indicated the good correlation between pre-existing PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs and tumor volume (R2 = 0.9528 vs 0.9586) as well as\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6541 6\ntotal PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs and tumor volume (R2 = 0.9712 vs 0.9220) in the two groups (Supplementary Fig. 11e\u2013g). However, among the three indexing vesicles, nascent PD-L1+ EVs still correlated best to tumor volume, regardless of immunotherapy or not, which coincides well with the results in the 4T1 breast cancer mouse model. Therefore, Melac-Chip enables detection of nascent PD-L1+ EVs in both immunotherapy responded and resistant models, providing a timely and accurate reflection of tumor progression and therapy effect. A thorough understanding of EV function requires a dynamic view. Temporal differentiation is essential if one is to describe the dynamic response of EV to specific stimulus. Elucidating these dynamic changes in EV production at a given state is challenging and requires specialized techniques, which should be biocompatible and sensitive enough to quantify subtle changes in EV levels. Based on those techniques, taking a series of \u201csnapshots\u201d along EV production will help us understand the temporal dynamics and provide invaluable\n** **\n**\n600\n400\n200 0C on\nce nt\nra tio\nn (n\ng \u03bcL\n-1 ) 1000\n800 Untreated Treated\na\nDays7 2114 17\nAnti-PD-L1 antibody therapy Blood collection\n2410\nAc4ManNAz injection 4T1 cell injection (Day 0)\nSA\nSecondary antibody\n\u03b2-Gal FDG\nCD63 antibody\nd 200\n150\n100\n50 0C on\nce nt\nra tio\nn (n\ng \u03bcL\n-1 )\ne\nf\nSA BiotinCD63 antibody\nTotal PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs Untreatedg\ncb 1500\n1000\n500\n0\nH&E TUNEL CD8 Ki67\n100 \u03bcmT re\nat ed\nU nt\nre at\ned\nSA\nSecondary antibody\n\u03b2-Gal\nFDG\nPD-L1 antibody\nSecondary antibody\n\u03b2-Gal\nFDG\nPD-L1 antibody\nTu m\nor V\nol um\ne (m\nm 3 )\nNascent PD-L1+ EVs\n600\n400\n200 0C on\nce nt\nra tio\nn (n\ng \u03bcL\n-1 ) 1000\n800\nUntreated Treated\nUntreated Treated\nR2 = 0.8886 P = 0.0573 R2 = 0.9958 P = 0.0021\n0 140 280 420 560 700 Tumor Volume (mm3)\n600\n400\n200\n0\n800\nC on\nce nt\nra tio\nn (n\ng \u03bcL\n-1 ) Total PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs\nNascent PD-L1+ EVs\nUntreated Treated\nNascent CD63+ EVs\nHB-Chip HB-Chip\nHB-Chip\nR2 = 0.2663 P = 0.4840 R2 = 0.9611 P = 0.0196\n0 60 120 180\n100\n0\n200 Treated C on ce nt ra tio n (n g \u03bcL -1 )\nTumor Volume (mm3)\nTotal PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs Nascent PD-L1+ EVs\nweeks 0 1 2 3 4\nweeks 0 1 2 3 4\nweeks 0 1 2 3 4\nweeks 0 1 2 3 4\nBiotinBiotin\nFig. 5 | Analyzing nascent EVs in response to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. a Schematic of the tumor implantation, PD-L1 antibody immunotherapy, metabolic glycan labeling and sample collection on a 4T1-bearing mouse model. b Tumor growth curves of 4T1-bearing mice with/without PD-L1 antibody treatment.

The strength of the approach lies in that metabolic glycan labeling facilitates the efficient differentiation of nascent EVs against a bewildering background of pre-existing ones. Through subsequent click chemistry and mixing-accelerated herringbonemicrofluidics, newly-produced EVs can be selectively isolated for specific antibody-based quantification. Here we demonstrate that metabolic glycan labeling of EV is biologically compatible (labeling does not appreciably affect EV morphology and proteome) and efficient (4 h of labeling is sufficient to EV identification on chip). Using Melac-Chip we were able to detect the production of nascent PD-L1+ EVs after each anti-PD-L1 administration, and prove nascent PD-L1+ EVs to be a more accurate predictor than total PD-L1+ CD63+ EVs for tumor progression and therapy response. Overall, the combination of EV metabolic labeling and efficient microfluidic enrichment improve our ability to accurately analyze EV secretion over time, which should enable the study of EV secretion mechanisms as well as the in-depth exploration of EV biological function and clinical value. Besides adding a temporal dimension to our understanding of EV dynamics in immunotherapy, in principle Melac-Chip can also be applied to study EV dynamics that is stimulated by a broad range of cues, such as microbial infection, environmental (temperature, light, and gravity) variation, and diet change."

            "text": "Five \u00b5L mouse plasma or 5 \u00b5g tissue-derived EVs was incubated with 12.5 \u00b5M DBCO-PEG4-biotin in 20\u03bcL PBS with 0.5% BSA at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The products were loaded into the SA-Chip with a flow rate of 1.25mL h-1. The subsequent process was the same as in the section of \u201cMicrofluidic detection of MGL EVs\u201d.\nFor biodistribution profiling, 2.5 \u00d7 105 4T1 cells were subcutaneously injected into BALB/c mice. On day 21, Ac4ManNAz was injected (20 \u00b5L of 25mM Ac4ManNAz in i. t. and 100 \u00b5L of 140mM Ac4ManNAz in i. p.) oncedaily for three consecutive days to 4T1 tumorbearing mice. On day 24, the mice were euthanized for blood, tumor, heart, liver, lung, and kidney isolation. Then tissue-derived EVs were separated as described in the section of \u201cIsolation of tissue EVs\u201d and detected as described above in this section (using anti-CD63 as the primary antibody).\nTo investigate the timewindow for the analysis of in vivoMGL EVs with Melac-Chip, 2.5 \u00d7 105 4T1 cells were subcutaneously injected into BALB/c mice. On day 14, Ac4ManNAz was injected (20 \u00b5L of 25mM\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6541 9\nAc4ManNAz in i. t. and 100 \u00b5L of 140mMAc4ManNAz in i. p.) oncedaily to 4T1 tumor-bearing mice for up to 4 days. The mouse plasma samples were collected each day starting from day 14, and detected as described above in this section (using anti-PD-L1 as the primary antibody).\nTo detect the pre-existing PD-L1+ EVs, 5 \u00b5L mouse plasma was incubated with 12.5 \u00b5M DBCO-PEG4-biotin in 20\u03bcL PBS with 0.5% BSA at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Then, the products were incubated with 5 \u00b5L SA-beads (GE Life) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h to remove the nascent EVs through beads capturing. After centrifugation (587 g for 5min), the supernatant was collected and loaded to the anti-CD63 modified chip. The detection signals were then read out by the fluorescence enzyme immunoassay via sequential introduction of anti-PD-L1 antibody, \u03b2-galactosidase conjugated secondary antibody, and FDG."

For FFPE sections, antigen retrieval by steaming in citrate buffer (pH = 6.0) was performed before blocking. The FFPE sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C, followed by incubation with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Samples were observed using an Ortho-Fluorescent Microscopy (Pannoramic 250 FLASH)."

Statistical significance was determined using paired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-tests or one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) when appropriate. Asterisks are used to indicated statistical significance (*P <0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <0.001, ****P < 0.0001), and n.s. indicates non-significance (P >0.05). All experiments were independently repeated at least three times with similar results. No statisticalmethodwas used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment."
