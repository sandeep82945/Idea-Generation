Meanwhile, the antioxidant activity of CP was enhanced. Phenolic acids,\nflavonol glycosides, fatty acids, and alkyl glycosides were marker compounds\nthat were responsible for distinguishing the storage time of CP. Correlation\nanalysis suggested that some polyphenols including quercetin-glucoside, quinic acid,\ntrihydroxydimethoxyflavone, and rutin were potential antioxidant compounds in CP. The\ndichloromethane and n-butanol fractions showed the better antioxidant capacity and\ninhibitory effects on glucose-hydrolysis enzymes. They mainly contained ferulic acid, nobiletin, 3,5,6,7,8,3\u2032,4\u2032-heptamethoxyflavone, kaempferol, and hesperidin.\nKeywords: citrus peel, metabolomics, polymethoxyflavones, biological activity, quantitative\nINTRODUCTION\nCitrus peel (CP) is the dried and mature peel of Citrus reticulata Blanco and its cultivars. It is not only a common fruit, but also possesses various health benefits. It has been widely desired by many consumers due to its unique aroma (1). The main production areas of CP are Guangdong, Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi Province of China. CP can be divided into common CP and Canton CP according to its plantation origins, where Canton CP is mainly produced in Xinhui City, Guangdong Province. Most studies have shown that CP is a beneficial food with a wide range of health benefits, such as antiinflammation, antiasthmatic, antithrombosis, anticarcinogenesis, and antioxidation activities (2\u20134). More than hundreds of compounds have been purified and identified in CP, mainly including polymethoxyflavones (PMFs), limonin, and alkaloids (5\u20137).\nPolymethoxyflavones of CP usually exist as the forms of glycosides, and their structures are very similar. These PMFs mainly include sinensetin, 3,5,6,7,8,3\u2019,4\u2019-heptamethoxyflavone, 5,7,8,3\u2019,4\u2019-pentamethoxyflavone, hesperidin, and nobiletin. Numerous studies have shown that PMFs possess antiinflammatory and antitumor activities, and have been recognized as typical bioactive substances of CP (8, 9). The\nFIGURE 1 | The HPLC spectrum of four analytes (A) and CP samples (B).\nquantitative analysis of these components have been employed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-diode array detection (LC-DAD), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (10, 11). Li et al. used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantitatively analyze 6 kinds of PMFs in different commercial CP extracts (12). Fu\net al. established a simple and accurate method by using HPLC with dual-wavelength detection to determine the contents of a flavanone glycoside (hesperidin) and 5 kinds of PMFs in CP (13). Camarda et al. quantified flavonoids in citrus herbs by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (14).\nIt is believed that the quality of CP is improved with storage years (15). Some studies have found that the contents of flavonoids, such as hesperidin, nobiletin, and tangeretin in CP, increased with storage years (16). On the contrary, some studies showed that with the increase of storage years, the content of PMFs decreased (17). However, the comprehensive analysis on the chemical changes of various main and trace metabolites of CP during storing was still unclear so far. Therefore, it is worth deeply investigating the relationship between the chemical profiling changes of CP and its biological activities.\nMetabolomics analysis is a potent tool in identifying chemical constituents of foods and plants. Untargeted metabolomics analysis provides dynamic changes in metabolites and could be used to find the difference between the samples, which is limited by the resolution of the analytical instrument. Although, targeted metabolomics is usually used to quantify the differential compounds by optimizing the pretreatment method and the chromatographic and mass spectrometry separation conditions, which can provide a result with good repeatability and sensitivity. However, it is limitedly used to analyze a large number of marker compounds due to the time-consuming methodology (18\u201321).\nIn the present study, the effects of storage years (1-, 3-, 4- , 5-, 6-, and 11-years) on the chemical profiling and potential bioactive compounds of CP were compared by metabolomics and in vitro bioactivity analysis. The aim of this study was to identify the marker compounds of CP during storage and find the relationship between these compounds and the biological activities of CP, furthermore providing a new strategy of thought of comprehensive utilization of CP."

As shown in Figure 1A, 4 kinds of PMFs had good selectivity inreverse phase elution system under optimized chromatographic conditions, thereinto, hesperidin had the shortest retention time compared to other standards due to its glycoside structure, which was consistent with the results of previous studies (30, 31). In addition, these four PMFs also had good selectivity as shown in Figure 1B, andmost of the other unknown peaks were qualitatively analyzed by LC-MS.\nCalibration curves of these PMFs were established with six levels of concentration and covered ranges at 5\u2013200\u00b5g/mL. The linearity and correlation coefficient (r) of the calibration curves are presented in Table 1. The correlation coefficient of these calibration curves was \u22650.9999, which indicated that these calibration curves of PMFs had a good linearity.\nAfter a period of storage, CP possesses a unique flavor and some health benefits (32). Meanwhile, there were some changes of chemical constituents in CP during storage, which may affect some biological activities. As shown in Table 2, using the calibration curves of the main compounds, the changes of four flavonoids in CP with different storage years were determined. The contents of hesperidin, nobiletin, 3,5,6,7,8,3\u2019,4\u2019- heptamethoxyflavone, and tangeretin were higher in CP after 4-years of storage than other years of storage. However, as the storage time increases, the contents of these four PMFs marginally decreased. It indicated that CP needed at least 4-years of storage and it could be stored for a long time (31). Thereinto, hesperidin markedly changed during storage, for instance, its content mildly increased after a short time of storage (\u22644-years\nof storage) while it significantly decreased after a long time of storage. After 11-years of storage, the content of hesperidin was 8.98\u00b1 1.80 mg/g, even lower than that (13.05\u00b1 0.71) after 1-year of storage.

            "text": "Each method of determining antioxidant capacity has its limitations and may cause biases (44). Therefore, a single measurement method is not perfect when evaluating antioxidant capacity. In this work, the antioxidant capacity of CP was investigated by combining three methods. It should be noted that the smaller the IC50 value, the stronger the scavenging ability and antioxidant capacity. As summarized in Figure 4,\ndifferent antioxidant activities were observed among the 6 CP samples tested.\nThe free radical scavenger can capture the single electron of DPPH and make its color lighter so that the maximum absorption wavelength will linearly decrease. The decrease of light absorption value indicates that the antioxidant capacity is enhanced, so as to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of the test samples (45). According to Figure 4A, the DPPH radical scavenging activity of IC50 were, in an ascending order, 1.529 \u00b1 0.023 mg/mL (1-year), 1.132 \u00b1 0.123 mg/mL (4-year), 0.963 \u00b1 0.100 mg/mL (3-year), 0.842 \u00b1 0.137 mg/mL (6-year), 0.736 \u00b1 0.062 mg/mL (11-year), and 0.734 \u00b10.038 mg/mL (5-year), respectively. Thus, CP stored for 5-years displayed the strongest antioxidant capacity, followed by CP stored 11-years, while the weakest antioxidant capacity was detected in CP stored 1-year. In a previous study, the antioxidant capacity of fruits, vegetables, and other plants generally increased after storing for longer at cold temperature (46). Such increase could be related to the increase of antioxidant compounds over time. In this study, the antioxidant active compounds may mainly include polyphenols, fatty acids, organic acids, and amino acids.\nABTS formed ABTS+ with hydroperoxide and peroxidase, and the maximum absorption wavelength of the mixture of ABTS+ and iron\u2013myoglobin was 820 nm, 734 nm, and 650 nm. The OD value of the mixture at the maximum absorption wavelength decreased in the presence of a hydrogen donor. The antioxidant capacity of antioxidants directly affects the decreased degree of OD value, and so the decreased degree of OD value can reflect the antioxidant capacity (47). According to Figure 4B, the\nFrontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 11 February 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 825381\nABTS radical scavenging activity of IC50 was, in an ascending order, 61.86 \u00b1 4.41 mg/mL (4-year), 61.36 \u00b1 3.34 mg/mL (3- year), 57.503 \u00b1 1.588 mg/mL (6-year), 50.277 \u00b1 3.301 mg/mL (5-year), 46.763 \u00b1 4.631 mg/mL (1-year), and 32.797 \u00b1 2.405 mg/mL (11-year). Thus, the strongest antioxidant capacity was detected is CP stored for 11-years, followed by the storage time of 1-, 5-, 6-, 3-, and 4-years. These results indicate that the chemical composition changes of CP during storage affect its antioxidant capacity.\nThe principle of FRAP method is that Fe3+-tripyridyltriazine (TPTZ) has the maximum absorption peak at 593 nm, and is reduced to Fe2+ form under the action of antioxidant substances, which is blue, and the absorption value increases. The larger FRAP value indicates the stronger reducing ability of antioxidants (48). According to the absorbance of the extract, the corresponding Fe2+ concentration can be calculated by the calibration curves and the antioxidant capacity of CP can be obtained. As presented in Figure 4C, the reducing ability of total flavonoids to the ferric ion of CP showed a significant increasing trend with the storage years, indicating that the CP stored for 11-years had the strongest antioxidant capacity.\nOwing to the more abundance of flavonoids in CP\u2019s, their antioxidant activity is also higher than other fruits or plants (49). In Table 2, as storage time increased, the content of flavonoids increased in general, and therefore the CP (11-year) has the highest antioxidant activity. Furthermore, there might be other\ncompounds in the crude extracts that would have contributed to the activity, such as phenols, organic acids, and so on.\nThe Inhibitory Effects of Different Storage"

When the sample solution was added to the system, the activity of \u03b1-glucoside enzyme was inhibited in the sample solution, and the amount of p-nitrophenol generated at the same time was reduced, which lead to a decrease in the light absorption value (50, 51). According to Figure 5A, \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition activity of IC50 were, in an ascending order, 1.039\u00b1 0.022mg/mL (6-year), 0.911 \u00b1 0.045 mg/mL (1-year), 0.778 \u00b1 0.027 mg/mL (11-year), 0.641 \u00b1 0.069 mg/mL (4-year), 0.591 \u00b1 0.030 mg/mL (5-year), and 0.460 \u00b1 0.007 mg/mL (3-year). Thus, the strongest \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition capacity was detected in CP stored for 3- years, followed by the storage time of 5-, 4-, 11-, 1-, and 6-years, while the CP stored for 6-years had the weakest \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition capacity.\n\u03b1-Amylase activity was determined based on the principle of \u03b1-amylase cracking starch to produce reducing sugar, which reacted with DNS solution to produce dark compounds. When the sample solution was added to the system, the \u03b1-amylase\nFrontiers in Nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 12 February 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 825381\nactivity was inhibited, and the amount of reducing sugar which lead to the decrease of light absorption at the same time (52, 53). According to Figure 5B, \u03b1-amylase inhibition activity of IC50 was, in an ascending order, 50.457 \u00b1 1.941 mg/mL (4-year), 46.687 \u00b1 0.831 mg/mL (6-year), 26.653 \u00b1 1.000 mg/mL (11- year), 15.897 \u00b1 0.609 mg/mL (3-year), 11.537 \u00b1 1.289 mg/mL (5-year), and 11.250\u00b1 0.941 mg/mL (1-year). Thus, the strongest \u03b1-amylase inhibition capacity was detected in CP stored 1-year, followed by the storage time of 5-, 3-, 11-, 6-, and 4-years, while the CP stored for 4-years had the weakest \u03b1-amylase inhibition capacity.\nThe analysis showed that there was no definite correlation between the ability of the inhibiting digestive enzyme activity and the different storage years. The antidigestive enzyme ability of CP was also closely related to the growing environment of fruit trees, the way of harvesting and processing, except during its storage years. A Pearson\u2019s correlation was analyzed to determine the relationship between marker compound and antioxidant activity/hypoglycemic activities of 6 citrus samples, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is listed in Table 4.\nCompounds including quercetin- glucoside, quinic acid, trihydroxydimethoxyflavone, and\nhydroxy-methoxy-phenylpropionic acid were the marker compounds that had a positive correlation with antioxidant activity. The Pearson correlation coefficient \u22650.5 between compounds, and \u03b1-glucosidase/\u03b1-amylase showed a potential capability of inhibiting the enzymatic activity."

The inhibition rate of n-butanol fraction was much higher than other parts under the same concentration as shown in Figure 6A. The IC50 value of the n-butanol fraction was 1.75 mg/ml, whereas the IC50 values of dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and water fractions were 9.55, 16.84, and 8.61 mg/ml, respectively, which elucidated that there were significant differences in the activity of different fractions.\nThe petroleum ether, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate fractions of CP had no obvious inhibitory activity on \u03b1-amylase but n-butanol and residual extract had significant inhibitory activity on \u03b1-amylase. The inhibition rate of n-butanol fraction was much higher than other parts under the same concentration as shown in Figure 6B. The IC50 value of residual extract was 25.22 mg/ml and that of n-butanol fraction was 101.10 mg/mL. Therefore, the inhibition of \u03b1-amylase was mainly caused by hydrophilic molecules.\nAntioxidant Activity of Different Fractions of CP According to Figure 7A, the n-butanol fraction had the strongest DPPH free-radical scavenging ability and its IC50 value was 5.12 mg/mL, while the petroleum ether fraction had the weakest DPPH free radical scavenging ability. The capacity of each fraction to scavenge DPPH radical can be listed in the order of n-butanol > ethyl acetate > dichloromethane > water > petroleum ether. Combined with Table 5, it was clear that the antioxidant activities were supposed to be ascribed to hesperidin.\nABTS free-radical scavenging experiment showed that all the fractions had no ABTS antioxidant capacity. The concentration of each fraction was 200 mg/mL, and the content of flavonoids in each fraction was low. Combined with the experimental results in 3.4, the IC50 of ABTS scavenging ability of CP of different years was 32.80\u201361.87mg /mL, and another evidence listed in Table 2 indicated that the concentration threshold of flavonoid to scavenge ABTS free radical should be much higher than the concentration of flavonoid in the different fractions listed in Table 5.\nThe reduction ability of Fe2+ of different fractions was different, as shown in Figure 7B, which can be listed in the order of n-butanol > ethyl acetate > dichloromethane > water > petroleum ether. The reduction ability of petroleum ether fraction was almost 0. This order showed the same tendency with that of DPPH free radical scavenging ability, which was also strongly linked with the contents of flavonoid compounds distributed in different fractions.\nInterestingly, in spite of adopting three different antioxidant bioassay platforms, the n-butanol fraction was consistently observed to be the most antioxidant agent among all 5 fractions (petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, nbutanol, and water fractions) tested. Flavonoids contents are prolific in CP and are known for having an antioxidant\neffect. In this study, we only discussed the trend of 4 PMFs (hesperidin, nobiletin, 3,5,6,7,8,3\u2019,4\u2019-heptamethoxyflavone, and tangeretin) with the extension of time. Nevertheless, there might be other compounds in the crude extracts that would have contributed to the activity. Therefore, in Table 6, we mainly identified 11 compounds in dichloromethane fraction and 14 compounds in n-butanol fraction. Thereinto, vanillic acid, ferulic acid, and other compounds in CP might be good for the antioxidation activity."

The dichloromethane fraction mainly contained ferulic acid, nobiletin, and 3,5,6,7,8,3\u2019,4\u2019-heptamethoxyflavone. The n-butanol fraction mainly contained kaempferol and hesperidin."

Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed significant differences among CP with different storage years, and a total of 47 different compounds were identified from CP, mainly including flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic acids, amino acids, and fatty acids. However, the quantitative analysis of CP with different storage years did not show certain rules. Through this study, we can understand the complex internal mechanism that affects the quality of CP, and further research is needed to reveal the exact mechanism."
