Development of Real-time Granger Causality Assessment Tools: Investigate methodologies for real-time data analysis, focusing on financial markets or macroeconomic indicators. Given the volatility and the constant influx of new information, real-time tools could significantly benefit traders, policymakers, and researchers by providing instant insights into causality relationships as they evolve.

Extending the Framework to High-Dimensional Data: With the increasing availability of large datasets, future research could focus on extending the proposed Granger causality testing framework to handle high-dimensional data efficiently. This would involve developing dimensionality reduction techniques and regularization methods that can be incorporated into the quantile regression models without compromising the robustness of the tests against temporal instabilities.

Machine Learning Integration for Predictive Modeling: Explore the integration of machine learning algorithms with the Granger causality testing framework to improve predictive modeling, especially in unstable environments. This could involve using machine learning to identify relevant quantiles or structural breaks automatically, enhancing the test's adaptability and predictive power in complex datasets.

Sector-Specific Applications and Comparative Studies: Conduct sector-specific empirical applications of the proposed Granger causality tests, such as in healthcare, environmental science, or social sciences, where data volatility and structural breaks are prevalent. Comparative studies could also be undertaken to assess the performance of the proposed framework against traditional methods across different sectors, providing insights into its versatility and applicability.

Robustness Checks Against Nonlinear Dynamics and Network Effects: Further research could focus on assessing the robustness of the proposed Granger causality tests in the presence of nonlinear dynamics and network effects, particularly in complex systems like financial markets or ecosystems. This would involve developing extensions or modifications to the framework that can capture and account for nonlinear interactions and the interconnectedness of variables within a network.
