In these late-stage modifications, oxidative enzymes play n essential role in structural diversification and complexity eneration. Biosynthetic studies regarding the oxidative transormations are essential for understanding nature\u2019s strategy or generating the complex and structurally diverse natural roducts. The accumulation of knowledge about biosynthetic path-\nays of various natural products, as well as advances in genome equencing technologies and bioinformatic tools, has allowed esearchers to rapidly access the genetic information about the argeted natural products ( Medema et al. 2015 ) . After the idenification of candidate genes, the biosynthetic pathways can e elucidated in genetic and biochemical ways. Given that the umbers of biosynthetic genes for fungal natural products are maller than those for bacterial ones, reconstitution in the hetrologous host is one of the practical approaches used to eluciate the biosynthetic pathway of fungal metabolites. Once the hole biosynthetic pathway and the function of each biosynhetic enzyme are elucidated, these enzymes can be used as iocatalysts for the synthesis of complex molecules. Thereore, functional characterization of the unique enzymes inolved in the skeletal construction and the modifications of natral products are quite important. Our recent progress in the iosynthetic studies of fungal natural products is summarized n this review. In the next section, the strategy for refactoring he biosynthetic pathways in the heterologous host Aspergillus ryzae with efficient genome-editing technique is introduced. n the subsequent sections, selected examples of late-stage xidations in the biosynthesis of fungal natural products are escribed.\nefactoring the biosynthetic pathways of ungal natural products in A. oryzae\ns mentioned above, the expression of biosynthetic genes in heterologous host is a practical strategy for the biosyntheis of natural products. For biosynthetic studies of fungal natral products, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used s a host strain ( Harvey et al. 2018 ) . Fungal host strains, such s A. oryzae and A. nidulans have also been used for biosynhetic studies ( Fujii 2009 ; Lazarus et al. 2014 ) . Following the pineering work that employed the A. oryzae expression system, hich focused on the functional characterization of the wA ene from A. nidulans ( Watanabe et al. 1998 ) , this expression sysem has been widely used for the functional analysis of indiidual biosynthetic enzymes, as well as refactoring the whole iosynthetic pathways ( Heneghan et al. 2010 ; Fujii et al. 2011 ) . s described in the other review ( Oikawa 2020 ) , the A. oryzae xpression system has several important advantages, includng the rapid preparation of transformants using genomic DNA hat employs the host-derived splicing system. In A. oryzae , exgenous genes can be integrated into ectopic sites via nonhoologous end joining ( NHEJ ) -mediated repair of double-strand reaks. Due to this feature, screening of transformants is ofen necessary to obtain high-yielding ones. To avoid this extra tep, gene targeting at specific chromosomal loci, rather than HEJ-mediated random integration, would be preferable. The xploration of genetic loci suitable for expression of exogenous enes and the application of the genome-editing techniques to he refactoring of biosynthetic pathways are introduced in this ection.\nTo establish the reliable expression in A. oryzae , the integraion sites of exogenous genes in the genomes of high-yielding . oryzae transformants were initially analyzed. The genomes\nf the transformants constructed in the biosynthetic studies of etaenones ( Ugai et al. 2015 ) and cyclohelminthols ( Ugai et al. 020 ) were sequenced and compared with that of the reference train A. oryzae RIB40. As a result, the possible integration sites f exogenous biosynthetic genes in those strains were identified. hese integration sites were considered suitable for the expresion of exogenous genes and were defined as hot spots ( HSs ) 201, 01, 601, and 801, respectively ( Figure 1 a ) . For the site-specific inegration of exogenous genes into these HSs, the CRISPR/Cas9 ystem developed for A. oryzae was used ( Katayama et al. 2016 ) . he genome-editing plasmid harboring the cas9 gene and the ingle-guide RNAs designed for each HS are introduced into A. ryzae . To enable the integration of exogenous gene ( s ) by hoologous recombination ( HR ) , the donor plasmid harboring the argeted genes and 1-kb homology sequences are simultaneusly introduced with the genome-editing plasmid ( Figure 1 b ) . ecause a ligD disruptant of A. oryzae was known to exhibit high ene-targeting efficiency ( Mizutani et al. 2008 ) , A. oryzae NSPlD1 Maruyama and Kitamoto 2008 ) , a ligD disruptant, was selected o suppress the undesired NHEJ pathway. As a result, screeningree isolation of the desired transformants that harbor the taret biosynthetic gene ( s ) was achieved. In this method, selection arker was embedded in the genome-editing plasmid and not ntegrated into the chromosome of A. oryzae . In other CRISPRased knock-in methods developed in recent years, exogenous enes are often integrated with selection markers ( Pohl et al. 020 ; Wei et al. 2021 ) . The combination of this HS-knock-in stratgy with the recycling of AMA1-based genome-editing plasmids Katayama et al. 2019 ) enabled repeated and marker-free integraion of the target gene ( s ) , thus allowing the rapid reconstitution f the biosynthetic pathway of fungal metabolites, which conists of a multitude of biosynthetic genes.\nEmploying this HS-knock-in method, expression and splicng of the basidiomycota-derived genes were examined using he biosynthetic genes for the livestock antibiotic pleuromutilin, hich were previously characterized by heterologous expression f cDNAs in A. oryzae ( Yamane et al. 2017 ) . Given that most of the ntrons existing in the introduced genes were correctly spliced, 0 sesquiterpene synthases ( STSs ) found in the 2 basidiomyota fungi were further analyzed using genomic DNA sequences. as chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the transormants revealed that 16 transformants produced the products, ndicating that the corresponding STSs were correctly expressed nd spliced in A. oryzae . Although the remaining 14 STSs conained 1 or 2 nonspliced introns, the removal of nonspliced inrons and the subsequent expression in Escherichia coli yielded he sesquiterpene products. In total, the products derived from 9 STSs were successfully identified ( Nagamine et al. 2019 ) . The athway refactoring of basidiomycota diterpene erinacine Q was lso achieved using the HS-knock-in method ( Liu et al. 2019 ) . lthough several unexpected problems\u2014byproduct formation n EriC reaction and no conversion in EriA reaction\u2014were oberved in the P450-catalyzed reactions, the extensive analysis f the transformants expressing the biosynthetic genes in varius combinations enabled the elucidation of the whole pathway eading to the natural product. Notably, short-chain dehydrogease/reductase EriH was found to be responsible for assisting eactions catalyzed by EriA and EriC. Cognate cytochrome P450 eductase derived from the producing strain also helped these eactions. The above-cited 2 studies demonstrated that A. oryzae an be an efficient host for the biosynthesis of basidiomycotaerived natural products. The HS-knock-in method has also een used for the biosynthetic study of various fungal natural roducts, including indole diterpenes ( IDTs ) , polyketides, and a onribosomal peptide ( NRP ) ( Figure 1 c ) ( Jiang et al. 2020 , 2021 ;\nFigure 1.

Oxidative transformations in the biosynthesis of fungal natural products Cytochrome P450s in the biosynthesis of fungal terpenoids\nCytochrome P450s ( P450s ) are heme-containing monooxygenases that catalyze various oxidative transformations ( Podust and Sherman 2012 ; Zhang and Li 2017 ) . In the biosynthesis of fungal natural products, P450s are often involved in complex transformations, such as oxidative cyclizations, as well as conventional hydroxylation and epoxidation, contributing to the structural diversifications and complexity generation ( Zhang et al. 2021 ) . Selected examples of oxidative transformations in fungal natural product biosynthesis are introduced in this section.\nLolitrems, tremorgenic mycotoxins produced by Epichlo\u00eb festicae var. lolii , are IDTs that have the characteristic 5/6 bicyclic\nystem ( A/B rings ) that is substituted on the indole ring. Two enes encoding prenyltransferase and P450, ltmE and ltmJ , repectively, are known to be specific to the lolitrem-producing train and are proposed to be responsible for the construction of /B rings ( Saikia et al. 2012 ) . The enzymatic construction of the /B rings mediated by LtmE and LtmJ was analyzed by refactorng the biosynthetic pathway of lolitrems and the bioconversion f biosynthetic intermediates. After the formation of common ntermediates such as terpendole I, LtmE catalyzed the diprenyation of indole moiety, followed by the sequential oxidation and yclization by LtmJ to construct the A/B rings ( Figure 2 a ) . A careul examination of the biotransformation of terpendole I by the . oryzae transformant expressing LtmE and LtmJ revealed that he epoxy alcohol 1 was identified to be an intermediate ( Jiang t al. 2020 ) . In the biosynthesis of an indole sesquiterpene ( IST ) espendole, SpdJ, a cytochrome P450 closely related to LtmJ, catlyzed the formation of an epoxy alcohol, but further cyclizaion did not proceed ( Figure 2 a ) ( Kudo et al. 2018 ) . Notably, LtmE nd LtmJ accepted various IDTs and ISTs as substrates, proucing natural and unnatural congeners of lolitrems. Relaxed ubstrate specificities of the 2 enzymes made them attractive\nFigure 2. P450-catalyzed oxidative cyclization in the biosynthesis of lolitrems.

Based on a previous study that reported radical-induced poxide opening ( Barton et al. 1981 ) , the mechanism for LtmJatalyzed oxidative cyclization was proposed, as shown in igure 2 b. After the hydrogen abstraction from 1 , the resulting ubstrate radical would be converted to the alkoxy radical. adical-induced epoxide opening was known in isomerization f \u03b1,\u03b2-epoxyketone to carbocycles ( Rawal et al. 1993 ) . A subseuent 1,5-hydrogen transfer produced the enol radical, which ould then undergo intramolecular addition to the double bond f the prenyl moiety in a 6- exo selective manner. The proposed echanism of the first cyclization was firmly supported by ensity functional theory calculation and a model experiment ith a synthetic analog ( Jiang et al. 2020 ) . Another unique P450-mediated transformation was found in\nhe biosynthesis of brassicicenes ( BCs ) . BCs are structurally dierse diterpenes produced by the fungus Alternaria brassicicola hat causes dark leaf spots in Brassica sp. ( MacKinnon et al. 1999 ; edras et al. 2009 ) . BCs, such as brassicicene A ( BC-A ) , have a used 5-8-5 tricyclic system, which is related to fusicoccin A nd cotylenin A ( Figure 3 a ) . Although all BCs were proposed to ave the same ring systems, the structures of brassicicene D BC-D ) and other related congeners were revised to those conaining tricyclo[9.2.1.0]tetradecane skeletons ( Tang et al. 2016 ) . biosynthetic study of BCs revealed that the cytochrome P450 scF catalyzed the oxidation of brassicicene I ( BC-I ) , producing he structurally distinct BC-B and 2 , thus serving as a key branch oint in the biosynthetic pathway of BCs ( Figure 3 b ) ( Tazawa et l . 2018 ) . This finding suggests that BscF abstracts H-12 of BC-I\nnd the subsequent O -rebound to the substrate radical to generte BC-B. In this reaction, the substrate radical also provides the earranged product 2 . For this latter transformation, 1 electron xidation of the substrate radical to the secondary cation, folowed by the Wagner\u2013Meerwein rearrangement, was proposed. lternatively, a formal 1,2-shift of the substrate radical was also iscussed as a possible route. P450-catalyzed oxidative rearangements have often been proposed in the biosynthesis of ungal natural products ( Zhang et al. 2021 ) . In contrast to these nzymes that usually generate a single product, BscF is a unique nzyme that produces 2 structurally different products from the ingle substrate.\nOxidative transformations mediated by P450s and/or the ther oxidoreductases are also found in various fungal terenoids, such as terpestacin and abscisic acid ( Narita et al. 2018 ; akino et al. 2018 , 2019 ) . In the biosynthesis of conidiogenone, a onidiation-inducing factor of Penicillium fungi, PrP450 catalyzes rounds of oxidations, converting deoxyconidiogenol to conidogenone ( Figure 4 ) ( Shiina et al. 2019 ) . Betaestacins are sesterterenes that are identified through genome mining of bifunctional erpene synthases ( Narita et al. 2017 ; Gao et al. 2018 ) . BtcB Pb , a 450 derived from Phoma betae , catalyzes the six-step oxidation f 2 methyl groups of betaestacin I, producing diacid betaestacin I. In contrast, BtcB CO , an orthologous P450 in Colletotrichum oriculare , catalyzes the 3-step oxidation of betaestacin I to beaestacin IV. Another P450, BtcC CO , then converts betaestacin IV o four products, betaestacin Va\u2013Vd ( Gao et al. 2018 ) . A unique ationic rearrangement of putative epoxide was proposed for he mechanism of BtcC CO catalysis. In the biosynthesis of fungal atural products, multiple oxidations by a single P450 are often\nFigure 3. The biosynthetic pathway of brassicicenes ( BCs ) .

In the iosynthesis of fungal dimeric anhydrides, non-heme iron- and -ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases ( \u03b1KGDOs ) , rather than 450s, are often involved in the late-stage oxidations ( Figure 5 a ) Williams et al. 2022 ) . In the biosynthesis of protein phosphataseinhibitor rubratoxin A, four \u03b1KGDOs\u2014RbtB, RbtE, RbtG, and btU\u2014are involved in the oxidations of nonadride core ( Bai t al. 2017 ) . A similar \u03b1KGDO gene, pvL5 , was also identified n the biosynthetic gene cluster ( BGC ) of herbicide cornexistin Williams et al. 2017 ) .\nZopfiellin ( 3 ) is the potent fungicide produced by Zopfiella urvata No. 37-3. Unlike other fungal dimeric anhydrides with nine-membered ring, 3 has a unique eight-membered ring Figure 5 a and b ) . In the biosynthesis of 3 , an \u03b1KGDO ZopK catlyzes hydroxylation at C-3 of 4 . The resulting compound is urther converted by ZopK, leading to 5, which has the same ight-membered ring to 3 ( Shiina et al. 2020 ) . Feeding experients of 13 C-labeled precursors indicated the loss of C-3 durng this unique ring contraction ( Figure 5 b ) . A consistent re-\nult was also reported for ZopL9, an orthologous \u03b1KGDO in the opfiellin-producing fungus Diffractella curvata CBS 591.74 ( de attos-Shipley et al. 2020 ) . Successive oxidations by a single KGDO were also found in the biosynthesis of phomoidride B Yamamoto et al. 2022 ) . TstK catalyzed three rounds of oxidation o install \u03b1-ketol moiety on the alkyl side chain of 6 to yield phooidride A ( Figure 5 c ) . This oxidation sets the stage for unusual icyclic ketal formation catalyzed by the methyltransferase TstE.\nstYa family proteins in the biosynthesis of fungal eptides\nstYa family proteins, also known as DUF3328-domain containng proteins, are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of riosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified pepides ( RiPPs ) of fungal origin ( Figure 6 a ) . Two genes, ustYa and stYb , were identified in the BGC of ustiloxin B ( 7 ) ( Umemura et al. 014 ) and found to be involved in the oxidative cyclization to onstruct a 13-membered macrocyclic ether ( Ye et al. 2016 ) . The nvolvement of the ustYa homologue in the cyclization process as also reported in the biosynthesis of asperipin-2a ( Nagano t al. 2016 ; Ye et al. 2019 ) . Based on these findings, UstYa family roteins are considered to be oxidases, which are distinct from nown enzymes, such as P450s and \u03b1KGDOs. Genes encoding stYa family proteins are also present in the BGC of other funal RiPPs ( F-RiPPs ) , such as phomopsin A ( 8 ) ( Ding et al. 2016 ) and ictorins ( Kessler et al. 2020 ) , suggesting that they are common nzymes for post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) in F-RiPP iosynthesis ( Ozaki et al . 2023 ) . Two examples of the functional\nFigure 6. UstYa-mediated oxidative transformations in F-RiPP biosynthesis. ( a ) Chemical structures of F-RiPPs.

Considering that 7 and 8 share a 13-membered macrocyclic ether as a common scaffold, some of these ustYa homologues are suggested to be related to oxidative macrocyclization. The function of each homologue was analyzed by examining the metabolites that accumulated in the gene knock-out ( KO ) mutants of the producing strain ( Figure 6 b ) ( Sogahata et al. 2021 ) . The KO of the phomYa gene abolished the production of 8 and resulted in the accumulation of its deoxy derivatives. This observation indicated that PhomYa was responsible for hydroxylation of the tyrosine residue. Employing the same approaches, PhomYc, PhomYd, and PhomYe were shown to be involved in the desaturation of isoleucine, aspartic acid, and proline residues, respectively ( Sogahata et al. 2021 ) . The KO of the phomYb gene merely abolished the production of 8 and did not produce related metabolites. Based on the finding that PhomYb was closely related to UstYa in the sequence similarity network analysis, PhomYb and UstYa were assumed to be involved in the common cyclization process. The enzyme ( s ) responsible for the biosynthesis of the 2,3-dehydrovaline residue is ( are ) currently unknown. In addition to these oxidative transformations mediated by UstYa homologues, the biosynthesis of 8 involves another noncanonical enzyme, the tyrosinase-like protein PhomQ1. Tyrosinase is an enzyme containing 2 copper ions in its active\nite, and it catalyzes the oxidation of phenolic compounds to heir corresponding catechols and o -quinones ( S\u00e1nchez-Ferrer t al. 1995 ) . Gene KO experiments indicated that phomQ1 was nvolved in the chlorination of the tyrosine residue, demontrating a unique example of the functional diversification of he tyrosinase-like enzyme ( Sogahata et al. 2021 ) . At the current tage, the proteolytic pathway of the precursor and the reaction equence of PTMs remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is still hallenging to examine the biochemical analysis of these unique xidases.\nUstYa-mediated transformations are not limited to F-RiPP iosynthesis but are also involved in the biosynthesis of funal NRPs. In the BGC of cyclochlorotine ( 9 ) , three genes encodng UstYa homologues, cctP2 , cctO , and cctR , are present in the anking region of the NRPS gene cctN ( Schafhauser et al. 2016 ; iang et al. 2021 ) . Gene KO experiments and the heterologous xpression in A. oryzae unveiled CctP2, CctO, and CctR as reponsible for chlorination, the O -to- N acyl shift, and hydroxlation, respectively ( Figure 7 ) . Notably, co-expression with 2 ransporters\u2014the major facilitator superfamily transporter ctQ and the ATP-binding cassette transporter ( ABC-T ) CctS\u2014 as essential in exerting the function of a putative halogenase ctP2 in both the producing strain and the heterologous host A. ryzae . In the case of 9 , the reaction sequence of UstYa-mediated ransformations could be elucidated as follows. After isocycloine was synthesized by CctN, CctP2 catalyzed dichlorination to\nFigure 7.

CctO then converted 10 to 9 . Fially, CctR hydroxylated 9 to produce hydroxycyclochlorotine as n end product. These findings made CctP2, CctO, and CctR atractive targets for further biochemical characterization of UstYa amily proteins. onclusion and perspectives\nith the help of advances in genome-sequencing technologies, ioinformatic tools, and the development of host-vector sysems, a significant body of biosynthetic knowledge has been acumulated to date. Recent studies of our research group focusing n the oxidative transformations in the biosynthesis of fungal atural products have been summarized in this review. In most f the presented studies, the A. oryzae expression system has een used to reconstitute the biosynthetic pathway and characerization of individual enzymes. As described in the first secion of this review that summarized the strategy for refactoring he biosynthetic pathways, the HS-knock-in method employng CRISPR/Cas9 has enabled a reliable expression of exogenous enes in A. oryzae . This advantage has allowed scientists to avoid time-consuming screening of the transformants, thus accelerting the biosynthetic studies. Next, oxidative transformations y known types of enzymes such as cytochrome P450s have been ntroduced. Besides simple oxidations, unique transformations y these enzymes have contributed to the structural diversifiation of fungal natural products. Finally, functional analyses of stYa family proteins, which form an emerging class of putative xidases that have no sequence similarity to known enzymes, ave been described. In the biosynthesis of F-RiPPs and fungal RPs, UstYa homologues exhibit remarkable functional diversity hat is comparable to that of P450s and \u03b1KGDOs. Collectively, he presented studies expand the current knowledge about the tructural diversification of fungal natural products by oxidative nzymes. The identified enzymes would be good candidates as iocatalysts that can be used for the synthesis of natural and nnatural molecules by biosynthetic and chemoenzymatic ap-\nroaches. Mechanistic and structural characterization of the enymes, as well as an understanding of the cellular processes, ncluding primary metabolism, trafficking of biosynthetic interediates, and localization of proteins, will be of great imporance for the application of those biocatalysts to the production f complex natural products.\ncknowledgments\nhe studies described in this review were conducted at the Deartment of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. he author would like to thank all contributors to the presented orks, including the members of our research group and the col-\naborators.
