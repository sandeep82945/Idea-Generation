    "abstractText": "Poly(3-methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) (PMAPTAC) is a typical cationic water-soluble polyelectrolyte, which has been widely used in petroleum, papermaking, daily cosmetics and other fields in the form of an aqueous solution. However, the acid\u2013base and thermal stability of PMAPTAC in aqueous solution have not been reported yet, which hinders its further application in high-temperature and acid\u2013base environments. To address these deficiencies, the effects of temperature and pH of PMAPTAC with different intrinsic viscosities on its hydrolysis stability were investigated qualitatively and quantitatively, and the hydrolysis mechanism was studied. Firstly, the qualitative analysis showed that the apparent viscosity of the PMAPTAC solution decreased with hydrolysis time at different temperatures and pH. The higher the temperature and the lower the pH, the greater the viscosity loss of PMAPTAC. The quantitative analysis showed that the hydrolysis rate of the PMAPTAC sample solution increased with the increase in temperature and pH. In addition, the intrinsic viscosity of PMAPTAC samples had little effect on the hydrolytic stability of PMAPTAC. Secondly, by analyzing the viscosity curves at different pH and temperatures by Arrhenius analysis, the Arrhenius equations were found to be 1/\u03c4 = 200.34e\u02c6((\u221225.04)/RT), 1/\u03c4 = 9127.07e\u02c6((\u221238.90)/RT) and 1/\u03c4 = 4683.03e\u02c6((\u221239.89)/RT) for pH 3, pH 7 and pH 11, respectively. Thirdly, the hydrolysis rate of PDMC was the fastest under alkaline conditions. In addition, compared with PDMC, PMAPTAC had better hydrolysis stability under the same conditions. Finally, the mechanism of the hydrolyzed polymer was studied by FTIR and 13CNMR, which showed that the carbonyl group of PMAPTAC was hydrolyzed into a carboxyl group, and the small molecule (3-aminopropyl) trimethylammonium chloride was generated, while the ester group of PDMC was hydrolyzed into a carboxyl group, and choline chloride was released. The above results can provide a theoretical basis for the application of PMAPTAC in some high-temperature and acid\u2013base environments.",

Introduction\nPoly(3-methacrylamido propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) (PMAPTAC) is a typical cationic water-soluble polymer polyelectrolyte, which has been widely used in petroleum, textile printing and dyeing, papermaking, daily cosmetics and other fields. In these fields, PMAPTAC is often applied in the form of an aqueous solution, and its application performance is mostly related to the solution properties. Among them, the hydrolytic stability of PMAPTAC is one of the most important solution properties directly related to its various uses and functions. There have been many reports on the hydrolytic stability of water-soluble polymers, especially the hydrolytic properties of polyacrylamide (PAM) [1\u20135]. For example, in 1988, Kheradmand et al. [6] studied the hydrolysis of acrylamide\u2013acrylic acid copolymers via potentiometric titration as a function of pH and initial carboxylate content at high temperatures (75 \u25e6C~95 \u25e6C). The results showed that when pH < 8, the pH and the hydrolysis\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14142811 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811 2 of 18\nrate gradually increased with the progress of hydrolysis; when pH > 8, pH and the hydrolysis rate gradually decreased with the progress of hydrolysis. The experimental results confirmed the intramolecular catalysis by neighboring undissociated carboxylate groups for pH < 7 and the catalysis of OH\u2212 ions with autoretarded kinetics for 7 < pH < 11. In the same year, Moradi-Araghi et al. [7] found that the imide was the dominant hydrolysis product under acidic conditions [8], and the carboxylate was preferred under neutral and alkaline conditions, as determined via 13CNMR. However, only a few studies in the literature have reported on the hydrolysis of polyelectrolytes [9\u201312]. For example, in 1989, Aksberg et al. [10] investigated the alkaline hydrolysis of a copolymer of acrylamide and acryloyloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride P(AM-DAC) via polyelectrolyte titration and nitrogen analysis in buffered aqueous solutions at different pH ranges (3.5\u20138.5) and temperatures (22\u201350 \u25e6C). The results of 13CNMR analysis showed that choline chloride was released as the hydrolysis product. In addition, the rate of hydrolysis increased with the increase in pH and temperature. This work studied the hydrolytic stability of ester groups and provided a research method that can be used in this study. In 2005, Fernandez I J et al. [11] investigated the hydrolysis resistance of PMAPTAC and PAM by determining the intrinsic viscosity using a Contraves (LS-30) low shear rotational rheometer at 25 \u25e6C. Polymer solutions (1%) were aged in an oven at 120 \u25e6C for 30 days after being prepared in NaCl (1M) and bubbled with nitrogen for 10 minutes. The results showed that a slight increase in the pH of PMAPTAC occurred with aging time, and PAM lost 90% of its initial intrinsic viscosity, while PMAPTAC lost only 20% of its initial intrinsic viscosity. Furthermore, the infrared spectra of polymers before and after aging did not show any particular changes that could indicate an important change in structure. This was an earlier report on the hydrolysis of PMAPTAC, but it only investigated the change in the intrinsic viscosity of the PMAPTAC solution with only one molecular weight during the aging time. It failed to investigate not only the effect of temperature, pH and molecular weight on the hydrolysis performance but also its hydrolysis mechanism. In 2019, Wu J Y et al. [12] studied the hydrolysis resistance of PMAPTAC hydrogel and poly[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride] (PDMC) hydrogel at 50 \u25e6C under acidic conditions by potentiometric titration. The results showed that the carboxyl group concentration of PDMC hydrogel reached 64.7 mmol/g but only 0.2 mmol/g for PMAPTAC hydrogel after 65 h, implying that the hydrolysis resistance of PMAPTAC was superior to that of PDMC. This paper was the earliest report on the comparative study of the hydrolytic stability of PMAPTAC and PDMC, but it only studied the hydrolysis performance of PMAPTAC and PDMC hydrogels with a single molecular weight at the same pH and temperature and failed to investigate the effects of temperature, pH and molecular weight on their hydrolysis performance, let alone the hydrolysis mechanism of PMAPTAC and PDMC. From the above literature, it can be seen that there have been only two literature reports on the hydrolytic stability of PMAPTAC samples with a single molecular weight, and the effects of temperature, molecular weight and pH on the hydrolysis performance of PMAPTAC have not been investigated yet, let alone its hydrolysis mechanism, which has led to a lack of comprehensive and profound understanding of the hydrolytic stability of PMAPTAC. Therefore, there is a very urgent need to study the hydrolysis properties and mechanism of PMAPTAC. In this work, firstly, the hydrolysis performance of PMAPTAC was qualitatively evaluated by measuring the apparent viscosity of sample solutions with different pH at different temperatures using a Brookfield DV2T rotational viscometer. Secondly, the hydrolysis rate of PMAPTAC was quantitatively measured by determining the total nitrogen of the hydrolyzate. Simultaneously, the hydrolytic stability of PDMC was compared with that of PMAPTAC. Finally, a preliminary description of the mechanism of polymer hydrolysis was obtained through the structural characterization of the polymer and the small molecules af-\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811 3 of 18\nter hydrolysis by infrared and 13CNMR analysis, which lays the foundation for the in-depth study of the structure, properties and applications of PMAPTAC.\n2.

Qualitative Determination of Hydrolysis\nThe polymer samples were weighed and dissolved in nitrogen-free water to bring their mass concentration to 10 g/L. Then, this solution was added to the above buffer solutions to dilute the mass concentration of the polymer to 1 g/L. After complete dissolution of the polymers in the buffer solutions, the solutions were transferred to glass vials, which were hermetically sealed with tape to prevent water vapor from escaping during heating. The vials containing the polymer solutions were subjected to aging temperatures of 30 \u25e6C, 55 \u25e6C and 80 \u25e6C. The solutions were removed from the heating system at previously\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811 4 of 18\nestablished time intervals, and then the viscosity of the solutions was immediately measured in the viscometer. The solutions were then returned to their respective vials, which were resealed and reheated. The apparent viscosity (\u03b7a) of polymer solutions was measured by a Brookfield DV2T rotational viscometer with a 1# rotor at 200 rpm at different pH and temperatures. To better assess changes in the \u03b7a of the polymer solutions over time, the viscosity was expressed as the viscosity retention rate of the solution (\u03b7%) [14], according to Equation (1). This was defined as the ratio between the viscosity percentage of the polymer solution at any aging time t (\u03b7t) and the initial \u03b7a of the same solution (\u03b7t = 0).\n\u03b7% = 100 \u00d7 \u03b7t \u03b70\n(1)\n2.4. Arrhenius Analysis\nAccording to the viscosity profiles of the polymer solutions from Section 2.3, viscosity decay constants were obtained for the polymers in solution by performing specific viscosity regression as a function of time [15], as shown in Equation (2).\n\u2212t \u03c4\n= ln (\n\u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5sol \u00b50 \u2212 \u00b5sol\n) (2)\nwhere \u00b5t is the specific viscosity at time t, \u00b50 is the initial specific viscosity, \u00b5sol is the viscosity of the solvent, and \u03c4 is the viscosity decay constant (day). Based on the viscosity decay constants of the polymers for pH 3, pH 7 and pH 11 solutions, Arrhenius analysis was applied according to Equation (3), and the activation energy involved in the polymer degradation process in solution was determined [15].\n1 \u03c4 = Ae \u2212Ea RT (3)\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.314 J\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121), Ea is the activation energy (kJ.mol\u22121), A is the frequency factor, and T is the temperature (K). According to the viscosity decay constant \u03c4 and Equation (4), the apparent viscosity and stability of PMAPTAC polymer solutions as a function of temperature and time can be predicted [15].\n\u00b5\n\u00b50 = e\n\u2212t \u03c4 (4)\n2.5. Principle of Method for Determination of Hydrolysis Rate\nAccording to the hydrolysis mechanism of PAM [16\u201320] and the hydrolysis mechanism of the ester group [21,22], it was speculated that the structures of PMAPTAC and PDMC hydrolysis products are those shown in Figures 1 and 2, where R is a H or metal ion. Therefore, after hydrolysis, the polymer solution was dialyzed through a dialysis bag for a period of time. The nitrogen content generated by the hydrolysis of the polymer was determined according to the determination of total nitrogen in water by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion UV spectrophotometry [23], and then the number of moles of nitrogen generated by hydrolysis was calculated and divided by the number of moles of total nitrogen in the sample before hydrolysis. Then, the hydrolysis rate was obtained according to Equation (5):\nHydrolysis rate% = 100 \u00d7 nNt nN0\n(5)\nwhere nNt is moles of nitrogen generated by hydrolysis in time t, and nN0 is the total moles of nitrogen in the original sample before hydrolysis.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811 5 of 18\n2.6. Research Methods of Hydrolysis Mechanism\nIn order to obtain a preliminary description of the hydrolysis mechanism of PMAPTAC and PDMC, the dialyzed solution and the polymer in the dialysis bag were freeze-dried, and the obtained products were characterized by infrared and 13CNMR after dialysis with a dialysis bag against the polymer solution hydrolyzed for a certain period of time.\n3.

These results could provide a theoretical basis for the application of PMAPTAC in some high-temperature and acid\u2013base environments.\n(3) Quantitative analysis of PMAPTAC hydrolysis According to the determination method of the hydrolysis rate in Section 2.4 and the\nstandard curve in Section 3.1, the hydrolysis rate of the PMAPTAC sample solution was measured at 30, 55 and 80 \u25e6C and different pH as a function of time, and the results are shown in Figure 8.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811 8 of 18\nand pH 11 conditions were obtained, and then Equation (6) could be modified to Equations (6)\u2013(8) for pH 3, pH 7 and pH 11, respectively. 1\ud835\udf0f = 200.34e .

Effects of pH and T on hydrolysis rate of PMAPTAC solution.\nIt can be seen in Figure 8 that under the same pH conditions, the hydrolysis rate of the PMAPTAC solution increased with the increase in temperature. For example, for pH 11, the hydrolysis rates at 30 \u00b0C, 55 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C after 96 days were 5.88%, 8.32% and 21.27%, respectively. According to the Arrhenius formula [24\u201326], the higher the temperature, the faster the reaction rate and the greater the hydrolysis rate. At the same temperature, the hydrolysis rate of PMAPTAC was higher under alkaline conditions; for example, at 80 \u00b0C, the hydrolysis rates at pH 3, pH 7 and pH 11 for 96 d were 9.73%, 6.19% and 21.27%, respectively. It can be seen that the hydrolysis rate under alkaline conditions was higher than that under acidic conditions, which is consistent with the results in the literature [6]. This may be because the PMAPTAC molecular chain is positively charged, and the mutual repulsion of the same charge with H+ prevented H+ from effectively undergoing nucleophilic addition to the protonated amide carbonyl [27\u201329], resulting in weaker hydrolysis, and finally, the hydrolysis rate of PMAPTAC was lower under acidic conditions. Moreover, it was found that under alkaline conditions, the hydrolysis rate gradually decreased with the progress of hydrolysis, because the OH\u2212 ion was the catalyst when the amide was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions. As the hydrolysis proceeded, the classical repulsion of hydroxide ions by carboxylate anions generated after hydrolysis reduced the concentration of available hydroxide ions near the amide group [6]. Therefore, under alkaline conditions, the catalytic effect of OH\u2212 was reduced, resulting in a gradual\nFigure 8.

For example, for pH 11, the hydrolysis rates at 30 \u25e6C, 55 \u25e6C and 80 \u25e6C after 96 days were 5.88%, 8.32% and 21.27%, respec ively.

Moreover, it was found that under alkaline conditions, the hydrolysis rate gradually decreased with the progress of hydrolysis, because the OH\u2212 ion was the catalyst when the amide was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions. As the hydrolysis proceeded, the classical repulsion of hydroxide ions by carboxylate anions generated after hydrolysis reduced the concentration of available hydroxide ions near the amide group [6]. Therefore, under alkaline conditions, the catalytic effect of OH\u2212 was reduced, resulting in a gradual slowing of the reaction rate as the hydrolysis proceeded; that is, there was a pronounced s lf-retardation effect. As ca also be seen in the li erature [6], the hydrolysis d grees of PAM at 80 \u25e6C and pH 3.75, 7.55 and 11.84 were 33%, 12% and 60% after 15 days of hydrolysis, respectively, while the hydrolysis degrees of PMAPTAC after 15 days were 3.74%, 2.77% and 16.19%, respectively, as shown in Figure 8. Thus, it can be concluded that PMAPTAC had good hydrolytic stability compared with PAM. This may be because N-alkyl mono- or di-substitution can significantly improve the hydrolysis resistance of AM chain segments [29,30].\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811 9 of 18\n3.2.2.

Figure 12 shows that the hydrolysis rates were 17.97%, 7.81% and 67.03%, respectively, indicating that the hydrolysis rate of PDMC was the fastest under alkaline conditions. This is because the ester bonds of PDMC molecules are more sensitive to alkaline hydrolysis [2,8]. Furthermore, the curve of the influence of time on the hydrolysis rate was fitted and analyzed; the composite exponential decreasing fitting equation was obtained as y =\nFigure 11.

It can be seen that the hydr lysis of PDMC under alk line cond tions gradually decreased with aging time. This may be because the repulsion of hydroxide ions by carboxylate anions generated after hydrolysis reduced the concentration of available hydroxide ions near the ester group. Finally, compared with PMAPTAC, PDMC had a higher hydrolysis rate, indicating that the hydrolysis resistance of PMAPTAC was superior to that of PDMC.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811 11 of 18\n3.4.

PMAPTAC solutions hydrolyzed at different pH at 80 \u00b0C for 100 days were dialyze thr ugh a dialysis bag, and the hydrolyzed product and the original PMAPTAC sample were characterized by FTIR. The results are shown in Figure 13.\nFigure 13. FTIR spectra of the original PMAPTAC and the hydrolyzed product after hydrolysis.\nIt can be seen in Figure 13 that, first, the C-H stretching vibration absorption peak of methyl and methylene in the polymer chains is found at 2800-3000 cm\u22121. The peaks at 950 cm\u22121 and 1474 cm\u22121 are N+(CH3)3 and methyl stretching vibration peaks on quaternary ammonium, respectively [30], and the absorption peak at 1630 cm\u22121 is assigned to the stretching vibration of C = O in PMAPTAC. The stretching vibration at 1202 cm\u22121 is the C-N stretching vibration of C-N+(CH3)3 [31\u201333]. Secondly, when comparing the spectra of the original PMAPTAC sample and the sample after hydrolysis, the spectrum of the sample after hydrolysis at pH 3 is basically the same as that of the original PMAPTAC sample, and no carboxyl group-related absorption vibration peaks are observed, which may be because the degree of hydrolysis of PMAPTAC under acidic conditions was low, as shown in Figure 8; its degree of hydrolysis was only 9.73%, and possibly, the carboxyl group generated by hydrolysis had a low concentration that was difficult to detect with the infrared spectrometer. Finally, as can be seen in the sample spectra (c, b) after hydrolysis at pH 7 and pH 11, new absorption peaks at 1567 cm\u22121 and 1426 cm\u22121 are observed in the spectra of the samples after hydrolysis, which are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxyl-COO- [34], which indicates that in pH 7 and pH\nIt can be seen in Figure 13 that, first, the C-H stretching vibration absorption peak of\nmethyl and methylene in the polymer chains is found at 2800\u20133000 cm\u22121.

Structural Characterization of Small Molecules Released by PMAPTAC Hydrolysis\nThe hydrolyzed PMAPTAC solution was treated in a dialysis bag after being heated at pH 3 and 80 \u00b0C, and the dialyzed solution was freeze-dried. Then, the structure was characterized by FTIR and 13CNMR. The results are shown in Figure 14.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811 12 of 18\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811 12 of 18\n11 solutions, the amide bond in the molecular structure of PMAPTAC was hydrolyzed into a carboxyl group.\n3.4.2.

Then, the structure was characterized by FTIR and 13CNMR. The results are shown in Figure 14.\nFigure 14. Infrared (a) and 13CNMR (b) spectra of small molecules after PMAPTAC hydrolysis.\nFrom the infrared spectrum in Figure 14, it can be seen that the peaks at 957 cm\u22121 and 1479 cm\u22121 are N+(CH3)3 and methyl stretching vibration peaks on quaternary ammonium, respectively [30], and the stretching vibration at 1204 cm\u22121 is the C-N stretching vibration of C-N+(CH3)3 [31\u201333]. The 2472 cm\u22121 peak is attributed to the absorption peak of ammonium salt, which may be due to the interaction of HCl and primary amine-NH2 on the small molecule generated by the hydrolysis of the amide bond. In addition, it can be seen in the carbon spectrum in Figure 14 that 54.68 ppm is attributed to the peak of the primary carbon atom in the methyl group of N+(CH3)3, and 65.88 ppm, 46.32 ppm and 23.33 ppm are the peaks of the secondary carbon atom in the propyl group. Therefore, the amide bond of PMAPTAC was hydrolyzed into a carboxyl group, and the small molecule (3- aminopropyl)trimethylammonium chloride was released.\n3.4.3. Hydrolysis Mechanism Description of PMAPTAC (1) The acid-catalyzed pathway According to the above results and the literature [16\u201320], the acid catalysis mecha-\nnism of PMAPTAC is shown in Figure 15. The carbonyl carbon atom has a certain positive charge, while the oxygen atom on the carbonyl group has a certain negative charge. Due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon atoms and oxygen atoms, the \u03c0 and \u03c3 bonds on the carbonyl group are distorted, and the \u03c0 bond also has a certain dipole moment, so the oxygen atom will be partially negatively charged. Eventually, the carbonyl group becomes very vulnerable to attack by hydrogen ions. The detailed hydrolysis process is as follows.\nThe protonation is commonly believed to occur at the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group after the addition of a proton to the amide (from A0 to A1) [27,35,36]. Then, the protonated amide A1 is the subject of a nucleophilic attack by the oxygen atom of an adjacent water molecule. This water molecule dissociates into OH- and H+ when an OH group is added to A1 [28,37]. The excess proton migrates to the solvent in a series of proton-transfer reactions [29,38\u201340]. Then, the nitrogen atom of the intermediate A2 is protonated, which may be carried out either by excess protons from the water phase or by dissociation of a water molecule [28,37]. Finally, the C-N bond of A3 is broken, resulting in the carboxylic acid A4 and the (3-aminopropyl) trimethylammonium chloride A5, accompanied by the deprotonation of the OH group.\nFig 4. Infrared (a) nd 13CNMR (b) spectra of small molecules after PMAPTAC hydrolysis.\nFrom the infrared spectrum in Figure 14, it can be seen that the peaks at 957 cm\u22121 and 1479 cm\u22121 are N+(CH3)3 and methyl stretching vibration peaks on quaternary ammonium, respectively [30], and the stretching vibration at 1204 cm\u22121 is the C-N stretching vibration of C-N+(CH3)3 [31\u201333]. The 2472 cm\u22121 peak is attributed to the absorption peak of ammonium salt, which may be due to the interaction of HCl and primary amin -NH2 on the sm ll molecule generated by the hydrolysis of the amide bond. In addition, it can be seen in the carbon spectrum in Figure 14 that 54.68 ppm is attributed to the peak of the primary carbon atom in the methyl group of N+(CH3)3, and 65.88 ppm, 46.32 ppm and 23.33 ppm are the peaks of the secondary carbon atom in the propyl group. Therefore, the amide bond of PMAPTAC was hydrolyzed into a carboxyl group, and the small molecule (3- aminopropyl)trimet ylammonium chloride was released.\n3.4.3. Hydrolysis Mechanism Description of PMAPTAC\n(1) The acid-catalyzed pathway According to the above results and the literature [16\u201320], the acid catalysis mechanism\nof PMAPTAC is shown in Figure 15. The carbonyl carbon atom has a certain positive charge, w ile the oxygen atom on the carbonyl group has a certain negative charge. Due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon atoms and oxygen atoms, the \u03c0 and \u03c3 bonds on the carbonyl group are distorted, and the \u03c0 bond also has a certain dipole moment, so the oxygen atom will be partially negatively charged. Eventually, the carbonyl group becomes very vulnerable to attack by hydrogen ions. The detailed hydrolysis process is as follows. The protonation is commonly believed to occur at the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group after the addition of a proton to the amide (from A0 to A1) [27,35,36]. Then, the protonated amide A1 is the subject of a nucleophilic attack by the oxygen atom of an adjacent water molecule. This water molecule dissociates into OH\u2212 and H+ when an OH group is added to A1 [28,37]. The excess proton migrates to the solvent in a series of proton-transfer reactions [29,38\u201340]. Then, the nitrogen atom of the intermediate A2 is protonated, which may be carried out either by excess protons from the water phase or by dissociation of a water molecule [28,37]. Finally, the C-N bond of A3 is broken, resul ing in the carboxylic acid A4 nd the (3-aminopropyl) trimethylammonium chloride A5, accompanied by the deprotonation of the OH group.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 2811 13 of 18 Polymers 2022, 14, 2811 13 of 18\nFigure 15. Acid-catalyzed amide hydrolysis mechanism of PMAPTAC.\n(2) The base-catalyzed pathway According to the above results and the literature [16\u201320], the base-catalyzed hydrol-\nysis mechanism of PMAPTAC is shown in Figure 16. Due to the difference in electronegativity between carbon and oxygen atoms, the \u03c0 and \u03c3 bonds on the carbonyl are distorted, and the \u03c3 bond also has a certain dipole moment, which will give a partial positive charge to the carbonyl carbon. The detailed hydrolysis process is as follows. Base-catalyzed amide hydrolysis is initiated by the nucleophilic attack of an OH- ion on the carbon atom of the amide group [41] (from B0 to B1). The intermediate B1 is negatively charged and exhibits a basic character under base conditions, which may induce the dissociation of a solvent water molecule; then, the intermediate B2 is generated through protonation of the nitrogen atom, releasing the solvated OH- ion. In principle, breaking the C-N bond in B2 is possible, but the strongly favored reaction is the deprotonation of the OH group of B2 by an OH- ion, generating the intermediate B3, the C-N bond of which is broken at much lower energy [41]. Finally, the carboxylic acid B4 and the (3-aminopropyl) trimethylammonium chloride B5 are generated by the dissociation of B3.\nFigure 15.

Secondly, the peak intensities (18.41 ppm, 35.70 ppm and 44.80 ppm) of the associated secondary, tertiary and quaternary carbon atoms in the main chain were basically unchanged [34], and finally, the peak intensities of the carbon atoms in the carbonyl group in the ester group (177.75 ppm) became weaker. The new peak at 186.68 ppm is attributed to the carbon atom in the carboxyl group [34]. It can also be seen in Figure 17 that the peaks at 950 and 1474 cm\u22121 are N+(CH3)3 and methyl stretching vibration peaks on quaternary ammonium, respectively [30], and the absorption peak at 1720 cm\u22121 is attributed to the stretching vibration of C=O in PDMC [42,43]. By comparing the spectra of the original PDMC sample and the sample after hydrolysis at 80 \u25e6C and pH 11, it can be seen that after hydrolysis, the peaks at 950 cm\u22121 and 1478 cm\u22121 related to quaternary ammonium salts disappeared or weakened, while the peak at 1720 cm\u22121 related to esters also disappeared. In particular, new or significantly enhanced absorption peaks appeared at 1548 cm\u22121 and 1378 cm\u22121, which are attributed to the asymmetry and symmetry of carboxyl-COO- stretching vibration [34]. Therefore, during the alkaline hydrolysis process of PDMC, the ester group in the molecule was hydrolyzed into the carboxyl group.\n3.5.2.

Structural Characterization of Small Molecules Released from PDMC Hydrolysis After the hydrolyzed PDMC solution was treated in a dialysis bag, the dialyzed solution was freeze-dried, and then the structure was characterized by FTIR. The result is shown in Figure 18.\nFigure 18. FTIR spectra of small molecules released by PDMC hydrolysis.\nFigure 18 shows that the peaks at 950 cm\u22121 and 1475 cm\u22121 are N+(CH3)3 and methyl stretching vibration peaks on quaternary ammonium, respectively [30], and the stretching vibration at 1078 cm\u22121 is the CH2CH2-O stretching vibration. It can be seen that the FTIR spectra of the small molecules after hydrolysis of PDMC are consistent with the spectra of choline chloride [30], thus proving that choline chloride was generated after PDMC hydrolysis. In summary, during the alkaline hydrolysis process of PDMC, when the ester group in the molecule was hydrolyzed, the small molecule choline chloride was generated, and the ester group of the side chain was hydrolyzed into a carboxyl group. This result is consistent with that reported in the literature [9,20]. The basic hydrolysis mechanism of PDMC is shown in Figure 19.\nFigure 18. FTIR spectrum of small molecules released by PDMC hydrolysis.\nFigure 18 shows that the peaks 1 and 1475 c \u22121 are N+(CH3)3 and methyl stretching vibration peaks on quaternary a monium, respectively [30], and the stretching vibration at 1078 cm\u22121 is the CH2CH2-O s retching vibration. It can be seen that the FTIR spectrum of the small molecules after hydrolysis of PDMC are consistent wit the spectrum of choline chloride [30], thus proving t at choline chloride was gener ted after PDMC hydrolysis. In summary, during the alkaline hydrolysis process of PDMC, when the ester group in the molecule as hydrolyzed, the s all molecule choline chloride was generated, and the ester group of the side chain was hydrolyzed into a carboxyl group. This result is consistent with that reported in the literature [9,20].

Conclusions (1) Qualitative analysis showed that the apparent viscosity of PMAPTAC solution de-\ncreased with hydrolysis time at different temperatures and pH. The lower the pH and the higher the temperature, the greater the apparent viscosity loss of the PMAPTAC solution. Quantitative analysis showed that the hydrolysis rate of PMAPTAC sample solution increased with the increase in temperature and pH. For example, the hydrolysis rates over 96 d at 30\u2103, 55 \u2103 and 80 \u2103 at pH 11 were 5.88%, 8.32% and 22.07%, respectively. In addition, the hydrolysis rates of PMAPTAC samples with different [\u03b7] were not much different, indicating that [\u03b7] had little effect on the hydrolytic stability of PMAPTAC.\n(2) By analyzing the viscosity curves at different pH and temperatures by Arrhenius analysis, the Arrhenius equations for pH 3, pH 7 and pH 11 were 1/\u03c4 = 200.34e^((\u221225.04)/RT), 1/\u03c4 = 9127.07e^((\u221238.90)/RT) and 1/\u03c4 = 4683.03e^((\u221239.89)/RT), respectively. PMAPTAC solutions were projected to maintain at least half their original viscosity for over 11 days at pH 3, 21 days at pH 7, and 56 days at pH 11, which were predicted according to the formula. (3) The apparent viscosity of the PDMC polymer decreased with aging time. The viscosity retention rates were 50.89%, 60.17% and 44.40%, and the hydrolysis rates of PDMC solution were 17.97%, 7.81% and 67.03% in pH 3, pH 7 and pH 11 solutions after 96 d at 55 \u2103, respectively, indicating that the hydrolysis rate of PDMC was the fastest under alkaline conditions. In contrast, PMAPTAC had significantly superior hydrolytic stability under the same conditions (4) The mechanism of the hydrolyzed polymer was studied by FTIR and 13 CNMR, which showed that the carbonyl group of PMAPTAC in solution was hydrolyzed into a carboxyl group, and the small molecule (3-aminopropyl) trimethylammonium chloride was generated, while the ester group of PDMC was hydrolyzed into the carboxyl group, and choline chloride was released. The above results can provide a theoretical basis for the application of PMAPTAC in some high-temperature and acid\u2013base environments.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.Z. and Y.W.; methodology, Y.Z. and Y.W.; software, Y.W.; validation, Y.W. and X.J.; formal analysis, Y.Z.; investigation, Y.W.; resources, Y.W.; data curation, Y.Z.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.Z.; X.J.; visualization, Y.W.; supervision, Y.Z.; project administration, Y.Z.; funding acquisition, Y.Z.
