ABSTRACT Objectives This study examined the effects of workrelated electronic communication (WREC) during nonworking hours in the work from home or office setting on health. Methods The study recruited 98 information technology workers in a 9day observational study. They recorded work\u2013life events (eg, work style (working mostly from home or the office) and duration of WREC during nonworking hours) and subjective ratings (eg, current fatigue, sleepiness and depression) and wore a sleep actigraph to measure objective sleep variables before bedtime every day. They completed the Brief Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVTB) before bedtime for 4 days. Results The frequency of WREC was significantly higher when working mostly from home than in the office (p<0.01). In addition, the duration of WREC was longer when working mostly from home than in the office (p<0.001). Linear or generalised linear mixed model analysis for fatigue, depression and PVT lapse revealed significant interaction effects between work style and WREC (all p<0.05). Post hoc analysis showed that the longer the WREC, the worse the fatigue and depression and the lower the lapse on working mostly from the office (all p<0.05). Conclusions Longer WREC is associated with worse fatigue and depression and lower lapse of PVT (higher alertness) before bedtime for working mostly from the office. Workers, especially those working from the office, should minimise WREC during nonworking hours to maintain good health. Therefore, companies, managers and other relevant stakeholders should refrain from contacting workers during nonworking hours.",

Published by BMJ.\nINTRODUCTION Use of work- related electronic communications (WREC; eg, email, telephone and messaging application software) during non- working hours is associated with health problems.1\u20134 For example, Arlinghaus and Nachreiner2 reported that the risk of health problems, such as musculoskeletal, psychological, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular, was higher in workers with work- related contact (eg, email or telephone) during non- working hours. Non- working hours include sleep and\nleisure times,5 which are important for recovery from work- related fatigue.3 6 WREC during nonworking hours may directly reduce sleep and leisure times and, thus, interrupt this recovery. In addition, WREC during non- working hours interrupts psychological detachment from work,3 which also contributes to recovery from fatigue.7 Therefore, WREC during non- working hours may directly and indirectly negatively impact recovery from workrelated fatigue, and accumulated fatigue may lead to various health impairments.\nIn recent years, the work from home setting, referring to work that fully or partly takes place within the worker\u2019s own home,8 has been rapidly and widely implemented after the outbreak of COVID- 19.8 9 Previous review articles reported that although it has a few advantages, such as saving commute time and increasing sleep duration, working from home also has disadvantages, such as increasing sitting time, inducing feelings of\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC \u21d2 Work- related electronic communication (WREC) during non- working hours is associated with health problems, but the effects of the interaction between WREC and work style (working from home or office) on worker health remain unclear.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS \u21d2 Although the frequency of WREC was significantly higher when working mostly from home than when working mostly from office, a negative impact of WREC, that is, the effect where the longer the WREC, the worse the fatigue and depression and higher alertness before bedtime, was observed when working mostly from office but not when working mostly from home.\nHOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY\n\u21d2 Promotion of the right to disconnect may reduce WREC during non- working hours and health impairments due to WREC.\non January 9, 2024 by guest.

However, ICT can also provide links to work during nonworking hours. For example, Arlinghaus and Nachreiner2 found that 38% of 22 686 workers were contacted through WREC (eg, email or telephone) during non- working hours during the previous year. Therefore, WREC during non- working hours may be more likely to occur when working from home. Moreover, the interaction between WREC during non- working hours and working from home, which lead to the deterioration of psychological detachment from work,3 10 may cause more significant impairments on health. Conversely, working from home, which can save commute time and ensure sleep and leisure times for recovery from fatigue,10 11 may reduce negative health effects due to WREC during non- working hours. However, the effects of the interaction between WREC and work style (working from home or office) on worker health remain unclear.\nTo fill the gap, this study examined the effects of the interaction between WREC and work style on the health of Japanese daytime workers. The present study conducted a survey on workers under the \u2018Information and communications\u2019 industrial classification, which held the highest percentage in the rate of telework adoption by industry in Japan.9 The study tested the hypotheses that follow. The results of testing the hypotheses could provide novel knowledge regarding the effects of WREC during non- working hours on worker health. Hypothesis 1: WREC during non- working hours is more frequent and longer for working from home than working from office. Hypothesis 2: the longer the duration of WREC during non- working hours, the greater the health risks. Hypothesis 3: the magnitude of health risks due to WREC duration during non- working hours varies across working styles."

The company sent invitations to 22 642 registrants, of whom 7533 accessed the survey website produced by the company. Participants were excluded using the following criteria: (a) those aged <20 or >59 years old; (b) those working less than 35 hours/week; (c) those who were shift or night workers; (d) those with a second job; (e) those with non- permanent employment (eg, part- time or temporarily employed); (f) the industry type was not under \u2018Information and Communications\u2019; (g) those who never received WREC during non- working hours; and (h) those who responded inappropriately to the instruction manipulation check.12 We also asked about the frequency of working from home and office (the question had five response options: (1) working from the office every day, (2) working from office is more frequent than working from home, (3) working from home and office occurred with the same frequency, (4) working from home is more frequent than working from office and (5) working from home every day). We then recruited 50 employees for each work style (working from the office (1 and 2) and working from home (4 and 5), online supplemental table 1). The first 100 registrants who agreed to participate in the 9- day observational study and who met the exclusion criteria and classification were included in the study."

Within this period, the participants recorded their work\u2013life events (eg, work style and duration of WREC during non- working hours) and subjective ratings before bedtime every day. They wore an actigraph to measure objective sleep variables every night. In addition, they completed the Brief Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT- B13) before bedtime on 7 November (Sunday), 8 November (Monday), 12 November (Friday) and 14 November (Sunday). Recording of subjective work\u2013life events and PVT was conducted by a fatigue checker14 15 on the smartphones of the participants. To reduce missing data, we sent a reminder email to the participants every day. After the observation period, participants completed a poststudy survey regarding their characteristics."

Work style was dichotomised into working mostly from home (1 and 2) and office (3 and 4, online supplemental table 1). The question on WREC gathered data on the duration (minutes) of WREC during non- working hours for each of the following media: telephone, email, application software with read receipts, application software without read receipts and video communication. WREC was then calculated as the sum of the time spent on these methods during non- working hours. Affective valence regarding WREC was assessed using a 7- point Likert- type scale (0=very negative, 7=very positive). If WREC occurred several times, then the participants reported affective valence regarding the overall WREC of the day."

Therefore, data for 430 person- days were obtained. Of these, 53.3% (229 persondays) were working mostly from the office, and 46.7% (201) were working mostly from home (online supplemental table 1).

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The present study examined the interaction effects between WREC during non- working hours and work style on health. The results showed that (1) the frequency of WREC was significantly higher and that the duration of WREC was significantly longer for working mostly from home than for working mostly from the office, (2) the longer the WREC, the worse the fatigue and depression and the lower the lapse before bedtime after working mostly from the office and (3) the longer the video, email and telephone communication during non- working hours, the worse the fatigue, the lower the lapse and the worse the psychological detachment before bedtime, respectively.\nWREC during non- working hours was more frequent and longer for working mostly from home than for working mostly from the office, which supports hypothesis 1. Working from home is a work style that uses ICT, and in this environment, WREC using ICT may be more likely to occur during working hours and non- working hours. This study also found that WREC during non- working hours reduced worker health, as was found in previous studies.1\u20133 In response, several countries have legislated a \u2018right to disconnect\u2019, which is \u2018a worker\u2019s right to be able to disengage from work and refrain from engaging in WREC, such as emails or other messages, during non- working hours\u2019.25 The right to disconnect may reduce WREC during non- working hours and health impairment due to WREC. However, Japan and many other countries have not legislated the right to disconnect so far. Except in certain industries or emergency situations, minimising WREC during non- working hours would be beneficial to worker health.\nAs the WREC became longer, psychological detachment became worse. These results support hypothesis 2 and are consistent with the findings of previous studies.3 In addition, the longer the WREC, the worse the fatigue and depression and the lower the PVT lapse before bedtime when working mostly from the office but not when working mostly from home. PVT performance reflects behavioural alertness, and total and chronic partial sleep deprivation deteriorated PVT performance.26 This finding indicated that workers with longer WREC during nonworking hours after working mostly from the office experience high levels of fatigue, depression and alertness before bedtime. These results partially support hypothesis 3. These results were adjusted for the emotion regarding WREC as a covariate and indicated that an increase in WREC duration leads to worsened fatigue and depression and increased alertness regardless of emotional valence (positive or negative) about WREC content.\non January 9, 2024 by guest.

Occup Environ Med 2023;0:1\u20138. doi:10.1136/oemed-2023-108962\nHigh arousal levels before bedtime lead to a deterioration in sleep quality,27 28 which may deteriorate the sleep function of recovery from fatigue. Conversely, the study found no significant main effects or interaction for objective sleep variables. This study did not ask whether WREC was received during sleep. The participants could have received WREC after reporting subjective work\u2013life events (ie, during sleep). WREC, especially telephone calls, during sleep can increase WASO and deteriorate sleep quality. Therefore, further studies are required to elucidate this issue.\nAlternatively, the study observed no significant effect of WREC on fatigue, depression and PVT lapse for working mostly from home, and the reason is unclear. A possibility is that working from home blurs the boundaries between work and private life compared with working from the office.10 Meanwhile, working from the office has clear boundaries between work and private life locationally, and if those who work from the office receive WREC during non- working hours, they may feel that it interrupts their private life, which may lead to adverse effects. In addition, 23.5% of participants who were working mostly from home for all workdays may have used the WREC with ICT more frequently and for longer periods during working hours, such\nthat they may have become accustomed to WREC. This habituation to WREC may have reduced the negative effects of WREC during non- working hours.\nRegarding the methods for WREC, the longer the email communication during non- working hours, the lower the number of PVT lapses before bedtime. Email communication requires a digital device such as a computer, smartphone or tablet and necessitates looking at a bright screen. Blue light, which is emitted by these devices, increases alertness,29 which may increase arousal levels before bedtime and lead to the decrease in PVT lapse. In addition, the longer the telephone communication during non- working hours is, the worse the psychological detachment from work before bedtime will be. This result was consistent with those of previous studies.3 Telephone communication during non- working hours reduces the leisure time needed to recover from fatigue and deteriorates psychological detachment from work; these outcomes may lead to restriction of recovery from fatigue. Furthermore, the longer that video communication continues during non- working hours, the worse the fatigue before bedtime becomes. Intensive and/ or inappropriate use of videoconferencing tools causes somatic and cognitive exhaustion, as well as the so- called Zoom fatigue\nFigure 1 Effects of work style (working mostly from home or the office) and work- related electronic communication (WREC) during non- working hours on subjective ratings (fatigue, depression, sleepiness and psychological detachment) before bedtime adjusted for sex, age, round- trip commute time and valence to WREC.

They reported that many cases featured long working hours and aspects such as tight deadlines and dealing with clients. Furthermore, a survey on industrial safety and health conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan35 reported that 26.7% (n=7831) of offices had workers who took leave for mental health problems of more than 1 month during the most recent year; this was the second highest ratio among all industries in Japan.

This study found that WREC during nonworking hours was associated with fatigue and depression when working mostly from the office, and continuous WREC during non- working hours may be associated with mental health problems. Therefore, WREC during non- working hours should be minimised in the information and communications industry and in all industries.\nThis study has its limitations. First, it focused on information technology workers who frequently conduct working from home.9 They may frequently use ICT in their daily work and may be relatively familiar with using WREC with ICT. However, whether or not similar results can be obtained in other types of industry remains unclear. Second, in this study, 47% of the participants varied their work styles on a daily basis. Studies using a cross- over design or intervention studies are required to further clarify the effects of WREC. Third, in this study, PVT and self- reporting (work style, WREC and subjective ratings) were measured using participants\u2019 use of smartphones before bedtime. Although we used the short version of PVT (3 min), use of digital devices may have affected sleep variables. Fourth, this study did not calculate the target sample size before conducting screening; therefore, significant main effects and/or interactions may not be present due to lack of statistical power.\nIn conclusion, this study examined the effects of WREC during non- working hours on health after working from home or office. The results demonstrated that the longer the WREC, the worse the fatigue and depression and the lower the PVT lapse before bedtime after working mostly from office. Especially, longer telephone, video and email communication during non- working hours led to worse psychological detachment and fatigue and lower lapse before bedtime. Sleep provides recovery from fatigue, but high levels of fatigue, depression and alertness before bedtime may influence sleep quality and reduce the positive effects. Therefore, WREC during non- working hours, especially for those working mostly from office, should be minimised if possible.\nContributors HI and TK conceived and designed the study.
