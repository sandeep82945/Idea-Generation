    "abstractText": "This work presents the synthesis of a new representative of hemicurcuminoids with a nonyloxy substituent (HCur) as a fluorescent amphiphilic structural element of vesicular aggregates based on phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), and 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA). Both X-ray diffraction analysis of the single crystal and 1H NMR spectra of HCur in organic solvents indicate the predominance of the enol-tautomer of HCur. DFT calculations show the predominance of the enol tautomer HCur in supramolecular assemblies with PC, PS, and PCDA molecules. The results of the molecular modeling show that HCur molecules are surrounded by PC and PS with a rather weak exposure to water molecules, while an exposure of HCur molecules to water is enhanced under its supramolecular assembly with PCDA molecules. This is in good agreement with the higher loading of HCur into PC(PS) vesicles compared to PCDA vesicles converted into polydiacetylene (PDA) ones by photopolymerization. HCur molecules incorporated into HCur-PDA vesicles exhibit greater planarity distortion and hydration effect in comparison with HCur-PC(PS) ones. HCur-PDA is presented as a dual fluorescence-chromatic nanosensor responsive to a change in pH within 7.5\u20139.5, heavy metal ions and polylysine, and the concentration-dependent fluorescent response is more sensitive than the chromatic one. Thus, the fluorescent response of HCur-PDA allows for the distinguishing between Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions in the concentration range 0\u20130.01 mM, while the chromatic response allows for the selective sensing of Pb2+ over Cd2+ ions at their concentrations above 0.03 mM.",

The uses of colorimetric and luminescence techniques for sensing are particularly attractive since they can facilitate the naked-eye or simple spectroscopic detection of biomolecules or water-soluble toxicants [6\u201311]. The development of sensory systems on the basis of supramolecular assemblies requires structure optimization on both molecular and supramolecular levels. Curcumine and curcuminoid derivatives provide good basis for the development of sensors [12\u201317]. Moreover, synthetic modifications of curcuminoids and hemicurcuminoids allow an embedding of different functional groups into their molecules [18,19]. The resulting hemicurcumine HCur (also shown in Scheme 1) will be represented as a potential sensor\nPolymers 2023, 15, 714. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15030714 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 714 2 of 16\nfor the fluorescent monitoring of heavy metal ions and polyaminoacids. To overcome the poor water solubility of HCur, it has been incorporated into water-dispersible hydrophilic vesicular aggregates such as phospholipid vesicles and polydiacetylenic polymeric vesicular aggregates (PDAs), which are already documented as convenient nanoplatforms for the incorporation of luminophores, both organic [20] and complexed with metal ions [21\u201323].\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 11\nsupramolecular assemblies requires structure optimization on both molecular and supra-\nmolecular levels.\nCurcumine and curcuminoid derivatives provide good basis for the development of\nsensors [12\u201317].

Free energies of the generated species in solutions were calculated with the recently published CENSO protocol of Grimme et al. [43], designed for the evaluation of structure ensembles containing non-rigid molecules. The geometries were optimized with the r2SCAN-3c [44] composite density functional in their respective solutions using the DCOSMO-RS [45] implicit solvation model, whereby interactions\nPolymers 2023, 15, 714 4 of 16\nwith the environment are already considered from the beginning. Solvation contributions \u03b4Gsolv to the free energy at 298.15 K were obtained with COSMO-RS [46,47] using the BP_TZVP_C30_1601.ctd parameterization in combination with the energy and density of the high-level single-point calculation. The thermostatistical contributions to the free energy were obtained by single-point hessian (SPH) calculations [48] within the framework of the modified rigid-rotor-harmonic-oscillator statistical treatment (\u2206GmRRHO) [49,50] at the GFN2-xTB [51] /ALPB [52] level, where GFN2-xTB is the robust and fast semiempirical quantum chemical method and ALPB is the robust and efficient implicit solvation model for fast semiempirical methods. The final free energies were obtained from \u2206G = \u2206E(r2SCAN-3c) + \u2206GmRRHO(GFN2-xTB/ALPB) + \u2206\u03b4Gsolv(COSMO-RS). The most stable conformers of each tautomer, revealed on the basis of computed \u2206G values, were used in the computation of UV-Vis spectra. Time-dependent density functional response theory (TD-DFT) [53\u201355] has been employed to compute the vertical excitation energy (i.e., absorption wavelengths) and oscillator strength on the ground state geometries optimized within the framework of the CENSO protocol as described above. For this purpose, the PBE0 function [56] in combination with the Ahlrichs\u2019 triple-\u03b6 def2-TZVP AO basis set [57\u201359] was used. The same conformers were further used as starting structures to generate clusters of these species explicitly solvated by PC or PCDA molecules. Clusters are generated by the Quantum Cluster Growth (QCG) algorithm [60,61] which, in short, adds solvent molecules around the solute at energetically favorable positions using an intermolecular force field docking algorithm (xTB-IFF) [20]. The cluster-generation step is followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the use of the recently developed general force field GFN-FF [62]. Equilibrated snapshots from the trajectory are fully geometry-optimized at the GFN2-xTB level, forming an ensemble of low-energy clusters. The dynamical behavior of the clusters of the lowest free energy (i.e., including thermostatistical corrections) was further studied within the framework of the MD approach. MD trajectories of 1200 ps were carried out with the use of a generic all-atomic force field GFN-FF. All DFT and TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the Turbomole-7.5.1 program package [63]."

Aldol condensation and the subsequent destruction of the boron complex, achieved by its treatment of boiling in MeOH with the addition of TEA in the case of HCur-BF2, leads to the formation of target hemicurcuminoid (HCur). The obtained compounds were characterized by the elemental analyses, NMR and MS techniques. According to 1H NMR data, the compound HCur in DMSO-d6 solution at a concentration of 0.03 M is found in enol form (>99%). The structure of HCur was finally established by a single crystal X-ray crystallography of the separated crystal grown from the DMSO-d6 (Figure 1a). Compound HCur belongs to the monoclinic system, space group C2/c (Table S2). The crystal consists only of hemicurcuminoid 3 molecules, which are in enol form as well as in DMSO-d6 solution. This form is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group and the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group [O3-H3\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O1 (2.4736(15) \u00c5] (Figure 1b).

UV-Vis spectra were simulated for the most stable conformers of each tautomer (Figure 3a), revealed on the basis of their computed free energies. The TD-DFT simulated spectrum of keto tautomer contains two strong bands in the spectral interval ~300\u2013450 nm, while only one band at ~390 nm is registered in the UV-Vis spectra of solutions.

Thus, the enolic form of HCur predominates in the mixed vesicles, although the location of HCur molecules within the PC- and PCDA-based bilayers is quite different, which is reflected, e.g., in different exposures of the molecules to the hydrated exterior layer. This can be a reason for the different spectral patterns of HCur in the PDA- and PC(PS)based vesicles, although possible translocations of HCur molecules within the PDA-bilayer during photopolymerization of HCur-PCDA vesicles cannot be excluded. Moreover, the experimentally observed smaller loading extent of HCur into PDA- in comparison with\nPolymers 2023, 15, 714 8 of 16\nPC(PS)-based vesicles agrees with the MD calculations revealing better compatibility of HCur with the phospholipids than with PCDA molecules reflected in more close contact of the dye with the former matrix than with the latter environment. The planarity of HCur molecules can be distorted when their R-substituents are incorporated into the hydrophobic layer of the vesicles, which may blue-shift the emission bands. The deprotonation of the enolic form of curcumine and curcuminoide derivatives is another reason for the changes in their emissive properties [65]. The phase transitions in the mixed bilayers should also be mentioned as the factor triggering a translocation of the dye molecules from the hydrophobic core of the PhL bilayers to their polar periphery, typically manifested by the changes in the dye spectra [66,67]. Finally, the aggregation of mixed vesicles can be considered as another factor affecting the luminescence of the HCur molecules included into the vesicular aggregates. The incorporation of the dye molecules into the phospholipid vesicles is the reason for the disturbing of the structural ordering in their hydrophobic layers, which can be followed by the enhanced aggregation of the mixed vesicles vs. their pure phospholipid counterparts [68]. The DLS data (Figure 4) measured for the aqueous solutions of the mixed vesicles reveal the average size values, which are greater than the previously reported values of the PC and PDA vesicles [69] and those of the PS vesicles measured in similar conditions (Figure S4). The size and polydispersity characteristics calculated from the DLS data (Table 1) indicate that the incorporation of HCur molecules into the PC-, PS- and PDA-based bilayers affects the size and stability of the mixed vesicular aggregates but does not cause significant aggregation of the mixed vesicles.

            "text": "The enolic forms of HCur molecules can undergo dissociation in specific pH conditions, followed by the enhancement of the lower energy emission [65]. The lack of detectable changes in the ratios of the intensities of the lower and higher energy transitions of HCurPDA or HCur-PC(PS) vesicles under the acidification of their aqueous dispersions to pH values below 7.5 (Figure S5a\u2013c) indicates the insignificant deprotonation of HCur molecules in the aforesaid conditions. The pH-dependence of the emission was analyzed through the intensity ratios measured for higher- and lower-energy bands (Ih/Il) at 474 and 555 nm, respectively, for HCur-PDA, and at 495 and 555 nm, respectively, for HCur-PC(PS). The Ih/Il values at various pHs are plotted in Figure 4a. The results represented in Figure 4a indicate the insignificant changes under the alkalization of HCur-PC(PS) aqueous colloids to a pH above 8.5, while the ratios measured for HCur-PDA decrease under the alkalization. Similar to the PDA-vesicles themselves [70], the alkalization to pHs above 7.5 triggers the chromatic changes (Figure 4b) peculiar for the blue-to-red transitions of PDA vesicles. It has been already documented that the incorporation of the amphiphilic molecules into the PDA vesicles can stabilize either red [71] or blue forms [36] of the PDA-based backbones. The comparative monitoring of the pH-induced colorimetric changes of HCur-PDA and PDA vesicles through the CR% (Colorimetric Response calculated by the Equation (2) in the Supplementary Materials) indicate that both vesicles exhibit the blue-to-red transition at pHs above 8.0, while the transition of HCur-PDA becomes detectable at pH > 8.0 and while greater alkalization is required for the similar transition of PDA vesicles (Figures 4c and S4d). Heating is another well-known trigger of the blue-to-red transition [72]. Thus, the heating-induced changes of HCur-PDA vesicles should be compared with those of PDA itself. The data presented in Figure 4d indicate very poor transitions up to 55 \u25e6C, while the PDA vesicles themselves exhibit significant blue-to-red transition in these conditions. The fluorescence of HCur in the phospholipid vesicles exhibits insignificant changes in the Ih/Il values under heating (Figure 4e), while changes are detectable under the heating of HCur-PDA vesicles. The aforesaid changes can be correlated with the temperaturedependence of both conformational changes of HCur in the PDA-vesicles and hydrationinduced quenching. Thus, the greater distortions of HCur molecules under their incorporation into the PDA-vesicles vs. the PC(PS)-vesicles correlate with the higher sensitivity of HCur-PDA in comparison with HCur-PC(PS) to the temperature changes.

The values remain practically unchanged in the wide concentration range of Co2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, while the concentration-dependent decrease of Ih/Il values is observed in the solutions of Cd2+ and Pb2+ (Figure 5c). The aforesaid peculiarity derives from the increased planarity of the HCur molecule under the complex formation with Pb2+ and Cd2+. Moreover, the Ih/Il values plotted vs. various concentrations of metal ions reveals the selectivity of the HCur-PDA sensor to Cd2+ over Pb2+ ions (Figure 5c). It is worth noting that the selectivity derives from the conformational changes of HCur resulting from its complex formation with Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions with specific electronic structure (d10 and d10s2 correspondingly).

However, the close-to-linear increase in the CR values covers the concentration range 0\u20130.04 mM (Figure 6d), while the sharp decrease of the Ih/Il values within 0.002\u20130.025 mM of PL comes to the saturation level at 0.02\u20130.045 mM\nPolymers 2023, 15, 714 12 of 16\n(Figures 6e and S7d,e). The difference in the concentration ranges required for the chromatic and fluorescent responses of HCur-PDA reveals the difference between the binding of PL molecules with the fluorescent (HCur) and colorimetric (PDA) sensors. However, the Ih/Il values of HCur-PDA exhibit some decrease under the concentration of PL above 0.045 mM, which correlates with the blue-to-red phase transition of the PDA nanobead triggered by the interaction with PL. This provides one more argument for the interference between the colorimetric and fluorescent responses of HCur-PDA to PL. The results reveal an impact of the surface-exposed amino/ammonium groups of PL molecules on their efficient binding with HCur-PDA, which raises a question about a possibility of its fluorescent response to Lysozyme (LSZ) with the net charge at 8e and pI = 10.33 [78]. LSZ does not trigger the chromatic responses of both PDA and HCurPDA vesicles (Figure S6f). The fluorescent response of HCur-PDA requires a greater concentration of LSZ in comparison with that of PL. This correlates with the smaller amount of the surface-exposed amino/ammonium groups of LSZ, while the lack of any detectable fluorescent response of HCur-PDA to bovine serum albumin (BSA) correlates with its charge (\u221218e) and pI characteristics (4.7), which are quite different from those of LSZ."

            "text": "In summary, the newly synthesized representative of the hemicurcuminoid family bearing a nonyl substituent (HCur) forms the supramolecular assemblies with phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine and poly10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) molecules, which allows for the obtaining of mixed vesicular aggregates containing the fluorescent HCur through the thin film procedure. The HCur-PCDA vesicles were converted into the polymeric ones through photopolymerization. The phospholipid-based vesicles demonstrate the high loading by HCur molecules, while the loading extent is much less for the PDAbased vesicles. This correlates with molecular modeling simulations revealing the more favorable encapsulation of HCur molecules via their nonyl substituents into the phospholipidbased assemblies, while the PCDA-based assembly provides less efficient screening of HCur molecules from the exterior water molecules. The single-crystal XRD analysis revealed a high planarity of HCur molecules in the solid state, although the planarity distortion of HCur may have affected its spectral behavior in the mixed vesicles. The spectral behavior of HCur in the PDA-based aggregates differed from that in the phospholipid-based ones. In particular, the fluorescence of HCur in the PDA-based vesicles demonstrated much greater sensitivity to the external stimuli (temperature changing from 293 to 313 K and the pH increase from 7.5 to 9.5) than the fluorescence of HCur-PC(PS) vesicles. This highlights an impact of greater exposure of HCur to a bulk of solution on the sensitivity of its fluorescence to the external stimuli. It is also worth noting that HCur-PDA is introduced as the dual fluorescent-chromatic nanosensor. The difference in the sensitivity and selectivity of the fluorescent and chromatic responses of HCur-PDA indicates that they are driven by the substrate\u2013HCur and substrate\u2013PDA interactions correspondingly. Thus, the fluorescent response of HCur-PDA vesicles to both heavy metal ions (Pb2+ and Cd2+) and polylysine is more sensitive than the colorimetric response of the vesicles, although both responses interfere with each other. This highlights both the molecular structure of HCur and its supramolecular package into the different vesicular aggregates as the key factors responsible for the sensing ability towards the heavy metal ions and polylysine. However, further modifications on both molecular and supramolecular levels are required to develop a sensor able to recognize protein molecules.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 714 13 of 16\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/xxx/s1: Table S1. 1H and 13C chemical shiftsa (ppm) and spin-spin coupling constants (Hz) observed for the enol form of compounds HCur-BF2 and HCur in DMSO-d6 at 303K; Table S2.
