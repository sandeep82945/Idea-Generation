They claim that electric fields in E > B regions (for a vanishing guide field) dominate in accelerating particles to the injection energy \u03b3inj \u223c \u03c3 (magnetization). They suggest that the diffusion regions host particles for a sufficient time for efficient injection. S22 presented test-particle simulations showing that if particle energies are reset to low energies in E > B regions, efficient injection is suppressed. This issue has strong implications for modeling large-scale reconnection system, and thus important to resolve.\nThis Comment re-examines these claims by analyzing a simulation resembling the reference case in S22 using VPIC [8]. We find nearly no particle stayed in E > B regions long enough to achieve injection by the reconnecting electric field. The acceleration in E > B regions only contributes a small fraction to the injection energy (\u223c 10%\u03b3inj on average) [6]. The energization before any E > B crossings has a comparable contribution, indicating E > B regions are not unique in pre-accelerating particles. A new test-particle simulation shows that zeroouting electric fields in E > B regions does not strongly influence the injection. We suggest that the procedure used in S22 to exclude E > B acceleration partly removes acceleration outside E > B regions, leading to a false conclusion that injection by E > B regions is a necessary prerequisite.\nThe initial magnetic field B = B0 tanh(z/\u03bb)ex + B0 sech(z/\u03bb)ey. B0 is the reconnecting-field magnitude and \u03bb(= 6 skin depth de) is the half-layer-thickness. \u03c3 = 50 and temperature kT = 0.36mec 2. The box\nsize is Lx \u00d7 Lz = 1600de \u00d7 1200de and the simulation lasts 2.5Lx/c, with a small perturbation added to trigger reconnection. Each de is resolved by 4 cells with 100 positron-electron-pairs per cell. Boundary conditions are periodic in the x-direction and conducting (reflecting) in the z-direction for fields (particles). We trace 1.28 million particles uniformly and record the electromagnetic fields they experience at every time-step [9]. The reconnection dynamics and nonthermal energy spectra in the magnetically-dominated regime have been well documented [2\u20137, 10].\nDuring injection \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c3(\u03c3/4), 77.5%(51.0%) of the injected tracers have E > B crossings (\u201cE > B particles\u201d). S22 found a stronger correlation, since they label all particles that ever crossed E > B regions during the entire simulation, rather than just during injection [11]. Clearly, there is a significant fraction of particles injected without the need to cross the E > B regions [12]. Nevertheless, it is still interesting to explore if E > B regions are important for particles that crossed those regions before achieving injection.\nDuring injection, E > B particles can have multiple E > B crossings. Our analysis includes all the duration that particles are in E > B regions. The time tells the limit of acceleration in the regions \u2206\u03b3E>B <\u223c\u222b qrB0cdt/(mec\n2), where reconnection rate r \u223c 0.1. For \u03c3 = 50, \u03c9petinj >\u223c 50 is needed for \u03b3inj = \u03c3 (\u03c9petinj >\u223c 12.5 for \u03b3inj = \u03c3/4). Fig. 1a shows the time distribution of E > B particles stayed in E > B regions during injection. The mean time that particles stay in those regions is \u03c9pet\u0304 = 4.2(1.8) for \u03b3inj = \u03c3(\u03c3/4) and nearly no E > B particles have time to reach \u03b3inj. Fig. 1b shows the distribution of particle energy gain (during injection) in E > B regions (blue), before E > B crossings (red), and\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n03 43\n5v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .H\nE ]\n6 A\nug 2\n02 2\noutside E > B regions after the first E > B crossing (black). Consistently, the acceleration in E > B regions is too little for direct injections, with \u2206\u03b3\u0304E>B = 4.8(1.6) for \u03b3inj = \u03c3(\u03c3/4). Interestingly, we find comparable acceleration before particles encounter any E > B, giving \u2206\u03b3\u0304b,E>B = 5.6(2.5) for \u03b3inj = \u03c3(\u03c3/4). This suggests that E > B acceleration is not unique in pre-accelerating particles. Note that this result is consistent with Fig. 3 in S22, but unfortunately overlooked in their interpretation. Fig. 1b also shows that most acceleration during injection occurs outside E > B regions. We evolve a test-particle component in the simulation that does not \u201csee\u201d the electric field in E > B regions (so no acceleration during each crossing), and find 84% (94%) for \u03b3inj = \u03c3(\u03c3/4) compare to self-consistent particles are still injected. There is no significant difference between energy spectra of the test-particles and self-consistent particles (Fig. 1c). In contrast, when particle energies are reset to an energy of 10kT during E > B crossings (resembling S22), particle injection is suppressed. Obviously, this difference is because resetting particle energy removes the acceleration before and between E > B crossings.\nOur analysis demonstrated that the apparent correlation between particle injection and E > B crossings do not have direct physical relation. Most acceleration for E > B particles is not achieved by E > B regions. We have reached the same conclusion for different \u03c3 and domain sizes, which will be presented elsewhere.\nAcknowledgment.\u2014 We are thankful for discussions with Lorenzo Sironi, as well as discussions with Joel Dahlin, Jim Drake, Colby Haggerty, Dmitri Uzdensky, and Greg Werner.
