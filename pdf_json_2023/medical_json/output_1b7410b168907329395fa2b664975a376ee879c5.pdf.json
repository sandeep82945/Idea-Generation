    "abstractText": "In recent years, organic fluorescent probes with tumor microenvironment (TME)responsive fluorescence turn-on properties have been increasingly used in imagingguided tumor resection due to their higher signal-to-noise ratio for tumor imaging compared to non-responsive fluorescent probes. However, although researchers have developed many organic fluorescent nanoprobes responsive to pH, GSH, and other TME, few probes that respond to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the TME have been reported in imaging-guided surgery applications. In this work, we prepared Amplex \u00ae Red (ADHP) with excellent ROS response performance as an ROSresponsive nanoprobe and studied its application in image-guided tumor resection for the first time. To confirm whether the nanoprobe can be used as an effective biological indicator to distinguish tumor sites, we first detected 4T1 cells with the ADHP nanoprobe, demonstrating that the probe can utilize ROS in tumor cells for responsive real-time imaging. Furthermore, we conducted fluorescence imaging in vivo in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, and the ADHP probe can rapidly oxidize to form resorufin in response to ROS, which can effectively reduce the background fluorescence signal compared with the single resorufin probe. Finally, we successfully carried out image-guided surgery of 4T1 abdominal tumors under the guidance of fluorescence signals. This work provides a new idea for developing more TME-responsive fluorescent probes and exploring their application in image-guided surgery.",

However, although researchers have developed many organic fluorescent nanoprobes responsive to pH, GSH, and other TME, few probes that respond to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the TME have been reported in imaging-guided surgery applications. In this work, we prepared Amplex \u00ae Red (ADHP) with excellent ROS response performance as an ROSresponsive nanoprobe and studied its application in image-guided tumor resection for the first time. To confirm whether the nanoprobe can be used as an effective biological indicator to distinguish tumor sites, we first detected 4T1 cells with the ADHP nanoprobe, demonstrating that the probe can utilize ROS in tumor cells for responsive real-time imaging. Furthermore, we conducted fluorescence imaging in vivo in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, and the ADHP probe can rapidly oxidize to form resorufin in response to ROS, which can effectively reduce the background fluorescence signal compared with the single resorufin probe. Finally, we successfully carried out image-guided surgery of 4T1 abdominal tumors under the guidance of fluorescence signals. This work provides a new idea for developing more TME-responsive fluorescent probes and exploring their application in image-guided surgery.\nKEYWORDS\nnanoparticle, reactive oxygen species, image-guided, surgery, breast cancer\n1 Introduction\nBreast cancer is the prevalent malignancy in women worldwide, and in 2020 with an estimated 2.3 million new patients and 685,000 mortality cases (Sung et al., 2021), accounting for 30% of new female tumors in 2021 (Siegel et al., 2021). It is a serious threat to women\u2019s health and an important cause of female death. The preferred treatment for breast cancer is surgical excision combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Ma et al., 2020b). The surgical outcome and patient prognosis depend largely on the complete resection rate of the tumor. Postoperative tumor residue was associated with poor prognosis, high recurrence rate, and low survival rate. The higher the tumor resection rate is, the longer the overall survival of patients (Kimbrough et al., 2013; McCann et al., 2013; Tummala et al., 2013). At present, the extent of surgical resection still relies heavily on the surgeon\u2019s experience. However, the visual and tactile distinction between tumor and healthy tissue is not effective, making it difficult to determine the surgical margins and leaving tiny lesions that can lead to recurrence and"

Therefore, the key to the success of surgery is how to accurately locate and image tumors and their microscopic lesions intraoperatively and how to maximize the removal of tumors while protecting healthy tissues as much as possible. Recently, molecular imaging techniques has rapidly advancing in the field of bioimaging due to its advantages of great sensitivity, speedy and immediate imaging, biological safety, ease of detection and low cost, etc. Fluorescence imaging-guided surgery brings hope to solving the abovementioned challenges (Antaris et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2018).\nMolecular imaging techniques allows non-invasive real-time tumor diagnosis and imaging-guided surgery, assisting surgeons in detecting and resecting tiny tumors sensitively and accurately, significantly improving the therapeutic outcome of tumor surgery. Fluorescent probes could improve the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) by increasing the target signal or decreasing the background signal intensity to enhance the imaging sensitivity and specificity (Owens et al., 2016). Fluorescent probes can generally be divided into two categories: \u201cAlways ON\u201d probes and \u201cTurn ON\u201d probes (responsive probes) (Lou et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017; Jiao et al., 2018; Li and Pu, 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022). \u201cAlways ON\u201d probes emit fluorescence continuously under all conditions (whether they reach the target), which increases the background signal and reduces the SBR. In contrast, \u201cTurn ON\u201d probes change the fluorescence signal from \u201coff\u201d to \u201con\u201d in response to the target (e.g., pH, ROS, or bioenzyme), maximizing the target signal while minimizing the background signal, thus maximizing the SBR, improving the sensitivity and resolution of biosensing (Tang et al., 2019).\nAmong them, organic fluorescent probes with the tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive fluorescence-on properties have attracted our interest. The breast TME is a complex ecological environment. In addition to hypoxia, acidosis, elevated levels of lactic acid and adenosine (Cassim and Pouyssegur, 2020), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are much higher than those in normal tissues (Xu et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2020a; Malla et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Although many organic fluorescent nanoprobes, such as pondus hydrogenii (pH), glutathione (GSH), and other TME responses, have been developed by researchers and applied to imaging-guided surgery, fluorescence probes that respond to high levels of ROS in the TME have rarely been reported. We hypothesized that high levels of ROS in the TME could be used as a bioindicator to identify solid tumors and thus use\nROS-responsive fluorescent probes to accurately identify tumor tissue and perform image-guided surgery. In this work, the 10- acetyl-3, 7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex\u00ae Red, ADPH) with excellent ROS responsiveness was prepared as a ROS-responsive nanoprobe, and the performance of ROS-responsive fluorescence imaging was first assessed at the cellular level. Then, its fluorescence imaging sensitivity in complex biological environment in vivo was validated in mice models, and its application in image-guided tumor resection was investigated. The results show that the ROS-responsive fluorescent nanoprobe can perform effective fluorescence imaging of tumors and their microscopic lesions, providing a new theoretical basis for the application of responsive fluorescent probes in the surgical navigation of breast cancer."

ADPH, catalyzed by HRP, can react with ROS (mainly H2O2) to produce resorufin, which has red fluorescence (Zhou et al., 1997) (Figure 1).\nThe photophysical properties of ADPH and resorufin in DMSO were first investigated. Figure 2A showed the absorption spectra of ADPH in DMSO with a peak at 288 nm, then resorufin with an absorption peak at 467 nm and an emission peak at 570 nm (Supplementary Figure S1). Further the fluorescence intensity variation of ADPH in response to various concentrations of H2O2 was studied. The results showed that different concentrations of H2O2 (from 0 to 10 \u03bcM) reacted with 2 \u03bcM ADPH under 0.1 U/mL HRP catalysis, resulting in a concentration-dependent increase in the fluorescence emission intensity of the reaction product at 590 nm (Figure 2B). These results indicate that ADPH can effectively respond to ROS stimulation and turn on the fluorescence signal, which provides the possibility of a responsive tracer."

The DLS outcomes indicated that the average hydrodynamic diameters of the ADHP NPs and resorufin NPs were 110.7 nm and 141.43 nm, respectively (Figure 3A; Supplementary Figure S2A), which allowed the NPs to passively target tumor tissue with enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effects (Cheng et al., 2013). The morphology of the ADHP NPs was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), showing a homogeneous spherical structure with an average diameter of about 110 nm (Figure 3B). The slightly larger diameter measured by DLS relative to the TEM results may be due to the shrinkage of nanoparticles during TEM sample preparation.

Many studies have confirmed that ROS levels in the breast TME are higher than those in normal tissues (Malla et al., 2021). To validate the ROS response of ADHP NPs and the ability to image cells in vitro, the BSO, a glutamylcysteine synthase inhibitor, was used to increase intracellular H2O2 levels. Confocal fluorescence microscopy results showed that in the two groups without the addition of ADHP NPs, no fluorescence signal was detected in the group with or without BSO (Figures 5A, B). In the other two groups, after co-incubation with ADHP NPs for 4 h, one group added 50 mM BSO and incubated for another 3 h. As shown in Figure 5C, there was a weak fluorescence signal in the BSO (\u2212) group, indicating a low level of ROS in 4T1 cells cultured in vitro, while the fluorescence brightness in the BSO (+) group was significantly enhanced (Figure 5D).

ADHP NPs and resorufin NPs were intravenously injected into 4T1 subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice, respectively. The mice were sacrificed 24 h later, and the tumors and major organs were removed for fluorescence imaging at the same time (Figure 6A). Ex vivo fluorescence imaging showed that the liver, lung, and tumor in the resorufin NPs group displayed fluorescence, of which the liver had the strongest fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence ratio of the tumor to the liver was only 0.4 (Figure 6B), suggesting that the tumor-to-liver signal ratio of the \u201cAlways ON\u201d fluorescent probe was low. Due to the strong liver fluorescence signal background during in vivo imaging, it is difficult to distinguish the tumor fluorescence signal. In contrast, in the ADHP NPs group, although the liver, lung, and tumor showed fluorescence signals, the fluorescence ratio of the tumor to the liver was as high as 6.67 (Figure 6C). These results suggest that because of the higher ROS levels in tumor tissue than in normal tissue, ROS-responsive ADHP NPs can respond adequately to them and switch on the fluorescent signal.

Patients with distant metastases have a poor prognosis, the five-year survival rate was only 27% (DeSantis et al., 2019). In clinical surgical oncology, intraoperative imaging to precisely locate tumor nodes, detect and completely remove all tumor lesions can greatly improve the success rate of surgery and avoid tumor recurrence. After abdominal metastasis of breast cancer, many tiny tumor nodules are scattered in the peritoneal cavity, leading to further metastasis, and spread of the tumor, and the survival rate of patients is significantly reduced. Therefore, accurate preoperative evaluation and intraoperative real-time imaging are necessary. Thus, we established mice models of peritoneal metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer cells to assess the ability of ADHP NPs as an ROSresponsive nanoprobe to identify microscopic tumor nodules in vivo. To detect the tumor distribution, we selected luciferaseexpressing 4T1 breast cancer cell lines, which showed bioluminescence after injection of luciferin. After intravenously injecting ADHP NPs (200 \u03bcL, 30 \u03bcM based on ADHP) into a\nmouse for 24 h, the mouse\u2019s abdominal cavity was dissected for bioluminescence imaging and fluorescence imaging. As a result of the EPR effect of tumors (Cheng et al., 2013), ADPH NPs can be enriched in the tumor site and the fluorescence signal of ADHP NPs completely coincided with the bioluminescence signal of fluorescein in the peritoneal cavity. It is proved that ADHP NPs can turn on the fluorescence signal in response to the high concentration of ROS in TME and accurately locate the tumor lesions. (Figures 7A, B).\nClinically, surgeons mainly rely on the naked eye to distinguish which tissues need to be removed and retained. Although sizeable tumors (>1 mm) were excised by the surgeon (the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University) after naked eye resolution, there were still some tiny (submillimeter level) unidentifiable tumor nodules remaining. With the help of the fluorescence signal of the high SBR of AHDP NPs, the residual tiny metastases in the peritoneal cavity of the tumor-bearing mice were clearly visible. Therefore, a second surgical resection was performed under the guidance of fluorescence imaging signals, and the tumors were observed to be excised postoperatively (Figures 7C, D). The operation took approximately 15 min. The bioluminescence signals and fluorescence signals of all resected tumor nodules completely overlapped (Figures 8A, B).

Using resorufin NPs as the contrast agent, the tumor-to-liver signal ratio of ADHP NPs was first measured in vivo, demonstrating that ROS-responsive fluorescent probes can effectively reduce the background signal interference in fluorescence imaging. Subsequently, under the real-time fluorescence signals guidance of ADHP NPs, peritoneal metastases and their boundaries with normal tissues were clearly displayed, and the tiny tumor lesions were accurately located and resected. The ROSresponsive fluorescence probes can minimize the background signal in fluorescence imaging and provide accurate intraoperative visualization of submillimeter tumor lesions with higher sensitivity and resolution, ensuring complete tumor removal. The ROSresponsive fluorescence probe offers more possibilities for the future use of responsive fluorescence probes in surgical navigation."
