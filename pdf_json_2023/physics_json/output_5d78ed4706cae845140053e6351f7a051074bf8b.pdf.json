    "abstractText": "The ability to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons, including (i) benzene, toluene, o-xylene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, benzo[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene; (ii) polar substituted derivatives of benzene, including phenol and aniline; (iii) N-heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine; 2-, 3-, and 4-picolines; 2and 6-lutidine; 2and 4-hydroxypyridines; (iv) derivatives of aromatic acids, including coumarin, of 133 Rhodococcus strains from the Regional Specialized Collection of Alkanotrophic Microorganisms was demonstrated. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of these aromatic compounds for Rhodococcus varied in a wide range from 0.2 up to 50.0 mM. o-Xylene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the less-toxic and preferred aromatic growth substrates. Rhodococcus bacteria introduced into the PAH-contaminated model soil resulted in a 43% removal of PAHs at an initial concentration 1 g/kg within 213 days, which was three times higher than that in the control soil. As a result of the analysis of biodegradation genes, metabolic pathways for aromatic hydrocarbons, phenol, and nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds in Rhodococcus, proceeding through the formation of catechol as a key metabolite with its following ortho-cleavage or via the hydrogenation of aromatic rings, were verified.",

            "text": "Aromatic compounds, such as mixtures of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers (BTEX), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenol, aniline, phthalates, pyridine, quinoline, coumarin, and their derivatives, represent a large group of dangerous ecopollutants. These compounds are released into the environment as a result of oil spills; leaks and wastes from petrochemical and synthetic industries including the production of fuels, refinery products, explosives, resins, plasticizers, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, paints, pharmaceuticals, dyes, cosmetics, textile processing, and leather manufacturing; leaching from landfills; releases via tail gas from automobile exhausts; transport leaks; combustion; anthropogenic activities at gas stations, steel-making factories, and the coal chemical industry [1\u201312]. Aromatic pollutants exhibit carcinogenic, genotoxic, cytotoxic, phytotoxic, teratogenic, mutagenic, DNA-damaging, and enzyme-inhibiting effects; trigger cell aggregation; cause bone marrow diseases; induce reproductive disorders; act as solvents for cell components or as endocrine-disrupting agents, and vapors can cause eye, nose, and throat irritation as well as headaches, dizziness, and nausea [4,5,7\u20139,12,13]. The development of efficient and available methods for the complete degradation of these pollutants and remediation of biotopes contaminated with arenes is required [10]. Bioremediation, which exploits the metabolic properties of pollutant-degrading microorganisms for the elimination of toxic compounds in contaminated sites, is a well-known\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2393. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28052393 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2393 2 of 20\necologically safe and cost-efficient approach [14\u201317]. To metabolize aromatic pollutants, microorganisms use a complex of adaptations including mechanisms of resistance against chemical toxicants, systems for the cellular transport of pollutants, and specific catalytic enzymes. On the one hand, arenes are recalcitrant molecules as they have aromatic rings, which are chemically stable conjugated \u03c0\u2013electron systems. On the other hand, the metabolism of all arenes is unified, resulting in the formation of universal metabolites such as catechol, protocatechuate, gentisate, homogentisate, or benzaldehyde with further ortho- or meta-cleavage of aromatic rings [17\u201320]. Non-specific enzymes determine the ability of bacteria to simultaneously degrade various aromatic compounds, for example, PAHs and BTEX, or PAH mixtures [19,21,22]. At the same time, the specific enzymes are responsible for the initial transformation of aromatic molecules. Various microorganisms can degrade aromatic compounds. Among them are bacteria (members of Acinetobacter, Achromobacter, Aeromonas, Agromyces, Alcaligenes, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Burkholderia, Comamonas, Delftia, Halomonas, Lactobacillus, Nocardiodes, Ochrobactrum, Pseudomonas, Pseudonocardia, Rhodococcus, etc.) and fungi (members of Aspergillus, Cunninghamella, Glomerella, Saccharomyces, etc.). The biodegradation abilities of microbial communities and pure cultures toward toxic arenes are described [1,3,6,11,12,20,23\u201326]. A promising group of aromatic biodegraders is the extremotolerant bacteria of the genus Rhodococcus Zopf 1891 (Approved Lists 1980; domain \u2019Bacteria\u2019, phylum Actinomycetota, class Actinomycetes, order Mycobacteriales, family Nocardiaceae; https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/ rhodococcus, accessed on 2 March 2023). Rhodococcus spp. are isolated from many polluted areas; dominate in hydrocarbon-contaminated ecosystems; are able to metabolize a wide range of emerging pollutants including petroleum hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, pharma pollutants, pesticides, explosives, flame retardants, plasticizers, defoliants, dyes, and microplastics; are resistant to multiple stresses; are able to maintain high metabolic activities under adverse conditions [15,16,27\u201330]. Rhodococcus bacteria can degrade BTEX, PAHs, phenol, phthalates, phthalic esters, pyridine, quinoline, and complex aromatic compounds [6,24,29\u201335]. Most studies describe individual Rhodococcus strains isolated from environmental samples or, more rarely, their associations. However, a comparative investigation of the ability of various Rhodococcus species to degrade diverse aromatic compounds has not yet been performed. In ecobiotechnology, the biological and ecological safeties of bacterial cultures are important parameters. The use of strains not identified at the species level (Rhodococcus sp.) for bioremediation causes risks of pathogenic or phytopathogenic strains entering the environment. To minimize these risks, it is recommended to order strains from well-known microbial collections [15]. Microbial culture collections registered with the World Data Centre for Microorganisms (WDCM, http://wdcm.nig.ac.jp, accessed on 2 March 2023) are powerful sources of properly characterized and biotechnologically promising strains with high metabolic activities. Cultures deposited there are well described in terms of taxonomy and pathogenic/phytopathogenic properties with relevant information on strain features (isolation and growth conditions, utilized substrates, adhesive activities, tolerance, etc.) [36]. One such collection is the Regional Specialized Collection of Alkanotrophic Microorganisms (acronym IEGM, www.iegmcol.ru, accessed on 2 March 2023, WFCC 285), where the largest fund of pure, identified, and well-described hydrocarbon-oxidizing isolates belonging to the genus Rhodococcus is maintained [37]. The aim of this study was to estimate the metabolic capabilities of Rhodococcus strains from the IEGM Collection to degrade a variety of aromatic compounds."

Two groups of aromatic substances were clearly distinguished: relatively low toxicity (MIC = 25.0\u201350.0 mM) and high toxicity (MIC = 0.2\u20130.8 mM). Most of the tested compounds (o-xylene, all PAHs, o-phthalic acid, salicylic acid, phenol, aniline, pyridine, methyl- and hydroxy-substituted derivatives of pyridine, and coumarin) constituted the first group. The second group contained benzene, toluene, and meta- and para-isomers of phthalic acid. The toxicities of aromatic compounds from the second group were 31\u2013250 times higher than those from the first group. Moderate toxicity (MIC = 6.3 mM) was revealed for only one compound, a two-ring N-heterocycle quinoline (Table 1)."

The growth of Rhodococcus cells in the presence of benzene and o-xylene was related to the toxicity of these compounds. Benzene was the more toxic and less preferred substrate, and Rhodococcus cells grew weaker in its presence compared to o-xylene. The percentage of strains able to utilize benzene varied from 8% to 35% and was highest among strains of R. ruber (Figure 1). Between 2 and 11 times more strains were able to grow in the presence of o-xylene. Only R. opacus did not use o-xylene as a growth substrate, as no R. opacus strains grew in the presence of this arene (Figure 1 and Table S2). The analysis of the abilities of all tested strains to utilize monoaromatic hydrocarbons confirmed that o-xylene was a more preferable substrate for Rhodococcus than benzene. The 66 Rhodococcus strains from the 117 total strains analyzed grew in the presence of o-xylene, which corresponded to 56% o-xylene-degrading strains. Only 25 strains from a total of 102 grew in the presence of benzene, which corresponded to 25% benzene-degrading strains (Figure 2a).

They incorporate two oxygen atoms into the central metabolites (catechol, protocatechuate, gentisate, homogentisate, etc.), thus resulting i ring cleavage [18]. In the genomes of the studied Rhodococcus strains, dioxygenases for ortho (intradiol) and meta (extradiol) ring cleavage were found. They included catechol 1,2- and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenases for intradiol oxidation, and catechol 2,3-, gentisate 1,2-, homogentisate 1,2-, and other extradiol dioxygenases for extradiol oxidation. The preferred pathway for catechol cleavage was, apparently, ortho-oxidation as catechol 1,2-dioxygenases were revealed in all studied genomes. Catechol 2,3-dioxygenases were found only in R. opacus IEGM 249, R. pyridinivorans IEGM 1137, and R. ruber IEGM 231 genomes (Table 3 and Table S3). Other enzymes that could lead to the multistep formation of key metabolites from complex aromatic compounds with several rings and vari us functional groups [18] included phenol monooxygenases, 4-hydroxybenzoate 3-, 3-hydroxybenzoate 6-, and salicylate 1-hydroxylases, and vanillate 3-O demethylases (Table 3).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2393 9 of 20\nAmong specific genes coded for the enzymes oxidizing benzene and its homologs, one gene annotated as a benzene 1,2-dioxygenase was found in the genome of R. ruber IEGM 231.

Another enzyme for dearomatization was phenylacetyl-CoA oxygenase/reductase found in sequenced R. erythropolis/R. qingshengii strains. Phenol monooxygenases [3] found in R. ruber IEGM 231 and phenol hydrolases found in R. opacus IEGM 249 and R. pyridinivorans IEGM 1137 could participate in the degradation of phenol. Among enzymes probably participating in the biodegradation of aromatic compounds with nitrogen atoms (aniline, pyridine, and its derivatives), genes coded for anthranilate 1,2- and 3-hydroxy anthranilate 3,4-dioxygenases, maleamate isomerases, amidases including formamidases, maleamate amidohydrolases, aldehyde dehydrogenases, and succinatesemialdehyde dehydrogenases [9,18,20,23] but not aniline, 2-aminophenol 1,6-, indole 3-acetate dioxygenases, 6-hydroxynicotinate 3-monooxygenases and 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA monooxygenases/reductases [18,40] were revealed (Table 3 and Table S3). This spectrum of putative enzymes suggests the biodegradation of pyridine via hydrogenation followed by cleavage of the C2-C3 double bond [9]. Among the genes of coumarin biodegradation, those coded for fumarylacetoacetate and hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolases, flavinbinding hydroxylases, and extradiol dioxygenases but not 3-(3-hydroxy-phenyl)propionate hydroxylases [25] were detected in Rhodococcus genomes. No gene evidently responsible for the biodegradation of phthalates, such as phthalate, terephthalate and isophthalate dioxygenases, 3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrophthalate and 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxyphthalate dehydrogenases, and 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate and 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylases [41], were revealed in the sequenced genomes.

            "text": "Based on the metabolic abilities of 133 Rhodococcus strains from the Regional Specialized Collection of Alkanotrophic Microorganisms, common regularities of aromatic compound biodegradation by Rhodococcus bacteria were revealed and discussed in terms of the toxicity and putative functional genes. According to the preference for Rhodococcus cells, the studied aromatic substrates can be arranged (from more to less preferrable) as PAHs (61% of strains used naphthalene, and all tested naphthalene-degrading strains grew in the presence of PAHs with between three and five aromatic rings) > o-xylene (56% of strains used) > toluene (39% of strains used) > benzene (25% of strains used) > pyridine (22% of strains used) > phenol (16% of strains used). This preference row reflected the toxicity of aromatic hydrocarbons (Table 1), which increased from PAHs to benzene. Interestingly, all PAHs used, regardless of the number of aromatic rings, molecular weight, and even water solubility [33], were equally preferred for Rhodococcus cells (Figure 4). A similar effect was found earlier for Rhodococcus, and it depended on the strain specificities and cell adhesive activities toward PAH crystals [34]. However, the polar-substituted derivatives of benzene, pyridine, and phenol did not fully correspond to the revealed dependence. These less-toxic compounds were degraded more poorly compared to highly toxic benzene and toluene, which could be explained by the specific enzymatic mechanisms of their degradation. It was expected that this study would reveal a certain species specificity of the metabolic profiles (spectra of oxidized aromatic compounds) of the studied Rhodococcus strains. However, no strict correlation between species and the ability of Rhodococcus strains to metabolize specific aromatic substrates was detected. Strains able to grow in the presence of benzene, toluene, o-xylene, naphthalene, pyridine, or phenol and not using these compounds were found among different Rhodococcus species. Similarly, strains of R. erythropolis/R. qingshegii, R. opacus, R. rhodochrous, and R. ruber species grew in the presence of PAHs (Figure 4). Nevertheless, some species specificities were revealed: (i) R. opacus did not use o-xylene, and (ii) R. ruber somewhat better-metabolized aromatic compounds, especially in comparison with the most represented R. erythropolis/R. qingshegii. The latter was confirmed by the highest percentage of R. ruber strains growing in the presence of benzene and the 1.5 and 4.0 higher percentage of strains oxidizing phenol and toluene in\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2393 11 of 20\ncomparison with R. erythropolis/R. qingshengii. Moreover, the ability of R. ruber to oxidize pyridine (pyridine-degrading strains were not found among R. erythropolis/R. qingshegii strains) and the ability of the reference strain R. ruber IEGM 231 to oxidize most of the tested aromatic pollutants indicate a high biodegradation potential of this Rhodococcus species. The metabolic potential of R. rhodochrous was close to that of R. ruber as all tested R. rhodochrous strains grew in the presence of PAHs and phenol, and R. rhodochrous IEGM 757 was able to use pyridine. Possible explanations for the inability of R. opacus to use o-xylene, a relatively less toxic compound, are the absence of specific oxidizing enzymes, the low affinity of benzene/toluene-degrading enzymes to o-xylene, or the lack of specific transporting systems. In fact, R. opacus poorly metabolized monoaromatic hydrocarbons. Even considering benzene and toluene, only three strains of this species grew in the presence of these compounds (Table S2). Genes annotated for benzene/toluene monooxygenases or dioxygenases were not found in the genome of R. opacus IEGM 249 (Table S3), which did not utilize monoaromatic hydrocarbons (Table S2). It should be noted, however, that benzene/toluene mono- and dioxygenases were not detected in the most studied Rhodococcus genomes (Table S3). Nevertheless, R. opacus was recognized as a promising degrader of toxic organic pollutants as the highest numbers of oxidoreductases were revealed in the genome of R. opacus IEGM 249 (Table 3). No dependence was found between the abilities of Rhodococcus strains to oxidize aromatic compounds, the spectra of oxidized aromatic substances, and the source of strain isolation. The following strains were selected as the most promising degraders: R. aetherivorans IEGM 1250 and R. erythropolis IEGM 1232 (used all three monoaromatic hydrocarbons\u2014benzene, toluene, and o-xylene); R. ruber IEGM 1121 and IEGM 1156 (used benzene, toluene, o-xylene, PAHs, and weakly grew in the presence of phenol); R. erythropolis IEGM 190, IEGM 201, and IEGM 265 (used phenol); R. rhodochrous IEGM 1161 (used phenol and also naphthalene); R. erythropolis IEGM 788 and R. rhodochrous IEGM 1162 (used xylene, naphthalene, and phenol); R. ruber IEGM 1122 (used benzene, toluene, o-xylene, naphthalene, and phenol); R. rhodochrous IEGM 757 (used pyridine); R. ruber IEGM 231 (a well-characterized strain with high metabolic potential, able to use benzene, toluene, PAHs, pyridine and its derivatives, aniline, and coumarin). The R. fascians strain IEGM 1233 degraded all the studied monoaromatic hydrocarbons; however, as it represented a phytopathogenic species [42], we did not consider it to be an appropriate biotechnology agent. It was hypothesized that microorganisms from anthropogenically disturbed and contaminated ecosystems had developed diverse metabolic capacities and multiple resistance to stress factors [27,28]. Among the selected 14 most active biodegraders, 7 strains were isolated from pristine environments, and the other 7 were isolated from disturbed sites, either polluted or located near pollution sources (Table S1). In fact, the impact of the isolation source on the biodegradation abilities of Rhodococcus was difficult to identify. For example, when strains were isolated within the city, analysis suggested some level of chemical contamination, even if no pollutants were defined and the sites were assumed to be pristine. Special attention in this study was paid to the analysis of putative biodegradation genes. For this, 10 sequenced genomes of Rhodococcus strains from the IEGM Collection were annotated and searched for relevant functional genes. The obtained results proposed enzymatic mechanisms of aromatic compound biodegradation and predicted metabolic activities of particular Rhodococcus species. Catechol dioxygenases, key enzymes of arene biodegradation pathways, were found in all of the studied genomes of IEGM strains. This confirmed the metabolic ability of Rhodococcus to degrade molecules with aromatic structures as well as the preferred pathway for further catechol degradation through ortho-cleavage (Table 3). Considering the genes of the initial steps of aromatic biodegradation, they could be assumed as follows. One benzene 1,2-dioxygenase and three phenol monooxygenases were revealed in the R. ruber IEGM 231 genome, and phenol hydrolases (one gene in each strain) were revealed in the genomes of R. opacus IEGM 249\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2393 12 of 20\nand R. pyridinivorans IEGM 1137 (Table 3). These enzymes can provide primary oxidation of BTEX substrates (benzene, toluene, and o-xylene) and phenol, respectively. The highest number of specific enzymes in Rhodococcus genomes was revealed for the degradation of pyridine, its derivatives, and coumarin. The ability of R. ruber IEGM 231 to grow in the presence of 2- and 4-hydroxypyridines verified that rhodococci metabolized pyridine completely as these compounds were described as frequent end products in pyridine biodegradation [24]. In four Rhodococcus genomes, a gene coded for salicylate 1-hydroxylase, presumably responsible for salicylic acid assimilation, was revealed. This gene was not found in the R. ruber IEGM 231 genome (Table 3), which is a possible reason for the inability of this strain to metabolize salicylate (Figure 5). Interestingly, salicylate 5-hydroxylases were not found in the sequenced genomes (Table S3). Salicylic acid, along with phthalic acids, is known as an intermediate in PAH biodegradation [43,44]. The revealed genes indicated that the utilization of PAHs by Rhodococcus cells is performed, apparently, via catechol, but not the gentisate pathway [18]. It was surprising that no genes recognized as naphthalene or other PAH dioxygenases were detected in Rhodococcus genomes. Naphthalene dioxygenases were previously described for Rhodococcus spp. in relation to their structural, functional, and thermostability features [43,45\u201347]. The explanation could be that dioxygenases belong to a diverse class of Rieske non-heme iron oxygenases with a broad substrate specificity. They include, among others, phthalate, biphenyl, benzoate, toluene dioxygenases, and some monooxygenases [45,48]. Genes encoding dioxygenases can be annotated as extradiol dioxygenases, unspecific dioxygenases, or unspecific oxidases/oxidoreductases. The low (29\u201333%) similarity of naphthalene dioxygenase and, in contrast, high (77\u201381%) similarity of nitrobenzene dioxygenase subunits NarAa and NarAb from Rhodococcus sp. strain NCIMB12038 with the corresponding subunits from Pseudomonas [45] demonstrated a high diversity of naphthalene enzymes and possible misleading annotations. More detailed analysis of dioxygenase genes using multiple alignments and experimental confirmation of gene functions are required. Moreover, naphthalene-degrading operons can be located on plasmids, the absence of which may explain the inability of some Rhodococcus strains to grow in the presence of this compound. The variety of oxidizing enzymes with a broad substrate specificity found in Rhodococcus genomes determines the versatile and widely varying catabolic abilities of the studied strains. Hydrolases seemed to be no less important enzymes for the biodegradation of aromatic compounds by Rhodococcus bacteria than dioxygenases. Numerous genes coded for hydrolases (from 96 up to 229) were found in all studied Rhodococcus genomes (Table 3). They can participate in the degradation of PAH molecules [30]. Among hydrolases, formamidases and other amidases were detected. These enzymes, along with maleamate amidohydrolase found in the genome of R. ruber IEGM 231 (Table S3), can participate in the biodegradation of pyridine and its derivatives [9,18]. In addition to dioxygenases and hydrolases, putative aromatic biodegradation enzymes also included monooxygenases, especially cytochrome P450 oxidases, and multicopper polyphenol oxidases, or laccases. The latter can cause the oxidation of PAHs, phenolics, and other toxic pollutants [49,50], thereby allowing the growth of Rhodococcus in the presence of polyaromatics and phenol, even if specific enzymes are not annotated. Multicopper polyphenol oxidases were found in all the studied genomes of Rhodococcus spp., mainly in one copy, while four genes were detected in R. ruber IEGM 231 (Table 3). Some contradictory data were obtained for the biodegradation of phthalic acids aniline and quinoline. The reference strain R. ruber IEGM 231 did not grow in the presence of phthalic acid isomers, which was in agreement with the genome annotation: no genes coded for phthalic acid biodegradation enzymes were found in the genome of this strain or in the genomes of other Rhodococcus strains. Only one phthalate 3,4-dioxygenase gene was recognized in the genome of R. opacus IEGM 249 (Table S3). However, it is known that Rhodococcus bacteria can degrade phthalates and their esters, and phthalate 3,4-dioxygenases coded by the pht genes participate in these metabolic processes [31,32,41]. Phthalate operons are\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2393 13 of 20\nlocated on plasmids [32,41], and the lack of plasmids can explain the inability of the IEGM 231 strain to metabolize phthalic acids. Another substrate, which was not used by R. ruber IEGM 231, was quinoline. In the genome of this strain, as well as in other Rhodococcus genomes, genes coding for nitrite and nitrate reductases were revealed (Table S3). These enzymes could perform the degradation of quinoline via the 8-hydroxycoumarin pathway [20,23]. The inability of IEGM 231 to use quinoline can be due to the lack of other key enzymes or transporting proteins, but apparently not to quinoline toxicity, which was lower than benzene and toluene were. In contrast, R. ruber IEGM 231 grew in the presence of aniline, but no specific genes coded for the enzymes of the first steps of aniline biodegradation, such as aniline, 2-aminophenol 1,6-, indole 3-acetate dioxygenases, 6-hydroxynicotinate 3-monooxygenases, and 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA monooxygenases/reductases, were found in the genome of this strain. Enzymes with a broad substrate specificity (dioxygenases, for example) or enzymes of putative pyridine oxidation pathways (anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase, amidases, or maleamate amidohydrolase) can participate in the degradation of aniline by R. ruber IEGM 231. The metabolic properties of Rhodococcus strains from the IEGM Collection toward aromatic compounds were tested against heavy (1 g/kg) PAH contamination in a model soil. The obtained results showed the suitability of introducing Rhodococcus to remove aromatic hydrocarbons from soil. The percentage of removed hydrocarbons was three times higher in soil with introduced Rhodococcus bacteria compared to control soil and constituted 43% PAH removal over 213 days (Figure 6). To improve biodegradation, Rhodococcus cells were immobilized onto a sawdust-based carrier [51]. Immobilized cells maintained high PAH-oxidizing activity throughout the experiment. This was seen from the constant linear decline in PAH concentration, even after the total number of hydrocarbon-oxidizing microorganisms was decreased. The growth of PAH degraders within the first 35 days was seemingly related to easily biodegradable aromatic components, such as light PAHs or PAHs not sorbed on solid particles (Figure 6). After the depletion of these components, the abundance of hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria decreased, and the process of PAH biodegradation stopped in the control but continued in soil with introduced Rhodococcus cells. To further demonstrate the metabolic capabilities of Rhodococcus bacteria toward aromatic substances, their high oxidizing activities toward complex aromatic compounds, such as (RS)-2-(4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl)propanoic and [2-(2,6-dichloroanilino)phenyl]acetic acids, should be mentioned (Table 4). These complex aromatic acids were acting substances in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and Rhodococcus strains from the IEGM Collection degraded 100% of these compounds at high concentrations within 6 days (Table 4)."

They are part of a larger study of the biological and functional properties of this group of bacteria performed using the bioresources of the Regional Specialized Collection of Alkanotrophic Microorganisms. Rhodococcus strains deposited in the collection were isolated from various pristine and anthropogenically disturbed ecosystems, identified and well characterized. Moreover, the collection is constantly updated with freshly isolated\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2393 17 of 20\ncultures. In this work, the metabolic properties of the 133 collection strains belonging to various species of the genus Rhodococcus were determined. We assume that the obtained results were representative of the whole genus. No strict correlations were revealed between the abilities of Rhodococcus isolates to oxidize aromatic compounds, spectra of oxidized aromatic substances, and species. However, R. rhodochrous and R. ruber somewhat better oxidized various aromatic compounds, and R. opacus poorly metabolized monoaromatic hydrocarbons and did not use o-xylene. No dependence was revealed between the metabolic abilities of the studied strains toward aromatic compounds and the source of strain isolation. The toxicity of aromatic substances was not the only factor determining their bio-oxidation. The diversity of genes coded for degrading enzymes with a broad substrate specificity (mono- and dioxygenases, laccases, and hydrolases) was considered to be the basis for the versatile and widely varying catabolic abilities of Rhodococcus bacteria. At the same time, the analysis of functional annotations of 10 Rhodococcus genomes revealed that there is still no sufficient information on the enzyme mechanisms of aromatic compound degradation by Rhodococcus. Individual Rhodococcus strains may have no specific genes and be unable to metabolize some aromatics, even if these activities have previously been shown for other members of the genus. In this study, metabolic pathways for monoand polyaromatic hydrocarbons, phenol, and nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds in Rhodococcus, proceeding through the formation of catechol as a key metabolite with its following ortho-cleavage or via the hydrogenation of aromatic rings, were verified. However, further experimental verification of particular gene functions is required. Information on the IEGM Collection Rhodococcus strains can be used on an operational basis to construct biopreparations for emergency spills of ecopollutants, including aromatic pollutants, alone or simultaneously presented in the biotope with other xenobiotics. The developed biopreparations can be used in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with aromatics and requested by companies working in the area of ecobiotechnology. In this work, some promising biodegraders were selected, which metabolized a high diversity of aromatic pollutants and degraded the most recalcitrant substances. In model experiments, the high efficiency of the introduction of immobilized Rhodococcus cells for the remediation of contaminated soil was shown, which led to the 43% removal of PAHs for 213 days at an initial PAH concentration of 1 g/kg.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28052393/s1, Table S1: Rhodococcus strains (http:// www.iegmcol.ru, accessed on 2 March 2023); Table S2: Growth of Rhodococcus strains in the presence of aromatic compounds; Table S3: Numbers of genes coded for putative enzymes of aromatic compound biodegradation by Rhodococcus spp. (a large set of genes is presented).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, I.I. and A.K.; methodology, A.K., M.K. and I.I.; software, A.K.; validation, M.K. and T.P.; formal analysis, A.K., M.K. and T.P.; investigation, A.K. and T.P.; resources, I.I. and M.K.; data curation, M.K., C.J.C. and I.I.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.K.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.K., I.I. and C.J.C.; visualization, A.K.; supervision, I.I. and C.J.C.; project administration, I.I. and C.J.C.; funding acquisition, I.I. and M.K.
