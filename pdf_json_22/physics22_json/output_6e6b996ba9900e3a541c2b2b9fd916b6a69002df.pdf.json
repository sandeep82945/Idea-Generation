    "abstractText": "Phase transitions with spontaneous symmetry breaking are expected for group field theories as a basic feature of the geometogenesis scenario. The following paper aims to investigate the equilibrium phase for group field theory by using the ergodic hypothesis on which the Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions must break down. The breaking of the ergodicity can be considered dynamically, by introducing a fictitious \u201ctime\u201d inducing a stochastic process described through a Langevin equation, from which the randomness of the tensor field will be a consequence. This type of equation is considered particularly for complex just-renormalizable Abelian model of rank d = 5, and we study some of their properties by using a renormalization group considering a \u201ccoarsegraining\u201d both in time and space. \u2217vincent.lahoche@cea.fr \u2020dine.ousmanesamary@cipma.uac.bj 1 ar X iv :2 20 9. 02 32 1v 4 [ m at hph ] 2 D ec 2 02 3",

            "text": "For more than one decade, group field theories (GFTs) are considered as a promising way to address the quantum gravity conundrum. Mathematically, GFTs are fields theories defined on d-copies of a group manifold G, called group structure, and distinguish themselves from standard quantum field theories (QFTs) by the specific non-locality of their interactions [1\u20135]. In the point of view of quantization, the particles (quanta) associated to group fields are interpreted as elementary excitation of the gravitational field, which, instead of being characterized by concepts like energy, polarization and so on, are characterized by topological and geometrical data. The quantized space-time is of dimension d, and the elementary excitation is interpreted as (d \u2212 1)-simplices with labeled faces. The interactions between these fields dictate the way the faces are \u201cstuck\u201d to each other according to these labels, to give effective d \u2013 simplices. Thus, the non-local structure of the interaction tells us how dual (d \u2212 1)-simplices are built and glued together. The structure group on the other hand has to reflect the local symmetry group of the dual spacetime. This interpretation can be motivated by the relation between GFTs and covariant approaches of loop quantum gravity (LQG) like spin-foams [6]. Indeed, GFTs have been historically introduced in the context of the LQG [7\u201310] as a clever way to resume SF quantum amplitudes. Hence, on one hand, GFTs can be approached from the quantification of the classical general relativity (GR), which naturally leads to quantum states encoding discrete geometry as triangulation. It must be noticed that alternatively, GFT can be viewed as a second quantized version of LQG [11, 12]. Finally, the choice of the group structure is imposed by this connection with LQG, as the local group of space-time symmetries (SO(3, 1) with the Lorentz signature, SO(4) for Euclidean quantum gravity, but other groups can be considered as toy models like SU(2) for Euclidean 3D gravity, U(1) or R).\nOn the other hand, GFT can be approached directly through the prism of discrete random geometry, the continuum limit for quantum space-time being recovered as a phase transition in the model. For 2D, the most popular approach in this direction is random matrix models (RMM). In RMM, Feynman amplitudes provide weights for discrete triangulation, the way the elementary \u201ctriangles\u201d are glued together being imposed by the interactions between matrix fields. The main feature of RMM is the existence of a topological 1/N expansion, controlled by the genus g(\u2206) of the dual triangulation \u2206, and thus dominated by planar diagrams with g = 0. Critical properties and continuum limits of RMM are essentially consequences of this basic property [13\u201315]. Random tensors models (RTM) [16\u201318] are an attempt to extend the success of RMM to dimension higher than 2. The decisive step in this direction was the discovery by Gurau in 2009 of the existence of a power counting for colored random tensors, which admits an 1/N expansion analogous to RMM, controlled by a generalization (but unfortunately no topological) of the genus and called Gurau degree \u03d6. It has been shown that the existence of such a power count is related to an internal structure group, typically U(N) (or O(N), see [19\u201322]), leaving the interactions invariant [18, 23]. The leading order diagrams, having vanishing Gurau\ndegree, are called melons, and critical properties of melonic sector, as well as double scaling limits, have been investigated for RTMs [24\u201326]. With this respect, GFTs can be viewed as generalized RTM, with group-valued rather than discrete indices. This leads to a restrictive class of RTM, called Tensorial Group Field Theories (TGFTs), which are GFT whose interactions have the same non-local structure as RTMs, said tensorial interactions. Note that some additional symmetries like closure (Gauss) constraint or Plebanski constraint have to be considered in the first point of view [27\u201330]. The closure constraint for instance is a specific kind of gauge symmetry, which requires that physical fields solutions are invariant under the global right translation of the group elements [31, 32]. Imposing it at the quantum level, a Feynman amplitude looks like a partition function for a gauge theory on a random lattice fixed by the cellular complex defined by the Feynman graph, with flat discrete connections.\nThe main challenging issue for GFTs remains how a smooth space-time structure corresponding to classical GR can be recovered by summing a very large number of quantum states having a very large number of quanta [33\u201336], and to this aim, the renormalization group (RG) is generally considered as the powerful tool to address this issue. RG is a general concept in physics to tackle the large-scale description of systems involving a very large number of (microscopic) interacting degrees of freedom [37, 38]. There are many incarnations of this idea in physics and all of them aim to extract the large-scale regularities of a system, replacing its full description with an approximate but effective theory, keeping only relevant features of the original quantum (or statistical) microscopic states. In the Wilsonian point of view, RG is constructed from a partial integration procedure, integrating out \u201crapid\" modes to construct an effective physics for \u201cslow\" modes, keeping fixed the large distance physics. Two different strategies have been considered for constructing RG flow for GFTs. The first one is based on lattice renormalization, viewing spin foams as a direct space regularization of quantum gravity amplitudes [39]. The other approach is based on local field theories and renormalization techniques. Indeed, the existence of a power counting for TGFTs provides a novel notion of a locality called traciality, reflecting the way the divergences can be factorized out of some tensorial interaction. Renormalization \u201c\u00e0 la Wilson\u201d requires identifying \u201cslow\u201d (infrared) and \u201crapid\u201d (ultraviolet) modes. For TGFTs defined as enriched RTM with group valued indices, no such distinction exist between UV and IR modes. Indeed, usual GFT models or RTMs suggest that theories have to be ultra-local, with propagator equals to the identity matrix or suitable projectors, ensuring the global U(N) (or O(N)) invariance of RTMs. The triviality of the propagator is surely appropriate for simplicial quantum gravity perspectives, but does not allow for the definition of a proper notion of scale. However, this poses a difficulty, because, without such a suitable notion of scale, no distinction exists between fluctuating degrees of freedom. There are no \u201cinfrared\u201d (IR) or \u201cultraviolet\u201d (UV) degrees of freedom, and any partial integration procedure \u201c\u00e0 la Wilson\u201d imposes to arbitrarily fix what are IR and UV. This point of view has been considered in a series of papers both using perturbative and nonperturbative RG technics [40\u201345], but to date, there is no\nconsensus about the reliability of the resulting RG flow \u2013 see [46, 47]. A solution considered in the literature consists in modifying the propagator by adding a \u201cLaplacian\u201d type term (defined on the considered structure group) to the Gaussian kernel, whose non-trivial spectrum then provides a non-ambiguous notion of scale [48]. This Laplace type propagators may be viewed as a regulation, that affects only UV degrees of freedom but disappears in the IR, leading to an effective, dynamically generated ultralocal theory for the RG flow. Moreover, the presence of such a Laplacian can be motivated by the computation of radiative corrections to GFTs, which require such a Laplacian as a counter-term to be well-defined as the cut-off in large momenta is removed [49]. There is vast literature and active research on this topic, exploring both the perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of the TGFTs [48, 50\u201361]. These investigations generally seek to reveal fixed point solutions and phase transitions. Such solutions have been found for some models, although very dependent on the approximation scheme used to solve the flow equations in the nonperturbative regime. At first, it seemed that the existence of such fixed point solutions and second-order phase transitions was a quasi-universal feature for TGFTs [55, 56]. However, our recent works based on methods outperforming standard vertex expansion showed that it is not the case [62\u201365]. These methods consider both Ward identities and an effective vertex expansion (EVE) technique, which takes into account the full momenta dependence of the effective vertex and formally resumes branched sectors as the melonic one [46, 62\u201367]. The existence of second-order phase transitions in the phase space of TGFTs is expected to be a basic requirement for geometrogenesis-type scenarios, where the semi-classical spacetime is assumed to emerge as an \u201cinter-theoretical process\u201d from a Bose-Einstein condensation. It is worth mentioning that the hypothesis of the existence of such condensates has allowed the rapid development of a whole literature exploring models of quantum cosmology [27, 68\u201380].\nIn this paper, we address the problem of quantization of GFTs through a firstorder stochastic Langevin-type equation, such that equilibrium configurations match with standard path integral quantization for pure gravity models. The introduction of this equation can be considered a purely mathematical exercise, but can also have real physical meaning. It can be seen as a way to dynamically (i.e., out of equilibrium) address the phase transitions revealed by the RG for equilibrium theory. Indeed, in general, although the phase transitions are discussed in equilibrium, assuming the existence of an observer outside the system and adjusting adiabatically the parameters of the theory, a realistic description of the transition requires a non-equilibrium approach to this phenomenon. However, such a non-equilibrium treatment is generally a difficult task [34, 81]. In the quantum gravity context, an additional question that one is entitled to ask concerns the choice of the variable identified as a \u201ctime\u201d. This question is closely related to the issue of time in classical and quantum gravity. Indeed, already at the classical level, general relativity does not allow in general to isolate a physical variable as a preferred time in the infinity of possible choices of \u201ccoordinated time\u201d, and experimentally this is always the evolution of a physical variable, for a given problem, which defines a particular\nnotion of the clock. Notice that this point of view is in agreement with the standard relational interpretation, where space and time are understood as relative special configurations of some fields, used as \u201cclock\u201d and \u201crulers\u201d [34]. An intriguing relation between the choice of a physical time and the definition of equilibrium states has been proposed in the series of works [8, 82\u201386]. For instance, it is shown that the statistical properties of the cosmic radiation background reveal a preferred time, which happens to be the \u201ccosmic time\" considered in the literature. A discussion for quantum theories is given in [87], where authors consider the one-parameter group of automorphism underlying by von Neumann algebra of quantum systems through Tomita-Takesaki theorem, as a single-out time flow. Thermal equilibrium states have been already considered for GFTs, especially in the context of cosmology, see [88] and references therein for an extended discussion about relational functional dynamics. However, except for these special configurations, no preferred time is expected at the fundamental level for a background-independent quantum theory of gravitation. Indeed, the structured space-time manifold is assumed to be entirely dissolved at the phase transition points where collective states of gravity quantum modes are not suitably described by Bose-Einstein condensates, and the concept of \u201cdirection\u201d disappears as the concept of a smooth manifold. Phase transition in the GFTs is for this reason generally understood as a change of the theoretical paradigm \u2013 i.e., as the identification of some regions of the phase space where the collective behavior of quantum gravity atoms can be approached with an effective, semi-classical theory, as a quantum gravity condensate for current cosmological solutions discussed previously. A way to recover a notion of temporality even approximates is through the notion of relational (space)-time, which is already found in classical GR. The contiguity relations between fields allow us to define space-time properties and, in particular, the coupling with gravitation defines the metric field. In that point of view, matter fields can be used to construct material frames locally, one of them playing the role of physical time. Let us recall how that works in the classical setting. Consider a theory involving N fields \u03d5i(x0, x\u20d7), for i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N and (x0, x\u20d7) are arbitrary coordinates for space-time evens. In concrete experiments, clocks and other reference frames are defined as specific configurations of four of these fields, which are assumed to behave as classically as to define such a reference frame and we denote them as \u03d50, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03d53. To be a good reference frame, we assume that locally space-time coordinates x\u00b5 can be expressed uniquely in terms of the four numbers \u03d5\u00b5. In particular, x0 = F0(\u03d50, \u03d51, \u03d52, \u03d53), and, we can express the equations of motions for the remaining fields in terms of the physical coordinates (\u03d50, \u03d5\u20d7 ) [8, 87]. This relational viewpoint can be expected to survive when the gravitational field is described in a quantum manner, at least in a certain regime. An auxiliary (discretized) matter field could play the role of a clock, as long as one can neglect the quantum character of this field. One can expect that such a regime would allow describing the (relational) dynamics of space-time towards or from the emergence of classical space-time, but the transition point (geometrogenesis), where the quantum nature of all fields cannot be neglected, breaks the dynamical description. For more details on the concept of emergence of time in quantum gravity, the reader may\nconsult for instance [34, 35]. Recent application of relational time for TGFTs in the context of quantum cosmology can be found in [36, 77, 89\u201391].\nIn the mathematical formalism presented in this paper, the GFT is quantized by a stochastic equation. This dynamics can be rewritten as a functional integral by the method detailed in the section 2.2, where time appears formally as a scalar variable, and the corresponding field theory is identified with a GFTs on the structure group G\u00d7d \u00d7 R, considered for instance in [89, 91] as describing a scalar field coupled to gravity. In this paper, intended to be the first of a series, we provide the foundations of the formalism. We consider an Abelian TGFT without closure constraint, whose structure group will be U(1), and whose equilibrium states will correspond to a GFT without matter degree of freedom, just-renormalizable in rank d = 5. This choice may seem a bit artificial since the GFTs selected as physically realistic candidates for quantum gravity are based on non-Abelian groups, and incorporate a certain number of constraints such as the closure constraint or Plebanski\u2019s constraint [29]. However, our goal in this paper is essential to show how the RG methods we have developed can be adapted to a new situation, such as a stochastic GFT, and to understand what this new approach can bring compared to the traditional point of view, for a model where these techniques can be more easily handled. Thus, this paper should be seen as the first of a series of explorations, and we will focus essentially on aspects related to the combinatorics of interactions in the construction of the RG1. Our approach in this paper is essentially based on the nonperturbative RG (NPRG) formalism [92\u201396], and construct approximate solutions of the exact Wetterich equation using both effective vertex expansion (EVE) recently introduced in the GFTs context [62\u201365, 67, 97, 98], and Ward\u2019s identities to determine the derivative of the effective vertices with respect to the external momentum, involved in the computation of the anomalous dimension. The resulting equations are then analyzed numerically. The most relevant feature of this formalism is the existence of an intrinsic scaling provided by time evolution, which allows for coarse-grain random degrees of freedom in the frequency space. Besides we focus on TGFTs, we expect the same formalism should be used to investigate analogue regimes for theories with trivial propagators (i.e., without intrinsic scaling), as RMMs and RTMs, which will be the topic of forthcoming work.\n1However, let us also note that an Abelian GFT with trivial propagator and \u039b cut-off in moment is nothing more than a rank 5 random tensor model in disguise. In this respect, we can abusively speak about \u201cpure gravity model\u201d for equilibrium states, in reference on the fact that no degree of freedom for matter field are included.\nOutline. In the section (2) we define the model and provide the path integral approach allowing us to well define the functional renormalization group applicable with the so-called Wetterich equation. In section (3) we introduce the FRG formalism and the time reflection symmetry and causality which allows for coarse-grain by modifying the original Langevin equation. This also helps to add in the Langevin equation a driving force which depends non locally on the standard time on the classical trajectory and preserves causality. We also provide the scaling dimension of the model. In section (4), we use standard local potential approximation to construct solutions of the exact RG equation. We consider two approximations, the first is the crude truncation and the second comes from the effective vertex expansion in the leading order melonic approximation. In section (5) we study the symmetry of our model given by the Ward identities and provide the rigorous analysis of compatibility with the flow equation and the optimal choices of the regulators. Section (6) is deserving of the numerical analysis. We conclude our work in section (7)."

(2.1)\nUsually K = C,R. In this paper, we focus on complex group fields, K \u2261 C. To shorten the notations, we will denote by g := (g1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , gd) the elements of (G)\u00d7d and by \u03c6(g) the value taken by the field at the point g. We generally assume \u03c6 to be a square-integrable function, and the standard L2((G)\u00d7d) inner product:\n(\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032) := \u222b dg \u03c6\u0304(g)\u03c6\u2032(g) (2.2)\nis assumed to be bounded: \u2225\u03c6\u2225 := (\u03c6, \u03c6) < \u221e. In these notations, \u03c6\u0304 designates the standard complex conjugation of \u03c6 and:\ndg := dg1dg2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 dgd , (2.3)\nwhere dg\u2113 is the Haar measure over G. We will suppose that this field is moreover a dynamic variable, depending on a parameter t \u2208 R called the \u201ctime\u201d. The evolution\nof the field is postulate to satisfy the dissipative Langevin equation, which is given by the following:\n\u03c6\u0307(g, t) = \u2212\u2126 \u2202 \u2202\u03c6\u0304(g, t)H[\u03c6, \u03c6\u0304] + \u03b7(g, t) , (2.4)\nwhere \u03b7(g, t) is a random group field, playing the role of white noise, \u2126 > 0 is a time scale, the notation \"dot\" means d/dt and H, the Hamiltonian, defines the deterministic parts of the equation.\nRemark 1 Before continuing with the definition of the model, let us make a small general remark about our point of view in this paper. The so-called time here is not standard as it is in the literature for GFTs, where relational time is usually implemented via clock fields implying second derivatives with respect to this time [91]. In this respect, time evolution could be viewed as \u201cnon-relativistic\" at this stage, but we expect that such a point of view is meaningless here. Indeed, general covariance is not scheduled in our construction and would probably require additional degrees of freedom to be discussed, as is the case in more complete and physical GFT models. One could imagine that the Langevin equation derives from a kind of \u201cslow rolling\u201d approximation, a bit like for stochastic inflation, for an equation preserving a sort of general covariance. However, such an approximation might be a bit too hasty in the absence of more serious investigations, and we believe that talking about covariance or a \"non-relativistic\" regime does not (yet) make sense in the present framework. We will thus simply say that 2.4 our model is a simple model allowing us to study the fluctuations around some equilibrium state with respect to which a preferred time is defined.\nWithout additional constraint on the random field \u03c6, we assume that the probability measure for \u03b7(g, t) is:\nd\u03c1(\u03b7) := 1 z0\nexp (\n\u2212 1\u2126\n\u222b dtdg \u03b7\u0304(g, t)\u03b7(g, t) ) d[\u03b7] , (2.5)\nwhere d[\u03b7] := \u220f\ng,t d\u03b7(g, t)d\u03b7\u0304(g, t) is the formal functional measure defining path integral, and the normalization z0 being such that:\n\u27e8\u03b7(g, t)\u03b7\u0304(g\u2032, t\u2032)\u27e9\u03b7 = \u2126 \u03b4(g\u2032(g)\u22121)\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032) , (2.6)\nthe notation \u27e8X\u27e9\u03b7 meaning average over \u03b7 with probability density d\u03c1(\u03b7)/d[\u03b7], and:\n\u03b4(g\u2032(g)\u22121) := d\u220f\n\u2113=1\n\u03b4(g\u2032\u2113g\u22121\u2113 ) , (2.7)\nwhere \u03b4(g\u2113g\u22121\u2113 ) denotes the standard Dirac delta over G,\u222b dg \u03b4(g\u2032(g)\u22121)f(g) = f(g\u2032) , (2.8)\nfor some function f . The Hamiltonian H will be designed such that equilibrium configurations (see Section 2.2) reproduce the generalized Gibbs states used in standard definitions of GFTs. With the previous definition, long time equilibrium states (i.e., the probabilioty density for a field configuration) must behave like P [\u03c6, \u03c6\u0304] \u223c e\u22122H[\u03c6,\u03c6\u0304], accordingly to the usual definition provided that H is nothing but the microscopic action for group field. Because we focus on the TGFT formalism, we expect H is the sum of two contributions:\n1. A kinetic part Hkin, involving a non-trivial kernel depending on the LaplaceBeltrami operator \u2206g over the manifold (G)\u00d7d:\nHkin[\u03c6, \u03c6\u0304] := \u222b dg \u03c6\u0304(g, t)(\u2212\u2206g + m2)\u03c6(g, t) , (2.9)\nfor some coupling constant m2 defining a mass scale.\n2. An interaction Hint, which expands in power of fields. The terms involved in that expansion, as the interaction Hamiltonian itself are furthermore assumed to be invariants under unitary transformations U : L2(G) \u2192 L2(G) defined as:\n\u03c6(g) \u2192 \u03c6\u2032(g) := \u222b dg\u2032 [ d\u220f\n\u2113=1\nU\u2113(g\u2113, g\u2032\u2113) ] \u03c6(g\u2032) . (2.10)\nThis defines a particular non-locality for interactions, called \u201ctensoriality\u201d, and terms involved in the expansion of H are tensorial invariants.\nThese invariants admit an elegant representation in terms of d-colored bipartite regular graphs. The receipt is the following:\n1. To each field \u03c6 and \u03c6\u0304 we assign a black and white dot respectively, with d halfcolored edges hooked to them, materializing the d group variables g1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , gd:\n\u03d5(g1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , gd) g1 g2 g3\ngd \u03d5\u0304(g1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , gd) g1\ng2 g3\ngd .\n2. Colored edges are then hooked together, accordingly with their respective colors, between black and white dots only.\nOn Figure 1 we show some examples for d = 3. To provide an explicit example, the first diagram reads explicitly as:\n\u2261 \u222b 3\u220f\ni=1\ndgidg \u2032 i\u03c6(g1, g2, g3)\u03c6\u0304(g1, g\u20322, g\u20323)\u03c6(g\u20321, g\u20322, g\u20323)\u03c6\u0304(g\u20321, g2, g3) , (2.11)\nassuming that the red edge corresponds to color 1. As illustrated by the last example in Figure 1, graphs can be connected or not, and in this case, they are the product\nof connected graphs. We call a bubble such a connected graph, made of a single piece. We moreover assume that Hint expands as:\nHint[\u03c6, \u03c6\u0304] = \u2211\nb\n\u03bbbTrb[\u03c6(t), \u03c6\u0304(t)] , (2.12)\nthe sum running over bubbles b involving more than 2 fields, and Trb[\u03c6, \u03c6\u0304] denotes the corresponding tensorial invariant. Long time equilibrium states (i.e., the probability density that a group field \u03c6 has a given value in the \u201cvolume\u201d2 D[\u03c6] := \u220f g d\u03c6(g)d\u03c6\u0304(g), if it exists, must behave like (see Section 2.2):\n\u03c1[\u03c6, \u03c6\u0304] = 1 Z[{\u03bbb}] e\u22122H[\u03c6,\u03c6\u0304] , (2.13)\nthe partition function Z[{\u03bbb}] which normalizes the state is given by the formal path integral over field configurations:\nZ[{\u03bbb}] := \u222b D[\u03c6] e\u22122H[\u03c6,\u03c6\u0304] . (2.14)\nHence, the time variable is related to the definition of equilibrium states given by (2.13), accordingly with the point of view of [82, 83], and we are aiming to study small perturbations with respect to it, described by the Langevin equation (2.4). The perturbative expansion of the partition function organizes as a sum over quantum amplitudes that we denote as A(G), labeled with vacuum Feynman graphs G. An example of such a Feynman graph is provided by Figure 2, the dotted edges materializing Wick contractions with free propagator C(g, g\u2032),\nC(g, g\u2032) := 12 \u222b +\u221e 1/\u039b2 d\u03b1e\u2212\u03b1m 2 d\u220f \u2113=1 K\u03b1(g\u2032\u2113(g\u2113)\u22121) , (2.15)\nfor some UV cut-off \u039b, K\u03b1(g\u2032(g)\u22121) denotes the heat kernel, solution of the equation: \u2202\n\u2202\u03b1 K\u03b1(g) = \u2206gK\u03b1(g) , (2.16)\nwith boundary conditions K\u03b1\u21920(g\u2032(g)\u22121) = \u03b4(g\u2032(g)\u22121). Feynman graphs like the one pictured in Figure 2 look like bipartite regular (d + 1)-colored graphs, attributing the color \u201c0\u201d to the dotted edges. A very important notion for such a graph is the faces, and we recall the definition here:\n2We use the notation \"d\" for the functional measure of time-dependent states, and the notation \"D\" for equilibrium, time-independent configurations.\nDefinition 1 A face f is a bi-colored cycle (including color 0), indexed by a couple (\u2113, \u2113\u2032), \u2113 \u0338= \u2113\u2032. Such a cycle may be open (open face) or closed (closed face). The boundary of a face, \u2202f is the set of colored edges along the cycle.\nIn the rest of this article, we will focus on the compact Abelian group G = U(1), and we normalize the Haar measure as:\u222b\ndg = 1 . (2.17)\nThe group is isomorphic to the unit circle, and each element of the group can be represented by g \u2208 U(1) \u2261 ei\u03b8 \u2208 S1, where \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0[. Irreducible representations of the group are therefore eip\u03b8 for p \u2208 Z, and the standard Peter-Weyl theorem allows decomposing functions over the group manifold U(1) along this basis. For the heat kernel, for instance, we have:\nK\u03b1(g) \u2223\u2223 g\u2261ei\u03b8 = \u2211 p\u2208Z e\u2212\u03b1p 2 eip\u03b8 , (2.18)\nand the propagator in the Fourier representation reads:\nC(p, p\u2032) = 12 \u03b4pp\u2032 p2 + m2 , (2.19)\nwhere p \u2208 Zd, p2 := \u2211d\n\u2113=1 p 2 \u2113 and \u03b4pp \u2032 := \u220fd \u2113=1 \u03b4p\u2113p\u2032\u2113 . This theory has the property\nto be power countable, and we have the following statement [31, 32, 99, 100]:\nProposition 1 Let A(G) the regularized Feynman amplitude associated with a Feynman diagram G, with L(G) dotted edges and F (G) closed faces of type (0\u2113), \u2113 \u2208 J1, dK. Its dependence on the UV cut-off \u039b is given by:\n|A(G)| \u223c \u039b\u03c9(G) , (2.20)\nwhere: \u03c9(G) = \u22122L(G) + F (G) . (2.21)\nLeading order graphs are those for which \u03c9 is optimal. The diagrams that make this counting optimal are called melons, and can be defined by a simple recursion, see [32, 97] and section 4.2. Melonic graphs are those for which the number of faces is maximal as L(G) fixed. We can show that for these diagrams the number V (G) of vertices is related to the numbers F (G) and L(G) by [32, 97]:\nF (G) = (d \u2212 1)(L(G) \u2212 V (G) + 1) . (2.22)\nHence, defining \u03c1 := (d \u2212 1)(L(G) \u2212 V (G) + 1) \u2212 F , it can be established that the power counting can be read as:\n\u03c9(G) = \u2211\nk\n((d \u2212 3)k \u2212 (d \u2212 1))vk(G) + (d \u2212 1) \u2212 N(G)\n2 (d \u2212 3) \u2212 \u03c1(G) . (2.23)\nIn that equation, vk(G) denotes the number of bubbles with valence 2k (with k white nodes), and N(G) is the number of external edges.\nDefinition 2 For melonic diagrams \u03c1(G) = 0, and it can be proved that \u03c1(G) > 0 otherwise.\nThe theory will be power-counting just renormalizable if and only if (d \u2212 3)k \u2212 (d \u2212 1) = 0. In particular, the sixtic model is just-renormalizable for d = 4. In this paper, we will focus on the melonic quartic model, which is just-renormalizable for d = 5, where power-counting reads as:\n\u03c9melon = 4 \u2212 N(G) . (2.24)\nIn particular, only 2 and 4-points diagrams are power-counting divergent and require to be renormalized. The melonic diagrams have the property to be contractible. This property invites the definition of a locality principle, and tensorial invariants which are connected and contractible are said to be local in that point of view. We will speak of traciality to designate this specific notion of locality. This principle of locality allows us to define counter-terms, and we can show the following theorem [99, 100]:\nTheorem 1 The quartic melonic model in d = 5 is just-renormalizable, and divergences can be removed with counter-terms for mass, quartic couplings and field strength normalization.\nExplicitly, the renormalizable Hamiltonian reads as:\nH[\u03c6, \u03c6\u0304] := \u222b dg \u03c6\u0304(g)(\u2212\u2206g + m2)\u03c6(g) + \u03bb 5\u2211\n\u2113=1 `\n\u03d5\u0304\n\u03d5\u0304\n\u03d5\n\u03d5\n, (2.25)\nwhere we attributed the same coupling constant for all the quartic interactions. Traciality allows us to think of locality in that context, as related to tensorial invariance, and we adopt the following definition in this paper:\nDefinition 3 Any tensorial invariant whose graph is a bubble is said to be local. In the same way, any function which expands as a sum of terms labeled with bubbles only will say to be local."

Due to the randomness of the white noise \u03b7(g, t), trajectories can be suitably described through a probability distribution:\nP (q, t; q\u2032, t\u2032) = \u2329 \u03b4(q(t) \u2212 q) \u232a \u03b7 , (2.26)\nfor t > t\u2032, assuming the initial condition q(t\u2032) = q\u2032. In the rest of the paper, we will use the shortest notation P (q, t) for P (q, t; q\u2032, t\u2032), disregarding the initial state. The Langevin equation (2.4) being local in time, equation (2.26) define a Markov-process whose evolution follows a Fokker-Planck equation [37]:\n\u2202\n\u2202t P (q, t) = \u2126H\u0302P (q, t) , (2.27)\nwith: H\u0302 := \u222b dg ( \u03b42\n\u03b4\u03c6(g)\u2202\u03c6\u0304(g) + 2 \u03b42H \u03b4\u03c6(g)\u2202\u03c6\u0304(g) + \u03b4H \u03b4\u03c6(g) \u03b4 \u03b4\u03c6\u0304(g) + \u03b4H \u03b4\u03c6\u0304(g) \u03b4 \u03b4\u03c6(g)\n) .\n(2.28) This equation admits a long time equilibrium solution, if it exists, this solution is given by:\n\u03c1(q) := lim t\u2192+\u221e P (q, t; q\u2032, t\u2032) , (2.29)\nwhich corresponds to stationary solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, and it is easy to check that: \u03c1(q) \u223c e\u22122H, accordingly with equation (2.13). This equilibrium solution exists provided that it is normalizable, i.e., that the integral (2.14) exists. The transition probability P (q, t; q\u2032, t\u2032) can be represented as a path integral. We introduce it here with some details \u2013 see [37, 81] for a complement. The basic ingredient is the following formal relation3\n1 \u2261 \u222b dq \u03b4 (\u03c6\u0307 + \u03b4\u03c6\u0304H\u2032 \u2212 \u03b7) \u03b4 ( \u02d9\u0304\u03c6 + \u03b4\u03c6H\u2032 \u2212 \u03b7\u0304) (det M)2 , (2.30)\nwhere H\u2032 := \u2126H, M is the operator-matrix with entries:\nM(g\u2032, t\u2032; g, t) := \u03b4(g\u2032(g)\u22121) d dt\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032) + \u03b4 2H\u2032\n\u03b4\u03c6\u0304(g, t)\u03b4\u03c6(g\u2032, t\u2032) . (2.31)\n3Note that the Langevin equation that we consider is a first order differential equation, admitting a single causal solution, see [37]. This uniqueness can be challenged for some non-equilibrium configurations, whose classical action admits a large number of minima.\nWe can then use this representation of the identity to determine the classical action associated with the Markov process, by rewriting the generating function:\nZ[J, J\u0304 ] := \u2329 exp (\u222b dtdgJ(g, t)\u03c6\u0304(g, t) + \u222b dtdgJ\u0304(g, t)\u03c6(g, t) )\u232a\n\u03b7\n. (2.32)\nNote that, because of the normalization for the averaging over \u03b7, we must have Z[J = 0, J\u0304 = 0] = 1, fixing the normalization; moreover q(t) is assumed to be a solution of the motion equation for some initial conditions. It can be suitable to take the initial condition for t\u2032 = \u2212\u221e, to ensure that the distribution is in equilibrium (if it exists). We introduce the shortest notation J(t) = {J\u0304(g, t), J(g, t)} and we define the dot product:\nJ \u00b7 q := \u222b dtdg\u03c6\u0304(g, t)J(g, t) + \u222b dtdgJ\u0304(g, t)\u03c6(g, t) . (2.33)\nIntroducing the identity (2.30) in the previous equation, it becomes:\nZ[J, J\u0304 ] = \u222b dqd\u03c1(\u03b7) eJ \u00b7q\u03b4 (\u03c6\u0307 + \u03b4\u03c6\u0304H\u2032 \u2212 \u03b7) \u03b4 ( \u02d9\u0304\u03c6 + \u03b4\u03c6H\u2032 \u2212 \u03b7\u0304) (det M)2 . (2.34)\nThe delta functions can be easily integrated out, and to compute the determinant we can use the well-known formula det M = exp(Tr ln(M)). One can easily check that:\ndet M \u223c exp ( \u03b8(0) \u222b dtdg \u22022H\u2032\n\u2202\u03c6\u0304(g, t)\u2202\u03c6(g, t)\n) . (2.35)\nIn this equation, the choice of this function as the inverse of \u2202/\u2202t is required by causality (which is expected from the Langevin equation). However, a problem arises because \u03b8(0) is undefined. There are two allowed solutions, depending on if we use \u00ceto or Stratonovich prescription for computing time discretized version of path integrals [37, 101, 102]:\n1. In the \u00ceto sense, we evaluate the integrand at the left end point.\n2. In the Stratonovich sense, we evaluate the integrand at the \u201cmiddle\u201d point.\nEach of these choices corresponds to a different convention for \u03b8(0). Thus, \u03b8(0) = 0 for \u00ceto, and \u03b8(0) = 1/2 for Stratonovich. In this paper, we will work within \u00ceto convention, and we set (det M)2 = 1 in the calculations, leading to:\nZ[J, J\u0304 ] = \u222b dq e\u2212 1 \u2126 \u222b dtdg(\u03c6\u0307+\u03b4\u03c6\u0304H\u2032)( \u02d9\u0304\u03c6+\u03b4\u03c6H\u2032)+J \u00b7q . (2.36)\nAs a final step, we introduce a complex intermediate group field, \u03c7, called response field, such that Z[J, J\u0304 ] can be rewritten as, using basic properties of Gaussian integration:\nZ[J, J\u0304 , \u0237, \u0237\u0304] = \u222b dqd\u03c7 e\u2212\u2126 2S[q,\u03c7]+J \u00b7q+\u0237\u00b7\u03c7 . (2.37)\nwhere we introduced a source \u0237 = (\u0237, \u0237\u0304 ) for the response field, and where the complex classical action S[q, \u03c7] is given by:\n\u21262S[q, \u03c7] := \u222b dtdg [ \u2126\u03c7\u0304(g, t)\u03c7(g, t)+i\u03c7\u0304(g, t) ( \u03c6\u0307 + \u2126\u03b4\u03c6\u0304H\u0303 ) (g, t)\n+ i ( \u02d9\u0304\u03c6 + \u2126\u03b4\u03c6H\u0303) (g, t)\u03c7(g, t)] . (2.38)\nIt will be useful in the following to work in the Fourier representation. We will note Tp(\u03c9) (resp. T\u0304p(\u03c9)) the Fourier components of \u03c6(g, t) (resp. \u03c6\u0304(g, t)), where p \u2208 Zd, such that:\n\u03c6(g, t) = \u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03c9\u221a 2\u03c0 e\u2212i\u03c9t \u2211 p\u2208Zd Tp(\u03c9) d\u220f \u2113=1 eip\u2113\u03b8\u2113 , (2.39)\nwhere ei\u03b8\u2113 := g\u2113. In that way, the full Hamiltonian H\u0303 reads: H\u0303[T, T\u0304 ] := \u2211 p\u2208Z5 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 T\u0304p(\u03c9)(p2 + m2)Tp(\u03c9) (2.40)\n+ \u03bb2\u03c0 5\u2211 \u2113=1 \u2211 {pi} \u222b 4\u220f i=1 d\u03c9i\u03b4(\u03c91 + \u03c93 \u2212 \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c94)W(\u2113)p1,p2,p3,p4Tp1(\u03c91)T\u0304p2(\u03c92)Tp3(\u03c93)T\u0304p4(\u03c94) ,\nwhere we introduced the symbols W(\u2113)p1,p2,p3,p4 defined as:\nW(\u2113)p1,p2,p3,p4 := \u03b4p1\u2113p4\u2113\u03b4p2\u2113p3\u2113 \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4p1jp2j \u03b4p3jp4j . (2.41)\nHence, S[q, \u03c7] splits as: S =: Skin + Sint , (2.42)\nwhere,\nSkin = \u2211 p\u2208Z5 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9\u0302 ( \u03c7\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302)\u03c7p(\u03c9\u0302) + i\u03c7\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302) ( \u2212i\u03c9\u0302 + p2 + m2 ) Tp(\u03c9\u0302)\n+ iT\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302) ( i\u03c9\u0302 + p2 + m2 ) \u03c7p(\u03c9\u0302) ) , (2.43)\nand:\nSint = i\u03bb\n4\u03c0 d\u2211 \u2113=1  ` \u03c7\u0304\n\u03d5\u0304\n\u03d5\n\u03d5\n+ `\n\u03d5\u0304\n\u03d5\u0304\n\u03c7\n\u03d5  , (2.44) where in the previous equation we introduced the graphical rule according to which the response fields \u03c7 and \u03c7\u0304 will be materialized by black and white square nodes respectively, and where we introduced the dimensionless frequency \u03c9 \u2261 \u2126\u03c9\u0302.\nThe free propagator C takes the form of a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix, with components C\u03c7\u03c7\u0304, CT \u03c7\u0304, C\u03c7T\u0304 and CT T\u0304 . It is easy to check that the response field does not propagate, i.e., C\u03c7\u03c7\u0304(\u03c9\u0302, p2) = 0 . (2.45) Other components are given by:\nC\u03c7\u0304T (\u03c9\u0302, p2) = 1 \u21262 \u03c9\u0302 \u2212 i(p2 + m2) \u03c9\u03022 + (p2 + m2)2 , CT\u0304 \u03c7(\u03c9\u0302, p 2) = \u2212 1\u21262 \u03c9\u0302 + i(p2 + m2) \u03c9\u03022 + (p2 + m2)2 , (2.46)\nand: CT T\u0304 (\u03c9\u0302, p2) =\n1 \u21262 1 \u03c9\u03022 + (p2 + m2)2 . (2.47)\nThe result (2.45) valid at order zero in the perturbative expansion survives to all orders, and is in fact an exact, non perturbative relation [103], meaning that component \u03c7\u03c7\u0304 of the exact propagator G (or equivalently the component T\u0304 T of the mass matrix \u0393(2)) vanishes:\nG\u03c7\u03c7\u0304(\u03c9\u0302, p2) = 0 . (2.48)\nThe origin of this relation can be traced as follows. Let us consider Z[J, J\u0304 , \u0237, \u0237\u0304] the generating functional (2.37). Let us add a linear driving force 1\u2126 \u222b dt \u2211\np k\u0304p(t)Tp(t)+ c.c to the Hamiltonian H. This is equivalent to translating sources \u0237 and \u0237\u0304 as:\n\u0237p \u2192 \u0237p \u2212 ikp , \u0237\u0304p \u2192 \u0237\u0304p + ik\u0304p . (2.49)\nHence from the normalization conditions of the partition function we must have Z[0, 0, \u2212ik, ik\u0304] = 1, and therefore:\nG\u03c7\u03c7\u0304 = \u2212 \u03b42 \u03b4kp\u03b4k\u0304p\u2032 Z[0, 0, \u2212ik, ik\u0304] \u2261 \u2212 \u03b4 21 \u03b4kp\u03b4k\u0304p\u2032 = 0 . (2.50)\nIn the rest of this paper, we fix the original timescale such that \u2126 = 1, keeping the dependency over \u2126 explicit only for technical points.Such a choice simplifies all the expressions before."

            "text": "The RG as conceived by Wilson and Kadanoff aims to interpolate between a microscopic model and a macroscopic, effective description. The effective description is constructed by integrating out quantum or thermodynamic fluctuation scale by scale, integrating out firstly the modes having a small wavelength and ending with the ones having a large wavelength. This paradigm generally focuses on equilibrium physics. For non-equilibrium systems, temporal fluctuations can no longer be ignored. There are then two possible attitudes:\n\u2022 Consider a coarse-graining only on the group variables (i.e., on the spectrum of the Laplacian \u2206g).\n\u2022 Or include the time to the notion of scale, and integrate partially on both the spectrum of the operators \u2212i\u2202/\u2202t and \u2206g.\nWe can still imagine partially integrating only on the \u03c9 frequencies by integrating on the whole spectrum of \u2206g. But we will not consider this possibility in the following. The possibility of a coarse-graining in frequency has been considered in [104] through the Wetterich framework, about non-equilibrium systems and in [105], about a disordered Langevin type equation. Other approaches considering a frequency coarse-graining have been considered, notably for quantum mechanical problems [106, 107], inflation theory [108], Brownian motion [109, 110], dissipative (open) quantum system [111\u2013113] and references therein. The reader can also consult the recent review [96]. In this paper, we follow the same strategy, and we focus on a coarse-graining both in frequency \u03c9 and momenta p, that interpolates between two regimes:\n1. The UV regime, where fluctuations are frozen and fields configurations are determined by stationary points of the classical action S.\n2. The IR regime, where fluctuations are all integrated out and field configurations described through the effective action \u0393, the Legendre transform of the Gibbs free energy.\nThe standard procedure is to add a regulator to the classical action S, which has generally the form:\n\u2206Sk = \u2211 p\u2208Zd \u2211 a,b \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 \u039e\u0304a(p, \u03c9)Rab,k(p, \u03c9)\u039eb(p, \u03c9) , (3.1)\nwhere \u039e(p, \u03c9) = (\u03c7p(\u03c9), Tp(\u03c9)). The regulator Rab,k(p, \u03c9) assumed to be a differentiable function of k, p and \u03c9. It behaves as a scale-dependent mass and is designed such that high energy modes concerning the scale k (i.e., such that \u03c9\u0302/k2, p2/k2 \u226a 1) receive a small mass whereas low energy modes are essentially frozen, decoupling\nthem from long range physics. In such a way, we are expecting to construct a smooth interpolation \u0393k between microscopic physics described by classical action \u21262S for k = \u039b and macroscopic physics described by effective action \u0393 \u2013 the Legendre transform of the Gibbs free energy\u2014for k = 0. We introduce the mathematical definition of the effective average action \u0393k:\n\u0393k[M , \u03c3] + \u2206Sk[M , \u03c3] = M \u00b7 J + \u03c3 \u00b7 \u0237 \u2212 Wk[J , \u0237 ] , (3.2)\nwhere M := (M\u0304, M) and \u03c3 := (\u03c3\u0304, \u03c3) denote the classical fields i.e.\nM := \u03b4Wk \u03b4J\u0304 , \u03c3 := \u03b4Wk \u03b4j\u0304 . (3.3)\nThe microscopic scale \u039b is assumed to be large enough, and we will take the continuum limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e in the computation of the \u03b2-function. For the equilibrium distributions, this limit makes sense because the model that we consider is justrenormalizable and asymptotically free [100, 114]. In the deep IR regime, for k \u223c 0, one expects that regulator Rab,k almost vanish, ensuring that symmetries, in particular, should be ultimately restored, at least formally, for the exact RG equation [95]:\n\u2202\n\u2202k \u0393k = Tr \u2202Rk \u2202k (\u0393(2)k + Rk)\u22121 , (3.4)\nwhere capital bold letters designate 2\u00d72 matrix-valued functions and the trace runs over all the fields indices. Note that the expression assumes implicitly that \u2126 = 1, and we define the effective propagator Gk as:\nGk := (\u0393(2)k + Rk)\u22121 . (3.5)\nThe situation is however not so easy, because equation (3.4) cannot be solved exactly, even for very simple models, and approximations currently considered solving it, introduce a spurious dependency on the regulator for IR quantities [115, 116]. In this paper, we will consider the minimal sensitivity prescription (MSP) as a reliability criterion to quantify the dependency on the regulator, see [104, 117, 118]. Methods usually considered for solving flow equations are called truncation and project them along a finite-dimensional subspace. The choice of this finite-dimensional subspace depends on physical constraints and symmetries expected to be unbroken along the flow, up to IR scales. This can be achieved by demanding that the regulator preserve the original symmetries of the classical action, i.e. that Ward-Takahashi (WT) identities remain unchanged along the flow [119]. This condition however is usually too restrictive, and in many situations, symmetries are only restored in the deep IR, making the dependency on the regulator difficult to avoid. This is especially the case for gauge theories [120], another unconventional example being provided by RMMs and RTMs [46, 47]. In that paper, we only consider regulator compatibles with time-reversal symmetry preserved along the flow, but not only asymptotically. Time-reversal symmetry is expected because we assume to consider only equilibrium dynamics, starting with a generalized Gibbs state \u03c1(q) and relaxing toward equilibrium [37]."

            "text": "A way to construct coarse-graining is to modify the original Langevin equation (2.4), adding to it a non-local driving force (see [104] for more detail):\nT\u0307p(t) = \u2212\u2126 \u2202H\n\u2202T\u0304p(t) \u2212 fp(t, [q(t)]) + \u03b7p(t) , (3.6)\nwhere the driving force f is non-local in time and takes the form: fp(t, [q(t)]) := \u222b dt\u2032R (1) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032)Tp(t\u2032) , (3.7)\nwhere R(1)k is assumed to be a real kernel. The effect of this force is to \u201cfreeze\u201d IR contributions. In addition, we modify the noise correlation function, adding to it a non-local contribution introducing a short memory in the system:\n\u27e8\u03b7(g, t)\u03b7\u0304(g\u2032, t\u2032)\u27e9 = \u2126 \u03b4(g\u2032(g)\u22121) [ \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032) + 1\u2126R (2) k (t \u2212 t\u2032) ] . (3.8)\nFollowing the same steps as for the deduction of the generating functional (2.37), we find: Zk[J, J\u0304 , \u0237, \u0237\u0304 ] := \u222b dqd\u03c7 e\u2212\u2126 2S[q,\u03c7]\u2212\u2206Sk[q,\u03c7]+J \u00b7q+\u0237\u00b7\u03c7 .

(3.12)\nThe partition function has the expected form. There are however two physical constraints to take into account. Causality and time-reversal symmetry, are closely related to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) [103, 121, 122]. Note that the Langevin equation (2.4) being of the first order, admits only one causal solution. We will describe the constraints on the regulator so that these physical conditions are preserved by the regularized theory, i.e. so that the effective models along the RG flow still describe an equilibrium dynamics compatible with causality. Note that this construction ensures that the component \u03c7\u0304\u03c7 of propagator (3.5) vanishes, Gk,\u03c7\u0304\u03c7 = 0.\nTime-reversal symmetry and FDT. The time-reflection symmetry is a direct consequence of this equilibrium dynamics, to which we will limit ourselves in this paper. It is realized by the following transformations on the fields \u039e \u2192 \u039e\u2032 for the non-regularized theory (Rk = 0) as:\nT \u2032p(t) = Tp(\u2212t) , \u03c7\u2032p(t) = \u03c7p(\u2212t) + 2i \u2126 T\u0307p(\u2212t) , (3.13)\nand: T\u0304 \u2032p(t) = T\u0304p(\u2212t) , \u03c7\u0304\u2032p(t) = \u03c7\u0304p(\u2212t) +\n2i \u2126 \u02d9\u0304Tp(\u2212t) . (3.14)\nIt is easy to see that these transformations leave the non-regularized classical action S[q, \u03c7] invariant, within total derivatives. Moreover, the Jacobian of the transformation being equaled to 1, the path integral defining the partition function is invariant as well for zero external sources. The transformations of the source terms into counterparts give a certain number of relations between observable, from which the classical FDT follows. Let us derive it from the expected invariance of the functional integral. The source term \u2013 J \u00b7 q + \u0237 \u00b7 \u03c7 \u2013 in (2.37) transforms as:\nJ \u00b7 q + \u0237 \u00b7 \u03c7 \u2192 J\u0303 \u00b7 q + \u0237\u0303 \u00b7 \u03c7 \u2212 2i\u2126 \u2211\np\n\u222b dt ( \u00af\u0303\u0237p(t)T\u0307p(t) + \u0237\u0303p(t) \u02d9\u0304Tp(t) )\n(3.15)\nup to total derivative contributions. We moreover introduced the notation X\u0303(t) := X(\u2212t). We introduce the following definitions:\nRp(t, t\u2032) := \u27e8\u03c7\u0304p(t)Tp(t\u2032)\u27e9 , Dp(t, t\u2032) := \u27e8T\u0304p(t)Tp(t\u2032)\u27e9 , (3.16)\nand the transformation (3.15) leads to the FDT:\nRp(t, t\u2032) \u2212 Rp(\u2212t, \u2212t\u2032) = \u2212 2i \u2126 d dt Dp(t, t\u2032) . (3.17)\nSince Dp(t, t\u2032) is symmetric, and assuming translation invariance, i.e. Rp(t, t\u2032) \u2261 Rp(t \u2212 t\u2032) , this relation be rewritten as:\nRp(t) = \u2212 2i \u2126 \u03b8(t) d dt Dp(t) . (3.18)\nThese relations can be converted to the Fourier representation as:\nG\u03c7\u0304T (\u03c9\u0302, p2) \u2212 G\u03c7\u0304T (\u2212\u03c9\u0302, p2) = 2\u03c9\u0302GT\u0304 T (\u03c9\u0302, p2) . (3.19)\nIt is easy to check that this relation is satisfied, at zero order, by free propagators (2.46) and (2.47). Let us show how the regulator can be compatible with these physical constraints. We would like to construct a regulator \u2206Sk which is compatible with the time reversal i.e. which is invariant under the transformations (3.13) and (3.14). A calculation detailed in Appendix B shows the we must have:\nR (1) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) \u2212 R (1) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032) \u2212 2 \u2126R\u0307 (2) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) = 0 . (3.20)\nIn terms of Fourier components, this relation reads:\nR (1) k (p, \u03c9) \u2212 R (1) k (p, \u2212\u03c9) = \u22122i\u03c9\u0302R (2) k (p, \u03c9) . (3.21)\nFor such a time-reversal symmetric regulator, FDT (3.19) holds for all k.\nCausality. The driving force fp(t, [q(t)]) added to the Langevin equation depending non-locally (in time) on the trajectory q(t), we must have to preserve causality:\nR (1) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032) \u221d \u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032) . (3.22)\nFor the theory without a regulator, the free propagators satisfy non-trivial causality conditions, that can be investigated from the explicit expressions (2.46) and (2.47). For instance, the component C\u03c7\u0304T reads as:\nC\u03c7\u0304T (\u03c9, p2) = 1\n\u03c9 + i(p2 + m2) , (3.23)\nwhich has a single pole \u03c9 = \u2212i(p2 + m2), in the lower half part of the complex part (see Figure 3). Hence, the free 2-point function:\n\u27e8\u03c7\u0304p(t)Tp(t\u2032)\u27e9 = \u222b\nd\u03c9\u221a 2\u03c0\nei\u03c9(t\u2212t \u2032)\n\u03c9 + i(p2 + m2) , (3.24)\nwhich vanish for t \u2212 t\u2032 > 0 from residue theorem. Hence,\n\u27e8\u03c7\u0304p(t)Tp(t\u2032)\u27e9 \u221d \u03b8(t\u2032 \u2212 t) . (3.25)\nNote also that at zero moments, it is the mass that removes the ambiguity on the position of the poles4. This causality will be an important condition to respect in the construction of the nonperturbative RG, and we will impose the effective two-point\n4For a zero mass we should have to regularize with a parameter \u03f5 \u2192 0+ to guarantee causality.\nfunctions to satisfy them, asking that the poles of the functions Gk,T\u0304 \u03c7 and Gk,\u03c7\u0304T are respectively located in the half lower part and the half upper part of the complex plane, as in Figure 3. This condition allows us to understand an important point. In the following sections, we will construct an approximation for the \u0393k functional, through a truncation. Causality allows us to understand that this functional cannot contain independent contributions from the response fields \u03c7 and \u03c7\u0304. In other words, it must necessarily have:\n\u0393k \u2223\u2223 \u03c7=\u03c7\u0304=0 = 0 , \u2200k , (3.26)\na property that we call heteroclicity. We already know that this condition is realized initially for the action S, see (2.38). To show that this contribution is zero, it is therefore sufficient to show that its flow is zero, in other words, that:\nd dk \u0393k \u2223\u2223 \u03c7=\u03c7\u0304=0 = 0 , \u2200k . (3.27)\nThis is easy from (3.4). The flow equation involves three contributions. The first one involves the product\nd\ndk R\n(2) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032)\u27e8\u03c7\u0304p(t)\u03c7p(t\u2032)\u27e9 ,\nvanishes due to the condition (2.48). The second contribution has the form\nd\ndk R\n(1) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032)\u27e8\u03c7\u0304p(t)Tp(t\u2032)\u27e9 ,\nand vanishes because R(1)k (t \u2212 t\u2032) \u221d \u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032) and \u27e8\u03c7\u0304(t)T (t\u2032)\u27e9 \u221d \u03b8(t\u2032 \u2212 t). The third contribution vanishes for the same reason.\nRemark 2 It is important to note that the condition (3.27) is easy to check in the case of coarse-graining in time, as is the case in this paper. It is more subtle in the case where we practice coarse-graining only on moments and not on frequencies. In this case, one must return to the discrete version of the equations in the \u00ceto prescription, see for instance [101]. In this case, we show that the coincident time correlations must be replaced by regularized versions:\n\u27e8\u03c7\u0304p(t)Tp\u2032(t\u2032)\u27e9\u03f5 \u2261 \u27e8\u03c7\u0304p(t + \u03f5)Tp\u2032(t\u2032)\u27e9 , (3.28)\nwhich introduces a factor ei\u03c9\u03f5 in the Fourier integrals. This factor ensures convergence of integrals in the upper or lower part of the complex integrals, and, the previous condition (3.27) follows from the expected position of poles in the integrals, once again as a consequence of causality. Note moreover that the last condition is obvious in the supersymmetric formalism, quite natural in the Stratonovich sense. Supersymmetry, which is ensured by Ward-Takahashi identities for the quantum theory, implies the constant term flows vanish due to the cancellation of bosonic and fermionic loops [105].\nRemark 3 The condition (3.27) can be checked from perturbation theory as follows. Let us focus on the quartic melonic model. Figure 4 lists the expected boundaries for effective vertex functions, which can be generated in leading order from melonic diagrams. Note that all the allowed configurations are not pictured in the Figure. For instance, there exist the same configuration as (a), obtained by reversing the black and white colors of the nodes. We will denote as ( a\u0304) this configuration. Note that some edges are their own deputy. Thus d = d\u0304. Note moreover that only boundaries of type a and a\u0304 are involved in the classical action. At one loop, the boundary diagram d, which does not contain the response field, comes from the diagram pictured in Figure"

The regularized kinetic Lagrangian then reads as:\nSkin = \u2211 p\u2208Z5 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9\u0302 ( \u03c7\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302)\u03c7p(\u03c9\u0302) + i\u03c7\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302) ( \u2212i\u03c9\u0302 + Z\u221ep2 + m2 ) Tp(\u03c9\u0302)\n+ iT\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302) ( i\u03c9\u0302 + Z\u221ep2 + m2 ) \u03c7p(\u03c9\u0302) ) , (3.31)\ndisregarding the renormalization of the response field that we will consider later. The quartic interaction receives counter-terms as well, and in (2.44) we must replace \u03bb \u2192 Z2\u221eZ\u03bb\u03bbr. For this model, the counter-terms Z\u221e and Z\u03bb can be formally computed, as the authors in [65] showed. We recall their conclusions here for selfconsistency:\nProposition 2 With the normalization condition (3.30) and the renormalized coupling, \u03bbr providing the correct 4-point function at zero momenta, the counters terms Z\u221e and Z\u03bb are equal to all orders of the perturbation theory. Moreover,\nZ\u22121\u221e := 1 \u2212 2\u03bbrA\u221e (3.32)\nwith A\u221e given by\nA\u221e := \u2211\np\u2208S\u039b\u2282Z4\n( 1\nZ\u221ep2 + Zmm2r \u2212 \u03a3\u221e(p)\n)2 , (3.33)\n5Note that to agree with the convention in the literature and in appendix A.1, we canceled the global factor 2 by a suitable redefinition of fields and couplings in this section.\n6Avoiding IR fixed-points, see [97] for more details.\nwhere the sum is assumed to have some UV cut-off \u039b (lim\u039b\u2192\u221e S\u039b = Z4) and \u03a3\u221e(p) has quartic and logarithmic divergences with respect to \u039b.\nThe counter-terms in (3.33) cancels all the divergences in \u03a3\u221e(p), except the global one of the sum, which corresponds to the last subtraction in the Zimmerman forest. Hence, A\u221e behaves as ln(\u039b). More details can be found in appendix A.1."

An analogous notion can be defined for TGFTs (see the references [59, 97], or [61]), which accommodates the non-local nature of the interactions and the background independent definition of the theory. We have the following definition:\nDefinition 4 Let b a bubble having n(b) white vertices and G the set of 2-points diagrams made of a single vertex of type b. The scaling dimension dim(b) is defined as:\ndim(b) = 2 \u2212 max r\u2208G \u03c9(r) . (3.34)\nThis definition in particular implies that 2-points bubbles have dimension 2, and in particular, the mass must have dimension 2: [m2] = 2. In the same way, from (2.23), the leading order 2-point functions build with a single quartic melonic vertex are such that \u03c9(r) = 2, and the canonical dimension vanish [\u03bb] = 0, in agreement with the just-renormalizability of the quartic model."

Usually, these approximations take the form of truncation in the full theory space, which is the functional space of infinite dimension spanned by all allowed classical actions defined by the condition that the classical Hamiltonian H[\u03c6, \u03c6\u0304] is a sum of connected invariants. The truncation will allow for the restriction of the phase space to a smaller domain where the equations will be easily solvable. The method that we propose, the effective vertex expansion (EVE), nevertheless allows capturing entire sectors, containing an infinite number of interactions, as well as the dependence of the effective vertices on the external momenta.\nWe will choose the following ansatz for the effective average action \u0393k:\n\u0393k[M, M\u0304, \u03c3, \u03c3\u0304] = \u21262 \u2211 p\u2208Z5 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9\u0302 ( Y (k)\u03c3\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302)\u03c3p(\u03c9\u0302)\n+ i\u03c3\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302) ( \u2212iY (k)\u03c9\u0302 + Z(k)p2 + m2(k) ) Mp(\u03c9\u0302)\n+ iM\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302) ( iY (k)\u03c9\u0302 + Z(k)p2 + m2(k) ) \u03c3p(\u03c9\u0302)\n+ i (\n\u03c3\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302) \u03b4H\u0302int,k \u03b4M\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302) + \u03c3p(\u03c9\u0302) \u03b4H\u0302int,k \u03b4Mp(\u03c9\u0302)\n)) , (4.1)\nwhere Y (k) as Z(k) and m(k) look like a kinetic coupling and this parameter ensures the time reversal symmetry with respect to the transformation (3.13) and (3.14), and\nH\u0302int,k[M, M\u0304 ] = \u222b dt\u0302 \u2211\nb\nkdim(b)Zn(b)(k)\u03bb\u0304bTrb[\u03c6(t\u0302), \u03c6\u0304(t\u0302)] , (4.2)\nprovided that Hint is given by (2.12) and the dimensionless time t\u0302 is t\u0302 := \u2126t. The sum runs over connected tensorial invariants, dim(b) is the scaling dimension of the bubble b (see (3.34)) and n(b) the number of fields \u03c6(g, t) involved in the interaction b. One can justify the truncation (4.1) as follows. First, the time-reversal symmetry (3.13) implies that the quadratic term in \u03c3\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302)\u03c3p(\u03c9\u0302) renormalizes as the linear terms i\u03c9\u0302\u03c3\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302)Mp(\u03c9\u0302) and \u2212i\u03c9\u0302M\u0304p(\u03c9\u0302)\u03c3p(\u03c9\u0302).\nRemark 4 The truncation (4.1) is compatible with a symmetric phase approximation, i.e., with an expansion around zero vacuum field. In the symmetric phase, it is easy to check that 2-point functions are diagonals in their momenta indices. Moreover, odd vertex function vanishes identically \u2013 see [97] for an extended discussion.\nLet us move on to the choice of the regulator. For all our investigations we chose regulators R(1)k and R (2) k as a product of a pure frequency regulator with a momentum regulator. For the frequency regulator, we choose7:\nR (1) k (p, \u03c9) = \u2126k2Z(k)\u03c1k(\u03c9)rk(p2) , (4.3)\nand for the momentum regulator rk(p2) we choose the usual Litim regulator:\nrk(p2) := \u03b1 ( 1 \u2212 p 2\nk2\n) \u03b8(k2 \u2212 p2) . (4.4)\nFor the frequency regulator, we chose:\n\u03c1k(\u03c9) := k2\nk2 \u2212 i\u03b2\u03c9/\u2126 . (4.5)\nThis choice has been considered in [104, 105]. It is causal (with a single pole in the lower part of the complex plane), and its Fourier transform behaves like\n7Although we chose \u2126 = 1 above, we reintroduce \u2126 here to clarify the conventions.\n\u223c e\u2212k2\u2126t/\u03b2\u03b8(t). Numerical coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2 should be numerically tuned from the minimal sensitivity principle (MSP), which assumes that an optimized flow induces a minimal dependence on the choice of the regulator [101, 104, 124]. Thus, by numerically computing the critical exponents and varying the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, the MSP will fix their values at the points where the derivatives of the exponents concerning these parameters will vanish. In particular, for \u03b2 = 0, the coarse-graining is about momenta only, and we recover the standard RG without time regularization. In the rest of this paper, we will introduce dimensionless momenta x and frequencies y, defined as: p2 = k2x , \u03c9 = \u2126Z(k)k2Y \u22121(k)y . (4.6) We furthermore define the renormalized \u03b2 as:\n\u03b2 = Z\u22121(k)Y (k)\u03b2\u0302 , (4.7) such that \u03c1k(\u03c9) transforms as:\n\u03c1k(\u03c9) \u2192 \u03c1\u0302(y) = 1\n1 \u2212 i\u03b2\u0302y , (4.8)\nand: R\n(1) k (p, \u03c9) \u2192 R\u0302(1)(x, y) := Z(k)\u03c1\u0302(y)r(x) , (4.9)\nwhere r(x) := \u03b1(1 \u2212 x)\u03b8(1 \u2212 x). The equation for R(2)k can be derived from (3.21), we have:\nR (2) k (p, \u03c9) = \u21262k2 2i\u03c9 Z(k) (\u03c1k(\u2212\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c1k(\u03c9)) rk(p 2) , (4.10)\nand we get: R\n(2) k (p, \u03c9) =: \u2126Y (k)\u03c4\u0302(y)rk(p2) , (4.11)\nwhere \u03c4\u0302(y) = \u2212 \u03b2\u0302\n1 + \u03b2\u03022y2 , (4.12)\nwhich define a dimensionless function R\u0302(2)(x, y) as: R\u0302(2)(x, y) := Y (k)\u03c4\u0302(y)r(x) .

Note that the definition holds for diagrams involving square nodes.\nAnother important concept is that of the boundary diagram. It concerns Feynman diagrams, such as the one shown in the figure 2. We have the following definition:\nDefinition 7 Let G be a regular (d+1)-colored Feynman diagram with 2N external dotted edges. They are hooked to 2N black and white nodes, say externals, and the boundary diagram \u2202G of G is the regular d-colored graph, discarding edges with color 0 and such that:\n1.

Thus, all 1PI functions will be assumed to admit a Feynman series whose boundary diagrams are non-branched melons, and\nwe will index each effective vertex by a bubble of this type.

Diagrams of equation (4.32) can be easily translated in a formula, for instance (we count the diagram twice):\ni\n\u03c3\u0304p1(\u03c9\u03021) Mp2(\u03c9\u03022)\n= \u2212 2\u03b4p1p2\u03b4(\u03c9\u03021 \u2212 \u03c9\u03022) \u03c0\n(2) k (p211, p211)\n\u03c0\n\u00d7 \u2211\np\n\u03b4p1,p11 \u222b d\u03c9\u0302Gk,\u03c3\u0304M(p2, \u03c9\u0302)Gk,M\u0304M(p2, \u03c9\u0302)R\u0307 (1) k (p, \u03c9\u0302) . (4.35)\nIn that equations, the components Gk,M\u0304M and Gk,\u03c3\u0304M of the 2-point function can be computed explicitly as:\nGk,\u03c3\u0304M(p2, \u03c9\u0302) = \u2212 1 k2 i Z(k) 1 f\u0302(x, \u2212y) (4.36)\nand: Gk,M\u0304M(p2, \u03c9\u0302) =\n1 k4 Y (k) Z2(k) 1 + \u03c4\u0302(y)r(x) f\u0302(x, y)f\u0302(x, \u2212y) , (4.37)\nwhere r(x) := \u03b1(1 \u2212 x)\u03b8(1 \u2212 x), and for the truncation that we consider:\nf\u0302(x, y) = iy + x + m\u03042 + \u03c1\u0302(\u2212y)r(x) , (4.38)\nthe dimensionless and renormalized mass and vertex function m\u03042 and \u03c0\u0304(2)k being defined as (see (4.2)):\nm2 =: Z(k)k2m\u03042 , \u03c0(2)k = Z2(k)\u03c0\u0304 (2) k . (4.39)\nUsing these definitions, a straightforward calculation leads to the expression:\ni\n\u03c3\u0304p1(\u03c9\u03021) Mp2(\u03c9\u03022)\n= i\u03c0\u0304(2)k (p211, p211)\u03b4p1p2\u03b4(\u03c9\u03021 \u2212 \u03c9\u03022)Z(k)k2L21(x1) ,\nwhere x1 := p1/k and assuming k large enough sums can be replaced by integrals. Hence, we define:\nL21(x1) := 2 \u03c0 \u222b Rd dx\u2032dy\u03b4(x\u20321 \u2212 x1)\u00b51(x\u2032, y) 1 + \u03c4\u0302(y)r(x\u2032) f\u0302(x\u2032, y)f\u0302 2(x\u2032, \u2212y) , (4.40)\nhaving introduced the notation x \u2208 Rd, with components xi and square length x \u2261 \u2211 i x 2 i . In the same way, we get the second diagram:\n\u03c3\u0304p1(\u03c9\u03021) Mp2(\u03c9\u03022)\ni = i\u03c0\u0304 (2) k (p211, p211)\u03b4p1p2\u03b4(\u03c9\u03021 \u2212 \u03c9\u03022)Z(k)k2(\u2212L22(x1)) , (4.41)\nwith: L22(x1) =\n2 \u03c0 \u222b Rd dx\u2032dy\u03b4(x\u20321 \u2212 x1) \u00b52(x\u2032, y) f\u0302(x\u2032, y)f\u0302(x\u2032, \u2212y) . (4.42)\nThe flow equation for mass can be obtained by setting p1 = 0. From the normalization condition (4.26), we get:\n\u03b2m2 = \u2212(2 + \u03b7)m2 \u2212 d\u03bb\u0304 (L21(0) \u2212 L22(0)) , (4.43)\nusing the conventional notation in field theory \u03b2X := X\u0307. In the symmetric phase moreover, where in particular \u0393(3)k = 0, the anomalous dimension \u03b7Y vanishes identically, as it can be easily checked from definitions (4.18) and (4.29):\n\u03b7Y = 0 . (In the symmetric phase) (4.44)\nLet us detail the derivation of the flow equation for \u03b7. We will not be able to complete the derivation in this section, the end of the derivation being given in Section 5. From definition (4.29), we have the self-consistency equation:\n\u03b7 = \u2212\u03bb\u0304\u2032 (L21(0) \u2212 L22(0)) \u2212 \u03bb\u0304 d\ndx21 (L21(x1) \u2212 L22(x1)) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x1=0 , (4.45)\nwhere we defined, d\ndp21 \u03c0\n(2) k (p21, p21) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 p1=0 =: Z2(k)k\u22122\u03bb\u0304\u2032 . (4.46)\nThe equation for the 4-point coupling \u03bb can be deduced from the renormalization condition (4.25), setting external momenta and frequencies to zero. Deriving equation (3.4) one time for \u03c3\u0304, one time for M\u0304 and two times concerning M and setting external momenta and frequencies to zero, we get, using the same graphical representation as before:\ni\u03bb\u0307 \u03c0 \u03b4(0) = \u2212\n\u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302) M0(0\u0302) \u2212\n\u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302) M0(0\u0302)\n+ \u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302) M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302)\n+ M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302)\n\u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302)\n+ M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302)\n\u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302)\n+ \u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302)\n+ M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302)\n\u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302)\n+ \u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302) M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302)\n+ \u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302) M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302) + \u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302) M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302)\n(4.47)\nThis equation requires defining the 6-point functions, as we defined the 4-point ones (equation (4.25)). We need only the zero momenta function, which reads as follows:\n\u0393(6),(\u2113) k,\u03c3\u0304MM\u0304MM\u0304M \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 0 = 9i \u03c02 \u03ba\u03b4(\u03c9\u03021 \u2212 \u03c9\u03022 + \u03c9\u03023 \u2212 \u03c9\u03024 + \u03c9\u03025 \u2212 \u03c9\u03026) , (4.48)\nwhere \u03ba denotes the sixtic coupling constant. For the two first diagrams, we get:\n\u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302) M0(0\u0302) +\n\u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302) M0(0\u0302) = 3i2\u03c0Z 2(k)\u03ba\u0304\u03b4(0) (L21(0) \u2212 L22(0)) ,\n(4.49)\nwhere from (3.34): \u03ba =: k\u22122Z3(k)\u03ba\u0304 . (4.50)\nIndeed, the maximally divergent 2-point diagram that we can build from a melonic 6-point interaction has a divergent degree (see proposition 1):\n\u03c9(r) = \u22122L + F = \u22122 \u00d7 2 + 2 \u00d7 (d \u2212 1) = 4 , (4.51)\nthen dim(b) = \u22122. The computation of diagrams involving 4 points vertices requires being more careful. Let us compute the first one. Explicitly we have:\n\u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302) M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302)\n= \u2212\u03b4(0)4i\u03bb 2\n\u03c02\n\u00d7 \u2211\np\n\u03b4p1,p11 \u222b d\u03c9\u0302Gk,\u03c3\u0304M(p2, \u03c9\u0302)Gk,\u03c3\u0304M(p2, \u03c9\u0302)Gk,M\u0304M(p2, \u03c9\u0302)R\u0307 (1) k (p, \u03c9\u0302) , (4.52)\nwhich after some algebra can be rewritten as follows:\n\u03c3\u03040(0\u0302)\nM0(0\u0302) M0(0\u0302)\nM\u03040(0\u0302)\n= \u03b4(0)4i\u03bb\u0304 2\n\u03c02 Z2(k)L31 , (4.53)\nwith: L31 = \u222b R4 dxdy \u00b51(x, y) f 2(x, y) 1 + \u03c4(y)r(x) f(x, y)f(x, \u2212y) . (4.54)\nEach diagram can be computed in the same way. One can check for instance that the contribution of the first diagram equals one of the fifth diagrams, and after a tedious computation we get for \u03b2\u03bb := \u02d9\u0304\u03bb:\n\u03b2\u03bb = \u22122\u03b7\u03bb\u0304 \u2212 3 2 \u03ba\u0304 (L21(0) \u2212 L22(0)) + 16\u03bb\u03042 \u03c0\n( L31 +\n1 2L32 \u2212 L33\n) , (4.55)\nwhere:\nL32 := \u222b R4 dxdy\u00b51(x, y) 1 + \u03c4(y)r(x) f 2(x, y)f 2(x, \u2212y) , (4.56)\nL33 := \u222b R4 dxdy \u00b52(x, y) f 2(x, y)f(x, \u2212y) . (4.57)\nNote that to derive these equations we used the relation:\nGk,\u03c3\u0304M(\u03c9\u0302) = Gk,M\u0304\u03c3(\u2212\u03c9\u0302) .

            "text": "The flow equation (4.2.2) for the quartic coupling \u03bb involves the sixtic coupling \u03ba. Hence in principle, we are obliged to consider the flow equation for \u03ba, which involves the octic couplings and so on. The infinite hierarchical structure does not stop, even if:\n1. We stop it abruptly, imposing \u0393(2n)k = 0 up to some n (crude truncation).\n2. We are able to express \u0393(2n)k , up to a given n, in terms of \u0393 (2(n\u22121)) k , \u0393 (2(n\u22122)) k\nand so on.\nThe first option has been widely considered for TGFTs [53, 55, 56, 59, 60, 128], but some instability effects and incompatibilities with symmetry constraints have been noticed in our previous works [62, 65, 66], and the reliability of its predictions is still debated. The second option is more difficult to implement in general. It happens that we can close the hierarchy in this way by exploiting some constraints coming from the symmetries of the theory and which imply exact relations between effective vertices, such as the Ward identities (see for instance [118]). In this paper we follow the strategy developed in our previous work [97], where authors present a method exploiting the tree structure of leading order graphs, as melonic graphs, to get non-trivial relations between non-branching observable. Because melonic diagrams dominate the RG flow in the deep UV, this strategy is expected to out-perform the standard vertex expansion. Indeed, this method, called effective vertex expansion (EVE) allows closing the hierarchy and capture the full momenta dependence of effective vertices. We will now detail it here.\nIf we consider the quartic model given by (2.25), there are two kinds of quartic vertices, corresponding to vertices of type a and type a\u0304. Hence, a general Feynman graph for the model takes the form given by Figure 9 (on left), involving type a and type a\u0304 vertices. Note that we have no dotted edges liking square nodes because Gk\u03c7\u0304\u03c7 = 0. We denote as G the set of Feynman graphs corresponding to this model. We moreover define F as the surjective map F : G \u2192 G\u0304, which send any Feynman\ngraph G to a Feynman graph G\u0304 \u2208 G\u0304 of the equilibrium theory (2.14). We denote as G\u0304 the set of Feynman graphs for the equilibrium theory. To be more precise, F acts on a given graph G by replacing all square nodes with disk nodes, without changing their color. A write square becomes a white disk and a black square becomes a black disk, as illustrated on 9. Moreover, propagators (2.46) and (2.47) for the dynamical theory are replaced by the propagator (2.19) of the equilibrium theory, a rank 5 Abelian GFT for U(1) structure group. Obviously, the inverse map F\u22121 is not oneto-one in general: F\u22121(G\u0304) = (G1, G2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , GK), and we denote as K the multiplicity of the graph G\u0304. In our previous works, EVE has been considered for the field theory corresponding to the equilibrium state (2.13) in [65, 66, 97]. The authors showed that melonic non-branched 6-point function \u0393(6),(\u2113)k , corresponding to sixtic melonic boundaries with color \u2113 (accordingly with the definition (4.22)) can be expressed in terms of the 4-points and 2-points functions, and for zero external momenta (which is what we need to close the hierarchy), this relation reads:\n\u0393(6),(\u2113)k,eq \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 0 = (3!)2 \u00d7 AG\u03040 , (4.59)\nwhere (3!)2 counts the number of different configurations for external momenta and the graph G\u03040 is pictured in Figure 10. Note that G\u03040 is not truly a Feynman graph but an effective graph, where external 4 point\u2019s vertex are effective 4-points functions materialized by their boundary graphs and resuming an arbitrary number of graphs and where the interior 2-point functions have been resumed as well (see equation (2.19)):\npq = \u03b4pq p2 + m2 \u2212 \u03a3R(p) , (4.60)\nwhere p \u2208 Z5 and \u03a3R means that divergences of the self-energy have been canceled by counter-terms Z\u221e and Zm, accordingly with the renormalization condition (3.30). If we apply the inverse map F\u22121 to G\u03040 we obtain a family of graphs (G1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , GK), but having different boundaries (see definition 7). Hence, if we restrict ourselves to the graphs having the same boundary \u2202G0 of \u0393(6),(\u2113)k,\u03c3M\u0304MM\u0304MM\u0304 \u2223\u2223 0, we focus on the set S = {F\u22121[G\u03040]|\u2202Gi = \u2202G0 \u2200Gi \u2208 F\u22121[G\u03040]}, where explicitly:\n\u2202G0 := , (4.61)\nand the zero momenta effective vertex function \u0393(6),(\u2113) k,\u03c3\u0304MM\u0304MM\u0304M \u2223\u2223 0 decomposes as:\n\u0393(6),(\u2113) k,\u03c3M\u0304MM\u0304MM\u0304 \u2223\u2223 0 = 12 \u00d7 \u2211 G\u2208S AG , (4.62)\nwhere we used the same notation A to denote the amplitude of the stochastic model, where 12 = 3! \u00d7 2! counts the number of external momenta arrangements as before. It is easy to see that |S| = 2, and graphically:\n\u0393(6),(\u2113) k,\u03c3M\u0304MM\u0304MM\u0304 \u2223\u2223 0 = 12\u00d7  +  , (4.63)\ndisregarding external momenta and frequencies for simplicity. Note moreover that, as before, external 4-point vertices are effective 4-points functions materialized by their boundaries. Explicitly, we get:\n\u0393(6),(\u2113) k,\u03c3M\u0304MM\u0304MM\u0304 \u2223\u2223 0 = 12Z 3(k)k\u22122i ( \u03bb\u0304\n\u03c0\n)3 \u00d7 (AI1 + BI2) \u03b4(0) , (4.64)\nwhere A and B are numerical constants that we can determine by perturbation theory. It is easy to check that the loop integrals I1 and I2 are equals, and, using the integral approximation introduced before:\nI1 := \u222b R4 dx \u222b dy 1 + \u03c4(y)r(x) f 3(x, y)f(x, \u2212y) . (4.65)\nThe perturbation theory leads to A = B = 1, and we get from (4.48) and (4.50)\n\u03ba\u0304 = 4\u03bb\u0304 3\n3\u03c0 \u222b R4 dx \u222b dy 1 + \u03c4(y)r(x) f 3(x, y)f(x, \u2212y) . (4.66)\nWe are now in a position to derive the last piece of the puzzle, namely, the derivative of the effective vertex at zero external momenta (4.46), required to compute the anomalous dimension.\nRemark 5 It can be noticed that we used truncation to define the loop integral (4.65). The truncation is in principle expected to be valid only in a small region around k, namely on the support of R\u0307k. In [97], we showed that using truncation outside this support for divergent integral leads to dramatically wrong conclusions. In the same reference and [65], we showed that it can be a good approximation for convergent integral, and in particular that this does not introduce Ward identity violations. We use this approximation scheme to compute our convergent integrals in this paper, as I1 is.\nTo conclude, not that in our truncation, the integral in (4.65) can be computed analytically. For instance, without coarse-graining in frequency (\u03b2\u0302 = 0) and setting \u03b1 = 1, we have:\n\u03ba\u0304|\u03b2\u0302=0 = \u03c04\u03bb\u03043(m\u03042(m\u03042 + 3) + 3)\n6(1 + m\u03042)3 . (4.67)\nIn the opposite limit, for \u03b1 = 0 but \u03b2\u0302 = 1, we get:\n\u03ba\u0304|\u03b1=0 = \u03c04\u03bb\u03043\n6m\u03042 . (4.68)\nBoth have an obvious infrared singularity for m\u03042 = 0. Finally, for \u03b1 = \u03b2\u0302 = 1, we get:\n\u03ba\u0304|\u03b1=1,\u03b2\u0302=1 = \u03c04\u03bb3 6(1 + m\u03042)3 ( m\u03042(m\u03042 + 7) + 2(m\u03042 + 1)(2m\u03042 + 3) log(1 + m\u03042)\n\u2212 2(1 + m\u03042)(2m\u03042 + 3) log(2 + m\u03042) + 7 )\n(4.69)"

We furthermore define the operator \u03f5\u0302i, acting on the i\u2013th component of fields as:\n\u03f5\u0302i[T ]p := \u2211\nqi\n\u03f5piqiTq \u2223\u2223 qj=pj ,j \u0338=i . (5.5)\nThe global reparametrization invariance of the path integral defining the generating functional Z[J, J\u0304 , \u0237, \u0237\u0304 ] means that:\n\u03f5\u0302i[Z[J, J\u0304 , \u0237, \u0237\u0304 ]] = 0 , (5.6)\nfor all i \u2208 J1, d K. We can expand this relation to first order in \u03f5:\n0 \u2261 \u222b\ndqd\u03c7 [\u03f5\u0302i[S[q, \u03c7]] + \u03f5\u0302i[\u2206Sk[q, \u03c7]] \u2212 \u03f5\u0302i[J \u00b7 q + \u0237 \u00b7 \u03c7]] e\u2212S[q,\u03c7]\u2212\u2206Sk[q,\u03c7]+J \u00b7q+\u0237\u00b7\u03c7 . (5.7)\nWe will compute each term of the variation separately, starting with the source terms:\nComputation of \u03f5\u0302i[J \u00b7 q + \u0237 \u00b7 \u03c7]. The operator \u03f5\u0302i acts linearly on each field, and after some arrangements we get:\n\u03f5\u0302i[J \u00b7 q + \u0237 \u00b7 \u03c7] = \u222b d\u03c9 \u2211 p,p\u2032 \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4pjp\u2032j [J\u0304p(\u03c9)Tp\u2032(\u03c9) \u2212 T\u0304p(\u03c9)Jp\u2032(\u03c9)\n+ \u0237\u0304p(\u03c9)\u03c7p\u2032(\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c7\u0304p(\u03c9)\u0237p\u2032(\u03c9)]\u03f5pip\u2032i . (5.8)\nComputation of \u03f5\u0302i[S[q, \u03c7]]. The variation splits in two contributions, for kinetic part and interactions:\n\u03f5\u0302i[S[q, \u03c7]] = \u03f5\u0302i[Skin[q, \u03c7]] + \u03f5\u0302i[Sint[q, \u03c7]] . (5.9)\nThe second contribution to interaction vanishes by construction. The kinetic action for the response field \u2211 p \u03c7\u0304p\u03c7p is invariant as well, and the corresponding variation\nvanish. This is also the case for contributions like \u03c9\u0302 \u2211 p T\u0304p\u03c7p and m2 \u2211\np T\u0304p\u03c7p. Finally, only the Laplacian contributes non-trivially to the variation, and we get:\n\u03f5\u0302i[S[q, \u03c7]] = iZ\u221e \u222b d\u03c9 \u2211 p,p\u2032 \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4pjp\u2032j [ p2i \u2212 p\u20322i ] (\u03c7\u0304p(\u03c9)Tp\u2032(\u03c9) + T\u0304p(\u03c9)\u03c7p\u2032(\u03c9))\u03f5pip\u2032i .\n(5.10)\nComputation of \u03f5\u0302i[\u2206Sk[q, \u03c7]]. The computation of the variation of the regulator follows the same strategy as for the kinetic action:\n\u03f5\u0302i[\u2206Sk[q, \u03c7]] = \u222b d\u03c9 \u2211 p,p\u2032 \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4pjp\u2032j ( i[R(1)k (p, \u03c9) \u2212 R (1) k (p\u2032, \u03c9)]\u03c7\u0304p(\u03c9)Tp\u2032(\u03c9)\n+ i[R(1)k (p, \u2212\u03c9) \u2212 R (1) k (p\u2032, \u2212\u03c9)]T\u0304p(\u03c9)\u03c7p\u2032(\u03c9)\n+ [R(2)k (p, \u03c9) \u2212 R (2) k (p\u2032, \u03c9)]\u03c7\u0304p(\u03c9)\u03c7p\u2032(\u03c9) ) \u03f5pip\u2032i . (5.11)\nTaking into account all these contributions, the variation (5.7) implies the relation:\n0 = \u222b d\u03c9 \u2211 p,p\u2032 \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4pjp\u2032j [( iZ\u221e [ p2i \u2212 p\u20322i ] + i[R(1)k (p, \u03c9) \u2212 R (1) k (p\u2032, \u03c9)] ) \u00d7 \u2202\n\u2202\u0237p(\u03c9) \u2202 \u2202J\u0304p\u2032(\u03c9) + ( iZ\u221e [ p2i \u2212 p\u20322i ] + i[R(1)k (p, \u2212\u03c9) \u2212 R (1) k (p\u2032, \u2212\u03c9)] ) \u00d7 \u2202\n\u2202\u0237\u0304p\u2032(\u03c9) \u2202 \u2202Jp(\u03c9) + [R(2)k (p, \u03c9) \u2212 R (2) k (p\u2032, \u03c9)] \u2202 \u2202\u0237p(\u03c9) \u2202 \u2202\u0237\u0304p\u2032(\u03c9)\n\u2212 ( J\u0304p(\u03c9) \u2202\n\u2202J\u0304p\u2032(\u03c9) \u2212 Jp\u2032(\u03c9)\n\u2202\n\u2202Jp(\u03c9) + \u0237\u0304p(\u03c9)\n\u2202\n\u2202\u0237\u0304p\u2032(\u03c9) \u2212 \u0237p\u2032(\u03c9)\n\u2202\n\u2202\u0237p(\u03c9)\n)] eWk[J,J\u0304,\u0237,\u0237\u0304 ] ,\n(5.12)\nwhere we introduced the free energy:\nWk[J, J\u0304 , \u0237, \u0237\u0304 ] := ln Zk[J, J\u0304 , \u0237, \u0237\u0304 ] .

We furthermore introduce the following notations for classical fields:\nMp := \u2202Wk\n\u2202J\u0304p , M\u0304p := \u2202Wk \u2202Jp , \u03c3p := \u2202Wk \u2202\u0237\u0304p , \u03c3\u0304p := \u2202Wk \u2202\u0237p . (5.15)\nThe equation (5.16) then simplifies, and we deduce the following statement:\nProposition 3 Observable of the equilibrium dynamical model satisfy the following Ward-Takahashi identity:\n0 = \u222b d\u03c9 \u2211 p,p\u2032 \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4pjp\u2032j [( iZ\u221e [ p2i \u2212 p\u20322i ] + i[R(1)k (p, \u03c9) \u2212 R (1) k (p\u2032, \u03c9)] ) \u00d7 (\nG (1;1\u0304) k,\u03c3\u0304M(p\u2032, \u03c9; p, \u03c9) + \u03c3\u0304p(\u03c9)Mp\u2032(\u03c9) ) + ( iZ\u221e [ p2i \u2212 p\u20322i ] + i[R(1)k (p, \u2212\u03c9) \u2212 R (1) k (p\u2032, \u2212\u03c9)]\n) \u00d7 (\nG (1\u0304;1) k,M\u0304\u03c3 (p, \u03c9; p\u2032, \u03c9) + \u03c3p\u2032(\u03c9)M\u0304p(\u03c9) )\n+ [R(2)k (p, \u03c9) \u2212 R (2) k (p\u2032, \u03c9)]\n( G\n(0;1+1\u0304) k,\u03c3\u0304\u03c3 (p\u2032, \u03c9; p, \u03c9) + \u03c3p\u2032(\u03c9)\u03c3\u0304p(\u03c9) ) \u2212 J\u0304p(\u03c9)Mp\u2032(\u03c9) + Jp\u2032(\u03c9)M\u0304p(\u03c9) \u2212 \u0237\u0304p(\u03c9)\u03c3p\u2032(\u03c9) + \u0237p\u2032(\u03c9)\u03c3\u0304p(\u03c9) ] \u03b4pip\u03b4p\u2032ip\u2032 . (5.16)\nWe will exploit these identities in the melonic approximation, focusing on the nonbranching sector of the theory, to compute \u03bb\u2032. A technical complement is given in Appendix C.\n5.2 Computation of \u03bb\u2032 defined in (4.46) We now move to the last Ward identity that we need to achieve our RG program. Applying the fourth derivative \u22024/\u2202Mq(\u03c91)\u2202\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041)\u2202Mq\u2032(\u03c9\u20321)\u2202M\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304\u20321). As the previous Ward identities provided a relation between the difference of 2-points functions at different momenta and the 4-point function, the Ward identities that we will derive in this section will provide non-trivial relations between 4, 6 points functions, and the difference between 4-point kernels \u03c0(2)k (p21, p22) with different momenta. As for previous relations, we have to note that Ward identities enjoy the same structure as flow equations considered in the previous section, and indeed play a symmetric role: Ward identities say how we escape to the purely local sector, i.e. how to move inside the theory space as momentum change, and RG equations say how the theory move as the cut-off change. Obviously, the Ward generators do not commute with the flow, because flow equations describe the flow of derivative coupling as well (as the anomalous dimension for instance).\nUsing the same graphical representation as before, we obtain the equality:\n\u2212\n\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041)Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1) Mq(\u03c91)\n\u2206k\n\u2212\n\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041)Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1) Mq(\u03c91)\n\u2206k\n\u2212\n\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041)Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1) Mq(\u03c91)\n\u03b4k\n+ \u2206k\n\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1)Mq(\u03c91) + \u2206k\n\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1)Mq(\u03c91)\n+ \u2206k \u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1) Mq(\u03c91)\n+ \u2206k \u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1) Mq(\u03c91)\n+ \u2206k \u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1) Mq(\u03c91)\n+ \u2206k\n\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1)Mq(\u03c91)\n+ \u03b4k\n\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1)Mq(\u03c91) + \u03b4k \u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041)Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1) Mq(\u03c91)\n\u2212  \u03c3\u0304p\u2032(\u03c9\u03041)\nMq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)M\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1)\nMq(\u03c91)\n+\n\u03c3\u0304p\u2032(\u03c9\u03041)Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1) Mq(\u03c91)\n \u03b4pq\u0304 + \n\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041)\nMq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)M\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1)\nMp(\u03c91)\n+\n\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041)Mq\u2032(\u03c9 \u2032 1)\nM\u0304q\u0304\u2032(\u03c9\u0304 \u2032 1) Mp(\u03c91)  \u03b4p\u2032q = 0 (5.17)\nwhere permutations of external fields Mq\u2032(\u03c9\u20321) and Mq(\u03c91) are assumed when they are required. Moreover, we assumed p\u2032 \u0338= q\u2032 to cancel the last term involving two 4-point diagrams, proportional to \u03b4p\u2032q\u2032 . This relation can be translated as a differential equation for \u03c0(2)k as follows. We set pj = p\u2032j = qj = q\u0304j = 0 \u2200j \u0338= i, pi = p\u2032i +1, q\u2032 = q\u0304\u2032 = 0, pi = q\u0304i and p\u2032i = qi. With this configuration for the external momenta, the two last parentheses involve the difference:\n\u03c0 (2) k (0, p2i ) \u2212 \u03c0 (2) k (0, (p\u2032i)2) = \u03c0 (2) k (0, p2i ) \u2212 \u03c0 (2) k (0, (pi \u2212 1)2) , (5.18)\nwhich can be approached in the deep UV regime (\u039b \u226b 1) by a derivative (see the discussion before equation (C.20) in Appendix C).

(5.28)\nThe previous expression can be simplified again. Indeed, as discussed in the appendix C, equation (C.25) allows to replace L\u0304k,1 by L\u0304k,1 \u2248 \u2212\u03c0/2\u03bb\u0304. Moreover, repeating the argument given in our previous work [97], the sums involved in L\u0304(1)k,2 and L\u0304(2)k,2 being superficially convergent, the terms involving Z\u221e has to be canceled in the continuum limit. Indeed, because we focus on the UV regime but so far to the IR scale, Z\u221e/Z(k) \u2192 0 as 1/ ln(\u039b). Finally, using (4.66):\n\u03bb\u0304\u2032 = 2\u03bb\u0304 2\n3 \u222b R4 dx \u222b dy 1 + \u03c4(y)r(x) f 3(x, y)f(x, \u2212y) + 8\u03bb\u0304 2 ( L\u0304(1)k,2|Z\u221e=0 + L\u0304 (2) k,2|Z\u221e=0 ) . (5.29)\nWe have then computed the last piece of the flow equation for the anomalous dimension, equation (4.45), and we move on to the numerical investigations."

First of all, are interested to look for fixed point solutions and their vicinity. The Gaussian point \u03bb\u0304 = m\u03042 = 0 is a fixed point, and the \u03b2 functions read, at first orders:\n\u03b2\u03bb = a0(\u03b1)\u03bb\u03042 + O(m\u03042\u03bb\u03042) , \u03b2m = \u22122m\u03042 + b0(\u03b1)\u03bb\u0304 + O(m\u03042\u03bb\u03042) . (6.1)\nIt can be checked for a reasonable range of values for \u03b1 that a0(\u03b1) > 0, meaning that the theory is not asymptotically free. In other words, the theory is not perturbative in the deep UV regime: The coupling constant grows toward UV scales. This contrast with the standard result about the perturbative regime of the field theory defined by the equilibrium state (2.13), which is asymptotically free (a0 < 0), see [65] and Appendix A.2. For \u03b1 = 1, we have for instance:\na0(1) \u2248 32.90 , b0(1) = \u221216.45 . (6.2)\nNote that b0(1) = \u2212a0(1)/2 is true only for \u03b1 = 1. The fact that b0 is negative suggests the existence of a large river or \"mainstream\u201d effect, dragging the flow. This\n8An extended discussion about the physical meaning of such a procedure in that context is given in the conclusion.\nis illustrated on Figure 11 for \u03b1 = 1 (on left) and for \u03b1 = 4 (on right), the blue region on the figures corresponding to the phase space domain where the denominator of \u03b7 is negative. Note that the existence of the fixed point and its properties are highly sensitive to the choice for \u03b1 as soon as \u03b1 \u2272 3. Furthermore, for some small values for \u03b1, the anomalous dimension \u03b7 at the fixed point is below the regulator bounds: \u03b7 > \u03b7c = \u22122, see Figure 12. Then at the boundary, the denominator\nvanishes and the flow is ill-defined. This singularity moreover is expected to be a pathology of the symmetric phase expansion (i.e. expansion around zero vacuum), and only the region where the denominator is positive, connected with the Gaussian fixed point \u03bb\u0304 = m\u03042 = 0 is physical. In both cases, we show the existence of a purely attractive UV fixed point, with complex critical exponents \u03b8, \u03b8 = \u03b81 \u00b1 i\u03b82, \u03b81 > 09. Trajectories are then separated by the critical line joining the interacting fixed point and the Gaussian fixed point. Some trajectories come from positive mass (red curve for example) and someone\u2019s come from negative mass (green curve). This is reminiscent of the physics of second-order phase transition, controlled by a nontrivial fixed point [37] in the deep IR. The parametrization for the regulator reveals a strong dependency for \u03b1 \u2272 3, but increasing \u03b1 reveals a region where stability is improved. Because the theory is not asymptotically free, the existence of this fixed point ensures the safety of the theory in the deep UV. For \u03b1 = 4, we get:\n\u03b8 = 1.57 \u00b1 4.11i (6.3)\nand for the anomalous dimension \u03b7 \u2248 1.06. Figures 12 and 13 show the dependency on \u03b1 of critical exponent and anomalous dimension at the fixed point. Figure 12\n9We define the critical exponent as the opposite of the eigenvalues of the stability matrix M with entries Mij := \u2202i\u03b2j , i.e. with the opposite sign regarding the ordinary definition.\nshows that the real part \u03b81 = \u211c(\u03b8) depends weakly on the parameter \u03b1 as soon as \u03b1 > 3. Furthermore, the imaginary part \u03b82 = \u2111(\u03b8) has some stationary points, for \u03b1 \u2248 3.7, 4.3 and 5.9. These points, on the other hand, correspond to nothing from the point of view of the anomalous dimension, which shows no stationary points. For, \u03b1 > 6.4 however, \u03b82 is almost stationary. In this range of values moreover, the anomalous dimension remains small enough, what is expected to be a good indicator for the convergence of the derivative expansion [129] , even if the resulting value for \u03b7 is large regarding the values considered in the literature, for the Ising model for instance. 10 Figure 14 shows the behavior of the flow for \u03b1 = 7, the arrow being oriented toward IR scales. The anomalous dimension has value \u03b7\u2217 = 0.4, and the critical exponents are:\n\u03b8\u2217 = 1.28 \u00b1 1.98i . (6.4)\n10A relation between the convergence of the derivative expansion and the minimal sensitivity to the choice of the regulator is stressed in [124]."

Once again, we confirm the existence of a UV attractor separating the phase space into two regions, an ergodic phase with positive mass, and an expected non-ergodic phase, with negative mass in the IR. The fact that this transition is controlled by an interactive fixed point makes this phase transition a second-order transition [130]. If the \u03b2 parameter seems to aggravate the dependence on the regulator of the results for a large range of values, and to reduce considerably the portion of the phase space connected to the Gaussian point\u2013it appears that in a regime where \u03b2\u0302 is small enough, \u03b2\u0302 < 0.5, a valley of stability exists for the critical exponents and the anomalous dimension, contrary to what it was for the \u03b2\u0302 = 0 case.\nThese conclusions are summarized in Figures 15 and 16. These figures represent the dependence of the anomalous dimension and the critical exponents on the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2\u0302. We notice the existence of a global minimum sensitivity point for \u03b2\u0302 \u2248 0.28 and \u03b1 \u2248 3.2, where the sensitivity of the regulator is minimal.

Because we were able to find a global stability point for critical exponents and anomalous dimensions, we expect the result of this section more reliable than the result of the previous one, but in absence of additional theoretical expectations, we cannot conclude about the absolute reliability of a method with respect to the other one."

            "text": "In this paper, we introduced the basics of a stochastic formalism for GFTs in equilibrium dynamics. In that regime, we were able to construct a nonperturbative RG formalism that takes into account time-reversal symmetry and causality of solutions of the stochastic equation (2.4). We focused on a model which describes an Abelian stochastic complex field with rank 5 and group structure U(1), whose equilibrium state is a just-renormalizable GFT for a pure gravity model. For this model, restricting ourselves to the melonic non-branching sector of the theory in the symmetric phase, we were able to construct an exact RG solution of the flow equation, closing the infinite hierarchy of the equation around just-renormalizable interactions. This strategy, mixing melonic equations and WT identities allows expressing vertex functions \u0393(2n)k for n \u2265 3 in terms of \u0393 (4) k and \u0393 (2) k , keeping by this way the full momenta dependence of the vertex, and to compute the derivative of the vertex for an external moment that plays an important role in the derivation of the anomalous dimension. Hence, the resulting equations describe the full non-branching sector and can be easily investigated numerically.\nOur numerical investigations have revealed the existence of a non-trivial fixed\npoint, possessing the characteristics of an ultraviolet attractor, in a physically relevant regime where the dependence on the parameters defining the controller is minimal. The choice of this parameterization considerably restricts the space of physical controllers, and this optimization would deserve to be further investigated. On this point, our results also show that coarse-graining in both frequency and momentum (i.e. using the degrees of freedom of the background scalar field as an external notion of scale) seems to improve the stability (and thus the reliability) of the results. Thus, we predict the existence of a second-order phase transition associated with an ergodicity break in the IR, controlled by a non-trivial UV fixed point. The scenario is reminiscent of the asymptotic safety scenario encountered for instance for f(R)-gravity models [130\u2013133], and provide a strong evidence in favor of UV completion of our model [37]. Note that our construction focus on the deep UV regime and UV completion issue, and due to the compactness of the structure group U(1) \u223c S1, symmetry restoration is expected in the deep IR due to the survival of zero modes. A way to solve this limitation should be to construct a kind of thermodynamic limit, sending the radius of the compact space S1 to infinity, or to consider non compact group, see for instance [30, 56, 134\u2013136] and references therein. Finally, the reader could be confused about the fact that the continuum limits \u039b \u2192 \u221e seem to be in contradiction with the observation that the theory is not asymptotically free, and three remarks about these observations are in order. 1) The flow equations receive contributions only for a small window of momenta around the IR cut-off k, and the Wetterich equation is then well-defined in the limit k \u226a \u039b. 2) The counter-terms for the theory are designed such that the equilibrium distribution, which defines an asymptotically free theory (see Appendix A.2), is perturbatively renormalizable. 3) Despite the fact that the out-of-equilibrium theory is not asymptotically free, it seems to be protected from Landau Pole and triviality by the existence of a UV attractive fixed point for the complete cyclic melonic sector. This fixed point is reminiscent of an asymptotic safety scenario ensuring UV completeness of the theory, and one expects that it guarantees that the theory is consistent for all momenta scales (it is at least a necessary condition, see for instance [37].\nAlthough we focused on a toy model, disregarding some physical inputs in TGFTs, especially following the group structure which is not Abelian for realistic quantum gravity models, and in regard to some gauge symmetry like Gauss or Plebanski constraints, we expect that the general framework detailed in this paper could be suitable to investigate stochastic aspects of the best candidates for quantum gravity. Finally, even if the \u201ctime\" has been interpreted as a relational time, as the configurations of some matter fields, other matter fields could be added to the group fields, such that equilibrium states describe quantum gravity interacting with matter rather than a pure gravity regime. Another way of investigation concerns another current discrete approach to quantum gravity. For instance RTM. One can imagine a RTM described a dynamical tensorial variable Ti1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,id(t), by the same kind of equation like (2.4). Such an equation will describe a stochastic tensor, and one may imagine many ways to approach its dynamics. A renormalization group\nstudy, similar to what we did in this paper, is for instance expected, with the difference that RTM does not enjoy an intrinsic scaling law as for TGFTs. Hence, more sophisticated approaches are required to construct reliable truncations, which we will discuss in a forthcoming work.\nAcknowledgements: The authors thank the anonymous referee for his comments which contributed to improve the presentation of this paper.\nAdditional material"

            "text": "In this section, we review shortly the main results about RG for the equilibrium state (2.13), which describes a pure gravity TGFT, for a complex group field with rank d. We focus on d = 5, for an Abelian model with group structure U(1) and quartic melonic interactions (2.25). This model has been largely investigated in the literature, see [65, 97, 99, 114, 137] and references therein. In this section we sketch the main lines of the reference [65] that the reader may consult for more details. In the section A.1 we provide a derivation of the relation between counter-terms for the wave function and coupling and a formal expression for them. Note that for this derivation we make use of the standard Schwinger-Dyson equation, considered in full detail in [126, 127], in contrast with the discussion given in [65] based on the existence of a finite radius of convergence for the renormalized series (see also [100]). Note that in this section we define equilibrium state as \u03c1 \u223c e\u2212H, without the factor 2 that can be canceled by a global redefinition of fields.\nA.1 Melonic Schwinger-Dyson equation and counter-terms Schwinger-Dyson equations in quantum field theory are relations between observable, generally taking the form of self-consistency equations for 1PI functions. For the TFGT that we considered in this paper, two of them are especially relevant in the melonic sector, for 2 and 4-point functions, and have the structure pictured in Figure 18 (see [127] for more details). Note that we focus on 2 and 4 point functions because the quartic model is just-renormalizable, and both these relations are sufficient to constrain the counter-terms.\nNote that, in the second figure, we assumed that the 1PI 4-point function has the connected quartic melonic for boundary and \u03c0(\u2113)melo is defined by:\n\u0393(4),(\u2113) M\u0304MM\u0304M = 2\u03c0(\u2113)melo(p21\u2113, p23\u2113) ( W(\u2113)p1,p2,p3,p4 + p2 \u2194 p4 ) . (A.1)\nMoreover \u03a3melo designates the self energy, related to the full 2-point function Gmelo and the bare propagator C by the Dyson equation:\nGmelo = 1\nC\u22121 \u2212 \u03a3melo , (A.2)\nwhere following the definitions of section 3.3.1,\nC\u22121(p) = Z\u2212\u221ep2 + m2 . (A.3)\nTranslated in equations, the first closed relations pictured in Figure 18 reads:\n\u03a3melo(p) = \u22122Z\u03bb\u03bbr d\u2211\n\u2113=1 \u2211 q\u2208Zd \u03b4p\u2113q\u2113 1 Z\u221eq2 + m2 \u2212 \u03a3melo(q) . (A.4)\nThis relation means that \u03a3melo(p) =: \u2211 \u2113 \u03c3(p2\u2113), with:\n\u03c3(p2) = \u22122Z\u03bb\u03bbr \u2211 q\u2208Zd \u03b4pq1 1 Z\u221eq2 + m2 \u2212 \u03a3melo(q) . (A.5)\nAccordingly with the renormalization condition (3.30), Zinfty and Zm are such that (see [97] and references therein):\nZ\u221e \u2212 \u03c3\u2032(0) = 1 , Zmm2r \u2212 d \u00d7 \u03c3(0) = m2r . (A.6)\nHence: 1\nZ\u221eq2 + m2 \u2212 \u03a3melo(q) = 1 q2 + m2r + \u2211d \u2113=1 \u03c3r(q2\u2113 ) , (A.7)\nwhere \u03c3r(q2\u2113 ) = O(q4\u2113 ), with zero and first derivative equal to zero. Differentiating relation (A.5) with respect to p2, and setting p = 0, we get:\n\u2212\u03c3\u2032(0) \u2261 1 \u2212 Z\u221e = \u22122Z\u03bb\u03bbrA\u221e , (A.8)\nwhere A\u221e has been defined in (3.33). Now, let us consider the second relation, pictured in Figure 18. In the equation this relation reads, setting all the external momenta to zero:\n4\u03c0(\u2113)melo(0, 0) = 4Z\u03bb\u03bbr \u2212 8Z\u03bb\u03bbr\u03c0 (\u2113) melo(0, 0)A\u221e . (A.9)\nIf we use the standard renormalization condition (see [37, 123]):\n\u03c0 (\u2113) melo(0, 0) =: \u03bbr , (A.10)\nthe previous relation simplifies as:\nZ\u22121\u03bb = 1 \u2212 2\u03bbrA\u221e . (A.11)\nMoreover, from (A.8), Z\u22121\u03bb \u2212\nZ\u221e Z\u03bb = \u22122Z\u03bb\u03bbrA\u221e , (A.12)\nand using (A.11), we obtain finally:\nZ\u221e = Z\u03bb . (A.13)\nA.2 Nonperturbative RG in the non-branching sector In this section, we summarize some aspects of the nonperturbative RG in the symmetric phase for the melonic non-branching sector using EVE. All details can be found in [65], as recalled at the beginning of this section. The derivation of the equation follows essentially the same strategy as explained in section 4.2.2. Hence, in the deep UV regime 1 \u226a k \u226a \u039b, and using the Litim regulator:\nrk(p) = Z(k)(k2 \u2212 p2)\u03b8(k2 \u2212 p2) , (A.14)\nthe resulting \u03b2-functions read: \u03b2m = \u2212(2 + \u03b7)m\u0304 2 \u2212 10\u03bb\u0304 \u03c02(1+m\u03042)2 ( 1 + \u03b76 ) ,\n\u03b2\u03bb = \u22122\u03b7\u03bb\u0304 + 4\u03bb\u03042 \u03c0 2 (1+m\u03042)3 ( 1 + \u03b76 ) [ 1 \u2212 6\u03c02\u03bb\u0304 ( 1 (1+m\u03042)2 + ( 1 + 11+m\u03042 )) ] ,\n(A.15)\nwhere the anomalous dimension \u03b7 is given by:\n\u03b7 = 4\u03bb\u0304\u03c02 (1 + m\u0304 2)2 \u2212 \u03bb\u0304\u03c02(2 + m\u03042)\n(1 + m\u03042)2\u2126(\u03bb\u0304, m\u03042) + 2 (2+m\u03042)3 \u03bb\u03042\u03c04 (A.16)\nand \u2126(m\u03042, \u03bb\u0304) := (m\u03042 + 1)2 \u2212 \u03c02\u03bb\u0304 . (A.17)\nTo obtain these equations, we closed the hierarchy using the same method as discussed in the section 4.2.3, by expressing \u0393(6)k in the expression of \u03b2\u03bb in terms of \u03bb\u0304 and m\u03042. Moreover, we used the Ward identities to compute the derivative of the 4-point vertex \u0393(4)k with respect to external momenta, which plays a role in the computation of the anomalous dimension \u03b7. This additional contribution, of order \u03bb\u03042 is not a small correction for a pure local potential approximation disregarding such a contribution. Indeed, taking into account this term push forward the singularity of the denominator of \u03b7 down the singularity m\u03042 = \u22121, coming from our restriction to the symmetric phase, and thus maximally extends the investigated portion of the full phase space. In the computation of loops involved both in the expression for \u0393(6)k and the derivative of \u0393 (4) k , we used the derivative expansion for 2-point function,\nthe same approximation used for the computation of flow equations. In [65] and reference therein, it has been pointed out that such an approximation makes sense for the computation of superficially convergent integrals, and remains in agreement with Ward identities. Hence, the RG flow described by equations (A.15) satisfies the Ward identities. Moreover, the computer program Mathematica is not able to find any physically relevant fixed point for that system, and the Gaussian fixed point is the only UV-relevant fixed point, at least in this regime.\nThe quartic model (considered as an initial condition for the RG flow) is endowed with an additional amazing specificity. Indeed, the Ward identities impose a constraint between 4 and 2-point functions that can be translated locally along the RG flow as a non-trivial relation between \u03b2-functions for relevant couplings:\n\u03b2\u03bb + \u03b7\u03bb\u0304 \u2126(m\u03042, \u03bb\u0304) (1 + m\u03042)2 \u2212 2\u03c02\u03bb\u03042 (1 + m\u03042)3 \u03b2m = 0 . (A.18)\nThe flow equation for m\u03042 given by (A.15) is exact in the melonic sector, as we restrict ourselves to the connected interactions. Hence, equation (A.18) defines the function \u03b2\u03bb. On the other hand, the flow equation for \u03bb involves \u0393(6)k . Therefore, equalizing the two expressions for \u03b2\u03bb provides a non-trivial expression for \u0393(6)k (with zero external momenta). Note that this contribution may involve in principle nonconnected contributions, but we discard them from our analysis. Hence, we can use the resulting expression for \u0393(6)k in the Ward identity expressing the derivative of 4-point functions for external momenta, as discussed in section (5.2). Finally, this expression allows computing the anomalous dimension:\n\u03b7 = 4\u03c02\u03bb\u0304\n( \u03c02\u03bb\u0304 5(1+m\u03042)3 + 1 )\n(1 + m\u03042)2 \u2212 \u21261(m\u03042, \u03bb\u0304) , (A.19)\nwhere:\n\u21261(m\u03042, \u03bb\u0304) := 6\u03c02\u03bb\u0304 5 \u2212 4\u03c04\u03bb\u03042 (1 + m\u03042)3 \u2212 12\u03c02\u03bb\u0304m\u03042 5(1 + m\u03042) \u2212 4\u03c02\u03bb\u0304 5(1 + m\u03042) . (A.20)\nThis strategy is expected to provide a non-trivial improvement for the previous system (A.15), because no additional approximations are required to compute loops involved in the structure equations, as we had to do in the section 4.2.3. But the conclusions are essentially the same: The theory is asymptotically free in the UV, and no physically relevant additional fixed point in found11. Near the Gaussian fixed point,\n\u03b7 \u2248 4\u03c02\u03bb\u0304 , \u03b2\u03bb \u2248 \u2212\u03b7\u03bb\u0304 . (A.21) 11Indeed, the constraint (A.18) imposes \u03b7 = 0 for any non-trivial fixed point. But the solution\n(A.19) shows that \u03bb\u0304 = 0 is the only non-negative solution for m\u03042 > \u22121.\nB Proof of relation (3.20) From time reversal symmetry, \u2206Sk transforms as: \u2206Sk[q, \u03c7] \u2192 \u2211 p\u2208Zd \u222b dtdt\u2032 ( \u03c7\u0304p(t)R(2)k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t)\u03c7p(t\u2032) + i\u03c7\u0304p(t)R (1) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t)Tp(t\u2032)\n+ iT\u0304p(t\u2032)R(1)k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t)\u03c7p(t) \u2212 2 \u2126 \u02d9\u0304Tp(t)R(1)k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t)Tp(t\u2032) \u2212 2\u2126 T\u0304p(t \u2032)R(1)k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t)T\u0307p(t) + 2i \u2126 R (2) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t)\n( \u02d9\u0304Tp(t)\u03c7p(t\u2032) + \u03c7\u0304p(t)T\u0307p(t\u2032)) \u2212 4\u21262 \u02d9\u0304Tp(t)R(2)k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t)T\u0307p(t\u2032) ) . (B.1)\nThen, integrating by part, we find that the invariance condition of \u2206Sk by time reversal is written, up to a total derivative:\n0 \u2261 \u2211 p\u2208Zd \u222b dtdt\u2032 ( i\u03c7\u0304p(t) ( R (1) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) \u2212 R (1) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032) + 2 \u2126R\u0307 (2) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032) ) Tp(t\u2032)\n\u2212 iT\u0304p(t\u2032) ( R (1) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) \u2212 R (1) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032) \u2212 2 \u2126R\u0307 (2) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) ) \u03c7p(t)\n\u2212 2\u2126 \u02d9\u0304Tp(t)\n( R\n(1) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) \u2212 1 \u2126R\u0307 (2) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t)\n) Tp(t\u2032)\n\u2212 2\u2126 T\u0304p(t \u2032) ( R (1) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) + 1 \u2126R\u0307 (2) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) ) T\u0307p(t) ) . (B.2)\nFinally, exploiting the fact that R(2)k is a symmetric function, the two last terms can be rewritten as follows:\n0 \u2261 \u2211 p\u2208Zd \u222b dtdt\u2032 ( i\u03c7\u0304p(t) ( R (1) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) \u2212 R (1) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032) + 2 \u2126R\u0307 (2) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032) ) Tp(t\u2032)\n\u2212 iT\u0304p(t\u2032) ( R (1) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) \u2212 R (1) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032) \u2212 2 \u2126R\u0307 (2) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) ) \u03c7p(t)\n\u2212 2\u2126 \u02d9\u0304Tp(t)\n( R\n(1) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t) \u2212 R (1) k (p, t \u2212 t\u2032) \u2212 2 \u2126R\u0307 (2) k (p, t\u2032 \u2212 t)\n) Tp(t\u2032) . (B.3)\nThese relations show that a sufficient condition to avoid breaking the time reflection symmetry along the RG flow is to impose (3.20)."

Relations between 1PI functions\ncan be obtained by taking successive derivatives for the sources, but vanishing them at the end of the computation. Alternatively, one can derive with respect to the classical fields, and this is what we do in the following sections.\nAnother proof of heteroclicity. Let us start by considering the second functional derivative on both sides of the equation (5.16) with respect to the classical fields Mp(\u03c9) and M\u0304p(\u03c9). We apply the operator \u22022/\u2202Mq(\u03c91)\u2202M\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) on equation (5.16), and because definition (3.2), we have:\n\u2202Mp(\u03c9) \u2202Jp\u2032(\u03c9\u2032) = \u2202 2Wk \u2202J\u0304p(\u03c9)\u2202Jp\u2032(\u03c9\u2032) , (C.1)\nand: \u2202\u0393k\n\u2202Mp(\u03c9) = J\u0304p(\u03c9) \u2212 iR(1)k (p, \u03c9)\u03c3\u0304p(\u03c9) , (C.2)\n\u2202\u0393k \u2202\u03c3p(\u03c9)\n= \u0237\u0304p(\u03c9) \u2212 [ \u03c3\u0304p(\u03c9)R(2)k (p, \u03c9) + iR (1) k (p, \u2212\u03c9)M\u0304p(\u03c9) ] .

The first ones, corresponding to the first, third and fifth contributions to the left-hand side of (C.14) create (d \u2212 2) or (d \u2212 1) faces, respectively for \u2113 \u0338= i and \u2113 = i.\n\u2022 For \u2113 \u0338= i the contribution vanishes, because Kronecker deltas in W(\u2113)p1,p\u03042,p3,p\u03044 impose p = p\u2032.\n\u2022 For \u2113 = i, the contribution does not vanish, and is melonic following definition 2: F = d \u2212 1 (= 4), L = V = 1 and \u03c1 = 0.\nThe second kind of diagram corresponds to the second, fourth, and sixth contributions to the right-hand side of (C.14). They create no more than 0 or 1 face, respectively, for \u2113 \u0338= i and \u2113 = i.\n\u2022 For \u2113 \u0338= i the contribution vanishes because Kronecker deltas impose p = p\u2032.\n\u2022 For \u2113 = i, the contribution does not vanish, but it is not melonic (\u03c1 = 3).\nWe restrict ourselves to the melonic sector, which, as recalled in section 2 is the most divergent one, and thus the most relevant for RG. From these observations,\nthe leading order (melonics) contribution to identities (C.14) reads as:\nM\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq(\u03c91)\ni\n\u2206k\n+ i\n\u2206k\nM\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq(\u03c91)\n+ i\n\u03b4k\nM\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq(\u03c91)\n\u2212 \u2211 p,p\u2032 \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4pjp\u2032j [ \u2202J\u0304p(\u03c91) \u2202M\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) \u03b4p\u2032q\n\u2212 \u2202Jp \u2032(\u03c9\u03041)\n\u2202Mq(\u03c91) \u03b4pq\u0304\n] \u03b4pip\u03b4p\u2032ip\u2032 = 0 (Melonic order) , (C.17)\nThere are many options to interpret this equation. We know, from condition (2.48) that the two last terms must vanish exactly. Hence, we have essentially two kinds of integrals. The two first ones contributions of the involve loop integrals\u222b\nd\u03c9 G2k,\u03c3\u0304M(\u03c9) and \u222b d\u03c9 G2 k,M\u0304\u03c3\n(\u03c9). If we assume causality, these integrals have to vanish for the same reason as we discussed in Remark 3 (equation (3.29)). Moreover, terms like \u222b d\u03c9 \u03b4R\n(1) k (\u03c9)G2k,\u03c3\u0304M(\u03c9) vanish for the same reason as the left-hand\nside of equation (3.27) vanishes. With this argument, the last integral, which reads:\u222b d\u03c9 \u03b4R\n(2) k (\u03c9)Gk,\u03c3\u0304M(\u03c9)Gk,M\u0304\u03c3(\u03c9) does not vanish, and the Ward identity imposes\n\u03d6 (2) k = 0, meaning that \u0393 (2+2\u0304,) k = 0. This is expected because of the discussion of section 3.2, where causality was assumed as well, but the fact that this condition comes from a constraint imposed by an internal symmetry is a non-trivial result. The origin of this phenomenon can be traced from the arguments discussed in [65], where authors pointed out a parallel between renormalization group equations and Ward identities. Indeed, if the flow equations dictate how the interactions change with the scale, the Ward identities dictate how the interactions deviate from ultralocality (i.e. from exact unit invariance). Thus, if in section 3.2 we were able to demonstrate the absence of response field independent interaction terms by an argument from the renormalization group, Ward\u2019s identities show that a local theory whose initial conditions correspond to the model (2.38) cannot deviate from locality by response field independent contributions.\nRelation between Z(k) and \u03bb(k). In the same vein, but applying the operator \u22022/\u2202Mq(\u03c91)\u2202\u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) on the Ward identity (5.16), we obtain a relation between \u0393(4)\nk,\u03c3M\u0304MM\u0304 and \u0393(2)k,\u03c3\u0304M . Using the same graphical representation as previously, we get\n(we introduce all the Kronecker and Dirac \u03b4 to be more clear):\n( \u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq(\u03c91) i \u2206k + i \u2206k \u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq(\u03c91) + i \u03b4k \u03c3\u0304q\u0304(\u03c9\u03041) Mq(\u03c91) ) \u03b4p\u2032qi\u03b4pq\u0304i \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4qj q\u0304j \u03b4(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c9\u03041)\n\u2212 \u2211 p,p\u2032 \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4pjp\u2032j \u2206k(p, \u03c91)\u03b4pq\u0304\u03b4qp\u2032\u03b4(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c9\u03041) + \u2211 p,p\u2032 \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4pjp\u2032j [ \u03b3 (2) k,\u03c3\u0304M(p, \u03c91) \u2212 \u03b3 (2) k,\u03c3\u0304M(p\u2032, \u03c91) ] \u00d7 \u03b4p\u2032q\u03b4pq\u0304\u03b4pip\u03b4p\u2032ip\u2032\u03b4(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c9\u03041) + \u2211 p,p\u2032 \u220f j \u0338=i \u03b4pjp\u2032j \u03b4pq\u0304\u03b4qp\u2032i\u03b4R (1) k (p, \u03c91)\u03b4(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c9\u03041) = 0 ,\n(C.18)\nwhere we dropped out the non-melonic contributions and assumed them to be in the symmetric phase, using definition (4.27). Because of the definition of \u2206k, the second and fourth contributions simplify. We set q\u22a5 = q\u2032\u22a5, p\u2032 = qi, p = q\u0304i, and p = p\u2032 + 1. In the deep UV regime, it is suitable to use a continuous approximation to compute finite differences. We introduce the nearly continuous variable x := p/\u039b, where \u039b denote some UV cut-off, such that, for any function f(p2) that can be expressed in terms of dimensionless quantities as f(p2) = \u039brf\u0303(x2), and (x\u2032 = x + 1/\u039b):\nf((p\u2032)2) \u2212 f(p2) = \u039br(f\u0303((x\u2032)2) \u2212 f\u0303(x2)) = \u039br\u22122 ( df\u0303\ndx2 + O(1/\u039b2)\n) . (C.19)\nHence, from the definition (4.29), we have:[ \u03b3\n(2) k,\u03c3\u0304M(p, 0) \u2212 \u03b3 (2) k,\u03c3\u0304M(p\u2032, 0) ]\u2223\u2223 pi=0 \u2248 iZ\u03b4p2 + O(\u03b4p2) , (C.20)\nin agreement with equation (4.29), accordingly with our choice \u2126 = 1. Finally, setting external momenta to zero, the Ward identity reads:\n\u03c3\u03040\u0304(0\u0304) M0(0)\ni\n\u2206\u2032k\n\u2212 i\n\u2206\u2032k\n\u03c3\u03040\u0304(0\u0304) M0(0)\n+ i\n\u03b4\u2032k\n\u03c3\u03040\u0304(0\u0304) M0(0)\n+ i (Z \u2212 Z\u221e) = 0 , (C.21)\nor explicitly:\n2\u03bb(k) \u03c0\n\u222b d\u03c9 \u2211 p\u2208Zd\u22121 [ 2 ( iZ\u221e + i d dp21 R (1) k (p, \u03c9) ) Gk,M\u0304M(p, \u03c9)Gk,\u03c3\u0304M(p, \u03c9)\n+ d dp21 R (2) k (p, \u03c9)Gk,M\u0304\u03c3(p, \u03c9)Gk,\u03c3\u0304M(p, \u03c9) ]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 pi=0 = \u2212 (Z \u2212 Z\u221e) . (C.22)\nThis equation can be rewritten using dimensionless quantities as follows:\n4\u03bb\u0304(k) \u03c0\n\u222b dy \u222b R4 dx [ ( 1 \u2212 Z\u0304(k)\u03b1\u03c1\u0302(y)\u03b8(1 \u2212 x) ) 1 + \u03c4\u0302(y)r(x) f\u0302(x, y)f\u0302 2(x, \u2212y)\n\u2212 12\u03b1Z\u0304(k)\u03c4\u0302(y) \u03b8(1 \u2212 x)\nf\u0302(x, y)f\u0302(x, \u2212y)\n] = 1 \u2212 Z\u0304(k) , (C.23)\nwhere: Z\u0304(k) := Z(k)\nZ\u221e . (C.24)\nNote that, in these equations, f\u0302(x, y) is not expected to be of the form given by equation (4.38), except maybe for the terms involving the regulator. Indeed, for these terms, the selected windows of momenta are the same as for the flow equations. Hence, assuming the truncation (4.38) for this contribution is not an additional assumption than assuming its validity for the computation of the flow equation themselves. Following the arguments given in [97], Z\u22121\u221e \u223c ln(\u039b), and in the continuum limit, the previous Ward identity becomes:\n4\u03bb\u0304(k) \u03c0\n\u222b dy \u222b R4 dx [ ( Z\u221eZ \u22121(k) \u2212 \u03b1\u03c1\u0302(y)\u03b8(1 \u2212 x) ) 1 + \u03c4\u0302(y)r(x) f\u0302(x, y)f\u0302 2(x, \u2212y)\n\u2212 12\u03b1\u03c4\u0302(y) \u03b8(1 \u2212 x)\nf\u0302(x, y)f\u0302(x, \u2212y)\n] \u2248 \u22121 , (C.25)"
