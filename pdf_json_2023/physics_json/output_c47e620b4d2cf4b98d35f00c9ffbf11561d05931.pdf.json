Theranostic PSMA-targeting agents are widely used in patient management and has shown improved outcomes for mCRPC patients. Earlier, we optimized a urea-based probe for radionuclide visualization of PSMAexpression in vivo using computer modeling. With the purpose to develop a targeting agent equally suitable for radionuclide imaging and therapy, the agent containing DOTA chelator was designed (BQ7876). The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that 177Lu-labeled BQ7876 possesses target binding and biodistribution properties potentially enabling its use for radiotherapy.\nMethods: BQ7876 was synthesized and labeled with Lu-177. Specificity and affinity of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 to PSMA-expressing PC3-pip cells was evaluated and its processing after binding to cells was studied. Animal studies in mice were performed to assess its biodistribution in vivo, target specificity and dosimetry. [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was simultaneously evaluated for comparison.\nResults: BQ7876 was labeled with Lu-177 with radiochemical yield >99%. Its binding to PSMAwas specific in vitro and in vivowhen tested in antigen saturation conditions as well as in PSMA-negative PC-3 tumors. The binding of [177Lu]LuBQ7876 to living cells was characterized by rapid association, while the dissociation included a rapid and a slow phase with affinities KD1 = 3.8 nM and KD2 = 25 nM. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration for natLu-BQ7876 was 59 nM that is equal to 61 nM for natLu-PSMA-617. Cellular processing of [177Lu]LuBQ7876 was accompanied by slow internalization. [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 was cleared from blood and normal tissues rapidly. Initial elevated uptake in kidneys decreased rapidly, and by 3 h post injection, the renal uptake (13 \u00b1 3%\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Oncology\nID/g) did not differ significantly from tumor uptake (9 \u00b1 3%ID/g). Tumor uptake was stable between 1 and 3 h followed by a slow decline. The highest absorbed dose was in kidneys, followed by organs and tissues in abdomen.\nDiscussion: Biodistribution studies in mice demonstrated that targeting properties of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 are not inferior to properties of [177Lu]LuPSMA-617, but do not offer any decisive advantages.\nKEYWORDS\nprostate cancer, PSMA, lutetium-177, PC3-pip cells, dosimetry"

            "text": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a severe public health problem; approximately 500.000 men are diagnosed with this disease annually (1). Despite the fact of the high level of 5-year survival for local and regional PCa (99-100%), metastasized PCa has shown as low 5-year survival as 30% (2). The most common methods used for PCa treatment include radical prostatectomy and external beam radiation therapy for local disease, while hormone therapy, androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy are used for metastasized PCa. Current medical guidelines recommend antimitotic chemotherapy with docetaxel (3). However, the overall benefit for the patient is typically poor. In most cases, development of tumor resistance causes tumor progression. Due to low survival of metastatic PCa patients, an efficient treatment of metastatic PCa is one of unmet clinical needs of modern oncology (4).\nProstate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an established therapeutic target in PCa (5). PSMA (also known as glutamate carboxypeptidase II) is a type II transmembrane protein with an Nterminal cytoplasmic tail, a helical transmembrane structure, and an extracellular C-terminus (6). PSMA has two unique enzymatic functions, including NAALADase activity (cleaving terminal glutamate from the neurodipeptide, N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate, NAAG) and folate hydrolase activity, which results in cleavage of the terminal glutamates from g-linked polyglutamates (7). PSMA is located in the cytosol in normal prostate cells but is expressed as a membrane-bound protein in PCa (8). Normally, PSMA is expressed in the prostate (secretory-acinar epithelium), kidneys (proximal tubules), nervous system glia (astrocytes and Schwann cells) and the small bowel (jejunal brush border). Its function is only well defined in the nervous system and small bowel. The reason for PSMA expression in prostate epithelium and renal proximal tubules is not determined but may be connected with folate metabolism in these tissues, i.e. potential folate reuptake in the kidneys and release of monoglutamated folates into the seminal fluid (9).\nPSMA is highly expressed in hormone-resistant and metastatic PCa (10). The level of PSMA expression rises with increasing tumor dedifferentiation in metastatic and hormone-refractory cancers (11). Increased PSMA expression in prostate cancer is associated with a higher tumor grade and a high risk of disease progression as\n02\ndefined by biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (12). Different other types of cancers also show high expression of PSMA, i.e. follicular lymphoma, multiple myeloma, papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (13).\nSeveral small molecule inhibitors of PSMA have been developed and tested in clinical studies (13). Based on the zinc-binding moieties targeting the active site of PSMA, there are three types of small molecule inhibitors: phosphorous-based, thiol-based, and urea-based. The phosphorous-based type of inhibitors were discovered first and it was found that the phosphonate core was favorable for interacting with the two zinc ions in the active domain of PSMA. The discovery of the phosphorous-based inhibitors was followed by the development of thiol-based inhibitors to reduce the high polarity of the first type. Further attempts to identify alternative zinc-binding groups led to the introduction of ureabased PSMA inhibitors first reported by the Kozikowski\u2019s group (14). Currently, urea-based PSMA-targeting agents for the diagnosis and therapy of PCa are widely used in patient management (15, 16).\nThe use of PSMA-targeted therapy using radioligands, such as [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, improved outcomes for patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCa (17, 18). Although patients with low PSMA expression are not eligible for this therapy, some patients do not respond to it and some develop resistance despite initially good response (19), [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 has demonstrated impressive results in the phase III VISION trial and has been approved by Food and Drug Administration for clinical use (20).\nEarlier, we performed an optimization of the linker connecting the PSMA-binding moiety to the chelator necessary for labeling to improve the targeting features of urea-based probes for radionuclide visualization of PSMA expression in vivo (21). For that optimization, the macrocyclic triaza chelator NOTA was selected for the coordination of radionuclides. This chelator was selected because it permits efficient labeling with a number of positron-emitting radionuclides, such as 68Ga, 18F (using AlF chemistry), 55Co, 64Cu, as well as 111In for imaging using SPECT. Our findings have demonstrated that affinity to PSMA, biodistribution profile and tumor targeting efficiency are critically\nfrontiersin.org\ndependent on the linker composition. The best variant was designated as BQ7859. 111In-labeled BQ7859 accumulated in PCa xenografts in mice in a PSMA-dependent manner and provided a high contrast imaging of PSMA expression shortly after administration. It would therefore be attractive to use BQ7859 also for radionuclide therapy. However, the NOTA chelator is suboptimal for coupling of the most commonly used therapeutic radionuclide lutetium-177 since the Lu-NOTA complex is insufficiently stable (22). On the opposite, the macrocyclic tetraaza chelator DOTA provides stable conjugation of lutetium-177 (22). In addition, DOTA is suitable for labeling with other therapeutic nuclides such as 90Y, 225Ac and 227Th. Moreover, DOTA enables sufficiently stable coupling of 68Ga, 111In and 55Co that could be useful for the development of imaging companion diagnostics.\nWith the aim to develop a targeting agent, which will be equally suitable for radionuclide therapy and radionuclide imaging, a new PSMA-targeting agent was designed and designated BQ7876 (Figure 1). This agent contains the same urea-based targeting moiety and linker system as BQ7859, but is equipped with the more versatile DOTA chelator. It has to be noted that the substitution of a radionuclide-chelator part in such small targeting agent could substantially affect the charge distribution and geometry of the probe (23). This might result in appreciable alteration of binding affinity to the molecular target, off-target interaction of the agent, and influence its biodistribution properties and tumor uptake. Thus, a full pre-clinical characterization of the novel tracer was required.\nThe aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that 177Lulabeled BQ7876 possesses target binding and biodistribution properties which potentially could enable its use for radionuclide therapy. Specificity and affinity of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 binding to PSMA-expressing PC3-pip cells were evaluated and its processing after binding to the target was studied. Animal studies in mice were\nFrontiers in Oncology 03\nperformed to assess the biodistribution in vivo, the specificity of its accumulation in PSMA-expressing tumor xenografts and dosimetry .

The radiochemical yield and purity were determined using iTLC strips eluted with 0.2 M citric acid, pH 2.0. Radio-HPLC was performed using a Hitachi Chromaster HPLC system equipped with a Luna C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 150 x 4.6 mm; Phenomenex, V\u00e6rl\u00f8se, Denmark).

The HPLC system was equipped with variable UV wavelength and radioactivity detectors.\nFor the determination of a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), PSMA-617 was labeled with indium-111. For this purpose, 2 nmol PSMA-617 were dissolved in 40 \u03bcL 0.2 M ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, and 12 \u03bcL (10 MBq) of [111In]InCl3 solution in 0.01 M HCl was added.

The PSMAtransfected and overexpressing variant of PC3 cell line, PC3-pip, was provided by Prof. M. Pomper, Department of Radiology, the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, US. PC3-pip cells were cultured in two types of RPMImedia.

The second one contained 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% of L-glutamine (5 mL) and 1% of PEST (penicillin and streptomycin 5 mL) and 10 mg/mL of pyramycin. The second media is used every second passage to maintain clone selection. All in vitro experiments were performed in triplicates. For a typical experiment, cells were seeded one day before the experiment in Petri dishes (35 mm) in the amount of 1\u00d7106 cell/dish.\n2.3.1 In vitro specificity test In vivo specificity was tested using a saturation method. Before the experiment, cells were washed with PBS solution. A set of six cell dishes with PC3-pip cells was used for each substance. Cells in control dishes were pre-incubated with unlabeled compound, BQ7876 or PSMA-617 (100 nM) for 15 min to saturate PSMA. Thereafter, the radiolabeled substance ([177Lu]Lu-BQ7876, [177Lu] Lu-PSMA-617 or [111In]In-PSMA-617) was added to all cell dishes to a concentration of 1 nM. After one-hour incubation at 37\u00b0C cells were washed with PBS solution, detached and collected.

Saturation of PSMA with a large excess of unlabeled compound causes a highly significant (p< 5 x 10-6) reduction of binding of each labeled compound to cells, which demonstrates the saturable character of their binding (Figure 3).\nfrontiersin.org"

Expectedly, there was no significant difference between uptake of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 in normal organs and tissues (Figure 8A). However, the uptake in PSMA-positive PC3-pip xenografts was 19-fold higher than in PSMA-negative PC3 xenografts (p<0.005) (Figure 8B).

Although [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 has demonstrated impressive results, the treatment has shown mainly partial responses in the Phase III VISION trial (20), and a search for more efficient targeting agents is well warranted.\nIn this project, BQ7876 demonstrated attractive features. Labeling of BQ7876 with lutetium-177 resulted in radiochemical purity over 99% (Figure 2), which makes its use for clinical trials possible without purification. Moreover, it opens the way for development of a simple two-vials kit for the labeling. Activity uptake decreased with time in all of studied organs and tissues including organs accumulating free lutetium (liver, spleen and bones (30);) that demonstrated stability of metal-DOTA complex in blood circulation. The in vitro binding of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 to PSMA-expressing PC3-pip cells was saturable, i.e. specific and approximately on the same level as the binding of [177Lu]LuPSMA-617, which is currently the gold standard in the development of PSMA-targeting therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals (Figure 3). Further in vitro studies showed that IC50 value for [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 is close to the value for [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617\nFrontiers in Oncology 08\n(Figure 4), i.e. the [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 binding strength to living PSMA-expressing PCa cells is as equally good as the binding strength of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. This is encouraging because our previous experience demonstrated that modification of the linker part might change the affinity by three orders of magnitude (21). The binding of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 to PC3-pip cells was rapid (Figures 5, 6), but LigandTracer sensorgrams showed an appreciable fraction of labeled pseudo-peptide with a rapid release. The analysis of the kinetics of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 binding to PC3-pip cells in conditions excluding internalization (room temperature) indicated the presence of two interactions, one with affinity in the low nanomolar range (KD1 = 3.8 nM) and another one with approximately a six times weaker affinity (KD2 = 25 nM). The weaker interaction was characterized by a noticeable more rapid dissociation rate (kd = 7.5\u00d710 -4 s-1) than the stronger one (kd = 5.7\u00d710-5 s-1). It has been reported that PSMA is expressed on tumor cells as a noncovalent homodimer (31). It could be speculated that binding of a ligand to one of monomeric unit results in conformational changes of this unit, which influences the conformation of the second PSMA unit. It is conceivable that\nFIGURE 7 Biodistribution of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 in female BALB/C nu/nu mice bearing PC3-pip xenografts.

It has to be noted that the affinity characterizes only a strength of binding of targeted agent to its molecular target in the equilibrium conditions. However, internalization of an agent with a residualizing label (such as 177Lu) makes its binding to malignant cells irreversible and only association rate plays a role. Therefore, we performed a direct, head-to-head, comparison of cellular processing of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. The result of such comparison shows that internalization of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 is equally slow (Figure 6). Thus, one could not expect big differences in binding of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 and [177Lu] Lu-PSMA-617 to cancer cells.\nEvaluation of the biodistribution of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 in nude mice bearing PC3-pip xenografts demonstrated an efficient targeting of PSMA-expressing tumors (Figures 7, 10), and 1 h after injection, the tumor uptake was higher than the uptake in any tissue excluding kidneys. Renal activity, however, decreased rapidly within the first hours after injection. The direct comparison demonstrated that uptake in PSMA-positive PC3-pip tumors was much higher than in PSMA-negative PC3 tumors (Figure 8B). Such difference clearly\nFrontiers in Oncology 09\ndemonstrates that uptake of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 in PC3-pip xenografts is PSMA-mediated, i.e. true targeting takes place.\nIt is essential to compare the targeting properties of [177Lu]LuBQ7876 and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. The majority of researchers use PSMA-transfected PC3-pip cells as a model for in vitro and in vivo studies on PSMA targeting. However, this cell line is quite an artificial system, and experts know that PSMA expression declines with time. Therefore, a comparison with literature data might be unreliable. For this reason, we performed the comparison head-tohead, in the same batch of mice with PC3-pip xenografts (Figures 9, 10). The tumor uptake of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA617 did not differ significantly at 3 h after injection. The only significant difference was observed between the uptakes in the liver, where uptake of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 was significantly lower. This is a positive feature of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 because lower activity uptake in normal organs reduces the dose burden to patients. One could state, that [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 is at least not inferior to [177Lu]LuPSMA-617 in animal studies. Apparently, animal models cannot reflect all aspects of the biodistribution of targeted therapeutics in humans, and a Phase I clinical trial is, therefore, necessary for the complete evaluation of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876.\nA B\nFIGURE 9 (A) Comparison of biodistribution of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in female BALB/C nu/nu mice bearing PC3-pip xenografts at 3 h p.i.

P-value in unpaired t-test for xenografts is provided, **p < 0.005.\nfrontiersin.org\nEstimation of absorbed doses in healthy organs and tissue in humans after administration of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 is provided in Table 1. The effective dose was calculated to be 0.00423 Sv/GBq, Obviously, upscaling from mice to humans is associated with multiple uncertainties (32). On the other hand, our upscaling of dosimetry of a bombesin-based imaging probe [99mTc]Tc-maSSSPEG2-RM26 (effective dose 0.00349 mSv/MBq) (33) showed to be in a reasonably good agreement with clinical data (0.0044 \u00b1 0.0006 mSv/MBq) (34). As a first approximation, we compared the upscaling to humans of absorbed doses in different organs calculated for [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 in this study and for [177Lu]LuPSMA-617 (35). Both calculation utilize the same formula for upscaling and the same software (OLINDA). The results of the\ncomparisons (Supplementary Table 2) suggest that the injection of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 would result in somewhat lower absorbed doses to normal organs compared to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. Still, both ontarget and off-target interactions of targeting agents might be different in animal models and in humans. Strictly speaking, only clinical evaluation of distribution and dosimetry of [177Lu]LuBQ7876 (and comparison with an ample information available for [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617) would show if [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 offers any advantage in clinics.\nThe results of this study suggest that [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 binds specifically to PSMA-expressing PCa cells in vitro and in vivo, and has an affinity to PSMA in a similar range as [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. Biodistribution studies in mice demonstrated that targeting\nproperties of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 are not inferior to the properties of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617."
