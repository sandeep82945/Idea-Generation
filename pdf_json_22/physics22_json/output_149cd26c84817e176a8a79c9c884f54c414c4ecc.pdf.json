    "abstractText": "The use of focused ion and focused electron beam (FIB/FEB) technology permits the fabrication of microand nanometer scale geometries. Therefore, FIB/FEB technology is a favorable technique for preparing TEM lamellae, nanocontacts, or nanowires and repairing electronic circuits. This work investigates FIB/FEB technology as a tool for nanotip fabrication and quantum mechanical tunneling applications at a low tunneling voltage. Using a gas injection system (GIS), the GaFIB and FEB technology allows both additive and subtractive fabrication of arbitrary structures. Using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), resistance measurement (RM), and scanning tunneling microscope (STM)/spectroscopy (STS) methods, the tunneling suitability of the utilized metal\u2013organic material\u2013platinum carbon (PtC) is investigated. Thus, to create electrode tips with radii down to 15 nm, a stable and reproducible process has to be developed. The metal\u2013organic microstructure analysis shows suitable FIB parameters for the tunneling effect at high aperture currents (260 pA, 30 kV). These are required to ensure the suitability of the electrodes for the tunneling effect by an increased platinum content (EDX), a low resistivity (RM), and a small band gap (STM). The STM application allows the imaging of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) layers and demonstrates the tunneling suitability of PtC electrodes based on high FIB aperture currents and a low tunneling voltage.",

            "text": "The use of the quantum mechanical tunneling effect as a transducer principle for sensor applications enables sensor signals of very high resolution [1\u201311]. Furthermore, a significant miniaturization of the sensor core area [12,13] is possible. This is due to the high sensitivity of the tunneling effect, which is a result of its exponential dependence on the tunneling current and electrode spacing. Theoretically, the tunneling current changes by an order of magnitude for a change in distance of a few \u00c5. This allows accelerometers to measure the smallest accelerations or extremely reduce the seismic mass to detect the smallest deflections. For the latter, the acceleration equivalent noise is the limit for miniaturization. Therefore, to implement the required tunneling electrodes, the fabrication of very fine electrode tips is necessary to keep attractive forces low at tunneling spacings of a few nm [13]. If the radii of the tips are too large, there is a risk of a snap-in effect when they approach each other. Additionally, the common process of etching a tungsten tip regarding the STM observation, the method on hand allows for the integration into sensors with movable parts. Thus, using a dual beam consisting of Ga-FIB and FEB in combination with a GIS is suitable for tip production. In addition to the tip radii, the electrical potential between the tunneling electrodes also significantly influences the magnitude of attractive forces.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1019. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13071019 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1019 2 of 16\nTherefore, tunneling applications with freely movable electrodes aim to achieve the lowest possible tunneling voltages [13]. Through the precursor used in this work (MeCpPtMe3 = trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)platinum(IV)), a metal\u2013organic material is formed after deposition, consisting of platinum (Pt) particles embedded in a diamond-like carbon (DLC) matrix. Moreover, it is known that the conduction mechanism of metal\u2013organic materials is based on intrinsic tunneling between the metallic grains [14\u201320]. Thus, depending on the microstructure, changes in the resistance of a nanowire can be caused and measured using small strains, as demonstrated by Schwalb et al. [21]. If tunneling is to be accomplished using an additional vacuum gap, it must be ensured that the platinum particles are located in the edge region of the electrode tips. Consequently, if the distance between the platinum particles is too large, the tunneling effect comes to a standstill. Therefore, the present study aims at investigating whether the FIB/FEB parameters influence the properties of the resulting material and whether the material is suitable for electron tunneling at small tunneling voltages regarding the material proportions, the material resistivity, and the band gap. Thus, the methods of EDX and RM are used. In addition, the PtC tips are applied to a HOPG sample in an STM. An HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy) analysis about PtC nanotips is extensively discussed elsewhere by Haub et al. [22]. The study comparing several PtC tips by FIBID and FEBID using HRTEM analysis by the authors shows significant differences in the nanostructure regarding the location, size, and distribution of the Pt particles."

            "text": "This investigation is based on the use of a metal\u2013organic precursor material, MeCpPtMe3. In the deposited metal\u2013organic composite by FEBID/FIBID, the metallic components are present in a diamond-like amorphous carbon (DLC) matrix, consisting of an sp2 (graphite) and an sp3 (diamond) bonding structure. This is shown by Matsui et al. [23], Kanda et al. [24], and Stanishevsky et al. [25] by Raman spectroscopy; by Fern\u00e1ndezPacheco et al. [16] by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); and by Frabboni et al. [26] by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The comparison of the resistance of bulk Pt and PtC has also been widely investigated and can be confirmed by previous studies [17,27\u201334]. PtC has a high material resistance because of the contamination by the high ohmic DLC. The dependencies regarding deposition parameters [17,34\u201338], temperature [29,34,39], technology (FIB/FEB) [34,37], percolation of gallium [40], or material thickness [16,29] are deeply investigated. In particular, Tao et al. [38] presented the lowest resistivity of the deposited nanowires at the highest ion current of 222 pA. The resistivity of FIBID and FEBID Pt is about one to two orders of magnitude higher for FIBID Pt and about four to five orders for FEBID Pt compared with the resistivity of bulk Pt [16,29,34,38]. Moreover Utke et al. [41] gave a comprehensive review about mechanical properties of three-dimensional nanostructures obtained by FEBID/FIBID. Depending on the used technology (FEBID: approx. 10\u2013100 GPa, and FIBID: approx. 100\u2013150 GPa), there is a wide range of measured Young\u2019s modulus based on pillar bending, pillar compression, and nanoindentation for the MeCpPtMe3 precursor. Furthermore, the hardness investigated by Reiser et al. [42] through nanoindentation (material resistance to localized plastic deformation) is dominated by the carbonaceous material with approximately 6 GPa for FEBID PtC and 9 GPa for FIBID PtC and higher than for bulk Pt. Regarding the tunneling effect, the nanostructure of the PtC composite aggravates electron tunneling because of the high ohmic parts of DLC. The tunneling effect is primarily used in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) for commercial purposes with pure metal tips with low resistance. This enables tunneling currents of up to 100 nA. However, to determine the suitability of the tunneling mechanism with PtC tips, the nanostructure has to be investigated. In order to use PtC tips for tunneling through a vacuum gap, a sufficient amount of Pt in the nanostructure is necessary to achieve a high probability of Pt particles located at the edge of the tips. Previous publications have described the conduction mechanism of metal\u2013organic or granular materials as intergrain tunneling between the metallic components [14\u201319]. For example, Samanta et al. [19] demonstrated intergrain quantum tunneling in a FIBID PtC nanowire and showed the dependence of the electrical transport properties and a pressure-induced process. Moreover Kolb et al. [20] showed the variability of the tunneling properties in FEBID-based PtC wires depending on the physisorption of polar gas molecules. In the present work, a vacuum gap is added as an additional tunneling component to show the suitability of PtC nanotips for vacuum tunneling applications at low tunneling bias."

            "text": "This study elaborates on the differences between the tips when ionic and electron currents are utilized. As shown in Figure 2a, an Omniprobe lift-out Cu (copper) grid is used to deposit several tips based on FIBID and FEBID. Unlike FEBID or helium-FIBID [43\u201347], Ga-FIB deposition cannot directly fabricate sharp tips with a thickness of a few tens of nanometers. For the EDX analysis, this is basically not of importance; however, for the later investigation by means of STM analysis, comparable geometries should be produced in order to compare the results. Thus, the preparation of the FIBID tips is based on a multistep process: First, PtC bumps are deposited with ion beam currents of 9, 46, 90, and 260 pA (Figure 2b,c). Second, the bumps are sharpened by the FIB. Third, the PtC geometries are formed into a nanotip with the smallest possible radius by a minimum ion current of 1.5 pA (Figure 2d). The accelerating voltage of the FIB is set to 30 kV. As shown in Figure 2e,f, the\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1019 4 of 16\nFEBID tips are directly deposited without further processing. The accelerating voltage of the FEB is set to 5 kV, and the selected electron beam currents are 340 pA and 2.7 nA.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 17\nin Figure 2e,f, the FEBID tips are directly deposited without further processing. The accel-\nerating voltage of the FEB is set to 5 kV, and select d electron beam currents are 340\npA and 2.7 nA.\nsuitable densities of states of the free electrons. However, the number of free electrons or\nunoccupied states is significantly lower in the case of a semiconductor or insulator. As a\nresult, higher tunneling voltages must be applied to generate a sufficient tunneling cur-\nrent. The elements in the material are determined by the EDX analysis in order to perform\nan estimation of the tunneling capability of the material. Since a metal\u2013organic material\ncomposite is deposited, the analysis of the respective atomic fractions is worthwhile in the\ncase of this study.

This varies depending on the material and is in the order of a few \u00b5m.\nFigure 3 shows the pads deposited in each case and, as an example, a detailed image in\nthe side view on the left.

In addition, a PtC pad is\ndeposited with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.\nFor the application of the tunneling effect, metallic tips are usually used due to their suitable densities of states of the free electrons. However, the number of free electrons or unoccupied states is significantly lower in the case of a semiconductor or insulator. As a result, higher tunneling voltages must be applied to generate a sufficient tunneling current. The elements in the material are determined by the EDX analysis in order to perform an estimation of the tunneling capability of the material. Since a metal\u2013organic material composite is deposited, the analysis of the respective atomic fractions is worthwhile in the case of this study. Previous publications show considerable deviations with respect to the material fractions of PtC structures due to the use of different equipment and deposition conditions as well as parameters of the EDX analysis (see Section 2.1).

In addition, a PtC pad is deposited with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The analysis of the atomic fractions in the PtC structure is of great importance for the tunneling suitability and fabrication of the electrode tip. If, for example, an increasing aperture current of the electron or ion beam shows an increasing platinum content in the PtC structure, a higher probability for the occurrence of platinum particles in the edge region of the tip can be derived from this. This has a direct influence on the tunneling effect. According to the literature (see Section 2.1), a significant difference in the elemental compositions of the PtC structures is to be expected due to the electron and ion beam. However, since the proportions also vary between the devices used, an investigation specifically into the dual beam used is necessary. Therefore, the EDX analysis should\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1019 5 of 16\nconfirm the literature values, on the one hand, and provide discrete values for the deposited PtC structures, on the other.\n1"

            "text": "This investigation determines the resistivity of the PtC composite. Moreover, it is already known from the literature that, depending on the beam used (FEB or FIB), the deposited material has different resistivity values. Therefore, since the material resistivity directly influences the tunneling effect and the measurement signal, it has to be investigated to characterize the tunneling current measurement. Ultimately, the resulting values are compared with the literature value of pure platinum with a resistivity \u03c1PtC of 0.105 \u2126\u00b7\u00b5m [48] at room temperature. Accordingly, the literature indicates that the resistivity of FEBID- and FIBID-Pt is four to five orders of magnitude and one to two orders of magnitude higher, respectively (see Section 2.1). The resistivity measurement should show this deviation due to contamination by carbon. Furthermore, the resistivity value has a decisive influence with regard to the geometry of the electrode tips. When tips with radii of a few nm are produced, the resistance, which is in series with the tunneling resistance, increases significantly. This can lead to a limitation of the measurement signal. For this reason, the PtC structure must be characterized according to its resistivity. Furthermore, this investigation compares the material resistance depending on the technology used (FEB or FIB) and the aperture current to deepen the EDX analysis results. To measure the resistance, free-standing PtC nanobeams of similar geometric dimensions are fabricated. The fabrication is performed directly on a MEMS chip on free-standing PolySi structures. The MEMS chip is bonded by a Wire Bonder G5 Single (F&K Delvotec) to a printed circuit board (PCB) to enable the electrical junction. Figure 4 shows the principle and an illustration of a PtC nanobeam. A total of seven PtC nanobeams are fabricated based on FEBID, with aperture currents of 43, 340, and 2.7 nA, and based on FIBID, with aperture currents of 9, 46, 90, and 260 pA.

            "text": "This study aims to investigate the possibility of using PtC tips in quantum tunneling vacuum gap applications at a low voltage range of a few hundred mV. Consequently, the EDX and RM analysis results will be validated on an STM using a HOPG probe. After deposition and patterning of the nanotip, the tunneling effect can be proven by measuring the tunneling current between a PtC electrode and a HOPG probe at distances of some nm. The atomic structures of a surface can be imaged with an STM [49]. Here, both tunneling electrodes are fixed. That is, one of the electrodes is moved via piezo actuators in the x, y, and z directions to control the sample\u2019s distance and scan it. In this way, a line-by-line image of the sample is generated. In this investigation, the NaioSTM tunneling microscope from the Nanosurf company [50] was used. Besides, the measurement or imaging of a HOPG sample allows reproducible reference measurements due to the favorable order of the atoms and represents a useful procedure for testing the tunneling suitability of electrode tips.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1019 7 of 16\nThe STM allows the PtC electrodes to be specifically tested for their tunneling suitability. The PtC electrodes are fixed so that the risk of snap-in effects can be excluded [13]. As a result, there is a large degree of independence between the selected tunneling voltage and the active area of the electrode tip with regard to attractive forces. Consequently, independent of the constraints imposed by the geometry, it is possible to obtain discrete conclusions about the electronic character in terms of tunneling suitability. The goal of the analysis is, first, to image the HOPG sample and, second, to measure the band gap. However, imaging of the sample can only be realized when the band gap or the DLC edge layer is overcome. Therefore, a minimum voltage must be selected at the tunneling electrodes. The band gap can be measured by tunneling spectroscopy. In this case, the electrode is moved close to the HOPG sample until the tunneling effect occurs. The tunneling voltage is then varied over a defined range. The resulting I/U curve shows the voltage range in which the tunneling current comes to a standstill, marking the band gap of the PtC compound at the edge of the electrode tip. Thus, the HOPG sample can then be imaged by selecting a sufficient tunneling voltage. This serves as a particularly meaningful reference for the tunneling capability of the PtC electrode tip at low tunneling voltages since the imaging of the atomic structure is only possible via the occurring tunneling effect. The analysis aims to compare the measured values based on electrode tips fabricated by choosing different parameters of an electron and an ion beam. Additionally, in NaioSTM, PtIr electrodes are preferably used because they are not subject to significant oxidation. However, due to the brittleness of the PtIr material, the electrodes can be fabricated by a wire-tearing process. Subsequently, the PtC electrodes are deposited on the PtIr wire tip using the FIB/FEB and GIS. Figure 5 shows the principle of sample preparation and an example of a PtC electrode (diameter at the anchor point \u2248 500 nm) on a PtIr wire tip (diameter \u2248 250 \u00b5m) in detail. According to the EDX analysis findings, three PtC tips were prepared using FEB (340 pA) and FIB (9 and 260 pA).

First, the band gap is visible from the tunneling spectroscopy, and second, the image of the HOPG sample shows the quality of the tunneling current based on the electrode composition. The characteristic of the I/U (current/voltage) measurement and its fit function by a third-order polynomial function shows the typical nonlinear tunneling behavior of a semiconductor. This is due to the conductance of zero in the region of the Fermi level. Doping of semiconductors can decrease the band gap and thus change the density of states at the Fermi level. Moreover, as shown by Pavlov et al. [52], decreasing the tunneling gap leads to a linearization of the I/U characteristic or shortening of the band gap. Both properties are achieved in this work by using the FIB and increasing the aperture current. The STS measurement from Figure 9a\u2013c, therefore, shows that with an increasing aperture current, there is an increasing approach to the metallic behavior, since the band gap is shortened more and more due to:\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1019 11 of 16\n\u2022 Increasing the metallic fraction according to the EDX (Figure 6) analysis; \u2022 Decreasing the distance between the metallic particles in the microstructure, which\nis visible by lowering the resistivity, according to the RM (Figure 7) and the HRTEM analysis (Figure 8).\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 17\ni t i t t l i t i t , i\ni i i l , cc r i t t ( i )\nl i ( i re 8).\nTherefore, the total distance of Pt particles, DLC layers, the vacuum gap, and the\nHOPG surface drops by increasing the beam current. Thus, a high beam current leads to\nan increase in tunneling suitability. This also becomes clear by comparing the differential\ntunneling conductance of the FEB and the FIB nanotips (insets in Figure 9a\u2013c). The I/U\nmeasurements are very noisy due to the spatial expansion of the nanotip and the irregular\narrangement of the Pt particles. Therefore, the derivatives of the I/U characteristic were\nsmoothed by a Savitzky\u2013Golay filter (filter window = 11, order of the polynomial = 3).\nAccording to Bardeen\u2019s formula [53], the density of states correlates with the differential\ntunneling conductance dI/dU [51]. The differential tunneling conductance curves in Fig-\nure 9a\u2013c confirm the characteristics of the semiconductor behavior and the shorting of the\nband gap by using the FIB and increasing the beam current.

[54]. Since this study aims to demonstrate tunneling using low tunneling voltages, the limit of the tunneling voltage can be determined by this measurement depending on the PtC tip used. Thus, the higher is the aperture current chosen, the lower is the possible tunneling voltage between the electrodes. Regarding the attractive forces, they are of utmost importance for use in a sensor application involving moving electrodes. The sensitivity can also be read directly based on the current amplitude during spectroscopy. The values of the electrode tips from Figure 9a,b are below 1 nA despite the high tunneling voltage, indicating a higher tunneling distance (total distance of Pt particles, DLC layers, vacuum gap, and HOPG surface). In contrast, the current curve in Figure 9c shows currents above 1 nA despite a significantly lower tunneling voltage. The sensitivity of the tunneling current is significantly higher here, indicating a lower tunneling distance. In contrast to low aperture currents or the use of the electron beam, this allows the sample\u2019s atomic structure to be imaged with the tips of a 260 pA ion current using small tunneling voltages (500 mV). This is an elementary finding for the application of PtC electrodes in sensor structures, and it confirms the expectations from previous analyses (EDX and resistivity measurements)."

            "text": "Examination of PtC by EDX analysis reveals significant differences in elemental content depending on the selected technology and aperture currents of FEB and FIB. Furthermore, the determination of resistivity and STM analysis allows for the comparison of electronic parameters. Thus, the results from the chosen investigation methods show which parameters of the dual beam are suitable for the implementation of the tunneling effect at low tunneling voltages. The main findings are discussed below. The EDX analysis confirms the larger Pt content in the tunneling tips due to FIBID compared with FEBID. Moreover, the Pt amount increases further with a larger aperture current. However, the variation of the accelerating voltage and the dwell time shows no significant differences in the elemental amounts. Thus, as a result of the technology, FIBID PtC has a 14\u201320% higher metal content in the microstructure due to the ion implantation of Ga+, which further increases the tunneling suitability. In addition, the resistivity of FIBID PtC is about two to three orders of magnitude higher, and that of FEBID PtC is about four orders of magnitude higher compared with the resistivity of pure Pt. The analysis shows that the resistivity increases with the reduction of the aperture current in FIBID. Looking at the EDX analysis, this is in line with the expectations. However, the higher material resistivity of FEBID PtC increases with an increasing aperture current. According to the HRTEM analysis (Figure 8), by increasing the aperture current, FEBID produces an opposing microstructure to FIBID. This leads to the hypothesis of low resistance with the most homogeneous possible distribution of small Pt particles with small spacing. This is due to the conduction mechanism of metal\u2013organic materials corresponding to intrinsic tunneling. The STM analysis also proves the tunneling effect with PtC tips. For this purpose, the imaging of a HOPG sample is investigated. The atomic structure of the graphene layer can be imaged at low tunneling voltages only with the 260 pA PtC tip. The spectroscopy measurements or the I/U characteristics of a 340 and 9 pA FEB tip and a 260 pA FIB tip demonstrate large differences in the band gap, in the sensitivity of the tunneling current, and in characteristics comparable to a semiconductor. At a larger aperture current (260 pA) using the FIB, the band gap decreases to a value between 90 and 200 mV. In contrast, the band gap for the FEB tip is about +/\u22121 V."

            "heading": "5. Summary",
            "text": "In summary, for a suitable configuration of the PtC tips to realize the tunneling effect at low tunneling voltages, the following points can be noted:\n\u2022 The platinum content must be as high as possible (Figure 6).\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1019 13 of 16\n\u2022 The platinum particles must have the smallest possible size and distance to each other. In the following, the distribution of the particles has a high density because large particles lead to larger spacings and thus higher material resistance. With a similar platinum content, according to EDX analysis (Figure 6), the PtC with smaller particle sizes, based on the HRTEM analysis (Figure 8), shows a lower resistivity. \u2022 For the production of suitable PtC electrodes, the analyses show the following two essential requirements to decrease the electrode band gap (according to STS, Figure 9) and increase the tunneling suitability:\n# The use of FIBID instead of FEBID; # The use of the highest possible aperture current (260 pA) for FIBID.\nThe measuring range of the tunneling effect depends on the electrode material and the tunneling voltage. As shown in Sections 2.1 and 3.2, the metal\u2013organic material leads to high material and tunneling resistance, thus limiting the tunneling current or the measuring range. The dependence of the tunneling voltage results in different tunneling current amplitudes due to the linear relationship between tunneling current and voltage. Due to the high resistance corresponding to the application in STM, the tunneling current assumes a maximum value of a few nA depending on the tunneling voltage. Thus, the imaging of the HOPG sample provides evidence for the tunneling suitability of the PtC tips at low tunneling voltages as long as they are fabricated with FIBID using high aperture currents (260 pA).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.H. and T.G.; methodology, M.H.; validation, M.H., M.B. and T.G.; formal analysis, M.H., T.G. and M.B.; investigation, M.H.; data curation, M.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.H., M.B., T.G. and A.Z.; visualization, M.H.; supervision, A.Z. and T.G.; funding acquisition, A.Z.
