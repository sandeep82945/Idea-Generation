    "abstractText": "Aim Based on the risk compensation theory, this study was designed to investigate the relationship between health behaviors of inpatients and COVID-19 vaccination during the epidemic with regard to the Omicron variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Taizhou, China. Subject and methods We conducted an online self-administered survey with a group of inpatients in a grade III, class A hospital in Taizhou, China, from February 27, 2022, to March 8, 2022. A total of 562 complete questionnaires were collected, and 18 questionnaires completed in under 180 seconds were rejected, leaving a total of 544 (96.8%) valid questionnaires collected. The participants who had received a COVID-19 vaccine were asked to describe the differences in their health behaviors before and after the vaccination, and the data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 22.0 software. Results There were significant differences in the percentage of individuals wearing masks (97.2% and 78.9%, P < 0.001) and the percentage of hand washing after taking off the mask (89.1% and 63.2%, P < 0.001) between the inoculated group and the uninoculated group; however, there were no significant differences in other health behaviors. The participants showed better health behaviors (handwashing and wearing a mask) after the vaccination than prior to it. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the Peltzman effect did not increase risk behaviors during the Omicron epidemic. There was no reduction in health behaviors among inpatients after the COVID-19 vaccine, which may have even improved their health behaviors.",

Vaccines have proven to be an extremely effective approach to combat prior epidemics (Wadman and You 2017). A global survey showed that respondents were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021). With the emergence of a new Omicron mutant strain, the prevention and control of the epidemic\nhave become more complicated and arduous. There were as many as 32\u201350 variants of Omicron, and 30 mutation points were concentrated on the spike proteins, which were closely related to pathogenicity and antigenicity. As a result, experts are generally concerned that the strain is more transmissible than the Delta variant, with the potential for more secondary infections and higher \u201cdrug resistance\u201d to the vaccine. Wearing masks and gloves and handwashing in public places are some of the key measures to prevent transmission and to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic (Ogoina 2020; Przekwas and Chen 2020). Therefore, during the Arcanum epidemic, compliance with health behaviors was important in reducing the risk of individual infections and controlling the spread of the epidemic.\nRisk compensation indicates that when people are perceived to be at risk, they naturally adjust their behaviors to compensate and reduce the risk (Hedlund 2000). However, as the novelty of the threat wears off, the effect of risk * Gang Wang wanggang@enzemed.com 1 Taizhou Hospital of\u00a0Zhejiang Province affiliated to\u00a0Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou\u00a0317000, China\n1 3\ncompensation tends to fade over time (Hedlund 2000). This phenomenon, in which individuals respond to safety measures with a compensatory increase in risk behaviors, is known as the \"Peltzman effect,\u201d named after the University of Chicago economist Sam Peltzman (Hedlund 2000; Peltzman 1975). During the decades since its initial description, the presence of the Peltzman phenomenon has been inconsistent, since it has been observed with some security interventions but not with others (Hedlund 2000). There is also a direct relationship between risk compensation mechanisms and behavioral differences before and after vaccination. Therefore, during the epidemic with the Omicron variant, we conducted a questionnaire survey on this issue and assessed risk compensation between health behaviors of hospitalized patients in Taizhou and COVID-19 vaccination."

The rate of wearing a face mask was 97.2% (P < 0.001), and the rate of handwashing was 89.1% (P < 0.001).\nCompared with the investigation by Sun et\u00a0al. (2022), the rate of increased health behaviors of hospitalized patients after vaccination in this study was high. Compared with pre-inoculation, the time wearing a mask increased by 35%, and the frequency of handwashing increased by 35.2%, whereas in the study by Sun et\u00a0al. the time wearing a mask increased by 17% and the frequency of washing hands increased by 18%.

The variant also contained other important amino acid mutations that alter the virus's sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies, leading the virus to evade the neutralizing effects of anti-infectious antibodies caused by previous COVID-19 infections or vaccinations, leading to a massive breakthrough infection (Garcia-Beltran et\u00a0al. 2021; Greaney et\u00a0al. 2021).\nThe main sources of information mentioned in studies, such as that by Bhagavathula (2022), are the news media and government websites. Approximately one third of the participants reported that they regularly consumed news media (television/video, newspapers, radio, and magazines), whereas a quarter (24.3%) relied on the websites of national and international health agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, and Ministry of Health (MOH), for Omicron information. In addition, 39% of the participants sometimes discussed the Omicron strain with family and friends. The government has issued a variety of guidance documents to advise the public through WeChat, radio, news, and other means of the daily\nreal-time release of relevant data. Simultaneously, all-level units and factories also set up epidemic prevention staff to guide and supervise the health behavior of employees within the department.\nThe participants in this study were inpatients. In public places, such as hospitals, special personnel has been arranged at the entrance to carry out health code, stroke code, and personnel flow track inquiries, and patients and their families are strongly advised to wear face masks. For those who do not wear masks, there is staff to remind them or issue masks to enhance the mask-wearing behavior. These measures allow people who have received the new vaccine to remain vigilant about wearing masks and to have access to medical surgical masks in public places. Even if they have forgotten their face masks, the compliance with health behaviors among inpatients increases.\nThese measures are effective and suitable for the national conditions of the \u201cdynamic zero\u201d strategy. The government uses nondrug interventions (NPI) to prevent serious outbreaks caused by the Omicron variant. First, this includes limiting the large-scale movement of people and increasing inter-provincial and inter-city traffic restrictions to reduce the cross-regional transmission of the new coronavirus. Second, the early detection and isolation of newly coronavirus-positive people and tracking of close contacts and large-scale personnel using nucleic acid screening have been emphasized. Third, the measures include increasing interpersonal distance; canceling or postponing large-scale activities, gatherings, and close-distance business entertainment places; delaying the resumption of business and school; and maintaining good personal hygiene habits. These characteristics may make inpatients more dependent on NPI and influence the outcome of health behaviors.\nAlthough the protective effect of the new COVID-19 vaccine is declining, the protective effect on severe cases and deaths remains. However, antibodies further increase after the third injection of a \u201creinforcing needle\u201d; thus, the policy of \u201cshould hit, must hit\u201d should still be carried out.\nTable 3 Experience of negative emotions (anxiety, panic, and fear) related to COVID19 prevalence and vaccine inoculation Part 1. Experience of negative emotions during COVID-19 prevalence Groups n = 544 (%) Always 4 (0.74)\nUsually 9 (1.65)\nSeldom 96 (17.65) Never 435 (79.96) Part 2. Experience of negative emotions post-inoculation compared to pre-inoculation among recipients\nof the COVID-19 vaccine Groups n = 105 (%) Increased 5 (4.76) Equal 48 (45.72) Decreased 52 (49.52)\n1 3\nThe results of the questionnaire showed that the unvaccinated groups included mainly male individuals (57.9%, P = 0.004), individuals with low education (68.4%, P = 0.011), people employed in agriculture (36.8%, P = 0.009), and the elderly (44.7%, P < 0.001). As the world is experiencing a wave of infections with the Omicron mutation, inevitably spreading to every continent, there is an urgent need for greater efforts through educational interventions targeting the general population, to improve individuals\u2019 knowledge and understanding of the Omicron variant and to promote healthy behaviors. In particular, we need to strengthen education efforts for men, the less educated, the elderly, and farmers and to develop relevant and feasible measures to guide people to actively vaccinate. During an outbreak, it is especially important to strengthen the health of this group of people and to promote their health behaviors. However, one should not expect two or even three shots to be safe. Instead, the same strict precautions should be maintained."

            "text": "There are several limitations to this study. This was a crosssectional study conducted between late February and early March 2022, when an alarming number of cases of infection with the Omicron variant were reported worldwide that could affect the general health behavior of the population. The data presented in this study were self-reported and depend on participants\u2019 honesty and recall ability, so they may be affected by recall bias. This study was limited to inpatients in a grade III, class A hospital in Taizhou. In the future, the data will be included in a larger multicenter sample to provide evidence for a better response to the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, factors such as internet access, time changes, and language barriers may influence participation. Despite these limitations, the results of this study provide insight into changes in the health behaviors of hospitalized patients at the peak of the Omicron mutant pandemic."

            "text": "In this study, the concept of risk compensation was not applicable to our results. After being vaccinated with a COVID19 vaccine, the health behaviors of the population did not decrease and may have even improved. Further large-scale population surveys are needed to determine the applicability of the risk compensation theory in association with health behaviors and COVID-19 vaccination.\nAcknowledgements We thank colleagues at the center for helpful suggestions.\nAuthors' contributions All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
