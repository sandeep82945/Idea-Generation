    "abstractText": "In-depth studies on the interaction of natural compounds with cancer-related G-quadruplex structures have been undertaken only recently, despite their high potential as anticancer agents, especially due to their well-known and various bioactivities. In this frame, aiming at expanding the repertoire of natural compounds able to selectively recognize G-quadruplexes, and particularly focusing on phenanthrenoids, a mini-library including dimeric (1\u20133) and glucoside (4\u20135) analogues of 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes, a related tetrahydropyrene glucoside (6) along with 9,10dihydrophenanthrene 7 were investigated here by several biophysical techniques and molecular docking. Compounds 3 and 6 emerged as the most selective G-quadruplex ligands within the investigated series. These compounds proved to mainly target the grooves/flanking residues of the hybrid telomeric and parallel oncogenic G-quadruplex models exploiting hydrophobic, hydrogen bond and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, without perturbing the main folds of the G-quadruplex structures. Notably, a binding preference was found for both ligands towards the hybrid telomeric G-quadruplex. Moreover, compounds 3 and 6 proved to be active on different human cancer cells in the low micromolar range. Overall, these compounds emerged as useful ligands able to target G-quadruplex structures, which are of interest as promising starting scaffolds for the design of analogues endowed with high and selective anticancer activity.",

            "text": "DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes, are promising targets for anticancer strategies in the context of targeted therapies [1,2]. G-quadruplexes are essentially located at the end of human chromosomes, i.e., at telomeres, and in the promoter regions of genes coding for oncoproteins [3,4]. Several small-molecule ligands able to interact with these structures in vitro proved to be strong anticancer agents also in vivo, thus fully confirming the potential of therapeutic approaches based on G-quadruplex ligands [5\u20137]. A large variety of synthetic compounds have been widely explored as putative Gquadruplex binders [8\u201310]. In contrast, natural compounds have been far less studied, notwithstanding that they represent appealing candidates due to their different bioactivities and high structural diversity. On this basis, we recently focused on natural compounds aiming at extending the knowledge on the interaction of this class of molecules with Gquadruplexes [11\u201316]. A particular interest was devoted to 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene and dihydrodibenzoxepin derivatives isolated from Juncaceae, which were investigated for the\nInt. J. Mol.

Among them, the dihydrodibenzoxepin derivative emerged as the strongest and most selective G-quadruplex ligand, showing anticancer activity on human cancer cells with an IC50 value of ~60 \u00b5M. In turn, dihydrophenanthrene derivatives showed lower affinity in their binding to the investigated telomeric and oncogenic G-quadruplex models [14]. Based on these results, this work was focused on the evaluation of dimeric and glucoside analogues of dihydrophenanthrenes aiming at identifying, within this class of compounds, chemical entities with improved G-quadruplex binding properties. Additionally, a related tetrahydropyrene glucoside was studied in parallel to evaluate the importance of the aglycone and sugar portions in these potential ligands in the interaction with G-quadruplex structures. In detail, the library of compounds here investigated, reported in Table 1, included the dimeric phenanthrenoids 1, 2 and 3, the dihydrophenanthrene glucosides 4 and 5, the tetrahydropyrene glucoside 6, along with the 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene 7, studied as a control.\nTable 1.

Particularly, the 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene 7 showed cytotoxic effects by the brine shrimp lethality assay (LC50 = 17.3 \u00b5M) [17]. The dimeric phenanthrenoids 1, 2 and 3 showed antialgal activities (IC50 = 21.6, 16.7 and 12.3 \u00b5M, respectively), which were higher than those detected for the related 9,10- dihydrophenanthrenes [18,19]. The dihydrophenanthrene glucosides 4 and 5 were tested for their cytotoxic effects with the brine shrimp lethality assay and were found to be inactive at concentrations up to 120 \u00b5M. Thus, comparing these data with those of their aglycone 7, it emerged that glycosylation drastically reduced the brine shrimp lethality of this class of compounds [17]. Finally, no data on the cytotoxicity of the tetrahydropyrene glucoside 6 [20] are present in the literature. Herein, these natural compounds were studied for the first time as putative anticancer agents targeting human telomeric and oncogenic G-quadruplex-forming sequences. In parallel, their interaction with duplex-forming sequences used as controls was evaluated to assess the ability of the tested compounds to selectively target G-quadruplex structures compared to the duplex DNA. The DNA/ligand interactions were investigated by the affinity chromatography-based G4-CPG (G-quadruplex on Controlled Pore Glass) assay [21\u201323], circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular modelling. Finally, the strongest and most selective binders of the G-quadruplex models were tested for their antiproliferative activity on a panel of cancer cell lines."

This assay consists of flowing through a CPG support, functionalized with the target oligonucleotide sequence, each investigated ligand diluted in a washing solution, and evaluating the amount of the DNA-bound ligand by simple UV-vis analysis carried out after treating the support with a proper releasing solution, causing full Gquadruplex and duplex denaturation. The natural compounds were first dissolved in DMSO to prepare stock solutions and then tested for their solubility in the washing/releasing aq. solution used for the assay [21\u201323]. All compounds proved to be fully soluble and stable in the assay solutions. The sequence tel26 forming a hybrid G-quadruplex [24] and the sequence c-myc folding into a parallel G-quadruplex [25] in intracellular salt conditions were used as G-quadruplex models of the human telomeric and c-myc oncogene promoter DNA, respectively. On the other hand, the sequence ds27 forming a unimolecular hairpin duplex was used as the control duplex model [26]. Overall, in our assays 1 and 4 proved to be completely unable to interact with Gquadruplex- and duplex-functionalized supports, and 5 and 7 showed a null-to-very low affinity for all the functionalized supports (Table 2). On the other hand, 2 exhibited a medium-to-high affinity for G-quadruplex-functionalized supports, however with no significant difference compared to the duplex-functionalized support (Table 2). Conversely, 3 and 6 showed some, although modest, affinity towards the G-quadruplex-functionalized supports but were associated with a good G-quadruplex vs. duplex selectivity, since no ability to interact with the duplex-functionalized support was observed (Table 2). Therefore, 3 and 6 were selected as the most promising G-quadruplex selective ligands within the here examined series. Further studies on their interaction in solution with telomeric and oncogenic G-quadruplex models, as well as a control duplex, were thus carried out by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy."

Fluorescence Spectroscopy Studies In addition to CD-based studies of the DNA/ligand interactions, fluorescence spectroscopy analyses were carried out. Unfortunately, notwithstanding its full chemical stability over time as demonstrated by UV-vis analysis, a reduction in the fluorescence intensity of 6 with time was observed (in 30 min the fluorescence intensity of its maximum was ca. 10-fold lower compared to that of the freshly prepared solution, data not shown), thus precluding any possibility of studying the binding behaviour of this compound by fluorescence spectroscopy.

As concerns the titrations of Pu22 G-quadruplex, a significant increase in the CD intensity of the 265 nm positive band as well as the 240 nm negative band was observed for both 3 and 6 (Figures 1B and 2B). On the other hand, no relevant change was detected in the 280 nm and 251 nm bands of ds12 duplex for both ligands (Figures 1C and 2C). CD melting experiments were also performed in the presence of the two ligands for each DNA sequence.

Overall, CD titration experiments demonstrated that the main folds of the tel26 Gquadruplex and the control duplex were essentially preserved upon interaction with 3 and 6, while significant effects were found on the Pu22 G-quadruplex fold in the presence of both ligands. Moreover, CD melting experiments proved that 6 exerted higher stabilizing properties than 3, also associated with a higher G-quadruplex vs. duplex selectivity."

In contrast, 3 showed a stable fluorescence over time and its spectrum was featured by a maximum at 375 nm and a shoulder at 450 nm (Figure 3, left panels, black lines). Fluorescence titration experiments were thus performed on 3 by adding increasing amounts of tel26 G-quadruplex, Pu22 G-quadruplex and ds12 duplex to solutions of the ligand kept at a fixed concentration. A dose-dependent fluorescence quenching was detected in all titration experiments (Figure 3A\u2013C), proving that 3 was able to interact with all the investigated DNA sequences. Then, the elaboration of fluorescence data allowed obtaining the binding constants for all three DNA/ligand systems. In detail, the fraction of bound ligand was calculated from the fluorescence intensity maximum values and plotted as a function of the DNA concentration. These data were then fitted with an independent and equivalent-sites model (Figure 3D\u2013F). The highest binding constant was found for the interaction between the ligand and tel26 G-quadruplex [Kb = (2.3 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 106 M\u22121], while similar constant values were obtained for the Pu22 G-quadruplex [Kb = (4.4 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 105 M\u22121] and the ds12 duplex [Kb = (6.0 \u00b1 1.7) \u00d7 105 M\u22121], revealing a preference of the ligand for the hybrid G-quadruplex model. Indeed, the observed deviation of the fitting curves, obtained by the independent and equivalent-sites model, from the fluorescence titration experimental points can be explained considering that multiple binding events, each featured by a different binding constant, can occur in the interaction of 3 with the G-quadruplex models and the control duplex. Thus, the obtained binding constants should be considered as an average of the constants related to single binding events involving 3 and each of the studied DNA sequences."

As far as the interaction of 3 with tel26 G-quadruplex is concerned, the ligand showed as the preferred binding site the central region of the groove between the first and second G-rich tract of tel26 G-quadruplex, forming a hydrogen bond between the oxygen of OH6 of 3 and the hydrogen of the exocyclic NH2 of G12 (Figure 4A). A binding energy of \u22128.3 kcal/mol was calculated for this binding pose. On the other hand, 6 targeted the free-loop groove of the tel26 G-quadruplex in the proximity of the 3\u2032-end (Figure 4B). In this case, two hydrogen bonds were found, i.e., one between the oxygen of the OH-3\u2032 of the glucose moiety of 6 and the hydrogen of the exocyclic NH2 of G23, and the other between the hydrogen of the glucose OH-4\u2032 of 6 and the phosphate oxygen of T25.

Evaluation of the Cytotoxic Effects of 3 and 6 on Human Cancer Cell Lines The antiproliferative activity on human cancer cells of 3 and 6 was determined by in vitro MTT assays on HeLa adenocarcinoma, MCF7 breast cancer and A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. As shown in Figures 5 and S1, both compounds were found to exert dosedependent toxic effects on HeLa cells already after 24 h incubation. On the other hand, significant toxic effects were detected on MCF7 cells for 3 only after 48 h incubation, with a marked dose-dependent trend observed after 72 h. In contrast, no relevant effect was observed upon treatment with 6 even after 72 h incubation, thus not allowing calculating the IC50 value for this compound on these cells. As far as A431 cells are concerned, dosedependent toxic effects were detected for 3 after 24 and 48 h incubation, whereas lower cytotoxic effects were found after 72 h incubation; in turn, dose-dependent toxic effects were observed for 6 after 48 h incubation. On the basis of the obtained results for both compounds, IC50 values were calculated for the data acquired after 48 h incubation (Table 3). IC50 values of 25, 31 and 42 \u00b5M were obtained for 3 on HeLa, MCF7 and A431 cells, respectively, while IC50 values of 32 and 44 \u00b5M were obtained for 6 on HeLa and A431 cells, respectively. Overall, with the only exception of 6 on MCF7 cells, both compounds\nFigure 4.

Ligands are represented as beige sticks. Hydrogen bonds are shown as yellow bold lines, while \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions as yellow dashed lines.\nConcerning the binding of 3 with the Pu22 G-quadruplex, the ligand was well accommodated n the free-loop groove of the Pu22 G-quadruplex in the prox mity of the 3\u2032-end (Figure 4C). A \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between the aroma i ring A of 3 and the guanine G6 was found. The binding energy for this inding se was \u22127.1 kcal/mol. On the oth r hand, 6 targeted the 3\u2032-end flanking residues of the Pu22 G-quadruplex (Figure 4D), with the formation of a hydrog n bond between the hydrogen of t e OH-2 f pyrene moiety of 6 and the N1 of A21. A binding energy of \u22127.8 kcal/mol was calculated for this binding pose. Finally, in the case of the interaction of 3 with the ds12 duplex, the most populated cluster showed a pose involving the binding of the ligand to the central region of the major groove of the duplex (Figure 4E), to which a binding energy of \u22128.0 kcal/mol was associated. A hydrogen bond between the oxygen of the OH-2\u2032 of 3 and the hydrogen of the exocyclic NH2 of A5 was observed. On the other hand, 6 targeted one of the extremities of the minor groove of the duplex (Figure 4F). A binding energy of \u22127.9 kcal/mol was calculated for this binding pose. Overall, the molecular docking analyses proved that both 3 and 6 mainly interacted with the grooves/flanking residues of the G-quadruplex and duplex models by hydrophobic, hydrogen bond and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. In agreement with the fluorescence results, the highest binding energies were found for 3 interacting with the hybrid tel26 G-quadruplex, while similar binding energies were obtained for the parallel Pu22 G-quadruplex and the\nInt.

Interestingly, the two ligands showed similar binding energies between them in the recognition of both tel26 G-quadruplex and ds12 duplex, whereas in the case of the Pu22 G-quadruplex, a significantly higher binding energy was found for 6 compared to 3, in agreement with CD thermal denaturation results."

            "text": "Seven natural compounds, i.e., the dimeric phenanthrenoids 1, 2 and 3, the dihydrophenanthrene glucosides 4 and 5, the tetrahydropyrene glucoside 6 and the 9,10- dihydrophenanthrene 7 were here evaluated as potential binders of G-quadruplex structures of different topologies. The 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene 7 was unable to bind to G-quadruplex structures, in agreement with our previous data on related analogues [14], thus definitively corroborating the finding that the 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes are not interesting as potential G-quadruplex ligands. Conversely, dimeric and glucoside derivatives of 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes proved to bind G-quadruplex structures, particularly the dimeric phenanthrenoid 3 and the tetrahydropyrene glucoside 6. Based on the obtained results, by inspection of the chemical structures of the three dimeric phenanthrenoids 1, 2 and 3, it can be inferred that the two hydroxyl groups in 3 which are absent in 1 are essential for the binding to both G-quadruplex and duplex structures, while the presence of an additional hydroxyl group (OH-5a) and the lower conformational freedom of 2 compared to 3 seem to be beneficial for the interaction to G-quadruplexes, even though detrimental in terms of G-quadruplex vs. duplex selectivity. In parallel, by comparison of the chemical structures of the three glucosides 4, 5 and 6, it is evident that all the tested 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes conjugated with a glucose unit are not good G-quadruplex binders. In contrast, if the glucose unit is linked to a pyrene-based scaffold, a higher affinity for the G-quadruplex structures is observed, thus suggesting the major role of the aglycone portion of this class of compounds vs. the sugar in G-quadruplex binding. Particularly, molecular modelling studies indicated 3 and 6 as binders of the Gquadruplex grooves. This binding mode was indeed consistent with the obtained experimental findings, i.e., the low-to-moderate affinity of the two ligands towards Gquadruplexes, as found in the G4-CPG assay, and the limited effects on the main conformations of the G-quadruplex models produced by the two ligands upon binding, as observed by CD titrations, in agreement with previous reports [11\u201316]. The higher stabilizing effects observed by CD on the parallel oncogenic G-quadruplex model compared to the hybrid telomeric one can be attributed to the binding of 6 in a region of the G-quadruplex groove close to the outer G-quartet, where the ligand can affect the G-quartets stacking. Finally, molecular modelling evidenced a binding preference of both 3 and 6 for the hybrid telomeric G-quadruplex model, which in the case of 3 could be experimentally confirmed by fluorescence titrations. Remarkably, 3 and 6 showed antiproliferative activity on different human cancer cells with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, proving to be promising compounds able to target telomeric and oncogenic G-quadruplex structures and potentially produce anticancer effects. Taken together, these data showed the two studied natural compounds, 3 and 6, as valuable leads for the design and synthesis of novel analogues which could result in optimized ligands able to selectively bind a specific G-quadruplex topology and putatively produce strong antitumour effects in the context of targeted anticancer therapies.\nInt.

The chemical identity of compounds was assessed by re-running NMR experiments and proved to be in agreement with the literature data reported for each compound [17\u201320]. The purity of the compounds, checked by reversed-phase HighPerformance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), was always higher than 95%. Stock solutions (4 mM) were prepared by dissolving a known amount of each compound in pure DMSO. A measured volume was taken from the stock solution to obtain a 60 \u00b5M compound solution in 50 mM KCl, 10% DMSO and 10% CH3CH2OH aq. solution. The detailed general procedure adopted for the G4-CPG assay is here described: weighed amounts of the nude CPG and G-quadruplex-/duplex-functionalized CPG supports (ca. 8 mg) [21] were left in contact with 300 \u00b5L of the compound solution in a polypropylene column (4 mL volume, Alltech, Washington, USA) and equipped with a polytetrafluoroethylene frit (10 \u00b5m pore size), a stopcock and a cap. After incubation on a vibrating shaker for 4 min, each support was washed with defined volumes of the washing solution (50 mM KCl, 10% DMSO, 10% CH3CH2OH aq. solution) or the releasing solution (2.5 M CaCl2, 15% DMSO aq. solution or pure DMSO) and all the eluted fractions were separately analysed by UV measurements. After treatment with the releasing solution, inducing G-quadruplexes and hairpin duplex denaturation, the supports were suspended in the washing solution and then subjected to annealing, by taking them at 75 \u25e6C for 5 min and then slowly cooling to room temperature. The oligonucleotide sequences attached to the supports were: (i) d(TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTT] (tel26), (ii) d(TGGGGAGGGTGGGGAGGGTGGGGAAGGTGGGGA) (c-myc) and (iii) d(CGCGAATTCGCGTTTCGCGAATTCGCG) (ds27). The UV measurements were performed on a JASCO V-550 UV-vis spectrophotometer. A quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm was used. The UV quantification of the compounds was determined by measuring the absorbance relative to the \u03bbmax characteristic of each compound and referring it to the corresponding calibration curves. The errors associated with the % of bound ligands are within \u00b12%."
