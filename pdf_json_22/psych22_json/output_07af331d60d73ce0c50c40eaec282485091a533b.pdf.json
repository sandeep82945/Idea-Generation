The same questionnaire as used for the\nabovementioned \u201cexperts-study\u201d was handed out to inpatient detoxification\nor rehab treatment seeking German substance-dependent adults (N = 117) for\na subsequent structured interview about harms and benefits of 33 new and\ntraditional psychoactive substances comprising also prescription drugs.\nResults and discussion: Both, users and experts, ranked the traditional\nillicit psychoactive substances heroin, cocaine and amphetamines within\nthe top overall harm level group. Synthetic cannabinoids, alcohol and\nbenzodiazepine were in a subordinate top-harm level position. Both cohorts\nalso ranked methadone, nicotine and cannabis within the midrange and\nbuprenorphine as well as psychotropic mushrooms within the lowest harm\nlevel positions. Experiences with prescription drugs (including opioidergic\nanalgesics and gabapentinoids), cathinones, GHB, methamphetamine and\nmethylphenidate was not prevalent in our user population. The same applied\nto barbiturates, propofol, kratom, ayahuasca with nearly zero assessments for\neach substance. The most user-experiences (>50% per assessed substance)\nwere reported with nicotine, cannabis, alcohol, cocaine, heroin, amphetamine\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org\nand methadone (core group). The user\u2019s overall harm ratings in terms of\nthese psychoactive substances were similar to those of the experts with the\nexception of the methadone assessment which was rated by the experts\nto be significantly less harmful if compared with the users\u2019 estimation\n(supposed \u201ctreatment bias\u201d of experts). The users\u2019 benefit ratings for the\ntraditional illicit psychoactive substances, cannabis as well as for nicotine\nwere significantly more positive in comparison to those of the experts\n(supposed \u201cattraction bias\u201d of users). Both, experts and users, ranked the\nharms arising from the use of alcohol or benzodiazepines (usually unregulated\nsubstances) higher than the harms caused by the use of methadone, cannabis\nor psychotropic mushrooms (regulated by most Western narcotic acts). Users\nattributed the most benefits to buprenorphine, methadone and cannabis.\nThis might reflect a main limitation of the study as the data are from an\nuser population comprising over 50% patients who sought detoxification-\ntreatment of opiates where methadone and buprenorphine are usual transient\nmedications (supposed \u201cselection bias\u201d).\nConclusion: This study addressed current trends of psychoactive substance\nabuse (e.g., synthetic cannabinoids, prescription drugs) and provides from\nboth perspectives (that of the user and that of the addiction medicine\nexperts) robust harm/benefit evaluations at least of a core group of\npsychoactive substances (traditional illicit psychoactive substances, cannabis,\nmethadone, alcohol and nicotine). The results of this study can be valuable\nto the psychoeducation of substance-addicted individuals and to current\nrestriction/legalization debates, especially in the Western-EU.\nKEYWORDS\ntraditional illicit drugs, cannabis, new psychoactive drugs, ketamine, assessment bias, prescription drugs, pregabalin, gabapentin"

            "text": "Persons who are using psychoactive substances have a lot of motives in doing so besides medical-therapeutic reasons. Nonmedical motives comprise, e.g., self-medication, recreational, mind-altering, spiritual, affect-regulating, relaxing, doping, cognition-enhancing or sleep-improving purposes. As a rule, those aims are perceived as \u201cbeneficial.\u201d However, the most psychoactive substances are also \u201chijacking\u201d the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system as a biological condition sine qua non for burgeoning and maintaining addictive behavior (1\u20134). The rewarding vigor of an individual psychoactive substance, as well as its availability, the context cues and the user\u2019s vulnerability are powerful predictors of a substance abuse and dependence (ICD-10, DSM-IV TR III) or substance use-disorder (SUD) (3\u20135). Severely affected persons are compulsively using multiple psychoactive substances for nonmedical purposes, displaying substance misuse spiraling out of executive self-control (4, 5). They invest a lot of their lifetime to get these substances to maintain pleasant intoxication effects\n(e.g., feeling \u201chigh,\u201d relaxed or energetic) and to avoid physical and behavioral withdrawal; in sum this often leads to personal and social depravation; and in the case of illicit psychoactive substance use, more probably to delinquent behavior and substance related deaths (3\u20135).\nNutt et al. developed a consensus-based rating instrument for assessing an individual psychoactive substance\u2019s overall harm potential considering physical, psychological and social harms to users and others (6). Within the last 20 years, several ratings by experts in the area of addictive disorders were carried out in several Western European countries and Australia (1, 6\u2013 12). These rankings do not necessarily show congruence with legislative and law enforcement priorities in terms of regulation and control of substances, with alcohol being a classic example of dissonance between a high level of overall harm and low levels of governmental regulation (1, 6\u201313). Few expert rankings also included potential beneficial effects of psychoactive substances (9, 14); and only one study included several prescription drugs being currently debated to be addictive, such as Non-Steroidal\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nAnti-Inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and gabapentinoids (GPTs) (1, 14).\nAs of September 2022, there are very few comparative rankings of perceived harms and benefits arising from the use of psychoactive substances, which have been carried out by substance users (15, 16). However, these are essential to understand the relevance of the experts\u2019 rankings for naturalistic treatment conditions and psychoeducation approaches. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study including adult Germans undergoing an inpatient drug detoxification or inpatient drug users\u2019 rehabilitation treatment. The results from the users\u2019 perspective were compared with the results of the ranking of German addiction medicine experts, which have been recently published (1, 14). Users\u2019 and experts\u2019 rankings were based upon data collected within 2016 to 2019 in Germany and therefore, should reflect some regional as well common trends, including the emergence of novel psychoactive substances, such as synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones (17, 18), see also Supplementary material 2.1), or the increasing misuse of gabapentinoids (1, 19) and further prescription analgesics (20). We hypothesize that also in our study the rankings of both, experts and users, were not congruent with the narcotics acts of Western nations, at least for the position of alcohol. Furthermore, the results might be of interest for current restriction debates (e.g., domestic and abroad for gabapentinoids and alcohol) or legalization debates (e.g., for cannabis or psychotropic mushrooms) (21\u201323)."

Both hospitals are located close to each other, within the metropolitan Ruhr Area (see Supplementary material 2.1), Germany. The concept of this study (spanning from March 2017 to January 2019, Supplementary Figure 2) is the similar to our previous study (surveys carried out from March 2016 to May 2018, Supplementary Figure 2), which included addiction medicine experts recruited at German addiction congresses and conferences (1, 14).

Inclusion criteria were: to be a physician who (i) was a specialist, i.e., had extra expertise in at least one medical specialty and (ii) had been working longer than 5 years in German hospitals in the area of substance use disorders (SUD) treatment. The first experts\u2019 survey was conducted from March 2016 to September 2017 (Supplementary Figure 2) and assessed the average harm of 33 substances (Figure 1) in 5 dimensions (physical harm to users, psychological harm to users, social harm to users, physical and psychological harm to others, and social harm to others). As shown in Supplementary Figure 1, these dimensions were defined by 16 criteria, which have been validated in several studies of this type (6, 8, 12) (see Supplementary material 2: \u201cMethods\u201d). Overall harm to users and overall harm to others comprised three (physical, psychological, social) dimensions and two (physical & psychological, social) dimensions, respectively (for details see Supplementary Figure 1). The assessments were carried out using 5-point scales (from \u201cnot harmful\u201d to \u201cextremely harmful\u201d). Furthermore, overall beneficial substance effects were rated per 3-point scales (\u201cno/little\u201d/\u201cmoderate\u201d/\u201ca lot\u201d).\nThe expert cohort comprised 101 participants. The physicians were advised to decide for themselves whether to assess a substance or not, and they were instructed to estimate their professional experience (\u201cno/little\u201d/\u201cmoderate\u201d/\u201ca lot\u201d) with each substance they had rated. This information was used to determine the validity of the ratings and to verify defined exclusion criteria. In this context, a substance with less than 60% ratings was excluded from further analysis. Thus, the substances ayahuasca, khat, and kratom had to be excluded from the experts\u2019 harm and benefit evaluation (1, 14). The second experts\u2019 survey (for determining the relative weight of each health and social harm dimension to calculate the overall harm of each assessed substance, see Supplementary Figure 1) was conducted from September 2017 to May 2018 by cohort 2 (Supplementary Figure 2), which were recruited from the emails to 40 heads of German substance addiction treatment centers. This survey was separate because the first survey was very comprehensive; and combining the two surveys was deemed likely to reduce the return rate of cohort 1. All 36 returned questionnaires could be included. We used the mean relative weight given by the 36 experts to each dimension for calculating the overall harm of each substance (Table 1)."

However, these results might be of interest for current restriction debates according to gabapentinoids (19, 25). As found within previous studies (6, 8, 9, 12, 16), also in our study, the rankings were not congruent with the narcotics acts of Western nations, because both, users and experts, ranked the harms arising from the use of alcohol or benzodiazepines (usually unregulated substances) higher than the harms caused by the use of methadone, cannabis or psychotropic mushrooms, i.e., substances being regulated by most Western narcotics acts.\nComparison with previous studies\nThe \u201cbackbone\u201d of this rank order is similar to those determined by the most previous substance harm ratings with the following most apparent exception: alcohol was assessed to hold the largest overall harm level according to a majority of expert studies (6, 8, 9, 12) as well as a comparative experts-versus-user study (16).

The user group of the present study assigned methadone and buprenorphine to produce the largest beneficial effects. This assessment differed from prior user evaluations which preferred alcohol, tobacco and cannabis (9, 15, 16).

The user\u2019s overall harm ratings in terms of these core-group psychoactive substances were similar to those of the experts with the exception of the methadone assessment which was rated by the experts to be significantly less harmful if compared with the users\u2019 estimation (availability bias by experts\u2019 positive treatment and mortality-risk-reducing experiences with methadone in opioid addicts (28): \u201ctreatment bias\u201d).\nNotably, the users\u2019 benefit ratings for the traditional illicit psychoactive substances heroin, cocaine, cannabis as well as for nicotine were significantly more positive in comparison with those of the experts. This phenomenon becomes especially obvious if we look at the missing userassignments of substances in the category of substances with less benefit and great harm in Figure 9, which is clearly contrasting to the experts assessments. We assumed an underlying specific \u201cuser bias\u201d resulting from a hedonic imbalance of the dopaminergic mesolimbic reward system (2) due to past addictive substance use experiences (\u201cattraction bias\u201d; resembling the \u201cvalence or hedonic tone bias\u201d of emotions). This special bias of addicted persons might foster their substance craving and affective decision-making to relapse. In this regard, a large body of investigations supported a special implicit cognition of addicted persons, acquired by repetitive use of addictive substances or behaviors. Modern addiction theories are based upon this knowledge. In this context, it is hypothesized that repetitive rewarding/reinforcing substance use mediates (i) a sensitization of frontolimbic networks through which substance-related stimuli become emotionally/motivationally salient (attention bias; \u201cattraction bias\u201d) as well as (ii) an inhibition of cognitive control functions (both in the sense of addiction-related specific executive cognitive dysfunctions) (29\u201331). The modulation of these cognitive dysfunctions/biases is regarded as key challenge in the treatment of substance addiction (32)."

            "text": "The representativeness of the users\u2019 assessments is narrowed to a population of inpatient drug detoxification/rehab seeking adults of a Western German metropole region. The robustness of the experts\u2019 and users\u2019 overall harm rankings after stressing the results by sensitivity analyses (with EUweights) might at least partially ameliorate this problem. Nonetheless, the compliance deficit of users (great portion of non-responses to substance-specific questions) and the corresponding exclusion of hazardous psychoactive substances,\nsuch as methamphetamine, which is considerably more stronger distributed, e.g., in the Eastern EU and Eastern provinces of Germany (1), consists to be a major limitation of this study. Similarly, users and experts from populations who are/were affected by an opioid epidemic most likely might assess the harm/benefit ratio of prescription opioids and gabapentinoids clearly greater than our participants residing in a region without opioid epidemic experiences (25), although about 50% of the participating users had wanted a detoxification of opioids (heroin and opioid maintenance medication). On the other hand, methadone and buprenorphine are common transient medications being used during these detoxification treatments, which can be considered as a further main limitation (selection bias). As this study addressed current trends of psychoactive substance abuse (e.g., synthetic cannabinoids, opioid analgesics, gabapentinoids) and provides robust evaluations at least of a core group of psychoactive substances comprising traditional illicit psychoactive substances, cannabis and nicotine, the results of this study can be valuable to the psychoeducation of addicted individuals and to current restriction/legalization debates. Furthermore, we found further evidence of a special bias (\u201cattraction bias\u201d) of substance-addicted persons in the self-evaluation of harms and benefits of psychoactive substance uses as well as a \u201ctreatment bias\u201d of addiction medicine experts assessing harmful psychoactive substances, less harmful as they actually are, as becoming particularly apparent here in the case of methadone."

            "text": "This study provides the assessments of users and addiction medicine experts with respect to the harms and benefits of various psychoactive substances, including traditional illicit psychoactive substances, cannabis, alcohol, and nicotine. Also, some modern psychoactive substance use trends related to synthetic cannabinoids and gabapentinoids (Supplementary material S5) were considered. Both, experts and users, ranked the harms arising from the use of alcohol or benzodiazepines (usually unregulated substances) higher than the harms arising from the use of methadone, cannabis or psychotropic mushrooms (regulated by most Western narcotic acts). Thus, also in our study the rankings were not congruent with the narcotics acts of Western nations (as we have hypothesized). The results could be valuable to the psychoeducation of addicted individuals and to current restriction/legalization debates, especially in the Western EU. Comparing the users\u2019 and experts\u2019 substance harm and benefit assessments pointed to a special bias\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 12 frontiersin.org\nof addicted persons (\u201cattraction bias\u201d) and a \u201ctreatment bias\u201d of addiction medicine experts."
