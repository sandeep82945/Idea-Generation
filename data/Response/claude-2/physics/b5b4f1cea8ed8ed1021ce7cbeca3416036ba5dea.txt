 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on the dynamics of pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) in its plastic phase:

1. Investigate the dynamics of other hexa-substituted benzene compounds in their plastic phases using a similar combined approach of X-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simulations. This could reveal commonalities and differences across this class of materials. 

2. Perform more extensive molecular dynamics simulations on longer timescales and larger system sizes to better capture diffusive motions and improve statistics. This could provide further insights into the homogeneous vs heterogeneous dynamics.

3. Conduct dielectric spectroscopy measurements over a wider temperature range on both powder and single crystal samples. Comparing to simulations could help understand the role of crystallinity. 

4. Use neutron scattering techniques like quasielastic neutron scattering to study the dynamics on fast timescales and provide additional validation for the molecular simulations.

5. Develop coarse-grained or reduced-dimensionality models of the dynamics, informed by the all-atom simulations, to enable accessing even longer time and length scales. This could reveal new physics related to cooperative motions.
