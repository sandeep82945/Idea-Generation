Among low-dimensional materials, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are of particular interest for photodetection applications, owing to their high absorption cross-sections, long carrier diffusion lengths, and tuneable optical properties.20 Recently, lead halide-based inks (PbX2, X = Br or I),21 hybrid MAPbBr3, 6,7 MAPbX3, 8 CH3NH3PbI3,\n9 and (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n\u22121PbnI3n+1\n10 perovskites were inkjetdeposited to produce photodetectors with photoresponsivity up to \u223c10 A W\u22121.7 Compatibility of AM techniques with different substrates allows the integration of these new materials with conventional silicon based technologies,12 as well as the fabrication of photodetectors on flexible substrates, such as polyethylene \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

We explore different approaches to fabricate perovskite/graphene photodetectors, both combining fabrication of conventional graphene/SiO2/Si with inkjet and fully inkjet deposited heterostructures, and propose a qualitative model that links together their electronic (conductivity, carrier mobility) and optoelectronic (photosensitivity, response time) properties. We explore the deposition of these photosensitive layers onto chemical vapour deposition (CVD) grown single layer graphene (SLG), as well as inkjet deposited graphene (iGr) films to produce photodetectors with high responsivities up to 106 A W\u22121, tuneable in the VIS\u2013UV range. By inkjet deposition of electrodes (Au nanoparticle inks), graphene, and perovskites we demonstrate a fullyprinted CsPb(Br/I)3/iGr photon detector, with a maximum responsivity of about 20 A W\u22121. The performance of these\ndevices is analysed and explained using modelling of charge transport through functionalised graphene and graphene networks. The compatibility of inkjet deposition with conventional Si-based substrates and devices, and with flexible substrates could enable numerous opportunities, from displays to optoelectronic devices."

The NCs had an average size of 11 \u00b1 1 nm and were hexagonal in shape with high crystallinity as expected for the used synthesis method,25 which leads to the formation of polyhedral perovskite nanocrystals due to ammonium ions stabilization of different crystal facets. A lattice spacing of 0.41 \u00b1 0.02 nm was measured from HRTEM images, which corresponds to (110) plane of cubic CsPbBr3 26 (Fig. 1b and ESI, SI1, Fig. S1\u2020). These NCs are stable with respect to their optical properties for a period of at least 2 months (ESI, SI1 and Fig. S2\u2020). To formulate the inks, the NCs were added to a mixture of hexane, cyclohexanone, and terpineol (1 : 3 : 1 v/v) at a concentration of 5 mg ml\u22121. The composition of the ink was optimised to achieve the viscosity of 1.53 mPa s, surface tension of 37.8 mN m\u22121, and density of 1.33 g cm\u22123, which renders it suitable for inkjet deposition.

The inks were deposited using a 20 \u00b5m drop spacing in an inert N2 atmosphere to avoid NC oxidation. Printed perovskite NC films were dried on the heated print-bed at T = 60 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. Two types of perovskite NCs with different halogen contents were formulated into inks as described above: green CsPbBr3 and red CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs (Fig. 1c and d), which have photoluminescence (PL) emissions centred at 515 nm and 625 nm, respectively (Fig. 1d). Both inks demonstrated bright fluorescence under UV illumination both before and after deposition and drying (Fig. 1a, c and d).\nWe note that uniform films are formed using a single printed layer. Only a factor of 2 difference between the maximum and minimum PL intensity was recorded on PL maps of these samples (Fig. 1e) and is attributed to the surface roughness, which correlates with the printed line spacing. The surface roughness is reduced with increasing number of layers and more uniform maps of PL intensity are recorded. Importantly, thermal annealing, which is typically used as post deposition process (T = 100 \u00b0C), has a negligible effect on the film morphology and optical properties (see ESI, SI2 and Fig. S3\u2020). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images revealed that CsPbBr3 films with 5 printed layers had a thickness of \u223c20 nm, with a surface roughness of \u223c5 nm (see ESI, SI3 and Fig. S4\u2020).\nCsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs were deposited onto a CVD grown graphene field effect transistor (FET), SLG/SiO2/Si, by inkjet printing to fabricate CsPb(Br/I)3/SLG and CsPbBr3/SLG devices (Fig. 2a). The gate voltage, Vg, dependence of SLG resistivity before and after deposition of CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs revealed a\nlarge hysteresis when Vg was swept from \u221250 V to +50 V and then back to \u221250 V with a sweep rate of 0.1 V s\u22121 (Fig. 2a). The observed hysteresis of the \u03c1(Vg) dependence is due to slow charging of the perovskite NCs.2,29 This was accompanied by a shift of the position of the Dirac point from +11 V to 0 V, thus indicating n-type doping of the SLG by CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs. Similar n-type doping of SLG has previously been observed on SLG functionalised with CsPbI3 NCs, due to the donor nature of CsPbX3 NCs. 2\nThe electron and hole field-effect mobilities of the SLG device before NC deposition were calculated at the point of the highest slope of \u03c3(Vg) (highest value of \u03bcFE) for both electrons and holes using the method reported in29,30 (see Methods section). For pristine SLG, \u03bce = 0.70 m\n2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 and \u03bch = 0.55 m2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121, respectively. After deposition of CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs, the mobilities decreased to \u03bce = 0.53 m\n2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 and \u03bch = 0.40 m2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 during forward voltage sweeps (\u221250 V to +50 V) and increased to \u03bce = 0.73 m 2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 and \u03bch = 0.64 m 2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 during backward voltage sweeps (+50 V to \u221250 V) (see ESI, SI3 and Fig. S5\u2020). Dependence of the field effect mobility on the direction of the Vg sweep can be explained using slow charge dynamics in the CsPbX3/SLG devices.\n2 The Vg position of the Dirac point of the CsPbBr3/SLG device was also shifted to the left, consistent with n-type doping, as discussed above. A small increase in electron mobility and decrease in hole mobility was observed in the CsPbBr3/SLG device from \u03bce = 0.33 m 2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 and \u03bch = 0.53 m 2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 before NC deposition to \u03bce = 0.38 m2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 and \u03bch = 0.36 m 2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 after NC deposition (see ESI, SI3 and Fig. S5\u2020). The difference between the devices decorated with CsPb(Br/I)3 and CsPb(Br)3 is likely due to the differences in the properties of the pristine graphene before deposition.\nFig. 2 (a) Schematic of deposition of all-inorganic perovskite NCs via inkjet printing on a single layer graphene (SLG) device (top).

After illumination, the electrical properties of the devices recover to \u223c90% of the original value in about a minute, however the full recovery can take up to several hours for large incident illumination powers (see ESI, SI3 and Fig. S5\u2020), which is likely due to the charge trapping on NC surface defects and slow charge dynamic.29 For both devices, the relationship between incident light power, P, and the responsivity, R, follows R \u223c P\u22120.7 (Fig. 2c), similar to the R(P) previously reported for SLG decorated with CsPbI3 NCs.\n2 A much greater maximum photoresponse was observed for the CsPb(Br/I)3 device (R = 4 \u00d7 10\n6 A W\u22121) than by the CsPbBr3 device (R = 7 \u00d7 103 A W\u22121), with excitation and relaxation response times of \u03c4rise \u223c 2 s and \u03c4fall \u223c 6 s (see ESI, SI3 and Fig. S5\u2020). The difference in photoresponsivity of the photodetectors decorated with different perovskite NCs is due to the NC composition, which affects their absorption (Fig. 1d) and energy level alignment with SLG for charge transfer (inset in Fig. 2c). Since higher levels of absorptions at the used excitation energy (405 nm) and longer lifetimes of photoexcited trapped charges are observed for mixed halide CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs, these devices have higher photoresponsivity compared to CsPbBr3 NC decorated devices. The device performance was stable for a period of up to 2 weeks. (ESI, SI3 and Fig. S6\u2020).\nThe next step towards fully printed photodetectors was to replace the CVD grown SLG with an inkjet-printed graphene (iGr) current channel. A single droplet of iGr ink was deposited onto a Si/SiO2 FET between two pre-patterned gold contacts separated by a 20 \u03bcm gap. Perovskite CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs were deposited onto iGr by drop-casting (Fig. 3a). The conductivity, \u03c3sd, of this CsPb(Br/I)3/iGr device as a function of gate voltage, Vg, showed a shift in the Dirac point from Vg \u223c 60 V for pristine\ngraphene to Vg \u223c 50 V after (Fig. 3b) for NC functionalised device, indicating n-type doping, similar to that previously observed for the CsPbX3/SLG devices (Fig. 2a). The hole mobility \u00b5h = 3 cm\n2V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 was measured for both pristine iGr and CsPb(Br/I)3/iGr devices. However, after deposition of the perovskite NCs the conductivity of the device decreased by \u223c7% across the whole range of the applied Vg. Similar change of the conductivity, without shift of the Dirac point or change of mobility, was observed for iGr samples with different thickness (i.e. 1, 2 or 3 droplets printed on top of each other). We ascribe the reduction of the conductivity after the NC deposition to the intermixing of the NCs and iGr, leading to the reduction of the effective layer thickness. The value of mobility and the hysteresis of the \u03c3sd(Vg) dependence observed for pristine iGr device (Fig. 3b) are not affected by the surface deposition of CsPb(Br/I)3.\nThe photoresponsivity threshold of the CsPb(Br/I)3/iGr device is observed at \u223c600 nm (see ESI, SI5 and Fig. S8\u2020), similar to the responsivity threshold observed in the CsPb(Br/ I)3/SLG device. The relationship between responsivity and incident power for the CsPb(Br/I)3/iGr device followed R \u223c P\u22120.5 dependence with a maximum responsivity of 101 A W\u22121 and a response time constant of \u03c4rise = 6 s (inset in Fig. 3c). Note, high photoresponsivity in CsPbX3/graphene photodetectors is proportional to the ratio between perovskite NC charge trapping time, \u03c4trap, and electron transport time, \u03c4e \u223c1/\u03bc, i.e. the time it takes an electron to pass through the device, R \u223c \u03c4trap/ \u03c4e.\n31 Our iGr devices demonstrate field effect mobility, \u00b5FE \u22483 cm2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 and SLG FETs show \u00b5FE \u22486000 cm2 V\u22121\u00b7s\u22121. Thus, the responsivity of iGr devices should be at least 3 orders of magnitude lower than the responsivity of SLG devices decorated with the same perovskite NCs.\nTo reduce manufacturing complexity by enabling one-step fabrication of photon detectors, we formulate a hybrid ink containing graphene and perovskite NCs as charge transport and\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Nanoscale, 2023, 15, 2134\u20132142 | 2137\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The hybrid i(Gr-CsPbX3) ink was formulated with the final NC concentration of 5 mg ml\u22121. Printed hybrid i(Gr-CsPbX3) films displayed larger sheet resistance than iGr (\u03c1s = 3.5 \u00d7 10\n5 \u03a9 sq\u22121 for 5 printed layers) due to the presence of perovskite NCs, which disrupt conductive graphene pathways, and increased flake-to-flake junction resistance.32 The hybrid layers deposited onto flexible Kapton substrate had stable electrical performance over at least 200 bending cycles. The i(Gr-CsPb(Br/I)3) device displayed a maximum responsivity of 10\u22123 A W\u22121 and the relationship between responsivity and incident power followed R \u223c P\u22120.5 (see ESI, SI6 and Fig. S9\u2020). The performance of hybrid devices could be improved by optimising the ink formulation and post deposition treatment, which merits future studies.\nWe also successfully fabricated fully inkjet-printed CsPb(Br/ I)3/iGr heterostructure devices (Fig. 4a) with a pair of Au contact pads printed using AuNP ink33 onto Si/SiO2 with a gap of \u223c30 \u00b5m. A single printed line of iGr was deposited across the gold-electrodes and functionalised with inkjet deposited CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs. The sheet resistance of the iGr increased after inkjet deposition of CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs from 10 k\u03a9 sq\u22121 to 11 k\u03a9 sq\u22121 (see ESI, SI7 and Fig. S10\u2020). Depth profiling using time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) revealed the presence of perovskites throughout the iGr layer. Thus we propose that intermixing between the perovskite and iGr layers was the cause of the observed increase of resistance (Fig. 4b). The CsPb(Br/I)3/iGr device displayed a responsivity of 20 AW \u22121 (Fig. 4c), which is about 2-times greater compared to the dropcast CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs/iGr device (Fig. 3c). The photoresponsivity threshold of the printed CsPb(Br/I)3/iGr device is comparable to the previous CsPb(Br/I)3 devices (inset in Fig. 4c).\nThe different responsivities measured in perovskite decorated CVD graphene and iGr devices can be attributed to a large (over 3 orders of magnitude) decrease of carrier mobility, which results in longer transport times in iGr, as expected for graphene networks.4 The difference in the responsivity of the iGr-CsPbBr3 hybrid device and the inkjet-printed CsPbBr3/iGr\nheterostructure devices could be due to the difference in measured sheet resistance. The fully printed CsPb(Br/I)3/iGr device uses an iGr line (R \u223c 5 k\u03a9) whereas the drop-cast CsPb (Br/I)3/iGr device used a single printed drop of iGr, which has lower number of graphene flakes and higher resistance (R \u223c 10 k\u03a9). However, the complete interrogation of these differences requires further detailed studies. We suggest that incorporation of perovskite NCs into the matrix of iGr significantly affects electronic transport due to increasing intra-flake distance and porosity. Thus, the nature of the junctions has a significant impact on inter-nanosheet charge transfer, which affects both the carrier mobility and conductivity.32 As such, the change in morphology and porosity of graphene films within the device can lead to large changes in the total conductivity.4 For a percolating network, the total conductance can be described by G = GC/r where r is a characteristic scale of the system and GC is the critical conductance, defined as the junction of lowest conductance within the path of highest total conductance across the full length of the network.34\u201336 The conductivity between flakes, G, depends exponentially on the flake separation distance, d, G \u223c e\u2212\u03b1d where \u03b1 is the inverse localisation radius, given by \u03b1 = (2/\u0127)\u221a(2m\u03d50) where m is the effective mass in the tunnelling region between flakes, and \u03d50 is the work function associated with the flakes.37 Estimating these parameters as the free electron mass, m = 9.11 \u00d7 10\u221231 kg, and graphene work function, \u03d50 \u2248 4.5 eV,38 we can characterise the difference in measured resistance between the iGr and the iGr-CsPbX3 composite as a small change in the critical distance between percolating flakes, \u03b4d \u223c 0.2 nm, caused by the introduction of perovskite NCs into the flake network.\nThe photoresponsivity achieved in this work is significantly higher than that reported previously,6\u201310,16 which we attribute to the enhanced stability of all inorganic perovskites used in our work and the optimised ink formulation. Perovskite NCs can be susceptible to environmental degradation, which is normally attributed to the loss of capping ligands and /or poor passivation of surface defects. The presence of a large density\n2138 | Nanoscale, 2023, 15, 2134\u20132142 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

We attribute the higher responsivity observed in our devices to NC stability, which is enabled by efficient surface passivation (and low surface defect density). An additional significant benefit of the enhanced stability of our perovskite NCs is their ability to withstand the inkjet deposition and post deposition processes and provide stable performance in the device.\nWe demonstrate successful inkjet printing of continuous thin films of all-inorganic perovskite NCs over large areas (>1 cm) and fully printed photodetectors sensitive in the UV-Vis range. The photoresponsivity of >103 AW\u22121 was demonstrated for both red and green emitting perovskite NC inks on SLG. The lower responsivity R > 101 A W\u22121 measured for the same perovskite inks used to decorate iGr is explained by lower charge mobility in graphene networks compared to SLG. Our experiments and analysis of the device performance provide a future strategy for development of nanomaterials for fully additively manufactured optoelectronics."

The stability of the perovskites used and of the ink developed, enabled us to explore the potential of these inks as photosensitive layers in graphene based photon detectors, including fully printed devices. Our work addresses current challenges by increasing the availability of optically active materials for additive manufacturing technologies. Establishing a library of conductive (AuNP and graphene inks) and semiconducting (perovskite nanocrystals) materials, we achieved printed photon detectors with the highest photoresponsivity in UV-vis range reported to date for similar inkjet fabricated devices. We also demonstrated perovskite/graphene devices produced using a combination of different techniques, from conventional device processing to inkjet printing. Performance of the fabricated devices was explained using the photoresponsivity model based on the ratio of photoexcited charge trapping/electron transport time or responsivity/response time ratio. The results reported here are of fundamental and technological interest, as it provides opportunities for surface functionalisation of devices produced using convectional Si-technologies as well as potential applications in flexible/wearable optoelectronics."
