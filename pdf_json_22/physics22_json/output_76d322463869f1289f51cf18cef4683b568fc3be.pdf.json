    "abstractText": "Polarization-control devices have attracted considerable interest, however, most of the polarization converters operating at lower frequencies have a heavy design and narrow bandwidth which limits their practical applications. Here we report a simple design of an ultra-wideband and lightweight polarization converter for applications in the Sand C-bands. The proposed converter is designed based on a metasurface structure with the dielectric layer modified to hollow structure to obtain a lightweight design even working at such low frequency. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the converter can convert the orthogonal polarization transformation of reflected wave. Furthermore, the measurement results show good agreement with the simulation results. The proposed polarization converter can achieve a polarization conversion ratio above 90% in an ultra-wide frequency range from 2 to 8.45 GHz due to multi-resonance modes. These performances are going beyond state of the art in terms of bandwidth and lightweight design, thus it can be applied in various applications in the operating bands.

INTRODUCTION\nTOGETHER with frequency, phase, and energy, polar-ization is one of the crucial characteristics of electromagnetic (EM) waves since it is taken into consideration in most EM applications. Therefore, the controlling polarization state of an EM wave plays an important role to broaden its practical applications. The term EM polarization refers to the oscillating direction of the electric field in a plane perpendicular to the propagated direction of the EM wave. Normally, a polarization converter is used to control the EM polarization. Conventional polarization converters are achieved by using either birefringent crystals based on Faraday effects [1], optical gratings [2], or employing the Brewster [3], [4]. Therefore, the conventional designs are usually heavy-weight, difficult in miniaturization, and narrow\nbandwidth, which limits their practical applications [5], [6]. Since then, many efforts have been made to overcome the disadvantage of the conventional polarization converters [7]\u2013 [18]. Among the proposed methods, using metamaterials (MMs) is considered as a potential approach to developing a new class of miniaturized and wideband polarization converter [15]\u2013[18].\nMetasurface has proved as an effective method to realize lightweight absorber [19], vortex beam generator [20], holograms [21], lens [22], cloaks [23], and surface plasmon polariton couplers [24] due to its advantages such as ultrathin thickness and scalable property. Normally, a metasurface is formed by arranging unit cells into a two-dimensional pattern at a surface or interface, therefore, they are considered as a two-dimensional equivalent of metamaterials. Among the\nVOLUME 4, xxxx 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nT. M. Nguyen et al.: Ultra-Wideband and Lightweight Electromagnetic Polarization Converter\ndifferent types of metasurface, anisotropic or chiral metasurface has demonstrated a convenient method to control the polarization state of electromagnetic waves. However, the polarization converters based on the anisotropic and chiral metasurfaces shown either a narrow bandwidth or low conversion efficiency [15]. Therefore, most of previous studies on this kind of polarization converter focus on expand the bandwidth by using stacking multilayer structures [16], [17] or using multiple plasmon resonances [13], [25]. However, the multilayer structures also lead to a bulky volume while the polarization based on multile resonances mothod shows a low polarization conversion ratio (PCR) below 50% [13]. Since then, the design of a polarization converter with miniaturized design while maintaining high conversion rate in a wide bandwidth is still a major challenge.\nIn this work, we present a high conversion efficiency and ultra-wideband polarization converter with a simple and lightweight design. The proposed polarization converter is the linear type that rotates a linearly polarized EM wave into its orthogonal counterpart. The unit cell of the proposed converter is composed of a metallic pattern as a resonator mounted on a hollow FR-4 dielectric substrate to achieve the lightweight characteristic. The multiple resonances that are produced by both electric and magnetic resonances can be used to obtain the ultra-wideband characteristic. The proposed converter shows the PCR above 90% with a relative bandwidth (RBW) of 123.4% in the wide band from 2.0 GHz to 8.45 GHz.\nII. DESIGN AND SIMULATION Figure 1 shows a schematic of the designed unit cell of the proposed polarization converter. The polarization converter\u2019s structure consists of a periodic array of an anisotropic metasurface unit cell (not shown here). As shown in Fig. 1(a), the unit cell of the proposed polarization converter is composed of two identical FR-4 substrate layers separated by an air gap. A metallic pattern is etched on the top side of the upper substrate plays as a resonator. Meanwhile, the bottom side of the lower substrate is backed by a continuous metal sheet which plays as a ground plane. The loss tangent and relative dielectric constant of the FR-4 substrate are 0.025 and 4.3,\nTABLE 1. Optimum parametric value of the unit cell of the polarization converter.\nParameter P k h a b s L R Value (mm) 22.2 10 0.8 1.54 0.75 2.7 10.3 9.3\nFIGURE 2. (a) Simulated magnitude and phase difference off co- and cross-polarization reflections, and (b) Simulated PCR versus frequency under normal incidence and TE mode.\nrespectively. The metallic pattern plays as a resonator which is composed of two opposite arcs connected by a strip at the center (Fig. 1(b)). The top and bottom layers of unit cell are made of copper, which has a thickness of 0.035 mm and an electric conductivity of 5.96 \u00d7 107 S/m. The geometrical parameters of the unit cell are shown in Table 1. It is worth to mention that a thicker dielectric contributes to a lower radiative Q-factor and can therefore enhance the operational bandwidth [26]. However, a unit cell with actual (solid) and thick substrate normally is heavy, therefore, the airgap is introduced here as a solution to achieve the wideband and lightweight characteristics at the same time.\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed polarization converter, the commercial CST Microwave Studio 2015 software is performed using a frequency-domain solver. The unit cell boundary conditions are assigned to the x-and y-directions, while open conditions are applied to the zdirection.\nIn general, the working principle of a linear polarization converter is that it converts most of the incident wave into the reflected wave with a rotating 90o in polarization (crosspolarization). However, there is an amount of reflected wave that does not change the polarization after the reflection (co-polarization); therefore, cross-reflection (rxy) and coreflection (ryy) coefficients are used to represent the coand cross-polarization reflected components. Assuming that incident EM wave is y-polarized wave with electric field Eiy , then the co- and cross-reflection coefficients are defined as rxy = |Erx|/|Eiy|, and ryy = |Ery|/|Eiy|, where |Erx| and |Ery| are the magnitude of the electric field of the reflected wave components along x- and y-axes, respectively.\nFig. 2(a) shows the simulated amplitude of co- and crosspolarization coefficients of the proposed polarization converter and different phase between them versus frequency from 1 to 10 GHz under transverse electric (TE) mode. We can observe that the rxy is much bigger than ryy in a band from 2 to 8.45 GHz, which confirms most of the incident wave has been converted to its cross-polarized wave after\n2 VOLUME 4, xxxx\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

In order to evaluate the polarization conversion performance of the proposed polarization converter, we use a PCR which is defined from the co- and crossreflection coefficients as Eq. 1 [14].\nPCR = |rxy|2\n|rxy|2 + |ryy|2 (1)\nFig. 2(b) illustrates the simulated PCR of the polarization converter. The simulation is carried out in the band from 2 to 10 GHz with the incident wave coming from the normal direction and under TE mode. We can observe a nearly perfect PCR above 90% is achieved from 2 to 8.45 GHz which fully covers both the S- and C- bands.\nTo understand the working principle of the proposed polarization converter, the simulated amplitude and phase difference of the reflection coefficients are given out as Fig. 3. Assuming that the incident wave is polarized along the y-axis and propagates perpendicular to the top layer of the polarization converter along the z-direction. As shown in 3(a), the incident electric field (Ei) and reflected electric field (Er) of the EM wave can be decomposed into two mutually\nperpendicular components in the uv-coordinate system as Eqs. 2 and 3, respectively.\nEi = Eiu + Eiv (2)\nEr = Eru + Erv = ruuEiu + rvvEiv (3)\nwhere ruu and rvv are the reflected coefficients along the uaxis and v-axis, which can be defined as ruu = |Eru|/|Eiu|, and rvv = |Erv|/|Eiv|. Since a low loss dielectric (tan\u03b4 = 0.025) is used for the polarization converter, the energy loss of the incident EM wave can be neglected; Therefore, the amplitude of ruu and rvv can be assumed to unit (|ruu| = |rvv| = 1). Also, due to the proposed polarization converter is an asymmetrical structure, it can be considered as an anisotropic material with dispersive relative permittivity and permeability results in a phase difference (\u2206\u03c6) between ruu and rvv [27]. Then, we have the relation between ruu and rvv as: rvv = ruu ej\u2206\u03c6. Thus, Eq. 3 can be rewritten as Eq. 4.\nEr = ruuEiu + ruue j\u2206\u03c6Eiv (4)\nWhen |\u2206\u03c6| = 180o + 2k\u03c0 (k is integer), combine Eqs. 3 and 4 we have Eru = ruuEiu and Erv =\u2212ruuEiv . It means that either Eru or Erv is opposite to their corresponded incident direction, leading to the synthetic reflected electric field (Er) is rotated exactly 90o compared to the incidence as depicted in inset of Fig. 3(a).\nTo verify this theoretical analysis, we simulate the magnitude and phase difference of the reflection of u- and vcomponents for the converter under normal incidence. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the co-reflection amplitudes of u- and v-polarized waves, ruu and rvv , are nearly equal 1 in an ultra-wide bandwidth from 2 to 8.45 GHz as we theoretically predicted. Moreover, the cross-reflection coefficient between u- and v-polarizations, ruv and rvu, are nearly zero in the band which confirms no cross-polarization exists at u- and v- polarizations. Fig. 3(b) gives the phase difference \u2206\u03c6 between ruu and rvv over frequency. As shown in Fig. 3b, we get 180o\u221240o\u2264\u2206\u03c6\u2264180o+40o from 2 GHz to 8.45 GHz. The phase difference is equal 180o at 2.16 GHz, 2.98 GHz, 5.0 GHz, and 7.83 GHz which the same with four resonant frequencies of the polarization converter.\nIn additional, to better qualitatively verdict the polarization state of EM wave, ellipticity (\u03b7) and polarization azimuth angle (\u03b8) for the y-polarize and normal incidence also are investigated, which are determined as Eqs. 5 and 6 [28], [29].\n\u03b7 = 1\n2 arcsin\n( 2\u00d7 pr \u00d7 sin (\u2206\u03c6)\n1 + |pr|2\n) (5)\n\u03b8 = 1\n2 arctan\n( 2\u00d7 pr \u00d7 cos (\u2206\u03c6)\n1\u2212 |pr|2\n) (6)\nwhere |pr| = |rxy|/|ryy| and \u2206\u03c6 is the phase difference between rxy and ryy . Theta is the rotation angle of the electric field direction of the reflected wave with respect to\nVOLUME 4, 2022 3\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Nguyen et al.: Ultra-Wideband and Lightweight Electromagnetic Polarization Converter\nthe electric field direction of the incident waves, whereas eta denotes the polarization state of the reflecting wave. When \u03b7 = 0\u25e6, the reflected wave has linear polarization; otherwise, it has another type of polarization. As a result, the ypolarization wave can be transformed into its x-polarization counterpart if \u03b7 = 0o and \u03b8 = \u00b190o. The calculated \u03b8 and \u03b7 are illustrated in Fig. 4 which shows that the ellipticity of the incident y-polarized wave stands less than 18o from 2.0 to 8.45 GHz at the whole frequency band while the polarization azimuth angle keeps nearly 90o or \u221290o in the band.\nMoreover, in order to explore the physical mechanism behind the ultra-wideband polarization conversion behavior of the proposed converter, we simulate the surface current distributions on the metallic pattern (top layer) and the ground plane (bottom layer) at the four resonant frequencies (Fig. 5). As shown in Figs. 5(a), (e) and Figs. 5(b), (f), the surface currents on the top layer are anti-parallel to those on the ground plane at 2.16 GHz and 2.98 GHz. The antiparallel currents together form a loop current in the dielectric layers, which is considered as magnetic resonance [22]. In reversely, the surface currents on the top layer are parallel to those on the ground plane at 5.0 GHz and 7.83 GHz as shown in Figs. 5(c), (g) and Figs. 5(d), (h). The parallel currents on the top and the bottom layers will form an E-field in the substrate layer which indicates the electric resonance occurs\n[30]. Hence, these two higher resonances are originated by electric resonance. Furthermore, two loops of currents (left loop is anticlockwise and right is clockwise) appear in Fig. 5(a) (pink color), while those in Fig. 5(c) are the same just with the reverse loop of current (left loop is clockwise and right is anticlockwise), which typically exhibits the feature of magnetic resonance. However, the excited magnetic fields are created by these loops is antiparallel and therefore cancel each other. Moreover, the currents in two arm of arcs both flow to the up-left (Fig. 5(b)), while the direction of currents are with the opposite direction (Fig. 5(d)), displaying the characteristic of electric resonance. The synthetic electric field is the same direction with the incident electric field at the resonant frequency of 2.98 GHz. It indicates that the magnetic resonance is mainly contributed to this resonant frequency [31]. However, the synthetic electric field is the opposite of the incident electric field at 7.83 GHz (Fig. 5(d)), indicating that the excited electric field is stronger than the incident electric field. This phenomenon proves that an electric resonance is excited at 7.83 GHz [31]. It is can be concluded that the overlap of the four polarization rotation resonances is responsible for the ultra-wideband polarization conversion of the proposed polarization converter.\nTo further investigate the contribution of the airgap layer on the conversion performance of the proposed polarization converter, we simulate the PCR of the converter at different values of the airgap thickness. As shown in Fig. 6, the polarization converter without the airgap shows four separated and narrow peaks in the band from 0 to 12 GHz with a low performance. By introducing the airgap, the PCR level of the peaks are improved significantly. Moreover, the lowest resonances are nearly unchanged when the thickness of the airgap varies from 4 to 14 mm. In contrast, the other resonances move to lower frequency band with the increase in the thickness of airgap forming a wide band PCR spectrum. However, with the airgap above 10 mm, the resonances are too close to each other results in the PCR bandwidth of the proposed polarization converter shrank. The effects of the air-gap thickness on the performance of the proposed polarization converter can be explained by the transmission\n4 VOLUME 4, xxxx\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The equivalent circuit of a unit cell of proposed structure can be illustrated in [32]. The admittance of metallic resonant patch and the admittance of the FR4 dielectric slabs and the airgap are connected in parallel to form the input admittance of the proposed structure. When the imaginary part of the input admittance is equal to zero, resonances can be produced [33]. The size and shape of the resonator patch are also optimized and fixed the its admittance. To meet the lightweight requirement, the thickness of FR-4 substrates are fixed to 0.8 mm. As a result, the resonant frequencies can be adjusted using the thickness of the airgap (k) [32]. Furthermore, an optimized airgap thickness can be found to create the resonances that give the largest impedance matching and yield the widest broadband characteristic. As shown in Fig. 6, the optimum airgap thickness for the designed structure is obtained at k = 10 mm for the best PCR performance.\nIt is also important to explore the effect of incident angles on the proposed converter performance. Fig. 7(a) shows the PCR of the proposed polarization converter versus frequency at different values of the incident angle. The simulated PCR is carried out under the condition that the electric field of the incident wave parallels to the y-axis (y-polarized). As shown in Fig. 7(a), the PCR of the polarization converter slightly decreases when the incident angle changes from the normal direction (0o) to 30o. In general, the PCR of the polarization converter is maintained above 85% in the ultrawideband with the incident angle up to 30o, except a very narrow frequency band at 5 GHz. The falling of the PCR in the narrow band around 5 GHz can be explained mainly due to the destructive interference between the reflected waves at the metasurface [34].\nWe also calculate the average simulated PCR on the working band of 2 to 8.45 GHz under different incident angles using Eq.7:\nPCR(\u03b8) = M\u2211 i=1 PCR(fi) (7)\nwhere PCR(fi) and M are the PCR at discrete frequency points fi and the number of discrete frequency points within the working band, respectively; PCR(\u03b8) is average simulated PCR under incident angle of \u03b8.\nFig. 7(b) shows the average PCR of the polarization converter under TE polarization in the ultra-wideband from 2 GHz to 8.45 GHz as a function of the incident angle. The achieved average PCR of the polarization is higher than 90% with the incident angle up to 30o, and it is still maintained a higher 85% for a wide incident angle up to 38o. This result confirms that the proposed polarization converter exhibits a stable polarization conversion with respect to variations in the incidence angle."

The proposed converter is fabricated which consists of an 11\u00d711 unit-cell that corresponds to the dimensions of 244.2 \u00d7 244.2 mm2. The measurement of the DUT is performed using a vector network analyzer (Rohde and Schwarz ZNB20) associated with two standardgain horn antennas as transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) to determine the reflection coefficients. The DUT is located 0.5 m away from the antennas to satisfy a far-field condition. The measured PCR of the DUT is determined from the coand cross- reflection coefficients as described in Eq. 1. The measurements are taken in the frequency range from 1 to 10 GHz. The detailed description of the measurement setup can be found in [35].\nFig. 9 shows the measurement result at a oblique angle of 10o, which is in a good agreement with the simulation. As shown in Figs. 9(a) and (b), measured magnitude of coand cross-reflection coefficients are above 0.9 and bellow 0.3 in a very wide frequency range from 2 to 8.45 GHz. This result correspond to measured PCR results under transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes are higher than 0.9 in the band. The measurement demonstrates that the proposed polarization converter is a highly efficient linear polarization conversion.\nTable 2 gives a performance comparison to confirm the advantages of the proposed design compared to existing broadband polarization converters which were recently reported in the literature. The comparison is carried out in terms of operating bandwidth with an efficiency above 90%, relative bandwidth, conversion efficiency, total thickness of solid parts, and size of unit cell.

Moreover, in order to judge the light-weight characteristic of converter designs, we give the weight factor (w) which is proportional to thickness excluding air-gap (tsolid) and periodicity of the unit cell (P ) as w \u221d tsolidP 2. For the tsolid, we only consider thickness of the substrate since the metal layer is very thin compare to the subtrate layer. The weight factor of this work is defined as standard (1.0); therefore, the value of the factor below or above 1 indicates a how much the design is lighter- or heavier-weight compare to the proposed polarization converter, respectively. As indicated in Table II, the proposed polarization converter operates at lowest frequency band with highest fractional bandwidth and has the most lightweight design among them.\nIV. CONCLUSION We present an ultra-wideband and high efficiency polarization converter for S- and C- bands applications. By introducing a hollow dielectric layer to a simple metasurface resonator, the polarization converter shows a very lightweight design even working at a relatively low frequency. Firstly, theoretical analysis and simulation are carried out to explain the working mechanism of the polarization converter. Then, the polarization converter is fabricated and the experimental\nresults are carried out with good agreement with the simulation results. The results show that the proposed polarization converter converts linear-polarized incident EM waves into its cross-polarized reflective counterparts with high polarization conversion with a polarization conversion ratio above 90% in an ultrawide frequency range from 2 to 8.45 GHz. This operating frequency band corresponds to a relative bandwidth of 123.4% and entirely covers both the S- and Cbands. Compared with the available broadband designs, the proposed polarization converter shows excellent performance in terms of simple and lightweight design and ultrawide bandwidth. The advantages demonstrate great potential for applications in microwave communications, imaging systems, and remote sensors."
