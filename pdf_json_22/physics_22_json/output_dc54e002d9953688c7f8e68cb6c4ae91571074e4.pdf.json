The higher genus log and open Gromov\u2013Witten invariants associated to a quasi-tame Looijenga pair Y (D) are related as\n(10) Od(Y op(D))( ) =\n\u239b \u239d l\u22121\u220f\nj=1\n(\u22121)d\u00b7Dj\u22121\nd \u00b7Dj\n\u239e \u23a0 (\u22121) d\u00b7Dl\u22121\n[d \u00b7Dl]q N log d (Y (D))( ).\nMoreover,\nLMOVd(Y op(D))( ) = [1]2q\n( l\u220f\ni=1\n1\n[d \u00b7Di]q\n)\n\u00d7 \u2211\nk|d\n(\u22121)d/k\u00b7D+l\u03bc(k)\n[k]2\u2212lq k2\u2212l N log d/k(Y (D))(k )\n\u2208 Z[q, q\u22121] .(11)\nConjecture 1.1 was proved in [7, Thm. 1.4\u20131.6]. Conjecture 1.2 was proved in [7, Thm. 1.5 and 1.7] for tame Y (D), and formulated as a conjecture for quasi-tame Y (D) in [7, Conj. 4.8]. Two non-tame, quasi-tame cases of this conjecture were subsequently proved in [30].\nIn this paper, we establish a stronger statement from which Conjecture 1.2 follows for any quasi-tame Looijenga pair Y (D). We will provide a closed-form calculation and comparison of both sides of (10), returning the two equalities in Conjecture 1.2 as a corollary. Since the tame setting was already dealt with in [7], we may restrict our attention here to non-tame, quasi-tame pairs alone, for which l = 2. We give here a slightly discursive version of the main result of this paper (see Propositions 2.3, 2.5 and 2.7 for precise statements, and e.g. (12) and (14) for explicit formulas).\nTheorem 1.3. Let Y (D) be a non-tame, quasi-tame Looijenga pair Y (D) and d \u2208 H2(Y,Z). The log and open higher genus generating functions N log d (Y (D))( ) and Od(Y\nop(D))( ) are rational functions of q = ei , with zeroes and poles only at q = 0, \u221e, or at roots of unity. Furthermore, Conjecture 1.2 holds."

            "text": "Our task is simplified by a number of circumstances, which reduce Theorem 1.3 to the computation of one single example. As explained in [15] and [7, Prop. 2.2], Y (D) is fully determined by the self-intersections (D21, D 2 2), and when considering specific examples we will shorten notation by writing Y (D21, D 2 2) for Y (D). Let \u03c0 : dPr \u2192 P\n2 be the blow-up of the plane at r \u2265 0 points {P1, . . . , Pr}, and write H := \u03c0 \u2217c1(OP2(1)), Ei := [\u03c0 \u22121(Pi)]. Up to deformation and permutation of D1, D2 and E1, . . . , Er, there is a unique non-tame, quasi-tame pair of maximal Picard number given by Y = dP3 and D1 = H \u2212 E1, D2 = 2H \u2212 E2 \u2212 E3, so that (D 2 1, D 2 2) = (0, 2).\nBy [7, Prop 2.2], any other non-tame, quasi-tame pair Y (D) is the result of a toric contraction \u03c0\u2032 : dP3(0, 2) \u2192 Y (D). Therefore, as we recall in Proposition 2.3 below, the blow-up formulas for log and open invariants [7, Prop. 4.3 and 6.9] imply that it suffices to check that Conjecture 1.2 holds for the single case Y (D) = dP3(0, 2). The l.h.s. of (10) in that case was computed in [7, Sec. 6.3.1] to be\nOd (dP op 3 (0, 2)) = (\u22121) d1+d2+d3 [d1]q d1[d0]q[d1 + d2 + d3 \u2212 d0]q\n[ d3\nd0 \u2212 d1\n]\nq\n\u00d7\n[ d3\nd0 \u2212 d2\n]\nq\n[ d0\nd3\n]\nq\n[ d1 + d2 + d3 \u2212 d0\nd3\n]\nq\n,(12)\nwhere we decomposed d = d0(H \u2212 E1 \u2212 E2 \u2212 E3) + d1E1 + d2E2 + d3E3 in terms of generators {H \u2212 E1 \u2212 E2 \u2212 E3, E1, E2, E3} of H2(dP3,Z), and for non-negative integers n, m we denoted3\n(13) [n]q! :=\nn\u220f\ni=1\n[i]q,\n[ n\nm\n]\nq\n:=\n{ [n]q!\n[m]q! [n\u2212m]q! 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n, 0 otherwise.\nThe first equality (10) in Conjecture 1.2 is then a consequence of the following\nProposition 1.4 (=Propositions 2.5 and 2.7). With the conventions above, we have\nN log d ( dP3(0, 2) ) ( ) =\n[d1]q[d2 + d3]q [d0]q[d1 + d2 + d3 \u2212 d0]q\n[ d3\nd0 \u2212 d1\n]\nq\n[ d3\nd0 \u2212 d2\n]\nq\n\u00d7\n[ d0\nd3\n]\nq\n[ d1 + d2 + d3 \u2212 d0\nd3\n]\nq\n.(14)\nIndeed, comparing (12) with (14) we see that these generating series are related as in (10). The second statement, equation (11), then also follows from Proposition 1.4 combined with the BPS integrality result of [7, Thm. 8.1] for l = 2, whose proof applies identically to this case.\nWe will show Proposition 1.4 in two main steps. We will first construct a toric model for dP3(0, 2) in the sense of [20], and then compute the \u03bbg-log Gromov\u2013Witten invariants (1) from the corresponding quantum scattering diagram and algebra of quantum broken lines [4\u20136, 13, 17, 18, 38, 40]. The lack of tameness is epitomised by the existence of infinite scattering when two quantum walls meet, and the resulting sum over quantum broken lines leads to the intricate-looking multi-variate generalised hypergeometric sum in (19). The second step consists of proving that this sum admits a closedform q-hypergeometric resummation given by (14). To our knowledge, this has not previously appeared in the literature, with the exception of the special cases d3 = d2 = d0 and d3 = d0 = d1 + d2 considered in [30]. To prove it, we first establish a difference equation satisfied by a 1-parameter deformation of (19), and then show inductively that the resulting recursion has a unique closed-form solution compatible with (19) by repeated use of Jackson\u2019s q-analogue of the Pfaff\u2013Saalschu\u0308tz summation for the 3\u03d52hypergeometric function.\n3By [7, Prop. 2.5], the effectiveness of d implies that all arguments of the qbinomial expressions in (12) are non-negative integers."

By [20, Prop. 1.3] such a diagram always exists. We will write \u03c1Di for the generator of the ray in the fan \u03a3 of Y associated to the toric prime divisor which is the push-forward along \u03c0 of the strict transform of Di under \u03d5.\nGiven a toric model \u03c0 : Y\u0303 (D\u0303) \u2192 Y (D) as in (15) we can associate a consistent quantum scattering diagram D to it, which is what we discuss next.\n2.1.2. Quantum scattering and higher genus invariants The scattering diagram D is defined on the lattice NZ \u223c= Z\n2 of integral points of the fan \u03a3 of Y , as follows: assume that \u03c0 is a sequence of blow-ups of distinct smooth points P1, . . . , Ps of D and denote E1, . . . , Es the exceptional divisors in Y\u0303 associated to these blow-ups. Further, write \u03c1j for the primitive generator of the ray associated to the toric prime divisor which Pj is an element of. For each j \u2208 {1, . . . , s} we introduce a wall dj := R\u03c1j decorated with\nwall-crossing functions fdj := 1 + tjz \u2212\u03c1j \u2208 C t1, . . . , ts [NZ]. We will often write z\u03c1 =: xayb if \u03c1 = (a, b). Then D is the unique (up to equivalence) completion of the initial scattering diagram Din := {(dj , fdj )}j\u2208{1,...,s} in the sense of [4, 5, 21, 29]. Such a completion can be found algorithmically by successively adding new rays whenever two walls meet, as we now describe.\nFirst of all, after perturbing the diagram Din we may assume that walls intersect in codimension at least one and that no more than two walls meet in a point. Now suppose two walls d1, d2 intersect. Denote by \u2212\u03c1i a primitive integral direction of di and assume fdi = 1 + ciz\n\u03c1i . For our purpose the relevant scattering processes are:\n\u2022 det(\u03c11, \u03c12) = \u00b11 (simple scattering): the algorithm tells us to add a ray d emanating from the intersection point d1 \u2229 d2 in the direction \u2212\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 decorated with 1 + c1c2z\n\u03c11+\u03c12 . \u2022 det(\u03c11, \u03c12) = \u00b12 (infinite scattering): the algorithm creates three types\nof walls. First, there is a central wall in the direction \u2212\u03c11\u2212\u03c12 decorated with a wall-crossing function whose explicit shape is not of interest in the subsequent analysis and hence omitted. Further \u2013 and most relevant for us later \u2013 one needs to add walls d1, . . . , dn, . . . with slope \u2212(n+ 1)\u03c11 \u2212 n\u03c12 decorated with\n1 + cn+11 c n 2z\n(n+1)\u03c11+n\u03c12\nand last a collection 1d, . . . , nd, . . . of walls respectively having slope \u2212n\u03c11 \u2212 (n+ 1)\u03c12 and decorated with\n1 + cn1 c n+1 2 z n\u03c11+(n+1)\u03c12 .\nAdding new walls to the scattering diagram possibly creates new intersection points. Perturbing the diagram if necessary and repeating the above described process for each newly created intersection point yields a consistent scattering diagram D.\nWe now introduce the final combinatorial object we require for our computation of log Gromov\u2013Witten invariants.

This sum is a polynomial in the variables tj with coefficients in Z[q \u00b1 1 2 ]. It turns out that the definition of CDp;m1,m2(q) is mostly independent of p.\nProposition 2.1. [38, Proposition 2.13 & 2.15] The sum in (18) is finite and as long as p is chosen generic, CDp;m1,m2(q) is independent of the choice of p.\nMoreover, we remark that according to the same proposition [38, Proposition 2.15] CDp;m1,m2(q) enjoys the interpretation as being the constant term in the product of two theta functions.

Birational invariance Suppose now that Y (D) is a 2-component quasi-tame Looijenga pair and \u03c0 : Y \u2032(D\u2032) \u2192 Y (D) is a sequence of interior blow-ups such that Y \u2032(D\u2032) is also quasi-tame. The following compatibility statement explains how the higher genus log-open correspondence interacts with this type of birational transformations.\nProposition 2.3. [7, Prop. 4.3 and 6.9] Let \u03c0 : Y \u2032(D\u2032) \u2192 Y (D) be an interior blow-up, with both Y \u2032(D\u2032) and Y (D) 2-component quasi-tame Looijenga pairs. Then Nlogd (Y (D)) = N log \u03c0\u2217d(Y \u2032(D\u2032)), Od(Y op(D)) = O\u03c0\u2217d(Y\n\u2032 op(D\u2032)) for all d \u2208 H2(Y,Z).\nThe comparison statement of Proposition 2.3 for log invariants is easy to visualise in genus 0, where the invariants N log0,d (Y (D)) are enumerative [39]: since blowing up a point away from the curves does not affect the local geometry, the corresponding counts are invariant, a property also reflected in the broken lines calculations of the scattering diagrams of Section 2.1.2. The corresponding statement for the open invariants is a non-trivial consequence of the invariance of the topological vertex under flops [25, 28].\nBy the classification theorem of nef Looijenga pairs in [7, Prop. 2.2], any non-tame, quasi-tame Looijenga pair Y (D) is obtained up to deformation as a sequence of m \u2265 0 interior blowings-down of dP3(0, 2). It follows from Proposition 2.3 that proving Conjecture 1.2 for Y (D) = dP3(0, 2) implies that the same statement a fortiori holds for any other non-tame, quasi-tame pair (and indeed any 2-component quasi-tame pair with Picard number lower than four)."

            "text": "Let us then specialise to Y (D) = dP3(0, 2). Throughout this section we will write d = d0(H\u2212E1\u2212E2\u2212E3)+ \u22113 i=1 diEi for a curve class d \u2208 H2(dP3,Z). If d \u00b7D1 or d \u00b7D2 vanishes, then N log d ( dP3(0, 2) ) ( ) = 0. In case the intersection numbers are strictly positive, we may use the scattering diagram of dP3(0, 2) to compute the invariants.\n2.2.1. Constructing the toric model First, we recall from [7, Sec. 4.4] the construction of a toric model of P2(D1 \u222a D2), with D1 a line and D2 a smooth conic intersecting D1 in two distinct points P1 and P2. Let E denote the tangent line through P1 to D2. In the following we will always identify D1, D2, E , and some yet to be defined divisors F1, F2 with their strict transforms, resp. push-forwards, under blow-ups, resp. blow-downs.\nBlow up the point P1, and write F1 for the exceptional divisor, and then blow up the intersection point of F1 with D2 and denote the exceptional curve by F2. Under these blow-ups, the strict transform of E is a (\u22121)-curve intersecting F2 in one point and can therefore be blown down. This blowdown results in the log Calabi\u2013Yau surface ( P2(D), D ) with anti-canonical\ndivisor D = D1 \u222aF1 \u222aF2 \u222aD2 where F1 is a curve with self-intersection \u22122, D2 has self-intersection 2, and D1, F2 zero. Therefore, since the irreducible components of D form a necklace with the same self-intersections as the toric boundary of F2, we already must have P2(D) = F2 with D the toric boundary by [15, Lemma 2.10] and hence we have constructed a toric model for P2(D). From the discussion of the previous Section, at a tropical level the fact that we blew down E amounts to adding a wall dF2 emanating from a focus-focus singularity on the ray corresponding to F2 in the fan of F2.\nThe above construction results in a toric model for dP3(0, 2), as displayed in Figure 1: we blow up an interior point on D1 and two interior points onD2 and take the proper transforms, which at the fan level leads to the addition of focus-focus singularities on the rays corresponding to D1 and D2 (indicated with crosses in Figure 1). We denote by E1, resp. by E2, E3 the exceptional loci that result from blowing up a point in D1, resp. two points on D2.\n2.2.2. The quantum scattering diagram We now follow the construction outlined in Section 2.1.2 to derive the quantum scattering diagram D of the toric model of dP3(0, 2) (Figure 2). We shoot out walls dF2 , dD1 , dD2,1, dD2,2 emanating from the focus-focus singularities in the direction \u2212\u03c1, where \u03c1 is the respective generator of the ray in the fan. We send the singularities to infinity and perturb the walls as indicated in Figure 2. From these initial walls we now want to construct a consistent scattering diagram. However, since in our subsequent analysis we will only be interested in walls with slope lying in the cone generated by (0,\u22121) and (1, 2), we will restrict the discussion to such walls only. As |\u03c1F2 \u2227 \u03c1D1 | = 2 there is infinite scattering in the sense of Section 2.1.2 between the walls dF2 and dD1 . This results in walls d2, d3, . . . with slope \u2212n\u03c1F2 \u2212 (n \u2212 1)\u03c1D1 = (1,\u22122(n \u2212 1)) decorated with wallcrossing functions 1 + tntn\u221211 x\n\u22121y2(n\u22121) where n > 1. For conformity, let us write d1 := dF2 . Now for all n \u2265 1 each wall dn intersects both dD2,1\nand dD2,2. Luckily, in this case we only have simple scattering resulting in walls with slope (1,\u22122n+3) and wallcrossing functions 1+tntn\u221211 tix \u22121y2n\u22123 where i \u2208 {2, 3}. Lastly, we notice that the wall which is the result of scattering between dn and dD2,1 intersects dD2,2 thus producing a wall with slope (1,\u22122n + 4) and wallcrossing function 1 + tntn\u221211 t2t3x \u22121y2n+4 attached to it. Let us call this wall dD2,D2n . The whole construction is summarised in Figure 2.\nWe collect the walls constructed above into 4-tuples labelled by an integer n > 0 as depicted in Figure 3. The nth tuple consists of the wall dn, the walls which are the result of scattering between dn and dD2,1, resp. dD2,2, and lastly the wall dD2,D2n+1 .\n2.2.3. Higher genus log GW invariants In this section we will apply Proposition 2.2 to obtain the log Gromov\u2013Witten invariants of dP3(0, 2). For this we need to determine CDp;m1,m2(q), where mi := (d \u00b7 Di)\u03c1Di and p is a generically chosen point. First, let us characterise all quantum broken lines which contribute to this sum.\nLemma 2.4. Choose p in the lower right quadrant so that it lies to the right of dD2,2 and that below p there are only walls belonging to the nth 4-tuple of walls with n \u2265 d \u00b7D2 + 2. Then the following statements hold:\n1. If \u03b22 is a quantum broken line with ends (p,m2) then either it is a straight line and thus m\u03b22,end = m2 or m\u03b22,end lies in the half open cone {\u2212a1\u03c1D1 \u2212 a2\u03c1D2 | a1 > 0, a2 \u2265 0}.\n2. If \u03b21 and \u03b22 are quantum broken lines with ends (p,m1) and (p,m2) respectively such that\nm\u03b21,end +m\u03b22,end = 0\nthen \u03b22 is a straight line and \u03b21 may only bend at walls to the right of dD2,2 as in Figure 2.\nProof. Statement 1. can be proven by a straightforward, but tedious caseby-case analysis. Since this proof is barely enlightening we omit it here, and only explain how 1. implies 2. Indeed, suppose \u03b22 is not a straight line. Then by 1. we must have m\u03b21,end \u2208 {a1\u03c1D1 + a2\u03c1D2 | a1 > 0, a2 \u2265 0}. However, this means that \u03b21 only crosses walls at which it may pick up a contribution that bends it further into the the lower right quadrant. In particular, such a quantum broken line cannot have asymptotic monomial zm1 , leading to a contradiction. Hence, \u03b22 must be a straight line.\nHaving Lemma 2.4 at hand, we are now equipped to determine the log Gromov\u2013Witten invariants of dP3(0, 2) via Proposition 2.2.\nProposition 2.5. Let d be an effective curve class with d \u00b7D1, d \u00b7D2 > 0. Then\nN log d ( dP3(0, 2) ) ( ) =\n\u2211\n\u2200(i,n)\u2208{1,2,3,4}\u00d7Z>0:\nki,n\u22650\nd0= \u2211 n\u22651 \u22114 i=1(n+\u03b4i,1)ki,n\nd1= \u2211 n\u22651 \u22114\ni=1 ki,n d0\u2212d2= \u2211 n\u22651(k1,n+k4,n) d0\u2212d3= \u2211 n\u22651(k1,n+k3,n)\n\u220f\nn\u22651\n2\u220f\ni=1\n[ d2 + d3 \u2212 \u2211 m\u22651 \u22114 j=1(2m\u2212 \u03b4j,3 \u2212 \u03b4j,4)kj,n+m\nki,n\n]\nq\n\u00d7\n[ d2 + d3 \u2212 \u2211 m\u22650 \u22114 j=1(2m+ \u03b4j,1 + \u03b4j,2)kj,n+m\nk2+i,n\n]\nq\n.\n(19)\nProof. In order to compute Nlogd ( dP3(0, 2) ) we choose a point p as specified in Lemma 2.4 and consider quantum broken lines \u03b2i with ends (p, z (d\u00b7Di)\u03c1Di ), where i \u2208 {1, 2}, so that the sum of the exponents of their end-monomials at p vanishes. As stated in Proposition 2.2, we then obtain the desired log Gromov\u2013Witten invariant by taking the product of the two end-coefficients, summing this over all such pairs of quantum broken lines and extracting the coefficient of the monomial td\u00b7\u03d5\u2217E \u220f3 i=1 t d\u00b7\u03d5\u2217Ei i .\nLet us then analyse a quantum broken line \u03b21 coming from the direction D1 with asymptotic monomial z\n(d\u00b7D1)\u03c1D1 = xd1y2d1 ending at p which only bends at walls to the right of dD2,2 as illustrated in Figure 2.

Indeed, suppose that after passing the first (n\u22121) 4-tuples of walls \u03b22 carries the monomial an\u22121x bn\u22121ycn\u22121 . Then crossing wall 4 of the nth 4-tuple displayed in Figure 3 we see that\nby the defining property 3 of a quantum broken line and formula (17) the\nmonomial carried by the quantum broken line must now be\nan\u22121x bn\u22121ycn\u22121 4 \u2212\u2192 an\u22121\n[ (2n\u2212 3)bn\u22121 + cn\u22121\nk4,n\n]\nq\ntnk4,nt (n\u22121)k4,n 1\n\u00d7 t k4,n 2 x bn\u22121\u2212k4,nycn\u22121+(2n\u22123)k4,n(21)\nfor some k4,n \u2265 0.

Now\npicking the coefficient of (29) in (28) we obtain that Nlogd ( dP3(0, 2) ) is the sum of\n\u220f\nn\u22651\n2\u220f\ni=1\n[ d2+d3\u2212 \u2211N\u2212n m=1 ( 2m(k1,n+m+k2,n+m)+(2m\u2212 1)(k3,n+m+k4,n+m) )\nki,n\n]\nq\n\u00d7\n[ d2+d3\u2212 \u2211N\u2212n m=0 ( (2m+ 1)(k1,n+m+k2,n+m) + 2m(k3,n+m+k4,n+m) )\nk2+i,n\n]\nq\n(30)\nover kj,n \u2265 0, j \u2208 {1, . . . , 4} and n \u2208 {1, . . . , N} subject to the conditions (26), (27) and\nd0 =\nN\u2211\nn=1\n( k1,n + n 4\u2211\ni=1\nki,n\n) ,(31)\nd0 \u2212 d1 =\nN\u2211\nn=1\n( k1,n + (n\u2212 1) 4\u2211\ni=1\nki,n\n) ,(32)\nd0 \u2212 d2 =\nN\u2211\nn=1\n(k1,n + k4,n) ,(33)\nd0 \u2212 d3 =\nN\u2211\nn=1\n(k1,n + k3,n) .(34)\nNotice here that (31), (33), and (34) together imply (27), and that (32) follows from subtracting (26) from (31). Hence, it is sufficient to impose conditions (26), (31), (33), and (34) only. Note that these constraints are exactly the ones appearing in the sum in (19). Moreover, (30) exactly matches the summand on the right-hand side of (19) and hence the claimed formula is proven.\nRemark 2.6. It is easy to convince oneself that there are actually only finitely many summands contributing to (19), due to the finite number of choices (ki,n) satisfying the summation conditions. Moreover, the product in each of these summands is well-defined since the first sum condition forces ki,n = 0 for all n > d0. Thus, only a finite number of binomials can be different from one and therefore the whole expression becomes well-defined.\nTo prove that the right-hand side of (19) returns (14), it will be helpful to consider a 1-parameter deformation of (19), as follows. For non-negative integers a, b, c, d, e, we write\nG(a, b, c, d, e) :=\n\u2211\n\u2200(i,n)\u2208{1,2,3,4}\u00d7Z>0: ki,n\u22650 a= \u2211 n\u22651 \u22114 i=1(n+\u03b4i,1)ki,n\nb= \u2211\nn\u22651 \u22114 i=1 ki,n\nc= \u2211\nn\u22651(k1,n+k4,n)\nd= \u2211\nn\u22651(k1,n+k3,n)\n\u220f\nn\u22651\n2\u220f\ni=1\n[ e\u2212 \u2211 m\u22651 \u22114 j=1(2m\u2212 \u03b4j,3 \u2212 \u03b4j,4)kj,n+m\nki,n\n]\nq\n\u00d7\n[ e\u2212 \u2211 m\u22650 \u22114 j=1(2m+ \u03b4j,1 + \u03b4j,2)kj,n+m\nk2+i,n\n]\nq\n.\n(35)\nBy (19), our sought-for log Gromov\u2013Witten generating function is ob-\ntained from (35) via the restriction\n(36) Nlogd ( dP3(0, 2) ) = G(d0, d1, d0 \u2212 d2, d0 \u2212 d3, d2 + d3) .\nWe claim that (35) has a simple closed-form summation, as follows.\nProposition 2.7.

The proof is composed of three main steps:\n1. We first establish (37) for the base cases a = 0 and b = 0 by a direct\nanalysis of the quantum broken line sum in (35), which in these cases is either vanishing, or reduces to a single summand (Lemma 2.8). 2. We then establish, for a, b > 0, a difference equation satisfied by\nG(a, b, c, d, e) in the parameters a, b, c and d. This equation recursively and uniquely determines G(a, b, c, d, e) from the knowledge of the base case G(a\u2032, b\u2032, c\u2032, d\u2032, e) with 0 \u2264 a\u2032 < a (Lemma 2.9). 3. We finally check that the r.h.s. of (37) is also a solution of the difference\nequation, and conclude by uniqueness (Proposition 2.11). The proof is fundamentally based on a classical q-hypergeometric summation result in the form of the q-Pfaff\u2013Saalschu\u0308tz formula (Lemma 2.10).\n2.2.4. Proof of Proposition 2.7 We start by considering the base cases a = 0 and b = 0 in the induction procedure.\nLemma 2.8. We have that\n(39) G(0, b, c, d, e) = \u03b4b,0\u03b4c,0\u03b4d,0 , G(a, 0, c, d, e) = \u03b4a,0\u03b4c,0\u03b4d,0 ."

In this case the r.h.s. of (35) is equal to one for c = d = 0, while if either c = 0 or d = 0 it vanishes being an empty sum.\nTo see that (39) agrees with (37), note that when a = 0 the second summand in (37) must always vanish, while the first one is non-zero only if b = c = d = 0, in which case it is equal to 1. Likewise, when b = 0, the right-hand side of (37) can only be non-zero if c = d = 0: this is equal to 1 for a = 0 by the previous analysis, and for a > 0 the contributions from the two summands cancel each other, since\n[ e\u2212 a\n\u2212c\n]\nq\n[ c\u2212 a+ d+ e\nc\n]\nq\n[ a\u2212 c\nd\n]\nq\n[ a\u2212 d\n\u2212d\n]\nq\n\u2212\n[ e\u2212 a\u2212 1\n\u2212c\n]\nq\n[ c\u2212 a+ d+ e\u2212 1\nc\n]\nq\n[ a\u2212 c\u2212 1\nd\n]\nq\n[ a\u2212 d\u2212 1\n\u2212d\n]\nq\n= \u03b4c,0 \u03b4d,0 \u2212 \u03b4c,0 \u03b4d,0 = 0 .\nLemma 2.9.

Collecting the factorials depending on k3 and k4 in the resulting expression, we get\n[a\u2212 b]q! [a\u2212 c\u2212 d]q! [b\u2212 2a+ c+ d+ e]q! 2\n[b\u2212 a+ e]q!

[d\u2212 a+ e]q! .\nThe above is exactly the expansion of G\u0303(a, b, c, d, e) into factorials, proving (45).\nUsing Proposition 2.11 we can conclude the proof of Proposition 2.7.\nProof of Proposition 2.7. By (40), for a > 0 and b > 0, G(a, b, c, d, e) is determined by the value of G(a\u2032, b\u2032, c\u2032, d\u2032, e) for 0 \u2264 a < a\u2032. This means that G(a, b, c, d, e) is the unique solution of (40) compatible with the boundary value in (39) for G(0, b, c, d, e). By the second part of Lemma 2.8, the r.h.s. of (37) indeed returns the correct value of G(0, b, c, d, e) and G(a, 0, c, d, e) from (35), so all that is left to do is to check that it solves (40), and conclude by uniqueness.\nTo this aim, it is sufficient to argue using Proposition 2.11: note first of all that the coefficients of the recursion are invariant under the shift\n(a, e) \u2192 (a\u2212 1, e\u2212 2). Therefore, since G\u0303(a, b, c, d, e) is a solution of (40) by Proposition 2.11, then so is G\u0303(a\u2212 1, b, c, d, e\u2212 2). Furthermore, since (40) is linear in G, their difference is also a solution. But by (43) this is exactly the claimed expression for G(a, b, c, d, e) in (37), which concludes the proof.\nCorollary 2.12. Conjecture 1.2 holds for any quasi-tame pair Y (D).\nProof. The tame case having been treated in [7], it suffices to restrict to nontame, quasi-tame pairs. Taking the specialisation (36) of (37) leads to (14), which together with (12) establishes the first equality of Conjecture 1.2 for Y (D) = dP3(0, 2). Since Od (dP op 3 (0, 2)) = Od (dP op 3 (1, 1)) [7, Sec. 6.3.1], the BPS integrality statement in the second equality further follows without any modification from the proof of [7, Thm. 8.1] for l = 2. Finally, since every non-tame, quasi-tame pair Y (D) is related to dP3(0, 2) by a series of m \u2265 0 iterated interior blow-ups at general points of D [7, Prop. 2.2], Proposition 2.3 further implies that Conjecture 1.2 holds for any such pair."
