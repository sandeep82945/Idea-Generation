For each Transitions2050 scenario, we distributed the mobility demand for walking, cycling and 25 e-cycling across age groups. Relying on the health impact assessment framework, we quantified the 26 impacts of the corresponding physical activity on all-cause mortality. The impact of each of the 27 carbon neutrality scenarios was determined by comparison with estimates from the BAU scenario. 28 Results: In S1 and S2 scenarios, volumes of active transportation are projected to increase to fulfil 29 the World Health Organisations recommendations by 2050, while they increase slightly in S3 and 30 decrease in S4. S2 scenario reaches the highest levels of health cobenefits, with 497,000 deaths 31 prevented between 2021 and 2050. This would translate into a life expectancy gain of 3.0 months for 32 the general population in 2050, mainly driven by e-bikes. S1 would provide smaller but important 33 health benefits, while these benefits would be modest for S3. On the contrary, S4 implies 52,000 34 additional deaths as compared to the BAU scenario, and a loss of 0.2 month in life expectancy. 35 .

Discussion: Different ways to decarbonize mobility in a net-zero perspective may achieve very 36 contrasting public health cobenefits. This study illustrates how the public health dimension may 37 provide a relevant insight in choices of collective transformation toward net-zero societies. 38 Introduction 39 40 The Paris agreement, adopted in 2015, establish the objective of constraining the rise in average 41 global temperature to 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels (UNFCCC (United nations Framework 42 Convention on Climate Change ), 21st session 2015). To achieve this, a substantial reduction of 43% 43 in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 is necessary (IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 44 Change) 2023). The sixth report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 45 highlights the importance of numerous actions that effectively reduce our carbon footprint while 46 concurrently promoting human health. These health co-benefits manifest across several dimensions 47 such as diet, transport, energy supply or green and blue infrastructures (IPCC (Intergovernmental 48 Panel on Climate Change) 2023). 49 The transport sector accounted for approximately 15% of anthropogenic GHG globally in 2019 (IPCC 50 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2023). In France, it contributes up to 31% of GHG 51 emissions (HCC (The High Council on Climate) 2021). Amongst the many existing levers to limit these 52 emissions (electrification of the energy supply, increased vehicle occupancy, lower transport 53 demand...), some have the potential to yield health co-benefits. Among those, shifting to active 54 modes of transportation offers the additional advantage of mainly relying on local decisions such as 55 reallocation of existing infrastructures and land use planning (Stappers et al. 2023). 56 Active transportation encompasses essential daily activities (e.g., commuting to work, visiting the 57 doctor, shopping) as well as leisure activities (e.g., cultural outings, sports) and has indeed been 58 identified as a lever for achieving socio-economic, air quality, and public health co-benefits (IPCC 59 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2023). However, physical activity levels worldwide 60 have failed to meet international recommendations, affecting both adolescents and adults (Guthold 61 et al. 2018). In high-income countries, 9.3% of overall mortality can be attributed to physical 62 inactivity (Katzmarzyk et al. 2021). Insufficient physical activity also incurs substantial monetary costs 63 for public and private healthcare systems and households while leading to decreased productivity 64 (Ding et al. 2016). A 2017 study focusing on urban populations estimated that meeting international 65 guidelines on physical activity, air pollution, noise, heat, and access to green spaces could prevent 66 20% of deaths. Among these factors, physical activity yielded the largest proportion of preventable 67 deaths (Mueller et al. 2017). 68 The health benefits associated with active transportation may be substantiated by various health 69 impact assessment methods that consider diverse parameters, regardless of the geographical 70 context (Mueller et al. 2015). Institutions and organisations have devised prospective pathways 71 outlining the necessary transformations required for the societies to attain the objectives of the Paris 72 agreement. Numerous studies quantify the health impacts of active commuting in prospective 73 scenarios, with a majority conducted in Europe, North America or Oceania, primarily focusing on 74 urban areas (Mueller et al. 2015; Rojas-Rueda et al. 2016). Nevertheless, to the best of our 75 knowledge, only one study has been conducted at the national level in France, quantifying the 76 impacts of a single scenario compared to the baseline levels of 2021 (Barban et al. 2022). 77 .

Each of these scenarios is 84 designed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in metropolitan France following distinct trajectories 85 corresponding to different societal choices (Figure 1) (The French Agency for Ecological Transition). 86 Additionally, a business-as-usual scenario (BAU) was formulated, representing a projection of our 87 current lifestyle trends until 2050, without achieving carbon neutrality.

This allocation was done in order to achieve two objectives: 124 i) replicate the observed 6.7-year age difference between E-bikers and cyclists as reported in a recent 125 multi-country study (Castro et al. 2019), and ii) reflect the changing relative contribution of E-bikes to 126 the total cycling distance over time, as assumed in each scenario. 127\nFurther details regarding these calculations are provided in the Supplementary Materials. 128\n129\nDemographic projections 130\nPopulation projections, including mortality and life expectancy, for different years and age groups, 131 were accessed from publicly available data provided by the French national institute of statistics and 132 economic studies (INSEE). These same data were also used by ADEME in the design of all their 133 transition scenarios. 134\n135\nHealth impact assessment 136\nWe relied on international guidelines to model and report the health effects associated with active 137\ntransportation of the Transitions2050 scenarios for metropolitan France over the 2021-2050 period 138\n(Hess et al. 2020). 139\nFor each age group, yearly distances travelled were converted into exposure times for walking, 140\ncycling or E-cycling using the following average speeds, respectively: 4.8, 14.9 and 18.1 km.h -1 141\n(Egiguren et al. 2021; G\u00f6tschi et al. 2020). First, we compared the resulting total duration of active 142\ntravel to international recommendations for weekly moderate physical activity, averaged over the 143\nentire adult population. 144\n145\nThe health impacts (number of deaths averted) generated by physical activity associated with active 146 transportation were calculated, using a linear dose-response function between duration spent in 147 active transportation and the reduction in all-cause mortality, weighted by the specific mortality rate 148 and size of the population: 149\n, 1 ,\nWith: 150\n, : Number of death prevented 151 : Relative risk of all-cause mortality associated with the reference duration of active travel 152 (Kelly et al. 2014). 153\n.

This correspond to an energy expenditure of 11.25 156\nMET.hour.week -1 . 157\nMRa : Specific mortality rate of an age categorie a 158\nPOPa : Population of the age category a 159\nWe used a relative risk (RRREF) of 0.89 for all-cause mortality when engaging weekly in 168 minutes of 160 walking, with maximum risk reduction of 30%, and a relative risk of 0.90 for 100 minutes of cycling, 161 with a maximum risk reduction of 45%. Health impacts are therefore capped above 460 minutes of 162 walking and 447 minutes of cycling (Kelly et al. 2014). We constrained the benefits associated with 163 physical activity to the population aged between 20 and 89 years. This restriction was made based on 164 the fact that the relative risk estimates for cycling and walking were extrapolated from studies 165 encompassing individuals within the age range of 20 to 93 years (Kelly et al. 2014) and the data used 166 for age distribution of cycling distances were collected from individuals aged between 15 and 89 167 years (Ministry of Ecological Transition). The assumed ratio of energy expenditure between E-bikes 168 and bikes was 0.90, as recently used by studies conducted at European and international city levels 169 (Egiguren et al. 2021). The impacts were evaluated for each age group, taking into account the 170 respective population size and mortality rate. The total count of deaths prevented by each scenario 171 was obtained, together with the number of years of life lost (YLL) prevented, by subtracting from the 172 estimated number of deaths prevented in this scenario the estimated number of deaths prevented in 173 the BAU scenario. Finally, based on the estimate of the number of deaths prevented, life tables were 174 generated in order to compute the life expectancy in each scenario. 175\nMonetizing the health impacts 176\nWe further estimated the intangible costs associated with the health impact of each scenario, using 177 the value of a statistical life year (VSLY) that is recommended in France for the socioeconomic 178 assessment of public investments (Emile 2013). In France, the VSLY is projected to be \u20ac151,000 in 179 2025, and this figure is anticipated to increase to \u20ac202,000 by 2050. 180\nThe VSLY was multiplied by the number of YLL prevented to calculate the monetary impacts of 181 mortality risk reduction. All monetarized values were expressed in \u20ac2022. 182\nAll the estimates were presented alongside uncertainty intervals (UI), which were determined using 183 the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the RR used. 184\nSensitivity analyses 185\nWe performed five distinct sensitivity analyses. First, we explored a more favourable RR associated 186 with cycling (0.81 instead of 0.90 per 100 minutes of cycling), as estimated by a recent meta-analysis 187 (Zhao et al. 2021). Second, we explored alternative walking and cycling speeds, respectively 3.6 and 188 13 km.h-1 (The French Agency for Ecological Transition). Third, we investigated an alternative ratio of 189 0.78 between E-bike and cycling energy expenditures (Berntsen et al. 2017). Fourth, for scenarios S1 190 and S2, we assumed that the high increase of cycling overall would affect the demography of cyclist 191 toward a flatter age distribution, as those observed in countries with a high cycling culture, such as 192 Denmark. We therefore evolved gradually between 2021 to 2035 the distribution of age-specific 193 contribution of kilometres cycled from the levels observed in France (Ministry of Ecological 194 Transition) to those reported in Denmark (Center for Transport Analytics, Transport) (see 195\n.

Lastly, we constrained the benefits of active transportation to the age 196 range of 20 to 75 years, as opposed to the wider scope of 20 to 89 years in the main analysis.

In 2015, the active transportation levels in the French 207 population allowed for a weekly average of 80 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical 208 activity (The French Agency for Ecological Transition). In the S2 scenario, in 2035, the average levels 209 of physical activity through active transportation alone are expected to attain the minimal WHO 210 recommendations. The S1 scenario nearly achieves these levels by 2035 and surpasses them by 2050. 211 In contrast, the S3 scenario falls short of reaching the minimal recommended levels of physical 212 activity, both in the medium term (2035) and the long term (2050). Both the BAU scenario and the S4 213 scenario project minimal increases in active transportation compared to 2015, and fail to reach 214 WHO\u2019s minimal recommendations, even by 2050. These results are detailed by age groups in 215 supplementary materials (Figure S2). 216\n217\nFigure 2 - Duration (averaged for the 20-89 years old) of physical activity generated by active 218 transportation in 2035 and 2050 compared to the French levels in 2015 (all estimated by ADEME 219 Transition scenarios) and the WHO guidelines for moderate physical activity [26]. 220\n.

The disparities in health impacts among scenarios 225 become more pronounced as time progresses. From 2030 to 2040, the benefits of S1 and S2 226 scenarios experience a large increase, while the benefits of S3 scenario show a more linear 227 progression. On the other hand, S4 scenario has negative impacts that intensify over time and remain 228 noticeable for all age groups above 50 years old. Deaths prevented by scenarios S1-S3 are highest in 229 the 80-89 age group, and YLL prevented increase for younger ages, plateau for the 40-59 and the 60-230 79 years old age groups, and are limited amongst 80-89 years old. 231\nFor all age groups, the benefits of S2 surpass all other scenarios while the benefits of S1 outweigh 232 those of S3. The YLL metric makes these benefits apparent for younger age groups (from 20 years old 233 on). The health impacts of S4 remain small, though negative. 234\n235\nFigure 3 - Deaths prevented (A and C) and YLL prevented (B and D) by year (A and B) and age group (C 236 and D, cumulative for the 2021-2050 period) for each transition scenario compared to the BAU. 237\n.

Overall, the parameter choice which 271 affects the most our estimates is the RR value for cycling. Assuming a more favourable RR leads to 272 notable increases in the YLL estimated, around +50 to +70%. Modifying the speeds of walking and 273 cycling has less but substantial effects of about +20% in the YLL prevented. By lowering the speeds, 274 the duration of exposure to physical activity is extended, leading to higher health impacts. The third 275 sensitivity analysis, focusing on the ratio of energy expenditure provided by an E-bike compared to a 276 mechanical one slightly reduces the health impact, by less than 10% of YLL prevented. In scenarios 277 characterized by high levels of cycling (S1 and S2), using the gradual shape of the age distribution of 278\ncycling kilometres of France in 2021 to Denmark in 2035 (and on to 2050) leads to a minor decrease 279 in the number of prevented YLL. Considering Denmark\u2019s relative age contribution for cycling 280 kilometres leads to less deaths prevented in older age groups (Supplementary materials, figure S5), 281 and so has limited impacts on YLL prevented. Restricting the health effects to individuals below the 282 age of 75 reduces the YLL prevented ascribed to active transportation by about 20%. 283\n.

Future pathways 297 promoting modal shift to active modes of transportation facilitate the attainment of the minimal 298 recommendation on physical activity set by the WHO solely through transport activities. Conversely, 299 policies wagering on future technological developments to attain carbon neutrality are likely to 300 intensify the lack of physical activity and its harmful health impacts in the general population. 301 According to the extent of modal shift, and compared to the BAU, health impacts at the 2035 horizon 302 may range from 19,000 deaths prevented to 2,000 additional deaths, representing respectively \u20ac34 303 billion annual savings and \u20ac3 billion additional mortality costs. Qualitative results and the ranking of 304 Transitions2050 scenarios remained consistent through several sensitivity analyses. 305\nLiterature comparison 306 For all scenarios, the majority of health benefits may be explained by an achievable increase in 307 cycling mobility, particularly through the use of E-bikes. The most optimistic scenario reaches 20 308 kilometres cycled and 7 kilometres walked per person weekly, representing roughly 20 minutes per 309 day of active transportation. Such increase in active transportation seem considerable as compared 310 to the levels reported before 2020. However, they remain lower to those reported in other European 311 countries: In Netherlands, active transportation represent between 24 and 28 minutes daily (Fishman 312 et al. 2015) and more than 50% of trips <2 kilometres and 30% of trips between 2 to 5 kilometres are 313 undertaken using bicycles (Goel et al. 2021). This highlights the margin of progression for active 314 transportation in France, where only 5% of the active population uses a bike for trips covering less 315 than 5 kilometres, while 60% opt for a car (Chantal Brutel, Jeanne Pages 2021). The anticipated levels 316 of active transportation in S1 and S2 scenarios therefore appear to be quite achievable. 317\nThe method we used for quantifying health and economic impacts follows the recommended steps 318 and parameters outlined by the WHO and environmental economists. These approaches are widely 319 described and employed in various scientific studies (Emile 2013; G\u00f6tschi et al. 2020; Smith et al. 320 2021). A health impact assessment study on the transport sector was previously conducted in France 321 using a similar method (Barban et al. 2022). The scenario explored in this study projected active 322 transportation levels similar to those observed in the S1 scenario, and the estimated health impacts 323 were similar to those we obtain. Studies comparing multiple scenarios consistently demonstrate 324 significant differences in the health impacts of active transportation: Climate policy strategies that 325 prioritize health-promoting pathways and are built upon the behaviours of the population yield more 326 significant health benefits (Hamilton et al. 2021; Milner et al. 2023). 327\nPreventing, as we predict in scenario S2, 19,000 deaths annually by 2035 solely through deliberate 328 decisions in the development of the transportation sector holds significant importance for public 329 health prevention as it corresponds to 2.8% of all-cause mortality projected for this year (INSEE). 330 Indeed, in comparison, in France, it is estimated that exposure to PM2.5 is responsible for 40,000 331 deaths annually (Sant\u00e9 publique France 2021) while heat-attributable deaths reached up to 7,000 in 332 2022 (Sant\u00e9 publique France 2023). In the transport sector, all road-related fatalities in France range 333 between 3,000 and 4,000 deaths annually (excepted in 2020 and 2021) (ONISR (Observatoire 334 national interminist\u00e9riel de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re) 2023). From a benefit-cost perspective, based on a 335 UK case-study, the economic gain of prevented mortality generated by an additional 267 regular 336 cyclists per kilometres of a new separated cycleway breaks even on the costs of construction (Candio 337 and Frew 2023). 338\n.

However, it is important to acknowledge that electric 340 vehicles, along with the high battery metals demand (European Federation for Transport and 341 Environment 2023), can also contribute to pollutant emissions through the dispersion of road dust 342 particles and the degradation of tires and brakes wear (Bourliva et al. 2017). In the transport sector, 343 modal shift and decarbonation of the energy supply can yield larger health co-benefits (Milner et al. 344 2023). The promotion of E-bikes is a cost-effective approach to reduce transport associated carbon 345 emissions while improving health and mobility (Jenkins et al. 2022). The allocation of more areas to 346 bicycle infrastructure can also optimize the utilization of public space (G\u00f6ssling et al. 2016). 347\nOther outcomes have to be taken into account when outlining health effects of modal shift such as 348 air pollution, road injuries or noise. Regardless of the specific assumptions, the health benefits of 349 active transportation consistently outweigh the potential adverse effects stemming from exposure to 350 air pollution and traffic-related incidents (Mueller et al. 2018). Among various modes of 351 transportation, car users exhibit highest levels of exposure to air pollutants such as PM2.5, black 352 carbon, and CO (de Nazelle et al. 2017). The association with road injuries depends greatly on the 353 assumptions made on the fatality and injury rates of cyclists (Quam et al. 2017) as well as the quality 354 of transport infrastructures (WHO 2022). Furthermore, each incremental shift from cars to bicycles 355 corresponds to a noteworthy decrease in pollutant emissions (Bernard et al. 2021). For instance, it 356 has been estimated that an individual who replaces one car trip per day with a bicycle trip over 200 357 days can reduce their CO2 emissions by 0.5 tons per year (Brand et al. 2021). Noise pollution would 358 also benefit from modal shift, which would yield positive impacts on health-related quality of life, 359 mediated by annoyance and sleep disturbance (H\u00e9ritier et al. 2014). It is also expected that a general 360 increase of physical activity reduces morbidity related to cardiovascular risks, cancer, osteoporosis, 361 depression and low back pain (Miller et al. 2016). Further impacts related to quality of life can also 362 benefit from active transportation such as work performance and productivity (Ding et al. 2016). 363\n364\nLimitation 365 Using the transport demand as a proxy for physical activity allows for a quantification of health 366 impacts associated with specific active modes of transport but does not encompass several variations 367 in the population. For example, given the expectation that scenarios S3 and S4 would limit active 368 transportation primarily to those who are already physically active, while scenarios S1 and S2 would 369 promote active transportation for a broader population, including individuals who are sedentary, a 370 more targeted distribution of transport demand could be achieved. This distribution would involve a 371 heterogeneous allocation of distances within age groups. By implementing such an allocation 372 strategy, the differences in health impacts between high cycling (S1, S2) and low cycling (S3, S4) 373 scenarios could be amplified. Another limitation linked to this proxy is that the physical activities 374 performed out of transport context are not taken into account, despite their anticipated distinct 375 evolution across scenarios. However, several studies suggest that active transportation adds to 376 rather than replaces other physical activities (Laeremans et al. 2017). 377\nUsing a relative risk from a meta-analysis provides a robust association between physical activity and 378 mortality reduction but does not allow to specify distinct relative benefits based on age, gender, or 379 socio-occupational category. A recent meta-analysis showed no significant differences in the 380 association of cycling with all-cause mortality for gender groups and among individuals aged above or 381 below 50 years (Zhao et al. 2021). Additional cohort studies are needed to assess the potential 382 heterogeneity of the association between more specific age groups and socio-occupational 383 categories. 384\n.

Higher modal shift scenarios lead to an accelerated reduction in 387 air pollution exposure, while evidence shows a non-linear relationship between the number of 388 cyclists and road injuries (Jacobsen et al. 2015). Using the same dose-response function across years 389 may lead to underestimating health benefits and narrowing the differences between scenarios. 390\nOur results are calculated from a projected scenario, the BAU. This inherent uncertainty may 391 introduce variability in the absolute results of each scenario, yet it does not alter the relative 392 hierarchy of their respective impacts. 393\nAll in all, it is important to acknowledge that a health impact assessment study only provides 394 theoretical estimates of health and economic impacts, and that its quantitative results should not be 395 over-interpreted. However, the magnitude of effects and the comparison of scenarios allow for a 396 better interpretation of the co-benefits and potential implications of specific public policies. 397\n398\n399\nConclusion 400 Different carbon neutral trajectories imply distinct health benefits, this holds particularly true within 401 the transport sector. The implementation of public policies promoting modal shift effectively 402 improves population health while reducing the use of fossil fuels and pollutant emissions. In France, 403 directing transportation towards active modes would yield significant health co-benefits. Transition 404 trajectories primarily relying on technological interventions offer minimal benefits and may even 405 exacerbate the lack of physical activity in the population. In a context of reaching towards carbon 406 neutrality, these results may help guide decision-makers in the choice of optimal transition 407 strategies. 408\n409\nAcknowledgments 410 We are thankfull to Stephane Barbusse (ADEME - The French Agency for Ecological Transition) for 411 useful elements and discussions regarding the ADEME Transitions2050 scenarios. 412\n413\nAuthors contributions 414 PQ and KJ conceived the design of this study.
