Cons. p.A, Reggio Emilia, Italy, 4 Dipartimento di Scienze della Vita e Biotecnologie, Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi Di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy\nIntroduction: Today, alternative strategies based on the use of bioactive compounds have been proposed to reduce mycotoxin contamination and limit the use of chemical fungicides.\nMethods: In the present work, several by-products collected from the agrifood chain (i.e., red and white grape marc, red grapevine leaves, grape seeds and stalks, pear, apple, green beans, tomato, and spent hops) were subjected to green extraction protocols (i.e., steam distillation, Ultrasound-Assisted, and Naviglio\u00ae extraction) to obtain extracts rich in polyphenols and terpenes. Each extract was assessed in vitro for its ability to inhibit the development of the main mycotoxigenic species and related mycotoxins.\nResults and Discussion: Aspergillus flavus and A. carbonarius were significantly reduced by pear (from \u221245 to \u221247%) and grape marc (from \u221221 to \u221251%) extracts, while F. graminearum was shown to be highly influenced by grape stalk, pear, and grape marc extracts (\u221224% on average). On the contrary, F. verticillioides was inhibited only by pear (\u221218%) and to a very low and negligible extent by apple (\u22121%) and green beans (\u22123%). Regarding the reduction of mycotoxins, the extracts were able to inhibit OTA from 2 to 57%, AFB1 from 5 to 75%, and DON from 14 to 72%. The highest percentages of reduction were obtained against FBs (from 11 to 94%), ZEN (from 17 to 100%), and Alternaria toxins (from 7 to 96%). In conclusion, this work provided promising results for the production of bioactive extracts obtained from agri-food by-products, which could be exploited as potential biofungicides against the development of mycotoxigenic fungi and related mycotoxins.\nKEYWORDS\nfood waste, plant extract, aflatoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, Alternaria toxins"

            "text": "The presence of mycotoxins in food commodities is a concrete risk worldwide, with important potential impacts on human and animal health; therefore, their presence in agricultural products is the subject of extensive research across the globe. Cereals, dried fruits, and spices may be\u00a0exposed to contamination by several mycotoxigenic fungal species and related mycotoxins (1\u20135). Moreover, in a climate change scenario where high temperatures and extreme events such as floods or droughts are reached, the development of mycotoxigenic fungi could find suitable environmental conditions for their easy growth. The European Union (EU) has established maximum levels for the major mycotoxins (6, 7). Recently, the European Commission also published maximum levels for Claviceps ergot and a recommendation for Alternaria toxins in food products, underscoring the increasing concern about the possible effects of these mycotoxins on human health (8, 9).\nPreventive methods, such as good agricultural practices and the use of appropriate chemical products, are considered the best choices to reduce mycotoxin contamination. However, the increasing interest of consumers in the adverse health effects presumably produced by pesticides has led to a growing demand for natural products, as their use is seen as an improvement in food quality and consumer safety. Due to the increasing need to reduce the use of chemical pesticides in agriculture, also according to the guidelines of the EU Green Deal, and to achieve both the environmental emergency and the consumer demand for safer agro-food products, several bioactive compounds showed to be\u00a0promising alternatives as inhibitors of antifungal activity and mycotoxin production.\nIn in vitro studies, phenolic compounds, which are naturally found in plants, herbs, fruits, and other vegetables, showed antifungal activity and could limit mycotoxin production (10\u201312). Polyphenols were able to inhibit trichothecene-producing Fusarium (13), isoflavones showed weak inhibitory activity against Fusarium graminearum (14), and several essential oils were efficient in mitigating mycotoxigenic Aspergillus and Penicillium species (15, 16). In general, naturally occurring phenolic compounds and terpenes seem to be\u00a0 really effective as anti-mycotoxin agents. Food waste represents a reservoir of these bioactive compounds, and their valorization through appropriate biorefinery approaches could play a crucial role in sustainable and zero-waste global development. In fact, today, the residual biomass discarded by the whole food chain amounts to 1,300 Mtons/year, with a significant impact on the ecosystem. For this reason, the circular economy is now being explored as a new economic system that allows the reuse and valorization of waste and by-products as a resource to manufacture new materials and products. In this perspective, food waste extracts could be\u00a0 a potential source of bioactive polyphenols that can be\u00a0 exploited for many different purposes (e.g., food additives, preservatives, coloring agents, and nutraceuticals) (17). Besides their common application as antioxidants and antimicrobials, they could also be\u00a0used as biofungicides and inhibit mycotoxin production in different raw commodities (18). The by-products considered come from three different agri-food supply chains (wine, canning, and brewing) in the Emilia Romagna region, where the two collaborating universities for this study are located. The most abundant by-products of the wine and canning supply chains were considered: marc, stalks,\ngrape seeds, and leaves from the wine supply chain; and pear, apple, green bean, and tomato processing waste from the canning supply chain. In the case of the brewing chain, the spent hops were considered for their essential oil content and anti-fungal activity.\nMany different methodologies can be\u00a0 used for bioactive compounds, ranging from conventional ones such as acid and alkaline hydrolysis, solvent extraction, and Soxhlet extraction to more sustainable and new techniques that are more cost-effective and highly efficient (19). The extraction techniques used for this study (Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction, Naviglio\u00ae, and steam distillation) were chosen based on secondary metabolites with possible antifungal activity against the microorganisms able to be\u00a0obtained and also for their low environmental impact. The first two, carried out with hydroalcoholic solvents, were necessary for the extraction of polar molecules, while steam distillation, the method of choice for obtaining essential oils (also listed in the Official European Pharmacopoeia for numerous drugs), was used to obtain hop essential oil.\nUsing these extraction processes, different agri-food wastes have been exploited for their biological, biostatic, and biocidal activities and have been considered for their possible use as alternatives to protect plants from contamination by fungi and mycotoxins, limiting the use of chemical fungicides."

            "text": "A total of 14 different extracts were obtained from 10 different food by-products using the different high-tech methodologies described previously. Extracts obtained using Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (UAE) and pressurized liquid extraction with Naviglio\u00ae technology (NAV) were primarily analyzed for the content of polyphenolic compounds (Table\u00a02).\nThe extraction methods used for the production of extracts allowed yields ranging from 9.32% in VIN to 37.92% in GB. Red grape marc, white grape marc, and grapevine leaves were extracted using both NAV and UAE techniques, with UAE providing the highest extract yields. These extracts were also subjected to chemical analysis in order to quantify the content of total phenols, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidins. Total phenolic compounds ranged from 17.56 g gallic acid equivalent/100 g dried extract in TO to 514.26 g gallic acid equivalent/100 g dried extract in VIN. As previously reported, for those samples that were subjected to both UAE and NAV extraction techniques, UAE allowed the recovery of the highest amount of phenolic compounds. Total flavonoids were determined in concentrations ranging from 3.88 g of hyperoside/100 g dried extract in AP to 126.41 g of hyperoside/100 g dried extract in RGL NAV; the highest amount of total proanthocyanidins was detected in VIN extract (92.17 g cyanidin chloride/100 g dried extract), while the lowest was TO (0.58 g cyanidin chloride /100 g dried extract). Comparing these results, it can be\u00a0observed that, while UAE gave a higher extraction yield and a higher quantity of total phenolic content than NAV, the quantification of total flavonoids shows the opposite trend, explaining a possible selectivity of this technique towards the latter molecular category. The first eight extracts in Table\u00a02 came from waste from the wine supply chain and showed a higher amount of total phenols compared to the other by-products selected in the current study. In particular, among all the extracts, grape seed UAE was characterized by the highest content of total phenols (514.26 g gallic acid equivalent /100 g dry extract), composed of 18% proanthocyanidins and 12% flavonoids. This matrix, although of high commercial value, showed the lowest extractive yield compared to the other agri-food extracts obtained. Considering the quantification of total flavonoids, RGL extracted using the NAV technique was the richest waste matrix among those analyzed, showing twice the flavonoid content of grape seeds. The flavonoid fraction of this matrix was then studied in detail, and individual flavonoids were identified and quantified. Table\u00a03 shows the results of the flavonoid quantification of the leaf extract.\nTABLE\u00a02 Yield and total phenolic compounds (TPC), flavonoids (TFC), and proanthocyanidins (TPrC) content in agri-food extracts.\nExtract (Abbreviation) Yield % TPC (g GAE/100 g dried extract)\nTFC (g Hyp/100 g dried extract)\nTPrC (g Cyanidin Chloride/100 g dried\nextract)\nRed Grape marc UAE (RG UAE) 23.26 \u00b1 0.30 259.20 \u00b1 8.47 13.59 \u00b1 1.10 89.70 \u00b1 5.44\nRed Grape marc NAV (RG NAV) 11.29 \u00b1 0.64 205.59 \u00b1 7.75 21.88 \u00b1 1.32 61.76 \u00b1 6.72\nWhite Grape marc UAE (WG UAE) 30.55 \u00b1 0.71 197.26 \u00b1 5.32 4.40 \u00b1 0.24 31.36 \u00b1 1.38\nWhite Grape marc NAV (WG NAV) 14.26 \u00b1 0.92 165.43 \u00b1 20.73 10.85 \u00b1 1.28 33.50 \u00b1 3.21\nRed Grapevine Leaves (RGL UAE) 15.27 \u00b1 0.72 253.19 \u00b1 11.41 113.48 \u00b1 3.24 10.02 \u00b1 0.18\nRed Grapevine Leaves (RGL NAV) 11.75 \u00b1 0.84 148.21 \u00b1 1.10 126.41 \u00b1 10.25 3.54 \u00b1 0.18\nGrape seeds UAE (VIN) 9.32 \u00b1 0.48 514.26 \u00b1 5.70 60.56 \u00b1 3.51 92.17 \u00b1 7.10\nGrape stalks UAE (GS) 31.72 \u00b1 0.54 198.95 \u00b1 10.40 22.24 \u00b1 0.51 9.14 \u00b1 0.09\nPear (PE) 24.34 \u00b1 0.22 105.94 \u00b1 9.84 17.96 \u00b1 1.25 3.56 \u00b1 0.11\nApple (AP) 34.07 \u00b1 2.33 29.50 \u00b1 1.53 3.88 \u00b1 0.33 0.80 \u00b1 0.08\nGreen Bean (GB) 37.92 \u00b1 1.83 41.17 \u00b1 1.11 8.99 \u00b1 0.63 0.96 \u00b1 0.03\nTomato (TO) 15.97 \u00b1 0.82 17.56 \u00b1 0.55 7.33 \u00b1 2.06 0.58 \u00b1 0.04\nSpent Hops UAE (HW) 22.83 \u00b1 0.03 18.84 \u00b1 0.32 15.06 \u00b1 1.33 1.26 \u00b1 0.02\nTPC, total phenolic content; TFC, total flavonoid content; TPrC, total proanthocyanidin content; GAE, gallic acid equivalent; Hyp, hyperoside.\nFrontiers in Nutrition 05 frontiersin.org\nIn this case, too, the NAV technique gave the best quantitative results, highlighting the main flavonoids as quercetin and kaempferol derivates.\nAnother molecular category of interest from the point of view of reducing fungal growth is anthocyanins (33); a preliminary quantification was carried out in the red pomace extracts (Table\u00a04).\nNAV and UAE did not significantly influence the concentration of anthocyanins detected in the RG extracts, and oenin was the most abundant in both samples.\nMoreover, chlorogenic acid, known for its antifungal action (34), was determined in AP and PE extracts since it is one of the main secondary metabolites identified in these vegetables. Pear processing residues obtained with UAE showed a chlorogenic acid content of 2.54 \u00b1 0.21 mg/g of extract, while apple processing residues obtained with UAE showed 0.70 \u00b1 0.03 mg/g of extract.\nFinally, the HW extract (from the IPA mixture after brewing) was obtained by hydro-distillation and characterized for its terpene content by GC\u2013MS and GC-FID analysis (Table\u00a05).\nThe extraction yield of the exhausted hop (Hop-EO) after IPA brewing was 0.10%, and the most abundant terpenes were: myrcene (29.1%), \u03b1-caryophyllene (29.1%), \u03b2-caryophyllene (13.9%), cadinene (5.0%), and humulene epoxide (2.5%)."

In particular, A. flavus and A. alternata were the fungi inhibited by the highest (n = 9) and the lowest (n = 1) number of extracts, respectively (Table\u00a06). In general, the growth of the Aspergillus species considered in this study (A. flavus and A. carbonarius) was more affected by PE (reductions from 45 to 47%) and RG-WG (reductions from 21 to 51%) extracts, but also TO (\u221224%) and GS (reductions from 27 to 33%) extracts, which proved to be\u00a0good inhibitors for these fungi\u2019s development. For Aspergillus species, differences were found for AP and GB extracts; in fact, in both cases, A. carbonarius was more affected by their presence (reduction of 23 and 28%, respectively) (Figure\u00a01) when compared with A. flavus (reduction of 8 and 10%, respectively) (Figure\u00a02).\nAmong the Fusarium species considered in this study, more differences in fungal susceptibility were found. While F. graminearum was shown to be\u00a0highly affected in its development by several extracts (GS, PE, and RG-WG) (Figure\u00a03), F. verticillioides was only inhibited by PE (\u221218%) and to a very low and negligible extent by AP (\u22121%) and GB (\u22123%) (Figure\u00a04).\nAlternaria alternata was less affected by the presence of extracts, resulting in a slight reduction only with GB (\u22125.8%) (Figure\u00a05).\nInterestingly, some extracts were effective against more fungi. In particular, PE extract was one of the most effective against A. flavus, A. carbonarius, F. verticillioides, and F. graminearum, causing significantly lower development in the considered fungi (p \u2264 0.01) (Figures\u00a01\u20134). Marcs from both red and white grapes can significantly reduce fungal development in all fungi considered, with the sole exception of A. alternata and F. verticillioides (p \u2264 0.01) (Figures\u00a01\u20133)."

In particular, with RG-WG obtained from NAV, regardless of the grape color, ZEN was completely inhibited, while DON was increased more than 100 times. The same happened with RG obtained from UAE and with PE extracts.\nTaking into consideration only the significant differences in mycotoxin production highlighted by ANOVA, species-dependent results were obtained.\nRegarding OTA, although good reductions were obtained with several extracts (GS, PE, RG, and RGL UAE), only the essential oil of spent hops was shown to induce a significant reduction in mycotoxin production (p \u2264 0.05); on the contrary, AP and VIN induced an increase in OTA production (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure\u00a01).\nMore extracts were able to reduce the production of AFB1 by A. flavus.

Considering DON produced by F. graminearum, a significant reduction in mycotoxin production was obtained only by WG UAE (\u221272%) (p \u2264 0.05), but good reductions were also obtained by TO and AP extracts, with 60 and 30% less production, respectively, although not significant from a statistical point of view (Figure\u00a03).\nRegarding ZEN, the other mycotoxin produced by F. graminearum, all the RG-WG and PE extracts were the most effective in its reduction (\u2212100%) (p \u2264 0.01); satisfactory results were also obtained using HW-UAE (\u221297%) (Figure\u00a04).\nFor FB, more extracts were able to significantly reduce the mycotoxins. The most effective were WG and DON, but in this case, they were extracted by NAV and PE extracts with reductions higher than 80% (p \u2264 0.01) (Figure\u00a0 5). The production of FBs by F. verticillioides was, however, significantly reduced by approximately 70% when GS and WG were extracted by UAE (p \u2264 0.01) (Figure\u00a05).\nFor Alternaria toxins, it is difficult to highlight some extracts that are able to contrast all the mycotoxins considered in the same way. In many cases, we\u00a0observed a significant reduction for some Alternaria toxins and, at the same time, a high production for others among those considered. Taking into account TeA, often the most abundant in cereals, the most significant reductions were obtained with HWextracted UAE (\u221242.8%) and with VIN extract (\u221250.3%) (p \u2264 0.01) (Figure\u00a06). For the other mycotoxins considered, the best results were obtained instead by WG, both NAV, and UAE, for AOH (about \u221282%)\n(p \u2264 0.01) and by GB (\u221294.4%) and WG-NAV (\u221295.9%) for AME (p \u2264 0.01) (Figure\u00a0 7). Although not statistically significant for all Alternaria toxins considered, GB, VIN, RGL-UAE, and HW-UAE extracts were able to reduce all three toxins to different extents (Figure\u00a07)."

            "text": "The different results obtained by the different agri-food waste extracts tested in this work were probably due to their varying chemical compositions. Several published studies reported the antifungal activities of pure chemical compounds; some of them also showed interesting results against mycotoxigenic fungi. Compounds belonging to the terpene and benzaldehyde classes showed reducing activities against aflatoxin-producing Aspergillus species: o-vanillin damaged the mitochondria of A. flavus (35, 36), and some essential oils (cinnamaldehyde, thymol, citral, and carvacrol) inhibited A. flavus growth and AFB1 production (37). In addition, several organic acids (such as benzoic acid, butyric acid, sorbic acid, hop \u03b1- and \u03b2-acids, and phenolic acids), flavonoids, and naphthoquinones have also been shown to reduce A. flavus growth and AFB1 production (11, 38\u201341).\nIn our study, a systemic approach was used to evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of 14 different agri-food waste extracts against multiple mycotoxigenic fungi and related mycotoxins. In particular, the agri-food waste extracts that showed the highest reductions against Aspergillus and aflatoxins were hop essential oil,\nFIGURE\u00a01 Mean development (mm) and ochratoxin A production (OTA, ng) of A. carbonarius grown on Petri dishes (\u00d8 90 mm) with potato dextrose agar and 1 ml of different extracts obtained from agricultural production waste at a concentration of 1,000 mg/L after 14 days of incubation at 25\u00b0C. Different letters mean significant differences according to Tukey\u2019s test; blue letters refer to significant differences between the theses related to fungal growth, while orange letters refer to significant differences between the theses related to mycotoxin production.\nFrontiers in Nutrition 09 frontiersin.org\nrich in terpenes, red grape leaves, and pear extract, rich in flavonoids and phenolic acids.\nRegarding toxigenic Fusarium species, isoflavonoids, and phenolic compounds showed activities against F. graminearum (14) and trichothecene (13). Green bean extract, containing isoflavonoids such as genistein and daidzein, was able to significantly reduce DON, FBs, and ZEA; pear, white, and red grape extracts, rich in phenolic compounds, reduced FBs production.\nFinally, the reduction of OTA by RG-NAV extract can be\u00a0supported by the inhibition of flavonoids on A. carbonarius and OTA reported by Ricelli et\u00a0al. (42).\nIt is always very important to consider the different effects that the use of extracts may have on fungal growth and mycotoxin production, which are not always correlated. It is possible to observe how the same extract can reduce fungal development but may not be\u00a0effective on mycotoxins, and vice versa. This is quite normal for mycotoxigenic fungi because of their specific nature. In fact, it is well known that stress conditions, such as those caused by restrictions in development due to fungicides, can induce a higher production of mycotoxins by the same fungus (43\u201345), even if with scarce growth. On the other hand, mycotoxigenic fungi developing in environments without stress conditions can grow very much and quickly without the necessity to produce mycotoxins (46, 47). Considering extracts, they can have a possible effect on fungal behavior, since they are composed of substances naturally present in the plant substrates attacked by fungi and that can be\u00a0used, in some cases, as nutritional compounds by some\nspecies. For this reason, if extracts are to be\u00a0 used as possible biofungicides, it is important to study their species-specific effects, since for some fungal species they can boost their development (but at the same time create less stress and thus lower mycotoxin content), and for other fungal species the same extract may limit their growth (but at the same time increase mycotoxin content). Our study confirms the findings reported in previous works that evaluated the antifungal properties of some agri-food waste. Spent coffee grounds showed detoxification for AFBs and OTA (11); lemon peel extract, rich in flavonoids, reduced aflatoxin toxicity in rats (48); olive mill wastewater, produced during olive oil extraction, was shown to suppress AFB1 produced by A. flavus, although no inhibition against fungi was determined (49); apple pomace extracts, rich in phloridzin and quercetin derivatives, showed inhibitory properties against F. oxysporum and N. fischeri (50). Moreover, application as nano-emulsion or micro-capsulation improved the efficacy of food waste extracts; Faouk et\u00a0 al. (51) reported that nano-emulsion of ginger essential oil through an edible coating increased its bioactivity, achieving higher inhibition of A. flavus and related AFB production. Finally, Badr et\u00a0al. (52) proposed the use of encapsulated grape by-products (stems and leaves) as bio-preservatives in foods; their utilization provided relevant OTA reduction.\nHowever, fewer encouraging results were obtained with some extracts that promoted the growth and production of fungi and related mycotoxins. The PE and WG-NAV extracts, even if they inhibited the growth of F. graminearum and the production of ZEN, promoted the\nFIGURE\u00a02 Mean development (mm) and aflatoxin B1 production (AFB1, ng) of A. flavus grown on Petri dishes (\u00d8 90 mm) with potato dextrose agar and 1 ml of different extracts obtained from agricultural production waste at a concentration of 1,000 mg/L after 14 days of incubation at 25\u00b0C.

In addition, OTA was promoted by AP and VIN extracts, with percentages that exceeded 100%."

            "text": "Large amounts of waste and by-products are generated along the whole food chain, which, before being discarded, could be\u00a0significantly valorized as they represent a source of bioactive compounds. In the present work, high-tech extraction processes with high sustainability were applied to a wide range of organic by-products produced in the agro-food sector in order to obtain extracts rich in polyphenols and terpenes. These extracts demonstrated to be\u00a0a valuable tool for the in vitro inhibition of some of the most important mycotoxigenic fungi and related mycotoxins. These extracts could be\u00a0applied in the field or during food storage to reduce the mycotoxin contamination of raw materials to regulatory limits. This could significantly reduce the use of chemical pesticides, which are largely used today, with cascading positive effects on the environment, biodiversity, and human health."
