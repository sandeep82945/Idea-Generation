    "abstractText": "Anti-cancer therapy by iron chelation has been shown to inhibit many cellular processes including DNA replication, mitochondrial metabolism and oncogenic signalling pathways (e.g., EGFR). Iron chelator SK4 represents a double pronged approach towards treating cancer. SK4 enters through LAT1, a commonly overexpressed amino acid transporter in tumours, thus targeting iron addiction and LAT1 overexpression. The aim of this study was to characterise the mode of action of SK4 through proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and seahorse real-time analysis in ovarian cell line SKOV3 and triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA MB 231. Pathway enrichment of proteomics data showed an overrepresentation of metabolism related pathways. Metabolic change after SK4 exposure have been confirmed in investigations of changes in basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration using seahorse real-time analysis of mitochondrial metabolism. Metabolomics also showed an increase in AMP and glucose-1-phosphate. Interestingly, our lipidomics data show a decrease in phospholipid synthesis in the SKOV3 cells which is in contrast with previous data which showed an upregulation of ceramide driven apoptosis. In summary, our data highlight impairment of energy metabolism as a mechanism of action underlying SK4 apoptosis, but also suggest a potential role of ceramide induction in the phenotypic outcome of the cell model.",

            "text": "Iron chelators are a class of anti-cancer therapy which target the dependency of cancer on iron for growth and proliferation [1]. Several mechanisms have been proposed to underly iron chelator cytotoxicity. Iron chelation blocks cell cycle progression through stimulating and inhibiting the expression or function of cell cycle related proteins (e.g., ribonucleotide reductase which is the rate limiting step of DNA synthesis) [2]. Iron chelation has been shown to induce many forms of cell death including apoptosis and autophagy [1,3]. Another proposed target of iron chelation is NDRG1, a tumour suppressor capable of inhibiting EGFR, wnt/\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signalling [4\u20136]. Overall, the clear pattern is multiple targets that could potentially be working in concert to induce cytotoxicity. Although iron chelation has been shown to be effective when tested in vitro and in vivo, this success has not been achieved in clinical trials. The iron chelator Triapine, for example, can induce BRCAness in BRCA wildtype cells and is a more potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase than hydroxyurea [7,8]. However, when taken forward for clinical trials, Triapine had a short-lived patient response indicating potential resistance [9]. This highlights the necessity of designing novel iron chelators with improved targeting of cancer cells.\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 2073. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11072073 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 2073 2 of 13\nSK4 is a novel iron chelator designed and synthesised within our group. SK4 is composed of two key moieties; a moiety responsible for iron chelation and a moiety responsible for entry through LAT1\u2014an amino acid transporter which is commonly overexpressed in cancer cells [10]. Initial work within our group showed that SK4 drove a loss of cell viability and subsequent apoptosis in an in vitro model for melanoma which was found to be dependent on ceramides [10]. This led to further investigation utilising a more extensive panel of cell lines which demonstrated SK4 was effective against a range of cell lines including p53 mutant cell lines (e.g., prostate PC3 cells) and in triple negative breast cancer cell lines (e.g., breast MDA MB 231 cells). Interestingly, a differential response to SK4 was observed in breast MDA MB 231 cells compared to ovarian SKOV3 cells. The MDA MB 231 cell line underwent apoptosis, whereas the SKOV3 cell line did not and, whilst both cell lines displayed S phase arrest, it remained until 72 h in the MDA MB 231 cells but reverted to normal cell cycle distribution at 48 h in the SKOV3 cells [11]. The main aim of this paper was to further analyse the mode of action of SK4 using a multiomics approach of proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics to establish a clearer understanding of the impact of iron chelation on cellular pathways and potential limitations. Iron is known to be a cofactor of many crucial enzymes including ribonucleotide reductase and iron can influence gene expression through binding to IRP1/2. Additionally, the metallome is poorly characterised so iron may also have some unknown functions within cancer cells; thus, we hypothesise iron chelation treatment could have many targets."

SKOV3 cells did not display apoptosis and cell cycle analysis showed S phase arrest at 24 h which returned to normal cell cycle distribution at 48 h. MDA MB 231 cells displayed apoptosis and S phase arrest which was retained at 72 h. To determine if the differences in response were due to differences in pathway induction or repression, proteomics analysis was utilised. MDA MB 231 and SKOV3 cells were treated with their appropriate dosage of SK4 (MDA MB 231 = 31 \u00b5M, SKOV3 = 146 \u00b5M). Differential expression of treated versus untreated cells yielded a list of 372 differentially expressed proteins in the MDA MB 231 cell line (p < 0.05) and 31 proteins with an adjusted p value < 0.05 (see Table S1). In the SKOV3 cell line, 458 proteins were differentially expressed (p < 0.05) with no proteins displaying an adjusted p value < 0.05 (See Table S2).

The addition of SK4 to the cell for 24 h prior to measuring the mitochondrial respiration resulted in a significant decrease in ATP-linked respiration in both SKOV3 and MDA MB 231 cells, highlighting that SK4 pre-treatment leads to lower production of mitochondrial ATP (Supplementary Figure S1). Furthermore, the addition of FCCP in the Seahorse XFp Mitostress assay allows the measurement of mitochondrial maximum rate of respiration that the cell can achieve. In both cell lines, SK4 exposure for 24 h prior to analysis produced a reduction in the maximal respiration, with SKOV 3 cells achieving a statistically significant reduction in maximal respiration. Furthermore, because basal respiration, observed by the OCR remaining in cells after oligomycin addition (Figure 4 panel A), has not increased in either cell line, there is no evidence of a compensatory increase in glycolysis in SK4 treated cells within 24 h.\nFigure 4.

            "text": "Overall, the data show energy metabolism is downregulated by SK4 treatment in both the breast cancer MDA MB 231 and ovarian cancer SKOV3 cell lines. Iron deprivation can lead to abnormal mitochondrial biogenesis with dysfunctional cristae [16,17]. Iron deficiency can inhibit the expression of mitochondrial genes at the post transcriptional level through the IRP1/IRP2 proteins. In iron deficient conditions, IRP1 prevents the translation of Bcl-xL inducing mitophagy [18]. Additionally, iron chelation can inhibit the gene expression of mitochondrial proteins (Sdha, Cycs, Atp5a1, Uqcrc2, Ndufa9, Ndufs8)\nepigenetically through downregulating histone acetylation at H3K9ac [19].\nInterestingly, energy metabolism inhibition does no lead t the same pheno ypic\noutco e; in our previo s study, only the MDA MB 231 cell line underw nt apoptos s but\nnot the SKOV3 c ll line [11]. This could indicate differential r lianc on mitochondrial\nmetabolism in each cell line, and potentially, that the MDA MB 231 cell line could be more\nreliant on mitochondrial metabolism; however, this would need further testing to confirm.\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 2073 11 of 13\nThe iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) has been shown to inhibit the TCA cycle; however, this resulted in a shift to glycolysis, which may promote resistance over time [20]. We have also shown in real-time measurement assays that SK4 lowers basal and maximal respiration and decreases ATP-coupled respiration. Therefore, SK4 has an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial metabolism. As a measure of energy metabolism impairment, mTOR activity could be assessed to confirm our findings with SK4. Metabolomics demonstrated an increase in glucose-1-phosphate which could mark an initiation of the shift to glycolysis in the SKOV3 cells. Iron chelation has been shown to upregulate hif-1\u03b1 which would upregulate GLUT transporter gene expression [21]. This supports a potential case for combining glycolysis inhibitors with iron chelators. Moreover, an upregulation of LAT1 amino acid substrates was observed. LAT1 is an antiport so if there is an increase in intracellular amino acids it may be due to an efflux in SK4, which presents as a limitation towards utilisation of LAT1 as a route of drug entry [22]. LAT1 has been suggested to be a promising target for cancer therapy owing to its relatively higher levels of expression in tumour versus the normal paired tissue [23]. LAT1 overexpressing tumours tend to be more malignant and capable of metastasizing [24]. Previous work showed SK4 can compete with L-phenylalanine (LAT1 substrate) for LAT1 entry; however, this does not negate the potential efflux of SK4 over time [25]. In addition to energy metabolism aberrations, SK4 has also produced significant changes in the lipidome in the SKOV3 cell line. Our data showed a lack of ceramide induction in response to SK4 treatment which contrasts with previous data in the A375 cells [15]. The A375 cells underwent apoptosis, but the SKOV3 cell did not, which could indicate significant ceramide induction is essential for SK4 mediated apoptosis; however, this would need further investigation with more cell lines for confirmation as it is not sufficient to predict the response of other cell lines. In summary, we have used multiple omics techniques to elucidate the mechanism of action behind SK4 cytotoxicity. Our data demonstrate mitochondrial metabolism as a potential target for SK4 in the MDA MB 231 and SKOV3 cells. However, this may lead to a shift in utilisation of glycolysis as a potential resistance mechanism which would need to be investigated further. Potentially, SK4 could be combined with glycolysis inhibitors. Additionally, our lipidomics work demonstrates differential responses in the SKOV3 ovarian cancer compared to the melanoma cell line A375 with SKOV3 displaying a downregulation in the ceramide induction pathway.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/biomedicines11072073/s1, Figure S1.
