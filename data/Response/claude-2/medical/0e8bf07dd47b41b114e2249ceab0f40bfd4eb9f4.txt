 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Compare additional CNN models for brain tumor classification on the augmented dataset. The paper only looked at AlexNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. Trying other architectures like VGG, DenseNet, etc. could lead to even better performance.

2. Explore different augmentation techniques and parameters. The paper used a basic set of augmentations like rotation, flipping, etc. Trying more advanced augmentations like elastic deformations, mixing images, generative models, etc. could further expand the dataset.

3. Combine multiple CNN models into an ensemble. Rather than just using a single model, training multiple models and combining their predictions could improve robustness and accuracy.

4. Apply the models to additional MRI datasets. The models were only tested on one dataset of 233 patients. Validating on other diverse MRI datasets would further demonstrate generalizability. 

5. Investigate model interpretation and feature importance. Methods like saliency maps, occlusion analysis, or LIME could provide insight into what features are most important for the CNN models to make predictions. This could improve understanding of the models.
