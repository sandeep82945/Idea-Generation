            "text": "Special education1 facilitates knowledge and skills acquisition for learners with disabilities. The work of special education teachers (SETs) is marked by individualized attention (Billingsley, 2004), where teachers must constantly strategize for the accommodation of learners with disabilities (Marfo et al., 2020). The competencies of SETs play a critical role in ensuring that learners receive quality teaching (Fauth et al., 2019), regardless of the type and nature of their disability (Allam and Martin, 2021). In African countries, where large inequalities exist, teachers face many challenges: a lack of teacher training, expertise and teaching materials, large class sizes, constraints on teacher time, and a lack of support (Chitiyo, 2006; Zemba and Chipindi, 2020). These contextual factors affect the work engagement (Murangi and Bailey, 2022) and retention of teachers (Billingsley, 2004; Thornton et al., 2007; Vittek, 2015). Research by Conley and You (2017) showed that one-third of novice SETs in the United States quit within the first 3 years of employment.\nDisengagement and attrition of SETs are influenced by various factors within the teachers, the school setting, and the job (Major, 2012; Peyton et al., 2021). The job demandsresources (JD-R) model (Demerouti et al., 2001) has been developed to explain the work-related experiences of employees in terms of the balance between job demands and resources. High demands and a lack of resources contribute to SETs\u2019 disengagement and decisions to leave (Conley and You, 2017). However, as Van der Klink et al. (2016) argue, individuals are more sustainably employable if their work is intrinsically valuable and does not only represent a way to earn a living. Therefore, deliberating values in the workplace and their enablement and achievement (i.e., capabilities) rather than an exclusive focus on employees\u2019 subjective wellbeing is essential. A good balance between demands and resources is not enough for employees to function optimally; they also need a good balance regarding the values they consider relevant to their work (Van der Klink, 2019). The capability approach offers an appropriate framework that links teacher functionings (e.g., work engagement and intention to leave) to their capabilities (in terms of values, enablement, and achievement), job demands and resources, and conversion factors (Van der Klink et al., 2016).\nThe capability approach (CA; Sen, 1985), which was used to conceptualize the sustainable employability (SE) model (Van der Klink et al., 2016), integrates resources, context, and\n1 Given three educational options for learners with disabilities in Namibia, the term special education teacher is used in this study to refer to teachers who deliver quality education to learners with disabilities in special (resource), special classes in mainstream schools, and inclusive schools (see Republic of Namibia, Ministry of Education, 2018).\nvalues to explain employees\u2019 functionings. The SE model postulates that it is important to identify what people value in their work and if they can realize these valued aspects of work to support their sustainable employability (Van der Klink, 2019). Consequently, this model represents a shift in the thinking in occupational health psychology given its inclusion of ethical values (Van der Klink, 2019; Rothmann and Cooper, 2022).\nBakker et al. (2007, 2008) found that job resources (which balance high job demands) are good predictors of teachers\u2019 work engagement, while high job demands, coupled with low job resources, lead to strain on employee wellbeing. Moreover, Bakker et al. (2003) showed that teachers who lack resources withdraw from work, which manifests as low motivation and commitment. Furthermore, Jackson et al. (2006), Janik and Rothmann (2015) confirmed that job demands and resources predict work-related functionings of teachers in South Africa and Namibia, respectively.\nThis study aimed to investigate the effects of job demands and resources on capabilities and functionings as conceptualized in the SE framework (see Van der Klink et al., 2016). Indeed, Billingsley and Bettini (2019) found that only a third of the studies on the retention of SETs used a conceptual framework to inform their research. Moreover, a metaanalytic review of longitudinal studies (Lessener et al., 2019) concluded that the JD-R model provided an excellent theoretical foundation for assessing employee wellbeing. However, research gaps exist regarding the capabilities of SETs and their association with job demands and resources and functionings (such as work engagement and intention to leave)."

            "text": "Functionings, capability, and agency are three key elements of the CA (Sen, 1988; Van der Klink et al., 2016). Functionings are a person\u2019s beings and doings (i.e., states and activities). A person\u2019s capabilities are the combinations of the functionings the person is able and enabled to achieve (Robeyns, 2017), considering resources and conversion factors (Van der Klink et al., 2016). The notion of agency pertains to the possibility of shaping one\u2019s life and context and achieving valuable outcomes (Sen, 1988; Nussbaum, 2011). According to the CA, work should create value for employees and their place of work (Van der Klink et al., 2016), emphasizing what employees are effectively able to do or to be (their capabilities). Capabilities require individual freedom and agency to choose from a set of options about what constitutes a valuable life based on what is valuable to the individual employee (Walker and Unterhalter, 2007; Van der Klink et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nfpsyg-13-942923 October 8, 2022 Time: 15:11 # 3\nMurangi et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.942923\nThe SE model (Van der Klink et al., 2016) emphasizes that, in addition to what employees value, it is essential to know whether they are able and enabled to achieve what they value. Capability for work refers to having the freedom to perform work that one values (Le\u00dfmann and Bonvin, 2011; Van der Klink, 2019). Employees\u2019 sustainable employability becomes at risk when they cannot derive what they consider valuable from their work. According to Robeyns (2017), capability refers to a person\u2019s ability or potential to achieve a functioning, i.e., the beings and doings that he or she values.\nIt is crucial to identify the capabilities of people (opportunities to achieve specific values, being able, and being enabled) in order to create a capability set for work Abma et al. (2016) argue that the capability set for work consists of seven non-ranked work values: using knowledge and skills, developing knowledge and skills, involvement in important decisions, meaningful contacts at work, setting own goals, earning a good income, and contributing to something valuable. These values can become capabilities if SETs find them important in their work, are enabled by contextual factors to achieve these values, and can achieve these values (Abma et al., 2016).\nDeveloping capabilities requires resources and personal and social conversion factors (Robeyns, 2017). According to Le\u00dfmann and Bonvin (2011), job resources for work capability relate mainly to income and work conditions. However, capability for work also depends on personal and social conversion factors (Van der Klink et al., 2016). Personal conversion factors are skills and competencies. Social conversion factors comprise the number of available jobs, the accessibility to applicants, and job quality. The interdependence of resources and conversion factors makes it impossible to categorize them as resources or conversion factors (Le\u00dfmann and Bonvin, 2011). A person\u2019s capability to convert available resources into valued capabilities is crucial since capabilities result from interactions between resources and conversion factors."

            "heading": "The job-demands-resources model",
            "text": "Various job design and job stress theories have emphasized the role of either job demands or job resources in determining employees\u2019 psychological states at work. The JD-R model investigates job demands and resources simultaneously (Demerouti et al., 2001), suggesting that job demands and resources are two sets of work conditions common to all jobs, regardless of the industry or occupation. The JD-R model examines how a lack of personal resources and imbalances between resources and job demands affect employee wellbeing (Lessener et al., 2019; Gabriel and Aguinis, 2022). According to Schaufeli and Taris (2014), there is no single JD-R model.\nRather, the JD-R model represents an approach to how job characteristics (and personal characteristics) can affect workers\u2019 wellbeing.\nJob demands are \u201cphysical, social, or organizational aspects of the job that require sustained physical or mental effort and are therefore associated with certain physiological and psychological costs\u201d (Demerouti et al., 2001, p. 501). For example, emotionally draining interactions or an intense workload and a high pace of work, emotional and physical pressure in work, role ambiguity, and role conflict associated with continuous changes in work are examples of job demands (Billingsley, 2004; Bakker, 2011; Minnotte, 2016). Job resources refer to those aspects of a job that are physically, psychologically, socially, or organizationally important for achieving work goals, reducing physical and psychological strain and stress, and stimulating personal growth and development (Bakker, 2011). For example, job autonomy, learning opportunities, supervisor support, remuneration, role clarity, and feedback are job resources (Rothmann et al., 2013; Minnotte, 2016; Lessener et al., 2019).\nJob characteristics are a vital resource in the JD-R model. Although various job characteristics are regarded as job resources, autonomy and learning opportunities are critical (Rothmann et al., 2006; Gabriel and Aguinis, 2022). A job that provides employees with autonomy allows them to make their own decisions and control the tasks suited to their strengths and interests. Learning opportunities include projects or tasks (on and off the job) focused on developing employee skills. Employees with a broader skillset are more likely to manage and deal with job demands.\nTo optimize employees\u2019 potential, supervisors must uncover the resources they need. For example, a supervisor may show concern for the wellbeing of employees by communicating that they are valued, encouraging them to set and achieve challenging, but achievable, new goals (Locke and Latham, 2020), and communicating their appreciation to them. In addition, supervisors need to involve employees in decision-making, particularly where their input is most valuable (Bashshur and Oc, 2015). Employees can influence work decisions through their feedback if they are involved in important decisions. In organizations, the term voice describes employees\u2019 informal or formal expressions of ideas, opinions, and suggestions aimed at a specific target to change an objectionable situation and improve organizational functioning (Bashshur and Oc, 2015). Employees expect to feel appreciated by the supervisor, know their responsibilities and expectations, know what the supervisor thinks of their performance, and have the information they need about their work and how well they are doing (Rothmann et al., 2013).\nTo target employee performance, supervisors can link performance management to financial rewards (Gabriel and Aguinis, 2022). Remuneration and rewards are ways of\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nfpsyg-13-942923 October 8, 2022 Time: 15:11 # 4\nMurangi et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.942923\nengaging and motivating employees and making them feel that they are being treated fairly and justly. Performance feedback can be considered a valuable resource in the workplace (Gabriel and Aguinis, 2022). When employees receive clear, actionable feedback about their work, they can see the bigger picture, understand what they need to improve, and feel motivated to go the extra mile to achieve their goals (Rothmann et al., 2013; Gabriel and Aguinis, 2022). Performance feedback should focus on strengths and be timely, frequent, specific, verifiable, and consistent (Rothmann and Cooper, 2022).\nBrunsting et al. (2022) found that a lack of autonomy, administrative support, and inadequate planning time predicted SET burnout of SETs. Minghui et al. (2018) showed that social support is a critical job resource for SETs. In Namibia, job resources, including autonomy, co-worker support, and rewards and recognition, showed moderate relationships with the work engagement of SETs (Murangi and Bailey, 2022).\nBillingsley and Bettini (2019) found that SETs\u2019 perceptions of job demands increased their intentions to leave, especially when these demands exceed their capacity to fulfill them. Concerning job resources of SETs, they established that administrative and collegial support contributed to the retention of SETs. Also, modest financial incentives contributed to lower intentions to leave (Billingsley and Bettini, 2019).\nThe effect of job demands and job resources on capabilities\nJob demands might have adverse effects on capabilities depending on employees\u2019 values. The same tasks can be performed from different perspectives. For example, on the one hand, an administrative task might be experienced as engaging by an employee with strong administrative skills who values knowledge and skills. On the other hand, such a task might burden an employee who values meaningful relations with people. Job autonomy and decision latitude as resources might play a role in converting emotional demands to values (e.g., developing new knowledge and skills, or contributing something valuable to society). However, they might also reflect capabilities such as involvement in important decisions and set their own goals (Van der Klink, 2019). Job autonomy might even be regarded as a precondition for other capabilities.\nAccording to Sen (2009), resources such as income have value based on what people can accomplish and be when they use or convert them. Thus, resources are necessary, but not sufficient, for people to function optimally. Employees should have the possibility to take advantage of resources (Van der Klink, 2019). Employees can convert resources into opportunities through conversion factors instrumental to reaching valuable working goals (Robeyns, 2017). Van der Klink (2019) argues that conversion factors can clarify mechanisms that affect capabilities and functionings. For example, a good\ntraining and development policy might not have the intended effects if an organization lacks the staff to make it work. The conversion factors can also explain why people with ample resources do not actualize their full potential. Conversion factors that help employees achieve their valued outcomes despite difficulties are awareness of the organization, selfconfidence, understanding of their abilities, and the willingness to compromise (Van Casteren et al., 2021). Brunsting et al. (2022) found that perceptions of workload manageability mediated the relationship between SETs\u2019 working conditions and burnout.\nJob demands-resources profiles: A person-oriented approach\nStudies have often used a variable-oriented approach to study the associations between job demands and resources and the wellbeing of employees (Collie et al., 2020). According to Howard and Hoffmann (2017), variable-oriented approaches assume homogeneity of the population, which can provide important information about the patterns of relationships between samples and variables. However, this type of research cannot discern whether different subpopulations of employees experience the same demands and resources based on their common characteristics. A person-oriented approach, such as latent profile analysis, is ideal because it identifies distinct profiles of individuals with similar characteristics (Collie et al., 2020).\nA person-oriented approach to job demands and resources is relevant to add to the literature on the CA and the JDR model (Van den Broeck et al., 2011). Firstly, this approach can demonstrate the co-occurrence of job demands and job resources, thus helping to unravel the interrelationship between them. Secondly, a person-oriented approach enables the examination of capabilities and functionings that result from the combined effects of job demands and job resources throughout all job profiles. Thirdly, a person-oriented approach can indicate whether increasing job resources or decreasing job demands is more important for engagement and reducing employee intentions to leave. Using cluster analysis, Van den Broeck et al. (2011) reported four JD-R profiles: demanding, resourceful, poor, and rich jobs. They found that employees in demanding jobs (high job demands and low job resources) showed the poorest wellbeing.\nResearchers have been studying teachers\u2019 experiences at work from a person-oriented perspective (e.g., Collie et al., 2015; Collie and Martin, 2017). However, studies have not focused on JD-R profiles in special teaching contexts. Consequently, the association between such profiles and the capabilities and functionings of SETs remains unknown. Therefore, the distinct combinations of demands and resources for SETs in specific contexts must be investigated to inform policies and practices that facilitate capability identification, development, and optimal functioning. Understanding JD-R profiles is\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nfpsyg-13-942923 October 8, 2022 Time: 15:11 # 5\nMurangi et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.942923\nessential to promoting healthy and effective teachers and schools.\nFunctionings: Work engagement and intention to leave\nTeacher functioning has implications for individuals and for the institutions (i.e., schools and educational institutions) that employ them. According to the CA, as previously mentioned, functionings refer to the beings and doings of individuals (Robeyns, 2017). Engagement and intention to leave are two critical teacher functionings.\nAccording to Schaufeli et al. (2000), work engagement is a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. Teacher engagement contributes to high levels of energy, which are essential for creativity in individualized special education to address diverse learning needs. Teachers who are enabled to capitalize on job resources such as supervisor support, co-worker support, and creative teaching resources can become engaged in their work. Dehaloo and Schulze (2013) found that teachers who experienced low levels of engagement expressed wishes for early retirement or resignation, increased absenteeism due to stress, poor involvement in the class, depression, and a lack of passion and dedication in their work, all of which contribute to poor teacher and learner performance.\nVarious researchers (e.g., Hagaman and Casey, 2018; Billingsley and Bettini, 2019) have expressed concerns about the retention of SETs. Despite an increased focus on why SETs leave the profession, research on teacher attrition is still lacking (Hagaman and Casey, 2018). Individuals\u2019 intention to leave indicates the likelihood of them changing jobs within a specified period (Sousa-Poza and Henneberger, 2004). Literature reviews of special teacher education retention reveal that not enough knowledge of different disabilities, low job satisfaction, lack of professional development, overload, inadequate compensation, absence of mentorship programs, a negative school climate, lack of qualifications, lack of recognition and support from other teachers, and poor administrative support (Billingsley, 2004; Hagaman and Casey, 2018; Billingsley and Bettini, 2019) strongly affect teachers\u2019 intention to leave and actual turnover. If SETs leave, the mandate of special education, which already functions on limited personnel capacity, can become compromised. Special schools cannot function sustainably without teachers, and learners cannot receive a quality education.\nEmployees who can achieve what they value in their work are more likely to be engaged and less likely to leave. Job demands (e.g., pace, workload, mental load, and emotional load) can facilitate or inhibit functioning. If demands are aligned with what employees value, they will be more engaged at work and less likely to leave (Van der Klink, 2019). Conversely, they may suffer from disengagement and leave if these demands are not valued."

All SETs in seven regions in Namibia (Erongo, Caprivi, Kavango, Khomas, Ohangwena, Oshana, and Omusati) formed part of the sampling population for this study. There is an estimated total of 300 SETs in Namibia. Teachers from 17 special schools, special classes in mainstream schools, and inclusive schools formed part of the sample for this study, because they teach learners with special needs (i.e., disabilities) in either educational option. As such, the term special education teacher was adopted in this study to refer to teachers who teach learners with disabilities in special schools, special classes in mainstream schools, and inclusive schools. Inclusive of private schools, Namibia has 1 184 schools, with an estimated student population of 755,943, of which around 24 005 are learners with disabilities enrolled at 17 special schools, special classes within mainstream schools, and inclusive schools around the nation2. In addition, an estimated 300 SETs are employed at these schools \u2013 fewer than mainstream education teachers. In Namibia, SETs receive a 4-year degree in Education, with an option to specialize in special education in the 4th year.\nDespite advancements in policy, empirical research on special education teacher functioning in Namibia are scarce. Given the lack of resources in developing countries, teaching environments will inevitably have more demands and fewer resources due to vast inequalities. However, profiling SETs (through a person-oriented approach) can explain the naturally occurring patterns between job demands and resources and the number of teachers categorized in each profile. There is evidence of studies that investigated phenomena such as teacher engagement and wellbeing (Janik, 2013; Janik and Rothmann, 2015). However, these studies focused on mainstream schools (primary and secondary). Only one study (Murangi and Bailey, 2022) investigated engagement in SETs in Namibia related to job resources and job demands.\nAs in all variable-oriented approach studies, the studies mentioned above point to a relationship between one or two variables in a specific population. However, the personoriented approach identifies whether subgroups exist within a specific population and uncovers the patterns that underlie such subgroups (Howard and Hoffmann, 2017). In this study, the person-oriented approach allowed in-depth profiling of individuals regarding their job demands-resources and capabilities and how such profiles could relate to their engagement and intention to leave.

(2016) focused on the relation between the capability set for work and work role functioning, workability, work performance, hours worked, sickness absence, and sickness absence days in a Dutch working sample. It did not include work engagement and intention to leave as outcomes and correlates of the capability set for work, nor did it focus on SETs. This study aimed to identify JD-R profiles of SETs in Namibia and explore how distinct profiles were associated with their work capabilities and functionings (i.e., work engagement and intention to leave). In this study, latent classes for job demands and resources are not based on an a priori hypothesis. Latent profiles are generated and associated with capabilities and functionings. However, the following hypotheses were set for this study:\nHypothesis 1: Job demands-resources profiles are associated with the specific capabilities and capability set of SETs.\nHypothesis 2: Job demands-resources profiles and the capability set predict the work engagement of SETs."

The CWQ measures three capability components: work values, enablement, and achievement. The seven values are as follows: (a) use of knowledge and skills; (b) development of knowledge and skills; (c) involvement in important decisions; (d) building and maintaining meaningful contacts at work; (e) setting own goals; (f) earning a good income; and (g) contributing to something valuable. For each valued aspect, respondents were asked whether (a) they thought this aspect was important to them (seven items, e.g., \u201cHow important is it for you to have or to be able to build meaningful working relationships at work?\u201d), (b) their work offered them sufficient opportunities to do it (seven items, e.g., \u201cDoes your current work offer you enough opportunities to do that?\u201d), and (c) they were able to succeed in realizing it (seven items, e.g., \u201cTo what extent do you succeed in doing so?\u201d). Response options ranged from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much so).\nThree Flourishing at Work Scale items (FAWS; Rothmann et al., 2019a,b) were used to measure work engagement. The three items measure three dimensions of work engagement, for example, \u201cAt my work, I feel bursting with energy\u201d (vigor), \u201cI am enthusiastic about my job\u201d (dedication), and \u201cI am immersed in my work\u201d (absorption). Schaufeli et al. (2017) reported that a scale using three items to measure work engagement shared 86\u221292% of its variance with a longer nine-item version. Also, the pattern of correlations between work engagement and other indicators was close for a three-item measure compared to a nine-item measure of work engagement. Rothmann et al. (2019b) found an acceptable reliability coefficient (\u03c9 = 0.85) for the scale.\nThe Turnover Intention Scale (TIS; Sj\u00f6berg and Sverke, 2000) was used to measure SETs intentions to leave. The TIS consists of three items (e.g., \u201cIf I were completely free to choose, I would leave this job\u201d). Response options ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Moller and Rothmann (2019) validated the TIS in a study using managers from agribusinesses in South Africa and obtained a Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient of 0.83. The TIS could, therefore, be relied on to measure intention to leave."

Several goodness-of-fit indices and information criteria were used to assess the fit of models (West et al., 2012): the chi-square statistic (the test of absolute fit of the model), standardized root mean residual (SRMR), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and comparative fit index (CFI). For TLI and CFI values to be acceptable, scores higher than 0.90 are required, while values larger than 0.95 indicate excellent fit. Both RMSEA and SRMR values lower than 0.08 indicate a close fit between the model and the data (Wang and Wang, 2020).\nLatent profile analysis (LPA) was used to analyze different JD-R profiles using Mplus 8.7 (Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n, 1998- 2022; Wang and Wang, 2020). The maximum likelihood with robust standard errors (MLR) estimator in Mplus was utilized. Different models with various latent profiles were tested utilizing the MLR estimator. A model was retained when a significant improvement was found from the reference model to the model with more profiles. Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and sample-size adjusted Bayesian information criterion (ABIC) values were used to compare models (Kline, 2016; Wang and Wang, 2020). The optimal number of profiles was determined using the LoMendell-Rubin test (LMR LR; Lo et al., 2001), the adjusted LoMendell-Rubin test (ALMR), and the bootstrapped likelihood ratio test (BLRT; Wang and Wang, 2020). Entropy was verified to determine the quality of profile verification in LPA. Entropy values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating suitable classification (Geiser, 2013). The average latent profile probabilities were studied to determine the probability of correct class membership.

Latent profile analysis identified four JD-R profiles: resourceful jobs, demanding jobs, poor jobs, and rich jobs. JD-R profiles were associated with the capabilities of SETs. Together, JD-R profiles and the capability set predicted a large percentage of the variance in work engagement and a moderate percentage of the variance in intention to leave.\nIn line with Van den Broeck et al.\u2019s (2011) findings, four JD-R profiles were identified through latent profile analysis: the resourceful, demanding, poor, and rich job. The resourceful job featured low demands and moderate to high resources, while moderate demands and low resources characterized the demanding job. The poor job had high demands and low resources. Lastly, the rich job was characterized by moderate demands and high resources.\nJob demands-resources profiles were associated with capabilities. The results showed that a poor job resulted in a low capability to use knowledge and skills. In contrast, resourceful and rich jobs predicted capabilities to develop new knowledge and skills, be involved in important decisions, to build and maintain meaningful relationships, and set their own goals. A poor job negatively affected capabilities to build and maintain meaningful relationships, set own goals, and contribute to something valuable.

The following capabilities were associated with work engagement: the use of knowledge and skills, development of knowledge and skills, involvement in important decisions, building and maintaining meaningful relationships at work, setting own goals, earning a good income, and contributing to something valuable. Furthermore, the use of knowledge and skills, development of knowledge and skills, involvement in important decisions, building and maintaining meaningful relationships at work, contributing to something valuable, and earning a good income were associated with SETs\u2019 intentions to leave.\nJob demands-resources profiles and specific capabilities were associated with the work engagement of SETs. More specifically, the results showed that resourceful and rich jobs combined with each of the following capabilities predicted large percentages of the variances (varying from 25% to 28%) in work engagement: using knowledge and skills, developing new knowledge and skills, being involved in important decisions, building and maintaining meaningful work relationships, setting own goals, earning a good income, and contributing to something valuable. Resourceful and rich jobs and the capability set also predicted a large percentage of the variance in work engagement. These findings confirmed that resourceful and rich jobs, characterized by moderate workload, and resources such as job characteristics, supportive supervisory relationships, salary, and performance support mattered for work engagement. However, the capabilities of SETs also mattered for their work engagement. Moreover, SETs in these JD-R profiles (compared to demanding and poor jobs) experienced lower emotional demands. Although Minghui et al. (2018), Murangi and Bailey (2022) conducted variable-oriented (rather than personoriented) studies, their findings showed that job demands and resources (e.g., autonomy, colleague support and rewards, and recognition) were associated with work engagement.\nConcerning intention to leave as a dependent variable, the results showed that the absence of a rich job and each of the following capabilities predicted moderate percentages of the variance: use of knowledge and skills, development of new knowledge and skills, involvement in important decisions, building and maintaining meaningful work relationships, setting own goals, earning a good income, and contributing to something valuable. Moreover, a rich job and the capability set of SETs predicted low intentions to leave. These results showed that a rich job, accompanied by a capability set (and specific capabilities), mattered for the retention of SETs.\nInterestingly, JD-R profiles (specifically resourceful and rich jobs) were better predictors of work engagement than intentions to leave. Resourceful and rich jobs were characterized by low to\nmoderate job demands and the availability of high job resources. Research confirms that the more job resources there are in a work context (compared to job demands), the more engaged employees will be (Albrecht et al., 2021). This finding might be explained by the lack of mobility of SETs in Namibia. Having fewer options for employment tends to make people less likely to leave their jobs (Shapira-Lishchinsky, 2012). Therefore, SETs might have lower intentions to leave because of the lack of opportunities in the Namibian education sector and labor market.\nJob demands (e.g., pace, workload, mental, and emotional load) can facilitate or inhibit functioning. If demands are aligned with what SETs value, they will be more engaged at work and less likely to leave (Van der Klink, 2019). Conversely, they may suffer from disengagement and leave if these demands are not valued. The findings indicated that an ideal job environment for a special education teacher in Namibia would be a rich job characterized by moderate job demands and high job resources. Regarding overload, SETs in rich jobs did not differ much from those in poor jobs, although SETs in poor jobs experienced more emotional demands than those in rich jobs. However, rich and poor jobs differed most in terms of the availability of job resources, such as experiences of the nature of the job, supervisory support, salary, and performance support (in line with findings of variable-oriented studies, e.g., Minghui et al., 2018; Brunsting et al., 2022; Murangi and Bailey, 2022). Indeed, job autonomy and supervisor support as resources might play a role in converting emotional demands to values (e.g., developing new knowledge and skills or contributing something valuable to society).\nFurthermore, the capabilities of teachers, including involvement in important decisions, developing knowledge and skills, building and maintaining meaningful relationships at work, setting their own goals, earning a good income, and contributing to something valuable, are critical. Unfortunately, however, few teachers were in the rich job profile. These findings support the usefulness of the SE framework. It seems essential to consider capabilities based on values, opportunities, and achievements (Abma et al., 2016; Van der Klink et al., 2016; Van der Klink, 2019). A rich JD-R profile is essential to develop and optimize teacher capability and enhance teachers\u2019 work engagement. Zimba et al. (2013) found that teachers in Namibia had to deal with heavy administration work, large classrooms, a lack of teaching materials, and limited learning and training opportunities. According to Dehaloo and Schulze (2013), teachers face heavy workloads, poor remuneration, and limited learning and career advancement opportunities, which negatively affect their work engagement. Specifically, in developing countries where poverty and vast inequalities exist, it has proven challenging to provide adequate resources to help teachers function effectively (Ncube and Hlatywayo, 2014).\nTeachers in demanding and poor jobs will become less engaged and more inclined to leave, placing their sustainable\nFrontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin.org\nfpsyg-13-942923 October 8, 2022 Time: 15:11 # 16\nMurangi et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.942923\nemployability at risk. The current study results indicated that more than half (n = 104) of SETs in Namibia experienced demanding or poor jobs. This is disastrous for learners with disabilities who need special education schools to become capable citizens, their parents, and the Ministry of Education, Arts, and Culture in Namibia.\nBillingsley and Bettini (2019) raised a question about the type of demands that will affect SETs adversely. The study\u2019s results showed that emotional demands played a larger role than pace and amount of work in predicting disengagement and intentions to leave, whereas job demands played a smaller role. High emotional demands, overload, and a lack of resources interfere with teachers\u2019 functioning (e.g., work engagement and intention to leave). Moreover, job demands and resources were associated with SETs\u2019 work engagement and intentions to leave. Teachers in rich jobs (with moderate demands, high resources) and resourceful jobs (with low job demands, moderate job resources) were more engaged compared to those in demanding jobs (with moderate job demands, low job resources). However, it seems that it was not only the combination of job demands and resources that mattered; the capabilities of teachers also played a vital role. Specific capabilities that mattered for teachers\u2019 work engagement included using existing knowledge and skills, meaningful work relations, and setting own goals. However, more than specific capabilities, it was evident that the capability set played a significant positive role in the work engagement of SETs.\nConcerning retention, the results showed that a combination of job demands and resources explained a moderate percentage of the variance in the SETs\u2019 intentions to leave (as suggested by Billingsley and Bettini, 2019). Teachers in the rich JD-R profile (compared to the demanding profile) had significantly lower intentions to leave. However, in addition to the JD-R, a lack of two specific capabilities, namely using existing knowledge and skills and earning a good income, also contributed to intentions to leave. Moreover, the capability set JD-R profiles explained a moderate percentage of the variance in SETs\u2019 intentions to leave.\nTo sustain quality special education provision in Namibia, the focus must be on enhancing and building the capabilities of SETs. Interventions should focus on all capabilities to develop and strengthen the capability set (which consists of values, enablement, and achievement). To facilitate the work value development of teachers (and individuals who are trained as teachers), managers should question their core assumptions about human nature and understand how their mental models affect their managerial practices (Heil et al., 2000; Grant, 2021). Efficient and effective human resource management practices (e.g., recruitment and selection, induction, training and development, coaching and mentorship, occupational health and wellbeing, performance management and remuneration) are vital to building the three dimensions of capabilities (i.e., values, enablement,\nand achievement). In the performance management process, managers and teachers must understand the seven capabilities and communicate about values, enablement, and achievement.\nThe resources of special education schools must be upgraded (Billingsley and Bettini, 2019). A balance of job demands and resources does not imply that individuals are engaged and will not quit their jobs. As suggested by the capability approach, resources are inadequate indicators of wellbeing since individuals have different needs for resources and different abilities to convert them into functionings. Work engagement and retention of SETs require more than just resources; capabilities of teachers should be developed to counteract challenges such as the large classrooms, the lack of assistive teaching and learning devices, high workloads, the shortage of teachers, and a lack of teaching materials (Haihambo, 2004; Murangi and Bailey, 2022). It is essential to assess how job demands and resources affect teachers\u2019 capabilities and implement interventions directed at workload, role clarity, colleague support, supervisor relations, and providing resources (Buckingham and Goodall, 2019; Rothmann and Cooper, 2022). Many SETs are in poor and demanding jobs. Van den Broeck et al. (2011) assert that increasing job resources in the poor and demanding job profiles may benefit employees. Teachers should be enabled by crafting resourceful and rich jobs. Chitiyo et al. (2019) found that SETs in Namibia needed professional development regarding behavior management, learning strategies, diversity management, instructional methods, assessment, knowledge of types of disabilities, teaching life skills, and collaboration with parents. Investing in job resources and capabilities of SETs can contribute to their work engagement and retention.\nLimitations and recommendations for future research\nSeveral limitations were encountered in this study. Firstly, only 200 SETs, from a total of 300, participated in the study due to the voluntary nature of the study, coupled with COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, teachers had a lot of teaching content to cover due to the unforeseen lockdowns. As such, teacher time was limited. Therefore, it is impossible to generalize the findings to all SETs in Namibia. Future studies must be cognizant of periods in the year when constraints on teacher time are fewer to reach more teachers. Secondly, while using a crosssectional survey in this study was helpful in cost-effectively exploring the relations between constructs (Spector, 2019), it is impossible to prove the causality of predictions. A longitudinal study will help uncover patterns in SETs job demands and resources, capabilities, and functioning over time. Thirdly,\nFrontiers in Psychology 16 frontiersin.org\nfpsyg-13-942923 October 8, 2022 Time: 15:11 # 17\nMurangi et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.942923\nan existing measure of work values was used (Abma et al., 2016). However, unique work values might exist in Namibia. In the future, cross-cultural qualitative studies might be valuable to investigate whether more African-specific work values should be included in a capability measure. Billingsley and Bettini (2019) also recommended that high-quality qualitative methods be used to study specific functionings (such as the retention of SETs). Fourthly, although interactions between job demands and resources were considered (by using latent profile analysis) in this study, future studies might focus on the interactions between job demands and resources and capabilities in a variable-oriented study to capture the complex interrelationships between variables that impact work engagement and intentions to leave of SETs (see Billingsley and Bettini, 2019). Fifthly, more female SETs (68.5%) participated in the study. The present study did not investigate the reasons for the dominance of females in the SET profession. Future studies should investigate the role of gender concerning capabilities and functioning teachers in the SET profession."

The study provided insight into the JD-R profiles that predicted the capabilities of SETs in Namibia. The JDR profiles created for this study indicated that the ideal job profile, which could significantly impact engagement and reduce turnover intentions, was the rich job profile. The question that needs to be investigated by all stakeholders is what strategies can be employed to create rich jobs in Namibian special schools to promote the sustainable employability of SETs.\nThe person-oriented approach employed to study the combined effects of job demands and resources on the capabilities of SETs resulted in valuable insights into their functionings. The distinct combinations of demands and resources should inform policies and practices that facilitate capability identification, development, and optimal functioning of SETs in Namibia."
