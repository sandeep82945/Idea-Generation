    "abstractText": "Background: Increased \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels can deplete plasma glutathione, which in turn impairs immune regulation; however, evidence on GGT levels and postvaccine immunogenicity is lacking. Objective: To examine the association between GGT and SARSCoV-2 spike IgG antibodies. Methods: Participants were 1479 medical staff (aged 21 to 75 years) who received a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test after their second vaccine and whose GGT levels were measured before the vaccine rollout. Elevated and highly elevated GGT levels were defined as 51\u201380 and \u226581 U/L, respectively. Multivariable linear regression was used to calculate the means of SARS-CoV2 spike IgG. Results: In a basic model, both elevated and highly elevated GGT levels were associated with significantly lower antibody titers. The ratio of mean (95% CI) was 0.83 (0.72\u20130.97) and 0.69 (0.57\u20130.84) for elevated and highly elevated GGT levels, respectively. However, these associations were largely attenuated after additional adjustment for potential confounders. An inverse association between GGT levels and antibody titers was found in women [0.70 (0.51\u20130.97)], normal-weight adults [0.71 (0.51\u20130.98)], and non-drinkers [0.73 (0.46\u20131.14)] but not in men, overweight adults, and alcohol drinkers. Conclusions: Circulating GGT concentrations were associated with the humoral immune response after COVID-19 vaccination, but this relationship could be ascribed to confounders such as sex, BMI, and alcohol drinking rather than GGT per se.",

            "text": "Clinical studies showed that the COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing severe forms of COVID-19 [1]. Several studies examined the safety and immunogenicity of COVID19 vaccines among patients with comorbidities (e.g., obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases) [2\u20134]. Since the liver has an important role in the adaptive/specific immune response through the direct or indirect priming of T and B lymphocytes and defending against harmful pathogens [5], liver dysfunction may interfere with vaccine-induced antibody production. However, the evidence on individuals with liver dysfunction is not sufficient \u03b3-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), an enzyme localized in the biliary poles of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes [6], is a clinical marker of liver injury [7,8]. Moreover, GGT plays an important role in glutathione (GSH) metabolism by mitigating oxidative stress or inflammation and regulating innate immunity [9\u201311]. However, increased levels of GGT can deplete plasma GSH, which in turn impairs immune regulation [10,11]. Epidemiological studies showed that an increase in the risk of non-communicable diseases (e.g.,\nVaccines 2022, 10, 2142. https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10122142 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/vaccines\ndiabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, etc.) is associated with higher GGT levels [10,12]. Recent investigations also revealed a link between higher GGT levels and poor outcomes of COVID-19 [13\u201315]. In the post-vaccine era, whether elevated GGT levels interfere with vaccine-induced immunogenicity is of interest. To the best of our knowledge, only one study addressed this issue and reported significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titers among those with higher GGT levels [16]. However, that study did not adjust for potentially important confounders, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and alcohol drinking. It has been reported that levels of GGT differ across age and gender [17,18] and are clinical markers of heavy alcohol drinking [19] and of abdominal fat distribution [20], all of which are known determinants of vaccine-induced immunogenicity [21\u201323]. Thus, it remains elusive whether the GGT-antibody association is confounded or modified by these variables. Here, we investigated the association between SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titers after two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and pre-vaccinated GGT levels, considering potential confounders such as gender, alcohol drinking, and obesity. We additionally examined whether the association between GGT levels and antibody titers is modified by these factors."

The estimates obtained were then backtransformed to present the geometric mean titer (95% CI) and the ratio of mean (95% CI). Additionally, we assessed antibody titers across GGT level quartiles. To examine whether the association between GGT levels and antibody titers differs depending on gender, alcohol drinking status, and being overweight (<23 kg/m2 or \u226523 kg/m2) according to the WHO classification of BMI for Asians [27], we performed a series of stratified analyses with these variables.

            "text": "In the present study among hospital workers who completed two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, those with higher GGT levels had lower mean SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibody titers in the crude model. However, this association was largely attenuated after multivariable adjustment. In the stratified analyses, highly elevated GGT levels were associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibody titers in women, normal-weight adults, and non-drinkers but not in men, overweight or obese adults, and alcohol drinkers. Our finding of an inverse association between GGT levels and antibody titers in a simple model is compatible with that of a Japanese study among vaccine recipients, which reported significantly higher median GGT levels in a group with lower antibody titers without adjustment for covariates [16]. However, the inverse association in our study was largely attenuated after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, and alcohol drinking, which are determinants of both GGT levels [17\u201320] and vaccine-induced immunogenicity [21\u201323]. This result suggests that the observed association observed in the simple model is largely driven by these confounding variables. In the stratified analyses, we found an inverse association between elevated GGT levels and antibody titers in the subgroups with lower mean GGT levels (women, alcohol non-drinkers, and normal-weight adults) but not in their counterparts. The reason for these findings is unclear. We speculate that higher circulating levels of GGT reflect lower levels of glutathione, which play an important role in immune response to viral infection [10,11], only among those free of these determinants. Additional studies are required to confirm whether GGT is a good marker of glutathione and thus associated with poor post-vaccine antibody productions in a group of people without known determinants of GGT. The strength of the present study includes its relatively large sample, adjustment for a wide range of potential covariates, and measurement of GGT levels prior to vaccine administration and antibody measurement, which precludes the possibility of reverse causation. This study also has some limitations that warrant mentioning. First, we did not measure neutralizing antibodies, which are reliable markers of the humoral immune response. Nonetheless, spike antibody titers measured with the assay we employed were well-correlated with the neutralizing antibody titers in vaccine recipients (Spearmen\u2019s rank correlation coefficient was 0.91 and 0.83 for the wild-type and Delta live virus, respectively) [28]. Second, we did not measure cellular immune response, another key mechanism of disease control and infection protection [29]. Finally, study participants were apparently healthy, not primarily women (n = 16), alcohol non-drinkers (n = 8), and normal-weight adults (n = 14) in the group with highly elevated GGT levels, so caution should be exercised when generalizing these findings to other populations. In summary, the inverse association between circulating GGT levels and SARS-CoV2 spike IgG antibody titers that was observed in a bivariable analysis was markedly attenuated after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, and alcohol drinking, suggesting that circulating GGT levels may not be independently associated with the humoral immune response after vaccination. The inverse association between GGT levels and antibody titers observed in the subgroups characterized by lower GGT levels (women, normal-weight adults, or alcohol non-drinkers) requires confirmation.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/vaccines10122142/s1, Figure S1: Study design.; Figure S2: Geometric means of \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase on the SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titers.; Table S1: Ratio of mean (95% CI) of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titers according to the status of \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (according to the Japan Society of Ningen Dock. 2022) according to gender, drinking status, and BMI.
