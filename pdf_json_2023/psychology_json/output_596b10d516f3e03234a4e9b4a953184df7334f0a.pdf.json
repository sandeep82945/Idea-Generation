    "abstractText": "This study explores the electrochemical reduction in CO2 using room temperature ionic liquids as solvents or electrolytes, which can minimize the environmental impact of CO2 emissions. To design effective CO2 electrochemical systems, it is crucial to identify intermediate surface species and reaction products in situ. The study investigates the electrochemical reduction in CO2 using a cobalt porphyrin molecular immobilized electrode in 1-n-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMI.BF4) room temperature ionic liquids, through in-situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and electrochemical technique. The results show that the highest faradaic efficiency of CO produced from the electrochemical reduction in CO2 can reach 98%. With the potential getting more negative, the faradaic efficiency of CO decreases while H2 is produced as a competitive product. Besides, water protonates porphyrin macrocycle, producing pholorin as the key intermediate for the hydrogen evolution reaction, leading to the out-of-plane mode of the porphyrin molecule. Absorption of CO2 by the ionic liquids leads to the formation of BMI\u00b7CO2 adduct in BMI\u00b7BF4 solution, causing vibration modes at 1100, 1457, and 1509 cm\u22121. However, the key intermediate of CO\u2212 2 \u00b7 radical is not observed. The \u03c5(CO) stretching mode of absorbed CO is affected by the electrochemical Stark effect, typical of CO chemisorbed on a top site.",

            "text": "Carbon dioxide is a harmful by-product of fossil fuels combustion that poses serious environmental problems such as global warming as its concentration in the atmosphere accumulation. However, it is also an abundant raw material that can be converted into high-value products, such as CO [1], formic acid [2], and methanol [3] by means of electrochemical reduction [4\u20136]. This process not only addresses environmental issues, but also provides a sustainable energy source. Unfortunately, CO2 is an inert, linear molecule that requires high energy input to activate and form the common first key intermediate CO\u22122 \u00b7 anion radical which requires a high-energy potential with an equilibrium potential of \u22121.9 V vs. a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE, pH = 7) [7]. As a result, electrochemical reduction in CO2 must proceed catalytically, with sensitivity of the products determined by the electrode material used. Early investigations into CO2 electrochemical reduction were generally conducted in aqueous solution, resulting in a primary reaction pathway competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Additionally, the limited solubility of CO2 in aqueous solution results in low faradaic efficiency for the products. To overcome these challenges, organic solvents and room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have been implemented as solvents for the reaction [8\u201310]. Room-temperature ionic liquids are a unique class of solvents that are being investigated for their potential as superior alternatives to organic solvents in electrochemical applications. This is because they have a wide electrochemical window [11], thermal and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2747. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062747 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2747 2 of 13\nchemical stability [12], negligible volatility [13,14], and can be used as electron transfer mediators for redox catalysis [14]. In recent years, RTILS have gained attention as promising materials for electrochemical reduction CO2 technology due to their high selectivity and relatively high CO2 adsorption capacity. The solubility of CO2 in a serious of fluorine-free RTILs has been investigated by Palgunadi et al. [15,16]. They suggested that the longer alkyl chain in the dibutylphosphate anion creates a larger free volume to accommodate more CO2 molecules. Azhar et al. investigated the solubility of CO2 in an aqueous solution of monoehanolamin and 1\u2013butyl\u20133\u2013methylimidazolium dibutylphosphate (BMIM\u00b7DBP) ionic liquid hybrid solvents [17]. Based on response surface methodology (RSM) and mathematical modelling, they predicted the optimum conditions for CO2 absorption. Rosen et al. reported 2011 that the overpotential of the electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO is below 0.2 volt by utilizing EMIM\u2013BF4 ionic liquid to lower the activation energy of CO2. The ionic liquids also helped increases the selectivity of CO2 to CO to above 95%. Ref. [18] Latter, Zhao et al. investigated the role of cation of ionic liquids in the heterogeneous/homogeneous CO2 electrocatalysis reduction process. According to their assertion, the presence of imidazolium and pyrrolidium cations significantly improved the electroreduction in CO2 using Ag as an electrocatalyst, particularly in the presence of water [19]. The local ionic liquid environment has been established at an iron porphyrin catalyst to enhance electrocatalytic performance of CO2 to CO reduction by Khadhraoui et al. [5]. Despite the fact that ionic liquids possess the ability to stabilize the potential intermediate CO\u22122 \u00b7, rendering them highly desirable for the CO2 electrochemical reduction technique, the implementation of the technology utilizing RTILs is still a long way off [18]. It is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of electrochemical reduction in ionic liquids for the rational design of such systems. As a result, considerable research efforts have been directed towards this area. Tanner et al. conducted a screening experiment involving a combinations of metal electrodes, RTIL cations and anions to unravel the fundamental mechanism involved in electrochemical CO2 reduction [20]. Their findings revealed that Ag was the most efficient electrode material in [Bmim][NTf2] and the CO2 reduction activity was dependent on cations. They suggested that components of ionic liquids played a complex role in the CO2 reduction mechanism by potentially modifying the nature of the double-layer formed at the electrode surface. Lau et al. conducted a screening experiment that yielded intriguing results. Their findings indicated that the improved activity of imidazolium based RTILs was attributed to the hydrogen atoms at the C4 and C5 positions, rather than those at the C2 position [21]. Theoretical investigations have also been extensively explored the fundamental mechanism of electrochemical CO2 reduction in RTIL-based solvents. Norskov\u2019s group, in particular, has focused on analyzing the impact of the electric field generated by cations in the vicinity of the electrode surface [22]. Additionally, Urushihara et al. conducted first-principles-based thermodynamic stability analysis (Pourbaix diagram) of [Emim] at the Ag(111) and water interface, which varied as a function of electrochemical potential and [Emim] concentration. Their simulations involved the solvation effect, which was modeling using a combination of explicit water molecules adsorbed on the electrode surface and implicit water modeled as a dielectric medium [23]. Despite the extensive research efforts, the comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of RTIL-based electrochemical CO2 reduction remains limited. In-situ surface-sensitive techniques are essential for understanding the structureactivity relationship and reaction mechanism at a molecular level in heterogeneous catalysis. In the case of Pt electrode and [Emim][BF4] system, Rosen et al. utilized the SFG (Sum Frequency Generation) spectrum observed CH3 bending and ring stretching modes at 1430 cm\u22121 and 1570 cm\u22121, respectively. These observations suggest that the [Emim] cations preferentially reside at the electrode surface during electrolysis. Furthermore, they found that during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, as the cathode potential became more negative, a sharp peak at 2348 cm\u22121 appeared gradually attributing to the formation of an [Emim] \u2013CO2\u2013 [BF4] complex at the electrode surface [24]. Osawa\u2019s\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2747 3 of 13\ngroup has used surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) to investigate the interface between an Au electrode and either pure 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide ([Bmim][TFSA]) or a [Bmim][TFSA]/water mixture solvent. By directly integrating specific SEIRAS peaks during cyclic voltammetry measurements, the authors were able to observe potential-dependent restructuring of the solvent components at the electrode surface. This restructuring included changes in the orientation and interactions of the [Bmim][TFSA] cations and anions and water molecules [25,26]. The other widely used in-situ techniques for this purpose is surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which provides rich structural information on structural information on adsorbed molecules at very low concentration [27]. Santos et al. investigated the vibration of the RTILs derived from 1\u2013n\u2013butyl\u20133\u2013methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMI\u00b7PF6) adsorbed on a silver electrode by SERS. The researchers observed that the BMI\u00b7PF6 cation adsorbs on the silver electrode for potentials more negative than \u22120.4 V vs. a Pt quasireference electrode (PQRE). At potentials more negative than \u22121.0 V, some imidazolium ring vibrational modes and N-CH3 vibrations were enhanced, suggesting that the imidazolium ring is parallel to the surface [28]. The electrochemical reduction in CO2 over a copper electrode in the RTILs, 1\u2013n\u2013butyl\u20133\u2013methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMI\u00b7BF4), was investigated using in-situ SERS by Santos Jr. et al. The SERS results showed that CO adsorbs on copper surface at two different surface sites. Additionally, a vibration at 2275 cm\u22121 was observed in the SERS spectra, confirming the presence of chemically adsorbed CO2. This suggests that the reduction in CO2 over the copper electrode in BMI\u00b7BF4 involves multiple surface reaction pathways [29]. Metalloporphyrins are known to exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity towards CO2 when self-assembled or immobilized on graphite, glassy carbon and metal surfaces, but a plausible mechanism for their electrochemical reduction in CO2 was lacking solid evidence [30\u201332]. To address this gap, the combination of in-situ SERS and electrochemistry is used to interpret the reliable adsorbate structure with the precise controlling potential of working electrode (WE). Overall, in-situ surface-sensitive techniques such as SERS play a critical role in advancing our understanding of heterogeneous catalysis and developing more sustainable and efficient energy conversion technologies. In this study, we utilize the sophisticated in-situ SERS methodology and electrochemical technique to authenticate the configuration of the intermediate species involved in the electrochemical reduction in CO2 facilitated by cobalt protoporphyrin in RTILs. Through analysis of the in-situ spectrum, we are able to infer the mechanism underlying the electrochemical reduction in CO2. This approach allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the electrochemical reduction process and the intermediate species involved. This study highlights the potential of in-situ SERS methodology to provide important insights into the mechanism of electrochemical reactions and to guide the development of more sustainable energy conversion technologies."

In the case of hemin, the \u03bd4 vibration mode corresponds to C\u2013N stretch vibrations of the pyrrole subunits, which are sensitive to electron transfer in the \u03c0* orbital of the porphyrin ring and serve as an indicator of the iron oxidation state [38].

Metal porphyrins have shown great potential as molecular catalysts for the electrochemically triggered hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their ability to participate in different proton-coupled electron transfer process (PCET) in the past few decades [46\u201348]. These processes generate intermediates that can donate hydrides to free protons, thus releasing hydrogen. The exact pathway of metalloporphyrin catalyzed HER is still a subject of ongoing research and debate, and several proposed mechanisms exist. The theoretical studies by Nocera and Hammes-Schiffer suggest that cobalt meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin can act as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by facilitating the reduction and protonation of the porphyrin macrocycle [49]. Hung and collaborators reported that the HER catalytic mechanism occurs via [P-CoIII-H] or [P-CoII-H]\u22121 metal hydrides for cobalt porphyrins [50].

It is noticeable that the initial potential for BMI-CO2 adduct is at \u22120.6 V which is more negative than that for the protonation of porphyrin macrocycle. The interaction between CO2 and ILs is possible due to the capability of ILs to encapsulate CO2 within cavities close to alkyl groups and aromatic protons of the IL [53]. This interaction does not interfere with the interaction of the counter ion of the IL, which result in the formation of the BMI-CO2 adduct.

Some ILs, such as 1\u2013ethyl\u20133\u2013methyl\u2013imidazolium trifluorochloroborate ([EMIM][BF3Cl]) IL, can interact with CO2 through a Lewis base adduct, making them active for CO2 electroreduction reaction [54]. Ionic Liquids (ILs) are highly efficient materials for CO2 electroreduction, as they serve as both electrolytes and functionalized materials. They offer kinetic effects that reduce the energy required for intermediate CO\u22122 \u00b7 formation, resulting in an improved CO2 ERR efficiency. In one study, methylimidazolium groups are attached to the edge of an iron porphyrin, to create a pre-arranged environment that displays outstanding selectivity for CO production at low overpotentials when using water as the solvent and proton source [5]. According to the findings of Vianney O. Santos Jr. et al., who conducts an investigation on the electrochemical reduction in CO2 on a copper electrode in BMI\u00b7BF4 using SERS as a monitoring tool, the peaks at 1532, 1492, 1281, 1091, and 672 cm\u22121 are assigned to the vibrational modes of the BMI\u2013CO2 adduct [29]. Based on the spectra and previous research, it seems that the peaks at 1100, 1457, and 1509 cm\u22121 can also be attributed to the vibrational modes of the BMI-CO2 adduct. This is consistent with previous studies on the electrochemical reduction in CO2 in ionic liquids, which have shown that ILs can interact with CO2 to form adducts [51]. It is interesting to note that the SERS spectra do not show any signal that could be attributed to the CO\u22122 \u00b7 anion radical, which has been observed in other studies using pulse radiolysis time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculation [55]. The peaks indicate the oxidation state of cobalt at 1347 and 1390 cm\u22121 suggest the presence of both CoII and CoIII, with the intensity of the peak for CoII as the potential becomes more negative due to the reduction in CoIII. The vibration modes correspond to the \u03c5(C-C) stretch vibrations at 1564 cm\u22121 suggest that the oxidation state of cobalt is mainly CoIII with a small vibration mode at 1534 cm\u22121 attributed to CoII and overlapping with the BMI\u00b7CO2 feature. The feature at 2124 cm\u22121 is assigned to the \u03c51 CO stretching modes, where CO adsorbed on the cobalt center as shown in Figure 6a. The IR spectra of Fe(TPP) and Co(TPP) adducts with CO are discussed in literatures, showing CO stretching bands at 2138 and 2149 cm\u22121, which are attribute to matrix isolated monomeric carbon monoxide and CO bound H2O traces, respectively [56,57].

Therefore, it is reasonable to assign the peal at 2124 cm\u22121 to the CO stretching band originating from monomeric CO.

The results showed that cobalt porphyrin adsorbs successfully on the surface of the Ag electrode, exhibiting marker vibration modes of \u03c5(C\u2013N) and \u03c5(C\u2013C) at 1351, 1399 cm\u22121 and 1532, 1558 cm\u22121 for CoIII and CoII, respectively. Water served as a proton source, and the vibration modes assigned for the out-of-plane mode of protonated porphyrin molecule indicated that the key intermediate for competing HER and CO2 electrochemical reduction is pholorin. The use of ionic liquids helps to activate CO2 through the formation of the BMI\u00b7CO2 adduct, which leads to the formation of [PP\u2013Co\u2013COOH]\u2212 intermediate for the final product. These findings provide insights into the molecular-level understanding of CO2 electrochemical reduction and can aid in the design of more efficient and environmentally sustainable CO2 conversion systems. However, the molecular structure of the cation in ionic liquids plays a critical role in determining the electrochemical reduction in CO2 reaction. The properties of the cation, such as ion size, shape, charge and functional groups can significantly influence the reaction mechanism, kinetics, and selectivity. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between the cation structure and electrochemical performance and to develop new strategies for optimizing the catalytic properties of ionic liquids.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2747 11 of 13\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.W. and J.S.; methodology, F.W. and J.S.; validation, F.W., F.J., J.Y. and W.D.; formal analysis, F.W., F.J., J.Y. and W.D.; investigation, F.W., F.J., J.Y. and W.D.; data curation, F.W., F.J., J.Y. and W.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.W.; writing\u2014 review and editing, D.L., J.S., and Z.F.; visualization, F.W. and J.S.; supervision, J.S. and Z.F.; project administration, D.L., J.S. and Z.F.; funding acquisition, D.L., J.S. and Z.F.
