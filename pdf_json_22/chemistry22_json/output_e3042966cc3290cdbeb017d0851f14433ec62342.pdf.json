            "text": "The directed activation of carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds (C\u2013H) is a topic of increasing importance with a wide range of applications in organic synthesis.1 However, one of the major challenges in selective, catalytic functionalization of C\u2013H bonds is to enable the use of native substrates without covalently installing external directing groups. Transient directing groups (TDGs), which form reversible linkages with the substrates in situ, complement a promising alternative approach to direct metal-catalysed or -mediated C\u2013H functionalization, thereby avoiding the additional installation and removal of directing groups.2 While most of the achievements for TDG-mediated and Pd-catalyzed C(sp2)\u2013H functionalization are restricted in C(sp2)\u2013 H arylation,3 alkylation,4 and alkenylation,5 efforts to develop Pd-catalyzed C(sp2)\u2013O and C(sp2)\u2013N bond forming reactions have recently afforded new advances.6 Recently, the seminal examples of these rare reactions, which were reported by Erik J. Sorensen and co-workers, featured the utilization of 4-chloroanthranilic acid as the bidentate transient directing group (BiTDG), and 1-uoro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridnium triate as the bystanding oxidant.7 Soon aer, ortho-C\u2013H methoxylation and uoroalkoxylation of benzaldehydes were also realized by employing monodentate directing groups8a and BiTDG respectively which form N, O-bis-coordinated complexes with Pd(II) catalyst and promote the C\u2013H activation process.8b\niversity of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, angjunliangedu@163.com; sunruifen@\ny, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan\nmation (ESI) available. See\n727\nNevertheless, mild and selective transformations of this type are still largely undeveloped and the new catalytic TDGs, e.g., N, Nbidentate coordination, remain to be further exploited. Therefore, the investigation of new TDGs allowing exible and diverse reactivities is of great importance and highly desirable.\nThe use of the peptide backbone in site-selective C\u2013H oxygenations of tripeptides presented catalytic action by N, Nbidentate coordination of amide groups with Pd (Scheme 1A).9 Signicantly, a bulky, amino amide transient directing group was developed to selectively promote the benzylic C(sp3)\u2013H acetoxylation with low yield (29%) (Scheme 1B).10 Based on this particular investigation and our previous studies of using\nScheme 1 Controlled site-selective C\u2013H bond oxygenation.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Herein, we report an amino amide as TDG utilized to promote C(sp2)\u2013H oxygenation of broad range of benzaldehydes and benzylic amines using N-uoro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium tetrauoroborate as the bystanding oxidant (Scheme 1C), the protocol features a one-step coupling between a wide range of benzaldehydes and benzylic amines and alcohols via C\u2013O bond formation at the unactivated positions.11\nTo establish the viability of the C(sp2)\u2013H oxygenation of benzaldehydes, diverse molecules containing amino groups were investigated their role in palladium-catalyzed oxygenation of benzaldehyde (1a) with triuoroethanol (2a) in the presence of 10 mol% of Pd(OAc)2, 2 equiv. of TFA and 2 equiv. of K2S2O8 (Table 1). First, commercially available glycinamides, such as 2- aminoacetamide hydrochloride (A1) and 2-aminopropanamide hydrochloride (A2), and hydrazides, such as picolinohydrazide (A3) and acetohydrazide (A4), were employed as TDGs for C(sp2)\u2013H oxygenation and all afforded low yield. To further explore the efficiency of TDG, the screening of selected short peptides was conducted. It turned out that the reaction failed with 2-(2-aminoacetamido)acetic acid (A5) as the TDG, inversely its analogue, 2-(2-(2-aminoacetamido)acetamido)- acetic acid\nTable 1 TDG evaluation for the C(sp2)\u2013H oxygenation of benzaldehydesa\na Reaction conditions: 1a (0.2 mmol), TFE (2 mL), Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol%), TDG (50 mol%), K2S2O8 (0.4 mmol), TFA (2 equiv.) and stirred at 80 C for 12 h. The per-centages under the chemical structures are their isolated yields.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\n(A6), exhibited moderate catalytic activity. In contrast, all substituted peptides (A7\u2013A9) led to the formation of the desired oxidation products (3a) compared with A5, and A9 afforded the best result. Then, a control experiment without a TDG afforded no desired product, indicating that TDGs are crucial to this reaction.\nWith the best TDG in the presence of K2S2O8 identied, we tested different oxidants and found that 1-uoro-2,4,6trimethylpyridinium tetrauoroborate F1 resulted in a better yield (Table 2, entries 1\u20135). Screening of the amount of TFA indicated that either low or high loading was not benecial for the reaction (Table 2, entries 6\u201310), and 2 equiv. of TFA were still preferred. Other reaction parameters, including reaction temperature and solvents, were examined. Decreases in the reaction temperature led to an obvious drop in the yield (Table\nEntry Oxidant TFA (equiv.)

Compared with triuoroethanol, other solvents, such as toluene and dichloromethane, were not applicable to the reaction (Table 2, entries 13\u201317). Additionally, 2-aminopropanoic acid was used as a contrast TDG under the optimum conditions, only 35% yield was achieved (Table 2, entry 18). Therefore, it can be presumed that the short peptides rather than its, hydrolysate can coordinate with Pd(II) via N, Nbidentate coordination and further promote the C\u2013H activation process. Interestingly, a lower yield was observed with either increased or decreased loading of the A9 (Table 2, entries 19 and 20). Lastly, control experiments show both Pd(OAc)2 and the oxidant F1 are essential for this transformation (Table 2, entry 21 and 22).\nUnder optimal conditions, we next investigated the substrate scope of substrates of benzaldehydes and uorinated alcohols (Scheme 2). Firstly, the substrate scope of the various benzaldehydes was examined for the C(sp2)\u2013H bond triuoroethoxylation. We were delighted to nd that different benzaldehydes bearing the alkyl group, halogen and the electron-rich methoxy group substituents were well tolerated to give the desired products in moderate to good yields (3a\u20133i).\nWhen we changed the placement of the methyl or methoxyl group from the para-position to the meta-position, satisfactory results were also obtained (3b, 3c, 3g and 3h). It is noteworthy that 2-ethylbenzaldehyde also showed reaction activity in spite\nScheme 2 Scope of aldehydes and fluorinated alcohols.a a Reaction conditions: 1 (0.2 mmol), fluorinated alcohols (2 mL), Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol%), A9 (50 mol%), F1 (0.4 mmol), TFA (2 equiv.) and stirred at 80 C for 12 h. All yields given are those for the isolated products.\n18724 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 18722\u201318727\nof the steric hindrance effect, affording the corresponding product in moderate yields (3d). Whereas, strong electrondecient benzaldehydes with ester and nitro substituents only provided trace amounts of the product (3j and 3k). Furthermore, we also screened the other uorinated alcohols under the standard conditions for obtaining uorinated compounds. Gratifyingly, polyuoroalkoxylation of benzaldehyde with other polyuoro-alcohols proceeded smoothly with completely selectivity in moderate yields (3l\u20133n).12 Signicantly, the ortho-C\u2013H di-polyuoroalkoxylation products could not be detected, demonstrating that the transformation showed good selectivity for the mono-uoroalkoxylation. Moreover, 3-methylbenzaldehyde and 3, 4-dimethoxy-benzaldehyde also afforded the corresponding mono-polyuoroalkoxylated products in 49\u201364% yields (3o, 3p and 3s). Notably, secondary uorinated alcohols such as 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexauoro-2-propanol were also effective nucleophiles towards the benzaldehyde with steric hindrance, affording the highly hindered uoroalkyl ethers in 55% isolated yields (3r).\nSince the current reaction conditions were oxidative, we next wondered whether benzylic amines could be oxidized and serve as effective coupling partners for this reaction. Benzylamine instead of benzaldehyde was used as a substrate, and reacted with triuoroethanol under the optimal reaction conditions (Table 3). To our delight, the C\u2013N and ortho-C(sp2)\u2013H consecutive oxidation of benzylamine could also be accomplished in one pot, albeit with lower efficiency (Table 3, entries 1). Upon evaluation of various oxidants, we discovered that although the [F+] bystanding oxidants gave inferior yields of the corresponding products in less than 10% (Table 3, entry 3\u20135), K2S2O8 was identied as potentially effective oxidant for this reaction, affording the desired product in 70% yield (Table 3, entry 2). Interestingly, the reaction with dual oxidant (F1/F4) system"

N-benzyl primary amines having methyl group, halogens and the electron-rich methoxy group on the aromatic ring all underwent the desired oxidation reaction in 45\u201380% yields (Scheme 3, entry 1\u20136). Unfortunately, N-benzyl secondary amines, such as N-methyl-1phenylmethanamine and N-benzylpropan-1-amine, only provided trace amounts of yield, which indicated that the secondary amines are not suitable for this process (Scheme 3, entry 7\u201310). Remarkably, N-benzyl tertiary amines were competent to undergo the reaction in moderate yields (Scheme 3, entry 11\u201317).\nBased on our experiments and related literature,3d,k,6\u20138 a putative mechanism was proposed for the palladium-catalyzed orthoC(sp2)\u2013H oxidation of benzaldehydes (Scheme 4). Benzyl amines get converted into imine intermediate by the [F+] bystanding oxidant, which in turn could be hydrolyzed to the aldehydes. Condensation of benzaldehydes with the ligand 2-(2-aminopropanamido)propanoic acid provides the imine intermediate A. Coordination of this imine to a palladium species followed by cyclopalladation process generates the [5, 5]-bicyclic palladium intermediate C via a site-selective C\u2013H bond activation process, and oxidative addition of the intermediate C with uorinating bystanding oxidant generates the palladium(IV) species D. Next, the uoride anion is displaced by the uorinated alcohol to provide intermediate E. Reductive elimination of this palladium complex followed by a ligand dissociation process provides the aimino amide, which releases the desired product, and ligand 2- (2-aminopropanamido)propanoic acid.\nScheme 4 Proposed mechanism.\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 18722\u201318727 | 18725\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .
