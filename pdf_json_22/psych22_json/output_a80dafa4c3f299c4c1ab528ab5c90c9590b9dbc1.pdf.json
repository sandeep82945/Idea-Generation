Thus, there is an urgent need to develop prevention and intervention measures for clinicians, policymakers, and researchers.\nMethods: Network analysis method was used to analyze the cross-sectional data of Chinese adolescents in this study. The Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A) was used for assessing depression, in which item 9 of the PHQ-A was used to assess suicide ideation, and International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool-Children\u2019s Home Version (ICAST-CH) was used for assessing abuse.\nResults: The prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese adolescents was 21.46% (95% CI, 20.79\u201322.16%). The prevalence of moderate or severe depression was 16.76%, and the prevalence of violence exposure, psychological victimization, neglect, and physical victimization was 33.5%, 59.5%, 28.37%, and 31.51% in the past years, respectively. Network analysis results showed that the most central nodes in the network of abuse and depression were \u201cunimportant,\u201d \u201cnot cared,\u201d and \u201cpushed.\u201d The bridge nodes were \u201csuicidal ideation\u201d and \u201cunimportant.\u201d The nodes \u201csadness,\u201d \u201cfailure,\u201d and \u201cunimportant\u201d explained the largest proportion of the variance of suicidal ideation in our network. Differences were found in the structure of both abuse and depression networks between adolescents with or without suicidal ideation.\nLimitations: The self-reporting\u2013based cross-sectional surveys and community sample groups limit the inference of causality and the generalization of the results.\nConclusion: This study shows that \u201cunimportant\u201d is the central and bridge nodes in the abuse and depression networks and also explains a part of variance of suicidal ideation. The effect of \u201cunimportant\u201d should be considered in the prevention and intervention of depression and suicide in adolescents with abuse experience. Future study is needed to confirm its role in clinical intervention.\nKeywords: adolescents, depression, child abuse, suicide ideation, network analysis\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 1 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 853951"

            "text": "Over 264 million people of different ages suffer from depression globally, which is a leading cause of disability and a major contributor to the global burden of disease (1). Depressive symptoms include changes in moods and psychological behaviors (2), and major depression can contribute to the development of suicidality or affect social functions (3, 4). Depression typically starts in childhood or adolescence, and its prevalence significantly increases in adolescence and slows down and stabilizes till the end of adolescence (5, 6). However, its recurrence rate is high in adulthood (7, 8). Many patients with depression do not receive effective treatment; previous research reported that only 19.5% of patients with major depression receive treatment in China (9). As the main depressive symptoms of adolescents may be quite different from those of adults (7), it is necessary to explore the characteristics of depressive symptoms of adolescents to guide early detection and intervention.\nOne major risk factor of depression is the experience of abuse, which widely exists in people of all ages, ranging from children to the elderly (10, 11). Compared with adults, there is a higher rate of abuse among children, while they are less resilient to it. Although the rate of child abuse in China decreased from 70.1% (12) in 2010 to 42.3\u201362.7% in 2019 (13), it is still much higher than that in Western developed countries (23.5\u201337.4%) (14, 15). Child abuse will not only lead to physical injury but also cause serious psychological trauma and even affect the mental health in adulthood (13, 16). It is reported that childhood abuse is a common cause of depression (17\u201319) and even increases the risk of depression and anxiety in adulthood (20).\nThe previous study reported that parents are responsible for 81% of child abuse, among whom 88% are biological parents (21), which means that family is the primary place where child abuse occurs. This phenomenon may be accounted by the strict education (the so-called \u201ceducation through stick and club\u201d) that is prevalent in China, which means that children will be punished if they are considered not behaving themselves, such as failure in examination, offending guardians, and not being obedient. A previous study has shown that frequent exposure to family abuse is an independent risk factor for depression in adulthood (22). Therefore, research on child abuse in families is helpful and necessary to understand the development of depressive symptoms. Emotional abuse and neglect in children are usually a risk factor of early onset of depression (23). Therefore, the effect of parental psychological abuse on children should be addressed to reduce the risk of depression in adolescents (24). In addition, abuse experience also affects the recovery from depression. Research shows that, during 12 months, the recovery rate of severely depressed women without abuse experience is 3.7 times higher than that of those with abuse experience (25).\nSuicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents (26), and the development of suicidality may be the most serious consequence of depression. The factors contributing to adolescent suicide include psychological factors (such as depression and anxiety), stressful life events (such as family problems and peer conflicts), and personality traits (27). The relationship of depression and anxiety symptoms with suicidal ideation has been explored in our previous study (28). However,\ndepression and anxiety cannot fully explain suicidal ideation; other suicide risk factors are equally important, such as child abuse, which is reported to be directly associated with suicide. A total of 80% of people who attempt suicide have a history of child abuse (29), and abuse increases the risk of suicidal ideation and suicidality (30). A study in Hong Kong, China, shows that child abuse is an important risk factor for attempted suicide, 4.1% of children are hospitalized because of attempted suicide within 5 years after abuse, and the rate of suicide attempt rises to 7.1% within 20 years (31). This evidence shows that child abuse is an important risk factor for suicide. It is necessary to further investigate which type of abuse events has a direct effect on suicide to provide guidance for reducing the risk of suicide.\nNetwork analysis provides a new perspective to understand the relationship between symptoms of psychological disorders and other variables of interest. Many previous studies have explored the relationship between depressive symptoms and other variables through network analysis, such as PTSD (32, 33), eating disorders (34), and negative life events (35). In addition, studies have explored the relationship between depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (36). These studies provide insights into the relationship between depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. However, so far, network analysis has not yet been conducted to investigate the relationship between abuse, depression, and suicidal ideation. Therefore, this study adopts network analysis to explore the network structure of all items of Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A) and International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool-Children\u2019s Home Version (ICAST-CH) in a large sample (n = 13754) of Chinese adolescents, as well as the relationship of abuse events and depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation. It also compares the differences in network structures between adolescents with or without suicidal ideation. The present study aims to identify the association between abuse events and depressive symptoms in adolescents, the potential targets for abuse and depression interventions and different targets of intervention between adolescents with or without suicidal ideation, so as to alleviate depression and reduce suicide risk."

The greater the expected influence of the node is, the more important it would\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 853951\nbe in the network. Moreover, we computed the predictability for each node via R mgm package (42). Predictability means the extent to which the variance of a node can be explained by all of its adjacent nodes.\nThe stability and accuracy of the network were calculated by the R bootnet package (43). First, the bootstrap approach (nBoots = 2,000) was used to evaluate the accuracy of edge weights via computing the 95% CI. The narrower the CI was, the more accurate the estimation of edge weight would be. Second, the case-dropping bootstrap method was used to evaluate the stability of the centrality index via calculating the correlation stability coefficient. The correlation stability coefficient should not be lower than 0.25, preferably higher than 0.50 (43)."

From the perspective of statistics, nodes with higher bridge expected influence in one community have wider and closer connections with nodes in the other community. Thus, nodes with higher bridge expected influence are considered to play more central roles in activating nodes from the opposite community. In this study, all nodes were divided into two communities: one community contained 30 abuse events and the other one contained nine depressive symptoms."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We studied the prevalence of abuse and depression among children and adolescents in China, and the results show that the prevalence of child abuse in China is very high, especially psychological abuse. The prevalence rate is comparable with that of other regions or countries using the same tools, such as\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 6 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 853951\nTaiwan (lifetime prevalence rate of 91% and 1-year prevalence rate of 83%) (46), India (1-year prevalence rate of 89.9%) (47), and Bangladesh (lifetime prevalence of neglect 78% to lifetime psychological abuse 97%) (48). However, the prevalence is slightly higher than that of the nine countries in the Balkan region (e.g., psychological abuse prevalence of 83.2% in Greece) (49, 50). Furthermore, the prevalence rate is higher than that measured with other tools (such as Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, according to which psychological abuse prevalence was 48.1%) (51). Therefore, future work should be focused on laying down unified criteria to facilitate the comparison of results. We also found that the prevalence of depression was also higher than previously reported in the United States (8.7\u201311.3%) (52) and lower than that in Ethiopia (28%) (53) and India (25%) (54). Research shows that adolescents in Confucian countries in Asia have higher levels of depression than those in European countries (55), which may be explained by a higher prevalence of abuse. Indeed, the current results show that abuses of all types are significantly positively correlated with depression. Relevant prevention policies should be formulated to reduce the prevalence of abuse in Asian countries. The current study analyzed the characteristics of abuse event and depression networks of Chinese community adolescents. The score of each item in the questionnaire showed that depression symptoms \u201canhedonia\u201d and \u201cfatigue\u201d and abuse event \u201cscreaming\u201d are the most frequent symptoms. Among depressive symptoms, \u201cfatigue\u201d is the most frequent symptom, consistent with the study by Rice et al.; however, according to them, \u201canhedonia\u201d is the most frequent depressive symptom in adults, not in adolescents (7). The difference might be explained by the fact that the samples in their study were patients with major depression, whereas those in our study were taken from community. However, common symptom also exists between these two kinds of samples, such as \u201cfatigue.\u201d Therefore, the differences and similarities between samples should be considered in adopting prevention and\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 853951\nintervention measures. Among abuse events, \u201cscreaming\u201d is the most frequent. Compared with physical abuse, verbal abuse is often underestimated. In Chinese traditional culture, shouting at children is not considered as a form of child abuse (56) but as a common way of parenting (57). Research shows that parents who suffer from verbal abuse themselves are more likely to use it against their children (58), which may explain the high frequency of verbal abuse. Therefore, education of parents is an effective way to reduce the verbal abuse. Finally, it is worth noting that the rate of \u201csuicide ideation\u201d in the current sample is 21.46%, much higher than that reported in other studies (12%) (36). Although the suicide rate of teenagers has gradually decreased in the past 20 years, suicidal ideation is still widespread (59), which needs further exploration.\nThe expected influence index of the network shows that \u201cunimportant\u201d is the most central node in the network of abuse events and depressive symptoms. Taking the central node as a potential target for intervention might prevent the activating and maintaining of the network of abuse events and depressive symptoms. Therefore, the intervention against \u201cunimportant\u201d\nmay hopefully reduce childhood abuse and alleviate depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents. \u201cUnimportant\u201d is a type of neglect, the prevalence of which varies between different cultures, which is 12.5% in India (47), 37.9% in Saudi Arabia (60), and 26.08% in the current sample, indicating that it is a common phenomenon among teenagers. In addition, the high predictability of \u201cunimportant\u201d (0.61) means that 61% of the variance can be explained by adjacent nodes. The nodes \u201cnot cared\u201d and \u201chelpless,\u201d both belonging to neglect, have the strongest direct connection with \u201cunimportant,\u201d suggesting that lack of care is a serious problem among Chinese teenagers. Indeed, in China, both parents of most families need to work to support the family. In particular, some parents need to go out to work for a long time; therefore, they cannot spare enough time for taking care of their children and attending to their emotional need, leading to the development of emotional neglect symptoms of the children.\nIn addition, we found some edges with strong links, which exist within each community, rather than between the communities, similar to the results of previous research (28,\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 8 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 853951\nFIGURE 5 | Flow network of suicide ideation.\n35, 61\u201364). The edges with strong links in the community of abuse events include death wish\u2013abandon (weight = 0.32), not cared\u2013unimportant (weight = 0.32), and hit with hand\u2013 hit with object (weight = 0.30). The strongest links in the community of depressive symptoms were sleeping\u2013appetite (weight = 0.22) and safety\u2013failure (weight = 0.21). Although the strongest edges do not exist across two communities, we found a very important edge between abuse events and depressive symptoms: \u201cunimportant\u201d\u2013\u201csuicide ideation\u201d (weight = 0.11). In the current network, the edge with the strongest link in the depressive symptoms is different from that in the previous study on depression network, which found that the edges with strong links were \u201csad mood\u201d\u2013\u201canhedonia\u201d or \u201cenergy\u201d\u2013 \u201cfatigue\u201d (61, 62). However, our results are similar to those of Wasil et al. (65), who found that \u201csleep\u201d\u2013\u201cappetite\u201d is the most strongly linked edge among depressive symptoms. These differences may be explained by the fact that the first two studies adopted clinical samples (61, 62), whereas the current study and the study of Wasil et al. adopted community adolescents as samples (65). Sleep problems and weight changes are the main physical symptoms of depression in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM5) (66), indicating that contagion of somatic symptoms may exist among community adolescents. The strongest link across two communities is \u201cunimportant\u201d\u2013\u201dsuicide ideation,\u201d which has rarely been discussed in previous studies. \u201cUnimportant\u201d is a type of neglect. As it has been shown that emotional neglect is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation (67), and this association is regulated by depressive symptoms (68), we considered that \u201cunimportant\u201d may arouse feelings similar to the depressive symptom \u201cworthless,\u201d resulting in \u201csuicide ideation\u201d (indirect pathways), which warrants further study in the future. In addition, to explore the bridge nodes in the abuse event and depression symptom networks, we use the bridge expected influence as an observation index. Nodes with higher expected influence are considered to play more central roles in activating nodes from the opposite community. Thus, intervention against bridge nodes may prevent or reduce the activation from one\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 9 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 853951\ncommunity to the other community. We found two bridge nodes in the current network: depression symptom \u201csuicide ideation\u201d and abuse event \u201cunimportant.\u201d This indicates that intervention on \u201cunimportant\u201d may more effectively prevent or reduce the activation of depression symptoms.\nThe results of flow network show that there are 20 directly linked edges and 18 indirectly linked edges. Similar to the results of previous research (28, 36), all nodes in the network have a direct or indirect association with \u201csuicide ideation,\u201d supporting that \u201csuicide ideation\u201d is a highly complex phenomenon (69). In the current network, 48% of the variance of \u201csuicide ideation\u201d can be explained by adjacent nodes. The nodes directly and strongly linked to \u201csuicide ideation\u201d are depression symptoms \u201csadness\u201d and \u201cfailure\u201d and abuse event \u201cunimportant.\u201d The depressive symptoms directly associated with suicidal ideation are similar to those reported by previous studies (70), whereas the direct association between abuse event \u201cunimportant\u201d and suicidal ideation has not been explored previously. Previous studies show that neglect in early life can increase depression and anxiety symptoms and has a significant indirect effect on suicidal ideation (71, 72), and our results extend the finding by showing that certain types of neglect can also affect suicidal ideation directly. Our findings may provide more clues for suicide prevention and support the contribution of abuse to suicide risk. According to the three step-theory of suicide (73), suicidal ideation is the first step of suicide. Early intervention against \u201csadness,\u201d \u201cfailure,\u201d and \u201cunimportant\u201d may be significant in suicide prevention clinically.\nFinally, we compare the differences between adolescents with or without suicidal ideation in the network of abuse events and depressive symptoms. We found significant differences in the network structure, rather than the global strength, suggesting that there are differences in the main symptoms and the interaction between the two groups with or without suicide ideation. The results showed that the central nodes in the network of those with suicidal ideation were \u201cunimportant\u201d and \u201cabandon,\u201d whereas the central nodes of those without suicidal ideation were \u201cpushed\u201d and \u201cunimportant.\u201d Therefore, \u201cunimportant\u201d is the most important node in the network of those with suicidal ideation, whereas its role is weakened in the network of those without suicidal ideation. This may further support that \u201cunimportant\u201d has an important effect on suicidal ideation. The above results might suggest different targets of intervention for adolescents with or without suicidal ideation. Therefore, it is important to clarify whether adolescents have suicidal ideation to adopt more effective intervention measures.\nIn summary, to reduce the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents, we can adopt the following measures: First, strengthening education of parents to reduce the prevalence of child and adolescent abuse. For example, the parents should be taught the appropriate parenting ways instead of abuse. Second, paying attention to the effect of neglect (e.g., abuse events \u201cunimportant\u201d and \u201cnot cared\u201d) on depression of children and adolescents. To attend to the children\u2019s emotional need, the parents need to spend more time with their children and engage in parent\u2013child interaction (including communication) to improve parent\u2013child relationship and alleviate depression as well as anxiety, which is highly\ncomorbid with depression (74). Third, intervening against the depressive symptoms \u201csad mood,\u201d \u201cfailure,\u201d and abuse event \u201cunimportant\u201d to prevent suicidal ideation. For example, adolescents can be encouraged to participate in more physical activities, which is helpful to prevent and treat depression (75, 76). This is particularly important in China, where examoriented education is prevailing. Moreover, adopting targeted measures for adolescents with suicidal ideation. For example, schools can set up counseling rooms or initiate mental health activities, which can offer prevention and intervention measures for those with suicidal ideation. Studies have shown that conducting Empowering a Multimodal Pathway Toward Health Youth (EMPATHY) can effectively reduce suicidal ideation, depression and anxiety (77). The prevention of depression and suicide in children and adolescents needs policy support and the participation of more people concerned. It is necessary to develop a more comprehensive, safe, and effective long-term plan in the future."

Third, because the data were collected from a single region in Chongqing of China, the results of this study may not be generalizable to the adolescents in other regions.

The abuse events \u201cunimportant,\u201d \u201cnot cared,\u201d and \u201cpushed\u201d have the highest expected influence centrality in the network. We also found that \u201csuicidal ideation\u201d and \u201cunimportant\u201d are the bridge nodes of the network. A total of 20 nodes including \u201csadness,\u201d \u201cfailure,\u201d and \u201cunimportant\u201d are directly connected with suicidal ideation. There are differences in network structure between adolescents with or without suicidal ideation.
