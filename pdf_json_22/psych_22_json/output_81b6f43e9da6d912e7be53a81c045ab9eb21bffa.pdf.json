    "abstractText": "This paper draws from the recent literature on psychological richness of life (PRL), conceptualized as a third dimension of a good life which would be particularly desirable when happiness or meaning in life cannot be satisfactory attained, to investigate whether recovering from a COVID infection could be associated with PRL. We hypothesize that people who have recovered from being infected by the virus rate their PRL higher than those who have not been infected. Two cross-sectional studies (n = 937, and n = 1,012) support the hypothesis, and also found that people who recovered from a COVID infection were less prone to want to delete the pandemic time period from their life line and reported lower levels of death anxiety. The findings have implications for coping both on a societal and individual level, by changing perspectives and valuing the richness of positive as well as negative experiences, as well as counteracting repetitiveness and tedium and stimulating new experiences and reflection. The findings also have implications for future research on well-being, which could be informed by expanding the perspective from living well to a life well-lived, and future research on PRL and coping in terms of investigating causalities and interaction effects.",

However, research suggests that these dimensions of life have been particularly hard to achieve during the COVID pandemic. Recent studies have found that happiness has decreased on average compared to before the pandemic (e.g., Greyling et\u00a0al., 2021; Lin et\u00a0al., 2021; Rossouw et\u00a0al., 2021; VanderWeele et\u00a0 al., 2021). There is a growing body of research on how quarantine-related factors, such as boredom (Brooks et\u00a0 al., 2020), decreased physical activity (e.g., Dahlen et\u00a0 al., 2021), work-life boundary-blurring (Pluut and Wonders, 2020), loneliness (e.g., Stieger et\u00a0al., 2021), and financial worry (e.g., Bono et\u00a0 al., 2020), have all been found to impact negatively on people\u2019s happiness, as have, of course, fear of and worry about being infected by the virus (e.g., Lee et\u00a0 al., 2020). Recent studies have also found average perceptions of meaning in life to be\u00a0 lower during the pandemic compared to before (e.g., Arslan and Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, 2021; Chasson et\u00a0 al., 2021; Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and G\u00fcler, 2021). A growing body of research details how pandemic-related factors, such as\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 785224\nshattered goals (e.g., de Jong et\u00a0 al., 2020), inability to make best use of one\u2019s time (Martinelli et\u00a0 al., 2020), and stress (e.g., Schnell and Krampe, 2020), impact negatively on people\u2019s perceived meaning in life.\nHowever, the recent literature suggests that there is a third dimension of a good life, alongside happiness and meaning, conceptualized as a psychologically rich life (e.g., Besser and Oishi, 2020; Oishi and Westgate, 2021). This dimension is defined as a life characterized by a variety of interesting and perspective-changing experiences (Oishi and Westgate, 2021), which need not be\u00a0 positively valenced and can even be\u00a0unpleasant, to be\u00a0contrasted with a boring and monotonous life defined by routines that just are not that interesting (Besser and Oishi, 2020). While less desirable than a happy or meaningful life, recent research has found that psychological richness does indeed contribute to people\u2019s perceptions of a good life (Oishi et\u00a0al., 2020) and would be\u00a0particularly valuable when happiness and meaning cannot be\u00a0 achieved (Oishi et\u00a0 al., 2019).\nContrary to the other two dimensions, the psychological richness of life (PRL) has not yet been subject to study during the recent pandemic. This is the aim of the present paper. More specifically, it focuses on the relationship between recovering from a COVID infection and PRL. We\u00a0 believe that a COVID infection would fit the definition of a psychologically rich experience. Not previously experienced in our lifetime, unpredictable, and with a multitude of potential symptoms (e.g., Norton et\u00a0 al., 2021; Tsang et\u00a0 al. 2021), it would likely be\u00a0 a dramatic and perspective-changing experience and upset any boredom and monotony imposed by the pandemic. The question seems highly relevant, considering the fact that this experience would be\u00a0 potentially shared by more than 260 million people worldwide who have recovered from a COVID infection to date (WHO, 2022, Worldometers 2022).\nWe test our main hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between recovering from a COVID infection and psychological richness in life, in two cross-sectional online studies. In study 1, a convenience sample of 937 Swedes, we\u00a0 also investigated perceived PRL change and whether people who recovered from a COVID infection would be\u00a0 less prone to erase the pandemic time-period from their lives (and explored their underlying motivations for this decision). In study 2, a survey of a nationrepresentative sample of 1,012 Swedes, we\u00a0replicate the findings from study 1 and also test the hypothesis that people who recovered from a COVID infection experience less death anxiety."

            "heading": "THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: A GOOD LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RICHNESS",
            "text": "A survey of almost 4,000 people in nine different countries in North America, Asia, Africa, and Europe, found that between 50 and 70% percent would describe their ideal life as happy, while between 25 and 38% would describe it as meaningful (Oishi et\u00a0 al., 2020). Happiness and meaning have been subject to study as two dimensions of well-being for decades (for a review, see Diener et\u00a0al., 2018). Happiness represents a dimension of hedonic or subjective well-being (e.g., Diener et\u00a0 al., 1999),\nand meaning in life represents a dimension of eudaimonic or psychological well-being (e.g., Ryan and Deci, 2001), whereas well-being is conceptualized as optimal psychological experience and functioning (Deci and Ryan, 2008), or the feeling or belief that life is going well (Diener et\u00a0 al., 2018).\nHowever, optimal psychological experience and functioning might not be\u00a0 possible for everyone to attain (e.g., Lachman and Weaver, 1998; Wrosch et\u00a0 al., 2003). Circumstances might not allow for a happy life, characterized by stability, safety, comfort, and pleasantness (e.g., Oishi et\u00a0 al., 2019; Besser and Oishi, 2020). Similarly, a meaningful life, characterized by purpose, structure, and the exercise of one\u2019s capacities (e.g., Oishi et\u00a0 al., 2019; Besser and Oishi, 2020), might also not be\u00a0allowed by circumstances. In lack of happiness and meaning, can people still perceive that they live a good life?\nConceived of as a life well lived (Oishi and Westgate, 2021), a good life expands on the definition of well-being to allow for the possibility of living a desirable life even when life is not going well. A good life would be\u00a0 possible to attain not only by way of happiness or meaning, but also when life is rich with experiences that are not necessarily pleasant or purposeful. Indeed, the survey by Oishi et\u00a0 al. (2020) found that between 9 and 17% percent of people would describe their ideal life in terms of what the authors conceptualize as a psychologically rich life, characterized by a variety of challenging, surprising, dramatic, and perspective-shifting events (e.g., Oishi et\u00a0 al., 2019; Besser and Oishi, 2020).\nAs argued by Besser and Oishi (2020), the nice thing about a psychologically rich life (PRL) is that, conversely to a happy life or a meaningful life, it is an accessible one which can be\u00a0 attained in a number of different ways. Willingly and deliberately, but also unwillingly and not deliberately (Oishi and Westgate, 2021). For example, a 14-day diary study found that people who had made some kind of excursion or spontaneous trip during the time period rated higher on PRL, and a study comparing students taking a semester abroad vs. staying on campus found a positive correlation between the former groups higher frequency of novel unusual experiences and their higher PRL ratings (Oishi et\u00a0 al., 2020b). In a survey of people who had just exited an escape room, those who managed to \u201cescape\u201d rated higher on happiness and meaning than those who failed, but their PRL ratings were unrelated to the outcome (Oishi and Westgate, 2021). Instead, PRL ratings increased with the perceived difficulty (and likelihood of not escaping). Oishi and Westgate (2021) also report on a series of studies where coders who were blind to the hypotheses rated obituaries higher on PRL (while simultaneously lower on happiness) when they contained drama and misfortunes.\nIndeed, a psychologically rich life could be\u00a0 construed as a good life, even lacking happiness and meaning, when a person would be\u00a0 able to say on their deathbed, \u201cI had an interesting life,\u201d or that their life would make a good novel or movie (Oishi et\u00a0 al., 2019).\nIt is well established that the two dimensions of well-being, happiness, and meaning, overlap to some extent, but are still unique and discriminantly valid constructs (e.g., Diener et\u00a0 al., 2018). Similarly, the three dimensions of a good life overlap\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 785224\nto some extent but are still unique and discriminantly valid concepts. In the previously mentioned global survey of people\u2019s ideal lives, happiness and meaning correlated in the range of 0.23\u20130.68 across countries, whereas happiness and PRL correlations ranged between \u22120.11 and 0.51 and meaning and PRL correlations ranged between 0.34 and 0.59. In a test of their psychometric properties, Oishi and Westgate (2021) found that two-factor models where happiness, meaning, and PRL were combined in different ways produced a goodness of fit in the range of 0.7 to 0.9 across studies, but only the threefactor model (where happiness, meaning, and PRL were separated) produced a goodness of fit in the higher 0.9 s and did so consistently across studies. In a repeated measures study, Oishi et\u00a0 al. (2019) similarly found that the items used to measure PRL had discriminant validity across time versus the other two dimensions.\nApplying the three dimensions of a good life to the COVID pandemic, recent studies have found that lockdowns, quarantines, restrictions, and fear of the virus have had detrimental effects on both happiness and meaningfulness, as briefly reviewed in this paper\u2019s introduction. However, PRL has not yet been studied in light of the pandemic. We\u00a0 hypothesize that there is a positive relationship between PRL and recovering from a COVID infection.\nHYPOTHESIS 1: A POSITIVE"

            "text": "While previous studies have investigated the indirect relationships between happiness, meaning and the pandemic (through restrictions, living conditions, and reactions such as stress) to the best of our knowledge, only one published study has associated well-being directly with the COVID virus. In that study, Dahlen and Thorbj\u00f8rnsen (2021) found a positive relationship between recovering from a COVID infection and perceived meaning in life. We\u00a0 expect a similarly positive relationship between recovering from a COVID infection and PRL.\nA three-fold argument could be\u00a0 made for this hypothesis. First, a COVID infection, unprecedented with its unpredictability and multitude of symptoms (e.g., Norton et\u00a0 al., 2021; Tsang et\u00a0al., 2021), would fit well with the construal of a psychologically rich experience as challenging, surprising, and perspective shifting, breaking the tedium and monotony of pandemic life, and potentially adding drama and stories to one\u2019s life narrative (e.g., Oishi and Westgate, 2021). Second, perceiving life as psychologically rich could be\u00a0a way to cope with the infection. This would resonate with previous studies on happinessmindfulness (e.g., Carreno et\u00a0 al., 2021), meaning-centered coping (e.g., Polizzi et\u00a0 al., 2020; Lin, 2021; Eisenbeck et\u00a0 al., 2022), and psychological flexibility (e.g., Kashdan and Rottenberg, 2010; Arslan et\u00a0 al., 2020; Arslan and Allen, 2021), which have found that people who deliberately impose meaning into the experience, or redefine it as adding some kind of value to life, are more resilient to the negative effects of the pandemic.\nBy this logic, perceiving the infection as psychologically rich would add to, rather than subtract from, a good life, and be\u00a0 particularly necessary in this directly (vis-\u00e1-vis indirectly for those not infected) threatening situation. In other words, the positive association could potentially be\u00a0with both (absolute level) PRL and perceived change in PRL. Third, as PRL and meaning are overlapping to some extent, and perceived meaning in life has been found to have a positive relationship with recovering from a COVID infection (Dahlen and Thorbj\u00f8rnsen 2021), we\u00a0 would expect PRL to have a similarly positive relationship with recovering from a COVID infection. Therefore, we\u00a0 hypothesize:\nH1: People who have recovered from a COVID infection rate their psychological richness of life higher compared to those who have not been infected with the virus.\nHYPOTHESIS 2: A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RECOVERING FROM A COVID INFECTION AND PRONENESS TO ERASE THE PANDEMIC TIME-PERIOD\nWe hypothesize that people who recovered from a COVID infection would be\u00a0 less prone to erase the pandemic timeperiod from their lifeline, if given the choice, compared to those who have not been infected by the virus. As found in the reviewed studies, the pandemic time period has taken much from people\u2019s lives, for example, in terms of stability, safety, comfort and pleasantness (which would otherwise contribute to a happy life), in terms of purpose, structure and the ability to live up to one\u2019s full capacity (which would otherwise contribute to a meaningful life), and potentially also in terms of experiences and variation due to restrictions (which would otherwise contribute to a psychologically rich life). Consequently, it seems plausible that many would rather erase it from their lifeline. However, compared to those who have not been infected and directly impacted by the virus, those who recovered from a COVID infection would be\u00a0 more likely to perceive that the pandemic time period has enriched their lives, in terms of, for example, challenge, intense experiences, new perspective and a story to their life narrative, and it seems reasonable to expect that they would therefore be\u00a0 less prone to erase it from their lifeline.\nIn fact, if recovering from a COVID infection has a positive relationship with PRL and PRL is a dimension of good life, which by definition is a life worth living (Oishi and Westgate, 2021), the logical extension would be\u00a0 that the time-period of the COVID infection would be\u00a0 worth keeping on the lifeline. Therefore, we\u00a0 hypothesize:\nH2: People who have recovered from a COVID infection would be\u00a0les\\s prone to erase the pandemic time-period from their lifeline compared to those who have not been infected with the virus.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 785224"

Would it, for example, be\u00a0 because they regret the lower level of PRL, or because other, negative, motivations become more salient in the absence of a higher level of PRL? In other words, are the motivations for erasing the time-period the same as for not erasing it, or do they differ? The answer to this question would inform our understanding both of pandemic coping and of PRL.

These themes also came in several different variations and overall seem to revolve around what the pandemic has added to life.\nThe coders also noted that the replies related to erasing the pandemic time-period often seemed more general (particularly the negative impact theme, which often included references to society and others), whereas those related to not erasing often seemed more personal (references to oneself in all three themes, but particularly the experience and drama themes). Testing this notion, the replies were coded as general or personal (or non-specified) and subjected to a Chi-square test. General references were more common in the replies related to erasing the pandemic time-period (49%) than in the replies related to not erasing (34%), whereas the opposite pattern was found for personal references (41% vs. 55%), Chi-square (1, 531) = 25.35, p < 0.001."

            "text": "In support of our main hypothesis, people who had recovered from a COVID infection rated higher on PRL compared to those who had not been infected by the virus (and also in comparison with those who started or finished vaccination). Adding a measure of perceived PRL change, we\u00a0 found that the latter two groups on average perceived that their PRL had decreased during the pandemic, whereas those who had recovered from a COVID infection on average perceived their PRL to remain the same.\nIn support of our second hypothesis, those who had recovered from a COVID infection were significantly less prone to delete the pandemic time-period from their lifeline than the group that had not been infected. An additional test showed an interaction effect with PRL change, whereby those who experienced an increase in PRL were more prone to keep the time-period compared to those who experienced a decrease in PRL.\nThe main themes that emerged in our exploratory analysis of the open-ended answers seemingly resonate with the findings. Those who would rather not delete the pandemic time-period from their lifeline, generally associated it with perspective, experience and drama, themes that would presumably increase PRL. Those who, on the other hand, would rather delete the pandemic time-period from their lifeline, generally associated it isolation and tedium, themes that would presumably decrease PRL. But the major theme in this group, negative impact, did not relate to PRL. A potential explanation for this would be\u00a0that a lower level of PRL made other, negative aspects of the pandemic more salient. Additional coding suggested that the motivations to not erase the pandemic time-period seemed to be\u00a0 more related to people\u2019s perceptions of their own lives, whereas the motivations to erase it also related to the general (negative) effects of the pandemic.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 785224\nWhile the findings support our hypotheses, the study was limited to a convenience sample recruited via social media. We\u00a0 therefore conducted a second study to replicate the test of our main hypothesis on a demographically representative sample that was recruited via a national panel, and which enabled us to gauge and include age, sex, level of education and income as covariates. This study also tested the additional hypothesis that those who recovered from a COVID infection would rate lower on death anxiety than those who have not been infected with the virus.\nSTUDY 2\nHypothesis 3: A Negative Relationship Between Recovering From a COVID Infection and Death Anxiety Studies across the globe, for example, in the USA (Lee et\u00a0 al., 2020), China (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020), Pakistan (Shakil et\u00a0al., 2022), and Europe (Erquicia et\u00a0 al., 2020), have identified increasing death anxiety as a major issue during the COVID pandemic. An argument could be\u00a0 made that death anxiety is, in fact, the root cause of all other factors related to the pandemic, as restrictions on societal and group levels with all its consequences, and precautions on an individual level with its various effects, fundamentally stem from a fear that people would otherwise die (Pyszczynski et\u00a0al., 2020). Whether people contract the virus or not, the pandemic comprises a contagion of mortality (Courtney et\u00a0 al., 2020). Research on previous pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu (e.g., Prati et\u00a0al., 2011), SARS (e.g., Fung and Carstensen, 2006), and the Ebola epidemic (e.g., Arrowood et\u00a0 al., 2017), has found similar increases in mortality salience and resulting death anxiety.\nWe hypothesize that there is a negative relationship between recovering from a COVID infection and death anxiety. In other words, those who recovered from a COVID infection would rate lower on death anxiety than those who have not been infected with the virus. Recovering from being actually infected by the virus would likely be\u00a0 a relief from worry about dying from it. But the construal of PRL as a life well-lived\u2014one that would make for good stories, a good movie, or even a good obituary\u2014also suggests that a higher PRL (which was associated with recovering from an infection in Study 1) would potentially mitigate worry about life ending prematurely, at least to some extent.\nThis argument would resonate with terror management theory, which postulates that mortality salience is associated with increased needs for self-esteem and literal or symbolic immortality to mitigate death anxiety (e.g., Greenberg et\u00a0 al., 1994; Pyszczynski et\u00a0 al., 1999). The literal immortality coping route would mean simply downplaying or denying the threat (Juhl and Routledge, 2016). The symbolic immortality coping route could manifest in, for example, religious activity (e.g., Vail et\u00a0 al., 2010), curiosity (Fitri et\u00a0 al., 2020), or meaning (e.g., Taubman-Ben-Ari, 2011). An argument could be\u00a0 made that PRL would fit within this route as well, being a life welllived that would carry on in the form of good stories or even TA B LE \u00a02 | D iff er en ce s in P R L an d pr op\nen si\nty to\ne ra\nse th\ne pa\nnd em\nic ti\nm e-\npe rio\nd (m\nea n\nco m\npa ris\non t-\nte st\ns, S\ntu dy\n1 ).\nR ec\no ve\nre d\nf ro\nm\nC O\nV ID\nin fe\nct io\nn N\no t\nin fe\nct ed\nt p\nC oh\nen \u2019s\nd\nS ta\nrt ed\no r\nfi ni\nsh ed\nva\ncc in\nat io\nn t\np C\noh en\n\u2019s d\nC h\nisq\nu ar\ne\nM S\nD M\nS D\nM S\nD\nP R\nL 6.\n28 1.\n52 5.\n66 1.\n74 4.\n05 0.\n00 1\n0. 38\n5. 84\n1. 63\n2. 64\n0. 00\n5 0. 28 P R L ch an ge \u2212 0. 32 1. 99 \u2212 0. 90 1. 83 3. 10 0. 00 1 0. 30 \u2212 0. 97 1. 77 3. 17 0. 00 1 0. 35 P ro po rt io n w ho w ou ld e ra se pa nd em ic ti m epe rio d fro m th ei r liv es 15 .0 % 46 .9 % 37 .4 % 15\n.2 0\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 785224\na good obituary.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Our two studies find a positive relationship between recovering from a COVID infection and PRL, in support of the main hypothesis. People who had recovered from a COVID infection rated both their perceived change in PRL and their absolute level of PRL higher, compared to those who had not been infected by the virus. The finding that the average perceived change in PRL was negative in the latter group, but not in the former, suggests that perceiving life as psychologically rich could be\u00a0a way of coping with the infection, similar to meaningcentered coping (e.g., Polizzi et\u00a0 al., 2020; Karata\u015f et\u00a0 al. 2021; Lin, 2021; Eisenbeck et\u00a0 al., 2022) and psychological flexibility (e.g., Arslan et\u00a0 al., 2020; Arslan and Allen, 2021). The finding that recovered people also rated their absolute level PRL higher on average suggests that a COVID infection could potentially be\u00a0 construed as a psychologically rich experience (cf. Oishi and Westgate, 2021).\nIn support of the second hypothesis, those who had recovered from a COVID infection were also less prone to erase the pandemic time-period from their lifeline. This finding fits the conceptualization of PRL as a dimension of good life, which, by definition, is a life worth living (Oishi and Westgate, 2021). Our exploratory analysis of the participants\u2019 open-ended replies found that the main motivations for keeping the pandemic time-period on the lifeline centered on ways in which it seemingly added to and enriched life.\nTABLE\u00a04 | Motivations to erase the pandemic time-period or not from one\u2019s lifeline, Study 1.\nErase pandemic time-period\nYes No\nThemes Negative impact (44%)\n\u201cLost my job\u201d \u201cSo many people have died\u201d \u201cMany bad things have happened because of it\u201d\nPerspective (41%) \u201cGave me time and reason to reflect\u201d \u201cI have learned much about myself\u201d \u201cChanged my outlook on many things\u201d\nIsolation (20%) \u201cIsolation and loneliness\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t been able to meet friends and family\u201d \u201cNo social life\u201d\nExperience (38%) \u201cA life experience\u201d \u201cI experienced things I\u00a0never thought I\u00a0would\u201d \u201cIt has enriched me in some ways\u201d\nTedium (16%) \u201cLife has been put on pause\u201d \u201cCannot travel or do anything\u201d \u201cBoring!\u201d\nDrama (11%) \u201cLife is less boring when it does not stick to the same old track\u201d \u201cScary but also exciting to see what happens\u201d \u201cIt shook things up for me\u201d\nOther (20%) \u201cSome things were good, but the bad things outweigh\u201d \u201cOther bad things happened in my life\u201d \u201cSick of reading all the doomsday news\u201d\nOther (10%) \u201cI know it was bad for others, but made my life seem less gloomy\u201d \u201cI do not believe in regrets\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no changing history\u201d\nD ahlen and Thorbj\u00f8rnsen\nP R L: A C O VID S ilver Lining?\nFrontiers in P sychology | w w w .frontiersin.org 9\nA pril 2022 | Volum e 13 | A rticle 785224\nTABLE\u00a05 | Differences in PRL and death anxiety (mean comparison t-tests, Study 2).\nRecovered from COVID infection\nNot infected t p Cohen\u2019s d\nStarted or finished vaccination\nt p Cohen\u2019s d\nM SD M SD M SD\nPRL 6.77 1.59 6.40 1.87 2.42 0.008 0.21 6.51 1.74 1.53 0.06 0.16 Death anxiety 4.89 2.31 5.43 2.38 2.51 0.007 0.23 5.39 2.37 2.08 0.01 0.21\nTABLE\u00a06 | Differences in PRL and death anxiety (Mann\u2013Whitney U tests, Study 2).\nRecovered from COVID infection\nNot infected U z p\nStarted or finished vaccination\nU z p\nn Mdn n Mdn n Mdn\nPRL 143 6.83 601 6.40 37508.00 \u22122.37 0.009 258 6.67 16715.50 \u22121.56 0.06 Death anxiety 143 4.67 603 5.00 48732.50 2.43 0.008 258 5.00 20986.50 2.15 0.02\nMdn = median.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 785224\nIn support of the third hypothesis, those who had recovered from a COVID infection reported lower death anxiety.

            "heading": "Implications",
            "text": "Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on well-being during the COVID pandemic. While happiness and meaning during the pandemic have been subject to growing bodies of the literature, PRL has not previously received research attention. While the pandemic, with its many restrictions and indirect effects on people\u2019s lives, may overall decrease the richness of life, similar to how happiness and meaning decrease, the PRL perspective gives reason to study the direct effect of being infected by the virus as an undesired and negative experience that could nevertheless enrich life. Our findings also contribute to the nascent literature on PRL by putting it in the pandemic context, a current and global phenomenon, to which everyone can relate, and which can have both positive and associations with people\u2019s psychological richness of life.\nTurning to implications, the notion that a good life can manifest even without happiness and meaning, suggests that there are other aspects of wellbeing to monitor and stimulate, both on societal and individual levels, when stability, comfort, and freedom cannot be\u00a0promoted or attained. These can be\u00a0simple things, such as counteracting repetitiveness and tedium and stimulating new experiences and reflection. But it would also include the fundamental realization that undesired and unpleasant events and experiences can be\u00a0 construed as valuable, enriching, parts of life\u2014in hindsight, or even as they unfold.\nOne important function of a psychologically rich life is to cope with tragedy and negative experiences. By valuing both positive and negative life events, obtaining new perspectives on life, people may find value in experiences that are not necessarily positive or meaningful. In the same manner as people value sad or scary movies, negative and stressful lifeevents such as a COVID infection may foster discovery and learning, combat boredom and provide people with vivid memories and more varied lives."

            "heading": "Summary and Limitations",
            "text": "In summary, our two cross-sectional online studies find a positive relationship between recovering from a COVID infection and PRL. In the first study, a convenience sample of Swedes recruited via Facebook, those who reported having recovered from a COVID\ninfection rated their PRL and perceived change in PRL higher than those who reported that they had not been infected, controlling for age and sex. Moreover, a lower percentage in the former versus latter group reported that they would erase the pandemic time-period from their lifeline if they could. In the second study, a nation-representative panel sample of Swedes, those who reported having recovered from a COVID infection rated their PRL higher and their death anxiety lower than those who reported that they had not been infected, controlling for age, sex, level of education, and income. It is important to note that the cross-sectional and correlational designs of study 1 and 2 do not allow for determining causal effects. The group division was based on participants\u2019 selfreports of having recovered from a COVID infection or of never being infected. PRL and death anxiety were measured at the same (single) time, allowing only a \u201csnapshot view\u201d of the relationship. As PRL is not yet a well-established dimension of a good life, it has not been subject to tracking over time (similar to happiness and meaning), and therefore, it was not possible to obtain pre-pandemic measures for comparison and analysis of dynamic effects. To this end, future studies are needed, using additional methodological approaches such as longitudinal designs or experiments, and preferably using clinical test data rather than self-reports of COVID status. While controlling for age, sex, education, and income, the analyses in the present studies were limited to two small samples of Swedes. Future research would be\u00a0 informed by larger samples, which take potential moderating effects of demographic and socioeconomic variables, as well as national differences into account."
