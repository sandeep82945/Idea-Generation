Experiment 1 used the rapid parallel visual presentation (RPVP) paradigm with postcued identification of one word in a five-word sequence. The sequence could be grammatically correct (e.g., \u201cthe boy likes his bike\u201d) or be an ungrammatical reordering of the same words (e.g., \u201chis boy the bike likes the\u201d). We replicated the standard sentence superiority effect (more accurate identification of target words when embedded in a grammatically correct sequence compared with ungrammatical sequences), and also found that lowercase presentation led to higher word identification accuracy, but equally so for the grammatical and ungrammatical sequences. This pattern suggests that the lowercase advantage was mostly operating at the level of individual word identification. The following three experiments used the grammatical decision task to provide an examination of letter case effects on more global sentence processing measures. All these experiments revealed a significant lowercase advantage in grammatical decisions, independently of the nature of the ungrammatical sequence (Experiments 2 and 3) and independently of whether or not the letter case manipulation was blocked (Experiment 4). The size of the effects observed in grammatical decisions again points to individual word identification as the primary locus of the lowercase advantage. We conclude that letter case mainly affects early visuo-orthographic processing and access to case-independent letter and word identities.\nKeywords: grammatical decisions, letter case, reading, sentence superiority\nThere is a long-standing debate on whether or not letter case (lowercase vs. UPPERCASE)1 has a significant impact on the ease with which skilled readers process single words. Given that most reading involves text with lowercase letters, one might have expected that reading words printed in lowercase would be much easier than reading words printed in uppercase. However, evidence from the single word reading literature remains ambiguous at present, although it should be mentioned that relatively few studies have actually focused on the basic lower vs. uppercase comparison. For example, Paap et al.\u2019s (1984) influential study examined the impact of shape frequency (the pattern of ascending, descending, and neutral letters: e.g., t, g, and n, respectively) on the processing\nJonathan Grainger https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6737-5646 Before starting the experiment, participants accepted an online informed-consent form.

This study was supported by Grant 742141 from the European Research Council (ERC). The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nof lowercase text and found no evidence for an impact of this variable. On the other hand, in a comparison of lowercase and uppercase presentation, Perea and Rosa (2002) did find a significant lowercase advantage in a lexical-decision task (in response times [RTs]), but only for relatively unfamiliar words. Moreover, when measured as a percentage of average RT (averaged across the lowercase and uppercase conditions) the effect was rather small (2.45%). This lowercase advantage in single word lexical decision in Spanish was replicated by Vergara-Mart\u00ednez et al. (2020), but again the size of the effect was small (1.99%). Contrary to those findings, however, L\u00e9t\u00e9 and Pynte (2003) failed to find a lowercase advantage in a lexical-decision task in French but did find that shape frequency modulated performance to lowercase words.\nEvidence from sentence reading, on the other hand, is relatively unambiguous. Early studies (e.g., Tinker, 1955, 1963; Tinker & Paterson, 1928) reported a sizable advantage (close to 14%) in reading times for sentences written in lowercase compared with uppercase text. In his influential book on text legibility, Tinker (1963) explained this lowercase advantage by the pattern of ascending/descending letters in lowercase words providing some useful \u201ccharacteristic word forms\u201d (p. 34), thus making them easier to read than uppercase words. However, as noted above, this explanation was\nAll data and materials are available at osf.io/m3y2z (Fournet et al., 2022).

(1984). Furthermore, recent research (Perea et al., 2017) has shown that the lowercase advantage in total reading times is smaller than those early estimates. One possible reason for the larger lowercase advantage in the early studies by Tinker and colleagues is that they used fonts that were not monospaced, so that uppercase words occupied more horizontal space than lowercase words. Notably, when measuring eye-movement patterns on a single target word embedded in a sentence, Perea et al. (2017) found a sizable lowercase advantage (9.57%) on gaze durations (i.e., the sum of eye fixations on the target stimulus), but this advantage was much smaller (2.23%) on first-fixation durations (i.e., first of several fixations on the word) and single-fixation durations (3.44%). Of note, the lowercase advantage did not increase when considering the total fixation time (i.e., including those fixations resulting from regressions) on the target word (9.62%).\nIn the present study, we first examined the extent to which letter case impacts on the sentence superiority effect (Snell & Grainger, 2017). According to Perea et al. (2017), the lowercase advantage seen in gaze durations during sentence reading points to individual word identification processes as the locus of the effect. We should therefore find a lowercase advantage in word-in-sentence identification, in conditions where participants do not have to read the entire sentence, and where brief stimulus presentation and postmasking makes complete sentence reading difficult. However, if lowercase presentation also facilitates more global sentence processing (i.e., beyond single word identification) one might expect to observe an interaction between letter case and the sentence superiority effect. We see two possible scenarios here. One possibility is that lowercase presentation, by facilitating global sentence processing, leads to a larger sentence superiority effect. However, it is also possible that top-down support from sentence-level representations when processing correct sentences could reduce the sentence superiority effect by facilitating individual word identification. Anticipating the results, in Experiment 1 we failed to observe an interaction between letter case and sentence superiority. This provided the motivation for Experiments 2\u20134 where we investigated the impact of letter case on a more direct measure of global sentence reading by using the grammatical decision task (Mirault et al., 2018; Mirault & Grainger, 2020). In this task, participants are instructed to decide as rapidly and as accurately as possible if a sequence of words is grammatically correct or not and can be considered to be the sentence-level equivalent of the lexical-decision task. If letter case impacts reading beyond the level of single words, we expected to see proportionally larger effects of this manipulation in grammatical decisions to sequences of words compared with lexical decisions to isolated words (Perea & Rosa, 2002).2"

The average word frequency in Zipf values was 4.80 (SD = .63; New et al., 2004). All sequences were grammatically correct. From these base sentences, we created an ungrammatical sequence by scrambling the order of the words in the corresponding base sentence (see Table 1). The scrambling involved a change in position for all words in the base sentence except for the designated target word (located at either the second, third, or fourth position in the sentence). Thus, the same target word was tested at the same position in both a correct sentence and the corresponding ungrammatical sequence. The set of grammatically correct sentences and ungrammatical sequences were tested in both lowercase and uppercase (see Table 1) leading to a 2 (grammaticality) 3 2 (case) factorial design. A Latin square design was used such that each of the four types of sequence derived from the same base sentence was tested with different participants, but each participant was tested in all four conditions across different base sentences. Thus, four counterbalanced lists were created, and participants were randomly assigned to one of the lists. There were 50 trials per condition per participant, and therefore a total of 200 trials per participant. Target location was randomly at position 2, 3, or 4 on each trial, and different words were tested at the different positions."

There wasa significant effect of Letter Case (b = .44, SE = .05, z = 9.61), with fewer errors in the lowercase condition compared with the uppercase condition. We also replicated the sentence superiority effect, with greater accuracy in correct sentences compared with ungrammatical sequences (b = -.93, SE = .12, z = 7.44). The interaction was not significant (b = .15, SE = .09, z = 1.63).\nGiven the absence of a significant interaction between letter case and grammaticality, the results of Experiment 1 suggest that letter case is having most of its impact at the level of individual word identification rather than sentence-level processing. In line with this conclusion is the fact that the effects of letter case were even numerically greater in the ungrammatical sequences compared with the grammatical sequences (expressed as a percentage of average performance in the grammatical and ungrammatical conditions, the case effect was 4.43% for grammatical sequences and more than twice that, 9.63%, for ungrammatical sequences). This suggests that top-down sentencelevel constraints were facilitating target word identification, hence reducing the lowercase advantage on single word identification.\nHowever, the task used in Experiment 1 did focus on processing at the individual word level, given that participants only had to identify a single word in each sequence. Therefore, to test for effects of letter case on processing at the sentence level, Experiment 2 uses the grammatical decision task with the same materials.\nExperiment 2"

Deciding that transposed-word sequences were ungrammatical was more difficult compared with the corresponding control sequences.\nExperiment 3"

Nevertheless, this lowercase advantage, seen now in three grammatical decision experiments, is relatively small compared with the advantage seen in gaze durations on target words during sentence reading (Perea et al., 2017). Instead, the size of the lowercase advantage in grammatical decision RTs aligns more with the effects seen on first fixation and single fixation measures in Perea et al. (2017), and the effects seen in single word lexical decision RTs (Perea & Rosa, 2002; Vergara-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2020)."

            "heading": "General Discussion",
            "text": "The present series of four experiments examined the nature of the effects of letter case (lowercase vs. uppercase) when processing sequences of words. Experiment 1 used an RSVP technique with the postcued identification of one of the five words in the sentence with an aim to test whether the sentence superiority effect (i.e., more accurate decisions to grammatical vs. ungrammatical sentences) would be modulated by letter case. Results showed a substantial sentence superiority effect accompanied by a smaller effect of letter case, with higher accuracy for words presented in lowercase, and no interaction. The fact that grammaticality did not have a significant impact on performance in Experiment 1 suggests that the effects of letter case were operating at the level of individual word identification and not at the sentence-level. Furthermore, the fact that correct sentences generated a numerically smaller effect of letter case (expressed as a percentage of average performance, the lowercase advantage was 4.43% for the grammatical sequences and\n9.63% for the ungrammatical sequences) could be taken as evidence that top-down constraints from sentence-level representations were reducing the bottom-up impact of letter case on individual word identification. A more global impact of letter case on sentence-level processing actually predicted the opposite pattern, with stronger effects of letter case in the grammatical sequences.\nExperiments 2\u20134 provided a stronger focus on sentence-level processing by using the grammatical decision task. This also allowed us to obtain measures of case effects in RTs that are more directly comparable to prior observations of effects in fixation durations in sentence reading and in single word lexical decision latencies. In Experiment 2, we used the same set of items as in Experiment 1 and we found a small but reliable advantage for lowercase compared with uppercase presentation together with substantially faster responses to grammatically correct sentences. Experiment 3 was designed to test whether an increased difficulty in making grammatical decisions, by using transposed-word ungrammatical sequences, would produce a larger lowercase case advantage. Results replicated the findings of Experiment 2 but failed to show a notable increase in the size of the lowercase advantage. Expressed as a percentage of the average RT for grammatical and ungrammatical sequences, the lowercase advantage was 3.07% in Experiment 2 and 3.68% in Experiment 3 for grammatical trials and 3.34% in Experiment 2 and 2.68% in Experiment 3 for ungrammatical trials.\nTo examine whether the lowercase advantage in Experiment 3 could have been attributable to the difficulty in processing the uppercase sentences intermixed in the same blocks as the lowercase sentences, in Experiment 4 the lowercase and uppercase sequences were presented in different, counterbalanced blocks. Results essentially mimicked those of Experiment 3, thus ruling out an explanation of the case effect seen in Experiment 3 as being driven by list composition. In sum, all these experiments revealed a significant lowercase advantage in different tasks (word-in-sentence identification, grammatical decision). Importantly, this effect was independent of the nature of the ungrammatical sequences (easy vs. difficult), the nature of the composition of the list (mixed list of lowercase and uppercase sentences vs. blocked lists), and the order of the blocks (uppercase before lowercase or vice versa).\nWe therefore have clear evidence from four experiments for a lowercase advantage when processing sequences of written words. Crucially, our findings provide important information with respect to the locus of the lowercase advantage found in prior research in single word lexical decisions (Perea & Rosa, 2002; Vergara-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2020) and with eye movement recordings during sentence reading (Perea et al., 2017). Prior results plus the present findings all point to individual word identification processes as the primary locus of the lowercase advantage in reading, with little or no role played by sentence-level processing. One particularly relevant prior study is that of Vergara-Mart\u00ednez et al. (2020). In that study, letter case was manipulated in a lexical decision experiment with EEG recordings. The results revealed a significant impact of letter case for both words and nonwords in the N/P150 and N250 ERP components. This pattern suggests that letter case was affecting the early mapping of visual features onto abstract letter identities and the subsequent sublexical processing of orthographic information (see Grainger & Holcomb, 2009, for a discussion of the functional significance of the N/P150 and N250 components).\nFollowing Vergara-Mart\u00ednez et al. (2020), we therefore propose that\nthe lowercase advantage is mainly driven by early visuo-orthographic\nLowercase 3.36 0.65 2.97 0.57 Uppercase 3.75 0.73 3.99 0.59 Case effect 0.39 1.02\nUngrammatical\nLowercase 12.53 0.67 11.84 0.67 Uppercase 11.14 0.92 11.97 0.65 Case effect -1.39 0.13\nprocessing of fixated words during reading. This early processing essentially involves the mapping of visual features onto the abstract letter identities that, combined with letter-position information, form the core of sublexical orthographic processing. It is this processing that would be facilitated by the vastly greater exposure skilled readers have with lowercase text. The advantage remains relatively small, because in the Roman alphabet the majority of uppercase let-\nidentification processes as the locus of the effect. Combined with prior findings, we would argue that letter case mainly affects early visuo-orthographic processing, and that abstract letter identities rapidly dominate the processing of case-independent word identities which in turn dominate processing at the sentence-level, hence the rather small impact of letter case.\nters share features with lowercase letters (b-B, c-C, etc.), and therefore the expertise gained by exposure to lowercase text transfers, to\na certain extent, to the processing of uppercase text. Our results also suggest that the rather small lowercase advantage that arises during single word processing does not accumulate across multiple words in a sentence.3 This could be attributable to the fact that sentencelevel processing is mostly affected by the later stages of individual word processing that would be relatively insensitive to letter case (see Vergara-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2020, for ERP evidence supporting this view). Evidence in support of this has also been found in masked priming studies demonstrating that masked repetition priming effects for word stimuli do not depend on whether or not primes and targets are presented in the same case (e.g., table-TABLE vs. TABLE-TABLE; Jacobs et al., 1995; Perea et al., 2015).\nTaken together, these results suggest that some form of wordshape information (over and above word length information), that would only be available in lowercase format, is not having a significant impact on sentence-level processing. Moreover, the fact that we found effects in the range of those found in single word lexical decision studies suggests that our results are not driven by the parafoveal processing of word-shape information. That is, our results pose problems for the hypothesis that word-shape information would be mainly processed in the parafovea, where low-spatial frequency information would presumably have a greater impact on processing. Overall, our results fit best with models of reading in an alphabetic script that assign a key role for abstract letter identities in recognizing words (see McConkie & Zola, 1979; and Rayner et al., 1980; for early evidence using eye movements during reading), and a key role for word identification processes during sentence processing.\nNevertheless, some key questions remain open concerning the impact of letter case on reading. Under the hypothesis that the lowercase advantage is at least partly driven by a greater exposure to lowercase text, future studies could investigate the extent to which both word frequency (Perea & Rosa, 2002) and individual letter frequency (New & Grainger, 2011) modulate the lowercase advantage. The present study focused on the interplay between word identification and sentence reading. An interesting complementary line of research would be to focus on the interplay between letter identification and word recognition. New and Grainger (2011) found significant effects of letter frequency in an alphabetic decision task for both uppercase and lowercase isolated letters. Future research could therefore examine the extent to which the lowercase advantage for word recognition (Perea & Rosa, 2002; Vergara-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2020) is driven by frequency effects operating at the letter level."
