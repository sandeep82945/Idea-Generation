    "abstractText": "Recent advances in logic schemes and fabrication processes have renewed interest in using superconductor electronics for energy-efficient computing and quantum control processors. However, scalable superconducting memory still poses a challenge. To address this issue, we present an alternative to approaches that solely emphasize storage cell miniaturization by exploiting the minimal attenuation and dispersion properties of superconducting passive transmission lines to develop a delay-line memory system. This fully superconducting design operates at speeds between 20 GHz and 100 GHz, with \u00b124% and \u00b113% bias margins, respectively, and demonstrates data densities in the 10s of Mbit/cm2 with the MIT Lincoln Laboratory SC2 fabrication process. Additionally, the circulating nature of this design allows for minimal control circuitry, eliminates the need for data splitting and merging, and enables inexpensive implementations of sequential access and content-addressable memories. Further advances in fabrication processes suggest data densities of 100s of Mbit/cm2 and beyond.",

            "text": "Superconductor electronics (SCEs) feature almost zero static power dissipation, speed-of-light energy-efficient interconnects, and clock rates in the 100s of GHz1. In addition to these characteristics, SCEs can serve as facilitators for integrated classical-quantum computers due to their cryogenic nature2, 3. Despite advances in fabrication4, tools5, 6, and logic schemes7, 8, however, the lack of a reliable high-speed and high-density superconducting memory continues to impede the development of practical SCE systems9. In this paper, we introduce a scalable superconducting delay line memory that takes advantage of the technology\u2019s fast switching, zero resistance, and high-kinetic inductance properties.\nPrevious research has shown that directly applying single flux quantum (SFQ) principles to memory results in designs with low access latency but insufficient density10. While arrays of vortex transition (VT) cells have demonstrated the ability to store up to 1 Mbit of data per square centimeter11, they face significant limitations for further advancement due to their reliance on superconducting transformers. On the other hand, hybrid architectures that combine SFQ and complementary metal\u2013oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies provide better scalability, albeit with long access latencies12. CMOS units may scale more effectively than their superconducting counterparts but are slower and usually reside outside of the 4.2 kelvin cryocooler due to their power and thermal footprints. In the search for a viable superconducting memory solution, a considerable effort has also been invested in superconducting memory cells built from novel superconducting-ferromagnetic stack-ups13\u201317. While promising in many aspects, such designs suffer from complex device structures and thus have their own practical limitations. Lastly, an approach that attempts to find a compromise between the hard-to-scale VT cells and the hard-to-fabricate superconducting-ferromagnetic hybrids is that of superconducting nanowire memory cells18, 19. Recent implementation results indicate a bit cell area of 26.5 \u00b5m220, which is the most compact experimentally-verified superconducting storage element to date. However, despite their advantages, superconducting nanowire memory cells are addressed by hTrons, which bring about relatively slow access times, considerably high power consumption, and high error rates for multi-cell arrays.\nIn this paper, we forgo traditional array structures and propose a novel superconducting delay-line memory based on Passive Transmission Lines (PTLs). PTLs are, in essence, superconducting wires that can transmit single flux quanta with zero resistance, making them ideal for signal routing in large-scale SFQ designs21. If used to form loops, however, they can also be thought of as storage mediums. Figure 1 illustrates one such loop, which transmits SFQ pulses introduced at its input and delivers them after a specific time to its output. The pulses are then picked up and fed back to the loop input, where they are circulated again. Reading from and writing to the memory is achieved in a time-serial manner. This enables the time-sharing of control circuitry, eliminates the need for data splitting and merging, and, in doing so, circumvents the obstacles presented by\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n08 01\n6v 3\n[ cs\n.E T\n] 1\n8 A\nug 2\n02 3\nprevious approaches. The idea of using delay lines in memory implementations has roots that go back several decades. One of the earliest examples was the acoustic delay line memory, invented by Eckert and Mauchly in 194722, and published by Auerbach, Eckert, et al. in 194923. In the mid-1950s, IBM produced the 650 calculator, which relied on a magnetic delay line memory known as drum memory24, 25. Approximately a decade later, Oregon State University designed NEBULA, a medium-speed serial digital computer that utilized a content-addressable memory (CAM) made from 35 glass delay lines26. IBM also experimented with a similar concept in the 1970s while constructing non-volatile bubble memory. Bubble memory stores data in small magnetized \u201cbubble\u201d areas, and read and write operations are performed by repositioning these bubbles27. More recently, racetrack memories have been developed, which promise to deliver high performance at a low cost. In this case, data is stored along a series of magnetic domain walls in non-superconducting magnetic nanowires. Reading and writing are accomplished by passing current through the nanowires, which forces domain walls to advance28, 29.\nWhen it comes to superconductor electronics, the concept of realizing memory through data circulation is nearly unexplored. Hattori et al.30 made an early attempt to utilize a YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4 (YBCO) coplanar delay line in the late 1990s for constructing high-speed cell buffer storage for asynchronous transfer mode switching systems. Another effort was made in 2016 by Ishida et al.31, who proposed an SFQ cache architecture that relies on circular shift registers built from synchronous destructive read-out (DRO) cells. Although these approaches provide evidence of the feasibility and speed of superconducting delay line memories, their underlying designs are limited in capacity or addressing capability. For example, in the study conducted by Hattori et al.30, a GaAs 2\u00d72 crossbar switch allowed for an interface to be established with the YBCO coplanar delay line. But this crossbar lacks support for addressing, non-destructive readouts, or speeds exceeding 10 GHz. In addition, the estimated signal travel speed in the YBCO line is approximately 0.4c, where c is the speed of light. This implies that the minimum spacing between two subsequent data signals in the YBCO line would be about 12 mm. Hence, both the controller design and the line material impose significant constraints on the memory density. Regarding the DRO-based cache architecture31, synchronous cells are used to form a circular shift register, which hampers energy and area efficiency. Furthermore, shifting is controlled by a sequence of clock pulses whose length is determined by the provided address and the register\u2019s current position, thereby resulting in additional overhead.\nThe proposed PTL-based memory design, in contrast, employs primarily passive components; is fully superconducting; encompasses all typical memory functionalities, such as addressing, data overwrite, and non-destructive readout; and achieves interface speeds of up to 100 GHz in simulation with satisfactory bias margins. The high controller (pulse injection) speed, coupled with the SFQ slow-down caused by high-kinetic inductance materials, boosts memory density by reducing the minimum spacing between subsequent pulses in PTLs. For example, the minimum spacing in NbN nanowires is about 570 times shorter than that of YBCO lines30. To validate these hypotheses and quantify the projected gains, we conduct detailed analog simulations and formulate models that establish the relationship between memory density and various factors such as the operating frequency of the interface circuitry, pulse travel speed in the PTL, and line dimensions. For the latter two, we investigate PTL designs with different topologies, material compositions, and fabrication processes."

            "text": "The block diagram of the proposed memory is shown in Figure 1. The design consists of a PTL-based delay line and a control logic block. The delay line serves as the circulating loop storage and delays any data that arrives at its input (loop_data_in). The delay introduced by the loop depends on the line\u2019s length and the pulse travel speed in the line. At the end of each round trip, the data at the output of the line (loop_data_out) enters the controller, which serves as a memory interface. The controller is responsible for deciding whether signals from the feedback path (loop_data_out) or the input (write_data) will be forwarded to the delay line (loop_data_in) for another round and whether it will be copied and forwarded to the readout port (read_data).\nFigure 2 illustrates the schematic of the controller. Temporally-encoded SFQ signals, generated by comparing the value of an address counter with a target address, are used for addressing. The Merger cell, denoted by the letter m, stitches together and forwards all signals that appear on its two input lines to its single output line. When no pulse arrives on the write_address signal line within the designated interval, a pulse appears on its complementary signal line, \u00acwrite_address. A pulse on the loop_data_out line then flows from the DRO2R (DRO with two outputs) on the left into the delay line input (loop_data_in) on the right, without waiting for other signals. Inversely, when a pulse arrives on the write_address line, a pulse on the loop_data_out line is ignored, the content of the DRO2R is cleared, and write_data is forwarded to the delay line input and readout circuitry. The use of differential signaling for write addressing enables the correction of potential data timing distortions incurred in the control circuitry and the storage loop. The readout circuitry on the right comprises a DRO2R cell. For readout to occur, a pulse is loaded through the read_address line. As with the first DRO2R, there are two cases: either a pulse arrives through the loop_data_in line and pushes the stored value to the Q0 output port (read_data), or a pulse on the complementary \u00acread_address line clears the cell, flushing the stored value.\n2/13\nSimulation results for this design are provided in Figure 3. In both cases, the controller operates at 100 GHz, and three full rotations, or trips, are shown. Each trip consists of four intervals, with three of them corresponding to the number of supported memory addresses and one serving as the header, denoted by h. More specifically, in Figure 3a, a pulse is provided on the write_data line during the header interval of the first rotation, trip 0. In the third interval of the same trip, a pulse arrives on each of the write_address and read_address lines, denoting a write to and read from address 1. Upon the arrival of the write_address pulse, a pulse appears on the loop_data_in line, which demonstrates a successful memory write operation. The subsequent appearance of a pulse on the read_data line after the arrival of the pulse on the read_address line indicates that write operations have higher priority than read. To illustrate the non-destructive nature of readout, in trip 1 of Figure 3a, a pulse is asserted on the read_address line again, but this time, it is not paired with a pulse on the write_address line. It is again followed by the appearance of a pulse on the read_data line, which evidences the desired behavior. To demonstrate data overwrite, the same pulse ordering as before is used to set up the memory in Figure 3b. However, in this case, a pulse is asserted on the write_address line during trip 1 without being accompanied by a second write_data pulse. As anticipated, no pulse appears on the loop_data_in line after this operation, indicating that the first pulse was successfully overwritten.\nNote that the presented memory system allows one to search and operate on all of the memory contents while waiting for the entire circulation time to pass, thereby eliminating the need to broadcast to or continuously poll individual cells. The design\u2019s rotating nature not only circumvents classic fan-in and fan-out limitations of superconductor electronics but also supports the addition of multiple write and read ports and the inexpensive implementation of content-addressable memories26."

            "text": "To evaluate the performance and feasibility of the proposed memory design, we first provide schematics and simulation results for the memory controller\u2019s main components; next, we analyze their latency; lastly, we perform a voltage bias margin analysis for the entire system, including all loading effects due to the control logic, PTL, and accompanying driver and receiver circuitry. The controller, shown in Figure 2, consists of a DRO cell, two DRO2R cells, and a Merger cell (m). Figures 4-6 provide schematics for each cell as well as corresponding simulation waveforms to demonstrate cell function.\nAs is the case for any system, the electrical and timing properties of these cells affect both the performance and functionality of the proposed memory. In particular, electrical issues, typically brought on by susceptibility to parametric variation, can lead to fatally under- or over-biased Josephson Junctions (JJs), which in turn can lead to circuit dysfunction, or delayed or early switching times. To avoid erroneous behavior and ensure correct system timing, the effects of under- and over-biasing are first examined at the cell level. Performing this bias analysis for cells in isolation, however, is not sufficient because it excludes the loading effects that are present in a system setting.\nTo account for loading, iterative measurements and component tuning are carried out in an in-situ approach to achieve the desired timing. Accordingly, each cell is fully loaded by the remaining components in the memory controller. The results of this process are shown in Figure 7. Nominal cell delays are indicated in red. DRO and DRO2R delays are measured as clock-to-Q delays, while the Merger delay is measured as the propagation delay from either of the inputs to the output. Delays in each cell increase as bias decreases, and decrease as bias increases. To make bias margins symmetric, a set of component parameters is chosen that centers the nominal delay of each cell between the upper and lower time bounds of the controller.\nUsing interval analysis and the above delays, the maximum operating frequency of the controller is estimated, and the cell tuning and bias margin measurements are repeated. Another round of bias margin measurements is conducted, wherein the bias of the entire design is varied instead of individual cells. Figure 8 illustrates our results for frequencies ranging from 20 GHz to 100 GHz. We notice that electrical issues\u2014caused by, for example, Josephson junctions that are subject to the above biasing concerns and that switch too frequently or not at all\u2014drive limitations in bias margin width at lower frequencies, while timing issues are the limiter at higher frequencies. This happens because timing constraints get tighter as the address timing interval is reduced. For example, at 100 GHz, the address timing interval is just 10 ps, which leaves little room for the same variations in propagation delay that we observed in Figure 7. Our SPICE simulations show bias margins ranging from \u00b124% (at 20 GHz) to \u00b113% (at 100 GHz), which surpass the widely-accepted \u00b110% threshold32."

            "text": "The physical storage density\u2014that is, bits per area\u2014of the proposed memory depends on 1) the PTL\u2019s linewidth and spacing requirements, set by the fabrication process; 2) the travel speed of SFQ pulses in the PTL, set by the material of choice and the line topology; 3) the relative timing between two adjacent SFQ pulses, set by the controller\u2019s operating frequency; and 4) the number of PTL memory routing layers. We estimate the density of the proposed PTL-based superconducting delay line memory by choosing various settings for each of these free variables and summarize our results in Table 1.\nA typical Nb stripline of 250 nm linewidth with a minimum spacing of 250 nm4 propagates SFQ pulses at a speed of 0.3c. This leads to data densities of up to 0.9 Mbit/cm2 at 100 GHz, if four metal routing layers are used. Reducing the Nb stripline linewidth and minimum spacing from 250 nm to 120 nm is a possible but more aggressive design choice33 and results in densities of up to 1.9 Mbit/cm2. By switching device material and topology to an MoN kinetic inductor microstrip with the\n3/13\nsame dimensions, available on just one layer within MIT Lincoln Laboratory\u2019s SFQ5ee34 and SC233 processes, the travel speed of pulses in the line falls by about 6\u00d7. This slowdown yields densities of up to 1.4 and 4.0 Mbit/cm2 for 250 nm and 120 nm linewidths, respectively, at 100 GHz. By default, the SFQ5ee and SC2 fabrication processes allow for one MoN high-kinetic inductance layer, four Nb signal-routing layers, and three ground planes, based on the typical allocation. An increase in the number of the MoN high-kinetic inductance layers from one to four transforms the line topology into that of a stripline and increases the data density to 3.2 Mbit/cm2 at 20 GHz and 19 Mbit/cm2 at 100 GHz for a 120 nm linewidth and 120 nm spacing.\nAt this point, it is evident that the use of materials with increasingly high kinetic inductance is conducive to higher densities. To this end, we explore the potential of NbTiN striplines that exhibit approximately an order of magnitude higher inductance than their MoN counterparts and propagate SFQ pulses at a speed of 0.011c35. Our results indicate that for a NbTiN stripline with 100 nm width, 120 nm spacing, four metal routing layers, and controller frequencies between 20 and 100 GHz, the estimated data densities range from 10.7 to 53.3 Mbit/cm2. A more forward-looking approach comes from the use of NbN kinetic inductor nanowires. In the case of an experimentally-tested NbN nanowire with 40 nm linewidth, the inductance scales to 2,050 pH/\u00b5m36. A roughly proportional drop in capacitance keeps the pulse travel speed the same, 0.011c, but the reduced linewidth pushes the maximum data density to 75.4 Mbit/cm2 at 100 GHz. A reduction in linewidth to 15 nm causes the inductance to increase to 5,467 pH/\u00b5m36 based on a factor of 82 pH/\u25a1, which drops the travel speed to 0.007c and increases data density to 140.3 Mbit/cm2 at 100 GHz. This is equivalent to a physical pulse spacing of 21 \u00b5m, about 600\u00d7 shorter than that in the YBCO line30. Moreover, assuming that CMOS layer stacking techniques\u2014such as those used to create 100-layer stacks in V-NANDs\u2014could be applied to superconductor technology, this NbN nanowire technology could provide a memory density of 3,507 Mbit/cm2 at 100 GHz operating speed."

            "text": "The microarchitectural features of our most prominent computer systems have historically co-evolved with the technology and devices that embody them. For instance, in the case of CMOS, the combination of cheap transistors and power-hungry interconnects37 has motivated the development of designs that trade off resource redundancy for reduced data movement. By contrast, data movement in superconductor electronics is relatively cheaper than switching due to the nearly lossless nature of superconducting interconnects. Therefore, the critical question\u2014which the presented research addresses\u2014is whether, in the case of superconductor electronics, we can capitalize on the unique properties of superconducting interconnects to improve hardware efficiency, simplicity, and density.\nPrevious attempts to develop cryogenic memory technology, which functions at temperatures of 4 kelvin or below, have predominantly centered on creating individual storage cells that can subsequently be arranged in a standard grid configuration38. While such configurations have been effective in CMOS, they cannot fully leverage the advantage that superconductor electronics provide in terms of low-cost signal transmission. Additionally, they often disregard the forthcoming obstacles that arise from the limitations of inductor scaling and fan-in/out11, as well as the significant power consumption and long access times12, high device complexity13\u201317, and increased bit-error rate18\u201320 that come with the suggested structures.\nThe presented approach departs from this tradition and exploits superconducting passive transmission lines for the construction of a delay-line memory system. From a device perspective, delay lines are easy to construct and offer high signal fidelity. For instance, experimental results indicate that SFQ pulses can travel over 7 mm-long PTLs without re-amplification39. Moreover, the footprint and kinetic inductance of PTLs can be substantially modified by their topology, material composition, and fabrication process. By harnessing these characteristics in conjunction with our high-speed SFQ control logic circuitry, we anticipate achieving data density improvements of two orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art. This can be accomplished while retaining the same number of metal (memory) layers as existing fabrication processes. The method of vertical growth\u2014common in technologies like CMOS V-NANDs\u2014is also anticipated to increase data density gains by an additional order of magnitude.\nLooking forward, although there are no fundamental limitations to the development of scalable superconducting delay-line memories, a direction that invites further exploration is that of impedance-matching transformers, such as tapers40. Alternatively, in order to address any potential impedance-mismatch challenges, exploring methods to boost the transmission line capacitance and utilizing higher-permittivity dielectrics, like NbOx41, between the signal and ground planes could prove to be a promising approach. Lastly, there are several interesting questions pertaining to the microarchitecture-compiler relationship. Specifically, optimizations in hierarchical design, instruction scheduling, and data placement can significantly reduce the memory readout time and improve its efficiency in cases involving both sequential access and content-based addressing42.\n4/13"

            "text": "Simulation setup: The simulations were conducted using WRSPICE43, a version of SPICE designed for superconductor electronic designs. The resistively and capacitively-shunted JJ model employed in the simulations is based on MIT Lincoln Laboratory\u2019s SFQ5ee 100 \u00b5A/\u00b5m2 fabrication process34 with an ICRn of 1.65 mV. To generate SFQ input pulses from an input DC current stimulation, DC-to-SFQ converters were utilized. The subsequent analysis does not consider parasitic inductances associated with shunt resistors, as their impact on circuit performance has been determined to be negligible44.\nCircuit design: For the design of the memory controller\u2019s key components, as illustrated in Figures 4-6, we began with publicly accessible schematics45, 46. To achieve a higher operational frequency and wider bias margins, the number of JJs on the critical path of the corresponding circuit was minimized. To accomplish this, we designed a DRO cell with 4 JJs that matched the critical currents of JJs in the neighboring cells, resulting in improved signal quality. Additionally, the original DRO2R design features output paths that are symmetrical. However, as depicted in Figure 2, only the Q0 output (data_out0) is connected to the delay line loop. To meet the timing demands of the loop, the internal path from data_in to data_out0 was shortened. The serial inductors in the Merger design were also reduced from their initial values to improve critical path latency. Finally, we eliminated active Splitter cells45, which are commonly used to provide fan-out for shared nodes but incur an overhead of 3 JJs each. Instead, a recently-proposed IC ranking technique that allows for passive fan-out was adopted47. The combined modifications resulted in a memory controller circuit that comprises 29 JJs and a logic path delay of \u223c10 ps, which is determined by the sum of the DRO2R cell\u2019s setup and propagation delays, averaged over its bias margins.\nAnalysis: To evaluate performance, the timing resolution was set to 0.5 ps, which was interpolated from the internal step size used by WRSPICE, and delays were measured as peak-to-peak values. Specifically, the DRO and DRO2R propagation delays were measured as the clock-to-Q delay, and the Merger propagation delay was measured as the delay from either input to the output. To determine the upper and lower time bounds of each cell, detailed bias margin analyses were conducted. For bias margin measurements, we started at the nominal voltage and decremented by steps of 1% of the nominal voltage over the bias range where the circuit operates, to locate the lower limit. We then incremented the nominal voltage to locate the upper limit. Static timing analysis using minimum and maximum intervals was performed to ensure that the timing at the limits of the bias margins meets the hold, setup, and propagation time requirements at different target frequencies."

            "text": "The memory density of the PTL delay line was calculated using the equation:\nDensity = f\nw\u00d7 v (1)\nwhere f represents the operating frequency of the memory controller in Hz, w is the PTL pitch, and v is the travel speed of single flux quanta in m/s.\nController operational frequency and PTL pitch: The delay results shown in Figure 7 indicate a maximum controller operational frequency of 100 GHz. In the conducted memory density analysis, as summarized in Table 1, the value of f is selected to span from this value down to 20 GHz to highlight the trade-off between density versus bias margins, as suggested by the findings presented in Figure 8. Regarding the PTL pitch\u2014the sum of the PTL linewidth and minimum spacing requirement\u2014this is typically determined by the fabrication process. For example, the well-established SFQ5ee34 process allows for the reliable fabrication of Nb and MoN microstrips and striplines with a 250 nm linewidth and 250 nm spacing, or a pitch of 500 nm. The more advanced SC233 process can reduce the pitch to 240 nm. Further miniaturization down to a pitch of 135 nm and smaller is possible using e-beam lithography36.\nTravel speed: The velocity factor equation was used to determine the travel speed (v) of single flux quanta in PTLs constructed with different materials. The equation is given by:\nv = 1\nc \u221a L\u00d7C (2)\nHere, c is the speed of light in m/s, L is the inductance per unit length in H/m, and C is the capacitance per unit length in F/m. The capacitance and inductance values used in the calculations were sourced from literature and are shown in Table 1. In cases where geometric inductance is significant, such as in Nb striplines, the inductance scales non-linearly and must be\n5/13\nevaluated at each linewidth individually. Based on available experimental measurements33, a 250 nm-wide Nb stripline has 0.5 pH/\u00b5m, while a 120 nm-wide line has 0.65 pH/\u00b5m. For high-kinetic inductors like MoN and NbTiN striplines and MoN microstrips, the kinetic inductance is directly proportional to the length of the inductor and inversely proportional to its width. This can be calculated by multiplying the known inductance per square values of 8 pH/\u25a1 for MoN striplines and microstrips48 and 49 pH/\u25a1 for NbTiN striplines35 by the unit length divided by the linewidth. Regarding their capacitances, we relied on recently-published fabrication results33. For instance, a stripline having a linewidth of 120 nm has a capacitance of 0.19 fF/\u00b5m, which is solely determined by the dielectric material and geometry. Similarly, a microstrip having a linewidth of 120 nm has a capacitance of 0.14 fF/\u00b5m. For the 40 nm NbN nanowires, experimental measurements yielded an inductance of 82 pH/\u25a1 or 2,050 pH/\u00b5m for this width, and a capacitance of 0.044 fF/\u00b5m36.Lastly, inductance and capacitance values for 15 nm NbN nanowires were obtained from simulation results36. Effects of coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) have been observed in NbN films with comparable cross-sectional dimensions49. Nevertheless, these effects do not present an issue here, as the kinetic inductance of the films, even with the most extreme linewidths considered, is still one order of magnitude lower than what has been used to observe CQPS. Consequently, the phase-slip amplitude in our case will be e\u22129 times lower than in systems in which CQPS has been shown to be a significant contributor to conductivity50 , and for this reason, we neglect it in our analysis. Layer stacking: An approach to further enhance memory density is by vertically stacking multiple layers of PTLs. In this case, the memory density increases linearly with the number of PTL layers, denoted by N in the equation that follows:\nDensity = f\nw\u00d7 v \u00d7N (3)\nIn this regard, a stackup of Nb striplines with nine planarized superconducting layers, stackable stud vias, self-shunted Nb/AlOx-Al/Nb Josephson junctions, and a single layer of MoN kinetic inductors has been successfully developed and currently serves as the de facto fabrication process4, 51. This stackup, MIT Lincoln Laboratory\u2019s state-of-the-art SFQ5ee process, allows for four memory layers based on the typical allocation of ground planes and signal planes. Several advancements to this process are under development, including the addition of self-shunted junctions52, which use higher critical current density and can reduce the chip area of digital hardware by 50%, and the introduction of two additional routing layers53. Looking forward, foundries have recently announced plans to scale up to sixteen routing layers and one layer for NbTiN kinetic inductors54; to the best of our knowledge, however, there is no fundamental limitation that constrains vertical growth45, 55\u201358."
