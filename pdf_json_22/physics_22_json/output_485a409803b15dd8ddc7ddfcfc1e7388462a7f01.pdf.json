The phase diagram features a multicritical point at which all three phases meet as well as a QSHI-SSC deconfined critical point. The QSHI and SSC orders correspond to mutually anti-commuting mass terms of the Dirac Hamiltonian. Based on this algebraic property, SO(5) symmetric field theories have been put forward to describe both types of critical points. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we directly study the operator that rotates between QSHI and SSC states. The results suggest that it commutes with the low-energy effective Hamiltonian at criticality but has a gap in the ordered phases. This implies an emergent SO(5) symmetry at both the multicritical and the deconfined critical points.\nIntroduction.\u2014Within the renormalization group theory of phase transitions [1], criticality is defined by scale invariance and operators are classified as either relevant, marginal, or irrelevant. The concept of an emergent symmetry refers to critical points that have a higher symmetry than the corresponding ultraviolet (UV) model as a result of the irrelevance of operators that break said symmetry. For instance, in interacting one-dimensional (1D) systems described by 1+1D field theories, emergent Lorentz symmetry is the rule [2] and leads to the interchangeability of space and time. In 2+1D, O(N) nonlinear sigma models are robust only for N < 3 [3, 4] so that O(2) symmetry can emerge in a Z4 invariant model [5]. In other cases, emergent symmetries allow to rotate one ordered state into another. For example, the SO(5) theory of high-temperature superconductivity [6] conjectured the unification of the d-wave superconducting and antiferromagnetic orders. Away from a critical point with emergent symmetry, the operator describing the above rotation acquires a gap and is expected to manifest itself as a resonance with specific quantum numbers in spectroscopy measurements.\nDirac systems are a fruitful platform to investigate emergent symmetries [7]. Let us consider the 2+1D case of four two-component Dirac fields relevant for graphene [8]. In this setting, one can define quintuplets of mutually anti-commuting mass terms of either two Kekule\u0301 and three antiferromagnetic masses or two s-wave superconducting (SSC) and three quantum spin-Hall insulator (QSHI) masses, respectively [9]. Each quintuplet can be associated with a 5D superspin order parameter [10]. Theories in which Dirac fermions couple symmetrically to the superspin have SO(5) symmetry [11]. However, UV models of interacting Dirac fermions generically do not. A key question is, therefore, if the symmetry emerges at\ncritical points, of which we consider two classes. First, Gross-Neveu fermionic critical points [12] at which the superspin vector vanishes and which separate a Dirac semimetal (DSM) from an ordered phase (e.g., the DSMQSHI and DSM-SSC transitions in Fig. 1). For this case, results from an \u01eb-expansion [7] predict an emergent SO(5) symmetry. The second class are bosonic critical points, where amplitude fluctuations of the superspin can be neglected and the gapped fermions can be integrated out [13]. This case is described by an SO(5) symmetric nonlinear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten geometrical term, which has been suggested to describe deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) separating two phases with different order parameters [11, 14, 15].\nIn this Letter, we introduce and simulate a suitable lattice model. It has a global SU(2)\u00d7U(1) symmetry\n2 associated with spin rotation symmetry and charge conservation, respectively. The model permits auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations without a sign problem and supports DSM, QSHI, and SSC phases, see Fig. 1. Based on measurements of the dynamics of the operator that rotates between QSHI and SSC states, we argue that SO(5) symmetry indeed emerges both at a DSM-QSHI-SSC Gross-Neveu multicritical point and at QSHI-SSC DQCPs, at least at the intermediate energy scales accessible in our simulations. Model and Method.\u2014We consider the Hamiltonian\nH\u0302 = \u2212t \u2211\n\u3008i,j\u3009\n( c\u0302 \u2020 i c\u0302j +H.c. ) \u2212 \u03bb \u2211\n7\n( \u2211\n\u3008\u3008i,j\u3009\u3009\u22087\nJ\u0302i,j\n)2\n\u2212U \u2211\ni\n( n\u0302i\u2191 \u2212 1\n2\n)( n\u0302i\u2193 \u2212 1\n2\n) . (1)\nHere, c\u0302\u2020i\u03c3(c\u0302i\u03c3) creates (annihilates) a fermion with spin \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 at site i of a honeycomb lattice. The first term in Eq. (1) describes nearest-neighbor hopping of amplitude t. The second term defines an interaction on a hexagonal plaquette between next-nearest-neighbor pairs of sites \u3008\u3008i, j\u3009\u3009 (see inset of Fig. 1) with J\u0302i,j = i\u03bdij c\u0302\u2020i\u03c3c\u0302j +H.c., c\u0302 \u2020 i = (c\u0302 \u2020 i,\u2191, c\u0302 \u2020 i,\u2193), the Pauli vector \u03c3 = (\u03c3\nx, \u03c3y, \u03c3z), and phase factors \u03bdij = \u00b11 as in the Kane-Mele model [16, 17]. The last term is an attractive, onsite Hubbard interaction (U > 0) with n\u0302i\u03c3 \u2261 c\u0302\u2020i,\u03c3 c\u0302i,\u03c3, see Fig. 1. In addition to the global SU(2)\u00d7U(1) symmetry discussed above, H\u0302 is invariant under a particle-hole transformation so that our choice of chemical potential \u00b5 = 0 corresponds to half-filling (\u3008n\u0302i\u03c3\u3009 = 1/2). Hamiltonian (1) was simulated using the ALF (Algorithms for Lattice Fermions) implementation [18, 19] of the grand-canonical, finite-temperature, auxiliary-field QMC method [20, 21]. A sign problem is absent since, after a Hubbard-Stratonovitch transformation to decouple the perfect square interaction terms, time-reversal symmetry as well as U(1) charge conservation are present for each field configuration [22]. Results were obtained on lattices with L\u00d7 L unit cells (2L2 sites) and periodic boundary conditions. We use units where ~ = kB = t = 1 and set \u2206\u03c4 = 0.2 for the Trotter discretization.\nPhase diagram.\u2014To determine the phase boundaries, we computed the susceptibilities of operators of spinorbit coupling, O\u0302 QSHI\nr,\u03b4 = ic\u0302 \u2020 r\u03c3c\u0302r+\u03b4 + H.c., and on-site\ns-wave paring, O\u0302SSC r,\u03b4\u0303 = 12 c\u0302 \u2020 r+\u03b4\u0303,\u2191 c\u0302\u2020 r+\u03b4\u0303,\u2193 +H.c. Here, r specifies a unit cell containing A and B orbitals as well as a hexagon, r+\u03b4 runs over hexagon, and r+ \u03b4\u0303 over the two orbitals of the unit cell. The susceptibilities read\n\u03c7\u03b1\u03b4,\u03b4\u2032(q) = 1\nL2\n\u2211\nr,r\u2032\n\u222b \u03b2\n0\nd\u03c4eiq\u00b7(r\u2212r \u2032)\u3008O\u0302\u03b1r,\u03b4(\u03c4)O\u0302 \u03b1 r\u2032,\u03b4\u2032(0)\u3009\nwith \u03b2 = 1/T and \u03b1 = QSHI, SSC.

Correlation ratios for (a) SSC order and (b) QSHI order at U = 0.4 for different L and \u03b2 = L. Extrapolation of the crossing points of results for L and L + 3 in (c) yields a single critical point at \u03bbc \u2248 0.0174. (d) Single-particle gap at the Dirac point q = K near \u03bbc at U = 0.4. Here, T = 1/30, representative of the ground state for the parameters shown.\nthe matrices \u03c7\u03b1\u03b4,\u03b4\u2032(q), we extracted the renormalizationgroup invariant correlation ratios [23, 24]\nR\u03b1 = 1\u2212 \u03c7 \u03b1(q0 + \u03b4q)\n\u03c7\u03b1(q0) . (2)\nHere, \u03c7\u03b1(q) is the largest eigenvalue of \u03c7\u03b1\u03b4,\u03b4\u2032(q), q0 the ordering wave vector, and q0+\u03b4q the longest wave-length fluctuation of the ordered state for a given lattice size. Long-range order in channel \u03b1 implies a divergent corresponding susceptibility \u03c7\u03b1 \u2261 \u03c7\u03b1(q0 = 0). Accordingly, R\u03b1 \u2192 1 for L \u2192 \u221e, whereas R\u03b1 \u2192 0 in the disordered phase. At the critical point, R\u03b1 becomes scale-invariant for sufficiently large system size L, leading to a crossing of results for different L. We assumed a dynamical critical exponent z = 1 to set L = \u03b2 in the finite-size scaling, as justified by the emergent Lorentz invariance of the corresponding field theory [12, 14, 25].\nFigure 1 shows the resulting ground-state phase diagram in the \u03bb\u2013U plane. Previous work at U = 0 revealed consecutive DSM-QSHI and QSHI-SSC quantum phase transitions with increasing \u03bb [17, 26]. In particular, the DSM is stable up to a nonzero critical interaction due to its vanishing density of states [27]. The DSM-QSHI transition is an example of a Gross-Neveu critical point [12], whereas the QSHI-SSC transition can be understood in the framework of DQCPs [28]. We find that the additional Hubbard interaction favors SSC order, reducing the extent of the QSHI phase with increasing U . For U & 0.5, we observe a direct DSM-SSC transition with increasing \u03bb that is expected to be in the previously studied U(1) Gross-Neveu universality class [29, 30] (see the SM [31]). A key feature of the phase diagram of Hamiltonian (1) is the existence (within our accuracy) of a\n3 multicritical point at which the DSM, QSHI, and SSC phases meet.\nDetailed results for U = 0.4 are presented in Fig. 2. The data for RSSC in Fig. 2(a) are consistent with a transition to the SSC phase at \u03bbSSCc2 = 0.0174(6), the value obtained by extrapolating the crossing points to L \u2192 \u221e in Fig. 2(c). The analysis of RQSHI at U = 0.4 is more involved. Figure 2(b) suggests two phase transitions and an intermediate QSHI phase, as observed for smaller U . However, the extrapolation of the two sets of crossing points, shown in Fig. 2(c), reveals a single transition at the same value, \u03bbQSHIc1 = 0.0174(2) and \u03bbQSHIc2 = 0.0174(8), and hence a multicritical point at (\u03bbc, Uc) \u2248 (0.0174, 0.4). At this point, according to Fig. 2(d), the single-particle gap vanishes. The latter was extracted from the asymptotic behavior of the imaginarytime single-particle Green function [32]. Evidence for a continuous transition in terms of the free-energy derivative as well as results for other values of U can be found in [31].\nMulticritical point.\u2014We now turn to the nature of the multicritical point. A possible field-theory description is based on a 16-component spinor \u03a8\u0302\u2020\u03bd,\u00b5,\u03c4,\u03c3(k) with Bogoliubov (\u03bd), valley (\u00b5), orbital (\u03c4), and spin (\u03c3) indices. Specifically, \u03a8\u0302\u20201,\u00b5,\u03c4,\u03c3(k) = c\u0302 \u2020 \u03c4,\u00b5K+k,\u03c3 and \u03a8\u0302 \u2020 \u22121,\u00b5,\u03c4,\u03c3(k) = c\u0302\u03c4,\u00b5K\u2212k,\u03c3, with the Dirac points \u00b1K. In this basis, the Dirac Hamiltonian reads\nH\u03020 = \u2212 vF 2\n\u2211\nk\n\u03a8\u0302 \u2020 (k)(kx\u03c4 x\u00b5z \u2212 ky\u03bdz\u03c4y)\u03a8\u0302(k) , (3)\nwhere the Pauli matrix \u03c4\u03b1 acts on \u03c4 and likewise for the other indices. The ordered phases observed numerically correspond to five mutually anti-commuting mass terms M\u0302i. For instance, the three QSHI mass terms read M\u0302 QSHI = \u2211\nk \u03a8\u0302 \u2020 (\u03bdz\u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03bdz\u03c3z)\u00b5z\u03c4z\u03a8\u0302 and the two\nSSC masses are given by M\u0302 SSC = \u2211\nk \u03a8\u0302 \u2020 (\u03bdy , \u03bdx)\u03c3y\u00b5x\u03a8\u0302.\nThe Gross-Neveu Lagrangian expected to describe the multicritical point is\nL = L0 + g\u03d5(x) \u00b7M(x) + LB(\u03d5) , (4)\nwhere \u03d5(x) is a five-component field at a point x in 2+1D Euclidean space, L0 is the Lagrangian density of the free Dirac system and LB(\u03d5) that of the bosonic field. Both, L0 and g\u03d5(x) \u00b7 M(x) are invariant under SO(5) rotations generated by i2 [M\u0302i, M\u0302j ]. However, LB(\u03d5) is only invariant under the SO(3)\u00d7SO(2) rotation of the order parameter vector.\nBased on an \u01eb-expansion, it is argued in Ref. [7] that the terms that reduce the symmetry from SO(5) to SO(3)\u00d7SO(2) are irrelevant at the multicritical point. To obtain numerical evidence, we consider the generator of SO(5) that rotates between QSHI and SSC order, given by i2 [M\u0302 QSHI z , M\u0302 SSC 1 ]. A lattice realization of this\noperator takes the form \u03c0\u0302 = \u2211\nr \u03c0\u0302r with [31]\n\u03c0\u0302r = a\u0302 \u2020 r\u03c3 xa\u0302 \u2020 r+a1 + a\u0302 \u2020 r+a1\u03c3 xa\u0302 \u2020 r+a2 + a\u0302 \u2020 r+a2\u03c3 xa\u0302\u2020r (5)\n\u2212 b\u0302\u2020r\u03c3xb\u0302 \u2020 r+a1 \u2212 b\u0302 \u2020 r+a1\u03c3 xb\u0302 \u2020 r+a2 \u2212 b\u0302 \u2020 r+a2\u03c3 xb\u0302 \u2020 r +H.c.\nHere, a\u0302\u2020r = (a\u0302 \u2020 r,\u2191, a\u0302 \u2020 r,\u2193) and a\u0302 \u2020 r,\u03c3 creates an electron in orbital A of unit cell r; a similar definition holds for b\u0302 \u2020\nr. The operator \u03c0\u0302 transforms as the z-component of a vector under spin rotations. It is odd under inversion and time reversal [31] and breaks the U(1) charge symmetry. Our use of the same notation as in the SO(5) theory of high-temperature superconductivity [6] is motivated by an expected resonance in neutron scattering experiments at the antiferromagnetic wave vector (\u03c0, \u03c0) (being odd under inversion) inside the SSC phase with broken U(1) symmetry. In Fig. 3(a), we plot QMC results for C\u03c0(\u03c4) = \u3008\u03c0\u0302(\u03c4)\u03c0\u0302(0)\u3009 at (\u03bb, U) = (0.0174, 0.4), the estimated location of the multicritical point. The fact that C\u03c0(\u03c4) is independent of \u03c4 at large \u03c4 has important implications. The time \u03c41 beyond which C\n\u03c0(\u03c4) \u2248 const. defines an energy scale \u039b = 1\u03c41 as well as a projection onto a\nlow-energy Hilbert space, P\u0302 = \u2211\nEn\u2212E0<\u039b |n\u3009\u3008n| with\nH\u0302 |n\u3009 = En|n\u3009. In the latter, the \u03c4 -independence of C\u03c0(\u03c4) is equivalent to the statement that P\u0302 [H\u0302, \u03c0\u0302]P\u0302 = 0 [31]. Precisely the same holds for a conserved quantity such as the total charge at the UV scale. In this case, \u03c41 vanishes and the Hamiltonian commutes with the total particle number. From these arguments and the data in Fig. 3(a), we infer that \u03c0\u0302 commutes with the low-energy\n4 L=9 L=12 L=15 L=18 100 10-1\n10-2\n10-3\n(a) C\u03c0(\u03c4) (b) C\u03c0(\u03c4)\n0 5 10 15\nL=9 L=12 L=15 L=18\n\u03c40 5 10 15\u03c4\nFIG. 4. Time-displaced correlation function C\u03c0(\u03c4 ) at the DQCP for (a) U = 0 and (b) U = 0.2. Here, T = 1/30.\neffective Hamiltonian, H\u0302eff = P\u0302 H\u0302P\u0302 . This in turn implies an emergent SO(5) symmetry. Figure 3(a) also includes results obtained by neglecting vertex contributions. This bubble approximation to C\u03c0(\u03c4) exhibits a clear decay even at large \u03c4 , revealing that our findings are linked to interactions in the particleparticle channel. Because the \u03c0 mode carries charge and spin, it is expected to acquire an energy gap both in the QSHI and the spin-singlet SSC phases. This can be verified by considering the corresponding dynamical structure factor, C\u03c0(\u03c9) = Im\u03c7(\u03c9)/ ( 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b2\u03c9 ) with \u03c7(\u03c9) = i \u222b\u221e 0\ndt ei\u03c9t \u3008[\u03c0\u0302, \u03c0\u0302(\u2212t)]\u3009. We computed this quantity using stochastic analytical continuation [33], as implemented in the ALF [19] library. The results in Fig. 3(b) are for different distances g from the multicritical point along the path shown in Fig. 1. They confirm that the \u03c0 mode is gapless at criticality (g = 0) but has a gap that increases with g as we go deeper into the SSC phase.\nFurther evidence for an emergent SO(5) symmetry can be obtained from the temperature dependence of the QSHI and SSC susceptibilities. At the multicritical point, and given Lorentz invariance, they are expected to scale as \u03c7\u03b1 \u223c L(2\u2212\u03b7\u03b1)f(\u03b2/L), with anomalous dimensions \u03b7\u03b1 [34]. This is borne out by the QMC results in Fig. 3(c), which exhibit similar behavior at low temperatures and identical values of \u03b7 within error bars, namely \u03b7QSHI = 0.99(3) and \u03b7SSC = 1.01(1). DQCP.\u2014Contrary to the multicritical point, fermionic excitations are gapped at the DQCP. In the framework of Eq. (4), this implies that |\u03d5| remains finite and only its phase fluctuations need to be considered. Integrating out the fermions [10, 13] then yields a 2+1D non-linear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term that accounts for the phase dynamics of \u03d5/|\u03d5|. The relevance of terms in the field theory that break down the SO(5) symmetry to SO(3)\u00d7U(1) at the critical point can again be addressed using C\u03c0(\u03c4). The results in Fig. 4 were obtained at different values of U . As for the multicritical point, they suggest an emergent SO(5) symmetry.\nDiscussion.\u2014The key result our work is the phase diagram (Fig. 1) with a fermionic DSM-QSHI-SSC multicritical point as well as a (bosonic) QSHI-SSC DQCP. Up\nto the system size accessible in our simulations, we find that the operator \u03c0\u0302 that rotates between QSHI and SSC order is a constant of motion of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian at the critical points. This implies identical anomalous dimensions in the QSHI and SSC channels, as verified here at the multicritical point and previously at the DQCP [17]. The substantially different values at the DQCP (\u03b7\u03b1 \u2243 0.25 [17] vs. \u03b7\u03b1 \u2243 1) exclude the possibility that the results at the latter are due to proximity to the multicritical point. According to Noether\u2019s theorem, \u03c0\u0302 is the zeroth component of a conserved current. Being a conserved quantity, it cannot acquire an anomalous dimension. Such a criterion has been used to detect emergent SO(4) symmetry in Ref. [35].\nOur findings for the multicritical point give numerical confirmation of predictions of an emergent SO(5) symmetry based on one-loop RG calculations [7, 36]. Although we can provide roughly the same quality of results for the DQCP case, some care has to be taken in interpreting the results for the latter. Enhanced SO(4) [35, 37, 38] or SO(5) [39, 40] symmetries have been observed at critical points in various models. In the SO(4) case, the transition is argued to be of first order [37]. Emergent symmetries can occur at first-order transitions due to fine-tuning. For instance, the spin-flop transition in an SO(3) symmetric Heisenberg model has SO(3) symmetry at the UV scale at the transition point. For weakly first-order transitions [38, 41, 42], we can understand emergent symmetries within the RG framework. In this case, the RG flow becomes very slow [40] when approaching the transition. If the operators that break an emergent symmetry have a large scaling dimension, they will be suppressed at intermediate length scales. Therefore, first-order transitions can be naturally reconciled with emergent symmetries without invoking fine-tuning.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the Gauss Centre for Supercomputing e.V. for funding this project by providing computing time on the GCS Supercomputer SUPERMUC-NG at Leibniz Supercomputing Centre.

(15)\nHere, a\u0302\u2020r = (a\u0302 \u2020 r,\u2191, a\u0302 \u2020 r,\u2193) and b\u0302\n\u2020 r = (b\u0302 \u2020 r,\u2191, b\u0302 \u2020 r,\u2193). The op-\nerators a\u0302\u2020r,\u03c3, and b\u0302 \u2020 r,\u03c3 create fermions in the A and B orbitals of unit cell r, respectively; a1 = a(1, 0) and a2 = a ( 1/2, \u221a 3/2 ) are the basis vectors.\nWe now discuss the symmetry properties of \u03a0\u0302.\nTime reversal: Since the SSC and QSHI mass terms are even under time reversal, \u03a0\u0302 has to be odd. This becomes apparent from Eq. (15) since \u03c3x maps onto \u2212\u03c3x under time reversal.\nInversion: Inversion around the center of a hexagon leaves the SSC order parameter invariant. On the other hand, the QSHI order parameters are odd under this operation. Hence, \u03a0\u0302 is odd under inversion. Accordingly, in Eq. (15), interchanging a\u0302 and b\u0302 flips the sign of \u03c0\u0302r.\nSpin rotations: To understand spin rotations, we note that defining\nU(e, \u03b8) = e\u2212i\u03b8e\u00b7\u03c3/2 (16)\nwe have\nU \u2020(e, \u03b8)\u03c3\u03c3y [ U \u2020(e, \u03b8) ]T = U \u2020(e, \u03b8)\u03c3U(e, \u03b8)\u03c3y\n= R(e, \u03b8)\u03c3\u03c3y (17)\nwith R(e, \u03b8) an SO(3) rotation around axis e with angle \u03b8. Using Eq. (17), it can be verified that the SSC mass term is a spin singlet and hence invariant under the transformation: c\u0302\u03c4,\u00b5K+k,\u03c3 \u2192 \u2211 \u03c3\u2032 U(e, \u03b8)\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 c\u0302\u03c4,\u00b5K+k,\u03c3\u2032 . On the other hand, the QSHI mass terms transform as a vector, M\u0302 QSHI \u2192 R(e, \u03b8)M\u0302QSHI. Writing \u03c3x = ez \u00b7\u03c3i\u03c3y, it becomes apparent that \u03c0\u0302 transforms as the z-component of the QSHI masses.\n\u03c4 -INDEPENDENCE OF C\u03c0(\u03c4 ) AND EMERGENT SYMMETRY\nConsider the energy basis representation, H\u0302|n, \u03bbn\u3009 = En|n, \u03bbn\u3009. Here, we allow for degeneracies \u03bbn of the energy eigenstates. In this basis, time-displaced correlation functions of a hermitian operator read\n\u3008O\u0302(\u03c4)O\u0302\u3009 = \u2211 n,\u03bbn,m,\u03bbm e\u2212\u03b2Ene\u03c4 [En\u2212Em]|\u3008n, \u03bbn|O\u0302|m,\u03bbm\u3009|2\u2211\nn,\u03bbn e\u2212\u03b2En\n.\n(18) We will assume that for \u03c4 > \u03c41, with 0 < \u03c41 < \u03b2/2, the correlation function is constant up to exponentially\n8 small corrections and set E0 = 0. Then, 1/\u039b = min(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c41, \u03c41) defines an inverse energy scale. We can define a projection onto a low-energy Hilbert space,\nP\u0302 = \u2211\nn,\u03bbn,En<\u039b\n|n, \u03bbn\u3009\u3008n, \u03bbn| , (19)\nand a low-energy effective Hamiltonian,\nH\u0302eff = P\u0302 H\u0302P\u0302 . (20)\nFollowing our initial assumption,\n\u3008O\u0302(\u03c4)O\u0302\u3009eff = Tr [ P\u0302 e\u2212(\u03b2\u2212\u03c4)H\u0302O\u0302P\u0302 e\u2212\u03c4HO\u0302 ]\nTr [ P\u0302 e\u2212\u03b2H\u0302 ] (21)\ndoes not depend on \u03c4 . As a consequence of Eq. (18), and for energy eigenstates in the low-energy Hilbert space, O\u0302|m,\u03bbm\u3009 has to be included in the eigenspace HEm of the Em eigenvalue: {|m,\u03bbm\u3009, \u03bbm = 1 . . . , dimHEm}.

(22)\nWe can now perform a unitary transformation in each eigenspace to construct the basis \u02dc|m,\u03bbm\u3009 satisfying\nH\u0302eff \u02dc|m,\u03bbm\u3009 = Em \u02dc|m,\u03bbm\u3009 , O\u0302 \u02dc|m,\u03bbm\u3009 = Om,\u03bbm \u02dc|m,\u03bbm\u3009. (23)\nHence,\n[ H\u0302eff, O\u0302 ] = 0. (24)\nEquation (24) implies that \u3008O\u0302(\u03c4)O\u0302\u3009eff = \u3008O\u0302O\u0302\u3009eff is \u03c4 - independent. For our specific case, the operator O\u0302 = \u03c0\u0302 transforms as the z-component of a vector under spin rotations. Since H\u0302eff has the same symmetries as H\u0302 , and assuming that the ground state is a spin singlet, we have \u03c0\u0302|0\u3009 = 0 and lim\u03b2\u2192\u221e\u3008\u03c0\u0302 \u00b7 \u03c0\u0302\u3009 = ||\u03c0\u0302|0\u3009||2 = 0. In contrast, at finite temperatures, there is no symmetry argument for \u3008\u03c0\u0302 \u00b7 \u03c0\u0302\u3009 to vanish."
