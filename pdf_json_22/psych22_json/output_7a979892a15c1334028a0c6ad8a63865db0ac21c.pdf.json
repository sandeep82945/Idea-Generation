Quitline services o er telephone-based smoking cessation support to the public and have been shown to be e ective. There is limited research exploring the characteristics of smokers with a mental health condition who use the Quitline or the impacts of using the service on their smoking behaviors.\nMethods: This observational study aimed to compare demographic and smoking related characteristics, service use and quit attempts of callers to the New South Wales Quitline (2016\u20132018) with and without a mental health condition (N = 4,219).\nResults: At baseline, 40% of callers reported a current mental health condition. Desire to quit smoking was similar for both groups, however participants with a mental health condition had higher nicotine dependency and had made more quit attempts prior to engaging with the service. During program enrolment, quit attempts and 24hours smoke free periods were similar, however participants with a mental health condition engaged in a greater number of calls and over a longer period with Quitline compared to those without.\nDiscussion: The findings suggest Quitline e cacy for people with a mental health condition in making a quit attempt for at least 24h. Increasing the use of Quitline services and understanding service use for this critical group of smokers will increase the likelihood that their quit attempts are transformed into sustained periods of smoking abstinence. Future research should explore whether tailoring of Quitline service provision for people with mental health conditions may increase the likelihood of quit success.\nKEYWORDS\nsmoking, cessation, mental health, Quitline, chronic disease\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org\nLodge et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.868084"

            "text": "Tobacco smoking accounts for more than 8 million deaths globally every year, making it one of the leading causes of preventable death (1), largely due to chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and lung disease (2). The global prevalence of tobacco smoking has declined for the general population from 26.9 in 2000 to 20.2% in 2015 (3). However, for people with a mental health condition smoking prevalence has remained relatively unchanged with higher prevalence associated with more severe mental health conditions e.g., schizophrenia (64%) and bipolar disorder (44%) (4, 5). In Australia, people with a mental health condition live an estimated 12.0 years less for women and 15.9 years less for men compared to the general population (6). This is largely due to chronic diseases of which smoking is a major factor (6). Addressing this gap in life expectancy is recognized as a priority with national, state and local policies implementing strategies to support smoking cessation for this population (7).\nEvidence suggests that smokers with a mental health condition are equally likely to want to quit (8) and to attempt to do so (9). Certain characteristics that typify smokers with a mental health condition however (e.g., low socio-economic status, living in smoky environments and high nicotine dependency) (10), may nevertheless make it harder for those who access support for quitting to change their smoking behavior. As a result, it is important to understand how to maximize the effectiveness of cessation supports for this group to increase the likelihood of continued abstinence.\nThe World Health Organization recommends national tollfree telephone Quitlines as a population level strategy for countries to support smoking cessation (11). Quitline services have a broad reach and have been identified as a cost-effective means of delivering smoking cessation support (12, 13). In Australia, each state government is responsible for Quitline service delivery. Inbound calls to the service incur call costs, with outbound calls delivered at no cost to the participant. The New South Wales (NSW) Quitline service has been in operation since 2002 and is facilitated by the Cancer Institute NSW. The primary aim of the NSW Quitline is to provide smoking cessation support and information to smokers, exsmokers and the general population. Few studies have explored the characteristics of smokers with a mental health condition who use the Quitline or the benefit they may gain from doing so (14).\nTo address this gap in the research literature, the study aimed to compare participants with and without a mental health condition with respect to their:\n1) demographic and smoking-related characteristics upon\nenrolment with the NSW Quitline callback service; and\n2) service use and changes in smoking behavior (quit attempts\nand 24 h smoke free periods) during enrolment."

They can provide oneoff calls, or offer an outbound call service, offering up to six \u201ccallbacks\u201d, both pre-quit (preparing and setting a quit date), plus calls at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days (monitoring and supporting a quit attempt). Follow up calls are offered at 3, 6, and 12 months (ongoing cessation and relapse support). The number of calls people enrolled in the callback service may receive is determined by the individual. Counselors may discuss how the client can access additional support such as nicotine replacement therapy, or other support services. In 2017\u201318, the NSWQuitline actively recruited mental health professionals to enhance the services available to people with mental health conditions."

Of the 16,211 callers who contacted the NSW Quitline service during the study period, 4,219 participants met the inclusion criteria. For Aim two, the same criteria applied, however, callers who were still actively enrolled in the program were excluded from the analysis as they had not yet completed the program, and therefore were not appropriate for an examination of change in smoking behavior. During the 2-year study period, 2,253 of the 4,219 enrolled participants had finalized their enrolment (e.g., were no longer actively engaged as they had graduated, withdrawn, suspended or been referred on) in the callback program.\nData collection procedures and measures\nAt enrolment, participants were asked \u201cDo you currently have a mental health condition that you have been seeing a doctor about?\u201d (Yes/No).

Participants\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nLodge et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.868084\nwere also asked a series of questions relating to demographic and smoking-related related characteristics (see Table 1). At each follow-up call, participants were asked \u201cDid you try to quit?\u201d (No/Yes\u2013failed/Yes\u2013succeeded; defined as a period of 24 h without a cigarette). The number of contacts were documented on the participants\u2019 record."

Two smoking cessation variables were calculated based on participant responses to \u201cDid you try to quit?\u201d (No/Yes-failed/Yes-succeeded): (1) Any quit attempt (No vs. Yes\u2013failed, Yes-succeeded) and (2) 24 h smoke free period (Yes\u2013succeeded vs. Yes\u2013failed). Due to this question being asked at each follow-up call, a participant was classified as havingmade any quit attempt, or having a 24 h smoke free period, if they reported so at any point during the callback service.\nChi-square tests were conducted to compare demographic and smoking related characteristics, and a t-test to compare mean number of calls, between participants with and without a mental health condition. Logistic regression analyses were undertaken to examine whether self-reported mental health condition (yes/no) was associated with either making a quit attempt or sustaining a 24 h smoke free period during enrolment with the service, when adjusting for variables that may impact smoking outcomes (education, employment, heaviness of smoking index) (16). Due to the large sample size andmultiple tests being undertaken, the threshold for statistical significance was p < 0.01. Analyses included all available data."

Consistent with previous international research (17), participants with a mental health condition tended to smoke more cigarettes daily and were more likely to have a high nicotine dependence, factors which mitigate against the likelihood of quitting success.\nParticipants with a mental health condition had made a greater number of quit attempts prior to enrolment compared to participants without a mental health condition. The present research stands in contrast to the documented beliefs among some health clinicians that those with a mental health condition are not interested in quitting (18). It is important to address health clinicians\u2019 beliefs about this population (as they often make referrals to Quitline) to ensure they know there is a desire to quit and that, when offered support to do so, people with a mental health condition are likely to make at least short-term changes to smoking behavior.\nThe similar number of quit attempts and 24 h periods of abstinence during enrolment suggests that both participants with and without mental health conditions received adequate levels of support from the Quitline callback service to make at least short-term changes in their smoking behavior. However, participants with a mental health condition engaged in significantly more telephone calls with the service over a longer period when compared to participants without a mental health condition. This finding is consistent with previous research (19) and suggests that people with a mental health condition may require additional support when making a quit attempt due to additional barriers such as higher nicotine dependence and limited social support. This could have implications for Quitline services to work toward tailoring, through strategies such as routine provision of nicotine replacement treatment starter packs to help address cessation challenges such as more severe withdrawal, financial hardship and social isolation. Some studies have attempted to address these barriers through trialing different models of smoking cessation care that include monitoring the effects of nicotine withdrawal during a quit attempt (20) and utilizing peer workers to provide encouragement (21). Further research is required to examine the optimal level and type of support Quitline services might provide to people with mental health conditions to increase the likelihood of quit success and effectiveness in supporting long term cessation.\nLimitations of the study include the capacity to look at only short term changes in smoking behavior, such as a 24 h period of abstinence as opposed to a measure such as 7-day point prevalence; although, 24 h abstinence is a measure commonly used in tobacco research (22). A lack of participant data at follow-up meant it was not possible to report on long-term cessation attempts. Challenges of real-world data collection and using service data not primarily designed to address\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nLodge et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.868084\nresearch questions, contributed to such instances of missing data and difficulty in discerning the underlying reasons\u2014such as participant drop out from the program, lack of rigor in data collection or other factors. The individualized nature of Quitline service delivery and resultant variation in data collection points led to some inconsistency with respect to \u201cwhen\u201d data pertaining to changes in smoking behavior was collected. It should also be acknowledged that during the study period the Quitline service began to employ some staff with mental health qualifications. Exploring to what extent participants with a MHC received their calls from a mental health professional, and possible associations of having a mental health advisor with service use and cessation related outcomes, would be valuable to address in future research.\nSmokers with a mental health condition engaging with the NSW Quitline experienced high nicotine dependence, were more likely to be living in smoky environments and less likely to have partner support. Despite this, such smokers who commence with the Quitline service are equally likely to want to quit and report having made more previous attempts to do so than people without a mental health condition. Furthermore, people with a mental health condition are equally likely to make a quit attempt and cease smoking for at least 24 h whilst enrolled when compared to smokers without a mental health condition. Further research is required to understand long-term smoking outcomes of people with mental health conditions, and whether tailoring of Quitline service provision to consider the needs and characteristics of this group of smokers will increase the likelihood that quit attempts are translated into smoking cessation."
