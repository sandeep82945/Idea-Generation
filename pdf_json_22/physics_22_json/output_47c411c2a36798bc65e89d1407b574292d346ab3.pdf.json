    "abstractText": "To fill the allotted area without overlapping, a regular or asymmetric filling of an empty space must be created using the time-dependent packing technique known as random sequential adsorption (RSA). Reaching saturation is a difficult undertaking since the density of coverage tends to hit a limit in the infinite-time limit. In this study, we try to precisely determine the saturated packing of oriented 2-d polygons, such as squares (4-sided), regular convex polygons such as pentagons (5-sided), hexagons (6-sided), heptagons (7-sided), octagons (8-sided), nonagons (9sided), decagons (10-sided), dodecagons (12-sided), and polygon with 15 (Pentadecagon) and 20 sides (Icosagon) using a newly developed algorithm named here exclusion assisted packing. While using a different technique, our findings are in line with earlier extrapolation-based research as well as more recent attempts to establish strictly saturated packaging. We applied the \"separating axis theorem\" to determine if freshly inserted and previously placed polygons overlap. In these circumstances, we show that saturation as a lower limit is achieved when the RSA addition slows down too much. The next step was using a newly developed technique to saturate the available space. The results of polygons' calculated saturation packing were found to be comparable to results obtained from other methods and techniques presented in the references (Cie\u015bla et al., 2021; Zhang, 2018; Zhang & Torquato, 2013).",

Reaching saturation is a difficult undertaking since the density of coverage tends to hit a limit in the infinite-time limit. In this study, we try to precisely determine the saturated packing of oriented 2-d polygons, such as squares (4-sided), regular convex polygons such as pentagons (5-sided), hexagons (6-sided), heptagons (7-sided), octagons (8-sided), nonagons (9- sided), decagons (10-sided), dodecagons (12-sided), and polygon with 15 (Pentadecagon) and 20 sides (Icosagon) using a newly developed algorithm named here exclusion assisted packing. While using a different technique, our findings are in line with earlier extrapolation-based research as well as more recent attempts to establish strictly saturated packaging. We applied the \"separating axis theorem\" to determine if freshly inserted and previously placed polygons overlap. In these circumstances, we show that saturation as a lower limit is achieved when the RSA addition slows down too much. The next step was using a newly developed technique to saturate the available space. The results of polygons' calculated saturation packing were found to be comparable to results obtained from other methods and techniques presented in the references (Cie\u015bla et al., 2021; Zhang, 2018; Zhang & Torquato, 2013).\nKeywords: RSA, regular polygons, separating axis theorem, voxel elimination, RSA saturation"

            "text": "There are several uses for random packings, a popular model for random media, in theoretical and practical situations(Lee & Subbiah, 1991; Torquato & Jiao, 2009; Truskett et al., 1998). Random close packing (RCP), a sort of random packing, is one where the packing is created continuously until the density stops rising and the particles are in touch with one another. Although RCP is\nfrequently used to simulate granular materials(Jaeger & Nagel, 1992; Liu et al., 2018; Meng et al., 2016), its definition raises questions since it is challenging to maximize both packing density and disorder at the same time(Torquato et al., 2000). Additionally, the precise measurement techniques utilised, whether numerical or experimental, might have an impact on the density of the packing(Asencio et al., 2017).\nRSA is another type of packing generation technique that has a well-defined mean packing density(Evans, 1993). A virtual particle is chosen at random for location and orientation inside the packing, and if it does not intersect with any other particles, it is added to the packing with its position and orientation fixed. This process is used to generate the packing. The virtual particle is eliminated if it does connect with other particles. Up to the point where there is no more room big enough to add another particle, this procedure is repeated. RSA was first developed early in the 20th century(Flory, 1953), but it gained widespread attention due to Feder's observation that RSA packings resemble monolayers created during irreversible adsorption processes(Feder, 1980).\nThe creation of experimental adsorption layers on surfaces or interfaces has been modeled in a variety of industrial contexts using RSA. As in the case of Pickering emulsions in the oil industry(Moud, 2022), these layers are frequently produced by molecules or particles adhering to a surface and forming one. Modeling these layers and examining the interactions between adsorbed particles and the surface, as well as the impact of these interactions on molecule orientation inside the layer, may be done using RSA algorithms, which generate two-dimensional loose random packings. Researchers can assess how well RSA predicts adsorption kinetics and the shape of the adsorption layer by comparing experimentally determined features with those derived from RSA modeling (Hemmersam et al., 2008; Kosior et al., 2020; Manzi et al., 2019; Min et al., 2017).\nIn addition to its practical applications, RSA also serves as a simple yet effective protocol for forming disordered packings that consider excluded volume effects(Baule, 2019; Baule, 2017; Onsager & Runnels, 1963). This makes it a useful tool for studying the properties of a wide range of different shapes in colloidal systems. However, it should be noted that RSA is not suitable for studying other phenomena induced by excluded volume, such as phase transitions(Frenkel, 1987; Onsager, 1949), as the system it produces is essentially non-equilibrium(Torquato, 2018).\nNumerous investigations on RSA have included packings made up of mono-disperse items of different forms. Classical geometries like discs (Zhang & Torquato, 2013), squares(Brosilow et\nal., 1991), polygons (Zhang, 2018), and ellipses(Haiduk et al., 2018) have been used in these forms as well as more unusual ones such smoothed dimers(Cie\u015bla et al., 2016), disco rectangles(Lebovka et al., 2011), star polygons(Cie\u015bla & Barbasz, 2014), and polygons with rounded corners(Cie\u015bla et al., 2021). In the one-dimensional case, the saturation packing fraction can be obtained analytically as 0.747597920 (R\u00e9nyi, 1958) however for two-dimensional and 3-D the saturation packing fraction for discs and spheres has been estimated only through numerical simulations; the most precise ones are 0.5470735 \u00b1 0.0000028 for two dimensional and 0.3841307 \u00b1 0.000002 for 3-D cases(Zhang & Torquato, 2013). Other figures reported for two dimensional simulations of discs are 0.5470735(Zhang & Torquato, 2013), 0.547067(Cie\u015bla & Ziff, 2018), 0.547070(Cie\u015bla & Nowak, 2016), 0.5470690(Wang, 1994), 0.54700(Torquato et al., 2006), 0.54711(Chen & Holmes-Cerfon, 2017), 0.5472(Hinrichsen et al., 1990), 0.547(Feder & Giaever, 1980), 0.5479(Wang, 2000). The most accurate report for discs is 0.547068869 \u00b1 0.000000057 and can be found in ref (Kubala et al., 2022). Similarly for 2-D aligned squares saturation coverage reported in the literature is 0.562009(Brosilow et al., 1991), 0.5623(Wang, 2000), 0.562(Feder & Giaever, 1980), 0.5565(Blaisdell & Solomon, 1970), 0.5625(Dickman et al., 1991), 0.5444(Tory et al., 1983), 0.5629(Akeda & Hori, 1976), 0.562(Jodrey & Tory, 1980).\nOne of the main challenges with RSA modeling is how the algorithm performs when it approaches saturation. In adsorption experiments, saturated monolayers may frequently be created in a couple of minutes; however, the conventional RSA strategy becomes unsuccessful when there is little chance of finding a large enough region for a second particle. This results in a large increase in the expected number of RSA iterations needed to find such a space, which lengthens simulation times. Additionally, because the algorithm is unable to determine when the packing is saturated, it may continue to try to add additional particles even after saturation is reached, even when doing so is no longer feasible.\nMethods have been developed to address the problems with the efficiency of the RSA algorithm near saturation, but these methods have only been successful and reported only for specific shapes such as discs(Ebeida et al., 2012; Wang, 1994; Zhang & Torquato, 2013), ellipses, spherocylinders, and polygons(Kasperek et al., 2018) (Cie\u015bla et al., 2019; Zhang, 2018).\nThis paper presents a method for generating RSA packings using polygons with fixed orientation and tests its effectiveness. The study begins with squares and ends with polygons with side counts\nof 12,15 and 20 and employs the RSA approach to calculate the saturation packing limit for convex polygons with up to 20 sides. The results showed that the samples gradually produced structures with increasing packing as the number of sides in the polygons increased, and values close to those observed for discs were regenerated. The \"separating axis theorem\" technique was used to determine if there was a collision between two polygons in this study, and the details of the algorithm are described in the following sections.\nIn the study of adsorption layers, basic geometric forms like discs, two-dimensional spherocylinders, or ellipses(Adamczyk, 2017; Matijevic & Borkovec, 2004) are frequently used to mimic the cross-section of complicated molecules. Numerous molecules, even ones with more complicated structures that may be modeled using numerous discs(Adamczyk et al., 2010; Cie\u015bla et al., 2013), can be represented using these models. Nevertheless, the models made using this approach can have rough, concave cross-sections and unwanted steric effects. To analyze polygon adsorption in greater depth, it may thus be essential to assess more complicated cross sections, as will be presented here. Due to its simplicity and lower computing cost, the polygon in this instance has been chosen with a fixed orientation. In further experiments, we will use more stringent techniques, such as adding arbitraty orientation to polygons that may be able to more clearly capture molecular adoptions.\nThis work presents a novel approach to generate RSA packings using arbitrary polygons with a fixed orientation, allowing the construction of models that more accurately simulate the adsorption of practically any two-dimensional shape and more accurately represent the convex cross-sections of many molecules. Researchers may more precisely analyze the adsorption processes by employing these polygons, especially when it comes to the anchoring of orientated particles that may be caused by flow-induced orientation. This study also aims to investigate how the form of an adsorbed particle affects the primary characteristics of their random packing as measured by mean saturation packing."

This procedure may result in a film made of molecules that have been randomly adsorbed due to adhesion. Here, our attention is on irreversible adsorption that results in adsorbate monolayers. Molecular\ndynamics (MD) is a simple method for numerically simulating these events. The benefits of MD include precise prediction and control over most environmental variables, including temperature and the diffusion constant(Binder, 1995). The main issue is the performance fault, and the reference (Berendsen, 1999) addresses the limitations of MD techniques in adsorption applications. Due to this, we chose to employ a different technique called continuum RSA, which has been used to explore colloidal systems with success(Adamczyk et al., 1997).\nTo perform simulation:\n\u2022 A virtual particle was produced (polygons with a varied number of sides), and based on a\nuniform probability distribution, its position in an area was picked at random.\n\u2022 An overlap test (subject of next section) with a virtual particle's adsorbed previous closest\nneighbors was conducted.

            "text": "The existence of an intersection between two polygons may be checked using a variety of procedures. The \"separating axis theorem\" is one such approach that uses mathematical equations to determine if two polygons are overlapping(Gottschalk et al., 1996). According to the separating axis theorem (SAT), two convex polygons do not cross if a line separates them. The normal to one of the edges of either polygon can be referred to as the separation axis, which is a line.\nThe following actions can be conducted to determine whether two polygons (here referred to as Polygon A and Polygon B) cross using the separating axis theorem:\n\u2022 Calculate the edge normal for each edge in polygon A, then project both polygons onto the\nedge normal.\n\u2022 Determine each polygon's minimum and maximum projection onto the normal.\n\u2022 The polygons do not overlap if the maximum projection of polygon A is smaller than the\nminimum projection of polygon B, or vice versa.\n\u2022 Repeat the process for each edge in polygon B if the projections overlap.\n\u2022 The polygons connect if their projections onto all separating axes do not overlap.\nWhile the SAT can be used to detect if two convex polygons overlap, it is possible that non-convex polygons or polygons with holes will not be covered by this theorem. Other methods could be required in certain circumstances to check for the intersection.\nFor this study, in addition to the classical RSA model which we showcase qualitatively here, we pursued the application of another method that generates strictly saturated RSA packings; algorithms with similar foundation with their details have been explained comprehensively in two recent publications(Zhang, 2018; Zhang & Torquato, 2013). We name this method \u201cexclusionassisted packing\u201d. To explain our algorithm, the initial active voxels are all the equally sized meshes that make up the collector area before the algorithm is launched. The next step is to randomly select a location inside the voxel and determine if placing a polygon there would cause it to collide with polygons already in place. If the response is \"yes,\" the voxel is classified as inactive; if \"no,\" a new particle is added to the pool of adsorbed particles. The details of the process are shown in Figure 1.\nThe initial mesh size chosen for the collector was 50 by 50 in a range of 1 million. This was eventually increased to a final mesh size of 0.015 units, which resulted in approximately 12 million voxels. The following conditions were used for the simulation:\n\u2022 Boundary condition: Fixed\n\u2022 For each polygon, the simulation was repeated 100 times and the average as mean\nsaturation packing was reported.\n\u2022 Both extrapolation and voxel elimination methods were used, and the results were\ncompared.\n\u2022 A total of 10 objects (squares, pentagons, hexagons, heptagons, octagons, decagons,\ndodecagons, 15-gons, and 20-gons) were assessed.\nThe eliminated voxels shown in the previous section reside primarily in the exclusion zone as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 has been used as an example to illustrate how the simulation process works; it shows how square and pentagonal shapes have had their locations segregated by square voxels. Due to the region's inaccessibility to other particles for the blue voxels in the block diagram, voxels with a red border are ineligible and deleted."

            "text": "To demonstrate the accuracy and usefulness of our algorithm, we build saturated RSA configurations of regular polygons and contrast saturation packing with prior findings documented in the literature; notably in the reference (Zhang, 2018); in which authors used a different algorithm and orientation were random. For each particle shape, we create 1000 permutations.\nIn (Zhang, 2018) the author describes a method for testing voxel availability in three-dimensional space for a particle simulation. The voxel space is represented by (x, y, \u03c9), where (x, y) is the location of the center of a polygon, and \u03c9 is the angle between the orientation of the polygon and some reference orientation. The voxel is defined as (x \u00b1 \u03b4x, y \u00b1 \u03b4y, \u03c9 \u00b1 \u03b4 \u03c9), where \u03b4x, \u03b4y, and \u03b4 \u03c9 are half of the side length of the voxel in each direction.\nTo test if a voxel is available, a rigorous worst-case error analysis is performed to prove that no matter how x, y, and \u03c9 vary in the ranges [x \u2212 \u03b4x, x + \u03b4x], [y \u2212 \u03b4y, y + \u03b4y], and [\u03c9 \u2212\u03b4 \u03c9, \u03c9 + \u03b4 \u03c9], the upcoming particle will always overlap with an existing one. This is achieved by calculating the error bounds for the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of the upcoming polygon inside the voxel. The method allows for the efficient testing of voxel availability in three-dimensional space and is suitable for use in particle simulations. The errors in the calculations could be small, which ensures accurate testing of voxel availability.\nNevertheless, while our technique (Zhang, 2018)'s for creating strictly saturated packings are comparable in terms of voxel removal, their respective bases for elimination are different.\nMost of the results discussed later in the paper were obtained using the largest area (50 by 50) with fixed boundaries; it is noteworthy that the side length of polygons was kept constant at 0.5 regardless. We checked that use of periodic boundary conditions does not have any significant influence on the presented conclusions. For instance, as will be revealed later, for the discs we arrived at a mean saturation packing value of 0.534803789\u00b10.002720619 for fixed boundary condition at a ratio of disc surface area to collector surface area of 0.01; keeping the same dimension for periodic boundary condition leads to arriving at mean saturation packing of 0.546637121\u00b10.000008419; thus, results here, while slightly different, can be compared later with studies conducting similar analysis using periodic boundary conditions.\nTo demonstrate visually how RSA works; the results of one of the simulations are depicted in Figure 4 in which squares are deposited in an area of 15 by 15 with the square with a side of 0.5\nand simulation is shown as saturation coverage gradually increases; in other words as simulation proceeds gradually more and more particles are deposited on the surface.\nTo look at the development in more detail, surface coverage was depicted as a function of simulation time to the power of \ud835\udc61\u22121/3 and results are shown in Figure 5a. Clearly at long simulation times of ~104, coverage very slowly reaches its asymptotic limit which is 0.5342139\u00b10.00008. This asymptotic limit is estimated analytically, however, the technique presented below may also be readily followed to generate a comparable figure. This surface coverage corresponds very well with the results reported in the literature for squares (Akeda & Hori, 1976; Blaisdell & Solomon, 1970; Brosilow et al., 1991; Dickman et al., 1991; Feder & Giaever, 1980; Jodrey & Tory, 1980; Tory et al., 1983; Wang, 2000).\nThe number of attempts needed to add a new particle to the grid can be known, and this information can be used to model the blocking of further adsorption through monitoring time. As more of the surface is covered, adding new particles should be more difficult, which can be represented by a lower probability (See Figure 5b). Adsorption kinetics in a real experiment typically depends on two variables: the effectiveness of the transport process (primarily diffusion or convection\ndepending on the experimental setup) that moves the adsorbate from the bulk to the surface, and the likelihood of catching particles that are nearby (Adamczyk et al., 1992; Adamczyk & Wero\u0144ski, 1996; Evans, 1993; Schaaf & Talbot, 1989; Talbot et al., 2000; Viot et al., 1992). Authors in other reports(Cie\u015bla, 2014) have concentrated on the second aspect in this case, which is defined by the blocking function, also known as the available surface function. The simulation makes it simple to obtain it as a ratio of successful attempts to all RSA attempts. Equivalent to the available surface function that is represented in the shape of time simulation is presented in Figure 5b. Figure 5b shows simulation time as a function of coverage; statistically, it is evident that more trials are required to attain adsorption because the surface is already rather packed.\nDetermining the mean saturation packing for squares and other polygons using the new algorithm and comparing it to the findings for hard discs were the major goals of this study. For an unlimited grid area and infinite adsorption period, that ratio should be given. Despite having to cope with finite simulation timeframes, one must control the inaccuracy caused by the finite grid size. The calculation of maximal coverage depends on the RSA kinetics model since it is uncertain if there will be any potential for adsorption beyond the simulation time, especially in the case of large grids. There were several works in the area, because of earlier studies in this field (Hinrichsen et al., 1986; Privman et al., 1991; Swendsen, 1981), it can be said that asymptotically:\n\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc61)~\ud835\udc61 \u2212\ud835\udc5d eq.3\nFor irreversible deposition of disks or oriented squares; in which \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 mean saturation packing and \ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc61) is packing density at time, t.\nOne sample of the Results of fitting Equation 3 was presented earlier in Figure 5a. It appears that the asymptotic observation of coverage for squares follows Equation 3 nicely; therefore, the symptomatic simulation adopted here follows the previous finding correctly. Although no definitive proof of Equation 3 has been given, analytical and numerical arguments have been presented that strongly support its validity(Viot & Tarjus, 1990). Note that for isotropic objects, p is equal to the number of dimensions, and Equation 3 reduces to the usual Feder's law(Feder & Giaever, 1980). This study compares the outcomes of extrapolation experiments utilizing findings from previously published data in the literature to mean saturation packings obtained here using our newly created technique."

A sample of saturation densities for different shapes is presented in Figure 6. With the specific orientation used in this paper, as seen in Figure 6, hexagons are projected to have a high packing density due to their sides being well-suited for filling up the space in two dimensions. On the other hand, Pentagons with the fixed orientation adopted here are predicted to yield worse packings. Many methods have been developed throughout time to assess saturation packing, including extrapolation-based estimate (Viot & Tarjus, 1990) and more modern estimation based on recently developed algorithms that address some of the drawbacks of extrapolation methods(Cie\u015bla et al., 2021; Zhang, 2018; Zhang & Torquato, 2013).\nExtrapolation-based techniques use the following equation to estimate saturation packing:\n\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc4f/\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc5d eq.4\nIn which, \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \u2261 \u03b8 (t \u2192 \u221e) and Equation 4 is an extension of Equation 3. In estimating saturation packing, one gives the data from longer simulation times more weight when attempting to estimate \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65. If given all values the same weight, the approach's potential drawback is that each data point is given the same weighting factor. The higher section of the asymptotic area is sort of underweighted because there are a lot more of these points there. So, authors generally explore a new approach that creates a bias preferring the longest periods. These developments are consistent with the reports in the reference (Viot & Tarjus, 1990). The second method is to use algorithms that generate saturated packing these methods assist RSA to find empty areas more easily thus shortening the time of saturation considerably. The result of this approach will be given in the next section.\nDirect applications of the simulation based on the shape discussed here are in chemistry and adsorption. For example, there are applications for water purification where a polymer globe must adhere to the particles, and \u201cPickering emulsion\u201d applications where the peculiarly shaped kaolinite particles(Abbasi Moud & Hatzikiriakos, 2022; Abbasi Moud et al., 2021a) approach the\ninterface and frequently form a monolayer adhesion (de Folter et al., 2014) on the surface. In chemistry also, for instance, the form of compounds with five atoms, groups of atoms, or ligands organized around a central atom, defining the vertices of a pentagon, is referred to as pentagonal planar molecular geometry in chemistry(Housecroft & Sharpe, 2004)."

Here an algorithm inspired by the algorithm introduced earlier in the reference\n(Zhang, 2018) has been developed to precisely measure saturation packing through the voxel elimination method. For start, different shapes were placed on a square collector using the RSA protocol, with the surface area of the collector being 10000 times larger than the surface area of a single monomer. For each shape, we generated up to 1000 independent random packings to calculate the mean packing fraction, thus our results reached a statistical error of less than 2.0x103. This allowed us to compare the effect of the polygon shape on the mean packing. To eliminate inactive voxels, we used the method described earlier; details of this methodology were explained in section 2. The parameter for triggering voxel division was determined based on the number of consecutive iterations without the addition of any particles. The optimal value of this parameter depends on the packing size, the shape of the deposited objects, and the maximum number of voxels, and is therefore difficult to estimate in advance.\nTo make the algorithm automatic a number is defined for consecutive iterations without adding particles that propel the algorithm to go through further voxel division. The optimal value of this parameter hinges on packing size, and the shape of the polygon deposited thus predicting this number prior is a challenging task and must be tweaked case by case. To give an example we found that for the objects studied here, the optimal value of this parameter can range from 102 to 106.\nIcosagon 0.514478961 0.009730145\nTable 1 presents the mean and standard deviation of the mean saturation packing for each type of polygon. The shapes of the polygons that are under consideration are listed in the \"Objects\" column. Squares, pentagons, hexagons, heptagons, octagons, nonagons, decagons, dodecagons, 15-gons, and 20-gons are among the forms included in the table. For squares, the mean \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 is the highest, it is generally evident that as the polygon's number of sides increases, the mean decreases initially and then increases; however, it remains less than the mean saturation packing values for discs. In the same collector area, we also tried our voxel elimination approach for discs with a radius of 0.5, and we attained a mean saturation packing of 0.534803789\u00b10.002720619.\nSaturation coverage for equilateral triangles as 0.52590(Zhang, 2018), squares 0.523-0.532(Vigil & Ziff, 1989), 0.530(Viot & Tarjus, 1990), 0.530(Viot et al., 1992) and 0.52760(Zhang, 2018), regular pentagons 0.54130(Zhang, 2018), regular hexagons 0.53913(Zhang, 2018), regular heptagons 0.54210(Zhang, 2018), regular octagons 0.54238(Zhang, 2018), regular enneagons 0.54405(Zhang, 2018), and regular decagons 0.54421(Zhang, 2018) were previously for the same set of forms, although this time they were randomly oriented, were reported. The values reported here are like the values reported in these references however particles are oriented in the same direction as nematic structures in liquid crystals. As outlined in the introduction section, similarly for two dimensional aligned squares saturation coverage reported in the literature is 0.562009(Brosilow et al., 1991), 0.5623(Wang, 2000), 0.562(Feder & Giaever, 1980), 0.5565(Blaisdell & Solomon, 1970), 0.5625(Dickman et al., 1991), 0.5444(Tory et al., 1983), 0.5629 (Akeda & Hori, 1976), 0.562(Jodrey & Tory, 1980). Our square values are well within the range of values that have been published elsewhere. The boundary condition used here is fixed versus periodic variation in collector size ratio about polygon side, which may account for the modest discrepancies in values discovered between those provided. This information is reflected in Table 2.\nTable 2. Demonstration of saturation coverage across literature; shapes are changeable from triangle to decagon with an arbitrary and fixed orientation.\nObjects Mean saturation packing \ud835\udf3d\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc99 [-]\nEquilateral triangle 0.52590(Zhang, 2018)\nSquare (unoriented)\n0.523-0.532(Vigil & Ziff, 1989), 0.530(Viot & Tarjus, 1990), 0.530(Viot et al., 1992) 0.52760(Zhang, 2018)\nSquare (oriented)\n0.562009 (Brosilow et al., 1991), 0.5623(Wang, 2000), 0.562(Feder & Giaever, 1980), 0.5565(Blaisdell & Solomon, 1970), 0.5625(Dickman et al., 1991), 0.5444(Tory et al., 1983), 0.5629 (Akeda & Hori, 1976), 0.562(Jodrey & Tory, 1980)\nRegular pentagon 0.54130 (Zhang, 2018) Regular heptagon 0.54210 (Zhang, 2018) Regular octagon 0.54238 (Zhang, 2018) Regular enneagon 0.54405 (Zhang, 2018) Regular decagon 0.54421 (Zhang, 2018)\nAs the shape of polygons progressively changes into discs as the number of sides rises, it is intuitive that the values provided in Table 1 will drift towards the mean saturation packing of discs as the number of sides increases. Indeed, as we get closer to 12 sides, the difference between the dodecagon's claimed saturation coverage and that of the discs virtually disappears. We also observe that saturation is slightly lower for polygons with an odd number of sides than for their counterparts (pentagon and heptagon compared to hexagon and octagon); we hypothesize that this is because particles find it more challenging to pack efficiently because of the odd number of sides.\nIn conclusion, the densities of packings constructed of regular polygons are lower than the density of discs' packing for regular polygons explored here. Even side counts make packings denser because they reduce the average excluded area obstructed by a single shape. Increasing the number of sides aids to achieve more packed packings because it lowers the average excluded area blocked by a single shape. This area is measured by the parameter B2 of the virial expansion(Baule & Makse, 2014; Ricci et al., 1992). Convex anisotropic figures, it has a simple form:\n\ud835\udc352 = 1 + \ud835\udc432\n4\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d eq.5\nWhere P is the perimeter and \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d the surface area of the regular polygon. A lower value of B2, where B2 = 2 for a disc, can lead to denser packing at the beginning of the packing generation. However, elongated shapes may also form denser packings when aligned in parallel, especially close to the saturation limit where neighbors restrict possible orientations of subsequent objects. This competition (Cie\u015bla et al., 2016; Haiduk et al., 2018; Vigil & Ziff, 1989) between the effects of B2 and alignment can result in the densest RSA packings being observed for slightly elongated figures with small B2 values and parallel alignments.\nIn three-dimensional packings, the highest packing fraction is often observed for moderately anisotropic ellipsoids(Donev et al., 2004; Man et al., 2005) or spherocylinders(Ferreiro-Co\u0301rdova & Van Duijneveldt, 2014; Zhao et al., 2012). For set of objects considered here, the number is 2.273277 for squares that dwindles with the addition of sides to 2.008336 for Icosagon; thus, B2 approaches the value of disk.\nThe results are not unexpected despite the reasons raised above since, if these polygons were stacked in a lattice form, one would find that squares should be the most tightly packed (due to a better chance of packing having no corners that could leave a portion of available space open). Additionally, since their neighboring polygons cannot occupy it, particles with odd numbers of sides will unquestionably have more space. The mean saturation packing for discs should be attained as the number of sides increases. Additionally, the form of a regular polygon might have an impact on its excluded volume. Because the hexagon is more rounded and has a bigger interior volume, it has a lower excluded volume than a normal pentagon of the same size."

            "text": "Details on the mean density of packed particles are contained in saturated random coverage. The density autocorrelation function may be researched to learn more about their composition. The radial distribution function (G(r)), also known as the pair correlation function, in a system of particles (such as atoms, molecules, colloids, etc.) explains how density changes in response to\ndistance from a reference particle. G(r) is the radial distribution function (Hansen & McDonald, 2013) obtained from following equation:\n\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc5f) = 1\n\ud835\udf0c \u2329\u2211 \ud835\udeff(\ud835\udc5f \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc56\u22600 \u232a eq.6\nThe monolayer's first crucial characteristic is particle autocorrelation. Figure 8 displays the average structures seen by various RSA packings to be precise we selected to compare the microstructure of packings at \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 for square versus pentagons and square versus Icosagon. To make the graph comparable radius for the x-axis has been divided by the value of circumscribing radius described earlier in Equation 1. The peak in G(r) is growing for squares at the normalized radius of 1.414 for squares that are right on the edge of the particles; heralding that particles are neighboring each other closely. In other words, the function reaches its maximum for the closest neighbor, r = 0.5, and then begins to degrade because of the volume of particles that is lacking. A similar trend is seen in the pentagon and Icosagon, but there are more oscillating peaks. Indeed, the graph corresponding to Icosagon contains additional peaks, for instance, at r=2.5, 2.75, and 4.2, while the pentagons exhibit an additional stronger peak at ~3.9.\nAs the radius gets bigger, these peaks get weaker. Due to the coverage's randomness, these oscillations super exponentially vanish(Torquato et al., 2006), and after normalization, the function stabilizes at a value of 1. In addition, when the number of sides of polygons, the first peak corresponding to the nearest neighbor grows progressively sharper. According to this behavior, particles closer in shape to disks (Icosagon) pack more efficiently than squares. Additionally, the sharpest peak for the set shown in Figure 8 is sharper for Icosagons as opposed to Pentagons and squares.\nTo summarize, the average structure seen by a generic particle of the system described by G(r) displayed in Figure 7, shows a full agreement with the predicted theoretical regimes found in the literature (Donev et al., 2005; Richard et al., 1999). In all cases, we observe a pronounced peak at a distance r~0.5, with the sphere diameter that corresponds to the distance of the nearest neighbors in contact. For r larger than the diameter, the probability to find neighbors decreases. In fluid-like systems, theoretically for \ud835\udf11 \u2272 0.55, (Aste & Di Matteo, 2008; Donev et al., 2005; Richard et al., 1999) the G(r) is known to oscillate with decreasing amplitude something seen here."

            "text": "It has been shown for RSA of disks that the measured value of saturated packing fraction for small packings oscillates concerning the system size, like the oscillations found in the tail of the autocorrelation function (Cie\u015bla & Ziff, 2018). Therefore, it was expected (as a packing side length used in the study is much larger than 10 (normalized radius in Figure 8)) that the finite-size effects should not affect obtained values of packing fraction. To prove that the dependence of packing fraction on packing size for squares was analyzed and shown in Figure 9. Here we also present the packing fraction range reported earlier in references(Blaisdell & Solomon, 1970; Brosilow et al., 1991; Feder & Giaever, 1980; Wang, 2000), which is slightly higher but very close to the one\nreported here. This can happen with approximately one-third probability due to the probabilistic interpretation of standard deviations.\npacking fraction. The two lines sketched corresponds to values reported for similar squares in references (Blaisdell & Solomon, 1970; Tory et al., 1983).\ndots were obtained from numerical simulations, while the lines denote quadratic fits. The fits for each shape are as follows: N(square) = 142.4-11.96 x + 2.244 x\u00b2; N(pentagon) = -73.33+7.36x + 1.017 x\u00b2; N (Icosagon) = 1.321-0.2814x + 0.06867 x\u00b2.\nThe same approach should be used on several systems of various, but finite sizes to ascertain the density of saturated packing on an arbitrarily large surface. Figure 9 shows a quadratic relationship between the approximate number of packed particles and the square surface side length after an unlimited simulation duration. This behavior is comparable to that of randomly oriented regular polygons reported in reference (Cie\u015bla & Barbasz, 2014).\nConclusions\nThis study investigated the maximal random coverage or saturation coverage for a range of polygons, including squares through decagons, and compared the results against previous literature. The method used was a similar algorithm as those described in references (Cie\u015bla et al., 2021; Zhang, 2018), which was modified and extended to find the RSA saturation densities of two-dimensional regular polygons with 4 to 20 sides, and verify their consistency with previous results reported in the literature. It is worth mentioning that these results apply to a wide range of particles including asphaltene, graphene, cellulose nanocrystals, and kaolinite among others(Abbasi Moud, 2022a; Abbasi Moud, 2022b; Abbasi Moud et al., 2021b). Although, it should be noted that due to the computationally challenging nature, it is not possible to say that all the configurations are global densities maxima, but it is believed that their densities are close to maximal.\nThe hope is that further research in this area would lead to the creation of new functional granular materials. The importance of this research is in the understanding of how tightly the particles that make up these materials are packed together can have an impact on their structure and physical characteristics. Examples of these materials include liquids, glasses, and granular substances, and the results suggest that by utilizing variously shaped particles, new materials with unique characteristics may be produced.\nConflict of interest statement: The author declares no conflict of interest.\nData availability statement: The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available but are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."
