INTRODUCTION\nTodays gospel in clinical psychiatry is that the field struggles with the absence of useful biomarkers, requires relying on an operationalized phenomenological level (1) and that interrater reliability for common psychiatric disorders should be strengthened by various measures of transdiagnostic symptoms (2, 3). Facing the inefficiency of the responses provided in recent decades (4), the focus has shifted to better definitions of phenotypes (5): how to refine clinical phenomenology in order to find biomarkers, improve reliability, or better qualitatively measure symptoms?\nOne answer to this thorny question is a refinement of the analysis of clinical judgment and reasoning, which relies on a large literature in psychiatry that is continuously developed for more than 50 years (6). While this issue is not specific to psychiatry, this domain could be chosen as a privileged clinical field to study it, inasmuch as a complex medical discipline possessing a set of deep reflections, salient questions and subtle counter-examples (7).\nOn one side, clinicians can be considered as a non-explicit black-box model. They make choices based on clinical decision-making processes that are not necessarily explicit. These choices are\nmade according to an \u201cembodied model,\u201d i.e., a clinical model used to support the clinical reasoning and clinical decision.\nIn parallel, the growing interest in computational sciences allows considering \u201cobjective\u201d automated methods, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more specifically Machine Learning (ML) (8, 9). However, computational decision-making processes are created and designed by an engineer, who makes choices about the conception of such models that are not devoid of any subjectivity (10). In this way, ML engineers are driven by their experiential and subjective way of thinking, i.e., \u201cembodied models\u201d\u2014like clinicians.\nIn this article, we hypothesize that the co-lighting of reciprocal reasoning and cross-teaching between IA and clinician reasoning could be fruitful (11, 12). This interdisciplinary dialog would not only shed light on clinical practice but also create a dynamic for the challenges of the psychiatry of the future, bringing together digital technology and clinical practice (13\u201315).\nThus, we do not propose to list the different computational methods designed to replace the judgment of the clinician. Rather, we aim to discuss in a systematic way how comparing clinical reasoning with data modelization could help to understand the formulation of the clinical judgment.\nThe aim of this paper is to provide a translational roadmap comparing clinical reasoning with computational reasoning, as proposed in Figure 1. Such a translational roadmap corresponds to a set of definitions and tools, necessarily not exhaustive, which allows feeding the understanding of clinical reasoning for the ML engineer and the understanding of ML for the clinician. Consequently, this article is intended for both psychiatrists interested in ML and ML engineers interested in clinical reasoning.\nFirst, based on the relevant literature on clinical ways of thinking (16\u201325) and ML (26\u201332), we have differentiated the process of clinical judgment into four main stages. Such a translational effort allows to analytically detail each step of the two modes of clinical and computational reasoning. Secondly, we have brought to light parallels between clinical reasoning, the engineer methodology to build a ML model and the ML model itself. Such identification necessarily leads us to distinguish the decision-making model of clinicians, embodied with them, the decision-making model of ML engineers (about how to design a ML model), embodied with them, and the ML models themselves. The details of these parallels are decomposed in four steps: 1) collection of variables, 2) theoretical background, 3) construction of the model, 4) use of the model. They are detailed in Table 1. A more complete version of this table with examples is available in Supplementary Table S1."

Indeed, the same treatment for acoustico-verbal hallucinations can be given, whether it is a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another type of delirium (e.g., paranoid).\nOn their side, to prioritize the variables, ML engineers choose an algorithm that corresponds to the criterion they want to satisfy, e.g., according to their discriminative power (38)."

For example, the medical model corresponds to a vision primarily guided by the consideration of common causes allowing explaining a set of symptoms, sometimes anchored in a mainly neurobiological model. These different theoretical traditions influence the definition of what\na psychiatric disorder is [e.g., harm and dysfunction in the Wakefield model (47), which postulates that a medical disorder is defined by a dysfunction resulting in harm to the patient], and by extension the consideration of the patient. Thus, psychiatrists are regulated by theoretical sets of laws and rules structuring their way of conceiving their embodied clinical model (and therefore of structuring their data).\nThis consideration echoes the different trends existing in the machine learning field which is at the crossroad of multiple different approaches. One example is the recent advent of datadriven AI led by Andrew Ng, in opposition to the classical model-driven approach that is usually employed in ML (48). In the latter, the focus is on the design of the machine learning model (e.g., a classifier or regressor) that will model the best relationship between the features extracted from this data and the label on a given dataset, whereas data-driven AI focuses on data engineering processes to obtain higher performances with a given model.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 926286"

Usually, machine\nlearning engineers follow implicit guidelines picked from \u201crules of good practice\u201d and some reference conferences, articles or ML engineers that make \u201cjurisprudence\u201d and serve as guides for machine learning engineers to design their models [e.g., the yearly conference NEURIPS (50), exposing the latest trends in artificial intelligence]."

Likewise, uncertain decisions will lead to different diagnostic, therapeutic responses and more generally different decision-making paths depending on the clinicians and patients willingness to take risks.\nRegarding ML engineers, personality also influences their choices. Indeed, depending on their recklessness (or adventurousness) or conservatism, their sense of the aesthetics, and other aspects of their personality, engineers will choose one implementation over another (51, 52). For example, enterprising engineers try new and funky pipelines despite the risk of low performances, while \u201cconservative\u201d engineers stick to state-of-the-art-inspired pipelines (53)."

The constitution of the theoretical background is largely influenced by two factors: time and expertise.\nConcerning time, the number of cases encountered by the clinician changes their initial theoretical background. For example, young clinicians tend to follow their personal readings and training will open up to other theoretical backgrounds over time (55). Regarding expertise, the knowledge of clinicians in one area influences their practices in other areas (i.e., diagnostic and therapeutic practice). For example, clinicians working with neuroscientists in a specialized center for autism might tend to apply their neurodevelopmental models to other psychiatric disorders (16).\nThe same tenet about time and expertise factors apply to ML engineers. On one hand, the more they confront diversified\nproblems and interact with their peers, the more their perspective of the field grows and allows them to embrace new theoretical backgrounds (10). On the other hand, engineers working in a neurocomputational or in a theoretical informatics team do not embrace similar problems in the same way, and develop different approaches to solve them.\nRegarding the ML model, when the pipeline is put into production (real-life situation), no background modification is possible (the pipeline is static\u2014it has been chosen during the training phase), but a shift of specialization is possible depending on the data it is fed with (54, 56)."

            "text": "Clinical cognitive reasoning is a field of research in its own right. In this article, we have specified how the clinical decision pertains to each of these steps. However, the way of using the embodied clinical model also has parallels with the embodied model of the engineer ML and the ML algorithm.\nIndeed, clinicians use each set of variables for each patient, i.e., they build as many models as there are cases, based on their theoretical rules. Thus, clinicians can rely more or less on theoretical hypotheses or on data presented to them in the clinical practice, in order to build their model. Consequently, they can either strongly constrain their data with predefined laws in a theory-driven manner, or on the contrary use clinical reasoning by trial and error in a data-drivenmanner (e.g., constraining their model with descriptive categorical criteriological approaches).\nOn the contrary, ML engineers always try to balance their theoretical knowledge with regards to the data. Indeed, significant parts of the model of the engineer rely on rules that depend on data distributions and tasks (26, 32).\nRegarding ML models, when they are put into production, the only parameter that could be set regarding their degree of freedom is the choice to fine train the model with the new samples, and if so, the importance to give to them (54, 56)."

Indeed, other challenges, such as the cost of a clinician to society, necessarily influence clinical practice. For instance, on a day of hospital consultation, clinicians should have seen a certain number of patients in consultation, requiring that they limit the time dedicated to each of them. Thus, cost and time are two intrinsically related uncontrollable factors that should be considered in the clinical modeling of practitioners.\nThe same factors shape the engineers work, but through another temporality: these factors influence the ML engineer and ML system during the design of the ML model, not during its use. In fact, both the engineers salary and the number of projects they are working on may affect the way they code. For instance, engineers could limit themselves to pre-coded pipelines [such as the Python library Sci-kit learn (57)] because of lack of time, whereas some solutions could have worked better but would have required more time. Time and cost factors also influence the precision of the parameters of the ML model, e.g., through the material needed to accelerate their computation (e.g., GPU cost).\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 5 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 926286"

For instance, these pressures and requirements are more or less burdensome depending on novice decision makers or experienced clinicians\u2014the latter theoretically resisting conflicts and external constraints. Finally, beyond the external constraints, clinicians work voluntarily in an interdisciplinary manner. Such an issue requires compromises on the part of clinicians, who find themselves at the intersection of external viewpoints and which modifies their clinical judgment.\nThe same constraints can be applied to ML engineers, depending on the specialization they come from and the environment they are working in.\nAn equivalent of interdisciplinarity for ML models could be transfer learning, in which a model trained on a specific model from one domain is fine-trained on new data and used in another task (58)."

            "text": "From this fruitful comparison emerges the idea that the understanding of AI does not only bringmethods to the clinician, but also sustains secondary benefits: due to the necessary decomposition of its operation (59), it supports educational issues for clinical practice. Thus, understanding how the ML works could inform clinical reasoning. Far from the possibility that psychiatric diagnosis no longer requires clinicians (60), the discipline can conversely rely on developments in ML reasoning to shed light on its own practice in a clever way.\nIn return, the understanding of such an embodied clinical model could help to understand the importance of the subjectivity of ML engineers. While this effect has already been documented in the literature [e.g., (10)], this comparison brought into light some of the factors involved in the choice of engineers when designing a ML model, continuing the deconstruction of the myth of a desubjectivized and neutral AI.\nSuch developments proposed in this article not only have an interdisciplinary scope, allowing for the understanding of the empirical practice of each of the disciplines (psychiatry and ML engineering), but also a transdisciplinary scope of clinical reasoning, providing newmethods for dialectically grasping what\ncannot be understood through the prism of a single discipline\u2014 even in interaction with another field.\nThis three-model dialog (embodied model of the psychiatrist, embodied model of the engineer and ML model) only partially considers, however, a crucial fourth actor: the embodied model of subjectivity of the patients. Like those presented in this perspective paper, the latter collects information through a theoretical background which is then processed with its own embodied model. Just as the comparison between clinical reasoning in psychiatry and reasoning in ML has led to the emergence of new methods for studying clinical decisionmaking, a dialog between these fields and the patients subjectivity would complement this transdisciplinary approach, while placing patient ethics at the center of the discussion.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nVM: writing, original draft preparation, conceptualization, and editing.
