1. **Investigate the synergistic effects of Citrus limon extract SNPs with other antimicrobial agents.**

The study showed that Citrus limon extract SNPs exhibited synergistic effects with antibiotics against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and antifungal strains. Future research could investigate the synergistic effects of Citrus limon extract SNPs with other antimicrobial agents, such as essential oils, plant extracts, and metal nanoparticles, to develop more effective antimicrobial formulations.


2. **Explore the use of Citrus limon extract SNPs for the treatment of other infectious diseases.**

The study demonstrated the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of Citrus limon extract SNPs against a limited number of microorganisms. Future research could investigate the efficacy of Citrus limon extract SNPs against a wider range of infectious agents, including viruses, parasites, and multidrug-resistant bacteria, to assess their potential for the treatment of other infectious diseases.


3. **Evaluate the safety and efficacy of Citrus limon extract SNPs in animal models of infection.**

The study showed promising results for the in vitro antimicrobial and antifungal activity of Citrus limon extract SNPs. Future research should evaluate the safety and efficacy of Citrus limon extract SNPs in animal models of infection to assess their potential for clinical use. This could involve studies to determine the optimal dosage, frequency of administration, and route of administration, as well as studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and efficacy of Citrus limon extract SNPs in vivo.


4. **Investigate the mechanisms of action of Citrus limon extract SNPs.**

The study did not investigate the mechanisms of action of Citrus limon extract SNPs. Future research could investigate the mechanisms by which Citrus limon extract SNPs exert their antimicrobial and antifungal effects. This could involve studies to determine the targets of Citrus limon extract SNPs within microbial cells, the pathways that are affected by Citrus limon extract SNPs, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of Citrus limon extract SNPs.


5. **Develop novel drug delivery systems for Citrus limon extract SNPs.**

The study did not investigate the development of drug delivery systems for Citrus limon extract SNPs. Future research could investigate the development of novel drug delivery systems, such as nanoparticles, microparticles, or liposomes, to improve the delivery of Citrus limon extract SNPs to target sites and enhance their antimicrobial and antifungal activity. This could involve studies to optimize the formulation and characterization of drug delivery systems for Citrus limon extract SNPs, as well as studies to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo performance of these drug delivery systems.
