    "abstractText": "The hippocampus is key to memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Previous work shows that neurons in the hippocampus fire in sequence to encode spatial information. The same group of cells will replay in memory consolidation, coupled with ripples, spindle, and slow waves. As for episodic memory, engram cells have been proposed to explain the encoding and transformation of episodic memory. Another universe theory about memory is the cognitive map theory. Here I use cognitive map theory as the bridge to overcome the gap between spatial and episodic memory. I believe spatial memory is a highly compressed case of episodic memory. In addition, I propose the hypothesis that engram can trigger sharp-wave ripples. I use a spike neural network-based computational model to verify this hypothesis. In conclusion, I believe engram cells and sharp-wave ripples are two different phenomena under a unified memory system. .

            "text": "When a new stimulus enters the brain, it is persisted and forms an underlying internal\nrepresentation. Afterward, this representation can be extracted, consolidated, eliminated,\nand manipulated. Researchers try to find the physical medium for this process. Eventually,\nthey discovered Engram. Memory engrams, also known as memory traces, were first\nproposed by Semon in his work. Semon defines memory engrams as \"stimulated, persistent,\nlatent modifications\" [1]. Since then, the concept of engrams has been further enriched by\nother researchers. Tonegawa is a representative scholar in this field.\nAccording to the previous work, engrams are considered the basic unit of memory. It\nis not equivalent to memory but is highly related to the formation of memory. More\nspecifically, Engram cells refer to a cell population that satisfies the following conditions\n[2]: (1) Cells that fire frequently during the learning process. To identify such cells,\nbiomarkers like c-Fos (an immediate early gene, IEG) can be used. (2) Cells that are\nchanged by the learning process and undergoing chemical or physical changes, such as the\nexcitability of cells, the density of dendrites and spines, and the strength of synapses. (3)\nBy activating these cells with external stimuli or optogenetics, related memory recall can\nbe triggered.\nEngram cells have primarily been studied under the behavioral paradigm of episodic\nmemory. A widely used behavioral paradigm for episodic memory is contextual fear\nconditioning (CFC) [3]. Engram cells are not only located in a specific brain region but are\nwidely distributed across the brain. This property suggests that memories are not\nrepresented by a specific brain region but are distributed encoded. As for the hippocampus,\nengram cells that are related to episodic memory are found in the DG area. Existing\nexperimental evidence about engrams can be divided into three levels, including\nobservation [4-5], inhibition [6-9], and manipulation [10-13]. This evidence clarifies that\nengrams are indeed mediators of memory formation and representation."

            "heading": "2. Memory Encoding \u2013 Sequential Firing and Replay",
            "text": "Another story about memory representation is sequential firing. Previous findings\nproved that spatial memory is encoded by the sequential firing of neurons in the CA area.\nThese cells are called place cells. Place cells always come up together with grid cells. They\nwork like the reference frame and coordinates. When a mouse runs forward in a maze, the\nEC cortex will form a map of the maze with grid cells. And the mouse can locate its location\nwith place cells in the hippocampus. As place cells are binding to a specific spatial location,\nthey always fire in sequence to encode the time-varying coordinates of the mouse. That is\nhow sequential firing comes into being.\nDuring offline states such as sleep, information in the hippocampus is replayed. Place\ncells in the hippocampus will fire in the same pattern as the exploration and learning period.\nThis is called replay. Replay is essential for memory consolidation which transfers\ninformation from the hippocampus into the isocortex. Experimental evidence shows that\ninterrupting the replay process will damage learning performance.\nTo answer the question of how neurons in the hippocampus encode external\ninformation, Daoyun Ji devised a spatial memory task to answer this question [14]. Mice\nwould run through a figure-of-eight maze, and the researchers recorded the activity of\nneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The results showed that neurons encode\nthe spatial information of the maze by firing sequentially. Furthermore, during sleep, the\nsame set of neurons fires in the same pattern, a phenomenon known as \"sequential replay.\"\nThe researchers found that neuronal replay is highly coupled to sharp ripples, and replay\noften occurs within sharp ripples."

            "text": "If engrams represent the basic unit of memory, the brain also needs grammar to\norganize these \"memory letters\". This kind of grammar is called neural syntax, and its\nspecific manifestation is brain rhythms or neural oscillation [16]. There are many different\nrhythmic oscillations in the brain, ranging from sharp-wave ripples, spindles, to slow waves.\nThe mutual coupling between nerve rhythms of different frequencies creates a hierarchical\nstructure. This hierarchy provides a communication protocol for nerve impulses from\ndifferent regions.\nRipples were first observed by Cornelius Vanderwolf in 1969, after which John\nO'Keefe discovered place cells associated with sharp ripples [15]. Buzsaki then studied the\nrole of sharp ripples in detail [16]. Sharp wave ripples are a compound waveform that\noccurs in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is an area of the brain associated with\nmemory and learning, and sharp wave ripples are also thought to be involved in the\nconsolidation and retrieval of memories.\nSharp wave ripples are one of the characteristic waves during slow wave sleep [17].\nAccording to different characteristic waves, sleep can be divided into REM sleep and non-\nREM sleep. Non-REM sleep can be further divided into several stages, of which stages 3-\n4 are called slow-wave sleep (Slow-wave Sleep, SWS). Slow wave sleep has three\ncharacteristic waves, including sharp wave ripples from the hippocampus, spindle waves\nfrom the thalamus, and slow waves from the cerebral cortex.\nSharp ripples, spindles, and slow waves all occur in slow-wave sleep, and there must\nbe some connection between them. According to Feld et al. [18], these three waves are\nphase-locked during sleep. Spike ripples accompany the replayed message, synchronized\nwith the spindle excitation period of the thalamus. The spindles themselves are\nsynchronized with the ascending phase of the cortical slow waves. During non-REM sleep,\nthe synchronization of these three waves establishes a pathway of information from the\nhippocampus to the cerebral cortex."

            "text": "S Diekelmann proposed a two-stage memory consolidation model (Diekelmann &\nBorn, 2010). During the wake stage, outside information is encoded by the cortex based on\npre-existing long-term memory and the hippocampus will form temporary memory. Then\nduring SWS sleep, the temporary memory will be reactivated in the form of replay for\nmemory consolidation. After that, during REM sleep, synapsis will be consolidated and\nnormalized.\nAs an important process of the memory system, memory consolidation is highly related\nto memory engrams and neural oscillations. Memory consolidation refers to the process of\ntransforming the temporary and unstable representation of external information entering\nthe brain into a more stable and structured long-term representation [19]. This process can\nbe divided into two levels, namely the cellular level and the systemic level. At the cellular\nlevel, the representation of information depends on physical or chemical updates of the cell\nstate [20-21]. and changes in the strength of synapses [19]. At the system level, the initial\nrepresentation of memory will be further abstracted and transformed, especially in the\noffline state. This process involves communication and cooperation between several brain\nregions. Information flows between regions, incorporating new memories into existing\nones. During this process, engram cells change. According to existing research, engrams\nare highly dynamic and can undergo bidirectional transformation between silent and active\nstates. Memory consolidation is compared with the maturity of engrams. Engram cells will\ntransform from silent into active during the consolidation process [22]. This phenomenon\nhappens across multi-areas including the hippocampus [23-24], mPFC, and BLA [25].\nAs for spatial memory, Gabrielle Girardeau devised a reward-based behavioral\nparadigm for spatial memory consolidation [26]. Mice will be shocked either during the\nsharp ripple (experimental group) or after the sharp ripple (control group). The results\nshowed that when the sharp wave ripples were disturbed, the mice performed worse on a\nspatial memory task. This experiment demonstrates that sharp wave ripples play an\nessential role in spatial memory consolidation."

Experimental evidence shows that sequential firing\nand sharp-wave ripples are always coupled. And sequential firing is found in spatial\nmemory encoding in the hippocampus area with place cells. However, engram cells are\nabout episodic memory like a contextual-based reward or aversion memory. Lucky,\nsequential firing, sharp-wave ripples, and engram cells all have been observed in the\nhippocampus. Here I argue that\nAnimals are natively drawn on profits and avoid loss. They can learn in which\nenvironment there will have a higher chance to find food or enemies. This is called episodic\nmemory. Animals also have spatial memory since they need to remember where is their\nhome and where can collect resources. On the one hand, place cells are spatial in their\nnature, so perhaps the replay is a spatial-specific phenomenon. On the other hand, since\nthe circuit and cellular machinery for the spatial replay are already in place, it is possible\nother types of memory can use this machinery if they also have a sequential pattern. This\nhas not been sufficiently studied before.\nHere we use cognitive map theory to merge that fork of spatial memory and episodic\nmemory. We argue that spatial memory is a special case of episodic memory. As it is\nmentioned in the cognitive theory and Buzaski\u2019s work [16]. The brain uses a relative\nrelationship to encode this world. We argue that the brain uses graph structure to represent\nthe episodic context. Spatial memory, as a spatial case, is a well-formed graph with\nlimitations. Spatial memories are always represented as a chain (straight channel) or\nhoneycomb-like grid (open field).\nWhen a mouse runs on the ground, its spatial memory is a time-varying trace. This\nproperty leads to sequential firing phenomena observed in the hippocampus. However,\nepisodic memory is much more complex. Features in context are much more enriched\ncompared with simple coordinates in the open field. Thus, the relationship represented by\nthe brain will be much more complex. Discover such a pattern is more computationally\nexpensive compared with a simple chain-like structure. This might be the reason why\nencoding patterns about episodic memory is not discovered in the experiment yet.\nSpatial memory is a special case of episodic memory. Every frame in the spatial memory is\ncompressed into a single coordinate point. That\u2019s why sequential firing can be observed.\nAccording to the cognitive map theory, everything can be represented by a relation\nmap. In every temporal frame, episodic memory can be encoded by a static graph. The\ngraph can evolve dynamically to reflect the temporal variance of the context (As shown in\nFigure 2 Top Right Corner). The corresponding neuron firing pattern is more complex\nrather than simple sequential firing. Here I believe spatial memory is a kind of highly\ncompressed episodic memory. In spatial memory, detailed context information is ignored\nand only a single coordinate is recorded. This is why we can find sequential firing in spatial\nmemory: it is a kind of highly abstract context that only keeps coordinate information."

In the traditional experiment, engrams are a kind of spatial pattern in the DG area. The temporal property of engrams is not well-studied. In my hypothesis, the engram can trigger sharpwave ripples. In the meanwhile, some papers believe that sharp-wave ripples can trigger sequential firing. Here I argue that it is a reasonable system to store information static in the form of spatial patterns (engram) and extract information with dynamic activities (sequential firing).\nThis paper believes that the working mode of forming a firing sequence through an\ninitial stimulus is in corresponds with the phenomenon in nonlinear dynamics and the current attractor theory. Such modes enhance the reliability of neural encodings while preserving plasticity. Representing and storing sequences in the form of initial values, and using plastic manifold spaces to decompress the initial points is a faster way to represent, store, and read information efficiently. As shown in Figure 3, the encoder encodes the information and maps it to an initial point on the manifold surface. The trajectory of the initial point is described by a nonlinear dynamical system, which produces a trajectory over time. This trajectory is then sampled by the decoder, generating a sequential output. Within the framework of this model, the activation of engram cells sets the initial value. Under the description of the nonlinear dynamic equation, the initial value is decompressed into a trajectory unfolding with time, which also generates sequential information. This sequential information is the sequential firing observed in the experiment.\nIn previous work, it was proposed that the hippocampus can be considered an autoencoder, and the theory is extended here in conjunction with a dynamic autoencoding model. The encoder sets an initial value on the manifold, and the subsequent movement of the initial coordinates is described by a nonlinear dynamical system. Its time-varying motion trajectory is sampled by the decoder to generate a sequential output.\nThis conceptual model is supported by many studies. Benna et al. [28] argue that the\nentorhinal cortex and hippocampus constitute an autoencoder. Jaffe et al. [29] proposed a task-dependent dynamic self-variational encoder [30] to model human behavior. The encoding from an initial point to a trajectory is a universal computational principle in the\nbrain. In the field of motion control, Wang et al. [31] mentioned that the motor cortex generates temporal motion commands according to the dynamic evolution of the trajectory by setting the initial value. In the field of value coding and decision-making, Okazawa et al. [32] found that population neuron coding forms a manifold space in the lateral parietal cortex. In the computational model of working memory, Bi et al. [33] believed that the track length encoded the delay time between different stimulus signals. This paper argues that memory consolidation and representation can also be included under the framework of this universal computational principle."

Excitatory and inhibitory cells play a role in homeostasis. As shown in Figure 4, there are a large number of projections from the DG area to CA3 and then to CA1, forming a tri-synaptic loop. The sharp waveripples phenomenon is similar to the damped oscillation phenomenon. Thus, activation of engrams in the DG region may introduce an additional input in the CA3 region [34]. Inputs to the DG disrupt the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the CA, producing ripples. And the forward sharp wave will also induce the chain firing of neurons along the way, realizing the phenomenon of sequential firing. In short, the sharp-wave ripples might be an energy dissipation phenomenon in the excitatory-inhibition balanced system.\nThe DG-CA3-CA1 connectivity pathway is referred to as the tri-synaptic pathway. A multicompartment model is used for the CA3 and CA1 regions. Arrows represent projection relationships. Orange represents inhibitory and blue represents excitatory.

The CA3 and CA1 regions are considered as an entirety.

The charge brought by the drive current will be stored by the neuron in the form of membrane potential and released in the form of the action potential. From this perspective, the whole model of the hippocampus can be thought of as a capacitor.\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc49 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc66 + \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52 (1)\nBoth CA3 and CA1 contain two groups of neurons, excitatory neurons and inhibitory\nneurons. Simply thinking about the relationship between the two groups of neurons, we can know that they constitute a self-feedback stable system. The self-feedback system can be simply extended to the analysis of charge storage. Taking the CA1 region as an example, the input of the Schaffer pathway leads to an increase in the membrane potential of excitatory neurons. An increase in the membrane potential of excitatory neurons leads to an increase in the membrane potential of inhibitory neurons, thereby inhibiting the increase in the membrane potential of excitatory neurons. The increased energy can be released in the form of higher firing frequency of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In the\nmeantime, the whole system maintains a stable state. In other words, the two groups of neurons work in antagonism. But something will change in the system. A higher rate of action potential firing leads to more charges being consumed. But the entire system maintains a dynamic balance, and the amount of charges will not accumulate infinitely.\nFrom the perspective of energy, sharp-wave ripples are the result of the energy\nexplosion. Therefore, a reasonable deduction is that the generation of sharp-wave ripples must be accompanied by a decrease in the amount of stored charge in the neuron population. It has also been found that the synchronous firing of CA1 inhibitory neurons can induce the generation of sharp-wave ripples [35]. This phenomenon can also be explained from the perspective of charge storage. If the CA1 area is regarded as a capacitor, it is assumed that its input from CA3 does not change but an external input enhances the firing of inhibitory neurons in the CA1 region. This leads to a decrease in the overall action potential firing rate in the CA1 region, resulting in an increase in stored charge. Sudden cessation of external input in the CA1 region will cause excitatory neurons to fire in bursts. By releasing excessive charge, sharp-wave ripples will be generated. Based on this mechanism, sharpwave ripples can also be induced by a sudden increase in external input, and this phenomenon has also been successfully observed in a computational model."

Please refer to supplementary materials for more details about the computational model. By simulating neuronal activity in the hippocampus over 4 s, we recorded the membrane potential of neurons in the CA1 region. Local field potentials were calculated based on membrane potentials. Energy density measurements are performed on the field potential to identify sharp ripple events. The result is shown in Figure 5.\nSharp-wave ripples detected in computational models of the hippocampus. The blue curve is a sharp wave, which is obtained by bandpass the local field potential signal from 5 Hz to 20 Hz. The orange curve is the ripple, which is obtained by bandpass the field potential signal from 80 Hz to 180 Hz. The yellow horizontal line is the baseline, representing zero potential.\n- Trigger Sharp-Wave Ripples by Temporary Enhanced Input\nThe paradigms above provide a possible mechanism for the generation of sharp-wave\nripples from the perspective of neuron population charge. Based on this mechanism, a reasonable inference can be drawn: the disturbance brought by the input of the DG area disrupts the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the CA1 and CA3 areas, resulting in sharp-wave ripples. To test this hypothesis, the following experiments were performed in a computational model of the hippocampus. As shown in Figure 4, DGCA3-CA1 constitutes a tri-synaptic pathway. Activation of engram cells in the DG will lead to temporarily enhanced input of the Mossy pathway. This paper simulates the activation of engram cells in the DG region by artificially changing the input current intensity of the CA3 region. Through experiments, it was found that the temporary enhancement of the Mossy pathway can induce the generation of sharp-wave ripples. As shown in Figure 6, the drive current in the CA3 area is shown by the orange curve, and it will switch between 2.3\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc34~3\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc34 in a period of 1 second. The blue curve is the local field potential in the CA1 area.\nThe blue line represents the local field potential of the CA1 region, and the orange line represents the input drive current of the CA3 region. The drive current fluctuates between 2.3~3 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc34 with a period of 1s to simulate the temporary enhancement of DG input.\nAs the input from the DG region switches between augmented and normal input on a\none-second cycle, the probability of sharp-ripple events in the CA1 region changes. In this paper, the activity of the hippocampal region was simulated for 4 s each time, and after 40 repetitions, the frequency of sharp-wave ripples in the CA1 region was detected. The results are shown in Figure 7, the occurrence frequency of sharp ripples in the enhanced input period is significantly higher than that in the normal input period. This result supports the hypothesis that temporarily enhanced input to the DG region can induce sharp-wave ripples. Another possibility is that the enhanced input itself causes more sharp-wave ripples. After experimenting with the computational model, it is found that the absolute value of the drive current does not determine the frequency of sharp ripples. The key factor is the step switch of the drive current.\nStats graph and hypothesis testing proved that temporary enhancement of DG input can trigger sharpwave ripples in the CA1 area. Run 4 s simulation 40 times. ***p < 0.001, Wilcox test."

Previous studies show that\nripples, spindles, and slow waves will synchronously transform information between the\nhippocampus and cortex.\nThe engram cell theory was first proposed by Semon, and Tonegawa further developed\nthis theory, which was supported by experimental evidence at three levels: observation,\nloss of function, and gain of function. The long-term enhancement theory has revealed the\nneural mechanism of memory and learning at the cellular level. Engram formation is\ndependent on long-term potentiation, an increase in dendritic spines, and an increase in\ncellular excitability. Multiple brain regions are involved in this process, including the\nhippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and basolateral amygdala. Various regions\ncomplete this process through cooperation and produce a joint effect. However, there are\nstill many questions to be answered. Questions for further research include how to achieve\nretrieval, consolidation, and representation of different memories in a unified system. At\nthe same time, we also need to explore the information exchange mode of engram cells in\ndifferent brain regions and understand the role of engram cells in different types of memory.\nTo better study these topics, we need more advanced neural recording technology and more\nrefined neural manipulation methods. Future studies will use higher temporal and spatial\nresolution methods to explore the changes of engram cells during learning and the\nformation of different types of memories.\nLike wave-particle duality, static engram cells and dynamic sequential firing should\nbe regarded as two representations of the same memory system. If the engram cell theory\nis regarded as a static memory mark, the sharp-wave ripples and the accompanying\nsequential replay can be regarded as a dynamic representation with highly temporal\ncharacteristics. The main research on the replay phenomenon has focused on spatial\nmemory, while the research on engram cells has focused on episodic memory. But this\npaper thinks that these two forms should be equivalent and have a causal relationship.\nThis paper analyzed the generation mechanism of sharp-wave ripples from the\nperspective of computational neuroscience. Combining the charge perspective and the self-\nfeedback mechanism, the possible reasons for the sharp-wave ripples are expounded. Based\non this mechanism, this paper proposes the hypothesis that the activation of engram cells\ncan induce sharp wave ripples, and has been verified in a computational model. In addition,\nthis hypothesis can be verified by observing the engram and sequence firing at the same\ntime. The verification experiment needs to be conducted by other researchers. At the model\nlevel, I hope to answer the following questions: 1) Different engram cells correspond to\ndifferent memories, how to make different engram cells activate different sequence replays\nin the model? 2) How to add new memory engrams to the existing network model? 3) How\ndo old engrams affect the representation of new engrams in the hippocampus?"

It can be divided into two types: one is the connection probability that is inversely proportional to the distance (as shown in Equation 1-5), and the other is the uniform connection probability that is independent of distance. The projections of CA3 inhibitory neurons are distance-independent uniform projections, and the others are distance-dependent connection probabilities. See the attached Table 3 for specific parameters. See attached table 4 for the relationship between model scale and spatial location, n represents the number of neurons, and d represents the distance between neurons.\nunit system is used by default.
