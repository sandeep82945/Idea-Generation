    "abstractText": "Anthropogenic climate change and its planetary and human consequences constitute an evolving public health crisis. There is a debate about the identity of psychiatry and its proper roles. One question pertains to how much focus the profession should place on the evolving planetary crisis of climate change. Psychiatry\u2019s role has been criticized as too narrow and even as overly reductionistic [2]. Two of us (A.M. B., J. C.), along with colleagues, recently presented our perspective on this debate and proposed that psychiatry\u2019s identity is a necessarily broad and complex concept [3]. In this light, climate change is indeed an important part of psychiatrists\u2019 agenda [3, 4]. Psychiatrists should support efforts to teach medical students [5] and residents [6] about the consequences of climate change for health and disease, as well as learn about the range of sciences and their methods that contribute to the understanding of climate change and its impacts. A special focus is to learn about how to prevent and ameliorate the psychological health impacts and to direct resources to these needs. In an earlier editorial, two of us (J. C., A. M. B.) proposed a framework for organizing the myriad ways in which psychiatry can contribute to addressing climate change [4]. We introduced the acronym CARE for outlining the components of the framework, which stands for clinical, administrative, research, and educational initiatives. Regarding the educational initiatives, for example, we proposed opening pathways for medical students and residents to specialize in the study of climate change. We wrote that we should demonstrate by example that our profession takes climate change seriously and that psychiatrists should encourage others to look for ways to act too. In our view, however, ourmodel fell short in a critical way.We omittedmention of how psychiatrists\u2019 personal behaviors, outside the work environment, should be considered in the call to action. Our intent in this editorial, therefore, is to argue that personal, individual behaviors are a critically important component of professional identity when responding to the urgent challenges posed by climate change. A second goal is to present some of the ways in which psychiatrists can individually make a difference outside work settings. For this purpose, we wrote to members of the Academic Psychiatry editorial board to solicit their views and ideas on this matter. We were guided by the assumption that an individual\u2019s behaviors in mitigating climate change will encourage others to follow. In the same way, experts believe that policies of the United States to reduce emissions could induce reciprocity from other countries [7] and that the activism of hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren across the world has positively inspired millions of adults [8]. Our hope and anticipation, therefore, is that everyone will further engage with and adopt some of the ideas for making a difference here, and we presume that to do so is necessarily in keepingwith psychiatrists\u2019 professional identity.",

Dobson et al. [10] challenged a false dichotomy that a focus on individual behaviors when fighting climate change detracts from the necessary system changes. One of us (ALS) [11] wrote that academic psychiatrists can and should take both individual and collective action to address the challenge of climate change.\nAdvice as to how to do so has been provided to doctors in their home lives [12, 13], including when on the way to work [14], as well as to members of individual professional societies [15, 16]. Practical actions include driving less, cycling or walking, using public transportation, actively recycling, spending vacations closer to home, seeking out locally grown food, consuming less meat, and reducing food wastage [12\u201314]. General practitioners have been counseled to demonstrate leadership by reducing air travel, increasing the consumption of plant-based foods, switching to a green electricity provider, and using public transport [15]. Gastroenterologists have been advised to consider what goes into their individual carbon footprint and to promote community efforts to reduce climate change [16].\nOne small survey of academic pediatricians found, in fact, that many were already taking action [17]. Respondents reported that they regularly tuned their cars, avoided idling when waiting to pick up or drop off passengers, and had avoided at least one trip by airplane in the prior 12 months. Many also reported that they had avoided eating meat at least 1 day per week and planned meals carefully to avoid waste. Many also looked for opportunities to become energy efficient at home by recycling paper, glass, aluminum, and plastic and replacing incandescent lightbulbs with LED bulbs [17]. Individual actions do matter, and change begins at home [18]."

            "text": "We wrote to members of the Academic Psychiatry editorial board to inquire about their views on the role of their personal behaviors and as role models in mitigating climate change. We considered them a convenience sample of academic psychiatry leaders aligned with the mission of the journal. We also inquired about their personal responses, if any, by providing them with explicit examples of what they could do, given a range of recommendations provided to physicians for those purposes [12\u201317]. With approval by the Baylor Institutional Review Board, we asked seven questions and received richly detailed responses from 10 of 16 editorial board members. Here we describe those questions and a selection of illustrative responses.\nWe first asked, \u201cHow important, if at all, are personal behaviors (e.g., using public transportation, dietary modifications, reducing the use of energy in the home) of an academic psychiatrist in mitigating climate change?\u201d Answers\nconsistently affirmed the importance, even critical importance, of personal behaviors. One wrote, though, that the behavior of psychiatrists is no more important than any other global stakeholder, and two others wrote that personal behaviors were important as responsible citizens or as a good human but not related to being an academic psychiatrist in this context.\nWe next asked, \u201cHow do you view the relationship, if any, between your own personal behaviors and your role in professional advocacy on climate change?\u201d The answers were mixed. One responded that advocacy and personal behavior are distinct and unrelated and another that there was no such direct relationship in that realm. Two wrote that \u201cwe should practice what we preach,\u201d that these notions were intimately related or should be aligned. Another noted that the relationship is significant because residents do look at how attendings conduct themselves.\nA third question asked, \u201cTo what extent do you view yourself as a role model for your patients and their families in the behaviors you adopt to mitigate climate change outside of your professional or work role?\u201d The answers tended to be negative. Two respondents, for example, did not identify as a role model for climate change, and another had not considered this question. Some responded that they did not discuss their personal lives with patients and their families, at least consistently, or, alternatively, that patients might not be aware of those behaviors. One responded that being an academic psychiatrist did not bestow any power as a role model. One asserted that physicians should not be role models for patients in their personal behaviors to mitigate climate change. Alternatively, physicians should lend their power, privilege, and expertise on the health effects of climate change to community-based organizations that are wholly focused on climate change and that physicians can partner with those organizations with humility to further structural reforms. Those organizations were described as highly impactful and as role models, whereas viewing physicians as role models risks overshadowing longstanding community-based movements and organizations. A couple of respondents did view themselves as role models to patients, however, with one noting that patients can observe climate related behaviors.\nFourth, we asked, \u201cPlease indicate whether or not you have adopted any of the following activities related to transportation in part to mitigate climate change: reducing air travel for family vacations; biking, walking or carpooling to work; downsizing your car; purchasing an electric vehicle.\u201d All respondents identified at least one of these activities, and three reported that they had an electric or hybrid car, while another two were looking to invest in an electric car in the future.\nFifth, we asked, \u201cPlease indicate whether or not you have adopted any of the following activities related to diet in part to mitigate climate change: eating less meat or switching to a plant-based diet; reducing food waste (composting, food\ndonations); consuming more local foods and products.\u201d We received a range of responses, including reducing food waste, minimizing meat consumption, composting, buying locally grown or produced products, and donating food. One mentioned an effort to eat healthy more so for health benefits than for climate change, and another reported having made no dietary changes.\nSixth, we asked, \u201cPlease indicate whether or not you have adopted any of the following activities related to the consumption of energy in part to mitigate climate change: installing energy efficient bulbs; installing solar panels; downsizing your home.\u201d All had installed energy efficient bulbs, and answers also included reducing heat consumption by using fans, heat pumps, or space heaters and/or by reinstalling windows for greater efficiency.\nSeventh, we asked, \u201cPlease indicate whether or not you have made any changes in regard to your personal use of plastics given environmental concerns.\u201d Indeed, many had reduced their use of plastics. One wrote a detailed response to report taking reusable containers to restaurants for leftovers, preferring glassware over plastics, avoiding disposable crockery or cutlery, avoiding small packaging for foods, using reusable cling film or plastic wraps, minimizing online orders, using reusable straws, taking mugs to coffee shops, and not using bottled water at home."

            "text": "It has been suggested that even the act of completing a survey can be counted as an intervention and raise respondents\u2019 awareness about climate change [17]. As demonstrated, though, Academic Psychiatry editorial board members were already very much engaged in actions to mitigate climate change. We hope that their examples will encourage and support similar initiatives by others.\nFurthermore, should personal behaviors not be in line with professional society position statements and initiatives on climate change, those organizational positions risk becoming undermined and devalued. Conversely, solely relying on individual action is not advised when doing so will not accomplish much without system-level changes and support from leadership in large academic health centers. The American Psychiatric Association, for example, is committed to addressing climate change and its consequences [19, 20], and it has directed resources to do so while working in concert with a variety of other organizations, including the Climate Psychiatry Alliance [20].\nWe therefore wish to update the acronym for outlining the components of the framework for organizing how psychiatry can respond to climate change. Because individual behaviors provide a foundation for collective action, we propose to modify it to ICARE where the \u201cI\u201d stands for individual or personal\naction. Greta Thunberg, whose quote leads this editorial [1], illustrates this principle well. She sailed across the Atlantic in 2019 to take part in two major climate summits held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York [21].\nOne of our starting points for this editorial was to suggest that personal behaviors are a critically important component of professional identity when responding to the urgent challenges posed by climate change. Our Academic Psychiatry respondents were at best mixed on answers to these questions, with some viewing their behaviors as not important in this context. Some also viewed their behaviors as unrelated to any role in professional advocacy on climate change.\nTo conclude, we assert that psychiatrists\u2019 identity is not confined to the doors of their offices, hospitals, or medical schools. Instead, the identity of psychiatrists incorporates active engagement and behaviors in wider societal problems, including those related to climate change. As scientists and evidence-based practitioners, psychiatrists have an especially important role to play in shaping the attitudes and behaviors of the public and should take full advantage of their trusted and privileged position in society. Indeed, this privileged professional status obligates psychiatrists to aim to conduct themselves with integrity in every aspect of their lives. Psychiatrists should aim, therefore, to behave as responsible citizens and role models in how they protect the planet in service of their patients and their families and in service of society at large. There is no time to waste: the house is on fire."
