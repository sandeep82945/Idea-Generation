    "abstractText": "Metaheuristic algorithms are effectively used in searching some optical solution space. for optical solution. It is basically the type of local search generalization that can provide useful solutions for issues related to optimization. Several benefits are associated with this type of algorithms due to that such algorithms can be better to solve many issues in an effective way. To provide fast and accurate solutions to huge range of complex issues is one main benefit metaheuristic algorithms. Some metaheuristic algorithms are effectively used to classify the problems and BAT Algorithm (BA) is one of them is more popular in use to sort out issues related to optimization of theoretical and realistic. Sometimes BA fails to find global optima and gets stuck in local optima because of the absence of investigation and manipulation. We have improved the BA to boost its local searching ability and diminish the premature problem. An improved equation of search with more necessary information through the search is set for the generation of the solution. Test set of benchmark functions are utilized to verify the proposed method\u2019s performance. The results of simulation showed that proposed methods are best optimal solution as compare to others.",

Optimization [2] is process of obtaining best solution of any problem either by using [3] minimization or maximization function, while specifying underline constraints [4] Proposed a new technique to verify the selection of features for using text clustering [5] they describe method to apply feature selection of several data of different time series to discover and apply robotic [6,7]. The research work [8] has described their research f or optimization process that use defined objectives and fitness f unctions. Such fitness functions help to interested parameters and some constraints to give solid solution for issues. Currently optimization has rich scope in everyday life such as business, management or engineering design that reduce the cost, time and resources also to improve the performance, accurate results, good profit [9]. The principle objectives of providing optimized solution are Design variables i.e., a numerical input that will change during the process of optimization; Objective function i.e., describes main motive of the function i.e., either to be minimize or maximize, depending upon nature of problem; Constraints i.e., conditions that must be satisfied while solving the problem and Standard Formulation i.e., representation of problem in mathematical notation. Optimization problems exist in all fields. To solve optimization problems related to engineering disciple which mostly includes designing of hardware components\nSensors 2022, 22, 9513. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22239513 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nand circuits, planning and scheduling of production, quality controlling, providing main tenancy and repairing of hardware equipment\u2019s [9,10] many optimization methods were proposed in past and proven to be beneficial for solving specific set of problems. Benchmark functions have rich scope in evolutionary optimization field multi programming applications used for optimized solution like stochastic programming applications deals issues of optimizing uncertainty, Hill Climbing programming applications to solve mathematical optimizations issues, constraint programming applications use to identify feasible optimized solution from a large set, Goal based programming application help to find which task are specified to perform, by assigning weights to objectives is use to give value to specific targets, by applying sequential optimization techniques use for selection of multi functions, Gradient based techniques and Linear Programming applications use to find weights and linear function combination. Optimization issues become complex and are increasing frequently,Computational traceability issues occur when global optimal solution is not provided.Despite of computationally extensive and without any guarantee of obtaining optimal solution, metaheuristic approaches are still preferred by many researchers for providing solutions to problems. Though metaheuristic approaches offer many benefits like ease of development and applicable to variety of problems. Even the convergence rate of metaheuristic approaches is better than other optimization approaches [11]. The research work [12] proposed a novel hybrid bat direct search algorithm (HBDS) to resolve integer programming by integrating the bat algorithm with direct search methods. The global modification and the local evolution process were balanced in HBDS. The evolution ability of the proposed algorithm is improved by applying the pattern search method for local searching in place of the random walk method. Finally, the Nelder-Mead technique was utilized to enhance the best solution generated from the bat and pattern search method. The BDS algorithm was studied on 7 integer programming problems and 10 benchmark algorithms of integer programming problem solving to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulated outcomes depicted that HBDS is a capable algorithm and beats the other algorithms in terms of efficiency. Directional echolocation was presented in terms of standard BA in [13] to overcome early convergence, which enhanced the manipulation and investigation capabilities of the standard BA. Three improvements in standard BA refined the performance. The designed method named Directional BA Algorithm (dBA) was evaluated by several functions from a CEC\u20192005 standard suite. The experimental results from the simulation determined that dBA is superior to others. Ref. [14] the author has applied Standard BA to solve non-linear problems. The proposed algorithm attained better results in comparison to existing metaheuristic techniques."

Multidirectional location optimization is embedded in the bat algorithm to enhance its exploitation and exploration capabilities and consequently significantly enhances the BA performance. The original version of the bat algorithm has two parameters that can be controlled. One is the loudness and another one is the pulse rate. We introduce the values of direction and three other modifications to make an improvement over the original version of the bat algorithm. The lack of exploration capabilities result in a premature convergence of the BA when looking for an optimal solution, which needs to be resolved by introducing a multidirectional exploration."

BAT algorithm has number of parameters that play important role in order to optimize the problem under consideration. Position updation, velocity updation, frequency updation, global position updation,pulse rate updation processes in the BAT algorithm are discussed as under. For instance, observing an unconstrained optimization problem.\nmin( f (x)), x \u2208 R (1)\nwhere minimization objective function is denoted by f : Rn \u2192 R is and a vector x signifies a decision variable. Also, x \u2208 S \u2282 Rn and S represents the explore-able space, it is n-dimensional and the parametric constraints are:\nli \u2264 xi \u2264 ui i = 1, 2, 3 . . . , n (2)\nwhere li is the lower bound, xi is location, xi. The position updation of BAT\u2019s uses following equation:\nxi(t + 1) = xi(t) + vi(t + 1) (3)\nwhere xi(t + 1) is new position, xi(t) is old position of ith BAT, vi(t + 1) is the velocity. The velocity updation equation equation is\nvi(t + 1) = vi(t) + (xi(t)\u2212 p(t)). fi (4)\nwhere vi(t) is old velocity and xi(t) is position, p(t) is the global optim, fi is the frequency. The frequency can be updated by using following equation\nfi = fmin + ( fmax \u2212 fmin).\u03b2 (5)\nwhere fmin is the minimum frequency , fmax is maximum frequency , \u03b2 is random amplification factor taken from (0, 1). The BA can search globally and locally dependent upon its boundaries; therefore, it is essential to attain an equilibrium among local and global searching abilities by implementing flexible parameters. The local search formula works as follows:\nxi(t + 1) = \u2192 p (t) + eA(t) (6)\nwhere e ranges between [\u22121, 1], = \u2192p (t) is global optima and A(t) is the mean value of loudness of the whole population.\nThe global searching is accomplished by regulating loudness Ai(t + 1) and pulse rate.\nAi(t + 1) = \u03b1Ai(t) (7)\nwhere ri(t + 1) and \u03b1 are parameters with non-zero positive value.\nri(t + 1) = ri(0)[1\u2212 exp(\u03b3t)] (8)\nwhere \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b3 > 0 are constants and Ai(0) and ri(0) are primary values of loudness and pulse rate, respectively.\nThe Pseudo-Code of BAT algorithm is given as follows\n1. For every bat i, set the position, velocity, and parameters that arbitrarily yield the frequency using Equation (5).\n2. Calculate and replace the new position and velocity of bat i using Equations (3) and (4). 3. Then, generate rand1 ranging between [0, 1]. If rand1 < ri(t), calculate temporary position and use utility function to calculate fitness value for ith bat using Equation (6). 4. Again, generate another rand2 ranging between [0, 1]. If rand2 < Ai(t) and f (xi(t)) < f (p(t)), then replace Ai(t) and ri(t) using values from Equations (7) and (8), respectively. 5. Sort all positions according to their fitness values and extract the optimum position. 6. Then move on to Step 2 if the stopping criteria is not reached."

            "text": "In 2010 a hug research work was done in the field of BAT algorithm and this era has large application of BAT algorithm due to that performance and implementation of BAT algorithm has become efficient.The presented algorithm attained better results in comparison to existing metaheuristic techniques. Meng et al. [15] introduced doppler effect in original BA. Author used Rechenberg\u2019s one fifth mutation rule and Gaussian probabilities function to enhance the ability of echolocation system. The author reported that their technique amplified movement of BA for searching global solution. In modified BA, author reformed the equation to calculate loudness and pulse emission rate for each bat. The modified bat algorithm (MBA) was tested on 15 benchmark functions and reported results were improved over standard BA. Huang et al. [16] reformed the procedure of local searching by presenting the Gaussian walk concept for bats. The author transformed the velocity update equation of standard BA which resulted in higher diversity in population. The searching dimensions in BA have surged by this method. The Cloud model BA (CBA) which merges the concept of cloud model into BA was introduced in 15 [17]. Cloud model is famous with its exceptional features of presenting abstruse knowledge. The author modified the echolocation model of BA with the help of transformation theory of cloud model. Also, developed an algorithm which showed better results on optimizations function. Compact bat algorithm (cBA) presented in [18] was studied for environments which had limited resources related to hardware. The design variable of search space solution was reformed with a probability-based population model. The author reported that this method can be implemented in limited memory environments. A mutation based unique bat algorithm with the help of image processing was presented by waqas et al. [19]. Two alterations were introduced in standard BA. First, frequency and loudness were considered to be fixed and second, for diversity of population, a mutation operator was developed. Tests were carried on image processing-based examples and reported that this technique provided better result as compared with original BA. This hybridization technique resulted in increasing the capacity of local search. Chakri et al. [14] enhanced the speed of convergence in BA by introducing the opposition- based numbering concept. The author simulated the revised algorithm for various benchmark functions. It was observed that the approach resulted in better accuracy as well as convergence speed for global search. The author in [20] enhanced the efficiency of standard BA in respect of convergence rate and accuracy. The concept of levy flights trajectory was presented which improved the diversity of population which resulted in making the solution to evacuate from local minima. A differential operator was also utilized to improve the convergence speed. The author simulated various scenarios on well-known benchmark functions and reported that their method can estimate better in high dimensional space. Garip et al. [21] implemented chaotic sequence for parameter adjustment in standard BA known as Chaotic BA (CBA). The author presented the impact of different chaotic sequences on convergence performance of standard BA. Simulation of the algorithm resulted in better performance of CBA over standard BA. Osaba et al. [22] proposed an improved Bat Algorithm called (DalBat). The author considered Hamming Distance (HC) to calculate the distance from one bat to another. Moreover, an additional method was implemented in the algorithm which depends on two structures of the neighborhood bats, the optimum searching agent in the population finds them. The author also stated that they considered the bat algorithm to resolve a problem from bioinformatics for the first time. Hong et al. [23] proposed a novel procedure to\ncompute the motion of the floating platform. A vector regression method was considered to simulate the movement of a floating platform and a novel BA was proposed to improve the operators of the method. Moreover, an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method was used to decompose the time series signal. The author also proved the reliability and activity of the proposed method. Primary issues of bat algorithm related to low convergence rate and trapping in local optima intrigued in [21] to enhance the performance of bat algorithm in terms of exploitation by using a variable dimension size. This process assisted to choose random values for the subsequent epoch and the chosen value overlooked representing impractical dimension region. The modified algorithm was validated on ten benchmark functions and the results showed that it performed better in terms of optimization.The research work [22] presented a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based bat algorithm called PCA-BA. Every searching agent is utilized when PCA is applied. It excludes the uncorrelated and the individuals in the population below threshold of similarity. The algorithm was tested on CEC\u20192008 benchmark functions and the results revealed that PCABA performed exceptionally well against basic bat algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm was also compared with other algorithms from literature in terms of optimization and showed better performance.Wang et al. in [24] considered eight selection approach based on fitness function value to proposed a unique algorithm named as MixBAT. The algorithms performance was validated using CEC\u20192013 benchmark functions and comparison with some other methods from literature. MixBAT attains the global optimum without being trapped in local optima. But, occasionally it gets trapped in a local optimum when other approaches could be invalid in the initial iterations. There are two constraints of innovative form of the Bat Algorithm that can be well-ordered. First one is s loudness and the second is as rate of pulse. Chakri et al. [14] strained direction values and some changes to improve the novel version of BAT algorithm. Lack of exploration capabilities results in premature convergence and minimized accuracy of BAt in finding optimal solution which is needed to be resolved by introducing multi-directional exploration"

In this research, the selection of an optimal target depended upon the range between the target and the bat and the direction in which the target was moving. In the proposed strategy, the distance along multiple directions was calculated to estimate the range between the target and the bat. The proposed algorithm was tested on standard benchmark functions in search of an optimal value. The experimental results were generated using parameter settings given in Section 4 of this paper. The results of the average fitness were reported for the proposed algorithm and two other standard state-ofthe-art algorithms, mixBA and EBA, for all functions. The proposed algorithm was helpful in escaping from local optima and showed a dominating performance compared with the mixBA and EBA algorithms. We used the best, worst, average and standard deviation of the average fitness results as shown in Table 1 of this paper. It can be concluded from the experimental results that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the other algorithms. The proposed technique can get out of local minimum and can solve the optimization issues in an effective and efficient way. Future work will memorize the convergence track and then utilize this information to further enhance the convergence speed of the bat algorithm.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, N.A.; Methodology, M.T.M.; Formal analysis, G.A.; Data curation, A.M.; Writing\u2014original draft, W.Y.; Writing\u2014review and editing, Q.A.; Funding acquisition, M.E.
