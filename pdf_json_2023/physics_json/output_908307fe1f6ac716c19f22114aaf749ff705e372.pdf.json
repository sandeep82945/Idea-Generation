    "abstractText": "Due to their structural and property tunability, semiconductive conjugated polymers (CPs) have emerged as promising candidates for photocatalytic water splitting. Compared with inorganic materials, the photocatalytic performance of mono-component polymers was limited by the fast recombination of photoexcited charge carriers, and they always needed to catch up to expectations. To this end, researchers established molecular donor\u2013acceptor heterostructures, which could notably promote oxygen production efficiency due to their more effective charge carrier separation. In this work, easy Schiff base reactions between side-chain -CHO groups and terminal -NH2 groups were used to introduce benzene and perylene diimide (PDI) into the molecular heterostructure to serve as electron donors (D) and electron acceptors (A). In particular, for the first time, we employed the molecular heterostructures of CPs to promote photocatalytic O2 production. One prepared molecular heterostructure was demonstrated to improve oxygen generation rate (up to 0.53 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121) through visible light-driven water splitting. Interestingly, based on the photoelectric properties, a stepwise two-electron/two-electron pathway constituted the photocatalytic mechanism for oxygen production with the molecular heterostructure. These results provide insights into designing and fabricating high-performance molecular heterostructures for photocatalytic oxygen production.",

            "text": "The solid worldwide energy dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels has triggered severe social and environmental problems, such as the energy crisis and global warming [1\u20136]. Motivated by natural photosynthesis, artificial photocatalytic systems provide promising routes to resolve energy-related problems by harnessing sunlight [7\u201310]. In 1980, inorganic materials (TiO2 electrodes) were, for the first time, reported to mediate the photoelectrochemical-induced water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen [11]. Until now, inorganic materials have been the most widely studied photocatalysts because of their high stabilities and charge carrier mobilities [12]. Compared with inorganic materials, conjugated polymers exhibit their specific advantages as another kind of photocatalyst [13\u201318]. For example, polymers are mainly composed of naturally abundant lightweight elements (i.e., C, N, O, and S, etc.), and both the architectures and properties of polymers could be easily tailored by delicate structure design [19]. However, most mono-component polymers suffer from low solar-to-oxygen conversion efficiencies due to the fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers [20,21]. Thus, exploiting the diversity of polymer structures to develop novel CPs with efficient photocatalytic properties is extremely important [10]. For inorganic materials, the heterojunction composed of two kinds of semiconductors with staggered absorption bands was demonstrated to expand the light absorption range and enhance the charge carrier mobility and separation efficiency, which, therefore, could further improve the conversion efficiency of solar energy [22\u201325]. As such, similarly, polymer heterojunctions [26\u201330] were constructed to optimize light absorption and enhance\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7500. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28227500 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7500 2 of 11\nexciton dissociation. For example, Shen et al. [31] developed three polymer heterojunctions composed of fluorene-based polymers and g-C3N4, which achieved an AQY of 27% under 440 nm of light irradiation. Li et al. first constructed molecular heterostructures based on covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) via a sequential polymerization strategy to produce H2. Molecular heterostructures of electron-accepting benzothiadiazole and electron-donating thiophene moieties showed much better photocatalytic properties than single-component polymers [32]. Photophysical and electrochemical characterizations indicated that, compared to mono-component polymers, the efficient charge separation with the molecular heterostructures can be more readily fabricated in principle by incorporating donor and acceptor units into different polymers\u2019 skeletons [32]. Herein, we developed a new polymer-based molecular heterostructure and explored its structure\u2013property relationship associated with light-induced water splitting into oxygen. As reported in [33], Zhu et al. disclosed that the crystalline perylene diamide (PDI)functionalized polymer (Urea-PDI) mediated active oxygen production without cocatalysts, with a high oxygen evolution rate (3223.9 \u00b5mol h\u22121 g\u22121) which was over 107.5 times as high as those of PDI-based supramolecular photocatalysts under visible light. We first synthesized PDI-based mono-component conjugated polymers (BPDI) via imide condensation [34] between p-phenylenediamine and 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic acid anhydride. BPDI exhibited subtle photoactivity for O2 production in water/DMF solution under visible light irradiation due to the deficient thermodynamic driving force. Then, 2,5-Dibromoterephthalaldehyde with 3,4-ethoxylene dioxy thiophene, benzene, and dibenzothiophene sulfone groups used to prepare the precursors was named BEDOT, BB, and BSO, respectively. Interestingly, three corresponding molecular heterostructures formed when three linear polymers (BEDOT, BB, and BSO) were covalently linked with BPDI by an aldimine condensation reaction. The enhanced photocatalytic properties of the targeted molecular heterostructures were attributed to the intrinsic merits of the molecular heterostructures, e.g., light absorption, photoluminescence (PL), transient photocurrent response, and charge carrier mobilities. Via delicate design of the precursors, the staggered band alignments of the molecular heterostructure could optimize the energy gaps of polymers to provide both broad photoresponse and enough driving force for light-induced water splitting. On the other hand, the abundant inter- and intramolecular donor-acceptor (D\u2013A) interactions and highly conjugated backbones of the molecular heterostructures could effectively enhance charge carrier mobility and separation efficiency, which were pivotal for enhancing photocatalytic performance. The prepared heterostructure BB/BPDI exhibited remarkable oxygen production rates of 0.53 mmol h\u22121 g\u22121 under visible light irradiation. This work demonstrates that molecular heterostructure is an efficient strategy to improve the photoactivities of conjugated polymers and provides insights into the design of high-performance photocatalysts in different fields."

BEDOT was prepared via Pd-catalyzed direct C-H arylation polymerization (DArP) between 3,4-ethoxylene dioxy thiophene (EDOT) and 2,5-dibromoterephthalaldehyde, with an equivalent feed ratio. For synthesizing molecular heterostructures, the BPDI was incorporated into BEDOT, BB, and BSO via Schiff base reaction (Scheme 1). Here, PDI and dibenzo[b,d]thiophene-5,5-dioxide were employed as electron-withdrawing units, while EDOT and benzene were used as substantial electron donors and weak electron donors, respectively.

With the charge transfer between the donor unit (benzene) and the acceptor unit (PDI), this staggered band alignment enabled the BB/BPDI to effectively absorb visible light and offer sufficient thermodynamic driving forces from the LUMO of BB. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Figure 3a) was used to gain insight into the capabilities of all polymers and probe their internal electron transfer dynamics. The light emission spectra of BEDOT, BB, and BSO exhibited a strong peak at 604 nm, 531 nm, and 530 nm, respectively, due to the fast recombination of the photogenerated electron and hole. In contrast, the PL intensities of the molecular heterostructures were quenched, and those molecular heterostructures exhibited similar PL intensities. The attenuated PL intensities of molecular heterostructures compared with mono-component linear polymers reflected that the photogenerated charge recombination in the molecular heterostructures was notably charge-suppressed [38]. Compared with mono-component linear polymers with D-A effects, molecular heterostructures with intermolecular D-A effects were designed to establish enhanced charge separation performance, which was\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7500 5 of 11\nattributed to the covalent bridge limiting the recombination of excitons between the donor units and acceptor units [32].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 12\ntures possessed much higher photocurrent densities than the linear CPs (BEDOT, BB, and\nBSO).

Unfortunately, the oxygen evolution rates of BPDI, BEDOT, BB, and BSO were\nnot found, which could be attributed to the rapid charge recombination or insufficient\nthermodynamic driving force. In particular, the rare photocatalytic activity of BPDI indi-\ncated that the mechanism for photocatalytic water splitting into oxygen was a stepwise\ntwo-electron/two-electron pathway [10]. Figure 4a presents the time-dependent hydrogen\nevolution curves, displaying a linear increase versus time for BEDOT/BPDI, BB/BPDI, and\nBSO/BPDI over five hours.

The molecular heterostructures BEDOT/BPDI and BSO/BPDI exhibited average photocatalytic activities of 0.31 and 0.08 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121, respectively. The\ncorrectly hybridized BB/BPDI exhibited an improved photocatalytic activity, with a maximum oxygen production value of 0.53 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 due to the excellent charge mobility\nand charge separation efficiency. It agrees with our preliminary optical and electrochem-\nical results for the molecular heterostructures.\nFigure 3. (a) Steady-state fluorescence spectra of the prepared CPs. (b) Transient photocurrent of the prepared CPs under full-arc light.\nIn ad ition, photocurrent measurements (Figure 3b) and electrochemical impedance spectra (Figure S4b) were performed. As shown in Figure 3b, the molecular heterostructures possessed much higher photocurrent densities than the linear CPs (BEDOT, BB, and BSO). In addition, the charge carrier density of BEDOT/BPDI was estimated to be higher than that of BSO/BPDI, which was attributed to the electron push\u2013pull effect between the donor and acceptor along the conjugate skeleton. BB/BPDI exhibited the highest current intensity at 0.84 \u00b5A cm\u22122. These results indicate that the molecular heterostructures with intermolecular D-A effects could effectively improve photogenerated charge carrier transfer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) also evidenced that BB/BPDI had a more negligible interfacial charge transfer resistance than BSO/BPDI and BEDOT/BPDI. The above results confirm that the efficient charge carrier transfer across the covalently limited molecular heterostructure was one of the decisive keys for the tremendous photocatalytic performance."

Infrared spectral measurement was carried out by making polymers with a KBr sheet on an FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker, ALPHA, Billerica, MA, USA) in transmission mode at room temperature. Morphologies of the polymers were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, MLA650F, Rock Hill, SC, USA) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2-20, Peabody, MA, USA). The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectrum was obtained by means of a scanning UVvis spectrophotometer (UV-2600, SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan) and BaSO4 as a reflectance sample. The photoluminescence of the polymers was measured with a fluorescence spectrometer (FL-1000, HORIBA, Shanghai, NJ, USA), with an excitation of 450 nm at room temperature.

Based on the staggered bandgap alignment of the band segment, the stepwise two-electron/two-electron pathway was proposed to explain the photocatalytic mechanism.
