 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a similar analysis on other common cancer types beyond lung and breast cancer to see if the findings hold true. Expanding the scope would improve generalizability. 

2. Incorporate real world data and longer-term follow-up data as they become available to re-evaluate correlations between costs and outcomes over time. The paper noted limitations in using only short-term trial data. 

3. Evaluate the impact of transparency of pharmacoeconomic evidence on the strength of the correlation between drug costs and benefits. The paper hypothesized greater transparency could strengthen associations.

4. Analyze the cost-effectiveness of negotiated prices for cancer drugs to optimize pricing further. This could identify if there is still room for improved value.

5. Develop more standardized methods for conducting and reporting cost-effectiveness analyses to enable easier comparisons across drug assessments. The paper noted this as an area for improvement.
