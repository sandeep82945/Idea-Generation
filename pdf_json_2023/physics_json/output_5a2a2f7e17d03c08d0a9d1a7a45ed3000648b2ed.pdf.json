    "abstractText": "The exceptionally high positive charge of the histones, concentrated in the Nand C-terminal tails, is believed to contribute to the stability of the nucleosome by neutralizing the negative charge of the nucleosomal DNA. We find, on the contrary, that the high positive charge contributes to instability, performing an essential function in chromatin remodeling. We show that the tails are required for removal of the histone octamer by the RSC chromatin remodeling complex, and this function is not due to direct RSC\u2013tail interaction. We also show that the tails are required for histone octamer transfer from nucleosomes to DNA, and this activity of the tails is a consequence of their positive charge. Thus, the histone tails, intrinsically disordered protein regions, perform a critical role in chromatin structure and transcription, unrelated to their well-known role in regulation through posttranscriptional modification.",

We find, on the contrary, that the high positive charge contributes to instability, performing an essential function in chromatin remodeling. We show that the tails are required for removal of the histone octamer by the RSC chromatin remodeling complex, and this function is not due to direct RSC\u2013tail interaction. We also show that the tails are required for histone octamer transfer from nucleosomes to DNA, and this activity of the tails is a consequence of their positive charge. Thus, the histone tails, intrinsically disordered protein regions, perform a critical role in chromatin structure and transcription, unrelated to their well-known role in regulation through posttranscriptional modification."

            "text": "Histones have a bipartite structure, with a globular region, responsible for coiling DNA in a \u2018core\u2019 nucleosome, and disordered amino- and carboxy-terminal \u2018tails\u2019, which protrude from the core nucleosome into solution. Although commonly viewed as DNA packaging proteins, histones serve primarily for the purpose of transcription control (1). The core nucleosome is a general repressor, preventing all transcription except that brought about by positive regulatory mechanisms. The tails are subject to extensive posttranslational modification, which modulates the state of transcriptional activity through both positive and negative regulatory mechanisms.\nThe histones are highly positively charged, with abundant lysine and arginine residues, about two-thirds of which are concentrated in the tails. The most common posttranslational modifications are acetylation and methylation of the lysine residues. About one-third of the lysine residues are modified in some chromosomal locations at some time, but not all at the same time, so the effect of modification on positive charge is small. With most of the histone positive charge retained at all times, there must be an-\nother role of the positive charge in chromosome structure and function. It is widely believed that the positive charge contributes to the stability of the nucleosome through interaction with the negatively charged DNA phosphates. The X-ray crystal structure of the core nucleosome has shown, however, that the histones interact with DNA primarily through hydrogen bonding of amino acid side chains and main chain amide moieties with the DNA phosphates, and nonpolar contacts of side chains with deoxyribose (2). The structure reveals that 6 of 29 arginine residues in the core region and 4 of 22 arginine residues in the tails form salt links to DNA phosphates, and none of the nearly 60 lysine residues in the core and tail regions form such contacts. So, 41 arginine and \u223c40 lysine residues must perform a function unrelated to nucleosome structure or gene regulation through posttranslational modification. What purpose can be served by some 80 positively charged residues?\nWe report here on a role of the great abundance of positive charge in the histone tails. The role is counterintuitive, as we find that the tails do not stabilize the core nucleosome. Rather, they participate in nucleosome disruption, through removal of the histone octamer. This role is fundamental, as it likely gave rise to the evolution of the tails for purposes of functional activity."

            "text": "Histone tails destabilize the nucleosome\nIt was previously shown that the histone octamer dissociates from nucleosomal DNA at concentrations below \u223c10 nM in the presence of 50\u2013150 mM NaCl (6,7). Dissociation is irreversible, because histone octamers further dissociate to H2A\u2013H2B dimers and H3\u2013H4 tetramers. We confirmed this result with the use of nucleosomes assembled with rat liver histones on sea urchin 5S ribosomal DNA, commonly employed as a nucleosome positioning sequence (Figure 1A and B, lanes 16\u201320). Remarkably, following removal of the tails by digestion with trypsin (resulting in an electromobility shift of the nucleosomes, due to the increase in net negative charge, shown in Figure 1A and B, lanes 1\u201310, and documented by SDS-PAGE in Supplementary Figure S1), there was no dissociation at all (Figure 1A and B, lanes 6\u201310). Evidently, the histone tails contribute to instability of the nucleosome at high dilution in 50\u2013150 mM NaCl. By other measures, the nucleosome was unaffected by the removal of the tails. For example, nucleosomes formed with histones possessing or lacking the tails exhibited nearly identical profiles of salt-induced dissociation, with midpoints at \u223c1.13 and \u223c1.05 M NaCl, respectively (8). Similarly, removal of histone tails caused only a slight increase in accessibility of\nDNA near the ends of the nucleosome to digestion by various DNases (9).\nIt was suggested that the instability of the nucleosome at low concentration might play a role in the function of the nucleosome in vivo (6,7). The possibility was raised of kinetic rather than equilibrium control of nucleosome dynamics. We note, however, that the evidence for instability was obtained under nonphysiological conditions. In particular, dissociation was observed in the absence of polyvalent cations, essential for the stability of many protein\u2013nucleic acid complexes. Millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ and of polyamines occur in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (10,11). We found no dissociation of nucleosomes, with or without tails, during prolonged incubation at high dilution in 150 mM NaCl in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+ (Figure 1A and B, lanes 1\u20135 and 11\u201315). Evidently, nucleosomes are stable under physiological conditions, and dissociation must be brought about by the actions of remodelers and other molecules.\nHistone transfer by RSC to a chaperone requires histone tails\nRSC, an abundant, conserved chromatin remodeling complex, transfers histones from nucleosomes to the Nap1 chaperone protein, with the release of naked DNA (12). Under the conditions employed here, the reaction was essentially complete after 30 min. Following trypsin treatment and re-isolation of nucleosomes, the reaction failed to occur (Figure 2A and B). RSC activity was evidently abolished by removal of the histone tails.\nInasmuch as Nap1 interacts with H3 and H4 tails (13), the inhibition of histone transfer upon the removal of tails might reflect a loss of chaperone interaction rather than abrogation of RSC activity. This possibility was investigated by removal of H2A and H2B tails. Nucleosomes were assembled with a set of recombinant yeast histones comprising tailless H2A and H2B and wild-type H3 and\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/8/3671/7034407 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nwithout tails with tails\nnucleosome\nnaked DNA\n5 10 20 30 40 5 10 20 30 40 minutes -2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0 0 5 10 20 30 minutes\nwith tails without tails\n-0.35\n-0.3\n-0.25\n-0.2\n-0.15\n-0.1\n-0.05\n0 0 5 10 20 30 40 minutes\ndel H3 del H4 del H3,4\nA B\nC D\n-0.4 -0.35 -0.3\n-0.25 -0.2\n-0.15 -0.1\n-0.05 0 0\n5 10 20 30 minutes\ndel H2A del H2B del H2A,B del tails\nFigure 2.

(D) Nucleosomes assembled with yeast histones, with tailless H3, tailless H4, or tailless H3 and tailless H4, were treated as in panel (A) and analyzed as in panel (B).\nH4. The rate of histone transfer was diminished by deletion of either the H2A or H2B tail, and to a greater extent by the removal of both H2A and H2B tails (Figure 2C). Similarly, histone transfer was diminished by deletion of either the H3 or H4 tail, and to a greater extent by the removal of both tails (Figure 2D). We conclude that RSC activity requires histone tails, and that the requirement is not limited to any one of them, but rather depends on all.\nAcetylation of histone tails inhibits the transfer of histones by RSC to Nap1 (14), raising the possibility that RSC\u2013tail interaction is involved in histone transfer and is the reason why tailless histones are not transferred. RSC\u2013 nucleosome interaction may be assessed by electromobility shift analysis (15). Dissociation constants may be determined from slopes and intercepts of Scatchard plots. The slopes for nucleosomes with and without tails were within 15% of one another, and the intercepts within a factor of 1.5 of one another, with average Kd values of 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 for nucleosomes with tails and 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22129 for nucleosomes without tails (Supplementary Figure S2A and B). The standard errors in this experiment were much higher than those in others, due perhaps to variation in electrophoretic behavior of the large macromolecular complexes, so the Kd values are only approximate. It nevertheless appears that the affinity of RSC for the nucleosome is high, and little affected by the removal of histone tails.\nHistone octamers are transferred to DNA, and histone tails are required\nThe role of the histone tails in histone octamer transfer is not limited to the activities of chromatin remodeling complexes. We found that nucleosomes dissociate rapidly in the presence of excess naked DNA (Figure 3A and B), whereas tailless nucleosomes are unaffected (Figure 3C and D). Similar results were obtained for chromatin as for isolated nucleosomes (Supplementary Figure S3). The octamer appears to be transferred intact to naked DNA, rather than sequentially as H2A\u2013H2B dimers and H3\u2013H4 tetramer, because no intermediates are observed (the ratio of the octamer nucleosome to a presumptive hexamer nucleosome remains constant throughout the reaction). Loss of histones from tailless nucleosomes only occurred at ionic strengths of 0.4 M and above (Figure 3C and D), at which point histone octamers are known to dissociate even in the absence of additional DNA.\nThe role of individual tails in histone transfer to DNA was investigated with nucleosomes assembled from yeast histones lacking one or more tails. Deletion of any one of the four tails was detrimental to transfer (Figure 3E and F). The effect of deletion was about the same for all tails. Evidently, all tails participate, more or less equally, in the histone transfer process.\nThe dependence of the rate of histone transfer to naked DNA upon DNA concentration was nonlinear and sat-\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/8/3671/7034407 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\n/nar/article/51/8/3671/7034407 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nNucleosomes were treated with acetic anhydride (Ac) or not (wt) and analyzed for histone octamer transfer as in Fig. 3A.

A dissociation constant for the nucleosome:DNA complex (octamer\u2013 nucDNA:DNA*) of \u223c1 M (in DNA base pairs) was determined from a double reciprocal plot (Figure 3H).\nRole of positive charge in histone transfer\nBecause the effect of deletion of the histone tails is incremental, and similar for all tails, there must be a common feature of all the tails that is important for histone transfer. The likely feature is net positive charge. All four histone tails contain \u223c10 lysine and arginine residues, and no acidic residues (except for one aspartic acid in the H2B tail). We tested the role of positive charge by acetylation of lysine residues with acetic anhydride (documented by mass spectrometry; Supplementary Materials), a method commonly employed to neutralize the lysine positive charge. The result was a marked reduction in the rate of histone transfer to DNA (Table 1), comparable to that observed upon removal of the tails from two of the histones (Figure 2). Histone charge evidently plays an important role in histone octamer transfer."

            "text": "Why does a nucleosome bear over 100 positive charges unrelated to the structure of the core particle and unrelated to the role of lysine posttranslational modification in gene regulation? An answer we find relates to the role of the core particle in transcriptional activity. The core particle must be extraordinarily stable to fulfill its role as a general transcription inhibitor, and yet must be capable of rapid dissociation to allow transcription initiation when and where required. The abundance of positive charge in the tails may facilitate dissociation.\nThe positively charged tails may interact with negatively charged nucleosomal DNA to stabilize a partially dissociated state. Histone octamer transfer to naked DNA may be enhanced in this way, but if there were no other effects of\nthe tails, then the rate of transfer would be linearly dependent on the concentration of naked DNA. Rather, the effect is saturable, tending to a limit as the concentration of naked DNA is raised. Transfer evidently proceeds through an intermediate nucleosome:naked DNA complex, which is likely stabilized by interaction of the tails with naked DNA. Similarly, we suggest that histone octamer transfer by RSC to Nap1 occurs through an intermediate nucleosome:Nap1 complex, stabilized by interaction of the positively charged tails with negatively charged Nap1 (pI 4.7). Indeed, an Xray crystal structure of Nap1 has revealed a concentration of negative charge in a region suggested to be involved in histone tail\u2013Nap1 interaction (16).\nThere is precedent for a role of the tails in nucleosome\u2013 DNA interaction (17,18). Both theoretical and experimental studies have indicated a role of the tails in chromatin condensation (19\u201321). For example, native chromatin fibers precipitate at 2 mM MgCl2, whereas tailless fibers do not precipitate at any concentration tested up to 50 mM MgCl2 (22). Fibers containing one or some combination of tails precipitated at intermediate MgCl2 concentrations. It was concluded that the histone tails contributed \u2018additively and independently\u2019 to interfiber interaction. The abundant positive charge of the tails may therefore perform at least two roles, contributing to histone octamer transfer and also to chromosome condensation.\nTheoretical studies have indicated roles of the tails in both stabilization and destabilization of the nucleosome (19,23\u201325), and in particular, destabilization by partial unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA. Partial unwrapping may play a role in chromatin remodeling, inasmuch as remodelers such as SWI/SNF complex and RSC function by translocating DNA across the surface of the nucleosome. Translocation occurs by the formation of a bulge or loop of \u223c10 bp, which passes through the nucleosome in a process referred to as reptation (26). There is experimental evidence for this mechanism (27) and theoretical support for a role of the tails in the process (28\u201330). Removal of histone tails has been shown to impair remodeling by SWI/SNF (31), and the tails may contribute in this manner to histone transfer by RSC, as well as through interaction with the target of transfer, Nap1 or DNA.\nDestabilization of the nucleosome by the histone tails is counterintuitive. It is commonly believed that the nucleosome is stabilized by electrostatic interaction of the positively charged histones with the negatively charged DNA. In humans, the globular region of the histone octamer has a net charge of +58, the tails have a charge of +98 and the DNA has a charge of \u2212294 (32). So, the globular region neutralizes only 20% of the negative charge of DNA in the \u2018core\u2019 nucleosome. The major part of the histone positive charge resides in the tails outside of the core nucleosome. Charge\u2013charge interactions contribute little to the stability of the \u2018core\u2019 nucleosome. Rather, hydrogen binding and nonpolar interactions play a major role, as mentioned above. The extraordinarily high affinity of the histone octamer for DNA is due to the multiplicity of such interactions. The concentration of positive charge in the histone tails plays an altogether different role.\nIt is noteworthy that the histone tails do not contribute significantly to the affinity of RSC\u2013nucleosome interaction.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/8/3671/7034407 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nAlthough RSC contains protein domains for interaction with modified lysine residues in the tails, RSC binds primarily to the core nucleosome. Recent cryogenic electron microscopy studies confirm this interaction (33). Abundant positive charge of lysine and arginine residues in the tails drives chromatin remodeling. This role is general, applicable not only to remodeling by RSC but also to nucleosome disruption by other agents, such as small molecules that bind only to DNA and not to modified or unmodified tail residues (34). This role of the tails is fundamental, as the occurrence of lysine residues in the tails must have preceded their function as targets of posttranslational modification. The tails appear to have evolved in parallel with the core nucleosome, as archaea, which possess only two histones and no tails, form chromatin that can be disrupted by transcription factors with no requirement for remodeling (35\u201337). The acquisition of additional histones to form a much more stable nucleosome created a requirement for remodeling and for the histone tails to assist in the process.\nPosttranslational modifications of lysine residues in the histone tails modulate a wide range of genomic transactions. However, only about a quarter of all positively charged residues in the tails are subject to modification, which begs the question of the role of positive charge in the tails. One role, mentioned above, is for electrostatic interactions to enable chromosome condensation. Our findings demonstrate another important role, the catalysis of chromatin remodeling."
