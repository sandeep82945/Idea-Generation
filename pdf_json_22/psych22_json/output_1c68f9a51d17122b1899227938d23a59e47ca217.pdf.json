I struggle to put my fingers on the keyboard and write this article. I know that it is time to work\u2014but I fight with these emotions. I feel low and lack motivation\u2014but it is time to work. I have trained myself well to fight to \u2018get on with it\u2019 and be the academic I am supposed to be, putting aside the service user identity. The tension between the 2 worlds of being and becoming; a service user and a social work academic\u201d\nI have written previously about occupying 2 worlds as both a social work academic and mental health service user (1, 2). This constant striving to be an effective academic both supports and negates my recovery journey, because my positive identity is strongly linked to my professional success, yet the stress and anxiety undermine my sense as a competent academic (2). However, as a successful academic with a mental health diagnosis, people often deny the complexity of my mental ill-health and its constant interaction with my academic role in the workplace (3). Thus, I explore in this article the identity of being and becoming a social work academic in the context of the lived experience of mental ill-health.\nThe notion of identity is an important element in my constant personal conflict between being and becoming a social work academic whilst still being an expert by experience. Boland (4) in her reflection on becoming a woman poet believes that \u201cbeing\u201d and \u201cbecoming\u201d are positioned in the \u201cwrong order,\u201d because disorder and confusion are, for her, a sustained and central feature of the construction of a poet\u2019s identity. These considerations are also true of the experience of academics, whose identity is in\na state of flux (5). The notion of identity being \u201cliquid\u201d and \u201cunfinished\u201d (6), and forever in a state of becoming underlines this element.\nMy state of being an academic is always couched in terms of becoming as I manage the anxiety derived from teaching and the sometimes uncertainty of paranoia and self-doubt. However, being an academic is framed as reaching the goal of managing mental ill-health, of being recovered rather than on a journey of recovery (7). This stance denies the lived experience identity as I struggle with the complexity of everyday symptoms.\nIdentity work (8: 1165) refers to \u201cpeople being engaged in forming, repairing, maintaining, strengthening, or revising the constructions that are productive of a sense of coherence and distinctiveness.\u201d Thus, I hide the complexity of my identity as a service user to be perceived as a competent and skilled academic. An academic (9) performs many different roles in the working day as one is constantly forming and reforming one\u2019s own self-identity in interaction with the social identity. Identity (10) is thus negotiated with others during relational moments in the social world. I, therefore, manage the interactions of my lived-experience self in the context of my professional identity, working with colleagues, and managers and hiding feelings of uncertainty. Despite this, the distress spills over\u2014but only occasionally\u2014as I manage waves of anxiety and stress which sometimes overwhelm me.\nThere is a complex interaction between upholding the professional identity and managing the identity formed by lived experience. My professional status often requires me to deny and reject the parts of the lived-experience identity when feeling low, stressed, and lacking motivation. It is rejected by others who don\u2019t want to recognize the vulnerability of this identity, because they wish\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /schizophreniabulletin/advance-article/doi/10.1093/schbul/sbac184/6865285 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nPage 2 of 3\nto hear stories of resilience presented as strengths (11). During the process of service user involvement in mental health research (12) or participatory inquiry (13), the lived-experience identity is admired; however, when it negatively affects the professional self, it is denied and rejected by both others and\u2014 also\u2014seemingly by me, as I struggle to hide these complex responses.\nIdentity (14) consists of both past and present encounters and the sense of self can be in conflict. Moreover, self-identity is formed by the way we tell our own stories and build our own narratives of ourselves (15). We author our own story to develop a positive identity that is acceptable to ourselves\u2014yet when we feel threatened, or our self-esteem is low we present a preferred identity (15) to those around us. Therefore, I often deliberately present the preferred identity of strength and resilience\u2014but, despite this, sometimes the cracks in the fa\u00e7ade of competency overwhelm the carefully masked responses resulting in a sense of fear and uncertainty.\nMoreover, every day I transition between the diverse role identities (16) of being an academic, service user, and registered social worker. When boundaries are fluid, I can transition between these roles more freely (17); however, if the role identities are divergent, it can make moving between them more difficult. When lived experience is presented from a strengths position (11) it is easy to move between these identities; yet, when I am feeling vulnerable, moving between these 2 experiences can be both physically and emotionally draining. Others expect that expertise-by-experience can be presented merely at will\u2014 however, it can and does cause distress. Employing rituals when making these boundary changes (18) can help both me and other people to perceive this role change, thus, by forward-planning I can reduce inter-role conflict so that distress can be contained and managed within a teaching, research, or practice setting.\nNonaka (19) highlights the signifiers, which are used to describe her identity as a Japanese professor; these have been depicted as \u201cJapanese,\u201d \u201cfemale,\u201d and \u201cprofessor,\u201d recognizing her cultural, gender, and academic position. My signifiers denote my identity as a woman, parent, partner, service user, and social work academic; although, the \u201cdeficit\u201d identities formed from expertise by experience are often less valued. This is reflected in the notion of intersectionality (20) that can support an understanding of the complexity of managing different deficit identities simultaneously, which results in stigma and marginalization. My identity as both a service user and woman in a nondisabled, patriarchal world simultaneously mark out my deficit attributes, leading me to present a preferred identity to the world as a learned, controlled, and confident academic.\nThe transformative process (21) of undertaking a PhD led to the formation of new identities in lecturers\u2019 construction of self. Similarly, when undertaking my Ph.D., I was able to move from being an expert by experience\nto academic, and this process of change was important in transitioning my identity. However, the legitimacy of my identity as a lived-experience researcher was only accepted once it was supported by academic titles\u2014otherwise, it felt like I was dismissed as being a \u201cpretender\u201d to the role of academic.\nSimilarly, the experience of Turkish students (22) who were sponsored by national schemes to study abroad has been highlighted. Students experienced the double consciousness of both privilege and marginalization as they perceived themselves simultaneously to be both transnational professionals and overseas students. When they returned to Turkey their skills and new identity were not validated, until they achieved tenure. Similarly, expertise-by-experience is acknowledged as less valid; and the inclusion of lived-experience researchers in undertaking different forms of research is often a tokenistic gender, rather than a real partnership (23).\nFinally, I reflect on the relevance of this article to social work education. Reflection is an important part of health and social care practice (24), and informs the way I present my lived experience. Moreover, in UK social work education, there is a requirement by the regulatory body for lived experience to inform all levels of training and practice (25). This obligation underpins an acknowledgment of the legitimacy of lived experience and coproduction to all forms of social work (26). However, where does this place the hybrid identity of being a social work academic and expert by experience?\nLittlechild et al (27). reflect on the use of Johari\u2019s window (28), a 4-stage model in which we move from a place where we are \u201cblind\u201d to our experiences and then become more aware as we relate to each other and share our identities. This model can be used to acknowledge the different identities social workers bring to practice, underlining the legitimacy of experiential knowledge in social work. Despite this commitment in the field of UK social work, the hierarchy of knowledge (29), which identifies the \u201ctruth\u201d of different forms of knowledge, dismisses service user knowledge as the knowledge of least value, therefore, reducing the legitimacy of the lived experience identity, alongside that of the academic identity. Thus, to conclude, this highlights the importance for the international social work profession of supporting the presentation of every element of our identities as academics, including that of lived experience, to allow us to be our authentic selves."
