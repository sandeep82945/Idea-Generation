            "text": "As the experimental program of the LHC searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) is maturing, the community has started devoting significant effort to investigating alternative models and their associated phenomenology, especially those providing exotic signatures which would not have been directly addressed yet in the existing searches. Of interest here is the case of a strongly coupled dark sector or hidden sector, which extends the SM with an additional non-Abelian gauge group. Considering the non-trivial structure of the SM QCD, we should be open to the idea of a potentially com-\nplicated dark sector via non-Abelian gauge groups. These extensions generally contain matter fields, much like the SM quarks and gauge fields similar to the SM gluons. There are no a priory expectations on the gauge group dimension (number of colors), or that of matter fields (number of flavors) that the theory may have.\nWhen the dark sector confines below some confinement scale ( D) dark hadrons are formed, and depending on the symmetries of the theory, some of them could be stable leading to dark matter candidates. To allow for the production of dark states at the LHC, which could be either dark quarks or hadrons, the dark sector is coupled to the SM via a portal. The realisation of associated LHC phenomenology of such dark/hidden sector is however very much dependent on the details of the model. Nevertheless, some generic expectations can be set. For example, at the LHC, cases where dark quark masses (mqD) and corresponding confinement scale are much smaller than the collider centre-of-mass energy (mqD D \u221a s) lead to spectacular signatures in terms of emerging or semi-visible jets [1\u20133]. Increasing D implies heavier bound states, which in turn decreases the final state multiplicities for a given \u221a s, as the allowed phase\nspace decreases. This means that as the limit D \u223c \u221as is approached, depending on the relevant production mechanisms, 2 \u2192 2 SM initial state to dark meson final state processes become prevalent and resonance-like searches for dark bound states may prove useful [4\u20137]. Finally, cases where mqD D,mqD \u221a s lead to unusual signals known as quirks [8\u201310]. If the strongly-interacting sector is non-QCD like, other signatures such as Soft Unclustered Energy Patterns are also possible [9,10]. For a review pertaining to this discussion see [6].\nIn this work, we focus on LHC exploration of such dark/hidden sectors where D \u221as. In such cases, dark quarks could be produced at the LHC through a portal and undergo rapid hadronization within the dark sector before decaying back, at least in part and potentially with sizeable lifetimes, to SM particles. Models with such hidden dark sectors have been discussed e.g. in the context of twin Higgs models [11\u201314], composite and/or asymmetric dark matter scenarios [5,15\u201332], and string theory [33,34]. Some example studies focusing on hidden valley phenomenology can be found in [6,10,35\u201348] with additional examples referred to elsewhere in this write-up. The above references show a rather large activity throughout the last 4 decades.\nThese hidden valley models differ from most other Beyond the Standard Model scenarios because the infrared (IR) parameters of the theory can not be computed from ultraviolet (UV) definitions using perturbative techniques. This is in contrast to many other models e.g. MSSM, which have a well-defined relationships between UV and IR, even if their parameter space is high dimensional. The other well known approach to characterise new physics is the use of simplified\nmodels which do not rely on such top-down priors but are defined by their minimality; these may not be effective for hidden valley scenarios either, due to the inherent dependence on UV parameters in strongly interacting theories. Therefore, neither principles used otherwise to analyse new physics scenarios apply to hidden valley models.\nWhile on the one hand these considerations motivate avenues for model-building with applications to shortcomings of the SM such as e.g. dark matter, LHC searches for hidden valleys are primarily motivated by the exotic phenomenology as stated above. Concretely, this means that we do not have a strong theory prior on e.g. the number of colors and flavors, the mass hierarchies amongst the matter fields, or the possible patterns of flavor breaking. Out of the multiple choices at hand, however, it is nevertheless possible to try and build internally coherent models and develop tools to predict their phenomenology and guide the searches.\nDespite the complexity and the challenges in analysing such non-Abelian new sectors, there has been an increased activity in the recent years that has focused on understanding the signature parameter space of such models, both on the theory and the experimental sides. This report presents some of these developments, particularly concentrating on jet-like signatures, and puts in perspective the efforts necessary to make systematic progress in understanding, classifying and searching for such non-Abelian scenarios. Throughout this report we will consider dark sector scenarios where the dark quarks are uncharged under any SM group and the dark sector communicates to the SM via an additional mediator.\nThe report is organised as follows. QCD-like dark-sector scenarios are first reviewed in Sect. 2, addressing the theories in the s- and t-channels, and the existing benchmarks and limits for such models. Section 3 will address two possibilities of dark sector beyond the QCD-like scenarios: soft unclustered energy patterns (SUEP) and glueballs. Section 4 will be devoted to simulation tool limitations and how to build consistent benchmarks from the underlying physical parameters for semi-visible jets. After a discussion of consistent parameter setting, some improvements to the pythia Hidden Valley module and their validation will be presented, followed by some phenomenological studies on the jet substructure effects of varying the physical parameters. Finally, a series of improved search strategies will be discussed in Sect. 5, based on event-level variables, deep neural networks, autoencoderbased anomaly detection or better triggering algorithms."

            "text": "In SM QCD, the strong coupling constant \u03b1s becomes weaker as the energy increases. This is known as asymptotic freedom. New non-Abelian sectors which display such asymptotic freedom fall into the category of QCD-like scenarios.\nThis section outlines possible exotic signatures that QCDlike dark sector scenarios may exhibit, including a discussion of benchmark models that have been or are currently being employed by the community. We also discuss existing limits in the context of these benchmarks. These signatures and results in turn provide a strong motivation behind detailed studies of such scenarios, motivating further theory effort, as will be discussed in Sect. 4.\n2.1 Theories of dark QCD\nContributors: Timothy Cohen and Christiane Scherb As an organizing principle, we will assume that the dark sector communicates with the Standard Model via a so-called portal. The Standard Model admits three renormalizable portals, in that there are three Standard Model gauge singlet operators with mass dimension less than four: the dark sector can couple to the field strength of the Hypercharge gauge boson B\u03bc\u03bd [49], to the Higgs bi-linear |H |2 [50], or to the neutrino via HL [51]. In this paper, we will focus on introducing a new mediator particle that serves as the portal. This could be a Z\u2032 which would mediate s-channel production [52\u201363], as was proposed in the original hidden valley paper [36], or it could be a new scalar bi-fundamental which would mediate t-channel production [20,21,64\u201367]. In both of these cases, in the limit that the mediator mass is large, it may also be appropriate to integrate it out which would induce a contact operator. There are of course many options beyond these two examples, but to keep our scope finite we will only discuss these s- and t-channel production models.\nDark sector particles can then be produced at hadron colliders via the portal. Similar to SM quarks, dark quarks shower and hadronize and form dark jets. The properties of dark jets are determined by the dynamics of the dark sectors, namely the coupling strength, the ratio of unstable to stable dark hadrons inside the dark jets, and the mass scale of the dark hadrons. Production of dark sector particles at hadron colliders lead to a broad class of exotic signatures: Depending on the lifetime of the dark hadrons final states can contain semi-visible jets, lepton jets, emerging jets, soft bombs, quirks, etc. [1,2,9,63,68\u201375].\nOur focus will be on characterizing exotic signatures that could result at the LHC. The space of possible dark sector models is vast, and furthermore many models can yield essentially the same LHC phenomenology. For this reason, we work with a simplified model-like parameterization of the dark sector. The phenomenology can be largely determined by specifying the dynamics of the dark sector shower (the number of dark colors, dark quark flavors, and the dark confinement scale), the mass spectrum, and decay patters of the dark mesons. We will largely frame the phenomenological implications of having a strongly coupled dark sector in terms of these variables."

            "text": "As discussed above, we take as an organizing principle that the dark sector communicates with the visible sector via a portal. If the portal is heavy, then one can describe it by integrating out the mediator to obtain a so called contact operator [76\u201378], for example\nL \u2283 ci j\u03b1\u03b2 ( qi\u03b3 \u03bcq j ) ( qD\u03b1\u03b3\u03bcqD\u03b2 ) , (1)\nwhere q are SM fermions, qD are dark sector quarks, ci j\u03b1\u03b2 are O(1) couplings encoding a possible flavor structure, and is the scale of the operator. Generally we use Roman indices as SM flavor indices and Greek indices for the dark sector flavor indices.\nWe are assuming that the portal couples the dark sector to the Standard Model quarks. Therefore, the observables of interest will be jets (which are expected to have non-QCDlike features) and missing energy that is likely to be aligned with the jets. One way to organize thinking about the possible signature space is in terms of the average fraction of invisible particles that are contained within a final state jet\nrinv \u2261 \u2329 #stable dark hadrons\n#dark hadrons\n\u232a . (2)\nWe will present results in terms of this variable in what follows.\nOne option for UV completing Eq. 1 is to introduce a so-called s-channel mediator. In such models, pairs of dark quarks can be produced via a heavy resonance Z\u2032, that also couples to SM quarks via [52\u201363]\nL \u2283 \u2212Z \u2032\u03bc ( gqqi\u03b3 \u03bcqi + gqDqD\u03b1\u03b3 \u03bcqD\u03b1 ) , (3)\nwhere gq,qD are the respective coupling constants. In general, Z\u2032 can also couple to other SM particles, which would lead to many possibilities in the final state. For concreteness here, we will focus on dark showers that result in SM jets + missing energy signatures. Therefore, we limit ourselves here to coupling the Z\u2032 to quarks, see Fig. 1. We will also simply give the Z\u2032 a mass, and will not worry about the associated Higgs mechanism or related effects. We will not discuss the additional particle content needed to cancel anomalies, nor the Z \u2212 Z\u2032 mixing structure needed for gqD = gq of models with a heavy Z\u2032 here (c.f. e.g. [79]), but will simply focus on the phenomenology.\nHeavy resonances Z\u2032 are produced at a hadron collider in Drell Yan processes and will have a non-trivial branching ratio to decay to two dark quarks, which shower and hadronize in the dark sector. Then some of the dark sector hadrons are assumed to decay back to Standard Model quarks, which subsequently shower and hadronize as usual.\nConsequently, the phenomenology of s-channel models is governed by the following parameters: the Z\u2032 mass mZ \u2032 , its couplings to visible and dark quarks gq and gqD , the dark sector shower (governed by the number of dark colors, dark flavors, and the scale of dark sector confinement D), the characteristic scale of the dark hadrons mD, and the average fraction of stable hadrons that are aligned with the visible jet rinv. While the coupling to SM quarks determines the Z\u2032 production cross section, the other parameters determine the final state. The details of the shower and mass scale of the dark hadrons determine how many dark sector particles are produced, and rinv determines the amount of missing energy in a dark jet. Depending on these parameters several interesting signatures and search methods can be defined, e.g. semi-visible jets and searches for dark matter in the jet substructure.\nThere are two dominant strategies to search for the signatures of these models, that largely depend on the choice of rinv. When rinv is small, most of the final state associated with the resonance is visible, and so a normal bump hunt strategy can be employed. Then as rinv gets larger, it becomes advantageous to perform a bump hunt using the standard transverse mass variable M2T = M2j j+2( \u221a M2j j + p2T j j ET \u2212 pT j j \u00b7 ET ). Then, once rinv approaches unity, the final state is essentially dominated by missing energy, and so a \u201cmono-jet\u201d style strategy is most sensitive. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 [63], where we show the projected limits on the s-channel model for these different strategies. This approach relies on very simple criteria, and so there is clearly much room for improvements that rely on additional characteristics of these models. Existing limits will be discussed in Sect. 2.3, while strategies for improvements will be addressed in Sect. 5."

Then, the visible and dark sector communicate via a scalar bi-fundamental mediator charged under both the SM and the dark flavor symmetry and qR represent right-handed up-type and down-type quarks. We consider the case where is an SU (2)-singlet, and so it will not have any couplings to the left-handed quark doublets. (We note that generally SU (2)- doublet mediators coupling to left-handed SM quark doublets are also possible.) Depending on the hypercharge of , the dark sector communicates with either the up- (Y = 1/3) or the down-type quarks (Y = \u22122/3). In the following we will always use NcD = N fD = 3. In addition, we assume mqD < D, so that the pseudo-Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons (we will denote them dark pions in the following) of the spontaneously broken dark chiral symmetry are parametrically lighter than other dark hadrons. Consequently, heavier dark sector states, e.g. heavier dark hadrons or glueballs, will decay into dark pions and the dark pions will govern the phenomenology of such models. It is also worth pointing out that for N fD > 3 an unbroken SU (N fD \u2212 3) symmetry leads to one or more stable dark pion [83].\nA particularly interesting feature of such models is the fact that the dark sector inherits the SM flavor structure via \u03ba\u03b1\u03b2i j .\nThe coupling \u03ba\u03b1i can generally be expressed as\n\u03ba = V DU (5)\nwith D a diagonal 3 \u00d7 3 matrix of the form [80]\nD = diag (\u03ba0 + \u03ba1, \u03ba0 + \u03ba2, \u03ba0 \u2212 (\u03ba1 + \u03ba2)) (6)\nand V andU Hermitian 3\u00d73 matrices. FormQ\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2mQ\u03b1\u03b2 the resulting dark flavor symmetryUd(3) can be used to rotate V away. Finally, U can be decomposed into\nU = U23U13U12, (7)\nwith Ui j the rotational matrices for i j . The phenomenology of t-channel dark sectors and dark mesons has been studied e.g. in [1,4,20,21,63\u201367,80\u201387]. At colliders, the particle content of t-channel dark sector models can be produced in various channels such as from mediator pair production (gg/qq \u2192 ) or associated mediator production (gq \u2192 qD), as well as the direct production of dark quarks.\nHere, we will focus on mediator pair production. The diagrams for this process are shown in Fig. 3. Both mediators decay subsequently to a visible and a dark quark, which undergo showering and hadronization, forming a SM and a dark jet. Heavier dark hadrons decay promptly into the lightest dark hadron, the dark pions. Dark pions decay back into SM particles. Depending on the lifetime of the dark pions three different final states are possible:\n\u2022 The dark pions decay promptly and the final states consists of four prompt jets, \u2022 The dark pions have intermediate lifetimes (c\u03c4 \u223c 0.001\u22121 m) and form emerging jets, \u2022 The dark pions are stable on collider scales and are recorded as missing energy.\nWhile in the first and last case the final states consists of typical SM objects, emerging jets provide a very distinct signature: Each pion of a dark jet will decay at a different length due to the boost of each dark pion depending on its individual momentum and the exponential distribution of the actual decay points for a given lifetime. Therefore, from a radial perspective, a dark jet deposits very little energy at the interaction point and then emerges with every dark pion decay into visible particles. The topology of an emerging jet is shown in Fig. 4 in comparison to the displaced dijet signature.\nThe emerging jet signature was first studied in [1] for a dark sector coupling to right-handed down-type quarks and a first search for this signature was performed with CMS [88]. In [87] this search has been combined with recasts of four jet and two jet plus missing energy. (For more details on the recast c.f. Sect. 2.3.5.) It was found that the dark pion mass does not change these bounds in a significant way. The obtained limits can be shown in the usual dark matter massmediator mass frame. To do so assumptions about the ratio of the dark pion and dark matter candidate, here taken as the dark proton (pD), must been made.In Fig. 5 the exclusion limits, combined with the constraints from direct detection experiments are shown as a function of the dark matter mass and the mediator mass formpD = 10m\u03c0D for two different choices of couplings: The left panel corresponds to \u03ba = diag (1, 1, 1),\nright to \u03ba = diag (0.1, 1, 1). This shows clearly how the coupling structure will influence the best search method.\nDue to the connection to the SM flavor structure such models also contribute to flavor processes such as neutral meson mixing and flavor violating Kaon B and D decays. The impact on flavor physics for dark sectors coupled to the down-type quarks has been studied in [80,82,83], and for couplings to up-type quarks in [81,82], as well as models with CP violation [89], and for a simplified model in [86]. In both cases the parameter space is largely unconstrained for dark pion masses above a few GeV. For the case of couplings to the up-type quarks this region could for example be probed via emerging jets from flavor violating top decays (c.f. [90]).\n2.2 Existing benchmarks\nContributors: Elias Bernreuther, Florian Eble, Alison Elliot, Giuliano Gustavino, Simon Knapen, Benedikt Maier, Kevin Pedro, Jessie Shelton, Daniel Stolarski\nSeveral attempts have been done in order to parametrize QCD-like dark sector theories in the literature. These are partly motivated by observations of parametric relationships between the confinement scale and rho and pion masses in the SM, and partly by inferred relationships between e.g. quark masses and meson masses within the pythia 8 HV module. We list below some of the efforts in this context. It is important to note that these do not necessarily imply consistent UV and IR parameters of the underlying non-Abelian dynamics itself, however they have been useful in providing first phenomenological insight in the behaviour of such theories to guide the experiments."

            "text": "Hidden valley models differ from most other models in two crucial aspects. The first is the lack of a very well-defined theory prior on what the model should look like, as already mentioned earlier in this document. The second complication is that, even if we somehow had a strongly preferred model, it would still be very challenging to extract accurate predictions for all observables due to the non-perturbative dynamics in the dark sector.\nBoth these challenges indicate that we may be best served by a suite of searches that is as model-independent as possible. This is easier said than done however, and some theory priors are always needed to design an experimental analysis, especially in the initial phases of this program. Reference [95] has advocated to inject these theory priors in the decay portals that allow the dark sector to decay back to the Standard Model. This approach has the following advantages:\n1. The number of plausible options is relatively limited once one restricts to the set of decay portals that do not introduce dangerous flavor-changing neutral currents. A systematic survey is therefore very feasible. 2. We have good theoretical control over these decay portals, in terms of both the dark particle\u2019s decay length and its allowed branching ratios. This is in contrast to the process of dark sector hadronization, where we must resort to parameterizing our ignorance as best we can. 3. If one moreover insists on a relatively minimal UV completion and/or no more than moderate fine tuning, one can moreover derive an approximate lower bound on the lifetime of the dark mesons. This gives the models a little bit more predictive power. The resulting lifetimes and branching ratios of the visibly-decaying dark particle are crucial for the design of experimental search strategies and a systematic survey of models featuring a minimal suite of decay portals can therefore be a good starting point for a comprehensive experimental search program.\nThe portals considered in Ref. [95] are summarized in Table 1. To maintain compatibility with the pythia Hidden Valley module at the time, a simplified dark sector was con-\nsidered with a single (pseudo)scalar \u03b7D and vector \u03c9D meson. For the dark photon portal an additional elementary dark photon A\u2032 was added. For each of these portals the branching ratios and lower bound on the lifetime of the visibly decaying particle were computed (see Fig. 8).\nFor the gluon portal one assumes that the dark sector pseudoscalar meson (\u03b7D) decays through a dimension 5 coupling to the Standard Model gluons, leading to very hadronrich final states. This coupling requires a low-scale UV completion, especially because \u03b7D itself is a composite state and the \u03b7DGG\u0303 coupling should be suppressed by dimensional transmutation in models with perturbative parton showers. Such a UV completion moreover requires the presence of new, colored particles, which could be produced at the LHC. The bound in Fig. 8 was obtained by assuming that any such states must have a mass 2 TeV. This assumption can be relaxed by devising an elaborate extension of the model to hide the new colored particles from existing searches at ATLAS and CMS.\nThe photon portal works in the same way as the gluon portal, except that the \u03b7D couples to the Standard Model photons instead of the gluons. This portal leads to very photonrich final states. Its lifetime bound is informed by collider\nconstraints on new charged particles, which are required in the UV completion of this portal.\nThe vector portal assumes that the Standard Model photon mixes with the dark vector meson \u03c9D, similar to the photon-\u03c1 mixing in the Standard Model. In this portal it was assumed that the \u03b7D was absolutely stable, leading to a semivisible jet phenomenology. The UV completion of this portal requires the introduction of an additional, elementary Z\u2032 vector field. The lifetime bound in Fig. 8 was informed by the bounds on the mass and coupling of the Z\u2032 from direct searches and electroweak precision observables.\nIn the Higgs portal scenario, the \u03b7D decays by mixing with the Standard Model Higgs, leading to a heavy flavorrich phenomenology. In this scenario, no new particles are needed in the UV completion. The H\u2020H operator does however contribute directly to the masses of the constituents of the \u03b7D mesons, which leads to the lower bound in Fig. 8. This bound can be evaded by fine-tuning the masses of the constituents of the \u03b7D.\nFinally, the dark photon portal is inspired by the Standard Model \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay, as it assumes a light, elementary vector field (A\u2032) which couples to the \u03b7D through a chiral anomaly. The A\u2032 itself can then mix with the Standard Model photon, resulting fairly lepton-rich final states. With this portal, the lifetime constraint is very mild and comes exclusively from direct searches for the A\u2032 itself.\nAll assumptions and branching ratios are encoded in the public python script https://gitlab.com/simonknapen/dark_ showers_tool which can generate pythia configuration cards for all five decay portals.\n2.3 Existing constraints\nContributors: Giuliano Gustavino, Steven Lowette, Kevin Pedro, Pedro Schwaller, Andrii Usachov, Carlos V\u00e1zquez Sierra\nThe discussion so far has not only established that QCDlike dark sectors are theoretically interesting, but that they can also lead to exotic signatures for the experiments. In light of this observation, several searches at the LHC have already been carried out, with many other studies also underway. The search results are currently reported using one or more of the benchmarks discussed in Sect. 2.2. In this section, we illustrate some of the public search results, and existing constraints on the theory landscape. Given that the searches rely on generic signal characteristics, it may be possible to reinterpret the results in terms of other, UV/IR coherent models."

Per-jet quantities indicating displaced tracks \u2013 including the 2D impact parameter, the 3D impact parameter significance, and the fraction of the pT from prompt tracks associated with the primary vertex \u2013 are used to identify or \u201ctag\u201d jets as emerging.

The latter option increases sensitivity to models with larger c\u03c4\u03c0D values where many dark hadrons decay outside of the detector. The misidentification rate for this tagging procedure is measured and used to estimate the QCD multijet background. Heavy flavor jets from B hadrons are found to be misidentified more frequently, as expected because of their non-negligible decay lengths. Multiple signal regions with different selection requirements are defined, and for each model, the signal region with the highest expected sensitivity is used.\nThe search results are shown in Fig. 9.

With sufficient displacement, jets can arise in which none of the tracks of the constituent charged hadrons can be reconstructed, thus making the jets appear neutral. Such neutral jets are extremely rare among high-momentum jets from regular standard-model quarks or gluons, and can thus be a very sensitive probe of physics beyond the standard model from dark sectors.\nThe CMS collaboration has performed a search for a pair of such trackless jets [98] using 16.1 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity recorded in 2016. The signature probed consisted of a pair of back-to-back high-momentum trackless jets, where experimentally the trackless nature was sought by looking for the ratio of the jet energy carried by charged particles to the energy carried by neutral particles to be less than 5%. To illustrate the effectiveness of this requirement in suppressing standard model QCD background jets, a background rejection of over 105 in data was reported for this 5% requirement.\nThis CMS search for trackless jets was inspired by and interpreted in a model proposing a new interaction through a low-mass mediator with a new dark matter fermion [3]. The interaction leads to very high interaction cross sections, which are not necessarily excluded, though many model assumptions need to be made to avoid the many cosmology, particle physics and astrophysical constraints. The model considered is not a dark sector model per se, as indeed there is no decay back from a dark sector leading to missing charged hadrons, but rather the jets constitute solely of SIMP particles interacting in the calorimeters, thus generating neutral jets. The aspect of a displaced decay is thus missing, though the similar experimental signature does potentially impact dark sector searches.\nThe interpretation of the CMS trackless jets search in the SIMPs model has been found to be difficult at large SIMP masses, above \u223c100 GeV. At such high masses, the modeling of the SIMP-nucleon interaction is complicated by the SIMP mass, and the approximation used in the CMS analysis, which involved treating the SIMP in the Geant simulation as a massive neutron-like object, becomes exploratory. As such, the strong exclusion limits on the SIMP pair production cross section as a function of the SIMP mass, obtained by CMS in absence of an excess of trackless jets in the analyzes data, shown in Fig. 11, are reported with this caveat above 100 GeV."

While dark showers are a spectacular and unique signature, existing new physics searches still retain some sensitivity in regions of parameter space where the signal looks SM-like.\nFor t-channel dark sectors [1,21,83], often the leading production mode is pair production of the heavy mediator, which gives rise to a signature with two ordinary QCD jets and two dark showers, as shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that missing energy searches should become efficient in the limit where the dark sector particles become very long lived, while searches for prompt multijet signals can probe the regime of very short lifetimes. Due to the stochastic nature of particle decays, these searches also retain some sensitivity in the intermediate lifetime regime.\nA recast of a di-jet plus MET search [99], a search for paired prompt di-jet resonances [100] and of the dedicated\nemerging jets search [88] was performed in Ref. [87]. As can be seen in Fig. 12, the dedicated emerging jets search performs best in the intermediate lifetime regime, while the recast searches can probe all the remaining range of lifetimes. As expected, mediator masses below the TeV scale are already strongly constrained. In the short lifetime regime, the constraints are weaker. This is partially because the published search uses only a limited amount of data, but also because fighting the QCD multi-jet background is hard. Another option to constrain the t-channel mediators in the regime of short dark sector lifetimes is through their contribution to angular correlations in dijet events [101], when the mediator is exchanged in the t-channel instead. This constraint however will depend on the magnitude of the Yukawa coupling of the mediator.\nThe t-channel mediators naturally allow couplings that break SM flavor symmetries. While most flavor violating couplings are constrained by low-energy flavor observables [83,86], the LHC has the potential to constrain flavor changing couplings of the top quark [90]. Such scenarios could also be of interest for searches for dark showers produced in association with tops or even stemming from exotic top decays."

An excellent secondary vertex resolution, low momentum thresholds and particle identification capabilities make LHCb a natural candidate to search for dark QCD signatures in the low-mass region. These searches are now becoming part of the LHCb physics program, where world-leading constraints have already been set for hidden valley scenarios, with reinterpretations in other dark sector models as well as a large number of very encouraging sensitivity projections, described in the following paragraphs.\nLHCb has published a search for low-mass resonances decaying into pairs of muons, using 5.1 fb\u22121 of data collected at 13 TeV [102]. In this article, a model-independent search of both prompt and displaced resonances X is performed. For the displaced case, the secondary X \u2192 \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212 decay vertex is required to be transversely displaced from the primary vertex in the range 12 < \u03c1T < 30 mm, allowing for the resonance to become a long-lived signature in the detector. Then, limits on the cross-section \u03c3(X \u2192 \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212) are placed, and interpreted in various production models. One of these models in the regard of dark QCD is that of a hidden valley scenario, where constraints are set on the kinetic mixing strength \u03b3 \u2212 ZHV between a heavy hidden valley boson ZHV with photon-like couplings, and a photon, fixing the average multiplicity of hidden valley hadrons to a value of 10. These are the most stringent constraints placed up to date, for masses of a composite hidden valley vector boson, X , up to 3 GeV, as presented in Fig. 13.\nThese results have been also re-interpreted in the context of Z-initiated dark showers, assuming various benchmark scenarios [103]. In Fig. 14, projections for one of the scenarios are shown, showing the capabilities of LHCb to probe Z branching fractions down to 10\u22127 during the high-luminosity phase.\nIn a more general sense, the capabilities of LHCb to probe other dark QCD models are summarized in Ref. [104], in the context of benchmark scenarios featuring a range of dark hadron and mediator masses, for different assumptions on the average dark hadron multiplicity in the dark sector. The projections described in this major report show the outstanding potential of the LHCb experiment to place very stringent\nconstraints in the low-mass range, in complementarity with ATLAS and CMS."

            "text": "Although the production of quarks in a QCD-like confining theory leads inevitably to jets of hadrons, the details are not always the same. The width of the jets, the hadron multiplicity per jet, and the jet multiplicity all depend on the value of the running coupling. More specifically, jets arise from the partonic shower, which depends on the running \u2019t Hooft coupling \u03bb \u2261 \u03b1DNcD (\u03b1s Nc in QCD), evaluated at and somewhat below the energy scale at which the jets are produced.\nIn QCD-like theories, like in QCD, jets at lower energy, closer to the confinement scale and thus at larger \u03bb, are broader, because gluon radiation at larger angles is more common with the large coupling. One might then imagine that if \u03bb could somehow be taken large without reducing the energy of the collisions, then the jets produced might become so broad and numerous as to blur together, creating a smooth distribution and a non-jetty final state. In QCD-like theories this question is almost academic, since \u03bb only becomes large near the confinement scale. In e+e\u2212 collisions near the confinement scale, only a small handful of hadrons are produced, making it hard to define jets in the first place. Jets were only identified in e+e\u2212 collisions at scales \u223c 10 GeV, where \u03bb < 1, and gluon jets only at 27 GeV.\nHowever, in 1998 it was shown [105] that certain classes of supersymmetric conformal field theories (roughly speaking, these are theories with whose beta functions are all zero and are thus scale-invariant) are equivalent to string theories on certain curved spaces. These theories can have arbitrary values of \u03b1D (now constant) and NcD . The duality can be used to compute many of properties of these theories when\nFig. 13 Upper bounds at 90% CL on the kinetic mixing strength \u03b3 \u2212 ZHV . The grey box shows a vetoed region due to the large doubly misidentified K 0S background. Figure taken from Ref. [102]\nFig. 14 Projections at 90% CL of LHCb sensitivity to a muon rich dark showers initiated by the decay of a Z into dark quarks (here called \u03c8 \u2032). In this benchmark scenario, a dark pion mass (here called \u03c0\u0302 ) of 650 MeV, an average multiplicity of 7 and a branching fraction of the dark pion into two muons of 96%, are assumed. More details can be found in Ref. [103]\n\u03b1DNcD 1 \u03b1D. It was noted in [106] that rapid pdf evolution in this regime leads to an absence of hard partons inside hadrons. Since similar dynamics controls jet evolution, this naturally suggests that jets will be absent in this regime as well. Several groups [107\u2013109] argued that there should be no jets in this limit, and it was proven convincingly in [109] that the correlation function of energy operators indicates that a partonic shower in this regime, allowed to proceed over a wide range of energies, will approach a spherically symmetric distribution on average. The distribution of momenta of these partons is not determined, however.\nNote, importantly, that a spherically symmetric shower is not a consequence of conformal symmetry. A conformally invariant theory at small \u03bb will exhibit jets much like QCD itself; indeed, QCD at high energy is nearly conformally invariant, with scaling violated only by small logs (a fact which played an important role in the discovery of quarks.) Only at when \u03bb 1 \u03b1D are roughly spherical showers expected, and corrections to the spherical shape are of order 1/ \u221a \u03bb. Thus, for events that typically differ from spherical by < 10%, one probably must have NcD 100. A conformally-invariant hidden sector is generally observable only as ET (except for small rare processes discussed in the unparticle literature) as the energy will be shared down to massless partons. Interesting hidden valley signatures arise\nonly if the conformal invariance is broken at some scale Qc much lower than the production scale M . The shower that follows production of hidden partons is converted at Qc to a large number of hidden particles of small mass mD Qc. If some of these are able to decay to the SM, then this can lead to a signature of many particles which are roughly spherically distributed in some frame of reference, not necessarily the lab frame [9,107]. This signature is defined as a Soft Uncorrelated Energy Pattern, or SUEP.\nWe note that there have been disputes in the theoretical literature concerning whether the SUEP arising in this context is related directly to cascades of 5d KK states, with different points of view taken by [68,110] versus [107,111]. From the phenomenological point of view this may not matter very much in the near term, but the issue could arise if in future KK-cascade-based generators are created and assumed (perhaps incorrectly) to describe the same phenomenon as SUEP.\nIf the conformal symmetry breaking involves the complete Higgsing of a gauge group, it is clear that a near-spherical shower leads to a near-spherical SUEP. If the conformal symmetry breaking involves confinement, this is less clear and has not been proven; it may be that it is somewhat modeldependent. We will nevertheless assume it is the case, and that SUEPs can arise from the SM decay products of dark hadrons produced from a spherical shower of dark gluons.\nWe will further assume that those dark hadrons can resemble those from a QCD-like spectrum, with low-lying spin-0 and spin-1 mesons and with limited roles for heavier mesons. Baryons should have mass of order NcD 1 and will play no role.\nSince techniques to calculate SUEPs, even in the few models where they are known to occur, do not yet exist, the simulations [9,112] to study them are necessarily somewhat ad hoc. The assumption is made that particles are produced spherically according to a thermal distribution with an unknown temperature TD of order Qc, the conformal breaking scale; see Sect. 3.1.2. (Note mD, the typical hadron mass, may be of order Qc or may be much smaller, especially for pion-like states; in the latter case, multiplicities may be surprisingly low.) The value of TD/Qc should be varied and treated as a quantifiable uncertainty.\nLess clear is how to treat the uncertainties of the thermal approximation in the first place. A thermal model for hadronization in QCD works moderately well; perhaps this reflects the tendency for complex statistical systems to approach thermal ones. However, there is no proof that it would work for all or even most confining theories. One way to approach the uncertainty might be to vary the thermal spectrum in one or another way, using insights from studies of how systems equilibrate.\nFinally, an uncertainty arises from the fact that in realistic theories the spherical approximation will suffer corrections, and at the current time those corrections have not been characterized theoretically nor incorporated into the simulation tools. Some effort to quantify this uncertainty ought to be undertaken.\nSince SUEPs and the simulation packages used to simulate them represent a certain idealized situation, real signatures may differ from this idealized model. In this regard, the following should probably be kept in mind:\n\u2022 Only a small number of theories of this class have been proven to exist, all of them supersymmetric and with N fD NcD, where N fD is the number of quarks in the fundamental representation. \u2022 The statement that expected distributions are spherical receives substantial corrections, of order 1/ \u221a \u03bb at the\nconfinement scale. For an observably spherical SUEP, one may need NcD \u223c 100. Because the particles of the hidden sector can appear in loops, coupling a mediator to a theory with NcD \u223c 100 or more can have large consequences for the mediator or even the Standard Model sector; care must be taken in defining a consistent model. \u2022 Event-to-event fluctuations can lead to large deviations from the SUEP idealization. When the multiplicity of visibly-decaying hadrons is low, Poisson fluctuations are large. For instance, if sixty dark hadrons are produced near-spherically but only ten decay visibly, the observed\nevent will be far from spherical and potentially very asymmetric."

            "text": "In order to search for these novel signatures at high energy colliders, it is essential to generate events that capture the phenomenological characteristics of the energy pattern. Perturbation theory breaks down in the large coupling regime, and standard approaches to event simulation are unreliable. Novel methods are necessary to generate SUEP events.\nSeveral simulation methods that can generate quasispherical energy patterns exist, such as black hole generators [113\u2013115] or simplified 5d models [111]. However, these tools are not ideal for developing new analyses or triggering strategies. LHC experiments already have extensive search programs for black holes [116\u2013120]. The latter tool does not have an obvious portal to connect to the SM. We will therefore discuss the utility of another tool in this section: the SUEP generator [112].\nThe simplified model used by this generator is described in Ref. [9]. In this framework, a hidden valley (HV) of new physics with confining dynamics is accessed via a heavy scalar mediator. A wide class of mediators can be used to connect the SM and HV, but a scalar portal from gluon fusion was chosen to both explore a triggering \u2018nightmare scenario\u2019 as well as study a potential rare Higgs decay mode. The scalar then decays into a high multiplicity of light HV mesons of a single flavor, of mass mD, that follow a Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution\ndN d3p \u223c exp\n( \u2212 \u221a p2 + m2D/TD ) . (10)\nAn illustration of this process is shown in Fig. 15. The user is free to select the temperature, TD, and mD, but for reasonable results the two parameters should satisfy TD/mD > 1 such that the final state is high multiplicity. Note that in a confining theory like QCD, the mass of the lightest meson can be much less than the confinement scale D \u223c TD, so TD mD is a motivated and physical choice. For a fixed scalar and meson mass, a higher temperature will correspond to fewer particles with a more significant boost. The tool is only intended to work in the high multiplicity limit, which means that the user must set mS TD,mD for consistent results. A numerically small amount of momentum conservation violation may be observed in some events.\nAfter production and showering, the dark mesons must decay back to SM for a visible signal. In this benchmark model, it is assumed that the dark mesons couple to a new U(1) gauge boson A\u2032\u03b3 that kinetically mixes with SM hypercharge. The dark mesons decay into a A\u2032\u03b3 A\u2032\u03b3 pair. Each A\u2032\u03b3 then decays into SM particles, for example dilepton (e+e\u2212\nand \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212) or hadronized final states. The A\u2032\u03b3 mass and branching ratio to Standard Model particles is configurable by the user.\nThis tool has the potential to inform and test diverse future analysis techniques. The phenomenology of the model depends on the choices of scalar mediator mass mS , the dark meson mass mD and temperature TD, as well as the decay branching ratios of the new particles. Depending on the signal of interest, the user can configure these values to achieve different multiplicity or species final states. Simple extensions of the package could include different possible mediators and decay portals."

            "text": "The classification of \u2018SUEP\u2019 is on the final state signature rather than a specific type of model. A SUEP (previously called \u2019soft bomb\u2019 [9]) is usually an event with a high multiplicity of soft particles distributed quasi-isotropically in their rest frame. The underlying physics that produces such events can be varied. As discussed earlier, if the new particles interact strongly over a wide energy window, the shower develops by soft and isotropic emissions [36,106,109]. However, SUEPs can also develop from kinematics due to phase space arguments. If a new physics model includes many unstable particles with small mass splittings [110,111], subsequent decays are unboosted and can approximate a spherical energy distribution for sufficiently large particle multiplicity. A common example of such event is R-parity violating SUSY [121,122].\nSince many different new physics scenarios can produce a SUEP signature, it is compelling to generically search for such events at colliders. As their common underlying feature is their global radiation pattern, event shape observables can serve as useful analysis tools. By studying the global\nevent shape, it is both possible to quantify new physics and distinguish signal from background.\nEvent shape observables have been used to study QCD and measure \u03b1s [123\u2013137]. There have been several observables developed to quantify the degree to which a collider event is isotropic versus jet-like, including thrust [123,138,139], sphericity [140,141], spherocity [142], and the C- and Dparameters [143\u2013145]. While these observables have provided indispensable insights to QCD, they are most sensitive to deviations from dijet events rather than a robust probe of isotropy. To capture the phenomenology of a SUEP event it is necessary to define new observables which probe the opposite regime.\nA new observable called event isotropy aims to study deviations from truly isotropic events [146]. This observable is defined using the Energy Mover\u2019s Distance (EMD) [147,148], the particle physics application of the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance [149\u2013153]. Event isotropy quantifies how \u2018far\u2019 an event is from isotropic, with smaller values indicating an event is more isotropic. Figure 16 shows event isotropy for SUEP benchmark models with different mediator masses and temperatures.\nFigure 17 shows results from a related study that demonstrates how event isotropy is not strongly correlated with final state multiplicity, or reconstructed number of jets. Additionally, it correlates with canonical event shape observables much less than they correlate with each other in the quasiisotropic regime. While there can be correlation with traditional event shapes, both types of observables can be used to better characterize the underlying physics."

            "text": "The diffuse low momentum nature of SUEP events strongly resembles soft-QCD backgrounds at the LHC. Without high momentum final state particles, SUEP events with allhadronic final states can easily be mistaken for pile-up collisions, and pose extreme challenges for general purpose detectors such as ATLAS and CMS.\nThe first and most challenging step for any SUEP analysis is to identify a trigger strategy. The trigger systems of ATLAS and CMS operate in a two-step process to determine which events are saved for analysis. The first stage, Level 1, makes a fast decision incorporating coarse calorimeter and muon information. The second stage, the High Level Trigger (HLT), makes use of refined calorimeter and muon information and adds limited tracking. SUEP events typically have low efficiency for traditional triggers, which are designed to reject pile-up. However, there remain several possible analysis strategies utilizing data already collected during Run 2 of the LHC.\nIn order to characterize the difficulty of observing lower mass mediators, several benchmarks points are used: medi-\nin quasi-isotropic radiation patterns. For reference, we also include the correlation plot of the same samples in thrust and maximum eigenvalue (bottom right). The contours enclose 99% of the events for all of the samples. Figures adapted from [154]\nator masses of 1000 GeV, 750 GeV, 400 GeV, and 125 GeV. Here, the choice of the 125 GeV benchmark is motivated by the observed Higgs boson, which may itself serve as a portal to the hidden sector. The mediator is assumed to be produced via gluon fusion (GF). For the Higgs portal benchmark, associated production (ZH) also considered, where the Z boson decays leptonically. All signals are produced assuming dark mesons have a mass of 2 GeV, and the system has a temperature of 2 GeV. These dark mesons subsequently decay into a pair of dark photons. Multiple dark photon decays are explored for GF production using dark photon branching ratios; BR(A\u2032\u03b3 \u2192 uu) = 100%, with m(A\u2032\u03b3 ) = 1 GeV, BR(A\u2032\u03b3 \u2192 ee, \u03bc\u03bc, \u03c0\u03c0) = (40, 40, 20)% with m(A\u2032\u03b3 ) = 0.5 GeV labelled as leptonic, and BR(A\u2032\u03b3 \u2192 ee, \u03bc\u03bc, \u03c0\u03c0) = (15, 15, 70)% with m(A\u2032\u03b3 ) = 0.7 GeV labelled as hadronic.\nTrigger strategies based on the scalar sum of hadronic activity (HT ) in the event can be used to target mediators produced via GF. In order to prevent extremely high background rates from QCD, ATLAS and CMS typically required HT > 500 GeV at Level 1, and HT > 1 TeV at HLT throughout Run 2. The vast majority of signal events which pass these requirements involve a mediator recoiling against an initial state radiation jet with high pT . Trigger efficiency significantly decreases as the mediator mass decreases and the total energy deposition decreases. Figure 18 shows the HT distribution as well as the number of tracks for different SUEP mediator masses.\npending on the production mechanism and branching fraction of the dark photon, SUEP events may contain multiple final state muons. In these cases, muon triggers designed\nto target vector boson or b-physics processes can provide much higher trigger efficiency than HT triggers, especially for lower mass mediators. Figure 19 shows the number of muons and the leading muon pT for several Higgs portal SUEP scenarios. Signals with larger leptonic branching ratios result in large multiplicities of moderate momentum muons, and can be targeted with tri-muon triggers. Leptons produced via associated production can be targeted with single and double-muon triggers.\nThe upcoming Run 3 at the LHC offers an opportunity to design new triggers that specifically target SUEP signatures. One possibility is to use a standard HT or multi-jet trigger at Level 1, with a large multiplicity of tracks in the High Level Trigger. SUEP events are likely to be boosted after passing the Level 1 trigger, with SUEP decay products recoiling against Standard Model jets from initial state radiation. Figure 20 shows how events become less isotropic with increasing \u2211 pT requirements. As a result, using event shape observables would be suboptimal at HLT. In contrast, it is possible to choose an HLT track multiplicity requirement that is highly efficient for SUEP events, and also reduces backgrounds such that the HT requirement can be kept as low as Level 1 thresholds.\nA trigger which requires HT > 500 GeV and at least 150 tracks per event would yield a QCD efficiency one order of magnitude smaller than the currently employed HT > 1050 GeV trigger, while recovering nearly all the SUEP events that already pass the HT > 500 GeV selection. Note that this study assumes tracks can be reconstructed with nearly full eff\niciency and associated to the primary vertex.\nIf track reconstruction is too computationally expensive to run in the High Level trigger or has sub-optimal performance, it is possible to design a trigger which counts the number of hits in the innermost layers of the ATLAS and CMS tracking detectors. This approach was studied in Ref. [9]. In addition to being less computationally expensive, hit counting is sensitive to even the softest particles in SUEP events. Charged particles with pT > O(10) MeV can reach the innermost layer of the tracker and produce a hit. One trade-off is that hits cannot be associated to a primary vertex, and pile-up collisions increase the number of hits per event for background.\nHits from SUEP events are likely to be localized in z near the primary vertex, and this can be used to discriminate against pile-up.\nThere are also several potential strategies to trigger on SUEP events directly at Level 1. When SUEP events are not boosted, final state particles create a band which spans all \u03c6 and are centered around a definite value of \u03b7. It may be possible to reduce thresholds by designing a trigger which looks for high HT in one \u03b7-slice compared to the rest of the event.\nAdditional Level 1 strategies depend on the final state particles in the SUEP event. An all-electron or all-photon signal would create an abnormally high ratio of energy deposited in the Electromagnetic Calorimeter compared to the Hadronic Calorimeter. This method could be further refined by requiring Electromagnetic energy be centered around a single \u03b7slice. Alternatively, SUEP events with dark matter particles in the final state, semi-visible SUEP could potentially be accessed via a missing-transverse-momentum trigger.\nBoth ATLAS and CMS will upgrade their detectors and trigger schemes at the High Luminosity LHC, offering further opportunities to design new SUEP triggers. The projected CMS trigger at the HL-LHC will reconstruct charged particles with pT > 2 GeV at Level 1. This new scheme would enable even more optimization of the trigger design at the L1 level. One could optimize a selection on the number of tracks at L1 to recover an even greater quantity of low HT events. This strategy would be most effective for higher temperature scenarios.\nOnce a trigger strategy has been determined, it is essential to reconstruct the low-momentum charged particles associated with SUEP signatures. Standard ATLAS and CMS\ntrack reconstruction is highly efficient for charged particles which traverse roughly 8 layers of the silicon trackers [155,156]. In CMS reconstruction is roughly 90% efficient for charged particles with pT \u2265 1 GeV, and roughly 60% efficient for particles with pT \u223c 300 MeV. In ATLAS, nominal track reconstruction has a minimum requirement of pT \u2265 500 MeV. Standard reconstructed tracks typically have impact parameter resolutions on the order of 100 \u00b5m [157], which enables tracks to be associated to the primary vertex (proton-proton collision of interest). This primary vertex requirement ensures that the computed track multiplicity is not biased by nearby pile-up collisions.\nThere are additional possibilities to reconstruct charged particles with even lower momenta. In ATLAS, tracks with pT > 100 MeV can be reconstructed for a small subset of events [158]. These events would be processed with an additional pass of tracking, using leftover hits, in a region of interest of z \u223c 1 mm around the primary vertex. To access even lower momentum charged particles, pT \u223c 10 MeV, it is possible to count the number of hits in the inner most layers of the detector. While this strategy would increase the acceptance for extremely low-momentum SUEP particles, it is impossible to associate hits to a particular primary vertex. This strategy also requires accessing low level data which may not be possible due to storage constraints.\nFor SUEP signatures with higher temperatures, a significant number of final state Standard Model particles will have moderate momenta, pT > 3 GeV. For these scenarios, it is possible to identify final state particles as muons, electrons, or hadrons. Events with a large multiplicity of low momentum leptons would be a particularly striking signal, and this information could be used to further improve signal to background discrimination.\nAfter reconstruction, the unique properties of SUEP events can then be used to separate against signal from QCD background. The two most powerful observables include the characteristic high track multiplicity, and the isotropic distribution of such tracks.\nFor analyses using data that were collected during Run 2, trigger strategies will likely rely on the presence of additional objects produced in association with the SUEP shower, either based on a high quantity of ISR QCD or a massive gauge boson decaying to triggering objects. In both cases, a simple procedure to recover the SUEP shower can be followed. First, the triggering object can be identified with standard reconstruction techniques and subtracted from the overall event representation. Second, the remaining tracks can be boosted against the triggering object. In case the later is produced back-to-back with the mediator, these would allow to recover both the track multiplicity and spherically symmetrical distribution of the SUEP shower.\nRecently, the anomaly detection techniques as a generic way to search for new physics have been incorporated to\nSUEP searches. A proposal based on autoencoders [159] shows the strength of such techniques for low mediator masses and temperatures. Additional details on this approach are presented in Sect. 5.4.\n3.2 Glueballs\nContributors: David Curtin, Caleb Gemmell, Christopher B. Verhaaren\nIn the N fD = 0 limit for SU (NcD) Yang\u2013Mills theories, the only hadronic states that form below the confinement scale are glueballs, composite gluon states. This limit is unique because there are no light degrees of freedom below the confinement scale. In the absence of such light states color flux tubes cannot break via the creation of quark-antiquark pairs. This process is essential to present QCD hadronization models [160,161], thus the usual understanding of hadronization does not directly apply to the N fD = 0 limit. This qualitative difference has hindered efforts to study dark glueball showers in scenarios with pure Yang\u2013Mills dynamics.\nSectors with N fD = 0 SU (NcD) Yang\u2013Mills descriptions commonly appear in neutral naturalness theories, such as Twin Higgs models [11,12], Folded Supersymmetry [162] and many others [163\u2013166]. The glueballs of a hidden confining sector have also been considered as dark matter candidates [23,26,167,168]. Thus, N fD = 0 SU (NcD) Yang\u2013 Mills models are motivated by possible solutions to the Little Hierarchy problem and the unknown nature of dark matter. Current ignorance of the pure-glue hadronization process has left these models in an largely unstudied corner of motivated parameter space. The hadronization process determines the final state multiplicity and energy distribution of dark glueballs, which are essential for both collider and indirect detection studies.\nThe properties of the glueballs themselves are relatively well-known, having been studied in lattice gauge theory [169\u2013173]. In the absence of external couplings, these studies have established a spectrum of 12 stable glueball states characterized by their J PC quantum numbers. When considered as part of a dark sector, these glueballs can be stable or decay through a variety of portals to the SM [43,45], with possibly long lifetimes on collider or cosmological time scales. This spectrum can entirely be parameterised by the confinement scale of the theory, or equivalently lightest glueball mass, m0 \u223c 6 D. These glueball properties are also known for several NcD = 3 which paves the way for studying exotic dark sectors outside the standard dark SU (3) case [23,167,174,175].\nRecently, efforts have been made to enable quantitative studies of pure Yang\u2013Mills parton showers and hadronization [75]. This includes the creation of a new public python\npackage, GlueShower.2 This package allows users to simulate dark glueball showers produced from an initial pair of dark gluons. GlueShower combines a perturbative pureglue parton shower with a self-consistent and physically motivated parameterization of our ignorance regarding the unknown glueball hadronization behaviour. Two qualitatively different hadronization possibilities are included: a more physically motivated jet-like assumption, and a more exotic plasma-like option that accounts for the possibility that color-singlet gluon-plasma-states are created by hypothetical non-perturbative effects far above the confinement scale. Each such plasma-ball then decays isotropically to glueballs in its restframe, somewhat akin to dark hadron production in SUEP scenarios [9,107,159]. Within each hadronization option, two nuisance parameters control the hadronization scale and the hadronization temperature, mostly controlling the glueball multiplicity and relative abundance of different glueball species respectively.\nThe study [75] defines a set of 4 benchmark points for these nuisance parameters in each option to represent the range of physically reasonable glueball hadronization possibilities. For phenomenological studies, the range of predictions spanned by these hadronization benchmarks can be interpreted as a theoretical uncertainty on predictions for glueball production. Despite the wide range of possibilities for hadronization that are considered, most glueball observables are predicted within an O(1) factor. This is in large part due to the modest hierarchy between the glueball mass and the confinement scale, which makes most inclusive glueball observables dominantly dependant on the physics of the perturbative gluon shower. However, exclusive production of certain glueball states can vary by up to a factor of 10 depending on hadronization assumptions, a range that accurately represents our current theoretical uncertainty.\nIn summary, to support the increasing interest in dark showers, efforts are being made to ensure the possibility space is covered. Until recently the N fD = 0 limit has been largely ignored due to difficulties in studying pure-glue hadronization. However, such hidden sectors are motivated by both naturalness concerns and as a possible dark matter particle. TheGlueShower tool aims to effectively facilitate studying the N fD = 0 limit, even without a full understanding of the underlying non-perturbative hadronization physics. Despite the current theoretical limitations, this demonstrates that quantitative studies of and searches for glueball signatures can be reliably conducted if the underlying uncertainties are accurately accounted for.\n2 github.com/davidrcurtin/GlueShower."

In this section, we address this problem, going beyond existing efforts in the literature. First, we sketch the importance of lattice calculations to set low energy bound state masses given UV parameters. Second, we illustrate the importance of portal phenomenology and associated symmetry breaking patterns, and use chiral Lagrangian techniques to set the interactions of the low energy bound states among themselves and to the SM final states. Finally, we comment on the hadronization parameters necessary for LHC phenomenology and make some observations for a subset of them. After this, we turn to the simulation of benchmark models consistent with the above observations. We describe the recent improvements to the pythia 8 Hidden Valley module, and present a few benchmarks which are used in later sections for studies."

            "text": "We suppose the Standard Model is extended with a new sector, consisting of an additional non-Abelian gauge group SU (NcD) with N fD degenerate Dirac fermions qD\u03b1 in the fundamental representation, with current mass mqD . We will refer to the new sector as the \u201cdark sector,\u201d though we note this is fully equivalent to a \u201chidden valley\u201d as defined in [36]. This sector has SUL(N fD) \u00d7 SUR(N fD) \u00d7 U (1)B global symmetry broken by the mass term to a diagonal SU (N fD)\u00d7U (1).3 We will assume NcD , N fD are such that the theory confines and has a chiral qD\u03b1qD\u03b1 condensate, which in the absence of mqD would spontaneously break the chiral symmetries and lead to Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons. Instead, as in QCD itself, we have pseudo-Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons with masses that are proportional to \u221a mqD .\nIf the only connection between this sector and the SM is through a mediator (or \u201cportal\u201d) which is either massive or ultra-weakly coupled, then typical confining Hidden-Valleytype phenomenology inevitably results. Specifically, production of the \u201cdark quarks\u201d leads to production of dark hadrons. These will be collimated in jets if the theory is QCD-like and\n3 There is also an axial U (1) which is broken by mqD and an anomaly, though the anomaly disappears in the large NcD limit.\nthe invariant mass of the produced qDqD pair is far above the dark confinement scale. We will specifically consider a mediator in the form of a heavy U (1)\u2032 leptophobic Z\u2032 mediator between SM quarks and the dark quarks. These are the same models introduced in Sect. 2.1.1, used widely in the semi-visible jet searches and are also considered in the dark matter working group [176]. The process qq \u2192 Z\u2032 \u2192 qDqD allows dark hadrons to be produced, while the Z \u2032 also allows some dark hadrons to decay to SM quark-antiquark pairs, leading to an all-hadronic signal. We will assume throughout thatmZ\u2032 is much larger than the confinement scale, by at least \u223c 30, so that the physics in the dark sector actually leads to jets of dark hadrons.4 Because a fraction of the dark hadrons are typically stable, at least on LHC-detector time scales, the observable signal usually consists of at least two relatively fat jets with considerable substructure, and often a high multiplicity of SM hadrons, along with roughly collinear ET. These \u201csemi-visible jets\u201d (SVJ), introduced in Sect. 2.1.1, are the target of the searches in question here.\nThe mediator\u2019s couplings to the dark sector will break the SU (N fD)\u00d7U (1) flavor symmetry to a smaller subgroup G f . Without this breaking, the majority of the dark hadrons would be charged in the adjoint of SU (N fD) and would be unable to decay to a SM final state, which would be a singlet under this symmetry. (Note that decays with both dark and SM particles in the final state would still be permitted.) If the couplings are vector-like, we assign the dark quarks charges Q\u03b1 under the U (1)\u2032, and define the charge matrix Q as a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues Q\u03b1; the group G f is the subgroup of SU (N fD) \u00d7U (1) which commutes with Q. (In chiral models the left- and right-handed quarks have different charges Q\u03b1 and Q\u0303\u03b1 , and get their masses from a Higgs field with charge Q\u03b1 \u2212 Q\u0303\u03b1 . We will not consider such models in detail here.) The precise choice of Q has a significant impact on the phenomenology.\nThe ultraviolet Lagrangian for the hidden sector is\nLD \u2282 \u2212GD,\u03bc\u03bdG\u03bc\u03bdD + qDi /DqD \u2212 mqDqDqD (11)\nwhere GD,\u03bc\u03bd is the gauge field strength tensor and mqD is the current mass of the dark quarks. This part of the theory has two discrete parameters NcD and N fD, and two continuous parameters, the running gauge coupling \u03b1D(\u03bc), with \u03bc a renormalization scale, and the \u201ccurrent\u201d quark mass mqD . Since neither of these parameters has direct contact with the observable phenomena, we replace them with the confinement scale D, or some proxy for it, such as the one-loop dimensional transmutation scale, and the mass m\u03c0D of the light pseudoscalar mesons \u03c0D.\n4 If the two scales are too close, then the physics is analogous to e+e\u2212 \u2192 QCD hadrons at a few GeV: multiplicities are of order 4 to 6 and no jetty structure is seen.\nThe interaction of this sector with the SM via a Z\u2032 mediator takes the form\nLint \u2282 \u2212eDZ\u2032\u03bc \u2211\n\u03b1\nqD\u03b1Q\u03b1\u03b3 \u03bcqD\u03b1 \u2212 gq Z\u2032\u03bc\n\u2211\ni\nqi\u03b3 \u03bcqi (12)\nif the Z\u2032 couplings are vectorlike and the qD\u03b1 have charge Q\u03b1 . (If the couplings to the hidden sector are chiral, separate charge Q\u03b1 and Q\u0303\u03b1 must be assigned for left- and righthanded hidden quarks.) We will assume all SM quarks have the same charge under U (1)\u2032 for simplicity, though in realistic models one must account for the differences, which can affect observables, such as the SM heavy flavor fractions in the SVJs.\nOne other issue of importance is whether the Z\u2032 and the qD obtain their masses from the same source, in such a way that the longitudinal polarization of the Z\u2032 mixes with the \u03c0D from chiral symmetry breaking. Similar mixing of the SM charged pion with the W bosons allows the classic decay \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd. By analogy, the Z\u2032 mixing with the \u03c0D affects the decays of the latter to the SM."

            "text": "The SU (NcD) confines at around the scale D and various dark hadronic bound states are produced. In the exact SU (N fD) limit, the lightest hadrons consist of the spin0 flavor-adjoint \u03c0D, which are pseudo-Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons (PNGBs), the spin-1 flavor-adjoint \u03c1D, the spin-1 flavor-singlet \u03c9D, and the spin-0 flavor-singlet \u03b7\u2032D. In general m\u03c0D < m\u03c1D m\u03c9D, while the \u03b7\u2032D mass depends on the anomaly, which scales like \u221a N fD/NcD when it is dominant. Thus for N fD flavors, the theory contains N 2 fD\n\u2212 1 mass-degenerate pions and an equal number of degenerate rho mesons, along with an omega which will be slightly heavier than the rhos, and an eta-prime which may be neardegenerate with the pions for N fD NcD but is much heavier for N fD \u223c NcD. In addition there are baryons and antibaryons with mass of order NcD D (bosons for NcD even, fermions otherwise), except for NcD = 2 in which case they are exactly degenerate with the pions and are themselves PNGBs. We note from these remarks that N fD = 1 and NcD = 2 are special cases, which must be treated with care.\nThere are ambiguities in defining the scale D. One way to define it is via the running gauge coupling \u03b1D(\u03bc) at one loop. As pointed out by \u2019t Hooft, physics in the large NcD limit depends mainly on \u03b1D(\u03bc)NcD, up to 1/NcD corrections. Lattice results show that NcD = 3 is already close to NcD = \u221e, and moreover the physics of a QCD-like shower has very small 1/NcD corrections, a fact that the pythia showering\nroutines take advantage of. With this in mind, the one-loop running coupling can be written in a form familiar from QCD:\n\u03b1D(\u03bc 2)NcD =\n[ 1\n2\u03c0\n( 11\n3 \u2212 2 3 N fD NcD\n) log ( \u03bc\nD\n)]\u22121 . (13)\nThis form emphasizes that the physics of this theory is really a function of N fD/NcD, with 1/NcD corrections, for large NcD. To this end in Fig. 13(left), we show the running of \u03b1D at one lop for several values of NcD/N fD for a fixed D = 1 GeV.\nAlthough the one-loop formula for D is currently used in the pythia8 HV module and by us throughout this document, this situation should be viewed as temporary. Inevitably, this method indexes non-perturbative hadronic masses to a scale which is perturbative, and this may pose challenges for interpreting results from lattice gauge theory in which D is often defined non-perturbatively, for instance through the string tension. Moreover, the connection between this one-loop estimate of D and the physical confinement scale becomes less and less accurate as N fD/NcD increases; two-loop effects become important, with the effect that non-perturbative definitions of D will be much smaller than the one-loop definition. It seems likely a two-loop perturbative definition would be significantly closer to non-perturbative ones. To illustrate for this effect in Fig. 13(right) we demonstrate the effect of two loop correction for running of \u03b1D (solid lines) in comparison with the corresponding one loop correction (dashed lines), for two different values of N fD = 3, 6 with fixed value of NcD = 3 keeping D = 1 GeV. In order to derive this result, we have used the procedure as described in [177] with beta function as defined in [178].\nIn fact for sufficiently large N fD/NcD the theory will no longer confine because its running coupling reaches an infrared fixed point. The values for NcD , N fD where this occurs are not precisely known. For various NcD, estimates of the value of N fD above which the theory is believed not to confine are computed in e.g. [179] and tabulated in Table 2. These results suggest that theories with N fD < 3NcD likely confine, and we will refer to them as \u201cQCD-like\u201d theories.\nAgain, we have at this time only used the one-loop formula above to define D, and we use the same definition for the parameterLambda in pythia 8, which is perhaps reasonable for N fD/NcD \u223c 1 or below. But it is important to note that for N fD/NcD \u2192 3, the one-loop running is inaccurate and at a minimum a two-loop formula (within which the fixed points at large NcD , N fD can be observed) ought to be used (Fig. 21).\nThe masses and couplings of the low-lying bound states are a direct consequence of UV parameters, but are not calculable analytically. Rough estimates of these quantities can be obtained by combining lattice gauge theory calculations with the chiral Lagrangian for spin-0 mesons, extended by including spin-one mesons as though they were flavor-symmetry gauge bosons. It is convenient to set the overall scale of the\ndark hadrons using a non-perturbative definition of the confinement scale, which we will call \u0303D and specify later, and to express all other dimensionful dark-hadronic quantities in terms of this parameter. Once we have fixed \u0303D as the overall hadronic scale, and specified the ratio\nm\u03c0D \u0303D \u221d \u221a mqD \u0303D (where the relation m\u03c0D \u223c \u221amqD follows from the chiral Lagrangian), everything else should be computable in principle.\nSuch lattice calculations for mass degenerate fermions in the fundamental representation of SU (N ) gauge theories are available in abundance, albeit in the quenched approximation, see e.g. [180\u2013183]. A particularly useful resource is [184], which summarises the spectrum of mesons in the large-N limit of QCD-like theories. These calculations can be used to determine the ratios of the dark hadron masses as a function of the hidden sector parameters.\nUsing lattice calculations and fits plotted in Fig. 19 of [185], we can relate the dark quark mass to the dark pion mass and the dark rho mass. We express these in terms of \u0303D defined as the chiral limit (m\u03c0 \u2192 0) of the \u03c1 mass divided by 2.37. (In terms of the physical units used in Fig. 19 of [185], this puts the analogue of \u0303D for physical QCD at 300 MeV.) These relations are concretely shown in Fig. 22. Our analytic fits to the curves shown are\nm\u03c0D \u0303D = 5.5 \u221a mqD \u0303D m\u03c1D \u0303D = \u221a 5.76 + 1.5m\u03c0D 2 \u03032D . (14)\nThe fit functions and coefficients shown in Eq. 14 are appropriate for small m\u03c0D/\u0303D, though they work far beyond this expectation, and begin to differ from lattice computations by > 10% only for m\u03c0D/\u0303D > 2.3.\nThe relation between the perturbative D of Eq. 13 (or its higher-loop version) and the non-perturbative \u0303D, defined in terms of the chiral limit of m\u03c1D (or some other similar definition), is not established. Although they are proportional, the proportionality depends on NcD and N fD (mostly on N fD/NcD.) In what follows, we will assume they are the same. The uncertainties and inaccuracies that result from this choice can only be reduced in future through more careful matching between perturbative and non-peturbative quantities.\nThe spin-1 singlet is expected to be nearly degenerate with the spin-1 adjoint hadrons, so there is little importance in giving it a different mass.5 By contrast, the spin-0 singlet is expected to be heavier than the spin-0 adjoint, possibly by a large amount if N fD \u223c NcD, due to the axial anomaly. Some analysis of QCD hadrons using the chiral Lagrangian, which we will present elsewhere, suggests\nm2 \u03b7\u2032D \u2248 m\u03c0D 2 + N fD NcD (3\u0303D) 2. (15)\nThus for N fD \u223c NcD, as in SM QCD, the splitting of the spin0 singlet from the adjoint is large. Note that the factor of 3 in front of \u0303D depends on the precise definition of the corresponding \u0303QCD , and will retain some uncertainties until this definition is handled more carefully. In any case, our current benchmark models presented below do not account for the anomaly term, and instead treat the \u03b7\u2032D as degenerate with\n5 Its decays are potentially another matter, but we have not yet attempted to treat them carefully.\nthe \u03c0D. However, the new version of pythia 8 includes a parameter HiddenValley:separateFlav, described in Sect. 4.1.4 below; when it is set \u201con,\u201d the \u03b7\u2032D mass can be set separately from that of the \u03c0D states.\nFor the scenarios we are interested in, a hard process leads to production of dark quarks which shower over a wide energy range; the shower then subsequently hadronizes. Hadronization in the dark sector is a far more challenging problem, because neither lattice calculations nor effective field theory methods are applicable to this process. All we know of it arises from studies of QCD data, and in particular through the use of phenomenological models (such as the Lund string model used in pythia, or the clustering model used in Herwig) whose parameters are tuned to fit experimental results. Currently there is no theoretical insight into how these models or their parameters should be adjusted for different values of NcD, N fD, or m\u03c0D/ D. Consequently we take existing parameterizations from data as a starting point. One must vary these parameters within reason to obtain a sense of uncertainties.\nIn the present context, we are using pythia 8\u2019s HV module, whose four main parametersHiddenValley:aLund, HiddenValley:bmqv2, HiddenValley:rFactqv, HiddenValley:sigmamqv parallel those of the corresponding QCD hadronization routine. The dimensionless HV parameters are set to exactly the same values as the dimensionless QCD parameters, while those with dimensions are scaled by the ratio of constituent quark mass parameter mqv = 4900101:m0 (which is not the current quark mass mqD but rather a phenomenological parameter, of order D for small mqD) to the constituent quark mass in QCD, which for u, d quarks is 330 MeV. There are other parameter tunes proposed by pythia 8 experts, see for example the Monash tune [186]. It is probably wise to try two or more tunes that are known to work in QCD as a means of estimating a minimum systematic error from this source. However, we have not studied this, and so further investigation is needed before an informed recommendation can be made.\nThere are three other hadronization parameters that are currently in use in the HV module. About the parameter HiddenValley:probVector, which gives the probability that a new meson formed in the hadronization should be assigned to spin-1 rather than spin-0, we have two pieces of information. Were spin-0 and spin-1 mesons massdegenerate (appropriate for m\u03c0D/ D 1 and bordering on unphysical for the Lund model), we would expect probVector = 0.75 based on spin counting (three spin-1 states versus one spin-0 state.) Data from QCD, with m\u03c0/ QCD \u223c 0.5, suggests use of probVector = 0.5, downweighting spin-1 presumably because of phase space.6 From this we learn that the appropriate probVector is a slowly increasing function of m\u03c0/ QCD . It would be reasonable to choose a phase-spacemotivated functional form for this function, with a smooth m\u03c0D \u2192 0 limit, but we have not made an effort to do this. Little is known about the limit m\u03c0D \u2192 0; it is not even clear that the Lund model is accurate there.\nWhen the parameterHiddenValley:separateFlav (included in the new version of pythia 8 and described in Sect. 4.1.4) is set \u201con\u201d, the parameter HiddenValley: probKeepEta1 downweights the probability of producing a singlet \u03b7\u2032D meson relative to other diagonal mesons. This should be set to 1 when NcD N fD since in the large-NcD limit (with N fD fixed) the axial anomaly is negligible and the \u03b7\u2032D is like the adjoint-flavor bosons. Conversely it should be set to a small value when N fD is of order or greater than NcD and the \u03b7\u2032D is heavy, as it is in QCD; in pythia 8, the corresponding QCD parameter StringFlav:etaPrimeSup is set by default to 0.12.\n6 See settings for StringFlav:mesonUDvector in pythia 8. It should be noted this value in the SM is subject to the tune used, for example the default pythia 8 value is 0.62, which is reduced to 0.5 in Monash tune.\nFinally, the option of allowing baryons in hadronization for NcD = 3 can be controlled with the parameter HiddenValley:probDiquark; this determines the likelihood of pair-producing diquarks, which, for NcD = 3 only, combine with a quark to form a baryon. We have not validated this parameter and recommend that for now baryons (at most a 10% effect, which is probably smaller than hadronization uncertainties) should not yet be used."

The decay patterns depend on the charge matrix Q and the dark hadron mass hierarchy. In particular, when the mass m\u03c1D is larger than twice m\u03c0D, the \u03c1D decay to \u03c0D\u03c0D. In the regime where such decays are not allowed some of the \u03c1D may decay back to the SM via mixing with the Z\u2032. The details of these decay modes however are determined by the group algebra and need careful treatment. We outline below the salient considerations in setting such decay modes. Region 1: Dark sector decays 2m\u03c0D < m\u03c1D\nWhen the decay channel \u03c1D \u2192 \u03c0D\u03c0D is open, it dominates all other decays since g\u03c1D\u03c0D\u03c0D is large compared to any other coupling (Fig. 23 left).

(17)\nThis mixing typically arises because a Higgs field (whose scalar is assumed too heavy to be of interest here) gives mass to both the Z\u2032 and the quarks qD, typically along with some additional flavor violation. The exact details of the mixing and corresponding lifetimes depends on precise modelbuilding.\nBecause the decay in Eq. 17 is helicity-suppressed, the width for this process is of order |yq |2m\u03c0D 5/m4Z\u2032 or smaller, where yq is the Yukawa coupling of the Standard Model quark; the heaviest kinematically-accessible quarks dominate. Note this width is parametrically small and low-mass \u03c0D will have displaced decays. To determine if a particular\n7 The fate of the spin-1 singlet is a separate issue that we do not discuss here.\n\u03c0D decays promptly, its lifetime needs to be calculated in a consistent leptophobic model, but to our knowledge the relevant model building has not been done.\nFurthermore, we do not treat the flavor singlet \u03b7\u2032D in detail here as our analysis is not yet complete. For N fD NcD it is heavy, as in QCD, and rarely produced. Similarly, since baryons are only available for NcD = 3, where they are a small effect, we do not discuss them here.\nWe conclude by noting that one should keep in mind that the Z\u2032 charge assignments also determines the decay branching fractions of the Z\u2032. Especially when dark hadron multiplicities are small in Z\u2032 decays, this introduces a small but significant correlation in the flavors of the dark hadrons, This will become more important in future studies with nondegenerate quark masses. Region 2: Dark sector decays 2m\u03c0D > m\u03c1D\nIn this case we will assume that there is no mixing between the Z\u2032 and the \u03c0D \u2013 that the quarks and the Z\u2032 get their masses from separate sources. The hidden pions charged under G f are then stable and invisible. The precise fate of the other singlets needs further investigation. Some may be stable due to a discrete symmetry. Others are obviously unstable due to standard flavor anomalies, though the details depend on the matrix Q. Decays to one or two SM qq pairs have small widths because of powers of 1/m2Z\u2032 factors along with loop factors or phase space factors. In general these particles will be very long-lived on LHC detector time-scales, and thus a source only of ET. This statement may however be modeldependent and so one must be careful to compute the lifetimes for these states in a particular model. We assume here that all \u03c0D are LHC-detector stable.\nThe decays of the \u03c1D, however, can be observed. First, there can be mixing between the Z\u2032 and the \u03c1D mesons which are singlets under the group G f . These decays \u03c1D \u2192 (Z\u2032)\u2217 \u2192 qq are not helicity suppressed and are thus faster than the corresponding \u03c0D decays that we discussed in the previous section (Fig. 23 middle).\nFor those \u03c1D that are non-singlet under G f , flavor symmetry would not prevent the decay (Fig. 23 right)\n\u03c1D \u2192 \u03c0D + (Z\u2032)\u2217 \u2192 \u03c0D q q. The \u03c1D and the \u03c0D in this decay have the same G f quantum numbers, while the qq are a flavor singlet. This decay would be prohibited by the naive symmetry \u03c0D \u2192 \u2212\u03c0D in the chiral Lagrangian, but this symmetry is violated by the usual chiral anomaly that mediates \u03c00 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay in QCD, and allows a \u03c1D\u03c1D\u03c0D coupling in this context. Mixing between a G f -singlet \u03c1D and a Z\u2032 then induces a \u03c1DZ\u2032\u03c0D coupling, which permits this decay to proceed. Specifically\n(\u03c1aD \u2192 \u03c0bDqq) \u221d |dabcTr(T cQ)|2 \u221d |Tr({T a, T b} Q)|2\nwhere dabc appears in the anti-commutator [187]\n{T a, T b} = 1 NcD \u03b4ab + dabcT c.\nImportantly, however, Tr({T a, T b} Q) can vanish. If this occurs, then this decay channel is not available. For instance, if T a is the matrix whose (\u03b1, \u03b2) entry is 1 and whose other entries are all zero, then the above trace is proportional to Q\u03b1 + Q\u03b2 . Equal and opposite eigenvalues in Q then assure that the corresponding \u03c1D does not decay via the anomaly. Although this does not guarantee that this particle is stable against decay via higher-order processes, it does mean that it has a very long lifetime and is likely LHC-stable.\nBecause this decay has a 3-body phase space and because by assumption m\u03c1D \u2212 m\u03c0D < 12m\u03c1D, this decay is heavily suppressed, and will lead to displaced vertices if m\u03c1D/mZ\u2032 is too small.

(18) In addition, we have used\n|g\u03c1D\u03c1D\u03c0D | = NcDg\n2 \u03c1D\u03c0D\u03c0D\n8\u03c02 f\u03c0D (19)\nand g\u03c1D\u03c0D\u03c0D = m\u03c1D/( \u221a\n2 f\u03c0D). The former relationship and in particular the factor of NcD arises from SU (NcD) symmetry [188] while the latter is KSFR relationship [189,190], and eD, gq are defined in Eq. 12.8 For these decays to be prompt, the ratio m11\u03c1D/m 4 Z\u2032 must not be too small. It should further be noted that f\u03c0D also includes a mild NcD dependence [181]. As above, we do not discuss the \u03b7\u2032D, the \u03c9D or baryons here.\n4.1.4 Updates and inputs for PYTHIA 8 hidden valley module\nThe pythia 8 hidden valley module has received an update in version 8.307, after having been stable for some years. One update is substantive; the previous versions were overproducing very soft hidden hadrons (mainly pions) at low pT. This bug fix slightly affects many plots, as we will see in Sect. 4.3; for example it affects the total multiplicity of hadrons. Fortunately, the methods used in previous SVJ analyses are not\n8 See also [33,191] for a discussion of this decay. We note here that we disagree with formula as given in [33].\nvery sensitive to this effect, which leaves total visible energy in a jet, the ET aimed in its direction, and most substructure variables roughly unchanged. The possible exception is for variables which are not infrared safe, most notably pTD; see 4.3.\nThe other main change has been to increase the flexibility of the module. Depending on a newly introduced flag separateFlav, the simulation in each regime may proceed in two ways. An imperfect but often sufficient simulation, which was already available in pythia 8.150, is available with separateFlav=off; in this case the full adjoint multiplets of spin-0 and spin-1 mesons are each simplified into two states, one flavor-diagonal and one flavor-offdiagonal. This division is not consistent with most choices of Q, as it requires that G f = U (1)N fD . However, as long as all dark hadrons are stable (on LHC timescales) or decay promptly, it is possible to mock up other choices of Q, where for instance only a fraction of the flavor-diagonal states would decay visibly, by assigning the flavor-diagonal meson a probability to decay to a visible SM state and a corresponding probability to decay invisibly.\nAlternatively, the setting separateFlav=on allows full control over all the spin-0 and spin-1 states; separate lifetimes and decay modes can be assigned to each. The particle ID number for the spin-0 (spin-1) meson with quark i and anti-quark j is 4900ij1 (4900ij3), at least for i = j . For i = j the situation is more complicated since the diagonal mesons are flavor mixtures; for example, with N fD = 3, the pion is a uu \u2212 dd state and the \u03b7 is a uu + dd \u2212 2ss state (ignoring normalizations). Typically one may order the diagonal flavoradjoint mesons in a canonical way, through the increasing number of quark flavors appearing in their wavefunctions (or equivalently by the increasing number of non-zero entries in the corresponding diagonal SU (N fD) generator). The flavorsinglet state is always (1/ \u221a N fD) \u2211 \u03b1 qD\u03b1qD\u03b1 and is always assigned particle 4900FF1 (4900FF3) where F \u2261 N fD . This is important because this state has special status, see below.\nThis setting then requires the user to create a full decay table for of order N 2fD dark hadrons. Although we will comment on the settings for this below, we have not yet auto-\nmated this task, so at this time we have no benchmarks for separateFlav=on. It also permits the hidden quarks to have different masses, but we have not yet validated this capability and more studies are needed.\nOther changes, not utilized below, are in the treatment of the flavor singlets, especially for spin-0, and baryons for NcD = 3. Since the flavor singlets can be given different masses with separateFlav=on, this allows for a more accurate spectrum. The masses of the singlets should be assigned to the spin-0 and spin-1 particle ID codes 4900FF1 and 4900FF3. This is especially important for spin-0 because the singlet can have a much larger mass than the adjoint due to the axial anomaly, as for the \u03b7\u2032 in QCD. As we mentioned above, an additional parameterprobKeepEta1, which can be chosen between 0 and 1, has been added; this reduces the probability of producing of the \u03b7\u2032D relative to other spin-0 mesons in the hadronization process. Meanwhile the routines for producing baryons in the SM sector have been activated for the HV sector as well, but only work for NcD = 3. (For NcD > 3 this is not a concern since baryon production would be highly suppressed. For NcD = 2 a special routine must be written, because baryons, antibaryons and mesons are all degenerate; this is why the current HV module should not be used for NcD = 2, at least not without careful consideration of how to reinterpret its results). For now, only one type of diquark is produced, that of qD1qD1. All the baryons produced are assumed to have spin 3/2 and to have one of the N fD quark flavors i combined with a single flavor of diquark, with particle ID code 490i114. For separateFlav=off, all of these states are conflated into the state with i = 1.\nWe have mentioned that pythia 8\u2019s hadronization routine cannot simulate a theory with N fD = 1 or NcD = 2, but it may fail for other reasons. For any choices of N fD and NcD, one should avoid overly small or large values of m\u03c0D/ D. At small values approaching the chiral limit, theoretical understanding of hadronization is lacking, and the Lund string model used in pythia 8 may not function in any case; meanwhile at large values other hadrons (glueballs, in particular) will become as important as pions or rhos, but are not included in the Lund string model. To be conservative,\nwe suggest limiting studies to 0.25 < m\u03c0D/ D < 2 until there has been further theoretical work on this issue.\nWe now turn to the pythia 8 parameters that must be set to simulate the models discussed above. We begin with those that are independent of whether separateFlav=off or separateFlav=on.\n\u2022 HiddenValley:Ngauge, HiddenValley:nFlav \u2013 These are NcD and N fD; the former should always be set greater than 2 and the latter should always be set greater than 1. (For NcD = 2 or N fD = 1, pythia 8 is currently missing essential dark hadrons and gives an inaccurate simulation.) \u2022 Constituent dark quark mass 4900101:m0 \u2013 The quark mass defined in pythia 8 is the constituent quark mass, not the current quark mass. This quantity has never been given a theoretical definition, but may be roughly defined by mqconst \u2248 mqD +O(1)\u00d7 D. For definiteness we will use this relation with the coefficient fixed to 1, namely mqconst \u2261 mqD + D. \u2022 Confinement scale HiddenValley:Lambda \u2013 This can be defined in multiple ways, but we take it for now to be the scale at which the running gauge coupling constant diverges at 1-loop order, since currently the PYTHI8HV module has implemented the running coupling at one loop. As we have mentioned above, further consideration of this definition is warranted. The associated behaviour is illustrated in Fig. 21. \u2022 Lund model hadronization parameters must be set: HiddenValley:aLund, HiddenValley:bmqv2, HiddenValley:rFactqv, HiddenValley:sig mamqv; see Sect. 4.1.1. The effects of these parameters on the underlying phenomenology have not yet been investigated, so we make no specific recommendations for them beyond the existing default settings. \u2022 Certain hadronization parameters must be set, such as HiddenValley:probVector; see Sect. 4.1.1.\nNext, if separateFlav=off, only two additional parameters must be defined.\n\u2022 Dark pion mass 4900111:m0, 4900211:m0. These are the masses of the bound state spin-0 multiplets; they should always be taken equal.9 Within the chiral regime, these may be related to the confinement scale D and current quark mass mqD via Eq. 14. However, we advise taking this observable as an input parameter and viewing mqD , which is scheme-dependent, as an output.\n9 The spin-0 states also include the flavor-singlet \u03b7\u2032D, which, as discussed in Eq. 15, can be relatively heavy. However there is no way to take this into account for separateFlav=off.\n\u2022 Dark rho mass 4900113:m0, 4900213:m0. These are the masses of the bound state spin-1 multiplets, and should always be taken equal.10 Within the chiral regime, these are related to the confinement scale D and the dark pion mass 4900111:m0 using Eq. 14.\nIn addition, decay channels and lifetimes for these four states must be defined by the user.\nIf instead separateFlav=on, then even for the massdegenerate case, all spin-0 and all spin-1 mesons must have separately defined masses, 4900ij1:m0, 4900ij3:m0 for N fD \u2265 i \u2265 j \u2265 1. Note the flavor singlets have particle ID codes 4900iis with i = N fD and s = 1, 3; the user may wish to change probKeepEta1 which can be used to suppress the spin-0 singlet production. Again the user must define all lifetimes and decay channels, now for a much larger set of particles. Depending on the model, it may be very important to ensure that the flavor structure of the decays is precisely specified, as is emphasized in the earlier Eqs. 16 and 18."

            "text": "We have created benchmarks for the purpose of the studies in Sect. 4.3. We are implicitly assuming dark hadron lifetimes are short enough to be considered prompt, as appropriate for the SVJ signatures. For low-mass dark hadrons, this is far from obvious. Lifetimes need to be calculated in the context of complete models, but constructing such models is no simple matter in the context of a leptophobic Z\u2032 because of potential U (1)\u2032 gauge anomalies that would make the theory inconsistent. We are not aware of any complete calculations of dark hadron lifetimes in this context, so we must warn the user that some of these benchmarks, especially those with light \u03c0D, may not be realizable theoretically.\nLet us first note what all the benchmarks have in common. In each case\n\u2022 mZ\u2032 = 1 TeV; \u2022 We take separateFlav=off.\nVersions of the benchmarks with separateFlav=on would be more accurate in their treatment of flavor-singlets, but will have to be created at a later time.\nWe have several benchmarks with m\u03c0D < 1 2m\u03c1D.\n\u2022 All have NcD = N fD = 3. \u2022 All have m\u03c0D = 0.6 D (and thus m\u03c1D = 2.6 D by\nEq. 14).\n10 Although the spin-1 states include the flavor-singlet \u03c9D, analogous to the spin-0 \u03b7\u2032D, it is expected to be close in mass to the other spin-1 states, as noted in Sect. 4.1.1.\n\u2022 Because of this choice, the parameter probVec is taken to be 0.5, since m\u03c0D/ D is similar to its value used in real-world QCD. \u2022 Three choices of D are considered: 5 GeV, 10 GeV and 50 GeV. \u2022 For each of these, the number of stable diagonal spin-0 mesons is k = 0, 1 or 2, with 3 \u2212 k decaying to the SM; since the six off-diagonal pions are stable in this model, this gives rinv = (6 + k)/9. \u2022 The dark pions are assumed to decay promptly and only to cc (charm being the heaviest kinematically-allowed SM quark for the smaller values of D).\nThe choice of k depends on mixing among the singlet and diagonal adjoint pions and the Z\u2032. The details, especially the interplay between mixings and lifetimes, require careful model-building. We are not aware of any papers in which this has been done.\nNote that the use of separateFlav=off means that we do not treat the SU (N fD) flavor singlets separately from the other mesons. For NcD = 3 the \u03b7\u2032D is much heavier than the other states, and this is not correctly modeled. In particular, it leads to a small correction to rinv. For NcD N fD , the splitting between the flavor adjoint and singlet states becomes small, so the use of separateFlav=off is less problematic there.\nFor m\u03c0D < 1 2m\u03c1D, we have so far defined only one bench-\nmark\n\u2022 NcD = 3, N fD = 4. \u2022 D = 10 GeV, m\u03c0D = 17 GeV, m\u03c1D = 31.8 GeV \u2022 The parameter probVec is taken to be 0.58, in between\nthe values of 0.5 (as used for QCD) and 0.75 (as appropriate for m\u03c0D \u2248 m\u03c1D). \u2022 Q = {\u22121, 2, 3,\u22124}, a choice that ensures that no \u03c1D are stable. \u2022 All spin-0 mesons are assumed to be stable on LHCdetector time-scales. \u2022 All diagonal spin-1 mesons (including the singlet, which we do not treat carefully) decay to all available SM qq pairs. \u2022 All off-diagonal spin-1 mesons decay to SM qq plus an invisible spin-0 meson.\nTable 3 summarises our current benchmarks. To compose benchmarks with separateFlav=on, there are a number of additional steps needed. For m\u03c0D < 1 2m\u03c1D, the decays \u03c1 a D \u2192 \u03c0bD\u03c0cD need to be correctly programmed. For example, for N fD = 3, \u03c13D, the diagonal member of the rho isotriplet (particle ID 4900113), decays to spin0 bosons \u03c0 i jD (particle ID 4900ij1) in the following pattern:\n\u03c13D(4900113) \u2192 \u03c012D \u03c021D (66%), \u03c013D \u03c031D (16%),\n\u03c023D \u03c0 21 D (16%),\nthe 4:1:1 branching ratios reflecting the relative isospinssquared of these spin-0 states. All of these details need to be correctly laid out in the pythia decay table in order that spin-0 mesons be produced in the right abundances. It is also important to decide how to treat the singlet states, especially the spin-0 singlet whose mass and production rate in hadronization may be quite different from the others. Finally, all the spin-0 meson decays and lifetimes must be separately entered into the pythia decay table.\nFor m\u03c0D > 1 2m\u03c1D, similar efforts are required to ensure that the flavor structure of the diagonal and off-diagonal \u03c1D decays are correctly implemented in the decay table."

            "text": "Before we proceed with phenomenological studies using the benchmarks proposed in this section, we would like to emphasize that we have only laid out an initial road for defining consistent phenomenology in the context of semi-visible jets. We have considered the leptophobic Z\u2032 SM\u2013DS portal widely used in the semi-visible jets literature, and pointed out the crucial role of charge assignments in determining the phenomenology, though we have not worked out the details. Dark hadron masses may potentially be extracted from a combination of lattice simulation of the hidden sector and general theoretical considerations. But their decay channels and lifetimes are highly model-dependent, and calculating them involves careful consideration of the detailed charge assignments of the Z\u2032, its mixing with various dark hadrons, and the spectrum and interactions of the dark hadrons (including anomalies) as obtained from symmetry considerations and the chiral Lagrangian. These sometimes intricate calculations must be performed in each model, unless an over-arching theoretical treatment, covering all models in this class, can be given.\nIn the context of semi-visible jets, the lifetimes of the various states are particularly important. This signature is defined to be one in which all objects either are stable, producing ET, or decay promptly to SM-hadronic final states. Long-lived particles with lifetimes greater than a few centimeters and less than 10 meters (in the lab frame) would move the signature into a different regime, outside the semivisible jet framework. It is therefore imperative to identify all unstable dark hadrons and calculate their lifetimes correctly. We have estimated lifetimes and have moderate confidence that all particles in our benchmarks decay promptly or are stable on LHC detector scales, but we have not by any means done a thorough analysis.\nWe would also like to note that there are still significant issues with hadronization that we have not begun to address. We have made a few observations about the hadronization\nparameters used in the pythia 8 HV module, but have neither attempted to explore the impact of their uncertainty on the underlying phenomenology, nor made concrete statements about what ranges of values they might take. These questions, and even deeper ones about how hadronization models perform in other regimes, such as the chiral limit (m\u03c0D D), must be left for future studies.\n4.2 Improvements on the PYTHIA8 Hidden Valley Module and their validation\nContributors: Guillaume Albouy, Cesare Cazzaniga, Annapaola de Cosa, Florian Eble, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Genest, Nicoline Hemme, Suchita Kulkarni, StephenMrenna, Ana Peixoto, Akanksha Singh, Torbj\u00f6rn Sj\u00f6strand, Matt Strassler"

            "text": "The signal process considered for the validation of new Hidden Valley (HV) Module of pythia 8 [192,193] consists of semi-visible jets [2] produced in the s-channel via a heavy Z\u2032 mediator. A set of signal samples has been produced with different versions of pythia 8 for proton-proton collisions (and also electron-positron collisions for completeness) at the benchmark centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV (1 TeV). Namely, in order to test the new implementation of the HV Module we have produced three main groups of samples as illustrated in Table 4 for different dark sector color charge NcD and dark quark flavor N fD choices.\nIn particular, the first type of samples have been produced with an older pythia 8.245 release [194],11 while the second one have been generated with the new pythia 8 version 8.307 [195].\n11 We do not expect major changes to the outcome of our study even if we would have used pythia 8.306, the immediate predecessor of pythia 8.307 which we validate in this section.\nIn the new pythia 8 release, it is now possible to set the masses of all 8 dark quarks and associated 64 mesons for each pseudo-scalar and vector multiplet individually. Even if this allows to consider mass split scenarios, we consider only mass degenerate dark quarks since a consistent treatment for UV to IR settings in mass split scenario is not yet available. As an outcome of this choice, flavor symmetry leads to mass degenerate pseudo-scalar and vector multiplets. However, it is still crucial to have the possibility to set all dark mesons properties individually since the lifetimes of these different states can differ according to the model and mediator. Following these necessities, compared to pythia 8.245 (8.306) release, in the newest version a more detailed handling of dark hadrons is possible with the setting HiddenValley:SeparateFlav = on. As shown in Table 4, a third sample has been added in order to test this new option. In particular, using the flavor splitting option, each of the quark and meson flavors are shown explicitly. The quark names now are qDi , with i \u2208 {0, . . . , N fD}. Similarly, meson names are \u03c0Di j and \u03c1Di j , where i = j are the flavor-diagonal mesons, and else i > j , with j representing the anti-quark. The identity codes then are 4900i j1 for pseudo-scalars and 4900i j3 for vectors. An anti-meson comes with an overall negative sign, and here i gives the anti-quark. The data tables by default contain identical properties for all diagonal mesons in a multiplet. All nondiagonal mesons of a multiplet are also assumed to be identical and stable by default.\nAn advantage of the SeparateFlav=on option, is the possibility of setting masses (as well as decay modes) of spin-0,1 flavour singlets differently than the corresponding multiplets. As discussed in Sect. 4.1, the exact computation of the flavor singlet mass with respect to the flavor multiplets, especially for spin-0 states, is an open question. There are indications that spin-0 singlets tend to be heavier than their multiplet counterparts, and therefore for these states a\nsuppression of the production rate is also expected. For this reason, the option HiddenValley:probKeepEta1 can be set in pythia 8.307 in order to specify the suppression factor for the spin-0 flavor singlets production rates. This feature has been tested in the validation procedure, but we do not report plots related to this.\nFixing the color charge to NcD = 3 using the option HiddenValley:Ngauge = 3, two configurations for the number of flavors N fD = 3, 8 have been considered in this study, using the setting HiddenValley:Nflav. N fD = 3 corresponds to the smallest possible configuration with more particles than the triplet representation used in pythia 8.245 , while N fD = 8 is the maximal number of flavors implemented in pythia HV module. Choosing these two values, we thus test the extremes of the flavor configurations. The hidden valley partners FD of the SM particles (charged both under both SM and hidden valley group) are assumed to be decoupled in our case, such that they will not produce interleaved showers between the hidden sector and the SM [192,193]. While in the pythia 8.245 release only dark mesons originating from string fragmentation are implemented, in pythia 8.307 tested in this study an option to produce dark baryons has been added with the line HiddenValley:probDiquark = on. With this option, it is possible to set the probability that a string breaks by \u201cdiquark\u2013antidiquark\u201d production rather than quark\u2013antiquark one. This then leads to an adjacent baryon\u2013 antibaryon pair in the flavor chain. Currently only one kind of diquark is implemented, implying at most eight different Delta baryons Di if HiddenValley:SeparateFlav = on. In the validation procedure of pythia 8.307 of the HV module we have considered decoupled Delta baryons.\nA minimal number of input parameters have to be specified in pythia 8 when the Hidden Valley module is called with the option HiddenValley:fragment = on. In particular, the masses of the dark hadrons have to be fixed as well as the dark sector hadronization scale D (set to 10 GeV in this study). Furthermore, the masses of pseudoscalar states are set to 6 GeV, and the masses of the vector mesons are chosen to be 25 GeV. These settings correspond to \u03c0D/ D = 0.6 same as that considered in benchmarks in Sect. 4.1. The final states configuration that we chose for\nour study is simply a fully invisible signature where all the dark hadrons are considered to be stable. A further relevant setting which must be specified is the running of the dark sector coupling \u03b1D which can be switched on with the option HiddenValley:alphaOrder = 1.\nFor the purposes of this study, for efficient MC generation, we consider a simplified scenario where the Z\u2032 mediator decays only to dark quarks, even if in a real physics case the non-vanishing coupling to SM-quarks contributes to the branching ratios. By default the Z\u2032 mediator nominal width Z\u2032 of the Z\u2032 boson is set to 20 GeV and the mass mZ\u2032 = 1 TeV. Figure 24 shows the invariant mass distribution for the Z\u2032 boson using the dark quarks before parton shower and hadronization in the hidden sector. The distribution deviates from the Breit\u2013Wigner showing an excess of events in the low mass tail. This effect can be explained from the factorisation theorem considering that parton distribution functions blows up for low transferred momentum fractions for the SM incoming partons. Since we are only interested in typical events where a Z\u2032 boson is created to have a consistent comparison between the different samples, we choose to cut away the low mass tail requiring the generated invariant mass of the Z\u2032 to be within the range [800, 1200] GeV."

            "text": "PYTHIA8 triplet implementation In a two flavor theory there are 4 spin-0 states (and 4 spin-1 states); 1 diagonal and 2 off-diagonals, which make up the triplet, and an additional singlet. In the current pythia 8 release there are only 3 PIDs for dark pions (3 PIDs for \u03c1D mesons), which signify the positive and the negative off-diagonal and the diagonal dark pion. However, the singlet is still produced in pythia 8 and shares the same PID as the diagonal dark pion. With HiddenValley:SeparateFlav=off option, it is thus impossible to separate out the singlet: it is produced with the same probability as that of the diagonal dark pion. As the singlet is considered to be another diagonal dark pion in pythia 8, the ratio of diagonal to off-diagonal dark pions is 1:1 for N fD = 2. In other words, pythia 8 will create an even amount of diagonal and off-diagonal dark mesons, and hence\nZ\u2032 = 20 GeV)\nthe PID for the diagonal dark pions (\u03c1D mesons), 111 (113), is equally as likely as the PIDs for off-diagonal dark pions (\u03c1D mesons) when considered together, 211 (213) and \u2212211 (\u2212213). This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 25a. Similarly, in a theory with N fD = 3 there is an octet and a singlet, or 3 diagonal and 6 off-diagonal dark mesons. In the current pythia 8 release there are also only 3 PIDs for these 9 dark pions (and 3 PIDs for 9 \u03c1D mesons), following the same logic as for N fD = 2. The ratio of diagonal to off-diagonal dark mesons is now 1:2 so pythia creates twice as many off-diagonal dark mesons as diagonal ones. In this situation, 111 (113) is only half as likely as 211 (213) and \u2212211 (\u2212213) together, see Fig. 25b.\nThe pythia 8.307 includes individual PIDs for all the multiplets and singlets, as well as a new parameter called HiddenValley:probKeepEta1, which determines the probability to create the singlet state. This probability is set relative to the probability of producing spin-0 multiplets. The default setting is 1, but it can be set to 0 such that the singlet is not produced at all.\nThe handling of dark PIDs affects the expected value of rinv. In pythia 8.245 release it is not possible to turn off the production of the singlet state and so this must be taken into account in the calculation of rinv. Take as an example an N fD = 2 model with diagonal \u03c1D mesons (113) promptly decaying to the SM through a vector portal. Firstly, the probVec = 0.75 parameter dictates that 3/4 of the dark mesons will be \u03c1D mesons, of which half are diagonal. This means that 3/8 of the dark mesons will be unstable, while the remaining 3/8 off-diagonal \u03c1D mesons and 1/4 dark pions are stable, resulting in a ratio of stable dark mesons to all dark mesons of 5/8 or 0.625. The value of rinv can be calculated at the generator level by counting separately final-state, stable dark mesons and all dark mesons (including decayed \u03c1D mesons) in the event and taking the ratio of these two sums. The distribution of rinv for such a model with FV splitting turned off can be seen in Fig. 26.\nPYTHIA full n-plate implementation The validation of the new pythia HV module was performed through a phenomenological analysis of the distinct variables obtained for three different cases: HV module in pythia 8.245 and in pythia 8.307 with either HiddenValley:SeparateFlav = off or Hidden Valley:SeparateFlav = on. All dark mesons were set to be stable. The distributions of angular and kinematic variables of the different final state particles were compared for those three cases. Although the most important variables are related to the dark pion and \u03c1D mesons, the missing transverse energy and the produced jets were also considered for this validation study. The reconstruction of the jets is done by clustering the generator level objects obtained after parton-shower and hadronization, using the radius parameter R = 1.4. As the dark mesons are set to be stable, the jets we study in this section are therefore not a result of hadronization in the dark sector. They originate e.g. from initial state radiation and subsequent hadronization in the SM sector. As mentioned before, the validation of the pythia 8.307 HV module is executed for two specific models: N fD = 3 and N fD = 8 (with NcD = 3 for both). For simplicity, only the results from the pp analysis are shown, as the same conclusions were obtained for the e+e\u2212 study.\nNcD = 3, N fD = 3 model Changing the N fD value from 2 to 3 results in additional PIDs being produced, as can be seen by comparing the dark pions and \u03c1D mesons particle ID shown in Fig. 27a, b, respectively, to the ones shown in Fig. 25a, b. One can see that dark pions and \u03c1D with ID 311 (313) and \u2212311 (\u2212313) are produced when setting N fD to 3 and HiddenValley:SeparateFlav = on. For the case where HiddenValley:SeparateFlav = on in particular, a total of 9 pseudo-scalar and 9 vector particles are identified, with the same production rates for all states in a given multiplet. The distributions of the multiplicity and the transverse momentum of the dark hadrons are repre-\nsented in Fig. 28a, b. A lower multiplicity of these dark hadrons and a softer transverse momentum can be seen for the HiddenValley:SeparateFlav = on scenario compared with pythia 8.245. These changes are expected with the new HV module due to the bug fix related to the newly implemented pT suppression for mini-string fragmentation, as discussed in Sect. 4.1.4. An overall agreement can be found for the HiddenValley:separateFlav = on and HiddenValley:separateFlav = off with the new HV module. Concerning the specific case of the dark pions, the corresponding multiplicity and transverse momentum can be found in Fig. 29a, b. With similar conclusions as for the dark pions, the distributions of the same variables corresponding to the \u03c1D mesons are shown in Fig. 30a, b. From Figs. 29a and 30a, it can be concluded that the pseudo-scalars have lower multiplicity with respect to vector mesons. The difference between the distributions for\nthe diagonal and off-diagonal dark pions and \u03c1D mesons was studied. The multiplicity and the transverse momentum of the diagonal and off-diagonal dark hadrons were consistent with the previous conclusions, with an agreement between the new and old HV modules with the different HiddenValley:separateFlav options. For completeness, the distributions of the missing transverse energy and the minimum azimuthal angle between jets and missing transverse energy can also be found in Fig. 31a, b. The latter shows that the missing transverse energy is recoiling against jets, as expected in the fully invisible scenario investigated here. The use of the new HV module does not have any impact on the event kinematics, as expected.\nNcD = 3, N fD = 8 model Setting N fD = 8 brings a whole new set of PIDs both for dark pions and \u03c1D mesons, as confirmed in Fig. 32a, b. For the case with HiddenValley:separateFlav = on, additional PIDs from 311 (313) and \u2212311 (\u2212313) to 811 (813) and \u2212811 (\u2212813) are produced with a total of 64 dark pions or \u03c1D mesons, with the same production rate for all states in each multiplet. The multiplicity and transverse momentum of the dark pions are shown in Fig. 33a, b and similarly, for the \u03c1D mesons in Fig. 34a, b. In agreement with the previous model analyzed, a lower multiplicity and a softer transverse momentum of the dark hadrons are observed with the new pythia 8 HV module. The same conclusions stand when looking at diagonal and off-diagonal dark pions and \u03c1D mesons separately. The missing transverse energy and the minimum azimuthal angle between jets and missing transverse energy can be found in Fig. 35a, b. Once again, these distributions agree for the three cases considered.\nThrough this validation, we thus highlight some of the differences between pythia 8.245 and pythia 8.307 hidden valley module. We also demonstrate that switching HiddenValley:SeparateFlav = on or off does not\nlead to physics differences in the production rates or kinematics of the events, but allows to access additional meson PIDs whose masses and branching ratios can be manipulated according to theory predictions.\n4.3 Phenomenological studies of jet substructure observables\nContributors:CesareCazzaniga, FlorianEble, AranGarciaBellido, Nicoline Hemme, Nukulsinh Parmar\nIn this section we exemplify the kinematic distributions resulting from benchmarks proposed in Sect. 4.1, focusing on the benchmark with D = 10 GeV and N fD = 3, and belonging to the regime m\u03c0D < m\u03c1D/2 for which the \u03c1D \u2192 \u03c0D\u03c0D decay mode is open. The mass of Z\u2032 boson is set to 1 TeV. We then consider either 1, 2 or 3 diagonal pions decaying to SM particles. The \u03c0D mesons decay to cc as this is the heaviest allowed fermion pair. We simulate this signal using pythia8.307 with HiddenValley:separateFlav = off and pass it through DELHPES3 using the HL-LHC card. Jets are clustered using FastJet [196,197] using anti-kt algorithm [198]. We produce 50k events for the distributions shown in Sect. 4.3.1, and 500k events for those shown in Sect. 4.3.2."

As expected, the 1-\u03c0D decay model has a an average rinv of 89 as all \u03c1D mesons decay to \u03c0D and only 1 of the 9 \u03c0D is unstable. The 2-\u03c0D decays has a mean of rinv 79 and for the 3-\u03c0D, a mean of rinv 23 is obtained.\nIn Fig. 37, some basic kinematic variable distributions are compared for the 3 dark pion decay models. These generatorlevel distributions are computed with jets of radius R = 0.4 and pT > 25 GeV. The pT distribution in Fig. 37a shows that more dark pion decays result in a higher average lead jet pT, as expected when more dark particles decay to SM particles that can be detected. The ET distribution shown in Fig. 37b reveals very similar values between the 3 different models, which may seem contrary to what one would expect, i.e. more SM-decaying pions might be expected to result in lower ET; however, while more stable dark pions truly gives higher missing or invisible energy in the system, the additional invisible particles may be evenly distributed between the two back-to-back jets and therefore not appear in the detector as additional ET.\nFigure 37c shows the distributions of the transverse mass, MT, of the leading and sub-leading jet and the ET. As can be seen, having more SM-decaying dark pions generally yields a\nhigher transverse mass. As the ET remains relatively stable but the jet pT increases with the number of unstable dark pions, this results in higher MT values."

            "text": "Experimental searches and phenomenological studies for dark showers exploit jet substructure (JSS) observables to tag jets as dark jets [72,74,91,199,200]. Comparisons of jet suCohen:2020afvbstructure variables of interest, between the former and the new Hidden Valley pythia modules, between different dark vector meson production probabilities, and between different number of unstable dark pions \u03c0D, are presented in this section. In the pythia 8 Hidden Valley module [201,202] the probability to produce a dark vector meson can be changed by setting the parameter HiddenValley:probVector. There is no precise theoretical prediction for the fraction of dark vector mesons produced after string fragmentation in the hidden sector. Assuming a mass degeneracy between vector and pseudo-scalar states, it is reasonable to fixHiddenValley:probVector = 0.75 as pseudo-scalars have 1 degree of freedom while vector mesons have 3 degrees of freedom. However, generically the \u03c1D mesons and dark pions are not mass degenerate, hence the production rate of pseudo-scalars is enhanced compared to mass-degenerate scenarios due to the larger phase space available for lighter states. In this specific case, a reasonable value is HiddenValley:probVector = 0.5, very much like in QCD.\nFor this study, generator-level jets have been clustered with the inclusive anti-kt algorithm [198], choosing a cone size R = 0.8 and a minimum pT of 200 GeV. Jets were clus-\ntered from all visible SM particles and jet constituents were used for computing the jet substructure. The JSS observables studied here are the generalized angularities \u03bb\u03ba\u03b2 , the N -subjettiness [203] \u03c4N and jet major and minor axes.\nGeneralized angularities are presented in Fig. 38 and are defined from the constituents i \u2208 {1, . . . , N } carrying momentum fraction zi inside a jet of cone size R as:\n\u03bb\u03ba\u03b2 = \u2211\ni\u2208 jet z\u03bai\n( Ri, jet\nR\n)\u03b2 . (20)\nN -subjettiness \u03c4\u03b2N are designed to count the number of subjets inside a jet. In specific, N -subjettiness is defined as:\n\u03c4 \u03b2 N =\n\u2211\ni\npT,imin(R \u03b2 1,i , R \u03b2 2,i , R \u03b2 3,i , . . . , R \u03b2 N ,i ) (21)\nwhere the sum is over the jet constituents, and R\u03b2N ,i is the distance between the N th subjet and the i th constituent of the jet. \u03c4\n\u03b2 N measures departure from N-parton energy flow: if a jet has N subjets, \u03c4\u03b2N\u22121 should be much larger than \u03c4 \u03b2 N . Originally, \u03c4 \u03b2 N have been introduced in order to identify hadronicallydecaying boosted objects and reject QCD background. In those studies, the angular parameter \u03b2 has been fixed to 1 as done in previous studies for boosted objects discrimination [204].\nThe shape of the jet can be approximated by an ellipse in the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 plane. The major and minor axes are the two principal components of this ellipse and are defined from the following symmetric matrix M :\nM = ( \u2211 i p 2 T,i \u03b7 2 i \u2212 \u2211 i p 2 T,i \u03b7i \u03c6i\n\u2212\u2211i p2T,i \u03b7i \u03c6i \u2211 i p 2 T,i \u03c6 2 i\n) (22)\nwhere the sum runs over all constituents of the jet and \u03b7, \u03c6 are the differences in \u03b7 and \u03c6 with respect to the jet axis. The major and minor axes are defined from the eigenvalues \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 of M as:\n\u03c3minor,major = \u221a\n\u03bb1,2\u2211 i p 2 T,i\n(23)\nGeneralized angularities belong to the category of jet shape variables and they have been originally built to measure the quantity of radiation inside a jet in order to discriminate between jets initiated by quarks and those initiated by gluons [205,206]. Indeed, for the gluon jets the values of the generalized angularities are usually expected to be larger since gluons are expected to radiate more due to the larger color factor. In the same way, these observables have been used in analyses to discriminate between SM jets and dark jets [98]. In particular, the dark jets are expected to be wider\nthan SM jets due to the double hadronization process and the mass splitting between the dark bound states and the SM quarks.\nWe first start by comparing JSS observables between the old and new pythia Hidden Valley modules. Comparison of quark-gluon discriminant variables and N -subjettiness variables are shown in Figs. 39 and 40. Some systematic differences are observed for the jet transverse momentum dispersion pTD, due to the different number and different pT spectrum of the dark mesons \u03c0D and \u03c1D in the new pythia Hidden Valley module. N -subjettiness are smaller with the new module when decreasing rinv and looking for high number of subjets. No large systematic difference is observed for the other substructure variables.\nNext, we studied the differences in the JSS observables between two dark vector meson production fractions: 50% and 75%. Comparison of quark-gluon discriminant variables, N -subjettiness and number of constituents are shown in Figs. 41, 42 and 43. Some systematic differences are observed for all variables. It is clear that the number of constituents in jets is lower for higher vector meson fraction. Jets with large number of soft constituents are characterized by low pTD while pTD is higher for jets where just a few constituents carry most of the momentum. The fact that pTD is higher for higher vector dark meson fractions is certainly an effect of the lower number of constituents. Jet girth, axes and N -subjettiness are all smaller in the case of probVector=0.75 compared toprobVector=0.5. This indicates that jets are narrower since with larger values of vector mesons fraction we observe a harder pT spectrum for the dark hadrons decaying visibly.\nWe then studied how the number of unstable diagonal \u03c0D mesons affects the jet substructure. Plots of quark-gluon discriminant, number of constituents and photon energy fraction for different number of unstable diagonal dark pions are provided in Fig. 44. Multiplicity is higher for lower rinv, which is expected as the multiplicity is directly related to the number of unstable dark pions. Major and minor axes as well as girth are higher for lower rinv, suggesting that the jet is wider.\nIn conclusion, we have noticed that the variation of the hidden sector parameters such asprobVector can impact JSS distributions at generator level leading to a harder spectrum for the dark hadrons and consequently narrower jets. Notably, only two benchmark points for the vector meson fraction have been investigated, and further studies are encouraged to understand better the impact of the parameters of the hidden sector on the observable JSS distributions."

            "text": "Traditional calculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics are based on an order-by-order expansion in the strong coupling \u03b1s . Observables that are calculable in this\nway are known as \u201csafe\u201d [207]. As it is well-known, divergences of different nature can appear in the perturbative series. For the ultraviolet divergences appearing in loop diagrams, since QCD is a renormalisable theory, such infinities can be consistently cured. Moreover, real-emission diagrams exhibit singularities in particular corners of the phase-space. More specifically, the singular contributions have to do with collinear splittings of massless partons and emissions of soft gluons off both massless and massive particles. Virtual diagrams also exhibit analogous infra-red and collinear (IRC) singularities and theorems [208\u2013210] assure that such infinities cancel at each order of the perturbative series, when real and virtual corrections are added together, thus leading to physical transition probabilities that are free of IRC singularities. An observable O({pi }) calculated from a system of particles with momenta pi is defined to be infrared safe if adding a soft particle with momentum the following relation holds:\nO({pi }) = lim \u21920O( , {pi }). (24)\nInstead, if we consider a particle p1 splitting into 2 particles p1 \u2192 p(a)1 + p(b)1 with angle between them \u03b81,ab \u2192 0, the observable O({pi }) is said to be collinear safe if:\nO({pi }) = lim \u03b81,ab\u21920 O(p(a)1 , p(b)1 , {pi }). (25)\nTo check IRC safety of JSS observables, we computed them at different stages of the shower/hadronization going from the dark sector to the SM sector. For IRC unsafe observables, large fluctuations in the showering process are expected, while IRC safe observables should be more stable during the evolution. Therefore for collinear splittings or soft emissions happening during the parton shower, the IRC unsafe observables will tend to diverge from the original value calculated in previous stages of the showering. Due to this feature, the IRC unsafe observables if not validated on data can introduce important model dependence in analyses exploiting them in supervised classifiers . This is particularly relevant in the case of dark shower studies where the MCdata agreement for signal cannot be assessed, and therefore there is no real control on IRC unsafe observables due to the unknown details of the hidden sector (for example the dark hadronization scale D). Specifically, given an observable O({pi }), changes in the Hidden sector parameters such as D are expected to produce a power law scaling for IRC safe observables given the jet pt pT j : \u3008\u03b4Osa f e\u3009 \u223c ( D/pT j )\u03b1 . On the other hand, the scaling is logarithmic in the case of IRC unsafe observables: \u3008\u03b4Ounsa f e\u3009 \u223c log( D/pT j ). This means that depending on the hadronization scale of the dark sector, the IRC unsafe observables can undergo large fluctuations for D pT, which means that without knowing\nD these observables are correctly described by the parton shower but are also dependent of the details of the hidden sector. In this study we test IRC safety of JSS observables by calculating them at 3 levels in the evolution of the shower: dark sector hadrons, SM quarks and SM hadrons. As previously mentioned, we expect the IRC safe observables to fluctuate less in the evolution. For the test we consider two generalized angularities, namely pTD which is an IRC unsafe\nobservable, and the jet girth, which is IRC safe. The collinear unsafety of pTD is due to its dependence on the squared of the transverse momenta of the jet constituents. Therefore, taking a particle with transverse momentum p1,T, if the particle splits into 2 particles with transverse momenta p(a)1,T and p(b)1,T, pTD becomes:\n(pTD) 2 \u221d (p1,T)2 = (p(a)1,T)2 + (p(b)1,T)2 + p(a)1,T p(b)1,Tcos(\u03b812). (26)\nTherefore, we expect pTD to fluctuate more during the showering compared to the jet girth. Our results for the test of IRC safety for JSS observables is presented in Fig. 45. The plots show the following ratios for the tested JSS observable: unstable dark hadrons vs SM quarks, SM quarks vs SM hadrons and unstable dark hadrons vs SM hadrons. We expect the distributions of the ratios for the collinear unsafe observable calculated at different steps of the shower to differ from unity. For a fair comparison between the same observable calculated at different stages of the showering we consider only jets with a multiplicity of SM quarks which is twice the dark hadrons one. Moreover, because the girth of jets with one constituent is a special case as girth is close to 0, we consider only jets with a number of unstable dark hadrons strictly larger than one. The main result of this study is that even if IRC unsafe observables are expected to be described quite well by the parton shower, the application of IRC unsafe observables in the context of dark shower searches should be carefully validated in control regions by comparing MonteCarlo and data. Secondly, as the dark hadronization scale is unknown, the effect of changing D on JSS observables must be evaluated. The usage of such variables especially in Hidden Valley searches can lead to important limitations in terms of interpretability of the results due to their strong dependence on the unknowns of the Hidden sector."

These techniques may involve new kinematic variables, jet substructure information (as briefly discussed in Sect. 4.3), machine learning, or advanced triggering strategies. In this section,\nwe illustrate some the avenues which have been explored in the literature, using the dark/hidden sector parametrizations presented in Sect. 2.2. It would be of great interest to also perform such analyses in the light of the new developments presented in Sect. 4.1.\n5.1 Event-level variables\nContributors: Hugues Beauchesne, Giovanni Grilli di Cortona\nSemi-visible jets are a characteristic signature of many confining dark sectors and consist of jets of visible hadrons intermixed with invisible stable particles. Up to now, two main search strategies have been pursued: tagging semivisible jets (see e.g. Refs. [72\u201374,199,200,211\u2013213]) and exploiting the special relation between the azimuthal direction of the semi-visible jets and the missing transverse momentum ET (see e.g. Refs. [2,63,214]). In Ref. [215], it was shown that these two approaches can be combined to define new event-level variables that considerably increase the sensitivity of semi-visible jet searches. The central idea is that semi-visible jets are responsible for most of ET in signals and that tagging specifies which jets are semi-visible. The tagging information then predicts the direction and magnitude of ET, which can be compared to its measurement. In this section, we present a summary of Ref. [215] and refer to it for technical details.\nFor illustration purposes, consider the following benchmark model. Assume a new confining group G. Introduce a dark quark qD that is a fundamental of G and neutral under the Standard Model gauge groups. Introduce a scalar mediator S that is an antifundamental of G and has an hypercharge of \u22121. These fields allow the Lagrangian\nL = \u03bbi S\u2020qDPREi + h.c., (27)\nwhere Ei are the Standard Model leptons. Assume for simplicity that the only non-negligible \u03bbi is the one corresponding to the electron. If the mediators are pair-produced, they will each decay to an electron and a dark quark. The experimental signature will then be two electrons and two semivisible jets. This is similar to the signature of leptoquark pair-production and as such preselection cuts are applied based on typical leptoquark cuts. The event is also required to contain two jets tagged as semi-visible. We focus on the tt\nbackground. Events are generated usingMadGraph5 [216], pythia 8 [217] and Delphes 3 [218]. The Hidden Valley module of pythia is used with the following parameters:\nSetting Value Setting Value\nNGauge 3 Dark pion mass 10 GeV\nnFlav 1 Dark rho mass 21 GeV\nFSR On pTminFSR 11 GeV\nalphaOrder 1 fragment On\nLambda 10 GeV probVec 0.75\nDark quark mass 10 GeV\nAll other parameters are left to their default value. Finally, we define 1 \u2212 rinv as the average fraction of the dark pions that decay back to Standard Model particles.\nConsider a signal event. Label the transverse momenta of the two dark quarks produced from the decay of the two S as pqDiT , with i \u2208 {1, 2}. Each qD leads to a visible jet of transverse momentum pDiT \u223c (1 \u2212 rinv)pqDiT and a contribution to ET of \u223c rinvpqDiT . This gives\nET \u223c rinv1 \u2212 rinv p D1 T + rinv 1 \u2212 rinv p D2 T . (28)\nConsider the decomposition ET = a1pD1T +a2pD2T . The coefficients a1 and a2 should then peak at \u223c rinv/(1 \u2212 rinv) and can be combined in a single test statistics. This could be done in multiple ways, but a simple and powerful one is to train a fully supervised neural network on the a1 and a2 of both the signal and the background. Alternatively, one can encode much of the same reasoning in a single variable. Define\n\u03c6 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c6pDT \u2212 \u03c6 ET \u2223\u2223\u2223 , (29)\nwhere \u03c6pDT (\u03c6 ET ) is the azimuthal angle of pD1T + pD2T ( ET). This quantity should peak at 0 for the signal, but unfortunately contains no information on the norm of ET. We introduce two comparisons. First, the standard procedure up to now has been to compute the minimal difference in azimuthal angle between ET and the leading jets [63]\n\u03c6CLLM = min i\u22644 {\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u03c6p jiT \u2212 \u03c6 ET \u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223 } , (30)\nwhere in this case four jets are considered. Second, we consider a supervised neural network using x = {\u03c6pD1 , \u03c6pD2 , \u03b7pD1 , \u03b7pD2 , \u03c6 ET\n}. This is only meant as a comparison, as fully supervised neural network are susceptible to simulation artefacts and sculpting.\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are shown in Fig. 50 for different values of rinv. As can be seen, the\ncoefficients a1 and a2 typically provide the strongest results. They sometimes exceed the fully supervised neural network by exploiting information on the magnitude of the momenta which are not provided to the neural network. The coefficients outperform the standard approach of \u03c6CLLM by an order of magnitude for a signal rejection rate of 0.5. The variable \u03c6 also generally outperforms \u03c6CLLM.\n5.2 Casting a graph net to catch dark showers\nContributors: Elias Bernreuther To increase the sensitivity to dark shower signals consisting of promptly decaying dark hadrons, it is crucial to reduce the large QCD background. While backgrounds from mismeasured QCD jets mimic the signal with regards to eventlevel observables, such as \u03c6, differences are expected at the level of jet substructure. These can arise from differences in the shower evolution between QCD and the dark sector, the presence of visibly decaying heavy dark mesons in the jets, or invisible dark hadrons that are interspersed with visible particles. See e.g. Refs. [74,200] for recent studies of dark shower signals in terms of classic jet substructure variables. In contrast, advances in tagging jets with modern machine learning techniques make use of low-level properties of jet constituents. Here, we summarize the results of Ref. [73], which studies the potential of deep neural networks for identifying semi-visible jets from dark showers.\nAs a benchmark, dark showers of nearly mass-degenerate GeV-scale dark mesons which are produced at the LHC via a heavy Z\u2032 vector mediator with mass on the TeV scale were considered. The underlying dark sector is the Aachen model summarized in Sect. 2.2.6 and motivated by cosmological and experimental constraints [61]. The dark quark production process pp \u2192 qDqD was simulated with MadGraph5 2.6.4 [216] using a UFO file generated with FeynRules [219] and performing MLM matching with up to one additional hard jet. Showering and hadronization, both in QCD and in the hidden sector, were carried out using pythia 8.240 [46,47,220]. The settings used in pythia\u2019s Hidden Valley module for a signal with dark meson mass mD are summarized in Table 5. The parameter probVector was set to 0.5 such that 25% of dark mesons are unstable, flavor-diagonal vector mesons as predicted by the benchmark model. Jet clustering is performed by FastJet [196] using the anti-kT algorithm with jet radius R = 0.8.\nA priori, it is not clear what the optimal jet representation and neural network architecture are to optimally distinguish dark shower jets from QCD jets. In Ref. [73] it was shown that a dynamic graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN) [221,222] operating on particle clouds outperforms convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on jet images [223] and a network operating on ordered lists of Lorentz vectors [224]. While a standard CNN carries out con-\nvolutions over neighboring pixels in a jet image, a DGCNN performs convolutions over edges of a graph constructed from jet constituents that are neighbors in feature space. While graph networks also represent the state of the art in tagging boosted top jets [225], their advantage over a CNN or a Lorentz Layer network is considerably larger in identifying semi-visible jets. A comparison of ROC curves showing the QCD jet background rejection 1/ B as a function of the dark shower signal efficiency S for mD = 5 GeV is shown in Fig. 51.\nSince the parameters of the dark sector are a priori unknown it is a crucial question how well the classification performance of the DGCNN generalizes to dark showers with different parameter values than were used for training. Varying rinv and mD, the performance continuously degrades the further the parameters of the dark showers in the test sample are from those in the training sample. While the effect is modest for rinv, it is much more substantial for the dark meson mass. For example, for a network trained with mD = 5 GeV, the background rejection rate for signal efficiencies between 0.1 and 0.3 is reduced by nearly an order of magnitude when tested on samples with mD = 20 GeV. This suggests that the network learns to reconstruct this mass from the jet constituents. Importantly, this behavior can be mitigated by training the network on mixed samples which contain jets with a range of different dark meson masses. This yields a much\nmore general classifier as reflected in the ROC curves in Fig. 51.\nFinally, it was investigated how much the sensitivity of an experimental search for dark showers can be improved by applying a DGCNN as a semi-visible jet tagger. As an example, an ATLAS search for mono-jet events with a luminosity of 36.1 fb\u22121 [226] was considered, which is sensitive to signal events where one of the two dark showers remains invisible and, thus, \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c0 . For an event to be accepted, it had to fulfil the original selection criteria of the search and contain at least one fat jet that is classified as a semi-visible jet by the network. The training sample consisted of jets from a dark shower signal with the benchmark parameters stated in Sect. 2.2.6 and from the dominant Z+jets background. The expected number of background events with and without the DGCNN tagger is shown in Table 6 for the signal region EM4, which is the region most sensitive to the signal when mZ\u2032 = 1 TeV. In addition, the table compares the resulting expected 95% CL limit S95exp on the number of signal events in the region with and without the tagger and shows the corresponding improvement of the projected limit on the dark quark production cross section. In the benchmark scenario shown in Table 6 a DGCNN for tagging semi-visible jets can improve the sensitivity of the search to dark showers by more than one order of magnitude.\n5.3 Autoencoders for semi-visible jets\nContributors: Annapaola de Cosa, Jeremi Niedziela, Kevin Pedro\nSemi-visible jets arise from Hidden Valley models of dark matter, which include strong interaction in the dark sector. They constitute a challenging experimental signature in which a fraction of jet constituents is invisible to the detector, leading to missing transverse energy ET being aligned with the jet.\nThe details of the kinematics are mainly affected by the following theory parameters: mZ\u2032 (the mass of the mediator), mD (the mass of the dark hadrons) and rinv (the fraction of stable, invisible dark hadrons). However, a large total number of unknown theory parameters leads to a vast model space with a huge number of possible scenarios that can easily evade any constraints from e.g. cosmological measurements. Since it is impractical to perform dedicated searches for all possible model variations, we propose to use autoencoders (AE) as anomalous jets taggers instead [199].\nThe autoencoder-based anomaly detection strategy is robust against both detector effects and details of the model implementation. AEs are designed to detect objects significantly different from the training sample, without prior knowledge of signal characteristics. For reference, the AE introduced here is compared to a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) trained on the QCD background and a mixture of different signals. For completeness, we have also studied alternative anomaly detection techniques, namely Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\nAll architectures mentioned above were trained on highlevel properties of jets: \u03b7 and \u03c6 coordinates and invariant mass m j , as well as jet substructure variables: jet pT dispersion pTD, jet ellipse minor and major axes, EFP1, and ECF ratios: C2 and D2. We have also considered including fourmomenta of jet constituents in the training, but they were ultimately discarded since no improvement was observed.\nThe performance of different approaches is quantified by comparing the area under the ROC (receiver operator characteristic) curve (AUC), shown in Fig. 52. It was demonstrated that an AE-based jet tagger can provide satisfactory performance, compared with the fully supervised BDT approach. The PCA proved to be less efficient than other approaches. The VAE was found give the best results when trained exclusively on reconstruction loss, leading its variance to collapse to zero and therefore becoming equivalent to a regular AE.\nRobustness against unknown model parameters was also assessed. As shown in the rightmost panel of Fig. 52 and in Fig. 53, in certain cases the AE can outperform the BDT when the latter was trained on an incorrect signal hypothesis. Another interesting observation that can be made in the right panel of Fig. 52 is that a BDT trained on rinv = 0.3 and tested\non rinv = 0.7 performs better then the one trained on a mixture of different signals (left panel). This is caused by the fact that the low rinv signal is more similar to the background, and\ntherefore the BDT has to learn how to distinguish between the two more precisely. This results in a performance boost when tested on an easier case of large rinv.\n5.4 Autoencoders for SUEP\nContributors: JaredBarron,DavidCurtin,GregorKasieczka, Tilman Plehn, Aris G.B.

Strategies to overcome the experimental challenges of searches for SUEP at the LHC are still being developed. For the nightmare scenario of prompt, hadronically decaying SUEP, a search strategy was proposed in [159], employing an autoencoder neural network as an anomaly detector.\nAn autoencoder is an unsupervised neural network trained on background events, which attempts to minimize the difference between its output and input. Ideally the autoencoder learns to do this efficiently only for inputs that are similar to its training data, so that when evaluated on an event from outside the background distribution, a high reconstruction error flags the event as anomalous. In the case of a search for\nSUEP, the background events are soft, highly isotropic QCD events. The unsupervised nature of this analysis avoids the model dependence that comes from using signal simulation to develop a classifier."

For this purpose, SUEP events were generated using a statistical toy model of the dark shower.\nThe highly isotropic hadronic SUEP toy model simulated events were generated beginning with the production of Higgs bosons in association with a W or Z boson, simulated at center-of-mass energy 14 TeV in pythia 8 [220]. The vector boson was then required to decay leptonically. The hard lepton(s) from the vector boson decay were used to sidestep the issue of how to trigger on SUEP for this analysis. The decay of the Higgs to a shower of dark mesons was performed with the SUEP_Generator plugin in pythia 8.243, which models the dark shower as being a completely isotropic cloud with Boltzmann-distributed momenta as was presented in Eq. 10, and for which the parameter TD controls the energy distribution of the dark mesons, and represents the Hagedorn temperature of the dark sector. Only one flavor of dark meson is assumed, with mass mD. Each dark meson was then forced to decay hadronically to a uu quark pair. From this point the parton showering and hadronization were performed by pythia as normal. Signal simulation was generated for mD from 0.4 to 8 GeV, and for TD/mD from 0.25 to 4. Detector simulation was performed with Delphes 3 with CMS detector settings [218]. Due to the difficulty of disentangling the highly diffuse energy depositions of SUEP from pile-up, only charged track information was used for the analysis."

Before feeding events into the autoencoder as training data, 98% of the initial simulated background events were discarded by cutting on three highlevel observables that encode the essential features of SUEP.\nFirst, the multiplicity of charged tracks was required to be Ncharged \u2265 70. Second, the event ring isotropy variable introduced in [146], measuring the Wasserstein distance between a given event and a uniformly isotropic distribution of energy, was required to be I < 0.07.

Using the reconstruction loss as an anomaly score, ROC curves were constructed for each parameter point. To estimate the physical sensitivity of the model, the minimal excludable branching ratio of Higgs to SUEP for which S/ \u221a B + usys B2 > 2 was computed. Statistical uncertainties due to the limited size of the simulated background sample became dominant as the cut threshold was increased before the classifier\u2019s performance began to deteriorate, indicating that the sensitivity of a real search using this method could be even higher than we report here.\nAs Fig. 54 illustrates, this autoencoder-based analysis could exclude Higgs branching ratios to SUEP down to 1% for dark meson mass mD < 1 GeV and TD/mD < 1. If the dark shower temperature TD is < 0.5mD, branching ratios down to 5% could be probed for mD up to \u2248 8 GeV.\nUsing a neural network architecture and event representation tailored to the essential characteristics of the SUEP signature, but without relying on the details of any signal simulation model, this study demonstrates that even the maximally challenging scenario of entirely prompt and hadronic SUEP can be probed at the HL-LHC.\n5.5 Triggering on emerging jets\nContributors: Daniel Stolarski The original Emerging Jets (EJ) theory paper [1] as well as the CMS search [88] (see also Sect. 2.1.2 of this white paper) considers a model with a colored mediator that is pair produced at the LHC, which leads to a final state with two QCD jets and two EJs. Those works also consider mediator masses in the regime of m 600 GeV. Given those assumptions, the vast majority of EJ events have substantial HT and thus the trigger efficiency is very high. In this section we consider relaxing both of the above assumptions and explore how one can still trigger on Emerging Jets.\nIn [228], an s-channel mediator was considered (see also Sect. 2.1.1 of this report), focusing on a Z\u2032 that couples to the quark current in the SM and the dark quark current. Such a mediator produces events that typically do not include additional hard jets. That work also considered the possibility of relatively light Z\u2032 down to masses of \u223c 50 GeV. The typical HT of such events, particularly in the light Z\u2032 regime, is considerably lower than typical trigger thresholds at the LHC experiments, and other techniques are needed to increase the trigger efficiency.\nThe events were generated using a modified spin-1 mediator model12 [63] implemented using the FeynRules [219] package. The hard process is generated with Madgraph 5_aMC@NLO [216] using a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV. This output is interfaced to the Hidden Valley [46,47] module of pythia 8 [220], which simulates showering and hadronization in the dark sector as well as decays of dark hadrons to either other dark hadrons or to SM states. The Z\u2032 mass is varied and a Z\u2032 width of Z\u2032 = mZ\u2032/100 is used.\n12 https://github.com/smsharma/SemivisibleJets.\nThe remaining dark sector parameters are varied across a few benchmark models shown in Table I of [228].\nInitial state radiation (ISR) in QCD or EW is included at leading order in the hard processes. The resulting hadrons are clustered into jets using the Anti-kt algorithm [229] implemented in FASTJET [196] with a jet angular parameter R = 0.4 and a maximum pseudorapidity of |\u03b7| < 2.49 to be compatible with the ATLAS inner tracker. MLM matching and merging procedure [230] is employed for extra QCD radiation withXQCutofmZ\u2032 /10. A crude detector volume cut is implemented at the pythia 8 stage for which particles that are outside of a cylinder of (r = 3000 mm, z = 3000 mm) are considered stable.\nTwo main strategies are explored to increase the trigger efficiency. The first is exploiting the possibility of SM radiation from the initial state. While electroweak (W/Z/\u03b3 ) radiation was explored, the most effective strategy was to use additional QCD radiation. This radiation can increase the trigger efficiency in two complimentary ways. First, the additional hard jet(s) can be used to trigger on directly. Second, the emerging jets tend to be boosted and carry more energy. This in turn will increase the HT ( ET) if the dark pion states are short (long) lived.\nUsing ATLAS trigger thresholds from [231], we estimate the improvement in rate achieved by including radiation and the results are shown in Fig. 55. In addition to increasing the trigger efficiency, events with extra radiation have reduced rates, therefore Fig. 55 shows the ratio of the cross section times trigger efficiency for events with radiation to those without. We see that the largest improvement is additional radiation of two extra jets (green line). The left panel is a benchmark with a dark pion lifetime of 150 mm (Model A) and uses the missing energy trigger. We see that for a light Z\u2032, more than an order of magnitude improvement in rate is possible. The right side is a model with a dark pion lifetime of 5 mm (Model B) and uses the HT trigger. In that benchmark, the efficiency of the leading order process is below what was simulated for mZ\u2032 350 GeV, and the improvement is potentially even larger.\nThe first method considered above uses existing triggers, but [228] also considers implementing new triggers using modern machine learning techniques. As ISR is no longer relevant, pythia8\u2019s hidden valley production process f f \u2192 Z\u2032 processes is employed to generate events. Regardless of the lifetime of the dark pions, the detector subsystem with the largest number of decays is the inner tracker. Therefore, the strategy employed (which is also similar to that of [232] proposed for b-tagging), is to use the tracker information but not reconstruct tracks. Rather [228] proposes to use hit patterns in different layers of the tracker as an input to a support vector machine13 (SVM) from the TMVA toolkit [233]. A\n13 Other machine learning techniques gave similar results.\ndark pion lifetime of 5 mm. The dotted line is the leading order process. On the right plot, the blue region on the left has zero of events that we simulated pass the trigger and thus an efficiency min = 1/400,000\nproper detector simulation of the inner tracker is outside of the scope, but a crude detector simulation with code used in [9] which encompasses the ATLAS tracker from the Inner B-layer (IBL) to the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). This detector simulation assumes simple models of energy loss through each thin layer of the detector.\nWhen proposing new triggers, backgrounds must also be considered, and the main background for this strategy is bb jets as they have a very large rate and also produce displaced hadrons. Simulations are performed using gg \u2192 bb with pythia 8\u2019s heavy flavor hard bb processes. The inclusive background cross section is taken from the pythia 8. Pileup is added to both signal and background events with pythia 8\u2019s minimum bias events. For each signal or background event, a number of minimum bias events are added randomly sampled from a poisson distribution with mean of \u03bc = 50, mimicking the Run 2 conditions.\nThe left panel of Fig. 56 shows the ability of the SVM to distinguish signal in blue from the dominant bb background. On the right panel we show the ROC curve as a function of lifetime. A background rejection of \u223c 10\u22122\u221210\u22123 is needed for a novel high level trigger, and we see that efficiencies of O(10%) are achievable, with larger efficiencies at lower dark pions lifetimes. It is also found that using an SVM trained on one signal benchmark can also give good acceptance for other signal benchmarks, showing great promise for such a new trigger."

            "text": "In this report, we have summarised the work performed in the context of the Dark Shower Snowmass project: it is the first\ncomprehensive effort to gather the large, pre-existing theoretical, phenomenological and experimental communities working in this field, following initial discussions in the LHC Long-lived Particles Working Group [234] and also some presentations in the LHC Dark Matter Working Group. This report also concretely describes pathways for a systematic exploration of strongly interacting theories. In this context, we mainly concentrated on QCD-like scenarios leading to jetty signatures at the LHC, but we also discussed signatures such as SUEPs and glueballs which are typically associated with non-QCD like theories.\nQCD-like scenarios, which are the main focus of this report, are inherently non-trivial to analyse due their nonperturbative nature. In such theories, confinement in the IR leads to bound states whose masses and interactions are governed by the UV dynamics. While the SM QCD has been analysed in great detail in terms of UV versus IR parametrizations, little is known for arbitrary gauge groups and flavor contents. Nevertheless, due to the interesting new signatures the strongly interacting scenarios could produce at the LHC, their phenomenology is being actively explored.\nIn this context, we began this report (see Sect. 2) with a review of the existing efforts and phenomenological parametrizations of QCD-like scenarios. We qualitatively illustrated the phenomenological differences obtained for various mediator mechanisms, giving rise to exotic LHC signatures such as emerging or semi-visible jets. We also discussed some existing experimental results constraining these models and ongoing efforts to search for these signatures.\nIf the dark sector is instead non QCD-like, other classes of spectacular signatures can be obtained in terms of SUEPs or glueballs. These were discussed Sect. 3, in which original\nphenomenological SUEP studies were presented, along with recent preliminary simulation tools for these scenarios.\nAfter this overview of existing efforts and of the signature landscape, the report also addressed in Sect. 4 possible pathways for consistent theory frameworks, especially concentrating on semi-visible jets. In that section, lattice calculations, chiral perturbation theory and an analysis of symmetry breaking due to SM-DS portals were combined to exemplify avenues in theoretical model building. Improvements to the pythia 8 Hidden Valley module, made in the context of this Dark Shower Snowmass project, were also presented along with their validation. Combining the theory developments with the new Hidden Valley module, we then illustrated their impact on the phenomenology of semi-visible jets.\nIn the final section of the report, Sect. 5, we discussed some proposed improvements to LHC search strategies. These include efforts using machine learning, trigger considerations and the definition of new event level variables.\nStrongly-interacting dark sectors are an exciting class of scenarios in which a vibrant community of theorists, phenomenologists and experimentalists is being invested. They could lead to spectacular signatures which have not yet been systematically explored at the LHC. In view of the large phenomenological interest of such theories, a more concentrated effort in theoretical work is needed, covering model building and classification of associated LHC signatures, a deeper understanding of hadronization physics, as well as studies of cross correlation with open problems of the SM such as the nature of dark matter. It is clear from this report that such a work involves communication among experts in SM QCD, lattice, and collider physics as well as in dark matter. We hope that our report lays down the foundations for such a\nwider exchange, and that this may help devising better strategies that could ultimately lead to a breakthrough in finding signals of strongly-interacting theories.\nAcknowledgements H.
