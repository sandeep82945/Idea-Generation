    "abstractText": "IMPORTANCE Beneficiaries dual eligible for Medicare and Medicaid account for a disproportionate share of expenditures due to their complex care needs. Lack of coordination between payment programs creates misaligned incentives, resulting in higher costs, fragmented care, and poor health outcomes. OBJECTIVE To inform the design of integrated programs by describing the health care use and spending for need-based subgroups in North Carolina\u2019s full benefit, dual-eligible population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study using Medicare and North Carolina Medicaid 100% claims data (2014-2017) linked at the individual level included Medicare beneficiaries with full North Carolina Medicaid benefits. Data were analyzed between 2021 and 2022. EXPOSURE Need-based subgroups: community well, homeand community-based services (HCBS) users, nursing home (NH) residents, and intensive behavioral health (BH) users. MEASURES Medicare and Medicaid utilization and spending per person-year (PPY). RESULTS The cohort (n = 333 240) comprised subgroups of community well (64.1%, n = 213 667), HCBS users (15.0%, n = 50 095), BH users (15.2%, n = 50 509), and NH residents (7.5%, n = 24 927). Overall, 61.1% reported female sex. The most common racial identities included Asian (1.8%), Black (36.1%), and White (58.7%). Combined spending for Medicare and Medicaid was $26 874 PPY, and the funding of care was split evenly between Medicare and Medicaid. Among need-based subgroups, combined spending was lowest among community well at $19 734 PPY with the lowest portion (38.5%) of spending contributed by Medicaid ($7605). Among NH residents, overall spending ($68 359) was highest, and the highest portion of spending contributed by Medicaid (70.1%). Key components of spending among HCBS users\u2019 combined total of $40 069 PPY were clinician services on carrier claims ($14 523) and outpatient facility services ($9012). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Federal and state policy makers and administrators are developing strategies to integrate Medicareand Medicaid-funded health care services to provide better care to the people enrolled in both programs. Substantial use of both Medicareand Medicaidfunded services was found across all need-based subgroups, and the services contributing a high proportion of the total spending differed across subgroups. The diversity of health care use suggests a tailored approach to integration strategies with comprehensive set benefits that comprises Medicare and Medicaid services, including long-term services and supports, BH, palliative care, and social services. JAMA Health Forum. 2023;4(5):e230973. doi:10.1001/jamahealthforum.2023.0973 Key Points Question For Medicare beneficiaries with full Medicaid benefits, how does the use of Medicare and Medicaid services and spending by payer differ across need-based subgroups? Findings This cross-sectional study including 333 240 Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries found that substantial use of Medicareand Medicaid-funded services across all subgroups and describes the services contributing the most to total spending differed across subgroups. Medicaidfunded services, including communitybased services and nursing home care, were key contributors to total spending among subgroups needing long-",

            "text": "Medicare and Medicaid fund different benefits and services, and integration of the 2 programs is critical to better serve the 12 million people enrolled in both programs.1 Dual-eligible beneficiaries are, on average, sicker and frailer than other Medicare- or Medicaid-only beneficiaries because many are living with multiple chronic comorbidities and experience functional limitations, cognitive impairments, and mental health conditions.2 The complex care needs of dual-eligible beneficiaries account for a disproportionate share of expenditures in both Medicare and Medicaid.3 Lack of coordination between programs creates misaligned incentives for payers and physicians, resulting in higher costs, fragmented care, and poor health outcomes.4\nAlthough evidence is limited, integrated models are intended to help align financial incentives with overall beneficiary experience and outcomes across the care continuum.5,6 Yet, relatively few dual-eligible beneficiaries are enrolled in integrated programs, such as the Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), or Medicare-Medicaid\u2013managed care plans including the Financial Alignment Initiative (FAI), and Dual Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs). The PACE provides fully integrated financial, health care, and administrative processes; however, PACE models are challenging to scale. Overall, D-SNPs are more widely used than PACE, with 3.8 million dual-eligible beneficiaries enrolled nationwide and varying degrees of coordination and integration between Medicare and Medicaid across states. Despite Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and state efforts, only around 10% of dual-eligible beneficiaries nationally are enrolled in programs that integrate Medicare and Medicaid care models, payments, and administrative processes.7\nPopulation heterogeneity poses challenges in expanding access to, and enrollment in, integrated payment models. Beneficiaries enroll in Medicare based on age or long-term disability, and qualify for state Medicaid based on income or health care needs. Disabled adults comprise more than half of the dual-eligible population but only 15% of the general Medicare population.8 In addition to physical medical care, dually eligible beneficiaries often need behavioral health (BH) services, longterm services and supports (LTSS), and social supports.3 Long-term services and supports include both home and community-based services (HCBS) and facility-based care. Evaluations informing Medicare-Medicaid integration must consider average utilization and cost patterns of dual-enrollees across both programs, including among beneficiary subgroups with different health care needs.\nMany studies of health outcomes use only Medicare spending and outcomes for this population, with few incorporating Medicaid data as well.9-12 The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has recently provided high-level data for the whole population,8 but did not examine cost and use variations across key subgroups, such as BH users or HCBS waiver participants. Other studies with linked Medicare-Medicaid claims focused on a specific type of service, subpopulation, or cost bracket.13-15 However, services with the highest spending may vary for different subgroups due to diverse care needs and differing access to services through Medicaid waiver programs.\nEvaluating Medicaid spending is challenging in states with high use of Medicaid-managed care organizations (MCO). Encounter data for MCOs are less accurate compared with fee-for-service (FFS) claims data, which are used for reimbursement.16,17 In North Carolina (NC), however, more than 95% of dual-eligible beneficiaries were served by FFS Medicaid in 2019. Thus, analysis of the NC dualeligible FFS population is more representative of the diversity of dual enrollees than in states where managed care is more prevalent. Compared with states with high managed care, evaluation of spending in NC may be more generalizable and applicable for policy recommendations due to availability of claims data on most of the Medicaid population. The NC population is also diverse in race and rurality and provides relevant context for other diverse states.18-20\nFederal and state policy makers and administrators are currently developing strategies for Medicare-Medicaid integration.21 To inform the design of integrated programs that will meet the diverse needs of dual enrollees, we describe the Medicare and Medicaid health care use and spending for subgroups with different health care needs in NC. The state of NC is currently implementing Medicaid transformation from FFS to Medicaid value-based care models. We examined FFS spending\nJAMA Health Forum. 2023;4(5):e230973. doi:10.1001/jamahealthforum.2023.0973 (Reprinted) May 12, 2023 2/12\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/09/2024\nboth overall and for need-based subgroups defined from the Medicaid program perspective to support federal and state decision-making."

Utilization and spending were evaluated among a subcohort of beneficiaries with at least 1 month of enrollment in Medicare FFS programs A and B and no enrollment in Medicare Advantage. Medicaid in NC was primarily FFS during the study period. The PACE enrollees were included in the initial cohort we used to evaluate enrollment in capitated models like PACE and Medicare Advantage; however, beneficiaries with PACE enrollment during the study period were excluded from the evaluation of cost and use due to incomplete information on health care use. The Duke Health institutional review board and North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services reviewed and approved this study. This report followed Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines.

Second, HCBS users included beneficiaries with any HCBS claims, specifically defined as personal care services, to identify individuals receiving long-term care in their home, assisted living or adult day home. Third, the nursing home group included beneficiaries with 100 or more consecutive days in a skilled nursing facility, identified with Medicaid place of service code indicating skilled nursing facility, nursing facility, or custodial care facility (regardless of Medicare payment status) in alignment with NC statute. Fourth, the high-intensity BH services users included individuals with claims indicating serious mental illness, substance use disorder, or intellectual or developmental disability (IDD)22 in the study period. Other than community well, the need-based subgroups are not mutually exclusive; beneficiaries could qualify for multiple groups over the time period. Characteristics and definitions for 1915(b)(c) waiver enrollees are presented in eTables 2-4 in Supplement 1).\nDemographic Information Patient demographics were extracted from the Medicaid member files, and Medicare values were used where Medicaid data were missing. Race and ethnicity data were self-reported in NC Medicaid and Medicare, and we retained missing values when unavailable in both data sources due to poor validity of imputation methods.23 Beneficiaries\u2019 county of residence was classified as rural or urban based on NC Department of Health and Human Services guidelines.24 The CMS Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) indicators identified those with a condition date prior to or during the study period."

Spending was calculated as the total amount paid by Medicaid and Medicare, with a per-diem adjustment included in inpatient spending for Medicare. Medicaid spending measures included all Medicaid FFS payments including professional, facility, and dental claims. Medicare spending included all parts A and B claims. Payments were adjusted for inflation using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate all spending in 2017 dollars."

Three notable models include the PACE, FAI, and D-SNPs. The PACE model provides full financial integration in addition to integrated care and administrative processes for individuals aged 55 years and older who require nursing facility level of care. The FAI model mostly tested a capitated model whereby states, CMS, and plans entered into a contract, called a Medicare-Medicaid Plan (MMP), for a blended capitation rate. Although CMS has closed the window for new enrollment in the Financial Alignment Initiative demonstrations, D-SNPs have permanent authorization under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. These D-SNPs are required to contract with the states (via State Medicaid Agency Contracts, SMACs) in which they operate, in addition to contracts with CMS, and must adhere to state and CMS requirements. Many states with D-SNPs have leveraged these SMACs\nTable 3.

For example, states can require D-SNP contracts in their state to meet CMS criteria for fully-integrated D-SNPs (FIDE-SNP).\nThe implications of this research for state and federal policies are particularly timely given the potential legislation pending at the national level to expand access to Medicare-Medicaid integrated programs. To increase access to integrated care, policy makers should consider expansion of PACE to new regions and populations. Multiple Senate and House bills (H.R.6770, S.1162, S.3626)21 propose expanding eligibility and geographic expansion for PACE, and other bills support integration planning at the state level (S.4264, S.4273, S.3630). Expansion of PACE can play an important role in future integration efforts in 2 ways. First, it allows more individuals who are eligible for PACE to enroll and receive integrated care. Second, PACE expansion increases opportunities for collaborative and innovative partnerships between non-PACE and PACE organizations serving dual-eligible beneficiaries. For example, in Massachusetts, managed care plans have partnered with PACE organizations to help deliver a PACE-like model in the community. In the absence of new legislation, states can use a combination of PACE and FIDE-SNPs to expand integrated options for dual-eligible beneficiaries.\nGiven the overlap and churn between need-based groups, a single plan and program offering the broad range of services will minimize disruption to care during transitions where integration and continuity are most needed. Integrated plans should include comprehensive Medicare and Medicaid services, including LTSS, BH, social services and other supplemental benefits to support wholeperson care. Medicare benefit packages have historically been restricted; however, more flexible benefits became available with the introduction of Medicare Advantage special needs plans in 2006, and have expanded over time to include LTSS, BH, palliative care, and other support services. New regulations require FIDE-SNPs to provide comprehensive Medicare and Medicaid services, including either long-stay nursing home care or behavioral health services. States contracting with D-SNPs should ensure options for integrated D-SNPs with comprehensive benefits are available in all regions, including rural areas.\nSimilar to PACE, integrated programs should conduct integrated assessments of dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2019 health risks, needs, and preferences to provide a comprehensive understanding of the whole person. A standard functional assessment tool would ensure development of an individualized person-centered care plan that is designed to meet the unique needs of high-risk beneficiaries and should be updated as needed to address beneficiaries\u2019 needs as they change over time and across care settings. Use of combined Medicare-Medicaid data can support implementation of tailored approaches for integration and care coordination to best serve each subgroup. Not only do Medicare and Medicaid fund different services, creating blind-spots in care, there are gaps in claims for services"

The difference between acute events observed in Medicare and events observed in Medicaid claims was highest among the nursing home resident subgroup, indicating that the need for Medicare claims data to facilitate care coordination is greatest in this group.\nThe business case for investing in preventive care and Medicaid services is strengthened when Medicare and Medicaid plans are financially aligned, meaning the same entity provides both Medicare and Medicaid services. In the context of financial alignment, improvements in LTSS (funded by Medicaid) that prevent acute care use (funded by Medicare) accrue to the same entity, creating the incentive for prevention of Medicare costs for Medicaid plans. In Medicare-only populations, inpatient spending accounts for the largest portion of total spending. This cross-sectional study found that acute and postacute services were not contributing the most to combined MedicareMedicaid spending for some subgroups of dual-eligible beneficiaries. This evidence points to shifting facility-based services to home and community-based settings, with appropriate oversight to ensure high-quality care, as a potential for improving efficiency in resource use and value of care.9,14,15,25"
