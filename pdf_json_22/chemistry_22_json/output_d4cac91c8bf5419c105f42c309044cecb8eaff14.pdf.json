    "abstractText": "Robust and easy-to-use NMR sensor technology is proposed for accurate, on-site determination of fat and protein contents in milk. The two parameters are determined using fast consecutive 1H and 35Cl low-field NMR experiments on milk samples upon the 1:1 addition of a low-cost contrast solution. Reliable and accurate measurements are obtained without tedious calibrations and the need for extensive database information and may readily be conducted by non-experts in production site environments. This enables on-site application at farms or dairies, or use in laboratories harvesting significant reductions in costs and time per analysis as compared to wet-chemistry analysis. The performance is demonstrated for calibration samples, various supermarket milk products, and raw milk samples, of which some were analyzed directly in the milking room. To illustrate the wide application range, the supermarket milk products included both conventionally/organically produced, lactose-free milk, cow\u2019s, sheep\u2019s and goat\u2019s milk, homogenized and unhomogenized milk, and a broad nutrient range (0.1\u20139% fat, 1\u20136% protein). Excellent agreement between NMR measurements and reference values, without corrections or changes in calibration for various products and during extensive periods of experiment conduction (4 months) demonstrates the robustness of the procedure and instrumentation. For the raw milk samples, correlations between NMR and IR, NMR and wetchemistry, as well as IR and wet-chemistry results, show that NMR, in terms of accuracy, compares favorably with the other methods.",

            "text": "Milk is a world-wide major food resource and as such is subject to extensive analysis requirements to ensure quality, nutritional yield, animal health, and production output. In modern farming, routine analysis is performed on milk delivered to dairies, and regular analyses are performed on the milk from individual animals providing indications on the nutritional balance of the milk as well as the health of the animal. For farmers, the milk analyses also provide essential information to control and optimize feeding and breeding strategies. At dairies and for milk manufacturers, milk analysis is performed as an essential part of the process control. Milk analysis is also important for product development, product price, quality assurance and research. The main parameters in milk analysis are typically the contents of fat and protein. Often the fat and protein contents are used to calculate the milk\u2019s value directly determining payment to farmers for delivered milk.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 583. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27030583 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 583 2 of 10\nToday, the vast majority of the huge number of milk analyses are performed using infrared (IR) spectroscopy with the instrumentation calibrated to database information by wet-chemistry (WC) methods like gravimetric analysis for fat content and Kjeldahl or Dumas analysis for protein content [1\u20133]. IR analysis provides fast determination (in the order of 30 s) of several parameters using benchtop instruments or on-line instruments for monitoring at production facilities. However, it is well known that IR analyses may suffer from calibration drifts and poor accuracy when not subjected to frequent and careful calibration to correctly chosen calibration samples of a similar type, origin, and nutritional value as the samples subject to analysis. Accordingly, IR instruments for measurements of milk samples are typically only operated by expert users from commercial laboratories, dairies, or research facilities. Wet-chemistry analysis either performed directly for milk sample analysis or forming the calibration basis for IR analysis are generally considered costly, time-consuming and demanding on required procedures and chemicals. It is worth noting that also the wetchemistry methods are associated with assumptions, in particularly for protein analysis which relies on the total nitrogen content scaling to protein contents by a fixed number [3,4], and are associated with analysis uncertainty as all measuring methods. It also generally applies that any method is not better than the provided sample and representativity of the typically very small subsamples taken for actual analysis. In this work, we introduce mobile, low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) sensor technology for robust, accurate, and operationally simple on-farm or laboratory quantification of fat and protein contents in milk performed directly on the milk samples upon the addition of a simple contrast solution. Since NMR relies on the direct detection of the response of isotopes (upon radio-frequency perturbation in a strong external magnetic field), NMR has the great advantage relative to optical methods (such as IR) in offering quantitative results for the bulk volume of the analyzed material. This implies that NMR has no requirement for an optical window or consideration of penetration depths, and NMR does not require the establishment and maintenance of extensive databases suitable for specific types of samples as applies to IR. Low-field and mobile NMR is currently undergoing tremendous development for laboratory analysis [5], and is now gradually also finding applications for production site analysis, which demand more robust and easier-to-apply instrumentation. We have, over the past years, developed multinuclear, mobile NMR sensors for production-line and laboratory analysis in as wide application areas as the quantification of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) in animal slurry [6,7] and waste water streams, salts (sodium and chloride) in food products, protein and phosphorus in livestock feed [8], onboard monitoring of catalytic fines (aluminum) in heavy fuel oil in the shipping industry [9], oxygen measurements [10], and benchtop solid-state NMR [11]. This instrumentation allows high sensitivity and fast switching between all relevant NMR isotopes, non-expertuser operations, and robustness for on-site applications. Aimed at accurate, on-site quantification of fat and protein contents in milk, we propose here an easy protocol allowing direct quantification using low-field NMR on milk samples upon the 1:1 addition of a simple contrast solution and temperature stabilization. The contrast solution is composed of a 6% regular salt (NaCl) solution containing 2% sodium ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Fe-EDTA), which is easily available at a low cost and is safe to use for non-experts. Relaxation agents (like Fe-EDTA) are well-known and widely applied for contrast improvements in magnetic resonance imaging [12,13] and for sensitivity improvements in NMR spectroscopy through the enhancement of the relaxation rate of interacting molecules, thereby enabling the conduction of faster experiments [14,15]. In the context of milk, the presence of paramagnetic iron (Fe(III)) significantly increases the relaxation rate of protons in water, while relaxation of protons in fat remains largely invariant due to a much lower degree of interaction with the iron ions. This easily-controlled editing of relaxation rates isolates the slow-relaxing fat components in the signal acquired using a standard Carr\u2013Purcell\u2013Meiboom\u2013Gill (CPMG) type [16,17] echo-train of pulses,\nMolecules 2022, 27, 583 3 of 10\nwhich enables stable and precise quantification of the fat signal with minimal interference from the water proton signal. Under normal circumstances, without contrast solutions, the water dramatically dominates the signal preventing precise information about the fat content unless the water is removed by drying prior to measurement [18,19]\u2014which, however, tend to be impractical and time-consuming as it requires all water to be evaporated or the part left quantified\u2014or potentially using instrumentation equipped with very strong field gradients [19\u201321] which needs careful calibration to discriminate components in terms of spin diffusion. The proposed 35Cl NMR method for quantification of protein relies on 35Cl transverse relaxation rate (R2 = 1/T2; T2 is the transverse relaxation time), which we, for milk samples, have found to correlate well with the actual content of protein with minimal interference from varying amounts of other constituents such as fat and lactose. We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism is the electrostatic interaction between chloride ions and the partly charged sites on the protein. This interaction with large particles introduces a linear (at least in the desired concentration range) change of the relaxation rates for all dissolved chloride ions due to the fast chemical exchange of interacting and free chloride ions. The addition of NaCl in relatively high concentrations facilitates fast detection of the otherwise relatively insensitive chlorine isotope, and furthermore ensures a sufficient amount of free chloride ions relative to the numbers of protein interaction sites. Combining the easy sample handling procedures and the detection principles outlined above with robust and accurate multinuclear NMR sensors provides a new highly reliable method for the quantification of fat and protein in milk, with easy operation and without the demands for frequent calibrations nor reference to large databases. The NMR measurements can be conducted by non-experts in a rough production-line environment providing immediate and accurate results on the site of application (e.g., directly at farms, at dairies, or in laboratories). It can be applied in all situations, including situations where demanding calibration and maintenance of alternative IR instrumentation cannot be fulfilled. In a different approach, the proposed method may serve as an alternative to wet-chemistry methods, possibly stepping in as a reference method for the calibration of on-line IR instruments. We also envisage that the proposed method may be extended to applications in a flow-system with the automatic injection of contrast solution and temperature stabilization. This, however, is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate the performance of the low-field NMR relative to IR and laboratory methods, we have evaluated various supermarket milk products and raw milk samples (some analyzed on-farm in the milking room). The samples were collected and evaluated over a period of about 4 months without corrections or changes in calibration, which along with the broad range of milk types serves to illustrate the broad range, stability, and robustness of the technology."

The calibration samples were three different pasteurized and homogenized samples and two different raw milk samples. We note that the calibration samples from the provider were added Bronopol preservative and a dye, giving the samples a green color which we, however, do not ascribe any significant perturbation on the measurements due to the low concentration.

However, we should note that the correlation between NMR results and reference data were significantly better for the calibration samples (Section 2.1), which we ascribe to more reliable reference values for the calibration samples since these are presumably subject to carefully analysis at the supplier.

            "text": "To evaluate the precision of the NMR measurements, all samples were analyzed for two duplicate samples and with two repeated measurements for each sample (see Material and Methods). Table 2 shows calculated STDs for the repeated measurements and for duplicate samples given for specified sample types and in groups of homogenized/unhomogenized\nmilk. The STDs are calculated using sdupl = \u221a 1 2n \u2211 n i=1 ( xAi \u2212 xBi )2, with sdupl being the STD for duplicates or repeated measurements as given in reference [22], while xAi and x B i are the two results for the n duplicate/repeat pairs. The results in Table 2 reveal that NMR provides an excellent precision for quantification of fat and protein in milk. For fat, on all samples, the STDs on repeated measurements (measuring time 1 min) are 0.02\u20130.04%, while, for homogenized samples, the STDs on duplicate samples are as low as 0.01\u20130.03%. We note that for each duplicate sample the measurement reflects the average of two repeated evaluations (2 min in total on each sample for fat). For fat on unhomogenized samples, the STDs for duplicates are higher (0.05\u20130.21%), which most likely occur due to inhomogeneity in the samples which may be particularly visible for the raw milk samples. For protein, on all samples, STDs on repeated measurements (3 min) are 0.09\u20130.19%, while on duplicate samples (measuring time 6 min) the STDs are 0.05\u20130.15%. For both fat and protein, the results show that the measuring times of 1 min per sample for fat and 3 min per sample for protein seems appropriate for most practical applications with the current setup and instrumentation. For low-fat products like skimmed milk, an improved precision on fat measurements can be obtained using a longer measuring time and/or an alternatively prepared sample aiming at higher Fe-EDTA concentration and less dilution. For example, using 5 min measurements on samples with 4% Fe-EDTA added as powder to skimmed milk, we obtained an STD of 0.005% for repeated fat measurements. Especially for fat, the results also indicate that the reproducibility of measurements may benefit from sample homogenization prior to sampling as also expected for all other accurate methods. Alternatively, in all cases, the obtained accuracy obviously benefits from the evaluation of replicate samples, minimizing the uncertainty induced by sampling. For NMR, the use of replicate samples may allow the shortening of individual measuring times to a total duration aligning with the times given above, since the contribution from intrinsic noise of NMR measurements is also minimized across analysis of multiple samples.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 583 8 of 10"

First, a bi-exponential fit (y = Iwater exp(\u2212t/T2,water) + Ifat exp(\u2212t/T2,fat)) was performed on the echo-train data\nMolecules 2022, 27, 583 9 of 10\nwith the exclusion of the first 15 echo groups (165 echoes, roughly 50 ms). This provided the intensity of the fat signal (T2,fat ~ 200\u2013300 ms) with minimized interference from the water signal (T2,water ~ 20 ms). Thereafter, a mono-exponential fit was performed on the first 15 echo groups (with the calculated fat signal decay subtracted) to obtain the non-fat part of the total 1H NMR signal. This allows the calculation of the ratio between the fat 1H NMR signal to the total 1H NMR signal, using the fat intensity from the first fit and the total intensity as the sum of the fat intensity and the non-fat intensity obtained from the second fit. While this is obviously also directly achievable from a bi-exponential fit on the full echo-train signal, we found the serial two-fits procedure to be more robust. For protein, the chlorine relaxation rate (R2) is obtained by a mono-exponential fit (y = A exp(\u2212tR2)) to the 35Cl NMR echo-train signal decay. In all cases, the performed exponential fits are standard least squares fits."
