    "abstractText": "Background: the negative consequences of COVID-19 distancing measures on older adults\u2019 mental health and ability to access services have been well documented. Online cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness interventions for older adults, carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, have shown that these interventions are feasible and have potential mental health benefits. However, little research has been carried out on older adults\u2019 experiences of engaging with online psychological therapy, and specifically mindfulness therapy. Objectives: to understand the experience of older adults engaging with online mindfulness therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design: a qualitative analysis of four community-based focus groups. Participants: thirty-six community dwelling older adults aged between 65 and 85 years were recruited via older adult organisations, charities and the local press. Nineteen percent had long-term physical health conditions, 25% had severe and enduring mental health difficulties and 19% had mild to moderate mental health difficulties. Results: there was a strong sense of group cohesion and community from the participants. Three main themes were identified: reasons for applying, experience of the mindfulness therapy and connecting at home. Conclusions: the majority of participants were positive about attending a mindfulness group online. This extended to the perceived psychological and social benefits as well as practical considerations. While some participants noted technological hurdles at the beginning of the course, the findings challenge previous studies that suggest older adults are reluctant to engage in online psychological therapies and has important implications for the future provision of psychological therapies to this population.",

            "text": "Older adults face a steeper recovery curve from COVID-19 than the general population [1] in what has been described as a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 for older adult\u2019s mental health [2]. The proportion of over 70s with depression increased from 5% in July 2019 to March 2020 to 10% in June 2020 following 3 months of COVID-19 restrictions [3], and it will be important to consider the accessibility of psychological therapies in the recovery from the pandemic, particularly where anxiety or depression levels are preventing older adults from leaving home [4]. Where older adults\u2019 reluctance to attend face-to-face mental health services is compounded by already stretched mental health services after the pandemic [1], the risk is that a group which is already disproportionately affected by COVID-19 may find it difficult to access appropriate services.\nMobile Health (mHealth), synchronous and asynchronous online therapy groups are a rapidly expanding field which have the potential to improve the accessibility of psychological interventions for older adults. For low intensity intervention, there is some evidence that selfdirected online and asynchronous psychological intervention is experienced positively by older adults. Vailati Riboni et al. [5] found that a mindfulness app designed for older adults was reported as beneficial, and improved participants opinions of technology. Hudson et al. [6] reported that older adult caregivers found online mindfulness a positive experience, and that it helped them to develop strategies to support them in their caregiving. This study used optional synchronous web sessions alongside pre-recorded sessions. During the 1-h sessions, participants were able to interact via the web chat function.\nWhere psychological therapies are directly translated to a synchronous online intervention, studies have reported outcomes of online psychological therapy to support mental health for older adults in Israel [7, 8] and China [9]. These studies all used an intervention based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in combination with mindfulness skills. The interventions were between five and seven sessions long and delivered to either community dwelling older adults [7, 8] or care home residents [9]. The Ying et al. [9] intervention was self-guided with support from clinicians via webchat, and the Shapira et al. [7, 8] sessions were delivered synchronously via zoom. All studies reported significant reductions in loneliness and depression, with Ying et al. [9] additionally reporting reductions in anxiety, functional disability and general psychological distress. Shapira et al. [7] and Ying [9] also found significant reductions on follow-up, 1 month later.\nHowever, there is limited evidence on the acceptability of these interventions, and how they are experienced by participants. Ying et al. [9] reported that 80% of participants would recommend their programme to others, and 88% felt that it was worth doing. However, no acceptability data was provided by the 23% of participants who dropped out of the study, nor was acceptability data provided by Shapira et al.\n[7, 8]. Thus, there is a clear need to explore the experience of synchronous online psychological therapies for older adults, particularly where they may support psychological recovery from COVID-19.\nThus, the current study looks to understand the experience of older adults engaging with an online mindfulness course during the COVID-19 pandemic. This course was delivered in a fully synchronous format via zoom, with the format and content of the group being directly translated to the online environment as much as possible. The aim of this study is to understand how both the mindfulness therapy and online environment was experienced by participants."

In addition, participants were split into smaller \u2018breakout\u2019 rooms to discuss a mindfulness topic. Between the sessions, participants were encouraged to listen to the guided mindfulness practices they had been given once a day (formal practice) and had the option to choose everyday tasks to carry out mindfully (informal practice).

The first national lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic began on 26 March 2020 when those who were particularly vulnerable due to underlying medical problems typical to older adults such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and cancer were advised to \u2018shield\u2019 from face to face contact with other people. Aside from these medical issues, older people in general were found to be more vulnerable to COVID-19. Restrictions were eased over the summer of 2020, but the second and third national lockdown began in November 2020 and January 2021, respectively. At the time the final focus group was held, restrictions prevented indoor gatherings, and outdoor meetings were limited to two people from different households. The \u2018stay at home\u2019 order remained in place.\nEthical consideration The data were collected as part of a service development and evaluation programme for the Gatehouse Charity in East Anglia in response to COVID-19, and thus exempt from research ethics approval [11, 12]. Participants provided written informed consent via an online form to participate in the focus group, and for the session to be recorded, and transcribed anonymously. Additional written informed consent was obtained for focus group data to be published in reports and peer-reviewed publications. Information about the structure of the focus group was emailed to each participant. Participants were informed that participation in the focus group, and dissemination of the findings was optional and would not impact on their ability to attend the mindfulness course.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ageing/article/51/12/afac270/6881503 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024"

Based on self-report data and assessment interview, 19% had longterm physical health conditions, 25% had severe and enduring mental health difficulties, and 19% had mild to moderate mental health difficulties (Table 1). We used the definition of severe mental illness as one which is \u2018prolonged and recurrent, impair[s] activities of daily living, and require[s] longterm treatment. Common diagnoses include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression\u2019 [15]. Conversely, mild to moderate mental health difficulties were those which were not recurrent, did not require long-term treatment or impair activities of daily living. These data were collected as part of the online application process, before the MLL groups began. Most participants (83%) attended all six of the course sessions, 14% attended five and 3% attended four.\nThree main themes were developed from the focus group data: reasons for applying, experience of mindfulness therapy and connecting at home (Figure 2). We discuss these themes below in relation to older adults\u2019 experience of engaging with online therapy during COVID-19.\nA subtheme was mapped as overlapping where it merged across two or more themes: the subthemes are discussed under the theme in which most of the participant\u2019s\ndiscussion took place. As indicated by Figure 2, the experiences of the participants were framed within the unique context of the COVID pandemic. Whilst participants contextualised each of the themes within the COVID pandemic to varying degrees, subthemes also overlapped in important ways. For example, the experience of video conferencing was in some ways inseparable from the necessity of using this technology at home, of the type of therapy delivered via it, and the reason for engaging with it in the first place. Table 2 outlines the themes and subthemes against their illustrative data extracts."

These tools helped the participants deal with the uncertainty of the pandemic and life\u2019s challenges, and the structure of the course itself was appreciated at a time of change and instability \u2018 there was always an introduction to a new technique, and it was good that it was introduced within the group obviously and the learning process took place within the group\u2019 (BU66f ).\nLiving in the present became valuable to many participants as plans had to change due to factors outside of their control and being encouraged to focus on the present helped with anxiety around an uncertain future \u2018 just live in the moment, realise that thoughts of the future, and worry\nand so on are best left there.

For some people, this was an uncomfortable but helpful process whether noticing that they had little interaction with others \u2018I have found it really helpful in recognising and facing up to the fact that I\u2019ve been very insular.

            "text": "This paper explored older adults experience of engaging with an online mindfulness course for later life course during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were largely positive about their experience of attending a mindfulness therapy group online. This extended to the psychological and social benefits as well as practical considerations. There was a strong sense of group cohesion and community, as well as a gratitude for being able to engage with mindfulness as a support through COVID-19. Whilst some participants noted challenges to using technology, particularly at the beginning of the course, the findings support the Ying et al . study [9] showing that older adults felt that it was worth engaging with an online psychological therapy.\nOf course, we need to consider the social context of the pandemic in shaping the extent to which videoconferencing has been used, and the impetus for people to find tools to help them navigate the challenges of the pandemic. National lockdowns left participants feeling isolated, lonely and missing usual social interactions, as is well documented in current literature [2], and the intervention gave them the opportunity to connect socially online. Some participants found aspects of the technology challenging, but all participants were able to access and engage with the course.\nWith time freed up from cancelled social engagements, participants reported being more able to commit to the course timetable and apply themselves to the content. This is also evident by the high course attendance. Participation in the online course provided structure and stability in an uncertain world. Participants reported they were able to use what they had learned to manage feelings of anxiety, remain calmer in stressful situations brought on by the pandemic such as inability to see their family, and acceptance of situations outside of their control, for example absence of usual valued National Health Service (NHS) services [1]. Consistent with the findings from Hudson et al . [6] they were also able to develop their self-reflection by learning to turn their attention away from external events and find calm by looking inwards, both during the online sessions and afterwards.\nConsistent with previous research on online healthcare with older adults [1], we heard that most participants found attending the group at home was more convenient than travelling to a venue. Some participants were housebound or suffered physical disabilities where sitting for a period of time was uncomfortable. Similarly, many of our participants lived in rural areas which were considered to be too remote from the towns where face-to-face groups would normally be held.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ageing/article/51/12/afac270/6881503 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nBeyond the practicalities, participants reported feeling more relaxed in their own home environment which contributed to an openness to both the therapy and relationships within the group. Most participants felt more confident meeting strangers in an already familiar environment. Overall, meeting the other group members over video conferencing as opposed to face to face did not seem to inhibit group cohesiveness. In fact, it tended to enhance the level of intimacy experienced, participants felt that they had been invited into each other\u2019s homes. They were able to see, for example, photographs, d\u00e9cor and pets and this familiarity with others home environment may have contributed positively to sharing feelings and vulnerabilities in the group. Despite not sharing the same physical space as other group members, most participants reported experiencing a sense of fellowship during group mindfulness practices."

            "heading": "Strengths and limitations",
            "text": "There are some limitations of our research. Most participants were female and all lived with family members or independently, and our research did not cover adults in later life who lived in a care home.\nMost participants had held higher managerial or professional roles and were white British, and so further work may benefit from engaging with other socioeconomic and ethnic groups and those that may have had minimal use of computers in their working career. Indeed, some participants thought that the technology involved with the online course would put some people off applying.\nNotwithstanding the limitations, this study has some notable strengths. Firstly, as an online intervention, participants could have been anywhere in the country allowing those who may not participate in interventions or research to do so. This is the first study to explore older adults\u2019 experiences of attending an online mindfulness intervention and provides useful insights into what works and how interventions can be designed to overcome any barriers to implementing psychological therapies online for this population.\nImplications for research, clinical practice and policy\nGoing forward it will be important to have a more nuanced discussion of the appropriateness and acceptability of online psychological therapy. We need to consider the types of online therapy more closely, for example, the level of social interaction with an app is quite different from a synchronous zoom session. However, our findings challenge the idea that \u2018ageing in place\u2019 reflects a passive process of older adults receiving care in their homes and of adaptations being made to limit reductions in independence [16]. For inclusivity, future research could focus on assessing the acceptability and feasibility of using a hybrid model to provide psychological therapies to enable both those who prefer to join face to face and online to participate.\nThese findings also have important implications for clinical practice and policy when providing and commissioning psychological therapies for this population. In contrast to the dominant narrative of older adults being unwilling or unable\nto engage in online psychological therapy, our findings reflect that older adult participants in the mindfulness for later life group experienced connection both to the facilitator and to other group members. This fostered a sense of community, offered a safe haven during COVID-19 and allowed participants to not only age in place [17, 18] but also \u2018connect in place\u2019. Importantly, this reduced the impact of living in a rural location, difficulties attending face-to-face settings due to COVID-19 and built on the sense of safety that attending from home provided.\nConclusion\nOur findings are characterised by participants\u2019 impetus and willingness to engage online, utilising technology to overcome practical and societal barriers, and importantly, \u2018connecting in place\u2019 and experiencing an improvement in their mental well-being and social connections despite the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSupplementary Data: Supplementary data mentioned in the text are available to subscribers in Age and Ageing online.\nDeclaration of Conflicts of Interest: None.\nDeclaration of Sources of Funding: A.P. and A.S. were supported by an East and West Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group Equity in Mind project grant.
