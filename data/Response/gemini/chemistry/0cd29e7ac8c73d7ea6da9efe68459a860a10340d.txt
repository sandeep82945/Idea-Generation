1. **Investigate the effects of different hydrolysis conditions on the antioxidant activity of soy protein hydrolysates.** This could involve varying the enzyme concentration, temperature, and pH of the hydrolysis reaction.
2. **Identify the specific peptides in the pepsin hydrolysate that are responsible for its antioxidant activity.** This could be done using mass spectrometry and other analytical techniques.
3. **Test the antioxidant activity of soy protein hydrolysates in other food systems.** This could include using them to stabilize other types of oils or to protect food products from oxidation.
4. **Investigate the potential health benefits of soy protein hydrolysates.** This could include studying their effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and other chronic diseases.
5. **Develop new food products that incorporate soy protein hydrolysates as antioxidants.** This could include developing new types of oil-based products, such as salad dressings and mayonnaise, as well as new types of food products, such as fortified cereals and snacks.
