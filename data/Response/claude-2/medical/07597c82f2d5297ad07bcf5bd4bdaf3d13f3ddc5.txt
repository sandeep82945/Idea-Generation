 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the molecular mechanisms by which CB2 receptor stimulation modulates iron transporters TfR1 and FPN-1. Unraveling these signaling pathways could provide insights into new therapeutic targets. 

2. Evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of combining CB2 agonists with lower doses of corticosteroids in DMD mouse models. This could potentially maintain efficacy while reducing side effects.

3. Explore the impact of CB2 stimulation on muscle regeneration and fibrosis in DMD. CB2 activation may have direct effects on muscle cells beyond immune modulation. 

4. Identify other components of the endocannabinoid system that may be dysregulated in DMD and can serve as therapeutic targets, such as enzymes involved in endocannabinoid synthesis or degradation. 

5. Develop more potent and selective CB2 agonists and test their efficacy in preclinical DMD models. Structure-activity relationship studies could optimize CB2 targeting over other cannabinoid receptors.
