Because they are key components to achieve fusion on high energy laser facilities, final fused silica optics are analyzed after each laser shot. The quantification of damage sites is limited by the image resolution. Measurements of scattered light by damage sites allow for sub-pixel detection and growth monitoring after a calibration step based on time-consuming measurements laser facilities. It is proven herein that modeling laser damage size monitoring based on light scattering is efficient to link gray levels to damage diameters, thereby avoiding any experimental calibration based on a reference optics on the facility. \u00a9 2022 Optica Publishing Group 1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1364/ao.XX.XXXXXX2 3\nHigh power laser facilities such as the National Ignition Facility4 (NIF), ShenGuang-III (SG-III) and Laser MegaJoule (LMJ) were5 designed to achieve fusion by inertial confinement [1\u20133]. For6 each laser beam, multi-kilojoule ultraviolet (UV) laser energy7 with nanosecond pulse duration is required. Under such ex-8 treme laser conditions, optical components made of fused silica9 are prone to laser-induced damage [4]. Once a damage site has10 initiated, it grows after each UV laser shot since the laser energy11 is greater than the growth threshold, which is usually the case for12 fusion scale laser facilities [5]. To some extent, the performances13 of such large installations are therefore limited by laser-induced14 damage of final optics [6]. To partially overcome this issue, two15 complementary methods were developed, namely, Carbon Diox-16 ide (CO2) laser optics mitigation and local laser shadowing [7].17 CO2 laser optics mitigation is possible as long as the damage18 size is less than 750 \u00b5m. However, the mitigation requires the19 optics to be removed from the facility. Small parts of the laser20 beam may be shaded to stop the growth of critical damage sites,21 and therefore dictate the number of optics removals. Hence, it22 is necessary to detect damage sites and quantify their growth23 before they reach the mitigation limit. In order to be sure that no24 damage site reaches the mitigation limit (750 \u00b5m in diameter), a25 corresponding safety margin of about a factor 2 on the estimated26\ndamage diameter is taken, so that the limit used at LMJ is 300 \u00b5m.27 This margin takes into account the measurement error on the28 diameter as well as the possibility for a damage site to exceed29 750 \u00b5m in diameter after one supplementary laser shot with high30 fluence. Images of the final optics are acquired after each laser31 shot using similar imaging systems at NIF, SG-III and LMJ [7\u20139].32 The optics are illuminated from the edge. Light is internally33 trapped in the optics until it reaches a damage site that scatters34 it. A part of the scattered light from damage sites is collected35 by the imaging system at a distance of 8 m. The acquired im-36 ages are dark-fields with bright spots corresponding to damage37 sites. The image resolution (\u2248 100 \u00b5m/pixel) is not sufficient38 to accurately measure the diameter of damage sites less than39 300 \u00b5m by counting the number of lit pixels in the image. This40 low accuracy on diameter measurements is not compatible with41 damage growth quantification required for efficient mitigation.42\nLight scattering methods are widely used to estimate the size43 of proteins [10]. To measure damage growth with sub-pixel44 resolution without modifying the imaging and acquisition sys-45 tems, one proposed solution is to use the gray levels of acquired46 images due to damage light scattering [7]. However, images47 may suffer from some disturbances [11]. Techniques based on48 Digital Image Correlation (DIC) principles were proposed to cor-49 rect these acquired images. After corrections, the pixel intensity50 variations are only affected by damage growth and acquisition51 noise [11]. Since light scattering from molecules allows their ra-52 dius of gyration and weight to be estimated, the signals emitted53 by light scattering from laser damage sites may provide infor-54 mation about their diameter, depth and possibly their growth.55 Thanks to an image calibration process, it was shown that inte-56 grated gray levels were positively correlated to damage sizes [7].57 This calibration process required an optical component to be58 prepared with numerous laser damage sites with different sizes,59 to be mounted on the installation, and images of the damaged60 optic to be acquired. In the busy operational schedule of large61 fusion-scale laser facilities, this method is time-consuming, es-62 pecially since this calibration must be performed for each of the63 laser beams due to possible variations in lighting conditions.64\nIn this paper, an optical model-based calibration is proposed65 to estimate damage diameters from gray levels instead of using66 a reference optics mounted on the facility. The optical model67\nof the image acquisition process makes gray level simulations68 possible. The model may be used after revision or potential69 structural modification of the acquisition system to avoid a new70 online time-consuming calibration. It is based on damage light71 scattering measurements, optical simulation of the lighting sys-72 tem, and a numerical model of the image acquisition system.73 The image acquisition system of laser-induced damage on LMJ74 final optics is first described. Each step of the modeling process75 is presented, namely, lighting system, light scattering by damage76 sites, and imaging system. An image of a vacuum window with77 930 damage sites was acquired on the LMJ facility to be used78 as reference for the simulations. The results are presented and79 compared to the reference image to assess experimental-free,80 model-based only, damage size measurements from gray levels.81\nThe monitored 176 final optics at LMJ, among which the so-82 called vacuum windows, are distributed all around the 8 m in83 radius experiment chamber. A vacuum window is a 40 cm large84 optical component. To make damage sites visible, each vacuum85 window is illuminated by 2 green Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs)86 mounted on one edge of the components. Such LEDs have a87 maximum emissivity at 525 nm wavelength. Light provided by88 the LEDs enters into the optics and illuminates the rear and front89 sides of the vacuum windows. Aluminum alloy frames main-90 tain the optical components. The light that reaches the frame91 is reflected in the vacuum window. Laser damage sites, mainly92 located on the front face, scatter light. A part of this scattered93 light is collected by an objective lens that images vacuum win-94 dows on a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) sensor. It converts the95 collected light energy into gray levels. The image acquisition96 configuration is shown in Figure 1(a). The optical model pre-97 sented hereafter is divided into several parts (lighting system,98 light scattering by damage sites and imaging system). Using99 the proposed model, the integrated pixel intensity of a damage100 site is expressed as a function of damage site size and lighting101 parameters. The two LEDs, the fused silica vacuum window and102 its aluminum alloy frame were considered as the lighting system.103 The following simplifying assumptions were made, namely, re-104 flections on the frame were considered as specular, screws and105 other small mounting devices of the frame were removed from106 the model for ray tracing considerations, optical anti-reflection107 coating in the UV wavelength of the vacuum window was not108 modeled. Under these assumptions, the input data of the light-109 ing system model were the parameters of Nichia NSPG500DS110 LED (wavelength emissivity, angular distribution of emission,111 light intensity), the geometry of a vacuum window with beveled112 corners made of fused silica (Heraeus Suprasil), the simplified113 geometry and reflectivity of the optical frame in aluminum alloy.114 These input data were implemented in the ray tracing software115 Zemax OpticStudio in a non-sequential mode [12]. A square ma-116 trix of 100 rectangular detectors collected the incident radiance117 [Wm\u22122sr\u22121] on the front face of the vacuum window for several118 positions on the surface as shown as orange boxes in Figure 1(b).119\n120\nOnce the previously simulated incident light reached a dam-121 age site, the latter scattered it according to the Bidirectional122 Scattering Distribution Function (BSDF) [13, 14]. The BSDF links123 the scattered radiance by a surface, Ls [Wm\u22122sr\u22121], and the124 incident irradiance on the surface, Ei [Wm\u22122], for the incident125 angles \u03b8i and \u03d5i, as well as the scattered angles \u03b8s and \u03d5s (spher-126 ical coordinate system)127\nBSDF(\u03b8i, \u03d5i, \u03b8s, \u03d5s) = dLs(\u03b8i, \u03d5i, \u03b8s, \u03d5s) dEi(\u03b8i, \u03d5i, \u03b8s, \u03d5s)\n(1)\nTo simulate the amount of scattered light toward the imag-128 ing system, the BSDF, a quantity corresponding to the illumi-129 nated object and independent of the lighting system, needs to be130 known. It was proposed to measure the dispersion as a function131 of angle, and to relate it to surface statistics [15]. Since then,132 many works linked the surface roughness to the scattering func-133 tion from smooth to rough surfaces [14]. However, the validity134 of these models was limited to surface scattering. A damage135 site can be seen as a crater in hundreds of micrometers with136 sub-surface cracks [16]. Scattering surface models did not take137 into account the interaction between crater scattering (surface)138 and sub-surface crack scattering (volume).139\nIt is also possible to measure directly the BSDF of a sample in140 reflection and transmission [14]. In this paper, it was chosen to141 measure the BSDF of 12 damage sites whose diameters ranged142 from 100 \u00b5m to 700 \u00b5m. The 12 damage sites were initiated with143 a 1064 nm wavelength laser at 8 ns pulse duration on circular144 fused silica wafers (1 mm in thickness and 10 cm in diameter)145 with no optical coating. Two sites, 5 cm apart and 2.5 cm from146 the wafer edge, were created. For larger sites, multi-laser shots147 were performed to grow the sites to the specified size. Despite148 the damage mechanisms being different between ultraviolet and149 infrared wavelengths, damage sites initiated at wavelengths of150 351 nm and 1064 nm were both described as molten craters be-151 neath which occurred fractures similar to Hertzian cone cracks152 for diameters greater than 200 \u00b5m [17, 18]. This is the reason153 why the simulation was based on the BSDFs measured for the 5154 largest damage sites, i.e., diameters greater than 200 \u00b5m. Two of155 them are shown in Figure 2. The scattering measurements were\n156\nperformed with the Spectral and Angular Light Scattering char-157 acterization Apparatus in its 4th configuration (SALSA 4) [19].158 The measured quantity with SALSA 4 is the Angle Resolved159 Scattering (ARS)160\nARS(\u03b8i, \u03d5i, \u03b8s, \u03d5s) = BSDF(\u03b8i, \u03d5i, \u03b8s, \u03d5s) cos(\u03b8i) (2)\nThe BSDFs were measured for all damage sites at 525 nm wave-161 length, which matched the maximum emissivity of the LMJ162 lighting system. The lighting conditions of the damage sites163 were different in laser facilities (from the edge) and SALSA 4 (a164 6 mm in diameter laser beam illuminated the damage site whose165 ARS was measured at several angles). The beam was sufficiently166 large to fully illuminate each damage site during the measure-167 ments. The BSDF of undamaged fused silica was measured to be168 1000 times lower than that of damage sites. Thus, the scattered169 light by undamaged silica was not taken into account in the sim-170 ulations. The energy of light collected by the objective lens of the171 LMJ imaging system was computed using ARS measurements172 and the simulated incident radiance. The scattered radiance of a173 damage site toward the objective of the imaging system reads174\nLs = 4\u03c02 \u222b\n\u03b8i \u222b \u03d5i \u222b \u03b8s ARS(\u03b8i, \u03d5i, \u03b8s)Li(\u03b8i, \u03d5i)d\u03b8id\u03d5id\u03b8s (3)\nfor \u03b8i \u2208 [0; \u03c02 ]; \u03b8s \u2208 [\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b1, \u03c0] and \u03d5s \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], where \u03b1 is the175 object aperture angle of the objective lens. The scattered flux176 toward the objective lens \u03a6s [W] reads177\n\u03a6s = Ls cos(\u03b8obj)Ad2\u03c0(1 \u2212 cos(\u03b1)) (4)\nwhere Ls [Wm\u22122sr\u22121] is the scattered radiance toward the objec-178 tive, Ad [m2] the area of the damage site, \u03b1 the objective aperture179 angle, and \u03b8obj the angle between the normal axis to the face of180 the vacuum window and the optical axis of the camera. The181 scattered flux to the objective lens was considered as constant182 over the acquisition time of the camera \u2206t [s]. Thus, the scattered183 light energy, Es [J] toward the objective lens reduced to184\nEs = \u03a6s\u2206t (5)\nOnce the scattered energy toward the objective lens was com-185 puted, the integrated signal of gray levels was obtained by mod-186 eling the CCD sensor. Several conversions were performed187 (light energy to photons to electrons to gray levels). The total188 integrated signal (TIS) reads189\nTIS = w EsQE h\u03bdFc\n(6)\nwhere the coefficient w is a constant weight used to calibrate the190 model on measurements, Es the scattered light energy, QE the191 Quantum Efficiency of the CCD sensor, h Planck\u2019s constant, \u03bd the192 frequency of light, and Fc the conversion factor from electrons to193 gray levels of the CCD sensor. The purpose of the coefficient w194 was to compensate for errors due to the lack of exact knowledge195 of some system parameters.196 To validate the results of simulations using the above men-197 tioned model, 930 damage sites were initiated on a new vacuum198 window. A Nd:YAG laser set-up was used to initiate damage199 sites [20]. Damage site diameters were measured with an optical200 microscope before the component was mounted on the facility.201 The diameters of these sites ranged between 50 \u00b5m and 270 \u00b5m,202 and they are referred to as true diameters. An image of this203 optical component illuminated by the lighting system was ac-204 quired by the imaging device once it was mounted on the LMJ205\nbeam. The TIS was measured for each damage site by summing206 the gray levels of lit pixels describing the damage site in the207 acquired image. It is plotted as a function of the true diameter208 of damage sites in Figure 3.209 The incident light is collected by the area of each damage210 site. The flux scattered by a damage site is proportional to its211 surface area (see Eq. (4)). Thus, it was chosen to interpolate the212 measured TIS with a square power law in diameter (i.e., linear213 in area)214\nTISm = \u03ba (\nD D0\n)2 (7)\nwhere D denotes the diameter of the damage site, D0 the physi-215 cal size of one pixel (100 \u00b5m), and \u03ba the scale parameter equal216 to 3.5 \u00d7 103 gray level. The estimated diameter using TIS was217 directly obtained from Eq. (7).218 The TIS of 5 damage sites (including a, b in Figure 2) were219 simulated for the 100 positions on the vacuum window corre-220 sponding to the 100 rectangular detectors used to collect the221 incident radiance in the simulation. The damage diameters for222 the simulation varied from 230 \u00b5m to 550 \u00b5m, corresponding to223 about the largest size where damage mitigation was possible224 (white area in Figure 3). The simulated TISs was also interpo-225 lated by the same power law. As shown in Figure 3, for any size226 of the damage sites, all TIS obtained by simulation or acquisi-227 tion were in agreement with Eq. (7). The proposed model was228 deemed efficient to simulate TIS measured by the LMJ acquisi-229 tion system. For most damage sites, the greater the incident light230 energy, the higher the TIS. However, some exceptions were ob-231 served, which were presumably due to model approximations,232 morphology differences or scattering interactions between sites.233\n234 Figure 4 shows the result of diameter estimation using the235 TIS values for damage diameters ranging between 30 \u00b5m and236\n300 \u00b5m. These diameters corresponded to sizes where a decision237 about damage mitigation had to be made. Measuring diameters238 by TIS led to correct estimations of the true size of damage.239 It is worth noting that the 95% prediction interval (P.I.) was240 \u00b1 68 \u00b5m. The 95% P.I. is an estimate of an interval in which241 a future diameter estimation will fall with a 95% probability.242 Diameter estimations by TIS were accurate up to damage sizes of243 200 \u00b5m, which indicates that it is a convenient way of monitoring244 damage initiation and early growth.\n245 A large scatter of TIS over one decade was observed for iden-246 tical damage sizes in the current LMJ configuration of lighting247 and acquisition systems, either by measurement or by simula-248 tion. This scatter is related to the light energy received by the249 damage sites depending on their position on the vacuum win-250 dow (Figure 3), mainly due to nonuniform light distribution on251 the damaged face of the vacuum window induced by the twin252 LED system (Figure 1). These results indicate that the current253 lighting system itself was not sufficient to provide an invariant254 TIS measurement according to the damage site position on the255 vacuum window. However, diameter was measured accurately256 by coupling measured TIS for a damage site and its position257 on the optical component using the proposed model and sim-258 ulations. Despite taking into account the TIS and the position259 of the damage sites, differences in light scattering between 2260 sites of the same size induced an uncertainty on the size mea-261 surement (\u00b1 68 \u00b5m for true diameters varying between 30 \u00b5m262 and 300 \u00b5m). The value \u00b1 68 \u00b5m was due to the technique of263 measuring diameters from TIS and the quality of the lighting sys-264 tem, not the calibration method. It was thus demonstrated that265 model-based calibrations achieved the same accuracy as in-situ266 measurement-based calibration but at a lower operational costs267 for laser facilities. The scatter of diameter estimation for iden-268 tical true diameters may also be due to differences in damage269 morphology involving differences in light scattering.270\nBeyond the current system modeling, the proposed approach271 allows modifications of lighting or image acquisition systems272 to be virtually tested and evaluated, be it at LMJ, NIF, or SG-273 III facilities, or any other installation interested in accurately274 monitoring damage growth by acquiring light scattering signals.275\nA model was proposed to simulate the TIS to quantify the276 size of laser-induced damage sites on fused silica optics of high277 energy laser facilities. The model was based on three steps,278\nnamely, (i) lighting system modeling using a ray tracing soft-279 ware, (ii) measurements of light scattering by damage sites, and280 (iii) numerical imaging system modeling. The TIS simulations281 using the proposed model were calibrated and validated on282 an acquired image that contained 930 damage sites whose size283 was precisely measured using an optical microscope before the284 component was mounted on the facility. The measured TIS on285 the acquired image proved that the LMJ lighting system itself286 was not sufficient to measure accurately damage sizes with TIS287 alone. It was evidenced that model-based calibration achieved288 the same accuracy as in-situ measurement-based calibration but289 at a significantly lower operational costs for laser facilities.290 The proposed model is currently used to virtually test system291 modifications in order to improve damage size measurements.292 Although the paper focused on the damage monitoring sys-293 tem of LMJ, the proposed approach may be utilized to model294 and simulate the performance of other systems based on the295 measurement of light scattering signals. Using such model, time-296 consuming online measurements were avoided to calibrate TIS297 levels with the size of scattering objects (such as damage sites).298\nAcknowledgments.
