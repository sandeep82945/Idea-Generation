OO is the third most common benign bone lesion [1]. OO has a typical image on computed tomography (CT), and it has been reported that CT sensitivity specificity is higher compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [2, 3]. In MRI, it has been reported that dynamic series are superior to CT for diagnosis in OOs that do not show typical localizations, especially by rapidly recognizing nidus in atypical localizations [2].\n*Correspondence: Abdullah Soydan Mahmuto\u011flu asmahmutoglu@gmail.com 1Department of Radiology, \u0130stanbul Training and Research Hospital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey 2Department of Radiology, Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey 3Department of Radiology, \u015ei\u015fli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital, \u0130stanbul, Turkey\nMaterials and methods A total of consecutive 40 patients with osteoid osteoma were prospectively evaluated and treated with CT-guided RFA. Before and the post ablation the visual analog scale (VAS) and use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) were compared.\nResults Post-ablation VAS of the patients at the 1st week and 3rd month after the procedure decreased significantly (p < 0.01) compared to the pre-ablation. The frequency of NSAID use after the ablation decreased significantly (p < 0.01) compared to the pre-ablation time. The pre-procedure NSAID use of our patients included in the study was average 6.93 per week, the NSAID use in the 3rd month post-procedure controls was average 0.53 per week. Recurrence was detected in 4 of our patients, 36 patients had complete recovery.\nConclusion Radiofrequency ablation is an effective treatment method in the management of osteoid osteomas. Radiofrequency ablation has low recurrence rates and provides rapid regression in patients\u2019 pain after treatment.\nCT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is among the thermal ablative procedures and provides quick and reliable imaging. It provides great benefits with a minimally invasive procedure in locations that are not easily accessible, such as the femoral neck or intraarticular [4]. In CT-guided RFA, the recurrence rate is 5%, but the postoperative complication rate is much lower compared to surgery and the success rate is high [5, 6]. As the high frequency alternating current passes through the tissues, it loses energy by radiating heat, and this thermal energy causes ablation and necrosis within the tissues. Since there is no simultaneous visualization for complete removal of the nidus during surgery, a significant amount of bone tissue can be removed, which may cause bone weakness and the need for bone grafting. Despite all this effort, surgical recurrence rates are not very low due to the difficulties in the complete removal of the nidus, and it has been reported in recent studies that the recurrence rate after surgery ranges from 4.5 to 25% [5].\nIn this prospective study, we aimed to reveal the significance of a multidisciplinary method in reducing the recurrence and complications in OO patients with CTguided RFA performed by a team of experts in the field."

Patients were assessed on multimodality images (x-ray, CT and MRI). The procedures were performed by an interventional radiologist with 7-years of experienced in ablation and interventional procedures(M.K.).\nPatients whose nidus can be seen on CT, lesions which are not located superficially close to the skin, are not located very close to nerve roots and important vascular structures, patients who can receive anesthesia, do not have active infection in the area to be entered percutaneously for treatment, meet the criteria of INR < 1.3, platelet count < 50,000, and have not hemophilia, who did not have diseases that would cause bleeding diathesis were included in our study. Lesions larger than 15\u00a0mm, pregnant patients and patients with fractures were excluded from our study. Three patients who did not meet our inclusion criteria were excluded from our study and referred for surgery.\nIn the detailed anamnesis of the patients, the number of times a week they used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and the scores they gave to their pain according to the visual analog scale (VAS) were noted. After the procedure, the average number of times a week they used NSAIDs and the scores they gave for their pain in the first week and third month were noted according to the typical numerical pain scale of the VAS.\nThe VAS was used to evaluate pain scoring [7]. Numbers 0\u201310 were written on the horizontal line. 0 is account for no pain, 10 is account for excruciating pain. For the value to be measured, the patient was asked to mark the point felt and thought. According to this system, a pain score of 7 and above corresponded to severe pain."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "RFA is accepted as the gold standard because it creates a quick and practical treatment opportunity for OO. And for this reason, there are many studies investigating the success of OO treatment [9]. The complete disappearance of pain for 2 years in patients undergoing RFA is considered a cure [10]. And this success rate reaches almost 95% [9]. However, residual pain is not always due to unsuccessful nidus ablation, it can also be seen due to incorrect position of the needle, damage of adjacent soft tissues [9, 11]. Unfortunately, in large lesions, the needle must be positioned more than once and interventions at different angles are required. In our study, the nidus diameter was 10\u00a0 mm in our patient who had significant pain after the procedure. Recurrence was detected in other patients who had pain after the procedure. Vanderschueren et al. [12] found that lower age can prodispose a risk for lower recurrence. Baal et al. [13] reported that recurrence is more frequently seen in patients with younger age, females, broad lesions and located in eccentric places. And they found combination of conditions at highest risk for recurrence is female patient and the eccentric locations. Differently from this, half of the patients with recurrence in our patients were women, and recurrence was observed in typical localizations.

In our study, unlike previous studies, it was observed that there was no significant relationship between recurrence and age, gender, location and many factors. However, although we commented that the difference in recurrence rates between studies was due to operator dependency, interobserver variability was not examined in our study. This still remains an unanswered research issue.\nOsteoblastomas tend to be larger in size compared to OOs and involve atypical localizations such as the axial skeleton [14]. G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fta\u015f et al. [15] reported that the most important problem in the management of OOs located in abnormal locations is establish an appropriate diagnosis. Perhaps one of the reasons why recurrence was more\ncommon in atypically located; small osteoblastomas were mistaken for OO. In atypical locations, it may be difficult to reach the nidus because of the excessive thickening of the cortex as a result of the periosteal reaction and the formation of sclerosis in the medullary canal [9]. In such cases with excessive thickening of the cortex, it is impossible to reach the nidus by hammering, but this number is fortunately reltively small. In our study, hammering was not sufficient in only 4 patients and drilling with a battery-powered tool was used. We mostly prefer hammering since there are no danger for the thermal damage and soft tissue invagination.\nRFA is a nearly perfect minimally invasive method for OO, it has some potential complications. These complications were much less frequent compared to surgery, and it was reported as 0.9% in a large series of 557 patients\ntreated [16]. The skin burn, neural injury, bleeding and infection are among these reported complications. Neural injury can be seen more often as a complication in spinal and metacarpal localized OOs. In order to prevent neural injury, it is recommended to place the electrodes at least 1\u00a0cm away from the main neural networks [10]. Oc et al. [17] conducted a study showing the major and minor complications of RFA. They reported that complications occurred mostly in lesions located on the tibia.These complications were second-degree burns, superficial skin infection, the probe tip was broken and remained within the bone, intramuscular hematoma and numbness in the fingers developed in a lesion located in the metacarpus.\nThere is no detemined follow-up program after RFA treatment. however, we called our patients for check-ups in the 1st week and 3rd month after the procedure and followed them for 1 year. In the follow-ups, the decrease in size or disappearance of the nidus is examined with CT control.Erba\u015f et reported in a study there is no significant difference on imaging findings between follow-up periods. And they argued that single dynamic contrastenhanced MRI should be taken within the first 3 months after treatment in the group of patients whose pain completely disappeared during follow-ups due to lack of ionizing radiation. No algorithm has been established for the\nfollow-up intervals after RFA treatment, and an ablation technique that must be strictly followed has not been determined. Some researchers recommend direct overheating at 90\u00a0\u00b0C by passing the initial phase in which the electrodes are heated, and then lowering the temperature and recommending 2\u00a0min plateau at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Thus, the total intervention time will be over 15\u00a0 min [18, 19]. Another treatment algorithm was 90\u00a0 \u00b0C RFA for 2\u00a0min. The success of each of these techniques was over 90% [20].In our study, the burning process is applied at 100 degrees for 4\u20136\u00a0min.\n59% of the authors did not use any post-procedure analgesic while the remainder prescribe oral analgesic medication to their patients after the procedure [21].G\u00fclen\u00e7 et al. [22] found in their sudy, the mean duration of pain was 9.9 days, which was a short time period. They reported that the most important reason for the duration of the pain to be so short is to perform the interventional procedure with appropriate technique and manual dexterity. In our study, post-ablation VAS of the patients at the 1st week and 3rd month after the procedure decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared to the pre-ablation. The frequency of NSAID use after the ablation decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared to the pre-ablation time. Lesions with atypical clinical findings, localization, or imaging findings require biopsy\nto exclude malignant tumors such as osteoblastoma. In addition, Brodie\u2019s abscess, some fracture and hemangioma can mimic OO [22].Laredo et al. [23]. conducted a study using two different types of needles (11, 12.5 and 14 gauge cannula) and the success rate of biopsy is varying between 66.1 and 81.4%. However, they reported that a significant number of biopsies resulted in nondiagnostic results regardless of needle and operator technique.\nRosenthal et al. [24] reported that 27% of their results were nondiagnostic. Soliman et al. [25] found that 48% of patients were non diagnostic. However, the lesions of these patients with unsatisfactory results were treated with RFA, suggesting that non-diagnostic biopsies are most likely to be OO [23]. Another view is that the reason for the negative biopsy result is insufficient material to be obtained or inappropriate pathological sections taken. In studies, it has been reported that the success of treatment is similar and at a high rate in patients with nondiagnostic biopsy results [22].\nThere were some limitations in our study. The first was relatively small sample size. Another limitation was that interobserver variability was not examined. In addition, biopsy was not taken from the lesions before the procedure, which was the main limitation of our study, however, most of our patients were cured. Future studies examining large sample sizes and evaluating interobserver variability will contribute to the literature. In addition, it may be beneficial to conduct new studies that include MRI, which is superior to CT in dynamic series.\nIn conclusion: RFA is an effective treatment method that provides a high rate of treatment success with minimal procedures in the treatment of OO. And the recurrence rate is low. With RFA treatment, the patient is discharged quickly and there is a significant regression in pain.\nAcknowledgements Not applicable.\nAuthor contributions F.Z.A. wrote the main manuscript text and M.S.\u00c7. and M.K. prepared figures and examined the patients.
