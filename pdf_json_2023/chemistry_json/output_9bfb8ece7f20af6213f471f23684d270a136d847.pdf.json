KM33 is an anti\u2013 C1 domain antibody inhibitor previously isolated from a patient with severe hemophilia A. In addition to potently blocking FVIII binding to von Willebrand factor and phospholipid surfaces, KM33 disrupts FVIII binding to lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which drives FVIII hepatic clearance and antigen presentation in dendritic cells. Here, we report on the structure of FVIII bound to NB33, a recombinant derivative of KM33, via single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Structural analysis revealed that the NB33 epitope localizes to the FVIII residues R2090-S2094 and I2158-R2159, which constitute membrane-binding loops in the C1 domain. Further analysis revealed that multiple FVIII lysine and arginine residues, previously shown to mediate binding to\n2625/blood_bld LRP1, dock onto an acidic cleft at the NB33 variable domain interface, thus blocking a putative LRP1 binding site. Together, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism of FVIII inhibition by a patient-derived antibody inhibitor and provide structural evidence for engineering FVIII with reduced LRP1\u2013mediated clearance.\n-202 3-020181-m ain.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024"

            "text": "Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder afflicting 1 in 4065 male births worldwide and is characterized by defective or deficient coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), leading to uncontrolled bleeding events.1 The formation of pathogenic antibody inhibitors against FVIII occurs in 30% of patients with congenital hemophilia A receiving FVIII replacement therapy as well as in all cases of acquired hemophilia A.2 Most of the characterized antibody inhibitors target the A2, C1, and C2 domains of FVIII and disrupt coagulation mechanistically. Anti\u2013 C1 domain inhibitor antibodies can block FVIII binding to von Willebrand factor (VWF) and phospholipid surfaces, resulting in premature proteolytic degradation, clearance of FVIII, and/or impeding access to membrane surfaces, in which activated FVIII serves to nucleate the intrinsic tenase complex. KM33, a group AB anti\u2013C1 domain antibody inhibitor was previously isolated from a patient with severe hemophilia A who presented with multiple inhibitor antibodies.3 In addition to potently inhibiting FVIII binding to VWF and phospholipid membranes, KM33 has the novel property of blocking the FVIII endocytosis by dendritic cells, which regulates the hepatic clearance of FVIII and antigen presentation.4,5 Studies incorporating site-directed\nmutagenesis with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and live cell microscopy as well as hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) have localized the KM33 epitope to several membrane-binding spikes in the C1 domain.5-11 To identify the amino acids that make up the KM33 epitope, this study reports on the structure of ET3i, a bioengineered human/ porcine FVIII chimera, bound to a Fab fragment of NB33, a recombinant immunoglobulin G derivative of KM33, by singleparticle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)."

The ET3i A domains vary in local resolution, whereas the C2 domain has suboptimal resolution owing to its flexibility but sufficient density for complete model building. No large-scale conformational rearrangements of the C domains were observed as previously described.15,16\nThe ET3i:NB33 interface, which exhibits a local resolution of ~3.5 to 4 \u00c5 (supplemental Figure 2C), is stabilized by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with a buried surface area of 822 \u00c52.

NB33 residue Y32 in the VH domain forms a hydrogen bond with FVIII residue R2090, in addition to hydrophobic interactions with residue F2093 (Figure 1D). These results are consistent with prior SPR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data, demonstrating that the FVIII R2090A/K2092A/F2093A triple variant abrogated binding to KM33.8 The cryo-EM structure of\nSTRUCTURE OF A FVIII/ANTI\u2013C1 AB INHIBITOR COMPLEX\nBIVV001, a bioengineered extended half-life therapeutic FVIII fused to the VWF D\u2032D3 domains, helped identify interactions between FVIII residues K2092 and F2093 and the D3 domain, supporting the obstruction of VWF binding as an inhibitory mechanism by KM33.5,18 Additional contacts were present between FVIII residues I2158-R2159 and the CDR3 loop of the NB33 VH domain (Figure 1E).

LRP1 uses clusters of extracellular complement-type repeat domains to bind and endocytose a wide variety of ligands, including FVIII, for processing and antigen presentation to T cells.20 Ligand binding to LRP1 occurs through a conserved acidic patch and an aromatic residue in the complement-type repeat domains, which target ligands carrying surface-exposed positively charged residues.21,22 The binding of LRP1 to FVIII is predicted to rely on an array of surface-exposed lysine residues on the FVIII light chain in a charge-dependent manner.10 Further studies have suggested a partial overlap between the LRP1 binding region and KM33 epitope.5,7,8,23 Our structural analysis of ET3i:NB33 was consistent with these experiments, revealing that residues K2065, R2090, K2092, and R2159 docked onto a patch of acidic NB33 residues, thus blocking the putative LRP1 binding region (Figure 2B-C). These positively charged FVIII residues have previously been shown to bind to VWF and/or phospholipid membranes, supporting the inhibitory mechanism of KM33 disruption of VWF and phospholipid interactions (supplemental\nTable 2).6,11,17,18 Intriguingly, NB33 appears to mimic the predicted LRP1 binding site using an aliphatic paratope to target positively charged FVIII residues and neighboring hydrophobic residues. These results provide structural evidence for the mechanism of FVIII clearance by LRP1 and suggest that mutating positively charged FVIII residues in the C1 domain can reduce hepatic clearance rates.\nThe structure of the C1 domain bound to NB33 bears resemblance to the crystal structure of the isolated C2 domain bound to BO2C11, a patient-derived anti\u2013C2 domain antibody inhibitor that forms multiple salt bridges with FVIII residues R2215 and R2220 (supplemental Figure 4).24 Both antibodies target several \u03b2-hairpin loops and disrupt FVIII binding to VWF and phospholipid membranes, although the BO2C11 epitope was significantly more aliphatic than the electropositive KM33 epitope. In addition, the FVIII C1 domain forms extensive interactions with the VWF D\u2032D3 domains in contrast to the C2 domain.18 Uptake of FVIII by monocyte-derived dendritic cells was blocked in the presence of BO2C11 or KM33 antibodies.25\n200 13 JULY 2023 | VOLUME 142, NUMBER 2\nFurthermore, the exposure of FVIII\u2013/\u2013 mice to recombinant FVIII preincubated with BO2C11 or KM33 diminished the host immune response.7,25 Similar results were observed using a recombinant FVIII R2090A/K2092A/F2093A triple variant in the absence of antibodies, presumably because of the impaired binding to LRP1; however, the FVIII R2215A/R2220A double variant on the C2 domain showed no measurable effect on diminishing the immune response.8,25 Indeed, previous SPR studies have demonstrated that the C2 domain has no affinity for LRP1, suggesting that the BO2C11 antibody may indirectly block LRP1 binding through steric interference or overlap with the binding region for a non-LRP1 endocytic receptor.11 Although inhibitor development is a rare occurrence in cases of mild/moderate hemophilia A, our structural analysis may also indicate that certain missense mutations in the C1 domain may promote FVIII binding to LRP1 and induce an immune response.26 Together, these results suggest differential roles for positively charged residues in the C domains in driving LRP1mediated FVIII endocytosis and immunogenicity.\nIn summary, the ET3i:NB33 structure represents the first structural analysis of a complex of a therapeutically active FVIII construct bound to a patient-derived pathogenic inhibitory antibody. Our structural analysis delineates the role of surfaceexposed, positively charged residues on the C1 domain in binding to KM33, which disrupts the endocytosis of FVIII by dendritic cells. Fundamental questions concerning FVIII clearance require further investigation, including the role of non-LRP1 endocytic receptors, such as macrophage mannose receptors, which are unaffected by KM33-bound FVIII.7 These findings are critical for therapeutic strategies for designing a recombinant FVIII molecule with an extended half-life, reduced immunogenicity, and decreased clearance by dendritic cells (Figure 2D)."
