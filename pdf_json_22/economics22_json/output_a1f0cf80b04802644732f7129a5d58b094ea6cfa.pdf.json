    "abstractText": "With the acceleration of urbanization, domestic waste has become one of the most inevitable factors threatening the environment and human health. Waste classification is of great significance and value for improving urban environmental quality and promoting human well-being. Based on the theory of planned behavior, we added external and socio-economic factors to systematically examine how they affect residents\u2019 waste classification behavior (WCB). We collected 661 valid data through a questionnaire survey conducted in Jinan, a pilot city for waste classification in China. Key driving factors were identified by combining binary logistic regression and the principal component analysis. The results showed that the elderly, women, and people with higher education are more likely to participate in waste classification. Attitude, collaborative governance, and institutional pressure positively affect WCB, while subjective norm and infrastructure have a negative effect. Knowledge mastery and degree of publicity are positively and significantly related to WCB, but other perceived behavioral control subvariables negatively affect WCB. Based on the results and status of waste classification in Jinan, we propose the multi-agent linkage governance pattern from various dimensions to explore a powerful guiding incentive that can enhance WCB and provide a reference for waste management policymakers.",

            "text": "With the rapid development of the world\u2019s economy and urbanization, the amount of municipal solid waste produced has increased dramatically in recent years. According to a World Bank report, the world was estimated to generate solid waste increase by 73% from 2.24 billion tons in 2020 to 3.4 billion tons in 2050 (World Bank 2022). The improper processing of solid waste separation and management, including uncontrolled waste recycling (Lin et\u00a0al. 2022) and the open burning of waste (Ferronato and Torretta 2019), threatens human health and the environment (Odonkor and Sallar 2021; Hu and He 2022). Especially since the outbreak of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, essential public health has faced great challenges. The demand for facemasks, gloves, and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits generates a huge amount of healthcare waste that may contribute to virus contamination, which may also lead to health hazards for trash collection workers and waste management (Ranjbari et\u00a0al. 2022). The negative impact of solid waste has become a global sustainable development issue. Various sectors of society need to learn to cope with waste pollution and waste management to address global environmental problems (Esmaeilian et\u00a0al. 2018).\nChina is facing serious waste disposal and management issues. Its municipal solid waste reached 234.52 million tons by the end of 2020, while the total amount of urban waste is still increasing at an annual rate of 8\u201310%, and more than two-thirds of the cities face the dilemma of a \u201cwaste siege\u201d (Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development of China 2020). In response to the rapid growth in waste generation, the Chinese government has made many attempts to classify waste. As early as 2000, China launched waste Responsible Editor: Philippe Garrigues * Yu Cheng 614058@sdnu.edu.cn 1 College of\u00a0Geography and\u00a0Environment, Shandong Normal University, Jinan\u00a0250358, China\n1 3\nsource-separated collection policies in eight pilot cities (e.g., Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou), collecting municipal solid waste using four different labeled containers (Zhang and Wang 2020). However, the implementation effects in those cities showed a poor performance (Tai et\u00a0al. 2011). In 2018, Shanghai was selected as the first pilot city for waste classification. Then, 46 key cities were added to the pilot to carry out its implementation, including Jinan, Qingdao, and Taian in Shandong Province. As the second most populated and the third-largest economy in China, Shandong Province has faced severe resource pressure and environmental pollution as a result of prolonged rapid urbanization and prosperous economic development (Chen et\u00a0al. 2022). In 2020, Shandong also ranked as the third major wasteproducing province in China as its waste removal reached 16.74 million tons (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2021). Jinan plays a leading showcase role as the capital of Shandong Province and waste classification pilot city and has implemented a large-scale waste classification policy (Liu et\u00a0al. 2022). Although residents in Jinan have begun to pay attention to waste classification, many problems hinder them from engaging in waste sorting, including a long-term lack of relevant education and a sound waste classification system. These problems are prevalent in other waste classification pilot cities (Zou et\u00a0al. 2019). Therefore, a more nuanced understanding of barriers and dilemmas to sorting waste in China is warranted and Jinan city offers an important case to investigate the affecting factors of community residents engaged in waste classification.\nEnhancing the effect of waste classification requires a deeper understanding of constraints affecting such behavior. Many scholars tried to focus on the psychological determinants of residents\u2019 WCB. From the perspective of individual willingness and behavior, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention factors significantly affect WCB (Akulume and Kiwanuka 2016; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2015, 2022). Some researchers indicate that residents\u2019 grasp of classification knowledge contributes to their willingness to participate in waste classification (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021). Similarly, perceived difficulty and convenience of waste classification have been proven to play a prominent role in classification intention in recent years (Cudjoe et\u00a0al. 2020; Cheng et\u00a0al. 2022). Scholars also consider socio-economic characteristics as key drivers behind the behavioral change in waste classification. Setiawan (2020) found that education level determined the public receptivity regarding waste classification. In addition, age (Pakpour et\u00a0al. 2014), gender (Shen et\u00a0al. 2019), and income (Jia et\u00a0al. 2021) have gradually been confirmed to have an important impact on individuals engaging in waste classifications. Scholars generally use the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and its extended model to investigate the relationship between classification intention and behavior (Wang et\u00a0al. 2021). Besides, scholars\nalso combine TPB theory and other psychological models (e.g., antecedent-belief-consequence theory and norm activation model) to investigate the influence of internal and external conditions on behavioral intentions and behaviors (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021; Goh et\u00a0al. 2022).\nHowever, classification behavior deviates from intention to some extent in practice. Research points out that residents are often willing to participate in waste classification, while few of them actually act on it (Wang et\u00a0al. 2020). An increasing number of scholars have begun to focus on the impact of external factors and incentive methods on WCB (Meng et\u00a0al. 2019; Peng et\u00a0al. 2021; Wang et\u00a0al. 2019). Ekere et\u00a0al. (2009) found that peer influence efficiently explained the probability of waste utilization and separation behavior. Tian et\u00a0al. (2019) used structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression and found that governments publicizing waste classification knowledge can effectively help implement waste classification in China. Tang et\u00a0al. (2022) claimed that reward and punishment policies and supporting facilities significantly stimulate and promote WCB, and the implementation of publicity and education activities are conducive to more easily helping residents accept waste classification. Besides, the availability and convenience of infrastructure are also important to interpret and predict WCB (Chen and Gao 2020; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2019). The study of Rousta et\u00a0al. (2015) demonstrated that shortening the distance to the drop-off points significantly improved the source sorting of household waste. Wang et\u00a0al. (2018) confirmed that good facility conditions can significantly promote individuals to separate waste.\nAlthough previous studies have identified some external factors that can influence residents\u2019 WCB, there are still many weaknesses and gaps in place. Most of them used a single or several variables to measure the influencing factors, failing to explore in depth the multi-dimensional impact on WCB. In terms of incentive measures, existing research hardly considers the joint governance impact of multiple responsible subjects such as government, communities, and enterprises, making it difficult to establish a long-term incentive mechanism. To avoid the defects of single-perspective research, we considered both the internal factors of the behavior subject and the external environment in the TBP analysis framework and selected 7 factors and 24 sub-variables to better understand the intention-behavior transformation process by binary logistic regression. We discussed the implementation path of waste classification from the perspective of multiple-responsible subjects and constructed a community waste classification and management pattern covering publicity guidance, technical support, and system guarantee. Finally, sensible suggestions for a waste classification system are put forward.\nOur study makes the following contributions. First, we extended the TPB to consider the effect of external\nincentives and internal characteristics on WCB and use sub-variables to elucidate the influence mechanism from the community scale. Second, we identified driving factors by combining binary logistic regression and principal components analysis (PCA), which enriches research methods for waste classification. Third, based on the status of waste classification and analysis of an incentive pattern from a multi-cognitive perspective, we innovatively proposed the Multi-agent Linkage Governance Pattern for making an effort to promote waste classification policy.\nThe remainder of this study is organized as follows: \u201cResearch hypothesis\u201d presents the theoretical framework and research hypothesis; \u201cResearch Methods\u201d describes the research methods and data collections; \u201cData analysis and results\u201d presents the analysis results; \u201cDiscussion and policy suggestions\u201d includes discussions and policy implications; the last section provides conclusions."

The factors that affect individuals\u2019 behavioral intention can be divided into three categories: attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. The attitude toward behavior refers to residents\u2019 positive or negative evaluation of a particular behavior\u2019s contribution (Razali et\u00a0al. 2020). A subjective norm relates to the fact that people perceive social pressure from relatives, friends, and other social groups who are important to them thereby performing the\nexpected behaviors. Perceived behavioral control reflects expected barriers in participants\u2019 actual behavior. Previous studies have confirmed that TPB not only predicts individual WCB through the intention channel but also can take other influencing factors into account to improve explanatory power according to a specific research context (Fan et\u00a0al. 2019; Govindan et\u00a0al. 2022). Based on the actual situation and the implemented policies of waste classification in Jinan, we additionally selected four factors\u2014basic personal information, collaborative governance, infrastructure, and institutional pressure\u2014to initially construct the WCB conceptual hypothesis model (Fig.\u00a01).

Increasingly, research has gradually confirmed that some socioeconomic drivers can significantly affect the tendency of WCB. Afroz et\u00a0al. (2009) revealed that people who are well educated and have high incomes are more willing to pay for waste management. Adzawla et\u00a0al. (2019) found that socioeconomic factors such as education, regional location, and per capita income are important in determining a household\u2019s waste disposal system. In most households, solid waste management is run by women. More females than males are involved in pro-environmental activities such as waste recycling and classification (L\u00f3pez-Bonilla et\u00a0 al. 2020). However, variability in the distribution of\n1 3\nrespondents can affect the final results. Oskamp et\u00a0al. (1991) found that education level and gender are not correlated with waste recycling, while people who earn more money were more likely to participate in waste recycling than those who made less.\nThis study selected gender, age, monthly income, and education level to represent the basic personal information of the respondents and analyzed the relationship between basic personal information and WCB. The proposed hypotheses are as follows:\nH1. Residents\u2019 basic personal information is related to WCB. H1a. Women are more likely to be involved in waste classification. H1b. Seniors are more willing to sort their waste. H1c. People with higher monthly income and education are easier to be involved in waste classification."

Subjective norm refers to an individual\u2019s perception of social pressure from the surrounding people or groups to believe that he/she should or should not engage in certain behavior. Residents\u2019 trust in waste classification is affected by the attitudes of their neighbors, family, government, and media. Individuals who gain social approval\nand respect from waste classification will tend to engage in it (Negash et\u00a0al. 2021). Typically, individuals living in a community that confers great importance to the environment will tend to engage in conservation activities to be consistent with group beliefs and rules. However, communities with a high prevalence of greenness may reduce well-being under the weight of conformity pressure (Binder et\u00a0al. 2020). To a certain extent, low well-being perception will make residents tired of participating in garbage sorting, thus hindering the formation of a good green environment in the community. In addition, failure to adequately establish waste sourceseparated collection to support strong moral norms also can lead individuals to believe that their classification behavior will not be susceptible to social pressure (Ma et\u00a0al. 2018). Thus, subjective norm will not significantly interfere with residents\u2019 participation in waste classification.\nIn this study, three variables, attitude toward others, public pressure, and peer effect, were used to characterize subjective norm. We assume that the attitude of others, public pressure, and peer effect from communities will influence individual participation in waste classification. The hypothesis is as follows:\nH3.

However, this effect is also affected by the subjective perception of accessibility of infrastructure. Residents keen on household waste classification will be restricted by the lack of effective and convenient facilities so they do not take actual action (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2019). Waste classification facilities take up a lot of time and space, especially complex ones to understand. When residents realize that inconvenient facilities can complicate their lives, their willingness to sort waste diminishes. Even if several classification facilities exist in the community, residents are reluctant to engage in waste classification. The lack of efficient and convenient recovery facilities is an important factor hindering China\u2019s waste recycling, which is considered as one of the key environmental constraints obstructing personal intentions to transform a certain recycling behavior (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2016).\nCommunity infrastructure can be characterized by five aspects: classification label, disposal distance, renewable resource recycling points, transportation, and end-of-pipe treatment.

In addition to mandatory policies, financial incentives can also motivate households to\nrecycle (Shaw and Maynard 2008). A point reward system can encourage customers to form environmental habits and effectively promote electronic waste recycling management systems (Zhong and Huang 2016).\nWe divided institutional pressure into four secondary variables: reward and punishment system, credit system, payas-you-throw policy, and laws.

Second, we regarded gender, age, education level, and monthly income as categorical variables, and the principal components as continuous variables. All the categorical and continuous variables were taken into consideration to explore the influence mechanism of WCB by logistic regression. Third, according to logistic regression results, coefficients of 20 explanatory variables were obtained by bringing the coefficients of four principal components into the principal component analysis equation.\nFour principal components were extracted based on the condition that the eigenvalue was greater than 1 and their cumulative variance contribution reached 67.55% (> 50%), indicating that the four extracted principal components explained 67.55% of the information from 20\nexplanatory variables. The 20 explanatory variables were then transformed into four principal component factors by the weighted evaluation method (Table\u00a03). According to the distribution of high loadings in this matrix, the first principal component includes four variables: reward and punishment system (x1), credit system (x2), pay-as-you-throw policy (x3), and laws (x4), which are all sub-variables of institutional pressure. The second principal component consists of attitude of others (x8), public pressure (x9), personal costs (x10), difficulty in separating waste (x11), peer effects (x12), disposal distance (x13), renewable resource recycling points (x14), and supervision effort (x15). These sub-variables can be divided into two categories: one is the classification cognition formed by public opinion and pressure from the external environment or suffering benefit losses, and the other is the construction of external public infrastructure. The third principal component includes classification awareness (x16), knowledge mastery (x17), and degree of publicity (x18). The last principal component also has two parts: infrastructure and self-social cognition, involving end-of-pipe treatment (x5), transportation (x6), classification label (x7), self-efficacy (x19), and environmental responsibility (x20).\nAccording to the established PCA-logistic regression model, the regression coefficient was estimated using the IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 software. In Table\u00a04, the regression results show that gender, age, and education level significantly influenced residents\u2019 WCB (P < 0.001), while the monthly income had insignificant effects on residents\u2019 WCB\n1 3\nwith both P values greater than 0.1.

The coefficient of the fourth principal component significantly impacted WCB at the 5% level (P = 0.07). Specifically, education level and the third principal component had the highest coefficients at 1.40 and 1.28, respectively. Education and publicity can internalize waste classification knowledge into sorting awareness and ability, which helps residents to establish environmental consciousness and cultivate classification habits. In addition, the second principal component coefficient was negative, preliminarily indicating that social pressure, personal cost, and undeveloped infrastructure inhibit residents from engaging in waste classification.\nThe absolute value of the regression coefficient directly reflects the influence degree of the explanatory variable on the explained variable. A negative value indicates that the influencing factor has a hindering effect on WCB, while a positive value implies that this driver can promote WCB to some extent. Based on PCA and the results above, the coefficients of the influencing factors of WCB are shown in Table\u00a05."

The results show that the majority of residents in Jinan believe that subjective norm cannot change and intervene in their behavior to engage in waste classification. The community in Jinan has not yet formed a strong social atmosphere that is conducive to waste classification, in which normative function has not been fully exerted. When a community does not establish a good classification environment, subjective norm fails to make a positive effect on WCB and residents tend to be reluctant to separate the\nVariables B S.F Wald df Sig Exp (B)\n1 3\ndomestic waste because it is time consuming and labor intensive."

            "text": "According to this analysis, the elderly, women, and people with higher education are more likely to engage in waste classification. It confirms that basic personal information has explanatory power for WCB (Han et\u00a0al. 2019). Influenced by traditional Chinese social customs, the elderly and women are the main bearers of household waste classification and recycling. In comparison, highly educated people are more likely to be exposed to information about waste classification and, thus, their intentions and behavior can be influenced more easily. Considering monthly income, we found that it is insignificantly related to WCB. This result might be attributed to the waste classification background in China. Before the pilot was proposed in Jinan in 2018, community residents had little command of waste classification. The potential impact of monthly income cannot be demonstrated in the short term. Moreover, the total effect of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control are positive, indicating that these factors can enhance WCB (Liu et\u00a0al. 2019). However, two secondary variables of\n1 3\nperceived behavioral control\u2014personal costs and difficulty in separating waste\u2014negatively affect WCB. The influence coefficient of personal costs is lower than 0.005, which is relatively negligible. The higher the costs residents perceive, the less willing they are to sort waste. Besides, individuals may reduce the frequency of waste sorting when feeling difficulty in understanding the classification process. We further confirm that improving collaborative governance can enhance residents involved in waste classification. However, there is a research gap in the relationship between this factor and WCB. In addition, institutional pressure has a significant effect on WCB. Chen and Gao (2020) also observed that economic and policy incentives like subsidies are an important factor affecting residents\u2019 WCB. Some scholars confirmed that infrastructure is significantly correlated with WCB (Leeabai et\u00a0al. 2019; Peng et\u00a0al. 2021). In the case of Jinan, infrastructure negatively affects and significantly hinders WCB. Our investigation found that classification, recycling bins, and other facilities in Jinan communities are insufficient, and their spatial layout is inconvenient. Convenience and availability of facilities can strengthen recycling attitudes that determine an individual\u2019s recycling and WCB (Tonglet et\u00a0al. 2004a).\nThe relationships between driving factors and residents\u2019 WCB are shown in Fig.\u00a03. At its core, residents\u2019 waste sorting is the process of converting waste classification knowledge into classification behavior driven by classification\nintention. In our study, institutional pressures, publicity and education, infrastructure, and collaborative governance were identified as four important external conditions that stimulate classification motivation and improve classification ability. From a government perspective, institutional pressure can promote residents to sort waste, including enforcing classification and incentive rewards. This enforcing classification mainly relies on laws and sets corresponding penalties to form a self-regulating mechanism for residents to participate in waste classification, while incentive rewards create some enthusiasm among residents for waste classification, which, to some extent, converts classification intention into behavior. Whether it is to motivate residents to sort waste or to implement enforcement policies, the goal is to transition the public from an \u201cinaction\u201d state to an \u201caction\u201d state by cultivating classification awareness. However, while the majority of residents in Jinan have a certain awareness of waste classification, they still fail to form a classification habit. The reason is that they have little command of the current classification norms and methods and feel that waste classification is onerous and has a high personal cost. The survey results show that the overall identification rate of waste categories among residents in Jinan is only 7.22%. Therefore, education and publicity play an important role in improving classification knowledge (Knickmeyer 2020), and our study confirmed it through regression analysis. We find that education and publicity levels were positively related to\nFig. 3 Relationships between driving factors and residents\u2019 WCB\n1 3\nWCB. Education and publicity not only improve residents\u2019 ability to sort waste by themselves but also can effectively involve other residents in waste classification efforts through public pressure and the bandwagon effect, thereby forming an improved common environmental and classification ethos. Good community management can easily help individuals to build confidence and abilities to sort waste (Hu et\u00a0al. 2021). In the process of social advocacy and education, residents gain more knowledge and enhance self-efficacy and mutual supervision of waste classification. Moreover, infrastructure is an important component of garbage collection and disposal has a negative effect on WCB in the study results. It stems from residents distrusting poorly developed facilities and disposal systems. Residents often believe that even after careful sorting, household waste ends up mixed and transported together, which will take a lot of effort and increase the personal cost. According to our survey, most communities in Jinan are only equipped with standard 50-L green trash cans and lack smart trash cans, four-labeled containers, and renewable resource recycling points. Hence, improving sorting facilities and strengthening supervision at waste disposal points are critical for residents to participate in waste classification (Govindan et\u00a0al. 2022). In terms of collaborative governance, individuals, businesses, and NGOs voluntarily participating in public services play an important role in the waste sorting process (Lu and Sidortsov 2019). This kind of voluntary behavior can promote the formation of residents\u2019 classification habits and reduce the cost of maintaining and building infrastructure and is also conducive to the promotion of waste classification policies."

            "text": "According to the analysis of the WCB mechanism, residents engaging in waste classification are affected by various factors of public, society, and individuals. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the links and stakeholders in various factors when constructing the guidance and incentive mechanism for WCB. We investigated the current governance model of waste classification in Jinan and found that the local government and community residents are the main responsible subjects involved in waste classification. However, adopting an only-government-led model to manage waste classification puts too much pressure on the government. In addition, both residents as the behavior subjects and markets that play the role of resource allocation lack the enthusiasm to engage in waste classification. These blocks make it difficult for collaborative governance to form cohesion. To resolve the dilemma of residents\u2019 participation in waste sorting, it is essential to establish the relevant institutional system of multi-agent joint management of waste classification. In addition, there is a serious deviation between the waste classification willingness and\nthe actual behavior of residents in Jinan communities. The survey results show that while 96.83% of the respondents are willing to sort waste, only 21.3% have actually done it. According to the regression results, the incentive of external factors is an important connection point to realizing the transformation of residents\u2019 internal intention into classification behavior. Based on the above discussion, we explore the powerful guiding incentives to enhance residents\u2019 participation in waste classification from the perspective of community governance. The multi-agent linkage governance pattern is innovatively proposed covering three levels of publicity guidance, technical support, and system guarantee (Fig.\u00a04), and its specific strategies are divided into the following three dimensions.\nFirst, adopt a multi-guidance pattern to translate residents\u2019 classification willingness into practical actions. Based on the government\u2019s financial support, the community should be equipped with the infrastructure for waste classification collection and transportation. Residents\u2019 waste disposal in the community should be merged and regularly monitored. To overcome the disadvantages of manual sorting, the Internet of Things and big data can be used to collect and process information, analyze data, and monitor waste flow. In addition, there should be a waste classification publicity campaign and education mechanism that integrates households, schools, and communities to improve residents\u2019 classification awareness. Communities and schools should hold lectures that systematically popularize waste classification standards and operation flow and help to overcome its fragmented acceptance. Besides, the community should organize parent\u2013child activities to strengthen the connection between families and work together to promote waste classification. The sustainable operation of the guidance mechanism also depends on external environmental factors. Various community activities should be held to enhance residents\u2019 sense of responsibility and belonging in the process of promoting community integration, thereby forming a joint force of community governance to gradually regulate residents\u2019 behavior.\nSecond, use multi-dimensional incentives to apply external driving forces to waste classification. Through the alliance of communities, volunteers, and property management, link volunteer service with multiple social fields to realize the full potential of external incentives. Form the credit system of volunteer service time, which is related points to the extracurricular activities in primary and the graduation requirements of universities. Moreover, volunteer associations and insurance companies establish an insurance points mode, so that residents can obtain medical insurance, pension insurance, and other security. Residents can exchange pension funds after the age of 60 with their annual voluntary activities and accumulated points. Cooperation agreement between the government and credit reporting agencies to integrate waste classification\n1 3\ninto the credit reporting system and adopt appropriate incentives and penalties for residents with different credit ratings. Based on the credit score and the length of time of volunteers, society sets up the level of domestic waste disposal fees and implements the ladder fee system to improve residents\u2019 engagement through community management.\nThird, enhance the multi-layer supervision system to ensure the operation of the guidance and incentive mechanism. On the one hand, introduce the market regulation system to construct long-term operations contributing to the marketization and economic construction of waste classification. The market can achieve the purpose of recycling and reducing waste by adjusting the supply and demand of waste classification. Enterprises assist waste management and classification with the economic market to turn the waste disposal process into a complete industrial system. On the other hand, construct various information-sharing platforms to provide residents with channels for opinions and suggestions. These platforms can integrate information and timely feedback to government and communities to promote waste classification and management work and help form a new grassroots social governance pattern of co-construction, co-governance, and sharing."

Exploring the WCB and its driving forces is conducive to green and sustainable\ndevelopment. We selected seven communities in Jinan City of China and collected 661 valid questionnaires to analyze the current issue and influence mechanism of WCB. Based on previous research and the current situation in Jinan, we further extended the TPB and took internal factors and the external environment into consideration. Incorporating seven influencing factors and their secondary variables into the theoretical framework, we combined PCA and binary logistic regression to analyze the questionnaire\u2019s data. The main findings are summarized as follows.\nThe elder, women, and people with higher education are easier to engage in waste classification, while the monthly income insignificantly affected residents\u2019 WCB. Meanwhile, attitude, collaborative governance, and institutional pressure have a significantly positive effect on residents to classify household waste. However, subjective norm and infrastructure negatively affect this behavior. Two secondary variables\u2014knowledge mastery and degree of publicity in perceived behavioral control factor\u2014have a positive effect on WCB while other variables negatively influence WCB. Based on these results, we constructed the multi-agent linkage governance pattern to help transform residents\u2019 intentions into classification behavior with the combination of multi-stakeholders and external incentives.\nThis study identified the key factors affecting WCB and established an effective incentive mechanism, which provided a strong guarantee for implementing waste classification policies in Jinan. In future works, we will consider conducting comprehensive and comparative studies on different\n1 3\ntypes of cities from time scales and spatial dimensions based on this research, to further enrich our theoretical and policy framework. In addition, we will explore effective paths for establishing a dynamic tracking and feedback system to regularly evaluate the implementation performance of existing classification policies, and eliminate policies that impede the timely processing of waste classification and management. The final outcome will be a more replicable and popular waste classification management pattern with Chinese characteristics.\nAuthor contribution All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
