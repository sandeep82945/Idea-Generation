    "abstractText": "1,4\u2212naftoquinone (NQ) molecules have been extensively evaluated as potent antibacterial compounds; however, their use is limited, since they have low water solubility and exhibit toxicities in healthy eukaryotic cells. A possible path to overcoming these challenges is the use of particulate vehicles, such as SBA-15, which is a biocompatible and biodegradable mesoporous silica material, that may enhance drug delivery and decrease dosages. In this work, an isotherm model-based adsorption of three NQs into SBA-15 microparticles was evaluated. Interactions between NQs and SBA-15 microparticles were modeled at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory to understand the nature of such interactions. The results demonstrated that the adsorption of NQ, 2NQ, and 5NQ into SBA-15 fit the Freundlich adsorption model. According to theorical studies, physisorption is mediated by hydrogen bonds, while the most stable interactions occur between the carbonyl group of NQ and silica surfaces. Both experimental and theoretical results contribute to a deeper understanding of the use of SBA-15 or similar particles as nanovehicles in such a way that NQs can be modified in carbonyl or C3 to enhance adsorptions. The theoretical and experimental results were in accordance and contribute to a deeper understanding of how interactions between NQ-type molecules and SiO2 materials occur.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance is a global health problem declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as among the top 10 global public health threats. WHO indicated in 2019 that 25 countries had reported bloodstream infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and 49 countries provided data on bloodstream infections due to Escherichia coli resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. Moreover, antibiotic-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains limit the treatment of the global tuberculosis epidemic [1]. While the development of new molecules with potential antimicrobial action is slow, the rate of resistance development is always greater. Of the antibiotic-resistant pathogens listed by WHO, only 32 had been tested by 2019, and only 6 were considered innovative. The search for novel antibiotics considers the isolation and chemical modification of secondary metabolites from natural sources, such as 1,4\u2212naphthoquinones (NQs). Our research group has been working extensively on synthesizing novel naphthoquinone derivatives as potential\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1464. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15121464 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1464 2 of 18\nantitumoral and antibiotic drugs. A quinone molecule derived from a naphthalene ring, 1,4\u2212naphthoquinone (NQ), exhibits antimicrobial [2\u20134], antifungal [5], antioxidant [6\u20138], and antitumor activities [9\u201311]. NQs and several derivatives have been isolated from plants, fungi, and animals, and they induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by redox reactions, which are related to the antibacterial effect against prokaryotic [12] and eukaryotic cells and can trigger apoptosis in tumor cell lines via ROS-modulated signaling pathways [13,14]. However, NQ derivatives possess low solubility in water and they may induce toxic effects in animals [15], and for that reason, using nanomaterials and micromaterials as drug-delivery vehicles can overcome solubility and toxicity problems. The use of nanomaterials and micromaterials offers advantages, such as the protection of drug degradation in living organisms, higher affinities for the drug target site, greater surface area to increase the number of drug molecules onto the vehicle, and potential contributions to synergistic effects [16,17]. Among several materials, mesoporous silica (SiO2) particles, such as SBA-15, have been widely studied as drug-delivery vehicles, taking advantage of their large specific surface area, the ease of modifying their chemical nature, and their high biocompatibility and biodegradability [18\u201322]. SBA-15 (Santa Barbara amorphous) particles were first obtained by Zhao et al., who reported a material with twodimensional well-ordered hexagonal structures, large pores, and large surface areas [23]. In the last two decades, the biological applications of SBA-15 focused on drug delivery [24,25], vaccine platforms [26,27], and tissue engineering [28,29] among other applications. Interactions between SiO2 materials and organic molecules of biological interest have been studied using different computational chemistry techniques ranging from modeling realistic molecular systems to the energy involved in the interaction. In this sense, some authors proposed molecular modeling methodologies that allow obtaining, in the first instance, realistic models of SiO2. For example, in their work, Ugliengo et al. (2008) proposed the construction of surface models for amorphous silica, starting from the dimensional replication of a unit cell of alpha cristobalite and subsequent saturations with hydroxyl groups [30]. On the other hand, the density functional theory (DFT) allows us to study and evaluate molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and their associative energies, both for molecules of biological interest [31] and nanomaterials, with an adequate level of chemical precision [32]. Moreover, the combination of DFT and other methodologies, such as the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) [33], has allowed the estimation of the energy of H-bonds [34]. These methodologies have been used to study interactions between SiO2 materials and anticancer drugs [35,36], such antibiotics as ampicillin [37] and \u03b21-receptor blockers [38], as well as other supports used in drug delivery, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) xerogels [39] and chitosan [40]. Currently, there is limited information on drug molecule interactions with mesoporous silica particles. Nonetheless, the understanding of the physical\u2013chemical interactions between molecules, such as NQs, and the inorganic surfaces of silica oxides may contribute to tuning particle surfaces or modifying NQ structures. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the interaction of NQ molecules with the surface of SBA-15 particles These interactions were analyzed via experimental and computational studies using DFT and topology analyses with the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)."

For adsorption isotherms studies, SBA-15 particles were immersed in NQs solutions at different concentrations (5\u2013150 mg L\u22121) and stirred for 24 h, which is sufficient time for the mixture to reach equilibrium (data not shown). After reaching equilibrium, samples were filtered and measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometry; the filtrate was immediately analyzed using a Jenway 7305 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (200\u2013700 nm) at room temperature to determine NQ\u2019s free concentrations. The equilibrium adsorption of NQs (qe = mg NQs per gram of silica) was calculated by Equation (1):\nqe = (C0 \u2212 Ce)V\nm (1)\nwhere C0 and Ce (mg L\u22121) are the initial and equilibrium concentration, respectively, of any of the three NQs in solution. V (L) is the volume of NQs solution, and m (g) is the mass of the adsorbent SBA-15 particles used in the experiment. The fit of the obtained experimental data to different adsorption isotherm models can be performed using their linear forms after a mathematical transformation of the values as appropriate [44]. However, other authors suggest that such treatments increase the error of the parameters obtained in each model [45\u201347]. In this work, the adsorption isotherm data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm equations in their non-linear forms. Since the methodology for fitting the data by non-linear regression employs the minimization of an error function from the starting parameters, we used the parameters obtained from the fit to the linear form of each model as the starting parameters in each case."

The use of IR for following interactions between NQ and SBA-15\u2014like structures have been reported, and the designation of bands in this work was supported by the information previously reported by our group [64,65] and by other research groups [57,66]. Additionally, in Table 1, the hydrodynamic diameter (d.h.) is reported for SBA-15, NQ@SBA-15, 2NQ@SBA-15, and 5NQ@SBA-15. The SBA-15 d.h. value is 618 nm. All three NQs modify the d.h.; however, NQ and 5NQ have increments with values up to 400% and 600%, respectively, suggesting particle aggregation, while the d.h. value for 2NQ is 667 nm (no particle aggregation). These findings correlate with the pZ values (Table 1) where the values are 22.97, 25.17, and 28.4 mV for 5NQ, NQ, and 2NQ, respectively. Values of absolute 30 mV or higher are related to stable and non-aggregated colloids [67,68]; in these systems, 2NQ@SBA-15 is the closest value to the reference. Thus, 2NQ may interact with SBA-15\u2019s surface more effectively, but NQ and 5NQ may promote either particle\u20135NQ\u2013 particle interactions or aggregations between NQ molecules and later depositions onto SBA-15 particles. The textural properties of SBA-15 and NQs@SBA-15 were analyzed by N2 thermal adsorptions. The obtained data are shown in Figure 4. According to the BET model, SBA-15 was characterized by the adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm (type IV) that is typical for mesoporous materials with a type H1 hysteresis loop [69,70] and a surface area of 597.25 m2 g\u22121. In addition, the pore diameter\u2019s distribution curve presented mesopores with an average diameter of 9.7 nm (see insertion in Figure 4A).

On these active sites, the adsorption process occurs following some features: (1) Each active site is identical in terms of the probability of adsorbing or not adsorbing a molecule; (2) each site can adsorb only one adsorbate molecule; (3) all sites are sterically and energetically independent in their adsorption capacity; i.e., it is not conditioned by the occupation of nearby active sites. The Langmuir isotherm model is described by Equation (2): \ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc44 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc361 + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc36 (2) where \ud835\udc36 is the concentration of NQ at an equilibrium (mg L\u22121), \ud835\udc44 is the monolayer adsorption capacity (mg g\u22121), and b is the Langmuir isotherm constant related to the energy of adsorption (L mg\u22121). The parameter values of this model can be determined using a linear equation, which is expressed in Equation (3). \ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc44 \u2212 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc44 \ud835\udc36 (3) 3.3.2.

The surface area for SBA-15 was 597.25 m2/g, while the values diminished to 434.88, 441.7, and 438.99 m2/g for NQ@SBA-15, 2NQ@SBA-15, and 5NQ@SBA-15 samples, respectively. The decrease in surface area values was attributed to the partial blocking of SBA-15\u2019 surface by the adsorbed molecules.\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1464 8 of 18\nAs can be seen, the interaction between NQ, 2NQ, and 5NQ and SBA-15 modifies the surface of the particles. Given the chemical structure of the NQs, these interactions could be mediated by the H-bonds between the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of the NQ molecules and silanol groups of SBA-15\u2019s surface. Both 2NQ@SBA-15 and 5NQ@SBA-15 surface area values were slightly higher due to the presence of the hydroxyl group in the 2NQ and 5NQ molecules; then, intermolecular interactions were promoted. Considering the above, we would expect that, as a result, 2NQ and 5NQ were deposited onto the SBA-15, while NQ preserves dispersion. Indeed, the pore size for the NQs@SBA-15 samples increased as the surface area decreased, accompanied by broadening pore diameter\u00b4s distribution curves."

Temkin Isotherm Model On the other hand, Temkin et al. [77] proposed a model that explicitly considers the interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent. This model assumes that the heat of the adsorption process depends on the temperature of all molecules in an adsorption layer; the adsorption should decrease linearly rather than logarithmically. The mathematical expression that represents this model is given by Equation (6): \ud835\udc5e = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc36 (6) where \ud835\udc45 is the gas constant (8.314 J K\u22121 mol\u22121), T is the temperature (K), \ud835\udc4f is the Temkin isotherm constant, and \ud835\udc34 is the equilibrium binding constant (L g\u22121).

The case of 5NQ will be discussed below. Based on Equations (2)\u2013(6), isotherm parameters for all three systems are reported in Table 2.

These results are in agreement with those reported by other authors for the adsorption of prednisolone by SBA-15 [79] and meloxicam [80] and another system\u2019s adsorption as famotidine by Zinc chloride particles [81].\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1464 10 of 18\nAs reported before, we would expect that 2NQ and 5NQ were deposited onto the SBA-15, while NQ preserves dispersion; however, the results indicate that according to the expected outcome, the best adsorption occurs between 2NQ and SBA-15 but not with 5NQ, as its adsorption capacity is even lower than NQ\u2019s capacity. Therefore, we decided to evaluate these systems using computational chemistry techniques to understand the involved molecular mechanisms."

Molecular Model Optimization Calculation\nWe constructed molecular models for NQ, 2NQ, and 5NQ based on the literature; several authors reported that NQs possess the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds between their carbonyl and hydroxyl groups [82,83]. To consider this possibility, we constructed two models for the hydroxy-substituted NQs: closed structures (C) and open structures (O). In the closed-structure models, the hydroxyl group is oriented towards the carbonyl group, representing intramolecular hydrogen bridge-type interactions (structures 2a, 3a in Figure 6); in contrast, the open-structure models represent NQs without intramolecular hydrogen bond formations (structures 2b and 3b in Figure 6).

Calculation of the Interaction Energy (\u2206E)\nThe molecular interaction models were constructed from the optimized NQs and SiO2. Since NQs are planar molecules, we built interaction models by superimposing the NQ molecule in horizontal (H) and vertical (V) positions for the SiO2 surface. The open and closed structures of 2NQ and 5NQ were superimposed only in a horizontal position to the SiO2 surface. To calculate the interaction energy between the molecular models of NQs and the surface\u2019s molecular model, we used Equation (7):\n\u2206E = Einteraction \u2212 ( Esur f ace + ENQ )\n(7)\nwhere Einteraction is the interaction energy of the NQ@SiO2 system (Kcal mol\u22121), Esur f ace is the SiO2 energy (Kcal mol\u22121), and ENQ is the NQs energy (Kcal mol\u22121). This interaction of energy parameter represents the total energy of the physical or chemical interactions involved in the binding or formation of the adsorption product. Table 3 presents \u2206E, where we can observe that the interaction between SiO2 and NQ is stronger in the vertical position (Figure 8B) than in the horizontal position (Figure 8A). For 2NQ, there are no significant differences in the interaction for the closed system (Figure 8C) and the open system (Figure 8D). In contrast, a significant difference was observed for 5NQ, where the open system\u2019s (Figure 8F) interaction is stronger than the closed system (Figure 8E). The values corresponding to the three strongest interactions are as follows: (1) \u221296.08 kcal mol\u22121 and it corresponded to the interaction between vertical NQ (V) and SiO2. As observed in Figure 8B, this interaction is mediated by an H-bond-type interaction and two covalent interactions. One of these covalent interactions occurred between the silicon atom on the surface and the C4 of NQ, which probably promotes a change in C4\u2019s hybridization from sp2 to sp3, as evidenced by a change in the dihedral angle (C8a-C4a-C4-O12; see Figure 6) from 180\u25e6 in the sp2 configuration to 34\u25e6 in the model interaction. (2) At \u221288.92 kcal mol\u22121 between the open horizontal 5NQ (O.H.) and SiO2 (Figure 8F), in this interaction, we can see two H-bond-type interactions and one covalent interaction between the C3 of 5NQ and a silicon atom on the surface. Additionally, we can observe that the C1 carbonyl group\u2019s substrate obtains a proton from the surface, forming a hydroxyl group at C1. This could explain the modification of the crystalline pattern shown on XRD (see Figure 2D). Finally, (3) at \u221218.99 kcal mol\u22121 between the closed horizontal 2NQ (C.H.) and SiO2 (Figure 8C), we can see three H-bonds and one covalent interaction between the C1 carbonyl group of 2NQ and a silicon atom on the surface.\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1464 12 of 18\nL = Bond length; BCP = bond critical point; \u03c1rBCP = density of all electrons; BE = binding energy; CH = closed horizontal; OH = open horizontal.\nAs can be seen, in all three systems with the strongest interaction energies, at least one covalent interaction is involved. To evaluate the nature of these bonds, we calculate the Mayer (MBO) [84] and fuzzy (FBO) [85] bond orders. The power of these parameters to investigate bonding in organometallic compounds has been widely demonstrated [86]. The value of MBO agrees with the empirical bond order; for single, double, and triple bonds, the values are close to 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, respectively. On the other hand, the magnitude of FBO is comparable to MBO, especially for low-polar bonds, but it is more stable concerning the change in the basis set; therefore, we are more confident in the FBO values, as observed in Table 4. In the table, the bond order values obtained, especially the FBO values, are very close to one, evidencing the presence of a single covalent bond.\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1464 13 of 18 Pharmaceuticals 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 20\nFigure 8.

This model shows that the BE is stronger at small values of LH and decreases to a critical length of 2.72 \u00c5.

In agreement with Buemi and Zucrello, the H-bond could be weak LH > 2.2 \u00c5, moderate 1.5 \u00c5 < LH < 2.2 \u00c5, and strong 1.2 \u00c5 < LH < 1.5 \u00c5 [88].\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 20\ndensity at the bond critical point (BCP) corresponding to the H-bond obtained from the topological analysis: \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc38 \u2212223.08 \ud835\udf0c + 0.7423 (8) where the unit of \u03c1 is a.u., and the unit of BE is kcal mol\u22121.
