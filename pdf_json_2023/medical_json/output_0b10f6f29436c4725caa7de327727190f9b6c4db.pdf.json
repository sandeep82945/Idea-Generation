    "abstractText": "The causes of cardiac inflammation during the COVID-19 pandemic are manifold and complex, and may have changed with different virus variants and vaccinations. The underlying viral etiology is self-evident, but its role in the pathogenic process is diverse. The view of many pathologists that myocyte necrosis and cellular infiltrates are indispensable for myocarditis does not suffice and contradicts the clinical criteria of myocarditis, i.e., a combination of serological evidence of necrosis based on troponins or MRI features of necrosis, edema, and inflammation based on prolonged T1 and T2 times and late gadolinium enhancement. The definition of myocarditis is still debated by pathologists and clinicians. We have learned that myocarditis and pericarditis can be induced by the virus via different pathways of action such as direct viral damage to the myocardium through the ACE2 receptor. Indirect damage occurs via immunological effector organs such as the innate immune system by macrophages and cytokines, and then later the acquired immune system via T cells, overactive proinflammatory cytokines, and cardiac autoantibodies. Cardiovascular diseases lead to more severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 disease. Thus, heart failure patients have a double risk for complicated courses and lethal outcome. So do patients with diabetes, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. Independent of the definition, myocarditis patients benefitted from intensive hospital care, ventilation, if needed, and cortisone treatment. Postvaccination myocarditis and pericarditis affect primarily young male patients after the second RNA vaccine. Both are rare events but severe enough to deserve our full attention, because treatment according to current guidelines is available and necessary.",

Thisparticular form of cardiac inflammation describes a special clinical phenotype of myocarditis, the underlying cause of which has remained a matter of uncertainty and of discussion [1]. It is part of the clinical spectrum of acute myocarditis, but was neither specificallymentioned in the histologically based Dallas criteria [2], nor the report of the World Heart Federation (WHF)/ISFC (Inter-\nnational Society and Federation of Cardiology) classification of cardiomyopathies [3]. According to theWHF Consensus Classification on myocarditis [4], it falls within the histopathological entity of acute myocarditis. However, its etiology ismultifold and its pathogenesis remains unclear in all cases that do not undergo myocardial tissue analysis. It is in fact a clinical syndrome in \u201csearch of its etiological diagnosis but with therapeutical options\u201d [5].\nAfter the world became aware of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\nHerz 3 \u00b7 2023 195\nMain topic\n2 months later, which probably originated from a food market in Wuhan, we invited the organizers of this symposium, professors Dao Wang and Chen Chen, to report their first observations [6]. Consequently, we also asked the coeditors of HERZ/Cardiovascular Diseases and expert scientists in Germany to summarize in viewpoint contributions their initial experience and their assessment of the evolving pandemic [7]. Of particular interest were at that time public health issues [8\u201310], early comments on the pathogenetic aspects of pulmonary and cardiac involvement [11\u201313], and the management of patients during emergencies and in intensive care units [14\u201316].\nMeanwhile, national and international medical societies have developed guidelines on COVID-19, which also include cardiological aspects. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has developed what was named \u201cnot a guideline but a guidance\u201d [17, 18], which was designed as an orientation aid for physicians in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 62 European cardiologists as authors and 29 further experts as reviewers have contributed to this document. The German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians (DEGAM) issued a guideline directed to the general practitioner [19].\nSimilar guidelines or guidance documents have been commented on both in the United States [20] and Europe [21].\nThree years later, it is appropriate to take stock of our experience. We realize that some questions posed 3 years ago have been cleared, but others remain unresolved.\nThis review focusses on different forms of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infectionand vaccination as well as on the impact on management and outcome."

This trend was interpreted as the transition from the global pandemic to an endemic situation.\nThe declining severity of the Omicron variant is reflected by the decrease in the number of occupied beds in intensive care units in Germany despite the obvious increase in infectivity of the Omicron variant, when compared to previous variants (. Fig. 2b).\nThe coronavirus pandemic struck all countries in the world, even those that followed a strict non-COVID policy like China. Worldwide 759,407,939 individuals were reported to have suffered from SARSCoV-2, 6,866,421 patients died. Many countries are now on the way back to normality. Consequently, the rule to wear face masks in public was abandoned after 3 years of the pandemic, even in China, except for hospitals and medical practices.\nMyocarditis vs. cardiac inflammation or myocardial injury\nIn the first 2 years of the pandemic, information on cardiac involvement was primarily based on case reports.\nKawakamietal. [24] reviewed201cases from different pathological institutions and summarized: From 192 autopsy and nine biopsy cases, only nine (4.5%) had activemyocarditis (infiltrate plusmyocyte necrosis according to the Dallas criteria; [3, 4, 25]). Their report deliberately excluded necropsy cases with borderline myocarditis, which was defined as sparse infiltrate, no necrosis. They counted these cases as non-myocarditis. In his own series with 16 patients from Bergamo (Italy), which was the Italian region hit hardest during the early phase of the pandemic, they could not identify any patient with active myocarditis. His final assessment attributed death in 13 pa-\n196 Herz 3 \u00b7 2023\nM ai n to pi c\ntients only to diffuse alveolar damage (pulmonary failure), and in three cases to acute myocardial infarction. The association with a pulmonary thrombus was frequent (50%). When looking closer into their data, however, the inclusion of borderline myocarditis (infiltrate without overt necrosis) would have changed their insight into cardiac inflammation dramatically. Epicardial infiltration was present in 10 patients, lymphocytes and monocytes in the myocardial tissue samples were seen in five of the 16 patients, and, most remarkably, pericardial effusions (>50ml) were noted in 15 patients (94%). Thus, myocarditis (= lymphocyte and/or macrophage infiltrations with necrosis) and cardiac inflammation without necro-\nsis (cellular infiltrate without myocyte necrosis, but with epicarditis and pericardial effusion) classified as no myocarditis remain a hardly understandable definition and, as such, a matter of debate. By applying the WHF criteria of myocarditis, which emphasize the quantitative aspect of the cellular infiltrate as more than 14 lymphocytes+ macrophages/mm2 [4, 5], their review should have included the borderline type within the spectrum of myocarditis (. Table 1; [26]). These quantitative WHF criteria have been part of the ESC position statement of myocarditis [27] and a recent review on inflammatory cardiomyopathy (. Fig. 3; [28]).\nTo examine some of Kawakami and colleagues\u2019 201 cases in more detail is informative (. Table 2).\nSala et al. [29] identified active myocarditis in a patient with the phenotype of a reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy during the pandemic with heart failure, but could not detect viral DNA or RNA. This depicts a diagnostic dilemma even in a pandemic, in which the assumption of coronaviral etiology determined the line of thinking. Tavazzi et al. [30] reported on a patient with only a sparse infiltrate and demonstrated by electronmicroscopy that the virus was primarily in interstitial and endothelial cells aswell as inmacrophages (. Fig. 4). The budding of the virus from an interstitial cell is impressive.\nEscher et al. [30] nicely showed the action of natural killer (NK) cells by positive perforin staining in the vicinity of a small vessel. Basso et al. [32] impressed us with numerous tissue sections showing dense infiltrates and necrosis characteristic of activemyocarditis in three patients and sampleswithscarsafter infection(. Fig. 5). But the other 18 samples had only infiltrates and no obvious necrosis, and thus did not qualify for myocarditis. Instead, they would have qualified for chronic or borderlinemyocarditis according to the Dallas criteria or theWHF definition. Remarkably, infiltrates were also identified in the epicardial layer (. Fig. 6) and thepericardium. When analyzing 100 German patients immediately after recovery from coronavirus infection, sparse infiltrates, some with little necrosis, were reported. Their cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had demonstrated myocarditis and pericarditis in most cases [35].\nNecropsy data froma large study of 277 COVID-19 patients by Halushka et al. gave similar results: Myocarditis andpericarditis were ascertained in 7.2% and in 6.9%, respectively, of their pathoanatomical data set [36].\nThe data above together show the divergence in the pathologists\u2019 interpretations of active myocarditis, on the one hand, and the use of wording such as \u201cmyocardial injury\u201d or \u201cinflammatory changes\u201d to avoid the term \u201cmyocarditis,\u201d on the other hand, by clinicians. This divergence becomes even more obvious when clinical definitions of myocarditis are used with\nHerz 3 \u00b7 2023 197"

Their diagnosis of myocarditis was based on endomyocardial biopsies or increased troponin levels plus typical signs of acute myocarditis (AM) on cardiac MRI.\nWith this composite view they identified 97 patients with possible AM, and among them, 54 patients with definite/probable AM supported by endomyocardial biopsy in 17 (31.5%) ormagnetic resonance imaging in 50 patients (92.6%).\nWhen summarizing 48 case reports of 56patientswithpericarditis, thediagnosis was made mostly on the basis of clinical criteria: It showed a preponderance of men in 59% of cases with a mean age of 53\u00b1 18 years.

SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes was inhibited in this in vitro setting by the antiviral drug remdesivir.\nIn patients the pathogenetic process starts with surface adherence of the single-stranded RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract. During viremia, the virus can also enter other organs and cells expressing an ACE2 receptor [39], whereby coactivation by transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS) enables the uncoating of the virus and its incorporation into the target cell [40]. The following steps of viral replication can be appreciated best in . Fig. 7, which also depicts the junctions to interventions by medical therapy.\nThe pivotal role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced myocardial inflammation has been underlined recently [41, 42]. ACE2 plays a well-known role as an antifibrotic, antihypertrophic,\nand vasodilatory mediator of the cardiovascular hormone system. It also acts as an entry receptor for SAR-CoV-2 and serves as a link between the virus and the immune response with inflammation attributed to proinflammatory cytokines. SARS-CoV-2 can upregulate a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17, which in turn is involved in myocardial injury.\nIn addition to direct damage to the myocardium, SARS-CoV-2 exerts indirect effects on the immune system. Antigenpresenting cells (APCs) process and deliver viral antigens to naive T cells, which then become activated, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. They amplify the inflammatory response, knownas a cytokine storm, which is the resultof theoverproductionofproinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Within the innate immune system, toll-like receptors (TLRs) may be activated and permit further entry of the virus into ACE-receptor positive cells (. Fig. 8; [11])."

This is important but only indirect evidence of cardiac involvement of SARS-CoV-2-induced cardiac inflammation.\nCardiac MRI\nFrom various studies, those including a comparative analysis with biomarkers for necrosis (hs-troponin) and for heart failure (NT-proBNP) in the serum and with endomyocardial biopsies are particularly informative. In their landmark study of 100 patients after recovery from COVID-19 with a previous positive swab test, Puntmann et al. [35] found persistent elevated hs-troponin (>3pg/mL) in 71 patients. The following diagnostic criteria for myocarditis were used: late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) codes for scar or inflammation, prolonged native T1 time codes for edema, prolonged native T2 time codes for necrosis. If both native T1 and native T2 times were prolonged, inflammation was assumed. . Figure 9 thus demonstrates their results: 1. Elevated hs-troponin (>3pg/mL),\na serummarker of necrosis, was found in 71 patients.\n2. In cardiac MRI, prolonged T1 time coded for edema in 71 patients, and 3. Prolonged T2 time coded for necrosis in 60 patients. 4. Both, T1 and T2 were prolonged together in 60 patients, which coded for inflammation. 5. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) coding for scar or inflammation was found in 32 patients. 6. In the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) a sparse infiltrate by CD45R0-positive cells was described, which coded for\nborderline or chronic myocarditis in COVID-19 patients. Of note, no virus was found in myocytes.\nSimilar observations were made by Tanacli R et al. in a smaller series [43]."

Each specialty favors itsowncriteria. There is a gap in incidence between the different diagnostic approaches. 4 Cardiovascular diseases lead to more severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 disease.
