 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further optimize the structure of compound G2 to improve its potency and drug-like properties. For example, modify the linker region or add new substituents to the aromatic rings. 

2. Evaluate the anticancer effects of G2 on other cancer cell lines besides HepG2, such as lung, breast, colon, etc. This could demonstrate its broad-spectrum anticancer potential.

3. Investigate the specific molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways by which G2 induces apoptosis and inhibits AKT phosphorylation in cancer cells. This could reveal its precise modes of action.

4. Perform more comprehensive in vivo studies on G2 using additional animal models besides nude mice xenografts. Examine its pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and efficacy over long-term treatment. 

5. Explore the potential synergistic effects of G2 in combination with other chemotherapy drugs or targeted therapies. The combination strategy may enhance anticancer efficacy and reduce drug resistance.
