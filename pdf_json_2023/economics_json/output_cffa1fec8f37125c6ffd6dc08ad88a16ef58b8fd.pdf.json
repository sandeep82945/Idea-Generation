    "abstractText": "Objective: With consumers\u2019 concerns about food safety and the environment growing, the interest in organic food has increased. However, due to the late start of the organic food market in China, the market size of the Chinese organic food industry is still relatively small. This study aims to examine whether organic food credence attributes have an impact on consumers\u2019 attitudes and willingness to pay a premium (WTPP), in order to provide valuable information to facilitate the development of the organic food market in China.",

However, due to the late start of the organic food market in China, the market size of the Chinese organic food industry is still relatively small. This study aims to examine whether organic food credence attributes have an impact on consumers\u2019 attitudes and willingness to pay a premium (WTPP), in order to provide valuable information to facilitate the development of the organic food market in China.\nMethods: A questionnaire survey was conducted with 647 respondents in China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to verify the model and test the relationships among the constructs.\nResults: SEM analyses showed that credence attributes stimulate consumers\u2019 attitudes and increase consumers\u2019 WTPP. Utilitarian attitudes and hedonistic attitudes play a partially mediating role in the relationship between credence attributes and WTPP. Uncertainty negatively moderates the role between utilitarian attitudes and WTPP, while it positively moderates the role between hedonistic attitudes and WTPP.\nDiscussion: The findings reveal the motivations and barriers for Chinese consumers to purchase organic food at a premium, providing a theoretical basis for companies to gain a deeper understanding of consumer groups and develop organic food marketing strategies.\nKEYWORDS\norganic food, credence attribute, food safety, eco-friendliness, willingness to pay a premium, attitude, uncertainty\n1. Introduction\nWith rising consumer preference for food that is perceived as healthy, high quality, safe, and eco-friendly, organic food is being pursued by an increasing number of Chinese consumers. Data show that organic food sales in China reached approximately RMB 951 billion in 2021, an increase of 18.3% compared to 2020 (China, 2022). Organic consumption has become a new trend in China.

In other words, although consumers have positive intentions to purchase organic food, their actual purchase frequency and payment amount do not match their intentions, and the key reason for this mismatch is that consumers consider the price of organic food too high. The price premium for organic food has become a major obstacle in the purchasing decision process for consumers (Kim et\u00a0al., 2021; Liu and Sam, 2022). Therefore, increasing consumers\u2019 willingness to pay a premium (WTPP) is important to promote the development of China\u2019s organic food market.\nThe motivations for organic food consumption have been extensively explored in previous literature. Studies have found that consumers\u2019 motivations for purchasing organic food include economic reasons (e.g., price), social/cultural reasons (e.g., social status), personal reasons (e.g., egoistic and altruistic values), and product reasons (e.g., attributes such as health and safety; Dorce et\u00a0al., 2021; Galati et\u00a0al., 2022; Knaggs et\u00a0al., 2022; Wei et\u00a0al., 2022). In particular, concern for health, environmental protection, food safety, and taste have been identified as the main purchase motivations for organic food (Hemmerling et\u00a0al., 2015). As organic food is a credence product and its product information is harder to obtain, credence attributes play an important role in influencing consumers\u2019 organic food purchasing behavior (Giampietri et\u00a0al., 2018). The existing studies on the credence attributes of organic food mainly focus on two aspects. One is to investigate the influence of credence attributes on consumers\u2019 perception of quality and value (Lee and Hwang, 2016; Konuk, 2019). Scholars believe that the overall quality and value perception is based on consumers\u2019 evaluation of credence attributes of organic food, and consumers with a positive evaluation of the credence attributes have a higher perception of the quality and value of organic food. The other is based on consumers\u2019 psychological decision-making process. The influence of credence attributes on consumers\u2019 purchase attitudes and intentions was analyzed, and it was found that credence attributes such as health, safety, and environment-related factors of organic food all lead to positive attitudes and purchase intentions (Szolnoki and Hauck, 2020; Galati et\u00a0al., 2022). These studies on credence attributes have provided insights into consumers\u2019 motivations for purchasing organic food. However, the existing studies have focused more on the relationship between credence attributes and willingness to buy (WTB) than on willingness to pay a premium (WTPP; Lee and Hwang, 2016; Lee et\u00a0al., 2019). Given that organic food is a credence good and that there is a degree of premium, the relationship between credence attributes and WTPP needs to be\u00a0explored in more depth.\nIn terms of barriers to organic food consumption, several studies have attempted to explain the constraints in consumers\u2019 decisions related to organic food purchases through moderating variables, such as scepticism about organic certification (Moruzzo et\u00a0 al., 2020), limited availability (Rabad\u00e1n et\u00a0al., 2020), and price (R\u00f6diger and Hamm, 2015). Due to the late start of the organic food market in China, there is still a significant information asymmetry between organic food sellers and consumers (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2019), which creates uncertainty about the benefits of organic food and to some extent weakens consumers\u2019 intention to buy organic food (Talwar et\u00a0 al., 2020). Therefore, addressing consumers\u2019 uncertainty regarding organic food may be\u00a0of great significance in promoting organic food consumption. Nonetheless, there have been scarce studies emphasizing the association of uncertainty with organic food consumption.\nChina is the fourth largest organic food market after the United\u00a0 States, Germany, and France (China, 2022). The Chinese\norganic food market represents a great opportunity not only for Chinese producers but also for national exporters of organic food (Pedersen et\u00a0al., 2022). Given the situational background of the organic food market in China, it is necessary to investigate and fully understand the reaction of Chinese consumers related to organic food. Therefore, this study explores the content of food safety and eco-friendliness, two key credence attributes that promote organic food consumption (Hemmerling et\u00a0 al., 2015), based on a survey from China. The theoretical model of the stimulus-organic-response (S-O-R) model is then used to examine the relationship between the credence attributes, attitudes along the dimensions of utilitarianism and hedonism, and WTPP. Uncertainty is added as a moderating variable to delve into the barriers in the formation of consumers\u2019 purchase decisions. This study is of particular importance because it provides both new, practicerelevant empirical evidence in the field of organic food consumption and useful information for organic food producers, retailers, and exporters to gain a deeper understanding of consumer motivations. In addition, this study could greatly assist relevant regulators and policymakers in their efforts to improve and expand the organic food market."

            "text": "The stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model has its origins in environmental psychology, which assumes that external stimuli trigger internal cognitive and psycho-affective changes in individuals, resulting in certain behavioral outcomes (Darby and Karni, 1973). Stimuli are specific cues that affect an individual\u2019s internal state, i.e., various information that is internal or external, controllable or uncontrollable, in response to the quality of the product. The organism is the emotional and cognitive state of an individual when exposed to external stimuli, including attitudes, emotions, perceptions, and beliefs that typically mediate the relationship between stimuli and responses. Reactions are the final behavioral outcomes of individuals, including intentions, preferences, and behaviors, which may be\u00a0positive or negative (Ahmed et\u00a0al., 2021).\nThe S-O-R model has been successfully used in the field of organic food consumption. For example, Wang et\u00a0 al. (2021) adopted SOR theory and found that organic appeal advertising positively influences intrinsic motivation, increasing consumers\u2019 purchase intention toward organic milk. According to the S-O-R model, Sultan et\u00a0al. (2021) found that marketing communication channels for organic food and perceived organic food value (S) had a positive effect on utilitarian and hedonistic attitudes (O) and further influenced consumers\u2019 behavioral intentions (R). Liu and Zheng (2019) used health concerns, environmental concerns, and food safety as external stimuli, organic cognition as the organism, and purchase intentions as the response, confirming the significant role between consumers\u2019 food safety, health, environmental concerns, and their purchase intentions. Although the S-O-R model has shown to be\u00a0useful in predicting intentions and behaviors related to organic foods (Hempel and Hamm, 2016; Kim et\u00a0al., 2021; Liang and Lim, 2021), most studies have included purchase intentions as a response in the S-O-R model, with less attention given to consumers\u2019 WTPP for organic food. This study uses consumers\u2019 WTPP as a response, which helps to complement the theoretical research on S-O-R models in the organic food field. Furthermore, although some past studies have emphasized the importance of\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\ncredence attributes for predicting consumers\u2019 behavioral intentions toward organic food (Lee and Hwang, 2016; Kushwah et\u00a0al., 2019), there is a lack of studies that combine credence attributes with S-O-R. Lee and Yun (2015) suggested that future research should extend the S-O-R model and measure how other causal and moderating factors affect behavioral intentions. We\u00a0further extended the S-O-R model by adding uncertainty as a new moderating variable, according to the study by Lee and Yun (2015).\nIn conclusion, given the importance of S-O-R in explaining the relationship between external factors and consumer responses in previous studies, this study applies S-O-R theory to explain the effect of credence attributes on willingness to pay a premium for organic food by defining stimuli as food safety and eco-friendliness, organisms as utilitarian and hedonistic attitudes, responses as consumers\u2019 willingness to pay a premium, and introducing uncertainty as a moderating variable. On the one hand, the change in consumers\u2019 attitudes and their willingness to pay a premium in their natural state, stimulated externally by the credence attributes of organic food, fits well with S-O-R theory. On the other hand, introducing uncertainty as a moderating variable to extend S-O-R theory is supported by both previous theory and practice, and there is a practical need to conduct a more in-depth exploration of the underlying mechanism of consumers\u2019 willingness to pay a premium."

Drawing on Lee and Yun (2015), this paper classifies attitudes into two dimensions based on the function of use and purchase motivation: utilitarian attitudes and hedonistic attitudes. Utilitarian attitudes relate to the functional value of organic food, reflecting the consumer assessment of the benefits when purchasing organic food (Ditlevsen et\u00a0al., 2019), while hedonistic attitudes relate to emotional satisfaction or sensory experience, reflecting the perceived value derived from the multisensory and emotional aspects of purchasing organic food, such as the taste, freshness, or pleasure derived from doing something good for one\u2019s health and the environment (Wang et\u00a0al., 2019).\nExpectancy-value-attitude theory suggests that an individual\u2019s attitude toward an object is determined by the subjective probability that the object has a particular attribute (Ajzen and Fishbein, 2000). Specifically, an individual will form an overall attitude toward an object by assessing the attributes associated with it and the extent to which its needs are met. Organic food is a credence product that is closely related to consumers\u2019 health and safety and for which product information is difficult to obtain, and there is a certain degree of premium (Yu et\u00a0al., 2022), so consumers tend to rely on credence attributes for psychological judgment (Janssen and Hamm, 2012; Massey et\u00a0al., 2018). In organic food consumption, consumers usually pay attention to the food safety of organic food (Vapa-Tankosi\u0107 et\u00a0al., 2020; Joya et\u00a0al., 2021). They believe that organic food is produced without pesticides, chemical fertilizers, artificial additives, and other harmful substances and is safer than ordinary food (Tan et\u00a0al., 2021; Lang and Rodrigues, 2022), which makes them have a positive attitude toward organic food (\u00c7abuk et\u00a0 al., 2014; Pham et\u00a0 al., 2019).\nConsumers make positive psychological judgments about food safety that meet their own needs. Such judgments are mainly motivated by the functional and emotional affirmation of organic food, which facilitates the formation of utilitarian attitudes and hedonistic attitudes among consumers. Therefore, the following hypotheses were proposed:\nH1a: Food safety has a positive effect on utilitarian attitudes.\nH1b: Food safety has a positive effect on hedonistic attitudes."

Information about the sustainability benefits and environmental value of eco-friendliness can influence consumer attitudes toward organic food (Puteri et\u00a0al., 2022). Consumers will psychologically discern whether the eco-friendliness of organic food meets their needs and further consider whether the pro-environmental characteristics of organic food enhances their personal emotional experience (Gkargkavouzi et\u00a0al., 2019, Canio et\u00a0al., 2021). The production process of organic food is concerned with animal welfare and production equity, which promotes ecological balance and makes consumers perceive that buying organic food not only satisfies their own needs but also benefits the ecological environment, which leads to more positive utilitarian attitudes and hedonistic attitudes. Therefore, the following hypotheses were proposed:\nH2a: Eco-friendliness has a positive effect on utilitarian attitudes.\nH2b: Eco-friendliness has a positive effect on hedonistic attitudes."

            "text": "The WTPP is the willingness of consumers to pay a higher price for organic food compared to regular food (Konuk, 2018). Consumers\u2019 positive attitudes toward organic food can lead to a greater WTPP (Nassivera et\u00a0al., 2017). Consumers with a high WTPP are not paying a premium for the organic food itself but for the health and environmental benefits they feel when consuming organic food (Bry\u0142a, 2016; Molinillo et\u00a0al., 2020). This perceived stimulus induces changes in consumers\u2019 emotions and attitudes, which, in turn, affects their WTPP.\nAccording to the theory of planned behavior, attitude is an important antecedent variable of willingness (Yazar and Burucuo\u011flu, 2019). Attitude reflects not only the individual\u2019s emotional evaluation of a specific thing but also the individual\u2019s behavioral intention. The more positive the individual\u2019s attitude toward a particular thing, the more positive the individual\u2019s intention to develop that behavior (Clark et\u00a0al., 2019; Salvatore et\u00a0al., 2021). A positive attitude is an important prerequisite for organic food consumption (Boobalan et\u00a0al., 2021; Santos et\u00a0al., 2021). Compared to consumers with a negative\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nattitude, those with a positive utilitarian attitudes and hedonistic attitudes toward organic food believe that organic consumption is beneficial to health and the environment, and this belief not only results in psychological satisfaction but also stimulates their WTPP. Therefore, the following hypotheses were proposed:\nH3a: Consumers\u2019 utilitarian attitudes have a positive effect on their willingness to pay a premium.\nH3b: Consumers\u2019 hedonistic attitudes have a positive effect on their willingness to pay a premium."

            "text": "S-O-R theory holds that an individual\u2019s internal psychological state plays a mediating role between external stimuli and behavioral responses; that is, external characteristics stimulate consumers\u2019 behavioral responses by influencing their mental states (Su and Swanson, 2017). Consumers also go through a series of psychological reactions before forming a WTPP for organic food. Specifically, consumers will carefully evaluate the credence attributes of organic food to satisfy their utilitarian and hedonistic goals when purchasing organic food (Sultan et\u00a0al., 2021). With the external stimulus of the credence attributes of organic food, consumers will develop different attitudes (Brach et\u00a0al., 2018). On the one hand, the functional value that consumers perceive from the credence attributes of organic food contributes to the development of utilitarian attitudes (Fuljahn and Moosmayer, 2011). On the other hand, consumers may develop hedonistic attitudes because they feel good about doing something that is good for their health and the environment (Maehle et\u00a0al., 2015). In this case, credence attributes provide consumers a perceived stimulus that influences their attitudes toward organic food and further affects their WTPP. Therefore, the following hypotheses were proposed:\nH4a: Utilitarian attitudes play a mediating role in the effect of credence attributes and willingness to pay a premium.\nH4b: Hedonistic attitudes play a mediating role in the effect of credence attributes and willingness to pay a premium."

            "text": "Uncertainty can be\u00a0described as a state of incomplete information (Vieira, 2008). When consumers lack reliable information resources and professional knowledge to distinguish organic food, they will doubt the true properties of organic food and generate uncertainty (Yenipazarli, 2015). The current state of information credibility and standards of the organic food market is in a state of confusion, with a variety of certification systems and labels making it difficult for consumers to identify organic food. These potential information asymmetries and ambiguities can increase consumers\u2019 uncertainty (Nuttavuthisit and Th\u00f8gersen, 2017) and prevent them from accurately assessing the functional and emotional value of organic food. In this case, uncertainty\nwill reduce consumers\u2019 WTPP even if they have a positive attitude toward organic food (Th\u00f8gersen, 2016). Conversely, if the information about the production and control processes of organic food is sufficient, credible, and easily accessible, consumers\u2019 uncertainty about organic food will be\u00a0 reduced, which in turn will lead to a higher WTPP. Therefore, the following hypotheses were proposed:\nH5a: Uncertainty plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between utilitarian attitudes and willingness to pay a premium.\nH5b: Uncertainty plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between hedonistic attitudes and willingness to pay a premium.\nBased on the above hypotheses, the theoretical model of this paper is shown in Figure\u00a01."

Based on their suggestions, unclearly phrased questions were revised and repetitive questions were removed to create the final questionnaire. The formal survey was launched in mid-April.

However, we\u00a0 found that hedonistic attitudes had a greater impact on consumers\u2019 WTPP than utilitarian attitudes, which may be\u00a0 due to the fact that consumers react differently to the willingness to pay a premium price (WTPP) versus the willingness to buy (WTB). When the consumer has decided to purchase organic food and is then confronted with a high price, hedonistic attitudes become more prominent in the decision-making process.\nIn this study, we\u00a0found that utilitarian and hedonistic attitudes partially mediate the effect of credence attributes on consumers\u2019 WTPP. In other words, food safety and eco-friendly attributes have a significant direct effect on WTPP, while they are also mediated indirectly by utilitarian and hedonistic attitudes. Lee et\u00a0 al. (2019) found that utilitarian and hedonistic attitudes mediated the\nrelationship between factors related to credence attributes such as healthy content, local production, and organic food labels on purchase behavior. In fact, consumers make positive cognitive and emotional judgments about the credence attributes associated with organic food, such as associating organic food with safety and health and ecological conservation (Knaggs et\u00a0al., 2022), which makes them aware of the functional and emotional benefits and value of organic food, thus increasing their WTPP.\nBoth Teng and Lu (2016) and Nuttavuthisit and Th\u00f8gersen (2017) showed in their studies that high levels of uncertainty reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase organic food. This differs somewhat from our study, where we\u00a0 argue that the effect of uncertainty on consumers\u2019 behavioral intentions depends on consumers\u2019 attitudes. We\u00a0 found that uncertainty negatively moderates the effect of utilitarian attitudes on the WTPP and positively moderates the effect of hedonistic attitudes on the WTPP. This result suggests that perceived risk due to uncertainty negatively affects utilitarian consumers\u2019 WTPP, meaning that utilitarian consumers are less likely to make the decision to pay a premium price when they feel uncertain about information related to organic food, as they do not have the relevant knowledge or information to accurately predict the outcome of the transaction (Hassan et\u00a0al., 2013). For hedonistic consumers, uncertainty does not reduce their WTPP, probably because most consumers with hedonistic attitudes are less price sensitive and more willing to take risks when making hedonistic purchases (Sadiq et\u00a0al., 2021), so they may also be\u00a0willing to pay a premium for organic food in the face of uncertainty because of the emotional satisfaction that buying organic food can bring them. In addition, we\u00a0further found that uncertainty moderates the mediating role of utilitarian and hedonistic attitudes between credence attributes and WTPP, suggesting that the difference in indirect effects is significant at high and low levels of uncertainty."

Moreover, there is still a lack of studies to measure other causal and moderating factors in the framework (Lee and Yun, 2015), so a more robust exploration of the framework is necessary. This study is among the first to develop a model that explains how consumers\u2019 willingness to pay a premium for organic food is driven and constrained by integrating food safety, eco-friendliness, utilitarian attitudes, hedonistic attitudes, and uncertainty. It extends the S-O-R theory and its application context. At the same time, the results of the study provide a new theoretical basis for companies to develop organic food marketing strategies.\nSecondly, this study reveals the internal psychological mechanisms involved in the decision-making process of consumers in purchasing organic food. While a large number of studies have highlighted the role of attitudes in intention to purchase organic food and actual purchase behavior (Boobalan et\u00a0al., 2021; Santos et\u00a0al., 2021), they have mainly focused on unidimensional attitudes (Lee and Goudeau, 2014). This research investigated utilitarian and hedonic dimensions of attitudes toward purchasing organic foods. This conceptualization is a more integrative approach than the previous studies in which one-dimensional concept of attitudes is considered. Further, the findings suggest that hedonistic attitudes have a greater impact on consumers\u2019 WTPP, implying that consumers may be\u00a0more inclined to seek a superior emotional experience when purchasing organic food, which will provide new dimensions of exploration for future research in the area of consumer attitudes and behavior.\nThirdly, this study strengthens the explanatory power of the S-O-R model by adding uncertainty as a moderating variable to the model. Our study identifies the moderating role of uncertainty in the relationship between different dimensions of attitudes and WTPP, contributing to the explanation of the attitude-behavior gap in organic food research. Furthermore, our study found that uncertainty strengthens the mediating role of utilitarian and hedonistic attitudes between credence attributes and WTPP. This moderated mediating role could provide new and substantial insights into marketing theory and future research directions and could expand the boundaries of existing organic food research. Finally, the study spotlights the behavior of Chinese consumers in regard to organic food. Findings bridge the gap of deficient theoretical knowledge on the unique characteristics of Chinese consumers and their responses to organically grown food items."

            "text": "Firstly, we\u00a0suggest that manufacturers could consider carefully designing safety and environmental messages to showcase how organic food contributes to the health and well-being of consumers. Specifically, in terms of eco-friendliness, manufacturers may consider reporting the carbon footprint of their products and creating a consumer sustainability index (Nikolaou and Kazantzidis, 2016) to improve the perceived environmental value of a product among consumers. In terms of food safety, retailers could cite the latest and most authoritative scientific findings or endorsements by national agencies to support their claims on the safety of organic food, such as less additives and pesticide residues, more beneficial nutrients, etc. In addition, retailers could communicate the safety and environmental benefits of organic foods through social networks, mass media, and interactive screens in-store, and include integrated promotional mix elements in their communication campaign (Chekima et\u00a0al., 2019).\nSecondly, as established consumer attitudes are difficult to change (Aaker, 1996), we\u00a0 suggest that marketers could stimulate positive attitudes toward organic food by providing consumers with cues that organic food contains hedonic and utilitarian attributes that will satisfy their needs. Specifically, for utilitarian consumers, marketers may participate or sponsor research related to the organic food safety testing and reflect the findings in advertising, packaging, or leaflets, which will help stimulate utilitarian attitudes among consumers. For hedonistic consumers, marketers could focus on hedonic gratification derived from purchasing organic foods. For example, by emphasizing that an organic food purchase is a way to ultimately save animals and the environment, or by using experiential marketing methods, organizing food tastings, food festival competitions, etc. to stimulate hedonic feelings such as satisfaction. According to our findings, hedonistic attitudes have a stronger impact on consumers\u2019 WTPP compared to utilitarian attitudes. Therefore, marketers could leverage the hedonic benefits of the consumption of organic food by engaging in emotional appeal advertising and highlight the hedonic attributes of their products through a multi-sensory marketing approach (attractive packaging and good taste, etc.), thus enhancing consumer pleasure and enjoyment.\nFinally, we\u00a0 recommend that manufacturers may consider introducing the latest blockchain technology. Blockchain food traceability system has the characteristics of traceability and tamperproof, which can ensure the authenticity of information (Wei et\u00a0al., 2022), thus reducing the perceived information asymmetry between"
