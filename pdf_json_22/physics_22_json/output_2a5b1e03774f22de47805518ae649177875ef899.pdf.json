    "abstractText": "Particle-based modeling of materials at atomic scale plays an important role in the development of new materials and understanding of their properties. The accuracy of particle simulations is determined by interatomic potentials, which allow to calculate the potential energy of an atomic system as a function of atomic coordinates and potentially other properties. First-principles-based ab initio potentials can reach arbitrary levels of accuracy, however their aplicability is limited by their high computational cost. Machine learning (ML) has recently emerged as an effective way to offset the high computational costs of ab initio atomic potentials by replacing expensive models with highly efficient surrogates trained on electronic structure data. Among a plethora of current methods, symbolic regression (SR) is gaining traction as a powerful \u201cwhite-box\u201d approach for discovering functional forms of interatomic potentials. This contribution discusses the role of symbolic regression in Materials Science (MS) and offers a comprehensive overview of current methodological challenges and state-of-the-art results. A genetic programming-based approach for modeling atomic potentials from raw data (consisting of snapshots of atomic positions and associated potential energy) is presented and empirically validated on ab initio electronic structure data.

The rapid increase in processing power over the last decades has made computational modeling and simulation the main tool for studying new materials and determining their properties and behavior. Computational approaches can deliver accurate quantitative results without the need to set up and execute highly complex and costly physical experiments.\nPotential energy surfaces (PES), describing the relationship between an atomic system\u2019s potential energy and the geometry of its atoms, are a central concept in computational chemistry and play a pivotal role in particle simulations. An example PES for the water molecule is shown in Figure 1. The mathematical function used to calculate the potential energy of a system of atoms with given positions in space and generate the PES is called an interatomic potential function. The form it this function, it\u2019s physical fidelity as well as its complexity and efficiency are critical components in simulations used to predict material properties.\nThe ability to simulate large particle systems over long timescales depends critically on the accuracy and computational efficiency of the interatomic potential. Broadly speaking, the more accurate the methods, the lower its computational efficiency and the more limited its applicability. For example, first-principle modeling methods such as density functional theory (DFT) [33] provide highly accurate results by considering quantum-chemical effects but are not efficient enough to simulate large systems containing thousands of atoms over long timescales of nanoseconds [43].\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations treat materials as systems consisting of many microscopic particles (atoms) which interact with each other through interatomic potentials depending mainly on their positions and are governed by the laws of statistical thermodynamics. Macroscopic properties of materials are obtained as time and/or ensemble averages of processes emerging at the microscopic scale [27].\nEmpirical and semi-empirical methods treat atomic interactions in a more coarsegrained manner via parameterized analytical functional forms and trade-off accuracy for execution speed in order to enable simulations at a larger scale. Although they are computationally undemanding, they are only able to provide a qualitatively reasonable description of chemical interactions [52].\nMachine learning (ML) interatomic potentials aim to bridge the gap between quantum and empirical methods in order to deliver the best of both worlds: functional forms that are as efficient as empirical potentials and as accurate as quantum-chemical approaches."

For example, the most popular ML methods used to represent many-body PESs, ANNs, require complex architectures with many adjustable parameters (weights of neural synapses and neuron biases) to yield sufficiently flexible and invariant PESs representations. For this, large amounts of training data (often dozens or even hundreds of thousands points) are needed. On the other hand, the number of training data should be kept as low as possible since they are are calculated via demanding quantum-chemical methods. It means that as simple as possible analytic representations of PESs are needed.\nIntegration of physical knowledge and interpretability\nRelated to the mathematical complexity issue, it is also important to note that most of the ML methods (e.g., ANN, SVM) are of a \u201cblack-box\u201d nature and may be less amenable to including physical information into the functional forms, relying at least partially on physics-inspired features considered in atomic descriptors. This often leads to increased mathematical and computational complexity of resulting interaction models.

They rewrite it in the form:\n\ud835\udc40 ( \ud835\udc37 (\ud835\udc5f), \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc5f) ) = \ud835\udc37 (\ud835\udc5f) ( 1 \u2212 exp ( \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc5f) ) )2 (3) and use genetic programming to find the best \ud835\udc37 (\ud835\udc5f) and \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc5f).\nThe directed search approach is augmented with an error metric that better reflects the physical characteristics of the problem. A standard error metric such as the MSE has the disadvantage of overemphasizing high-energy points which are rarely used during simulation. For this reason, the authors found it advantageous to introduce a scaling factor:\n\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc4e) = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56 ( \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56) \u2212 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56; \ud835\udc4e) )2 \ud835\udc382 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56) + \ud835\udeff2\n(4)\nwhere the constant \ud835\udeff is added to prevent division by zero.\nDiscovering Interatomic Potentials with Symbolic Regression 7\nFor each function \ud835\udc53\ud835\udefc in the population of individuals, the fitness function is then defined as: \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udefc = exp ( \u2212 \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc39\ud835\udefc ) (5)\nwhere parameter \ud835\udefd controls how discriminating the function is and is adaptively updated during the run. The search starts with a small value for \ud835\udefd which is gradually increased as the search improves.\nThe authors note the importance of including the derivative of the energy in the training data:\n\ud835\udc39 \u2032(\ud835\udc4e) = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56 |\u2207\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56) \u2212 \u2207 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56; \ud835\udc4e) |2 |\u2207\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56) |2 + \ud835\udeff\u20322 (6)\nLeading to an expanded fitness function \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udefc:\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udefc = exp (\u2212\ud835\udefd(\ud835\udc39 + \ud835\udc39 \u2032)) (7)\nThe recombination pool is filled using a proportional selection scheme.

            "text": "Belluci and Coker [7, 8] employ symbolic regression to discover empirical valence bond (EVB) models using directed search augmented with a multilevel genetic programming approach: the lower level (LLGP) optimizes co-evolving populations of models, while the higher level (HLGP) optimizes genetic operator probabilities of the lower level populations. The approach entitled Parallel Multilevel Genetic Program (PMLGP) found accurate EVB models for proton transfer in 3-hydroxygramma-pyrone (3-HGP) in gas phase and protic solvent as well as ultrafast enolketo isomerisation in the lowest singlet excited state of 3-hydroxyflavone (3-HF).\nAt the lower level (LLGP), the authors use the same error metric and fitness as in [37], namely Equations 4 and 5. LLGP individuals represent the \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc5f) functional part of the Morse potential (see Equation 3). Remarkably, PMLGP does not use crossover but instead uses six different mutation operators:\n\u2022 Point mutation randomly replaces a subtree with a randomly-generated one. \u2022 Branch mutation replaces a binary operator with one of its arguments at random. \u2022 Leaf mutation replaces a leaf node with another randomly selected leaf. \u2022 New tree mutation replaces an entire tree with a newly generated tree. \u2022 Parameter change replaces each parameter value \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 with \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 + (\ud835\udc45 \u2212 0.5)\ud835\udefe, where\n\ud835\udc45 is a uniform random number on the unit interval and \ud835\udefe is a scaling constant. \u2022 Parameter scaling replaces each parameter value \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 with \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc45\ud835\udefe, where \ud835\udc45 is a\nuniform random number on the unit interval and \ud835\udefe is a scaling constant.\nOf the last two types of mutation, parameter change is designed to make small local moves in parameter space, while parameter scaling is designed to make large moves in parameter space as to escape the basins of attraction of local optima. Selection is performed using stochastic universal sampling [3].\nAt the higher level (HLGP) a real vector encoding is used to represent genetic operator probabilities. The population is initialized with \ud835\udc58 random vectors \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58 =( \ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc58) 1 , ..., \ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc58) 6 ) , with \u2211 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc58) \ud835\udc56\n= 1, where \ud835\udc58 ranges from 1 to the total number \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5d of processors, such that each vector corresponds to one of the LLGP populations whose operator probabilities it dynamically adapts.\nThe fitness of each vector \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58 is evaluated based on the maximum fitness delta in the corresponding LLGP population over a specified time interval \u0394\ud835\udc61:\n\ud835\udc39HLGP\ud835\udc58 = \u0394\ud835\udc39LLGPmax\n\u0394\ud835\udc61 (9)\nDiscovering Interatomic Potentials with Symbolic Regression 9\nThis is based on the idea that the larger the magnitude of \ud835\udc39HLGP \ud835\udc58 , the more successful the set of probabilities \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58 at improving the fitness of the population.\nTwo genetic operators are used to modify the probability vectors \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58 :\n\u2022 Mutation changes each component of the vector by a random amount with the constraint that all components sum up to one. This operator kicks in when the fitness of a vector \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58 drops below a given threshold. \u2022 Adaptation attempts to improve the probability distribution given by \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58 by using feedback from the LLGP. Each LLGP builds a histogram of the number of times each mutation produced the most fit member of the population. Then the success frequency of the mutation operator is given by:\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 = 1 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc5b = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\nHere, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 is a weight, \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56 is the number of successful mutations for the \ud835\udc56th operator (component of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58 ) and \ud835\udc5b is the total number of successful mutations (for all operators). Based on the success frequencies, adaptation shifts a random amount of probability from the least successful operator to the most successful operator.\nThe number of LLGP populations (and HLGP individuals, respectively) is set to the number of available processors. Initially, all LLGP populations are identical but diverge during evolution as each corresponding fitness function is parameterized with a different value of \ud835\udefd evenly sampled over a specified range. In effect, this applies different selection pressures on each LLGP population. Migrations are performed after the last adaptation step in HLGP. At this point, copies of the fittest individual in each LLGP population are sent to all the other populations, where they replace the least fit individual."

High effective temperatures favor exploration by accepting new trees even if their fitness is poor, low effective temperatures favor exploitation by being sensitive to small changes in fitness. By using replicas at different temperatures the approach simultaneously performs both exploitation and exploration.\nThe remarkable aspect about this approach is that it marks the first large-scale application of genetic programming in materials science with interesting extensions to the canonical Koza-style algorithm and without restrictions of the hypothesis space.\nThe training data used consists of 10 nuclear configurations of 10 particles placed in 3-d space.

Fitness is defined as the negative mean squared error.\nThe evolutionary search is organized as a three-stage process consisting of: generation, mutation and testing.\nOffspring individuals are tested for acceptance into the new population. A new tree is unconditionally accepted if its fitness exceeds the old one at the same index. Otherwise, it is accepted with the Boltzmann probability:\n\ud835\udc43accept = min { 1, exp ( \ud835\udc39new \u2212 \ud835\udc39old\n\ud835\udc47 )} where \ud835\udc39old and \ud835\udc39new are the old and new fitness values, and \ud835\udc47 is the effective temperature.\nAfter each generation, each sub-population exchanges one tree with its left neighbour in temperature space and one tree with its right neighbor.

The main assumption is that multiscale modeling requires only relevant information at the appropriate length or time scale.\nKMC constructs a look-up table consisting of an a priori list of events such as atomic jumps or off-lattice jumps. This yields several order of magnitude increases in simulated time and allows to directly model many processes unaproachable by MD alone. However, identifying barrier energies from a list of events is difficult and restricts the applicability of the method.\nHere, symbolic regression is proposed to identify the functional form of the potential energy surface at barrier energy points from a limited set of ab initio training data.The method entitled Symbolically-Regressed Table KMC (sr-KMC) [44] provides a machine learning replacement for the look-up table in KMC, thus removing the need of explicit calculation of all activation barriers.\nSastry [44] show that symbolic regression allows atomic-scale information (diffusion barriers on the potential energy surface) to be included in a long-time kinetic simulation without maintaining a detailed description of the all atomistic physics, as done within molecular dynamics.\n12 Burlacu et al.\nIn this approach, fitness is computed as a weighted mean absolute error between the predicted and calculated barriers, for \ud835\udc41 random configurations:\n\ud835\udc39 = 1 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 \u0394\ud835\udc38pred (x\ud835\udc56) \u2212 \u0394\ud835\udc38calc (x\ud835\udc56) (14)\nSetting \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 = |\u0394\ud835\udc38calc |\u22121 gives preference to predicting accurately lower-energy (most significant) events over higher energy events.\nThe algorithm uses the ramped-half-and-half tree creation method, tournament selection and Koza-style subtree crossover, subtree mutation and point mutation [34]."

Two types of potentials (Morse and TB-SMA) are used to generate the training data via molecular dynamics.

Their implementation is based on Hierarchical Fair Competition (HFC) by Jianjun et al. [28].\nDiscovering Interatomic Potentials with Symbolic Regression 13\nThe HFC framework [28] is designed towards maintaining a continuous supply of fresh genetic diversity in the population and protecting intermediate individuals who have not reached their evolutionary potential from being driven to extinction by unfair competition. It implements these goals with the help of a hierarchical population structure where individuals only compete with other individuals of similar fitness.\nBrown et al. note that a correlation-based fitness measure would increase the efficiency of the search and propose the following formula using the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n\ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc41 + 100 \u2212 100 \ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 \u2212 ?\u0304?)

These include several mutations (standard, shrink, swap, constant), subtree-swapping crossover, tournament selection and elitism:\n\u2022 Standard mutation replaces a node in the tree with a randomly-generated subtree. \u2022 Swap mutation swaps two nodes in the tree. \u2022 Shrink mutation replaces a subtree with one of its arguments. \u2022 Swap subtree mutation swaps a subtree\u2019s arguments. \u2022 Ephemeral mutation changes the value of a constant in the tree.\nAdditionally, pm-dreamer implements support for distributed evolution using the MPI standard and introduces migration operators that exchange individuals between sub-populations at fixed intervals.\nBloat reduction strategies are implemented to prevent the expression trees from becoming increasingly large, a tendency observed especially in the case of three-body modeling. Two strategies are tested:\n\u2022 Using a simplification operator which replaces subtrees that evaluate to a constant value with the constant value. This operator is applied generationally at a fixed interval. \u2022 Using penalty terms to the fitness function: in this case the fitness is decreased based on a threshold penalty size value \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f and a maximum penalty size \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52, such that trees with length < \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4f are not penalized at all, and trees with length > \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52 are penalized fully (fitness is set to zero).\n14 Burlacu et al.\nLocal search. Local search based on the derivative-free Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm is employed with a set probability, optimizing either a single constant or all the constants in the expression. HFC Extension. Brown et al. implement HFC in a parallel manner by allowing populations with different fitness thresholds to evolve in parallel, with periodic migrations between them. After migrations, populations that grow too large are \u201cdecimated\u201d by removal of the least fit individuals, while populations that grow too small are supplemented with new randomly-generated individuals.\nThe population fitness thresholds are adapted during the search using two strategies: the first strategy uses a percentile parameter \ud835\udc5d which determines the fitness threshold such that \ud835\udc5d percent of individuals have equal or lower fitness. The second strategy uses fixed thresholds determined by the first non-zero threshold along with a scaling parameter equal to the ratio between successive thresholds."

These sets are periodically filled up with individuals at preset intervals.\nNew individuals are generated by means of crossover and mutation. Crossover replaces a random subtree in the root parent with either another random subtree from another parent or with a linear combination of random subtrees from two different parents. The first method was applied with probability 0.9 while the second method was applied with probability 0.1.\nMutation can replace a subtree with a randomly generated one, swap the arguments of non-commutative symbols or change the symbols of function nodes.

Parallel, islandbased approaches are employed in all of the discussed methods, on the one hand, to more efficiently search the hypothesis space and on the other hand, to achieve higher throughput and alleviate the high computational costs of summations over two- and three-body atomic interactions.\nPhysical plausibility is promoted by restricting the hypothesis space (directed search), including domain specific information into the fitness function (e.g. weighing down high-energy points) or including additional targets (forces and stresses).\n1 https://gitlab.com/muellergroup/poet\n18 Burlacu et al.\nThe results achieved so far have demonstrated the ability of symbolic regression to discover highly accurate and physically-plausible functional forms which can increase, due to their simplicity and efficiency, the performance of particle simulations (allowing them to run at larger scales or for longer times). At the same time, since the models are inherently more simple than similar black-box models such as ANNs, they tend to require a lesser amount of training data, which increases their applicability.\nOverall, it can be concluded that symbolic regression represents a very promising approach for discovering more accurate and efficient potentials. However, designing evolutionary systems for this application area requires consideration of specific challenges as described in Section 1.2. In the following section we discuss several ideas towards a GP system design which is able to address the domain-specific requirements of interatomic potential."

            "text": "The problem of modeling interatomic potentials from data has the main particularity that data comes in the form of atomic configuration snapshots. Each configuration describes the positions of the atoms, its energy and optionally other properties (forces, stresses). Canonically, these data snapshots are generated by molecular dynamics simulation packages such as LAMMPS [42] or VASP [35] and come in specific formats, see e.g. POSCAR2.\nAt the minimum, raw data has the following form: r(1)1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 r (1) \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc38 (1) ... ... ... r(\ud835\udc41 )1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 r (\ud835\udc41 ) \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc41 )  where r(\ud835\udc58)\n\ud835\udc56 is the position of the \ud835\udc56th atom in the snapshot \ud835\udc58 and \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc58) is the associated\npotential energy value. Since atomic interactions are computed based on the distances between atoms, the Cartesian coordinates need to be converted into sets of pairwise distances relative to each atom. It is then the role of the genetic system to evolve an accurate functional relationship between distances \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 and potential energy. For each training sample \ud835\udc58 , the symbolic regression model needs to process a set of pairwise atomic distances into a prediction for the energy with the help of summation symbol \u2211 .\nAs it becomes apparent from studying previous approaches described in Section 2, modeling interatomic potentials is a non-trivial problem which requires substantial computational resources. Previous implementations employed different strategies for parallelism as well as other optimization techniques such as vectorized model evaluation in order to speed up the search. Additionally, most approaches employed local search in order to improve model coefficients during evolution.\n2 https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/POSCAR\nDiscovering Interatomic Potentials with Symbolic Regression 19\nFor this reason, we opt to extend the framework Operon [13] with additional functionality for modeling interatomic potentials. Operon already benefits from a fine-grained parallelism model designed for scalability and was shown to perform well on a variety of symbolic regression problems [14]. Additionally, it features support for local optimization using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm, where the gradient is obtained via automatic differentiation.\nWe adopt a multi-objective approach based on the NSGA2 algorithm [16] where model length is used alongside prediction accuracy in order to promote parsimony, interpretability and generalization."

Evaluation efficiency is achieved by employing a batched tree interpreter, which iterates over the tree nodes and executes the corresponding functions on fixedsize batches of data. As the batch size is known at compile-time, these operations are vectorized. The entire tree evaluation infrastructure relies on the Eigen C++ library [22] for efficient, vectorized execution.\n20 Burlacu et al.\n3.1.1 Implementing the \u2211 symbol\nThe tree interpreter represents a generic approach to tree evaluation and is agnostic of the actual primitive set used by the algorithm. Each node is mapped to a callable3 (stateful function object) which defines the functional transformation. The callables themselves are required to satisfy a certain function signature and to operate in both scalar and dual number domains.\nThis mechanism facilitates the extension of the default primitive set with any kind of ad hoc functionality \u2013 the \u2211 (summation) symbol in this particular application. Figure 4 shows the general workflow for processing a set of atomic positions into pairwise distances and using them to estimate the potential energy. The function \ud835\udc39 represents a symbolic functional form which includes \u2211 symbols over pairwise\natomic distances. Since the \u2211\nsymbol is essentially a reduction operator4, the actual number of dimensions of the input data is three: \ud835\udc41 snapshots, \ud835\udc40 atoms, \ud835\udc3f pairwise distances (where \ud835\udc3f dynamically depends on the cut-off radius \ud835\udc5fout).\nAtom \ud835\udc56\nSnapshot k\n\ud835\udc37 (\ud835\udc58) \ud835\udc56 = {\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 |\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 < \ud835\udc5fout}\nAggregate distances\n?\u0302?

Therefore, it is not straightforward to accommodate an additional data dimension without significant redesign work. However, it is relatively easy to incorporate an extra, inner dataset into the function object associated to the \u2211 symbol, which will contain the values in the third dimension (interatomic distances). For this mechanism to work, a convention is necessary: the outer dataset will contain the target energy values as well as an input variable \ud835\udc5f whose value is always 1 (this value was chosen arbitrarily as a non-problematic constant which does not cause discontinuities). The variable \ud835\udc5f simply acts a placeholder for the pairwise atomic distance values. The inner dataset will contain the actual pairwise distances under the same input name \ud835\udc5f.

The direction of the relationship is determined using a comparison of median values and shown as \u2191 (worse/higher error) or \u2193 (better/lower error) symbols prefixed to the values.\nThe overall best models from all runs and all configurations are shown in Table 5. These models have been selected based on both test accuracy and simplicity of their functional form. Two other models with better test score have been discarded due to very complex structure or very large coefficient values. Table 5 illustrates this fact by displaying the absolute rank of each model (based purely on test accuracy and disregarding other criteria).\nInterestingly, the arithmetic-only configurations A, B, C generated 4 out of 5 of the selected best models. Although configuration A produced significantly worse (\ud835\udc5d < 0.01) training accuracies than all other configurations, it did not produce worse models in terms of generalization, where it is only worse than E. Nevertheless, the explicit inclusion of 1/\ud835\udc5f as an input seems to help the search.\nIt is also worth noting that configurations using the analytic quotient instead of (unprotected) division generally perform better on the training data (\ud835\udc5d < 0.05), but do not perform better on the test data. For example, configuration K is better than A, B, C, H, I in terms of training accuracy, but is not better than any of them in terms of test (on the contrary, it is worse than E at \ud835\udc5d < 0.05). From this we can surmise that in this particular test setting and for this particular data, AQ does not offer an advantage compared to normal division.\nOverall, judging from median error values and statistical significance p-values, there is no clear winner among the tested configurations. However, a pattern emerges when observing the functional forms of the best models, mostly originating from configurations B and C. After simplification using Sympy, the models become highly similar with the same mathematical structure consisting of a sum of three factors in the numerator (each including the inverse of \ud835\udc5f) and another sum in the denominator\nDiscovering Interatomic Potentials with Symbolic Regression 23\n(also including the inverse of \ud835\udc5f).

In comparison, Hernandez et al. [24] report 360 CPU-hours expended on finding accurate GP models.\nDiscovering Interatomic Potentials with Symbolic Regression 25"

Both previous results, as well as results obtained by our own proposed approach and described in this paper, suggest that SR is capable of finding accurate models that can further the capabilities of particle simulations.\nSimilar to POET [24], our approach does not restrict the search space in any way (with the exception of tree length and depth limits) and is therefore capable of finding models that do not resemble previously known, empirical potential functions. At the same time, should a directed search be required, the framework is trivial to extend with this feature.\nEmpirical testing shows that relatively simple primitive sets are powerful enough to discover accurate potential functions with good extrapolation behavior. On this data, no advantage was found in using the analytical quotient over standard division. More experiments will be required to establish the benefits of larger primitive sets, for example ones that include logarithmic, exponential or trigonometric functions.\nSeveral other aspects like a more comprehensive search in the space of hyperparameters or an exploration of the effects of local search also need to be fully investigated in the future. Compared to other works described in our survey, our approach did not diverge from the \u201cvanilla\u201d version of GP, using a classical multiobjective approach (NSGA2) together with a domain specific primitive set. It will be also worthwhile to explore various ways to scale up the search using multiple populations and more sophisticated evolutionary models.\nFuture development directions include expanding the capabilities of the framework to include three- or many-body interactions, to consider model derivatives in order model atomic forces as well, and overall to improve its ability to incorporate and respect the fundamental laws of this kind of physical systems.\n26 Burlacu et al."
