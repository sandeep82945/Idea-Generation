            "text": "According to our modern understanding of the phenomenon of radio pulsars, their radio emission is associated with secondary electron-positron plasma generated in the polar regions of a neutron star (Sturrock 1971; Ruderman & Sutherland 1975; Arons 1982; Lyne & Graham-Smith 2012; Lorimer & Kramer 2012). It is therefore not surprising that the cessation condition of the generation of secondary particles is associated with the so-called \u201ddeath line\u201d on the P\u2013P\u0307 (or P\u2013B0) diagram, where P is the pulsar period, and B0 is the magnetic field at the magnetic pole.\nDetailed works devoted to the generation of secondary plasma have been underway since the beginning of the eighties (Daugherty & Harding 1982; Gurevich & Istomin 1985; Arendt & Eilek 2002; Istomin & Sobyanin 2007; Timokhin 2010; Medin & Lai 2010; Timokhin & Arons 2013; Philippov et al. 2015; Timokhin & Harding 2015; Cerutti et al. 2016). Nevertheless, up to now, a large number of different options are discussed in the literature (Ruderman & Sutherland 1975; Blandford & Scharlemann 1976; Arons 1982; Usov & Melrose 1995), leading to very different conditions which set the \u201ddeath line\u201d of radio pulsars (Chen & Ruderman 1993; Zhang et al. 2000; Hibschman & Arons 2001; FaucherGigu\u00e9re & Kaspi 2006; Konar & Deka 2019).\nIn this and the following article, we set ourselves the task of reconsidering all basic approximations usually used in constructing the secondary plasma production model, but which may work poorly near \u201dthe death line\u201d. In particular, we assume that due to irregularity of the secondary plasma\n? E-mail: beskin@lpi.ru\nproduction, almost the entire region of open field lines can be considered in a vacuum approximation: \u03c1e = 0. In other words, our task is to clarify the position of the \u201ddeath valley\u201d (Chen & Ruderman 1993) using modern models of the magnetosphere structure and the deceleration of a neutron star; the latter is necessary to quantify the period derivative P\u0307 in terms of P , B0, and the inclination angle \u03c7. The effects of general relativity will also be taken into account.\nPlease note that in this work, the \u201dclassical\u201d mechanism of the particle production is considered due to the single-photon conversion of the \u03b3-quantum into an electronpositron pair in a superstrong magnetic field. As is wellknown (Sturrock 1971; Ruderman & Sutherland 1975), this process includes primary particle acceleration by a longitudinal electric field, emission of \u03b3-quanta due to curvature radiation, production of secondary electron-positron pairs, and, finally, secondary particle acceleration in the opposite direction, which also leads to the creation of secondary particles. In other words, we do not consider particle production due to Inverse Compton Scattering, which, as is well known (Blandford & Scharlemann 1976; Zhang et al. 2000), can also be a source of hard \u03b3-quanta. As an excuse, we note that we will first of all be interested in old pulsars, in which the surface temperature may not be high enough to form a sufficient number of X-ray photons.\nFor the same reason, we do not take into consideration synchrotron photons emitted by secondary pairs. The point is that, as is well known (see, e.g. Gurevich & Istomin 1985; Istomin & Sobyanin 2007 and Sect. 3.1 below), the energy of synchrotron photons emitted by secondary particles is approximately 15 \u201320 times less than the energy of curvature photons emitted by primary particles. Therefore, near the\n\u00a9 0000 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n02 87\n5v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .H\nE ]\n8 J\nan 2\n02 2\nthreshold of particle production, when the free path length of curvature photons become close to the radius of the star R, the pulsar magnetosphere appears to be transparent for synchrotron photons.\nLet us recall that the cessation condition for the pair creation determining \u201dthe death line\u201d was first evaluated by Ruderman & Sutherland (1975) from the equality of the height of the 1D vacuum gap\nHRS \u223c (\n~ mec )2/7( B0 Bcr )\u22124/7 R 3/7 L R 2/7 c (1)\nand the polar cap radius Rcap \u2248 ( \u2126R\nc\n)1/2 R. (2)\nHere Bcr = m2ec3/e~ = 4.4 \u00d7 1013 G is the Schwinger magnetic field, RL = c/\u2126 is the radius of the light cylinder (\u2126 = 2\u03c0/P is the star angular velocity) and Rc is the curvature of the magnetic field lines near the magnetic pole. For the magneto-dipole energy losses\nWtot \u223c B20\u2126 4R6\nc3 (3)\nand the dipole magnetic field stricture, when\nRc = 4\n3\nr\n\u03b8m , (4)\n(r and \u03b8m are the polar coordinates relative to the magnetic axis, r is the distance from the star center), one can obtain for \u201dthe death line\u201d (Ruderman & Sutherland 1975)\nP\u0307\u221215 = \u03b2dP 11/4, (5)\nwhere P\u0307\u221215 = 1015P\u0307 and \u03b2d \u223c 1. It is clear that in the mid-70s such accuracy was quite acceptable, especially since expression (5) was really limited from below most of the pulsars in the P\u2013P\u0307 diagram. However, as was already shown by Chen & Ruderman (1993), the standard RS model (dipole magnetic field, etc.) gives a very large period derivative P\u0307 for the observed \u2018\u2019death line\u201d. That is why the idea was put forward to consider a more complex structure of the magnetic field resulting in a decrease of the period derivative (and leading to the appearance of a \u201ddeath valley\u201d). However, as was already emphasized, the observed period derivative P\u0307 can be affected by many other reasons (masses and radii of neutron stars, the size of the polar cap, the effects of general relativity), which were not considered in the qualitative analysis carried out by Chen & Ruderman (1993). In particular, within the framework of this model, the simplest magnetodipole formula was used to determine the period derivative P\u0307 , which, as it is now clear, does not correspond to reality. Therefore, one of the main tasks of our consideration is the question of what parameters can lead to a decrease in the observed deceleration rate P\u0307 .\nTo clarify this issue, we consider an almost vacuum gap model of the polar region. Remember that all modern models of particle generation (including recent PIC simulations) implicitly assume free ejection of particles from the neutron star surface. Consequently, one could expect that the potential drop would be close to that predicted in the Arons (1982) model, i.e. much smaller than in the vacuum gap RudermanSutherlend model. However, as was shown in recent works performed in the PIC simulation (Timokhin 2010; Philippov\net al. 2020), due to strong nonstationarity, vacuum regions appear from time to time, with the potential drop being close to the vacuum gap model. Particularly, such an assumption is natural for the pulsars located near \u201dthe death line\u201d. In this case, the beginning of the cascade (and, hence, the filling of this region with a secondary electron-positron plasma) can be initiated by the cosmic gamma background, which, as is known, leads to 105\u2013108 primary particles per second in the polar cap region (Shukre & Radhakrishnan 1982).\nOn the other hand, for the pulsars in the vicinity of the \u201ddeath line\u201d, the free path length l\u03b3 of \u03b3-quanta leading to the production of secondary particles can be of the order of star radius R (the scale of the diminishing of the dipole magnetic field), i.e. much larger than the transverse size of the polar cap Rcap \u223c 0.01R. Therefore, we need to determine 3D potential resulting in the acceleration of primary particles.\nLet us note straight away that below we consider only a dipole magnetic field despite a large number of works which indicated that it is impossible to explain \u201dthe death line\u201d in a dipole magnetic field (Arons 1993; Asseo & Khechinashvili 2002; Barsukov & Tsygan 2010; Igoshev et al. 2016; Bilous et al. 2019). In other words, one of our tasks is to verify the possibility of explaining the position of \u201dthe death line\u201d by other factors which are usually not considered when analysing the processes of secondary plasma production. Among such possible factors, one can indicate a decrease in the magnetic field with distance from the star, the possibility of producing secondary pairs by \u03b3-quanta whose energy is much larger than the typically used characteristic energy of the maximum of the spectrum, as well as the fact that secondary plasma is generated on field lines located closer to the magnetic axis than gamma-ray emitting particles. All these effects become significant near \u201dthe death line\u201d when the free pass of \u03b3-quanta becomes comparable to the radius of a neutron star. The role of the non-dipole magnetic field and all the other physical parameters which can affect the position of \u201dthe death line\u201d, will be discussed in detail in Paper II.\nAs for Paper I, which is the first in a series of papers devoted to a detailed analysis of \u201dthe death line\u201d of radio pulsars, it is devoted to the possibility of producing secondary particles at sufficiently large periods P . In Sect. 2, we construct an exact three-dimensional solution for a longitudinal electric field E\u2016 in the polar regions of a neutron star in the case when plasma is absent in the entire region of open field lines. We show that in real dipole geometry for non-zero inclination angles \u03c7, the longitudinal electric field decreases much slower than previously assumed. In addition, the corrections related to the effects of general relativity are determined. Further in Sect. 3, we show that close to \u201dthe death line\u201d a major role in particle creation begin to play those \u03b3-quanta whose energy is several times greater than the commonly used characteristic energy of curvature radiation. Finally, in Sect. 4, the generation of secondary electron-positron pairs near \u201dthe death line\u201d is considered when the second-generation particles produced by the conversion of synchrotron photons can be neglected. Sect. 5 is devoted to the conclusion and discussion.\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)"

As in the rotation reference frame, the first Maxwell equation has a form (Ruderman & Sutherland 1975)\n\u2207E = 4\u03c0(\u03c1e \u2212 \u03c1GJ), (6)\nwhere\n\u03c1GJ = \u2212 \u2126B\n2\u03c0c (7)\nis the Goldreich & Julian (1969) charge density, the electric potential \u03c8 must satisfy the relation\n\u22072\u03c8 = \u22122\u2126B c\n(8)\nwith the boundary conditions\n\u03c8(star surface) = 0, (9) \u03c8(separatrix) = 0. (10)\nAs is well-known (see, e.g. Beskin 2010 for more detail), the first boundary condition is related to the assumption of the high conductivity of a neutron star surface. The second condition on the separatrix separating the regions of open and closed field lines follows from the assumption that in the closed field line region, there is enough plasma to screen the longitudinal electric field. Note also that, despite the fact that the shape of the polar cap is not circular at nonzero inclination angles, we restrict ourselves to considering only the case of a circular polar cap.\nIn real dipole geometry, when B = (3(nm)n \u2212m)/r3, equation (8) looks like\n1 r2 \u2202 \u2202r\n( r2 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202r\n) + 1\nr2 sin \u03b8\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8\n( sin \u03b8 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03b8\n) +\n1\nr2 sin2 \u03b8\n\u22022\u03c8\n\u2202\u03d52\n= \u22122\u2126B0 c\nR3\nr3\n( cos \u03b8 cos\u03c7+ 3\n2 sin \u03b8 sin\u03d5 sin\u03c7\n) , (11)\nwhere \u03c7 is the inclination angle. Then for the circular shape of the polar cap, the boundary conditions (9)\u2013 (10) have a form\n\u03c8(r = R, \u03b8, \u03d5) = 0, (12) \u03c8(r, \u03b8 = \u03b80(r), \u03d5) = 0, (13)\nwhere for small angles \u03b8\n\u03b80(r) = ( rR20 R3 )1/2 . (14)\nHere\nR0 = f 1/2 \u2217\n( \u2126R\nc\n)1/2 R (15)\nis the polar cap radius, and we introduce standard dimensionless area f \u223c 1.\nFor zero longitudinal electric currents, the dimensionless area of a polar cap f\u2217 changes from f\u2217 = 1.59 for \u03c7 = 0\u25e6 to f\u2217 = 1.96 for \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 (Michel 1973; Beskin et al. 1983). Modern numerical simulations show that f\u2217 changes from f\u2217 = 1.46 for \u03c7 = 0\u25e6 to f\u2217 = 1.75 for \u03c7 = 90\u25e6 (Gralla et al.\n2017). The convenience of introducing a dimensionless area f is due to the fact that in a dipole field for small angles,\n\u03b8 = f1/2 ( \u2126r\nc\n)1/2 , (16)\nso that f is constant along the dipole magnetic field line. As a result, the solution of equation (11) looks like\n\u03c8 = 1\n2\n\u2126B0R 2 0\nc cos\u03c7\u00d7[\n1\u2212 \u03b8 2 \u03b820(r) \u2212 \u2211 i c (0) i ( r R )\u2212\u03bb(0)i /\u03b8\u20320 J0(\u03bb (0) i \u03b8/\u03b8 \u2032 0)\n]\n+ 3\n8\n\u2126B0R 2 0\nc sin\u03d5 sin\u03c7\u00d7 (17)[\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8 3\n\u03b820(r) \u2212 \u03b8\u20320 \u2211 i c (1) i ( r R )\u2212\u03bb(1)i /\u03b8\u20320 J1(\u03bb (1) i \u03b8/\u03b8 \u2032 0) ] .\nHere\u2211 c (0) i J0(\u03bb (0) i x) = 1\u2212 x 2 (18)\nand \u03bbi are the zeros of the Bessel function J0(x):\n\u03bb (0) 1 = 2.4, \u03bb (0) 2 = 5.5, \u03bb (0) 3 = 8.65, \u03bb (0) 4 = 11.8, . . . (19)\nAccordingly, \u03bb(1)i are the zeros of the Bessel function J1(x)\n\u03bb (1) 1 = 3.8, \u03bb (1) 2 = 7.0, \u03bb (1) 3 = 10.2, \u03bb (1) 4 = 13.3, . . . (20)\nand\u2211 c (1) i J1(\u03bb (1) i x) = x\u2212 x 3. (21)\nSince all the terms under the sum signs in (17) rapidly decrease with increasing r, we put here \u03b8\u20320 = \u03b80(R) = const.\nIt is instructive to stress that for the symmetric (\u03d5independent) part, one can obtain\u2211\nc (0) i = 1, (22)\u2211\nc (0) i (\u03bb (0) i ) 2J0(\u03bbix) = 4, (23)\nthe last condition resulting from (8). In particular, for x = 0, we have \u2211\nc (0) i (\u03bb (0) i ) 2 = 4. (24)\nUnfortunately, the second series (23) converges very slowly (see Appendix A). For this reason, in what follows, we restrict ourselves to only the first four terms c(0)i for which the coefficients c(0)1 and c (0) 2 coincide with the precisely calculated values, and the two remaining ones are selected to satisfy relations (22) and (24). As a result, we obtain\nc (0) 1 = 1.09, c (0) 2 = \u22120.11, c (0) 3 = 0.028, c (0) 4 = \u22120.0075, (25)\nso that \u2211 c (0) i = 1.00 and \u2211 c (0) i (\u03bb (0) i )\n2 = 4.03. As shown in Appendix A, in some respects, these four terms (25) approximate the constant (23) even better than twenty exact coefficients c(0)i ; in particular, the sum of the first twenty terms of the series (24) results in 3.37 instead of 4.\nAccordingly, for anti-symmetric (\u03d5-dependent) part, equation (8) gives\u2211\nc (1) i (\u03bb (1) i ) 3J1(\u03bbix) = 8x. (26)\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\nTogether with (21) in the limit x\u2192 0 it gives\u2211 c (1) i \u03bb\n(1) i = 2, (27)\u2211\nc (1) i (\u03bb (1) i ) 3 = 16. (28)\nRestricting ourselves to the four terms of the series, we again determine the first two coefficients c(1)1 and c (1) 2 equal to the exactly calculated values (see Appendix A) and the two remaining ones due to the relations (27) and (28). This approximation gives\nc (1) 1 = 0.70, c (1) 2 = \u22120.14, c (1) 3 = 0.044, c (1) 4 = \u22120.0089, (29)\nso that \u2211 c (1) i \u03bb (1) i = 2.00 and \u2211 c (1) i (\u03bb (1) i )\n3 = 16.03. As shown in Appendix A, the four terms (29) approximate the linear function (26) even better than the twenty exact coefficients c(1)i not to say that the sum of the first twenty terms of the series (28) results in 84 instead of 16.\nAs a result, we obtain for the potential \u03c8(l) as a function of the distance l along the magnetic field line f = const\n\u03c8(l) = 1\n2\n\u2126B0R 2 0\nc cos\u03c7\u00d71\u2212 f\nf\u2217 \u2212 \u2211 i c (0) i ( l R )\u2212\u03bb(0)i /\u03b80 J0(\u03bb (0) i \u221a f/f\u2217)  + 3\n8\n\u2126B0R 3 0\ncR sin\u03d5 sin\u03c7\n[( f\nf\u2217\n)1/2( 1\u2212 f\nf\u2217\n)( l\nR\n)1/2\n\u2212 \u2211 i c (1) i ( l R )\u2212\u03bb(1)i /\u03b80 J1(\u03bb (1) i \u221a f/f\u2217)  . (30) Here we can put \u03b80 = R0/R = const. Accordingly, the longitudinal electric field E\u2016 = \u2212\u2202\u03c8/\u2202l looks like\nE\u2016 = \u2212 1\n2 \u2126B0R0 c\ncos\u03c7\u00d7\u2211 i c (0) i \u03bb (0) i ( r R )\u2212\u03bb(0)i /\u03b80\u22121 J0(\u03bb (0) i \u03b8/\u03b80) (31)\n\u22121 4 \u2126B0R0 c R0 R\nsin\u03d5 sin\u03c7\u00d7\u2211 i c (1) i \u03bb (1) i ( r R )\u2212\u03bb(1)i /\u03b80\u22121 J1(\u03bb (1) i \u03b8/\u03b80)\n\u2212 3 16\n( f\nf\u2217\n)1/2( 1\u2212 f\nf\u2217\n) \u2126B0R 3 0\ncR2\n( l\nR\n)\u22121/2 sin\u03d5 sin\u03c7.\nHere the following points should be stressed.\n(i) The expression\n\u03c8(r, \u03b8, \u03d5) = 1\n2\n\u2126B0R 2 0\nc\n[ 1\u2212 \u03b8 2\n\u03b820(r)\n] cos\u03c7 (32)\n+ 3\n8\n\u2126B0R 2 0\nc\n[ \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8 3\n\u03b820(r)\n] sin\u03d5 sin\u03c7\nin (17) is indeed the exact asymptotic solution at large distances from the star surface (r \u2212 R) R0 in the dipole magnetic field (certainly, in the limit \u03b8 1). (ii) At large distances (r \u2212 R) R0, the magnetic field lines \u03b8(r) \u221d r1/2 become equi-potential only for the symmetric component of the potential \u03c8. For the anti-symmetric (\u03d5-dependent) part realizing for any oblique rotator with \u03c7 6= 0\u25e6, the longitudinal electric field decreases on the scale\nof the star radius R, not the polar cap radius R0. We emphasize that this effect does not exist for a model of the conical geometry of open magnetic field lines when \u03b80 = const. (iii) As a result, one can obtain for the anti-symmetric component of the potential\n\u03c8(l) = 3\n8\n( f\nf\u2217\n)1/2( 1\u2212 f\nf\u2217\n) \u2126B0R 3 0\ncR\n( l\nR\n)1/2 sin\u03d5 sin\u03c7,\n(33)\nwhere again l denotes the coordinate along the magnetic field line, and we use the dimensionless area 0 < f < f\u2217. As we see, the additional potential drop within the light cylinder \u03c8(l = RL) is the same as the characteristic vacuum potential within the polar cap.

As a result, it produces a significant effect on the motion of particles, which, as is well-known, is described by the equation\ndEe dl = eE\u2016 \u2212 2 3 e2\nR2c ( Ee mec2 )4 .

(36)\nIt should be immediately noted that due to the additional factor R0/R, this component of the longitudinal electric field becomes significant near the surface of the neutron star for the inclination angles cos\u03c7 \u223c R0/R only. Figure 1 shows the values of the Lorentz-factor \u03b3 = Ee/mec2 of a particle accelerated from the surface of a neutron star from the point f = 0.7 and \u03d5 = 90\u25e6 obtained by solving the equation (35) for two values of the pulsar period P = 0.3 s (upper curves) and P = 1 s (lower curves) for small (\u03c7 = 30\u25e6, top) and large (\u03c7 = 85\u25e6, bottom) inclination angles. The dashed lines show the solutions in which the additional electric field (34) is neglected. As we see, the role of the additional electric field becomes noticeable only for almost orthogonal rotators.\nHowever, for us, it is much more important that for pulsars with relatively large periods P \u223c 1 s, i.e. just near \u201dthe\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\ndeath line\u201d, the energy losses of a particle described by the second term in the equation (35) becomes negligible. Therefore, the lower curves in Figure 1 correspond to the electric potential \u03c8(l). For this reason, in what follows, for such pulsars, we can simply put Ee(l) = e\u03c8(l)\u2212 e\u03c8(l0), where l0 corresponds to the particle creation point. For shorter periods P , the particle energy does not reach the maximum possible energy e\u03c8, and subsequently decreases with increasing the distance from the neutron star surface."

            "text": "As is well-known, the effects of general relativity and, in particular, the frame-dragging (Lense-Thirring) effect, under certain conditions, can play a significant role in the generation of secondary plasma near the polar caps of the neutron star (Beskin 1990; Muslimov & Tsygan 1992; Philippov et al. 2015, 2020). For this reason, below, we estimate all possible corrections which can affect the production of secondary particles. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to only the first order in the small parameter rg/R, where rg = 2GM/c2 is the black hole radius.\nStarting from the time-independent Maxwell equation in the rotation reference frame (see Thorne et al. 1986 for\nmore detail)\n\u2207\u00d7 (\u03b1E + \u03b2 \u00d7B + \u03b2R \u00d7B) = 0, (37)\nwhere \u03b1 is the lapse function (\u03b12 \u2248 1 \u2212 rg/R), \u03b2 is LenseThirring vector and \u03b2R = \u2126\u00d7 r/c, we obtain\n\u03b1E + \u03b2 \u00d7B + \u03b2R \u00d7B = \u2212\u2207\u03c8. (38)\nFor \u03c1e = 0, this equation gives \u2207 ( \u2207\u03c8 \u03b1 ) = 4\u03c0\u03c1GJ, (39)\nwhere now the Goldreich-Julian charge density looks like\n\u03c1GJ = \u2212 1 8\u03c02 \u2207k ( \u2126\u2212 \u03c9 \u03b1c \u2207k\u03a8 ) . (40)\nAs we see, the first relativistic correction (1\u2212 \u03c9/\u2126) appears in the expression for \u03c1GJ, where the ratio \u03c9/\u2126 depends on the neutron star moment of inertia Ir \u223cMR2: \u03c9\n\u2126 = Irrg Mr3 . (41)\nThus this correction just corresponds to a small value \u223c rg/R under consideration. To determine the relativistic corrections, we chose the values M = 1.4M for neutron star mass, R = 13 km for that radius and Ir = 150 M km2 for the moment of inertia (Greif et al. 2020). Notably, the characteristic scale of the changes in all the relativistic corrections are R, in contrast, the scale of change in \u03c8 is R0 R. Therefore, one can consider all relativistic corrections as constants, i.e. we can put r = R in (41). The second relativistic correction appears in the expression for the magnetic field flux\n\u03a8 = 2\u03c0|m| sin 2 \u03b8m r\n( 1 + 3\n4 rg r\n) . (42)\nAs for small angles \u03b8m, one can put sin \u03b8m = r\u22a5/r, i.e. to write down\nx2 = \u03a8\n2\u03c0|m|y 3\n( 1 + 3\n4 rg y\n)\u22121 , (43)\nwhere x = r\u22a5 and y = r, we obtain for the curvature radius Rc \u2248 1/y\u2032\u2032xx the following correction Rc,GR = KcurRc, where\nKcur = ( 1\u2212 1\n2 rg R\n) . (44)\nNext, for the polar cap radius R0,GR = KcapR0, we have\nKcap = ( 1\u2212 3\n8 rg R\n) . (45)\nFinally, Eqn. (39) looks now like\n\u03b12\nr\u22a5\n\u2202\n\u2202r\u22a5\n( r\u22a5 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202r\u22a5\n) + \u22022\u03c8\n\u2202z2 = \u22122\u2126B0 c\n( 1 + 3\n4 rg R\n)( 1\u2212 \u03c9\n\u2126\n) .\n(46)\nAs a result, we obtain the general relativistic correction for the symmetric potential \u03c8GR(r\u22a5) = K\u03c8\u03c8(r\u22a5) at distances h > R0 over the star surface as\nK\u03c8 = (\n1\u2212 \u03c9 \u2126\n)( 1\u2212 rg\nR\n)\u22121 . (47)\nThus, as expected, we can conclude that the effects of general relativity lead to corrections at the level of 10\u201320 per\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\ncent. Consequently, the corresponding corrections at first glance do not go beyond the uncertainty in other quantities, such as, e.g. the radius and moment of inertia of a neutron star. Nevertheless, below, we include general relativity corrections into consideration since, as will be shown, these corrections lead to a significant change in the rate of production of secondary particles."

Recall that in most cases (see, e.g. Timokhin & Harding 2015), it was assumed that all the photons emitted by the relativistic electron with the energy Ee = \u03b3emec2 are radiated at the characteristic frequency\n\u03c9c = 3\n2\nc\nRc \u03b33e , (48)\nwhich is larger than the maximum of the energy spectrum 0.29\u03c9c (Landau & Lifshits 1971). Below, we show that the very first pairs are produced by even more energetic photons, whose frequencies are several times higher than the characteristic frequency \u03c9c (48).\nIndeed, the spectrum of the curvature radiation (i.e. the energy radiated in the frequency domain d\u03c9 at the distance dl)1\ndI =\n\u221a 3\n2\u03c0\ne2\ncRc \u03b3eF (\u03c9/\u03c9c)d\u03c9 dl, (49)\nwhere\nF (\u03be) = \u03be \u222b \u221e \u03be K5/3(x)dx, (50)\nK5/3 is the Macdonald function, and \u03be = \u03c9/\u03c9c, has a rather long tail. As a result, although a relativistic particle needs to travel a certain distance lrad for the emission of high-energy photons with \u03c9 \u03c9c, the free path length l\u03b3 of a \u03b3-quantum before the creation of a secondary electron-positron pair will be much shorter than for the photons radiated near the maximum.\nSince in what follows, we are only interested in the photons with frequencies \u03c9 \u03c9c, one can use the following asymptotic behaviour of the Macdonald\u2019s function (Abramowitz & Stegun 1965)\nK5/3(x) \u2248 \u221a \u03c0\n2x e\u2212x\n( 1 + 91\n72\n1 x + . . .\n) , (51)\ni.e. consider only the two first terms of the expansion in terms of 1/x.

(52)\nBelow, we need a general expression for an arbitrary\n1 This expression can be easily obtained from a well-known synchrotron spectrum (Landau & Lifshits 1971) by replacing the Larmor radius rL = mec2\u03b3/eB with the curvature radius of the magnetic field line Rc.\ndependence of the energy Ee(l) = \u03b3e(l)mec2 of the emitting particle on the distance l. Assuming that a photon with the frequency \u03c9 \u03c9c can be emitted if the total energy E\u03c9 = \u221a 3\n2\u03c0\ne2\ncRc \u222b l0+lrad l0 \u222b \u221e \u03c9 \u03b3e(l)F [\u03be(l)] d\u03c9 dl, (53)\nradiated above this frequency is equal to photon energy: E\u03c9 = ~\u03c9. Here, \u03be(l) = (3/2)(c/Rc)\u03b33e (l), and l0 is the radiation coordinate. For the constant particle energy \u03b3e = const, we have E\u03c9 = \u221a 3\n2\u03c0\ne2\ncRc \u03c9c lrad \u03b3e \u222b \u221e \u03be F (\u03be)d\u03be. (54)\nIntroducing finally a new variable\n\u03be\u2032 = 2\n3 \u03c9Rc c \u03b3\u22123e (l), (55)\nwe obtain\n\u03be =\n\u221a 3\n2\u03c0\ne2\n~c \u222b lrad 0 dl Rc \u03b3e(0) \u03b34e (l) \u03b34e (0) \u222b \u221e \u03be F (\u03be\u2032) d\u03be\u2032, (56)\nwhere \u03b3(0) = \u03b3(l0) and \u03b3(lrad) = \u03b3(l0 + lrad). Relation (56) determines implicitly the connection between lrad and \u03be. In particular, for \u03b3e = const, we obtain for the radiation length lrad\nlrad =\n\u221a 8\u03c0\n3 ~c e2 Rc \u03b3 \u22121 e\n\u221a \u03be ( 1\u2212 91\n72\n1 \u03be + . . .\n) e\u03be. (57)\nFurther, the free path length l\u03b3 of a photon can be written as (Sturrock 1971; Ruderman & Sutherland 1975)\nl\u03b3 = 8 3\u039b Rc Bcr B\nmec 2\n~\u03c9c 1 \u03be , (58)\nwhere \u039b = 15\u201320 is the logarithmic factor: \u039b \u2248 \u039b0\u22123 ln \u039b0, where\n\u039b0 = ln\n[ e2\n~c \u03c9BRc c ( Bcr B )2( mec 2 Eph )2] \u223c 20. (59)\nMinimizing now the sum lrad + l\u03b3 by the value \u03be, one can obtain the energy of a photon ~\u03c9 = \u03be~\u03c9c producing the first secondary pair. In particular, for the constant particle energy, we have the following relation to determine the value \u03be\n\u03be5/2 e\u03be (\n1\u2212 55 72 1 \u03be + . . .\n) = K, (60)\nwhere K = 4 \u221a 2\n3 \u221a 3\u03c0\u039b Bcr B Rc aB \u03b3\u22122e \u2248 40Rc,7B\u2212112 \u03b3 \u22122 7 . (61)\nHere, B12 = B/(1012 G), Rc,7 = Rc/(107 cm), \u03b37 = \u03b3e/107, and aB = ~2/mee2 = 5.3 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm is the Bohr radius. Accordingly, the total length ltot = lrad + l\u03b3 in this case looks like\nltot = 8\n3\u039b Bcr B\nmec 2 \u03be~\u03c9c\n( 1 + 1\n\u03be\n) . (62)\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\nAs shown in Table 1, even for the characteristic parameters, the most effective frequency \u03c9 = \u03be\u03c9c is indeed higher than \u03c9c (48). As for the pulsars located within \u201dthe death valley\u201d, their effective frequency can be sufficiently higher. In Table 2, we show the parameters K and \u03be for some of these pulsars. Their parameters were taken from the ATNF catalogue (Manchester et al. 2005), and the appropriate Lorentzfactors correspond to the potential drop \u03c8 (30). As we see, for all these pulsars, the effect under consideration can indeed play a significant role. A detailed analysis of all the pulsars located within \u201dthe death valley\u201d will be provided in Paper II."

On the other hand, near \u201dthe death line\u201d, more accurate determination of the free path length l\u03b3 is necessary. This, in particular, is due to the fact that l\u03b3 turns out to be comparable with the radius of the star R, i.e. with the scale at which the magnetic field of the neutron star decreases significantly; this was not taken into account when deriving equation (47). For this reason, to determine the path length of a photon, we will use the exact expression for the probability wl of the photon production at a length dl (Berestetsky et al. 1971) dwl = 3 \u221a 3\n16 \u221a 2 e3B sin \u03b8b ~mec3 exp\n( \u22128\n3 Bcr B(l) sin \u03b8b(l)\nmec 2\nEph\n) dl,\n(63)\nwhere again Bcr = m2ec3/e~ \u2248 4.4 \u00d7 1013 G is the critical magnetic field, and \u03b8b is the angle between the magnetic field B and the wave vector k.

Indeed, since in a not very strong magnetic field B0 \u223c 1012 G, secondary particles at the time of birth move at the angle \u03b8 \u223c l\u03b3/Rc to the magnetic field lines, while their energy \u03b3mec2 is to be one half of the energy of the curvature photon ~\u03c9cur (Beskin 1982; Daugherty & Harding 1983), the ratio of the characteristic frequency of a synchrotron photon \u03c9syn = (3/2)\u03b8\u03c9B\u03b32 to the frequency of a curvature photon \u03c9cur \u03c9syn \u03c9cur = 3 8 B0 Bcr ~\u03c9cur mec2 l\u03b3 Rc (65)\nturns out to be exactly \u039b\u22121.

The main difference is that we analyse the dependence of the number density of secondary particles n\u00b1 on the distance r\u22a5 from the magnetic axis rather than the energy spectrum.\nLet us consider one primary particle moving along the magnetic field line intersecting the star surface at the distance r0 from the axis. It produces dN curvature photons in the frequency domain d\u03c9 at the path dh\ndN =\n\u221a 3\n2\u03c0\ne2\ncRc(h)\n\u03b3eF (\u03c9/\u03c9c)\n~\u03c9 d\u03c9 dh. (66)\nOn the other hand, frequency \u03c9 determines the free path l\u03b3 = l\u03b3(\u03c9) which, in turn, determines the magnetic field line at which the secondary pair is created\nr\u22a5 = ( 1\u2212 3\n8 l2\u03b3 R2\n) r0, (67)\nwhere again r\u22a5 is the distance from the axis at the star surface, and h is the height of the \u03b3-quanta emission. Note that in a dipole magnetic field, this expansion does not contain the corrections \u221d hl\u03b3/R2 (and, certainly, it does not contain the term \u221d h2/R2 as r\u22a5 = r0 for l\u03b3 = 0).\nAs we show below, the leading term in (67) is enough for our consideration. On the other hand, in what follows, to determine with the required accuracy the exponent in the pair creation probability wl(\u03b8b) (63), we use the exact expression for the angle \u03b8b between the magnetic field B and the wave vector k. In a dipole magnetic field, for \u03b3-quanta radiated tangentially at the height h, it looks like\n\u03b8b = 3\n4 r0l\u03b3 R2 f(h), (68)\nwhere the correction function f(h) for \u03b8b 1 is\nf(h) = ( 1 + h\nR )1/2( 1 + L(h)l0 R + h R )\u22121 . (69)\nHere, we introduce by definition another correction function L(h) as\nl\u03b3(l0, h) = L(h) l0, (70)\nwhere\nl0(\u03c9) = 32\n9\u039b\nR2\nr0 Bcr B0\nmec 2\n~\u03c9 (71)\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\nis the \u03b3-quantum free pass length in the case l\u03b3 R with the starting point h = 0. The coefficient L(h) due to the strong nonlinearity of the problem for h \u223c l0 \u223c R should be determined numerically by direct integration (64)\u222b l\u03b3 0 wl(h) dl = 1 (72)\nfor probability wl(h) corresponding to the starting point h at which the photon free pass is equal to l\u03b3 (see Table 2). Certainly, L \u2192 1 for h \u2192 0 and l\u03b3 \u2192 0 (r\u22a5 \u2192 r0). Finally, for the primary particle moving along the magnetic field line, we have\nRc = 4\n3\nR2\nr0\n( 1 + h\nR\n)1/2 . (73)\nAs a result, one can write down for the r\u22a5 distribution of the secondary particles as\ndN =\n\u221a 3\n2\u03c0\ne2\n~c \u03b3eF (\u03c9/\u03c9c) Rc\u03c9 d\u03c9 dr\u22a5 dr\u22a5 dh.

(76)\nWithin approximation (67) we consider, the value of L does not depend on \u03c9 (both free path length l0 and l\u03b3 are mainly determined by the exponent, which both depend on \u03c9 as \u03c9\u22121); therefore, below, we do not take into account the logarithmic derivative \u03c9/L(dL/d\u03c9).\nAs a result, we obtain for the linear distribution of secondary particle n\u00b1 dx\u22a5 creating by one primary particle moving along the magnetic field line with a foot point distance from the axis r0 n\u00b1(r\u22a5) = 3 \u221a 3\n16\u03c0\ne2\n~c R0 R x0 (x0 \u2212 x\u22a5) \u222b H 0 dh R \u03b3e(x0, h)F (\u03be), (77)\nwhere now \u03be = 64 \u221a 2\n27 \u221a 3\u039b Bcr B0\nR3\n\u03bb\u0304R20\n(1 + h/R)\n\u03b33e (x0, h) L(x0, x\u22a5, h) x0 \u221a x0 \u221a x0 \u2212 x\u22a5 . (78)\nHere, we introduce by definition two dimensionless parameters\nx0 = r0 R0 ; x\u22a5 = r\u22a5 R0 . (79)\nAs for the upper integration limit H, it can be set equal to infinity, since, as shown in Table 3, the parameter L introduced above increases rapidly with increasing h. Therefore, already at h \u223c H, the integrand becomes exponentially small due to the large value of the argument \u03be (78).\nIn Figure 2, we show secondary particle distributions n\u00b1(r\u22a5) (77) generated by single primary particles with the starting points x0 = 0.4, x0 = 0.6 and x0 = 0.8 for P = 1 s, B12 = 1 and \u03c7 = 0\u25e6. The energy of the primary particles Ee = \u03b3bmec2 was determined from the vacuum potential \u03c8 (30). As we see, even though the maximum of the distribution n\u00b1(r\u22a5) lies near r0 (i.e. the corresponding secondary\nparticles are born on practically the same field line as the primary particle), this distribution slowly decreases with increasing distance r0\u2212r\u22a5. Consequently, with the parameters considered here, which are close to \u201dthe death line\u201d, a significant part of the secondary particles will be produced at distances h, comparable to the radius of the star R. That is why we do not consider further the production of secondary plasma associated with the synchrotron radiation of secondary particles.\nOn the other hand, it is clear that n\u00b1 = 0 for x\u22a5 = x0. As for the position of the maximum in the distributions n\u00b1, they can be easily determined by setting argument (78) as \u03be = 1 so that F (\u03be) becomes exponentially small for \u03be > 1. Moreover, using the potential \u03c8 (30) to determine \u03b3b, one can write down the condition \u03be = 1 as\n(x0 \u2212 x\u22a5) = x\u221230 A, (80)\nwhere\nA = 2 7 39 \u039b2 B2cr B20 R6 \u03bb\u03042R40 \u03b3\u22126b \u2248 6\u00d7 10 \u22125P 14B\u2212812 .

The right shifted distribution corresponds to multiplicity \u03bbGR(x0) presented in Table 4.\nis in good agreement with our numerical result. Using now relation (75), we obtain that the smallest free path length l\u03b3,min = 2 \u221a\n2\u221a 3 A x20 R (82)\ncorresponds to 0.01R \u223c R0. Finally, Table 4 shows how the multiplicity \u03bb (i.e. the total number of secondary particles ne = n+ + n\u2212 per one primary particle) depends on the position r0 = x0R0. As one can see, taking into account the effects of general relativity leads to a significant (by several times) increase in the production rate of secondary particles. Therefore, it seems necessary to include the effects of general relativity in the consideration of the processes of the production of secondary particles near \u201dthe death line\u201d.\nAs was already mentioned above, the beginning of the cascade can be initiated by the cosmic gamma background producing 105\u2013108 primary particles per second in the polar cap region (Shukre & Radhakrishnan 1982). If the primary particles have 2D spatial distribution dNprim = nprim(r0, \u03d5)r0dr0d\u03d5, we obtain for the 2D number density of the secondary pairs n\u00b1(r\u22a5, \u03d5)\nn\u00b1 =\n\u221a 3\n2\u03c0\ne2\n~c \u222b R0 r\u22a5 r0dr0 \u222b H 0 dh \u03b3eF (\u03c9/\u03c9c) Rc\u03c9r\u22a5 d\u03c9 dr\u22a5 nprim. (83)\nFinally we obtain for n\u00b1(r\u22a5, \u03d5)\nn\u00b1 = 3 \u221a 3\n16\u03c0\ne2\n~c R0 R \u222b 1 x\u22a5 x20dx0 x\u22a5(x0 \u2212 x\u22a5) \u222b H 0 dh R \u03b3e(x0, h)F (\u03be)nprim.\n(84)\nIn Figure 4, we show the 2D distribution of the effective secondary particle multiplicity \u03bb(x\u22a5) = (n+ + n\u2212)/nprim (84) generated by the primary particles with the homogeneous distribution nprim = 1 for an ordinary pulsar (P = 1\ns, B12 = 1, \u03c7 = 30\u25e6). The right shifted distribution corresponds to the multiplicity \u03bbGR(x0) presented in Table 4. The fitting curves for x\u22a5 1 correspond to asymptotic behaviour n\u00b1 \u221d x3\u22a5 (see Andrianov et al., in preparation), which, as we see, are satisfied with good accuracy. As expected, the 2D distribution \u03bb(x\u22a5) is shifted left relative to the distribution \u03bbGR(x0), since, as was shown in Figure 2, secondary particles are born closer to the magnetic axis compared to the position of the primary particle (x\u22a5 < x0)."

            "text": "Let us note straight away two essential circumstances. At first, for the formation of a particle production cascade, secondary electron-positron pairs corresponding to the most energetic \u03b3-quanta must be produced in the region of a sufficiently strong longitudinal electric field E\u2016 so that one of the produced particles can stop and then be accelerated in the opposite direction (i.e. inwards to the star surface). For ordinary pulsars, this occurs at distances from the star\u2019s surface h Rcap, where the very existence of a longitudinal electric field is beyond doubt (Ruderman & Sutherland 1975; Arons 1982).\nHowever, near \u201dthe death line\u201d, the free path length l\u03b3 of \u03b3-quanta propagating outwards become much larger than the size of the polar cap. Therefore, secondary particles begin to be born at the distances from the star surface h Rcap where the longitudinal electric field, as was previously assumed, practically vanishes. However, as was shown, in a real dipole geometry, the longitudinal electric field also exists at large distances. It turns out that such an additional longitudinal field Eadd\u2016 (34) is sufficient to stop the particles at the distances h \u223c R from the star surface.\nIndeed, as one can easily show by passing to a reference frame in which \u03b3-quantum propagates perpendicular to the external magnetic field, after an almost instantaneous transition to the lower Landau level, the energy of the secondary particles can be written as \u03b3\u00b1mec2, where \u03b3\u00b1 = \u03b8\u22121b , i.e.\n\u03b3\u00b1 \u223c Rc l\u03b3 . (85)\nTherefore, before stopping, one of the secondary particles must pass the length\n\u03b4l = \u03b3\u00b1mec\n2\neE\u2016 . (86)\nIt gives\n\u03b4l R \u223c Rc l\u03b3\nmec 2 eE\u2016R \u2248 A\u22121 R l\u03b3 R2c2 \u2126\u03c9BR4cap\n( l\nR\n)1/2 , (87)\nwhere A = 3/16(f/f\u2217)(1\u2212f/f\u2217) \u2248 0.1, \u03c9B = eB0/mec, and we used the relation Rc \u2248 R/Rcap(f/f\u2217)\u22121/2. As a result, we obtain\n\u03b4l R \u223c A\u22121R l\u03b3 c \u03c9BR\n( \u2126R\nc\n)\u22123 \u223c 10\u22122P 3B\u2212112 , (88)\nso that the stop length \u03b4l is, indeed, much less than the free pass l\u03b3 \u223c R. Therefore, in what follows, we assume that one of the secondary particles begins its reverse motion at the point of its birth.\nHere, however, one should pay attention to the fact\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\nthat the additional longitudinal electric field Eadd\u2016 works effectively only on that part of the polar cap which is located closer to the rotation axis (sin\u03d5 > 0 for \u03c7 < 90\u25e6 and sin\u03d5 < 0 for \u03c7 > 90\u25e6). In the other parts of the open field lines, where the opposite inequalities are made, the direction of the additional longitudinal electric field will be opposite to the electric field near the star surface. In particular, for sin\u03d5 = 0, there is no additional longitudinal electric field Eadd\u2016 at all.\nFinally, we note one more circumstance which significantly distinguishes the processes of pair creation by \u03b3quanta moving towards the star compared to the case of moving from the star\u2019s surface considered above. The point is that, as shown in Figure 1, the particles moving from the surface of a star are accelerated on a scale R0 R, so that the free path length of \u03b3-quanta can be comparable to the radius of the star. On the other hand, the particles moving towards the star gain most of the energy only near the very surface. Therefore, the free path length of \u03b3-quanta should be of the order of R0.\nAs was shown above, the energy of the particles E(h) moving towards the star can be written with good accuracy in the form\nE(h) = e \u03b4\u03c8(h), (89)\nwhere, according to (30),\n\u03b4\u03c8(h) = 1\n2\n\u2126B0R 2 0\nc P(rm, \u03d5m)f(h). (90)\nHere, P(rm, \u03d5m) = ( cos\u03c7+ 3\n4 rm R sin\u03c7 cos\u03d5m\n)( 1\u2212 r 2 m\nR20\n) , (91)\nand\nf(h) \u2248 exp (\u2212\u03bb1h/R0) , (92)\nwhere \u03bb1 \u2248 2.5. The ability to replace the sum of the power functions (r/R)\u2212\u03bb/\u03b80 in (17) with the exponential term exp(\u2212\u03bb1h/R0) is shown in Figure A3.\nUsing the expression for the free pass length l\u03b3 (58) with the energy of the curvature \u03b3-quanta\n~\u03c9c = 3 2 \u03be ~c Rc ( E(h) mec2 )3 (93)\nand the correction factor \u03be from (56), we can finally write down the condition of the pair creation over the star surface\nl\u03b3(h) < h, (94)\nwhich can be rewritten as\nx > B exp(3\u03bb1x). (95)\nHere x = h/R0,\nB = 2048 81\u039b\u03bef 9/2 \u2217\nR2 \u03bb\u03042 c4\n\u03c94BR 4\n1\nx20\n( \u2126R\nc\n)\u221215/2 P\u22123, (96)\nand we again use standard definition (15) for the dimensionless polar cap area f\u2217. If inequality (94) is violated, then the free path length l\u03b3 becomes greater than the height above the surface of the neutron star h at which it was generated. In this case, \u03b3-quantum does not have time to give birth to a pair before it collides with the surface.\nAs a result, the condition in which secondary particles will be produced both for the primary particles accelerated from the stellar surface and for the opposite motion) can be written down as2\nB < 0.05, (97)\nwhich gives the following evaluation for the maximum period Pmax\nPmax = 0.8B 8/15 12 x 4/15 0 P 2/5 s. (98)\nA value of 0.8 seconds corresponds to R = 12 km, \u039b = 15, \u03be = 3 and f\u2217 = 1.6. As one can see, a rather strong dependence of the limiting period Pmax on the magnetic field B12 makes it easy to explain the observed periods in the range of several seconds. A detailed study of this issue, as was already noted, will be carried out in Paper II."

As is well-known, in reality, we have not \u201dthe death line\u201d, but \u201dthe death valley\u201d on the P \u2212 P\u0307 diagram, which, apparently, is related to the tail of the distribution on some physical parameters. What parameters determine this band will be the subject of Paper II.\nAs for Paper I, we started from our main assumption that near \u201dthe death line\u201d, the polar regions are almost completely free of plasma. This made it possible to accurately determine the potential drop in the area of open field lines. In particular, it was shown that in a dipole magnetic field in the region of open field lines, there is a longitudinal electric field which can stop secondary particles even at sufficiently large distances h \u223c R from the surface of the star. To date, this property has not been known.\nIn addition, the corrections related to the effects of general relativity were determined. As expected, they turned out to be at the level of 10\u201320 per cent, i.e. at the same level of uncertainty which can be assumed in other quantities, such as the radius and moment of inertia of a neutron star. Nevertheless, due to the strong dependence of the production rate on the energy of primary particles, taking into account the effects of general relativity leads to a significant (several times) increase in the multiplicity of particle production \u03bb. Therefore, in this work, they were included into consideration. Looking into the future, we immediately note that it can be expected that the spread in such quantities as the radius of the star R and the size of the polar cap R0 (and, certainly, the curvature radius of magnetic field lines Rc) should also lead to a noticeable expansion of \u201dthe death line\u201d. Paper II will be devoted to the analysis of all these issues.\nFurther, the question of the spatial distribution of the secondary particles produced by curvature photons was investigated in detail (as to synchrotron photons, we assume that near \u201dthe death line\u201d, they are not efficient in the production of secondary pairs). First of all, it was shown that a\n2 When B = 0.05, we have a single root at h = 0.13R0.\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\ncertain role in the production of secondary plasma can play \u03b3-quanta, the energy of which is several times higher than the energy of the maximum of the spectrum 0.44(~c/Rc)\u03b33. This effect becomes especially important for the curvature \u03b3-quanta propagating towards the neutron star surface. As a result, conditions (98) for the termination of the cascade were formulated quantitatively. A detailed analysis of the dependence of \u201dthe death line\u201d both on the parameters of a neutron star and on the possible existence of a nondipole magnetic field is to be carried out in Paper II.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nThe data underlying this work will be shared on reasonable request to the corresponding author."

In Figures A1\u2013A2 we show how the expansions in Bessel functions (18) and (21) approximate the functions 1 \u2212 x2 and x \u2212 x3. The top pannels show an approximation when we restrict ourselves to only the first four terms ci (25) and (29), for which the coefficients c1 and c2 coincide with the precisely calculated values\nc (0) i =\n2\nJ21 (\u03bb (0) i )\n\u222b 1 0 x(1\u2212 x2)J0(\u03bb(0)i x)dx, (A1)\nc (1) i =\n2\nJ22 (\u03bb (1) i )\n\u222b 1 0 x(x\u2212 x3)J1(\u03bb(1)i x)dx, (A2)\nand the two remaining ones are selected to satisfy relations (18) and (21). Accordingly, the approximations by the first twenty terms of the series are shown in the bottom ones. As we see, both series reproduce the functions 1\u2212x2 and x\u2212x3 with high accuracy. As for their second derivatives (23) and (26), in some respects, our first four terms approximate these functions even better than twenty exact terms.\nFinally, in Figure A3, we present the comparison of the dimensionless parallel component of the electric field E\u2016 = \u2212(\u2207\u03c8B)/B/(\u03c80/R0) calculated for cylindrical and conical geometries for P = 1 s, B12 = 1, and \u03c7 = 0\u25e6.

Moreover, good enough agreement is achieved using only the first exponential term (dash line). In turn, this confirms the possibility to write down the condition for the presence of a cascade of secondary plasma production (i.e. the condition that secondary particles will be produced both for primary particles accelerated from the stellar surface and for the opposite motion) as (107).\nMNRAS 000, 000\u2013000 (0000)\nFigure A1.
