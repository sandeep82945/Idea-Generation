1. **Investigate the effect of different ionic liquids on the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study used 1-n-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the ionic liquid, but other ionic liquids may have different effects on the reaction. For example, ionic liquids with different cations or anions may have different affinities for CO2, which could affect the rate and selectivity of the reaction.


2. **Explore the use of different metal porphyrins as catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study used cobalt porphyrin as the catalyst, but other metal porphyrins may also be effective. Different metal porphyrins may have different activities and selectivities for the reaction, and they may also be more stable under different reaction conditions.


3. **Investigate the effect of different reaction conditions on the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study was conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, but other reaction conditions may also be possible. For example, higher temperatures or pressures may increase the rate of the reaction, and different solvents may also affect the reaction.


4. **Develop new in-situ characterization techniques to study the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study used in-situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to study the reaction, but other techniques may also be useful. For example, in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy or in-situ mass spectrometry could provide additional information about the reaction mechanism and intermediates.


5. **Design and develop new electrochemical cells for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.** The study used a conventional three-electrode cell, but other cell designs may be more efficient or practical. For example, flow cells or membrane-electrode assemblies may be better suited for large-scale applications.
