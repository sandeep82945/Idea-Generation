A significant number of such active cells have been already introduced in the literature, and they have been employed in several applications, including filters, capacitance multipliers, inductance emulators and oscillators [1\u20133, 13, 17, 18, 20, 22, 28, 29, 31, 34, 35]. One of the requirements that VCII must fulfill is the extremely low resistance at its terminals Y and Z. The topology in [29] offers such features with relatively low circuit complexity, but it suffers from the different dc levels at these terminals. There are also applications where external resistors could be substituted by the inherent (i.e., parasitic) resistance of the terminal Y, providing electronic adjustment capability of the derived structures, which is an attractive feature of nowadays systems. The VCII structures in [2, 17, 18] offer electronic adjustable parasitic impedance at node Y, but they suffer from the non-zero resistance at the output terminal Z and, also, from the increased circuit complexity. The VCII topology in [32] offers a relatively simple circuitry with electronically controlled resistance at node Y and an extremely low resistance at terminal Z, but the problem there is that the terminal Z is at a different dc level than that of the other terminals of VCII. A relatively simple VCII structure which offers extremely low resistances at both terminal Y and Z, without having different dc levels between these terminals, is presented in this work. An attractive feature of this topology is that it can be easily transposed into an electronically controllable structure, just by changing the point where the Y terminal is fed, providing design flexibility and versatility. This is achieved without losing the aforementioned features.\nThe paper is organized as follows: the basic structure is presented in Sect. 2, where possible enhancements for further increasing its usefulness are also provided. The performance of the proposed core is evaluated and compared with that of the already published relevant structures in Sect. 3 in order for the added value to be evident. A programmable multi-phase sinusoidal oscillator (MSO) topology and a first-order low-pass filter design are presented and evaluated in Sect. 4, as design examples."

            "heading": "2.1 Proposed Topology of FVF-BasedVCII",
            "text": "The symbol of a VCII is provided in Fig. 1, and the matrix equation which describes its behavior is the following:\n\u23a1 \u23a3 iX \u03c5Z \u03c5Y \u23a4 \u23a6 = \u23a1 \u23a2\u23a3 \u00b1\u03b1 1 rX // 1 CX s 0 0 \u03b2 rZ rY 0 0 \u23a4 \u23a5\u23a6 \u00b7 \u23a1 \u23a3 iY \u03c5X iZ \u23a4 \u23a6 . (1)\nThe current conveying operation in (1) between terminals Y and X is described by the factor +\u03b1 for a VCII+, and by the opposite one in the case of a VCII-; the factor \u03b2 describes the voltage conveying operation between terminals X and Z. In addition,\nCX are rX are the inherent (parasitic) capacitance and resistance associated with the terminal X, and rY , rZ are the inherent resistances of terminals X and Z, respectively. For an ideal VCII, i.e., \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 1, rY = 0, rX \u2192 \u221e, rZ = 0, and CX = 0.\nThe FVF is an attractive stage for achieving the goal of the minimum input resistances at nodes Y and Z, and this is originated from the fact that the implemented resistances are scaled versions of the basic resistance 1/gm , with gm being the transconductance parameter of a MOS transistor [4]. Such a topology with nMOS-pMOS conversion, introduced in [29], is depicted in Fig. 2.\nThanks to the employment of FVF in stages associated with the terminals Y and Z, the corresponding inherent resistances are\nrY 1 gm,Mp1 ( gm,MP5 \u00b7 r0,Mp1 ) , (2)\nrZ 1 gm,Mp2 ( gm,MP7 \u00b7 r0,Mp2 ) . (3)\nInspecting (2)\u2013(3), it is readily obtained that the \u201ceffective\u201d transconductance seen from terminals Y and Z is scaled by a factor gmr0, and therefore, the corresponding input resistances are reduced by the same factor. This is a benefit with regard to the convectional way for implementing the required ac ground at terminal Y as well as the voltage conveying between terminals X and Z, where a differential-pair in cascade connection with a voltage follower have been employed, offering inherent resistances equal to 1/gm at these terminals. It must be pointed out that reduced values of 1/gm can be implemented by these stages, but the values of the dc bias currents of these stages must be significantly increased making the power dissipation of the active cell not reasonable for practical applications. The inherent resistance at terminal X is:\nrX = r0,Mn3//r0,Mp6 . (4)\nA practical problem that occurs in the topology of Fig. 2 is related to the dc levels of the terminals voltages. More specifically, the dc level at terminal Y is determined by the value of the extra dc supply voltage connected at the gate of Mp1, being equal to VB\nplus a source-gate voltage. Owing to the high-impedance nature of terminal X and the fact that the current flowing through this terminal at dc operation is equal to zero, the dc voltage at this terminal is determined by the external circuit. The voltage at terminal Z will be equal to that at terminal X increased by a source-gate voltage, limiting the maximum amplitude of the signal that it could be handled without distortion by the VCII.\nIn order to overcome this obstacle, the proposedmodification of the topology in Fig. 2 is demonstrated in Fig. 3a. The dc voltage at terminal X is shifted up by the sourcegate voltage of Mp9 and taking into account that both Mp9 and Mp2 are fed by the same dc current and they have common gate connection, the dc voltage at terminal X is restored back at terminal Z. The corresponding expressions of the inherent resistances given by (2)\u2013(4) are still valid for the modified topology. The price paid for this improvement is that an extra branch constructed from three transistors is required, increasing also the power dissipation of the circuit by a term equal to (VDD \u2212 VSS)I0. Also, the minimum supply voltage requirement is increased by a factor VDS,sat, being equal to |VTHp| + 2VDS,sat, with |VTHp| being the (absolute) value of the threshold of a pMOS transistor and VDS,sat being the minimum gain-overdrive voltage of MOS transistors for entering in the strong inversion region of operation. In addition, due to the absence of a diode-connected MOS at terminal Y, the level of \u03c5Y is sensitive to variations in process, voltage and temperature (PVT) and this is s a disadvantage, comparedwith the op-amp-based input stage. Considering a typical twin-well process, the proposed topology preserves the feature for being immune from the body effect. The corresponding implementation of a VCII- is demonstrated in Fig. 3b."

This is demonstrated in Fig. 5a and, assuming operation of MOS transistors in the strong inversion region, the resistance associated with terminal Y is given by (5)\nrY 1 gm,Mp5 .

This circuit will be mentioned hereinafter as current-controlled VCII (CCVCII), in correspondence with the notation of a current-controlled second-generation current conveyor (CCCII), where the inherent resistance at node X is electronically controllable. The associated symbol of the CCVCII is depicted in Fig. 5b.\nThis topologywould be useful in the cases where only an external resistor is connected at the terminal Y of the VCII, in the sense that it can be implemented by directly feeding the cell by the applied excitation without the requirement for employing an extra resistor."

More specifically, the dc level at node Z is increased by a gate-source voltage with regard to the established one at terminal X.

Such VCII structure has not yet been published in the literature as its easily derived from Table 3."

The proposed scheme of a VCII-based MSO is demonstrated in Fig. 8, where the intermediate stages realize the voltage transfer function of a first-order low-pass filter\nH(s) = \u2212 R1 R2\n1\nR1C1s + 1 . (6)\nIn the case of the activation of switch controlled by \u03c6 activation, a MSO with odd number of phases is realized, while in the case of \u03c6\u0304 activation an even number of phases will be offered. In both cases, the open-loop gain is given by (7)\nL(s) = \u2212 (\nR1/R2 R1C1s + 1\n)n . (7)\nIn order to produce and sustain sinusoidal oscillations, the transfer function in (7) must satisfy the Barkhausen criteria, and therefore, the frequency of oscillation as well as the start-up oscillation condition will be\n\u03c9osc = 1 R1C1 tan (\u03c0 n ) , (8)\nR1 R2\n\u2265 \u221a 1 + tan2 (\u03c0 n ) . (9)\nInspecting (9), it is readily seen that the oscillation condition can be set by changing R2 without disturbing the frequency of oscillation. In other words, the frequency of oscillation can be determined through the time-constant of the low pass filters without disturbing the gain. Theminimum number of odd stages, and therefore of phases that will be implemented, must fulfill the condition n \u2265 3, while a number of n \u2265 4 even stages is capable of being realized by the topology in Fig. 8. This is originated from the fact that the phase shift that could be realized by each intermediate stage is less than 90\u25e6. The phase shift introduced by each filter stage is equal to \u03c0/n.\nUsing (8)\u2013(9), the derived design equations for n=3, 4 become\n\u03c9osc = \u221a 3\nR1C1 ,\nR1 R2 \u2265 2 , (10)\n\u03c9osc = 1 R1C1 , R1 R2\n\u2265 \u221a2 . (11)\nWith regard to the relevant literature, only single-phase VCII-based oscillator topologies have been already published in [28] and, therefore, the topology in Fig. 8 is the first VCII-based multi-phase oscillator, introduced in the literature. It must be mentioned at this point that multi-phase oscillators suitable for implementing both even and odd number of phases have been already introduced in the literature [12].\nAs a second design example, the implementation of an electronically controlled first-order low-pass filter, using the CCVCII as active element, will be demonstrated. Using (5), the topology given in Fig. 9 realizes the transfer function\nH(s) = \u2212 1 C1\ngm,Mp5 s + 1 . (12)\nAccording to (12), the -3dB cut-off frequency is given by the formula: \u03c9\u22123dB = gm,Mp5/C1 and, therefore, it is electronically adjusted through the dc bias current. It must be mentioned at this point that by adding an external resistor at terminal X, then the topology will act as a trans-resistance filter [33] with its output being obtained at terminal Z."

The MOS transistors have the aspect ratios given in Table 4. The electronic tuning capability of the resistance rY is demonstrated in Fig. 16, where the bias current (I0) is varied within the range where the MOS transistors are operate in the strong inversion region. The resulted values of resistance are in the range [1.14,41] k . The obtained magnitude and phase frequency responses for bias currents {1 \u00b5A, 10 \u00b5A, and 20\u00b5A},which correspond to transconductance values {24.37\u00b5S, 192.17\u00b5S, 327.19 \u00b5S}, and C = 1 nF, are depicted by the plots in Fig. 17, with the corresponding theoretically predicted ones given by dashes. The values of the cut-off frequencies are 3.91 kHz, 30.8 kHz, 51.2 kHz and, as they are close to the theoretically expected values 3.88 kHz, 30.6 kHz, 52.1 kHz they confirm the electronic adjustment capability of the characteristic frequency of the filter. As the capacitor value is very large, it cannot be implemented on silicon. As a result, an external capacitor will be utilized for implementing the presented scheme. The time-domain behavior of the filter is evaluated for a 5 \u00b5A, 30.8 kHz sinusoidal input signal in the case of the bias current I0=10 \u00b5A. The derived output waveform, along with the input waveform, are demonstrated in Fig. 18a, and the values of the gain and output-input phase difference are \u22123.1 dB and 136.3\u25e6, with the theoretically expected values being \u22123 dB and 135\u25e6, respectively. In addition, the linear performance of the filter (for I0 = 10 \u00b5A) is evaluated by stimulating it by a 1 kHz sinusoidal signal of variable amplitude. The plot of THD versus the modulation index factor (i.e., the ratio of the amplitude over the input and\nthe value of the dc bias current) is given in Fig. 18b, where it is derived that THD levels equal to 1% and 2% are obtained for modulation index factors 0.6 and 0.84, respectively. The sensitivity performance of the filter, with regard to the effects of the MOS transistors parameters mismatching, is evaluated through the Monte-Carlo analysis tool. The obtained statistical plots related to the maximum gain and cut-off frequency of the filter are presented in Fig. 19a\u2013b, respectively. Taking into account that the values of the standard deviation are 19 mdB and 0.52 kHz, and the corresponding mean values are 0.17 dB and 32.55 kHz, it is concluded that the presented filter structure offers reasonable sensitivity characteristics.\nThe behavior of the filter has been also experimentally verified through the setup depicted in Fig. 20. The obtained responses are demonstrated in Fig. 21a\u2013c. The values of the resistance R1 have been chosen as 41.04 k , 5.2 k , and 3.06 k , in order to be equal to the corresponding values of the inherent resistance rY of the CCVCII for bias currents {1\u00b5A, 10 \u00b5A, and 20 \u00b5A}.

The introduced VCII structure could be also fed into another point, where the small-signal transconductance parameter of MOS transistor is utilized, offering the capability of electronic adjustment of the associated inherent resistance.
