 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate methods to improve gas flow rate accuracy, especially at low-mid range gas volume fractions. The paper noted this was an area needing improvement. Potential ideas could include modifying the sensor configuration or developing enhanced calculation models. 

2. Explore tradeoffs between accuracy, size, and ruggedness to optimize field readiness. As noted, larger vertical separation improves accuracy but increases size. Remote seals aid ruggedness but may reduce accuracy. Studies could optimize these factors.

3. Test the meter on actual field installations to evaluate robustness and identify potential areas for improvement under real-world conditions.

4. Evaluate the meter's performance at wider ranges of temperature, pressure and fluid properties to expand its applicability.

5. Incorporate additional sensors like water-cut meters to provide redundant measurements and potentially improve accuracy through sensor fusion techniques.
