Methods Forty-three eyes with TAO but not DON (as non-DON), fifty-three eyes with DON, and sixty healthy eyes (as controls) were included. Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, refraction, color vision test, intraocular pressure measurement, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, RAPD, exophthalmometry measurements, pVEP test, icVEP test, standard automated perimetry, and clinical activity score classification of TAO, as well as demographic information, were collected and analyzed. Results In the DON group, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value of icVEPs decreased significantly compared with that of the non-DON group as well as control (p < 0.05). The SNR values under 8%, 16% and 32% depth of modulation (DOM) were significantly negatively correlated with BCVA (p < 0.05, r = \u2212 0.9 ~ \u2212 0.6), papilledema (Y/N) (p < 0.05, r = \u2212 0.8 ~ 0.4) and DON (Y/N) (p < 0.001, r = \u2212 0.7 ~ \u2212 0.5). The 8% DOM of icVEP had the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.842) for discriminating DON from non-DONs. Meanwhile, decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that patients clinically benefit most from 8% DOM of icVEP. Furthermore, the 8% DOM of icVEP combing with papilledema (Y/N) and BCVA (Model 1) has significantly larger AUC than the 8% DOM of icVEP (p = 0.0364), and has better clinical benefit in DCA analysis. Conclusions The SNR of 8% DOM from icVEP may represent a significant ancillary diagnostic method for DON detection. Furthermore, icVEP combined with papilledema (Y/N) and BCVA should be considered as a diagnostic model in future clinical practice.",

The exact pathogenesis of DON remains unclear, but it may be closely related to mechanical compression from retrobulbar soft tissues [5]. As an immune-mediated orbital inflammation, hypertrophied extraocular muscle and fat, as well as neighboring orbital inflammation markedly increased orbital, especially apical tissue pressure, lead directly to optic nerve stretching and restriction of blood supply [2, 5, 6]. Without timely diagnosis and accurate intervention, DON patients have a risk of long-term visual function impairment, which makes prompt and accurate prediction and management essential to reduce morbidity and improve prognosis [1].\nDON often presents with decreased visual acuity (VA), impaired color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), papilledema [7], visual field (VF) defect, and abnormal visual evoked potentials (VEP) [6, 8]. However, once these clinical manifestations are discovered, the disease may have progressed to a serious degree of DON and may be irreversible [9].Thus, there is an urgent need for a technique that can help predict, detect and monitor DON at an early stage.\nIsolated-check VEP (icVEP) is a novel technique that prone to records steady-state visual evoked potentials and offers an objective measurement of visual functions preferentially reflecting the function of the Magnocellular pathway (M-pathway) [10, 11]. In humans, M cells have relatively large-diameter axons [11] that could be preferentially damaged in optic neuropathy; thus, icVEP has been widely applied in early diagnosis of visual disorders, such as glaucoma [11\u201314] and traumatic optic neuropathy [15], but never for DON. Given the effectiveness of this technique, we conducted this study to test the hypothesis that [1] the M-pathway is significantly damaged in DON patients and [2] icVEP can be applied as an optimal technique that can provide objective evidence for the early diagnosis of DON.\nKey messages\nDysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON) is an extremely serious complication of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy which could lead to blindness, there is an urgent need for a technique that can help predict, detect and monitor DON at an early stage;\nThe M-pathway may besignificantly damaged in DON patients;\nicVEP can be applied as an optimal technique that provide objective evidence for the early accurate diagnosis of DON."

TAO patients meeting the following criteria were included in the study: [1] age > 18\u00a0years, [2] clear refractive media allowing sufficient image quality, and [3] no treatment with systemic glucocorticoids for at least 3\u00a0months prior to the study. The exclusion criteria for all subjects were as follows: [1] any systemic diseases other than thyroid disorders, [2] any history of ocular surgery or ocular trauma, [3] any ophthalmic diseases other than TAO (e.g., primary glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, high myopia, and uveitis), and [4] any neurological abnormalities that could account for VF changes. DON was diagnosed based on the presence of two or more of the following clinical findings: relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) when unilaterally affected, color visual defect, decreased VA, papilledema, VF defect (mean deviation [MD] in Humphrey perimetry, < \u2212 1.0\u00a0dB), abnormal pattern VEP (pVEP) test (latency delay or/and amplitude reduction)."

The risk threshold is an important parameter when the model is used for decision making, and when this threshold is exceeded, interventions will be taken for the individual. In many prediction studies, researchers generally choose the threshold with the largest sum of sensitivity and specificity as the optimal threshold, but this method is calculated under the assumption that sensitivity\nand specificity are equally important. However, in actual decision-making, the determination of the risk threshold needs to be considered in all aspects, not only the performance of the prediction model under this threshold, but also the cost and damage of the intervention measures. Therefore, people\u2019s attention to true positives and false positives is inconsistent, that is, the weight coefficients is different. In the forecasting model, this weight factor is the \u201cprofit and loss ratio\u201d. The profit and loss ratio is the odds ratio of the risk threshold. Net benefit (NB) is a composite metric that incorporates both true positives and false positives into the calculation. [NB = (NTPNFP*R)/NT; NTP: the number of true positive people; NFP: the number of false positive people; R: profit and loss ratio; NT: the number of true positive people] A predictive model is more valuable for clinical decision-making when it achieves the maximum NB over a broad range of risk thresholds."

The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of the distribution of continuous data. The differences in non-normally distributed continuous variables between two groups were compared using Mann\u2013Whitney U-tests, and categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. In addition, generalized estimation was used to adjust the relationship between icVEP and the parameters (e.g., VF, pVEP, et\u00a0al.), and univariate correlation analysis was performed to assess the associations between various clinical factors and the icVEP parameters. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed using bootstrap resampling (times = 500) and used to determine the discriminatory capabilities of the tests. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for different parameters. MedCalc (version 16.4.3, Ostend, Belgium; www. medca lc. be) was used to compare the AUCs of each model and indicator in a pair-by-pair fashion.

            "text": "The present study demonstrated that icVEP has a promising capacity for discriminating between DON and non-DON eyes; moreover, it has greater sensitivity than pVEP and VF to detect the deficiencies of M-pathway in TAO eyes.\nicVEP is\u00a0a\u00a0potential technique for\u00a0detecting DON\nFirst, the icVEP was designed prone to record cortical activities by afferents in the M pathway, and studies based on glaucoma [11, 12, 14, 21] demonstrated that it can detect minor abnormalities sooner than any other technique since M cells have larger diameter and fewer numbers than the other cells in visual pathway, which make them vulnerable to damage [11, 22], leading us to speculate that icVEP might be a potential technique for detecting early stage of DON.\nSecond, there are several other functional techniques that provide insight into the state of the visual system, including pVEP, multifocal visual evoked potentials, and frequencydoubling technology; however, these either are time-consuming or subject to high individual variability [12, 21]. A single icVEP test can be completed in less than 2\u00a0min, which\nFig. 2 Comparison of icVEP, VF, and pVEP in the diagnosis of DON. (a) Receiver operating characteristic curves for the 8%, 16%, and 32% DOM of icVEP. The AUCs for the 8%DOM, 16%DOM and 32%DOM were 0.842 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.763\u20130.922); 0.788 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.696\u20130.880) and 0.778 (95% CI, 0.686\u20130.870), respectively. (b) Decision curve analysis of six parameters for diagnosing DON. The diagonal light-gray solid line is shown when all patients are considered as having the outcome (which is DON), while the horizontal dark-gray solid line presents when all are considered as not having the outcome; the above two lines represent two extreme cases. On the abscissa line, the red square repre-\nsents the high risk threshold range with highest NB of the red line (SNR 8%DOM), and the light blue square represents the high risk threshold range of the light blue line (MD VF) with highest NB, while the gray square indicates that multiple DCA curves partially overlap or basically overlap the high risk threshold range. The red curve (8%DOM) has widest range with highest NB. (c) Diagnostic power of the SNR (8%DOM, 16%DOM, 32%DOM) of icVEP, PSD(dB), MD(dB), and P100 latent time(ms). The 8% DOM had the largest AUC (0.842) for discriminating DON from non-DON subjects SNR, signal-to-noise ratio; DOM, depth of modulation of the check luminance; PSD, pattern standard deviation; MD, mean deviation\n1 3\navoids the results being affected by excessive patient fatigue. Thus, the objective and efficient icVEP is expected to aid in detection of DON.\nThird, icVEP can examine the functional integrity of central vision at all levels of the visual pathway[14]. In contrast, pattern electroretinogram can test only functional integrity at the retinal level [23], and optical coherence tomography can detect only morphological abnormalities at the retinal level without functional evidence. Thus, icVEP might be a particularly sensitive indicator of a functional deficit in the visual pathway prior to any observable structural damage [12].\nicVEP can distinguish DON eyes from\u00a0non\u2011DON eyes\nWe found that the SNRs obtained with icVEP were significantly reduced in patients with DON compared to\nnon-DON, which is consistent with the previous diagnostic criteria of DON [7], it indicates that icVEP could be used as an alternative technique for diagnosing DON. It may due to the damage of the optic nerve caused by mechanical compression, stretching, and ischemia in DON, thus reducing the retinal transmission to the visual cortex, leading to a decrease in the SNR values of icVEP. The same phenomenon could also be observed in early open-angle glaucoma [24].\nWe also studied the factors associated with SNR and found that most of the visual function parameters were significantly correlated with the SNR values. More importantly, the negative correlation between SNR value and DON indicates that the results of icVEP could reflect the abnormality of visual function. These results further confirm that icVEP could be particularly helpful as an alternative technique for discriminating DON from non-DON.\nFig. 3 Comparison of the diagnostic capabilities of different diagnostic models for DON.

On the abscissa line, the blue square represents the high risk threshold range with highest NB of the blue line (model 2), and the green square represents the high risk threshold range of the green line (model 1) with highest NB, while the gray square indicates that multiple DCA curves partially overlap or basically overlap the high risk threshold range. The blue curve (model 2) has widest range with highest NB\n1 3\nicVEP has\u00a0better diagnostic potential when\u00a0detecting DON than\u00a0VF and\u00a0pVEP\nOur goal was to find a method with high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing DON; therefore, the quantitative comparison between the diagnostic performance of icVEP and that of VF and pVEP was conducted using ROC curve analyses. The current findings suggest that the diagnostic power of icVEP is similar to that of the other two techniques for DON detection when the comparison was based solely on quantitative data.\nIn order to testify the clinical utility of these techniques, we applied DCA for further analysis. Although a model/technique with better discrimination and calibration should theoretically function as a better guide to clinical management, statistical measures (such as ROC curve analyses) fall short when we want to evaluate whether the model achieves clinical utility and improves clinical decision making [19]. To overcome this limitation, DCA was developed to summarize and integrate the preferences of patients or decision makers into the analysis, thus supporting decision-making. Our study shows that the parameters are quite well calibrated, achieving a relatively high AUC. More importantly, patients benefit most from using 8% DOM of icVEP during diagnosis.\nIn addition, we also found that though BCVA, VF, and pVEP of non-DON eyes did not change significantly when compared with controls, SNRs under 8% and 16% DOM showed significant differences, indicating that there might be subtle damages in the M-pathway during TAO (non-DON) stage, and icVEP could detect it earlier and more sensitively. Previous study [25] demonstrated that the contrast sensitivity at all spatial frequency of TAO patients without obvious DON was significantly worse than normal subjects, and a recent study [26] testified that mild TAO patients can have electrophysiological changes that might suggest neural changes in the early disease phase, our study further confirms their theories. Furthermore, we speculate that patients with TAO complained about blurred vision in the absence of decreased BCVA and dry eye, might be caused by early deficiency of M-pathway.\nThe role of\u00a0the\u00a0multifactor combined diagnosis model in\u00a0DON diagnosis\nAs mentioned above, statistical measures sometimes cannot be used exclusively to determine whether use of a model/technique is beneficial in making clinical decisions\u2014especially when one model possesses better discrimination while the other possesses better calibration [27]. Therefore, based on our clinical diagnosis experience and previous study [18], we established two models, compared with using 8% DOM of icVEP, and calculated the ROC curves to confirm their diagnostic efficacy. The results suggest that both models are more effective in diagnosing DON than simply using 8% DOM of icVEP. Since Model 1 and Model 2 have no significant difference when diagnosing DON, we further applied DCA to identify which model might provide more clinical benefit\nfor patients. The data suggest that patients benefit most from diagnosis using Model 2, which includes the most parameters.\nIt is understandable that the combination of more functional parameters that complement each other may greatly improve the ability to detect DON. However, completing all the tests in Model 2 is not only time-consuming but also makes it difficult for patients to cooperate and results in an increased financial burden. In contrast, the test in Model 1 is relatively simple, and time-efficient, and it offers high diagnostic accuracy. In general, when diagnosing DON, both Model 1 and Model 2 present effective diagnostic power depending on different clinical situations; thus, healthcare workers can comprehensively consider which diagnosis model would be most effective based on the disease development and other conditions, such as patients\u2019 health status and economic situation."

[3] In this study, we performed transient VEP(icVEP) to acquire electrical signals from the visual cortex, but it is unable to exclude influence of electrical activities from mental state, emotion, eye movement, and blinking from the subjects; thus, steady-state VEP could be applied in our future study to enhance the study. [4] The DON eyes in our study were not classified by severity, which would partly limit the clinical usefulness of this study. Though the BCVA as well as VF might reflect the severity of DON patients to some extent, the sample size of our study is limited. Thus, further expansion of the sample size and classified by severity in DON patients would greatly enhance the study.
