The synthesis of pure and nickel-doped zinc oxide (ZnO) micro/\nnanorods was done by a simple low-temperature chemical method. Both the as-prepared pure and\ndoped samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy to confirm the proper phase\nformation and the developed microstructure. UV-vis transmittance spectra helped in determining the\nband gap of the samples. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra showed the different\nbonds present in the sample, whereas X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence\nof nickel in the doped sample. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed that after doping, the band-to-\nband transition was affected, whereas defect-induced transition had increased significantly. After the\nnickel doping, contact angle measurement revealed a significant decrease in the sample's surface\nenergy, leading to a remarkably high water contact angle (within the superhydrophobic region).\nSimulation through ANSYS suggested that the doped sample has the potential to function as an efficient\ncold emitter, which was also verified experimentally. The cold emission characteristics of the doped sample showed a significant improvement, with the turn-on field (corresponding to J = 1 mA cm\u22122) reduced from 5.34 to 2.84 V mm\u22121. The enhancement factor for the doped sample reached 3426,\napproximately 1.5 times higher compared to pure ZnO. Efforts have been made to explain the results,\ngiven the favorable band bending as well as the increased number of effective emission sites."

Consequently, the present technological developments are in serious need of harnessing energy. From this point of view, electron eld emission (FE) under an applied external electric eld, also called cold FE, is a matter of great interest. Cold emission, which is basically a quantum mechanical tunneling phenomenon, requires much less energy for electron ejection compared to conventional thermal emission.1 An ideal cold\n, Faculty of Engineering and Computing\nMoradabad, UP 244001, India.

This makes incoming electric ux lines concentrate on the tailored nanostructures, resulting in a huge eld enhancement and low turn-on eld. Also, the material should have moderate work function values, good electrical conductivity, a favorable band structure, and good thermal stability to withstand the Joule heating effect during cold emission.2\u20134 Specic nanosystems like carbon nanotubes, graphene, cupric oxide, cadmium sulde, nickel oxide, tin oxide, and others have shown great potential to be used as cold emitters.5\u201310 Apart from the materials mentioned above, zinc oxide (ZnO), which is an II\u2013VI semiconductor with a wide and direct band gap of about 3.37 eV (at 300 K) and a large free exciton binding energy of 60 meV,11 has emerged as a novel material for cold emission applications.12\u201314 Besides its inherent tendency to grow along a particular direction (c axis) that favors efficient cold emission, the material exhibits remarkable thermal stability, favorable mechanical properties, optical gain, and radiation hardness.15\u201317 Beyond its utility in cold emission applications, the material nds diverse uses in sensors,18 cosmetics,19 solar cells,20 photocatalysts,21 coatings,22 and various other elds.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Thus, this is why there are considerable reports related to the cold emission properties of ZnO. For instance, Q. H. Li et al. reported that tetrapod-like nanostructures are promising candidates for stable FE with a uctuation of less than 2% even aer 72 hours.23 The maximum current density achieved in their work was 18 mA cm\u22122. A study on the thermo-enhanced FE phenomenon from ZnO nanowires was reported by Zhang et al. They reported that under a constant applied electric eld, the eld emission current exhibited a nearly hundred-fold increase accompanied by a signicant decrease in the turn on eld (ETO) as the temperature increased from 323 K to 723 K.24 Y. Lv et al. observed that brush-like ZnO nanowire arrays deposited over carbon cloth offered a remarkably low ETO of 1.02 V mm\n\u22121.25 The system also offered an exceptionally high eld enhancement factor (b) of 64 438. In the previous year, J. Singh and A. Srivastava synthesized ZnO nanostructures using the pulsed laser deposition technique. They observed the stable FE characteristics of the aligned ZnO with a low threshold eld (ETh) of 2.40 V mm \u22121.26\nIn the era of nano-science and technology, it is a very common means that the performance of a specic material in a particular eld of application is made signicantly better by suitable doping, by functionalization or by making suitable hybrids or composites.\nSimilar instances can also be found in the cold emission application of ZnO. In this regard, the work that addressed the etching of ZnO nanorods by Ar plasma, as reported by Ji et al., is worth mentioning.27 Apart from the Ar treatment, ZnO was also coated with a layer of AlN to achieve favorable band bending. Here, ETO exhibited a remarkable 42% reduction to 6.8 V mm\n\u22121, and the hybrid sample reached the highest current density value of 4.1 mA cm\u22122.\nAnother report that addressed the FE from graphenewrapped ZnO came from X. Wang et al. It was shown that the wrapping of the wrinkled graphene structure enhances the FE characteristics of ZnO signicantly,28 resulting in ETO and ETh values of 1.63 and 3.12 V mm\u22121, respectively.\nJ. Chen et al. employed a similar approach of aluminium doping through electron beam evaporation to enhance the eld emission characteristics of ZnO.29 The system gave the best emission characteristics with ETO as low as 6.21 V mm\n\u22121 for optimized layer thickness.\nYoung et al. investigated the eld emission properties of hydrothermally synthesized Ag-doped ZnO.30 When the sample was irradiated with UV light, the doped ZnO gave the lowest ETO with a value of 2 V mm\u22121 associated with a current density of 1 mA cm\u22122.\nAn ETO value of 4.7 V mm \u22121 with a b value of 1686 was obtained from a ZnO rod deposited over silicon pre-patterned by Au.31 In the same study, Lu et al. showed that the screening effect could signicantly deteriorate the emission performance of the system. A. Nagar et al. employed the sol\u2013gel method for the synthesis of a ZnO nanostructure.32 It was shown that the geometry of the ower-like structure signicantly affects the emission characteristics and related parameters such as current density, ETO, and b.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nThe synthesis of Al- and Cu-doped ZnO by a hydrothermal method with varying dopant concentrations was reported by Liu et al.33 Both systems offered good FE characteristics. However, the best result with a turn-on eld of 1.51, 1.80 V mm\u22121 from 6% Al- and 4% Cu-doped samples, respectively, was obtained only aer wrapping the system with a graphene sheet. S. J. Young and Y. L. Chu developed a system of Pd nanoparticle decorated ZnO quantum dots and quantum wires.34 In their case, including Pd did not have a marked effect in changing the turnon eld, but the decorated system showed more than a 100% increase in the enhancement factor. Jun Chen obtained a very high emission current of 20 mA et al. from their developed system of indium-doped ZnO.35 The high emission current was attributed to the high crystallinity and conductivity of the doped sample.\nHowever, the existing studies, though they sometimes provide good FE results, lack other important features required for proper industry-scale applications.\nFor instance, Li et al.23 used a high-temperature synthesis process, while Zhang et al.24 needed additional thermal energy to give the best emission result, indicating that the process cannot be considered to be pure tunneling. The method reported by Ye et al. also involves a high-temperature process, and the value of ETO was also quite high.27 The work led by Cao demonstrated that the screening effect could reduce the FE characteristics of ZnO.31 Though this has fundamental importance, it lacks practical application. The work in 34 showed that including Pd did not affect the emission characteristics much. Though doped ZnO gives a very interesting and useful FE result, it has the same drawback with a high thermal energy required in the synthesis process.35\nIt is also rather surprising that even aer the prediction of ANSYS-based simulation regarding the good potential of nickeldoped ZnO as a eld emitter, there are a negligible number of reports regarding the same. Only Chang et al. developed Nidoped ZnO by a thermal evaporation process, which is a hightemperature synthesis approach. For the optimized system, the required temperature was as high as 1100 \u00b0C.36 Their asgrown different nanostructure was able to give moderately good FE characteristics and offered a turn-on eld of around 1.53 V mm\u22121, which is rather low compared to the present work. But it is also to be noted that they have dened the turn-on eld at a current density value of 0.1 mA cm\u22122, which is 10 times inferior compared to the present work.\nIn 2014, Rana et al. reported on the cold emission of Nidoped ZnO prepared by the wet chemical method. However, they achieved only an 8% reduction of the turn-on eld in their 5% Ni-doped ZnO.37 Also, the article remained almost silent regarding the interaction between the sample and water, where excess hydrophilicity of any electronic components is a considerable problem.\nKeeping this in mind, the present work deals with the synthesis of ZnO nanorods (ZnO NR) by a KMnO4 seedingmediated wet chemical route and doping it with transition metal elements like nickel. The as-prepared pure and hybrid samples were characterized by various sophisticated techniques to conrm their phase, microstructure, doping, and bonding\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 6944\u20136957 | 6945\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

It is shown that both the samples are well luminescent with emission wavelengths lying in the blue/cyan range. It is also seen that aer doping, the characteristics of the sample readily switch over from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic, and the cold emission characteristics are drastically enhanced, with ET and b undergoing a huge enhancement of 2 and 48 times, respectively. As far as the authors are concerned, this is the rst report of a superhydrophobic Ni-doped ZnO-based cold emitter. The enhancement has been explained in terms of eld enhancement on the favorable nanostructure, favorable band bending, and an increased number of defects that come from oxygen vacancies created aer Ni doping.\nThe current article is expected to be a valuable addition to the related literature."

The system was heated at 80 \u00b0C for half an hour. The substrates thus activated were cleaned with DI water and nally dried overnight at 50 \u00b0C. Aer successfully seeding the substrates, they were immersed in a solution prepared by dissolving a certain amount of zinc acetate into DI water. A few pieces of zinc foil were also immersed with the substrates to get a faster reaction. To this solution, NH4OH (25 volume%) was dropwise added under constant stirring till the solution got completely transparent. The system was kept undisturbed for 8 hours.

Sample A has other prominent peaks at 682 and 935 cm\u22121 and a band between 1436 and 1762 cm\u22121. In the case of sample B, the information can be seen at 666, 811, 1088, 1529, 1685, and 1757 cm\u22121. The band in sample A forms due to the overlapping of different C\u2013H, C\u2013C, and C]O bonds, either absorbed or formed during synthesis on the ZnO surface.42 Of all these, peaks at 436 (or 441) and 506 (or 508) cm\u22121 are the signatures of the Zn\u2013O stretching bond,43 of which the peak corresponding to 506 cm\u22121 is Raman active.44 A very strong peak at 935 cm\u22121 in the case of sample A signies a considerable number of O\u2013H groups in sample A.45 Thus there is a probability that this OH group could react with external water droplets, forming a hydrogen bond resulting in its hydrophilic nature, which will be discussed in the coming section. The peak at 682 cm\u22121 in sample A also conrms the presence of a Zn\u2013O bond, whichmay shi and overlap with the peak at 666 cm\u22121, as seen in sample B.46 This peak at 666 cm\u22121, seen in the case of sample B may probably be due to the Ni\u2013O stretching vibrational mode.47 This indirectly conrms the presence of Ni in sample B. The transmittance peak at 1275 cm\u22121 shown in both samples probably comes from the carbonaceous impurities48 or the Si substrate.49 The peaks at 811, 1685, 1088, 1529, and 1757 cm\u22121 appear in the spectra of sample B and bear the signatures of C\u2013H out of plane bending, C]O stretching C\u2013C/ C]C stretching, and C]O stretching modes.46,50\u201352\n3.4.3. Photoluminescence study. The PL spectra of both samples taken under an excitation wavelength of 350 nm are shown in Fig. 6. It is seen that both samples give a peak at an energy of around 2.66 eV with much higher intensity and another peak at 2 eV with lower intensity. Since our samples have an optical band gap in the range between 2.12 and 2.97 eV, there is no doubt that the PL peak at a higher energy value corresponds to a band-to-band transition. The other peaks with lower intensity arise due to the transition between defectinduced states. It is important to note that while both spectra\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nfrom samples A and B exhibit peaks at nearly the same energy values, there are signicant differences in both patterns. For instance, the intensity of the peak at a higher energy value (band-to-band transition) is much less in the case of sample B suggesting lower crystallinity in that sample. The same result is reected in the other defect-assisted peaks.\nRegarding the second peak sample A has an intensity not as high as that of sample B, and in the case of sample B, the peak with higher intensity has much higher broadening. Thus the peak basically gets converted to a broad band. This conrms that sample B is much more defect rich, and it would not be wrong to assume that the defect is mainly due to the oxygen vacancy, as conrmed by the XPS study. This has a marked effect on the cold emission characteristics, which will be discussed in the coming section. The CIE chromaticity diagrams for the doped and un-doped samples are shown in Fig. 7a and b. The CIE (x, y) coordinate of sample A is (0.26312, 0.27115), and for B, it is (0.28452, 0.29641). From the chromatography diagram, it is clearly seen that aer doping, the emission color moves toward cyan from the blue region."

They have shown that aer doping, the intensities of both the XRD peaks associated with (100) and (002) planes increased signicantly as in the present case of nickel doped ZnO.\nIt is reported that in the case of the (002) plane of ZnO, the oxygen atom residing on the surface forms a bond with the hydrogen atom of water with a bond length O(ZnO)\u2013H(H2O) of 1.893 A, and a O(ZnO)\u2013H(H2O)\u2013O(H2O) angle of 172.2\u00b0. In contrast, on ZnO (100) surfaces, oxygen of water forms a strong bond with the Zn atom, to gain the minimum energy conguration and the corresponding Zn(ZnO)\u2013O(H2O) distance is 2.094 A with a Zn(ZnO)\u2013O(H2O)\u2013H(H2O, up) angle of 118.0\u00b0. The higher bond length and lower bond angle always play an important role in gaining enhanced hydrophobicity. Thus, the relative abundance of these two crystal planes may be the key reasons for such enhanced hydrophobicity (in the present case it is ZnO(100)/ZnO(002) = 1.27 and 1.42 respectively for pure and doped samples) along with the other parameters like changes in microstructures, roughness or porosity. However, these needs further studies to be veried.\nThese contact angle data can be used to calculate both the polar (Sp) and dispersive (Sd) components of the surface energy using the equation below:54\n\u00bd1\u00fe cos q \u00bc 2 Slv\nh Sdsv Sdlv 1=2 \u00fe Spsv Splv 1=2 i\n(4)\nHere, q is the contact angle between the solid and liquid, while Slv and Ssv represent the free energies of the liquid and solid phases relative to their respective saturated vapor pressures.\nHere, we have taken Splv = 51.0 mJ m \u22122 and Sdlv = 21.8 mJ m \u22122\nfor water and Splv = 30.0 mJ m \u22122 and Sdlv = 34.0 mJ m \u22122 for glycerol to calculate the surface energy; all the results have been summarized in Table 1.55 The result shows that the polar part of the surface energy governs the water contact, as reported previously.\nThe primary factor contributing to the reduced water contact angle on surface A, as indicated by the FTIR spectra, could be attributed to the presence of a signicant number of OH groups. These groups interact with water by forming unwanted hydrogen bonds resulting in hydrophilicity in this sample."

Aer the modeling, electrical excitation was virtually applied by the soware keeping the range of the excitation voltage as per the actual experimental values. The electrode separation was also xed as used in the real experimental setup. The resulting output electric eld distribution was plotted using an appropriate color code around the proximity of the simulated sample models along with the eld line distribution and shown in Fig. 9a\u2013h.

Fig. 9c, d, g and h are basically the same duo of eld line distribution where transparency is introduced only to show the concentration of the eld over the sharp tips/edges of the nanostructures.\nIt is clearly seen that for the doped sample, the intensity of the applied electric eld is much higher, and at the same time, the eld distribution is much more favorable for the doped sample to function as a cold emitter.\nPropelled by the positive theoretical result, FE measurements were carried out using a laboratory-assembled eld emission setup.

The measurements were performed at a base pressure of \u223c10\u22127 mbar. The interelectrode distance was kept as high as 300 mm.

Hence, the plot of ln {J/E2} vs. 1/E should be a straight line, and its slope and intercept give valuable information about the enhancement factor, local work function, etc. An experimental F\u2013N plot has been modelled, which can be expressed as\nln{J/E2} = ln{raf\u22121b2} \u2212 [{sbf3/2b\u22121}/E] (7)\nwhere r and s are the intercept and slope correction factors, respectively.

There are different possible reasons that alone or collectively can explain the signicant enhancement of the cold emission characteristics of the doped sample.\nFirstly, it is seen that due to Ni doping, there is a change in the morphology of the sample, and unlike in sample A, sample B shows the presence of a few two-dimensional sheet-like structures with sharp edges. These edges have a favorable conguration for the eld lines to be concentrated into it and, thus, overall, have a higher enhancement factor.

It was seen that when the cold emission characteristics of both the samples were taken, the as-grown sample gave much better emission\nite in a wurtzite structure.

It was thereaer concluded that aer annealing, the oxygen defect density decreased, resulting in higher resistivity in this sample, which in turn degraded the FE properties of the annealed sample considerably. Therefore, the higher oxygen vacancies in sample B can be another reason for better FE characteristics in such a sample.\nThe inclusion of Ni on the ZnO lattice results in favorable band bending, as discussed in-depth by Rana et al. in their reported work on the cold emission properties of Ni-doped ZnO.37 Following their explanation, the detailed energy band diagram schematically is shown in Fig. 11a\u2013d.\nDoping of ZnO with transitionmetals like Ni results in a shi in energy levels and an enhanced carrier population in the conduction band of ZnO. In Ni-doped ZnO, Zn2+ ions, located in the middle of the tetrahedron surrounded by four oxygen atoms, get partially replaced by Ni2+ ions. As a result, the d orbital of Ni gets split into a higher triplet (t2g) and lower doublet (eg) state (Fig. 11a) under the crystal eld of ZnO. Aer hybridization, the t2g state interacts with the p orbital of the valence electrons, causing it to split into bonding and antibonding t states (Fig. 11b). The t-bonding state is localized, while the t anti-bonding state has higher energy and is positioned very close to the conduction band. This anti-bonding state has a considerable number of mobile electrons, and there is a huge probability that a slight increase in the number of electrons from this impurity state can facilitate their transition into the conduction band of ZnO. This phenomenon leads to an enhancement in the eld emission (FE) characteristics of sample B (Fig. 11c and d). Thus conclusively, it can be considered that due to the incorporation of Ni, a considerable number of electrons get promoted to the conduction band of ZnO and take part in the FE.\nSimilar results have been theoretically veried by many researchers from DFT studies.\n6954 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 6944\u20136957\nFor instance, Haq et al. computed the density of states of Nidoped ZnO, which is shown in Fig. 12.59\nFig. 12 shows that the VB at a lower energy value is mostly contributed by the Zn-3d state, whereas themiddle energy range contribution comes from Zn-3d, O-2p, and slightly from the Ni3d level. The higher energy value of the VB (\u22122 to\u22121 eV) is solely due to Ni-3d together with the O-2p level. Due to the crystal eld effect of oxygen, Ni 3d states are split into eg and t2g states, as mentioned before, and contributed to the FE characteristics of sample B.\nTable 3 compares the cold emission result of different ZnO nanostructure-based systems to that of our present work.\nIt is clearly seen that the present work gives results comparable to or sometimes even better than other reported results with the further advantage of a large inter-electrode distance and, most importantly, higher relative improvement of the hybrid system comparable to the pure one."

            "text": "The present work concludes that it is possible to enhance the cold emission properties of ZnO nanorods by simply doping them with nickel, with atomic concentrations as low as 2%. Both pure and doped samples were synthesized by a simple wet chemical route and characterized by using various sophisticate tools. XRD conrms the proper phase formation, whereas XPS supports successful doping. XPS further suggests that the ZnO nanorod (conrmed by a FESEM study) contains signicant oxygen vacancies in the case of the doped sample, which has a marked effect on PL as well as on the cold emission properties of the sample. A UV-vis study shows that the doped sample becomes signicantly transparent aer doping, with the band gap reduced from 2.97 to 2.12 eV. Not only that, as conrmed by a FTIR study, doping helps remove the hydroxyl group from pure ZnO, making it superhydrophobic.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Thus the present work successfully reports the synthesis of a ZnO-based superhydrophobic eld emitter.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
