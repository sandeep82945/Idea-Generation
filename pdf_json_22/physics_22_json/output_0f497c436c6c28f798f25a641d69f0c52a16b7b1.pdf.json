    "abstractText": "Ocean mesoscale eddies have an important role in the ocean and affect the underwa\u2010 ter sound speed field (SSF). Many physical models have been proposed for mesoscale eddy three\u2010 dimensional (3D) structure analysis and construction. Here, we propose a model for the reduced\u2010 order representation of 3D SSF with ocean mesoscale eddies. Particularly, the radial basis functions (RBFs), which are guided by the universal physics model of mesoscale eddy in horizontal dimen\u2010 sions, are employed. RBF and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) are used as basis functions for 3D representation. The proposed method is an approximation of the classical Gaussian eddy model in the first\u2010order form. Simulation results confirm the reduced\u2010order representation performance and effectiveness in reconstruction using 136 days of HYCOM data in the northwestward of the South China Sea with a warm eddy and a cold eddy. The proposed RBF + EOF method roughly halves the number of coefficients for mesoscale eddy representation, compared with classical meth\u2010 ods. The reduced\u2010order representation method can be utilized in ocean acoustic tomography and acoustic remote sensing in a mesoscale area.",

            "text": "Improving underwater sensing [1], localization [2,3], and communication [4] perfor\u2011 mance relies on accurate, fine\u2011grained, and agile sound speed awareness. Towards this goal, acoustical oceanography research has put a lot of effort into acquiring the sound speed fields via acousticmeasurements (e.g., ocean acoustic tomography (OAT)) [5\u20137]. SSF inversion by OAT belongs to an inverse problem which is always an under\u2011determined problem in practice [5,8]. In order to reduce the degree of under\u2011determination, the effec\u2011 tive reduced\u2011order representation of SSF and basis functions learning are considered the first step [9]. Historically, the development of SSF reduced\u2011order representation (or basis functions) hasmainly focused on capturing general spatial\u2013temporal variations (e.g., EOFs and Fourier basis functions) [8], while paying little attention to integrating the physics knowledge of crucial ocean phenomena, particularly, the ocean mesoscale eddy consid\u2011 ered in this paper. Ocean mesoscale eddies profoundly affect the heat and material transport across the global oceans [10], thus resulting in varying sound speeds. To characterize the eddies\u2019 physical properties, abundant observation data have been collected using various sensor technologies (e.g., satellites, moorings, gliders, and Argo floats), which facilitate extensive studies in physical oceanography [11,12]. Some studies in the field of ocean acoustics have\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5860. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14225860 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5860 2 of 20\nfocused on developing analytical models of the singlemesoscale eddy (3DGaussian shape, etc.) and acoustic propagation theory through mesoscale eddies [13\u201317]. The parametric model (such as the Gaussian eddymodel [14]) of 3D SSF of themesoscale eddy is powerful and simple and has been widely used in acoustic field calculation and model\u2011based inver\u2011 sion. However, it is designed for single mesoscale eddy representation and is not suitable for complex 3D SSFwith various ocean phenomena, not only for the singlemesoscale eddy. The SSF outside the mesoscale eddy edge is not considered in the above model. The repre\u2011 sentation error of SSF determined by the parametric model has not been quantitatively cal\u2011 culated using reanalysis data. These models are not appropriate for the classical multi\u2011site tomography scheme [18]. Although the statistical characteristics of mesoscale eddies [12] and the physical attributes of a specific mesoscale eddy [11] are well documented in the literature, no work seamlessly incorporates this knowledge into the SSF representation al\u2011 gorithm, which motivates the development of this paper. The use of specific ocean phenomenon knowledge in SSF representation has been pre\u2011 liminarily introduced in some recent works. The thermal front forms homogeneous water near the coast and stratified water off the shore, resulting in a range\u2011dependent temper\u2011 ature field. Feature models (FMs) are used as parameterization schemes for the 2D tem\u2011 perature field of the vertical slices of the temperature field using the range\u2011dependent hy\u2011 perbolic tangent function or exponential function. This method has been used in OAT for ocean front reconstruction and is named feature\u2011oriented acoustic tomography (FOAT) [19]. Although the physical structure of thermal fronts has been considered, the key is FMs\u2011 based EOFs, while no horizontal (range\u2011dependent) structure is used in SSF or temperature field inversion. Feature\u2011oriented ocean acoustic tomography makes use of the structure of SSF with specific ocean phenomena such as front and eddy. The perturbation in the ocean sound field can be simplified related to the fluctuation of SSF model parameters, which is helpful in identifying the model parameters to some degree [20]. This method is suitable for the case where the SSF is dominated by known oceanographic processes. The acoustic signal characteristics are associated with the expected oceanographic main characteristics such as location, intensity, scale, etc. Therefore, the physical\u2011guided 3D SSF representation with mesoscale eddies method is proposed for mesoscale eddy FOAT. In contrast to 2D front\u2011FMs, mesoscale eddies have a typical 3D structure (two\u2011 directional range\u2011dependent and depth\u2011dependent). Mesoscale eddies have a universal structure with an associated pressure anomaly described by Gaussian range\u2011dependent and stretched sinusoidal depth\u2011dependent functions [12]. Inspired by this physical univer\u2011 sal structure, we propose a physics\u2011guided FMs representation method. Gaussian\u2011shaped radial basis function networks (RBF) [21,22] are used in horizontal dimensions\u2019 representa\u2011 tion. Due to the strong non\u2011linear properties of mesoscale eddies, RBF provides non\u2011linear behaviors to attempt to solve the turbulent behavior which is suitable for eddies represen\u2011 tation, while the coefficients of RBF inversion are solved in a linear sense. The links be\u2011 tween RBF and 3D SSF with ocean mesoscale eddies mainly manifest in two aspects. One is that Gaussian\u2011shaped RBF is consistent with the shape of mesoscale eddy in the hori\u2011 zontal dimension. Another is that RBF can be used as general and effective basis functions for SSF interpolation with or without mesoscale eddies. The effectiveness of RBFs as basis functions have been demonstrated in ad\u2011hoc applications [23] such as vorticity representa\u2011 tion [24], current inversion in OAT [25], and well\u2011logging data inversion [26]. In this paper, a 3D SSF reduced\u2011order representation scheme is proposed. EOFs are applied as basis functions in the vertical directionwhile semi\u2011data\u2011driven and semi\u2011model\u2011 driven RBFs are used in the horizontal directions. The radiuses of RBF are trained from historical data, while the Gaussian\u2011shaped RBF is guided following the mesoscale eddies physical model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, HYCOM SSF data with identified mesoscale eddies will be used for simulation. The parameters of RBFs will be discussed in detail. The performance of the proposed method will be compared to the classic spectrum\u2013analytical Fourier method [8] and the newly proposed fully data\u2011driven tensor method [9].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5860 3 of 20\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the data andmethods, in\u2011 cluding HYCOM data, sound speed calculation equation, various 3D basis function repre\u2011 sentation methods, and the RBF\u2011based method.

SSP Representation and EOF The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) is the most widely used basis function in the vertical dimension. EOFs are empirical modes calculated by historical sound speed profiles. It is a pure data\u2011driven reduced\u2011order method. The calculation of EOFs will be described after the matrix definition of 3D SSF. The calculation of EOFs is drawn from the SVD decomposition of a set of SSPs. The commonly usedmethod is to calculate the covariancematrix for principal component anal\u2011 ysis (PCA), that is, eigenvalue decomposition. At first, the mean SSP is calculated.

The truncated SVD decomposition is expressed as XXT \u2248 EK\u039bKETK, where \u039bK = diag([\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbK]) and\nEK = [e1, . . . , eK] \u2208 RI\u00d7K.

The empirical value of K in the literature is 2 to 6 [28\u201330]. The 3D SSF matrix is expressed as\nX \u2248 EKW, (8)\nwhereW \u2208 RK\u00d7MN is the matrix of representation coefficients. Since the EOF matrix EK satisfies orthogonality (e.g., ETKEK = IK), the coefficients matrix can be obtained by\nW\u0302 = ETKX. (9)\n2.2.2. 3\u2011D SSF Representation Furthermore, the orthogonality assumptions are applied for horizontal dimensions in x and y, and we can separate basis functions in x and y, as\nc(x, y, z) = c(z) + Nx\n\u2211 k=1\nNy \u2211 j=1 Nz \u2211 i=1 wijk[F1(x)]k[F2(y)]j[E(z)]i, (10)\nwhere [F1(x)] Nx k=1 is the basis function in the x\u2011axis (longitude) and [F2(y)] Ny j=1 in the y\u2011axis (latitude), with a total of Nx and Ny, respectively.\nA. Spectral\u2011analysis Method\nTwo\u2011dimensional Fourier decomposition is often used to represent the horizontal dimensions of 3D SSF. As horizontal basis functions, Fourier basis are a reduced\u2011order method of spectral analysis, which use exponential basis as structural modes. The 3D reduced\u2011order representation using horizontal two\u2011dimensional Fourier basis and vertical EOF basis can be expressed as\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5860 8 of 20\nc(x, y, z) = NF1\n\u2211 f1=1\nNF2 \u2211 f2=1 KF \u2211 k=1\nw f1, f2,k [ EKF ] z,k\n1D EOF\n\u00d7 exp ( 2\u03c0 j [\nx( f1 \u2212 1) Lx\n]) exp ( 2\u03c0 j [ y( f2 \u2212 1)\nLy\n]) , (11)\nwhere [ EKF ] z,k is the z\u2011th depth and the k\u2011th order EOF. KF is the number of EOFs for z\u2011axis. NF1 and NF2 denote the number of Fourier basis functions for the x\u2011axis and y\u2011axis. For a 3D SSF, {c\u2217(x, y, z)}M,N,Ix=1,y=1,z=1, the representation coefficients {w\u2217f1, f2,k } NF1 ,NF2 ,KF f1=1, f2=1,k=1 can be expressed in matrix form as\nX\u0302\u2217,u = EKFW \u2217FT, (12)\nW\u2217 = ETKFX \u2217,u\n( FT )\u2020 , (13)\nwhere X\u2217,u \u2208 RI\u00d7MN is 3D SSF in matrix form andW\u2217 \u2208 RKF\u00d7NF1 NF2 is the matrix of repre\u2011 sentation coefficients.

Henceforth, the method proposed in this subsection is named Fourier + EOF.\nB. Data\u2011Driven Method\nA fully data\u2011drivenmethod for 3DSSF reduced\u2011order representation is describedhere, which learns all of the basis functions in three directions from data. Assuming the basis functions of the three dimensions are orthogonal to each other, the basis functions can be obtained by tensor decomposition CPD. Here, we use the higher\u2011 order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) algorithm [9]. The specific calculation algorithm can be found in the reference and will not be listed here. The theory insight of orthogonal tensor decomposition shows that it is a universal 3D representation method. The depth basis functions learned from HOOI are the same as EOFs.\nThe decomposition of HOOI can be expressed as\nX = S \u00d71 B(1) \u00d72 B(2) \u00d73 B(3), (14)\nwhere S \u2208 RL1\u00d7L2\u00d7L3 is core\u2011tensor with a size of L1 \u00d7 L2 \u00d7 L3, B(1) \u2208 RM\u00d7L1 , B(2) \u2208 RN\u00d7L2 , B(3) \u2208 RI\u00d7L3 are basis functions in longitude, latitude, and depth, respec\u2011 tively, and\u00d7p meansmode\u2011pproduct.

Here, we use Gaussian RBF which takes the exponential weighted sum of the reciprocal of radial distance as the interpolation function. The weighting function is\n\u03c6(r) = exp(\u2212 r 2\n2R02 ), (16)\nwhere R0 is the width of RBF, representing the range and distribution in the input space.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5860 9 of 20\nIn physical oceanography, the universal structure of a mesoscale eddy is expressed as pn(rn, z) = R(rn) \u00b7 H(z) where R(rn) = ( 1 \u2212 r2n/2 ) \u00b7 exp ( \u2212r2n/2 ) and rn = r/Rm. pn is pressure anomaly, rn is the normalized range, r is the range, Rm is the radius of mesoscale eddy and z is depth. Thus, the horizontal structure of the mesoscale eddy is expressed as\nR(r) = exp ( \u2212r2/2Rm2 ) . (17)\nIn the subsequent discussion, we will use the radius (a concept in the mesoscale eddy model) as the width (a concept in RBF) to emphasize the physical meaning of width.

Random selection refers to a random selection of points among all grid points while regular selection refers to the selection of points in the region that are equally spaced in each direction. In addition, the center of RBF can be learned by clusteringmethods, which is an adaptive self\u2011organized algorithm. If the central positions of the mesoscale eddies are known, this point can be selected. The central position of the mesoscale eddies generally can be obtained from the satellite altimeter data, before taking charge of the underwater 3D SSF data. The width R0 of RBFs is selected as a scalar here, that is, each order of RBF has the same width, as well as isotropic RBFs. R0 is learned from historical data, which is the correlation radius of the SSF. The radius is near the radius of the mesoscale eddy, ranging from 50 km to 200 km. Empirically, the radius can be selected as 100 km. Henceforth, the method proposed in this subsection is named RBF + EOF."

TheGaussian eddy model represents one mesoscale eddy by one\u2011order Gaussian approximation. RBF + EOF is the representation method proposed by us, which can represent and reconstruct the 3D SSF.

Conclusions\nIn this paper, a 3D SSF with mesoscale eddies has been considered by way of re-\nduced-order representation with proposed effective basis functions. The physics of\nmesoscale eddies is connected to the RBF in a seamless physical guide and math-analytical\nmethod. The first-order RBF + EOF representation method is an approximation of the clas-\nsic Gaussian eddy model. Multi-order RBF + EOF is a semi-data-driven and semi-model-\ndriven method combining knowledge in data and in physics.\nThe theory interpretation between 3D SSF with mesoscale eddy and Gaussian RBF is\nshown and tested. The parameters of RBF are assessed in detail. The performance of the\nRBF + EOF method is evaluated using the reanalysis 3D SSF data in the South China Sea\nand compared to other benchmark methods including Fourier + EOF and tensor-based\nHOOI, showing robustness and accuracy in whole days. The results also indicate RBF +\nEOF is relatively better with a lower number of representation coefficients, which will be\nappropriate in acoustical oceanography.\nWe will use the proposed method in OAT for 3D SSF inversion and try to observe\nmesoscale eddies in the South China Sea [33]. Several OAT experiments have been con-\nducted [34] and mesoscale eddies have been captured with sea surface height anomalies\nfrom satellites.
