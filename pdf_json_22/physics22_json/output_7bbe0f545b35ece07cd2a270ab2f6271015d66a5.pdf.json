            "text": "Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are classified as Type-1 and Type2, based on the presence or absence of broad optical/UV emission lines. The simplified unification model of AGNs can explain different types of AGN based on different inclination angles with respect to an obscuring torus (Antonucci 1993). In this framework, the Type2 AGNs are seen edge-on (i.e. through the obscuring torus), while the Type-1 AGNs are observed face-on. Work carried out in the infrared has shown that the molecular torus is likely clumpy, rather than uniform (e.g., Nenkova et al. 2008a,b). The level of obscuration toward the X-ray source is typically parametrized with the hydrogen column density (#H).\nOver the years, many AGNs are observed to show variable #H in a timescale of hours to years (Risaliti et al. 2002). The short-term variations (on timescales of \u223c days) are believed to be associated with the broad line emitting region (BLR), while the long-term variability (on timescales of months to years) are believed to be caused by the clumpy molecular torus (Markowitz et al. 2014). A growing number of AGNs, e.g., UGC 4203 (Risaliti et al. 2010), NGC 4151 (Puccetti et al. 2007), NGC 2992 (Weaver et al. 1996; Murphy et al.\n\u2605 E-mail: argha0004@gmail.com\n2007), IC 751 (Ricci et al. 2016), NGC 6300 (Guainazzi 2002; Jana et al. 2020), have shown variable #H by repeated X-ray observation. In recent years, a new sub-class of AGNs, known as changinglook AGN has emerged. In these objects, the line of sight column density can go from a Compton-thin (#H< 10\n24 cm\u22122) to a Comptonthick state (CT; #H> 10\n24 cm\u22122) level, or vice-versa. These events can lead to a dramatic change in the observed X-ray spectrum, which can go from being reflection dominated (in the Compton-thick state) to transmission dominated (in the Compton-thin state), or vice versa (Guainazzi 2002; Matt et al. 2003). These events are believed to be an important confirmation of the clumpiness of the BLR or torus (Guainazzi 2002; Elitzur 2012; Yaqoob et al. 2015; Jana et al. 2020).\nNGC 4507 is a nearby (I = 0.0118) barred spiral galaxy, classified as SAB(s)ab (Tueller et al. 2008; Winter et al. 2009). NGC 4507 is reported to be one of the brightest ( obs2\u221210 \u223c 10\n\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121) Seyfert 2 galaxies in the hard X-ray band (> 10 keV; Braito et al. 2013), and was detected by INTEGRAL/ISGRI, Swift/BAT and CGRO/OSSE (Bassani et al. 1995; Ricci et al. 2017a). Over the years, several X-ray studies have revealed a variable #H in the range of \u223c 1 \u2212 9 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 based on the observations by Ginga, ASCA, BeppoSAX, XMM-Newton and Chandra (Awaki et al. 1991; Comastri et al. 1998; Risaliti 2002; Matt et al. 2004; Marinucci et al. 2013).\n\u00a9 2021 The Authors\nTable 1.

In the present work, we studied all NuSTAR observations in a energy range of 3\u221260 keV (see Table 1). NuSTAR is a hard X-ray focusing telescope, consisting of two identical modules: FPMA and FPMB (Harrison et al. 2013). Data were reprocessed with the NuSTAR Data Analysis Software (NuSTARDAS, version 1.4.1). Cleaned event files were generated and calibrated by using the standard filtering criteria in the nupipeline task, and the latest calibration data files available in the NuSTAR calibration database1 . The source and background products were extracted by considering circular regions with 90 arcsec radii, centred at the source coordinates and away from the source, respectively. The spectra and light curves were extracted using the nuproduct task. We re-binned the spectra to ensure that they had at least 20 counts per bin by using the grppha task.\n1 http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/caldb/data/nustar/fpm/"

            "text": "We started our spectral analysis with a simple absorbed power-law model with exponential cutoff (zphabs1*cabs*zcutoffpl1). Here, zphabs1 and cabs represent the line-of-sight absorption due to the photo-electric effect and Compton scattering, respectively. The hydrogen column density of zphabs1 and cabs were tied to have the same value. The zcutoffpl1 represents the primary continuum emission. This model did not provide an acceptable fit (j2 = 921 for 598 degrees of freedom or dof). We, therefore, added four components, representing the reprocessed emission (modelled with pexrav Magdziarz et al. 1998) and three Gaussian lines, representing, Fe KU, Fe KV, and Ni KU lines. The pexrav model describes the reprocessed X-ray emission from a cold, neutral, semi-infinite slab. We set the reflection fraction ('refl) to have a negative value, so that pexrav would only represent the reflection component. We linked the photon index, cutoff energy and normalization of pexrav to the values of the primary continuum. We set the iron abundance to one and the inclination angle to 8 = 60\u00b0. Along with this, a scattered component is also observed in obscured AGNs (Turner et al. 1997; Ueda et al. 2007; Gupta et al. 2021). Hence, we included one additional power-law component multiplied by a constant (const*zcutoffpl2). We linked the photon index (\u0393) and normalization of this power-law component (zcutoffpl2) to the values of the primary continuum (zcutoffpl1). The \u2018constant\u2019 represents the scattering fraction ( 5Scat). The line width of the Gaussian components were fixed to 50 eV, 10 eV, and 10 eV for Fe KU, Fe KV, and Ni KU, respectively. The final model reads in XSPEC as\nphabs1 * (zphabs2*cabs*zcutoffpl1 + 3*zgauss + pexrav + const*zcutoffpl2). Here, phabs1 represent the Galactic absorption in the direction of\n2 https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (2021)\nthe source. This model (hereafter the slab model) provided a good fit for all observations. The results show that the X-ray source is highly obscured during all observations, with #H varying in the range 6.3\u00b10.4\u22127.6\u00b10.6\u00d71023 cm\u22122. The photon index was found to be roughly constant (\u0393 \u223c 1.6 \u2212 1.7). The cutoff energy ( cut) was obtained to be constant ( cut \u223c 121+107\u221241 \u2212 135 +58 \u221273 keV) within the uncertainty. We detected strong Fe KU line emission in all four epochs, with a equivalent width (EW) of 237 \u00b1 7 eV, 203 \u00b1 7 eV, 235 \u00b1 8 eV, and 233 \u00b1 8 eV in observations N1, N2, N3, and N4, respectively (see Table 1). The reflection was found be moderate ('refl \u223c 0.4). The results obtained with this model are reported in Table 2. To test if the variability of #H is real and not associated to a degeneracy with the continuum parameters (\u0393 and cut), we fitted all the spectra simultaneously with \u0393 and cut tied together. Using this approach, we found a similar variability of #H . We show the best-fitted unfolded spectra obtained with the slab model in the left panel of Figure 2, while the corresponding residuals are shown in the right panel of Figure 2. In the left panel of Fig 2, the black, red, green and blue solid lines represent the best-fitted slab model for N1, N2, N3 and N4, respectively, while the black, red, green and blue point represent the data for the observation N1, N2, N3 and N4, respectively. Figure 3 shows the confidence contour between the photon index (\u0393) and line of sight column density (#H)."

            "text": "The pexrav model considers reflection from a semi-infinite slab. Hence, it might not provide an accurate representation of the reprocessed radiation in obscured AGN. Thus, to probe the complex absorber, one should consider a more physical torus model. For our spectral analysis, we used the physically-motivated torus model mytorus3 (Murphy & Yaqoob 2009; Yaqoob 2012). This model consists of an absorbing torus, surrounding the X-ray source, with a fixed opening angle of 60\u25e6 (i.e., a covering factor of 0.5). mytorus has three spectral components: the zeroth ordered component (MYTZ), a scattered/reprocessed component (MYTS), and a line component (MYTL). The MYTZ component describes the absorbed transmitted continuum emission in the line-of-sight. The MYTS component describes the reprocessed emission from the surrounding torus. The relative normalization ( S) of the MYTS component is estimated using a \u2018constant\u2019 in XSPEC. The MYTL component describes the Fe KU and Fe KV line emission. The relative normalization of this component (AL) is set to be the same as the relative normalization (AS) of the MYTS component.

Thus, we used the decoupled configuration of mytorus (MYTD), which mimics a clumpy torus. This can be achieved by decoupling the column density of the MYTS component from that of the MYTZ component. In this configuration, we set the inclination angle of MYTS and MYTL components to 0\u00b0 to mimic the backside reflection from the far side material. Thus, the column density represents the global averaged column density of the obscured material (# torH ). The inclination angle of the MYTZ component is instead set to 90\u00b0. MYTZ represents the direct component, and its column density is the line of sight column density (# losH ) (Yaqoob 2012).

We obtained similar variations of # losH from different spectral models (see Section 5.1).

Braito et al.

In our analysis, the angular dispersion of the torus is obtained as ftor \u223c 24\u25e6 \u2212 26\u00b0. One can easily estimate the torus covering factor ( tor) using Equation 2 (Yamada et al. 2020).

Our X-ray spectral analysis with the borus02 and RXTorus models returned tor \u223c 0.6 and \u223c 0.4.\nRicci et al.

On the other hand, for the Compton-thick material (#H > 10\n24 cm\u22122), the covering factor is predicted to be Ttor \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.3 (see also, Ricci et al. 2015). We obtained an Eddington ratio of _Edd \u223c 0.1 for \"BH \u223c 10\n7.65 \"\u2299 (Marinucci et al. 2012). Our estimated torus covering factor is tor \u223c 0.85 which is higher than the predicted value for _Edd \u223c 0.1. However, if we consider a higher mass, \"BH = 10\n8.4 \"\u2299 (Winter et al. 2009), the Eddington ratio is _Edd \u223c 10\n\u22122. For this Eddington ratio, the covering factor predicted by Ricci et al. (2017b) ( tor \u223c 0.85) is consistent with the results we obtained from the fit with the xclumpy model. This seems to suggest a higher mass of the SMBH. However, the study of Ricci et al. (2017b) was conducted using a large sample, that show a variation of covering factor and/or_Edd in a wide range. Hence, it will not be correct to prefer the higher mass for the SMBH solely from this. On the other hand, the covering factors for the Compton-thick\nmaterial is obtained to be Ttor \u223c 0.35\u22120.37, which is slightly higher than the value predicted by Ricci et al. (2017b).\nThe AGN absorber is complex and there may exist multiple absorbers along the line of sight. In a simpler scenario with two absorbers, one absorber can be considered as varying while the other absorber is non-varying. In IC 751, Ricci et al. (2016) were able to disentangle the column density of the varying clouds from the nonvarying absorbers. In NGC 4507, # losH changed about \u223c 15 \u2212 20% in \u223c 35 days timescale. This implies that \u223c 80 \u2212 85% # losH did not change and there may exist a non-varying absorber. We tried to disentangle the non-varying absorber from the varying one by adding an additional absorber during the spectral analysis. We allowed one absorber to vary and kept the other absorber tied across the observations. However, we were not able to disentangle two absorbers as we could not constraint the column density of two absorbers."

One can also estimate the radius of the mid-IR emitting region ('MIR; Tristram & Schartmann 2011):\nlog( 'MIR\n1pc ) = \u221221.62 + 0.5 log(!14\u2212195). (9)\nThe 70-months averaged luminosity of NGC 4507 is log(!14\u2212195) = 43.96 (Ricci et al. 2017a). Using this, we obtained,\n'NIR \u2243 0.08 pc \u2243 95 light-days, and 'MIR \u2243 2.32 pc \u2243 2760 lightdays.\nFrom the above calculations, we estimated that 'BLR \u223c 0.013 pc, 'NIR \u223c 0.08 pc and 'MIR \u223c 2.3 pc. The location of the reporecessed material is estimated to be 'C \u223c 0.01 \u2212 21 pc (for \"BH \u223c 10 8.4 \"\u2299) or 'C \u223c 0.002 \u2212 4 pc (for \"BH \u223c 10 7.65 \"\u2299). These results indicate that the material responsible for the #H variability could be associated either to the BLR or to the torus."

            "text": "NGC 4507 was extensively observed in the X-ray wavebands over the years. Figure 4 shows the evolution of the line of sight column density (# losH ). The blue points are taken from the literature. The red points in the inset figures are from the current work. Figure 5 shows the variation of (a) the 2 \u2212 10 keV observed flux, (b) the 2 \u2212 10 keV intrinsic luminosity and (c) photon index (\u0393) between 1990 and 2015. The blue points represent the observations taken between 1990 and 2015.\nThe line of sight column density was observed to vary in the range of \u223c (3 \u2212 10) \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 in the past years. In 1990, a Ginga observation revealed a Compton-thin nucleus with #H \u223c 5\u00d71023 cm\u22122 (Awaki et al. 1991). An ASCA observation, carried out in 1994, also showed a Compton-thin nucleus (#H \u223c 3\u00d710\n23 cm\u22122). Risaliti (2002) reported of a Compton-thin absorber (#H \u223c 5 \u2212 6 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122) by studying three BeppoSAX observations performed between 1997 and 1999. A column density of #H \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 23 cm\u22122 was found by XMM-Newton and Chandra observations in 2001 (Matt et al. 2004). Suzaku observed the source in 2007, finding a higher obscuration (#H \u223c 9\u00d710\n23 cm\u22122; Braito et al. 2013). XMMNewton and Chandra observation campaign in 2010 reported a variable #H in the range of\u223c 6.5\u22129.7\u00d710\n23 cm\u22122 (Marinucci et al. 2013).\nIn most of the previous studies, the X-ray spectral analysis was performed with a power-law or with the pexrav model. We also performed the spectral analysis using such a phenomenological model, and found that the column density varied in the range \u223c (6 \u2212 8) \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122. Braito et al. (2013) obtained a line-of-sight column density of # losH \u223c (6 \u2212 9) \u00d7 10\n23 cm\u22122, after applying the MYTD model to the XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and BeppoSAX observa-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (2021)\ntions performed between 1997 and 2007. They also estimated the # torH \u223c (2.4 \u2212 3.5) \u00d7 10\n23 cm\u22122. In the present work, we found that the global averaged column density of the obscuring material is # torH \u223c 2.2 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10\n23 cm\u22122 from the 2015 observations. From this, we can conclude that the global averaged column density of the absorber was nearly constant over decades, which is expected, as the global properties of the circumnuclear material are unlikely to change on the timescale of months. We tabulated the variation of # losH over the years in Table A6.\nIn the past 30 years, the source luminosity was observed to be in the range of !intr2\u221210 \u223c (1\u22124) \u00d710 43 erg s\u22121. In our analysis, we found that the source luminosity is in the range of !intr2\u221210 \u223c (3\u22123.6) \u00d710 43 erg s\u22121. This implies a rather steady accretion onto the SMBH at the centre of NGC 4507 . The rms fractional variability of < 3% in 35 days timescale also support the steady accretion. At similar luminosity, the rms variability is observed to be in the range of \u223c 0.1\u221210% (Fiore et al. 1998). The rms variability is, thus, consistent with other AGNs in similar timescale (Fiore et al. 1998)."

            "text": "We studied NGC 4507 using NuSTAR observations obtained between May 2015 and August 2015. Using the phenomenological slab model and several physically motivated torus-based models, we studied the properties of the X-ray emission and of the obscuring gas. We also estimated various properties of the obscuring material, e.g., the line-of-sight column density, the average density of the obscuring material, and its covering factor. From the variability of the absorption, we also provided some refined constraints on the location of the obscuring materials. Our key findings are given below.\n(i) We found that the equatorial column density of the torus is\nCompton-thick (#EqH \u223c 2 \u00d7 10 24 cm\u22122).\n(ii) During the period of the observations analyzed here, the line of sight column density (# losH ) was found to vary in the range of # losH \u223c 6 \u2212 9 \u00d7 10 23 cm\u22122. The variability of # losH is observed on timescales of \u2264 35 days. (iii) No variability is observed in the primary emission during the observation period. (iv) The source was found to be buried in the obscuring medium, with the torus having a high covering factor tor \u223c 0.83 \u2212 0.85. For the Compton-thick material, the torus covering factor was found to be Ttor \u223c 0.34\u22120.37 which is in good agreement with average covering factors of the obscuring materials for nearby AGN (e.g., Ricci et al. 2015).\n(v) The reprocessing material is found to be located either at the BLR or in the torus."
