However, studies are limited on how effectively transplant centers address psychological 17 care5. The Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy and The Joint Accreditation 18 Committee for IST and EBMT (FACT-JACIE) require dedicated psychological staff to assist 19 in pre-transplant recipient evaluation and treatment, and post-transplant care6. However, 20 guidelines are limited regarding the optimal structure of psychological services7,8. This national 21 survey explored UK transplant center (TC) psychological care practices. Our objectives were 22 to review psychological workforce and services, psychological screening, quality review 23 processes, participant perceptions on psychological care and current services, factors that 24 would improve services, and impact of center size on workforce and service ratings. The survey 25\nVariations in psychological care: a national survey 2\norganization that develops evidence-based guidelines for healthcare in England9. 28 29 This survey was designed in liaison with clinicians and clinical psychologists with experience 30 in HCT. It was electronically distributed to three participants at each UK adult TC (n=24) that 31 performs allogeneic and autologous HCT: physician, clinical nurse specialist (CNS) and 32 specialist psychological practitioner who reviews HCT patients. The survey comprised 10-32 33 questions varying in number for each professional role (for example, only psychological 34 practitioners answered questions on workforce and services), and seven common questions on 35 perceptions of psychological care. Questions were mostly closed with options for comments. 36 Three open questions explored barriers to psychological care provision and ways to improve 37 it. Definitions were provided to avoid ambiguity (see supplementary for questionnaire). 38 39 The survey was approved by the Clinical Trials Committee of the British Society for Blood 40 and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (BSBMTCT) (CTCS-1902). Participants 41 were recruited using purposive sampling. Psychological practitioners and CNSs were 42 identified via professional networks of practitioners known to have established roles in HCT. 43 Physicians identified were HCT programme directors. Invitations were distributed online via 44 the BSBMTCT. Participants were asked to identify a more suitable candidate to complete the 45 survey if they were not able to complete it themselves. Three reminders were sent to non-46 responders, 3-4 weeks apart. In three TCs where psychological practitioners were not 47 recruited, collateral information was obtained from HCT clinicians to determine where the 48 psychological practitioner was based, and work time dedicated to HCT or Hematology. In 49 one center, the lead psychologist was contacted to verify this information. The remaining two 50\nVariations in psychological care: a national survey 3\n53 The survey was piloted amongst nurses, physicians and clinical psychologists with experience 54 in HCT. The full survey was open from 30th October 2019 to 28th February 2020. 55 56 Data was collected in Excel version 16.45 and analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequencies 57 and medians). A content analysis of open text comments was performed. The Mann-Whitney 58 U statistical 2 tailed test was performed to determine center size effect on workforce capacity. 59 60 The TC response rate was 100% (24/24). Of 70 participants approached, 89% (n=62) 61 responded: 20 physicians, 21 CNSs and 21 psychological practitioners. 62 63 Results show that although psychological services are available in most centers, the time 64 available to HCT patients is highly variable. 33% TCs (n=8) have a hematology based 65 psychologist, with >0.5 work-time-equivalent dedicated to hemato-oncology including HCT. 66 Half these centers (n=4) have an HCT based psychologist. The remaining 67% TCs access a 67 psychological practitioner based outside hematology, with no dedicated time to HCT. TCs with 68 psychological practitioners based within hematology showed a trend towards being larger 69 centers with higher annual numbers of total transplants performed, although when compared 70 to remaining centers, a statistically significant difference in transplant numbers could not be 71 shown (p=0.05) (supplementary Fig.S1). Types of services provided to patients and staff are 72 also variable (fig.1). Only 52% (n=11) services use quality indicators to assess their service 73 (supplementary Fig.S2). 74 75\nVariations in psychological care: a national survey 4\nparticipants feel that pre-HCT psychosocial assessment could significantly improve the quality 78 of life of HCT recipients. 79 80 Regarding clinician practices, 76% of nurses and 30% of physicians rated themselves as 81 confident or very confident in identifying patients with psychological distress and referring 82 them appropriately. 83 84 Overall, physicians and nurses gave higher service quality ratings in centers where the 85 psychological practitioner is based within hematology: physicians\u2019 median ratings of 86 allogeneic services based within and outside hematology were 8/10 (n=7) and 3/10 (n=13) 87 respectively, where \u201c10\u201d is considered adequate to meet patients\u2019 needs (supplementary Table 88 S1). Similarly, psychological practitioners rated the availability of their services to HCT 89 recipients. This showed a trend towards higher ratings where services are more dedicated, 90 particularly pre-HCT (supplementary Table S2). 87% of all participants feel that the 91 psychological practitioner needs to be embedded within the HCT team to improve quality of 92 life and psychological outcomes (supplementary Fig.S4). 93 94 Apart from funding, the main factors identified to improve psychological care include: 95 Resources eg. staffing (n=32), HCT specific/trained psychologists (n=15), integrated medical 96 and psychological care (n=13) and better screening/assessment of patients (n=12) 97 (supplementary Table S3). 98 99\nThis is the first national survey of HCT psychological services within the UK. To our 100\nVariations in psychological care: a national survey 5\npsychological and medical practitioners, making findings highly representative of adult HCT 103 psychological care within the UK. It highlights considerations in meeting international quality 104 standards in HCT. There are some limitations. Firstly, as there is no pre-existing tool to 105 evaluate HCT psychological services, the survey tool is not validated. However, the tool aligns 106 with existing standards of care in HCT, and guidelines on cancer services. It was piloted 107 amongst HCT clinicians to ensure clarity and accuracy. Another limitation is that we use 108 subjective clinician ratings to assess effectiveness of services. We believe this is the best 109 measure given that standard service quality indicators are not widely used. Furthermore, our 110 findings aren\u2019t generalizable to pediatric HCT or to healthcare systems outside the UK. 111 Nevertheless, this study highlights the need for closer integration of medical and psychological 112 services to ensure equitable access to adequate care. In the US, the existence of mental health 113 services within TCs is influenced by center size and insurer coverage10. Access to available 114 services was not explored but two studies show that access to pre-HCT psychological 115 assessment in the US is limited11,12. Policies ensuring better integration of services may help 116 improve access. 117 118 In summary, the availability of psychological care to HCT recipients throughout the UK is 119 markedly varied, and many healthcare providers consider it insufficient to meet patients\u2019 needs. 120 The variation in participants\u2019 service ratings, favoring TCs with more dedicated care, reflects 121 inequity in quality of care or access to psychological support. Most healthcare providers concur 122 that dedicated psychological care in HCT is needed to improve outcomes. We recommend 123 clearer guidelines and quality standards on the components of psychological care provision in 124 HCT to enable equitable and effective psychological services. A similar study should be 125\nVariations in psychological care: a national survey 6\nperspectives on effectiveness of services. 128 Data Availability 129 The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, 130 RN, upon reasonable request. 131 132 References 133 1) Jenkins PL, Linington A, Whittaker JA.
