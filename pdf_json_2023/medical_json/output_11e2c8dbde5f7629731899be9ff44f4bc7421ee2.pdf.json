    "abstractText": "Mars lacks a global magnetic field, and instead possesses small-scale crustal magnetic fields, making its magnetic environment fundamentally different from intrinsic magnetospheres like those of Earth or Saturn. Here we report the discovery of magnetospheric ion drift patterns, typical of intrinsic magnetospheres, atMars usingmeasurements fromMars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioNmission. Specifically, we observewedge-like dispersion structures of hydrogen ions exhibiting butterfly-shaped distributions (pitch angle peaks at 22.5\u00b0\u221245\u00b0 and 135\u00b0\u2212157.5\u00b0) within the Martian crustal fields, a feature previously observed only in planetary-scale intrinsic magnetospheres. These dispersed structures are the results of drift motions that fundamentally resemble those observed in intrinsic magnetospheres. Our findings indicate that the Martian magnetosphere embodies an intermediate case where both the unmagnetized and magnetized ion behaviors could be observed because of the wide range of strengths and spatial scales of the crustal magnetic fields around Mars.",

Here we report the discovery of magnetospheric ion drift patterns, typical of intrinsic magnetospheres, atMars usingmeasurements fromMars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioNmission. Specifically, we observewedge-like dispersion structures of hydrogen ions exhibiting butterfly-shaped distributions (pitch angle peaks at 22.5\u00b0\u221245\u00b0 and 135\u00b0\u2212157.5\u00b0) within the Martian crustal fields, a feature previously observed only in planetary-scale intrinsic magnetospheres. These dispersed structures are the results of drift motions that fundamentally resemble those observed in intrinsic magnetospheres. Our findings indicate that the Martian magnetosphere embodies an intermediate case where both the unmagnetized and magnetized ion behaviors could be observed because of the wide range of strengths and spatial scales of the crustal magnetic fields around Mars.\nUnlike Earth or Saturn, which possess strong planetary-scale intrinsic magnetospheres, Mars offers a unique magnetic environment in the solar system due to the absence of a planetary-scale intrinsic magnetic field1,2 and the presence of localized crustal magnetic fields3,4. It is widely accepted that the Martian crustal fields have a significant impact on the solar wind interaction with Mars and potentially plays a key role in the planet\u2019s atmospheric evolution5,6. Numerous studies found that the crustal fields act as magnetic umbrella, shielding the ionosphere from erosion by the solar wind7\u201313. However, contrasting views have been put forth by other researchers, reporting that the crustal fields could locally enhance the escape rate of ions by facilitating energy transfer between the solar wind and the Martian ionosphere5,6,14. To comprehend the role of crustal fields in ion escape, wemust address the question, howdo the crustal fields control the ion behavior? Answering this question could advance our understanding of the solar wind interaction with Mars and the Martian atmospheric evolution15\u201317. The localized crustal fields are often called mini-magnetospheres because they exhibit morphological similarities to scaled-down intrinsic magnetospheres18\u201321.

Charged particles within planetary-scale intrinsic magnetospheres tend to become magnetized since they offer a large electromagnetic environment compared with the particle\u2019s gyroradius. In this case, the presence of electric fields and inhomogeneity of magnetic field induces particle\u2019s drift motion, consequently aiding the formation of drift dispersion structures of magnetized particles22\u201328. Drawing from Earth\u2019s magnetosphere as an illustrative example, the magnetic gradient and curvature drift velocity depend on the particles\u2019 energy, and give rise towestwardmotion. Electric drift, however, is independent of energy, resulting in motions to any directions depending on magnetic local times and L (L-shell) values. Consequently, distinct spatial distributions of particles at different energies are generated. For example, previous studies have demonstrated that the low-energy portion of injected ions can drift more eastward than the high-energy portion does on the dawnside because of the presence of the convection electric field. The discrepancy is significant at particular L22\u201327. As a result, when a spacecraft crosses radially into or out of the inner magnetosphere, it records wedge-like energy dispersion structures in energy versus time spectrograms of ions, characterized by an increase followed by a decrease in ion\u2019s energy along the spacecraft trajectory. Hence, these drift dispersion structures commonlymanifest as wedgelike energy dispersion patterns in particle\u2019s energy versus time spectrograms, which essentially represent distinct spatial distributions of particles at different energies.\nMoreover, it is crucial to recognize that the wedge-like dispersion structures of particles require a stable electromagnetic environment where the particle\u2019s motions are adiabatic22,26, otherwise, the chaotic motions of particles would lead to their rapid dissipation. The wedgelike dispersion structures of plasma, are commonly observed within the planetary-scale intrinsic magnetospheres with strong magnetic field strength, such as those of Earth22\u201327 and Saturn28. Hence, the wedge-like dispersion structures of plasma serve as indicators that the spatial scale of the electromagnetic environment is significantly larger than the plasma\u2019s gyroradius.\nRecent observations of drift dispersion structures of magnetized electrons within the Martian crustal fields have indicated that the crustal fields exhibit behavior akin to an intrinsic magnetosphere on the scale of the gyroradius of electrons20. Consequently, it is expected that the electron dynamics in the crustal fields are similar to those found within intrinsic magnetospheres. In contrast, ions having larger gyroradius are commonly thought to be unmagnetized within the localized Martian crustal fields29,30, which have weak magnetic field strength and large spatial-temporal inhomogeneity (in contrast to Earth or Saturn\u2019s intrinsic dipole fields). Thus, the prospect of observing the magnetized ion behaviors typical for intrinsic magnetospheres (e.g., wedge-like dispersion structures of ions) within the Martian crustal fields is less likely.\nHere we present the observations of wedge-like dispersion structures of ions within the Martian crustal fields, based on the highresolution magnetic fields and plasma measurements obtained by Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission (MAVEN)31. This finding suggests that the magnetized ion behavior commonly observed in intrinsic magnetospheres also occurs at Mars, enhancing our understanding of how the crustal fields control the ion dynamics."

The average location of MAVEN was (\u22120.62, 0.69, \u22120.74) RM(radius of Mars, RM = 3396 km) in Mars Solar Orbital (MSO) coordinates. Supplementary Fig. 1 provides a visual\nrepresentation of the MAVEN spacecraft\u2019s path. MAVEN was located above the region with the strongest crustal field, characterized by a longitude of approximately 180\u00b0, latitude of approximately 60\u00b0S, and an altitude of around 650km.\nAn interesting observational feature is that MAVEN detected a series of energy-time dispersed ion signatures (refer to Fig. 1a) with a period of approximately 20-30 seconds during the time interval of 22.52-22.58. MAVEN observed four consecutive rising-tone dispersed structures (energy increase with time), starting at 22.52.32, 22.53, 22.53.25, and 22.53.50 UT (identified by the black dashed curves), with later structures at clearly lower energy than the preceding ones. Later, four falling-tone dispersed structures characterized by energy monotonically decreasewith time starting at 22.55.24, 22.55.34, 22.55.48, and 22.56.04 UT were detected. The presence of both rising and falling tones indicates that MAVEN captured spatial dispersion structures of ions rather than a purely temporal effect, which would only produce falling tones14,30. These observed features closely resemble the wedgelike dispersion structures commonly observed in Earth\u2019s magnetosphere22\u201327 and in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere28.\nThe energy range of the dispersed ions extends up to approximately 200eV and down to the lower energy limit of the SolarWind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) instrument32, at 25 eV. Figures 1b, c show the energy spectrum of light ions (m/q<8) and heavy ions (m/q> 12) based on the Suprathermal and Thermal Ion Composition (STATIC) data33, where it is evident that the energy-dispersed signatures are dependent on themass of the ions. Specifically, the light hot ions with energies ranging from 20eV to 200eV exhibit clear energy dispersion signatures, whereas the heavy ions have relatively low energies (E < 50 eV) and do not show dispersed signatures. The mass-energy spectrum in Fig. 2 indicates that the dispersed ions are primarily hydrogen ions (H+) with m/q= 1, and possibly a small fraction of H+2 or He\n2+ with m/q=2. The dominance of H+ applies to all dispersion structures, indicating that these different dispersions are not due to the difference in the mass, which sometimes happens on the Earth34. While it is challenging to ascertain how much H+2 or He\n2+ contributes to the dispersions, here we assume that the dispersed ions are entirely H+ . Figure 2 also indicates that heavy ions of Marian origin (O+ and O2\n+) do not contribute to the dispersion (the energy ismuch lower than dispersion structures). Therefore, we suggest that the observed dispersedH+ was likely originated from the solar wind rather than Mars since their energy distribution is distinctly different to that of heavy ions.\nThe presence of electron voids, characterized by the decrease in suprathermal electron flux (as depicted in Fig. 1d) detected by Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA)35, combined with the good agreement between the magnetic fields observed by the Magnetometer (MAG)36 and the latest spherical harmonic model of the crustal fields37 (as shown in Fig. 1e), strongly suggests that MAVEN entered a region dominated by crustal fields. However, there are slight differences between the observed magnetic fields and the model fields37, which may be attributed to the influence of induced fields. Upon scrutinizing it further, it appears that the observed fields can be approximated as a linear superposition of the crustal fields and steady Bx-dominated fields (as depicted in Fig. 1f), represented by Bobs =Bmodel + 14:8, 0:93, 4:15\u00bd nT, where Bobs,Bmodel correspond to the observed magnetic fields and crustal fields model, respectively. The presence of double-sided loss cone distributions of electrons and the magnetic topology analysis38 (as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2) further indicates that the field lines primarily consisted of closed crustal field lines with both foot-points located in the nightside ionosphere (MAVEN traversed from about 5 to 3 local time in the early morning sector). Basedon these features,we can infer that the observedwedgelike dispersed H+ ions occurred within the mini-magnetosphere formed by the closed field lines of the crustal fields, albeit with additional [14.8, \u22120.93, \u22124.15] nTmagnetic fields caused by the influence of induced fields.

It is evident that the dispersed H+ ions across all energy ranges exhibit butterfly-shaped pitch angle distributions39, characterized by pitch angle peaks at 22.5\u201345\u00b0 and 135\u2013157.5\u00b0. Upon scrutiny, a notable asymmetry in the butterfly-shaped distribution dictated by the polarity of the radial component of the magnetic fields (Br, refer to Fig. 3e), becomes apparent. Prior to 22.56.09 during which Br is negative (as indicated by the blue vertical dashed line in Fig. 3), the flux of H+ ions with a pitch angle of 22.5\u201345\u00b0 (ions moved toward the planet) is higher than that of ions with a pitch angle of 135\u2013157.5\u00b0 (ions moved away the planet). Conversely, after 22.56.09 during which Br is positive, there is a higher flux of H+ ions with a pitch angle of 135\u2013157.5\u00b0. These results indicate that there are more inward-moving H+ ions compared to outwardmoving ones. The majority of ions with pitch angles of 22.5\u201345\u00b0 and 135\u2013157.5\u00b0 fall within the field-of-view of SWIA (see Supplementary Fig. 3), thereby reinforcing the reliability of the aforementioned results."

The first involves magnetic reconnection, where solar wind might enter into the crustal fields along open field lines. This scenario seems improbable asmagnetic topology analysis reveals no evidence of open field lines (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Yet, we could draw an analogy to the formation of the low-latitude boundary layer observed at Earth40. Specifically, the magnetic reconnection taking place at the cusps on both sides could have led to closed field lines and facilitated the injection of solar wind into the crustal fields.\nMoreover, the non-adiabatic effect (such as the finite gyroradius effect) represents a second mechanism that could enable the solar wind ions to inject into the crustal fields29. Given the constraints of limited observations, it is challenging to demonstrate any of these scenarios."

However, our observations reveal that the dispersed structures occur simultaneously in both parallel and antiparallel moving directions (see Supplementary Fig. 4), which contradicts the aforementioned scenario.\nThe periodic appearance may also originate from upstream plasma waves14,42. The upstream waves excited by planetary pickup ions or ions reflected by the bow shock would exhibit a period approximately equal to the proton cyclotron period (on the order of 10 s)42,43, in alignment with the periodicity of the observed dispersed structures.

            "text": "Two potential mechanisms can account for the symmetric butterfly distributions observed in the Earth\u2019s innermagnetosphere44. In thefirst mechanism, ions with a pitch angle near 90\u00b0 or 0\u00b0/180\u00b0 may not be efficiently trapped and are consequently lost, leading to a butterfly distribution of the remaining trapped particles39. The loss of ions with pitch angles near 0\u00b0/180\u00b0 could be attributed to the loss cone effect, while the loss of ions with pitch angles near 90\u00b0 could be attributed to the magnetopause shadowing due to their large gyroradius or drift shell splitting effect due to their drift trajectory39. The second possible mechanism is wave-particle interaction45. There are no local waves observed (as indicated in Supplementary Fig. 5), but it is possible that heating takes place at low altitudes, and as the heated ions move up into regions with weaker magnetic fields the distributions fold up and form conics due to the mirror force, which could show up as butterfly distributions46\u201348. However, given that the wedge-like distributions appear to be of solar wind origin, we propose that the observed butterfly distributions are primarily caused by the first mechanism, wherein the trapped ions exhibit pitch angles of 22.5\u201345\u00b0 or 135\u2013157.5\u00b0 at the spacecraft\u2019s position, while ions with other pitch angles are lost.\nNonetheless, it has difficulty in explaining the asymmetry between 22.5\u201345\u00b0 and 135\u2013157.5\u00b0 pitch angles since the loss cone mechanism predicts nearly symmetric distribution between 22.5\u201345\u00b0 and 135\u2013157.5\u00b0 pitch angles. Thus, the ion velocity distributions at the source might already be anisotropic (lack either parallel or perpendicular ions) when these solar wind H+ accessed the crustal fields, leading to the observations of more inward-moving ions.\nFormation mechanisms of the wedge-like dispersion structures The wedge-like dispersion structure observed in intrinsic magnetospheres is attributed to the radially spatial separation of ions at different energies22\u201327. To gain a comprehensive understanding of our specific case atMars, it is essential to investigate the spatial separation of ions at different energies within the crustal fields. A useful approach is to examine the drift path of particles and the spacecraft trajectory relative to the crustal fields on the magnetic equator plane22\u201327. This plane is defined by the magnetic equator points, which correspond to the locations of the minimum field strength (Bt) along the field lines. For the Earth\u2019s dipole field, the magnetic equator plane is basically parallel to the equator plane and can be easily determined, and we can utilize the L-value parameter to quantitatively ascertain the positions of the magnetic field lines. The magnetic equator points situated in lower L-shells possess higher Bt .\nHere we also construct a magnetic equator plane of the crustal fields to determine the spacecraft\u2019s relative path and gain insights into the spatial distribution of ions at different energies. First, we extracted the magnetic equator points of the traced field lines (denoted by the magenta dots in Fig. 4a). Subsequently, we employed the least-square method to fit the average magnetic equator plane (depicted by the grey-shaded region) that encompasses most of these magnetic equator points. Figure 4a demonstrates that thesemagnetic equator points predominantly reside within the magnetic equator plane, indicating that this plane is well-determined. Then, similar to the dipole field, we set a local coordinate system to study the distribution of ions at different energies, where n is the normal direction of the magnetic equator plane, a is the azimuthal direction, r is the radial direction (pointing to the outer region of crustal fields) which completes the right-handed system (see detailed information in the Methods).\nThe distribution of Bt of the magnetic equator points in the magnetic equator plane is depicted in Fig. 4b. It is evident that the Bt increases as the relative radial distance decreases, indicating that\nmagnetic equator points with higher Bt correspond to field lines located in the more interior region of the crustal fields, similar to the dipole field pattern. Therefore, although we cannot employ the conventional L-value parameter for quantitative determination of magnetic field lines positions as done on Earth, we can qualitatively assess the relative radial positions of the field lines of crustal fields by comparing the Bt of their magnetic equator points. The magnetic equator points of the field lines situated in the more interior region of the crustal fields will have a higher Bt .\nWe also extracted the magnetic equator points of the field lines crossed byMAVEN during this period (marked by blue dots in Fig. 4a), and obtained their Bt value (refer to Fig. 4c). We can find that the Bt of these magnetic equator points initiates at approximately 25 nT, then increases and reaches its maximum value of around 45 nT at 22.54.45, and subsequently gradually decreases to about 33 nT. These variations indicate that MAVEN was progressively entering the interior region of the crustal fields during 22.52.30-22.54.45 (see the blue arrow in Fig. 4b), resulting in an inward movement of about 150 km. Consequently, the estimated radial inward speed of MAVEN within the magnetic equator plane is approximately 1.1 km/s. Subsequently, MAVEN moved towards to the outer part of crustal fields during 22.54.45-22.57.30.\nImportantly, each individual dispersed structure (refer to Fig. 4d) reveals a clear trend, as MAVENmoved toward to the inner (outer) part of crustal fields, the energy of the ions increased (decrease). This suggests that the high-energy portion of each individual dispersed structure primarily resides in the inner part of the crustal fields, while low-energy portion tends to occupy the outer part. For instance, for the first rising tone, MAVEN observed a notable increase in ion energy from about 20 eV at 22.52.30 to about 200eV at 22.53.10. This increase is accompanied by a corresponding rise in the Bt values of the magnetic equator points, which went from approximately 25 nT to 35 nT. This suggests that the 200eV ions were located approximately 100 km deeper inside the crustal fields compared to the 20eV ions on the magnetic equator plane (refer to Fig. 4b). Consequently, we infer that, in a single injection scenario, the injected ions drifted toward the center of the crustal fields, with higher energy ions penetrating deeper into the crustal fields.\nAccording to the above results, the complete scenario of observed wedge-like dispersions could be obtained (refer to Fig. 5). Let\u2019s start with the case of only one injection (refer to the younger injection represented by violet color in Fig. 5). All injected ions exhibited a drift motion towards the center of the crustal fields. The 200 eV ions (dark violet) could drift deeper into the inner region compared to the 20eV ions (light violet), leading to the observation of one rising tone (falling tone) when MAVEN moved towards the inner (outer) part of the crustal fields.\nThe two injections would yield the observations of two rising and falling tones. As depicted in Fig. 5, the red color represents the older injection event that occurred 10-30 s earlier than the younger injection (violet color). Thus, the ions from the older injection experience 10- 30 s longer drifting time than that of the younger injection, allowing them to penetrate deeper into the crustal fields compared to the ions from the younger injection. Consequently, the spacecraft could only detect the dispersed ions with energy ranging from 20 to 100 eV for the older injection since the ions with energy higher than 100 eV of the older injection had penetrated deeper than the spacecraft. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the older (younger) injection exhibited a lower (higher) observed peak energy and occupied a more interior (outer) region of the crustal fields, characterized by a higher (lower) Bt of magnetic equator points. With the knowledge gained from the two injections, we can readily extrapolate the results for four injections. The rising and falling tones observed in the outermost (innermost) region of the crustal fields correspond to the youngest (oldest) injection, which possesses the highest (lowest) observed peak energy. These findings align well with the observations presented in Fig. 4b\u2013d.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6866 5\nAnother question is why the high-energy ions could drift deeper into the crustal fields. The total drift velocity of particles (VD) can be written as,\nVD =VMag:Drift +VEle:Drift\n=Wsin2 \u03b8\u00f0 \u00de=qBt3B\u00d7\u2207Bt +2Wcos2 \u03b8\u00f0 \u00de=qBt4B\u00d7 B \u2207\u00f0 \u00deB\u00bd +E \u00d7B=Bt2 \u00f01\u00de\nwhere W ,q represents the energy, charge of ions, respectively. B,E,Bt is the local magnetic fields, electric fields, and magnetic field strength, respectively. \u03b8 denotes the pitch angle of the particles. VMag:Drift represents the magnetic drift velocity, which consists of the gradient drift and the curvature drift, represented by the first and second term on the right-hand-side of Eq. (1). VEle:Drift, the last term on the right-hand-side of Eq. (1), is the electric field drift velocity. In the case of Earth\u2019s inner magnetosphere with a dipole field pattern, the radial motion of ions is solely influenced by the electric field drift velocity since the magnetic drift velocity occurs exclusively along the azimuthal direction. Thus, the electric field drift motion plays a vital role in\na\nMagnetic equator plane\nMAVEN\nFig. 4 | Spatial separation of ions with different energies and the relative path ofMAVEN on themagnetic equator plane of crustal fields. a The distribution of magnetic equator points (magenta dots) of traced field lines (grey curves). Based on these magnetic equator points, we fit the magnetic equator plane (grey shaded region) that these magnetic equator points are almost located via the least-square method. The magnetic equator points of traced field lines along spacecraft\u2019s trajectory (blue curve) are marked by blue dots.

It should be noted that these magnetic equator points were not perfectly aligned with themagnetic equator plane, resulting in the magnetic drift velocity not being strictly orthogonal to \u2207Bt . The azimuthal and radial distance are the relative distance between each point to the origin point (the innermost magnetic equator point which is marked by the white star in the top left corner). c Time series of the Bt ofmagnetic equator points of the tracedmagneticfield lines crossedbyMAVEN. d The ion spectrum.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6866 6\nforming the wedge-like dispersion structures, despite being independent of ion energy22\u201327.\nIn our specific case, it is evident that themagnetic drift velocity on the magnetic equator plane of crustal fields is also primarily along the azimuthal direction and does not contribute to the radial transport of ions (as illustrated by the black arrows in Fig. 4b). This indicates that the radial transport of ions into the center of the crustal fields might also be facilitated by the electric field drift motion, akin to scenarios observed on Earth.Moreover, if wedisregard the electricfield drift, the total drift velocity of high-energy ions should be higher than the lowenergy ions since VMag:Drift is proportional to the ion\u2019s energy. Consequently, the observed rising tone structures indicate that MAVEN initially overtook the low-energy ions, followed by the high-energy ions. However, themagnetic drift speed of 50-200 eV ions ranges from 7-30 km/s, significantly exceeding the spacecraft\u2019s speed (about 3.8 km/s). This contradicts the aforementioned scenario and implies the involvementof the electricfielddrift. Nevertheless, further analysis remains constrained due to the limited information available on electric fields.\nHere we employ the similar scenario forming the dispersed ions observed on Earth to elucidate our findings at Mars22 (refer to Fig. 6). We establish an electric field drift velocity (VEle:Drift) that nearly balances the magnetic drift velocity (VMag:Drift) in azimuthal direction, with a limited radially inward component (refer to the white arrow in Fig. 6). Thus, the resulting total drift velocity (VD) exhibits an inward tendency as the energy increases, since VMag:Drift is proportional to the ion\u2019s energy. Consequently, the 200 eV ions exhibit a greater propensity to drift deeper into the inner region compared to the 20 eV ions. Then MAVEN would record one rising tone (falling tone) when moving towards the inner (outer) part of the crustal fields. In this scenario, the VEle:Drift should nearly counterbalance the VMag:Drift in the azimuthal direction. Taking into\nconsideration that the |VMag:Drift| of 20-200 eV ions varies from 3-30 km/s and the average magnetic field strength is about 35 nT, the magnitude of electric field (E= VEle:DriftB) contributing the azimuthal component of VEle:Drift should be on the order of 0.1 mV/m. Furthermore, the observed rising tone structures indicate that, asMAVEN entered into the interior region of crustal fields, MAVEN should be faster than the dispersed ions along the radial direction (see Fig. 6). In other words, MAVEN\u2019s radial speed (about 1.1 km/s) should surpass themagnitude ofVEle:Drift along the radially inward direction. Consequently, the magnitude of the electric field (E= VEle:DriftB) that contributes to the radial component of VEle:Drift should be lower than 0.05mV/m. Thus, the total magnitude of electric fields should be on the order of 0.1 mV/m, consistent with the latest simulation of the convective electric fields at Mars (0.1- 1 mV/m)49. This value significantly exceeds the corotation electric field (0.01 mV/m) at this altitude (around 600 km), indicating that the potential existence of convective or impulsive electric fields.\nThese dispersed ions are anticipated to undergo adiabaticmotion within the crustal fields. The gyroradius of 200 eV H+ (representing the upper limit energy of dispersed ions) with a pitch angle of 90\u00b0 spans a range of roughly 30 km to 100 km (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Meanwhile, the curvature radius of the field lines ranges from around 300 km to 1000 km (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Consequently, the adiabatic parameter (\u03ba), defined as the square root of the ratio between the value ofmagneticfield curvature radius and the particle\u2019s gyroradius50, consistently exceeds 2 (Supplementary Fig. 6c). This suggests that the dispersed ions predominantly undergo adiabatic motion, which aligns with our expectations.\nIn addition to the event discussed above, we have identified 16 additional wedge-like dispersion events within the crustal fields from the MAVEN dataset, spanning over a period of 5 years (refer to\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6866 7\nSupplementary Table 1). The rare occurrence of drift dispersion structures might imply that their formation relies not only on the configuration of local magnetic fields, but also on the setup of electric fields that exhibit high variability atMars. These observations highlight that both electrons and ions can become magnetized at Mars. Furthermore, for the ions, the Martian magnetosphere exhibits an intermediate case wherein both unmagnetized and magnetized ion behaviors are observable because of the wide range of strengths and spatial scales of crustal magnetic fields."

The crustal fields were derived from the latest spherical harmonic model of the crustal magnetic field37.\nWe divide the spatial region within the latitude range of \u221265\u00b0 to \u221255\u00b0 and the longitude range of 175\u00b0 to 190\u00b0 into a grid with a spacing of 1\u00b0 for both longitude and latitude. The altitude is then set at 500 km, resulting in 150 initial points, which are represented by r0, then the next position could be obtained by r1 = r0 +b \u03b4l, where b is the unit magnetic field vector at r0, and \u03b4l is the step length, here we set \u03b4l = 1km.Applying the sameprocedures,we could know the ith point of the field lines, ri i= 1,2,3::\u00f0 \u00de. We stop the tracing when the altitude reaches 200 km since the crustal fieldmodel could only well represent the crustalfields at altitudes above 120 km.

Then all the data points in this plane should satisfy the equation, A Px +B Py +C Pz +D=0, where P=Pxx+Pyy+Pzz represents the positions of data points, D is constant. In other words, the data points on the plane would satisfy that, P n+D =0.
