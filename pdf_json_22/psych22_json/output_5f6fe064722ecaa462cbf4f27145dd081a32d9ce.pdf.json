Methods Data from 6,296 adults in the 2019 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were included. The suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicidal behavior of diabetes patients were compared to the general population. After classifying the patients into \u22641 year, 2 to 9 years, and \u226510 years of diabetes duration, we evaluated the relationship between the duration of diabetes and the suicide risk. Results Diabetes patients had higher prevalences of suicidal ideation (9.1%, p<0.001) and suicide plans (3.6%, p<0.001) than the general population. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, suicide plans (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.926, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.325\u20136.463) were significantly associated with diabetes. In the 2 to 9 years group of diabetes patients, we found an increase in the risk of suicidal ideation (aOR=2.035, 95% CI=1.129\u20133.670), suicide plans (aOR=3.507, 95% CI=1.538\u20137.996), and suicidal behavior (aOR=7.130, 95% CI=2.035\u201324.978) after adjusting for the covariates. However, no increases in suicide risk were observed \u22641 year and \u226510 years after diabetes diagnosis. Conclusion In adults, diabetes is associated with an increase in suicide risk. Suicide risk in diabetes patients showed an inverted U-shaped depending upon the duration of diabetes.

            "text": "In this study, we examined the relationship between diabetes and suicide risk in adults through a nationwide survey conducted in South Korea in 2019. Of the diabetes patients, 9.1% experienced suicidal ideation in the past year, which was more than twice that of the control group without diabetes. And, the prevalence of having a suicide plan in the past year was 3.6%, which was more than three times that of the control group. In the case of suicidal behavior prevalence, statistical differences were not identified between the diabetes patient group and the control group; however, it was difficult to find statistical significance due to the small number of people that experienced suicidal behavior. Our finding of an increase in the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide plans in diabetes patients was consistent with those in previous studies. According to Tabb et al.,18 the prevalence of suicidal ideation in patients with type 2 diabetes ranged from 2.5% to 51.4%.\n*adjusted for sex, age, depressive disorder diagnosis, marital state, employment status, family income, education, smoking status, risky drinking, regular exercise, major cancer diagnosis and number of chronic diseases. OR, odds ratios; DM, diabetes mellitus; CI, confidence interval\n330 Psychiatry Investig 2022;19(4):326-332\nSignificant increases in risk were observed in suicidal ideation (OR=2.285, 95% CI=1.555\u20133.360) and suicide plans (OR=3.496, 95% CI=1.939\u20136.304) before adjustment. And when covariates that differed between the diabetes patients and the general population were adjusted, a statistically significant increase in risk was confirmed only for suicide plans (aOR=2.926, 95% CI=1.325\u20136.463). After adjustment, suicidal ideation (aOR=1.493, 95% CI=0.904\u20132.465) no longer showed a statistically significant increase in risk. These results differed from previous studies in which the risk of suicidal ideation was increased in diabetes patients.19 Several reasons can be considered for the lack of increase in the risk of suicidal ideation in diabetes patients after adjustment. First, the small number of people who experienced suicidal ideation may have widened the range of the CI. This is likely to be confirmed statistically as the KNHANES VIII data are accumulated in the future. Second, most of the previous studies focused only on suicidal ideation without distinguishing between suicidal ideation and suicide plans. This methodological difference may have been the cause of the results differences between this study and previous studies. Third, the risk of suicidal ideation decreased significantly after adjustment (OR=2.285 \u2192 aOR= 1.493). This suggests that the sociodemographic factors used for adjustment may be associated with the suicidal ideation of diabetes patients. Indeed, there was a significant sociodemographic difference between the diabetes group and the general population in our study. Diabetes patients were more likely to be alone (divorced/separated/widowed), unemployed, and have lower household incomes. Diabetes patients also had higher rates of depressive disorder, major cancer, and chronic disease diagnosis compared to the general population. All of these factors were conditions shown to increase suicide risk in previous studies.20-24 And it may have increased the risk of suicidal ideation and suicide plans in diabetes patients before the adjustment in our study as well.\nThe adjusted risk of suicide plans in diabetes patients (aOR= 2.926, 95% CI=1.325\u20136.463) was three times higher than that of the general population in our study. This relationship between diabetes and suicide can be interpreted through several previous studies. Diabetes is a chronic disease that causes great psychological difficulties, and diabetes patients have a high rate of experiencing psychological difficulties such as depression and anxiety.25-27 In particular, depression is one of the main causes of the increasing suicide risk,28 and diabetes patients may experience more depression which could increase suicide risk than that of the general population. Several studies have been conducted on the relationship between diabetes and depression. First, consider the common factors associated with the onset of diabetes and depression. Diabetes and depression are commonly associated with activation of the hy-\npothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis). Chronic stress observed in depressed patients activates the HPA axis, which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and promotes the secretion of noradrenaline from the adrenal medulla.29 This hormone secretion and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system can cause insulin resistance, promoting type 2 diabetes.29 Therefore, the possibility that diabetes and depression share a common cause can be considered. Second, insulin resistance observed in diabetes can lead to depression.30 Several studies have suggested that insulin resistance can cause depression in diabetes patients by changes in brain glucose metabolism and neuroinflammation.31,32 A cohort study conducted in 2021 observed an increased incidence of major depressive disorders in people with insulin resistance.33 These factors may have induced depressive symptoms in diabetes patients, which may have increased the risk of suicide.\nWhen examining suicide risk according to the duration of diabetes classified as \u22641 year, 2 to 9 years, and \u226510 years, only the 2 to 9 years group showed statistically significant increases in the ORs in all three categories of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicidal behavior. However, an increase in suicide risk was not be observed in the \u22641 year and \u226510 year postdiabetes diagnosis groups. The suicide risk had an inverted U-shape depending upon the duration of diabetes. These results may be due to residual confounding factors, but could also reflect the true association between diabetes duration and suicide risk. Most likely, patients with diabetes mellitus for \u22641 year would have their blood sugar controlled with a small amount of oral antidiabetic medication and a lower incidence of major diabetic complications. In these conditions, although patients might experience adaptation problems, it would not increase the suicide risk. However, in the case of patients with diabetes mellitus for 2 to 9 years, as diabetes progresses, the dose and complexity of antidiabetic medications may gradually increase, including the use of insulin injections. Patients in this phase may also suffer psychological stress due to the failure of blood sugar control or lifestyle changes needed to manage diabetes. According to a previous study on the occurrence of complications in diabetes patients in South Korea in 2020, years 2 to 9 were the period when most diabetes complications occurred.34 These factors could impose a great psychological burden on diabetes patients and contribute to the increase in suicide risk in the group with diabetes mellitus between 2 to 9 years. More than 10 years after a diabetes diagnosis, patients may gradually adapt to diabetes management, which explains why no increase in suicide risk was observed in the patients in this period.\nOur study had several strengths. There have only been a few studies on the relationship between the duration of diabetes and suicide risk. In 2014, a study investigated the relation-\nwww.psychiatryinvestigation.org 331\nship between suicidal ideation and diabetes regimens, diabetes duration, and HbA1c levels. The risk of suicidal ideation was found to increase as the duration of diabetes increased. However, in that study, the duration of diabetes was classified only as <5 years and \u22655 years.35 By applying different classifications to subdivide the duration of diabetes, we were able to use additional factors to interpret how diabetes and suicide were related in a time-dependent way.\nFurthermore, most other studies that dealt with the relationship between the duration of diabetes and psychological difficulties only looked at the relationship between the duration of diabetes and depression, not suicide. According to Almeida et al.,17 the relationship between diabetes duration and depression had a J-shape in 2016. In that study, when the duration of diabetes was less than 10 years, the degree of depression experienced by patients was relatively high, but like when the duration of diabetes was 10 to 20 years, the degree of depression was somewhat decreased.17 In a study on the relationship between chronic diseases and depression in 2017, patients with diabetes, the only chronic disease studied, did not show an increase in depression immediately after their diagnosis, but the depressive symptoms gradually increased over time.36 These results may also be related to our results, in that, a significant increase in suicide risk was not observed in the groups with a duration of diabetes of \u22641 year and \u226510 years, but the suicide risk increased in the group with a disease duration of 2 to 9 years.\nThis study had several limitations. First, as this study is a cross-sectional study, it is difficult to confirm the causal relationship between diabetes and suicide risk. Since previous studies reported a bidirectional relationship between diabetes and depression,10 additional research is needed to confirm the causal relationship between diabetes and suicide risk. Second, we could not measure the psychological burden of diabetes patients, such as depression and anxiety, which may have an association with suicide risk. Third, this study could not consider the severity of diabetes and the status of diabetes treatment. The more severe the diabetes is, the more diabetes complications will occur in patients, which could cause greater psychological stress in diabetes patients. Fourth, although this study adjusted for several confounding factors between diabetes patients and controls, there may still be confounding factors that have not been considered. In particular, the treatment status and the medication effects of comorbid diseases could be confounding factors that we did not consider, and these factors might have influenced our results. Fifth, the questionnaire used in this study asked the respondents to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicidal behavior. Therefore, the degree of suicide risk could not be measured.\nDespite these limitations, we were able to obtain new results on the changes in suicide risk according to the duration of diabetes through a nationwide survey in this study. These results have not been reported previously and further studies are needed. In addition, medical staff should be aware of the suicide risk observed in diabetes patients when treating diabetes patients to offer appropriate interventions."
