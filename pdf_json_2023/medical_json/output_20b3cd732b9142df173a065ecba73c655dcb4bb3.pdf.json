While young adulthood is a critical period for adopting and stabilizing lifelong healthy behavior, university life is independently associated with psychological stressors that may further affect health and well-being.\nObjective: The present multidisciplinary study aimed to examine the health behavior of Austrian college and university students, differentiated based on diet types (vegan, vegetarian, and omnivorous) and physical activity (PA) habits.\nMethods: Following a cross-sectional study design, a total number of 6,148 students (65.3% females; 66.1% bachelor students, 67.0% from urban areas; mean age: 24.8 years) from 52 Austrian college/universities participated in an online survey and provided data on sociodemographic characteristics, dietary patterns, PA habits, and other lifestyle behavior characteristics, including alcohol intake and smoking.\nResults: Across the total sample, 74.0% had a normal weight (BMI = 18.5\u201325.0 kg/ m2), while the prevalence of overweight/obesity (BMI \u2265 30.0 kg/m2) was lower in females than males and more in rural than urban students (p < 0.01). The general prevalence of vegetarian and vegan diets was 22.8 and 6.0%, respectively, with a predominance of females, graduates, and urban students compared to their peers (p < 0.01). The majority of students (79.3%) had a regular engagement in sport/ exercise, with a predominance of vegetarian or vegan students compared to omnivores (p < 0.01). Vegans and vegetarians had a lower alcohol intake (p < 0.01) but no differences in smoking habits (p > 0.05) compared to omnivores. Students engaging in sport/exercise had a lower smoking rate and higher intake of fruits, vegetables, and fluids compared to inactive students (p < 0.01)."

            "text": "Health is an essential component of any individual\u2019s life. In fact, having good health allows a person to properly develop personally and socially, as well as to interact with others and effectively respond to external stimuli (1, 2). According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (3) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Voluntary Global Targets on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (4), health is among the major topics for human development and satisfaction. Sustainable health refers to the achievement of optimal health outcomes for individuals while also considering the public health impacts, specifically on the environment, society, and future generations (3, 5). Therefore, there is an overarching responsibility for health to include major contributions at all societal levels (6), which implies the urgency of health-oriented action competence and sustainable willingness to act (7). Despite the advancement of health knowledge, recent trends worldwide show a high prevalence of chronic health conditions, particularly NCDs (8\u201310), which were the cause of 74% of deaths worldwide (9).\nEvidence indicates that health behavior plays a fundamental role in preventing and managing most chronic diseases, including obesity, cardiometabolic disorders (e.g., dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension), and psychosocial problems (e.g., discrimination, social isolation, low self-esteem) (11\u201314). Although imperative at any stage of the life cycle, one\u2019s health condition assumes an even higher value in specific periods of life in which an individual faces several changes that may affect behavior (15). One such period is, for instance, moving to a higher educational level (from primary to secondary education, from secondary to college, etc.) since, in many cases, this also implies changes in the social circle of peers, more complex school assignments, and even environmental changes (i.e., moving to new school facilities) (15). Among the behavioral variables that could offer a better insight into one\u2019s health condition and make a balance between personal health and environmental/social sustainability, experts point out the importance of diet, physical activity (PA), and harmful habits such as tobacco or alcohol abuse (16).\nHealthy diet plays a key role in sustainable lifestyle (17). One of the most appropriate dietary strategies to achieve sustainable lifelong health is adhering to a plant-based diet (18\u201320), commonly categorized as a vegetarian or vegan diet (21, 22). Global epidemiological data show that the prevalence of both vegan and vegetarian diets is increasing worldwide (23\u201325). It has been indicated that at least 10% of European adults adhere to a vegan or vegetarian diet (25, 26), and younger adults are more likely to follow plant-based diets than older adults (27\u201329). The health benefits of vegan and vegetarian diets, especially in the management of several chronic\ndiseases, have also been noted by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (30) and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (21). Evidence shows that compared to an omnivorous diet, plantbased diets may also lead to a healthier body mass index (BMI) (22, 31, 32) and a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (33\u201335). Regardless of diet type, however, assuring adequate consumption of healthy food options (e.g., fruits, vegetables, fluids, whole grains) are considered the basis of a healthy diet (36\u201339). To maximize health benefits, it has been suggested that a healthy diet should be\u00a0complimentary to regular engagement in PA (40\u201343). To date, however, limited studies have investigated the associations between diet type, PA habits, and other health behaviors, particularly in educational settings (44, 45).\nRegarding PA, several parameters are considered important indicators of an active lifestyle. One of the most commonly used indicators is the recommended amount of weekly PA (e.g., whether this is achieved or not) (46). In fact, according to several healthfocused international entities, young adults should comply with at least 150 min of PA per week distributed over at least 3 days (47). According to the WHO (46, 47), this quantity is the minimum necessary for PA to benefit an individual\u2019s health. Indeed, carrying out PA at or beyond the recommended time seems to be\u00a0associated with several positive health effects (48, 49). Likewise, it is suggested that not achieving the minimum recommendation of PA may affect several health parameters, including worsening mental health (50). In addition, the type of PA carried out seems to be\u00a0of relative importance. For instance, individuals may choose to be\u00a0active in an unstructured way, unrelated to organized sport clubs or specific associations, or they can adhere and become members of entities and clubs offering structured sports/sporting activities. Unstructured PA has been associated with a high potential of positively affecting people\u2019s health in different ways, including increased enjoyment and motivation to be\u00a0 active (51). The relationship between PA and health is highly significant regarding positive human development (52).\nIn addition to PA and diet, other lifestyle factors, such as the abuse of tobacco and alcohol, have been studied for decades in the field of behavioral sciences and health (53). Substance abuse may be\u00a0considered of particular importance in young adults, taking into account the parallel social changes happening at this point in life (53). Tobacco abuse has been previously associated with several indicators of health, such as reduced attention and memory when combined with cannabis (54). Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mentions that smoking may increase the risk of cancer, cardiovascular and lung diseases, diabetes, and other non-communicable illnesses (55). Regarding alcohol abuse, according to the WHO, it may cause more than 200 diseases and injuries (56).\nFrontiers in Public Health 03 frontiersin.org\nThese outcomes are further confirmed in a study conducted by Lee and Lee (57), which found that males and females who binge drink had higher odds of experiencing depressive moods and suicidal intentions.\nA critical life period is during the transfer from adolescence to adulthood, as not only purely biological changes occur but also psychological and social changes (58, 59). Research shows that health behavior and the associated consequences shape and develop at young ages and continue over the lifespan (60, 61), significantly impacting lifelong health and well-being (62). Educational settings (e.g., schools, colleges, universities) are of utmost importance in shaping and developing life-long health behavior (63, 64). In particular, the literature highly emphasizes the importance of monitoring and applying effective strategies to improve the health behavior of university students at the critical stage of young adulthood (65\u201367). Hence, health-related research at this stage and the observation of student health-related behavior can provide practitioners with invaluable information about preserving and improving their health status. Due to the sedentary nature of the academic routine, university students tend to exhibit a higher prevalence of sedentary behavior compared to the global average (68), with approximately 50% failing to meet the minimum recommended level of PA (69\u201371). They have also been found to be\u00a0at a high risk of having an unbalanced diet (66). These findings, however, contradict the increasing trend of young adults adopting vegetarian and vegan diets (27\u201329), which emphasizes the need to evaluate their health behaviors respecting diet type differences.\nMonitoring the current health-related habits of college/university students is the initial step towards planning and implementing practices that can help promote and maintain healthy conditions during such a decisive life period. Therefore, the aim of this study to investigate lifestyle behavior based on dietary subgroups (omnivorous, vegetarian, vegan) and analyze potential associations with PA patterns as well as sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, BMI, and living environment) among Austrian college/university students. The conceptual framework of this study revolves around examining how university students\u2019 lifestyle behaviors are impacted by their diet types, PA patterns, and sociodemographic characteristics. By analyzing these interactions, the study provides valuable insights into the complex nature of lifestyle behaviors and their potential underlying determinants among young adults."

The survey was developed based on both the previous school study as its extension (72) as well as a comprehensive review of relevant literature, including validated questionnaires, large-scale scientific studies/reports, and recognized literature from renowned scientists, all of which are available in the study protocol (73). Participants were asked to respond to single-choice items, multiplechoice items, and choose and weigh their preferences among several options, which should be\u00a0 considered during data analysis and interpretation. However, considering the scope of the project (73), the present manuscript/study covers a general overview of the data, focusing on prevalences based on diet type and PA habits of participants.\nIn particular, the survey collected data on socio-demography (age, sex, nationality, federal state, living environment, marital status, highest academic level), anthropometry (height and body weight), study status (study level, subject area, current semester, university type), PA behavior (sports/exercise type, duration, frequency, participation in competitions, leisure-time activities, sports club membership, etc.), nutrition (current adherence to kind of diet, type and frequency of fluid intake, frequency of fruit and vegetable intake),\nFrontiers in Public Health 04 frontiersin.org\nand other lifestyle factors (amount and frequency of alcohol intake and smoking). Several control questions were included in the online questionnaire to identify contradictory information to increase the reliability of the data sets.\nBMI was calculated using self-reported height and body weight (BW) values. Based on the WHO cut-points (74\u201376), participants were assigned to four BMI subgroups including underweight (\u2264 18.5 kg/m2), normal-weight (18.5\u201325.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0\u201330.0 kg/m2), and obese (\u2265 30.0 kg/m2). Based on the self-reported diet types, participants were classified as vegetarian (those who do not eat meat, meat products, fish, and shellfish but consume dairy, eggs, and honey), vegan (no intake of any foods or ingredients from animal sources), or omnivorous diet (no dietary restriction on food sources) subgroups (30). For each type of sport/exercise engagement (i.e., leisure-time and sports club), participants were also categorized into those who engage in sport/exercise and those who do not. With regard to the frequency of sport/exercise (irrespective of the type of engagement), participants were assigned to three categories: \u201c0\u20131 day/week,\u201d \u201c2\u20134 days/week,\u201d and \u201c5\u20137 days/week.\u201d More detailed methodological information regarding the measuring tools and components can be\u00a0find in the study protocol (73) as well as on the projects\u2019 website (See footnote 1)."

The importance of this period is not limited to age-related characteristics (being in emerging adulthood); university life is independently associated with psychological stressors that undesirably affect health and future life (77). Data from a previous study demonstrated that 60% of university students do not meet the minimum PA recommendations and 47% have an unbalanced diet\n(66). Compared to these findings, college/university students in the present study had generally healthier behaviors with regard to sport/ exercise engagement and dietary habits. In addition, the low prevalence of obesity and overweight in our sample (18.6%) corroborates the existing evidence from the WHO European Regional Obesity Report 2022, in which the Austrian population present among the lowest rates of combined obesity and overweight in Europe, and also globally (78). Moreover, this is in line with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report on the health status in the Austrian population, with about 17% of adults allocated in the category of overweight/obesity (79). Considering the strong relationship between physical inactivity and obesity rates (80), our data seem to be\u00a0confirmed by both the existing evidence regarding adults\u2019 PA levels and the data collected in the present research. Particularly, our study points out that more than 3 of every 4 college students are physically active, regardless of the type of sport/exercise chosen (unstructured or as a part of a membership in sports clubs). While it should be\u00a0noted that the PA assessment method used in the present study does not provide a clear determination of the percentage of participants who met the minimum PA recommendations, the present findings seem to be\u00a0consistent with the results from another study reporting that Austrian adults are among the most physically active in Europe, with three-quarters of them meeting the PA recommendations (79). Similarly, a total of around 75% of Austrian adults are reported to achieve the recommended weekly PA, according to data retrieved by the WHO (81). Indeed, higher PA leads to a more active metabolism and greater energy expenditure, which in turn increases the ability of the body to lose body weight or maintain it within healthy ranges (82). Previous studies have additionally tested different types of exercise (modality, intensity), finding that all of them have a positive effect on obesity and overweight, although with moderate differences from each other (83). Although the present cross-sectional study is unable to provide information on the effects of leisure-time sport/exercise and club sports on body weight, data show that the prevalence of excess body weight was lower in physically active students (especially those with leisure-time sport/exercise engagement) compared to non-active students. Health organizations, such as the CDC, confirmed that PA has a direct effect on weight loss as well as several indirect consequences, such as improved blood pressure, increased metabolism, or better cardiovascular health (84).\nA deeper analysis of our findings also shows that most of the sport/exercise carried out by the participants of our study is provided by leisure-time, unstructured sport/exercise (79.3%) rather than membership in sports clubs (19.3%). While current guidelines do not clearly specify whether leisure-time sport/exercise or sports club activities may have a higher priority for health outcomes (46, 47), evidence indicates that both types can significantly promote overall health and well-being (85, 86). However, each of these types of PA may have advantages and disadvantages towards active behavior maintenance. For instance, both may be\u00a0affected by time availability, as reported by Koh et\u00a0al. (87). Time management may significantly change when attending college/university due to a new studying schedule (as classes may be\u00a0distributed throughout the day, whereas they tend to be\u00a0concentrated in shorter intervals and typically in the morning at lower education levels) as well as several changes in the social environment and general lifestyle (15). Furthermore, both types of PA may be\u00a0influenced by environmental characteristics, such as the availability of sports facilities (88) or landscape features\nTABLE\u00a05 Diet type by sex, study level, living environment, and nationality presented as number of participants (n) and prevalence (%).\nOmnivorous n (%) Vegetarian n (%) Vegan n (%)\nTotal sample 3,641 (71.2) 1,164 (22.8) 309 (6.0)\nMale 1,410 (82.1) 244 (14.2) 64 (3.7)\nFemale 2,218 (66.0) 907 (27.0) 235 (7.0)\nDiverse 13 (36.1) 13 (36.1) 10 (27.8)\nStudy level\nBachelor Students 2,261 (72.6) 672 (21.6) 180 (5.8)\nGraduate Students 1,380 (69.0) 492 (24.6) 129 (6.4)\nLiving environment\nUrban 2,353 (68.4) 839 (24.4) 249 (7.2)\nRural 1,288 (77.0) 325 (19.4) 60 (3.6)\nNationality\nAustria 2,985 (71.9) 935 (22.5) 234 (5.6)\nOther 656 (68.3) 229 (23.9) 75 (7.8)\nTABLE\u00a06 Anthropometric characteristics by diet type presented as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), as well as absolute (n) and relative (%) numbers of participants (N) and prevalence (%) for BMI categories.\nOmnivorous Vegetarian Vegan\nAge (years)1,2 25.3 \u00b1 6.9 24.0 \u00b1 4.8 23.8 \u00b1 4.0\nHeight (cm)1,2 172.7 \u00b1 9.4 170.0 \u00b1 8.4 169.4 \u00b1 8.4\nBody weight (kg)1,2 68.6 \u00b1 14.6 63.2 \u00b1 11.6 62.2 \u00b1 10.0\nBMI (kg/m2)1,2 22.9 \u00b1 3.9 21.8 \u00b1 3.2 21.6 \u00b1 2.8\nUnderweight (%)1 229 (6.3) 116 (10.0) 32 (10.4)\nNormal weight (%)1,2 2,631 (72.3) 924 (79.4) 250 (80.9)\nOverweight (%)1,2 606 (16.6) 97 (8.3) 21 (6.8)\nObese (%)1,2 175 (4.8) 27 (2.3) 6 (1.9)\n1Significant difference between omnivorous diet and vegetarian diet (p < 0.01). 2Significant difference between omnivorous diet and vegan diet (p < 0.01).\nFrontiers in Public Health 09 frontiersin.org\n(mountain, beach, etc.) (89). Again, several college and university students often have to relocate to attend the new school, which may cause rearrangements and changes in their previous sport/exercise schedules to fit the new environment. Nonetheless, a major point separating leisure-time sport and exercise carried out in sports clubs may be\u00a0that the latter requires the payment of a membership fee and, consequently, is affected by the individual\u2019s financial availability. Previous studies have highlighted that willingness to pay for a membership depends, among other factors, on personal income (90, 91). Since college and university students usually leave their legal guardian household and become independent, they also need to autonomously sustain their life expenses, potentially driving them towards free-of-cost solutions for their daily PA. The positive effect of PA on weight control seems to be\u00a0higher when combined with a proper diet (92), and the present data appears to confirm this statement. As mentioned above, nutritional behavior was also found to be\u00a0positive in our sample, especially in those students who are also sufficiently active. On the one side, previous data suggest that increased PA may have a positive influence on individual choice of healthier nutritional habits (93). On the other side, combining a healthy diet and sufficient PA produces higher odds of improved health conditions than PA or nutrition alone (94). In particular, Elliot and Hamin found that nutrition and PA together provided 17.5 times\nhigher chances of losing weight than PA alone (5.2 times) or diet only (7.2 times) in the observed sample (94).\nIn the present study, the prevalence of vegetarian/vegan diets were 28.8%, with a higher rate in females, graduates, and urban students compared to male, bachelor, and rural students, respectively. The higher prevalence of plant-based diets in the present study may be\u00a0partially justified by the reports indicating younger adults are more interested in following plant-based diets (27\u201329) or the greater prevalence in German-speaking countries compared to the European average (29, 95, 96). Vegan and vegetarian diets seem to have the larger relationship with engagement in leisure-time sport/exercise in our sample. This finding is in line with previous reports indicating vegetarians and vegans may have healthier lifestyle habits, including a higher involvement in PA, sport, and exercise (44, 97). While the higher health-consciousness of individuals who follow a vegetarian/ vegan diet compared to omnivores (98\u2013100) may partially justify their higher engagement in sport/exercise, it should be\u00a0considered that plant-based diets tend to be\u00a0higher in complex carbohydrates, which provide sustained energy throughout the day (19, 30), and thus, may help them feel more energized and motivated to engage in sport/ exercise. Although more research is required to explain the differences in behavioral patterns based on diet type, it is well known that vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns are equally adequate for providing individuals with all the essential nutrients beneficial for a healthy development (101) but also have a high protective effect against several diseases (21, 30), including cancer and diabetes. Therefore, along with sufficient PA, plant-based diets might provide extra benefits for individual and public health (102). Compared to omnivores, the rate of sport/exercise engagement in vegetarian and vegan students of the present study was 5.8 and 9.7% higher; however, students following an omnivorous diet also had a very high participation in leisure-time sport/exercise (82.9%). Regardless of personal preferences in diet type, the proper supply of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and the consequential nutrient intake should be\u00a0ensured in order to maximize the positive combined effect of diet and PA towards better weight management and, more generally, health status (36, 103).\nResults from the present study show that the prevalence of alcohol intake in vegan and vegetarian students is lower than in omnivores,\nTABLE\u00a07 Health related behavior by sports participation presented as prevalence (%).\nLeisure-time sports Club sports Sport days/week\nyes no yes no 0\u20131 Days 2\u20134 Days 5\u20137 Days\nDaily fruit intake1,2,3 61.2 35.0 61.6 56.0 39.0 58.0 71.9\nDaily vegetable intake1,3 83.3 64.0 81.4 80.1 67.8 82.6 86.6\nFluid intake (> 2 L/ day)1,2,3 43.3 28.7 49.0 38.9 28.9 39.6 56.0\nWater as most common drink1,3 84.5 76.4 84.1 83.1 78.2 84.3 85.3\nAlcohol intake3 72.6 68.2 74.0 71.4 70.4 74.9 66.4\nSmoking1,2,3 10.8 18.0 8.6 12.8 16.4 11.9 8.0\n1Significant difference between sports participation during leisure time (p < 0.01). 2Significant difference between club sports participation (p < 0.01). 3Significant difference between sport days/week (p < 0.01).\nTABLE\u00a08 Health related behavior by kind of diet as prevalence (%).\nOmnivorous Vegetarian Vegan\nLeisure-time sports participation1,2 82.9 88.7 92.6\nClub sports\nparticipation\n22.1 22.7 20.1\nFluid intake > 2 L/day 41.1 40.0 46.2\nWater as most common drink1 82.0 86.2 86.7\nAlcohol intake1,2 73.3 69.3 67.5\nSmoking 12.3 10.5 11.7\n1Significant difference between omnivorous diet and vegetarian diet (p < 0.01). 2Significant difference between omnivorous diet and vegan diet (p < 0.01).\nFrontiers in Public Health 10 frontiersin.org\nwhich is consistent with the previous findings (44, 104). While diet type had no association with the prevalence of smoking, it has also been found that smoking is less prevalent among physically active students compared to those with no regular sport/exercise. One possible justification may lie in the fact that physically active students may use sport/exercise as a way to relieve stress and tension rather than smoking since PA has been shown to release endorphins (known as natural mood-boosting chemicals) and can help reduce anxiety and stress (105). It has been well-documented that substance abuse is disadvantageous for the academic performance of university students (106, 107). However, a high prevalence of smoking and alcohol intake (40\u201370%) has been reported in college and university students (108\u2013 110), especially among male students (108, 111)."

            "text": "Considering the cross-sectional design of the study in which the data were generated based on self-reports, there is a probability of socially desired statements, including underreporting (e.g., for body weight) and/or over-reporting (e.g., for PA habits). However, to maximize the reliability and validity of the data, several control questions were implemented in different parts of the survey with the purpose of identifying conflicting statements and minimizing the likelihood of misreporting. Accordingly, conflicting data were removed or revised from the associated analyses within the data clearance process. There might be\u00a0confounding factors (including all direct and indirect lifestyle-related parameters), which may potentially affect the findings and the associated interpretations. We\u00a0were also unable to validate the questionnaire since most variables in the survey were based on a single-item construct, which may originate from some pre-limitations such as lower precision in representing the related attribute, the low number of discrimination points, and the impossibility to assess internal consistency (112). However, it has been documented that single-item questionnaires may be\u00a0considered valid (113), can be\u00a0reliably used in the social sciences (114, 115), and may significantly reduce the limitations associated with lengthy surveys (116). Furthermore, it should be\u00a0acknowledged that the method of PA assessment used in the study may not have accurately measured the prevalence of students who met PA recommendations. Therefore, caution should be\u00a0considered when interpreting the findings related to the prevalence of meeting PA guidelines. Despite the existence of the abovementioned limitations, the present study has some strengths. This project has a multidisciplinary nature, including sport science, nutrition sciences, psychology, social sciences, and medicine. In addition, since current scientific evidence on the differentiated research questions is lacking on students in the tertiary educational setting, the present study is among the first to investigate the dual approach to sustainable health focusing on diet type and the associated epidemiological and sociodemographic aspects with a large sample."

Particularly, efforts towards enhancing the understanding of the interaction between diet type and lifestyle behavior during the\nearly stages of adulthood is crucial for the promotion of public health. Therefore, the present findings provide a sound basis for reflecting on current health and lifestyle behavior (particularly the dual approach of sustainable health), which will ultimately help to reflect and update the current health-related recommendations. This study can also make a significant contribution to the development of an overview of the social trends in health behavior, especially in the respective populations in tertiary educational settings. Findings are expected to help empower college and university policies to design future offerings that consistently present healthy and sustainable choices of foods and meals across the environments (e.g., vending machines, canteen) accompanied by opportunities for PA, sport, and exercise. Alongside this, serious considerations should be\u00a0 applied in health-related educational policies to enhance health literacy and consequently improve the level of public health and well-being."

            "text": "Despite the favorable health findings (concerning, e.g., BMI, prevalence of plant-based diets, regular engagement in sport/exercise), Austrian young adults had unsatisfactory health behavior regarding alcohol intake as well as fruit & vegetable consumption. Differentiated findings showed that vegan and vegetarian students and those with regular sport/exercise engagement show a slight tendency towards a healthier lifestyle. It can also be\u00a0concluded that diet type and PA habits of college/university students have an impact on other health behaviors, highlighting the interconnected nature of lifestyle habits and health behavior. These data emphasize the necessity of continuing efforts to implement and facilitate healthy lifestyle choices for young Austrian populations. The present findings can be\u00a0used by health specialists, decision-makers, and multipliers in health and education, and also may be\u00a0considered a starting point for future interventions to improve individual and public health. However, the constant monitoring of health behavior should be\u00a0 a priority in health investigations to find and understand the longitudinal trajectories of health behavior, which have a lifelong and sustainable nature. Future research should be\u00a0conducted to provide comparable data for a deeper understanding of the role of diet type and PA patterns on health behavior, health status, and physical performance of different healthy and unhealthy populations in sequential time points of life."
