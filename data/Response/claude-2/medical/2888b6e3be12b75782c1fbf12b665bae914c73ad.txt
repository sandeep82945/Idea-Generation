 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Test the efficacy of a cocktail or combination vaccine using the most promising recombinant proteins (rBsHP2, rBsGAL, and rBsUP) to see if protection can be further improved. 

2. Investigate the longevity of the immune response induced by the recombinant vaccines over an extended period of time.

3. Evaluate the recombinant vaccines in the natural giant panda host to confirm efficacy against B. schroederi infection.

4. Explore whether the recombinant vaccines can also provide protection against other related ascarid nematodes. 

5. Analyze the specific immune mechanisms induced by the recombinant vaccines through more detailed immunological studies of cellular responses, antibody functionality, cytokine profiles, etc.
