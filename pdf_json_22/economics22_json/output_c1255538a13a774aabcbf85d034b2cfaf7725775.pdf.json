    "abstractText": "Background: Several measures are in force in Switzerland to control the cost of drugs, but are not effective enough. There are many determinants influencing these expenditures, related to treatments, markets, physicians, patients and regions, but their impact on costs is not clear. Methods: We applied a Bayesian multilevel model with five levels to adjust for patients, drugs\u2019 market, and physicians \u2018characteristics, treatment type, and district (i.e. Swiss canton). We used data of the Swiss drugs\u2019 market in 2006, offer\u2010 ing real choices for doctors and patients (multiple products for similar active substances), with a neutral position of pharmacists (no financial incentives). Results: Variance partitioning of yearly drugs\u2019 cost per insured showed that market level (delivered substance) con\u2010 tributed to 76% of the variance, treatment level (delivered product) to 20%, whereas patients\u2019 and physicians\u2019 levels accounted for only 2% each, without significant differences between Swiss cantons. After adjusting for covariables at each level, the model explained about 51% of the variation at the market and 20% at the treatment levels. We found that older but substitutable drugs, generics, larger size of the market and physician\u2019s specialty were associated with lower expenditure, whereas drugs requiring a physician\u2019s prescription, the number of prescribers per patient, patient\u2019 age, male gender, and comorbidities increased expenditure. Our results show that for a specific medication the yearly cost of recently released drugs was 36 CHF higher than for similar and substitutable drugs introduced 15 years earlier, corresponding to one third of the average annual treatment cost observed in our dataset. Competition did not seem to be effective to reduce expenditure on the drug market. Conclusion: The main finding of this study is that recentness of drugs was associated with an increase in drug expenditure in 2006, even after adjustment for all non\u2010controllable determinants. Further research is recommended to confirm those results with updated data.",

            "text": "In 2018, drugs were sold for CHF 9.5 billion (public prices) in Switzerland [1], which represented 11.8% of total health costs (CHF 80.2 billion) and CHF 1,108 per inhabitant. In terms of ex-factory prices, the annual turnover of drugs rose from CHF 3.3 to CHF 5.0 billion between 2006 to 2018 [2], corresponding to an increase in ex-factory cost of drugs per capita of 33.5%, while the inflation was 2.5% during the same period [3] (Table\u00a01). A part of this increase was related to a growth in the number of prescribed packaging per capita (+ 7.4%), but a higher part was due to the ex-factory price increases (+ 24.3%). This price driven contribution to drugs expenditure was also observed in other countries [4].\nSeveral measures to curb drug expenditures are in force in Switzerland since 2001. First, patients have to pay the full cost until they reach a certain deductible,\n*Correspondence: yves.eggli@unisante.ch\nCenter for Primary Care and Public Health (Unisant\u00e9) \u2013 University of Lausanne, Route de la Corniche 10, 1010 Lausanne, Switzerland\nset by contract with their health insurer [5]. When they reach their deductible, patients still have to pay a 10% share up to a certain ceiling. Second, pharmacists receive an administrative tax for delivering drugs to reduce the perverse incentive of a remuneration proportional to the net sales [6]. Third, pharmacists are allowed to substitute medical prescriptions for the cheapest products if there are generic drugs [7]. Fourth, the prices of drugs are set administratively by the Confederation (Federal Office of Public Health, FOPH) on the basis of legal criteria (i.e. economics, efficiency, adequacy of the prescriptions according to scientific criteria), after a notice from the Swiss Medicines Commission [8].\nThe effectiveness of these measures was however criticized [9], and given the strong and continuing rise in the drug expenditure in Switzerland, politicians are willing to understand determinants of this rise in order to design appropriate measures that would limit it.\nIn 2017, the Swiss Federal Council commissioned a panel of expert to tackle the issue of costs increase in compulsory health insurance [10]. Among the 37 measures proposed in their report, four might help reducing drug expenditure. In August 2019, the Federal Council proposed to the Swiss Parliament to implement a first set of nine measures, including one related to drug pricing. Such a measure is applied in Europe [11], and consists in introducing a reference price for three kinds of drugs: generic drugs (i.e. same active substance as the original drug available when the patent has expired), \"me-too\" (i.e. different active substances with the same mechanism of action as the original drug), and some patent-protected drugs that are not very innovative. For drugs whose price is higher than the reference price, the delta would be at the expense of the patient. However, the motion currently (2022) discussed by the Swiss Parliament is limited to generics. In order to determine whether imposing a reference price to other substances (i.e. me-too and patent-protected drugs) is necessary, one might be willing to look at the impact of the age of drugs (i.e. the time since they have been introduced on\nthe Swiss reimbursement list) on their prices. Indeed, if products introduced recently, by stimulating competition, reduces drug prices, extending reference prices to other substances (\u201cme-too\u201d) is not necessary. On the opposite, it might be wise to recommend this extension if medicinal products introduced recently tends to increase expenditure.\nFrom a theoretical economic point of view, the first assertion should be observed in a perfect competition market [12]. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that the drug market is imperfect [13]. It is thus important to analyze empirically the determinants of drug retail expenditure, which we did in this study. Our objective was to analyze the possible impact of several variables on different levels: market (number of treated patients, competition for instance), physician (specialist or not), patients (age, gender, deductible, co-morbidities), regions (cantons), and the treatments (generics for instance), with, for every level, a special attention paid to the recentness of drugs (i.e. minus the age of drugs).\nA recent literature review has shown a significant effect of the expiry date of patents, the access to the generic market, and it emphasized the importance of tendering [14]. However, this review paper also indicates that scientific knowledge on the determinants of drugs expenses is lacking, largely related to a lack of transparency on this particular market. What is more, in Switzerland it is difficult to obtain representative drug data from insurers because such data could reveal the risk structure of insured and harm their risk financial compensation interests. Our study is based on 2006 data that four major insurance companies accepted to provide, anonymously, thanks to the support of the Federal Office of Public Health [15]. Although these data are arguably old, they provide a valuable and very rare source to understand the functioning of the Swiss drugs\u2019 market, while presenting some important advantages: they are highly representative of the Swiss population and they describe a drug market offering a significant choice among multiple products (18 per\nTable 1 Increase of drugs\u2019 costs from 2006 to 2018\na Ex-factory prices\nIndicators 2018 2006 Difference Growth\nNumber of delivered packages (millions) 126.4 103.1 23.3 22.6% Annual turnovera (Swiss francs, millions) 5 034 3 303 1 731 52.4% Average cost per packagea (Swiss francs) 39.8 32.0 7.8 24.3%\nPopulation (millions) 8.545 7.484 1.061 14.2%\nPer capita number of delivered packages 14.79 13.78 1.02 7.4% Per capita cost of drugsa (Swiss francs) 589.1 441.4 147.8 33.5%\nspecific market in average) at a time when the generics were significantly gaining importance."

Those data were already used to study the determinants of new drugs prescription in Switzerland [15], where it was shown that they were remarkably representative of the demographic structure of the population. In 2006, pharmacists already had a more neutral role in the choice of products, because they did no longer receive a percentage of the selling price but an administrative tax. Moreover, this year was a relatively stable year for regulated prices, whereas generics represented a growing share of the drug market (i.e. 47.4% of the potential marketed drugs with no more patent protection at that time, measured in number of outpatients drugs\u2019 packages) [16]. The setting was a random sample of 100,000 insured living in the nine cantons prohibiting doctors\u2019 drugs delivery (Aarau, Basel-Stadt, Fribourg, Geneva, Jura, Neuch\u00e2tel, Ticino, Valais and Vaud). We made this choice to ensure the exhaustiveness of drugs\u2019 deliveries, because pharmacists sent systematically drugs\u2019 claims to insurers but not physicians. Bills provided detailed information on active substances (medicinal product) and marketed package (i.e. its brand name, producer, formulation, pharmaceutical form, dosage, and quantity of doses). All data were anonymous, without variables enabling a potential identification of patients or physicians (no birth date or residence data for instance)."

To illustrate the significance of this variance partitioning, based on the empirical Bayes estimates of the random effects, we computed at each level of the hierarchy the contrasts between the percentiles P99 and P1, and P75 and P25, in terms of mean treatment-cost difference. For this, we used the back-transformation to compute the predictions on the original scale.\nThen, various conditional models were estimated and the proportion of variation (PEV) explained at each level computed to quantify the contribution of patients\u2019, physicians\u2019, market\u2019s, and treatment\u2019s characteristics to\nyijklm = \u00b5+ \u03b4 id j + \u03b4 phys k + \u03b4 atc5 l + \u03b5ijklm\ncontrast(x) = E(cost |X=x1)\u2212 E(cost |X=x0)\nthe outcome variance [25]. However, we did not compute the individual variable PEVs as, unless the regressors are all orthogonal, the variable-specific PEVs do not add up to the total level PEV [26]. Instead, to assess the importance of each independent variable we computed the contrast (i.e. the predicted difference in mean outcome values) between two different covariate-patterns. To keep interpretations simple, we contrasted covariatepatterns, which differed by only one variable taking a different value in each pattern (e.g. mean treatment-cost difference between patients in the older and younger age classes or the mean treatment-cost difference between a generic and a non-generic, etc.). Note that the regression coefficients are interpreted as semi-elasticities and, therefore, allow us to compute the percentage change in the outcome value for a unit-change in the regressor value. On the other hand, the back-transformation approach makes it possible to calculate the mean difference of the cost of the treatment in absolute value.\nThe contrasts were computed by considering all the available independent variables at each level, except at the market-level, where in addition to the two baseline variables (i.e. number of patients and market recentness), only one of the four additional variables (i.e. Herfindhal index, number of mee-too, number of drugs available, number of brands available) was included at a time, as these variables were entangled (and including all of them simultaneously in a model would provide meaningless coefficients). Therefore, we estimated four different regression models, in turn, to compute the impact of these four additional variables. Estimated coefficients of the other variables were quite similar in the four models. In the Result Section, we decided to report those from the model with HHI, since this variable was of particular interest to see whether competition plays its role in the drug market.\nAt the market level, we adjusted for confounding by cluster by including into each regression model the computed cluster means for the following variables: age of patient, gender, deductible, co-morbidity index, generic, and Rx drug [27, 28].\nProper convergence of the MCMC algorithm was assessed by inspecting the trace plots, smoothed histograms of the posterior distributions, and auto-correlation functions of the parameters. The goodness of fit of the model was assessed by inspecting histograms of the random effects and residuals, as well as scatter plots of residuals versus predicted mean cost of the treatments.\nAll the analyses were carried out using Stata 15.1 (StataCorp LP, 4905 Lakeway Drive, College Station, TX 77,845, USA) and MLwiN 2.36 (Centre for Multilevel Modelling, University of Bristol)."

Notice that to compute these contrasts, it is necessary, first, to define a reference covariate-pattern, as the back-transformation is non-linear, and contrasts depend on the covariate values. This reference covariate-pattern was built using the mean of each continuous regressor and the category with the most occurrence for categorical regressors. Notice that the contrasts were computed within levels but not across levels to provide interpretable results.\nAt the treatment level, the largest contrast resulted from the number of prescribers per treatment, + 217 CHF for treatments prescribed by 2 vs 1 prescriber. The prescription of similar but older drugs (drugs\u2019 substitution) allows one to reduce expenditure by -36.2 CHF for drugs of average age 15\u00a0years older. The annual cost of Rx drugs was 92.4 CHF higher than that of over-the-counter drugs, while generic drugs were 58.6 CHF cheaper than non-generic ones.\nAt the market level, drugs prescribed on larger markets were cheaper on average (i.e. -108 CHF for markets with 100,000 insured vs 10,000). The contrast between a market with new drugs vs a market with average drug age 15 was 104.8 CHF, showing that on younger markets drugs are more expensive than older ones (notice that these markets may not be substitutable as they are selling different drugs).\nAt the physician level, prescriptions from specialists were cheaper than GPs\u2019 (-54 CHF). This result might seem counterintuitive since specialists are expected to prescribe more costly drugs. In fact, they do prescribe more expensive molecules but adjusting for the prescribed molecules as we did in our model (via the market adjustment) turns out to reverse this trend.\nAt the patient level, drugs prescribed to people with 10 illnesses vs 1 were 19 CHF more expensive, and drugs prescribed to old people (85\u00a0years old or more) were 88.8 CHF more expensive than drugs prescribed to children and teenagers.\nAll remaining variables with a significant coefficient (i.e. male, deductible, and canton) had a low impact on drug expenditure."

            "text": "patient, physician, market, and canton. Then, we included explanatory variables at each level and determined the contribution of these variables to explain the variance measured at each level. To assess the impact of each statistically significant variable on drug expenditure on an intuitive scale, we computed contrasts.\nWe found that more than two third of the drug expenditure variance was determined at the market level, and the variable having the greatest impact on drug expenditure at this level was market size (average expenditure decreased by 108 CHF in market with 10,000 vs 100,000 insured). Notice, unfortunately, that market size is not controllable per se as it depends mainly on the number of people with a specific illness and may not be used as tool to control drug expenditure. Notwithstanding this, Swiss drug authorities might still strive to negotiate lower prices with their providers together with other countries. Regarding market recentness, we found a sharp contrast between markets with new drugs and markets with older drugs (there was a difference of 104.8 CHF when the average age of drugs differed by 15\u00a0years). However, this contrast describes markets selling different drugs which may not be substitutable. Nevertheless, some markets may be substitutable and fostering the selling of old drugs proven to be efficacious may be one way to reduce expenditure. Of the four variables (HHI, number of meetoo, number of drugs, and number of brands) used in turn in different models to measure competition on the drug market none turned out to be significantly associated with expenditure. This is somewhat unexpected given economic theory claiming that in a free-market competition will lower prices.\nThe treatment level also had a significant influence on drug expenditure (about 20% of the expenditure variability was explained at this level). The number of prescribers had the largest impact (drugs prescribed by two physicians were 217 CHF more expensive than those prescribed by one single physician). This should not be over interpreted, however, as in practice most insured had (on average) between 1.0 to 1.1 prescribers and the effect of this variable would thus be much weaker. This effect might be explained by different mechanisms. First, we might assume that having multiple prescribers is a proxy for drugs for chronic conditions, which naturally require lengthy and more costly treatments. In this case, unfortunately, prohibiting consulting several physicians would not produce any economies. Alternatively, it also possible that patients solicit other physicians to lengthen the prescription duration that was refused by the first physician (e.g. sleeping pills); gatekeeping mechanisms might be effective to reduce costs in such cases. We found that the use of generics (-58.6 CHF) and older drugs (-36.2 CHF) were associated with lower\nexpenditure. Generics are known to be cheaper than originals and incentives to use generics might contribute to cost reduction.\nWe found that older, substitutable, drugs were cheaper than newly released treatments, raising the question of the added value of drugs\u2019 recentness. Between 2012 and 2014, 68.9% of 270 newly registered medications corresponded indeed to already known active substances [29]. This shows that most of the newly released medications consisted essentially in a modification of the presentation of the drugs (administration mode, dosage, number of pills, co-marketing of same substance) or in \u201cme-too\u201d drugs without great differences in efficacy. One option to curb this tendency could be to adopt a same fixed price per defined daily dose (DDD) for substitutable drugs among a same ATC 4th level (generics and me-too drugs). This would provide incentives to convince physicians and patients to choose the most effective and comfortable drugs (substance, administration way, packaging, etc.) without pernicious effects on expenditure. This strategy makes sense given that physicians are often unaware of the actual cost of medications [30]. Another solution would consist in fixing prices per defined daily dose (DDD) for all products within a same market, which would not change the prices at short term but would at least stabilize them. Of course, innovative drugs (i.e. new substances) might increase expenses ([31] for instance), but this was not studied here, because our results were adjusted by markets (ATC4th level). Finally, although Rx prescription should not depend on expenses\u2019 aspects, the fact that drugs requiring a physician\u2019s prescription tended to be associated with higher expenditure (+ 92 CHF) might suggest that marketing efforts were effective [32].\nThe three remaining levels were responsible for only 5% of the drug expenditure variability, showing that measures based on patients, physicians or cantons should not have a great impact on costs reduction. At the patient level, we found that elderly and patients with multi-morbid conditions might receive more costly drugs to avoid interaction for instance, confirming the results of previous studies [33]. The contrasts observed for the other patient-level variables (deductible and gender) were small. These results confirm the weak role of patients in choosing treatments, even if a greater involvement of them might be desirable [34]. Although the physician level was associated to less than 1.7% of the drug expenditure variance, variables that were introduced in our model at this level (i.e. type of physician and their propensity of using recently introduced drugs) explained half of it. Finally, it is interesting to see that regional disparities were relatively slight, contrarily to other geographic comparison of drug consumption in Switzerland [35].\nThe main finding of this study is that drug recentness was associated with an increase in drug expenditure, confirming former studies stating that pharmaceuticals recently introduced to the Swiss market generated higher costs [36]. In most economic sectors, new products enables the competitors to keep market shares, in a context of stable or decreasing prices. But, in the drug sector, it is a way to increase expenditure. Moreover, we found that several other aspects of the economic theory of perfect competition did not apply (e.g. more concurrence and higher deductibles were not associated with a decrease in drug expenditure). Such results are congruent with former researches on the absence of effect of the co-payment on rational use of medicines [37], and on the weak impact of financial incentives on prescribing medicines [38, 39]. They also provide evidence that the drug market cannot be considered as a \u201cperfect market\u201d, knowing that the patient is the customer, the decision is medical, the payment is not made by the insurance, the pharmaceutical industry sometimes has a dominant position, the entry of a new supplier into the market is not easy, and the substitution among products is not always possible [13].\nOur study had some limitations. First, we assumed that physicians might substitute drugs in each market without damaging the efficacy of treatment. Even if this assumption should hold in most of the cases, physicians might have good reasons to choose a more costly drug, e.g. to provide a better comfort to the patient (administration mode for instance), or to avoid some side effects or drugs\u2019 interactions [40], especially for multi-morbid patients [41]. However, we adjusted our results for age and comorbidity index and only substitution among the same or similar substances were taken into account.\nSecond, our dataset was relatively old (i.e. 2006). There is no guarantee that the results obtained that year would be identical today. For this reason, this analysis should be seen as historical (or even pioneer), illustrating which kind of conclusions might be obtained with similar data and model. For instance, asserting that the variables linked to market and treatments (generic, etc.) explain respectively 76% and 20% of the variance of annual treatment costs provides an information that is crucial to know to take sensible decisions. Whereas it is well known that superficial innovations (co-marketing, packaging, etc.) might help imposing higher prices, it is also important to confirm it empirically and, eventually, to measure the magnitude of this effect. If our results were to be confirmed with updated data, it would indicate that it is probably more effective to act on the structure of the market than to target patients or doctors. An analysis with more updated data would also enable to take into\naccount new aspects such as the emergence of healthcare networks or biosimilar drugs [42, 43].\nSome drivers of drugs\u2019 expenditures in 2006 Switzerland\u2019s market might well still play an important role in today\u2019s drug market, both markets displaying several similarities (e.g. many substitutable drugs, new products regularly introduced in the reimbursement list of drugs). However, we must also mention some changes that have occurred in 16\u00a0years, such as the apparition of new treatments against cancer and autoimmune diseases, an increased pressure of Federal authorities on prices since 2012, and a growing market share for generics. We could thus only encourage further research on this subject with updated data to see whether and to which extent results obtained here still apply, in Switzerland or in other countries, and we hope that this study will motivate stakeholders to make the required datasets available in the near future.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank the insurers and the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health for providing the data.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions AD and YE were at the origin of this study and made first exploratory analyses.
