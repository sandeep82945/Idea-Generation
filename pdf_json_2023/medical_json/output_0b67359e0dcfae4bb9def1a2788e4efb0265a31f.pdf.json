In addition, the residents\u2019 cancer incidence was further analyzed through authorized health data collection.\nResults: The results showed that the gross \u03b1 and gross \u03b2 radioactivity in all types of drinking water were ranged from 0.008 to 0.017 Bq/L and 0.032 to 0.112 Bq/L, respectively. The cumulative ambient dose in Sanmen county ranged from 0.254 to 0.460 mSv/y, with an average of 0.354\u00b1 0.075 mSv/y. There is no statistical di erence in drinking water radioactivity and ambient dose before and after the operation of SNPP according to Mann\u2013Whitney U test. The Mann-Kendall test also indicates there is neither increasing nor decreasing trend during the period from 2014 to 2021. The age-dependent annual e ective doses due to the ingestion of drinking water or exposure to the outdoor ambient environment are lower than the recommended threshold of 0.1 mSv/y. The incidence of cancer (include leukemia and thyroid cancer) in the population around SNPP is slightly higher than that in other areas, while it is still in a stable state characterized by annual percentage changes.\nDiscussion: The current comprehensive results show that the operation of SNPP has so far no evident radiological impact on the surrounding environment and public health, but continued monitoring is still needed in the future.\nKEYWORDS\nSanmen nuclear power plant, radioactivity, risk assessment, drinking water, ambient dose\n1. Introduction\nTo achieve the goal of carbon neutralization by 2060 (1), China has set its national strategy to develop various new energy technologies, and nuclear power development is one of the important means. Currently, there are 55 nuclear power plants (NPPs) in operation and 18 under construction in China (2). With the fast growth of nuclear power industry, the changes of environmental radioactivity levels and associated health impacts receive increasing recognition by the residents in the surrounding areas of NPPs (3\u20135), especially after the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident in 2011. To this end, many countries have carried out surveillance programs for radioactivity monitoring and radiological risk assessment before and after the operation of NPPs (6, 7).\nFrontiers in Public Health 01 frontiersin.org\nSanmen NPP (SNPP), located in Sanmen county, Zhejiang Province, is the first Chinese nuclear power plant in operation applying advanced passive (AP1000) technology, which is claimed as the safest and most advanced commercial nuclear power technology in the global nuclear power market. However, emission of radioactive debris or effluents into the environment through air and water might be inevitable during its operation. The atmospheric and liquid discharges from an AP1000 reactor estimated by Westinghouse were 1.1 \u00d7 1013 Bq and 3.3 \u00d7 1013 Bq, respectively, which are comparable with releases from a 1,000 MWe pressured water reactor in Europe (8). Therefore, it is important to assess the impacts of the operation of SNPP on the radiation safety of the surrounding environment and the local public, and evaluate the merit of AP1000 technology toward radiation protection. To the best of our knowledge, very few data have been reported so far regarding the effects of the operation of AP1000 nuclear power units on the environmental radioactivity and radiation exposure (9). Therefore, it is necessary to track and monitor the radioactivity level of radiation exposure before and after the operation of the nuclear power plant, so as to grasp the radioactivity situation and change trend in time.\nInternal and external radiation exposure are the two main ways that radiation affects the health of human body. According to the report of United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) in 2000 (10), drinking water is considered to be an important factor in increasing radiation exposure to humans. People who are exposed to relatively high levels of radioactivity in drink water and ambient environment for a long period may develop serious health problems, such as cancer (11).\nThis study was designed to investigate radioactivity levels in drinking water and ambient radiation before and after the operation of the first Chinese AP1000 nuclear power unit from 2014 to 2021. Base on the time-series observation data, the annual effective dose (AED) and excess risk (ER) of different age groups were estimated. The effect of operation of SNPP on the public health as indicated by the incidence of cancer in the population around the NPP was also evaluated."

In this work, water samples including raw water, factory water and tap water were collected in May and November for each year from 2014 to 2021 at fixed stations around SNPP. The sampling locations for different waters are shown in Figure 1. In total, 92 raw water samples were collected during 2014\u2013 2021 from 5 reservoirs, 1 well and 1 stream. In addition, 40 factory water samples from 3 waterworks and 40 tap water samples from the health building of Sanmen country, hospitals and residents\u2019 house were collected.\nIn the sampling collection, 5 L of each water sample was directly transferred to a plastic container, and acidified immediately with 100 ml of nitric acid to minimize the absorption of radioactivity onto the wall of the container. After transporting back to the lab, the sample was evaporated to dryness at 150\u25e6C, and calcined at\n450\u25e6C for 8 h. The residue was then transferred to a sample tray for gross \u03b1 and gross \u03b2 counting. The radioactivity concentrations of gross \u03b1 and gross \u03b2 were measured using the \u03b1/\u03b2 counting system (BH1217II, China National Nuclear Corporation, China; LB790, Berthold Technologies, Germany), the counting time was 1,000 min."

The leukemia and thyroid\ncancers were selected for specific investigation because of their radiosensitivity (21).\nCrude incidence is calculated by dividing the annual number of cases by the number of people exposed during the same period. In order to enable comparative analysis in the same dimension, we used the Chinese standard population in 2000 and World Segi\u2019s population as the base to calculate the age-standardized rates of incidence of China (ASRIC) and the age-standardized rates of incidence of World (ASRIW), respectively. The annual percentage change (APC) was adopted to characterize the temporal trends of incidence, using the Joinpoint model (Version 4.9.0.0).\nThe collection of health data relied on the Chronic Disease Management System in Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which was authorized by Zhejiang provincial government.

The measured gross \u03b1 and gross \u03b2 activities in all water samples were below the WHO recommended thresholds (0.5 Bq/L for gross \u03b1, 1.0 Bq/L for gross \u03b2) (22) and generally at the lower end compared to the surveys carried out at a global scale (23\u201329).\nThe average values of gross \u03b1 radioactivity concentrations for three types of water samples in 2014\u20132021 were 0.010 \u00b1 0.003 Bq/L, 0.009 \u00b1 0.002 Bq/L, and 0.009 \u00b1 0.002 Bq/L, respectively, while the averages of gross \u03b2 were 0.060\u00b1 0.024 Bq/L, 0.048\u00b1 0.008 Bq/L, and 0.043 \u00b1 0.016 Bq/L, respectively. Taking uncertainties into account, the average gross \u03b1 or gross \u03b2 radioactivity concentrations were comparable among these three types of drinking water. Compared to the reported gross \u03b1 and \u03b2 radioactivity concentrations in tap waters collected from the surroundings of NPPs in other six provinces (Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and Liaoning) in China, the levels of gross \u03b1 and gross \u03b2 radioactivity in Sanmen tap water were relatively low (see Table 3) (30). The result of this study is consistent with the survey of the Qinshan NPP from 2012 to 2020 (31), confirming the drinking water gross \u03b1 and gross \u03b2 radioactivity in Zhejiang Province is still at the background level.\nFrontiers in Public Health 04 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "new leukemia cases were reported from 2014 to 2021 for the residents around SNPP, with a crude incidence of 11.03/100,000, an ASIRC of 8.59/100,000, and an ASIRW of 8.91/100,000, (see Table 11). The ASIRC of leukemia was stable over the period with the 0.2% of APC (95% CI: \u22126.8% to 7.7%), and kept at the same level as that in Zhejiang Province from 2010 to 2014 (ASIRC: 5.26/100,000; ASIRW: 5.60/100,000) (40).\nA total of 1,642 new thyroid cancer cases were reported for the residents around SNPP in 2014\u20132021, with a crude incidence rate of 46.20/100,000, an ASIRC of 37.14/100,000, and an ASIRW of 32.68/100,000. These values are slightly higher than the incidence in China (ASIRC: 12.05/100,000; ASIRW:10.44/10,000) (41), and show a slight upward trend (ASIRC: APC = 5.9%,; ASIRW: APC = 5.3%), which is consistent with that observed in China and other countries (42\u201346). There are many factors contributing to the increase in thyroid cancer incidence, such as ionizing radiation, iodine intake, female hormones, and body mass index (BMI) (47). It is also likely related to the availability and improvement of thyroid gland imaging examination techniques (47, 48), and may even reflect \u201coverdiagnosis\u201d through increased use of new imaging technologies (49, 50), thus increasing the detection of thyroid cancer cases. However, the increase rate of the incidence of thyroid cancer in residents of Sanmen county from 2014 to 2021 is less than the relevant data reported in Zhejiang Province (48) (APC = 28.62%) and nationwide in China (APC = 12.4%) (51), and the incidence is controllable at present.\nThe health effects of radiation on residents around the NPP need to be observed over a long period of time. Due to the short operation time of SNPP, the current investigation results have not indicated any impact on the health of residents around the NPP. The radiation safety for the environment and human health in the surrounding area of SNPP was secured in the past years, with the successful application of advanced AP1000 technology in SNPP. We acknowledge that the present study may not enable us to identify and quantify the merits of AP1000 technology in terms of radiation protection, e.g., possibly less radioactive releases during the operation compared to traditional nuclear power technologies. Continued monitoring for the public health state and further investigations on\nthe spatiotemporal distribution of some specific radionuclides (such as fission products) in the surrounding environment of SNPP would be needed to fill our knowledge gap."

            "text": "This study investigated the radioactivity levels of drinking water, background radiation in the ambient environment, and cancer incidence status in the residents around SNPP from 2014 to 2021. The results showed that radioactivity concentrations of gross \u03b1 and gross \u03b2 in all types of drinking water were lower than the recommended values by WHO, and the measured ambient environmental accumulated doses were all at background levels. Statistical analysis indicated neither monotonic changing trend over 2014\u20132021, nor statistical difference does before and after the operation of SNPP in the drinking water gross \u03b1 and gross \u03b2 radioactivity and ambient environmental accumulated. Cancer incidences for the residents in Sanmen county was slightly higher than that in other areas, while it was kept relatively stable for all cancers combined and leukemia cancer over the period of 2014\u2013 2021. The current comprehensive results show that the operation of SNPP has so far no evident radiological impact on the surrounding environment and public health, but continued monitoring is still needed in the future.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
