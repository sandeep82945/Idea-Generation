 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Synthesize the proposed drug candidates in the lab to validate their improved binding affinities over current glaucoma drugs like dichlorphenamide. This would provide experimental proof for the computational predictions. 

2. Test the drug candidates in cell cultures or animal models (e.g. mice) to evaluate their efficacy in lowering intraocular pressure. This would demonstrate their potential clinical usefulness.

3. Modify the drug candidates further through iterative computational modeling and synthetic chemistry to optimize potency, selectivity, bioavailability, and other drug-like properties.

4. Evaluate the drug candidates for potential off-target effects, toxicity, and side effects through additional computational and experimental screening. This would assess their safety profile. 

5. Design prodrugs or drug delivery systems (e.g. eye drops, implants) to improve the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of the drug candidates for glaucoma treatment. This could enhance their clinical practicality.
