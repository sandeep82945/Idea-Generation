In those contexts, participation in sports is considered as a vehicle of learning and cultivating how to cooperate, negotiate, and resolve moral conflicts and how to be courageous, fair, loyal, and persistent (Shields and Bredemeier, 1995). However, the increasing news of unethical behaviors\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 771332\nreported in competitive scenarios led the public to suspect the view \u201csports shape great characters.\u201d There are various violations of sports ethics (e.g., insulting, attacking, and cheating) in all levels of sports competition. Moreover, no punishment for those violations not only undermine the value of competitive fairness ethically and morally, but also seriously damage the physical and mental health of athletes. Therefore, in the field of sports psychology, more and more attention has been given to the research on sports ethics and their influencing factors.\nPrevious findings indicated that psychological factors were considered as the significant roles in affecting athletes\u2019 sports ethics, especially for perfectionism. Perfectionism is usually defined as a personality pursuing perfection and setting the most stringent specification, accompanied by a tendency to overevaluate their own behavior (Hamachek, 1978; Hewitt et al., 1989). Generally, there are two basic dimensions: perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns. The former one was a positive characteristic that individuals prefer to set themselves higher performance standards and strive for it; by contrast, the later one was a negative characteristic that individuals fear to face devastated evaluation when they do not meet standards (Stoeber and Otto, 2006). It is crucial to distinguish between perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns when exploring the influencing factors and consequences (Hamachek, 1978), since those two dimensions were totally different and even led to opposing outcomes. Perfectionistic concerns are often positively related to negative processes and outcomes, whereas perfectionistic strivings are often positively related to positive processes and outcomes (or negatively related to negative processes and outcomes) (Stoeber, 2011; Gotwals et al., 2012). A research by Grugan et al. (2020) found that self-directed perfectionism was negatively related to antisocial behavior, whereas other-directed perfectionism was positively related to antisocial behavior. In Madigan et al. (2016), male adolescent athletes were recruited to examine the relationship between perfectionism and doping attitudes. Their findings indicate that perfectionistic strivings were negatively correlated with attitudes in favoring doping. Further, there was no correlation between perfectionistic concerns and attitudes using doping (Madigan et al., 2016). Zhu et al. (2015) found that individuals who worried about making mistakes would receive pressure from coaching and were negatively correlated with prosocial behaviors but positively correlated with antisocial behaviors.\nTo date, sports ethics have been discussed from different aspects based on the different theories. Notably, the achievement goal theory served as the most extensive theory on this topic. Achievement goal theory was proposed with a 2 \u00d7 2 format. The two criteria are the capability of others or self-reference and the value of goal, and the four types would be mastery approach, performance approach, mastery avoidance, and performance avoidance (Elliot, 1999).\nConsidering previous studies and the theory background above, there was always an indirect relationship between perfectionism and other outcome variables. Therefore, it could be assumed that the mediating role of achievement goals between athletes\u2019 perfectionism and sports ethics might exist and be worth further exploring. Indeed, findings from the previous study have confirmed that Achievement Goals were\nrelated to perfectionism and sports ethics, respectively, in sports scenarios. Corrion et al. (2010) found that performance approach and achievement avoidance could positively predict deceptive acceptability, and mastery approach and mastery avoidance could negatively predict deceptive acceptability. In addition, studies found that perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns had different relationships with achievement goals in sports scenarios (Stoeber et al., 2009; Barkoukis et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2020). Perfectionistic strivings showed a positive correlation with mastery approach and performance approach goals, and perfectionistic concerns showed a positive correlation with mastery avoidance and performance avoidance. Similarly, perfectionistic strivings might mainly focus on approach, whereas perfectionistic concerns might mainly focus on avoidance.\nPerfectionism has the potential for affecting sports ethics through achievement goals. That is to say, achievement goals might play a mediating role in the relationship between perfectionism and sports ethics. However, existing studies did not pay attention to this, and such a research question remains unexplored. To fulfill the gap, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship among athletes\u2019 perfectionism, achievement goals, and sports ethics based on achievement goal theory. Hypotheses were given as follows:\n(1) Perfectionistic strivings would positively predict the sports ethics of athletes, whereas perfectionistic concerns would negatively predict the sports ethics of athletes. (2) Mastery approach and mastery avoidance would positively predict athletes\u2019 sports ethics, and performance approach and performance avoidance would negatively predict athletes\u2019 sports ethics. (3) Mastery approach and performance approach would partially mediate the relationship between perfectionistic strivings and sports ethics, and mastery avoidance and performance avoidance would partially mediate the relationship between perfectionistic concerns and sports ethics."

The results showed that the direct effects model was well fitted (\u03c72/df = 3.54, RMSEA = 0.06, NFI = 0.95, IFI = 0.96, CFI = 0.96).

            "text": "The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between multidimensional perfectionism and sports ethics among young\nathletes, and the mediating role of achievement goals between multidimensional perfectionism and sports ethics might exist.\nFindings of this study indicated that perfectionistic strivings could positively predict sports ethics, whereas perfectionistic concerns could negatively predict sports ethics. Stoeber and Otto argued that perfectionistic strivings referred to an inner drive and an adaptive personality setting higher personal standards or being excellent (Stoeber and Otto, 2006). On the contrary, perfectionistic concerns refer to a negative emotional response, worrying about mistakes, fearing failure, and self-criticizing severely, which depends on the performance (Stoeber and Otto, 2006). Different relationship patterns with positive or negative psychological outcomes were attributed to the two different dimensions. Studies showed that perfectionistic strivings were positively correlated with wellness for success, competitive confidence, internal attribution of success, positive emotional responses to great sports performance, and goal orientation (Stoeber et al., 2007, 2008; Chen et al., 2008; Stoeber and Becker, 2008; Sagar and Stoeber, 2009). Nevertheless, perfectionistic concerns were positively associated with failure fear (avoidance of failure), competition anxiety, external attribution of success, goal avoidance, and burnout (Stoeber et al., 2007, 2008; Chen et al., 2008; Stoeber and Becker, 2008; Sagar and Stoeber, 2009). For perfectionistic strivings, perfectionists tried their best to make it with obtaining satisfaction and self-affirmation. Process of being appreciative might be violated if abuse, attack, and\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 771332\ndeception behaviors exist in the competitive scenarios. But for perfectionistic concerns, perfectionists who overestimated themselves with unrealistic standards might lead to protecting self-worth and avoiding failure and judgment. It might be easier for individuals to generate abuses, attacks, and deception behaviors to shy away from negative outcomes or judgment under standard rules (Gagne, 2003).\nAlso, the findings indicated that mastery approach and mastery avoidance could positively predict athletes\u2019 sports ethics significantly, and performance -approach and performance avoidance could negatively predict athletes\u2019 sports ethics significantly. In line with the previous studies, the more the athletes focused on mastery goals, the less they agreed with executing unethical behaviors (Barkoukis et al., 2011). The impact of mastery goals on sports ethics did not change with those two dimensions, and the task-focused goals may be a protector for violating behaviors, such as abuse, assault, and deception. It would be easier for athletes pursuing mastery to show compliance with the rules and fair competition, because they care more about task completion and skill improvement than other goals. For them, all rule-violated behaviors would undermine the appreciating process of enhancing skill or mastery of the tasks when they were driven by mastery goals (Corrion et al., 2010). On the other hand, the higher performance goals the athletes held, the more likely they would violate sports ethics, regardless of the use of performance approach or performance avoidance. Nicholls (1989) supported that focusing on achievement goals may lead to a lack of attention to justice, fairness, and the welfare of others.\nIn addition, the study findings indicated that performance approach and mastery approach could partially mediate the relationship between perfectionistic strivings and sports ethics. In detail, perfectionistic strivings negatively predicted sports ethics through performance approach, but it also positively predicted sports ethics through mastery approach. Consistent with the previous studies, perfectionistic strivings were positively correlated with the orientation of approaching goals (Stoeber et al., 2008). Perfectionistic strivings were an adaptive personality with a tendency setting high standards or an internal drive pursuing excellence (Stoeber and Otto, 2006). Individuals with perfectionistic strivings were usually success-oriented, which meant that they hoped to demonstrate their capability strongly and were more easily to accept performance approach and mastery approach. Sun et al. (2014) indicated that when performance approach got dominant, defeating their opponents was perceived as success and they would make it by anyway, even violating sports ethics. However, when mastery avoidance became dominant, athletes would pay more attention to improvement or mastery of the skills rather than using fraud or aggression behaviors to achieve success. Therefore, when athletes tend to use performance approach, they will be more likely to adopt behaviors violating sports ethics, whereas when athletes tend to use mastery approach, they will have more potential to refuse those unethical behaviors.\nFinally, the findings from this study also showed that mastery avoidance and performance avoidance could partially mediate the relationship between perfectionistic concerns and sports\nethics. Perfectionistic concerns could negatively predict sports ethics via performance avoidance and positively predict sports ethics by mastery avoidance. Previous studies have shown that perfectionistic concerns were positively correlated with mastery avoidance (Stoeber et al., 2008). Perfectionistic concerns were a non-adaptive form of perfectionism, which demonstrated constant worries about mistakes, fears of failure, severe selfcriticism, and negative emotional responses (Stoeber and Otto, 2006). Perfectionistic concerns were guided by avoiding failure, trying their best to avoid showing normative incompetence and avoiding introspective incompetence, and individuals are more likely to accept performance avoidance and mastery avoidance. Capability did not change the influence of achievement goals on the acceptability of unethical behaviors (Corrion et al., 2010). When athletes oriented by performance avoidance, they would be more likely to approve the use of unethical behaviors, but when athletes oriented by mastery avoidance goals, they would be more likely to follow the standard rules.\nThere were some limitations that should be noted. First, the sample size of this study is relatively small. Future studies with larger sample size are needed to avoid bias representation and increase the generalizability of findings. Second, the nature of observational study does not allow the demonstration of causality. Future experimental studies are needed to further examine relationships between those variables.\nSince perfectionism and goal orientation execute a greater impact on sports ethics, this study findings may provide guidance on education practice. To prevent athletes from using unethical behaviors, strategies should be developed to reduce perfectionistic concerns and increase their perfectionistic strivings, which could reduce the sense of intimidation and pressure to a certain extent, so that they can continue to enjoy themselves in sports and realize their potential. In addition, mastery approach may be a protective factor for athletes to avoid unethical behaviors. Therefore, coaches and parents should be encouraged to create a mastery environment, such as designing various tasks of difficulty levels, allowing athletes to practice within their own capability, or encouraging them to set specific short-term goals based on their own practice. Also, timely evaluation and recognition of athletes\u2019 progress and achievements will be a great means for cultivating mastery approach and help them succeed."
