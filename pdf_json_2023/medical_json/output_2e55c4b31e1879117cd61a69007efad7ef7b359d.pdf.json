    "abstractText": "Background and objective The clinical course in patients with tracheal stenosis (TS) ranges from being asymptomatic to respiratory failure requiring follow-up in the ICU. In this study, we aimed to assess the clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of TS patients who were admitted to the ICU. Materials and methods The data of patients hospitalized in the ICU due to TS between January 01, 2015, and January 01, 2016, were analyzed. The patients were classified into two groups: the post-intubation tracheal stenosis (PITS) group and the post-tracheostomy tracheal stenosis (PTTS) group. Demographic characteristics, body mass index (BMI), the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of patients, factors that caused TS, management of TS, and ICU data of patients were compared. The outcome measures of our study were the ICU management of patients diagnosed with PITS or PTTS, their clinical characteristics, and differences in the treatment between patients diagnosed with PITS and those with PTTS in the ICU. Results Fifteen (75%) patients had PITS and five (25%) had PTTS. While BMI was significantly lower in patients in the PTTS group, the APACHE II and SOFA scores were significantly higher in PTTS patients (p<0.05). In most of the patients in the PITS group, the location of the stenosis was subglottic and at the 1/3 upper part of the trachea, while in the PTTS group, it was located only at the upper 1/3 of the trachea (p>0.05). Mechanical dilatation was performed in all patients in both groups. Mechanical dilatation and cryotherapy were performed in 10 (66.7%) patients in the PITS group (p>0.05), and a stent was applied in addition to this treatment in three (20%) patients in the PITS group and four (80%) patients in the PTTS group (p<0.05). Mechanical ventilation was not needed in 10 (66.7%) PITS patients and three (60.0%) PTTS patients after the interventional procedure. All patients were eventually discharged from the ICU after treatment. Conclusion While higher BMI was common in PITS patients, the PTTS patients were generally in worse condition. In this patient group, interventional pulmonology procedures in the ICU can be life-saving. Categories: Anesthesiology, Cardiac/Thoracic/Vascular Surgery, Pulmonology",

            "text": "Tracheal stenosis (TS) is an uncommon but life-threatening condition. Despite major advances in medicine, it is still a significant concern in clinical practice. The etiology of TS is frequently associated with conditions such as congenital diseases, post-intubation tracheal stenosis (PITS), post-tracheostomy stenosis (PTTS), tracheal tumor, and external compression on the trachea [1,2]. Despite the scarcity of data regarding TS incidence, acquired TS is often linked to PITS, with a reported incidence ranging from 0.6% to 21% [3]. The estimated annual incidence of PITS and PTTS cases in the general population is 4.9 cases per million [1]. While TS develops due to compression caused by the intubation tube cuff in PITS patients, it is caused by tracheotomy stoma and tracheal cartilage in patients with PTTS [4].\nDepending on the severity of the stenosis in TS, patients may manifest conditions ranging from being asymptomatic to respiratory failure [3]. The clinical conditions of TS patients may deteriorate rapidly and they may often need ICU management. Due to TS and the comorbidities that accompany it, the management of these patients in the ICU can be quite challenging for intensivists. Besides ICU follow-ups,\nHow to cite this article Parpucu U, Aydemir S (September 26, 2023) Our Clinical Experience With Patients Requiring Intensive Care for Tracheal Stenosis: A Retrospective Case-Control Study. Cureus 15(9): e45978. DOI 10.7759/cureus.45978\nmany interventional pulmonology procedures are also performed in these patients [5]. Interventional bronchoscopy procedures are a preferred method used before surgical treatment due to their curative benefits for many patients, including those who are candidates for surgery [6]. Even though most of the patients benefit from these interventions, some patients may require re-admission to the ICU and repeat interventional procedures. A comprehensive clinical evaluation and a multidisciplinary approach often lead to positive outcomes in these patients.\nIn this retrospective case-control study, we aimed to highlight the clinical features, management, and ICU treatment outcomes among 20 consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of either PITS or PTTS."

            "text": "Based on our findings, PTTS patients had higher APACHE II and SOFA scores and lower BMI values. Interventional procedures were also different in both groups. Although the patient data is limited, particularly in the PTTS group, our study differs from similar studies as we included critical patients who needed ICU care. Zias et al. [8] evaluated PITS and PTTS patients in a study where the majority of patients were obese females with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, when the history of comorbidities among PITS and PTTS patients was evaluated, there was a predominance of patients with multiple comorbidities and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This could be attributed to the fact that our institution is a reference hospital for patients with chronic respiratory diseases, particularly COPD.\nThe association between gender and TS development is a controversial issue, and it has been emphasized that this situation may be associated with idiopathic TS [9-11]. In our study, we did not observe any significant differences in terms of gender. In addition, the high number of male patients in the PITS group may be related to the high number of COPD patients. BMI was higher in the PITS group and APACHE II and SOFA scores were found to be higher in the PTTS group during ICU admission. BMI was not at a morbidly obese level, and this is consistent with the findings in the literature [8]. In addition, we think that lower BMI accompanied by higher APACHE II and SOFA scores in the PTTS group may be associated with poor nutritional status and prolonged chronic processes in the PTTS patients.\nThere are varying results in the literature regarding the duration of stenosis development after intubation or tracheostomy [8,12]. Although there is much data about the PITS etiology in the literature, it remains a matter of controversy. Compression and ischemia-induced necrosis are thought to be significant factors as they can cause mechanical damage to the tracheal mucosa. Local infections, low blood pressure, steroid administration, sensitivity to intubation materials, and, in addition to all these factors, many individual problems may also cause TS [12-14]. All these factors may be related to the time of development of PITS. In our study, this period was found to be 14.38 days. Stenosis due to tracheostomy usually develops in the tracheostomy stoma. Cartilage damage, abnormal cartilage tissue healing, granulation tissue development, and local infections can cause stenosis. Also, prolonged intubation time before tracheotomy can play a role in the development of stenosis [10]. Usually, TS development takes more time in tracheotomies than in PITS cases. In our study, the average time for TS development was 73.33 days with the shortest being 30 days and the longest 180 days.\nIt has been stated in the literature that the degree of TS is generally over 50%. In addition, stenosis localization is mostly subglottic and located at the 1/3 upper level of the trachea [7,9,13]. In the present study, although the localization was similar to what is described in the literature, the level of stenosis was observed to be over 71-99% in many patients according to the Myer-Cotton subglottic stenosis grading scale [7]. This may explain why patients need urgent ICU admissions. All of our patients needed mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory distress.\nVarious interventional treatment strategies have been employed for the management of patients with PITS or PTTS [4,6,8,15,16]. The location of the stenosis, the reason for TS, comorbidities, and the degree of stenosis are the main factors considered in choosing the appropriate treatment procedure. A careful assessment and multidisciplinary approach are the keys to success [4]. These become even more important in critical patients who need ICU admission. In our cases, we determined the treatment plans for the patients after their critical conditions were managed in the ICU. In both groups, before the procedure-related decisions were made, stenosis characteristics were evaluated by fiber optic bronchoscope or CT. In this study, mechanical dilatation and cryotherapy were the preferred methods in all patients, and stents were also used in three patients in the PITS group and four patients in the PTTS group. Surgery may not be suitable for a small subset of patients who develop PITS. In these patients, stents can be applied to prevent the development of life-threatening restenosis and to enhance patient comfort. This may give the patient a chance until surgery is deemed safe. Although stent placement is considered a last resort, it may be required in the presence of tracheomalacia, especially in stenoses due to tracheotomy [4,12,14]. In our study, all patients were eventually discharged from the ICU. We believe that interventional bronchoscopic procedures reduce respiratory distress and are beneficial during the discharge process.\n2023 Parpucu et al. Cureus 15(9): e45978. DOI 10.7759/cureus.45978 5 of 7\nThis study has a few limitations. It was retrospective in design and conducted at a single center. In addition, the number of patients was quite different between the groups; however, this is due to the low possibility of encountering these patients. At the same time, it should be noted that some PTTS patients may also have PITS, and we did not classify the patients in this way. Additionally, there was no data regarding the tracheostomy method for all patients who developed tracheal stenosis due to tracheostomy. Moreover, there was no follow-up of our patients after discharge from the ICU. Since the number of patients in our study was small and it was a single-center study, the results cannot be generalized to the broader population; there is also a potential for selection bias, and prospective studies with a larger number of patients are required to gain more insights into the topic."

            "text": "The management of patients with PITS or PTTS can be very challenging in the ICU. Higher BMI is fairly common, particularly in PITS patients. Interventional pulmonology procedures are of vital importance for ICU discharge in these patients. The main benefits of interventional pulmonology procedures are that they reduce hospital stays and help avoid the necessity for ICU care. Additionally, these are less intrusive. We recommend more prospective research involving ICU patients on this topic.\nAdditional Information"
