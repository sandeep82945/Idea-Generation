The 4a and 4b structures crystallized in monoclinic and triclinic systems with space\ngroups P21/n and P 1, respectively. Theoretical calculations were performed at the DFT/B3LYP level for the optimized geometries. The results were in excellent agreement with the experimental data\n(spectroscopic and XRD). This investigation encompasses molecular modeling studies including Hirshfeld\nsurface analysis, energy framework calculations, and frontier molecular orbital analysis. Intermolecular\ninteractions within the crystal structures of the compounds were explored through Hirshfeld surface\nanalysis, which revealed the notable presence of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This\ninsight provides valuable information on the structural stability and potential solubility characteristics of\nthese compounds. The research was extended to docking analysis with eight distinct kinases (BRAF,\nHER2, CSF1R, MEK2, PDGFRA, JAK, AKT1, and AKT2). The results of this analysis demonstrate that both\n4a and 4b interact effectively with the kinase-binding sites through a combination of hydrophobic\ninteractions and hydrogen bonding. Compound 4a had the best affinity for proteins; this is related to the\nfact that the compound is not rigid and has a small size, allowing it to sit well at any binding site. This\nstudy contributes to the advancement of kinase inhibitor research and offers potential avenues for the\ndevelopment of new therapeutic agents for cancer treatment."

This ATP-binding site is located between the two lobes of the protein and is connected by a hinge region with a short chain of hydrogen-bonded clusters in an acceptor\u2013 donor\u2013acceptor arrangement (see Fig. 1). Both ATP and most ATP-competing kinase inhibitors use hydrogen-bond interactions with the hinge region. Generally, kinase inhibitors are designed around a heterocyclic scaffold that forms hydrogen bonds with the hinge region and interacts with an ATP-binding pocket.5\nDifferent heterocyclic structures serve as the basis for the generation of kinase inhibitors, among which pyrazolo[3,4-b] pyridine derivatives stand out, in addition to demonstrating interesting inhibitory properties in the many main families of kinases. It has biological properties such as antitumor, antioxidant, anti-inammatory, antimicrobial, and therapeutic effects in autoimmune diseases.2,6\u201311 Recently, Barghash et al., reported the synthesis and evaluation of novel pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives as potential anticancer agents. Screening of pyrazolo [3,4-b]pyridine derivatives for antitumor activity revealed that several compounds exhibited potent anticancer effects. Among the tested compounds, pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine 8a showed the most efficient antiproliferative activity, with broad-spectrum activity against almost all examined cancer cell lines (Scheme 1).12 This study suggests that these derivatives have the potential to be used as lead molecules for the development of potent anticancer candidates.12\u201315\nHowever, it has been reported that this heterocyclic system possesses two key structural features for kinase inhibition: (a) its ability to form hydrogen bonds and (b) its combination of pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine and an indazole moiety, which allows it to achieve multiple modes of binding both at the hinge region and at different active kinase-binding sites (see Fig. 1).5 Likewise, it has been observed that this scaffold provides various\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nadvantages in terms of intellectual property, biological activities, physical properties, and synthetic exibility, which has aroused great interest among researchers because of the fact that of the total number of references included in SciFinder, around pyrazolo[3,4-b] pyridines since 1908, more than 50% corresponds to the period from 2012 to 2022, showing an almost exponential increase, half of which are patents, clearly indicating that this type of structure currently plays an important role as a scaffold for the development of drug candidates.15\nComputational docking is a potent method for understanding and forecasting the molecular interactions of ligands with various biological receptors such as protein active sites. This fascinating protein\u2013ligand interaction can be used to direct the design of compounds and experiments, offering a vast pool of possibilities for therapeutic use.\nThe understanding of kinase\u2013ligand interactions and selectivity has advanced signicantly over the past few years. Experimentally established structures of more than 2800 catalytic kinase domains from mice and humans have shed significant light on fundamental structural factors.16 Using this knowledge, we selected seven exemplary kinase structures for comparison. With the two most promising ligands, the emphasis was on examining the key structural characteristics in relation to their binding affinities. The structure\u2013activity interactions of these kinases and the possible effects of our ligands were better understood through this preliminary analysis.\nTaking this into account, in the present work, we synthesized and crystallized two nuclei derived from the pyrazolo[3,4-b] pyridine system, which were fully characterized using the experimental techniques XRD, FT-IR, HRMS, and NMR (Scheme 1). Likewise, conrmation of the stable crystal structure has been based on quantum chemistry results, such as geometry optimization, Hirshfeld surface analysis, and energy frame calculations of frontier molecular orbitals additionally, we conducted a molecular docking study of these two molecules\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 30118\u201330128 | 30119\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In contrast, the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) supplies information about a compound's readiness to accept electrons and its susceptibility to nucleophilic attack and is related to properties such as electronegativity (tendency to attract electron density) and electron affinity (ability to accept electrons). In addition, the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals (HOMO\u2013LUMO gap) provides information on chemical reactivity and kinetic stability. A molecule with a high energy gap is associated with low chemical reactivity but high kinetic stability and vice versa (see Fig. 4). Finally, chemical hardness and soness are related to the polarizability of a molecule. In other words, higher hardness implies lower polarizability, whereas higher soness is associated with higher polarizability.\nFig. 4 shows the molecular frontier orbitals of compounds 4a and 4b. For molecule 4a, it is evident that the HOMO orbital has a high electronic density located in the 4-(dimethylamino) phenyl ring; in the case of the LUMO orbital, the region of highest probability is in the ring of the pentanone cycle; on the other hand, for the 4b molecule, the HOMO orbital shows an electron density in the 3-methyl-1-phenylpyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine nucleus, while the LUMO orbital shows that the region of highest probability lies both on the 3-methylpyrazolo[3,4-b] pyridine ring and on the cyclopentanone ring in the molecule.\nIn general, 4a has a smaller HOMO\u2013LUMO gap, less chemical hardness, greater chemical soness, lower electronegativity, and lower electron affinity than 4b.

These characteristics are particularly benecial for kinases with restricted binding sites, such as AKT1 and JAK, which possess smaller cavities incapable of accommodating larger molecules. Notably, compound 4a demonstrated the highest affinity against JAK, with less than a 1.0 kcal mol\u22121 difference compared to the reference compound. While all kinases have the same basic functions as enzymes that enable the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to another molecule, are essential in cell signaling pathways, and may serve as targets for cancer treatment, there are noticeable distinctions in their active sites.40 These variations control the molecules to which each kinase can bind. For instance, the binding sites of HER2 and CSF1R are predominantly negatively charged, which inuences the types of molecules with which they can interact.41\nIn contrast, the active sites of the kinases BRAF, MEK2, and PDGFRA have neutral electrostatic characteristics.42\u201344 JAK, AKT1, and AKT2 have positively charged binding sites, making them attractive to negatively charged ligands.45\u201347 These electrostatic properties have signicant implications for the affinities of compounds 4a and 4b. According to Table 3, compounds 4a and 4b, which are primarily positively charged owing to the presence of nitrogen heteroatoms, demonstrate strong affinities to the binding sites of the kinases HER2 and CSF1R, respectively. Here, the interactions primarily involved charge-positive residues.\nOn the other hand, despite its divergent electrostatic characteristics, compound 4a can attach to JAK with a high degree of affinity because of its smaller size. According to the results of the molecular docking study, these pyrazole derivatives inhibited the activity of HER2, BRAF, JAK, PDGFRA, and AKT1.\nFig. 6 Like Fig. 5, this figure presents a comparative in silico analysis of responding reference ligands, as well as the interactions with compoun interactions of MEK2.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nDespite having lower docking score values than the reference ligand, the docked molecules had signicant score values. Compound 4a showed a better binding affinity to the aforementioned targets than the other two docked molecules. The theoretical foundation for the rational design of novel pyrazolopyridine compounds as cancer inhibitors was provided by these docking results. It also is essential to note that despite the existence of various drug-targeting kinases, these proteins continue to represent a signicant class of drug targets. Thus, the development of specic drugs targeting these targets remains a challenge. This is where pyrazolopyridines come into play, serving as a fundamental fragment capable of binding to specic kinase pockets, and hence, constituting a critical scaffold for kinase drugs, as evidenced in several approved pharmaceuticals.48 Moreover, the structural differences between the binding sites of kinases can be used to dock more suitable fragments, thereby aiding in the achievement of high selectivity for new molecules interacting with these proteins (Fig. 6)."

These are shown as sharp needles in 4a and diffuse spots in\n30126 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 30118\u201330128\ncompound 4b. This last feature can be attributed to the force of these interactions, with di + de z 2.2 (Fig. ESI 12\u2020).\nIn addition, another type of weak interaction was observed in Hirshfeld surface analysis. For example, the ditetrel bond was veried for compound 4a (see Fig. ESI 13\u2020). Only a few examples of this type of interaction, which works as an electron donor in a s-hole noncovalent bond,51,52 with a contribution of around 5.1% with de + di of > 3.6 \u00c5, are shown as an arrow tip pattern in the ngerprint plot.\nIn the case of compound 4b, p/p stacking was also observed, which was veried over the heterocycles in the title compound (see Fig. ESI 14\u2020), with a contribution of approximately 1.3% with de + di z 3.5 \u00c5. This was veried using the shape index surface, which allowed us to determine the presence of these weak interactions. The yellow\u2013orange spots show surface subsidence owing to the proximity of the neighboring moieties, and the blue\u2013green spots show the reciprocal contacts of the moieties that generate the subsidence."

            "text": "Finally, the energy framework53was analyzed to better understand the packing and topology of the crystal structure and supramolecular rearrangement. This method allows the calculation and comparison of different energy components, that is, repulsion (E_rep), electrostatic (E_ele), dispersion (E_dis), polarization (E_pol), and total (E_tot) energies, based on the anisotropy of the topology of pairwise intermolecular interaction energies (see Fig. ESI 15\u2020 and Table 5). The thickness of the cylinder radius indicates the grade of interactions, is directly related to the energy magnitude, and offers information about the stabilization of the crystal packing.54Depending on the direction of the pipe, it can be concluded that the framing is driven by translation or centrosymmetric elements. However, this rearrangement leads to the formation of another weak interaction in the crystal structure.\nThe results of the calculations revealed that dispersion interactions exhibit approximately honeycomb-shaped energy topologies in compound 4a, whereas in compound 4b, this topology zig-zag a ladder-shaped topology.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "Compounds 4a and 4b were characterized by FT-IR, HRMS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and X-ray crystallography. The X-ray ndings showed that 4a crystallized in a monoclinic system with a P21/n space group, Z = 4, and unit cell parameters a = 8.7898(16) \u00c5, b = 5.2594(9) \u00c5, c = 27.871(5) \u00c5, b = 95.483(5)\u00b0, and V = 1282.6(4) \u00c53, whereas compound 4b crystallized in the triclinic system with a P 1 space group, Z = 2, and unit cell parameters a = 8.0100(9) \u00c5, b = 9.8032(11) \u00c5, c = 13.6657(15) \u00c5, b = 74.329(3)\u00b0, and V = 978.40(19) \u00c53. In general, good agreement was found between all the investigated theoretical properties (structural, electronic, and spectroscopic) and the experimental results. Hirshfeld surface analysis shows that intermolecular interactions are constituted mainly by C\u2013H/O contacts, and to a lesser extent by C\u2013H/N contacts, for both compounds. In contrast, FMO analysis and chemical reactivity descriptors revealed that 4a was more reactive and less stable than 4b.\nThe docking results provide a theoretical basis for the rational design of novel pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine compounds as inhibitors for cancer treatment. This study highlighted the potential of these compounds as essential fragments capable of binding to specic kinase pockets, making them a critical scaffold for the development of kinase-targeted drugs. This observation aligns with the use of similar scaffolds in approved pharmaceutical products.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
