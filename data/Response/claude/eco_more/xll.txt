 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Develop new algorithms for preference aggregation in voting mechanisms that better reflect collective preferences while still protecting minority views. This could involve techniques like constrained optimization or multi-objective optimization.

2. Explore different behavioral models and biases to more accurately capture human decision-making in the simulated agents. For example, incorporate models of bounded rationality, prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting, etc.

3. Analyze how network effects and agent interactions influence system equilibria and convergence. Develop graph neural network models or multi-agent influence models to capture socioeconomic interactions. 

4. Establish frameworks for oversight, accountability, and transparency of AI systems used in policymaking. This could involve techniques like interpretable ML and human-AI collaboration.

5. Conduct empirical studies to determine computational and statistical scaling laws of the framework. Identify key model parameters that allow scaling to large populations of agents and complex environments.
