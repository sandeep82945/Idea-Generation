    "abstractText": "We reveal that an introduction of frequency-weighted inter-layer coupling term in networks of frequency dipoles can induce explosive synchronization transitions. The reason for explosive synchronization is that the oscillators with synchronization superiority are moderately suppressed. The findings show that a super-linear correlation induces explosive synchronization in networks of frequency dipoles, while a linear or sub-linear correlation excites chimera-like states. Clearly, the synchronization transition mode of networks of frequency dipoles is controlled by the power-law exponent. In addition, by means of the mean-field approximation, we obtain the critical values of the coupling strength within and between layers in two limit cases. The results of theoretical analysis are in good agreement with those of numerical simulation. Compared with the previous models, the model proposed in this paper retains the topological structure of network and the intrinsic properties of oscillators, so it is easy to realize pinning control.",

For instance, when the monitor suddenly calls \u201cstand up\u201d in class, everyone stands up in unison, which is the synchronization mechanism under a unified command. However, the formation of synchronization in natural environment mainly depends on the cohesion of the system itself. In order to grasp the synchronous behaviors of complex systems, the synchronization dynamics of coupled phase oscillators has been widely studied in recent years [1\u20134]. Among the collective phenomena observed in these systems, the chimera states of coupled phase oscillators have aroused great interest of researchers [5\u201313]. The chimera state here refers to a transient state in the process of synchronization transition, in which some oscillators are locked and the remaining ones are in the drift state, that is, a coexistence state of synchronization and drifting.\nIn the past, researchers always thought that the synchronization in networks of coupled\noscillators was a continuous and gradual phase transition process.

Meanwhile, the system transits abruptly from synchronization to incoherence state as the coupling strength is decreased, and the forward and backward continuations do not overlap, which results in a hysteresis loop [15\u201324].\nIn the field of electro-magnetism, how to analyze the polarization phenomenon of dielec-\ntric, the first thing is to discretize the dielectric into a system composed of multiple electric dipoles. In medical research, some dipole source models that produce scalp potential are established to speculate the source of electrical activity in the brain [25]. In industrial automation devices, when the ferromagnetic target is far enough from the sensor, it can be regarded as a magnetic dipole [26]. Inspired by these ideas, we try to discretize a complex system into a network composed of frequency dipoles. A double-layer network is considered because only one single-layer network is not enough to place multiple pairs of frequency dipoles. In this way, we can use the tool of complex network to study the dynamical behavior of complex systems [27].\nRecently, the synchronization dynamics of multiplex networks has been deeply and care-\nfully studied by employing different methodologies, for instance, phase-shift [28], adaptive inter-layer coupling [29], and inter-layer Hebbian plasticity [30]. As for the choice of coupled oscillators, the Kuramoto oscillator is the most mature and widely used tool in the research field of synchronization theory [31, 32], so it has also become our first choice. We use a double-layer network composed of two globally connected layers as the substrates, in which the upper and lower oscillators form frequency dipoles.\nThe follow-up parts of this paper are organized as follows. First of all, some basic notions\non the frequency dipoles are introduced. In the next place, we give the main results of numerical simulations. Once again, the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation are carried out for the critical values of coupling strength within and between layers in two limit cases. Finally, we summarize our main findings and discuss open problems."

The effective frequencies of the oscillators in the central region of the frequency spectrum tend to be the same, but the effective frequencies of the oscillators at both ends of the spectrum fluctuate greatly, which means that there is a chimera-like state. It is worth noting that the phenomenon is not a chimera state in the real sense. In fact, the chimera state is a unique synchronization phenomenon in a system with identical oscillators, whereas these oscillators in this paper are heterogeneous. Therefore, the phenomenon appearing in Fig 1b is called a chimera-like state.\nFig 2a and 2b show that for the linear correlation, the system also induces a chimera-like\nstate. For the homogeneous coupling and the linear correlation, the processes of phase locking and frequency synchronization of coupled oscillators are similar, that is, the central region is synchronized first, and then extends to both ends. It can be inferred that for the sub-linear correlation, the synchronization transition of the system should be gradual rather than abrupt.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274807.g001\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274807 September 20, 2022 3 / 13\nIn order to characterize the coherence degree of the coupled oscillators in each layer, two\nseparate phase order parameters are considered [33],\nRu\u00f0l\u00deeicu\u00f0l\u00de \u00bc 1\nN\nXN\nj\u00bc1\nei\ufffd u\u00f0l\u00de j \u00f03\u00de\nwhere Ru(l)\ufffd[0, 1] is a measure of the coherence of coupled oscillators in the upper (lower) layer.

Excluding the randomness of initial phases, the network parameters of the upper and lower layers are exactly the same. In order to avoid repetition, the evolution law of order parameter of the lower layer is omitted.\nFig 3 shows that for the sub-linear correlation, a continuous phase transition does occur in\nthe system, which confirms our above inference. However, due to the strong coupling between layers, the system cannot return to the original state after desynchronization. The smaller the value of \u03b2, the worse the desynchronization performance, as shown in Fig 3a."

However, the process of phase locking and frequency synchronization first occurs at both ends, and then gradually spreads to the middle, which is just opposite to Fig 4.\nFor the case of \u03b2 = 1, the frequency synchronization of coupled oscillators starts in the middle of the spectrum, but for \u03b2 = 2, the frequency synchronization first occurs at both ends of the spectrum. We speculate that if \u03b2 takes a value between 1 and 2, the oscillators in the system will not be able to determine the location where synchronization occurs first. Therefore, the oscillators in the system reach a consensus, either out of synchronization or collective synchronization, which leads to the emergence of explosive synchronization.\nTo verify this speculation, both synchronization and desynchronization diagrams are plot-\nted for two different values of \u03b2, as shown in Fig 6. For the super-linear correlation, the system does induce an explosive synchronization. However, due to the influence of inter-layer coupling, the system can not return to the original state after desynchronization.\nFor the super-linear correlation, why does the network induce an explosive synchroniza-\ntion? Our theoretical explanation is as follows. The frequencies of the oscillators who located in the central region of the spectrum of natural frequency are close to the frequency of ensemble equilibrium state, so they are most likely to evolve into condensation nuclei of network synchronization, that is, to achieve synchronization first. However, the oscillators at both ends of the spectrum enjoy greater relative inter-layer coupling strength. Here, the relative interlayer coupling strength refers to the ratio of the absolute inter-layer coupling strength to the positive natural frequency of the frequency dipoles, i.e., lr \u00bc ljo u i j b =joui j \u00bc ljo u i j 1 b . Due to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274807.g004\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274807.g005\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274807 September 20, 2022 5 / 13\nthe difference of advantages, each oscillator in the network has equal opportunity to evolve into the first synchronous condensation center. As long as their advantages are balanced, an explosive synchronization will be ignited.\nNext, we keep the intra-layer coupling strength unchanged and study the synchronization\ntransition characteristics of coupled oscillators by increasing the inter-layer coupling strength. The same law is found that the second-order phase transition occurs in the sub-linear coupled system, as shown in Fig 7a. It is easy to see that there is a hysteresis loop in the super-linear coupled system, indicating the emergence of explosive synchronization, as shown in Fig 7b. It is worth noting that the desynchronization effect is the most thorough in this system.\nNow we systematically study the influence of power-law exponents on the synchronization\ntransition of coupled oscillators. In Fig 8, the order parameter of the upper layer is described by chromaticity in the \u03bb \u2212 \u03bc parameter plane for different power-law exponents. It is generally realized that with the increase of the coupling strength within and between layers, the oscillators in the network tend to be synchronized. The simulation results are consistent with our intuition. For the homogeneous coupling, sub-linear correlation and linear correlation, the boundary lines between different degrees of synchronization is clear and recognizable, as shown in Fig 8a\u20138c. Nevertheless, for the super-linear correlation the boundary lines between different degrees of synchronization are intertwined and even distorted in certain areas as shown in Fig 8d, which may be the internal cause of the emergence of explosive synchronization.\nLet us now investigate the influence of system size on the hysteresis loop width. Fig 9a\nshows the forward and backward continuous diagrams of upper layers of different sizes. It is\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274807.g006\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274807.g007\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274807 September 20, 2022 6 / 13\nfound that the width of the hysteresis loop increases with the size of the system until it reaches saturation. However, there is an interesting phenomenon in the process of backward transition. As shown in Fig 9a, the critical point of the backward continuation in the model is robust, which does not change with the increase of system size [14, 16]. For each size, there is a pair of corresponding forward and backward transition points \u03bcf and \u03bcb, with d = \u03bcf \u2212 \u03bcb. Fig 9b reports the corresponding dependence of< d> on N for twenty realizations. The simulation results show that when the size of the upper layer increases to N = 700 (the size of the lower layer changes synchronously) the width of the hysteresis loop tends to be saturated, which also indicates that the characteristics of explosive synchronization in the system have not changed. Fig 9 verifies that an increase in system size does not change the type of synchronization transition."

For all subsequent simulations, each layer of the network has 200 nodes and 2000 edges. The natural frequency of each oscillator in the upper layer is no longer forcibly specified, but is randomly selected within the interval [-1, 1]. The essence of a pair of frequency dipoles composed of oscillators with the same label in the upper and lower layers continues to be retained. The initial phase of each oscillator is randomly assigned within the range [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0]. Every data point in Figs 11 and 12 is the average of 2000 time steps, after discarding the initial 2000 time steps.\nObviously, hysteresis loops appear in the four panels of Figs 11 and 12, indicating that an\nexplosive synchronization has emerged in both the upper and lower layers. Whether the upper and lower layers are homogeneous or heterogeneous, the super-linear correlation will induce an explosive synchronization.\nNext, we use two different natural frequency distributions and maintain the same network\ntopology as in Fig 12. Here two typical symmetric distributions, unimodal and bimodal Gaussian distributions, are considered. Fig 13 plots the dependence of Ru(Rl) and \u03bb for two different natural frequency distributions. In Fig 13a and 13b, we replace the random uniform distribution by a unimodal Gaussian distribution.

Fig 13 reproduces the same scene as Fig 12. For these two different symmetrical frequency distributions, explosive synchronizations are also activated, independent of network topology. In addition, two kinds of asymmetric frequency distributions, power-law distribution and Rayleigh distribution are tested, which failed to trigger an explosive synchronization. The corresponding synchronization and desynchronization diagrams are not given in this paper. We conclude that only when the natural frequencies of the oscillators satisfy the symmetric distribution, the super-linear correlation can excite an explosive synchronization."
