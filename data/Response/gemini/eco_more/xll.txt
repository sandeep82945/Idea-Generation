1. **Preference Aggregation and Democratic Representation in Voting Mechanisms:** Develop advanced algorithms for aggregating diverse preferences in the Voting Mechanism, ensuring collective preferences are represented while respecting minority views and ensuring a representative simulated population.

2. **Modeling Human Behavior within the Simulator:** Incorporate bounded rationality and cognitive biases into agent behavior models, capturing the nuances of human decision-making in economic settings.

3. **Responsible Oversight Mechanisms for AI Governance:** Establish transparent decision-making processes and legal frameworks for AI systems involved in policy-making, ensuring accountability and responsible oversight.

4. **Exploration of Socioeconomic Interactions:** Analyze the role of network effects and social interactions in economic systems, understanding how these interactions influence agent behavior and policy outcomes.

5. **Scaling Laws and Computational Efficiency:** Investigate the scaling laws of the framework, determining its capacity to simulate economies with thousands or millions of agents and identifying efficient learning and decision-making algorithms for practical implementation.
