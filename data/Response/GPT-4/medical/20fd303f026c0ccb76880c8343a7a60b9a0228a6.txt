Exploration of Genetic and Epigenetic Factors in Early-Onset CRC: Given the findings related to synchronous advanced adenomas and their distribution, further research could focus on identifying specific genetic and epigenetic markers that are associated with the increased risk of early-onset CRC. This could include a detailed analysis of germline and somatic mutations in these patients, with an emphasis on understanding how these mutations contribute to the field cancerization observed in early-onset colon cancer.

Investigation of Lifestyle and Environmental Contributors: The study suggests that there are potentially different pathobiological mechanisms between early-onset colon cancer and rectal cancer. Future studies could aim to identify lifestyle, dietary, and environmental factors that might contribute to these differences. By examining the microbiome composition, diet patterns, and exposure to environmental toxins, researchers could gain insights into modifiable risk factors for early-onset CRC.

Longitudinal Studies on the Progression of Synchronous Neoplasia: Conducting longitudinal studies on patients with early-onset CRC who present with synchronous neoplasia could provide valuable information on the progression of these lesions over time. This research could focus on the natural history of advanced adenomas and sessile serrated polyps in young patients, assessing the risk of progression to invasive cancer and the effectiveness of various surveillance strategies.

Comparative Studies on Treatment Outcomes and Survival Rates: Analyzing the treatment outcomes and survival rates of early-onset CRC patients with and without synchronous neoplasia could shed light on the impact of these lesions on patient prognosis. Research could compare the effectiveness of different treatment modalities (e.g., surgical resection, chemotherapy, targeted therapy) in managing early-onset CRC with synchronous lesions.

Development of Tailored Screening Guidelines for Early-Onset CRC: Based on the findings that early-onset CRC patients have a higher prevalence of advanced adenomas, research could be directed towards developing tailored screening guidelines for younger populations. This could involve determining the optimal age to begin screening in individuals at risk for early-onset CRC, as well as the most effective screening modalities (e.g., colonoscopy, non-invasive stool-based tests) for detecting synchronous lesions early.
