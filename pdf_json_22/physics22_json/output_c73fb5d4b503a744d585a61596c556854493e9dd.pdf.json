    "abstractText": "We continue our study of multipoint correlators of scalar fields on the 1d defect CFT generated by inserting operators along the Maldacena-Wilson line in N = 4 SYM. We present a weak-coupling recursion relation that captures correlators at next-to-leading order involving an arbitrary number of the elementary scalar fields \u03c6i and \u03c66, the latter being unprotected. We can then build correlators of composite operators by pinching the scalar fields together. As a demonstration of our method, we give explicit results for correlators containing up to six points. We also expand some selected correlators using recently obtained conformal blocks in the comb and snowflake channel, and check that the extracted low-lying CFT data is consistent with explicit computations.",

            "text": "Extended objects or defects are important observables in quantum field theory. They enrich the dynamics of a system by probing new physics, and are relevant in particle physics and condensed matter. A conformal defect is an extended object in conformal field theory (CFT) that preserves a fraction of the original conformal algebra. Conformal defects in higher dimensional CFTs have received significant attention in recent years, due in part to the revival of the conformal bootstrap program and its natural extension to conformal defects. In the presence of a defect, several configurations of correlation functions of local operators are possible. One can consider the local operators to either be bulk operators, i.e. they live outside of the defect, or to be excitations localized on the defect itself. In this paper, we focus on the latter and refer to this setup as correlation functions of defect operators. Such correlators are described by a (non-local) CFT in a lower-dimensional space, where the usual constraints coming from conformal invariance apply. In particular, line defects form an interesting setup, as they are the most natural way of implementing 1d conformal symmetry, and their dynamics are expected to be simpler than their higher-dimensional counterparts. This makes the study of 1d defect CFTs an ideal laboratory where new techniques can be tested. Indeed, modern developments such as analytic functionals were first formulated in 1d [1\u20133], before being generalized to higher dimensional CFTs [4]. In this work we focus on a well-known 1d model: the supersymmetric Wilson line in 4d N=4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM), defined as\nWC := 1 N trP exp \u222b C d\u03c4 (x\u0307\u00b5A\u00b5(x) + \u221a x\u0307\u00b5 x\u0307\u00b5 \u03b8 I\u03c6I(x)) , (1.1)\nwhere \u03b8I (I = 1, . . . , 6) is a SO(6) vector parametrizing a path on S5. The coupling is such that from a 10d perspective the path C is light-like: x\u0307M = {x\u0307\u00b5, \u03b8i \u221a x\u0307\u00b5 x\u0307\u00b5} with x\u0307M x\u0307M = 0. This operator is locally half-BPS and conformally invariant, and the supersymmetry enhances its total symmetry to a powerful superconformal algebra. For special geometries of the path C, such as the infinite straight line, the expectation value of this operator was obtained at all orders by summing up Feynman diagrams [5, 6]; a result which was\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nlater confirmed rigorously using supersymmetric localization [7, 8]. The 1d CFT can be generated by inserting local excitations along the line, and the fact that the resulting theory is conformal, supersymmetric and embedded in N = 4 SYM places it at a crossroads where several modern techniques converge, like perturbation theory [9\u201311], integrability [12\u201316], localization [17\u201322], holography [23, 24] and the conformal bootstrap [25\u201327]. In this work we compute multipoint correlators using standard perturbative techniques. One of our motivations is the multipoint conformal bootstrap in general, and in particular, recent developments in the study of multipoint correlators in CFT [28\u201337]. Although multipoint correlators are often technically challenging, 1d CFTs offer the advantage that the number of cross-ratios is reduced and the kinematics simplifies.\nOur goal is to obtain efficient recursion relations that reproduce general n-point correlators built out of the single-trace fundamental scalars \u03c6I(\u03c4) at next-to-leading order in the couping constant \u03bb := g2N . This work is then a natural continuation of our previous paper [11], where we focused on (single-trace) protected operators formed by inserting \u03c6i(\u03c4) (i = 1, . . . , 5). In this work we extend that analysis to include unprotected operators. The most studied example is the fundamental field \u03c66 itself, which is the only scalar of length L = 1 that couples to the Wilson line for the choice \u03b8 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1). In many ways, this operator can be seen as the 1d analog of the famous Konishi operator in 4d N = 4 SYM: it is the lowest-dimensional unprotected operator at weak coupling, and it is not degenerate. Perhaps the main difference is that it flows to a \u201ctwo-particle\u201d state at strong coupling (i.e. \u2206 = 2), whereas the Konishi operator decouples in this limit. As a result, the conformal dimension of \u03c66 has been determined up to five loops at weak coupling [13] and up to four loops at strong coupling [27].\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we review the construction of the 1d defect CFT defined along the Maldacena-Wilson line and give the perturbative rules of N = 4 SYM. In section 3 we present the recursion relations for computing correlation functions of single-trace scalar operators up to next-to-leading order. We present applications of these formulae in section 4, including the computation of anomalous dimensions and higher-point correlators of protected and unprotected operators. Section 5 is dedicated to the expansion of the correlators \u3008\u3008\u03c66 . . . \u03c66 \u3009\u3009 in conformal blocks, both in the comb and snowflake channels, and to the analysis of the corresponding CFT data. Finally we review our results in section 6 and discuss possible future directions."

(2.1)\nHere we have chosen the scalar \u03c66 to be the one coupling to the line by setting \u03b8 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) in (1.1). Note that we have Wick-rotated to Euclidean space and defined the path such that the line extends in the Euclidean time direction, i.e. x\u0307\u00b5 = (0, 0, 0, 1) and |x\u0307| = 1. The straight Maldacena-Wilson line is a half-BPS operator, and its expectation value is just\n\u3008W` \u3009 = 1 . (2.2)\nOne can consider this extended operator as a defect. In Minkowski space, it corresponds to a point-like impurity in the 3d space, which evolves in time. As a consequence, if we consider the defect to be part of the vacuum, the conformal symmetry of N = 4 SYM is broken from SO(4, 2) to SO(1, 2) \u00d7 SO(3). If we restrict ourselves to operators inserted on the line (as explained in more detail in the next subsection), then the symmetry group SO(1, 2) corresponds to a 1d CFT for which the representations carry the quantum number \u2206, which is the scaling dimension of the operators. On the other hand, the subgroup SO(3) refers to rotations orthogonal to the defect, which in this 1d picture is an internal symmetry with quantum number s (spin). Because of the presence of the scalar field \u03c66 in (2.1), the defect also breaks the R-symmetry from SO(6)R to SO(5)R. This choice entails that SO(5)R corresponds to the five scalars \u03c6i (i = 1, . . . , 5) which do not couple to the line. In this setup, the full superconformal algebra psu(2, 2|4) of N = 4 SYM breaks into the N = 8 superconformal quantum mechanics algebra osp(4\u2217|4). In this work we consider correlation functions of operators in the scalar sector, which involve only the six fundamental scalar fields \u03c6I(\u03c4) (I = 1, . . . , 6) of the bulk theory. Operators are constructed by effectively inserting them inside the trace of the Wilson line and for this reason we refer to them as insertions. Moreover we consider only single-trace representations of the algebra. Details about these single-trace insertions can be found in the next subsection, where we formally introduce the correlators."

Without loss of generality we consider the \u03c4 \u2019s to be ordered i.e. \u03c41 < \u03c42 < . . . < \u03c4n. This type of correlators is illustrated in figure 1. The\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nbrackets on the left-hand side refer to correlators in the 1d defect theory, while the ones on the right-hand side correspond to correlators in the 4d bulk theory. From now on \u3008 . . . \u3009 always refers to 1d correlators, hence we drop the subscript. These correlation functions correspond to single-trace operators,1 in the sense that there is only one overall color trace in (2.3). This is different from the bulk theory case, where each operator carries its own trace. This property is specific to the defect theory and will be crucial later on for constructing correlators involving operators of higher R-charge. This can be done by bringing two operators close to each other, we refer to this limit as pinching, and is explained in more detail at the end of this subsection. In section 4, where we present perturbative results, we consider unit-normalized correlation functions, which are defined in the following way:\n\u3008\u3008\u03c6I1 . . . \u03c6In \u3009\u3009 := \u3008\u03c6 I1 . . . \u03c6In \u3009 \u221a nI1 . . . nIn , (2.4)\nwith nI the normalization constants related to two-point functions. Indeed this definition is chosen such that\n\u3008\u3008\u03c6I(\u03c41)\u03c6J(\u03c42) \u3009\u3009 = \u03b4IJ\n\u03c4212 , (2.5)\nwith \u03c4ij := \u03c4i \u2212 \u03c4j . Note that the (classical) scaling dimension of the fundamental scalar fields \u03c6I is \u2206 = 1 due to their origin from a 4d bulk theory, which explains the form of the propagator in (2.5), in spite of the theory being one-dimensional. The normalization constants can be obtained by computing two-point functions for the correlators (2.3). For the protected operators \u03c6i, conformal symmetry fixes their form to be\n\u3008\u03c6i(\u03c41)\u03c6j(\u03c42) \u3009 = ni \u03c4212 \u03b4ij , (2.6)\nwhich follows from the fact that the operators \u03c6i have exact conformal dimensions \u2206 = 1. The normalization constant is known to be [38, 39]\nni = 2B(\u03bb) = \u221a \u03bb 2\u03c02 I2( \u221a \u03bb) I1( \u221a \u03bb) , (2.7)\nwhere B(\u03bb) is the Bremsstrahlung function with the leading weak-coupling terms being explicitly B(\u03bb) = \u03bb16\u03c02 \u2212 \u03bb2 384\u03c02 +O(\u03bb 3).\n1In principle multi-trace operators with the same quantum numbers can also be constructed. See footnote 4 in [11] for more detail.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nFor the unprotected operator \u03c66, the non-normalized two-point function reads\n\u3008\u03c66(\u03c41)\u03c66(\u03c42) \u3009 = n6\n\u03c42\u2206612 . (2.8)\nHere the normalization constant takes the form:\nn6 = 2B(\u03bb) + \u039b(\u03bb) , (2.9)\nwhich can be understood from Feynman diagrams in the following way [12, 40]: the first term corresponds to diagrams that are common to both \u03c6i and \u03c66, while the term \u039b(\u03bb) refers to the diagrams unique to \u03c66, i.e. the diagrams where the scalar field couples directly to the Wilson line (see figure 2 for an example). Since the tree-level diagrams are the same for \u3008\u03c6i\u03c6j \u3009 and \u3008\u03c66\u03c66 \u3009, it is clear that \u039b(0) = 0. The scaling dimension of \u03c66 takes the following form from the weak coupling perspective:\n\u2206\u03c66 = 1 + \u221e\u2211 n=1 \u03bbn\u03b3 (n) \u03c66 , (2.10)\nwhere the anomalous dimensions \u03b3(n)\u03c66 are known up to order n = 5 [13]. The first correction reads\n\u03b3 (1) \u03c66 = 1 4\u03c02 . (2.11)\nAs a consequence, the operator \u03c66 requires a renormalization procedure. Expanding the two-point function at \u03bb \u223c 0, we have\n\u3008\u03c66(\u03c41)\u03c66(\u03c42) \u3009 = 1 \u03c4212\n{ 1 + \u03bb\u03b3(1)\u03c66 log 2\n\u03c4212 + . . .\n} , (2.12)\nwith \u2192 0. In order to cancel the divergence, we promote \u03c66 to its renormalized version:\n\u03c66R(\u03c4) := \u03c66(\u03c4) { 1\u2212 \u03bb\u03b3(1)\u03c66 log 2\n\u00b52 + . . .\n} , (2.13)\nwhere \u00b5 corresponds to some choice of scale. This results in a finite two-point function:\n\u3008\u03c66R(\u03c41)\u03c66R(\u03c42) \u3009 = 1 \u03c4212\n{ 1 + \u03bb\u03b3(1)\u03c66 log \u00b52\n\u03c4212 + . . .\n} . (2.14)\nThis correlation function is still conformal upon renormalization of the dilatation operator. In the rest of this work we drop the subscript since we always refer to renormalized\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\noperators. We also assume normal ordering in the correlators, such that all operators have vanishing one-point functions, as required by conformal symmetry.\nThree-point functions of generic operators Ok are also kinematically fixed by conformal symmetry and read\n\u3008\u3008O1(\u03c41)O2(\u03c42)O3(\u03c43) \u3009\u3009 = CO1O2O3\n\u03c4\u220612312 \u03c4 \u2206231 23 \u03c4 \u2206312 31\n, (2.15)\nwith \u2206ijk := \u2206i + \u2206j \u2212 \u2206k. For protected operators, an appropriate tensor with Rsymmetry indices must be inserted in (2.15) (see e.g. equation (2.9) in [11]), and it follows directly that three-point functions with an odd number of fundamental fields \u03c6i vanish since all R-symmetry indices must be contracted.\nFor higher n-point functions, conformal symmetry is not strong enough to fix the kinematical form of the correlators. Nevertheless, it constrains them to be functions of n \u2212 3 cross-ratios \u03c7i. For convenience, we now restrict ourselves to correlators of the operators \u03c6I introduced above, and we use the following factorized form:\n\u3008\u3008\u03c6I1 . . . \u03c6In \u3009\u3009 = K(\u03c41,\u2206\u03c6I1 ; . . . ; \u03c4n,\u2206\u03c6In )AI1...In(\u03c71 , . . . , \u03c7n\u22123) , (2.16)\nwhere \u03c7i are the spacetime cross-ratios. The prefactor reads\nK(\u03c41,\u2206\u03c6I1 ; . . . ; \u03c4n,\u2206\u03c6In ) = (\n\u03c432 \u03c421\u03c431 )\u22061 ( \u03c4n\u22121,n\u22122 \u03c4n,n\u22122\u03c4n,n\u22121 )\u2206n n\u22122\u220f i=1 ( \u03c4i+2,i \u03c4i+1,i\u03c4i+2,i+1 )\u2206i+1 ,\n(2.17) with \u03c4ij := \u03c4i\u2212\u03c4j as usual, while we refer to AI1...In as the reduced correlator. The spacetime cross-ratios are defined as\n\u03c7i := \u03c4i,i+1\u03c4i+2,i+3 \u03c4i,i+2\u03c4i+1,i+3 , (2.18)\nand they are positive-definite. The prefactor as well as the cross-ratios are adopted from [41],2 where they emerge naturally in the derivation of the conformal blocks in the comb channel. These expressions generalize straightforwardly to operators of higher lengths.\nTo conclude this section, we review the notion of pinching already discussed in [11]. For a given correlation function, one can bring two operators or more together in order to produce single-trace operators with a higher length. For example,\n\u3008\u3008\u03c6I1(\u03c41) . . . \u03c6In\u22121(\u03c4n\u22121)\u03c6In(\u03c4n)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 two operators of length 1 \u3009\u3009 \u03c4n\u2192\u03c4n\u22121\u2212\u2192 \u3008\u3008\u03c6I1(\u03c41) . . . \u03c6In\u22121(\u03c4n\u22121)\u03c6In(\u03c4n\u22121)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 one operator of length 2 \u3009\u3009 . (2.19)\nThis pinching technique allows to construct any single-trace scalar operator made of fundamental scalar fields from correlation functions involving operators of length L = 1. Note that this is not the case in the bulk theory, where the pinching of two single-trace operators produces a double-trace operator, since each operator carries its own trace.\n2Note that in [41] the points are ordered as \u03c41 > \u03c42 > . . . > \u03c4n.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8"

Each term can be seen as the pinching limit of a four-point function of the fundamental protected scalars \u03c6i, e.g.\n\u3008\u03c6i1\u03c6 j 1\u03c6 k 3\u03c6 l 3 \u3009 = lim(2,4)\u2192(1,3) \u3008\u03c6i1\u03c6 j 2\u03c6 k 3\u03c6 l 4 \u3009 . (4.12)\nThe recursion relations (3.2) and (3.5) can be used to efficiently compute each of these terms up to next-to-leading order. We now illustrate with an example at leading order how the pinching of the recursion relation works. In the planar limit, the four-point function consists of the following two diagrams:\n\u3008\u03c6i1\u03c6 j 2\u03c6 k 3\u03c6 l 4 \u3009LO =\ni j k l + i j k l . (4.13)\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nIn order to generate the first term of (4.11), \u3008\u03c6i1\u03c6 j 1\u03c6 k 2\u03c6 l 2 \u3009, we need to pinch (\u03c42, \u03c44)\u2192 (\u03c41, \u03c43) and then relabel \u03c43 to \u03c42. Only the second diagram in (4.13) survives this pinching, since the first one results into self-contractions, and we have\n\u3008\u03c6i1\u03c6 j 1\u03c6 k 2\u03c6 l 2 \u3009 =\nij kl = \u03b4il\u03b4jk \u03bb\n2\n64\u03c04\u03c4412 . (4.14)\nWe can repeat the same procedure for the other terms at leading order and for the nextto-leading order.4 We finally obtain\n\u3008OijS (\u03c41)O kl S (\u03c42) \u3009 = 2 ( \u03b4ik\u03b4jl + \u03b4il\u03b4jk \u2212 25\u03b4 ij\u03b4kl )\n\u03bb2\n64\u03c04\u03c4412\n( 1\u2212 \u03bb24 +O(\u03bb 2) ) . (4.15)\nIn this case there is no factor corresponding to the correction to the scaling dimension since this operator is half-BPS and hence protected (\u2206 = 2). The normalization constant is\nn OijS\n= \u03bb 2 64\u03c04 ( 1\u2212 \u03bb24 +O(\u03bb 2) ) , (4.16)\nwhich agrees with (4.3) in [11] after identifying (u1 \u00b7 u2)2 \u2192 2 ( \u03b4ik\u03b4jl + \u03b4il\u03b4jk \u2212 25\u03b4 ij\u03b4kl ) . One can proceed in a similar way for the other unprotected operators in order to read their normalization constants as well as the anomalous dimensions. For example, the two-point function of OijA can be obtained in the following way:\n\u3008OijA(\u03c41)O kl A (\u03c42) \u3009 = \u3008\u03c6i1\u03c6 j 1\u03c6 k 2\u03c6 l 2 \u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03c6i1\u03c6 j 1\u03c6 l 2\u03c6 k 2 \u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03c6 j 1\u03c6 i 1\u03c6 k 2\u03c6 l 2 \u3009+ \u3008\u03c6 j 1\u03c6 i 1\u03c6 l 2\u03c6 k 2 \u3009 . (4.17)\nNote that there are only correlators of protected operators of length L = 1 on the righthand side, but that the pinching operation generates logarithmic divergences that can be related to the anomalous dimension of the operator, as explained in equation (2.12) and below. We find that the normalization constant is\nn OijA\n= \u2212 \u03bb 2 32\u03c04 ( 1\u2212 \u03bb24 +O(\u03bb 2) ) , (4.18)\nwhile the anomalous dimension turns out to be\n\u03b3 (1) OijA = 14\u03c02 , (4.19)\nin perfect agreement with [12]. All the other operators can be treated the same way, even when they involve \u03c66. For OiA we find the normalization constant to be\nnOiA = \u2212 \u03bb\n2\n32\u03c04 ( 1\u2212 \u03bb24 6 + \u03c02 \u03c02 +O(\u03bb2) ) , (4.20)\nwhile the anomalous dimension reads\n\u03b3 (1) OiA = 38\u03c02 .

(4.23)\nFinally, for the last operator O\u00b1 we find\nnO\u00b1 = 5\u03bb2 32\u03c04 ( 1\u2212 \u03bb24\u03c02 ( \u03c02 \u2212 92(1\u00b1 \u221a 5) ) +O(\u03bb2) ) , (4.24)\nand \u03b3\n(1) O\u00b1\n= 5\u00b1 \u221a\n5 16\u03c02 . (4.25)\nAll the anomalous dimensions listed above perfectly match the results of [12] for the supersymmetric case \u03b6 = 1."

This channel consists of taking one by one the OPE of an external operator with an internal operator, as represented in figure 3.7 Four-point blocks in d= 1 have been known for a long time [42], but only recently this work was extended to higher-point functions [41]. Five-point point blocks were also derived for generic dimension d in [43]. From now on, we are going to specialize our analysis to the case where all the external operators are identical scalar fields of length L= 1. For a given R-symmetry channel, the reduced correlator of such n-point functions can be expanded in blocks in the following way:\nAI1...In = \u2211\nO1,...,On C\u03c6I1\u03c6I2O1CO1\u03c6I3O2 . . .COn\u22124\u03c6In\u22122On\u22123COn\u22123\u03c6 In\u22121\u03c6Ing\u22061,...,\u2206n\u22123(\u03c71, . . . ,\u03c7n\u22123) ,\n(5.1) 7The exception being of course the two extremities, where we have to take the OPE of two external\noperators.\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nwhere the \u2206k\u2019s refer to the scaling dimensions of the exchanged operators, and CO1O2O3 are three-point functions defined in (2.15). In the case where all the scalar fields are protected, we consider the highest-weight R-symmetry channel F0. If the operators are all unprotected, then there is only one R-symmetry channel, which is labelled A6...6. The functions g\u22061,...,\u2206n\u22123 correspond to the comb conformal blocks derived in [41] and for identical external operators \u03c6, they are defined as\ng\u22061,...,\u2206n\u22123(\u03c71, . . . ,\u03c7n\u22123) := n\u22123\u220f k=1 \u03c7\u2206kk\n\u00d7FK\n[ \u22061,\u22061+\u22062\u2212\u2206\u03c6, . . . ,\u2206n\u22124+\u2206n\u22123\u2212\u2206\u03c6,\u2206n\u22123\n2\u22061, . . . ,2\u2206n\u22123 ;\u03c71, . . . ,\u03c7n\u22123\n] , (5.2)\nwhere the function FK is a multivariable hypergeometric function defined by the following expansion:\nFK\n[ a1, b1, . . . , bk\u22121,a2\nc1, . . . , ck ; x1, . . . ,xk\n]\n= \u221e\u2211\nn1,...,nk=0 (a1)n1 (b1)n1+n2 (b2)n2+n3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7(bk\u22121)nk\u22121+nk (a2)nk (c1)n1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7(ck)nk xn11 n1! \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xnkk nk! .

Our goal here is to expand the correlators \u3008\u3008\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c6k\u03c6l \u3009\u3009 and \u3008\u3008\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 \u3009\u3009 following (5.1) and to check whether the CFT data for the exchanged operator O\u2206 with the lowest \u2206 agrees with the results computed in section 4.2.\n\u3008\u3008\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c6k\u03c6l \u3009\u3009.

According to equation (4.27), we have\nC\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c66C\u03c66\u03c6k\u03c6l = \u03bb 8\u03c02 +O(\u03bb 2) . (5.5)\nWe now expand the correlator at \u03c7\u223c 0 for the leading and next-to-leading orders, and compare the order O(\u03c7) to (5.4) and (5.5). From (4.33), we see that\nF (0) 0 (\u03c7) = 1 , (5.6)\nand this implies that C\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c66C\u03c66\u03c6k\u03c6l vanishes at O(\u03bb0) as predicted by (5.5). For the next order, we expand (4.35) to find that\nF (1) 0 (\u03c7) = 1 8\u03c02\u03c7+. . . , (5.7)\nwhich is in perfect agreement with (5.4) and (5.5).\n\u3008\u3008\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 \u3009\u3009. We focus now our attention on the four-point function of unprotected operators \u03c66. In this case, it is clear from R-charge conservation that the only operator with (bare) scaling dimension \u2206 = 1 that can appear in the exchange is the unprotected scalar \u03c66 itself, and thus the correlator \u3008\u3008\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 \u3009\u3009 is expected to contain the three-point function \u3008\u3008\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 \u3009\u3009 in its expansion. This coefficient was computed in (4.28) and can be compared to the four-point function obtained in section 4.3.2. Expanding the correlator in blocks following (5.1), we find\nA6666(\u03c7) = 1+C2\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66g1(\u03c7)+. . .\n= 1+C2\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66\u03c7+. . . , (5.8)\nwhich we compare to the results listed in section 4.3.2. From (4.45), we find that the correlator at leading order can be expanded as\nA(0)6666(\u03c7) = 1+\u03c72+. . . , (5.9)\nand thus we observe that C2\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 vanishes at O(\u03bb 0) as expected from (4.28), since there is no term of order O(\u03c7). Again the first term corresponds to the exchange of the identity operator 1 and it is 1 due to the unit-normalization of the two-point function.\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nWe are also able to derive a closed-form expression for the OPE coefficients with arbitrary \u2206:\nC\u03c66\u03c66O\u2206CO\u2206\u03c66\u03c66 |O(\u03bb0) = 4 \u221a \u03c0 (\u2206\u22121)\u0393(\u2206+1) 4\u2206 \u0393(\u2206\u2212 12) . (5.10)\nWe expect that there exist several operators corresponding to the bare scaling dimensions \u2206> 1, and thus that these coefficients are in fact averages of three-point functions. We now move to the next order and we expand the expression of the correlator in (4.47) to find\nA(1)6666(\u03c7) = 9\n8\u03c02\u03c7+. . . . (5.11)\nThis coefficient should be compared to equation (4.28), which predicts\nC2\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 = 9\u03bb 8\u03c02 +O(\u03bb 2) , (5.12)\nand thus we observe a perfect match between the OPE coefficient obtained from the fourpoint function and the three-point function computed using the recursion relation."

As in section 5.1.1, we can expand in conformal blocks the sixpoint function of protected operators studied in section 4.5.1, and compare the three-point function \u3008\u3008\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c66 \u3009\u3009 computed in (4.27) with the prediction obtained from the correlator. The comb channel for this correlator is represented in figure 6, and it is easy to see that the lowest coefficient that can be checked corresponds to setting \u22061 = \u22062 = 1, \u22063 = 0, for which the exchanged operators can only be O1 =\u03c66, O2 =\u03c6h (h= 1, . . . ,5), O3 =1, due to conservation of the R-charge. Noticing that the OPE coefficient vanishes when one \u2206 is equal to 1 and the two other \u2206\u2019s are 0, we can expand the highest-weight channel F0 in blocks in order to compare to that coefficient. We find that\nF0(\u03c71,\u03c72,\u03c73) = 1+C\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c66C\u03c66\u03c6k\u03c6hC\u03c6h\u03c6l1C1\u03c6m\u03c6n\u03c71\u03c72+. . . , (5.16)\nwhere we note that C\u03c6h\u03c6l1C1\u03c6m\u03c6n = 1, due to the unit-normalization of the two-point function.

At leading order we see from equation (4.63) that\nF (0) 0 (\u03c71,\u03c72,\u03c73) = 1 , (5.17)\nwhich matches the expectation that C\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c66C\u03c66\u03c6k\u03c6h vanishes at order O(\u03bb0), as it was the case for the four-point function as well.\nAt next-to-leading order, expanding equation (4.64) at \u03c71,\u03c72,\u03c73\u223c 0 results in\nF (1) 0 (\u03c71,\u03c72,\u03c73) = 1 8\u03c02\u03c71\u03c72+. . . , (5.18)\nwhere the coefficient of \u03c71\u03c72 is to be identified with C\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c66C\u03c66\u03c6k\u03c6h according to (5.16).

Our last expansion in the comb channel is the six-point function of unprotected operators discussed in subsection 4.5.2. This correlator is expected to contain the three-point function \u3008\u3008\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 \u3009\u3009, which can be checked against (4.28). This coefficient can be accessed e.g. by setting as (bare) scaling dimensions \u22061 = \u22062 = 1 and \u22063 = 0.

Other lower combinations such as \u22061 = 1, \u22062 = \u22063 = 0 vanish because one-point functions are zero in CFT. We now extract this coefficient at leading and next-to-leading orders and compare it to the direct computation. At leading order, expanding (4.68) at \u03c71 ,\u03c72 ,\u03c73\u223c 0 gives\nA(0)666666(\u03c71,\u03c72,\u03c73) = 1+\u03c721+. . . , (5.20)\nand thus C2\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 vanishes at order O(\u03bb 0) as predicted by (4.28).\nWe are also able to determine a closed form for the OPE coefficients at leading order:\nC\u03c66\u03c66O\u22061 CO\u22061\u03c6 6O\u22062 CO\u22062\u03c6 6O\u22063 CO\u22063\u03c6 6\u03c66 \u2223\u2223\u2223 O(\u03bb0) =\u2212 64\u03c0 3/2 4\u22061+\u22062+\u22063 \u22061(\u22061\u22121)\u220612 (2\u22061\u22121)(\u22061+\u22062\u22121)\n\u00d7 \u0393(\u22061+\u22062) 2\n\u0393(\u22062)\u0393(\u22061\u22121/2)2\u0393(\u22062\u22121/2) \u03b4\u22061,\u22063 ,\n(5.21)\nwith \u2206ij := \u2206i\u2212\u2206j , valid when \u22061<\u22062.

In this case, the OPE limits consist of bringing two neighbouring external operators close to each other pairwise, and this has for consequence that the OPE coefficient in the middle can consist of operators all different from the external ones, as opposed to the comb channel of the previous section where at least one external operator is present in the threepoint functions. As above, we specialize our analysis to the case where all the external operators are identical and are of length L= 1, i.e. correlation functions that involve either the protected fundamental scalars \u03c6i or the unprotected one \u03c66.\nIn order to take the proper OPE limits, we have to consider a new set of cross-ratios:\nz1 = \u03c412\u03c446 \u03c416\u03c424 , z2 = \u03c426\u03c434 \u03c423\u03c446 , z3 = \u03c424\u03c456 \u03c426\u03c445 .

We note that, as usual, C\u03c6I5\u03c6I61CO\u2206=1O\u2206=11 = 1 because of the unitnormalization of two-point functions.

We now consider the cases where the six-point functions are either \u3008\u3008\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c6k\u03c6l\u03c6m\u03c6n \u3009\u3009 or \u3008\u3008\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 \u3009\u3009, and perform checks for the OPE coefficients encountered in (5.28).\n\u3008\u3008\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c6k\u03c6l\u03c6m\u03c6n \u3009\u3009. We start by the correlator with the six protected fundamental scalars. As usual let us focus on the highest-weight channel F0, the expansion sketched in (5.28) then becomes\nF0(z1 ,z2 ,z3) = 1+C\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c66C\u03c66\u03c6k\u03c6lz1z2+. . . , (5.29)\nwhere the exchanged operator can only be \u03c66 because of R-charge conservation. At leading order, we have seen in equation (4.63) that\nF (0) 0 (z1 ,z2 ,z3) = 1 , (5.30)\nand thus C\u03c6i\u03c6j\u03c66C\u03c66\u03c6k\u03c6l = 0 at order O(\u03bb0), in perfect agreement with (4.27). At next-to-leading order, we can expand (4.64) at z1 ,z2 ,z3\u223c 0 to obtain\nF (1) 0 (z1 ,z2 ,z3) = 1 8\u03c02 z1z2+. . . , (5.31)\nwhich perfectly matches the order O(\u03bb) of (4.27) squared.\n\u3008\u3008\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 \u3009\u3009. Let us now perform checks on our result for the six-point function of unprotected scalars \u03c66 in the snowflake channel. In this case, equation (5.28) turns out to be\nA666666(z1 ,z2 ,z3) = 1+C2\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66z1z2+. . . , (5.32)\n8In [31] a different Taylor expansion is used with a closed-form expression for the corresponding coefficients cn1,n2,n3 .\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nwhere again the exchanged operator can only be \u03c66 because of conservation of the R-charge. At leading order we can expand (4.68) and we find\nA(0)666666(z1 ,z2 ,z3) = 1+z21z22 +. . . , (5.33)\nfrom which we can read that C2\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 = 0 at O(\u03bb 0), since there is no term of order O(z1z2). This is fully consistent with (4.28). At next-to-leading order, we can expand the correlator of the supplementary material in order to obtain A(1)666666(z1 ,z2 ,z3) =\n9 8\u03c02 z1z2+. . . , (5.34)\nwhere the prefactor perfectly matches the C2\u03c66\u03c66\u03c66 predicted by equation (4.28) at order O(\u03bb)."

            "text": "In this work we investigated correlation functions on the 1d defect CFT formed by inserting scalar operators along the half-BPS Wilson line in 4d N = 4 SYM. We derived a recursion relation that allows to compute multipoint correlators \u3008\u03c6I1 . . .\u03c6In \u3009 made out of an arbitrary number of fundamental scalar fields, up to next-to-leading order for an even number of unprotected operators \u03c66, and up to leading order when their number is odd. By pinching operators together it is possible to construct correlation functions of operators of higher length, and in particular our recursion allows us to build correlators containing arbitrary operators made out of the fundamental scalar fields. For operators of length L= 2, we checked that their anomalous dimensions are properly reproduced, and in addition we generated many correlators of fundamental scalar fields and composite operators up to six-point. This provides an interesting pool of perturbative results, which can be used to test and expand modern analytical bootstrap techniques.9 As a check of our results, and to connect with recent work on multipoint conformal blocks, we expanded \u3008\u3008\u03c6i1 . . .\u03c6in \u3009\u3009 (ik = 1, . . . ,5) and \u3008\u3008\u03c66 . . .\u03c66 \u3009\u3009 in both the comb and snowflake channels, and extracted lowlying OPE coefficients. Both our correlators and the block literature seem to be consistent with each other. There are a handful of future directions that can be further explored. In section 5 we expanded our correlators in bosonic conformal blocks. Although this allowed us to extract the OPE coefficients of the \u03c66 operator, our system does have supersymmetry, and it would be desirable to perform a full superblock analysis. A suitable superspace for correlators of half-BPS operators was originally presented in [46], and more recently, superblocks including long operators were announced in [27]. A superblock expansion would extract supersymmetric CFT data, which will help disentangle degenerate operators. Morever, multipoint superblocks might pave the way to bootstrapping multipoint correlators at strong coupling, similar to the work done for four-point functions in [25, 27]. One could\n9See for example [45], where analytical functionals for 1d theories with flavor symmetry were studied, a setup closely related to our supersymmetric Wilson line.\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nalso repeat our analysis in other superconformal setups, interesting cases include line defects in 4d N = 2 theories [47] and ABJM [48]. Another natural next step is to include more general operators in our recursion formula, like fields that transform non-trivially under transverse rotations (fermions for example). One way of including more general fundamental fields would be to upgrade our formulae for \u3008\u3008\u03c6. . .\u03c6\u3009\u3009 to correlation functions of superfields \u3008\u3008\u03a6 . . .\u03a6\u3009\u3009. A result that might be relevant for this analysis is the superfield formulation for the supersymmetric Wilson line presented in [49]. Apart from superconformal lines, line defects play a prominent role in condensed matter physics. An interesting setup is the magnetic line defect studied in [50] (see also [51]). This line defect can be defined for critical O(N) models in the -expansion as an exponential of one of the fundamental scalars. Being a model with a Lagrangian formulation makes it well-suited for perturbative calculations. A follow up of this work is to study multipoint correlators on this line defect [52]. Of particular interest are correlators of the displacement operator and the tilt, which measure the breaking of spacetime and flavor symmetry respectively, due to the presence of the line defect. Both these operators can be built out of the fundamental scalars of the O(N) models, and are studied with the techniques used in this paper.10"

Those are derived from the action of N = 4 SYM in 4d Euclidean space, which is given by (2.20). Note that we consider SU(N) as the gauge group and that we work in the large N limit. The generators obey the following commutation relation:\n[T a ,T b] = ifabcT c, (A.1)\nin which fabc are the structure constants of the su(N) Lie algebra. The generators are normalized as\ntrT aT b = \u03b4 ab\n2 . (A.2)\n10Incidentally, the fundamental \u03c6i scalar in our supersymmetric Wilson line is precisely the tilt operator. The displacement operator on the other hand is a superconformal descendant of the tilt, and cannot be written using the fundamental scalars.\n\u2013 32 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nThe generators are traceless, i.e. trT a = 0. The (contracted) product of structure constants gives fabcfabc =N(N2\u22121)\u223cN3, where the second equality holds in the large N limit. We start by two-point insertions. The only one that we actually need is the self-energy of the scalar propagator at one loop, which is given by the following expression [5, 53, 54]:\n= + + +\n=\u22122g4N\u03b4ab\u03b4ijY112. (A.3)\nThe integral Y112 is given in (C.5) and presents a logarithmic divergence. We also require only one three-point insertion, which is the vertex connecting two scalar fields and one gauge field. It is easy to obtain from the action (2.20) and it reads\ni,a 1\nj,b 2\n\u00b5,c\n3 =\u2212g4fabc\u03b4ij (\u22021\u2212\u22022)\u00b5Y123. (A.4)\nThe Y -integral is defined in (C.1a) and its analytical expression in 1d can be found in (C.3). Another relevant vertex is the four-scalars coupling. Similarly to the three-vertex, it is straightforward to read the corresponding Feynman rule from the action and perform the Wick contractions in order to get\ni,a 1\nj,b 2\nk,c 3\nl,d 4\n=\u2212g6 { fabef cde (\u03b4ik\u03b4jl\u2212\u03b4il\u03b4jk)+facef bde (\u03b4ij\u03b4kl\u2212\u03b4il\u03b4jk)\n+fadef bce (\u03b4ij\u03b4kl\u2212\u03b4ik\u03b4jl) } X1234.

(A.6)\nwith Iij the propagator function defined in (2.22) and Fij,kl as defined in (C.1d). An analytical expression for Fij,kl in terms of X- and Y -integrals is given in (C.4)."

            "text": "In this appendix we give the formal expression for the recursion relation given in equation (3.6) in a diagrammatic way. A close look at (3.6) reveals that there are two types of U -integrals that one can encounter.

This distinction\n\u2013 33 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nis made clear in the definitions of the integrals, which can be found in appendix C.2.2.

It is easy to check visually which terms contain a U (2):\nt t t t t\nj k l m\nm=l+2 \u2283 t t t t\nj k l\nt t t t t\nl m j k\nm=l+2 \u2283 t t t t\nl j k\nt t t t t\nj l m k\nm=l+2 \u2283 t t t t\nj l k\nHence we only have to change the summation range for these three terms and add them by hand with an explicit mention of U (2).

This formula is the one that was effectively implemented in the supplementary material and that has been used for producing the results of section 4.\nC Integrals and regularization\nIn this appendix, we define and compute the bulk and boundary integrals that we encounter in this work.\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nC.1 Bulk integrals\nIn the computation of the Feynman diagrams at one loop, we encounter three-, four- and five-point massless Feynman integrals, which we define as follows:\nY123 := \u222b d4x4 I14I24I34 , (C.1a)\nX1234 := \u222b d4x5 I15I25I35I45 , (C.1b)\nH13,24 := \u222b d4x56 I15I35I26I46I56 , (C.1c)\nwith Iij the propagator function defined in (2.22). In the last expression we have defined d4x56 := d4x5 d4x6 for brevity. The letter assigned to each integral is evocative of the drawing of the propagators. We always encounter the H-integral in the following form:\nF13,24 := (\u22021\u2212\u22023)\u00b7(\u22022\u2212\u22024)\nI13I24 H13,24 . (C.1d)\nThe notation presented above is standard and has already been used in e.g. [54, 55]. The three- and four-point massless integrals in Euclidean space are conformal and have been solved analytically (see e.g. [56, 57] and [10, 54] for the modern notation). In 1d the X-integral is given by\nX1234 I13I24 =\u2212 18\u03c02 `(\u03c7,1) \u03c7(1\u2212\u03c7) , \u03c7 2 := \u03c4 2 12\u03c4 2 34 \u03c4213\u03c4 2 24 , (C.2)\nwith `(\u03c71,\u03c72) defined in (4.38). The Y -integral can easily be obtained from this expression by taking the following limit:\nY123 = lim x4\u2192\u221e (2\u03c0)2x24 X1234\n= I128\u03c02 ( \u03c412 \u03c423 log |\u03c413|+ \u03c412 \u03c431 log |\u03c423|+ \u03c4212 \u03c423\u03c431 log |\u03c412| ) . (C.3)\nThe H-integral seems to have no known closed form so far, but (C.1d) can fortunately be reduced to a sum of Y - and X-integrals in the following way [55]:\nF13,24 = X1234 I12I34 \u2212X1234 I14I23 + ( 1 I14 \u2212 1 I12 ) Y124+ ( 1 I23 \u2212 1 I34 ) Y234\n+ ( 1 I23 \u2212 1 I12 ) Y123+ ( 1 I14 \u2212 1 I34 ) Y134 . (C.4)\nThe integrals given above also appear in their respective pinching limits, i.e. when two external points are brought close to each other. The integrals simplify greatly in this limit, but they exhibit a logarithmic divergence which is tamed by using point-splitting regularization. For the Y -integral, we define\nY122 := lim x3\u2192x2 Y123 , lim x3\u2192x2\nI23 := 1\n(2\u03c0)2 2 .\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nInserting this in (C.3) and expanding up to order O(log 2), we obtain\n:=Y112 =Y122 =\u2212 I12 16\u03c02 ( log I12 I11 \u22122 ) . (C.5)\nThis result coincides with the expression given in e.g. [54]. For completion, we also give the pinching limit of the X- and F -integrals. The first one reads :=X1123 =\u2212\nI12I13 16\u03c02\n( log I12I13 I11I23 \u22122 ) , (C.6)\nwhich is again the same as in [54]. Finally, the pinching limit \u03c42\u2192 \u03c41 of the F -integral gives\nF13,14 =F14,13 =\u2212F13,41\n=\u2212X1134 I13I14 +Y113 I13 +Y114 I14 + ( 1 I13 + 1 I14 \u2212 2 I34 ) Y134 . (C.7)\nC.2 Boundary integrals\nIn the computations, we deal with two types of boundary integrals that we explain in detail below and that we name T - and U -integrals.\nC.2.1 T -integrals\nIn presence of the line, there is a new type of integral arising in addition to the bulk integrals of the previous appendix. We denote this integral by Tij;kl,11 and define it to be\nTij;kl := \u2202ij \u222b \u03c4l \u03c4k d\u03c4m (ijm)Yijm , (C.8)\nwhere (ijk) encodes the change of sign due the path ordering, formally defined as\n(ijk) := sgn\u03c4ij sgn\u03c4ik sgn\u03c4jk . (C.9)\nWhen the range of integration is the entire line, the integral is easy to perform and results in\nTij;(\u2212\u221e)(+\u221e) =\u2212 Iij 12 . (C.10)\nIn the case where (i, j) = (k, l) it gives\nTij;ij = Iij 12 . (C.11)\nLet us now review some relations satisfied by the T -integrals. The following identity can be used in order to \u201cswap\u201d the limits of integration:\nTjk;il|i<j<k<l =\u2212 Ijk 12 \u2212Tjk;li , (C.12)\n11This class of integrals also appears in [10], where they are defined slightly differently and labelled as Bij;kl.\n\u2013 37 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nwhere the integration range (li) on the right-hand side has to be understood as the union of segments (l,+\u221e)\u222a(\u2212\u221e, i). There also exist another relevant combination for the computations at one loop relating the T - and Y -integrals:\nIikTjk;ki+IjkTik;jk =\u2212 IikIjk\n12 +IikIjk ( 1 Iik + 1 Ijk \u2212 2 Iij ) Yijk . (C.13)\nIn general the integrals can be performed explicitly for the different possible orderings of the \u03c4 \u2019s, and here we give the results assuming \u03c41<\u03c42<\u03c43<\u03c44:\nT12;34 = 1\n32\u03c04\u03c4212\n( 4LR ( \u03c412 \u03c414 ) \u22124LR ( \u03c412 \u03c413 ) \u2212C123+C124 ) , (C.14a)\nT34;12 = 1\n32\u03c04\u03c4234\n( 4LR ( \u03c434 \u03c414 ) \u22124LR ( \u03c434 \u03c424 ) \u2212C341+C342 ) , (C.14b)\nT14;23 = 1\n32\u03c04\u03c4214\n( 4LR ( \u03c424 \u03c414 ) \u22124LR ( \u03c434 \u03c414 ) \u2212C412\u2212C143 ) , (C.14c)\nT23;41 = 1\n32\u03c04\u03c4223\n( \u22124LR ( \u03c423 \u03c413 ) \u22124LR ( \u03c423 \u03c424 ) \u2212C234\u2212C123 ) , (C.14d)\nwhere we have defined the following help function:\nCijk :=\u221232\u03c04\u03c4ij(\u03c4ik+\u03c4jk)Yijk , (C.15)\nand where the Rogers dilogarithm LR(x) is defined in (4.36). It is easy to take pinching limits of the integrals given above. For example, we can have T12;23 =\n1 32\u03c04\u03c4212\n( 4LR ( \u03c412 \u03c413 ) \u2212 2\u03c0 2 3 +C123 ) +Y112 , (C.16)\nusing the fact that LR(1) = \u03c0 2\n6 . All the other pinching limits can be performed in the same way.\nC.2.2 U-integrals\nSince the scalar \u03c66 couples directly to the Wilson line, there is another class of integral that we have to consider. We denote this integral by Ua;ij and it is defined as\nUa;ij := \u222b \u03c4j \u03c4i d\u03c4n Ian , (C.17)\nwhere a is the insertion point of the scalar \u03c66 on the Wilson line and ij indicate the range of integration. These integrals can be easily performed explicitly:\nUa;ij = 1\n4\u03c02\n( 1\n\u03c4i\u2212\u03c4a + 1 \u03c4a\u2212\u03c4j\n) , (C.18)\nwhich is valid both when \u03c4a<\u03c4i<\u03c4j and \u03c4i<\u03c4j <\u03c4a. Though, variations of this U -integral appear in the recursion, for example when \u03c4a = \u03c4i. In these cases, we just take the appropriate limit, regularizing the divergences in the integral with point-splitting regularization\n\u2013 38 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 9 8\nas for the integrals of the previous sections. If i, j=\u00b1\u221e, we again take the limit of the expression above. Given that we are interested in next-to-leading order computations, we have to consider also integrals of (C.17), that arise when two scalars \u03c66 couple to the Wilson line. We refer to these integrals as U (2)ab;ij and it is defined as\nU (2) ab;ij := \u222b \u03c4j \u03c4i d\u03c4n IanUb;nj = \u222b \u03c4j \u03c4i d\u03c4nIan \u222b \u03c4j \u03c4n d\u03c4mIbm .
