 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of ESG performance on other auditor decisions besides audit opinions, such as audit fees, auditor selection, audit effort, etc. This could provide more evidence on how ESG information influences auditors.

2. Investigate whether ESG performance affects audit quality and financial reporting quality over time through longitudinal studies. This could shed light on the long-term benefits of ESG engagement. 

3. Explore if ESG performance has differing effects on audit opinions across industries and countries. Comparative studies could reveal industry- or country-specific nuances.  

4. Analyze the interaction effects between ESG performance and corporate governance on audit opinions. This could provide insights into how governance mechanisms moderate ESG influence.

5. Develop experimental studies to directly test auditors' decision making when provided with manipulated ESG information. Controlled experiments can demonstrate causality more robustly.
