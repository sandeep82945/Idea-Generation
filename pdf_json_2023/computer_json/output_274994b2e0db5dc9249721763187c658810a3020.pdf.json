    "abstractText": "Optical fault injection is a type of attack vector targeting cryptographic circuits where the adversary injects faults during system operation to bypass defenses or reveal secret information. Since preventing this kind of attack is generally impractical, most known countermeasures focus on indirect (logic based) or direct detection. Indirect detection mechanisms monitor the effects of optical fault injections in a circuit, whereas direct sensors track the illumination itself. In this paper, we present a compact 1.29\u03bcm\u00d71.8\u03bcm direct optical sensor implemented in 65nm CMOS technology located inside the digital logic fabric. Because it is based on standard CMOS technology, it can be implemented using standard design flow. Measurements on four dedicated chips showed high sensitivity to fault injection attacks: the sensor was 2 to 6 times more sensitive than the combinational logic it protects. As a result of the sub-Vt operation of the transistors, these sensors exhibited post-attack self-recovery ability and high reliability, with a false positive rate under PVT of less than 10\u22127.

INTRODUCTION\nCRYPTOGRAPHIC modules implemented in hardwarecan be targeted by fault injection attacks where the adversary injects faults into the system to obtain secret information from the malfunctioning device [1], [2], [3]. Some fault injection methods involve the use of optical techniques such as a high-end laser [4], [5], [6], [7]. The advantage of a focused laser beam when combined with a precision stage is that it can locally illuminate the integrated circuit (IC), which unlike other attack methods translates into the ability to inject faults at high resolution (Laser Fault Injection (LFI)).\nLFI attacks are proven to be effective in several attack scenarios. For example, a straightforward attack uses LFI to bypass the Personal Identification Number (PIN) check on a smartcard. In this scenario the laser targets the microprocessor\u2019s core at a precise time frame [7], [8]. A more complex attack involves injecting faults into a block cipher (such as AES) at a specific round during encryption and using differential fault analysis (DFA) to recover the secret key [9], [10]. These two attack scenarios require both spatial and temporal precision.\nAs photons with sufficient energy hit the depletion region\n(or doped regions near the depletion region) of a p-n junction, charge carriers are generated and are immediately torn apart by the electric field such that the electrons are shunted to the n-type side, and the holes to the p-type side. The excess electron-hole pairs forward biases the p-n junction, thus creating a photocurrent [11], [12], [13]. Fig. 1 illustrates this mechanism in the case of a simple CMOS inverter. A laser beam with sufficient energy that strikes the drain p-n junction of aMOSFET can induce a photocurrent that alters the node\u2019s voltage [14].\nA LFI can be carried out through the front, back or the sides of the silicon [15]. There are numerous countermeasures aimed at the prevention of this type of attack. Although protecting the front side is straightforward and can be done at the packaging stage (using metal mesh) or during the standard physical design (densemetal fill [16]), protecting the back is more complex. Recent studies have suggested using non-standard fabrication processes such as Through-Silicon Via (TSV) [17] (which creates cavities inside the silicon to weaken the structure, thus hindering the ability of the adversary to decapsulate and thin out the die) and Backside Buried Metal (BBM) [18], [19], [20] (which is a kind of Cu\nVOLUME 11, 2023 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

To date, the most typical LFI approach is via the back, since it is the hardest to protect. Although mechanical protection methods can help, they are less attractive because they require non-standard fabrication.\nA different (and orthogonal) approach is the detection of a LFI. The failure can be detected in real time or after the fault has manifested itself as an error in the computation. In general, detection-based countermeasures can be divided into two types with respect to the logic they protect: Indirect and Direct detectors. Indirect detectors detect the faults or errors in the circuit under protection. These detectors can be implemented at the algorithm level and all the way down to the circuit level. Online algorithm-level detectors utilize redundant hardware either to infect the circuit\u2019s output in the presence of a fault, or to detect an erroneous input and/or output to the circuit [21], [22]. In the latter case, checkers for linear and non-linear error detection codes need to be implemented in hardware. In general, non-linear codes are more suitable against a sophisticated attacker. For example the robust codes in [22], [23] are non-linear codes with deterministic encoding that can detect every error, whereas the codes in [24], [25], [26], [27] are codes with random encoding whose security properties depend on the entropy of the random portion.\nBulk built-in detectors [28], [29] are also indirect detectors; these are circuit-level detectors that detect abnormal currents in the bulk during fault injection and thus have the ability to detect the fault even before it manifests as an error in the computation.\nThe main drawback of these indirect detectors is that they are designed to sense a fault on the data path and thus leak information. Since the manifestation of a fault depends on the state of the logic gate under attack (Fig. 1), the adversary can monitor the response of the system to the attack (whether the alarm was raised or not), and depending on the response, probe the output of the logic gate indirectly (using Side Channel Analysis (SCA)) to acquire information [30], [31], [32]. Direct detectors can detect a LFI immediately when the laser hits them or in their vicinity. Thus, they can be implemented alongside the logic. This type of detector consists\nmainly of optical and digital sensors [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. By nature, they generally provide lower coverage than indirect detectors. However, because they are implemented independently of the system, they do not leak information on the data path. In addition, they can be easily ported between systems, without much design overhead or reliability issues. In [33] the authors described both direct and indirect detectors, where the indirect detectors were intended mainly for other types of fault injection (such as undervoltage attacks), and the direct detectors (noted as Laser Detection Circuit (LDC)) were designed for the detection of LFI. The LDC units were built from six standard-cell inverters, a NOR and a NAND, to collect the charge created by the laser and amplify the resulting pulse. Another approach consists of creating new standard library cells that incorporate the detectors. In [34] the authors suggested incorporating reverse-biased transistors (which act as photodiodes) inside the logic cells to protect against Laser Voltage Probing (LVP), a kind of laser attack that requires less laser energy and thus more sensitive sensors. In this paper we present a novel sensor dubbed \"4tOS\" (short for 4-Transistor Optical Sensor). This direct, compact photodiode sensor is based on a standard CMOS MOSFET that can be implemented in a standard flowwithout alteration of the standard cells or the backend. The sensor is standalone; i.e., it produces a digital alarm signal without any additional logic, and offers high sensitivity and self recovery after an attack due to its operation in the sub-Vt region. The sensor was implemented in standard 65nm CMOS technology and tested under Laser Fault Injection (LFI). The sensor\u2019s efficiency was on a par with the results of the presilicon simulation of this sensor reported in [38]. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief description of the sensor, and Section III describes the experimental setup for the measurements. Section IV presents the results of the experiments. Section V compares the proposed sensor to state-of-the-art publications, and Section VI concludes the paper."

Fig. 3 depicts the sensor operation. First, in order to reset the sensor, the SN needs to be discharged. This is achieved by assigning \u20191\u2019 (VDD) to the active-low EN signal. Since the MD transistor is an NMOS, SN is discharged to the ground, and the alarm signal ALRM is pulled HIGH. Then, EN is lowered to \u20190\u2019 (GND), SN is slightly discharged a bit below the ground (due to coupling between the gate and the drain), which in turn keeps the inverter (which consists of MP and MN transistors) gates stable. The steady-state voltage at the SN node is mainly determined by subthreshold leakages of the MD and MS transistors, which tend to discharge the node to the ground. At this stage the diode between the bulk of the MS and its Source is in reverse bias, and acts as a photodiode.\nWhen an adversary illuminates the sensor with a laser beam at a defined pulse width (PW ), the photons hit the pn junction (photodiode) between the Bulk and the Source of MS, generating a photocurrent, which in turn charges the SN. If the photocurrent is high enough, the voltage at the SN will exceed the switching threshold of the inverter, and will flip its output ALRM to low voltage (\u20190\u2019). The time elapsed between laser illumination and the flipping of the ALRM is termed the Response Time, which is calculated as 50% of the laser pulse and 50% of the falling ALRM signal.\nWhen the sensor is enabled (EN is pulled LOW), MD and MS conduct in the sub-threshold region. Because of this low conduction, the SN is close to floating, so that the sensor presents high sensitivity with a fast response time compared to a standard CMOS logic gate. In a regular CMOS gate such as an inverter (Fig. 1), the induced photocurrent makes an attempt to discharge the drain node through the NMOS\u2019 bulk, while the open PMOS is still \"fighting\" to charge it. This explains the need for a substantial photocurrent to enable a successful attack.\nAfter the laser pulse, the SN slowly discharges throughMD and MS. This period is termed the Recovery Time tRT . During this period, the system needs to capture the alarm state. At the end of the recovery time the sensor returns to an enabled\nFIGURE 4. At the left (\u03b1) shows a microscope photo of the chip.

The recovery time is expressed as 50% of the falling ALRM signal and 50% of its rising. As described above, the 4tOS is a direct sensor that monitors optical illumination by using the MOSFET as a photodiode. The novelty of this sensor lies in its sensitivity (resulting from its sub-Vt operation), size, reliability and ability to be easily implemented inside the logic fabric without impacting the reliability of the logic or requiring a non-standard design flow. Section V compares the 4tOS to other state-of-the-art sensors (both direct and indirect)."

The laser wavelength was 1064nm. At 1064nm the silicon is partly transparent to the laser beam, which means that it lets the laser beam penetrate the back of the die while generating the electron-hole pairs.\nThe laser\u2019s spot size was set to a minimum of 0.76 \u00b5m using the largest (x50) objective to obtain the maximum power concentration. This is also an adversary\u2019s most likely configuration since it provides the most accuracy.\nThe laser was set to pulsed operation, and the sensors were measured using various pulse widths PW and powers. The laser power was controlled by varying the amount of current provided to the diode. The manufacturer\u2019s specifications state that the relationship between the optical power and the laser current during a typical operation of a 100 ns pulse width is about half, as can be seen in Fig. 7. The setup parameters are summarized in Table I.\nThe pulse frequency was set at 10KHz so that the time period (delta) between the pulses would be longer than the recovery time (shown in Section IV-B). Each sensor wasmea-\nsured about 65K times for the sensing probability analysis, each time at various pulse widths (from 5ns to 100ns) and various laser currents (up to 400mA for the sensors, and up to 1400mA for the combinational logic)."

The probability of sensing LFI for a given laser current was evaluated on the asynchronous sensors.\nFig. 9 shows the probability that a single sensor (sensor 2 of chip D) could sense (for a minimum spot size of 0.76\u00b5m) pulses of widths ranging from 5ns to 100ns as a function of the laser current. It is clear from the figure that wider pulses were detected with higher probability. Moreover, the sensor reliably sensed LFI at a low laser current of about 300mA for all pulse widths, which was expected due to the nature of the sensor.\nHowever, the absolute sensitivity in and of itself is not sufficient for evaluating the sensor\u2019s effectiveness; instead,\nit needs to be compared to the sensitivity of the logic it aims to protect. This sensitivity is referred to as the Relative Sensitivity RS. To achieve high sensing reliability, the sensor must be triggered at a lower laser current than the logic it is trying to protect. Here, to measure the sensitivity of the logic, a combinational block was targeted with the same laser parameters and was routed to the same asynchronous IO as used by the sensor. The reference block we chose consisted mainly of MUX and buffers since they provide a good example of CMOS logic. Fig. 10 shows the response of the combinational logic to the laser pulse. The top plot shows the response at the output for a typical laser pulse with a width of PW = 100ns and a laser current of I = 1400mA. The bottom plot shows the probability of flipping the output of the combinational block for different laser pulses at increasing laser currents. The measurements were made on Chip A. The results were similar on different chips and showed that the minimum laser current needed to cause a temporal bit-flip was around 600mA to 800mA at a laser pulse of 100ns, whereas short pulses of 5ns and 10ns did not impact the combinational logic in this power range. Moreover, the flip duration was dramatically shorter than tRT , ranging from 20ns to 30ns. In general, the number of bit flips that will (always) be detected by an error detection code (EDC) depends on the Hamming distance between legal output combinations. Since even a single bit flip is sufficient for detection, the number of bit flips is not a factor. Hence, we defined the sensitivity ratio for detection as the ratio of the probability that the sensor would respond (detect) to the probability that at least one bit flip would occur for a given laser current (at a typical pulse width of PW = 100ns):\nPsensor(detect|I ,PW = 100ns) Plogic(bit flips occurred|I ,PW = 100ns)\nThis is a good candidate metric for the relative sensitivity; however, the results showed that the sensors and the logic responded to two distinct regions of the laser current, which made the probability ratio infinite (e.g. for a laser current of I = 150mA the sensing probability is 1 while the bit flip probability is 0). Another approach is to measure the threshold current ratio RTC ; i.e., the ratio of the minimal laser current at which a detection occurs (with a conservative probability of 1 for all\nVOLUME 11, 2023 5\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

This means that the sensors\u2019 sensitivity was 2 to 6 times higher than the CMOS logic they were protecting.\nB. RESPONSE AND RECOVERY TIME Another important metric is the response time tRSP. A short response time is critical to ensure that the sensor triggers immediately. TheALRM signal of the sensor is asynchronous. Its response is immediate when the SN node is charged by the photocurrent, such that the response time is comparable to the response time of the logic under attack. The exact response time cannot be easily measured since the signal passes through several logic gates and IO cells, but is typically in the nano-second range. Fig. 8 shows a typical tRSP \u2248 50ns including external delays.\nThe recovery time tRCV of the sensor was defined as the pulse width of ALRM . This interval needs to be long enough for the signal to be registered. When an adversary injects\ncurrent into the parasitic diode of MS and charges SN, both MD and MS will try to discharge the node. Based on the structure of the sensor, when the EN is pulled low, the SN node is \"pulled\" slightly towards 0 because of the sub-vt operation of MD andMS (Fig. 2). This produces a \"recovery\" mechanism, where after the attack, the sensor returns to the enabled state. The fact that the recovery time was determined by the subvt operation of the transistors resulted in large variations in tRCV due to inter- and intra-chip process variations. A total of 8 sensors were measured on 4 different chips using typical laser parameters (PW = 100ns, I = 200mA), and the worst case tRCV was calculated over 65K cycles. The results are shown in Table III. These results suggest that the recovery time was sufficient to safely sample the ALRM signal during an attack, since the system clock is usually fast (> 10MHz). The sub-vt operation ensured the reliability of the sensor, because it eventually discharged SN to the ground and prevented it from staying in a meta-stable state. To further study the variances in tRCV we ran a 8000-point Monte Carlo simulation on the post-layout implementation of the 4tOS. Fig. 11 shows the probability that the recovery time tRCV will be smaller than t , as depicted on the horizontal axis with additional values of tRCV . The graph indicates that the variance was fairly large mainly due to process variations that affected the sub-Vt leakage. However, while the minimum tRCV was \u223c 0.16\u00b5s, 99% of the samples were over \u223c 0.5\u00b5s and 95%were over\u223c 1\u00b5s. On the other hand, a long recovery time did not affect the operation of the sensor since it has an EN signal for reset."

SENSOR COVERAGE Since the sensors were relatively small and could easily be embedded within the design, we measured their coverage zone. The coverage zone was defined as the number of sensors that could detect a single laser pulse. This provided an estimate of the distribution needed to protect a circuit.\nTo measure the coverage of the sensors, the laser was set to the minimum spot size (0.76 \u00b5m) and a typical laser current of 200mA (for high sensing probability). The laser was fired periodically at a fixed spot (chosen randomly) inside the sensor array of chip B. By marking the sensors that detected the illumination, a coverage map was produced, as depicted in Fig. 12. It shows that six sensors responded to the laser illumination. A conservative estimate of the laser spot indicated that the maximum distance between the center of the laser beam and a sensor diode was about 1.8\u00b5m.\nD. ROBUSTNESS AND RELIABILITY To test the robustness of the sensors, several sensors were measured across different chips and a single sensor (sensor 1 of chip B) was measured across varying supply voltages. The laser pulse was set to a typical 100ns width with a 200mA current. Fig. 13 shows that the probability of detection was not affected by the supply voltage or process variations for a typical injection setup. The minimum recovery time tRCV was also not affected by the different supply voltages, but varied\nunder process variations, as was shown in Table III. Finally, we examined the reliability of the sensor in terms of false alarms Psensor(falsealarm). Multiple sensors on multiple dies were measured under various voltages and temperatures (PVTs) during normal system operation (cryptographic functions) for long periods of time. No false positives were detected. Specifically, various asynchronous sensors (Fig. 4) were measured from various chips and several asynchronous sensors were measured with a supply voltage ranging from 0.65V to 1.3V and at temperatures ranging from \u221210\u25e6C to 80\u25e6C . The typical frequency of the system clock was 30MHz, and the sensors were measured for 109 clock cycles. The results showed no false positives during this time frame, thus indicating that Psensor(falsealarm) << 10\u22127."

            "text": "Table IV presents the results of a comparison of the 4tOS to three state-of-the-art works. Much like the sensor presented in this paper, the sensors in both [33] and [34] relied on the voltage change at the transistor diffusion node caused by the photocurrent, whereas [28] was focused on sensing the current at the bulk node. However, 4tOS exploited the sub-vt operation to make the sensor compact, sensitive and endowed it with a self-recovery feature.\nWhile both the 4tOS and [33] were implemented alongside the logic and did not affect it during the design process, [28] required a special backend design for the bulk sensors, and [34] suggested a new library of std-cells that integrated the detection mechanism as part of the cell.\nTo compare the sensitivity of the sensors, we calculated the relative sensitivity as described in Section IV-A. Based on the results reported in [28], the minimum laser energy for fault injection was 4.2nJ whereas the minimum energy for detection was 1.8nJ (in the worst position), so that the relative sensitivity was about 2.33. In [33] the authors did\nVOLUME 11, 2023 7\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

In [34] the authors measured sensitivity for a practical Laser Voltage Probing (LVP) attack, and showed that the minimum laser power for detection was 7mW whereas the typical laser power for an attack was 125mW , which yielded a relative sensitivity of about 18.\nThe response time of the 4tOS to the LFI was measured externally, that is, between the trigger of the laser pulse and the response to the alarm signal on the chip pad. This means that external delays are added to the measurement, resulting in a total response time of 50ns. In [28] the authors integrated logic inside the die to measure the response time and measured an internal response time of 2ns from the illumination to the response of the system. In [33] the authors did not report the response time, and in [34] the authors reported that the internal response time was \u223c 400\u00b5s, while the response time including external delays (additional logic) was 6ms (in this work the measurement was carried out only for the LVP attack). While it was challenging to measure the response time under uniform conditions, it can be seen that the response time of the 4tOS is in the range of tens of nanoseconds and should be comparable to the sensor of [33] (based on its structure).\nThe area of 4tOS is about 2 inverters, and is a standalone sensor, which means it produces a digital alarm signal that can then be used to trigger a response mechanism. In [28] the authors stated that the area of the backend part of the sensor is about 2.6 NAND2s (or about 5 inverters), but that there is an additional frontend part shared with several backend circuits, so that its area is not significant. In [33] a single sensing unit is a single inverter, but it is part of a larger Laser Detection Unit (LDC) which comprises six inverters, a NOR and a NAND, which eventually produces the alarm signal.\nFinally, in [34] the authors stated that the protected inverter in their library was the size of two regular inverters, and that an additional detection cell was used to obtain the response of several individual sensing cells."

            "heading": "VI. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "This paper presented a compact and standalone optical sensor against Laser Fault Injection (LFI) that can be implemented alongside the cryptographic function without altering the standard design flow. Depending on specific chip measurements, the sensor is 2 to 6 times more sensitive than the neighboring combinational logic (which is the target of LFI), and has a self-recovery feature where it returns to its ready state several microseconds after the laser hits (which is plenty of time for the system to respond). Using a sensor array, the coverage measurements achieved a minimum pitch of 1.8\u00b5m. Exhaustive testing showed a negligible probability of false positives. As was described, the main advantage of the 4tOS is the fact that it is compact, standalone, and can be implemented in a conventional CMOS process using standard design flow. However, these come at the expense of non-uniformity of the recovery time due to process variations, sensitivity and response time. Further research suggests separating the backend of the sensor (MS, see Fig. 2) and the front-end (MD, MP,MN), and connecting several back-end units to one frontend. This can potentially improve the area, coverage, and uniformity of the recovery time. As was shown, the simplicity and small size of the 4tOS make it a promising solution for LFI hardware security applications. However, future research will also evaluate the efficiency of the sensor under electromagnetic (EM) injection attacks [40], as the sensor response under both LFI and EM attacks (injected currents) should be similar."
