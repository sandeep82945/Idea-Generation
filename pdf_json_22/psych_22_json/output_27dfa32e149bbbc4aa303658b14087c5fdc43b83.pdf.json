    "abstractText": "Background: Evidence is lacking for the association of the behaviors of the 24 h movement guidelines including sleep duration, physical activity, screen time, and soft drink consumption with suicidality among adolescents. Methods: Data were extracted from a national representative sample of Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) in the United States from 2011 to 2019. Binary logistic regression models with complex sampling designs were used to explore the association of the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines and soft drink consumption with suicidality. Results: The total prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt, and suicide attempt with medical treatment was higher among adolescents who did not meet all the recommendations in the 24 h movement guidelines and had a higher level of soft drink consumption. Totally, not meeting all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines was significantly associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.30\u20132.19) and suicide plan (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.34\u20132.33) compared with adolescents who meet all the recommendations. Soft drink consumption of \u22653 times/day was associated with an increased risk of suicidality including suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt, and suicide attempt with medical treatment, regardless of sex. Soft drink consumption of \u22653 times/day was significantly associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt and suicide attempt with medical treatment, regardless of whether the recommendations of physical activity, screen time, and sleep duration were met. Conclusion: Age-appropriate sleep duration, no more than 2 h of screen time per day, at least 1 h of physical activity per day as contained in the 24 h movement guidelines and less than one soft drink consumption per day are good targets to prevent involvement in suicidality. More actions for intervening in the movement and dietary behaviors among adolescents are needed to maintain physical and mental health.",

            "text": "Suicide among adolescents brings a great burden of diseases worldwide and psychological pressure to the family [1,2]. Previous reports had identified the imperative of suicide, which is the fourth leading cause of death among 15\u201329 years old worldwide and the second leading cause of death among 10\u201334 years old in the United States (U.S.) [1,3,4]. Plenty of studies have materially identified recognized risk factors of suicide among adolescents such as depression [5], acute stressful events, chronic adversity in early life, familial, and genetic factors, and so on [2,5,6]. However, a perspective on lifestyle including dietary behaviors and physical activity should also be paid enough attention in adolescents, which are the important factors for physical and mental health [7\u201310].\nNutrients 2022, 14, 1870. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14091870 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2022, 14, 1870 2 of 15\nIn 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) released some initiatives and guidelines about physical activity and set a goal to reduce physical inactivity by 15% by 2030 [11,12]. The guideline from the WHO recommends children and adolescents should do at least an average of 60 min per day of moderate to vigorous intensity, mostly aerobic, physical activity, and limit the amount of time spent being sedentary, particularly the amount of recreational screen time but without a precise threshold [12\u201314]. The Canadian 24 h movement guidelines for children and adolescents, which were released in 2016, are an integrative goal of physical activity, screen time, and sleep duration [15]. The detailed content of the 24 h movement guidelines was that an accumulation of at least 60 min per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity, uninterrupted 9\u201311 h of sleep per night for those aged 5\u201313 years and 8\u201310 h per night for those aged 14\u201317 years, and no more than 2 h per day of recreational screen time [15]. These guidelines adhere to the criteria of the WHO, specifically the threshold of sedentary behaviors, and add the recommendations of sleep duration, which agrees with the recommendations from the National Sleep Foundation [16] in children and adolescents. The integrative index could better reflect the effect of movement among children and adolescents compared with a single indicator and give us more evidence for protecting children and adolescents from adverse outcomes. The prevalence of meeting all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines reported in the previous studies is between 1.0% and 9.4% among children and adolescents [9,17\u201322]. What is more, the males and younger adolescents were reported to have a higher prevalence of meeting all the recommendations contained in the guidelines according to previous studies [9,18,20,23]. Previous studies have reported that meeting all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines are associated with obesity or being overweight [20], global cognition [22], and mental health such as internalizing and externalizing behaviors [10], impulsivity [21], psychological distress [24], depressive symptoms [25,26], and anxiety [25]. Moreover, only one study, performed by Sampasa-Kanyinga et al. using the data from the Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey [9], reported the association of the 24 h movement guidelines and suicidality including suicide ideation, and suicide attempt by sex and age among children and adolescents. However, this study did not report the overall association of meeting the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, and lack of the association of the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines and suicide plan or suicide attempt with medical treatment, which are an important index of suicidality. Soft drinks, especially the consumption of sweetened beverages, were found to be highly correlated to loneliness [27], sedentary behaviors [28], physical status such as unhealthy weight status [29,30] and early menarche [31], aggressive behaviors [32\u201334] and mental health [35\u201339], which are reported to be associated with suicidality among adolescents. Although previous studies also reported that soft drinks and sweetened drinks are directly associated with an increased risk of suicidality [32,40\u201342], most of the recent studies are from non-US and low- and middle-income countries [40\u201342]. Moreover, Solnick et al. used the national data of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) of the U.S. in 2009 to explore the associations among soft drinks, aggression, and suicidality [32]. However, this study did not examine the dose\u2013response association and the evidence for the association in the recent 10 years is limited to the U.S. More attention should be paid to the interactive association of movement and dietary behaviors with suicidality and mental health. A previous study used the data of YRBS in 2019 to explore the association of sleep duration, screen time, physical activity, and dietary behaviors (not including soft drinks) with suicidality [43]. Another study also using the data of YRBS in 2019 and latent class analysis tried to build a new variable of lifestyle including all the variables of the 24 h movement guidelines and dietary behaviors and explore their association with suicidality [44]. However, there are no studies to explore the association between soft drinks and suicidality by different recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines, namely sleep duration, screen time, physical activity, and integrative index. In addition, the interactive association of not meeting the recommendations of the\nNutrients 2022, 14, 1870 3 of 15\n24 h movement guidelines and more consumption of soft drinks with suicidality is also rarely reported. This study used the data from YRBS of the U.S. from 2011 to 2019 and aimed to (1) document the weighted prevalence of suicidality including suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt, and suicide attempt with medical treatment in total and by the level of soft drink consumption or different recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines; (2) document the prevalence of meeting all, two, or one of the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines; (3) explore the weighted association of the 24 h movement guidelines and soft drink consumption with suicidality; (4) report the association of soft drink consumption and suicidality by different recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines among adolescents of the U.S."

            "text": "The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), developed in 1990 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S., aimed to monitor health-risk behaviors during childhood and early adolescence. YRBS, which was conducted every two years with different participants, was a national school-based survey of representative samples of 9th through to 12th-grade students. Employing a three-stage cluster sample design, YRBS included public and private schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame, namely, primary sampling units (PSUs), consisted of large-sized counties or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. In the second stage of sampling, selected schools from PSUs and one or two entire classes in each chosen school and in each of the grades 9\u201312 were randomly selected in the final stage of sampling. A weight based on sex, race/ethnicity, and school grade is applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and oversampling of Black and Hispanic students. The protocol of national YRBS was approved by the institutional review board of CDC and is publicly available. A self-administered computer-scannable questionnaire with anonymity was used with the voluntary procedure and parental permission. YRBS was a repeated cross-sectional database and reflected the status of high school in the U.S. More details about YRBS can be seen at the website [45] and previously published studies about YRBS [46,47]. In consideration of data integrity (the data on physical activity began in 2011), this study included the data of five recent 10-year surveys (2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019). The sample size of the five surveys was 15,425, 13,583, 15,624, 14,765, and 13,677, respectively, and a total of 73,074 adolescents were examined eventually in this study."

            "text": "2.2.1. Soft Drink Consumption\nSoft drink consumption was measured by the question: During the past 7 days, how many times did you drink a can, bottle, or glass of soda or pop, such as Coke, Pepsi, or Sprite? (do not count diet soda or diet pop)? Response options included not drinking soda or pop during the past 7 days, drinking 1 to 3 times during the past 7 days, 4 to 6 times during the past 7 days, 1 time per day, 2 times per day, 3 times per day, 4 or more times per day. These were categorized into none, <1 time per day, 1\u20132 times per day, and 3 times or above per day in this study.\n2.2.2. The Recommendations of the 24 h Movement Guidelines\nThe recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines included physical activity, screen time, and sleep duration. Physical activity was measured by the question: During the past 7 days, how many days were you physically active for a total of at least 60 min per day? (Add up all the time you spent in any kind of physical activity that increased your heart rate and made you breathe hard some of the time). Responses were dichotomized into 7 days (every day) and lower than 7 days. Screen time was extracted from two questions: On an average school day how many hours do you (1) watch TV and (2) play video or computer games or use a computer\nNutrients 2022, 14, 1870 4 of 15\nfor something that is not schoolwork? After summing the time of the two questions, responses were dichotomized into above 2 h and 2 h or below. Sleep duration was measured by the question: On the average school night, how many hours of sleep do you get? Responses were dichotomized into adherence to the recommendations and not according to the guidelines (9\u201311 h per night for 11\u201313-year-olds; 8\u201310 h per night for 14\u201317-year-olds, or 7\u20139 h per night for those \u226518 years of age) [16,48]. Eventually, meeting the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines was assessed by two new variables: (1) meeting all the three criteria or not, and (2) meeting all the three criteria, meeting physical activity and screen time, meeting physical activity and sleep duration, meeting screen time and sleep duration, meeting physical activity only, meeting screen time only, meeting sleep duration only, and meeting none of the three criteria. The first variable was used to assess the prevalence of meeting all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines and the association with suicidality. The second variable was used to check the distribution of meeting all and part recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines."

Suicidal ideation was measured by the question: During the past 12 months, did you ever seriously consider attempting suicide? A suicide plan was measured by the question: During the past 12 months, did you ever make a plan about how you would attempt suicide? Responses for suicidal ideation and suicide plan were dichotomized into yes and no. Suicide attempt was measured by the question: During the past 12 months, how many times did you actually attempt suicide? Responses were dichotomized into none and 1 time or above. Suicide attempt with medical treatment was measured by the question: If you attempted suicide during the past 12 months, did any attempt result in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to be treated by a doctor or nurse? Responses were dichotomized into yes and no.\n2.4. Covariates 2.4.1. Demographic Factors\nThe demographic factors in this study included age, sex, race, and year of the survey. Age was categorized into 14 years old or below, 15 years old, 16 years old, 17 years old, and 18 years old or above. Race was ascertained with two questions. The first question was \u201cAre you Hispanic or Latino?\u201d and the second question was \u201cWhat is your race?\u201d. If the adolescents responded \u201cyes\u201d to the first question, they were identified as \u201cHispanic/Latino\u201d. Otherwise, the second question would be asked with the response options of \u201cWhite\u201d, \u201cBlack or African American\u201d and \u201cothers\u201d (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander). The year of the survey was used as a multinominal variable in this study.\n2.4.2. Weight Status\nAge- and sex-specific Body Mass Index (BMI) was used to determine normal or underweight, overweight or obese in this study. The participants were considered overweight when the BMI percentile was at or above the 85th percentile and obese when the BMI percentile was at or above the 95th percentile for BMI by age and sex. The program and technical documentation for calculating and discriminating weight status could be seen on the website [49] and a previous study [50].\n2.4.3. Dietary Behaviors\nDietary behaviors in this study included vegetable, fruit, milk, and breakfast consumption. The responses of vegetables and fruit were dichotomized into one or more times per day and less than one time per day. The responses to milk consumption were dichotomized into one or more glasses per day and less than one glass per day. Breakfast consumption\nNutrients 2022, 14, 1870 5 of 15\nwas categorized into daily and not daily. The question\u2019s wording and detailed responses can be seen in Table S1.\n2.4.4. Depressive Symptoms\nDepressive symptoms were measured by the question: During the past 12 months, did you ever feel so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that you stopped doing some usual activities? The responses to this question were yes or no. This question is valid for depressive symptoms according to a previous study [44]. More details of the questions and responses associated with covariates, independent variables, and dependent variables can be seen in Table S1."

A series of analyses related to complex sampling design was used to get valid point estimates and corresponding confidence intervals. The weighted prevalence of suicidality in total or by the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines and soft drink consumption was reported in this study. Pearson Chi-squared statistics with the second-order correction of the Rao\u2013Scott Chi-square test [51] were used to explore the differences in the weighted prevalence of suicidality by the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines and soft drink consumption. The p-values for the differences were computed with a Satterthwaite approximation to the distribution and with denominator degrees of freedom as recommended by Thomas and Rao [52]. The confidence intervals of weighted prevalence were estimated by the methods proposed by Korn and Graubard [53]. Venn diagrams, which could display weight percentage clearly, were used to show the distributions of meeting the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines. Binary logistic regression models with a complex sampling design were used to show the association of meeting all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines and soft drink consumption with suicidality, including suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt, and suicide attempt with medical treatment after adjusting age, sex, race, survey year, weight status, depressive symptoms, and dietary behaviors including milk, fruit, vegetable, and breakfast consumption. Simultaneously, the association between soft drink consumption and suicidality by different recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines was explored in this study. Sensitivity analysis of missing data by multiple imputations by chained equations (MICE) was used to explore the stability of the associations among soft drink consumption, 24 h movement guidelines, and suicidality [46,54]. Sensitivity analysis of the association among the 24 h movement guidelines, soft drink consumption, and suicidality by omitting weight status and depressive symptoms was also performed in consideration of its confounding effect on the association. In addition, E-values were utilized to assess the sensitivity of potential unmeasured confounding results [55]. E-values for each exposure were calculated using an online calculator (website: www.evalue-calculator.com, accessed on 6 April 2022) with reporting the estimates and limits of corresponding 95% CI [56]."

The estimates associated with the risks were slightly changed and revealed that the estimates were stable. In addition, a sensitivity analysis (Table S4) of the association among the 24 h movement guidelines, soft drink consumption, and suicidality by omitting weight status and depressive symptoms was also performed. Although the effects were enhanced and lower levels of soft drink consumption were statistically associated with increased risk of suicidality, the association of the 24 h movement guidelines and soft drink consumption with suicidality was similar to previous estimates. The E-values (Table S5) were relatively large, particularly for the association with three times per day or above of soft drink consumption. Our findings show that any unobserved confounder could be adequate to fully explain away these effect estimates and to move the CIs to null, while a weak confounder could not do so."

Although Zhu et al. [20], using data from the 2016\u20132017 National Survey of Children\u2019s Health (NSCH) of the U.S., reported a higher prevalence (9.4%) of meeting all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines, this study reported a comparable prevalence (3.1%, 95% CI: 2.8\u20133.4%) with previous studies [9,17\u201319,21,22]. Similar to most previous studies [9,18,20,23], the boys had a higher prevalence of meeting all the recommendations contained in the guidelines in this study. Despite all this, children and adolescents worldwide were reported to have a low prevalence of meeting all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines. Previous studies usually explored the association between one variable in an adolescent\u2019s lifestyle such as sedentary behaviors [57,58], screen time [59], sleep duration [60], physical activity [61], and suicidality. This study used the integrated index, namely the 24 h movement guidelines, which could reflect the movement of adolescents effectively to explore the association with suicidality. The findings in this study were consistent with a previous study from Canada [9], reporting that not meeting all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines could significantly increase the risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt only among the boys. Moreover, our study added some evidence that the associations for suicide plan and suicide attempt with medical treatment and the total estimates for the associations among adolescents. This study reported that there was no statistically significant association between meeting the 24 h movement guidelines and suicidality, regardless of suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt, and suicide attempt with medical treatment among the girls, which was somewhat consistent with a previous study [9]. Several mechanisms may explain the differences by sex. Firstly, the girls have a lower prevalence of alcohol use [62], which might mediate the associations between meeting movement guidelines and suicidality [63]. Furthermore, the girls have a lower prevalence of suicide attempt [6] and a lower prevalence of meeting the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines [9,18,20,23], which might not have enough statistical power to detect the associations."

            "text": "The proportion of consuming no soft drink being 23.5% in this study is similar to previous studies [34,40,41]. Although different cut-offs for the levels of soft drink consumption were used in previous studies, only a higher frequency of soft drink consumption, namely above one time per day was associated with increased risk of suicidality including\nNutrients 2022, 14, 1870 11 of 15\nsuicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt in the previous studies [32,40\u201342]. This study also added some new evidence for the association between high levels of soft drink consumption and suicide attempt with medical treatment. Moreover, this study also had similar conclusions that the association of soft drink consumption with suicide attempt would be not changed in the subgroup analysis of sex with a previous study [42]. What is more, a significant association, regardless of sex, was also found in other behaviors of suicidality including suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt with medical treatment. Although a previous study using the data of YRBS in 2009 reported soft drink consumption daily or above was associated with suicidality [32], this study added to the evidence of the recent 10 years for the linear dose\u2013response relationship among adolescents in the U.S. The estimated risk in this study was fully adjusted by the dietary behaviors and depressive symptoms, which were not performed in previous studies. The mechanism from soft drink consumption to suicidality could be explained by mental problems. Many previous studies have examined that soft drink consumption was associated with depressive symptoms [35\u201339], which is highly related to suicidality among adolescents. Moreover, a high-sugar diet in adolescents was highly related to neuroinflammation, depressive-like behavior [64], stress-driven, emotional and addictive behaviors [65], which might be related to suicidality. In addition, previous studies reported that soft drink consumption was related to obesity or being overweight [29,30], which might cause inflammation among depressed patients [66]. This path could also be a reason for suicidality among adolescents in consideration of the positive effect of being overweight, inflammation, and depression on suicidality [67,68]. A high-sugar diet could increase anxiety-like and depressive-like behavior [69,70], decrease cognitive performance [71], and chronic psychological stress, development of metabolic syndrome (MetS), and behavioral impairment [72] among mice. This evidence from animals could provide some mediating paths from a high-sugar diet to suicidality."

It is worth noting that a significant association between any level of soft drink consumption and suicidality was not found in the group that met all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines in this study. It might be explained that the negative effect of soft drinks could be decreased when adolescents have good habits of movement. In other groups including those not meeting all the recommendations and meeting the recommendations of sleep duration, screen time, and physical activity contained in the 24 h movement guidelines, the higher level of soft drink consumption, namely above two times per day, was significantly associated with suicidality. It is worth noting the important role of controlling the consumption of soft drinks and keeping suitable movement among adolescents."

Firstly, this study used national school-based data from representative samples of 9th through to 12th-grade students to emphasize a linear dose\u2013 response relationship between soft drink consumption and suicidality, namely suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt, and suicide attempt with medical treatment. In addition, this is the first study using YRBS to report the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines and explore their association with suicidality. Furthermore, this is also the first study to explore the association of soft drink consumption and suicidality with different recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines. Some limitations are worth mentioning in this study. Firstly, a causal relationship is not able to be confirmed given the cross-sectional design. More cohort studies are needed\nNutrients 2022, 14, 1870 12 of 15\nto explore the relationship in the future. Secondly, all the questions were self-reported, and recall bias and information bias were unavoidable. Movement variables such as sleep duration, physical activity, and screen time were not measured by wearable devices, which might lead to information bias. Thirdly, soft drinks in this study did not include energy drinks, which were not collected in YRBS, which might bring some effect on the association. Fourthly, owing to the design of YRBS focusing on schools, findings are not suitable for extending to the entire population of adolescents. Lastly, some important socioeconomic factors such as family income, occupation of parents, and dietary habits of parents were not included in this database, which could be associated with confounding factors. Although the database included some factors such as alcohol and cigarette use, it was not able to be included as the covariates owing to the limited sample size in the subgroup of girls or meeting all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines."

It is implicated that the association of soft drink consumption with suicidality was not statistically significant when adolescents meet all the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines. These findings emphasize the importance of age-appropriate sleep duration, limited screen time (\u22642 h/day), and appropriate physical activity (\u22651 h/day) contained in the 24 h movement guidelines, and less consumption of soft drinks for preventing suicidality among adolescents. Relevant departments, schools, and families should formulate corresponding measures to ensure these beneficial behaviors and prevent at-risk adolescents from adverse behaviors.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nu14091870/s1, Table S1: Question-wording and details for included variables; Table S2: Characteristics of included variables among youth risk behavior surveys by survey year (2011\u20132019); Table S3: Interactive association of soft drink consumption and the recommendations of the 24 h movement guidelines with suicidality; Table S4: Sensitivity analysis of the association among 24-h movement guidelines, soft drink consumption and suicidality by omitting weight status and depressive symptoms; Table S5: E-value analysis for the association among soft drink consumption, 24-h movement guideline, and suicidality.\nAuthor Contributions: B.-P.L.: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Writing\u2014original draft, Writing\u2014review and editing; S.-X.L.: Conceptualization, Project administration, Supervision, Writing\u2014review and editing; C.-X.J.: Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing\u2014review and editing.
