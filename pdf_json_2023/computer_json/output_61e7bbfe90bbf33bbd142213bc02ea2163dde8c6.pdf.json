            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION Space robots work under different gravity (Moon: 1/6 G, Mars: 3/8 G, and small bodies or in-orbit: micro G). Thus, it is essential to have an experimental setup that can demonstrate that the robot moves under such a lower gravity. Gravity offloading techniques for such a space robot experiment are generally divided into three types: 1) Air-floating: This method removes the effect of gravity on motion in a twodimensional plane by levitating the object on the surface using compressed air and reducing friction to as close to zero as possible [1]. By changing the tilt angle of the surface plate, arbitrary gravity can be simulated. 2) Applying a controlled external force: This technique utilizes a robot arm [2] or a tether [3] attached to the target object to externally apply the controlled forces and moments other than gravity with torque and force sensor feedback, resulting in that any different gravitational forces and external moments can be simulated for the target. In this technique, we can mimic any gravity with high accuracy, but the whole hardware system tends to be large-sized. 3) Counterweighting: In this technique, the target object is hoisted by a tether to which a counterweight is attached at the other end. A vertical upward force is applied to the centroid of the object [4]. Changing the counterweight ratio to the object\u2019s weight can simulate an arbitrary gravity environment. The third method is less accurate than the second solution because the force is not actively controlled. However, the mechanical setup and control are more straightforward.\nThis paper focuses on developing the indoor testbed, which can change the inclination angle of the field and reproduce various uneven terrains for space robotic experiments. The entire system is realized in a cost- and spacesaving manner by means of the counterweighting solution\nThis work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP23K13281.

            "text": "The developed test field consists of an outer frame, a field plate that can change its inclination along with the outer frame (see Fig. 1), and a three-dimensional (3D) targettracking mechanistic system on the outer cage. The field plate frame can accommodate four wooden top panels, which have holes at 60 mm intervals to attach any object (maximum payload capacity: 200 kg) such as steps, handholds, rocks, or sand tray, creating any artificial or natural rocky/sandy terrain assuming the in-orbit space station interior or the planetary surface. The field plate\u2019s inclination angle can easily vary by the experimenter\u2019s turning the attached hand-cranked winch that lifts the backside edge of the plate. In this testbench, the robot is hung by a cable pulled by a counterweight; the cable is fixed to the robot via a two degree-of-freedom (pitch and yaw) free rotating gimbal, which helps not to give an undesired moment to the robot.\nThe testbench has a 3D target tracking system to keep applying a vertical gravity offloading force at the moving robot\u2019s center of mass. In this system, z-position is passively adjusted by the vertically moving counterweight on the friction-less rail, and xy-position is actively tracked using\nar X\niv :2\n30 9.\n10 26\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 2\n3 O\nct 2\n02 3\nCoreXY mechanism [5], which is typically used in 3D printer nozzle\u2019s mobility. CoreXY mechanism enables the precise control of xy-position of the tracker by conveying the belts, which are driven by the two stepping motors. The tracker\u2019s necessary displacement to set the cable\u2019s tilt angle back to zero is derived as follows. Let l be the length of the cable from the robot fixture to the tracker, and \u03d5 and \u03b8 be the roll and pitch angles of the cable from the vertical state relative to the inertial frame, respectively. The cable\u2019s roll and pitch tilt angle are measured by two encoders attached to the upper gimbal through which the counterweight cable is. The amount of movement in the x- and y-axes \u2206x and \u2206y can be obtained as Eq. (1).\n\u2206x = \u2212l sin \u03b8, \u2206y = l sin\u03d5 (1)\nIn the CoreXY schematic of Fig. 1, if the two belt feeds driven by the left and right stepping motors are \u2206a and \u2206b, respectively, and these can be obtained from \u2206x and \u2206y as computed in Eq.

The control input of the stepping motors is determined by PID control. The data is logged by ROS software."

            "text": "In our developed test bench, the target tracking system keeps the counterweighting force precisely vertical along with the robot movement, which is essential to prevent the robot from getting unnecessary horizontal disturbance by the controlled force for gravity cancellation. An evaluation test was conducted to assess the performance of the system. For this test, a cart was attached instead of a robot, and a three-axis force sensor was inserted between the cable and the cart\u2019s top surface to measure the counter force\u2019s vector (see Fig. 2(a)). The cart was linearly almost 1 m pushed towards the direction of positive x and y, and the force vector and the cart velocity were recorded by the force sensor and the motion capturing system, respectively. The\ncompensation force value was set to 20 N or 40 N, and the test was conducted five times, respectively. A representative result is shown in Fig. 2. Through the total ten attempts, the average velocity of the cart was 34 mm/s (min: 25 mm/s, max: 43 mm/s). Throughout all trials, while the target moves, the angle from the vertical of the force acting on the target was kept between \u00b11.5 deg (Fig. 2(b)), which results in horizontal components of the force being less than only 0.5 N (Fig. 2(c)), which is 1.3% of the 40 N of the offloading force. Furthermore, a space exploration robot demonstration using the testbed is showcased in Fig. 3. In this demonstration, a four-limbed cliff-climbing robot, HubRobo [6] (mass: 3.0 kg), was deployed on the 45\u25e6 inclined irregular slope. The counterweight mass was determined to be 3.5 kg (robot gimbal mass (1.0 kg) + 5/6 of HubRobo mass), simulating the Lunar gravity. In practice, a certain percentage of the calculated value was added to the counterweight to offset the friction. By the accurate target tracking, we confirmed the force for gravity offloading was kept vertical (see the cable trajectory in Fig. 3) during the robot\u2019s locomotion."
