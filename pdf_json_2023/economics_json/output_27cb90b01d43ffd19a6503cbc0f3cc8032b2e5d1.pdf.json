However, the collection, curation, and interpretation of health data is often biased. This paper discusses England-wide impact of public policies to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) infections, based on the recorded per-capita infection cases between July 2020 to January 2023. The analysis presented herewith highlights the disparities across the upper local tier authorities, in the number of Covid-19 cases recorded in response to the policies. This paper further presents the correlation between the Covid-19 cases count and demographic factors, thus highlighting the key factors determining the effectiveness of the NHS policies, and therefore the need for incorporating demographic imbalance in the policy planning process. It is concluded that the upper local tier authorities comprise of three clusters of low, mid, and high prevalence of Covid-19 infections. Where the regions with high prevalence of Covid-19 cases are also the ones with higher proportions of Black/ Mixed racial groups, amongst a mid-range and low internal Migrations. Introduction Health data refers to physical or mental information about an individual collected in a digital or physical form1. Health data often contains information related to health status including future, past and current treatments, causes of deaths, among several other socio-economic parameters2, 3. Health data is key for the development of medicinal drugs, treatments, and policy-planning to control the spread of infectious diseases. Clinical treatments4, 5, facilitating the communication between the health care service sectors6, 7, and developing the cure of diseases8, 9 all rely on health data. Additionally, and as recent events have shown, collecting, and understanding data is also crucial for public decision-making10, for instance during lockdowns when to close facilities11 including schools, universities, gyms, as well as to take measures to prevent and contain novel diseases12. Health data is thus a constant factor for the whole health care sector: from establishing bridges between different services, their use for scientific research to public interest, the collection, curation, interpretation, and extrapolation of health data has modernized the medical services. Nonetheless, the collection, curation, and interpretation of health data is often biased. The bias is specifically disadvantageous to the minority sectors, making them invisible in policy-planning for the broader population. A long-standing problem and as recognised by the World Health Organization is that health data has historically been focused on \u201cprivileged people\u201d13. Since health data is used as input for the taking of decision and their impact on the population14, the development of drugs, treatments and prevention of side-effects15, the lack of data from minorities makes vulnerable sectors invisible and reinforce the gap between privileged people and population from struggling backgrounds16. There are two types of local authorities in England: county councils and district councils. Upper-tier local authorities (UTLAs) are county councils, which are responsible for services such as education, social services, highways and transport, and waste management, among others. One of the responsibilities of the UTLAs is to uphold public health, where they are responsible for providing health services, such as immunisation programs and health education. During the Covid-19 played an especially critical role in developing and implementing policies to control the spread of infections. They were particularly involved in developing and implementing local outbreak control plans, coordinating local responses, providing public health advice and support, and monitoring compliance with regulations. Covid-19 polivies in England comprised of lockdowns, social distancing measures, mask mandates, and vaccination campaigns. In March 2020, the UK government introduced a national lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This lockdown required people to stay at home except for essential purposes such as buying food and medicine or exercising. This policy was successful in reducing the spread of the virus, and in June 2020, the government began to ease restrictions. However, the All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In December 2020, the government announced that it had approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use in the UK. The vaccination campaign began shortly afterward, with priority given to the elderly, healthcare workers, and people with underlying health conditions. By April 2021, over 32 million people in the UK had received their first dose of the vaccine. In early 2021, the government introduced a tiered system of restrictions based on the prevalence of the virus in different areas. This system allowed for some businesses to reopen and for people to meet in outdoor spaces with limited numbers. However, in January 2021, a third national lockdown was introduced, with schools closed and people once again being asked to stay at home except for essential reasons. Overall, the role of upper-tier local authorities in COVID-19 policies has been to provide local leadership and coordination in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, working closely with national government and other local organizations such as the National Health Service (NHS) to control the spread of the virus and protect public health.

Maps showing various UTLA and NHS regions The COVID-19 policies implemented in England have had significant impacts on people\u2019s lives, both positive and negative. On the one hand, lockdowns and other restrictions have been successful in reducing the spread of the virus and saving lives. The vaccination campaign has also been successful in reducing the number of hospitalizations and deaths. On the other hand, the policies have had a severe impact on the economy, with many businesses forced to close or reduce their operations. The lockdowns have also had negative impacts on mental health, with many people experiencing isolation, loneliness, and depression. The closure of schools has also had a significant impact on children\u2019s education and development. The policies have also highlighted existing inequalities in society, with some groups, such as low-income families and ethnic minorities, being disproportionately affected by the virus and the policies aimed at controlling it. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of a strong social safety net and adequate support for vulnerable groups. To that end, this paper discusses England-wide impact of governmental policies to control the spread of Covid-19 infections, based on the recorded per-capita infection cases between July 2020 to January 2023 obtained from the official NHS website 1. The analysis presented herewith highlights the disparities across the upper local tier authorities of the number of per-capita cases recorded in response to the NHS policies. The disparities are highlighted by using Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) to cluster the timeseries. This paper further presents the correlation between the Covid-19 cases count and demographic factors, thus uncovering the key factors determining the effect of the NHS policies and the need for incorporating demographic imbalance in the policy planning process. This is done by using clusters obtained via using the clusters identified using SOM as targets and 1https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download 2/9 All rights reserved.

They are particularly useful for analyzing high-dimensional data, including time-series data, by projecting it onto a lowerdimensional grid. In particular, SOMs can be a powerful tool for time-series clustering that can be used to identify patterns and relationships in complex time-series data. By projecting the data onto a two-dimensional grid, SOMs can visualize and explore the underlying structure of the data and to identify groups of similar time-series data based on their patterns and characteristics.\nTo apply SOMs to time-series data, the input data is first transformed into a sequence of feature vectors, with each vector representing a different time step in the series. The SOM is then trained using these feature vectors to create a two-dimensional grid of neurons that represents the patterns in the data. During training, the SOM adjusts the weights of each neuron to represent different regions of the input space, with neurons that are close to each other in the grid representing similar input patterns.\nHere, for time-series clustering using SOMs, a modified distance measure called Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance that takes into account the temporal relationships between the feature vectors is used. DTW measures the distance between two time-series data by aligning their sequences in time and calculating the minimum distance between corresponding points.\nThe weight update equation for SOMs is modified to incorporate the temporal relationships between the feature vectors as follows:\n2https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/ datasets\n3/9\n\u2206w ji(t) = \u03b1(t)h ji(t)(x(t)\u2212w ji(t)) where \u2206w ji(t) is the change in weight for neuron j at time t, \u03b1(t) is the learning rate at time t, x(t) is the feature vector at time t, and w ji(t) is the weight vector for neuron j at time t. The function h ji(t) is the neighborhood function that determines the degree to which neighboring neurons influence the weight update of neuron j at time t.\nIn this case, 50,000 iteration was deemed sufficient as the algorithm converged after this. Figures 4 and 5 present the cluster counts and timeseries in each of the clusters. It should be noted that although majority of the cities belong to lower recorded Covid-19 infections, there are UTLAs where significantly higher instaces of Covid-19 infections are observed."

RF reduces overfitting by introducing randomness and variability in the tree building process.\nThe RF algorithm can be expressed mathematically as follows: Let T be the number of trees in the forest, and ht(x) be the prediction of tree t for input x. The prediction for the RF\nensemble is given by:\nhRF(x) = 1 T\nT\n\u2211 t=1 ht(x) (1)\nWhere hRF(x) is the prediction for input x using the RF ensemble. RF classifiers are widely used in machine learning due to their high accuracy and ability to handle large datasets with many features. They have applications in fields such as finance, medicine, and natural language processing. For the current analysis, an RF comprising 2000 decision trees using four features at once with aggregate bagging of the dataset was used. An example of a decision tree used in the current analysis is shown in Figure 6 The following metrics were used to quantify the feature importance, given the above identified timeseries clusters as targets. In other words, these numbers show the importance of each feature to classify the corresponding UTLA into the possible classes, and in turn the effectiveness of NHS policy in that area."

It measures the importance of a feature by randomly permuting its values and measuring the effect on the model performance. The permutation feature importance for categorical variables can be computed as follows:\nLet X be the categorical feature of interest and y be the target variable. The model is trained using X and y, and its performance is evaluated using a performance metric M. The permutation feature importance for X is then defined as:\nFI(X) = 1 K\nK\n\u2211 i=1 (M(X ,y)\u2212M(X\u03c0i ,y))\nwhere FI(X) is the feature importance score for X , K is the number of permutations, X\u03c0i is the feature X with its values randomly permuted in the i-th permutation, and M(X ,y) and M(X\u03c0i ,y) are the model performance scores for the original feature and the permuted feature, respectively.\nThe permutation feature importance score for X measures the effect of permuting the values of X on the model performance. A high importance score indicates that the feature is important for the model, and a low score suggests that the feature is not relevant.\n5/9\n6/9"

This is evident by clusters of timeseries observed in the recorded Covid-19 cases across various upper tier local authorities considered in this study.\nThe analysis presented herewith demonstrates that policy making should be align with theories, that generic policies are not the best way to pursue improvements and changes in the society. By taking into consideration the unique characteristics of its population, health agencies and governments can induce more case effective policies and strategies with the aim to stop the spreading of diseases."
