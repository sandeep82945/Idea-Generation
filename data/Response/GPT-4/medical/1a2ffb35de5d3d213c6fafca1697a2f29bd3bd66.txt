Comparative Analysis of Plant-derived Proteases on Different Meat Types: Investigate the effectiveness of various plant-derived proteases, such as papain, bromelain, ficin, actinidin, and zingibain, on different types of meat (e.g., beef, chicken, pork, lamb) to identify which combinations yield the most significant improvements in protein digestibility. This research could involve analyzing changes in meat texture, taste, and nutritional value post-treatment, as well as the mechanisms through which these enzymes enhance digestibility.

Role of Probiotics in Enhancing Meat Protein Digestibility in Older Adults: Conduct longitudinal human studies to evaluate the impact of specific probiotic strains on protein digestion and absorption in older adults. This research could explore how probiotics affect the gut microbiota composition and function, digestive enzyme activity, and overall protein utilization, potentially leading to dietary recommendations or probiotic supplements designed to improve protein intake and muscle synthesis in this demographic.

Development of Novel Sous Vide Protocols with Integrated Protease Treatment: Experiment with sous vide cooking methods that incorporate plant-derived proteases or probiotics into the cooking process to enhance meat protein digestibility while preserving or enhancing flavor and nutritional quality. This could include optimizing cooking temperatures, times, and enzyme concentrations to achieve the best results.

Investigation of Non-thermal Physical Methods for Protein Digestibility Improvement: Explore the potential of non-thermal physical methods like ultrasound, high pressure processing (HPP), and pulsed electric field (PEF) treatments not only for meat but also for plant-based protein sources. This research could evaluate the efficiency of these methods in breaking down protein structures to improve digestibility and bioavailability, potentially broadening the application of these technologies in the food industry.

Impact of Meat Protein Digestibility on Gut Microbiota and Health Outcomes: Conduct comprehensive studies to investigate how improving meat protein digestibility impacts the gut microbiota composition and metabolic health outcomes, such as inflammation, immune function, and disease risk. This could include examining the effects of different meat treatments on the production of beneficial or harmful metabolites by gut microbiota and their implications for health, especially in vulnerable populations like older adults.
