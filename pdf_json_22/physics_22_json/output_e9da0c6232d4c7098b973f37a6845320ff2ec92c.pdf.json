    "abstractText": "Strong quantum zero-point motion (ZPM) of light nuclei and other particles is a crucial aspect of many state-of-the-art quantum materials. However, it has only recently begun to be explored from an ab initio perspective, through several competing approximations. Here we develop a unified description of muon and light nucleus ZPM and establish the regimes of anharmonicity and positional quantum entanglement where different approximation schemes apply. Via density functional theory and path-integral molecular dynamics simulations we demonstrate that in solid nitrogen, \u03b1\u2013N2, muon ZPM is both strongly anharmonic and manybody in character, with the muon forming an extended electric-dipole polaron around a central, quantum-entangled [N2\u2013\u03bc\u2013N2]+ complex. By combining this quantitative description of quantum muon ZPM with precision muon quadrupolar level-crossing resonance experiments, we independently determine the static 14N nuclear quadrupolar coupling constant of pristine \u03b1\u2013N2 to be \u20135.36(2) MHz, a significant improvement in accuracy over the previously-accepted value of \u20135.39(5) MHz, and a validation of our unified description of light-particle ZPM. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-023-01260-7 OPEN",

Prominent examples of this include recent record high-Tc hydride superconductors4\u201310, record-density hydrogen storage materials11, metallic and solvated Li and F12,13, as well as many hydrogen-bonded materials2, e.g., water ice. Outside nuclear quantum effects, ZPM should be even more pronounced for implanted muons \u03bc+, which act as sensitive probes in muon spin relaxation (\u03bcSR) experiments14\u201316, since a muon has just 1/9 of the proton mass. We expect a large muon zero-point energy ZPE / m 1=2\u03bc 0:7 eV15,17\u201322, corresponding ZPM delocalization \u0394x / m 1=4\u03bc 0:2 \u212b around isolated muon stopping sites, the merging of candidate muon sites separated by low energy barriers, quantum tunneling, diffusion, and even muon Bloch waves23,24. Beyond these, many-body quantum effects like positional entanglement between muons and nuclei are also expected. Muon ZPM challenges the approach of predicting muon stopping sites and the lattice distortions around them using ab initio methods, often based on density functional theory (DFT)17\u201319,25, that treats the muon and nuclei as classical particles. Several schemes for approximating muon ZPM have been developed18,19, mainly divisible into: (i) adiabatic methods, based on a singleparticle description22,26\u201329, and (ii) harmonic approximations20,30,31. Studies of quantum muons using computationally more demanding, but numerically-exact, pathintegral molecular dynamics (PIMD) have remained rather sparse1,24,32, despite its popularity in describing light-nuclei systems1\u20133.\nHere we develop a unified description of muon and light nuclei ZPM and the regimes in which particular approximations apply, via a DFT+PIMD study of muon ZPM in solid nitrogen, \u03b1\u2013N2 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). We characterize the regimes by the degree of (i) anharmonicity and (ii) muon\u2013nuclear positional entanglement, the latter quantified with easy-to-calculate entanglement witnesses33\u201335. We find that in \u03b1\u2013N2 anharmonic many-body quantum effects dominate, as anticipated from previous experimental23 and theoretical work36, and discover that an extended electric-dipole polaron of polarized N2 molecules forms around a central [N2\u2013\u03bc\u2013N2]+ complex (Fig. 1b). By applying these insights to our precision muon quadrupolar level-crossing resonance (QLCR)37\u201339 experiments, we derive an independent estimate of the static nuclear quadrupolar coupling constant (NQCC) of 14N with significantly improved accuracy compared to the literature value40."

            "text": "Classical muon. Within the classical, point-particle description of muons and nuclei using DFT, we find a single stable muon site at almost exactly the (0, 1/4, 1/4) position (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b), which lies between two molecules of pristine \u03b1\u2013N2 but is not symmetric under its Pa 3 space group41,42. In line with ab initio simulations of muons36 and protons43\u201347 in N2 clusters, we find that in crystalline \u03b1\u2013N2 a muon forms an almostlinear, almost-centrosymmetric [N2\u2013\u03bc\u2013N2]+ complex oriented along the [0, 1, 1] direction. Within this complex the muon\u2019s bare positive charge+e0 is screened to just+0.46e0 by electrons covalently shared with the two nearest N2 molecules, leaving them with an electron density deficit and thus a net positive charge of +0.27e0 each (+0.04e0 on the two nearest N atoms and+0.23e0 on the two further-away ones; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2). Moreover, we find that an unusual, extended electric-dipole polaron forms around this complex, where its positive charge further induces electric dipole moments (Fig. 1c)\non other, net neutral nearby N2 molecules (Supplementary Fig. 2) and causes them to reorient to point towards the complex. Up to ~4 \u212b from the muon, dipolar electrostatic interactions of polarized N2 molecules with the [N2\u2013\u03bc\u2013N2]+ complex thus overwhelm the weak electric quadrupole and van der Waals (VdW) N2\u2013N2 interactions of pristine \u03b1\u2013N240,48.\nSingle-particle quantum approximations. To incorporate quantum effects we first employ single-particle, adiabatic approximations of muon\u2013nuclear ZPM. Though elaborate schemes have been proposed22,29, the simplest are weakly- and strongly-bound muon approximations26\u201328, corresponding to zero or maximal muon\u2013nuclear entanglement, respectively. In both schemes, an effective single-particle muon potential Veff(\u03b4x) is constructed from total DFT energy under muon displacements \u03b4x from its classical site, while: (i) keeping the nuclei fixed at the positions corresponding to the unperturbed muon site (weakly-bound case), or (ii) letting them relax by \u03b4erN\u00f0\u03b4x\u00de to new lowest-energy positions for each \u03b4x (strongly-bound case) while keeping the center of mass fixed. Respectively, this corresponds to: (i) assuming independent muon and nuclear ZPM [i.e., a separable muon\u2013nuclear wavefunction, \u03c8(\u03b4x, \u03b4rN)= \u03c8\u03bc(\u03b4x)\u03c8N(\u03b4rN)] in the weakly-bound case, or (ii) ZPM where a quantum measurement of the muon displacement \u03b4x would simultaneously also determine all nuclear displacements \u03b4rN [i.e., a maximally-entangled muon\u2013nuclear wavefunction, \u03c8\u00f0\u03b4x; \u03b4rN\u00de / \u03c8\u03bc\u00f0\u03b4x\u00de\u03b4\u00f0\u03b4rN \u03b4erN\u00f0\u03b4x\u00de\u00de, where \u03b4 is the Dirac delta function] in the strongly-bound case. Although, by the variational principle, the strongly-bound potential is shallower than the weakly-bound potential (which would tend to increase muon delocalization), the effective mass meff in the strongly-bound case increases above the free-muon mass m\u03bc due to additional movement of nuclei with the muon (which would tend to decrease muon delocalization), meaning that muon ZPM delocalization can either increase or decrease in the strongly-bound case. Explicitly, assuming a linear dependence of the displacement of the ith nucleus of mass mi on the muon displacement, i.e., \u03b4erNi\u00f0\u03b4x\u00de \u00bc Ai\u03b4x where Ai is a tensor, the effective mass tensor in the stronglybound case is given by meff \u00bc m\u03bcid\u00fe\u2211imiATi Ai where id is the identity tensor. In the weakly-bound case, meff=m\u03bc. Once Veff(\u03b4x) and meff are known, a single-particle Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the muon wavefunction \u03c8\u03bc(\u03b4x), [\u2212\u210f2/(2meff)]\u22072\u03c8\u03bc+Veff\u03c8\u03bc= (ZPE) \u03c8\u03bc, can be numerically solved to obtain the muon\u2013nuclear ZPM, encoded in \u03c8\u03bc(\u03b4x), and the corresponding ZPE . This inherently single-particle approximation with 3 degrees of freedom in \u03b4x (due to the assumed zero or maximal muon\u2013nuclear entanglement) cannot describe many-body ZPM involving more than 3 degrees of freedom (i.e., cases with partial muon\u2013nuclear entanglement).\nFigures 2a, b show the calculated weakly- and strongly-bound adiabatic effective potentials. Separable potentials are assumed with one eigenaxis, L k \u00bd0; 1; 1 , along the [N2\u2013\u03bc\u2013N2]+ complex and two, T1 k \u00bd0; 1; 1 and T2 k \u00bd0; 0; 1 , transverse to it, coinciding with muon \u0393-point normal mode directions from DFT (Fig. 2c). Table 1 lists the total muon ZPE=\u2211jZPEj with directional contribution ZPEj and muon wavefunction widths \u0394xj \u00bc \u03b4x2j\n1=2 along the j= L, T1, and T2 directions under both approximations. In the weakly-bound case, we find muon ZPM delocalization of 0.16\u20130.20 \u212b, which is significant compared to the 1.29(1) \u212b distance between the classical muon site and the nearest nitrogen. However, in the strongly-bound case we also find large directional effective muon mass renormalization meff,j/m\u03bc due to strong electrostatic interactions within the [N2\u2013\u03bc\u2013N2]+ complex and with the surrounding polaron, which leads to a large number of nitrogen nuclei following the displaced muon (up to 494m\u03bc in the complex and a further 494m\u03bc just in first shell of the polaron).

Given the discrepancy between the two adiabatic approximations, the question of their applicability arises In other words, whether muon\u2013nuclear ZPM is minimally (weakly-bound limit), maximally (strongly-bound limit), or partially entangled. We address this using a toy model with the muon bound to N= 2 nearby effective nuclei with force constants k\u03bc, which are further bound to a static lattice with force constants kn. If k\u03bc\u226a kn muon displacements barely perturb the nuclei (weakly-bound limit), while if k\u03bc\u226b kn muon displacements strongly displace nearby nuclei (strongly-bound limit). We estimate the ratio k\u03bc/kn in \u03b1\u2013N2 from the ratio of adiabatic potentials as k\u03bc;j=kn;j \u00bc Vweakeff =V strongeff 1 7, 12, and 9 along the j= L, T1, and T2 directions, respectively (Fig. 2a, b). This excludes the weakly- but not the strongly-bound adiabatic approximation. However, the relatively large ratio k\u03bc/kn still competes with the tendency of light particles to partially positionally decouple from heavier particles23, which could lead to an intermediate, partially-entangled regime where single-particle (adiabatic) approximations fail. This is tendency is expected to be further reinforced by the enhanced mass mn,j of effective nearest nuclei in the toy model needed to obtain the same calculated effective muon mass meff,j under the strongly-bound adiabatic approximation both from DFT (Table 1) and from the toy model. Namely, in the toy model we need mn;j \u00bc \u00f01\u00fe kn;j=k\u03bc;j\u00de2\u00f0meff ;j m\u03bc\u00de=N \u00bc 4:2\u00f09\u00demN, 1.7(2)mN, and 2.6(4)mN along the j= L, T1, and T2 directions, respectively, where mN is the mass of a nitrogen nucleus.\nHarmonic quantum approximations. An alternative class of approximations are harmonic methods20,30,31, which work in the many-body regime of partial entanglement, but are limited to strictly harmonic muon\u2013nuclear interactions. These start with a \u0393-point DFT phonon calculation in the classical muon site geometry (a muon is a localized defect and thus has no q-space dispersion). The usual assumption that, since muons are lighter than nuclei, muon ZPM is fully adiabatically decoupled from the lattice (yielding 3 highest-frequency normal modes \u03c9j describing single-particle muon ZPM; see Fig. 2c), corresponds to the weakly-bound (zero entanglement) adiabatic limit described above, but with the additional constraint of a harmonic adiabatic potential Veff. This assumption yields directional ZPE contributions ZPEj= \u210f\u03c9j/2 and directional ZPM delocalization\n\u0394xj \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi _=\u00f02m\u03bc\u03c9j\u00de q . The > 40% discrepancy between the harmo-\nnic and anharmonic weakly-bound adiabatic values of \u0394xL thus obtained (Table 1) hints at a breakdown of the harmonic approximation due to strong anharmonicity (Fig. 2a).\nAlthough the weakly-bound adiabatic limit is exact if m\u03bc\u2192 0, it cannot reproduce non-zero muon\u2013nuclear entanglement. In fact, in \u03b1\u2013N2 we see strong hybridization of the L muon normal mode with intra-molecular vibrations of both N2 molecules in the [N2\u2013\u03bc\u2013N2]+ complex due to a finite muon mass (Fig. 2c), which implies significant muon\u2013nuclear entanglement49,50. This is detected by projecting the top 3 (normalized) phonon normal modes onto pure muon motion, summing the squared norms of the resulting (projected) phonon eigenvectors, and subtracting the value 3, which is expected when muon normal modes do not mix with the lattice modes (i.e., in the weakly-bound limit). This\nCOMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2023) 6:142 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-023-01260-7 | www.nature.com/commsphys 3\ndefines an entanglement witness33\u201335 w1, as w1= 0 for zero muon\u2013nuclear entanglement (weakly-bound adiabatic limit) and w1 < 0 in the entangled, many-body case. For muons in \u03b1\u2013N2 we obtain w1=\u2212 0.14 < 0. This again suggests that the weakly- (and possibly also the strongly-) bound adiabatic approximation should fail, as muon\u2013nuclear ZPM is inherently many-body, at least in the harmonic approximation. Were it not for strong anharmonicity, which invalidates the approach, such complex ZPM could still be treated by the full, many-body harmonic method by considering the entire supercell \u0393-point phonon spectrum.\nFull quantum muon description. Finally, we turn to numerically-exact PIMD for calculating observables from arbitrary muon\u2013nuclear ZPM1\u20133, based on discretizing imaginarytime, T > 0 path integrals. Unlike approximate methods, PIMD works even in the anharmonic many-body regime with partial muon\u2013nuclear entanglement51. Using PIMD we find that the projected muon probability density is unimodal in \u03b1\u2013N2 (Fig. 2a, b), confirming that the muon site is unique even for quantum muons44, with no signs of quantum tunneling. Thoroughly testing PIMD convergence of observables against simplified toymodel simulations, we confirm that all observables are well converged by P= 16\u201324 PIMD beads (imaginary-time steps), except for muon ZPM delocalization \u0394xj, where we can correct for finite-P effects via a careful P\u2192\u221e extrapolation scheme (see Methods and Figs. S3 and S4). We find that muon \u0394xL is large enough (Table 1) that anharmonic effects become significant (Fig. 2a) and harmonic approximations fail. Furthermore, all \u0394xj are larger than in the weakly- and strongly-bound adiabatic approximations, implying partial muon\u2013nuclear entanglement and many-body ZPM outside of the scope of single-particle approximations, as already anticipated from L normal mode hybridization (Fig. 2c). To quantify the degree of entanglement we calculate a multivariate Pearson correlation coefficient52\nci \u00bc \u03b4x0 \u03b4r0Ni ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi j\u03b4x0j2 j\u03b4r0Nij2 q 2 \u00bd 1; 1 \u00f01\u00de\nbetween the centered muon displacement \u03b4x0 \u00bc \u03b4x \u03b4xh i and the centered displacement \u03b4r0Ni \u00bc \u03b4rNi \u03b4rNi of a nucleus i, via PIMD. The quantity w2i=\u2212 \u2223ci\u2223 \u2208 [\u22121, 0] is a witness of muon\u2013nuclear entanglement33\u201335, since w2i= 0 for separable (weakly-bound) states (as then \u03b4x0 \u03b4r0Ni\n\u00bc \u03b4x0 \u03b4r0Ni \u00bc 0), which means that w2i < 0 implies entanglement. On the other hand, in the strongly-bound case (maximal entanglement) with \u03b4erNi / \u03b4x we find \u2223ci\u2223= 100%. In \u03b1\u2013N2 the degree of muon\u2013nuclear entanglement is ci \u2248 30(4)% with the two nearest nitrogen nuclei, and decays with distance (Fig. 1c). This confirms that muon\u2013nuclear ZPM in \u03b1\u2013N2 is partially entangled and thus inherently many-body. We note that a many-body harmonic approximation calculation29,50 would yield a similar ci ( \u2248 26%) between the muon and the two nearest nitrogen nuclei.\nQLCR measurements and NQCC of \u03b1\u2013N2.

The experimental NQCC at T= 0, CQ \u00bc f \u00f00\u00deC0Q, is reduced from the static C0Q by the solid-nitrogen order parameter f(0)= 0.863(8) < 1 due to the ZPM of nitrogen nuclei40. Using DFT we calculate C0Q by assuming classical point-particle nuclei in pristine \u03b1\u2013N2, obtaining the ab initio value C0;DFTQ = \u22125.76 MHz, which differs from the accepted experimental value C0Q = \u22125.39(5) MHz by \u22486.9%, or \u22487.4 standard deviations \u03c3 (Table 2). The discrepancy arises from systematic errors in DFT calculations of EFGs, which are apparently overestimated by a factor f cal \u00bc C0;DFTQ =C0Q 1:07\u00f01\u00de. To obtain an independent estimate of C0Q \u00bc f 1calC0;DFTQ we therefore need to determine fcal, and calibrate our ab initio results against experiment.\nTo achieve this we performed precision QLCR \u03bcSR measurements on \u03b1\u2013N2. In a QLCR experiment muons stop near I \u2265 1 nuclei (here 14N), while a longitudinal magnetic field B is swept in small steps at a given T and the muon polarization Pz(t) is measured. For B where the Zeeman splitting of muon spin energy levels approaches the splitting of nuclear energy levels due to EFGs at nuclear positions, resonant cross-relaxation of muon\u2013nuclear spins occurs, resulting in a sharp dip of the measured late-time Pz(t)37\u201339. If we also have a good description of muon\u2013nuclear ZPM (e.g., via PIMD), which shifts and reshapes QLCR spectra Pz(t, B), we can extract muonatedsample EFGs and compare them to ab initio DFT predictions of them to find the sought after DFT calibration factor fcal. Since our modeling showed strongly time-window-dependent widths of QLCR spectral peaks in \u03b1\u2013N2 (Fig. 3b), we went beyond conventional integral or differential QLCR analysis39, and performed a simultaneous fit to our data over all measured B and t < 18 \u03bcs (no binning with a 16 ns time resolution), at each measured T, using a simple global model\nPz\u00f0t;B\u00de \u00bc AQPQz \u00f0t;B\u00de \u00fe AMue \u03bbMut \u00fe Abgd\u00f0B\u00de \u00f02\u00de where AQ is the amplitude of QLCR signal, PQz is the ab initiosimulated QLCR signal (for either the classical or the quantum case; see Methods) at a given fcal, which was a fit parameter (Fig. 3a, b, and Supplementary Fig. 6), while AMu describes the muonium fraction, known to form in \u03b1\u2013N248 and relaxing with rate \u03bbMu. The contribution Abgd(B) due to muons stopped outside the sample was modeled as a constant plus a weak Lorentzian of B, with fits yielding a field variation of <10% of the QLCR signal (Fig. 3c), which does not affect our conclusions. These fits described >28,000 experimental data points at each T using only 8 global fit parameters (Fig. 3c, d), with good fit quality (see\nMethods) and without systematic deviations at any t or B (Supplementary Fig. 5). This held true for both classical and quantum cases, as the main effect of muon\u2013nuclear ZPM was a simple shift of the main QLCR peak, which was absorbed into the fitted value of fcal. Extracting fcal from fits of QLCR spectra under the classical muon ansatz we thus obtain C0Q \u00bc f 1calC0;DFTQ = \u22125.22(2) MHz, which still differs from the accepted experimental value by \u22483.2\u03c3 (Table 2). However, extracting fcal from fits of QLCR spectra using a PIMD description of muon\u2013nuclear ZPM, which is well-converged without the need for finite-P extrapolation (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 3), we obtain excellent agreement with previous experiments, with the final value C0Q = \u22125.36(2) MHz (Table 2) statistically even more accurate than the previous best estimate of \u22125.39(5) MHz40."

            "text": "Based on the above analysis we are able to propose several rules of thumb for when to expect quantum muon effects, which have the potential to significantly impact the interpretation of \u03bcSR experiments. Many-body quantum muon effects are expected to be large whenever: (i) the muon is strongly (chemically) bound to the crystal lattice (see Toy model), e.g., when the material is ionic or contains very electronegative atoms, like F\u2212, Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, O2\u2212, or N3\u2212, or functional groups, like OH\u2212, that strongly attract the muon, or (ii) when the phonon normal modes of the pristine material are high-frequency, allowing them to hybridize with, typically high-frequency, muon normal modes (Fig. 2c). For example, the latter scenario is expected when the local chemical bonds in the material around the muon site are strong, e.g., ionic or strong covalent (e.g., double or triple) bonds, or when the material contains light atoms; especially if the bonds are weaker further away from the muon site, for example in molecular crystals, as discussed in the Toy model section. Under the same conditions, muon ZPE is expected to be high, which could\nCOMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2023) 6:142 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-023-01260-7 | www.nature.com/commsphys 5\nstrongly affect the energy ordering, and thus the expected occupancy, of candidate muon sites. These same conditions are also expected to lead to strong deformations of the crystal structure around the muon sites, which suggests a simple rule: if the muon strongly perturbs the crystal structure classically, it likely also becomes quantum entangled with it with a high ZPE. On the other hand, anharmonic quantum muon effects are expected to be important when: (i) the muon is highly delocalized, which occurs when it is weakly bound to neighboring atoms, e.g., at interstitial sites, or, alternatively, (ii) if the effective muon potential is inherently highly anharmonic (Fig. 2a). Muon delocalization and anharmonicity can strongly affect the interpretation of \u03bcSR results, since they directly affect the nature and strength of the coupling of the muon to the local magnetic fields. When either just many-body or anharmonic effects are present, they can be treated using appropriate harmonic or adiabatic approximations, respectively. However, as seen in the case of muons in \u03b1\u2013N2, many-body and anharmonic effects can also be present at the same time requiring their careful examination using more general quantum methods. Examples of these include numerically-exact methods like PIMD or the recently-proposed many-interacting-worlds approach54,55. We note that the discussion above is independent of the local symmetry, or any lack thereof, at the muon site.\nBeyond muons, our unified description of light-particle ZPM, where quantum regimes with well-defined approximations arise in certain limits of particle\u2013lattice entanglement and anharmonicity, directly applies also to other light particles and light-atom nuclei, e.g., hydrogen and lithium, in solids. Such an extension is of immense interest, as nuclear quantum effects were shown to play a crucial role, for example, in stabilizing recent record high-Tc hydride superconductors H3S4,56,57 and LaH105,58,59, as well as the contentious supposed room-temperature superconductors LuH3\u2212\u03b4N\u03f56,7 and CSH88\u201310,60, and in explaining their huge isotope effects, as calculated via the self-consistent harmonic approximation56,57,59. A similar situation arises in the recent record-density hydrogen storage material (CH4)3(H2)2511, which was found to be stabilized by nuclear quantum effects via the harmonic approximation, and in calculating solvation free energies of Li and F12 via the quasi-harmonic approximation. In all of these materials, a careful examination of the underlying entanglement and anharmonicity regimes of nuclear ZPM using the approaches described in this paper could reveal any possible limitations on the validity of the approximations used and provide a systematic way of finding even more accurate nuclear ZPM descriptions. In this way, our understanding of these highly intriguing quantum materials could be substantially improved.\nIn conclusion, we have performed an analysis of muon\u2013nuclear ZPM in \u03b1\u2013N2, culminating in a precision determination of the static NQCC of 14N in pristine \u03b1\u2013N2 using complementary QLCR experiments and state-of-the-art ab initio DFT+PIMD calculations, significantly improving the accuracy of this constant over the previously known value. We also discovered an electric-dipole polaron with strong effective mass renormalization around muons in \u03b1\u2013N2, which might affect the interpretation of experiments purportedly showing quantum tunneling of muonium in this material23. In fact, a similar polaron might generically be expected in molecular crystals with charged impurities. More broadly, our work demonstrates the need to consider quantum effects when interpreting \u03bcSR data, paying attention to the presence of muon\u2013nuclear entanglement and anharmonicity, to guide the choice of the applicable ZPM approximation. This unified perspective on light-particle ZPM is generally applicable and should be explored further also in the context of material science and quantum chemistry, where it promises to offer a way of finding accurate and computationally-efficient descriptions of\nnuclear quantum effects of light atoms across a wide range of quantum materials."

Calculations were carried out on a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 supercell to avoid finite-size effects around the implanted muon, while a 1200 eV planewave energy cutoff and 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 Monkhorst\u2013Pack grid63 reciprocal-space sampling was chosen to achieve numerical convergence. A neutral cell was used for pristine structure calculations, while a positive elementary charge per supercell was applied in calculations of muonated structures, to account for the positive charge of the muon. All calculations were converged to within a total energy tolerance of 0.1 neV/atom in the self-consistent field (SCF) DFT loop, while geometry relaxation tasks were converged to within a tight 5 meV \u212b\u22121 force tolerance on the muon and nuclei. Furthermore, to properly account for weak cohesive van der Waals (VdW) dispersion forces between N2 molecules, which are usually underestimated in pure DFT, a Tkatchenko\u2013Scheffler (TS) semi-empirical dispersion correction scheme was applied in a DFT-D approach64. We note, though, that the results of ordinary DFT with an ad hoc isotropic external hydrostatic pressure of 0.5 GPa (chosen to reproduce the experimental zero-pressure unit cell volume of pristine \u03b1\u2013N2) were practically indistinguishable from the results of full DFT-D calculations, even in the presence of an implanted muon. This indicates that in \u03b1\u2013N2 the dominant VdW dispersion force contribution is a simple isotropic attraction among all nuclei and the muon.\nDespite competing suggestions of a Pa 3 (No. 205) or a P213 (No. 198) cubic crystallographic structure of pristine \u03b1\u2013N2 in the literature40, we find that the higher-symmetry Pa 3 structure is moderately preferred in our DFT calculations (by ~ 0.05 eV per unit cell), in line with recent consensus41,42,65. In this structure the centers of N2 molecules form a face-centered cubic lattice (Supplementary Fig. 1a).\nClassical muon stopping site. To find candidate muon stopping sites in \u03b1\u2013N2 a muon\u2019s initial position was randomly seeded in the unit cell and the full crystal geometry (including the muon position) relaxed at a fixed, experimental cell volume until convergence. This process was repeated >20 times to generate a list of candidate muon stopping sites, which were then grouped into clusters by identifying those candidate muon sites within <0.7 \u212b of each other (or of any in-between sites) as belonging to the same cluster. Here the distance between two arbitrary candidate muon sites r\u03bc1 and r\u03bc2 was taken as the minimal possible real-space distance\nr\u03bc1 Tr\u03bc2 under any symmetry operation T in the pristine \u03b1\u2013N2 crystallographic space group Pa 3 (including discrete translational, rotational and reflection symmetries). This is because the implanted muon is the sole source of local symmetry breaking in the crystal and thus muon sites related by pristine space-group symmetry operations should be regarded as identical. A muon site cluster can thus be thought of as a connected component in a graph whose vertices are the calculated muon sites that are considered adjacent if their minimal, symmetry-reduced distance is below a chosen threshold (0.7 \u212b in our case). We note that this symmetry-aware clustering algorithm based on graph theory is also implemented in the user-friendly MuFinder program for determining and analysing muon stopping sites19,25. In the end, we find a single muon site cluster in \u03b1\u2013N2, which lies at the point midway between the centers of the two neighboring N2 molecules of the pristine \u03b1\u2013N2 structure (Supplementary Fig. 1b).\n\u0393-point phonon spectra were calculated on a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 supercell of \u03b1\u2013N2, with the whole isotope effect plot (Fig. 2c) generated from a single DFT calculation of phonon normal modes and frequencies. This was achieved by first reconstructing the dynamical matrix (DM)49,50 of the muonated crystal, reweighting it by the desired muon isotope mass m\u03bc, and then rediagonalizing it to obtain the new phonon normal modes and frequencies.\nChoice of the exchange\u2013correlation functional. We note that switching to an a priori less accurate local density approximation (LDA) DFT exchange\u2013correlation functional61 does not significantly alter our results. Namely, the classical muon\u2013nuclear distance in the [N2\u2013\u03bc\u2013N2]+ complex changes by just\u22120.01 \u212b, the total harmonic ZPE of the 3 highest-frequency (muon) normal modes changes by+4.1% compared to the PBE functional, and the harmonic (under)estimate of the entanglement coefficient ci of the muon with the two nearest nitrogen nuclei changes from \u224826% to \u224824%. The anharmonicity measure Vweakeff \u00f02\u03b4x\u00de=\u00f04Vweakeff \u00f0\u03b4x\u00de\u00de, which would equal 1 for a purely harmonic potential, at a typical displacement 2\u03b4x=+0.24 \u212b along the most anharmonic direction L (Fig. 2a) changes slightly, from 1.8 to 1.6, when switching from PBE to LDA. Many-body and anharmonic ZPM effects of muons in \u03b1\u2013N2 are thus rather robust against the choice of the exchange\u2013correlation functional. Nevertheless, we used PBE for all the results reported in the manuscript, as described above, since it is in general expected to be much more accurate than LDA for describing electronic systems, such as \u03b1\u2013N2, where electrons are not highly correlated.\n6 COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2023) 6:142 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-023-01260-7 | www.nature.com/commsphys\nClassical MD and quantum PIMD calculations. For PIMD calculations an NVT statistical ensemble of up to P= 32 beads was simulated for up to S= 8600 steps of 0.5 fs with a T= 20 K stochastic Langevin thermostat. Satisfactory convergence in bead number was achieved already for P= 16\u201324 beads for all QLCR resonance parameters (Supplementary Fig. 3) and positional observables (Supplementary\nFig. 4) except for the muon wavefunction widths (Supplementary Fig. 4a), which had to be extrapolated to the P\u2192\u221e limit (see heading Extrapolation of PIMD muon widths). Classical MD simulations (which can be interpreted as P= 1 PIMD simulations) used the same statistical ensemble, time step, temperature, and thermostat and were run for up to S= 12,000 steps. Care was taken to ensure proper thermalization of the ensembles before observables were extracted from them.\nBoth PIMD and MD simulations produce a list of SP muon\u2013nuclear\nconfigurations fr\u00f0s; p\u00dei g K\ni\u00bc1, where s= 1,\u2026, S is the time step, p= 1,\u2026, P is the bead index, and ri is the position of one muon or nucleus i out of K muons and nuclei present in the system. These muon\u2013nuclear configurations follow the corresponding Boltzmann statistical probability distribution for finding muons and nuclei at these positions. In the case of MD this is the T > 0 classical thermal probability distribution \u03c1c(r1,\u2026, rK), while in PIMD this is the quantum thermal probability distribution \u03c1q(r1,\u2026, rK), which at T= 0 would coincide with the ground-state wavefunction\u2019s \u03c8\nprobability distribution \u03c1q(r1,\u2026, rK)= \u2223\u03c8(r1,\u2026, rK)\u22232. The thermal expectation value Oh i of any observable O that depends only on muon\u2013nuclear positions can thus be approximated from numerical PIMD or MD samples by calculating the average\nOh i 1 SP \u2211 S s\u00bc1 \u2211 P p\u00bc1 O\u00f0r\u00f0s; p\u00de1 ; \u00bc ; r\u00f0s; p\u00deK \u00de \u00f03\u00de\nFor observables that were expensive to calculate [e.g., the electric field gradients (EFG), which require a full DFT calculation for each muon\u2013nuclear configuration in the above average] a further Monte Carlo approximation to the average was employed by randomly sampling only a small number of s and p (\u2248120 in the case of EFGs) in Eq. (3). For certain numerically-noisy observables, like the directional wavefunction widths in Table 1, multiple runs at a given P were merged together to improve statistics and provide a more reliable numerical estimate.\nZPM and quantum entanglement from PIMD. A numerical estimate of the average position hrii of a given muon or nucleus i can be calculated in this way by choosing O(r1,\u2026, rK)= ri in Eq. (3). From this we can estimate the squared gyration radius \u0394r2i \u00bc hj\u03b4rij2i \u00bc hjri hriij2i, which corresponds to choosing O \u00bc jri hriij2, and the covariance \u03b4ri \u03b4ri0 by choosing O \u00bc \u00f0ri hrii\u00de \u00f0ri0 hri0 i\u00de. Using these we can then extract a numerical estimate of the multivariate Pearson correlation coefficient cii0 \u00bc \u03b4ri \u03b4ri0 =\u00f0\u0394ri\u0394ri0 \u00de 2 \u00bd 1; 1 52, as in Eq. (1). If this is non-zero at T\u2192 0 it implies ground-state positional entanglement of muons or nuclei i and i0 (see Results). We can also calculate the squared ZPM delocalization of a muon \u0394x2j along a given direction j= L, T1, T2, by choosing O \u00bc j\u00f0\u03b4x \u03b4xh i\u00de v\u0302jj2, where \u03b4x is the muon displacement, for the corresponding unit vector v\u0302j along the direction j.\nExtrapolation of PIMD muon widths. While the covariance of muon\u2013nuclear positions (Supplementary Fig. 4b), the wavefunction widths of the nitrogen nuclei (Supplementary Fig. 4c), and QLCR resonance parameters (Supplementary Fig. 3) all fully converge for P= 16\u201324 beads, the muon wavefunction widths \u0394xj do not (Supplementary Fig. 4a). However, numerical estimates of expected PIMD convergence under the harmonic toy model described in the main text indicate that the muon wavefunction width is expected to be underestimated by the same factor of g \u2248 0.55(2) at P= 24 compared to the P\u2192\u221e limit in all three directions j (Supplementary Fig. 4a). This allows us to estimate the true values of \u0394xj in the P\u2192\u221e limit (Table 1) by dividing the raw PIMD values \u0394xj= 0.13, 0.15, and 0.14 \u212b along the L, T1, and T2 directions, respectively, by this factor g. Moreover, as these widths feature in the multivariate Pearson correlation coefficient ci in Eq. (1), we estimate the true values of this entanglement proxy ci in the P\u2192\u221e limit (Fig. 1c) by multiplying raw PIMD values by the same factor g.\nAs this procedure mostly neglects anharmonic effects, which are relevant along the j= L direction, we estimate the additional relative systematic uncertainty due to this omission along the direction j= L from the relative difference of \u0394xj values in the anharmonic weakly-bound adiabatic approximation and the harmonic approximation (Table 1), as a proxy for the influence of anharmonic effects. This yields an additional relative systematic uncertainty of at most \u224830% in the muon wavefunction width along the j= L direction, and \u224810% in the entanglement witness ci.\nFinally, we note the robustness of this extrapolation scheme, as even the harmonic weakly-bound adiabatic approximation (corresponding to N= 0 dynamical nuclei around the muon in the toy model), which is expected to be much less accurate than the N= 2 toy model for estimating PIMD convergence, yields a similar estimate of g \u2248 0.47(2) at P= 24.\nThermal effects and classical MD. Since PIMD calculations require a finite temperature for numerical convergence (T= 20 K in our calculations) we also checked\nthat the observed quantum effects were not masked by thermal excitations by comparing quantum PIMD calculations against complementary classical MD simulations at the same T. We find that the classical thermal spread of muon\u2013nuclear positions is indeed predicted to be much smaller than the quantum wavefunction widths (Table 1), giving just \u0394xj= 0.08 and 0.07 \u212b along j= L and T1,2, respectively, as can be expected from the steepness of the calculated adiabatic and harmonic effective potentials (Fig. 2a, b) in relation to the thermal equipartition energy kBT/2= 1.7 meV at this T, where kB is the Boltzmann constant.\nFurthermore, quantum-mechanically a transition from T-independent groundstate ZPM to thermally-excited, T-dependent quantum behavior along a given direction j upon increasing T is only expected when kBT becomes comparable to the splitting \u0394Ej between the ground-state and the first excited ZPM state. Namely, when kBT\u226a \u0394Ej the system is effectively frozen in its quantum ground state, in contrast to the classical point-particle prediction of a T-dependent spread of muon\u2013nuclear positions down to the lowest T. Under the harmonic approximation this splitting can be obtained as \u0394Ej= 2ZPEj, while \u0394Ej > 2ZPEj when anharmonicity that increases the effective potential at larger displacements is present, as, e.g., in the case of muons in \u03b1\u2013N2 along the j= L direction (Fig. 2a). From Table 1 we can see that all considered approximations point to muons in \u03b1\u2013N2 being in the low-T, kBT\u226a \u0394Ej regime along all directions j at the considered temperatures. We thus conclude that thermal effects are irrelevant for muon ZPM in \u03b1\u2013N2 at these low T, and that the muon\u2013nuclear system is, in fact, in its Tindependent quantum ground state, at least locally around the muon.\nQLCR spectra calculations. If we were to assume fixed classical muon\u2013nuclear positions frigKi\u00bc1 and the corresponding EFG tensors fVigKi\u00bc1 at those positions (these can be calculated from the muon\u2013nuclear positions using DFT), the muon and nuclear spins would interact via a Hamiltonian H composed of a Zeeman contribution HZ, a local quadrupolar contribution HQ, and a dipole coupling contribution HD37,38,66,67\nH \u00bc HZ \u00feHQ \u00feHD HZ \u00bc \u2211\ni \u03b3i_Si B\nHQ \u00bc \u2211 i e0Qi 2Si\u00f02Si 1\u00de Si ViSi\nHD \u00bc \u2211 ii0h i\n\u03bc0\u03b3i\u03b3i0 _ 2 4\u03c0jrii0 j3 Si Si0 3\u00f0Si r\u0302ii0 \u00de\u00f0r\u0302ii0 Si0 \u00de\n\u00f04\u00de\nwhere \u03b3i is the gyromagnetic ratio of muon or nucleus i with spin vector Si, spin size Si, and nuclear quadrupole moment Qi, B is the applied magnetic field, e0 is the elementary charge, \u03bc0 is vacuum permeability, the sum in HD is over unique pairs of muon or nuclei ii0h i, rii0 \u00bc ri ri0 is a vector from a muon or nucleus i0 to i, and r\u0302ii0 \u00bc rii0=jrii0 j is a unit vector in the same direction. However, due to both quantum ZPM and thermal movement the muons and nuclei described by this Hamiltonian do not have fixed classical (point-particle) positions, nor are the EFGs independent of those positions.\nTo reduce the complexity of solving the full, coupled spin\u2013positional Hamiltonian of Eq. (4), we assume that there is no significant entanglement between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom in the T \u2248 0 ground-state wavefunction of the system, i.e., that \u03c8\n\u00bc \u03c8 spin \u03c8 position , due to a separation\nof timescales for positional and spin dynamics. In this way we can construct an effective spin-only Hamiltonian operator by averaging out the positional degrees of freedom with a partial trace\nHeff ;spin \u00bc trposition \u03c1H \u00f05\u00de where \u03c1 is the total density matrix, which at T= 0 equals simply \u03c1 \u00bc \u03c8\n\u03c8 ; i.e., at T= 0 we have Heff ;spin\u00bcposition \u03c8jHj\u03c8 position. In PIMD and MD simulations this can be done numerically by calculating an average over positional degrees of freedom via Eq. (3) where the observable O is taken to be the full Hamiltonian H from Eq. (4), and at each muon\u2013nuclear configuration sample fr\u00f0s; p\u00dei g K\ni\u00bc1 we recalculate the corresponding EFG tensors Vi via DFT. As mentioned previously, due to the time complexity of calculating the EFG tensors, the full average in Eq. (3) is approximated via Monte Carlo sampling of \u2248120 random s and p indices from the PIMD or MD muon\u2013nuclear configurations fr\u00f0s; p\u00dei g K\ni\u00bc1. The numerical calculation of a single Hamiltonian sample [Eq. (4)] from the\nmuon\u2013nuclear configuration and the corresponding EFG tensors was performed using the CalcALC program68,69 by considering only the four 14N nuclei in the [N2\u2013\u03bc\u2013N2]+ complex, i.e., the four nitrogen nuclei closest to the muon, since further-away nitrogen nuclei are only very weakly dipolarly coupled to the muon and thus do not affect its relaxation much. A 14N nuclear quadrupole moment of Q= 2.044(3) fm2 was used42,53. Once the effective spin-only Hamiltonian [Eq. (5)] was thus calculated via Eq. (3), a CalcALC-inspired Python program was used to calculate the time-dependent muon relaxation signal PQz \u00f0t\u00de due to QLCR via exact diagonalization, as in Ref. 70, for a range of applied magnetic fields B. At this stage, the quadrupolar contribution HQ was multiplied by an EFG calibration factor f 1cal 1, removing most of the otherwise unavoidable systematic errors of DFT (see the Results section). In global fits of experimental QLCR spectra fcal was adjusted in a loop until convergence to a minimal \u03c72 was achieved. We note that in\nCOMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2023) 6:142 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-023-01260-7 | www.nature.com/commsphys 7\nthese fits no systematic deviations at any t or B were observed (Supplementary\nFig. 5). The total global fit quality was \u03c72/DOF= 1.06 and 1.08 at T= 1.8 and 5 K, respectively.\nThe final, calibrated QLCR spectra 1 PQz \u00f0t;B\u00de exhibit a non-trivial dependence on time t and applied field B and are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6.

QLCR \u03bcSR measurements on \u03b1\u2013N2 were performed on the EMU beamline72 (ISIS pulsed muon source), using a custom-built TiZr gas condensation cell. A 100 \u03bcm thick Ti window allowed surface muons to enter the sample volume, while a separate experiment confirmed negligible muon depolarisation in TiZr over the studied T. A 4He exchange gas cryostat around the cell provided control over sample T down to ~1.5 K, while a 1/8\u201d capillary connecting the cell to an external gas supply was heated along its length to avoid blockages. The sample was condensed from high purity (Grade 6.0) N2 gas, with \u22481.8 bar L\u22121 of gas being condensed at \u224865 K to ensure the \u22481.6 cm3 sample volume was full. Gas pressure was maintained well above the N2 triple point (\u22480.125 bar) throughout sample condensation to avoid deposition of the gas directly into the solid phase. Once condensation was complete, the sample was cooled through the freezing point at \u22480.6 K/min, with the form of \u03bcSR spectra recorded at 58 K (\u03b2\u2013N2 phase) compared to earlier data on this system48, as well as our higher-T data, to confirm the sample was frozen."
