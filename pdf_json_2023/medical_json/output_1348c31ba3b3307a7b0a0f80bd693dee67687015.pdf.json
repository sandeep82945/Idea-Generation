    "abstractText": "The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract holds a complex and dynamic population of microbial communities, which exerts a marked influence on the host physiology during homeostasis and disease conditions. Diet is considered one of the main factors in structuring the gut microbiota across a lifespan. Intestinal microbial communities play a vital role in sustaining immune and metabolic homeostasis as well as protecting against pathogens. The negatively altered gut bacterial composition has related to many inflammatory diseases and infections. \u03b2-glucans are a heterogeneous assemblage of glucose polymers with a typical structure comprising a leading chain of \u03b2-(1,4) and/or \u03b2-(1,3)-glucopyranosyl units with various branches and lengths as a side chain. \u03b2-glucans bind to specific receptors on immune cells and initiate immune responses. However, \u03b2-glucans from different sources differ in their structures, conformation, physical properties, and binding affinity to receptors. How these properties modulate biological functions in terms of molecular mechanisms is not known in many examples. This review provides a critical understanding of the structures of \u03b2-glucans and their functions for modulating the gut microbiota and immune system.",

Diet is considered one of the main factors in structuring the gut microbiota across a lifespan. Intestinal microbial communities play a vital role in sustaining immune and metabolic homeostasis as well as protecting against pathogens. The negatively altered gut bacterial composition has related to many inflammatory diseases and infections. \u03b2-glucans are a heterogeneous assemblage of glucose polymers with a typical structure comprising a leading chain of \u03b2-(1,4) and/or \u03b2-(1,3)-glucopyranosyl units with various branches and lengths as a side chain. \u03b2-glucans bind to specific receptors on immune cells and initiate immune responses. However, \u03b2-glucans from different sources differ in their structures, conformation, physical properties, and binding affinity to receptors. How these properties modulate biological functions in terms of molecular mechanisms is not known in many examples. This review provides a critical understanding of the structures of \u03b2-glucans and their functions for modulating the gut microbiota and immune system.\nKEYWORDS\n\u03b2-glucans, gut microbiota, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, immune system\n1. Introduction\nResearch of the current decade in the field of food science is paying close attention to studying microbiota and their associated health benefits (1). Diet is a critical modifiable factor and plays a crucial role in maintaining the microbiota and influencing their composition, proving the possibility of therapeutic dietary approaches to control microbial diversity, composition, and stability. The diet must also include non-digestible components, particularly dietary fibers, in addition to the necessary nutrients, including proteins, vitamins, lipids, and minerals, as diet strongly influences the composition of colonic microbiota and their metabolic products (2). \u03b2-glucans, a common component of the human diet, have several positive health effects (3, 4). Yeast, fungi (including mushrooms), certain bacteria, seaweeds, and cereals (oat and barley) contain \u03b2-glucans, and the polysaccharides of D-glucose monomers joined by \u03b2-glycosidic linkages (5, 6). \u03b2-glucans exist in different glycosidic linkages, such as \u03b2 (1,3), (1,4), and (1,6) in either an unbranched or branched arrangement (7, 8). The abundant hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds with water which gives the molecule capacity to store water in both soluble and insoluble states, making it strongly hydrophilic. \u03b2-glucans\u2019 molecular weight (MW) depends on the source and varies between 102 and 106 Da (9). High MW and high viscosity features of \u03b2-glucan cause hypocholesterolemia and hypoglycemia (10, 11). Notwithstanding, when \u03b2-glucans are used"

Foods rich in \u03b2-glucans are a significant contender for a healthy diet due to their bioactive properties and numerous functional activities. Multiple features of \u03b2-glucan, including anticancer (14), anti-diabetic (15), anti-inflammatory, and a decrease in the glycemic index as well as serum cholesterol and triglycerides, have been demonstrated. \u03b2-glucans maintain the balance of blood glucose and cardiovascular diseases (16), enhance the immune system (17) and wound healing activities (18), and show antimicrobial (antibacterial and antiviral) properties (Figure\u00a0 1). Proved antioxidant, wound healing, and moisturizing properties of \u03b2-glucan derived from microorganisms and cereal (19). These diverse activities of \u03b2-glucans attribute to their physical properties such as water solubility (20), viscosity, and gelation (21). Thus, the physical characteristics of bread and cakes enhance by adding \u03b2-glucan to the recipe (22).\n\u03b2-glucans are known to show a robust immune stimulant (23) and mitigate benign and malignant cancers (24, 25). \u03b2-glucan acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to inhibit the host\u2019s insusceptible reactions (26). When a fungal infection occurs, the host recognizes a crucial PAMP associated with \u03b2-glucan and then stimulates the host\u2019s immunological responses (27). Dendritic and macrophage cells are often regarded as the primary target cells of \u03b2-glucans that also stimulates neutrophils, B, T, and natural killer cells to attach pathogens (25, 28, 29). Approximately 100 trillion microbial cells inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of the human, which encode 100 times more genes than the human genome (30). In addition, microbial cells are present in approximately 10 times the number of human cells (30, 31). This microbial community contains an estimated 5,000 bacterial species, mainly belonging to Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (31). The gut microbiota studies understand the status of different gut conditions between diseases and healthy for improving gut integrity, controlling host immunity, safeguarding the host against microbes, harvesting energy, and unraveling dietary utilizing molecular mechanisms (32, 33). The gut bacterial community plays a significant role in maintaining human wellbeing by producing many fundamental health-benefiting substances, including synthesizing vitamin K (34), promoting angiogenesis, involving host metabolic processes, and altering the appetite signaling pathway (35\u2013 38). Recent evidence also revealed that gut microbiota is critical in advancing cerebrum capabilities connecting with uneasiness, sorrow, stress, and cognizance (39, 40). There is always an association between gut dysbiosis and numerous chronic diseases (41), such as cardiovascular, autism, cancer, and obesity (42, 43). Dietary supplementation with indigestible polysaccharides obtained from plants, fungi, and probiotics benefits health by promoting microbial community growth (44). Bacterial fermentation occurs when dietary fibers enter the colon (45), and as a result, they produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs such as acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) (46), biogenic amines (47), indole and tryptophan derivatives (48), and secondary bile acids, conferring a health benefit. Microbialproduced SCFAs play significant parts in the proliferation of immune cells, apoptosis, cell differentiation, chemotaxis, and gene expression (49). Bile acids (50) and tryptophan derivatives (48) also play a gene\nFIGURE\u00a01 Different beneficial properties of \u03b2-glucans.

Representative structures of \u03b2-glucans are made as per symbolic nomenclature for glycans (https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/glycans/snfg.html).

The gut microbial communities harbor several unique genes that encode different enzymes to break down carbohydrates, including glycoside hydrolases, amino acid decarboxylases, carbohydrate esterases, and polysaccharide lyases (51). These highly diverse thousands of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) of microbial communities are referred to as the host\u2019s secondary genome (52). Therefore, the usage of dietary fibers entirely depends on CAZymes.\nGram-negative microorganisms, sjuch as Bacteroides, possess many glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases (35), while Gram-positive bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (36), primarily have glycoside hydrolases for breaking down different types of dietary fiber (53). How these microbes utilize dietary fiber and their produced metabolites modulate the immune system are outstanding questions among glycobiologists and biochemists. However, there are few known molecular mechanisms for digesting \u03b2-glucan by bacteria and structure-functional interactions between \u03b2-glucan and the immune system. The latest understanding of them is summarized here."

The gut microbiome populace overwhelmingly incorporates the individual from phyla Bacteroidetes (primarily Bacteroides and Prevotella), Firmicutes (primarily Clostridia genus), Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria (56, 57). Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the major phyla that account for approximately 90% of the total bacteria in the adult gut. Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria regulate the immune system, formation of the gut microbiome, and defense against pathogen invasion (58). They maintain the microbiome and immune systems through an integrated metabolic energy-harvesting process based on dietary fiber crossfeeding (syntrophy) and co-metabolism, including polyphenols (36, 59).\nIndividuals from the Bacteroidetes, a predominant phylum in the human gut, have polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) to focus on a wide variety of complex glycans. The arrangement of genes centered on tandem susC/susD homologs that code for the TonBdependent transporter (TBDT) and the cell-surface glycan-binding protein (SGBP) (60). Extra colocalized and co-regulated SGBP(s), susC/susD, and a transcriptional regulator typically make up machinery that detects, imports, and upregulates a PUL in the presence of glycans (61). Only a few PULs have been now biochemically characterized in Bacteroidetes, despite a massive number of them being recognized (62). For utilizing \u03b2-(1,3)glucans, bacteria use activities of \u03b2-(1,3) glucanases (EC 3.2.1.6 and EC 3.2.1.39) and \u03b2-(1,3) glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.58) that have a place with the glycoside hydrolase families, GH5, GH16, GH17, GH55, GH64, GH81, GH128, and GH158 (63). \u03b2-(1,3)-glucanases breakdown the glycan with internal glucoside bonds and make\noligosaccharides. \u03b2-(1,3)-glucosidases act on the non-reducing ends of \u03b2-(1,3)-glucans and discharge glucose from oligosaccharides (64). Some endo-acting \u03b2-(1,3)-glucanases have carbohydrate binding domains to enhance their capacity to bind substrates that are not soluble in water (65), while \u03b2-(1,6)-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.75), a member of the GH30 family, is necessary to dissect \u03b2-(1,6) linked branched chains (33)."

This interaction determines the balancing of the gut microbiota and preventing of non-communicable diseases (66, 67). Indeed, \u03b2-glucan is a non-digestible carbohydrate and acts as a substrate for improving colonic microbes as they are permitted to go through the small intestine due to their resistance to absorption (68, 69). Several studies on \u03b2-glucans that modulate gut microbiota are presented in Table\u00a01.\n\u03b2-glucan increases the growth of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis both in vivo and in vitro (81). Cereal \u03b2-glucans were fed to experimental rats for 3, 6, and 7 weeks, and the results showed that the population of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus was enhanced (82). Clostridiaceae (Clostridium orbiscindens and Clostridium sp.), Roseburia hominis, Ruminococcus sp., and low levels of Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were found to be\u00a0more abundant after the consumption of whole grain barley pasta and durum wheat flour rich in \u03b2-glucan (74). In yogurt, \u03b2-glucans of oats and grains were found to expand the development and reasonability of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (83). An increased gut-bacterial population has positive functional consequences, such as ensuring adequate digestion and preventing constipation, diarrhea, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (84, 85). In addition, integrating high molecular weight oat \u03b2-glucan into milk brings cholesterol down and decreases calories in dairy items (86). Oat and barley-\u03b2-glucans increase beneficial bacterial communities\u2019 population and promote microbial metabolites such as 2-methyl-propanoic, butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid (87\u201389).\nBacterial communities of our gut reveal the diverse digestion capability of dietary glycans. For instance, Bifidobacterium cannot digest complex glycan, such as pectin. Thus, they rely on Bacteroides to produce oligosaccharides from pectin before they can grow. This type of cooperation is known as a syntrophic system, and different bacteria have adjusted their genome through evolution to maintain gut microbial homeostasis (90). Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides are essential members of the gut microbiota, where they occupy approximately 80% of microbial space in infant and adult gut, respectively, involving in the utilization of dietary glycans. Therefore, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium are primary and secondary degraders for utilizing complex and simpler glycans, respectively. Some of the known glycan-utilizing mechanisms are mentioned below pertaining to \u03b2-glucans.\nFrontiers in Nutrition 04 frontiersin.org"

Crystal structures of two practically distinct SusCD complexes purified from B. thetaiotaomicron have derived a standard model for substrate translocation (99). The TBDT forms homodimers, with each \u03b2-barrel protomer tightly capped by SGBP. The single-channel electrophysiology revealed a \u2018pedal bin\u2019 mechanism in which SGBP (SusD homolog) moves away from TBDT (SusC homolog). In the absence of oligosaccharides, the SusD lid of the empty transporter is free and undergoes conformational changes. In the presence of glucan, TonB binds to the TonB box of the transporter to initiate the conformational changes in the plug, extracellular loops of SusC, that lead to oligosaccharide release and the creation of a transport channel into the periplasmic space (99). The TonB promotes the dissociation of glucan into periplasmic space, and then, the transporter (SusC) returns to its open state conformational. The required energy is governed by ExbBD\u2013TonB system, which is equivalent to pressing the pedal to open the SusCD (99). These mechanistic insights into how the outer membrane nutrients are imported inside the periplasm and cytoplasm by microbiota members provide outlines of understanding human\u2013microbiota symbiosis.\nFor example, a mechanism for the utilization of barley-\u03b2-glucan was established in B. ovatus ATCC 8483 and B. uniformis JCM 13288 (61, 100). These studies demonstrated through synteny analyses that the mixed-linkage glucan utilization locus (MLGUL) is widely present among human gut microbiota. The presence of homolog genes within or without locus enables selective Bacteroides species in the gut microbiota to cleave barley-\u03b2-glucan. The locus consists of outer membrane-bound GH16 and a periplasmic GH3 that acts as exo-\u03b2glucosidase. The GH16 cleaves high MW barley-\u03b2-glucan and produces mixed-linkage \u03b2-(1,3)/\u03b2-(1,4) glucan-oligosaccharides. Those oligosaccharides are converted into monomeric units by GH3\u00a0in periplasmic space. The GH3 is a part of the locus or is present in another site of a genome in B. ovatus ATCC 8483 and B. uniformis JCM 13288, respectively (61, 100). Locus outer membrane-bound non-catalytic SGBPs plays essential roles in recruiting and capturing high MW barley-\u03b2-glucan, and the SusD allows mixed-linkage \u03b2-(1,3)/\u03b2-(1,4) glucan-oligosaccharides to enter in periplasmic space in concert with cognate TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) as shown in Figure\u00a02.\nPolysaccharide degradation is accomplished by Gram-positive bacteria by different cellular mechanisms that may not involve TonBdependent transporter systems. These symbionts encode polysaccharide degrading functions with genetic loci that encode ATP binding cassette (ABC), proton symporters, or phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PEP-PTS) transporters. These are co-expressed with associated degradative enzymes (101, 102). Oligosaccharides are internalized by ABC transporter-coupled ATP hydrolysis serving as the primary transport system in Bifidiobacterium. In PEP-PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate serves as the phosphate donor to the recipient monosaccharide, and PTS internalizes monosaccharide and concomitant phosphorylation. Although these systems are present in various bacteria, all Bifidiobacterium do not possess them in their genomes.\nInterestingly, gram-positive polysaccharide utilization loci (gpPULs) are present in families of Roseburia and Eubacterium rectale that ideally consist of ABC transport proteins, transcriptional\nregulator genes, and glycoside hydrolases (103). Such gpPULs are found to involve in the utilization of konjac glucomannan and spruce acetylated galactoglucomannan (104) and xylan and arabinogalactan utilization (103). We\u00a0 have identified \u03b2-glucan utilizing gpPUL in Blautia producta ATCC 27340 and widely presence in many species of Lachnospiraceae (98). Distinct from Gram-negative bacterial PUL, gpPUL does not encode SGBP, but the glycan-binding function is likely to perform by carbohydrate-binding modules associated with endo-acting enzymes. The gpPUL also encodes a transcriptional regulator gene that seems to control the expression of the locus in the presence of suitable carbon (105).\nIn a symbiosis system between Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, it was observed that Bacteroides cellulosilyticus and Bacteroides ovatus share \u03b2-(1,3)/(1,6)-glucooligosaccharides with Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 and Bifidobacterium bifidum (102). Zhao and Cheung (106) suggested that B. infantis, B. longum, and B. adolescentis can ferment \u03b2-glucans obtained from mushroom sclerotia, seaweed, bacteria, and barley. Among them, B. infantis produces double amount of SCFAs than other two Bifidobacterium. However, a systematic evaluation of \u03b2-glucans utilization is required to use species for mitigating gut-related syndromes through appropriate modulation."

            "text": "The capability of gut Bacteroidetes to reckon and respond to diverse glycans in their environment is bestowed in many extracellular sensor-regulator systems that are closely associated with the PUL they encode. The most biochemically and structurally well-characterized system in Bacteroidetes is the hybrid two-component system (HTCS) (107). HTCS is a cytoplasmic membrane-spanning protein that comprises all domains of a classical two-component system in one polypeptide (N-terminal extracellular sensor, cytoplasmic histidine kinase, and response regulator). Signal recognition in HTCS takes place via the direct binding of oligosaccharide fragments to the periplasmic sensor domain. These oligosaccharides are products of polysaccharide degradation at the outer membrane cell surfacetethered PUL-encoded endo-acting enzymes. The produced oligosaccharides were earlier transported into the periplasm by the TBDT (SusC homolog). In some cases, oligosaccharides process further via periplasmic enzymes before acting as activating signals (108).\nAlthough the sensing system in Gram-positive bacteria is not extensively known as in Gram-negative bacteria, there are few transporters known to mediate glucan uptake and can readily utilize them through highly conserved sequences of the solute binding protein (Figure\u00a02B). For instance, in Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis to overcome the need for HTCS has the presence of an ABC transport system that allows the tethering and uptake of complex glycan such as arabinoxylan. The solute-binding protein, such as BlAXBP, of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter mediates the uptake of arabinoxylan\u2013oligosaccharides with exceptionally broad specificity for tri-saccharides and tetra-saccharides of undecorated xylo- and arabinose-decorated-oligosaccharide (109). Crystal structures of BlAXBP suggested that a spacious binding pocket and the conformational flexibility of a lid-like loop facilitate the binding of decorated oligosaccharides. The BlAXBP is highly conserved within Bifidobacterium and highlights the gut microbiota metabolic\nFrontiers in Nutrition 06 frontiersin.org\nsyntrophy with other species. The occurrence of transport systems is a prerequisite for utilizing glucan- oligosaccharides and xylooligosaccharides. Solute-binding protein is also identified in Limosilactobacillus reuteri ATCC 53608 and Blautia producta ATCC 27340 for utilizing xylooligosaccharides (105).\nThe expression of the locus or gene involved in utilizing available carbon sources is suppressed by the presence of a preferred glycan. It is controlled by carbon catabolite repressor (CCR), a regulatory system in most bacteria (92). It is accomplished by different regulatory mechanisms, including the regulator of translation by an RNA-binding protein in diverse bacteria. The CCR-related metabolism was first seen in B. animalis subsp. lactis (110). It was also observed in other members of Bifidobacterium that can control the expression of genes involved in the utilization of raffinose, sucrose, or oligofructose (111).\nThe mechanism by which a glycan is utilized by Bifidobacterium is not yet well established as it is known for Bacteroides. Due to their usage in probiotics, detailed emphasis should be\u00a0given to how specific genes/enzymes sense, break-down, and import complex glycans inside the cytoplasmic space by gram-positive bacteria. Novel pathways from Bifidobacterium would clearly elucidate the metabolites that play a role in maintaining gut homeostasis. The members of Lachnospiraceae express a gpPUL that consists of the transcriptional regulator (103, 104); however, the defined function of the such regulator is not yet known. The function of such a regulator should exploit by further studies.\n4. Immunomodulatory effects of \u03b2-glucan\nThe gut microbiota constantly interacts with the immune system aiding diverse processes such as behavior, digestion, as well as the maturation of the immune system (Table\u00a02); thus, it shows a symbiotic relationship with the host (138, 139). The immune system is also acknowledged as one of the most critical factors that affect the composition of the gut microbiota through cross-talk between immunity and microbiome (140). The colonization of gut microbiota can mediate and influence the production of antimicrobial peptides/ bacteriocins through epithelial cells and pattern recognition receptors encoded by intestinal layers (141).\nIn addition to the interaction of immunity and microbiome, \u03b2-glucans are considered one of our diet\u2019s active ingredients that show immunological benefits. They can interact with various immunological receptors, including Dectin-1, complement receptor (CR3), and tolllike receptors (TLR) 2/6. This causes several immune cells to be\u00a0 triggered, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer cells (142). \u03b2-glucans can modulate innate and adaptive responses, and they can also improve opsonic as well as non-opsonic phagocytosis (143, 144). The intricacy of their structure governs diverse \u03b2-glucan immune functions. Stronger immune-modulating and anti-cancer actions are correlated with\nFIGURE\u00a02 \u03b2-glucan utilizing mechanisms in Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive. (A) Gram-negative bacteria can hydrolyze polysaccharides at the outer membrane tendered glycoside hydrolase (GH) and convert into oligosaccharides. Those polysaccharides first recognize by surface glycan-binding protein and facilitate endo-acting enzymes to cleave them. Generated oligosaccharides are again caught by SusD, and it allows them to enter the periplasmic space through TonB\u00a0- dependent transporter (SusC homolog). Entered oligosaccharides further cleave into monosaccharide contents by periplasmic GH.

The direct binding of \u03b2-glucans to particular immune cell receptors raises the possibility of an immunological modulatory action independent of microbes (146).\nThe ability of an innate immune system to rapidly recognizing and reacting to invasive pathogens is crucial for infection control. \u03b2-glucan guards against illness brought on by bacteria, viruses, and other harmful microbes (147). During in vivo investigations, \u03b2-glucans were tagged with fluorescein to monitor their oral uptake and digestion (148). The orally administered \u03b2-glucans bind to the Dectin-1, a type II transmembrane \u03b2-glucan receptor, on the macrophages and get taken up by the cell (149). It was demonstrated that low MW \u03b2-glucans bind strongly with Dectin-1 as compared with HW ones (150). It was subsequently moved to the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. Large \u03b2-(1,3)-glucans get degraded by macrophages within the bone marrow and produce smaller, soluble \u03b2-(1,3)-glucan fragments (Figure\u00a03). This soluble \u03b2-(1,3)-glucan fragments were then recognized through CR3 of the circulating monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes (151). These granulocytes with CR3-bound \u03b2-glucanfluorescein when enrolled to a site of complement activation were enabled CR3 to trigger cytotoxicity of inactivated complement 3b (iC3b)-opsonized tumor cells, covered in monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (148). Yeast \u03b2-(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan and barley \u03b2-(1,3)/(1,4)glucan potentiated the action of anti-tumor mAb, leading to more robust tumor regression and survival (148). When a lentinan, a type\nof \u03b2-glucan, binds to dectin-1, it activates Syk kinase that regulates COX2 expression, modulating immune responses.\nLentinan isolated from the fruiting bodies of Lentinus edodes is a popular medication with anti-infective and anti-tumor activities. RAW264.7 cell line\u2019s cytotoxic activities and inflammatory cytokine production were enhanced by lentinan (29, 152). The dendritic cells show enhanced phenotypic and functional maturation and produce a considerable amount of IL-10 and IL-12 due to the presence of lentinan (115). Lentinan acts as a vaccine adjuvant, enhancing the virus-specific CD8(+) T cell functions generated by DNA vaccination in HBcAg (pB144) in mice (112) and raising T cell functions in mice with tumors (113) and malaria-infected mice. Lentinan-induced dendritic and macrophage cells indirectly activate T cells by producing IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 (117). Lentinan increases NK cell-mediated death of Yac-1 cells in both in vitro and in vivo experiments (114).\nIn contrast to the Dectin-1-Cox2 signaling axis, mannan/\u03b2-(1,6)glucan-containing polysaccharides (MGCP) facilitate regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation from na\u00efve T cells. Additionally, it confines Th1 differentiation of effector T cells based on a TLR2-dependent mechanism through suppressing IFN-\u03b3 expression. Thus, the administration of MGCP exhibits a strong suppressive capability toward investigational colitis and autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice models. It highlights the potential therapeutic utility of MGCP against clinically related autoimmune diseases (153). \u03b2-glucan-based"

Dectin-1 contains six cysteine residues among 244 amino acids, particularly Trp221 and His223 are situated close to the fourth cysteine residue, which is especially important for \u03b2-glucan binding (166\u2013168). On the cytoplasmic tail, an ITAM-like motif (YxxI/ Lx7YxxL) communicates through the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) in cooperation with TLR 2 and 6 (161).\nUpon \u03b2-glucan binding, Src family kinases phosphorylate the tyrosine in the ITAM sequence via interacting with Syk\u2019s two SH2 domains (Src homology 2) (169). For the enzyme activation, the YxxL sequences must be\u00a0spaced apart to engage both of the SH2 domains of Syk family kinase (Figure\u00a0 5). It has been known that Dectin-1 multimerizes upon ligand binding and then provides a binding site for the Syk kinase (170). The recruited Syk activates the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) and CARD9Bcl10-MALT1 pathways to induce dendritic cell maturation, co-stimulatory molecules, and inflammatory cytokines (171). Additionally, it also promotes Th1 and Th17 responses to arrange immunity to pathogens (172). Ligand-binding Dectin-1 activates phospholipase C\u03b3 via phosphorylation and then activated phospholipase C\u03b3 generates inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol for triggering an intracellular Ca2+ flux in dendritic cells (173). Elevated concentration of Ca2+ is crucial for secreting IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-23, and TNF \u03b1. Dectin-1 also modulates the expression of cytokines via activating the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) that regulates IL-2, IL-10, and IL-12 p70 production (174).\nA 2.8 \u00c5 high-resolution crystal structure of murine Dectin-1 was obtained with a laminaritriose and revealed higher order complex formation between Dectin-1 and \u03b2-glucans (142). It comprises two antiparallel \u03b2-sheets and two \u03b1-helices with domain integrity\nFIGURE\u00a03 Illustration of the different consequences of \u03b2-glucan recognition by immune cells in the context of fungal infection.

It has been postulated that hydrophobic contacts might play a key role in \u03b2-glucan binding (142, 175). Alanine mutations confirmed that Trp221 and His223 at the surface groove are critical in the formation of the \u03b2-glucan binding site on Dectin-1, and this site finds to be\u00a0conserved among Dectin-1 of murine, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, cow, and humans (168). It was further proposed that a minimum length of the ligand should be\u00a010 to 11 of \u03b2-linked glucose residues (163), and Dectin-1\u2013\u03b2-glucan complex might get more robust in the presence of divalent ions (142). Takano et\u00a0 al. (176) observed that low-valency \u03b2-glucan (such as fucan, a seaweed) only activates human Dectin-1 but not murine Dectin-1, and this specificity is determined by intracellular domain rather than a ligand-binding domain. Therefore, a complex structure of \u03b2-glucan can activate both types of Dectin-1.\nA previous study by Brown, O\u2019Callaghan (142) theoretically suggested that CTLD of Dectin-1 undergo oligomerization and form a quaternary structure when ligand binding to CTLD. It was proposed based on the Syk kinase\u2019s binding to the cytoplasmic parts of two nearby Dectin-1 monomers as part of a signaling pathway. Dulal et\u00a0al. (177) further reinforced this evidence by demonstrating laminarin binding. The study observed that it forms a tetramer of CTLD when four laminarin molecules bound to four CTLD cooperatively. The formation of oligomerization seems to be\u00a0physiologically relevant in triggering intracellular signaling. This formation is quite appropriate for eliminating fungal pathogens through phagocytosis and triggering a pro-inflammatory immune response. This reckoning can be\u00a0used for the rational design of \u03b2-glucans-based immunomodulatory therapy."

TLRs are the type I\u00a0transmembrane receptors that belong to glycoproteins. TLRs have three domains as follows: (A) an intracellular Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is essential for downstream signal transduction, (B) a single transmembrane domain, and (3) an extracellular domain (consisting of leucine-rich repeats) that recognizes specific PAMPs (178). They are present in dendritic cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, B cells, and T cells. Microbes such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa can get recognized by TLRs (179). The ligand-receptor binding activates several signaling pathways, including TRIF-mediated and MyD88-mediated signaling that are associated with the recruitment of neutrophils through fast mobilization (180). TRIF-mediated and MyD88 signaling also cause NF-\u03baB activation and MAPK signaling (131, 181). NF-\u03baB is a predominant transcription factor, which is intricate in the TLR-mediated production of cytokines (Figure\u00a04).\n\u03b2-Glucans modulate the signaling of TLR2 and TLR4 (182). It was found that \u03b2-glucans suppressed TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production by microglia via binding to Dectin-1 (183). Zymosan binding with Dectin-1 enhances TLR2/4/6-mediated production of IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and ROS through NF-\u03baB signaling from macrophage and dendritic cells (182). Dectin-1 activation by particulate \u03b2-glucans was shown to promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 in THP-1 macrophages via co-binding with TLR2 and TLR4 (184), as also shown in Figure\u00a04. The study also suggested that particulate \u03b2-glucan exhibited a stronger immune response than soluble. In addition to zymosan, barley-\u03b2-glucan is also interacted\nwith TLR2 and Dectin-1 and induces inflammatory responses in Leishmania donovani-infected macrophages (158). Thus, these studies demonstrated that \u03b2-glucans are an immune regulatory ligand for TLR2 and TLR4 and can be\u00a0manipulated in the clearance of pathogens."

MSK1 and 2 switches on CREB through phosphorylation on the IL-10 gene promoter that promotes IL-10 mRNA transcription. In addition, ERK1/2 also inhibits IL-10 mRNA transcription via MSK and p38 independent pathways, although this mechanism is not precisely known yet (154). Dectin-1 also activates NF-\u03baB, which inducts IL-2, 6, and 10 transcriptions. Produced cytokines activate monocytes and circulatory cytotoxic T-cells (113).

CR3 was initially anticipated to be\u00a0 the main (1,3)-\u03b2-glucan receptor on leukocytes but the ability of CR3-deficient leukocytes to still reckon and respond to (1,3)-\u03b2-glucans and the discovery of Dectin-1 suggests that CR3 may only display a minor role for macrophage and dendritic cells (reference herein).\nBased on immunological studies, \u03b2-glucans considered active compounds to induce immune effects and initiate anti-microbial immune responses and anti-tumor activities. \u03b2-glucans emerged as an effective immunomodulatory as it acts on various immunological receptors, namely, Dectin-1, CR3, LacCer, SR, and TLR-2/6.

A subsequent study showed that glucan lowered triglyceride levels, total cholesterol by 32% and malondialdehyde levels by 45% (229). LDL and total cholesterol levels considerably decreased when Granoro\u2019s Cuore Mio pasta was supplemented with barley-\u03b2-glucans (3 g/100 g) (230).

The pathogenesis of CVD is heavily influenced by microbial dysbiosis (234). Microbial communities control CVD and atherosclerosis by regulating the production of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) (43). Trimethylamine is a precursor of TMAO, which is formed in the gut via peculiar bacterial choline trimethylamine (TMA) lyases. Specifically, TMA moieties (such as choline, phosphatidylcholine, and L-carnitine) containing fatty acids are converted to TMA by bacterial TMA lyase via various metabolic pathways (235). Formed TMA is transported to the liver, where it is converted into TMAO by hepatic flavin monooxygenase 3, FMO3 (236). A previous study showed that oat-\u03b2-glucan promotes the expansion of the Verrucomicrobia population (such as Akkermansia muciniphila), which has a prebiotic impact on alterations in circulatory lipids and decreases the number of plaques in the aortic walls as compared with simvastatin (is an oral antilipemic agent) (213). In addition, oral administration of live A. muciniphila minimizes the expansion of atherosclerotic lesion formation and systemic inflammation in the aortic as well as enhanced intestinal integrity in atherosclerotic Apoe\u2212/\u2212 mice (213). Plovier, Everard (237) used pasteurized A. muciniphila in mice model experiments and observed that their administration could suppress HFD-induced expression of FMO3 compared with control diet-fed mice. This evidence specifies that A. muciniphila protects against CVD development in live or pasteurized conditions. The Firmicutes to Bactereoidetes ratio is significantly higher in persons at risk for cardiovascular disease, in which Prevotella and Klebsiella species are abundant in assessing the fecal microbiota of atherosclerotic CVD patients (238).

            "text": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disorder that is categorized by hyperglycemia resulting from failings in insulin secretion from \u03b2 cells of the pancreas and insufficient insulin action. This is typically characterized by symptoms such as polyuria, polyphagia, polydipsia, and weight loss (239). T2D links to a modified gut microbial population that exhibits less diversity and resilience (240).\n\u03b2 cells are responsible for insulin production, and produced insulin is stored in secretory granules. High glucose concentrations in the blood mainly trigger insulin release; however, it can also induce by the availability of fatty acids and amino acids in the blood (241). A solute carrier protein called glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) primarily serves as a glucose sensor for \u03b2 cells in rodents (242), while GLUT1 is suggested to take a significant role in glucose uptaking by many cells in humans including \u03b2 cells (243). When circulating glucose level increases, \u03b2 cells mostly absorb glucose via the GLUT2 (244, 245). The glucose catabolism is activated when the glucose enters into \u03b2 cells. Cytoplasmic glucose immediately converts into phosphorylated glucose and enters into a glycolysis cycle to produce pyruvate. Pyruvate transports to mitochondria, which processes in the Krebs cycle to generate ATP. It increases the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio, stimulating the plasma membrane\u2019s ATP-dependent potassium channels to close. It causes the membrane to depolarize and the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels to open, letting Ca2+ into the cell. The increased intracellular Ca2+ causes the secretory insulincontaining granules to prime and fuse to the plasma membrane, leading to insulin exocytosis (246). Additionally, ryanodine receptors (RYR), primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and on the secretory vesicles, can amplify Ca2+ signals and are involved in increasing the secretion of insulin when the channel is sensitized by the influx of messenger molecules (247, 248). Such a process is called Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). Many glycolytic intermediates, such as ATP, cAMP, cyclic ADP ribose, nitric oxide (NO), long-chain acyl CoA, and high luminal Ca2+ concentration, have been shown to sensitize RY receptors (248). Perhaps, the most significant messenger promoting insulin released is cAMP, thereby increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration (249, 250).\nChronic hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are vital causative factors for T2D, disrupting endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis to\ninduce unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. If homeostasis cannot revert to customary conditions, the ER recruits death signaling pathways, which leads to \u03b2-cell death (251). High levels of saturated free fatty acids can cause ER stress that activates the UPR pathway by various mechanisms, such as inhibition of the enzyme that mobilizes ER Ca2+ (i.e., ER Ca2+ ATPase), activation of IP3 receptors, and/or directly impairing ER homeostasis (241). During high blood glucose levels, proinsulin biosynthesis and islet amyloid polypeptides (IAAP) are significantly increased in \u03b2 cells. These abrupt changes in glucose levels lead to the accumulation of misfolded insulin and IAAP in \u03b2 cells. It ultimately increases the production of oxidative protein folding-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) (251). Therefore, physiological ER Ca2+ mobilization gets altered by these effects, which favors the degradation of proinsulin mRNA and pro-apoptotic signals. ROS promotes releasing of interleukin (IL)-1, which attracts macrophages and intensifies local islet inflammation (252).\nReduction in SCFAs synthesis due to intestinal dysbiosis encourages pancreatic \u03b2-cell proliferation, insulin production, and glucose tolerance, showing that these impacts are dependent on shortchain fatty acid receptors FFA2 and FFA3\u00a0in mouse model system (253). Synthesis of additional metabolites, including TMA and branched amino acids, can also cause dysbiosis, disrupt glucose homeostasis, and trigger the development of T2D (241). A study including 277 non-diabetic Danish people discovered that the human gut microbiome populations have an effect on serum metabolome and are linked to insulin resistance (254). Butyrate-producing bacteria having anti-inflammatory properties such as Clostridium, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium species, have reduced significantly in T2D patients, while the population of gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia, increases high levels of lipopolysaccharides, LPS. LPSs are responsible for low-grade inflammation, causing glucose metabolism abnormalities in T2D patients (255). Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus were found to be\u00a0the primary species driving the relationship between the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) biosynthesis and insulin resistance in a Danish cohort of non-diabetic males. The study further stated that P. copri can cause insulin resistance, exacerbate glucose intolerance, and increase mouse circulating BCAA levels (254, 256). It suggests that intestinal microbiota could be\u00a0 an essential resource for increased levels of BCAAs and display a key role in insulin resistance.\n\u03b2-Glucan Model system Impact References Aminated \u03b2-1,3-D-glucan and interferon-\ngamma\nSyngeneic mice Inhibited the growth of liver\nmetastases significantly.\nSveinbjornsson et\u00a0al.

The C57BI/6 mouse was fed with \u03b2-glucan and observed that they were evolved to have a diabetic metabolic phenotype despite possessing the same genetic determinants, suggesting that the alteration in the gut microbiota population may be\u00a0a significant factor in the development of diabetic metabolic phenotype (258). \u03b2-glucans can play an essential role in increasing the viscosity of a meal during digestion in the intestine, slowing down gastric emptying, limiting the absorption of macronutrients, and entrapping cholesterol and bile acids (259). Thus, \u03b2-glucans lower cholesterol and serum sugar levels in T2D (Table\u00a03)."

            "text": "Dysbiosis in the gut microbiota causes human colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is the third most common type of cancer with about 2 million new cases every year, and the gut microbiome can modulate a crucial role in their progression or prevention (260). The presence of healthy or altered gut microbiomes determines the formation and progression of CRC (261). The altered gut microbiome during dysbiosis negatively impacts CRC treatments with chemotherapy and immunotherapy (262, 263). A few bacteria, namely, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, and Prevotella intermedia, are suggested to associate with CRC conditions (264). These bacteria can cause initial inflammation and modulate different signaling pathways for the progression of CRC (265\u2013267). The biological action of gut microbiota interrupts the control of the cell cycle by generating genotoxins which may lead to oxidative stress and a chronic inflammatory state (268). Bacterial metabolites, such as SCFAs, can also suppress the development of CRC. Among other SCFAs, butyrate is considered an essential metabolite and plays a vital role in inhibiting colon cancer because of its capacity to renew the intestinal epithelial cells (267, 269). It improves the tight junction of the epithelial cells, thereby minimizing the translocation of bacteria and metabolites in lamina propria that trigger inflammation (270). In response to dietary intake of fiber-rich foods, species from the Lachnospiraceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, and Ruminococcaceae families produce butyrate, lowering the risk of CRC. Butyrate can reduce tumors through a variety of mechanisms, including apoptosis induction, epigenetic alteration in gene expression, reduction of cell proliferation, and manipulation of cytokine levels and inflammatory responses during in vitro studies (271, 272). In particular, Donohoe, Collins (273) decisively demonstrated that due to undergoing the Warburg effect, colon cancerous cells primarily rely on uptaking glucose instead of butyrate as a primary carbon source for the production of lactate. Because of that effect, butyrate continuously collects in the cells and at certain physiological concentrations, it acts as an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, leading to the death of the cancerous cells. In\naddition to butyrate, bacteriocins produced by gut bacteria can prevent CRC through their cytotoxic activities as it was demonstrated by clinical studies (274). Phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites are also associated with the prevention of CRC (275).\nDietary non-digestible carbohydrates enhance the protection against CRC (276). \u03b2-glucans, such as lentinan, schizophyllan, scleroglucan, and grifolan extracted from mushrooms, have been studied for controlling CRC via modulation of gut microbiota and regulation of immune genes (223, 277) (Table\u00a03). \u03b2-glucans reduce the risk of CRC bt activating leukocytes, synthesizing antiinflammatory cytokines, and activating immune cells (Figure\u00a0 3). \u03b2-glucans were found to be\u00a0an immunomodulatory agent and can be\u00a0beneficial for breast cancer patients as a supplemental or adjuvant therapy (278, 279). \u03b2-glucans had less impact on white blood cells, significantly reducing the level of IL-4\u00a0in breast cancer patients, while IFN-\u03b3 and \u03b2-glucans together have completely stopped liver metastasis from growing cancerous cells (224). The frequently used chemotherapeutic medicines to prevent liver metastases are 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin. These performed better when used in association with lentinan (a \u03b2-glucan) as compared with what they did when used separately. Thus, a better understanding of the roles of \u03b2-glucans in preventing cancer at the mechanism level would be\u00a0helpful in developing nutraceutical therapy."

            "text": "\u03b2-glucan is an essential food ingredient in controlling metabolic dysregulations linked to metabolic syndrome. Nevertheless, the impact of \u03b2-glucan is shaped by their dose, style, MW, and glucoside linkage. Given the intimate symbiotic link between the host and the gut microbiota, it is not surprising to see a divergence from the typical microbiota composition (usually referred to as dysbiosis) in a variety of illness states, ranging from chronic GI diseases to neurodevelopmental disorders. Additionally, \u03b2-glucans have a very minimal probability of having any unfavorable side effects and are reasonably inexpensive. Human gut bacteria display diverse molecular mechanisms for utilizing those \u03b2\u2013glucans and support other bacteria that cannot utilize complex structural \u03b2-glucans. The impacts of \u03b2-glucan on different diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and low immunity, have been examined by several researchers. Notwithstanding, how \u03b2-glucan exerts these many biological actions at the defined and molecular levels is still unclear. Perhaps, immunostimulation may be\u00a0the initial mechanism governing the \u03b2-glucan activity. Specifically, binding of \u03b2-glucan to certain receptors in cells such as macrophage and dendritic cells can trigger the production of different cytokines, which indirectly activates other immune cells, including T and B cells in in vivo setting. The primary method for inhibiting the development of cancer cells and infectious microorganisms in the host may involve systemic immunostimulation. Many \u03b2-glucan receptors in macrophages and dendritic cells including Dectin-1 and TLRs are essential for recognizing \u03b2-glucans, but the precise signaling pathways that lie downstream from each receptor are unknown. Future research should seek to gather this knowledge to help us to use \u03b2-glucans to treat future patients rationally and efficiently.\nFrontiers in Nutrition 16 frontiersin.org"
