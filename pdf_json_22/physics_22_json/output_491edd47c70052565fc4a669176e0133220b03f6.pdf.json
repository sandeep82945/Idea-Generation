They are used to describe memoryless noise in quantum communication [4] or the decoherence processes during quantum computation. The famous Stinespring dilation theorem [5] guarantees that any quantum channel E can be represented by a system-environment Hamiltonian H, a fixed time tfixed and a suitable initial state of the environment %E. In particular, the Schro\u0308dinger equation defines the following transformation of the quantum system\nE[%] = trE [U(tfixed) (%\u2297 %E)U \u2020(tfixed)] , (1)\nwhere U(t) = e\u2212itH (taking h\u0335 = 1) and trE is the partial trace over the environment. Such an open system model of quantum processes suggests that the induced quantum channel can be understood as a composition of shorter (both in time and induced changes) state transformations. However, as was discovered in the seminal work by Wolf and Cirac [1], there exist quantum channels that cannot be written as a concatenation of other channels thus; they are indivisible. This is similar to the prime numbers; they cannot be factorized. In this Letter, we investigate this analogy in more detail and show its powerful applications to structural problems of quantum channels.\nWe are interested to see how a given channel can be factorized into indivisible ones. In particular, our aim is to characterize the families of n-divisible quantum channels, i.e., the channels that are concatenations of at most n quantum channels. As we will see, there are several key\n\u2217 davidphysdavalos@gmail.com \u2020 mario.ziman@savba.sk\ndifferences between divisibility and factorization. First, the special role of unity is played by the class of unitary channels and the appearance of unitary channels in the decomposition is considered as trivial and does not count as being an indivisible channel. Second, the concatenation is not unique; thus, there are different ways the channel can be expressed as composition of nontrivial channels. Third, there exist infinitely divisible channels that can be expressed as a concatenations of infinitely many quantum channels. Their existence follows from the solution of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation [6\u20139], also known as the time-dependent Markovian master equation (see eq. (2)) describing the Markovian time evolution of open quantum systems. For example, in the case of time-independent master equation, the solution reads in the form Et = eLt, where L is the time-independent Lindblad generator. If a channel can be expressed in this form, we call it Markovian. The exponential form implies Et can be expressed as the nth power of quantum channel Fn = eLt/n, i.e., Et = (Fn)n for arbitrary integer n.\nA prominent example of indivisible qubit channel is the so-called optimal quantum NOT process transforming a state % into a noisy version of its \u201corthogonal\u201d state %\u22a5 = 1 \u2212 %. In particular, ENOT(%) = 13(1 + %\n\u22a5). Applying this indivisible channel twice, we obtain\nE2NOT(%) = 2\n3 ENOT (\n1 2 1 ) + 1 3 ENOT (%\u22a5)\n= 2 9 (1 + 1 2 1 ) + 1 9 (1 + %) = 8 9 1 2 1 + 1 9 % ,\nthus, E2NOT = 19I+ 8 9 N , where I is the identity map (noiseless quantum channel) and N is the quantum channel transforming all states into the total mixture state (also known as the completely depolarizing channel). Since N 2 = N , I2 = I, and I \u25cb N = N \u25cb I = N , it follows that the nth power of Dq = qI + (1 \u2212 q)N equals\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n13 45\n1v 3\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n4 M\nar 2\n02 3\n2 Dnq = qnI + (1 \u2212 qn)N = Dqn . Setting q = n \u221a\n1/9, we obtain Dnn\u221a1/9 = E 2 NOT; hence it is n divisible. In summary, this example illustrates that concatenating two indivisible maps might result in an infinitely divisible one. We see that not only is the division not unique, but it might also be qualitatively different.\nIn this Letter, we will show that the set of at most n-divisible (with n \u2265 2) qubit channels is empty for the qubit case, because all of them are either divisible in infinite parts or indivisible. To do this, we will introduce a specific decomposition of general (finite-dimensional) quantum channels into a boundary element of the set of channels and a Markovian channel, i.e., E = eLEboundary, where L is a suitable Lindbladian. Interestingly, for the qubit case we will additionally show that E = eLEindivisible holds for any non-Markovian channel.\nQuantum channels and divisibility.\u2014 Physics of quantum systems is most commonly formulated within the framework of the associated d-dimensional complex Hilbert spaces Hd. We will assume the dimension is finite. The set of linear operators B(Hd) on Hd contains density operators representing quantum states, and quantum channels E are completely positive trace-preserving linear maps acting on B(Hd), i.e., trE(X) = trX for all X \u2208 B(Hd) and (Ik \u2297 E)(A) \u2265 0 for all positive operators A \u2208 B(Hk \u2297 Hd) and all integers k \u2265 1 determining the dimension of the Hilbert space Hk. Let us denote by Cd the set of all quantum channels. Every channel can be (nonuniquely) expressed in the so-called operator-sum form as follows: E[X] = \u2211jKjXK\u2020j , where \u2211jK \u2020 jKj = 1 . The minimum number of operators Kj required in the previous expression is called the Kraus rank of E . If E(1 ) = 1 , the channel is unital. If E[X] = UXU \u2020 for some unitary operator U (meaning UU \u2020 = U \u2020U = 1 ), we say the channel is unitary.\nThe set of quantum channels Cd is convex and closed under the composition. A quantum channel E is called indivisible if it cannot be written as a concatenation of two nonunitary channels, namely, if E = E1E2 implies that either E1 or E2, exclusively, is a unitary channel. If the channel is not indivisible, it is said to be divisible. We denote the set of divisible channels by Cdiv and that of\nindivisible channels by Cdiv. Following this definition, unitary channels are divisible, because for them both (decomposing) channels E1,2 must be unitary. The concept of indivisible channels resembles the concept of prime numbers: Unitary channels play the role of unity (which are not indivisible or prime), i.e., a composition of indivisible and a unitary channel results in an indivisible channel.\nThe ability to divide quantum channels into smaller ones is intimately related with the concept of continuous time evolution, especially with the question of how a given channel can emerge from time evolution. This question has been explored since the seminal work of Evans [10], where it was discovered that the subset of quantum channels CL achievable by (time-independent)\nLindblad master equations is quite limited. In particular, E \u2208 CL if E = eL, where the Lindblad generator L is defined as follows:\nL[%] = i[%,H] + d2\u22121 \u2211 \u03b1,\u03b2=0 G\u03b1\u03b2 (F\u03b1%F \u2020\u03b2 \u2212 1 2 {F \u2020\u03b2F\u03b1, %}) , (2)\nwith G \u2265 0 and {F\u03b1}d 2\u22121 \u03b1=0 form an orthonormal basis of\nB(Hd), i.e., trF \u2020\u03b1F\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 with trFi \u2236= \u03b4i0/ \u221a d. Recently, several classes of divisibility have been found [1, 11]. Let us introduce the set of n-divisible channels C(n). We say E \u2208 C(n) if there exist a collection of channels E1, . . . ,En such that E = E1 \u25cb \u22ef \u25cb En. Clearly, C(n+1) \u2282 C(n) and our goal is to characterize quantum channels inside C(n) \u2216 C(n+1).\nLet us recall that full Kraus rank channels are divisible [1], and, in the case of unital qubit channels, only Kraus rank three channels are indivisible. Using the representation of qubit unital channels from Ref. [12], in which the set of unital channels is represented by a tetrahedron (see fig. 1), the indivisible channels correspond to the faces of the tetrahedron (excluding the edges); thus, they form a subset of measure zero.\nIn what follows, we are ready to state the main theorem.\nTheorem 1 (Lindblad-Boundary decomposition). Any E \u2208 Cd can be written as follows:\nE = eLEboundary, (3)\nwhere Eboundary is a channel in the boundary between Cd and trace-preserving maps, i.e. it has Kraus rank less than d2 [2], with d = dimH, and L is a Lindbladian.\nGiven a channel E , the logic of the proof relies in finding families with the form Ft = e\u2212tLE such that for large t, they no longer parametrize quantum channels. This, together with continuity arguments, let us prove that there exists a value of t such that Ft is a boundary channel. Then, using the invertibility of eL we arrive to the desired decomposition. The formal proof is given in appendix A; there, we stress that the singular case needs a special treatment. Some results from the literature are used for the proof [1, 13, 14].\nLet us note that for nonsingular channels the proof is independent of the order; thus, also the decomposition E = EboundaryeL is possible. However, this is no longer the case for singular channels. Consider, for instance, the completely depolarizing channel N [\u2206] \u2236= 1 /d tr \u2206 and assume that N = EboundaryeL. Since eL is invertible, we can solve for Eboundary, but N e\u2212L = N = Eboundary for all L; this is a contradiction, and, therefore, the decomposition N = EboundaryeL is not possible. An example of the Lindblad-boundary decomposition is given for the depolarizing channel in the appendix B.\nAs a direct consequence we obtain the following theorem.\n3 Theorem 2 (Nonexistence of strict n-divisibility (n \u2265 2) for full Kraus rank channels). Every finite-dimensional quantum channel, E \u2208 Cd, with full Kraus rank, is divisible in an infinite (also uncountable) number of channels.\nLet us now introduce a result concerning the freedom of L.\nProposition 1 (Pure dissipative choice). For any channel, the Lindblad-boundary (LB) decomposition can always be performed by choosing the Lindbladian L to be purely dissipative, i.e. L[\u2206] = \u2211d 2\u22121 \u03b1,\u03b2=0G\u03b1\u03b2 (F\u03b1\u2206F \u2020\u03b2 \u2212 1 2 {F \u2020\u03b2F\u03b1,\u2206}); see eq. (2).\nProof. For non-singular channels, only G participates in the proof of Theorem 1; thus, we can always simply omit the Hamiltonian part of any given generator. On the other hand, for the nonsingular channels a suitable pure dissipative generator must be found (see the appendix C).\nDivisibility of qubit channels.\u2014 Before discussing the results that can be derived using the novel decomposition stated by Theorem 1, let us first discuss corrections of two theorems needed to characterize the boundary of C2 from the point of view of the divisibility. The known results rely on Lorentz normal forms [15], and they arise as an analogous decomposition to singular value decomposition but taking the Lorentz metric instead of the Euclidean.\nFurthermore, we will exploit Theorem 8 in Ref. [16] (being an adaptation of Theorem 3 in Ref. [15]). It turns out this theorem needs to be extended (see Theorem 3 below) and corrected, because its proof does not cover all Lorentz normal forms. An explicit counterexample has been reported in the appendix in Ref. [11].\nTheorem 3 (Lorentz normal forms for qubit channels). Given a qubit quantum channel, there exist two Kraus rank one (not necessarily nonincreasing trace) linear maps over B(H), T1 and T2 such that E = T2MT1, where M is one of the following forms (in the Pauli basis):"

The form M(v, x, z) has at most Kraus rank 3 and M(v,1, z) at most Kraus rank 2.\nUsing Theorem 3 (which proof can be found in the appendix), we can patch the proof of Theorem 23 in Ref. [1], which characterizes indivisible qubit channels. This theorem states that a qubit channel is indivisible if and only\nI\nX\nY\nZ\nE\u03021\nE\u03022\nFIG. 1. Regions of trace-preserving Pauli diagonal maps corresponding to two families with the form e\u2212LtE , t \u2265 0 (with eLt Pauli diagonal with positive eigenvalues [11]). The family corresponding to E\u03021 = diag(1,\u22121/5,\u22121/5,\u22121/5) (red dot), which is not infinitesimally divisible, crosses only indivisible channels (Kraus rank three); this is a manifestation of Theorem 4. On the other hand, the family corresponding to E\u03022 = diag(1,1/5,1/5,1/5) (blue dot) crosses both divisible and indivisible channels. X , Y, and Z denote the Pauli unitaries, solid colors are for the crossings, and transparent and light transparent are for the interior and exterior of the tetrahedron, respectively.\nif it has diagonal Lorentz normal form with Kraus rank 3. The problematic part is the discarding of channels having nondiagonal Lorentz normal form as indivisible. The original proof relies on noticing that the nondiagonal case can always be written as a concatenation of two channels with at most Kraus rank 2. Fortunately a similar trick holds also for the missing cases that we announced in Theorem 3; observe that\nM\u0302(v, x, z) = M\u0302(v,1, z)diag (1, x, x,1) (5)\nwhere M\u0302(v,1, z) and diag (1, x, x,1) have at most Kraus rank two. Now we can define the CP maps E\u0302M = T\u03022M\u0302(v,1, z)T\u03021 and E\u0302D = T\u03022diag(1, x, x,1)T\u03021, such that E\u0302 = E\u0302MT\u0302 E\u0302D with T = T \u221211 T \u221212 (a CP Kraus rank one operation), given that T1,2 are invertible. Then we have a concatenation of two not necessarily trace-preserving CP maps with at most Kraus rank 2, EM and T ED. To finish, Theorem 12 in Ref. [1] guarantees that E can be written as a concatenation of two trace-preserving maps with at most Kraus rank 2. Since Kraus rank 2 maps are infinitesimally divisible (CCP) (see Theorem 19 in Ref. [1]), this completes the correction to the proof.\nHaving Theorem 23 in Ref. [1] valid, we can safely establish that the boundary of the set of qubit channels is completely characterized in terms of the divisibility types discussed here. And what is particularly relevant is that there are only indivisible channels (the ones having Kraus rank 3 and diagonal Lorentz normal form) and infinitesimally divisible channels (the ones having Kraus rank 3 with nondiagonal Lorentz form, Kraus rank 2 and\n4 trivially Kraus rank 1). Using these facts, we can prove the following.\nTheorem 4 (Lindblad-Boundary decomposition of non\u2013 Markovian qubit channels). Let E \u2208 C2 be a qubit channel that is not infinitesimally divisible, i.e., E /\u2208 CCP, and then its Lindblad-boundary decomposition reads\nE = eLEindivisible . (6)\nMoreover, if E is indivisible, then eL is unitary.\nProof. The proof is straightforward if we recall the construction of one-parametric families of the form Ft = e\u2212tLE . We have already proved there always exists some tmin such that Ftmin is a boundary channel. As mentioned above, we may observe it can be only infinitesimally divisible or indivisible. If Ftmin is infinitesimally divisible, then E must be also infinitesimally divisible; thus, we have a contradiction. Therefore, we conclude that Ftmin is indivisible. Thus, qubit channels are either indivisible, infinitesimally divisible, or with the form in eq. (6), i.e. divisible in an arbitrary number of parts due to the infinitesimal divisibility of eL (see fig. 1). This motivates the following theorem.\nTheorem 5 (Nonexistence of strictly n-divisible (n \u2265 2) qubit channels). Every divisible qubit channel is divisible in an infinite (in fact, uncountable) number of channels. Therefore, C (n) 2 \u2216C (n+1) 2 is empty for all integer n \u2265 2 or, equivalently, C (n) 2 = Cdiv2 for all n \u2265 2.\nReduction of the ancilla size and its limitations.\u2014 Notice that the Lindblad-boundary decomposition can be used to reduce the size of the ancilla needed to simulate or implement experimentally arbitrary quantum channels. Since the boundary part is always Kraus rank deficient, the trick is to find a Kraus rank deficient Lindblad part, too. For the qubit case, this size reduction of the ancilla can be enough even to dispense with a qubit. This is stated with the following theorem, which is proved in the appendix E.\nTheorem 6 (Divisibility in Kraus rank deficient channels). Let E \u2208 C2 be a qubit channel\u2014it is divisible in channels with at most Kraus rank 2 if and only if E is infinitesimally divisible (E \u2208 CCP); otherwise, at least one factoring channel has Kraus rank no less than 3.\nTherefore, for infinitesimally divisible qubit channels we can use a smaller quantum register to implement it in a quantum computer (two qubits instead of three, one for the system and one for the ancilla). We constructed such circuit and computed its quantum process tomography in an IBM falcon r4T quantum processor [17, 18]; the averaged fidelity obtained is almost equal to 1, and ten trials are shown in fig. 3. See the appendixes F and G for further details.\nSummary and outlook.\u2014 We proved that strictly ndivisible full Kraus rank channels do not exist for n \u2265 2\nUboundary UeLX\u22230\u27e9 \u03c1 E[\u03c1]\n0.9973\n0.9977\n0.9981\nF id el it y\nFIG. 2.

Box plot of fidelities between the computed Choi matrix (in an IBM falcon r4T quantum processor) and the theoretical one of the channel diag(1,0,0,3/4) (in the Pauli basis) (right). The red line indicates the average. The quantum process tomography was done 10 times; in each of them, there were performed the 12 independent experiments needed, 20 \u00d7 103 times each. See the appendixes F and G for further details.\n(Theorem 2). For the case of qubits, this nonexistence applies to all channels (Theorem 5), thus, divisibility always implies divisibility in an arbitrary number of channels. For the general case, the question remains open for the channels from the boundary between completely positive and noncompletely positive trace-preserving maps. This suggests that the analogy between integer factorization and channel divisibility, that motivates this investigation, leads to significant differences. Moreover, the concept of constructing channels from \u201cprime\u201d channels is qualitatively different from the case of integers. Most likely, we will meet with the same situation if we consider the case of classical channels. However, it would be interesting to see whether there are some differences between classical and quantum channels from the perspective of the divisibility structures.\nIn order to obtain these results, we introduced and investigated a novel Lindblad-boundary decomposition that resembles polar decomposition but including a dissipation term (Theorem 1). To ensure the validity of the results for the qubit case, we patched a theorem from the literature and fixed the proof of the characterization of indivisible channels (Theorem 3). The novel decomposition allow us to construct methods to reduce the size of the ancilla needed to simulate quantum channels in a quantum computer. Moreover, we believe that these results constitute a useful tool for the analysis of quantum channels and motivates further foundational studies of the structural questions on the dynamics of open quantum systems."

            "text": "Theorem 1 (Lindblad-boundary decomposition). Any E \u2208 Cd can be written as follows,\nE = eLEboundary, (A1)\nwhere Eboundary is a channel in the boundary between Cd and trace-preserving maps, i.e. it has Kraus rank less than d2 [2], with d = dimH, and L is a Lindbladian.\nProof. For non-singular channels the proof is straightforward using the properties of the determinant, in particular we stress that if E \u2208 Cd then \u2223detE \u2223 \u2264 1 [1]. Thus, let E \u2208 Cd with \u2223detE \u2223 > 0 and define the family Ft = e\u2212LtE with t \u2208 R+ where L is any Lindblad operator. Now let us compute the determinant detFt = det e\u2212tL detE = etd trG detE . It is clear that \u2223detFt\u2223 > 1 for t > \u2212(d trG)\u22121 log (\u2223detE \u2223) =\u2236 t\u2032, therefore Ft is no longer inside Cd for t > t\u2032. Notice that this does not imply that t\u2032 is the transition time outside Cd as the condition \u2223detFt\u2223 > 1 is only sufficient. The exact transition time can be computed for each map using Choi-Jamio lkowski isomorphism [13]. Since Ft parameterizes a continuous curve inside trace-preserving maps with F0 = E due to the continuity of e\u2212tL, then Ft crosses the boundary of Cd once, otherwise e\ntL could not be a valid channel for all t \u2265 0, which is a contradiction. Therefore there exists some tmin > 0 such that Eboundary \u2236= Ftmin . Since e\u2212tminL is invertible given that tmin is finite, and tminL is a Lindblad operator, we proved the desired relation for invertible channels. For singular channels we cannot longer take advantage of the properties of determinant. To prove this case, a suitable Lindblad generator must be found. Consider the following continuous family of quantum channels,\nE\u03c8,t[\u2206] \u2236= e\u2212t\u00b5\u2206 + (1 \u2212 e\u2212t\u00b5)\u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8\u2223 tr \u2206 (A2)\nfor all \u2206 \u2208 B(H) with \u00b5 > 0 and t \u2265 0. It is easy to prove that E\u03c8,t1E\u03c8,t2 = E\u03c8,t1+t2 , i.e. E\u03c8,t = etL\u03c8 [6] with\n6 L\u03c8[\u2206] = \u00b5 (\u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8\u2223 tr \u2206 \u2212\u2206) the Lindblad generator. We then define the family F\u03c8,t \u2236= e\u2212tL\u03c8E for a given channel E (not necessarily singular). Notice that F\u03c8,t \u2260 E unless E[\u2206] = \u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8\u2223 tr \u2206, thus, we can always choose \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 such that the family F\u03c8,t is non-trivial. Consider now a density matrix \u03c3 such that % = E[\u03c3] \u2260 \u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8\u2223, and define %\u2032 \u2236= F\u03c8,t[\u03c3] = et\u00b5% + (1 \u2212 et\u00b5)\u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8\u2223, by construction % is a density matrix. Now we compute \u27e8\u03c8\u2223%\u2032\u2223\u03c8\u27e9 = et\u00b5 (\u27e8\u03c8\u2223%\u2223\u03c8\u27e9 \u2212 1)+1 and observe that \u27e8\u03c8\u2223%\u2032\u2223\u03c8\u27e9 < 0 for t > \u2212\u00b5\u22121 log (1 \u2212 \u27e8\u03c8\u2223%\u2223\u03c8\u27e9) =\u2236 t\u2032 > 0, provided that 0 \u2264 \u27e8\u03c8\u2223%\u2223\u03c8\u27e9 < 1. Therefore F\u03c8,t is not even positive for t > t\u2032. Following similar arguments from the non-singular case, we can find some tmin such that E = eLEboundary with L \u2236= tminL\u03c8 and Eboundary \u2236= F\u03c8,tmin ."

F is completely positive if and only if \u03c4F \u2265 0 [13], since it is hermitian, tmin coincides with the time for the smaller eigenvalue to be negative. Computing the spectral decomposition of \u03c4F is straightforward if one writes 1 d2 using an orthogonal separable basis {\u2223\u03c6i\u27e9\u2297 \u2223\u03c8j\u27e9}di,j=1 with \u2223\u03c81\u27e9 \u2236= \u2223\u03c8\u27e9.

For the non-singular channels only G participates in the proof of Theorem 1, thus, we can always simply omit the Hamiltonian part of any given generator.

According to Theorem 3 in Ref.

For both cases we have T\u03021 = \u03a6TLT1 \u03a6T. Defining z \u2236= b/a, v \u2236= c/a, d\u2032 = d/a and constructing the Choi-Jamio lkowski matrix ofM, \u03c4M, a direct evaluation of \u03c4M \u2265 0 (i.e. the condition for M to be completely positive (CP)) can be done by computing its eigenvalues. This procedure is simple but tedious, as it relies in the analysis of four inequalities, here we sketch only the analysis: Choosing d\u2032 = 0, cases iii.) and iv.) become evident; cases i.) and ii.) arise by observing that \u03c4M \u2265 0 implies \u2223d\u2032\u2223 \u2264 f(v, z), then we can write d\u2032 = xf(v, z) with x \u2208 [\u22121,1]. The analysis of the Kraus rank is straightforward by observing the number of non-zero eigenvalues of \u03c4M for each case, this finishes the proof."

            "text": "Theorem 6 (Divisibility in Kraus rank deficient channels). A qubit channel, E \u2208 C2, is divisible in channels with at most Kraus rank 2 if and only if it is infinitesimally divisible (E \u2208 CCP), otherwise, at least one factoring channel has Kraus rank no less than 3.\nProof. To prove the theorem we use the fact that a qubit channel is infinitesimally divisible if and only if its Lorentz normal form is infinitesimally divisible too (theorem 17 in Ref. [1]). Now, to prove the first part, assume that E is an infinitesimally divisible qubit channel. If it has Kraus rank 3, it always has non-diagonal\nLorentz normal form (otherwise it would be indivisible due to theorem 23 in Ref. [1]), non-diagonal forms are always divisible in Kraus rank 2 channels according to theorem 3 (and theorem 19 in Ref. [1]). If it has Kraus rank 4 and is non-singular, according to theorem 4 in Ref. [11], its Lorentz normal form is a Pauli channel with the form eL\u0302 = diag (1, \u03b71, \u03b72, \u03b73) (in the Pauli basis with \u03b7i > 0, and up to unitary conjugations). Therefore the components \u03b7i fulfill the following [11],\n\u03b7i \u03b7j\u03b7k \u2265 1, i \u2260 j \u2260 k. (E1)\nThen, we can find three positive numbers \u03bbi \u2264 1 i = 1,2,3 such that\n\u03b7i \u03b7j\u03b7k = 1 \u03bb2i \u2265 1, i \u2260 j \u2260 k. (E2)\nNow solving the equations for \u03b7i i = 1,2,3 we find that \u03b7i = \u03bbj\u03bbk with i \u2260 j \u2260 k, this is,\ndiag(1, \u03b71, \u03b72, \u03b73) = diag(1,1, \u03bb1, \u03bb1)diag(1, \u03bb2,1, \u03bb2) \u00d7 diag(1, \u03bb3, \u03bb3,1). (E3)\nThis means that any infinitesimally divisible Pauli channel is divisible in a bit, phase and bit-phase flip channels, and all of them have Kraus rank 2. Therefore any infinitesimally divisible non-singular qubit channel is divisible in Kraus rank 2 channels. The non-singular case (also with Kraus rank 4) is proved in the following way. First observe that according to the proof of theorem 5 in Ref. [11], the only infinitesimally divisible Pauli channels (up to unitary conjugations) have the form diag(1,0,0, \u03bb) with 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1. For this case we can use directly the Lindblad-Boundary decomposition and write diag(1,0,0, \u03bb) = diag(1,1, \u03bb, \u03bb)diag(1,0,0,1), both factoring channels have Kraus rank 2. Therefore any infinitesimally divisible qubit channel is divisible in Kraus rank 2 channels. To prove the second part assume now that E is not infinitesimally divisible. According to theorem 4 of our main text, the minimum Kraus rank that a factoring channel can have is 3, otherwise the channel would be infinitesimally divisible. This finishes the proof."

In the case of infinitesimally divisible qubit channels, this reduction is enough to dispense with a qubit. This is, full Kraus rank channels need a four-dimensional ancillary system to be simulated (two qubits), but according to theorem 6 we can do it using only one qubit for infinitesimally divisible channels (since they can be divided in\n8 Kraus rank 2 channels that just need a two-dimensional ancillary system, i.e. a qubit).

After implementing the first factoring channel, the ancillary qubit needs to be reset, thus, the circuit needs a bit to classically\ncontrol the ancillary bit after it is measured. Depending in which state the ancilla collapsed, the bit controls a bit flip on it. After this control, one applies the second unitary corresponding to the Lindblad part.

In the next section we implement this example in a quantum computer.\nAppendix G: Implementation in quantum processor\nIn this section we implement the channel given in eq. (F1) (with \u03bb = 3/4) in a IBM falcon r4T quantum processor [17], and provide the python [18] code used to perform quantum process tomography. In particular, the code computes the fidelities between the quantum computed and theoretical Choi matrices, see figure 2 in the main text. Unfortunately the falcon r4T processor does not support classically controlled operations, thus, to implement the circuit in fig. 3 we make use of the deferred and implicit measurement principles [14], see fig. 4. This is, we include a third qubit that is used simply as a bit. This is, instead of measuring the ancillary qubit, we use it as a quantum control of the third qubit to \u201cwrite\u201d its state on it, then we use such qubit to control back the ancillary qubit and flip it. Deferred and implicit measurement principles guaranty that the statistics obtained are exactly the same as in circuit of fig. 3. Since the third qubit is used simply as a bit, the circuit effectively needs only two qubits.\nIn what follows we show one of the ten experimentally obtained Choi matrices of the channel, and the theoretical one to compare,\nChoiexperimental = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c \u239d 0.87815 0.0104 \u2212 0.03035i 0.001725 \u2212 0.040975i 0.0119 \u2212 0.011i 0.0104 + 0.03035i 0.12185 \u22120.0066 \u2212 0.0091i \u22120.001725 + 0.040975i 0.001725 + 0.040975i \u22120.0066 + 0.0091i 0.1649 0.0046 + 0.00495i 0.0119 + 0.011i \u22120.001725 \u2212 0.040975i 0.0046 \u2212 0.00495i 0.8351 \u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f \u23a0 ,\n(G1)\nChoitheoretical = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c \u239d 0.875 0 0 0 0 0.125 0 0 0 0 0.125 0 0 0 0 0.875 \u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f \u23a0 .
