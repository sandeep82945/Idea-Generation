    "abstractText": "Quercetin is one of the most powerful bioactive dietary flavonoids. The in vivo biological study of quercetin is extremely difficult due to its very low solubility. However, diorganotin complexes of quercetin are more useful when contrasted with quercetin due to increased solubility. In the present study, quercetin, substituted biguanide synthesized in the form of Schiff base and its di-alkyl/aryl tin (IV) complexes were obtained by condensing Schiff base with respective di-alkyl/aryl tin (IV) dichloride. Advanced analytical techniques were used for structural elucidation. The results of biological screening against Gram-positive/Gram-negative bacteria and fungi showed that these diorganotin (IV) derivatives act as potent antimicrobial agents. The in silico investigation with dihydropteroate (DHPS) disclosed a large ligand\u2013receptor interaction and revealed a strong relationship between the natural exercises and computational molecular docking results.",

On the other hand, organotin complexes are the most diverse segment of chemical compounds with applications ranging from material science and catalytic activities to therapeutic agents for various diseases due to their wide variety of interesting structural possibilities [27]. Organotin compounds occupied an important place in cancer chemotherapy reports [28] due to their cytotoxic effects, ability to bind with DNA, anti-proliferating nature, and apoptotic-inducing nature. Organotin complexes, especially with Schiff base ligands, have been screened for their role in anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities [29].\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8874 3 of 18\nThe chemical structures of various reported organometallic complexes of flavonoids support the magnificent radical scavenging ability. Valentina Uivarosi et al. found that the metal-flavonoid complexes have enhanced the physiochemical and biological properties of flavonoids [30]. In another study, Andrea Kurzwernhart et al. reported that the organometallic complexes of flavanol scaffold employing O,O chelating ligand system seizes the in vitro anticancer activity [31]. Considering the biological importance of these compounds and the challenges due to the poor solubility of quercetin, the present study discloses the synthesis, spectral investigations, biological screening, and in silico study of diorganotin (IV) derivatives of novel Schiff base, where Schiff base is obtained from quercetin and biguanide. The results of the in silico study strongly support the potential of synthesized complexes as biocidal agent [32]."

These shifted peaks indicated the coordination of tin (IV) to the 3-hydroxyl groups of ring C [47].

All tests were carried out in triplicates. Measurements of the inhibition zones were recorded as a mean value of three readings, which are shown in Table 1. Based on the pharmacological data, it has been observed that complex three or four had positive antimicrobial activities against all the examined species with better efficacy than the antibiotics used as standard (ciprofloxacin and fluconazole). Due to the presence of azomethine linkage (>C=N-), complexes have been found to inhibit microbial growth. Different mechanisms have been suggested including the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and loss of the bioactivity of fundamental enzymes, such as dihydropteroate synthase [49,50]. In the current study, the examined ligand and their metal complexes possess strong anti-microbial activities. Promising antimicrobial activities of the metal complexes may be due to the chelation ability of the ligand [51]. As per the theory, chelation effects result in enhancement of permeability of the drug into the cytoplasm of the cell [52]. Bu2SnL and Ph2SnL derivatives have a promising antimicrobial action in contrast to ligand alone. The results indicated that phenyl by-product (4) acts as an enhanced anti-microbial agent with maximum zone of inhibition, i.e., 30 mm with MIC value of 79 ppm in evaluation to butyl by-product (29 mm and 84 ppm). This effect may be due to the delocalization of \u03c0-electrons and lipid soluble nature of tin atoms, which facilitate their entry into the microbial cells [53,54]. Therefore, upon evaluating the antimicrobial ability of the diorganotin (IV) complexes and conventional antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and fluconazole), it was found that complexes (3 & 4) have considerable activity against the tested microbes, in contrast to the antibiotics that demonstrated their use as effective antibacterial/antifungal agents.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8874 5 of 18"

            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus is widely known as a Gram-positive bacterium that is a frequent cause of life-threatening infections in hospitals, such as bacteremia, toxic shock syndrome, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, gastroenteritis, meningitis, septic arthritis, respiratory tract infections, pulmonary infections, skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, and prosthetic device infections [55,56]. Therefore, dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) was targeted for the molecular docking studies. The enzyme DHPS performs a key function in microbial folate biosynthesis through the manufacturing of 7,8-dihydropteroate from dihydropterin pyrophosphate (DHPP) and para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) [57]. The loss of the bioactivity of DHPS is suggested as one of the main mechanisms of the inhibition of microbial growth [46,47]. The X-ray crystal structure of the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) from staphylococcus aureus (1AD4) was used as a possible target for the synthetized Schiff base and its diorganotin (IV) complexes [58\u201362]. Although the synthesized ligand (H2L) displayed the strongest binding affinity (\u22129.7 kcal/mol) to the DHPS (PDB ID: 1AD4), the in vitro antimicrobial activity of H2L was determined as lower than the synthesized complexes. Consistent with the literature, quercetin\u2019s low solubility appears to suppress its extensive biocidal action [15,16]. Moreover, the synthesized Me2SnL (1) and Bu2SnL (3) showed the weakest binding properties with binding affinities of 8.4 kcal/mol (Figures 2 and 3 and Table 2), although Bu2SnL (3) was determined as one of the most effective antimicrobial agent on S.aureus with maximum zone of inhibition, i.e., 29 mm with MIC value of 84 ppm (Table 1). Therefore, it is hypothesized that Bu2SnL (3) triggers additional antimicrobial mechanisms to enhance its biocidal capacity, and should be further investigated. On the other hand, the synthesized Ph2SnL (4) was determined as the most effective complex among the synthesized complexes with binding affinity of \u22128.9 kcal/mol in correlation with in vitro experimental results (Tables 1 and 2; Figure 2).\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8874 6 of 18Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 21\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8874 7 of 18 Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 21\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8874 8 of 18\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8874 9 of 18\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8874 10 of 18\nDNA gyrase subunit B (1KZN) is considered to be a very important target for antibacterial drug design and discovery [63]. DNA gyrase is an important bacterial protein that is involved in the replication, transcription, and the catalysis of the negative supercoiling of bacterial circular DNA [64]. Therefore, the crystal structure of E. coli 24 kDa DNA gyrase fragment was used as a possible target for the synthetized Schiff base and its diorganotin (IV) complexes. Similar to the docking studies of 1AD4, the synthesized ligand (H2L) showed the strongest binding affinity (\u22129.5 kcal/mol) to the DNA gyrase subunit B, although the in vitro antimicrobial activity of H2L on E. coli was lower than the synthesized complexes (Tables 1 and 2). Additionally, it was determined that the data obtained in molecular docking studies performed with DNA gyrase (1KZN) were not compatible with the results of antimicrobial tests on E. coli. Although molecular docking studies indicated that Et2SnL (\u22129.0 kcal/mol) and Bu2SnL (\u22128.5 kcal/mol) are the most active ones among the synthesized complexes, respectively, the antimicrobial tests showed that Ph2SnL (4) and Bu2SnL (3) had respectively more antimicrobial activity on E. coli than the others (Tables 1 and 2; Figure 3). It seems that the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized complexes is not directly related to the effect on DNA gyrase enzyme. Aspergillosis is known as an invasive and potentially life-threatening infection caused by Aspergillus, and frequently observed in immunocompromised patients [65]. UDP-Nacetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP1) was reported as a potential drug target for Aspergillus fumigatus since it plays substantial roles in the biosynthesis of fungal cell wall by catalyzing the biosynthesis of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), converting UTP and GlcNAc-1P to the sugar nucleotide [66]. Therefore, the crystal structure of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (6TN3) from Aspergillus fumigatus was used as a possible target for the synthetized Schiff base and its diorganotin (IV) complexes. The molecular docking studies showed that Me2SnL, Et2SnL, and Bu2SnL have similar binding affinities to the UAP1 by \u22129.2, \u22129.2, and \u22129.1 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2 and Figure 4). Although the synthesized complexes show strong binding affinities on UAP1, their in vitro antifungal activities are not very compatible with the molecular docking results (Tables 1 and 2). For example, Ph2SnL was determined as the most effective antifungal complex among the synthesized diorganotin (IV) complexes, although its binding affinity was determined as the weakest one (\u22127.3 kcal/mol). Consequently, it is clear that there is a need to further investigate alternative drug targets in order to fully understand the antimicrobial activity mechanisms of the synthesized complexes, and it should be noted that there are complicated biological and chemical processes for the emergence of antimicrobial activities of drugs.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8874 11 of 18Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 21\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8874 12 of 18"

The S. aureus (MTCC 9760) and B. subtillis (MTCC 1133), E. coli (MTCC 589) and P. aeruginosa (MTCC 9048), A. niger (MTCC 9933), and S. canadensis (MTCC 567) microbial Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal traces, respectively were procured from IMTECH Chandigarh.\n3.1.1. Synthesis of Ligand (H2L)\nA 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask and magnetic stirrer with hot plate were used to synthesize the compounds. Briefly, 2 mol quercetin. 2H2O was dissolved in 100 mL MeOH. The content was stirred for 20 min to yield a clear, dark, yellow solution. Next, 1 mol biguanide methanolic solution was dropwise added to the same flask until a yellow color was observed. Thereafter, the content was refluxed by non-stop stirring for approximately 3 h, and then stirring at room temperature for approximately 4 h. The content was maintained in a rotary vacuum evaporator until the complete evaporation of the solvent resulted in a yellow product. Finally, the obtained product was dried and subjected to spectroscopic and other studies.

This activity has been evaluated using serial dilution and agar well diffusion technique [68]. The antibacterial activity was measured against Gram-positive species, such as Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 9760), Bacillus subtillis (MTCC 1133), and Gram-negative strains, i.e., Escherichia coli (MTCC 589), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 9048). The antifungal activity was carried out against fungal species, such as Scopulariopsis canadensis (MTCC 567) and Aspergillus niger (MTCC 9933). Ciprofloxacin and fluconazole were used as standard antimicrobials to compare the activities of tested compounds while 2% DMSO was used as a blank. The solutions were prepared by dissolving 5 mg of each compound in 5 mL of 2% DMSO as solvent. Then, 1 mL of the prepared solution was diluted with 9 mL of DMSO for the concentration of the solution to reach a value of up to 100 ppm [69,70]."

The eight flavonoid hydroxyl groups present at 11, 12, 16, and 18th and 32, 33, 37, and 39th positions of each complex are responsible for anti-oxidative properties. Four >C=N bonds present at 6, 27, 43, and 46th positions provide excellent biocidal properties, whereas the double bonds present between the 4th and 5th positions and 25th and 26th positions of bi-flavonoid moiety are responsible for effective inhibitory activities [75]. Furthermore, complexation of Schiff base with organotin (IV) increases the biocidal potential of complex, which is possibly due to the increase in lipophilic character."

            "text": "The current research involved the synthesis of novel, Schiff base ligand using quercetin and biguanide as initial materials. In the subsequent step, diorganotin (IV) complexes of the designed Schiff base ligand were synthesized. The spectroscopic records confirmed that the oxygen atom of the 3-OH group and imine nitrogen atoms are coordination sites for central tin atom, which result in the formation of penta-coordinated complexes. Antimicrobial screening displayed that the diorganotin (IV) complexes have greater inhibition potential than the Schiff base ligand, which may be due to the increase in lipophilicity and permeability through the cell membrane following the formation of complexes. The excessive lipid solubility of organotin compounds ensures better cell penetration and interaction with intercellular sites. Furthermore, the molecular docking proved that the complex formed in the case of 4 was the most effective agent as an antimicrobial along with the substantial interactions with DHPS (1AD4) receptor protein.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27248874/s1, Figure S1: 1H NMR Spectra of H2L; Figure S2: IR Spectra of H2L; Figure S3: anti-bacterial activities of quercetin complexes; Figure S4: anti-bacterial activities of quercetin ligand (Schiff base).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.A. and M.K.; methodology, Z.A., H.S.T. and E.M.J.; software, M.V.; validation, S.H.
