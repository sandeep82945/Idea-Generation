Considering the convenient availability of digital painting images and the straightforward calculation algorithm of this measurement, we expect its wide application in future research.

Further research is warranted for this color-emotion-investment transmission mechanism.

How this multidimensional information interacts with each other to influence art pricing also calls for further studies.

Whether the effect of colors on art pricing is sensitive to the choice of color models also needs further studies.

Also, we can investigate the information in three-dimensional artworks, such as sculptures and porcelains, so as to improve their pricing models.
