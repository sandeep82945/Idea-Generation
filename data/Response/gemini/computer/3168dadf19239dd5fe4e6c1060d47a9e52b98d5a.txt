1. **Investigate the potential of using qualitative COVID-19 biomarkers for improved disease detection.** Most research to date has focused on quantitative biomarkers, but qualitative biomarkers may provide additional specificity and accuracy in diagnosing COVID-19.


2. **Develop e-nose devices with improved sensor arrays specifically tailored to detect COVID-19 biomarkers.** Current e-nose devices often have sensor arrays that are not optimized for detecting COVID-19-specific VOCs. By designing sensor arrays with sensors that are specifically sensitive to these biomarkers, the accuracy and sensitivity of e-nose devices could be significantly improved.


3. **Explore the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to enhance the performance of e-nose devices for COVID-19 detection.** Machine learning and AI algorithms can be used to analyze the complex data generated by e-nose devices and identify patterns that are associated with COVID-19 infection. This could help to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of e-nose devices, particularly in cases where the VOC profile of COVID-19 is similar to that of other respiratory diseases.


4. **Conduct longitudinal studies to investigate the changes in VOC profiles over the course of COVID-19 infection and recovery.** This information could be used to develop e-nose devices that can not only detect COVID-19 infection but also monitor the progression of the disease and assess the effectiveness of treatments.


5. **Evaluate the potential of e-nose devices for detecting COVID-19 in different populations and settings.** Most studies to date have been conducted in hospital settings with patients who have moderate to severe COVID-19. It is important to evaluate the performance of e-nose devices in different populations, such as asymptomatic individuals and those with mild disease, as well as in different settings, such as schools, workplaces, and public transportation.
