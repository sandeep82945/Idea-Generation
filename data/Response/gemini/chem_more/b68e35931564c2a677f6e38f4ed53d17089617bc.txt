1. **Investigate the role of apoptosis in the release of cTn molecules from MCs in different pathological conditions.** This could help to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of MI and other CVDs.
2. **Determine the mechanisms by which cTn molecules are released from MCs during myocardial distension and overload.** This could lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HF and other conditions that cause myocardial stress.
3. **Study the role of proteolytic enzymes in the cleavage of cTn molecules and the release of cTn fragments from MCs.** This could help to identify new biomarkers for MI and other CVDs, as well as new therapeutic targets for the treatment of these conditions.
4. **Investigate the diurnal rhythm of cTn levels in different populations and determine the factors that influence this rhythm.** This could help to optimize the timing of blood draws for cTn testing and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis.
5. **Develop new high-sensitivity troponin immunoassays that are not affected by the different cTn molecules and their fragments, as well as oxidized and phosphorylated derivatives.** This could improve the accuracy and reliability of cTn testing for the diagnosis of MI and other CVDs.
