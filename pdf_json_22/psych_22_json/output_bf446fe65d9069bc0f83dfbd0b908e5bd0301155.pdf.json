Suffering from\nPTSD not only decreases stroke patient\u2019s quality of life, but also relates to\ntheir non-adherence of treatment. Since strokes often recur and progress,\nlong-term medical management is especially important. However, previous\nstudies generally focused on the epidemiological characteristics of post-\nstroke PTSD, while there are literally no studies on the psychological\nintervention. In our study, 170 patients with a first-ever stroke during the acute\nphase were recruited. They were randomized into Psycho-therapy group 1\nand Control group 1, and were administered with preventive intervention\nfor PTSD or routine health education, respectively. At 2-month follow-up,\nPTSD symptoms were evaluated. Participants who were diagnosed with\npost-stroke PTSD were further randomized into Psycho-therapy group 2\nand Control group 2, and received supportive therapy or routine health counseling, respectively. At 6-month follow-up (1\u25e6month after the therapy\nwas completed), PTSD symptoms were re-evaluated. Our results showed that\nat 2-month, the PTSD incidence in our series was 11.69%, and the severity\nof stroke was the only risk factor for PTSD development. The preventive\nintervention was not superior to routine health education for PTSD prevention.\nAt 6-month, results indicated the supportive therapy did have a fine effect\nin ameliorating symptoms for diagnosed PTSD patients, superior to routine\nhealth counseling. Thus, our study was the first to provide evidence that\nthe supportive therapy was effective in treating post-stroke PTSD early\nafter its diagnosis. This clinical trial was preregistered on www.chictr.org.cn\n(ChiCTR2100048411).\nKEYWORDS\nstroke, post-traumatic stress-disorder, psychological intervention, supportive therapy, early stage\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder which may develop after individuals exposed to traumatic events. The common events include accidents, combat, physical attack, childhood abuse, robbery, natural disasters, and so on. According to the Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-version 5 (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013), PTSD is characterized by four clusters of symptoms including persistent intrusive memories, avoidance of reminders, negative alterations in mood and cognition, and hyper-arousal (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). PTSD is also associated with increased risk of drug abuse, suicide, and other mental disorders (Kessler et al., 1995). In the general population, the lifetime incidence of trauma exposure is estimated to be over 50%, and the incidence of PTSD to be 3\u20137% (McManus et al., 2007; Kessler et al., 2017).\nStroke presents one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide (B\u00e9jot et al., 2016). Secondary psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety commonly occur (Towfighi et al., 2017). Stroke features sudden onset of neurologic deficits and is potentially life-threatening, thus conforms to the definition of traumatic events in posttraumatic disorder (PTSD). Emerging studies have focused on post-stroke PTSD in the past two decades. The prevalence of PTSD (or PTSD symptom) in stroke population ranged from 4 to 37% (Garton et al., 2017), and even mild stroke (Bruggimann et al., 2006) and transient ischemic stroke (TIA) (Kiphuth et al., 2014) can cause PTSD. Since strokes often recur and progress, long-term medical management is especially important. Suffering from PTSD not only decreases stroke patient\u2019s quality of life (QOL) (Noble et al., 2008), but also relates to their non-adherence of treatment (Kronish et al., 2012; Edmondson et al., 2013a).\nPsychotherapies for prevention or treatment of PTSD primarily include exposure therapy, cognitive processing therapy (CPT), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). After treatment, although most patients can attain clinically meaningful symptom improvement, approximately two-thirds retained PTSD diagnosis (Maria et al., 2015). On the other hand, there are also pharmacotherapeutic ways for the management of PTSD, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines (Akhtar and Pilkhwal Sah, 2021). Yet, they showed limited efficacy, excessive adverse effects, and lower patient compliance. As for post-stroke PTSD, previous studies generally focused on the rate and risk factors, while there are literally no studies on its prevention or treatment (Garton et al., 2017). Compared with PTSD caused by non-medical factors, post-stroke PTSD has its unique pathophysiological\ncharacteristics and may require different psychological therapies.\nWithin the first 3\u25e6months of a traumatic event, the traumatic memory remains fragmented (Van der Kolk, 1994; Foa et al., 2010; Shapiro, 2012). Early psychological intervention conducted during this period may keep these memories from accumulation (McFarlene, 2010), so it is crucial for the prevention and treatment of PTSD. Thus, our study focused on the early psychological intervention for the prevention and treatment of post-stroke PTSD. It is argued that stroke patients\u2019 maladaptive coping strategies and their exaggerated belief of stroke\u2019s harmfulness may be the main cause for PTSD. Therefore, extended health education in the acute stage of the stroke, guiding patients to adopt suitable coping styles, and correctly understand the risk of stroke seems likely to help prevent secondary PTSD (Noble et al., 2008; Kiphuth et al., 2014). As for the treatment of post-stroke PTSD, we hypothesized that supportive therapy with medical counseling implemented early after the PTSD diagnosis may be effective. In our prospective clinical trial, we showed the efficacy of supportive therapy, but not extended health education."

More participants were unemployed, had lower income, and have no religion. Cerebral infarction represented the most common type of stroke and the severity of stroke was generally mild.

The overall duration of preventive intervention of PTSD was significantly longer than the normal health education (2.19 \u00b1 0.75 h vs. 0.85 \u00b1 0.39 h, P < 0.001), while it did not increase non-adherence of participants.\nAt 2-month follow-up, 18 of the 154 participants (11.69%) were diagnosed with PTSD. Patients diagnosed with PTSD showed significantly higher NIHSS scores (more severe neurological deficits) than those without PTSD (6.17 \u00b1 4.42 vs. 1.90 \u00b1 2.36, P < 0.001).

We proved that the supportive therapy has a fine effect in treating post-stroke PTSD early after its diagnosis and it is well tolerated by patients. We also showed that the strengthened health education during the acute phase of stroke may not have a preventive effect of PTSD compared with normal health education.\nEpidemiology and risk factors of post-stroke post-traumatic stress disorder\nThe diagnosis of PTSD should be obtained with strict clinical interviews, while self-reported scales can only report probable PTSD of PTSD-like symptoms (PTSS). Most previous studies used only self-reported scales but lacked interviews. These studies report conflicting rates, from 4% to as high as 37% (Bruggimann et al., 2006). A meta-analysis in 2013 revealed the estimated rate of PTSD/PTSS following stroke or TIA was 23% within 1 year and 11% after 1 year (Edmondson et al., 2013b). Some more recent studies showed relatively lower rate: 7.5% within the first 5 days after ictus (Edmondson et al., 2013b), 10% (Pedowitz et al., 2021) or 11.0% at one month (Liyanage-Don et al., 2021), 12.9% at 3 months (Rutovic et al., 2021), 6.5% (Garton et al., 2020) or 11% (Assayag et al., 2022) at 12 months, although one reported as high as 32.8% at 3 months to 5 years follow-up (Dollenberg et al., 2021). The discrepancies between various studies may be partially explained by heterogeneity in study methodology (e.g., subtypes of stroke, first-ever or recurrent"

Patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment usually could not be fully aware of the risk of stroke despite repeated explanations by medical staffs, so they consequently experienced little stress, even less than their family members. It is of note that the proportion of this population is not low (nearly equal to the included population), but was all excluded from our study, which may lead to the overestimation of PTSD incidence. If this population was included, the actual incidence of post-stroke PTSD in our series may very likely to be no more than 6%. In the future, the relationship between cognitive impairment and PTSD development is needed to be revealed and epidemiological studies should clarify patients to what extent of cognitive impairment (e.g., measured by scales like Montreal Cognitive Assessment) are excluded.\nAnother important methodological factor we propose that potentially influence the PTSD incidence is the way of health education: the more serious the medical staffs informed about strokes, the more distressed felt by patients and their family members. So, it is a test of communication skills to properly inform the risk of strokes to the patients while not to increase their psychologic burden.\nIt has been consistently shown that higher degree of stroke disability is positively correlated with both acute distress and PTSD symptoms (Garton et al., 2020; Pedowitz et al., 2021; Rutovic et al., 2021; Assayag et al., 2022). Other potential risk factors include lesions localized in the right cerebral hemisphere and brain stem (Rutovic et al., 2021), white matter damage (Assayag et al., 2022), minimally invasive surgery (Jiang, 2020), younger age, female sex, dysfunctional coping strategies, negative cognitive appraisals, lower education and unemployment status, uninsured status, etc. (Garton et al., 2017). However, a definitive consensus has yet been reached. Our present study showed only stroke severity predicted PTSD development, indicating somatic disability to be a strong risk factor.\nPreventive intervention for post-stroke post-traumatic stress disorder\nThere are various therapies developed for the prevention of PTSD in adults. Yet, as reviewed in an article including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there lacks evidence for any intervention that can be strongly recommended for PTSD prevention (Bisson et al., 2021). Attention bias modification training, as a way of pre-incident preparedness, showed effects (Wald et al., 2016). After traumatic events happen, interventions like eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) (Jarero et al., 2011; Tarquinio et al., 2016), individual/group psychological debriefing, brief individual trauma processing therapies, and trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be helpful (Bisson et al., 2021). A small proportion of these studies focused on acute medical conditions such as premature delivery (Shaw et al., 2013; Borghini et al., 2014), miscarriage (Lee et al., 1996), caesarian section (Horsch et al., 2017), myocardial infarction (von K\u00e4nel et al., 2018), mechanical ventilation in ICU (Jensen et al., 2016; Cox et al., 2018) or ICU stay (Jones et al., 2010), family members of patients (Kazak et al., 2005; Curtis et al., 2016), and transplant surgery (Irvine et al., 2011). However, no effective therapy was found in these studies, except for one favored brief individual trauma processing therapy on traumatic childbirth (Gamble et al., 2005). Another review showed evidence that midwifery or clinician led early psychological interventions (including CBT counseling, debriefing, EMDR, visual spatial tasks, etc.) administered within 72 h after childbirth to be more effective than usual care (Miller et al., 2021).\nBesides behavior ways, various pharmacological agents like hydrocortisone (Bisson et al., 2021), SSRIs and anticonvulsants (Akhtar and Pilkhwal Sah, 2021) may be helpful in the management PTSD symptoms. However, due to the limited evidence and their adverse effects, they cannot be recommended for routine use of PTSD prevention (Astill Wright et al., 2019).\nOur preventive therapy is the combination of health education and debriefing counseling. The treatment strength was comparable to previous therapies on patients with traumatic childbirth which is commonly 1 or 2 sessions (40 to 60 min\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 07 frontiersin.org\nfor each session). We did not find a superiority of our preventive therapy over routine health education. Combined with previous studies, it may indicate that the prevention of PTSD is relatively difficult, or, preventive interventions would be better to be selectively delivered to individuals who have developed symptoms, since they are likely to benefit more from the interventions (Bisson et al., 2021). Considering stroke patient\u2019s tolerance, the duration of our preventive intervention is long enough, and it is not likely to improve the therapeutic efficacy by simply increasing time length. Future studies may be better focused on therapies based on other mechanisms. As stated above, the actual incidence of post-stroke PTSD in our hospital is relatively low. Thus, another possibility which we believed more is that the routine health education administered in the control group also exerted preventive effects. Besides explaining the state of stroke illness to patients and their caretakers by doctors and nurses irregularly, we offered a group education once a week, which contains lectures given by doctors and interactions between doctors and patients. So, a clear knowledge of the stroke disease can be achieved by this kind to health education. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic, our department generally required every patient to be accompanied by one family member during hospitalization (Simnani et al., 2022). The caring of family members can offer great comfort to the patients. With this kind of health education and family caring, patients are probably more resistant to mental disorders.\nPsychotherapy for the treatment of post-stroke post-traumatic stress disorder\nTraditional behavioral therapies for PTSD include exposure therapy, CBT, EMDR, cognitive processing therapy (CPT), etc. Although these therapies can reduce PTSD symptoms, there are still 1/3 (Kessler et al., 1995) to 2/3 (Steenkamp et al., 2015) patients left with PTSD diagnosis after treatment.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after stroke and PTSD caused by non-medical factors have different pathophysiological characteristics. The former is affected by brain lesions, while the latter lacks a clear physiological precipitant (Garton et al., 2017). The traumatic focal points of stroke are often the uncertainty about future health, fear of recurrent attacks, disability, and changes of social status (McCurley et al., 2019). Stroke patients are commonly middle and old aged, and often have various comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes. Additionally, patients generally need to take medications for a long period of time, which serve as a traumatic reminder (Liyanage-Don et al., 2021). Exposure therapy is considered as the first-line treatment\nfor PTSD caused by various types of traumas (Rauch et al., 2012); however, it may not be adequate for post-stroke PTSD. Because exposure therapy takes effect through repeated confrontations of trauma-related stimuli but without the occurrence of feared consequences, by which the patient is habituated to emotional responses and regains self-competence. In contrast, different from other types of traumas, stroke does have the potential to recur and worsen, threatening individual\u2019s life. So, a treatment aiming at help post-stroke PTSD patients establish a correct understanding of disease, adapt to new environment, and offers comfort may be a better choice.\nIt seems that the features mentioned above of post-stroke PTSD make patients persistently reminded of the traumatic events and affected by unfavorable outcomes of stroke. These may be adverse factors for treatment efficacy. However, our study showed that the 12-session supportive therapy had a fine effect, with 75% of post-stroke PTSD patients being ameliorated at 1\u25e6month after therapy completion. In some cases, even nine sessions of intervention showed favorable therapeutic effects. The favorable outcome may be partly due to the relatively old age of stroke patients. Older age is a protective factor for developing PTSD, as found by some previous studies (Garton et al., 2017). Likewise, older patients with PTSD may be more prone to accept unfavorable situations after psychological therapy. Another reason lies in the way our supportive therapy administered to patients. The majority of treatment sessions were delivered through video chat on smartphones or laptops. Multiple studies reported noninferiority of online-based psychotherapy, which is far more convenient and cost-effective than in vivo methods (Spence et al., 2014; Littleton et al., 2016; Nieminen et al., 2016; Lewis et al., 2017; Olden et al., 2017). We believe that the online interaction is good for establishing trust and intimacy between patients and therapists, since the patients can readily get answers to the problems relating to their illnesses through communicating with therapists.\nThere are some limitations of our study. Firstly, it should be noted that we only followed for 1\u25e6month after the treatment for PTSD, so the long-term effect is unknown and requires further study. Secondly, since the brain lesions varied in our stroke patient sample, which may potentially affect the PTSD pathophysiology, it is more desirable to include stroke patients with lesions in similar brain regions. Thirdly, as the development of PTSD is influenced by social and cultural background, it should be cautious when translating our results to populations of different countries. Finally, whether shorter treatment sessions can also achieve desirable effects remains to be revealed.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org"
