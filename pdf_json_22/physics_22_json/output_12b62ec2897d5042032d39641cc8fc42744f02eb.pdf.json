One lass of objects where magnetic fields have been very hard to observe nd study is globular cluster (GC). There is very limited evidence of ntracluster medium within GCs (Smith et al. 1990 ; van Loon et al. 006 ; Barmby et al. 2009 ). For this reason traditional techniques to etect magnetic fields like synchrotron emission or rotation measure RM) from the gas are not ef fecti ve. The limited number of studies hat have focused on the magnetic fields towards GCs (Abbate et al. 020 ; Martsen et al. 2022 ) used information derived from pulsars. Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that emit highly linearly polarized adiation across the radio spectrum. The radio waves from pulsars robe the intervening matter and its magnetic field between the Earth nd the pulsar via two effects: the frequency-dependent rotation of the lane of linear polarization, quantified by the RM and a frequency-\nE-mail: abbate@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de\ne i p a\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Socie Commons Attribution License ( https://cr eativecommons.or g/licenses/by/4.0/), whi\nependent dispersion of the radio light, quantified by the dispersion easure (DM).

The detection of an internal magnetic eld would allow us to test which amplification mechanisms are ctive in these environments. A magnetic field could also influence he searches for radiative signatures of intermediate-mass black holes IMBH) in GCs (Tremou et al. 2018 ). The magnetic field could affect he accretion rate of the gas on the black hole (Cunningham et al. 012 ) and, therefore, also the derived mass limits for the IMBH. A first attempt to observe the magnetic field of 47 Tuc via its ulsars, using observations from the Parkes radio telescope (Abbate t al. 2020 ), showed the detection of a large gradient in the measured Ms associated with the cluster. The authors attributed it to a ossible interaction between the GC and an outflow from the Galactic isc. We refute the presence of the gradient by measuring the RM sing significantly more sensitive data from the MeerKAT radio elescope (Jonas & MeerKAT Team 2016 ; Camilo et al. 2018 ). This luster has been repeatedly observed by the large survey projects eerTime 2 (Bailes et al. 2016 , 2020 ) and TRansients And PUlsars ith MeerKAT (TRAPUM; (Stappers & Kramer 2016 ). 3 A long bservational campaign of 23 h o v er 3 d from 2022 January 26 to anuary 29 and an additional observation of 2 h on 2022 June 9 ave been performed on this cluster with the UHF receivers over frequency range of 544\u20131088 MHz. The lower central frequency, arger fractional bandwidth, and increased sensitivity allowed us to etermine RM values for 22 pulsars compared to 13 in the earlier ork and with uncertainties on average \u223c20 times smaller.\nOBSERVATIONS\nhe GC 47 Tuc was the target of an e xtensiv e observational campaign rom 2022 January 26 to January 29 with the MeerKAT radio elescope in South Africa with the UHF receivers over a frequency ange of 544\u20131088 MHz. The observations lasted a total of 23 h ivided in the following way: 2 h on January 26, 17 h on January 27, h on January 28, and 2 h on January 29. An additional observation f 47 Tuc was performed on 2022 June 9 lasting 2 h. The campaign made use of the PTUSE (Pulsar Timing User upplied Equipment) machines (Bailes et al. 2020 ) and their ability to ynthesize four different tied-array beams to observe different parts f the cluster simultaneously. One beam was pointed at pulsar 47Tuc and recorded data in timing mode. A second beam, also in timing ode, was pointed at pulsar 47Tuc X for the observation in the first ay and then was repointed towards pulsar 47Tuc Q. A third beam as pointed tow ards the centre of the cluster to co v er the majority of he pulsars and recorded data in search mode. Finally, the last beam as pointed between pulsars 47Tuc H and 47Tuc U and recorded ata in search mode. In the observation on 2022 June 9, three beams ere set in timing mode pointed at pulsars 47Tuc E, 47Tuc J, and 7Tuc AA. The last beam was pointed at the centre of the cluster and ecorded data in search mode. Fig. 1 shows the position and shape of he two search beams as they change during the long observation on 022 January 27. Some of the pulsars further away from the centre re co v ered only partially and for short periods of time. In case of\nCurrently the second highest pulsar count within GCs with 29 known pulsars. or a complete list of the pulsars in 47 Tuc, see http:// www.naic.edu/ \u223cpfrei e/GCpsr.html and the references listed there. http://www.meertime.org http://www.trapum.org\n(\n4\n5\n6\n7\neak pulsars or pulsars with low linear polarization percentage, like 7Tuc J and 47Tuc AA, the precision of the RM was impacted. In rder to get a more precise value, in the observation on 2022 June 9, e pointed a beam in timing mode using all of the available antennas n both of them. All the beams were initially observed with 4096 frequency hannels and coherently dedispersed at the value reported in Table 1 . he number of frequency channels of the beams recorded in search ode was reduced on-the-fly by a factor of 16 and only 256 channels ere recorded. The number of antennas, sampling time, number of channels, and alue of DM used for dedispersion are reported for each beam in able 1 . The number of antennas used for the timing beams changed uring the campaign based on their availability. For the search beams, he number of antennas was reduced in order to increase the field of iew and thus co v er a larger area of the cluster. Using simulations f the size and orientation of the beams as they evolved during the bserv ation, we deri ved an optimal number of antennas to use in order o observe the largest number of pulsars. All of the observations were ecorded in full-Stokes so as to reco v er the polarimetric information.\nAll the pulsars, with the exception of 47Tuc E, 47Tuc Q, and 47Tuc , were folded from the data of both beams recorded in search mode sing the DSPSR 4 pulsar package (van Straten & Bailes 2011 ). For ach pulsar, we examined the folds in both search-mode beams and ept the one with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).\nThe polarization calibration of pulsar observations at MeerKAT is escribed in Serylak et al. ( 2021 ). This consists of observations of a ell-known calibrator (either PKS J0408 \u22126545, PKS J0825 \u22125010, r PKS J1939 \u22126342 depending on which one is abo v e the horizon) nd of noise diodes in order to obtain the correct delays and orrections for the two polarizations. During the long observation on 022 January 27, we repeated the calibration process every 4\u20135 h in rder to maintain a good calibration solution. After the observations ere taken, we used the routine pac from PSRCHIVE 5 (Hotan, an Straten & Manchester 2004 ; van Straten, Demorest & Oslowski 012 ) to correct for the variations of the parallactic angle. About per cent of the channels in the UHF band at MeerKAT are affected y radio frequency interference. We remo v ed the affected channels sing the paz routine of PSRCHIVE . Using the calibrated and cleaned data, we checked if the phemerides used for folding were correct. In a few pulsars, we ould see some drifting of the pulse profile in time. In these cases, e extracted times of arri v als (ToAs) using the pat routine of SRCHIVE and found a local timing solution that remo v ed the rift using TEMPO2 6 (Hobbs, Edwards & Manchester 2006 ). For the ulsars that showed eclipses during the observations, we remo v ed the rbital phase close to the eclipse since they could impact the linear olarization percentage and the value of RM (Li et al. 2022 ). A preliminary measure of the RM of the brightest pulsars using the mfit routine of PSRCHIVE suggested that the errors on the RM ould be as low as 0.1 rad m \u22122 . Because of this precision, we were ble to see an increase of RM during the day and a decrease during he night by about 0.5\u20131 rad m \u22122 . These are likely caused by the aily variability of the ionosphere (Porayko et al. 2019 ). The extent f this effect can be predicted using the software RMextract 7 Mevius 2018 ). This software estimates the ionospheric RM at a\nMNRAS 518, 1642\u20131655 (2023)\nht tp://dspsr.sourceforge.net ht tp://psrchive.sourceforge.net https:// bitbucket.org/ psrsoft/ tempo2/ ht tps://github.com/lofar-ast ron/RMextract\nM\nFigure 1.

We applied these corrections to he data using the routine pam of PSRCHIVE . This was enough o remo v e all the variability in the estimates of RM throughout he observation. Finally, we summed all the observations together sing the routine psradd of PSRCHIVE to create a single timeveraged profile of each pulsar with full polarization and frequency nformation.\nWe used these profiles to estimate the values of DM for each ulsar. We created one-dimensional (1D) analytic templates from the\nNRAS 518, 1642\u20131655 (2023)\nhttps:// www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ geomag/WMM/DoDWMM.shtml https:// www.aiub.unibe.ch/ research/code analysis center/ index eng.html\np l f d\nrequenc y-av eraged profiles using the paas routine of PSRCHIVE . e reduced the number of frequency channels to 16 and extracted oAs for each channel using pat . We performed a fit of DM leaving ll other parameters fixed in tempo2 .\nThe RMs were measured in two steps. We first looked at the ercentage of linear polarization of the pulsars. An uncorrected M will cause the polarization position angle to rotate by an angle ependant on the square of the wavelength. This rotation will reduce he degree of linear polarization of the pulsar. We applied different alues of RM to the data in order to search for the value that aximizes linear polarization. We searched in the range [ \u2212100,100] ad m \u22122 with a step size of 0.5 rad m \u22122 to account for the range f values measured in Abbate et al. ( 2020 ). This method has the dvantage of being unbiased o v er a large range of RM and is ery ef fecti ve in the case of pulsars where the linear polarization ercentages can be very high. Ho we ver, the uncertainties are quite arge. To find a better estimate of the errors, we corrected the data or this value of RM and we mo v ed on to the second method.

The measure of the value and error of the position ngle for each frequency channel follows the prescriptions described n Noutsos et al. ( 2008 ), Tiburzi et al. ( 2013 ), and Abbate et al. 2020 ). In the cases where the position angle changes significantly hroughout the pulse profile or shows jumps of 90 deg, we divided he pulse into different regions and performed a simultaneous fit f RM allowing the different regions to have different values f 0 . As a check of the quality of the fit we also used the routine rmfit o obtain a measure of RM. The different routines returned values ompatible within the uncertainties. As can be seen in Fig. 1 , many of the pulsars were not in the entre of the beam but were observed off-axis. We checked that this oes not introduce any bias in the determination of RM by folding a election of pulsars detected in more than one beam and comparing he RMs. These values are compatible within the uncertainties. We an therefore conclude that the values of RM determined are accurate ithin the reported uncertainties. Despite being only 2-h long, the additional observation on 2022\nune 9 was essential to reco v er accurate RM measurements for 47Tuc and 47Tuc AA. Both these pulsars are located far from the centre f the cluster and thus only a fraction of their signal was picked up y the search mode beams on the long campaign. The S/N of these ulsars from the observation on 2022 June 9, that used two beams n timing mode pointed at these pulsars, was greater than the value btained from the entire long campaign on 2022 January 26\u201329. he S/N of pulsar 47Tuc J increased by a factor of five while for ulsar 47Tuc AA the impro v ement was a factor of two. For the other ulsars located at similar distance, like 47Tuc C and 47Tuc M, we\nere already capable of determining a precise RM from the long ampaign.\nRESULTS\nf the 23 pulsars in 47 Tuc with known timing solutions (Pan t al. 2016 ; Ridolfi et al. 2016 ; Freire et al. 2017 ), 22 pulsars were etected in the observations and for all of them we were able to etermine the DM and RM. The polarization profiles of the pulsars re shown in Fig. 2 . These are obtained correcting each pulsar with he best-fitting RM.\nThe results for DM and RM are shown in Table 2 . A map showing he positions and values of RM for each pulsar is shown in Fig. 3 . The Ms have an average value of 26.2 rad m \u22122 and a standard deviation f 0.9 rad m \u22122 ; ho we v er, the av erage error is 0.3 rad m \u22122 . While he values are not consistent with a single value of RM, the spread s much smaller than previously measured (Abbate et al. 2020 ). To heck the reason for this discrepancy, we recovered the original data sed in Abbate et al. ( 2020 ) and tried to remeasure the RM using he current method. For all pulsars except 47Tuc J, we reco v ered alues compatible with the values from MeerKAT and not indicative f any gradient. The details of the comparison are reported in the ppendix A .\nELECTRO N DENSITY C O N S I D E R AT I O N S\nhe high precision of the values of DM of the pulsars allows us to erform a more detailed analysis of the gas density distribution along he line of sight in the Galactic disc and in the cluster. We check for he presence of turbulence by looking at the second-order structure unction (SF, Minter & Spangler 1996 ; Haverkorn et al. 2008 ). The M SF is defined as\nDM ( \u03b4\u03b8 ) = \u2329 [ DM ( u) \u2212 DM ( v)] 2 \u232a , (4)\nMNRAS 518, 1642\u20131655 (2023)\nM\nw s t t s\ns S\nt a\nnras/article/518/2/1642/6824449 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nhere u is the position of one source, v is the position of a second ource with angular separation of \u03b4\u03b8 , and the angle brackets mean he average between all pairs with the same angular separation. In he case of a turbulent medium, we expect the SF to follow either a ingle power law or a broken power law in case the energy injection\nNRAS 518, 1642\u20131655 (2023)\ncale is within the range of observed angular separations (Minter & pangler 1996 ; Lazarian & Pogosyan 2016 ). To measure the DM SF of the pulsars in 47 Tuc we first estimate he square difference of all DM pairs. We then sort the pairs as function of angular separation and group the 231 pairs (obtained\nf o s m p t\nb m\nt t a\nnras/article/518/2/1642/6824449 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nrom the 22 pulsars) together in 10 bins containing each 21 pairs plus ne bin containing the 21 pairs involving 47Tuc X. Since the angular eparations between this pulsar and the cluster centre ( \u223c220 arcsec) is ore than twice the maximum angular separation between any other air ( \u223c100 arcsec), we cannot assume its value is representative of he DM at this location. The value and the error of the SF for each\nin is measured by taking the mean and the standard deviation of the ean with a Monte Carlo method. We report the DM SF in Fig. 4 . We further verify the statistical significance of the SF by simulating he effects of the white noise.

We perform a fit to the data with both a single power law and a roken power law shown in the plot as the dashed green line and the lled orange line excluding the pairs involving 47Tuc X. The fits are ased on the Monte Carlo Markov Chain code emcee (Foremanackey et al. 2013 ). In case of the single power-law fit, the free arameters are the power-law index and the value of the SF at a eparation of 1 arcsec. In the case of the broken power-law fit, the ree parameters are: the position of the break, the power-law indices efore and after the break, and the value of the SF at the break. We sed a flat prior on the position of the break between the shortest and he largest angular separation; ho we ver, for the po wer-law indices, e used a flat prior between \u22121.5 and 3.5. We also imposed that he power-law index after the break must be smaller than the value efore the break. In the case of the broken power-law fit, the 68 per cent confidence nterval of the power-la w inde x before the break is 2 . 3 + 0 . 5 \u22120 . 3 , for the ower-la w inde x after the break it is \u22120 . 3 + 0 . 3 \u22120 . 3 , for the position of he break it is 28 + 4 \u22127 arcsec, and for the value at the break it is . 07 + 0 . 01 \u22120 . 01 pc\n2 cm \u22126 . In the case of the single power law, the 68 per cent onfidence interval of the power-law index is 0 . 8 + 0 . 1 \u22120 . 1 and for the value\nNRAS 518, 1642\u20131655 (2023)\nt 1 arcsec it is 0 . 002 + 0 . 001 \u22120 . 001 pc 2 cm \u22126 . We performed an F -test and ound a p -value for the single power law of only 0.02. This value is ower than the threshold of 0.05, so we can reject the hypothesis that he data can be described by a single power law.\nAccording to the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence, the presence f a break in the SF could be linked to the energy injection scale f the turbulence (Minter & Spangler 1996 ; Lazarian & Pogosyan 016 ). Previous works have suggested that most of the variations in M between the pulsars are caused by the ionized gas located inside he cluster (Freire et al. 2001 ; Abbate et al. 2018 ). This suggests hat the turbulence is located within the GC itself. At a distance of\n4.5 kpc (Baumgardt & Vasiliev 2021 ), the angular scale of the reak corresponds to a physical size of 0 . 61 + 0 . 09 \u22120 . 15 pc.\n.1 Predictions for the turbulence inside 47 Tuc\ne look in more details at the possible causes and expected values or turbulence in the gas in 47 Tuc. The gas is thought to originate rom the winds of evolved red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic iant branch (AGB) stars (McDonald & Zijlstra 2015 ).

The random motion of wind-shedding stars in the cluster can e a source of turbulent energy in the gas of the cluster (Moss & hukurov 1996 ). In this case, the energy injection scale would be he maximum scale at which the gas is deposited in the cluster. e determine it by balancing the ram pressure of the wind and the mbient medium (Baranov, Krasnobaev & K uliko vskii 1971 ) using he equation \u03c1w V 2 w = \u03c1GC V 2 \u2217 , where \u03c1w is the density of the wind, w is the velocity of the wind, \u03c1GC is the mass density of the gas n the GC, and V \u2217 is the velocity of the RGB stars with respect to he ambient medium. The av erage v elocity of the stars within the alf-mass radius, \u223c6 pc (Baumgardt & Hilker 2018 ), in the cluster is 20 km s \u22121 , obtained from the 1D velocity dispersion (Baumgardt & ilker 2018 ) and the radial dependence of velocity dispersion in a ing profile (equations 6 and 7 of Abbate et al. 2018 ). The density f the wind depends on the mass-loss rate M\u0307 , the energy injection cale R 0 , and the velocity of the wind with the following relation: w = M\u0307 / (4 \u03c0R 2 0 v w ). Solving the equation for the energy injection cale we obtain 0 = \u221a M\u0307 v w 4 \u03c0\u03c1GC v 2 \u2217 . (5)\nThe mass-loss rate and wind velocity of RGB and AGB stars are ependent on a large number of parameters. Using the modelled alues of mass-loss (3\u201320 \u00d710 \u22127 M yr \u22121 ) and wind velocity (2\u2013 km s \u22121 ) for the single brightest RGB and AGB stars in 47 Tuc McDonald et al. 2011 ) we obtain values of radii ranging between .2 and 0.5 pc. These values are comparable with the scale of the reak observed in the DM SF. To estimate the velocity of the turbulence we equate the rate of inetic energy supplied by the evolved stars to the rate of dissipation f kinetic energy in the turbulence (Moss & Shukurov 1996 ) as\nhere M\u0307 tot = 1 . 4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M yr \u22121 is the mass-loss from the stars ithin the half-mass radius of the cluster (McDonald & Zijlstra 015 ) and M g \u223c 2 M is the mass of the gas within the half-mass adius (Abbate et al. 2018 ). Using v \u2217 \u223c 20 km s \u22121 , the turbulent elocity becomes \u223c5.5 km s \u22121 . The eddy turnover time-scale, \u03c4 0 / v t , is \u223c1.1 \u00d7 10 5 yr.\nMAGNETI C FIELD C O N S I D E R AT I O N S\ne now turn our attention to the value of RM of the pulsars n 47 Tuc. The Galactic contribution to RM estimated from the ackground sources in the area surrounding 47 Tuc is + 22 \u00b1 8 ad m \u22122 (Hutschenreuter et al. 2022 ). To compare this value with the verage value of the pulsars, we first need to estimate how much f the RM seen in background sources originates from gas located n front of the GC. 47 Tuc is located \u223c4.5-kpc away (Baumgardt & asiliev 2021 ) in the Galactic halo at a Galactic latitude of \u223c\u221245 deg. he distance from the Galactic disc, \u223c3.2 kpc is larger than the scale eight of the warm ionized interstellar medium (ISM), 1.6\u20131.8 kpc Gaensler et al. 2008 ; Ocker, Cordes & Chatterjee 2020 ) and the cale height of the Galactic magnetic field 2.0 \u00b1 0.3 kpc (Sobey t al. 2019 ). Assuming exponentially decreasing discs for the warm onized ISM and the magnetic field, 91 per cent of the entire RM aused by the warm Galactic ISM along this line of sight comes from as located in front of the cluster. The compatibility between the RMs f the pulsars and the value from background sources suggests that he bulk of the RM is caused by the magnetized gas in the Galaxy.\ne turn our attention to the small but significant differences between he different pulsars.\n.1 Regular magnetic fields\nhe RM variations between the pulsars could be caused by diferences in the number density of electrons and the magnetic field rojected along the different lines of sight either in the Galactic disc, n the Galactic halo or in the GC.\nWe first try to see if a regular magnetic field located in the Galactic isc could cause the observed differences. Such a field would look s a linear gradient in RM across the cluster. We perform the fit of M using as input only the position of the pulsars along the plane of he sky and leaving as free parameters the direction of the gradient, ts intensity, and the value of RM at the position of the cluster centre. he fit makes use of the Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm mcee (F oreman-Macke y et al. 2013 ). The comparison between he measured RMs and the predictions of the best fit according to his model is shown in the top panel of Fig. 5 . The fit cannot account or most of the RMs of the pulsars. The reduced \u03c72 of the best fit is 2.3. Another possible source for the RM variations is the magnetic field n the halo. The GC is located at a distance of \u223c3.2 kpc below the alactic disc. At such distances, none of the models of the magnetic eld in the halo shows variations at the parsec and subparsec scale Ferri \u0300ere & Terral 2014 ). Such a field would contribute a constant uantity to all the pulsars and cannot explain the differences that we ee.\nNext, we look at the case that a magnetic field is located inside the C. In order for a regular magnetic field to be present in the GC, a\nMNRAS 518, 1642\u20131655 (2023)\nMNRAS 518, 1642\u20131655 (2023)\nFigure 3.

The only dynamo that could be active is the 2 dynamo. This mechanism only requires uniform velocity and its f fecti veness is determined by the dynamo number (Brandenburg & ubramanian 2005 ): \u03b1 = \u03b1R \u03b7T , (7) here \u03b1 is the mean helicity of the intracluster turbulence, R is the ize of the region of interest of the cluster, and \u03b7T is the turbulent agnetic dif fusi vity. The mean helicity can be approximated by he following expression (Ruzmaikin, Sokolov & Shukurov 1988 ): R 2 0 V /R 2 , where R 0 is the coherence scale of the turbulence and is the rotational velocity of the cluster. The turbulent magnetic if fusi vity has the form \u03b7T = (1 / 3) R 2 0 /\u03c4 (Brandenburg & Subramaian 2005 ), where \u03c4 is the eddy turno v er time-scale. The \u03b12 dynamo ecomes ef fecti ve if C \u03b1 > C \u03b1, crit , where C \u03b1, crit 30 (Brandenburg & ubramanian 2005 ). Putting everything together we find\n\u03b1 3 V \u03c4 R . (8)\nCalculating this factor at the half-mass radius, R \u223c 6 pc (Baumardt & Hilker 2018 ), we find C \u03b1 \u223c 0.3. If instead we restrict urselves in the region where the pulsars are present, R \u223c 1 pc, e find C \u03b1 \u223c 1.6. In both cases the values are significantly smaller han the critical value. Therefore, we do not expect this mechanism\nFigure 5. Plots showing the predicted RMs versus the measured RMs in the case of a regular magnetic with different geometries.

One possible magnetic field configuration that does not require a ean-field dynamo is a magnetic field with constant intensity and\nirection. This possibility could arise in case the magnetic field in he halo permeates inside the GC. In this case the differences in RM hould be caused entirely by differences in the number density of onized gas. We perform the fit of RM using as input the position f the pulsars along the line of sight measured from the centre f the cluster (Abbate et al. 2018 ) leaving as free parameters the trength of the magnetic field and the value of RM at the centre. The omparison between the measured RMs and the predictions of the est fit according to this model is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 5 . he model cannot account for the measured RMs with the best fit aving a reduced \u03c72 of 12. The best-fitting value for the strength f magnetic field derived using a constant value of gas density of .23 cm \u22123 (Abbate et al. 2018 ) is \u22120.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcG. This value is ompatible with zero at the 2 \u03c3 le vel; ho we ver, to be conserv ati ve, e take \u223c1 \u03bcG as an upper limit on the value of the constant internal agnetic field.\n.2 Turbulent magnetic fields\nn the absence of a regular magnetic field, the observed RM variations ould be explained by a turbulent medium. This could be detectable y looking at the RM SF. We use the same method and number of ins as the DM case. Also in this case, we try fitting the data with a roken power law and a single power law. The SF with the best fits s shown in Fig. 6 .\nAlso in this case, we repeat the calculation of the sensitivity limit etermined by the uncertainties on the measures using the same echnique as for DM. For the RMs, the SF of the white noise is f a similar order of magnitude as the observed RM SF and is hown in Fig. 6 as light blue points. For the bins at the smallest ngular separation, the sensitivity level is close to the observed value uggesting that the real value could be even lower.\nIn the case of the broken power-law fit, the 68 per cent confidence nterval of the power-la w inde x before the break is 1 . 1 + 0 . 5 \u22120 . 3 , for the ower-la w inde x after the break is 0 . 3 + 0 . 4 \u22120 . 7 , for the position of the reak is 38 + 66 \u221214 arcsec, and the value at the break is 2 . 4 + 0 . 9 \u22121 . 3 rad\n2 m \u22124 . n the case of the single power law, the 68 per cent confidence interval f the power-law index is 0 . 8 + 0 . 2 \u22120 . 2 and the value at 1 arcsec is 0 . 09 + 0 . 07 \u22120 . 04 ad 2 m \u22124 . We performed an F -test and found a p -value for the single ower law of 1 meaning that the extra parameters of the broken ower-law fit are not necessary. Differently from the DM case, there is o detection of a break. This could mean that the observed variations n RM originate from a different environment than the variations of M or that we are not sensitive enough to detect the break. In the rst case, we check if the variations of RM could be caused by the SM. In the second case, we estimate the how strong the magnetic eld inside 47 Tuc is expected to be and compare it to the observed Ms.\nMNRAS 518, 1642\u20131655 (2023)\nM\n5\nT R S b s t o v t o\nf s o 1 2\nt r \u223c\np t p L d s fl t p g i c\nu e H v t t O t\nw\nD\n7 o\nl r C o A L t\n5\nL\nm s m fl d h f a c t t v Z e b\nv\n\u03c3\nw t t s f\nS i a S s p v\n( R a 2\n\u03b7\nU 2 c 3 fl a\na l r\nB\nw v f\nt \u223c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/1642/6824449 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\n.3 Contribution of the ISM to the RM\nhe warm ISM is kno wn to sho w e vidence of turbulence (Armstrong, ickett & Spangler 1995 ; Chepurnov & Lazarian 2010 ). The RM F can be described by a turbulent spectrum with an increasing ehaviour at small angular scales and almost flat at large angular cales. The transition between the two regimes occurs at the outer urbulence scale. In order to estimate the contribution at the scales bserved in the case of 47 Tuc, we need an estimate of the saturation alue of the RMSF at large scales, D RM, sat , the size of the outer urbulence scale, r out , the slope below the break, \u03b1, and the location f the turbulence in the ISM, L T . The saturation value of the RM SF at large scales can be found rom the standard deviation of the RMs from background sources at imilar Galactic latitudes (Schnitzeler 2010 ). For a Galactic latitude f \u221245 \u25e6, the standard deviation of the RMs from the Milky Way is 1.9 rad m \u22122 . The saturation value of the SF is D RM , sat \u223c 2 \u03c3 2 RM \u223c 80 rad \u22122 m \u22124 . The outer scale of turbulence at mid-Galactic latitudes is expected o be linked to the size of the ejecta from supernova remnants at out \u223c 90 pc (Chepurnov & Lazarian 2010 ) with a possible range of 50\u2013250 pc (de Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2007 ; Hill et al. 2008 ). The power-la w inde x of the SF before the break depends on the roperties of the turbulence. The electron density in the ISM is hought to be well described by a Kolmogorov turbulence with a ower-la w inde x of \u03b1 = 5/3 (Armstrong et al. 1995 ; Chepurnov & azarian 2010 ). Ho we ver, the RM is caused by both the electron ensity and the magnetic field, which could follow a different pectrum. Different studies have shown that the electron density uctuations are dominant with respect to the magnetic field flucuations (Lazarian & Pogosyan 2016 ; Xu & Zhang 2016 ), so the ower-la w inde x is e xpected to be close to \u03b1 = 5/3. In the most eneral case of turbulence, the lowest value of the power-law index s \u03b1 = 1 (Lazarian & Pogosyan 2016 ). This value is larger but still ompatible with the best-fitting value of the single power-law fit.\nThe turbulence can in principle be located anywhere between s and the GC. Using magnetohydrodynamical simulations, Hill t al. ( 2008 ) have found that the observed properties of Galactic \u03b1 emission can be recreated by placing the turbulence within a ertical path-length of 400\u2013500 pc. At a Galactic latitude of \u221245 \u25e6, his corresponds to L T \u223c 560\u2013700 pc. As an upper limit, we choose he scale height of the warm ISM, 1.6\u20131.8 kpc (Gaensler et al. 2008 ; cker et al. 2020 ). At a Galactic latitude of \u221245 \u25e6, this corresponds o L T \u223c 2250\u20132550 pc. Putting all of this information together, the contribution of the\narm ISM to the SF at the angular scale of \u03b8 = 30 arcsec is\nRM , ISM ( \u03b8 ) = D RM , sat ( \u03b8L T\nr out\n)\u03b1 . (9)\nUsing D RM, sat = 280 rad \u22122 m \u22124 , r out = 90 pc, \u03b1 = 5/3, and L T = 00 pc, we find D RM, ISM ( \u03b8 ) = 0.005. This value is only \u223c0.3 per cent f the value observed. Alternatively, we can try to extend the observed single power aw to larger separations until we reach the saturation value. The adius at which the saturation value is reached is 4 . 5 + 13 . 2 \u22122 . 7 degrees. onverting it to physical distances using L T = 700 pc, we get an uter scale of 55 + 163 \u221233 pc, comparable with the predictions of de villez & Breitschwerdt ( 2007 ), Hill et al. ( 2008 ), and Chepurnov & azarian ( 2010 ). This suggests that, although the slope is shallower han predicted, the warm ISM could explain the RM variations.\nNRAS 518, 1642\u20131655 (2023)\n.4 Magnetic field inside the GC\net us examine the case of a magnetic field internal to the GC. If all of the observed variations in RM are caused by a turbulent agnetic field internal to the GC, we can estimate its expected\ntrength. We work under the assumption that the electron density and agnetic field can be described as a constant value plus Gaussian uctuations with zero mean. For the constant value of the electron ensity, we use a value of 0.23 cm \u22123 from Abbate et al. ( 2018 ); o we ver, for the magnetic field, we use 1 \u03bcG, the upper limit found or a regular magnetic field in the cluster estimated above. This ssumption only works well within a few parsecs of the cluster entre; ho we ver, outside, the density rapidly decreases. We estimate he thickness of the region where this assumption would hold, L , as he distance at which the density drops to a factor of e of its central alue. Using the profile density distribution presented in McDonald & ijlstra ( 2015 ), we find L = 6 pc; ho we ver, using the profile of Abbate t al. ( 2018 ), we find L = 3 pc. In the following analysis we consider oth values of L . If the RM originates from a region with a thickness of L , the ariance of RM should be (Xu & Zhang 2016 )\n2 RM \u223c (0 . 81) 2 ( n 2 e \u03c3 2 B + B 2 z \u03c3 2 n ) L 2 , (10)\nhere \u03c3 2 B and \u03c3 2 n are the variances of the turbulent magnetic field and urbulent electron density , respectively . With the same assumptions, he variance of electron density can be written as \u03c3 2 n = \u03c3 2 DM /L 2 . The tandard deviation of the turbulent magnetic field becomes 0.8 \u03bcG or L = 6 pc and 1.6 \u03bcG for L = 3 pc.\nIf the evidence of a turbulent medium provided by the DM F is real, we can estimate the theoretical predictions of the\nnternal magnetic field. The presence of turbulence in the gas could cti v ate the fluctuation dynamo (Kazantsev 1968 ; Brandenburg & ubramanian 2005 ) and amplify the seed magnetic fields of the tellar winds. This dynamo becomes active in any turbulent medium rovided the magnetic Reynolds number is higher than the critical alue Re (crit) M \u223c 100 (Federrath et al. 2014 ).\nWe estimate the magnetic Reynolds number Re M = v t R 0 / \u03b7 Moss & Shukurov 1996 ), where v t is the velocity of the turbulence, 0 is the energy injection scale, and \u03b7 is the Spitzer resistivity that, for thermal plasma at temperature T , is (Brandenburg & Subramanian 005 )\n10 4 ( T\n10 6 K\n)\u22123 / 2 cm 2 s \u22121 . (11)\nsing T = 2 \u00d7 10 4 K (McDonald & Zijlstra 2015 ; Abbate et al. 018 ), we obtain \u03b7 3 . 5 \u00d7 10 6 cm 2 s \u22121 . Using this value in the alculation of the magnetic Reynolds numbers we get Re M \u223c .5 \u00d7 10 17 . This is significantly greater than the limit abo v e which the uctuation dynamo begins to become ef fecti ve. Fluctuation dynamos re therefore ef fecti ve at amplifying magnetic fields in 47 Tuc.\nA fluctuation dynamo is capable of amplifying magnetic fields by factor of e every eddy turnover time-scale, until the equipartition evel between the turbulent energy and the magnetic energy has been eached. This corresponds to a magnetic field of\neq = \u221a 4 \u03c0\u03c1v 2 t , (12)\nhere \u03c1 is the mass density of the gas. We get B eq \u223c 1.4 \u03bcG. This alue is comparable to the estimate of the turbulent magnetic field rom the observed RMs and DMs.\nAfter reaching this value, dissipation forces come into play and he amplification stops. The gas stays inside of the cluster only for\n4 Myr (McDonald & Zijlstra 2015 ). This means that the gas goes\nt s T e a r p 2 ( w m s t\n\u03bc t 2 G e A M b t\n6\nT d T t m\n( t 2 t g G g o\nd c h t e t b ( L f s t w p\nT p\n1\nt\nt l m i t G l s m\nA\nT A R n o ( P w S t T N a S b A s t l a A ( D M D d O u i i F A F\nD\nT r\nR\nA\nA\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/1642/6824449 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nhrough \u223c37 eddy turno v er time-scales before being ejected and the eed magnetic field can be amplified up to 16 orders of magnitude. he seed magnetic field of the cluster medium can be found by stimating the magnetic field on the surface of the evolved stars nd then applying magnetic flux conservation up to the largest scales eached by the wind. The typical radius of low-mass stars in the RGB hase is \u223c10 R (Cassisi & Salaris 1997 ; Mullan & MacDonald 019 ). The magnetic field on the surface of these stars is 1\u201310 G Auri \u0300ere et al. 2015 ; Mullan & MacDonald 2019 ). Flux conservation ould imply that, after reaching a distance of R 0 \u223c 0.6 pc, the agnetic field would have fallen to 10 \u22127 \u201310 \u22126 \u03bcG. In order for this eed field to be amplified up to the equipartition value of \u223c1 \u03bcG by he fluctuation dynamo, a time of 1.5\u20131.7 Myr is necessary.\nOther ways to explain the presence of a magnetic field of a few G located in the GC are from the halo magnetic field penetrating in he GC and from local amplification at shock surfaces (Bohdan et al. 021 ). Ho we ver, the thermal pressure from the expanding gas in the C (McDonald & Zijlstra 2015 ) prevents the gas from the halo to nter and deposit magnetic fields close to the location of the pulsars. dditionally, the winds from the stars mo v e at speeds (2\u20134 km s \u22121 ; cDonald et al. 2011 ) lower than the sound speed ( \u223c16 km s \u22121 ; Abate et al. 2018 ) and the Alfv \u0301en speed ( v a = v t \u223c 5.5 km s \u22121 ), meaning hat there are no shocks where the magnetic fields can be amplified.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\nhe polarization profiles of the pulsars in 47 Tuc obtained with eep MeerKAT observations are shown with unprecedented details. he precise measurements of the DM and RM have allowed us o investigate the presence of turbulence in electron density and agnetic fields along the line of sight. The DM SF sho ws e vidence of a break at a scale of \u223c30 arcsec \u223c0.6 pc at the distance of 47 Tuc). According to the Kolmogorov heory of turbulence (Minter & Spangler 1996 ; Lazarian & Pogosyan 016 ), this break could be interpreted as the energy injection scale in a urb ulent medium. The turb ulence could arise from the stirring of the as by the random motion of the evolved wind-shedding stars in the C (Moss & Shukurov 1996 ). The scale at which these stars deposit as in the cluster (0.2\u20130.5 pc) is comparable with the observed scale f the break. The RM SF does not sho w e vidence of a break but can be escribed by a single power law. This could arise either from the RM ontributions of the Galactic ISM or from the gas in the GC. In the ypothesis of the ISM being main contributor, the power-law index of he SF ( \u223c0.8) is shallower than the expected value of 5/3. However, xtending the SF out to the values observed in background sources, he observations are compatible with a value of the outer scale of turulence in the warm ISM of \u223c50 pc, similar to previous predictions de Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2007 ; Hill et al. 2008 ; Chepurnov & azarian 2010 ). Alternati vely, the v ariations of the RM could arise rom a turbulent magnetic field inside of the GC. The turbulence is trong enough to acti v ate the fluctuation dynamo that could amplify he magnetic fields of the gas up to \u223c1 \u03bcG. This value is compatible ith the observed variations in RM. In this case, the break should be resent; ho we ver, we are not sensiti ve enough to detect it. The recent pulsar disco v eries in the cluster by the MeerIME/TRAPUM group at MeerKAT (Ridolfi et al. 2021 ) 10 could rovide a larger number of baselines that can help confirm or rule out\n0 The up-to-date list of disco v eries can be found at the website: http://www. rapum.org/discoveries/\nA A B\nhe presence of a break in the DM and RM SF. This would allow us to ocalize the turbulence either in the ISM or in the GC itself. Turbulent\nediums and magnetic fields of similar values should also be present n other GCs but may not be detectable due to the contribution of he ISM that is stronger the closer we mo v e to the Galactic plane. Cs with high Galactic latitudes and with a large number of pulsars ike NGC 1851 (Ridolfi et al. 2022 ) and \u03c9 Centauri (Chen et al., ubmitted) would be the best targets to look for internal gas and agnetic fields.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhe MeerKAT telescope is operated by the South African Radio stronomy Observatory (SARAO), which is a facility of the National esearch Foundation, an agency of the Department of Science and Inov ation.

( 2 0 2 0 )\nhe values of RM reported in this work and the implications for the agnetic field are significantly different from the ones reported in bbate et al. ( 2020 ). That paper used observations from Parkes in band (1208\u20131520 MHz) using the CASPSR backend to measure\nhe RMs of the pulsars. The authors were able to find RM values for 3 of the pulsars with a total spread o v er \u223c40 rad m \u22122 . These data uggested the presence of a gradient in RM across the cluster. The pread in RM for the pulsars in 47 Tuc measured in this work is only 5 rad m \u22122 . We searched for the presence of a gradient as discussed n Section 5.1 . The resulting best-fitting model in the top panel of ig. 5 shows no evidence of such gradient. RM has a dependence of f \u22122 on the frequency. This means that nly considering the different observing bands, 550\u20131050 MHz for he UHF band at MeerKAT and 1208\u20131520 MHz for the L band at arkes , the uncertainties for MeerKAT would be \u223c10 times smaller. urthermore, the pulsars are brighter at lower frequencies due to their pectral index. This, together with the larger collecting area, implies hat the MeerKAT pulsar detections have a significantly higher S/N ompared to the Parkes detections, as can be seen comparing the olarization profiles presented in both works. This effect additionally educes the uncertainty for the RMs measured in the MeerKAT bservations. Only five pulsars have RMs incompatible between the two works t the 2 \u03c3 level, namely 47Tuc C, I, J, N, and Q. We checked if this iscrepancy is real or caused by the technique by which the RMs re measured. We reco v ered the original calibrated and folded data rom Parkes used in Abbate et al. ( 2020 ) and redetermined the RM f all pulsars with the technique described abo v e. The comparison mong the old results from Parkes , the results from Parkes with he new analysis, and the results from the MeerKAT observations is hown in Table A1 . With the only exception of 47Tuc J, we find alues compatible at 2 \u03c3 with the ones from MeerKAT observations eported in this work. We find consistently larger uncertainties than hat reported in Abbate et al. ( 2020 ), meaning that their errors ight have been underestimated. Furthermore, we note that in their nalysis, they did not correct the profiles for the value of RM that aximizes the linear polarization percentage. This might lead to an mprecise determination of the position angle and to a wrong value f RM in the case of low S/N in linear polarization. The new values f RM from the old Parkes observations do not show any indication f a gradient in the direction suggested by Abbate et al. ( 2020 ). The only case where we were not able to reco v er compatible esults is 47Tuc J. The value measured from the Parkes data is 10 \u00b1 6 rad m \u22122 compared to + 24.0 \u00b1 0.3 rad m \u22122 measured rom the MeerKAT observations presented in this work. In analysing he different observations made with Parkes , we find that, due to cintillation, most of the S/N comes from two observations: one 2- long on 2014 August 20 and one 6-h long on 2015 March 15.\nTable A1.

We note hat the value derived from the second observation is compatible at \u03c3 with the value from the MeerKAT observations. This pulsar is n a binary system with orbital period of 2.9 h and shows regular clipses. The observation on 2014 August 20 co v ered the orbital hases around the eclipse while the observation on 2015 March 15 o v ered two entire orbits. The different RMs could be explained y the effects of the material that cause the eclipse. We tested his hypothesis by looking at the observation of 47Tuc J taken at eerKAT on 2022 June 9. We divided the observation in 20-min egments and determined the RM for the different segments. The egments far from the eclipsing region showed a value consistent ith the orbit-averaged value. On the other hand, the segments lose to the eclipse showed lower values of linear polarization. This ade it impossible to determine an accurate value of RM for these egments. This effect can cause an inaccurate determination of RM n the Parkes observation of 2014 August 20 that occurred around the clipse. We also point to a different reference (Zhang et al. 2019 ) that easured the value of RM for pulsars 47Tuc C, D, and J using the ltra-Wideband Lo w recei v er (704\u20134032 MHz) at Parkes . F or the ulsar 47Tuc J, they obtain a value of 20 \u00b1 4 rad m \u22122 , compatible ith the MeerKAT measurement but not with that at the L band with arkes . We note that a few of the polarization profiles corrected for RM hown in this work present components with almost 100 per cent inear polarization. These are 47Tuc G, L, N, Q, U, W, and X. Since he ionized gas that causes the RM has the effect of depolarizing the ulsed signal, the true RM corresponds to the maximum polarized ignal. We conclude that these values have to be close to the correct alue. his paper has been typeset from a T X/L A T X file prepared by the author.\nMNRAS 518, 1642\u20131655 (2023)\nchnology Patna user on 18 January 2024"
