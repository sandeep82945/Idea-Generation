Comparative Effectiveness of XHP Against Other Treatments: Investigate how XHP compares to other current treatments for ALD, including both traditional Western medications and other herbal formulations. This research could involve clinical trials comparing the efficacy, safety, side effects, and cost-effectiveness of XHP with those of other established ALD treatments.

Mechanistic Studies on Individual Components of XHP: Given that XHP is a multi-component herbal formulation, individual studies on each of its components could provide deeper insights into their specific roles and mechanisms in hepatoprotection. This research could help identify which components are most crucial for the formulation’s efficacy and might lead to the development of more refined and potentially more powerful treatments.

Long-term Effects and Safety Profile of XHP: While the current study provides promising results on the hepatoprotective effects of XHP, long-term studies are necessary to fully understand the safety profile of XHP, including any potential toxicities or side effects associated with prolonged use. This is particularly important for treatments like TCM formulations, which are often used continuously over long periods.

Molecular Docking and Proteomics for New Target Discovery: The current study employed molecular docking and proteomics to identify and confirm targets of XHP. Future research could extend these methodologies to discover new targets not only for XHP but also for other compounds or formulations in ALD treatment. This could lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic pathways and targets.

Development of Personalized Medicine Approaches for ALD Treatment: Utilize the network pharmacology and bioinformatics data generated in this study to explore personalized medicine approaches for ALD treatment. This could involve genotyping patients to identify those most likely to benefit from XHP treatment based on their genetic makeup or molecular characteristics of their disease. This research direction aligns with the broader trend towards personalized or precision medicine, offering treatments tailored to individual patients’ profiles for enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects.
