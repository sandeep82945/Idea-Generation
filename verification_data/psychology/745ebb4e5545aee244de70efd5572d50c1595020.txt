"It is necessary to make an extensive microbial analysis in order to fully assess the antibacterial activity of enzyme-modified lysozyme. The results of this analysis will be provided in a separate study. Preliminary tests were conducted in this study to assess the effect of the preparations obtained after the modification of lysosome with pepsin and trypsin on selected types of bacteria. The tests showed that the effect of the modified lysozyme on bacteria depended on the modification method. The samples obtained during the second modification variant (Variant 2) were characterised by better antibacterial activity. Table 3 shows the results of an evaluation of the antibacterial effect of selected pepsin-modified lysozyme preparations containing the highest proportion of the peptide fraction. The incubation of the modified lysozyme with the bacterial strains used in the tests prolonged the lag phase of the bacteria. The lysosome preparations had a better antibacterial effect against the Gram-positive Listeria innocua bacteria. Neither the trypsinmodified lysozyme nor the modified lysozyme preparations obtained in the first variant of the experiment (variant 1) inhibited bacterial growth effectively. However, the results of the preliminary test of the enzymatically modified lysozyme indicated that the spectrum of the antibacterial activity of the enzyme could be extended. An in-depth assessment will be possible only after conducting a full study on the antibacterial activity of the enzyme, which is currently being conducted independently."
