1. **Investigate the use of machine learning algorithms for EIS analysis.** This could help to improve the accuracy and reliability of S100B detection, and could also be used to develop new diagnostic tools for TBI.


2. **Explore the use of non-faradaic electrochemical measurements for S100B detection.** This would eliminate the need for a redox solution, which could make the technology more scalable and easier to use in a clinical setting.


3. **Develop a fully programmable DC bias voltage potentiostat.** This would allow the TBISTAT to be used for a wider range of applications, including those that require the use of a DC bias voltage.


4. **Increase the frequency range of the TBISTAT.** This would allow the device to be used to measure impedances at higher frequencies, which could be useful for detecting other biomarkers or for studying the electrical properties of materials.


5. **Develop a smartphone app that can be used to control the TBISTAT and display the results of EIS measurements.** This would make the device more user-friendly and easier to use in a clinical setting.
