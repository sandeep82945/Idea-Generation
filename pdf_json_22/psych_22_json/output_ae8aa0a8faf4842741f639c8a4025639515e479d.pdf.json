    "abstractText": "Suicide and suicide-related behaviors are prevalent yet notoriously difficult to predict. Specifically, short-term predictors and correlates of suicide risk remain largely unknown. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) may be used to assess how suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) unfold in real-world contexts. We conducted a systematic literature review of EMA studies in suicide research to assess (1) how EMA has been utilized in the study of STBs (i.e., methodology, findings), and (2) the feasibility, validity and safety of EMA in the study of STBs. We identified 45 articles, detailing 23 studies. Studies mainly focused on examining how known longitudinal predictors of suicidal ideation perform within shorter (hourly, daily) time frames. Recent studies have explored the prospects of digital phenotyping of individuals with suicidal ideation. The results indicate that suicidal ideation fluctuates substantially over time (hours, days), and that individuals with higher mean ideation also have more fluctuations. Higher suicidal ideation instability may represent a phenotypic indicator for increased suicide risk. Few studies succeeded in establishing prospective predictors of suicidal ideation beyond prior ideation itself. Some studies show negative affect, hopelessness and burdensomeness to predict increased ideation within-day, and sleep characteristics to impact next-day ideation. The feasibility of EMA is encouraging: agreement to participate in EMA research was moderate to high (median = 77%), and compliance rates similar to those in other clinical samples (median response rate = 70%). More individuals reported suicidal ideation through EMA than traditional (retrospective) self-report measures. Regarding safety, no evidence was found of systematic reactivity of mood or suicidal ideation to repeated assessments of STBs. In conclusion, suicidal ideation can fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, and EMA is a suitable method for capturing these fluctuations. Some specific predictors of subsequent ideation have been identified, but these findings warrant further replication. While repeated EMA assessments do not appear to result in systematic reactivity in STBs, participant burden and safety remains a consideration when studying high-risk populations. Considerations for designing and reporting on EMA studies in suicide research are discussed.",

We conducted a systematic literature\nreview of EMA studies in suicide research to assess (1) how EMA has been utilized in the\nstudy of STBs (i.e., methodology, findings), and (2) the feasibility, validity and safety of\nEMA in the study of STBs. We identified 45 articles, detailing 23 studies. Studies mainly\nfocused on examining how known longitudinal predictors of suicidal ideation perform\nwithin shorter (hourly, daily) time frames. Recent studies have explored the prospects\nof digital phenotyping of individuals with suicidal ideation. The results indicate that\nsuicidal ideation fluctuates substantially over time (hours, days), and that individuals with\nhigher mean ideation also have more fluctuations. Higher suicidal ideation instability may\nrepresent a phenotypic indicator for increased suicide risk. Few studies succeeded in\nestablishing prospective predictors of suicidal ideation beyond prior ideation itself. Some\nstudies show negative affect, hopelessness and burdensomeness to predict increased\nideation within-day, and sleep characteristics to impact next-day ideation. The feasibility\nof EMA is encouraging: agreement to participate in EMA research was moderate to\nhigh (median = 77%), and compliance rates similar to those in other clinical samples\n(median response rate = 70%). More individuals reported suicidal ideation through EMA\nthan traditional (retrospective) self-report measures. Regarding safety, no evidence was\nfound of systematic reactivity of mood or suicidal ideation to repeated assessments\nof STBs. In conclusion, suicidal ideation can fluctuate substantially over short periods\nof time, and EMA is a suitable method for capturing these fluctuations. Some specific\npredictors of subsequent ideation have been identified, but these findings warrant further\nreplication. While repeated EMA assessments do not appear to result in systematic\nreactivity in STBs, participant burden and safety remains a consideration when studying\nhigh-risk populations. Considerations for designing and reporting on EMA studies in\nsuicide research are discussed.\nKeywords: suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, experience sampling method, ambulatory assessment, electronic diary\nKivel\u00e4 et al.

            "text": "Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) refers to data collection methods were momentary information is collected in real life (1). EMA is also known as experience sampling method (ESM) (2) or ambulatory assessment (AA) (3). These three terms emphasize the defining features of this methodology: catching individuals in their natural environments while they go about their daily lives, and probing them about their experiences as they unfold in the moment. Indeed, the most prominent strengths of EMA are its ecological validity and the ability to perform repeated assessments (1, 4). Technological advancements have further increased the feasibility of EMA measures: as opposed to undergoing assessments that are either based on retrospective self-report or performed in non-representative laboratory settings, participants may now provide time- and context-specific data through their smartphones (1, 3, 5).\nWhile paper-and-pen diaries and later handheld computers or personal digital assistants (PDAs) were first used to collect EMA data, many studies now use mobile phone applications specifically designed for EMA purposes (6). These applications function as electronic diaries that may be used to prompt participants to record their mood, cognitions, behavior, context (incl. social interactions) and other experiences, typically either through text entries, event logs or rating scales (6). Such electronic EMA assessments typically use either signal-contingent or event-contingent sampling, prompting participants to fill out assessments either when alerted by the device, or when certain events naturally occur in their daily lives. These methods may also be combined (1, 6, 7). Signal-contingent sampling schedules can further be divided into fixed and (pseudo)randomized schedules. EMA assessments sent out on fixed schedules prompt participants at the same time(s) each day, while randomized schedules send out prompts at random times throughout the day; pseudorandomized schedules divide each 24-h period into blocks, and random prompts are sent out per block. Pseudorandomization offers advantages over full randomization, as it ensures that assessments are sufficiently paced out within the day, but also that participants do not systematically miss prompts due pre-determined commitments like work or school schedules, or learn to anticipate prompts (8).\nEMA has been increasingly adopted in the study of psychopathology. This may be a promising approach since insights into the psychological states and behavior patterns in the daily life of the patient can be targeted in therapy (9). Recent reviews have outlined the applicability of EMA in a number of clinical populations, including patients with depression (10, 11) and anxiety disorders (12), eating disorders (13), borderline personality disorder (14), and psychotic disorders (15). These reviews indicate that EMA is an acceptable and feasible data collection method in psychiatric samples as well, and that it may be used to assess a range of experiences from affect (16) to self-harm (17) and substance use (18). Indeed, EMA can hold many advantages over traditional self-report measures for these purposes. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression (19, 20) and schizophrenia (21), are often characterized by memory biases. Retrospective accounts of certain behaviors, such as substance\nuse, are also characteristically unreliable (8). Individuals may also be more willing to disclose sensitive information, such as accounts of drug use or self-harm, when they can do so remotely without face-to-face contact with the researcher (22). Further, EMA is an especially suitable method for assessing symptoms that are dynamic in nature (such as affective instability) (6, 23), which may be time or context dependent, and for which global retrospective measures provide only approximations (1). However, the benefits of EMA should be considered together with its possible limitations, which may include increased burden and time commitment from participants, and potential reactivity to repeated assessments of negative experiences (24).\nMeanwhile, EMA remains a relatively underused data collection method in suicide research, although its features make it suitable for the assessment of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) (4, 25, 26). Suicide and suicide-related phenomena [ideation i.e., thoughts or fantasies about one\u2019s death (27), attempts] represent a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide (28, 29). Several risk-factors for suicide are known, including psychiatric and demographic variables such as depression, gender and stress (28\u201330). However, these factors have quite limited clinical use: they are poor predictors of shortterm behavior, or are non-modifiable (e.g., gender, past STBs). Their base rate is also much higher than that of suicide, and basing clinical decisions on these risk factors would result in an abundance of false positives (31\u201333) and many interventions are generic and are not very efficacious (34). Meanwhile, acute warning signs of suicide risk remain less well studied and understood (35). Two recent meta-analyses concluded that there has been no improvement in the prediction of suicide risk in the past fifty years (31, 33). Many have called for a shift of focus towards prospectively predicting STBs in the short term (within days or even hours) (4, 34, 36). Both suicidal ideation and its risk factors can fluctuate substantially over short periods of time (days and hours) (37). Indeed, it has been suggested that (between-day) variability in suicidal ideationmay be a better predictor of suicide than its intensity or duration (37, 38).\nIn summary, the study of STBs needs a new focus and methodology, for which EMA holds promise. Its limited use so far in suicide research may reflect concerns about the potentially adverse effects of repeated probing of suicidal thoughts and urges in at-risk groups. It has been demonstrated that asking individuals about their suicidal thoughts and behaviors does not induce suicidal ideation in asymptomatic individuals, nor does it increase risk in those affected. In fact, it may even serve to lessen ideation and general distress in high-risk individuals (39, 40). Limited evidence exists, however, on the question of whether this also holds for as frequently repeated assessments as with EMA schedules. The validity of EMA measures of STBs is also uncertain. Self-reports of suicidal behavior can be very unstable over time due to erroneous recall (41). Further, only a limited number of items can be used to cover a certain construct in EMA protocols (6)\u2013sometimes only a single item is used [see e.g., (42)].\nThe aim of this systematic review was to determine: (i) how EMA has been used to operationalize and measure STBs (incl. methodology, aim, findings), and (ii) the feasibility, validity and safety of EMA in research on STBs. We exclude studies on\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2022 | Volume 4 | Article 876595\nKivel\u00e4 et al.

All studies used some form of signal-contingent sampling: (pseudo)random sampling schedules were most frequently used [57%, n = 13 (42, 47, 51, 58, 61, 65, 69, 71, 79, 83, 85, 86, 88)], followed by fixed sampling [26%, n = 6 (45, 66, 67, 72, 80, 82)], and protocols that combined both fixed and (pseudo)random sampling [13%, n = 3 (47, 56, 60)]. Fixed schedules were almost exclusively used in studies with once-daily prompts (as well as three older studies with PDAs (45, 81, 82)), whereas pseudorandom schedules were typically used for repeated withinday assessments. Approximately one fourth (26%; n = 6) of studies supplemented signal-contingent sampling with eventcontingent sampling [i.e., participants were encouraged to selfinitiate additional entries when experiencing STBs (45, 47, 61, 69, 85)], but none of the studies used event-contingent sampling alone. Studies frequently (57%, n = 13; (47, 51, 58, 60, 61, 69, 71, 79\u201381, 85, 86)) reported that participants could provide input about their daily schedules (incl. sleep and wake times), allowing EMA prompt windows to be adjusted for each participant, and a minimum time window (30\u201360min) between prompts was established with (pseudo)random schedules to achieve better temporal coverage.\nMeasured Variables and Operationalization of STBs While all studies included EMA items on suicidal ideation, four studies (18%) also assessed the occurrence of suicide attempts via EMA (45, 80, 82, 88) (see Tables 1, 2 for full list of measured variables and SI item descriptions). The number of EMA items on STBs ranged from 1 to 9 (median = 2, n = 22). The items were typically rated on a 5-point Likert-scale; seven (32%) studies used binary items, or a combination of an initial binary item on the presence of STBs, followed by ratings on frequency, intensity and/or duration (18%, n= 4). Items were often based on established self-report questionnaires or structured interviews, such as the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI) (89) or the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) (90), and rephrased to reflect the time period of the EMA or otherwise adapted for the purposes of the study.\nSeveral studies used gate questions to limit the number of questions presented pertaining to STBs. Such gate questions either first inquired about the presence of (any) negative thoughts prior to direct questioning of suicidal ideation [see e.g., (81)], or limited follow-up questions on the intensity, frequency and/or duration of ideation only to those instances where suicidal ideation was first endorsed [see e.g., (45, 55, 61, 85)]. Two studies used a turn-over system where a subset of questions was randomly presented at a certain time point to limit repetition (83, 87). Studies were heterogenous in their operationalization of STBs, and no clear delineation emerged over time on preferred methodologies or use of specific EMA items.\nThe most frequently measured predictor variables included contextual factors (incl. location, activity, social company), affect, and constructs from the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide [IPTS: hopelessness, burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness (91)]. Protective factors, such as coping and social support, were less frequently assessed."

Within-day, approximately one third of ratings differed from the previous one by at least one (within-person) standard deviation, illustrating both sharp increases and decreases in ideation in a time frame of hours [4\u20138 h (47)]. Those with higher mean ideation (per person, across EMA period) experienced more variability (47, 65, 66). Risk factors (negative affect, hopelessness, loneliness, burdensomeness, connectedness, thwarted belongingness) occurred with similar variability, and were concurrently associated with suicidal ideation (47, 55, 56, 68, 78). General affective instability (i.e., tendency to experience frequent, sudden changes in mood) was associated with suicidal ideation variability among female BPD patients (58), and inpatient individuals diagnosed with MDD or bipolar disorder (66). Generally, baseline clinical characteristics, such as severity of depressive symptoms [retrospective self-report of symptoms over the past 2 weeks (48)] were not differentially associated with suicidal ideation variability. The test-retest reliability of EMAassessed within-person suicidal ideation variability (as estimated by the Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences, RMSSD) was high across 24months (65). Suicidal ideation variability (here operationalized as the individual\u2019s likelihood of experiencing extreme changes in suicidal ideation from one assessment point to the next) was also predictive of the occurrence of a suicide attempt at 1-month follow-up post-discharge, based on a pilot study of 83 adults hospitalized for a suicidal crisis (79)."

Across studies, prior suicidal ideation therefore remained the strongest (or only) predictor of subsequent ideation (i.e., suicidal ideation at T significantly predicting ideation at T+1). Regarding other predictors, the most consistent evidence was found for momentary negative affect, hopelessness and burdensomeness. These variables predicted increased momentary suicidal ideation within-day (47, 56, 57, 60). One study indicated that active coping reduced the intensity of ideation at the subsequent assessment 2 h later (77). Between days, short sleep duration (both objective and subjective), poor subjective sleep quality and increased sleep\nlatency (i.e., time to fall asleep) predicted (mean) next-day suicidal ideation (51, 74). Negative interpersonal events were also associated with increased next-day suicidal ideation (73). The probability of finding influential predictors was further lower with increasing intervals. Studies examining day-to-day rather than within-day changes in suicidal ideation were less likely to report positive findings (55, 80). This may be due to reduced temporal granularity of data due to aggregate daily ratings."

            "text": "Among the 23 reviewed studies, substantial variability existed in the operationalization of STBs. This ranged from single-item binary measures of general self-harm ideation (42) to multiitem batteries assessing the intensity, frequency and duration of specific suicidal thoughts [see e.g., (55, 65)]. General guidelines for EMA research emphasize that items should be formulated in a way that allows for the assessment of the natural fluctuations in momentary experience, while limiting potential floor and ceiling effects (101). Binary items generally lack these characteristics. Single-item measures may also not be sufficient in capturing the wide spectrum of ideation, such as distinguishing passive from active ideation and intent. Further, suicidal ideation alone is not the only permissive characteristic preceding suicidal acts; a transition from ideation to attempt requires acquired capability, that is, additional cognitive and behavioral processes, such as decreased fear of death and increased pain tolerance (30). These latter characteristics can also fluctuate substantially from day to day (59).\nThe strength of EMA for suicide research remains in its ability to capture more variable aspects of suicide risk that may be difficult to grasp by traditional retrospective questionnaires. From our review we conclude that suicidal ideation exhibits substantial variability over time, often increasing or decreasing sharply within only a few hours in an individual [see e.g., (47)]. Witte and colleagues (37, 38) have proposed that such variability in suicidal ideation may provide a more reliable index of suicide risk than the severity or duration of ideation alone. This notion is tentatively supported by findings of higher suicidal ideation variability among patients with more severe suicidal ideation (47, 65, 66), as well as those with a prior suicide attempt history (66), and by higher EMA suicidal ideation variability predicting attempts at 1-month follow-up (79). In line with these findings, a previous review of EMA studies on NSSI also identified affective variability as a risk factor for engaging in self-harm behavior (17). While these preliminary findings warrant further replication, they indicate that suicidal ideation variability may represent a promising marker for suicide risk.\nIn addition to suicidal ideation itself, a number of its risk factors (incl. negative affect, hopelessness, loneliness, burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness) were also found to exhibit similar variability patterns and associate with momentary ideation. However, fewer studies so far have succeeded in establishing prospective predictors of suicidal ideation. A similar pattern is observable in the EMA literature on NSSI, where most studies have elucidated on the immediate context,\nrather than precipitants, of self-harm behavior (17). Kaurin et al. (64) outlined the ongoing discourse in EMA literature over the relative value of time-lagged vs. concurrent (or contemporaneous) modeling approaches. While longitudinal modeling is often regarded as superior in traditional research designs, contemporaneous associations derived from EMA data reflect associations beyond simple co-occurrences; rather, they reflect systematic covariances between variables, and can signal the presence of temporal associations occurring very close in time. Hence, these findings indicate that a number of known longitudinal predictors of suicidal ideation are also involved in its imminent emergence over shorter time frames. Considering emerging evidence that suicidal ideation variability may represent an important marker for acute risk, increased understanding of the factors underlying these fluctuations is of great importance."

Meanwhile, compliance was good and not substantially lower than in other clinical (103) or non-clinical populations [see e.g., (104)]. This is in line with reports that EMA compliance is not significantly influenced by demographic or clinical characteristics (105).\nRegardless, maintaining compliance with EMA remains a challenge, especially when assessment periods grow long, as compliance decreases over time with each subsequent week of EMA [see e.g., (80, 85)]. Meanwhile, compliance rates did not appear lower in studies using multiple measures per day (vs. once-daily ratings). It has also previously been reported thatmore frequent assessments may not reduce compliance (106), or may even increase compliance (107), as long as questionnaires are kept brief (108). Shorter time intervals between prompts can also increase compliance (109). However, overly lengthy measures can induce fatigue and reduce compliance, as well as impact data quality due to increased careless responding or skipping questions (108, 110). Based on our review, researchers may be advised to prioritize more frequent, but brief assessments over short time periods to establish higher compliance; future research should aim to more systematically examine how increasing the number of daily prompts affects compliance rates, in order to establish optimal sampling schedules that balance temporal coverage with participant burden. Researchers may also consider implementing incentives for compliance. Many of the reviewed studies used monetary rewards for increasing or sustaining compliance [see e.g., (85, 88)]. However, monetary incentives are reported as relatively unimpactful in increasing compliance, based on a review of 481 EMA studies (111). Alternative incentives, such as personalized feedback based on EMA data, may be regarded as more valuable (112).\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org 16 May 2022 | Volume 4 | Article 876595\nKivel\u00e4 et al. EMA in Suicide Research\nIn line with the observation that all of the reviewed studies used signal-contingent sampling (either alone or in conjunction with event-contingent sampling), we may also recommend this approach for future research, as signal-contingent sampling more optimally allows for the examination of the variability in experience of STBs. Finally, further research is needed to generalize these recommendations to other age groups (such as the elderly) and non-Western societies. As the reviewed studies exclusively focused on adolescents and adults (who may already be more accustomed to using technology to track their lives), it remains to be established whether such electronic symptom selfmonitoring would be perceived as equally acceptable, and helpful, by older populations."

We further found that EMA reports of active suicidal ideation were more highly correlated with retrospective measures than those of passive ideation (86). It is tempting to speculate that EMA has increased sensitivity in detecting momentary, fleeting, and/or passive instances of ideation. However, the possibility that part of this increased reporting is due to reactivity to the EMA questions (i.e., symptom increases due to enhanced focus on them) cannot be disregarded (24, 113), although the current evidence does not support such assessment reactivity (see below)."

Some behaviors, like alcohol use among substance dependent patients, may be more subject to reactive effects than cognitive or affective symptoms (103). However, these conclusions are tentative at best due to the low number of studies directly assessing reactivity, and the general lack of control groups across studies. Further, available studies were seriously limited in their assessment and reporting of adverse events (suicide attempts, mortality) occurring during the study period.

Further, participants may not always provide accurate reports of their experiences for fear of intervention, as many people planning suicide explicitly deny such intentions\n(115). EMA safety protocols should consequently also involve contact with participants lost to attrition, and additional contact should be made not only when participants indicate severe symptomatology, but also when EMA prompts are systematically missed [as also previously done by e.g., (45)]."

Further, there was insufficient reporting of other study characteristics: 12 (55%) studies did not report acceptability, three (14%) did not report any index of compliance (with further inconsistencies in how compliance was defined), 14 (63%) did not report on attrition, 12 (55%) did not report adverse events, and 11 (50%) did not report whether any safety measures were implemented. Additional characteristics that may impact data quality and inference, such as amount and patterns of missing data, and information on average time intervals between prompts, as well as delay from alert to response, were rarely reported. A recent review of EMA of NSSI noted similar study heterogeneity and lack of reporting on compliance (17). Reviewers evaluating EMA studies for publication should require these to be reported. Finally, how to adequately measure EMA item reliability and validity remains to be established (although first initiatives have started, such as the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) Item Repository (https://osf.io/kg376/). Correlations with retrospective measures, or moment-to-moment reliability statistics may not provide adequate indications of good psychometric fit, as EMA ratings are expected to vary over time rather than stay constant."

Beyond EMA interventions (116, 117), EMA assessments in themselves may serve a therapeutic purpose: feedback from participants indicates that EMAmade themmore reflective, introspective, and mindful of their experiences [see e.g., (88)]. Further, for patients experiencing (persistent) suicidal ideation, demonstrating that ideation is variable, and hence malleable, may provide relief.\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org 17 May 2022 | Volume 4 | Article 876595\nKivel\u00e4 et al. EMA in Suicide Research\nIn accordance with the finding that suicidal ideation variability may serve as a potential marker for increased suicide risk, this characteristic of ideation may be an especially valuable target for EMA monitoring and/or interventions in clinical practice. First applications of using EMA in clinical practice to monitor and manage symptoms are already underway (87). The extensive nature of EMA data also allows for more opportunities for single-case data analysis that may be used to examine individual symptom profiles or identify person-specific triggers (118)\u2013an important goal in the treatment of the very heterogeneous group of patients experiencing STBs (119). However, despite these considerable inter-individual differences, most studies reviewed here solely examined group-level associations, while in clinical practice, the focus is on individual patients (120). Hence, the precise utility of this methodology in clinical practice in relation to STBs remains to be established."

EMA data has revealed notable inter-individual differences in suicide symptom profiles (57), highlighting the importance of identifying meaningful subtypes of suicidal ideators that could improve risk assessments and choice of treatment targeting specific symptom profiles. However, the network theory is subject to certain pitfalls that still need to be solved before it can be implemented in clinical practice (24, 123). Next steps in EMA research may also involve intensive longitudinal assessments over longer time periods (i.e., months) in order to more reliably establish such phenotypes. Further, determining the value of such phenotyping would require\nadditional follow-up assessments connecting these symptom profiles to overt outcomes (i.e., suicide attempt, mortality) over time."

More recently, real-time methodologies have identified new potential targets for risk-detection, namely rapid changes in momentary affect, interpersonal experiences, and sleep (124). However, these observations still warrant replication. The use of EMA in suicide research has grown rapidly in the past years, and review of the literature suggests that the fluctuating nature of suicidal ideation makes it an especially suited target for EMA, which may provide unique insights into the temporal correlates and imminent warning signs of increased suicide risk. Retrospective reports can be unreliable, especially when individuals are asked to recall fleeting or highly variable experiences (61), but EMA may have increased sensitivity in detecting these momentary experiences. Meanwhile, it has been proposed that identifying instability in suicidal ideation offers promise in improving the detection of those most at risk of suicide (37, 38), and attempts have been made to create new categorizations of suicidal ideators based on real-time data (50). Such risk profiling may hence represent next steps not only in EMA research, but in the improved treatment of patients with suicidal ideation.\nFrontiers in Digital Health | www.frontiersin.org 18 May 2022 | Volume 4 | Article 876595\nKivel\u00e4 et al.
