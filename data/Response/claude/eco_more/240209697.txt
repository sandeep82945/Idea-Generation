 Here are 5 potential future research directions based on the paper:

1. Study complementary data effects between platforms. The current model assumes platforms' data are substitutes. It would be interesting to analyze cases where platforms possess complementary data that becomes more valuable when combined. This could change the dynamics and implications.

2. Incorporate platform competition through services. The model focuses on competition through data sales. Extending it to also include platform competition for users through service quality/variety could reveal additional insights. 

3. Explore alternative pricing models. The paper considers a simple pricing model where platforms sell data at a fixed price. Studying more complex pricing models like auctions or dynamic pricing could uncover new findings.

4. Examine multi-sided markets. The current model has 3 players. Expanding it to a multi-sided market with advertisers, publishers, platforms, and users could offer new perspectives. 

5. Empirically test model predictions. The theoretical model provides several predictions. Validating and calibrating these using real-world data could be an interesting direction. For instance, testing how privacy regulations have impacted platform and user behavior.
