            "text": "Anthranilate and its derivative aniline are important basic chemicals for the synthesis of\npolyurethanes as well as various dyes and food additives. Today, aniline is mainly chemically produced from petroleum-derived benzene, but it could be also obtained more sustainably by decarboxylation of the microbially produced shikimate pathway intermediate anthranilate. In this study, Corynebacterium glutamicum was engineered for the microbial production of anthranilate from a carbon source mixture of glucose and xylose. First, a feedback-resistant 3-deoxyarabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase from E. coli, catalyzing the first step of the shikimate pathway, was functionally introduced into C. glutamicum to enable anthranilate production. Modulation of the translation efficiency of the genes for the shikimate kinase (aroK) and the anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (trpD) improved product formation. Deletion of two genes, one for a putative phosphatase (nagD) and one for a quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase (qsuD), abolished by-product formation of glycerol and quinate. However, the introduction of an engineered anthranilate synthase (TrpEG) unresponsive to feedback inhibition by tryptophan had the most pronounced effect on anthranilate production. Component I of this enzyme (TrpE) was engineered using a biosensor-based in vivo screening strategy for identifying variants with increased feedback-resistance in a semi-rational library of TrpE muteins. The final strain accumulated up to 5.9 g/L (43 mM) anthranilate in defined CGXII medium from a mixture of glucose and xylose in bioreactor cultivations. We believe that the constructed C. glutamicum variants are not only limited to anthranilate production, but could also be suitable for the synthesis of other biotechnologically interesting shikimate pathway intermediates, or any other aromatic compound derived thereof.\nKeywords: anthranilate, Corynebacterium glutamicum, metabolic engineering, xylose, anthranilate synthase, shikimate pathway, feedback inhibition, site-saturation mutagenesis, biosensor"

            "text": "Aromatic compounds have a wide range of applications in the chemical, pharmaceutical,\nor food industries where they serve as polymer building blocks, dyes, food additives, or antibiotics (Balderas-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2009; Chung, 2016; Noreen et al., 2016). However, the chemical production of these compounds at an industrial scale is typically based on benzene, toluene, or xylene (BTX) derived from crude oil (Haveren et al., 2007). One of the key aromatic platform chemicals is aniline with a global market volume of 9.4 million tons in 2022, which is expected to increase to more than 12 million tons by 2028 with an annual growth rate of 5.2 % (IMARC Group 2023: \u201cAniline Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2023-2028\u201d). Three quarters of the aniline produced globally is used for the synthesis of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), a monomer building block for polyurethane (PU), which in turn is a polymer utilized in the manufacturing of foam, elastomers, paints, adhesives or artificial leather (Driessen et al., 2017; Nakajima-Kambe et al., 1999). Aniline is mainly produced chemically from benzene, which is initially converted to nitrobenzene with nitric acid. (Bolden et al., 2015). Subsequently, the nitro functionality is reduced to the primary amine in the gas phase at 270\u00b0C and 1.25 bar employing a copper catalyst. This process releases 25 Mt CO2 and consumes 0.3 EJ energy annually (Winter et al., 2021).\nHowever, aniline could be also produced in a more sustainable manner using the\nmetabolic capabilities of microorganisms. This biotechnological process involves the microbial production of anthranilate (ANT), which can be subsequently converted to aniline by chemical decarboxylation. Besides aniline, ANT is also the precursor of other aromatic compounds of biotechnological interest such as methyl anthranilate (MANT) conveying the typical scent and taste of the Concord grape (Vitis labrusca) (Chambers et al., 2013; Fuleki, 1972; Wang & Luca, 2005). Another derivative is menthyl anthranilate, which serves as a UV-A quencher in sunscreens (Beeby & Jones, 2000). ANT is an intermediate of the shikimate (SA) pathway, which\nis responsible for the synthesis of the three aromatic amino acids (TYR, PHE, TRP), as well as secondary metabolites in plants, fungi, and many microorganisms (Lee & Wendisch, 2017) (Fig. 1).\nThe first step in the synthesis of aromatic compounds via the SA pathway is the\ncondensation of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), a metabolite of the non-oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), an intermediate of glycolysis, yielding 3-deoxy-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) (Herrmann & Weaver,\n1999). The reaction is catalyzed by DAHP synthase, which is allosterically regulated (Liao et al., 2001; Shumilin et al., 1996). After seven enzymatic conversions, the SA pathway bifurcates at the stage of chorismate, eventually leading to PHE, TYR and TRP. The first committed step towards TRP biosynthesis is catalyzed by the anthranilate synthase (ANS) converting chorismate to ANT and pyruvate, using GLN as an amino donor (yielding GLU) (Romero et al., 1995).\nThe microbial production of ANT was established in a few bacterial species. A\nPseudomonas putida KT2440 strain accumulated 1.54 g/L (11.23 mM) ANT in a defined medium with glucose as a carbon source using a fed-batch process (Kuepper et al., 2015). In addition, a plasmid-free strain of P. putida was constructed, which produced 3.8 mM ANT in shake flasks from glucose without the supplementation of additives (Fern\u00e1ndez-Cabez\u00f3n et al., 2022). Higher ANT titers were only achieved by using expensive complex media. A Bacillus subtilis strain produced 3.5 g/L (25 mM) ANT using yeast extract and glucose as substrates within 60 h, whereas an engineered Escherichia coli variant accumulated 14 g/L (102 mM) ANT after 34 h in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 10 g/L of yeast extract and 30 g/L glucose followed by two pulses containing the same carbon source composition (Balderas-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2009; Cooper et al., 1995). Moreover, a titer of 567.9 mg/L (4.1 mM) ANT was achieved with Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a complex SCD medium, which is the highest ANT titer reached using a eukaryotic host (Kuivanen et al., 2021). Furthermore, MANT was produced from ANT with C. glutamicum using fed-batch cultures and a two-phase cultivation mode with a maximum titer of 5.74 g/L (38 mM) MANT (Luo et al., 2019). In the context of this study, the first ANT-production with C. glutamicum was described. The best variant accumulated up to 26.4 g/L (192.5 mM) ANT. However, to achieve such high product titers. the ANT-producing C. glutamicum strain was made auxotrophic for TRP and thus required TRP-supplementation every 24 h.\nANT, similar to most other aromatics, is known to have antimicrobial properties, potentially\nlimiting the microbial production of this compound (Li et al., 2017). C. glutamicum is used for the\nindustrial production of proteinogenic amino acids such as GLU and LYS at a scale of more than five million tons per year (Eggeling & Bott, 2005). This gram-positive soil bacterium is free of endotoxins and products derived from C. glutamicum are therefore generally recognized as safe (Zha et al., 2018). In addition, several C. glutamicum variants engineered for aromatic compounds such as hydroxybenzoic acids, phenylpropanoids, or plant polyphenols are available demonstrating that C. glutamicum is a robust host system capable of enduring increased concentrations of cytotoxic aromatics (Kallscheuer et al., 2016; Kallscheuer & Marienhagen, 2018; Milke et al., 2019; Son et al., 2021).\nIn addition to a wide product range, C. glutamicum can metabolize various cheap carbon\nsources. Frequently, glucose and fructose are used as carbon and energy source for applied purposes (Blombach & Seibold, 2010). However, as the utilization of these sugars in biotechnological processes competes with food production, it is highly desirable to resort to other substrates, preferably from waste streams, such as cellobiose, arabinose, and xylose (Jiang & Zhang, 2016; Kawaguchi et al., 2006; Kotrba et al., 2003; Schneider et al., 2011). Since C. glutamicum cannot utilize xylose naturally, several different pathways such as the isomerase pathway or the Weimberg pathway were implemented into the metabolism of this bacterium (Kawaguchi et al., 2006; Meiswinkel et al., 2013; Radek et al., 2014). In this context, C. glutamicum was engineered to produce several compounds such as protocatechuate, succinate, or \u03b1-ketoglutarate from xylose or glucose/xylose mixtures (Br\u00fcsseler et al., 2019; Labib et al., 2021; Tenhaef et al., 2021). Noteworthy, xylose utilization via the isomerase pathway has the advantage of providing the SA pathway precursor E4P (Kogure et al., 2016).\nThis study aimed to establish microbial ANT production with C. glutamicum from different\ncarbon sources (and mixtures) by combining rational metabolic engineering strategies with biosensor-guided semi-rational enzyme engineering."

C. glutamicum strains were\ncultivated aerobically at 30\u00b0C in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, USA) or in defined CGXII medium supplemented with either 4 % (w/v) glucose or a mixture of 1 % (w/v) glucose and 3 % (w/v) xylose as sole carbon and energy source (Keilhauer et al., 1993).\nFor cultivation of C. glutamicum, test tubes with 5 mL BHI medium supplemented with the\nappropriate antibiotic were inoculated with a single colony from a fresh BHI agar plate. These first precultures were grown for 8 h on a rotary shaker at 170 rpm. The entire precultures were used to inoculate the second precultures, which consisted of 50 mL defined CGXII medium supplemented with the respective carbon source in 500 mL baffled flasks. These second precultures were cultivated overnight on a rotary shaker at 130 rpm. Bacterial growth was tracked by measuring the optical cell density at 600 nm (OD600). CGXII main cultures with the indicated carbon source were inoculated to an OD600 of 1 from these second precultures. Strains utilized in this study are equipped with the chromosomally integrated gene 1 encoding the T7 RNA polymerase enabling gene expression from the IPTG-inducible T7 promotor (Kortmann et al., 2015). Thus, for ANT production, heterologous and homologous gene expression was induced 1 h after inoculation with 20 \u00b5M IPTG. At defined time points, 1 mL of the culture broth was sampled, and centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 20 min and the culture supernatant was stored at - 20\u00b0C until HPLC analysis.\nTo determine the cytotoxic effect of ANT on bacterial growth, C. glutamicum was cultivated\nat 30\u00b0C, 900 rpm, and a humidity of 85 % in 48-well Flowerplates containing 800 \u00b5L defined CGXII medium with 0.5 % (w/v) glucose inoculated to an OD600 of 1 by using the BioLector microbioreactor for 24 h (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Aachen, Germany). Increasing concentrations of ANT (final concentration of 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12 g/L) were added to\nthe medium. A 200 g/L ANT stock solution, dissolved in H2O was prepared and the pH was adjusted to 7 by using a 1 M NaOH solution. As the stock solution could not be concentrated higher due to the low solubility of ANT in water (5.7 g/L (41.7 mM) at 25 \u00b0C), the maximum ANT concentration in defined CGXII medium was 12 g/L. To monitor bacterial growth, the backscattered light intensity (620 nm, gain 10) was followed.\nE. coli DH5\u03b1 was utilized for molecular cloning and plasmid propagation, while E. coli\nTOP10 was used for the construction of strain libraries. Cultivation of E. coli strains was routinely performed in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium (10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L NaCl, 5 g/L yeast extract) or yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium at 37 \u00b0C (Bertani, 1951). For the preparation of 1 L YNB medium, 100 mL 10x concentrated YNB supplemented with 5.1 % (v/v) glycerol was added to 900 mL YNB base (6 g/L K2HPO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 10 g/L 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) pH 7). For the LEU auxotroph E. coli DH10B-derived strains, 2 mM LEU was supplemented from a 20 mM LEU stock solution in the YNB base (Durfee et al., 2008). Where necessary, kanamycin (E. coli: 50 \u00b5g/mL in LB medium and 25 \u00b5g/mL in YNB medium; C. glutamicum: 25 \u00b5g/mL for cultivations, 15 \u00b5g/mL for colony selection after transformation) and/or spectinomycin (100 \u00b5g/mL for both, E. coli and C. glutamicum) was added to the medium."

Subsequently, these precultures were split and 5 mL of each preculture was used for inoculation of two second precultures, which consisted of 100 mL defined CGXII medium supplemented with either 1 % glucose and 3 % xylose (batch mode) or 4 % glucose (fed-batch mode) in 1 L baffled flasks, which were incubated at 30 \u00b0C and 250 rpm for 24 h. For inoculation of the main culture, the second precultures were centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C. The supernatants were discarded and the cells were washed in 20 mL 0.9 % NaCl. The cells of\nthe two second precultures were merged, the washing step was repeated and the cells were resuspended in 5 mL 0.9 % NaCl. Finally, OD600 was measured and bioreactors were inoculated to an initial OD600 of 1.\nBatch and pulsed-fed-batch bioreactor fermentations were performed in duplicates in\nDASGIP bioreactor systems (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with a total volume of 2 L and an initial working volume of 1 L with four simultaneously operated reactors. Cells were cultivated in defined CGXII medium without urea and MOPS supplemented with 1 % glucose and 3 % xylose during the batch cultivations. For the fed-batch cultivations, 4 % glucose for initial biomass formation was used as a carbon source. After 14.5 h, glucose was depleted and a constant glucose feed started with a rate of 0.5 g/h. Simultaneously, the first 10 g xylose pulse was added from a 50 % xylose stock solution. Subsequently, xylose was pulsed after 18.75 h (10 g), 21.75 h (10 g), 37.42 h (10 g), 41.42 h(10 g), 45.42 h (20 g), 62.83 h (10 g), 66.25 h (10 g) and 69.75 h (20 g). After inoculation, 2 mL sterile antifoam was added and plasmid-based gene expression was induced with 20 \u00b5M IPTG after 1 h. The temperature was set to 30 \u00b0C and the pH was maintained at 7 by both-sided regulation with 5 M H2PO4 and 25 % NH4OH. Dissolved oxygen (dO2) was fixed to a minimum of 30 % using a cascade. The cascade first increased agitation from 400 to 1,200 rpm, followed by the airflow, which was increased from 6 to 40 sL/h if necessary. The cultivations were terminated after the complete depletion of the carbon sources. Samples were taken at defined time points, centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was stored at -20 \u00b0C until ANT, glucose, and xylose quantification via HPLC. Data from bioreactor experiments in batch mode were modeled using Monod kinetics to describe growth of biomass, consumption of glucose and xylose consumption, and production of anthranilate. Specific dynamics of xylose utilization were modelled by considering additional inhibition by glucose. For model implementation, validation and analysis we used the open-source, python-based modeling tool pyFOOMB (Hemmerich et al., 2021)."

Genes and chromosomal fragments required for plasmid construction were amplified by PCR using genomic C. glutamicum DNA or whole cells as a template. Oligonucleotides are listed in Tab. S2. PCR fragments were cloned into plasmid vectors by Gibson assembly (Gibson et al., 2009). Gene deletions and the introduction of point mutations or whole genes in the genome of C. glutamicum were achieved by employing a two-step homologous recombination method described previously (Niebisch & Bott, 2001; Sch\u00e4fer et al., 1994). Colony PCR, restriction analysis, and DNA sequencing performed at Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany) were used to verify plasmid constructions and the identity of recombinant C. glutamicum strains. Transformation of C. glutamicum with constructed plasmids was performed by electroporation (Kirchner & Tauch, 2003).\nFor site-saturation mutagenesis (SSM), plasmid pJC1-trpE (7749 bp) was amplified by\nPCR using oligonucleotides with degenerated (NNK) codons (NEB Q5 Site-Directed-Mutagenesis Kit, New England Biolabs, GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany).

After PCR amplification, the parental plasmid was removed and the plasmids were constructed by a kinase-ligase-DpnI (KLD) reaction according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The resulting plasmid libraries were used for heat shock transformation of chemically competent One Shot TOP10 E. coli cells. All resulting transformants were detached from LB agar plates and used for inoculation of 50 mL LB medium in 500 mL baffled shake flasks, which were cultivated on a rotary shaker at 37\u00b0 for 6 h before plasmid isolation using a Midi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

Due to the deletion of the genomic trpE gene, the strains were TRP auxotroph, so 0.5 mM TRP was always supplemented. By following this strategy, similar growth of all cultivated variants was ensured. The cultivations were performed in a Multitron Pro HT Incubator (Infors AG, Bottmingen, Switzerland) at 30 \u00b0C, 900 rpm, 75 % humidity, and 3 mm throw for 16 h. After the addition of 30 % (v/v) glycerol, the C. glutamicum strain variants were stored at -80 \u00b0C until use.\n50 \u00b5L of fresh glycerol cultures were used for inoculation of BHIG precultures in 48-well\nFlowerplates with a total volume of 800 \u00b5L.

The main cultures (CGXII + 4 % glucose) were inoculated with 50 \u00b5L of the grown CGXII precultures and incubated for 72 h under the same conditions. To harvest culture supernatants containing ANT, the entire cultures were transferred into organic solvent-resistant deep-well plates, which were subsequently centrifuged (3,500 rpm, 20 min, 4\u00b0C). Cell-free culture supernatants were stored at -20\u00b0C until their biosensor-based characterization. For the correlation of specific fluorescence and ANT concentration, selected variants displaying higher, equal, or lower specific fluorescence compared to the control were also analyzed by HPLC (Tab.

This strain served as starting strain for rational metabolic engineering to establish microbial ANT synthesis with C. glutamicum. However, prior to any engineering, the robustness of C. glutamicum to ANT was investigated. For these experiments, C. glutamicum DelAro5 PO6iolT1 was cultivated in the presence of 0-12 g/L ANT in microtiter plates (MTPs) (Fig. 2A). These experiments showed that the growth of C. glutamicum DelAro5 PO6-iolT1 was negatively affected with increasing ANT concentrations starting from the lowest concentration of 0.5 g/L (3.65 mM) ANT. ANT supplementation resulted in a prolonged lag phase and a reduced growth rate (Fig. 2B). At the highest concentration of 12 g/L (87.5 mM) ANT, the strain was still able to grow with a maximal growth rate of 0.1 h-1, which is 50 % of the maximal growth rate determined for the control (\u00b5max = 0.2 h-1) indicating that C. glutamicum DelAro5 PO6-iolT1 is capable of tolerating high ANT concentrations.\nHeterologous expression of a gene encoding a feedback-resistant DAHP synthase is an\nestablished strategy for the microbial production of SA-derived compounds (Balderas-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2009). In this study, the codon-optimized gene aroF*EcCg encoding a DAHP synthase from E. coli was selected, which was previously engineered to be feedback-resistant to TYR (Zhang et al., 2014). Furthermore, increased transketolase activity was described to be associated with aromatic amino acid synthesis due to the increased carbon flux through the SA pathway, providing more E4P (Ikeda, 2006). For this reason, tkt encoding the transketolase from C. glutamicum was\nalso selected for plasmid-based homologous overexpression. With the aim to increase the translation efficiency of tkt, the native TTG-start codon was replaced by ATG. Both genes, aroF*EcCg and tkt were cloned as a bicistronic operon on the pMKEx2-plasmid yielding pMKEx2aroF*EcCg-tktCg, which allows for IPTG-inducible expression under the control of the strong T7 promotor (Kortmann et al., 2015). This plasmid was transformed into C. glutamicum DelAro5 PO6iolT1 GTG-trpD (ANT1) in which the ATG-start codon of the genome-encoded trpD-gene was replaced by a GTG to reduce the initial translation efficiency of this gene. The trpD-gene product, essential for growth, is the anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts ANT to N-(5phosphoribosyl)-anthranilate and is thus withdrawing ANT for TRP synthesis (O\u2019Gara & Dunican, 1995). The resulting strain C. glutamicum ANT1 pMKEx2-aroF*EcCg-tktCg and suitable control strains were cultivated in shake flasks with glucose as the sole carbon and energy source (Fig. 2C, D). Samples of the culture supernatants were analyzed for ANT production by HPLC. Neither C. glutamicum ANT1 nor the strain carrying the empty vector produced detectable amounts of ANT (Fig. 2D). The strain capable of plasmid-based aroF*EcCg - and tktCg-expression accumulated 287.6 \u00b1 14.1 mg/L (2.1 mM) ANT within 24 h (Fig. 2D).\nHowever, in addition to ANT, the accumulation of an additional compound was detected\nduring HPLC analysis. The shorter retention time did hint towards the previously described formation of glycosyl-anthranilate in the presence of catalytically active cations such as ammonium, which is a component of the defined CGXII medium used (Kuepper et al., 2020). Hence, glycosyl-anthranilate or its Amadori product fructosyl-anthranilate might be formed, the latter being characterized by the same absorption spectrum in the UV range as ANT (Fig. S1A, B). Since no analytical standard of this compound was available, ANT was dissolved in CGXII medium with and without glucose and incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 72 h. HPLC analysis showed indeed that the putative glycosyl-anthranilate peak only emerged in the presence of glucose, whereas the area of the ANT peak decreased simultaneously.\nSamples of the culture supernatants were also examined by GC-TOF MS to detect the\npossible formation of other by-products. (Fig. S2). These analyses showed that glycerol accumulated as a by-product. Since glycerol, but also QA, are known by-products typically accumulating during the microbial production of SA pathway-derived products, genes responsible for the formation of these compounds were deleted (Kogure et al., 2016). The gene nagD encodes the putative phosphatase HdpA, involved in the formation of dihydroxyacetone, the precursor of glycerol (Jojima et al., 2012). The gene qsuD encodes the QA/SA dehydrogenase QsuD, which catalyzes the first step of QA/SA catabolism (Fig. 1). By deletion of qsuD, the conversion of 3- dehydroquinate (DHQ) to QA and also the undesired back reaction of SA to 3-dehydroshikimate (DHS) could be prevented (Teramoto et al., 2009). Hence, respective deletion strains of C. glutamicum ANT1 were constructed, which differ from the parent strain by in-frame deletion of nagD, qsuD, or both genes. The effect on ANT production was investigated by the cultivation of all constructed deletion strains in shake flasks (Fig. S3). Neither the deletion of nagD, qsuD nor both genes in combination had a negative effect on growth and maximum cell density was reached after 13 h for all strains, whereupon product formation set in. This indicated a growthdecoupled formation of ANT from glucose. The product titer of the single deletion strains was not increased compared to the control. However, the double deletion strain C. glutamicum ANT1 \u0394nagD \u0394qsuD (ANT2) pMKEx2-aroF*EcCg-tktCg achieved a higher average ANT titer determined to be 294 \u00b1 11.9 mg/L (2.2 mM) ANT (Fig. S3B)."

            "text": "In order to enable ANT production also from xylose, the xylose isomerase pathway was\nintroduced into C. glutamicum ANT2 pMKEx2-aroF*EcCg-tktCg via the plasmid pEKEx3-xylAXcxylBCg (Meiswinkel et al., 2013). The xylAXc-encoded xylose isomerase from Xanthomonas campestris and the xylBCg-encoded xylulokinase from C. glutamicum catalyze the conversion of xylose to xylulose-5-phosphate, which is a readily metabolizable intermediate of the non-oxidative\npart of the PPP. This in turn could increase the availability of the DAHP synthase substrate E4P. The ability of the strains to utilize xylose as a carbon source was investigated and the effect of xylose utilization on ANT production was tested by the cultivation of C. glutamicum ANT2 harboring both expression plasmids in shake flasks with a mixture of glucose and xylose (Fig. S4). By using a mixed carbon substrate of 1 % glucose and 3 % xylose, the cultures reached optical densities of 50 within 20 h (Fig. S4A), while higher optical densities of 70 were reached with 4 % glucose as the sole carbon source within 13 h. However, from the glucose/xylose mixture, ANT could be produced at a g/L scale with an average titer of 2 g/L (14.6 mM) ANT (Fig. S4B). Interestingly, ANT accumulation started before the cells entered the stationary growth phase in these cultivations, whereas product formation with glucose as the sole carbon source occurred in a growth-decoupled manner. Subsequently, the effects of different glucose/xylose ratios were investigated (Fig. S5). These experiments showed that ANT formation increased with increasing concentrations of xylose and decreasing glucose concentrations. Growth and product formation from xylose as the sole carbon and energy source was possible, but did not prove to be beneficial since the strains were characterized by a prolonged lag phase reaching overall lower cell densities and reduced maximum ANT titers of 1 \u00b1 0.14 g/L (7.42 mM). Of all glucose/xylose ratios tested, the initially tested 1 % glucose / 3 % xylose mixture yielded the most ANT. Furthermore, C. glutamicum ANT2 harboring the isomerase pathway was also cultivated with 4 % glucose as the sole carbon source. Surprisingly, this strain produced up to 461.3 \u00b1 22.7 mg/L (3.4 mM) ANT within 24 h, whereas the strain without expression of xylAXc and xylBCg accumulated only 370.4 \u00b1 14.3 mg/L (2.7 mM) ANT. Since the plasmid pEKEx3-xylAXc-xylBCg had a positive effect on product formation, it was used in all subsequent experiments with glucose as the sole carbon source along with pMKEx2-aroF*EcCg-tktCg. Noteworthy, in addition to the formation of glycosylanthranilate in the presence of glucose, another peak with a shorter retention time and identical absorption properties as ANT emerged during HPLC analyses of all cultures with glucose/xylose\nmixtures. This peak could have been evoked by the presence of xylosyl-anthranilate, as it only occurred when xylose was used as a cosubstrate (Fig. S6).\nPreviously, a S38R-substitution was described in the ANS of Brevibacterium\nlactofermentum (C. glutamicum ssp. lactofermentum), which desensitizes this enzyme to intracellular TRP-concentrations of up to 10 mM (Matsui et al., 1987). With the aim to improve the flux towards ANT, the same point mutation was also introduced into trpE of C. glutamicum ANT2, yielding C. glutamicum ANT2 ANS-S38R (C. glutamicum ANT3). This variant was transformed with the respective plasmids enabling ANT synthesis and cultivated in shake flasks with 4 % glucose and 1 % glucose / 3 % xylose carbon source mixtures (Fig. 3). C. glutamicum ANT2 pMKEx2-aroF*EcCg-tktCg pEKEx3-xylAXc-xylBCg accumulated 355.3 \u00b1 36.1 mg/L (2.59 mM) ANT from glucose within 24 h, while the ANT titer determined for the strain harboring ANS-S38R was almost doubled (624.2 \u00b1 64.5 mg/L (4.55 mM) ANT). Using a mixture of glucose and xylose, C. glutamicum ANT3 pMKEx2-aroF*EcCg-tktCg pEKEx3-xylAXc-xylBCg reached a maximum product titer of 2.9 \u00b1 0.39 g/L (21.04 mM) ANT, meaning that the product titer could be increased by almost 1 g/L compared to the variant with the wild-type ANS.\nNoteworthy, a major by-product identified quantitatively by GC-TOF-MS analysis of the\nculture supernatants of the C. glutamicum ANT3 strains was SA, indicating that the ATPdependent phosphorylation of SA to S3P might be a bottleneck within the SA pathway at this stage of metabolic engineering. In C. glutamicum, this step is catalyzed by SA kinase encoded by aroK (Syukur Purwanto et al., 2018). To reduce the accumulation of SA and thus increase the carbon flux through the SA pathway, the initial translation efficiency of aroK was increased by a start codon replacement in aroK (GTGATG). The resulting strain C. glutamicum ANT3 ATG-\naroK (C. glutamicum ANT4) was transformed with the production plasmids and cultivated in shake flasks to investigate the effect of the start codon exchange on ANT and SA titer (Fig. S7). The cultivations with glucose as the sole carbon and energy source showed that the start codon replacement did not greatly affect the overall ANT titer, but could reduce the amount of SA accumulated within 24 h by more than 65 % (16.2 \u00b1 2.6 mg/L (0.1 mM) SA vs. 46.5 \u00b1 8.7 mg/L (0.3 mM) SA). However, towards the end of the cultivation, the same SA concentration of 10 mg/L (0.1 mM) could be determined in the supernatant of both strain variants. In contrast, the C. glutamicum ANT3 variant cultivated on a glucose/xylose mixture accumulated 374.7 \u00b1 6.6 mg/L (2.2 mM) SA within 24 h. Here the aroK start codon replacement could reduce the SA concentration only by 14.6 % to 320.6 \u00b1 20.4 mg/L (1.8 mM) SA.\n3.4 Biosensor-guided engineering of the anthranilate synthase of C. glutamicum\nThe introduction of the feedback-relieved ANS-S38R\u2013variant proved to be a key\nmodification for high ANT production with C. glutamicum in this study. However, with the aim to find out whether the feedback inhibition could be further reduced, we set out to identify additional amino acid residues in the ANS, which are essential for TRP-mediated feedback inhibition. The ANS from Salmonella typhimurium shows 47.9 % homology to the enzyme of C. glutamicum and a previous study indicated that amino acid residues E39, S40, M293, F294, and C465 of this enzyme are associated with feedback-inhibition by TRP (Morollo & Eck, 2001). Since four residues are also conserved in the ANS from C. glutamicum (E37, S38, M285, and C461), improved ANS variants with an increased TRP-feedback resistance might be obtainable.\nIn order to access such ANS variants, the codons for the residues E37, S38, M285, and\nC461 of an episomally encoded trpE-gene of C. glutamicum were targeted by SSM, and the resulting libraries were subjected to a biosensor-based in vivo-screening in MTPs. Prior to these experiments, the genome-encoded trpE was deleted for screening purposes to avoid cross-talk with the native ANS. This trpE-deficient strain required TRP-supplementation in the defined CGXII\nmedium but episomal trpE expression could restore growth (Fig. S8). Subsequently, four individual SSM libraries of trpE encoded on a pJC1-plasmid were generated using NNKdegenerated oligonucleotides. Noteworthy, before transformation of the pJC1-plasmids carrying the mutated ANS-variants, aroF*EcCg was integrated into the intergenic region (IGR09) between cg0432 and cg0435 in the genome of C. glutamicum, since the pJC1- and the pMKEx2-plasmids are incompatible. The resulting C. glutamicum ANT4 IGR9::PdapA(A16)-aroF*EcCg (C. glutamicum ANT5) variant allowed for the formation of 380 \u00b1 17.1 mg/L (2.8 mM) ANT from glucose within 24 h. Hence this strain is inferior to the C. glutamicum ANT4 strain enabling plasmid-based expression of aroF*EcCg and tkt, but suitable for the envisioned ANS-screening (for details of the conducted strain characterization, the reader is referred to the supplementary material, Fig. S9). After transformation, 150 variants for each library, corresponding to a theoretical library completeness of 95.5 % (GLUE-IT algorithm (Firth & Patrick, 2008)), were screened.\nThe pSenCA biosensor for the intracellular detection of cinnamic acid and phenylpropionic\nacid in E. coli was previously engineered to also detect other small aromatic molecules of biotechnological interest (Flachbart et al., 2021, 2019). One of these customized biosensor variants is pSen6MSA, engineered for the detection of 6-methylsalicylic acid (6MSA). Due to the structural similarity of ANT and 6MSA (Fig. 1, 4A), we assumed that this biosensor might also recognize ANT, which would make an E. coli strain bearing this sensor a screening tool for the detection of ANT-accumulating C. glutamicum variants. To test the applicability of pSen6MSA for this purpose, E. coli DH10B \u2206hcaREFCBD pSen6MSA was cultivated in the presence of 0-20 mM ANT or C. glutamicum culture supernatants containing 0-2 mM microbially produced ANT (Fig. S10, S11). ANT could indeed induce the biosensor and the optimum inducer concentration was determined to be 0.6 mM ANT. Higher ANT concentrations resulted in impaired growth of the E. coli strain restricting the overall fluorescence. Since up to 1.8 mM SA typically accumulate in\nsupernatants of ANT-producing C. glutamicum cultures, it was further examined if SA can also act as an inducer of the pSen6MSA. However, no specific fluorescence was observed upon the addition of 0-20 mM SA, indicating that no cross-talk was to be expected (Fig. S12).\nFor screening, all 600 clones of the four site-saturated C. glutamicum ANT5 \u2206trpE libraries\nwere individually cultivated in MTPs for ANT production. Subsequently, culture supernatants were transferred to a second MTP with cultures of the pSen6MSA bearing E. coli sensor strain for the semi-quantitative detection of ANT. For a detailed analysis, ANT concentrations in the supernatant of the controls and of three clones with lower, equal, or higher specific fluorescence of each library screened were determined by HPLC (Tab. S3-6). In the case of the ANS-E37x, only a few variants showed an increased fluorescence response, but the DNA-sequencing of these clones only returned wild-type trpE sequences (Fig. S13). Screening of the ANS-M285x library yielded a few variants with an increased biosensor response (Fig. S15). However, a detailed HPLC analysis of the supernatants indicated an equal or lower ANT titer so DNA sequencing was omitted (Tab. S5). Most clones reached the same fluorescence as the control, which suggested that ANS-M285 might not be important for feedback inhibition. The biosensorbased screening of the ANS-S38x library identified three clones with an increased fluorescence signal (Fig. S14). Interestingly, DNA sequencing revealed S38A and S38G substitutions, and the already known S38R substitution could not be retrieved. Finally, screening of the ANS-C461x library yielded 15 variants with an increased biosensor response (Fig. 4B). DNA-sequencing revealed that all trpE-variants were characterized by mutations leading to a C461G substitution, suggesting that this amino acid residue is indeed important for feedback inhibition.\nSubsequently, the two mutations leading to the two amino acid substitutions ANS-S38A\nand ANS-S38G were individually introduced into the genome of C. glutamicum ANT5 to confirm the positive effects on ANT production in shake flask cultivations in comparison to the previously introduced ANS-S38R substitution (Fig. S16). Growth of all strain variants was indistinguishable and all variants reached a similar ANT titer of 2.7-2.9 g/L (19.7-20.8 mM) after 32 h. Subsequently, the mutation ANS-C461G was combined with the previously introduced ANSS38R/A/G mutation to identify any synergistic effects of pairwise trpE-mutation on product formation (Fig. 5). All strains reached a final OD600 of 45-50 after 24 h (Fig 5A). For all ANS double mutants, a slightly increased ANT titer could be determined in comparison to the respective S38X variant after 48 h. Although this effect was neglectable at the end of each cultivation, the observed\nfaster product formation hints indeed towards a combinatorial effect of both mutations in all mutated ANSs (Fig. 5 B-D)."

In the batch mode, C. glutamicum ANT6 reached a maximum OD600 of 53.9 \u00b1 0.9 after 23.3 h, before the optical\ndensity of the culture dropped slightly over the course of the cultivation. ANT production set in after 12 h of cultivation time and was finished after 27.9 h with a maximum product titer of 2.6 \u00b1 0.02 g/L (19.1 mM). Modelling of the resulting data indicated a diauxic behavior of C. glutamicum ANT6, first consuming glucose exclusively for biomass formation, followed by xylose utilization solely for ANT production (Tab.

The low product yield of only 0.06 gANT gXYL-1 can be explained by the accumulation of side products, predominantly SA.\nDuring fed-batch mode, C. glutamicum ANT6 was first cultivated with glucose in batch\ncultivation for initial biomass formation, followed by a constant glucose feed and xylose pulses at defined time points. Again, the strain showed the diauxic behavior already observed during batch mode cultivation, but product formation of C. glutamicum ANT6 continued after the last xylose pulse.

            "text": "In this study, the microbial production of ANT with C. glutamicum was established,\nemploying rational and semi-rational engineering strategies. Initial experiments on product toxicity were performed due to known antimicrobial properties of ANT (Csonka, 1989; Li et al., 2017). However, only a minor effect of ANT on the growth of C. glutamicum was observed, making this organism a more suitable host for the production of ANT than P. putida, which cannot grow at ANT concentrations exceeding 10 g/L (72.92 mM) (Kuepper et al., 2015).\nIn order to avoid the formation of possible by-products, the genes nagD and qsuD were\ndeleted, whose gene products are involved in the synthesis of glycerol and QA (Jojima et al., 2012; Teramoto et al., 2009). Single deletion of nagD or qsuD had no impact on ANT production, only the double deletion increased the product titer significantly. Deletion of nagD might lead to increased availability of NADPH, which in turn could be used by qsuD-encoded NADPHdependent QA/SA dehydrogenase to form QA, resulting in no increased ANT titer (Jojima et al., 2012). Glycerol and QA both could not be detected in the culture supernatant by HPLC although the formation of glycerol has been already described during SA-synthesis with C. glutamicum (Kogure et al., 2016). However, in the context of this particular study, glycerol accumulation was only detectable during cultivations in which SA titers exceeding 100 g/L were obtained. Hence, glycerol and QA concentrations present in the culture supernatants of the C. glutamicum strains constructed in this study might have been below the detection limit.\nInitially, low ANT titers obtained in cultivations with glucose as sole carbon and energy\nsource, could be markedly increased when using glucose/xylose mixtures since xylose is rapidly converted to E4P via the isomerase pathway and reactions of the PPP (Radek et al., 2014). This in turn increased the carbon flux through the SA pathway, which was also evident from the observed accumulation of the central SA pathway intermediate SA. Utilization of this mixed carbon substrate allowed for the production of ANT at g/L scale, outperforming ANT synthesis\nwith P. putida (1.5 g/L (10 mM) ANT) (Kuepper et al., 2015). The maximum ANT titer reached in pulsed-fed-batch bioreactors with C. glutamicum was 5.9 \u00b1 1.4 g/L (43.3 mM), which exceeded the ANT titer determined for B. subtilis (3.5 g/L (26 mM)), but was lower compared to previous experiments with E. coli (14 g/L (102 mM)) (Balderas-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2009; Cooper et al., 1995). However, these high product titers were achieved in complex media limiting the comparability of the obtained results. Noteworthy, we observed an increased product formation in cultivations with glucose as the sole carbon source when genes for the heterologous isomerase pathway for xylose utilization were episomally expressed. In general, xylose isomerases are known to have a rather broad substrate spectrum also accepting glucose as a substrate, which is isomerized to fructose (Blow et al., 1992; Tsumura & Sato, 1965). Subsequently, fructose is exported and re-imported by the fructose-specific phosphotransferase system yielding fructose1-phosphate, which then enters glycolysis after phosphorylation to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Dominguez & Lindley, 1996; Ikeda, 2012). Thus, the xylose isomerase side activity might increase glucose utilization via glycolysis in the performed cultivations.\nDuring previous engineering of E. coli, P. putida and C. glutamicum for ANT\noverproduction, trpD was deleted to increase ANT accumulation (Balderas-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2009; Kuepper et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2019). However, we favored the replacement of the ATG start codon of trpD by GTG to reduce the translation efficiency to avoid any requirement for TRP supplementation, which is inevitable when deleting this essential gene.\nAs was the case with the DAHP synthase, removing the feedback inhibition of the key\nenzyme ANS was one of the decisive factors to improve product formation. A similar strategy was pursued regarding the microbial synthesis of ANT with P. putida, expressing trpES40G from E. coli, which was achieved via plasmid-based expression (Kuepper et al., 2015). The performed biosensor-based screening of focused libraries for ANS variants with further reduced feedbackinhibition showed that the obtained S38A/G substitutions had the same effect as the previously\ndescribed S38R substitution, which confirms the assumption that the hydroxy group of the native SER residue is essential for TRP binding (Matsui et al., 1987). The other amino acid substitution leading to relieved TRP-mediated feedback inhibition was C461G. In combination with S38A or S38G, this novel amino acid substitution had a positive additive effect on ANT accumulation, indicating that the degree of feedback-resistance can be gradually adjusted by substitutions of more than one key residue.\nBatch and pulsed-fed-batch cultivations of C. glutamicum ANT6 showed an interesting\ndiauxic growth/production behavior during which glucose was first metabolized and used for biomass formation. Subsequently, xylose was consumed and channeled towards ANT production and by-product formation. Noteworthy, C. glutamicum is known for its ability to cometabolize glucose with acetate, lactate or fructose among others (Cocaign et al., 1993; Dominguez et al., 1998, 1997). The only known examples of diauxic substrate consumption of C. glutamicum are the sequential metabolism of glucose before glutamate and glucose before ethanol (Arndt et al., 2008; Kr\u00e4mer et al., 1990). However, in case of the engineered catabolization of the xylose via the isomerase pathway, a preferential utilization of glucose over xylose has been already observed several times in different C. glutamicum species (Kawaguchi et al., 2006; Radek et al., 2014). A possible reason for this could be a side activity of the xylose isomerases already discussed in the context of the improved ANT production in cultivations with glucose when the genes for the isomerase pathway were episomally expressed. In the case of the preferential glucose utilization observed in the bioreactors, a competitive competition of glucose and xylose for the binding sites of the xylose isomerases might delay an efficient xylose utilization.\nTaken together, by combining rational strain engineering and biosensor-guided semi-\nrational enzyme engineering approaches, an attractive C. glutamicum strain for ANT production from glucose/xylose mixtures could be constructed. This variant represents a promising starting\npoint for the construction of other production strains for a broader spectrum of aromatic compounds of commercial interest.\nAssociated content Supplementary information Supplementary information accompanies this paper.
