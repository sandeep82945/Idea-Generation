 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Develop new methods for N-O bond cleavage using sustainable catalysts like iron or nickel instead of expensive transition metals like rhodium or palladium. This could make the reactions more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

2. Explore enantioselective versions of the reactions to synthesize chiral N-heterocycles. Only a couple examples were demonstrated so far, so more work can be done on asymmetric catalysis. 

3. Apply the methods to synthesize novel N-heterocycles that have not been made before, especially fused ring systems, spirocyclic, and polycyclic structures. Expand the scope of substrates.

4. Investigate the mechanisms in more detail using computational studies and spectroscopic techniques. This could lead to better understanding and optimization of the reactions.

5. Develop one-pot procedures starting from simple precursors like aldehydes or ketones to generate the oximes/hydroxylamines in situ, avoiding isolation of intermediates. Streamline the synthesis.
