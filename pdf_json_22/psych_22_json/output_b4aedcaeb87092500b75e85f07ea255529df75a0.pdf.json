            "text": "Attitude includes a set of beliefs, emotions, and behavioral intentions toward an object, person, or event. In other words, it is a relatively stable tendency toward a person, an object or an event that appears in feelings and behaviors (1). Unlike many studies conducted on the awareness and attitude of different groups of people toward the mental illness stigma in the western countries, few studies have been carried out in these areas of non-western countries (2, 3).\nStigma is specified as a negative stereotypical view associated with dogmatic beliefs and discrimination, which causes job, livelihood, and communication losses for the patients and those around them (4, 5). Stigma keeps the patients from social position and human reverence. These negative attitudes can be located in many countries (6\u20139). For example, in Nigeria, people have many mis-conceptions about mental patients; they are considered dangerous, unpredictable, rebellious, and unhelpful people. Other studies also underline these findings (1).\nUnfortunately, mental patients receive this stigma from different sources, such as the community, family members, traditional and religious believers, and even mental health caregivers (10, 11). Negative opinions about mental illnesses can be observed throughout a community; and it seems that they come from culture and are fortified and continued by folklore and the media (12, 13). Prejudices related to mental health and those suffering from mental illness often are associated with unrealistic expectations. These unrealistic expectations provide conditions for the patients so that they internalize the stigma and, in turn, becomesa factor to stigmatize themselves; this state is known as self-stigmatization (14).\nPrevious studies have shown all aspects of psychiatry in Iran are affected by stigma; and in our society most mental health patients and their families suffer from stigma. Stigma in our society is a factor that prevents people withmental disorders from seeking treatment (2). Because of the culture of perfectionism in Iran that leads to stigma, there is secrecy in revealing statistics. The tendency of some authorities to hide mental illness and hide statistics is the result of cultural characteristics. In the current study, many participants mentioned cultural weaknesses as obstacles to reducing stigma. Moreover, media as a cultural representation of society does not have sufficient knowledge about mental health, which creates a negative image of mental health. Another qualitative study in Iran showed that about one third of families tried to hide their disorder from others (15, 16).\nDifferent studies have illustrated that clergy are traditionally a haven for some people against the mental sufferings (17, 18). A\nstudy onMuslim Americans highlighted the role and importance of clergy in this regard (18). It is shown in another study that providing social services for depression treatment would be more effective and successful in the presence of church clergy (19). For drug-dependent in America, church is one of the most important sources of visiting and asking help from families and patients (20).\nNumerous studies in the military have affirmed the role and influence of clergy in reducing mental illness stigma, reducing the sense of shame and guilt, and encouraging patients to meet with mental health practitioners (21\u201323). However, several studies have reported some problems, including clergy\u2019s lack of awareness of professional referral centers (18), linking non-related illness factors such as weakness in personality or undesirable topics for illness or the aggravation of mental illness stigma. Despite the negative attitudes in some clergy, who sometimes do not tend to refer the patients (23), recent studies have highlighted the role and importance of the presence of clergy in improving mental health in patients at different levels of prevention and treatment (24).\nMoreover, many clergies are interested to take part in the promotion of mental health. In a study in which 65 clergy participated, 81% of them claimed that they required more training on depression and were willing to get more information from referral centers. The results indicated that the presence of clergy has a remarkable role in the reduction of mental illness stigma. In addition, their presence leads to early visits of patients (25), so holding joint seminars with psychiatrists, clergy, and church monks have been planned. Creating a fund to support for mental patients and helping to create housing for schizophrenic patients were among the advances of this initiation in Poland (26).\nIn an extensive qualitative study performed in Iran, lack of awareness has been proposed as one of the most important barriers to mental health promotion from beneficiaries (27). Numeral solutions have been suggested to tackle this problem named as increasing the awareness of influential groups on society such doctors and clergy (2).\nFrom the perspective of Islam and teachings of the Prophet Mohammad, mental illnesses are divine providence and are separated from sin (18, 27) or divine torment, so this view about mental patients should be divulged among people by spiritual leaders and clergy as this is very effective in decreasing the stigma of mental illnesses in the society. Therefore, the present study was designed with the purpose of reviewing the clergy\u2019s viewpoint toward mental health and the stigma due to mental illnesses and also the effect of organizing workshops on changing their awareness and attitude in this area.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 864806"

To check the validity of the questionnaire, 10 faculty members and psychiatrists were selected; and they confirmed the questionnaire\u2019s validity after some modifications. Also, Cronbach\u2019s alpha calculation was used to define the reliability of the questionnaire and the total alpha coefficient for the questionnaire was calculated as 0.88.\nAt the beginning of the 1st day, the questionnaires were distributed among the clergy and the intended workshops were held after completing these questionnaires. At the end of the 2nd day, the questionnaires were returned back to the clergy to fill out them again.\nThe questionnaire included 15 questions, 11 related to awareness, and 4 to the attitude of clergy toward mental illness stigma, which were scored with the 5-point Likert scale. In the awareness domain, the minimum gained score was 0 and the maximum score was 33. Also, in attitude domain, the first gained score was 0 and the latter was 12. If higher scores were achieved, the awareness and attitudes of clergy would improve.\nThe workshop trainers were three faculty member psychiatrists and one psychologist, each having an experience of 15\u201325 years of mental health training on their resume, with two of professors collaborating with the Ministry of Health.\nRegarding the workshops\u2019 training program, three other psychiatric professors, who were identified through the Qom Seminary Service Center, were also consulted. This led to minor changes to the workshop during the two consecutive sessions of the final program and after collaboration with the professors.\nThe data collected from the clergy\u2019s responses were analyzed using the SPSS software (ver.16), descriptive and analytical tests. The significance level was considered <0.05 in all tests."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The present study was conducted in Qom City, as the core of Shiite Muslim community in Iran and Eastern Mediterranean Region. In some countries, clergy have a remarkable role in interacting with the community, based on some studies on improving mental health (28). The present study, which was designed to examine the clergy\u2019s viewpoint toward the mental illnesses and the consequent stigma in the most considerable religious base in the country, illustrated that one strategy for reducing mental illness stigma in religious communities can be holding training sessions provided for promoting the clergy\u2019s awareness and attitude of mental health. Previous studies have exhibited a long background of mutual distrust between mental health scholars and religious clergy (22), however, it seems that such viewpoints have changed slightly. A study in America, following a training workshop held by religious clergy for psychiatric assistants, focused on the importance of collaboration with clergy and the important role of religion in enhancing mental health in the community (29). A study performed on older patients in 2005, highlighted the role of clergy in reducing mental illness stigma (30).\nAfter a school shooting in Newtown, CT in America, a study investigated the clergy\u2019s performance in sermons. During the examination of the sermons, it was considered that clergy\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 864806\nemphasized the importance of social and emotional support and funding the mental patient costs (31). It was determined in another study that working services for depression treatment would be more prosperous and forceful in the presence of a church clergy (19).\nWhat makes this collaboration more effective and productive is to achieve a common language and more of a mutual understanding from mental health scholars after training, along with the acceptance of more scientific awareness by religion professionals. Research has portrayed that many clergy, despite their desire to help mental health professionals, had not achieved an agreeable outcome due to their lack of scientific background (18, 24, 32).\nSome clergy lack acquired awareness or do not have willingness in referring patients to professional centers (23). But if clergy consider themselves as part of a mental health team member with doctors, nurses, and members of the treatment team, this confidence and participation may be increased (28). In many cases, the first referral of people suffering from mental disorders was to Christian (17) and Muslim (18) clergy.\nStigma can lead to poor attention by decision makers and stakeholders regarding mentally ill individuals (33). Previous studies have shown that fear and distrust from people suffering from mental disorders in society would be lessened with a better understanding of mental disorders among the general public (21). Our findings can promote the affairs of health policy makers in providing mental health education programs and community mental health services exploiting religious clergy and preachers.\nLimitation of this current research include that clergy\u2019s skills, mental health education, and practice of clergy was not evaluated. Therefore, future studies should evaluate effectiveness of this course for the community and mentally ill individuals."
