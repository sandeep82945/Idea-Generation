    "abstractText": "Materials and methods. A total of 200 type 2 diabetes patients who received insulin therapy with an insulin pen were recruited at the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (Chongqing, China). Patients were randomly assigned to a control (n = 100) or intervention (n = 100) group. Conventional health education was conducted in the control group, while a nursing project and conventional health education were undertaken in the intervention group. The following parameters were analyzed between the 2 groups: standardized insulin pen use at admission and discharge, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), time in range (TIR), and adipose hyperplasia incidence rate 6 months after discharge.",

The aim of the study was to explore the effectiveness of a nursing project in improving the insulin self-injection accuracy of diabetes mellitus patients.\nMaterials and methods. A total of 200 type 2 diabetes patients who received insulin therapy with an insulin pen were recruited at the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (Chongqing, China). Patients were randomly assigned to a control (n = 100) or intervention (n = 100) group. Conventional health education was conducted in the control group, while a nursing project and conventional health education were undertaken in the intervention group. The following parameters were analyzed between the 2 groups: standardized insulin pen use at admission and discharge, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), time in range (TIR), and adipose hyperplasia incidence rate 6 months after discharge.\nResults. Concerning standardized insulin self-injection, the intervention group was superior to the control group, and the difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The HbA1c levels (p = 0.000), TIR (p = 0.005) and adipose hyperplasia incidence rate 6 months after discharge (p = 0.000) all improved in the intervention group compared to the control group.\nConclusions. The application of the nursing project effectively improved the efficacy of glucose control in diabetes mellitus patients.\nKey words: diabetes mellitus, insulin injection, nursing project, blood glucose management"

Furthermore, the\u00a0global population of\u00a0diabetes mellitus patients is\u00a0estimated to\u00a0increase to\u00a0643\u00a0million (11.3%) and 783\u00a0million (12.2%) by\u00a02030 and 2045, respectively.\nAccording to\u00a0domestic and foreign guidelines, novel hypoglycemic drugs have been most frequently recommended in\u00a0recent years. However, insulin is\u00a0still critical for diabetes mellitus management5\u20138 and is\u00a0the\u00a0primary drug used for the\u00a0lifelong treatment of\u00a0type\u00a01 diabetes patients and some type\u00a02 diabetes patients.9\u201312 The\u00a0drug is\u00a0widely applied in\u00a0anti-diabetic treatment, but its glucose control effect is\u00a0unsatisfactory. Studies have shown that the\u00a0insulin utilization rate by\u00a0diabetes patients is\u00a050%, but the\u00a0standard rate of\u00a0blood glucose reduction is\u00a0<35%.13\nThe\u00a0 efficacy of\u00a0 insulin injection therapy is\u00a0 affected by\u00a0the\u00a0dosage form, the\u00a0 injection device and the\u00a0technique used.14,15 When treating hypoglycemic patients using an\u00a0insulin pen, most clinicians focus on\u00a0dose adjustment and ignore the\u00a0standardization and improvement of\u00a0injection techniques.16 Although standardized treatment with an\u00a0insulin pen plays a\u00a0critical role in\u00a0treatment,17 improper injection directly affects glucose control and poses an\u00a0enormous risk to\u00a0clinical treatment and patient self-management. As\u00a0 revealed by\u00a0 surveys, many problems occur during insulin treatment, such as\u00a0inadequate disinfection, using the\u00a0wrong injection mode, repeated injections at\u00a0the\u00a0same site, improper model of pen selection, repeated use of\u00a0needles, improper drug loading and unloading, errors in\u00a0injection time, and inappropriate drug storage. These issues can lead to\u00a0large fluctuations in\u00a0blood glucose and increase hypoglycemic risk, local skin infection, subcutaneous adipose hyperplasia, and other skin complications.17,18\u201322 Furthermore, they gravely influence the\u00a0effective management of\u00a0blood glucose and place a\u00a0substantial economic burden on\u00a0patients and society.22,23\nA nursing project is\u00a0a\u00a0scientific approach used to\u00a0improve nursing quality, defined as\u00a0organizationally analyzing specific issues in\u00a0nursing work with limited resources and timing, elucidating their root causes, proposing systematic solutions, and achieving specific goals to\u00a0improve nursing quality and benefit patients. The\u00a0project procedure follows a\u00a0sequence of\u00a0subject determination, status survey, goal setting, cause analysis, countermeasure development, countermeasure implementation, and effectiveness evaluation.\nIn\u00a0 this study, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and time in\u00a0range (TIR) were used to\u00a0evaluate the\u00a0effectiveness of\u00a0the\u00a0nursing project. The\u00a0HbA1c is\u00a0the\u00a0gold standard for the\u00a0clinical evaluation of\u00a0blood glucose control and reflects the\u00a0blood glucose level 2\u20133\u00a0months before enrollment, though it\u00a0does not detect hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic\nevents.24,25 In\u00a0recent years, this drawback has been offset by\u00a0the\u00a0emergence and development of\u00a0continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) techniques that make the\u00a0general blood glucose profile available.26,27 Time in\u00a0range is\u00a0a\u00a0new concept for improving glucose fluctuation monitoring described in\u00a0the\u00a0Chinese Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of\u00a0Type\u00a02 Diabetes (2020 edition),5 and is\u00a0the\u00a0core indicator of\u00a0the\u00a0CGM technique. The\u00a0application of\u00a0TIR is\u00a0a\u00a0novel study design in\u00a0the\u00a0nursing field."

The\u00a0 median scores of\u00a0 insulin installation at\u00a0discharge were significantly higher (U\u00a0=\u00a012.12, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group (median/ IQR: 10.0/2.0, 95% CI: 1.04\u20132.96) compared to\u00a0the\u00a0control group (median/IQR: 4.0/1.0, 95% CI: 0.25\u20131.75). Similarly, median scores of\u00a0pre-injection exhaustion were significantly higher (U\u00a0=\u00a012.09, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group (median/IQR: 10.0/0.0, 95% CI: \u22121.65\u20131.65) than in\u00a0the\u00a0control group (median/IQR: 2.0/5.0, 95% CI: 4.22\u2013 5.78). The\u00a0median score for standardized needle use at\u00a0discharge was also higher in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group (median/ IQR: 10.0/1.0, 95% CI: \u22120.87\u20132.87) compared to\u00a0the\u00a0control group (median/IQR: 4.0/0.0, 95% CI: \u22121.84\u20131.84).\nScores of injection time at\u00a0discharge revealed a\u00a0significant increase (U\u00a0=\u00a010.59, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group (median/IQR: 10.0/0.0, 95% CI: \u22120.51\u20130.51) compared to\u00a0the\u00a0control group (median/IQR: 5.0/0.0, 95% CI: 0.00\u20130.00). Meanwhile, median scores of\u00a0premixed insulin vial-shaking were lower at\u00a0discharge in\u00a0the\u00a0control group (median/IQR: 5.0/5.0, 95% CI: 0.63\u20139.37) than in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group (median/IQR: 10.0/0.0, 95% CI: 0.00\u20130.00).\nTable 3 outlines changes between the\u00a02 groups in\u00a0HbA1c levels on\u00a0admission and after discharge and TIR at\u00a0discharge. After 6\u00a0months of\u00a0the\u00a0nursing project intervention, a\u00a0statistically significant decrease in\u00a0the\u00a0HbA1c level (U\u00a0=\u00a02.97, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) was observed in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group (median/\nIQR: 7.0/2.1, 95% CI: 1.47\u20132.70) in\u00a0comparison to\u00a0the\u00a0control group (median/IQR: 7.7/2.5, 95% CI: 2.10\u20133.24). Similarly, a\u00a0significant increase was observed in\u00a0TIR after discharge (U\u00a0=\u00a02.72, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group (median/IQR: 69.5/30.0, 95% CI: 24.42\u201335.58) compared to\u00a0the\u00a0control group (median/IQR: 59.5/32.0, 95% CI: 23.39\u201340.61).\nThe\u00a0\u03c72 analysis demonstrated a\u00a0statistically significant difference in\u00a0adipose hyperplasia incidence rate after insulin application between the\u00a02 groups (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a026.4, p\u00a0=\u00a00.048). Improvements in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group compared to\u00a0the\u00a0control group were as\u00a0follows: 13.0% for mild, 6.0% for moderate and 2% for severe adipose hyperplasia. The\u00a0nursing project effectively improved the\u00a0therapeutic efficacy of\u00a0insulin injections in\u00a0diabetes mellitus patients (Table 4)."

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus patients who require insulin injection have a\u00a0low standard-reaching rate for glucose control, with non-drug factors being a\u00a0major concern.16 In\u00a0this study, we\u00a0explored the\u00a0effectiveness of\u00a0a\u00a0nursing project for improving patient insulin self-injection. The\u00a0main difference between the\u00a02 groups was that the\u00a0intervention group underwent 6\u00a0health education courses implementing the\u00a0latest course design of\u00a0comprehensive and intensive lectures. Most diabetes mellitus patients are elderly with poor memory and have great difficulty rapidly accepting and storing knowledge, so such a\u00a0course design is\u00a0helpful for them. The\u00a0improvements in\u00a0insulin pen injections (installation) were significantly superior in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group compared to\u00a0the\u00a0control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Thus, the\u00a0nursing project successfully standardized the\u00a0injection technique in\u00a0a\u00a0short period of\u00a0time and is\u00a0therefore worthy of\u00a0implementation.\nThe\u00a0HbA1c and time in\u00a0range, the\u00a0latest study method used in\u00a0the\u00a0nursing field and an\u00a0important indicator for the\u00a0clinical evaluation of\u00a0the\u00a0efficacy of\u00a0glucose control, were used as\u00a0primary and secondary endpoints, respectively, to\u00a0evaluate the\u00a0effectiveness of\u00a0the\u00a0nursing project in\u00a0this study. We\u00a0found a\u00a0statistically significant difference in\u00a0TIR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and HbA1c (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) between the\u00a02 groups at\u00a06\u00a0months, indicating an\u00a0obvious improvement in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group. Time in\u00a0range reached 65% of\u00a0the\u00a0expected target in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group, and it\u00a0reached the\u00a0recommended level (70%) after long-term intervention.31 These findings are similar to\u00a0the\u00a0results of\u00a0a\u00a0previous study.16\nComprehensive non-drug interventions work more slowly than drug interventions. However, most hypoglycemic drugs have serious side effects and may be used as\u00a0 adjuvant therapy to\u00a0 reduce the\u00a0 daily insulin dose, as\u00a0shown in\u00a0a\u00a0previous study.16 Standardized insulin pen use effectively reduced variations in\u00a0insulin absorption32,33 and stably controlled blood glucose so that it\u00a0approached or\u00a0 reached the\u00a0 target level, confirming the\u00a0 efficacy of\u00a0the\u00a0nursing project and improving patient satisfaction with treatment. In\u00a0this study, we\u00a0explored the\u00a0relationship between TIR and standardized insulin injection but did not elucidate influential factors and their effects, which will be the\u00a0direction of\u00a0subsequent nursing research.\nSimilar to\u00a0a\u00a0previous study,22 patients using premixed insulin were selected at\u00a0enrollment since a\u00a0lack of\u00a0standardized vial-shaking of\u00a0 premixed insulin may lead to\u00a0an\u00a0 increased proportion of\u00a0short-acting insulin and thus increase the\u00a0risk of\u00a0hypoglycemia, affecting the\u00a0glucose control effect.5 In\u00a0our study, patients were unfamiliar with the\u00a0vial-shaking skills required for premixing insulin, though the\u00a0nursing project achieved a\u00a0limited improvement by\u00a0reinforcement. This observation is\u00a0largely related to\u00a0patients not giving sufficient importance to\u00a0a\u00a0standardized injection technique, a\u00a0 lack of\u00a0 formal pre-hospital training, and a\u00a0 lack of\u00a0references to\u00a0guidelines, as\u00a0well as\u00a0the\u00a0intervention time of\u00a0the\u00a0nursing project. A\u00a07-day nursing intervention during hospitalization failed to\u00a0induce a\u00a0successful switch from a\u00a0conventional injection technique to\u00a0a\u00a0post-intervention standardized injection technique in\u00a0patients, highlighting that the\u00a0intervention time of\u00a0the\u00a0nursing project needs to\u00a0be prolonged.\nIn\u00a0contrast to\u00a0previous investigations,14,19 this study demonstrated that the\u00a0injection time was associated with pre-injection hunger in\u00a0patients. Newly admitted patients showed excessive hunger due to\u00a0medical examination requirements. Patients often self-injected insulin and then ate several snacks before the\u00a0provision of\u00a0staple foods. Some patients, especially those requiring 3 injections, missed regular meals because of\u00a0the\u00a0demand for a\u00a0medical examination. As\u00a0a\u00a0result, insulin injections could not be determined as\u00a0being pre-breakfast or\u00a0pre-lunch. For the\u00a0fasting examination, some patients underwent a\u00a0fasting state of\u00a010\u00a0h or\u00a0longer due to\u00a0a\u00a0long waiting period for\nvarious reasons and probably presented with hypoglycemic symptoms. The\u00a0evaluation and intervention of\u00a0these patients are critical and will be investigated by\u00a0a\u00a0subgroup study in\u00a0our subsequent nursing project plan.\nAdipose hyperplasia is\u00a0an\u00a0insulin injection-related complication that manifests as\u00a0skin swelling or\u00a0subcutaneous induration, but its pathogenesis is\u00a0unknown. It\u00a0is\u00a0perhaps associated with the\u00a0overall time of\u00a0insulin treatment, a\u00a0lack of\u00a0change in\u00a0the\u00a0injection site and repeated needle use.34 The\u00a0overall time for insulin treatment is\u00a0uncontrollable and is\u00a0a\u00a0blind spot in\u00a0our study, thus it\u00a0will be the\u00a0subject of\u00a0future research. The\u00a0lack of\u00a0change in\u00a0the\u00a0injection site and repeated needle use can be improved by\u00a0the\u00a0nursing project to\u00a0decrease the\u00a0adipose hyperplasia incidence rate and reduce insulin dose and treatment costs.16,19 In\u00a0the\u00a0present study, 4 conventional injection sites (abdomen, upper arm, thigh, and buttocks) were selected, and a\u00a032G 4-mm insulin pen needle was used in\u00a0all enrolled patients. Buttock injections were difficult for patients, and they required assistance from their families or\u00a0doctors/nurses to\u00a0change injection sites in\u00a0order to\u00a0reduce the\u00a0occurrence of\u00a0adipose hyperplasia. Studies have suggested that the\u00a0skin thickness of\u00a0the\u00a0Asian population is\u00a01.7\u20132.8\u00a0mm on\u00a0average.35,36 A\u00a04-mm needle is\u00a0sufficiently long to\u00a0penetrate the\u00a0skin by\u00a0vertical insertion and short enough to\u00a0effectively reduce the\u00a0risk of\u00a0injection into the\u00a0muscle layer37 while reducing and preventing the\u00a0occurrence of\u00a0hypoglycemia. Previous studies have demonstrated the\u00a0safety of\u00a0the\u00a04-mm needle in\u00a0all populations.16 Therefore, other needle models were excluded at\u00a0patient enrollment.\nFrom a\u00a0technical perspective, conventional health education and a\u00a0nursing project alongside conventional health education were conducted in\u00a0the\u00a0control and intervention groups, respectively. As\u00a0shown by\u00a0the\u00a0study results, the\u00a0 incidence rate of\u00a0adipose hyperplasia 6\u00a0months after discharge was lower in\u00a0the\u00a0intervention group than in\u00a0the\u00a0control group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048), highlighting the\u00a0efficacy of\u00a0the\u00a0nursing project. However, such improvement was insignificant due to\u00a0the\u00a0short intervention time of\u00a0only 6\u00a0months. The\u00a0occurrence of\u00a0adipose hyperplasia is\u00a0a\u00a0long process; thus, good comparability requires standardized insulin injections over the\u00a0long term."
