    "abstractText": "Defect characterizes the depth of factorization of terms in differential (cyclotomic) expansions of knot polynomials, i.e. of the non-perturbative Wilson averages in the Chern-Simons theory. We prove the conjecture that the defect can be alternatively described as the degree in q\u00b12 of the fundamental Alexander polynomial, which formally corresponds to the case of no colors. We also pose a question if these Alexander polynomials can be arbitrary integer polynomials of a given degree. A first attempt to answer the latter question is a preliminary analysis of antiparallel descendants of the 2-strand torus knots, which provide a nice set of examples for all values of the defect. The answer turns out to be positive in the case of defect zero knots, what can be observed already in the case of twist knots. This proved conjecture also allows us to provide a complete set of C-polynomials for the symmetrically colored Alexander polynomials for defect zero. In this case, we achieve a complete separation of representation and knot variables.",

            "text": "The HOMFLY-PT polynomials [1\u201310] are the main nonperturbative observables in the Chern-Simons theory [11, 12], and at the moment they are the most important source of information about such quantities \u2013 much worse understood than correlators in matrix models [13,14] and intimately related supersymmetric (AGT-controlled) low-energy theories [15,16]. Being originally defined as certain contractions of quantum R-matrices [17\u201327], the HOMFLY polynomials possess a lot of additional structures, which are not immediately obvious from the Chern-Simons formulation and are instead the implications of generic representation\na e-mail: lanina.en@phystech.edu (corresponding author) b e-mail: morozov@itep.ru\ntheory. They range from the very polynomiality of Wilson loop averages in appropriate variables q = exp (\n2\u03c0 i g+N\n) and\nA = qN , to description in terms of Khovanov-Rozansky complexes [28\u201333]. Of special interest in this list is the differential expansion and its properties.\nThe differential expansion (DE) for the reduced HOMFLY polynomial in symmetric representations for the figure-eight knot 41 was introduced in [34] and was further generalized to other knots [35\u201341]. Originally it was suggested in the form\nHK[r ] ?= r\u2211 j=0 [r ]! [ j]![r \u2212 j]! F K[ j](A, q) j\u22121\u220f i=0 {Aqr+i }{Aqi\u22121}\n(1.1)\nwith Laurent polynomials FK[ j](A, q). Here, as usual, {x} := x \u2212 x\u22121 and [n] := {qn}/{q}. The DE is also known under the name of cyclotomic expansion [38,42\u201347]. The question mark in (1.1) stands because the relation is not quite true for all knots K, in generic case it is actually weaker [48]:\nHK[r ] = r\u2211 j=0 [r ]!

The defect [48] characterizes the degree of its enhancement towards FK[ j].\nThe variables GK[ j] can provide better coordinates in the space of knots than the HOMFLY polynomials themselves [49], still they are far from being free parameters. In particular, they satisfy the C-polynomial equations [41,50,51], which are still far from being well understood and classified.\nIn this paper, we clarify the situation with an alternative description of the defect \u03b4 [48] \u2013 as dictated by the\ndegree \u03b4 + 1 of the fundamental Alexander polynomial in q\u00b12. We explicitly prove that this is indeed a corollary of definition (1.2) and derive explicit expressions for the DE coefficients GK[r ](1, q) at A = 1 in terms of the coefficients of the fundamental Alexander polynomial. This description provides an explicit restriction on GK[r ](1, q) \u2013 they are not free. What still can be free are the fundamental coefficients G[1](1, q) = F[1](1, q)1 at r = 1 \u2013 they could be arbitrary integer symmetric polynomials of degree \u03b4. We show that this is indeed the case for \u03b4 = 0 and provide some ideas on how this problem can be investigated for higher \u03b4. Namely, we use the defect-preserving antiparallel evolution [52] of the 2-strand knots, which provides rich sets of examples for all values of the defect. This also allows us to highlight the properties of the antiparallel evolution and derive non-trivial examples, when the defect drops down at particular points (the conjecture of [52] does not allow it to raise but allows occasional dropdowns).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sects. 2, 3 we remind the definitions of the DE and its defect for the case of symmetric representations. The central Sect. 4 proves that defect \u03b4 is unambiguously related to the degree \u03b4 + 1 of the fundamental Alexander , and in Sect. 4.2.2 we express all the coefficients G[r ](1, q) of DE for the symmetric Alexander polynomials through G[1](1, q). These are our main results.\nThe remaining part of the paper concerns open questions and is not yet conclusive. We discuss the following issues.\n\u2022 First, if all G[r ](1, q) are expressed through G[1](1, q), can the latter one be arbitrary (free)? It is for \u03b4 = 0, but what about the higher defects? To address this question, in Sect. 5 we rewrite the expressions from Sect. 4.2.2 in a more explicit/detailed form, and consider a similarly rich family of antiparallel descendants of the two-strand torus knots. This is an interesting family by itself, but the corresponding sets G[1](1, q) for \u03b4 \u2265 1 look unexpectedly restricted. At the moment, it is unclear if this is a property of this particular set (it is not as big as it seems) or G[1](1, q) are indeed far from being free. \u2022 Second, is the defect indeed as simple as described in Sect. 3, or is there a more sophisticated structure, associated with more complicated degeneracy diagrams? We do not go deep into this problem (raised already in [48] and [52]), we just provide some illustrations of \u201caccidental\u201d degeneracies in Sect. 6. This also helps to reformulate the statement about invariance of the defect under antiparallel evolution more carefully \u2013 defect can actually drop down at some evolution points, and there remains a question, if this should be treated as \u201caccidents\u201d or as a manifestation of additional structures, promoting defect\n1 We sometimes omit the upper index K to shorten expressions.\nfrom just a number to a slightly more involved characteristic of the DE. \u2022 Third, can we express the fact that all G[r ](1, q) are made from G[1](1, q) as some equations for G[r ](1, q)? In Sect. 7, we show that such \u201cAlexanderC-polynomials\u201d can indeed be defined and they are considerably simpler than generic C-polynomials for the HOMFLY polynomial and superpolynomials. \u2022 Fourth, can we lift the description of G[r ](1, q) through G[1](1, q) to non-symmetric representations? In Sect. 8, we make first steps in this direction.\nConclusion in Sect. 9 contains a brief summary."

            "text": "In this paper, we mostly consider the differential expansion of the HOMFLY polynomials in the simplest case of symmetric representations. All the HOMFLY polynomials are reduced, i.e. they are Wilson averages in an irreducible representation R, divided by the dimension of the representation. The differential (cyclotomic) expansion is what follows from elementary representation theory and from the fact that it is respected by the HOMFLY polynomials. Namely, we get use of the properties below.\n\u2022 In slN algebra, [R1, . . . , RN ] = [R1+\u03b4R, . . . , RN+\u03b4R] for any integer \u03b4R . \u2022 In slN algebra, a representation R and its conjugate R\u0304 are equivalent. \u2022 The HOMFLY polynomial possesses the symmetry under the transposition of a diagram [53]:\nHKR\u2228(q, A) = HKR (q\u22121, A) , (2.1)\nwhere R\u2228 denotes the transposition of a Young diagram R.\nThese facts restrict the HOMFLY group structure drastically. We use them to obtain the differential expansion for the symmetric HOMFLY polynomials. To begin with, for N = 1 all representations are trivial and the HOMFLY polynomials are unities. In particular, for R = [r ] we have\nHK[r ](q, A = q) = 1 \u21d2 HK[r ](q, A) \u2212 1 ... {A/q} . (2.2)\nAt the same time, for N = r the antisymmetric representation [1r ] is the same as singlet, \u2205, so\nHK[1r ](q, A = qr ) = 1 \u21d2 HK[1r ](q, A) \u2212 1 ... {A/qr } ,\n(2.3)\nand utilizing the basic transposition property (2.1) and taking into account (2.2), we obtain:\nHK[r ](q, A) \u2212 1 \u223c {Aqr }{A/q} . (2.4) In fact, for r > 1 this is not the full story. We illustrate this by the next simplest example. For N = 3, we have an additional property: HK[1](q, A = q3) = HK[1,1](q, A = q3), because in this case the two representations [1] and [1, 1] are the same. This fact implies that\nH[1,1] \u2212 H[1] \u223c { A/q3 } (2.1)\u21d0\u21d2 H[2]\n\u2212H[1] \u223c { Aq3 } (2.4) \u21d2 H[2] \u2212 H[1] \u223c { Aq3 } {A/q} .\n(2.5)\nFrom (2.4), we get\nHK[1](q, A) = 1 + {Aq}{A/q}FK[1](q, A) . (2.6) with Laurent polynomial F[1](q, A). Then\nHK[2](q, A) = HK[1](q, A) + gK2 (q, A){Aq3}{A/q} = 1 + ( {Aq}FK[1](q, A) + hK2 (q, A){Aq3} ) {A/q} .\n(2.7)\nFrom (2.4), it follows that HK[2](q, A) \u2212 1 \u223c {Aq2}{A/q}, so we set h2 = F[1] + { Aq2 } G[2] with some polynomial G[2](q, A) and obtain H[1] = 1 + F[1] \u00b7 {Aq}{A/q}, H[2] = 1 + [2]F[1] \u00b7 { Aq2 } {A/q} + G[2] \u00b7 { Aq3 } { Aq2\n} {A/q} . (2.8)\nIn the same way, one can iteratively deduce that for an arbitrary knot\nHK[r ] = r\u2211\nk=0\n[r ]!

Also unknown is identification of the defect with more conventional discrete topological numbers, which are associated with knots.\nAs we will see in Sect. 6, the list of diagrams above can be not exhaustive: sometimes some boxes can be eliminated \u2013 there are additional zeroes in coefficients of the DE. Moreover, there can be some regularity \u2013 new zeroes appear at the boundaries of our diagrams, and preserve their ladder structure. This can be a signal that defect is not just a number, but a more complicated structure, perhaps, like a Young diagram, as suggested in original [48]. These additional zeroes also affect precise formulation of antiparallel invariance of the defect3, which is also discussed in Sect. 6.\nIn this paper, we address/prove still another \u2013 and simpler, characterization of the defect: the conjecture [48] that it is equal to the degree of the fundamental Alexander polynomial minus one. This is a relatively simple statement, it concerns only the bottom level of the above diagrams. Indeed, the Alexander polynomial arises at A = 1 and then (3.1) means that there are just a few non-vanishing\nGK(\u03b4)[s] (1, q) = GK (\u03b4) [s] (1, q) , 1 < s \u2264 \u03b4 + 1 (3.6) shown by small black dots in pictures (3.2)\u2013(3.5). Big dots stand for F[1](1, q), which can vanish only occasionally (see Sect. 6 below). For higher s, the product at the r.h.s. of (3.1) contains {A}, which vanishes at A = 1. Despite the fact that the statement seems simple, it becomes highly informative\n3 In [52], it was conjectured that the defect does not change under substitution of any knot crossing with an antiparallel braid, except for a few knots for which the defect occasionally drops down.\nif one assumes that (3.1) is known \u2013 then it allows to predict a lot about the colored HOMFLY polynomial (and, actually, superpolynomials as well) by making a nearly trivial calculation for the fundamental Alexander polynomial."

            "text": "In this section, we prove that the defect (in most cases, see Sect. 6) can be defined as the degree of the fundamental Alexander polynomial minus one.

(4.5)\nThe trick is to look at the r dependence, which at the l.h.s. is just quadratic in q\u00b1r because F[1](1, q) is independent of r . This restricts the q-dependence of F[1](1, qr ) at the r.h.s \u2013 actually to nothing.\nNote that from (4.5), it follows that the degree of the fundamental Alexander polynomial is \u03b4 + 1 = 1. However, sometimes it happens that F[1](1, q) = 0 and the degree of the fundamental Alexander polynomial drops to 0. Examples are provided in Sect. 6.1.\n\u2022 For the defect \u03b4 = 1 it is released, but just a little. For r > 1 there are three terms:\nA[r ] = 1 \u2212 [r ]F[1](1, q){qr }{q} \u2212[r ][r \u2212 1][2] G[2](1, q){q r+1}{qr }{q} , (4.6)\nand therefore\n[r ]{qr }{q}F[1](1, q) + [r ][r \u2212 1][2] G[2](1, q){q r+1}{qr }{q}\n= {qr }2F[1](1, qr ) \u21d2 F[1](1, q) = b \u00b7 (q2 + q\u22122) + a, G[2](1, q) = b \u00b7 {q2} (4.7)\nwith some constants a and b 5. At the l.h.s., we have a quartic polynomial of q\u00b1r , therefore the same must happen to the r.h.s., thus F[1] is at most quadratic. Note that this does not mean, that G[2](1, q) is independent of q \u2013 the dependence exists, but it is fully fixed in terms of the q-dependence of F[1](1, q).\n5 Of course, the q-dependence of entire F[1](A, q) and G[2](A, q) with A = 1 can be far more involved. For example, for the defect-1 knot [7, 5]:\nThe conjecture about the defect still holds: the degree of the Alexander polynomial turns out to be \u03b4 + 1 = 2.\nWe return to defect 0 if b = 0.

Expectedly or not, this expression is rather involved \u2013 it is the usual amusement in knot theory to observe how fast the complicated structures emerge from the trivial inputs.

(4.25) We see that F (1)[1] and g (1) 2 \u223c G(1)[2] are not independent. They are related by the Alexander C-polynomial (see Sect. 7). The obvious question is (see Sect. 5): Are all integer pairs (a(1)1 , a (1) 0 ) allowed for knots? In other words, can one get an arbitrary integer for g(1)2 and an arbitrary integer symmetric Laurent polynomial of degree 1 in q\u00b12 for F (1)[1] ?\u2022 For the defect \u03b4 = 2 F (2)[1] (1, q) = a(2)0 + a(2)1 \u00b7 (q2 + q\u22122) + a(2)2 \u00b7 (q4 + q\u22124)\n(4.26)\nand\ng(2)2 (q) = 1\u2211\nm=0 a(2)m+1\u03bem,m+1 = a(2)1\n\u00b7\u03be0,1 + a(2)2 \u00b7 \u03be1,2 = a(2)1 + a(2)2 \u00b7 [2](q3 + q\u22123) ,\ng(2)3 (q) = 0\u2211\nm=0 a(2)m+2\u03bem,m+2 = a(2)2 \u00b7 \u03be0,2 = a(2)2 . (4.27)\nThis time we can again ask if all integer triples (a(2)2 , a (2) 1 , a (2) 0 ) are allowed (see Sect. 5). From the very beginning we see that g(2)2 (q) has degree 2, not 1 (in q\n\u00b12) but only two parameters a(2)1 , a (2) 2 , so that a generic integer polynomial of degree 2 cannot appear in the role of g(2)2 (q). \u2022 For the defect \u03b4 = 3 F (3)[1] (1, q) = a(3)0 + a(3)1 \u00b7 (q2 + q\u22122)\n+a(3)2 \u00b7 (q4 + q\u22124) + a(3)3 \u00b7 (q6 + q\u22126) (4.28) and\ng(3)2 (q) = 2\u2211\nm=0 a(3)m+1\u03bem,m+1 = a(3)1 + a(3)2 \u00b7 [2](q3 + q\u22123) +a(3)3 \u00b7 [3](q6 + 1 + q\u22126) ,\ng(3)3 (q) = 1\u2211\nm=0 a(3)m+2\u03bem,m+2 = a(3)2 \u00b7 \u03be0,2 + a(3)3 \u00b7 \u03be1,3 = a(3)2 +a(3)3 \u00b7 [3](q4 + q\u22124) ,\ng(3)4 (q) = 0\u2211\nm=0 a(3)m+3\u03bem,m+3 = a(3)3 \u00b7 \u03be0,3 = a(3)3 . (4.29)\nAgain, g(3)2 and g (3) 3 are not arbitrary integer Laurent polynomials. In the next section, we will discuss whether all integer a j can be met in the symmetric Alexander DE.\n4.3 Intermediate summary\nWe have proved that the defect \u03b4 defines the degree of the fundamental Alexander polynomial. Moreover, all the dependence on a knotK for all symmetric Alexander polynomials is concentrated in \u03b4 parameters (numbers) a(\u03b4)j , j = 1, . . . , \u03b4. Note that any given a(\u03b4)j enters only F[1](1, q) and the first few G[i](1, q) with i \u2264 j . This triangularity implies that the degree of F[1] defines the number of non-vanishing G[i]. Only a(\u03b4)\u03b4 appears in all \u03b4 DE coefficients G[i](1, q), which contribute to the Alexander polynomial (note that the other G[i](1, q) with i > \u03b4 + 1 need not vanish, but they do not contribute to the DE at A = 1).\nRelations (4.20), (4.22) are somewhat sophisticated. A useful way to represent them is through recurrence conditions (equations), which are also known as C-polynomials [51] for the Alexander polynomials, see Sect. 7 below. Still, another question to address is if the same parameters a(\u03b4)i are sufficient to describe the reduced Alexander polynomials in all other representations. We remind that the reducedAlexander polynomials are non-vanishing for all representations. The simplifying reduction condition, similar to (4.1), remains\ntrue for all single-hook representations, but it breaks violently for multiple hooks. The last direction will be addressed elsewhere, while one-hook representations will be considered in Sect. 8. In the next section of the present paper we will restrict to a kind of inverse question \u2013 if everything about the Alexander polynomials is fully controlled by a(\u03b4)i , then are they free parameters or somehow constrained as well?"

            "text": "A remarkable property of knot polynomials is that all their coefficients are integer. For the HOMFLY polynomials, this follows technically from the R-matrix formalism. In general, this is the ground for cohomological descriptions in terms of various complexes, like in Khovanov-Rozansky approach [31].\nIn other words, all the coefficients a j in (4.13) are integers and all g j in (4.15) are Laurent polynomials in q with integer coefficients. From (4.20), it is not obvious why g(\u03b4)j are integer Laurent polynomials in q, because of the monstrous coefficients \u03bem,n (4.21). Still, there is a bit simpler formula (4.22). From this expansion, it is clear that g(\u03b4)j are integer Laurent polynomials in q. Indeed, one rewrites \u03c3 j,k in the form\n\u03c3 j,k = k\u2211\ni=0 (\u22121)kqk(k\u22122i+1)\u22122i\n[ j + k i ]\nq\u22122\n[ j + k j + i ]\nq2 ,\n(5.1)\nso that \u03c3 j,k is constructed with quantum binomial coefficients which are integer Laurent polynomials in q.\nNow, there is a question whether one can get any integers as the values of a and any Laurent polynomials g with integer coefficients. In the following subsections we make a first attempt to understand the abundance of values of a(\u03b4)i in the space of knots. We look at the simplest possibility \u2013 at the families of antiparallel descendants of 2-strand torus knots with the hope that they represent big enough sets for each particular defect. The result turns out to be modest if not discouraging \u2013 the values of a(\u03b4)i appearing in these families look rather poor, at least for \u03b4 > 0. Still, the exercise is interesting and it also provides a more accurate formulation for the defect-preservation conjecture of [41] (see Sect. 6), which makes it fully consistent with the defect-degree correspondence studied in the present paper.\nWe would like to mention a related result in [54], which states that the scalar equation satisfied by colored Alexander polynomials implies certain integrality property of Labastida-Marino-Ooguri-Vafa conjecture. It is interesting to search possible connections with our studies.\n5.1 2-strand torus knots\nThe (2m+1)1 torus knot (a closure of 2 strands with 2m+1 crossings) has maximal possible (for given number of intersections) defect \u03b4 = m \u2212 1 and a(m\u22121)i = \u2212floor ( m + 1 \u2212 i\n2\n) , i = 0, . . . ,m \u2212 1 . (5.2)\nFor example, for 91 parameter m = 4 and a(3)0 = \u2212floor(5/2) = \u22122, a(3)1 = \u2212floor(4/2) = \u22122, a(3)2 = \u2212floor(3/2) = \u22121, a(3)3 = \u2212floor(2/2) = \u22121 .\nSubstituting (5.2) into (4.13) and (4.20), we get\nF (2m+1)1[1] (1, q) (4.13)= a(m\u22121)0\n+ m\u22121\u2211 i=1 a(m\u22121)i (q 2i + q\u22122i ) (5.2)= \u2212[m + 1][m][2] ,\nG (2m+1)1[2] (1, q) = \u2212 [m + 2]! [3][4][m \u2212 2]! {q} , G (2m+1)1[3] (1, q) = \u2212 [m + 3]! [4][5][6][m \u2212 3]! {q} 2 , . . . G (2m+1)1[i] (1, q) = \u2212 [m + i]![i]! [m \u2212 i]]![2i]! {q} i\u22121 , G (2m+1)1[m\u2212 j] (1, q) = \u2212 [2m \u2212 j]![m \u2212 j]! [ j]![2m \u2212 2 j]! {q}\nm\u2212 j\u22121 , . . . G (2m+1)1[m\u22121] (1, q) (4.20)= ( a(m\u22121)m\u22122 + a(m\u22121)m\u22121 \u00b7 [m \u2212 1](qm + q\u2212m ) )\nm\u22121\u220f i=2 {qi } (5.2)= \u2212[2m \u2212 1][m \u2212 1]!{q}m\u22122 ,\nG (2m+1)1[m] (1, q) (4.20)= a(m\u22121)m\u22121 \u00b7 m\u220f i=2 {qi }\n(5.2)= m\u220f i=2 {qi } = [m]!{q}m\u22121 . (5.3)\nAll these DE coefficients are nicely factorized.\n5.2 Antiparallel descendants of torus knots\nThe set (5.2) provides just one point per defect in m = \u03b4+1dimensional space of parameters am\u22121i . However, this may be not a big problem: we can now use the defect-preserving antiparallel evolution [52] in each intersection, which gives rise to a 2m + 1-dimensional family of antiparallel pretzels with the same defect \u03b4 = m\u22121. This dimension is more than enough, the question is only if arbitrary integer vectors am\u22121i appear in this family. Regarding G[k], as we have first seen in Sect. 4.2.3, they are not generic integer symmetric Laurent polynomials of a given degree \u2013 the degree is typically higher than the number of contributing parameters a(\u03b4)i .\nAccording to [25], the HOMFLY polynomial for the odd antiparallel pretzel of genus 2m is equal to\nH(n1,...,n2m+1)[r ] = r+1\u2211 j=1 d2m[r ] dm\u22121/2j 2m+1\u220f a=1 ( S\u0304T\u0304 2na\u22121S ) 1, j . (5.4)\nWe restrict it to a symmetric representation R = [r ] and refer to Sect. 3 of [41] for detailed notation in this case. We also do not put bars over na , what is usually done to distinguish antiparallel evolution, since this is the only one which is matter for the formulas. To further simplify them, we write na in the labels and in the denotations of pretzel knots instead of 2na \u2212 1.\nFor fundamental representation, we obtain:\nH(n1,...,n2m+1)[1] = {Aq\u22121} {q2} 2m+1\u220f a=1 A2na\u22122q\u22121 \u2212 q A2na + q \u2212 q\u22121 {A}\n+{Aq}{q2} 2m+1\u220f a=1 \u2212q A2na\u22122 + A2na q\u22121 + q \u2212 q\u22121 {A} . (5.5)\nTaking limit A \u2192 1, we get that the degree of q\u00b12 in F[1] is equal to m, and the corresponding coefficients of F[1] are given by formulas (5.8), (5.10) and (5.13)\u2013(5.22).\nStrictly speaking, the defect is not fully preserved by antiparallel evolution. For example, the trefoil 31 is not only the parent-knot in defect-zero family, but also a descendant of all other knots: 31 = (1, 1, 1) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 0) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0) = . . . As we will see (Sect. 6), there are also other defect-zero points in higher-defect evolution families. What is important for this paper, these dropdowns are easily captured by the fundamental Alexander \u2013 its power also drops.\n5.3 Defect \u03b4 = m \u2212 1 = 0: descendants of 31\nIn this case there is just a single coefficient a(0)0 and all g (0) j = 0. Thus, the question is just if all integer a(0)0 are possible. The answer is positive, and an example is provided just by the family of twist knots [55], which form a class of descendants of 31: a(0)0 ( twistn\n) = F twistn[1] (q, A = 1) = n . (5.6) In particular,\n. . . F72[1](q, A = 1) = \u22123 , F52[1](q, A = 1) = \u22122 , F31[1](q, A = 1) = \u22121 , Funknot[1] (q, A = 1) = 0 , F41[1](q, A = 1) = 1 ,\nF61[1](q, A = 1) = 2 , F81[1](q, A = 1) = 3 . . . . (5.7)\nMore examples are given by the larger families of double braids [35] and 3-pretzels [41], also obtained by the defectpreserving antiparallel evolution from the trefoil 31 [52] and thus all having the defect zero:\na(0)0 ( pretzel2l\u22121,2m\u22121,2n\u22121 ) = lmn \u2212 (l \u2212 1)(m \u2212 1)(n \u2212 1) . (5.8)\nThey provide more delicate information about the abundancy/frequency of particular values of a(0)0 in the population of knots \u2013 which is a question at the next level of complexity.\n5.4 Defect \u03b4 = m \u2212 1 = 1: descendants of 51\nUsing (5.5) for defect \u03b4 = m \u2212 1 = 1 (descendants of 51) and the notation\nF (n1,...,n5)[1] (1, q) = a(n1,...,n5)0 + a(n1,...,n5)1 (q2 + q\u22122) , (5.9)\nwe get a(n1,...,n5)0 = 2 \u2211\n1\u2264a<b<c<d\u22645 nanbncnd\n\u22122 \u2211\n1\u2264a<b<c\u22645 nanbnc + \u2211 1\u2264a<b\u22645 nanb \u2212 1 ,\na(n1,...,n5)1 = \u2212 \u2211\n1\u2264a<b<c<d\u22645 nanbncnd + \u2211 1\u2264a<b<c\u22645 nanbnc\n\u2212 \u2211\n1\u2264a<b\u22645 nanb + \u2211 1\u2264a\u22645 na \u2212 1 . (5.10)\nIn particular,\na(n1,2,1,1,1)0 = n1 \u2212 2, a(n1,2,1,1,1)1 = \u22122n1 , (5.11) what provides us with a full-fledged 1-dimensional subspace in the 2-dimensional space of integer (a0, a1).\nFor our analysis of the Alexander polynomial for this family, Eq. (5.10) could be practical. Still, it is rather difficult to extract conclusive statements. Our preliminary impression is that the 2-dimensional set of (a0, a1) for descendants of 51 is severely restricted and does not cover the full integer lattice.

Expressions (5.14) restrict integer sets {a0, . . . , a\u03b4}, so that for \u03b4 > 0 they are not arbitrary, at least for the family of antiparallel descendants of torus knots. In the next subsection we will provide a kind of probable explanation for sets of a j to be so restricted.\n5.6 Example of 91\nTo emphasize the peculiarity of torus knots, we add an example of\ndefect 3 : knot 91 a(3)0 = \u22122, a(3)1 = \u22122, a(3)2 = \u22121, a(3)3 = \u22121 . (5.23)\nThe point is that all the four non-vanishing combinations are nicely factorized expressions (5.3):\nF91[1](1, q) = \u2212 [4][5] [2] ,\nG91[2](1, q) = \u2212{q}[5][6] , G91[3](1, q) = \u2212{q}2[2][3][7] , G91[4](1, q) = \u2212{q}3[2][3][4] . (5.24) In this case, this factorization is a result of fine tuning of the coefficientsa(3)i , which are very special. It can happen that the antiparallel descendants continue to carry some weakened traces of this peculiarities and this is the reason why they do not describe the general situation with a given defect. In any case, the question, if the coefficients a(\u03b4)i are all independent or not, remains open."

            "text": "In this section, we discuss the defect drop downs and additional peculiarities to the standard defect-diagrams (3.2)- (3.5). The analysis is simpler to conduct by the use of the connection with the degree of the fundamental Alexander\npolynomial. Namely, the mentioned deviations occur if several highest coefficients a(\u03b4)j (4.13) vanish. In this case, there are two options:\n1. The defect drops down. 2. The defect stays the same, but F[1] and some of G[s] turn\nout to additionally factorize.\nBelow, we will consider concrete examples and discuss these properties in more detail. It turns out that some mentioned peculiarities and drop downs can be classified, so that such ones are not occasional.\n6.1 Descendants of 31\nIn this case, just a 1Z -parametric family of twist knots within the 3Z -dimensional set of trefoil descendants is sufficient to provide any value of a0 (see Sect. 5.3). Still, triple pretzels provide additional curious examples. As already mentioned in [52], there are knots with the unit Alexander polynomial, a0 = 0, in this family, which are not unknots, for example6\nF (\u22121,3,4)[1] (A, q) = {A}A3(A2 + 1)(A4 + A2 + 1) (6.1)\nand vanishes at A = 17. Actually, this knot is a point of a whole family (\u2212k, 2k+1, 2k+2). Moreover, there are many other evolution points, where the Alexander polynomial turn to 1. Formally, we could associate to these cases a new sort\n6 Recall that for pretzel knots (2n1 \u2212 1, . . . , 2n2m+1 \u2212 1), we denote F- and G-factors superscripts as (n1, . . . , n2m+1). 7 Actually, for triple pretzels, all the knots have F[1](A, q) independent of q for arbitrary A \u2013 not only their Alexander limit F[1](1, q) at A = 1. However, this is not a general property of the defect-zero knots \u2013 already in the next Sect. 5.4 we will mention the members of 51 family, where F[1](A, q) are linear in q\u00b12, as all the members of that family. Still, the defect is \u03b4 = 0, because this q-dependence disappears at A = 1. Just a couple of non-trivial examples is provided by\n\u03b4(3,2,\u22121,\u22124,\u22125) = 0 and F (3,2,\u22121,\u22124,\u22125)[1] = 2 + {A} ( U0(A) +U1(A)(q2 + q\u22122) ) , \u03b4(3,2,\u22121,\u22123,\u22128) = 0 and F (3,2,\u22121,\u22123,\u22128)[1] = 2 + {A} ( V0(A) + V1(A)(q2 + q\u22122) ) (6.2)\nwith somewhat complicated polynomials U and V . Then, there are defect-0 knots among the antiparallel descendants of 71, with F[1] depending on the squares of q\u00b12 at A = 1 and so on.\nof a diagram:\nsometimes for\ndefect \u03b4K = 0:\ns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n(6.3)\nIn this way, one can actually reveal a more sophisticated structure in the defect (like a Young diagram, not just a single number).\n6.2 Descendants of 51\nWith the help of (5.10), one immediately observes numerous zeroes of a1 within the 5-fold antiparallel family \u2013 does this signal about a deviation from the defect-preservation theorem? Not quite, this rather calls for a more accurate formulation. Antiparallel evolution can, of course, convert 51 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) into 31 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 0) and likewise the other knots from the defect-one family into those from defectzero. Thus, the defect-preservation means that the defect is not increased, but it can drop down at particular values of evolution parameters. This never happens when they all have the same signs, otherwise one should be carefull with this kind of the defect drop-downs.\nMore interesting are the cases like (3, 2,\u22121,\u22124,\u22125) and (3, 2,\u22121,\u22123,\u22128) with F[1](1, q) = 2 \u2013 they have defect zero, but do not belong to the triple-pretzel family. Unlike triple-pretzels, they have q-dependent F[1](A, q), just qdependence vanishes at A = 1.\nSurprisingly or not, but we have not found any examples with the anomalous diagram\nHYPOTETICAL:\nsometimes for\ndefect \u03b4K = 1 s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n(6.4)\namong the descendants of 51. The DE coefficients F[1] \u223c {A} and vanishes for the Alexander polynomial only for the knots of the type (\u2212k, 2k+1, 2k+2, 1, 0) which have defect 0 and anomalous diagram (6.3), or for (k, 0, 1, 0, 1) which are just unknots. It is currently unclear if other kinds of anomalous\ndiagrams, e.g.\nHYPOTETICAL:\nsometimes for\ndefect \u03b4K = 1 s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n(6.5)\nalso appear within the family generated by 51. Clearly, one needs to consider richer family of defect-one knots, which is beyond the scope of the present paper.\n7 Recurrence relations (C-polynomials) for the colored Alexanders\nFor a given knot, the HOMFLY polynomial for different representations are not independent \u2013 infinite set of relations between them is named \u201cquantum A-polynomial\u201d, because in the quasiclassical limit it reproduces the well-known topological invariant. However, from the point of view of the knot moduli space, the knot polynomials are in any way superficial, and it makes more sense to look at the more fundamental variables. As explained in [49], the DE coefficients are better suited for this purpose. Still, they are not free, and relations between them are named C-polynomials [41,50,51] (the word \u201cquantum\u201d is omitted because classical topology does not seem to tell anything interesting for description of their quasiclassical limit).\nRelations survive even in the case A = 1, i.e. the Cpolynomials exist even for the Alexander polynomials. However, in this case they can be studied exhaustively \u2013 and actually this was done in Sect. 4.2.2 of the present paper. As we show there, at least for symmetric representations, the Alexander C-polynomials \u2013 relations between G[r ](1, q) with different r , depend only on the defect, but not on the other details of knot topology. This is exactly what we want from the future ideal relations between the colored HOMFLY polynomials \u2013 to separate the dependence on the representation from that one of the knot, and in the case of the Alexander polynomial this is partly done by separation the defect \u03b4 from the variables a(\u03b4)j at given \u03b4. It is yet unclear whether this completes the story, because we did not yet manage to understand if a(\u03b4)j are free integers or there are further relations between them. Actually, we have shown that they are free for \u03b4 = 0, and this is the case where we can claim that we know a complete set of the Alexander C-polynomials. The situation with other \u03b4 remains to be clarified.\nAnother question is to find the relation between Alexander and HOMFLYC-polynomials \u2013 whether the former ones can be lifted to the latter ones and whether the latter ones can be\nrestricted to the former ones. It is even unclear which set is bigger. In fact, the theory of C-polynomials is just at its very beginning, they are very hard to find, the known examples look ugly and are very difficult to study. Moreover, in the HOMFLY case they split into different classes, say, for given A, for given q, for certain combinations of those. In this sense, our result for the Alexander case is very encouraging \u2013 it proves that this kind of problems can have an exhaustive and elegant solution. Therefore, we hope for a new interest and progress with C-polynomials in foreseeable future."

(8.1)\nThis allows us to impose restrictions on the DE coefficients in the case of such representations. The main problem here is that these representations are not rectangular, there is a complication with multiplicities, and not so much is known about the DE for them.\nIn fact, the matching is not quite trivial, because [39]\n(i) there are multiplicities, i.e. Q in the sum\nHR = \u2211\nQ\u2282R+X FQ Z\nQ R (8.2)\nis not in one-to-one correspondence with sub-diagrams of R, (ii) since now the number of Q exceeds that one of R there is an ambiguity in the coefficients FQ and\n(iii) the Z -factors do not vanish automatically at A = 1 even for defect \u03b4 = 0.\nSee [40,57] for further available details.\n8.2 Representation R = [2, 1] for the defect \u03b4 = 0\nFor the simplest representation [21]: Z [0][2,1] = 1,\nZ [1][2,1] = [3]{A}2 + [3]2{Aq2}{A/q2}\n[2]2 ,\nZ [2][2,1] = [3] [2] {Aq 3}{Aq2}{A}{A/q2}, Z [1,1][2,1] = [3] [2] {Aq\n2}{A}{A/q2}{A/q3} , Z [2,1][2,1] = {Aq3}{Aq2}{Aq}{A/q}{A/q2}{A/q3}, Z X2[2,1] = \u2212[3]2{q}4{Aq2}{A/q2} , (8.3) and only the Z -factors in the second line vanish at {A} = 0 (this matters when the defect is zero and all FQ are not singular at A = 1). Thus, for the Alexander polynomial we have:\nA(\u03b4=0)[2,1] = 1 \u2212 [3]2{q}2F (\u03b4=0)[1] (1, q) \u2212[3]2[2]2{q}6 ( F (\u03b4=0)[2,1] (1, q) \u2212 F (\u03b4=0)X2 (1, q) ) . (8.4)\nThe very different Z -factors Z [2,1][2,1] and Z X2[2,1] almost coincide at A = 1 (just differ in sign), the ambiguity in the F-coefficients reduces to coinciding shifts of F[2,1](1, q) and FX2(1, q) (and certain change of F[2,2](1, q), which is beyond our consideration here) \u2013 in the result, what is well defined is just the difference F[2,1](1, q) \u2212 FX2(1, q).\nSince from (4.5) we know that for defect \u03b4 = 0 the DE coefficient F (\u03b4=0)[1] (1, q) is actually independent of q, comparison with (8.1) implies that F (\u03b4=0)[2,1] (1, q) = F (\u03b4=0)X2 (1, q) . (8.5) Indeed, for defect-zero twist knots Twm , the DE coefficients F[2,1] and FX2 are the sums of elements of respectively the fifth and the sixth lines of the KNTZ triangular matrix Bm+1[2,1] , see (13) of [39],\nB[2,1] = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d 1 0 0 0 0 0 \u2212A2 A2 0 0 0 0 A4 q2 \u2212[2]A4 q3 A4 q4 0 0 0 A4q2 \u2212[2]q3A4 0 A4q4 0 0 \u2212A6 [3]A6 \u2212[3]A6[2]q \u2212[3]A 6q [2] A 6 0\n\u2212A6 [3]A6 (A2\u2212q6)A4 q2(q4\u22121) \u2212 (A 2q6\u22121)A4 q4=1 0 A 4\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 ,\n(8.6)\nand it is easy to check that for all integer m the difference\nFTwm[2,1] \u2212 FTwmX2 \u223c {A} , (8.7)\ni.e. it vanishes at A = 1. The proportionality coefficient is quite a complicated polynomial of A\u00b11 and q\u00b11, thus, the statement does not look trivial.\nWe can now generalize it in two directions: to other 1-hook representations (see Sects. 8.4 and 8.5) and to non-vanishing defects (see Sect. 8.3).\n8.3 Representation R = [2, 1] for the defect \u03b4 \u2265 1\nFor non-vanishing defect, some DE coefficients FQR become singular at A = 1, and there are more terms of the DE contributing to the Alexander polynomial. This can be illustrated with the example of two-strand torus knots, which have maximal defect per intersection.\nIn the case of R = [2, 1], we expect that for \u03b4 \u2265 1 the coefficients F[2] and F[1,1](q) = F[2](q\u22121) are proportional to {A}\u22121, so that there are two more contributions to the generalization of (8.4):\nA(\u03b4>0)[2,1] = 1 \u2212 [3]2{q}2F (\u03b4>0)[1] (1, q) \u2212[3]2[2]{q}3 ( G(\u03b4>0)[2] (1, q) \u2212 G(\u03b4>0)[2] (1, q\u22121) )\n\u2212[3]2[2]2{q}6 ( F (\u03b4>0)[2,1] (1, q) \u2212 F (\u03b4>0)X2 (1, q) ) . (8.8)\nThis time, (8.1) means that\nF(\u03b4>0)[1] (1, q 3) = F(\u03b4>0)[1] (1, q) + [2]{q} ( G(\u03b4>0)[2] (1, q)\n\u2212G(\u03b4>0)[2] (1, q\u22121) )\n+ [2]2{q}4 ( F(\u03b4>0)[2,1] (1, q) \u2212 F(\u03b4>0)X2 (1, q) ) \u21d2 \u03b4\u2211\nj=1 a(\u03b4)j\n( q6 j + q\u22126 j \u2212 q2 j \u2212 q\u22122 j ) = [2]{q}\n( G(\u03b4>0)[2] (1, q) \u2212 G(\u03b4>0)[2] (1, q\u22121) ) + [2]2{q}4 ( F(\u03b4>0)[2,1] (1, q) \u2212 F(\u03b4>0)X2 (1, q) ) .\nIn particular, for \u03b4 = 1 we get from the identity q6 + q\u22126 \u2212 q2 \u2212 q\u22122 = (q2 \u2212 q\u22122)2 (2 + {q}2) : G(\u03b4=1)[2] (1, q) = a(1)1 (q2 \u2212 q\u22122) , F (\u03b4=1)[2,1] (1, q) \u2212 F (\u03b4=1)X2 (1, q) = a (1) 1 . (8.9)\nIndeed, for the simplest defect-1 torus knot 51 we have a 51 1 = \u22121, and (8.9) is satisfied. The first statement in (8.9) is the same as (4.25).\nLikewise, for \u03b4 = 2 we get a(2)1 (q\n6 + q\u22126 \u2212 q2 \u2212 q\u22122) +a(2)2 (q12 + q\u221212 \u2212 q4 \u2212 q\u22124)\n= [2]{q} ( G(\u03b4>0)[2] (1, q) \u2212 G(\u03b4>0)[2] (1, q\u22121) )\n+[2]2{q}4 ( F (\u03b4>0)[2,1] (1, q) \u2212 F (\u03b4>0)X2 (1, q) ) . (8.10)\nThis relation per se is not sufficient to find both terms in the second line, but we can substitute (4.27) for G[2](1, q) = ( a(2)1 + a(2)2 \u00b7 [2](q3 + q\u22123) ) {q2} (8.11)\nto get\nF72[2,1](1, q) \u2212 F72X2(1, q) = a (2) 1 + a(2)2\n\u00b7 ( q6 + 2q4 + 3q2 + 2 + 3q\u22122 + 2q\u22124 + q\u22126 ) . (8.12)\nIndeed, for defect-2 torus knot 71 we have a 71 1 = a712 = \u22121, and\nG72[2](1, q) = \u2212[5](q2 \u2212 q\u22122) , F72[2,1](1, q) \u2212 F72)X2 (1, q) = \u2212[3][5] . (8.13)\n8.4 Representations R = [r, 1] for the defect \u03b4 = 0\nFor the defect \u03b4 = 0 and any r , the only non-vanishing at A = 1 is the quadruple Z [0][r,1] = 1, Z [1][r,1], Z [2,1][r,1] and Z X2[r,1], so that\nA(\u03b4=0)[r,1] = 1 \u2212 [r + 1]2{q}2F (\u03b4=0)[1] (1, q) \u2212[2][r + 1]2[r ][r \u2212 1]{q}6 \u00d7 ( F (\u03b4=0)[2,1] (1, q) \u2212 F (\u03b4=0)X2 (1, q) ) . (8.14)\nComparison with (8.1) gives:\nF (\u03b4=0)[2,1] (1, q) = F (\u03b4=0)X2 (1, q) , (8.15) which is just the same (8.5) for all r .\n8.5 Representations R = [r, 1s\u22121] for the defect \u03b4 = 0\nFirst, let us obtain the DE for the Alexander polynomial for R = [r, 1s\u22121] and the defect \u03b4 = 0. For this representation: HK[r,1s\u22121](q, A = qL+1) = HK[r\u22121](q, A = qs)\n\u21d2 HK[r,1s\u22121](q, A) \u2212HK[r\u22121](q, A) \u223c {Aq\u2212s} . (8.16)\nLooking at lots of examples, we induce that\nAK[r,1s\u22121] = AK[r\u22121] +G[1](1, q){q\u2212s}{q2r+s\u22122}\n= 1 \u2212 F[1](1, q){qr\u22121}2 +G[1](1, q){q\u2212s}{q2r+s\u22122} . (8.17)\nFor example, we have:\n\u2022 for 31: G[1](1, q) = \u22121 \u2022 for 41: G[1](1, q) = 1 \u2022 for 52: G[1](1, q) = \u22122\nNote that result (8.17) are in a straightforward correspondence with the results of Sects. 8.2 and 8.4.\nComparing (8.17) and (8.1), we obtain\nG[1](1, q) = F[1](1, q) = a(\u03b4)0 .

            "text": "The purpose of this paper is to study the implications of the differential expansion (1.2) for the special case of the symmetrically-colored Alexander polynomials (A = 1), which satisfy (4.1). In other words, we studied the combined implications of (1.2) and (4.1).\nThe main result is the proof of the conjecture [48] that the defect \u03b4, which was originally defined as characteristic of factorization depth of the coefficients of differential expansion for the HOMFLY polynomials in symmetric representations, can be alternatively related to the degree \u03b4 + 1 of the fundamental Alexander polynomial (see Sect. 4.2.1). We have provided explicit formula for all other DE coefficients at A = 1 in terms of the fundamental Alexander polynomial and explain that they are not free (see Sect. 4.2.2).\nWe address the question, if the fundamental Alexander coefficients are free, and as an example demonstrate that for \u03b4 = 0 they are (see Sect. 5.3). We use for this purpose the family of antiparallel descendants of the trefoil. Our results in this case can be interpreted as the full separation of representation and knot variables, i.e. a complete set ofC-polynomials (see Sect. 7).\nLooking at different descendants of the trefoil we also observe the defect peculiarities, which make the statement of the defect-preserving theorem more precise (see Sect. 6).\nSimilar calculations for other defects (not only \u03b4 = 0), other representations (not only symmetric) and other knot polynomials (not only Alexanders) remain to be done. We describe just the simplest steps in these directions (see Sects. 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 8), which prove that they are indeed interesting and doable.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank Nikita Tselousov for useful discussions.
