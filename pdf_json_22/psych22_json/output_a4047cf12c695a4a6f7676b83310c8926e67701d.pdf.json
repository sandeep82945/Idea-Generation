A one-way repeated measures MANOVA was\ncarried out in order to evaluate these assessments, and a mediation analysis\nwas done to determine the relationship between them.\nResults: The experimental group significantly improved (p < 0.05) from the pre-test to the post-test for several subtests of the TGMD-3 and the GARS-3.\nConclusion: The study shows that participation in an adapted judo program clearly helps to improve the motor skills and psychosocial behaviors of\nchildren with ASD.\nKEYWORDS\ncombat sports, ASD, TGMD, GARS, intellectual disabilities, adapted sports\nIntroduction\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with an unknown cause that manifests in difficulties and barriers associated with social communication and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). There has been a recent increase in the prevalence of ASD among children, as in the mid-1990s it was thought to affect 11.6 out of 1,000 people in this age group (Baird et\u00a0al., 2006), while more recent studies have put this figure as high as 18.5 per 1,000 (Maenner et\u00a0al., 2020).\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 29 November 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1067310"

They are often characterized by a lack of motivation, resistance to change, and difficulties following social rules (Habib et\u00a0 al., 2018). Additionally, people with ASD often have problems with motor skills (Colombo-Dougovito and Block, 2019; Crucitti et\u00a0al., 2020), affecting their ability to interact with others including successful social participation (Bodison, 2015).\nIt is yet unclear whether these motor difficulties are a direct consequence of the disorder itself or whether they emerge from an amalgam of other factors, such as a lack of opportunities to practice these abilities or a lack of motivation. It is clear, though, that children with ASD tend to lag behind their peers without the disorder when it comes to motor development (Pan et\u00a0al., 2017; Sansi et\u00a0al., 2021). This means that it is sometimes difficult for children with ASD to participate in activities that require motor skills that would otherwise be\u00a0typical for their age groups, thereby further limiting their opportunities for social interaction.\nSubstantial evidence exists detailing these motor limitations. Studies have found that children with ASD perform poorly compared to their peers across various motor domains including balance, postural control and overall coordination (Downey and Rapport, 2012), gait disturbances, lateral movement and fine motor skills (Kaur et\u00a0 al., 2018). During early infancy, the differences in motor development between children with and without ASD are less pronounced. However, starting at about 18 months, the gap becomes more apparent, with children with ASD displaying less interest in play and spontaneous games (Serrada-Tejeda et\u00a0al., 2021). This could further affect their motor and sensory development and, in turn, lead them to participate less in leisure and social activities throughout childhood.\nThe positive impact of physical exercise reducing ASD symptomology and the associated comorbidities has been sufficiently explored. Several systematic reviews and metaanalyses focused on synthesizing the effects of physical activity and sports participation in this population (Hume et\u00a0al., 2021). Potential benefits noted in the literature include how physical activity can contribute to improvements in the social relations and communication skills of those with ASD (Bremer et\u00a0al., 2016; Howells et\u00a0al., 2019; Chan et\u00a0al., 2021), how exercise can help reduce stereotyped behaviors (Ferreira et\u00a0al., 2019), and the broad range of improvements in motor skills, social skills, and physical fitness resulting from these types of interventions (Sowa and Meulenbroek, 2012; Sam et\u00a0al., 2015; Healy et\u00a0al., 2018).\nParticipating in combat sports can help improve the physical and mental health of children with ASD, particularly when it comes to improving participants\u2019 motor skills (Kim et\u00a0al., 2016; Sarabzadeh et\u00a0al., 2019), but there are also studies evaluating the benefits in social terms. For example, researchers have shown that karate training can significantly reduce stereotyped behaviors and improve social interaction (Bahrami et\u00a0al., 2012; Movahedi et\u00a0al., 2013). It is worth highlighting that martial arts and combat sports training requires moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and, simultaneously, the need\nfor concentration and self-control (Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019). These sports may also appeal to young people with ASD because of the repetitive nature of the tasks involved in the training (Bell et\u00a0al., 2016).\nAmong martial arts, the specific characteristics of judo, with its alternating phases of vigorous physical activity and low-intensity exercises focused on mindfulness, may provide an ideal method to reduce the stress response (e.g., cortisol levels) of young people with ASD (Renziehausen et\u00a0al., 2022). Indeed, a recent systematic review (Pe\u010dnikar Oblak et\u00a0al., 2020) highlights the health and psychosocial benefits that people with mental disabilities can gain from participating in adapted judo programs. Short-term judo programs have reduced repetitive behaviors and improved social communication, interaction, and emotional responsiveness (Morales et\u00a0al., 2021). At the same time, a study with an eight-week intervention (Rivera et\u00a0 al., 2020) found a decrease in aggressive behaviors among children with ASD who had taken part in an adapted judo program. Other researchers have demonstrated the viability and effectiveness of these programs, observing that the participants tend to embrace and enjoy adapted judo and express a desire to continue participating (Tomey, 2017). Adapted judo programs have registered good adherence rates leading to overall increases in moderate-tovigorous physical activity (Garcia et\u00a0 al., 2019). However, the impact of participation in extended-duration judo training beyond 8 weeks in children with ASD has yet to be\u00a0fully explored.\nIn light of this evidence of the effectiveness of adapted judo programs for people with ASD, the main objective of this study is to determine the effects of a long-term adapted judo program on the motor skills and psychosocial behaviors in children with ASD. The secondary objective is to observe the relationship between motor skills and the severity of psychosocial behavior symptoms of children with ASD. The hypothesis is that the participants in the adapted judo program will improve the motor skills and psychosocial behaviors assessed in the study."

            "text": "The experimental group took part in a 6-month adapted judo program. The judo sessions were performed in a large, wellventilated, and safe space suitable for judo practice. The judo mat had a surface area of 120 m2 and was made of high-density foam designed to reduce the impact of falls, ensuring safe practice. Each participant was outfitted with a judogi (the judo suit consisting of a cotton jacket, trousers, and a belt).\nParticipants completed one session per week of 90 min of duration. Two judo teachers with 7th and 6th degree black belts, with academic backgrounds in pedagogy and sports sciences, respectively, led the sessions, and at least four volunteer judo instructors lent support. The sessions consisted of judo-specific\ntasks preceded by a warm-up and ending with a cool-down. As previously employed in other studies of our research group (Morales et\u00a0al., 2021), the judo-specific content of the sessions included:\n\u2022 Different types of general movements and falling techniques (from stepping in all directions to body repositioning and turning, movements from stable to unstable supports). \u2022 Simplified judo-specific movements and games (building up body contact through games, primary focus on essential/simplified judo movements). \u2022 Body control techniques on the ground and throws (progression of techniques from simplified to more complex movements). \u2022 Repetitions of basic technical movements in different directions (pulling, pushing, holding, lifting).\nThe method of instruction utilized the principle of gradual progression, ensuring the consolidation of concepts learned in the initial lessons before moving on to more complex activities and material. Each participant progressed at his or her own pace.\nThe judo program was adapted by applying the principle: \u201cnormal where possible, adapted where necessary\u201d (Morales et\u00a0al., 2022). The main attributes of our adapted judo program were:\n\u2022 The learning method chosen was imitation. The instructor presented techniques and then guided the practice. \u2022 The employment of very marked routines based on brief and clear instructions in the form of the five \u201cW\u201d (who, when, what, where, why). \u2022 Judo teachers spoke in a calm and firm voice. They gave objective instructions and refrained from using figurative language or irony. \u2022 It can be\u00a0deduced that sometimes it can be\u00a0difficult for people with ASD to see the big picture because they perceive so many details. \u2022 Instructors were trained to keep calm and not criticize the slowness of reproducing movements that sometimes characterize people with ASD. \u2022 Spontaneous and unexpected behavior changes were monitored and redirected by judo teachers. They were aware that each participant required their own time. \u2022 Instructions were given repetitively and employed a broad spectrum of senses, not only verbal cues. The isolated use of sensory instructions, one at a time, can support perception. For example, the instructor may physically demonstrate with verbal instructions and once without speaking."

The assessment includes subscales measuring Locomotor Skills and Ball Skills, representing the fundamental motor skills most commonly taught in physical education classes worldwide. This study used a visual support protocol previously validated for children with ASD (Allen et\u00a0al., 2017), whereby the instructors explained the test elements via a combination of illustrated cards, verbal instructions and physical demonstrations.\nIn addition to detecting delays and limitations in children\u2019s gross motor skill development, the TGMD-3 can also be\u00a0used as a research tool to explore gross motor skills, both among children with a typical development pattern and among those with atypical movement functioning (Ulrich, 2019). The Locomotor Skills subscale features six movements that require coordination and movements in various directions (Run, Gallop, Hop, Skip, Horizontal jump, Slide). The Ball Skills subscale assesses throwing, hitting and catching skills through seven tasks: Two-hand strike, One-hand strike, Dribble, Two-hand catch, Kick, Overhand throw, and Underhand throw. The test is video recorded and later analyzed by trained independent (blinded) raters using a screening tool and the criteria set out in the TGMD-3 for each task. Participants are assigned a score of \u201c1\u201d for each task they successfully completed and a score of \u201c0\u201d when they do not meet the criteria. After this analysis, the locomotor and ball skills subscale scores are summed, yielding a raw total TGMD-3 score.\nThe GARS-3 is an instrument used to assess changes in the severity of ASD behaviors. As described in a previous work of our research group (Morales et\u00a0al., 2021), the GARS-3 includes 56 items describing characteristic behaviors of individuals with ASD. The items are grouped into six subscales: repetitive behaviors (RB), social interaction (SI), social communication (SC), emotional responses (ER), cognitive style (CS), and maladaptive speech (MS). Parents and caregivers had to score each item on a four-point Likert-type scale (0 = never observed; to 3 = frequently observed) spending approximately from 5 to 10 min, and based on the frequency of occurrence of each item under ordinary circumstances in a 6-h period. The raw scores for each subscale were summed, yielding a total GARS-3 score. Both the pre-and post-tests were carried out using pen and paper. Parents and caregivers had the opportunity to ask questions about item interpretation."

As such, guided activities like the judo sessions described within this study might be\u00a0needed to encourage the participation of children with ASD in physical activity. In fact, some prior studies of short-term adapted judo programs for children with this disorder have achieved high adherence among participants, increased moderate-to-vigorous physical exercise (Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019), and improved satisfaction and self-confidence (Tomey, 2017).\nWe have been unable to find other studies that have examined the improvement of the motor skills of children with ASD through judo. There are, however, some examples of research using other martial arts disciplines or other combat sports, such as a case study observing the balance and postural control benefits of an\nintervention program based on aikido (Polak et\u00a0al., 2019) and another eight-week intervention using taekwondo (Kim et\u00a0al., 2016). Systematic participation in judo requires balance and coordination tasks as well as the development of grip strength (Demiral, 2011). In addition to the usual elements of judo, the adapted program that was applied in this study included a large number of judo-specific movement exercises that coincided with the tasks assessed on the Locomotor Skills subscale of the TGMD-3, meaning that it was reasonable to expect the improvements that were achieved in this regard. Meanwhile, there is evidence that participation in judo can also help improve motor skills such as agility, coordination and balance among neurotypical children (Protic-Gava et\u00a0 al., 2019; Purnamasari et\u00a0 al., 2021). Another study featuring a year-long judo program in children found improvements in various domains of motor skills and physical fitness, such as hand strength, flexibility and overall coordination (Toski\u0107 et\u00a0al., 2014), while judo training has been shown to improve body posture, balance and lower limb muscle strength (Walaszek et\u00a0al., 2017).\nMeanwhile, Lo et\u00a0al. (2019) have shown that using judo in school can improve spatial orientation skills. These researchers recommended using judo with people with ASD in order to improve their executive functioning. Our results echo these findings, as the participants showed improvements in postural control and spatio-temporal orientation (Run, Gallop, Hop, Skip, Horizontal jump, Slide) following the intervention. Additionally, a high degree of correlation was found between motor skills and executive functioning, suggesting a relationship between these two constructs and those interventions aimed at one of these two areas might also impact the other (Hilton et\u00a0al., 2014). In light of\nFIGURE\u00a03 Pre- and post-scores on the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-Third Edition (GARS-3) subscales forrepetitive behaviors (RB), social interaction (SI), social communication (SC), emotional responses (ER), cognitive style (CS), and maladaptive speech (MS) after 6 months of adapted judo program intervention. *Significant differences (p < 0.05).\nTABLE\u00a02 The approximate mediating role of the variation of motor skills in the relationship between psychosocial behaviors and motor skills."

The results are similar to those found in our previous work following an eight-week intervention (Morales et\u00a0 al., 2021). In both cases, significant improvements were recorded on six of the subscales of the GARS-3, although the list of scales with significant differences was not the same in the two studies. There were no significant differences in the subscale measuring maladaptive speech in either of the studies, which might indicate that participating in sports does not tend to improve the language skills of people with ASD, as previously reported following an intervention involving horseback riding (Gabriels et\u00a0al., 2015). Compared to the earlier short-term judo intervention, one unique finding of the current study is that the Communication subscale did not display significant improvements. This result stands in contrast with the general trend reported in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of physical activity and sports participation interventions (Bremer et\u00a0al., 2016; Healy et\u00a0 al., 2018; Howells et\u00a0 al., 2019), which have observed improvements in communication skills presumably due to the experiences of teamwork and social interaction.\nThe overall results regarding psychosocial behaviors coincide with previous investigations following short-term adapted judo programs, which have been found to decrease stress, increase satisfaction with the activity, and improvements in social relations (Rivera et\u00a0al., 2020; Renziehausen et\u00a0al., 2022). These findings are further confirmed by other experiences with neurotypical people that have found that participating in judo increases empathy, reduces aggressive behavior (Ennigkeit and Beek, 2019) and contributes to the development of self-discipline, serenity, efficient problem solving and socio-moral sensitivity (SterkowiczPrzybycie\u0144 et\u00a0al., 2014). It is also worth highlighting the successful record of adaptations of other martial arts in reducing stereotyped behaviors and improving social interactions within this population (Bahrami et\u00a0al., 2012; Movahedi et\u00a0al., 2013; Phung and Goldberg, 2019). Combat sports and martial arts like judo have clear structures and other elements that make them very suitable for people with ASD and are likely to contribute to improvements in various aspects of their everyday lives. These kinds of sports can be\u00a0adapted to the individual characteristics of each participant and can be\u00a0 applied in different contexts, such as various exercise intensities that might cater to children with ASD. Additionally, these sports are highly structured and involve repetitive movements that are easily mimicked and mental imagery with opponents (Bahrami et\u00a0al., 2012). One possible reason for the effectiveness of the adapted judo program was that it was designed according to some of the traditional tenets of martial arts training. In other words, it extended beyond physical activity, with additional emphases on self-discipline and behavioral, emotional and cognitive control, as previously recommended for combat\nsports and martial arts interventions for children with ASD (Morales et\u00a0al., 2021).\nConcerning the secondary objective of this study, the results showed a significant relationship between the variables measuring motor skills and those measuring psychosocial behaviors. The participants\u2019 total TGMD-3 scores directly affected the total GARS-3 score, with the mediation calculated at 96.24%. The same mediation analysis also showed a significant total effect, as determined by the mediation effect calculated by adding the direct effect and the indirect effect represented by the variation in scores on the TGMD-3 during the intervention period. These results suggest that motor skills and psychosocial behaviors are closely linked and that interventions addressing motor skills may influence this relationship to an extent.\nThere is considerable evidence showing that children with ASD experience greater difficulties with motor development than their peers (Miyahara, 2013). MacDonald et\u00a0al. (2014) found a correlation between gross and fine motor skills and the severity of ASD. Specifically, they observed that more severe cases of ASD were associated with poorer fine and gross motor skills. Beyond delays in motor development among children with ASD, researchers have found links between these motor problems and the development of language and cognitive abilities (Bedford et\u00a0al., 2016) and adaptive conduct (MacDonald et\u00a0al., 2013), as well as between motor development and social skills (MacDonald et\u00a0al., 2013).\nOne question that regularly emerges within the scientific literature on this topic is whether motor difficulties should be\u00a0viewed as a central characteristic of ASD and whether this disorder should be\u00a0 co-diagnosed along with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD; Camden et\u00a0al., 2022). Sumner et\u00a0al. (2016) examined the relationship between motor skills and social abilities in a group of people with ASD, another with DCD and a control group in children, finding a good deal of overlap between the assessments of the motor and social skills of the ASD and DCD groups, both of which recorded lower scores than the control. Additionally, motor skills were found to predict social functioning in both of these groups.\nFundamental motor skills are the building blocks in developing more complex gross motor movements. If the intervention described here successfully improved motor skills, then the participants should be\u00a0inspired to take a more positive view of their own motor abilities. This, in turn, might encourage them to continue participating in judo, as has been the case with other judo programs for people with ASD (Tomey, 2017; Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019). Judo programs could also positively affect their social functioning and physical health. Importantly, it could also help them develop the motor skills needed to participate in other sports and physical activity programs with their neurotypical peers (Colombo-Dougovito and Block, 2019).\nIn childhood, free play is an opportunity to develop a range of motor skills. There does not seem to be\u00a0any reason why children with ASD should not participate in play as neurotypical children do, but starting at the age of two the former tend to reduce their\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nfree play interactions (Serrada-Tejeda et\u00a0al., 2021). However, they continue to display interest in directed play. In addition to offering directed activities, it is important to strive to adopt an inclusive approach to increase their effectiveness in physical activity interventions (Sansi et\u00a0 al., 2021). This could help address the difficulties that people with ASD often have in finding activities that meet their needs. Some of the motor development problems experienced by children with ASD might be\u00a0due to this lack of opportunity. Adapted sports programs like the one described here are useful because they are designed specifically for the enjoyment of children with ASD and offer them the chance to contact other children. The characteristics of judo training mean that there is a combination of peer learning, which helps improve the relationships among the students with ASD, and guided activities where they learn the technique of the sport by imitating their instructors. Finally, the structure of judo sessions and the routines associated with the sport, such as formal procedures, including bowing, might help the participants overcome some of the difficulties they face in their everyday lives and at school.\nThis study may have some limitations because the data was collected from non-blinded caregivers, which was the case for the GARS-3. This can be\u00a0 a source of confusion in this type of intervention-based research, as it can be\u00a0 unclear whether the knowledge of the intervention by the caregivers could influence their answers or whether the results could be\u00a0affected by subjective factors such as the expectations involved with the adapted judo program. In any case, the GARS-3 protocol recommends that the people most familiar with the participants\u2019 behavior complete the questionnaire. Furthermore, the sampling distribution within groups was not randomized. As stated in the methods section, they were distributed into two groups according to their willingness and commitment to participate in an adapted judo program over a school year. The lack of randomization could have biased the results; nevertheless, experimental and control groups presented similar values in all the dependent variables at the pre-test, indicating that they were homogeneous groups at the beginning of the intervention."

            "text": "The most important conclusions of this study are that participating in a 6-months adapted judo program improved the motor skills and psychosocial behaviors of children with ASD. We\u00a0 can also conclude that there is a close relationship between motor skills and psychosocial behaviors, as the children with greater severity of autism-related behaviors were likely to display poorer motor skills. Meanwhile, the adaptation of the judo program increases its efficiency and could help participants adapt better to their everyday lives and improve their quality of life. In the present work, we\u00a0have presented judo-specific content and instructional cues that could help apply the judo program to young people with ASD. Future research is warranted to study the\neffects of adapted judo programs in adults with ASD or other intellectual disabilities."
