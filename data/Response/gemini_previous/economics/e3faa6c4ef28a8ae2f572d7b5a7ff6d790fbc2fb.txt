1. **Investigate the impact of price negotiations on the accessibility and affordability of innovative anticancer drugs for patients in China.** This could be done by conducting a longitudinal study to track the prices of these drugs over time and by surveying patients to assess their ability to afford these drugs.


2. **Examine the relationship between the clinical benefits of innovative anticancer drugs and their costs in other countries.** This could be done by conducting a cross-country study to compare the prices and clinical benefits of these drugs in different healthcare systems.


3. **Develop a more comprehensive framework for assessing the value of innovative anticancer drugs.** This framework could include factors such as the severity of the disease, the patient's quality of life, and the cost-effectiveness of the drug.


4. **Evaluate the impact of real-world data on the assessment of the clinical benefits of innovative anticancer drugs.** This could be done by conducting a study to compare the clinical benefits of these drugs in real-world settings to their clinical benefits in clinical trials.


5. **Explore the role of patient preferences in the assessment of the value of innovative anticancer drugs.** This could be done by conducting a study to survey patients to assess their preferences for different attributes of these drugs, such as their efficacy, safety, and cost.
