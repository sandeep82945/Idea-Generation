            "text": "The recent direct observations of Gravitational Wave (GW) signals [2\u201311] have opened a new exciting era for astronomical and cosmological studies. The increase in sensitivity of current and upcoming detectors [12\u201316], both ground-based (e.g. the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory, LIGO1, the VIRGO interferometer2, the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector, KAGRA3, the Einstein Telescope, ET4, the Cosmic Explorer, CE5), and space-based (e.g. the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, LISA6, and the Deci-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory, DECIGO7) will provide measurements of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) of both astrophysical and cosmological origins. In this context, a complete characterisation of the astrophysical SGWB and its evolution is crucial to distinguish it from the cosmological SGWB and obtain fundamental information about the very early universe. In particular, the analysis of the anisotropies in intensity (e.g. [17]) and polarisation (e.g. [18, 19]) of the latter would reveal the details of different physical processes in the inflationary era. The study of the SGWB intensity [20\u201335] has been performed so far with approaches similar to those used for the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): its evolution is described by a phase-space distribution function obeying\n1https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/ 2https://www.virgo-gw.eu/ 3https://gwcenter.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/ 4http://www.et-gw.eu 5https://cosmicexplorer.org/ 6https://www.lisamission.org/ 7https://decigo.jp/index_E.html\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nthe collisionless Boltzmann equation in a background perturbed by the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the universe [36\u201340]. This approximation applies in the so-called geometrical optics limit [41\u201345], i.e. when the GW wavelengths are much smaller than the typical spatial scale on which the perturbed background varies. As such, on cosmological scales, higher frequency gravitons behave as effectively spin-2 massless particles freely moving along geodesics. However, regarding the collisionless aspect of this treatment, as pointed out by Ref. [1], in the proximity of compact or extended massive objects, such as stars or black holes, graviton wavelengths could be much larger than the scale of variation of the spacetime generated by such structures, and wave effects, producing SWGB polarisation, need to be accounted for. In this respect, Ref. [1] has included the emissivity term in the Boltzmann equation of the SGWB intensity, but neglected the collision term, under the reasonable assumption that scattering effects, and the resultant SGWB polarisation, can be computed discarding the back reaction of polarisation on intensity. In this work we present a set of Boltzmann equations for both the SGWB intensity and polarisation, with collision terms able to couple the system equations by including the SGWB scattering off of massive structures. To this aim, we exploit an approach similar to the treatment of CMB photons [46\u201350], where both the incoming and the scattered photons are considered free fields and the interaction term is a function of them [49]. In this case we consider the so-called Born approximation, i.e. we assume the GW propagation and scattering processes as characterised by two different length scales, the mean free path and the scattering length, with the assumption that, for weak enough couplings, the former is much larger than the latter. Under these hypotheses, for the gravitational scattering from massive objects, in the SGWB Boltzmann equations we consider as collision source the so-called Compton graviton-scalar scattering in the low-energy limit [51\u201355]. This paper is organised as follows: in Sec. 2 we report the definitions of the density matrix and Stokes parameters for GW backgrounds; in Sec. 3 we review the main features of the Compton cross-section entering the RHS of the collisional Boltzmann equations, in the case of the scattering of gravitons off of massive objects. We highlight the results obtained in the literature (e.g. [1, 53\u201356]) and used in our computations; in Sec. 4 we derive the full set of Boltzmann equations for the Stokes parameters of GW backgrounds; in Sec. 5 we analyse the main features of the scattered SGWB intensity and polarisation anisotropies; in Sec. 6 we present and discuss the solution for the intensity and polarisation angular power spectra in the case of a simplified, toy-model scenario; finally, in the last Section we draw our conclusions."

The standard plane wave expansion of a generic GW, hij , in the so-called transverse traceless gauge, is given by\nhij(t,x) = \u2211\nP=+,\u00d7\n\u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e df \u222b S2 d\u2126hP (f,n)e2\u03c0if(t\u2212n\u00b7x)ePij(n), (2.1)\nwhere S2 is the unit sphere for the angular integral, the unit vector n = (sin \u03b8 cos\u03c6, sin \u03b8 sin\u03c6, cos \u03b8) is the propagation direction, e+ij = [e\u0302\u03b8 \u2297 e\u0302\u03b8 \u2212 e\u0302\u03c6 \u2297 e\u0302\u03c6]ij and e\u00d7ij = [e\u0302\u03b8\u2297 e\u0302\u03c6+ e\u0302\u03c6\u2297 e\u0302\u03b8]ij is the basis for transverse-traceless tensors such that eAijeB ij = 2\u03b4AB\n\u2013 2 \u2013\n(A,B = +,\u00d7) where e\u0302\u03b8 and e\u0302\u03c6 are two unit vectors with a fixed spherical coordinate system. As the observed hij(t,x) is real, one has a relation for the complex conjugate: hP (\u2212f,n) = hP (f,n)\u2217. When replacing the direction n\u2192 \u2212n, one has e+ij \u2192 e + ij (even parity) and e\u00d7ij \u2192 \u2212e \u00d7 ij (odd parity). The covariance matrix, \u03c1(f,n), between two polarisation modes, h+(f,n) and h\u00d7(f \u2032,n\u2032), is given in terms of the GW Stokes parameters, I, Q, U , V , as [57]:\n\u03c1(f,n) = \u03b4(f, f \u2032) ( I +Q U \u2212 iV U + iV I \u2212Q ) \u03b4D(n\u2212 n\u2032) 4\u03c0 , (2.2)\nwhere\nI(f,n) = \u2329 |h+(f,n)|2 + |h\u00d7(f,n)|2 \u232a /2 , (2.3)\nQ(f,n) = \u2329 |h+(f,n)|2 \u2212 |h\u00d7(f,n)|2 \u232a /2 , (2.4) U(f,n) = \u3008h+(f,n)h\u00d7(f,n)\u2217 + h+(f,n)\u2217h\u00d7(f,n)\u3009 /2 , (2.5) V (f,n) = i \u3008h+(f,n)h\u00d7(f,n)\u2217 \u2212 h+(f,n)\u2217h\u00d7(f,n)\u3009 /2 . (2.6)\nFrom now on, we omit the f -dependence for simplicity. The symbol \u3008. . .\u3009 represents the ensemble average for a superposition of stationary incoherent waves, and \u03b4D(\u00b7) is the delta function on the unit sphere. The parameter I(n) represents the total intensity of the SGWB, Q(n) and U(n) are related to its linear polarisation, and V (n) to the circular polarisation. When the basis vectors, e\u0302\u03b8 and e\u0302\u03c6, are rotated around the propagation direction, n, by an angle \u03b3, the parameters I and V are invariant (spin 0), while the combinations (Q\u00b1 iU)(n) transform as (Q\u00b1 iU)\u2032(n\u2032) = e\u22134i\u03b3(Q\u00b1 iU)(n), i.e. they are objects of spin s = \u00b14 [60]. Eq. (2.2) represents the so-called density matrix, in the linear polarisation basis eij+/\u00d7, of an ensemble of gravitons in mixed state, and can be written in short notation as:\n\u03c1 = (I1 +Q\u03c33 + U\u03c31 + V \u03c32) /2, (2.7)\nwhere 1 is the identity matrix, and \u03c3i are the Pauli spin matrices. Thus the density matrix for an ensemble of gravitons contains the same information as the four Stokes parameters, and the time evolution of the density matrix provides the time evolution of the system. In the considered quasi-classical limit, and for astrophysical SGWB, one can assume that the graviton phase-space distribution function, f(x\u00b5, p\u00b5) (treated in Sec. 4 below), is given by the Wigner distribution function, i.e. the Wigner transform of the density matrix [61\u201367]. Under such a hypothesis, in the following we will assume that, as for CMB photons, perturbations to the graviton density matrix correspond to perturbations to the classical gravitational Stokes parameters describing the intensity and polarisation of the astrophysical SGWB, and behaving as phase-space distribution functions which obey the respective Boltzmann equation with a collision term given by the gravitational Compton scattering from massive objects in the low energy limit [53]."

            "text": "The process of GW scattering off of compact and massive objects, treated as spin-0 quantities, has been studied since the sixties via several methods, both from quantum-mechanical [52\u201354] and classical [51, 55, 56, 68] perspectives. Here we review results in the literature (e.g. [1, 53\u201356]), which in turn will enter the collision term in the RHS of the SGWB Boltzmann equations representing the real novelty of this work. In particular, we will consider the long\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nwavelength/weak-field limit of gravitational Compton scattering, i.e. when the wavelength, \u03bb, of the incoming wave is assumed to be much larger than the Schwarzschild radius, rs = 2GM , of the scattering object of mass M , i.e. \u03c0rs/\u03bb = M\u03c9 1 [55]. We use units of c = 1 and, in first approximation, neglect any possible angular momentum of the compact object since it has been suggested that, to first order in M\u03c9, gravitational waves do not exhibit angularmomentum-induced effects [56]. In particular, considering a gravitational wave with polarisation tensor \u0302\u2032ij hitting, from the direction n\u2032, a compact object of mass M and zero angular momentum, the differential cross section, in the TT gauge and in the rest frame of the object, is [56]\nd\u03c3 \u2032 d\u2126 = (GM)2 sin4 \u03b2/2 |\u0302\u2032ij \u0302ij |2 , (3.1)\nwhere \u0302ij is the outgoing polarisation of the wave, and \u03b2 is the angle between the incoming and outgoing directions. In the so-called scattering plane geometry, one can decompose the polarisation basis in terms of a pair of unit vectors normal to the direction of propagation, l\u0302 for the vector in the scattering plane and m\u0302 for the vector normal to it, and write\n\u0302+ij = l\u0302i l\u0302j \u2212 m\u0302im\u0302j \u0302\u00d7ij = l\u0302im\u0302j + m\u0302i l\u0302j . (3.2)\nUsing a similar decomposition for the incoming polarisation tensor \u0302\u2032ij , and the relation between the \u201cprimed\u201d and \u201cunprimed\u201d vectors in terms of the incoming direction n\u2032:\nl \u00b7 l\u2032 = n \u00b7 n\u2032 = cos\u03b2 , m \u00b7m\u2032 = 1, (3.3)\none then obtains the relations\n\u0302+ij \u0302 +\u2032ij = 1 + cos2 \u03b2 \u0302\u00d7ij \u0302 \u00d7\u2032ij = 2 cos\u03b2 \u0302+ij \u0302 \u00d7\u2032ij = \u0302\u00d7ij \u0302 +\u2032ij = 0 . (3.4)\nFinally, using Eqs. (3.1)-(3.4), one can derive the polarisation-summed cross section averaged over the initial polarisation states, e\u2032ij(n\n\u2032) (unpolarised incident GWs), and summed over the final states, eij(n) [1, 53\u201356]\nd\u03c3 d\u2126 = 1 2\n(GM)2\nsin4 \u03b2/2 \u2211 A=+,\u00d7 \u2211 B=+,\u00d7 |\u0302Aij \u0302B \u2032ij |2 =\n= (GM)2\n8\n1 + 6 cos2 \u03b2 + cos4 \u03b2\nsin4(\u03b2/2) (3.5)\nHowever, here we are interested in investigating how the GW components h+ and h\u00d7 get modified in the scattering event. It comes out that, similarly to the electromagnetic case, the plus and cross amplitudes need to be multiplied by their respective factors in Eq. (3.4), but\n\u2013 4 \u2013\na polarisation-independent angular dependence is also present, such that\nh+ = GM sin2 \u03b2/2 h\u2032ij \u0302 + ij = GM\n(1 + cos2 \u03b2)\nsin2 \u03b2/2 h\u2032+\nh\u00d7 = GM sin2 \u03b2/2 h\u2032ij \u0302 \u00d7 ij = GM 2 cos\u03b2 sin2 \u03b2/2 h\u2032\u00d7 . (3.6)\nNote that, unlike the electromagnetic case, in gravitational wave scattering the helicity is not conserved and the scattering cross section is nonzero in the backward direction, implying the existence of a helicity-reversing amplitude [55, 56]. Moreover, Eq. (3.5) diverges as \u03b2\u22124 for small scattering angles, i.e. in the forward scattering direction. This feature is the gravitational equivalent of the Rutherford\u2019s angular dependence in electromagnetism, and, as pointed out in Refs. [1, 51, 52, 69], it is related to the long range nature of the gravitational interaction, or, alternatively, to the non-linear nature of Einstein\u2019s equations [54]. In this work, in order to fix this divergence, we follow and summarise in this Section the method proposed by Ref. [1] which introduces a natural cutoff scale on \u03b2, in order to deal with a well-defined total cross-section of the process. In particular, as pointed out in Ref. [1], this is a standard procedure when considering Boltzmann equations for systems where long range interactions are involved, such as the Coulomb scattering in plasma (e.g. Ref. [70] and references therein). The cutoff scale comes from the observation that wave-like effects are non-negligible only within a region whose size is given by the square root of the Kretschmann scalar, K, associated to the metric generated by the scattering object. Assuming this is well approximated by a Schwarzschild metric, one has \u221a K = 2 \u221a 3rs/r\n3, where r is the distance from the centre of the object. Therefore, for wavelengths \u03bb\u22122 . 2 \u221a 3rs/r\n3, i.e. r . (2 \u221a 3rs\u03bb\n2)1/3 \u2261 R\u03bb, wave-effects are non-negligible. The region, defined by R\u03bb, around the scattering object, depends on both its size and the wavelength of the incoming GW. In the far-field regime, the relation between the scattering angle, \u03b2, and the impact parameter, b, of a graviton geodesic, is given by \u03b2 \u2248 2rs/b. Therefore, if an upper bound exists for b, one can find a corresponding lower bound on \u03b2. The idea proposed by Ref. [1] is to choose bmax = R\u03bb, so that the minimum value of the scattering angle is given by \u03b2min = 2 (rs/R\u03bb) =[ 4r2s/( \u221a 3\u03bb2)\n]1/3 . Analogously, Ref. [1] provides also an upper bound \u03b2max \u2248 2 for the impact parameter of compact objects, which translates in a lower bound bmin. Moreover, assuming that for sources corresponding to black holes, wave effects occur in a region rs < r < R\u03bb, implying rs < R\u03bb, it follows that a limit for the observed and redshifted wavelength, \u03bbobs = (1 + z)\u03bb, of a GW scattered by a massive object of mass M at redshift z, is given by\n\u03bbobs \u2265 10\u221213 ( M\nM\n) (1 + z) pc. (3.7)\nThus, GWs with relatively small wavelengths are affected only by scattering due to small mass objects, while GWs with large \u03bb receive contribution from massive objects as well. In Tab. 1 we summarise the scattering masses of compact sources which fall in the observational ranges of ongoing and upcoming GW experiments. Finally, adopting the above limits on the scattering angle and integrating Eq. (3.5) over the solid angle, one obtains the total cross-section:\n\u03c3(\u03bb,M) = (GM)2T (\u03bb,M), (3.8)\nwhere\nT (\u03bb,M) \u2261 1 8 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03d5 \u222b \u03b2max \u03b2min(\u03bb) d\u03b2 sin\u03b2 1 + 6 cos2 \u03b2 + cos4 \u03b2 sin4 \u03b2/2 .

            "text": "In the quasi-classical limit, the general approach to describe the evolution of the SGWB, travelling across the LSS of the universe, passes through the graviton Wigner function, i.e. the graviton phase-space distribution function, f(x\u00b5, p\u00b5), where x\u00b5 denotes the spacetime coordinates, p\u00b5 = dx\u00b5/d\u03bb is the four-momentum, and \u03bb is an affine parameter along the graviton trajectories. This distribution function follows the Boltzmann equation (e.g. [36\u2013 38]):\nL[f ] = C[f ] + J [f ], (4.1)\nwhere L = d/d\u03bb is the Liouville operator, C[f ] is the collision term representing the interaction between GW and massive objects, and J [f ] is a source term due to emission processes from astrophysical and cosmological GW sources. Here, we are interested in evaluating, in the Born approximation, C[f ] which contributes both to the SGWB intensity and polarisation, while we ignore the contribution from the emissivity term, J [f ] [1, 37], and possible effects of graviton scattering with other particles (see e.g. [38, 78]). The approach followed in this work is based on the analogy with the standard treatment of CMB anisotropies [46, 47, 50]. In particular, we use the fact that, in the photon propagation description, the vector radiative transfer equation (VRTE) - which describes the rate of change of the Stokes parameters - is formally equivalent to the Boltzmann equations for CMB intensity and polarisation (see e.g. [49]). We apply the same treatment to the GW Stokes parameters defined via the density matrix in Eq. (2.2), for which, as the system becomes classical, f(x\u00b5, p\u00b5) can be interpreted as its Wigner transform. We therefore consider the GWs Stokes vector ~S = (I, Q + iU, Q \u2212 iU, V )T and write the Boltzmann equation as [46\u201348]\nd~S d\u03b7\n= \u03c4\u0307(\u03b7) [ ~F [ ~S ] \u2212 ~S ] , (4.2)\nwhere \u03b7 is the conformal time, ~F [ ~S ] is the flux of the outgoing radiation, and \u03c4(\u03b7) defines the \"optical\" thickness, in this case due to graviton scattering, of the medium through which the gravitational radiation is propagating. The dot indicates derivative with respect to \u03b7. In\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nthe case of gravitational waves incoming over a distribution of massive objects, the optical thickness is given by [1]:\n\u03c4(\u03b7) = \u222b \u03b70 \u03b7 nph(\u03b7 \u2032)\u03c3(\u03b7\u2032, \u03bb,M)a(\u03b7\u2032)d\u03b7\u2032 , (4.3)\nfor an initial conformal time \u03b70. In the above equation, nph(\u03b7) is the physical density of massive objects which incoming GWs are scattered off at a given epoch \u03b7, a(\u03b7) is the scale factor of the universe, and \u03c3 is the total cross-section of Eq. (3.8). Note that here we work in a simplified scenario of incoherent scattering [1] assuming all the massive scatters to have the same massM . In principle, one could refine this approximation by integrating, over reasonable mass ranges, the R.H.S of Eq. (4.2) times a weighting function f(M) that describes the mass distribution of the objects. However, as we will see in Sec. 5, this will not affect the overall results of our analysis. After scattering, the outgoing radiation is given by:\n~F [ ~S ] = 1\nT\n\u222b d\u2126\u2032M(n\u2032,n)~S(n\u2032), (4.4)\nwith n\u2032 and n the incident and outgoing directions, respectively. All the physics of the scattering process is described by the scattering matrix,M, which connects the incoming and the outgoing Stokes vectors.

A quick inspection of the null terms in the structure of M reveals that the circular polarisation is not generated by the gravitational\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nCompton scattering for an incident SGWB background without an initial circular polarisation; this is a feature in common with Thomson scattering between electrons and CMB photons [1, 49, 55, 56]. However, we highlight here three crucial differences with the CMB Thomson scattering process:\n\u2022 First, the gravitational Compton scattering matrix is characterised by the presence of the overall factor (1\u2212 n \u00b7 n\u2032)\u22122 coming from the Rutherford\u2019s type denominator of the cross-section, Eq. (3.1), which complicates the angular dependence as compared to the CMB case.\n\u2022 Second, the presence of SWSH of order 4 inM(n,n\u2032) is expected since Q\u00b1iU transform under rotations as spin-4 quantities, thus they have to be decomposed in terms of spin-4 weighted spherical harmonics:\n(Q\u00b1 iU)(n) = \u2211 `,m a\u00b14`m\u00b14Y`,m(n) . (4.7)\nInstead, in the photon case, the linear polarisations are spin-2 quantities (see e.g. [48]), thus the CMB scattering matrix contains SWSH of s \u00b1 2 [46]. This is related to the nature of the propagating field (spin-1 in the case of photons and spin-2 in the case of gravitons).\n\u2022 Third, in P(4)m (n,n\u2032) we see terms of order ` = 4 (hexadecapole) in scalar and spinweighted spherical harmonics (instead of the quadrupole, ` = 2, that characterises CMB Thomson scattering); this is a consequence of the spin-0 nature of the intensity, I, and, again, the spin-4 nature of the polarisation, Q\u00b1 iU , in the graviton case."

(4.5), into the Boltzmann equation (4.2), and expand it to first order in terms of graviton energy and polarisation vectors8 to obtain the evolution equation of the gravitational Stokes parameters in an inhomogeneous universe. For the sake of simplicity, in the LHS (Liouville part) of the Boltzmann equations (4.2) we consider only linear scalar metric perturbations over a flat FLRW background and neglect possible tensor metric perturbations, in order to avoid double counting (unless separated in distinct frequency ranges such that the geometrical optics limit still holds) the tensor perturbations in the SGWB described by the phase-space distribution function, f(x\u00b5, p\u00b5), travelling on top of the perturbed background. In the conformal Newtonian gauge, the line element reads:\nds2 = a2(\u03b7)[(1 + 2\u03a8)d\u03b72 \u2212 (1\u2212 2\u03a6)\u03b4ijdxidxj ] , (4.8)\nwhere \u03a8 and \u03a6 are 1 and functions of the spacetime.

Therefore, the graviton ensemble described by the density matrix perturbed at first order in energy and polarisation vectors can represent GWs beyond the linear regime in terms of the standard theory of cosmological perturbations.\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nwhere, q = a|p| is the comoving momentum modulus, \u03c1(0)ij represents the uniform and unpolarised GW density matrix such that \u03c1(0)11 = \u03c1 (0) 22 , \u03c1 (0) 12 = \u03c1 (0) 21 = 0, and \u03c1 (1) ij = \u03c1 (1) ji is the linear perturbation of Eq.

In Section 6 we explicitly recall the full dependence when needed. The above quantities represents linear order fluctuations in the Stokes parameters conveniently scaled by the energy density of the background graviton distribution. To obtain the perturbed R.H.S of the SGWB Boltzmann equation, Eq. (4.2), we substitute Eq. (4.5) into Eq. (4.4) and perturb the Stokes vector, ~S, at linear order in terms of the quantities defined in Eq. (4.10).

Note that the integrals are not evaluated on the whole solid angle, but they are limited by the restriction given by the cutoff \u03b2min < \u03b2 < \u03b2max. Finally, to obtain the full set of linear Boltzmann equations for GWs, we consider Eq. (4.8) and expand, up to first order in the scalar metric perturbations, the L.H.S of Eq. (4.2), obtaining the usual Liouville-like term as for the CMB photon distribution function9 (e.g. [37, 46, 50, 80]). We recall here we are working under two different assumptions: the geometrical optics limit, i.e. GW wavelengths being much smaller than the typical spatial scale on which linear metric\n9In this treatment we are neglecting first order corrections to the cross-section due to bulk velocities of the massive objects and to their angular momentum (see e.g. [53]).\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nperturbations vary, and the Born approximation, i.e. the mean free path of gravitons scattered off by massive objects being much larger than the scattering length. Finally, the final set of linear Boltzmann equations for the gravitational Stokes parameters of the astrophysical SGWB read as\nIntensity equation:\n(\u2202\u03b7 + n i\u2202i)\u2206I(n)\u2212 4 [ \u03a6\u0307\u2212 ni\u2202i\u03a8 ] =\u2212 a\u03c3nph [ \u2206I(n)\u2212 I(0)(n)\u2212 2\u2211 m=\u22122 Y2m(n)I(2)m (n)\u2212 4\u2211 m=\u22124 Y4m(n)\u00d7\n( I(4)m (n) + \u221a 35\n2 L(4)+m (n) +\n\u221a 35\n2 L(4)\u2212m (n) )] (4.12)\nLinear polarisation equation:\n(\u2202\u03b7 + n i\u2202i)\u2206Q\u00b1iU (n) = \u2212a\u03c3nph [ \u2206Q\u00b1iU (n)\u2212 \u22114 m=\u22124 \u00b14Y4m(n) (\u221a 70I(4)m (n) + 35L(4)+m (n) + 35L(4)\u2212m (n) )] (4.13) Circular polarisation equation:\n(\u2202\u03b7 + n i\u2202i)\u2206V (n) = \u2212a\u03c3nph [ \u2206V (n)\u2212 \u22111 m=\u22121 Y1m(n)V (1) m (n)\u2212 \u22113 m=\u22123 Y3m(n)V (3) m (n) ] (4.14) Here we have exploited the fact that the solution of Eq.(4.2) at zeroth order in perturbation theory is simply the background uniform unpolarised density matrix, i.e. the redshifted intensity, \u03c1(0)11 = \u03c1 (0) 22 , associated to the monopole of the SGWB. This cancels out between the L.H.S and R.H.S of Eqs. (4.12)-(4.14). This system of coupled equations appears rather complicated due to the scattering terms in the R.H.S which include SWSH with s = \u00b14 and ` \u2264 4, plus the Rutherford\u2019s type factor hidden in the integrals of Eq. (4.11). However, a direct inspection of Eqs. (4.12)-(4.14) reveals some interesting physical features, as described below."

The coefficients a\u0303`,m are related to the a`,m in a generic direction as (e.g. [81]):\na\u0303`,m = \u2211\u0300 m\u2032=\u2212` (D\u2217)`m\u2032,m[R(\u0398,\u03a6)]a`,m\u2032 . (5.2)\nIn Eq. (5.2), the quantities (D\u2217)`m\u2032,m[R(\u0398,\u03a6)] represent the (complex-conjugate) elements of the Wigner-D matrix (e.g. [82]), connecting a frame to another one obtained by rotating the former by an angle \u03a6 along the z-axis and an angle \u0398 along the y-axis.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nIn the z-alinged frame, the scattered intensity I\u0303 and linear polarisations Q\u0303\u00b1 iU\u0303 are given by (see Eq. (B.4) and e.g. [1]):\nI\u0303 = (GM)2 \u222b d\u2126I\u0303 \u2032(\u03b2, \u03b3) 1 + 6 cos2 \u03b2 + cos4 \u03b2\n2 sin4(\u03b2/2) , (5.3)\nQ\u0303\u00b1 iU\u0303 = (GM)2 \u222b d\u2126I\u0303 \u2032(\u03b2, \u03b3) sin4 \u03b2\n2 sin4(\u03b2/2) e\u22134i\u03b3 . (5.4)\nThe V\u0303 Stokes parameter remains everywhere zero if the incoming radiation is initially circularly unpolarised. Note that, each multipole, `, withm 6= 0 in I \u2032(\u03b2, \u03b3) gives a null contribution to Eq. (5.3), as the integral over \u03b3 vanishes. In Thomson scattering for photons, regardless of the anisotropies of the incident radiation, only the monopole ` = 0 and the quadrupole ` = 2 are affected by the process, while the other multipoles integrate to zero via the orthogonality of spherical harmonics (thus, they remain unchanged with respect to the incident field). However, we stress here this is no more true for the gravitational Stokes parameters, since the Rutherford\u2019s type divergence, sin\u22124 \u03b2, causes all the incoming multipoles (withm = 0) to be scattered, therefore producing outgoing anisotropies of any order ` if they are present in input. Regarding Q\u0303\u00b1 iU\u0303 , the factor exp[\u00b1i4\u03b3] makes the integral in Eq. (5.4) identically zero unless incident radiation has a non-vanishing m = \u00b14 components, which implies ` \u2265 4: at least an hexadecapole anisotropy is needed to generate polarisation form an initially unpolarised radiation. We now estimate the order of magnitude of the R.H.S. of Eqs. (4.12)\u2013(4.13), by evaluating the cross-section and the expected comoving density of the scattering targets. Given an observed wavelength, only objects for which the condition Eq. (3.7) holds contribute to the scattering. For Stellar mass Black Holes (StBH) with typical masses M \u223c 10M , the wavelengths involved satisfy \u03bbobs & 10\u221212 pc, where, in Eq. (3.7), we have assumed that the scattering happens at an average redshift z = 1. This means that the contribution of StBH ideally affects the observations of all current and upcoming surveys. We consider \u03bbobs = 10\n\u221210 pc, which is inside the LIGO/VIRGO band (see Tab. 1). From Eq. (3.8), the total cross-section is \u03c3(\u03bbobs, 10M ) = 1.47\u00d7 10\u221220 pc2. (5.5) Following e.g. [1, 83], we estimate the number density of StBH in the local universe to be nph = nBH \u223c 2.4\u00d7 10\u221214 pc\u22123; this implies that the overall pre-factor multiplying the R.H.S. of Eqs. (4.12)\u2013(4.13) is extremely small, as one can visually inspect in Fig. 1, where we show the full-sky maps for the outgoing Iout and (Q \u00b1 iU)out Stokes parameters10, as listed in the fourth and fifth columns of Tab. 2. The incident radiation (top left panel of Fig. 1) is assumed to be unpolarised and given by a pure intensity hexadecapole, ` = 4 with m = 0, of order-unity:\nIin(\u03b8, \u03c6) = Y4,0(\u03b8, \u03c6) = 3\n16 \u221a \u03c0 (35 cos4 \u03b8 \u2212 30 cos2 \u03b8 + 3),\n(Q\u00b1 iU)in(\u03b8, \u03c6) = 0,\nwhere (\u03b8, \u03c6) indicate the angles at which the incoming radiation is observed in the laboratory frame.\n10We generally refer to \u201coutgoing\u201d radiation as the total contribution in the R.H.S. of Eqs. (4.12)-(4.14), i.e. with the incoming radiation subtracted.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nAssuming a value of unity for the incoming intensity, the order-of-magnitude of the collision term is \u223c 10\u221233 for the intensity and \u223c 10\u221238 for the linear polarisations. Thus, as expected, the collision term due to GWs Compton scattering off of massive objects appears to provide a very small contribution to the R.H.S of Boltzmann equations for gravitons, at least when the scattering is sourced by stellar mass BH. An order-of-magnitude estimate of the polarisation produced by scattering off of various astrophysical objects can be found in Ref. [1], where it is shown that the SGWB polarisation produced by massive scatters is smaller by several orders of magnitude than the intensity anisotropies, for almost all frequency bands of ongoing and upcoming detectors. Nonetheless, we remark that in this work we are not only interested in the total polarisation as in Ref. [1], but rather we focus on the presentation of the system of coupled Boltzmann equations for SGWB intensity and polarisation anisotropies, which provides a way to estimate the correct, albeit very small, interplay between the two. Note that an azimuthally-symmetric (i.e. independent of \u03c6) incoming SGWB field with an hexadecapole intensity anisotropy will generate a polarisation in the plane between the incoming and outgoing directions which is real (U = 0) and proportional to sin4 \u0398, as one can directly verify by using the definitions of the Wigner-D symbols, and then computing the integrals of Eqs. (5.3)-(5.4). This differs from the electromagnetic case, where only a quadrupole intensity anisotropy is needed to generate linear polarisation via Thomson scattering. It is important to stress that the integrals of Eq. (5.3) and Eq. (5.4) are limited by the cutoff \u03b2min \u221d \u03bb\u22122/3obs . Thus, the larger is the wavelength considered in the scattering process, the smaller is the value of \u03b2min. In Tab. 2 we list the values of the optical depth and the corresponding order-of-magnitude values of the collision term for intensity and polarisation at\n\u2013 12 \u2013\ndifferent \u03bbobs, generated from scattering of order-unity unpolarised incoming radiation. For all the wavelengths, we have considered GW collisions with a population of stellar mass BHs with M = 10M at z \u223c 1. Moreover, it is worth noticing that a decrease in \u03b2min does not make the scattered polarisation, Eq. (5.4), to diverge, as the integral converges for \u03b2 \u2192 0 (the limit of the ratio sin4 \u03b2/ sin4(\u03b2/2) in the integrand is finite and equal to 16 for \u03b2 \u2192 0). However, Eq. (5.3) is divergent for small scattering angles, which means that the collisional term in Eq. (4.12) grows with increasing \u03bb. Note that a full numerical solution of the system of coupled SGWB Boltzmann Eqs. (4.12)\u2013 (4.14), would be needed to provide an accurate estimate of the total amount of polarisation generated by multiple scattering processes off of massive objects, as well as its interplay with intensity anisotropies, during the SGWB propagation across the LSS of the universe; this however is beyond the purpose of this paper. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to solve the set of equations in a simplified scenario. In the next Section, we provide analytical expressions for the angular power spectrum of intensity and polarisation perturbations, assuming unpolarised incoming radiation scattered off a uniform distribution of targets located in a small redshift interval."

As in the collisionless case (e.g. [37] for the case of intenisties anisotropies alone) we can write the formal solution of the Boltzmann equations as:\n\u2206I(\u03b70) = [\u2206I(\u03b7in) + 4\u03a8(\u03b7in)] e ik\u00b5(\u03b7in\u2212\u03b70)\u2212\u03c4(\u03b7in)+\n+ \u222b \u03b70 \u03b7in d\u03b7eik\u00b5(\u03b7\u2212\u03b70)\u2212\u03c4(\u03b7) [ 4(\u03a6\u0307 + \u03a8\u0307)\u2212 \u03c4\u0307(4\u03a8 + CI) ] \u2212 4\u03a8(\u03b70) ,\n(6.3)\n\u2206Q\u00b1iU (\u03b70) = \u2206Q\u00b1iU (\u03b7in)e ik\u00b5(\u03b7in\u2212\u03b70)\u2212\u03c4(\u03b7in) \u2212 \u222b \u03b70 \u03b7in d\u03b7eik\u00b5(\u03b7\u2212\u03b70)\u2212\u03c4(\u03b7)\u03c4\u0307CQ\u00b1iU . (6.4)\nIn both equations we have used the fact that the optical depth in Eq. (4.3) is zero at \u03b70 by definition. The first terms in the RHS carry the information about initial conditions, weighted by the exponential of the optical depth. We now assume that the initial net polarisation anisotropy of the incoming radiation at \u03b7in is zero, i.e. the two terms depending on L(4)\u00b1m in CI and CQ\u00b1iU are zero, as well as the term \u2206Q\u00b1iU (\u03b7in) in Eq. (6.4). The function g(\u03b7) = \u03c4\u0307(\u03b7) exp[\u2212\u03c4(\u03b7)] is called visibility function and its integral from \u03b7in to \u03b70 gives the probability that a GW is scattered by massive objects between the initial and present times (see [1]). We now consider a simplified case in which the scattering targets are well localised in a small redshift interval [zmin, zmax], such that the visibility function is non-vanishing only if \u03b7 \u2208 [\u03b7(zmax), \u03b7(zmin)]. We can therefore assume that all the other quantities do not change significantly in that time interval and evaluate them at \u03b7\u2217 = \u03b7(zmax). In this way, since for \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) 1 (see Tab. 1) one has:\u222b \u03b70\n\u03b7in g(\u03b7)d\u03b7 ' \u222b \u03b70 \u03b7\u2217 g(\u03b7)d\u03b7 = 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) ' \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) 1 + \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) ,\nthe integrals in the RHS of Eqs. (6.3)-(6.4) become respectively:\n[4\u03a8(\u03b7\u2217) + CI(\u03b7\u2217)] \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) 1 + \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) eik\u00b5(\u03b7\u2217\u2212\u03b70) + \u222b \u03b70 \u03b7in d\u03b7eik\u00b5(\u03b7\u2212\u03b70)\u2212\u03c4(\u03b7)4(\u03a6\u0307 + \u03a8\u0307) , (6.5)\nCQ\u00b1iU (\u03b7\u2217) \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) 1 + \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) eik\u00b5(\u03b7\u2217\u2212\u03b70) . (6.6)\nBy decomposing the incoming intensity in spherical harmonics\n\u2206I(\u03b7\u2217,k,n, q) = \u2211 ` \u2211\u0300 m=\u2212` \u2206I,`m(\u03b7\u2217,k, q)Y`m(n) ,\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nand using the properties under rotations of Eq. (5.2) to compute the integrals over the incoming directions in a frame aligned along the z-axis, we can rewrite the collision terms CI(\u03b7\u2217), CQ\u00b1iU (\u03b7\u2217) in Eqs. (6.5)-(6.6) in a more useful form:\nCI(\u03b7\u2217,k,n, q) = 1\nT \u221e\u2211 `=0 \u2211\u0300 m=\u2212` \u2206I,`m(\u03b7\u2217,k, q)Y`m(n)K` , (6.7)\nCQ\u00b1iU (\u03b7\u2217,k,n, q) = 16 \u221a 2\n35\n1\nT \u221e\u2211 `=0 \u2211\u0300 m=\u2212` \u2206I,`m(\u03b7\u2217,k, q)\u00b14Y`m(n)K\u22134` , (6.8)\nwhere we have defined K` = 4\u03c0 \u222b cos(\u03b2min) cos(\u03b2max)\ndx\n(1\u2212 x)2 (1 + 6x2 + x4)P`(x) ,\nK\u22134` = 2\u03c0(8!) \u22131/2 \u222b cos(\u03b2min) cos(\u03b2max)\ndx\n(1\u2212 x)2 \u221a (`\u00b1 4)!

P\u22134` (x)P \u00b14 4 (x) .\nHere, \u03b2min and \u03b2max represent the cut off range as defined in Sec. 4.1, Pl(x) and P\u00b14l (x) are the Legendre and associated Legendre polynomials, respectively, and using their properties it is possible to show that K+4` = K \u22124 ` \u2261 K (4) ` . For the sake of simplicity, we now neglect the scalar perturbations of the metric in the time interval [\u03b7in, \u03b70] as in this toy model we are interested in estimating the contribution, to the intensity and polarisation angular power spectra observed today, of the collision terms alone. Moreover, we assume that the initial distribution of perturbations in the SGWB intensity \u2206I(\u03b7in) is statistically isotropic, \u2206I(\u03b7in, q,k,n) = \u2206I(\u03b7in, q,k), i.e. it is represented by a monopole at the initial time \u03b7in, such that different moments measured by the observer at \u03b70 comes only from projection effects. We introduce the two-point correlation function of the initial intensity anisotropy in Fourier space as (e.g. [37])\n\u3008\u2206I(\u03b7in, q,k)\u2206\u2217I(\u03b7in, q,k\u2032)\u3009 = 2\u03c02\nk3 PI,in(q, k)(2\u03c0)\n3\u03b4(3)(k\u2212 k\u2032) , (6.9)\nwith PI,in(q, k) the initial power spectrum, carrying out information about the physical processes generating the SGWB. The intensity angular power spectrum observed today at the spacetime point (\u03b70,x0) is then obtained by decomposing the RHS of Eqs.

The expression of C`,I and C`,Q\u00b1iU are quite cumbersome, even in the simplified scenario considered. In both Eqs. (6.12)-(6.13), the summed indices `1, `3 come from the incoming intensity monopole at \u03b7in which is scattered at \u03b7\u2217 and projected to (\u03b70,x0), while `2, `4 are related to the outgoing radiation freely propagating from \u03b7\u2217 and observed at \u03b70. The sums are further regulated by the selection rules of the Wigner 3j symbols. The terms between square brackets which multiply the integral over k encapsulate the effect of collisions. More in details, Eq. (6.12) can be seen as the sum of three contributions, C`,I = C in `,I + C S `,I + 2C in,S `,I , related to the three terms in square brackets. The first term, multiplied by the exponential exp[\u22122\u03c4(\u03b7in)], refers to the initial radiation propagating without being scattered, the second term is the contribution to the intensity power spectrum from SGWB scattering at \u03b7\u2217, while the last term represents the cross correlation between the two. Considering a single multipole at a time at \u03b7\u2217 , `1 = `3 = L, it is easy to evaluate the fractional overall contribution from GW Compton scattering with respect to the unscattered radiation in the angular power spectrum:\n\u03b4C (L) coll,I = ( CI \u2212 C inI C inI )(L) = [( \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) 1 + \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) )2 K2L T 2 + 2 T \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) 1 + \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217) e\u2212\u03c4(\u03b7in)KL ] e2\u03c4(\u03b7in) . (6.14)\nWe remark here that all the terms in Eq. (6.14) implicitly depend on the GW frequency (wavelength) through the Rutherford-divergent cross section \u03c3(\u03bb,M), as already pointed out in the previous sections.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nIn the left panel of Fig. 2, we show \u03b4C(L)coll,I as a function of the first 15 multipoles, for the case of a uniform distribution of stellar-mass black holes at z\u2217 = 1.0 with M = 10M and \u03bbobs = 10\n\u221210 pc. As expected, the contribution of the GW Compton scattering to the intensity angular power spectrum is extremely small. Moreover it drops rapidly when going to higher multipoles. We also observe that \u03b4C(L)coll,I is dominated by the second term which arises from cross correlation between the incoming and scattered radiation. The structure of Eq. (6.13) is very similar to Eq. (6.12), except for the presence of the three j symbols with m1,m2 = \u00b14. This is related to the spin 4-nature of Q \u00b1 iU and makes the term identically zero for `i < 4, i = 1..4, as expected. The term in the square brackets of Eq. (6.13):\nS`1,`3 = 512\n35\n1\nT 2 \u00d7\n[( \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217)\n1 + \u03c4(\u03b7\u2217)\n)2 K(4)`1 K (4) `3 ] (6.15)\nrepresents the order of magnitude of the polarisation generated by GW Compton scattering by massive objects. We can proceed as above and evaluate the contribution to the angular power spectrum for a single multipole, L, at a time. In the right panel of Fig. 2 we show the value of SL,L of Q\u00b1 iU for L = 4, ...15, confirming that the amount of polarisation generated during a single scattering process is very small for wavelengths in the LIGO-VIRGO band, as already found in [1] using a different approach. However, we stress here that the calculations presented in this section neglect scalar metric perturbations and their time derivative which affect the SGWB free-streaming from \u03b7\u2217 to \u03b70. On the one hand, as pointed out in the literature (see e.g. [17]), metric perturbations produce intensity anisotropies of an even isotropic SGWB component. In turn, such intensity anisoptropies, changing in amplitude due to propagation on a perturbed background, enter the RHS of the coupled Boltzmann equations for intensity and polarisation, causing, at least via the change of PI,in(q, k) during GW free-streaming among different collisions (but also with the generation of the L(4)\u00b1m terms), the change of the RHS in Eqs. (6.12)-(6.13), and therefore of the observed intensity and polarisation power spectra. On the other hand, despite we have worked with several simplifications, the formalism we developed here is completely general and independent of the initial conditions Pin(q, k). Therefore our computation could be extended to the case of an angular-dependent initial intensity perturbation and to polarised incoming radiation. In principle, via our approach, one could also estimate the contribution of multiple scattering episodes by considering a series of independent collisions happening at different fixed redshift zi and assuming that the SGWB evolves freely between zi and zi+1."

            "heading": "7 Conclusions",
            "text": "In this paper we have provided, for the first time to date, a system of coupled Boltzmann equations describing the intensity and polarisation Stokes parameters of the astrophysical SGWB, including collision terms which account for gravitational Compton scattering off of massive objects. In analogy with Thomson scattering in the electromagnetic case, we have computed the full scattering matrix, Eq. (4.5), appearing in the collision term of the graviton Boltzmann equations in the low-energy limit of the graviton-scalar cross-section. The final set of equations, Eqs. (4.12)-(4.14), resembles that for the CMB Stokes parameters [46, 49, 50]; however, the different spin nature of the radiation and the physics involved in the scattering process determine crucial differences between photon and graviton stochastic backgrounds.\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nIn particular, while photon Thomson scattering affects only anisotropies in the intensity of the incoming radiation with ` = 0, 2, due to orthogonality of spherical harmonics, in the case of gravitational Compton scattering with massive objects the Rutherford\u2019s type term, sin\u22124 \u03b2, makes all multipoles (with m = 0) to be scattered out, therefore producing outgoing anisotropies of any order ` if they are present in the intensity of the incident GW field. Linear polarisation can be generated from unpolarised anisotropic radiation only with m = \u00b14, which requires at least an hexadecapole anisotropy (` \u2265 4) in the incoming intensity; this is again a consequence of the fact that Q\u00b1 iU is a spin-4 quantity in the case of gravitons. We have further provided an analytic solution for the angular power spectrum of intensity and polarisation anisotropies when the scattering targets are located in a small redshift range, under the assumption of unpolarised incoming monopole radiation and neglecting free-streaming effects due to metric scalar perturbations We explicitly computed the order of magnitude of the contribution of SGWB Compton scattering by massive objects to the intensity and polarisation power spectra as a function of the projected multipoles moments of the incoming radiation. Our analysis confirms that the contribution of the gravitational Compton scattering to SGWB anisotropies is extremely small for collisions with massive compact objects (BH and SMBH) in the frequency range of current and upcoming surveys, as already found in previous studies with different methods [1]. This statement can be extended to other massive scatters as main sequence stars. However, in our simplified estimation of such contribution, we completely neglected effects sourced by the generation of further intensity and polarisation anisotropies during GW propagation on a perturbed FLRW background, which in turn enter the collision term in the RHS of the Boltzmann equations. In conclusion, it is important to stress that the focus of this work relies on the set of coupled Boltzmann equations for SGWB intensity and polarisation Stokes parameters, which we present here for the first time in the literature. Beyond the simplified model described above, a full numerical integration of the coupled Eqs. (4.12)\u2013(4.14) would provide a more accurate\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nestimate of the total amount of anisotropies generated by multiple scattering processes off of massive objects, as well as the interplay between polarisation and intensity (including a polarised incoming background), during the SGWB propagation across the LSS of the universe. This will be investigated in future works."
