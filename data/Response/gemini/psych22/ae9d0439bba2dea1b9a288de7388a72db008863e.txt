1. **Investigate the relationship between personality traits and the efficacy of robot-mediated mental health interventions.** This study found that students' neuroticism and conscientiousness traits were associated with their response to the robot intervention. Future research could explore this relationship in more detail, examining how different personality traits may affect the effectiveness of different types of robot-mediated mental health interventions.


2. **Develop adaptive robot-mediated mental health interventions that can tailor their content and delivery to individual users' personality traits and behavioral cues.** The results of this study suggest that robot-mediated mental health interventions could be more effective if they are tailored to individual users' personality traits and behavioral cues. Future research could develop and evaluate adaptive robot-mediated mental health interventions that can adjust their content and delivery in real time based on these factors.


3. **Explore the use of robot-mediated mental health interventions to support students' adherence to long-term therapy.** This study found that students' working alliance with the robot was associated with their motivation to change their behavior for better well-being. Future research could explore the use of robot-mediated mental health interventions to support students' adherence to long-term therapy, examining whether the robot can help to build and maintain a strong working alliance between the student and the therapist.


4. **Investigate the impact of robot-mediated mental health interventions on students' academic performance and overall well-being.** This study focused on the impact of the robot intervention on students' psychological well-being, mood, and readiness to change behavior for better well-being. Future research could investigate the impact of robot-mediated mental health interventions on students' academic performance and overall well-being, examining whether the robot can help to improve students' grades, reduce their stress levels, and increase their overall sense of happiness and fulfillment.


5. **Conduct a longitudinal study to examine the long-term effects of robot-mediated mental health interventions.** This study was a short-term feasibility study, and it is unclear whether the effects of the robot intervention would be sustained over time. Future research could conduct a longitudinal study to examine the long-term effects of robot-mediated mental health interventions, following participants for a period of months or years to see whether the robot can help to maintain or improve their mental health over time.
