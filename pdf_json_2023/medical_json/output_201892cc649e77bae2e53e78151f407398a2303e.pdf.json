In Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) it has been proposed as a possible biomarker of activity and severity, however; in the field of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) the role of YKL\u201140 in IIM is not clear. Thus, we aimed to evaluate if there is an association between the serum levels and muscle tissue expression of YKL\u201140 with age, IIM phenotype, muscle strength and myositis disease activity. The main finding was that age is the most important variable that affects the YKL\u201140 serum levels. In muscle biopsy, we observed that YKL\u201140 is mainly expressed in infiltrating lymphoid cells than in muscle tissue. Using ANCOVA according to the b\u2011coefficients, YKL\u201140 serum levels are predicted by inflammatory state, age, and IIM diagnosis.\nYKL-40, also known as human cartilage glycoprotein 39 or chitinase-3 like protein 1, contains highly conserved chitin-binding domains. It lacks chitinase or hydrolase activity due to the exchange of a glutamic acid residue for leucine in the chitinase-3-like catalytic domain1. Although the study of this protein began two decades ago, normal serum values vary among the healthy population worldwide. A pivotal YKL-40 study reported that the mean concentration in sera was 43\u00a0\u00b5g/L in HI between 7 to 45\u00a0years old and remains stable for at least 10\u00a0years.

Its function is related to tissue remodeling and/or systemic inflammation. Evidence has pointed out a role as a possible biomarker of activity and severity in some autoimmune rheumatic diseases, mainly rheumatoid arthritis (RA)6\u201310.\nIn the field of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), also known as myositis, the role of YKL-40 in the establishment of the IIM is not clear, few studies have reported a possible association. Elevated YKL-40 expression was found in alveolar macrophages from patients with dermatomyositis /polymyositis (DM/PM) and interstitial lung disease (ILD)11. In DM, one of the main histological characteristics, is the complement-mediated microangiopathy that might be related to endothelial damage and YKL-40 expression12. In anti-synthetase syndrome (ASyS) YKL-40 expression correlates with TNF-\u03b1 concentration, arguing that the main source of YKL-40 is the muscle infiltration of inflammatory cells9,13.\nOur aim was to evaluate if there is an association between the serum levels and muscle tissue expression of YKL-40 with clinical variables such age, IIM phenotype14, muscle strength trough Manual Muscle Testing 8 (MMT8)15, the clinical activity and disease damage using the myositis disease activity assessment (MYOACT) and muscle damage index (MDI), respectively16."

To confirm that YKL40 serum levels are influenced by disease process, we compared all study groups: IIM, RA and HI. The most important finding was the difference in IIM against RA (Fig.\u00a01). The clinical features of each IIM patient are shown in Table\u00a02.\nYKL\u201140 serum levels in IIM are associated with age, but not with disease duration To assess which variables can determinate higher YKL-40 serum levels in IIM, we evaluated the correlation between YKL-40 serum levels and clinical variables (Supplementary Table\u00a01). We found that age is most important variable that affects the YKL-40 serum levels but not the duration of disease in IIM (Fig.\u00a02a).\nPredictive value of in CRP, age and diagnosis on serum levels of YKL\u201140 To evaluate the influence of inflammatory state (CRP), age and IIM diagnosis on YKL-40 serum levels, we analyze these variables by ANCOVA. According to the b-coefficients, YKL-40 serum levels were increased with inflammation, age and IIM diagnosis mainly (Table\u00a03). It is interesting to denote although the behavior of YKL-40 serum levels by decades is similar between both groups IIM patients shown higher levels at the same age (Fig.\u00a02b).\nYKL\u201140 expression in muscle tissue from IIM patients In addition to quantifying YKL-40 serum levels, we were able to obtain 17 muscle tissue samples from myositis patients, to evaluate YKL-40 in\u00a0situ protein expression. We rather observed YKL-40 expression in infiltrating lymphoid cells (11 patients, 61.1%) than muscle tissue (one patient, 5.6%), mainly in endomysium. The most representative images in decreased order of YKL-40 expression are shown in Fig.\u00a03a\u2013d.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:19172 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46491-4\nIn panel a, we show the only positive patient in muscle tissue. It is important to denote that this patient had the lowest MMT8 along the highest MYOACT and MDI scores.\nWe did not observe any association between YKL-40 protein expression and the presence of MSA/MAA or the clinical phenotype, however; we found that positives patients for YKL-40 expression in infiltrating lymphoid cells had higher CPK serum levels (506.4 \u00b1 763.70 vs 51.33 \u00b1 34.67, P = 0.020) as well as higher MYOACT score (0.1 \u00b1 0.11 vs 0.0 \u00b1 0.01, P = 0.023) (Fig.\u00a04).

            "text": "In this study, YKL-40 serum levels are influenced by factors such as age, inflammation, and diagnosis of autoimmune diseases (RA/MII)3. Currently, due to its participation in tissue remodeling and degradation, attempts have been made to use it as a biomarker in proinflammatory states as well as to be an indicator of poor prognosis in inflammatory diseases6,7. However, its usefulness is still controversial because the full biological effects are still unknown. Moreover, the specific factors that promote its expression as well as its interaction with the majority of the cytokines and molecules involved in the development and establishment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases are not well established17.\nIt has been described that YKL-40 serum levels are increased with age, in various cardiovascular, metabolic, and systemic inflammatory diseases3. Bojesen et\u00a0al. found that the serum values of YKL-40 increased exponentially with aging. In subjects with two YKL-40 measurements 10\u00a0years apart, the mean increase in YKL-40 was 1.5\u00a0\u03bcg/L/year18. Regarding inflammatory diseases, in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, increased serum levels of YKL-40 were reported, hypothesizing that might have a role to promote chemotaxis, tissue damage, and vascular injury19.\nIn RA, it has been recognized as a potential candidate autoantigen, additionally is produced, and secreted by monocytes differentiated into macrophages, articular chondrocytes, synovium, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and endothelium in these patients17,19,20. It has been proposed that the pathogenic mechanism of YKL-40 in RA initiates with its binding to HLA-DR4 peptide-binding motif promoting the mononuclear cells proliferation and HLA-DM plays a key role to presenting YKL-40 to CD4 + T cell. In addition, antigen presenting cells (APCs) present YKL-40 in sites where the RA is in early phase, indicating an association for YKL-40 in RA pathogenesis20\u201322. On the other hand, differentiated DR4 + dendritic cells and macrophages are similar to synovial joint APCs and have the potential to perform the MHC II-presentation of YKL-40 epitopes resulting in higher levels in synovial and serum21,22. Although the pathogenic mechanism in RA has been elucidated, the agents that promote the expression of YKL-40 in RA are still missing, it has been associated with the development of a chronic, destructive, relapsing arthritis due to its role in tissue remodeling and degradation. It is considered as an effective marker in estimating RA disease activities, prognostic value and may be a therapeutic target19.\nRegarding IIM, the information is even more limited because few studies have been carried out in this regard thus the role played by YKL-40 in this field has not yet been established. Regarding its proinflammatory action and relationship with diagnosis and phenotype of IIM, Noguchi et\u00a0al. found significantly elevated serum in patients with PM/DM compared to the healthy population, as well as age-corrected serum YKL-40 values were\nFigure\u00a01.

In muscle biopsies found infiltration of YKL-40-positive inflammatory cells (probably macrophages) in the endomysium and perimysium this suggest that cells other than CD8 + and CD4 + T cells may cause inflammation23.\nMing-Zhu Gao et\u00a0al. measured YKL-40 levels in patients with DM/PM, and HI and reported significantly higher levels in patients with IIM compared to the control group (51.6 vs 27.8\u00a0ng/mL, respectively)6.

On the other hand, Carboni et\u00a0al. analyzed YKL-40 serum levels and its expression in muscle tissues in patients with ASSD. However, YKL-40 serum levels did not correlate with other clinical, laboratory, disease status, or therapeutic parameters, moreover, YKL-40 was expressed by the inflammatory cells of the muscle tissue13. Our study strengthens these results with serum levels of 187.80\u00a0ng/mL in patients with IIM vs 46.82\u00a0ng/mL with RA and 57.17\u00a0ng/mL in HI as well as their presence mainly in inflammatory cells. This elevation could be explained by inflammation, macrophage activation, fibroblast destruction, and vascular changes present.\nAs mentioned earlier, several biological effects of YKL-40 are known such as inflammation and tissue remodeling as well as its main sources, highlighting its exacerbated expression in inflammatory diseases such RA or SLE, however; some researchers has pointed out that this expression can vary according disease type which could be due to the multiorgan damage in IIM compared with RA where the damage is directed against joints mainly19,24. Tang et\u00a0al. found that YKL-40 concentration was significantly higher in IIM patients with myocardial injury than without myocardial injury25.\nIn addition, YKL-40 has a role in cardiovascular diseases such as early atherosclerosis, essential hypertension, and other progressing vascular complications. In IIM patients as in many others autoimmune diseases the serum levels of this protein have a positive association, specifically with atherosclerosis and could predict both overall and cardiovascular mortality5,26,27.\nWe aimed to know if YKL-40 are influenced by some factors in IIM such as was mentioned by Tizaoui et\u00a0al., first, we compared some demographic, laboratory and clinical variables between patients with RA and IIM mentioned in Table\u00a01. Of all the variants analyzed, we found a significant difference in pDBP (P = 0.024) and pMBP (P = 0.035) being higher in IIM patients. This could be due to that blood vessels suffer damage in early stages of\nFigure\u00a03. Protein expression of YKL-40 in MII patients muscle samples evaluated by immunohistochemistry.

Moreover, the endothelial alterations in IIM develops into microangiopathy, causing blood pressure alterations12. Although information about how the process occurs precisely is scarce, it was pointed out that cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular risk are increasing the mortality in IIM patients, but this becomes controversial because recently one single-center cross-sectional study reported that CV risk factors in IIM patients are not significant compared to HI but they are in IIM when are associated with age, disease duration, duration of therapy and body composition, which could be related with our patients enrolled in our study25,30. Although these variables evaluated were significant between these two groups, the serum levels of YKL-40 were the most significant variable (P = 0.010), being higher in IIM than in RA patients (187.80\u00a0ng/mL vs 46.82\u00a0ng/mL, respectively).\nOnce we established that IIM presents higher serum levels of YKL-40 than RA, we investigated if YKL-40 serum levels were affected by age or disease duration. Our results show that only aging has a positive correlation with increased YKL-40 but no with disease duration. The reports carried out by Johansen in 2006 and Schultz 2010 demonstrated clearly that aging is predictive for increases YKL-40 in HI, but in our IIM patients the concentration of this protein are more elevated due to inflammation and multiorgan damage2,3.\nWe evaluated the predictive value of inflammatory state, age and diagnosis of IIM on serum levels of YKL-40 and elucidated that CRP has predictive value on YKL-40 serum levels in IIM patients (P = 0.038) which is according with a cross-sectional study and systematic review published by Cui and et. al. In addition, age and the IIM diagnosis (P = 0.008 and P = 0.001, respectively) showed to be powerful predictors on YKL-40 serum levels24. On the other hand, we confirmed that age and IIM diagnosis influences the YKL-40 concentration importantly because YKL-40 serum levels are the highest when are compared against control and RA groups allowing us to know that the presence of the disease or its type influence the YKL-40 concentration. Some reports refer that YKL-40 concentration in HI are stable for many years but increase with aging or inflammatory conditions. Other researchers reported that normal YKL-40 serum levels can be different among healthy population, therefore, they recommend that baseline values should be established for each study because in addition to environmental factors, the genetic load is other variable that can influence the pattern of expression of this protein26. We mentioned previously the pathogenic mechanism by which the expression of YKL-40 is mediated in RA and its possible role in IIM, but the information is not yet enough.\nRegarding the in-situ analysis of YKL-40 muscle expression, we observed YKL-40 is mainly expressed in inflammatory cells rather than muscle cells and we also observed YKL-40 expression is associated with higher CPK serum levels and MYOACT score that are commonly related to higher inflammation and muscle weakness. This observation is in accordance with the unique previous report of YKL-40 in muscle tissue made by Carboni et\u00a0al.13, thus, it supports its role in inflammation, as well as its function as a clinical marker of poor prognosis in inflammatory diseases.\nConsidering all our findings, we showed the expression of YKL-40 in HI as well as in patients with RA and IIM and the possible factors that could influence its expression."
