    "abstractText": "Mucin-domain glycoproteins are densely O-glycosylated and play critical roles in a host of biological functions. In particular, the T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing family of proteins (TIM-1, -3, -4) decorate immune cells and act as key regulators in cellular immunity. However, their dense O-glycosylation remains enigmatic, primarily due to the challenges associated with studying mucin domains. Here, we demonstrate that the mucinase SmE has a unique ability to cleave at residues bearing very complex glycans. SmE enables improvedmass spectrometric analysis of severalmucins, including the entire TIM family. With this information in-hand, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of TIM-3 and -4 to understand how glycosylation affects structural features of these proteins. Finally, we use these models to investigate the functional relevance of glycosylation for TIM-3 function and ligand binding. Overall, we present a powerful workflow to better understand the detailed molecular structures and functions of the mucinome.",

Malaker 1\nMucin-domain glycoproteins are densely O-glycosylated and play critical roles in a host of biological functions. In particular, the T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing family of proteins (TIM-1, -3, -4) decorate immune cells and act as key regulators in cellular immunity. However, their dense O-glycosylation remains enigmatic, primarily due to the challenges associated with studying mucin domains. Here, we demonstrate that the mucinase SmE has a unique ability to cleave at residues bearing very complex glycans. SmE enables improvedmass spectrometric analysis of severalmucins, including the entire TIM family. With this information in-hand, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of TIM-3 and -4 to understand how glycosylation affects structural features of these proteins. Finally, we use these models to investigate the functional relevance of glycosylation for TIM-3 function and ligand binding. Overall, we present a powerful workflow to better understand the detailed molecular structures and functions of the mucinome.\nMucin-domain glycoproteins are characterized by dense Oglycosylation that contributes to a unique, bottle-brush secondary structure that can extend away from the cell surface or form extracellular gel-like secretions1,2. Mucin-type O-glycans are characterized by an initiating \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) that can be further elaborated into several core structures containing sialic acid, fucose, and/or ABO blood group antigens. As a result, mucin domains serve as highly heterogeneous stretches of glycosylation that exert both biophysical and biochemical influences on the cellular milieu3,4. The canonical family of mucins, e.g. MUC2 and MUC16, bear massive mucin domains and are heavily implicated in various diseases5,6. That said, many other proteins contain mucin domains that do not reach that size or complexity but are nonetheless functionally important. Indeed, we recently introduced the human \u201cmucinome\u201d, which comprises hundreds of proteins thought to contain the dense O-glycosylation that is characteristic of mucin domains7.

C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-Inh) is a serine protease inhibitor, and a deficiency of this protein is associated with hereditary angioedema9. Finally, the T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein family (TIM-1, TIM-3 and TIM-4) are critical regulators of cellular immune responses and have substantial importance in immune-oncology10,11. Although considerable progress has beenmade in the biological and analytical analyses of these and other mucin-domain glycoproteins, much remains unknown regarding their glycan structures, glycosylation site-specificity, and functional roles within the cellular environment.\nThis gap in knowledge is due, in part, to the challenges associated with studying mucins by mass spectrometry (MS)12\u201314. Mucins present unique challenges at each stage of a typical MS workflow. One of the most well-documented issues is the resistance of densely O-glycosylated domains to trypsin digestion2,15,16. To address this challenge, several proteases have been introduced that selectively cleave at or near O-glycosylated residues thereby revolutionizing the field of O-glycoproteomics17\u201320. These enzymes are aptly named Oglycoproteases; those that prefer mucin-domain glycoproteins are often termed mucinases. The first of these enzymes, OgpA, was characterized as an O-glycoprotease that cleaves N-terminally to glycosylated Ser or Thr residues but is hindered by the presence of sialic acid19,21. We introduced StcE as a mucinase that selectively digests mucin domains with a cleavage motif of T/S*_X_T/S, wherein the asterisk indicates a mandatory glycosylation site; we subsequently developed a mucinase toolkit that displays a wide range of cleavage specificities17,18. More recently, ImpA was commercialized and, like OgpA, cleaves N-terminally to glycosylated Ser or Thr residues but, unlike OgpA, is less restricted by the glycans present22. While these enzymes have aided in the analysis of many O-glycoproteins and mucins, the use of each enzyme is accompanied by drawbacks. An ideal, broad-specificity O-glycoprotease conducive to MS analysis has not yet been characterized.\nAnother issue surrounding the characterization of mucin-domain glycoproteins is that typical structural biology techniques are not well suited for glycoproteins, let alone the dense glycosylation characteristic of mucin domains. As covered in our recent review, current knowledge regarding mucin secondary structure originates from various low-resolution images generated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM)2,23\u201325. While this has allowed us to definitively visualize the linearity of mucin protein backbones, by nature of the techniques,we areunable to (a) discern the individual glycans andhow they contribute to changes in protein structure or (b) observe the mucin protein dynamics2. More recently, many advances have been made in computational modeling of glycoproteins26. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have revealed some of the many roles that glycans play in the structure, stability, dynamics, and function of glycoproteins. Most notably, Amaro and colleagues revealed the functional role of the glycan shield in the activation mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein27,28. That said, while mucins have been subjected to MD simulations previously, they are often modeled with a static glycan structure, lack precise glycosylation information, and are simulated with coarse-grained MD. Taken together, for mucin-domain glycoproteins, we generally do not know the glycoproteomic landscape nor how the glycans work in concert to control protein and cellular dynamics.\nHere, we present a powerful technique to map the complex glycosylation within mucin domains and pair this information with MD simulations in order to better understand how glycans affect glycoprotein secondary structure and dynamics. We first introduce a mucinase, Serratia marcescens Enhancin (SmE), and demonstrate its\nunique ability to cleave at glycosites decorated by a myriad of glycans enabled enhanced glycosite and glycoform analysis by MS. With SmE in-hand, we then obtained complete O-glycoproteomic information for all TIM family proteins and demonstrated that TIM-3 has markedly fewer O-glycosites when compared to TIM-1 and -4. To better understand how these glycans affect overall protein structure, we then employed MD simulations and showed that TIM-3 has a much shorter persistence length and higher flexibility than TIM-4. Finally, we demonstrated lattice formation induced by galectin-9 (Gal-9) binding glycans on TIM-3 enhanced binding affinity/avidity for membranes containing PtdSer. Overall, this workflow aids in unraveling the complex molecular mechanisms behind mucin domains, their glycan patterns, and their contribution to cellular biology."

In particular, Serratia marcescens is a pervasive opportunistic pathogen in humans. This organism secretes a mucinase, SmE, that is a viral enhancin protein shown to promote arboviral infection of mosquitoes by degrading gut membrane-bound mucins29. SmE contains a catalytic domain belonging to the Pfam family PF13402 (peptidase M60, enhancin, and enhancin-like or M60like family) that is defined by a conserved HEXXH metallopeptidase motif30.We expressed SmEas a 94-kDa soluble, His-taggedprotein in E. coli at a high-yield expression level of 65mg/L (Supplementary Fig. 1). To determine SmE\u2019s mucin selectivity, we digested glycoproteins with and without mucin domains. SmE preferentially cleaved proteins with mucin domains\u2014C1-Inh, CD43, and TIM-1\u2014whereas it did not significantly cleave the non-mucin glycoproteins fibronectin and fetuin (Supplementary Fig. 2).\nAs in our previous work, we characterized SmE\u2019s cleavage motif using biologically relevantmucin-domain glycoproteins (C1-Inh, TIM-1, TIM-3, TIM-4, and GP1b\u03b1). These proteins were digested with SmE and subjected to MS analysis (Fig. 1A). Manually validated glycopeptides were mapped to protein sequences to identify sequence windows, which allowed the determination of minimum sequence motifs. As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, SmE cleaved N-terminally to a glycosylated Ser or Thr residue. SmE accommodated a variety of O-linked glycans at the P1\u2019 position (pie chart, right), including sialylated core 1 and core 2 O-linked glycans aswell as fucosylatedABObloodgroup antigens. SmE was also able to accommodate O-glycosylation at the P1 position (pie chart, left). Given the higher percentage of smaller O-glycan structures (GalNAc, GalNAc-Gal), it appears that the P1 O-glycosylation tolerance was less permissive at this position. However, these pie charts represent only site-localized glycan structures; site-localization at the C-terminus of the peptide is more challenging due to the lack of positive charge. Thus, the apparent preference for smaller glycan structures at the P1 position is likely due to issues in glycoproteomic analysis as opposed to an inability of SmE to cleave at residues bearing larger glycans.\nSmE provides a complementary cleavage profile to StcE which, as mentioned above, cleaves at a T/S*_X_T/S motif. In that work, we also demonstrated that StcE is non-toxic to cells and can be employed to release mucins from the cell surface17. Many researchers have since used ourmucinase toolkit, especially StcE, to removemucins from the cell surface and/or degrade mucins in biological samples1,31\u201334. Importantly, the MUC1 repeat sequence HGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPA does not contain StcE\u2019s cleavage motif, so limited digestion occurs within this region35. Given that SmE has a complementary cleavage motif, a combinatorial treatment strategy could enable further degradation of mucins from various biological samples. Thus, we sought to\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6169 2\nunderstand whether SmE is similarly capable of digestingmucins from the cell surface, and whether the enzyme is likewise non-toxic to cells (Fig. 1C). Treating HeLa cells with SmE resulted in a reduction in MUC16 staining by Western blot in a manner comparable to that of StcE (Fig. 1D). We also detected released MUC16 fragments in the supernatant of SmE treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). Importantly, SmE was not toxic to cells under conditions used previously for StcE, although cell death was observed at higher SmE concentrations over longer treatment durations (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. 4). Taken together, these results indicate that SmE, like StcE, can effectively cleave mucins from the cell surface and serve as a tool to probemucin biological function.\nSmE outperforms commercial O-glycoproteases OgpA and ImpA for mucin analysis To compare the activity of SmE in context with widely used, commercially availableO-glycoproteases,wedecided tobenchmark against both OgpA and ImpA19,22,36,37. OgpA was originally identified in Akkermansia muciniphila, a commensal bacterium known to regulate mucin barriers through controlled degradation38. Asmentioned above,OgpA is reported to cleave N-terminally to O-glycosylated Ser or Thr residues, with highest affinity towards asialylated core 1 species39,40. Thus, typical\nworkflows with this enzyme involve removal of sialic acids, which limits its use to site-mapping rather than providing information on native glycan structures. ImpA is derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that can cause severe infection41. Like OgpA, ImpA cleaves N-terminally to an O-glycosylated Ser or Thr residue; however, this enzyme has been reported to accommodate more complex, sialylated glycans, expanding its glycoproteomic potential beyond that of OgpA. That said, it has been observed that cleavage by ImpA is influenced by amino acid identity in the P1 position22,37.\nTo directly compare the activities of OgpA, ImpA, and SmE, mucin-domain glycoproteins were digested in the presence and absence of sialidase, followed by gel electrophoresis (Supplementary Fig. 5), MS analysis, and manual glycopeptide validation (Supplementary Data 1\u20135). Additionally, we included fetuin to investigate the enzymes\u2019 selectivity for mucin glycoproteins (Supplementary Data 6). As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, B, we confirmed the reported cleavage motifs and glycan preferences of both OgpA and ImpA. Notably, after ImpA digestion, we did not detect any glycosites in the P1 position, suggesting that ImpA does not cleave between two glycosylated residues. Given that mucin domains contain many neighboring O-glycosites, this presents a significant limitation in the use of ImpA for mucinomic analysis.\nP1\u2019?\nn=587\nP1P2P3P4P5 P1\u2019 P2\u2019 P3\u2019 P4\u2019 P5\u2019\n?\nn=284\nP1\nGalNAc GlcNAc\n?

Proteinswere transferred to anitrocellulosemembrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad) at a constant 2.5 A for 15min.\nTotal protein was quantified using REVERT stain before primary antibody incubation overnight at 4 \u00b0C. An IR800 dye-labeled secondary antibody was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for visualization on a LiCOR Odyssey instrument. E HeLa cells were treated with SmE and StcE at 0, 0.05, 5, and 500 nM. At t = 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 h post-treatment, PrestoBlue was added according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6169 3\nIn contrast, we found that SmE activity was not limited by glycan complexity or adjacent glycosylation (Figs. 1B, 2C). Perhaps for this reason, digestionwith SmE greatly improved the depth and coverage of the glycoproteomic landscape for eachmucin-domain glycoprotein we investigated. The number of cleavage sites, unique O-glycosites, mapped glycan structures, and total glycoforms were all determined (Fig. 2D, see Supplementary Fig. 6 formapsof all cleavage events). Here, total mapped glycan structures were calculated by counting every O-glycan associated with each O-glycosite. Unique glycoforms refers to the total number of validated glycopeptides that were identified from protein digestions. In our analyses, we found that OgpA allowed for the identification of 113 glycosites, 182 mapped glycan structures, and 358 unique glycoforms. ImpA demonstrated significant improvement over OgpA, enabling localization of 145 glycosites, 300 mapped structures, and 570 glycoforms. Evenmore impressively, SmE digestion allowed us to identify 205 glycosites, 455 mapped structures, and 887 glycoforms. Notably, using SmEpermitted the identification of 47 unique glycosites, 221 glycan structures, and 498 glycoforms that were not detected using the other enzymes. Previously, glycomic and glycoproteomic analyses of C1-Inh hinted at a total of approximately 25 O-glycosites; however, these were sparingly localized to individual residues9,42,43. SmE enabled full glycoproteomic mapping of the C1-Inh mucin domain (Supplementary Fig. 7, SupplementaryData 1), thus reinforcing the utility of this enzyme. Taken together, SmE greatly outperformed both OgpA and ImpA with regard to glycoproteomic analysis of mucin domains. For a discussion on limitations associated with SmE for MS analysis, please see the Supplemental Information (Supplementary Figs. 8\u201310). Molecular modeling helps rationalize different substrate selectivity between SmE and ImpA Previously, we used molecular docking to better understand StcE\u2019s substrate selectivity17.

E A glycopeptide docked in the active site of SmE (maroon) and ImpA (blue), highlighting differences between key loops and residues of the two O-glycoproteases.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6169 4\nbelonging to the same Pfam family44,45, yet have quite different cleavage motifs, we decided to again use molecular modeling to understand the structural basis behind these differences. OgpA is a singledomain enzyme with a catalytic metzincin motif that is not defined by Pfamand ismore distantly related to SmEand ImpA, and thereforewas excluded from these comparison analyses.\nTo date, four unique crystal structures of ImpA have been determined30,46, including one with a ligand bound at the active site and a second with a ligand bound at an exosite located in the N-terminal domain (PF18650). The structure of SmE, on the other hand, has not yet been elucidated. As such, we aligned structures of all characterized enzymes with a PF13402 catalytic domain47\u201350, including the SmE structure recently predicted by AlphaFold (Supplementary Fig. 11)51,52. We then docked a TIM-4-based bisglycosylated peptide into the predicted SmE structure to provide insight into potential substrate recognition.\nIn its cocrystal structure with (Gal-GalNAc)Ser30, ImpA uses specific residues to recognize glycans branching from P1\u2019 (Fig. 2E, blue). The side chains of the conserved residues Trp692 and Asn720 form polar contacts with the carbonyl of the GalNAc moiety, and the side chain of Arg742 also interacts with the GalNAc. The Gal moiety, on the other hand, does not interact with the enzyme and is projected into solvent. The helix lining the active site of ImpA is short36, indicating that branched glycans could reasonably be accommodated by this enzyme in a similarmanner to that seenwith ZmpB and ZmpC30. These combined factors likely impart ImpA with activity on substrates bearing mucin-like glycosylation at P1\u2019 but little selectivity for particular modifications beyond the initiating GalNAc moiety.\nIn our docked structure of SmE with a bisglycosylated TIM-4based glycopeptide (Fig. 2E, red), we found analogous interactions between conserved residues Trp240 (replacing Trp692 in ImpA) and Asn268 (replacing Asn720 in ImpA) and the GalNAc initiating from P1\u2019. Additional unique contacts were found between the 3-OH of GalNAc and the side chain of Trp288, rather thanwith an Arg residue as seen in crystal structures of ImpA and other PF13402-containing enzymes. Although there is an Arg residue (Arg282) nearby in the sequence, it is not predicted to flank the GalNAc moiety in the AlphaFold structure, and we found that this residue is less conserved in PF13402-containing enzymes than previously suggested (Supplementary Fig. 11)47. Interestingly, a different Arg side chain (Arg318) contacted the 4-OH of the Gal residue, likely imparting further specificity for mucin-like glycosylation. Similar to ImpA, SmE is predicted to have a short active site helix. Here, the branched glycan was well accommodated by the enzyme in our model, and we commonly found orientations that formed contacts between the ligand and the active site helix as well as the preceding loop, similar to what was observed between ZmpB/ ZmpC and their branched ligands (Supplementary Fig. 12)30,48. Together, these results suggest that SmE has better recognition of the initiating GalNAc and Gal residues, and that it likely forms additional interactions with branched glycans.\nNeither the ImpA crystal structure nor the SmE predicted structure contain a beta hairpin analogous to the one found to recognize P1 glycans by the mucinase AM0627 (Supplementary Figs. 11, 13), which also allows glycosylated P1 Ser/Thr residues50. Thus, the steric environment in this region is primarily defined by a single loop that is significantly larger in ImpA than it is in either SmE or AM0627. In our docked structure, we observed that the short loop of SmE allowed the enzyme to easily accommodate the P1 glycan, with neither the GalNAc nor the Gal residue forming direct contacts with the enzyme; the sialic acid residue could interact with the enzyme or project toward solvent18,47,50. The long loop in ImpA, by contrast, sterically clasheswith all three subunits of the P1 glycan\u2014explaining why ImpA is unable to cleave between adjacent residues bearing glycosylation.More broadly, these and prior findings suggest a delicate interplay between the hairpin and loop in determining this enzyme family\u2019s tolerance, preference, or requirement for particular glycans at P1 (Supplementary\nFig. 13). In the case of SmE, the short loop and absence of a hairpin allows the enzyme to tolerate (but not require) larger glycans at the P1 position, which again supports our MS findings.

            "text": "With this tool in-hand,we reasoned that SmE could beused to sequence immune regulatorymucin-domain glycoproteins at themolecular level. In particular, TIM-1, -3, and -4 are key players in immune cell regulation and are predicted to be modified at many O-glycosylation sites53. Each protein contains an N-terminal variable immunoglobulin (IgV) domain followed by a densely glycosylated mucin domain of varying length, a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal intracellular tail54. TIM3 is highly implicated in the regulation of anti-tumor immunity and is beingdeveloped as a target in cancer immunotherapy, thusmuchof the literature to date has focused on better understanding its molecular interactions. In short, when TIM-3 is not bound to its extracellular ligands via its IgV domain, the TIM-3 cytoplasmic tail is thought to recruit cytoplasmic kinases that promote activation of the T cell receptor (TCR), in turn increasingTcell proliferation and survival.When TIM-3 is engaged by its ligands, however, phosphorylation of the TIM-3 cytoplasmic tail reverses this effect to promote a state of T cell exhaustion characteristic of the immune microenvironment of many cancers (Fig. 3A, left)55. As such, several antibodies against TIM-3 are currently being investigated as cancer immunotherapies, often in combination with canonical checkpoint inhibitors like PD-156\u201358.\nCompared to TIM-3, less is known about TIM-1 and TIM-4, potentially because these proteins are predicted to bear more O-glycosites than TIM-3, which complicates their analysis. However, it is known that the combinationofTIM-1blockage andTCRstimulationpromotesT cell proliferation and cytokine production;59 TIM-4 is a PtdSer receptor and binds PtdSer exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells (Fig. 3A, right)60. Whilemuch remains to be discovered about TIM-1 and -4, it is apparent that the entire TIM family plays critical roles in regulating immune responses in normal and dysregulated states. However, only predicted glycosylation sites in the TIM family have been discussed in the literature, leaving their true glycoproteomic landscape a mystery. It follows, then, that we also do not understand how glycosylation contributes to TIM protein\u2013ligand binding, structural dynamics, and intracellular signaling. Ultimately, this lack of information hampers understanding of TIM family structure and function, which could have strong implications for cancer immunotherapy.\nAccording to NetOGlyc 4.061, TIM-1, -3, and -4 were predicted to bear 67, 8, and 66 O-glycosites, respectively. Additionally, we recently developed a \u201cMucin Domain Candidacy Algorithm\u201d that takes into account predicted O-glycosites, glycan density, and subcellular location in order to output a \u201cMucin Score\u201d7. This value was developed as a method to gauge the likelihood that a protein contains a mucin domain; a Mucin Score above 2 indicated a high probability. Interestingly, TIM-1 and TIM-4 scored above 6, whereas TIM-3 received a score of 07. Beyond the biological implications of these proteins, we were curious to understand the glycoproteomic landscapes of the TIM family given the large disparity between proteins in predicted O-glycosites and Mucin Scores. We therefore digested the three recombinant TIM protein ectodomains with SmE and performed MS analysis followed by manual curation of the glycopeptides. Given our earlier observations regarding SmE\u2019s resistance to proteins bearing sparseglycosylation,wedigestedTIM-3with ImpAandOgpA to ensure full sequence coverage and O-glycosite identification. As seen in Fig. 3B, with a full list of annotated glycopeptides in Supplementary Data 4, 7-8, we identified all 67 of the predicted O-glycosites on TIM-1; many of these sites were modified by a myriad of O-glycans, thus demonstrating the massive microheterogeneity in mucin domains.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6169 5\nTIM-4 was similarly dense in glycosylation, and we site-localized a total of 51 O-glycosites (Fig. 3D). In contrast, only 14 sites of O-glycosylation were detected on TIM-3; the glycosylation was also much less dense, although still quite heterogeneous (Fig. 3C). Generally, recombinantly expressed proteins are thought to display relatively simple glycosylation (e.g., core 1 or 2 structures). Intriguingly, despite the fact that these proteins were recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells, we observed not only these glycans, but also highly sialylated and fucosylated structures."

            "heading": "MD simulations of TIM-3 and -4 elucidate the structural and dynamical impacts of glycosylation",
            "text": "Following the initial glycoproteomic mapping, we asked how these different glycosylation patterns could affect the structures, and\npotentially functions, of the TIM proteins. Although the IgV domain structures have been solved via X-ray crystallography and NMR, the mucin domains were excluded from this analysis, presumably due to the high heterogeneity and density of O-glycosylation62,63. After failed attempts to perform cryoEM on the full TIM-3 and -4 ectodomains, we reasoned that molecular modeling and MD simulations could be an alternative method to predict mucin domain structure and to better understand how glycosylation contributes to the dynamic properties of these proteins. As described above, themicroheterogeneity of each glycosite was incredibly high; thus, in order to accurately reconstruct the TIM glycoproteomic landscape, we needed to identify the most abundant glycan at each residue. To do so, we generated extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of every glycopeptide detected from TIM-1, -3, and -4 to calculate area-under-the-curve relative quantitation using ThermoXcalibur (SupplementaryData 4, 7\u20138). The relative abundance of every detected glycan, at each O-glycosite, is depicted in Fig. 4A (right). As others before have suggested, the glycan size and heterogeneity were much lower in areas of dense glycosylation; sparse O-glycosites afforded larger and more diverse glycan structures64,65.\nBy obtaining the most abundant O-glycan at each glycosite, we built two all-atom computational models of the fully glycosylated transmembrane glycoproteins TIM-3 and TIM-4 (Fig. 4A, left) to better understand the contribution of glycan density on the overall flexibility and length of TIMs. Each of these systems contained their respective globular IgV domain, mucin-domain, \u03b1-helical transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail. Approximately 700 and 830 ns of simulation data were generated for TIM-3 and -4, respectively (see SI Methods for full simulation details).\nTo identify the degree to which TIM-3 and TIM-4 mucin domains compress during simulation, we calculated a normalized end-to-end distance for each protein\u2019s mucin domain as a function of time (Fig. 4B). The results indicate that the TIM-3 mucin domain, with only 14 glycans and 71 amino acids, compresses far more significantly than the TIM-4 mucin domain, which contains 51 glycans and 179 amino acids. We quantified this change by calculating persistence length, defined as the distance (in \u00c5) at which the motions of two monomers along a polymeric chain become decorrelated from one another. Strong intramolecular interactions within monomers can lead to highly correlated motions along the polymeric chain, overcoming energetic gains of interactions with solvent or enhanced conformational degrees of freedom, and thus long persistence lengths. Using data fromourMDsimulations,wecalculated thepersistence lengths of the TIM-3 and -4 mucin domains to be 81 \u00b1 24 \u00c5 and 415 \u00b1 10 \u00c5, respectively. Thus, these twomucin domains have drastically different degrees of correlation within their protein backbones, likely originating from their varied degrees of glycosylation (Fig. 4B, inset).\nDuring initial analysis and trajectory visualization, we noticed that the TIM-3 mucin domain underwent a significant degree of bending such that the IgV domain tilted toward the membrane. To better quantify this, we calculated the angle between two vectors for both TIM-3 and -4mucindomains: onedrawn from the central residue to the first residue, and another drawn from the central residue down to the most C-terminal residue (Fig. 4D, see SIMethods for complete details). We observed that the TIM-4 mucin domain largely sampled bending angles close to 180\u00b0, i.e., the TIM-4 mucin domain was largely linear and \u201cbottle-brush like\u201d. The TIM-3 mucin domain, by contrast, bent quite significantly and sampled a large range of different angles with similar probabilities (Fig. 4E, F). It is important to note that, although the results extracted from the simulations suggest differences between the two proteins, our observations concerning the persistence length and bending angles are not fully converged due to limitations on time and computing power, so should be considered preliminary in nature.\nTo investigate the effect of variable glycosylation on mucin identity and functional dynamics, we aimed to quantify total versus\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6169 6\neffective glycosylation in a thoroughly glycosylated mucin domain (as in TIM-4) versus in a sparsely glycosylatedmucin domain (as in TIM-3). Herein, we define the total glycosylation as the ratio of the length of the outstretched, unequilibrated mucin domain protein backbone to the total number ofglycans. Similarly,wedefine effective glycosylation as the ratio of the length of a relaxed, equilibrated mucin domain protein backbone to the total number of glycans. These two values thus illustrate the \u201cheight per glycan (\u00c5)\u201d under outstretched and relaxed conditions. As shown inFig. 4C, theheight per glycan inheavily glycosylated TIM-4 remains nearly the same in both outstretched and equilibrated states: 9.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5 and 8.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5, respectively. This indicates that upon relaxation of the mucin domain protein backbone, O-glycans still maintain a similar distribution relative to one another as in the fully outstretched case, i.e., total glycosylation equals effective glycosylation. However, for TIM-3, the height per glycan distance drops significantly following equilibration, going from 13.5 \u00b1 0.6 \u00c5 to 8.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5. In fact, following equilibration, this height per glycan distance seen in TIM-3becomes similar to those distributions seen in TIM4. Through trajectory visualization, specific glycan-glycan pairs in TIM3 were found to be responsible for a large portion of the decrease in height per glycan distance. Specific distant pairs (\u22653 glycans away from one another) of glycans are seen to interact via hydrogen bonding, almost as if these glycans are \u201cholding hands,\u201d as exemplified by the TIM-3 glycan pair G7 and G4 (glycosylation sites T145 and T162, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 16). These results demonstrate the power ofMD simulations in characterizingmembers of themucinome, as glycoproteomic mapping alone cannot provide atomic-level structural insight, including conformational changes thatmay allow distant O-glycan pairs to find each other and reach new, functionally significant conformations. Functional consequences of TIM protein mucin domains Beyond thedifferences in structural rigidity andextension impartedby altered density of O-GalNAc glycosylation66,67, we sought to uncover other ways in which variable glycosylation of mucin domains might influence protein function. Indeed, our MD simulations revealed that TIM-4 extended approximately 5-fold further from the cell surface than TIM-3 despite having only 50% more amino acids in the extracellular region. Differences in the protrusion of these receptors from the cell surface should impact how accessible they are to their ligands. The immune cell glycocalyx is dominated by CD43 and CD45, which extend up to 45 and 51 nm from the cell surface, respectively68\u201370. With a persistence length of ~41.5 nm, TIM-4 could span much of this distance, bringing its IgV domain close to the external environment. Conversely, the less glycosylated TIM-3 extracellular region relaxes to only ~8.1 nm, suggesting that it would remain obscured by the surrounding glycocalyx. As a result, PtdSer, a ligand for both TIM-3 and TIM-4, might more easily engage TIM-4 on immune cells to alter cell signaling. Interestingly, TIM-3 has multiple ligands, and it has been proposed that these ligands can all interact with TIM-3 simultaneously,\nB\nA\n180120 150 0\n0.12\nD en\nsi ty\nBending angle (\u00ba)\nTIM-4\nTIM-3\nE\nF\nTIM4 TIM3\nRelative Population 10\n0 50 100 150\n0 10 4020 30\nTIM-3 time (ns)\nTIM-4 time (ns)\nTIM-4\nTIM-3\nH ei\ngh t (\n\u00c5) p\ner A A 2\n3\nPe rs\nis te\nnc e\nLe ng\nth (\u00c5\n) 40 0 0 20 0\n8.0 \u00b1 0.2\n8.6 \u00b1 0.3 9.1 \u00b1 0.1\n13.5 \u00b1 0.6\nOutstretched\nEquilibrated TIM 34\n8 10 12 14 Height (\u00c5) per glycan\n4\n2\n0\nD en\nsi ty\nTI M 4 13 0 13 5 14 0 14 5 15 0 15 5 16 0 16 5 17 0 17 5 18 0 18 5 19 0 19 5 20 0 20 5 21 0 21 5 22 0 22 5 23 0 23 5 24 0 24 5 25 0 25 5 26 0 26 5 27 0 27 5 28 0 28 5 29 0 29 5\nTI M 1 13 0 13 5 14 0 14 5 15 0 15 5 16 0 16 5 17 0 17 5 18 0 18 5 19 0 19 5 20 0 20 5 21 0 21 5 22 0 22 5 23 0 23 5 24 0 24 5 25 0 25 5 26 0 26 5 27 0 27 5 28 0 28 5 29 0 29 5\nTI M 3 13 0 13 5 14 0 14 5 15 0 15 5 16 0 16 5 17 0 17 5 18 0 18 5 19 0 19 5 20 0 N1 H1N1 H1N1A1 H1N1A2 H2N2 H2N2A1 H2N2A2 H1N1F1 H1N2 H1N2A1 H2N2F1 H2N2A1F1 N2 H1N3A1 H1N3A1F1 Other Implied Assumed\nD\nC\nFig. 4 | MD simulations of TIM-3 and -4 elucidate the structural and dynamical impactofglycosylation.A (right) XICsweregenerated for each glycopeptide from TIM-1, -3, and -4 and area-under-the-curve quantitation was performed; glycan composition color legend shown in center.

For instance, the TIM-3 ligand Gal-9 is a bivalent lectin that binds glycoproteins decorated with the LacNAc (Gal-GlcNAc) structure and has been shown to crosslink receptors at the cell surface71,72. We hypothesized that by employing both of its carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), Gal-9 can create networks of TIM-3 at the cell surface. Further, these lattices could result in patches of more accessible TIM-3, thereby increasing affinity (and avidity) for other ligands like PtdSer.\nTo test this hypothesis, we assessed the ability of Gal-9 to crosslink TIM-3 by incubating the bivalent lectin with the complete extracellular region of TIM-3 in the presence of the chemical crosslinking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). For these experiments, we employed the variant of Gal-9 developed by Itoh and colleagues to enhance stability and solubility of the recombinantly expressed protein73. Only when TIM-3 and Gal-9 were incubated in the presence of DSS were larger molecular weight complexes observed above the band for monomeric TIM-3 (Fig. 5A, lanes 2-4, Supplementary Fig. 18). As the concentration of Gal-9 increased the bands of these higher molecular weight species intensified, indicating that the shift of TIM-3 into complexes was dependent on the amount of Gal-9 present. Furthermore, the laddered pattern of\nTIM-3 suggests the formation of a lattice that includes these two binding partners.\nWe next asked whether oligomerization of TIM-3 by Gal-9 might enhance its avidity for PtdSer in cellmembranes. Our previous findings demonstrated that TIM-3 binds PtdSer-containing membranes, and that mutations that impair TIM-3 binding to PtdSer reduce its impact on T cell signaling74. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we quantified the TIM-3 binding to PtdSer-containing membranes in the presence and absence of wildtype Gal-9 (Gal-9WT) or variants of Gal-9 with mutations in one CRD (Gal-9R65D or Gal-9R200D) that render the protein monovalent\u2014which should reduce crosslinking of TIM-3. Adding Gal-9WT to TIM-3 enhanced its binding to PtdSer-containing surfaces in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B), whereas the mutated Gal-9 variants did not, indicating that the increased PtdSer binding affinity reflects the formation of a TIM-3/Gal-9 lattice.\nWe were not able to quantify the effects of Gal-9-induced crosslinking on the affinity of TIM-3 for PtdSer because of problemswith Gal9 precipitation at high concentrations. We therefore exploited the SPR approach to perform kinetic analysis and calculate koff (the rate of dissociation) from PtdSer-containing membranes for the different TIM-3/ Gal-9 complexes. Following rapid association with the surface, equilibrium binding was reached for all samples except TIM-3 with Gal-9WT\nC\nTime (s)\nRe sp\non se\nU ni\nts\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n200 400 600\nTIM-3 + Gal-9WT TIM-3 + Gal-9R200D TIM-3 + Gal-9R65D\nTIM-3\n\u25b2 \u25b2 \u25b2\nB\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5\n1000\n1500\n[ssGal9] (\u03bcM)\nRe sp\non se\nU ni\nts\n500\n2000 TIM-3 + Gal-9WT\nTIM-3 + Gal-9R200D TIM-3 + Gal-9R65D\nA\nD Gal-9WT\nGal-9R65D Gal-9R200D\nTIM-3 only\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nk o ff\nse c-\n1\n<0.0001\n0.9486\n0.1039\nFig. 5 | Gal-9 crosslinks TIM-3 to enhance affinity to PtdSer. A Gal-9 and the extracellular region of TIM-3 were incubated in the presence of the crosslinking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). Western blotting for TIM-3 indicated that higher molecular weight species formed with increasing concentration of Gal-9. B Surface plasmon resonancewas used to quantify the impact of (bivalent) Gal-9WT, with those ofmonovalent Gal-9R200D, or Gal-9R65D variants on the binding of TIM-3 to immobilized membranes containing 20% PtdSer and 80% phosphatidylcholine. Lipid vesicles were immobilized on an L1 sensorchip, and protein samples were flown over the surface with 1mM CaCl2. The increase in response units (RU) observed for TIM-3 in the presence of Gal-9WT, Gal-9R65D, or Gal-9R200D is plotted as a\nfunction of Gal-9 concentration.

The continued escalation of signal for the TIM-3/Gal-9WT sample likely reflects continued growth of a TIM-3/Gal-9 lattice on the PtdSer-containing membranes immobilized on the sensorchip. Moreover, Gal-9WT significantly slowed the dissociation of TIM-3 from the PtdSer-containing surface when compared with TIM-3 alone or TIM-3 bound to monovalent Gal-9 variants (Fig. 5C). The resulting curves were fit with a one-phase exponential decay model to estimate koff and quantify the effect of Gal-9WT on TIM-3/PtdSer binding (Fig. 5D). We found that koff for TIM-3 in the presence of Gal-9WT (0.030 \u00b10.002 s-1) was ~9-fold slower than koff for TIM-3 alone (0.27 \u00b10.03 s-1). Mutation in either of the two CRDs in Gal-9 abrogated this effect, with koff for TIM-3 with the mutant Gal-9 variants being unchanged (0.26 \u00b10.01 s-1 for Gal-9R65D and 0.22 \u00b10.01 s-1 for Gal-9R200D). Thesedata argue thatGal-9WT significantly enhances the avidity of TIM-3 for PtdSer through crosslinking multiple TIM-3 molecules and enhancing their access to PtdSer on an opposing membrane.\nAlthough Gal-9 is known to interact with other immune modulators75\u201379, no experimental evidence suggests Gal-9 binds to TIM-4. TIM-4 has a substantially higher binding affinity for PtdSer than that of TIM-374, and also extends further fromthe cell surface thanTIM3 as a result of its increased density of glycosylation, according to our analysis. Thus, TIM-4 likely does not require lattice formation to increase local receptor concentration and improve binding strength. While thesefindings are preliminary in nature, they shed newpotential light on how mucin-type glycosylation impacts the structure and function of important cellular receptors. In the case of TIM-3, we suggest that the relatively sparse glycosylation allows bivalent lectin binding to control the avidity of an otherwise low-affinity PtdSer binder for immune cell control. For TIM-4, which has a high-affinity PtdSer-binding site, dense glycosylation can project it from the glycocalyx in a way that allows it to constitutively bind PtdSer, reflecting the differences in TIM-3 and TIM-4 function."

            "text": "Historically, numerous challenges have impeded the study of mucindomain glycoproteins; however, new tools continue to be introduced to unveil mucin glycosylation status, functional roles, and biological impact. Here, we present an addition to this toolkit and use it to better understand mucin-domain glycoprotein structure and dynamics. We first thoroughly characterized themucinase SmE, which demonstrated a uniquely broad cleavage motif and outperformed commercially available O-glycoproteases, thus enabling unprecedented glycoproteomic mapping of biologically relevant mucin proteins. In particular, we elucidated the glycosylation landscape of clinically relevant immune checkpoint proteins TIM-1, -3, and -4 and used this information to enable glycoproteomic-guided MD simulations. The data afforded by SmE treatment, in concert with MD simulations, has opened the door to a realm of atomic-level insight intomucin-domaincontaining proteins, their structure-function relationships, roles of glycosylation, and the recognitionmechanisms of bacterialmucinases. Ultimately, we developed a powerful workflow to understand detailed molecular structure and guide functional assays for allmembers of the mucinome.\nThat said, we have only begun to unlock the potential of this workflow, especially as it pertains to the TIM family of proteins. To be sure, aberrant glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer and typical O-glycosylation changes involve truncation of normally elaborated glycan structures80. Such shortened glycans could strongly impact the \u201clinearity\u201d of the mucin backbone, thus changing TIM protein protrusion from the glycocalyx and ultimately modulating function. As such, transformed O-glycosylation could have implications for how the glycoproteins interact with each other, their ligands, and as a result, intracellular signaling and T cell cytotoxicity. Future efforts will be devoted to glycoproteomic mapping of endogenous TIM proteins from primary T cells and patient samples to discover how glycan\nstructures change in health and disease. In concert with biological assays, wewill use this information to driveMD simulations that probe how altered glycosylation could affect ligand binding, intracellular interactions, and antibody recognition. Beyond the TIM family of glycoproteins, many other glyco-immune checkpoints have emerged as prominentmechanisms of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance in cancer;31 we envision that our workflow will also help elucidate structure-function relationships in these proteins.\nAside from MS analysis, SmE has the potential to make a larger impact on the field of glycobiology. In our previouswork, we used StcE for clearance of mucins from the cell surface and determined that Siglec-7, but not Siglec-9, selectively bound to mucin-associated sialoglycans17. We then upcycled an inactive point mutant of StcE to develop staining reagents for Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry18. We also took advantage of the mutant StcE to develop an enrichment procedure that allowed for the selective pulldown of mucin glycoproteins7. Finally, and most recently, an engineered version of StcE conjugated to nanobodies was used for targeted degradation of cancer-associated mucins81. Given that SmE is similarly active on live cells, has a complementary cleavage motif, two mucin binding domains, and potentially different endogenous targets, future work will be aimed at investigating whether SmE can augment our current mucinase toolkit and therapeutic strategies.\nPreviously, we developed an algorithm to help identify proteins that have a high probability of bearing a mucin domain7. While we recognized that our definition of a mucin domain was novel but rudimentary, the present work has confirmed that our understanding of mucin domains is incomplete. TIM-1 and -4 were predicted by our algorithm to be high-confidence mucins, whereas TIM-3 received a score of 0. Here, our glycoproteomic mapping combined with MD simulations demonstrated that absolute glycosylation (i.e., O-glycans per amino acid residue) can be dramatically different than effective glycosylation (i.e., O-glycosylation in relation to total surface area after folding). Thus, while density of O-glycosylation can absolutely be an indication that a mucin domain is present, it does not reveal the entire story, and our definition of a mucin domain continues to develop\u2014 possibly requiring subdivision according to the role that high-density versus low-density glycosylation plays. While it would be ideal to obtain high-resolution structures of these mucin-domain glycoproteins, that is likely a long-term objective that will challenge structural biology methods. In the meantime, our workflow is a tangible mechanism for visualizing the enigmatic mucin family to not only better understand the definition of a mucin domain, but to also study the structural dynamics and functions that lie within."

Peptides were then separated on a 15 cm PepMap RSLC EASY-Spray C18 column packed with 2 \u00b5mC18 material (Thermo Fisher, ES904) using a gradient from0-35% solvent B (0.1% formic acid with 80% acetonitrile) in 60min.\nFull scan MS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of 60,000, an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3e5, and amass range from 300 to 1500m/z. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count of 2, repeatdurationof 7 s, andexclusiondurationof 7 s.Only charge states 2 to6were selected for fragmentation.MS2swere generated at top speed for 3 s. Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) was performed on all selected precursor masses with the following parameters: isolation window of 2m/z, 29% normalized collision energy, orbitrap detection (resolution of 7,500), maximum inject time of 50ms, and a standard AGC target. An additional electron transfer dissociation (ETD) fragmentation of the same precursor was triggered if 1) the precursor mass was between 300 and 1,500m/z and 2) 3 of 8 HexNAc or NeuAc fingerprint ions (126.055, 138.055, 144.07, 168.065, 186.076, 204.086, 274.092, and 292.103) were present at \u00b1 0.1m/z and greater than 5% relative intensity. Two files were collected for each sample: the first collected an ETD scan with supplemental energy (EThcD) while the second method collected a scan without supplemental energy. Both used charge-calibrated ETD reaction times, 100ms maximum injection time, and standard injection targets. EThcDparameters were as follows: Orbitrap detection (resolution 7500), calibrated charge-dependent ETD times, 15% nCE for HCD,maximum inject time of 150ms, and a standard precursor injection target. For the second file, dependent scans were only triggered for precursors below 1000m/z, and data were collected in the ion trap using a normal scan rate.\nMass spectrometry data analysis Raw files were searched using O-Pair search with MetaMorpheus against directed databases containing the relevant protein sequence82. Mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm forMS1\u2019s and 20 ppm forMS2\u2019s. Met oxidation was set as a variable modification and carbamidomethyl Cys was set as a fixedmodification. For samples treated with PNGaseF, Asn deamidation was added as a variable modification. For most samples, we used the default O-glycan database containing 12 common structures. For analysis of GP1b\u0251, the database was based on the previously determined glycomic profile8. Files initially underwent a nonspecific search in order to determine the cleavage specificity of SmE. After the cleavage motif was determined, files generated using only an O-glycoprotease digestion were searched with semi-specific cleavage N-terminal to Ser and Thr and six allowed missed cleavages. Samples treated with trypsin were searched with the same parameters, but also allowed cleavage C-terminal to Arg or Lys. Results were filtered to a q value less than 0.01 and manually validated using Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Relative abundances were obtained by generating extracted ion chromatograms and determining area under the curve. After abundances were obtained, each file was checked for the presence of the identified species. When a peak with matching retention time and mass was present, the peak was validated and the abundance recorded. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD039583.\nManual validation of search results After filtering, each identification was validated by at least one person before being added to the curated result files (SI Tables 1\u20138). For each\nputative glycopeptide, the extracted ion chromatograms, full mass spectra (MS1s), and fragmentation spectra (MS2s) were investigated in XCaliburQualBrowser (Thermo). TheMS1was first used to confirm the precursor mass and chosen isotope was correct. It also allowed us to identify any co-isolated species that could interferewith theMS2s and/ or explain unassigned peaks. The HCD and ET(hc)D fragmentation spectra were then investigated to identify sufficient coverage to make a sequence assignment. When possible, multiple MS2 scans were averaged to obtain a stronger spectrum. For HCD, an initial glycopeptide identification was confirmed if the presence of the precursor mass without a glycanpresent (i.e., Y0), alongwith nearly full coverage of b and y ions without glycosylation. For longer peptides, we required the presence of Y0 and fragments that were expected to be abundant (e.g., N-terminally to Pro, C-terminally to Asp). When the peptide contained a Pro at the C-terminus, the bn-1 was considered sufficient. Further,when the sequence contained oxidizedMet, theMet loss from the bare mass was considered as representative of the naked peptide mass. We then used electron-based fragmentation MS2 spectra for localization. Here, all plausible localizations were considered, regardless of search result output. We confirmed the presence of fragment ions in ETDor EThcD thatwerebetween potential glycosylation sites, if sufficient c/z ions were present then a glycan mass was considered localized.\nOther important considerations during manual validation of search results:\n\u2022 After the initial identification of a particular peptide sequence in a strong spectrum, less stringent conditions were needed if the same peptide occurred with a different glycan structure. We used the stronger fragmentation spectrum to determine characteristic fragmentation masses, and then weaker spectra were assigned based on fragment abundance similarity (akin to manual spectral matching). \u2022 In EThcD spectra, ions that had the glycosylation present on the fragment (i.e., c/z ions) were considered more important for localization than the ones that show the fragment without glycosylation (i.e., b/y ions). \u2022 For peptides with a 138/144 ratio under 1.2, we assumed that all glycans in the spectrum were core 1 structures. That is, if two sites did not have coverage in ET(hc)D but the glycan composition was N2, H2N2, or H2N2A4, it was assigned as two N1, H1N1, or H1N1A2 structures to both sites. This was not the case if there was an oxonium ion present at 407m/z, which would indicate the presence of 2 HexNAcs in a single glycan structure. \u2022 When multiple analyses were being compared (e.g. different O-glycoprotease digestions) that could be expected to have the same unique glycopeptides, any given assignment was checked across all files at the same time. Localization in one file was assumed in the other file(s) if the scan was too weak to localize and (a) retention time was identical, and (b) no contradictory information existed in the sequence and/or localization. \u2022 The list of results generated by trainees was reviewed by senior members of the lab. Additionally, any unlikely identifications (e.g., uncommon glycans, a single identification of a glycopeptide) weremanually annotated by the trainee and submitted to a senior member for approval before they were included in the curated results.\nTo obtain as many glycopeptides as possible for the glycoproteomic maps throughout the manuscript, further identifications were made beyond search result verification. This allowed for the identification of mutations, uncommon glycan structures, and anything else that did not fall within the search parameters. We performed these analyses in a number of different ways:\n\u2022 We extracted the HexNAc fingerprint ion (204.0867) from MS2 spectra,whichgives theoverall intensity of theoxonium ion\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6169 11\nthroughout the run. Alternatively, we extracted any HCD scans that triggered an ET(hc)D scan. If any of these highly abundant glycosylated specieswerenot identifiedby the search algorithm, they were manually de novo sequenced. \u2022 Further, if we did not obtain 100% sequence coverage for a mucin domain, peptide sequences were predicted based on the cleavagemotif(s) of the enzyme(s) used. Candidate spectra were found by extracting all scans with oxonium ions and expected fragments from the peptide (e.g., Y0 and N-terminal Pro cleavages). These scans were further filtered by subtracting the naked peptide mass from the precursor mass and matching the remaining mass to different combinations of glycan masses. For spectra that had mass differences matching a glycan mass, the sequenceswere then validated and localized as described above. \u2022 Finally, to assure we obtained the highest number of glycoforms (i.e., peptides with different glycan compositions and/or glycosites), we used a similar extraction technique. For any potential glycopeptide that was poorly scored/identified by the search algorithm, we extracted expected fragments and any spectra with a newglycan compositionwere then validated and localized as described above. For example, TIAVFT (TIM-4) had a lot of identified glycoforms (>50) because it fragmented well by HCD, whereas the search algorithm only identified one TVRT (TIM-1) unique glycopeptide. Using this technique we found a total of 6 unique glycopeptides from TVRT, all of which were more abundant than the identified one (2xN1), but had worse HCD spectra (i.e., fewer b/y fragment ions) because the glycans were more extended."

To avoid bias toward smaller glycan structures while minimizing the inconvenience of typing multiple isotopemasses into XCalibur QualBrowser (Thermo) for each peptide, abundances were calculated using a variable number of isotopes. Only the 12C peak was used for anything under 1600 Da, the 13C was also included up to 2400Da, and three isotopes were collected over 2400Da. These values were chosen based on the predicted isotopic distributions for given intact peptide values to allow the majority of the signal to be incorporated. All charge states were included when determining the abundance of a given glycoform. Glycopeptide abundances were taken using the file collected with ETD, even if localization took place using the paired EThcD file. If the protein required a secondary file with PNGaseF treatment in order to identify O-glycosites near N-glycosylation sites (TIM-4, TIM-3). In these cases, the PNGaseF treated file was used to record abundances.\nTo generate Fig. 4A and determine the most abundant glycan at each site of TIM-3 and TIM-4, we used the above method with additional steps. First, themost abundant core type was determined based on the combined area from each category (Tn, core 1, core 2, or \u201cother\u201d), then the most abundant glycan within the category was chosen to investigate. Thereafter, when a residue was observed with a particular glycan structure, but with different glycans throughout the rest of the peptide (i.e., different glycoforms), the abundances of all peptides containing that glycosite with that glycan were summed to get the value for the \u201cmost abundant glycan\u201d."

            "text": "Note on Model Scale and Parameter accuracy: Given the size of TIM-3 and TIM-4 glycoproteins, and given the nature of the biophysical questions addressed in this work, all-atom models (as described below) were deemed most appropriate to capture large-scale protein motions while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, given the fact that there currently exist no parameters for coarse-grained O-glycan models, the all-atomscalewas themost efficient andonly scale capable of modeling TIM-3 and TIM-4 at the time of this work. Additionally, given the importance of hydrogen bonding in glycan dynamics and conformations, implicit solvent was deemed inappropriate for modeling and thus explicit solvent (TIP3 waters) was determined to be required. Finally, the CHARMM36 force field is one of the most welldeveloped force fields for the simulation of glycans83.\nProtein construction. TIM-3 protein model was built from the following component models: X-ray crystal structure of the TIM-3 IgV domain (PDB 7M41)84, mucin-domain backbone constructed from the BuildPeptide tool in ROSETTA85 from the FASTA sequence, and the transmembrane tail and cytoplasmic domains modeled with AlphaFold (AF Q8TDQ0)51,52. TIM-4 protein model was built from the following component models: X-ray crystal structure of the TIM-4 IgV domain (PDB 5F7H)86, mucin-domain backbone constructed from the BuildPeptide tool in ROSETTA from the FASTA sequence, and the transmembrane tail and cytoplasmic domains modeled with AlphaFold (AF Q96H15). Each of these domains were then joined together using psfgen in VMDTools87. PropKa388 was used to identify appropriate protontation states at pH 7.4: All aspartate and glutamate residues were determined to be deprotonated and negatively charged; histidines were determined to be singly deprotonated and neutral (kept inHSDprotonation state); lysines and arginineswere determined to beprotonated andpositively charged; tyrosinesweredetermined to be protonated and neutral.\nGlycosylation. An FA2 glycan was chosen for the identified N-linked glycan positions on TIM-3 and TIM-4 (N99 & N171, N291, respectively) as that was consistent with the known glycoprofile at these positions, and full characterization of N-linked glycan positions is outside the scope of this current work. For all O-linked glycans, the glycan structure at each position with the highest population, as determined by MS, was chosen and modeled and constructed onto each site using CHARMM-GUI89.\nLipid bilayer insertion. Complete TIM-3 and TIM-4 models were then inserted into lipid bilayer patches with compositions similar to that of mammalian cell membranes (56% POPC, 20% CHL, 11% POPI, 9% POPE, and 4% PSM)90,91.\nSolvation and neutralization. Finally, the TIM-3 and TIM-4 systems were embedded into orthorhombic boxes, explicitly solvated with TIP3watermolecules, and neutralized to a concentration of 150mMof NaCl, resulting in systems of 846,793 and 2,122,863 million atoms, respectively. See Table 1 for a complete system breakdown:\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations. All MD simulations were performedwithNAMD2.1492 andCHARMM36mall-atomadditive force fields93\u201399 on a private supercomputer in the Triton Shared Computing Cluster hosted by the San Diego Supercomputer Center100. Lipid tail minimization and melting: All atoms except lipid tails were held fixed according to a Lagrangian constraint (i.e. the \u201cfix\u201d command inNAMD), while lipid tails were subjected to 10,000 steps of Steepest Descent minimization. Then, a heating step was performed wherein, with constraints on all atoms except for lipid tails, the system temperature was incrementally increased from 10K to 310 K for 0.5 ns at 1 fs/step. Total system minimization and equilibration: Following lipid tail melting, the Lagrangian constraints were removed from all atoms, but an energetic restraint (1 kcal/mol/\u00c5) was applied to all protein and glycan atoms. The complete system was then subjected to 10,000 steps of Steepest Descent minimization, followed by 0.5 ns of equilibration at 310K (at a 1 fs timestep). After free total minimization and restrained equilibration, the TIM-3 and TIM-4 structures were branched to perform replicas of the following MD simulation protocols. TIM-3 was branched into 4 replicas and TIM-4 was branched into 3 replicas. Free equilibration: Finally, all restraints were removed (thus no restraints or constraints on the system at all) and all atoms were allowed to equilibrate for 0.5 ns at 310K (1 fs/step). Production: A total of 700ns and 830 ns (2 fs/step) were collected for TIM-3 and -4, respectively, see Table 2 for a breakdown of per replica sampling. MDAnalysis was then used to perform all of the resultant analyses fromMD simulations101,102.\nPersistence length calculations. The polymer module in MDAnalysis101,102 was used to calculate the persistence length of TIM-3 and TIM-4 mucin domains by defining a mucin polymer as the N, CA, and C, atoms along the backbone for the following residue selections: TIM-3, residues 133 to 198, TIM-4: residues 137 to 310. Per replica and per TIM protein, persistence length was calculated using the last 1000 frames of simulation. We calculated persistence lengths from each replica trajectory, and thuswe have reported the average and standard deviationof persistence lengths calculated for eachTIMmucin domain over the three replicas.\nEnd-to-end distance calculations. The distances module in MDAnalysis101,102 was used to calculate the distance in Angstroms (\u00c5) between the center of mass of the last residue of the globular IgV domain and the center of mass of the first residue of the transmembrane helical domain for every frame in each simulation trajectory. For TIM-3 these first and last residues were selected as 133 and 198,\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6169 13\nrespectively, and for TIM-4 these residues were 137 and 310, respectively. We then normalized the calculated distances by the total number of protein residues within each mucin domain.\nBending angle calculations. To calculate the bending angle, we used MDAnalysis101,102 to select the center of mass of the first, middle, and final protein residue within each mucin domain. We then used these positions to calculate vectors: one from the middle residue to the first residue of each mucin domain, and one from the middle residue and the last residue of eachmucin domain. For TIM-3, the first, middle, and last residues were selected as residues 131, 166, and 202, respectively. For TIM-4, the first, middle, and last residues were selected as residues 135, 225, and 314, respectively. We then calculated the angle between these vectors for each frame for all three replica trajectories. We plotted these results as normalized density histograms.\nShared structures, trajectories, and input files. A compressed tar.gz file is included with the supporting information of this work. These shared files include: starting coordinates, final coordinates, NAMD input files, and complete stripped trajectories of TIM-3 and TIM-4 glycoproteins.\nMucinase structure overlays, molecular docking, and TIM-4 grafting Structural comparison and docking were performed using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2020.09. TheX-ray crystal structures of ImpA30,46, AM062749,50, ZmpB30, ZmpC48, and BT424430 were superimposedwith the AlphaFold-predicted structures51,52 of SmE, AM0908, and AM1514 using the catalytic histidine and glutamate residues to guide alignment45.\nFollowing this, a ligand was generated over several steps for use in docking studies. First, the bisglycosylated ligand cocrystallized with AM062750 was placed into the analogous location of the superimposed SmEmodel structure. The amino acid residues of the peptidewere then mutated to match a TIM-4 sequence (Ala189-Val190-Phe191-Thr192*Thr193*-Ala194, where the asterisk indicates glycosylation) that was found tobe cleavedby SmEbut not ImpA. Thepeptide\u2019sN terminuswas acetylated and its C terminus was N-methylated to better approximate the steric/electronic environment of a substrate.While holding the SmE model structure fixed, the glycopeptide was allowed to preliminarily minimize in the Amber10:EHT forcefield103 using restraints to ensure contacts were formed between (1) the backbones of the glycopeptide and the beta strand of the active site as well as (2) the GalNAc moiety and the side chains of the conserved residues Trp240 and Asn268.\nDuring our glycoproteomic mapping, we observed high occupancy ofH1N1A1 (or smaller fragments thereof)modifying Thr192 at P1 and H2N2A1 (or smaller fragments thereof) modifying Thr193 at P1\u2019 (Supplementary Fig. 18). Similar to previous work17,104, the P1 glycan was generated by grafting a sialic acid residue onto the 3-OH of the Gal moiety, using the glycan bound to the GspB Siglec domain (PDB 5IUC) as a template105. The P1\u2019 glycan was similarly generated by grafting the remaining GalNAc, Gal, and Sia residues onto the 6-OH of the GalNAc moiety branching from P1\u2019 using the glycan present on PSGL-1 in its cocrystal structure with P-selectin (PDB 1G1S)106.\nFollowing this, the resulting glycopeptide underwent conformational search, holding all atoms except for the newly-grafted glycans fixed, using LowModeMD to generate a library of over 1300 different conformations of these sugar residues107. Each conformer underwent virtual screen, holding the mutant SmED245A enzyme (replacing the catalytic residue to facilitate docking) rigid while allowing the glycopeptide ligand to move freely. The ligand-enzyme complexes with the top 100 docking scores were then used in induced fit docking, keeping both the ligand and the enzyme free. This stepwise search, screen, and docking process allowed us to thoroughly explore conformational space of the ligand while minimizing computational resources.\nFollowing this, the docked ligand was then grafted together with TIM-4 fragments from dynamics simulations to generate larger glycopeptide ligands. First, data from the TIM-4 simulationwere analyzed to identify frames containing structures that have Ramachandran angles for Val190 and Phe191 that were within \u00b115o of those in the docked structure (Val190: \u03c6 = \u2212140o, \u03c8 = 152o; Phe191: \u03c6 = \u2212136o, \u03c8 = 102o). Corresponding fragments (Pro175-Phe191) of ten different structures were manually superimposed on the docked structure, using Val190 andPhe191 to guide placement. Finally, the docked ligand (Val190-Ala194) was grafted onto each fragment (Pro175-Ala189) to generate ten larger glycopeptides used to identify the potential for interaction with the mucin-binding module of SmE."

Protein expression was induced with 0.1mM isopropyl-\u03b2D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 20 \u00b0C overnight (16 h). After overnight induction, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 36ml of 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5M NaCl, 1mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell suspension was sonicated on ice with an ultrasonic processor (Cole-Parmer) for 6 cycles of 2min sonication in 1 s on/1 s off\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6169 14\nbursts at 20% amplitude, with 1min rest intervals between cycles. Following sonication, lysate was mixed with 10% (w/v) Triton X-100 (4mL) by gentle stirring for 30min at 4 \u00b0C. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 xg, 4 \u00b0C for 30min. Recombinant proteins were recovered by batch-wise absorption on 2ml of \u03b1-lactose-agarose gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The gel was packed into a Kontes column by gravity flow, washed with 20 gel-bed volumes of 20mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15M NaCl, eluted with 1 gel-bed volume of 20mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15M NaCl, 0.2M lactose. Peak fractions were then dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.5 (phosphate buffered saline). The dialysate was centrifuged at 25,000g for 20min to remove minor amounts of precipitants. The resulting supernatant was then desalted into 10mM HEPES pH 7.6, 0.15MNaCl using aZeba\u2122 SpinDesaltingColumn, 7Kmolecularweight cut-off and further sterilized by filtration (0.22 \u00b5m). The protein concentration was determined bymeasuring the UV absorbance at 280 nm and converting the absorbance into protein concentration using the Beer-Lambert law, using an estimated extinction coefficient of 28420M\u22121 cm\u22121. The purified proteins were stored at 4\u02daC until use.\nExpression and purification of recombinant TIM-3 Aspreviously described74, TIM-3was expressed andpurified in Expi293 cells, according to the Expi293 Expression System manual. Cells were seeded to 3.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mL and then were transfected with a mixture of DNA vector (pcDNA-TIM-3), Expifectamine reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific), and Opti-MEM. After 4\u20136 days, culture was harvested by centrifugation, and culture supernatant was dialyzed against 10mM HEPES pH 7.6, 0.15M NaCl (4 times the culture volume). Nickel affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and size exclusion chromatography were then used to purify the diafiltered supernatant. The protein sample was sterilized by filtration (0.22 \u00b5m). A NanoDrop spectrophotometer was used to detect absorbance at 280 nm, and protein concentration was determined using an estimated extinction coefficient (25815M\u22121 cm\u22121)."

Lipid solutions were combined at the appropriate molar ratios of DOPS/DOPC in a glass vial. Chloroformwas dried first by nitrogen gas, then by exposure to vacuum. Following rehydration with 0.5mL 10mM HEPES pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, lipid solutions were mixed by vortexing and were subjected to at least 10 cycles of liquid nitrogen freezing and thawing in a sonicatingwater bath to generate unilamellar vesicles. After freeze/thaw cycles, unilamellar vesicles were stored at\n\u221220 \u00b0C. Sonicated vesicles were thawed and extruded before use using an Avanti Mini Extruder (100 nm filter membrane) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nSurface plasmon resonance studies Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of TIM-3\u2014PS interactions in the presence of Gal-9 was performed with a Biacore 3000 instrument, as described74. Lipid vesicles containing 100% DOPC or 20% DOPS were immobilized by flowing extruded lipid vesicles across an L1 sensorchip (Cytiva). Protein solutions containing a fixed concentration of TIM-3 (6 \u00b5M) with 1mM CaCl2 and two-fold serially diluted wildtype or mutant ssGal9 flowed across lipids immobilized on the sensorchip. Resonance units detected by the Biacore 3000 were corrected for background (100% DOPC) binding and were plotted as a function of Gal-9 concentration. The dissociation kinetics were determined with GraphPad Prism using a nonlinear regression model with the dissociation one phase exponential decay equation Y = (Y0\u2212NS)*exp(\u2212K*X) + NSwhere Y0 is the binding at time zero, NS is nonspecific binding at infinite times, and K is equivalent to the rate constant for the dissociation of the protein\u2013ligand complex, koff."
