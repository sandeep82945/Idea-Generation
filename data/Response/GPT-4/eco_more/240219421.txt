Exploring Bias in Content Selection by Chat-based Search Engines: Investigate potential biases in the selection of sources by chat-based search engines like Bing Chat. This could involve analyzing whether certain domains, ideologies, or types of content are systematically favored or marginalized, considering factors like political orientation, geographical origin, and the diversity of perspectives.

Improving Transparency and Interpretability of LLMs in Search Engines: Develop methodologies or frameworks to enhance the transparency and interpretability of large language models (LLMs) used in chat-based search engines. Research could focus on techniques for explaining the rationale behind source selection and response generation, potentially improving user trust and the reliability of search results.

Evaluating Economic Implications of Chat-based Search Engine Source Preferences: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of chat-based search engines' preferences for certain types of content over others. This research could assess how visibility in chat-based search engine responses influences web traffic, advertiser strategies, and overall market dynamics within the digital economy.

Investigating the Role of User Feedback in Shaping LLM Preferences: Explore how user interactions and feedback influence the evolution of LLMs in chat-based search engines. Research could examine mechanisms for incorporating user feedback into LLM training processes effectively, aiming to align the models more closely with user expectations and ethical considerations.

Cross-Model Comparison of Information Retrieval Strategies: Compare the information retrieval strategies of various LLMs employed across different chat-based search engines (e.g., GPT-4 in Bing Chat vs. models used in Google's Bard). This study could identify unique characteristics and strengths of each model, offering insights into best practices for information retrieval and response generation in AI-driven search platforms.
