TheMukaiyama aldol reaction is generally a Lewis-acid catalyzed cross-aldol reaction between an aldehyde or ketone and silyl enol ether. It was first described by Mukaiyama in 1973, almost 5 decades ago, to achieve the enantioselective synthesis of b-hydroxy carbonyl compounds in high percentage yields. Mukaiyama aldol adducts play a pivotal role in the synthesis of various naturally occurring and medicinally important organic compounds such as polyketides, alkaloids, macrolides, etc. This review highlights the significance of the Mukaiyama aldol reaction towards the asymmetric synthesis of a wide range of biologically active natural products reported recently (since 2020). 1. conclusions This review provides a broad overview of the syntheses of a diverse range of natural products, which involve the

Mukaiyama aldol reaction as a major step in their synthetic methodologies, reported in the literature during the period 2020–2023. The aldol reaction is a Lewis-acid catalyzed reaction between silyl enol ether and carbonyl compounds which results in the synthesis of aldol adducts that are highly diastereoselective in nature and are generated in enantiomeric excess.
