 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a quantitative study with a larger sample size to examine if the qualitative findings generalize more broadly. The current study was limited to 20 students at one institution. A larger quantitative study across multiple institutions could validate whether the gender differences found qualitatively hold true more universally. 

2. Examine how intersecting identities (e.g., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status) influence participation in EEPs, beyond just gender. The current study focused specifically on gender differences. Looking at intersections of identities could reveal new insights into what deters or encourages participation.

3. Develop and test instructional interventions to make EEPs more inclusive for women. For example, redesigning pitch competitions or having women role models provide testimonials. Then empirically evaluate their impact on women's participation and experience.

4. Conduct longitudinal research that follows students through their career trajectories after participating in EEPs. This could shed light on whether EEPs have long-term impacts on actual entrepreneurial engagement and success. 

5. Examine faculty perspectives on increasing diversity and inclusion within EEPs. Interview or survey faculty who teach entrepreneurship courses to understand the barriers and opportunities they see to creating more equitable programs.
