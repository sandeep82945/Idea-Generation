 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the degradation of a wider range of pharmaceuticals and personal care products by UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O8 to better understand the efficiency of the processes on different compound classes. 

2. Conduct cost-benefit analyses and pilot-scale trials to optimize oxidant precursor concentrations for maximum efficiency and minimum cost. Assess how the optimal concentration changes based on matrix composition.

3. Study the degradation kinetics and pathways of pharmaceutical mixtures rather than individual compounds to better mimic real wastewater conditions. Examine potential synergistic or antagonistic effects.

4. Evaluate the toxicity and estrogenicity of treated effluents using bioassays to ensure degradation byproducts are not more toxic or persistent than parent compounds.

5. Examine the integration of UVC/oxidant processes into rural WWTPs by conducting longer-term pilot trials. Assess variability in performance across seasons and operational factors like lamp fouling or aging.
