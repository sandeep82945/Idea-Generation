            "text": "Optical metasurfaces enable powerful light manipulation by controlling the amplitude,\nphase, polarization, and frequency of light at the subwavelength scale with an array of point-like scatterers at an interface1. This principle has been used to achieve versatile wavefront manipulation on platforms such as beam deflectors2,3, ultra-high numerical aperture lenses4,5, and on-chip holograms6,7. However, due to their static nature, the functions performed by these structures are\nfixed at the time of fabrication. Reconfigurable functions can be achieved by introducing a material with dynamically tunable optical properties8. This is done in active metasurfaces, where a\nreconfigurable material changes the scattering properties of an array of identical metasurface unit\ncells. Active metasurfaces based on co-integration of scatterers and active materials have been realized with transparent conducting oxides9\u201311, liquid crystals12, phase-change materials13\u201315, thermo-optic materials16 and graphene17, which led to demonstrations of dynamic beam scanning9,18,19, varifocal lenses20, and polarization conversion21. However, these concepts rely on\ncoupling tunable materials with resonant nanostructures, cavities, or antennas that are highly\nsensitive to geometric parameters and typically only operate over a limited wavelength range. As\nstructures for controlling the propagation of light become increasingly complex and compact, the\nneed for new materials that can exhibit unique, strong light-matter interactions in the ultra-thin\nlimit is growing rapidly.\nExcitonic materials, such as two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials, are especially\nattractive as their resonant properties are intrinsic to the material and do not rely on coupling to cavities or antennas22,23. In the monolayer limit, the optical response of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is dominated by excitonic resonances22,24\u201326, which are highly tunable with external electric field or doping27,28, dielectric environment engineering29,30, and strain31,32.\nManuscript: Excitonic beam steering in an active van der Waals metasurface Page 3 of 20\nThe strong light-matter interactions from these excitonic resonances provide opportunities to\ndesign active optical devices where a single monolayer TMDC can act as both the resonant\nscatterer and the tunable material. Among different TMDCs, molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) exhibits especially large tunability of its optical properties at cryogenic temperatures. Without external enhancement or coupling to optical cavities, excitonic reflectivity of over 80%33,34 and tunability of over 200% in the real and imaginary part of the refractive index35 have been shown\nby modifying the radiative and nonradiative rates in MoSe2. These rapid advances in understanding exciton resonances have stimulated thinking about active metasurfaces that exploit the excitonic modulation phenomena to enable van der Waals active metasurfaces36,37. For example, excitonic resonances have been used to demonstrate an intensity-tunable lens with a fixed focal length38 or to steer a focused beam at an edge of three MoSe2 flakes39. However, despite much progress, the dynamic control thus far has been limited to amplitude modulation or local point control of an\nedge, and versatile wavefront control of reflected light from a single atomic layer has remained an\noutstanding challenge.\nHere, we show that tunable exciton resonances in MoSe2 can be harnessed to design an\nexcitonic phased array metasurface for dynamic beam steering. We can model the gate-tunable\nrefractive index by modifying the radiative and nonradiative rates of the excitons with applied\npotential, which gives rise to large amplitude and phase modulation of the scattered light. We also\nexperimentally show how under varying voltage configurations, the reflected light can be steered\nto different angles at three wavelengths corresponding to the A exciton, B exciton, and trion\nresonances. The observation of the beam steering at three distinct excitonic wavelengths in the\nabsence of coupling to antennas or gratings reveals the steering is independent of geometric\nresonances. Our results can be extended to other classes of ultra-thin materials that exhibit tunable\nManuscript: Excitonic beam steering in an active van der Waals metasurface Page 4 of 20\nexcitonic resonances such as black phosphorus36,40, semiconductor quantum dots41,42, and layered perovskites43,44, opening a new path for designing atomically-thin, reconfigurable metasurfaces."

Light impinges at\nnormal incidence polarized along the y direction, and is reflected after passing through the\nheterostructure. The refractive index in the MoSe2 layer is periodically modulated along the x direction via a gate voltage V(x) applied to the periodically arranged gold electrodes. This local\nmodulation imparts an electrically tunable phase shift \u03c6(x) to the reflected wavefront. Imposing a\nconstant phase gradient on the reflected wavefront then deflects the reflected beam to an angle.\nFigure 1b illustrates this electrically controlled light deflection at the A exciton wavelength with\nthe electric field intensity in a cross-section of the surface as calculated by full wave\nelectromagnetic simulations.\nIn designing our metasurface, we first consider the voltage dependent optical response of\nmonolayer MoSe2 at 6 K. At cryogenic temperatures, the optical response of MoSe2 is dominated by the A exciton, trion, and B exciton resonances where the linewidths of these three oscillators are much narrower than their linewidths at room temperature33. By exploiting the narrow excitonic\nlinewidths at low temperatures, combined with Fermi level control via electrical gating of the carrier density, the refractive index of MoSe2 can be modulated by over 200%35. This tunability results from the interplay between radiative and nonradiative decay channels with gating. The dielectric function of MoSe2 takes the form of a sum of Lorentz oscillators33,45:\nManuscript: Excitonic beam steering in an active van der Waals metasurface Page 5 of 20\n\ud835\udf16 = \ud835\udf16! + \ud835\udc56\ud835\udf16\" = \ud835\udf16# \u2212 \u210f\ud835\udc50\n\ud835\udc51$%&'! ) \u210f\ud835\udefe() \ud835\udc38)(\ud835\udc38 \u2212 \ud835\udc38) + \ud835\udc56\u210f\ud835\udefe*() 2\u2044 )) .\nHere, \ud835\udf16# is the background MoSe2 dielectric constant, \ud835\udc51$%&'!is the thickness of the monolayer, and \ud835\udc38), \ud835\udefe(\", and \ud835\udefe*(\" are the resonant energy, radiative, and nonradiative emission rates of the j th oscillator, respectively. In our analysis, we model the dielectric function with two oscillators\ncorresponding to the A exciton and trion and add a background dielectric constant, \ud835\udf16# = 21, to account for oscillators corresponding to higher energy optical resonances of the material outside of our measurement window46. The refractive index of MoSe2 is then obtained by \ud835\udc5b3 = \ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58 =\n\u221a\ud835\udf16. The photoluminescence quantum yield is defined as \u03b7 = \u03b3r / (\u03b3r + \u03b3nr), where the rates correspond to the intrinsic radiative and nonradiative emission rates of the A exciton at the charge\nneutral point. We set the charge neutral point to be at -5 V since our MoSe2 sample is n-doped. Electrical gating of the carrier density then modifies the radiative and non-radiative emission rates,\nyielding the gate tunable refractive index (see Fig. S1, S2 and Supplementary Note 1). Depending\non \u03b7, the MoSe2 dielectric function takes a negative or positive value on resonance, yielding an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) response and hence a tunable transition from metallic to dielectric near\nthe exciton energy, resulting in large changes in reflectance amplitude and phase.\nFigures 2a and b illustrate the simulated gate voltage dependent reflection amplitude and\nphase of our atomically thin metasurface. Here we choose a \u03b7 = 0.5, and a top and bottom hBN\nthickness of 6 nm and 60 nm, respectively, with gold electrodes that are 20 nm thick, 380 nm wide\nand spaced at 120 nm apart (simulated reflectance and phase spectrum for \u03b7 = 0.25 are shown in\nFig. S3). The reflection spectrum is dominated by the gate-tunable A exciton resonance and thin\nfilm interference from the substrate and heterostructure. With the incident light polarized along\nthe gold contacts, tunable reflection originates only from the A exciton of MoSe2, as the local\nManuscript: Excitonic beam steering in an active van der Waals metasurface Page 6 of 20\nsurface plasmon mode of the electrodes is not excited (the corresponding analysis and discussion\nfor illumination with the perpendicular polarization are shown in Fig. S4 and Supplementary Note\n2). The gate voltage induced reflected light phase shift is maximized near the A exciton resonance\nwavelength of 757 nm, and reaches up to a range of 240\u00b0. Figure 2c and d show the voltage\ndependent amplitude and phase of the reflected light at the A exciton resonance for \u03b7 = 0.25, 0.5\nand 0.75. Notably, the available gate voltage-induced phase modulation range strongly depends\non the quantum yield of the MoSe2, with a higher \u03b7 resulting in an increased tuning range. While large values of \u03b7 of up to 90% have been reported, it is important to note that there can be a\nsignificant variation between different monolayer flakes, and also variation within the same flake due to charge and strain inhomogeneities34. Hence, for larger area structures, such as the one\nproposed here, the effective averaged quantum yield is reduced compared to the reported peak\nvalues. However, even with moderate quantum yields ranging between 25-50% a significant phase\nmodulation range is attained. Setting the gate voltage along the metasurface to produce a constant\nphase gradient (according to the look up table in Fig. 2d), allows steering the reflected beam to\narbitrary angles \u03b8. Figure 2e and f show the far field intensity pattern of seven different periodic\nvoltage configurations V(x) that steer the reflected beam between \u201330\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 for \u03b7 = 0.25 and \u03b7 =\n0.5. The seven different voltage configurations generate a phase gradient as required for deflecting\nthe light to the specified angle. The phase periodicities for the angles 30\u00b0, 22\u00b0 and 18\u00b0 are 1.5, 2\nand 2.5 \u03bcm, respectively, where the periodicity was varied by changing the number of electrode\nelements in each period. Even with a reduced quantum yield, light can be deflected to varying\nangles, although the specular reflection remains intense. With a quantum yield of 50%, most light\nis steered into the desired direction, and relatively little intensity is specularly reflected or coupled\nto the opposite direction.\nManuscript: Excitonic beam steering in an active van der Waals metasurface Page 7 of 20\nFigure 3a shows a microscope image of the fabricated metasurface, which contains both a\nmonolayer (blue) and bilayer (red) portion of a MoSe2 flake encapsulated with hBN. We fabricated the metasurfaces by dry transfer of an hBN/MoSe2/hBN heterostructure onto a lithographically patterned substrate with gold electrodes (see methods for details). The electrodes were patterned\nto allow setting a periodic three level voltage gradient, with the first set connected to an external\nvoltage V1 and the third set to V3, and the second set of electrodes floating. The fabricated surfaces were characterized in a cryostat at a temperature of 6 K by performing widefield reflectance\nmicroscopy with a coherent broadband illumination (see methods for details). Figure 3b shows a\nspatial reflectance map of the ungated metasurface near the A exciton resonance at 757 nm. Figure\n3c illustrates reflectance spectra measured on the monolayer and bilayer region at the positions\nmarked in Fig. 3b. In the monolayer region, a clear reflectance minimum is observed at 757 nm as\nexpected due to the A exciton. We note the exciton in the bilayer is redshifted to 767 nm from interlayer hybridization effects and is broader than the exciton in the monolayers47.\nTo characterize the beam steering, we performed spectrally selective Fourier plane imaging\nusing reflected light. For this measurement, we illuminate a large area of the surface (10 \u03bcm in\ndiameter) with a near collimated beam. To avoid effects arising from surface nonuniformity, we\nlimit light collection to an area of 4 \u03bcm in diameter, by means of spatial filtering with an aperture\nin the image plane (see Fig. S5). Figure 3d illustrates the measured spectral Fourier plane image\non the monolayer portion of the sample for four different voltage configurations. For a constant\nvoltage, V1 = V3 = 0 V, the incident beam is specularly reflected to \u03b8 = 0\u00b0, with some light coupled to symmetric side lobes at \u03b8 = \u00b115\u00b0 that arise from the finite imaging aperture. Imposing a\nsymmetrically varying voltage profile, V1 = V3 = -5 V, on the surface couples light into the +1 and \u20131 diffraction order at \u03b8 = \u00b130\u00b0 at the A exciton wavelength 757 nm. Notably, the two deflected\nManuscript: Excitonic beam steering in an active van der Waals metasurface Page 8 of 20\nbeams are separate from the specular reflection and close to collimated, with an angular divergence\nof 16\u00b0. This is a stark contrast to previous demonstrations, where the deflected beam was highly divergent39. The asymmetry in the intensity of the +1 and \u20131 diffraction order is due to the finite\nsize aperture used in the detection. By applying a voltage gradient to impose a linear phase gradient\nalong the interface, V1 = 5 V and V3 = -5 V, we show the asymmetric steering of light into the +1 diffraction order, and the suppression of the \u20131 order. Similarly, by applying an inverted voltage\ngradient, V1 = -5 V and V3 = 5 V, we steer light into the \u20131 diffraction order and suppress the +1 order. In all three cases, the beam steering occurs selectively at the A exciton wavelength, which\nis further evidence of the exciton-induced tunability. The small asymmetry in steering light to the\n+1 and \u20131 is attributed to the finite sized aperture in the detection. Figure 3f shows a spatial map\nof the measured efficiency of coupling reflected light into the +1 diffraction order at various\nlocations of the surface with V1 = 5 V and V3 = -5 V. On the monolayer flake, outlined in blue, there is strong spatial variation in the diffraction efficiency, which we attribute to the spatial\ninhomogeneity of the linewidth and quantum yield. The region with the highest diffraction\nefficiency is expected to concur with the region of highest quantum yield in the MoSe2. In the bilayer region, the diffraction efficiency vanishes at 757 nm, but is observed at the redshifted\nbilayer exciton resonant wavelength of 767 nm (Fig. S6).\nNext, we study the voltage dependence and spectral dependence for the different diffractive\norders at the A exciton energy. In Figure 4a and 4b, we see the intensity at 30\u00b0 is maximized near\nthe charge neutral point of the MoSe2 between -4 V to -5 V, where the A exciton linewidth is the narrowest. As the carrier density increases through either hole or electron doping, the intensity at\n30\u00b0 decreases due to lower oscillator strength and linewidth broadening from increase in\nnonradiative rates. We also observe the blueshift in A exciton resonance energy, which is\nManuscript: Excitonic beam steering in an active van der Waals metasurface Page 9 of 20\nconsistent with previously observed blueshift by Pauli blocking upon doping. The gate dependent\ndiffraction efficiencies for the -1, 0 and +1 diffraction order with the corresponding simulation\nresults are shown in Figures 4c, d, and e, respectively. Under the voltage gradient profile, we see an exchange of the diffraction efficiency of the 0th order and +1 order, whereas the diffraction\nefficiency at the -1 order shows minimal dependence on the applied voltage. At -4 V, the\ndiffraction efficiency is in good agreement with our simulated result of an averaged \u03b7 = 0.25 (Fig.\n4c-e and Fig. S7), which confirms the observed beam deflection arises from excitonic phase\nmodulation in MoSe2.\nAside from the A exciton resonance at 757 nm, we also observe resonances corresponding\nto the B exciton and trion in MoSe2. The spectral Fourier plane images near the B exciton wavelength are shown in Figure 5a. For V1 = V3 = 5 V, we see minimal beam deflection to the +1 order (26\u00b0) due to the suppression of the B exciton resonance. However, under an applied voltage\ngradient, with V1 = 5 V and V3 = -5 V, we observe an enhancement in the intensity at the +1 diffractive order. Figure 5b shows the voltage (V3) dependent diffraction efficiency at the +1 order for wavelengths between 650 nm to 800 nm, where V1 = 5 V and V3 is varied. We observe three prominent features at 670 nm, 757 nm, and 770 nm that correspond to the resonances of the B\nexciton, A exciton, and trion, respectively, suggesting that the incident beam can be steered to a\ndesired angle for three different excitonic resonant wavelengths. Similar to the A exciton, the B\nexciton diffraction efficiency is also maximized near the charge neutral point. However, the\ndeflection efficiency is lower for the B exciton since the linewidth is broader than the A exciton,\nresulting in lower refractive index modulation and phase shift. Moreover, the lower phase shift\nalso results in less suppression of the -1 order, so the beam is deflected to both the -1 and +1 order\neven under an asymmetric voltage gradient (Figure 5c-d). Nevertheless, the observation of steering\nManuscript: Excitonic beam steering in an active van der Waals metasurface Page 10 of 20\nat three different wavelengths that correspond to excitonic resonances shows our design solely\nrelies on tunable excitonic resonances in MoSe2 -a material property- and not geometric antenna or grating resonances."
