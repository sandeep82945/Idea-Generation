1. **Investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning.** This could be done using neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI or EEG to measure brain activity while participants perform the implicit learning task with in-group and out-group feedback. This would help to identify the specific brain regions involved in processing social feedback and implicit learning, and how these regions are affected by the social group membership of the feedback provider.


2. **Examine the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning in different cultural contexts.** The current study was conducted with Chinese participants, so it is unclear whether the findings would generalize to other cultures. Future studies could investigate the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning in different cultural contexts, to determine whether the effects are universal or culture-specific.


3. **Explore the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning in different domains.** The current study focused on implicit rule learning, but it is possible that the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback may also generalize to other domains of implicit learning, such as skill learning, language learning, or social cognition. Future studies could investigate the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning in different domains, to determine the scope of the effects.


4. **Investigate the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning in different populations.** The current study was conducted with healthy adults, so it is unclear whether the findings would generalize to other populations, such as children, older adults, or individuals with cognitive impairments. Future studies could investigate the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning in different populations, to determine the generalizability of the effects.


5. **Examine the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning in educational settings.** The current study was conducted in a laboratory setting, so it is unclear whether the findings would generalize to educational settings. Future studies could investigate the effects of in-group and out-group facial feedback on implicit learning in educational settings, to determine whether the effects can be replicated in a more naturalistic context.
