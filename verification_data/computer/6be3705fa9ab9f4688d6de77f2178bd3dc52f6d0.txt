"More efficient methods are needed in the future to analyze hyperspectral data with high complexity. The processing of the initial data can also be further improved, and the replacement of wavelet transform filters and changes to filter parameters will be further attempted in the future to optimize the whole process in order to develop more efficient and accurate models. In addition to this, laboratory environment can also affect the accuracy of the model. For the best possible precision of the model, changes in the external environment, like temperature and humidity, should be avoided in the online detection of DON levels that affect the spectral acquisition. Hence in the future, further experiments will be carried out on different varieties and growing environments and portable or mobile equipment will be developed to carry out experiments under different field conditions."
