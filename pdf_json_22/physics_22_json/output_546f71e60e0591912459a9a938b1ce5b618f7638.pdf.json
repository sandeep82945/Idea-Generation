    "abstractText": "We present a targeted search for low-frequency (144\u2013215MHz) FRB emission from five repeating FRBs using 23.3 hr of archival data taken with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Voltage Capture System (VCS) between 2014 September and 2020 May. This is the first time that the MWA VCS has been used to search for FRB signals from known repeaters, which enables much more sensitive FRB searches than previously performed with the standard MWA correlator mode. We performed a standard single pulse search with a temporal and spectral resolution of 400\u03bcs and 10 kHz, respectively, over a 100 pc cm\u22123 dispersion measure (DM) range centred at the known DM of each studied repeating FRB. No FRBs exceeding a 6\u03c3 threshold were detected. The fluence upper limits in the range of 32\u20131175 Jyms and 36\u2013488 Jyms derived from 10 observations of FRB 20190711A and four observations of FRB 20201124A respectively, allow us to constrain the spectral indices of their bursts to & \u22121 if these two repeaters were active during the MWA observations. If free-free absorption is responsible for our non-detection, we can constrain the size of the absorbing medium in terms of the electron temperature T to < 1.00\u00d7 (T/104K)\u22121.35 pc, < 0.92\u00d7 (T/104K)\u22121.35 pc and < [0.22\u20132.50] \u00d7 (T/104K)\u22121.35 pc for FRB 20190117A, 20190711A, and 20201124A, respectively. However, given that the activities of these repeaters are not well characterised, our non-detections could also suggest they were inactive during the MWA observations.",

            "text": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are impulsive bursts of radio emission with durations ranging from microseconds to milliseconds (e.g. Cho et al. 2020; Nimmo et al. 2021) and fluences from \u223c 0.01 to 1000 Jyms (e.g. Petroff et al. 2016; Shannon et al. 2018). Their typically large excess dispersion measures (DMs) with respect to the Galactic contribution in the line of sight suggests an extragalactic origin. This has been confirmed through identifying the host galaxies of a few sub-arcsecond localised FRBs (e.g. Chatterjee et al. 2017; Macquart et al. 2020). Although dozens of models have been proposed to explain the emission behavior of FRBs (see Zhang 2020 for a review), their physical origin remains unknown.\nOver the last couple years, the FRB population has rapidly expanded, with more than 700 FRBs published so far, mostly thanks to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME; CHIME Collaboration et al. 2022) Fast Radio Burst project (CHIME/FRB; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2018). In the FRB population there are apparently two classes of FRBs: re-\n\u2605 E-mail: jun.tian@postgrad.curtin.edu.au\npeaters (Spitler et al. 2016) and non-repeaters (Petroff et al. 2015; Shannon et al. 2018), and their progenitors and/or emission mechanisms could potentially be different (e.g., CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019a; Fonseca et al. 2020a). The existence of two populations of FRBs is further supported by recent studies using a large sample of CHIME FRBs (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021b; Pleunis et al. 2021b). Currently, there are 24 sources known to repeat (Spitler et al. 2016; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019a,c; Kumar et al. 2019; Fonseca et al. 2020a; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021b), and there is evidence for periodic activity from two of them, FRB 20121102A (Rajwade et al. 2020b; Cruces et al. 2021) and 20180916B (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020a), which might reflect an orbital (Ioka & Zhang 2020), rotational (Beniamini et al. 2020) or precession (Levin et al. 2020) period. The recent discovery of unusually bright FRB-like emission from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 suggests that magnetars could produce at least some of the extra-galactic FRBs (Bochenek et al. 2020; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020b). This association is further supported by the latest identification of sub-second periodicity from the sub-components of FRB 20191221A (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021a).\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n11 94\n5v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .H\nE ]\n2 2\nN ov\nRepeating and non-repeating FRBs often show different features in their burst properties. For example, on average, repeating FRBs tend to have larger burst widths than non-repeating FRBs (Scholz et al. 2016; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019c; Fonseca et al. 2020a; Pleunis et al. 2021b). The downward drifting of subpulses in frequency with time, i.e. the \u201dsad trombone\u201d effect, appears to be a common feature among repeating FRBs (Hessels et al. 2019; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019b; Pleunis et al. 2021b). While some repeating FRBs share flat polarisation position angles within and between bursts, such as FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B (Michilli et al. 2018; Nimmo et al. 2021), the bursts of FRB 20180301 show a diversity of position angle swings (Luo et al. 2020). Detailed spectrotemporal and polarimetric studies of more repeating FRBs are needed to confirm and explain these features.\nUp until very recently, FRB repeating sources have been detected at frequencies between 300MHz (Chawla et al. 2020; Pilia et al. 2020; Parent et al. 2020) and 8GHz (Gajjar et al. 2018). However, simultaneous observations of repeating FRBs in different bands suggest that individual pulses are narrow-band, yet are scattered across a wide range of frequencies with time (Gourdji et al. 2019). For example, FRB 20180916B has been detected up to 5.3GHz (Bethapudi et al. 2022), yet the absence of simultaneous detections at frequencies 2.3 and 8.4GHz demonstrates its frequency dependent activity (Pearlman et al. 2020). While Chawla et al. (2020) detected FRB 20180916B at 300\u2013400MHz using the Green Bank Telescope, no emission was seen contemporaneously at 110\u2013188MHz using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). Such narrow-band emission has also been demonstrated for FRB 20121102A (Gourdji et al. 2019; Majid et al. 2020) and FRB 20190711A (Kumar et al. 2021a).\nTo date, there have been many searches for FRB emission below 300MHz, including simultaneous, multiband, targeted (Law et al. 2017; Sokolowski et al. 2018; Houben et al. 2019) and widefield blind (Coenen et al. 2014; Karastergiou et al. 2015; Tingay et al. 2015; Rowlinson et al. 2016; Sanidas et al. 2019) searches using LOFAR, the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA) and the Long-wavelength Array. In addition, searches for prompt and dispersed (FRB-like) signals predicted to be associated with gammaray bursts have also been conducted with MWA and LOFAR via rapid-response observations (Kaplan et al. 2015; Rowlinson et al. 2019, 2021; Anderson et al. 2021; Tian et al. 2022a,b), none of which have yielded a detection. However, recently Pleunis et al. (2021a) reported the detection of 18 bursts from FRB 20180916B between 110\u2013188MHz using LOFAR, the only detections of any FRB below 300MHz to date. This confirms the existence and the detectability of low frequency bursts from repeating FRBs at cosmological distances, which are not limited by propagation effects or the FRB emission mechanism. Additionally, this same repeater appears to undergo chromatic periodic activity where its activity window is wider and occurs later with decreasing frequency. This is demonstrated by the \u223c 3 day delay in the peak activity between bursts observed by CHIME/FRB at 600MHz and those observed by LOFAR at 150MHz (Pleunis et al. 2021a; Pastor-Marazuela et al. 2021).\nThere are several reasons for the dearth of FRB detections at low frequencies. First is an increase in the sky background temperature at low radio frequencies (e.g. de Oliveira-Costa et al. 2008; Cong et al. 2021). This can increase the noise level in low frequency observations and reduce the observed signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). As FRB signals propagate through intervening ionized media before reaching the Earth, the effects of scatter broadening of\nthe pulse profiles and intrachannel dispersive smearing, which are more significant at low frequencies, can also reduce the peak S/N. In addition, repeating FRBs are also known to suddenly turn on and enter periods of long-term (> a few years) activity (e.g., FRB 20201124A; Lanman et al. 2022). This makes it difficult to define proper burst rates for sources that exhibit burst clustering, which may be more/less active at higher/lower frequencies (e.g., FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B; Josephy et al. 2019; Pearlman et al. 2020). All of these present challenges to FRB searches at low radio frequencies.\nNonetheless, low frequency FRB searches are very important. A real detection at low frequencies would complement high frequency detections for broadband measurements of the FRB spectrum, allowing more reliable studies of the burst energetics and the emission mechanism. It would also allow us to better constrain the local environments of FRBs based on propagation effects such as free-free absorption. As this effect is more obvious at lower frequencies (optical depth scales as \ud835\udf0fff \u221d \ud835\udf08\u22122.1) , FRB measurements at low frequencies would place more stringent constraints on the size of the emission site (Pleunis et al. 2021a). Low frequency FRB emission is also sensitive to other propagation effects such as the dispersion, scattering and Faraday rotation, and could provide precise measurements of the dispersion measure, scattering timescale and rotation measure of FRBs (Petroff et al. 2022). Therefore, low frequency FRB searches are well motivated scientifically in spite of the observational challenges.\nIn this paper, we use the archivalMWAobservations takenwith the voltage capture system (VCS; Tremblay et al. 2015), which has a high temporal resolution of 100\u00b5s, to search for low frequency (144\u2013215MHz) FRB signals from known repeating FRBs. In Section 2, we describe our selection of MWA observations in the data archive and the data processing and analysis we used for the FRB search. Our results are then presented in Section 3. We discuss the implications of our results for FRB sources and emission models in Section 4, followed by conclusions in Section 5."

There are two observing modes of the MWA: the standard correlator with a time and frequency resolution of 0.5 s/10 kHz and the VCS with a resolution of 100\u00b5s/10 kHz. We chose to inspect MWA VCS observations for FRBs from known repeaters due to their high time resolution, making them specifically sensitive to narrow (\u223cms) pulsed and therefore dispersed signals, i.e. FRB emission.\nThe MWA VCS mode has been extensively used for pulsar studies and searches (Bhat et al. 2016; Xue et al. 2017; McSweeney et al. 2017;Meyers et al. 2018; Swainston et al. 2021). In September 2018, an all sky pulsar search project, the Southern-skyMWARapid Two-meter (SMART) survey (Bhat et al. 2022), was commenced to search the entire sky south of +30\u25e6 in declination for pulsars, with regular data collection planned until\u223c 2023. This survey, alongwith targeted observations toward a number of already known pulsars, generates a large amount of VCS observations in the MWA archive. These all-sky archival data at the highest time resolution available with the MWA, combined with the MWA\u2019s large field of view are\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201312 (2022)\nan invaluable resource to exploit for transient studies and enable the search for low frequency bursts from known repeating FRB sources. The observations we selected for FRB searches were taken between 2014 September and 2020 May, spanning the MWA Phase I and Phase II, which differ in array configuration, and baseline length and distribution. The MWA Phase I presents an angular resolution of \u223c 2 arcmin at 185MHz (Tingay et al. 2013). The MWA phase II has two configurations: extended and compact configurations with angular resolutions of \u223c 1 and \u223c 10 arcmin, respectively (Wayth et al. 2018). Both can be used for FRB searches."

            "text": "We used the first complete FRB catalogue1 (including FRB events published in the Transient Name Server2, FRBCAT and the CHIME/FRB Catalogue; Petroff et al. 2016; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021b) to identify targets for our FRB search, i.e. those repeaters that could be viewed by the MWA. Since the majority of repeaters have been detected by CHIME, which looks at the Northern sky (CHIME/FRB is sensitive to sky locations with declinations > \u221211\u25e6; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021b), only a few of them are located in the MWA observable sky. We filtered through the population of known repeating FRBs using the criterion of their maximum elevation above the MWA\u2019s horizon of > 30\u25e6 (for the choice of the elevation limit, see Hancock et al. 2019), and obtained a list of five repeating FRBs (see Table 1).\nThe five repeating FRBs display varying burst widths, fluences and degrees of activity and repetition rates, as shown in Table 1. FRB 20190711A was first detected by ASKAP in the frequency range 1.1\u20131.3GHz (Macquart et al. 2020), and hundreds of hours of follow-up observations with ASKAP and Parkes detected only one repeat burst at 1.4GHz in the Parkes observations (Kumar et al. 2021a), indicating an extremely low repetition rate. We do not report a burst rate for this repeater in Table 1. FRB 20190116A, 20190117A, 20190213A and 20201124A were first detected by CHIME in the frequency range 400\u2013800MHz, with a burst rate simply estimated by the ratio of the number of detected bursts to the exposure time of the CHIME system on the source (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019c; Fonseca et al. 2020b). The brightest repeater in this sample, FRB 20201124A, was subsequently detected by multiple instruments including the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.5GHz (Law et al. 2021), the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) at 864.5MHz (Kumar et al. 2021b,c) and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) at 1.2GHz (Xu et al. 2021), and reported to enter a sudden period of high activity in 2021 March (Marthi et al. 2021; Piro et al. 2021; Lanman et al. 2022). Thanks to these radio observations between 864.5MHz and 1.5GHz, FRB 20201124A is the only repeater in our sample that has a measured spectral index \ud835\udefc = \u22125.82+0.68\u22120.84 (Kumar et al. 2022). For the CHIME repeaters, the burst rates quoted in Table 1 assume an average rate that does not take into account the likely variable nature of a potential activity window, and thus may not apply to the time windows of the MWA observations inspected in our analysis (see discussions in Section 4.1). Note that the CHIME rates in Table 1 are all based on CHIME observations except for FRB 20201124A, which is estimated for the period of high activity after 2021 March while its rate\n1 https://www.herta-experiment.org/frbstats/ 2 https://www.wis-tns.org/\nprior to discovery is as low as < 3.4 day\u22121 (Marthi et al. 2021; Piro et al. 2021; Lanman et al. 2022).\nWe used the MWA All-Sky Virtual Observatory3 (ASVO) to search for all VCS observations that overlap with the positional errors of the five repeating FRBs, and found 61 observations in the MWA data archive. We then estimated the sensitivity of each VCS observation in the directions of the five repeating FRBs based on the Full Embedded Element model of the MWA (Sokolowski et al. 2017). We selected only those observations with at least 20% of the maximum sensitivity in the primary beam. This resulted in a total of 25 observations with integrations between 15min and 1.5 hr (23.3 hr in total) and central frequencies between 144MHz and 215MHz, as listed in Table 2. Of these observations, 12 were taken in the MWA Phase II compact configuration, and the others were recorded in the higher angular resolution of Phase I and the Phase II extended configuration."

It automates the reduction of MWA VCS data of targeted sources, including downloading, calibration and beamforming at the target positions.

We inspected these solutions and discarded tiles showing poor calibration solutions. We also excised the edge channels (0\u20137 and 120\u2013127) of each of the 24 sub-bands to alleviate the aliasing effects resulting from the channelization process. We applied this calibration process to each MWA observation before coherently summing the power from the constituent tiles."

The performance of coherent beamforming is affected by a few factors, such as the quality of the calibration solution and the pointing direction of the telescope.\nHere we briefly summarise the beamforming process (for more details see Swainston et al. 2022). The essential step is converting cable and geometric delays to the pointing center into phase shifts for each tile. With the knowledge of the delay model and the complex gain information from the calibration solution derived in the calibration process, we can obtain the tile based gain solution to equalise the tile gains and phase all tiles to the same direction.\nWe used the coherent beamforming to phase all MWA tiles to the known positions of the five repeating FRBs, as listed in Table 1. The number of coherent beams we needed to form for each FRB depends on the positional error of the FRB and the angular resolution of the MWA observation. The ASKAP repeater, FRB 20190711A, has a small positional error of 0.38 arcsec (Macquart et al. 2020), well within the synthesized beam of the MWA, so we only needed to beamform the VCS data at a single position. The other CHIME repeaters have a positional error of \u223c 10 arcmin. Depending on the configuration of the MWA, this corresponds to 2\u201316 beams for the phase II compact configuration and \u223c 550 beams for the phase I and phase II extended configuration, as shown in Table 2."

            "text": "The single pulse search was performed using the presto software package (Ransom 2001). Compared to other radio telescopes traditionally used for high-time resolution analysis, theMWAis generally less affected by radio-frequency interference (RFI), so we did not perform any RFI excision that is usually required at higher observing frequencies (see procedures outlined in Swainston et al. 2021). Nonetheless, any spurious events caused by RFI can be identified from the final candidates via visual inspection.\nFirst we dedispersed the time series using the prepdata routine in presto. We determined the DM search range of each observation based on the nominal DM of the target FRB (see Table 3). Specifically, we searched around the knownDMwith approximately \u00b150 pc cm\u22123 but shifted that limit to within the closest multiple of 10 pc cm\u22123, covering a DM range of 100 pc cm\u22123. Given that there is no evidence of DM evolution for the five repeating FRBs analysed in this paper, and the largest DM variation observed for FRB 20190711A and FRB 20201124A is 7 and 10 pc cm\u22123, respectively (likely caused by varying burst morphology; Kumar et al. 2021a, 2022), the DM range we chose is sufficient for the repeat bursts searched for here. We adopted a DM step size of 0.1 pc cm\u22123, resulting in 1000 DM trials for each observation. To reduce the data size, the dedispersed time series were downsampled to a lower time resolution of 400\u00b5s. This would not affect our search for repeating\nbursts given the shortest burst width is 0.64ms in our sample of repeating FRBs (see Table 1) and the general trend of increasing burst widths at lower frequencies (e.g. Chawla et al. 2020; Pleunis et al. 2021a).\nWe performed a traditional single pulse search using presto\u2019s single_pulse_search.py, which convolves the dedispersed time series with boxcars of different widths. We chose different pulse width search ranges for the five repeating FRBs based on their brightness and the sensitivity of the MWA observations. While we searched up to a pulse width of 1.3 s (the maximum scatter broadening expected at the MWA observing frequency; see Section 2.4.3 and Table 3) for the two brightest FRBs in our sample, i.e. FRB 20190711A and FRB 20201124A, we only searched up to 150ms for the other three FRBs as any signals scattered beyond 150ms are expected to have a flux density of < 0.2 Jy, < 1.4 Jy and < 0.2 Jy for FRB 20190116A, 20190117A and 20190213A, respectively (assuming a spectral index of \ud835\udefc = \u22122; see Table 3), which is below the MWA sensitivity of \u223c 1.4 Jy on 150ms timescales. Single pulse events detected with a S/N above six were classified as candidates (e.g. Chawla et al. 2020, Meyers et al. 2018, Bannister et al. 2012). We then applied a friends-of-friends algorithm (Burke-Spolaor et al. 2011; Bannister et al. 2012) to identify possible false positives. In the case of more than five individual boxcar/DM trials clustering into a candidate (e.g. Kumar et al. 2021a), we reserved it for further inspection (see Figure 1 for an example candidate).\nWe tested our data processing and FRB detection pipeline by searching for single giant pulses from the Crab pulsar in a 154MHz MWA observation listed in Table 2 (Obs ID: 1165246816). We ran our FRB search pipeline over a chosen DM range of 56.77 \u00b1 5 pc cm\u22123 (from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue5; Manchester et al. 2005). We successfully detected 89 single pulses with S/N > 10\n5 https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201312 (2022)\nfrom this 15min observation (see Appendix A and Figure A1 for the dedispersed dynamic spectrum of the brightest Crab pulse). In order to calculate the expected giant pulse rate from the Crab at the observing frequency of 154MHz, we took the Crab pulse rate of 0.35 s\u22121 at 185MHz for a fluence > 520 Jyms, the spectral index of \u22120.7 \u00b1 1.4 and the power-law fluence distribution \ud835\udc41 (> \ud835\udc39\ud835\udf08) \u221d \ud835\udc39\u2212\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf08 with \ud835\udefd = 2.88 \u00b1 0.12, all calculated by Meyers et al. (2017). We obtained a pulse rate of 0.03\u20130.17 s\u22121 for a fluence > 1000 Jyms (corresponding to the 10\ud835\udf0e sensitivity of the tested observation). Therefore, the expected number of detectable giant pulses from the Crab at 154MHz within our 15min observation is 27\u2013153, which is consistent with our detection of 89 pulses, and thus verifying the utility of our VCS data processing and FRB detection pipeline."

The overall system equivalent flux density (SEFD) is given by\nSEFD = \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc47ant + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf02)\ud835\udc47amb + \ud835\udc47rec\n\ud835\udc3a , (2)\nwhere \ud835\udf02 is the direction and frequency dependent radiation efficiency of the MWA array, \ud835\udc47ant, \ud835\udc47amb and \ud835\udc47rec represent the antenna, ambient and receiver temperatures respectively, and\ud835\udc3a = \ud835\udc34e/2\ud835\udc58B is the system gain where \ud835\udc34e is the tied-array effective area and \ud835\udc58B is Boltzmann constant (e.g. Lorimer & Kramer 2012). The radiation efficiency \ud835\udf02 at the positions of FRBs can be calculated using a power wave based framework (Ung et al. 2019); the receiver temperature is well characterised across the MWA band; and the ambient temperature is calculated from the metadata of the observation. To calculate the antenna temperature and gain, we need a good knowledge of the tied-array synthesised beam pattern, i.e. the product of the array factor and an individual MWA tile power pattern, which can be obtained from the phase information that points the telescope to a target position and a simulation of the tile pattern as described in Sutinjo et al. (2015). Assuming a sky temperaturemap at the observing frequency based on the global sky model of de Oliveira-Costa et al. (2008), we estimated the antenna temperature and the tiedarray gain by convolving the map with the tied-array beam pattern (e.g. Sokolowski et al. 2015). For the coherent beamforming of the full (128 tiles) MWA, the SEFD is typically \u223c 103 Jy at 154MHz (Meyers et al. 2017).\nBandwidth considerations are needed for the final determination of the minimum detectable flux density in each of the selected MWA observations. As we flagged 16 of the 128 fine channels, the effective bandwidth is reduced to 87.5% of the full 30.72MHz. To correct for this, we need to apply a scaling factor of 0.875\u22121/2 \u2248 1.07 when converting to flux density limits. In the case of bad tiles flagged during the calibration process (see Section 2.3.1), we also need to correct for the corresponding sensitivity loss by assuming the sensitivity scales with the number of tiles. Taking into account the above considerations, we arrived at a 6\ud835\udf0e\nflux density upper limit for each observation, as shown in Table 2. Note that this flux limit is based on the telescope pointing and the source location in the primary beam (with an elevation in the MWA field of > 30\u25e6 as shown in Table 2)."

            "text": "As described above, the sensitivity of MWA observations is characterised by flux density. However, in the context of FRBs it is common to use fluence to represent their strengths. We can convert the flux density limit (which scales as \ud835\udc61\u22121/2) to a fluence limit using\n\ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udc46min \u00d7 (\ud835\udc64obs/1ms)1/2 Jyms, (3)\nwhich is dependent on the pulse duration (\ud835\udc64obs; e.g. Hashimoto et al. 2020). The pulse durations of the five repeating FRBs have been measured at their observed frequencies, as shown in Table 1. We can estimate the expected pulse duration at the MWA observing frequency by \ud835\udc64\ud835\udf08MWA = \u221a\ufe03 \ud835\udc642obs + \ud835\udc64 2 disp + \ud835\udc64 2 scatter (4)\nwhere \ud835\udc64obs is the observed pulse duration at higher frequencies, and \ud835\udc64disp and \ud835\udc64scatter account for the pulse broadening due to dispersive smearing and pulse scattering at the MWA observing frequency. Note that downward drifting of subpulses, which could also broaden pulse widths, is not considered here. The dispersion smearing across the MWA channel, \u0394\ud835\udf08 = 10 kHz, can be calculated at the nominal DM values listed in Table 1 for the five repeaters using (e.g. Anderson et al. 2018) \ud835\udc64disp = 8.3 \u00d7 103 \u00d7 ( \u0394\ud835\udf08 MHz ) \u00d7 ( \ud835\udf08 MHz )\u22123 \u00d7 ( DM pc cm\u22123 ) s. (5)\nFor a typical observing frequency of the MWA, \ud835\udf08 = 185MHz, the corresponding dispersion smearing is \u223c 5ms.\nFRBs also experience scattering. However, given the unknown environment of FRBs the scattering timescale is largely uncertain. We may infer the lower limit of the scattering timescale based on the Galactic contribution. Using the NE2001 model of electron density fluctuations (Cordes & Lazio 2002), we obtained a minimum scattering timescale at 1GHz of 4.3\u00d710\u22125ms, 2.6\u00d710\u22124ms, 1.7\u00d710\u22124ms, 3.2\u00d710\u22124ms and 5.8\u00d710\u22123ms for FRB 20190116A, 20190117A, 20190213A, 20190711A and 20201124A, respectively. The upper limits on scattering timescales have been derived for FRB 20190116A, 20190117A, 20190213A and 20201124A to be < 11ms, < 7.4ms, < 4.0ms and < 11.1ms at 600MHz (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019c; Fonseca et al. 2020b; Marthi et al. 2021). Given FRB 20190711A has no published scattering measurement due to its complex time-domain structure (Day et al. 2020) or low S/N (Kumar et al. 2021a), we assumed a typical scattering timescale of < 10ms (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021b). Assuming the scattering timescale depends on frequency as \ud835\udf08\u22124 (Bhat et al. 2004), we can obtain a range of scattering timescales at the MWA observing frequency. The final lower and upper limits on the scatter broadening can be found in Table 3. Note that the final range in Table 3 was calculated individually for each observation before being combined for each repeater.\nWith the estimated dispersion smearing and scattering timescales, we can derive a range of pulse widths expected for each observation using Eq. 4, which can be further used to derive the final range of fluence limits for each observation using Eq. 3.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201312 (2022)\nThe ranges of fluence limits derived from different observations covering the same repeating FRB were combined to obtain the final range of fluence limits for the repeater, as shown in Table 3."

Following the automated pulse search, we further filtered all candidates with a S/N above 6\ud835\udf0e using the friends-of-friends algorithm. The number of remaining candidates at the position of each repeater is listed in Table 2, totalling 543 candidates discovered in 23.3 hr of VCS data. We visually inspected their pulse profiles and dynamic spectra, and found no evidence of a dispersion sweep, suggesting they are not real signals. An example dynamic spectrum of a candidate burst detected in an MWA observation (Obs ID: 1163853320) with S/N = 6.59 is shown in Figure 1.\nWe derived a flux density limit for each of the 25 MWA VCS observations searched for FRB signals, as shown in Table 2. For FRB 20201124A, the flux density limits ranged between 18.41\u2013 22 Jy. We also inferred a range of pulse widths of 9.52\u20131229ms at the MWA observing frequency of 185MHz for this repeater. With the derived flux density limits and pulse widths, we finally arrived at a range of fluence limits of 36\u2013488 Jyms for FRB 20201124A. We did a similar analysis for the remaining FRBs, and present all results in Table 3. Note that the three faint repeaters in our sample, i.e. FRB 20190116A, 20190117A and 20190213A, were only searched up to a pulse width of 150ms (see Section 2.4.1). The uncertainties in the final fluence limits span more than an order of magnitude, which can be attributed to the largely uncertain scattering timescales. In the best case, i.e. minimal scattering, we would have detected any bursts with a fluence & 50 Jyms. Note that the low-frequency bursts detected by LOFAR from FRB 20180916B can reach a fluence of 308\u00b1 10 Jyms (Pleunis et al. 2021a), much higher than this fluence threshold (see Section 4.5).\nIn summary, no bursts from the five repeaters were detected in MWA observations. Based on their known properties, we inferred a range of fluence upper limits for each repeater, as shown in Table 3, which can be used to constrain the burst properties of the repeating FRB population."

Given their burst rates estimated by CHIME/ASKAP observations (see Table 1), we calculated the expected number of bursts during the MWA observations assuming the burst rate is constant and frequency independent, as shown in Table 3. Based on this, there is a non-negligible chance of detecting bursts during the MWA observations of these repeaters, especially for FRB 20201124A, which can potentially emit 30 bursts within 1.9 hr (Lanman et al. 2022). Therefore, the fact that we did not detect any bursts could suggest that our assumption of a constant burst rate may be incorrect, the FRB emission has a shallow (broadband) or highly peaked (narrowband) spectrum, or the circumburst environment prevents the low frequency radio emission from escaping. In this section, we discuss the constraints placed on the properties of these repeaters by our non-detections."

Interestingly, the most stringent constraint on the burst rate of FRB 20190711A, < 0.11 hr\u22121, is comparable to the lowest observed rate for a CHIME repeater (0.05 hr\u22121 for FRB 20190212A; Fonseca et al. 2020a). Note that the burst rates of FRB 20190711A and 20190212A are measured at different frequencies (154\u2013215MHz for MWA and 400\u2013800MHz for CHIME), and there seems to be an increasing trend in burst rates towards lower frequencies though it is not conclusive (e.g. Pearlman et al. 2020; Pleunis et al. 2021a).\nThere is also another possibility that the repeaters were in quiescence during the MWA observations. That is, the five repeaters may have variable burst rates. This has been shown to be the case for FRB 20201124A. While this FRB has been observed to emit 48 bursts within three hours (Marthi et al. 2021), its rate prior to discovery is as low as < 3.4 day\u22121 (at the 3\ud835\udf0e level assuming a Poisson rate; Lanman et al. 2022). Despite the uncertainties associated with repeater activity, it is worth considering that the repeaters\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201312 (2022)\nstudied here emitted signals during the MWA observations in order to investigate the constraints our observations place on their spectral properties (see Section 4.2) or emission environments (see Section 4.3)."

            "text": "Here we consider that our non-detections of FRB emission is due to low fluences in the MWA observing band. In the case of broadband FRB emission, we can constrain the spectral index using the fluence upper limits we derived for the five repeaters and their observed fluences at higher frequencies. The mean spectral index of FRB emission has been determined to be \u22121.5+0.2\u22120.3 from the summed power of 23 ASKAP FRBs over a frequency range of 1.1\u20131.5GHz (Macquart et al. 2019) and \u22121.53+0.29\u22120.19 by a simulation on a sample of 82 FRBs detected by Parkes, ASKAP, CHIME and UTMOST over 0.4\u20131.5GHz (Bhattacharyya et al. 2021). Here we extrapolated the fluences observed at higher frequencies to the MWA observing frequency of 185MHz for three different spectral index values of -1, -1.53 and -2 (the same range of spectral indices explored by Sokolowski et al. 2018) and include them in Table 3 where they can be compared to the fluence upper limits derived from our data. While low frequency bursts from FRB 20190116A and 20190213A were likely undetectable in the searchedMWAdatasets based on the assumed mean spectral index, bursts from the other repeaters may well be detectable if they were active during theMWAobservations. Although the scatter broadening of pulses can significantly reduce our sensitivity to FRB emission (as demonstrated by the large range of fluence upper limits shown in Table 3), our non-detection of low frequency bursts from the two brightest repeaters FRB 20190711A and 20201124A cannot be explained by scattering alone unless their spectral indices are \ud835\udefc & \u22121, which is consistent with the conclusion in Sokolowski et al. (2018).\nThere is another possibility that the spectrum of repeating FRBs needs to be generalised beyond a simple power law. This could be attributed to a low instantaneous bandwidth as has been observed for FRB 20121102A, 20180916B and 20190711A with a typical fractional bandwidth of \u223c 20% (Law et al. 2017; Gourdji et al. 2019; Majid et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021a) and/or clustering of spectra of repeat bursts as has been observed for FRB 20121102A (peaking around 1650MHz) and 20201124A (peaking around 650 and 500MHz; Aggarwal et al. 2021; Lanman et al. 2022). In the former case, the narrowband feature is similar to that observed for giant pulses from some pulsars (e.g. Geyer et al. 2021; Thulasiram & Lin 2021), and might hint at similarities in emission mechanisms between repeating FRBs and giant pulses."

            "text": "A low-frequency break in the spectrum of FRB emission is a plausible explanation for our non-detection. It has been suggested that free-free absorption by electrons in the circumburst environment can suppress low-frequency emission (Ravi & Loeb 2019; Rajwade et al. 2020a). Here we derive an upper limit on the size of a nebula that the repeater may be embedded in in the context of free-free absorption (e.g. Sokolowski et al. 2018).\nThe optical depth due to free-free absorption is given by\n\ud835\udf0fff =1.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u00d7 ( \ud835\udc47\n104K )\u22121.35 \u00d7 ( \ud835\udf08 185MHz )\u22122.1 \u00d7 DM 2 ex\n\ud835\udc53eff \ud835\udc3fpc ,\n(6)\nwhere \ud835\udc47 is the electron temperature, \ud835\udf08 is the observing frequency, \ud835\udc3fpc is the size of the absorbing material in pc, \ud835\udc53eff accounts for the volume filling correction, and DMex is the DM contribution from the absorbing material in pc cm\u22123 (Condon & Ransom 2016). DMex can be estimated by the DM values in excess of the Milky Way contributions in the directions of FRBs (Cordes & Lazio 2002) and a further Milky Way halo contribution of 15 pc cm\u22123 (Shannon et al. 2018).\nIf free-free absorption is responsible for the absence of low frequency emission, we can place a constraint on the size of the absorbing medium by requiring \ud835\udf0fff > ln(\ud835\udc39exp/\ud835\udc39lim), where \ud835\udc39exp is the expected fluence at the observing frequency for a spectral index of \u22121.53+0.29\u22120.19 (Bhattacharyya et al. 2021) and \ud835\udc39lim is the fluence upper limit derived from the MWA observation (see Table 3). In the case of minimum scattering, we find \ud835\udc53eff \ud835\udc3fpc < 1.00 \u00d7 (\ud835\udc47/104K)\u22121.35 pc (using \ud835\udc39exp = 106 Jyms), 0.92 \u00d7 (\ud835\udc47/104K)\u22121.35 pc (using \ud835\udc39exp = 837 Jyms) and [0.22\u20132.50] \u00d7 (\ud835\udc47/104K)\u22121.35 pc for FRB 20190117A, 20190711A, and 20201124A, respectively. Note that the fluence upper limits on the other two repeaters are not sufficient for constraining the size of their absorbing media.\nWe can compare our constraints on the size of an ionized nebula with those derived for other repeaters, such as FRB 20121102 and FRB 20180916B. The lowest frequency detection of FRB 20121102 was reported at 600MHz by CHIME (Josephy et al. 2019). However, a search for low-frequency emission from FRB 20121102 with LOFAR resulted in a fluence upper limit of 42 Jyms at 150MHz (Houben et al. 2019). If we adopt theDMvalue derived fromBalmer line measurements for the DM contribution from the host galaxy, DMhost . 324 pc cm\u22123 (Tendulkar et al. 2017), the size of the ionized region surrounding FRB 20121102 can be constrained to . 2.85 pc, which is comparable to the constraints derived above. Different than FRB 20121102 and the repeaters studied here, FRB 20180916B was reported to have low-frequency emission between 110\u2013188MHz, suggesting a lower limit on the size of an ionized nebula 0.16 \u00d7 (\ud835\udc47/104K)\u22121.35 pc (Pleunis et al. 2021a). If the population of repeating FRBs analysed here have a similar environment as FRB 20180916B, we would expect a nebula size of \u223c 1 pc, comparable to the Crab Nebula."

Here we present the first FRB search using MWA VCS observations. Compared to the imaging mode, the VCS data features a much higher time resolution, increasing our sensitivity to short duration (\u223cms) FRB emission which would otherwise be diluted by the 0.5 s coarse sampling of the standard correlator. Table 4 displays a comparison of the fluence sensitivity of our search with previous works. Note that while Tingay et al. (2015) and Rowlinson et al. (2016) performed a blind search for FRB emission in the wide field of view of the MWA, Sokolowski et al. (2018) specifically targeted the bright FRBs detected by ASKAP via a shadowing\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201312 (2022)\nobserving strategy. We can see the VCS observations used in this work demonstrate the best sensitivity. In the case of minimal scattering, the VCS observation is more than an order of magnitude more sensitive than the standard observation, and thus is most promising for searching for FRBs in the future."

            "text": "Considering the ongoing searches for FRBs with multiple different facilities, e.g., Parkes (Keane et al. 2018), ASKAP (Bannister et al. 2017), CHIME (CHIME/FRBCollaboration et al. 2018), UTMOST (Caleb et al. 2016) and FAST (Jiang et al. 2019), we expect more repeating FRBs to be discovered that can be observed by the MWA in the future. Since most FRBs are discovered by CHIME, here we focus on the prospect of CHIME repeating FRB follow-up using the MWA. At the location of MWA, we are able to observe only those FRBs with low declinations (. 30 deg), amounting to \u223c20% of the whole population based on the sky distribution of FRBs (see figure 10 in CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021b). Therefore, given that 18 repeating FRBs have been discovered by CHIME during its first year of operation (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019c; Fonseca et al. 2020b), we expect to be able to follow up \u223c 4 new repeating FRBs using the MWA per year assuming that the discovery rate is constant. Note that we would ideally target repeating FRBs that were away from the Galactic plane where the sky temperature is much higher, as well as choose those that show lower levels of scattering.\nA very interesting source among the population of repeating FRBs is FRB 20180916B, which features a periodicity of 16.3 day and low frequency emission detected by LOFAR in the frequency range of 110\u2013188MHz (Pleunis et al. 2021a), overlapping with the MWA observing band. Note that this FRB is unobservable by the MWA due to its location in the northern hemisphere. However, the fluences of the bursts from this repeater range between 26 to 308 Jyms and are therefore close to the fluence upper limits we derived from the MWAVCS observations studied in our analysis. It is therefore instructive to explore the detectability of these bursts by the MWA if they appeared in the MWA field of view. In Figure 2, we plot the pulse widths and fluences of the 18 detected bursts (black points) and the fluence upper limits derived from the MWA observations included in this work (blue region). Considering the sensitivity of the MWA observations in this work are limited by the low elevations of the targeted FRBs in the MWA field of view, we also plot a typical sensitivity near the zenith of the full MWA for comparison (Meyers et al. 2017, 2018; dashed red line). While the observations in this work would only have been sensitive enough to detect the seven brightest bursts, a typical VCS observation near the zenith could have detected up to 12 bursts, and therefore \u223c 70% of the bursts reported by Pleunis et al. (2021a) from the repeating FRB 20180916B at low frequencies (< 200MHz). Therefore, if another repeating source with emission properties similar to FRB 20180916B becomes known in the MWA sky in the future, followup campaigns with the MWA would be capable of detecting low frequency bursts.\nApart from follow-up observations of repeaters, we plan to conduct an all-sky FRB search with the MWA. Here we consider searching all the VCS archival data for FRBs. The rate of FRB detections by the MWA can be estimated using\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc391 \ud835\udf081 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc392 \ud835\udf082 = ( \ud835\udf081 \ud835\udf082 )\u2212\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefd \u00d7 ( \ud835\udc391 \ud835\udc392 )\ud835\udefd\u22121 , (7)\nwhere \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc391 \ud835\udf081 (\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc392 \ud835\udf082 ) is the sky rate above a fluence of \ud835\udc391 (\ud835\udc392) at a radio frequency of \ud835\udf081 (\ud835\udf082), \ud835\udefc is the average spectral index (\u22121.53+0.29\u22120.19; Bhattacharyya et al. 2021), and \ud835\udefd is the power-law index parameterizing the fluence distribution (\u22121.40 \u00b1 0.11+0.06\u22120.09; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021b). Here we adopted the latest sky rate of 820 \u00b1 60+220\u2212200 sky\n\u22121 day\u22121 for FRBs (including both repeaters and non-repeaters) with a fluence > 5 Jyms at 600MHz and a scattering time less than 10ms at 600MHz, which is based on the first large sample of FRBs (CHIME/FRBCollaboration et al. 2021b) and consistent with the rate reported from the Green Bank North Celestial Cap (GBNCC) survey in the 300\u2013400MHz band (Parent et al. 2020). Scaling this rate down to the MWA observing frequency of 185MHz and a typical VCS sensitivity of 50 Jyms as shown in Figure 2 using Eq. 7, we expect a rate of 15\u201378 sky\u22121 day\u22121. Given the \u223c 1% instantaneous sky coverage of the MWA (Tingay et al. 2013, 2015), we expect on average 1\u20137 days of VCS observations would yield an FRB detection. It is noteworthy that the computational cost of processing such a large amount of data is still a challenge (Trott et al. 2013)."

            "text": "In this paper, we have searched for low-frequency emission fromfive repeating FRBs using the VCS observations in the MWA archive. This is the first time that the MWA VCS has been used to search for bursts from repeating FRBs. The 25 MWA VCS observations analysed ranged in integration times between 15min and 1.5 hr (23.3 hr in total). As a result of this work, we come to the following main conclusions:\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201312 (2022)\n(i) If FRB 20190711A and FRB 20201124A were active during theMWA observations, then we can constrain their spectral index to \ud835\udefc & \u22121 assuming a broadband spectrum, shallower than the mean spectral index estimated on a sample of FRBs (Bhattacharyya et al. 2021). (ii) The fluence upper limits derived from the MWA observations in the case of minimum scattering on the FRB emission (contributed only by the Milky Way) enable us to constrain the size of the absorbing medium to < 1.00 \u00d7 (\ud835\udc47/104K)\u22121.35 pc, < 0.92\u00d7 (\ud835\udc47/104K)\u22121.35 pc and < [0.22\u20132.50] \u00d7 (\ud835\udc47/104K)\u22121.35 pc for FRB 20190117A, 20190711A, and 20201124A respectively, which is comparable to the size limit on FRB 20121102 (Tendulkar et al. 2017; Houben et al. 2019) and lower limit for FRB 20180916B (Pleunis et al. 2021a). (iii) Compared to previous MWA searches for low-frequency FRB emission using the standard correlator with a minimum temporal resolution of only 0.5 s (Tingay et al. 2015; Rowlinson et al. 2016; Sokolowski et al. 2018), our VCS observations with a temporal resolution of 400\u00b5s are more than an order of magnitude more sensitive to FRB signals except in the case of severe pulse broadening due to scattering beyond \u223c 0.5 s. (iv) A comparison between the typical sensitivity of the MWA VCS observation at the zenith and the fluences detected by LOFAR from FRB 20180916B reveals that the MWA would be able to detect \u223c 70% of the low frequency bursts from a repeater like FRB 20180916B.\nIn conclusion, our non-detections are likely due to the limited total integration time of our VCS observations, during which the repeaters were likely inactive. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a shallow spectrum or a dense environment. In order to detect the low-frequency counterparts of repeating FRBs or clearly constrain their burst properties, we need a combination of the reanalysis of archival VCS observations, which will continue to be collected over the duration of the SMART survey, and potentially dedicated VCS observing campaigns. Higher frequency instruments such as CHIME and ASKAP can be used to determine the active windows of repeating FRBs when targeted observations with the MWA will be most useful. Currently, the high time resolution dataset that covers a large part of the Southern Sky, which is only made possible via access to high time resolution data archives, presents a unique opportunity for transient science. Given this rich dataset, a blind search is a logical and efficient way of identifying low frequency FRBs and repeaters."
