    "abstractText": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from video data collections is the core application in vision tasks and has a variety of utilizations including object detection applications, video-based behavior monitoring, video classification, and indexing, patient monitoring, robotics, and behavior analysis. Although many techniques are available for HAR in video analysis tasks, most of them are not focusing on behavioral analysis. Hence, a new HAR system analysis the behavioral activity of a person based on the deep learning approach proposed in this work. The most essential aim of this work is to recognize the complex activities that are useful in many tasks that are based on object detection, modelling of individual frame characteristics, and communication among them. Moreover, this work focuses on finding out the human actions from various video resolutions, invariant human poses, and nearness of multi objects. First, we identify the key and essential frames of each activity using histogram differences. Secondly, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used in this system to extract coefficients from the sequence of key-frames where the activity is localized in space. Finally, an Adaptive Weighted Flow Net (AWFN) algorithm is proposed in this work for effective video activity recognition. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has been evaluated by comparing it with the existing Visual Geometry Group (VGG-16) convolution neural networks for making performance comparisons. This work focuses on competent deep learning-based feature extraction to discriminate the activities for performing the classification accuracy. The proposed model has been evaluated with VGG-16 using a combination of regular UCF-101 activity datasets and also in very challenging Low-quality videos such as HMDB51. From these investigations, it is proved that the proposed AWFN approach gives higher detection accuracy of 96%. It is approximately 0.3% to 7.88% of higher accuracy than state-of-art methods.",

            "text": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from videos is an important and challenging activity in the contemporary period the reason of the difficulty of intricate procedures used. Numerous investigations\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nhave been conceded out in research repositories on automated HAR. In general, object-based techniques are useful for the effective identification of human activities. Moreover, physical activities are performed based on movements and complex actions. Here the activities are also varying based on both the temporal-spatial dimensions. Different scenarios such as sensor-based, image-based and video-based techniques are widely used for the detection of human activity. In this work, a video processing-based scenario is performed in which HAR can be performed for distinguishing human actions. The methods used for HAR from the video features are classified into furnish and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Among them, the DL algorithm namely the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is mainly employed in image recognition problems as they use deep knowledge features. The number of layers in the design of DL-based classifiers is to decide using the application requirements. The main motivation of this activity detection is to detect human-object interaction, human-human interaction, body motion recognition, and sports activity recognition. It can be used in areas like sports, motion recognition and to know about the activities performed in videos.\nThe CNN draws out the deep-off features from every level using filters. Moreover, the CNN consists of several hidden layers and a normalized output layer. Since DL algorithms are efficient in image recognition and video analysis, they can be used in object-tracking applications in video analytics. In this approach, tracing is focusing on finding and creating the associations using the analysis of corrections among the frames. Conventional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms identify the important and most contributing features based on low-level correspondences. The analysis of the low-level correspondences is an important component in Feature Selection (FS) based on machine learning algorithms. In addition, DL algorithms are provided with many hidden layers that are specialized in the extraction and selection of many features. Here, the DL algorithms can identify the most contributing features from input video through their hidden layers [1\u20133]. One problem with the current classifiers is that they do not perform semantic analysis to get the semantically correct features. Therefore, existing DL algorithms must be enhanced to make them more suitable for HAR.\nA system developed for HAR using time and location constraints is a challenging task and hence, it is a type of time series classification problem. Therefore, the work proposed in this paper considers spatial and temporal constraints in the classification process. For accomplishing the analysis of the video data about HAR more accurately, this article proposes a spatial-temporal constraint-based method for solving the classification problem by extending the DL algorithm namely, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which is used for performing the optical flow analysis based on spatial-temporal features applied to form a new classification algorithm called Adaptive Weighted Flow Net based Long Short-Term Memory (AWFN-LSTM) algorithm. Moreover, the proposed AWFN-LSTM is a DL algorithm and it is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithm. As a result, it is well suited for handling temporal and geographical limitations. This proposed algorithm was implemented and tested using one regular UCF101 activity data set and low-quality videos, namely HMDB51. Moreover, we extracted the key and important frames from the video data for every human activity using the difference values from the histogram. In addition, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is employed in this proposed model for extracting the coefficients more accurately from the sequence of key-frames that were extracted from the video files. The major advantages of the proposed system are that it improves the classification and prediction accuracy when it is related to the other important deep learning systems namely VGG16 convolution neural networks and the CNN.\nThe proposed HAR system includes the following unique recommendations and contributions. The suggested method is a new contribution to this field because it uses a combination of deep learning and machine learning to perform spatial and temporal reasoning that accomplishes activity detection. In general, deep learning-based methods can handle uncertainty during detection. To tackle uncertainty during activity detection, the proposed wavelet-based VGG-16 with LSTM and AWFN uses the\nappropriate reasoning. The AWFN algorithm can detect human activities more precisely than traditional methods.\nThe rest of this present article is organized as follows: The second portion covers the existing and relevant work in the areas of human activity acknowledgement, feature assortment, and classification methods. Section 3 details the contributions of the proposed work. Section 4 depicts the results obtained from this work with suitable discussions. Section 5 derives the conclusions on this work and gives some possible future works."

            "text": "In recent times, many approaches were developed for HAR. In this scenario, multi-view HAR [4] has been projected as the important activity and it utilizes the geometrical features based on regions such as critical points, area, perimeter, orientation and hu-moments. It extracts a lot of features and they are used to find the activity.\nSeo et al. [5] proposed a new approach to reduce the complexity of optical flow measurement by implementing the dynamic frame bouncing method and motion interjection for efficient optical flow approximation. For that Trajectory Shapes (TS), HOG, HOF, and Motion Boundary Histograms (MBH) features were extracted and PCA was used for performing the descriptors reduction. They encoded the extracted features utilizing Fisher Vectors (FV) and the Sparse Representation Classification (SRC) was used in their work to differentiate the human activities. Their model increased the overall computational efficiency and provided high accuracy in the categorization of activities in the Olympic sports dataset by providing 95.3% accuracy. But still, some errors are found in their model due to the skipping of frames.\nUllah et al. [6] found and used the texture features of activity for extracting the significant facts and to create recognition using it. Their system extracts interesting regions by integrating object proposals and motion cues. The shape features were extracted using histograms and gist features were used for motion cues. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was a classifier that was used by these authors to recognize the activity more accurately. Here, the mid-level features were represented well and hence it has increased the recognition accuracy to 95.6%. However, the object proposal method they developed was computationally expensive with high time complexity. Zhao et al. [7] resolved the issue of human activity acknowledgement in low-level recordings. In their model, layered elastic-motion tracking was suggested to capture both long-term trajectories of motion and mutual shape. Hybrid feature depiction was used for cording both the motion and the shape features. Action classification is carried out effectively by the region mixture model and in which there was no necessity for segmentation. The shortcoming includes the encryption of the spatial outlines of the features. Peng et al. [8] worked on boosting the activity recognition performance using descriptor fusion. They developed BoW visual model for HAR as it provides effective acknowledgement based on actions acknowledgement. They carried out Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a feature reduction technique to ease the complexity. The k-means clustering algorithm and SV coding were applied to generate the codebook for feature encoding. The use of their model that descriptor fusion is used by them to increase the recognition accuracy to 88.12%. However, their model has a limitation while using the Bag of Words (BoW) method with visual features since it discards the temporal order information.\nElshourbagy et al. [9] prescribed to improve the BOW to get better exactness in human movement acknowledgement i.e., a bag of features. These features used are STIP detector, HOG, and HOF. With multilevel clustering and the SVM classifier, visual BOW created a code book to classify human actions. This method reduced not only the time but also the memory requirements and it achieved 95.6% of detection accuracy. However, it misidentified some of the basic activities by confusing the actions such as running and jogging.\nA new HAR system using background subtraction was projected in [10] to perform silhouette-based view-invariant activity identification. It was carried out by frame differencing method. Contour-based present highlights from outlines and uniform revolution invariant Local Binary Patterns (LBP) were acquainted in that framework with extricating the essentials. The actions were categorized via multiclass SVMs. One limitation of their model is that the update of the background model is not considered but it is very critical.\nWang et al. [11] implemented a model for HAR in which the path of action-based areas and motion information were captured by the optical-flow method. Their work improved the detection accuracy using shape features, HOG features, HOF features, and MBH features. It provided a very high computational cost but it achieved only 60% classification accuracy with the HMD51 dataset. It extracted spatial, and temporal action-related areas [12] and performed by implementing Interest Patch (IP) detector. The activity localization problem using HOG, Visual Background Extractor (ViBe) background subtraction method, and canny contour detector technique. Optical flow, pixel values, and gradients along with spatial SVM, and temporal IP distribution histograms were established in their model and final decisions were determined by the scores of these two SVMs. Here, the dictionary was trained separately and the accuracy obtained was 88.81%. The weakness of that work is the high memory requirements.\nIn video analytics, the deep-learned features are novel to solve many recognition, detection, and grouping problems. Yu et al. [13] proposed a different variation of CNN for HAR. Here, global-level extraction is carried out by frame-level feature extraction. PCA is applied for feature selection. It needs only a less labelled dataset for the training process and the advantage of this approach is the requirement of minimum training time. The hierarchical video illustration method discussed in [14] is contending with a DL classifier for performing the video analysis. The authors used CNN on video data and they also used LSTM for performing the action identification. One reward of this method is its ability to perform effective Feature Selection (FS) and the accuracy provided by this system is 90.8%. The primary disadvantage of their CNN approach is high calculation intricacy. Zhu et al. [15] suggested a structural activity model that is integrating the context activity features namely intra, inter-activity and finally the motion features namely Spatial-Temporal Interest Points (STIP), Optical-Flow using Histogram (HOF) and Oriented Gradients using Histogram (HOG). In their model, a greedy search algorithm was used to label all the activities found in the video. Acknowledgement was finished utilizing the Bag of Words (BOW) examination with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for arrangement. Though their model is considering various features for enhancing the accuracy of recognition, it fails to address the inter-activity motion regions. Uninterrupted emotion recognition [16] is achieved using a 3D model. But it is very complex to build a three-dimensional model for each action.\nChen et al. [17] presented a multi-view activity identification system in which descriptors from distinct views were combined to create a new enhanced feature that contained the transition between the different views [18,19]. Here, actions were identified utilizing facial emotion. Gorelick et al. [20] used a bag of features scheme combined with late fusion. The lack of intrinsic visual relationship estimates limits the recognition challenge, even though their system performs well in recognizing human contact. For recognizing human interactions in TV shows, multi-view HAR system was developed by mapping action information from numerous camera perspectives into one, and a non-linear-based knowledge transfer approach using DL was presented. Dalal et al. [21] were able to distinguish between human activities by applying the histograms and SVM was deployed for classification i.e., action grouping. Using the density of all features [22] observed, Guha et al. [23] performed HAR by linking the context between interest locations. It motivated on three major topics i.e., the intention of a classifier, data modelling, and FS for activity recognition [24].\nCNN has exposed countless achievements in recent years and attained high-tech act on numerous jobs (e.g., [25\u201328], etc.). In the literature, there have been numerous proposals for HAR using deep learning techniques [29]. Recently DL [30] has approaches that have had a significant impact on an extensive range of training fields, together with video and image comprehension, speech acknowledgement, and biomedical image analysis. It learns the optical-flow features [31,32] in different approaches in CNN and it achieves good results in recognition. Initially, CNN was used to perform image classification tasks. Later they were also used to perform video analytics [33,34]. The CNN was able to handle dislocations effectively. Recent works on CNN include relocations, deep-flow [35], and epic-flow [36] handling. DLbased algorithms such as flow net and its variants [37] were employed for analyzing optical flow [38,39]. However, the work on deep features flow was considered in performing the analysis. Lite flow net [40] is made up of two small sub-networks that specialize in extracting pyramidal features and estimating optical flow. When compared with related methods, this technique can fetch the characteristics faster. Flow net [41], flow net 2.0, lite flow net, capsule networks [42], and spy net have investigated optical flow estimation Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Likewise, with a small network, spy net utilizes spatial pyramids, to ensure that the spatial features are useful in data analysis. Nguyen et al. [43] used capsule structures as a classifier, and the results were noticeably better than CNN-based GANs. Moreover, capsule networks are being expanded into the analysis of videos. A technique for collecting from capsule networks was proposed by Zhu et al. As a result, it is not necessary to employ a multi-scale strategy. For estimating optical flow, some methods employ extra tools such as outward edge detectors or images to bring up-to-date associations. Xu et al. [44] used this capsule in gait recognition. For estimating the performance of HAR via two datasets namely UCF101 [45] and HMDB-51 [46]. The convolutional capsule layers and neural networks [47,48] were elaborate during learning. Layers of compartment pooling are used to aid action recognition [49\u201353]. These models are vastly different from our approach [54\u201356]. Few other works are also available in the literature that discusses the use of deep learning algorithms in different applications [57\u201360]. The major works from the literature survey are compared in Table 1.\nBased on the literature survey carried out in this work, it is observed that an increased number of redundant features, low accuracies, and higher computational complexities are the major issues to be addressed. In addition to this, the computationally expensive algorithms are not able to recognize the similarity between the actions efficiently. To overcome the limitations of the systems present in the existing literature, computationally efficient systems are needed for identifying the key-frames and accurate activity recognition. The difficulty that occurred in the identification of frames is resolved in this work by introducing an efficient key frame detection technique.\nThe following are the primary contributions of this work:\nTo apply the improved form of the VGG-16 algorithm for the precise identification of human activity. To develop a wavelet-based VGG-16 with LSTM for the effective sequential learning of features for the detection of activity.\nTo propose an AWFN algorithm for making an optical flow prediction capability during HAR. The performance measures such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall have all been used to illustrate the proposed system\u2019s effectiveness. It has also been demonstrated that the AWFN provides more detection accuracy than the current systems. The premise is that the suggested wavelet-based VGG16 with LSTM and AWFN algorithm is possible to accurately detect human behaviors. The initial hypothesis is achieved in this case by adding feature correlation to the softmax classifier to increase its accuracy in differentiating similar activities. The system was trained and tested using 70% of the data (frames) for training and 30% of the data (frames) for testing.\nIn deep learning, a large number of learnable parameters are included in VGG-16 to differentiate the actions. It learns all the features including shape, texture, boundaries, inter and intra-class similarity. The hybridization of LSTM with VGG-16 enhances the performance of activity detection with reduced complexity. LSTM has a larger range of parameters such as learning rate and input-output bias. Here, the fine adjustments of parameters are not needed. To effectively handle the redundant features, high-level feature correlation is added after the convolution layer in the proposed AWFN."

We employed the haar wavelet filter to decompose the dynamic picture in the suggested system and it is developed for feature detection.

The motion features are applied instead of pool frame-level features to get the final video feature. We combined two-stream features by fusing concatenation. The results of the AWFN model on UCF101 are mentioned in Fig. 5.\nThe training and testing are split for the two distinct datasets such as UCF-101 and HMDB-51 are specified in Table 2a. Table 2b shows the motion segmentation and recognition comparison of extracted objects. F-measure, accuracy, precision, and recall is described in Table 3b, and for a few activity class. The comparison with other modules is examined in Table 4.\nThe extraction of objects from the KFs and their performance during activity detection for the literature and proposed methods are tabulated in Table 2b. In this, the proposed AWFN extracted 38 objects out of 65 objects in frames leading to offering higher action recognition power of 89.51%. This is approximately 8.72% to 24.24% higher recognition power as compared to the techniques used in related work for object extraction during activity recognition.\nThe precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy of the proposed technique during distinct activity recognition are specified in Table 3b. In this, the archery action offered higher precision of 95.05%, and applying eye makeup offered a lower precision value of 84.66% as compared with other actions. This precision value offered how likely this proposed method detects the correct action. In the same manner, the recall value is also computed to identify the number of correctly identified actions divided by the total\nnumber of action inputs mentioned in sensitivity. Here, the baby crawling action has a higher recall value of 95.89% and applying eye makeup secured a lower recall value of 90.85%. The confusion matrix for the results is shown in Table 3a.\nIn Table 3b, for different actions, f1-score is computed by identifying the geometric mean value between positive predictions and recall. Based on the f1-score value, the activity of baby crawling offered higher recognition power of 95.37% whereas the action applied eye makeup received a lower recognition rate of 87.64%. Likewise, the accuracy of AR is higher for band marching and lower for applying lipstick. Anyway, the mean accuracy of the proposed technique is improved significantly. The accuracy of the proposed wavelet-based VGG-16 with LSTM and using AWFN detected key frames offered 96% of accuracy. This is significantly higher accuracy as compared with previous literature. The comparison of already existing AR-based literature with the proposed technique is given in Table 4.\nFrom the work carried out on classification seen that on temporal stream, AWFN outperforms the VGG16+LSTM method by 1.0% on the UCF101 (88.8% vs. 89.8%). On the spatial stream, AWFN outpaces wavelet-based VGG-16 with the LSTM network by 1.5%. The results reveal that wavelet-based VGG16 with LSTM+AWFN architecture can achieve higher recognition accuracy with fewer parameters (1.01 to Million). Fig. 6 presents the accuracy analysis performed between the CNN and the proposed CNN with spatio-temporal features.\nFrom Fig. 6, it is seen that software testing with VGG+LSTM was better by considering the standard datasets available. Fig. 7 depicts the accuracy analysis of wavelet-based VGG-16+LSTM with the related algorithms on single activity classes.\nFrom this analysis, it is seen that the proposed CNN-based DL algorithm provides better classification accuracy than the related work. Fig. 8, depicts the accuracy comparison performance of AWFN with and without a keyframe. In this, the AWFN with keyframe provided better accuracy for all activity classes. The analysis of various activity detection using four distinct algorithms is depicted in Fig. 9. From this, this proposed wavelet-based VGG-16 with LSTM for AWFN key frames offered peak accuracies for all of the activity classes.\nIn the proposed system, the performance has been analyzed by testing the test divided into images. Moreover, True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN) values are evaluated by analyzing the actual and predicted class label which in terms contributes to the evaluation of accuracy in Eq. (9). MATLAB was used here to extract KF\u2019s from the video. With python, we found the motion trajectories using the haar wavelet. Approximation of object-based frame digs out from the KF by applying a low-frequency filter. Flow-based trajectory path expanded using VGG-16, VGG-16+LSTM and AWFN are depicted in Fig. 1.\nAccuracy \u00bc TP\u00fe TN P\u00fe N (9)\nFb \u00bc 1\u00fe b2 : precision recall\nb precision\u00fe recall (10)\nOn certain test splits, this approach was used. By looking at our technique, we can see that the standard fscore is the only metric that is meant to use accuracy and recall in the calculation Eq. (9). We calculated pixelwise accuracy and recall values to estimate the area overlap. TP\u2019s and FP\u2019s concepts are used to determine precision and recall (PR) levels. The f-score range from 0 to 1, where the f-score number for an exact approach should be high. It is a subset of the universal f_measure based on Eq. (10). The suggested CNN-based model outperforms the previous works on several occasions, as shown in these figures.\nThe comparison with state of art methods analyzed from 2016 to 2022 is tabulated in Table 4. In this, the methods used for analyzing human activity along with their accuracies are mentioned. Machine learning (ML) algorithms such as SVM, ELM, and SRC are widely used for activity detection. These algorithms are a lower ability to handle the non-linear features extracted from activity-based images. Therefore, all the ML algorithms are less stable for activity recognition. Now a day, deep learning-based algorithms such as 2D CNN, 3D CNN, LSTM, MSD, EfficientDetD7, MA-Net, and VGG-16 are used for activity recognition. The usage of a larger number of layers in deep learning algorithms performed well during activity recognition. As compared with the state-of-art methods the proposed AWFN methods offered a higher activity recognition rate of 96% due to its accurate activity features pattern recognition ability."

            "text": "The proposed HAR technique integrated the complex activities which usually require tasks namely object detection, and modelling of individual frame features. Initially, key frames are identified that offered higher recognition power as compared without the use of keyframe selection during HAR recognition. To compute the features, we proposed a wavelet-based optical flow technique that minimizes the action recognition error. Finally, learning algorithms such as the softmax layer of VGG-16, LSTM, flow-net, and AWFN are used in which AWFN offered higher prediction power during HAR. Based on performance results AWFN offered 96% accuracy as compared with existing literature. It is approximately 0.3% to 7.88% higher accuracy than existing methods. However, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is the same as that of the base algorithm present in the literature namely VGG16 algorithm. In future work, multiple-view information will be gathered for the detection of a group of activities. In the future, our goal is to test several pre-trained CNNs with rules for better functioning on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets. To offer a better classifier to improve activity recognition, multiactivity can be seen in many orientations.\nAcknowledgement: We would also like to show our gratitude to professor Dr A.
