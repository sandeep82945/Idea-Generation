            "text": "The concept of community nursing was first put forward in 1970, and described as the combination of public health and nursing work [1]. The district or community nurse is central to the healthcare of community residents [2]. Currently, community nursing work in China covers basic therapeutic care (70%) and public health services (30%) [3], such as inpatient and outpatient care, preventive healthcare, maternal and child healthcare, chronic disease management, health education, and family nursing [4]. The complexity of the community nursing working environment and the diversity of services creates higher requirements in terms of the knowledge and abilities of community nurses [5]. To meet the requirements of their job, community nurses need to provide high-quality mental and physical healthcare services, and also need to maintain the necessary emotional communication with service recipients to achieve performance satisfaction [6]. To understand patients\u2019 experiences and support relationships with patients, relatives, and colleagues, community nurses use emotional labor and control their emotional expressions [7]. Emotional labor is the third kind of labor after physical and mental labor, and refers to the process of psychological adjustment necessary to express the emotions expected by an organization [8]. Nurses should know and control the process required for managing their emotions and expressions [9]. Excessive emotional labor can cause mental health problems [10], musculoskeletal symptoms [11], cardiovascular disease [12], and other physical health problems [13]. Although emotional labor is an important part of nursing practice, it is usually invisible, neglected and under estimated [14]. And even literature shows that emotional labor exists across a broad spectrum of nursing work [15], only few researches on conditions and related factors of community nurses\u2019 emotional labor is available [16\u201318], and this topic remains to be investigated.\nWith the expansion of the scope of community nursing and improvement in quality\nrequirements, the psychological pressure on community nurses has increased [19], along with issues associated with professional satisfaction [20] and career success [21]. Career success refers to the gradual accumulation or acquisition of work-related achievements and positive feelings by individuals throughout their work experience, including remuneration, promotion, recognition, and acceptance [22]. A previous study among nurses indicated that the process of applying emotional labor aimed to achieve organizational goals and improve nurses\u2019 salary, promotion opportunities, and recognition [23]. Previous studies have shown that emotional labor strategies have significant predictive effects on job stress, job satisfaction, and subjective job performance [24]. Researchers also found that nurses\u2019 career success was mainly affected by emotional labor [25]. How about the relationship between career success and emotional labor in community nurses is need to be explored.\nEmotional labor is the multi-level and dynamic essence of emotional regulation [26], and\nincludes surface acting (e.g., concealing negative emotion with a fake smile), deep acting (e.g., taking a positive and optimistic approach to eliminate negative emotions and conform to the requirements of the organization), and natural expression dimensions (e.g., the true expression of one\u2019s emotions in accordance with work requirements) [27]. The effect of emotional labor is the result of the mixed effect of these dimensions [28]. Previous research on emotional labor in nursing mainly centered on the degree of total and each dimension of emotional labor or their relationship with other occupational factors, and the results did not clarify the specific situation and characteristics of emotional labor for an individual [24,29,30]. Therefore, even if the scores for emotional labor measurement were consistent, internal heterogeneity could not be determined [31]. To solve this problem, it is necessary to use an individual-centered research method to analyze the heterogeneity of emotional labor among community nurses. Latent class analysis (LCA) focuses on the heterogeneity of individuals, and the latent class\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268188 May 5, 2022 2 / 14\nFunding: The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nclassification of individuals can be determined according to the response pattern of an individual in the detection questions; this means the number and proportion in each category can be clarified [32]. Therefore, the level and internal characteristics of emotional labor of community nurses are a research issue that needs further discussion. Analysis of the potential categories of emotional labor among community nurses (from surface variable analysis to internal characteristic analysis) and the relationship between the level of emotional labor and the sense of career success were taken based on LCA. The results may be valuable for improving the emotional labor among community nurses, which may provide scientific data for improving the quality of community nursing services and promoting career success and team stability."

Considering the possibility of a 10% sample loss (n = 35), the final sample size for this study was calculated at 385 community nurses. We recruited community nurses from 11 community health service centers in four districts in Beijing using convenience sampling. The inclusion criteria were nursing staff: (1) with a nurse\u2019s certificate; (2) pass the community nurse on-the-job training prescribed by health administrative department of province or city; (3) that had worked in the participating community health institutions for\ufffd1 year and (4) that provided informed consent for voluntary participation. Exclusion criteria were: (1) nurses that had returned to work after sick or casual leave<1 year previously; (2) nursing managers; (3) student nurses; and (4) nursing staff who were going to retire within 3 months."

Responses are on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). A higher score indicates a higher level of emotional labor. In the present study, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the scale was 0.776.\nThe CSS [35] was developed from the career satisfaction scale. A Chinese version was developed by Li Ya [36]. The 21 questionnaire items are divided into four dimensions: career development (five questions), freedom and happiness (five questions), gain recognition (six questions), and international network (five questions). Responses are on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree), with a total possible score of 105. The higher the score, the more likely the respondent is to be satisfied and successful. In the present study, the Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the scale was 0.951."

Count data were described by frequency composition ratio, and data with a normal distribution were described by mean\u00b1standard deviation. Mplus version 7.0 was used to analyze the potential categories of emotional labor. Mplus software was developed by Linda Muthen and Bengt Muthen in 1998 and It is the most popular and powerful latent variable analysis software at present [37]. LCA model fit test indices included: Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), accommodated BIC, entropy value, Lo-Mendell Rubin (LMR) test, and bootstrap likelihood ratio test (BLRT) [38]. Smaller AIC and BIC values indicate a better simulation fit. Entropy ranges from 0 to 1, and represent the accuracy of model classification; entropy\ufffd0.8 indicates that the classification accuracy exceeds 90%. In addition, the fit differences of potential category models can also be determined by LMR and BLRT, and p-values <0.05 indicated the differences were statistically significant. The establishment of the optimal model considered the adaptation index and existing research and the interpretability of data results [39]. After the optimal model was chosen, the differences in sociodemographic variables in each class allocation were obtained using chi-squared tests. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the influence of a sense of career success on classification of emotional labor. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "This study used LCA to explore patterns of emotional labor among community nurses in China. The LCA method minimizes the differences within a category and maximizes the differences between categories and classifies group characteristics from the perspective of individuals; this approach clearly reveals difference between different heterogeneous individuals within the group [40,41]. Notably, we found there were distinct classifications of emotional labor in community nurses. The LCA results identified a 3-class model: class 1 = active group (n = 90, 25.6%), class 2 = apathetic group (n = 65, 18.5%), and class 3 = moderate group (n = 197, 55.9%).\nThe total mean emotional labor score was 3.51\u00b10.49, which was higher than the medium critical value of 3.00 using the Likert scale 5-point scoring method [42]. This suggested that the emotional labor among community nurses was at a high level. It has also been reported that nurses\u2019 emotional labor is maintained at a medium to high level, such as in emergency treatment [43], the intensive care unit [44], and the neonatal ward [45]. Bolton [46] suggested that nursing is one of the occupations most commonly associated with extensive emotional work. Smith [47] highlighted that the nursing process (a framework for planning and implementing nursing care) involves person-centered rather than task-oriented care. With the increasing\ndemand for high-quality healthcare service, medical organizations have emphasized provision of healthcare that centers on patients\u2019 needs. Furthermore, whether in the hospital or in the community, nurses need to comfort critically ill patients and their families, help them deal with illness correctly, and remove psychological barriers. All of which require the ability to exercise emotional labor. Thus, nurses\u2019 emotional labor is recognized as an integral part of patient care [17,48].\nCommunity nurses in the active class displayed the highest total emotional labor score for\nall items except item 3 (\u201cI put on a \u2018show\u2019 or \u2018performance\u2019 when interacting with customers\u201d). In particular, item 10 (\u201cI work at developing the feeling inside of me that I need to show to customers\u201d) showed the highest score. Most nurses agreed they overcame negative emotions at work, got along with others in a friendly way, and used deep acting emotional labor strategies, which means to keep inner feelings consistent with their displayed expression, instead of fake acting at work [49]. They may excel at actively regulating internal emotions and actively change to promote self-action, resulting in behavior consistent with organizational expectations [50]. Conversely, community nurses in the apathetic class displayed the lowest score for all items and the highest score of item 3. The highest score of item 3 in this class, may indicated that the apathetic class tended to use more fake emotions in work situations. They tried to hide their real emotional and facial expressions and show the emotion they expected to consisted with organization demand. Low emotional labor score may indicated that individuals in the apathetic class presented negative emotional manifestations and behaviors. Researchers found that emotional labor is usually stressful and has an adverse effect on nurses\u2019 psychological wellbeing and health, when emotions that are not genuinely felt have to be conveyed [51]. An overview of the effects of this disguise on the health revealed effects ranging from burnout and fatigue to dysmenorrhea, disruptions in sleep patterns and suicidal tendencies [52]. We also found the lowest scores were for item 8 (\u201cI try to actually experience the emotions that I must show to customers\u201d) and Item 11 (\u201cI work at developing the feeling inside of me that I need to show to customers\u201d). Both of these items showed that nurses in the apathetic class did not want to \u201ctry to\u201d or \u201cdevelop\u201d organizationally desired emotion expression during interpersonal transactions. A study found that if employees can actively internalize and integrate emotional performance norms and regard themselves as an important part of their work, their level of emotional labor motivation will be higher [53]. And previous researchers suggested to intervene by improving higher job autonomy, giving higher organizational identity and more support from superiors and colleagues to lower probability of mood disorders [8]. Class 3 was labeled the moderate group, the scores for emotional labor were in the middle range and the curves were basically the same as those for the active class. Previous studies proposed that financial rewards, genuine emotional expression and the maintenance of positive emotions, can make up for the mental resources consumed by emotional labor [54,55]. Grandey\u2019s study proved that employees in the supportive work environment of superiors and colleagues are more likely to have the tendency to conform to the expected emotion, and have the real emotional feelings of negative individuals to negative events [50]. Therefore, adjusting personal emotions and improving organizational management would be helpful to improve the enthusiasm of emotional labor of Class 2 and Class 3.\nOur results showed significant differences in occupation characteristics between the three classes (Table 3). Community nurses\u2019 emotional labor was positively correlated with their job title, job contents, workplace, sense of job satisfaction, working relationships, career interest, and development [56]. Previous studies found that experienced workers have more mature emotional management skills [57]. Compared with a community health service center, health service stations have a smaller jurisdiction and population size, less contact between nurses and patients, lower workloads, and fewer interpersonal relationships to deal with. Therefore,\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268188 May 5, 2022 9 / 14\nthey are relatively prone to a negative emotional labor state [58]. Mro\u0301z et al. investigated working emotion among 55 employees and showed that positive emotional labor improved employees\u2019 job satisfaction [59]. A study reported that servers who expressed real smiles (didn\u2019t feel \"false\") at work, had more job satisfaction than those who reported faking emotions [60]. A study by Li Yongxin et al. [61] also showed positive relationship between active emotional labor and career interest. Previous studies also found that the degree of professional identity and job autonomy of nurses will affect their emotional labor ability [8,62,63]. Our study indicated that the active class of community nurses had the highest sense of career success, followed by the moderate class and then the apathetic group, and the gaining recognition dimension showed significant differences in the three classes. A study on preschool teachers also mentioned a link between emotional labor and a sense of career success [64]. Recognition refers to recognizing or paying special attention to employees\u2019 actions, efforts, behaviors, and performance, which is an important form of incentive for employees [65]. Herzberg\u2019s two-factor theory suggests that incentives can produce a sense of achievement, identity, and responsibility [66]. Yu\u2019s study also showed that professional identity, emotional labor, and job performance were positively correlated [67]. Above all, out study suggested to pay attention to employees\u2019 emotional labor skills training, negative emotions management and policy support and technical guidance provision to help boost positive emotions at work, which in turn increases job satisfaction and career success."
