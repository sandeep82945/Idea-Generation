 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the systematic review:

1. Conduct large-scale studies with standardized methodologies to validate the diagnostic accuracy of different AI architectures for lung cancer detection. The review highlighted the need for larger studies with consistent evaluation metrics.

2. Compare the performance of deep learning versus traditional machine learning models on the same lung cancer imaging datasets. The review suggested deep learning holds promise but requires more data, while machine learning was effective with smaller datasets. 

3. Develop optimal feature extraction and selection techniques to improve the sensitivity and specificity of AI algorithms for lung cancer diagnosis. The review showed variability in diagnostic performance based on the features used.

4. Evaluate the impact of AI-assisted lung cancer diagnosis on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes through randomized controlled trials. The review did not examine downstream effects of AI implementation.

5. Perform cost-effectiveness analyses of integrating AI into lung cancer screening and diagnosis pathways in clinical settings. The review did not address the economic impacts of AI adoption.
