    "abstractText": "Iron-based SMAs can be used in the medical field for both their shape memory effect (SME) and biodegradability after a specific period, solving complicated chirurgical problems that are partially now addressed with shape-memory polymers or biodegradable polymers. Iron-based materials with (28\u201332 wt %) Mn and (4\u20136 wt %) Si with the addition of 1 and 2 wt % Ag were obtained using levitation induction melting equipment. Addition of silver to the FeMnSi alloy was proposed in order to enhance its antiseptic property. Structural and chemical composition analyses of the newly obtained alloys were performed by X-ray diffraction (confirming the presence of \u03b5 phase), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The corrosion resistance was evaluated through immersion tests and electrolyte pH solution variation. Dynamic mechanical solicitations were performed with amplitude sweep performed on the FeMnSi\u20131Ag and FeMnSi\u20132Ag samples, including five deformation cycles at 40 \u25e6C, with a frequency of 1 Hz, 5 Hz and 20 Hz. These experiments were meant to simulate the usual behavior of some metallic implants subjected to repetitive mechanical loading. Atomic force microscopy was used to analyze the surface roughness before and after the dynamic mechanical analysis test followed by the characterization of the surface profile change by varying dynamic mechanical stress. Differential scanning calorimetry was performed in order to analyze the thermal behavior of the material in the range of \u221250\u2013+200 \u25e6C. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) along with Neaspec nano-FTIR experiments were performed to identify and confirm the corrosion compounds (oxides, hydroxides or carbonates) formed on the surface.",

            "text": "The field of biodegradable alloys has been a very common theme in scientific studies over time. Researchers have addressed many directions in the study of biocompatibility associated with mechanical properties and corrosion rates to reach the right combination needed in the healing process of diseased tissues [1]. Temporary biodegradable implants used in medical applications must provide mechanical support for a certain period during healing and degrade after the tissue has been remodeled [2].\nJ. Funct. Biomater. 2023, 14, 377. https://doi.org/10.3390/jfb14070377 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jfb\nJ. Funct. Biomater. 2023, 14, 377 2 of 21\nFe\u2013Mn-based alloys have been studied under different aspects, showing good biocompatibility properties [3], mechanical strength [4] and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility, i.e., non-magnetism due to the austenitic phase [5]. Alloying with Si has led to shape memory properties very useful in the design of potential medical implants, such as stents for cardiological applications [6], and increased corrosion rate [7]. Mn and Si are non-toxic and essential elements in the mammalian body responsible for its proper functioning [8\u201311]. Fe\u2013Mn\u2013Si alloys with Mn content between 25 and 30 wt % possess mechanical properties close to those of stainless steel [6,12,13] and the biomechanical compatibility required for bone implants [14,15]. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are well known for their properties such as superelasticity and the ability to recover a memorized shape upon the action of a stimulus [16]. The best known biocompatible SMAs are NiTi-based ones [17] with excellent mechanical properties, used as permanent implants. What is related to this type of implant are the medical complications that may occur in the long term, requiring additional surgery [18]. In some applications where the temporary presence of non-degradable biocompatible alloys is required, further surgery may also be required for removal, which could affect the patient\u2019s health [19]. The design of biodegradable SMAs would lead to facilitating the healing process, providing mobility in some specific applications, remodeling and healing the diseased tissue so that no further surgery is required afterward [20,21]. Based on its excellent formability, low manufacturing cost, biocompatibility and biodegradability in physiological environment as reported by in vitro studies investigating Fe\u2013Mn\u2013Si alloy as SMA as well as its biodegradability in physiological environment, a biodegradable Fe-based SMA could be a suitable candidate for temporary implants [22\u201326]. Due to the rather low corrosion rates of Fe-based alloys, which are intended to be improved [27,28], the technique of alloying with noble elements such as Au, Pt, Pd and Ag has been used, which has led to increased corrosion rates through micro-galvanic corrosion due to the potential differences observed between the matrix that acted as the anode and phases containing precipitates of the noble metals [29\u201331]. The choice of Ag for alloying was due to its well-known antimicrobial properties [32]. Ag is used in medical devices as an antibiotic, interacting with the human body [33]. Studies indicate that Ag absorbed by the human body is eliminated through natural pathways by the kidneys and liver [34]. By alloying Fe with Ag, a new biodegradable alloy was produced for further studies, thus it was reported that a microstructure was formed in which Ag particles are dispersed in the Fe matrix, as Ag is known to be immiscible in Fe [35]. Niendorf et al. [36] observed that, in the TWIP\u20135Ag alloy (Fe\u2013Mn-based), due to the potential difference, the Ag phase and the Fe matrix formed a galvanic couple leading to increased degradation rate and insignificant changes in mechanical properties compared to the basic Ag-free TWIP alloy. In the experiments conducted on biodegradable Fe\u2013Mn\u2013Ag alloys, Liu et al. [37] reported for Fe70.3\u201328.9Mn\u20130.8Ag alloy lower magnetic susceptibility and an increase in the corrosion rate compared to Fe\u201330Mn without Ag content. Tonna et al. [38] studied Fe, Fe35Mn and (Fe35Mn)5Ag samples in Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with and without Ca2+ and reported that (Fe35Mn)5Ag had the highest corrosion current density in HBSS containing Ca2+, concluding that the addition of Ag leads to an accelerated corrosion rate in the electrolyte that is most representative for orthopedic products. In the second part of the same study, Wang et al. [39] performed corrosion tests. They reported that the addition of 5 wt % Ag to the FeMn alloy created micro-galvanic couplings between the austenitic FeMn matrix and the Ag phase. These couplings served as effective cathodic sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that produced quantities of OH, favoring the deposition of Ca\u2013P products on the metal surface that stabilized the local pH. Sotoudeh Bagha et al. [40] used mechanical alloying and Spark Plasma Sintering to obtain different microstructures, namely, nano, macro and bimodal in Fe\u201330Mn\u2013(1-3)Ag alloys. The results showed better mechanical properties and a higher corrosion rate (0.88 mm/yr) for the bimodal Fe\u201330Mn\u20131Ag alloy [40]. In another study, Sotoudeh Bagha et al. [41] ob-\nJ. Funct. Biomater. 2023, 14, 377 3 of 21\ntained promising results for the alloys with Ag addition compared to Fe\u2013Mn alloy without Ag content, regarding increased hardness and ultimate shear strength of Fe-30Mn\u20131Ag (156 HV, 360 MPa) and Fe\u201330Mn\u20133Ag (174 HV, 490 MPa). In addition, Fe-30Mn\u20131Ag showed promising antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. Babacan et al. [42] conducted a study on Fe\u201330Mn\u20136Si, Fe30Mn\u20136Si\u20130.6Ag and Fe\u201330Mn\u20136Si\u20131.2Ag (wt %) alloys, where they reported higher mechanical strength values and faster degradation in simulated body fluid (SBF) than 316 L stainless steel and Fe\u201330Mn alloy. Increasing Ag content led to higher hardness which was explained by the increased amount of observed \u03b5 hexagonal close-packed (hcp)-martensite. In vitro experiments are performed by immersing samples in physiological solutions, which are more or less aggressive aqueous media (e.g., Ringer\u2019s solution, Hank\u2019s solution, Simulated Body Fluid (SBF)) [4,6,10,23]. The corrosion mechanism of titanium dioxide nanotubes in Ringer\u2019s solution was studied by Zarebidaki [43] and Chelliah studied the evaluation of electrochemical impedance and biocorrosion characteristics of as-cast and T4 heat-treated AZ91 Mg alloys in Ringer\u2019s solution [44]. To preserve the mechanical integrity of the implant, damage should start extremely slowly and then increase at the same rate as the body\u2019s natural healing process. It takes 6 to 12 months to complete the remodeling procedure when significant medical problems are involved. It is essential to note that iron degradation should not occur at a rate that leads to excessive deposits of degradation products around the implantation site. Kinetic factors influence corrosion rates, while thermodynamic aspects influence corrosion behavior [45]. Chloride ions found in physiological fluids, such as blood and interstitial fluid, play a major role in determining the degree of metal corrosion in living organisms [46]. In actual circumstances, a human body fluid\u2019s pH varies slightly and serves as a buffer solution. A pH of 7.3 to 7.45 is considered normal for blood and interstitial fluids, while it might reduce in close proximity to protein isoelectric points and surface implantation sites [46]. For porous iron created with additives in SBF solution, Sharma et al. [47] examined the pH increase during a 28-day period. The results established a pH range of 0.50 to 0.05 in the sample. The degree of corrosion kinetics and the degradation process are influenced by specific characteristics, including surface film state and environmental factors (such as pH and flow rate). The Pourbaix diagram and Pilling\u2013Bedworth ratio both show these aspects [48]. The partial anodic reaction (metal dissolution) is the first reaction that occurs upon contact of the metal with the physiological medium (Equations (1) and (2)) [49]. Performing in vitro immersion tests in Hank\u2019s solution, Dargusch et al. [50] demonstrated that Mn in the Fe layer appears in two valence states, Mn+2 and Mn+3, as demonstrated by XPS investigation. Mn(OH)2, Mn(OOH), and Mn2O3 were found to be present. Mn can be oxidized through reaction (2) when Fe is present.\nFe\u2192 Fe+2 + 2e\u2212, (1)\nMn\u2192Mn+2 + 2e\u2212, (2)\nWhen iron corrodes, the rate is usually controlled by the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (Equation (3)) [51]:\n2H2O + O2 + 4e\u2212 \u2192 4OH\u2212, (3)\nIron hydroxide (Fe(OH)2) or hydrating iron oxide (FeO\u00b7nH2O) are produced when metal ions are released and react with hydroxyl ions (Equation (4)) [52]:\nFe+2 + 2OH\u2212 \u2192 Fe(OH)2, (4)\nJ. Funct. Biomater. 2023, 14, 377 4 of 21\nFeO\u00b7nH2O or Fe(OH)2 are always in the adjacent layer to the metal interface when corrosion occurs. Ferrous oxides (Fe2+) are subsequently transformed to hydrous ferric oxide (Fe3+) or ferric hydroxide at the outside of the hydroxide layer due to the presence of dissolved oxygen [51], as shown in Equation (5):\nFe(OH)2 + 1/2H2O + 1/4O2 \u2192 Fe(OH)3, (5)\nFe hydroxides may also take the Fe oxide forms of hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and wustite (FeO), according to Hermawan et al.\u2019s research [52]. They also claimed that corrosion pitting might occur when chloride ions (Cl\u2212) react with iron ions through an autocatalytic mechanism (Equations (6) and (7)) [52]:\nFe+2 + 2Cl\u2212 \u2192 FeCl2 (6)\nFeCl2 + 2H2O\u2192 Fe(OH)2 + 2HCl (7)\nThis work aims to obtain and characterize two FeMnSi\u2013Ag SMAs as biodegradable alloys. Isothermal dynamic strain sweeps will be performed and their influence on the corrosion resistance will be investigated. Macro and nano investigations will be performed on corrosion compounds formed after immersion in Ringer\u2019s solution."

            "text": "Two experimental Fe29Mn5Si1Ag and Fe29Mn5Si2Ag (wt %) SMAs were obtained from high-purity materials (99.98% electrolytic Fe, 99.7% electrolytic metallic Mn, 99.5% metallic Si, 999.6 \u2030 fine Ag, by melting and remelting the first ingots in magnetic levitation induction furnace with cold crucible Fives Celes (Lautenbach, France) at R&D Consultancy & Services, Bucharest under Ar atmosphere. These specimens will be further designated as FeMnSi\u20131Ag and FeMnSi\u20132Ag. The ingots resulting from the re-melting were processed by cutting and turning, and finally they had a diameter of 18.5 mm and a height of 35\u201340 mm. Cylindrical samples of 3\u20134 mm thickness and parallelepiped samples of approximately 25\u00d7 15\u00d7 3 mm were prepared. The parallelepiped specimens were subjected to hot rolling at 1050 \u25e6C during three passes until a thickness of 1 mm was obtained. X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were made for phase analysis with an Expert PROMPD system (Panalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands type, Cu-X-ray tube (K\u03b1-1.54\u25e6)). The prepared samples measuring 25 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1 mm, were grinded on metallographic paper up to 5000 grit and cleaned with technical alcohol in an ultrasonic bath (PRO 50 ASonic, ULTRASONIC CLEANER, Shenzhen, China) for 60 min. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on two sample fragments (weighing approximately 40 mg) from each state (hot-rolled and cast) after the cutting procedure and were subsequently cleaned from oxides in an ultrasonic bath with technical alcohol for 60 min. The samples were weighed with a digital laboratory balance (PARTNER AS 220/C/2, RADWAG Balances & Scales, Radom, Poland). NETZSCH DSC equipment model DSC 200 F3 Maya (Netzsch, Selb, Germany, with sensitivity less than l W, temperature variation of 0.1 K and enthalpy accuracy generally <1%) was used for the experiments. Calibration of the equipment was performed with reference materials of Hg, Bi, In, Sn and Zn. Experimental setup of the DSC: one cooling cycle from room temperature (RT) ~25 \u25e6C to \u221250 \u25e6C and one heating cycle from \u221250 \u25e6C to 200 \u25e6C and again cooling to RT. The cooling and heating rate of the experiment was 10 K/min and was performed under protective atmosphere of Ar. For the analysis of the thermal behavior of the sample during cooling and heating, the Proteus software provided by NETZSCH was used using the tangent method. For the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), samples cut with an electro-discharge machine (EDM) were used, with the following dimensions: 25 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1 mm that were prepared by grinding on metallographic paper up to 5000 grit and cleaned in technical\nJ.

For each individual alloy, samples were tested by strain sweeps performed with a three-point-bending specimen holder (DMA-SS-3PB) using an Artemis NETZSCH (Netzsch, Selb, Germany) model DMA 242 analyzer. The equipment has a force resolution of 5\u00d7 10\u22123 N, amplitude range: \u00b10.1 to 240 \u00b5m and amplitude resolution: 5 \u00d7 10\u22123. DMA-SS-3PB performed on the FeMnSi\u20131Ag sample comprised 5 deformation cycles at a temperature of 40 \u25e6C, with a frequency of 1 Hz. Dynamic strain sweep tests are commonly used in materials science and engineering to characterize the viscoelastic properties of a material. The general purpose of dynamic strain sweep tests is to study the behavior of a material under cyclic loading at different strain amplitudes over a range of frequencies. Deformation was carried out in the range 1\u201320 \u00b5m, dividing this range into 5 equal segments, thus increasing the deformation within a cycle from 1 \u00b5m to 5 \u00b5m, to 10 \u00b5m, to 15 \u00b5m and reaching 20 \u00b5m, after which the force was removed and a cycle was completed. A similar cycle was performed for the three FeMnSi\u20132Ag samples. The difference consists in the deformation frequency, which was 1 Hz for the first sample (FeMnSi\u20132Ag(I)), 5 Hz for the second (FeMnSi\u20132Ag(II)) and 20 Hz for the third (FeMnSi\u20132Ag(III)). Immersion in Ringer\u2019s biological solution (chemical composition [g/L]: NaCl\u20146.5; KCl\u20140.42; CaCl2\u20140.25; NaHCO3\u20140.20) at 37 \u25e6C was carried out with the pH of the solution recorded during the first 72 h. The corrosion rate based on mass loss was determined for the FeMnSi\u2013Ag sample before and after applying the strain sweep. The samples before and after DMA-SS were subjected to an immersion corrosion resistance test. The in vitro tests involved immersion of hot-rolled FeMnSi\u20131Ag and FeMnSi\u20132Ag plates previously subjected to the DMA test and samples of the same alloys not subjected to the DMA test in biological Ringer\u2019s solution for 14 days at 37 \u25e6C in a thermostatically controlled enclosure. Samples placed in Ringer\u2019s solution (20 mL/cm2 ratio) were prepared by grinding on metallographic paper up to 5000 grit, cleaned in technical alcohol and weighed with an AS220 Partner analytical balance. After immersion, the samples were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in technical alcohol for 60 min each. Weighing resulted in initial masses after immersion and after ultrasonic cleaning, which were used to calculate corrosion rates according to ASTM G31-03 using the formula (w: weight loss in [g], A: exposed area in [cm2], t: time in [h] and \u03c1: density in [g/cm3]) [53]:\nCR = 8.76\u00d7 104 W\nAt\u03c1 , (8)\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a Bomem MB154S FT-IR spectrometer (Bomem, ABB group, Quebec city, Quebec, Canada) at an instrumental resolution of 4 cm\u22121. The samples were analyzed as powders which were obtained by scraping from the filter material. Each of the sample powders obtained was mixed in a mortar with KBr, and the mixture was pressed at a pressure of 100 atm to form pellets. We utilized a commercial scattering near-field microscope (neaSCOPE, attocube.com, accessed on 20 May 2023), equipped with a tuneable laser (MIRCAT, Daylight Solutions) to acquire monochromatic nano-IR images. The IR radiation, attenuated to a few mW power, was focused on a metallized tip (NCPt arrow, nanoandmore.com, accessed on 20 May 2023) using a parabolic mirror. The near-field optical interaction between the tip and sample was modulated by operating the atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode. AFM was used to assess the surface morphology evolution of the samples before and after strain sweep process. Nanosurf EasyScan II (Liestal, Switzerland) was used to scan the surfaces (50 \u00d7 50 and 3 \u00d7 3 \u00b5m2) using a Si tip (PPP CTR10) in the contact mode. The structure of the alloys and their condition before and after immersion in Ringer\u2019s solution was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). VegaTescan LMH II (TESCAN, Brno-Kohoutovice, Czech Republic) equipment with cathode supply voltage of 30 kV, secondary electron detector and working distance of 15.5 mm was used. The chemical composition analysis of the alloys, their surfaces after immersion and the distribution of elements on the surface was performed with an X-ray energy detector (energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Bruker, X-Flash 6-10, Billerica, MA, USA).\nJ.

The appearance of the microstructure changed after heat treatment at 1173 K (900 \u25e6C) for 30 min and water cooling. This revealed austenite grains with martensite plates inside that were several hundred micrometers in diameter (Figure 1a,b). No undissolved Si-rich precipitates can be observed after hot rolling treatment in the microstructure as in other FeMnSi SMA. Compared to FeMn alloy, the addition of Si resulted in a better recrystallization treatment, resulting in a more homogenized microstructure with an average grain size of 40 \u00b5m \u00b1 5 \u00b5m (mean value and standard deviation) [54]. Similar to other results in the literature, silver separation was observed based on the very low solubility of silver in the solid solution of iron\u2013manganese [55,56]. Besides silver dispersion, which could be beneficial for the degradation rate or antibacterial properties, in a few cases a high Ag agglomeration was

SEM micrographs of the experimental alloys: (a) FeMnSi\u20131Ag; (b) FeMnSi\u20132Ag.\nFeMnSi\u20131Ag and FeMnSi\u20132Ag have a complex microstructure consisting of \u03b3-austenite (fcc structure) and \u03b5-martensite (hcp structure) at room temperature. Small plate-like \u03b5martensite zones can be observed on the FeMnSi\u20132Ag alloy structure (Figure 1b) [54].\nThe chemical composition of the alloys is shown in Table 1 for areas larger than 1 mm2\nin the first two rows and at three different selected points on the 90 nm diameter surface marked in Figure 1b. The average Ag content is close to 1 and 2 wt % in the alloys, and the large differences shown between the areas of the three selected points highlight the very low solubility of Ag in Fe, Mn or FeMn solid solution and the fact that they separately form compounds with a high percentage of Ag, such as points 2 and 3. In these areas the FeMn\u2013Ag phase or pure Ag contaminated with FeMnSi solid solution is present at the surface. The XRD plots of the alloys (Figure 2) confirm the observations in the SEM images (Figure 1) and indicate the presence of two phases: \u03b3-austenite as the main one and \u03b5martensite. Note that it has been experimentally observed that a Mn content between 13 and 22 wt % in binary Fe\u2013Mn alloys favors the presence of the \u03b5-martensite phase, while a Mn content higher than 22 wt % favors the presence of the \u03b3-austenite phase [57]. However, in the case of Fe\u2013Mn\u2013Si alloys, this observation is not as pronounced as expected due to the presence of 4\u20135 wt % Si in the alloy. These observations show that martensitic transformation \u03b3\u2192 \u03b5 is much more enhanced in Fe26Mn5Si and Fe23Mn5Si alloys compared to Fe30Mn5Si. For alloys with higher Mn content, the elastic effect of the austenite matrix, when subjected to external stresses, has been highlighted. The effect of Si addition in FeMn alloys has been reported by Gavriljuk et al. [58] showing a lower stacking fault\nJ. Funct.

XRD patterns of FeMnSi\u20131Ag and FeMnSi\u20132Ag samples: (a) cast and (b) hot rolled.\nThe microstructural information can be correlated with the DSC curves in Figure 3, which illustrate reverse martensitic transformations during the heating process. According to the XRD results, the presence of both martensitic phases was indicated on the diffractograms and their reversion to \u03b3-fcc austenite can be identified by the DSC results. The \u03b5-martensite peaks are higher for the hot-rolled samples (Figure 2b) based on the presence of stress-induced martensite in the alloy after t e deformation process. Also observed in the XRD results, the peaks at 58 and 80 (2\u03b8) are also attributed to the \u03b5-phase [58]. The other peaks are attributed to body centered cubic (BCC) \u03b1\u2019-martensite together with retained FCC \u03b3-austenite. The main martensitic transformation in Fe-based SMAs is based on deformation (stress-induced) and less on the thermal effect on cooling (thermally induced). XRD experiments at different sample temperatures were performed in order to establish the main structural components (\u221250, 0, 25 and 100 \u25e6C), Figure S1. All samples analyzed are mainly austenitic phase type. The crystal structure of \u03b3-austenite is face-centered-cubic (FCC), Copper model cF4 [59]. The cell parameter has a bigger value of the pure \u03b3-Fe (0.36 nm), as preconized paying respect to the fact that this phase solid solution of Mn, Si and less Ag in Fe. Other common phases found in this system are \u03b4-ferrite in the sample at 25 \u25e6C and stress-induced \u03b5-martensite observed in all cases except the sample chilled down to \u221250 \u25e6C [58]. The \u03b1\u2019 phase like type crystallizes in a body-centered cubic structure, W-type\u2014Im3m. On the other hand, \u03b5-martensite exhibits hexagonal symmetry HCP, Mg-type\u2014P63.\nJ. Funct.

            "text": "Typically, for FeMn-based SMAs the martensitic phase transformation occurs over an extended temperature range and the exothermic peak, associated with martensite formation during cooling, is much less prominent compared to NiTi or CuZnAl materials. The corresponding A50 temperature (start of direct martensitic transformation, on cooling) is significantly reduced to 25 \u25e6C or below 0 after 1 or 2 heating\u2013cooling cycles. The transformation continues during the cooling step beyond the measurement limit of 223 K (\u221250 \u25e6C). This behavior could be related to crystal lattice distortion due to the higher manganese content in the alloy [57]. Compared to the Drevet et al.\u2019s [60] findings, the As point is lowered by the addition of Ag from 50 \u25e6C in the temperature range of 0\u201325 \u25e6C, which may favor the use of these materials in the medical field. Since the direct martensitic transformations (\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b5) were less intense, th corresponding XRD pattern in Figure 2 shows a bet er preserved large amount of \u03b3-auste ite phase. However, even though the martensitic transformation temperature decreased the FeMnSi\u20132Ag alloy, the kinetics of the transformation reaction was delayed by the increased mang nese content in th alloy. It is likely th t these alloys with shape memory capabilities could be used as implant materials inside the human body."

In this case, the material already performs several hundred thousand cycles or several million cycles depending on the application and the material will start to degrade at a certain stress state.

For the low frequency, 1 Hz, the damping behavior of the material, tan\u03b4, decreases with the repetition cycle, the fifth cycle, based on the increase of the storage modulus up to 0.01% strain when a plateau occurs by the end of the experiment. A higher damping capacity of an implant material may be useful for the integrity of the material in the first implantation period. For higher frequencies of 5 and 20 Hz, respectively, the internal friction of the material (damping capacity) increases with the stress cycle and frequency from 0.013 at 1 Hz (FeMnSi\u20131Ag) to 0.022 at 20 Hz (FeMnSi\u20132Ag) (Figure 4c,d). The first stress cycle of metallic material usually shows different and variable results depending on the misalignments, microcracks or voids in the material structure. The storage modulus at 1 Hz of the material increases with the degree of deformation at 0.01% deformation from 222,000 to 232,000 MPa and maintain its highest v lue until the end f the test. At the freque cy of 5 Hz, the storage mo ulus ini ially inc e ses with deformation, after which, starting at 0.0075% strain amplitude, relaxation occurs and the modulus values decrease to the initial values (Figure 4c). At 20 Hz, the storage modulus shows a continuous and gradual increase with increasing deformation and in this case no plateau can be observed.

The AFM images show a refinement of the martensite plates with increasing DMA-SS-3PB frequency, the values shown in Table 2. Systematic measurements were performed to quantify the impact of the strain frequency values on the martensite plate dimensions. For this purpose, five characteristic groups of martensite plates and five parallel plates within each group were chosen.\nTable 2.

A protective coating of metal oxide (colored marks) is created on the surface as a result of reactions. The deposition of calcium phosphate on the metal oxide layer, which results from interactions with biological fluids, enables cells to cling to the surface and create tissues [63]. Two hot-rolled FeMnSi\u20132Ag samples, one without DMA-SS and the other with DMASS, were immersed in Ringer\u2019s electrolyte solution at 37 \u25e6C for three days, and the pH of the solution was continuously monitored by recording the values minute by minute. Variations in pH are shown in Figure 6. Increased values are observed in both cases, with a higher rate for the sample without DMA-SS. It can also be noticed from the curves obtained by recording the pH that there is a greater variation of the pH for the solution in which the sample without DMA-SS was immersed, which confirms the structural change and the increase in the number of martensite plates by reducing their size observed by AFM. After 28 days of immersion in r-SBF solution, Li et al. [64] observed a boost in pH up to 7.8 for an iron structure with 80% porosity manufactured through direct metal printing.\nJ.\u00a0Funct.\u00a0Biomater.\u00a02023,\u00a014,\u00a0x\u00a0 \u00a0 11\u00a0 of\u00a0 22\u00a0 \u00a0\nIn\u00a0all\u00a0vibration\u00a0cases\u00a0(1\u00a0Hz\u00a0and\u00a05\u00a0Hz),\u00a0the\u00a0profile\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0samples\u00a0shows\u00a0a\u00a0decrease\u00a0in\u00a0 plate\u00a0sizes\u00a0down\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0nanometer\u00a0range.\u00a0The\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0plate\u00a0size\u00a0influences\u00a0the\u00a0shape\u00a0 memory\u00a0properties\u00a0[61,62]\u00a0and\u00a0will\u00a0change\u00a0the\u00a0corrosion\u00a0behavior\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0material.\u00a0\n3.4.\u00a0Evaluation\u00a0of\u00a0In\u00a0Vitro\u00a0Corrosion\u00a0Behavior\u00a0and\u00a0pH\u00a0Monitoring\u00a0 The\u00a0metal\u00a0interacts\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0liquid\u00a0medium\u00a0to\u00a0release\u00a0positive\u00a0ions\u00a0(Mn+)\u00a0while\u00a0keep\u2010 ing\u00a0the\u00a0electrons\u00a0 (e\u2212)\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0metallic\u00a0b se.\u00a0A\u00a0protective\u00a0coating\u00a0of\u00a0metal\u00a0oxide\u00a0(colored\u00a0 arks)\u00a0is\u00a0created\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0s rface\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0 lt\u00a0 f\u00a0 ti s.\u00a0The\u00a0deposition\u00a0of\u00a0calcium\u00a0phos\u2010 pha e\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0metal\u00a0oxide\u00a0layer,\u00a0w ich\u00a0results\u00a0from\u00a0interactions\u00a0with\u00a0 i l\u00a0fluids,\u00a0en\u2010 able \u00a0cells\u00a0to\u00a0cling\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0surf ce\u00a0and\u00a0cr ate\u00a0tissues\u00a0[63].\u00a0\nT o\u00a0 t\u2010rol ed\u00a0 Si\u20132Ag\u00a0 sa ples,\u00a0 e\u00a0 t\u00a0 \u2010 \u00a0 \u00a0 the\u00a0 other\u00a0with\u00a0 DMA\u2010SS,\u00a0were\u00a0immersed\u00a0i \u00a0Ringer\u2019s\u00a0electrolyte\u00a0solution\u00a0at\u00a037\u00a0\u00b0 \u00a0f \u00a0 \u00a0days,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0 pH\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0solution\u00a0was\u00a0continuously\u00a0monitored\u00a0by\u00a0re r i \u00a0t \u00a0 alues\u00a0minute\u00a0by\u00a0mi\u2010 nute.\u00a0Variations\u00a0in\u00a0pH\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a06.\u00a0Increased\u00a0values\u00a0are\u00a0observed\u00a0in\u00a0both\u00a0cases,\u00a0 with\u00a0a\u00a0higher\u00a0rate\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0sample\u00a0without\u00a0 \u2010SS.\u00a0It\u00a0can\u00a0also\u00a0be\u00a0noticed\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0curves\u00a0 obtained\u00a0by\u00a0recording\u00a0the\u00a0pH\u00a0that\u00a0there\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0greater\u00a0variation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0pH\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0solution\u00a0in\u00a0 which\u00a0the\u00a0sample\u00a0without\u00a0DMA\u2010SS\u00a0was\u00a0immersed,\u00a0which\u00a0confirms\u00a0the\u00a0structural\u00a0change\u00a0 and\u00a0the\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0martensite\u00a0plates\u00a0by\u00a0reducing\u00a0their\u00a0size\u00a0observed\u00a0by\u00a0AFM.\u00a0 After\u00a028\u00a0days\u00a0of\u00a0immersion\u00a0in\u00a0r\u2010SBF\u00a0solution,\u00a0Li\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0[64]\u00a0observed\u00a0a\u00a0boost\u00a0in\u00a0pH\u00a0up\u00a0to\u00a07.8\u00a0for\u00a0 an\u00a0iron\u00a0structure\u00a0with\u00a080%\u00a0porosity\u00a0manufactured\u00a0through\u00a0direct\u00a0metal\u00a0printing.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a06.\u00a0The\u00a0pH\u00a0variation\u00a0recorded\u00a0for\u00a072\u00a0h\u00a0of\u00a0immersion\u00a0in\u00a0Ringer\u2019s\u00a0solution\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0hot\u00a0rolled\u00a0\nFeMnSi\u20132Ag\u00a0samples,\u00a0without\u00a0and\u00a0with\u00a0DMA\u2010SS.\u00a0\nFollowing\u00a0equation\u00a0(8),\u00a0corrosion\u00a0rates\u00a0were\u00a0determined\u00a0for\u00a0each\u00a0mass\u00a0gain/loss\u00a0of\u00a0 hot\u2010rolled\u00a0FeMnSi\u20132Ag\u00a0samples\u00a0subjected\u00a0to\u00a0pH\u00a0monitoring\u00a0 for\u00a072\u00a0h\u00a0 (Table\u00a03).\u00a0Sample\u00a0 areas\u00a0were\u00a0determined:\u00a0FeMnSi\u20132Ag\u00a0=\u00a02.8\u00a0cm2\u00a0(sample\u00a0without\u00a0DMA\u2010SS)\u00a0and\u00a0FeMnSi\u2013 2Ag\u00a0=\u00a02.6\u00a0cm2\u00a0(sample\u00a0with\u00a0DMA\u2010SS).\u00a0The\u00a0corrosion\u00a0rate\u00a0results\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Table\u00a03.\u00a0A\u00a0 higher\u00a0corrosion\u00a0rate\u00a0was\u00a0obtained\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0stressed\u00a0sample\u00a0(DMA\u2010SS).\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nFollowing equation (8), corrosion rates were determined for each mass gain/loss of hotrolled FeMnSi\u20132Ag samples subjected to pH monitoring for 72 h (Table 3). Sample areas were determined: FeMnSi\u20132Ag = 2.8 cm2 (sample without DMA-SS) and FeMnSi\u20132Ag = 2.6 cm2 (sample with DMA-SS). The corrosion rate results are shown in Table 3. A higher corrosion rate was obtained for the stressed sample (DMA-SS).\nJ. Funct. Biomater. 2023, 14, 377 12 of 21\nTable 4 presents the degree of oxidation and the main elements identified on the immersed samples according to EDS analysis. Although the mass loss is higher for the stressed material (DMA-SS), the degree of oxidation is not higher, which means that the degradation of the material occurs faster.\nConsidering the standard reduction potentials of Fe of\u22120.44 V and Mn of\u22121.18 V [61], the Fe\u2013Mn alloy exhibits a more active corrosion potential due to the overall electron potential reduction of iron due to the addition of Mn [65\u201368]. Regarding the phases found in Fe\u2013Mn alloys microstructure, \u03b1-ferrite (BCC) shows a better corrosion rate than \u03b5-martensite (HCP) and \u03b3-ferrite (FCC) [69]. The galvanic corrosion occurrence as a result of the association of these phases and the volume in which they are found in the material [70] would increase the corrosion rate of the alloy [52,65]. XRD results on the oxidized surface after immersion highlight the presence of \u03b3 and \u03b5 phases on the surface alongside iron oxides, manganese oxide, iron hydroxides and carbonates [71], Figure S3. The mass loss (five samples were immersed and the average values are given in Table 5) recorded by immersion tests was applied to determine the material corrosion rate using Equation (8).

The surface of the materials is generally clean with no large cracks pores, oxide compounds or other structural defects that may cause corrosion acceleration. After the immersion period, the surfaces in Figure 8d\u2013l indicate generalized corrosion with intergranular corrosion for all samples from macro (1 mm) to micro (20 \u00b5m) scale. For all cases, one phase appears to be more corroded (Figure 8e,h,k) presumably the austenite phase which is less resistant. At this stage, the undissolved phase showed corrosion pits of 1\u20132 \u00b5m in diameter. The materials show different stages of corrosion from macro to micro scale. The mechanical integrity of the materials was not affected at the surface; no major cracks were observed at the edges of the samples or deep pits at the surface. All samples show non-metallic compounds interconnected with the metal surface. The sample surface stressed at 5 Hz is cleaner and homogeneously corroded. At the micro scale, non-metallic compounds smaller than 1 \u00b5m were observed (Figure 8f) and areas not completely corroded with martensitic plates were identified (Figure 8l), confirming the higher strength of the martensite phase compared to the austenite phase.\nJ.

During scraping, fibers were also removed from the filter material, which are observed on the FTIR spectra in Figure 9. The changes in the fibers\u2019 spectra are attributed to the metals in the powder composition. A shift of the vibrational peak of the alcoholic hydroxyl groups (\u2212OH) can be observed from 3437 cm\u22121 [74] in the fiber sample to about 3300 cm\u22121 in the spectra of all other samples (FeMnSi\u2013Ag, FeMnSi). The shift can be assigned to the H-bonds and van der Waals interactions between the fiber molecules and the metallic composition of each sample. The spectra also showed the spherical structure of the magnetic particles in the powders of all the six samples by the shape of the baseline, which drops at the left side due to the Mie scattering effect [75,76]. The scattering effect is more pronounced in metallic samples and almost undetected in sample fiber. High water adsorption of filter fiber is still evident on the corrosion products spectra by the noisy aspect they exhibit in the ranges of 4000\u20133700 cm\u22121 and 1695\u20131527 cm\u22121, respectively. The affinity toward water decreases in fiber samples where the broad peaks from 3300 cm\u22121 are maintained, indicating the existence of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds at the fiber level. In the other samples, the OH peaks narrow and move toward 3427, signifying that the H bonds are less.\nJ.\u00a0Funct.\u00a0Biomater.\u00a02023,\u00a014,\u00a0x\u00a0 \u00a0 15\u00a0 of\u00a0 22\u00a0

The skeletal vibrations of the fiber denoted by the peaks at 1023 cm\u22121 exhibit changes in shape and left shift in samples, indicating interactions between the filter fibers and the particles of metals. The very sharp peak at 1023 cm\u22121 in the FeMnSi\u2013Ag spectrum can be assigned to residual NaHCO3 [76] from the Ringer\u2019s solution. In addition to the fiber signal, part of the bands are proper new bands at \u03bd = 1428, 1162, 876, 697, and 566 cm\u22121 observed in the FTIR spectra of FeMnSi and FeMnSi\u2013Ag compounds. The peaks from 1428 and 1162 cm\u22121 may correspond to the Fe\u2013OH and Mn\u2013 OH compounds (Equation (4) and Table 4) [78,79]. The peak band observed at 876 cm\u22121 may be related to the Fe\u2013OH vibrations of \u03b1-FeOOH. Moreover, the absorption bands at 697 and 566 cm\u22121 could be related to \u03b1-Fe2O3 [76]. Meanwhile, the small peaks observed at 520 and 720 cm\u22121 can be ascribed to the Mn\u2013O vibrations. No different visible bands were identified between FeMnSi and FeMnSi\u2013Ag degradation compounds, probably because of the small amounts of Ag from the sample and high resistance to corrosion of the compounds formed with Ag.\nJ. Funct. Biomater. 2023, 14, 377 16 of 21\nIn Figures 10\u201312, a new nanoscale analysis technique was used to show the oxide compounds identified on FeMnSi\u2013Ag alloys after atmospheric exposure and immersion in Ringer\u2019s solution for 24 h. No surface cleaning process was performed to observe the compounds on the surface and to characterize the beginning of the degradation process of this nanoscale and early material. During the sample scanning process, we employed a Michelson interferometer in a pseudoheterodyne detection scheme to detect and analyze the tip-scattered light and eliminate far-field background scattering [80]. This allowed us to simultaneously record AFM topography, mechanical phase, IR absorption and reflectivity properties. The spatial resolution primarily depended on the probing tip radius (approximately 20 nm), while the optical contrasts were influenced by the local optical properties of the material beneath the tip and the IR illumination wavelength. In nano-FTIR spectroscopy mode, the neaSCOPE system utilized coherent broadband mid-infrared illumination from a DFG laser source (Toptica). The back-scattered light was detected using an asymmetric Michelson interferometer [81].\nJ.\u00a0Funct.\u00a0Biomater.\u00a02023,\u00a014,\u00a0x\u00a0 \u00a0 16\u00a0 of\u00a0 22\u00a0

Corrosion sites are revealed using different types of illumination of the surface profile (AFM scanning by tapping with laser light focused on a sharp AFM tip, all-optical interferometric detection recovers both the amplitude and the phase of the light scattered by the tip, providing complete information about the complex optical properties of the sample, (e.g., absorption and reflectivity)). The corroded sample had mainly two types of zones. One with a relatively thin layer and the other with a relatively thick layer, as shown in the images in Figures 10 and 11. Several compounds and areas on the surface, all at nanoscale, were selected for FTIR investigations to identify the compound types. Apart from the thick layer spectra, a broad and strong band can be observed at about 1100 cm\u22121 (marked with a blue circle) similar to that of FeMnSi sample and therefore not related to Ag addition. For 1100 cm\u22121 there are three possibilities: one can be attributed to the presence of SiO2, the second to a carbonate compound or to the presence of a C\u2013O bond. At the thin layer level, a particle with a strong and broad band (similar to phonon absorption of oxides) at about 800 cm\u22121 (orange spectrum) can be observed, this fact indicates the presence of a common inorganic ion such as CO32\u2212, which is confirmed by EDS analysis (the results shown in Table 4). At the same time, Veneranda et al., show in their work the goethite compound (\u03b1-FeOOH) at 798 cm\u22121, which is more likely to cover the entire surface of the material [82]. In the thick layer, two particles are observed with a clear peak at about 1590 cm\u22121. Note that the near-field amplitude of these particles is very small and therefore the spectra are quite noisy. Su et al., identified at the 1590 cm\u22121 peak the presence of COO- which can be attributed to the carboxyl group stretching [83]. The near-field phase image at 1085\u20131121 cm\u22121 shows more contrast again, similar to the FeMnSi sample, indicating that the broad band at about 1100 cm\u22121 is heterogeneously distributed on the surface. Interestingly, this image also shows particles (marked with red circles) that absorb with comparable strength. The near-field phase image at 910 cm\u22121 reveals the particle that produced the broad phonon-like absorption centered at 800 cm\u22121. The peak at approximately 910 cm\u22121 which is clearly seen in this spectrum can be attributed to the origin of the signal from Si\u2013O\u2013H stretching [84,85].\nJ. Funct.

The influence of an external stress, achieved by using a dynamic mechanical amplitude sweep, on the microstructure, and corrosion-resistance behavior was determined. The main corrosion products were identified and a degradation rate was established. The experimental results led to the following conclusions:\n- the levitation furnace is a proper solution for manufacturing FeMnSi\u2013Ag alloys with different amounts of Ag added (1, 2 wt %). - the materials exhibit excellent structural and chemical homogeneity, with Ag spreading within the structure (\u03b3-austenite and \u03b5-martensite phases were identified by XRD). - the DSC results validate the possibility of medical use of a functional FeMnSi-based material with an A50 temperature between 0 and 50 \u25e6C. - Preceding the start of the in vitro degradation process, DMA_SS was used to vibrate the material for daily use as implant material. - AFM studies have shown that the alloy has undergone a structural change due to stress-sweeping effects, which has also led to an increase in the amount of \u03b5-martensite plates, a phase less resistant to corrosion than the \u03b3-austenite phase. - nano-FTIR spectroscopy and imaging can currently provide spectral statistics of externally corroded metal with a spatial resolution of 20 nm. - Nano-scale compounds were identified on the metallic surface after material immersion, confirming that the corrosion process evolves from nano to macro scale.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/jfb14070377/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.-M.R., G.Z. and N.C.; methodology, L.-G.B., M.M.C. and R.C.; software B.P. and R.C.; validation, N.C., L.-G.B., N.-M.L. and A.M.M.; formal analysis, C.P., A.M.M.; investigation, A.-M.R., N.C. and B.P.; resources, N.C.; data curation, R.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.-M.R. and N.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.-G.B.; visualization, G.Z. and C.P.; supervision, N.C.; project administration, N.C.
