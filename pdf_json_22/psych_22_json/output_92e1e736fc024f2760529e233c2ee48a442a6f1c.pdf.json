    "abstractText": "This study examined Flow with Nature (FWN) treatment, which is an integrative intervention (rehabilitation) based on eco and environmental psychology, psychotherapeutic theories and professional psychological practice. FWN is intended for depression rehabilitation with the help of social support, nature environments and FWN exercises. Exercises encourage sensing the environment, mindful awareness, psychological processing and focusing on the future. The FWN treatment proceeds in separate stages (horizon, growth and path), which emphasise nature, group (social support) and FWN exercises differently. This study focused on the experiences of the participants in the FWN treatment. Finnish adults who had been diagnosed with clinical depression took part in the FWN treatment (N = 82) and answered feedback questions (by paper, electronic questionnaire or phone discussion). Answers were analysed using theory-based content analysis. Data were collected between spring 2019 and spring 2020. The majority of the participants were women (82%) and on average 44 years old. Content analysis revealed that the participant feedback answers were in agreement with the central theoretical themes of FWN. The participants emphasised the significance of nature, social support and exercises differently. Moreover, the significance of these ingredients differed according to the stages of treatment: in the horizon stage restorative (e.g., fascination) and comprehensive nature experiences (e.g., connectedness with nature), in the growth stage social support (e.g., peer support) and in the path stage environmental self-regulation (e.g., nature as a part of life) were emphasised. These results are in accordance with the objectives of the stages and seem to support the phase-based rationale. The participants\u2019 experiences of the key elements of the intervention, social support and nature environment were experienced mainly positively, which supports their inclusion in future intervention versions. In the future, FWN exercises should be developed to better enable participants\u2019 possibilities for concentration and being present in the moment (mindfulness). Exercises should also be simplified to match the target group\u2019s cognitive abilities.",

            "text": "There is a need to develop new and effective treatments for stress-related mental disorders (e.g., depression) that reduce individual suffering as well as its high costs to society. Nature experiences have been linked to improved self-esteem among people suffering from mental illness (Barton et\u00a0 al., 2012), and nature-based interventions (NBIs) have shown positive effects in the treatment of and rehabilitation from stress-related illnesses, such as depression (Kim et\u00a0al., 2009; Annerstedt and W\u00e4hrborg, 2011; Sahlin et\u00a0 al., 2012, 2015; W\u00e4hrborg et\u00a0 al., 2014). For example, nature settings seem to strengthen the benefits of cognitive behavioural therapy for major depressive disorder (Kim et\u00a0 al., 2009). Using nature walks as a part of the \u2018Coping with Depression\u2019 program resulted in a significant decrease in depression and an increase in positive mental well-being over an 8-week intervention and a 3-month follow-up (Korpela et\u00a0 al., 2016). In a series of single-group studies of a 12-week therapeutic horticulture programme with clinically depressed adults, a significant change for the better was found in several mental health variables, such as depression and anxiety, during the intervention (Gonzalez et\u00a0 al., 2011).\nA meta-analysis of relatively long-term NBIs (5 weeks, on average) including adults with or without mental and/or physical health problems revealed that NBIs were effective for improving positive affect and reducing anxiety, depressive mood and negative affect (Coventry et\u00a0 al., 2021). The most effective interventions lasted between 8 and 12 weeks, and the optimal duration ranged from 20 to 90 min. Another review of shortterm NBIs (from 1 min to 2 days in duration) for adults indicated that they improve positive mood, decrease negative mood, stress and anxiety and increase physical activity (Wilkie and Davinson, 2021). In these studies, \u2018nature-based\u2019 refers to time spent in both unmanaged nature and publicly accessible, managed parks and gardens. However, the majority of such NBI studies lacked proper descriptions of the settings and intervention techniques as well as theoretical frameworks guiding NBI designs (Wilkie and Davinson, 2021). In our study, we\u00a0 have given consideration to these aspects of the study design.\nWe focused on nature-based rehabilitation for depression, which is a psychiatric syndrome with several symptoms: low mood, loss of interest or pleasure, fatigue, decrease in selfconfidence, feelings of worthlessness, excessive feelings of guilt and self-blame, thoughts about suicide or self-harm, self-harming behaviour, decreased concentration, either slowed or agitated movement, sleep disturbances and changes in appetite or weight (ICD-10 diagnostic system; Finnish Current Care Guidelines, 2016).\nFlow with Nature treatment (FWN) is a theory-, researchand practice-based rehabilitation intervention for clinical depression. The aim is to reduce depression symptoms and to support well-being and psychological processing. FWN was developed based on a previous 5-week NBI (FWN group; Salonen et\u00a0al., 2018, 2020; Salonen and T\u00f6rnroos, 2019; Salonen, 2020) for promoting occupational well-being. The results of that 5-week intervention showed, first, that attending the group promoted visiting and experiencing nature in all seasons. Second, comprehensive nature experience (e.g., connectedness with\nnature; Salonen et\u00a0al., 2016) and awareness of perceived impacts of nature were strengthened and participants could process problematic psychological issues with the help of nature elements. Third, negative nature experiences were reduced."

            "text": "The FWN treatment is an integrative intervention (rehabilitation) based on theories of restorative environments (Attention Restoration Theory: Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989; Kaplan, 1995; and stress reduction theory: Ulrich, 1983) and so-called comprehensive views on human\u2013nature relation, such as environmental self-regulation (favourite place studies: Korpela and Yl\u00e9n, 2009), nature connectedness (e.g., CNS: Mayer et\u00a0al., 2009), deep reflections in nature (Winter and Koger, 2004; Brymer et\u00a0 al., 2010) and comprehensive nature experience (Salonen et\u00a0 al., 2016; Salonen, 2020). Furthermore, this intervention includes elements from Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (e.g., Hayes et\u00a0 al., 2012) and the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change (Prochaska et\u00a0 al., 2013). The intervention is strongly rooted in the first author\u2019s years of professional psychological practice involving nature-based methods in therapeutic work with clients suffering from mental disorders. The developers of the FWN methods are researchers but also professional psychologists and psychotherapists.\nThe FWN treatment is based on the support of both social interaction (social support) and natural environments (environmental self-regulation). The following general principles are characteristic to FWN: regular social support (e.g., weekly meetings), psychological and physical safety (e.g., support from the facilitator and group, safe environment), respect for other group members as well as nature (i.e., everyone\u2019s experiences and favourite places are respected), flexibility (e.g., the FWN exercises are optional and the participants\u2019 acute needs are primary) and responsibility (i.e., for rehabilitation and towards the environment).\nIn addition to social support, FWN participants are encouraged to recognise nature environments\u2019 significance for one\u2019s own well-being, and they receive support for psychological and environmental self-regulation. Environmental self-regulation refers to the use of physical settings and their experiential contents as a means of self-, affect- and stress-regulation (Korpela et\u00a0 al., 2018). Nature is not only a physical stage in which the rehabilitation takes place, but an essential part of the rehabilitation. For example, the participants are instructed to experience nature with many senses and be\u00a0mindfully aware of their surroundings. In addition, supporting nature connectedness is an integral part of the treatment because when individuals experience sameness and continuity with nature they can more easily identify nature elements that reflect and symbolise their experiences and, in turn, help in processing those experiences. In addition, experiences are shared with one another by visiting others\u2019 favourite places and with the help of nature elements.\nThe FWN treatment has separate stages (Horizon, Growth and Path) that emphasise nature, group (social support) and FWN exercises differently (Table\u00a0 1). At each stage, there are four different FWN exercises with similar structures: first, experiencing nature individually and then sharing the nature\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 768372\nplace experiences in pairs or with the group. However, FWN exercises differ from each other according to the contents and emphasis of the stages.\nIn the first stage, Horizon, the focus is on shifting attention to here and now with the help of a natural environment (\u2018The mind opens to the horizon\u2019). This mindfulness makes it possible to be\u00a0 present in the moment and in the group in a safe and\npermissive way. The Horizon stage is largely based on the triphasic favourite place exercise (Salonen, 2012), where mindfulness in nature and nature connectedness are supported in three different phases (individual, couple, group) with the help of favourite place exercises and by sharing the nature place experiences. The Horizon exercises focus especially on grouping (e.g., visiting each other\u2019s favourite places), recognising favourite places and supporting nature connectedness (e.g., What do I\u00a0need? exercise). At the Horizon stage, the participants can, for example, recognise favourite places in which nature impacts them most positively and significantly.\nIn the second stage, Growth, the focus is on supporting mental growth and positive psychological processing, such as psychological flexibility, positive change in self-perception and personal emancipation. The growth exercises focus on processing the history of one\u2019s life (Life cycle exercise), negative experiences (Problem place exercise), psychological flexibility (Visit emotive places exercise) and positive self-image (Nature feedback exercise). At the Growth stage, the participants become more aware of natural elements that reflect one\u2019s own feelings or unfinished experiences (symbols), and they acquire tools for psychological processing with the help of nature symbols and social support (e.g., peer support).\nThe final stage, Path, focuses on the future time frame (\u2018The path takes you\u00a0forward\u2019): experimenting with alternatives and affirming positive change (Prochaska et\u00a0al., 2013) in everyday life after FWN. The Path exercises include allowing dreams about a desirable future (Nature dream map exercise), experimenting with change alternatives (Towards change and Nature anchor exercise) and supporting positive self-perception (Nature present exercise) as well as environmental self-regulation (Korpela and Yl\u00e9n, 2009). At the Path stage, the participants are supported in engaging themselves in future outdoor recreation and in using FWN exercises both during meetings and after rehabilitation (\u2018FWN independent\u2019). \u2018FWN independent\u2019 exercises are developed for participants\u2019 independent use (without the group) and are shared by e-mail.\nThe present study focuses on the experiences and feedback of the FWN treatment participants here also refers to RCT research. Our first aim was to present the central theoretical views, objectives and methods of the FWN treatment, and, secondly, to qualitatively describe the occurrence of the central theoretical themes in the FWN treatment participants\u2019 feedback."

The present research focuses on the data (N = 82) collected from participants who took part in the group treatment and answered feedback questions after the intervention period (by paper, electronic questionnaire or phone discussion). The majority of the participants were women (82%), and they were on average 44 years old.\nFlow with nature treatment meetings took place in five cities across Finland and there were altogether 16 such groups. Every group had 12 meetings held in nearby nature like parks, urban and rural forests and by water. Each meeting lasted one-and-a-half hours. The FWN group included 3 to 10 participants (around 6 on average). The groups were supervised by health care and social services professionals (psychologists and an occupational health nurse) who had received training for the FWN treatment. During restrictions caused by the Covid pandemic in the spring of 2020, the FWN treatment was conducted via online meetings so that each participant was in their own favourite place in nearby nature, and the experiences were shared via video call (for example, using a smartphone).\nThe feedback form included questions on experiences during the FWN treatment: What felt important? (i.e., in the group, nature and exercises); What felt difficult? (i.e., in the group, nature and exercises); Was there something unnecessary? (i.e., in the group, nature and exercises); What are your memories of your nature experience?; and Any other comments? Answers were analysed using theory-based content analysis (Tuomi and Saraj\u00e4rvi, 2002) and a model or a categorisation frame (FWN model) that was developed for this study (see Table\u00a0 2). In the analysis of the data, the written descriptions were read through and theoretical coding (without the computer programme) was used for the categorising. Similar expressions were grouped together to form a category. In the theory-based content analysis, main categories and subcategories were examined in relation to the FWN model. In other words, the participants\u2019 experiences (both positive and negative) were categorised in relation to the FWN treatment and the separate stages (Horizon, Growth, Path). The FWN model was used as a framework when identifying the themes.\nTo assess the reliability of the coding, an independent second coder analysed 50% of the data on the basis of the FWN model in the same way as the first coder. The evaluation compatibility was 84%."

The participants appreciated peer support, small group size, confidential atmosphere, open discussion, accepting differences and having an empathic group facilitator. Empathy among the group and gratitude for the empathic group facilitator were described as follows:\n23: It was as if I\u00a0had a new family.\n15: You [facilitator] are so hearty and genuine and can empathise so well with others\u2019 feelings!

This is an example of the flexibility of an FWN exercise:\n10: There was no exact template for the exercises, but I\u00a0was able to carry them out. It felt natural to me in that moment."

For example, in the following quote the participants felt accepted by nature and experienced a sense of nature connectedness:\n74: [It felt good] to hug trees and to lean on them, and to sense the acceptance of nature toward me.\n50: Not everybody has a deep nature connection, but it can be\u00a0learned in nature.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 768372\nThe significance of social support in the Horizon stage was seen mainly positively: grouping, sharing place experiences; but also reluctance to share one\u2019s place experiences.

The following example shows what a participant felt was important (positive):\n63: [I felt] strong confidence that I\u00a0could talk about my own issues in the group. The experience of peer support made me realise that I\u00a0was not alone with my problems [\u2026] and that others have difficulties solving such problems as well.\nThe exercises in the Growth stage focused on psychological processing (support for processing) as can be\u00a0 seen in the following comment during the \u2018Life cycle\u2019 exercise:\n27: The life paths that relate to childhood or the past can also be\u00a0 found in a forest: For example, that pile of brushwood looks like my teenage years, and that clear path along a few rootstocks that are easily crossed looks like my \u201cyoung adult\u2019s uncomplicated working life\u201d. Those small, beautiful spruces brought my father to my mind.\nThere were also difficulties in benefitting from the exercises because they were felt to be\u00a0 unsuitable by some participants. For example, finding metaphors (nature symbols) was difficult or the theme not interesting for some. In those cases, difficulties may have been there at the beginning, but the perception of nature may have eventually eased this processing, like the following quote shows:\n23: The most impressive experience was perhaps in the meeting in which the task was to remember the past and identify what kind of thoughts arise. The topic did not quite convince me, but when walking in the forest I\u00a0paid attention to the stubs that the moss had covered.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In summary, this study examined the FWN treatment, intended for the rehabilitation of depression with the help of social support, nature environments and FWN exercises. Exercises encourage multi-sensory sensing of the environment, mindful awareness, psychological processing and focusing on the future. These central theoretical themes of the FWN treatment were found in the feedback from the participants in the FWN treatment. It was also observed that the significance of nature, social support and exercises differed at the different stages.\nHow often the different themes were mentioned reveals that the FWN treatment was experienced mostly positively. FWN experiences, which included positive experiences of social support, peaceful natural environments and FWN in general (e.g., regularity, participation and perceived impact), were mentioned equally often in participants\u2019 feedback. These factors are the ones on which the FWN is based.\nAmong the positive experiences mentioned at the separate stages, nature and social support were emphasised differently. At the Horizon stage restorative (e.g., fascination) and comprehensive nature experiences (e.g., connectedness with nature) were mentioned most often, at the Growth stage social support (e.g., peer support) and at the Path stage environmental self-regulation (e.g., nature as a part of life). These results are in accordance with the objectives of these separate stages and seem to support the phase-based rationale. In the Horizon stage, the purpose is to make it possible to be\u00a0 present in the moment (mindfulness) in nature, so that restoration and comprehensive nature experiences are facilitated. In the Growth stage, the focus is on psychological processing (also of problematic issues), so the confidential social support is essential. In the Path stage, the idea is that positive nature experiences become part of environmental self-regulation and part of a person\u2019s life.\nNegative experiences mostly related to difficulties (participation, concentration, mindfulness, online meetings and FWN exercises). When considering the target group (depressed persons), the results are at quite understandable. For example, having difficulties leaving home, concentrating or being present in the moment (mindfulness), especially at the beginning of the FWN intervention (Horizon stage), may be\u00a0 typical features of depression (ICD-10 diagnostic system; Finnish Current Care Guidelines, 2016). An important part of FWN is that participants are asked to approach these challenges and practise such behaviours. In addition, difficulties with online meetings and FWN exercises should be\u00a0 taken into consideration in the development of future versions so that they do not cause an unnecessarily heavy psychological load.\nFrequency results revealed that the natural environment was mostly experienced positively. Disturbing factors in nature related mainly to seasons, weather conditions or disturbances caused by people (e.g., littering and traffic). A previous study suggests that with the help of a NBI, these kinds of negative experiences can be\u00a0 reduced (e.g., Salonen, 2020)."

            "text": "The results for the perceived impacts of FWN are similar to those of earlier studies on restoration (e.g., Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989) and health experiences (e.g., Salonen and T\u00f6rnroos, 2019). Feedback about growth experiences also suggests that FWN can support the rehabilitation process, which is in line with earlier studies (e.g., Salonen, 2020).\nIt was also shown that participants appreciate the general principles of FWN, including regularity, safety, flexibility and freedom. The results give rise to the idea that FWN could increase participants\u2019 own responsibility for rehabilitation and recovery because of the possibilities and tools of FWN for processing one\u2019s issues by oneself. This view is also supported by a study in which the participants in the FWN treatment group experienced their work or study ability to be\u00a0 better at the end of the intervention than did participants in the control group who received only TAU. However, not all participants may be\u00a0 ready for such a responsibility. Participants differed from each other regarding their psychological and physical ability to function. Leaving home was already a big step for some of the participants, whereas others started to utilise the FWN exercises independently from the start.\nParticipants also differed from each other in regard to their experience of safety. For example, in one group the facilitator spent a short time with one participant in the same area but could not be\u00a0 seen by others. That was felt as distressing by some participants. Consequently, flexibility and freedom may also cause uncertainty and stress. To some participants, exact limits and schedules mean safety. In future, there could be\u00a0 two facilitators per group so that the other facilitator can conduct individual supervision when necessary without causing uncertainty in the minds of other members of the group. New forms of FWN could also be\u00a0 developed for different groups according to their ability to function, experiences of safety or severity of depression symptoms, such as FWN for slight and moderate depression and separately for severe depression. In the latter, more attention could be\u00a0 paid to psychological safety (e.g., two facilitators in a group) and social support (e.g., support leaving home).\nAccording to the current results, participants might re-evaluate their view of depression during the FWN treatment. The reason for this may be\u00a0 that all of the FWN themes (e.g., background views and exercises) consider human experiences common to most people, including: obstacles to achieving restoration or a positive self-concept, difficulties in noticing one\u2019s own needs, unfinished psychic work of past experiences or lack of selfcompassion. FWN does not emphasise depression as a disorder even though the treatment is developed for depressed persons; all participants in our study had a depression diagnosis. The participants\u2019 own view of depression and its changes was not separately or specifically asked about, hence this topic would require further study."

            "text": "Flow with nature consists of three different stages (Horizon, Growth, Path) in which the orientation towards nature, human\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 768372\nrelations and exercises varies. Despite this, the results are discussed here as a whole so that a more comprehensive and holistic picture of the FWN treatment is obtained.\nThe FWN treatment is based on the support of the social group and nature elements. The results indicate that the participants complied well with the exercises and were able to use the guidance provided by their facilitator. At the beginning (Horizon stage), the formation of the group was relevant and made possible with the help of the facilitator (e.g., accepting atmosphere) and certain exercises (e.g., the triphasic favourite place exercise). After that (Growth stage), stronger confidence within the group became essential so that even difficult issues could be\u00a0 shared and processed. Processing was made possible through growth exercises (e.g., Life cycle exercise). The results also indicated that positive group experiences could continue (Path stage) in some ways after the rehabilitation. For example, the mental image of a favourite place introduced by another group member was felt to be\u00a0 impressive and helpful. Some of the members maintained contact with each other after the rehabilitation but this was not originally the purpose of FWN.\nThe natural environment is not only a physical stage on which FWN is performed but is also an essential part of the rehabilitation and psychological process. Our study shows that the significance of nature can also be\u00a0seen as a process in which nature connectedness develops through rehabilitation, as did human relations (social support). This objective was gradually achieved by strengthening connectedness with nature and nature mindfulness with the help of exercises (e.g., Horizon stage exercise What I\u00a0 need), peaceful nature environments, restoration and comprehensive nature experiences. After that (Growth stage), nature elements \u2018came alive\u2019, symbolising one\u2019s inner experiences (nature symbols). When one feels as being a part of nature, then in turn nature becomes a part of them as well; this way, nature elements can more easily symbolise one\u2019s own experiences. Because of the increase of nature connectedness during FWN, it is understandable that the desire for more nature experiences in the future increases as well. In the last stage of the FWN treatment (Path stage), the focus was on the future time frame and especially \u2018nature as a part of life\u2019 was essential. Thus, nature can become a part of environmental self-regulation (Korpela and Yl\u00e9n, 2009) in one\u2019s own life and also support well-being after rehabilitation.\nThe FWN group sessions were held in nearby nature, such as in parks. According to the results, factors like traffic, mechanical sounds of urban nature (not peaceful) were experienced as disturbing. This brings a challenge to community planning and politics if we\u00a0 are to retain restorative nature areas suitable for interventions near residential environments; being \u2018at peace and in quietude\u2019 in nature is essential for FWN.\nThe results also showed that some of the participants had difficulties with the FWN treatment, their group, the natural environment or the exercises. Difficulties with the FWN and group experiences concerned, for example: leaving home, obstacles to restoration and comprehensive nature experience, sharing one\u2019s personal issues, lack of confidence in the group and experiencing the facilitator negatively. These are matters that should be\u00a0 taken into consideration more thoroughly in the future, especially with depressed persons. One option could be\u00a0to\nlengthen the duration of the FWN period. That would provide more time and possibilities for building confidence between the participants and strengthen their connectedness with nature.\nFurther, the results showed that some of the exercises were experienced as difficult and complex, especially the \u2018towards change\u2019 exercise. It is important that the exercises do not cause extra cognitive load and that there is enough time to address negative emotions arising from the group experience. As such, this exercise should be\u00a0 modified by adjusting it to the needs of group members or removing it entirely.\nParticipants also proposed that exercises for independent use should be\u00a0 sent to them every week instead of sending them all at once before the final meeting. This is a recommended procedure because it may be\u00a0 easier to apply exercises independently but discuss them in group meetings."

            "text": "The data were collected during different seasons, so participants\u2019 experiences in darker seasons (autumn and winter) and different weather conditions were taken into consideration. Because FWN has a clear structure that can be\u00a0 repeated, it is moderately easy to bring it into use in the health care system and modify it for the general public as well as for use in education.\nThere were some shortcomings in the research. The participants, who volunteered, were mostly female. This may have affected the results in such a way that, for example, the group dynamics of the \u2018women\u2019s groups\u2019 differed from the mixed or male groups. Since only few men were in any one group at the same time, some of the men may have felt as \u2018not belonging\u2019 and possibly received less social support relevant to their situation.\nThe differences in how often the different stages (Path stage in particular) were mentioned in the feedback were moderately small. This may have been due to the fact that the questions for feedback referred to the treatment as a whole, which included the group, nature and the exercises. So, the participants did not necessarily recognise different stages during or after a treatment. For example, if it had been asked how FWN could be\u00a0 utilised after the rehabilitation, descriptions of the Path stage would probably have being mentioned more frequently.\nThe data were collected mainly via survey (pen-and-pencil and/or e-mail, but some participants were interviewed by telephone because they had not replied to feedback questions). It seemed that the phone discussions enabled more versatile and longer answers. To provide the participants with similar and impartial treatment, it would be\u00a0 better to have a feedback discussion with everybody by telephone in future studies. Participants also returned their feedback forms to the group facilitator, so some participants may have been reluctant to give critical feedback directly in this way. Further, it would be\u00a0 important to collect feedback from those participants who dropped out from the FWN group and compare them with those who stayed for the whole treatment.\nThe restrictions caused by the Covid pandemic interrupted some of the groups and meetings were moved online. Some of the participants also dropped out because of Covid. The pandemic came to everybody as a surprise, so it was not possible to prepare for it by the spring of 2020. In future, it\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 768372\nwould be\u00a0 important to inform participants beforehand that some or all meetings might be\u00a0 carried out online so as to reduce possible disappointments and dropouts."

            "text": "In the present study, participants\u2019 feedback on our new NBI for depression rehabilitation (FWN treatment) was qualitatively examined. The FWN treatment was based both on earlier research results in eco and environmental psychology (e.g., Salonen et\u00a0al., 2018), psychotherapeutic theories and professional psychologists\u2019 experiences in therapeutic work. The group-form intervention included holistic psychological methods that can be\u00a0repeated and which can be\u00a0developed and examined further in the future. The participants\u2019 experiences of the key elements of the social support, nature environment and FWN exercises, which differed at three separate stages, were mainly positive. This supports the inclusion of these key components in future intervention versions. In future, FWN exercises should be\u00a0 developed further to better enable participants\u2019 possibilities for concentration and being present in the moment (mindfulness), and exercises should be\u00a0 simplified to match the target group\u2019s cognitive abilities."
