    "abstractText": "Private enterprises play an increasingly important role in China. They can improve the totalfactor productivity (TFP) and help transform and upgrade industrial structures. This study uses data for private listed manufacturing companies from 2009 to 2017 to examine the effects of different types of subsidies on TFP. We also analyze the heterogeneity and specific mechanism of subsidy effects. We find that R&D subsidies and production subsidies positively affect private enterprises\u2019 TFP. Moreover, R&D subsidies and production subsidies lagged by one period can also significantly increase private enterprises\u2019 TFP. In terms of industry, R&D subsidies have more obvious effects on technology-intensive industries, while production subsidies have more significant effects on labor-intensive and capital-intensive industries. In terms of scale, R&D subsidies\u2019 effects on the TFP of medium-sized enterprises are the largest, while production subsidies have the greatest effect on small enterprises\u2019 TFP. Government subsidies increase private enterprises\u2019 TFP through two mechanisms: improving technological innovation capability and alleviating financing constraints. Our results suggest that governments should formulate different subsidy policies according to industry and enterprise scale.",

In this context, innovative green development has become a major direction for socioeconomic growth. It is necessary, therefore, to give full play to the role of innovation in leading economic development. Private enterprises play an important role in such innovation. For example, 80% of patent applications are made by private enterprises, among which more than 60% are invention patents, while new-product provision accounts for about 70% [1]. Meanwhile, the level of total-factor productivity (TFP) largely depends on innovation capability. Therefore, private enterprises also play an important role in\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263018 January 31, 2022 1 / 19\na1111111111 a1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Wang D, Sun Y (2022) The effect of different government subsidies on total-factor productivity: Evidence from private listed manufacturing enterprises in China.

In China, the overall TFP of enterprises is low and relatively slow [2\u20134]. Improving the productivity and innovation of private enterprises is therefore important and is a topic of concern to both researchers and the government.\nBecause of limitations in terms of credit funds, production technologies, and innovation\nexternalities, many firms lack the driving force needed to improve TFP [5,6]. Government subsidies can help overcome this by promoting technological progress and economic growth. As a traditional intervention policy, subsidies can compensate for market failures and promote the rapid development of industries. Government subsidies have been widely implemented not only in China but also in Europe and the United States [7].\nPrevious studies have mainly investigated the effects of government subsidies on enterprises\u2019\nTFP in terms of financing constraints, innovation incentives, and signaling effects [6,8,9]. Several studies have reported that government subsidies can increase enterprises\u2019 TFP by increasing enterprise liquidity and reducing fixed or marginal costs [5,6,10]. Others, by contrast, have reported negative effects, revealing that companies might use subsidies for projects other than R&D investment, thus making government subsidies likely to inhibit TFP [11\u201313]. Another possible reason for the negative effects of subsidies on TFP pertains to government motives, which may be distorted. Enterprises with government connections are often more likely to receive government subsidies; this type of selection bias can reduce the positive effects of subsidies [14]. Rent seeking and corruption can also distort government subsidies, leading to a loss of subsidy efficiency. Finally, some studies have found a nonlinear relationship between government subsidies and corporate TFP. Government subsidies can promote enterprises\u2019 TFP within a certain range, but there is no effect, or even a restraining effect on TFP when subsidies are beyond a reasonable range [15\u201317]. Overall, there are contradictory findings regarding subsidy effects, which may be attributable to factors such as the various definitions of government subsidies, measurement methods for TFP, or differences in sample selection.\nGovernments formulate different subsidy policies based on different policy objectives. The\neffects of these different subsidy policies on enterprises\u2019 technological innovation will be significantly different and will therefore have different effects on TFP. However, previous studies have not examined subsidies\u2019 effects on TFP in terms of different subsidy methods, which is a limitation of the existing literature. Previous studies have also neglected to demonstrate the effects of different subsidies on enterprises\u2019 TFP.\nThe present study, therefore, subdivides government subsidies into R&D subsidies and production subsidies. Using a sample of private listed companies in China, we examine the overall effects and heterogenous effects of different subsidies on enterprises\u2019 TFP and further explore the mechanisms of different subsidies. This study contributes to the literature in three aspects. First, we divide government subsidies into R&D and production subsidies and study their effects on private enterprises\u2019 TFP. Second, we conduct heterogeneity analyses at the industry and scale levels, which can provide a reference for evaluating the effects of government subsidy policies. Third, we select private listed manufacturing companies as the sample, reflecting a degree of novelty in sample selection.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets out the theoretical analysis and research\nhypotheses. Section 3 describes the data, variables, and empirical approach, while Section 4 presents the results and robustness tests. Section 5 concludes and discusses the policy implications."

            "text": "Technological innovation has diffusion and spillover effects, which can have positive effects on enterprises\u2019 TFP [18,19]. Specifically, technological innovation can change the proportion of\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263018 January 31, 2022 2 / 19\ninternal factor inputs in an enterprise, causing labor prices to rise and capital prices to fall. Therefore, enterprises will introduce advanced equipment to expand the scale of equipment investment and then use economies of scale to increase TFP. It has been noted that technological innovation can help improve resource allocation efficiency, thereby increasing the level of TFP [3]. However, technological innovation carries certain risks and uncertainties for enterprises. Government subsidies can compensate for externalities in enterprise innovation activities to some extent [20,21]. Yan and Wu [22], for example, found that government subsidies have significant positive effects on both substantive and strategic innovation. Specifically, government subsidies can improve the investment efficiency of R&D activities and TFP by providing enterprises with sufficient R&D funds and encouraging them to invest in innovative projects. Government subsidies not only reduce enterprises fixed and marginal costs but also promote innovation and TFP [5]. Liu and Zhao [23] found that government subsidy policies can promote the technological progress of new-energy vehicle companies. Carboni [24] found that government subsidies, especially R&D subsidies, can increase enterprises\u2019 R&D investment and thus enhance their productivity. Meng et al. [25], however, found that companies will increase R&D investment and enhance their innovation capabilities only when they receive sufficient product subsidies.\nGovernment subsidies can also increase enterprises\u2019 TFP by improving their innovation\nefficiency. Given the spillover effects of innovation activities, the private benefits of innovation activities are lower than social benefits, leading to a problem of insufficient investment in corporate innovation. Government subsidies, however, can improve the investment efficiency of corporate innovation activities and increase TFP [26].\nMeanwhile, R&D subsidies can promote TFP by improving operating efficiency, knowledge\nstock, and resource allocation efficiency. As the most direct way to support and guide industrial development, government subsidies are useful for improving business efficiency. They provide an important guarantee for improving operational efficiency [27]. By investigating the effect of outgoing officials\u2019 accountability audits of natural-resource assets on corporate innovation, Liu et al. [28] found that government subsidies can improve innovation investment efficiency and technological innovation levels. On the one hand, R&D subsidies can increase a company\u2019s knowledge stock and promote the adoption of new technologies and the upgrading of old technologies [29,30]. On the other hand, R&D subsidies can alleviate underinvestment in corporate innovation projects, improve the scale of enterprise R&D investment, and improve the efficiency of resource allocation [31,32].\nR&D subsidies mainly support enterprises\u2019 technological innovation activities and provide\nobvious incentives for such activities. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed:\nHypothesis 1: R&D subsidies increase private enterprises\u2019 TFP by promoting technological\ninnovation."

            "text": "Financing constraints limit the allocation of corporate resources and inhibit the scale of corporate investment, which will limit TFP growth [33,34]. Government subsidies can alleviate these financing constraints and help increase TFP [35]. Montmartin and Herrera [36] noted that government subsidies can reduce enterprises\u2019 transaction costs and fixed costs, thereby reducing their financing costs, improving their innovation capabilities and TFP. First, government subsidies provide direct financial support for enterprises, which will alleviate internal financing constraints and promote the development of economies of scale [37]. Grilli [38] found that\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263018 January 31, 2022 3 / 19\ngovernment subsidies can help increase enterprises\u2019 financing channels, reduce the pressure of financing constraints, and promote technological innovation and productivity improvement. Government subsidies also provide an implicit guarantee for enterprises\u2019 external financing, which sends a signal that an enterprise is developing well. This can enhance investor confidence and relieve external financing constraints to a certain extent [39]. Moreover, governments often grant subsidies to companies with higher innovation levels and better development prospects, which sends an economic signal to banks and other financial institutions. Subsidies can therefore broaden firms\u2019 financing channels and improve their investment efficiency. In addition, government subsidies can provide a certain price compensation for firms, which is conducive to forming price advantages and incentives for innovation in corporate management [40]. Finally, government subsidies can reduce enterprises\u2019 transaction costs and liquidity risks and thus promote innovation efficiency [41].\nCompared with other types of enterprises, private enterprises face serious financing obstacles in China, and such constraints negatively affect TFP [42]. Government production subsidies are mainly intended for enterprises\u2019 product-related activities (e.g., expanding production and markets). In this way, production subsidies can help improve enterprise investment efficiency and scale efficiency, thereby improving TFP [43]. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:\nHypothesis 2: Production subsidies increase the level of private enterprises\u2019 TFP by alleviating\nfinancing constraints.\nBased on the above theoretical analysis, we found that the effects of R&D subsidies and pro-\nduction subsidies on TFP, as well as the specific mechanisms of action, are quite different. However, previous studies have paid insufficient attention to the effects of different types of subsidies on enterprises\u2019 TFP. In addition, many studies only focus on the effect of government subsidies on overall enterprise technological innovation and TFP, without considering private enterprises as a separate research object. However, the role of private enterprises in China\u2019s economic development has become increasingly important, and it is therefore important to explore the effect of government subsidies on private enterprises\u2019 TFP. Finally, different types of enterprises are affected in different ways by different subsidy policies, which may account for inconsistencies in the research findings. Clarifying these issues is therefore of great importance for improving the effects of subsidy policies and promoting enterprise production efficiency. This study, therefore, uses a sample of Chinese private listed manufacturing companies covering 2009\u20132017 to investigate the effects of different types of government subsidies on enterprises\u2019 TFP and explore the mechanisms of different subsidies. Finally, we analyzed the heterogeneous responses of different types of enterprises to subsidy policies. This study provides a new research perspective for evaluating government subsidy policies. On the one hand, it can enrich and expand research on government subsidies and enterprises\u2019 TFP; on the other hand, it can provide policy implications for improving the effectiveness of government subsidy policies and increasing enterprises\u2019 TFP."

Including them in the analysis could result in biased, unrepresentative research conclusions. Second, before 2009, there were missing values for many key variables for private\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263018 January 31, 2022 4 / 19\nlisted companies. For example, the lack of intermediate input can cause problems in calculating TFP, and the lack of data on R&D intensity would make model estimation impossible. Further, insufficient data for company size, net profits, and time to list would make it impossible to calculate the relevant control variables. If those variables are not controlled for, the obtained policy effects will not be credible. Third, there is a great deal of missing government subsidy data and enterprise-level patent data for 2018\u20132020, making it difficult to estimate the effects of recent subsidy policies.\nThe industry classifications used in this study follow the 2012 China Securities Regulatory Commission\u2019s classifications. Government subsidy data and enterprise-level data come from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database. Macrolevel data are from the 2010\u2013 2018 China Statistical Yearbooks and Provincial and Municipal Statistical Yearbooks. Based on the literature, we processed the company data as follows: (1) exclude special treatment (ST)-share companies; (2) exclude companies listed after 2015 (due to a lack of data); (3) exclude companies with zero employees; (4) exclude companies with negative net fixed assets, total industrial output, and other indicators; and (5) exclude companies in Tibet (due to lack of data).

In the DEA-Malmquist index method, samples cannot be randomly selected, and the measurement results will be affected by random errors. Likewise, OLS will produce sample-selectivity bias and\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263018 January 31, 2022 5 / 19\nsimultaneity bias. Moreover, the OP method cannot estimate samples whose investment amount is zero or missing, leading to a loss of estimated samples. For these reasons, we selected the LP method to measure enterprises\u2019 TFP.\nBased on the C-D function, the introduction of intermediate input factors sets the TFP\nmodel as\nlnYit \u00bc b0 \u00fe bllnLit \u00fe bklnKit \u00fe bmlnMit \u00fe \u03b5it; \u00f04\u00de\nTFP \u00bc lnYit bllnLit bklnKit bmlnMit; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere Y and L are the main business income (million dollars) and the number of workers, respectively.

Referring to the literature, we used the keyword method to search for the specific project name in the government subsidy details [47]. Further, we distinguished R&D subsidies and production subsidies from the total subsides. R&D subsidies are subsidies that use technology, new products, R&D, and so on. Production subsidies are subsidies that use investment promotion, job stabilization, market development, and so on. S1 Table presents the specific classification methods.\n3.3.3 Mechanism variables. (1) enterprise innovation (R&D and Patent). These two variables have been widely used to measure enterprise innovation. In this study, innovation input is measured by enterprise R&D expenditure, while innovation output is measured by the total number of patents granted for utility, invention, and appearance. (2) Financing constraints (CF). Existing studies have used multiple indicators to measure financing constraints, such as the KZ index [48], WW index [49], and SA index [50]. The KZ and WW indexes have endogeneity problems [51]. To avoid such problems, we used the SA index to measure corporate financing constraints [50]. The formula for calculating the SA indicator is SA = \u22120.737 \u00d7 Size + 0.043 \u00d7 Size2\u20130.04 \u00d7 Age, where Size is the size of the company (measured by the logarithm of net fixed assets in millions of dollars), and Age is the age of the company. Since SA is a negative value, when the value is smaller, the financing constraints faced by the enterprise are more severe.\n3.3.4 Covariates. Following existing TFP research [52,53], we set the covariates as follows:\nEnterprise-level covariates include Enterprise size (Size), Enterprise age (Age), Capital structure (ALR), and Asset liquidity (Ass_liq). Regional-level covariates include Human capital (Per), Foreign investment (FDI), and Economic development (Per_gdp). Table 1 summarizes the names and definitions of the variables used in this study."

Therefore, supporting private enterprises\u2019 production subsidies to alleviate their financing difficulties may have a more direct stimulating effect on TFP. The control variables included in our model can help explain the variations in TFP. Enterprise size, asset liquidity, debt-to-asset ratio, and asset-liability ratio all have a positive effect on private enterprises\u2019 TFP, and all are significant at least at the 1% level. Regional economic development and human capital significantly affect private enterprises\u2019 TFP. This shows that the higher the level of economic development and the higher the quality of human capital, the larger the effect on TFP. Although enterprise age and foreign investment lack statistical significance, their effect on private enterprises\u2019 TFP is consistent with expectation. The results in Table 2 clearly show that different types of government subsidies have significant effects on private enterprises\u2019 TFP.

Both R&D and production subsidies have the greatest effects on technology-intensive industries. In addition, R&D subsidies have a greater effect on the TFP of technology-intensive industries than production subsidies.\n4.4.2 Scale heterogeneity. There may be differences in the sensitivity of private enter-\nprises of different sizes to government subsidies. Therefore, we examined the effect of government subsidies on private enterprises\u2019 TFP by dividing the sample into scales. Following the \u201cClassification of National Economic Industries (2017)\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Promotion of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,\u201d we divided enterprise scale into three types: large, medium, and small. Table 5 presents the results. The coefficients in columns (1), (3), and (5) are the effects of R&D subsidies on the TFP of differently sized enterprises. The effect coefficients of large and medium-sized enterprises are 0.003 and 0.006, respectively; they are at least below the 10% significance level. Further analysis shows that the effect of government R&D subsidies on small enterprises does not pass the significance test. It is widely known that government R&D subsidies tend to have the greatest incentivizing effects on the TFP of medium-sized private enterprises. As shown in columns (2), (4), and (6), the effect of production subsidies on the TFP of large and small enterprises passes the significance test. However, the coefficient of medium-sized private enterprises is not significant. Moreover, we found that government production subsidies have a more significant promotion effect on the TFP of small enterprises. Overall, R&D subsidies have the most obvious effects on medium-sized enterprises\u2019 TFP, while production subsidies have the greatest effect on small enterprises\u2019 TFP. Specifically, medium-sized enterprises have a certain degree of financial strength. They can efficiently use R&D subsidy funds to improve TFP. Meanwhile, since small enterprises mainly face financing problems, production subsidies can help alleviate financing difficulties and increase TFP through scale effects."

In this section, we test the mecha-\nnism of subsidies on TFP. The results are presented in Tables 6 and 7.\nAs shown in column (1) of Table 6, the effect of innovation input on private enterprises\u2019\nTFP is positively correlated at the 1% level. The coefficient of the interaction term between R&D subsidies and innovation input is 0.003 in column (2). This indicates that an innovation input mechanism exists between R&D subsidies and enterprises\u2019 TFP. The results in column (3) of Table 6 show that increasing the level of enterprise innovation output is conducive to increasing private enterprises\u2019 TFP. From column (4), we can see that the coefficient of the interaction term between R&D subsidies and innovation output is significantly positive. This indicates that an innovation output mechanism exists between R&D subsidies and private enterprises\u2019 TFP.\nThis study\u2019s findings are contrary to those of Bernini and Pellegrini [11]. This could be\nattributable to differences in government subsidies and the measurement of TFP. Our results are, however, consistent with those of many other studies. Hsieh and Klenow [3], for example, also found that government subsidies can improve enterprises\u2019 TFP by stimulating their enthusiasm for technological innovation. Sissoko [5] likewise noted that government subsidies can reduce enterprise innovation costs and risks, thereby increasing TFP. Carboni [24] also found that government subsidies can significantly promote enterprise R&D innovation and improve productivity. However, it should be noted that our results are more significant than those of previous studies. On the one hand, we studied the effect of R&D subsidies on enterprises\u2019 TFP, and the incentive effect of R&D subsidies on enterprises\u2019 R&D investment and technological innovation was found to be significant. On the other hand, improve the level of technological innovation, thereby making R&D subsidies more effective for promoting TFP. In summary, regardless of the indicators used to measure enterprises\u2019 technological innovation, R&D subsidies can significantly improve private enterprises\u2019 innovation levels, which in turn significantly promotes TFP, thus verifying H1.\nNote: t statistics are reported in parentheses; \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd p<0.01, \ufffd\ufffd p<0.05, \ufffd p<0.1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263018.t006\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263018 January 31, 2022 11 / 19\nWe tested the financing constraint mechanism of production subsidies on TFP, as shown\nin Table 7. The coefficient in column (1) is 0.154, and the significance level is 1%. Since SA is a negative value, the larger the SA, the better the financing constraints of the enterprise. Therefore, a smaller financing pressure has a positive effect on private enterprises\u2019 TFP. The coefficient of the interaction term between production subsidies and financing constraints is \u22120.002 in column (2), which is significant at the 1% level. As before, our conclusions are consistent with those of previous studies. Bernini and Cerqua [35] found that government subsidies can reduce the financing pressures of enterprises, reduce financing difficulty, and then increase TFP. Wang and Ai [40] suggested that government subsidies can provide price compensation for enterprises, reduce production and operation costs, and ultimately improve TFP. Furthermore, Wu [39] noted that government subsidies can broaden the financing channels of enterprises through implicit guarantees, reduce financing pressure, expand the scale of production and operations, and improve TFP. A production subsidy is a type of subsidy provided by the government to relieve enterprises\u2019 financing pressures and help them open up the market. Additionally, in China, private enterprises face more prominent financing problems. Production subsidies can therefore help alleviate financing constraints for private enterprises, improve their operating efficiency, and ultimately improve their TFP. The results in Table 7 indicate that production subsidies can effectively alleviate the financing constraints of enterprises and increase their TFP, thus verifying H2.\n4.5.2 Endogeneity test. Private enterprises\u2019 TFP may be affected by many factors; thus,\nendogeneity problems caused by missing variables may exist in the model. In addition, there could be a two-way causal relationship between government subsidies and the TFP of private enterprises, which might also lead to endogeneity. We aimed to find many instrumental variables. For example, the average value of different subsidies in industries other than the company\u2019s industry was used as an instrumental variable, but it did not pass the correlation and exogeneity tests. These tests are necessary conditions for suitable instrumental variables. Regrettably, we did not find a suitable instrumental variable to solve the endogeneity problem. Therefore, the instrumental variable estimation method is not suitable for this study. However, difference GMM and system GMM are common approaches used to deal with endogeneity\nNote: t statistics are reported in parentheses; \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd p<0.01, \ufffd\ufffd p<0.05, \ufffd p<0.1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263018.t007\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263018 January 31, 2022 12 / 19\nproblems in many studies [55\u201359]. Difference GMM can solve the deviation of the endogeneity problem to the estimation result to a certain extent, but it cannot observe the characteristics of individual heterogeneity, and there are seriously weak instrumental variables. However, system GMM can overcome the weaknesses of difference GMM and alleviate the problem of weak instrumental variables. Therefore, we used both difference GMM and system GMM to solve the endogeneity problem. Table 8 presents the results.\nIt can be seen from Table 8 that the effect of government subsidies on the TFP of private\nenterprises is consistent with the previous empirical results, again supporting H1. Moreover, the lag period of private enterprises\u2019 TFP has a positive effect on the TFP of the current period, indicating that the improvement of enterprises\u2019 TFP is a continuous process. The models in Table 8 pass the relevant tests of AR (2) and Sargan statistics, indicating that there is no overidentification problem, and the regression results are not affected by the second-order sequence. Thus, the differential GMM and system GMM methods are effective for this study, indicating that the estimated results of the model are reliable."

The meanings of the covariates and subscripts are the same as those of model (1). The coefficient \u03b11 in model (7) is the effect of R&D subsidies on private enterprises\u2019 TFP. The coefficient \u03b21 in model (8) is the effect of R&D subsidies on the mechanism variable. The coefficient \u03b32 in model (9) is the influence of the independent variables on TFP after controlling for the mechanism variables. Moreover, the coefficient \u03b31 is the effect of the mechanism variables on TFP after controlling for the influence of R&D subsidies.\nFrom column (2) of S4 Table, we can see that there is a positive relationship between the\nR&D subsidy and innovation input. In column (3), the coefficients of R&D subsidies and innovation inputs on TFP are 0.003 and 0.049, respectively, and both are significant at the 1% level. It can be considered that R&D subsidies increase TFP by stimulating private enterprises to increase investment in innovation. The mediating effect of innovation input exists and is part of the mediation.\nSecond, we use the same model to check the robustness of the mediating effect of innova-\ntion output. The results are reported in columns (4), (5), and (6) of S4 Table. As shown in column (5), the number of firms granted patents increases by 0.033% when R&D subsidies increase by 1%. In column (6), the coefficient of lnPatent is 0.011 and significant at the 1% level. In addition, the coefficients of lnSub_rd are smaller when compared with column (4) and significant at the 1% level. Thus, we can conclude that innovation output exists between R&D subsidies and TFP, and innovation output is also part of the mediation.\nFinally, we use financing constraints as an intermediary variable to test whether there is a\nfinancing constraint mechanism between production subsidies and TFP. The results are presented in S5 Table. Production subsidies can effectively alleviate the financing constraints of private enterprises. By incorporating production subsidies and financing constraints into the model, we found that both production subsidies and financing constraints have a significant positive effect on private enterprises\u2019 TFP. This indicates that production subsidies can effectively improve private enterprises\u2019 TFP by alleviating financing constraints. Therefore, the intermediary effect of financing constraints exists and is part of the mediation."

Moreover, R&D and production subsidies lagged by one\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263018 January 31, 2022 14 / 19\nperiod can also significantly increase private enterprises\u2019 TFP. Second, the effect of different subsidies on private enterprises\u2019 TFP varies among different industries. Both R&D subsidies and production subsidies have a greater effect on private enterprises\u2019 TFP in technology-intensive industries compared to other industries. Moreover, the effect of R&D subsidies on TFP in technology-intensive industries is greater than that of production subsidies. Third, government subsidies have different effects on enterprises of different sizes. R&D subsidies most obviously increase the productivity of medium-sized enterprises. Production subsidies have the greatest effect on promoting the productivity of small enterprises. Finally, although R&D and production subsidies play a significant role in promoting private enterprises\u2019 TFP, their mechanisms are different. R&D subsidies can increase TFP by stimulating enterprises to increase R&D investment and innovation output; meanwhile, production subsidies can improve TFP by easing enterprises\u2019 financing constraints and reducing their financial pressures.\nOur findings have important implications for understanding how to implement subsidy\npolicies. Empirical research shows that government subsidies are necessary. Therefore, China\u2019s government should continue to increase subsidies to private enterprises to encourage them to innovate and increase their TFP. However, the effects of R&D and production subsidies vary among different industries and at different scales. Based on our results, the government should increase R&D subsidies for technology-intensive industries and medium-sized enterprises. For labor-intensive industries, capital-intensive industries, and small enterprises, it is necessary to increase production subsidies to ease financing constraints in the development of private enterprises. In addition, private enterprises must make full use of subsidy policies to improve their innovation and investment efficiency and ultimately improve their TFP.\nThis study has several limitations. First, due to a lack of data, we only used listed\nmanufacturing companies as the analysis sample, which might produce biased estimates. Since listed companies represent high-quality companies in the same industry, government subsidies are more likely to have a positive effect on their TFP. In the future, it will be necessary to investigate the effect of subsidies on TFP based on different types of firm data. Second, we failed to find a suitable instrumental variable to deal with endogeneity. Hence, we used difference GMM and system GMM to solve the endogeneity problem; thus, our solution for the endogeneity problem might be imperfect. Future studies can improve our understanding of subsidies\u2019 effects on TFP by finding a suitable instrumental variable to deal with endogeneity. In summary, in the future, more types of data and better solutions for endogeneity problems need to be explored to provide additional insights.\nSupporting information"
