    "abstractText": "This study established a QuEChERS high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry method for determining azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, picoxystrobin, difenoconazole, chlorantraniliprole, imidacloprid, and cyantraniliprole and its metabolite (IN-J9Z38) in litchi and longan, and applied this method to the real samples. The residues in samples were extracted with acetonitrile and purified with nano-ZrO2, C18, and PSA. The samples were then detected with multireactive ion monitoring and electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode and quantified using the external matrix-matched standard method. The results showed good linearities for the eight analytes in the range of 1\u2013100 \u03bcg/L, with correlation coefficients (r2) of >0.99. The limit of quantification was 1\u201310 \u03bcg/kg, and the limit of detection was 0.3\u20133 \u03bcg/kg. Average recovery from litchi and longan was 81\u201399%, with the relative standard deviation of 3.5\u20138.4% at fortified concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg/kg. The developed method is simple, rapid, efficient, and sensitive. It allowed the rapid screening, monitoring, and confirming of the aforementioned seven pesticides and a metabolite in litchi and longan.",

            "text": "Litchi and longan are both vital economic fruit trees in tropical and subtropical regions of China. Their annual output in China ranks highest in the world [1\u20134]. Litchi is known as the \u201cking of fruits\u201d, and longan is known as \u201csouthern ginseng\u201d in China [5\u20138]. The high temperature and humidity in the planting areas of China make litchi and longan trees vulnerable to diseases and pests. At present, 140 pesticide products in litchi have been registered in China, including 48 active ingredients (10 insecticides, 23 fungicides, 1 herbicide, and 14 plant growth regulators) [9]. Seven pesticide products have been registered in longan, of which only 6 are active ingredients (2 insecticides, 1 fungicide, and 3 plant growth regulators) [9]. Most registered pesticides are pyrethroids, organophosphorus, triazole, and carbamate, and these chemical pesticides have been used for many years in litchi and longan orchards. The annual high-dose and frequent usage of pesticides has led to the prominent problems of resistance, pesticide residue pollution, and dose exceeding the standard in litchi and longan orchards [10]. The repeated use of chemical pesticides causes not only toxicity to fruits, but also environmental pollution and harm to non-target biological entities. For example, the rate of acute oral and contact toxicity of\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5737. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27175737 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5737 2 of 11\npyrethroid and organophosphorus insecticides to bees, fish, and birds is high [11\u201313]. An increasing number of studies have proven that fungicides could also harm the health of non-target organisms such as bees [14\u201316]. Triazole fungicides are classified as \u201cpotential human carcinogens\u201d by the US Environmental Protection Agency [17,18]. Consumers are also increasingly concerned about the health and pollution problems caused by pesticides and their metabolite residues. The toxicity of some pesticide metabolites may even be higher than that of the parent pesticide [19]. The fruit quality and safety and environmental problems caused by pesticides deserve attention. Hence, establishing a method for the simultaneous determination of pesticides and their metabolites in litchi and longan is valuable. At present, the main detection and analytical methods for the aforementioned pesticides are gas chromatography-electron capture detection (GC-ECD), gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and HPLCmass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) [20\u201332]. The main matrix includes vegetables such as broccoli and zucchini, fruits such as pears and apples, and traditional Chinese medicine [20\u201332]. Few studies have reported on multiresidue analysis of pesticides and their metabolites in litchi and longan. Common sample purification methods include solid phase extraction (SPE), liquid\u2013liquid distribution extraction, and QuEChERS [20\u201332]. SPE is a tedious and time-consuming method involving the use of a large amount of organic solvents and nitrogen blowing, which is relatively cumbersome. Many types of commercial SPE columns are available, but selecting suitable SPE column for multiresidue analysis is difficult. The dispersive liquid\u2013liquid extraction method requires a large amount of organic solvents and is prone to emulsification, which affects the recovery of target analytes. QuEChERS can achieve better purification with the addition of a small amount of adsorbent to the extraction solution to adsorb impurities. The operation of QuEChERS, which is currently a common purification method for fruits and vegetables, is fast and simple [33\u201336]. The main objectives of this paper are to establish and validate a fast and sensitive QuEChERS method employing a combination of nano-ZrO2, C18, and PSA for sample pretreatment before HPLC-MS/MS analysis for the simultaneous quantification of 7 pesticides and 1 metabolite in litchi and longan."
