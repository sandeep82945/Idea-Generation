1. **Investigate the impact of different aspect categories on the decision prediction task.** The paper considers eight aspect categories, but it is possible that different categories may have different levels of importance for different types of papers or conferences. Future research could explore how the model's performance changes when different aspect categories are included or excluded.


2. **Develop a method for automatically extracting aspect categories and sentiments from peer review texts.** The current study relies on manually annotated aspect and sentiment labels. However, it would be beneficial to develop a method for automatically extracting this information from the text, which would make the model more scalable and easier to use.


3. **Explore the use of other types of machine learning models for the decision prediction task.** The paper uses a deep neural network model, but other types of models, such as support vector machines or random forests, could also be used. Future research could compare the performance of different models to determine which one is best suited for this task.


4. **Investigate the use of additional features for the decision prediction task.** The current study only considers the text of the peer reviews. However, other features, such as the author's reputation, the journal's impact factor, or the number of citations the paper has received, could also be used to improve the model's performance.


5. **Develop a system that can provide real-time feedback to authors on the quality of their papers.** The model could be used to develop a system that provides real-time feedback to authors on the quality of their papers. This system could help authors to identify areas where their papers need improvement before they submit them for peer review.
