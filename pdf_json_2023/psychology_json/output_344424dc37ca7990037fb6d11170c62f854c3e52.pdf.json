    "abstractText": "Background Trichoderma reesei Rut-C30 is a hypercellulolytic mutant strain that degrades abundant sources of lignocellulosic plant biomass, yielding renewable biofuels. Although Zn2+ is an activator of enzymes in almost all organisms, its effects on cellulase activity in T. reesei have yet to be reported. Results Although high concentrations of Zn2+ severely suppressed the extension of T. reesei mycelia, the application of 1\u20134 mM Zn2+ enhanced cellulase and xylanase production in the high-yielding cellulase-producing Rut-C30 strain of T. reesei. Expression of the major cellulase, xylanase, and two essential transcription activator genes (xyr1 and ace3) increased in response to Zn2+ stimulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the mRNA levels of plc-e encoding phospholipase C, which is involved in the calcium signaling pathway, were enhanced by Zn2+ application. The disruption of plc-e abolished the cellulase-positive influence of Zn2+ in the early phase of induction, indicating that plc-e is involved in Zn2+-induced cellulase production. Furthermore, treatment with LaCl3 (a plasma membrane Ca 2+ channel blocker) and deletion of crz1 (calcineurin-responsive zinc finger transcription factor 1) indicated that calcium signaling is partially involved in this process. Moreover, we identified the zinc-responsive transcription factor zafA, the transcriptional levels of which declined in response to Zn2+ stress. Deletion of zafA indicates that this factor plays a prominent role in mediating the Zn2+-induced excessive production of cellulase. Conclusions For the first time, we have demonstrated that Zn2+ is toxic to T. reesei, although promotes a marked increase in cellulase production. This positive influence of Zn2+ is facilitated by the plc-e gene and zafA transcription factor. These findings provide insights into the role of Zn2+ in T. reesei and the mechanisms underlying signal transduction in cellulase synthesis.",

Expression of the major cellulase, xylanase, and two essential transcription activator genes (xyr1 and ace3) increased in response to Zn2+ stimulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the mRNA levels of plc-e encoding phospholipase C, which is involved in the calcium signaling pathway, were enhanced by Zn2+ application. The disruption of plc-e abolished the cellulase-positive influence of Zn2+ in the early phase of induction, indicating that plc-e is involved in Zn2+-induced cellulase production. Furthermore, treatment with LaCl3 (a plasma membrane Ca\n2+ channel blocker) and deletion of crz1 (calcineurin-responsive zinc finger transcription factor 1) indicated that calcium signaling is partially involved in this process. Moreover, we identified the zinc-responsive transcription factor zafA, the transcriptional levels of which declined in response to Zn2+ stress. Deletion of zafA indicates that this factor plays a prominent role in mediating the Zn2+-induced excessive production of cellulase.\nConclusions For the first time, we have demonstrated that Zn2+ is toxic to T. reesei, although promotes a marked increase in cellulase production. This positive influence of Zn2+ is facilitated by the plc-e gene and zafA transcription factor. These findings provide insights into the role of Zn2+ in T. reesei and the mechanisms underlying signal transduction in cellulase synthesis.\nKeywords Trichoderma reesei, Filamentous fungi, Zn2+ stimulation, Cellulase, Plc-e, zafA"

            "text": "The derivation of bioethanol from the degradation of lignocellulose is an important process [1, 2]. Saccharification, a vital step in the degradation of lignocellulose, is catalyzed by cellulases produced by filamentous fungi, such as Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus nidulans [3\u20135]. Given its excellent extracellular enzyme production, safety, and reliability, T. reesei is used industrially as a model strain for cellulase production [6, 7]. Xyr1, a global transcriptional activator, regulates the expression of cellulase and xylanase genes [8], and a disruption of xyr1 has been demonstrated to result in abrogation of the expression of almost all cellulase- and hemicellulase-encoding genes [9]. In 2014, a further important transcriptional activator, ace3, was reported to regulate the production of cellulase and xylanase [10]. Although the loss of ace3 was found to result in slight reductions in the expression of hemicellulases [11] and xylanases [12], it completely abolished cellulase production. *Correspondence: Wei Wang wadexp@ecust.edu.cn 1 The State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, 130 Meilong Road, P. O. Box 311, Shanghai 200237, China\nMicroorganisms sense their surroundings and respond to external signals via a network of signal transduction pathways that provide strict control of cellulase production [13]. Among such pathways, the calcium signaling pathway is essential and highly conserved in filamentous fungi [13].\nCa2+ play vital cellular roles as a ubiquitous second messenger regulating cell growth, virulence, and stress resistance [14], and is a core component of the calcium signal transduction pathway in filamentous fungi [15]. In T. reesei, Chen et\u00a0 al. [16] demonstrated that Mn2+ regulates cellulase gene expression via calcium signaling, and Xu et\u00a0al. [17, 18] have demonstrated that addition of Mn2+ and Na+ to liquid cultures of Ganoderma lucidum induces the biosynthesis of ganoderic acid via calcineurin signaling transduction. Subsequently, Gao et\u00a0 al. [19] revealed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ cross-regulate hyphal branching and ganoderic acid biosynthesis induced by Cu2+ in G. lucidum. The complete Ca2+ signaling pathway includes free Ca2+, calmodulin (Cam), calcineurin (Cna), and calcineurin-responsive zinc-finger transcription factor 1 (Crz1/CrzA), and in response to an increase in cytoplasmic concentrations of Ca2+, activation of Cam and Cna promotes the dephosphorylation of Crz1/CrzA, which acts on downstream pathway genes [20].\nCytosolic Ca2+ levels increase via two pathways, in the first of which, Ca2+ from the external environment enters the cytoplasm via ion channels in the cell membrane [21\u201323], whereas in the second, Ca2+ within the intracellular Ca2+ pool enters the cytoplasm via a PIPLC/IP3-mediated pathway [24]. In this latter pathway, phospholipase C (PLC) is activated in response to extracellular signals, promoting an increase in IP3 content, which subsequently leads to the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+ pool [25, 26]. According to Chen et\u00a0al. [15], plc-e can be activated by N, N-dimethylformamide, which promotes an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in T. reesei.\nZn2+ serves as an important structural or catalytic cofactor for numerous transcription factors (TFs) and enzymes, and is accordingly essential for almost all organisms, including fungi [27, 28]. A number of studies on Zn2+ metabolism have focused on pathogenic fungi, such as Candida albicans [29], Cryptococcus gattii [28], and Aspergillus fumigatus [30], in which Zn2+ facilitates normal growth and plays important roles in a range physiological processes [31]. Zap1, a zinc-responsive TF, was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which it controls Zn2+ homeostasis and adaptive responses to Zn2+ deficiency [32]. Homologous to S. cerevisiae Zap1 is\nthe transcriptional activator ZafA identified in A. fumigatus [33]. In a murine model of invasive aspergillosis, cells with loss of ZafA were found to be characterized by negligible virulence [33]. Schneider et\u00a0al. demonstrated that Zap1 (an ortholog of S. cerevisiae Zap1) plays a vital role in the regulation of Zn2+ homeostasis and modulation of virulence in C. gattii [28]. Comparatively, however, there have been few studies that have examined the role of zinc in non-pathogenic filamentous fungi.\nIn this study, we used the high-yielding RUT-C30 strain of T. reesei as a parent strain to study the mechanisms whereby extracellular Zn2+ induces cellulase production. We discovered that the addition of intracellular Zn2+ causes a significant increase in cellulase production and has a strong inhibitory effect on hyphal growth. Transcriptome analysis and gene deletion were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the Zn2+-induced cellulase production. In addition, we identified a zinc-responsive TF ZafA (an ortholog of S. cerevisiae Zap1 and A. fumigatus ZafA) in T. reesei and demonstrated its relevance with respect to cellulase production in response to Zn2+. The findings of this study provide important insights for further elucidation of the mechanisms whereby Zn2+ influences cellulase production in the filamentous fungi T. reesei."

As shown in Fig.\u00a0 1a, Zn2+ strongly inhibited hyphal growth. When the concentration of Zn2+ was increased to 1\u00a0 mM, growth was inhibited to a certain extent compared with the untreated strain (by approximately 25.4%) (Fig.\u00a01b). Compared with the untreated strain, treatment with 2\u00a0 mM Zn2+ led to a 66.9% reduction in colony diameter, and treatment with \u2265 3\u00a0mM Zn2+ suppressed virtually all colony growth. These results accordingly revealed that at higher concentrations, Zn2+ represents a stressor that inhibits T. reesei growth.\nGiven the effects of Zn2+ on the growth of strains, we adopted the transfer method in this study. Equal masses of T. reesei RUT-C30 pre-cultured mycelia were transferred to MM supplemented with 1% (w/v) Avicel as the sole carbon and different concentrations of Zn2+\n(0\u20135\u00a0mM) and incubated at 28\u2103 for 4\u00a0days to assess the effect of Zn2+ treatment on the production of cellulase, xylanase, and extracellular protein. As shown in Fig.\u00a02, the addition of 1\u20134\u00a0 mM Zn2+ promoted marked enhancements of cellulase, xylanase and extracellular protein per gram of T. reesei mycelium, annulling its negative effects on growth. Supplementation with 3\u00a0mM Zn2+ was found to have the most pronounced effects in this regard. Specifically, the addition of 3\u00a0mM Zn2+ stimulated pNPCase activity (representing exo-\u03b2-glucanase activity), which was enhanced by approximately 96.5% to 191.3% compared with the control without 3\u00a0mM Zn2+ supplementation (Fig.\u00a0 2a). As shown in Fig.\u00a0 2b, 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+ also promoted a significant increase in CMCase activity (representing endo-\u03b2-glucanase activity), by approximately 67.9% to 77.7% compared with that of the control. Furthermore, compared with the control, supplementation with 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+ resulted in approximate 46.9% and 82.6% increases in xylanase and filter paper hydrolase activities (FPase, representing total extracellular cellulase activity), respectively (Fig.\u00a02c, d). As illustrated in Fig.\u00a02e, we detected an approximate 92.8% increase in extracellular protein concentration in response to supplementation with 3\u00a0mM Zn2+ compared with the control strain. In contrast, exposure to 5\u00a0mM Zn2+ was found to have negative effects on CMCase, xylanase, and FPase activities, which we speculate could be attributed to the severe growth inhibition effects at high concentrations (Fig.\u00a02f ). Accordingly, in further studies, 3\u00a0mM Zn2+ was selected as the optimal concentration of for enhancing cellulase yields. To further investigate the effects of Zn2+ on cellulase and xylanase production, we determined the transcription levels of the four main cellulase genes (cbh1, cbh2, egl1, and egl2), one major xylanase gene (xyn1), and two essential transcriptional activators of cellulase and xylanase (xyr1 and ace3) using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Consistent with the aforementioned cellulase and extracellular protein results, we found that the addition of 3\u00a0mM Zn2+ promoted marked increases in the expression levels of the four main cellulase genes and one major xylanase gene by approximately 0.54- to 2.33-fold compared with the control at 60\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a03a\u2013e). Consistently, we detected a marked up-regulation of the transcriptional levels of xyr1 and ace3 at all assessed time points (Fig.\u00a03f, g). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Zn2+ supplementation has been demonstrated to promote a significant increase in the cellulase and xylanase production of T. reesei Rut-C30. However, the specific\ninduction mechanisms have yet to be sufficiently established and accordingly warrants further investigation.\nTranscriptomic changes in\u00a0T. reesei following\u00a0exposure to\u00a0 Zn2+ To further determine how Zn2+ influences T. reesei at the transcriptional level, we performed whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) using RUTC30 cultured for 48\u00a0 h in MM containing 0 or 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+, with 1% Avicel as the sole carbon source. We performed Illumina NovaSeq6000 RNA sequencing to analyze three independent biological samples from each of the assessed conditions. Following sequence quality control (41,388,676\u201354,546,188 reads, with no significant difference between parallel biological samples), the sequences of the total reads were mapped to the latest T. reesei reference genome (https:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ assem bly/ GCA_ 00200 6585.1) with a coverage of\n94.82\u201395.42%. The results of Pearson correlation analysis (r2 \u2265 0.718) revealed that there was a strong correlation between the three biological replicates of the strain with or without 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+ (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S1). Subsequently, we screened genes for differential expression between the two conditions based on the following thresholds: a Log2fold change (Log2fc) \u2265 1 and an adjected p-value < 0.05.\nAs shown in the volcano plot presented in Fig.\u00a0 4, in the presence of 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+, 852 genes were differentially expressed, of which 520 were upregulated and 332 were downregulated (3 mM_vs._0 mM; Fig.\u00a0 4a). Gene ontology (GO) annotation analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that the most enriched genes are associated with catalytic activity, membrane part, binding, and metabolic processes (Fig.\u00a0 4b). A histogram representing the findings of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that the most enriched pathways affected by Zn2+ included \u201cstarch and sucrose metabolism\u201d, \u201cfructose and mannose metabolism,\u201d \u201cprotein processing in endoplasmic reticulum,\u201d \u201cgalactose metabolism,\u201d \u201cpentose and glucuronate\ninterconversions,\u201d and \u201camino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism\u201d (Fig.\u00a04c). Collectively, the data indicated that in the presence of Zn2+, significant changes occurred in multiple signaling pathways, which are worthy of further investigation.\nAmong the 34 genes associated with cellulase and hemicellulose degradation in T. reesei, we detected upregulated transcriptional levels in 28 genes and downregulated levels in two (M419DRAFT_ 124931 and M419DRAFT_103113) (Table\u00a0 1). Notably, we detected marked increases (Log2fc \u2265 2) in the mRNA levels of two main cellobiohydrolases (CEL7A and CEL6A), two endoglucanases (CEL7B and CEL45A), one cellulosebinding protein CIP1 (M419DRAFT_121449) [34], swollenin (M419DRAFT_104220) [35], one xylanase (XYN3), mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase MAN1 (M419DRAFT_122377), and alpha-galactosidase AGL3 (M419DRAFT_39277). Additionally, 15 TFs are known to be associated with cellulase and hemicellulase expression, of which three are positive transcription regulators with increased mRNA levels (xyr1, ace3, and vib1 [37]) and one is a negative transcription regulator with\nreduced mRNA levels (rce1 [36]) (Table\u00a02). These results are consistent with the marked increases in pNPCase, CMCase, xylanase, and FPase activities and RT-qPCR data for RUT-C30 cells treated with 3\u00a0mM Zn2+.\nPLC\u2011E is\u00a0required for\u00a0 Zn2+ induction of\u00a0cellulase production Metal ions have been reported to regulate cellulase gene expression via calcium signaling in T. reesei [16], and consequently, we speculated as to whether calcium signaling would be involved in Zn2+-induced cellulase expression. To verify this conjecture, we determined the mRNA levels of four major calcium signal pathway-related genes based on transcriptional profiling (Table\u00a03). Notably, we detected a significant increase in the mRNA levels of plce encoding a phospholipase C protein, which can be activated by extracellular receptors, and induces the release\nof calcium from internal stores via the generation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) [37].\nFurthermore, to determine whether plc-e plays an important role in Zn2+-induced excessive production of cellulase, plc-e was deleted in T. reesei RUT-C30 to obtain the mutant strain \u0394plc-e. Interestingly, the facilitation effect of Zn2+ on cellulase synthesis in \u0394plc-e was initially suppressed during the early phase (36\u00a0h for qPCR and 2\u00a0 days for activities) and effectively attenuated in the latter phase (Fig.\u00a0 5a\u2013f), thereby providing evidence to indicate that plc-e is involved in the Zn2+ induction process. In the absence of Zn2+, the loss of plc-e promoted a slight enhancement of pNPCase and CMCase activities, whereas in the presence of Zn2+, we detected reductions in pNPCase and CMCase activities in \u0394plc-e compared with those in the parental RUT-C30 (Fig.\u00a0 5a,\nb). Collectively, these findings indicate that the deletion of plc-e effectively attenuates the induction effect of Zn2+ on cellulase production. Similar findings were obtained with respect to the transcriptional levels of cbh1, cbh2, egl1, and egl2 (Fig.\u00a05c\u2013f).\nOn the basis of transcription profiling, we established that the transcriptional levels of the calcium signaling genes (cam and crz1) were slightly enhanced in the presence of Zn2+ (Table\u00a0 3). RT-qPCR was used\nto quantitatively determine differences in the expression levels of these genes in the presence and absence of 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+. As shown in Additional file\u00a0 2: Fig. S2, the transcriptional levels of cam were slightly enhanced after 36\u00a0h of treatment with Zn2+.\nTo evaluate whether calcium signal transduction plays a role in the Zn2+ induction process, we used LaCl3 (a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker) to inhibit the influx of external Ca2+ [38], and we generated the crz1"

Analyses of cellulase activities (pNPCase and CMCase activities) and transcriptional levels of key cellulase genes (cbh1 and egl1) revealed that treatment with LaCl3 led to a marked reduction in cellulase activity and the transcriptional levels of cbh1 and egl1 compared with those in the no-LaCl3 control, regardless of the presence of Zn2+ (Additional file\u00a03: Fig. S3). Furthermore, in the presence of LaCl3, the facilitation effect of Zn2+ on cellulase synthesis was significantly attenuated during the early phase of induction (2 to 3\u00a0days) (Additional file\u00a03: Fig. S3a, b). Quantitative analysis using RT-qPCR revealed that exposure to LaCl3 had a slightly negative effect on Zn2+-induced cbh1 and egl1 expression (Additional file\u00a0 3: Fig. S3c, d). Collectively, these findings wound tend to indicate that calcium signal\ntransduction is partially involved during the early phase of the Zn2+ induction process.\nAlthough the calcium signaling pathway was blocked in the crz1 deletion strain, we found that supplementation with 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+ could still enhance the pNPCase and CMCase activities in this strain compared to those observed in the control (without 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+) on day 4 (Additional file\u00a0 4: Fig. S4a, b). Similar results were obtained in the RT-qPCR analysis (Additional file\u00a0 4: Fig. S4c, d), thus indicating that in addition to the calcium signaling pathway, other pathways are involved in Zn2+-induced cellulase synthesis."

            "text": "zafA In fungi, zinc-responsive TFs play important roles in regulating zinc homeostasis [32, 33]. In this regard, the TF zafA has been extensively studied in S. cerevisiae [39], C. gattii [28], and A. fumigatus [33]. NCBI BLAST analysis revealed that M419DRAFT_96242 detected in T. reesei in the present study is a homolog of the zafA in S. cerevisiae and A. fumigatus. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis revealed a slight, although significant, reduction in the mRNA levels of M419DRAFT_96242 (zafA) following exposure to 3\u00a0mM Zn2+ compared with the control group (0\u00a0mM Zn2+) (Additional file\u00a05: Table\u00a0S1). As revealed by RT-qPCR, compared with the control, the transcription levels of M419DRAFT_96242 (zafA) were downregulated\nby 48.99% in response to 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+ supplementation (Additional file\u00a06: Fig. S5).\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a06a, six zinc-finger C2H2 domains containing 702 amino acids were predicted in zafA using the Pfam database (http:// pfam. xfam. org). Phylogenetic analysis (Fig.\u00a06b) based on the zafA protein sequence revealed that zafA homologs are widely distributed in a range of Ascomycota, including Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes, with high amino acid similarity. In addition, zafA homologs have been identified in numerous Trichoderma species, indicating that this protein may have a conserved function. However, the roles of zafA in strain growth and cellulase production\n(in either T. reesei or other cellulose-degrading species) under conditions of zinc stress have yet to be evaluated.\nZafA mediates Zn2+\u2011stimulated excessive production of\u00a0cellulase in\u00a0the\u00a0RUT\u2011C30 strain To determine whether the reduced expression of zafA is associated with the Zn2+ induction process, we generated a zafA deletion strain (\u2206zafA) in which the signal transduction pathway was blocked. We investigated the effects of the parental strain RUT-C30 and \u2206zafA mutants on cellulase production in response to 0 and 3\u00a0mM Zn2+ treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a07a, b, the deletion of zafA resulted in a marked reduction or complete\ninhibition of Zn2+-induced cellulase production compared with the control. In the absence of 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+ supplementation, we detected no clear differences between the two strains with respect to pNPCase and CMCase activities. Compared with the parental strain RUT-C30 in the absence of 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+, we detected marked enhancements of approximately 160.4% and 70.4% in pNPCase and CMCase activities, respectively, following exposure to 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+. However, with the deletion of zafA, we detected notably less pronounced increases in pNPCase and CMCase activities of 46.4% and 23.4%, respectively, following exposure to Zn2+ pressure compared with no Zn2+ supplementation. Additionally, RT-qPCR was performed to determine the transcription levels of four major cellulase-encoding genes (cbh1, cbh2, egl1, and egl2) in T. reesei RUT-C30 and \u2206zafA, and we accordingly found the transcript levels to be consistent with the cellulase activity data. The significant enhancement of the transcriptional levels of these four cellulase genes induced by Zn2+ was effectively attenuated by the deletion of zafA (Fig.\u00a07c\u2013f ). In summary, these findings indicate that Zn2+ induces an enhancement of cellulase production in T. reesei RutC30 primarily via zafA, and this enhancement effect induced by Zn2+ was effectively prevented in the \u2206zafA mutant, in which the associated signaling pathway was blocked. DEGs associated with\u00a0G\u2011protein\u2011coupled receptors and\u00a0transporters The transfer of extracellular signals to intracellular sites generally requires transport mediated by G-proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) [40] and transporters [41]. To date 58 GPCRs have been reported in T. reesei [42], of which we detected the up- and downregulation of 14 and three, respectively, in response to treatments in the present study (Additional file\u00a07: Table\u00a0S2). These 17 differentially expressed GPCRs included one class III GPCR, one class V GPCR, two class VI GPCR, one class VII GPCR, one class XI GPCR, and 11 PTH11-like GPCRs, among which, 10 of the 11 PTH11-like GPCRs were downregulated, the exception being M419DRAFT_76201. In\naddition, among 152 transporters, we detected 44 differentially expressed DEGs, among which 31 and 13 were up- and downregulated genes, respectively (Additional file\u00a08: Table\u00a0S3). The stp1 (M419DRAFT_136988) gene, which was notably upregulated by 21.18 (2.27)-fold, has been established to be associated with cellobiose transport [43]. In addition, we identified one Fe2+/Zn2+regulated transporter (M419DRAFT_91910) that was markedly downregulated by 24.29 (19.56)-fold.\nCollectively, these findings provide convincing evidence to indicate that 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+ promotes notable changes in transcription and signal transduction in T. reesei."

            "text": "In this study, we sought to examine the effects of Zn2+ on the growth, enzyme production, and regulatory signaling pathways of T. reesei. Although Zn2+, a key cofactor of numerous TFs and enzymes, has been widely studies in filamentous fungi [30], yeasts (S. cerevisiae) [39, 44], plants, and animals [45], to the best of our knowledge, there have been no published studies on the properties of Zn2+ in T. reesei. In this study, we found that strain growth on solid medium was substantially inhibited in the presence of > 2\u00a0mM Zn2+ (Fig.\u00a01), thereby indicating that T. reesei was subjected to heightened stress. In S. cerevisiae, excessive Zn2+ has been found to cause oxidative\ndamage to cells by regulating the expression of antioxidant defense genes [27]. In T. reesei, it has been found that in response increases in the concentrations of Ca2+, Mn2+, and Sr2+ to 100\u00a0mM, 40\u00a0mM, and 120\u00a0mM, respectively, the strain growth is generally slow and sparse [16, 20, 46]. In Ganoderma lucidum, hyphal branch length and growth have been observed to be significantly reduced in the presence of 5\u00a0 mM Cu2+ [19], whereas treatment with 17\u00a0mM Ca2+ was found to result in a substantial reduction in the diameter of Penicillium brevicompactum colonies [49]. The findings of these studies indicate that fungi have specific tolerance to metal ions.\nWe found that exposure of T. reesei to Zn2+ promoted increases in production of the enzymes cellulase and xylanase, with maximal enhancement being recorded in those fungi treated with 3\u00a0mM Zn2+, a finding which would be beneficial from the perspective of industrial production (Fig.\u00a0 2). In this regard, recent studies have demonstrated that extracellular supplementation with metal ions can promote the production of primary and secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi [16\u201319, 46]. On the basis of transcriptome analyses, we discovered that 852 genes were differentially expressed in T. reesei treated with 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+, including a number of upregulated cellulase- and hemicellulose-associated genes (3 mM_vs._0 mM; Fig.\u00a0 4a and Table\u00a0 1), which is consistent with our RT-qPCR data (Fig.\u00a03). Importantly, we found that the transcription levels of intracellular plc-e were significantly elevated in response to stimulation with Zn2+, whereas the deletion of plc-e from the parental strain (Rut-C30) resulted in an attenuation of Zn2+-induced cellulase production during the early phase of the Zn2+ induction process (Fig.\u00a0 5). Previous studies have shown that plc-e is involved in regulating the expression of cellulase and Ca2+ signaling genes in T. reesei under the stimulation of extracellular signals [6, 15]. In the present study, we detected a slight enhancement in the mRNA levels of genes associated with the Ca2+ signaling pathway in response to treatment with Zn2+, (Table\u00a03), thereby indicating that plc-e might play a role in the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ pools. Treatment with LaCl3 and deletion of crz1 to block cytosolic Ca2+ signaling indicated that calcium signal transduction is partially involved in the early phase of Zn2+ induction, thereby implying the involvement of other pathways in the Zn2+-induced excessive production of cellulase (Additional file\u00a03: Fig. S3, Additional file\u00a04: Fig. S4), which warrants further investigation.\nZafA, an important transcription factor, plays a key role in maintaining Zn2+ homeostasis, which has been shown\nto be associated with gliotoxin biosynthesis in A. fumigatus [30]. In the present study, RNA-seq analysis revealed that the expression of one zinc-finger protein was significantly downregulated in response to treatment with Zn2+ (Additional file\u00a0 5: Table\u00a0 S1). On the basis of an NCBI blastx search, we established that this protein is homologous to zap1 in S. cerevisiae [39] and zafA in A. fumigatus [33], and we accordingly designated the protein zafA. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that zafA is expressed in a range of fungi, particularly species in the genus Trichoderma (Fig.\u00a0 6b). With respect to fungi, transcription factors have been studied primarily in pathogenic species such as A. fumigatus [47] and C. albicans [48]. To date, however, the role of zafA in Zn2+ homeostasis has yet to be reported in cellulase-producing strains. In the present study, we demonstrated that following the deletion of zafA, the efficacy of Zn2+ in promoting cellulase production and the expression of cellulase-related genes was markedly attenuated, and in some case was completely inhibited (Fig.\u00a07). Collectively, these observations would thus tend to indicate that zafA plays a prominent role in T. reesei when subjected to Zn2+ stress.\nExposure of T. reesei Rut-C30 to sufficiently high concentrations of Zn2+ was found induce stress-like responses in the fungi, and consequently, we examined the expression levels of two major antioxidant enzymes (sod1 and cat1 [46]) in response to 3\u00a0 mM Zn2+ treatment based on RT-qPCR. We accordingly found that the mRNA levels of sod1 were markedly enhanced at 36\u00a0h and 60\u00a0h, which was not substantially altered by the addition of Zn2+ at 48\u00a0h (Additional file\u00a09: Fig. S6). Contrastingly, the levels of cat1 were observed to undergo a gradual, albeit marked, decline with time (Additional file\u00a0 9: Fig. S6). These findings thus provide evidence indicating that cells were subjected to oxidative stress in response to treatment with Zn2+. Similar findings have been reported for S. cerevisiae, in which elevated levels of intracellular ROS have been detected in zinc-sensitive mutants exposed to high Zn2+ stress [27]. In our previous study, we established that exposure to 70\u00a0 mM Sr2+ promoted a ROS burst and associated increases in the expression of sod1 and cat1 in T. reesei [46]. Similarly, Chen et\u00a0 al. [49] demonstrated that the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzyme genes in P. brevicompactum were markedly upregulated in response to Ca2+. Treatment with metal ions exposes T. reesei Rut-C30 to stress, in response to which there is an upregulated expression of antioxidant genes to cope with the danger, and in our aforementioned previous study, we demonstrated that a ROS scavenger can alleviate intracellular ROS promoted\nby exposure to Sr2+ to enhance cellulase production [46]. In further studies, we accordingly intend to examine the effects of simultaneous treatment with Zn2+ and ROS scavengers on cellulase hyperproduction in RUT-C30.\nIn the presence of Zn2+, we detected a significant enhancement in the transcription levels of xyr1 and ace3 (Fig.\u00a03f, g and Table\u00a02), which are vital positive transcription activators that regulate cellulase gene expression in T. reesei [9, 12]. It is reasonable to speculate that zafA enhances the transcription of cellulase genes or associated activators. However, further studies will be necessary to establish the mechanisms underlying zafA recognition of the promoter sequences of these genes. Furthermore, we also detected the prominently enhanced expression of vib1 (Table\u00a02), the deletion of which had the effect of reducing the expression of almost all cellulase and hemicellulase genes, vital sugar transporter genes, and the primary transcriptional activators xyr1 and ace3 in T. reesei [49]. In this regard, it has been found that in Neurospora crassa, Vib1 modulates cellulase synthesis by regulating the expression of the essential cellulase regulator CLR2 [50]. In the present study, we found the upregulation of vib1 to be consistent with the activation of xyr1 and ace3 in response to Zn2+. Furthermore, Zn2+ stimulation was found to be associated with the differential\nexpression of 17 GPCRs and 44 transporter genes, which accordingly warrant further investigation with respect to their role in altered membrane signaling."

In addition, we identified a transcription factor, zafA, associated with Zn2+ homeostasis, which was found to play a prominent role in Zn2+-induced excessive production of cellulase.

All strains of T. reesei were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates in the dark at 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Fresh conidia were collected using glycerin for subsequent analyses. MM, which was used to assess the effect of Zn2+ on cellulase production and hyphal growth, contained (g/L) (NH4)2SO4 (5), urea (0.3), KH2PO4 (15), CaCl2 (0.6), MgSO4 (0.6), MnSO4\u00b7H2O (0.0016), FeSO4\u00b77H2O (0.005), and CoCl2\u00b76H2O (0.002), pH 5.5, with 1% (w/v) Avicel or 2% (w/v) glucose as the sole carbon source. Conidia (2 \u00d7 106) were grown for 36\u00a0 h at 28\u00a0\u00b0C in 100\u00a0mL of MA medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose as the sole carbon source (220\u00a0 rpm). Equal amounts of mycelia (approximately 0.1\u00a0 g) were collected and washed thoroughly using 20\u00a0mL of fresh MM lacking a carbon source, and then transferred to 50\u00a0 mL of fresh MM containing 1% (w/v) Avicel, with the addition of 0\u20135\u00a0mM ZnCl2. After 2\u20134\u00a0days of culture, samples were collected for enzymatic activity and protein concentration determinations. Mycelia induced for 36, 48, or 60\u00a0h were collected and maintained frozen at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C for subsequent RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analyses.\nConstruction of\u00a0T. reesei \u0394plc\u2011e, \u0394zafA, and\u00a0\u0394crz1 mutants In this study, RUT-C30 was used as the parent strain for gene knockout. A pEASY\u00ae-Uni Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit (TransGen, Shanghai, China) was used to construct deletion cassettes for deletion of the plc-e, zafA, and crz1 genes. The primers used for plasmid construction and diagnostic PCR are listed in Additional file\u00a010: Table\u00a0S4. Specifically, 722-bp upstream and 757- bp downstream fragments of plc-e were generated from the RUT-C30 genome using KOD-Plus-Neo (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). Initially, the upstream fragment obtained by PCR was ligated into PacI- and XbaI-linearized LML2.1 [53] to generate pFplc-e. Subsequently, the downstream fragment was inserted into the SwaI sites of pFplc-e to the generate deletion binary pDplc-e\n(Additional file\u00a011: Fig. S7). Similarly, the deletion cassettes of zafA and crz1 were amplified and inserted into LML2.1 to generate the deletion vectors pDzafA and pDcrz1, respectively. Deletion cassettes were used to transform T. reesei RUT-C30 to facilitate the knockout of plc-e (\u0394plc-e mutant), zafA (\u0394zafA mutant), and crz1 (\u0394crz1 mutant) using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [54]. The xylose-induced Cre recombinase system was used to self-excise the hygromycin-resistant cassette [55]. Primers XX-CF, XX-CR, XX-OF, and XX-OR (XX represents the gene name) were used in diagnostic PCR to verify the putative gene disruption mutants generated by double crossover.\nFungal growth and\u00a0cellulase, xylanase, protein, and\u00a0biomass production For fungal hyphal growth assays, glycerin was used to collect fresh conidia, which were diluted to 2.5 \u00d7 106\u00a0 mL\u22121 in sterile water. An equal volume of diluted conidia (2 \u03bcL) was inoculated onto the center of MM plates containing 2% (w/v) glucose and incubated for 4\u00a0 days at 28\u00a0 \u00b0C. Cellulase, xylanase, protein, and biomass production assays were performed as previously described [46, 56].\nRNA isolation and\u00a0quantitative real\u2011time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2011qPCR) The mRNA levels of specific gene mRNAs were assessed using RT-qPCR, as described by Cai et\u00a0 al. [52]. Briefly, total RNA from 100\u00a0mg of T. reesei mycelia was extracted using a FastRNA Pro Red Kit (MPbio, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For reverse transcription, we used TransScript\u00ae All-in-One FirstStrand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix for qPCR (One-Step gDNA Removal) (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) was used to reverse-transcribe 800\u00a0ng of total RNA to produce cDNA. RT-qPCR was performed using PerfectStart\u2122 Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen Biotech) with 1\u00a0\u03bcL of cDNA and 200\u00a0 nM of the forward and reverse primers in a final volume of 20 \u03bcL. The sequences of the primers used in the RT-qPCR analysis are shown in Additional file\u00a010: Table\u00a0S4. For gene transcription analysis, the sar1 gene was used as the reliable reference in SYBR Green assays as previously described [57]. For RT-qPCR analysis, thermocycling was performed using an ABI StepOne thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)."
