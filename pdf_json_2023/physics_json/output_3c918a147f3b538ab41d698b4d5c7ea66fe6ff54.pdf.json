    "abstractText": "Lichens are important sources of versatile bioactive compounds. Two new dibenzofurans (1\u20132), a multi-substituted single benzene ring (3), and two organic acid compounds (4\u20135) along with 25 known compounds (6\u201330) were isolated from the lichen Usnea diffracta Vain. Their structures were identified by physicochemical properties and spectral analyses. Compounds 1\u201330 were tested for inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans by the disk diffusion method and microdilution assay respectively. Compound 3 showed moderate inhibitory activities against S. aureus and E. coliwith the inhibition zone (IZ) of 6.2 mm and 6.3 mm, respectively. Depside 10 exhibited good activity against S.aureus and C. albicans with 6.6 mm and 32 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of compounds 1, 2, and 6\u20138 with the characteristic dibenzofuran scaffold were evaluated var anti-AChE assay and a molecular docking study. Compound 2 could better inhibit AChE at the concentration of 0.3 \u03bcmol/ml with a value of 61.07 \u00b1 0.85%. The molecular docking study also demonstrated that compound 2 had the strongest binding affinity among the five dibenzofurans, and the \u201c-CDOCKER Energy\u201d value was 14.4513 kcal/mol.",

Lichens have a remarkable ability to survive in extreme environmental conditions ranging from deserts to polar areas. Their specific secondary metabolites can protect them from physical and biological attacks (Reddy et al., 2019; Popovici et al., 2022). Lichens are not only ecologically important but also significant medicinal natural product resources, especially phenolic secondary metabolites, including phenols (orinol), dibenzofurans (usnic acid and its derivatives), depsidones (norstictic acid), depsides (diffractaic acid), depsones (picrolichenic acid), and pulvinic acid derivatives (vulpinic acid). There are about 26,000 species of lichens belonging to 500 genera in the world, among which more than 360 Usnea species are found (Salgado et al., 2018).\nUsnea diffractaVain, belonging to the genusUsnea, is widely used as a folk medicine for the treatment of diarrhea, stomachache, ulcer, tuberculosis, pneumonia, malaria, wounds, and"

Depsidones, depsides, depsones, quinones, polyphenolics, polysac-charides, and dibenzofurans are the main compounds of Usnea (Salgado et al., 2018). Previous studies have showed numerous good pharmacological activities ofU. diffracta, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular protective, antigenotoxic, and antiproliferative effects (Behera et al., 2012; Lai et al., 2013; Ceker et al., 2015; Koparal, 2015; Nishanth et al., 2015; Singh S. et al., 2016; Vanga et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017). It is noteworthy that most of these pharmacological activities are attributed to the availability of bioactive depsides and dibenzofuran derivatives (especially usnic acid) (Sun et al., 2016). Usnea diffracta and its major constituent usnic acid are potent antimicrobial agents to inhibit growth of different planktonic bacteria and fungi strains (Helena et al., 2012).\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a serious degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, characterized by a variety of symptoms, including memory loss, emotional behavior, and cognitive impairment (Singh et al., 2013). One of its pathogeneses mainly includes cholinergic system damage. The cholinergic system of AD patients involves two main cholinesterases (ChE), acetylcholin-esterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (ColovicMirjana et al., 2013). AChE inhibitors mainly act on the catalytic active site (CAS) at the bottom of AChE, which can relieve the symptoms of mild-to-moderate AD patients (Zhu et al., 2019). At present, cholinesterase inhibitors are mainly selective acetycholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) such as tacrine, donepezil, and galantamine (Greig et al., 2005; Furukawa-Hibi et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2016). These drugs have greater side effects or lower response rates in the long-term treatment of patients with mild-tomoderate AD. In order to find natural lead compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, benzofurans, as an important pharmacophore, have received extensive attention in the past few years because of their attractive cholinesterase inhibitory activity (Rizzo et al., 2012; Khanam\nand Shamsuzzaman, 2015; Delogu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017). The bibenzofuran structures of usnic acid derivatives are similar to those of galantamine, an anticholinesterase drug for AD. Usnic acid enantiomers show antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, which are involved in AD pathogenesis (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2015; Cazarin et al., 2020).\nHence, in the current research, 30 compounds including five new compounds were isolated and identified from U. diffracta. The complete isolation and structural elucidation of all compounds and their antimicrobial activities against two pathogenic bacteria including one Gram-positive strain (Staphylococcus aureus) and one Gramnegative bacterial strain (Escherichia coli) and fungus strain (Candida albicans) were described. Among them, the inhibitory activities on AChE of usnic acid derivatives 1, 2, and 6\u20138 were reported. The interaction between these compounds and the active centers of AChE were investigated by molecular docking."

The coupling constants at \u03b4 3.10 and 3.15 are both 15.4 Hz, which is speculated to be a carbon coupling hydrogen signal. The 13C NMR spectrum showed 24 carbon resonances that consisted of three carbonyl signals (\u03b4 202.8, 200.0, and 194.1), aromatic carbon signals and alkene carbon signals (\u03b4 161.2, 163.8, 158.5, 107.6, 106.8, 106.5, and 102.3), the chemical shifts 176.2 and 176.1 may contain carboxyl signals, as well as oxycarbon and aliphatic carbon signals. According to the DEPT 135 spectra (Supplementary Figure S11), five methylenes (\u03b4 60.7, 44.2, 43.7, 31.7, and 25.4) were existed in compound 1. The HSQCs (Supplementary Figure S8) indicated directly linked hydrocarbon correlations.

The HMBCs (Figure 2; Supplementary Figure S9) from \u03b4H 1.55 to \u03b4C 200.0/111.6/107.6/ 61.2 indicated that the angular methyl group was located at C-9b, while those from \u03b4H 2.55 to \u03b4C 102.3/202.8 suggested that C-14 was connected to C-6. The correlations from \u03b4H 2.52 to \u03b4C 106.8/ 176.1 established the connection of C-11 with C-2. The HMBCs from \u03b4H 3.88/3.87 to \u03b4C 15.7/111.6 suggested the connection of an ethoxy group at C-4a and from \u03b4H 2.43/1.94\u20132.01 to \u03b4C 176.2 and \u03b4H 3.59 to \u03b4C 176.1 revealed the presence of a C-2 enamine moiety in compound 1.

In addition, the CD spectrum (Supplementary Figure S2) of compound 1 was compared with the related literature previously published (Yu X. et al., 2016). Compound 1 presented one negative maximum at 298 nm and positive at 278 nm, which was consistent with the CD spectrum of Usneamine B, indicating that the absolute configuration of compound 1 was 4aR/9bR, as represented in Figure 2.

The results suggested that compound 2 formed four hydrogen bondings to key residues, namely, two hydrogen atoms of C2\u2019 to Tyr124 (2.45 \u00c5 and 2.35 \u00c5) at PAS, C4\u2032COOH to Phe295 (2.08 \u00c5) at acyl pocket, C7-OH to Tyr133 (2.33 \u00c5) at anionic subsite.

            "text": "Usnea is a kind of lichen traditional Chinese medicine with highmedicinal value, distributed in polar and tropical regions, and widely distributed in Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Heilongjiang, and other places in China. There are more than 10 common species, such asU. diffractaVain,U. cavernosa Tuck, andU. longissimaAch, among which U. longissima Ach is a large species studied widely (Salgado et al., 2018; Ullah et al., 2019). The phytochemistry of the Usnea genus show that it contains more than 60 compounds, which mainly belong to depsides, depsidones, depsones, lactones, quinones, phenolics, polysaccharides, fatty acids, and dibenzofurans (Salgado et al., 2018). Among them, depsides, depsidones, depsones, and dibenzofurans are the unique phenolic components of lichens. These representative aromatic products are compounds derived from the acetyl-polymalonyl pathway, the most characteristic being formed by the bonding of two or three orcinol or 3-orcinol-type\nphenolic units through ester, ether, and carbon\u2013carbon linkages (Shukla et al., 2010).\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the chemical constituents from the dry lichen body of Usnea diffracta Vain. Following the isolation procedure in this article, we isolated 30 compounds including 16 phenols from U. diffracta Vain, which specifically belonged to dibenzofurans, multi-substituted single benzene ring, depsides, organic acid, organic acid ester, fatty acids containing furan ring, furfural, amino acid, and nucleoside compound. After searching the SciFinder database, compounds 1\u20135 were identified as new compounds. Most of the compounds were multisubstituted single benzene ring, dibenzofurans, and depsides, all of which were recognized as the main secondary metabolites of Usnea.\nUsnea lichen has a long history of antimicrobial use as a folk medicine. Modern scientific research reveals that its crude extracts and monomer compounds have good progress in antimicrobial activities. Derivatives of depsides and dibenzofurans are the main\nFIGURE 3 3D binding mode of compound 2 with AChE.\nFIGURE 4 2D diagram of the ligand\u2013protein interaction for compound 2 with AChE.\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org09\nresources of its antimicrobial activities, especially the usnic acid is the most prominent which has a relatively wide antimicrobial spectrum. Several studies have confirmed that usnic acid can inhibit growth of different planctonic bacteria and fungi strains, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus mycoides, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli (Sultana and Afolayan, 2011; Helena et al., 2012; Rankovic et al., 2012). The antimicrobial activity of Usnea diffracta Vain ethyl acetate extracts against Actinomyces viscosus and Streptococcus mutans assays showed that ethyl acetate extracts were resistant to these strains (Qi et al., 2009). In this study, the disk diffusion method and the microdilution method were designed to screen the activities of the isolated compounds against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. An anti-C. albicans assay was not performed due to the insufficient amount of compounds 4\u20135. The results exhibited that compound 3 had certain inhibitory activities against S. aureus and E. coli but no anti-C. albicans activity at 64 \u03bcg/ml, compound 9 had certain an inhibitory effect on S. aureus and C. albicans with the MIC of 64 \u03bcg/ml, and compound 10 demonstrated the strongest inhibition against S. aureus and C. albicans among all compounds. Among them, compounds 9 and 10 belong to depsides. Although five dibenzofurans (1, 2, and 6\u20138) have no antibacterial effect, they can inhibit the growth of C. albicans with the MIC of 64 \u03bcg/ml. This further confirmed that derivatives of depsides and dibenzofurans were the main resources of its antimicrobial activities. The result that (+)-usnic acid (8) studied in this study showed no activity against S. aureus and E. coli does not mean that it is inconsistent with previous studies, but can only demonstrate that there is no bacteriostatic effect at this concentration. As this antimicrobial activity assay is only conducted in a certain concentration range for primary activity screening, and cannot be concluded that other compounds have no effect, the follow-up needs to be more detailed and in-depth study of the antimicrobial activities of these compounds.\nSince benzofuran has been reported to be a pharmacophore with cholinesterase inhibitory activity, and dibenzofurans, such as (+)-usnic acid, are similar to galantamine in structure, an anticholinesterase drug for AD. We designed experiments to observe the cholinesterase inhibitory activity of the isolated dibenzofurans 1, 2, and 6\u20138 and to study whether they can be potential cholinesterase inhibitors or drugs for the treatment of AD. The assay of AChE inhibitory activity was determined by the improved spectrophotometric Ellman\u2019s method (Zhu et al., 2019; Saenkham et al., 2020). Results demonstrated that the five compounds also exhibited AChE inhibition at the concentration of 0.3 \u03bcmol/ml with values of 1.01935 kcal/mol, 14.4513 kcal/mol, \u22121.95894 kcal/mol, 12.8461 kcal/mol, and -3.65539 kcal/mol, respectively. To follow up our results and study the binding affinity related to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, molecular docking simulations were performed. The 3D crystal structure of recombinant human AChE complexed with galantamine (code ID: 4EY6) was obtained from the protein data bank (PDB) with a resolution of 2.4 \u00c5 and docked with the 3D structure of five compounds (Cheung et al., 2012). Docking analysis exhibited that the investigated compounds had a high affinity for the acetylcholinesterase\u2019s active sites and higher \u2018\u2013CDOCKER Energy\u2019 than the original ligand molecule ranged from\n-3.65539 kcal/mol ((+)-usnic acid) to 14.4513 kcal/mol (Usneamine H) for the target enzyme. Usneamine H exhibited the highest AChE inhibition, which was consistent with the assay of AChE inhibitory activity. It formed four hydrogen bonding, amide\u2013Pi stacked, Pi\u2013catinon interaction, two Pi\u2013alkyl interactions to key residues at PAS, acyl pocket, anionic subsite, and oxyanion hole of AChE. These previous interactions assisted in the understanding of anti-AChE activity. However, considering the simplicity of our antiacetylcholinesterase activity experiments, whether the isolated compounds can become potential cholinesterase inhibitors still needs further research, such as cell assays and in vivo assays."

The 3D crystal structure of recombinant human AChE complexed with galantamine (code ID: 4EY6) was obtained from the protein data bank (PDB) with a resolution of 2.4 \u00c5 (Cheung et al., 2012). The 4EY6 protein was optimized through the Prepare Protein function of DS software, and the active pocked was defined by the original ligand molecule. Before molecular docking, the original ligand galantamine was redocked to the AChE active pocket. Default settings were kept for parameters. The structural differences before and after molecular docking were compared. The results showed that the RMSD value was 0.5002 \u00c5, indicating the rationality of the selected docking parameters and scoring function. Therefore, this parameter can be used for subsequent molecular docking research. The small molecules were introduced into DS software, and optimized by Prepare Ligands and Minimization. The CDOCKER module was used to simulate the molecular docking between small molecules and AChE. The docking results were analyzed using Discovery Studio Visualizer.

We isolated 30 compounds which belonged to dibenzofurans, multi-substituted benzenes, depsides, organic acids, fatty acids, amino acid, furfural, and nucleoside. It contains five new\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org12\ncompounds (1\u20135). The results of preliminary screening experiments on antibacterial and antifungal activities revealed that the new compound 3 had certain inhibitory activities against S. aureus and E. coli with IZ of 6.2 mm and 6.3 mm, depsides 9 and 10 had certain inhibitory effect on S. aureus and C. albicans. Compound 10 demonstrated the strongest inhibition against S. aureus and C. albicans with 6.6 mm and 32 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Five isolated dibenzofurans (1, 2, and 6\u20138) were evaluated for their biological properties toward specific target human AChE involved in AD. This study clearly demonstrated that they could effectively inhibit AChE at 0.3 \u03bcmol/ml. The most anti-AChE activity was demonstrated by the lichen secondary metabolite Usneamine H (2), which was identified as a new compound. Furthermore, the result of molecular docking was consistent with activity experimental data. This compound exhibited the strongest binding affinity and formed several tight bindings to key residues located in the peripheral active site, acyl pocket, anionic subsite, and the oxyanion hole of AChE. In addition, whether these compounds can be potential antimicrobial agents or drug candidate for the treatment of AD needs further study."
