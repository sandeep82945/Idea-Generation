1. **Investigate the effect of different polysaccharides on the properties of composite aerogels.** The current study only investigated the use of Konjac glucomannan (KGM) as the polysaccharide component of the composite aerogels. However, there are many other polysaccharides that could potentially be used, such as cellulose, starch, and chitosan. It would be interesting to investigate how the properties of the composite aerogels are affected by the choice of polysaccharide.


2. **Explore the use of different silica sources for the preparation of composite aerogels.** In this study, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was used as the silica source for the preparation of the composite aerogels. However, there are other silica sources that could potentially be used, such as sodium silicate and silica sol. It would be interesting to investigate how the properties of the composite aerogels are affected by the choice of silica source.


3. **Study the effect of different preparation methods on the properties of composite aerogels.** The current study only investigated the use of the solâ€“gel method for the preparation of the composite aerogels. However, there are other preparation methods that could potentially be used, such as the hydrothermal method and the electrospinning method. It would be interesting to investigate how the properties of the composite aerogels are affected by the choice of preparation method.


4. **Investigate the long-term stability of composite aerogels.** The current study only investigated the short-term stability of the composite aerogels. However, it is important to investigate the long-term stability of the composite aerogels to ensure that they can maintain their properties over time. This could be done by exposing the composite aerogels to different environmental conditions, such as high temperature, high humidity, and UV radiation.


5. **Explore the potential applications of composite aerogels.** The current study only briefly discussed the potential applications of composite aerogels. However, there are many potential applications for composite aerogels, such as thermal insulation, sound absorption, and oil-water separation. It would be interesting to investigate these potential applications in more detail.
