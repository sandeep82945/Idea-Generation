            "text": "Essential hypertension, as a well-established risk factor of cardiovascular disease, has become a global disease burden and public health concern (1). It has its roots in childhood (2). Own to the different measurement techniques, definitions, and population, the prevalence of hypertension in children and adolescents ranges from 0.3 to 12.6% (3\u20135) and is still increasing in developing countries. Blood pressure (BP) in childhood and adolescents could predict the risks of hypertension or cardiovascular disease in young adulthood (3, 4); therefore, identifying the risk factors for BP development from childhood into young adulthood is urgent.\nAccompanied by lifestyle changes (such as excessive internet and social media use) (5), family structure (6), and academic depression, the stress in children and adolescents has arisen and become a serious social problem. On the other hand, our previous study found that left-behind children in rural areas have a higher prevalence of hypertension (7), which may partially contribute to a difference in psychological factors between leftbehind children and children living with their core family (8). Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status (SES) (9), perinatal factors (10), anthropometric variables, nutrition (11), physical activity (12), obesity, and dyslipidemia as the risk factors for hypertension but not all the risk factors of hypertension have not been identified.\nIn personality psychology, introversion/extraversion is a dimension with the range between the two extremes, and within this range, there are people who are neither extrovert nor introvert (13). Eysenck suggests a concept that extroverts have fairly strong inhibitory processes but poor excitability. With robust nervous systems, extroverts have a high capacity for accepting stimulation. Hence, the brains of extroverts react to stimuli more slowly and weakly, leading to an inclination toward a strong sensory stimulation. In contrast, introverts have strong stimulatory processes. In terms of the cortex, introverts are inherently moremotivated, with brains that react faster andmore strongly to stimuli (14). It was reported that high extraversion participants showed a relatively lower cardiovascular response to moderate-intensity social stress (15), which plays a vital role in the development of hypertension (16\u201319). For example, Wright et al. reported a negative strong relationship between mindfulness and perceived stress in African-American college students (19). Similarly, another cross-sectional study also found that work-related stress was positively associated with cardiovascular risk among employees of a logistics company for safety in communications and flight (17). However, a few studies evaluated the impact of personality characteristics on the BP level (13, 20, 21). For example, Hozawa et al. found that the extraversion score was positively correlated with the systolic BP level (20), whereas the other two studies reported that extroversion personality was negatively associated with the BP level (13, 22). Because earlier studies mainly included a limited sample size in adults or special populations, the results were controversial (13, 20, 22, 23). In this study, we hypothesized that extrovertive personality is negatively associated with high BP in adolescents.\nOur study aims to examine the association between extrovertive personality and BP in adolescents who are living in urban and rural areas using cross-sectional data with a large sample size in China."

Participants who met all the following criteria were recruited: (1) participants aged between 6 and 9 years in 2014, (2) resided in the target region for more than 6 months, (3) did not have serious diseases (e.g., nephropathy, cardiovascular disease, or cancer), and (4) obtained consent from both the parent and children for participation. Finally, 5,246 children who were living in the selected communities were informed and included if they satisfied the inclusion criteria. Demographic information and physical examination data were collected at baseline. As an ongoing study, 4,162 participants were followed up in 2019. In addition to the physical examination, the Eysenck personality questionnaire (EPQ) was filled up in 2019. In this study, 3,407 participants with complete data are included in the analyses (Supplementary Figure 1) and a comparison of the difference between the included and excluded participants is presented in Supplementary Table 1.

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study that explored the relationship between extraversion personality and BP in adolescents. The results revealed that even adjusting for BMI and other covariates, a lower extraversion score was significantly associated with a higher BP in adolescents. Also, we for the first time reported that there was an interaction between regions and the extraversion score on a systolic BP, suggesting an urban-rural difference in the association of extraversion personality with high BP.\nEarlier studies on the association between personality traits and hypertension mainly included a limited sample size in adults or a special population. Arkwright et al. found that the prevalence of hypertension was three times more in introvertive male drinkers than in extrovertive male drinkers, but the effect disappeared in drinkers who also smoked (22). Namdar et al. also reported that introvertive healthy participants and hypertensive patients had a higher heart rate, a systolic and diastolic BP than the extrovertive ones, and after music intervention, the extrovertive ones obtained a greater reduction in SBP (13). Consistent with most previous studies, we found that a high extraversion score was positively associated with a lower BP in adolescents.\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 711474\n*Adjusted for age and sex. #Adjusted for age, sex, region, BMI, puberty, number of children, and father\u2019s education. SBP, systolic blood pressure; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; MAP, mean arterial pressure.\nBesides, our study for the first time revealed that the associations between extraversion personality and hypertension in adolescents were different in the urban and rural areas. As shown in our study, urban adolescents have a higher E score and a higher percentage of extroverts than their rural counterparts. One possible explanation, therefore, is that more left-behind children in rural areas have a lower extraversion score (29) and more psychological imbalance (30, 31), and psychological depression and anxiety (32, 33). Our results suggested that a comprehensive intervention should be implemented to promote psychological health in adolescents, especially for those who were living in rural areas.\nThe association between the extraversion score and high BP may be explained by different psychosocial stress and anxiety status between introvertive and extrovertive adolescents (34) as an introvert may increase stress (35) and develop greater anxiety (22). Earlier studies found that psychosocial stress and anxiety were associated with an increased risk of hypertension, in which the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may play crucial roles\n(26\u201328). Hozawa et al. found that introversion was associated with large differences between screening BP and home BP levels (21). This result was in line with the findings that introversion may represent a hyper-reactive personality, which leads to increased adrenaline concentrations (36) and then to essential hypertension (37). These studies, taken together, suggest that clinical treatment and the prevention of hypertension should consider personality traits.\nOne major strength of this study is that the association between personality traits and the BP level was examined in a large sample of adolescents. However, our study has one limitation that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, as a cross-sectional analysis, it is difficult to conclude a causal relationship between personality traits and hypertension. However, personality traits tend to be stable over time and consistent across situations (38). Another limitation was that not all risk factors for hypertension were available in this study (39, 40). Finally, our results may not be extrapolated to other countries due to varied national conditions.\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 5 March 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 711474\nIn conclusion, this study found that extraversion personality was independently associated with BP, after adjusting for BMI and other covariates. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore a relationship between extraversion personality traits and BP in a large sample of adolescents. Our study indicated that establishing comprehensive prevention measures (e.g., integrated hospital, community, school, and family) for the development of good personality traits and for providing support for left-behind children in rural areas may help to reduce or prevent hypertension, especially in children who were living in rural areas."
