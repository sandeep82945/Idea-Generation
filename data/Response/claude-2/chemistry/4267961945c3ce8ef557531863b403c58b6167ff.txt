 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Evaluate the efficacy of the CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR nanosheets on different types of wounds in animal models, such as burns, chronic wounds, etc. This would provide more evidence for its wound healing abilities. 

2. Conduct clinical trials in humans to determine the safety and efficacy of using the nanosheets on infected wounds in patients. This is necessary before the nanosheets could be approved for clinical use.

3. Investigate the long-term effects of the nanosheets on wound healing by looking at wound strength, collagen organization, scar formation, etc over extended time periods. This would provide more insight into their impact on wound remodeling. 

4. Develop new formulations or composites using the nanosheets as a base, but incorporating other antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory or wound healing agents. This could further optimize the properties and healing potential.

5. Elucidate the specific mechanisms of action of the nanosheets, such as signaling pathways involved in decreasing inflammation and increasing angiogenesis/collagen. This could lead to a greater understanding of how the nanosheets work.
