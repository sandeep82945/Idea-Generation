INTRODUCTION\nMeasuring the nonlinear viscoelastic response of complex fluids provides valuable insights into their constitutive behavior and underlying physics. One technique for studying the nonlinear response is large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS)1\u20134, which has been used to study a wide range of complex materials5\u201310. However, this technique can be hindered by noisy data, sample issues, and difficulty in relating the results to models. Weakly nonlinear methods, such as mediumamplitude oscillatory shear (MAOS)7,11\u201317 and medium amplitude superposition (MAPS)18,19, offer a sweet spot between small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and LAOS probing a regime with rich detail that is theoretically tractable.\nMAOS probes the gradual deviation from linearity in an oscillatory test. For example, applying a sinusoidal strain input represented as \u03b3(t) = \u03b30 sin\u03c9t in strain-controlled MAOS (MAOStrain) results in a time-periodic stress response that can be written as the expansion\n\u03c3(t) = \u03b30 ( G\u2032 sin\u03c9t +G\u2032\u2032 cos\u03c9t )\n+\u03b330 ([e1]sin\u03c9t +[v1]\u03c9 cos\u03c9t (1)\n\u2212 [e3]sin3\u03c9t +[v3]\u03c9 cos3\u03c9t)+O(\u03b350 ),\nwhere [e1], [v1], [e3], and [v3] are the frequency-dependent intrinsic Chebyshev nonlinearities defined by Ewoldt et al.12. Measuring these material functions provides more information about the material, quantifying changes in the nonlinear material response as a function of frequency (e.g., Fig. 1). This regime is also accessible to analytical model solutions15,20\u201324, which allows for material-property inference using information from both the linear and nonlinear material response25. MAOStrain, for instance, has been used to solve a 70-year-long debate in the literature about the origin of strain-stiffening in transient polymer networks26. Moreover, the MAOS material functions can be used to calculate the linearity limits of viscoelastic materials as a function of frequency by quantifying the absolute strength of the nonlinear deviation compared to the linear term. The linearity limits can be used to describe the regime boundary on a Pipkin map12,27\u201329 that separates the linear and nonlinear regimes30\u201332.\nThe MAOS approach to compute linearity limits in an oscillatory test is more rigorous than using the total deviation in the first harmonics. Since the nonlinear transition is gradual, linearity limits are typically defined as the forcing amplitude (stress, strain, or strain rate) at which the deviation from the linear plateau of a nonlinear material function exceeds a subjective threshold\n\u03b5 (e.g., |G \u2032 1(\u03b30)\u2212G\u2032|\nG\u2032 > \u03b5) 32. The MAOS material functions quantify this gradual transition12 (e.g.,\nG\u20321 = G \u2032+ [e1]\u03b320 + ... for small-enough amplitudes), and can be used to define a critical forcing amplitude for an arbitrary threshold (e.g., \u03b30,crit(\u03c9)\u221a\u03b5 = \u221a G\u2032(\u03c9) [e1](\u03c9) and \u03b3\u03070,crit = \u03c9\u03b30,crit), as shown in Fig. 1. The benefit of using the MAOS definition instead of the total deviation is that the total deviation may not be measurable for small threshold values (the corresponding forcing amplitude is too small), unlike the MAOS deviation that is quantifiable at any forcing amplitude if the material\nfunction is measured.\nNonlinear oscillatory measurements can be conducted in both strain-control and stress-control modes. While most of the LAOS measurements in the literature are strain-controlled (LAOStrain), many works used LAOStress (stress-controlled LAOS) to explore the nonlinear response of materials33,34. Stress-controlled results can be connected directly to many practical applications, such as gravity and pressure-driven flows. For certain materials, such as yield-stress fluids, stress-controlled oscillations allow for direct probing of the yielding transition and can add to the understanding derived from LAOStrain measurements. Moreover, Lauger and Stettin showed that LAOStrain and LAOStress probe a different material behavior, where significant differences in the Lissajous stress-strain curves were observed for Xantham gum35. Hence, a better understanding of stress-controlled nonlinear measurements will increase the accessibility of MAOS measurements.\nMAOStress has been theoretically anticipated since at least 2013 but has yet to be experimentally measured. A theoretical framework for stress-controlled MAOS (MAOStress) was developed by Ewoldt and Bharadwaj in 2013. For a sinusoidal stress input represented as \u03c3(t) = \u03c30 cos\u03c9t, the time-periodic strain response in the weakly nonlinear regime can be expanded as\n\u03b3(t) = \u03b3\u0304(\u03c9,\u03c30)+\u03c30 ( J\u2032 cos\u03c9t + J\u2032\u2032 sin\u03c9t ) +\u03c330 ( [c1]cos\u03c9t +\n[ f1] \u03c9 sin\u03c9t (2)\n+ [c3]cos3\u03c9t + [ f3] 3\u03c9\nsin3\u03c9t ) +O(\u03c350 ),\nwhere [c1], [ f1], [c3], and [ f3] are the frequency-dependent intrinsic Chebyshev nonlinear compliances and fluidities and \u03b3\u0304(\u03c9,\u03c30) is the baseline strain, as defined by Ewoldt et al.12. Similar to MAOStrain, a critical stress amplitude for nonlinearity \u03c30,crit can also be defined based on the measured MAOS material functions. While many MAOStrain measurements have been reported, no frequency-dependent MAOStress material functions have been previously reported.\nIn this work, we make the first-ever MAOStress measurement to test the weakly nonlinear response of PVA-Borax, including \u03b30,crit , \u03b3\u03070,crit , and \u03c30,crit . PVA-Borax has been well-studied using MAOStrain15,26, making it a model material to compare the two protocols. In the linear regime, stress- and strain-control protocols are interchangeable, but the stress-controlled perspective can still show a much simpler response (Fig. 1). Therefore, we want to examine how the material response signatures differ between these two methods. With the four MAOStrian and MAOstress material functions, one can identify the frequency-dependent limits of the linear viscoelastic ap-\nproximation (i.e., the strength of nonlinearity, which can be reinterpreted as a critical forcing strength where nonlinearity is \u2018significant\u2019 in terms of critical strain amplitude, or strain rate amplitude, or stress amplitude). We compare the frequency dependence of critical stress, strain, and strain rate for the emergence of nonlinearity. We show that stress is a more universal measure of nonlinearity strength, where the critical stress for nonlinearity varies minimally with frequency compared to the critical strain and strain rate.\nThis work is organized as follows: First, we introduce the material preparation protocol, the theoretical framework for MAOStress, and the experimental procedure that was followed. Section 3 presents the experimental measurement of the MAOStress material functions, where the frequency dependence of the weakly nonlinear response is thoroughly analyzed, in addition to analysis of the scaling of the nonlinear material functions with linear properties. Section 4 discusses the implications of the results on the frequency dependence of the critical stress, showing how Pipkin map limit lines can be affected by the choice of strain, strain rate, or stress as the measure of the forcing amplitude."

For sufficiently small amplitudes, the strain behaves linearly, where only the first harmonics, \u03b3 \u20321 and \u03b3 \u2032\u2032 1 , are required to describe the response, and these harmonics scale linearly with stress amplitude. In this limit of \u03c30 \u2192 0, referred to as small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS), the stress-independent linear elastic compliance J\u2032(\u03c9) = \u03b3 \u20321/\u03c30 and linear viscous compliance J \u2032\u2032(\u03c9) = \u03b3 \u2032\u20321 /\u03c30 (or fluidity \u03c6 \u2032 = J\u2032\u2032\u03c9) capture the frequency-dependence of the viscoelastic behavior. However, as the amplitude increases, the linearity with stress amplitude is broken by the emergence of higher harmonics and changes to the now amplitude-dependent first harmonics. One common assumption is that these\nco-sinusoidal input signal. The directly measurable quantities are torque M(t) and angular displacement \u03b8(t), which are proportional to stress (\u03c3(t) = 2\u03c0R3 M(t)) and strain (\u03b3(t) = 1 tan\u03b1 \u03b8(t)) respectively, where R and \u03b1 are the radius and angle of the cone, respectively.

All scale bars are 1 cm.\nharmonics can be expanded as a function of the stress amplitude \u03c30 using an integer power series, which applies to many materials. Nevertheless, some materials have shown non-integer power expansions17,38, which can be predicted from physical models such as Hertzian particle contact38. However, since previous experimental observations of PVA-Borax showed that an integer power series expansion works for that material, we expand the strain harmonics as integer powers. In the first deviation from linearity, only the first and third harmonics are present12, and the first and third\nstrain harmonics up to the first deviation are expanded as\n\u03b3 \u20321(\u03c30,\u03c9) = J \u2032\u03c30+ [c1]\u03c330 +O(\u03c3 5 0 ) (4a) \u03b3 \u2032\u20321 (\u03c30,\u03c9) = J \u2032\u2032\u03c30+\n[ f1] \u03c9 \u03c330 +O(\u03c3 5 0 ) (4b)\n\u03b3 \u20323(\u03c30,\u03c9) = [c3]\u03c3 3 0 +O(\u03c3 5 0 ) (4c) \u03b3 \u2032\u20323 (\u03c30,\u03c9) = [ f3] 3\u03c9 \u03c330 +O(\u03c3 5 0 ). (4d)\nThe first-harmonic intrinsic nonlinearities, [c1] and [ f1], quantify the degree to which changes in the first harmonics occur as the stress amplitude increases, causing intracycle changes in the material response. The sign of these material functions determines whether softening, stiffening, thinning, or thickening occurs as amplitude increases. The third harmonic intrinsic nonlinearities [c3] and [ f3] quantify the leading-order growth of the third harmonics of strain, causing increased distortion in the Lissajous curves."

            "text": "The stress-controlled oscillatory amplitude sweeps were conducted on the MCR 702 rotational rheometer in combined motor transducer mode. Care was taken to avoid experimental limitations39. We used a cone and plate geometry (d = 25 mm, \u03b1 = 4\u25e6) to ensure homogeneous stress and strain distribution within the sample. The temperature was controlled using a bottom Peltier plate at 25\u25e6C. After loading, the sample was coated with a thin layer of silicone oil (100 cst, Sigma Aldrich) at the edge of the gap to prevent water evaporation from the sample.\nThe material functions were extracted at every frequency by fitting the stress amplitude sweeps to Eqs. 4(a)-(d). The maximum stress amplitude tested has to be high enough to resolve the MAOS regime experimentally. However, it is preferred to avoid high stresses beyond the MAOS regime, which may cause irreversible changes to the material. This allows us to use the same sample to test multiple frequencies, simplifying the experimental protocol. Hence, several pretests were run to find the maximum stress amplitude we can reach at every frequency without causing irreversible change by comparing the linear viscoelastic frequency sweep before and after the sweep. This maximum amplitude and the minimum amplitude required to resolve the MAOS regime experimentally vary as a function of frequency. Therefore, a different stress range is set at each frequency. Moreover, the time required to complete the sweeps at the low frequency can\nexceed 24 hours, which puts the sample at risk of evaporation despite usingcone oil. For this reason, multiple loadings were used to test the entire frequency range.\nThe full frequency range (\u03c9 = [0.1\u2212 100]rad/s) was tested in three different loadings. We used \u03c30 = [1\u2212 300]Pa for \u03c9 = [0.1\u2212 1]rad/s, \u03c30 = [1\u2212 500]Pa for \u03c9 = [1.0\u2212 10.0]rad/s, and \u03c30 = [1\u22121000]Pa for \u03c9 = [10.0\u2212100.0]rad/s. Moreover, we used 50 points per decade of stress amplitude \u03c30 to get good resolution and to ensure that the steps in stress amplitude are small, such that the equilibration time from one amplitude to the other is low.\n(a) Amplitude Sweep (b) MAOS Deviation\nA custom Python code is used to process the stress and strain waveforms at every amplitude and frequency using a discrete Fourier transform to extract the strain harmonics {\u03b3 \u20321, \u03b3 \u2032\u20321 , \u03b3 \u20323, \u03b3 \u2032\u20323 }(\u03c30,\u03c9). The amplitude sweeps of the first-harmonic compliances (J\u20321 and J \u2032\u2032 1 ) can be used to identify the overall response of the material to the applied stress. An amplitude sweep for PVA-Borax is shown in Fig. 3 at \u03c9 = 5 rad/s. The decrease in compliances at increasing amplitudes highlights these networks\u2019 stiffening and thickening nature. While the linear compliances can be extracted from the first-harmonic compliances sweep, the intrinsic nonlinear coefficients are computed by isolating the nonlinear deviations as shown in Fig. 3b. The linear term can be subtracted from the elastic first-harmonic in Eq. 4a to isolate the weakly nonlinear term. At every frequency, the four weakly nonlinear deviations ({\u03b3 \u20321, \u03b3 \u2032\u20321 , \u03b3 \u20323, \u03b3 \u2032\u20323 }(\u03c30,\u03c9)) are fit to Eq. 4 to extract the MAOStress material\nfunctions J\u2032, J\u2032\u2032, [c1], [c3], [ f1], and [ f3]. The range of the fit was restricted to the experimental MAOS regime, which is lower bounded by the noise floor and upper bounded by the higher order terms (>\u03c330 ). Quantifying weak deviations is non-trivial, and we fully document the fits and the corresponding ranges in the Supplementary Information (SI).\nExperimental limits39 for the measured harmonics and compliances are useful to determine the accessible experimental window. From the primary observables of torque and rotational displacement, the window is set by the low torque limit Mmin\n\u03c3min = F\u03c3 Mmin, (5)\nthe high torque limit Mmax\n\u03c3max = F\u03c3 Mmax, (6)\nand the minimum displacement limit \u03b8min\n\u03b3min = F\u03b3\u03b8min (7)\nof the instrument. For a cone and plate geometry, F\u03c3 = 2\u03c0R3 and F\u03b3 = 1 tan\u03b1 , where R is the radius of the geometry and \u03b1 is the degree of the cone. The minimum measurable compliance can be inferred from the minimum strain as Jmin = \u03b3min/\u03c30. Figure 4 demonstrates how the experimental limits can be used to identify the theoretically accessible MAOStress experimental window of the instrument, e.g., based on the manufacturer specifications shown in Table I. The predicted lowdisplacement limit is only an order of magnitude higher than the measured limit of \u03b3min = 10\u22125. Moreover, the weakly nonlinear deviation characterized by the slope of 3 for the third harmonics in Fig. 4 can be significantly below the high-torque limit of the instrument. Despite that, the predicted low-torque limit is \u03c3min = 10\u22122 Pa, and the raw waveforms were found to be noisy below \u03c30 = 10 Pa. Therefore, the low-stress limit from Eq. 5 may not directly translate to the stress amplitude that can be measured. One possible explanation is that the torque is controlled in steps much smaller than the stress amplitude during an oscillatory test. For example, for the 512 points per cycle used, the minimum stress change between successive points can be found at the peak of the oscillatory wave. It can be estimated as \u2206\u03c3min\u03c30 = |cos(0)\u2212 cos(\u2206t\u03c9)|, where \u2206t\u03c9 = 2\u03c0/512 for a fixed time interval between points. Therefore, the minimum stress amplitude that can be controlled should be \u03c30,min = \u2206\u03c3min1\u2212cos(2\u03c0/512) \u2248 F\u03c3 Mmax 7\u221710\u22125 = 4 Pa for the geometry used in this work. This value provides a good starting point for experimental design, where the difference between the predicted (4 Pa) and actual (around 10 Pa from Fig. 4) low-stress limit is around a factor of 2 and can be due to ambient noise."

Similarly, 4wt% Borax (SigmaAldrich) solution was prepared by dissolving Borax in DI water. After the stock solutions cooled down to room temperature, the two solutions were mixed (27.5 PVA:12.5 Borax by solution mass) to prepare 2.75wt% PVA- 1.25wt% Borax solution. Air bubbles trapped during the mixing were\nremoved by centrifuging.\nProtorheology36, shown in Fig. 2(b), reveals that this PVA-Borax composition behaves as a viscoelastic liquid with a finite flow viscosity \u03b7 , observable elasticity, and relaxation time \u03c4 . Viscous flow is revealed by the time-lapse images, with observable flow on the order of tens of seconds and proceeding for 300 s in the images. A quantitative estimate of viscosity can be made by considering the radial evolution between t = 0 s and t = 180 s, assuming a viscous gravity current with steady viscous flow and negligible surface tension, as \u03b7 = 0.0195\u03c1g\u2206t h 3 2(3R 2 2+h 2 2) 3\nR82\u2212R81 where \u03c1\nis density, \u2206t is elapsed time, h2 is final height and R1, R2 are the initial and final radius, respectively. The t = 300 s frame was not considered because surface tension effects may compete with the viscous effects at that low height, and only viscosity and gravity were considered in the protorheology analysis. From Fig. 2(b), we have R1 = 1.6 cm, R2 = 2.5 cm and h2 = 1.1 cm and using \u03c1 = 103 kg/m3 and g = 9.8 N/kg, we obtained \u03b7 \u2248 2000 Pa.s at a characteristic stress of \u03c3grav \u2248 220 Pa and observation time of tobs = 180 s. This stress, as will be shown below, is within the weakly-nonlinear regime, which suffices in providing an approximation of the zero-frequency fluidity \u03c60 \u2248 1\u03b7 = 5\u00d7 10\u22124 (Pa.s)\u22121, which is within an order of magnitude of the measured \u03c60. The elastic behavior of PVA-Borax is indicated by the bounce test in Fig. 2(b) which shows elasticity at short times on the order of tens of milliseconds and a small loss factor tan\u03b4 = G\u2032\u2032/G\u2032 < 1 at these bouncing conditions, where tan\u03b4 can be quantitatively estimated from tan\u03b4 = 1\u03c0 ln( 1 f ), where f = hreb/hdrop is the recovered height fraction. From Fig. 2(b) we have f = 0.38 which gives tan\u03b4 \u2248 0.3 (corresponding to \u03c9 = \u03c0/\u2206t \u2248 157 rad/s where \u2206t \u2248 20 ms) at a characteristic stress of \u03c3 \u2248 210 Pa. The relaxation time \u03c4 is quantitatively bounded from these observations, being between the bouncing and time-lapse time scales, i.e., greater than 20 ms and less than 15 s. The protorheology observations are consistent with the linear viscoelastic frequency sweeps in Fig. 1 and provide compelling visual interpretations of key features therein. The images in Fig. 2(b) do not indicate the nature of the nonlinearity, which will be revealed by precision rheometry."

            "text": "Stress amplitude sweeps of PVA-Borax were conducted in the frequency range of [0.1-100 rad/s], and the resulting first and third strain harmonics are shown in Fig. 5 for frequencies of \u03c9 = [0.1,1,10,39.8] rad/s. The first-harmonic compliances exhibited a typical linear regime\nplateau, followed by a slight decrease due to the stress-stiffening nature of the material. The slight decrease in compliance led to orders of magnitude growth in the weakly nonlinear deviations of the first harmonics. These deviations were computed by subtracting the linear contributions, calculated as J\u2032\u03c30 and J\u2032\u2032\u03c30 for the elastic and viscous first harmonics. The fit lines in Fig. 5(c)-(f) demonstrate that the first and third-harmonic deviations grew closely to \u03c330 , consistent with the theory and measurements of the weakly nonlinear deviations in MAOStrain. The material functions associated with the fit lines were extracted as described in the methods section, and the fits for all the frequencies are shown in the SI (Figs.S2-S32). The observable deviations grow after a certain amplitude where the signal exceeds the noise floor. This noise was above the value predicted from the instrument limits using eq. 7. Furthermore, the noise floor increased with the experimental frequency. These observations can be explained by external factors, such as ambient noise, instrument state, and sample loading, that are difficult to predict a priori and are not accounted for by instrument calibration. Nonetheless, the minimum observable strain amplitude achieved was remarkably low (< 10\u22125) and was enough to extract the MAOStress material functions.\nThe frequency-dependent behavior of the extracted linear elastic compliance J\u2032 and viscous fluidity \u03c6 \u2032 = J\u2032\u2032\u03c9 is presented in Fig. 6. The LVE behavior of PVA-Borax is nearly Maxwellian but deviates from a single-mode Maxwell model due to its distribution of relaxation times, which was captured by a continuous Lognormal distribution (Appendix A). The mean relaxation time \u03c40 = 0.402s, dispersity index \u00d0= 2.54, and elastic compliance plateau J0 = 1G0 = 0.9\u00d710 \u22123Pa\u22121 were extracted from the moments of the distribution following the work of Martinetti et al40. The relaxation time \u03c40 was chosen as the mean relaxation time of the modulus-weighted spectrum Q(\u03c4) = H(\u03c4)\u03c4 (i.e., first-moment average in terms of Gi of a discrete spectrum) and can be related to the plateau modulus G0 and steady-state linear viscosity \u03b70 as \u03c40 = (\u03b70 \u2212\u03b7s)/G0 = \u03b70/G0, since the solvent viscosity \u03b7s is neglected here. The viscous compliance J\u2032\u2032 at the high frequencies (\u03c9 > 60 rad/s) is noisy, because it is the sub-dominant compliance component (tan\u03b4 < 0.1)41. This caused the fits to have an unsatisfactory adjusted coefficient of determination R2ad j (documented in the SI, Fig. S1) associated with the goodness of fit, and therefore the corresponding material functions are omitted from the results.\nThe frequency-dependent MAOStress material functions are reported in Fig. 7(a-d). The sign of the material functions is indicated by whether the symbol is filled (positive) or not (negative). The negative sign of the first-harmonic material functions [c1] and [ f1] shows that PVA-Borax stiffens and thickens with increasing stress across all the tested frequencies. The value of the\nnormalized material function can be used to compare to models or other material formulations to fit model parameters or establish benchmarks for desired nonlinearity in different applications. The material functions are normalized to represent the relative strength of the nonlinearity to the linear component, which will be further discussed below. The magnitude of [c1] decreases as a function of frequency, which shows that the stress-stiffening nonlinearity decreases in the elastic limit (high frequencies). On the other hand, the viscous nonlinearity is constant at the lower frequencies until \u03c9 = 10 rad/s, at which point a sharp decrease is observed, showing that the viscous thickening is weak in the elastic limit. Another reason behind this drop could be the difficulty of measurement because the viscous component is subdominant, as discussed above. The same material\u2019s MAOStrain results are unaffected at those frequencies (Fig. 7), which could be due to optimized control for oscillatory strain in commercial instruments compared to oscillatory stress.\nThird harmonics are associated with the distortion of Lissajous curves12,34,42. The sign of the third harmonics determines the concavity of the strain-stress Lissajous curves (fifth harmonics and higher also contribute, but these are negligible with the weakly nonlinear MAOStress). Third harmonics are best interpreted in the context of the first-harmonic deviations12. A negative value of [c3] and [ f3] means that within an oscillation cycle in the weakly nonlinear limit, the elastic and viscous compliance of the material decreases with stress and that the degree at which this decrease occurs increases with the stress amplitude (material is stiffer/thicker at higher stress). Combining this intracycle change indicated by [c3] and [ f3] with the observed intercycle stiffening and thickening at increasing amplitudes, as indicated by the signs of [c1] and [ f1], we can deduce that the stiffening occurs due to increased stress and not stress rates (following Fig. 7 in Ewoldt and Bharadwaj12). The positive sign of c3 for \u03c9 > 10rad/s suggests that the stiffening happens in that range primarily due to large stress rates and not stress itself. The ratio of the [c3] to [c1] and [ f3] to [ f1] is comparable to model predictions from the SSTNM model (\u2248 0.3) as derived in the SI. More about the mathematics behind the sign and magnitude interpretation of the intrinsic MAOS material functions can be found in prior work from our group12.\nas a function of frequency (both would be constant for a single-mode Maxwell model). The lognormal spectrum fit (Fig. A1) is used to compute the elastic plateau modulus G0N = 1060 Pa and average timescale \u03c40 = 0.402 s from which the elastic compliance J0 = 1G0N = 9.43\u00d7 10\u22124 (Pa)\u22121 and infinite time fluidity \u03c60 = 1G0N\u03c40 = 2.35\u00d710\u22123 (Pa.s)\u22121 are computed."

            "text": "The choice of normalization in Fig. 7 was based on the scaling observed in the Strain-Stiffening Transient Network Model (SSTNM)15,43 and the time-strain separable MAOS model44. Even though they are independent, the linear and nonlinear MAOStress material functions may all scale with a measure of the linear elastic compliance J0 or fluidity \u03c60. Similar behavior is observed in\nMAOStrain, where for many constitutive models, the linear and nonlinear material functions scale with G0 and \u03b70. These scalings emerge from the physics that underlies the behavior of the material. The SSTNM model was developed by Bharadwaj et al. in 2017 to model the strain-stiffening MAOS behavior of PVA-Borax, where none of the existing nonlinear viscoelastic models was able to capture the behavior of this material15.\nWe solved the SSTNM model numerically in stress control mode (computational details in Appendix B), which yields the normalization used in Fig. 7 using J0 and \u03c60. The results were corroborated by applying the Lennon et al.18 interrelations to the analytical solution15 of the MAOStrain material functions of the SSTNM model to convert to MAOStress functions. Moreover, applying the same relations to the time-strain separable MAOS models with a single-mode relaxation kernel yields the same scaling relationship (derived in Appendix B Eqs. 31). The MAOS time-strain separable (TSS) models are a generic category for which time-strain separability holds and where the damping function is expanded up to only the first deviation from linearity44. These findings suggest that the chosen normalization in Fig. 7 is suitable for comparing data from different materials as it provides a measure of nonlinearity independent from the linear compliance and fluidity for various models of nonlinear viscoelasticity.\nOther choices of MAOStress normalization are possible and can be derived by examining Eqn 4 but will have different physical interpretations as summarized in Table II. The unnormalized material functions (e.g., [c1]) quantify the rate at which the absolute nonlinear deviation (e.g., [c1]\u03c330 ) grows per unit of \u03c330 . However, when comparing different materials, the ratio of the deviation to the linear term at each frequency may be more relevant. Therefore, another choice to normalize is, e.g., [c1]J\u2032 (\u03c9) (similar normalization for the other material functions shown in Table II), which quantifies the rate at which the magnitude of the ratio [c1]\u03c3 3 0\nJ\u20321\u03c30 = [c1]\u03c320 J\u20321 grows per unit of \u03c320 . Ex-\namining the ratio [c1]\u03c3 2 0\nJ\u20321 provides an interpretation of the scaling inferred from the SSTNM and\nMAOS TSS models and helps rationalize why [c1] may scale with J30 . For a single-mode SSTNM model, J\u2032(\u03c9) = J0, and the stress amplitude \u03c30 is to first-order proportional to G0 = 1/J0 for any particular strain. Hence, the relative nonlinearity [c1]\u03c3 2 0\nJ\u2032 suggests and justifies the simpler model-\ninformed scaling [c1]/J30 , interpreted as a measure of relative nonlinearity at a strain of order one (\u03b3 \u2248 \u03c30J\u2032 = \u03c30J0 = 1 in this case). Similar reasoning for fluidity results in, e.g. [ f1]/(J20 \u03c60), as shown in Table II.\nThe model-informed [c1]/J30 normalization was reasoned from a single relaxation mode. However, PVA-Borax is better described by a distribution of relaxation times, in which case J0 can be\nreplaced with J\u2032 and \u03c60 with \u03c6 \u2032 (as in Table II (multi-mode)) to have an analogous interpretation at different frequencies. Comparing the frequency dependence of [c1] J30 and [c1]J\u20323 in Fig. A4 shows that the latter normalization varies less with frequency achieving a constant plateau for \u03c9 > 0.3 rad/s. This observation indicates that incorporating the frequency dependence of the linear material functions in the normalization helps reduce the complexity of the MAOStress description, which shows a near-constant relative nonlinearity as a function of frequency. This observation is remarkable and is associated with a weak frequency dependence of the critical stress amplitude, as we explore in detail below."

            "text": "The emergence of nonlinearities is gradual, and the choice of where the linear regime ends is arbitrary, e.g., depending on a specified threshold, say, \u03b5 . For example, Pearson and Rochehfort reported one of the earliest experimental measurements of a frequency-dependent critical strain \u03b3crit(\u03c9) in 198232, using the deviation of first-harmonic oscillatory measures. They defined the\nelastic critical strain at \u2223\u2223G\u20321\u2212G\u2032 G\u2032 \u2223\u2223= 5% and the viscous critical strain at \u2223\u2223G\u2032\u20321\u2212G\u2032\u2032G\u2032\u2032 \u2223\u2223= 5%, where G\u20321 = \u03c3 \u20321/\u03b30 and G \u2032\u2032 1 = \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 1 /\u03b30 (the stress harmonics \u03c3 \u2032 1 and \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 1 are defined in Appendix C below). The resulting values of \u03b3crit naturally depend on the choice of \u03b5 , and therefore the shape of \u03b3crit(\u03c9) may also depend on the chosen \u03b5 .\nMAOS enables a rigorous and threshold-independent study of the frequency dependence of the linearity limits \u03c3crit(\u03c9), \u03b3crit(\u03c9), and \u03b3\u0307crit(\u03c9). Ewoldt and Bharadwaj used MAOStrain material functions as a rigorous way to define linearity limit lines12 where the choice of \u03b5 is transparent. MAOS linearity limits directly compare the weakly nonlinear terms in the expansion to linear terms, providing a quantitative measure of nonlinear emergence and, as we show here, a critical forcing strength (strain, strain-rate, or stress) can be defined independent of the chosen threshold.\nThe functions \u03c3crit(\u03c9), \u03b3crit(\u03c9), and \u03b3\u0307crit(\u03c9) can be interpreted as regime boundaries in Pipkin maps. The Pipkin map was initially proposed in 1972 as a tool to map the behavior of complex fluids based on two key parameters: timescale (frequency) and forcing amplitude27. The timescale dependence in a Pipkin map is commonly captured by the Deborah number De \u2261 \u03c9\u03c4 or De \u2261 \u03c4/t, where \u03c4 is a characteristic relaxation time of the material, \u03c9 is the forcing frequency, and t is a characteristic time scale of the forcing. The Pipkin map has proven to be a valuable means of mapping rheometric conditions to application conditions, identifying regimes of applicability of constitutive models, and comparing the behavior of complex fluids45\u201347. Notably, Pipkin did not specify a particular measure of the forcing amplitude, leaving it open for interpretation. Commonly used measures include strain amplitude and the strain-rate amplitude (or Weissenberg number, sometimes written as Wi\u2261 \u03b3\u0307\u03c4)12,28,29,47. In the case of strain amplitude, \u03b3crit(De), the linearity limit line for a viscoelastic fluid exhibits a critical strain that diverges as the Deborah number (De) approaches zero according to the general theory of simple fluids by Coleman and Noll48,49. Conversely, when using strain rate or the Weissenberg number, Wicrit(De), the linearity limit line tends to approach a constant value in the viscous limit and diverges to infinity in the elastic limit.\nThe frequency-dependent linearity limit based on stress, \u03c3cirt(\u03c9), has not been previously predicted or measured, and MAOStress offers an effective means of experimental and numerical exploration. In this work, we use the MAOStress material functions to compute critical stresses for nonlinearity \u03c3crit based on the four independent material functions. Setting the ratio of the elastic and viscous weakly nonlinear deviations [c1]\u03c330 and [ f1] \u03c9 \u03c3 3 0 to the corresponding linear terms J\u2032\u03c30 and J\u2032\u2032\u03c30 to an as-yet-unspecified threshold \u03b5 , we can define critical stresses based on the\nfirst-harmonic nonlinearities as:\n[c1]\u03c33crit J\u2032\u03c3crit = \u03b5 \u21d2 \u03c3crit,[c1](\u03c9)\u221a \u03b5 =\n\u221a J\u2032\n[c1] (8a)\n[ f1]\u03c33crit J\u2032\u2032\u03c9\u03c3crit = \u03b5 \u21d2 \u03c3crit,[ f1](\u03c9)\u221a \u03b5 =\n\u221a \u03c6 \u2032\n[ f1] . (8b)\nSimilarly, for the third harmonics, we set the ratio of the elastic and viscous weakly nonlinear deviations [c3]\u03c330 and [ f3] 3\u03c9 \u03c3 3 0 to the corresponding linear terms J \u2032\u03c30 and J\u2032\u2032\u03c30 to the threshold \u03b5 to obtain:\n[c3]\u03c33crit J\u2032\u03c3crit = \u03b5 \u21d2 \u03c3crit,[c3](\u03c9)\u221a\u03b5 = \u221a J\u2032 [c3]\n(9a)\n[ f3]\u03c33crit 3J\u2032\u2032\u03c9\u03c3crit = \u03b5 \u21d2 \u03c3crit,[ f3](\u03c9)\u221a\u03b5 = \u221a 3\u03c6 \u2032 [ f3] . (9b)\nNote that we keep \u03b5 on the left-hand side of Eqs. 8\u20139, thereby creating new definitions for critical forcing amplitudes that incorporate arbitrary threshold \u03b5 . That is, the threshold \u03b5 can be unspecified (since it can be arbitrarily large or small, based on the intention of application), allowing for comparison of critical forcing strengths independent of the choice of \u03b5 . For example, choosing \u03b5 = 10% rather than \u03b5 = 0.1% will increase the critical stress by 10. However, reporting the ratio \u03c3crit/ \u221a \u03b5 will allow for comparison between different works, where a specific critical value can be calculated for any threshold desired. This applies to other measures of nonlinearity, such as strain and strain rate.\nTherefore, we recommend, in general, that future works consider reporting the threshold-\nnormalized critical forcing amplitudes, [\u03c3crit ], [\u03b3crit ], and [\u03b3\u0307crit ] as\n[\u03c3crit ]\u2261 \u03c3crit\u221a\n\u03b5 , [\u03b3crit ]\u2261 \u03b3crit\u221a \u03b5 , [\u03b3\u0307crit ]\u2261 \u03b3\u0307crit\u221a \u03b5 . (10)\nThis normalization allows for better comparison of critical forcing amplitudes, but we acknowledge that it strictly applies for asymptotic deviation from the linear limit theory where higher order terms can be neglected.\nFigure 8 shows how each critical stress depends on Deborah number by applying Eqs.8\u20139 to the data in Fig. 7. The resulting lines represent potential boundaries of the linear regime on a Pipkin map constructed using stress to measure the nonlinearity strength. Stress values below the line are within the linear regime to within a deviation threshold \u03b5 of each MAOStress metric. The results show that the MAOStress first-harmonic has the lowest critical stress and is, therefore, the\nfirst to reach a nonlinearity threshold, also observed in the amplitude sweeps shown in Fig. 5. Moreover, the first harmonics have a weak frequency dependence compared to the more complex dependence exhibited by strain and strain rate first harmonics, as shown in Appendix C (Fig. A6). A peak occurs at 10 rad/s for the third harmonics, concurrent with the sign change in [c3] and drop in [ f3]. The results in Fig. 8 reveal that the MAOStress behavior of this PVA-Borax formulation was accessible because the stress required to measure the nonlinear material functions was in an accessible range of stress within the limits of the instrument (and that did not cause irreversible changes to the material)."

To facilitate this comparison, we derived a single critical stress instead of four values from the different material functions.

The drawback of this approach is that the critical stress linearity limit line will be noisy as the criteria shift between different metrics. To resolve this issue, we define a single critical stress based on the first harmonics by finding the stress at which the magnitude of the total first-harmonic deviation exceeds a threshold in comparison to the magnitude of the linear first-harmonic complex compliance\u221a ([c1]\u03c33crit)2 +( [ f1] \u03c9 \u03c3 3 crit)\n2\u221a (J\u2032\u03c3crit)2 +(J\u2032\u2032\u03c3crit)2 = \u03b5 \u21d2 \u03c3crit,1(\u03c9)\u221a \u03b5 = \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a |J\u2217|\u221a ([c1])2 + ( [ f1] \u03c9\n)2 .

(13)\nSimilarly, the critical strain for nonlinearity can be computed from the MAOStrain material functions, measured on the ARES-G2 rheometer as described in Appendix C. The critical strain \u03b3crit is the minimum of \u03b3crit,1 and \u03b3crit,3\n\u03b3crit = min(\u03b3crit,1,\u03b3crit,3), (14)\nwhich are defined as\u221a ([e1]\u03b33crit)2 +([\u03c9v1]\u03b3 3 crit)\n2\u221a (G\u2032\u03c3crit)2 +(G\u2032\u2032\u03c3crit)2 = \u03b5 \u21d2 \u03b3crit,1(\u03c9)\u221a \u03b5 =\n\u221a |G\u2217|\u221a\n([e1])2 +(\u03c9[v1])2 , (15)\nand \u221a ([e3]\u03b33crit)2 +([\u03c9v3]\u03b3 3 crit)\n2\u221a (G\u2032\u03c3crit)2 +(G\u2032\u2032\u03c3crit)2 = \u03b5 \u21d2 \u03b3crit,3(\u03c9)\u221a \u03b5 =\n\u221a |G\u2217|\u221a\n([e3])2 +(\u03c9[v3])2 .

Remarkably, the dimensionless critical stress approaches equivalence with the critical strain in the elastic limit (high Deborah number) and approaches the dimensionless critical strain rate in the viscous limit (low Deborah number).\nWe hypothesize that this result can be justified by first considering that the stress is dominated by the viscous contribution at low frequencies and elastic effects at high frequencies for a viscoelastic liquid. Specifically for PVA-Borax, the emergence of nonlinearity is directly related to the local stretch (deformation) of the polymer chains15,43, rather than other deviations from equilibrium such as polymer orientation or network junction breakage. Therefore, we can hypothesize that nonlinearity arises due to the micromechanical strain of elastic (polymeric) units.\nIn the elastic limit De \u2192 \u221e, the deformation timescales are shorter than the timescale of transient network bond dissociation, and the applied strain is fully translated into the micromechanical stretch of the polymer strands, which will exceed the linearity threshold at a critical characteristic forcing strain \u03b3crit , consistent with the physical picture. Quantitatively, this critical strain maps directly to a critical elastic stress \u03c3crit = G0\u03b3crit , equal to the critical total stress if purely viscous solvent contributions are neglected and if strain nonlinearities are neglected. In the absence of purely viscous stresses, this predicts \u03b3crit = \u03c3crit/G0 in the limit De \u2192 \u221e, a close correspondence that we observe in Fig. 9. We specifically observe a slightly larger dimensionless critical stress, consistent with a purely viscous solvent being present that adds to the total observed stress. Another explanation of the slight discrepancy is that the approximation \u03c3crit = G0\u03b3crit will underpredict the critical stress since, for a stiffening material like PVA-Borax, the effective modulus will be higher than the linear plateau modulus G0. Therefore, the dimensionless critical stress calculated as \u03c3crit/G0 will be higher than the critical strain \u03b3crit .\nIn the viscous limit De \u2192 0, the stress is independent of the total accumulated strain and instead is proportional to the strain rate. We expect a critical strain rate \u03b3\u0307crit associated with a critical stress as \u03c3crit \u2248 \u03b70\u03b3\u0307crit (neglecting solvent viscosity and nonlinearity of the stress-strain rate relationship). The nonlinearity for PVA-Borax is caused by micromechanical polymer strain, which in this limit is proportional to the applied strain rate. The critical dimensionless stress is then\n\u03c3crit/G0 = (\u03b70/G0)\u03b3\u0307crit , or in terms of dimensionless critical strain rate, \u03c3crit/G0 = \u03c40\u03b3\u0307crit This rationalizes the close correspondence of dimensionless critical stress and strain rate in the limit De \u2192 0, as we observe in Fig. 9. The slightly higher normalized critical stress, however, can also be explained by the neglected solvent viscosity and thickening nonlinearity of PVA-Borax in the prediction \u03c3crit \u2248 \u03b70\u03b3\u0307crit . The critical stress values at De \u226a 1 and De \u226b 1 are similar but different, and some insight is provided by considering the critical micromechanical strain (polymer stretch) for PVA-Borax in steady flow. The accumulated polymer strain under steady flow is \u221d \u03b3\u0307\u03c4 (equivalent to a Weissenberg number50), where \u03c4 is a characteristic relaxation time of the elastic components that determines the accumulated micromechanical strain for a given strain rate \u03b3\u0307 . Assuming that the critical accumulated micromechanical strain is proportional to \u03b3crit observed in the limit De \u226b 1, this predicts \u03b3\u0307crit \u2248 \u03b3crit/\u03c4 . Then in the De \u226a 1 limit, the critical stress is \u03c3crit = \u03b70 \u02d9\u03b3crit , or \u03c3crit/G0 = (\u03c40/\u03c4)\u03b3crit . Therefore, the ratio \u03c40/\u03c4 may rationalize the difference in critical stress in the limit De \u226a 1 compared to De \u226b 1. We observe a lower critical stress for De \u226a 1, suggesting that the ratio \u03c40/\u03c4 < 1. If the characteristic timescale \u03c4 that determines the accumulated critical polymer stretch in steady flow is close to the average relaxation time \u03c40, then the critical stress in the elastic limit and viscous limit will be similar. However, if these two timescales differ (e.g. for polydisperse systems), then the critical stress may be different. For example, Nichetti and ManasZloczower derived that for a polymer melt with a lognormal distribution of molecular weights, where the critical stress is constant for all molecular weights, the\nThe potential universality of critical stress might extend to a broad range of viscoelastic liquids. It is conceivable that any given viscoelastic liquid could exhibit a finite critical strain, \u03b3crit , in the elastic limit (De \u2192 \u221e) and a finite critical strain rate, \u03b3\u0307crit , in the viscous limit (De \u2192 \u221e). This would imply that the critical stress (\u03c3crit = G0\u03b3crit for De \u226b 1 and \u03c3crit = \u03b70\u03b3\u0307crit for De \u226a 1) approach plateaus in these limits. However, the critical strain and strain rate are expected to exhibit diverging behavior in the limit of De \u226a 1 and De \u226b 1, respectively. Therefore, while our experimental observations suggest the universality of critical stress will hold more generally, further research is needed to confirm and generalize this finding to other materials. Supporting evidence already exists. For example, our observations align with an earlier study by Hatzikiriakos and Dealy51, which reported a frequency-independent critical stress for instability/wall slip in a sliding plate rheometer, another type of nonlinearity under oscillatory shear deformations.\nThe universality of critical stress may allow for faster characterization of material properties us-\ning the frequency-sweep MAOS method14. This technique eliminates the need for a full amplitude sweep at every frequency and instead relies on the ability to predict at which amplitude the MAOS material functions can be measured. Based on that prediction, a single amplitude measurement is done at every frequency. Since the critical stress varies slightly as a function of De compared to critical strain, applying the frequency-sweep MAOS technique in MAOStress should be simpler. This will result in a high-throughput characterization while minimizing the impact of chemical and physical changes in the loaded material. A similar phenomenon is utilized in medium amplitude superposition (MAPS) measurements, where the optimal window is frequency-independent in stress-controlled mode52. Additionally, this work shows that the change in the critical stress amplitude required to measure MAOStress nonlinearities is much smaller than MAOStrain measurements, making the MAOStress technique potentially more accessible than MAOStrain."

            "text": "The MAOStress response of PVA-Borax was thoroughly studied, showing that stress-controlled measurements can offer another route for testing the weakly nonlinear regime and answer fundamental questions regarding the origins of nonlinearity in viscoelastic materials. The MAOStress results confirmed the stiffening nature of PVA-Borax and showed that stress is a more universal measure of nonlinearity strength across a wide range of De, consistent with the microstructure of PVA-Borax. Moreover, the measured linearity limits can be interpreted as Pipkin map regime boundaries, offering experimental testing and validation of theoretical predictions. The SSTNM model was used to derive a viable normalization of the nonlinear MAOStress material functions that account for their scaling with the linear material properties. The frequency dependence of the normalized material functions revealed a simplicity in the features of MAOStress material functions compared to MAOStrain. This simplicity could be harnessed in future works that compare MAOStress measurements with model predictions for physical inference.\nThe intrinsic nonlinearities were used to derive a threshold-independent critical forcing amplitude and to show that stress is a more universal measure of nonlinearity strength as its frequency variability at the emergence of nonlinearity is much smaller than MAOStrain. This fundamental result should be considered when studying deformation-induced physical phenomena at different timescales or frequencies. Moreover, this result has significant implications for small amplitude oscillatory shear measurements (SAOS). A common practice for choosing a strain or stress amplitude for a linear SAOS measurement is to do an amplitude sweep at different frequencies and choose a strain or stress in different frequency ranges with a good signal-to-noise ratio without being in the nonlinear regime. With the insights from section IV, it may suffice to only do an amplitude sweep at each end of the frequency range to find a suitable stress amplitude for the entire frequency range of a measurement.\nThe findings of this work motivate future exploration of the MAOStress response of other materials. For example, comparing the MAOStress material functions of multiple PVA-Borax formulations could be very insightful in understanding the effect of microstructural changes on the material properties. Moreover, testing different viscoelastic materials, such as melts, colloids, and multi-component systems, will also highlight the effect of the microstructure on the MAOStress response."

Both the units and the scale motivate the search for a normalization that accounts for the scaling of these nonlinear material functions with the linear material functions and that provides a measure of the relative nonlinearity that allows for comparison with other materials of interest. Hence, we solved the SSTNM model in the MAOStress regime to explore this scaling.\nFirst, the SSTNM model is solved numerically, which reveals that the material functions scale according to the normalization shown in Figure 7. Second, we use the Lennon et al. interrelations18 to find the exact analytical solution of MAOStress material functions for the SSTNM model. The results show that the numerical and analytical solutions match and validate each other. Finally, we use the validated Lennon et al. interrelations to find the analytical solution of the general MAOS TSS model, which exhibited the same scaling as the SSTNM model.\nNumerical Solution of SSTNM model in MAOStress\nTo solve the SSTNM model numerically, we start with the differential equations given by Bharadwaj et al.15(their sections IV.A and IV.B.). The stress tensor \u03c3 is written in terms of a stretch vector Q and a microstructural conformation tensor A = <QQ> Q2eq,i as\n\u03c3 = H(Q)Q2eq,iA, (24)\nwhere Qeq,i is the ith component of the equilibrium end-to-end vector between neighbouring network junctions at equilibrium, and Q = Qeq,itr(A) is the average stretch magnitude. The time evolution of A is given by \u2207 A=\u2212 1\u03c40 (A\u2212 I), (25) where \u03c40 is the relaxation timescale, I is the identity tensor, and \u2207 A is the upper convected time derivative. This derivative is frame-indifferent and is given by\n\u2207 A\u2261 DADt \u2212 (\u2207v) T \u00b7A\u2212A \u00b7 (\u2207v), (26)\nwhere v is the local velocity vector and DADt is the material derivative given by DA Dt = \u2202A \u2202 t +(v \u00b7\u2207)A. For simple shear flow and assuming Aii(t = 0) = 1, Eq. 25 simplifies to two differential equations\ndA11 dt \u22122\u03b3\u0307A21 =\u2212 1 \u03c40 (A11 \u22121), (27a)\ndA21 dt \u22122\u03b3\u0307 =\u2212 1 \u03c40 (A21).

Replacing H and \u03c321 in Eq. 24, the coupled differential equations in Eq. 27 can be rearranged into a single differential equation\ndA11 dt =\u2212 1 \u03c40\n[ (A11 \u22121)+2 \u03c3 2 0\nH20 (1\u2212\u03b1(A11 +2))2[\u03c40\u03c9 sin(\u03c9t +\u03c6)cos(\u03c9t +\u03c6)\u2212 cos2(\u03c9t +\u03c6)]\n1+ 2\u03c3 2 0\nH20 \u03b1(1\u2212\u03b1trA)cos2(\u03c9t +\u03c6)\n] .\n(28)\nMoreover, the equations can also be rearranged to compute the strain rate \u03b3\u0307(t) as\n\u03b3\u0307 = \u03c30\n\u03c40H0 (\u03b1(A11 +2)\u22121)[\u03c40\u03c9 sin(\u03c9t +\u03c6)\u2212 cos(\u03c9t +\u03c6)]\u2212 \u03c30 H0 \u03b1 cos(\u03c9t +\u03c6) dA11 dt . (29)\nAfter solving for the time-dependence of A11 using Eq. 28, \u03b3\u0307(t) can be directly computed from Eq. 29, and \u03b3(t) was computed by integrating \u03b3\u0307(t) . The equilibrium modulus G0 can be calculated as G0 = H0 1\u22123\u03b1 . The numerical solution at every stress amplitude and frequency is obtained by solving Eq. 29 with an initial condition A11(t = 0) = 1 and with \u03c321 = \u03c30 cos(\u03c9t + \u03c02 ) from t = 0 to t = 152\u03c0\u03c9 (15 cycles). We choose \u03c6 = \u03c0 2 to start with an equilibrium state A11(t = 0) = 1. The first 12 cycles are not processed and are used to reach steady-alternance of the system. The last three cycles are processed with a Discrete Fourier Transform to obtain the strain harmonics. Next, similar to the experimental protocol above, a stress amplitude sweep is run at every frequency of interest to extract the MAOStress material functions by fitting the harmonics to the expansion in Eq. 4.\nTo test the scaling of the MAOStress material functions with J0, \u03c40, a scatter plot was generated by simulating the model with various parameters as shown in Figure A2. The nonlinear coefficient H was defined by Bharadwaj et al. as H = \u2202 lnH(Q)\u2202 lnQ |Q=Qeq = 6\u03b11\u22123\u03b1 . The MAOStrain material functions scale linearly with H , and the same was observed for the MAOStress material functions here. Through empirical observation, the material functions [c1], [ f1], [c3], and [ f3] were observed to scale with J30 , J 2 0 \u03c60, J 3 0 , and J 2 0 \u03c60, respectively.\nAnalytical Solution Using Lennon et al. Interrelations\nThe analytical solutions from the Lennon et al. interrelations corroborate the numerical solution of the SSTNM model. The interrelations (see their Eqs.B3-4) convert MAOStrain material functions to MAOStress material functions, assuming a Volterra series expansion for the stress as a function of strain.

(31d)\nThe MAOS TSS and the SSTNM models reveal the same scaling with linear material properties.\nOther choices of normalization\nIn the results section, we discussed the reasoning for why these models are predicting this scaling. Moreover, we attempted to generalize the normalization for materials and models that do not have a single relaxation mode by replacing J0 and \u03c60 by J\u2032 and \u03c6 \u2032, respectively. Figure A4 shows that this normalization does reduce the complexity of the MAOStress material function representation for the PVA-Borax sample."

We used \u03b30 = [0.1,120]% for \u03c9 = [0.1\u2212 1]rad/s, and \u03b30 = [0.1,100]% for \u03c9 = [1.0\u2212 100.0]rad/s. Moreover, we used 50 points per decade of \u03b30 to get good resolution and to ensure that the steps in strain amplitude are small, such that the equilibration time from one amplitude to the other is low.

Moreover, Figure A5 compares the linear material functions from MAOStrain and MAOStress, showing that the two procedures resulted in identical linear material functions. The MAOStress moduli were obtained by converting the measured compliances, using the interchangeability relationships Eqs.21 and 22. The MAOStrain material functions were used to compute the critical strain for the onset of nonlinearity using Eqs. 15 and 16. Moreover, Figure A6 compares the critical stress and strain based on the first and third harmonics."
