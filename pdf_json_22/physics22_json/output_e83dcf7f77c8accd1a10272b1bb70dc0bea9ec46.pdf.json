In this letter, we propose a tensor network based algorithm to numerically extract lattice operator approximation of the emergent conserved currents from the ground state of any quantum spin chains, without the necessity to have prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Our results for the spin-1/2 J-Q Heisenberg chain and a onedimensional version of the deconfined quantum critical points (DQCP) demonstrate the power of our method to obtain the emergent lattice Kac-Moody generators. It can also be viewed as a way to find the local integrals of motion of an integrable model and the local parent Hamiltonian of a critical gapless ground state.\nIntroduction.\u2014Low-energy physics can show different symmetries from the Hamiltonian. In the thermodynamic limit, the continuous symmetry of a Hamiltonian can be spontaneously broken in its ground state, or new symmetries that the Hamiltonian does not possess can emerge in its low-energy spectrum. The latter phenomenon of emergent symmetries is prevalent at the critical point of many quantum and classical phase transitions, provided the symmetry breaking terms in the Hamiltonian are irrelevant under the renormalization group (RG) flow. The most prominent example might be the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) [1, 2], a direct continuous phase transition between two distinct spontaneous symmetry broken phases without finetuning, beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. The emergent symmetry which reconciles the incompatible order parameters thus becomes the smoking gun to determine whether such a phase transition is really a DQCP. Another example is the extended symmetry in the low-energy eigenstates of a one-dimensional (1D) critical Hamiltonian with an internal semi-simple Lie group symmetry, when its low-energy physics is described by a conformal field theory (CFT) [3, 4]. In this case, the microscopic symmetry and the emergent symmetries can be recombined to form two independent symmetries acting respectively on the left- and right-moving fields, with the corresponding conserved charges being the zero modes of the Kac-Moody algebra [5, 6].\nPlenty of numerical efforts [7\u201310] have been devoted to confirming the existence of emergent symmetries. In the case of DQCP, the identity between the scaling dimensions of the critical fluctuations related by emergent symmetries would be an indication [8, 11]. Other approaches include order parameter histograms [11, 12] and levelcrossing analysis [13]. A more direct probe of emergent symmetries is to check if the scaling dimensions of the effective lattice operators for the conserved currents in the field theory are equal to the space dimension [8, 9]. However, identification of lattice operators to the currents in the continuum limit requires involved field theory and symmetry analysis [8, 14]. Moreover, the identification is\nusually only approximate and also not unique. Instead, tensor networks [15\u201318] provide us with much more information than simply a measurement outcome of the correlation function for given operators. In fact, rather than derive from field theory analysis, we are able to read out the lattice operator for the emergent conserved currents from a tensor network state in a straightforward way. Upon feeding a variationally optimized tensor network ground state [19, 20], our algorithm returns the optimal lattice approximation of the conserved current operators truncated to a given interaction range N , which systematically approximates the exact symmetry generators as N increases. Algorithm.\u2014If a state |\u03c8\u27e9 is symmetric under a global continuous symmetry transformation U = ei\u03f5O, then U |\u03c8\u27e9 = ei\u03f5\u03d5|\u03c8\u27e9. After absorbing the phase factor into the definition of O, i.e. O \u2192 O \u2212 \u03d5I, we have ei\u03f5O|\u03c8\u27e9 = |\u03c8\u27e9, and its linearization gives\nO|\u03c8\u27e9 = 0, (1)\nor \u27e8\u03c8|O\u2020O|\u03c8\u27e9 = 0. For an internal symmetry with local generators, O = \u2211 n e\nipnGn,...,n+N\u22121, where p is the momentum and Gn,...,n+N\u22121 is a N -site operator starting at the nth site. Given a state |\u03c8\u27e9 and a momentum p, if we aim to obtain an exact or approximate conserved quantity of this form which the state has, we can consider the optimization problem\nmin G f(G,G\u2020) = min G \u27e8\u03c8|O\u2020O|\u03c8\u27e9 V Tr[G\u2020G]\n(2)\nwith the normalization constraint \u2225G\u22252 = Tr[G\u2020G] = 1, where V is the system size. Note that this cost function has a physical interpretation of the static structure factor of G at momentum p. The unitarity of U requires O, and thus G, to be Hermitian. In that case, the optimum of f is reached when \u2202f\u2202G = 0, i.e.\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u2202O \u2020\n\u2202G O|\u03c8\u27e9+ \u27e8\u03c8|O\u2020 \u2202O \u2202G |\u03c8\u27e9 = 2 \u27e8\u03c8|O \u2020O|\u03c8\u27e9 Tr[G2] G, (3)\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n17 53\n9v 4\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 2\n6 N\nov 2\n02 3\n2 which, after vectorizing G 7\u2192 g, becomes an eigenvalue problem\n(F + FT ) \u00b7 g = 2\u03bbming, (4)\nwhere the eigenvalues are guaranteed to be non-negative real numbers due to the positive semi-definite quadratic form of the cost function f , and it can be proved [21] that the eigenvectors G are guaranteed to be Hermitian up to an arbitrary overall phase. For an eigenvector G, the associated eigenvalue \u03bb naturally measures how accurate\nthe corresponding symmetry is. For an infinite matrix product state (MPS) |\u03c8\u27e9, this eigenvalue problem can be solved by adapting MPS techniques used in other contexts; readers not interested in these details can skip this paragraph. Take |\u03c8\u27e9 as an infinite uniform MPS with one-site unit cell parameterized by tensors AL, AR, and AC in the mixed gauge. The application of F to g, and similarly FT \u00b7g, can be implemented by observing that [22] it is the same as calculating the static structure factor of G except that a hole is dug in all the terms, i.e.\nF \u00b7 g = \u27e8\u03c8|\u2202O \u2020\n\u2202G O|\u03c8\u27e9\n= \u27e8\u03c8|  1V \u2211 m e\u2212ipm . . .\nm m+N \u2212 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . . .  \u2211\nn\neipn . . .

We can then use an iterative eigensolver [23] to obtain the lowest several solutions [24].\nIn principle, the algorithm works for any MPS [25]. Particularly, we are interested in applying it to the variational uniform MPS (VUMPS) [19] approximation of the gapless ground state of 1D critical Hamiltonians. Since an MPS with finite bond dimension is always gapped [20], it can never exactly represent a critical ground state of infinite correlation length and thus can never exactly capture the symmetry of a critical lattice Hamiltonian or of its low-energy effective field theory in the infrared limit. However, we may use the principle of entanglement scaling [26\u201328] and treat the finite bond dimension \u03c7 as a\nrelevant perturbation, which enables us to identify the exact or emergent symmetries exclusively from the MPS through an extrapolation in the correlation length \u03be, as shown by the benchmark results below. Benchmarks for exact symmetries.\u2014As a warming up, we first consider a critical model whose ground state has an exact U(1) symmetry [29]\u2014the spin-1/2 isotropic quantum XY chain\nH = \u2212 \u2211 n (XnXn+1 + YnYn+1) , (6)\nwhere Xn, Yn, and Zn are the Pauli matrices at site n. The U(1) symmetry is generated by O = \u2211 n Zn that\nsatisfies [H, \u2211\nn Zn]=0. The model is integrable and thus has infinitely many local conserved quantities in the thermodynamic limit [30\u201333]. The critical low-energy physics is described [34] by the U(1)4 CFT of free bosons with central charge c = 1. Applying our algorithm to MPS of various bond dimensions yields the local conserved quantities up to N = 3. The full spectrum (after removing the trivial solutions) of the eigenvalue problem in Eq. (4) are shown in Fig. 1 and\n3 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 -10 10 -5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 -10 10 -5 10 0\n10 1 10 2 10 3 10 -10\n10 -5\n10 0\n10 1 10 2 10 3 10 -10\n10 -5\n10 0\n10 1 10 2 10 3 10 -10\n10 -5\n10 0\n10 1 10 2 10 3 10 -10\n10 -5\n10 0\nN = 1, p = 0 N = 1, p = \u03c0\nN = 2, p = 0 N = 2, p = \u03c0\nN = 3, p = 0 N = 3, p = \u03c0\n(a)\n(c)\n(e)\n(b)\n(d)\n(f)\nFIG. 1. Log-log plot of the eigenvalue spectrum of 1 2 (F + FT ) versus the correlation length \u03be for the spin-1/2 isotropic quantum XY chain. The correlation length of an MPS with a certain bond dimension is calculated by Eq. (40) in Ref. [20]. Notice that in (e) there is one decaying \u03bb hidden in the bulk of larger eigenvalues but it becomes visible at larger correlation lengths.\nthe eigenvectors G associated with the decaying eigenvalues are shown in Table I. For p = 0, there are 1, 3, 5 eigenvalues decaying with the correlation length for N = 1, 2, 3, respectively; for p = \u03c0, there are 0, 2, 4 eigenvalues decaying with the correlation length for N = 1, 2, 3, respectively. The eigenvector G = XX+Y Y corresponds to the Hamiltonian in Eq. (6), so as a byproduct our method is also able to determine the local parent Hamiltonian [35\u201337] solely from its ground state. We notice that the decay has a power-law scaling \u03bb \u223c \u03be\u2212\u03b7\u2032 [38] and the exponents are listed in Table I. All other eigenvalues increase or stay constant with the increasing correlation length. The G\u2019s associated with the decaying \u03bb\u2019s are local integrals of motion since \u03bb is extrapolated to 0 at infinite correlation length. While the conserved quantities in Table I and more conserved quantities for larger N in the XY model can be constructed recursively [21] through the master symmetry approach [6, 30\u201332, 39], our method provides an alternative way to obtain them generally.\nExtended symmetries by emergent symmetries.\u2014The ground state of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain is expected to have an emergent symmetry in addition to the microscopic SU(2) symmetry of the lattice Hamiltonian, and thus the symmetry is extended to SO(4) = [SU(2)L\u00d7SU(2)R]/Z2 [5, 40].

Eigenvalue spectrum for the spin-1/2 J-Q Heisenberg model after imposing microscopic symmetries. The G\u2019s associated with the blue (red) dots are parity even (odd) and time reversal odd (even). The scaling dimension of the G associated with the faded dots is not one and thus they are not emergent continuous internal symmetries. The green curve in (e) corresponds to the Hamiltonian. Notice that in (d)(f) one solution corresponding to one of the three generators for the exact SU(2) symmetry of the microscopic Hamiltonian is not shown since it is well below 10\u22126. We use a sublattice rotation about the z axis by angle \u03c0 when using VUMPS to optimize the ground state, so the x and y components of the generators move to p = \u03c0.\nincreases, which is obvious from the drop of the corresponding eigenvalues. At N = 2, mn,\u03b1 = \u03f5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3S \u03b2 nS \u03b3 n+1 with \u03f5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 the Levi-Civita symbol; at N = 3, nextnearest neighbor term shows up and we have mn,\u03b1 = \u03f5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3(w1S \u03b2 nS \u03b3 n+1 +w2S \u03b2 nS \u03b3 n+2) with w2/w1 \u2248 0.2253 [44]. The form of the 3-site mn,\u03b1 looks very similar to the level-1 Yangian [45\u201347]\u2014which are exact conserved quantities of the RG fixed point, the Haldane-Shastry model [48, 49]\u2014truncated to the next-nearest neighbor coupling, though with different coupling coefficients [21]. When going toN = 4, the contribution from longer-range coupling in the level-1 Yangian appears with all coupling coefficients modified. Moreover, terms from the level-3 Yangian begin to be involved. We get mn,\u03b1 = m 1 n,\u03b1 + m3n,\u03b1, where m 1 n,\u03b1 = \u03f5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3(w1S \u03b2 nS \u03b3 n+1 + w2S \u03b2 nS \u03b3 n+2 + w3S \u03b2 nS \u03b3 n+3) and m 3 n,\u03b1 = \u03f5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 [ u1S \u03b2 nS \u03b3 n+3Sn+1 \u00b7 Sn+2 + u2Sn \u00b7 Sn+3S\u03b2n+1S \u03b3 n+2 + u3(S \u03b2 nS \u03b3 n+1Sn+2 \u00b7 Sn+3 + Sn \u00b7 Sn+1S\u03b2n+2S \u03b3 n+3) + u4(S \u03b2 nS \u03b3 n+2Sn+1 \u00b7 Sn+3 + Sn \u00b7 Sn+2S \u03b2 n+1S \u03b3 n+3) ] , with w2/w1 \u2248 0.3557, w3/w1 \u2248 0.1467, u1/w1 \u2248 0.1577, u2/w1 \u2248 \u22120.09690, u3/w1 \u2248 \u22120.09141, and u4/w1 \u2248 0.08169.

When pushing to N = 4, longer-ranged terms further dress G1 and G2 [21]. Our algorithm hence allows us to decorate upon the bare form of the lattice operators for emergent symmetry generators found through field theory analysis, and therefore to obtain a more precise picture of the microscopic nature of the emergent symmetries.\nConclusions.\u2014We have presented a novel general method to numerically detect emergent continuous internal symmetries in critical systems. The bottom line is that emergent symmetries do not just reveal themselves indirectly in the long-distance behavior of correlation functions\u2014which has been the sole detection mechanism before our work\u2014but are actually realized surprisingly accurately on the lattice, albeit with spatially extended generators. We have illustrated this by rediscovering the theory-predicted lattice operators for the emergent conserved currents at a 1D DQCP and sharply improving them with newly discovered correction terms. We have also identified the effective lattice operators of the conserved charges for the extended SO(4) symmetry in the J-Q chain with Yangian generators truncated to local terms, which were unknown before. The ability of our method to crack the explicit form of these lattice generators allows us to construct the emergent lattice KacMoody generators to unprecedented accuracy for both Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries [54] in generic settings.\nOutlook.\u2014This method could in principle be generalized to 2D, to extract emergent lattice conserved currents\nin the projected entangled pair states (PEPS) [55\u201357], which would be of particular use for the study of higherdimensional DQCP. A variant version with a larger unit cell can be easily derived. It is also worth exploring if a similar algorithm works for finite systems with periodic or other boundary conditions, for the low-energy excited states [58], or for classical systems. Adjusting this method to find unconventional symmetries of the weaklyentangled higher excited states [59, 60] or the emergent space-time symmetry [61] would be also interesting directions.\nThe complexity of the eigenvalue problem scales exponentially with N . To reduce the complexity of solving for G of larger size, we could resort to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [15, 16] by treating G as an N -site finite matrix product operator (MPO) [62, 63], and the tricky part will be removing the trivial solutions efficiently [21, 24]. It would also be desirable to include terms with long-range tails by representing O as an infinite MPO [64], though its implementation encounters some technical difficulties [21].

[24] Notice that there always exist trivial solutions of the form G = X \u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297 X for p = 0 and G = X \u2297 I + I \u2297 X for p = \u03c0, with X being any N \u2212 1-site operator (except the identity) and I being the one-site identity. The N - site identity is also a trivial solution by regularization. The eigenvalues associated with those trivial solutions are exactly zero. In total they span a large trivial null space of dimension d2(N\u22121), where d is the dimension of the one-site physical Hilbert space. We have removed the trivial solutions from all of our results. Interested readers can go to the supplementary material [21] for how to remove the trivial solutions.

IMPOSING HERMITICITY\nIn the main text, we mentioned that it can be proved that the eigenvectors G are guaranteed to be Hermitian up to an arbitrary overall phase. In the following, we will explain why this is true.\nTo make U = e\u2212i\u03f5O unitary, O must be Hermitian. For p = 0 or p = \u03c0, G should also be Hermitian. Supposing Gn is a N -site Hermitian operator starting at site n, then\nGn = d2N\u2211 \u03b1=1 c\u03b1vn,\u03b1, (S1)\nwhere c\u03b1 is real and v\u03b1 is a N -site Kronecker product of the 1-site Hermitian basis operators { 1\u221a2dI, T1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Td2\u22121}, with d the dimension of the 1-site Hilbert space and Ti the SU(d) generator in the fundamental representation. Let\u2019s take p = 0 as an example. In this case, we have O = \u2211 nGn. The cost function will then become\nf = \u27e8\u03c8|O\u2020O|\u03c8\u27e9 V Tr[G\u2020G] =\n\u2211 n,m \u2211 \u03b1,\u03b2 c\u03b1c\u03b2\u27e8\u03c8|vm,\u03b2vn,\u03b1|\u03c8\u27e9\nV \u2211\n\u03b1,\u03b2 c\u03b1c\u03b2Tr(v\u03b1v\u03b2) =\n2N \u2211\nn \u2211 \u03b1,\u03b2 c\u03b1c\u03b2\u27e8\u03c8|v0,\u03b2vn,\u03b1|\u03c8\u27e9\u2211\n\u03b1 c 2 \u03b1\n= 2N cT \u00b7M \u00b7 c cT \u00b7 c , (S2)\nwhere we have used the fact that Tr(v\u03b1v\u03b2) = 1 2N \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 and translational invariance, with M\u03b2\u03b1 = \u2211 n \u27e8\u03c8|v0,\u03b2vn,\u03b1|\u03c8\u27e9. (S3)\nThen the first derivative becomes\n\u2202f \u2202c\u03b3 = 2N\n( \u2211\nn \u2211 \u03b2 c\u03b2\u27e8\u03c8|v0,\u03b2vn,\u03b3 |\u03c8\u27e9+ \u2211 n \u2211 \u03b1 c\u03b1\u27e8\u03c8|v0,\u03b3vn,\u03b1|\u03c8\u27e9)( \u2211 \u03b1 c 2 \u03b1)\u2212 ( \u2211 n \u2211 \u03b1,\u03b2 c\u03b1c\u03b2\u27e8\u03c8|v0,\u03b2vn,\u03b1|\u03c8\u27e9)(2c\u03b3)\n( \u2211\n\u03b1 c 2 \u03b1) 2 = 2N [ (cT \u00b7M)\u03b3 + (M \u00b7 c)\u03b3\ncT \u00b7 c \u2212 2(c T \u00b7M \u00b7 c)c\u03b3 (cT \u00b7 c)2\n] .\n(S4)\nii\nIf we let \u2202f\u2202c\u03b3 = 0, we will get\n(cT \u00b7M)\u03b3 + (M \u00b7 c)\u03b3 = 2(cT \u00b7M \u00b7 c)\ncT \u00b7 c c\u03b3 , (S5)\nor\n[(MT +M) \u00b7 c]\u03b3 = cT \u00b7 (MT +M) \u00b7 c\ncT \u00b7 c c\u03b3 . (S6)\nTherefore, in order to minimize f , we need to solve the eigenvalue problem\n(MT +M) \u00b7 c = 2\u03bb\u0303minc (S7)\nwith the constraint that c is a real vector, which is automatically satisfied. This could be proved as the following. By utilizing translational invariance and the Hermiticity of vn,\u03b1, we can get that M is Hermitian, i.e.\nM\u2217\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2211 n \u27e8\u03c8|v0,\u03b1vn,\u03b2 |\u03c8\u27e9\u2217 = \u2211 n \u27e8\u03c8|v\u2212n,\u03b1v0,\u03b2 |\u03c8\u27e9\u2217 = \u2211 n \u27e8\u03c8|vn,\u03b1v0,\u03b2 |\u03c8\u27e9\u2217 = \u2211 n \u27e8\u03c8|v0,\u03b2vn,\u03b1|\u03c8\u27e9 =M\u03b2\u03b1. (S8)\nSo\nM\u2217\u03b1\u03b2 +M \u2217 \u03b2\u03b1 =M\u03b2\u03b1 +M\u03b1\u03b2 , (S9)\nor\n(MT +M)\u2217 =M +MT , (S10)\ni.e. MT +M is a real symmetric matrix, and hence it is guaranteed that it has real eigenvectors. Thus the G we obtain in this way will be automatically Hermitian operators.\nAlternatively, we do not need to explicitly write Gn in the form of Eq. (S1) and solve the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of MT +M . Instead, we could simply solve the eigenvalue problem of FT + F , as stated in the main text, and its eigenvectors will be guaranteed to be Hermitian operators up to an arbitrary overall phase, which can be proved as follows. One could see that MT +M and FT + F are mapped to each other by\n(MT +M)\u03b1\u03b2 = v T \u03b1 \u00b7 (FT + F) \u00b7 v\u03b2 , (S11)\nwhere v\u03b1 is a N -site Hermitian basis operator defined previously. Therefore, the eigenvalue problem of M T +M in Eq. (S7) is equivalent to\nUT (FT + F)U \u00b7 c = 2\u03bb\u0303minc (S12)\nor\n(FT + F)U \u00b7 c = 2\u03bbminU \u00b7 c, (S13)\nwhere \u03bbmin = 2 N \u03bb\u0303min and U = (v1, . . . , vd2N ) is a basis transformation in the d 2N -dimensional complex space. Thus U \u00b7 c gives the G in Eq. (S1). Because c is real and v\u03b1 is Hermitian, the eigenvectors of FT +F are guaranteed to be Hermitian.\nII. IMPOSING MICROSCOPIC SYMMETRIES\nImposing the symmetries of the microscopic Hamiltonian will help to largely reduce the number of variational parameters and thus lower the complexity of the eigenvalue problem.\nIf the critical one-dimensional system is described by a CFT, the emergent conserved charges will be the zero modes of the Kac-Moody generators, J\u03b10 and J\u0304 \u03b1 0 . For J \u03b1 0 + J\u0304 \u03b1 0 , it would be time reversal odd and parity even; for J \u03b1 0 \u2212 J\u0304\u03b10 , it would be time reversal even and parity odd. In addition, quantum spin Hamiltonians usually also have spin flip symmetries, and both J\u03b10 and J\u0304 \u03b1 0 will transform in the same way under the spin flip.\nIf we write G in the form of Eq. (S1) and solve the eigenvalue problem of MT +M to optimize c, it will be easy to impose microscopic symmetries. For example, if d = 2, since T \u03c3\u20d7T \u22121 = \u2212\u03c3\u20d7, to impose time-reversal symmetry, we can require the sum in Eq. (S1) to only include v\u03b1 with odd (even) number of Pauli matrices to make G odd (even)\niii\nunder the time reversal; to impose parity symmetry, we can require the coefficients c\u03b1 to be \u2212c\u03b2 (c\u03b2) if v\u03b1 parity\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 v\u03b2 to make G odd (even) under the parity transformation. If we use the FT + F formalism, in principle we could restrict the entries in G similarly. But a more convenient way to impose microscopic symmetries when N is not large is to apply projection operators. For example, to make the eigenvector time-reversal even, one could solve the eigenvalue problem of P+(FT +F)P+ instead, where P+ is the projection operator onto the time-reversal even subspace. The operation P+ \u00b7 x could be implemented by mapping x to x+ T x. In this way, all the time-reversal odd G will move to the null space. When N is not large, we can solve all the eigenvalues from the largest magnitude until we reach the null space and obtain the associated eigenvectors, and by the way we also exclude all the trivial solutions.\nIII. REMOVING TRIVIAL SOLUTIONS\nAs mentioned in footnote [24] of the main text, there is an issue to be remembered\u2013the number of trivial solutions is large, i.e. d2(N\u22121), where d is the dimension of the local Hilbert space, so it would be desired to remove those trivial solutions.\nIt is easy to remove the trivial solutions in the MT +M formalism by restricting the operator strings v\u03b1 involved in Eq. (S1). We first need to exclude the N -site identity in Eq. (S1). To further avoid the p = 0 trivial solutions of the form X \u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297X (similarly for p = \u03c0), we can fix the coefficient in front of the term X \u2297 I and I \u2297X in Eq. (S1) to be the same, without losing any generality, since it simply means that those terms can only appear as N \u2212 1 site G = X in a symmetric form in the N -site G.\nIn the FT+F formalism, as mentioned in the last section, when N is small, one could simply solve all the eigenvalues above the null space to exclude the trivial solutions. More generally, one could get rid of these trivial solutions by lifting those trivial solutions to the top of the spectrum, i.e. F \u2192 F +\u03b1Ptrivial, where a is some positive real number larger than \u03bbmax of F and Ptrivial is the projection operator onto the trivial solution subspace. To obtain Ptrivial, we can consider the following problem to find the projection of a given operator G onto the trivial solution subspace, i.e.\nmin X\n\u2225G\u2212 (X \u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297X)\u22252, (S14)\nwhere X \u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297X is the form of the trivial solution at p = 0. By differentiating with respect to X, we get\nX = 1\n2d  G \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u2212 G \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n+ X \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n+ X \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  , (S15)\nwhich gives us a linear equation for X. If we map an operator X to a state |X\u27e9, the above equation becomes\nA|X\u27e9 = |b\u27e9, (S16)\nwhere\nA = ... \u2212 1 2d ( ... ... + ... ... ) (S17)\nand\n|X\u27e9 = X ...\n...\n(S18)\nand\n|b\u27e9 = 1 2d  G ... ...\n\u2212 G ...\n...  . (S19) A has a null vector |I\u27e9 since A|I\u27e9 = 0. But I \u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297 I = 0, so in the solution we can let the coefficient in front of the null vector to be zero without losing any generality. As a result, we get |X\u27e9 = pinv(A)|b\u27e9, where pinv(A) is the pseudo-inverse of A. Finally, the projection operator onto the trivial solution subspace should be\nPtrivial = 1\n2d\n( pinv(A) ...\n...\n+ pinv(A)\n...\n... \u2212 pinv(A) ...\n... \u2212 pinv(A) ...\n...\n) . (S20)\niv\nThen we can perform F \u2192 \u2212(F +\u03b1Ptrivial) to shift the trivial solution subspace to the top and reverse the spectrum so that the problem transforms to solving for the largest eigenvalues. Ptrivial is model independent, so for each N we only need to solve for pinv(A) once.\nIV. FINITE-SYSTEM DMRG TO OPTIMIZE G\nIn the FT + F formalism, if we treat G as a single big tensor, the complexity of the optimization problem will grow exponentially as N increases. Alternatively, we can write G as a finite matrix product operator (MPO) and use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [15, 16] to optimize it. Note that if we transform to the MT +M formalism, i.e. using the operator string v\u03b1 basis, the coefficient c\u03b1 can also be expressed as an MPO, and the advantage of using this basis is that the eigenvalue problem can be solved within real numbers.\nNow let\u2019s take N = 5 as an example. A 5-site finite MPO is illustrated as\nG = W1 W2 W3 W4 W5 . (S21)\nDifferent from treating G as a single big tensor, at each iteration we assume all but one site tensor Wi constant and differentiate the cost function f with respect to Wi only. If we let G in its canonical form, just like an MPS, we will get an eigenvalue problem for Wi at each iteration. We solve for the lowest eigenvalue at each iteration, and after several DMRG sweeps through the 5 sites we get a G corresponding to \u03bbmin. Then we can construct a projection operator P = |G\u27e9\u27e8G|. Modifying the cost function to be F + \u03b2P to lift this solution to the top of the spectrum, we perform the DMRG again to solve for the next solution.\nRemoving the large number of trivial solutions is essential for doing DMRG efficiently. In principle, we could do the same thing as in the last section. However, performing efficient DMRG requires us to have pinv(A) either in the form of an MPO or decomposition of some local operators, while we currently do not have a good approach to efficiently calculate pinv(A) when N becomes larger.\nV. THE INFINITE UNIFORM MPO FORMALISM\nA more natural representation for O, which is able to hold long-range interacting terms in the summation, would be the finite state automaton [62, 63], which can be translated to a infinite uniform MPO. This formalism also helps to reduce the complexity of the problem by solving for only one MPO site tensor and restricting the form of G to certain combination of Pauli strings. Here, we explain how to optimize a MPO for O of bond dimension \u03c7W = 2, and show that the optimization for this MPO gives the same eigenvalue problem as in the main text. However, generalization from \u03c7W = 2 to \u03c7W > 2 is non-trivial and we leave it as an open question.\nThe MPO representation of O is\nO = . . . W W W W W . . . , (S22)\nwhere W is an operator-valued matrix given by\nW = [ 1 G 0 1 ] . (S23)\nThen\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u2202O \u2020\n\u2202G\u2020 O|\u03c8\u27e9 = L[W\u0304W ]\nA\u0304C\nW\nAC\nR[W\u0304W ]\n1 2\n= D12,11W11+D 12,12W12+D 12,21W21+D 12,22W22 = D 12,111+D12,12G+D12,221.\n(S24)\nv Therefore we only need to calculate the fixed points (L [W\u0304W ] 1,1 |, |R [W\u0304W ] 2,1 ), (L [W\u0304W ] 1,2 |, |R [W\u0304W ] 2,2 ), which are defined as\n(L [W\u0304W ] a,b | = \u2211 (a\u2032,b\u2032)\u2264(a,b) (L [W\u0304W ] a\u2032,b\u2032 |(T [W\u0304W ] L )a\u2032,b\u2032;a,b, |R [W\u0304W ] a,b ) = \u2211 (a\u2032,b\u2032)\u2265(a,b) (T [W\u0304W ] R )a,b;a\u2032,b\u2032 |R [W\u0304W ] a\u2032,b\u2032 ), (S25)\nwhere\n(T [W\u0304W ] L/R )a\u2032,b\u2032;a,b = \u2211 s,s\u2032,s\u2032\u2032 A\u0304s \u2032\u2032 L/R \u2297 W\u0304 s\u2032,s\u2032\u2032 a\u2032,a \u2297W s,s\u2032 b\u2032,b \u2297A s L/R. (S26)\nNotice that W\u0304 \u2297W is still upper-triangular and there are two additional identities in the diagonal elements, i.e.\nW\u0304 \u2297W =  1 G G\u2020 1 0 1 0 G\u2020\n0 0 1 G 0 0 0 1  . (S27) From the definition, substituting the form of W , we get (L\n[W\u0304W ] 1,1 | = (L [W\u0304W ] 1,1 |TL, where TL is the transfer operator\nof the MPS |\u03c8[AL]\u27e9, so we have (L[W\u0304W ]1,1 | = (1|, where (1| is the left fixed point of TL. We can then get (L [W\u0304W ] 1,2 | = (L [W\u0304W ] 1,2 |TL + (Y1,2|, where\n(Y1,2| = G\nA\u0304L\nAL\n. (S28)\nTo remove the divergence from \u27e8O\u27e9, one needs instead to solve the linear equation\n(L [W\u0304W ] 1,2 |(1\u2212 TL + |R)(1|) = (Y1,2| \u2212 (Y1,2|R)(1| (S29)\nto get (L [W\u0304W ] 1,2 |. Similarly we can get |R [W\u0304W ] 2,2 ) = |1) and\n(1\u2212 TR + |1)(L|)|R[W\u0304W ]2,1 ) = |Y2,1)\u2212 |1)(L|Y2,1), (S30)\nwhere\n|Y2,1) = G\nA\u0304R\nAR\n. (S31)\nTherefore D12,11 and D12,22 are proportional to G and D12,12 has no G dependence. It is easy to see that D12,111+ D12,12G+D12,221 is equivalent to F \u00b7 g in the main text. If we require the normalization Tr[G\u2020G] = 1, then we get the same eigenvalue problem as in the main text. So the \u03c7W = 2 MPO formalism is equivalent to representing O as a summation of local terms in the case that G is one-site.\nHowever, this equivalence could not be generalized to \u03c7W > 2. For example, the most generic form for \u03c7W = 3 is\nW = 1 A B0 D C 0 0 1  . (S32) If we want there to be some exponentially decaying interacting term, then D = \u03ba1 with \u03ba < 1. There are several issues to optimize W . First, considering the simplest case with D = 0, the O generated by W would be \u2211 n(AnCn+1 +Bn), and \u27e8\u03c8|O\u2020O|\u03c8\u27e9 contain terms linear in A, B, and C, so taking its derivative with respect to A, B, or C would not give us an eigenvalue problem, but one might be able to use the gradient descent method. The second question would be how to choose a proper normalization condition for W , especially when there is an exponentially decaying term. Simply requiring A, B, and C each to be individually normalized does not make sense. Probably the canonical form [64] for such Hamiltonian-like MPO might help.\nvi\nVI. METHOD BASED ON THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF MPS\nIn footnote [25] of the main text, we mentioned that solving the symmetry of the ground state of a gapped system is much easier, and another method based on the MPS fundamental theorem also works. In this section, we will discuss this alternative method for gapped systems and why it does not work well for critical systems.\nIf an MPS\n|\u03a8(A)\u27e9 = . . . A A A A A . . . . (S33)\nis symmetric under a global on-site symmetry operation, the MPS tensor itself transforms under this operation [20]:\nU\u2297Ng |\u03a8(A)\u27e9 \u221d |\u03a8(A)\u27e9 \u2192\nUg\nA = ei\u03d5g Vg Vg\u2020A . (S34)\nIf the symmetry transformation is continuous, we can write Ug = e i\u03f5G. After absorbing the phase factor ei\u03d5g into the definition of G, the infinitesimal version becomes\n1+ i\u03f5G\nA = 1+ i\u03f5K 1\u2212 i\u03f5KA (S35)\nor\nG\nA = K A \u2212 KA . (S36)\nAfter vectorizing G 7\u2192 g and K 7\u2192 k, the above equation becomes[ P Q\u2212R ] [g k ] = 0, (S37)\nwhere Pi\u03b1\u03b2,jl = \u03b4ijA l \u03b1\u03b2 , Qi\u03b1\u03b2,\u03b3\u03c1 = \u03b4\u03c1\u03b2A i \u03b1\u03b3 , and Ri\u03b1\u03b2,\u03b3\u03c1 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b3A i \u03c1\u03b2 . The equation can be transformed into a least square problem\nmin x\n\u2225M \u00b7 x\u2225 (S38)\nwith constraint \u2225x\u22252 = 1, where M = [P Q \u2212 R] and x = [g k]T . This problem can be solved by either quadratic programming or singular value decomposition (SVD) M = USV \u2020, where S = diag(\u03bb1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03bbd2+D2) and V = (v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,vd2+D2).\nWhile it works for gapped systems, this way to solve for the symmetries is numerically unstable for the critical systems. In the benchmarks for the 1D isotropic XY model, it was observed that the singular vector vi whose first d 2 components best approximate the symmetry generator Sz does not always correspond to the second lowest singular value \u03bbd2+D2\u22121 (the trivial solution is the lowest one). In addition, the SVD only requires the orthogonality[\ng k ]\u2020 [g\u2032\nk\u2032\n] = 0 (S39)\nbut not necessarily g\u2020g\u2032 = 0, so there are many vj \u2019s that have nonzero overlap with (Sz,K). Also, we didn\u2019t see a clear scaling of the singular values with the correlation length.\nFurthermore,M is not gauge invariant and so are its singular values. If we work in the mixed gauge, the infinitesimal version of the fundamental theorem becomes\nG\nAC = K AR \u2212 KAL (S40)\nvii\nwith AC = LAR, AL = LAL \u22121, and AR = R \u22121AR. Notice that the trivial solution now becomes (G,K) = (0, C), where C = LR. In the benchmarks for the 1D isotropic XY model, we could see a clear scaling of the singular values with the correlation length \u03be. However, the problems are only partially solved by utilizing the mixed gauge. g in the singular vectors is still not orthogonal to each other. As a result, we observed that the number of singular values that scales to zero with increasing correlation length is much larger than the number of symmetries the system actually has, though there is a gap between the lowest ones and the higher ones. The D2 useless degrees of freedom for K also increase the complexity of the problem and make the solution quickly become unreachable as N and D increases. In addition, the singular values are not very physical, since they are still gauge dependent. In conclusion, for critical systems one should resort to the variational method in the main text.\nNote that the on-site symmetry \u2297 n Ug = exp (\u2212i\u03f5 \u2211\nnGn) can be generalized to a continuous symmetry U = exp (\u2212i\u03f5O) generated by a summation of N -site local Hermitian operators O = \u2211 nGn,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n+N\u22121, which takes a similar form to a local Hamiltonian. If the state is invariant under the transformation, i.e. exp (\u2212i\u03f5O)|\u03c8\u27e9 = |\u03c8\u27e9 (the phase factor has been absorbed into the definition of O), it implies equivalently O|\u03c8\u27e9 = \u2211 nGn,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n+N\u22121|\u03c8\u27e9 = 0, or\nAL AC AR\nG\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n= K AR \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 AL K \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(S41)\nfor injective MPS, where G is a N -site operator and K is a N \u2212 1-site tensor. Now there are d2(N\u22121) trivial solutions, which take the form G = X \u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297X, where X is a N \u2212 1-site operator and I is the one-site identity operator.\nVII. CONSERVED QUANTITIES IN THE SPIN-1/2 ISOTROPIC QUANTUM XY CHAIN\nIn this section, we review the master symmetry [30] technique to obtain the conserved quantities in the spin-1/2 isotropic quantum XY chain.\nThe Hamiltonian of the spin-1/2 isotropic quantum XY chain can be written as\nH = \u2211 i hi (S42)\nwhere hi = XiXi+1 + YiYi+1. Obviously, H has a U(1) symmetry and thus [H,Q0] = 0, where Q0 = \u2211\ni Zi. Each term in the conserved quantity Q1 = \u2211 i(XiYi+1 \u2212 YiXi+1) can be obtained by Eq. (46) in Ref. [6], i.e.\n2i(XiYi+1 \u2212 YiXi+1) = [hi, Zi]. If we denote H0 = H, each term in level-n conserved quantities Hn = \u2211\ni hn,i and Qn = \u2211 i qn,i can be constructed recursively up to a constant by\nhn+1,i \u221d [hi, Hn], if n \u2265 0; (S43a) qn+1,i \u221d [hi, Qn], if n \u2265 1. (S43b)\nFor example, we have H1 = \u2211 i(XiZi+1Yi+2\u2212YiZi+1Xi+2), and Q2 = \u2211\ni(XiZi+1Xi+2+YiZi+1Yi+2). One can verify that\n[Hn, Hm] = [Hn, Qm] = [Qn, Qm] = 0. (S44)\nFor p = \u03c0 we could get in a similar way the conserved quantities that take a staggered pattern in the summation, K = \u2211 i(\u22121)iki.\nVIII. EXPLANATION OF THE CRITICAL EXPONENTS OF THE CONSERVED QUANTITIES IN THE SPIN-1/2 ISOTROPIC QUANTUM XY CHAIN\nFor a correlation function C(r, \u03be) = \u27e8\u03c8|G\u2020n+rGn|\u03c8\u27e9 near the critical point, it takes the form [28]\nC(r, \u03be) = r\u2212\u03b7g(r/\u03be), (S45)\nwhere \u03b7 = 2\u2206 is double the scaling dimension of the operator G. Since the effect of finite bond dimension is like a relevant perturbation which deforms the MPS away from the exact critical point, the correlation function calculated\nviii\nwith MPS should also take this form. In the continuuum limit, the static structure factor S at momentum p = 0 is given by\nS(\u03be) = 2 \u222b \u221e 0 drr\u2212\u03b7g(r/\u03be), (S46)\nwhich should be invariant under a change of integration variable x = \u03bbr, i.e. S(\u03be) = 2\u03bb\u03b7\u22121 \u222b \u221e 0 dxx\u2212\u03b7g(x/(\u03bb\u03be)) = \u03bb\u03b7\u22121S(\u03bb\u03be). (S47)\nTherefore, we have S(\u03bb\u03be) = \u03bb\u2212(\u03b7\u22121)S(\u03be), which yields\nS(\u03be) \u223c \u03be\u2212(\u03b7\u22121), (S48) i.e. the critical exponent for S(\u03be) is given by the critical exponent for the corresponding correlation function minus one, and to make S(\u03be) decay with increasing \u03be it requires \u03b7 > 1. However, we find the above argument is oversimplified and thus does not generally hold. In TABLE I, one could observe that generally \u03b7\u2032 \u0338= \u03b7\u22121 except for Z and XZX+Y ZY . Actually, the value of \u03b7\u2032 is extracted from calculation not in the continuum limit but within the discrete lattice, so\nS(\u03be) = 2 \u221e\u2211 r=1 C(r, \u03be) + C(0, \u03be). (S49)\nFor XX + Y Y at p = 0, since C(r, \u03be = \u221e) \u223c (\u22121)r+1r\u22122, for terms at large r the sum reduces to\u2211 r C(r, \u03be) \u223c \u2211 odd r [ 1 r2 \u2212 1 (r + 1)2 ] = \u2211 odd r 1 r2 [ 1\u2212 ( 1 + 1 r )\u22122] \u2248 \u2211 odd r 2 r3 . (S50)\nTherefore effectively \u03b7 becomes 3 and thus the relation \u03b7\u2032 = \u03b7\u2212 1 still holds. For XX \u2212Y Y and XY +Y X at p = \u03c0, it could be argued similarly.\nIn fact, we found that \u03b7\u2032 depends on the behavior of the correlation function calculated with MPS not only in the infrared limit but at all distances. For a MPS, C(r, \u03be) \u223c r\u2212\u03b7e\u2212r/\u03be [28] is only true when r is much larger than the lattice spacing, and thus there is a certain range \u039b < r < \u03be\u2032 where C(r, \u03be) \u223c r\u2212\u03b7. At short distance r < \u039b, the behavior of C(r, \u03be) relies on microscopic details. At sufficiently large distance r \u226b \u03be\u2032, we have C(r, \u03be) \u223c e\u2212r/\u03be. As a result, weird cancellation can happen to give the final value of \u03b7\u2032 for XZY \u2212Y ZX, XZX\u2212Y ZY , and XZY +Y ZX, and it does not follow the previous simple argument.\nNotice that the correlation length manifested in the correlation function calculated with MPS can be different from the correlation length obtained by the formula \u03be = \u2212 1log|\u03bb2/\u03bb1| , where \u03bbi is the ith largest eigenvalue of the MPS transfer matrix T = \u2211 i \u03bbi|\u03bbi)(\u03bbi|. Define\n(G| = G ...\n...\nA\u0304L\nAL\nA\u0304L\nAL\n. (S51)\nix\nThe reason is that (G|\u03bbi) can be zero for the first several \u03bbi\u2019s, depending on the charge G carries, and thus the correlation length will be instead given by \u03be = \u2212 1log|\u03bbj/\u03bb1| , where \u03bbj is the largest eigenvalue of T that satisfies (G|\u03bbj) \u0338= 0. Nevertheless, we find that \u03bbi = \u03bbai2 for i > 2, which will only bring a constant prefactor ai to the correlation length and therefore will not affect the scaling.\nIX. MORE RESULTS OF THE SPIN-1/2 J-Q MODEL\nAt the transition point Q/J \u2248 0.84831, we first use VUMPS with 1-site unit cell to obtain the ground state for various bond dimensions from \u03c7 = 10 to \u03c7 = 400 until the gradient converges to 10\u221212 and then apply our algorithm to these uniform MPS. When doing VUMPS, we only require the MPS to be real so as to impose time-reversal symmetry but not impose any other microscopic symmetries. When applying our algorithm to the MPS obtained by VUMPS from N = 2, we impose the time-reversal, parity, and spin-flip symmetries as mentioned in the previous section. Since the one-site unit cell enforces translational invariance, we would get a (non-injective) equal weight superposition of all translational symmetry broken MPS ground state approximation, if it energetically favors a translational symmetry broken ground state within finite bond dimension, and thus it would limit the precision VUMPS can reach [19]. To avoid this, we perform a sublattice spin rotation around the z-axis by angle \u03c0 when doing VUMPS, which is important for it to converge. Due to this sublattice rotation, the x and y components of the generators move to p = \u03c0.\nAs a supplemental, here we also show the data for N = 1, where we obtain the three generators for the microscopic SU(2) symmetry. For p = 0, we get only one decaying solution, G = Z (blue curve in Fig. S1(a)); for p = \u03c0, we get two decaying solutions corresponding to the other microscopic SU(2) generators X and Y (blue curve and scattered points below it in Fig. S1(b)). Notice that most of those scattered points are well below 10\u22128 and not shown.\n10 1 10 2 10 3\n10 -4\n10 -2\n10 0\n10 1 10 2 10 3 10 -8\n10 -6\n10 -4\n10 -2\n10 0\n(a) (b)N = 1, p = 0 N = 1, p = \u03c0\nFIG. S1. Log-log plots of the non-trivial eigenvalue spectrum (without imposing microscopic symmetries) of F versus the correlation length \u03be for the spin-1/2 J-Q chain at Q/J \u2248 0.84831 when N = 1.\nThe conservation of currents in 1 + 1d implies their scaling dimension must be 1 [5], which means their correlation functions should decay as r\u22122. This is indeed the case as shown in Fig. S2, which plots the correlation function of qz and mz for different N , where Qz = \u2211 x qz(x) and Mz = \u2211 xmz(x) are the zero modes of the Kac-Moody generators. We can see that\n\u27e8qz(0)qz(r)\u27e9 \u223c c1(\u22121)rr\u22121 + c2r\u22122, \u27e8mz(0)mz(r)\u27e9 \u223c r\u22122. (S52)\nNotice that \u27e8qz(0)qz(r)\u27e9 \u223c r\u22122 for even N because of the cancellation of the staggered part due to terms like G\u2297 I + I \u2297G, where G is a N \u2212 1-site operator, as listed in Table II. This cancellation can be explained as follows. If \u27e8G(0)G(r)\u27e9 \u223c c1(\u22121)rr\u22121 + c2r\u22122, then\n\u27e8(G\u2297 I + I \u2297G)(0)(G\u2297 I + I \u2297G)(r)\u27e9 =\u27e8G(0)G(r)\u27e9+ \u27e8G(0)G(r + 1)\u27e9+ \u27e8G(1)G(r)\u27e9+ \u27e8G(1)G(r + 1)\u27e9 =2[c1(\u22121)rr\u22121 + c2r\u22122] + c1(\u22121)r+1(r + 1)\u22121 + c2(r + 1)\u22122 + c1(\u22121)r\u22121(r \u2212 1)\u22121 + c2(r \u2212 1)\u22122 \u223c4c2r\u22122.\n(S53)\nNote that although for q\u03b1 at N > 2 we got longer-range decoration to the 1-site spin operator S\u03b1 from terms in higher even-level Yangian generators. Those decorations will finally vanish as the correlation length goes to infinity, as shown in Fig. S3.\nIn Fig. S4 we also show the extrapolation of the coefficient ratio in mz for N = 4.\nx 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 -2 10 0 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 -5 10 0 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 -5 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2\n10 0 10 1 10 2\n10 -7\n10 -5\n10 -3\n10 0 10 1 10 2\n10 -5\n10 0\n10 0 10 1 10 2\n10 -5\n10 0\n10 0 10 1 10 2\n10 -5\n10 0\n10 0 10 1 10 2\n10 -5\n10 0\nN = 1(a) N = 1, subleading(b) N = 3(c) N = 3, subleading(d)\nN = 4(e) N = 2(f) N = 3(g) N = 4(h)\nFIG.

The subleading part of the correlation function of the N -site operator G is obtained by measuring the correlation function of G\u2297 I + I \u2297G, and therefore the subleading part of the correlation function of the 1-site qz is equivalent to the correlation function of the 2-site qz.\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n500 1000 1500 2000\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\n0.45(a) N = 3 (b) N = 4\nFIG.

YANGIANS IN THE HALDANE-SHASTRY MODEL\nIn the last section, we mentioned that the lattice form of the Kac-Moody generators in the J-Q model looks like local truncation to the Yangian generators, which are exact symmetry of the Haldane-Shastry model. In this section, we give the explicit lattice forms of the Yangian generators up to level 3.\nYangian is a Hopf algebra and its level-n generators can be defined recursively starting from the level-0 and level-1 generators [47]. For SU(2), the level-0 generators are the usual global SU(2) generators, i.e. Q\u03b10 = \u2211 i S \u03b1 i . The level-1 generators are\nQ\u03b11 = 1\n2 \u2211 i \u0338=j wij i\u03f5 \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3S\u03b2i S \u03b3 j (S54)\nwith wij = (zi + zj)/(zi \u2212 zj) and zj = exp(2\u03c0ij/L), where L is the size of the system with periodic boundary condition. By utilizing the recursive relation\ni\u03f5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 [Q\u03b31 , Q \u03b2 n\u22121] = 2Q \u03b1 n, (S55)\nit can be derived that\nQ\u03b12 = 1\n12 (N \u2212 1)(N \u2212 2)Q\u03b10 \u2212 \u2211 i\u0338=j \u0338=k wijwkjS \u03b1 i Sj \u00b7 Sk (S56)\nand\nQ\u03b13 = 1\n6 (N \u2212 1)(N \u2212 2)Q\u03b11 +\n1\n2 \u2211 i \u0338=j \u0338=l \u0338=m wli(wml \u2212 wmi)(wjl \u2212 wji)i\u03f5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3S\u03b2i S \u03b3 j Sl \u00b7 Sm. (S57)\nWe could see that the odd (even) level Yangian generators are odd (even) under the parity transformation.\nXI. MORE RESULTS OF THE JIANG-MOTRUNICH MODEL\nAt K2x = K2z = 1/2, Jx = 1, Jz \u2248 1.4645, we perform VUMPS [22] with 1-site unit cell from bond dimension \u03c7 = 10 to \u03c7 = 400 until the gradient converges to 10\u221212 and then apply our algorithm. We also tried two-site unit cell but did not see a notable difference in the results.\n20 40 60 80\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08 0.1 0.12\n10 0 10 1 10 2\n10 -5\n10 1 10 2 10 -4\n10 -3\n10 0 10 1 10 2\n10 -5\n10 0 10 2 10 -10\n10 -5\n10 0 10 1 10 2\n10 -5\n10 0\n10 0 10 1 10 2\n10 -5\n10 0\n10 0 10 2 10 -10\n10 -5\nN = 1(a) N = 1, subleading(b) N = 3(c) N = 3, subleading(d)\nN = 4(e) N = 2(f) N = 3(g) N = 4(h)\nFIG. S5. The absolute value of the correlation function \u27e8G1(0)G1(x)\u27e9 and \u27e8G2(0)G2(x)\u27e9 measured with MPS of bond dimension \u03c7 = 240, where G1 and G2 are the optimal solution for MPS of bond dimension \u03c7 = 400. The subleading part of the correlation function of the N -site operator G is obtained by measuring the correlation function of G\u2297I\u2212I\u2297G, and therefore the subleading part of the correlation function of the 1-site G1 is equivalent to the correlation function of the 2-site G1.\nIn Fig. S5 we show the correlation function of G1 and G2 for different N and confirm that their scaling dimension is pinned at one. We can see that\n\u27e8G1(0)G1(r)\u27e9 \u223c c1r\u2212g/2 + c2(\u22121)rr\u22122, \u27e8G2(0)G2(r)\u27e9 \u223c (\u22121)rr\u22122, (S58)\nxiii\nwhere g \u2248 1.5 is the Luttinger parameter [8]. Notice that \u27e8G1(0)G1(r)\u27e9 \u223c (\u22121)rr\u22122 for even N because of the cancellation of the non-staggered part due to terms like G\u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297G, where G is a N \u2212 1-site operator, as listed in Table III. This cancellation can be explained as follows. If \u27e8G(0)G(r)\u27e9 \u223c c1r\u22121 + c2(\u22121)rr\u22122, then\n\u27e8(G\u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297G)(0)(G\u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297G)(r)\u27e9 =\u27e8G(0)G(r)\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e8G(0)G(r + 1)\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e8G(1)G(r)\u27e9+ \u27e8G(1)G(r + 1)\u27e9 =2[c1r \u22121 + c2(\u22121)rr\u22122]\u2212 c1(r + 1)\u22121 \u2212 c2(\u22121)r+1(r + 1)\u22122 \u2212 c1(r \u2212 1)\u22121 \u2212 c2(\u22121)r\u22121(r \u2212 1)\u22122 \u223c4c2(\u22121)rr\u22122.\n(S59)\nHere we also provide results of the eigenvalues of the optimization problem at p = 0 from N = 1 to N = 4.
