    "abstractText": "Affinity-based proteomic profiling is widely used for the identification of proteins involved in the formation of various interactomes. Since protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) reflect the role of particular proteins in the cell, identification of interaction partners for a protein of interest can reveal its function. The latter is especially important for the characterization of multifunctional proteins, which can play different roles in the cell. Pyruvate kinase (PK), a classical glycolytic enzyme catalyzing the last step of glycolysis, exists in four isoforms: PKM1, PKM2, PKL, and PKR. The enzyme isoform expressed in actively dividing cells, PKM2, exhibits many moonlighting (noncanonical) functions. In contrast to PKM2, PKM1, predominantly expressed in adult differentiated tissues, lacks welldocumented moonlighting functions. However, certain evidence exists that it can also perform some functions unrelated to glycolysis. In order to evaluate protein partners, bound to PKM1, in this study we have combined affinity-based separation of mouse brain proteins with mass spectrometry identification. The highly purified PKM1 and a 32-mer synthetic peptide (PK peptide), sharing high sequence homology with the interface contact region of all PK isoforms, were used as the affinity ligands. This proteomic profiling resulted in the identification of specific and common proteins bound to both affinity ligands. Quantitative affinity binding to the affinity ligands of selected identified proteins was validated using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. Bioinformatic analysis has shown that the identified proteins, bound to both full-length PKM1 and the PK peptide, form a protein network (interactome). Some of these interactions are relevant for the moonlighting functions of PKM1. The proteomic dataset is available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD041321.",

            "text": "Affinity-based proteomic profiling is a powerful approach used in proteomic studies for separation of various groups of proteins [1]. The combination of affinity chromatography with mass spectrometry represents an effective tool for the generation of a broad range of data for protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs), mapping post-translational modifications or recovering a certain target from the whole proteome, characterization of intracellular signaling networks and particular interactomes, etc. [2\u20136]. In the context of PPIs, so-called moonlighting proteins attract much interest because these proteins exhibit more than one function in the cell [7]. The repertoire of protein partners interacting with such moonlighting proteins significantly differs in the dependence of particular biochemical/physiological processes in which the moonlighting protein is involved. Currently, several hundred moonlighting proteins have been recognized [7\u201310]. Glycolytic enzymes are one of the most abundant groups of moonlighting proteins [10,11]. Pyruvate kinase (PK, EC 2.7.1.40) is a highly conserved enzyme catalyzing the irreversible\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 7634. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24087634 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nconversion of ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate to ATP and pyruvate (substrate-level phosphorylation reaction). Mammalian PK exists in four isoforms differed by expression patterns and regulatory properties: PKM1, PKM2, PKL, and PKR [12,13]. PK is most active as a tetramer, and dissociation into dimers and monomers results in its inactivation [13]. The isoform PKM2 is typical of embryonic and adult dividing cells [14]. Besides its role in glycolysis, PKM2 performs many moonlighting functions and participates in different cellular processes, such as: transcription, translation, signaling, and cytoskeletal dynamics [10,13\u201320]. In contrast to PKM2, PKM1 lacks well-documented moonlighting functions [14]. It is predominantly expressed in adult differentiated tissues including brain and musculature [12], and skeletal muscles are frequently used as the source for purification of this enzyme [21,22]. In the mouse brain, PKM1 was found in gray matter neurons and white matter bundles [23], but no functions of PKM1 unrelated to glycolysis have been reported so far. Certain evidence exists that PKM1 can perform some functions unrelated to its role in glycolysis. For example, a PKM1 monomer is known as a thyroid hormone (T3) binding protein [24]. PKM1 can bind to ribosomes [20,25]. In a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system, exogenously added PKM1-GST decreased the translation of some mRNAs [25]. In addition, PKM1 can form hetero-oligomers with other PK isoforms [13]. This suggests an important role of oligomer-to-monomer transition and the interface contact region that could be potentially involved in PKM1 functioning unrelated to glycolysis. Since classical and moonlighting functions obviously require different sets of protein partners, proteomic profiling with the protein of interest as an affinity ligand may give a hint for further search and research of its moonlighting. The latter is especially interesting in the context of PKM1, which shares high sequence similarity with PKM2 [26] and therefore could be considered \u201cas a substitute player in the PKM2 game\u201d. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate profiles of mouse brain proteins bound to the highly purified PKM1 or a synthetic 32-mer linear PK peptide. This PK peptide corresponds to the interface of PKL/R isoforms and exhibits high homology with PKM isoforms. Results of this study suggest that the profiles of proteins bound to either purified PKM1 or the PK peptide significantly differ. However, common proteins, bound to both full-length PKM1 and the PK peptide, form a protein network (interactome) that may reflect some moonlighting functions of PKM1."

In order to investigate the role of the PK interface in the PKM proteome formation we have compared profiles of mouse brain proteins bound to PKM1 and the PK peptide. The PK peptide corresponds to the sequence fragment (residues 406\u2013437) of PKR/L and shares high homology with PKM1 and PKM2. Proteomic profiling of cleared lysates of mouse brain homogenates performed using the immobilized PK peptide as the affinity ligand resulted in confident identification of\nmore than 75 individual proteins (Supplementary Table S2). These proteins fell into the same functional groups as the mouse proteins bound to the full-length PKM1. Although the total number of brain proteins bound to the PK peptide was significantly higher than in the case of PKM1, 15 proteins were common for both affinity ligands (Table 3). At least 10 of 15 common proteins are known to exhibit some moonlighting functions (Table 3).\n* Moonlighting proteins are shown in bold. Numbers in the functional group column designate the following protein functions: 1. metabolic enzymes; 2. proteins involved in cytoskeleton formation and trafficking; 3. proteins involved in signal transduction and enzyme activity regulation; 4. protective proteins and components of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system; 5. protein regulators of gene expression, cell division, and differentiation.\nThe commonly identified proteins bound to both the PK peptide and full-length PKM1 were submitted for plotting an interactome map. The resultant map contained 15 nodes and 60 edges in the interactome (Figure 2). The core of the interactions was formed by glycolytic proteins exhibiting moonlighting functions (ALDOA, GAPDH, ENO1, and PKM) and a group of proteins involved in protein folding and chaperoning (HSP90AB1, HSPA8, and NPM1). Results of our study indicate direct interactions between PKM1 and the mouse brain proteins with documented moonlighting functions. These proteins may be relevant for the performance of moonlighting functions of PKM1. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 11"

            "text": "Performance of canonical and moonlighting functions by multifunctional proteins obviously involves different sets of proteins and PPIs. In the case of unknown moonlighting functions of a protein of interest, certain information could be obtained by analyzing its protein partners and PPIs. In the context of putative moonlighting functions, PKM1, an enzyme of adult nonproliferating tissues (skeletal and cardiac musculature, and the brain), is always \u201cin the shadow\u201d of PKM2, expressed by embryonic and adult actively proliferating tissues. Being encoded by a single gene (PKM), PKM1 and PKM2 are formed due to alternative splicing: the alternative exons encode peptide products of the same length, but their identity is about 50% [28]. Moonlighting functions of PKM2 are associated with various cellular processes. Mitogenic and oncogenic stimulation of proliferating cells induces PKM2 translocation into the nucleus [29,30], where it functions as a transcriptional coactivator and a protein kinase phosphorylating histone [31,32]. The moonlighting role of PKM1 is poorly investigated and there are a few examples suggesting that PKM1 could have moonlighting functions in some cells. In this case proteomic profiling with PKM1 as the affinity ligand may help to find putative protein partners for such moonlighting functions. Using highly purified skeletal rabbit PKM1 and the synthetic 32-mer PK peptide as the affinity ligands, we have identified 44 and 92 individual mouse brain proteins, respectively (Tables 1 and 3, and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). PKM has been identified among common mouse brain proteins bound to both affinity sorbents (PKM1 and the PK peptide, Table 3). This suggests functional importance of the interface contact region for interaction of PKM1 with potential protein partners. The higher repertoire of proteins bound to the PK peptide may be explained by the higher conformational accessibility of the peptide interaction sites. Nevertheless, there were common proteins bound to both affinity ligands and formed several groups of functional interactions (Figure 2). PKM1 participates in interactions with proteasome subunits (PSMA6), known glycolytic proteins exhibiting moonlighting functions (ALDOA, GAPDH, and ENO1), and also with proteins involved in protein folding and chaperoning (HSP90AB1, HSPA8, and NPM1). Some of these interactions obviously reflect canonical functions of the glycolytic enzymes supporting proteasomes with additional energy resources and promoting maintenance of nucleotide-dependent functions of proteasomes [33]. The group of proteins involved in protein folding and chaperoning is particularly interesting. It includes several chaperones, HSP90AB1, HSPA8, HSPD1, and NPM1, directly interacting with PKM1. Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is a multifunctional protein, which shuttles between nucleoli, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm and performs its multifaceted roles (see for review [34]). It exhibits histone- and protein-chaperone activity, participates in DNA replication and repair, ribosome assembly and export, and centrosome duplication and cell cycle control [34\u201341]. In nucleoli NPM1 acts as a hub protein, which contributes to nucleolar organization through multiple (heterotypic and homotypic) interactions [34]. The number of NPM1-binding proteins exceeds several dozens, and their list is constantly growing [34]. It is possible that PKM1 interaction with NPM1 and other proteins has a regulatory importance in various cell compartments including the nucleus. Convincing evidence exists in the literature that PKM2, but not PKM1, can move into the nucleus due to the exclusive presence of exon 10, encoding the nuclear localization signal [31,32]. Since the nuclear localization signal is located in the interface contact region, it appears that realization of this scenario requires dissociation of PKM2 tetramers. However, recently it has been demonstrated that under certain conditions PKM1 can also be translocated to the nucleus [42] and therefore interact with potential nuclear targets. Thus, results of this proteomic profiling have shown that, in addition to proteins related to the classical functioning of PKM1, there are other PKM1-binding proteins. These proteins may be relevant to some activities unrelated to the role of PKM1 as an important glycolytic\nenzyme. Since binding capacities obviously involve the PKM1 interface contact region, this suggests an important role of oligomer-to-monomer transition for PKM1 moonlighting."

For determination of proteins nonspecifically bound to the sorbent, a control CNBr-Sepharose was used. It was subjected to the same procedures but without the addition of PKM1. Lysates of brain homogenates (protein concentration of 6 mg/mL) were added to the affinity resin washed with buffer A. The suspension (1:1), containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors added at a concentration recommended by the manufacturer, was incubated overnight at 4 \u25e6C and gentle stirring. The affinity resin was then washed with 100 volumes of buffer A to remove nonspecifically bound proteins (protein content in the washings was controlled by OD280). The remaining proteins were eluted at room temperature with 0.1 M glycine buffer, pH 2.8, containing 3 M NaCl (at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min), using a column 1 cm \u00d7 2 cm. The eluate (30 mL) was concentrated to 0.25 mL using an Amicon Ultra centrifuge device. Proteins were extracted with a mixture of chloroform\u2013methanol [44]. The reduction of disulfide bonds, the alkylation of sulfhydryl groups, and trypsinolysis were performed on Vivaspin 500 centrifuge filters with a 10,000 Da membrane, as described in [44].

A Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source (nESI) was operated in the positive ionization mode with a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200, the ion accumulation volume in the trap was set to 1 \u00d7 106, the ion accumulation time in the trap was maximum 50 ms. The dominant charge state of precursor ions was set as 2+, charge states above 4+ and below 2+ were excluded from further analysis. Scanning of tandem spectra was carried out in the mode of automatic selection of 20 dominant peaks of precursor ions recorded at m/z = 350\u20131400. The resolution for detecting fragment ions was set to 15,000 at m/z 200, the ion accumulation volume in the trap was 1 \u00d7 105, and the ion accumulation time in the trap was a maximum of 50 ms. Parent ions were isolated in a window of 2.0 m/z offset by 0.5 m/z for better isotope capture. Measured precursor ions were excluded from subsequent analysis for 20 s after scanning. The obtained mass spectrometric data with the *.raw extension were processed by the MaxQuant software (v 1.6.3.4) with the built-in Andromeda search algorithm. Mouse (Mus musculus) Swiss Prot/Uniprot complete proteome protein sequence database was downloaded from the Uniprot database with the addition of reversed sequences and commonly encountered contaminating sequences to apply the target decoy approach. The method was used to calculate the FDR (False Discovery Rate) parameter; the FDR parameter of 1% was taken as a cutoff for protein registration. The following parameters were used for signal extraction and its subsequent processing: the proteolytic cleavage enzyme was trypsin; the maximum allowable amount of intrapeptide residues of lysine or arginine was not more than 1; and the allowable error in measuring the monoisotopic mass of the peptide was \u00b10.01 Da, and the allowable error in measuring the fragment ion was \u00b10.05 Da.\nCarbamide methylation of cysteine residues was chosen as a fixed chemical modification, and methionine oxidation was chosen as a variable modification [20]. The relative abundance (quantitation) of the proteins defined as an emPAI value (Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance index) was based on the protein coverage by the peptide matches in a database search result. The obtained proteome was percolated to extract proteins for bioinformatic analysis. The confidence score for these proteins was at least 95%. Each protein presented in the tables was identified in at least three independent experiments with a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value cut-off of 0.001 (raw p-value cut-off 0.01).

            "text": "The affinity-based proteomic profiling of mouse brain proteins, performed by using highly purified PKM1 as the affinity ligand, resulted in the identification of 44 PKM1binding proteins. Since one of the identified proteins was PKM, the immobilized affinity ligand, purified rabbit muscle PKM1, was functionally competent to form PKM oligomers. This suggests involvement of the interface contact region in the interaction with PKM binding proteins. The use of the 32-mer peptide (PK peptide) significantly increased the repertoire of brain proteins bound to this affinity ligand. Nevertheless, there were 15 common proteins bound to both PKM1 and the PK peptide. These common proteins form a protein\nnetwork (interactome) and some interactions especially with proteins involved in protein folding and chaperoning are relevant for moonlighting functions of PKM1.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24087634/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.M. and O.B.; proteomic profiling O.B., A.K., and V.Z.; enzyme purification and characterization, M.M.; bioinformatic analysis, A.K. and A.V.; SPR-based validation, O.G., A.I., and O.B., data analysis, O.B., A.K., and A.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.M.
