    "abstractText": "Hepsin, a cell surface serine protease, is a potential biomarker for the detection of prostate cancer due to its high expression in prostate cancer but not in normal prostate. This study aimed to develop a radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of hepsin. Six leucine\u2013arginine (Leu\u2013Arg) dipeptide derivatives (two diastereomers for each of three ligands) were synthesized and evaluated for their binding affinities and selectivity for hepsin. Based on the binding assay, a natCu-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N\u2032,N\",N\u201d\u2019-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-conjugated ligand (3B) was selected for the development of a PET radioligand. [64Cu]3B was synthesized by labeling the DOTA-conjugated compound 11B with [Cu]CuCl2 at 80 \u25e6 C for 20 min. The radioligand was evaluated for prostate cancer cell binding and PET imaging in a prostate tumor mouse model. The results demonstrated that [64Cu]3B exhibited high binding to LNCaP cells, intermediate binding to 22Rv1 cells, and low binding to PC3 cells. PET studies of [64Cu]3B in mice, implanted with 22Rv1 and PC3 cells on each flank, revealed that the radioligand uptake was high and persistent in the 22Rv1 tumors over time, whereas it was low in PC3 tumors. The results of this study suggest that [64Cu]3B is a promising PET radioligand for hepsin imaging.",

In the United States, prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men [2]. Prostate cancer that is still confined within the organ can be treated by surgery and radiation therapy [3]. However, metastasis of this cancer into other organs may increase the mortality rate [4]. Therefore, early detection of prostate cancer is essential for an improved prognosis after therapy. The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is widely used for the early screening of prostate cancer [5]. However, the serum PSA levels are not specific for prostate cancer, because PSA is expressed not only in prostate cancer but also in the normal prostate. This makes discrimination between normal prostate or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer challenging [6]. Therefore, specific molecular biomarkers for prostate cancer are required for early and accurate diagnosis of the disease. Hepsin is a type II transmembrane serine protease composed of 413 amino acids. Tissue microarray-based expression profiling demonstrated that hepsin expression was upregulated in prostate cancer specimens, but low or no hepsin expression was detected in normal prostate and BPH specimens [7\u201311]. Additionally, increased expression of hepsin\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1109. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15091109 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1109 2 of 14\nhas been observed in metastatic tumors compared to primary tumors [7,11]. Moreover, the crystal structure of soluble human hepsin exhibits that two domains are located extracellularly and that the larger domain contains the active site cleft for the binding of hepsin inhibitors [12]. These characteristics render hepsin a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Over the past few decades, ligands have been specifically developed for molecular imaging of hepsin. Hepsin-binding peptides with high affinity (190 nM) and selectivity were identified using phage display [13]. When analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, multiple FITC-peptides conjugated to fluorescent nanoparticles (Cy5.5) (IPL-NP) exhibit a markedly increased signal in hepsin-expressing prostate cancer cells compared with the monomeric FITC-peptide. Using fluorescence-mediated tomography, small tumors were detected in mice injected with IPL-NP and its accumulation was 2.8-fold higher in hepsin-positive LNCaP tumors than in hepsin-negative PC3 tumors. In another study, a heterobivalent ligand, targeting both hepsin and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), was synthesized. Its SulfoCy7-conjugated version was evaluated in vitro and in vivo [14]. The ligand displayed inhibitory activities for hepsin (IC50 = 2.8 \u00b5M) and PSMA (IC50 = 28 nM). The near-infrared (NIR) images of mice showed significantly stronger signals in PC3/ML\u2013PSMA\u2013hepsin tumors than in low hepsin expressing PC3/ML tumors [14]. Moreover, stronger signals were observed in PC3/ML\u2013PSMA\u2013hepsin tumors compared to those in PC3/ML\u2013PSMA tumors. More recently, BODIPY- and SulfoCy7-conjugated Leu\u2013Arg dipeptide derivatives were developed for the NIR imaging of hepsin [15]. Despite their high binding affinities for hepsin (Ki = 21 and 22 nM), the ligands were not evaluated for NIR imaging. As such, small molecule hepsin inhibitors have been developed for optical imaging. However, none have been applied to PET imaging so far. In the present study, we developed a PET radioligand that was derived from a Leu\u2013Arg dipeptide-based hepsin inhibitor [15]. We synthesized six Leu\u2013Arg dipeptide derivatives (two diastereomers for each of three ligands) (Figure 1): fluorine-substituted ligands (1A and 1B), natGa-DOTA-conjugated ligands (2A and 2B), and natCu-DOTA-conjugated ligands (3A and 3B). Based on our findings with respect to the binding affinity and selectivity for hepsin, 3B was selected for radiolabeling.

Radiochemical synthesis of [64Cu]3B which involved the incorporation of 64Cu into the DOTA-conjugated compound (11B) was straightforward (Scheme 2). However, a small quantity of [64Cu]3A was also formed, even though the HPLC-purified 11B was used for radiolabeling. Therefore, [64Cu]3B was purified by HPLC. The desired HPLC fraction was collected; however, the removal of the HPLC solvents at 80 \u25e6C under a gentle stream of N2 was time-consuming. Although this procedure could be improved by using solidphase extraction cartridges, the water-solubility of the product would hamper the use of cartridges. We performed in vitro and in vivo characterization of [64Cu]3B using prostate cancer cells and a prostate tumor mouse model. LNCaP and PC3 cells were selected as the high and low hepsin expressing cell lines [13,24]. The 22Rv1 cell line was included in this study. The cell binding of [64Cu]3B was high in LNCaP cells, intermediate in 22Rv1 cells, and lowest in PC3 cells (Figure 3A). Blocking of cell binding using 3B resulted in 45.7\u201350.5% inhibition in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells (*** p) at 6 h, but only a 23.9% inhibition in PC3 cells (Figure 3B). The results revealed the hepsin level in the 22Rv1 cells, which was higher than in the PC3 but lower than in the LNCaP cells, and the specificity of [64Cu]3B for hepsin. Early detection of tumors is clinically important [13]. Therefore, we conducted PET imaging studies on small tumors in mice that were implanted with PC3 cells on the left flank and 22Rv1 cells on the right flank (Figure 4A). The 22Rv1 cells lines were selected for the mouse tumor model owing to their fast growth rate and high self-blocking levels as compared to LNCaP cell lines. (Figure 3). In contrast, the PC3 was selected as the low hepsin-expressing cell lines. Based on the ROI analysis of tumor PET images, the radioligand uptake at 17 h after injection was two-fold higher in 22Rv1 tumors than that in PC3 tumors (Figure 4B). Moreover, the radioligand uptake in 22Rv1 tumors increased over time, whereas the uptake in PC3 tumors decreased, suggesting that tumor uptake was due to the specific binding of [64Cu]3B to hepsin. In this study, the radioligand was evaluated in mice implanted with two cell lines displaying varying levels of hepsin (Figure 3). However, in vivo blocking studies may be needed to further support the hepsin specificity of [64Cu]3B in vivo. An in vitro serum stability study showed that the [64Cu]3B was slowly epimerized to the corresponding A isomer when incubated with FBS at 37 \u25e6C (Figure 2). Although the observed in vitro serum stability of the radioligands may not always reflect their in vivo stability, this in vitro study is widely used for predicting in vivo stability of radioligands. In this study, PET images were acquired at 1, 14, and 17 h after radioligand injection. Based on the in vitro serum stability study findings, the PET images obtained at 17 h could be attributed to the radioligand that was comprised of [64Cu]3B (higher than 70.3%) and [64Cu]3A (less than 23.9%) (Figure 2). The PET images acquired within a few hours using a radioligand with a shorter half-life will reveal an uptake only by [64Cu]3B in vivo. Although further studies are warranted to investigate the in vivo epimerization of the [64Cu]3B to the [64Cu]3A, the [64Cu]3B was mostly detected during the entire duration of the in vitro stability study. Furthermore, both 3A and 3B were found to be potent hepsin inhibitors (Table 1). Alternatively, a diastereomeric mixture of [64Cu]3A and [64Cu]3B can be used for hepsin imaging. Most of the reported hepsin inhibitors exhibit high binding affinities but relatively low selectivity for hepsin over matriptase and other proteases [15,23,25\u201330]. The ligands developed in this study exhibited superior binding affinities with a moderate selectivity for hepsin (Table 1). To this end, the development of radioligands with both higher binding affinities and selectivity for hepsin is required, thus allowing for their improved uptake in hepsin-expressing prostate tumors.\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1109 8 of 14"

The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 \u25e6C for 20 min. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with water. It was then purified by HPLC equipped with a semi-preparative column using an 80:20 mixture of 0.1% TFA\u2013water and 0.1% TFA\u2013acetonitrile at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The desired product was eluted between 21.8 and 22.6 min and the HPLC solvents were removed under a gentle stream of N2 at 80 \u25e6C. The radioligand was re-dissolved in saline for in vitro and in vivo studies. The molar activity was determined by comparing the UV peak area of the desired radioactive peak and those of the various concentrations of non-radioactive ligand using HPLC. This was performed using an analytical column eluted with a 75:25 mixture of water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% TFA, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The identity of [64Cu]3B was determined by co-injecting the radioligand and the corresponding nonradioactive ligand into the HPLC system."

MicroPET images were acquired for 10 min at 1, 14, and 17 h after intravenous injection of [64Cu]3B (8.14 \u00b1 0.06 MBq) into mice (n = 3) via the tail vein when tumor volumes had reached 119.3 \u00b1 26.5 mm3 (PC3) and 147.0 \u00b1 37.0 mm3 (22Rv1). The images were reconstructed using the three-dimensional ordered subset expectation maximization and then processed using Siemens Inveon Research Workplace 4.2. ROIs were drawn over the tumors in the left and right flanks and other major tissues, and the average signal levels in the ROIs were measured. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3).\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1109 13 of 14"

In vitro cell binding study and in vivo characterization of the radioligand in mice, implanted with two prostate cancer cell lines displaying varying levels of hepsin, showed that [64Cu]3B exhibits desirable characteristics for PET imaging of hepsin. This is the first PET radioligand for hepsin imaging, and our study can be used as a foundation to further develop and refine radioligands for hepsin imaging.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ph15091109/s1, Analysis data of ligands (NMR) and radioligand (HPLC); Figure S1: IC50 curves; Figure S2: In vitro serum stability of [64Cu]3B.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.S.C.; methodology, Y.S.C., J.-H.P. and J.Y.K.; formal analysis, J.-H.P. and X.Z.; binding assay, H.H. and Y.B.; investigation, J.-H.P. and X.Z.; resources, Y.S.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.S.C. and J.-H.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.S.C.; supervision, Y.S.C., J.Y.C. and K.-H.L.; funding acquisition, Y.S.C.
