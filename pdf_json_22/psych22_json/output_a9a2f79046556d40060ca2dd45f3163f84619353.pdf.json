    "abstractText": "Since the retina shares its embryological origin with the central nervous system, optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging technique frequently employed in ophthalmology to analyze the macula and intraretinal layer thicknesses and volumes, has recently become increasingly important in psychiatric research. We examined 34 autistic and 31 neurotypical adults (NT) using OCT. Autistic adults had reduced overall macular and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness and volume compared to NT. Both macular and ONL thickness showed significant inverse associations with the severity of autistic symptoms measured with the Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2). Longitudinal studies across different age groups are required to clarify whether retinal changes may represent a possible trait marker.",

The underlying etiology is\nstill unknown, with a strong genetic component, environmental and neurobiological factors as well as brain developmental alterations appearing to be involved (Lord et\u00a0al., 2018; Pardo & Eberhart, 2007). Neuroimaging studies in ASD point towards an altered trajectory of brain maturation\n* Kathrin Nickel kathrin.nickel@uniklinik-freiburg.de\nEvelyn B. N.

Hox genes are important in the molecular control of early morphogenesis (Gokhale & Gokhale, 2007) and were suggested to be involved in the central nervous system (CNS) development with the HOXA1 A218G polymorphism being associated with an enlarged cranial circumference in autism (Conciatori et\u00a0al., 2004; Hashem et\u00a0al., 2020). The retina and optic nerve share their neuroectodermal embryological origin with the brain, and are regarded as part of the CNS (Chua et\u00a0al., 2021; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2017). Moreover, the thickness and volume of the intraretinal layers were found to be associated with total brain, gray and white matter volume (Chua et\u00a0al., 2021; Mauschitz et\u00a0al., 2022). Therefore, optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a non-invasive in\u00a0vivo ophthalmologic routine examination method (Huang et\u00a0al., 1991) is considered an innovative tool to investigate potential retinal alterations in autistic adults (Little, 2018; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2017; Silverstein et\u00a0al., 2020) and can be regarded as a \u201cwindow to the brain\u201d (Sch\u00f6nfeldtLecuona et\u00a0al., 2015).\nOCT is a high-resolution imaging technique that relies on interference between the signal of an examined object and a local reference signal (Podoleanu, 2012) providing high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina (Bagci et\u00a0al., 2008). OCT has gained increasing importance in the examination of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (Noval et\u00a0al., 2011), Parkinson's and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Chan et\u00a0al., 2019; Jindahra et\u00a0al., 2010). In Alzheimer\u2019s disease, for example, a thinner retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) was associated with an increased risk of dementia (Mutlu et\u00a0al., 2018) and discussed as a possible correlate which might provide information on neurodegeneration of the brain (Mutlu et\u00a0al., 2017). Therefore, OCT has also become a focus of psychiatric research, particularly in the investigation of patients with schizophrenia (Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2017; Silverstein et\u00a0al., 2020).\nStudies investigating autistic adults applying OCT, however, are rare. Emberti Gialloreti et\u00a0al. (2014) performed OCT examinations in 24 adults with ASD (11 with high functioning autism (HFA), 13 with Asperger Syndrome (AS)) compared to 24 neurotypical adults (NT). Autistic adults showed reduced thickness of the nasal peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) compared to NT. When dividing the ASD group into HFA and AS subsamples, the\u00a0HFA group\u00a0exhibited reduced global pRNFL thickness as well as nasal and inferior pRNFL thinning compared to NT, while the AS group showed only reduced nasal pRNFL thickness compared to NT. In contrast, Garc\u00eda-Medina et\u00a0al. (2017) reported a significantly thicker total retina (sum of all layers from the RNFL to the photoreceptors (PR)) and total inner retina (sum of all layers from the RNFL to the\ninner nuclear layer (INL)) at the fovea, as well as a significantly increased inferior pRNFL thickness in 27 children and young adolescents with high-functioning ASD compared to 27 NT. Additionally, they described a trend level elevated inner plexiform layer (IPL) and INL thickness at the fovea and trends of a thicker mean macular thickness (mean thickness of all 9 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) sectors) of the total and inner retina for the autistic adults (Garc\u00eda-Medina et\u00a0al., 2017). They suggested that the increased retinal thickness in ASD might result from parenchyma overgrowth (Bigler et\u00a0al., 2010) or be related to neuroinflammatory processes such as microglia activation (Garc\u00eda-Medina et\u00a0al., 2017; Nakagawa & Chiba, 2016). Additionally, a positive association between the inferior pRNFL thickness and the composite intelligence quotient (IQ) was detected (Garc\u00eda-Medina et\u00a0al., 2017). A recent study (Garcia-Medina et\u00a0al., 2020) reported higher optic nerve head (ONH) perfusion density and lower ONH flux at the peripapillary inferior quadrant in 13 autistic adolescents and young adults compared to NT, while the increase in the mean macular and inferior pRNFL thickness in autistic participants remained on trend level."

Based on previous studies, we expected an atypical formation of the pRNFL. Due to inconclusive results of preceding investigations, we wanted to clarify whether the pRNFL is thicker, thinner, or unaltered in autistic adults compared to NT. Moreover, we aimed to compare the structural features of the circumfoveal intraretinal layers (RNFL, ganglion cell layer (GCL), IPL, INL, outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor-retinal pigment epithelium (PR + RPE) complex) as well as the overall macular thickness (MT) and volume (MV) between autistic and neurotypical adults. Additionally, we aimed at determining whether there is an association between retinal alterations and the severity of autistic symptoms."

The diagnostic assessment included the autism spectrum quotient (AQ) (Baron-Cohen et\u00a0al., 2001), the empathy quotient (EQ) (Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2004) and the Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2) (Constantino, 2012), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) (Beck et\u00a0al., 1996; Hautzinger et\u00a0al., 2006) to evaluate comorbid depressive symptoms, the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURSk) (Retz-Junginger et\u00a0al., 2002) for the investigation of comorbid symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood as well as the Multiple Choice Vocabulary Test (MWT-B) (Lehrl et\u00a0al., 1995) as measure for crystallized intelligence. The autistic adults overlap with participants who have already been assessed for functional retinal changes using the electroretinogram (ERG) (Friedel et\u00a0al., 2022b).\nThirty-one NT matched according to sex and age were additionally enrolled in the study. The NT participants had to be without a current or past history of a psychiatric illness. The following questionnaires were collected: the Structured Clinical Interview SCID-I (Wittchen et\u00a0al., 1997) to rule out axis I psychiatric diseases according to DSM-IV criteria, the SCID-II (Fydrich et\u00a0al., 1997) to additionally rule out axis II personality disorders, the AQ (Baron-Cohen et\u00a0al., 2001), EQ (Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2004) and SRS-2 (Constantino, 2012) questionnaire to rule out symptoms of an ASD, the BDI-II (Beck et\u00a0al., 1996; Hautzinger et\u00a0al., 2006) questionnaire to exclude a current depressive episode, the WURS-k (Retz-Junginger et\u00a0al., 2002) to rule out ADHD symptoms in childhood as well as the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90) (Derogatis & Savitz, 1999) questionnaire. Moreover, the NT participants completed the MWT-B (Lehrl et\u00a0al., 1995) questionnaire to assess the IQ.\nThe following exclusion criteria were defined for all study participants: ophthalmological diseases (with the exception of correctable refraction errors), low visual acuity (< 0.7 decimal visual acuity; measured with the Freiburg Acuity and Contrast Test (Bach, 2007)), myopia lower than \u2212 6 dpt or hyperopia greater than + 6 dpt (Cruz-Herranz et\u00a0al., 2016), ocular surgery, neurological disorders, diabetes mellitus or arterial hypertension, substance abuse, age < 18\u00a0years or > 65\u00a0years, bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms, and insufficient collaboration during OCT imaging."

When available, data from both eyes were averaged for all participants. If one eye had to be excluded, only the other eye was considered in the analysis.\nSince some of the partial datasets showed outliers and slight departures from the normal distribution, robust multiple linear regression models (function \u201clmrob\u201d; package \u201crobustbase\u201d (Maechler et\u00a0al., 2021)) were used to\n1 3\nestimate differences in OCT measures between NT and autistic adults while controlling for age and sex.

Age values were mean centred, and male NT were defined as reference (\n0 ). The regression coefficients for group affili-\nation (\u03b2group) thus directly indicate the robustly estimated differences of group means after adjusting for age and sex.

(2017) showed greater thickness of the total retina (equivalent to the MT) and the total inner retina (comprising the RNFL, GCL, IPL, INL) at the fovea as well as an elevated inferior pRNFL thickness in ASD. Additionally, the inferior pRNFL thickness was positively associated with the composite IQ of autistic adults (Garc\u00eda-Medina et\u00a0al., 2017).\nThe different observations may be due to the fact that the preceding study examined autistic children and adolescents (Garc\u00eda-Medina et\u00a0al., 2017), while we focused on adults. The retinal thickening in children (Garc\u00eda-Medina et\u00a0al., 2017), trends towards an elevated MT and pRNFL thickness in adolescents and young adults with ASD (Garcia-Medina et\u00a0al., 2020) and the finding of retinal thinning in adults with ASD in our and a preceding study (Emberti Gialloreti et\u00a0al., 2014) might complement observations from neuroimaging studies. While there is consensus on early brain overgrowth during infancy (Ecker et\u00a0al., 2015; Hazlett et\u00a0al., 2011; Prigge et\u00a0al., 2021) followed by an arrested growth and normalization in brain volume from adolescence to late middle age (Courchesne et\u00a0al., 2011; Ecker et\u00a0al., 2015; Prigge et\u00a0al., 2021), alterations in cerebral structures in adulthood in ASD are under debate. Although some studies pointed towards a reduced brain volume in autistic adults (Courchesne et\u00a0al., 2011; Ecker et\u00a0al., 2015), others reported normal brain (Denier et\u00a0al., 2022; Riedel et\u00a0al., 2014) and gray matter (Prigge et\u00a0al., 2021) volumes as well as an unaltered cortical thickness in autistic adults with ASD (Maier et\u00a0al., 2018). Likewise, we found no reductions in the pRNFL, RNFL, GCL, IPL, INL, OPL and PR + RPE, which were reported to be positively associated with the total brain, the total gray and white matter volumes (Mauschitz et\u00a0al., 2022). The thickness of the ONL \u2013comprising the cell bodies of the photoreceptors, representing the first step in the retinal afferent path\u2013 seemed not to be correlated with any of these cerebral structures (Mauschitz et\u00a0al., 2022). The reasons for the retinal alterations observed in adults with ASD, however, have not yet been clarified or directly compared to brain imaging data. As potential underlying correlates, neuroinflammatory processes (Nakagawa & Chiba, 2016) or a modification in the programmed cell death (Wei et\u00a0al., 2014) within the retina have been discussed.\nIt has to be stressed that assumptions with respect to the precise link between retinal and global neuronal network abnormalities in ASD remain speculative. One could speculate that the volume loss of the retinal ONL is due to migratory or other neurodevelopmental network perturbations that reflect synchronously occurring neurodevelopmental perturbations in isocortical networks.\nAlternatively, the ONL abnormalities could reflect a shift in GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling in ASD, as postulated by the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance hypothesis\n(E/I imbalance hypothesis), given that both neurotransmitters also play a central role at a retinal level (Rubenstein & Merzenich, 2003; Tebartz van Elst et\u00a0al., 2014). In this framework, the retina was examined in a prenatally exposed valproic acid autism mouse model in a previous study (Guimar\u00e3es-Souza et\u00a0al., 2019), because sensoric hypo-/hypersensitivity to visual stimuli is a well known phenomenon in ASD. The retina, as part of the CNS, mainly uses GABA and glutamate to modulate and transmit visual signals (Wu, 2010). Guimar\u00e3es-Souza et\u00a0al. (2019) detected reduced GABA expression and increased mGluR5 in the retinas of early adolescent mice prenatally exposed to valproic acid (Guimar\u00e3es-Souza et\u00a0al., 2019), a finding that relates well to the proposed E/I imbalance hypothesis of ASD (Rubenstein & Merzenich, 2003).\nWhile we detected structural retinal alterations of the ONL and MT, we found no functional retinal changes in an ERG study in an overlapping sample of autistic adults (Friedel et\u00a0al., 2022b). However, how and whether functional and structural retinal changes are associated and related to the E/I imbalance hypothesis needs to be further investigated in combined ophthalmologic and neuroimaging studies in the future.\nWe detected a significant inverse correlation between the severity of ASD-related symptoms and presence of social impairment, measured by the total SRS-2 score (Constantino, 2012), and the thickness and volume of the ONL. Based on these association, future longitudinal studies should investigate whether alterations in retinal layer thickness could represent a suitable biomarker for ASD. It remains to be clarified how the thickness of the ONL develops during the course of the disorder, and whether it might represent a state\u00a0or a possible trait marker."

            "text": "The cross-sectional design of our study does not allow conclusions on whether the detected alterations in the ONL represent a state or a trait marker. The results require replication in a larger sample, however, the current study examined a comparable number of autistic adults using OCT as previous studies. Based on the psychometric assessments, autistic adults had significantly elevated symptoms of depression and ADHD in childhood when compared to NT, a potential source of bias. However, the reduction in the MT and ONL thickness and volume was also significant in the subsample of autistic adults without elevated scores of ADHD related symptoms in childhood. Likewise, the MT, MV and ONL thickness reduction was also detected in the ASD subgroup without depressive symptoms.\nAlthough possible confounding effects of psychiatric medication cannot be ruled out, the analysis of the ASD subsample without psychiatric medication revealed, that all\n1 3\npreviously observed reductions in the MV, MT and ONL thickness and volume were also apparent in unmedicated autistic adults. Therefore, it is unlikely that the retinal thinning is due to a medication effect."

            "text": "Retinal layer thicknesses and volumes in thirty-four autistic adults and thirty-one NT\u00a0adults were investigated and compared with OCT. We detected a reduction of the total MT, MV as well as of the total ONL thickness and volume. Macular thinning was restricted to the para- and perifoveal region, whereas ONL thinning was observed in all regions (fovea, peri- and parafovea) in autistic adults.\nFurther studies are required to clarify whether these structural retinal alterations are already evident in early childhood or manifest during the course of the disease. To gain a more comprehensive picture of ASD, future investigations may evaluate how retinal and cerebral alterations are interconnected, whether the structural deficits of the retina are associated with atypical retinal functioning and how other parameters such as\u00a0medication intake may play a role. It would be desirable to analyze a larger sample of autistic adults across different age spans and additionally include a larger cohort of medication na\u00efve participants.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10803- 022- 05882-8.\nAcknowledgments Not applicable.\nAuthor Contributions KN and EF wrote the paper.
