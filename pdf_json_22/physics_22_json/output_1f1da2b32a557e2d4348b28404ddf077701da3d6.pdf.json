    "abstractText": "A new type of low-pass filter based on a leaky coaxial waveguide is presented. The filter has minimal insertion loss in the pass band, while at the same time high attenuation in the stop band is achieved. Thanks to its arrangement, the filter does not present parasitic leakage paths, so that, unlike conventional resonant filters, the stop band extends to very high frequencies. It is shown that a particular stop-band attenuation can be obtained by adding or removing leaking sections. Coupling between the center coaxial structure and the leaking holes is investigated. A prototype is manufactured and scattering parameters are measured up to 145 GHz. The prototype shows an insertion loss of less than 0.15 dB up to 10 GHz and an attenuation in excess of 60 dB above 70 GHz. The proposed filter is suitable for superconducting quantum computing applications where qubits are sensitive to radiation with energy high enough to break Cooper-pairs, thereby destroying superconductivity.",

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION Superconducting (SC) circuits using Josephson junctions to realize quantum bits (qubits) are a promising architecture for quantum computing (QC) [9], [14]. These devices are cooled to low temperatures (about 10 mK) to reduce thermal interference that can destroy superconductivity and interfere with qubit operations [12], [13]. Control electronics is placed at room-temperature and microwave signals are guided into successively cooler regions. At each temperature stage, the signal is attenuated to reduce thermally generated noise from higher temperature stages.\nSC qubits are peculiar in that they are not only sensitive to radiation in-band or radiation close to in-band frequencies (SC qubits are commonly design to operate between 1 and 10 GHz) [15]. They are also sensitive to very highfrequency radiation, even at extremely low power levels [8], [11]. The reason for this is quantum mechanical: photons with energy high enough to break Cooper pairs can destroy superconductivity [5]. Cooper-pair breaking takes place when the frequency of the incident radiation exceeds 2\u2206~ , where \u2206 is the superconducting energy gap and ~ is Planck\u2019s constant. Different materials and configurations have different energy gaps \u2206, but common materials and film thicknesses used in superconducting quantum computing have energy gaps corresponding to frequencies in the range of tens of GHz up to a few THz. For example, in Al, the most common material used to realize Josephson junctions, the threshold frequency for Cooper-pair breaking is around 80 GHz. At the lowest temperature-stage, various filtering strategies have been\nDepartment of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, Go\u0308teborg, Sweden\nCoresponding author: Robert Rehammar, robert.rehammar@chalmers.se Manuscript received Month xx, 2022; revised Month xx, 2022.\nimplemented to remove any stray radiation, briefly reviewed below. On output lines, circulators are used to block radiation from back-propagating from the high-temperature stages to the cold regions. A typical measurement setup is sketched in figure 1.\nDesigning filters that are transparent at low frequency (1 \u2013 10 GHz) and highly attenuating at very high frequencies (& 60 GHz) is a non-trivial task. This type of filters are generally denoted infrared (IR) blocking filters in the QC community. A simple LC-filter with discrete components has a transfer function\nf(\u03c9) = 1\n1\u2212 \u03c92LC .\nHowever, the expression assumes ideal components. In reality, this type of filter will start leaking at some high-enough frequency due to parasitic elements in the components. Thus, other solutions have been utilized in QC set-ups. A common approach is to use coaxial lines filled with some attenuating dielectric such as Eccosorb [6], [7], [17], or copper-powderfilled epoxy [2]. These filters are simple to manufacture and are highly attenuating at high frequencies. However, they have the drawback that they are also attenuating in-band frequencies. In addition, the attenuation is frequency dependent and increasing with increasing frequency. This can lead, among others, to undesired pulse distortion effects, which can cause errors when applying fast pulses to perform qubit gates [18].\nIn this paper, an alternative design for a low-pass filter, based on a leaky coaxial waveguide, is proposed, which we\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n03 94\n1v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n8 M\nay 2\n02 2\n2\nnamed High-Energy Radiation Drain (HERD). HERD has excellent in-band performance, while at the same time, being highly attenuating at high frequencies.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows: Section II describes the design of the filter, Section III reports on measurement and simulation results, and Section IV concludes the paper."

Figure 2 illustrates the prototype investigated in this paper and figure 3 shows parametric dimensions and coordinate systems used. A section is defined as a set of 2 \u00d7 4 hollow waveguide (HW) apertures placed tangentially on the eight faces in two consecutive circles. M is used to denote the number of sections and M = 4 in the prototype depicted in Figure 2. The total number of HW is denoted N and N = 8 \u00d7 M . On the prototype and in all simulated design variants reported in this paper, the HW are placed in a regular lattice on the coax outer body. This is purely for design and manufacturing simplification. To achieve the desired performance, the design of HERD does not rely on resonant phenomena or interference effects. Actually it is probably so that a non-periodic design might perform better, but that has not been investigated in this work.\nThe coaxial ports are the main waveguiding ports and they are terminated by SMA connectors. The characteristic impedance of a simple cylindrical coaxial transmission line is [4]\nZ0 = 1\n2\u03c0\n\u221a \u00b5\n\u03b5 ln ( ro ri ) ' 377 \u2126 2\u03c0 ln ( r0 ri )\nwhere the last equality is obtained from assuming air as the dielectric. By setting Z0 = 50 \u2126 with an air-filled dielectric\nro ri \u223c 2.302 . (1)\nThe cutoff frequency of the leaking apertures is set by the aperture cross-section and the dielectric constant of the material filling the cross-section. For a rectangular HW, the cutoff wavenumber is [3]\nk2c,mn = 1\n\u03b5\u00b5 [(m\u03c0 a )2 + (n\u03c0 b )2] and the propagation constant is\n\u03932mn = k 2 c,mn \u2212 k20 ,\nwhere a and b are waveguide cross section dimensions, m, n are integer mode numbers, and k0 is the free-space wavenumber satisfying k20 = \u03c9\n2\u03b5\u00b5. To achieve a particular radial width, a, of the leaking apertures, it is required to have a large enough outer radius, ro, of the coaxial structure. At the same time, it is important to keep the coaxial line operating in single mode for in-band frequencies. A higher-order mode can start propagating when [1]\n\u03bb ' \u03c0(ro + ri) .

Other parameters of the geometry are fixed according to Table I.\nlarger HW apertures couple stronger. To improve coupling, the HW apertures can be made electrically larger by filling them with a dielectric with \u03b5 > \u03b50. In this work, PTFE with \u03b5 ' 2.2 was used. The effect of filling the apertures can also be understood by considering that at higher frequencies, more radiation leaks through the apertures so that a larger insertion loss is observed. Increasing the electrical size of the HW can thus be assumed to have a similar effect.\nThe dependence of insertion loss on aperture dimensions a and b was investigated using finite element method (FEM) simulations of the structure. The results are depicted in Figure 4. A very low, flat insertion loss is observed below a certain corner frequency. It can be seen that the corner frequency only depends on the width of the apertures, thus indicating that the excited mode in the HW apertures is of TEm0-type, at least in the lower frequency range. At higher frequencies, both the coaxial and HW structures are overmoded and can be expected to support complex superpositions of many modes. The irregular ripples seen in the insertion loss is expected to come from this fact. No effort is made to understand the exact nature of those modes and how they couple."

As for dielectric losses, PTFE, used in the prototype as dielectric, has very low loss (loss tangent < 0.0004, [10]) and is mostly not participating in transmission attenuation since it does not fill the coaxial structure.\nThe aperture HW needs to have a sufficient depth to stop low-frequency (in-band) radiation from tunneling through the apertures. Below cutoff, the field amplitude is attenuated according to\nF (d) = e\u2212\u03b3d\nwhere\n\u03b3 = \u221a(m\u03c0 a )2 + (n\u03c0 b )2 \u2212 \u03c92/c2\nwhere m,n is the mode number, a, b are aperture dimensions as defined in Figure 3 and c speed of light in the medium. The lowest-order mode is attenuated the most and it is assumed that the TE m, n = 0, 1 mode couples strongest to the TEM mode of the center waveguide as indicated by the above analysis. A simple loss model where loss is additive in the number of apertures is\nT = ( 1\u2212 |F |2 )M (3)\nwhere M is the number of apertures (Note, M = 8 \u00d7 N ). The transmission, T , for a filter with parameters according to table I is plotted in Figure 5. It can be seen that in-band insertion loss can be dominated by leakage through the HW apertures, depending on their parameters. There is a trade-off between HERD size and HW depth that is application dependent since a larger aperture depth, d improves performance at the expense of filter size. This analysis shows that the aperture geometry needs to be engineered properly to achieve desired performance."

The metal is modeled as a perfect electric conductor. In the simulation model, the apertures are terminated by scattering boundary conditions to make the simulations more efficient. In the manufactures prototype, the HW\u2019s are terminated by an absorbing foam or open air. The exact details of the termination have small effects on the filter performance as long as it is sufficiently attenuating. The results can be found in Figure 6 (solid lines). Around 80 and 100 GHz in the simulation model the attenuation is much reduced. These features are not present in the measured prototype. They are ascribed to the scattering boundary conditions of the HW in the simulation.\nFigure 7 (solid lines) shows simulation results on how attenuation through the filter scales with the number of sections for a set of frequencies. It can be seen that a particular attenuation can be achieved by adding sections until sufficient attenuation is achieved. For high frequencies, the attenuation is not monotonic in the number of sections. That is an indication of the complex electromagnetic environment at such high frequencies."

A basic through calibration was performed using a 2.9-2.9 mm adapter connected to the 2.9 mm ports. The primary interest for this measurement is in the high-frequency attenuation of the filter. From the basic calibration procedure, the phase of the scattering parameters cannot be measured, but its measurement is inessential to the characterization of the filter performance in the stop band anyway.\nMeasurement and simulation results over the full 145 GHz span are depicted in figure 6. A very good agreement is found between simulation and measurement except for the return loss, which is lower in the prototype. This is ascribed to the connectors which are not included in the simulation.\nThe in-band performance of the filter is also of interest\n5 and was measured using a conventional VNA procedure and calibration. The results from the measurement can be found in figure 8. The measured insertion loss is below 0.15dB up to 12 GHz and the ripples are well below 0.1dB in the 4-8 GHz band typically used for SC qubits."

            "text": "In this paper, a new type of low-pass filter, named HERD, was presented in which coupling between a coaxial transmission line and apertures in the outer conductor is used to achieve attenuation above cutoff of the apertures. It was shown that a filter consisting of 4 sections and an outer radius ro = 3.65 mm of the coaxial transmission line can provide over 60 dB of attenuation above 70 GHz while at the same time providing very small insertion loss below 10 GHz. Measurement results of a prototype filter up to 145 GHz were presented, in good agreement with FEM simulations. To the authors knowledge, it is the first time such high-frequency measurements are presented on IR blocking filters for QC applications. It is worth noting that the filter stays reasonably matched all that way to 145 GHz, despite that the coaxial structure is highly overmoded at these frequencies.\nThe presented design can be further optimized and tailored to specific applications. Attenuation can be increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing the number of leaking sections. Several design parameters, such as number or sections and aperture shape, can be modified to improve performance. One example of a design improvement that was not investigated in this work is to shape the apertures as ridged waveguides. That can be expected to increase the bandwidth of the aperture and at the same time increase cutoff of some higher-order modes. In the prototype investigated in this work, HW apertures were arranged in a regular lattice along the coax transmission line. Possible resonances due to this periodicity were not investigated and might have degraded performance at specific frequencies. If required, excellent isolation and a steeper roll-off at frequencies intermediate between the passband and the stopband can be straightforwardly achieved by combining the presented filter with commercial, cascaded LC filters.\nThe authors expect HERD to find wide use in cryogenic setups for quantum computing applications, where high rejection of infrared radiation in the 100 GHz range is required. The extremely low insertion loss in the passband makes the filter amenable to be used as an isolation element between the devices under test and the first amplifier in the qubit readout chain. The very low ripples in the passband (less than 0.15dB over 10 GHz) make it also a competitive choice for all types qubit drive lines, in which absorptive filters are typically employed, especially when high-bandwidth, lowdistortion pulses are required to execute qubit gates with high fidelity.\nThe filter is patent pending."
