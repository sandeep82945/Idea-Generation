1. **Extending the results to more general learning models.** The paper focuses on no-regret and no-swap-regret learning models, but it would be interesting to see how the results generalize to other learning models, such as reinforcement learning or Bayesian learning.
2. **Investigating the impact of learning on the principal's strategy.** The paper shows that the principal's optimal strategy in the learning model is different from the optimal strategy in the classic model, but it does not provide a detailed characterization of the principal's strategy in the learning model. It would be interesting to investigate this further, and to see how the principal's strategy changes as the learning model changes.
3. **Exploring the implications of the results for real-world applications.** The paper's results have implications for real-world applications of information design, such as advertising and public policy. It would be interesting to explore these implications further, and to see how the results can be used to improve the design of information campaigns and policies.
4. **Developing new algorithms for learning in information design problems.** The paper's results suggest that learning can be a powerful tool for the principal in information design problems. It would be interesting to develop new algorithms for learning in these problems, and to see how these algorithms can be used to improve the principal's performance.
5. **Investigating the impact of learning on the equilibrium of information design games.** The paper considers a single-agent information design problem, but it would be interesting to investigate how learning affects the equilibrium of information design games with multiple agents. This could lead to new insights into the behavior of information markets and the design of information policies.
