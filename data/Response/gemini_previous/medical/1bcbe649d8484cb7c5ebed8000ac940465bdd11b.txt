1. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms of resistance to afatinib in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations.** This could help identify new targets for therapy and develop strategies to overcome resistance.


2. **Evaluate the efficacy of afatinib in combination with other targeted therapies or immunotherapies in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations.** This could help improve the response rate and duration of response to treatment.


3. **Study the role of genetic testing in identifying patients with uncommon EGFR mutations who are most likely to benefit from afatinib therapy.** This could help personalize treatment and avoid unnecessary exposure to ineffective therapies.


4. **Develop new afatinib formulations or delivery methods to improve its bioavailability and reduce side effects.** This could make afatinib more tolerable and effective for patients with uncommon EGFR mutations.


5. **Conduct long-term follow-up studies to assess the durability of response to afatinib in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations.** This could provide valuable information on the long-term outcomes of patients treated with afatinib.
