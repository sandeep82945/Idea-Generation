This study introduces a novel spatial autoregressive model in which the dependent variable is a function that may exhibit functional autocorrelation with the outcome functions of nearby units. This model can be characterized as a simultaneous integral equation system, which, in general, does not necessarily have a unique solution. For this issue, we provide a simple condition on the magnitude of the spatial interaction to ensure the uniqueness in data realization. For estimation, to account for the endogeneity caused by the spatial interaction, we propose a regularized two-stage least squares estimator based on a basis approximation for the functional parameter. The asymptotic properties of the estimator including the consistency and asymptotic normality are investigated under certain conditions. Additionally, we propose a simple Wald-type test for detecting the presence of spatial effects. As an empirical illustration, we apply the proposed model and method to analyze age distributions in Japanese cities. 1 conclusion In this study, we developed a novel SAR model for analyzing spatial interactions among functional
outcomes. For estimation, we developed a penalized 2SLS estimator and established its asymptotic
properties under certain regularity conditions. Additionally, we developed a method for statistically
testing the presence of spatial interactions. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we
performed an empirical analysis focusing on the age distribution in Japanese cities. An important potential limitation of our study is that, while we have treated the covariates as fixed
variables to simplify the theoretical exposition, this approach essentially obscures the endogeneity issue
underlying the covariates. For instance, in our empirical analysis, it might be reasonable to consider
the unemployment rate as an endogenous variable correlated with unobserved regional factors affecting
the age distribution as well.
