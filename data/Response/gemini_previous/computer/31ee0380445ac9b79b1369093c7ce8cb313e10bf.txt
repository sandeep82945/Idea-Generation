1. **Investigate the use of different types of geometric features for 3D object recognition.** The proposed InOR-Net model uses local geometric structures as the basic features for object recognition. However, there are many other types of geometric features that can be used, such as global shape descriptors, surface curvature features, and volumetric features. Exploring the use of different types of geometric features could lead to further improvements in recognition accuracy.
2. **Develop more effective methods for identifying which 3D geometric characteristics are important for alleviating catastrophic forgetting.** The proposed InOR-Net model uses a critic-induced geometric attention mechanism to identify which 3D geometric characteristics are important for alleviating catastrophic forgetting. However, this mechanism is relatively simple and may not be able to capture all of the relevant factors. Developing more effective methods for identifying important geometric characteristics could lead to further improvements in forgetting mitigation.
3. **Explore the use of different types of fairness compensations for addressing class imbalance.** The proposed InOR-Net model uses a dual adaptive fairness compensations strategy to address the class imbalance problem. This strategy includes both weights and prediction scores corrections. However, there are many other types of fairness compensations that can be used, such as data augmentation and re-sampling techniques. Exploring the use of different types of fairness compensations could lead to further improvements in recognition accuracy on imbalanced datasets.
4. **Investigate the use of the proposed InOR-Net model for other 3D computer vision tasks.** The proposed InOR-Net model is designed for 3D object recognition. However, it could also be used for other 3D computer vision tasks, such as 3D scene understanding, 3D object detection, and 3D object tracking. Investigating the use of the InOR-Net model for these other tasks could lead to new insights and improved performance.
5. **Develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence and generalization properties of the proposed InOR-Net model.** The proposed InOR-Net model is a complex deep learning model, and its convergence and generalization properties are not well understood. Developing a theoretical framework for analyzing these properties could provide valuable insights into the behavior of the model and help to guide future research efforts.
