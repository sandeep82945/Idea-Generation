    "abstractText": "In this work, we investigate the relation between the photon sphere radius and the first-order phase transition for the charged Einstein-power-Yang-Mills AdS black hole. Through the analysis, we find with a certain condition there exist the non-monotonic behaviors between the photon sphere radius, the impact parameter, the non-linear YangMills charge parameter, temperature, and pressure. And both the changes of photon sphere radius and impact parameter before and after phase transition can be regarded as the order parameter, their critical exponents near the critical point are equal to the same value 1/2, just like the ordinary thermal systems. These indicate that there maybe exists a universal relation of gravity nearby the critical point for a black hole thermodynamical system. Furthermore, the effect of impact parameter on the deflect angle is also investigated.",

            "text": "Since the Hawking-Page phase transition [1] of an AdS spacetime was proposed by Hawking and Page in 1983, which was explained to a confinement/deconfinement phase transition in gauge theory in ref. [2] and could also be understood as a solid/liquid phase transition [3] by regarding the cosmological constant as pressure P = \u2212 \u039b8\u03c0 = (n\u22121)(n\u22122) 16\u03c0l2 , black hole thermodynamics has attracted lots of attention. Subsequently the phase transition in the extended AdS/dS phase space has been widely considered [4\u201331]. Based on the similarity of thermodynamic behaviors for black holes and ordinary systems, the microstructure of black holes system was investigated by the Ruppeiner scalar curvature [20] following the Ruppeiner geometry [32]. The number density of the speculative black hole molecules was introduced to examine its phase transition and microstructure. This method was quickly generalized to other black holes [33, 34]. Furthermore from the view point of the Gibbs free energy landscape, the dynamic properties of various black hole phase transitions were studied in refs. [35\u201339]. Since the phase transition of black holes is more important in black hole thermodynamics, there exists a natural question how to probe the information of the black hole phase transition.\nSo far although experimental evidences of black hole thermodynamics have not been\nfound, people still expect that black hole thermodynamics should have some observational signatures, for example the quasinormal modes (QNMs), which may be detected from astronomical observations in the future. Recently, the authors in refs. [40\u201350] had found that QNMs indeed exhibit characteristic behaviours along the black hole phase transition. Thus QNMs can be use to probe the phase transition of black holes in AdS/dS spacetime. Especially there is a dramatic change of the slope of QNMs along with the black hole phase transition [45]. These results indicate that there is a close connection between the dynamical and thermodynamical aspects of black holes. In addition, as we well known that QNMs are intimately linked to the unstable photon orbits [51\u201353], then they are playing an important role in strong gravitational phenomena (such as the shadow, lensing, and gravitational\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 7\nwaves) [54\u201362]. In short, QNMs can be regarded as the vibration frequencies of photon orbits and can be derived by the photon orbits [63]. Based on these observations, it is natural to construct the relation between the photon orbits and black hole phase transitions and to check out whether properties of photon orbits can signal the black hole phase transition.\nFirstly, people proposed that the photon orbits signals a possible York-Hawking-Page\nphase transition in refs. [64, 65]. Then the more clearly relation between photon orbits and phase transitions of Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole and rotating Kerr-AdS black hole were shown in refs. [66, 67]. Namely, the photon orbit radius and the minimum impact parameter along with the temperature are both exhibiting non-monotonic behaviours for the low pressure, whose behaviours are indeed the characters of the phase transition existence. Particularly, the changes of those two quantities near the critical point could be treated as the order parameters of phase transition, and they have an universal exponent 1/2. Subsequently, this issue has been extended to other black holes [68] and gravity theory (Gauss-Bonnet case [69], massive gravity case [70], Born-Infeld case [71, 72]). A general proof of the existence for these relations between photon orbits and phase transitions were shown in ref. [73].\nThe linear charged black holes in AdS spacetime [74, 75] within a second-order phase\ntransition show a scaling symmetry: at the critical point the state parameters scale respects to charge q, i.e., S \u223c q2, P \u223c q\u22122, T \u223c q\u22121 [76, 77]. It is naturally to gauss whether there exists the scaling symmetry in the non-linear charged AdS black holes. As a generalization of the charged AdS Einstein-Maxwell black holes, it is interesting to explore new non-linear charged systems. Due to infinite self-energy of point like charges in Maxwell\u2019s theory [78\u201382], Born and Infeld proposed a generalization when the field is strong, bringing in non-linearities [83, 84]. An interesting non-linear generalization of charged black holes involves a Yang-Mill field exponentially coupled to Einstein gravity, i.e., the Einstein-power-Yang-Mills (EPYM) theory, which possesses the conformal invariance and is easy to construct the analogues of the four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole solutions in higher dimensions. Additionally several features of the EPYM gravity in extended thermodynamics have recently been studied [30, 85, 86].\nInspired by these, we mainly investigate the relation between photon orbits and phase\ntransitions of the charged EPYM AdS black hole. This work is organized as follows. In section 2, we would like to briefly review the thermodynamic quantities and the secondorder phase transition of charged EPYM AdS black hole. The null geodesics of this system and the deflection angle are also analyzed. Furthermore we will qualitatively analyze the relation of the hawking temperatures as a function of different coordinates (the event horizon radius and photon sphere radius) respectively. In section 3, we present the behaviors of the photon orbit radius and minimum impact parameter with the temperature nearby the phase transition point and explore the influence of non-linear YM charge parameter on the phase transition. A universal exponent for the changes of photon orbit radius and minimum impact parameter before and after phase transition is also obtained. A brief summary is given in section 4.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 7"

(2.3)\nHere, Tr(F (a) \u00b5\u03bd F (a)\u00b5\u03bd) = \u22113 a=1 F (a) \u00b5\u03bd F (a)\u00b5\u03bd , R and \u03b3 are the scalar curvature and a positive real parameter, respectively; C (a) (b)(c) represent the structure constants of three-parameter Lie group G; \u03be is the coupling constant; and A (a) \u00b5 represents the SO(3) gauge group YangMills (YM) potentials defining by the Wu-Yang (WY) ansatz [90\u201392]. Variation of the action with respect to the spacetime metric g\u00b5\u03bd yields the field equations\nG\u00b5\u03bd + \u039b\u03b4 \u00b5 \u03bd = T \u00b5 \u03bd , (2.4)\nT \u00b5\u03bd = \u2212 1\n2\n( \u03b4\u00b5\u03bdF\u03b3 \u2212 4\u03b3 Tr ( F (a) \u03bd\u03bb F (a)\u00b5\u03bb ) F\u03b3\u22121 ) . (2.5)\nVariation with respect to the 1-form YM gauge potentials A (a) \u00b5 and implement the traceless yields the 2-forms YM equations\nd ( \u22c6F(a)F\u03b3\u22121 ) + 1\n\u03be C\n(a) (b)(c)F \u03b3\u22121A(b) \u2227\u22c6 F(c) = 0, (2.6)\nwhere F(a) = 12F (a) \u00b5\u03bd dx\u00b5\u2227dx\u03bd , A(b) = A(b)\u00b5 \u2227dx\u00b5, and \u22c6 stands for the duality. It is obviously that for the case of \u03b3 = 1 the EPYM theory reduces to the standard Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) theory [93, 94]. In this work our issue is paid on the role of the non-linear YM charge parameter \u03b3.\nHere we should point out that the non-Abelian property of the YM gauge field is\nexpressed with its YM potentials\nA(b) = q\nr2 C\n(a) (i)(j)x\nidxj , r2 = 3 \u2211\nj=1\nx2j , (2.7)\nand q is the YM charge, the indices (a, i, j) run the following ranges: 1 \u2264 a, i, j \u2264 3. The coordinates xi take the following forms: x1 = r cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8, x2 = r sin \u03c6 sin \u03b8, x3 = r cos \u03b8. Since we have utilized the WY ansatz for the YM field, the invariant for this field takes the form [95\u201397]\nTr(F (a)\u00b5\u03bd F (a)\u00b5\u03bd) =\nq2 r4 . (2.8)\nThis form leads to the disappearance of the structure constants which can be described the non-Abelian property of the YM gauge field. Therefore, under the condition of the WY\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 7\nansatz we may focus on the role of the non-linear YM charge parameter, instead of the non-Abelian character parameter.\nFor this system, the EPYM black hole solution with the negative cosmological constant\n\u039b in the four-dimensional spacetime is obtained by adopting the following metric [98]:\nds2 = \u2212f(r)dt2 + f\u22121dr2 + r2d\u212622, (2.9)\nf(r) = 1 \u2212 2M r \u2212 \u039b 3 r2 +\n( 2q2 )\u03b3\n2(4\u03b3 \u2212 3)r4\u03b3\u22122 , (2.10)\nwhere d\u212622 is the metric on unit 2-sphere with volume 4\u03c0 and q is the YM charge. Note that this solution is valid for the condition of the non-linear YM charge parameter \u03b3 6= 0.75, and the power YM term holds the weak energy condition (WEC) for \u03b3 > 0 [87]. In the extended phase space, \u039b was interpreted as the thermodynamic pressure P = \u2212 \u039b8\u03c0 . For \u03b3 = 1, the YM charge term in the metric has the same form as the Maxwell charge term for the Einstein-Maxwell-Yang-Mills (EMYM) theory. Thus the contribution of the YM charge term on the thermodynamic property should be same as that of the Maxwell charge term in EMYM theory. The only difference is that they have different gauge groups: the YM field is of SO(3), while the EM field is of U(1). These comments are consistent with that in ref. [85]. The black hole event horizon locates at f(r+) = 0. The parameter M represents the ADM mass of the black hole and it reads\nM(S, q, P ) = 1\n6\n\n8\u03c0P\n(\nS \u03c0\n)3/2\n+ 3\n(\nS \u03c0\n) 3\u22124\u03b3\n2\n( 2q2 )\u03b3 8\u03b3 \u2212 6 + 3 \u221a S \u03c0\n\n . (2.11)\nAnd in our set up it is associated with the enthalpy of the system. The black hole temperature, entropy, and volume were given by [86]\nT = 1\n4\u03c0r+\n 1 + 8\u03c0Pr2+ \u2212 ( 2q2 )\u03b3\n2r (4\u03b3\u22122) +\n  , S = \u03c0r2+, V = 4\u03c0r3+\n3 .

(2.13)\nThe above thermodynamic quantities satisfy the first law\ndM = TdS + \u03a8dq2\u03b3 + V dP.

(2.18)\nwhere the YM charge parameter satisfies the condition 12 < \u03b3. It is clear that this critical point closely depends on the YM charge and the non-linear YM charge parameter. We can obtain a interesting relation, which is only related with the non-linear YM charge parameter, from the above quantities as\nS2c T 2 c Pc = (2\u03b3 \u2212 1)3 16\u03c0\u03b3(4\u03b3 \u2212 1) . (2.19)\nNow we will consider a free photon orbiting around a black hole one the equatorial\nhyperplane defined by \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and p\u03b8 = 0. The Lagrangian takes the form as\nH = 1\n2 g\u00b5\u03bdp\u00b5p\u03bd =\n1 2 ( \u2212f\u22121p2t + fp2r + r\u22122p2\u03c6 ) . (2.20)\nNote that the dot represents the derivative to the affine parameter and p\u00b5 are the generalized momentums. For this black hole background, there are two Killing fields \u2202t and \u2202\u03c6, which lead two constants, the particle energy E and orbital angular momentum L along each geodesics\n\u2212 E = pt = \u2212f(r)t\u0307, L = p\u03c6 = r2\u03c6\u0307. (2.21)\nThe light rays are the solutions to Hamilton\u2019s equations\np\u0307\u00b5 = \u2212 \u2202H\n\u2202x\u00b5 , x\u0307\u00b5 =\n\u2202H \u2202p\u00b5 , (2.22)\nwhich read\np\u0307t = 0, p\u0307\u03c6 = 0, p\u0307\u03b8 = 0,\np\u0307r = \u2212 1\n2\n(\nf \u2032p2t f2 + f \u2032p2r + 2fprp \u2032 r \u2212 2p2\u03c6 r3\n)\n,\nt\u0307 = \u2212pt f , r\u0307 = fpr, \u03c6\u0307 = p\u03c6 r2 . (2.23)\nWith H = 0, we have\nr\u03072 + Veff = 0, Veff = L2f\nr2 \u2212 E2. (2.24)\nAs an example, we exhibit the effective potential in figure 1 for the EPYM AdS black hole with the fixed parameters \u03b3 = 1.01, P = 0.003, q = 1.9, M = 2, and different angular momentums L/E. Since the positive of r\u03072, there exists the condition: Veff < 0.

The effective potential for the EPYM AdS black h ole with the parameters \u03b3 = 1.01, P = 0.003, q = 1.9, M = 2. The angular momentums L/E of the photon varies from 0.5 to 36 from bottom to top.\nphoton can only survive in the range of negative effective potential. When the conserved quantum L is small, the photon will fall into the black hole from somewhere with a larger value of r. While, for the larger value of L, the peak of effective potential will increase, that leads to the reflection of photon before it falls into black hole. Between these two cases, there exists a critical case which is described by the thickness red line, whose peak approaches zero at r = 4.3122 and at the same time the radial velocity of photon vanishes. This point just corresponds to the photon sphere because of the spherically symmetric static black hole. In the following, we mainly discuss the relation between the photon sphere radius and phase transition of the EPYM AdS black hole.\nThe unstable circular photon sphere is determined by\nVeff = 0, dVeff dr = 0, d2Veff dr2 < 0. (2.25)\nFrom the second equation, we find that the radius rph satisfies\n2f(r) |rph= rf \u2032(r) |rph . (2.26)\nFor given the metric function, we also obtain the radius from the above equation. Solving the first equation, the impact parameter or the angular momentum of the photon is\n\u00b5ph \u2261 L\nEc =\nr \u221a\nf(r)\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nrph\n. (2.27)\nFrom this relation, we have the behaviors of the non-linear YM charge parameter and the impact parameter with the photon sphere radius, which are shown in figure 2. It is obviously that there exist the critical curves when given the pressure and mass of black hole. The corresponding critical values are exhibited in table 1. The critical impact parameter, radius, and non-linear YM charge parameter are both increasing with the YM charge.\nAdditionally, we will qualitatively analyze the relation of the phase transition both\nin the photon sphere radius coordinate and the event horizon radius coordinate in the following. The corresponding quantitative results will be presented in the next section.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 7\ncritical curve\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\nrph\n\u0393\n(a) q = 1.9, \u00b52ph = 1, 10, 21.6, 27, 28, 28.5.\ncritical curve\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nrph\n\u039c p\nh\n(b) q = 2.\nFigure 2. \u03b3 and \u00b5ph vs. rph with P = 0.003, M = 2.

The angle as the function of impact parameter with the parameters \u03b3 = 1, P = 0.0003, q = 1.9, M = 2. The observer\u2019s position varies from 1 to 1000 from the red line to the black one.\nSince the photon sphere radius meet the requirements in eqs. (2.26) and (2.27), so we have\nrph = rph(r+), or r+ = r+(rph), (2.28)\nf \u2032(rph) = 2rph \u00b52ph = df(rph) drph = df(r+) dr+ dr+ drph > 0. (2.29)\nBecause the temperature should be positive, we can obtain\ndf(r+)\ndr+ =\nT\n4\u03c0 > 0. (2.30)\nBy combining above two expressions, we have\ndr+ drph > 0, (2.31)\nwhich implies that there is a monotonously increasing relation between the event horizon radius and the photon sphere radius. For the van de Waals-like phase transitions for EPYM AdS black holes, the critical point is determined by the following equations\ndT (r+)\ndr+\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr+=rc\n= d2T (r+)\ndr2+\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr+=rc\n= 0, (2.32)\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 7\nwhere rc is the critical event horizon radius of EPYM black holes. We just want to know whether this relation can be transferred to the photon sphere radius case. As\ndT (r+)\ndr+\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr+=rc\n= dT (rph)\ndrph drph dr+\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr+=rc\n= 0, (2.33)\nwe can know that there must exist a critical photon sphere radius rphc that is of the following form dT (rph)\ndrph\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nrph=rphc\n= 0 (2.34)\nafter considering eq. (2.31). Here the relation T (r+) = T (r+(rph)) = T (rph) has been kept in mind. From the relation\nd2T (r+)\ndr2+\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr+=rc\n=\n[\nd2T (rph)\ndr2ph drph dr+ + dT (rph) drph d drph\n(\ndrph dr+\n)\n]\n\u00d7 drph dr+\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr+=rc\n= 0 (2.35)\ntogether with the conditions eqs. (2.31) and (2.34), we can obtain\ndT (rph)\ndrph\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nrph=rphc\n= d2T (rph)\ndr2ph\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nrph=rphc\n= 0. (2.36)\nFrom eqs. (2.32) and (2.36), we can know that the critical point in the r+ \u2212 T diagram corresponds to the one in the rph \u2212 T diagram. Apart from this, we can also know that\ndT (r+)\ndr+ =\ndT (rph)\ndrph drph dr+ > 0 or < 0 (2.37)\ncan correspond to dT (rph)\ndrph > 0 or < 0, (2.38)\nrespectively as we have the relation eq. (2.31), which means that the correspondence between r+ \u2212 T diagram and rph \u2212 T diagram exists beyond the critical points. Next, we will investigate the effect of the angular momentum on the observer\u2019s angle, especially the critical angle with the maximum impact parameter. Considering light rays sent from an observer at radius coordinate r0 into the past. These light rays can be divided into two classes: light rays of the first class go to infinity after being deflected by the black hole. Light rays of the second one go towards the horizon of the black hole. If there are no light sources between the observer and the black hole, initial directions of the second class\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 7\ncorrespond to darkness on the observer\u2019s sky. This dark circular disk on the observer\u2019s sky is called the shadow of the black hole. The boundary of the shadow is determined by the initial directions of light rays that asymptotically spiral towards the outermost photon sphere. Note that the light rays in the photon sphere are unstable with respect to radial perturbations.\nWe consider a light ray that is sent from the observer\u2019s position at r0 into the past under\nan deflection angle \u03b1 with respect to the radial direction. The deflection angle is given by\ncot \u03b1 =\n\u221a\ngrr g\u03c6\u03c6 dr d\u03c6\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr0\n=\n\u221a\n1 f(r)r2 dr d\u03c6\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr0\n. (2.39)\nFrom eqs. (2.20) and (2.23), we have the orbit equation\ndr d\u03c6 = \u221a f(r)r2\n\u221a\nr2\u00b52 f(r) \u2212 1 (2.40)\nwith the impact parameter or the angular momentum \u00b5 \u2261 LE . Thus the deflection angle \u03b1 satisfies\nsin2 \u03b1 = f(r0)\nr20\u00b5 2\n. (2.41)\nEspecially, the critical angle reads sin2 \u03b1c = f(r0) \u00b52\nph r2 0\n. That indicates that \u00b5 has a close\nrelation with the critical deflection angle and the observer\u2019s position, which is just the phenomenon of the black hole lensing. For the light ray with the large impact parameter, its deflection angle is small. Gradually decreasing \u00b5 to \u00b5ph, the deflection angle will be larger and larger, until to the bounded one \u03b1c. These behaviors are presented in figure 3. That is consistent with that showed in ref. [54].\nAs what we have shown in the above, there are two important quantities rph and \u00b5ph for\na photon sphere. In the following, we will probe the detailed behaviors of these two quantities near phase transition, and discuss whether they carry the phase transition information."

The coexistent curve of P \u2212 T .\nAnd we also investigated the effect of the non-linear YM charge parameter \u03b3 on the phase transition from two different viewpoints. Firstly, from the viewpoint of the coexistent curve (P \u2212T ), when fixed the YM electric q we found that for a given temperature (T < Tc) or a given pressure (P < Pc), the pressure or the temperature and the radius of the coexistent big black hole phase increase with the increasing of \u03b3; while the radius of the coexistent small black hole phase decreases with \u03b3. Here the two-phases coexistent curves in the T \u2212P plane with different values of the non-linear YM charge parameter \u03b3 are shown in figure 4. Secondly, from the viewpoint of the geometry scalar curvature, the absolute values of the scalar curvature for the coexistent big and small black holes in the range of 3/4 < \u03b3 \u2264 1 both decrease with the increasing of \u03b3, while their behavior of the scalar curvature are just opposite in the range of 1 \u2264 \u03b3. In the following, we only exhibit the behaviors of the photon sphere radius as the function of temperature in two cases of \u03b3 = 1 (the analytical solution) and \u03b3 = 1.5 (the numerical Solution), respectively. Since the solutions of the photon sphere radius with other values of \u03b3 are difficult to present, so we cannot give the relevant analysis and conclusions.\nFor \u03b3 = 1, the photon sphere radius of this system can be expressed as\nrph = 1\n2\n(\n3M + \u221a 9M2 \u2212 8q2 ) . (3.3)\nIt is clear that this result is exactly equal to that of the asymptotically flat charged black hole, in which the orbit radius depends on the pressure. However, we need to note that the mass of eq. (2.11) is related with the pressure. Substituting it into above equation, we have the photon sphere radius\nrph = 3\u03c0q2 + S(3 + 8PS) +\n\u221a\n[3\u03c0q2 + S(3 + 8PS)]2 \u2212 32\u03c0q2S 4 \u221a \u03c0S .

The YM charge set to q = 1.9. The pressure varies from Pc \u2212 0.0002 to Pc + 0.00004 from bottom to top.\nThe temperature in eq. (2.12) can be rewritten as\nT (S, P, q) = 1\n4 \u221a \u03c0S\n(\n1 + 8PS \u2212 \u03c0q 2\nS\n)\n. (3.6)\nCombining eqs. (3.4) and (3.6), we give the behavior of temperature as a function of the photon sphere radius with the fixed pressure, which is shown in figure 5a. It is obviously that for P < Pc, there will be a non-monotonic behavior. However, the temperature will become only a monotone increasing function of the photon sphere radius when the pressure is bigger than the critical one. At the critical pressure, there is a deflection point at rph = rphc. That behavior is very similar to the isobar of the vdW\u2019s system in T \u2212 S plane, which means there exists the first-order phase transition. Thought constructing the Maxwell\u2019s equal-area law, we also obtain the phase transition point.\nThe behavior of the temperature as a function of the impact parameter square in\nFigs 5b. Interestingly, it also confirms a non-monotonic property for P < Pc. And it becomes monotonous for P \u2264 Pc. These non-monotonic behaviors in rph \u2212 T and \u00b52ph \u2212 T diagrams indicate the existence of a first-order phase transition. So are these phase transitions rph \u2212 T and \u00b52ph \u2212 T diagrams just the ones between the high-potential black hole phase and low-potential black hole phase? We will illustrate this by depicting phase diagrams in the r+ \u2212 T and rph \u2212 T planes under the same condition (see figure 6a). From the figures, we can see that the r+\u2212T and rph\u2212T diagrams share the synchronized variation trend. The correspondence between T \u2032(r+) and T \u2032(rph), as well as between T \u2032\u2032(r+) and T \u2032\u2032(rph), shown in lase part has been conspicuously corroborated. That means that the correspondence between r+ \u2212 T and rph \u2212 T diagrams exists beyond the critical points. Thus the first-order phase transition temperature both in r+ \u2212T and rph \u2212T curves are the same, which is caused by the coordinate transformation between the horizon radius and the photon sphere radius. From the physical perspective, this phenomenon is equivalent to the situation: the observer is a static observer at infinity, and the object of study is EPYM\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 7\n0 5 10 15 20 r+,ph 0.0202\n0.0204\n0.0206\n0.0208\n0.0210\n0.0212 T\n(a) \u03b3 = 1.\n0 10 20 30 40 r+,ph0.020\n0.022\n0.024\n0.026\n0.028\nT\n(b) \u03b3 = 1.5.\nFigure 6.

The red lines stand for the curves with the event horizon radius coordinate, and the blue lines are the curves with the photon sphere radius coordinate.\nAdS black hole undergoing a phase transition; and neither the observer nor the object of research has changed, so the thermodynamical properties of the system will not change.\nFurthermore, when \u03b3 = 1.5 we also present the numerical results of the temperature\nwith the photon sphere radius and impact parameter for different pressures in figure 7. The phase transition relationship from two different viewpoints of the photon sphere radius and the horizon radius is also exhibited in figure 6b. Those behaviors in this case are similar to that in the case of \u03b3 = 1. In other words, in both two cases of \u03b3 = 1 and \u03b3 = 1.5 rph and \u00b5 2 ph have the non-monotonic behavior and exhibit the first-order phase transition under a certain condition. And the photon sphere radius of two coexistent phases of the system are both larger than them from the viewpoint of the horizon radius. These results are the same in these two cases. While the differences shown in figure 8 are that: the phase transition temperature with \u03b3 = 1.5 is high than the one with \u03b3 = 1; the photon sphere radii and impact parameter of two coexistent phases are different in this two cases.\nIn order to probe the changes of the photon sphere radius and the impact parameter\nduring the phase transition process, we present the temperature as a function of the photon sphere radius with different pressure (P < Pc) in figure 9. The dashed lines stand for the coexistent phases, the corresponding phase transition temperature is determined by eq. (3.6). With the increasing of photon sphere radius, the phase transitions will emerge at the dashed lines. And there existences the sudden change of photon sphere radius. Further increasing the pressure or temperature to the critical values, the sudden change of photon sphere radius disappears: \u2206rph \u2261 rph2 \u2212rph1 = 0. Thus if the photon sphere radius has a sudden change, the black hole must be undergoing a first-order phase transition. The similar conclusions hold for the case between the impact parameter and temperature.

At the same time the first-order phase transition becomes the second-order one. Therefore the changes of reduced photon sphere radius and reduced impact parameter can be regarded the order parameters for the black hole phase transition.\nIt is well known that the critical exponent of the order parameter for a ordinary\nthermodynamic system nearby the critical point equals to 1/2, whether these two order parameters have the same value of critical exponent.

That indicates from the viewpoint of thermodynamic black holes have more similar behaviors as the ordinary thermal systems, and they maybe also have the similar microstructures from the perspective of the statistics [20]. Those conclusions strongly imply there exist a relationship between the photon sphere radius and phase transition of black holes."

            "text": "In this manuscript, we examined the relationship between the photon sphere radius the thermodynamic phase transition for the four-dimensional charge Einstein-power-Yang-Mills (EPYM) AdS black hole. This will provide a new way to realize the link between the gravity and thermodynamics of black holes.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 7\nFirst, we presented the characters of EPYM AdS black hole phase transition: the\ncritical point depend on the YM charge and non-linear YM charge parameter with the condition \u03b3 > 1/2 and \u03b3 6= 3/4. Since the critical point stands for the boundary of the coexistent phases, it is keys to probe the black hole phase structure. Then we investigated the null geodesics of a photon in the equatorial plane of EPYM AdS black hole background. By analyzing the effective potential of photon orbits with the certain parameters, we obtained the photon sphere radius and impact parameter (angular momentum of the photon sphere). The results showed that the non-monotonic behaviors appear in \u03b3 \u2212 rph and \u00b5ph \u2212 rph diagrams. That indicated that there exists a certain relationship between the photon sphere radius, impact parameter, and EPYM AdS black hole phase transitions. In addition, we also presented the influence of impact parameter on the reflected angle.\nFinally, we further explored the relation between the unstable photon sphere radius,\nimpact parameter, and thermodynamic phase transition. It mainly contains three aspects as the following:\n\u2022 For the isobar and isotherm processes of this system, the photon sphere radius and\nimpact parameter have the non-monotonic behaviors with the certain parameters. When the pressure or temperature is less than the corresponding critical value, these two quantities both have two extremal points. Until the pressure or temperature approaches to the critical one, two extremal points coincide with each other. When the pressure or temperature is more than the critical one, there is no extremal point. Thus, the photon sphere radius and impact parameter are the non-monotonic functions with the pressure or temperature. Those behaviors of the photon sphere radius and impact parameter are consistent with that of the black hole thermodynamics. Therefore, the behavior of photon sphere can be regarded a probe to reveal the thermodynamic phase transition information of black holes;\n\u2022 No mater the qualitative analysis and quantitative calculation, the behaviours both\nin the r+ \u2212 T and rph \u2212 T diagrams have the synchronized variation trend. The correspondence between T \u2032(r+) and T \u2032(rph), as well as between T \u2032\u2032(r+) and T \u2032\u2032(rph) have been conspicuously corroborated. In other words, the phase transition information (including the first-order transition and the critical point) of the EPYM AdS black hole can be reflected by its surrounding particle\u2019s circular orbit (photon sphere orbit);\n\u2022 At the first-order phase transition point, the photon sphere radius and impact pa-\nrameter both have a sudden change. The changes of them before and after first-order phase transition can act as order parameters to describe EPYM AdS black hole phase transitions. More importantly, at the critical point, the fitting result displays that they have a same critical exponent of 1/2.\nThose analyze firmly enhance our conjecture that there exists the relationship be-\ntween the null geometry and thermodynamic phase transition for EPYM AdS black holes. It further supports the link between the gravity and thermodynamics of black holes, and also provides a possible way to describe the strong gravitational effect from the thermodynamic side.\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 7"
