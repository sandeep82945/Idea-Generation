    "abstractText": "Aims Valid health economic models are essential to inform the adoption and reimbursement of therapies for diabetes mellitus. Often existing health economic models are applied in other countries and settings than those where they were developed. This practice requires assessing the transferability of a model developed from one setting to another. We evaluate the transferability of the MICADO model, developed for the Dutch 2007 setting, in two different settings using a range of adjustment steps. MICADO predicts microand macrovascular events at the population level. Methods MICADO simulation results were compared to observed events in an Italian 2000\u20132015 cohort (Casale Monferrato Survey [CMS]) and in a Dutch 2008\u20132019 (Hoorn Diabetes Care Center [DCS]) cohort after adjusting the demographic characteristics. Additional adjustments were performed to: (1) risk factors prevalence at baseline, (2) prevalence of complications, and (3) all-cause mortality risks by age and sex. Model validity was assessed by mean average percentage error (MAPE) of cumulative incidences over 10 years of follow-up, where lower values mean better accuracy. Results For mortality, MAPE was lower for CMS compared to DCS (0.38 vs. 0.70 following demographic adjustment) and adjustment step 3 improved it to 0.20 in CMS, whereas step 2 showed best results in DCS (0.65). MAPE for heart failure and stroke in DCS were 0.11 and 0.22, respectively, while for CMS was 0.42 and 0.41. Conclusions The transferability of the MICADO model varied by event and per cohort. Additional adjustments improved prediction of events for MICADO. To ensure a valid model in a new setting it is imperative to assess the impact of adjustments in terms of model accuracy, even when this involves the same country, but a new time period.",

            "text": "The international diabetes federation (IDF) estimated that the number of adults (aged 20\u201379\u00a0years) with diabetes will increase from 463 million in 2019 to 700 million in 2045 [1]. Preventing diabetes complications through effective and cost-effective care is therefore an important task of health policy makers [2]. Health economic decision models are used to inform health policy decision making concerning diabetes management. These models allow to simulate the natural history of disease and translate the impact of treatments from short-term outcomes as measured in experimental studies to decision-relevant outcomes such as (quality-adjusted) life expectancy [3]. Such models are usually initially developed for a specific jurisdiction, usually a country. Furthermore, the use of input data from a certain time period implies a certain base year. However, subsequent model applications may require transfer to other settings and time periods. Diabetes health economic decision models are mainly used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treatments. Several health economic decision models of diabetes have been developed and validated in the past decades [2], including MICADO (Modeling Integrated Care for Diabetes based on Observational data), which was developed for the Netherlands.\nThe MICADO model projects the prevalence and effect of both micro- and macrovascular complications in populations with diabetes. This model was developed to reflect the diabetes population in the Netherlands in 2007, and has been validated both internally and externally [3]. This model participated in several Mount Hood Challenges for cross-validation [4]. The structure of MICADO was based on the Dutch Chronic Disease Model [5].\nIt is common practice to transfer health economic models to the setting of relevance to the decision-maker when evaluating new treatments in that setting. In such cases, decision-makers want to know if a model is valid for use in their own country and time period, and whether it needs to be adjusted to achieve this. Assessing and enhancing the transferability of health economic decision models is challenging [6, 7]. Health economic models comprise several correlated parameters and simulate a variety of outcomes, from event-specific rates to (quality-adjusted) life expectancy. Some deliberate examples of health economic models being transferred to a new setting have been published [8, 9], while many more exist, usually as part of health technology assessment dossiers. However, previous studies rarely assessed the validity of the transferred model predictions and often focused on producing costeffectiveness results in the new setting, without paying much attention to revalidating the transferred model in its new setting. Most often, adjustments focus on replicating\nthe demographic characteristics of the new setting, as well as using country-specific utilities and costs. This lack of explicit attention for re-validating a transferred model and assessing more fully its transferability may relate to the rather qualitative approach taken by most transferability tools.\nIn this paper, we evaluate the transferability of the diabetes simulation part of MICADO to (1) a more contemporary Dutch setting and (2) an Italian setting by explicit and elaborate validation against empirical data. We aim to assess its transferability in an objective way and infer guidance regarding the adjustment steps needed for any health economic decision model of diabetes to be transferred to a new setting."

The transition rates hence depend on age category, sex, and category of HbA1c-level, as well as on further risk factors by categories (smoking status; Body Mass Index, BMI; systolic blood pressure, SBP; and total cholesterol). Risks of cardiovascular complications in diabetes were modeled using age, sex, and risk factor, that also vary depending on pre-existing events, which were derived from a literature review. The detailed structure of the model has been published previously [14, 15]. Based on the risk factors and pre-existing events, the model simulates at the population level the incidence and prevalence of microvascular (diabetic foot, nephropathy and retinopathy) and macrovascular (myocardial infarction [MI], chronic heart failure [CHF] and stroke) diabetes-related complications, and provides estimates for all-cause mortality (by age and sex), complication-related mortality, costs of complications, and QALYs. In the current study, we focused on macrovascular events and all-cause mortality. We report more details on MICADO inputs in Supplementary Materials (see section \u201cInput data into MICADO\u201d)."

We reviewed the seven transferability checklists and tools for items referring specifically to the disease simulation part of decision models [16]. Common across the checklists, is the reliance on expert opinion to assess the transferability of a model and the need for any adjustments.\nThe transfer items identified in the checklists, concerning decision models, were as follows: age and sex, health status and severity of disease, life expectancy, complication rates, socio-economic and educational status. Based on these transfer items, MICADO met the criteria of being capable of transfer across different settings. Hence, to transfer MICADO, we adjusted the model for each of these items\nin discrete steps to the CMS and DCS settings (see Supplementary material, section \u201cAssessing transferability of MICADO\u201d for more detail). For comparison, our base case adjustment reflects a minimal adjustment, consisting of using the demographic characteristics of the new setting. We then evaluated the impact of each additional adjustment step (see Table\u00a02) on the accuracy/validity of the model by comparing outcome predictions to actual observed events over time. The main reason for such order was that the complexity of model would increase by each step and needs more data for adjusting the model. The adjustments started with adjusting demography (base case) and ended with adjusting mortality rate based on age and sex (adjustment step 3)."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "It is important to assess the transferability of diabetes simulation models and validate transferred models before using them in different settings with confidence. After adjusting for demography, the MICADO model predicted mortality rates close to the observed values for the Italian cohort but it overestimated the rates of MI and underestimated the rates of stroke and CHF. In the Dutch cohort, the MICADO model overestimated the mortality and MI rates but showed a good fit for CHF and stroke. Additional adjustments improved the model fit, pointing at inadequacy of adjusting demographic\ncharacteristics only, without proper validation against empirical data from the new setting.\nThe MICADO model was developed based on Dutch data on mortality rates by age and sex, and the prevalence of events in 2007 [14]. While the Italian CMS cohort consisted of the individuals followed from 2000 to 2017, the Dutch DCS cohort had a follow-up from 2008 till 2019. In regression models, cross-validation is usually performed in regression analysis or prediction modeling studies to reduce overfitting. However, in the current study, we did not perform a regression analysis or fit a prediction model. Rather we applied an existing health economic simulation model (MICADO) to two independent cohorts. Since MICADO was not developed based on the two cohorts, overfitting is not relevant here. Rather, each adjustment step made while applying the model to the independent cohorts can be seen as external validation. The variation in the model accuracy concerning mortality across\n1 3\nthe cohorts might be explained by differences in the time periods covered by the model and cohorts. Moreover, the observed mortality rate of the Dutch diabetes cohort was almost 30% lower than the Italian cohort, suggesting that the Dutch cohort consisted of a better controlled diabetes population. In a previous study which compared the diabetes type 2 treatment across European countries, they reported that the guidelines for intensification of treatment (by adding a sulfonylurea) in Italy are less strict than the Netherlands [20]. Additionally, the diabetes care program in the DCS was structured and centralized with annual elaborate check-ups by a diabetes nurse [10].\nOur findings show that model adjustments recommended in transferability checklists have limited impact in model predictions and the overall fit of MICADO across the two cohorts. For MI, more extensive adjustments even led to an increase in the MAPE. No single adjustment was clearly the best performing in both settings and across all outcomes. The most complex adjustments did not result necessarily in higher accuracy. However, the MICADO model met the checklist criteria for a transferable model and we were able to make several of the recommended adjustments to new settings. This highlights the potential limitations of basing the criteria in transferability checklists on expert opinion without formal assessments of model accuracy in the new setting. Validation against empirical data is an essential step in the transfer of a health economic diabetes model to a new setting. As pointed out in our study, validation and uncertainty were among the most important aspects of the ISPOR modeling good research practice [21]. To do so, we followed the common practice to measure the relative difference in the predicted against observed cumulative point estimates [18, 22].\nComparing the transferability of the MICADO model with previous transferability studies in type 2 diabetes modeling is challenging. We identified two studies, one assessing the transferability of the Building, Relating, Assessing, and Validating Outcomes (BRAVO) risk engine[23] (a US-based model) and another assessing the UKPDS Outcomes Model (UKPDS-OM) [24] (a UK-based model). The BRAVO model showed significant improvement of prediction accuracy for different global settings (the United States, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia) after re-calibration of the hazard ratios of MI, stroke, CHF, angina, revascularization and all-cause mortality [25]. The UKPDS-OM was transferred to an Australian population by re-estimating the model equations for predicting mortality of diabetes-related complications using a large local diabetes dataset. Similar to BRAVO, they reported a significant improvement on model fit following re-calibration [26]. Similar to our findings, these studies concluded that adjusting the model for the cohort-specific characteristics further improved the prediction accuracy and the validation of outcomes is required.Ta bl e 3 T he a dj us tm en t s te ps w ith th e lo w es t M A PE a nd th e pe rc en ta ge\no f d\nec re\nas e\nin th\ne M\nA PE\nre la\ntiv e\nto th\ne ba\nse c\nas e\nad ju\nstm en\nt a nd\nth e\nob se\nrv ed\nv er\nsu s p\nre di\nct ed\na t y\nea r 1\n0\nC M S\nC as\nal e\nm on\nfe rr\nat o\nsu rv\ney , D\nC S\nho or\nn di\nab et\nes c\nar e\nsy ste\nm , C\nI co\nnfi de\nnc e\nin te\nrv al\n, A S\nad ju\nstm en\nt s te\np, M\nAP E\nm ea\nn ab\nso lu\nte p\ner ce\nnt ag\ne er\nro r, M I\nm yo\nca rd\nia l i\nnf ar\nct io\nn, C H F\nch ro\nni c\nhe ar\nt f ai\nlu re\n, B C\nb as\ne ca se *T he lo w er v al ue s m ea n\na be\ntte r fi\nt\nO ut\nco m\ne C\nM S\nD C\nS\nO bs\ner ve\nd (%\n) 95\n% C\nI ( %\n) Pr\ned ic\nte d\n(% )\nA S\nM A\nPE * ,\n(% )\nC ha\nng e\n(% )\nO bs\ner ve\nd (%\n) 95\n% C\nI ( %\n) Pr\ned ic\nte d\n(% )\nA S\nM A\nPE * (\n% )\nC ha\nng e\n(% )\nO ve\nra ll\nm or\nta lit\ny 40\n37 \u20134\n2 38\n3 20\n48 26\n24 \u20132\n7 35\n2 65 8 M I 7 6\u2013 8 11 B C 77 \u2013 3 2\u2013 3 11 B C 25 8 \u2013 C H F 12 11 \u20131 4 8 2 42 4 4 4\u2013 5 6 B C 11 \u2013 St ro ke 10 9\u2013 12 6 1 41 3 5 4\u2013 6 6 2 22 7\n1 3\nThe DCS and CMS cohorts were used previously to assess the validity of version 2 of the UKPDS-OM [27]. The approach used in that work, coincided with our adjustment step 2 (i.e., adjusting for demography, risk factors and preexisting events). However, no adjustment of mortality was performed, i.e., our step 3. This was due to the complexity of the UKPDS-OM, which uses 15 different connected prediction functions to estimate outcomes, including all-cause mortality [28]. Although MICADO and UKPD-OM have a different structure and were built using different input data, the performance of these two models on the Italian CMS and the Dutch DCS cohorts were quite similar. Both models predicted a mortality rate in CMS close to observed values but for DCS, they overestimated mortality. MI was overestimated by both models in these two cohorts. Both models predicted CHF and stroke in DCS close to observed values but overestimated them for CMS. This provides further support to the period effects as a partial explanation for poor performance of both models regarding MI and mortality. Also, the difference between population characteristics in Italy and the Netherlands might be another explanation (such as higher mortality rate in the Italian cohort).\nFor single outcome/equation prediction models, re-calibration of intercepts and the coefficients are routinely performed after transfer to a new setting [29]. However, re-calibration of decision models is more complex as their baseline risk of events is not informed by a single parameter, like the intercept or baseline hazard in a single risk prediction model. Many current applications only partially adjust population characteristics and seldom validate the decision model in the new setting. Re-calibration is a complex task requiring adjusting parameters across several interconnected equations and checking their joint impact on model predictions. Hence, we did not perform re-calibration, i.e., adjustment/ re-estimation of risk equations, but rather adapted MICADO by changing the characteristics of the simulated population to match those of the validation cohort as well as updating general mortality rates to those more suitable for each validation setting. However, the adjustment of individual risk equations may be justifiable when using diabetes models to simulate the risks of MI, CHF and stroke in contemporary cohorts similar to the CMS or DCS.\nOur work is not without limitations. We did not adjust relative risks of diabetic complications and risk factors in our adjustment steps. For MICADO, these model parameters were derived from reviews of international literature [30]. Furthermore, we did not adjust for the incidence and case fatality risk of complications, and the transitions of risk factors. The reasons for not doing so were absence of data in the CMS cohort. However, our sensitivity analyses showed that different transition rates had little impact on the model predictions. Socio-economic status was another parameter recommended for adjustment in transferability\nchecklists. However, the MICADO model only allowed for adjustment for patient\u2019s age, sex, risk factor levels and preexisting events. Finally, the MICADO model is a cohort level state-transition model while many diabetes simulation models consist of patient-level state transition models, or discrete event simulation models [19, 24, 31, 32]. Our findings and adjustment steps may be more relevant to other cohort models [33\u201339], than to patient level models.\nStrengths of this study were the use of two relatively large cohorts from different settings allowing evaluating transferability of a Dutch model to a setting outside the Netherlands, covering the same period as the original model, and a more contemporary Dutch setting. Another strength is that the adjustments needed to transfer the model to the new settings, were systematically performed in a stepwise way, assessing performance of the model for each adjustment step.\nIn conclusion, the MICADO model showed good transferability for mortality in the Italian CMS cohort, and for CHF and stroke in the Dutch DCS cohort. We showed that additional adjustments, especially regarding the baseline distribution of risk factors in the population, improved the prediction accuracy of mortality, MI and stroke for MICADO. However, our findings suggest that the most complex adjustment steps did not always result in the most accurate model. Therefore, simply performing the model adjustments as suggested in transferability checklists do not necessarily translate into a valid model in a new setting. This highlights the need for model validation using observed data rather than relying solely on expert opinion to assess its transferability. After this has been established, additional adjustments on other model elements needed for economic evaluations such as costs and utilities can be performed.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00592- 022- 01891-2.\nFunding This project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No. 754425 and the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under Grant agreement No 115881 (RHAPSODY).\nData availability Restrictions apply to the availability of data generated or analyzed during this study to preserve patient confidentiality or because they were used under license.
