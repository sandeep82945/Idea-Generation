1. **Investigate the use of nHWT-DIMS models for forecasting other types of time series data.** The nHWT-DIMS models presented in this paper have been shown to be effective for forecasting electricity demand. However, it is possible that they could also be used to forecast other types of time series data, such as sales data, weather data, or financial data.
2. **Develop new methods for initializing the parameters of nHWT-DIMS models.** The initialization of the parameters of nHWT-DIMS models is a critical step in the forecasting process. However, there is currently no consensus on the best way to initialize these parameters. Future research could focus on developing new methods for initializing the parameters of nHWT-DIMS models that are more accurate and efficient.
3. **Explore the use of nHWT-DIMS models for forecasting in real-time.** The nHWT-DIMS models presented in this paper are designed for forecasting in a batch setting. However, it is possible that they could also be used for forecasting in real-time. Future research could focus on developing methods for using nHWT-DIMS models for forecasting in real-time.
4. **Investigate the use of nHWT-DIMS models for forecasting in the presence of missing data.** Missing data is a common problem in time series forecasting. Future research could focus on investigating the use of nHWT-DIMS models for forecasting in the presence of missing data.
5. **Develop a user-friendly interface for the nHWT-DIMS toolbox.** The nHWT-DIMS toolbox is a powerful tool for forecasting time series data. However, it can be difficult for users to use the toolbox effectively. Future research could focus on developing a user-friendly interface for the nHWT-DIMS toolbox that makes it easier for users to use the toolbox to forecast time series data.
