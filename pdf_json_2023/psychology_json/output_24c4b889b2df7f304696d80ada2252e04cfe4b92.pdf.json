    "abstractText": "Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are a protein family with a wide variety of roles and binding partners. Among them, TRAF6, a ubiquitin ligase, possesses unique receptor binding specificity and shows diverse functions in immune system regulation, cellular signaling, central nervous system, and tumor formation. TRAF6 consists of an N-terminal Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain, multiple zinc fingers, and a C-terminal TRAF domain. TRAF6 is an important therapeutic target for various disorders and structural studies of this protein are crucial for the development of next-generation therapeutics. Here, we presented a TRAF6 Nterminal structure determined at the Turkish light source \u201cTurkish DeLight\u201d to be 3.2 \u00c5 resolution at cryogenic temperature (PDB ID: 8HZ2). This structure offers insight into the domain organization and zinc-binding, which are critical for protein function. Since the RING domain and the zinc fingers are key targets for TRAF6 therapeutics, structural insights are crucial for future research. Separately, we rationally designed numerous new compounds and performed molecular docking studies using this template (PDB ID:8HZ2). According to the results, 10 new compounds formed key interactions with essential residues and zinc ion in the N-terminal region of TRAF6. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed for 300 ns to evaluate the stability of three docked complexes (compounds 256, 322, and 489). Compounds 256 and 489 was found to possess favorable bindings with TRAF6. These new compounds also showed moderate to good pharmacokinetic profiles, making them potential future drug candidates as TRAF6 inhibitors.",

            "text": "Zinc finger proteins are widely distributed transcription factors in the human genome with an array of biological functions. These functions include those associated with ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, signal transduction, differentiation, metabolism, apoptosis, autophagy, migration, invasion, and a plethora of other processes. These functions arise from the capability of zinc finger proteins to interact with their particular DNA and RNA targets. Zinc finger proteins are dependent on Zn2+ cations, which can bind to cysteine and histidine residues. These proteins can be separated into distinct members of classical and non-classical types, referring to proteins whose zinc fingers contain the signature cys-cys-his-his (C2H2) motif and those that do not. Despite the great endeavors for the identification of the majority of zinc finger motifs, the structures of most of them have remained poorly characterized [1\u20134]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family proteins are key regulatory molecules in the immune and inflammatory systems. They are the main signal transducers for the TNF receptor, the Interleukin-1 receptor/Toll-like receptor (IL-1/TLR), and NOD-like receptor (NLR) superfamilies. Until recently, TRAFs were classified as classical members (TRAF1-6) and a single nonclassical member (TRAF7) [5\u20137]. In general, TRAFs (TRAF1-7) adopt a common structure including the Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain (except for TRAF1), zinc finger motifs, a coiled-coil domain, and a highly conserved C-terminal \u03b2-sandwich domain (TRAF-C or MATH domain). Apart from TRAF7, other TRAF proteins share a common structure at the TRAF-C domain. The RING domain is responsible for E3 ubiquitin ligase activity structurally supported by the zinc fingers. TRAF6 is a well-characterized E3 ubiquitin ligase, whereas the E3 activity of other TRAFs (TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5) is not fully identified [8\u201310]. TRAF6, a non-conventional E3 ubiquitin ligase, attracts significant attention as the most studied TRAF member, differing from other TRAFs participating in the signal transduction of both the TNF receptor and the IL-1/TLR family proteins. TRAF6 is capable of activating a cascade of signaling events and upstream kinases, including kappa-B kinase (IKK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, (MAPK) resulting in the stimulation of transcription factors including interferon-regulatory factor (IRF), the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and activator protein-1 (AP1) families [11\u201315]. In particular, NF-\u03baB regulates the expression of a variety of genes involved in inflammatory responses, proliferation, differentiation, migration, cell adhesion, and apoptosis. Thus, NF-\u03baB dysfunction can increase cancer cell proliferation and hamper apoptosis [16\u201318]. Moreover, TRAF6 has been reported to enhance the ubiquitination and activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and transforming growth factor activated kinase 1 (TAK1), leading to cell cycle progression, proliferation, and migration of cancer cells along with impairment of apoptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, the overexpression of TRAF6 is linked with inflammatory disorders and various types of cancers including pancreatic, liver, lung, head and neck, breast, colorectal, prostate, melanoma, and osteosarcoma [19\u201324]. On the other hand, it has also been reported that TRAF6 serves important roles in osteoclastogenesis, defective lymph node organogenesis, and hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia [15,25]. Recent studies also documented that high levels of TRAF6 were observed in serum patients with autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and myasthenia gravis [26]. Separately, the connection between upregulation and/or accumulation of TRAF6 and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been reported since TRAF6 triggers neuronal apoptosis and central nervous system (CNS) disruption. In CNS, TRAF6 also contributes to inflammatory responses in stroke and neuropathic pain [27\u201330]. In this study, we investigated the N-terminal region of TRAF6 at atomic resolution to examine the structure. We designed 503 new compounds on the basis of SN-1, which was previously synthesized by our group and was determined to bind to TRAF6 decreasing long-chain poly-ubiquitination [31,32]. After we determined the structure (PDB ID: 8HZ2), we conducted molecular docking studies for our 503 new SN-1 derivatives using this tem-\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1608 3 of 20\nplate (PDB ID: 8HZ2) [33] compared to SN-1 and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for three favorable docked complexes. We also conducted absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) analysis to detect the most promising candidates with optimum pharmacokinetic profiles. Our findings have important implications for further pharmaceutical studies, particularly for the development of next-generation TRAF6 inhibitors to be effective as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-osteoporosis, immunosuppressant or anti-neurodegenerative agents."

            "text": "TRAF6 is widely distributed in the brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney and is involved in a great number of immune and inflammatory reactions as a characteristic E3 ubiquitin ligase. TRAF6 plays a pivotal role in NF-\u03baB stimulation, which triggers a vast array of cellular and organismal processes such as development, immunity, tissue homeostasis and inflammation regulating gene expression, apoptosis, and proliferation at molecular and cellular levels. Therefore, TRAF6 is associated with diverse abnormalities including different cancer types, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory diseases [48\u201350]. Having access to the structural details of TRAF6 provides insights that can support the development of new-generation anticancer therapeutics. Furthermore, the previously deposited structure used as a model (PDB ID: 3HCS) serves as a reference point from which we can observe that our structure is highly similar. The most significant characteristic of TRAF6 is the zinc interaction. Bivalent ions provide a structural scaffold around where the zinc fingers and the RING domain folds. Therefore, zinc has an important role in TRAF6 function, and altering the zinc interaction is a good starting point for inhibition. The overall structure of the TRAF6 N-terminal region shows the dimerized structure with zinc atoms at the center of each domain. The domain organization shows, in addition to RING domain and zinc fingers, a linker region, consisting of a single helix (Figure 3). This region has a role in N-terminal dimerization, as a phenylalanine residue here is part of the dimerization surface. RING domain and zinc fingers were analyzed in detail. Zinc fingers are one of the most abundant structural motifs observed in proteins [51]. As their name suggests, they are characterized around a bivalent zinc ion and they can interact with a wide range of molecules, such as nucleic acids and other proteins. Therefore, zinc finger proteins have a wide variety of functions, from transcriptional regulation to actin targeting. Zinc fingers have common patterns: for example, they consist mainly of cysteine and histidine residues, in different ratios [52]. Classical zinc fingers have two of each (Cys2His2); however, some cases show differences. Zinc finger domains have two \u03b2-sheets and one \u03b1-helix, although the number of loops change depending on the protein. RING domain is a common domain in ubiquitin-ligase proteins (E3), with over 340 such proteins possessing this domain. It interacts with two bivalent zinc ions, forming RING fingers [53]. RING domains interact with DNA; therefore, the proteins including RING domain could mediate DNA transcription. The presented structure has a RING domain and three zinc fingers. Each zinc finger follows a conserved pattern: Sheet-LoopSheet-Helix-Loop. Moreover, each zinc finger has the same residue pattern: two cysteine residues in the first loop, one histidine residue in the helix, and a third cysteine residue in the second loop. This is an expected result, as the zinc fingers fold around bivalent zinc ions, and they possess similar patterns. This is a classical zinc finger pattern in a way that it has two sheets and a helix; however, it differs as classical zinc finger in its Cys2His2 structure. We have also investigated the distances between the zinc-interacting residues and the zinc ion. We observed that the distances are well within the range of strong bond formation at up to 2.4 \u00c5. The cysteine residues interact with the zinc through the sulfur at the side chain while the histidines interact through their side chain nitrogens. We compared the distances in three zinc fingers, and we observed that they are similar as well, further showing that the zinc fingers have common characteristics. Moreover, it is confirmed that our structure has a RING finger, with its two bivalent zinc ions presenting thus, forming a RING domain. This domain mediates DNA interaction, and is crucial for the role of TRAF6 on NF-\u03baB regulation. These four domains, all revolving around the central zinc atom, are great targets for TRAF6 therapeutics. The high number of cysteine residues results in disulfide bond formation, in addition to zinc interaction; therefore, altering these bonds with reducing agents (for example, dithiol compounds) will go a long way in modulating TRAF6 function.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1608 13 of 20\nStructural alignment with the model protein was performed. We used a deposited structure (PDB ID: 3HCS) as a model, and aligned it to the obtained structure (Figure 6). We observed that the structures aligned with high similarity (RMSD = 1.09), except for the loops. This is expected as loops are generally flexible, and the difference is based on the natural properties of the protein. We have also looked into the RING domain and zinc fingers in detail. We observed that the distances between zinc-interacting residues and zinc ions are very similar to that of obtained structure (PDB ID: 8HZ2), ranging between 2.1 and 2.8 \u00c5. This is an expected result as the zinc fingers are conserved regions further confirmed by these distances. We also applied molecular docking assessment for 503 new SN-1 derivatives. These new compounds were rationally designed for mimicking the binding effects of SN-1, which was previously synthesized and confirmed by our research group to bind to N-terminal region of TRAF6. We also observed that SN-1 and new derivatives presented the similar interactions with our previous study [31] such as hydrogen bonding with His141 and His151 residues and ionic bonding with zinc ion. This similarity confirmed the significance of certain residues in the binding site. Although new compounds revealed similar binding profile with SN-1 (Figure 8A,B), they showed less affinity compared to SN-1 associated with docking scores (Table 1). Among these derivatives, compounds 256, 322, and 489 were found to bind to TRAF6 more effectively through hydrogen bonding with His141, both \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen bonding with His151 and salt-bridge formation with zinc ion These derivatives were designed following different strategies based on the fact that pyridine and amino groups in acyl chains were found critical for binding affinity. The docking assessment on these 503 new derivatives at the N-terminal region of TRAF6 (PDB ID: 8HZ2) supported our previous data. In general, the carboxylate, sulfonamide, and dithiocarbamate groups established salt-bridge formation with zinc ion as similar with the thiol group of SN-1. The replacement of dimethylaminogroup with the other groups did not make a huge impact in binding capacity of new derivatives. The \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with His151 also played important roles in binding potential of compounds 256, 322 and 489. The RMSD plot after MD simulations tells us the average changes in the positions of atoms with respect to a reference frame. At the end of 300 ns MD simulations, compound 322-TRAF6 complex did not stabilize and the ligand was observed to diffuse away from the binding site. The RMSD plots for the 256/TRAF6 and 489/TRAF6 complexes are shown in Figure 10. In both cases, relatively high RMSD values are observed. Compound 256-/TRAF6 complex stabilizes after 200 ns and fluctuations are mostly within 2 \u00c5. Compound 489-/TRAF6 complex, on the other hand, reaches equilibrium after ~105 ns and remains relatively stable until the end of simulation. Visual inspection at the trajectories revealed that the relatively large RMSD values could be explained by fluctuations in the zinc finger regions of the protein that possessed a significant flexibility adopting different conformations. The ring domain and the binding site underwent much fewer fluctuations. We believe that such initial conformational changes were induced by the ligands upon binding. During reorganization and partial folding of the zinc finger regions, both ligands remained in the binding site. The ADME calculation results signified that all compounds possessed moderate druglikeness profiles with appropriate water solubility and lipophilicity values. As the human serum albumin binding is directly related to the volume of distribution and half-life of drugs, it can be concluded that all compounds showed adequate human serum albumin binding values. Although compounds revealed QPlogBB values in the limits, they failed to penetrate into the brain according to BOILED-Egg chart of Swiss ADME. Compounds exerted no inhibition against all tested CYP enzymes indicating a lower risk for drug\u2013drug interactions. However, some compounds were found as P-gp substrates increasing the possibility of resistance by tumor cell lines through efflux. Compound 256 revealed the most prominent ADME values with optimum properties along with high GI absorption implying its drug-likeness potential.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1608 14 of 20"

Therefore, it has been found that TRAF6 is overexpressed in various types of cancer including pancreatic, liver, lung, head and neck, breast, colorectal cancers, and melanoma along with inflammatory, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, examining and knowing the accurate protein structure can guide us in understanding the exact mechanism of action. The current research manifested the characteristics of the RING domain organization and zinc-binding of TRAF6, shedding light on the crucial functions of the protein. This study encouraged us to carry out further molecular docking studies with TRAF6 and new SN-1 derivatives based on the fact that SN-1 is a potential TRAF6 inhibitor developed by our research group. Results showed that in particular methylsulfonyl and carboxylate carrying compound 256 showed remarkable binding efficacy to the N-terminal region of TRAF6. MD simulations revealed that compound 322 did not form a stable complex while compounds 256 and 489 had favorable bindings with TRAF6. Compound 256 also exhibited appropriate pharmakinetic profile making it as a potential drug-like TRAF6 inhibitor. Overall, the results of this study will lead us for further structural studies including SN-1 and most effective SN-1 derivatives. Based on our continuous endeavors, we aim to develop TRAF6-specific drug candidates to be effective against various disorders.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ph16111608/s1, Figure S1: A close up of zinc-binding pockets in aligned structure.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, O.G., R.K., H.C. and H.D.; methodology, O.G., H.C., B.S., F.B.-\u00dc., A.E. and H.D.; software, O.G, B.S., F.B.-\u00dc., A.E., H.C. and H.D.; validation, O.G., H.C., B.S., F.B.-\u00dc., A.E. and H.D.; formal analysis, O.G., H.C. and H.D.; investigation, O.G., B.S., F.B.-\u00dc., A.E., J.-i.I., H.C. and H.D.; resources, O.G., H.C. and H.D.; data curation, O.G., B.S., F.B.-\u00dc., A.E., H.C. and H.D; writing\u2014original draft preparation, O.G, B.S., F.B.-\u00dc., A.E., H.C. and H.D; writing\u2014review and editing, O.G., B.S., F.B.-\u00dc., A.E., H.T., R.K., M.O.R., N.D., M.C., M.D.A., J.-i.I., M.O., M.F., H.C. and H.D.; visualization, O.G., B.S., F.B.-\u00dc., A.E., H.C. and H.D.; supervision, H.C. and H.D.; project administration, H.C. and H.D.; funding acquisition, H.C. and H.D.
