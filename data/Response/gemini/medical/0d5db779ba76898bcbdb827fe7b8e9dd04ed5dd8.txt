1. **Investigate the use of novel nanocarriers for dsRNA delivery in plants.** 
This could include exploring the use of nanocarriers made from different materials, such as graphene oxide or metal-organic frameworks, or investigating the use of nanocarriers with different surface modifications to improve their stability and targeting ability.


2. **Develop methods to improve the systemic delivery of dsRNA in plants.** 
This could involve investigating the use of different application methods, such as high-pressure spraying or vacuum infiltration, or exploring the use of nanocarriers that can facilitate the movement of dsRNA through plant tissues.


3. **Investigate the potential risks and safety concerns associated with the use of dsRNA sprays in agriculture.** 
This could include studying the effects of dsRNA sprays on non-target organisms, such as beneficial insects and soil microorganisms, or investigating the potential for dsRNA sprays to accumulate in the environment.


4. **Develop methods to reduce the cost of dsRNA production.** 
This could involve investigating the use of alternative production methods, such as microbial fermentation or cell-free transcription, or exploring the use of dsRNA analogs that are less expensive to produce.


5. **Conduct field trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dsRNA sprays in different agricultural settings.** 
This could involve testing dsRNA sprays against a variety of pests and diseases in different crops, and evaluating the effects of dsRNA sprays on yield and quality.
