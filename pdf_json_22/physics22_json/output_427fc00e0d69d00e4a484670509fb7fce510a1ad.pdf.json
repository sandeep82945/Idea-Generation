    "abstractText": "Measurements of single-, double-, and triple-differential cross-sections are presented for boosted top-quark pair-production in 13 TeV proton\u2013proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The top quarks are observed through their hadronic decay and reconstructed as large-radius jets with the leading jet having transverse momentum (pT) greater than 500GeV. The observed data are unfolded to remove detector effects. The particle-level cross-section, multiplied by the tt\u0304 \u2192 WWbb\u0304 branching fraction and measured in a fiducial phase space defined by requiring the leading and second-leading jets to have pT > 500GeV and pT > 350GeV, respectively, is 331\u00b1 3(stat.)\u00b1 39(syst.) fb. This is approximately 20% lower than the prediction of 398+48 \u221249 fb by Powheg+Pythia 8 with next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy but consistent within the theoretical uncertainties. Results are also presented at the parton level, where the effects of top-quark decay, parton showering, and hadronization are removed such that they can be compared with fixed-order next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) calculations. The partonlevel cross-section, measured in a fiducial phase space similar to that at particle level, is 1.94\u00b1 0.02(stat.)\u00b1 0.25(syst.) pb. This agrees with the NNLO prediction of 1.96+0.02 \u22120.17 pb. Reasonable agreement with the differential cross-sections is found for most NLO models, while the NNLO calculations are generally in better agreement with the data. The differential cross-sections are interpreted using a Standard Model effective field-theory formalism and limits are set on Wilson coefficients of several four-fermion operators.",

            "text": "The large top-quark pair-production cross-section at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) results in high-statistics samples of top-quark\u2013top-antiquark (tt\u0304) pairs that enable unique tests of the Standard Model (SM) and searches for new phenomena that affect tt\u0304 production. A focus on final states with highly boosted top quarks probes the QCD tt\u0304 production processes at the TeV scale, a kinematic region where theoretical calculations based on the SM still have large uncertainties [1\u20133]. High-precision measurements constrain these predictions, especially at tt\u0304 invariant masses of 2 TeV or more. Furthermore, effects beyond the SM may appear as deviations of tt\u0304 differential distributions from the SM prediction [4\u20136].\nIn the SM, the top quark decays almost exclusively into a W boson and a b-quark. The signature of a tt\u0304 final state is therefore determined by the W boson decay modes. The ATLAS [7\u201315] and CMS [16\u201329] collaborations have published measurements of the tt\u0304 differential cross-sections at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 TeV, 8 TeV, and 13 TeV\nin proton\u2013proton (pp) collisions using final states containing leptons and jets, with most measurements employing the lepton+jets or dilepton channels. The analysis presented here makes use of the all-hadronic tt\u0304 decay mode, where only top-quark candidates with high transverse momentum (pT) being reconstructed as jets are selected. This highly boosted topology has advantages over other final states since the Lorentz boost of the top quark collimates its decay products such that they can be collected into a large-radius (large-R) jet. Although this final state has the largest branching ratio and the absence of neutrinos from W decays allows direct detection of all decay products, it is also less studied given the large backgrounds coming from multijet production [15, 28]. These features make measurements of the all-hadronic final state complementary to studies of the lepton+jets and dilepton channels.\nThis analysis is performed by targeting events where the leading top-quark jet has p t,1T > 500 GeV and the second-leading top-quark jet has p t,2 T > 350 GeV. These jets are reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits and tagged as top-quark candidates to separate the tt\u0304 final state from background sources. The top-quark-tagging algorithm uses high-level jet-substructure information as input to a deep neural network (DNN) that efficiently discriminates between top-quark jets resulting from hadronic top-quark decay and the various backgrounds [30, 31]. Moreover, the jets containing b-hadrons coming from hadronization of b-quarks from top-quark decays are identified using another DNN that exploits information from large-impact-parameter tracks, the topological decay chain and the displaced vertices of b-hadron decays [32, 33]. The event selection and background estimation follows the approach used in ref. [34], but with a fourfold increase in sample size, improved tagging methods [30\u201333, 35], and more precise background estimates.\nThese measurements utilise data collected by the ATLAS detector between 2015 and 2018 from pp collisions at \u221a s = 13TeV, referred to as Run 2, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\u22121. The tt\u0304 differential cross-sections are measured by unfolding the detector-level distributions to a particle-level fiducial phase-space region and a partonlevel fiducial phase-space region. The particle-level criteria intend to match the kinematic requirements used for the detector-level selection of the tt\u0304 events while the parton-level\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\nregion is defined by making the same cuts on the pT of the leading and second-leading top quark as at the detector-level. Unfolding the observed distributions to distributions of variables directly related to the detector observables in a particle-level fiducial phase space allow for precision tests of QCD, as the particle-level results can be compared with Monte Carlo (MC) generator predictions that implement matrix-element calculations at next-toleading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant \u03b1s, leading-order (LO) models for top-quark decay, and parton-shower and hadronization models. This procedure avoids model-dependent extrapolation of the measurements to a phase-space region outside the detector acceptance. The size of the phase space nonetheless is large enough to allow robust tests of the QCD predictions. Parton-level differential cross-sections are also presented, where the detector-level distributions are unfolded to measure the top-quark kinematics at the parton level in a larger phase-space region, allowing measurement of the QCD process factoring out the parton showering and hadronization of the quarks and gluons. These allow comparisons with next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) predictions for which matching to a parton-shower algorithm is not yet available. Here and in what follows, the cross-sections and distributions created using MC generators are referred to as calculations or predictions, while distributions created using MC events passed through the detector simulation and event reconstruction are referred to as simulations.\nThe modelling of differential cross-sections are affected by the models for initial- and final-state radiation (ISR and FSR), parton distribution functions (PDFs), and the scheme for matching matrix-element calculations to parton-shower models. Their measurement therefore tests the NLO QCD predictions for these aspects.\nMeasurements of the differential cross-sections for the leading and second-leading top quarks are made as a function of their pT and rapidity y. In addition, the differential cross-sections for the transverse momentum (ptT) and absolute rapidity (|yt|) of a top quark chosen at random from the event are measured. These are equivalent to the average of the top-quark and top-antiquark distributions and are typically easier to compare with fixedorder predictions and measurements in other channels than kinematic distributions of the leading or second-leading jet. The rapidities of the leading and second-leading top quarks in the laboratory frame are denoted by y t,1 and y t,2, respectively, while their rapidities in the tt\u0304 centre-of-mass frame are y? = 1/2 ( y t,1 \u2212 y t,2 ) and \u2212y?. These allow the construction\nof the observable \u03c7tt\u0304 = exp(2|y?|), which is of particular interest since many phenomena not included in the SM, such as quark substructure, are predicted to peak at low values of \u03c7tt\u0304 [36]. The longitudinal motion of the tt\u0304 system in the laboratory frame is described by the rapidity boost ytt\u0304B = 1/2 ( y t,1 + y t,2 ) and is sensitive to PDFs. The unfolded distributions for the tt\u0304 invariant mass (mtt\u0304), transverse momentum (ptt\u0304T), and absolute value of rapidity ( \u2223\u2223\u2223ytt\u0304\u2223\u2223\u2223) are constructed, as these test QCD predictions and are sensitive to processes beyond the SM (BSM processes). Measurements of the differential cross-sections are also performed as a function of the absolute value of the azimuthal angle between the two top quarks,\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2206\u03c6tt\u0304\u2223\u2223\u2223; the absolute value of the out-of-plane momentum, \u2223\u2223\u2223ptt\u0304out\u2223\u2223\u2223 (i.e. the projection of the three-momentum of the second-leading top quark onto the direction perpendicular to a plane defined by the leading top quark and the beam axis (z) in the laboratory frame [37]); the cosine of the production angle in the Collins\u2013Soper reference frame [38], cos \u03b8?; and the\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\nscalar sum of the transverse momenta of the two top quarks, Htt\u0304T [39, 40]. Several doubleand triple-differential cross-sections employing pairs and triplets of these observables are measured to provide information about correlations. These are particularly sensitive to QCD modelling and have been shown to constrain PDFs [21, 26].\nThese measurements are compared with different QCD predictions. Direct comparisons of the differential cross-sections incorporating statistical and systematic uncertainties identify the predictions that are in best agreement with the data. Measurements unfolded to the particle-level fiducial phase space and parton-level fiducial phase space are compared with QCD predictions at NLO produced by the Powheg Box v2 [41\u201344] and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [45] programs. Measurements unfolded to the parton-level fiducial phase space are compared with a NNLO calculation implemented in the Matrix program [46\u201348]. Other NNLO calculations for tt\u0304 production exist [1, 49\u201351] but are not publicly available to make predictions in the phase space and/or final state employed in these measurements.\nThe unfolded distributions are also used to set constraints on the magnitude of particle couplings beyond the SM using the SM effective field theory (SMEFT) that extends the SM by adding higher-order dimension operators suppressed by the scale of the new physics that respect the Lorentz and gauge invariance and other assumed basic symmetries [52]. Using a LO SMEFT model that incorporates a full list of dimension-6 operators involved in top-quark interactions [53], limits are set on a subset of Wilson coefficients and on selected pairs of these coefficients. These can be related to the couplings and production of massive particles beyond the SM.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the ATLAS detector, while section 3 describes the data and simulation samples used in the measurements. The reconstruction of lepton and jet candidates, and the event selection based on these, is explained in section 4 and the background estimates are discussed in section 5. The detector-level results are presented in section 6. The procedure for particle-level and parton-level unfolding is described in section 7. The systematic uncertainties affecting the measurements are summarized in section 8. The results of the measurements are presented in section 9 and the discussion and the interpretation of these results is made in section 10. The results of the analysis using the SMEFT formalism are presented in section 11. Conclusions of this study are summarized in section 12."

The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis.

It is followed by the silicon microstrip tracker, which usually provides eight measurements per track. These silicon detectors are complemented by the transition radiation tracker, which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to |\u03b7| = 2.0.\nThe calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 4.9. Within the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, electromagnetic calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering |\u03b7| < 1.8 to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. Hadron calorimetry is provided by the steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadron endcap calorimeters. The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules optimized for electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements, respectively.\nThe muon spectrometer (MS) comprises separate trigger and high-precision tracking chambers measuring the deflection of muons in a magnetic field generated by the superconducting air-core toroidal magnets. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T m across most of the detector. A set of precision chambers covers the region |\u03b7| < 2.7 with three layers of monitored drift tubes, complemented by cathode-strip chambers in the forward region, where the background is highest. The muon trigger system covers the range |\u03b7| < 2.4 with resistive-plate chambers in the barrel, and thin-gap chambers in the endcap regions.\nInteresting events are selected by the first-level trigger system implemented in custom hardware, followed by selections made by algorithms implemented in software in the highlevel trigger [57]. The first-level trigger accepts events from the 40 MHz bunch crossings at a rate below 100 kHz, which the high-level trigger further reduces in order to record events to disk at about 1 kHz. An extensive software suite [58] is used in the reconstruction and analysis of real and simulated data, in detector operations, and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment."

Only data taken under stable beam conditions with fully operational subdetectors are considered [59]. The events for this analysis were collected using an inclusive jet trigger employing anti-kt [60] reconstruction with radius parameter R = 1.0 and nominal pT thresholds of 360 GeV in 2015, 420 GeV in 2016, and 460 GeV in 2017 and 2018. Moreover, single-jet and double-jet triggers with lower pT thresholds and jet-mass requirements of >40 GeV and >35 GeV were used in 2017 and 2018, respectively. These triggers are fully efficient for jets with pT > 500 GeV [57].\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\nThe signal and several background processes were modelled using MC generators. The effect of multiple interactions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings (pile-up) was modelled by overlaying the simulated hard-scattering event with inelastic pp events generated with Pythia 8.186 [61] using the NNPDF2.3lo set of PDFs [62] and the A3 set of tuned parameters [63]. The detector response was simulated using the Geant4 framework [64, 65]. The data and MC events are reconstructed with the same software algorithms.\nSeveral NLO calculations of the tt\u0304 process are used to generate the simulated events and in comparisons with the measured differential cross-sections. The Powheg Box v2 [41\u201344] and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [45] (hereafter referred to as aMC@NLO) MC generators encode different approaches to the matrix-element calculation and different matching schemes between the NLO QCD matrix-element (ME) calculation and the parton-shower (PS) algorithm. Unless explicitly noted below, the following generator set-ups were used. The employed PDF set is NNPDF3.0nlo [66]. Parton showering and hadronization was performed with Pythia 8.230 [67] using the A14 set of tuned parameters [68] and the NNPDF2.3lo set of PDFs. The top-quark mass was set to mtop = 172.5 GeV for all samples with the top quark in the final state and the renormalization and factorization scales were set to \u00b5r/f = \u221a m2top + p2T for all tt\u0304 samples, where pT is the transverse momentum of the top quark. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were simulated using the EvtGen 1.6.0 program [69].\nThe nominal sample used the Powheg Box v2 generator at NLO in QCD. The hdamp parameter, which controls the matching in the Powheg calculation and effectively regulates the high-pT radiation against which the tt\u0304 system recoils, was set to 1.5mtop [70]. To increase the available statistics for events with high-pT top quarks, multiple samples were generated with different ranges of the total scalar sum of pT in the event. An alternative matrix-element calculation and matching with the parton shower was realized with the aMC@NLO 2.6.0 generator. Top quarks were decayed at LO using the MadSpin program [71, 72] to preserve spin correlations. The parton-shower starting scale has the functional form \u00b5q = HT/2 [73], where HT is defined as the scalar sum of the pT of all outgoing partons. An alternative Powheg+Pythia 8 sample with the Powheg parameter hdamp set to 3mtop was used to assess part of the ISR systematic uncertainty [74]. An additional Powheg+Pythia 8 sample was generated with the matrix-element correction turned off in order to assess the systematic uncertainty due to this change in the matrix-element calculation. The effects of using alternative parton-shower and hadronization models were probed by combining the nominal Powheg set-up with the Herwig 7.1.3 parton-shower and hadronization model [75, 76], using the Herwig 7.1 default set of tuned parameters [76, 77] and the MMHT2014lo PDF set [78].\nSingle-top-quark production in association with a W boson (tW ) was modelled by the Powheg Box v2 generator at NLO using the five-flavour scheme. The diagram-removal scheme [79] was used to remove interference and overlap with tt\u0304 production. Electroweak t-channel single-top-quark events were modelled using Powheg Box v2 [80] at NLO in the four-flavour scheme. The electroweak s-channel single-top-quark process was not modelled explicitly, owing to its small cross-section and its negligible contribution after the event\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\nselection described in section 4. Its remaining contribution is largely accounted for in the data-driven background estimate. The associated production of tt\u0304 and a Higgs boson (tt\u0304H) was modelled by the Powheg Box v2 [81] generator at NLO. The associated production of tt\u0304 and a W or Z boson (tt\u0304V ) was modelled using the aMC@NLO 2.3.3 generator at NLO. Parton showering and hadronization was performed by the Pythia 8.210 generator. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were simulated using the EvtGen 1.2.0 program.\nThe tt\u0304 samples are normalized to the cross-section prediction at NNLO in QCD including the resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft-gluon terms calculated using the Top++ 2.0 program [82\u201388]. For pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV, this cross-section corresponds to \u03c3(tt\u0304)NNLO+NNLL = 832\u00b1 51 pb using a top-quark mass of mtop = 172.5GeV. The uncertainties in the cross-section due to the PDFs and \u03b1s are calculated using the PDF4LHC15 prescription [89] with the MSTW2008nnlo [90, 91], CT10nnlo [92, 93], and NNPDF2.3lo PDF sets in the fiveflavour scheme, and are added in quadrature to the effect of the scale uncertainty.\nCalculations of tt\u0304 production at NNLO matched to the parton shower to produce particle-level predictions are not yet available for the all-hadronic final state. In order to evaluate the impact of NNLO corrections, the MC set-ups are reweighted at parton level. The reweighting is performed on the three variables: ptT, mtt\u0304, and ptt\u0304T, using the kinematics of the top-quarks in the MC samples after ISR and FSR. The predictions for ptT and mtt\u0304 are calculated at NNLO in QCD with NLO EW corrections [1] with the NNPDF3.0QED PDF set using the dynamic renormalisation and factorisation scales mT(t)/2 for ptT and Htt\u0304T/4 for mtt\u0304 as proposed in ref. [1]. The prediction for ptt\u0304T is calculated at NNLO in QCD [46\u201348] with the NNPDF3.0 PDF set using renormalisation and factorisation scales Htt\u0304T/4. All the predictions use mtop = 173.3GeV, a value 0.8 GeV larger than the nominal samples. It was verified that the changes in the predicted distributions due to the different choice of mtop are negligible. The reweighting has been derived iteratively [94], such that at the end of the procedure the reweighted MC sample is in good agreement with the highorder prediction for each of the three variables. These samples are referred to as being reweighted to the NNLO prediction in the remainder of the paper.\nThe single-top-quark tW cross-section is normalized to the calculation at NLO with NNLL soft-gluon corrections [95, 96]. The single-top-quark t-channel cross-section is normalized to the NLO calculation with the Hathor 2.1 program [97, 98]. The predicted values at \u221a s = 13 TeV are 136.02+5.40\u22124.57 pb, 80.95 +4.06 \u22123.61 pb, and 71.7 \u00b1 3.8 pb for t-channel top-quark production, t-channel top-antiquark production, and tW production, respectively. The cross-sections for tt\u0304 production in association with a Z, W , or Higgs boson are normalized to the NLO QCD + NLO electroweak predictions as calculated by the aMC@NLO generator and reported in ref. [99]. The predicted values at \u221a s = 13 TeV are 0.88+0.09\u22120.11 pb, 0.60 +0.08 \u22120.07 pb, and 0.51 +0.04 \u22120.05 pb, respectively. Comparisons with the measured differential cross-sections at parton level use a calculation of tt\u0304 production at QCD NNLO precision by the Matrix program [46\u201348], which provides differential tt\u0304 predictions in the full and fiducial phase space. For the nominal Matrix prediction, the top-quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV and the NNPDF3.1nnlo PDFs are employed with \u03b1s(mZ) = 0.118 set in the calculations [100], together with\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\nrenormalization and factorization dynamical scales of \u00b5r = \u00b5f = HT/2, where HT =\u221a m2top + p2T,t + \u221a m2top + p2T,t\u0304. For the alternative predictions, the dynamical scales are defined by \u00b5r = \u00b5f = HT/4 and \u00b5r = \u00b5f = mtt\u0304/2, and the CT18nnlo [101] and MMHT2014nnlo [78] PDFs are used. A seven-point scale variation is used to obtain the effect of the scale uncertainty by varying the renormalization and factorization scales by a factor of two around their central value with the constraint 0.5 \u2264 \u00b5f/\u00b5r \u2264 2. The largest upward and downward changes from the central-value result are taken as positive and negative uncertainties, respectively."

A tight likelihood-based requirement is used to reject fake-electron candidates, and calorimeter- and track-based isolation requirements are imposed [102].\nMuon candidates are reconstructed using high-quality inner-detector tracks combined with tracks reconstructed in the muon spectrometer. Only muon candidates satisfying \u2018medium\u2019 identification criteria [103], with pT > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, are considered. Isolation criteria similar to those used for electrons are imposed [103]. To reduce the impact of non-prompt leptons, muons within \u2206R = 0.4 of a small-R jet, as defined below, are removed.\nThe anti-kt [60] and variable-R [104] algorithms implemented in the FastJet package [105] are used to define three types of jets for this analysis: large-R jets with fixed R = 1.0 [106], small-R jets with fixed R = 0.4 used to investigate the internal kinematics of the large-R jets, and variable-R jets with a pT-dependent variable-radius parameter, ranging between R = 0.02 and R = 0.4 [104, 107], which are used to identify b-hadrons. These are reconstructed independently of each other. The large-R jets are formed from topological clusters in the calorimeter calibrated using the local calibration method described in ref. [108], while the small-R jets are reconstructed from both calorimeter energy clusters and charged-particle tracks. The variable-R jets are reconstructed from innerdetector tracks that are used as input to the clustering algorithm. Only variable-R jets that have |\u03b7| < 2.5 and pT > 10 GeV are considered. Small-R jets with pT < 60 GeV are required to have charged-particle tracks matched to the primary interaction vertex [109].\nVariable-R jets containing b-hadrons are identified (b-tagged) using a DNN that exploits information from large-impact-parameter tracks, the topological decay chain and the\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\ndisplaced vertices of b-hadron decays [32, 33]. The variable-R jets are considered b-tagged if the value of the discriminant is larger than a threshold that provides 77% efficiency as measured in inclusive tt\u0304 events. The b-tagging efficiency observed in the boosted top-quark jets employed in this analysis is found to be \u223c70%, which arises from the increased collimation and charged-particle track density in the top-quark jets. The corresponding rejection factors for gluon/light-quark jets and charm-quark jets are approximately 300 and 7, respectively, as measured in inclusive tt\u0304 events. The variable-R jets are associated with the large-R jets using a ghost-matching algorithm [110, 111], which identifies those variable-R jets that are contained within or are in proximity to the large-R jet. A large-R jet with at least one associated b-tagged variable-R jet is considered b-tagged.\nThe large-R and small-R jet energy and mass scales are corrected by using energyand \u03b7-dependent calibration factors derived from simulation and in situ measurements [112, 113]. The large-R jet candidates are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.0, 200 GeV < pT < 3000 GeV, and jet mass >50 GeV, where \u03b7 is used instead of rapidity for selection at the detector level because the jet calibrations were determined as a function of \u03b7. The \u2019combined jet mass\u2019 [112], which uses both the information from the calorimeter and the tracking system to measure the jet mass, is used to define the large-R-jet mass. A trimming algorithm [114] with parameters Rsub = 0.2 and fcut = 0.05 is applied to the large-R jets to suppress gluon radiation and mitigate pile-up effects.\nThe top-quark tagging of large-R jets relies on a DNN that uses jet-substructure variables such as the jet mass and measures of energy flow as input [30, 31]. The pT-dependent requirements on the DNN score provide 80% top-quark-tagging efficiency across the full jet-pT range, as measured in inclusive tt\u0304 events where the top-quark decay products are contained within the large-R jet. The algorithm has a light-quark and gluon jet-rejection factor that is pT-dependent, being \u223c15 at pT = 500 GeV and decreasing to \u223c12 at pT = 1 TeV, as measured in multijet events."

In order to reject top-quark events where a top quark has decayed semileptonically, the events are required to contain no reconstructed electron or muon candidates.

The first contribution, referred to as multijet background and where the two leading jets both arise from gluons or lighter quarks, is found to be the largest background. Because the uncertainties in MC predictions of this background are large [115, 116], it is estimated using a data-driven approach. A similar method was used in previous work [15, 34].

Sixteen separate regions are defined by classifying each event in the preselection sample according to whether the leading and second-leading jets are top-quark-tagged or b-tagged. Table 1 shows the 16 regions that are defined in this way, and indicates the expected proportion of tt\u0304 signal events and MC-predicted background events relative to the number of data events in each region. These fractions illustrate the size of the MC-predicted subtractions in each region when calculating the data-driven multijet-background estimates. Region S is the signal region, while the regions with at most two tags that are either toptags or b-tags (A\u2013J, O) are dominated by multijet background and serve as control regions. Regions with three tags (K, L, N and M) have an expected contribution from top-quark\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\npairs of at least 20% of the observed yield and are validation regions. In other regions, the expected contribution from signal and MC-predicted backgrounds is <10% of the number of observed events. The asymmetry in the signal contribution in the regions of the table where the tagging states of the leading and second-leading jet are interchanged is due to the interplay of several factors, such as the pT- and jet-mass dependence of top-quark-tagging and b-tagging efficiencies.\nThe estimated contributions of the tt\u0304 signal and the MC-predicted backgrounds are subtracted from each control region, ignoring the small s-channel single-top-quark contribution. This provides an estimate of the number of multijet events in each control region. The number of multijet events in region J divided by the number of multijet events in region A gives an estimate of the ratio of the number of multijet events in region S to the number of multijet events in region O, since the events in different regions in a given ratio always differ only by the top-quark-tagging and b-tagging state of the second-leading large-R jet. These relationships are used to estimate the multijet-background rate in region S, i.e. S = (O\u00d7 J)/A, where O, J and A are the number of multijet events in each region, while S is the estimate of the number of multijet background events in region S.\nThis \u2018ABCD\u2019 estimate assumes that the mistagging rate of the leading jet does not depend on how the second-leading jet is tagged, but in practice there are correlations between the mistagging rates of the two large-R jet candidates. The primary source of such mistagging correlations is between top-quark-tagging and b-tagging in the same jet. These correlations are measured in the background-dominated regions, e.g. a comparison of the ratio of the numbers of events in regions F and E (representing the leading-jet topquark-mistagging rate when the second-leading jet is top-quark-tagged) with the ratio of the numbers of events in regions C and A (giving the leading-jet top-quark-mistagging rate when the second-leading jet is not top-quark-tagged) gives the correction factor due to the correlation between top-quark-mistagging states of the two large-R jets. This results in a data-driven estimate of the number of multijet background events in region S given by\nS = J \u00d7O A \u00b7 D \u00d7A B \u00d7 C \u00b7 G\u00d7A E \u00d7 I \u00b7 F \u00d7A E \u00d7 C \u00b7 H \u00d7A B \u00d7 I\n= J \u00d7O \u00d7H \u00d7 F \u00d7D \u00d7G\u00d7A 3\n(B \u00d7 E \u00d7 C \u00d7 I)2 , (5.1)\nwhere the italic letters again represent the number of observed events in that region after the subtraction of tt\u0304 signal events and the MC-predicted background events. The measured correlations result in a \u223c15% increase in the multijet estimate relative to the estimate which does not take into account these measured correlations. There is no significant jet-pT dependence of these correlations.\nThis background estimate depends on the assumed inclusive tt\u0304 cross-section, which is the NNLO+NNLL cross-section prediction described in section 3. However, it was found that even a 20% change in the assumed inclusive tt\u0304 cross-section would cause only \u223c1% change in the measured fiducial phase-space tt\u0304 cross-section, which is negligible compared to the uncertainty of the measurement.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\nThis background estimate, including the mistagging correlations, is made bin-by-bin in the observed distributions.

Similar studies of validation regions with varying correlations between tagging states demonstrate that the multijet-background estimates are robust. These distributions can also be compared with the signal-region distributions in figure 4, which illustrates the difference in the kinematics of the leading and second-leading large-R jets."

            "text": "The iterative Bayesian method [118] as implemented in RooUnfold [119] is used to correct the detector-level event distributions to their corresponding particle- and parton-level differential cross-sections. The unfolding starts from the observed differential distributions after subtraction of the estimated backgrounds.\nThe unfolding step for each observable uses a migration matrix (M) derived from simulated tt\u0304 events by binning the events in the particle-level (parton-level) fiducial phase space using the true value for the observable and subdividing the events in each particlelevel (parton-level) bin into bins of the detector-level observable. The resulting matrix, defined by the detector-level observable bins on the x-axis and the particle-level (partonlevel) bins on the y-axis, is normalized so that each row sums to unity, as shown in figure 6.\nThe bin widths are chosen by considering the measurement resolution of a given observable to achieve the migration matrix to be largely diagonal and that the unfolding procedure is stable, as determined by the stress tests described below. The migration matrices for the rapidity of the leading and second-leading top-quark candidates are the exceptions, where there are a small number of entries in very off-diagonal bins. This is due to cases where the two large-R jets swap order in pT when they evolve from the particle level or parton level to the detector level.\nThe efficiency corrections ieff correct for events that are in the particle-level (partonlevel) fiducial phase space but are not reconstructed at detector level.

Figure 7 shows the efficiency and acceptance corrections for the pT and rapidity of the leading jet. The variations in acceptance as a function of rapidity arise from transitions from one calorimeter system to another. The corrections for the other observables show similar behaviour except for observables sensitive to the relative orientation of the two top-quark jets: ptt\u0304T,\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2206\u03c6tt\u0304\u2223\u2223\u2223, and\u2223\u2223\u2223ptt\u0304out\u2223\u2223\u2223, which show modest decreases in acceptance.\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nThe unfolding procedure for an observable X at both particle- and parton-level is summarized by the heuristic expression\nd\u03c3fid dXi \u2261 1\u222b L dt \u00b7\u2206Xi \u00b7 1 ieff \u00b7 \u2211\nj\nM\u22121ij \u00b7 f j acc \u00b7 ( N jreco \u2212N j bg ) , (7.1)\nwhere N jreco and N j bg refer to the number of reconstructed signal and background events in\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\neach detector-level bin, respectively; the index j runs over bins of X at detector level while the index i labels bins at either particle or parton level; \u2206Xi is the bin width; and \u222b L dt is the integrated luminosity. The matrixM\u22121ij denotes the unfolding procedure and, strictly speaking, is not the inverse of the migration matrix defined earlier but is determined iteratively and has the effect of inverting the smearing resulting from the measurement process.\nThis unfolding procedure, expressed in eq. (7.1), is performed iteratively and regularizes the smoothness of the unfolded distribution. Studies of the performance of the algorithm using MC events show that four iterations provide unbiased, high-precision unfolded distributions for all observables. Other choices of the number of iterations between typically three to six provide similar results. The inclusive cross-section, \u03c3fid, for tt\u0304 events in the particle-level (parton-level) phase space, obtained by integrating the differential cross-section, is used to determine the normalized differential cross-section 1/\u03c3fid \u00b7 d\u03c3fid/dXi. The particle-level fiducial phase-space cross-section is not corrected for the all-hadronic tt\u0304 branching fraction of 0.457 [120]. This branching fraction is used to correct the parton-level fiducial phase-space cross-section measurement in order to facilitate a comparison with NNLO fixed-order predictions.\nTests are performed at both particle level and parton level to verify that the unfolding procedure recovers the generator-level distributions for detector-level distributions that vary from the nominal predictions. These tests include linear reweighting of the input distributions as a function of kinematic variables or reweighting based on possible data/prediction discrepancies. These stress tests show that the results of the unfolding procedure are unbiased as long as the variations in the input distributions are consistent with the measurement resolution of the observable. As part of the estimation of modelling systematic uncertainties, other tests are performed where the underlying model is changed, e.g., the parton-shower model or the top-quark mass. These are described in section 8."

            "text": "The systematic uncertainties of the measured distributions are estimated using simulation samples and the data satisfying the final selection requirements.\nA significant source of systematic uncertainty is the jet-energy scale (JES) for the largeR jets [112]. The small-R jet JES [113] does not contribute to the systematic uncertainties as these jets are not used in the event selection nor the unfolding procedures. Uncertainties in the jet energy resolution (JER) for large-R jets is also considered [112, 113]. The effect of correlations between the JES and JER systematic uncertainties is negligible in this analysis. The JES uncertainty results in a cross-section uncertainty that is typically of 4%\u20135% but\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\nreaches 12% for rapidity-related observables at large rapidity values. The JER uncertainty creates a cross-section uncertainty of 2%\u20135%.\nThe uncertainties in the large-R jet mass scale (JMS) and resolution (JMR) are derived from observations of theW boson and top-quark masses in semileptonic tt\u0304 events [112, 121], and by measuring the double ratio of data to MC simulation for calorimeter-only and trackonly quantities. The effect of the JMS uncertainty is typically around 1%\u20132%, while the effect of the JMR uncertainty is below 1%.\nThe efficiency to top-quark-tag large-R jets is corrected in simulated events by applying top-quark-tagging scale factors to account for a residual difference between data and simulation samples [30, 31]. The signal jets are required to be top-quark-tagged while other jets are labelled as background jets. Uncertainties in the rate of background jets were measured in two phase-space regions enriched in multijet and \u03b3+ jet processes. The signal-jet uncertainties were measured in boosted tt\u0304 lepton+jets events. Additional uncertainties are assigned to cover signal-modelling effects and extrapolation beyond the fiducial phase-space regions. The associated systematic uncertainties are computed by varying the top-quark-tagging scale factors within their uncertainties and are found to create differential cross-section uncertainties ranging from 7% to 10%.\nThe efficiency to tag variable-R jets containing b-hadrons is corrected in simulated events by applying b-tagging scale factors, extracted from tt\u0304 events, in order to account for residual tagging-efficiency differences between data and simulation [32, 33]. An additional uncertainty is included for the extrapolation of the measured uncertainties to the high-pT region of interest [122]. Its estimation is improved for the jets passing the event selection of this measurement by using the b-hadron pT spectrum corresponding to these jets. The systematic uncertainty is computed by varying the b-tagging scale factors within their uncertainties and is found to be 3%.\nThe cross-section uncertainties arising from the lepton energy scale, resolution, and identification efficiency are below 0.1% [102, 103].\nFor backgrounds estimated by MC simulation, the uncertainties in the predicted production cross-sections are included. An additional uncertainty of 50% is assigned to the Wt single-top-quark production cross-section to cover the large difference between the rates predicted by the diagram-removal [79] and diagram-subtraction [79] schemes in the boosted regime [123]. These schemes have different treatments of the overlap of the Wt-channel with tt\u0304 production. Systematic uncertainties affecting the multijet-background estimate come from the subtraction of other background processes in the control regions and from the uncertainties in the measured tagging correlations. The detector-related uncertainties which affect the MC-based background processes in the control regions used for the multijet-background estimates are directly accounted for in the above-mentioned detector systematic uncertainty categories. The remaining multijet-background uncertainties range from 1% to 6% for leading large-R jets with pT from 500 GeV to 2 TeV, respectively. Alternative MC generators are employed to assess modelling systematic uncertainties. In these cases, the difference between the unfolded distribution from an alternative model and its own particle-level or parton-level distribution is used as the estimate of the corresponding systematic uncertainty in the unfolded differential cross-section. The matrices from the nominal MC simulation are used in the unfolding.\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\nTo assess the uncertainty related to the matrix-element calculation and the partonshower matching procedure, aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 events are unfolded using the migration matrix and correction factors derived from the Powheg+Pythia 8 sample with the matrix-element correction turned off. This uncertainty is typically a few percent, increasing to 5%\u201310% at large ptt\u0304T and |ptt\u0304out|, and small \u2206\u03c6tt\u0304. To assess the uncertainty associated with the choice of parton-shower and hadronization model, a comparison is made between the unfolded and generator-level distributions of simulated events created with the Powheg+Herwig 7 generator but using the nominal corrections and migration matrices. The resulting systematic uncertainties, taken as the symmetrized difference, are found to be less than 5%.\nThe uncertainty related to the modelling of initial- and final-state radiation is determined by using tt\u0304 MC samples with modified ISR/FSR settings [124]. Four different upward/downward variations of MC simulation parameters are performed to assess the ISR uncertainty; these have a significant effect on initial-state radiation, while the effect on final-state radiation is small. The upward (downward) variations are defined by scaling of each of \u00b5r and \u00b5f by a factor of 0.5 (2), the setting of hdamp to 3mtop (1.5mtop), and the variation of the A14 tuned set of parameters encoded by the Var3cUp (Var3cDown) parameter [68, 124]. The effects caused by independent variations of individual parameters are summed in quadrature to define the ISR uncertainty. For FSR, variations are defined by scaling \u00b5r and \u00b5f for FSR only. The FSR-up variation uses a scale factor of 0.5 while the FSR-down variation uses a factor of 2. This uncertainty is found to be approximately 5% or lower depending on the observable considered.\nThe uncertainty arising from PDFs is assessed using the Powheg+Pythia 8 tt\u0304 sample. The sample is reweighted to the nominal PDF4LHC15 PDF set and the uncertainty in the unfolded distributions arising from the uncertainties in that PDF set is determined using the Hessian approach with 30 eigenvectors [89]. This uncertainty is found to be approximately 1%.\nThe effect of varying the top-quark mass by \u00b11 GeV had a negligible effect on the unfolded results.\nThe uncertainty in the combined Run 2 integrated luminosity is 1.7% [125], obtained using the LUCID-2 detector [126] for the primary luminosity measurements. This uncertainty affects the rate of backgrounds estimated using MC calculations. It also affects the overall normalization as seen in eq. (7.1), but has negligible effect on the normalized differential cross-section measurements. The uncertainty arising from the size of the nominal MC sample is approximately 1%."

            "text": "The nominal Powheg+Pythia 8 particle-level and parton-level cross-sections for topquark pair production in their corresponding fiducial phase-space regions are 20% larger than the observed values as shown in figure 9 and figure 21, respectively. The significance of this difference is \u223c1.1 standard deviations when taking into account both the uncertainties of the measurements and the corresponding uncertainties in the Powheg+Pythia 8 predictions. At both the particle level and parton level, there is better agreement with the Powheg+Herwig 7.1.3 calculations and the predictions of Powheg+Pythia 8 with increased initial- and final-state radiation, where the differences correspond to \u223c0.5 standard deviations. Agreement with the nominal Powheg+Pythia 8 calculation improves after reweighting those to the NNLO calculation. At parton level, even better agreement with the NNLO Matrix calculation is observed for various definitions of the renormalization and factorization scales, as well as for different PDF sets. This is consistent with previous measurements that have observed that the top-quark pT spectra are softer than in various NLO+PS predictions at high top-quark pT [8\u201311, 13\u201315]. The particle-level and parton-level fiducial phase-space differential cross-sections are compared with several SM predictions. In this comparison, there are no uncertainties associated with the predictions. The information provided by the shapes of the differential cross-section measurements is compared with the calculations using the \u03c72 test described in section 8.2, which takes into account the correlations between the measured quantities while the uncertainty in the prediction is not included. The largest correlations at the detector level arise from sources of uncertainty that affect all bins equally. The most sensitive comparison uses the normalized differential cross-sections because many of the common detector-level uncertainties largely cancel out. The \u03c72 values and associated p-values are shown in table 4 and table 5 for the normalized particle-level and parton-level fiducial phase-space differential cross-sections, respectively. The multidimensional distributions are labeled such that the innermost observable is listed as the last one. No comparison with the fixed-order NNLO calculation is shown because numerical instabilities were observed in certain phase-space regions (e.g. around ptt\u0304T \u223c 0). In the case of the normalized particle-level fiducial phase-space differential crosssections, good agreement is generally observed. The one-dimensional distributions that are sensitive to extra radiation (i.e. the pT of the tt\u0304 system, ptt\u0304T, the out-of-plane momentum,\n\u2223\u2223\u2223ptt\u0304out\u2223\u2223\u2223, and the absolute value of the azimuthal separation of the top-quark jets,\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2206\u03c6tt\u0304\u2223\u2223\u2223) yield p-values below 1% for all MC predictions except for the nominal prediction of Powheg+Pythia 8 and those including more initial- and final-state radiation. These distributions indicate a deficit of radiation in the MC predictions, i.e. ptt\u0304T (figure 12(a)) and ptt\u0304out (figure 12(c)) are softer, while\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2206\u03c6tt\u0304\u2223\u2223\u2223 (figure 12(b)) is closer to \u03c0 for the predictions. Moreover, the aMC@NLO+Pythia 8 calculations for these observables differ significantly from the predictions of the other MC generators. It is notable that these discrepancies are not evident in the parton-level comparisons.

            "text": "The SMEFT [52] provides a theoretically elegant way to encode the modifications of the top-quark properties induced by a wide class of BSM theories that reduce to the SM at low energies. Within the mathematical language of the SMEFT relevant to top-quark physics, the effects of BSM dynamics are characterized by an energy scale \u039b at which BSM effects become apparent and which is well above the typical scale for top-quark processes given by mtop. These BSM effects can be parameterized at low energies, E \u039b, in terms of higher-dimensional operators built from the SM fields while respecting symmetries of the SM such as gauge invariance using the Lagrangian\nLSMEFT = LSM + \u2211\ni\nCi \u039b2O (6) i + \u2211 j Bj \u039b4O (8) j + ..., (11.1)\n\u2013 57 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\nwhere LSM is the SM Lagrangian, O(6)i and O (8) j represent a complete set of operators of mass-dimensions d = 6 and d = 8, and Ci and Bj are the corresponding complex-valued Wilson coefficients that determine the strength of the operators. Operators with d = 5 and d = 7 violate lepton and/or baryon number conservation and are not relevant for topquark physics. The effective-theory expansion in eq. (11.1) is robust, fully general, and can be systematically matched to explicit ultraviolet-complete BSM scenarios. Contributions from operators of mass-dimension d = 8 or higher are not considered in this analysis.\nMeasurements of top-quark differential cross-sections can place constraints on SMEFT Wilson coefficients. For any cross-section \u03c3(Ci), the corresponding expression including SM and SMEFT operators up to dimension-6 becomes\n\u03c3(Ci) = \u03c3SM + \u03c3SM\u2013EFT + \u03c3EFT\u2013EFT\n= \u03c3SM + 1 \u039b2 \u2211\ni\n\u03b1iCi + 1 \u039b4 \u2211\ni\n\u03b2iC 2 i + 1 \u039b4 \u2211 i,j,i<j \u03b2\u0303ijCiCj , (11.2)\nwhere \u03c3SM is the SM cross-section for the given process and \u03c3SM\u2013EFT is an interference term between SM and BSM operators, which depends linearly on the Wilson coefficients Ci. The last term, \u03c3EFT\u2013EFT, includes products of BSM operators, including possible interference between SMEFT operators, and depends quadratically on the Wilson coefficients Ci. The constants \u03b1i, \u03b2i, and \u03b2\u0303ij are used to parameterize the dependence of the cross-section on each Wilson coefficient. Their determination is described below.\nFor the presented results, the \u2018dim6top\u2019 model [53, 127] is used to implement SMEFT at leading order, using the Warsaw basis for the operators [128]. Signal events for this study were generated with the aMC@NLO MC generator and include contributions from the SM term, SM\u2013EFT interference, and the EFT\u2013EFT interference term. Within the dim6top model, there are numerous Wilson coefficients describing non-SM top-quark interactions. A total of 43 coefficients are systematically explored to identify those that could be constrained by the differential cross-section measurements.\nThree different sets of operators are identified among these coefficients: 2-liqht-quark and 2-heavy-quark (2LQ2HQ) operators, 4-heavy-quark (4HQ) operators, and 2-heavyquark plus boson (2HQV) operators. Measurements are made for a subset of coefficients, chosen with regard to sensitivity, stability of results for linear and linear+quadratic terms, and competitiveness with the results reported in global EFT fits [129, 130].\nThese sensitivity considerations lead to individual measurements of seven Wilson coefficients, all corresponding to 2LQ2HQ operators: C3,8Qq , C 1,8 Qq , C8Qu, C8Qd, C8tq, C8tu, and C8td. The operators feature different chiral and colour structures indicated by lower and upper indexes [53]. All these coefficients are purely real with no imaginary part. No individual limits are placed on 2HQV operators since the only sensitive coefficient, CtG, does not provide limits competitive with the best one-dimensional limits available. However, the real part of CtG is measured in combination with C3,8Qq while no limit is placed on the imaginary part of CtG. No limits on 4HQ operators are presented since their sensitivity largely originates from terms in \u03c3EFT\u2013EFT suppressed by \u039b\u22124. As interference effects from dimension-8 operators with SM operators, for which no calculations are available, contribute to the\n\u2013 58 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\ncross-section at the same power of \u039b, the interpretation of such limits is difficult. Simultaneous measurements of pairs of Wilson coefficients are made for three combinations that serve as an example for other combinations from the same set of operators. In particular, the measurement of CtG vs C3,8Qq is an example of the 2HQV vs 2LQ2HQ combinations and C3,8Qq vs C 1,8 Qq and C 1,8 Qq vs C8tq are examples of 2LQ2HQ vs 2LQ2HQ combinations. The absolute differential cross-section at parton level as a function of p t,1T is found to be more sensitive to EFT effects than the differential cross-sections for other observables (|y t,1|, Htt\u0304T , mtt\u0304,\n\u2223\u2223\u2223ytt\u0304\u2223\u2223\u2223) for which it is possible to make NNLO calculations using the Matrix program. EFT constraints are therefore set using the absolute differential cross-section as a function of p t,1T . The unfolding procedure recovers within 1% the generator-level distribution for an input p t,1T distribution that includes the EFT contributions for both tt\u0304 signal and tt\u0304 non-all-hadronic background where the Wilson coefficients values are set to the expected upper limits of this measurement. For each bin of the pt,1T distribution, a parameterization using the quadratic dependence of the differential cross-section as a function of a given Wilson coefficient is developed according to eq. (11.2), i.e. the \u03b1i, \u03b2i constants for each Wilson coefficient and for each bin of the distribution are determined. The \u03b2\u0303ij constants are then estimated by fitting the above formula to samples having two Ci non-zero and using the previously determined values of \u03b1i and \u03b2i. The \u03c3SM parameter determined in the above parameterization gives the LO SM tt\u0304 calculation and is not used.\nThe nominal Matrix NNLO calculation with the symmetrized scale uncertainty is employed as the SM prediction for the full model used to interpret the differential crosssection. The parameterization of LO EFT effects obtained above includes linear, quadratic, and cross-terms and is also used in the fit. The model includes all systematic and statistical uncertainties of the measurement, as well as their correlations as described by the covariance matrix of the differential measurement. In the model, the NNLO QCD scale uncertainty is used as a theoretical uncertainty and it is taken as fully correlated between the measurements. It was verified that a given scale variation always provides the maximum (or minimum) value for all the predictions. It was also verified that changing the correlation from 100% to 50% has little impact on the limits. The full fit is implemented in the Bayesian inference tool EFTfitter [131]. To make the dependence of the Wilson coefficients on the energy scale of the new physics explicit, the results are presented as the product Ci(TeV/\u039b)2. This also facilitates comparisons with other results where \u039b = 1 TeV. Fits of seven individual Wilson coefficients are performed with all other coefficients set to zero. A summary of the 95% confidence level (CL) and 68% CL limits is shown in figure 34. The limits are provided for cases where both linear and quadratic terms are included and for cases where only linear terms are included. The 95% CL limits on Ci(TeV/\u039b)2 are within the range of (\u22120.9,+0.5) for cases where both linear and quadratic terms are included. The inclusion of the quadratic terms leads to tighter bounds by 30%\u2013 60% for all Wilson coefficients. The ratios of various SMEFT predictions that include non-zero Wilson coefficients to the data for the leading top-quark p t,1T distribution are shown in figure 35. The effect of EFT contributions is seen mainly in the highest p t,1T bin.

The fiducial phase-space cross-sections and differential cross-sections are compared with several NLO calculations with and without parton showering and hadronization, and with a parton-level NNLO calculation. The tt\u0304 events were produced in 13 TeV pp collisions and recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\u22121.\nThe observed particle-level fiducial phase-space and parton-level fiducial phase-space cross-sections are\n\u03c3tt\u0304,fidparticle \u00d7B(tt\u0304\u2192 hadrons) = 331\u00b1 3(stat.)\u00b1 39(syst.) fb, and\n\u03c3tt\u0304,fidparton = 1.94\u00b1 0.02(stat.)\u00b1 0.25(syst.) pb.\nBoth are approximately 20% lower than the Powheg+Pythia 8 NLO+PS predictions scaled to the NNLO total cross-section of 398+48\u221249 fb and 2.34 \u00b1 0.28 pb for particle and parton level, respectively, but still compatible within the uncertainties. The result at parton level is in excellent agreement with the NNLO prediction 1.96+0.02\u22120.17 pb. Normalized particle-level fiducial phase-space differential cross-sections are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the leading and second-leading top-quark jets, and a top-quark jet chosen at random from each event. Also, normalized differential cross-sections are measured as a function of the mass, pT, and rapidity of the tt\u0304 system. In addition, a set of observables describing the hard-scattering interaction (cos \u03b8?, \u03c7tt\u0304, and ytt\u0304B) and sensitive to the emission of radiation along with the tt\u0304 final state (\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2206\u03c6tt\u0304\u2223\u2223\u2223, \u2223\u2223\u2223ptt\u0304out\u2223\u2223\u2223, and Htt\u0304T ) are presented. Normalized parton-level fiducial phase-space differential cross-sections are also shown for the same set of observables. Furthermore, several normalized double- and triple-differential distributions as a function of a subset of the observables described above are presented.\nThe normalized differential cross-sections exhibit a precision of 10%\u201320% and are in agreement with several NLO+PS predictions for most of the observables measured. These result in the most precise differential cross-sections measured in the boosted tt\u0304 all-hadronic final state, with uncertainties being a factor of two smaller than in previous ATLAS measurements overall, and up to a factor of four smaller in the region with top-quark pT > 1 TeV. A notable disagreement between the measurement and the NLO+PS prediction is observed in the second-leading top-quark pT distribution, where the data are softer than predicted, as seen in several previous ATLAS studies. Also, observables sensitive to gluon radiation are not well described by most NLO+PS MC calculations. Agreement with the NNLO predictions at the parton level is in general better than with the NLO+PS calculations. These observations point to the need for NNLO+PS MC calculations, as well as a better understanding of initial- and final-state radiation.\nAn interpretation of the measurements of these boosted tt\u0304 events within the SMEFT framework is performed for the first time. Using the measurement of the parton-level\n\u2013 62 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 0\nleading top-quark pT differential cross-section, limits are set on individual coefficients of several four-fermion operators. These are competitive with, and typically more stringent than, existing limits from global EFT fits. Moreover, two-dimensional limits are also set on several pairs of coefficients. This SMEFT interpretation shows that boosted tt\u0304 crosssection measurements are well-suited to constraining several four-fermion operators and will be useful in future global EFT analyses."
