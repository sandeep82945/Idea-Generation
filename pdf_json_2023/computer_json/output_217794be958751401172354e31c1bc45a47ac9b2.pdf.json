    "abstractText": "5G new radio (NR) technology is introduced to satisfy more demanding services. Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) requires very low delay compared with the previous techniques. This is hard to achieve when hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is applied and especially when the feedback channel is erroneous. In this work, we consider various delay components in incremental redundancy (IR) HARQ systems and minimize the average delay by applying asymmetric feedback detection (AFD) and find the optimal transmission length for each transmission attempt. A M/G/1 queuing model is used in this work to analyze the queuing delay in 5G NR when there are multiple uses in the system. Numerical results show that significant performance gains and lower outage probability can be achieved by applying AFD.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe fifth generation (5G) wireless mobile networks are developed to achieve substantial performance improvements [1]. Low latency and high reliability are key requirements in most scenarios, particularly in Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC). Ideally, 1ms end-to-end latency and 99.999% reliability are expected, but there are still some hurdles to work out. For example, hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) acts as a bottleneck to the optimization of user-plane latency.\nCombining Forward error correction (FEC) and automatic repeat request (ARQ), HARQ is a high-efficiency technique for data transmission, which performs much better than ordinary ARQ in poor channel conditions. Based on the softcombining method at the receiver, HARQ can be divided into chase-combining HARQ (CC-HARQ) and incremental redundancy HARQ (IR-HARQ). In CC-HARQ, the same codeword is transmitted in different transmissions, while in IRHARQ, retransmissions include additional parity-check bits. We only consider IR-HARQ in this work as coding gain is more significant in general wireless communication systems. In the conventional IR-HARQ protocols, the decoding state is released by the receiver using feedback. If the feedback is binary, the transmitter is only able to know whether the decoding was successful, hence the length and power of each transmission attempt is fixed [2], [3]. With longer feedback, the transmitter can acquire more information about the decoding states, and based on which, the transmitter might be able to adaptively select some of the parameters of the subsequent transmission. Adaptive system is a promising technique to enhance the performance of various systems by adjusting the system configuration based on the system parameters [4]\u2013\n[9]. Adaptive ARQ in cognative radio networks can increase the utilization of the resources, and somehow reduce overall delay [9]\u2013[12]. Similarly, adaptive HARQ is widely studied based on different transmission parameters, including rate adaptation [13], [14], power adaptation [15], [16], and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) schemes [17].\nThe feedback has to be prolonged to convey the full decoding state. In [2], the relationship between feedback resolution and the overall throughput is studied. The results show that if the feedback includes more than 8 bits, the performance is very close to an ideal feedback HARQ system. However, transmitting 8-bit feedback is still unrealistic in reality due to the high cost of the feedback channel. When the quality of the feedback channel is low, applying extra feedback bits will increase the feedback error rate and make the error harder to analyse.\nIn most of the previous works, the feedback channel is assumed to be deterministic whereas the error probability of the HARQ feedback can not be made arbitrarily low in reality. A feedback error rate of 1% is reasonable in LTE [18] and 0.1%- 1% in 5G NR [19]. With limited resource [20], [21], unreliable feedback will impair the performance of the HARQ system. There are only a few contributions on HARQ with unreliable feedback. In [22], [23], the feedback channel is modeled as a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). In [24], a notion of guaranteeable delay is introduced while the feedback channel is an erasure channel. Different from conventional symmetric feedback detection, asymmetric feedback detection (AFD) is introduced in [25] to provide a better protection to negative acknowledgement (NACK) without assigning extra resources. In our previous work [26], we apply AFD to rate-adaptive HARQ and find the optimal thresholds and transmission rates to maximize throughput.\nIn this work, we study the long-term average delay of a HARQ process with imperfect feedback. We consider multiple delay components including queuing delay, transmission delay, and processing delay. We apply both AFD and rate-adaptive HARQ in this work to minimize the long-term average delay of the system. Another advantage of AFD is that it reduces the outage probability, so we also study the performance of the systems with outage probability constraints. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly reduce the long-term average delay compared with traditional methods."

            "text": "If the feedback channel is perfect, an outage occurs only when the receiver is still unable to recover the message after M transmission attempts. If an outage occurs, this transmission will be handed over to the higher layer protocols and a new HARQ round will be initialized. Outages can cause significant system performance degradation. For normal HARQ processes, an outage probability of 0.1%-1% is tolerable [19]. If the feedback channel is imperfect, NACK errors will cause outages, and ACK errors will only lead to unnecessary retransmissions.\nThe feedback is binary quantized based on a feedback detection threshold. In symmetric feedback detection (SFD), the feedback detection threshold is set as Fig. 1a so that the areas of ACK and NACK on the constellation are equal. However, in the case of AFD, the area of NACK on the constellation should be larger than it of ACK to reduce NACK error rate, which is illustrated in Fig. 1b. \u03b1 \u2208 R is an index defined by the ratio of the minimum Euclidean distance from the asymmetric decoding threshold to the origin on the constellation diagram over the amplitude. The amplitude of the signal is normalized in Fig. 1. This AFD scheme is distance-based. Other schemes based on other parameters (such as phase shift) are also studied, but they result in poorer\none binary symbol through an additive Gaussian noise channel (AWGN). For the i-th transmission, the ACK error rate PA,i and the NACK error rate PN,i can be computed by:\nPN,i = 1\n2 erfc\n(\n(1 + \u03b1i) \u221a SNRf\n)\n, (3)\nPA,i = 1\n2 erfc\n(\n(1\u2212 \u03b1i) \u221a SNRf\n)\n, (4)\nwhere SNRf is the signal-to-noise ratio of the feedback channel and \u03b1i is the asymmetric detection index of the ith feedback."

The probability that the decoding fails after the i-th transmission attempt Pi,f can be written as:\nPi,f = P\n{\ni \u2211\nm=1\nIm < Nb\n}\n, (5)\nwhere Im is the normalized MI in the m-th transmission defined as:\nIm = nmTslotW log(1 + |hm| 2SNRd), (6)\nwhere W is the available bandwidth. To calculate Pi,f , we need to find the probability density function (pdf) of the accumulated MI. Let Zi = \u2211i\nm=1 Il denote the summation of MI in the first i transmissions.

If we consider the propagation time to be negligible, the total RTT for each transmission is upper bounded by:\nTtot \u2264 Tqueue + Ttran + kTslot.

(17)\nIn our previous work [26], we have shown that the optimal performance of the HARQ process is achieved when the outage probability is considerably higher than expected. Therefore, the minimum delay with tight outage probability limits \u01eb must be achieved when the actual outage probability Pout = \u01eb.

Some of the simulation parameters are listed in Table II.\nFirst, we assume that there is no outage probability limits. We compare our proposed AFD scheme with conventional SFD scheme in terms of long-term average delay. Both schemes apply rate adaptation, and even then we can see that our AFD scheme significantly outperforms SFD, especially when the quality of the feedback channel is low. When the downlink channel is of low quality, the average delay of SFD scheme increases sharply, while the impact of low-quality downlink channel on AFD is not significant compared to the system with perfect feedback channel. Compared with a system with perfect HARQ feedback, by applying AFD, we can achieve almost the same performance at SNRf = 0dB, and only slightly higher delay at SNRf = \u22125dB.\nWe also find the minimum achievable long-term average delay under strict outage probability limits when SNRf = 0dB (see Fig. 4). When 5% outage probability is required, the performance suffers slightly, but still better than the SFD scheme even without the limits. However, when the outage\nprobability is required to be under 1%, despite it is still achievable with our AFD scheme, the delay is much higher than expected."
