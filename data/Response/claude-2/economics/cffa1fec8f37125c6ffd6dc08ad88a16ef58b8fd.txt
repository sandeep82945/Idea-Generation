 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of different organic food categories (fruits/vegetables, dairy, meat, etc.) on consumer attitudes and willingness to pay a premium. The current study looked at organic food broadly, but attitudes may differ depending on food type.

2. Investigate the role of organic food knowledge and experience on attitudes and willingness to pay. More knowledgeable and experienced consumers may have different reactions to organic credence attributes.

3. Conduct cross-cultural comparisons of how credence attributes influence willingness to pay a premium for organic food. Compare results from China to other countries to see if relationships differ. 

4. Evaluate the impact of different communication strategies (e.g. sustainability messaging, health claims, etc.) on consumer attitudes and willingness to pay. This could provide insight into optimal messaging approaches.

5. Incorporate additional moderating variables such as food neophobia, environmental concern, or price sensitivity to further understand boundary conditions of the conceptual model.
