Development of Adaptive Liquid Jet Technologies for Ultrafast Phenomena Studies: Innovate further on liquid jet technology to create adaptive, responsive jet systems capable of dynamically adjusting their parameters (e.g., jet velocity, diameter, and shape) in real-time based on the experiment's needs. This could enhance the study of ultrafast chemical reactions and phase transitions in liquids by providing optimal conditions for each experiment's unique requirements.

Exploitation of Multi-Color XES for Complex Systems Analysis: Utilize the multi-color X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) capabilities for comprehensive studies of multi-metallic or heterogenous catalytic systems in liquid phases. By simultaneously collecting XES signals of different elements, researchers can dissect the roles and dynamics of various components in complex catalytic processes or energy transfer mechanisms in photovoltaic materials.

Advanced Nozzle Designs for Minimal Sample Consumption in Serial Crystallography: With the capabilities for droplet-on-demand (DoD) and gas dynamic virtual nozzles (GDVN) highlighted, a direction for research could focus on refining these technologies to further minimize sample consumption. This would be particularly impactful for serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) of rare or difficult-to-synthesize compounds, including biological macromolecules and organometallic complexes.

Integrated Studies of Photoinduced Dynamics Using Combined XES and WAXS: Leverage the capability to perform simultaneous X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) without experimental setup reconfiguration. This integrated approach can provide unprecedented insights into photoinduced electronic changes and structural dynamics within the same experiment, paving the way for a deeper understanding of processes such as photophysics in organic photovoltaics or light-induced structural changes in biomolecules.

High-Throughput Screening of Material Responses to Ultrafast Stimuli: Utilizing the high photon flux and fast repetition rates of the European XFEL, develop high-throughput screening methods for materials (e.g., catalysts, semiconductor materials, or metal-organic frameworks) under ultrafast optical or X-ray stimuli. This could accelerate the discovery of materials with exceptional responses to light, such as ultrafast switches, or materials with unique phase transitions, contributing to advancements in electronics, photonics, and energy storage.
