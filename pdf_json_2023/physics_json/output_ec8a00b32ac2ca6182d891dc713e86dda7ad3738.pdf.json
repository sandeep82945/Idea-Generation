    "abstractText": "With the continuous growth of industrialization, the presence of heavy metals (HMs) in the environment has become a critical issue, necessitating cost-effective and efficient techniques for their removal. The present study aimed to determine the optimal preparation conditions for synthesizing pectin (PC) as a polymer sorbent, combined with Magnesium (Mg) Aluminum (Al) layered double oxides (LDOs), using a fast and facile co-precipitation method. Both the response surface method (RSM) and the Taguchi method were employed to optimize the influence of key independent variables, including the molar ratio of cations Mg:Al, the ratio of pectin to LDO, and the temperature for removing multiple elements from wastewater. The results indicated that RSM is more accurate and examines more interactions, while Taguchi reduces the number of tests and is more economical than RSM. However, both statistical methods showed good potential for predicting the adsorption capacity (Qe) of HMs. The optimal preparation conditions were identified as a molar ratio of 3:1, a ratio of pectin to LDO of 7% w/w, and a temperature of approximately 600 \u25e6C. In conclusion, the application of RSM and Taguchi approaches was found to be feasible and effective in optimizing the preparation conditions of modified LDO, which can be utilized as a potential adsorbent for removing multiple elements from wastewater.",

            "text": "Industrial wastewater containing toxic heavy metals (HMs) has led to severe environmental issues in recent years due to rapid industrialization [1]. HMs contaminate water, infiltrating the food chain and posing risks to organisms. Consequently, it is imperative to develop an effective and straightforward method for eliminating HMs from aqueous solutions [2]. Various techniques like biodegradation [3], photo-degradation [4], and chemical oxidation [5] have been employed for HMs removal from wastewater. However, these methods come with limitations, such as high energy consumption [6]. An expeditious, cost-effective, and efficient approach for HM removal is through adsorption. Utilizing adsorbents that are both economical and environmentally friendly can significantly enhance the efficiency of the adsorption process [7]. Layered double hydroxides (LDH), anionic clay adsorbents with layered structures, represent an excellent choice for eliminating pollutants from aqueous solutions due to their favorable interlayer anion exchangeability, non-toxic properties, exceptional surface area, and ease of preparation [8,9]. Some researchers propose that layered double oxide (LDO), the calcined byproduct of LDH, possesses a larger surface area and greater adsorption capacity compared to LDH [1]. The adsorption capacity (Qe) values for Magnesium (Mg) Manganese (Mn)-LDH and MgMn-LDO are 5.635 and 8.234 (mmol g\u22121), respectively, suggesting that the active sites on MgMn-LDO are more abundant than those on MgMn-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3778. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15183778 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3778 2 of 25\nLDH [10]. As a result, LDO could serve as a valuable sorbent for remediating both organic and inorganic pollutants. The limitation of relying solely on LDHs is their lack of stability over extended periods, rendering them non-regenerable. To enhance stability, larger recalcitrant material particles can support LDH, including materials derived from agricultural waste like biochar and activated carbon [9]. Encouraging results have been demonstrated by LDH-biochar composites in HM removal [11]. The utilization of zinc (Zn) and Aluminum (Al)-LDH/biochar led to a 44% increase in pollutant removal compared to the use of ZnAl-LDH alone [12,13], successfully introducing an innovative adsorbent, LDH-biochar, to bolster the adsorption capacity and prevent LDH disintegration. Green adsorbents derived from agricultural waste find application as economical and eco-friendly sorbents for removing HMs from aqueous solutions [14]. Pectin (PC), a polymer obtainable from most plants, is a green adsorbent utilized for wastewater cleanup. Its composite with other adsorbents, such as chitosan, holds significant potential to enhance adsorption capacity and stability [15]. The licorice plant (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.), a perennial herb with valuable components, has garnered attention in the food and pharmaceutical industries in Iran and other nations [16]. Due to its medicinal and commercial value, illicit cultivation of this plant is rising, leading to the generation of waste materials. However, no study has explored the utilization of licorice waste as a foundational material for adsorbents. Thus, biomass wastes like licorice pomace present a viable option for synthesizing PC to address cost and environmental concerns. The capacity of commonly used LDO and modified LDO in adsorption methods are influenced by various factors, including calcination temperature, molar ratio (M+2/M+3), weight, and the source of the bioabsorbent [17]. Comparing the effects of these factors necessitates a broad range of experiments, which can be time-consuming, expensive, and challenging. Taguchi and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) are potent statisticalmathematical techniques for modeling, optimizing, designing experiments, and analyzing the impact of independent operational factors and their interactions. These approaches can help reduce the number of experiment runs and associated costs [18,19]. However, as far as the authors are aware, there is limited research comparing these two statistical methods for optimizing LDO-pectin synthesis conditions in metal removal from wastewater. Achieving the highest removal efficiency for each HM demands specific LDO with welldefined preparation conditions. Yet, no study has focused on determining the optimal and economic conditions for LDO synthesis and the interaction effects of the three most crucial factors on its sorption capacity. This study encompassed the characterization of modified adsorbents, assessment of the removal efficiency of HMs from aqueous solutions, determination of adsorption capacity, and exploration of adsorption mechanisms. The results of this study hold potential for the development of efficient and environmentally friendly adsorption materials designed to eliminate HMs from aqueous solutions. The aim of this study is to achieve the optimal conditions for synthesizing modified LDO (LDO-pectin/LDO-PC) adsorbents using RSM and Taguchi optimization methods. Initially, the experiment was conducted following the arrangement suggested by RSM, and subsequently, the same arrangement was used to design the Taguchi test. Initially, the removal efficiency (RE) (%) of nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) by all prepared sorbents was determined. Then, the optimal and less effective adsorbents (undesirable) were selected, and their characteristics were measured. Finally, kinetic and isotherm tests were conducted using the optimal sorbent. This study also represents the first investigation into modified LDO (LDO-PC) synthesis and its optimal conditions."

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\nBased on Tables S1 and S2, the variances in the experimental results were analyzed using a quadratic regression model derived from the experiment\u2019s data. ANOVA is employed in both the RSM and Taguchi models to evaluate the significance of differences between factors and the appropriateness of the model predictions compared to the experimental outcomes. The model is deemed suitable and valuable when its p-value is less than 0.05 (indicating significance) and its lack of fit is greater than 0.05 (indicating insignificance) [28]. With smaller p-values and higher F-values, all models demonstrated a favorable potential for predicting the Qe of HMs. The R2 values for the QeZn model based on RSM and Taguchi were 0.99 and 0.77, respectively. These results indicate that RSM exhibits superior predictive power and accuracy compared to the Taguchi method. For instance, in the case of Zn, based on the p-values in Table S1, factors A, B, C, AB, and AC are significant (p < 0.05), while factor BC is non-significant (p > 0.05). The influence of the three factors on the Qe of LDO for the studied HMs (excluding Zn) was as follows: ratio of pectin to LDO > temperature > molar ratio.

For all factors, the top-ranking parameter was consistent between both methods, while the second and third rankings differed (refer to Table 6).\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3778 11 of 25\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 25 Table 6.

Response Surface Optimization To attain the highest Qe (mg g\u22121) using the RSM method, the optimal conditions for the molar ratio of cation, the ratio of pectin to LDO, and the temperature were determined as 3.012, 577 RT, and 6.98 (w/w%), respectively. Remarkably, these results closely mirror the optimal levels suggested by the Taguchi method. These optimal synthesis conditions for the sorbent differ from the preparation conditions used in prior research for other adsorbents. This finding underscores the necessity of distinct synthesis conditions for sorbents when addressing the remediation of various types of HMs. Verification tests were conducted under optimal conditions to validate the accuracy of the predicted values (see Table 7). According to the data in Table 6, the actual Qe values for Zn, Cd, Pb, and Ni were 99.43, 99.98, 99.42, and 99.40 mg g\u22121, respectively. In comparison, the predicted Qe values for Zn, Cd, Pb, and Ni were 101.51, 100.86, 101.96, and 99.91 mg g\u22121, resulting in percentage errors of 2.41%, 1.30%, 2.73%, and 1.4%, respectively. However, using the Taguchi method, the percentage error exceeded 6%; this demonstrates that the RSM model accurately predicts the Qe values for the four studied HMs using the modified LDO adsorbent."

The influence of the solution\u2019s initial pH on the RE% of Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni was evaluated at various ranges of pH values ~(4.0 to 9.0) onto the modified LDO and LDH sorbents, as shown in Figure 6. In modified LDO, the maximum RE % of Zn and Pb was obtained at pH 8, while Cd and Ni exhibited the maximum RE% at pH 7. However, the highest value of RE% for four studied HMs by LDH adsorbent was about 7. The RE% of HM by modified LDO adsorbent increased with increasing pH from 4 to 7 and, after that, did not change and reach equilibrium. Also, the value of RE% by LDH adsorbent after pH 7 decreased with increased pH. At pH 4.0 to 7.0, weak sorption of HMs ions related to competition with H+ ions for active sites of the modified LDO and LDH sorbents [26]. At a range of 7 to 8, the electrostatic repulsions between the surface of modified LDO and the positively charged Zn, Pb, Cd, and Pb are depressed, which increases the RE% of HMs. The decrease in RE (%) of HMs at pH values (7.0\u20139.0) could be related to the repulsion between the negative charge of the anionic species in solution and the negative surface charge of the undesired sorbent [29]. It is easy to understand that the neutralization condition is favorable for HMs sorption. Meanwhile, this result indicates that modified LDO adsorbent maintains a stable adsorption performance under neutralization and basic environment. As a result, the subsequent experiments were carried out at about 7. Based on Figure 7, the measured value pHPZC for the modified LDO and LDH sorbents was ~7 and 5. This result indicated that at pH below pHpzc, modified LDO becomes positively charged, and at pH bigger than pHpzc, it becomes negatively charged. Some researchers have reported that at pH values below pHpzc, the removal efficiency of HMs increases slightly. This phenomenon is related to the saturation of the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3778 15 of 25\nsorbent surface by H+ ions or the presence of electrostatic repulsion between positively charged HMs. If the pH value is greater than pHpzc, the surface of the sorbent might become negatively charged, leading to a higher force of attraction for cationic species and resulting in increased sorption [30]. It follows that it can be justified that this parameter is one of the most crucial in improving the RE value of HMs.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x. https://doi.org/10.3390/xxxxx www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\ni r .

According to the results, the modified LDO adsorbent exhibited a greater number of functional groups compared to the LDH sorbent. Despite some similarities between the two adsorbents, their distinctions were linked to the presence of pectin and their calcination temperatures. The peaks at 3500, 3000, 1600, and 1350 cm\u22121 were indicative of \u2013OH, C-H, C=C, and C-O-C functionalities, respectively [22,27]. The band between 400 to 800 cm\u22121 was appeared in the modified LDO and LDH sorbents was attributed to the lattice vibrations for Mg-O and Al-O [31]. The range of 3500\u20133700 cm\u22121 was associated with residual water molecules and hydroxyl groups. In the modified LDO, two peaks were observed within this range, while only one peak existed in the LDH adsorbent. A reduction in the intensity of the absorption peak at 1358 cm\u22121 (specific O-C-O\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3778 16 of 25\nstretching vibration) was observed in the modified LDO adsorbent compared to the LDH sorbent.

Reusability of the Modified LDO and LDH Sorbents for HMs Adsorption\nA crucial aspect of any sorbent is its reusability, which contributes to the economic viability of the sorption process [32]. In this study, the reusability of the modified LDO and LDH sorbents was investigated across five consecutive cycles (Figure 9). The removal efficiency (RE) (%) of HMs using both the modified LDO and LDH sorbents was evaluated at initial Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni concentrations of 100 mg L\u22121, an adsorbent concentration of 1.0 g L\u22121, and a reaction time of 180 min. For instance, the results demonstrated that the RE (%) of Cd using the modified LDO adsorbent decreased from 97% to 91%, while for the LDH adsorbent, it decreased from 92% to 79%; this highlights the successful and sustained sportive application of the modified LDO sorbent over five consecutive cycles, underscoring that modified LDO (with a molar ratio of 3:1, 600 \u25e6C, and 7% pectin) possesses high durability and robust mechanical strength. Conversely, the LDH adsorbent (with a molar ratio 2:1) exhibited instability and reduced efficiency during testing. Therefore, while the LDH adsorbent (simple LDH) is not a suitable candidate for purifying aqueous solutions, the modified LDO adsorbent proves to be an excellent choice for removing HMs.\n3.2.4. Morphology\nThe surface morphology of both the modified LDO and LDH sorbents was examined through SEM\u2013EDX analysis (Figure 10, Table 8). Figure 10 showed that the modified LDO adsorbent displayed more porous structures and an irregular, rough shape, whereas the LDH adsorbent exhibited a smooth surface. The modified LDO sorbent featured rough surfaces, a porous structure, and an irregular shape, which facilitated the creation of active sites for the sorption of HMs onto the adsorbent [33,34]. Following the adsorption experiment, both adsorbents underwent deformation, manifesting as the formation of a\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3778 17 of 25\nwhite layer, a reduction in cavities, and the appearance of cracks, indicative of the successful sorption of HMs onto the sorbent [35]. The EDX analysis outcomes for the modified LDO and LDH sorbents revealed the presence of fundamental elements such as C, O, Al, and Mg. The modified LDO adsorbent contained higher levels of C, Al, and Mg, attributed to the elevated cation ratio (Mg:Al 3:1) and the ratio of pectin to LDO when compared to the LDH adsorbent (Mg:Al 2:1). Post adsorption experiment, the quantities of Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni increased in both the modified LDO and LDH sorbents adsorbents, although the increase was more pronounced in the modified LDO adsorbent. The sequence of HMs amounts in the modified LDO adsorbent was Zn > Pb > Ni > Cd (refer to Table 5). Consequently, based on the SEM\u2013EDX findings, it is likely that the modified LDO sorbent possessed a higher Qe than the LDH sorbent. The results of BET analysis showed that LDH sorbent had a low surface area (7.06 m2 g\u22121) and a small pore size (5.22 nm).

            "text": "To evaluate the rate-controlling step of HMs by the sorbent, adsorption kinetics serves as a valuable tool [36,37]. In order to determine the kinetic mechanism of Zn, Cd, Pb, and Ni adsorption onto the modified LDO (with a molar ratio of cation: 3:1, ratio of pectin to LDO: 7% w/w, and temperature: 577 \u25e6C), various kinetic models under Initial HMs concentration (C0) = 180 mg L\u22121, temperature (T) = 25 \u25e6C, adsorbent dose = 1 g L\u22121, Contact Time = 180 min condition were employed. The determination of kinetic model parameters\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3778 19 of 25\nwas conducted using linear regression analysis, considering high R2 values and low SE values (Table 9, Figure 11).\nAs evident from Figure 11, the Qe values for Zn, Cd, Pb, and Ni increase with an extended reaction time (5\u2013180 min). This trend can also be explained by the notion that a high concentration of HMs creates a robust driving force, facilitating ion diffusion from the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3778 20 of 25\nsolution phase to the modified LDO sorbent. Additionally, it enhances the frequency of collisions between the sorbates and the active sites of the sorbent [38]. The Qe values increased up to 60 min (except for Zn), after which they reached equilibrium and showed no further change. The specific timing of these two phases and when they occurred was indicative of the type of HMs present [19]. The initial phase, characterized by rapid sorption rates, lasted approximately 60 min for Ni, Cd, and Pb. In contrast, this initial phase was shorter for Zn, lasting around 30 min. The initial rapid sorption stage was associated with the sorbent\u2019s external surface [35], wherein an abundance of adsorption sites existed, and no inner diffusion limitations were present [39]. The swift achievement of equilibrium in HM sorption indicated the rapid removal of HMs from the aqueous solution [40]. The quick phase at the outset was succeeded by equilibrium due to a reduction in functional group sites [41]. This fast sorption phase denotes strong electrostatic attractions between HMs and the sorbent, while the subsequent slow/equilibrium phase signifies that the active sites on the sorbent\u2019s surface are filled or saturated by HMs [14]. Based on the observations in Figure 10, the order of Qe values for the modified LDO adsorbent in various aqueous solutions containing different HMs generally followed the sequence Zn > Pb > Ni > Cd. This outcome confirmed the EDX results. The Qe value of the modified LDO adsorbent in this study was greater than that of other sorbents used for removing various pollutants, such as Zn-Fe-LDH (74.50 mg g\u22121) [3],\nMn-Al-LDO/biochar (66 mg g\u22121) [42], and Chitosan-PC (32.58 mg g\u22121) [43]. According\nto Table 9 and Figure 12, the laboratory data were best fitted by the pseudo-second-order\nmodel (with R2 of 1 and SE of 0.01 for Zn and R2 of 1 and SE of 0.007 for Pb) and the Elovich\nmodel (with R2 of 0.95 and SE of 0.44 for Cd, and R2 of 0.93 and SE of 0.49 for Ni). These\nmodels exhibited better fitting than other models.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 4\nFigure 11.

Initial HMs concentration (C0) = 180 mg L\u22121, temperature (T) = 25 \u00b0C, adsorbent dose = 1 g L\u22121, and contact time = 5\u2013180 min.\nFigure 12.

Due to this result, the sorption of Zn and Pb is mostly controlled by the chemisorption phenomenon via a chemical reaction between the sorbents and the sorbates [45]. The value of k2 was 0.0007, 0.0005, and 0.001 (g mg\u22121 min\u22121) for Zn, Ni, Pb, and Cd, respectively. These outcomes show that the sorption rate of HMs was in the order of Cd > Zn > Ni = Pb. Moreover, the Elovich model showed that the sorption process of Cd and Ni onto the modified LDO was heterogeneous [46].\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3778 21 of 25\nFigure 12 shows that the Zn Cd, Pb, and Ni plots were divided into two steps. In the initial phase, four studied HMs were absorbed onto the outer surfaces of the sorbent. Then, in the second phase, the HMs diffused into pores and inner surfaces of sorbents (This phenomenon is called intraparticle diffusion) [47]. The final phase of the plot shows the sorption of HMs at equilibrium [48]. In general, the rate of sorption of HMs onto sorbent was controlled by two mechanisms: internal and external diffusion processes. The influence of initial HMs concentration on the Qe (mg g\u22121) and RE (%) of the modified LDO sorbent was investigated (see Figure 11a, Table 9). The Qe values for Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni increased from 8.75 to 96.07, 8.45 to 97.26, 8.91 to 96.07, and 8.22 to 96.02 mg g\u22121, respectively, as the concentration of HMs rose from 10 to 100 mg L\u22121; this indicates that the modified LDO proves to be an efficient sorbent for the sorption of the four studied HMs in contaminated solutions, even at concentrations of up to 100 mg L\u22121. Additionally, the enhancement in Qe for the modified LDO sorbent can be attributed to the simplified contact between the HMs and the active sites of the sorbent. The highest mean RE (%) was achieved for Cd. This outcome underscores that the adsorbent\u2019s capability for HMs removal is not only dependent on the factors affecting the produced adsorbent but also strongly influenced by the type of metal. According to reports from some researchers, the reduction in the value of RE (%) as the concentration of HMs increases is often attributed to the competition between HMs and binding sites on the active sites of the sorbent [49]. However, contrary to certain studies, the present research observed an increase in the RE (%) process. This contrasting result can be attributed to the abundance of active sites and their unsaturation [50]. The adsorption isotherm process provides crucial data that can unveil the mechanism of the adsorption process and shed light on the interactions between sorbate molecules and the surface of the sorbent [51]. Freundlich model was chosen as the excellent equation to explain the behavior of HMs sorption because of its comparatively high R2 and low SE values (Table 10). The Freundlich adsorption isotherm had a linear shape, as shown in Figure 12; it is possible to calculate the kf and 1/n in, which both provide useful information. When the parameter n is between 1 and 10 (1/n less than 1), the sorbent\u2019s surface is heterogeneous, and Zn, Cd, Pb, and Ni are well-suited to the sorption process [52].\nHMs C0 = 10\u2013100 mg L\u22121, T = 25 \u25e6C, adsorbent dose = 1 g L\u22121, contact time = 180 min."

The three parameters considered were the molar ratio of cation, the ratio of LDO/LDH to pectin, and the temperature. The results demonstrated that the modified LDO (LDO-PC composites) prepared under optimal conditions exhibited high efficiency, active sites, irregular shape stability, abundant functional groups, and more cavities compared to other preparation conditions. As reported in previous studies, the Qe of the modified LDO exceeded that of the LDO synthesized using traditional methods. The most influential factors affecting the adsorption capacity were ranked as C > B > A for Zn, B > A for Cd, and B > A > C for Pb and Ni. These findings suggest specific LDO preparation conditions tailored to each HM\u2019s removal might be necessary. The type of metal and the sorbent\u2019s synthesis conditions emerged as the two most critical parameters influencing the RE% of HMs. The experimental data aligned well with the mathematical model, indicating the suitability of RSM. The pseudo-second-order (Initial HMs concentration (C0) = 180 mg L\u22121, temperature (T) = 25 \u25e6C, adsorbent dose = 1 g L\u22121, contact Time = 5\u2013180 min) and Freundlich equations (Initial HMs concentration (C0) 10\u2013100 mg L\u22121, T = 25 \u25e6C, adsorbent dose = 1 g L\u22121, contact time = 180 min) provided the best descriptions for the sorption kinetics and isotherms, respectively. Even after undergoing five cycles of recycling, the RE% of HMs remained above 90%. The main mechanisms behind the adsorption of HMs onto the modified LDO sorbent were electrostatic attraction and chemisorption. In conclusion, the modified LDO represents a promising, eco-friendly, cost-effective, and reusable adsorbent for removing HMs from wastewater. The research outcomes underscored the high predictive potential of both Taguchi and RSM approaches for the adsorption capacity of metals. When comparing these two statistical methods, it becomes evident that RSM offers greater accuracy and considers more interactions, while Taguchi optimizes the number of tests and proves more cost-effective than RSM.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym15183778/s1, Table S1.
