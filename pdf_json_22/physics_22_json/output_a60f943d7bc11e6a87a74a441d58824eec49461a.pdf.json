    "abstractText": "We present a framework for operating a selfadaptive RIS inside a fading rich-scattering wireless environment. We model the rich-scattering wireless channel as being doubleparametrized by (i) the RIS, and (ii) dynamic perturbers (moving objects, etc.). Within each coherence time, first, the self-adaptive RIS estimates the status of the dynamic perturbers (e.g., the perturbers\u2019 orientations and locations) based on measurements with an auxiliary wireless channel. Then, second, using a learned surrogate forward model of the mapping from RIS configuration and perturber status to wireless channel, an optimized RIS configuration to achieve a desired functionality is obtained. We demonstrate our technique using a physics-based end-toend model of RIS-parametrized communication with adjustable fading (PhysFad) for the example objective of maximizing the received signal strength indicator. Our results present a route toward convergence of RIS-empowered localization and sensing with RIS-empowered channel shaping beyond the simple case of operation in free space without fading.",

INTRODUCTION\nWe introduce an artificial intelligence (AI) empowered approach to converging channel estimation and shaping enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in fading rich-scattering wireless environments. The ability of RISs to shape wireless channels within the emerging \u201csmart radio environment\u201d paradigm pivotally relies on channel state knowledge. Most algorithmic explorations of RISs assume that the channels are known, but gaining this channel knowledge once per coherence time in practice will involve significant overhead [1], a realization that has even given rise to ideas for how to use RIS without deterministic channel information [2]\u2013 [4].\nIf the receiver is cooperative, the channels can be measured via pilot signals, as recently studied for RISs in free space [5]\u2013 [7]. Alternatively, and this is the case we focus on, the RIS can be equipped with a sensing functionality to determine itself the channel state information. First efforts to integrate sensing functionalities for channel estimation into RISs have been reported for operation in free space where the problem of channel estimation is comparatively simple, requiring, for instance, only a direction-of-arrival estimation [8]\u2013[12].\nCorresponding Author: Philipp del Hougne.\nBut realistic propagation environments often involve complex fading effects significantly beyond the validity of a simple free-space approximation. Deployment scenarios of RISs inside metallic enclosures such as vessels, planes, trains or busses will give rise to channels with strong multipath characteristics; at low frequencies (< 6 GHz), even office rooms present substantial amounts of reverberation [13], [14]. In such rich-scattering scenarios, the wireless channels are the superposition of many reflected waves arriving from seemingly arbitrary angles such that common free-space intuition and approaches cannot be applied [15]. The complexity of the problem calls for data-driven AI approaches.\nIn our approach, we consider a double-parametrization of the fading rich-scattering wireless channels:\n1) the desired RIS-parametrization. 2) the undesired channel dependence on some dynamic\nchannel-perturbing parameters such as the location of the receiver, the location of moving objects, the orientation of rotating objects, etc.\nWe will thus proceed in three steps: 1) Learn a surrogate forward model to predict the channel as\na function of RIS parameters and perturbing parameters. 2) Estimate the perturbing parameters. 3) Optimize the RIS parameters, given the perturbing\nparameters, to achieve the desired shaping of the wireless channel.\nWhile step 1 is a one-off calibration step for a given scenario, steps 2 and 3 are repeated once within every channel coherence time.\nThe first step of learning a parametrized forward model of complex fading channels cannot be approached analytically in our rich-scattering setting (unlike its free-space counterpart).\nThe second step can build on existing literature for RISassisted sensing in rich-scattering environments. Specifically, a fixed series of random RIS configurations can offer sufficient configurational diversity to estimate the location of a non-cooperative object based on transmission measurements between a single pair of nodes [16], even deeply subwavelength precision with intensity-only measurements is attainable [17]. This is essentially an instance of compressed sensing, where the rich-scattering environment acts as RIS-parametrized coded aperture.

This wave-fingerprinting-based localization technique can be implemented robustly in dynamic environments [18] and it may be possible to learn a shorter task-specific fixed series of RIS configurations to improve latency through \u201clearned sensing\u201d [19]. The related sensing task of object recognition (instead of localization) inside a rich scattering environment has also been implemented with compressed sensing using spectral diversity (broadband measurements) [20].\nThe third step of optimizing the RIS parameters cannot be conveniently implemented by running the forward model from step 1 in reverse with fixed weights and trainable inputs. The reason is the 1-bit (or few-bit) programmability of the RIS elements and the fact that the learned forward model is not guaranteed to interpolate in a physically meaningful way between the discretized inputs from the training data.\nDirectly learning an inverse (instead of forward) model that outputs a suitable RIS configuration as a function of the desired wireless channel and perturber status does not present itself as viable alternative to following steps 1 and 3 because (i) the forward model is a many-to-one mapping (within reasonable precision limits), and (ii) determining desired wireless channel characteristics in accordance with the laws of physics is nontrivial.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we detail our preliminary implementation of the above approach to realizing a selfadaptive RIS for channel sounding and shaping beyond the simple free-space case. To work with the substantially more challenging case of fading rich-scattering channels, we use an\nend-to-end model for RIS-parametrized fading channels that fully complies with wave physics [21]."

First, the self-adaptive RIS estimates the current state of the perturber, \u03b8\u0303, by measuring the field transmitted from TX to AR, HAR\u2212TX , for a fixed series of random RIS configurations. To this end, the artificial neural network (ANN) coined S-ANN is used. Second, based on \u03b8\u0303, the self-adaptive RIS identifies a suitable configuration in order to implement a desired channel shaping functionality. To that end, the RIS uses the simple iterative Algorithm 1; every evaluation of the cost function in Algorithm 1 makes use of a second ANN coined CE-ANN that estimates the channel between TX and RX for a given \u03b8 and C.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: INRIA.

Restrictions apply.\nWe use the ANNs (S-ANN and CE-ANN) as faithful interpolators of functions for which no analytical expression exists.\nRemark 1: For free-space operation, the channel HRX\u2212TX is usually decomposed into the channel from the TX to the RIS, the RIS configuration, and the channel from the RIS to the RX. Such a simple linear cascaded model is not applicable in rich-scattering environments where each path may encounter different RIS elements along its complicated trajectory. The parametrization of the channel HRX\u2212TX through RIS (and dynamic perturbers) is hence highly complicated and analytically intractable, which is why we learn the surrogate forward model CE-ANN.\nRemark 2: The stronger the perturber alters the auxiliary wireless channel HAR\u2212TX , the more accurately S-ANN can estimate \u03b8 with a limited sequence of measurements and/or in the presence of measurement noise [17]. Various implementations of S-ANN (for different sensing tasks and measurement protocols) were reported in Refs. [15]\u2013[20]."

As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the perturbers are four irregularly shaped objects rotating in an uncontrolled manner around their centers. We model the wireless channels with PhysFad [21], a physicsbased end-to-end communication model for RIS parametrized wireless environments with adjustable fading. PhysFad is based on a coupled-dipole formalism constructed from first principles and thereby inherently obeys all essential physical principles, including\n\u2022 a notion of space and causality, \u2022 dispersion (frequency selectivity) and the intertwinement\nof a RIS element\u2019s phase and amplitude response, \u2022 any arising mutual coupling effects, including long-range\nmesoscopic correlations, and \u2022 the non-linear parametrization of wireless channels\nthrough RIS and perturbing objects. PhysFad is formulated, without loss of generality, in arbitrary units such that the central operating frequency as well as the medium\u2019s permittivity and permeability are all defined to be unity [21]. The utilized PhysFad parameters are summarized for the sake of repeatability in Table I \u2013 the interested reader is referred to Ref. [21] for details on PhysFad.\nThe impact of the RIS and/or perturbers on HRX\u2212TX is illustrated in Figs. 2b-d. The standard deviation \u03c3 of the distribution of the complex-valued HRX\u2212TX for random choices of C with fixed \u03b8 (Fig. 2c) is seen to be comparable to that for random choices of \u03b8 with fixed C (Fig. 2d). If both C and \u03b8 are chosen randomly, \u03c3 is of course higher (Fig. 2b).

IV, we test the performance of our self-adaptive RIS for the designated task of optimizing the RSSI on the wireless link HRX\u2212TX for 100 random test instances of the dynamic rich-scattering environment. For each test instance, a random perturber status \u03b8 is chosen. The 10 measurements of the auxiliary channel HAR\u2212TX for the 10 fixed random RIS configurations are made, and an estimate \u03b8\u0303 of the perturber status is obtained. The results in Fig. 3a reveal excellent precision in estimating the perturber status. As noted above, estimating the perturber status is relatively easy for large perturbers as in the considered case.\nHaving obtained \u03b8\u0303 in a given test instance, we next run Algorithm 1 to optimize the RIS configuration for the designated channel shaping functionality (RSSI maximization). The final optimized RIS configuration is evaluated in PhysFad to determine the achieved RSSI improvement independently from the quality of CE-ANN as a surrogate forward model. We also evaluate the RSSI for 500 random RIS configurations as benchmark. The results displayed in Fig. 3b indicate clear RSSI improvements in every test instance for our self-adaptive RIS.

            "text": "We have introduced a paradigm through which a RIS can self-adapt its configuration inside a dynamic rich-scattering environment to reliably implement a desired channel shaping functionality despite dynamic perturbations. The conception of a self-adaptive RIS is particularly challenging to realize in our setting of a rich scattering environment where no simple analytical channel description exists. In practice, our technique will be useful when the channel coherence time is significantly longer than the time it takes our RIS to self-adapt through the procedure summarized in Fig. 1. Current RIS prototypes can refresh their configuration within 20 \u00b5s (e.g., in Ref. [22]), with further room for improved refresh rates, suggesting that our method may serve in many realistic scenarios, e.g., where human motion is the perturbation.\nLooking forward, our technique can be extended to scenes with more complicated dynamics (e.g., complex motion of multiple perturbing objects and moving receiver). In particular, the scalability of our approach to scenarios with more independent perturbers as well as the impact of the SNR on the performance deserve attention. The training procedure to adapt\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: INRIA. Downloaded on November 12,2022 at 13:05:30 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Furthermore, we envision smarter ANNs that anticipate motion and cognitively select intelligent sensing patterns [23]. Overall, it remains to be determined whether the system level advantages of smart radio environments justify the cost of the associated overhead (in our work, going through the procedure summarized in Fig. 1)."
