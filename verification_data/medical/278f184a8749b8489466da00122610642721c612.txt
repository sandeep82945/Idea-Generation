"However, the BN model should be further optimized to better distinguish LFR group from controls by using more sensitive predictors in further research. In addition, we deleted cycles with missing values rather than filling the missing values by using some statistical approaches. However, we compared distributions of the critical variables between excluded (incomplete data) and included (complete data) data. The frequencies of key variables such as the age of the partners, number of retrieved oocytes, insemination method, and infertility type, which directly influenced fertilization in the BN model, were comparable between the included and excluded cycles. This implies that the missing data were likely to be missing at random, and deleting these missing values may not have introduced much bias (Supplementary Table 3)."
