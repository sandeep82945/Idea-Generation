    "abstractText": "Viruses mutate under a variety of selection pressures, allowing them to continuously adapt to their hosts. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have shown effective evasion of population immunity and increased affinity to host factors, in particular to the cellular receptor ACE2. However, in the dynamic environment of the respiratory tract forces act on the binding partners, which raises the question whether not only affinity, but also force-stability of the SARS-CoV-2:ACE2 bond, might be a selection factor for mutations. Here, we use magnetic tweezers (MT) to study the effect of amino acid substitutions in variants of concern (VOCs) on RBD:ACE2 bond kinetics with and without external load. We find higher affinity for all VOCs compared to wt, in good agreement with previous affinity measurements in bulk. In contrast, Alpha is the only VOC that shows significantly higher force stability compared to wt. Investigating the RBD:ACE2 interactions with molecular dynamics simulations, we are able to rationalize the mechanistic molecular origins of this increase in force-stability. Our study emphasizes the diversity of contributions to the assertiveness of variants and establishes force-stability as one of several factors for fitness. Understanding fitness-advantages opens the possibility for prediction of likely mutations allowing rapid adjustment of therapeutics, vaccination, and intervention measures. .

Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have shown effective evasion of population immunity and increased affinity to host factors, in particular to the cellular receptor ACE2. However, in the dynamic environment of the respiratory tract forces act on the binding partners, which raises the question whether not only affinity, but also force-stability of the SARS-CoV-2:ACE2 bond, might be a selection factor for mutations. Here, we use magnetic tweezers (MT) to study the effect of amino acid substitutions in variants of concern (VOCs) on RBD:ACE2 bond kinetics with and without external load. We find higher affinity for all VOCs compared to wt, in good agreement with previous affinity measurements in bulk. In contrast, Alpha is the only VOC that shows significantly higher force stability compared to wt. Investigating the RBD:ACE2 interactions with molecular dynamics simulations, we are able to rationalize the mechanistic molecular origins of this increase in force-stability. Our study emphasizes the diversity of contributions to the assertiveness of variants and establishes force-stability as one of several factors for fitness. Understanding fitness-advantages opens the possibility for prediction of likely mutations allowing rapid adjustment of therapeutics, vaccination, and intervention measures."

            "text": "Viruses constantly adapt to their hosts through genomic changes. While many mutations are silent or inviable, some result in increased fitness by increasing intrinsic transmissibility or evasion of population immunity. Better adaption and higher transmissibility enable new variants to supersede existing ones, as it was observed by the emergence and rapid spread of variants of concern (VOC) of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Figure S1). Adaptations associated with increased fitness of SARSCoV-2 often go along with higher affinity to host factors (1, 2). However, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host factor ACE2 takes place in the dynamic environment of the respiratory tract, where external forces, caused for example by breathing, coughing or mucus clearing by ciliary beating (3, 4), constantly counteract attachment (Figure 1A). In general, for successful infection, not only affinity, but also the stability under force for the attachment to the host can be critical (5-11). How force-stability varies across VOCs and whether it correlates with viral transmissibility is not well understood. Here, we use a highly sensitive single-molecule assay to mimic the natural force-exposure and investigate SARS-CoV-2 attachment to ACE2 under load. Our approach uses a fusion protein construct that features the receptor binding domain (RBD) from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein coupled to the ACE2 ectodomain via a flexible peptide linker with molecular handles suitable for attachment in magnetic tweezers (MT; Figure 1B-D) (12). Coupling in MT enables us to probe the mechanical strength and dynamics of the RBD:ACE2 interaction under precisely defined forces (12) (Figure 1). Using our singlemolecule assay, we characterize the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOC constructs with ACE2. Our assay reveals significant differences in force-stability between the VOCs and we identify the amino acid substitutions responsible for the changes. In addition to force-stability, we find that by extrapolating bond lifetimes to zero force, we can reproduce equilibrium affinity constants measured in bulk. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identify key residues that stabilize the RBD:ACE2 interface and calculate the correlation between their movements. Comparing correlation coefficients for the different VOCs from MD simulations, we are able to accurately reproduce the experimentally determined relations in force-stabilities. Thus, we are able to experimentally determine differences in the force-stability between different VOCs\nusing MT and elucidate their molecular origin with the help of MD simulations. Correlating our results to observations from epidemiology, we suggest that increased force-stability of the ACE2:RBD interface can increase intrinsic transmissibility. We anticipate that taking into account force-stability will aid predictions of future variants of concern."

            "text": "Comparing the force stability of the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2 for VOCs We design fusion protein constructs comprising the ectodomain of the human ACE2 receptor connected by a flexible polypeptide linker to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 for both the wild type (wt) strain and the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta VOCs (Figure 1C,D; Table 1). We attach the tethered ligand constructs to a glass surface and a magnetic bead, respectively, using a previously established protocol based on specific peptide linkers (12-15). Using MT, we probe the stability of the RBD:ACE2 interaction at varying levels of constant forces. At high forces larger than 25 pN, ACE2 unfolds with a characteristic unfolding signature (Supplementary Figure S2), enabling us to identify specific tethers. At forces below 10 pN, where both protein domains are folded, the linker ensures that receptor and ligand remain in proximity upon dissociation, allowing them to re-bind (12, 16-18). We can thus study repeated (re-)binding and dissociation of the same SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 interaction under different forces (Figure 1E). At low forces (< 2 pN), we find the bond to be predominantly formed, while increasing the force leads to elongated periods where the binding partners are dissociated. Quantitating the force dependence of the RBD:ACE2 interaction gives access to both the equilibrium force stability and the dynamics of the interactions. We characterize the force stability by F1/2, the midpoint force, at which it is equally likely to find the system in the bound or dissociated conformation (Figure 1F). We determine F1/2 by fitting a two-state model to the fraction dissociated (fdiss) as a function of force (Figure 1G):\n\ud835\udc53!\"## \ud835\udc39 = !\n(!!!\"# \u00a0(!\u2206!(!!!! ! )/!!!))\n(1)\nwhere kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant and T the absolute temperature. F1/2 and \u2206z are fitting parameters that represent the midpoint force and the distance between the two states along the pulling direction, respectively. The fraction dissociated is calculated for each plateau of constant force by dividing the time spent in the dissociated conformation by the total plateau time. Comparing F1/2 for the wt and the different VOCs (Figure 2A,B and Supplementary Figure S3), we find that the force-stability for the Alpha VOC is highly significantly larger than wt (p = 5.2 \u00b7 10\u20134, two-tailed t-test). In contrast, we observe no statistically significant difference between SARS-CoV-2 wt and Beta (p > 0.80), wt and Gamma (p > 0.26), or wt and Delta (p > 0.99). In addition to the naturally emerged VOCs, we tested individual amino acid substitutions and found that E484K slightly lowers F1/2, albeit not statistically significantly, while K417N lowers the force stability highly significantly (p = 4.5 \u00b7 10\u20135)."

            "text": "To characterize the dynamics of the interactions, we determine the dwell times of the dissociated and bound state as a function of force. The dwell time distributions are well described by single exponentials (Supplementary Figure S4). The resulting mean dwell times, \u03c4diss and \u03c4bound, (Figure 1H, circles) exhibit an exponential force dependence (Figure 1H, lines). The intersection of the fitted dwell times in the dissociated and bound state provides an alternative route to determine the midpoint force F1/2 and we find excellent agreement in both the absolute values and differences across VOCs with the F1/2 values determined using the two-state model (Equation 1; Supplementary Table T1). Further, extrapolation of the fits to zero force, assuming a slip bond behavior, yields lifetimes of the bond in the absence force (Figure 2C, Supplementary Table T1). The lifetimes of the dissociated state increase rapidly with increasing force for all constructs, which is expected as the peptide linker extends under force, which in turn impedes bond\nre-formation (12, 16, 19, 20). Conversely, the lifetimes of the bound state \u03c4bound decrease with force for all VOCs. However, the force dependence of \u03c4bound differs for the different VOCs (Supplementary Figure S5). For Alpha, we find a higher \u03c4bound than for wt over the whole measured force range (Figure 2C), again indicating a higher force-stability of Alpha in this force range, in line with observation of a higher F1/2 for Alpha. The other\nVOCs exhibit overall similar lifetimes in the bound state compared to wt under force, in line with their similar F1/2 values.\nBond lifetimes at zero force predict affinities The force-dependence of the bond lifetime (i.e. the slope in Figure 2C) varies\nconsiderably across the VOCs, leading to very different extrapolated lifetimes \u03c40,bound and \u03c40,diss in the absence of load. The lifetimes at zero force can be related to affinities: the ratio \u03c40, diss/\u03c40, bound (or equivalently the ratio of the rates k0,off / k0,on, which are the inverses of the lifetimes) define unimolecular equilibrium constants for the tethered ligand system KDTL = \u03c40,diss/\u03c40,bound (Supplementary Figure S6). The KDTL are dimensionless, since both on- and off-rates for the tethered ligand systems are in units of 1/s. To compare KDTL to bulk binding measurements, we need to take into account that in standard solution assays the bimolecular equilibrium constant KD,sol = koff,sol / kon,sol has units of M, since while the off-rate koff,sol is directly comparable to k0,off, the on-rate kon,sol is depending on the ligand concentration, with unit of 1/M\u22c5s. Therefore, we normalize both the unimolecular equilibrium constant KDTL and the bimolecular dissociation constants KD,sol obtained using standard binding assays (1, 2, 21-25) (3\u20139) to the wt and compare across the VOCs (Figure 2D). We find good agreement between the affinities determined in our single-molecule assay and the values obtained from standard affinity measurements (Figure 2D), suggesting that our constant force magnetic tweezers measurements are close enough to equilibrium to enable robust extrapolation to zero force. The good agreement between the force spectroscopy data extrapolated to zero force and the bulk binding measurements also implies that the RBD:ACE2 interaction is not a catch bond, but a \u201cregular\u201d slip bond. However, the data also reveal a clear difference between affinities at zero force and stability under mechanical load: While all VOCs exhibit increased affinity compared to wt, only Alpha shows higher force stability. A clear difference between force stability and thermodynamic affinity has been seen for a range of molecular bonds (26, 27) and our findings suggest that force stability must be taken into account as an independent factor when assessing VOCs.\nMolecular basis of different force stabilities across the VOCs To provide a microscopic understanding of the observed differences in force stability, we performed all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the different RBD:ACE2 complexes. The structures of the VOCs were obtained by comparative modeling using Modeller (28), taking the SARS-CoV-2 wt structure as template (12). For each system, 5 replicas were simulated for a total of 1.0 \u00b5s using NAMD 3.0 (29). Trajectories were analyzed with VMD (30) and dynamical network analysis (31), which measures the correlation between the motions of neighboring residues to determine how cooperative their motion is. The higher the correlation between residues, the more relevant is their interaction for the stability of the protein complex (32). We determined contacts by tracking the distance between neighboring residues throughout the simulations, then selected the contacts with highest correlation for further analysis (see Supplementary Figure S7). Using these selection criteria, we identify the main contacts that are responsible for stabilizing the RBD:ACE2 complex (Figure 3A,B) and would thus be expected to have the greatest impact on the force-stability. All residues selected by the network analysis contact criterion are found within the receptor binding motif (RBM, residues N437 to Y508) region, at the RBD:ACE2 interface, defined as 4 \u00c5 cut-off based on the PDB ID 6m0j crystal structure (33) (see Supplementary Figure S8 for individual correlations). The total sum of correlations for RBD residues (Fig. 3C and Supporting Figure S9) highlights mostly hydrophobic residues and also residues that are not mutated in the VOCs, revealing that stabilizing the bond between RBD:ACE2 involves an interplay of different interactions. Mutations in the VOCs lead to a rebalancing of interactions with ACE2, losing correlation in some regions while gaining in others (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure S7). Examining the specific mutations involved in the VOCs, we can rationalize the observed differences in force stability. Alpha carries only one substitution in the RBD, namely N501Y, which is also present in Beta and Gamma. The N501Y substitution creates an additional hydrogen bond and leads to increased pi-stacking with residue Y41 of ACE2 (34), which increases the pairwise correlation (Supplementary Figure S8 and S9) and in particular enhances the correlations in the vicinity of position N501, in particular at residue T500 and G502 (Figure 3C).\nThe Beta and Gamma VOCs feature, in addition to N501Y, amino acid substitutions at position K417N/T and E484K. In the wt, the residues K417 and E484 form salt bridges with residues D30 and K31 of ACE2, respectively (1, 3). Due to a charge-reversal in the case of E484K and a charge removal in the case of K417N (Beta) and K417T (Gamma), these salt bridges are disrupted. The disruption of the salt bridge at position 417 leads to dramatic loss in correlation (Figure 3C), fully in line with a dramatically decreased force stability for K417N (Figure 2B). The charge reversal by the mutation E484K leads to the loss of the salt bridge with K31, which is, however, compensated by an alternative salt bridge with E35 (3). As a result, the correlations around position E484 are virtually unaffected by the mutation (see e.g. residues F486, N487, Y489; Figure 3C), consistent with only a slight and statistically insignificant decrease in F1/2 for the E484K mutation (Figure 2B). In summary, for the Beta and Gamma VOCs, the increased force stability by N501Y is offset by the reduction of stability in particular by K417N/T, such that the total effect is a similar force stability as wt. The mutations in the Delta VOC, L452R and T478K, are located further away from the RBD:ACE2 interface and there are no direct interactions involving these residues. Nonetheless, the Delta mutations do shift the correlation pattern, with correlations in the \u201cPatch 2\u201d region (Figure 3B) around position N501 decreasing and increasing in the region \u201cPatch 1\u201d around P479. To summarize the contact network and the correlations of motion in a single metric and to directly compare to the experimental force stability measurements, we define the total correlation as the sum of all correlations between stable contacts identified through the network analysis. The wt, the experimentally examined VOCs, and also the more recently emerged Omicron VOC were simulated and total correlation scores were computed, using a bootstrapping approach to determine confidence intervals (Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure S10). We find excellent agreement between the total correlation metric and the experimentally determined values for the force stability assessed by F1/2: wt, Beta, Gamma, and Delta exhibit the same force stabilities, while Alpha has a statistically larger F1/2 and total correlation. Interestingly, the recent Omicron variant, which features a very large number of mutations (15 in the RBD alone; (35)), has a total correlation value between Alpha and the wt, and did not show statistically significant differences when compared to Alpha and wt."

            "text": "We have used our tethered ligand assay and exploited the high sensitivity of MT and their ability to measure at constant forces to precisely determine both the force stability and affinity of different SARS-CoV-2 VOCs binding to ACE2. Unlike traditional bulk affinity measurements, our assay provides additional insights into bond-stability and kinetics under mechanical load, mimicking the natural binding circumstances in the dynamic environment of the respiratory tract. We find that while the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta VOCs all have increased affinities to ACE2 compared to wt, only Alpha has higher force stability. Viral fitness depends on multiple factors, including cleavage and cell entry, replication, and viral packing and release (36-41). Correspondingly, the VOCs carry mutations in positions beyond the RBD. However, attachment to the host cell is a critical first step in viral infection and it is instructive to relate trends observed epidemiologically with our findings about the RBD:ACE2 interaction. The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma VOCs variants all emerged in the second half of 2020 and began to circulate widely in late 2020 and early 2021 (Supplementary Figure S1). In Europe and Northern America, Alpha, but not Beta or Gamma, quickly replaced the wt and became the dominantly circulating variant (Supplementary Figure S1). At that time, there was no widespread population immunity in Northern America or Europe (Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting that Alpha, but not Beta or Gamma, has a significant advantage in a (largely) immune-na\u00efve population. We speculate that the higher force stability of Alpha contributes to its epidemiologically observed higher transmissibility compared to wt, Beta, or Gamma. The Beta and Gamma variants became dominant in South Africa and Brazil (Supplementary Figure S1), in a setting where there was already significant population immunity through natural infections (42, 43). The charge change mutations at positions K417 and E484 present in Beta and Gamma reduce the binding of certain neutralizing antibodies (44), but lower the force stability. Consequently, the Beta and Gamma appear to confer an advantage to the virus in population with significant immunity, but not in an immune-na\u00efve population. The Delta and Omicron VOCs became dominant globally in mid 2021 and early 2022, respectively, at a time where there was significant population immunity through both vaccinations and\nnatural infections (Supplementary Figure S1). Both variants show immune escape (25, 45-47) and likely enhanced transmission through substitution at the S1/S2 cleavage site, yet no, or only slightly increased force stability (Figure 2B and Figure 3D) (48-50). These observations raise the possibility that a new variant might emerge that combines the fitness advantages present in Omicron with a higher force stability, which could make it even more transmissible. Our correlation based analysis of the RBD:ACE2 interface by MD simulations and high-resolution force spectroscopy measurements of the interface in the tethered ligand assay has the potential to help understand and ultimately predict the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants."
