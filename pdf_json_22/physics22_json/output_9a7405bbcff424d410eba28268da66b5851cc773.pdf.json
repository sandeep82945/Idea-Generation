INTRODUCTION\nMagnetic skyrmions are particle-like spin textures found in numerous systems1\u20138, including materials in which the skyrmions are stable at room temperature9\u201312. Skyrmions can also be generated by an applied current13\u201320. Due to their size scale, mobility, and stability, skyrmions are promising candidates for a variety of applications21\u201324, many of which require the ability to control how the skyrmions move, how they interact with defects or nanostructures, and how to manipulate them on the individual level. The skyrmions also interact with quenched disorder in the system, giving rise to a pinning effect and establishing a threshold driving force that must be applied for the skyrmion to be set in motion25\u201331. The magnitude of this threshold depends on the properties of the disorder25,32\u201334, collective interactions with other skyrmions35, and thermal effects36\u201338. There are also other types of skyrmions and skyrmion-like textures39, including ferromagnetic1,2 and antiferromagnetic40,41 skyrmions, antiskyrmions42,43, and merons44. For ferromagnetic skyrmions subjected to an applied drive, the skyrmion motion exhibits a skyrmion Hall effect along the skyrmion Hall angle3,45,46 \u03b8sk, which arises from the topology of the skyrmions. The intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle \u03b8intsk is proportional to the ratio of the Magnus or gyrotropic term to the dissipative term of the skyrmion dynamics. Many proposed skyrmion appli-\ncations require the reduction or absence of the skyrmion Hall effect, so there have been numerous studies focused on understanding how to control the skyrmion Hall angle, such as by the use of nanostructures25,31. The magnitude of the skyrmion Hall effect is modified both by the pinning landscape and by the velocity of the skyrmions. Quenched disorder induces a side jump effect that reduces the skyrmion Hall angle below its intrinsic value. The side jump is largest for small velocities just above depinning, giving a skyrmion Hall angle that is zero at depinning and increases with increasing drive until it saturates at a value near \u03b8intsk for high drives\n19,30,38,47\u201355. The skyrmion Hall angle can also be affected by shape distortions of the skyrmions and collisions with other skyrmions30,38,56,57. In addition to the importance of understanding skyrmion dynamics in the presence of disorder for applications, the strong gyrotropic nature of the dynamics means that skyrmions represent a new class of systems that can show collective dynamics when driven over random or periodic substrates. Most previous studies of such behavior have involved overdamped systems25.\nOne approach to generating well-controlled skyrmion motion is to couple the skyrmions to nanostructures, such as a periodic array of defects or other types of engineered landscapes21,22,25,58\u201361. In this case, it is important to understand how individual skyrmions interact with both the defect array and with the other skyrmions. An example of such a system is skyrmions interacting with a two-\n2 dimensional (2D) periodic substrate, where the system can be characterized by a filling factor f corresponding to the ratio of the number of skyrmionsNs to the number of pinning sites Np. When f = Ns/Np is an integer, the skyrmions form a commensurate or ordered crystalline structure. Commensuration effects for particles on 2D substrates have been studied extensively in other condensed matter systems, such as the ordering of atoms or molecules on surfaces62, sliding friction63, colloidal particles on patterned substrates64,65, dusty plasmas66, Wigner crystal ordering in moire\u0300 systems67, vortices in Bose Einstein condensates68, and cold atoms coupled to optical traps69. The closest match to the skyrmion system, however, is vortices in type-II superconductors coupled to 2D pinning arrays70\u201375. At commensuration, the superconducting vortices form an ordered lattice and exhibit a strong enhancement of the pinning effect observable as peaks in the depinning threshold as a function of changing superconducting vortex density.\nCommensurate-incommensurate systems display a rich variety of dynamical phases since the collective motion differs at commensurate and incommensurate fillings25. For example, there can be multiple step depinning, transitions between ordered and disordered flow76,77, and soliton motion78. Particle flow on 2D periodic substrates can be modified significantly depending on the direction of drive with respect to symmetry directions of the underlying substrate. For example, in directional or symmetry locking, the particles preferentially move along certain symmetry directions of the pinning lattice even when the drive is not aligned with those directions, and as a result, for changing drive orientation a series of steps appear in the velocity versus driving angle curves79\u201384. Since the skyrmion Hall angle depends on the magnitude of the drive in systems with pinning, when individual skyrmions move over 2D periodic substrates, numerical studies have shown that the skyrmion motion locks to different substrate symmetry directions as the magnitude of the drive increases48,85,86. For a square array, such locking directions include 0\u25e6 and 45\u25e6 from a primary lattice vector. In general, locking of skyrmions moving on a square array can occur at angles \u03c6 = arctan(n/m) from the primary symmetry axis, with integer n and m; however, the size of the pinning sites as well as interactions with other skyrmions can limit which symmetry directions are accessible. Other studies for skyrmions on 2D pinning arrays indicate that different types of crystalline ordering occur at the matching fields87 and that large scale collective flow states can arise under bulk driving88. In micromagnetic simulations, skyrmions moving on a 2D pinning array exhibit a number of different dynamic phases that could be useful for applications89. In addition, there are now various experiments on skyrmion states in periodic one-dimensional (1D)61 and 2D pinning arrays90.\nIn this work, we examine the dynamics of skyrmions on a 2D square or triangular pinning lattice. We drive a single skyrmion that interacts both with the other skyrmions and directly with the substrate, and\nmeasure the velocity and direction of motion of the driven skyrmion as the system passes through a series of commensurate-incommensurate transitions at varied pinning strength and varied ratios of the Magnus term to the dissipative term. This work builds upon our previous studies examining the dynamics of individually driven superconducting vortices91,92 and skyrmions93,94 interacting with either a background lattice of particles or with pinning. In the case of superconducting vortices where the motion is overdamped, numerous methods to drive individual vortices, including nanotips95,96 and optical trapping97,98, have been studied in experiments and simulations. Individual skyrmions can also be driven with different types of tips99, local magnetic field gradients100,101, and with optical trapping102\u2013104. The method of driving individual particles though a background of other particles while measuring the drag on the driven particle from fluctuations is known as active rheology and has been studied experimentally and theoretically for colloidal particles105\u2013109, granular matter110\u2013112, active matter113, and superconducting vortex systems91,96,114,115.\nIn most active rheology studies, under a constant driving force the velocity of the driven particle decreases as the density of the system increases due to an increase in the frequency of collisions with background particles, and there can be a sudden drop to zero motion or a pinning transition when the system passes through a critical density into a glass, jammed, crystalline, or amorphous solid state. In our previous work on active rheology in a skyrmion system, we considered a single skyrmion driven through a background of other skyrmions in the absence of pinning93. For a constant driving force, we found that the skyrmion Hall angle decreases with increasing skyrmion density due to enhanced collisions; however, particularly for systems with a strong Magnus force, we also found a counter-intuitive increase in the velocity, or a boost effect, in which the skyrmion velocity increases with increasing system density. In some cases, the skyrmion velocity is larger than what it would be in the absence of collisions with other skyrmions. This boost effect arises from a combination of the skyrmion Hall effect and density fluctuations created in the surrounding skyrmions by the driven skyrmion. The density gradient forms perpendicular to the direction of the drive and exerts a repelling force on the driven particle along this direction, but the Magnus term generates a velocity perpendicular to this repelling force and parallel to the drive. This is example of what is known as an oddviscosity effect of the type observed in chiral systems with gyroscopic forces116\u2013119. We have also considered single driven skyrmions interacting with other skyrmions in the presence of random quenched disorder, where in addition to velocity boost phenomena, we observe several pinned and jammed phases as well as stick-slip motion94.\nFor overdamped systems we have also numerically examined the active rheology of superconducting vortices and colloidal particles interacting with 2D periodic pin-\n3 ning arrays as the filling factor of the system is varied. Here we observe what we call an anti-commensuration effect in which the drag on the driven particle is reduced at commensurate matching conditions92, opposite from the behavior found in bulk driven systems70,72\u201375. The drag reduction at commensuration appears when the surrounding particles become strongly coupled to the substrate at matching conditions and cannot be dragged along by the driven particle, whereas at incommensurate fillings, the surrounding particles are much more weakly coupled to the substrate, permitting the driven particle to drag background particles and increasing the effective viscosity it experiences. The result is a strongly nonmonotonic drag that shows a series of peaks at the matching conditions. In the case of an individual skyrmion driven over a 2D periodic array at commensurate and incommensurate conditions, the Magnus force produces much more complex dynamics than are found in the overdamped superconducting vortex system92. In this work we demonstrate that active rheology for a skyrmion driven through a background lattice in the presence of a 2D periodic pinning array produces very different behavior from that found for random pinning94 or in the absence of pinning93. The skyrmion Hall angle is non-monotonic, falling to zero at commensurate conditions where the skyrmions form an ordered lattice and the skyrmion velocity peaks. For strong Magnus forces, the skyrmion Hall angle remains finite but is still reduced at the matching conditions. In general, the skyrmion motion is ordered at commensurate conditions and disordered at incommensurate fillings. For increasing Magnus force, there are more extended regions of finite drive for which the skyrmion remains pinned, a behavior that is the opposite of what is found for bulk driven systems with random pinning. At strong Magnus forces, under commensurate conditions we observe a pronounced velocity boost effect where the driven skyrmion moves faster than it would if there were no substrate and no collisions with other skyrmions. This boost occurs when the direction of motion of the driven skyrmion becomes locked along an interstitial channel and the driven skyrmion experiences a perpendicular repulsion from the skyrmions trapped in the pinning sites, which is converted by the Magnus term to a velocity in the direction of drive. This effect is similar to the velocity enhancement found for skyrmions moving along sample edges120,121. For higher Magnus forces, the motion becomes increasingly chaotic and the effect of the substrate is strongly reduced."

            "text": "We consider a 2D system of size L \u00d7 L with periodic boundary conditions in the x and y directions containing a square pinning array with lattice constant a. The total number of pinning sites is Np, giving a pinning density of np = Np/L\n2. The sample contains Ns interacting skyrmions that are modeled as point particles\naccording to a modified Thiele equation36,49, in which the skyrmions have repulsive interactions with each other and attractive interactions with the pinning sites. We characterize the system by a filling factor f = Ns/Np. For integer values of f , the system is commensurate and adopts a defect-free crystalline ordering, while for incommensurate fillings, the system either becomes amorphous or forms a crystalline state containing interstitials or vacancies25. For certain fractional fillings, such as f = 1/2 or f = 3/2, the system can be partially ordered122,123. Each pinning site has a finite spatial extent, so individual skyrmions can sit either inside a pinning site or in the interstitial regions between the pinning sites depending on the filling factor and the pinning strength. From previous studies of superconducting vortices interacting with 2D square periodic pinning arrays, it is known that the particles will form a square lattice with all of the pinning sites occupied for f = 1.0, a checkerboard pattern with half of the particles in interstitial sites at f = 2.0, an ordered lattice of dimers at f = 3.0, and a hexagonal lattice at f = 4.071,73,74,124. The initial skyrmion positions are obtained by performing simulated annealing from a high temperature molten state down to T = 0, as in previous work73. After the system is initialized, we insert an additional interstitial skyrmion that is coupled to an applied driving force. This driven particle interacts both with the pinning sites and with the other skyrmions. The equation of motion for skyrmion i is given by\n\u03b1dvi + \u03b1mz\u0302\u00d7 vi = F ss i + F p i + F D i (1)\nwhere the skyrmion velocity is vi = dri/dt. The first term on the left with damping constant \u03b1d is the dissipation that aligns the skyrmion motion in the direction of the net applied force. The second term on the left is the Magnus force of magnitude \u03b1m that generates a velocity component perpendicular to the net force. The skyrmion-skyrmion interaction is described by Fssi =\u2211Ns\nj=1 K1(rij)r\u0302ij , where the distance between skyrmion i and skyrmion j is rij = |ri \u2212 rj |, r\u0302ij = (ri \u2212 rj)/rij , and K1 is the modified Bessel function which decays exponentially for large r36. The pinning sites are modeled as finite-range parabolic potential traps of radius rp that exert a maximum pinning force of Fp, giving F p i = \u2211Np k=1(Fp/rp)(ri\u2212r (p) k )\u0398(rp\u2212|ri\u2212r (p) k |)r\u0302 (p) ik , where \u0398 is the Heaviside step function. We fix the pinning density to np = Np/L\n2 = 0.4882 throughout this work. The driving force is FD = FDx\u0302 for the driven skyrmion and FD = 0 for all of the other background skyrmions, and the driving is always applied along the positive x direction. In the absence of other skyrmions or pinning, the driven skyrmion will move with an intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle of \u03b8intsk = arctan(\u03b1m/\u03b1d). Pinning and skyrmion-skyrmion collisions can modify the observed skyrmion Hall angle, \u03b8sk = arctan(\u3008Vy\u3009/\u3008Vx\u3009), where \u3008Vx\u3009 is the average velocity along the driving direction and \u3008Vy\u3009 is the average velocity perpendicular to the\n4 x y\nFIG. 1.

This constraint ensures that we always have \u3008V \u3009 = (\u3008Vx\u3009 2 + \u3008Vy\u3009\n2)1/2 = 1.0 for FD = 1.0 in the absence of pinning regardless of the value of \u03b8intsk . It also makes a velocity boost easy to detect, since for example if FD = 1.0, there is a boost whenever \u3008V \u3009 > 1.0. We increment FD from zero to a maximum value, spending 2 \u00d7 106 to 5 \u00d7 106 simulation time steps at each driving force increment in order to obtain a stationary state average velocity measurement."

The dashed lines in (b) and (e) are at \u3008V \u3009 = 1.0, showing that there is a small boost effect in panel (e) for f < 1.0.\nbut there is a smaller peak at f = 0.66. In Fig. 5(e) we observe regions over which \u3008V \u3009 > 1.0, indicated by locations where the curve rises above the dashed line. This is a signature of a velocity boost produced by interactions with the background skyrmions and the pinning sites. In general, as the density increases, there are more collisions with the background skyrmions that increase the effective dissipative velocity; however, since the collisions can also contribute to the odd viscosity, there is a competition between the viscosity components. When the odd viscosity term dominates, the velocity boost effect can emerge93,94. For a sample with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 2.065 and \u03b8 int sk = \u221264\n\u25e6, we plot \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk versus f in Fig. 6(a,b,c). The peaks that appeared in \u3008V \u3009 at f = 1.0 and f = 2.0 for lower \u03b1m/\u03b1d have not only disappeared, but there is now a dip in \u3008V \u3009 at f = 1.0 accompanied by a small increase in the magnitude of \u03b8sk. A velocity boost appears over the entire range 0.1 < f < 1.0, as indicated by the curve rising above the dashed \u3008V \u3009 = 1.0 line in Fig. 6(b). There is an increase in \u3008Vx\u3009 over the same range of fillings since the boosted velocity is aligned with the driving or +x direction, and, when the Magnus force is large enough, the magnitude of the boost increases as the magnitude of the skyrmion Hall angle \u03b8sk decreases\n93. We plot the same quantities for a sample with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 4.92 and \u03b8intsk = \u221278\n\u25e6 in Fig. 6(d,e,f). Here there is no large feature at f = 1.0; instead, strong peaks or dips appear in \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009 and \u3008V \u3009 at f = 2.0. For this filling, \u03b8sk = \u221245\n\u25e6, indicating that the commensurate structure is directionally locked with one of the major symmetry angles of the pinning array. As f increases further, the magnitude of \u03b8sk resumes its decrease after passing through the locking step at \u03b8sk = \u221245 \u25e6.

In Fig. 6(d), \u3008Vx\u3009 increases with increasing f while the magnitude of \u3008Vy\u3009 undergoes a moderate decrease. Figure 6(e) shows that a velocity boost is present over the entire range of f except at very small values of f , with the largest boost appearing at f = 2.0. At this filling, \u3008V \u3009 \u2248 1.8, nearly twice as large as the expected velocity in the limit of a single skyrmion and no substrate.\nTaken together, the results in this section indicate that commensuration effects can both reduce the skyrmion Hall angle and also speed up the skyrmion motion, two features that are desirable for applications. For values of \u03b1m/\u03b1d higher than what is shown here, we observe similar trends; however, as the relative strength of the damping term becomes small, the motion becomes increasingly disordered and fluid-like, the curves become smooth, and the directional locking effects disappear. In addition, for values of f higher than those shown here, the velocity boost is eventually destroyed. For lower FD and high fillings, a jamming effect can occur in which the driven skyrmion becomes pinned or jammed due to its strong interactions with the background skyrmions, similar to what is found in other active rheology systems105,125."

In general, we find ordered motion at commensurate fillings for which \u03b8sk = 0\n\u25e6 and disordered motion at incommensurate fillings where \u03b8sk is finite. In Fig. 7(a,b,c) we plot the time series of the instantaneous velocities Vx and Vy for the system in Fig. 2 with \u03b8intsk = \u221245 \u25e6. At f = 0.62 in Fig. 7(a), where \u03b8sk = \u221228 \u25e6, the velocities fluctuate rapidly and, as shown in the corresponding velocity distribution plots P (Vx) and P (Vy) in Fig. 7(d), the distributions have a broadened Gaussian form that is characteristic of random fluctuations. At f = 1.0 in Fig. 7(b,e), the motion is periodic and P (Vy) is centered at zero. Here the velocity distributions are non-Gaussian and have sharp features indicative of the repeated periodic motion. In Fig. 7(c,f) at f = 1.14, corresponding to the motion with \u03b8sk = \u221210\n\u25e6 illustrated in Fig. 3(b), the flow is once again random with Gaussian velocity distributions. We find similar behaviors for commensurate and incommensurate fillings at other values of \u03b1m/\u03b1d, including the \u3008Vy\u3009 = 0 states at f = 1.0 and f = 2.0 where the motion is periodic. For higher values of \u03b1m/\u03b1d such as \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 1.33 in Fig. 5(f), where \u03b8sk does not reach zero but is strongly reduced at f = 1.0 and f = 2.0, the motion is mostly periodic with occasional jumps in the transverse direction.\nThe skyrmion motion can also be characterized by examining the velocity noise, as considered in both simulations52 and experiments126. From the time series in Fig. 7, we can extract the power spectrum S\u03b1(\u03c9) = | \u222b V\u03b1(t)e \u2212i\u03c9tdt|2, where \u03b1 = x, y.

At f = 0.62 in Fig. 8(a) there are no peaks in the power spectra, indicating that the motion is random, while at f = 1.0 in Fig. 8(b), there is a strong narrow band noise signal as indicated by the sequence of peaks. In this case there are two overlapping periodic signals. The first, at higher frequencies, arises from the periodic motions of the driven skyrmion as it interacts with the ordered commensurate pinned skyrmions. The second, at lower frequencies, is produced by a small number of defects that are present in the commensurate configuration, which generate a time-of-flight velocity signature. For the disordered motion at f = 1.14 in Fig. 8(c), the noise signature has a broad band character. There is a weak periodic signal at higher frequencies due to the low value of \u03b8sk at this filling, which causes the skyrmion to flow through an interstitial channel between two adjacent pinning rows with infrequent but roughly periodic hops occurring from one interstitial channel to the next.\nIn Fig. 9 we use the behavior of the transport curves and \u03b8sk to construct a dynamic phase diagram as a function of filling fraction f versus \u03b1m/\u03b1d for the system in Fig. 2. In the red region, the skyrmion moves strictly along the direction of drive and \u03b8sk = 0\n\u25e6. In the blue region, the skyrmion Hall angle is finite but there is no velocity boost, and in the green region, there is both a finite skyrmion Hall angle and a finite velocity boost.

Dynamic phase diagram as a function of filling fraction f versus \u03b1m/\u03b1d for the system in Fig. 2 with a square pinning array, Fp = 0.25, and FD = 1.0 constructed using the features in the transport curves and the behavior of \u03b8sk. In the red region, \u03b8sk = 0.0 \u25e6, a condition that extends out to higher \u03b1m/\u03b1d at commensurate fillings. In the blue region, \u03b8sk is finite but there is no velocity boost, while in the green region, \u03b8sk remains finite and a velocity boost appears.\nthe commensurate conditions of f = 1.0 and f = 2.0, the window of zero skyrmion Hall angle extends out to larger values of \u03b1m/\u03b1d. For these same commensurate conditions, even when the value of \u03b8sk becomes finite, it is still suppressed relative to its value away from commensuration, a feature that is not illustrated in the plot.\nIV. VELOCITY FORCE CURVES\nWe next consider the effect of varying the driving force FD on the driven particle in the system from Fig. 2. In Fig. 10(a) we plot \u3008Vx\u3009 and \u3008Vy\u3009 versus FD at f = 0.62. There is a single depinning threshold at FD = 0.6, above which motion occurs simultaneously in both directions. Figure 10(b) shows the corresponding \u03b8sk versus FD, where \u03b8sk = 0\n\u25e6 at the depinning threshold. As FD increases, the magnitude of \u03b8sk gradually increases until it approaches the intrinsic value \u03b8intsk = \u221245\n\u25e6 at higher drives. In Fig. 10(c), \u3008Vx\u3009 and \u3008Vy\u3009 versus FD for a sample with f = 1.0 reveal the presence of a two step depinning threshold. The first depinning transition occurs at FD = 0.55, and for 0.55 < FD < 1.25 the motion is only along the x-direction with \u03b8sk = 0\n\u25e6. The second depinning transition occurs at FD = 1.25, above which finite motion in the y direction appears. In the corresponding plot of \u03b8sk versus FD in Fig. 10(d), \u03b8sk is zero above the first depinning transition and begins to increase in magnitude above the second depinning transition. There are also several steps or plateaus in the velocity, including one with \u03b8sk \u223c \u221227\n\u25e6 and another with \u03b8sk = \u221245 \u25e6.

There is a combination of ordered and disordered motions, with regions in which the skyrmion translates by a distance 2a in the x direction and \u2212a in the y direction, combined with regions in which the skyrmion makes occasional jumps in other directions.

The time series of Vy for a non-step region at FD = 3.25 with partially periodic motion appears in Fig. 12(b), and the broadened signature of the corresponding F (\u03c9) is shown in Fig. 12(d). In general, as a function of increasing FD we find that in regimes of directional locking where there are steps in \u03b8sk, the periodic motion produces narrow band velocity noise, while in regimes where no steps are present, the motion is more disordered and the velocity noise is either broad band or contains weakly periodic signals.\nFor individual skyrmions moving over a square substrate in the absence of background skyrmions, previous work showed that the velocity-force curve and skyrmion Hall angle exhibit a series of steps corresponding to directional locking centered on the values \u03b8sk = arctan(n/m) with m,n integer48. For the active rheology situation we consider here, due to the large number of collisions the driven skyrmion experiences with background skyrmions, only the most prominent locking steps are visible, as illustrated in Fig. 10(d). In general, higher order directional locking only occurs at the commensurate conditions of f = 1.0 and f = 2.0, but there is some weaker higher order locking at some incommensurate fillings as well. The number of accessible steps also depends on the value of \u03b1m/\u03b1d; as this quantity becomes larger, a greater number of steps beyond 1/1 can be accessed.\nIn Fig. 13(a,b) we plot \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, and \u03b8sk versus FD for the system from Fig. 10 at a filling fraction of f = 1.1392.

There is a reduced 1/2 locking step, but the 1/1 locking step remains robust. In Fig. 14(a) we illustrate the skyrmion trajectories in a subsection of the sample at FD = 6.0 on the 1/1 locking step, where the driven skyrmion moves at \u221245\u25e6 through an interstitial channel in the checkerboard lattice formed by the background skyrmions.

In Fig. 15(a,b,c) we plot \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk versus f for a sample with Fp = 0.125, which is half the value of Fp used in Fig. 2. The general trends remain unchanged, with the magnitude of \u03b8sk dropping to zero at f = 1.0 and reaching a value close to zero at f = 2.0. Figure 15(d,e,f) shows the same quantities in a sample with stronger pinning, Fp = 0.5. The shapes of the curves remain similar to those at lower Fp, but there is now a finite window of f near f = 2.0 where \u03b8sk = 0\n\u25e6. In Fig. 16(a,b,c) we plot \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk versus f for the same system in Fig. 15 but at stronger pinning of Fp = 0.625. There are now regions, such as near f = 1.0, where the system is pinned. There are also extended regions near f = 2.0 and f = 3.0 where \u03b8sk is close to zero. The pinned phase arises from the interaction between the driven skyrmion and the pinning sites, which occurs both directly when the driven skyrmion encounters a pinning site, and indirectly when the driven skyrmion experiences a repulsion from a pinned skyrmion. At low f , the driven particle has only direct interactions with the pinning sites, and as long as FD/Fp > 1.0, it will not become pinned. At large f , all of the pinning sites are occupied by background skyrmions and the driven skyrmion never encounters a pinning site directly; however, for certain incommensurate fillings at which the positions of the background skyrmions become disordered,\n10\nthe driven skyrmion can become pinned via interactions with skyrmions located at pinning sites. The plots of \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk versus f in Fig. 16(d,e,f) for the same system at Fp = 0.75 show that motion only occurs for f < 0.05 and f > 2.0 with a broad pinned window appearing in between those fillings, while the magnitude of \u03b8sk remains below 10 \u25e6 for the higher fillings.\nUsing the features in the transport curves and \u03b8sk, in Fig. 17 we construct a dynamic phase diagram as a function of Fp versus f for the system in Figs. 15 and 16 with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 1.0 and FD = 1.0. A large pinned region\nappears at larger Fp. There are some smaller pinned regimes (not shown) above f = 2.1. The intervals of pinning also depend strongly on FD. When \u03b8sk \u2248 0\n\u25e6, the motion is locked to the x direction, shown as red regions. For low f where there are few interactions with background skyrmions, the brown region indicates that the motion is locked to \u03b8sk = 45\n\u25e6. At these low values of f , pinned states occur only when Fp > FD = 1.0. In the blue region, \u03b8sk is finite and there is no boost effect. Near the border between the flowing and pinned regimes, there are some windows of stick-slip motion which produce 1/f velocity fluctuation noise and a bimodal velocity distribution with a peak at \u3008V \u3009 = 0.0 and a second peak at higher velocities.\nWe next consider a sample with strong pinning of Fp = 0.75 and FD = 1.0 where we vary \u03b1m/\u03b1d. In Fig. 18(a) we plot \u3008Vx\u3009 and \u3008Vy\u3009 versus f for a system with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 0.1 and \u03b8 int sk = \u22125.74\n\u25e6. In this case, \u3008Vy\u3009 = 0 over the entire range of f measured. There are two pinned intervals with \u3008Vx\u3009 = 0 at 0.075 < f < 0.92 and 1.6 < f < 2.07. For low f , the driven skyrmion moves along the pinning rows in the x-direction. As f increases, the driven skyrmion begins to collide with other skyrmions and becomes pinned by the combination of the pinning and the interactions with the background skyrmions. Near f = 1.0 where the system is more ordered, the driven skyrmion channels along the x direction between the pinned skyrmions. Near f = 0.8, the background skyrmions are disordered enough that the driven skyrmion trajectory begins to divert into the y direction, but the driven skyrmion quickly becomes trapped among the background skyrmions. For f > 2.0, there are re-\n11\ngions where the driven skyrmion depins and shepherds some of the background skyrmions along the x direction. Figure 18(b) shows \u3008Vx\u3009 and \u3008Vy\u3009 for a sample with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 0.58 and \u03b8 int sk = \u221230\n\u25e6. For low f , the skyrmion Hall angle is finite. There is also a reduced window near f = 1.0 where the driven skyrmion channels along the x direction. Figure 18 demonstrates that increasing the Magnus component of the dynamics enhances the effectiveness of the pinning, a behavior opposite from what is typically observed in systems with random pinning25. The high Magnus force causes the driven skyrmion to attempt to move partially in the y direction rather than strictly along the x direction, and since the direction of motion no longer coincides with a symmetry direction of the pinning lattice, encounters with pinning and pinned skyrmions happen more frequently and increase the effectiveness of the pinning.\nIn Fig. 19(a,b,c) we plot \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk versus f for a sample with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 2.06 and \u03b8 int sk = \u221264.15\n\u25e6. From 0.41 < f < 1.08, there is an unpinned region with motion locked to \u221245\u25e6, as indicated by the 1/1 label in Fig. 19(c). There is a pinned region for 1.08 < f < 2.16 followed by another region in which motion occurs in both the x and y directions. Notice that when f = 0, \u3008Vx\u3009 = 0.44, but that in the range 0.41 < f < 1.0, \u3008Vx\u3009 \u2248 0.9, indicating a substantial boost of the velocity in the direction of driving. There is also a boost in the overall velocity for 1.08 < f < 2.16, as shown in Fig. 19(b) where \u3008V \u3009 rises above the dashed line marking \u3008V \u3009 = 1.0. Figure 19(d,e,f) shows \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk versus f for a sample with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 3.04 and \u03b8intsk = \u221271.8\n\u25e6. The pinned regions are reduced in width and occur away from the commensurate fillings. There is still directional locking to \u03b8sk = \u221245\n\u25e6 near f = 1.0, as indicated in Fig. 19(f) by the 1/1 label, and the velocity\nboosted regime in Fig. 19(e) is more extended. In Fig. 20(a,b,c) we plot \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk versus f for a system with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 4.39 and \u03b8 int sk = \u221277.16\n\u25e6. There is a single pinned region near f = 0.5 and a peak in the magnitude of \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, and \u3008V \u3009 at f = 2.0, but there is no peak near f = 1.0. The peak near f = 2.0 falls at the end of an extended window of locking to \u221245\u25e6, shown as the 1/1 step in \u03b8sk in Fig. 20(c). Over most of the range of f shown, there is a strong velocity boost in \u3008V \u3009, as indicated by \u3008V \u3009 running above the \u3008V \u3009 = 1.0 line in Fig. 20(b). Figure 20(d,e,f) shows \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk for a sample with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 13.28 and \u03b8 int sk = \u221285.7\u25e6, where there is no longer a pinned phase and only a small 1/1 locking step appears near f = 3.0. Here the magnitude of \u03b8sk decreases nearly monotonically with increasing f , while \u3008V \u3009 shows an increasing velocity boost as f becomes larger. For large Magnus forces such as this, the dynamics become increasingly disordered, destroying the directional locking. From the features in the transport curves and the behavior of \u03b8sk for the system in Figs. 18, 19, and 20, we construct a dynamic phase diagram as a function of f versus \u2212\u03b8intsk in Fig. 21. We highlight the pinned phase, locking to the x direction with \u03b8sk = 0\n\u25e6, locking to \u03b8sk = \u221245\n\u25e6 or the 1/1 direction, locking to \u03b8sk = arctan(1/2) or the 1/2 direction, and motion at a finite skyrmion Hall angle. No distinction is made between regions with and without a velocity boost in this figure. For \u2212\u03b8intsk < 45\n\u25e6, there are extended regions of locking in the x-direction, while the additional directional locking effects appear only for higher Magnus fores with \u2212\u03b8intsk > 60\n\u25e6. Near f = 1.0 and 2.0, we find extended regions where \u03b8sk = 0\n\u25e6. There are extended regions of velocity boosting (not shown) which appear when \u2212\u03b8intsk > 45 \u25e6.\n12"

            "text": "If the square pinning array is replaced with a triangular pinning array, similar behavior occurs. In Fig. 22(a,b,c) we plot \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk versus f for a sample with triangular pinning, Fp = 0.5, FD = 1.0, \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 1.0, and \u03b8intsk = \u221245.0\n\u25e6. Here \u03b8sk goes to zero at f = 1.0 but not at f = 2.0. For a triangular pinning array, the back-\nground skyrmions form a commensurate triangular lattice at f = 1.0; however, at f = 2.0 the skyrmions form a honeycomb structure rather than a triangular lattice. A similar structure has been observed for superconducting vortices on a 2D triangular pinning array73. Since the honeycomb arrangement is less stable than the triangular arrangement, the background skyrmions are not as strongly pinned at f = 2.0 compared to f = 1.0, and there is less reduction of the drag on the driven skyrmion at f = 2.0. Figure 22(d,e,f) shows \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk versus f for the same sample at \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 1.73 and \u03b8intsk = \u221260\n\u25e6, where the skyrmion Hall angle does not show any feature at f = 1.0. There is a small velocity boost for f < 1.0, as indicated by the excursion of \u3008V \u3009 above the value \u3008V \u3009 = 1.0 in Fig. 21(e).\nIn Fig. 23(a,b,c) we plot \u3008Vx\u3009, \u3008Vy\u3009, \u3008V \u3009, and \u03b8sk versus f for a triangular pinning system with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 0.374 and \u03b8intsk = \u221220.5\n\u25e6. There is a pinned region near f = 0.4 along with a region of \u03b8sk = 0.0\n\u25e6 centered at f = 1.0 that coincides with a peak in the magnitudes of \u3008Vx\u3009 and \u3008Vy\u3009. Figure 23(d,e,f) shows the same quantities in a sample with \u03b1m/\u03b1d = 0.658 and \u03b8 int sk = \u221233.4\n\u25e6, where a peak appears in \u3008Vx\u3009 and \u3008V \u3009 for f = 1.0. We do not see the same commensurate effects at f = 2.0 due to the honeycomb ordering.\nFigure 24(a) illustrates the skyrmion trajectories for the system in Fig. 22(a,b,c) at f = 0.6 where the skyrmion motion is along \u03b8sk \u2248 \u221218\n\u25e6. The driven skyrmion interacts both directly with the pinning sites and with the background skyrmions, and its trajectory is disordered. In Fig. 23(b), the same system at f = 1.0 exhibits channeling motion along the \u03b8sk = 0\n\u25e6 symmetry direction of the pinning array.\n13"

            "text": "We expect our results should be robust for any pinning geometries where commensuration effects occur. At matching fillings where the background skyrmions are ordered, the skyrmion Hall angle will be reduced and there can be a velocity boost effect. Other possible pinning array geometries include rectangular127,128, 1D periodic129 or even quasiperiodic130,131. We also expect that thermal effects could enhance some of the phenomena we observe. For example, at commensurate conditions the system forms an ordered structure that should be more resistant to thermal fluctuations, while at incommensurate fillings, the effectiveness of the pinning is reduced so that creep effects should be more prominent. In superconducting vortex systems with periodic pinning, commensuration effects are generally enhanced at higher temperatures. This effect could also be important when the point particle approximation breaks down, such as if multiple skyrmions become trapped at a single pinning site and experience shape distortions, or if internal skyrmion modes are excited. We also expect that this system could exhibit a variety of phase locking phenomena113,132 if ac driving were introduced. Such effects should be strongly enhanced near commensurate conditions. Our results should be general to other systems coupled to periodic\nsubstrates where gyroscopic effects come into play."

            "heading": "VIII. SUMMARY",
            "text": "We have numerically examined the dynamics of individual skyrmions driven through an assembly of other skyrmions in the presence of a two-dimensional periodic pinning array. The Magnus force causes the driven skyrmion to move with a finite skyrmion Hall angle. Under a constant driving force, we find a non-monotonic dependence of the skyrmion Hall angle on the density of the background skyrmions. In general, the skyrmion Hall angle drops to zero or is reduced in magnitude at commensurate conditions when the number of skyrmions is equal to an integer multiple of the number of pinning sites. There is also a peak in the net skyrmion velocity at the commensurate filling. At incommensurate fillings, the skyrmion Hall angle becomes finite again, but there is generally a decrease in the skyrmion Hall angle with increasing filling fraction. At commensurate fillings we find a two step depinning process and the motion of the driven skyrmion is well ordered, while at incommensurate fillings there is a single step depinning transition with disordered motion. For larger Magnus forces, additional locking effects can appear in which the motion of the driven skyrmion locks to different symmetry directions of the pinning lattice. In some cases, we find that increasing the Magnus force can enhance the effectiveness of the pinning, which is opposite to the behavior observed in a system with random pinning. This occurs because the Magnus force reduces the amount of channeling along the x direction. We show that our results are robust for both square and triangular pinning arrays. We also map out dynamical phase diagrams as a function of varied pinning strength, Magnus force contribution, and filling fraction."
