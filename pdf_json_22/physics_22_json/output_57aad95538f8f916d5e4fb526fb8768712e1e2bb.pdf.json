    "abstractText": "The graphene/poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composites are a promising candidate for electronic, optoelectrical, and environmental applications. Understanding the mechanical degradation of PMMA-based materials is of practical importance in improving the reliability and lifespan of the associated structures and systems. In this study, we investigate the effects of functionalized graphene (FG) and UV irradiation on the stress\u2013relaxation of PMMA. Uniaxial tensile and stress \u2013relaxation tests are performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the composites. The mechanical strength and elongation at the break increase with the graphene concentration but decrease with the increase of the irradiation dose. Raman spectroscopy and intrinsic viscosity measurement are applied to examine the root cause of the degradation in the composites. UV irradiation leads to polymer chain scission and loss of molecular weight. The Kelvin representation of the standard linear solid model (SLSM) is used to describe the stress\u2013relaxation curves of the composites. The value of the elastic modulus in the Kelvin element decreases with the increase in temperature. The viscosity follows the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy of viscosity increases with the increasing FGs concentration because the FGs hinder the chain motion of PMMA. However, UV irradiation makes chain scission of PMMA/FGs composite so that the polymer chain moves more easily and the activation energy of stress relaxation lowers. The steady-state stress follows the van \u2019t Hoff equation that stress relaxation is an exothermal deformation process. Although Maxwell\u2019s representation of SLSM is mathematically identical to the Kelvin representation of SLSM, the former cannot interpret the stress\u2013relaxation behavior of PMMA/FGs composite, which is against the concept of Young\u2019s modulus as a decreasing temperature function.",

            "text": "Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a thermoplastic and versatile polymer. PMMA possesses good mechanical properties, fabricability, and biocompatibility, which means it can be used in a variety of applications, such as in optical, biomedical, and communication industries [1\u20134]. The methyl group (CH3) is a pendant group of PMMA and prevents the polymer chain from intimating close to forming a crystalline structure, which causes PMMA to be amorphous and results in transparency and low density. The pendant group blocks the polymer chain slip and leads to PMMA being brittle [5]. Due to its biocompatibility, PMMA is regarded as an ideal organic glass material and is manufactured to be an artificial intraocular lens to substitute for damaged human lenses [6]. The brittleness and low-glass transition temperature of PMMA limits its applications. Three methods have been extensively investigated to modify the structure and improve PMMA properties. There are comonomer, additives, and filler mixing. In the comonomer strategy, a small number of comonomers are added and polymerized with methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomers to synthesize the copolymer. Gupta et al. prepared MMA and\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4192. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14194192 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nmethacrylic acid monomers in different ratios and produced copolymers [7]. The addition of methacrylic acid up to 25 wt% reduced the microbial adhesion without significantly affecting the flexural strength. For the second strategy, additives such as stabilizers and plasticizers are added to polymers to change their properties. Street et al. [8] mixed MMA with self-dimerizing hydrogen bond monomer, UPyMA, to polymerize the p(MMA-r-UPyMA) copolymer. The additives of UPyMA into MMA can overcome the mechanical limitation for 3D printed material without affecting melt processability. For the last strategy, filler addition is the most popular approach to improve PMMA performance. Chew et al. [9] blended ceramic fillers, SiO2 and Al2O3, into PMMA-based polymer electrolytes to increase the number of charge carriers, and enhance electrolyte conduction. Sun et al. [10] conducted the solution mixing between colloidal zinc oxide quantum dots of a uniform 5 nm particle size and PMMA matrix. The PMMA/ZnO composite films showed high UV shielding efficiency and good transparency. Avella et al. [11] synthesized PMMA/CaCO3 composites using in-situ polymerization to improve the mechanical properties, in which the abrasive resistance of the composite was increased due to the fine dispersion of the nanoparticles. Graphene possesses extraordinary mechanical properties, good thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity due to its unique carbon atom arrangement [12\u201314]. Those remarkable properties promote graphene as an ideal filler to enhance the polymer composite performance. However, the strong van der Waals force between the nanosheet layers causes graphene agglomeration and results in poor dispersion [15]. Several studies added a surfactant or functionalized graphene nanosheet [16]. They were investigated and focused on the graphene dispersion in the polymer matrix. Wan et al. used Triton X-100 to improve the graphene dispersion in an epoxy matrix and enhanced the thermal stability of epoxy/graphene composites [17]. Goncalves et al. [18] synthesized PMMA/Graphene Oxide (GO) composites via atom transfer radical polymerization and improved the mechanical properties, including Young\u2019s modulus, elongation at break, and tensile strength with 1 wt% GO addition. Ramanathan et al. [19] manufactured PMMA/graphene composites using the solution mixing method and found the glass transition temperature had a 30 \u25e6C increase and elastic modulus a 33% increase by adding only 0.01 wt% FGs. To avoid graphene agglomeration, there is an alternative strategy based on the polymerization occurring in the interlayer spaces of graphite or graphite intercalation compounds [20\u201322]. When the polymers are irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light, polymer degradation happens. UV irradiation leads to photodegradation and results in polymer chain scission and molecular weight reduction [23]. The mechanical properties of polymers, such as fracture stress, elongation at break, and Young\u2019s modulus, are weakened after UV exposure and the polymers become brittle [24,25]. PMMA irradiated by UV with wavelengths of 193 nm, 248 nm, and 308 nm and different doses were investigated by Wochnowski et al. [26]. The crosslinking reaction of the ester side chain between two PMMA molecular chains led to the UV-curing process in wavelengths below 250 nm and low UV dose. The side chain was cleaved from the polymer main chain at medium doses. The chain scission occurred at a high dose and resulted in the polymer structure defragmentation. Studies of the mechanical behavior of polymeric composites have included the fracture, tensile strength, hardness, deformation, and stability of various forms. This paper focused on stress\u2013relaxation behavior. The variation of stress with time is monitored when the materials are subjected to constant strain at different temperatures. Many models were proposed to interpret the viscoelastic behavior of the polymers [27\u201336]. Kohlrausch\u2013 Williams\u2013Watts function is an empirical formula and is most popularly used to describe stress\u2013relaxation behavior [27\u201329]. The standard linear solid model (SLSM) is an alternative to model stress\u2013relaxation behavior [30\u201333]. Ariyama et al. fitted the stress\u2013relaxation data of polypropylene by Kelvin representation of SLSM and calculated the activation energy of 210 kJ/mol for a stress\u2013relaxation process [33]. Several scholars tried to add elements to the model to best fit the stress\u2013relaxation data [34,35]. Vaidyanathan performed the time\u2013temperature superposition principle to predict long-term stress\u2013relaxation behavior from the short-term data [36].\nThe PMMA/graphene composites are a promising candidate in electronic, optoelectrical, and environmental applications. Understanding the mechanical degradation of PMMA-based materials is of practical importance in improving the reliability and lifespan of the associated structures and systems. In this study, we investigate the effects of functionalized graphene (FG) and UV irradiation on the stress relaxation of PMMA. Raman spectroscopy and intrinsic viscosity measurements are conducted to examine the FGs\u2019 roles in the strength measurement and the UV photodegradation mechanism. Uniaxial tensile and stress\u2013relaxation tests are employed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the PMMA/FGs composites. The Kelvin representation of SLSM is used to interpret the stress\u2013relaxation data."

Figure 2 shows the curves of stress versus strain for the PMMA/FGs composites with FGs of different concentrations irradiated with a UV dose of 11.3 J/cm2 where the fracture stress, Young\u2019s modulus, and elongation at the break are tabulated in Table 1. The fracture stress, Young\u2019s modulus, and elongation at the break increase with the increase of FGs concentration but decrease with the increase of UV dose at a fixed FGs concentration. Note that the values of fracture stress, Young\u2019s modulus, and elongation at the break of pure PMMA are in the same order as those reported by Ali et al. [5]. Young\u2019s modulus is increased by 14.6% for the PMMA/FGs composite of 0.7 wt% FGs concentration, which is less than a 33% increase for the PMMA/FGs composite of 0.01 wt% FGs concentration reported by Ramanathan et al. [19]. Ramanathan et al. used the solution-mixing method to obtain the specimen. They obtained a 5% increase in stiffness using Voigt\u2019s upper bound calculation [19]. FGs have an affinity for PMMA. Adding carboxylic groups to FGs makes FGs chemically stable and provides a large specific surface area to effectively disperse the PMMA, as well as prevent agglomeration. According to Table 1, FGs enhance the mechanical strength of PMMA due to FGs hindering the chain motion of PMMA [37]. However, UV irradiation makes chain scission of PMMA and reduction in molecular weight, which leads to a decrease in the fracture stress, Young\u2019s modulus, and elongation. Such a result can be explained by Raman spectroscopy. Polymers 2022, 14, 4192 6 of 14\nFigure 2. The stress\u2013strain curves of PMMA/FGs composites with different UV doses: (a) 0 J/cm2, (b) 11.3 J/cm2, and (c) 22.6 J/cm2.\nFigure 2. The stress\u2013strain curves of PMMA/FGs composites with different UV doses: (a) 0 J/cm2, (b) 11.3 J/c 2, and (c) 2.6 J/cm2.\nThe Raman spectroscopy of the FG sheets was illustrated in Figure 3a. Two peaks located at 1326 cm\u22121 and 1569 cm\u22121 represent the D band and G band, respectively. D band is a disordered structure, induced by defects and unstable sp3 hybridization orbital C-C bond. G band is the stable sp2 C-C bond in the graphitic structure [38,39]. The Raman spectra of PMMA/FGs composite irradiated with UV doses of \u03c6 = 0, 11.3, and 22.6 J/cm2 are illustrated in Figure 3b\u2013d, respectively. Two peaks are indicated by the hollow circle in Figure 3b\u2013d which correspond to the positions of the D band and G band of the FGs. The ratio of the peak intensities of the D band to the G band, ID/IG, which is known as the defect degree, is used to investigate the chemical bonds of PMMA/FGs composites. The values of ID/IG of FGs sheets and composites with different FGs concentrations are tabulated in Table 2. The ID/IG values of composites are significantly larger than that of FGs. The strong interaction between the PMMA matrix and FGs increases the ID/IG values because the FGs structure is modified by the AIBN and leads to a good dispersion in the matrix. The higher the concentration of FGs in the PMMA/FGs composite, the higher the ID/IG value is. The strong interaction is important for graphene filler, graphene sheet dispersion, and matrix adhesion, which enhances the mechanical properties of the composites. Another piece of evidence for the uniform distribution of the FGs in PMMA/FGs composite is the low value of the standard deviation of the mechanical properties tabulated in Table 1. The Raman spectra of pure PMMA with different UV doses are shown in Figure S2 in Supplementary Information. A new small peak marked cross is located at 1647 cm\u22121 in Figure 3c,d and Figure S2 in Supplementary Information. This peak is attributed to the unsaturated C=C bonds induced by polymer chain scission [40,41]. The values of ID/IG are observed to decrease with the increase of the UV dose. UV irradiation is capable of decreasing the defect concentration in FGs.\nThe plots of (t/t0 \u2212 1)/c versus THF concentration for PMMA/FGs composite with different concentrations of FGs and UV doses are shown in Figure S3 in Supplementary Information. Huggins [42] proposed the following equation to obtain the intrinsic viscosity [\u03b7] of solute,\n1 c\n( \u03b7\n\u03b70 \u2212 1\n) =\n1 c ( t t0 \u2212 1 ) = [\u03b7] + kH [\u03b7]2c (7)\nwhere c is the mass concentration of solute, t and t0 are the flow times of solution and solvent, \u03b7 and \u03b70 are the viscosities of solution and solvent, and kH is a constant. Applying Equation (7) to Figure S3 in Supplementary Information, we obtain the intrinsic viscosities\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4192 7 of 14\nof PMMA/FGs composites with different concentrations of FGs and UV doses, which are tabulated in Table S1. The intrinsic viscosity increases with the increasing concentration of FGs, which indicates that the movement of the PMMA polymer chains in solvent becomes more difficult with the increase of FGs concentration. With the increasing UV exposure, the intrinsic viscosity decreases because UV exposure leads to polymer chain scission and reduces chain molecular weight.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4192 7 of 14\nmatrix. The higher the concentration of FGs in the PMMA/FGs composite, the higher the ID/IG value is. The strong interaction is important for graphene filler, graphene sheet dispersion, and matrix adhesion, which enhances the mechanical properties of the composites. Another piece of evidence for the uniform distribution of the FGs in PMMA/FGs composite is the low value of the standard deviation of the mechanical properties tabulated in Table 1. The Raman spectra of pure PMMA with different UV doses are shown in Figure S2 in Supplementary Information.

This peak is attributed to the unsaturated C=C bonds induced by polymer chain scission [40,41]. The values of ID/IG are observed to decrease with the increase of the UV dose. UV irradiation is capable of decreasing the defect concentration in FGs.\nFigure 3.

The symbols o and \u00d7 represent D, G bands and extra peak induced by UV irradiation.\nMark, Houwink, and Sakurada found the intrinsic viscosity and molecular weight, M, of polymer have the foll wing relation, [43]\n[\u03b7] = KM\u03b1 (8)\nwhere K and \u03b1 are constant and dependent on the polymer-solvent system. For the PMMATHF system at 30 \u25e6C, K and \u03b1 are 1.28 \u00d7 10\u22124 dL/g and 0.690, respectively [44]. Using Equation (8) and Table S1, one obtains the molecular weights of PMMA/FGs composites of different FGs concentrations irradiated with various UV doses and lists them in Table 3. The molecular weight decreases with the increasing UV dose, implying that UV irradiation makes chain scission and lowers the molecular weight. The molecular weight increases with the increasing FGs concentration; that is, adding FGs to the PMMA causes chain crosslinks and enhances the molecular weight.\nTable 3.

Experimental data for composites without UV irradiation and with 22.62 J/cm2 doses are shown in Figures S4 and S5 in Supplementary Information, respectively, which has a similar trend to the composite irradiated with 11.3 J/cm2. The stress decreases exponentially with time and finally approaches a plateau. The higher the temperature, the sooner the plateau is reached. The steady-state stress decreases with the temperature but increases slightly with FGs concentration. Both initial stress and steadystate stress decrease with the increasing UV dose. The stress reduction results from the polymer chain scission induced by UV irradiation.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4192 9 of 14\nwhere A is the pre-exponential parameter, \u0394Hv is t enthalpy change of the deformation p ocess, R gas constant, and T absolute temper ture. Similar plots for th composites without UV irradiation and at 22.6 UV dose are shown in Figure S6a,b in Supplementary Information, respectively. The solid lines in Figure 4 and Figure S6a,b in Supplementary Information are obtained using Equation (9). The enthalpy changes of the deformation process for the PMMA/FGs composites under different UV irradiation doses are tabulated in Table 4. The negative sign of \u0394Hv indicates the deformation is an exothermal process [45]. The enthalpy changes are found to be roughly independent of the FGs concentration but d crease w th the UV dose.\nTable 4.

The solid lines in Figure 5, Figures S4 and S5 in Supplementary Information are obtained using Equation (6) with the parameters, E1k, E2k, and \u03b72k for doses 11.3, 0, and 22.6 J/cm2 being tabulated in Table 5, Tables S2 and S3 in Supplementary Information, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 5, Figures S4 and S5 in Supplementary Information that the experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. The values of E1k, E2k, and \u03b72k decrease with the increase of the temperature and increase with the increasing concentration of FGs. According to Equation (6) at the initial time, Young\u2019s modulus of PMMA/FGs composite is equal to E1k. Comparing Table 1 with Table 5, Tables S1 and S2 in Supplementary Information, Young\u2019s modulus of PMMA/FGs composite at room temperature is always greater than that at elevated temperature regardless of FGs concentration and UV irradiation.\nThe steady-state stress, \u03c3\u221e, is the residual stress in PMA/FGs composite to maintain\nthe given strain (e.g., 0.5% strain).

It is found that the data satisfies the van \u2019t Hoff equation,\n\u03c3\u221e = A exp ( \u2212\u2206Hv\nRT\n) (9)\nwhere A is the pre-exponential parameter, \u2206Hv is the enthalpy change of the deformation process, R gas constant, and T absolute temperature. Similar plots for the composites without UV irradiation and at 22.6 UV dose are shown in Figure S6a,b in Supplementary Information, respectively. The solid lines in Figure 4 and Figure S6a,b in Supplementary Information are obtained using Equation (9). The enthalpy changes of the deformation\nrocess for the PMMA/FGs composites under differen UV irradiation doses are tabulated in Table 4. The negative sign of \u2206Hv indicates the deformation is an exothermal process [45]. The enthalpy changes are found to be roughly independent of the FGs concentration but decrease with the UV dose.\nTable 4.

The fitting parameters of E1m, E2m, \u03b72m, and \u03b2s for the PMMA/FGs composites of different FGs concentrations with the UV dose of 11.3 J/cm2 are shown in Table 6. The fitting parameters of E1m, E2m, \u03b72m, and \u03b2s for the PMMA/FGs composites with UV doses of 0 and 22.6 J/cm2 are listed in Tables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Information. Comparing Tables 5 and 6, we find the values of \u03b2s and R2 are the same because both Kelvin and Maxwell representations are mathematically identical. Note that parameters of E1m, E2m, and \u03b72m can be obtained from E1k, E2k, and \u03b72k using Equations (S7) and (S8) in Supplementary Information. It is found that E1m decreases with the increasing temperature for all PMMA/FGs composites. However, the value of E2m increases with the increase of temperature, which violates the concept of materials science. When the temperature increases, the atomic thermal vibrations increase, and this will cause the changes in lattice potential\nFigure 5.

The fitting parameters of E1m, E2m, \u03b72m, and \u03b2s for the PMMA/FGs composites of different FGs concentrations with the UV dose of 11.3 J/cm2 are shown in Table 6.

It is found that E1m decreases with the increasing temperature for all PMMA/FGs composites. However, the value of E2m increases with the increase of temperature, which violates the concept of materials science. When the temperature increases, the atomic thermal vibrations increase, and this will cause the changes in lattice potential energy and curvature of the potential energy curve, so Young\u2019s modulus will also change. Although the temperature dependence of Young\u2019s modulus is very complicated, the trend of decreasing Young\u2019s modulus with the increasing temperature is well known in polymeric materials [46\u201348].\nLagakos et al. [46] and Ferry [47] showed the S curves of log E versus 1/T for an amorphous polymer where E and T are Young\u2019s modulus and temperature, respectively. They divided the S curve into three temperature regions. At low temperatures, the polymer is hard and brittle, and Young\u2019s modulus decreases slowly with increasing temperature. The second one is the glass-rubber transition region where Young\u2019s modulus decreases very rapidly by several orders of magnitude over a small temperature range. As the temperature is further increased, the polymer is in a rubber state, and Young\u2019s modulus decreases slowly with temperature. In addition to the above three regions, Aklonis and MacKnight [48] claimed the fourth temperature region, where the temperature is greater than that in the third region for a linear polymer, and Young\u2019s modulus decreases very rapidly with increasing temperature. The authors found that the plasticizer and molecular weight affect the modulus\u2013temperature curve, but the trend of modulus as a decreasing temperature function does not change. It can be seen from Table 6 that E2m increases with\nthe increasing temperature for all PMMA/FGs composites and PMMA is an amorphous polymer, implying that the Maxwell representation of SLSM is not suitable to model the stress\u2013relaxation behavior of PMMA/FGs composites. From Table 5 and Tables S2 and S3 in Supplementary Information, the plots of ln(1/\u03b72k) versus 1000/T for PMMA/FGs composites with different concentrations of FGs and UV doses are shown in Figure 6. The solid lines are obtained using the Arrhenius equation,\n1 \u03b72k = 1 \u03b70\nexp ( \u2212\nQ\u03b7 RT\n) (10)\nwhere Q\u03b7 and \u03b70 are the activation energy and pre-exponential factor of the viscous deformation, R gas constant, and T the absolute temperature. The activation energy is calculated from the slope of each curve in Figure 6 and listed in Table 7. The activation energy increases with the increase of FGs concentration but decreases with the UV dose. This implies that viscous deformation occurs most easily when the pure PMMA is irradiated with a UV dose of 22.6 J/cm2. The viscous flow occurs most difficultly in the non-irradiated PMMA/FGs composites with 0.7 wt% FGs concentration. The chain scission results in the low molecular weight of the composites. It also enhances viscous deformation, and FGs inhibit the polymeric chain motion and reduce the viscous deformation. Polymers 2022, 14, 4192 12 of 14\nFigure 6.

Conclusions The effect of UV irradiation on the stress relaxation behavior of the poly(methyl methacrylate)/functionalized graphene (PMMA/FGs) composite is investigated. The fracture stress, Young\u2019s modulus, and elongation at break increase with the increase of the FGs concentration, but they have the opposite trend to UV irradiation. The molecular weight of the PMMA/FGs composite increases with the increasing concentration of FGs but decreases with UV dose. The FGs hinder the polymer chain flow and cause the chain crosslinks so that the composite with large FGs concentration has high mechanical strength. UV irradiation makes chain scission so that the PMMA/FGs composite is irradiated with a great UV dose, which chains move easily, and has low mechanical strength. The Kelvin representation of the standard linear solid model (SLSM) is used to simulate the stress\u2013relaxation data of the PMMA/FGs composite. The reciprocal of viscosity follows the Arrhenius equation, and its activation energy increases with increasing concentration of FGs and decreasing UV dose. Although the Maxwell representation of SLSM can fit the stress\u2013relaxation data of the PMMA/FGs composite and its Young\u2019s modulus increases with the increasing temperature, which violates the concept of Young\u2019s modulus as a decreasing temperature function for amorphous polymers. Therefore, the Maxwell representation of SLSM is not suitable to simulate the PMMA/FGs composite. The steady-state stress satisfies the van \u2019t Hoff equation. The enthalpy change of the stress\u2013relaxation process has a negative value, implying that stress relaxation is an exothermal process. The enthalpy change is independent of FGs concentration and decreases with the increasing UV dose.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym14194192/s1, Figure S1: Schematic of Maxwell representation of SLSM, Figure S2: Raman spectra, Figure S3: Intrinsic viscosity, Figures S4 and S5: Stress relaxation data, Figure S6: Van \u2019t Hoff plot, Table S1: Intrinsic viscosity values, Tables S2 and S3:\nFigure 6.

The enthalpy change is independent of FGs concentration and decreases with the increasing UV dose.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym14194192/s1, Figure S1: Schematic of Maxwell representation of SLSM, Figure S2: Raman spectra, Figure S3: Intrinsic viscosity, Figures S4 and S5: Stress relaxation data, Figure S6: Van\u2019t Hoff plot, Table S1: Intrinsic viscosity values, Tables S2 and S3: The parameters of Kelvin representation for UV doses of 0 and 22.06 J/cm2, Tables S4 and S5: The parameters of Maxwell representation for UV doses of 0 and 22.06 J/cm2\nAuthor Contributions: Y.-C.J.: Verification, data curation, writing\u2014Original draft; D.C.: Formal analysis, methodology, writing\u2014reviewing and editing; M.-Y.T.: Formal analysis, data curation, Validation; H.O.: Investigation, writing\u2014reviewing and editing, project administration, methodology; S.L.: Supervision, Funding acquisition, project administration, writing\u2014reviewing and editing.
