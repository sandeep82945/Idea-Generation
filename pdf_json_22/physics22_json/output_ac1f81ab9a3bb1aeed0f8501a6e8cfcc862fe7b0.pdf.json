    "abstractText": "A novel multilayer, solar selective absorbing coating that contains lamellar-distributed nanoparticles in its cermet-absorbing sublayers has been fabricated using ion-source-assisted cathodic arc plating. The multilayer coating shows an outstanding selectivity, i.e., a high solar absorptance (0.909), yet it has a low thermal emittance (0.163). More importantly, the long-term thermal stability tests demonstrate that the lamellar-structured absorbers can remain stable, even when annealed at 500 \u25e6C for 1000 h in ambient air. The coating\u2019s enhanced selectivity and thermal stability were attributed to the formation of lamellar-distributed nanoparticles in the absorbing sublayer, which form many asymmetric Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavities. In this case, the light would be held in the Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavities and thus boost the absorptivity due to the increase in interaction time. Meanwhile, the unique distribution of the nanoparticles is also beneficial for enhancing the surface plasmon resonance absorption, and thus promoting the increase in solar selectivity. Furthermore, the excellent thermal stability is ascribed to the existence of amorphous matrices, which separate and seal the nanoparticles into honeycomb shells. In this case, the atomic diffusion in the nanoparticles would be significantly retarded as the amorphous matrices can remain stable below the crystallization temperatures, which can effectively slow down the growth and agglomeration of the nanoparticles.",

            "text": "With the skyrocketing consumption of traditional fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, we are confronted with an energy crisis as these energy resources are nonrenewable and are quickly diminishing. Meanwhile, the enormous use of fossil fuels has deteriorated the environment by polluting the air and water, creating toxic wastes, and causing global warming. One remedy for this problem is the implementation of a renewable energy policy, which has been considered as the most effective way of solving the energy crisis. Among the existing renewable energies, the thermal use of solar energy has attracted increasing attention and numerous investigations due to its advantages of unlimited availability, being clean and pollution-free, and being renewable [1]. To boost its photothermal conversion efficiency, the most effective way to utilize solar energy is to use solar selective absorbing coatings that are capable of converting sunlight into heat efficiently due to their high solar absorptance and low thermal emittance [2\u20134]. The performance of a solar selective absorbing coating directly determines the efficiency of a photothermal system. Thus, developing solar selective absorbers with simultaneous high selectivity and excellent thermal stability is crucial to the commercialization of solar thermal utilization. Cermet coatings that consist of extremely fine metal particles embedded in dielectric matrices are the most widely applied solar selective absorbers due to their tunable microstructures and spectral characteristics [5,6]. However, the fine metals particles are\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6847. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15196847 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6847 2 of 12\nnaturally prone to coarsening when working at elevated temperatures, which would inevitably induce deterioration in an optical performance [7\u20139]. Thus, the performance of cermet solar selective absorbing coatings is determined by the thermal tolerances of their nanoparticles. Hitherto, several strategies including alloying and replacing the metal nanoparticles with alternatives (i.e., nitrides, oxides, and high-entropy alloys) have been attempted to enhance the thermal stability of the nanosized metal particles. Wang et al. developed WTi-Al2O3 cermet-based absorbing coatings that doped W nanoparticles with Ti elements, resulted in an absorptance of ~93% and a low emissivity of 10.3%, even after annealing at 600 \u25e6C for 840 h in a vacuum [7]. Meanwhile, Liu et al. designed a CrAlO-based solar selective absorbing coating in which the metal nanoparticles were replaced by Cr2Al intermetallics. The multilayer coating showed a high solar absorptance of 0.924 and a thermal emittance of 0.21, as well as excellent thermal stability, with a selectivity of 0.919/0.225 even when annealed at 700 \u25e6C for 2 h in ambient air [10]. Li et al. reported a solar selective absorber that substituted metal particles with TiN, and it not only showed a high solar absorption of ~95% and low thermal emission of ~3%, but it also exhibited excellent stability over a temperature range of 100\u2013727 \u25e6C for 5 h in a vacuum [11]. Further, our previous investigations found that using transition metal nitrides as the absorbing units can result in simultaneously high selectivity and outstanding thermal stability [12]. To a certain extent, the thermal tolerance of nanoparticles can be improved by enhancing thermodynamic stability. Nevertheless, current enhancements cannot meet the requirements for high-temperature atmosphere applications [7]. It is worth noting that nanoparticles are randomly distributed in amorphous structured cermet matrices, which facilitates agglomeration at high temperatures and thus accelerates the deterioration of the cermet sublayers. However, agglomeration-induced degeneration is caused by the random distribution of nanoparticles rather than thermodynamic stability, i.e., the reported cermet-based solar selective absorbing coatings have not taken full advantage of the nanoparticles. In this work, we propose a novel strategy that can simultaneously stabilize the nanoparticles and boost selectivity by introducing lamellar-distributed nanoparticles into the absorbing sublayers using ion-source-assisted cathodic arc plating. The optical properties and microstructure of the multilayer coating have been investigated using spectrophotometers, TEM, and GI-XRD.

High purity Al70Cr30 (99.99%) and Cr (99.99%) targets were used as the source materials. The Ar/N2/O2 gas mixtures were employed to prepare the AlCrN, AlCrON, and AlCrO sublayers using the AlCr target. The pressure of the cathodic arc chamber was maintained at 3 \u00d7 10\u22121 Pa during deposition. The detailed deposition parameters are described in the previous work [13]. The thermal stability of the multilayer coating was evaluated in ambient air in a muffle furnace. For the annealing procedure, 5 pieces of the coating were set in the center of the muffle furnace and then heated to 500 \u25e6C with a heating rate of 10 \u25e6C/min. The temperature accuracy of the muffle furnace was \u00b15 \u25e6C. The thermal stability of the multilayer coating was mainly determined by the coarsening behavior of the nanoparticles and the stability of the structure in the absorbing sublayer. In the present study, the aim was to test the thermal stability of the AlCrON and AlCrN sublayers. Then, the samples were cooled down to room temperature naturally for the optical measurements after an interval of 100 h (denoted as one cycle in the present study), followed by repeating the annealing cycle.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6847 3 of 12"

Spectrally Selective Absorbing Mechanism of the Layered Multilayer Coating\nTraditionally, the main absorbing mechanism of cermet coating is related to the\nlocalized surface plasmons (LSPs), which are charge density oscillations confined to\nmetallic nanoparticles (sometimes referred to as metal clusters) and metallic\nnanostructures [18]. The resonance will occur when the wavelength of the incident light\nis identical to the natural frequency of the nanoparticles. The localized surface plasmon\nresonance would result in intense light scattering and strong surface plasmon absorption\nb nds [19]. However, the absorptivity of the cerm t-based coati g was increa ed during\nthe long-term nnealing. Thus, there must be additional absorbing mechanisms\ncontributing to the enhancement in solar absorption.\nWith the aim of understanding the spectrally selective absorbing mechanism of the\nlayered multilayer coating, FDTD simulations were employed to investigate the\ninteraction between solar light and the nanolaminates in the absorbing sublayer. Figure 6\ndepicts a cross-section of the electric field of nanoparticles with layered and random\ndistributions at a wavelength of 527 nm, corresponding to the radiation center of the solar\nspectrum and indicating th widespread hot spots among the nanoparticles. Meanwhile,\nthe electric field intensity of the nanolamin tes is much higher than the structure of the\nnanoparticles that re r ndomly distributed in the sublayer. These field loc lizations\nreveal that the surface plasmon is excited at this wavelength [15,20,21].\nMeanwhile, the calculated extinction spectra also reveal that the layered structure\nexhibits a superior light absorbing behavior than the structure wherein the nanoparticles\nare randomly distributed, as shown in Figure 7. In this case, the light would be held in the\nnanolaminates, which would strengthen the interaction intensity and time between the\nMeanwhile, the calculated extinction spectra also reveal that the layered structure exhibits superior light bsorbing behavior than the structure wherein the nanopa ticles are randomly distributed, as shown in Figure 7. In this case, the light would be held in the nanola inates, which would strengthen the interaction intensity and time between the light and the AlCrON absorber. Thus, the as-deposited and annealing coatings show excellent solar selectivity. In addition, the layered distribution of the AlN and Cr2N nanoparticles forms many Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot microcavities in the AlCrON absorbing sublayer. The formation of the Fabry\u2013 P\u00e9rot microcavities allows the absorption of the vast majority of the visible wavelengths (wavelength range: 390\u2013780 nm) due to the existence of strong field intensity, as confirmed in Figure 6. For longer, near-IR wavelengths, a part of the solar light would be scattered, in addition to a part being absorbed, and it would be held in the Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot microcavities [22].\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6847 9 of 12\nIn this case, the interaction intensity and time between the solar light and the absorbing sublayer would be remarkably enhanced, which can boost the absorption of the solar spectra.

The main absorbing mechanisms of the layered structure include localized surface plasmon resonance [19] and surface plasmonpolariton [23,24], in addition to the normal particle scattering, oscillation, nd inter-band transition. When incident light enters the layered AlCrON sublayer, the nanoparticles would absorb the shortwave light due to the inter-band transition of the electrons. Meanwhile, surface plasmon polaritons and localized surface plasmon resonance would occur at the nanoparticle/amorphous interface because of the free electron oscillation and the interface effect [19,25]. In addition, there is a partial absorption that occurs in the layered AlCrON sublayer due to the scattering and the transition of the band, as well as to the v b ations of the nanoparticles [26].

            "text": "Based upon the above microstructure characterization, the formation of the nanocrystal/amorphous composite structure in the multilayer coating is considered to be the main reason for the excellent selectivity stability during long-term annealing at high temperatures in ambient air. Thus, the improved thermal stability of the AlCrON-based cermet solar selective absorbing coating was associated with an effective delay of the atomic diffusion and agglomeration. According to our previous investigation, the annealing temperature of the amorphous matrices is lower than the crystallization temperature [27]. In this case, the amorphous matrices would remain stable during long-term annealing. In other words, the nanocrystal/amorphous structure nanolaminates can remain stable during the entire annealing treatment. As the amorphous matrices are free of grain boundaries and dislocations, the long-range diffusion of the Al and Cr atoms, as well as the inward diffusion of oxygen, can be effectively retarded. Further, the existence of the amorphous structure can alleviate the potential aggregation of nanoparticles. Furthermore, the line-scanning and mappings shown in Figure 3 demonstrate a spatially inhomogeneous element distribution where the deficit Cr areas are rich in Al, suggesting that Al atoms would preferentially diffuse out to gather on the nanoparticles\u2019 surfaces. These Al atoms are easily oxidized during air annealing to generate an alumina oxide layer. Thus, the AlN nanoparticles\u2019 surfaces are partially covered by the freshly generated thin alumina layer, which can be regarded as a passivation layer and is beneficial for raising the diffusion barrier to inhibit the atomic migration so as to prevent the further oxidation of the nanoparticles. Moreover, the formation of the thin alumina layer can further suppress the coalescence of the nanoparticles via Ostwald ripening. From the complete perspective, the growth of the nanoparticles at high-temperatures cannot be ruled out, but the presence of the nanocrystal/amorphous composite structure is beneficial for isolating the absorbing particles, and so agglomeration is reduced as marginally as possible, which results in the superior thermal stability. In conclusion, both the experimental and simulated results suggest that the introduction of lamellar-distributed nanoparticles in the cermet absorbing sublayers can enhance the thermal stability of cermet-based multilayer coatings and boost their selectivity by combining several absorbing mechanisms. This strategy is firstly proposed in the present paper, and it is identified as feasible and promising for improving the solar selectivity and thermal stability of cermet-based photothermal conversion coatings."

            "text": "In this article, a novel stabilization strategy has been proposed to simultaneously boost the thermal tolerance and the selectivity of cermet-based solar selective absorbing coatings by forming lamellar-distributed nanoparticles in the absorbing sublayers using ion-sourceassisted cathodic arc plating. The proposed coating shows a high solar absorptance of 0.924 and a low thermal emittance of 0.11, as well as an excellent spectral selectivity of 0.919/0.225 after annealing at 500 \u25e6C for 1000 h in ambient air. The unique distribution is beneficial to the absorptivity due to the formation of asymmetric Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot microcavities, which can enhance the interaction intensity and duration time between the absorbing sublayers and the sunlight, and thus boost the optical performance. To summarize, introducing lamellar-distributed nanoparticles into cermet sublayers can enhance solar selectivity and significantly boost thermal stability at high temperatures in ambient air, which is of great importance to the design of solar selective absorbing coatings for high-temperature photothermal conversion.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6847 11 of 12\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.W. and K.L.; methodology, X.W.; software, Y.K. and X.Y.; validation, X.W. and K.L.; formal analysis, X.W. and D.G.; investigation, X.W.; resources, K.L.; data curation, X.W.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, X.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, K.L.; supervision, K.L.; project administration, K.L.; funding acquisition, X.W. and K.L.
