The unique crystal structure of the new compound was established by powder X-ray diffraction. The [Cu2(EDPB)\u2022H2O]n system shows catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in a Henry reaction of p-nitrobenzaldehyde with nitromethane.",

            "text": "For the last thirty years, investigations related to metal\u2013organic coordination polymers (MOCPs) of different dimensionality (one- (1D), two- (2D) and three- (3D) dimensional networks), composed of metal ions bridged by polytopic organic ligands (linkers), have been extremely popular [1]. The reason for this relates to the unusual physico-chemical properties of these highly ordered crystalline materials, which are common in some aspects, and differ in relation to their topology or architecture. One-dimensional MOCPs are linear polymers, which crystallize as chains [2]. Two-dimensional MOCPs exist mostly as layers. Three-dimensional MOCPs, or metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), are extensively studied, due to their extremely high porosity and specific surface area, which provide their potential as multifunctional materials with diverse applications [3]. Despite their structural simplicity, compared to MOFs, 1D MOCPs are also attractive objects for investigation, because they can serve as models for investigation of the correlations between synthesis variables and formed MOCP dimensionality [4,5], and thereby for developing a strategy for the preparation of coordination compounds of desirable dimensionality [6]. Another correlation, which can be studied using 1D MOCPs as models, is the relationship between MOCP dimensionality and its functional properties [7\u20139]: for instance, 1D and 2D MOCPs are rather promising as components of heterogeneous catalysts, because their architectures provide accessibility to the active sites of the substrates [10,11]. It is well known that 1D, 2D and 3D MOCPs can be obtained from the same organic (linkers) and inorganic (metal ions) building blocks, by spatially changing the synthesis variables. Understanding the possibility of self-assembly of the specific coordination network\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8376. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27238376 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8376 2 of 10\nin a predictable way is important for the functional material design. For the construction of MOCPs of different dimensionality, including 1D networks, the most popular organic building blocks are arenedicarboxylic [12,13] and diarylacetylenedicarboxylic [14,15] acid derivatives in combination with transition metal ions (Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Fe2+, etc.): the chiral derivatives of these acids have particular potential, because they pave the way to the enanthioselective functional materials including 1D MOCPs with specific properties [13,16]. We have previously reported the synthesis of diarylacetylenedicarboxylic acid [3,3\u2032- ethyne-1,2-diylbis[6-(L-prolylamino)benzoic acid, (EDPBA) (1)], which can form the homochiral Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Framework ZIOC-1 by self-assembly [17]. The ZIOC-1 material was studied as an enantioselective heterogeneous catalyst with Lewis basicity in the aldol reaction and Michael condensation. In this context, the next step of our investigations was to study the possibility of dicarboxylic acid 1 utilization as an organic linker for the self-assembly of the chiral MOCPs with Lewis active sites for enantioselective catalytic reactions involving the C\u2013C bond formation. Herein, we present the results of our study to determine the possibility of synthesizing MOCPs based on building block 1. It was found that the reaction of EDPBA (1) with Cu(OAc)2\u2022H2O smoothly proceeded in diluted aqueous ammonia at 80 \u25e6C, affording the novel 1D MOCP with formula [Cu2(EDPB)\u2022H2O]n, where H4EDPB=EDPBA, along with NH3 removal from the reaction medium. The crystal structure of this novel 1D MOCP was established by the powder XRD analysis, its thermal stability was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and its morphology was determined by FE-SEM measurements. It is well known that a number of Cu(II) complexes are effective as homogeneous [18\u201320] or heterogeneous catalysts [21] in Henry reactions (nitroaldol condensation). We intended to check the assumption that the [Cu2(EDPB)\u2022H2O]n material would operate as a catalyst in this process, due to Lewis base sites in amide moiety and Lewis acid sites as Cu2+ ions. These bifunctional properties were observed by Pombeiro et al. [22] for Zn, Cd and Co MOCPs of different dimensionality; therefore, an evaluation of the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity of the novel chiral 1D MOCP was carried out on the enantioselective Henry reaction between p-nitrobenzaldehyde and nitromethane."

            "text": "Nitroaldol condensation is one of the main important processes in organic synthesis, as a rather simple route for C\u2013C bond formation. The homochiral nature of a new coordination polymer motivated us to explore it as the catalyst in an enantioselective Henry reaction between chiral p-nitrobenzaldehyde and nitromethane in a propanol-2 medium. The catalysis mechanism suggested for the Henry reaction involved the coordination of benzaldehyde and Cu(II) center, which is an initial step for the C\u2013C bond coupling reaction between carbonyl compounds and nitroalkanes [26]. In this test reaction, the [Cu2(EDPB)\u2022H2O]n material did not show high activity. The scalemic (non-racemic) product ((4-nitrophenyl)-2-nitroethanol) was isolated with the yield ~15%, after keeping the reaction mixture for 48 h at 50 \u25e6C: this low activity was probably attributable to the low acidity of Lewis Cu(II) active sites; a high coordination number (5) participated in the coordination, with two oxygen atoms of carboxylic groups, two nitrogen atoms of amide, and amino groups and a water molecule; therefore, there were almost no vacant sites for the substrate coordination. It is noteworthy that the 3D MOCP (MOF) material with Cu2+-ions studied by us, i.e., the HKUST-1 material based on benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate linkers [21], showed almost no activity in the Henry reaction. The lower activity of the porous HKUST-1 material in this process, as compared to the [Cu2(EDPB)\u2022H2O]n polymer, could also be explained by the rather high coordination number of the Cu(II) center, and the missing Lewis sites that naturally disliked the 1D counterpart additional-amide Lewis basic sites. The enantiomeric excess of the reaction product was ~26% ee. The comparison of values of the retention times of the components of the mixture, measured by HPLC in related conditions [27], allowed us to assign (1S)- absolute configuration for a main enantiomer (see Figure S7). Similarly low enantioselectivity of the 2D MOCPs with Zn2+, Cd2+ and Co2+ ions in the Henry reaction was observed in [11]; it is probable that effective enantioselective\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8376 6 of 10\nrecognition may only be provided by 3D MOCP material (MOF) with pores containing appropriate functional chiral groups.
