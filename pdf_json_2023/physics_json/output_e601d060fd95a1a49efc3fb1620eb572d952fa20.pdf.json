            "text": "The epigenetic reader SntB was identified as an important transcriptional regulator of 25 growth, development, and secondary metabolite synthesis in Aspergillus flavus. 26 However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this study, sntB gene 27 deletion (\u0394sntB), complementary (Com-sntB), and HA tag fused to snt2 (snt2-HA) 28 strains were constructed by using the homologous recombination method, respectively. 29 Our results revealed that deletion of sntB inhibited the processes of mycelia growth, 30 conidial production, sclerotia formation, aflatoxin synthesis, and ability to colonize 31 host compared to wild type (WT), and the defective phenotype of knockout strain 32 \u0394sntB can be restored by its complementary strain Com-sntB. Chromatin 33 immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of sntB-HA and WT and RNA 34 sequencing (RNA-seq) of \u0394sntB and WT strains revealed that SntB played key roles 35 in oxidative stress response of A. flavus. The function of catC (encode a catalase) 36 gene was further analyzed based on the integration results of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. 37 In \u2206sntB strain, the relative expression level of catC was significantly higher than in 38 WT strain, while a secretory lipase encoding gene (G4B84_008359) was 39 down-regulated. Under the stress of oxidant menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), the 40 deletion of sntB obvious down-regulated the expression level of catC. After deletion 41 of catC gene, the mycelia growth, conidial production, and sclerotia formation were 42 inhibited, while aflatoxin synthesis was increased compared to the WT strain. Results 43 also showed that the inhibition rate of MSB to \u0394catC strain was significantly lower 44 than that of WT group and AFB1 yield of the \u0394catC strain was significantly decreased 45\nthan that of WT strain under the stress of MSB. Our study revealed the potential 46 machinery that SntB regulated fungal morphogenesis, mycotoxin anabolism, and 47 fungal virulence through the axle of from SntB to fungal virulence and mycotoxin 48 bio-synthesis, i.e. H3K36me3 modification-SntB-Peroxisomes-Lipid 49 hydrolysis-fungal virulence and mycotoxin bio-synthesis. The results of the study 50 shad light into the SntB mediated epigenetic regulation pathway of fungal mycotoxin 51 anabolism and virulence, which provided potential strategy for control the 52 contamination of A. flavus and its aflatoxins. 53\n54 Key words 55 Aspergillus flavus, SntB, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, CatC, oxidative response 56\n57\n58\n1. Introduction 59 Aspergillus flavus is one of the common asexual species, a saprophytic fungus and the 60 second largest pathogenic fungus after Aspergillus fumigatus, widely distributed in 61\nsoil, air, water, plants, and agricultural products in nature [1] . Aflatoxins produced by A. 62 flavus has strong toxicity, and is extremely harmful to human society. Animal and 63 human health can be negatively affected by aflatoxins, which are carcinogenic, 64\nteratogenic, and mutagenic [2] . Among aflatoxins, AFB1 is the most frequently 65 occurring and the most toxic and carcinogenic, which is converted to AFB1-8 and 66 9-epoxide in the liver and formed adducts with the guanine base of DNA and thus 67\nresults in acute and chronic diseases in both human and household animals [3] . 68 According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 25% of 69\nthe food crops in the world are contaminated with aflatoxins [4] , which are often 70\ndetected in grains, nuts, and spices [5, 6] . It is urgent to control the contamination of A. 71 flavus and its main mycotoxin, AFB1. 72 In recent decades, the biosynthetic pathway of aflatoxins was investigated in detail 73\nbenefit from the sequence of A. flavus genome [7] . This pathway consists of a complex 74\nset of enzymatic reactions [8-11] . In general, these enzymes are encoded by clusters of 75\ngenes, which are regulated by cluster-specific genes: aflR and aflS [12, 13] . The initial 76 stage of aflatoxins biosynthesis is catalyzed by polyketide synthase (PKSA) to form 77\nthe polyketone backbone [14] . Aflatoxins synthesis also regulated by environmental 78 stimuli including pH, light, nutrient sources, and oxidative stress response, which may 79\nresult in the modulation of the expression of genes involved in toxin production [15-17] . 80\nBesides the biosynthetic pathway and its internal gene regulation, protein 81 post-translational modifications (PTMs), an important mean of epigenetics, represent 82 an important role in the regulation of aflatoxins synthesis, including 83\n2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, succinylation, acetylation, and methylation [18-24] , in which 84 Snt2 (also called sntB, an epigenetic reader) is deeply involved. Despite 85 advancements in the field, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of 86 aflatoxin production in A. flavus is still fragmentary. 87 The epigenetic reader encoded by sntB in A. nidulans was identified as a 88 transcriptional regulator of the sterigmatocystin biosynthetic gene cluster and 89\ndeletion of sntB gene in A. flavus results in loss of aflatoxin production [25] , increasing 90 global levels of H3K9K14 acetylation and impairing several developmental processes 91 [20] . The homolog gene in yeast, SNT2 coordinates the transcriptional response to 92\nhydrogen peroxide stress [26, 27] . In Penicillium expansum, SntB regulated the 93\ndevelopment, patulin and citrinin production, and virulence on apples [28] . In A. 94 nidulans, SntB combined with a H3K4 histone demethylase KdmB, a cohesin 95 acetyltransferase (EcoA), and a histone deacetylase (RpdA) to form a chromatin 96 binding complex and bound to regulatory genes and coordinated fungal development 97\nwith mycotoxin synthesis [29] . sntB also regulated the virulence in Fusarium 98\noxysporum, and respiration in F. oxysporum and Neurospora crassa [30, 31] . 99\nHowever, the specific regulatory mechanism of sntB in A. flavus remains unclear. In 100 this study, we identified the regulatory network of sntB by Chromatin 101\nimmunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which 102 shed light on its impact on fungal biology. 103 Experimental Procedures 104 A. flavus strains, media, and culture conditions 105 A. flavus \u0394ku70 \u0394pyrG was used as a host strain for genetic manipulations.

All experiments were technically 111 repeated three times and biologically repeated three times. 112"

The details of experiment were according to our previous study [35] . Hyphal 127\nseptum was stained according to the descripted method [36] . Each fungal strain was 128 evaluated on four plates, and each experiment was repeated three times. 129 Fungal colonization on crop kernels 130\nAccording to our previous experimental protocol [35] , the colonizing ability of WT, 131 \u0394sntB, and Com-sntB fungal strains on peanut and corn kernels was analyzed. The 132 crop kernels were disinfected with 0.05% sodium hypochlorite and soaked for 30 min 133 in a solution containing 10 5 conidia/mL fungal spores. Afterwards, the seeds were 134 placed in a petri dish and cultured at 29\u00b0C for 6 d. Finally, the number of conidia was 135 calculated and AFB1 product was analyzed by TLC. 136 Animal invasion assay 137\nThe animal invasion assay using silkworms was according to previous study [32, 37] . 138 Silkworms (Bombyx mori) were randomly separated into four groups (10 larvae/group) 139\nwhen silkworm larva reaches about 1 g in weight. Each silkworm was injected with 5 140 \u00b5L saline, or 5 \u00b5L conidial suspension (10 6 spores/mL) from WT, \u0394sntB, and 141 Com-sntB strains. The survival rate of silkworms was calculated. Dead silkworms 142 were transferred into fresh 9 cm Petri dishes and inoculated for 5 d in the dark. The 143 conidia number and AFB1 production from each group were measured. 144 RNA-seq analysis 145 To reveal the potential complex regulatory network of the sntB, RNA-seq analysis 146 was carried out on the WT and \u0394sntB strains. RNA-seq analysis was carried out by 147\nAPPLIED PROTEIN TECHNOLOY, Shanghai (www. aptbiotech.com) [38] . Data 148\nprocessing was according pervious study [39] . Differentially expressed gene (DEGs) 149 were assigned as genes with |log2FoldChange|>1 and adjusted P-adj< 0.05. Gene 150 Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways 151 were used to analyze the functions of DEGs. 152 ChIP-seq and data analysis 153 ChIP-seq analysis was carried out on the WT and sntB-HA strains. The conidia 154 (10 4 /ml) for each strain were inoculated in 100 mL PDB shaking at 180 rpm under 155 29\u00b0C for 72h, and subjected to ChIP -seq analysis by Wuhan IGENEBOOK 156 Biotechnology Co.,Ltd (http://www.igenebook.com). ChIP experiment was according 157\nprevious study [32] . Raw sequencing with low-quality reads discarded and reads 158 contaminated with adaptor sequences trimmed were filtered by Trimmomatic (v0.36) 159 [40] . The clean reads were mapped to the reference genome of A. flavus by 160\nBurrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA, version 0.7.15) [41] . MACS2 (v2.1.1) and 161\nBedtools (v2.25.0) were used for peak calling and peak annotation, respectively. 162 Differential binding peaks were identified by Fisher\u2019s test with q value <0.05. Genes 163 less than 2000 bp away were associated to the corresponding peak. GO and KEGG 164\nenrichment analyses of annotated genes were implemented in EasyGO [42] and 165\nKOBAS (v2.1.1) [43] , with a corrected P-value cutoff of 0.05. 166 Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis 167 The fungal spores (10 6 /mL) were cultured in PDB medium for 48 h, and then 168 mycelium was ground into powder with liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was prepared by 169 TRIpure total RNA Extraction Reagent (Bestek, China) according to the protocol used 170\nby Zhang [44] . qRT-PCR was performed according to previously described [45] , and the 171 primers were shown in Table 3. 172\nsclR-F CAATGAGCCTATGGGAGTGG sclR-R ATCTTCGCCCGAGTGGTT aflC-F GTGGTGGTTGCCAATGCG\nToxin synthesis structure genes\naflC-R CTGAAACAGTAGGACGGGAGC aflP-F CGATGTCTATCTTCTCCGATCTAT\nTC\naflP-R TCTCAGTCTCCAGTCTATTATCTA\nCC\naflO-F CTTTCGGCAGTGACCTAACC aflO-R TCTTGAACTATAAGGCGACCA aflR-F AAAGCACCCTGTCTTCCCTAAC\nToxin synthesis regulatory genes\naflR-R GAAGAGGTGGGTCAGTGTTTGT\nAG\naflS-F GCTCAGACTGACCGCCGCTC aflS-R GCTCAGACTGACCGCCGCTC 18S rRNA-F CTGAAGACTAACTACTGCGAAA\nGC\nRNA extraction quality testing 18S rRNA-R GAGCGGGTCATCATAGAAACAC \u03b2-tublin-F TTGAGCCCTACAACGCCACT \u03b2-tublin-R TGGTTCAGGTCACCGTAAGAGG actin-F ACGGTGTCGTCACAAACTGG Internal reference gene actin-R CGGTTGGACTTAGGGTTGATAG\n174 Oxidative stress assays 175 To evaluate the role of sntB in fungal resistance to oxidative stress, a series 176 concentration (0, 0.12, 0.24, and 0.36 mM) of menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB) 177 were added to the medium. 10 6 fungal spores for each strain were inoculated on the 178 medium and cultured in dark at 37\u2103. The diameters of colonies were measured 3 d 179\nafter inoculation and the inhibition rate was calculated as previously descripted [33] . 180\nThe AFB1 product was analyzed by TLC after the strains were cultured in YES 181 medium in dark at 29\u2103 for 7 d. 182 Statistical analysis 183 All data in this study were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The statistical 184 analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism8 (GraphPad Software, La 185 Jolla, CA, USA). The difference was considered to be statistically significant when 186 P<0.05. 187 Results 188 The phenotype of SntB in A. flavus 189 The role of SntB in A. flavus has been previously characterized by analyzing both 190\n\u0394sntB and overexpression sntB genetic mutants [20] . To further investigate the intrinsic 191 mechanism of this regulator on the development and aflatoxin biosynthesis in A. 192 flavus, the sntB deletion strain (\u2206sntB) and the complementary strain (Com-sntB) 193 were constructed by the method of homologous recombination and verified by 194 diagnostic PCR and southern blotting (Figure S1). The expression levels of sntB in 195 WT, \u2206sntB, and Com-sntB strains was further detected by qRT-PCR and the result 196 showed that the expression of sntB was absent in the gene-deletion strains, and it fully 197 recovered in the Com-sntB (Figure S1), which reflected that the sntB and Com-sntB 198 had been constructed, and could be used in the subsequent experiments of this study. 199 The phenotype analysis of this study revealed that the deletion of sntB gene 200 significantly inhibited the growth of mycelium, hyphae morphology, the length of 201 fungal cell (between two adjacent septa), the number of conidiation, sclerotium 202\nformation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis, while the above phenotypes of both 203 development and mycotoxin bio-synthesis were fully recovered in the Com-sntB 204 strain (Figure 1). To reveal the signaling pathways of sntB in conidiation, sclerotium 205 formation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis, qRT-PCR analysis was performed to assess the 206 expression levels of sporulation related transcriptional factor genes, steA, WetA, fluG, 207 and veA, sclerotia formation related transcriptional factor genes, nsdC, nsdD, and sclR 208 [46, 47] , and the AFs synthesis gene cluster structural genes aflC, aflR, and aflP, and the 209 main regulatory gene aflR and aflS. As shown in Figure S2, the relative expression 210 levels of these genes were significantly lower in the \u0394sntB strain compared to that of 211 the WT strain, and recovered in the Com-sntB strain. These results indicated that SntB 212 regulates the conidiation, sclerotium formation, and aflatoxin biosynthesis by the 213 canonical signaling pathways mediated by these regulators. 214\nC in dark for 4 d.

Compared with 229 WT, the conidiation yield of \u0394sntB on the infected host was significantly reduced 230 (P<0.001) and no AFB1 could be detected on the hosts infected by \u0394sntB, while in the 231 Com-sntB strain, the capacity to produce conidia and AFB1 on both crop kernels 232 recovered (Figure 2A-2C and Figure S3A). The role of sntB in fungal virulence to 233 animals was also investigated. As Figure 2D-2E shown, the survival rate of silkworms 234 injected by spores of \u0394sntB strain was significantly higher than that from WT infected 235 larvae. There were less fungal mycelium, conidia, and AFB1 production on the dead 236 silkworms injected by \u0394sntB compared to the silkworms from the WT injection 237 groups, but when the gene was reintroduced (i.e. the Com-sntB group), similar to 238 what found in the WT group, the survival rate of silkworms obviously dropped and 239 more fungal mycelium, conidia, and AFB1 produced on the dead silkworms (Figure 240\n2F-2H). All the above results revealed that SntB plays an essential role in virulence of 241 A. flavus. 242 The capacity of fungal infection is closely related to secreted hydrolases, such as 243 amylase, lipase, protease, etc. In order to explore the effect of SntB on the activity of 244 hydrolases, the activities of amylase in the above each fungal strain were further 245 determined. The results showed that the colonies of \u0394sntB produced almost no 246 degradation transparent circle after adding iodine solution compared with that of WT 247 and Com-sntB, which indicated that the activity of \u03b1-amylase in \u0394sntB strain was 248 significantly reduced (P<0.001) (Figure S3B and S3C). This suggests that SntB plays 249 an important role in the fungal pathogenicity by changing the hydrolases activity of A. 250 flavus. 251\nby the above fungal strains.

In the 266 assay, the bases score Q30 was more than 93.19% (Table S1) and mapping ratio was 267 from 95.17% to 95.80% (Table S2). To further confirm the quality of RNA-Seq, PCA 268 (Principal Components Analysis) and Pearson correlation analysis were performed. 269 Correlation analysis revealed that the samples were clustered by groups (Figure 3A). 270 A plot of PC1 (47.70%) and PC2 (23.20%) scores showed a clear separation between 271 the groups (Figure 3B). A total of 1,446 and 1,034 genes were significantly up- and 272 down-regulated, respectively, in the \u2206sntB compared to the WT strain (Figure 3C and 273 Supplementary Table S3). GO enrichment analysis identified 93 enriched GO terms 274 (P<0.05) (Figure 3D and Supplementary Tables S4). In the biological process 275 category, the most enriched terms were \u201coxidation-reduction process (GO: 0055114)\u201d. 276 In the molecular function category, \u201ccatalytic activity (GO: 0003824),\u201d 277 \u201coxidoreductase activity (GO: 0016491),\u201d and \u201ccofactor binding (GO: 0048037)\u201d 278 were the most significantly enriched terms. Whereas terms associated with \u201cSet3 279\ncomplex (GO: 0034967)\u201d, \u201cmitochondrial crista junction (GO: 0044284)\u201d and 280 \u201cextracellular region (GO: 0005576)\u201d were significantly enriched in the cellular 281 component category. Additionally, all the DEGs were mapped according to the KEGG 282 database, and 42 significantly enriched pathways were identified (P<0.05) 283 (Supplementary Table S5). Among them, \u201cmetabolic pathways (ko01100),\u201d \u201caflatoxin 284 biosynthesis (ko00254),\u201d and \u201cmicrobial metabolism in diverse environments 285 (ko01120)\u201d were the most significantly enriched (Figure 3E and Supplementary Table 286 S5). 287\nfungal samples, including three \u0394sntB (KOsnt2) and three WT fungal strains.

The sntB-HA strain 300 was constructed by homologous recombination through fused HA to the 3\u2019 end of 301 sntB (Figure 4A). In the ChIP-seq assay, more than 94.66% of bases score Q30 and 302 above in each sample (Table S6), and reaching 52.50% to 94.48% of mapping ratio 303 (Table S7). The principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure S4A) and heat map 304 (Figure S4B) reflected that the quality of samples was competent for subsequent 305 ChIP-seq analysis. There were 1,510 up-enriched differently accumulated peaks 306 (DAPs) in sntB-HA fungal strain compared to the WT strain, which were distributed 307 on the whole A. flavus genome (Figure 4B, and Table S8). Most of the up-enriched 308 peaks were located in the promoter (82.85%) region (Figure 4C). The genes of the 309 DAPs were further subjected to GO and KEGG analysis. The most strikingly enriched 310 GO terms in the biological process category were \u201ccell communication 311 (GO:0007154)\u201d, \u201cresponse to stimulus (GO:0050896)\u201d, and \u201cresponse to external 312\nstimulus (GO:0009605)\u201d. Whereas terms associated with \u201cDNA-binding transcription 313 factor activity (GO:0003700)\u201d, \u201cDNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA 314 polymerase II-specific (GO:0000981)\u201d, and \u201csequence-specific DNA binding 315 (GO:0043565)\u201d were the most significantly enriched molecular function category 316 (Figure 4D and Table S9). And these genes were mostly enriched in \u201cMethane 317 metabolism\u201d and \u201cMAPK signaling pathway - yeast\u201d pathways (P value <0.05) 318 (Figure 4E and Table S10). 319\ndifferently accumulated peaks related genes. (E) KEGG analyses of the differently 325 accumulated peak related genes. 326\n327 Integration of the results of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq assays 328 After the overlapping the results from both different sequence methods (ChIP-seq and 329 RNA-seq), 238 DEGs were found (Figure 5A). According to the GO annotation, these 330 DEGs were significantly enriched in 8 GO terms, including \u201ccellular response to 331 reactive oxygen species (GO:0034614)\u201d, \u201creactive oxygen species metabolic process 332 (GO:0072593)\u201d, and \u201ccellular response to oxygen-containing compound 333 (GO:1901701)\u201d (Figure 5B). It was further noted that the DEGs were significantly 334 assigned to \u201cCarbon metabolism (afv01200)\u201d, \u201cPeroxisome (afv04146)\u201d, and 335 \u201cGlyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (afv00630)\u201d KEGG pathways (Figure 5C 336 and Table S11-S12). These results revealed that SNT2 is essential for A. flavus to 337 maintain the homeostasis of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Studies had shown 338\nthat SNT2 could response to oxidative stress in yeast [27] and Magnaporthe oryzae [48] . 339 As Figure 5D and Figure 5E showed, due to the deletion of the sntB gene, \u0394sntB 340 exhibited a severe MSB sensitivity phenotype compared to that of the wild-type (WT) 341 strain, and the phenotype recovered in the complementary strain (Com-\u2206sntB). The 342 results showed that the inhibition rate of oxidant MSB to \u0394sntB would be significantly 343 enhanced with the increase of MSB concentration. These results showed that SntB 344 deeply participates in the regulation of oxidative stress pathway. As the most abundant 345\nperoxisomal enzyme, catalases catalyze decomposition of hydrogen peroxide [49] . As 346\nthe most abundant peroxisomal enzyme, catalases catalyze decomposition of 347\nhydrogen peroxide [49] . To further study the mechanism of SntB mediated oxidative 348 response of A. flavus, the catC (encode a catalase) gene was selected based on the 349 above integration results. The relative expression levels of catC in wild-type and 350 \u2206sntB strains under MSB treatment were measured. As Figure 5F shown, the 351 expression level of catC was significantly higher in \u2206sntB strain than in WT strain, it 352 suggested that to compensate the absence of sntB, catC is up-regulated to respond the 353 higher intracellular oxidative level. However, under the stress of oxidant MSB, the 354 deletion of sntB obvious suppressed the expression level of catC compared to that of 355 WT strain, which reflected that the absence of sntB significantly impaired the capacity 356 of catC to further respond to extra external oxidative stress. These results revealed 357 that SntB is deeply involved in CatC mediated oxidative response in A. flavus. 358\n359\n\u0394sntB strains with or without MSB treatment. 367\n368 CatC is important for A. flavus response to oxidative stress 369 The functions of catC gene in A. flavus were further explored by knockout of the catC 370 (Figure S5). As shown in Figure 6A-6C, the diameter of \u0394catC strain was 371 significantly smaller than that of WT, and the conidia number in the \u0394catC strain 372 decreased significantly compared to that of WT. The sclerotia production of \u0394catC 373 strain was also significantly less than that of WT strain (Figure 6D and 6E). In view of 374 Catc is involved in the oxidative response pathways of A. flavus (Figure 4), both 375 \u0394catC and WT strains were treated by a serial concentration of MSB, and the results 376 showed that the inhibition rates of MSB to \u0394catC strain was significantly lower than 377 that of WT group (Figure 6F and 6G). Catalase is a major peroxisome protein and 378 plays a critical role in removing peroxisome-generated reactive oxygen species. This 379 result echoed that deletion of sntB increased intracellular oxidative level and the 380 inhibition rate of MSB, and up-regulated the expression of catC (Figure 5D-5F). The 381 role of CatC in the bio-synthesis of AFB1 was also assessed (Figure 6H). The results 382 showed that a relatively large amount of AFB1 was produced by the \u0394catC strain 383 compared to the WT. But when under the stress of MSB, AFB1 yield of the WT strain 384 was significantly more than that of \u0394catC strain. All the above results revealed that 385 the catC plays an important role in SntB mediated regulation pathway on fungal 386 morphogenesis, oxidative stress responding and AFB1 production. 387\nC in dark for 4 d.

Due to deeply 402 involved in oxidative response of A. flavus, we wondered if SntB also takes part in the 403 regulation of the production of lipid and glycerol. As shown in Table S13, one gene 404 (G4B84_008359) in lipase activity GO term was significantly down-regulated in 405 \u0394sntB strain, which encoded a secretory lipase belonged to the virulence factors 406\nreported in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [51] . The lipase activity was assayed by 407\nexamining the ability to cleave glycerol tributyrate substrate [52] . The results showed 408 that the colony diameter of \u0394sntB strain on PDA medium with tributyrin were 409 significantly smaller than that of the control, and the colony diameters of WT and 410 Com-sntB strains on PDA medium were obviously bigger than those on 0.3% 411 tributyrin PDA medium. The relative inhibition rate of tributyrin to the colony growth 412 of \u0394sntB strains was significantly higher than that of WT and Com-sntB strain (Figure 413 S3D and S3E). Our previous study revealed that H3 lysine 36 trimethylation 414 (H3K36me3) modification on the chromatin region of the sntB is regulated by AshA 415\nand SetB [32] . H3K36me3 usually promote gene transcription [53, 54] . Our study 416 revealed the potential machinery associated with SntB mediated regulation on fungal 417\nmorphogenesis, mycotoxin anabolism and fungal virulence, which lurks the axle of 418 from SntB to fungal virulence and mycotoxin bio-synthesis through lipid catabolism 419 (i.e. H3K36me3 modification-SntB-Peroxisomes-Lipid hydrolysis-fungal virulence 420 and mycotoxin bio-synthesis). 421\npathogenicity in A. flavus.

(C) Mechanistic diagram of the 426 bio-functions of SntB in A. flavus. 427 Discussion 428\nSntB is a conserved regulator in many species, including A. nidulans [25] , 429 Saccharomyces cerevisiae [27], Schizzosaccharomyces pombe [55], Fusarium 430\noxysporum [30] , Neurospora crassa [31] , and A. flavus [20, 25] . SntB can regulate the 431 production of uncharacterized secondary metabolites, including aspergillicin A1 and 432\naspergillicin F2 [56] . MoSnt2 protein was required for regulation of 433\ninfection-associated autophagy in Magnaporthe oryzae [48] . In A. flavus, the functions 434\nof sntB gene were analyzed by both \u0394sntB and overexpression sntB genetic mutants [20] . 435 SntB deletion impaired several developmental processes, such as sclerotia formation 436 and heterokaryon compatibility, secondary metabolite synthesis, and ability to 437 colonize host seeds, which were consistent with our results (Figure 1 and 2). Unlike, a 438 complementation strain was constructed in this study which further clarified and 439 confirmed the function of sntB gene. In this study, the potential mechanism under 440 these effects were further analyzed by detection the related transcriptional factor 441 genes of sporulation (steA, WetA, fluG, and veA), sclerotia formation (nsdC, nsdD, and 442 sclR), and the AFs synthesis related genes aflC, aflD, aflO, aflP, and aflR (Figure S2). 443 In the RNA-seq data, we also found some DEGs related to AFs synthesis (aflB, aflE, 444 aflH, aflK, aflN, aflO, aflP, aflQ, aflR, aflS, aflV, and aflW) (Figure S6). And all these 445\ngenes were down-regulated, which was consistent with that the AFs production in 446 \u0394sntB was significantly decreased compared to WT and Com-sntB (Figure 1F). These 447 results inferred that SntB regulated the morphogenesis and the production of A. flavus 448 through the above canonical signal pathways. 449 For the process of A. flavus invading hosts, in view of it is a notorious pathogen for 450 plant and animal, we established both crop and insect models, especially silkworm 451 represented animal mode profoundly revealed the critical role of SntB in fungal 452 virulence (Figure 2). The results of crop kernel models showed that the number of 453 spores of \u0394sntB on kernels of both peanut and maize was dramatically lower than that 454 of strains WT and Com-sntB (Figure 2A and 2B) and almost no AFB1 was detected 455 on maize and peanut kernels inoculated with \u0394sntB, while plenty of AFB1 were 456 detected from the kernels infected by WT fungal strain, and AFB1 biosynthesis 457 capacity of Com-sntB strains recovered compared to the \u0394sntB and WT fungal strains 458\n(Figure 2C). These results were corroborated by previous study [20] . It was also found 459 in this study that the survival rate of silkworms injected by spores of \u0394sntB strain was 460 significantly higher than the silkworms injected with spores from WT and Com-sntB 461 fungal strains (Figure 2D and 2E). What\u2019s more, we also assayed the effect of SntB on 462\nthe activity amylase, which was closely related to the capacity of fungal infection [57] . 463 As shown in Figure S3C, after adding iodine solution, the \u0394sntB strain almost did not 464 produce a degradation transparent ring compared with wild-type and complementary 465 strains, indicating the amylase activity of the sntB gene knockout strain was 466 significantly decreased (P<0.001). Our results comprehensively reveal the important 467\nfunction of SntB in the growth, development, secondary metabolite synthesis, and 468 virulence of A. flavus. 469 SntB was reported as an important epigenetic reader. In A. flavus, SntB was reported 470 to regulate global histone modifications (acetylation and methylation) and interact 471\nwith EcoA and RpdA to form a conserved chromatin regulatory complex [20, 29] . Loss 472\nof sntB in Magnaporthe orzyae also led to an increase in H3 acetylation [48] . In our 473 RNA-seq data, we also found a set domain containing histone-lysine 474 N-methyltransferase (Ash1, G4B84_009862) was down-regulated in \u0394sntB strain 475 compared to WT (Table S3), which was reported to regulate mycotoxin metabolism 476\nand virulence via H3K36 methylation in A. flavus [32] . Besides, SntB is reported to be 477\na transcriptional regulator in A. nidulans [25] and Fusarium oxysporum [30] . So, we use 478 RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to study the transcriptional response of sntB in A. flavus. By 479 integration analysis the results of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq assays, we found that the 480 enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways of the DEGs were related to oxidative 481 response (Figure 5A-5C). These results reflected that Snt2 plays an important role in 482 fungal responding to oxidative stress, which is consistent with previous reports that 483\nSnt2 could response to oxidative stress in yeast [27] , Fusarium oxysporum [30] , and 484\nMagnaporthe oryzae [48] . 485 As a harmful by-product of oxidative metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) is 486\nunavoidable and essential for fungus development [58, 59] . ROS has also been shown to 487\nbe required for aflatoxin production [60-62] . Several oxidative stress-responsive 488 transcription factors have been identified as regulating aflatoxin production, including 489\nAtfB, AP-1, and VeA [61, 63-65] . Previous studies shown that Snt2 protein coordinates 490 the transcriptional response to hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative stress in the 491\nyeast [26, 27] and is involved in fungal respiration and reactive oxidative stress in 492\nFusarium oxysporum and Neurospora crassa [30, 31] . Several GO terms (\u201ccellular 493 response to reactive oxygen species\u201d, \u201creactive oxygen species metabolic process\u201d, 494 and \u201ccellular response to oxygen-containing compound\u201d) and KEGG pathways 495 (Peroxisome) were enriched by the DEGs screened out by integration of ChIP-seq and 496 RNA-seq data in this study (Figure 5). This is the first time to show that the SntB in A. 497 flavus is important in oxidative stress response, through which SntB participates the 498 regulating of aflatoxin bio-synthesis and fungal development. 499 Fungal defense against ROS is mediated by superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalases 500 (CAT), and glutathione peroxidases (GPX). The effect of MSB on cellular growth and 501\nantioxidant enzyme induction in A. flavus was previously explored [66-68] . Once in the 502\ncell, menadione may release superoxide anion [69] , which was scavenged by 503 superoxide dismutases (SOD) and transformed into hydrogen peroxide, or react with 504\nnitric oxide to form peroxynitrite [70] . This study found that after knock out sntB gene, 505 the strain growth was significantly inhibited by MSB (Figure 5F and 5G). Some genes 506 encoded superoxide dismutases and catalases were reported to associated with AF/ST 507\nsynthesis [71] , including mnSOD, sod1, sod2, catA, catB, and hyr1. In our RNA-seq 508 data, 7 related genes were screened out (Table S14), among which, bZIP transcription 509 factor Atf21 (G4B84_008675), catlase C (G4B84_009242), catlase A 510 (G4B84_010740), superoxide dismutases sod2 (G4B84_003204), peroxisomal 511\nmembrane protein PmpP24 (G4B84_001452) were up-regulated, while catlase B 512 (G4B84_008381) and superoxide dismutase sod1 (G4B84_009129) were 513 down-regulated in \u0394sntB strain, respectively. 514 Some studies reported the correlation between ROS formation, aflatoxin production, 515 and antioxidant enzyme activation. Aflatoxin B1 biosynthesis and the activity of total 516 superoxide dismutase were effectively inhibited by cinnamaldehyde, whereas the 517\nactivities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase were opposite [72] . The expression of 518 catA, cat2 and sod1, and CAT enzymatic activity were opposite correlated to AFB1 519\nbiosynthesis under AFs inhibitor piperine treatment [73] . Deletion the gene 520\nof sod (GenBank accession no: CA747446) reduced AFs production [74] , which was 521 most similar to sod2 (G4B84_003204). The mitochondria-specific sod and the 522 genes aflA, aflM, and aflP belonging to the AFs gene cluster were reported to 523\nco-regulated [75]\n. Ethanol can inhibit fungal growth and AFB1 production in A. 524 flavus and enhanced levels of anti-oxidant enzymatic genes 525 including Cat, Cat1, Cat2, CatA, and Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase gene sod1. All 526 these reports indicated that the expression of anti-oxidant enzymatic genes was 527 opposite correlated to AFB1 biosynthesis. 528 In our study, 7 genes related to oxidative response were obviously differentially 529 expressed in transcriptome data (Table S14). Among these DEGs, 5 out of 7 genes 530 were up-regulated in \u0394sntB strain. Based on the AFs production in \u0394sntB was 531 significantly decreased compared to WT and Com-sntB (Figure 1F), the most 532 up-regulated gene in \u0394sntB strain, catC (G4B84_000242), was selected for further 533\nanalysis. We found that the deletion of sntB significantly up-regulated the catC gene, 534 however, the expression of the catC gene was almost undetectable under MSB 535 treatment (Figure 5F). Results also showed that the inhibition rates of MSB to \u0394catC 536 strain was significantly lower than that of WT group and AFB1 yield of the \u0394catC 537 strain was significantly decreased than that of WT strain under the stress of MSB 538 (Figure 6F-6H). These results indicated that SntB is profoundly involved in the catC 539 mediated oxidative response. 540\nPeroxisomes are intimately associated with the metabolism of lipid droplets [76] and 541 the histone lysine methyltransferase ASH1 promotes peroxisome biogenesis, inhibits 542\nlipolysis, and further affects pathogenesis of Metarhizium robertsii [50] . Set2 histone 543 methyltransferase family in A. flavus, AshA and SetB, were found to regulate 544 mycotoxin metabolism and virulence via H3K36me3, including the chromatin region 545\nof the sntB [32] . By ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, SntB was found to essential for A. flavus 546 to maintain the homeostasis of intracellular reactive oxygen species (Figure 5A) and 547 several anti-oxidant enzymes were up-regulated in \u0394sntB strain (Table S14). In 548 addition, we also found only one down-regulated DEG (G4B84_008359) in lipase 549 activity GO term in our RNA-seq data (Table S13), which encodes a secretory lipase 550\nand belongs to the virulence factors reported in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [51] . These 551 results suggested that SntB plays a pivotal role in regulating peroxisome biogenesis to 552 promote lipolysis involving in fungal pathogenesis. 553 Overall, we explored and clarified the bio-function of the SntB and found that SntB 554 responses to oxidative stress through related oxidoreductase represented by CatC in A. 555\nflavus (Figure 7). Our study revealed the potential machinery associated with SntB 556 mediated regulation on fungal morphogenesis, mycotoxin anabolism and fungal 557 virulence, which lurks the axle of from SntB to fungal virulence and mycotoxin 558 bio-synthesis (i.e. SntB -Peroxisomes-Lipid hydrolysis-fungal virulence and 559 mycotoxin bio-synthesis). The work of this study provided a novel perspective for 560 developing new prevention and control strategies against pathogenic fungi. 561 Compliance with ethical requirements 562 This article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects. 563 Declaration of Competing Interest 564 The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal 565 relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. 566 Data Availability 567 All data needed to evaluate the conclusions are present in the paper and/or the 568 Supporting Information.
