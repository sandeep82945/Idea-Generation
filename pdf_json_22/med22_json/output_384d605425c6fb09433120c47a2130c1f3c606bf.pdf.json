    "abstractText": "We would like to thank Dr. Bhatia and associates for their comment [1] on our article \u201cImpact of intra-gastric balloon placement on the stomach wall\u201d [2]. We strongly appreciate the positive response and interest in our work and, above all, the perception of the innovative element in it. There are several queries in the letter that we would like to address. We agree with our bariatric colleagues that patients with the previous endoscopic intragastric balloon are classified as high-risk patients and require intense supervision of multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, psychologists, and dietitians [3]. We realized that the procedure may be technically more demanding and last longer. In our center, we have adopted an interval between the intragastric balloon removal and the surgery of 1\u20133 months. We have similar remarks that the longer the interval, the less technical problems with the gastric tissue. We realize that the muscle layer and the inflammatory response of the gastric wall will decrease over time. Unfortunately, in case of extended waiting time beyond 3 months, we observed a significant weight regain. For this reason, we prefer the shorter interval. Routinely, we use the same stapler size that we use for patients qualified directly for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Considering the article by Salyer et al. [4] about optimal stapler selection during LSG, and the careful balance between tissue compression, hemostasis, and mechanical integrity, sometimes, in patients prepared with intragastric balloon and increased stomach wall thickness, we change the staplers\u2019 size for higher ones. We regularly (not only after balloon insertion) suture all staple lines during LSG with 3\u20130 V-loc running suture. Primarily, we believe in its hemostatic value [5]. In balloon cases, where the size of the staples can be easily mismatched, it seems to be even more important [6]. The last observation we would like to mention is the correlation between preand postoperative weight loss. Both of these variables are directly proportional to each other. We know that the results of our work are promising and we hope there will be further research in this field.",
