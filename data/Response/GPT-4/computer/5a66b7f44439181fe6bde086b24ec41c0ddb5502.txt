Enhanced Estimation Techniques for Flared Gas Volumes Using Advanced Machine Learning: Building upon the work that utilized Bayesian learning for flaring data analytics, future research could explore the development of more advanced machine learning techniques, including deep learning models, to enhance the accuracy of flared gas volume estimations. This could involve leveraging larger datasets, integrating more diverse data sources (e.g., higher-resolution satellite imagery, real-time sensor data from oilfields), and employing state-of-the-art algorithms for pattern recognition and anomaly detection.

Automated Regulatory Compliance Monitoring Systems: Given the significance of accurate flaring volume reporting for regulatory compliance, future research could focus on developing automated systems that utilize satellite imagery and machine learning to monitor and verify flaring volumes reported by operators. These systems could provide regulatory bodies with an unbiased, efficient means of ensuring compliance with flaring regulations, potentially incorporating real-time data analysis for more dynamic monitoring and enforcement.

Optimization Models for Gas Flaring Reduction Strategies: Research could explore the creation of optimization models that help operators identify the most effective strategies for reducing gas flaring. This could involve analyzing various factors such as gas market prices, transportation and processing costs, and potential revenue from gas commodification. Models could also consider environmental impact assessments to propose solutions that not only reduce flaring but also minimize carbon footprints.

Predictive Analytics for Flaring Events and Environmental Impact: Leveraging the insights gained from the dissertation, future research could focus on developing predictive analytics models that forecast flaring events and assess their potential environmental impact. These models could help in planning and implementing preemptive measures to mitigate the adverse effects of flaring on the environment. Predictive analytics could also play a crucial role in strategic decision-making for both operators and policymakers.

Integration of Flaring Data Analytics with Renewable Energy Systems: Considering the broader context of energy transition and sustainability, future research could investigate how insights from flaring data analytics can be integrated with the deployment and management of renewable energy systems. This could involve studying the potential for using flared gas as a source of energy for onsite renewable energy production or exploring how data-driven insights into flaring activities can inform the strategic placement and operation of renewable energy installations to offset the environmental impacts of flaring.
