    "abstractText": "Lockdown measures have obvious psychological impacts, which could, in turn, increase cardiovascular risk. We assessed the association between lockdown-related factors and the worsening of cardiovascular risk, incident anxiety and depression during 12 months\u2019 follow-up. During lockdown (April\u2013May 2020), 534 subjects, aged 50\u201389 years, were included in the PSYCOV-CV study (NCT04397835) and followed for up to 12 months post-lockdown. We found that participants with symptoms of depression during lockdown were more likely to report increased cardiovascular drug treatment (Odds-Ratio (OR) = 5.08 (1.78\u201314.5), p = 0.002), decreased physical activity (OR = 1.76 (1.10\u20132.82), p = 0.019) and weight gain (OR = 1.85 (1.08\u20133.17), p = 0.024) after lockdown. Moreover, changes in sleep patterns (OR = 2.35 (1.13\u20134.88), p = 0.022) or living in a rural area during lockdown (OR = 1.70 (0.96\u20133.03, p = 0.069) were associated with higher incident depression, whereas a better relationship with one\u2019s partner during lockdown was associated with less incident depression (OR = 0.56 (0.29\u20131.08), p = 0.084). Finally, we found that continuing to work during lockdown in a role requiring in-person contact with the public (such as cashiers, nurses or physicians) was associated with more incident anxiety after lockdown (OR = 3.38 (1.12\u201310.2), p = 0.031). Interestingly, decreased consumption of alcohol during lockdown was associated with less incident anxiety (OR = 0.30 (0.10\u20130.90), p = 0.032). Our study, conducted in a representative sample of an age group at increased risk of both cardiovascular disease and severe COVID-19, increases the understanding of modifiable factors associated with the health impacts of lockdown measures.",

During this period, there was a noticeable decrease in non-COVID medical consultations, which may have had a negative impact on the management of patients with cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. Furthermore, the lockdown is likely to have had detrimental effects on psychological health [1\u20134], which could have an adverse knock-on effect on cardiovascular risk [5\u20137]. It is therefore important to better understand the consequences of lockdown on psychological health, as well as cardiovascular risk factors and disease, all of which are major public health problems [8]. We previously published [1] factors associated with the worsening of cardiovascular risk and anxiety or depression during the COVID-19 lockdown. Notably, subjects living in urban areas during lockdown and continuing to work in a role requiring contact with the public were more likely to report a deterioration\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1684. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031684 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nin cardiovascular risk factors during lockdown. Furthermore, living in a home with no outdoor area (garden, terrace or balcony), not being fully convinced by the effectiveness of COVID-related preventive measures, feeling socially isolated or having a deteriorating relationship with one\u2019s partner, during lockdown, were all associated with depression or anxiety during lockdown. To our knowledge, no study has so far reported the consequences of lockdown with a 12-month follow-up in the general population. We assessed the association between lockdown-related factors and the worsening of cardiovascular risk, incident anxiety and depression during 12-months\u2019 follow-up, in a representative general population-based cohort study of middle-aged and older adults."

During this period, \u201cthe French population was required to stay at home and the only reasons for going out were to go to work (if teleworking was impossible); to do essential food shopping; to travel for health reasons, assisting vulnerable people, family emergencies and childcare; for individual physical activity or to take out a pet (within the limit of one hour per day and within a maximum radius of one kilometre around the home). Any gathering of people who did not live in the same home was prohibited. Infringements to this new rule were penalized initially by a fine of EUR 135 (USD 160), then by a fine of EUR 1500 (USD 1760) in the event of a repeat infringement within 15 days, and in the event of more than 3 infringements within 30 days, the fine was EUR 3750 (USD 4100) and punishable by 6 months imprisonment\u201d [1]. We contacted individuals aged 50\u201389 years who had previously participated in the southwestern France (Toulouse area) MONALISA [9,10] cross-sectional population-based study on the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors between 2005\u20132008, to invite them to participate in the PSYCOV-CV cohort study. The participation rate in PSYCOV-CV was 69% (Figure 1). The MONALISA study recruited men and women aged 35\u201374, and used polling lists, available in each town hall of the survey area, to obtain a stratified random sample. Stratification was applied according to town size (rural versus urban), age and sex, in order to obtain 200 subjects in each sex and 10-year age group (35\u201344, 45\u201354, 55\u201364, 65\u201374 years). No incentive to participate (in particular no financial incentive) was offered. All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the MONALISA and PSYCOV-CV study. The MONALISA and PSYCOV-CV studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the PSYCOV-CV protocol received ethical committee approval in April 2020 (Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes (CPP), Ile de France V, France: protocol code 20.04.03.46101, date of approval 3 April 2020)."

The first interview included prospective data (i.e., relating to the lockdown period) and retrospective data concerning the last 2\u20134 weeks before lockdown. Data concerning socio-economic level, previous personal and family medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle habits, drug intake and specific lockdown related factors (such as living in a rural vs. urban environment during lockdown, number of persons living with the participant during lockdown, feelings about lockdown) were recorded. Lipid-lowering, antihypertensive and hypoglycaemic drug use was defined as the current self-reported consumption of a physician-prescribed drug for treating cholesterol, blood pressure or glucose disturbances. Educational level was assessed together with professional activity. Smoking was categorized as regular, occasional (<1 cigarette/day) and non-smoker. Daily consumption of cigarettes and cigarillos were considered for smokers. Alcohol consumption was quantified in glasses per day with a 7-day recall method of a typical week and was categorized into no current consumption, \u22651 glass/week, \u22651 glass/day. Physical activity was assessed in minutes/week for sport (such as walking, bicycling), housework (such as cleaning, tidying, do-it-yourself, gardening, etc.) and in hours/day for TV/computer/smartphone screen time. Height and weight were declared by the participant. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m2). Diet quality was recorded using a validated food frequency questionnaire (Supplementary Table S1) [11]. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were recorded using validated scales for the general population (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2): the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7: No anxiety: 0\u20134 points; Mild anxiety: 5\u20139 points; Moderate anxiety: 10\u201314 points; Severe anxiety: 15\u201321 points) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9: No depression: 0\u20134 points; Mild depression: 5\u20139 points; Moderate depression: 10\u201314 points; Moderately severe depression: 15\u201319 points; Severe depression: 20\u201327 points) [12,13]."

Then, we assessed lockdown-related factors independently and significantly associated with worsening cardiovascular risk, anxiety and depression using multivariate logistic regression (one multivariate model for each outcome of interest). Variables initially introduced into the multivariate analyses were associated with the endpoint of interest in univariate analyses with a p-value < 0.20. A stepwise selection procedure was then applied, sequentially removing variables with a p-value > 0.05 from the multivariate model, starting with the variable with the highest p-value. When the linearity hypothesis was not respected, continuous variables were transformed into ordinal variables using quartile distributions. Interactions between independent covariates were tested in the final models. None were significant. All reported p-values were two-sided and the significance threshold was <0.05.\n2.4.1.

            "text": "We found that participants with symptoms of depression during lockdown were more likely to report an increase in cardiovascular drug treatment, a decrease in physical activity and weight gain after lockdown. Furthermore, as expected, the worsening (or improvement) of cardiovascular risk factors during lockdown was associated with the worsening (or improvement) of cardiovascular risk after lockdown. For example, smoking more during lockdown was associated with higher risk of increased cardiovascular drug treatment (and decreased physical activity) after lockdown and increased physical activity (increased house working or decreased screen time) decreased the risk of increased cardiovascular drug treatment (and decreased the risk of smoking more) after lockdown. Moreover, higher alcohol consumption during lockdown was associated with a decrease in physical activity (or diet quality) and an increase in smoking after lockdown. Finally, life conditions and feelings during lockdown were also associated with the worsening of cardiovascular risk. For example, higher perceived self-risk of COVID-19 infection during lockdown (which is an indicator, amongst other things, of the compliance of the participant to public health advice, and correlated with the adoption of prevention measures, barrier\ngestures and social distancing) was associated with a lower probability of decreased physical activity (and weight gain) after lockdown. Moreover, having a lifestyle that suited the participant during lockdown was associated with less frequent weight gain after lockdown and living with >2 people (corresponding mostly to a couple with one or more children) during lockdown was associated with less reduction in diet quality after lockdown. Finally, participants who declared that having more time for themselves during lockdown (which they may have used, for example, for cooking) as a positive effect of the lockdown experienced more reduction in diet quality after lockdown, maybe because they abandoned good resolutions after lockdown (indeed, 47% of participants who declared having more time for themselves during lockdown reported increased diet quality during lockdown, compared to 39% of those that did not report having more time for themselves). To our knowledge, our study was the first to prospectively assess the association between lockdown factors (and in particular between depression during lockdown) and the worsening of cardiovascular risk with 12-months\u2019 follow-up in the general population. Nevertheless, in the 5-month follow-up web-based study of Bu et al. (conducted in a non-random sample of adults living in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic), age, gender, education, income, employment status and physical or mental health were associated with physical activity trajectories (i.e., trajectories with little change over time (62.4%) or with decreasing physical activity over time (28.6%) or with increasing physical activity over time (9%)) [14]. Moreover, Navarro-P\u00e9rez et al. [15] used an online cross-sectional questionnaire during the lockdown period and showed that there were no changes in food consumption or routine in over 65 s during lockdown. The authors suggested that this was because this age group has \u201cconsolidated habits\u201d. These results are concordant with our previously published data during lockdown (where participants < 60 years were more likely to report a reduction in diet quality during lockdown with OR = 2.17 (1.42\u20133.32), p-value < 0.001) [1]. But here we found that participants \u2265 70 years were more likely to report a reduction in diet quality after lockdown with 12-months\u2019 follow-up. Concerning depression, as expected [16,17], we found that female gender and history of anxiety were associated with a higher probability of incident depression after lockdown. Interestingly, as Caroppo et al. [18], we found that change in sleep patterns or rural home during lockdown were associated with more incident depression whereas a better relationship with one\u2019s partner during lockdown was associated with less incident depression. This last association is in line with the study of Gonz\u00e1lez-Sanguino et al. [19], that explained that spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness were key mental health consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. Moreover, Br\u00fclhart et al. [20], showed that the peak in helpline calls 6 weeks after the initial outbreak (which offer a real-time measure of mental health concerns) was driven mainly by fear (including fear of infection), loneliness and, later in the pandemic, concerns about physical health. Concerning anxiety, accordingly with the results of Saunders et al. [17], we found that participants continuing to work during lockdown in a role requiring in-person contact with the public (such as cashiers, nurses or physicians) were more likely to report incident anxiety after lockdown. Furthermore, interestingly, decreased consumption of alcohol during lockdown was associated with less incident anxiety after lockdown. Our study has several limitations that must be accounted for. First, results are based on declarative data recorded during telephone interviews. Secondly, we may have underestimated cardiovascular events (and the increase in physician-prescribed cardiovascular drugs) due to delayed medical consultations in the COVID-19 context [21]. Cut-offs used for the endpoints may also be criticized. Finally, the study might not be fully representative of the overall French population, as it was drawn from only one French area (south-western France). Despite these limitations, our study is, to our knowledge, the first one to provide a French observational prospective data on the impact on cardiovascular and mental health of the COVID-19 lockdown with 12-months\u2019 follow-up. Moreover, it is a representative study of the general population, aged 50 to 89 years, of the south-western French area. Finally, our sample size (N = 534) exhibits highly clinically and statistically relevant results\n(considering that randomization was impossible in a study on the impact of the French COVID-19 lockdown that was politically applied nationally), and we adjusted the results for the main confounders."
