Here we investigated the role of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), a proinflammatory cytokine, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in anxiety comorbidity of neuropathic pain. Methods: Neuropathic pain was induced by partial transection of the infraorbital nerve (p\u2010IONX) or partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL) in mice and evaluated by measuring nociceptive thresholds to mechanical and heat stimulation. Anxiety\u2010like behaviors were assessed by elevated plus maze, light dark box and open field tests. Aversive or anti\u2010 aversive effect was detected by conditioned place preference test. Neuronal activity was evaluated by single\u2010unit and patch clamp recordings. The contribution of mPFC pyramidal neurons to anxiety was further examined by selectively inhibiting them by optogenetics. HMGB1 expression was measured by immunohistochemistry and western blot\u2010 ting. Antagonism of HMGB1 was achieved by injecting anti\u2010HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) intracerebrally or intraperitoneally. Results: Anxiety\u2010like behaviors were presented earlier after p\u2010IONX than after PSL. HMGB1 expression was upregu\u2010 lated in the mPFC temporally in parallel to anxiety onset, rather than in other regions associated with anxiety. The upregulation of HMGB1 expression and its translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm in the mPFC occurred predominantly in neurons and were accompanied with activation of microglia and astrocytes. Infusion of anti\u2010HMGB1 mAb into the mPFC during the early and late phases after either p\u2010IONX or PSL alleviated anxiety\u2010like behaviors and aversion without changing pain sensitization, while local infusion of exogenous ds\u2010HMGB1, the proinflammatory form of HMGB1, into the mPFC induced anxiety and aversion but not pain sensitization in na\u00efve mice. In addition to revers\u2010 ing established pain sensitization and anxiety simultaneously, intraperitoneal injection of anti\u2010HMGB1 mAb reduced HMGB1 upregulation and suppressed the hyperexcitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC after p\u2010IONX. Moreover, optogenetic inhibition of mPFC pyramidal neurons alleviated anxiety in p\u2010IONX mice. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The Journal of Headache and Pain (2022) 23:102 Background Clinical studies have shown that anxiety presents in up to 50\u201360% of patients with neuropathic pain [1, 2]. Because negative affect not only deteriorates pain, but also impedes therapeutic effectiveness [3, 4], interdisciplinary treatment that includes efforts to manage comorbid mood disorders is currently recommended for neuropathic pain [5, 6]. Unfortunately, the first-line analgesics for neuropathic pain, i.e. some antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs, are only effective in some patients at the cost of various adverse effects. Notably, antidepressants cannot evidently reduce anxiety in patients with neuropathic pain [7]. Therefore, the clinical treatment of neuropathic pain with anxiety comorbidity is still challenging and a better understanding of its pathogenesis is urgently required. Spinal nerve injury has long been widely adopted to induce neuropathic pain in rodents. Although pain abnormalities manifest in somatic areas rapidly after nerve injury, anxio-depressive behaviors usually present several weeks later with significant discrepancies among studies in terms of onset time and behavioral manifestations [8, 9]. Interestingly, several recent studies reported that rodents exhibit anxiety-like behaviors as early as 2  weeks after infraorbital nerve (ION) injury [10, 11]. The early onset of anxiety comorbidity under orofacial neuropathic pain conditions implies unique pathophysiological changes in the brain. Further study on the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon will provide us with a chance to better understand the comorbid anxiety in neuropathic pain, hence is beneficial for the development of new treatment strategies. It has been noticed that inflammation is associated with various types of anxiety disorders [12, 13]. Coincidently, spinal nerve injury is frequently reported to induce neuroinflammatory reactions in multiple brain regions that are implicated in mood disorders including anxiety [14, 15], although the contribution of cerebral neuroinflammation to neuropathic pain and comorbid mood disorders has not been fully understood. By contrast, cerebral neuroinflammation after orofacial nerve injury as well as its association with comorbid mood disorders remain elusive. High mobility group box  1 (HMGB1), a member of damage-associated molecular pattern family, is released either passively from necrotic cells or actively from alive but \u201cstressed\u201d cells after being translocated into the cytoplasm from nucleus [16, 17]. As an alarmin, the extracellular HMGB1 is believed to activate innate and adaptive immunity and drives inflammatory responses via binding to multiple receptors [18, 19]. Previously, we reported that partial transection of ION (p-IONX) in mice evokes orofacial and widespread pain sensitization [20], in which HMGB1 plays crucial roles [21]. However, whether HMGB1 serves as a causative factor for comorbid mood disorders of neuropathic pain has not been studied, although it has been linked to anxiety states under other pathological conditions [22, 23]. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of cerebral HMGB1 in anxiety comorbidity in neuropathic pain. We found that early-onset anxiety was parallel to the upregulation of HMGB1 in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice after p-IONX. Local administration of monoclonal antibody against HMGB1 (anti-HMGB1 mAb) and exogenous ds-HMGB1 (the pro-inflammatory form of HMGB1) into the mPFC demonstrated the determinant role of HMGB1 in anxiety, which was supported by that optogenetic inhibition of mPFC pyramidal neurons alleviated anxiety. Moreover, the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of intraperitoneal injection of anti-HMGB1 mAb justify antagonism of HMGB1 as a promising therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain with anxiety comorbidity.",

Anxiety\u2011like behaviors were assessed by elevated plus maze, light dark box and open field tests. Aversive or anti\u2011 aversive effect was detected by conditioned place preference test. Neuronal activity was evaluated by single\u2011unit and patch clamp recordings. The contribution of mPFC pyramidal neurons to anxiety was further examined by selectively inhibiting them by optogenetics. HMGB1 expression was measured by immunohistochemistry and western blot\u2011 ting. Antagonism of HMGB1 was achieved by injecting anti\u2011HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) intracerebrally or intraperitoneally.\nResults: Anxiety\u2011like behaviors were presented earlier after p\u2011IONX than after PSL. HMGB1 expression was upregu\u2011 lated in the mPFC temporally in parallel to anxiety onset, rather than in other regions associated with anxiety. The upregulation of HMGB1 expression and its translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm in the mPFC occurred predominantly in neurons and were accompanied with activation of microglia and astrocytes. Infusion of anti\u2011HMGB1 mAb into the mPFC during the early and late phases after either p\u2011IONX or PSL alleviated anxiety\u2011like behaviors and aversion without changing pain sensitization, while local infusion of exogenous ds\u2011HMGB1, the proinflammatory form of HMGB1, into the mPFC induced anxiety and aversion but not pain sensitization in na\u00efve mice. In addition to revers\u2011 ing established pain sensitization and anxiety simultaneously, intraperitoneal injection of anti\u2011HMGB1 mAb reduced HMGB1 upregulation and suppressed the hyperexcitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC after p\u2011IONX. Moreover, optogenetic inhibition of mPFC pyramidal neurons alleviated anxiety in p\u2011IONX mice.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Clinical studies have shown that anxiety presents in up to 50\u201360% of patients with neuropathic pain [1, 2]. Because negative affect not only deteriorates pain, but also impedes therapeutic effectiveness [3, 4], interdisciplinary treatment that includes efforts to manage comorbid mood disorders is currently recommended for neuropathic pain [5, 6]. Unfortunately, the first-line analgesics for neuropathic pain, i.e. some antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs, are only effective in some patients at the cost of various adverse effects. Notably, antidepressants cannot evidently reduce anxiety in patients with neuropathic pain [7]. Therefore, the clinical treatment of neuropathic pain with anxiety comorbidity is still challenging and a better understanding of its pathogenesis is urgently required.\nSpinal nerve injury has long been widely adopted to induce neuropathic pain in rodents. Although pain abnormalities manifest in somatic areas rapidly after nerve injury, anxio-depressive behaviors usually present several weeks later with significant discrepancies among studies in terms of onset time and behavioral manifestations [8, 9]. Interestingly, several recent studies reported that rodents exhibit anxiety-like behaviors as early as 2\u00a0 weeks after infraorbital nerve (ION) injury [10, 11]. The early onset of anxiety comorbidity under orofacial neuropathic pain conditions implies unique pathophysiological changes in the brain. Further study on the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon will provide us with a chance to better understand the comorbid anxiety in neuropathic pain, hence is beneficial for the development of new treatment strategies.\nIt has been noticed that inflammation is associated with various types of anxiety disorders [12, 13]. Coincidently, spinal nerve injury is frequently reported to induce neuroinflammatory reactions in multiple brain regions that are implicated in mood disorders including anxiety [14, 15], although the contribution of cerebral neuroinflammation to neuropathic pain and comorbid mood disorders has not been fully understood. By contrast, cerebral neuroinflammation after orofacial nerve injury as well as its association with comorbid mood disorders remain elusive. High mobility group box\u00a0 1 (HMGB1), a member of damage-associated molecular pattern family, is released either passively from necrotic\ncells or actively from alive but \u201cstressed\u201d cells after being translocated into the cytoplasm from nucleus [16, 17]. As an alarmin, the extracellular HMGB1 is believed to activate innate and adaptive immunity and drives inflammatory responses via binding to multiple receptors [18, 19]. Previously, we reported that partial transection of ION (p-IONX) in mice evokes orofacial and widespread pain sensitization [20], in which HMGB1 plays crucial roles [21]. However, whether HMGB1 serves as a causative factor for comorbid mood disorders of neuropathic pain has not been studied, although it has been linked to anxiety states under other pathological conditions [22, 23].\nIn the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of cerebral HMGB1 in anxiety comorbidity in neuropathic pain. We found that early-onset anxiety was parallel to the upregulation of HMGB1 in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice after p-IONX. Local administration of monoclonal antibody against HMGB1 (anti-HMGB1 mAb) and exogenous ds-HMGB1 (the pro-inflammatory form of HMGB1) into the mPFC demonstrated the determinant role of HMGB1 in anxiety, which was supported by that optogenetic inhibition of mPFC pyramidal neurons alleviated anxiety. Moreover, the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of intraperitoneal injection of anti-HMGB1 mAb justify antagonism of HMGB1 as a promising therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain with anxiety comorbidity."

Mice were originally purchased from Jackson Laboratory and multiplied in the animal facility of Zhejiang University. They were housed in ventilated cages in a clean room with controlled humidity (45- 65%) and temperature (22\u201324\u2103) on a standard 12-h light\u2013dark cycle (lights on at 8 am).

All experiments were in accordance with guidelines of The International Association for the Study of Pain [24] and were approved by the Zhejiang University Animal Experimentation Committee. Mice were assigned into different groups randomly. Efforts were made to minimize the animal use and suffering.\nConclusion: These results demonstrate that HMGB1 in the mPFC drives and maintains anxiety comorbidity in neuropathic pain by increasing the excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, and justify antagonism of HMGB1, e.g., neutralization by mAb, as a promising therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain with anxiety comorbidity.\nKeywords: HMGB1, Neuroinflammation, mPFC, Neuropathic pain, Comorbid mood disorders, Anxiety"

Briefly, the left sciatic nerve was exposed and under the surgical microscope, an 8/0 silk suture was inserted into the dorsum of the nerve trunk with a 3/8 curved, reversed-cutting needle and was tightly ligated so that the dorsal 1/3\u20131/2 of the nerve thickness was trapped in the ligature. The sciatic nerve in the sham group was exposed but left intact. The wound was closed in layers.\nPartial infraorbital nerve transection (p\u2011IONX) The p-IONX surgery was performed as previously described [20]. In brief, under isoflurane anesthesia, the mouth of the mouse was opened by pulling the lower and upper fore teeth with a rubber thread. Under the surgical microscope, a 2\u20132.5\u00a0mm incision was made from the gingival mucosa of the first molar on the left side to expose the deep branches of the ION. Approximately 1\u00a0 mm of the nerve fibers was excised with a pair of microsurgical scissors and an absorbent gelatin sponge was placed on the wound.

The laser with a pulse width of 150\u00a0ms generated by an infrared diode laser machine (LYPE, China) was shot at the left vibrissal pad with the guidance of a red aiming beam. Evoked pain-like behaviors included scratching the vibrissal pad, shaking head or turning around the body. The laser intensity (A) was started from 15 A and incremented by 1 A. Each intensity was tested 3 times with an interval of at least 5\u00a0min. The threshold was defined as the intensity that induced pain-like behaviors at least 2 times out of 3 trails [20]. To test the pain-like behaviors evoked by stimulation of the hind paw, the mouse was placed in a plastic cylinder (height of 9\u00a0cm and diameter of 8\u00a0cm) with metal mesh bottom. Mechanical stimulation was applied to the plantar surface of the left hind paw by a set of von Frey hairs numbered 1\u20139 with bending force 0.008, 0.02, 0.03, 0.07, 0.16, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0 and 1.4\u00a0g, respectively [31]. The test was started from hair No.5 (0.16\u00a0 g) and progressed according to an up-down method. Each test constituted a constant number of five stimuli with an interval of at least 5\u00a0 min. Each stimulus lasted 2\u00a0 s. A sharp withdrawal or an immediate flinch of the hind paw indicated a positive response. The final number of von Frey hair was determined by adding 0.5 to the number of the fifth test if it evoked responses or reducing 0.5 if it did not. The paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) to mechanical stimulation was calculated by the equation: PWT force = 10(x*F+B) (F is the final number of von Frey hair, x = 0.240, B = \u2212 2.00). Noxious thermal stimulation was supplied by a laser pulse with a wave width of 200\u00a0ms that was shot at the plantar surface of the left hind paw. The laser intensity was increased by 1A step and each intensity was tried 3 times with an interval of at least 5\u00a0 min. The PWT was defined as the intensity that evoked withdrawal responses at least 2 times out of 3 trails.\nConditioned place preference (CPP) test The CPP test was performed in a standard three-box apparatus consisting of two large boxes with the same size (45 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 35 cm3) and a middle connecting channel (40 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 35 cm3). According to previous study [32], the test was divided into consecutive three phases, i.e. habituation or preconditioning, conditioning and testing. During the habituation phase for two days, the mice were placed in the apparatus for 30\u00a0 min each day and were allowed to move freely with access to all three boxes. On the second day, the movements of each animal in the first 15\u00a0 min were recorded and analyzed with ANY-maze to verify the absence of preference for each box. Animal\nspending > 80% or < 20% of the total time in any box were excluded from further testing. A four-day conditioning experiment was then performed. The mice receiving dsHMGB1 (HMGBiotech Srl, Italy), the pro-inflammatory from of HMGB1 or anti-HMBG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), the mAb against HMGB1 we developed to neutralize the secreted HMGB1 [33], were placed into the box on one side for 30\u00a0min without access to other boxes on the third and the fifth days, while those receiving vehicle were placed into the other side on the fourth and the sixth days for 30\u00a0min. On the seventh day, the mice were placed in the middle box with free access to other boxes and their movements were recorded for 15\u00a0 min. The time that the animal spent in each box and the percentage occupancy (preference) and shifts in occupancy for one side were analyzed by ANY-maze and compared with that on the second day."

            "text": "As reported [20, 21, 25, 37], MRL/MPJ mice showed decreased thresholds to mechanical and heat stimulation at the hind paw in both p-IONX and PSL groups and decreased thermal threshold at the vibrissal pad in the p-IONX group, which lasted at least 4\u00a0 weeks PO (Fig.\u00a0 1a-c). These results verified that PSL induces somatic, while p-IONX induces widespread (somatic in addition to orofacial) neuropathic pain. Moreover, mice in the p-IONX group displayed anxiety-like behaviors as early as one week after surgery, evidenced by less spent time in the open arm, the dark box and the center zone in the EPM, LDB and OFT tests, respectively. These manifestations maintained up to 4\u00a0 weeks PO, when mice in the PSL group started to show such anxiety-like behaviors (Fig.\u00a01d-h). By contrast, mice either in the p-IONX or PSL group did not show depressionlike behaviors until 4\u00a0weeks after surgery, as indicated by unchanged immobility time in the TST and FST as well as unchanged distance moved in the OFT (Fig.\u00a01i). In addition, we found that anxiety-like behaviors were observed in the LDB test in C57BL/6\u00a0 J mice 2\u00a0 weeks after p-IONX (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 1a-c), which was also earlier than reported after somatic nerve injury [8\u201310, 38]. These results together demonstrate that early onset anxiety develops under the condition of widespread pain sensitization after trigeminal nerve injury.\n(See figure on next page.)

We found that HMGB1 expression was increased in many brain regions, such as the cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus and amygdala after p-IONX (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 2). The expression in four anxietyrelated nuclei, the mPFC, BLA, vHPC and PBN was evaluated semi-quantitatively by measuring the fluorescence intensity and compared between the p-IONX and PSL group. We found that HMGB1 expression was remarkably elevated in the mPFC in the p-IONX group but not in the PSL group, whereas that in the BLA and PBN was up-regulated in both groups without differences, and\nFig. 2 HMGB1 expression in the mPFC was increased temporally in parallel to comorbid anxiety in neuropathic pain. a Schedule of experimental procedures. b Representative photomicrographs of HMGB1 immunostaining in the mPFC, BLA, vHPC and PBN.

The expression changes in the mPFC and BLA were further verified by western blotting (Fig.\u00a0 2d and e). Interestingly, when anxiety-like behaviors were exhibited on D30 PO in PSL mice, a significant upregulation of HMGB1 expression in the mPFC was also detected (Fig.\u00a0 2d). By contrast, the expression in the BLA was increased without differences between p-IONX and PSL groups (Fig.\u00a0 2e). HMGB1 upregulation in the mPFC was also observed in C57BL/6\u00a0J mice 2\u00a0weeks after p-IONX when anxiety was detected (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 1d and e). These results demonstrate that HMGB1 upregulation in the mPFC temporally parallels the onset of comorbid anxiety in neuropathic pain. HMGB1 was\u00a0released mainly by\u00a0neurons in\u00a0the\u00a0mPFC after\u00a0p\u2011IONX To identify the cellular sources of HMGB1 upregulation and release, HMGB1 was separately coimmunostained with the markers of neurons (NeuN+), microglia (Iba1+) and astrocytes (S100b+) in the mPFC. The percentages of HMGB1-positive neurons and microglia, but not astrocytes were markedly increased on D9 after p-IONX (Fig.\u00a03a-d). HMGB1 was mainly located in the nuclei in the sham group of mice, but translocated into the cytoplasm after p-IONX, which predominantly occurred in neurons (Fig.\u00a0 3a-c and e). In addition, microglia and astrocytes in the mPFC presented morphological changes indicative of activation and enhanced fluorescence intensity of Iba1 and S100b (Fig.\u00a03b, c and\u00a0\nf ). The translocation of HMGB1 was further verified by western blotting to quantify the amounts in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig.\u00a03g and h). These results demonstrate that HMGB1 upregulation and release in the mPFC after p-IONX mainly occurs in neurons and is accompanied with glial activation.\nHMGB1 upregulation in\u00a0the\u00a0mPFC drove anxiety and\u00a0aversion but\u00a0not\u00a0pain sensitization after\u00a0p\u2011IONX To investigate the function of HMGB1 upregulation after p-IONX, anti-HMGB1 mAb (2\u00a0\u03bcg) was infused into bilateral mPFC for consecutive 9\u00a0 days starting immediately after surgery (Fig.\u00a04a and b). We found that the pain thresholds in the hind paw and vibrissal pad were not different between the two groups treated with anti-HMGB1 mAb and the control IgG, respectively, either during (D3 and D7 PO) or after (D11 and D14 PO) the treatment (Fig.\u00a04c). However, this treatment alleviated anxiety-like behaviors after p-IONX on D8/9 PO (Fig.\u00a04d). The preventive anxiolytic effect outlasted the treatment period because animals receiving anti-HMGB1 mAb still spent more time in the open arms in the EPM test until D15 PO, compared with those receiving nothing or control IgG (Fig.\u00a0 4e). In addition, anti-HMGB1 mAb treatment\ninduced place preference in the CPP test carried out one week after surgery, indicating relief of aversion (Fig.\u00a0 4fj). By contrast, local injection of anti-HMGB1 mAb into bilateral BLA where HMGB1 was also upregulated after p-IONX did not affect anxiety onset and pain sensitization (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3). These results indicate that HMGB1 upregulation in the mPFC rather than that in the BLA is required for anxiety onset and aversion but not for pain sensitization in mice with widespread neuropathic pain.\nHMGB1 upregulation in\u00a0the\u00a0mPFC maintained comorbid anxiety in\u00a0neuropathic pain To investigate whether HMGB1 participates in the maintenance of comorbid anxiety in neuropathic pain, antiHMGB1 mAb (2\u00a0 \u03bcg) was infused into bilateral mPFC once daily throughout D30 to D37 after p-IONX and PSL, respectively, when anxiety had been established in both groups of mice (Fig.\u00a0 5a). We found that antiHMGB1 mAb attenuated anxiety-like behaviors in mice of both models (Fig.\u00a05b and c). These results indicate that HMGB1 in the mPFC maintains the anxiety state of mice under either widespread or somatic neuropathic pain conditions.\nHMGB1 upregulation in\u00a0the\u00a0mPFC was\u00a0sufficient to\u00a0induce anxiety and\u00a0aversion but\u00a0not\u00a0pain sensitization To further verify the contribution of mPFC HMGB1 to anxiety, ds-HMGB1 (1\u00a0 \u03bcg), the pro-inflammatory form of HMGB1, was infused into bilateral mPFC of intact mice once daily for consecutive 9\u00a0days (Fig.\u00a06a). The pain thresholds in the hind paw and vibrissal pad did not significantly change during (D3 and D7) and after (D11 and D14) the infusion (Fig.\u00a0 6b). However, ds-HMGB1 infusion induced anxiety-like behaviors, which vanished one week after the cessation of infusion (Fig.\u00a0 6c&d). In the CPP test, mice spent less time in the box paired with ds-HMGB1 treatment, demonstrating aversion was elicited (Fig.\u00a0 6e and f ). These results together indicate that HMGB1 upregulation in the mPFC is sufficient to induce anxiety and aversion, but not pain sensitization in mice."

The action of systemic antiHMGB1 mAb in the CNS was verified by the decreases in HMGB1 expression in the mPFC, BLA and medulla (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04).

The charge transfer of sEPSCs (CsEPSC) rather than that of sIPSCs (CsIPSC) was also increased, resulting in an elevation of E/I ratio (\u2223CsEPSC\u2223/CsIPSC) (Fig.\u00a0 7c-f ). In addition, although the resting potential and rheobase (the lowest current that evoked action potential firing) of these neurons were not changed (Fig.\u00a0 7g and h), more action potentials were evoked when injecting current at two-fold of rheobase and the firing rate rose more rapidly along with the increase of current intensity by steps (Fig.\u00a0 7ik). Meanwhile, in\u00a0 vivo single unit recordings revealed that the spontaneous firing of these neurons was significantly increased after p-IONX (Fig.\u00a07l and m). However, these electrophysiological changes induced by ION injury were all reversed by systemic anti-HMGB1 mAb treatment (Fig.\u00a0 7c-m). By contrast, neurons in layer 5/6 showed decreases in sEPSC frequency and E/I ratio after p-IONX, on which anti-HMGB1 mAb had no effect (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 5). These results indicate that HMGB1 upregulation in the mPFC enhances excitatory synaptic transmission and excitability of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 after p-IONX. To further verify the causative role of hyperexcitability of mPFC pyramidal neurons in anxiety after p-IONX, these neurons were selectively inhibited by optogenetic approach (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6a&b). Arch virus selectively targeting glutamatergic neurons was infused into the mPFC. We found that after optically inhibiting glutamatergic neurons by yellow light in the mPFC on D14 PO, although the mechanical and thermal pain thresholds in the hind paw were not changed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6c), anxiety was alleviated as detected by EPM and LDB tests (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 6d). These results indicate that the hyperexcitability of mPFC pyramidal neurons underlies anxiety after p-IONX.\nSystemic anti\u2011HMGB1 mAb simultaneously alleviated pain sensitization and\u00a0anxiety after\u00a0p\u2011IONX Our previous studies have shown anti-HMGB1 mAb given systemically inhibits neuropathic pain and epileptic\nseizures, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent [22, 27]. Here we further examined its effect on comorbid anxiety in neuropathic pain. Anti-HMGB1 mAb (1\u00a0 mg/ kg) was given intraperitoneally once daily for consecutive 9\u00a0days from D7 to D16 after p-IONX when anxiety was established (Fig.\u00a0 8a). Behavioral tests revealed that anti-HMGB1 mAb alleviated not only pain sensitization (Fig.\u00a08b) but also anxiety-like behaviors (Fig.\u00a08c). By contrast, gabapentin, one of the first line agents for the management of neuropathic pain, alleviated pain sensitization only at high (20\u00a0 mg/kg), but not low (10\u00a0 mg/ kg) dose (Fig.\u00a0 8b), while neither dose showed effect on comorbid anxiety (Fig.\u00a0 8c). These results indicate that systemic administration of anti-HMGB1 mAb once daily alleviates neuropathic pain and anxiety comorbidity simultaneously."

            "text": "Previously we have reported that p-IONX induces widespread, but PSL only induces somatic neuropathic pain [37]. Here we further found that anxiety-like behaviors developed earlier after p-IONX than PSL, consistent with previous reports that anxiety-like behaviors are exhibited earlier after ION injury than sciatic nerve injury [8\u201311, 38]. Clinical observations have shown that affective symptoms are positively correlated with the intensity and affected area of pain in patients [39]. Given orofacial pain, of which trigeminal pain is the most common and excruciating form, often spreads to adjacent or distant body regions [40, 41], it is very likely that the severe and widespread pain accelerates anxiety onset in mice after p-IONX. Intriguingly, no depression-like behaviors were observed up to 4\u00a0weeks in p-IONX mice. It has been reported that depressive behaviors presented at least 6\u00a0weeks after sciatic nerve injury in mice and are absent up to 45\u00a0days after trigeminal nerve injury in rats [8, 11]. These results together suggest that injuries to the orofacial and spinal nerve induce affective disorders with different characteristics and evoke anxiety more readily than depression.

Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying early onset anxiety after p-IONX potentially provokes the development of new therapeutic strategies.\nBy comparing HMGB1 expression in the brain regions related to anxiety, we found that HMGB1 upregulation in the mPFC was temporally correlated with the early and late onset anxiety after p-IONX and PSL, respectively. Taking advantage of local neutralization of HMGB1 by specific mAb, we revealed that HMGB1 in the mPFC not only drives, but also maintains anxiety-like behaviors and aversion after nerve injury. Moreover, exogenous HMGB1 locally infused into the mPFC was anxiogenic and aversive in na\u00efve animals. These results demonstrate a causal link between HMGB1 upregulation in the mPFC and negative affect after nerve injury. It is known that after translocated into the cytoplasm and then released into the extracellular space, HMGB1 promotes inflammation via binding to several inflammatory-associated receptors [18, 19]. We found that HMGB1 was mainly secreted by neurons and this process was accompanied with the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the mPFC after p-IONX. These results together indicate that the anxiety comorbidity of neuropathic pain is associated with neuroinflammation evoked by neuron-derived HMGB1 in the mPFC. On the other hand, the absence of association of HMGB1 upregulation in the BLA with\nFig. 6 HMGB1 in the mPFC was sufficient to induce anxiety\u2011like behaviors and aversion but not pain sensitization in na\u00efve mice. a Schedule of experimental procedures. b Paw withdrawal thresholds to mechanical stimulation and noxious heat stimulation at the left hind paw and head withdrawal threshold to noxious heat stimulation at the left vibrissal pad. c, d Anxiety\u2011like behaviors measured by EPM, LDB and OFT on D8/9 (c) and D15/16 (d) after administration. e Representative heat maps in the CPP test. f Time spend by mice in the saline\u2011 and ds\u2011HMGB1\u2011paired boxes. *, ** and *** indicate P < 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively, compared with the saline\u2011treated group in (c) and pre\u2011conditioning in (f), unpaired t test. n = 8/group\n(See figure on next page.)\nanxiety and pain sensitization indicates mild contribution of HMGB1 to these two phenotypes. The BLA was reported to be involved in controlling anxiety after sciatic nerve injury or local infusion of lipopolysaccharide [42, 43]. The discrepancies with the present study suggest that mechanisms underlying anxiety status with different etiologies are very likely different. Nonetheless, the contributions of HMGB1 upregulation in brain regions outside the mPFC including the BLA to other consequences of nerve injury, e.g. fear memory and cognition deficit, are worth of further investigation.\nThe dysfunction of mPFC neurons has been implicated in anxiety after various insults [44]. Here, we found that layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were hyperactive one week after p-IONX, temporally in parallel to HMGB1 upregulation and anxiety onset. Moreover, antagonizing HMGB1 reversed the hyperexcitability of these neurons and attenuated anxiety of mice concurrently, demonstrating a predominant role of HMGB1 in these electrophysiological and behavioral changes. HMGB1 is reported to increase neuronal excitability either by promoting neuroinflammation or acting in synergy with other potent inflammatory molecules [45, 46]. Therefore, we deduced that HMGB1 in the mPFC induces anxiety rather than pain sensitization by activating neurons in layer 2/3, hence anti-HMGB1 mAb is anxiolytic but not analgesic. By contrast, excitatory neurotransmission to pyramidal neurons in layer 5/6 were suppressed after p-IONX, on which HMGB1 neutralization had no effect, indicating HMGB1 does not participate in suppressing these neurons. These results also imply that different subgroups of neurons in the mPFC respond to HMGB1 in different ways. The hypoactivity of mPFC layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons after nerve injury is proposed to contribute neuropathic pain at least by impairing the efficacy of descending pain inhibitory system [47, 48]. The absence of analgesic effect of local anti-HMGB1 mAb in the mPFC may be partly explained by the unchanged neuronal excitability. Intriguingly, optogenetic inhibition of mPFC pyramidal neurons alleviated anxiety-like behaviors but not pain sensitization after p-IONX. These findings support the causative role of hyperactive mPFC glutamatergic neurons in comorbid anxiety of neuropathic pain, but are not coincident with those reporting\noptogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons results in pain modulation [49]. The discrepancy is probably due to different models used in the studies. Moreover, instant optical manipulation might be not sufficient to produce modulatory effect on neuropathic pain, as we previously reported [50].\nAlthough clinical studies have showed that negative affect deteriorates pain and prevents its recovery, the absence of interaction was often reported [42, 51, 52]. In addition, anxio-depressive behaviors appear weeks after nerve injury, and retain weeks after cure of neuropathic hypersensitivity [53, 54], indicating pain and anxiety are not necessarily concomitant. Here we found that attenuation of anxiety after local infusion of anti-HMGB1 mAb in the mPFC was not accompanied with pain alleviation in p-IONX mice and vice versa in mice treated with gabapentin. Coincidently, HMGB1 infusion in the mPFC induced anxiety and aversion but did not affect pain sensitivity in na\u00efve mice. The disassociation of pain and negative affect suggests that mechanisms underlying these two consequences of nerve injury are very likely separate but with overlapping to some extent, although they may promote each other after nerve injury. Therefore, they should be treated as independent and equally important disorders. Because of the limited efficacy of current therapies for neuropathic pain and mood disorders, identification of common therapeutic targets is of great clinical significance. Considering the fact that HMGB1 in the periphery and spinal cord contributes to pain abnormalities after nerve injury [21, 23, 55, 56]. we conclude that HMGB1 is involved in both the sensory and negative affective consequences of nerve injury by acting in different sites of the nervous system and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for both pain and comorbid anxiety.\nSupportively, we found that systemic anti-HMGB1 mAb simultaneously alleviated anxiety-like behaviors and pain sensitization in p-IONX mice while reducing HMGB1 expression in the CNS. Normally, blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) hinders the exchange of large molecules between the blood and CNS. However, its permeability can be increased evidently under a variety of pathophysiological conditions, providing a doorway for large molecules into the CNS. It has been well recognized that\n(See figure on next page.)

The current finding of HMGB1 downregulation in the CNS after systemic mAb was indicative of a direct intracranial effect, although the possibility of secondary reaction to peripheral neutralization cannot be completely excluded. Taken together, our results demonstrate the efficacy of systemic administration of anti-HMGB1 mAb on both\nFig. 7 (See legend on previous page.)\nneuropathic pain and anxiety comorbidity in the mouse model. The analgesic effect was comparable to that of gabapentin, which did not show anxiolytic effect. These findings in turn verify the causative roles of HMGB1 in both pain sensitization and negative affect after nerve injury and its validity and superiority as a therapeutic target."
