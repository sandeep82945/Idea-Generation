    "abstractText": "Fiber-supported catalysts have attracted much attention due to their large specific surface area, high catalytic activity, and good recyclability. Functional polyacrylonitrile fibers were prepared by immersion of polyacrylonitrile fibers at room temperature in an alkaline dopamine (pH 1\u20444 8.5) aqueous solution which can undergo self-polymerization and reduce silver ions to silver nanoparticles with mild reducibility and adsorption. The surface of the polyacrylonitrile fiber (PAN) was wrapped with a layer of polydopamine (PDA), and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were adsorbed on the surface of PDA, forming an efficient fiber catalyst. The morphology and chemical composition of the catalyst material were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalytic activity of the nanocomposite was evaluated for the reduction reaction of 4-nitrophenol using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) at 35 C with a material molar ratio of 1 : 10 and a fiber loaded catalysis dosage of 40 mg. The liquid phase yield can reach 98% in 30 minutes and can be reused after washing with ethanol. Moreover, the composite material exhibited a good stability up to 10 cycles without a significant loss of its catalytic activity. The results show that the catalyst is easy to recover from the reaction system and has maintained good stability and catalytic activity after many cycles.",

The chemical reduction method16 has been widely used due to the advantages of simple experimental conditions, low cost, and easy control. Commonly used reducing agents in chemical reduction methods are sodium borohydride, formaldehyde, etc., and silver nitrate is used as the silver source.17\nPolydopamine (PDA) is a bio-macromolecule formed by polymerization of phenolic compounds, which not only has strong adhesiveness to various surfaces, but also has high adsorption ability to metal ions.18 In addition, PDA can be used as a mild reducing agent to reduce Ag+ on different matrices.19 It\nBeijing Institute of Fashion Technology, 06@bi.edu.cn; clylzd@bi.edu.cn\nmation (ESI) available. See\n25911\nis also found that the O-and N-atoms in PDA can chelate with Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) to improve their durability. The PDA coatings have great potential in smart materials,20 biomedical eld21 and carrier of catalysis.22\nPolyacrylonitrile (PAN) bers have low-cost, large surface areas, close structure, high mechanical strength, good acid resistance and oxidation resistance, widely used in industry and our daily life. Besides, PAN bers are abundant of nitrile groups which can be easily converted into other groups23,24 like carboxyl, amide, amidoxime, etc. Furthermore, it can be employed as polymer ber-carriers extracted from the reaction system by simple ltration or woven into fabrics served in continuous ow of uid.25 Herein, the PAN ber catalyst loaded with Ag nanoparticles was prepared by reducing the silver ions to silver nanoparticles on the ber surface by using the adhesive and reductive properties of polydopamine."

In order to improve the hydrophilicity of the ber, the polyacrylonitrile ber is sulfonated with dilute sulfuric acid. The surface structure is destroyed and the surface morphology becomes rough. To make dopamine stick rmly to the PAN bers, the PAN bers were calcined in an oven at 200 C until the bers turned fromwhite to orange. Aer pre-oxidation, the longitudinal grooves were deepened and the surface morphology rougher. There is a sort of thin and dense dopamine coating, which can self-polymerize into polydopamine and reduce silver ion into nanoparticles adhered to the surface of the PAN bers. PDA was wrapped on the surface of PAN to form a core\u2013shell like functionalized ber (Fig. S1\u2020), and the amount of PDA on PAN ber increased with the increase of PDA concentration, which played an important role in the subsequent silver loading and catalytic performance (Table S1\u2020).

Therefore, the preprocessing strategy facilitates functionalization.\nThe composition and phase structure of the synthetic product were analyzed by XRD. Fig. 4 depicts the XRD pattern of PAN and silver nanoparticles modied bers. The sample used for XRD analysis was a silver nanoparticle with an average particle size of 100 nm. Because the high molecular strands in PAN are concentrated closely, a certain crystalline region is formed. The molecular arrangement in the crystalline region makes it difficult for other small molecules to enter the crystalline region, so there is a distinct peak at 2q \u00bc 17 .

It can be seen that the bers without Ag NPs are composed of C, N, and O elements, whose characteristic peaks\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nlocated at 248.4 eV, 399.4 eV and 531.9 eV, respectively. The ber loaded with Ag NPs has an additional Ag peak at 367.9 eV, indicating that the silver nanoparticles were successfully loaded on the dopamine-modied polyacrylonitrile ber. Fig. 5b exhibits the XPS narrow spectrum of Ag3d, which can be well tted into peaks at 367.9 eV (Ag3d5/2), and 373.9 eV (Ag3d3/2). Silver was conrmed to be attached to functional bers in a zero-valence form.\nStudy on catalytic performance of PAN-S-PDA-Ag\nFunctional polyacrylonitrile ber with different amount of silver loading was obtained by adjusting the concentration of AgNO3. The functional bers were used to catalyze the reduction reaction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), see Fig. 6. The reactant 4-NP (1 mmol), reducing agent sodium borohydride 0.378 g (10 mmol) and catalyst 40 mg PAN-PDA-Ag were used and reacted at 35 C. Upon adding 4-NP to the reaction bottle containing NaBH4, the solution becomes yellow\u2013green. When the 4-NP is fully converted to the product 4-aminophenol (4-AP), the solution becomes colorless, and the progress of the reaction is monitored by liquid chromatography. When the silver loading increased from 0.32% to 0.68%, the reaction time decreased from 24 minutes to 17 minutes, with the reaction yield more than 97% (Table 2). The concentration of silver nitrite further increased, the loading of silver rose but the catalytic efficiency of 4-nitrophenol was not increased obviously. So the ber with a load of 0.68% was selected to characterize its morphology and structure, as well as do the recycle ber catalyst for reaction.\nThe effects of temperature and ber dosage on 4-NP reduction were investigated. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the reaction takes 40 minutes to complete at 20 C, but at 50 C it takes only eight minutes to get 97% yield, so it is found that at 20 50 C, the faster the catalytic reaction proceeds as the temperature rises. In addition, no obvious change was detected when the amount of PAN-S-PDA-Ag was less than 15 mg. As the amount of ber was between 30 mg and 40 mg, the liquid-phase yield of the reaction could reach 99% within 1 h (Table S2\u2020).\nIn order to clarify the mechanism of functionalized ber catalysis, the control experiments of four different catalyst compositions were conducted (Table S3\u2020). It is found that the reduction of p-nitrophenol (4-NP) to p-aminophenol (4-AP) can be catalyzed within 30minutes when Ag and NaBH4 are working together as catalyst, neither Ag nor NaBH4 can work when using as catalyst alone. Based on the above experimental data and theoretical analysis, it is conrmed that the role of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) in functionalized bers acts as a carrier. It is convenient to recycle aer the reaction of the catalytic system.\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 25906\u201325911 | 25909\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The catalytic mechanism of p-nitrophenol catalyzed by poly-acrylonitrile bers loaded with nano-silver is proposed: the silver nanoparticles can adsorb NaBH4 and 4-NP molecules, and the electrons are transferred rapidly from BH4 to 4-NP via the surface of the silver nanoparticles during the reaction. The rapid transfer of electrons can increase the potential difference and further promote the transfer of electrons from BH4 to 4-NP, thus making the functional bers have superior catalytic properties.\nFig. 8 shows UV-Vis absorption spectra of raw material 4-NP, 4-AP standard sample and reaction system aer 30 minutes. The 4-NP standard has an absorption maximum at 400 nm, and the 4-AP standard has an absorption maximum at 303 nm. Aer 30 minutes of reaction system, a peak appeared at 300 nm, and the peak at 400 nm almost disappeared, indicating that 4- nitrophenol catalyzed by PAN-S-PDA-Ag was almost completely reduced to 4-AP. The PAN-S-PDA-Ag showed good stability for up to 10 cycles aer ethanol washing without signicant loss of catalytic activity (Fig. 9 and Table S4\u2020). The SEM images (Fig. S2\u2020) show lots of silver nanoparticles are still uniformly attached to the surface of the ber catalysts aer ten times of use. So the functionalized catalysts still maintain high catalytic performance."

PAN-S-PDA-Ag catalyst could reuse 10 times aer ethanol washing, and the catalytic activity has not decreased signicantly. The high catalytic activity and outstanding recoverability of PAN-S-PDA-Ag provide a more environmentally friendly, safe and economical choice for reducing nitrophenol compounds, which is expected to a big contribution to environmental protection."
