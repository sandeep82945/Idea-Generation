    "abstractText": "A large number of sensors work in the narrow bandpass circumstance. Meanwhile, some of them hold fine details merely along one and two dimensions. In order to efficiently simulate these sensors and devices, the one-step leapfrog hybrid implicit-explicit (HIE) algorithm with the complex envelope (CE) method and absorbing boundary condition is proposed in the narrow bandpass circumstance. To be more precise, absorbing boundary condition is implemented by the higher order convolutional perfectly matched layer (CPML) formulation to further enhance the absorption during the entire simulation. Numerical examples and their experiments are carried out to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show considerable agreement with the experiment and theory resolution. The relationship between the time step and mesh size can break the Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Levy condition which indicates the physical size/selection mesh size. Such a condition indicates that the proposed algorithm behaviors are considerably accurate due to the rational choice in discretized mesh. It also shows decrement in simulation duration and memory consumption compared with the other algorithms. In addition, absorption performance can be improved by employing the proposed higher order CPML algorithm during the whole simulation.",

            "text": "With the development of the electronic industry, sensors have become more important than ever before. Large numbers of sensors work in narrow bandpass circumstances or individual frequency [1,2]. Although the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm has been extensively employed in many applications, sensor simulation by the FDTD algorithm is severely limited by the inefficient bandpass calculation. Such conditions also restrict the development of the FDTD algorithm [3]. The reason is that the FDTD algorithm is based on the lowpass-sampling-theorem which can achieve considerable performance merely in broadband simulation [4]. The time step becomes small, resulting in an unacceptable simulation duration in bandpass problems. In order to efficiently simulate bandpass problems, investigation of the alternative FDTD algorithm has become urgent. Complex envelope (CE) method which is based on the bandpass-sampling-theorem shows considerable potential in bandpass problems [5]. In the CE method, the mesh size can be chosen according to the bandwidth rather than the maximum frequency, resulting in significantl improvement, both from the aspect of efficiency and accuracy. The CE method\nSensors 2022, 22, 4445. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22124445 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 4445 2 of 18\nwas firstly employed into the conventional FDTD algorithm [6]. Then, it was introduced into the unconditionally stable algorithms [7\u201310]. Through results, it can be concluded that these algorithms can receive better behavior compared with the lowpass-sampling-theorem based algorithms in bandpass simulation. With the development of sensors, structures have become more complex than ever before. For the fine details simulation, mesh size must be fine enough to satisfy the calculation accuracy. Due to the existence of the Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Levy (CFL) condition, the relationship between time step and mesh size is established [11]. Thus, time step must also be fine enough to maintain the stability of the algorithm. Such conditions also result in an extremely long simulation duration. In order to alleviate such conditions, unconditionally stable algorithms are proposed including the alternating direction implicit (ADI), locally one-dimension (LOD), split-step (SS) procedures and others [12\u201315]. It has been testified that the unconditionally stable algorithms are merely efficient in fine details with all directions. When simulating fine details along one and two dimensions, more than six matrices should be calculated at each time step resulting in increments of memory consumption and simulation duration. Although these algorithms can overcome the CFL condition, the effectiveness of the algorithm decreases significantly. In order to alleviate such conditions, a hybrid implicit-explicit (HIE) procedure is proposed [16]. Through explicitly updating components in a single direction and implicitly updating the others, the HIE procedure can obtain considerable performance in low-dimensions [17,18]. However, the HIE procedure is still a split-field updating procedure which increases the memory and simulation duration [19]. To alleviate such conditions, the one-step leapfrog scheme is employed into the HIE procedure [20]. Because the computer cannot solve infinite computational domains, an adequate boundary condition must be employed at the boundaries [11]. To simulate infinite computational domain in finite space, perfectly matched layer (PML) is regarded as one of the most powerful and efficient absorbing boundary conditions [21]. The original PML formulation is a split-field scheme which shows limitations in absorption and resources [22]. Unsplit-field formulation is proposed to alleviate such conditions including convolutional PML (CPML), stretched coordinate PML (SC-PML) and complex-frequency-shifted PML (CFS-PML) schemes [23\u201325]. Although they hold advantages in reducing late-time reflections and absorbing low-frequency evanescent waves, reflection at the low frequency still needs to be enhanced [26]. Higher order PML formulation is proposed to not only enhance the absorption in the time domain but also absorb low-frequency propagation waves in the frequency domain [27,28]. The original higher order PML formulation must introduce six auxiliary variables during calculation which occupies large number of computational resources [29]. To alleviate such conditions, the higher order PML formulation with four auxiliary variables is proposed [30]. In addition, existing higher order formulation is mainly based on the CFS-PML scheme which shows limitation in complex media. The higher order CPML is proposed to overcome these drawbacks [31,32]. It has been testified that compared with the other schemes, it can significantly decrease the computational complexity with considerable absorption in complex structures and media. In order to simulate complex sensors and components whose fine details merely exist along one and two dimensions, several algorithms have been proposed which still have their own limitations. The original HIE procedures with PML (NPML) and CFS-PML are proposed in two dimensions which cannot be employed into the practical employment [33,34]. Recently, the HIE procedure and its leapfrog scheme with higher order PML are proposed in three dimensions [35\u201337]. However, they can merely be employed in vacuum and magnetized plasma. The formulation for dielectric material still needs to be investigated. From another aspect, all of the existing absorbing boundary conditions for the HIE procedure and leapfrog scheme are based on the NPML and CFS-PML formulation [35\u201339]. These algorithms must be modified according to the different computational domains due to the media-dependent formulation. Computation complexity\nSensors 2022, 22, 4445 3 of 18\nincreases significantly due to the employment of higher order formulation. The reduction in computation complexity also needs to be further investigated. In order to efficiently simulate sensors with fine details in narrow bandpass circumstances, the one-step leapfrog HIE procedure is proposed with the CE method and higher order CPML formulation. The proposed algorithm takes advantages of leapfrog HIE procedure, CE method and higher order CPML formulation, in terms of the calculating of fine details along one and two dimensions, simulating bandpass problems and enhancing absorption. Numerical examples and experiments are carried out for the illustration of effectiveness. It can be concluded that results simulated by employing the proposed algorithm show considerable agreement with the experiments and theory resolution. Compared to the other algorithms, the proposed algorithm also shows significant improvement in accuracy, efficiency and absorption."

            "text": "Within microwave components, micro-strip components can be regarded one of the most powerful and widely spread. Among some of them, an extremely thin metal patch is located on the surface of the device. Thus, by employing the unconditionally stable algorithms and conventional explicit algorithms directly, uniform extremely fine mesh must be employed within the entire computational domain which results in significant increments of memory and duration. In order to alleviate such conditions, the HIE procedure is introduced for the fine details along one and two dimensions. Here, a micro-strip filter for sensors system is employed for the illustration. The sketch picture of the structure is shown as Figure 2. Through the establishment of a rectangular coordinate system, a complex and oblique patch can be expressed and located by the specific coordinate location, as shown in Table 2. Along the vertex coordinates of the patch, the entire structure can be established in the CAD mechanical drawing. The coordinate origin is located at the middle of the left bottom edge. In order to clarify the position of each point, Figure 2a shows each point of the patch from xoy plane. The enlargement of the left side of the structure is shown in Figure 2b. The right side of the structure can be obtained through the symmetry principle.

The performance can be significantly improved by\nemploying the higher order formulation from both the aspect of late-time reflections and\nmaximum relative reflection error (MRRE). In addition, by employing the CE method,\nabsorption can be significantly improved in the bandpass circumstance. Thus, bandpass-\nsampling-theorem based algorithms can obtain better performance compared with the\nFDTD-HPML.

It can be concluded from Table 3 that the employment of higher order formulation and CE method results in the increment of simulation duration and computational resources due to the increment of many more coefficients, auxiliary variables, field components and matrices. Thus, compared with the PML scheme and explicit schemes, time and memory occupied by the HPML and HIE procedure increases significantly. Although the CE method slightly increases the memory consumption during the simulation, iteration steps decrease at the same time due to the enlargement of the time step. It should be noticed that CE method alleviates the time increment problem of the implicit algorithm with lower CFLNs. The proposed scheme can obtain a 13.7% time improvement compared to the FDTD-PML. With the improvement of CFLNs, simulation duration can be decreased by enlarging the time step resulting in an improvement of efficiency. With CFLN = 8, the CE method based implicit algorithm shows more than an 80% time improvement compared with the FDTD-\nSensors 2022, 22, 4445 11 of 18\nPML.

Through Figure 8a,c, it can be observed that these curves obtained by different PML algorithms are almost overlapped. Such conditions indicate that these algorithms almost hold the same computational accuracy during the calculation in the entire frequency band. Through Figure 8b,d, it can be observed that the curves show shifting compared to the lower CFLNs. Such conditions indicate that the accuracy of algorithms decrease with the enlargement of CFLNs. The reason is that the numerical dispersion increases with the enlargement of the time step which results in the degeneration of accuracy. The curves obtained by the proposed scheme and CE-LHIE-HPML hold the least shifting, indicating the best accuracy. It can also be concluded that compared with the lowpass-samplingtheorem based algorithms, algorithms that are based on the CE method hold better accuracy in the entire frequency band. In summary, simulation and measurement shows the same conclusion with that obtained in the time domain simulation. In addition, all of these algorithms show considerable agreement with the experiment. Such a condition indicate that the proposed algorithm can be extensively employed in practical engineering. However, there is still error between simulation and experiment. The reason can be described from the following aspects: (1) The manufacturing process tolerance results in disagreement compared to the size in the simulation. The generation of shifting is caused by such a condition. Thus, the manufacturing process tolerance overcoming the technique becomes increasingly important; (2) The measurement of the filter system is a precision-type instrument, especially for the probe. The pollution of the devices also leads to shifting in the experiment; (3) Due to the existence of the complex and oblique patch, the conventional conformal method in the Yee\u2019s grid becomes inaccurate. Conformal error causes occur at the oblique and complex part. Such conditions also result in the curves shifting. Thus, improvement on the conformal method for the HIE algorithm is also worth investigating."
