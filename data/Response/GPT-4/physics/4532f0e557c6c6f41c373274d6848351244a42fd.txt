Exploration of Structural Derivatives: Given the promising activity of certain neolignans, especially compound 1, future work could focus on synthesizing and testing structural derivatives of the most active compounds. Altering functional groups or the core structure could enhance potency, selectivity, and reduce toxicity. The aim would be to refine the balance between antitrypanosomal efficacy and cytotoxicity to mammalian cells.

Mechanism of Action Studies: The paper suggests that compounds 1, 2, and 4 potentially act by destabilizing tubulin dynamics at the vinca site. Detailed mechanistic studies using biophysical and biochemical assays could provide insights into the exact interactions at the molecular level. This could include investigating the effects on tubulin polymerization and depolymerization, and the role of specific amino acid residues in the binding and efficacy of these compounds.

Resistance Development Studies: With the ongoing challenge of drug resistance in parasitic diseases, it would be valuable to study the potential for resistance development against these neolignans in T. cruzi. Long-term exposure studies could help understand how quickly resistance might develop and the mechanisms involved, guiding the design of combination therapies or modifications to the compounds to counteract resistance.

In Vivo Efficacy and Safety Studies: Moving beyond in vitro studies, the next step would involve evaluating the most promising neolignans in animal models of Chagas disease. These studies should assess not only the efficacy in reducing parasite load but also safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics to identify potential candidates for clinical trials.

QSAR and Drug Design Optimization: Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies could be conducted to correlate the chemical structure of neolignans with their antiparasitic activity and toxicity. This computational approach can help in identifying crucial structural features responsible for activity and toxicity, guiding the rational design of more effective and safer neolignan derivatives for Chagas disease therapy.
