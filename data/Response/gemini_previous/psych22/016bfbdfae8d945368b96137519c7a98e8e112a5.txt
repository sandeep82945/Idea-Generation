1. **Investigate the longitudinal stability and predictive validity of the AEBS-IT.** This would involve following a group of participants over time to see how their scores on the AEBS-IT change, and to examine whether these changes are associated with changes in eating behaviors, weight status, or other health outcomes.


2. **Examine the cross-cultural validity of the AEBS-IT.** This would involve administering the AEBS-IT to participants from different cultures and comparing their scores to see if the factor structure and psychometric properties of the tool are consistent across cultures.


3. **Explore the relationship between AEBS-IT scores and neurobiological markers of addiction.** This could involve using brain imaging or other techniques to examine whether individuals with high AEBS-IT scores have different brain activity or structure than individuals with low AEBS-IT scores.


4. **Investigate the effectiveness of interventions for reducing AEBS-IT scores.** This could involve conducting randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of different interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, or medication, in reducing AEBS-IT scores and improving eating behaviors and weight status.


5. **Examine the relationship between AEBS-IT scores and other psychological factors, such as personality traits, coping mechanisms, and stress.** This could help to identify individuals who are at risk for developing eating problems and to develop targeted interventions for these individuals.
