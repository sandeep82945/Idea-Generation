"The disadvantage is that in the comparable price input–output model used in this study, the price deflator of the tertiary sector is determined by the added value coefficient. Due to data limitations, the added value coefficient in the statistical yearbook cannot cover all sectors. Thus, the added value coefficient of other service industries is used to deflate the remaining industries, which will slightly affect the accuracy of the data. Besides, price factors such as carbon prices and policy trends of various provinces need to be incorporated into the relevant influencing factors in the study content, so as to achieve a more complete development strategy for China’s LCE."
