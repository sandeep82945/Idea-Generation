"The observed phase transitions are entirely pH-driven. Strikingly, we observed a transition to a zinc-free cubic insulin state despite the presence of zinc in solution. We argue that these transitions are a result of the increase in electrostatic repulsion between neighboring GluB13 residues as a result of pH variation. Further investigations of these pH-driven phase transitions, in terms of varying zinc-to-insulin and thiocyanate-to-insulin ratios, are required to test our hypotheses, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments to yield higher resolution structural models."
