    "abstractText": "Bortezomib has been successful for treatment of multiple myeloma, but not against solid tumors, and toxicities of neuropathy, thrombocytopenia and the emergence of resistance have triggered efforts to find alternative proteasome inhibitors. Bis-benzylidine piperidones such as RA190 covalently bind ADRM1/RPN13, a ubiquitin receptor that supports recognition of polyubiquitinated substrates of the proteasome and their subsequent deububiqutination and degradation. While these candidate RPN13 inhibitors (iRPN13) show promising anticancer activity in mouse models of cancer, they have suboptimal drug-like properties. Here we describe Up284, a novel candidate iRPN13 possessing a central spiro-carbon ring in place of RA190\u2019s problematic piperidone core. Cell lines derived from diverse cancer types (ovarian, triple negative breast, colon, cervical and prostate cancers, multiple myeloma and glioblastoma) were sensitive to Up284, including several lines resistant to bortezomib or cisplatin. Up284 and cisplatin showed synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro. Up284-induced cytotoxicity was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, accumulation of very high molecular weight polyubiquitinated protein aggregates, an unfolded protein response and the early onset of apoptosis. Up284 and RA190, but not bortezomib, enhanced antigen presentation in vitro. Up284 cleared from plasma in a few hours and accumulated in major organs by 24 h. A single dose of Up284, when administered to mice intra peritoneally or orally, inhibited proteasome function in both muscle and tumor for >48 h. Up284 was well tolerated by mice in repeat dose studies. Up284 demonstrated therapeutic activity in xenograft, syngeneic and genetically-engineered murine models of ovarian cancer.

            "text": "Bortezomib has been successful for treatment of multiple myeloma, but not against solid\ntumors, and toxicities of neuropathy, thrombocytopenia and the emergence of resistance\nhave triggered efforts to find alternative proteasome inhibitors. Bis-benzylidine piperidones\nsuch as RA190 covalently bind ADRM1/RPN13, a ubiquitin receptor that supports recogni-\ntion of polyubiquitinated substrates of the proteasome and their subsequent deububiqutina-\ntion and degradation. While these candidate RPN13 inhibitors (iRPN13) show promising\nanticancer activity in mouse models of cancer, they have suboptimal drug-like properties.\nHere we describe Up284, a novel candidate iRPN13 possessing a central spiro-carbon ring\nin place of RA190\u2019s problematic piperidone core. Cell lines derived from diverse cancer\ntypes (ovarian, triple negative breast, colon, cervical and prostate cancers, multiple mye-\nloma and glioblastoma) were sensitive to Up284, including several lines resistant to bortezo-\nmib or cisplatin. Up284 and cisplatin showed synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro.

            "text": "Targeted protein modification using small molecule covalent inhibitors is a validated approach for the treatment of cancers (e.g. carfilzomib, ibrutinib, afatinib and osimeritinib), and they appear less prone to resistance [1]. Addressing the emergence of drug resistance is a key challenge in cancer therapy, for example patients with high grade ovarian cancer who relapse at high rates despite aggressive debulking surgery and first line platinum-based chemotherapy. Michael acceptors are covalent inhibitors that act by forming covalent bonds with cysteines or other nucleophilic residues in the target protein. Several Michael acceptor-based inhibitors targeting the proteasome\u2019s 19S Regulatory Particle (19S RP) have potential for cancer treatment, and VLX1570 advanced to clinical testing [2\u20134]. However, many are as Pan-Assay interference compounds (PAINS) which tend to react non-specifically. A number of in silico filters are used in drug design to screen out PAINS [5, 6].\nSeveral proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib), targeting its 20S\ncatalytic particle (20S CP) are licensed for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) [7, 8]. These peptide-based drugs have greatly improved the prognosis of MM patients, but in early phase trials these drugs were ineffective against solid tumors [9]. Additionally, prolonged treatment of MM patients is associated with off-target neurotoxicity, thrombocytopenia and eventually resistance [8, 10]. This suggests a need for a new class of proteasome inhibitors with a distinct mechanism of action and molecular scaffold to overcome these limitations.\nAn emerging strategy is to target substrate recognition and deubiquitination mediated by\nthe 19S RP as it selects polyubiquitinated proteins as substrates and prepares them for proteasomal degradation via deubiquitination and unfolding [11]. The 19S RP is pivotal for constitutive 26S proteasome activity and its inhibition causes a rapid and toxic buildup of its substrate polyubiquitinated proteins in very high molecular weight aggregates. Ovarian cancer cells, like MM, produce dramatic amounts of misfolded proteins because of their aberrant metabolism [12]. Consequently, these cancer cells heavily rely on proteasomes to maintain protein homeostasis, thereby creating a therapeutic window [13, 14]. Proteasomes are also used to modulate the levels of regulatory proteins and thereby control complex cellular processes such as cell cycle and DNA repair that are critical to tumor growth and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy.\nThe 19S RP subunit protein RPN13, which is encoded by ADRM1, has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of ovarian cancer and several other types of solid and liquid tumors [15\u201321]. RPN13 was found non-essential for the survival of normal cells but is critical in numerous cancer cell lines, including cells from solid tumors [15, 22, 23]. Indeed, ADRM1 has been proposed as a driver oncogene in ovarian cancer [21]. RPN13 works in concert with RPN10 to recognize with high affinity the extended K48-linked polyubiquitinated chains marking proteins for proteasomal degradation [11]. UCH37, a proteasomal deubiquitinase (DUB), binds to and is activated by RPN13 [24]. Deubiquitination is a prerequisite for further substrate unfolding and degradation by proteasome. Thus, inhibition of RPN13 has the potential block all proteolytic activity of the constitutive 26S proteasome by preventing substrate recognition and deubiquitination, whereas the three licensed proteasome inhibitors only target one of the three proteolytic activities (chymotryptic) encoded by its 20S catalytic core, limiting their potency and potentially providing a window for resistance to emerge [11].\nRA190 was the first putative small molecule RPN13 inhibitor (iRPN13) [19]. RA190 inhibits\ntumor growth in ovarian, cervical, and MM xenograft models. Intriguingly, it retains potency in bortezomib-resistant MM cells. However, RA190 and its more potent analogs have suboptimal characteristics for a drug, including PAINS characteristics because of its central piperidone core. Chang described novel iRPN13 possessing instead a central spiro-carbon ring that\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 2 / 29\nDirected Medical Research Programs Ovarian Cancer Research Program, the U.S. Department of Defense grant OC210370.

This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials\ndoes not fall within the PAINS category [5, 6, 25]. The spiro-scaffold offers ring strain and limits number of stable confirmations compared to a cyclohexane moiety, but a very strong withdrawing group, such as\u2013NO2, on the aromatic ring is required for cytotoxicity against tumor cells. The cytotoxicity of 3,4 and 3,5 spirocyclic compounds bearing\u2013NO2 functional groups was similar, but due to better access to raw materials and synthetic possibilities, the 3,5 spirocyclic compounds were further developed (US20190365726). The 3,5 spirocyclic compound Up109 emerged as a promising candidate that bound to RPN13 in vitro more potently than RA190 and caused accumulation of high molecular weight (HMW) polyubiquitinated (polyUb) proteins, unresolved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis. Furthermore, Up109 treatment inhibited in vivo proteasome function and growth of ovarian cancer xenograft ES2 (US20190365726). However, issues with the solubility of Up109 and toxicity necessitated further development of a more drug-like iRPN13.\nHere we describe the development of a spirocyclic iRPN13, Up284. Up284 shows promising\nsafety, pharmacokinetics and therapeutic activity in several murine models of ovarian cancer. Up284 also synergizes with the platinum-based chemotherapeutic cisplatin that acts by inducing DNA damage. DNA damage repair mechanisms are compromised frequently in ovarian cancer and are dependent upon proteasome function. Unlike 20S proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib), iRPN13 do not target immunoproteasomes as for substrate recognition they utilize PA28, which lacks RPN13, instead of 19S RP. Further Up284 promotes antigen presentation by tumor cells [26\u201330], a prerequisite to effective antitumor immunity."

            "text": "Analogs of Up109 were rationally designed to improve solubility and other key drug properties with a focus on the electron withdrawing groups (EWG), and the central ring nitrogen substituents. In designing more drug-like iRPN13, we screened out compounds with PAINS features, using both the \u2018bad apple\u2019 algorithm [5] and the SwissADME web tool [6]. The functional EWG (-NO2) and acryloyl moieties in Up109 were considered likely to contribute toxicities and poor solubility, and thus nitrile (-CN), another strong EWG, was substituted on both sides of the rings (Fig 1).\nDifferent substituents were examined on the central ring nitrogen atom, and these analogs\nwere screened for cancer cell cytotoxicity (Table 1). While inclusion of acryloyl provided the most potent compound of the series, Up285, its removal did not profoundly reduce the cytotoxicity, suggesting the potential of Up284. Interestingly, the 3,5 spiro ring analogs were more potent than the 3,4 equivalents. Other central ring nitrogen substituents tested only compromised drug cytotoxicity (Table 1). Furthermore, Up284 also possesses a strong score (5) for drug-like characteristics based on the Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, Egan and Muegge rules, along with good synthetic accessibility. Hence Up284 was advanced for further study.\nUp284 inhibits proliferation of cancer cells of diverse origin\nTo determine whether Up284 cytotoxicity is specific for particular cancer types, a panel of cell lines derived from various cancer types and normal tissues were treated with Up284 for 72 h and IC50 determined. Up284 demonstrated potency against the growth of most of the cancer types, suggesting broad applicability, but relatively spared normal cells, implying a significant therapeutic window (Fig 1B). However, several cell lines were less sensitive to Up284, notably MCF7, T47D, BT549 and C33A. This panel included cell lines isolated from patients with\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 9 / 29\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221.g001\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 10 / 29\ndrug-resistant disease (PEA2, PEO4) or pre-treatment (PEA1, PEO1) [35] that showed similar sensitivity to Up284. Likewise, parental RPMI8226 and ANBL6 multiple myeloma cell lines and those selected in vitro for resistance to bortezomib (-V10R) were similarly very sensitive to Up284. HCT116 cells, regardless of Tp53-/-, Tp53+/- or Tp53285R, were similarly sensitive suggesting Up284-induced cell death occurs independently of Tp53 signaling (Fig 1B).\nUp284 covalently binds RPN13\nEarlier we demonstrated that biotinylated RA190 (RA190B) covalently binds to Cys88 of RPN13 [19]. Taking a similar approach, the central ring nitrogen of Up284, and that of an inactive spiro analog Up108, were each modified with biotin (Up284B and Up108B respectively) and their capability to bind covalently to RPN13 examined. Briefly, E. coli DE3 were transformed with an expression vector for 6His tagged RPN13 (MW 46.8KDa) and its expFADRM1ression induced. A crude detergent lysate was incubated with 50 \u03bcM of RA190B, Up284B or Up108B for 45 min at 4\u02daC. Next, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, probed with HRP-linked streptavidin and binding visualized by chemiluminescent substrate. E. coli DE3 bacterial lysate was used as a negative control. Up284B demonstrated robust labeling of 6His-RPN13, whereas the inactive molecule Up108B (with dichloro moieties on the aromatic rings) failed to react detectably (Fig 2A, Upper panel). The membrane was stripped and probed with RPN13 antibody to confirm its expression (Fig 2A, lower panel). Labeling was dose dependent, and Up284B labeled 6His-RPN13 more strongly than RA190B (Fig 2B).\nNext, the covalent binding profile of Up284B in detergent lysates of the human cancer cell\nlines A2780 (Fig 2C) and ES2 (Fig 2D) was assessed. Up284B bound with specificity to a cellular protein of 42kDa, a molecular weight consistent with that of RPN13 (42.1KDa), and more strongly than seen for RA190B.\nUp284 competes RA190B binding to 42KDa cellular target, RPN1\n3A competition assay was performed by pre-treating HeLa cell lysate with non-biotinylated compounds (5 \u03bcM) for 45 min at 4\u02daC, including RA190 as a \u2018cold\u2019 competitor and both\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 11 / 29\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 12 / 29\nbortezomib and DMSO vehicle as negative controls. These lysates were then probed with RA190B (20 \u03bcM) for 45 min at 4\u02daC, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with HRP-linked streptavidin. Upon chemiluminescent visualization, it was evident that all the cytotoxic spirocyclic compounds Up104, Up109, Up284 and Up285 competed like RA190 for RA190B binding to the 42KDa cellular protein (Fig 2E). In contrast the non-cytotoxic Up111 (Table 1) did not compete, as seen with the negative controls bortezomib and DMSO (Fig 2E).\nCellular deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are proteases that remove ubiquitin, or ubiqui-\ntin-like molecules, or remodel ubiquitin-chains on target proteins, and many contain active site cysteines [36]. To examine whether Up284 non-specifically inhibits cellular DUB enzymes, total cellular DUB activity was measured using the substrate Ub-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) (Fig 2F) in SKOV3 cells treated 1 h with 5 \u03bcM Up109 or Up284 and lysed. No reduction in total lysate DUB enzymatic activity was noted with either compound; N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, 1 mM) served as a positive control for DUB inhibition."

            "text": "Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) assesses thermal stabilization of proteins upon ligand binding and is used extensively to detect drug interactions by implementing a thermal shift in the cellular context [37, 38]. The assay involves drug treatment of cells, heating to denature and precipitate proteins in a thermocycler with a specified gradient of temperatures, cell lysis by freeze/thaw cycles, and the separation of cell debris and aggregates from the soluble protein fraction by centrifugation. Whereas unbound proteins denature and precipitate at elevated temperatures, ligand-bound proteins remain in solution. The proportion of individual proteins remaining in solution can be detected by quantitative Western blotting. In repeated experiments, treatment of SKOV3, 10 \u03bcM Up284 for 30 min stabilized RPN13 to heat treatment compared to vehicle (DMSO) treated samples, such that it resisted denaturation to higher temperatures (Fig 3A and 3B). There was no impact on other control proteins tested, including a house keeping protein (GAPDH) and proteasome subunits (RPN2 and USP14). This data is consistent with on-target Up284 activity against RPN13 and supports its specificity.\nUp284 enhances antigen presentation in vitro\nThe approved 20S proteasome inhibitors block the function of both the constitutive proteasome and the immunoproteasome [39]. This likely accounts for their side effects of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia because the immunoproteasome is constitutively expressed in hematopoietic cells [40]. Unlike the constitutive proteasome, the immunoproteasome does not require RPN13 (the 19S RP is replaced by PA28 that does not contain RPN13), and this may account for the absence of the above side effects in mice treated with iRPN13 [40, 41]. Notably, the immunoproteasome is central in antigen presentation, and thus the impact of Up284 versus bortezomib upon presentation of an endogenous model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), was examined in a murine cervical cancer model cell line, TC1, stably expressing OVA. TC1-OVA cells were treated with Up284, RA190 or bortezomib (0.25 \u03bcM) for 12 h. The cells were then fixed and stained with a monoclonal antibody specific for the OVA MHC class I epitope (SIINFEKL) when presented on H-2Kb, and binding was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig 3C).\nthe lysates (40 \u03bcg) were subject to SDS-PAGE, PVDF membrane transfer, and then probed with HRP-streptavidin. The membrane was stained with Ponceau solution to confirm equal loading. F) SKOV3 cells were treated with the indicated compounds (5 \u03bcM) for 1 h, and then total cellular DUB activity determined by measuring Ub-AMC cleavage over time. NEM (1 mM) used as positive control.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 13 / 29\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 14 / 29\nIndeed, Up284 enhanced MHC class I antigen presentation by the TC1-OVA cells, whereas bortezomib did not (Fig 3C). This finding suggests inhibition of the constitutional proteasome by RA190 and Up284 causes an accumulation of ovalbumin, but neither inhibits the immunoproteasome responsible for processing the ovalbumin for MHC class I presentation. By contrast, bortezomib inhibits both the constitutional proteasome and immunoproteasome such that ovalbumin accumulates but the excess is not processed for MHC class I presentation.\nUp284 cytotoxicity is associated with ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction\nLike RA190 and Up109, Up284 and its cytotoxic analogs (Table 1) also caused profound accumulation by 12 h of HMW polyUb proteins in ES2 cells (Fig 4A), and as early as 1 h (Fig 4B and 4C), to a molecular weight greater than seen with bortezomib. Depletion of mono- and diubiquitin levels was evident at 12 h, but not after only 4 h of treatment (Fig 4A and 4B). This implies Up284, unlike bortezomib, blocks a DUB activity. Up284 does not globally inhibit cellular DUBs (Fig 2F). This suggests Up284 may instead indirectly inhibit a proteasome-associated DUB by blocking substrate recognition, such as UCH37 whose activity is dramatically enhanced upon RPN13 binding to polyubiquitinated protein substrate [42].\nAccumulation of these HMW polyUb proteins by Up284 promotes UPR signaling, includ-\ning rapid upregulation of CHOP10 mRNA levels in OVCAR3 cells (Fig 4D). Furthermore, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected using Amplex red fluorescence after treatment of ES2 cells with compounds (Fig 4E), a mechanism that contributes to bortezomibinduced cytotoxicity [43, 44]. Early apoptosis was evident in two ovarian cancer cells (TOV21G and ES2) by assessing Annexin-V labeling on the cell surface; Up284 increased the fraction of Annexin-V positive cells by 12 h of treatment (Fig 4F), consistent with rapid onset of early apoptosis.\nSince ubiquitin signaling plays a critical role in DNA damage repair, and Up284 causes a\ndepletion in the monoubiquitin pool (Fig 4A), Up284 was tested for potential synergy with cisplatin. In comparing apoptosis induced at 12 h by Up284 alone or in combination with cisplatin, there was no indication of synergy at this early time point, and indeed cisplatin alone had minimal impact (Fig 4F). By contrast, when examining checkerboard combinations of Up284 and cisplatin for cytotoxicity at 72 h, there was clear evidence of synergy in several cell lines including PEA2 and PACS (S1 Fig). We also observed synergy with Up284 and doxorubicin combination in SKOV3 cells (S2 Fig).\nThe rapid onset of apoptosis caused by proteasome inhibitors has also been associated with\ncompromised mitochondrial function [45]. To examine its impact on cellular energetics, we examined in ES2 cells whether changes in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) or glycolysis occurred with Up284 treatment (Fig 4G and 4H). Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) dysfunction, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and anaerobic acid production via extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were assessed using a Seahorse XF flux analyzer. OCR was measured at baseline and after addition of oligomycin, a complex V inhibitor, followed by an uncoupler, carbonilcyanide p-triflouromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), then rotenone (complex I inhibitor), and finally antimycin (complex III inhibitor) (Fig 4G). Upon 12 h of Up284 treatment there was a significant decrease in OCR, both in basal and respiration\nplate in 2 mL/well in complete medium. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u02daC, cells were treated with Up284, RA190 or bortezomib (0.25 \u03bcM) or vehicle for 12 h. The cells were then washed with PBS, fixed and stained for 1 h at RT with APC-labeled monoclonal anti-mouse H-2Kb bound to SIINFEKL antibody (25-D1.16, Biolegend), and binding was analyzed by flow cytometry.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 15 / 29\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 16 / 29\nstimulated with FCCP, and ATP production. Up284 did not impact proton leakage. Overall OXPHOS inhibition by Up284 significantly reduced the mitochondrial energy reserve in ES2 cells, which is essential for cell survival. Furthermore, Up284 treatment showed a decrease in mitochondrial ATP production by inhibiting the OXPHOS. A trend for reduction in ECAR, a surrogate measure of glycolysis, was observed after 24 h Up284 treatment (Fig 4H). These observations suggest that Up284 affects ES2 cancer cells by inhibition of glycolysis and OXPHOS, thereby ultimately reducing mitochondrial ATP production as previously shown with RA413S, a bis-benylidine piperidone iRPN13 candidate [46].\nStability of Up284 in plasma and liver microsomes. As a prelude to in vivo studies, the\nhe stability of Up284 in murine and human plasma was first assessed (S1 Table). Up284 was stable in murine and human plasma (<10% degradation) after incubating for 1 hour and analysis by HPLC-MS system. To determine binding capabilities of Up284 to mouse plasma proteins, LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by spiking 1 \u03bcM Up284 into plasma and dialyzing 5h against buffer to seek equilibrium. Up284 showed 98% mouse plasma protein binding (S2 Table). Up284 stability in murine and human liver microsomes, either with and without nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), was also examined (S3 Table). Up284 was degraded in the absence and presence of NADPH. There was ~50% degradation in human or mouse liver microsomes without NAPDH with an additional ~10% degradation in the presence of NAPDH suggesting minimal NADPH-dependent metabolism (S3 Table). These findings are similar to those for RA190, but RA183 was more rapidly broken down in human and mouse microsomes [47]."

Bortezomib treatment likewise significantly reduced red blood cell numbers, hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to vehicle-treated mice albeit within normal ranges. However, in addition, bortezomib significantly reduced granulocyte and platelet counts, consistent with the clinical experience. The clinical chemistry parameters of the Up284, or bortezomib, -treated mice were not significantly different to vehicle control, with the exception of a reduction in alkaline phosphatase levels (S12 Table).\nDosing of Up284 was tested in female Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice (n = 3/group) every third day and after 3 doses the MTD for Up284 was 40 mg/kg for IP delivery (60 mg/kg was toxic) suggesting that its MTD is independent of mouse strain.\nAssessment of Up284 in vivo on-target activity using proteasome reporter gene\nAs seen with RA190 and bortezomib, in vitro treatment of ES2 cells stably expressing the 4UbFL reporter for 4 h with Up284 resulted in its dose-dependent stabilization as indicated by a fold increase in luminescence over baseline (Fig 5A). To test for proteasome inhibition by Up284 in vivo, leg muscle of live CD1 mice was transduced with the 4UbFL reporter DNA construct by electroporation. Two days later, luciferin was injected IP and the baseline enzymic activity of luciferase in the transduced muscle tissue was visualized as bioluminescence within this region of interest (ROI) using an IVIS imager. A control group (n = 5) of mice was treated IP with vehicle alone and another group (n = 5) treated IP with a single dose of Up284 (40 mg/kg). After 4h, 24h and 48h the mice were again injected with luciferin, imaged and bioluminescence was quantified (Fig 5B). Up284 significantly enhanced bioluminescence levels over>48h. In another experiment, Up284 was delivered PO once at 40mg/kg to CD1 mice (n = 7) and compared with licensed orally-available 20S proteasome inhibitor ixazomib at 10 mg/kg (7.5mg/kg is therapeutic dose [48]). Surprisingly, Up284 better stabilized the reporter than ixazomib, suggesting better accessibility to solid tissue like muscle (Fig 5C).\nPharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of Up284 in mice\nFor a pilot assessment of its tissue distribution, CD1 mice were injected with one dose of Up284 (40 mg/kg, IV) and tissues collected 24 h later. Up284 levels were analyzed in all major tissues (brain, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung and spleen) by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). Up284 accumulated in all the tissues, particularly the lungs (Fig 5D), but was low in plasma.\nThis was followed by a more detailed pharmacokinetic study, in which CD1 (n = 4; 8 weeks old, 26.8\u00b13g) mice were administered a single dose of Up284, either IV (5 mg/kg), PO (50 mg/ kg), or IP (20 mg/kg), and thereafter serial blood plasma samples were analyzed for Up284 levels by LC\u2013MS/MS. The animals were randomly assigned to the treatment groups and fasted for 4 h before dosing (S13 Table). Nine time points for IV and IP (5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480 and 1440 min) and eight time points for PO (15, 30, 60,120, 240, 360, 480 and 1440 min) administration were set for this pharmacokinetic study. Each of the time point treatment group included 4 animals. Mice were injected IP with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (150 mg/kg) prior to drawing the blood in microtainers containing K3EDTA via retro-orbital bleeding. Blood samples were centrifuged 10 min at 3000 rpm. Brain samples (right lobe) were collected and weighted. All samples were immediately processed, flash-frozen and stored at -70\u02daC until subsequent analysis. The average Up284 plasma concentrations data for IV (S14 Table), IP (S15 Table), and PO (S16 Table) dosed groups were analyzed graphically (Fig 5E). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from mean concentration-time data using non-compartmental methods in Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.3 (Certara, Princeton, NJ)). Using the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 18 / 29\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 19 / 29\nMethod of Bailer, there was no different in dose normalized AUClast by any route of administration (S17 Table). In summary, the calculated oral and IP bioavailability for Up284 was 23% and 87% respectively (S17 Table). No obvious adverse effects were observed during this PK study.\nUp284 treatment studies in mouse models of ovarian cancer\nOrthotopic ES2-luc human ovarian cancer xenograft model. The treatment efficacy of\nUp284 was first examined in female nude mice bearing ES2 human ovarian tumor expressing firefly luciferase (ES2-luc). Briefly mice were injected IP with ES2-luc cells, as ovarian cancer primarily spreads through the peritoneum, and it is the origin of primary peritoneal cancer. After four days, these mice were injected IP with luciferin and bioluminescence imaged by IVIS imager as a surrogate of tumor burden. Mice were randomized and treated IP with vehicle alone or 10 mg/kg Up284 every 3 days for 3 weeks. Bioluminescent imaging was performed by IVIS 12 and 21 days later. Treatment with Up284 significantly reduced ES2-luc xenograft tumor burden (p = 0.0002) compared to vehicle-treated mice at both time points and increased overall survival (p = 0.005) (Fig 6A\u20136C). Thus the Up284 treatment effect, presumably via direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, is evident in immunodeficient mice.\nID8 syngeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer\nBortezomib and iRPN13 can trigger an immunogenic cell death promoted via cell surface display of calreticulin [16, 49]. Because of a potential role for antitumor immunity, the therapeutic effect of Up284 was tested against the syngeneic transplantable murine ovarian tumor model ID8-luc expressing firefly luciferase in C57BL6 with an intact immune system. Female C57BL6 mice (4\u20136 weeks) were challenged IP with ID8-luc tumor. Treatment was initiated 3 days later using a higher dose as ID8 is less sensitive to Up284 than ES2 (Fig 1B). The mice were administered IP either 20 mg/kg Up284 in 25% \u03b2-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin in water, or vehicle alone, for 4 weeks every third day, and tumor growth was monitored using bioluminescent imaging. On day 15, the Up284-treated mice showed a significantly lower tumor burden (p = 0.0001) (Fig 6G and 6H). Furthermore, Up284 treatment significantly enhanced survival (p = 0.0004) in these immunocompetent mice.\nSpontaneous Genetically-Engineered Mouse Model (GEMM) of primary peritoneal/ovarian cancer\nGEMM better mimic the spontaneous development of cancers in an immune competent host than transplantable tumor lines. Twenty female C57BL/6 mice were co-injected IP with sleeping beauty vector and plasmids expressing carrying shp53, AKT, c-Myc and firefly luciferase genes, followed by electroporation (EP) to deliver these plasmid DNA into the peritoneal cavity cells wherein they integrate randomly into their genome [32]. After 7 days mice were imaged by IVIS for bioluminescence and randomized. Groups (n = 10) were treated IP with vehicle or Up284 (20mg/kg) every 3 days for 6 weeks. Up284 significantly reduced tumor burden (p = 0.002) and showed a trend for prolonged survival compared to vehicle treated group (p = 0.06) (Fig 6D\u20136F). The vehicle treated group produced copious ascites and solid tumor, whereas the Up284 treated mice did not develop appreciable ascites and solid tumor burden was obviously lower upon dissection.\nE) Up284 pharmacokinetics. Male CD1 mice (n = 4) were treated with Up284 IV (5mg/kg), IP (20mg/kg) or PO (50mg/kg). Blood was collected at indicated time points thereafter and analyzed for Up284 levels by HPLC.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221.g005\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 20 / 29\nComparison of Up284 inhibition of proteasome function in healthy solid tissue and tumor\nTo investigate the Up284 activity in normal as compared to tumor tissue, a pilot experiment was performed in female nude mice.

After 48 h, the mice were injected with luciferin, imaged and then randomized into 3 groups (n = 5/group). Next, leg muscle of each mouse was electroporated with 4UbFL plasmid (considered as normal tissue). After 48 h (i.e. day 4) the mice were re-imaged and basal bioluminescence (0 h) was separately measured in the leg muscle and peritoneal ROIs. The mice were then treated with a single IP dose of either vehicle, Up284 (20mg/kg) or bortezomib (0.75 mg/kg) and imaged again at 4 h and 24 h, and the bioluminescence signal normalized to that at 0 h for normal (leg) and tumor sites respectively. Up284 and bortezomib similarly enhanced the bioluminescence signal in muscle tissue, which trended higher than for tumor tissue, but did not reach significance (Fig 6I)."

            "text": "We developed a series of novel spirocyclic chemical scaffolds that bind to RPN13 with higher specificity than the prototype iRPN13, RA190, and other analogs in this bis-benzylidine piperidone series. Up284 appears most promising of this series, although Up285 is slightly more potent due to addition of another warhead, acryloyl, to the central spiro ring\u2019s nitrogen. Use of nitrile electron withdrawing groups on the outer rings of the spirocyclic scaffold instead of nitro groups appears both to limit off-target effects due to the restriction of the spiro carbon atom, and to enhance potency [50, 51].\nUp284 is more drug-like than RA190 and other analogs in this bis-benzylidine piperidone series as it lacks their PAINS structure and is more soluble. Up284 is well tolerated by mice at therapeutic doses with favorable PK/PD parameters when administered IP or IV, and it has potential even for oral administration. Although IP delivery of chemotherapy is most effective for ovarian cancer, it is less commonly used than IV administration [52]. When administered IP, Up284 provided significant treatment benefit against an orthotopic human ovarian cancer xenograft model, as well as syngeneic, and spontaneous genetically engineered mouse models. One possible reason that bortezomib is not effective for treatment of solid cancers is lack of access due to its peptide-based backbone. Indeed, more promising treatment effects were evident when bortezomib was administered IP to ovarian cancer patients [53] as compared to IV. Up284 has a very different scaffold. However, both agents effectively inhibited proteasome function in muscle and in ES2 ovarian cancer xenografts at 5 days post implantation (Fig 6I). This suggests that both Up284 and bortezomib readily access solid tumor. However, the tumor size is presumably small at only day 5 post-implantation as compared to much larger tumor volumes seen in patients, so differences in access to solid tumor might be less apparent in the mouse model.\nUp284 demonstrated similar potency in bortezomib, cisplatin and paclitaxel resistant cell\nlines compared to parental lines cells (Fig 1B). Up284 also synergized with cisplatin in several ovarian cancer cell lines implying that Up284 may warrant testing as an approach to restore platinum-sensitivity in second line treatments. Importantly, Up284 was cytotoxic for cell lines from a variety of other cancer types, notably glioblastoma, MM, triple negative breast cancer, prostate, colon, and HPV-associated cervical cancers (Fig 1B), and efforts to validate these findings in animal models are ongoing.\nAs described with the bis-benzylidine piperidone series of candidate iRPN13, the potent\ncytotoxicity of Up284 is associated with both rapid accumulation of HMW polyUb proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction. This produces ER stress, drops in ATP levels and increased levels of ROS that trigger apoptosis [54]. A similar cytotoxic mechanism has been ascribed to bortezomib, and the emergence of resistance in myeloma has been linked to upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, notably SOD1. MM lines selected for resistance to bortezomib are similarly sensitive to RA190 (and Up284), and this likely reflects ability of RA190 to negate the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 22 / 29\nupregulation of these antioxidant enzymes, including SOD1 [54]. Both bortezomib and iRPN13 is associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Accumulation of ROS resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction can also trigger dissociation of 19S RP from the 20S CP, thereby inhibiting proteasome function [55], and this phenomenon is likewise evident upon treatment with either RA190 or bortezomib [54].\nDespite many similarities, there are significant differences between in the mechanisms of\naction of bortezomib and iRPN13. The iRPN13, like Up284, produce an accumulation of very high MW polyUb proteins (barely running beyond the SDS-PAGE stacking gel) that is absent from cells treated with bortezomib. This suggests that adduction of RPN13 is preventing deubiquitination of the proteasome substrates, a prerequisite to their degradation. Inhibition of deubiquitination may occur by preventing substrate recognition by the 19S RP or/and prevention of RPN13 activation of the proteasomal deubiquitinases (DUB). The proteasomal DUB UCH37 is a logical candidate given its binding to and activation by RPN13, but it is not required for RA190-induced cytotoxicity [56]. A similar phenomenon is seen with b-AP15 and VLX1570 that are reported to inhibit the proteasomal DUBs UCH37 and USP14. However, Up284 did not broadly inhibit cellular DUBs or label proteins of molecular weight consistent with UCH37 or USP14 in tumor cell lysates. Thus, blockade of substrate recognition seems the most likely mechanism. Since bortezomib does not inhibit cellular DUB, this would potentially account for the higher MW of the polyUb protein accumulations seen in iRPN13-treated cells. It is also consistent with their more rapid killing of cells by iRPN13 than bortezomib. Cross-linking of the HMW polyUb protein accumulations by iRPN13 has been proposed, but no labelling was evident in this region in cancer cell lysates exposed to Up284B or RA190B arguing against this mechanism.\nLike RA190 [19, 56\u201358], Up284B binds covalently to recombinant RPN13 in vitro. It also adducts a 42kDa cellular protein in cell lysates, a molecular weight consistent with RPN13. However more definitive studies are warranted to assign the target in live cells [59]. Importantly, evidence of proteasome inhibition by Up284 in muscle and tumor in live animals is provided by the stabilization of 4UbFL (Figs 5B and 5C and 6I). The inhibition of proteasome function in muscle of live mice lasts>48h from a single dose of Up284, suggesting dosing every third day is appropriate. Interestingly, Up284 clears from the bloodstream in 2\u20134 h to a low steady state and accumulates in major organs, notably lung, spleen liver and kidney at 24 h. We speculate that the extended period of 4UbFL stabilization in vivo by a single dose of Up284 may be due to the covalent drug binding as well as the time required by cells to synthesize new functional proteasomes (~24h), a reflection of their size and complexity.\nWhile studies in nude mice show direct anticancer effects of RA190 on the ES2-luc xenograft model, our prior studies revealed that CD8 T cells contribute to its anticancer effect on the ID8-luc syngeneic model in C57BL6 mice [16]. This therapeutic effect was associated with RA190 inhibition MDSC-mediated suppression of CD8 T cell function. Such immunosuppressive mechanisms are particularly problematic in ovarian cancers and may account for the failures of immune checkpoint inhibitors so far in managing this disease. Here we show that RA190 and Up284 treatment can also enhance MHC class I presentation by tumor cells, albeit in a different C57BL6-derived cell line and using the model antigen OVA. This mechanism may contribute to the CD8 T cell dependent effects of RA190 in the ID8-luc model (as this line is relatively resistant to RA190 cytotoxicity as compared to ES2). Interestingly, bortezomib did not enhance antigen presentation in this model. This may reflect that bortezomib inhibits the immunoproteasomes responsible for cleaving proteins to peptides to enable their display by MHC class I. By contrast, the immunoproteasome uses PA28, which lacks RPN13, instead of 19S RP; therefore we speculate that iRPN13 would not inhibit peptide generation and thus antigen-presentation of SIINFEKL peptide derived from the accumulated OVA.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285221 June 14, 2023 23 / 29\nThe induction of antitumor immunity upon bortezomib-induced immunogenic cell death\n(ICD) is a key component of its therapeutic efficacy against MM [49, 60]. RA190 similarly induces surface display of calreticulin, a hallmark of ICD, as for bortezomib. Low concentrations of RA190 promote activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells derived from MM patients and thereby promote MM-specific CTLs and NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against autologous MM cells in vitro [61]. Taken together, these studies suggest the potential of this new iRPN13 Up284 to similarly abrogate immune suppression and restore antitumor immune responses, and the potential for combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors."
