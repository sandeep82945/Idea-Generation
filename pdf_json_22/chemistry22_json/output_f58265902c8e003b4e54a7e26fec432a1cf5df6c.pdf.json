    "abstractText": "Zn(hba)2(tmdp)]n (1), a Zn-coordination polymer (CP), prepared by the reaction of Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O , 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (Hhba) and 4,4\u2019trimethylenedipyridine (tmdp) was reported. The compound was characterised, using CHN, single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction analysis, FT-IR, and TGA techniques. It exhibits a square pyramidal geometry, with the zinc (II) atom coordinated to two nitrogen atoms from two tmdp ligand molecules and to three oxygen atoms from two hba molecules. The zinc (II) carboxylate units are bridged through the N-donor spacer ligand, thereby giving rise to a one-dimensional CP. PXRD analysis confirmed the purity of the bulk of (1). Compound (1) presented an adsorption capacity of 207.8 mg/g for the removal of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) from aqueous solution. The adsorption mechanism is governed by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and electrostatic interactions, as obtained from DFT studies. The feasibility and exothermic nature of the adsorption process is indicated by the negative binding energy obtained.",

The compound was characterised, using CHN, single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction analysis, FT-IR, and TGA techniques. It exhibits a square pyramidal geometry, with the zinc (II) atom coordinated to two nitrogen atoms from two tmdp ligand molecules and to three oxygen atoms from two hba molecules. The zinc (II) carboxylate units are bridged through the N-donor spacer ligand, thereby giving rise to a one-dimensional CP. PXRD analysis confirmed the purity of the bulk of (1). Compound (1) presented an adsorption capacity of 207.8 mg/g for the removal of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) from aqueous solution. The adsorption mechanism is governed by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and electrostatic interactions, as obtained from DFT studies. The feasibility and exothermic nature of the adsorption process is indicated by the negative binding energy obtained.\nKeywords: [Zn(hba)2(tmdp)]n; Coordination polymer; adsorption; DFT studies; trichlorophenol\nl. Introduction\nIn recent years, a class of compounds known as coordination compounds have received a great deal of attention. They are crystalline and their structures are made up of infinite array of metals bridged by organic ligands to form 1D (chains), 2D (sheets) or 3D (frameworks) structures. Their porous counterparts are known as metal organic frameworks (MOFs). They are materials with interesting properties and potential applications like gas and liquid phase adsorption, sensing, photocatalysis, luminescence, drug delivery, antibacterial applications etc.[1\u20137]. Therefore, there is an increased interest on the development of novel CPs suitable for the intended application. More interestingly, their properties can be tuned postsynthetically, by modifying the functionalities, this gives them an edge over previous materials with similar applications [8]. When co- or bridging ligands such as bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,4\u2019- trimethylenedipyridine, imidazole are used as co-ligands alongside carboxylic acids, higher dimensionality and structural diversity of the resulting CP is obtainable as a result of their influence on the assembly process [9]. Several unique structural motifs and desirable functional properties, which cannot be obtained when only one type of ligand is used, can be conferred with the use of these N-donor ligands. Three zinc CPs were constructed with the use of 3,3\u2019- thiodipropionic acid and three different pyridyl ligand [10]. CPs with dimensionalities ranging from 1D chain, 2D layer to 3D framework were obtained with the use of 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane flexible ligands and 1,2-phenylenediacetic acid [11]. Different 5- functionalized isophthalate ligands were used alongside 4,4\u2019- bipyridyl (bpy) and Zn(II) salt, for the synthesis of four CPs, the influence of the different functionalities on the structure of the CPs was investigated [12]. Most recently, we reported two Zn(II) coordination polymers constructed with 4-nitrobenzoate/ 4-biphenylcarboxylate and 4,4\u2019 - trimethylenedipyridine [13].\nThe presence of organic pollutants present in wastewater effluents is an environmental problem of concern, worldwide. They find their way into the ecosystem through natural and anthropogenic activities such as industrial or agricultural activities. Their mutagenic and carcinogenic potentials pose threat and harm to the aquatic environment and even human health [14]. Among these organic compounds are phenolic compounds. Phenols are classified among priority pollutants as a result of their harmful effects on organisms, even when present in concentrations as low as 0.005 mgL -1 [15]. The wide use of phenols and chlorophenols as\nwood preservatives, biocides, and precursors to the manufacture of herbicides, pesticides etc. has led to their abundance in wastewater effluents [16]. In addition, chlorophenols are also produced as by-products of water chlorination and wood bleaching using chlorine in pulp and paper industries [17]. Some of the effects of chlorophenols are chronic bronchitis, coughing and pulmonary defects [18]. The persistent and recalcitrant nature of these compounds has necessitated their remediation. The technologies that have been used for remediation of phenolic compounds are membrane separation [19], ion exchange [20], biodegradation [21], oxidation [22] and adsorption [23]. Adsorption is most preferred due to its low operational cost, ease of operation and the possible reusability of the adsorbents [24]. Reports show that chitosan composites [25], zeolites [26], rattle seed pod [27], clay [28], activated carbon [29] etc. have been used for the adsorption of phenolic compounds from water. A relatively new class of adsorbents are the coordination polymers. They have high surface area and pore volume, high chemical stability, tunable properties and structures capable of strong interaction with target adsorbate through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction and so on [30]. All these lead to the exhibition of high adsorption efficiency, high selectivity for the target molecule and satisfactory reusability for several adsorption cycles, thereby making them cost-effective [8]. There are several reports on the effective use of coordination polymers for the adsorption of phenolic compounds [31\u201335]. Our group previously reported the use of coordination polymers for environmental remediation [13,36\u201339]. This work also reports the efficiency of the Zn (II) CP in the adsorption of 2,4,6- trichlorophenol (TCP) (Figure 1) solution which is a representative organic compounds found in industrial effluents, especially pulp and paper industries. In addition, specific interactions that aided the adsorption of TCP were analysed. It is noteworthy that, to the best of our knowledge, no study in the use of CPs for the removal of TCP has been reported.\nCl\nCl\nCl\nOH\nFigure 1: Structure of 2,4,6 -Trichlorophenol (TCP)"

The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization functional was applied with Grimme for DFT-D correction. Density functional semi-core pseudopotentials were fitted to all electrons with a double numerical plus (DNP) polarization basis set and a real-space orbital global cut-off of 4.4 \u00c5. The studies were first carried out in gas phase before the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) was applied using water at a dielectric constant of 78.54. The sum of the energies of the adsorbent and adsorbate was subtracted from the total energy of the adsorbent/adsorbate dye cluster, to give the binding energies between the adsorbent and adsorbate (Equation S3)."

This band disappeared in the spectrum of (1) indicating its involvement in the coordination with Zn(II) ion. The stretching frequencies of phenolic O-H and C-OH are at 3200 and 1250 cm -1 respectively. The latter was not affected by the complexation, indicating that the phenolic OH did not coordinate to the metal [45]. Moreover, the C=O band of the ligand at 1720 cm -1 disappeared in the spectrum of (1), indicating that the carboxylate oxygen coordinated to the metal ion. \u03bd(C=N) band was situated at 1585 cm -1 for tmdp, and was shifted to 1543 cm -1 on compound (1) spectrum.

The last two weight loss steps, each of 24% (calc. 25.46%), correspond to the loss both hba molecules: the first being in the range 260-300\u00b0C and the second in the range 454-510\u00b0C. 14% (calc.15.05%) of zinc oxide residue is seen to be stable up to 800\u00b0C. PXRD pattern of the product formed after the TGA analysis was obtained to confirm it was ZnO, as shown in Figure S3. The pattern was found to match that of zincite in the database (JCPDS No. 00-036-1451) [47]. The hkl values were included."

            "text": "Compound [Zn(hba)2(tmdp)]n (1) is built up of two p-hba and two tmdp molecules in a fivecoordinate manner. It crystallizes in an orthorhombic system with space group F d d 2. The structure is shown in Figure 3. Crystal data and data collection summary are shown on Table S1. The asymmetric unit is composed of a Zn (II) atom, two hba molecules and one tmdp molecule. There are two coordination modes of the p-hba ligand. One of the p-hba ligands coordinates monodentately with one carboxylate oxygen O16 while the second coordinates in a bidentate chelating mode with both carboxylate oxygen atoms O24 and O25. Atoms O16, O24, N3 and N13 reside at the corners of the basal plane, whereas the apical position is occupied by O25. However, the distance between O17 and Zn1 is 2.74 \u00c5. This is considerably longer that the short Zn-O and Zn-N distances that define the coordination sphere and in fact more distant than carbon atoms, so cannot be considered a bonding distance. The square pyramidal geometry of the structure is slightly distorted, ascertained by the geometry index, \u03c4 of 0.041 (\u03c4 is 0 for a perfect square pyramidal and 1 for a perfect trigonal-bipyramidal geometry) [48]. The \u03c4 value of 0.041 indicates the deviation from perfect square pyradimal geometry. The significant deviation of the O-Zn-N from 90 o also supports this. Bond distances and angles around the metal ion are shown in Table 1. Two adjacent Zn(II) atoms are linked by the tmdp ligand to form 1D CPs, with the two carboxylate ligand molecules acting as pendants as shown in Figures S4.\nThe shortest bond distance between two zinc (II) centres is 9.440 \u00c5. The bond distance of Zn1-N3 and Zn1-N13 are almost the same, around 2.0723 \u00c5 and compares favourably with those in literature [49\u201351] but the Zn-O bond distances range from 1.9574 to 2.4847 \u00c5. Zn1O24 and Zn1-O25 bond lengths are longer than Zn1-O16, this indicates a weaker ligand coordination ability of the chelating carboxylate than the monodentately coordinated carboxylate [52]. The similar bond lengths of C25-O24 (1.280 \u00c5) and C25-O25 (1.230 \u00c5) indicates that the bonding arrangement is delocalized, rather than localized single and double bonds. The methylene groups between the two pyridyl rings of tmdp ligand confer flexibility on it. The flexibility is confirmed by the significant dihedral angle of 179 o between the planes of the two pyridyl rings. The plane of the carboxylic group of the hba ligand and that of the aromatic ring are far from being coplanar, as seen from the dihedral angle of 14.95 o [53]. Figure S5 shows that there are O-H\u2026O intermolecular hydrogen bonds present, firstly between the free hydroxyl oxygen (O29) and a chelated oxygen atom (O25) of hba from adjacent structural units; and secondly between the free hydroxyl oxygen of another hba (O21) and the uncoordinated oxygen atom (O17) from adjacent structural units (Table 2). The compound is packed in a rib-like manner and the hydrogen bonds stabilize the supramolecular networks (Figure S6). The packing view of the unit cells for 1 is shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 3.

The lower adsorption capacity of [Zn(biphen)2(tmdp)]n than that of (1) could be attributed to the steric hindrance caused by the bulky nature of the biphen moieties intercalated into the voids created from its packing, as shown in Figure S7. This justifies the void volume of the channels of (1) and [Zn(biphen)2(tmdp)]n calculated using PLATON (1295.93 \u00c5 3 and 141.00 \u00c5 3 respectively.

Using the equation, it was determined that as the pH increases, the fraction of the unionized species of TCP reduces and that of the ionized species increases. The pHpzc for (1) was found to be 7.5 (Figure S8). In the pH range 2-6, as shown in Figure 6, the adsorption capacity of (1) for TCP was almost constant but the highest adsorption efficiency was observed at pH 6 (202 mg/g). Moreover, at higher pH, the surface of (1) is negatively charged resulting in reduced\nelectrostatic repulsion between negatively charged surface of (1) and ionised TCP species [55] and ultimately reduced adsorption. Adsorption of a certain amount of TCP was still possible in the basic condition, indicating that other mechanisms apart from electrostatic interaction might have taken effect.\nFigure 6: Effect of pH on the adsorption of TCP on (1)\nVarious amounts of (1) (0.01 to 0.05 g) were used for the adsorption process to investigate the maximum uptake with 50 mL of 100 mg/L of TCP. From Figure S9, the adsorbent dosage with the maximum adsorption capacity is 0.03 g. Therefore, 0.03 g adsorbent dosage was taken as the optimum. The experiments were performed in the range 298 \u2013 333 K for the optimization of the solution temperature (Figure S10a). Maximum adsorption capacities for TCP by (1) was obtained at 298 K but dropped when the temperature was increased. This indicates the exothermic nature of the adsorption processes.

After the adsorption of TCP, the breadth of the phenolic O-H seen around 3200 cm \u22121 band changed (as shown with the oval shapes) and also, its center was shifted, indicating the interactions between the phenolic O-H groups of (1) and TCP. The intensity of the \u2013COO - peak at 1543 cm \u22121 changed after adsorption of TCP showing that it was involved in the adsorption of TCP. Other information from the comparison of the IR spectra is the presence of new bands at 1220 and 704 cm \u22121 on (1)-TCP which is absent on (1) and can be related to the phenolic C-O and C\u2015Cl stretching vibration of TCP, respectively. In like manner, new bands seen around 1431-1461 cm \u22121 on (1)-TCP are attributed to the deformation vibration of hydroxyl groups and the vibrations of C\u2015H [56]. In addition, it is believed that the pi-pi stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of TCP and (1) can also be beneficial to the adsorption of TCP. This was suggested for the adsorption of 2,4- dichlorophenol and the imidazolium ring of cyclodextrin-ionic liquid polymer [64].

Pre-optimization of the structures was done using Biovia Forcite. The effect of pH in the adsorption of TCP on (1) was studied theoretically by modelling the ionized forms of the starting materials and the clusters under the same conditions. Binding energies were also calculated. The neutral model of TCP was more stable based on the SCF and binding energies (Table 5 and Figure 10). The total energies of possible starting positions in the interaction of (1) and TCP were calculated and it was deduced that the lowest energies were possessed by the clusters where the TCP molecules presented pi-pi interactions with the aromatic rings (4-hydroxybenzoic\nacid of CP and -OH of TCP pointing towards the Zn centre. The study clearly showed that dispersion forces, particularly pi-pi interactions, electron donating properties of \u2013OH play pivotal roles, thus responsible for CP and TCP interactions.\nThe \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between the phenolic compound and the adsorbent, which is said to have contributed to the adsorption process, has been reported for the adsorption of other phenolic compounds by different adsorbents."

Such factors include the need for input of heat energy and the regeneration of the spent adsorbent. From the study of the effect of temperature on the adsorption process, compound (1) was found to give the maximum adsorption capacity at ambient temperature, there was no need for the application of heat\nenergy to maximise the adsorption capacity.
