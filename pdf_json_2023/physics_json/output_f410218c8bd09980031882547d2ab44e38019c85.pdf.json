    "abstractText": "Attractive technology for producing sustainable hydrogen with water electrolyzers was foreseen as one of the most promising ways to meet the increasing demands of renewable resources and electricity storage. Mainly used for the efficient generation of H2, water electrolysis involving hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) depends on efficient and affordable electrocatalysts. Hydrogen is an effective fuel that can be produced by splitting water. Hence, the search for highly efficient HER catalysts is a major challenge as efficient hydrogen evolution catalysts are sought to replace catalysts such as platinum. Here, we describe a low-cost and highly effective electrocatalyst for the proper incorporation of the HER electrocatalyst with low overpotential, effective charge transfer kinetics, low Tafel slope, and good durability. By using a simple hydrothermal approach to produce Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/ CNF, it is possible to attach Co3(PO4)2.8H2O to the surface of carbon nanofibers (CNFs), which also exhibit remarkable HER activity at an overpotential of 133mV and produce a current density of 10mA/cm and a 48mV/decade for the Tafel slope. Large electrochemical surface areas and easy charge transfer from Co3(PO4)2.8H2O to the electrode through conductive Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF composites are the reasons for the improved performance of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF.",

Mainly used for the efficient generation of H2, water electrolysis involving hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) depends on efficient and affordable electrocatalysts. Hydrogen is an effective fuel that can be produced by splitting water. Hence, the search for highly efficient HER catalysts is a major challenge as efficient hydrogen evolution catalysts are sought to replace catalysts such as platinum. Here, we describe a low-cost and highly effective electrocatalyst for the proper incorporation of the HER electrocatalyst with low overpotential, effective charge transfer kinetics, low Tafel slope, and good durability. By using a simple hydrothermal approach to produce Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/ CNF, it is possible to attach Co3(PO4)2.8H2O to the surface of carbon nanofibers (CNFs), which also exhibit remarkable HER activity at an overpotential of 133mV and produce a current density of 10mA/cm2 and a 48mV/decade for the Tafel slope. Large electrochemical surface areas and easy charge transfer from Co3(PO4)2.8H2O to the electrode through conductive Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF composites are the reasons for the improved performance of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF.\nKEYWORDS\nwater splitting, composite, carbon nanofibers, cobalt phosphate, HER\nIntroduction\nThe energy crisis, environmental degradation, and global warming\u2014all driven by the extensive use of fossil fuels\u2014have motivated the production of clean and renewable energy. Currently, due to the accelerating spread of the global energy crisis and the ongoing decay of traditional fossil fuels, a clean, high-energy-density hydrogen economy derived from renewable sources is being extensively studied and developed (Zou and Zhang, 2015). The H2 evolution reaction (HER) critically depends on appropriate electrocatalysts such as platinum (Pt) and its alloys, which catalyze the conversion of pairs of protons and electrons to H2 at high reaction rates with low overpotentials. However, the high price and relative scarcity of Pt severely limits its widespread use. Therefore, finding reliable and effective alternative catalysts that are geologically abundant is imperative for the future of the hydrogen economy (Gao et al., 2015). The development of an inexpensive HER electrocatalyst, using base elements with superior activity and high stability as a replacement for expensive platinum, has been one of themost pressing goals"

In recent decades, several studies have been conducted to replace noble-metal-based electrocatalysts (Bui et al., 2020).\nBecause of its ability to catalyze the splitting of water, cobalt (Co) has become an intriguing base metal. The preparation of Co-based composites and complexes using homogeneous molecular catalysts has received much research attention (Anjum et al., 2018; Ahmed et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2021a; Singh et al., 2022a; Singh et al., 2022b). In addition, cobalt-based electrocatalysts (CoP, Co3O4, CoOOH, CoSe2, etc.) have attracted significant attention for a variety of applications, including sensors (Hu et al., 2021b; Sari et al., 2022), supercapacitors (Rovetta et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018), lithium-ion batteries (Khan et al., 2016), and OER (Sun et al., 2021; Biswas et al., 2022; Kubba et al., 2022). Because of their strong electrochemical activity, cobalt phosphates have attracted much attention in recent decades and have been used extensively in electrochemical energy storage and as electrocatalysts for water splitting (Shu et al., 2018; Majhi and Yadav, 2021a). An inductive influence due to the presence of (PO4)3 groups means that the redox coupling of the transition metal is significantly higher than that of the comparable oxide. In addition, the excellent ionic conductivity of the large (PO4)3 units creates open pathways that can facilitate rapid ionic migration (Samal et al., 2016). Carbon-based materials (carbon nanofibers and carbon nanotubes) have attracted significant interest in an attempt to improve the long-term stability of the catalysts, while transition metal oxides (Zhao et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019; Ahmed et al., 2021; Majhi and Yadav, 2021b), sulfides (Biswas et al., 2021; Majhi and Yadav, 2021c; Sun et al., 2021), and phosphates (Ahmed et al., 2022; Majhi and Yadav, 2022a; Majhi and Yadav, 2022b) of other transition metals have been used as binding and support materials due to their excellent corrosion resistance, good conductivity, and adjustable chemical surface properties. Carbonbased materials have received significant attention due to their adaptable surface chemistry, strong conductivity, and excellent corrosion resistance. Therefore, to achieve highly efficient overall water splitting to produce clean H2, a rational design of electrocatalysts is required. This must account for processing costs, catalytic activity, and long-term stability (Woo et al., 2020).\nIn this work, we synthesized a hydrated phosphate-based carbon-nanofiber-supported material (Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNFs) to\nstudy the HER performance of the catalyst in acidic media. Hydrated cobalt phosphate with carbon nanofibers has shown excellent stability over 24 h, implying its superior stability during the HER reaction. The composite helps increase the highly electroactive surface area, high conductivity, and vertical growth relative conducting CNFs, exposing a high density of edge phosphate. Other factors that increase the activity of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNFs are high current density, low Tafel slope, and low charge transfer resistance, which are 133 mV, 48 dec/cm1, and 43.04, respectively. The developed catalyst showed electrocatalytic performance comparable to commercial Pt/C in the acidic HER medium."

The XRD pattern of the hydrothermal synthesized (Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF) catalyst is intact and well-matched with the ICSD card no: 00-033-0432 of hydrated cobalt phosphate, and most prominent broad diffraction peaks assigned to the (002) plane of CNF at the 2\u03b8 position of 26.35\u00b0 are present (Figure 1A). This outcome primarily suggests the presence of hydrate molecules in the hydrothermally synthesized Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF catalyst. The XRD pattern exhibited dominant peaks at 2\u03b8 with values of 11.26\u00b0, 13.26\u00b0, 18.28\u00b0, 19.62\u00b0, 21.97\u00b0, 23.19\u00b0, 27.97\u00b0, 30.31\u00b0, 33.17\u00b0, 33.36\u00b0, 35.67\u00b0, 37.31\u00b0, 40.79\u00b0, and 41.53\u00b0, corresponding to the lattice planes of (110), (0 2 0), (2 0 0),\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org02\n(\u22121 0 1), (1 3 0), (1 0 1), (0 3 1), (2 1 1), (\u22123 2 1), (\u22121 4 1), (1 4 1), (3 0 1), (\u22123 4 1), and (\u22122 5 1), respectively. The diffraction patterns of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O (Figure 1B) indexed well with the monoclinic phase 12/m space group standard patterns, and no other peaks\nwere detected in the XRD patterns. However, the XRD pattern of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF (Figure 1C) showed peaks corresponding to both Co3(PO4)2.8H2O and CNF, indicating the formation of a Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF hybrid structure. The observed peaks had high intensities, clearly showing that the as-prepared samples were highly crystalline. No other impurities were found. The levels of the high-intensity peaks are highlighted in the composite spectra.\nFurthermore, for comprehensive conclusiveness, we performed the Rietveld refinement of the PXRD pattern of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/ CNF (Figure 2) by FullProf Suite software. The crystal structure was generated using a refined CIF file in VESTA software. As shown by the atomic positions given in Supplementary Table S2, we clearly identified the presence of hydrogen atoms along with the copper, phosphorus, and oxygen atoms. These hydrogen atoms came from the H2O molecules conjugated with the Co3(PO4)2 lattice. Now, the Co3(PO4)2.8H2O lattice crystallizes into a 2D monoclinic structure with the space group C12/m 1. It is composed of two Co3P2(OH)16 sheets with preferential orientation in the (0 1 0) direction. Among the two inequivalent Co2\u207a sites, the first site (corresponding to the Co1 atom at the 2a Wyckoff site) is bonded to six O2\u207b atoms in the CoO\u2086 octahedron, which shares corners with the two equivalent PO\u2084 tetrahedra. There are two shorter (2.0624 \u00c5) and four longer (2.1646 \u00c5) Co\u2013O bond lengths. At the second Co2\u207a site (corresponding to the Co2 atom at the 4g Wyckoff site), Co\n2\u207a is bonded to six O2\u207b atoms to form a CoO\u2086 octahedron that shares corners with four equivalent PO\u2084 tetrahedra and an edge with one CoO\u2086 octahedron.

P\u2075\u207a is bonded to four O2\u207b atoms to occupy the PO\u2084 tetrahedral site that shares corners with five CoO\u2086 octahedra. The P\u2013O bond distances range from 1.5529 to 1.5910 \u00c5. There are five inequivalent O2\u207b sites; among them, at the first O2\u207b site (corresponding to the O1 atom), O2\u207b is bonded in a ninecoordinate geometry to one Co2\u207a and eight H1\u207a atoms (3 H1, 3 H2, H3, and H4). At the second O2\u207b site (corresponding to the O2 atom), O2\u207b is bonded in a six-coordinate geometry to one Co2\u207a atom and five H1\u207a atoms (2 H1, 2 H3, and H4). At the third O2\u207b site (corresponding to the O3 atom), O2\u207b is bonded in a four-coordinate geometry to one Co2\u207a, one P\u2075\u207a, and two equivalent H1\u207a atoms (H3 and H4). At the fourth O2\u207b site (corresponding to the O4 atom), O2\u207b is bonded in a three-coordinate geometry to two equivalent Co2\u207a atoms and one P\u2075\u207a atom. At the fifth O2\u207b site (corresponding to the O5 atom), O2\u207b is bonded in a sixcoordinate geometry to one Co2\u207a, one P\u2075\u207a, and four equivalent H1\u207a atoms (H2). Among the four inequivalent H1\u207a sites, at the first H1\u207a site (corresponding to the H1 atom), H1\u207a is bonded in a fivecoordinate single-bond geometry to five O2\u207b atoms (3 O1 and 2 O2), with a shorter H\u2013O bond length of 0.8835 \u00c5 (O2) and a longer H\u2013O bond length of 2.8099 \u00c5 (O1). At the second H1\u207a site (corresponding to the H2 atom), H1\u207a is bonded in a five-coordinate single-bond geometry to five O2\u207b atoms (3 O1 and 2 O5), with a shorter H\u2013O bond length of 0.9470 \u00c5 (O1) and a longer H\u2013O bond length of 2.6647 \u00c5 (O5). At the third H1\u207a site (corresponding to the H3 atom), H1\u207a is bonded in a four-coordinate single-bond geometry to four O2\u207b atoms (O1, 2 O2, and 2 O3), with a shorter H\u2013O bond length of 0.8675 \u00c5 (O2) and a longer H\u2013O bond length of 2.8224 \u00c5 (O1). At the fourth H1\u207a site (corresponding to the H4 atom), H1\u207a is bonded in a three-coordinate single-bond geometry to three inequivalent O2\u207b atoms (O1, O2, and O3) with H\u2013O bond lengths of 0.6671 \u00c5 (O1), 2.7845 \u00c5 (O1), and 2.1287 \u00c5 (O5). Thus, we can conclude from the crystal structure symmetry that the Co3(PO4)2 phase contains water molecules in the Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF composite system as we synthesized it in hydrothermal treatment and because at low temperature, the Co3(PO4)2 phase is stable in its ortho-hydrate due to its thermodynamical preferences.\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis\nare presented in Figure 3. The FTIR spectrum (Figure 3A) demonstrates that the stretching of the P\u2013O\u2013P linkages is attributed to the peaks at 714 cm\u22121 and 855 cm\u22121 and shows the vibrational mode of PO4\n3-. The strong absorption asymmetric vibration mode of the PO4 group was observed at 1027 cm\n\u22121. The characteristic band at 1611 cm\u22121 represents the bending vibration mode of a water molecule (H\u2013O\u2013H). Adsorbed water is represented by a broad absorption band from 3051 to 3448 cm\u22121 and can be assigned to the vibrational bond of O\u2013H. These results indicate that the deposited material contains structural water and formation of hydrous cobalt phosphate (Co3(PO4)2.8H2O)/CNF.\nAt higher temperatures and treatment in an inert atmosphere, the cobalt cation and the phosphate anion reinstall a crystal structure. The removal of coordinated water molecules is also confirmed by thermal derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) and gravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Figure 3B. The thermogram of the Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF material exhibits two distinct loss stages. The first step shows the initial 4.8% weight loss in the temperature range of 105 \u00b0C; in the second stage, a 19.3% weight loss is observed in the temperature range of 106\u00b0C\u2013153 C due to the loss of water. The total weight loss of the sample was found to be 46.2% when the temperature was up to 700\u00b0C.\nField emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM)\nThe surface morphology of the Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF material was observed by FE-SEM. Typical FE-SEM images of a synthesized sample are shown in Figure 4. The FE-SEM image of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O shows a rod-shaped flower (Figure 4A) and resembles CNF with a thread-like morphology (Figure 4B). The Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF composite shows that cobalt phosphate flowers are stacked with a uniform and regular structure on the surface of carbon nanofibers; images of the composite are shown in Figures 4C, D. It can be observed that the surface morphology of cobalt phosphate is a tightly packed flower, which may suggest support for effective electron transport. In addition, the elemental color map of the Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF composite is shown in\nFIGURE 3 (A) FTIR analysis, and (B) TGA (blue, left axis) and DTG (red, right axis) analysis of Co3(PO4)2\u00b78H2O.\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org04\nFigures 5A\u2013E, where it can be observed that the distribution of Co, O, P, and C is suboptimal, resulting in the exposed substrate observed in these pictures.

The charge transfer resistances of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF composite catalysts, Co3(PO4)2.8H2O, and CNF were 43.04 \u03a9, 84.12 \u03a9, and 136.19 \u03a9, respectively, with the Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF composite having the lowest value compared to the other catalysts, indicating its fast kinetic process in HER activity. Mass loading of 0.707 mg/cm2 was introduced onto the prepared Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF electrode\nFIGURE 7 (A) Polarization curve (LSV) plot and (B) corresponding Tafel plot of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF, Co3(PO4)2.8H2O, and CNF, and Pt/C.

For deep understanding of the influence of cobalt phosphate nano fibers (Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF) we have also determine the mass activity (MA) of catalysts by mass loading (presented in Figure 8B) at an overvoltage of 133 mV. Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF has the highest mass activity of 169.30 A g\u22121, compared to its counterparts Co3(PO4)2.8H2O (119.34 A g\n\u22121) and CNF (42.00 A g-1). Mass activity was calculated using the following equation:\nMass activity Ag\u22121( ) j A cm \u22122( )\nm g cm\u22122( ) . (1)\nThe HER process proceeds through three principal steps, called the Volmer, Heyrovsky, and Tafel steps, in the acidic medium (Pentland et al., 1957; Conway and Tilak, 2002; Xie et al., 2013; Basu et al., 2017). The Volmer reaction is associated with proton absorption, which is a primary discharge step (Step 1). The Heyrovsky step is the electrochemical desorption stage (i.e., the combination of a second proton with an absorbed H atom of H2 gas) (Step 2). The Tafel step is a recombination step\n(i.e., the combination of two nearby absorbed H atoms to produce H2 gas) (Step 3).\nH3O + + e\u2212 +M \u2192 M \u2212Hads +H2O step 1( )\nM \u2212Hads +H3O+ + e\u2212 \u2192 M +H2 +H2O step 2( ) M \u2212Hads +M \u2212Hads \u2192 M +H2 step 3( )\nwhere Hads represents a hydrogen atom chemically adsorbed on an active site of the catalyst surface (M). If the Volmer reaction is the rate-determining step, then the Tafel slope should be 120 mV dec\u22121, and for the Heyrovsky process and Tafel process, Tafel slopes of 40 and 30 mV dec\u22121 should be obtained, respectively (Xie et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2016). Therefore, combinations of steps (i.e., the Volmer\u2013Heyrovsky or Volmer\u2013Tafel pathways) are required to produce molecular hydrogen in a complete HER process.\nIn addition, the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) performed at different sampling rates, from 10\u201350mV s\u22121 (Figure 9A). Cdl was estimated by measuring voltammograms in a non-Faradic region, and Cdl was measured to determine the origin of the high HER activity of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF\nFIGURE 8 (A) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots and (B) mass activity of the catalysts.\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org08\ncomposite nanostructures. Both the anodic and cathodic double-layer charging currents (Ja and Jc, respectively) were calculated, and the values were plotted against the corresponding sample rates. Thus, the calculated Cdl for theCo3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF composite is shown in Figure 9B and is 3.072 mF cm\u22122; the corresponding ECSA is 76.97 cm2, and 1.66/41.7 and 0.83/20.96 for the Co3(PO4)2.8H2O and CNF catalysts Cdl/ECSA, respectively (Supplementary Figures S1C, D and Table 1). The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) study shows that Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/ CNF has the highest surface area of 37.6 m2 g\u22121 compared to other constituents Co3(PO4)2.8H2O (28.2 m\n2 g\u22121) and CNF (21.4 m2 g\u22121); the results for these constituents are displayed in Supplementary Figure S2. The catalyst possesses excellent durability and stability after 20 h, without apparent chemical or structural deformation; XRD and FE-SEM after stability measurements are presented (Supplementary Figure S3)."

The structural characterizations confirmed the formation of Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF with a flower-like structure attached over carbon nanofibers. The synthesized catalyst Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF shows excellent performance for HERwith the low overpotential (133 mV) required to generate current densities of 10 mA cm\u22122, a small Tafel slope (48 mV decade\u22121), and good stability at 24 h. The composite helps increase the high electroactive surface area, high conductivity, and vertical growth over conductive CNFs, exposing a high density of edge phosphate. This newly developed [Co3(PO4)2.8H2O/CNF] can be considered a promising electrocatalyst for HER in acidic media because of its straightforward synthetic procedure and low cost."
