 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effects of specific probiotic strains on meat protein digestion in older adults. The review discussed how probiotics can improve protein digestion, but more research is needed on which strains are most effective and their mechanisms of action. 

2. Develop optimized protocols for using plant proteases like papain and bromelain to improve meat protein digestibility. The dosage, treatment time, and impact on sensory qualities need further optimization.

3. Study combining physical and chemical methods like sous vide cooking with added proteases to maximize improvements in protein digestion. The synergistic effects of these approaches could be explored. 

4. Evaluate the impact of improving meat protein digestion on muscle synthesis and retention in older adults. Connecting enhanced digestion to clinical outcomes is important. 

5. Conduct human clinical trials on methods to improve meat protein digestion in older adults using appropriate outcome measures. Moving from in vitro studies to human trials is key for translation.
