1. **Investigate the effectiveness of different priming methods for different types of learners.** For example, some learners may respond better to preparatory experience priming (PEP), while others may respond better to context-oriented priming (COP). Research could explore which priming methods are most effective for different learner demographics, learning styles, and academic subjects.


2. **Examine the long-term effects of priming interventions.** Most of the research on priming has focused on the short-term effects of these interventions. However, it is important to know whether the effects of priming interventions last over time. Research could investigate the long-term effects of priming interventions on academic performance, motivation, and mindset.


3. **Develop and evaluate new priming interventions.** The priming interventions that have been studied to date are just a few examples of the many possible priming interventions that could be developed. Research could explore new priming interventions that are based on different theoretical frameworks or that use different technologies.


4. **Investigate the use of priming interventions in different educational settings.** Most of the research on priming interventions has been conducted in laboratory settings. However, it is important to know whether these interventions are also effective in real-world educational settings. Research could investigate the use of priming interventions in K-12 schools, colleges, and universities.


5. **Explore the use of priming interventions to address other educational challenges.** Priming interventions have the potential to address a variety of educational challenges, such as anxiety, stereotype threat, and low motivation. Research could investigate the use of priming interventions to address these challenges and to improve student outcomes.
