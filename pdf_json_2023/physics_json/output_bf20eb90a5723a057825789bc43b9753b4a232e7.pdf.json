    "abstractText": "The genus Coffea is known for the two species C. arabica (CA) and C. canephora (CC), which are used to prepare the beverage coffee. Proper identification of green beans of coffee varieties is based on phenotypic and phytochemical/molecular characteristics. In this work, a combination of chemical (UV/Vis, HPLC-DAD\u2013MS/MS, GC\u2013MS, and GC-FID) and molecular (PCR-RFLP) fingerprinting was used to discriminate commercial green coffee accessions from different geographical origin. The highest content of polyphenols and flavonoids was always found in CC accessions, whereas CA showed lower values. ABTS and FRAP assays showed a significant correlation between phenolic content and antioxidant activity in most CC accessions. We identified 32 different compounds, including 28 flavonoids and four N-containing compounds. The highest contents of caffeine and melatonin were detected in CC accessions, whereas the highest levels of quercetin and kaempferol derivatives were found in CA accessions. Fatty acids of CC accessions were characterized by low levels of linoleic and cis octadecenoic acid and high amounts of elaidic acid and myristic acid. Discrimination of species according to their geographical origin was achieved using highthroughput data analysis, combining all measured parameters. Lastly, PCR-RFLP analysis was instrumental for the identification of recognition markers for the majority of accessions. Using the restriction enzyme AluI on the trnL-trnF region, we clearly discriminated C. canephora from C. arabica, whereas the cleavage performed by the restriction enzymes MseI and XholI on the 5S-rRNA-NTS region produced specific discrimination patterns useful for the correct identification of the different coffee accessions. This work extends our previous studies and provides new information on the complete flavonoid profile, combining high-throughput data with DNA fingerprinting to assess the geographical discrimination of green coffee.",

            "text": "Coffee is one of the world\u2019s most popular beverages, and plants are currently cultivated in about 80 countries on four continents [1,2]. Three main plant species are used for commercial purposes and for coffee production, namely, Coffea arabica L. (also known as Arabica coffee), C. canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner (also known as Robusta coffee), and C. liberica Bull. ex Hiern (also knowns as Liberian/Liberica coffee or Excelsa coffee) [3]. Among these three species, the most commercially important is C. arabica, which accounts for more than 95% of the world\u2019s coffee production [4].\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1135. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12051135 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1135 2 of 24\nSince ancient times, coffee has always attracted consumer interest for its potential effects on cognitive function and pain [5]. The main chemical constituent exerting pharmacological functions is the alkaloid caffeine (which is present from 1.5% to 2.4% w/w depending on the species [1]). However, because coffee records the highest amount of caffeine in comparison to other plant species, it was considered an exclusively recreational beverage, whose intake should be limited to avoid potential adverse effects on human health [6]. On the other hand, recent scientific evidence demonstrated the inconsistency of this claim, ascribing it to specific population groups (i.e., children and adolescents) and even suggesting an increase in its consumption during specific physiological conditions, such as pregnancy and lactation [7]. In addition, it has recently been pointed out that other bioactive compounds are present in coffee in addition to caffeine [8]. Indeed, a variety of chlorogenic acids, which are the most abundant polyphenolic molecules of green coffee [9], hydroxycinnamates (e.g., caffeoylquinic acids, feruloylquinic acids, and p-coumaroylquinic acids) [9\u201313], carbohydrates, and lipid constituents, such as diterpenes and fatty acids (free and esterified), may also be found in coffee beans [14]. These compounds can be extracted using either conventional procedures or microwave, ultrasound, or supercritical CO2 extractions [15]. Coffee processing requires unequivocal identification of both C. arabica and C. canephora accessions, which is currently performed on the basis of coffee bean morphology or by chemical characterization using gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry [16], spectroscopic techniques [17,18], and nuclear magnetic resonance [19,20], with both untargeted fingerprinting (i.e., metabolomics-based discrimination without identifying the metabolites) and targeted chemical profiling (i.e., performed with the identification and quantification of metabolites) [21]. Using chemometric-driven approaches [22], the main metabolites monitored during chemical fingerprinting are mainly bioactive components characteristic of the genus Coffea, with particular reference to organic acids, chlorogenic acids, and caffeine [23]. Furthermore, hyperspectral imaging (1000\u20132500 nm) has been successfully used for the prediction of total lipid content in intact green coffee beans [24]. Storage conditions of green coffee may change the chemical composition, with modification of the chemical profile involving lipids, amino acids, and phenolic compounds [25,26], and the composition of the coffee green beans can be indicative of the sensory quality of the coffee brew [27]. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to use the chemometrics of chlorogenic acids and caffeine to assess the geographical origin of green coffee beans [28]. Discriminant analysis using partial least squares (PLS-DA) was also applied to discriminate genealogical groups of C. arabica [29], and the same methodology was successful when the fatty acid composition of green coffee beans was analyzed for the discrimination of C. arabica from different geographical origin [30]. Despite the undiscussed power of chemometrics, the chemical composition of plants is affected by environmental and/or developmental factors or by the method of sample storage [31], meaning that the same genotype may express different chemical patterns or, conversely, that different genotypes may respond to the same environmental pressure with the same phenotypic expression [32]. By contrast, DNA analysis relies on the presence of molecules with higher stability, and DNA-based methods have become widely employed techniques for a rapid and unequivocal identification of plants [33]. Consequently, an increasing number of gene sequences are now available for DNA barcoding of flowering plants [34]. Recently, we showed that the combination of genomic analysis (using ITS DNA PCR-RFLP) and gene product (phenolic compounds and fatty acids) chemometrics allowed the geographical differentiation of pistachio varieties according to their geographical origin [35]. The aim of this work was to combine DNA fingerprinting, metabolomic chemometrics, and antioxidant assays to obtain the genomic and functional discrimination of green coffee from different geographical origin. In particular, the chemical composition of 20 green coffee commercial accessions of C. arabica and C. conephora was analyzed using both UV/Vis and chromatographic methodologies, while the genomic profile was assessed using DNA\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1135 3 of 24\nPCR-RFLP on 5S-rRNA-NTS and tnrL genomic regions. In our previous work, we analyzed, in the same coffee accessions, the discriminant power of the chlorogenic acids, which represent the most important polyphenols of green coffee [28]. In this work, we extended our search for chemical and molecular markers in green coffee and focused our attention on the flavonoid moiety, because of the scant information in the scientific literature on the flavonoid profile of green bean coffee, and we assessed how it may be affected by variations such as geographic origin, variety, and species. Moreover, the combination of chemical and molecular data, together with the evaluation of antioxidant properties, provides an interesting and high-throughput approach for the unambiguous identification of commercial coffee beans of different geographical origins."

Moreover, a consistent variability in TPC was observed in the CA group. Among the analyzed green coffee beans, the variety Vietnam Unwashed (CC4) had the highest values among all CC accessions, whereas the variety Low Grade from Kenya (CA1) had the highest values among CA accessions. On the other hand, the cultivar Jolly Quartz from Uganda (CC2) and Natural Terraforte from Brasil (CA4) were the varieties with the lowest TPC among CC and CA accessions, respectively. Figure 1 also shows the variation in the radical-scavenging activity and reducing power of green coffee beans. In general, ABTS activity (Figure 1B) was always higher in CC accessions and was associated with the TPC content (Figure 1A), with the sole exception being CC4 (from Uganda) that showed similar values to CA11 (from Guatemala) and CA15 (from Honduras). With regard to FRAP (Figure 1C), the highest activity was found for CC3 (from Kenya); even in this case, it was associated with a high TPC content (Figure 1A). The reduction reaction carried out by the molybdenum and tungsten salts contained in the Folin\u2013Cioc\u00e2lteu reagent used for the TPC analysis is unable to discriminate individual classes of polyphenols or prevent potential interferences from molecules having a phenol linked to the chemical scaffold [42]. Consequently, although this assay has become a common methodology to gain information on the polyphenol content of plant extracts, it turns out to be an assay that leads to overestimated results [48]. Other chemical assays based on selective reactions have been developed to gain more reliable analytical data on the content of specific bioactive compounds, while excluding potential interferences. These include the aluminum complexation assay for the total flavonoid content (TFdC), quantification of total flavonol content (TFlC) [49], and the DMAC assay for the total proanthocyanidin content (TPAC) [50]. As expected, a preliminary search of anthocyanins or anthocyanidins resulted in the complete absence of these compounds. Therefore, the term flavonoids used herein does not include anthocyanins. Therefore, we evaluated the polyphenol content using TFdC, TFlC, and TPAC, as reported in Table 2. In general, the TFdC is in line with the literature data for both C. arabica and C. canpehora accessions [51,52]. Significant (p < 0.05) differences were found among accessions belonging to the two coffee species. In general, CC samples (102.20 \u00b1 22.62 mg RE\u00b7100 g\u22121) showed a twofold higher value in comparison to CA accessions (57.02 \u00b1 27.33 mg RE\u00b7100 g\u22121). In particular, TFdC ranged between 31.23 \u00b1 1.05 (CA9) and 136.11 \u00b1 18.43 (CA1) mg RE\u00b7100 g\u22121 FW. However, the accession with the highest TFdC value was Arabica Low Grade from Kenya (CA1), followed by CC1, CC3, CC2, and CC4. On the other hand, the Brazilian CC5 recorded a TFdC comparable to the accession from Colombia (CA11) and HB ep from Guatemala (CA14). The CC5 accession of C. canephora is also known as caracol (also called peaberry) and has a natural mutation inside its cherry that affects about 5% of the world\u2019s coffee. Its phenotype is characterized by a single, rather than a double bean that appears smaller, denser, and with a more rounded shape with respect to the wildtype [53,54]. Flavonols are a particular class of flavonoids characterized by a 3-hydroxyflavone backbone. Unlike flavanols, such as catechins and proanthocyanidins that are detected by the DMAC assay, a double bond is present between C2 and C3 of the C ring [42]. This particular chemical structure allows the aluminum ion to chelate with the ketone group of the C ring and the hydroxyl of the A ring, resulting in the formation of a green complex [55]. Regarding TFlC, the highest value was found in CA1 from Kenya, while most of the CC accessions showed the highest values, with the exception of CC5 that was discriminated by its low TFlC with respect to all other CA accessions. The flavonol content was in line with previous studies [52].\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1135 9 of 24\nTFdC: total flavonoid content; TFlC: total flavonol content; TPAC: total proanthocyanidin content; RE: rutin equivalent; QE: quercetin equivalent; PACE: proanthocyanidin A2 equivalent.\nConcerning TPAC, a statistical difference in flavan-3-ol content between CC (2.20\u00b1 0.32 mg PACE\u00b7100 g\u22121) and CA (2.01 \u00b1 0.27 mg PACE\u00b7100 g\u22121) accessions was not observed (p > 0.05). However, the cultivar Jolly Quartz from Uganda (CC1) and HB ep from Guatemala (CC10) had the highest values, followed by CC2, CA7, CA9, and CA6. In contrast, the lowest contents were observed for the cultivars Arabika K3 (CA2) and Arabika K2 (CA3), both from Kenya. The data were in line with previous investigations [56,57]. Because TPC, TFdC, TFlC, and TPAC data can be related to the antioxidant properties of a plant extract [58], we evaluated the potential correlation existing between these data and ABTS and FRAP assays. Low values were obtained for TFlC (\u03c1TFlC/ABTS = 0.47; \u03c1TFlC/FRAP = 0.44) and TPAC (\u03c1TPAC/ABTS = 0.22; \u03c1TPAC/FRAP = 0.22), indicating that these molecules probably play a minor role as antioxidants in the analyzed green coffee bean accessions. In contrast, we found a medium correlation between TFdC and ABTS (\u03c1TFdC/ABTS = 0.58) and a higher correlation with FRAP (\u03c1TFdC/FRAP = 0.75). However, the best correlation coefficient was obtained when TPC was compared to ABTS (\u03c1TPC/ABTS = 0.81) and FRAP (\u03c1TPC/FRAP = 0.84). Overall, our correlation analysis strongly suggests that the antioxidant activity of green bean coffee may depend in part on TFdC, but that compounds other than flavonoids most probably contribute to the total antioxidant activity of the extracts, such as chlorogenic acids and alkaloids, including caffeine [28,59]. Using data obtained from spectrophotometric analysis, a principal component analysis (PCA) was calculated using varimax rotation. The PCA explained 50.42% and 25.32% variation by PC1 and PC2, respectively (Figure 2). The sole use of spectrophotometric data allowed the discrimination of four CC species (CC1, CC2, CC3, and CC4) from the CAs, although CA1 failed to separate from the CC group due to its high TFdC value (see also Table 2). In addition, although the caracol variety (CC5, marked in red) diverged from the\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1135 10 of 24\nCC group, it showed a closer fitting with varieties CA4, CA5, CA6, and CA7, which all originate from South America.

Melatonin was also detected in the analyzed samples. This compound does not derive from xanthine and is produced through serial modifications starting from the amino acid tryptophan [64]. Although the theobromine content was unable to discriminate CC and CA accessions, statistical differences (p < 0.05) were observed for the other N-containing compounds, with CC accessions discriminated from CA accessions on the basis of the highest contents of caffeine (17.23 \u00b1 8.60 mg/g), theophylline\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1135 12 of 24\n(0.60 \u00b1 0.04 mg/g), and melatonin (7.71 \u00b1 5.62 \u00b5g/g). In particular, CC2 and CC3 were identified as the variety with the highest amount of caffeine, with a content of almost 22 mg/g, while CC3 and CC4 were the richest in melatonin, accounting for about 9 \u00b5g/g on a FW basis. These data are in agreement with the literature data, confirming the higher content of caffeine in the C. canephora accessions [65,66]. Moreover, although weaker than chlorogenic acid [67], caffeine was found to possess a significant antioxidant capacity [68], which agrees with our antioxidant data. Interestingly, CA4, CA5, CA9, and CA13 (from South and Central America) also had melatonin contents almost comparable to the CC accessions. These results are in agreement with the literature data [69]. Concerning theophylline, CA13 possessed the highest amounts among all CA accessions, and comparable or higher contents with respect to CC samples (see Supplementary Table S1). Even for theophylline, our results are in line with the literature data [70]. Within the 28 compounds belonging to the flavonoid family, 11 were flavonols, along with nine flavanonols, five flavanones, and three flavan-3-ols (Figure 3). Among flavonols, four different aglycones (kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, and isorhamnetin) were detected, along with their glycosides. With the exception of isorhamnetin, all detected flavonols did not have O-methylated substituents at the hydroxyl group of the B ring. Among the flavanols, dihydrokaempferol, taxifolin, and ampelopsin were detected. These aglycones were in most cases conjugated with rutin and to sugar units such as sambubioside, while only one was found to be conjugated to glucose (taxifolin-glucoside) and galactose (taxifolin-galactoside). Regarding flavanones, only naringenin and its conjugates were detected among the analyzed samples. Lasty, catechin, epicatechin, and catechinsambubioside were the flavan-3-ols identified in the coffee accession. We found that CA accessions had kaempferol, quercetin, kaempferol-rhamnoside, hyperoside, kaempferol-sambubioside, kaempferol-rutinoside, and rutin contents 1.5-fold to 2.3-fold higher than CC samples (see Supplementary Table S1). On the other hand, CC samples were characterized by higher levels of taxifolin-galactoside (35.86 \u00b1 3.35 \u00b5g/100 g), taxifolin-glucoside (21.39\u00b1 0.81\u00b5g/100 g), and naringenin-rutinoside (13.47\u00b1 0.19\u00b5g/100 g). All other compounds, although differing within the CC and CA group, were found not to be statistically different between the two species (see Supplementary Table S1). Because chlorogenic acids significantly contribute to the total polyphenol content of green coffee, other polyphenolic compounds have been poorly investigated [71,72]. Here, we provide the flavonoid profile of green bean coffee, and we describe its use in order to discriminate gene coffee geographic origin, variety, and species. Our data are in agreement with Mustafa and coworkers [63], who developed a method for the simultaneous determination of quercetin and glycosidic derivatives in green coffee beans. In addition, the contents of kaempferol and myricetin, along with their respective analogues resulting from the complexation with sugar moieties, evidenced in our analyses are in agreement with recent literature data [73,74]. Using the data reported in Supplementary Table S1, a PCA was calculated with varimax rotation. The PCA explained 36.32% and 33.81% variation by PC1 and PC2, respectively (Figure 4). The chemical quantification of the identified compounds allowed the discrimination of four CC (CC1, CC2, CC3, and CC4) from all other CA accessions. In this case, the caracol variety (CC5, marked in red) also diverged from the CC group, with a closer fitting with varieties CA4, CA5, and CA6, which all originate from South America.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1135 13 of 24Antioxidants 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 26\nFigure 4.

The Fatty Acid Composition and Content Discriminate C. arabica and C. canephora Accessions of Different Geographical Origin\nTo further discriminate the different accessions of the two species, we analyzed the fatty acid profile, because it has been successfully used to discriminate plants species and their origin [35,75\u201377]. With regard to coffee, fatty acids have been successfully used to discriminate the geographic origin of different varieties of C. arabica [78\u201380] and C. canephora [81]. Here, GC-FID and GC\u2013MS analyses were performed on trans-esterified fatty acid samples in order to find additional indicators for green coffee discrimination. The main identified fatty acids were linoleic acid (C18:2) and palmitic acid (C16:0), each accounting for about 39% (w/w) of the total fatty acids, followed by elaidic acid (trans C18:1) and stearic acid (C18:0), which amounted to 8.75% (w/w) and 7.70% (w/w), respectively. Arachidic acid (C20:0) was also present in good percentages, reaching about 4% (w/w) of the total fatty acids, while oleic acid (cis C18:1), behemic acid (C22:0), and myristic acid (C14:0) contributed less than 2% (w/w) together. Our results agree with previous published data on the fatty acid composition of coffee accessions [78,79,81]. In general, CC green coffee beans were characterized by significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of C18:2 and cis C18:1 than CA samples. At the same time, CC beans had the highest amounts of trans C18:1 and C14:0. Quantitative data obtained from GC analyses are reported in Supplementary Table S2, while Figure 5 shows the visualization of the percentage content using a heatmap combined with cluster analysis.

            "heading": "3.5. DNA Fingerprinting Using trnL-trnF and 5S-rRNA-NTS Regions Allows the Molecular Discrimination of Species and Accessions",
            "text": "Plant chemometrics used in our study allowed us to discriminate the two coffee species and to evidence a geographical partitioning. This requires time, and the technology transfer to industrial applications needs fast and cheap technologies. Moreover, the phenotypic plasticity of plants responding to environmental, biotic, and abiotic stresses affects gene expression and product (molecules) formation that may render the metabolomic approach less stable. In this context, DNA analysis is relatively fast, and the presence of molecules with higher stability makes discrimination easier. The genetic method requires genotype rather than phenotype; therefore, DNA-based discrimination has become a widely employed technique for a reliable partitioning of plants [33]. In order to provide a molecular fingerprinting of the coffee accessions, two different primers were used to amplify trnL-trnF and 5S-rRNA-NTS regions of the coffee genome. Regarding trnL-trnF, the size of the amplified fragment was 984 bp for all analyzed accessions. Data from the sequence analyses (deposited in NCBI GenBank with Accession Numbers from OQ779490 to OQ779509) were aligned using CLC software (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) (see Supplementary Figure S5). In general, the consensus sequence showed highly conserved regions (99.19%) in the amplified site, with 0.71% of them being singletons. The trnL-trnF fragments were compared by BLAST alignment to other sequences deposited in GeneBank, and the analysis provided a match almost identical to C. canephora for CC accessions or to C. arabica for CA accessions. Sequences were further analyzed using the neighbor joining (NJ) method to infer the phylogenetic relationship among the green coffee accessions. The phylogenetic tree obtained shows the presence of two main clades: one comprising the caracol variety (CC5, marked in red) and one comprising the C. arabica from Honduras (CA12), which were joined by a low bootstrap score, while another clade gathered all other accessions. In particular, this second clade isolated the remaining C. canephora accessions (CC1, CC2, CC3, and CC4) that formed an independent clade, whose robustness was supported by high bootstrap scores (Figure 8). trnL-trnF encodes for a region composed of the trnL gene, a group of introns, and the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer. Moreover, this region is also characterized by the presence of both conserved elements (which are essential for a correct splicing) and less constrained regions of variable size [82]. Although the number of available markers is gradually increasing, the trnL-trnF region still represents one of the most frequently used molecular markers in plants. Indeed, since its introduction into molecular systematics [83], this region has been considered appropriate for investigations at various taxonomic levels. However, to the best of the knowledge of the authors, the intron has never been used to elucidate relationships between species of the genus Coffea, although the trnL-trnF spacer was successfully used to analyze the evolution of the region in three gymnosperm families [30]. In order to better characterize the coffee accessions, a PCR-RFLP method was applied using AluI as a restriction enzyme to selectively cleave the resulting amplicons. Before enzymatic cleavage, all accessions were found to possess a common trnL-trnF band of 984 bp (Figure 9A). Cleavage by AluI produced in all CC accessions four fragments of 489, 253, 207, and 50 bp, whereas the DNA cleavage of all CA accessions produced fragments of 742, 207, and 50 bp (Figure 9B). Interestingly, the cleavage of the caracol variety (CC5) showed the same bp fragmentation of all other C. canephora accessions, confirming that this mutation belongs to the C. canephora species. Therefore, trnL-trnF-RFLP analysis using AluI has proven to be an efficient molecular strategy to selectively differentiate between C. canephora and the C. arabica species.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1135 17 of 24\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 26\ntwo main clades: one comprising the caracol variety (CC5, marked in red) and one comprising the C. arabica from Honduras (CA12), which were joined by a low bootstrap score, while another clade gathered all other accessions.

It is composed of tandem repeats of alternative arrays of sequences coding 5S-rRNA and non-transcribed spacers (NTSs) located separately from the 18S-26S rRNA gene clusters [45]. Over the years, relevant results have been obtained using RFLP analysis in the 5S-rRNA-NTS region [33,45,85\u201387]. Consequently, to obtain a DNA molecular fingerprinting of the different coffee accessions, the PCR-RFLP method was applied combining MseI and Xhol as restriction enzymes to selectively cleave the resulting amplicons. As expected, gel electrophoresis of the 5S-rRNA-NTS region produced a common band of about 500 bp in all accessions, with the exception of CA1 and CA13, for which a fragment of about 850 bp was observed (Figure 11A). The reason why CA1 and CA13 possess 5S-rRNA fragment sizes was not further investigated. However, it is likely that larger 5S rRNA fragments might be due to genetic or epigenetic differences in their respective 5S-rRNA gene clusters [88]. The combination of the restriction enzymes MseI and XhoI produced selective cleavages on the different accessions (Figure 11B). Specifically, MseI cleavage produced fragments of 445 bp and 50 bp in CC1, CC3, and CC5, whereas XhoI exclusively cleaved CA1 and CA13 5S-rRNA-NTS, producing fragments of 600 and 114 bp. All other accessions were cut at least three times, producing different fragment patterns. A first group consisted of CC2 and CA15 with fragments of 273 and 120 bp. A second group gathered CA2, CA6, CA10, CA12, and CA14, with a cleavage generating fragments of 257, 140, and 50 bp (the latter band consisting of two fragments of 57 and 54 bp; see electropherograms of Supplementary File S2). A third group was made by CC4 along with CA3, CA4, CA5, CA7, CA8, CA9, and CA11, characterized by the production of a fragment of 396 bp and one of 50 bp (in this case resulting from the overlapping of two fragments of 57 and 54 bp) (Figure 11B).\nFigure 10.

On the other hand, MseI and XholI cleavage of 5S-rRNA-NTS produced a pattern of discrimination that can be summarized as follows: (i) a fragment of 445 bp, characteristic for the C. canephora accessions (CC1, CC3, and CC5); (ii) the combined presence of 600 bp and 114 bp, typical of CA1 (Kenya, Arabica low grade) and CA13 (Honduras, Catuahi); (iii) fragments of 257 and 140 bp, exclusive to CA2 (Kenya, Arabica AK3), CA6 (Peru, Jacamar), CA10 (Guatemala, HB ep), CA12 (Honduras, HG ep Margay), and CA14 (Honduras, HG ep Margay) accessions; (iv) bands of 273 bp and 120 bp, distinctive for CC2 (Uganda, Jolly Quartz) and CA15 (Honduras, HG ep Margay); (v) a 396 bp fragment, characterizing all remaining accessions. In conclusion, using a combination of high-throughput metabolomics with phenolic compounds, fatty acids, xanthine derivatives, and melatonin, along with antioxidant power and DNA fingerprinting, we were able to discriminate the two coffee species and partition the individual accessions of the species according to their geographical origin.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antiox12051135/s1: Figure S1.
