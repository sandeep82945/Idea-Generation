    "abstractText": "The development of new substances with the ability to interact with a biological target is only the first stage in the process of the creation of new drugs. The 5-nitroisatin derivatives considered in this study are new inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) intended for anticancer therapy. The research, carried out based on the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) methods, allowed a basic assessment of the physicochemical parameters of the tested drugs to be made. The collected data clearly showed the good oral absorption, membrane permeability, and bioavailability of the tested substances. The analysis of the metabolite activity and toxicity of the tested drugs did not show any critical hazards in terms of the toxicity of the tested substances. The substances\u2019 low solubility in water meant that extended studies tested compounds were required, which helped to select solvents with a high dissolving capacity of the examined substances, such as DMSO or NMP. The use of aqueous binary mixtures based on these two solvents allowed a relatively high solubility with significantly reduced toxicity and environmental index compared to pure solvents to be maintained, which is important in the context of the search for green solvents for pharmaceutical use.",

            "text": "The design of new drugs is not only limited to the search for substances that show pharmacological potential in relation to the chosen biological target, but also requires taking into account other significant properties of potential drugs, such as molecular properties, solubility [1\u20133], absorption [4], metabolism [5], or toxicity [6\u20138], which can significantly affect the practical use of the developed substances. The development of in silico methods allowing these properties to be modelled at a very good level of estimation has contributed to the spread of a significant number of tools that are commonly used in the early phase of drug design, such as ADMETlab2.0 [9], SwissADME [10], pkCSM [11], FAF-Drugs4 [12], and AdmetSAR [13]. Their use allows a significant narrowing of the group of substances considered in in vitro research by excluding chemical compounds with an inappropriate ADMET profile, such as those with properties like the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of considered compounds [4,7,9]. The compounds considered in this work are derivatives of 5-nitroisatin, new inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). The overexpression of CDK2, as well as other enzymes belonging to cyclindependent kinases (CDKs), is closely associated with the development of cancers. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle, as well as in the regulation\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 3019. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11113019 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 3019 2 of 17\nof other enzymes involved in transcription and replication processes [14,15]. Therefore, the development of new inhibitors is crucial in the creation of new effective anti-cancer therapies. The studies carried out so far have allowed a convenient synthesis path to be created, and have shown the significant inhibitory activity of several developed compounds with respect to the active site of the tested enzyme [16]. The further development of the tested compounds as potential drugs requires more knowledge of the physicochemical properties determining their absorption, bioavailability, and toxicity. A significant problem observed in the previous physicochemical analyses is the low solubility of the developed group of inhibitors in water. Solubility plays a vital role both in the theoretical and practical applications of chemical compounds [1,17]. The capacity to dissolve in a specific solvent has substantial effects on the reactivity, stability, and bioavailability of a compound. In the field of pharmaceuticals, solubility holds significant importance in drug design and formulation [2,18\u201320] and is utilized in many stages of the process of drug manufacturing, ranging from extraction to crystallization. In fact, solvents are so crucial in the pharmaceutical industry that it is even estimated that they make up 80\u201390% of the overall volume of chemicals employed in drug manufacturing [3]. Insufficient solubility can impose restrictions on a drug\u2019s effectiveness and bioavailability, resulting in escalated expenses and reduced patient adherence. The processes of synthesis, purification, and separation during drug manufacturing can also be hampered by unsatisfactory solubility. Hence, the establishment of efficient and successful techniques for assessing compound solubility holds immense significance [21\u201324]. Apart from neat solvents, solvent mixtures, particularly with water, are also widely studied. The so-called cosolvation effect occurs when a specific quantity of a secondary solvent is introduced into the primary solvent, resulting in an augmentation of solubility, which in some cases can be quite spectacular [25,26]. If a specific chemical compound is synthesized for the first time, extensive solubility data are usually not available. Consequently, there is a need to perform initial experiments that would guide future considerations regarding the solubility of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). It is also widely accepted that solubility data can be used in theoretical screening procedures which aim to find more efficient solvents by means of different computational methods [27,28]. In this study, several organic solvents were considered for testing the solubility of the studied derivatives. These comprised not only classical organic solvents such as DMSO, DMF, and acetone, but also less popular solvents like 4-formylmorpholine and ethyl lactate. Such a variety of studied solvents is important from the perspective of green chemistry and the search for solvents that are non-toxic, non-flammable, and have a low environmental impact [29\u201332]. Among the studied solvents, even the commonly used DMSO can be considered a green solvent [33]. Also, solvents such as 4-formylmorpholine [34], the three studied glymes [35], lactones [36], cyrene [37] and ethyl lactate [38] are commonly considered green. Apart from neat solvents, for the two best-performing systems, binary solvents were also created by mixing these solvents in varying proportions with water. This was conducted in the hope of achieving an even greater solubility of the studied derivatives, as well as a potential reduction in the volume of the used chemicals. The aim of the presented study was related to obtaining knowledge about the properties of CDK2 inhibitors developed previously [16], which, as it was mentioned earlier, are crucial in creating new forms of drugs. This objective was realized in both a computational manner and by using the ADMET approach, as well as through experimental solubility measurements involving a variety of solvents."

            "text": "The most basic aspects of ADMET analysis, including the values characterizing the physicochemical properties of the considered inhibitors, are presented in Figure 2 and Table 1. The analysis of these outcomes shows that most of the molecular properties of the considered compounds are in the optimal range for pharmaceutical agents. Based on the collected values, it can be unequivocally stated that all analyzed substances meet the basic ADMET rules. In the case of all considered inhibitors, the values of molecular weight,\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 3019 6 of 17\nLogP, and quantities of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors meet the requirements of the Lipinski rule [42], which indicates the potentially good absorption and permeability of these compounds. Meeting the requirements of the Pfizer [43] and the GSK [44] rules suggests that the studied substances will have a convenient ADMET profile and relatively low toxicity. In the case of all considered derivatives of 5-nitroisatin, the obtained LogS values confirm the experimental observations indicating the limited solubility of the tested compounds in water. Low water solubility does not disqualify the considered substances as potential drugs; however, it indicates some challenges associated with the development of a form of the drug that enables its absorption and ensures adequate bioavailability. Such a goal can be achieved by using other solvents used in pharmaceutical products. It will also be important to determine the possibility of creating aqueous binary solvents, which are a mixture of water and organic solvents based on the phenomenon of cosolvation. Crossing the body\u2019s barriers and introducing the drug into the bloodstream will enable the further distribution and metabolism of the drug. The presented values of the LogP and LogS coefficients allow the conclusion that the considered compounds exhibit an appropriate balance between lipophilicity and hydrophobicity, ensuring them the appropriate membrane permeability and binding ability to macromolecules such as active sites of biological targets and enzymes involved in cellular transport or drug metabolism. The potential absorption of the considered inhibitors is also described in terms of the values of the human intestinal absorption (HIA), MDCK permeability, Caco-2 Permeability, and Pgp factors. The values presented in Table 1 show that all considered inhibitors should exhibit high HIA. The probability that HIA will be lower than 30% equals nearly zero for all considered inhibitors. The MDCK permeability is the factor based on the Madin\u2212Darby Canine Kidney cells in vitro model created for the screening of membrane permeability and estimation of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Generally accepted standards for the assessment of these values attribute the high capacity of passive MDCK permeability to compounds described with values greater than 20 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm/s. Therefore, all analyzed derivatives can be assigned to this category. Another descriptor of the passive absorption of drugs in the intestine is a model based on human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (CACO-2) being an adequate equivalent of the intestinal epithelium. This determinant is widely used in the assessment of drug permeability. Compounds characterized by high permeability should have values greater than \u22125.15 log cm/s. In the case of the tested substances, only inhibitor 1 belongs to this category; the other two derivatives are described by values indicating lower permeability. A different method of assessing the permeability of compounds is used in the next two descriptors, namely Pgp-inh and Pgp-sub, based on the functionality of P-glycoproteins, which are part of cell membranes and co-create ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC) [45]. They determine the probability of interaction between the tested drugs and the receptor of the protein in question as an inhibitor or substrate, which may contribute to a significant reduction in the permeability of drugs through membranes. Among the tested 5-nitroisatin derivatives, only in the case of compound 2 was a significant probability of interaction with the above-mentioned receptor as a substrate noted. In the case of drugs that can be administered in an oral form, a significant and frequently used pharmacokinetic parameter is the human oral bioavailability 30% (F (30%)). This value clearly allows the efficiency of introducing the drug into human body fluids to be determined. Values of this descriptor presented in Table 1 describe the probability that oral bioavailability will be smaller than 30%. In the case of all considered inhibitors, the probability of such a situation is equal to zero or nearly zero, which indicates the high oral bioavailability of the considered compounds.\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 3019 7 of 17Bio edicines 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 17\n1\n2\n3\nFigure 2.

One of th most important roles in the regulation of drug metabolism in the human body is play by cytochrome P450 (CYP) nzymes. The CYP 1\u20133 enzyme families are involved in at least 80% of drug oxid tive pro esses and 50% of drug elimination fr m the body, with their most important representatives being Cyp1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 [46,47]. One of the most important factors destabilizing the metabolic processes of drugs regulated by the aforementioned families of enzymes is the phenomenon of inhibition generated by the active forms of drugs and their possible metabolites. An important group of pharmaceuticals with such an ability is agents used in chemotherapy [5,46,47]. This is a frequent source of various types of damage and abnormalities in the functioning of the liver, which is the organ most involved in the discussed drug transformation processes.\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 3019 8 of 17\nThe carried out ADMET analysis makes it possible to predict the potential properties of the group of inhibitors under consideration. The data in Table 2 illustrate the potential activity of the tested substances as inhibitors and substrates for the most important representatives of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. When considering derivative 1, we can see that only in the case of the CYP1A2 enzyme is a significant inhibitory activity of the drug predicted, while in the case of other enzymes, the probability of inhibition is medium or low. The next derivative under consideration, i.e., 2, shows slightly greater inhibitory activity because its increased level is expected for two enzymes from the considered group, namely CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. derivative 3 is characterized by an increased probability of inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme, while in the case of the other considered enzymes, the phenomenon should be negligible. For all considered inhibitors, there is only a medium or very low probability of interaction with the tested group of enzymes as a substrate. Therefore, the tested group of drugs should not significantly interfere with the metabolic processes of other pharmaceuticals metabolized by the analyzed group of enzymes.\nAn important aspect of the study of chemical substances as potential drugs is the analysis of their toxicity in terms of interaction with the human body. The pharmacological\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 3019 9 of 17\naction of a given chemical may be accompanied by a set of undesirable side effects. The studies carried out illustrate a fairly wide spectrum of the potential impact of the tested inhibitors on the human body, and the summary results are presented in Table 3. An important aspect of the potential impact of new drugs is the assessment of their impact on the heart. The determinant of such an impact may be, for example, the ability to block the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium channel. Such drug activity can lead to numerous adverse effects, ranging from cardiac dysfunction to, in extreme cases, a lethal arrhythmia named torsades de pointes (TdP) [48]. The collected data express the probability that the tested substance will exceed the critical value, which is the IC50 for concentrations below 10 \u00b5M or the inhibition constant higher than 50% for the limit concentration. In the case of inhibitors 1 and 2, it can be unequivocally stated that the probability of adverse effects of these substances in this respect is negligible, while in the case of derivative 3, the probability of blocking activity against ion channels is at a moderate level. Another important aspect of adverse drug activity is their hepatotoxicity (H-HT) and the drug-induced liver injuries associated with it [49,50]. For each of the considered drugs, potential activity was found in the context of interfering with drug metabolism processes carried out by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the liver. Such activity may affect the occurrence of undesirable effects, leading to liver damage. The data collected in Table 3 indicate that for each of the considered inhibitors, there is a moderate probability of the occurrence of this type of undesirable effects; the lowest probability was noted for derivative 2. Another indicator of drug toxicity is the rat oral acute toxicity (ROA) index, referring to the maximum lethal dose in mammals (rats and mice), which is one of the basic indicators of toxicity when evaluating potential drugs. The collected data clearly confirm that for each of the considered derivatives, the probability of exceeding the limit value (ROA > 500mg/kg) is negligible. The considered inhibitors were also analyzed in the context of generating skin sensitization, and the obtained values clearly indicate a low probability of this phenomenon in the case of derivative 1; a much higher probability of this type of side effect is expected for compounds 2 and 3. The interaction of the tested drugs with the eyes is determined by the parameters of eye irritation/corrosion (EI/EC). In both cases, the collected data indicate a slight probability of such adverse effects when using the tested derivatives. A common side effect associated with the use of chemotherapeutic drugs is their mutagenic effect; many studies indicate that the implementation of anticancer therapies has contributed to secondary cancers [51,52]. Therefore, it is important to determine the risk of using new agents and to be aware of the relevant analyses. The evaluation of the tested compounds indicates that the tested compounds are characterized by a moderate risk of mutagenic activity. Therefore, it would be advisable to carry out research that allows a reliable assessment of this property.\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 3019 10 of 17\nThe analysis of the properties of the tested inhibitors indicates a significant deficit related to the low water solubility of the tested compounds. An important step necessary for their potential use as drugs is to determine the most convenient form of their application, which can be a solution based on a solvent suitable for use in pharmaceutical products."

It is derivative 1 that experiences the highest solubility, followed by derivative 2, with derivative 3 having the lowest solubility. This decreasing trend holds for all studied solvents, with no exceptions. It has to be emphasized that the solubility of derivative 1 is substantially larger than the other two. When comparing the best-performing solvents, this difference is almost 8 times greater and more than 31 times greater than for 2 and 3, respectively. It is also evident that these two solvents are particularly effective in the dissolution of the studied compounds, namely DMSO and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). In fact, the latter solvent performed best for all three studied derivatives, with x1 = 8.06\u00d7 10\u22122, x2 = 9.80\u00d7 10\u22123, and x3 = 2.44 \u00d7 10\u22123.

The DMF solvent ranked third in the case of all derivatives (x1 = 2.66 \u00d7 10\u22122, x2 = 3.66 \u00d7 10\u22123, x3 = 3.69 \u00d7 10\u22124). It is also worth mentioning that 4- formylmorpholine (4FM) transpired to be a more effective solvent than acetone, acetonitrile, and dioxane, not to mention the considered alcohols, which were to worst-performing solvents in the studied collection. Also, most classical solvents were outperformed by the three lactones and glymes studied. Even cyrene and ethyl lactate, which were the least effective solubilizers among the studied green solvents, can be regarded as interesting alternatives to many traditional solvents. The three most effective solvents stand out significantly among the tested chemicals, although in the case of derivative 3, which in general happens to be the least soluble one, these differences are least pronounced. They can be all classified as polar aprotic solvents; however, other solvents of this type, like, e.g., acetone and acetonitrile, are not that effective. A closer inspection reveals that NMP, DMSO, and DMF are characterized by the highest dipole moments among all considered solvents (\u00b5NMP = 4.09 D, \u00b5DMSO = 3.96 D, and \u00b5DMF = 3.86 D), and at least for these three systems, the increase in the dipole moment results in the solubility increase in the studied derivatives. The two best-performing solvents, namely NMP and DMSO, were also used to create binary solvents with water. This was carried out by mixing the organic solvent and water in different molar proportions with a 0.1-mole step. It can be expected that in such solvent mixtures, a cosolvation effect will occur, which will result in a solubility increase compared to neat solvents. The results of these studies are summarized in Tables 5 and 6. Two distinct patterns can be observed for DMSO and NMP. In the former case, a cosolvation effect indeed takes place, and the DMSO\u2013water mixture with a composition corresponding to x*DMSO = 0.9 yields a solubility greater than the neat organic solvent. It has to be said, however, that this increase is not very pronounced, and amounts to around 5%. In the case of NMP, however, no cosolvation effect takes place, and the solubility simply increases with the increasing content of the organic solvent. Nonetheless, an important observation is the fact that even small amounts of the organic part in the binary solvent result in quite a substantial solubility of the studied derivatives, and even the x* = 0.1 compositions are responsible for a larger solubility than many neat organic solvents. This is important from an environmental and safety perspective, because it enables the use of small amounts of organic solvents in order to achieve the desired concentration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. This is particularly important for NMP, as it can hardly be considered a green solvent, although it is still used in the pharmaceutical industry [53,54].\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 3019 11 of 17\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 3019 12 of 17\nTable 6.

Only a selected portion of the obtained spectra can be found in Figure 3, in which the FTIR spectra of pure derivatives are shown, together with the spectra of their residues obtained after solubility determination in three solvents, namely DMSO, DMF, and NMP.

The accumulated values show that the use of this type of solvent, which still maintains high solubility even for the lowest considered fraction of organic solvent, allows a significant reduction in the toxicity of the studied system by up to 60%, relative to the pure solvent.\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 3019 14 of 17"

            "text": "The studies of the basic indicators describing the physicochemical properties of the tested 5-nitroisatin derivatives allow the conclusion that the tested compounds have the correct characteristics in terms of most of the analyzed parameters and meet the requirements of all the basic rules used in the design of drugs. The analysis of the values describing the absorption of the tested drugs, their ability to penetrate cell membranes, and potential bioavailability clearly confirms the good abilities of the tested substances in these respect. The considered inhibitors can probably inhibit only selected enzymes from the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family, such as CYP1A2 and CYP1A4, which may translate into the limited hepatotoxicity expected for the tested group of drugs. The tested inhibitors have good characteristics in terms of rat oral acute toxicity (ROA) index and potential eye irritation or corrosion. Many more warning signals were observed in the case of the potential carcinogenicity of the tested drugs, which, unfortunately, is quite a common side effect among chemotherapeutic drugs. We must be aware that the presented data and the conclusions drawn from them are based on the results of modeling, which is able to largely predict the discussed properties; however, further consideration of the tested compounds as potential drugs requires the experimental confirmation of these properties. The requirement of drugs to have a very low aqueous solubility necessitated the search for new pharmaceutical solvents, which could be used at various stages of drug manufacturing. The research conducted allowed an extensive set of data to be collected, clearly indicating a wide spectrum of solvents resulting in satisfactory solubility. Among the studied compounds, derivative 1 was found to have the best solubility in all studied systems. When taking into account the tested solvents, the best effects were noted in the case of DMSO, NMP, and DMF. An important aspect of the conducted research is the observation that the use of binary solvents based on water and DMSO or NMP, even with a relatively low share of the organic fraction, ensures very good solubility, several times higher than that obtained with other tested solvents. The use of such systems significantly reduces the toxicity and environmental effects of the tested mixtures. The obtained collection of solubility data can guide other authors in their research and lay the foundation for future solubility modeling and screening regarding the studied compounds.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/biomedicines11113019/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.C. and T.J.; methodology, P.C. and T.J.; software, P.C.; ADMET analysis, P.C., B.S. and K.S.; formal analysis, P.C. and T.J.; resources, P.C.; synthesis A.S.; UV-VIS measurements, T.J. and P.C.; IR measurements, T.J. and A.S.; NMR measurements, A.S.; data curation, P.C. and T.J.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.C., T.J. and A.S.; review and editing P.C., T.J., A.S., B.S. and K.S.; visualization, P.C. and T.J.; supervision, P.C.; project administration, P.C.
