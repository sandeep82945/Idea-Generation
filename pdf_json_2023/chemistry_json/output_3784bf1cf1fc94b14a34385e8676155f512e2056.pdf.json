            "text": "Spirulina (Arthrospira maxima) is a filamentous cyanobacterium used since ancient times by the Aztec civilization and the first inhabitants of Central Africa, valued not only for its high nutrient content, but also for its important pharmacological potential, highlighting effects such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, immunostimulant, antiviral, hypolipidemic, antigenotoxic, among others. In addition, it has been used as a nutritional supplement because it is enriched with proteins, carbohydrates and lipids [1,2]. These pharmacological effects have been attributed to its antioxidant activity, due to the content of certain phycobiliproteins such as C-phycocyanin, phycoerythrin and allophycocyanin, which reduce oxidative stress [3]. Currently, several strategies have been proposed in the design of pharmaceutical forms, with the aim of improving the pharmacokinetic properties of biological materials, one of them is by implementing the use of nanoparticles. Particularly, the use of nanoparticles inmedical sciences has great benefits in the treatment of different diseases by increasing the solubility of the active principle, increasing the surface area, modifying themorphology, absorption, bioavailability of the transportedmolecules and the versatility to be administered by different routes [4]. Microscopy has been one of the techniques of great importance in the research and development of particles for pharmacological purposes, facilitating their evaluation and characterization since factors such as structure and particle size have been responsible for the final activity of the drug [5]. Therefore, the aim of this work focuses on the elaboration of phycobiliprotein nanoparticles extracted from Spirulina (Arthrospira maxima) by the high energy milling method and its characterization by FTIR and microscopic technique."

            "text": "Phycobiliproteins were extracted from Spirulina (Arthrospira maxima, Spiral Springs, USA). Thus, 5g of spirulina were resuspended in 20 ml of PBS with mechanical agitation for 2 min. Subsequently, it was frozen in liquid nitrogen (-196 \u00b0C) for 2 h and subjected to thawing in a water bath (30 \u00b0C) for 30 min to ensure cell rupture. The samples were kept protected from light. Then, centrifuged at 10,000 RPM in a refrigerated ultracentrifuge (4 \u00b0C), the supernatant was recovered from the blue phycobiliprotein indicator by repeating the centrifugation cycle. Finally, the supernatant was lyophilized at -50 \u00b0C and 0.0133 mBar for 36 h until a fine light blue powder was obtained. The lyophilized phycobiliprotein extract obtained from Spirulina maxima, were used to create the nanoparticles bymeans of high energymill (Pulverisette 7, Fritsch, Germany), where milling times were selected according to the procedure reported byNeri-Torres et al., [6], considering 1, 2, 3 and 4 h at 500 RPMwith cooling pause times of 30 min for each hour of milling. A total of 7 g of ExPhy was placed in the milling bowls in dry at room condition. Microscopic characterization of the phycobiliprotein nanoparticles obtained at different milling times was performed. Nanoparticle morphology was described from confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images (LSM 880/Elyra PS.1, Carl Zeiss, Germany), while atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used for particle size evaluation (Bioscope Catalyst, Bruker, USA) and ImageJ software for image analysis. To evaluate the effect of high-energymilling and composition on the functional groups of the obtained phycobiliprotein extract nanoparticles, FTIR analysis was performed using an IlluminatIR II JY Smiths Detection model IR2 spectrophotometer. Spectrograms were obtained and analyzed using OriginPro 8 software (SR0v.8.0724; OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA)."

Figure 1(f-j) shows the images obtained by AFM, in which a gradual decrease of the particle size can be appreciated (without milling: 500 nm \u2013 1.2 \u00b5m; 1 h: 140-200 nm; 2 h: 90-130 nm; 3 h: 70-90 nm; 4h: 25-55 nm), showed that the optimum milling time was 4 h to obtain nanoparticles with an average size of 52 \u00b1 10 nm. Similar results were previously reported by Neri-Torres et al., [6], in in which spirulina maxima nanoparticles were characterized, obtaining similar particle sizes at 3 hours after high-energy milling. Figure 2 shows the infrared spectra comparing the phycobiliprotein extract versus the spectrum obtained from the nanoparticles obtained after 4 h of milling. Assigning at 3288 cm-1 the stretching of the OH groups of the COOH groups. At 2938 cm-1 the band corresponding to the CH3 groups was found. At 1540 cm\n-1 the signal of the stretching of the unsaturated carbons is found. Finally, at 1402 cm-1 the signal of the C-CO-O groupwas assigned and at 650 cm-1 toN-substituted amides. Notably, an increase in the resolution of the bands was observed, attributed to the reduction of the surface area of the phycobiliprotein nanoparticles, as well as to the exposure of various functional groups."
