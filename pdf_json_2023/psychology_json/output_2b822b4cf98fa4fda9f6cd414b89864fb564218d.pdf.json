    "abstractText": "An evaluation of the expression and predictive significance of the MDM2 gene in brain lower-grade glioma (LGG) cancer was carried out using onco-informatics pipelines. Several transcriptome servers were used to measure the differential expression of the targeted MDM2 gene and search mutations and copy number variations. GENT2, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Onco-Lnc, and PrognoScan were used to figure out the survival rate of LGG cancer patients. The protein\u2013protein interaction networks between MDM2 gene and its co-expressed genes were constructed by Gene-MANIA tool. Identified bioactive phytochemicals were evaluated through molecular docking using Schr\u00f6dinger Suite Software, with the MDM2 (PDB ID: 1RV1) target. Protein\u2013 ligand interactions were observed with key residues of the macromolecular target. A molecular dynamics simulation of the novel bioactive compounds with the targeted protein was performed. Phytochemicals targeting MDM2 protein, such as Taxifolin and (-)-Epicatechin, have been shown with more highly stable results as compared to the control drug, and hence, concluded that phytochemicals with bioactive potential might be alternative therapeutic options for the management of LGG patients. Our once informatics-based designed pipeline has indicated that the MDM2 gene may have been a predictive biomarker for LGG cancer and selected phytochemicals possessed outstanding interaction results within the macromolecular target\u2019s active site after utilizing in silico approaches. In vitro and in vivo experiments are recommended to confirm these outcomes.",

The P53 protein is a transcription factor regulating the expression of a wide effective range of genes that play a role in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and DNA repair [2]. It also plays a pivotal role in starting a cell protection program in the response to intracellular stresses. Hence, p53 mediated diverse signal transduction networks engaged in the cell\u2019s defense against cancer. Notably, intrinsic and extrinsic stress signals affecting cellular homeostatic mechanisms may activate the p53-directed pathway/s [3,4]. Conversely, p53 can induce apoptosis, prime DNA repair, or a DNA replication mechanism by following in a transcription-independent manner [5,6]. Actually, the expression of P53 is low in normal conditions, whereas damage to the DNA of cells may elevate the expression pattern of the P53 protein [7,8]. The p53 protein loses its ability through interacting with MDM2, a negative regulator of p53 protein expression [9]. In higher eukaryotes, two closely related proteins named MDM2 (also known as HDM2 for its human homolog) [10] and MDMX (also known as MDM4) [11] closely monitor p53. MDM2 and MDMX primarily carry out their carcinogenic activity by negatively regulating the p53 protein\u2019s stability and activity in a feedback loop, as they collaborate to inhibit p53\u2019s transcriptional activity [10,12]. The structure of MDM2 is like a hydrophobic groove that is made up of a loop and two helices. The back of the groove is made up of two sheet structures. The structural part that links with P53 sites is made up of the key residues: Leu54, Leu57, Gly58, Ile61, Met62, Tyr67, Gln72, His73, Val75, Phe91, Val93, His96, Ile99, and Tyr100 [13\u201315]. The MDM2 gene is found on chromosomes 3q15 and 12q14 and it has a total length of 491 amino acid residues, and it is primarily regulating p53 stability through ubiquitination, which targets the tumorsuppressor protein for unregulated proteasome degradation, whereas MDMX primarily operates as a major p53 transcriptional antagonist independent of MDM2 in the absence of its expression [16]. Simultaneous disruption of the p53-MDM2/MDMX linkages results in prolonged and robust p53 activation, implying a possible anticancer approach [17\u201319]. Recently discovered is that MDM2 has been found to disrupt the function of p53 via blocking p53 transcriptional activity and p53 protein degradation; such inconsistent activity of MDM2 for suppression of p53 expression is related to the higher progression of various types of malignancies, especially brain cancer [20\u201322]. It is important to note that MDM2 overexpression is linked to poor survival, for breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, and brain lower-grade glioma\u2019s patients [23\u201326]. To date, many drugs have been found on the market, but most of them have fewer and more side effects. Further, plant-derived compounds are safer and effectively work towards brain cancer. There has been an excellent intention for discovering cancer therapeutics from bioactive plant sources because anticancer drugs that are derived from plant sources are less expensive than synthetic cancer therapeutics [27,28]. Medicinal plants have fewer toxic effects on human health than synthetic products [29]. Several plant-derived substances, including Vinblastine [30], Taxol [31], and Topotecan [32], etc., are used as cancer therapeutics in clinical research. Because of recent advances in genomics and proteomics, determining the target prospective phytocompounds has exhibited effective anticancer potential in several clinical cancer research studies [33,34]. However, the discovery of new anticancer drugs has become an urgent requirement in modern times because of raising the drug\u2019s resistance properties to cancer cells. In contrast, bioactive phytochemicals or plant-derived compounds have significantly positive outcomes in several clinical trials [35]. Several well-known phytochemicals have been discovered to possess anticancer characteristics in colorectal, prostate, breast, and glioblastomas [36,37]. Phytochemicals possessed potential anti-proliferative effects in cancer tissues via modulating several of the cancer\u2019s cellular signaling mechanisms [38\u201340]. In this current in silico study, firstly, we have conducted in-depth research to explore the nature and clinical relationship of the p53 and MDM2 gene in the formation of brain lower-grade glioma (LGG) cancer by using several cancer data sets and suggested that the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2977 3 of 31\nMDM2 gene can be a prognostic biomarker for the early stage LGG cancer. Additionally, to overcome the disease\u2019s severity, we utilized the computational drug design methods, which suggested some natural flavonoid-derived compounds which have potential anticancer properties, and also checked its ADMET properties, because of the positive outcomes from the ADMET results following the molecular docking with the MDM2 protein (PDB ID-1RV1). Afterward, the best-selected phytochemicals were applied for post-docking analysis and molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) study to evaluate their potential for inhibiting the overexpression of MDM2 protein."

Following that, the genetic alteration appearance of the MDM2 gene was examined utilizing data from several brain cancer studies. Based on our research findings, it was observed that the rate of MDM2 change varied considerably among various LGG investigations. Among these investigations, MDM2 was primarily changed in glioblastoma, with the highest incidence of modification at 11.90%. LGG studies, on the other hand, also had the lowest rate of change (Figure 5B). Finally, a distinctive transcriptional analysis was performed between the expression of MDM2 mRNA and probable CNAs. The amount of MDM2 mRNA expression was found in this investigation, and the expression was the most overexpressed CNA on the RNA seq V2 RSEM scale. Shallow deletion, on the contrary, was the most reported change based on expression frequency (Figure 5C).

A hydrogen-bonding acceptor map, a hydrogen-bonding donor map, a hydrophobic map, and a hydrophilic map are displayed in each and every predictive AS. As a result, an oxygen atom will also accept the hydrogen bond from the receiver if it is located in a metal binding zone, and it will also be associated with a metal center. Polar hydrogen on amide nitrogen was produced in the donor region [41]. Site Score examines the ligand-binding prime of a site and correctly classifies prospective binding sites to remove those likely to be un-relevant to the pharmaceuticals and determines the drug-ability of a binding site through the D-score [42]. By combining Site Score and D-Score, we identified five potential binding sites. The most promising of the binding sites for MDM2 residues is designated as AS1, which can be predictive. Glide is looking for the advantageous relationships between ligand and the receptor molecules (Grid-based Ligand Docking with Energetics). The shape and features of the receptor are shown on a grid by several field sets that gradually yield increasingly accurate ligand measurements [43].

Analysis of SASA Value\nThe solvent accessible surface area, also known as the SASA, is an additional trajectory of MD simulation that displays the quantities of changes in protein surface area when subjected to extreme circumstances [46]. Initially, overlapping SASA values were found for 10 ns time after, then they showed some fluctuations (Figure 11D). The compounds such as CID-439533 (blue) and CID-72276 (orange) displayed lower SASA values to determine the more compactness of the targeted protein surface, and these values are steady. On the other hand, control and CID-5281616 (green) displayed the standard value compared to the selected protein\u2013ligand complex.\n2.9.5. Study of Rg\nThe radius of gyration or Rg of the protein\u2013ligand complexes was measured to find out how they moved and how stiff they were [47]. A graphical demonstration was found of Rg values from the following (Figure 11E). Almost all the phytochemicals were found to be more stable and showed the same rigidity with few fluctuations of the protein\u2013 ligand complex. In contrast, the control drug displayed moderate fluctuation, and more fluctuation stayed between 25\u201345 ns, comparatively to other selected ligand compounds. The compound CID-439533 showed more rigidity among all compounds.\n2.9.6.

            "text": "Several research studies have recently reported that abnormal amplification of the MDM2 gene in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma causes the protein degradation of the p53 gene that initiates the high progression of tumor tissue in brain cancer [48]. This study compared MDM2 gene mRNA expression patterns in different types of cancer samples, particularly in LGG cancer samples, with their comparable normal samples, which were overexpressed in the brain tissue and CNS cancers [49]. In addition, the expression is downregulated in the following cancers including gastric cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, leukemia, sarcoma colorectal cancer, lymphoma, and many more (Figure 1). Moreover, based on a variety of clinicopathological criteria, MDM2 was found to be considerably elevated in LGG when compared to normal samples (Figures 2 and 3). In this way, there is a significant relationship between higher MDM2 expression and the potential for the formation of tumor metastasis. Numerous studies have also established the MDM2 gene\u2019s efficacy as a prognostic biomarker in a variety of cancer types, including human lung carcinomas, cervical carcinogenesis, bladder cancer, neck cancer, and ovarian cancer, as well as glioblastoma [50,51]. As a result, it is proposed that the unregulated expression of the MDM2 gene relates to the development of LGG. MDM2 has recently gained attention as an effective therapeutic target due to its clear correlation to cell cycle control and cancer. Consequently, all bioinformatics approaches were carried out in this study using many powerful publicly accessible datasets, revealing that MDM2 may be an effective prognostic biomarker for brain lower-grade glioma cancer treatment. The phosphorylation or methylation of MDM2 in the promoter region may be responsible for the different roles in several types of human cancer. To investigate this, we have analyzed the amount of methylation of the MDM2 gene promoter in LGG using a variety of clinicopathological variables (Figure 4). The frequency of promoter methylation fluctuates drastically between LGG phases, and the level of methylation was effectively higher in tumor samples than in normal ones. On top of that, 13 cancer studies were used to assess the mutations and CNAs in the MDM2 protein sequence to determine whether the gene has functional relevance in LGG development. Overall, 28 alterations were discovered, with 24 being missense mutations (Figure 5). Additionally, some studies proposed that finding genomic regions that undergo frequent change could be a useful strategy for identifying oncogenes in human cancers [52]. It became clear because of this finding that MDM2 could play an important function in the formation of LGG. The MDM2 gene\u2019s prognostic significance for LGG was determined using a KM plotter from following sites GENT2, GEPIA, UALCAN, Onco-Lnc, and survival curve analysis revealed that decreased MDM2 expression was associated with a greater OS and DFS (Figure 6). In addition, there was a potent correlation between the reduced expression of the MDM2 gene and a better prognosis across a wide variety of brain tissue subtypes, such as molecular, AJCC, Dukes, grade, and histological subtypes (Figure 7). There must be a way to figure out which gene is effectively responsible for the changes in the expression of and chances of survival in a specific cancer; that gene could be a potential biomarker for earlier cancer prognosis [53]. There is a relationship between the survival rate and the validation of possible biomarkers [54]. It is hypothesized that the MDM2 gene could serve as a marker and inhibiter of tumors for the reduced expression of human breast, prostate, and gastric cancers [8,55]. Additionally, there is a positive link between MDM2 overexpression and a poor prognosis for LGG cancer. Furthermore, the survival plots from multiple databases demonstrated that MDM2 expression might play a role in LGG development and prognosis. The Pearson correlation coefficient and co-expression coefficients were used to evaluate\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2977 19 of 31\nthe activity of the MDM2 gene. In this study, the UALCAN and GEPIA databases were examined in order to find the genes that were positively linked with MDM2 in LGG tissues. The cBioPortal interaction network was constructed using 20 associated genes from the website (Figure 8) and Gene MANIA, where Pearson CC > 0.47 was significant. Both databases estimated that RP11-61102.3 and YEATS4 had the highest Pearson CC value with the MDM2 gene, which was corroborated by both databases. The interaction indicated 77.64 percent co-expression, indicating that the connected genes are expressed at similar levels in related conditions, and 3.63 percent co-localization, indicating that the correlated genes are expressed in a similar tissue or cell as the other related genes (Supplementary Figure S1). Gene MANIA was also used to evaluate another interaction network, and the network was constructed using the \u201cautomatically selected weighting approach\u201d that was based on biologically processed data (Supplementary Figure S2) and, hence, 20 genes that interacted with each other were linked to a variety of cancers. MTBP has the possible prognostic characteristics of LGG [56]. CDKN2A has the potential to be the main target for the treatment of a number of human malignancies [57]. Moreover, TP53 and MDM4 have strong prognostic characteristics for the progression of brain cancer [58,59]. The in silico drug design approach has been becoming increasingly popular in recent times because of its proven potential to accelerate the discovery of safe and effective new medications [60\u201362]. This is accomplished through the evaluation of the outcomes of pharmacophore screening, molecular docking, analysis of post-docking interaction, molecular dynamic simulation (MDS), and prediction of noble and effective drug compounds against a higher range of diseases in a computer-simulated environment [63\u201365]. In silico drug design can be used to speed up the development of quality drugs by evaluating the outcomes of these processes [14,49]. Three of the four phytochemicals used in this study were effectively chosen to be lead compounds, while the fourth was used as a controlled drug for the purposes of this investigation. Along with conducting \u201cfact checks\u201d and providing secondary complementary judgments on high-performance assays, ADMET profiling is a cost-effective technique for significantly reducing the costs of drug development [66\u201368]. These four phytochemicals\u2019 pharmacokinetic features were determined with the help of online servers from the pkCSM pharmacokinetics and Swiss ADME organizations, as indicated in (Table 2) [69\u201371]. As part of the study\u2019s pharmacokinetic components, Lipinski\u2019s five-rule pharmacophore properties (molecular weight, rotational bond count, logP value, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and degree of infringement) were evaluated for all selected ligands using Lipinski\u2019s five-rule approach (violation level) [72\u201374]. All the selected natural bioactive phytochemicals possessed better human intestinal absorption, better BBB value, AMES toxicity, no carcinogenicity, and no hepatotoxicity for both the human and mice research model, except for the selected control compound for our research study [75\u201377]. Molecular docking is a technique for predicting the interactions between molecules under conditions with the most stringent compositional confirmation and the lowest binding affinity conceivable [78,79]. Using the Maestro application, which employs sitespecific super molecular docking to assign a potential binding score, the drug candidates with the most significant and stable binding score were identified. Three natural bioactive compounds and a placebo were chosen for a molecular docking investigation with the p53-MDM2 protein (PDB ID: 1RV1). The control medicine, Temozolomide (PubChem CID 5394), was reported to have a docking affinity of \u22125.0 Kcal/mol. Among the natural bioactive compounds that were chosen, Taxifolin had the highest binding affinity of \u221210.0. This is the case when Galangin was \u22127.4 and (-)-Epicatechin was \u22128.8, as represented by Table 3. In the subsequent stage, Ligplot+ (Version 2.2), an excellent investigational tool that typically runs via the Java interface, was used to analyze the 2D protein\u2013ligand interaction visualization. In addition, the docked receptor\u2013ligand interactions were visualized using the Development Studio Visualizer tool v19.1.0.18287 (BIOVIA), a sophisticated visualizer tool for drug discovery (Figures 9 and 10).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2977 20 of 31\nMolecular dynamic simulation (MDS) can help in the development of noble medications and performance data by providing insight into biomolecular interactions and the interface between the arrangement and activity of proteins [45,80], which was also conducted in our study using the YASARA software package. The simulation tool\u2019s trajectory has also been used to flawlessly examine the root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), the radius of gyration (Rg), the number of hydrogen bonds, and the surface area of the molecule that is accessible to solvent (SASA). It was determined how reliable the p53-MDM2 protein structure was by measuring the RMSD value of its protein backbone; a smaller number suggests more stable molecules. Our findings demonstrated that the RMSD values of protein\u2013ligand interactions are adequate, with mean values of 2 (the lowest value for CAP is roughly 0.8, with maximum values of 3), indicating a more favorable docking location and no structural disruption between the two molecules (Figure 11A). The RMSF provides a quantitative measure of average protein fluctuations relative to some fixed point of reference, and RMSF graphs illustrate how these fluctuations are indicative of changes at the residue level. The RMSF of the c-alpha atoms can be seen illustrated in Figure 11B. The total number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds developed between the macromolecules and their ligands was counted to determine the conformational stability, and the protein-ligands (-)-Epicatechin and Taxifolin were found to generate the most of these bonds, with strong conformational stability of 190 and 188, respectively. These proteinligands are more conformationally stable than the control compound (Figure 11C). Using the simulation trajectories, the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of the protein-ligands was also measured to find out how the size of the drug-like molecules changed along the simulation trajectories [81]. Because of the structure\u2019s instability, which places hydrophobic amino acid residues in close proximity to the water molecule, one of the highest SASA values is attributable to this factor [82]. The SASA result from the MDS trajectory revealed that Galangin exhibited the highest SASA values (6000 \u00c52); however, (-)-Epicatechin, Taxifolin, and Temozolomide (control) also had greater SASA values than what Galangin exhibited (Figure 11D). In addition, Rg is a distance measurement between the protein\u2019s center of mass and its terminus, and so it indicates how great that distance is. Consequently, this metric evaluates the compactness of the protein molecule and offers additional information regarding the folding features of the protein [83]. Furthermore, slackpacking is denoted by a higher Rg value, and compact packing is denoted by a lower Rg value (Kousar et al., 2020). The Rg values are summarized in (Figure 11E), with (-)-Epicatechin having the highest matching capacity (26.4) when compared to the reference or control ligand compound (Temozolomide, 26.5). The ligand compounds, Taxifolin and Galangin, are also compact, and numerical affinity values are reported in both cases (28.45). The weaker binding affinity was determined in quercetin and genistein (26.2). The protein\u2013ligand complexes\u2019 binding free energies were displayed by the Analysis of Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA). In this case, all of the natural bioactive compounds chosen had more of the potential binding free energy value than the control drug compound (Figure 11F). There was insufficient clinical evidence to substantiate LGG treatment by targeting the p53-MDM2 pathway loop in our current in silico analysis. This in silico study examined a novel method of treating LGG and found that more wet lab and clinical tests are required to confirm the efficacy of these drug-like compounds that target the MDM2 protein. Therefore, after the evaluation of their anticancer potential both the in vitro and in vivo research animals, these potentially bioactive phytochemicals may be exploited as an alternative therapeutic option for the human brain lower-grade glioma (LGG) cancer treatment.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2977 21 of 31"

The GENT2 database of Gene Expression was used for collecting MDM2 gene expression data across 72 pairs of tissues [86]. Using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA 2) database, the mRNA expression of the MDM2 gene, in addition to its expression in cancer stages utilizing TCGA data in COAD, were explored further [87].

It pinpoints and ranks the sites on a protein\u2019s surface that are most suited to bind with an external ligand. The current SiteMap facility in Maestro expands the original SiteMap facility that was previously available (named hapmap) [41,93]. Site mapping works similarly to Goodford\u2019s GRID method, precisely in the original approach [94,95]. Three steps are involved in the SiteMap evaluation; in the first, the locations are initially defined by a grid, and then the dots are classified into subsets based on several parameters. In the second stage, grid mapping is used to create files that can be used to visualize the maps. Finally, the value of properties is determined, and locations are recorded in Maestro format. Every phase is completed by executing an impact job. For the purposes of molecular docking research, the optimal binding pocket was selected based on having a higher Site Score and DScore. The Site Index is computed by doing a weighted average calculation on a number of different features:\nSiteScore = 0.0733 sqrt(n) + 0.6688 e \u2212 0.20 p.\nIn this equation, n represents the number of site points, which is capped at 100, e is the enclosure score, and p is the hydrophilic score, which is fixed at 1.0 in order to restrict the impact of hydrophilicity in charged and strongly polar sites [93,96,97]. Dscore and SiteScore are both calculated based on the same properties, although Dscore uses various coefficients and percentages:\nDScore = 0.094 sqrt(n) + 0.60 e \u2212 0.324 p.\nThere are no bounds on how high a hydrophilic score can be for Dscore. One of the criteria that differentiates \u201ceasy\u201d and \u201cdruggable\u201d targets from \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201cundruggable\u201d ones is this aspect of the target [93]. Different and even sometimes contradictory requirements necessitate the employment of distinct functions to identify binding sites and categorize drug consumption. It has been discovered that ligands with nanomolar and even sub-nanomolar affinities have been found for the PTP1B phosphate pocket [98,99]. However, they share some similarities with pharmaceutical drugs in terms of charge configuration, as these compounds are more closely related to those found in natural phosphate substrates and, hence, lack the drug-like properties typically associated with pharmaceuticals [49,100]. Even though SiteMap should identify a site with such high ligand interaction, the sitemap score should not consider it druggable."

In the YASARA dynamics software program (version 4.3.13), molecular dynamics simulation research was conducted by using the AMBER14 force field. The MDS operation was conducted in a high-configured computer (Intel corei9, Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU, NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with windows operating system (OS). The complexes were subjected to preliminary cleaning, optimization, and hydrogen bond interaction management. Cubic simulation cells with periodic boundary conditions were employed alongside the TIP3P solvation model [106]. The temperature of the simulated system was 310 K, the pH was 7.4, and the salt concentration (NaCl) was 0.9% by weight [107]. The initial step in the process of minimizing the amount of energy used involved applying methods with the steepest gradient and an approach called simulated annealing (5000 cycles). Through the use of particle mesh Ewald techniques, long-range electrostatic interactions with a cutoff radius of 8 \u00c5 were computed [108,109]. The simulation systems were set up with a time step of 2.5 fs [107]. After each 100 ps of simulation time, the trajectories were saved. In order to investigate the RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and hydrogen bonding, the simulations trajectories were extended for 100 ns while adhering to constant pressure and the Berendsen thermostat. Based on this, the YASARA trajectories were used in the computation of the binding free energy using the MM-PBSA methods. A higher positive energy value indicates a higher grade of energy [110,111]. The equation that was applied for the computations in order to determine the binding free energy was as follows:\nBinding Energy = EpotRecept + EsolvRecept + EpotLigand + EsolvLigand \u2212 EpotComplex \u2212 EsolvComplex\nAll molecular dynamic simulation screenshots were generated using the premium YASARA software. According to the trajectory performance, the RMSD, RMSF, proteinligand contacts (P-L), and the hydrogen bond interactions were conducted to measure whether or not the complex structure of protein and ligand could be maintained over time [112,113]. The RMSD in MD simulations is the average distance an atom moves in a given time interval with respect to a fixed time point [45,114]. To begin, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the protein\u2019s structural atoms (C, backbone, side chain, and heavier particles) is calculated. Next, the RMSD of the protein\u2019s fit ligand atoms over all time points is aligned and compared to the reference time point (in our study 100 ns). The RMSD of a periodic MD simulation with period x can be found with the application of the following equation (Equation (1)).\nRMSDx = \u221a 1 N \u2211 N i=1 ( r\u2032i (tx)) \u2212 ri (tref ))2 (1)\nHere, N indicates the total number of atoms that were picked, tref stands for the reference time, and r\u2032 describes the location of the atoms that were chosen in system x after the point of the reference system has been superimposed on it. The RMSF has mostly been utilized for detecting and tracking local variations in the conformational structure of protein complexes [115]. Calculating the RMSF of an MD simulation of a protein with the given number of residues and using the continuity equation (Equation (2)) is one possible way to do it.\nRMSFi = \u221a 1 T \u2211 T t=1 < ( r\u2032i (t)) \u2212 ri (tref ))2 > (2)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2977 25 of 31\nHere, T generally denotes the trajectory time over which the RMSF is calculated; tref is the reference; r\u2032 denotes the position of the selected atoms in residue i after transposing on the reference frame, and angle bracket (< >) indicates the mean of the square distances covered over the selected atoms in the residues."

            "text": "In this study, the aim was to precisely check the elevated level of MDM2 gene in LGG disease compared to the standard samples and based on a variety of clinicopathological properties. Consequently, several integrative bioinformatics web-based tools were applied to publicly accessible datasets, revealing that MDM2 may be an effective prognostic biomarker for this disease to determine the frequency of promoter methylation varies dramatically across the various phases of LGG. The level of methylation was greater in tumor samples compared to the normal or standard samples. The MDM2 gene\u2019s prognostic significance for LGG was determined using a KM plotter from multiple websites, including the ULCAN, Onco-Lnc, GENT2, and GEPIA; therefore, the survival plots from multiple databases demonstrated that MDM2 expression might play a role in LGG development and prognosis. So, it is a major prognostic biomarker and acts as an alternative therapeutic site for the control of the advanced level of brain cancer. Additionally, the virtual mediated ADMET screening was used to identify 3 phytocompounds out of 50 that were predicted to have the most drug-like features. According to the results of the molecular docking study, these ligand molecules have the maximum binding affinity against the targeted receptor. This result was comparable to that of the reference anti-brain cancer medicine, Temozolomide. These pharmacological analogues, including Taxifolin, (-)-epicatechin, and Galangin, maintained more persistent and compact connections with the residues in the active region of MDM2 protein. The MD simulation was performed to confirm that these molecules have the best activity toward the targeted receptor, and they showed more positive results. As a result, they may be capable of overcoming the developing of LGG cancer. After all, these flavonoid-based compounds have the potential to be used as alternative therapeutic agents in LGG; nevertheless, additional study is necessary to verify that they do not possess any harmful side effects.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28072977/s1, Supplementary Table S1: A comparison of MDM2 transcriptional level between LGG tumor subtypes and regular individuals was made using the Oncomine database.
