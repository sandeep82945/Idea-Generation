The reasons\nfor this association are poorly understood. Preliminary findings with young\nadults have suggested that executive functions and functional impairmentmay\nmediate the relationship between symptoms of ADHD and mixed anxiety and\ndepressive symptoms. The objective of this study was to explore whether\nADHD symptoms, executive functions and functional impairment predict\nanxiety in a clinical adolescent population. In addition, we investigated the\npossible mediating role of executive functions and functional impairment in\nthis relationship.\nMethod: One hundred adolescents with ADHD and their parents completed\nthe ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD RS-IV), the Behavior Rating Inventory of\nExecutive Function (BRIEF), and the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale\n(WFIRS) in relation to an RCT study. The adolescents also completed the\nScreen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED). Analyseswere\nconducted using regression and a serial multiple mediator model.\nResults: In the regression analyses, parent-rated ADHD symptoms were\nunable to predict anxiety, but ADHD inattention symptoms predicted anxiety\nin the self-ratings. Executive dysfunction and functional impairment predicted\nanxiety in both the parent- and self-reports. In the mediation analyses ADHD\nsymptoms alone did not predict anxiety, but executive dysfunction mediated\nthis relationship as expected. Functional impairment mediated this relationship\nindirectly through executive functions. The results were similar in the\nparent- and self- reports.\nConclusion: The results pinpoint executive dysfunction as an important\ntreatment target for alleviating anxiety in adolescents with impairing\nADHD symptoms.\nKEYWORDS\nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, executive functions, functional impairment, adolescents, anxiety\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood (1) and is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that lead to impairment in at least one life domain (2). Through adolescence, symptoms of ADHD typically impair functioning in various contexts, such as school, social settings, and emotional wellbeing. Comorbid psychiatric conditions are common in this patient group, and anxiety, depression, conduct disorders and substance misuse are among the most common disorders (3\u20135). Although pharmacological treatment for ADHD has shown beneficial effects on core ADHD symptoms as well as improvements in functional impairment and health-related quality of life (6, 7), the lack of data on longer-term treatment effects makes it unclear whether the changes in health-related quality of life are mediated by symptom changes, changes in functional impairment or other factors.\nAnxiety disorders (ADs) are among the most prevalent disorders in child and adolescent populations, and ADHD and AD are comorbid with each other in 25\u201350% of cases (8\u201310). This comorbidity rate is greater than chance and is still present after controlling for overlapping symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating and restlessness (11, 12). The presence of both disorders is associated with more attentional problems, school fears and lower social competence than the presence of either ADHD or anxiety alone (8). While there is evidence of a prospective relationship between ADHD and AD across development, the reasons for this association are still unclear. Previous studies have suggested a specific relationship between the ADHD inattentive type and anxiety (9, 13, 14). Similarly, ADHD patients with sluggish (slow) cognitive speed have shown more internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, than patients with the hyperactive or combined subtype of ADHD (15, 16). Jensen et al. (17) found that anxiety reported in ADHD populations may differ from anxiety in non-ADHD populations, with concerns about competency and performance being the more common components rather than specific phobias per se. This form of anxiety has been suggested to arise primarily when one\u2019s cognitive processing abilities are overwhelmed by the demands of the environment (18). Following from this, two possible factors linking ADHD and anxiety are executive functions (EFs) and functional impairment. EFs represent higher-order cognitive processes that help us achieve our daily goals (19\u201321). EFs are mainly supported by the prefrontal cortex and typically include planning skills, response inhibition, mental flexibility, working memory, initiation and set shifting (22). Dysfunctional EFs may prevent the acquisition and implementation of skills, leading to difficulties handling everyday challenges related to academic functioning (23), interpersonal problems (24), and mental health (25\u201327). Although dysfunctional EFs are common\nin ADHD and have been hypothesized to underlie the functional impairments related to this disorder (28, 29), these cognitive dysfunctions are not restricted to ADHD but are rather common in various psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders and ADs (30, 31).\nPrevious research with university students with ADHD has demonstrated that executive functions may predict functional impairments. Dvorsky and Langberg (32) showed that executive functions, including motivation and emotional regulation skills mediated the association between ADHD symptoms and overall daily functioning. They also found organizational skills to mediate the association between ADHD symptoms and academic achievement rated by grade point average. Dorr and Armstrong (33) found that high executive functions were related to lower levels of functional impairment in patients with low ADHD symptoms, but high EF was not associated with low functional impairment in a sample of university students with a high level of ADHD symptoms. Research conducted with adolescents with ADHD has demonstrated that dysfunctional EFs are related to multiple domains of impairment even after controlling for symptoms of ADHD (23, 34). In particular, the metacognitive aspects of EFs (e.g., mental flexibility, planning and organization) have proven salient for school functioning and homework completion in this age group (34, 35). As children and adolescents with ADHD experience functional impairment in multiple domains, including school, the social arena and family life, they are also more vulnerable to developing low self-esteem. In addition, they are more often involved in risky behavior than their non-ADHD peers (36). Since functional impairment and the accompanying feeling of incompetencemay trigger stress and anxiousness, it is important to explore the role of functional impairment in the ADHDanxiety relationship, as this may guide our understanding of underlying mechanisms for this association and help us develop more targeted treatment interventions for this patient group.\nTo our knowledge, only one published study has explored the relationship between symptoms of ADHD and mixed anxiety and depressive symptoms with a particular emphasis on EFs and functional impairment. In this study, EFs and functional problems explained 42 to 53% of the variance in mixed anxiety and depressive symptoms in a population of university students (37). A limitation of this study was the lack of a systematic diagnostic assessment in the population.\nThe aim of the present study was thus to explore whether ADHD symptoms, executive dysfunction and functional\nAbbreviations: ADHD, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; ADHD-RS\nIV, ADHD Rating Scale IV; BRIEF, The Behavior Rating Inventory\nof Executive Function; CAP, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; CI,\nConfidence Intervals; EF, Executive Functions; GAD, Generalized Anxiety\nDisorder; SCARED, The Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional\nDisorders; WFIRS-P/-S, Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale\nparent-report/self-report versions.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Hypothetic relationships among ADHD symptoms, functional impairment, executive dysfunction, and anxiety symptoms with the accompanying measurements.

The assessment and diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder requires a thorough clinical assessment, including a developmental history, a somatic assessment, and an examination of comorbid psychiatric disorders, and the use of questionnaires to assess ADHD symptoms (ADHD rating scale), which were completed by adolescents, parents, and teachers. The diagnostic criteria for hyperkinetic disorder in ICD-10 resemble the criteria for ADHD combined presentation in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder 5th edition (DSM-5). According to Norwegian ADHD guidelines (41), hyperkinetic disorder may also be diagnosed in patients with severe inattention symptoms, similar to the DSM-5 ADHD inattentive type. At study enrolment, each participant was interviewed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (Kiddie-SADS-PL) at the CAP units to confirm the ADHD symptoms and assess psychiatric comorbidity.

Second, to explore which of the subscales or indices from the ADHD RS-IV and the BRIEF questionnaire that predict anxiety the most while controlling for the other questionnaire subscale, we carried out two separate regression analyses: first with the two ADHD RSIV subscales simultaneously and second with the two BRIEF\nindices simultaneously. Multicollinearity was checked to avoid high correlations (r =0.70 and above) between the independent variables, as recommended by Dormann et al. (51). The normality of residuals was checked by visual inspection of QQ plots.\nTo explore whether EFs and functional impairment act as mediators in the association between ADHD symptoms and anxiety, we conducted a serial multiple mediator model recommended by Hayes (52) using the PROCESS macro for IBM SPSS (www.processmacro.org). The PROCESS command generates bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) for all indirect effects as well as possible pairwise comparisons between indirect effects. We used 5,000 bootstrap samples. The ADHD RS total score was entered as the predictor variable (X), the BRIEF GEC score was entered as the first mediator (M1), and the WFIRS total score was entered as the second parallel mediator (M2) (see Figures 2, 3). The adolescent- rated SCARED total score was the outcome variable in both mediation analyses. The analyses were conducted using parent- and self-report questionnaires in separate analyses. Age and sex were considered confounders and entered as covariates in all the analyses. In addition, we carried out supplementary analyses also adjusting for IQ and SES. These analyses were restricted to the 62 participants in the regression analyses and 58 and 52 participants in the mediation analyses using parent- and self-reports, respectively, with available data on these variables. The estimated effects were essentially the same (data not shown). Missing data were handled using single imputation on scales using the mean score if 70% or more of the questions were answered.

The first indirect effect of only EF mediating the association between ADHD symptoms and anxiety was significantly positive (coefficient= 0.466, CI 0.013 to 1.024). Thus, levels of ADHD symptoms predicted levels of executive dysfunction, which again mediated the severity of anxiety symptoms.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Children and adolescents with ADHD have an increased risk of comorbid ADs compared to their non-ADHD peers. In addition, anxiety symptoms tend to have an earlier onset, be more severe and be frequently associated with other psychiatric conditions (54, 55). Although the comorbidity rates of ADHD and ADs are well documented, the etiology of these associations is poorly understood. As such, the first aim of the current study was to examine whether parent- and self-rated ADHD symptoms, executive dysfunction and functional impairment were able to predict anxiety in a clinical population of adolescents with symptoms of ADHD. Overall, the main patterns were similar in the adolescent and parent reports, with stronger associations in the self-reports. This finding was as expected, considering that anxiety is an internalizing disorder and that only the adolescents reported anxiety symptoms. Among the self-rated ADHD symptom scores, only the inattention domain predicted anxiety, while hyperactivity symptoms were unable to predict anxiety. This was found regardless of age and sex and is in line with previous studies showing inattention symptoms to be more strongly associated with anxiety than hyperactivity (14, 56). On the other hand, none of the parent-rated ADHD symptom scores were able to predict anxiety. This was somewhat surprising and might suggest that\nparents are less sensitive in capturing this symptom association, perhaps because of the less overt nature of both inattention symptoms and anxiety symptoms. On the other hand, only including a self-report measure of anxiety could have affected this finding.\nAmong the EFs, both the global executive composite (GEC), the behavioral regulation index (BRI) and the metacognitive index (MI) were able to predict anxiety in both self- and parentreports. Neither the BRI nor the MI index was significantly able to predict anxiety over and above the other BRIEF index when controlling for age and sex. The behavioral regulation index reflects both emotional dysregulation, mental inflexibility and impulsivity. An association between emotional dysregulation and anxiety would be expected. In addition, an association between mental inflexibility and anxiousness has previously been found in studies examining measures of shifting and updating using neurocognitive measures on clinical and nonclinical samples of anxious children and adolescents (57\u201359). Impulsivity, on the other hand, has previously been shown to be inversely associated with anxiety, with studies showing less inhibited children and adolescents presenting lower symptoms of anxiety than more inhibited children (60, 61). More detailed subgroup analyses are recommended to explore these associations further.\nThe metacognitive index includes cognitive functions such as working memory, task completion, planning and organization, and organization of materials, all skills strongly related to school performance and the attainment of future goals. As such, it is reasonable to link experienced difficulties in these areas with both low self-esteem and lack of control, which again may increase anxiousness. Finally, the functional impairment score, representing self-concept, social activities, school functioning, life skills and risky activities, predicted anxiety in both the parent- and self-reports. In sum, both executive dysfunction related to behavior regulation and metacognitive functions and functional impairment may be important to assess when working with adolescents with ADHD and comorbid anxiety.\nThe second aim of this study was to explore the roles of executive dysfunction and functional impairment as possible mediators in the ADHD-anxiety relationship. The results from the mediation analyses showed that ADHD symptoms alone were unable to predict anxiety when controlling for executive dysfunction and functional impairment. Executive dysfunction mediated the ADHD-anxiety pathway, as expected; thus, more ADHD symptoms significantly predicted more severe executive dysfunction, which mediated the severity of anxiety symptoms. This pattern was found when controlling for age and sex and was similar in both parent- and selfreports, strengthening the validity of the result. This result was similar to a previous study (37) where EFs and functional impairment explained most of the variance in combined anxiety and depressive symptoms in college students with ADHD.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 08 frontiersin.org\nAnother recent study found that EFs and anxiety/depression significantly mediate the relationship between ADHD and quality of life (62). Together, these results suggest that executive dysfunctions rather than ADHD symptoms per se may lead to comorbid anxiety or mood disorders and difficulties in daily life. In the current study, ADHD symptoms alone were unable to predict functional impairment, but functional impairment predicted anxiety. Functional impairment was thus unable to mediate the ADHD-anxiety relationship by itself but acted as a mediator through EFs. Executive dysfunction has previously been linked to functional impairment in both school and social settings in children and adolescents with ADHD (63, 64). Rosello\u0307 et al. (65) found impulsivity/emotional lability as well as planning and organizing to be significant predictors of functional impairment in family, social, academic, and risky activity areas in young adults with ADHD. Shift and working memory marginally predicted impairment in the same areas. These findings suggest executive dysfunction to be an important target in the prevention of functional impairment across several life domains.\nThis study has several strengths. First, this was the first study to explore the mediating effect of EFs and functional impairment on the ADHD-anxiety relationship in a clinical adolescent population. Second, we included ADHD patients with common psychiatric comorbidities, which increases the generalizability of the results to a clinical CAP setting. Third, the use of both parent- and self-report measures improves the validity of the results. Finally, males and females were equally represented among the participants, which is positive when controlling for the possible moderating effect of sex on the ADHD-anxiety relationship. This study also has several limitations. First, most of the participants (91.0%) were on ADHD medication when completing the questionnaires; thus, the results may not be representative of adolescents with ADHD who are not on medication. Second, the participants showed subthreshold ADHD symptoms, which may limit the generalizability to participants with more severe symptoms. Third, data on ADHD symptoms, executive functions and functional impairments were restricted to parent- and selfreport questionnaires. The additional use of neurocognitive measures and computer tests to assess inattention symptoms and executive functions could have added valuable supplemental information in this study. Fourth, a high correlation between the main index scores (see Supplementary Table S6) indicates some conceptual overlap between the EF and functional impairment questionnaires. The two measures, however, also represent distinct, non-overlapping problem areas, making each questionnaire valuable as a clinical assessment instrument. Fifth, since this is a cross-sectional observational study, we have no longitudinal data to explore different developmental pathways related to the included variables. Moreover, the inclusion of only quantitative data limits an in-depth understanding of the origin and consequence of the different associations\nbetween cognitive functions/ADHD symptoms, functional impairments, and anxiety in this adolescent population. The inclusion of qualitative methods, such as interviewing parents and adolescents about life conditions, symptom development, psychosocial treatment and medication effects, could improve our knowledge of these associations for different patient groups and is recommended for use in future studies."

ADHD core symptoms were, however, not able to predict anxiety when controlling for executive functions and functional impairment in a mediation analysis. Executive dysfunction acted as a substantial mediator in this relationship, while functional impairment mediated this relationship only through EFs. This result pinpoints executive dysfunction as an important treatment target in alleviating anxiety in adolescents with impairing ADHD symptoms. Thus, the additional assessment of EFs using a broadband questionnaire such as the BRIEF parent- and self-report versions is recommended when assessing ADHD and comorbid disorders in adolescent populations. The results also suggest that adolescents with ADHD with normal EFs may have a lower risk of experiencing anxiety. These results improve our knowledge of the association between ADHD and anxiety in a clinical ADHD population. More studies are needed to replicate these findings across different age groups."
