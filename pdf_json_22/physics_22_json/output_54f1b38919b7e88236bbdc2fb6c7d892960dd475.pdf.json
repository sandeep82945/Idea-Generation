    "abstractText": "We use the first principle calculation to investigate the intrinsic magnetism of graphitic carbon nitrides (GCNs). By preserving three-fold symmetry, the GCN building blocks have been built out of different combinations between 6 components which are C atom, N atom, s-triazine, heptazine, heptazine with C atom at the center, and benzimidazole-like component. That results in 20 phases where 11 phases have been previously reported, and 9 phases are newly derived. The partial density of states and charge density have been analyzed through 20 phases to understand the origin of the presence and absence of intrinsic magnetism in GCNs. The intrinsic magnetism will be present not only because the GCNs comprising of radical components but also the \u03c0-conjugated states are not the valence maximum to break the delocalization of unpaired electrons. The building blocks are also employed to study alloys between g-C 3 N 4 and g-C 4 N 3 . The magnetization of the alloys has been found to be linearly dependent on a number of C atoms in the unit cell and some magnetic alloys are energetically favorable. Moreover, the intrinsic magnetism in GCNs can be promoted or demoted by passivating with a H atom depending on the passivated positions.",

By preserving three-fold symmetry, the GCN building blocks have been built out of different combinations between 6 components which are C atom, N atom, s-triazine, heptazine, heptazine with C atom at the center, and benzimidazole-like component. That results in 20 phases where 11 phases have been previously reported, and 9 phases are newly derived. The partial density of states and charge density have been analyzed through 20 phases to understand the origin of the presence and absence of intrinsic magnetism in GCNs. The intrinsic magnetism will be present not only because the GCNs comprising of radical components but also the \u03c0-conjugated states are not the valence maximum to break the delocalization of unpaired electrons. The building blocks are also employed to study alloys between g-C\n3 N 4 and g-C 4 N 3 . The magnetization of the alloys has been found to be\nlinearly dependent on a number of C atoms in the unit cell and some magnetic alloys are energetically favorable. Moreover, the intrinsic magnetism in GCNs can be promoted or demoted by passivating with a H atom depending on the passivated positions.\nVarious types of 2-dimensional (2D) materials have been explored their magnetism that suite for spintronics and magnetic devices. For metal-free materials, 2D organic frameworks such as triangulenes and graphitic carbon nitrides (GCNs) are candidates that possess intrinsic magnetism with high Curie temperature and high flexibility1\u20134. Organic radicals can be linked by a triazine which is a carbon-nitride ring stabilizing paramagnetic 2D organic frameworks5. The triangulene which is a fragment of graphene can be scaled its magnetization by increasing a size of the fragment6,7. It can be crystallized by connecting its edges with other chemical groups8. For graphene, each C atom spends 3 electrons to form \u03c3 bonds and leaves one electron forming conjugated \u03c0 bond suppressing graphene\u2019s magnetism while the magnetism in triangulenes exists due to lack of \u03c0 conjugation. Accordingly, the magnetism of 2D organic frameworks can be suppressed by a delocalization of electrons in \u03c0 orbitals affected by compressive strain9.\nThe intrinsic magnetism in graphene can be risen by a defect producing a half-filled band of \u03c0 orbitals10. The defects can be either voids or impurities splitting the spin-up and spin-down pz states at the Fermi level ( EF ) and inducing a magnetic moment11\u201314. One method used to create void defects in graphene is by doping N atoms where the voids are surrounded by N atoms, then N-doped graphene becomes magnetic15,16. Although, high doping, void, and passivation concentrations lead to phase instability limiting amounts of spin density in graphene17\u201319.\nIn this work, we focus on GCNs whose several magnetic and non-magnetic phases have been predicted. For instance, g-C4N3 is a magnetic phase with one Bohr magneton ( \u00b5B ) per unit cell20,21, and C14N12 bears 2 \u00b5B per unit cell of magnetization4. C9N7 and C10N9 are magnetic phases while C3N2 , C4 N, and C9N4 are nonmagnetic4,15. Their magnetism arises from an unpaired electron contributing a magnetic moment to a system. The structure that has two unpaired electrons can be non-magnetic or magnetic depending on they are in singlet or triplet states, respectively22,23. Anyhow, magnetic GCNs have not yet achieved in experiments. The GCN that is typically synthesized are g-C3N4 , but it is non-magnetic. It is in a form of s-triazine or heptazine networks and a candidate for photocatalysis and carbon dioxide adsorbing materials24\u201331. Some extra-treatments have been\nOPEN"

For example, the magnetism in GCNs can be enhanced by defects, hydrogenation, and fluorination34\u201340. GCNs are particularly porous, so a metal atom can sit in a hole and induces magnetism of the structure41,42. The metal atom can also be a linkage connecting atoms and build blocks, but the Curie temperature is not as high as a light-atomic linkage43,44.\nHerein, we present an aspect that structures of GCNs can be constructed from building blocks of C\u2013N assisting us to understand the presence and absence of intrinsic magnetism of GCNs. The construction is focused on the building block whose two components are connecting together with three-fold symmetry. The first principle method based on spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) has been employed to study thermodynamics stability, electronic structure and magnetism of GCNs. The absence and presence of intrinsic magnetism of GCNs have been analyzed through their electronic structures. We propose two mechanisms playing a crucial role in GCNs magnetism; firstly, one out of two components in the building block must have a free radical, and secondly, \u03c0 conjugation does not present near the Fermi energy if both components have free radicals. We also present a series of study on hydrogenated and alloy GCNs; the GCNs prefer to be passivated by a H atom at some locations able to activate or deactivate the intrinsic magnetism, and the magnetization of GCNs can be modified by mixing different building blocks."

            "text": "Building blocks. The building blocks are C, N, H, s-triazine (TRI), heptazine (HEP and HEC) and tetracyclic benzimidazole (BEN) components where HEC is a heptazine with C atom at the center instead of N atom (see Fig.\u00a0 1). Each component will be joint with other components in three directions preserving three-fold symmetry except for H atom that will be only dangling with C and N atoms. One can think of an alloy which is a mixture of several components; however, this work is limited to study connections between two types of components where the first component is a core, and the second component is a connector. Therefore, in this study, GCNs are constructed from cores which are TRI, HEP, HEC and BEN, and connectors which are C, N, TRI, and HEP while a H atom is neither a core nor a connector but a passivating atom. GCNs are typically labeled by a tuple of numbers of C and N atoms, ( nC , nN ), in a unit cell which is sometimes ambiguous, so they are, instead, designated as core-connector, e.g. TRI-N whose common name is g-C3N4 is a structure where TRI is a core and N is a connector.\nBy our constructions, there are 20 phases reported here; 11 phases, to the best of our knowledge, have been reported before4,20,21,24\u201329,29,45\u201352, and 9 phases which are HEP\u2013TRI, HEP\u2013HEP, HEC-C, HEC\u2013HEP, and BEN-X (X = C, TRI, HEP, HEC, and BEN) are newly derived by this study (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in Supplementary Information).

Noting that GCNs can be synthesized from chemical compounds, e.g., melamine, melam, and melon, so their Eform would change according to precursors.\nFigure\u00a0S2 in Supplementary Information shows that the Eform seems to decrease with respect to N concentration. However, it is not a good presentation because different types of GCNs are being compared. Bu et\u00a0al.19 shows that the formation energy of N-doped graphene and GCNs with pyridinic N increase similarly with amount of N concentration up to 0.25%. The former starts increasing higher if N concentration is more than 0.3%. The structures with pyrrolic N also have formation energy higher than the structures with pyridinic N. In this work, TRI, HEP, and HEC are components with pyridinic N, while BEN is a component with pyrrolic N. The formation energy of structures with BEN component is thus higher than that of structures without BEN component. The formation energy of structures with HEP component are lower than that of structures with HEC component even HEP is a N-doped HEC. The structures with N connector are more energetically favorable than those with C connector.\nTRI\u2013TRI has the highest Eform among other phases. The C\u2013N\u2013C angle of TRI component is ideally 120\u25e6 . It is 108.4\u25e6 in TRI\u2013TRI while it is about 114\u25e6 to 120.5\u25e6 in other structures whose the TRI component is constituent. This angle in TRI\u2013TRI that is much sharper than other phases may cause high strain on the structure throwing the Eform of TRI\u2013TRI to 1.368 eV.\nMagnetic and electronic properties. The intrinsic magnetism in GCNs is present or absent due to combinations between cores and connectors. Table\u00a0 2 presents the magnetizations of GCNs where each phase is constructed from the core and the connector labeled in each column and row, respectively. Since the core and the connector are commutable, the values below diagonal should be the same as the values above diagonal. Most phases, whose intrinsic magnetism are present, have either HEC or BEN as components except for HEC-C, BEN-C and BEN\u2013BEN that are non-magnetic. Two more magnetic phases are TRI-C and HEP-C. The magnetism is absent in C\u2013C, C\u2013N, TRI-N, HEP-N and HEP\u2013HEP where C\u2013C and C\u2013N are graphene and 2D honeycomb carbon nitride, respectively. Noting that N\u2013N is a N2 molecule, so it is disregarded.\nWe count a number of valence electrons, which do not form \u03c3 bonds, per unit cell ( ne ) of each phase in order to understand a key factor governing presence or absence of the intrinsic magnetism. In a honeycomb structure, a C atom covalently bonds with its three nearest atoms leaving one lone electron, while a N atom leaves two electrons which is a lone pair. In TRI, HEP, HEC, and BEN, the pyridinic and pyrrolic N atoms bonding with only two nearest atoms have ne = 3 ; therefore, TRI and HEP have even ne considered to be non-magnetic components, and HEC and BEN have odd ne considered to be magnetic components. We expect that if the ne is even, all electrons left over from \u03c3 bonding will pair together suppressing the intrinsic magnetism of the structure. In contrast, if the ne is odd, a single electron will be a free radical granting a magnetic moment. The parity of the ne of each phase is presented in Table\u00a02 and labeled in blue if the ne is odd and yellow if the ne is even. As labeled, the GCNs are magnetic or non-magnetic if the ne are odd or even, respectively, except for C\u2013N, HEC\u2013HEC and BEN\u2013HEC. The magnetic behavior of the excepted phases, in contrast, can be explained through the projected\nTable 1. The Eform of each GCN is reported in meV per atom unit where each column and row are core and connector components, respectively. The blue\u2013white\u2013red colors are shaded according to the values from lowest to highest. N\u2013N, in contrast, denotes a N2 molecule.\nTable 2. The magnetization of each GCN is reported in \u00b5B unit where each column and row are core and connector components, respectively. The parity of the ne of each phase is labeled by blue and yellow denoting odd and even, respectively.\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2343 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05590-4\nDOS (PDOS) and the localization of the charge density. The intrinsic magnetism of GCNs is then discussed separately for each core component in subsections below. The PDOS will be shown by types of atoms where CA and NA denote C and N atoms of the A component, respectively.\nC-. Particularly, C atoms in graphene spend their three valence electrons to form \u03c3 bonds and one valence electron to form conjugated \u03c0 bonds with the entire structure. Lieb10 has shown that the net spin is not vanished if numbers of atoms in two sublattices of a bipartite lattice such as graphene are not equal. (Ovchinnikov53 has proposed the same equation of the net spin for hydrocarbons). The theorem was validated by an existence of magnetic moment in defective and hydrogenated graphenes13,14. In this case, C\u2013C is a perfect lattice graphene where the C atoms in two sublattices are equal, so it is non-magnetic.\nFor C\u2013N (equivalent to N\u2013C in Table\u00a02) which also has a honeycomb structure, lone pairs of N atoms and lone electrons of C atoms form \u03c0 conjugation without defects suppressing the intrinsic magnetism even the ne per the unit cell is odd. This is according to the PDOS of CN (see Fig.\u00a0S3 in Supplementary Information) that the pz orbitals of C and N atoms dominating the states across the EF . It is because the pz electrons delocalize and pair together across several cells even the ne in the unit cell is odd.\nTRI- and HEP-. TRI and HEP components have even ne , so they themselves obtain no magnetic moment, and their combinations, TRI\u2013TRI, HEP\u2013TRI, and HEP\u2013HEP, consequently, yield no magnetism (see Table\u00a02). TRI-N and HEP-N, whose each N connector leaves one lone pair, are also non-magnetic. In contrast to TRI-C and HEP-C, the C connector has one ne which is the pz electron granting a magnetic moment to the whole structures. If that is the case, why does the pz electron of the C connector not delocalize and pair with pz electrons of TRI? Because the pz states of the C connector and CTRI atom are in different energy levels and both are in the same energy levels with pz states of NTRI atom (see Fig.\u00a02). This is also true in HEP-C, TRI-N and HEP-N. For TRI-N and HEP-N, the pz electrons of the N connector already form a lone pair, so the levels mismatch does not matter.\nFor the electronic property, TRI\u2013TRI and TRI-N are semiconductors with energy gaps 0.87 and 1.56 eV, respectively, while TRI-C is a half-metal with spin-up energy gap 2.15 eV (see Table\u00a03). For TRI-C, the px and py states of NTRI atoms dominate the states around the EF , and the pz states of NTRI and the C connector are at a bit below the EF . The pz states of CTRI and NTRI atoms hybridize with one another at below \u2212 3 eV which is at different energy level with the pz states of the C connector (see Fig.\u00a02b). Noting that they appear at the same energy level below \u2212 5 eV, but that is deep from the EF . This result also holds for TRI-N where the pz states of the N connector hybridize with that of NTRI atoms at \u2212 2 eV but not with that of CTRI atoms (see Fig.\u00a02d). For TRI\u2013TRI, since its core and connector are the same, main features of its PDOS are similar to TRI of TRI-C and TRI-N that the px and py states dominate at valence states near the EF while the pz states appear at below \u2212 4 eV (see Fig.\u00a0S4 in Supplementary Information). Besides, in TRI-C and TRI-N, the pz states of NTRI appear two times; one hybridizes with the pz states of the connector, and another one hybridizes with the pz states of CTRI atoms.\nMataga54 has proposed that the electrons of atoms in the ring (TRI) are paired through the \u03c0 conjugated bonds leaving their non-bonding \u03c3 orbitals and non-bonding \u03c0 orbital of the C connector to be unpaired. This is in accordance to our result that the spin moment comes from the valence states of the px and py states of atoms in the ring and the pz states of the C connector. The pz states form a narrow band as in Mataga\u2019s discussion, but the px and py states form a wide band.\nThe HEP-X (X = N, TRI, and HEP) structures whose each component obtains even ne are non-magnetic semiconductors with 1.17, 1.53, and 1.21 eV for energy gaps, respectively (see Table\u00a03). Since HEP-C is magnetic, it has two energy gaps which are 1.92 and 0.31 for spin-up and spin-down, respectively. The PDOS of HEP-C (HEP-N) shown in Fig.\u00a03 demonstrates the hybridization between atoms in the core and connector similar to that\nTable 3. The energy gap of each GCN is reported in eV unit where each column and row are core and connector components, respectively. The spin-up (x) and spin-down (y) energy gaps are reported in a x (y) form if they are discrepant but are reported in a single value if they are the same. The electronic behaviors are denoted as M for metals and SM for semi-metals.\n5 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2343 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05590-4\nFigure\u00a02.

The spin-up (blue) and spin-down (red) PDOS of (b) TRI-C and (d) TRI-N are projected on px (dottedline), py (solid line) and pz (solid line) orbitals of C and N atoms.\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2343 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05590-4\nof TRI-C (TRI-N). For HEP-N, the px and py DOS between spin-up and spin-down are the same for HEP-N. In contrast, for HEP-C, the feature peak of spin-down DOS shift to above the EF causing the discrepancy between its spin-up and spin-down DOS. This feature also happens if the PDOS of TRI-C and TRI-N are compared. For HEP\u2013TRI and HEP\u2013HEP (see Figs.\u00a0S5 and S6 in Supplementary Information), the pz states of atoms in the core and connector appear at the same energy level below \u2212 2 eV while their px and py states appear near the EF.\nHEC-. The electronic properties of HEC-X (X = C, N, TRI, HEP, and HEC) shown in Table\u00a03 are various where HEC-C is a semimetal. HEC\u2013TRI and HEC\u2013HEC are a half-metal with 2.08 and 2.47 eV, respectively, for spinup energy gap. HEC-N (HEC\u2013HEP) is a semiconductor where its spin-up and spin-down energy gaps are 2.06 (1.77) and 0.17 (1.54) eV, respectively. Figure\u00a04d\u2013f show the structures of HEC-C, HEC-N, and HEC\u2013HEC, respectively.\nThe HEC component has odd ne ; therefore, its combination with the C connector, HEC-C, is non-magnetic while its combinations with N, TRI, and HEP components are magnetic with one \u00b5B per unit cell. On the one hand, the PDOS of HEC-N (see Fig.\u00a04b) shares similar features to that of TRI-C and HEP-C where the px and py spin-up (spin-down) states are at valence maximum (conduction minimum) level and the pz states are at deeper energy level. On the other hand, the PDOS of HEC-C shows a distinguish feature that the pz states of every atom appear at the valance maximum level while their px and py states shift to conduction minimum level. Because HEC-C has a number of electrons smaller than HEP-N by two electrons, so the EF which is a function of number of electrons shifts down from above to below the px and py PDOS peaks (see Fig.\u00a04a). Moreover, CHEC atoms contribute their pz states to the valence maximum level in contrast to previous phases, so the pz orbitals of CHEC and NHEC atoms and the C connector can form conjugated \u03c0 bonds delocalizing the electrons and suppressing the intrinsic magnetism. For HEC\u2013TRI and HEC\u2013HEP (see Figs.\u00a0S7 and S8 in Supplementary Information), their PDOS share similar features to HEP\u2013TRI and HEP\u2013HEP, but they are magnetic.\nDespite that HEC\u2013HEC has even ne , it has a magnetization for 2 \u00b5B per unit cell. Here, we run into the second question that why does the reason for the absence of intrinsic magnetism discussed above not be able to use with HEC\u2013HEC? As aforementioned, for TRI, HEP, and HEC components, the pz states of their C atoms are at deep energy level while the pz states of their N atoms appear twice, first at shallow level and second at the energy level as C atoms. Even though the \u03c0 conjugation in HEC\u2013HEC occurs at energy below \u2212 1 eV, only pz states of NHEC atoms have a contribution near the EF (see Fig.\u00a04c). The electrons in the valence maximum level hence do not form conjugated \u03c0 bonds, but localize at the px and py states of NHEC atoms. HEC\u2013HEC thus obtains 2 \u00b5B per unit cell, one of which comes from each HEC component, and the most discrepancy between spin-up and spin-down DOS is from the px and py states.\nBEN-. The BEN component has odd ne , so BEN-C and BEN\u2013BEN are non-magnetic, and BEN-X (X = N, TRI, and HEP, HEC) are magnetic with one \u00b5B per unit cell except for BEN\u2013HEC which has the magnetization about 0.45\u00b5B per unit cell (see Table\u00a02). For the electronic property, BEN\u2013TRI (BEN\u2013HEP) is a semiconductor with spin-up and spin-down energy gap about 0.12 (0.11) and 0.61 (0.49) eV, respectively, BEN\u2013HEC is a metal, and others are semimetals (see Table\u00a03).\nThe BEN component contains a C hexagonal ring and three pyrroles (see Fig.\u00a05a\u2013d for structures of BEN-X for X = C, N, HEC, and BEN, respectively). Its PDOS shows that the px and py states are at energy level lower than the pz states (see Fig.\u00a05h). Near the EF , the pz DOS of CBEN atoms and the px and py DOS of NBEN atoms are high while DOS of connector C{TRI,HEP,HEC} atoms are tiny. Consequently, the valence states of BEN\u2013BEN are dominated by the pz states of CBEN atoms, and the px and py states of NBEN atoms appear at lower energy level (see Fig.\u00a05h). For BEN-C, it is non-magnetic, so there is no discrepancy between spin-up and spin-down DOS (see Fig.\u00a05e). Because its number of electrons is smaller than BEN\u2013BEN, so its EF drops below the pz states causing the px and py states are at the valence maximum level. Although, the pz states of CBEN and NBEN atoms and the C connector appear from the EF down to \u2212 4 eV showing a sign of the \u03c0 conjugation but its PDOS near the EF is tiny (see Fig.\u00a05i).\nFor BEN-N, the pz states show the discrepancy between spin-up and spin-down DOS while the px and py states are slightly discrepant between spin-up and spin-down DOS (see Fig.\u00a05f). Therefore, a spin moment of BEN-N comes from electrons in the pz states in contrast to, e.g., TRI-C and HEP-C that their spin moments come from electrons in the px and py states of N atoms. Because BEN-N has a number of electrons higher than BEN-C by one electron, so the EF shifts to higher than the pz states becoming the valence maximum. For BEN\u2013TRI and BEN\u2013HEP, their PDOS features near the EF are from the pz states which is clearly induced by the BEN component (see Figs.\u00a0S9 and S10 in Supplementary Information). The pz states of CTRI atoms show no contribution here while those of CHEP atoms have small contributions. The px and py states of NTRI and NHEP atoms are discrepant in contrast to the PDOS of phases discussed in previous sections. The spin moments of BEN\u2013TRI and BEN\u2013HEP are also from the electrons in the pz states which is similar to BEN-N.\nFor BEN\u2013HEC, its PDOS is a mixing between the characteristics of BEN and HEC components (see Fig.\u00a05g). At the EF , the spin-up and spin-down DOS are from the pz states and the px and py states, respectively, where the former is dominated by the PDOS of CBEN atoms, and the latter is dominated by the PDOS of NHEC and CHEC atoms. The pz states at the EF are actually from the PDOS of every atom except CHEC atoms, so the \u03c0 conjugation does not occur at this level but at below -1.0 eV. Therefore, BEN and HEC components obtain different spin moments where the spin moment of the BEN component is greater.\nSummary. The building blocks can be grouped by their PDOS characteristics into three groups which are the atoms, i.e., C and N atoms, the carbon nitride rings, i.e., TRI, HEP, and HEC components, and BEN component. The individual atoms contribute their pz states as their valence maximum states. The carbon nitride rings have\n7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:2343 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05590-4\nFigure\u00a03.

The BEN component has the pz states of C atoms as its valence maximum states and the px and py states of N atoms at the energy level next to the valence maximum states. If the \u03c0 conjugation forms across the core and the connector of GCNs near the EF , the intrinsic magnetism of GCNs will be suppressed. Otherwise, for a structure with odd ne , the magnetic moment will be localized in the px and py states ( pz states) of N (C) atoms if the structure is a combination with the carbon nitride rings (BEN component).\nBesides, there are three structures which are C\u2013N, HEC\u2013HEC, and BEN\u2013HEC that their magnetism cannot be determined by counting the ne . The C\u2013N is non-magnetic because of the \u03c0 conjugation at the valence maximum level. The HPEC\u2013HEC and BEN\u2013HEC, in contrast, lack of the \u03c0 conjugation at the valence maximum level, so their magnetic moments are localized at each component to the system.\nTwo factors thereupon playing the important role to raise or demote the intrinsic magnetism of GCNs are the ne and the \u03c0 conjugation. The components with odd (even) ne tend to contribute the unpaired (paired) electrons to the system. Their combinations mostly result in presence and absence of the intrinsic magnetism if the ne in\nFigure\u00a04.

For the odd-odd combinations, i.e., C\u2013C, HEC-C, and BEN-C, the pz orbitals of the core and connector form the conjugated \u03c0 bonds pairing electrons across the structures. For the odd-even combinations, e.g., TRI-C, HEP-C, and HEC-N, the \u03c0 conjugation does not occur because the pz states of the C and N connectors are at the energy level same as (different from) the pz states of N (C) atoms of the cores. The pz states of N and C atoms of the cores are also hybridizing at the same energy level but at deeper level. In the even-even case, it does not matter if there are conjugated \u03c0 bonds near the EF . The electrons in each component are paired and contribute no magnetic moment.\nAlloys. The g-C3N4 or TRI-N has been synthesized while the g-C4N3 or TRI-C has yet existed only in the simulation27. TRI-C is magnetic, but its Eform is 133 meV higher than TRI-N (see Table\u00a01). To achieve the intrinsic magnetism, the connectors are alloyed between C and N atoms, so the magnetization can be arisen proportional to a number of C connectors ( Ccon ). The structures of the alloy can be represented by different ordered patterns of C and N connectors created up to 42 atoms per primitive cell for 52 structures (including TRI-C and TRI-N) by using Hart and Forcade\u2019s algorithm55 where some of order structures are illustrated in Fig.\u00a06a.\nFigure\u00a06b is a plot of ratio between the magnetization and the number of Ccon in an ordered structure with respect to a ratio between Ccon and total number of the connectors in the ordered structure. As expected, the magnetization of order structure increases linearly as the number of Ccon in the structure increasing because each Ccon contributes a radical to the system. Figure\u00a06c shows that the formation energy of the ordered solid solutions is below zero with respect to those of TRI-N and TRI-C indicating that the connector C and N atoms are likely to be chemically ordered at low temperature in thermodynamic equilibrium. The transition temperature between order-disordered phase that helps to verify a structure found in the experiment, for instance, HEP/TRI-C/N56, hence needs to be investigated19, but it is beyond the scope of this work.\nHydrogenation. The intrinsic magnetism of GCNs can be altered by a hydrogenation39. Therefore, an atom in each GCN is here passivated by one H atom per unit cell in order to investigate the change in magnetism and the thermodynamically stability. Each GCN has several atomic positions for H atom to passivate, for example, H atom can passivate on CTRI , NTRI , and the C connector of TRI-C which are 3 configurations in total. As a result, the configurations of each GCNs except C\u2013N, that the H atom is passivating with N atoms, have the Eform lower than their non-hydrogenated phases. The H atom passivating with C atom of GCNs yields high Eform because it induces high strain on the structure while the passivation with N atom is on the side of the structure inducing less strain (see Fig.\u00a0S11 in Supplementary Information).\nSince different configurations yield different results in the magnetizations and the Eform , Table\u00a04 shows the magnetization of the configuration of each hydrogenated GCN that has the lowest Eform . Noting that the magnetization of hydrogenated graphene (C\u2013C) is one \u00b5B per unit cell, but it is not reported in Table\u00a04 because its Eform is higher than graphene. For hydrogenated HEC-X, the HEC component whose NHEC atom is passivated by H atom has even ne , so hydrogenated HEC-X obtains one \u00b5B of magnetization per unit cell for X = C and HEC and zero magnetization for X = N, TRI, and HEP.\nFor hydrogenated BEN-X, the HEC component whose NHEC atom is passivated by H atom has also even ne , so hydrogenated BEN-X obtains zero magnetization for X = N, TRI, and HEP. Accordingly, the magnetization of hydrogenated BEN\u2013HEC is one \u00b5B per unit cell because one of its components has even ne while another has odd ne , so the magnetic moments between BEN and HEC are no more annihilated in the hydrogenated case. In contrast, the magnetization of hydrogenated BEN-C is 0.20\u00b5B per unit cell even its ne is odd because its valence electrons can be shared through the \u03c0 conjugation at the valence maximum states.\nFor hydrogenated TRI-X, the TRI component whose NHEC atom is passivated by H atom has odd ne , so hydrogenated TRI-X obtains zero magnetization for X = C and 0.84 and 1 \u00b5B per unit cell for X = N and TRI, respectively. Notwithstanding that hydrogenated HEP-X for X = N, TRI, and HEP obtain odd ne , their thermodynamically favorable configurations yield zero magnetization."

            "text": "Firstly, we present building blocks comprising 19 GCNs (and graphene) and the reason behind their emergent intrinsic magnetism through bonding states and charge density. The structure that has even ne is non-magnetic because all valence electrons are paired suppressing the magnetic moment. The structure that has odd ne can be either magnetic or non-magnetic depending on the valence maximum states are localized or delocalized, respectively. The valence maximum states are ensured to be localized if they are from the px and py orbitals but are not necessary to be delocalized if they are from the pz orbitals. The pz orbitals of every atom in the core and connector must present in the valence maximum states to form the \u03c0 conjugation; otherwise, the unpaired electron will be localized in its component (core or connector) producing the magnetic moment.\nSecondly, we also apply the building-blocks scheme to study alloys mixing between g-C3N4 and g-C4N3 . The magnetization of the alloy increases linearly as a concentration of the C connector, and some promising alloys are energetically favorable. Lastly, a H atom attached on GCN lowers the Eform of the structure. The H atom can change the magnetization of the system depending on a position it is passivating. Therefore, these understandings could lead to the future design for stable GCNs that maintain to be radicals with magnetism."
