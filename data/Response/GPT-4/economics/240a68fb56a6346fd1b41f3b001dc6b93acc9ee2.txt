Comparative Analysis of Dental Health Policies Across Different Regions: Conduct a comprehensive study comparing the effectiveness of various regional dental health policies in Spain. This could include analyzing the impact of free dental care programs for children and vulnerable groups in regions like Navarre and the Basque Country, and comparing outcomes in terms of dental health access, quality of care, and reduction in catastrophic health expenditures.

Longitudinal Study on the Impact of Expanded Dental Health Coverage: Initiate a long-term study to assess the outcomes of the Spanish Ministry of Health's proposal to expand dental care services within the NHS. Focus on evaluating changes in the frequency of dental visits, improvements in oral health, reductions in catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures, and overall effects on public health and inequality.

Evaluation of Preventive Dental Health Programs in Schools: Design and assess the effectiveness of targeted preventive dental health programs in primary and secondary schools. This research could explore the impact of interventions such as dental health education, the provision of free dental care supplies, and regular dental check-ups on improving oral health among children and adolescents, and on reducing future dental care expenditures.

Analysis of Socioeconomic Inequalities in Dental Health Access and Outcomes: Conduct a detailed analysis of the socioeconomic determinants of dental health service utilization and outcomes in Spain. Investigate how income, education, and employment status affect access to dental care, the quality of dental health, and the likelihood of experiencing catastrophic dental expenses.

Impact Assessment of Oral Health on General Health and Healthcare Costs: Explore the broader implications of oral health on general health conditions, such as the association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. This study could assess how improvements in dental care access and quality could lead to better general health outcomes and reductions in overall healthcare costs, including the cost-benefit analysis of integrating comprehensive dental care into primary healthcare services.
