    "abstractText": "The normalization of epidemic prevention and control has exacerbated nurses\u2019 physical and mental stresses. The important role of physical activity in relieving nurses\u2019 physical and mental stresses has received extensive attention from researchers in recent years. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of physical activity on the regulatory emotional self-efficacy, resilience, and emotional intelligence of nurses and explain their interactions. The present study adopted the cluster sampling method. From April to May 2022, a total of 500 nurses in six municipal hospitals in Changsha City were selected. Finally, 402 valid data samples were obtained. Afterward, AMOS 23.0 (by maximum likelihood estimation) was used to process the collected data and analyze the proposed hypotheses by using 5,000 bootstrap samples to test the mediating effects of the structural equation model. The results demonstrated that there are positive correlations between physical activity and resilience (standardized coefficients = 0.232, p < 0.001), resilience and regulatory emotional self-efficacy (standardized coefficients = 0.449, p < 0.001), and emotional intelligence and regulatory emotional self-efficacy (standardized coefficients = 0.330, p < 0.001). The positive influence of physical activity on emotional regulation self-efficacy is completely mediated by emotional intelligence and resilience (standardized indirect effect = 0.237, p < 0.01), and this explanatory power is far higher than any previous study (R = 0.49). The positive emotions generated by an individual\u2019s physical activity have an important explanatory role for individuals who want to establish more emotional regulation self-efficacy, emotional intelligence, and psychological resilience.",

The purpose of this study was\nto investigate the influence of physical activity on the regulatory emotional\nself-efficacy, resilience, and emotional intelligence of nurses and explain\ntheir interactions. The present study adopted the cluster sampling method.\nFrom April to May 2022, a total of 500 nurses in six municipal hospitals in\nChangsha City were selected. Finally, 402 valid data samples were obtained.\nAfterward, AMOS 23.0 (by maximum likelihood estimation) was used to\nprocess the collected data and analyze the proposed hypotheses by using\n5,000 bootstrap samples to test the mediating effects of the structural\nequation model. The results demonstrated that there are positive correlations\nbetween physical activity and resilience (standardized coefficients = 0.232,\np\u00a0 < 0.001), resilience and regulatory emotional self-efficacy (standardized\ncoefficients = 0.449, p\u00a0 < 0.001), and emotional intelligence and regulatory\nemotional self-efficacy (standardized coefficients = 0.330, p\u00a0 < 0.001). The\npositive influence of physical activity on emotional regulation self-efficacy is\ncompletely mediated by emotional intelligence and resilience (standardized\nindirect effect = 0.237, p\u00a0 < 0.01), and this explanatory power is far higher than any previous study (R2 = 0.49).

            "text": "Although the COVID-19 pandemic is greatly weakening, the nurses who are on the front lines of epidemic prevention have not relaxed. On the contrary, with the normalization of epidemic prevention and control in China, nurses have become the main force in applying epidemic prevention and control (Keshkar et\u00a0al., 2021). Every time a major holiday begins or ends, hundreds of millions of people return to their hometowns, schools, and jobs. Nurses are often overwhelmed by having to conduct nucleic acid testing on people from all walks of life and constantly having to repeat boring work processes. This pressure was not only reflected in the fact that they needed to complete more than 8 h of work in protective clothing when the outdoor temperature exceeded 30\u00b0C (73\u00b0F) in summer, it was also reflected in the normalization of epidemic prevention and control likely to be\u00a0continuing for a long time in the future. This form of work will become their norm. Nurses often suffer from excessive psychological pressures that affect their mental health and cause problems, such as job burnout, decreased happiness, and suicidal tendencies (Hamre et\u00a0al., 2020). It is therefore important to know how to relieve these excessive psychological pressures on the nurses through certain means in the post-epidemic era to improve their mental health.\nIn recent years, the relationship between physical activity and individual mental health has received extensive attention from researchers (Chekroud et\u00a0al., 2018). Research shows that people who are physically active have higher levels of mental health, and they tend to be\u00a0less susceptible to mental illnesses, such as anxiety, depression, emotional disorders, and insomnia (Stafseth et\u00a0al., 2022). Physical activity allows people to obtain an emotional experience that liberates them from repressed mental states and then plays a role in eliminating negative emotions (Tamminen and Bennett, 2017). The extended theory of positive emotions believes that an individual\u2019s long-term emotional experience will be\u00a0 transformed into an emotional ability (Fredrickson, 1998). When people are in a negative and repressed emotion for a long time, this actually indicates that they are losing the ability to experience positive emotions (Fredrickson, 1998). When in the midst of a positive emotional experience, a positive emotion actually transforms into an ability to experience positive emotions while also enhancing the ability to resist negative emotions (Fredrickson, 2001). Relevant studies have shown that individuals who participate in physical activity for a long time have higher emotional intelligence, and their perceptions and control of emotions will be\u00a0significantly enhanced (Frazier and Nagy, 1989). Physical activity can make people gain a sense of positive emotional experiences so that an individual\u2019s emotions can be\u00a0 released and relaxed during exercise, thereby reducing or eliminating the impact of negative emotions on the individual\u2019s mental health (Wang et\u00a0al., 2020).\nFor the nurses, their occupational characteristics cause their mental health to be\u00a0affected by more uncertain factors than the general population, such as doctor\u2013patient relationship, working environment, work and rest time, especially in the context of the\nnormalization of epidemic prevention and control, The dull and single work process and severe work environment have led to the accumulation of nurses\u2019 negative emotions (Jeung et\u00a0al., 2018; Alsaqri et\u00a0 al., 2021). When the long-term accumulated psychological pressure cannot be\u00a0 effectively relieved, it will increase the risk of individuals suffering from mental illness (Lorente et\u00a0 al., 2021). Although the psychological pressure generated by the external environment exists objectively, the ability of individuals to resist negative emotions varies from person to person and is affected by many factors, such as emotional regulation, emotional intelligence, and psychological resiliency (Labrague and De los Santos, 2020). It is worth noting that most of the previous studies focused on the descriptive level of the relationship between physical activity and individual mental health, but few studies have paid attention to how physical activity affects individuals\u2019 mental health.\nEmotional regulation of self-efficacy, emotional intelligence, and resilience has been regarded as the major predictor of individual mental health in recent years (Young et\u00a0al., 2011). An individual\u2019s ability to regulate emotions was once considered to be\u00a0an important channel for stress relief (McEwen et\u00a0al., 2015). Emotion regulation, resilience, and social support play a combined and important role in the maintenance of the mental health of frontline health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fino et\u00a0 al., 2021). Regulatory emotional self-efficacy, as an important predictor of individual emotional regulation ability, has received extensive attention from researchers in recent years. Studies have shown that regulatory emotional self-efficacy is significantly related to prosocial behavior, mental health, selfesteem, subjective well-being, and other factors (Bandura et\u00a0al., 2003). Other studies have shown that emotional regulation selfefficacy, emotional intelligence, and resilience can significantly affect individual mental health, and physical activity has an important role in promoting individuals\u2019 mental health, but little attention has been paid to how physical activity affects emotional regulation self-efficacy, emotional intelligence, and resilience, and how they interact to promote an individual\u2019s mental health (Paluska and Schwenk, 2000).\nThis study attempts to achieve the following objectives: (1) to investigate the effects of nurses\u2019 physical activity on their emotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional selfefficacy; (2) to explore the impact mechanism of physical activity on emotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy; (3) to explore whether and how emotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy interact with each other; and (4) to propose suggestions for improving the physical activity of nurses.\nThe contributions of this study are as follows: First, by exploring the effect of physical activity on emotional intelligence, psychological resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy, the research on the influence mechanism of physical exercise on individual mental health was expanded. Second, this study adopted the extended broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, which highlighted the important explanatory role of\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\npositive emotions generated by individuals participating in physical activities to build more regulatory emotional self-efficacy, intelligence, and resilience. Third, this study expanded the research on the micro-influence mechanism of emotional regulation self-efficacy. As in previous studies, regulatory emotional self-efficacy is usually used as a mediator and moderator variable affecting the results of the study, but in this study, regulatory emotional self-efficacy will be\u00a0the target variable.\nLiterature interviews and hypotheses development\nBroaden-and-build theory of positive emotions\nFredrickson (1998). proposed the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions. Through the research on the four positive emotions of happiness, interest, satisfaction, and love Fredrickson (2001) believed that positive emotions could broaden the thoughtaction ability of individuals. Fredrickson pointed out that positive emotions can effectively expand the individual\u2019s attention span, creative thinking, and cognitive ability.\nIn subsequent research, Tugade and Fredrickson (2004). proved that positive emotions play a positive role in relieving negative emotions, improving resilience, and promoting emotional health. Relevant studies showed that physical activity plays an important role in promoting an individual\u2019s physical and mental health and creating positive emotions (Bouchard et\u00a0al., 1994; Gehlhar et\u00a0al., 2022). Based on the extended broaden-andbuild theory of positive emotions, this study attempts to discuss how physical activity affects emotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy."

            "text": "In recent years, there has been a prevailing view in the mass media and academia that the psychological benefits of physical activity may equal or even exceed the physical benefits (Smith et\u00a0al., 1996). Specifically, first, people who regularly participate in sports have higher levels of mental health and are less susceptible to negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, and stress (Scully et\u00a0 al., 1998). Second, exercise can enhance an individual\u2019s emotional state. People who regularly participate in sports have a more optimistic attitude, a higher cognitive level, and a more positive emotional experience (Frazier and Nagy, 1989). Third, exercise can effectively shape personality, and studies have shown that physical activity is positively correlated with self-esteem, emotional intelligence, and self-efficacy (Wang et\u00a0al., 2020; Aouani et\u00a0al., 2022; Liu and Qiang, 2022).\nResilience, as a personality trait, reflects an individual\u2019s ability to cope successfully or adapt well in the face of adversity (Masten, 2001). Individuals with high resilience have a more optimistic\nattitude and more positive emotions. They are often able to face problems head-on and are good at using positive emotions, so they also have a higher sense of well-being, a higher level of mental health, and a stronger ability to deal with emergencies (Chan et\u00a0 al., 2013). In the formation and development of resilience, the consensus view is that resilience is affected by protective factors and risk factors (Kumpfer, 2002). Protective factors include individual factors, such as self-efficacy, intellectual function, attribution style, and self-esteem, as well as non-individual factors such as family environment and social support (Masten and Coatsworth, 1998). When an individual encounters adversity, the body responds quickly to the current environment through protective factors, so that the body can adapt well to the current environment or quickly recover from the traumatic state. Risk factors refer to certain biological, psychological, cognitive, or external environmental factors that hinder the normal development of an individual, such as poverty, physical illness, and the crisis of abuse and violence.\nTo sum up, there are the following connections between physical activity and resilience: First, both physical activity and resilience are important promoting factors for individuals\u2019 mental health. Second, physical activity appears to promote protective factors of resilience such as self-esteem and self-efficacy, while physical activity enhances social support by building wider social networks. Third, individuals enhance their physical, psychological, cognitive, and other abilities by participating in sports, thus reducing the impact of risk factors on psychological resilience. Based on this, this study proposes the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Physical activity has a positive impact on resilience.\nEmotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy\nAccording to the emotional intelligence competency model of Mayer et\u00a0al. (1999)., emotional intelligence is mainly composed of accurately perceiving emotions in oneself and others, using emotions to facilitate thinking, understanding emotional meanings, and managing emotions. Related research suggests that people with high emotional intelligence may have better levels of mental health and well-being because they have a better ability to regulate stress and flexibility to improve the effects of negative emotions (Ciarrochi et\u00a0 al., 2002). People with high emotional intelligence have a better ability to understand, control, and manage emotions, and they seem to be\u00a0more successful at avoiding interpersonal squabbles and fights, and thus have better social support and relationships (Ciarrochi et\u00a0al., 2002). People with high emotional intelligence have a better ability to perceive and use emotions, as they are good at regulating their emotions, and thus they have a more positive emotional state (Salovey et\u00a0al., 2009; Sharma et\u00a0al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nAs a branch of self-efficacy, regulatory emotional self-efficacy refers to a degree of self-confidence of individuals in their emotion regulation ability, which affects the process of emotion regulation and is the basis of emotional competence (Bandura et\u00a0al., 2003). In other words, regulatory emotional self-efficacy is the expectation of behavioral subjects on their emotional regulation ability, which is based on self-evaluation and represents a cognitive state of one\u2019s ability. Research by Kavanagh and Bower (1985). showed that positive emotions are a significant predictor of selfefficacy. Research by Caprara et\u00a0 al. (2003). pointed out that individuals with higher self-efficacy in regulating negative emotions have higher levels of emotional stability.\nTaken together, emotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy appear to be\u00a0highly correlated in theory. On the one hand, emotional intelligence is the individual\u2019s ability to control emotions. To a certain extent, emotional intelligence provides a cognitive judgment for regulatory emotional self-efficacy and is the basis for regulatory emotional self-efficacy. While regulatory emotional self-efficacy seems to be\u00a0predicted by positive emotions, higher emotional intelligence also seems to predict higher positive emotions. Emotional intelligence seems to be\u00a0 a predictor of regulatory emotional self-efficacy. On the other hand, according to the related definition of resilience, self-efficacy is one of the protective factors in resilience, and higher resilience predicts higher positive emotions (Kumpfer, 2002). Therefore, regulatory emotional selfefficacy, which is also affected by positive emotions, seems to be\u00a0related to psychological resilience. In addition, a significant positive correlation between emotional intelligence and resilience has been demonstrated (Akbari and Khormaiee, 2015; Jayalakshmi and Magdalin, 2015). Based on this, this study proposes the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Resilience has a positive impact on regulatory emotional self-efficacy.\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Emotional intelligence has a positive impact on regulatory emotional self-efficacy.\nThe mediating roles of emotional intelligence and resilience\nAccording to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, positive emotions promote the establishment of various personal resources (e.g., material, intellectual, and social resources) by broadening the individual\u2019s ability to think and act, and then have an impact on the formation and development of an individual\u2019s personality (Fredrickson, 1998). It should be\u00a0pointed out that Fredrickson\u2019s previous research only clarified that positive emotions can have an impact on individual elements of an individual\u2019s personality such as creative thinking, cognitive ability, and resilience. But Fredrickson did not explain whether these factors interacted under the influence of positive emotions.\nPrevious research has demonstrated that emotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy may be\u00a0affected by positive emotions (Fredrickson, 2001). Based on this, it is the focus of this study to explore how they are affected by positive emotions and how they interact with each other.\nRelevant studies have demonstrated that physical activity could promote positive emotions in individuals, as there is a significant relationship between physical activity and emotional intelligence and a significant relationship between emotional intelligence and resilience (Jayalakshmi and Magdalin, 2015; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020). Thus, physical activity can have an impact on resilience through emotional intelligence. If there is a significant relationship between resilience and regulatory emotional selfefficacy, can emotional intelligence affect regulatory emotional self-efficacy? Assuming that physical activity, emotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy are all directly linked, can emotional intelligence and resilience mediate the relationship between physical activity and regulatory emotional self-efficacy? Based on this, this study proposes the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 4 (H4): Emotional intelligence mediates the relationship between physical activity and resilience.\nHypothesis 5 (H5): Resilience mediates the relationship between emotional intelligence and regulatory emotional self-efficacy.\nHypothesis 6 (H6): Emotional intelligence and resilience mediate the relationship between physical activity and regulatory emotional self-efficacy.\nA summary of all the hypotheses in this study is shown in Figure\u00a01."

These four scales were all measured using a five-point Likert scale, where responses ranged from 1 (i.e., strongly disagree) to 5 (i.e., strongly agree). All items are shown in Table\u00a01.\nTo adapt to the specific research field and Chinese cultural background, the researchers made certain adjustments to the items of the scales. A pilot test was used to ensure the reliability of the adjusted scale (Kimberlin and Winterstein, 2008). Taking the nurses of a municipal hospital as the survey object, the researchers distributed 60 questionnaires using the convenience sampling method and recovered 54 valid questionnaires. The results showed that Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients were all greater than 0.8, indicating that the measuring instruments had good internal consistency (Fornell and Larcker, 1981)."

Therefore, all variables have high convergent validity. Finally, the discriminant validity is verified by comparing the square root of AVE and the correlation coefficient of each variable.

According to previous research, scholars defined regulatory emotional self-efficacy as a cognitive judgment of one\u2019s emotion regulation ability. From this perspective, both the individual\u2019s internal cognitive ability and the influence of the external environment will affect the individual\u2019s cognitive state. Emotional intelligence, as the ability to perceive, use, understand and manage emotions, essentially exerts an influence on self-efficacy in emotion regulation by changing the individual\u2019s intrinsic cognitive ability to emotions. Mayer (2015). sees emotional intelligence as a mental ability, which is exactly in line with this point of view; while resilience affects regulatory emotional self-efficacy through an experiential environment from the outside world.\nPrevious studies on resilience found that individual resilience needs to be\u00a0 improved in the face of constant adversity, which is manifested as an empirical adaptation process. In other words, when different individuals face the same situation, individuals with similar experiences tend to have higher regulatory emotional self-efficacy. This study attempts to use an extended broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions to explain the effects of physical activity on emotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy. Positive emotions can motivate individuals to act to promote individuals to build material, intellectual, social, and other resources, among which intellectual resources are the focus of this research (Fredrickson, 1998). Positive emotions can promote the establishment of individual intellectual resources. From this point of view, emotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy, as important individual intellectual resources, may also be\u00a0 affected by positive emotions. Fredrickson\u2019s (2001) subsequent research confirmed this view by studying the impact of positive emotions on individual intellectual factors such as creative thinking, resilience, and cognitive ability. Based on this, this study used the extended broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions to explain the theoretical presuppositions among physical activity, emotional intelligence, resilience, and regulatory emotional self-efficacy."

This is very consistent with previous studies. The study by Sui et\u00a0al. (2021). has showed that regulatory emotional self-efficacy is an important mediator explaining the impact of nurses\u2019 personalities on COVID-19 pandemic-related negative emotions. However, unlike previous studies showing that physical activity can have a direct positive impact on selfefficacy, the positive effects of physical activity on emotionregulating self-efficacy in this study need to be\u00a0mediated entirely by mental resilience and emotional intelligence. This further\ndemonstrates the importance of positive emotions for the establishment of an individual\u2019s emotional capacity; building an individual\u2019s emotional competence requires a process, and the positive impact of physical activity on an individual\u2019s dynamic ability needs to be\u00a0transmitted through positive emotions, rather than directly affected by subjective feelings. This study demonstrates the positive effect of nurses\u2019 physical activity on regulatory emotional self-efficacy and the mechanism of action in the process. Therefore, the broader promotional effect of physical activity on an individual\u2019s physical and psychological levels deserves attention. For example, in the early days of COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, nurses and patients in field hospitals used exercise to reduce fatigue and enhance health. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai in the spring of 2022, exercise was also widely used by nurses and patients in various field hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses are often under tremendous physical and mental pressure as frontline workers in epidemic prevention and control. On the one hand, changes in the work environment and increased workload often make it difficult for them to adapt in a short period, which in turn creates physical and psychological stress (Alsaqri et\u00a0al., 2021). On the other hand, as mentioned above, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed nurses\u2019 work content, and the daily repetitive nucleic acid testing work has become their daily work. The dull and single-work content cannot give them get fun and a sense of achievement from their work. Meanwhile, alleviating the public\u2019s anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic often requires a lot of emotional labor. These factors make nurses prone to mental fatigue, which increases the risk of mental illness (Soylu et\u00a0al., 2021). From the results obtained, the physical benefits obtained by physical exercise in the nurse group also positively impacted the mental health of the nurse group. On the one hand, a muscular physique helps improve the individual\u2019s work and quality of life, and work and quality of life are the premises of ensuring the individual\u2019s mental health. On the other hand, the positive emotional experience obtained by the individual in physical activity can effectively relieve the emotional pressure generated by the individual, and the individual can enhance the emotional ability in the long-term positive emotional experience, which represents the enhancement of the individual\u2019s resistance to negative emotions, thereby improving the individual\u2019s mental health.\nHowever, despite the proven benefits of participating in physical activity, the level of physical participation of the public and special health-care workers is actually not high. This result can be\u00a0attributed to the following reasons. The public does not have a clear understanding of the benefits of sports participation. The conditions for providing public participation in sports activities, including venues, time, and sports instructors, are not sufficient. The atmosphere of public participation in sports is not strong enough. Based on this, this study puts forward the following suggestions for the nurses. To improve the awareness of nurses\u2019 participation in sports, the government and hospital management departments should carry out more publicity\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nactivities about the public\u2019s participation in sports activities (including the benefits of sports, exercise tips, exercise precautions). Hospitals should encourage nurses to develop the habit of participating in sports every day and provide conditions such as venue and time for nurses to participate in sports activities. Sports activities should be\u00a0regarded by hospitals as one of the most important components of cultural construction, and the purpose of improving nurses\u2019 participation in sports atmosphere is achieved by regularly organizing collective sports activities."

Specifically, the effect of physical activity on regulatory emotional self-efficacy was mediated by two variables: emotional intelligence and resilience. In the face of the severe pandemic in the world, nurses are often the type of group that suffers from greater physical and mental pressures. Considering that the current level of nurses\u2019 participation in sports is low, the government and hospital management departments should take corresponding measures to increase the level of physical activity of nurses."
