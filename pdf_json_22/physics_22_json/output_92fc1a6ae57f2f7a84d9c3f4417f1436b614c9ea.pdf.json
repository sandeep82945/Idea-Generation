    "abstractText": "This paper investigates on the theorization, design, fabrication and measurement of original phase shifter (PS) operating with two-step stair phase behavior. The innovative stair PS is designed with unfamiliar stop-band (SB) negative group delay (NGD) passive circuit. The elementary unfamiliar SB-NGD topology constituted by resistive, inductive, and capacitive lumped network is described. Acting as an RF and microwave circuit, the S-matrix model is expressed in function the RLC-network parameters. Thus, the canonical form of unfamiliar SB-NGD transfer function (TF) represented by the transmission coefficient is established. The unfamiliar SB-NGD circuit equations in terms of the NGD parameters are formulated. The established theory is validated comparing the calculated, simulated, and measured S-parameters and group delays (GDs). Results with a very good agreement showing unfamiliar SB-NGD behavior are observed around the central frequency 2.45 GHz and bandwidth of 100 MHz. An innovative application of unfamiliar SB-NGD function for the communication system front-end is developed. The developed application concept of unfamiliar SB-NGD circuit is illustrated by designing a microwave device operating as a PS presenting a two-step stair response completely original behavior. The basic theory, design and implementation of the two-step stair PS concept are introduced. To validate the two-step stair PS principle, a proof of concept (PoC) is designed based distributed element based inductive and capacitive microstrip elements. The simulated and measured results of the PS PoC are in good agreement. The experimental results confirm the feasibility of two-step stair PS with phase jumping from \u221270\u00b14 (from 2 GHz to 2.3 GHz) to \u2212104\u00b12 (from 2.6 GHz to 3.0 GHz). The investigated unfamiliar SB-NGD function-based stair PS is promising for future development 5G and 6G communication system.

INTRODUCTION The massive deployment of 5G technology constitutes a bridging step of future wireless communication. To meet\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Venkata Rajesh Pamula .\nthe expected users demand, innovative design of front-end RF and microwave circuit ensuring accurate performance of radiation pattern is necessary [1]. This radiation performance is essentially ensured with improvement of beamsteering antenna array design [2]\u2013[4]. Different antenna array topologies as adaptive [2] and coupled phased looped\nVOLUME 10, 2022 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

But these topologies need to be improved to suppress the RF impairment in massive antenna arrays [4]. To increase the compactness and linearity, an innovative topology of metamaterial-based array antenna was proposed [5], [6]. Such antenna arrays operate with linear metamaterial-based phase shifters [7].\nThe elaboration of negative refractive index (NRI) aspect of metamaterial was an inspiration for the emerging RF and microwave function operating with bandpass (BP) negative group delay (NGD) [8], [9]. The NRI structures are also known to operate with negative group velocity (NGV) effect. The metamaterial BP-NGD circuits were implemented with significantly lossy periodical cells [8], [9]. Therefore, RF and microwave engineers wondered curiously on the existence of BP-NGD circuit application. To answer, tentative applications were suggested [10]\u2013[24]. The BP-NGD function was introduced for adaptative aspect in a microwave signal processing building block [10]. Then, the NGD circuit was also proposed for the compensation of microwave devices [11].\nHowever, the natural NGD application is the group delay (GD) equalization [12]\u2013[14], which was proposed for the microwave signal RC-network based interconnects [12], [13] and also the BP filter GD rabbit ear reduction [14]. So far, the most developed application of unfamiliar BP-NGD function concerns the design of RF and microwave phase shifters (PSs) [15]\u2013[24]. The NGD PS was, recently, exploited to develop innovative topologies of antenna array operating with squint-free beamforming [15]\u2013[21]. This type of NGD antenna array application is fundamentally implemented with non-Foster elements using BP-NGD networks [17], [20], [21]. Another type of innovative application was the design of broadband PS using BP-NGD function operating independently to the frequency [22]\u2013[24].\nFurther innovative work inspired from this BP-NGD PS will be developed in the present paper. But before this point, it would be interesting to investigate more on the unfamiliar NGD function. Recent investigations from research teams [25]\u2013[32] confirm the diversity of BP-NGD topologies. The BP-NGD effect was verified with absorptive filter [25] and interference techniques [26]. A topology of BP-NGD active circuit was implemented by using microwave transversal filter approach [27]. The complexity leads some research works on the design of compact microwave passive circuits [28], [29]. More extensive microwave function aspect as the dual-band BP-NGD behavior was developed in [30]\u2013[33]. The dual-band NGD functions were also implemented with compact circuits [31], [32] and with multi-coupled lines [33].\nDespite the progressive state of the art on the BP-NGD circuit design, due to its unfamiliarity, curious questions are still raised by RF and microwave design engineers about the interpretation of the NGD effect. For a deep illustration, an analogy between the filter theory and the NGD function theory was addressed in [34]. Unlike the filter, the NGD function focuses mainly on the negative sign associated to the GD response and not to the magnitude response [34]\u2013[36]. Different types of NGD function\nare initiated and identified [35]\u2013[40]. The concept of lowpass (LP) NGD function was proposed in [35]. The BPNGD [8]\u2013[14], [20]\u2013[29], high-pass (HP) NGD [36]\u2013[38] and stop-band (SB) NGD [39], [40] RF passive circuits transformed from low-pass (LP) NGD cell are introduced.\nTable 1 addresses an overview on the state-of-the-art about the existing different types of NGD function which can be implemented either with passive or active circuits. It is important to note the dual-band NGD circuits as proposed in [30]\u2013[33] are completely and ideally different to the type of SB-NGD circuits.\nSo far most of available research work on the design of NGD circuits can be described as follows:\n\u2022 The simplest topologies are designed as LP-NGD type function [13], [34]\u2013[36]. For this type, the group delay (GD) is negative from DC to certain higher frequencies. \u2022 The BP-NGD type function containing lower and upper NGD cut-off frequencies aremainly designed for RF and microwave circuits [15]\u2013[34]. \u2022 By means of LP- to HP-NGD circuit transform, circuit theory showing few research works was performed are available about the design of HP-NGD function [36]\u2013[38]. \u2022 Then, very recent studies revealed the design feasibility of the most innovative types of NGD circuits which are classified as SB-NGD function [39], [40]. And deep investigation can be made for this last type of NGD circuit in order to develop some potential applications.\nFor this reason, the present paper investigates this SB-NGD function and introduces one of its original application for the design of stair phase microwave circuit. The paper is organized in six sections as follows:\n\u2022 Section II is focused on the unfamiliar SB-NGD topological description. The theoretical approach permitting the SB-NGD topological identification will be introduced. \u2022 Section III develops the S-matrix model of the identified SB-NGD passive cell. The analytical model in function of the RLC-network parameters constituting the unfamiliar SB-NGD cell will be established. The analytical investigation will be followed by the elaboration of the SB-NGD transfer function (TF) canonical form.\n1494 VOLUME 10, 2022\n\u2022 In Section IV, the SB-NGD analysis will be developed. Then, the synthesis design equation of circuit in function of the unfamiliar SB-NGD specifications will be formulated. \u2022 Section V is dedicated to the discussion on the unfamiliar SB-NGD function validation results. Comparison between calculated and simulated results of a proof of concept (PoC) will be discussed. \u2022 Section VI is the investigation on the design of stair PS prototype by using the unfamiliar SB-NGD circuit. The design principle of stair PS will be explained. An experimental validation example with a stair unfamiliar PS prototype will be treated. \u2022 Section VII is reserved to the conclusion of the paper.\nII. THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION ON UNFAMILIAR SB-NGD CIRCUIT UNDER CONSIDERATION This section describes the SB-NGD theory. The main specifications of unfamiliar SB-NGD function are defined. The identification approach of the passive topology based on RLC-lumped circuit will be investigated.\nA. ANALYTICAL DEFINITION OF SB-NGD FUNCTION Few research work and studies [39], [40] were made so far on the unfamiliar SB-NGD function. Despite the exiting results available in the literature, the existence of this innovative electronic function remains an open question for most of RF and microwave design, fabrication and test engineers. The present paragraph defines analytically the interpretation of the SB-NGD function. We suppose that the two-port black box microwave symmetric and passive system introduced in Fig. 1 is represented analytically by the S-matrix:\n[SNGD(s)] = [ S11(s) S21(s) S21(s) S11(s) ] . (1)\nwith s = \u03c9 is the Laplace variable expressed in function of angular frequency \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 f . We remind that the magnitude of the reflection and transmission coefficients are given by, respectively:\nS11(\u03c9) = |S11(j\u03c9)| (2)\nS21(\u03c9) = |S21(j\u03c9)| . (3)\nTo realize the SB-NGD analysis, the following frequency domain responses are essentially needed: \u2022 the phase of the transmission coefficient which is defined by:\n\u03d5(\u03c9) = arg [S21(j\u03c9)] (4)\n\u2022 the frequency dependent GD response which is defined by:\nGD(\u03c9) = \u2212 \u2202\u03d5(\u03c9) \u2202\u03c9 . (5)\nThis system is an NGD function if we can find an angular frequency, \u03c9x , where:\nGD(\u03c9x) < 0. (6)\nOne of specific types associated to NGD function is the SB-NGD concept. The ideal response of SB-NGD function can be represented by Fig. 2(a) by taking: \u2022 The cut-off angular frequencies, \u03c91 and \u03c92, as roots of equation:\nGD(\u03c9) = 0\u21d2 GD(\u03c91,2) = 0. (7)\n\u2022 The transmission coefficient ideal response is represented in Fig. 2(b) by:\nS21,NGD(\u03c91 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 \u03c92) = 1. (8)\nIn Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b): \u2022 the notation BWNGDL is used to denote the lower bandwidth,\n\u2022 and BWNGDH for higher bandwidth. Because of its counterintuitive originality, most of nonspecialist electronic and RF/microwave engineers confuse the filter and NGD functions. To avoid the misinterpretation, the\nVOLUME 10, 2022 1495\nfollowing subsection describes the differences between these two electronic functions.\nB. SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SB FILTER AND SB-NGD FUNCTION The present analytical illustration is based on the consideration of the frequency dependent parameters associated to filter and NGD functions:\n\u2022 reflection coefficient magnitudes, S11filter (f ) and S11NGD(f ), \u2022 transmission coefficient magnitudes, S21filter (f ) and S21NGD(f ), \u2022 and, GDs GDfilter (f ) and GDNGD(f ).\nThe lower and upper cut-off frequencies in the considered frequency bands are denoted, respectively: f1 = \u03c91 2\u03c0 f2 = \u03c92\n2\u03c0\n(9)\nwith f1 < f2. Thus, the comparison of the SB-NGD and filter behaviors and the associated specification can bemadewithin the frequency band operation bandwidth f [f1, f2]. In brief, the main difference between the classical \u2018\u2018stop-band\u2019\u2019 filter and the \u2018\u2018dual-band\u2019\u2019 NGD filter are based on which parameter is used to describe it. The classical filter uses the magnitude response of the transmission parameter, |S21(f )|, while, for instance, in the \u2018\u2018stop-band NGD function\u2019\u2019, it is defined by the NGD frequency band where the group delay meets the condition GD(f ) < 0 [34]. Different parameters related to the maximum GD of the filter and the maximum attenuation of NGD must be considered to characterize the functions.\nTo illustrate the identification of SB NGD topology, a general analytical approach will be elaborated in the following subsection.\nC. IDENTIFICATION APPROACH OF SB-NGD TOPOLOGY The identification approach of SB-NGD topology can be made by the analogy with the filter [34]. Substantially, we have identified the SB-NGD passive circuit from the lowpass (LP) NGD cell based on L-inductance. The elaboration of SB-NGD cell can be made from the equivalent impedance given by:\nZa(s) = Ls. (10)\nas the reactive element. As reported in [35] and [36], the passive cell constituted by an RL-series network mounted in parallel behaves as a LP-NGD first-order circuit presented in Fig. 3.\nWe can identify from this LP-NGD cell, the SB-NGD family by substituting the inductance L by an LC-parallel network. It yields the two-port circuit represented by the SB-NGD topology shown in Fig. 4. It acts as a second order circuit.\nFor this case, the equivalent impedance is given by:\nZb(s) = Ls\n1+ LCs2 . (11)\nTo analyze the identified SB-NGD cell, the S-matrix model is elaborated in the following section.\nIII. S-MATRIX MODEL AND TRANSFER FUNCTION (TF) CANONICAL FORM OF THE SB-NGD TOPOLOGY Similar to classical RF and microwave circuits, the theoretical analysis of the unfamiliar SB-NGD circuit will be based on the equivalent S-matrix model. Then, the SB-NGD canonical form will be established before the design equation formulation.\nThe S-matrix modelling of the SB-NGD topology under study will be described in the following paragraph.\nA. S-MATRIX MODEL OF THE SB-NGD TOPOLOGY Let us take the terminal reference impedance, R0 = 50 . We can demonstrate analytically that the impedance matrix of the SB-NGD topology shown in Fig. 3 is written as:\n[Z (s)] = [ R+ Zb(s) R+ Zb(s) R+ Zb(s) R+ Zb(s) ] . (12)\nAccording to the circuit and system theory, the associated S-matrix, introduced in equation (1), can be calculated from Z-to-S transform:\n[SNGD(s)] =  ( [Z (s)]\u2212 [ R0 0 0 R0 ]) \u00d7( [Z (s)]+ [ R0 0 0 R0 ])\u22121  . (13)\n1496 VOLUME 10, 2022\nTherefore, we establish the reflection and transmission coefficients, respectively, as:\nS11(s)= S22(s)= \u2212R0(1+ LCs2)\n2R+ R0 + 2Ls+ LC(2R+ R0)s2 (14)\nS21(s)= S12(s)= 2(R+ Ls+ RLCs2)\n2R+ R0 + 2Ls+ LC(2R+ R0)s2 . (15)\nThe corresponding SB-NGD analysis is mainly focused on the last expression as described in the next paragraph.\nB. CANONICAL FORM OF SB-NGD TF The TF associated to the SB-NGD topology is generally represented by the transmission coefficient:\nT (s) = S21(s). (16)\nLet us denote the center angular frequency of the positive GD (PGD) as:\n\u03c90 = 2\u03c0 f0 (17)\nwhere:\nT (\u03c9 = \u03c90) = |S21(j\u03c9)|\u03c9=\u03c90 = 1. (18)\nThen, we denote also the following NGD key parameters, GD value and the transmission coefficient, respectively:\n\u03c4n = GD(\u03c90) (19)\nTn = |S21(j\u03c9)|\u03c9=0 = S21(\u03c9 = 0). (20)\nWith the real positive parameter, Tn < 1, the SB-NGD TF canonical form can be expressed as:\nT (s) = Tn(s2 + \u03c9as+ \u03c920)\ns2 + \u03c9bs+ \u03c920 (21)\nwhere:\n\u03c9a = 2(1\u2212 Tn) Tn\u03c4n\n(22)\n\u03c9b = 2(1\u2212 Tn)\n\u03c4n . (23)\nBy identification with the transmission coefficient expressed in equation (15), we have:\nTn = 2R\n2R+ R0 (24)\n\u03c90 = 1 \u221a LC\n(25)\n\u03c4n = R0C = R0 L\u03c92n > 0. (26)\nIn this case, the reflection coefficient proposed in equation (14) can then be rewritten as:\nS11(s) = (Tn \u2212 1)(s2 + \u03c920)\ns2 + \u03c9bs+ \u03c920 . (27)\nKnowing the S-matrix model, the frequency responses will be analyzed in the following subsection.\nC. ANALYSIS OF S-PARAMETER FREQUENCY RESPONSES The magnitudes of the reflection and transmission coefficients, S11(\u03c9) = |S11(j\u03c9)| and T (\u03c9) = |T (j\u03c9)| are given, respectively, by:\nS11(\u03c9) = \u2223\u2223(1\u2212 Tn)(\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c920)\u2223\u2223\u221a \u03c4 2n (\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c9 2 0) 2 + 4(\u03c9 \u2212 Tn\u03c90)2 (28)\nT (\u03c9) =\n\u221a (Tn\u03c4n)2(\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c920)\n2 + 4(\u03c9 \u2212 Tn\u03c90)2\u221a \u03c4 2n (\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c9 2 0) 2 + 4(\u03c9 \u2212 Tn\u03c90)2 . (29)\nThe transmission phase yielded from the transmission coefficient is expressed as:\n\u03d5(\u03c9) = \u03d5$ (\u03c9)\u2212 \u03d5\u03d1 (\u03c9) (30)\nwith:\n\u03d5$ (\u03c9) = arctan\n[ 2(Tn \u2212 1)\u03c9\nTn\u03c4n(\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c920)\n] (31)\nand:\n\u03d5\u03d1 (\u03c9) = arctan\n[ 2(1\u2212 Tn)\u03c9\n\u03c4n(\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c920)\n] . (32)\nThe SB-NGD analysis can be explored from these expressions.\nIV. SB-NGD ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS OF THE IDENTIFIED RLC-NETWORK BASED TOPOLOGY The NGD analysis consists in the identification of the NGD existence condition written in equation (6), in the appropriated frequency bands. The NGD condition can be transformed into a relation between the elements of the topology under study by considering the GD expressed in equation (5). Subsequently, to explore this condition, we need to start with the GD expression versus frequency.\nA. FREQUENCY DEPENDENT EXPRESSION OF GD The GD defined in equation (5), which takes into account the transmission phase written in equation (30), is expressed as:\nGD(\u03c9) = GD\u03d1 (\u03c9)\u2212 GD$ (\u03c9) (33)\nor\nGD(\u03c9) = \u2202\u03d5\u03d1 (\u03c9) \u2202\u03c9 \u2212 \u2202\u03d5$ (\u03c9) \u2202\u03c9\n(34)\nwith\nGD$ (\u03c9)= 2\u03c4n(1\u2212 Tn)(\u03c92 + \u03c920)\n\u03c4 2n (\u03c94 + \u03c9 4 0)+ 2 [ 2(1\u2212 Tn)2 \u2212 \u03c4 2n\u03c9 2 0 ] \u03c92 (35)\nGD\u03d1 (\u03c9)= 2\u03c4nTn(Tn \u2212 1)(\u03c92 + \u03c920)\nT 2n \u03c4 2n (\u03c94 + \u03c9 4 0)+ 2 [ 2(1\u2212 Tn)2 \u2212 T 2n \u03c4 2n\u03c9 2 0 ] \u03c92\n(36)\nThe exploration of this GD constitutes the SB-NGD analysis and synthesis to be developed in the next subsection.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 1497\nB. ANALYSIS AT VERY LOW FREQUENCIES (\u03c9 \u2248 0) We recall that at very low frequencies, \u03c9 \u2248 0, the reflection and transmission coefficients of equations (28) and (29) become: {\nS11(\u03c9 = 0) = 1\u2212 Tn S21(\u03c9 = 0) = Tn\n(37)\nAt the same frequency, the GD introduced in equation (31) is simplified as:\nGD(\u03c9 \u2248 0) = \u22122(1\u2212 Tn)2\nTn\u03c4n\u03c920 < 0. (38)\nFor the interpretation of this relation, the mapping of the product:\n\u03ba = GD(f \u2248 0)\u00d7 GD(f \u2248 f0) (39)\nversus (f0,Tn) varied from (0.5 GHz, \u221210 dB) to (5 GHz, \u22121 dB) is presented in Figs. 5. It can be seen that the product \u03ba is inversely proportional to fn and Tn. As an interesting remark inferred from the plot of Figs. 5:\n\u2022 when fn increases from 0.5 GHz to 1.5 GHz, the product, \u03ba , decreases from about \u22120.3 ns2 to \u2212299 ps2, \u2022 and when the characteristic frequency varies from 1.5 GHz to 5 GHz, the product, \u03ba , decreases from\u22120.03 ns2 to \u221226.9 ps2.\nC. EXPRESSION OF SB-NGD BANDWIDTH We can remark that the GD established in equation (38) is always negative for any values of parameters in the topology proposed in Fig. 4. Moreover, the NGD cut-off frequencies can be determined as the roots of equation (7) by using theGD given in (33). Consequently, we find the cut-off frequencies\ngiven by:\n\u03c91 =\n\u221a 2(Tn \u2212 1)2 + Tn(\u03c4n\u03c90)2 + 2\u03b6 (1\u2212 Tn)\n\u03c4n \u221a Tn\n(40)\n\u03c92 =\n\u221a 2(Tn \u2212 1)2 + Tn(\u03c4n\u03c90)2 \u2212 2\u03b6 (1\u2212 Tn)\n\u03c4n \u221a Tn\n(41)\nwhere:\n\u03b6 = \u221a (Tn \u2212 1)2 + Tn(\u03c4n\u03c90)2. (42)\nThe bandwidth with positive GD (PGD) can be calculated with the relation:\nBW = \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c91. (43)\nD. PROPERTIES OF SB-NGD FUNCTION Similar to the cases of themost developed types of NGD function as LP-NGD and BP-NGD ones, the SB-NGD function presents some specific analytical properties. It is interesting to note that the cut-off frequencies and PGD center frequency are linked by the equation:\n\u03c92\u03c91\n\u03c920\n= 1. (44)\nIn addition to this relationship, we remind also that: \u2022 At the central frequency According to equation (18), the magnitude T (\u03c9 = \u03c90) = 1 and the GD at the is equal to GD(\u03c90) = \u03c4n > 0.\n\u2022 At very low frequency, the magnitude as given in equation (35) must be T (\u03c9 \u2248 0) < 1 and the GD at very low frequency GD(\u03c9 \u2248 0) < 0.\nIn brief, the passive circuit introduced in Fig. 4 enables to have:  GD(\u03c9 < \u03c91) < 0 GD(\u03c91 < \u03c9 < \u03c92) > 0 GD(\u03c9 > \u03c92) < 0 (45)\nThis statement confirms that the circuit introduced in Fig. 4 behaves as a SB-NGD function.\nE. SYNTHESIS AND DESIGN EQUATIONS OF SB-NGD CIRCUIT The design of the SB-NGD circuit must start with the specifications of: \u2022 The PGD center frequency, \u03c4n, \u2022 The attenuation at very low frequency, Tn, \u2022 The expected PGD, \u03c4n, which is linked with the NGD at very low frequency, \u03c40 = GD0 < 0, given in equation (36).\nTherefore, the equations of the SB-NGD circuit R, L, and C parameters are given by:\nR = TnR0\n2(1\u2212 Tn) (46)\nL = R0 \u03c4n\u03c9 2 0\n(47)\n1498 VOLUME 10, 2022\nWe can remind that Tn must verify the condition, 0 < Tn < 1. The different ranges of R, L, and C values versus (Tn, \u03c4n) are plotted in Figs. 6. According to these graphical plots, it can be seen that: \u2022 R increases with Tn, L varies inversely proportional to Tn and \u03c4n, and C increases proportionally to \u03c4n.\n\u2022 The R-variation slope is particularly weak, lower than 10 /dB, when Tn is below \u22126 dB, against the slope above \u22124 dB, which is more than 100 /dB. \u2022 The C-variation presents a slope less than 10 pF/decade when \u03c4n is lower than 1 ns against more than 100 pF/decade when \u03c4n is higher than 1 ns. Table 2 summarizes the minimal and maximal values of R, L, and C versus the considered minimal and maximal range of (Tn, \u03c4n).\nTo verify the feasibility of the developed SB-NGD theory, PoC practical investigation will be presented in the next section.\nV. VERIFICATION RESULTS WITH PROOF OF CONCEPT (POC) CIRCUIT OF SB-NGD TOPOLOGY The present section deals with the validations of the SB-NGD topology. After the PoC description, parametric simulations are described in order to quantify the influence of the R,\nL, and C component parameters on the NGD behavior. The overall validation aspects are originally focused on analyzing NGD function.\nA. POC DESIGN DESCRIPTION The SB-NGD circuit design was performed with the application of synthesis equations of R, L, and C expressed in equations (46), (47), and (48), respectively. Fig. 7 shows the design of the SB-NGD schematic circuit in the environment of the electronic and RF/microwave circuit simulator ADS R\u00a9 from Keysight Technologies. The NGD specifications and designed circuit electrical parameters are indicated in Table 3.\nTo illustrate the robustness of the SB-NGD behavior, sensitivity analysis with respect to the circuit parameters will be discussed in the following subsection.\nB. SB-NGD RESPONSE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Sensitivity analyses with respect to the resistor, R+/\u22125%, inductor, L+/\u22125%, and capacitor, C+/\u22125%, have been conducted for the robustness of the SB-NGD circuit. The sensitivity analyses enable to explain more explicitly the circuit parameter effects onto the SB-NGD function. The MATLAB R\u00a9 calculations of GD, S11, and S21 introduced in equation (33), equation (28), and equation (29) to be discussed in the following paragraphs with the S-parameter analytical expressions, are carried out from 2 GHz to 3 GHz.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 1499"

COMPARISON OF SB NGD SPECIFICATIONS The present subsection proposes a state-of-the-art investigation about the unfamiliar SB NGD function. We can compare the specifications of the considered NGD circuit with the very few research works available in the literature about the SB NGD circuit design [36], [39], [40]. Table 5 summarizes the comparison of NGD at center frequency fo, GD \u03c4 (fo) at the center frequency, bandwidth BW and also the attenuation at center frequency.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 1501\nThe present research work is particularly challenging with the possibility of SB-NGD circuit design operating at higher central frequency with very low attenuation loss.\nAt this stage, we may wonder about the designability of SB NGD integrating into a PS. The following section develops the innovative stair PS design, fabrication and test of the proof of concept.\nVI.

Table 7 summarizes the stair PS specifications.\nA good correlation of stair phase values can be underlined with the measured one: \u2022 In the first bandwidth, BWL = 2-2.3 GHz, where we have a phase shift of \u221270\u25e6\u00b14\u25e6.\n\u2022 In the 2nd bandwidth, BWH = 2.6-3.0 GHz, the step phase is shifted to \u2212104\u25e6\u00b12\u25e6.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 1505\nFurthermore, the associated reflection and transmission coefficients of the stair PS PoC are plotted in Fig. 23. They show a good access matching between the two bands (BWL and BWH ) and the PS flatness transmission coefficient less than 3 dB through the whole range (2-3 GHz).\nVII. CONCLUSION An original theory of SB-NGD circuit is presented. The proposed SB-NGD passive topology was inspired from the LP-NGD cell and the LP-to-SB circuit transform. The S-parameter model is established for the NGD analysis. The different properties of the SB-NGD function are developed.\nTo confirm the feasibility of the SB-NGD theory, a circuit PoC has been designed and simulated. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the constituting lumped component parameters are performed. It was reported how the SB-NGD response can be sensitivity to the three circuit parameters. An example of SB-NGD circuit application is developed to design a stair PS function with phase shift independent to the frequency. The principle of the stair PS is introduced. Simulations and experimentations illustrate the feasibility of the SB-NGD circuit-based stair PS in two frequency bandwidths.\nThe present research result is a pioneering work about the design of the future communication system. In this optic, the developed stair PS concept can be useful in the future for designing phase array system of innovative multi-beam antenna for the improvement of RF and microwave system control [41].\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
