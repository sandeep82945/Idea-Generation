    "abstractText": "Recently, we initiated a new research line on fulfillment in life by developing a conceptual framework and a self-report measure. To enhance conceptual clarity and complement theoretical considerations and empirical findings, we investigated lay conceptions of a fulfilled life in German-speaking participants at different life stages. First, we selected a qualitative approach using an open-ended question asking participants to describe a fulfilled life. Second, for a more comprehensive understanding, quantitative data were collected about the relevance of sources in providing fulfillment and ratings on a fulfilling life in the present and a fulfilled life in retrospect. Qualitative content analysis was used to assess the responses to the open-ended question. One-fifth of the data was double coded, and intercoder reliability was high (Kappa = 0.89). Responses comprised a variety of descriptions, and we grouped them into seven themes, three of which overlapped with the prior conceptualization, namely the core elements of (a) general description, (b) cognitive appraisals, and (c) affective appraisals. Cognitive evaluations related to intrapersonal aspects, particularly having lived life fully, attained personally significant goals, and developed oneself, as well as interpersonal, generative aspects, such as having made a contribution and been able to leave something of value. These categories are mostly in line with what the Fulfilled Life Scale (FLS) measures. Further themes referred to correlates\u2014 including (d) sources\u2014and antecedents, including (e) resources, (f) personal characteristics, and (g) quality of life, all considered worthy to be the subject of empirical investigation but which were not included in the conceptual model. Qualitative and quantitative results suggest that individuals derive fulfillment from different sources. Fulfillment from a profession and having a life task was strongly associated with longer-term fulfillment. Only a few age and sex differences were found. The overarching framework developed from the qualitative results can stimulate further investigation. Our findings underscore that a fulfilled life as a distinct construct should be measured directly rather than via a proxy. Insights into the constituents, sources, and antecedents of a fulfilled life can inform practice to promote a life well lived.",

A mixed methods study on lay perspectives across the lifespan Doris\u00a0Baumann * and Willibald\u00a0Ruch\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland\nRecently, we\u00a0initiated a new research line on fulfillment in life by developing\na conceptual framework and a self-report measure. To enhance conceptual\nclarity and complement theoretical considerations and empirical findings,\nwe\u00a0 investigated lay conceptions of a fulfilled life in German-speaking\nparticipants at different life stages. First, we\u00a0selected a qualitative approach\nusing an open-ended question asking participants to describe a fulfilled life.\nSecond, for a more comprehensive understanding, quantitative data were\ncollected about the relevance of sources in providing fulfillment and ratings\non a fulfilling life in the present and a fulfilled life in retrospect. Qualitative\ncontent analysis was used to assess the responses to the open-ended\nquestion. One-fifth of the data was double coded, and intercoder reliability\nwas high (Kappa = 0.89). Responses comprised a variety of descriptions, and\nwe\u00a0 grouped them into seven themes, three of which overlapped with the\nprior conceptualization, namely the core elements of (a) general description,\n(b) cognitive appraisals, and (c) affective appraisals. Cognitive evaluations\nrelated to intrapersonal aspects, particularly having lived life fully, attained\npersonally significant goals, and developed oneself, as well as interpersonal,\ngenerative aspects, such as having made a contribution and been able to\nleave something of value. These categories are mostly in line with what the\nFulfilled Life Scale (FLS) measures. Further themes referred to correlates\u2014\nincluding (d) sources\u2014and antecedents, including (e) resources, (f) personal\ncharacteristics, and (g) quality of life, all considered worthy to be\u00a0the subject of\nempirical investigation but which were not included in the conceptual model.\nQualitative and quantitative results suggest that individuals derive fulfillment\nfrom different sources. Fulfillment from a profession and having a life task\nwas strongly associated with longer-term fulfillment. Only a few age and\nsex differences were found. The overarching framework developed from the\nqualitative results can stimulate further investigation. Our findings underscore\nthat a fulfilled life as a distinct construct should be\u00a0measured directly rather\nthan via a proxy. Insights into the constituents, sources, and antecedents of a\nfulfilled life can inform practice to promote a life well lived.\nKEYWORDS\nfulfilled life, fulfillment, a good life, lay perspectives, lifespan, positive aging, mixed methods approach, positive psychology\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 30 September 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.982782"

            "text": "Understanding what entails a fulfilling life and how to enhance it can be\u00a0seen as a core mission in positive psychological research (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; Seligman, 2002). Until recently, however, a conceptual definition and a systematic investigation of the construct of fulfillment in life have been absent. To close this gap and initiate research, we\u00a0 introduced a theoretical framework of fulfillment in life (Baumann and Ruch, 2021) and an instrument to measure a fulfilled life in retrospect (Baumann and Ruch, 2022). Yet, the question of the extent to which individuals share the proposed scientific concept remains unanswered. Specifically, how do people themselves define a fulfilled life? What does a fulfilled life contain in lay people\u2019s views? Indeed, it was argued that studying a phenomenon only from the outside is insufficient and that the lay perspective must also be\u00a0considered (Furnham, 1988; Park and Peterson, 2007). Particularly in the early stages of a new research line, this information appears to be\u00a0critical to understanding a concept and complementing theoretical perspectives (Delle Fave et\u00a0 al., 2011). Since research on fulfillment is only just beginning, it is crucial to establish what the term means to laypersons.\nPrior to our work in clarifying the concept and meaning of fulfillment (Baumann and Ruch, 2021), the term was used merely as a synonym for well-being (e.g., Seligman, 2011) or as an umbrella term for positive outcomes that constitute the good life (e.g., Lopez and Snyder, 2003; Peterson and Seligman, 2004). Concepts of a good life and well-being have been operationalized in various ways (for an overview, see Huta and Waterman, 2014), such as life satisfaction (Diener et\u00a0al., 1985), psychological well-being (e.g., Ryff, 1989), orientations to well-being (Peterson et\u00a0al., 2005; Seligman, 2011), eudaimonic well-being (Waterman et\u00a0 al., 2010), or flourishing (e.g., Keyes, 2005; SchotanusDijkstra et\u00a0 al., 2016). Ryan and Deci (2000, 2001) provided another perspective with their self-determination theory (SDT) by describing the conditions that promote intrinsic motivation and well-being. To maintain self-actualization and healthy functioning throughout the lifespan, the three psychological nees for competency, autonomy, and relatedness must be satisfied. Although several approaches to the good life have emerged, a scientific approach to fulfillment in life has been lacking until recently. In this study, we aim to address the gap in the literature regarding lay conceptions of a fulfilled life. In this article, we\u00a0 first briefly introduce the multidimensional conceptualization of fulfillment in life and the recently developed and validated Fulfilled Life Scale (FLS; Baumann and Ruch, 2022). Second, to help locate the construct within a broader conceptual framework, we\u00a0 offer a brief review of findings from studies on lay conceptualizations, in which participants mentioned fulfillment as part of well-being concepts. In sum, although studies of lay conceptions have not yet examined fulfillment in life, there are few in which the term appears in the context of happiness and well-being."

            "text": "In our theoretical conceptualization, we\u00a0defined fulfillment in life as \u201ca cognitive-affective experience referring to a sense of wholeness, fit, and value toward the self, one\u2019s life, and one\u2019s impact\u201d (Baumann and Ruch, 2021, p.\u00a0 6). The subjective experience consists of both cognitive-evaluative appraisals and affect. The cognitive component is represented in the Fulfillment in Life model (FiL), which is construed as a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix that includes criteria for fulfillment (wholeness, congruence, worthwhileness) and sources of fulfillment (self, life, impact/ legacy), yielding nine cognitive facets. In terms of the whole lived life, \u201ca fulfilled life refers to the positive appraisal of the person one has become, how one has led one\u2019s life, and the impact one has made\u201d (Baumann and Ruch, 2022, p.\u00a02). The three criteria related to the self refer to the fulfillment derived from having made something of one\u2019s potentialities, having been true to oneself, and having used one\u2019s capabilities meaningfully. Combining the criteria with the source life describes fulfillment that comes from having lived fully and led a life that deeply suited one and has been worthwhile. The three criteria related to impact and legacy mean that one could make a positive difference in others\u2019 lives, that one made contributions that reflected one\u2019s values, and that one felt that one\u2019s life mattered to others. The affective experience consists of positive low-arousal feelings, such as harmony, inner peace, deep inner contentment, or great gratitude (Baumann and Ruch, 2021). In addition, a fulfilled life is primarily free of deep regret, disappointment, and feelings of emptiness.\nWe proposed fulfillment in life as the generic term and distinguished between different time frames, ranging from a short-term to a long-term perspective. The four time frames differentiate between fulfillment in an activity, fulfillment in a role or life area, a fulfilling life encompassing the whole life at the present life stage, and a fulfilled life that, in retrospect, encompasses the whole lived life.\nThe outlined conceptualization served as the basis for developing the multidimensional FLS (Baumann and Ruch, 2022), which assesses the whole life in retrospect. Based on the data of two samples of 688 adults aged 40\u201393, we\u00a0found that the nine cognitive facets can be\u00a0measured independently and were highly reliable. Their intercorrelation indicated a structure with fewer factors and permitted the creation of an economic version. Through factor analyses, three factors were identified that were clear and easily interpretable. The final scale contains 24 items for the three cognitive dimensions and eight items for the affective experience of fulfillment:\nUnfolded Self and Life items assess the perception that one has been able to develop, grow, be\u00a0authentic, and live a full and true life (e.g., \u201cI have had the courage to be\u00a0as I\u00a0really am.\u201d)\nPositive Impact and Legacy items measure the extent to which one has been able to positively impact the lives of others and live a life that mattered to the well-being of others (e.g., \u201cI could make a positive contribution to other people\u2019s welfare.\u201d)\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nThe Worthwhile Life items assess the perception that one\u2019s pursuits have been worthwhile and that one has lived life well (e.g., \u201cI have the certainty that I\u00a0have lived for the right things.\u201d)\nFulfilled Life Affective Experience items assess the presence of positive feelings related to the lived life (e.g., \u201cI feel deep inner contentment.\u201d) and the absence of negative emotions (\u201cI feel rather empty.\u201d\u2014reverse scored).\nFindings revealed that cognitive and affective fulfillment were needed to significantly increase the ability to predict a global fulfillment rating, which could not be\u00a0sufficiently predicted by existing well-being measures. The scales were associated with several sociodemographic and contextual variables, including age, education, financial status, marital status, spirituality, self-rated health, or a good childhood experience."

            "text": "Prior research revealed that laypersons mention the term fulfillment in the context of conceptions of happiness and wellbeing. To our knowledge, fulfillment appeared in three studies that used an open-ended question or were in the form of sentence completion questions, and involved mature-aged persons (Ryff, 1989; Westerhof et\u00a0al., 2001; Delle Fave et\u00a0al., 2011). In the first study with a cross-national sample, fulfillment was cited in psychological definitions alongside other constructs such as harmony, emotions, well-being, achievement, or satisfaction (Delle Fave et\u00a0 al., 2011); it was not used synonymously but considered to be\u00a0unique. The second study demonstrated that laypersons use fulfillment for global life evaluations that include meanings not covered by life satisfaction (Westerhof et\u00a0al., 2001). In both studies, half of the statements referred to specific and contextual dimensions (e.g., interpersonal relationships, health, standard of living, or spirituality). Only in the third study was fulfillment described in more detail. Ryff (1989) examined conceptions of well-being among middle-aged and older individuals, with two questions related to what personal fulfillment and being unfilled mean. With respect to personal fulfillment, respondents in both age groups most frequently cited a sense of accomplishment and second most frequently stated enjoying life. Other themes included contributing, being a caring person, and having a good family life. Regrets were the most frequently mentioned theme regarding lack of fulfillment in both age groups. Besides, participants equated lack of fulfillment with unhappiness, loneliness, an empty life, no career, and not realizing talent. No significant age or sex differences were found in responses to these two questions. Although the concept of personal fulfillment is narrower than that of fulfillment in life, most of the components mentioned by participants are covered in the proposed conceptualization of Baumann and Ruch (2021).\nIn summary, when asked to define happiness or well-being, laypersons mentioned fulfillment as a separate concept and\nconsidered fulfillment for evaluating their lives as a whole. However, what laypersons mean by a fulfilled life remains to be\u00a0clarified. Therefore, our aim is to study people\u2019s ideas of a fulfilled life to advance conceptual clarity. To this purpose, we\u00a0will use an open-ended question that allows respondents to express in their own words what a fulfilled life means to them. Participants will be\u00a0asked to give a description of their most telling example of a fulfilled life, regardless of what their life is like. To gain different types of information about the conceptions and experiences of a fulfilled life, we\u00a0will employ a convergent mixed methods design. This ensures greater depth and diversity of responses than a purely quantitative approach. Furthermore, the mixed methods approach permits us to obtain and compare different perspectives from qualitative and quantitative data and gain a more comprehensive knowledge of the construct than would be\u00a0possible with an isolated method (Creswell, 2014). Findings can help expand the understanding of the nature of a fulfilled life, strengthen theory-building and empirical research, and be\u00a0 relevant to practice. For individuals, clues to the characteristics of a fulfilled life can help set the right course at a younger age or initiate midlife corrections to focus on what is deemed valuable and successful in a final life review. In addition, a knowledge of sources of fulfillment can guide people in creating a more fulfilling life by engaging in and cultivating specific activities and roles. Furthermore, professionals (e.g., coaches, counselors) working with individuals in a particular life stage can benefit from a nuanced knowledge of their target group\u2019s subjective perspective."

During the coding process, the coders were not informed about the personal characteristics behind the data. Qualitative analysis was performed with MAXQDA software. After familiarizing herself with the data, the principal investigator assigned codes to a part of the data through an inductive process and developed a hierarchical coding frame. Code memos were used to define the meaning and content of a code and to differentiate it from others. The codes were sorted into subcategories and categories, and themes were generated for the underlying meaning of the categories. It became apparent that participants mentioned not only elements of a fulfilled life, but also prerequisites and sources. Therefore, statements were examined according to this differentiation. For instance, when an individual mentioned the topic of partnership, we\u00a0 inspected whether the person meant the fulfillment drawn from this role (source of fulfillment) or the aspect of a fulfilled life in having attained a vital life goal (e.g., having found a partner, having a long-lasting relationship). Regarding contentment, we\u00a0 tried to distinguish whether participants meant the feeling or the evaluation. Satisfaction with one\u2019s professional achievements was treated as an evaluation, while becoming a contented person or inner contentment was considered as affect.\nThe principal investigator trained the second coder and explained the coding frame. Then the second coder analyzed the set with the uncoded a priori defined data units. Subcategories, categories, and themes were examined and were evaluated regarding consistency. The principal investigator and the second coder reviewed and discussed deviations until a consensus was established to ensure the discriminatory power of the categories and to improve the coding frame. Afterward, the principal investigator coded a larger data subset. The second coder again received a data set with uncoded data to apply the codes. To assess intercoder reliability, we\u00a0calculated a chance-corrected coefficient, which was high, Kappa = 0.89. For any discrepancies found, the cases\nwere discussed until an agreement was achieved. The principal investigator coded the remaining data."

These are not necessarily financial successes, but rather inconspicuous things that perhaps only in retrospect turned out to be\u00a0successes. Or paths despised by others, which one wanted to follow at all costs, which did not bring one to the planned goal, but perhaps to an unplanned, much greater goal.\u201d (Female, 52)\nThis category comprised two subcategories divided into socially and professionally successful. Social success related to having been able to find a partner, start a family, have a happy family, build a solid and long-lasting circle of friends and good relationships, and see the positive development of the offspring:\n\u201cSo, for example, three healthy, intelligent and satisfied children, whom you\u00a0have raised to become capable human beings and valuable members of society, is a symbol of a fulfilled life for me as a mother. If one has managed to maintain one\u2019s partnership through ups and downs and to one\u2019s own satisfaction, if one has struggled and suffered and yet is still together, then that is a symbol of fulfilled life for me.\u201d (Female, 54)\nProfessional success was mentioned in general terms and was also described as satisfaction with what has been achieved professionally and having attained in one\u2019s career what one wanted. Developed self was another major category within the cognitive appraisals referring to how a person could learn, develop, and grow. It describes a person\u2019s ability to make progress in various areas, learn from mistakes, experiment, develop and use strengths, and redefine oneself:\n\u201cI have become closer and closer to the person I\u00a0want to be.\u201d (Female, 30)\nParticipants considered a contribution and legacy as part of a fulfilled life. This category suggests that a positive impact on the lives of others can take many forms. For example, respondents\u2019 statements related to having raised children, having left an asset that generates profit across generations, and being able to look back on grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Having passed on learnings from one\u2019s life and what is essential for a good life were also mentioned. Other descriptions included having done something meaningful and valuable for society and the environment, helped people, given back, and supported persons vital to oneself:\n\u201cOne has left traces. One has moved the world, even if only in small pieces.\u201d (Male, 54)\nThe category of having mastered life was composed of three subcategories. The first was having mastered difficult life phases, including having coped with crises and overcome low points in life:\n\u201cA fulfilling life includes difficulties that had to be\u00a0overcome. Without the endangerment of the circumstances recognized as valuable, I\u00a0as a human being could not feel the emptiness as a counter design, from which a fulfilling life stands out.\u201d (Male, 34)\nThe second subcategory emphasized having made the best out of life events, situations, and setbacks and the knowledge of this. The third subcategory referred to recognized redemption, in perceiving that adversity turned into something good, a painful experience produced a strong sense of justice, or something that one would have chosen differently turned out well. Another category pertained to recognizing meaning and purpose. It described the perception that one has fulfilled one\u2019s purpose in life, had a life task, and\u2014in retrospect\u2014recognized meaning in everything, including one\u2019s actions:\n\u201cSo, the certainty of having led a meaningful life.\u201d (Male, 44)\nThe category referring to a suited life entailed the feeling of having been true to oneself, having made good decisions, having taken the right path in life, and having pursued one\u2019s own ideas and interests, as well as having found ways to combine and apply them with their talents. Within the category having lived according to own values, statements described specific values that one would like to see realized. These include that one could be\u00a0 there for others, having been a role model for others, having acted morally right for oneself, or having lived honestly. The other two categories within cognitive appraisals were gained better self-knowledge, i.e., seeing oneself and one\u2019s inclinations, weaknesses, and strengths more clearly, and meaningful use of talents and resources, which describes a fulfilled life in which one did not waste time and energy, but feels one has used them properly."

Moreover, a sense of meaning is achieved by creating an evolving and coherent life story; McAdams (2001) refers to this as narrative identity. Lay perspectives referred to both cognitive and affective appraisals, with more statements referring to the cognitive aspects. From this, we\u00a0 can conclude that the evaluation of whether life is fulfilled is based on different criteria. Hence, the cognitive core elements reveal what counts for people to arrive at this conclusion, and the affective elements indicate the feelings involved. Laypersons consider a fulfilled life primarily as a fully lived life, as evidenced by the frequency of statements. It describes the richness of a lived life, chances taken, or a life led consciously. Such a life points to the depth (richness) and the degree of realization and completeness. From the lay perspective, almost as relevant for a fulfilled life is that personally significant goals have been attained. As regards the specificity of goals, participants notably stated the attainment of social and professional goals. The emphasis lies on the meaningfulness and value of these goals. Life appears enriched, rewarding, and complete through having been able to build a family, maintain long-lasting relationships, or look back on a successful career. Another central facet of a fulfilled life was that one could develop and evolve as a person. In a previous study, failure to realize talent was equated with a lack of fulfillment (Ryff, 1989). Contributing and leaving something of value for others constituted an additional core feature. This finding demonstrated that a fulfilled life is not a self-centered life but emerges from being able to transcend self-interest and develop the virtue of care (Erikson, 1985; Ryff, 1989). The fulfillment that comes from promoting the welfare of others might be\u00a0based on the values of universalism and benevolence, which belong to the value type of selftranscendence described in Schwartz\u2019s (1994) value theory. In comparison to the life evaluation operationalized as life satisfaction, a fulfilled life includes the contentment of positively impacting upon others\u2019 lives. Recognizing meaning in life and perceiving the resulting good were addressed as part of a fulfilled life. Furthermore, participants viewed a fulfilled life as a life that has suited and was lived according to one\u2019s standards. A life judged as fulfilled also seems to depend on whether one could master difficult life phases and make the best of adverse events, which was mentioned more frequently by women than by men.\nLaypersons referred to an affective side of a fulfilled life by describing different feelings. One of these was inner peace and harmony, an aspect mentioned in a previous study on people\u2019s happiness (Delle Fave et\u00a0 al., 2011). Participants mentioned contentment in the context of affective experience on the one hand, but also for evaluation purposes. In coding, we\u00a0attempted to differentiate accordingly. In addition, participants suggested that a fulfilled life went along with feelings of gratitude. It should largely exclude regret, equated with a lack of fulfillment in previous findings (Ryff, 1989).\nConvergence of lay perspectives and conceptual and operational definitions\nThe conceptual model covers most of the categories that emerged from participants\u2019 statements regarding the substantive conceptual components. The core elements included evaluative (e.g., a life lived according to one\u2019s values) and affective (e.g., being in harmony) content, as suggested by the conceptual and operational definitions. More statements were subsumed under cognitive appraisals than affective experience, indicating the different facets of evaluative fulfillment. These results demonstrate the complexity of the construct and that conceptualization and operationalization must represent the cognitive experience as multidimensional. The categories of cognitive appraisals can be\u00a0 summarized in terms of contentment with one\u2019s own development (categories: gained better self-knowledge, developed self, meaningful use of talents and resources), with one\u2019s lived life (categories: lived according to own values, suited life, fully lived life, attained personal meaningful goals, recognized meaning and purpose), and with one\u2019s contribution to the welfare of others or a worthy cause (category: contribution/legacy). These aspects can be\u00a0found in the postulated three sources (self, life, impact/legacy) of the FiL model. The proposed criteria for a fulfilled life (wholeness, congruence, meaningfulness) are reflected within different categories. For example, the criterion of wholeness and completeness is found in the category of a fully lived life, congruence is part of the category a suited life, and meaningfulness was featured in the categories recognizing meaning and meaningful use of talents and resources. It should be\u00a0noted that the category of having mastered life is not explicitly represented in our model. However, this notion can be\u00a0 covered by the conceptualization that a fulfilled life consists of having become a whole and complete person and being able to look back on a life well lived and to recognize meaning in difficult periods of life. Nevertheless, these results show that the elements of a fulfilled life derived from lay perspectives essentially correspond with the proposed theoretical model and are substantially represented by the subscales of the FLS. Hence, future research can build on the proposed model and employ the FLS, as it allows the construct to be\u00a0measured directly rather than via a proxy, as has been done in the past.\nGiven the number and variety of mentioned aspects, we\u00a0can conclude that a model and a measure are best built at an abstract level, as we\u00a0 have suggested, because otherwise it would not be\u00a0possible to cover all the facets of what individuals means by a fulfilled life. For instance, the subcategory socially successful is not explicitly part of the model. The goal of our model was to leave the standard of evaluation up to the respondents themselves. Whether, and to what extent, successful relationships play a role in evaluating their achievement of significant goals is left up to them. In this regard, the item on whether one could pursue personally meaningful goals to assess a fulfilled life permits persons to apply it to their preferences and life realities. Therefore, a person who has not been able or willing to start a family may still answer this\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\nitem because it allows them to think in a broader context of personally meaningful goals. If a life goal has become unattainable (e.g., starting a family), the ability to adjust goals and pursue a new meaningful goal is associated with subjective well-being and a sense of purpose (Wrosch et\u00a0al., 2013)."

One main source is meaningful relationships and community in which people share and go through life together. The importance of this source has also been demonstrated by the finding that family and social relationships are predominant categories within contextual definitions of happiness and meaningfulness (Delle Fave et\u00a0al., 2011) or that fulfilling personal relationships are an essential component of lay concepts of a good life (Twenge and King, 2005). Fulfillment derived from other social roles were partnership and parenting. A profession is another vital source of fulfillment, especially if the occupation is enjoyable, allows one to use one\u2019s skills to contribute to others, and matches one\u2019s calling. The theory suggests that viewing one\u2019s occupation as a calling provides people with fulfillment (Wrzesniewski et\u00a0al., 1997; Hall and Chandler, 2005). This assumption was recently confirmed by the finding that the perception of a calling was moderately to highly correlated with a fulfilled life (Baumann and Ruch, 2022). Other fulfilling areas included self-development, savoring, recreational activities, civic engagement, and spirituality. Overall, fulfillment stems from rewarding relationships, meaningful roles, and personally significant activities that allow for self-development and selfexpression, but also from contributing to a cause beyond oneself."

            "heading": "Quantitative findings",
            "text": "Consistent with our qualitative findings, the quantitative results underscore the fact that multiple sources provide fulfillment. An interesting outcome is that participants rated nature as the most fulfilling category. There are several possible explanations for this result. Since people today are less likely to belong to a religious institution, the experience of connectedness to a larger whole could be\u00a0found in nature. Indeed, connectedness with nature has been identified as a source of meaning and assigned to the subdimension of horizontal self-transcendence through a factor-analytic approach (Schnell, 2009). In addition, nature could be\u00a0a place where people feel hopeful (Krafft and Walker, 2018) and experience a sense of beauty and excellence. The latter is a character strength attributed to the virtue of transcendence (Peterson and Seligman, 2004) and its application has been rated as fulfilling (Giuliani et\u00a0al., 2020). Finally, a metaanalysis documented the positive relationship between nature connectedness and various indicators of happiness, such as positive affect, vitality, and life satisfaction (Capaldi et\u00a0al., 2014). Our findings revealed that social and generative roles, including\nparenting, grandparenting, and volunteering, were also found to be\u00a0 very fulfilling. Volunteering and parenting were indeed positively correlated with a fulfilled life measured with the FLS (Baumann and Ruch, 2022). Underlying the three sources discussed is a perspective that transcends the self, implying that fulfillment comes from investing in the well-being of others. Learning and personal development were among the top five categories, suggesting the importance of expanding the self for experiencing fulfillment. Spirituality and religion was another category related to transcendence, but it was rated as less fulfilling than the other categories. However, for people who live their spirituality and religion in everyday life, this category had great relevance for their fulfillment, which was also confirmed in a study using the FLS (Baumann and Ruch, 2022).\nThe level of fulfillment provided by sources varied across age groups. In general, the two older age groups rated various sources as more fulfilling than the youngest age group. For instance, older adults valued the sources of nature and spirituality more highly. This is consistent with previous findings revealing that older individuals more often mentioned spirituality as a domain of happiness (Delle Fave et\u00a0 al., 2016) or that the sense of meaningfulness derived from vertical self-transcendence (religion, spirituality) increased with age (Schnell, 2009). Persons in the second half of life also rated learning and personal development as more fulfilling than their younger counterparts. Contrary to age stereotypes that are still prevalent, people enjoy learning even at advanced ages, as shown by recent meta-analyses that investigated age differences in character strengths (Heintz and Ruch, 2022). Having a life task and a profession were other sources that older participants valued more than younger participants. Even the oldest age group rated a profession as more fulfilling than the middle-aged persons. Although the need to matter and to have a meaningful engagement applies to individuals of different ages, it may be\u00a0particularly essential for the well-being of older adults (Flett and Heisel, 2021). Overall, these findings suggest that as people age, they gain more self-knowledge about what is appropriate and meaningful to them, and thus learn to draw fulfillment from a variety of sources. It is also plausible that older adults are better able to pursue intrinsically motivated goals and have their psychological needs met (Bauer and McAdams, 2004; Mackenzie et\u00a0al., 2018). Women considered friendships and social relationships as more fulfilling than did men. Research has demonstrated that women have more close relationships than men and are also personally more involved (Antonucci et\u00a0al., 2004). In particular, assessing the sources of profession, life task, challenges, partnership and reaching a life goal as highly fulfilling went along with higher levels of a fulfilling life in the present and a fulfilled life in retrospect."

Although the ratings for nature and grandparenthood yielded high means in terms of the fulfillment they provide, they were rarely mentioned in the responses to the\nFrontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin.org\nopen-ended question. The reason for this could be\u00a0 that these aspects were not at the forefront when describing a fulfilled life. This underscores the added value of a mixed methods approach to gain a more complete understanding of fulfillment sources. The emergence of the category of savoring, on the other hand, was rather unexpected and the only one that was not among the listed sources of participants\u2019 ratings. Savoring, which refers to the ability to note and appreciate positive experiences, can relate to the past, present, or future (Bryant et\u00a0 al., 2013) and is related to various positive psychosocial outcomes (Smith et\u00a0al., 2014). In our study, all participants\u2019 descriptions related to savoring in the present. Savoring might enable individuals to enhance the quality of their positive experiences (Bryant et\u00a0al., 2013) and live their lives more consciously. Overall, insights on the nature of sources from both methodological approaches demonstrate the importance of a long-term perspective and having the willingness to commit and to invest over time (e.g., parenthood, achieving a life goal, career). Individuals draw fulfillment from sources that enable them to develop and flourish, but also from providing value to others\u2019 lives."

            "text": "Various participants\u2019 statements referred to prerequisites for a fulfilled life. On the one hand, requirements included psychological resources such as a healthy relationship with oneself, coping skills, and confidence. On the other hand, they comprised social resources, including a good start in life, a sense of being socially integrated, and having supportive relationships. A sense of belonging, for instance, helps people believe that their lives are meaningful (Lambert et\u00a0 al., 2013). Meaningful relationships support individuals in coping with adversity, as well as in their pursuit of opportunities for development and growth, which can have long-term effects on their flourishing (Feeney and Collins, 2015).\nAccording to the participants, positive attitudes and personal qualities are essential for a life well lived. The personal qualities mentioned included positive character traits, personal agency, acceptance, and a positive attitude. These qualities can influence the extent to which one values life and what one makes of it. Participants mentioned curiosity above all, but also bravery and humility. These traits are also referred to as character strengths, which are positively valued personality traits that are thought to contribute to individual and collective fulfillment (Peterson and Seligman, 2004). In addition, it was suggested that strengths provide a basis for healthy processes and the attainment of fulfillment in both good and difficult times (Lopez and Snyder, 2003). Character strengths are known to be\u00a0associated with life satisfaction (e.g., Baumann et\u00a0al., 2020), and the excellent use of signature strengths has been found to be\u00a0fulfilling (Giuliani et\u00a0al., 2020). Moreover, character strengths can be\u00a0cultivated to improve one\u2019s well-being (e.g., Schutte and Malouff, 2019). Whether they also contribute to a fulfilled life in the long term needs to be\u00a0 determined through future research. Taking personal responsibility for creating a fulfilling life, accepting things one\ncannot change, and having a positive attitude were other personal characteristics mentioned.\nA fulfilled life also seems to depend on resources and favorable conditions, some of which are beyond the individual\u2019s control. In this context, participants referred to quality-of-life attributes, including health, financial well-being, individual freedom and opportunities, and a life in balance. There is ample evidence of the importance of factors such as opportunities to choose and income to people\u2019s welfare and flourishing (e.g., Veenhoven, 2015) and, more recently, the relationship between a fulfilled life and contextual factors such as education, financial status, or self-rated health has been demonstrated (Baumann and Ruch, 2022). For example, lack of resources or health issues present barriers to living a calling (Duffy et\u00a0 al., 2017) and thus may hinder experiencing fulfillment in this life area. Therefore, a person\u2019s particular circumstances may influence the extent to which they are able to realize their potential. It is also worth mentioning the aspect of luck, which was only addressed by men. The country in which one is born or whether one is spared from misfortune is due to luck and could frame the degree to which a fulfilling life is possible. Finally, it should be\u00a0 noted that a fulfilling life as an outcome variable can also be\u00a0a resource, as it can promote positive attitudes or improve subjective health."

These three topics relate to the FiL model\u2019s criterion of wholeness/completeness and reflects that at a younger age, many dreams, goals, and life projects that fulfill a life are yet to be\u00a0realized. With increasing life experience, individuals seem more aware that a person\u2019s character, attitude, and initiative facilitate attaining a fulfilled life, as older people compared to younger more often referred to positive traits.\nIn their descriptions, participants referred to several aspects related to Erikson\u2019s suggested developmental tasks that appear to facilitate a fulfilled life. Erikson (1985) proposed that healthy psychosocial development results from the successful resolution of eight specific psychosocial challenges across the lifespan, from each of which a psychological strength is gained. For instance, participants considered the personal development that has taken place throughout life and that has made them the person they are as fulfilling. They also mentioned a good childhood and confidence in life, which can be\u00a0related to the developmental task of building trust, and which leads to the virtue of hope. Creating a stable sense of identity can provide the foundation for a fulfilled life. Erikson (1985) suggested that a clear sense of identity as a young adult serves as a basis for personal development at different stages of life, and the way individuals construct their identity influences adjustment outcomes (Beaumont, 2009). Berzonsky (1989) identified three identity styles: informational (e.g., seeking and evaluating selfrelevant information), normative (e.g., conforming to expectations of close others), and diffuse-avoidant (e.g.,\nFrontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org\ncircumventing identity conflicts and problems.) Failure to develop an integrated sense of one\u2019s identity may hinder the active shaping of one\u2019s life and the pursuit of goals consistent with oneself, which appear essential for a fulfilled life. The results of a path analysis indicate that only the informational identity style predicted self-actualization and self-transcendence in young adults, which in turn predicted meaning in life and subjective happiness (Beaumont, 2009). The informational style also appears to be\u00a0associated with an orientation that exceeds self-interest; it is positively associated with the values of universalism and benevolence (Berzonsky et\u00a0al., 2011). Finding a partner and maintaining a fulfilling partnership can be\u00a0seen as parallels to the challenge of building lasting intimate bonds. The aspect of contributing to the lives of others or to a worthy cause is found in the task of becoming a generative person. Therefore, becoming a mature and adjusted personality involves the ability to be\u00a0other-oriented and caring, which laypersons deemed an essential element of fulfillment (Ryff, 1989). Erikson (1985) considered these preceding stages as precursors to achieving ego integrity:\nOnly in him who in some way has taken care of things and people and has adapted himself to the triumphs and disappointments adherent to being, the originator of others or the generator of products and ideas\u2014only in him may gradually ripen the fruit of these seven stages. (p.\u00a0268).\nThere is empirical evidence that successfully mastering earlier psychosocial challenges predicted ego integrity in older adults, with generativity proving to be\u00a0the strongest predictor (Hannah et\u00a0al., 1996). Psychosocial growth actually facilitated attaining a fulfilled life, as generativity and ego integrity were strongly associated with all dimensions of a fulfilled life (Baumann and Ruch, 2022). In addition, a small positive correlation was found between a fulfilled life and age, suggesting that older adults may look back on a journey in which they have grown, contributed to society, and accomplished personally meaningful projects.\nStrengths, limitations, and future directions To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine lay perspectives of a fulfilled life among adult participants across the lifespan. The fact that our sample included respondents from all life stages and had a gender balance can be\u00a0considered a strength. However, the use of a convenience sample limits the generalizability of the findings. Since our sample consisted of German-speaking participants belonging to an individualistic culture, future research will have to establish whether conceptions of a fulfilled life differ across cultures, especially in comparison to collectivistic cultures. The numerous and valuable perspectives gained using both qualitative and quantitative data contribute to a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of a fulfilled life. By allowing participants to freely describe their conception of a fulfilled life, we\u00a0obtained a rich, diverse, and in-depth collection of information, including conceptual\ncomponents, correlates, and antecedents. Although we\u00a0were able to gain a variety of perspectives and create a comprehensive framework of a fulfilled life, we\u00a0 cannot claim to have been exhaustive. Participants responded very carefully, personally, and with great depth. However, it is not possible to achieve the same depth with open-ended questions as with interviews, for example, which allow for further verification. Our crosssectional design allows us to make statements about age-group differences, but not causality statements about age changes. Thus, age effects could be\u00a0attributed to cohort membership, as typical mentalities of a particular cohort may shape the notions of a fulfilled life. It should be\u00a0noted that significant age and sex differences are based on exploratory analyses without adjustments for multiple testing. Confirmatory studies will need to confirm these results. Finally, it should be\u00a0noted that the first author, who also led the coding, was also involved in the development of the theoretical model of FiL (Baumann and Ruch, 2021). Although the principal investigator coded the data from the bottom up and high inter-rater reliability was achieved, it cannot be\u00a0completely ruled out that prior knowledge may have influenced interpretation to some degree. A natural progression of this work would be\u00a0 to explore whether the lay-suggested antecedents (e.g., social resources, positive traits, or aspects regarding quality of life) are predictors of a fulfilled life."

            "text": "Our overarching framework encompasses many routes by which a fulfilled life can be\u00a0 attained, whether by directly strengthening areas that are considered core elements or by fostering social and psychological resources, personal strengths, or positive attitudes. At the individual level, persons can reflect on and define what an ideally fulfilled life looks like for them and derive appropriate steps. As indicated in our conceptual model, it is essential to consider the core criteria. What is fulfilling depends on whether it contributes to perceiving wholeness, congruence, and significance. In addition, they can evaluate the sources that emerge from this study for their importance and cultivate those that provide the greatest fulfillment. In particular, evaluating the sources of profession and life task as fulfilling seems to have a longer-term impact on a fulfilling life in the present and a fulfilled life in retrospect. At any stage of life, it is worthwhile to pursue a career or activity that is a good fit or even perceived as a calling (Duffy et\u00a0 al., 2017; Baumann and Ruch, 2022). Leading a generative life seems to be\u00a0 a vital avenue to building a life of fulfillment and counteracts stagnation and the experience of emptiness (Erikson, 1982). Our findings also provide an important foundation for counseling on life and career planning. Knowledge of the elements, sources, or conditions of a fulfilled life can help counselors assist their clients in pursuing strategies that lead to a more fulfilling life. At the group and community level, efforts should be\u00a0directed toward building strong marriages and healthy families, giving children a good start in life, and promoting positive education and organizations that create conditions for leading a fulfilling life.\nFrontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "This study contributed to conceptual clarity by revealing what laypersons understand by a fulfilled life. Our qualitative results underscore that the construct is multidimensional and comprises cognitive and affective experiences. Statements that are considered cognitive appraisals indicate what matters to people in evaluating their lived lives. They understood a fulfilled life primarily as having lived life fully, achieved personally meaningful goals, developed themselves, and contributed to others and left a positive legacy. These findings confirm that a fulfilled life consists of many facets and, importantly, involves the notion that a life well lived contains a self-transcendent component. Lay perspectives regarding the core elements are largely consistent with the proposed theoretical conceptualization and the dimension of the FLS. Laypersons recognized that a fulfilled life also depends on personal resources, personal characteristics and quality-of-life aspects. The sources of fulfillment mentioned by participants and those given in the qualitative section largely overlap. It appears that fulfillment requires a long-term view, and that the quality and personal significance of the source are critical. As people age, they seem to succeed in drawing more fulfillment from the various sources. The understanding of what constitutes a fulfilled life is quite similar among younger and older adults and among men and women. The findings help lay the foundation for this emerging line of research and suggest many routes to create a more fulfilling life."
