    "abstractText": "Influenza virus infections continue to be a significant and recurrent public health problem. Although vaccine efficacy varies, regular immunisation is the most effective method for suppressing the influenza virus. Antiviral drugs are available for influenza, although two of the four FDAapproved antiviral treatments have resulted in significant drug resistance. Therefore, new treatments are being sought to reduce the burden of flu-related illness. The time-consuming development of treatments for new and re-emerging diseases such as influenza and the high failure rate are increasing concerns. In this context, we used an in silico-based drug repurposing method to repurpose FDAapproved drugs as potential therapies against the H7N9 virus. To find potential inhibitors, a total of 2568 drugs were screened. Promacta, tucatinib, and lurasidone were identified as promising hits in the DrugBank database. According to the calculations of MM-GBSA, tucatinib (\u221254.11 kcal/mol) and Promacta (\u221256.20 kcal/mol) occupied the active site of neuraminidase with a higher binding affinity than the standard drug peramivir (\u221249.09 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies showed that the C-\u03b1 atom backbones of the complexes of tucatinib and Promacta neuraminidase were stable throughout the simulation period. According to ADME analysis, the hit compounds have a high gastrointestinal absorption (GI) and do not exhibit properties that allow them to cross the blood\u2013 brain barrier (BBB). According to the in silico toxicity prediction, Promacta is not cardiotoxic, while lurasidone and tucatinib show only weak inhibition. Therefore, we propose to test these compounds experimentally against the influenza H7N9 virus. The investigation and validation of these potential H7N9 inhibitors would be beneficial in order to bring these compounds into clinical settings.",

            "text": "In March 2013, an avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection was discovered in humans in East China. Since then, it has infected 1565 people and killed approximately 39% of those who have been confirmed to have the Asian H7N9 virus infection [1,2]. Some influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected humans developed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, with high case fatality rates [3,4]. The influenza A virus (IAV) has two major surface glycoproteins that dominate the virus surface: neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA). The cleavage of \u03b1-(2-3 or 2-6)-ketosidic linkage between terminal sialic acid and adjacent surface glycoprotein is catalysed by NA. Furthermore, this promotes the budding of newly formed viral particles from the infected cell, allowing progeny viruses to infect uninfected host cells and infect respiratory tract mucins [5,6]. HA is responsible for the attachment of the influenza virus to the infected host cell\u2019s surface glycoprotein\u2019s sialic acid. Avian virus HA proteins specifically recognize an \u03b1-2,3linkage found on the epithelial cells of duck intestines. On the other hand, human virus HA proteins prefer sialic acid linked to galactose via an \u03b1-2,6-linkage expressed on the\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4515. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27144515 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4515 2 of 16\nsurface of human respiratory epithelial cells [7\u20139]. The influenza A (H7N9) virus has a higher affinity for the human \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid host cell receptor and a lower affinity for the avian \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acid host cell receptor [10]. Serological studies have found no pre-existing immunity to H7 subtype influenza viruses present in humans [8,11]. As a result, the influenza A (H7N9) virus should be closely monitored due to its potential to cause a pandemic. Research on the development of more potent anti-influenza drugs should be prioritized. NA and adamantanes drugs are the two traditional classes approved for the treatment of IAV infection [6,12]. NA inhibitors are the only way to treat influenza infection in most countries due to the mutation and subsequent resistance to adamantane drugs (amantadine and rimantadine) [13]. There are three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NA inhibitors for treating influenza infection: zanamivir, oseltamivir, and peramivir. At present, laninamivir is only licensed in Japan [2,14,15]. The FDA recently approved a polymerase inhibitor baloxavir marboxil in Japan and the United States as a possible antiviral option against IAV and IBV infection [16,17]. The NA from IAVs is divided into two phylogenetic groups: group 1 (N1, N4, N5, and N8) and group 2 (N1, N4, N5, and N8) (N2, N3, N6, N7, and N9). NA is a homotetramer with an active site in each subunit [6,18]. In IAV and IBV, the active site forms a pocket composed of 19 highly conserved amino acid residues. The inner cavity contains eight highly conserved enzymatic residues (N2 numbering) that interact directly with the sialic acids responsible for enzymatic activity (Arg118, Asp151, Arg152, Arg224, Glu276, Arg292, Arg371, and Tyr406) (Figure 1). Furthermore, the rim contains 11 highly conserved framework residues that stabilize the enzymatic binding pocket (Glu119, Arg156, Trp178, Ser179, Asp (or Asn in N7 and N9) 198, Ile222, Glu227, His274, Glu277, Asp294, and Glu425) [5,19].\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 18\nHA is responsible for the tachment of the influenza virus to the infected host cell\u2019s surface glycoprotein\u2019s sialic acid.

As such, preventive and therapeutic agents, and antiviral drugs are critical to the control of seasonal influenza epidemics as well as the ongoing fight against a pandemic outbreak.

Consequently, it is critical that more novel medical therapies be identified as soon as possible for both preventive and therapeutic purposes. Developing novel therapeutic drugs, on the other hand, is a lengthy, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process that is plagued by more failures than successes [20]. In silico modelling is a useful approach for reducing the cost and time required for drug development [21]. The in silico technique has received a lot of attention as a tool for finding new drug leads, understanding disease mechanisms, and researching drug\u2013target interactions [22,23]. As a result, it has been recognized as a valuable tool in balanced planning and the discovery of potential novel drugs [24]. Virtual screening has improved drug discovery and is now one of the most promising in silico approaches for drug design and development [24].\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4515 3 of 16\nExisting, licensed drugs could be repurposed to produce more therapeutic drugs faster. When compared to the process of generating a drug from scratch, drug repurposing has the potential to significantly reduce development time and cost. This is due to the availability of toxicity and safety data from previous clinical trial phases. In the current study, we used molecular docking studies to perform in silico-based repurposing of FDAapproved drugs against influenza A (H7N9). Peramivir was utilized as a control drug in the comparative investigations. The stability of hit compounds complexed with viral NA was investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In addition, in silico approaches were employed to predict the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of the hit compounds."

Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF)\nRMSF was used to measure the flexibility of the protein residues in terms of the C-\u03b1 atom fluctuations throughout the MD simulation. As shown in Figure 5, the RMSF for individual amino acids correlates with the trend observed in the RMSD of complexes. The average RMSF was found to be 0.90 \u00c5 in the apo-enzyme, 0.78 \u00c5 in the lurasidone, 0.69 \u00c5 in the tucatinib, 0.67 \u00c5 in the Promacta, and 0.67 \u00c5 in the reference peramivir\u2013NA complex. According to our findings, the presence of a ligand at the binding site reduces amino acid flexibility. In all systems, the pattern of residual flexibility is almost identical. Lower fluctuations were observed in the active site residues ranging from residues 110\u2013120, 150\u2013151, 152\u2013160, 230\u2013230, and 270\u2013280, corresponding to the S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 binding subsites, respectively.

Radius of Gyration (RoG) The RoG communicates information about the complex\u2019s stable and unstable folding behaviour during the interaction of a protein and a ligand. A high RoG value indicates low structural compactness, whereas a low RoG value indicates high structural compactness [27]. RoG was therefore used to determine our system\u2019s compactness during the simulation. Figure 6 demonstrates that the apo-enzyme had a higher average RoG value of 20.1 \u00c5 across the 250 ns simulation period than the complexes. Peramivir, lurasidone, tucatinib, and Promacta complexes exhibited average RoG values of 19.7 \u00c5, 19.9 \u00c5, 19.8 \u00c5, and 19.8 \u00c5, respectively. Contrary to lurasidone, the presence of peramivir, tucatinib, and Promacta at the NA active site appears to exert conformational stability and compactness. The NA\u2013lurasidone complex\u2019s higher fluctuations between 100 and 190 ns are assumed to be due to the binding and unbinding of lurasidone in the active site, thus affecting the overall compactness of the complex.\nFigure 5.

Hydrogen Bond Analysis Hydrogen bonding between residues is an important metric for determining a pro-\ntein\u2019s stability. A protein structure\u2019s stability may be increased by the presence of more intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Interactions at the binding site, such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and ionic interactions, largely determine ligand binding affinity [28]. An average of 212 hydrogen bonds was consistently formed in the NA\u2013lurasidone complex (Figure 7). In the cases of the tucatinib\u2013 and Promacta\u2013NA complexes, an average of 214 and 217 hydrogen bonds were consistently formed throughout the simulation period, respectively. Throughout the simulation, an average of 225 hydrogen bonds were formed with the reference ligand, peramivir. In comparison to lurasidone and tucatinib, our analysis revealed that Promacta formed more hydrogen bonds with other amino acids over the simulation time. This could be attributed to the NA\u2013Promacta complex\u2019s conformational stability, which could indicate a stronger binding affinity.\nThe phenomenon of hydrogen bonding was studied to determine which residues at the bonding site contribute to hydrogen bonding. For this purpose, the percentage occupancy of the hydrogen bonds was investigated. Throughout the 250 ns simulation time, the percentage of hydrogen bond occupancy (%) between the ligands and the active site residues was monitored (Figure 8). Based on our results, amino acid residues Arg118, Asp151, Arg152, Glu227, Glu277, Arg292, Asp344, Arg371, and Try406 were identified as the primary residues for hydrogen bonding between NA and the hit compounds, with the highest percentage occupancy, suggesting a significant contribution to system stabilisation. The interaction of the ligands with these primary residues has a significant impact on the efficacy of the ligand. As shown in Figure 6, the complexes of peramivir\u2013, Promacta\u2013, lurasidone\u2013, and tucatinib\u2013NA formed hydrogen bonds with Arg118 at 78%, 40%, 30%, and 32% occupancy throughout the simulation runs. Furthermore, Arg118 and Asp151 were found in nearly all complexes.\n2.3.4. Hydrogen Bond Analysis\nHydrogen bonding between residues is an important metric for determining a protein\u2019s stability.

In the cases of the tucatinib\u2013 and Promacta\u2013NA complexes, an average of 214 and 217 hydrogen bonds were consistently formed throughout the simulation period, respectively. Throughout the simulation, an average of 225 hydrogen bonds wer formed with the reference ligand, peramivir. In comparison to lurasidone and tucati ib, our analysis revealed that Promacta formed more hydrogen bonds with other amino acids over the simulation time. This could be attributed to the NA\u2013Promacta complex\u2019s conformational stability, which could indicate a stronger binding affinity. The phenomenon of hydrogen bonding was studied to determine which residues at the bonding site contribute to hydrogen bonding. For this purpose, the percentage occupancy of the hydrogen b ds was investigated. Throughout the 250 ns simulation time, the percentage of hydrogen bond occupancy (%) between the ligands and the active site residues was monitored (Figure 8). Based on our results, amino acid residues Arg118, Asp151, Arg152, Glu227, Glu277, Arg292, Asp344, Arg371, and Try406 were identified as the primary residues for hydrogen bonding between NA and the hit compounds, with the highest percentage occupancy, suggesting a significant contribution to system stabilisation. The interaction of the ligands with these primary residues has a significant impact on the efficacy of the ligand. As shown in Figure 6 the complexes of peramivir\u2013, Promacta\u2013, lurasidone\u2013, and tucatinib\u2013NA formed hydrogen bonds with Arg118 at 78%, 40%, 30%, and 32% occupancy throughout the simulation runs. Furthermore, Arg118 and Asp151 were found in nearly all complexes.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4515 9 of 16 Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 18\nFigure 7.

According to the binding free energy calculations, the compounds Promacta and tucatinib have the highest binding affinity for NA with a \u2206Gbind of \u221254.11 \u00b1 0.11 and \u221256.20 \u00b1 0.19 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to the reference compound peramivir (\u221249.09 \u00b1 0.13 kcal/mol). Compared to peramivir, the higher \u2206Evdw energy plays an essential role in the \u2206Gbind binding energies of tucatinib and Promacta. This is due to the presence of hydrophobic interactions between amino acid residues in the binding site, which contribute to the stabilisation of the conformation of the Promacta\u2013NA complex. According to our findings, tucatinib\u2013 and Promacta\u2013NA can effectively inhibit by binding to the active site and impeding catalytic activity. Therefore, we recommend that tucatinib and Promacta be investigated for their potential use in the treatment of influenza virus infections. Due to limitations associated with approximations in the binding free energy calculations, the binding free energy values represent a trend for NA\u2013ligand complexes."

The thermodynamic stability and protein\u2013ligand solid interactions in the tucatinib\u2013 and Promacta\u2013NA complexes are thought to be due to the overall higher electrostatic contribution and lower flexibility of the backbone C-\u03b1 atoms.

This section evaluates the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of hit compounds using an in silico Swiss-ADME server to understand pharmacokinetic properties. Table 3 shows that, unlike peramivir, all hit compounds have high gastrointestinal absorption (GI). The ability of a drug to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is a prerequisite for a drug to have effects on the central nervous system. However, if the effect of the drug is needed in other tissues, passage through the BBB can have unfavourable consequences [29]. In the case of hit substances, they lack properties that allow them to pass through the BBB and cause adverse effects.\nTable 3.

According to the ProTox-II server, tucatinib and Promacta both belong to class 5, with LD50 ranging from 2000 to 5000 mg/kg, and may be harmful when administered orally. The LD50 value for lurasidone was less than 2000 mg/kg, indicating that oral ingestion could be harmful, putting it in toxicity class 4. Inhibition of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels is a widely accepted predictor of cardiotoxicity. Screening compounds in the early stages of discovery and development for their ability to inhibit the hERG channel has thus become an essential procedure in the pharmaceutical industry. The Pred-hERG server was used to predict the ability of the hit compounds to inhibit hERG, and the results show that Promacta is non-cardiotoxic, while lurasidone and tucatinib only show weak inhibition."

The major amino acid residues with the highest energy contributions were identified, providing a solid basis for future research into novel and effective influenza virus inhibitors.
