1. **Investigate the stare-in-the-crowd effect in different virtual environments.** The current study was conducted in a virtual environment that resembled a classroom or conference room. Future studies could investigate whether the stare-in-the-crowd effect is also present in other virtual environments, such as a virtual city, a virtual forest, or a virtual office. This would help to determine the generalizability of the stare-in-the-crowd effect and its potential applications in different VR applications.


2. **Examine the effect of different gaze behaviors on user engagement and interaction.** The current study focused on the stare-in-the-crowd effect, which is a specific type of gaze behavior. Future studies could investigate the effect of other gaze behaviors on user engagement and interaction, such as mutual gaze, averted gaze, and gaze avoidance. This would help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how gaze can be used to communicate and interact with users in VR.


3. **Explore the relationship between social anxiety and gaze behavior in VR.** The current study found that social anxiety was negatively correlated with dwell time towards agents who were staring at the user. Future studies could explore this relationship in more detail, investigating how social anxiety affects other aspects of gaze behavior, such as fixation count, first fixation time, and second fixation time. This would help to better understand the role of social anxiety in VR interactions and develop strategies to mitigate its negative effects.


4. **Develop gaze-based interaction techniques for VR.** The current study demonstrated that gaze can be used to initiate interaction with agents in VR. Future studies could build on this finding to develop gaze-based interaction techniques that allow users to interact with virtual objects and agents in a more natural and intuitive way. This could include techniques for selecting objects, manipulating objects, and communicating with agents.


5. **Investigate the use of gaze to create more engaging and immersive VR experiences.** The current study focused on the use of gaze to initiate interaction with agents in VR. Future studies could investigate the use of gaze to create more engaging and immersive VR experiences in other ways. For example, gaze could be used to control the camera, to change the perspective of the user, or to trigger different events in the virtual environment. This could lead to the development of new and innovative VR experiences that are more engaging and immersive than traditional VR experiences.
