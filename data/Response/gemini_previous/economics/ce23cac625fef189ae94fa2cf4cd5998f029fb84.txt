1. **Investigate the impact of opportunity co-creation on entrepreneurial performance in different cultural contexts.** The current study was conducted in China, and it is unclear whether the findings would generalize to other countries with different cultural norms and values. Future research could explore how cultural factors moderate the relationship between opportunity co-creation and entrepreneurial performance.


2. **Examine the role of government support in opportunity co-creation.** The Chinese government played a significant role in supporting entrepreneurship among the poor in the Wuling Mountain Region. Future research could investigate the specific mechanisms through which government support facilitates opportunity co-creation and entrepreneurial performance. This could include examining the role of government policies, programs, and services in providing poor entrepreneurs with access to resources, training, and networks.


3. **Explore the relationship between opportunity co-creation and other forms of entrepreneurship.** The current study focused on opportunity co-creation between poor entrepreneurs and the government. Future research could explore how opportunity co-creation occurs in other contexts, such as between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and angel investors, or entrepreneurs and incubators. This could help to identify common patterns and processes that contribute to successful opportunity co-creation.


4. **Investigate the long-term effects of opportunity co-creation on entrepreneurial performance.** The current study examined the short-term effects of opportunity co-creation on entrepreneurial performance. Future research could follow entrepreneurs over time to examine the long-term impact of opportunity co-creation on their businesses. This could help to determine whether the positive effects of opportunity co-creation are sustained over time.


5. **Develop interventions to promote opportunity co-creation among poor entrepreneurs.** The findings of this study suggest that opportunity co-creation can be a powerful tool for promoting entrepreneurship among the poor. Future research could develop and test interventions designed to promote opportunity co-creation between poor entrepreneurs and government agencies or other stakeholders. This could help to increase the number of poor entrepreneurs who are able to start and grow successful businesses.
