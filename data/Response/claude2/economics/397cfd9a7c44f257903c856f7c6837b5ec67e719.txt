 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine other factor premiums in the REIT market beyond size, value, profitability, investment, and momentum. For example, look at quality, volatility, or liquidity factors. 

2. Conduct a similar analysis on REIT markets in other countries besides the US to see if results hold more broadly. Compare findings across countries.

3. Examine the impact of macroeconomic variables beyond credit spread, TED spread, and the S&P 500 on REIT factor premiums. For example, GDP growth, interest rates, inflation, etc.

4. Analyze the performance of combined factor strategies in REITs, such as a size + value strategy. Assess risk and return tradeoffs of multi-factor approaches. 

5. Use more sophisticated econometric models beyond ARDL and ECM to study the relationships between factor premiums, risk, and macroeconomic variables. For example, GARCH, VAR, machine learning techniques.
