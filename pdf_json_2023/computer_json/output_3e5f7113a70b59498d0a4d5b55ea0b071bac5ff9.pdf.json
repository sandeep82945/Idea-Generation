This study aimed to create a machine-learning model that utilizes the standard 12-lead ECG to forecast acute mortality risk in ED patients. Methods: The database included patients who visited the EDs and underwent standard 12-lead ECG between October 2007 and December 2017. A convolutional neural network (CNN) ECG model was developed to classify survival and mortality using 12-lead ECG tracings acquired from 345,593 ED patients. For machine learning model development, the patients were randomly divided into training, validation and testing datasets. The performance of the mortality risk prediction in this model was evaluated for various causes of death. Results: Patients who visited the ED and underwent one or more ECG examinations experienced a high incidence of 30-day mortality [18,734 (5.42%)]. The developed CNN model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting acute mortality (hazard ratio 8.50, 95% confidence interval 8.20\u20138.80) with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.84 for the 30-day mortality risk prediction models. This CNN model also demonstrated good performance in predicting one-year mortality (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% confidence interval 3.30\u20133.39). This model exhibited good predictive performance for 30-day mortality not only for cardiovascular diseases but also across various diseases. Conclusions: The machine learning-based ECG model utilizing CNN screens the risks for 30-day mortality. This model can complement traditional early warning scoring indexes as a useful screening tool for mortality prediction.\nKEYWORDS\nmortality, emergency department, convolutional neural network, machine learning, electrocardiogram\n01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) have a considerable risk of mortality, estimated to be between 3% and 8% for 30-day mortality (1, 2). Identifying high-risk patients early on can help make appropriate medical management decisions. Early warning scores (EWS) based on simple and widely available parameters are valuable tools for predicting acute mortality risk. Various EWS, including the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) (3), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) (4), Rapid Acute Physiology Score (RAPS) (5), Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) (6), and Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage Score (CART) (7), have been developed to assess acute mortality risk. Immediate risk stratification guides medical staff in making appropriate emergent management decisions and arranging admission to the intensive care unit.\nThe 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important medical test in the ED, and most high-risk patients who present to the ED undergo on or more ECG examinations. Physicians diagnose various medical disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases, arrhythmias, and electrolyte disorders via reading the ECG. Alterations of medical conditions can cause ECG changes, some of which are easily recognized, while others are subtle and difficult to interpret visually by physicians. It can be challenging for physicians to assess the mortality risk using a 12-lead ECG examination. However, the use of convolutional neural network (CNN) machine learning allows for the recognition of these subtle ECG changes.\nDetecting a high risk of acute mortality early on with a 12-lead ECG examination can aid in risk stratification for ED patients. In this study, we aimed to develop a CNN machine learning model using the standard 12-lead ECG to predict acute mortality risk in patients who visit the ED."

The demographics, medical history, medications, and laboratory data were acquired from the Chang Gung Research Database. The survival status was acquired from the National Death Registry Database of Taiwan. All the data were de-identified before analyses, and all personal information was encrypted before the data were released to researchers to protect patient confidentiality. Since the NEWS, MEWS, RAPS, REMS, and CART indexes are derived from the Glasgow coma scale (GCS), oxygen saturation, body temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. We excluded subjects missing any of the EWS index data in the database.\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 02\n2.2. ECG collection and artificial intelligence (AI) model development\nStandard 12-lead ECGs with 10-second voltage-time traces were acquired using MAC 5,000 or MAC 5,500 ECG recorder (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. After ECG acquisition, the ECG tracings were processed and stored using the Marquette Universal System for Electrocardiography (MUSE, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). If a patient has two or more ECG records, we used all ECGs during their ED visit. Each standard 12-lead ECG was stored as a 5,000 \u00d7 12 matrix.\nFor signal input, we used the convolutional network framework (CNN) residual network (ResNet 18) (8) but modified it to fit our signal input (Supplementary Figure S1). We used a wider kernel 15 for the first convolution layer compared with the original ResNet framework as used for the image. This architecture uses skip connections, which allow information to directly pass to the next layer to avoid the degradation caused by deeper neural networks. The network consisted of a convolution layer followed by 4 residual blocks, and each residual block contains two convolution layers. The output of the last block was fed into hybrid pooling (9) by combining max- and average-pooling methods to improve the generalization ability while reducing dimensionality. The output of hybrid pooling was later sent to a fully connected layer to perform the final classification. The output of each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization for distribution normalization and fed into a rectified linear activation unit (10). Cross-entropy loss with Adam (11) optimizer was used in the model. Dropout is applied to reduce overfitting by breakup co-adaptation on training data (12).\nThe AI ECG model incorporated ECG and the mortality scoring systems were analyzed based on the abovementioned model (Supplementary Figure S2). The additional scoring system variables were sent to a fully connected layer and combined max- and average-pooling of the ECG model. The output was later sent to a fully connected layer to perform the final classification."

The CNN model showed a good performance in predicting 30-day mortality. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values were 0.81, 0.71, and 0.99, respectively. Patients who predicted that they would die had a 19% risk of mortality within 30 days, whereas patients who predicted that they would survive\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 03\nhad a 1% risk of mortality within 30 days. Figure 2A shows the ROC curve of acute mortality prediction, with the area under the ROC curve of 0.84. Figure 2B demonstrates the Kaplan\u2013Meier curve of 30-day mortality (odds ratios 8.50, 95% CI 8.20\u20138.80). Although the CNN model was originally developed for shortterm mortality, it demonstrated good performance in predicting long-term mortality as well (Figure 2C). The group predicted to be at high mortality risk had a significantly higher one-year mortality rate than the group predicted to be alive in this mortality prediction model (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% CI 3.30\u20133.39).\nThe model has acute mortality prediction ability in all subgroups, including older patients (>60 years old), hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, chronic obstructive lung disease, and those taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers and statins as revealed by the subgroup analyses (Figure 3). The model exhibited good predictive performance for 30-day mortality across a range of diseases, as illustrated in Figure 4. This included cardiovascular, respiratory, kidney, liver, cerebrovascular, and malignancy diseases.\nSince we employed a multimodal machine learning approach, we also analyzed the performances of machine learning using ECG and the EWS index (see Supplementary Table S1). Our findings indicate that multimodal machine learning, incorporating both ECG and EWS indexes, performed better than machine learning using ECG data alone. Furthermore, the performance of machine learning using only the EWS indexes was the poorest.\nepartments between 2006 and 2017 were included in this study.

EWS indexes, including MEWS, NEWS, and qSOFA, are widely used in the ED to stratify risk for early intensive health care. The NEWS index is a commonly used prediction model for early detection of clinical deterioration, which is based on vital signs and consciousness levels, making it a simple and straightforward scoring system (13). Compared to the MEWS and the qSOFA scoring system, NEWS is one of the most accurate tools for predicting mortality within 24 h (14). In previous reports (14\u201317), the area under the ROC curve for predicting short-term (7\u201330 days) mortality in patients who visited ED was 0.61\u20130.81.\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 05\nPredicting acute mortality can aid clinicians in managing patients at the appropriate time. The EWS indexes use readily available clinical data, including vital signs, oxygen saturation, and consciousness levels. However, the ECG data might be altered by cardiovascular disease, electrolytes, autonomic activities, intracranial diseases, and other systemic diseases. Subtle changes associated the systemic diseases can be identified using the ECG CNN model for predicting acute mortality. The ECG model complements EWS indexes and can effectively predict the risk of acute mortality, enabling clinicians to make early decisions in critical medical care. As the 12-lead ECG is one of the most readily available examinations in the emergency department, combining an ECG examination with the scoring systems could aid in risk stratification and reduce waiting times for intensive care."

The ECG machine learning model exhibited superior predictive accuracy for patients with a high risk of mortality within a month (refer to Supplementary Figure S2).

The model\u2019s superior performance in predicting acute mortality during the first month indicates that it is better suited for\nfrontiersin.org\npredicting acute mortality. This better performance during the first month may be attributed to ECG changes that reflect the immediate systemic clinical condition. In addition, the most critical concern for patients who seek emergency medical attention is the prediction of acute mortality, rather than oneyear mortality. Thus, we modified the model to predict acute mortality. However, the acute-mortality model still performs effectively in predicting long-term mortality."

Accurate prediction of CHD events is crucial for guiding decisions on preventive therapy for hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The Pooled Cohort Equation is a commonly used method to estimate 10-year absolute rates of CHD events in a primary prevention population (18). However, most CHD prediction models are based on major risk factors (19\u201322)\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 06\nand provide no information on overall survival, although they do offer valuable risk information for clinicians to decide whether to prescribe preventive therapy. This ECG model exhibited good prediction performance for most major causes of death, suggesting that the ECG signals are influenced by not only cardiovascular diseases but also other systemic diseases. Disease progression may cause changes in the ECG, some of which may be subtle, but recognizable by the CNN ECG model. Therefore, the CNN ECG model may help clinicians evaluate the future risk of acute as well as long-term mortality for various diseases.\nFor clinical ED staff, risk/mortality screening tools, such as early warning indexes, can be helpful in identifying patients at a relatively higher risk. For patients with a lower risk, the staff can continue to observe them until they exhibit high-risk warning signs. Clinical staff can allocate more attention to the high-risk group. Therefore, a clinical screening tool with low PPV is acceptable."

As the model is based on a convolutional neural network, the algorithm cannot provide complete interpretability of mortality. Additionally, the majority of ECGs analyzed in this study were obtained from Asian patients, and hence the generalizability of the model for mortality prediction may be restricted. Patients in the ED who undergo one or more ECG exams typically have more comorbidities and a higher risk of mortality. The ECG-based machine learning model may not be effective for all ED patients. Moreover, the machine learning study is based on a convolutional neural network, and the interpretability of mortality prediction is currently limited."
