    "abstractText": "Internet of Things (IoT) enables day-to-day objects to connect with the Internet and transmit and receive data for meaningful purposes. Recently, IoT has resulted in many revolutions in all sectors. Nonetheless, security risks to IoT networks and devices are persistently disruptive due to the growth of Internet technology. Phishing becomes a common threat to Internet users, where the attacker aims to fraudulently extract confidential data of the system or user by using websites, fictitious emails, etc. Due to the dramatic growth in IoT devices, hackers target IoT gadgets, including smart cars, security cameras, and so on, and perpetrate phishing attacks to gain control over the vulnerable device for malicious purposes. These scams have been increasing and advancing over the last few years. To resolve these problems, this paper presents a binary Hunter\u2013prey optimization with a machine learning-based phishing attack detection (BHPO-MLPAD) method in the IoT environment. The BHPO-MLPAD technique can find phishing attacks through feature selection and classification. In the presented BHPO-MLPAD technique, the BHPO algorithm primarily chooses an optimal subset of features. The cascaded forward neural network (CFNN) model is employed for phishing attack detection. To adjust the parameter values of the CFNN model, the variable step fruit fly optimization (VFFO) algorithm is utilized. The performance assessment of the BHPO-MLPAD method takes place on the benchmark dataset. The results inferred the betterment of the BHPO-MLPAD technique over compared approaches in different evaluation measures.",

Execution of these in network management and control makes the protection and privacy approach gain great importance and challenge in this setting [2]. IoT applications should protect data privacy from fixing security problems like jamming, intrusions, DoS attacks, eavesdropping, spoofing attacks, spam, malware, and DoS attacks [3]. The safety measure of IoT gadgets relies on the type and size of the entity in which it is enforced. The user\u2019s behavior forces the security gateway to cooperate. In simple, the application, location, and nature of IoT gadgets decide the security measure [4]. For example, smart IoT security cameras can capture various\nSensors 2023, 23, 7207. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23167207 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 7207 2 of 17\nvariables for intellectual decision making and analysis in the smart organization [5]. The utmost care is to be taken with web-related gadgets, as more IoT gadgets depend on the web. It is ubiquitous in the workplace that the IoT gadgets deployed in an entity can be utilized for applying privacy and security features [6]. For instance, wearable gadgets that send and collect users\u2019 health data to connected smartphones must avoid data leakage to ensure privacy. Nearly 25 to 30% of workforces link their personal IoT gadgets with the entity network [7]. The IoTs\u2019 expanding nature allures the attackers and the users. The wide-ranging implementation of IoT gadgets by numerous entities, government sectors, trades, etc., is at high risk because of the devastating impact of data breaches and IoT gadget exploitation [8]. Hackers utilize the weakness of IoT gadgets, gain control over IoT gadgets, and then carry out malicious actions on confidential data with botnet attacks leading to the exposure of valuable information that causes financial loss [9]. One common threat that resulted in data breaches is phishing, a method where adversaries attempt to steal a user\u2019s credentials utilizing fraud attempts [10]. Many large companies like Companies House (UK), Facebook, UPS, WhatsApp, and Fargo have experienced phishing attacks in recent years [11]. In addition to these phishing methods that use delicate data regarding their targets, phishing emails may be modified to look like real emails for increasing the response time to attacks [12]. There has been a rise in spear-phishing and email phishing attacks nowadays since these emails were aimed to directly attack victims, with an increased possibility of getting a response. Still, with the advent of ML in different attack scenarios [13], IoT devices select a protective approach and determine the critical parameter in the security protocol for a trade-off between computation, security, and privacy [14]. This is difficult since it is hard for an IoT platform with limited resources to predict the current network and prompt attack status [15]. The study introduces a binary Hunter\u2013prey optimization with a machine learningbased phishing attack detection (BHPO-MLPAD) method in the IoT environment. The BHPO-MLPAD technique can detect phishing attacks through feature selection and classification. In the presented BHPO-MLPAD technique, the BHPO algorithm primarily chooses an optimal subset of features. The cascaded forward neural network (CFNN) model is employed for phishing attack detection. To adjust the parameter values of the CFNN model, the variable step fruit fly optimization (VFFO) algorithm is utilized. The performance assessment of the BHPO-MLPAD method takes place on the benchmark dataset."

            "text": "As IoT environments become increasingly susceptible to phishing threats, a comprehensive literature review is given to explore existing methodologies and advancements in phishing attack detection within this unique and complex ecosystem. Mughaid et al. [16] developed a detection method using an ML algorithm by splitting the data to train the recognition technique and validate the outcomes with the use of the testing dataset, to capture specific features of the emails and other characteristics to be categorized as phishing or non-phishing with three datasets, and we attained the most efficient and accurate outcomes after making a comparison between them. Abdulrahman et al. [17] introduced an effective ML-based method with the potential to find whether the website is phishing or not. Performance validation of the popular classification method was implemented and revealed Random Forest as the better classifier for the phishing data. An ML-based method for recognizing phishing attacks was constructed using RF with a wrapper based on the classifier attributes evaluator and ranker (CAER) feature selection model. Jain and Gupta [18] introduced an ML-based anti-phishing technique (PHISH-SAFE) with URL features. We have considered fourteen features from URLs for detecting a web page as phishing or non-phishing to evaluate the performance of the presented method. The presented technique is trained by around 33,000 phishing and legitimate URLs with NB and SVM classifiers. Huang et al. [19] developed a new phishing website detection method by identifying the URL websites that is proved to be an efficient and robust detection method. Specifically, the new capsule-based NN primarily involves many related branches where\nSensors 2023, 23, 7207 3 of 17\na single convolution layer extracted shallow features from the URL, and the succeeding two capsule layers produce precise feature representation of the URL from shallow features and discriminates the legitimacy of the URL. The author in [20] investigated an agreement on a definitive feature that must be utilized in phishing recognition. Fuzzy Rough Set (FRS) concept selects an efficient feature from three benchmarked datasets. The features selected are given to three commonly utilized classifiers for phishing recognition. Jain and Gupta [21] developed a method to identify phishing attacks in e-banking and commercial websites through the link and visual similarity. Phishers often try to stimulate the visual design of a website, and fake websites have hyperlinks and identify keywords that point towards legitimate webpages for trapping Internet users. Thus, the presented method inspects keywords, hyperlinks, and CSS layout of websites to identify phishing attacks. Azeez et al. [22] introduced an automatic whitelist method for recognizing phishing. The whitelist can be defined by implementing a thorough review between the actual and the visual links. The similarity of the known trusted websites can be evaluated with the content of the whitelist and matching it with the IP address beforehand, making decisions and inspecting the actual and visual links by evaluating the similarity of the known trusted website. In study [23], the authors devised an email phishing detection structure CNNPD, depending on CNN. CNNPD identify incoming emails as benign or phishing. In study [24], a novel MFO-RELM approach was presented for cyber-security threat detection and classification in the IoT platform. The proposed MFO-RELM approach achieves the effective detection of cybersecurity attacks that occur in the IoT platform. Ruiz-Villafranca et al. [25] examined MECInOT which is a structure dependent upon openLEON and able of creating test conditions for the IoT platform. The performance of this structure has been validated by generating an intelligent attack detector dependent upon tree-based algorithms, namely, RF, DT, and other ML approaches. Rookard and Khojandi [26] introduced a reinforcement learning-based network IDS for detecting attacks on IoT systems employing the TON-IoT database. Specially, the authors utilized the usage of DQN for cyber-attack detection. The authors defined that our DQN carries out an optimum for cyber-attack recognition. Mengash et al. [27] developed a novel search and rescue optimizer with ML-enabled cybersecurity method for an online social networks (SRO-MLCOSN) approach. The proposed SRO-MLCOSN approach concentrates on the detection of CB that ensued in social media. The research gap exists in the scarcity of studies that systematically explore and optimize the highly related features specific to IoT data and the lack of comprehensive investigations into fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance for phishing detection in this unique and dynamic setting. Existing research often concentrates on traditional feature sets and generic hyperparameter settings, failing to address the IoT-specific challenges and intricacies that can significantly impact detection accuracy and robustness in real-world IoT scenarios. A more targeted and in-depth exploration of feature selection techniques and hyperparameter optimization tailored to the IoT environment is needed to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of phishing attack detection in IoT systems.

Since the \u201c0\u20131\u201d problem restricts all the dimensions of the parameter to 0 or 1, it was not appropriate to apply the continuous method to resolve the problem; a binary discrete algorithm was used to resolve these problems. A binary HPO technique is developed that could efficiently resolve the \u201d0\u20131\u201d issues making the typical HPO method inappropriate for resolving discreteness [29].\nThe generation model of the initial population is given below: xj = {\n1 if R1 > 0.5 0 otherwise\n(2)\nIn Equation (2), xi shows the location of its dimensions in all the individuals, and R1 means the randomly generated value within [0\u20131]. The location of every individual\u2019s dimensions in the population comprises 0 or 1 once the population is initialized. Whether this location is 0 or 1 is defined by the random value within [0, 1] produced by this location. When the randomly generated value is more extensive than 0.5, this location is 1; or else, this location is 0.The metaheuristics approach has different ways to expand the continuity model into a binary model; however, it is the most effective and easiest way to utilize the transfer function. A transfer function mapped the continuous real value of inputs to values within [0,1]. There are different types of transfer functions; here, we apply the more often used transformation function, that is, Sigmoid function:\nS(x(t + 1)) = 1\n1 + e\u2212x(t+1) (3)\nIn Equation (3), x(t + 1) denotes the prey location or hunter for the following iteration. Even though the individual in the population was normalized through the transformation function, it is still essential to transform the mapped value from zero to one:\nx(t + 1) = { 0 if S(x(t + 1)) \u2265 R2 1 if S(x(t + 1)) < R2\n(4)\nIn Equation (4), R2 denoted the randomly generated constant within [0, 1]. Once the typical HPO approach upgrades the location of prey or hunter, the binary\nsolution is effectively attained by discrete processing [30]. The binary Hunter\u2013prey optimization (BHPO) technique maintains the features of the typical HPO method."

            "text": "Finally, the VFFO algorithm is used to adjust the parameter values of the CFNN model. The FFO algorithm is a recent approach to search for global optimization depending on foraging behaviors of FFs [33]. The optimization method is split into two stages. Firstly, the FF population exploits an olfactory search to discover the optimum solution, and later, other FFs exploit a visual search to determine the optimum individual and fly toward the direction. This can be repetitive until the fittest solution is found.\nThe primary steps of the FFO are given below: Step 1: Randomly initialize the location of the FF population:\nInit X\u2212axis, Init \u03b3\u2212axis (8)\nStep 2: An FF performs a random search for generating a new location:{ Xi = X\u2212axis + Random Value \u03b3i = \u03b3\u2212axis + Random Value\n(9)\nStep 3: Compute the distance between the origin and the individual FF and later attain the taste judgment value Si:\nDisti = sqrt (\nX2i + \u03b3 2 i\n) (10)\nSi = 1\nDisti (11)\nStep 4: The taste judgment values substituted with the judgment function for obtaining fitness) value of the FFs:\nSmell(i) = Function(S) (12)\nStep 5: Retain optimum fitness fruit fly:\n[bestSmell bestIndex] = min(Smell) (13)\nStep 6: Record the fitness value and location of the better individuals. Next, each of the flies fly toward the location using a visual search:\nSmellbest = bestSmell (14){ X\u2212axis = X(bestIndex) \u03b3\u2212axis = \u03b3(bestIndex) (15)\nStep 7: In an iterative operation, repeat steps 2 to 6; the optimum FF is output once the maximal iterative value is obtained. The FFO algorithm has the lesser control parameter, usability, and simple structure, and its running speed was very fast [34]. But the FFO has related problems to other SI techniques. The optimization can be disorderly and blind, and the search range was smaller, which leads to local optimal solutions and lower optimization accuracy that are easier to fall into local optima because of the random search step sizes leveraged in the process of iterative optimization. In the VFFO method, a dynamic search step size was exploited to enhance the optimization method of the FFO in response to this deficiency, using the ordered convergence features of function to optimize the algorithm efficacy and balance the local optimization and global search abilities:\nlv = ei/gen \u2212 w \u2217 i \u2217 e\u2212i/gen (16)\nwhere i characterizes the existing FF individual, gen denotes the existing amount of iterations, and w shows the weight factor of 0 to 1. To explain the search curve, every generation of search steps has taken a minimal value. The population size was 50, and the maximal amount of iterations was 500 once the weight factor was fixed at 0.8. The variable step sizes enhance the range of search step sizes which change in the original model, considerably extending an efficient searching space of the model and enhancing a variety of solutions. Moreover, the\nSensors 2023, 23, 7207 9 of 17\nsearch step size could attain a convergence rate with the rise in iteration, which makes the algorithm\u2019s resolving procedure effective and orderly, efficiently enhancing the optimization performance and resolving the drawbacks of random search step size [35]. The fitness selection was a crucial factor in the VFFO approach. Solution encoding was utilized for assessing the goodness of solution candidate. The accuracy value was the major condition used to devise a fitness function:\nFitness = max (P) (17)\nP = TP\nTP + FP (18)\nwhere FP and TP indicate the false and true positive values."
