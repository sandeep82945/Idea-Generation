However, as high-dose 26 glucocorticoids are also associated with deleterious side effects, novel approaches are 27 urgently needed to improve GR action in myeloma. Here we reveal a functional crosstalk 28 between GR and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) that culminates in improved myeloma 29 cell killing. We show that the GR agonist Dexamethasone (Dex) downregulates MR levels in 30 a GR-dependent way in myeloma cells. Co-treatment of Dex with the MR antagonist 31 Spironolactone (Spi) enhances Dex-induced cell killing in primary, newly diagnosed GC-32 sensitive myeloma cells. In a relapsed GC-resistant setting, Spi alone induces distinct 33 myeloma cell killing. On a mechanistic level, we find that a GR-MR crosstalk likely arises from 34 an endogenous interaction between GR and MR in myeloma cells. Quantitative dimerization 35 assays show that Spi reduces Dex-induced GR-MR heterodimerization and completely 36 abolishes Dex-induced MR-MR homodimerization, while leaving GR-GR homodimerization 37 intact. Unbiased transcriptomics analyses reveal that c-myc and many of its target genes are 38 downregulated most by combined Dex-Spi treatment. Proteomics analyses further identify that 39 several metabolic hallmarks are modulated most by this combination treatment. Finally, we 40 identified a subset of Dex-Spi downregulated genes and proteins that may predict prognosis 41 in the CoMMpass myeloma patient cohort. Our study demonstrates that GR-MR crosstalk is 42 therapeutically relevant in myeloma as it provides novel strategies for glucocorticoid-based 43 dose-reduction. 44 45 46 47 48\nIntroduction 49 More than 10% of all patients with hematological malignancies are diagnosed with multiple 50 myeloma, which is a plasma cell cancer that is localized in the bone marrow1,2. Despite 51 significant advances in myeloma treatment, synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) such as 52 Dexamethasone (Dex) remain an important pillar of the myeloma treatment protocol because 53 of their strong anti-myeloma activities, justifying their continued use in all treatment stages1,3. 54 However, long-term use of high-dose GCs is hampered by the emergence of GC resistance 55 and side effects including osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, muscle wasting and severe mood 56 swings, which negatively impact patient quality-of-life and treatment adherence4. 57 Both the therapeutic and unwanted effects of GCs are exerted through ligand-58 mediated activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR); a transcription factor belonging to the 59 superfamily of ligand-activated nuclear receptors5. Once GCs bind to GR, the receptor 60 undergoes a conformational change that results in a rearrangement of the Hsp90-FKBP51-61 containing multi-protein complex that aids in nuclear translocation of GR6,7. In the nucleus, 62 ligand-activated GR can promote gene activation, which can be accomplished by GR 63 homodimers binding to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) of target gene promoters or 64 enhancers8,9. In contrast, GR monomers can trigger gene repression by interfering with gene 65 expression programs of other DNA-bound transcription factors such as NF-kB and AP-1 via, 66 for instance, a tethering mechanism10. However, the dominant interaction mode between GR 67 oligomers and other transcription factors on DNA remains a topic of debate11\u201315. 68 The intricate interplay of GR oligomers with other nuclear receptor oligomers, also 69 called nuclear receptor crosstalk, results in a unique gene expression profile that allows for a 70 strengthening or weakening of each receptor\u2019s activity16. This crosstalk was already 71 established for GR and estrogen receptor a (ERa) in breast cancer and for GR and androgen 72 receptor (AR) in prostate cancer17. We serendipitously found that besides GR, the structure-73 wise closely related mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) was differentially expressed between 74 myeloma cell lines. The impact of a possible interplay between GR and MR on GC therapy 75 responsiveness has however not been considered in myeloma. 76 MR responds to two physiological ligands, aldosterone and cortisol, in a cell-type 77 dependent manner and is ubiquitously expressed18,19. This receptor regulates the electrolyte 78 balance and water homeostasis in epithelial cells, while in non-epithelial cells inappropriate 79 MR activation triggers pro-inflammatory and profibrotic effects20. MR-mediated effects are 80 counteracted by MR antagonists, such as Spironolactone (Spi), which are used in the clinic 81 for their cardiovascular and renal protective functions and to lower blood pressure21,22. 82 Crosstalk mechanisms between GR and MR were shown in several tissues16,23,24 and result 83 in the formation of GR-MR heterodimers or even higher order oligomers, thereby modulating 84 the transcriptional activity of each receptor23\u201327. Several studies support that MR inhibits GR-85 mediated gene transcription following GR-MR heterodimerization28\u201330. However, a study in 86 neuroblastoma cells shows that GC-induced transcription was enhanced by a tethering of MR 87 to DNA-bound GR23. How the GC response in myeloma may be influenced by the interplay 88 between GR and MR is still elusive. 89 In this study, we present a novel crosstalk mechanism between GR and MR in multiple 90 myeloma cells that may offer a unique therapy-supportive angle for myeloma treatment. We 91 show that GCs downregulate MR levels in a GR-dependent fashion and that inhibiting MR 92 with Spi culminates in an enhanced Dex-induced myeloma cell killing. We further elaborate 93 on this GR-MR crosstalk by showing that Spi reduces Dex-induced GR-MR heterodimerization 94 and completely abolishes Dex-induced MR-MR homodimerization. Finally, we reveal the 95\ntranscriptomic and proteomic signatures of the Dex-Spi combination treatment that underpin 96 the enhanced myeloma cell killing effects and identify a subset of Dex-Spi-regulated targets 97 that predict survival in the CoMMpass patient cohort. 98\n99 Results 100 Dex downregulates MR levels in a GR-dependent way. 101 We first examined whether GCs regulate MR mRNA and protein levels (Fig.1A,B) in five 102 myeloma cell lines (MM1.S, OPM-2, L-363, U-266 and MM1.R)31,32 with different sensitivities 103 to Dex-mediated myeloma cell killing (Fig.1C). A 6h Dex treatment downregulated NR3C2 104 (MR) transcripts in cells showing the highest GC-inducible MM cell killing (MM1.S, OPM-2 and 105 L-363), while in cells with virtually no GC-mediated MM cell killing (U-266 and MM1.R), NR3C2 106 mRNA levels remained unchanged (Fig.1A). MR protein levels were also downregulated in 107 GC-sensitive MM1.S and OPM-2 cells following 24h Dex treatment and only slightly in GC-108 resistant GR-negative MM1.R cells (Fig.1B). Despite that NR3C2 mRNA is present in all 109 myeloma cell lines (Fig.1A), MR protein levels were hardly detectable in both U-266 and L-363 110 cells (Fig.1B). 111 Dex decreased NR3C1 (GR) mRNA levels only in L-363 cells and thus not in the GC-112 inducible MM1.S and OPM-2 cells (Supplementary Fig.S1; MM1.R is NR3C1-negative). GR 113 protein, however, consistently underwent homologous downregulation following 24h Dex 114 treatment (also known as negative feedback of GR) in all GR-containing MM cells (Fig.1B), 115 which agrees with several reports33\u201336. Next to both receptors, we examined the Dex response 116 of shared target genes. TSC22D3 (GILZ)37 and FKBP531 mRNA levels were upregulated by 117 Dex in all MM cells except MM1.R cells, while SGK141 mRNA levels are decreased by Dex in 118 MM1.S, L-363 and U-266 cells (Supplementary Fig.S1). 119 The dynamic behavior of this Dex-induced MR downregulation was illustrated by 120 showing that from 3h onwards, Dex significantly decreased NR3C2 mRNA levels in MM1.S 121 and OPM-2 cells; a fast regulation that was largely recapitulated at the protein level (Fig.1D-122 E). In contrast to NR3C1 mRNA levels, Dex gradually declined GR protein levels over time 123 (Fig.1D-E), as shown before36. 124 To confirm our observations across GCs with different potencies, we compared, 125 ranked from high to low potency, the following ligands: Dex, fluocinolone acetonide (FA), 126 prednisolone (Pred) and hydrocortisone (Hcort). All GCs consistently downregulated MR 127 protein levels in MM1.S cells (Supplementary Fig.S2A). We observed a double MR band (with 128 Dex, FA) and even multiple MR bands (with Pred, HCort) in MM1.S, while in MM1.R only Pred 129 and HCort induced a clear double MR band, suggestive of post-translational modification of 130 MR38. 131 Several lines of evidence support that the Dex-induced MR protein downregulation is 132 largely GR-dependent. First, we used the GR antagonist RU486. A Dex/RU486 combination 133 left MR protein levels intact compared to Dex alone in MM1.S and OPM-2 cells (Fig.1F). In 134 addition, an siRNA-based GR knockdown in MM1.S cells showed that MR levels are at least 135 partially protected from Dex-induced downregulation in siGR compared to siCtrl conditions 136 (Fig.1G), overall supporting a GR-dependent mechanism. Noteworthy, knockdown of GR was 137 already sufficient to increase the basal MR protein levels in MM1.S cells. Thirdly, in GR-138 negative MM1.R cells, Dex may bind MR instead, although this was clearly not sufficient to 139 trigger the pronounced MR downregulation that was observed in GR-positive MM1.S cells. 140 To investigate whether Dex lowered NR3C2 levels post-transcriptionally, we used 141 actinomycin D (ActD) to block de novo transcription in MM1.S cells. ActD by itself reduced 142 NR3C2 levels three-fold compared to solvent condition, indicating that MR mRNA is unstable 143\n(Fig.1I). Addition of Dex on top of ActD could not further reduce the residual NR3C2 mRNA 144 levels, suggesting that novel gene transcription is needed. Next, we evaluated whether 145 mechanisms centered at the protein level were contributing to Dex-induced MR 146 downregulation. The protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), of which the activity 147 was confirmed via \u03b2-catenin downregulation (positive control), combined with Dex did not 148 further reduce the MR protein levels at 6h treatment compared to Dex alone. This indicates 149 that Dex requires novel protein synthesis to decrease MR protein levels (Fig.1J). In addition, 150 Dex did not decline MR protein levels via lysosomal degradation, as assessed with 151 chloroquine (positive control: LC-3) or via proteasomal degradation, as evaluated with the 152 proteasome inhibitor MG132 (positive control: Hsp70) (Supplementary Fig.S2B-E). 153 Taken together, GCs decrease both MR mRNA and protein levels in MM cell lines with 154 different degrees of GC-mediated MM cell killing in a GR-dependent manner, corroborating 155 the existence of GR-MR crosstalk in these cells (Fig.1H). Our findings also demonstrate that 156 MR mRNA is unstable and that Dex requires de novo transcription and translation to decrease 157 MR levels in MM cells. 158 159 MR antagonism enhances GC responsiveness of MM1.S cells. Because Dex can 160 decrease MR mRNA and protein levels in MM cells, we examined whether a targeting of MR 161 could affect the anti-MM activity of GCs. Hereto, we used three different strategies. First, we 162 used MR knockdown using siRNA\u2019s (siMR, Fig.2A-B) and found that the MM1.S cell viability 163 was markedly reduced even in absence of Dex (Fig. 2A). Although the effect size by which 164 Dex reduces the MM1.S cell viability was comparable in siCtrl and siMR conditions, the cell 165 viability was significantly lower (~55%) in the siMR Dex compared to the siCtrl Dex condition 166 (~80%, Fig.2A), Altogether, this suggests that MR presence may protect against myeloma cell 167 death. 168 Second, to evaluate how MR levels evolve upon prolonged GC treatment, we 169 developed a cell model that mimics the gradual build-up of GC resistance. Here, MM1.S cells 170 were treated for four weeks with a low dose of Dex (10-8M) followed by a high dose of Dex 171 (10-6M) for 24h to assess the residual GC responsiveness of the MM cells to cell killing 172 (Fig.2C). When MM cells were treated for four weeks with solvent, the additional 24h high-173 dose Dex resulted in a marked decrease in MR protein levels (Fig.2C, lane 1 vs 2), in line with 174 Fig.1B. In contrast, after four weeks low-dose Dex, MR levels no longer declined following a 175 24h high-dose Dex (Fig.2C, lane 3 vs 4). Apoptotic marker analyses confirmed that the four 176 weeks low-dose Dex, indeed rendered MM1.S cells refractory to the 24h high-dose Dex boost 177 (Fig.2C, lane 2 vs 4). We found decreased cleavage of pro-apoptotic PARP and caspase 3, 178 reduced levels of pro-apoptotic Bim and increased levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL (Fig.2C, lane 179 2 vs 4). 180 Third, because MR knockdown promoted MM1.S cell killing (Fig.2A), we sought to 181 complement these findings by using the MR antagonist Spironolactone (Spi). A concentration-182 response experiment showed that 10-5M Spi (24h) supported a mild cell killing in MM1.S cells 183 (Fig.2D), but not in endothelial EA.hy926 cells (72h, toxicity control, Supplementary Fig.S3A). 184 Next, we treated MM1.S cells for 24h with a combination of Dex (10-6M) and Spi (10-5M) and 185 showed increased cleavage of pro-apoptotic PARP and caspase 3, and a decrease in anti-186 apoptotic Bcl-xL (Fig.2E). Confirmatory Annexin V/PI flow cytometric analyses showed that 187 Dex-Spi combination decreased the percentage of viable MM1.S cells and increased the 188 percentage of early-and late-apoptotic cells compared to each treatment alone (Fig.2F-G, 189 Supplementary Fig.S3B). Spi enhanced Dex-induced MM1.S cell killing already at 24h 190\n(Fig.2H) and at 72h to an even higher extent (Fig.2I). Finally, also Pred- and Hcort-mediated 191 MM1.S cell killing was boosted by Spi (Fig.2J-K). 192 Summarized, our results suggest that MR is a pro-survival factor in myeloma and that 193 its pharmacological inhibition enhances GC-induced MM1.S cell killing. 194 195 The ability of Spi to promote Dex-induced cell killing correlates with the Dex 196 responsiveness of MM cell lines. To determine whether a Dex-Spi combination is effective 197 across MM cell line models, we screened four other MM cell lines in which GCs induce MM 198 cell killing to varying extents (Fig.1C). Whereas the MR antagonist Spi did not readily promote 199 GC-mediated OPM-2 killing at 24h of treatment, this was observed after 72h of treatment 200 (Fig.3A) as strongly as observed for MM1.S cells (Fig.2I). Hence, the threshold to obtain an 201 efficient Dex-Spi-induced killing could have a time-dependent component when comparing 202 OPM-2 to MM1.S. 203 Next, we tested MM cells that are less (or un)responsive to Dex in terms of cell killing 204 to evaluate whether Dex-Spi still offers therapeutic benefit. Although L-363 cells respond 205 slightly to Dex treatment, Spi did not significantly impact Dex-mediated cell killing of these 206 cells after 72h (Fig.3B), which may be due to the very low amounts of MR that these cells 207 contain (only detectable at mRNA level, Fig.1A-B). The same reasoning applies to the 208 Dex-unresponsive U-266 cells, where Spi alone caused only a mild drop in cell viability (~10%, 209 Fig.3C). Interestingly, in MM1.R cells, which are GR-negative yet strongly MR-positive 210 (Fig.1B), Spi alone triggered a marked decrease in cell viability at 72h of treatment (drop of 211 ~30%, Fig.3D), for which GR presence is clearly not required. 212 In summary, in myeloma cells that contain detectable protein levels of both GR and 213 MR, Spi enhances Dex-induced myeloma cell killing (Fig.3E). 214 215 Combining lower doses of GC with MR antagonist enhances cell death of primary MM 216 cells. 217 To validate the potential of a Dex-Spi combination treatment in a preclinical context, we 218 isolated primary MM cells from bone marrow aspirates of 10 MM patients at different disease 219 stages (Table 1). In line with our observations in MM1.S and OPM-2 cells, newly diagnosed 220 MM1 (Fig.4A) and MM2 (Fig.4B) patient cells as well as the premalignant smoldering MM9 221 patient cells (Fig.4K) displayed higher cell killing when combining Dex and Spi versus Dex 222 alone. Importantly, 10-7M Dex combined with 10-5M Spi was at least equally efficacious as 10-223 6M Dex (~40mg comparator dose in patients) alone (full arrow). As could be expected from a 224 heterogeneous disease as myeloma, not all patient samples responded alike. Newly 225 diagnosed MM3 patient cells (Fig.4C) strongly responded to Dex but had no additional benefit 226 from Spi treatment. Furthermore, MM10 cells of a premalignant MGUS patient (Fig.4L) hardly 227 responded to Dex treatment, while Spi alone reduced the cell viability with about 20% (dashed 228 arrow). Notable, in all relapsed patient cells (MM4, MM5, MM6, MM7 and MM8, Fig.4D-H), 229 Spi alone triggered a pronounced cell killing (Fig.4D-H), with a reduced cell viability of max. 230 up to 60% (Fig.4H). All relapsed patient cells were found to be resistant to Dex-induced cell 231 killing, except MM4, which may explain why a Dex-Spi combination did not further improve on 232 cell killing as compared to Spi alone. 233 Only for MM1, MM2, MM3, MM4 and MM5 patients the primary cell yield was 234 sufficiently high to allow for an analysis of GR and MR target gene expression following Dex 235 treatment. We selected TSC22D3 and SGK1 because 1) of their opposing Dex response in 236 our MM cell lines (Supplementary Fig.S1), 2) studies indicate anti-proliferative actions 237 (TSC22D3)37 or pro-survival effects (SGK1)39, and 3) the receptors themselves were below 238\nthe detection limit as assessed by RT-qPCR. Dex treatment upregulated TSC22D3 mRNA 239 levels in 2 out of 3 newly diagnosed patient cells (MM1 and MM3) and in both relapsed patient 240 cells (MM4 and MM5) (Fig.4I), while SGK1 mRNA levels were downregulated in 1 out of 3 241 newly diagnosed patient cells (MM3) and in both relapsed patient cells (MM4 and MM5) 242 (Fig.4J); hereby recapitulating the varying degree in Dex-responsiveness that was also 243 retrieved in the MM cell lines (Supplementary Fig.S1). 244 To examine whether NR3C2 and/or NR3C1 expression levels could predict survival, 245 we took advantage of publicly available RNA-sequencing data generated in the framework of 246 the CoMMpass study of the MM research foundation (MMRF). We found that NR3C2 levels 247 were much lower than those of NR3C1 at diagnosis (Fig.4N). Nonetheless, NR3C2 levels 248 were predictive for overall survival (OS) when patients were divided in 3 groups based on 249 high, medium, and low expression of NR3C2 (Fig.4O). This was not the case when 250 progression free survival (PFS) was assessed (Supplementary Fig.S3A). NR3C1 expression 251 levels were not predictive of either PFS or OS (Fig.4P, Supplementary Fig.4B). 252 Taken together, in newly diagnosed and premalignant myeloma patients, a 10-fold 253 lower Dex dose in combination with Spi could be advantageous, although the extent of the 254 therapeutic benefit will differ among patients (Fig.4M, top panel). In the relapsed setting, Dex 255 is barely functional, but Spi alone does induce distinct MM cell killing (Fig.4M, bottom panel). 256 Finally, NR3C2, but not NR3C1 expression levels are associated with OS in patients. 257 258 GR and MR interact at the endogenous level in MM cells. 259 Because crosstalk mechanisms between nuclear receptors can arise from a direct 260 interaction16, we examined to which extent and in which direction Dex-Spi steers GR-MR 261 heterodimerization compared to Dex, via two complementary methods. First, we developed a 262 NanoBiT-based quantitative GR-MR heterodimerization assay in HEK293T cells that relies on 263 overexpressed tagged receptors and in cellulo reconstitution of a functional NanoLuc 264 luciferase (Fig.5A). In this assay, a signal for GR-MR heterodimerization is only measured 265 when GR coupled to SmBiT and LgBiT coupled to MR interact (Fig.5A). We found that Dex 266 triggered an ~8-fold induction of GR-MR heterodimerization, which was reduced when 267 combined with Spi to ~6-fold (Fig.5B-C). In contrast, Spi alone failed to induce GR-MR 268 heterodimerization. 269 We compared the NanoBiT assay results with endogenous GR-MR co-immunoprecipitation 270 (co-IP) analyses in MM1.S and OPM-2 cells. Already in basal conditions, GR and MR 271 interacted in the IP fraction (lane 2, Fig. 5D,F). In line with the NanoBiT results, Dex treatment 272 consistently increased this interaction in MM1.S and OPM-2 cells. Similarly, Dex-Spi 273 combination again reduced this GR-MR interaction compared to Dex treatment. In contrast to 274 NanoBiT, Spi alone did support a marked GR-MR interaction in an endogenous context, 275 although to a lower extent than Dex alone. 276 To examine whether the Dex-Spi combination could also impact receptor homodimer 277 formation, we extended our NanoBiT assay portfolio towards GR-GR and MR-MR 278 homodimerization. We found that Dex triggered a ~3.5-fold induction in GR-GR homodimer 279 formation, which was unaffected by the addition of Spi (Fig.5F-G). In contrast, Spi completely 280 abolished the Dex-induced MR-MR homodimer formation (Fig.5J-K). 281 Summarized, GR and MR engage in an endogenous interaction in MM cells. 282 Quantitative assays indicate that Spi blunts Dex-induced GR-MR and MR-MR dimerization. 283 284 Dex-Spi combination strongly inhibits several major players in myeloma cell survival. 285 To determine whether GR-MR crosstalk leads to differential transcriptomic signatures, we 286\nfollowed an RNA-sequencing approach. Principal component analysis showed that the 287 biological repeats are well clustered per condition (EtOH, Dex, Spi, Dex-Spi) (Supplementary 288 Fig.S6A). Differential gene expression analysis of pairwise comparisons revealed that the 289 highest number of unique genes were regulated by Dex-Spi (596) (Supplementary Fig.6B). 290 Volcano plots further highlight significant genes with the largest log2 fold changes (log2FC; 291 red and blue) for different pairwise comparisons, including \u2018Dex-Spi vs EtOH\u2019 (Fig.6A), \u2018Dex 292 vs EtOH\u2019 and \u2018Spi vs EtOH\u2019 (Supplementary Fig.S6C-D). Several top genes that were shared 293 between pairwise comparisons and that are typical target genes for GR and MR, i.e. 294 TSC22D3, FKBP5 and SGK1, were analyzed by RT-qPCR to validate the RNA-sequencing 295 results (Supplementary Fig.S6B). In MM1.S, OPM-2 and L-363 cells, TSC22D3 296 (anti-proliferative action)37 and FKBP5 (GR co-chaperone)40 mRNA levels were upregulated 297 to a lesser extent by 6h Dex-Spi treatment than by Dex alone, in line with their corresponding 298 count plots (Supplementary Fig.S6D-H). In addition, SGK1 (stimulates myeloma cell 299 survival)39 mRNA levels were downregulated to a similar extent by Dex-Spi and Dex in MM1.S 300 and L-363 cells, again in line with the RNA-sequencing results. In search of significantly 301 regulated side-effect markers, the bone homeostasis marker TMEM11941,42 was selected 302 given that this gene may act as a molecular proxy for GC-related bone disease. Dex-Spi 303 combination showed a mild, yet consistent upregulation of TMEM119 in MM1.S, OPM-2 and 304 L-363 cells (Supplementary Fig.S6D-H). 305 To prioritize candidate genes for validation at the protein level, we identified the 306 molecular and cellular functions attributable to the \u2018Dex-Spi vs EtOH\u2019 comparison by 307 performing an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). We found groups of genes that were 308 significantly involved in gene transcription (terms: gene expression and RNA post-309 transcriptional modification), cell death and survival and cell cycle (Supplementary Fig.S7A). 310 Based on the top regulated genes from each comparison in these IPA terms (Fig.6A, 311 Supplementary Fig.S6C-D, S7A), we selected genes that were involved in transcriptional 312 regulation (POLR2A, HEXIM1), cell growth, proliferation and/or survival (MYC, CCND1, 313 CCL3) and validated these at the protein level in MM1.S, OPM-2, L-363 and MM1.R cells 314 (Fig.6B, Supplementary Fig.S7B-C). Interestingly, c-myc (oncogene)43 protein levels were 315 significantly decreased by Dex-Spi as compared to Dex alone in both MM1.S and OPM-2 cells 316 (Fig.6B), again in line with our RNA-sequencing results, and also by Spi alone in MM1.R cells 317 (Supplementary Fig.S7C). Whereas RNA polymerase II (Pol II) levels were largely unchanged 318 comparing Dex-Spi versus Dex alone, activated Pol II protein levels, hallmarked by Ser2 319 phosphorylation44, decreased markedly upon Dex-Spi, yet only in MM1.S cells (Fig. 6B); 320 indicating a halt in the transcription elongation process. In OPM-2 cells, a brake on 321 transcription induced by Dex-Spi may rather originate from a mild upregulation (vs Dex) of the 322 transcriptional repressor HEXIM145. Cyclin D1, a protein downregulated by GCs to induce cell 323 cycle arrest46, was downregulated to the same extent by Dex-Spi as by Dex alone in MM1.S 324 cells, while in OPM-2 cells, Dex-Spi triggered the largest decrease in cyclin D1 protein levels. 325 In addition, in MM1.S cells, the protein levels of CCL3, a contributor to myeloma cell migration 326 and an aggravator of bone disease47, were decreased similarly in all conditions versus solvent 327 (Fig.7B). In OPM-2 and L-363 cells, CCL3 was largely undetectable. 328 We also examined the Dex:Spi interaction term (Fig.6C), which contained 37 significantly 329 regulated genes (Supplementary Fig.S1) and of which the response following Dex-Spi 330 treatment is hypothesized to be significantly different from combining the responses of 331 separate Dex and Spi treatments. Three genes were selected for validation at the protein level 332 based on their high normalized counts, previously described function in myeloma, and 333 accompanying primary antibody performance (in WB): 1) DDIT4 (also known as REDD-1), 334\npromotes myeloma cell growth and survival48 and is described as a GC-inducible muscle 335 atrophy marker49; 2) ERN1 (also known as IRE1a), a sensor of unfolded proteins and critical 336 for MM tumor growth50; 3) POU2AF1 (also known as BOB-1), a regulator of oncogenic 337 networks in myeloma51. Interestingly, REDD1 protein levels were decreased by Dex-Spi 338 combination versus Dex in MM1.S cells and, to a similar extent, by Spi and Dex-Spi in OPM-339 2 cells (Fig.6D). In L-363 cells, REDD1 levels were equally increased by Dex and Dex-Spi 340 (Supplementary Fig.S7D). Both BOB-1 and IRE1a were most strongly decreased by Dex-Spi 341 combination in MM1.S cells and comparably decreased by Dex and Dex-Spi treatment in 342 OPM-2 cells (Fig.6D). In L-363 and MM1.R cells, IRE1a levels were not clearly regulated by 343 any treatment (Supplementary Fig.S7D). 344 Taken together, our transcriptome analysis and subsequent validation at the protein 345 level reveals that gene transcription is halted more strongly by Dex-Spi than by Dex alone in 346 MM cells, with c-myc, cyclinD1, REDD1 and BOB-1 being strongly Dex-Spi-downregulated 347 targets. 348 349 c-myc target genes are mostly downregulated by Dex-Spi. 350 We expanded our RNA-seq analysis by zooming in on genes that were uniquely up-or 351 downregulated by the Dex-Spi combination. We found 311 genes to be uniquely upregulated 352 by Dex-Spi, as shown by their normalized gene expression profile (Fig.6E). GSEA shows that 353 genes upregulated by Dex-Spi (green curve) or Dex (red curve) treatment were enriched for 354 a previously established GR activity score52 (Fig.6F). 355 We then focused on the 264 genes that are uniquely downregulated by Dex-Spi 356 treatment and for which their normalized gene expression is depicted in Fig.6G. GSEA-based 357 overrepresentation analysis (Supplementary Fig.S7E) identified that two hallmarks containing 358 different sets of myc target genes were significantly enriched in the set of genes that are 359 uniquely downregulated by Dex-Spi. Zooming in on these \u2018myc hallmarks\u2019 (Fig.6H-I) confirmed 360 that the most negative normalized enrichment scores (NES) was indeed obtained for Dex-Spi. 361 In addition, we examined whether the expression levels of the uniquely Dex-Spi 362 downregulated genes could predict survival, for which we again relied on the CoMMpass 363 cohort data. Strikingly, we found that patients showing low expression of the Dex-Spi 364 downregulated genes had better PFS and OS compared to patients showing high expression 365 of these genes (Fig.6J, Supplementary Fig.S7F). Prognostic factor analysis highlighted that 366 this prediction is better than when random gene signatures were used (Fig.6K, full red line). 367 Overall, the inhibition of c-myc target genes likely underpins the enhanced myeloma 368 cell killing observed with Dex-Spi. 369 370 Shotgun proteomics analyses unveils a contribution of metabolic pathway deregulation 371 upon Dex-Spi treatment. 372 To gain additional mechanistic insights into the Dex-Spi combination treatment at 24h 373 treatment, we performed mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics on MM1.S cells. 374 Differential expression analysis showed that the highest number of hits (i.e. proteins) was 375 again identified for the Dex-Spi combination treatment (Fig.7A); in line with RNA-sequencing 376 results (Supplementary Fig.S6B). Volcano plots further highlighted significant proteins with the 377 largest log(LFQ) difference (red and blue) for different pairwise comparisons, including \u2018Dex-378 Spi vs EtOH\u2019 (Fig.7B), \u2018Dex vs EtOH\u2019 and \u2018Spi vs EtOH\u2019 (Supplementary Fig.S8A,C). 379 Overrepresentation analyses of the Dex-Spi regulated proteins identified that several 380 hallmarks of metabolism, including oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism were 381\nsignificantly upregulated, while the hallmarks for cholesterol homeostasis, G2M checkpoint 382 and E2F targets were significantly downregulated (Fig.7C). Zooming on the individual 383 hallmarks (Fig.7D-G, Supplementary Fig.S8E-H) learned that only proteins regulated by Dex-384 Spi, and not by Dex or Spi, were significantly enriched for oxidative phosphorylation and fatty 385 acid oxidation (Fig.7D-E). Cholesterol homeostasis was rather inhibited by the Dex-Spi 386 regulated proteins (Fig.7F). In contrast, all treatments (Dex-Spi, Dex and Spi) gave rise to a 387 significant enrichment of the G2M checkpoint and E2F targets, but it was rather Dex alone 388 that inhibited these hallmarks the most (Fig.7G, Supplementary Fig.7E). In addition, the Myc 389 V2 hallmark was only significantly enriched upon Spi treatment in the proteomics analyses 390 (Fig.S8G-H), while this enrichment was significant for all treatments in the RNA-sequencing 391 analysis (Fig.6H-I), which may be due to a difference in treatment time in both setups (6h vs 392 24h). Nonetheless, the master regulator c-myc was differentially regulated at the protein level 393 (Fig.6B). 394 Finally, we examined whether the expression levels of Dex-Spi regulated proteins could 395 predict survival in the CoMMpass cohort. The genes corresponding to the proteins that were 396 uniquely up-or downregulated by Dex-Spi (upset plots, Supplementary Fig.8E-F) were used 397 as input as only transcriptomics data are available for the CoMMpass cohort. We found that 398 patients having a low expression of the proteins uniquely downregulated by Dex-Spi had a 399 better PFS and OS than patients having a high expression of these targets (Fig.7H, 400 Supplementary Fig.S9A). In contrast, high expression levels of proteins that were uniquely 401 upregulated by Dex-Spi identified patients with worse PFS and OS (Fig.7I, Supplementary 402 Fig.S9B). 403 Summarized, on a mechanistic level, we additionally resolved that the Dex-Spi 404 combination treatment deregulates several metabolic pathways. 405 406 Discussion 407 In this study, we have identified a novel, functionally relevant nuclear receptor crosstalk 408 mechanism between GR and MR in myeloma cells (summarized in Fig.7J). We have shown 409 that although MR levels were decreased upon Dex treatment over time in a GR-dependent 410 manner (A; Fig.7J), endogenous GR strongly interacts with MR in a Dex-inducible manner at 411 early stages (B; Fig.7J). We further found that Spi clearly diminished Dex-induced GR-MR 412 heterodimerization and completely abolished Dex-induced MR-MR homodimerization (B, 413 Fig.7J). Dex-Spi combination treatment also gave rise to a differential transcriptomic and 414 proteomic signature (C; Fig.7J) that can help explain the enhanced Dex-induced myeloma cell 415 killing in combination with Spi (D; Fig.7J). These four main findings will be discussed in further 416 detail below. 417 We found that Dex downregulates MR levels likely by a superposition of different 418 mechanisms. In earlier work, GCs were reported to reduce the stability of pro-inflammatory 419 mediators, such as TNFa, by upregulating mediators of mRNA decay53. A similar mechanism 420 decreased the NR3C2 mRNA stability in renal epithelial cells subjected to hypertonic 421 conditions54, and recently several NR3C2-targeting miRNA\u2019s were identified in this context55. 422 In myeloma cells, Dex did not further reduce the MR mRNA stability following ActD treatment 423 (Fig.1I). Pharmacological inhibition of transcription and translation rather supported that the 424 Dex-induced decline of MR mRNA and protein depended, at least partially, on both 425 mechanisms. Noteworthy, Dex treatment also induced a second MR band, approximately 426 10kDa upwards, hinting at various post-translational modifications. Although an Aldosterone-427 induced upward shift of MR of even 30kDa was reported before, this was linked to increased 428 phosphorylation on several serine residues with subsequent MR polyubiquitination and 429\nproteasomal degradation56. In the MM cell context however, Dex did not decrease MR protein 430 levels via proteasomal or lysosomal degradation (Supplementary Fig.S2B-E). Although GR 431 was clearly required for the Dex-induced MR downregulation (Fig.1B,F,G), an additional 432 regulatory mechanism whereby GCs may directly bind to and affect MR, as in MM1.R cells 433 that lack GR (Supplementary Fig.S2A), cannot be excluded. 434 We are to the best of our knowledge the first to report that endogenous GR and MR 435 may form heterodimers or are at least part of the same protein complex in myeloma cells. 436 Compared to typical nuclear receptor heterodimers (e.g. RXR and PPAR), atypical 437 heterodimers such as GR-MR could be less prominent and transient, but that does not exclude 438 a potentially strong functional effect16. Although GR and MR connect already in basal 439 conditions, their interaction was further supported by Dex via two orthogonal assay systems 440 (Fig.5B-G). Spi, however, consistently reduced Dex-induced GR-MR heterodimerization 441 (Fig.5B-G) and completely abolished MR-MR dimerization (Fig.5J-K). Together, these results 442 support a hypothesis that altered receptor dimerization equilibria may mechanistically 443 contribute to an altered transcriptome and proteome profile and ultimately to the enhanced 444 cell killing induced by the Dex-Spi combination. Besides direct, also indirect crosstalk 445 mechanisms can affect the therapy response, as shown for GR and AR in prostate cancer, 446 where even diminished responsiveness to enzalutamide (anti-androgen) was observed17,57. 447 Although the GR-MR crosstalk in MM1.S and OPM-2 cells may entail a direct physical 448 interaction (Fig.5B-E,5H-I), further studies are necessary to discriminate between tethering-449 based interactions or cooperative DNA binding modes23,27 in the context of myeloma. 450 Transcriptome analysis has shown that Dex-Spi halted markers of transcription 451 elongation. We found decreased Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation in MM1.S cells (Fig.6B), which 452 agrees with earlier work resolving tethering-based GR repression mechanisms in an 453 inflammatory setting. There, Dex-activated GR hampered Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation at 454 several NF-kB-regulated promoters44. In OPM-2 cells, increased expression of the 455 transcriptional repressor HEXIM1 appeared more decisive for a Dex-Spi-induced block in 456 transcription elongation (Fig.6B). The latter findings agree with a study where HEXIM1 457 sequestered positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to inhibit transcription 458 elongation of tumorigenic genes45. In line, Rogatsky and colleagues demonstrated that GR 459 can even inhibit recruitment of the P-TEFb complex that is normally responsible for Pol II Ser2 460 phosphorylation58. Altogether, Dex-Spi consistently triggers several (consecutive) steps to 461 inhibit transcription in GC-sensitive MM cells, regardless of cell-line specific regulations of the 462 underlying markers. 463 Furthermore, our results strongly suggest that c-myc and many of its target genes 464 (Fig.6B, 5H-I) may be responsible for the enhanced myeloma cell killing induced by Dex-Spi. 465 The fact that GCs decrease c-myc levels is well documented in literature46,59, and results in 466 cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in leukemia cells59; even Spi alone was linked to decreased 467 c-myc activity before60. In myeloma, reports show that c-myc protein was overexpressed in 468 40% of patients at diagnosis, which correlated with shorter OS43. Moreover, in 2022, the team 469 of Rosen showed that inhibiting SUMOylation in myeloma cells resulted in decreased c-myc 470 protein stability, which in turn decreased the levels of several miRNAs involved in either GR 471 downregulation or GC resistance61. Using survival analyses on the CoMMpass patient cohort 472 (Fig.6J-K), we further found that patients have a lower risk of progression when displaying low 473 levels of the unique Dex-Spi-downregulated genes, which may altogether be predictive of the 474 clinical relevance of a combination treatment. In addition, patients having high MR expression 475 levels at diagnosis showed superior OS, while GR expression levels were not predictive for 476 survival (Fig.4O-P). For GR, this contrasts a previous study, where high expression levels at 477\ndiagnosis were found predictive for OS62. One reason for this difference may be that Rosen 478 and colleagues stratified patients in two subgroups, based on whether they underwent stem 479 cell transplantation or not, and another reason may be that at that time only version IA13 of 480 the database was available (with 650 patients vs. IA14 with 750 patients). 481 Our study of the proteome additionally revealed that metabolic hallmarks such as 482 oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism were upregulated, while the hallmark 483 cholesterol homeostasis was downregulated most by the Dex-Spi combination treatment (Fig. 484 7D-E). Reports in several lymphoid malignant cell types have associated enhanced 485 metabolism, i.e. increased glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, cholesterol biosynthesis and 486 fatty acid oxidation, with decreased GC responsiveness or even GC resistance63\u201365. GCs 487 inhibit glycolysis in ALL cells, which is not sufficient to trigger cell death but does induce a 488 metabolic shift to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to obtain survival energy66. In line 489 with this, combining GCs with the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor oligomycin sensitized 490 GC-resistant ALL cells to cell killing64. This team also found synergistic cell killing in GC 491 resistant ALL cell lines when GCs were combined with an inhibitor of cholesterol metabolism 492 (simvastatin)64. In CLL cells, GCs reduce metabolic activity among others by downregulating 493 pyruvate kinase M2 and decreasing levels of pyruvate. Concomitantly however, this elevated 494 the dependency of the CLL cells on fatty acid oxidation because GCs also upregulated PPARa 495 and PDK4 expression65. Based on these studies, increased oxidative phosphorylation and 496 fatty acid metabolism may be rather an unwanted feature of the Dex-Spi combination 497 treatment in a context of prolonged treatment, although this requires further investigation. 498 Within this context, our survival analysis (Fig.7I) supports that high expression of proteins that 499 were uniquely upregulated by Dex-Spi was indeed associated with worse PFS. In contrast, 500 the marked inhibition of cholesterol homeostasis observed solely with Dex-Spi treatment may 501 rather be a contributing mechanism that can drive and explain the enhanced myeloma cell 502 killing. Nonetheless, the connection between GCs and potential shifts in metabolism in 503 myeloma cells, especially in the context of prolonged treatment, is rather understudied, which 504 opens opportunities for follow-up research. 505 Concerning markers mimicking GC-related side effects, we have found that Dex-Spi 506 increases TMEM119 mRNA levels in all myeloma cell lines, except in MM1.R (Supplementary 507 Fig.S6D-H). Because this gene supports osteoblast differentiation and bone formation67,68, this 508 suggests that Dex-Spi may improve GC-induced osteoporosis. We have also shown that 509 REDD1 (DDIT4), an instigator of myeloma cell growth and survival48, is decreased by Dex-Spi 510 combination compared to Dex in MM1.S and OPM-2 (Fig.6D). Because GC-mediated 511 increases in REDD1 levels were also shown to contribute to muscle atrophy69, this suggests 512 that Dex-Spi may perhaps improve GC-induced muscle atrophy. Whether those and other 513 metabolic side effects could also be improved at the organism level remains to be investigated 514 in follow-up studies. 515 We discovered that Spi enhances Dex-induced cell killing of myeloma cells, i.e. in 516 GC-sensitive MM1.S and OPM-2 cells as well as in patient cells of several newly diagnosed 517 patients and a smoldering MM patient (Fig.2, Fig.3A, Fig.4A,B,K). Our findings agree with a 518 study in which a GC-treated pre-B lymphoma cell line stably overexpressing the N-terminal 519 domain (NTD) of MR resulted in blocked apoptosis70. In our case, Spi addition partially 520 suppressed Dex-induced GR-MR heterodimer formation and abolished Dex-induced MR-MR 521 homodimerization, which may form a molecular basis to support differential gene and protein 522 expression profiles with enhanced anti-myeloma outcomes compared to Dex. Noteworthy, Spi 523 is a potent FDA-approved MR antagonist, however, less selective because it causes anti-524 androgenic (via AR) and progestogenic (via progesterone receptor, PR) side effects as well 525\nas hyperkalemia20. A limitation of our study is that we did not include a more selective MR 526 antagonist, such as Eplerenone, mainly because this compound has a 40-fold lower affinity 527 for MR than Spi20. Nonetheless, Spi did not require GR for its action, because GR-negative 528 MM1.R cells underwent ~30% cell killing upon Spi treatment (Fig.3D). Data show that Spi by 529 itself can suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce apoptosis in blood mononuclear 530 cells by reducing NF-kB and c-myc activities60. Spi was also found to inhibit nucleotide 531 excision repair which resulted in increased sensitivity of (primary) myeloma cells to alkylating 532 agents such as melphalan71. Our study further supports a marked reduction in cell viability 533 observed upon 10-5M Spi monotherapy across all (patient-derived) MM cells (Fig.2-4). 534 In conclusion, our results support the high potential of MR as an additional therapeutic 535 target in myeloma, of which antagonists may be repurposed for myeloma treatment in 536 combination with GCs as add-on to the myeloma standard of care treatment. We showed that 537 a functional crosstalk between GR and MR exists in myeloma and that a targeting hereof with 538 ligands warrants further investigation of its potential therapeutic benefit in terms of efficacy, 539 safety and the possibility to reduce the GC-dose. 540 541 Materials and Methods 542 543 Cell lines and reagents. 544 MM1.S, OPM-2, L-363, U-266 and MM1.R cells were cultured in RPMI1640 GlutaMAX and 545 HEK293T and EA.hy926 cells in DMEM, both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 546 (FBS), 100U/mL penicillin and 0.1mg/mL streptomycin and grown at 5% CO2 and 37\u00b0C. 547 MM1.S, MM1.R and EA.hy926 were purchased from ATCC. OPM-2 were kindly provided by 548 Prof. B. Thompson (University of Texas Medical Branch) and L-363 and U-266 cells by Prof. 549 M. Engelhardt (Uniklinik Freiburg, Germany). HEK293T were obtained from the cytokine 550 receptor lab (Ghent University). All cell lines were mycoplasma negative (MycoAlert kit, 551 Lonza). Experiments were performed using charcoal-stripped serum (CTS), unless otherwise 552 specified. 553 Total solvent concentrations were equal in all conditions. Dex, Hydrocortisone (Hcort), 554 Prednisolone (Pred), fluocinolone acetonide (FA), Aldosterone (Ald), RU486 and 555 cycloheximide (CHX) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and dissolved in ethanol (EtOH), 556 unless otherwise specified. Spi and Chloroquine (CQ) were obtained from Santa Cruz 557 Biotechnology and dissolved in respectively EtOH and water, unless otherwise specified. 558 MG132 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals and dissolved in DMSO. Flag-GR has been 559 described before72 and the GFP-MR construct was a kind gift from Dr. H. Tanaka (University 560 of Tokyo, Japan). 561 562 siRNA nucleofection 563 MM1.S cells were transfected with siCtrl, siGR or siMR (see Supplementary Table S2) in 564 24-well plates by nucleofection using cell line nucleofector kit V and the nucleofector device 565 at program X01. 48h post-nucleofection, cells were reseeded to 96-well plates and treated for 566 another 24h with compounds (details in Fig. legends). 567 568 NanoBiT-based homo-and heterodimerization assays 569 HEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates in 10%FBS DMEM and transfected 24h later 570 with 2.5ng pLgBiT-MR and 2.5ng pGR-SmBiT (GR-MR heterodimerization assay) or 1.5ng 571 pLgBiT-GR and 1.5ng pGR-SmBiT (GR-GR homodimerization assay) or 1ng pLgBiT-MR and 572 1ng pMR-SmBiT (MR-MR homodimerization assay) using calcium phosphate precipitation. 573\n24h later, the Nano-Glo\u00ae Live Cell reagent was reconstituted (Promega) and 25\u00b5L was added 574 to the transfected cells, after which the baseline luminescence was measured for 15min 575 (continuous mode, 1min intervals) using an Envision (Perkin Elmer) spectrophotometer. 576 Subsequently, ligands were added (see Fig. legends) and the luminescence was measured 577 in a time window of 60min (continuous mode, 1min intervals). Luminescence counts were 578 normalized to baseline and set as a fold-difference versus the solvent condition (here: DMSO). 579 The area under the curve method was used to statistically compare Dex and Dex-Spi 580 conditions. 581 582 RT-qPCR 583 Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription (RT) was 584 performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The resulting cDNA served as 585 template for the quantitative PCR (qPCR) reaction, for which Lightcycler 480 SYBR Green I 586 Master mix (Roche diagnostics) was used. Primer sequences are available in Supplementary 587 Table S3. Cq values were analyzed using qBasePlus (Biogazelle) and normalized to the 588 reference genes SDHA, RPL13A and YWHAZ. 589 590 RNA-sequencing 591 Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The RNA-seq library was 592 prepared using the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA library kit, followed by single-end 100 bp 593 sequencing on a Illumina NOVASeq 600 instrument (VIB Nucleomics core), yielding 19-27 594 million reads per sample. Briefly, sequencing reads were quality controlled with FastQC 595 (version 0.11.9) and trimmed using Trim-Galore (version 0.6.6-0) to remove low-quality ends 596 (phred score <30) as well as adapters, followed by another quality control of the trimmed data. 597 Thereafter, reads were pre-mapped to PhiX genome using STAR (version 2.7.6a) and the 598 resulting PhiX-unmapped reads were aligned to the human genome GRCh38. The position-599 sorted output BAM files were converted to count data using HTSeq (version 0.12.4) in the 600 \u2018union\u2019 mode. Differential gene expression analysis was performing using DESeq2 R package 601 (version 1.34.0), using an interaction model (design formula: c0x0 + c1x1 + c2x2 + c3x1x2). As 602 input for the analysis, only genes with counts > 1 were withheld. Normalized counts were 603 either plotted per gene or were compared for all genes, clustered, and presented as heatmaps 604 (pheatmap package, version 1.0.12). Pairwise comparisons between differentially treated 605 samples (e.g. Dex-Spi vs EtOH) as well as the interaction term were retrieved at a significance 606 level of a= 0.05, corresponding to Wald-test adjusted p-value (FDR) cutoff (padj). Volcano plots 607 were made depicting the padj (log10 scale) in function of the log2FC for all genes with 608 baseMean \u00b350 in the interaction term and each pairwise comparison of interest. Functional 609 annotations of differentially expressed genes were performed using Ingenuity Pathway 610 Analysis (IPA) or gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA, using standard parameters)73. 611 612 Protein lysates and Western blotting (WB) 613 Protein lysates were prepared using Totex lysis buffer, as described before36, loaded on an 614 SDS-PAGE gel, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The list of primary 615 antibodies can be found in Supplementary Table S4. Note that the primary MR antibody is of 616 a non-commercial source and hence different batches were used throughout the course of 617 this research (clone 6G1, kind gift Dr. Gomez-Sanchez). As secondary antibodies, we used 618 species-specific HRP-conjugated antibodies (cat nr: NA931, NA934, GE-Healthcare). To 619 visualize results, Pierce ECL (Plus) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Westernbright Quantum or 620\nSirus (Isogen), or ECL Prime (GE Healthcare) served as chemiluminescent substrates and 621 signals were developed using X-Ray films or imaged on a ProXima 2850 (Isogen) or 622 Amersham 680 (GE healthcare) imaging system. Band densitometric analyses were 623 performed using ImageJ. 624 625 Shotgun proteomics 626 MM1.S were treated for 24h with compounds (see Fig. legends), after which the cells were 627 collected by washing with ice-cold PBS and storing the cell pellets at -80\u00b0C. Four biological 628 replicates were performed. The mass spectrometry sample preparation and computational 629 analysis were performed as previously described52. 630 631 Co-immunoprecipitation 632 Post-treatment, MM1.S or OPM-2 cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 633 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40) and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-GR G5 634 antibody, as described before74. Briefly, cell lysates were precleared with immobilized protein 635 A dynabeads (50\u00b5L bead slurry, with f.c. 2mg/mL BSA) by 1h rotation at 4\u00b0C. Ensuing, 100-636 150\u00b5g total protein was combined with anti-GR G5 antibody (sc-393232) and rotated for 1h at 637 4\u00b0C, after which immobilized dynabeads (50\u00b5L bead slurry, with f.c. 2mg/mL BSA) were added 638 followed by another 2h rotation at 4\u00b0C. Following washing steps, the bead-mixtures were 639 denatured for 5min at 95\u00b0C using 4xLaemli buffer supplemented with DTT (f.c. 200mM). 640 Samples were subjected to WB analyses and anti-MR 6G1 antibody (kind gift Dr. Gomez-641 Sanchez) was used to assay the interaction between immunoprecipitated GR and MR. 642 643 Flow cytometry 644 MM1.S cells were resuspended in Annexin-binding buffer and between 105 and 5x105 cells 645 were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Annexin V and propidium iodide (Molecular Probes by 646 Invitrogen). Unstained and single stained cells served as controls. Samples were measured 647 on an Attune Nxt flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data analysis was performed 648 using FlowJo; the gating strategy is depicted in Supplementary Fig.S3b. 649 650 Cell viability assays 651 MM cells were seeded and treated immediately with compounds for 24h or 72h (see Fig. 652 legends). Thereafter, cells were subjected to a CellTiterGlo cell viability assay (Promega), as 653 described before36. Briefly, the reconstituted CellTiterGlo reagent (Promega) was added in a 654 1:1 ratio to the cells, and contents were mixed for 2min on an orbital sharker. Following signal 655 stabilization (10min), luminescence was recorded using a Spectramax Paradigm (Beckman 656 Coulter), Envision or Ensight (Perkin Elmer) spectrophotometer. 657 658 Patient-derived MM cells 659 Sample acquisition was approved by the ethical commission of the Ghent University Hospital 660 (EC UZG 2018/0906) and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Bone marrow 661 aspirates were filtered through a cell strainer and mixed with a RosetteSep human MM cell 662 enrichment cocktail (negative selection, STEMCELL Technologies). Afterwards, bone marrow 663 aspirates were diluted 1:1 with PBS (+ 2% FBS) and layered on a Lymphoprep gradient using 664 SepMate tubes (STEMCELL Technologies). After centrifugation, the cells were washed twice 665 with PBS (+ 2%FBS) and with a red blood cell lysis buffer (0.8% NH4Cl, 0.1mM EDTA, 666\nSTEMCELL technologies). Thereafter, the enriched MM cells were resuspended in RPMI1640 667 GlutaMAX (+10%CTS) and subjected to a cell viability assay and/or RNA isolation. 668 669 Survival analysis 670 A publicly available dataset was used to evaluate the prognostic significance of set of 671 genes/proteins identified via RNA-sequencing or shotgun proteomics. Specifically, the 672 Relating Clinical Outcomes in MM to Personal Assessment of Genetic Profile (CoMMpass) 673 trial release IA14 was used, launched by the MM research foundation (MMRF). Normalized 674 TPM gene expression values, generated using RNA-sequencing, were downloaded alongside 675 clinical data through the MMRF research portal (https://research.themmrf.org). Overall 676 survival (OS) was defined as the time from diagnosis until death from any cause or until the 677 time point the patient was last known to be alive. In the latter case patients were censored. 678 Progression free survival (PFS) delineates the time from treatment initiation until relapse or 679 death from any cause. Patients were divided in 2 or 3 groups based on the average of their 680 z-score normalized expression data, ranked from low to high (2 groups) or from low to medium 681 to high (3 groups). Survival analysis of the CoMMpass cohort was performed using using R 682 (package survival, V3.5-3); statistical significance was calculated using the log-rank test. 683 Prognostic factor analysis was done using SigCheck package (V2.28.0), running with standard 684 parameters. 685 686 Statistical analyses 687 Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 or R, as specified in the figure 688 legends. Sample size calculations were not performed upfront. Experiments were performed 689 in at least three independent repetitions, as detailed in the figure legends, except for 690 experiments involving patient material, which could only be performed once because of the 691 limited culturing time and yield of the isolated primary cells. Error bars represent the standard 692 error of the mean (SEM), except for experiments involving primary patient material, where the 693 error bars represent the standard deviation (SD). When the means of 2 groups were compared 694 a two-tailed independent Student\u2019s t-test was used, when the means of more than 2 groups 695 were compared a one-way or two-way ANOVA with (Tukey\u2019s or Sidak\u2019s) multiple comparisons 696 post-test was used, as detailed in the figure legends. Normal distribution and equality of 697 variances were assumed. Statistical significance in survival curve estimates were calculated 698 using the log-rank test. When P < 0.05, results were designated significant: * = P < 0.05, ** = 699 P < 0.01, *** = P < 0.001, **** = P < 0.0001, ns = non-significant. 700 701 Data availability 702 The datasets used in this study are available in the following databases: RNA-seq data in the 703 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number GSE200313; shotgun 704 proteomics data are scheduled for deposit to the Proteomics Identification (PRIDE) database. 705 706 Acknowledgements 707 DC was funded by a predoctoral fellowship from Flanders Innovation and Entrepreneurship 708 (VLAIO), grant number 131374 (www.vlaio.be) until December 2017.

In GC-resistant cells, where GR is either absent or transcriptionally (in)active, 1011 Dex loses its anti-MM activity, while Spi addition does trigger significant MM cell killing. 1012 1013 Data information: (A-D) Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 using two-way 1014 ANOVA with post-hoc testing. 1015 1016\nFig. 4 1017 1018\n1019 1020 1021\nFig. 4: Combining lower doses of Dex with the MR antagonist Spi enhances cell killing in primary 1022 myeloma cells depending on the disease stage. 1023 (A-H) Patient-derived MM cells from bone marrow aspirates of (A-C) newly diagnosed, (D-H) relapsed 1024 or MM patients were treated with a Dex concentration range (10-6M-10-8M), Spi (10-5M), a Dex-Spi 1025 combination or solvent control (EtOH) for 24h (A, C-G) or 72h (B, H), followed by a CelltiterGlo cell 1026 viability assay. 1027 (I-J) When the primary cell yield was sufficient, primary MM cells were treated for 6h with Dex (10-6M) 1028 or solvent control, followed by RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analyses to determine the expression levels 1029 of TSCD22D3 (GILZ) and SGK1. Data analyses were performed using qBaseplus with SDHA, RPL13A 1030 and YWHAZ serving as reference genes. The bar plots represent the mean +/- SD of 3 technical 1031 replicates. Overall, no statistical analyses were performed because only 1 biological replicate could be 1032 carried out given the limited culturing time of primary MM cells isolated from a BM aspirate. 1033 (K-L) Patient-derived MM cells from bone marrow aspirates of premalignant (smoldering MM or MGUS) 1034 myeloma patients were treated with a Dex concentration range (10-6M-10-8M), Spi (10-5M), a Dex-Spi 1035 combination or solvent control (EtOH) for 24h (L) or 48h (K) followed by a CelltiterGlo cell viability 1036 assay. 1037 (M) Graphical summary demonstrating that primary MM cells isolated at diagnosis undergo profound 1038 Dex-mediated cell killing, while the addition of Spi to a 10-fold lower Dex dose triggers more extensive 1039 cell killing, although not the same extent in all patients. In the relapsed setting, Dex is unable to induce 1040 significant primary MM cell killing, while Spi triggers a substantial MM cell killing response. The extent 1041 of the described cell killing effects varies from patient to patient, due to interpatient heterogeneity, which 1042 is well known in MM. 1043 (N) TPM (transcripts per million) gene expression values, generated via RNA-sequencing, of NR3C2 1044 and NR3C1 in the CoMMpass cohort; only samples at diagnosis were taken along. 1045 (O-P) Kaplan-Meier curve of the MMRF patient cohort, depicting the survival probability in function of 1046 overall survival (OS) for low, medium or high expression of (O) NR3C2 or (P) NR3C1. Statistical 1047 analyses were performed in R (package survival), using a log-rank test. 1048 1049 Data information: (A-H, K-L) Each data point represents the mean +/- SD of technical replicates 1050 because only one biological repetition could be performed with the primary myeloma cells. The solvent 1051 condition was set as 100% and the other conditions were recalculated accordingly. Full arrows highlight 1052 the effect of the combination of a 10-fold lower Dex dose with Spi, while dashed arrows indicate the 1053 effect of Spi alone. 1054 1055 1056\nFig. 5 1057 1058\n1059 1060\nFig. 5: Crosstalk between GR and MR may result from an endogenous interaction that can be 1061 modulated with ligands. 1062 (A) NanoBiT-based GR-MR heterodimerization assay. The Large BiT (LgBiT) and Small BiT (SmBiT) 1063 fragments of the NanoLuc\u00ae luciferase, which have very low affinity for each other, are coupled to MR 1064 (at the N-terminus) or GR (at the C-terminus), respectively, and transfected into HEK293T cells. When 1065 the addition of ligand promotes GR-MR heterodimerization, the LgBiT and SmBiT come in close 1066 proximity of each other, hereby reconstituting the functional NanoLuc\u00ae luciferase. Following substrate 1067 addition (furimazine, cell-permeable substrate), the bioluminescent signal can be measured in intact 1068 cells. This NanoBiT-based assay was expanded to also measure GR-GR and MR-MR 1069 homodimerization. In both cases, LgBiT was coupled to the N-terminus and SmBiT to the C-terminus 1070 of both respective receptors. 1071 (B-C) HEK293T cells were transfected with LgBiT-MR and GR-SmBiT. 24h post-transfection, substrate 1072 is added and the baseline luminescence is recorded. Thereafter, cells are treated with Dex (10-6M), Spi 1073 (10-5M), the combination thereof, or solvent control and luminescence is measured continuous during 1074 60min (1min intervals) (N=3). (C) Statistical comparison of the area under the curve of Dex vs Dex-Spi 1075 NanoBiT results in panel B (N=3). 1076 (D-G) Two myeloma cell lines, i.e. (D) MM1.S and (H) OPM-2 cells were treated with Dex (10-6M), Spi 1077 (10-5M), a Dex-Spi combination or solvent control for 30min. Protein lysates were prepared and 1078 subjected to endogenous immunoprecipitation using GR (G5) antibody (both cell lines N=2). Thereafter, 1079 WB analyses were performed to determine co-immunoprecipitation of GR (90-95kDa) with MR 1080 (107kDa). GAPDH served as loading control for the input fraction. Lane 1 represents the non-specific 1081 antibody control. (E, G) In the IP fraction, MR protein levels were quantified relative to GR protein levels 1082 by band densitometric analysis using ImageJ. The bar plot displays the ratio of MR/GR in the IP fraction 1083 averaged over both biological repetitions (+/ SEM). 1084 (H-K) HEK293T cells were transfected with (H) LgBiT-GR and GR-SmBiT, or (J) LgBiT-MR and MR-1085 SmBiT. 24h post-transfection, substrate is added and the baseline luminescence is recorded. 1086 Thereafter, cells are treated with Dex (10-6M), Spi (10-5M), the combination thereof, or solvent control 1087 and luminescence is measured continuous during 60min (1min intervals) (N=3). (I, K) Statistical 1088 comparison of the area under the curve of Dex vs Dex-Spi NanoBiT results in panel H and J (N=3). 1089 1090 Data information: (D, H) One representative image is shown for each co-IP experiment; the other 1091 biological replicates are available for consultation in Supplementary Fig.5. 1092 1093\nFig. 6 1094 1095\n1096\nFig. 6: c-Myc and its target genes are inhibited most by Dex-Spi treatment, while a subset of 1097 Dex-Spi downregulated genes may predict prognosis. 1098 (A, C) MM1.S cells were treated with Dex (10-6M), Spi (10-5M), a Dex-Spi combination or solvent control 1099 (EtOH) for 6h, followed by RNA-seq analysis. (A, C) Volcano plots depicting the padj (log10 scale) in 1100 function of the log2FC for all genes with baseMean \u00b350 for (A) the pairwise comparison Dex-Spi vs 1101 EtOH or (C) the interaction term genes (= those for which the response following Dex-Spi treatment is 1102 significantly different from combining the separate responses of Dex and Spi). Significantly regulated 1103 genes (padj<0.05) are colored in red (log2FC>1 in A, log2FC>0 for C, upregulated) or blue (log2FC<-1 1104 in A, log2FC<0 for C, downregulated); non-significant genes (padj>0.05) in grey. The gene names are 1105 displayed for those genes having the largest abs(log2FC) values (top 10 upregulated/downregulated). 1106 The dashed lines are set at abs(log2FC)=1. 1107 (B, D) MM1.S and OPM-2 cells were treated with Dex (10-6M), Spi (10-5M), a Dex-Spi combination or 1108 solvent control (EtOH) for 24h (both N=3). Protein lysates were prepared and subjected to WB analyses, 1109 hereby assessing the protein levels of (P-Ser2) RNA-Pol2 (240kDa), GR (90-95kDa), c-myc (57-1110 65kDa), cyclin D1 (36kDa), MIP-1a (CCL3, 10kDa), DDIT4 (35kDa), IRE1a (110-130kDa) and BOB-1 1111 (35kDa). GAPDH (37kDa) and Tubulin (55kDa) served as loading controls. 1112 (E, G) Venn-diagram of three pairwise comparisons, split up in genes that were either (E) upregulated 1113 or (G) downregulated. In addition, the normalized gene expression profiles of the genes that are 1114 uniquely regulated by Dex-Spi are shown. 1115 (F, H, I) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of single hallmarks, i.e. (F) a GR activity signature and 1116 (H, I) two sets of Myc target genes (V1, V2), for each pairwise comparison, along with the respective 1117 normalized enrichment score (NES) and padj. 1118 (J) Kaplan-Meier curve of the MMRF patient cohort (N=750), depicting the survival probability in function 1119 of progression-free survival (PFS) for low or high expression of genes that were uniquely downregulated 1120 by the Dex-Spi combination. Statistical analyses were performed in R (package survival), using a log-1121 rank test. 1122 (K) Prognostic factor analysis of the genes uniquely downregulated Dex-Spi (red solid curve) versus 1123 random signatures (red dotted curve). Prognostic power as determined by SigCheck (R package) of 1124 the genes uniquely downregulated by Dex-Spi (red dotted line) with 1000 random gene-sets of the 1125 same size (P value <0.05 is indicated by the red dotted line) for the overall survival parameter in the 1126 CoMMpass cohort. 1127 1128 Data information: (B, D) One representative image is shown for each WB experiment, with the number 1129 of biological replicates mentioned in each panel description. 1130 1131\nFig. 7 1132 1133\n1134 1135 1136\nFig. 7: Several metabolic pathways are deregulated most by the Dex-Spi combination treatment. 1137 (A) MM1.S cells were treated with Dex (10-6M), Spi (10-5M), a Dex-Spi combination or solvent control 1138 (EtOH) for 24h, followed by MS-based shotgun proteomics. Venn-diagram of pairwise comparisons in 1139 which significantly regulated proteins (-log(padj)\u00b31.3) with a abs(log(LFQ difference))>1 were 1140 considered. 1141 (B) Volcano plot depicting the padj (log10 scale) in function of the log(LFQ) in the pairwise comparison 1142 Dex-Spi vs EtOH. Significantly regulated proteins -log(padj)\u00b31.3 are colored in red (log(LFQ)>1, 1143 upregulated) or blue (log(LFQ)<-1, downregulated); non-significant genes (-log(padj)<1.3) in grey. 1144 (C) GSEA-based overrepresentation analysis for the proteins regulated by Dex-Spi, hereby identifying 1145 hallmarks that are significantly (red) or non-significantly (grey) enriched. 1146 (D-G) GSEA of single hallmarks, i.e. (D) oxidative phosphorylation, (E) fatty acid metabolism, (F) 1147 cholesterol homeostasis or (G) E2F targets, for each pairwise comparison, along with the respective 1148 normalized enrichment score (NES) and padj. 1149 (H-I) Kaplan-Meier curves of the MMRF patient cohort (N=750), depicting the survival probability in 1150 function of progression-free survival (PFS) for low or high expression of proteins that were uniquely (H) 1151 downregulated or (I) upregulated by the Dex and Spi combination. Statistical analyses were performed 1152 in R (package survival), using a log-rank test. 1153 (J) Several lines of evidence support a crosstalk between GR and MR in MM: A) GCs induce a GR-1154 dependent MR downregulation; B) GR and MR engage in a direct, physiologically relevant endogenous 1155 interaction that can be modulated by ligands. Spi was shown to reduce the Dex-induced GR-MR 1156 heterodimer levels and abolished Dex-induced MR-MR homodimers. Spi did not impact Dex-induced 1157 GR-GR homodimerization; C) Dex and Spi combination gives rise to a differential gene and protein 1158 expression profile, in which the inhibition of c-myc and its target genes, and several metabolic pathways 1159 are modulated most pronounced by Dex-Spi, respectively. A specific subset of targets may even have 1160 prognostic significance; D) MR inhibition enhances GC-induced cell killing in MM cell lines depending 1161 on their GC responsiveness and in primary (heterogeneous) MM cells depending on the disease stage. 1162 1163 1164\nTables 1165 1166\nTable 1: Patient demographics and disease stage.
