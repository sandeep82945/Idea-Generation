After selection of the indicators, the Mental Health Matrix was adopted as a suggestion for their development and application in the Brazilian Psychosocial Care Network. The matrix was prepared in two dimensions, respecting the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the indicators studied, as follows: geographical (national/regional, local, individual), and time (entry, process and results). Results: the analysis indicates 41 indicators that presented diverse evidence regarding their use. All were allocated in the Mental Health Matrix, contributing as a metric to analyze the purpose of the Mental Health services, in the levels and phases of each dimension. Conclusion: the indicators selected, distributed in the different Mental Health Matrix dimensions, are being made available for their use in management and in the clinical practice, as well as for scientific studies and, in the future, to be used as definers of Mental Health policies.\nDescriptors: Health Status Indicators; Healthcare Quality Indicator; Public Health Administration; Mental Health Services; Health Planning Guidelines; Health Facility Administration.\nOriginal Article\nRev.

            "text": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people with mental disorders have disproportionately high disability and mortality rates. Individuals with major depression or schizophrenia have from 40% to 60% more chances of premature death than the general population, due to physical comorbidities that are not investigated in different situations (tumors, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, HIV infection)(1). Worldwide, suicide is the second most frequent cause of death among young people. Based on these facts, the WHO proposed a set of actions and goals for the member countries to adapt to their needs, seeking to change these rates. Thus, the WHO proposal emphasizes that leadership, governance and efficacy in Mental Health (MH) actions are to be strengthened, providing encompassing, adapted and responsive MH and social services at all care levels, strengthened by the information systems and by the results of research studies in this area(2).\nFor the WHO, one of the principles of these technologies is how the indicators can significantly synthesize the information for a particular phenomenon, portray a situation and, therefore, be used to evaluate an established and current situation or propose some change. The overall intentions established by the WHO provide the basis for assessing the Member States\u2019 collective actions and achievements in relation to the global goals, but should not prevent establishing more ambitious national purposes(2).\nA recent review study, pointing to the global panorama on the use of Mental Health Indicators (MHIs), analyzed 22 articles that presented the countries\u2019 attempts to select or implement MHIs. However, the results shown evidence different uses of these indicators to improve policies, management and services. However, some countries are still committed to the process of discussions, survey and collection of fundamental indicators. Some other initiatives from other countries were in an incomplete implementation process or in the implementation of pilot projects, highlighting that these indicators\u2019 capability is still unexplored. It is noteworthy that in low- and middleincome countries, the research studies on MHIs were conducted with many objections, due to the absence of essential MH services, financial conditions, legislation and/ or political disposition, or even lack of guidelines for MH data management and integration(3-7).\nA study carried out in 2016 sought to identify MHIs to assess effective treatment coverage in MH. The Delphi study method was applied in two rounds (with 93 specialists from different countries, mainly middleand low-income, such as: Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda). They initiated selection with a set of 876 indicators, finishing with 15 well-ranked. The\nstudy provided data on how the MH service and financial coverage can be assessed in low- and middle-income countries(4).\nIn the Netherlands in 2013, a research study sought to develop a set of performance indicators that were executable, expressive and pertinent to assess the quality of the MH public system in Amsterdam. The study was initiated with 330 indicators, reaching the end with 56 indicators selected, based on an international questionnaire and presented to the parties participating in the process(5). Another similar study was carried out in Germany. The researchers sought to describe the development of quality indicators for a quality-proof procedure for adult patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizotypal disorders with delusions(7).\nIn Brazil, Ordinance 3,088 of 12/23/2011 created the Psychosocial Care Network (Rede de Aten\u00e7\u00e3o Psicossocial, RAPS) for people with mental alterations or disorders and with demand arising from the use of crack, alcohol and other substances, establishing a group of activities and actions in the Unified Health System (Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade, SUS)(8). The following is evidenced as general purposes of this network: articulation and aggregation of the points of care of the health networks in the towns, evaluating care through welcoming, constant follow-up and emphasis on urgencies(8).\nThe SUS scope includes the RAPS, comprised as follows(8): Primary Health Care (Basic Health Units); Specialized Psychosocial Care (Centros de Aten\u00e7\u00e3o Psicossocial, CAPS); Urgency and Emergency Care (24-hour Emergency Care Units, Unidades de Pronto Atendimento, UPAs); Residential Care of a transitory nature (collection units); and Hospital Care (psychiatric clinics and hospitals). With this, the RAPS is particularly complex, given that the therapeutic actions occur incorporated into the network with extensive communication with other heterogeneous and articulated systems. These actions are based on the principle of integrality, one of the basic procedures of the SUS, avoiding fragmentation and losses(9-10).\nThrough the Guidelines Notebook of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, in 2014, we only found one indicator for MH submitted by the Ministry of Health, in which it only proposed the national/regional coverage level of the CAPS, by population. Despite being relevant, it was not capable of evaluating the care practices offered in the different activities, or of estimating the efficiency of the service provided. Recently, this indicator has been discontinued by the Ministry of Health(8).\nIn the Interfederative Agreement document, for the 2017-2021 period, a new indicator was proposed for Systematic Matrix Support actions for the CAPS, with the professionals working in Primary Care, through\nwww.eerp.usp.br/rlae\nResolution No. 8. The proposal aimed at integrating MH care in Primary Care into the format of the international guidelines for the reorganization of the health systems(11).\nIt should be noted that in 2011, Ordinance No. 1,654 of July 19th, composed the National Program to Improve Access and Quality of Primary Care (Programa Nacional de Melhoria do Acesso e da Qualidade da Aten\u00e7\u00e3o B\u00e1sica, PMAQ-AB), notoriously intended for the Family Health Strategy (FHS). In the MH agenda, instructional and preventive actions are estimated, referring to the use of alcohol and other substances. In this ordinance, four indicators for MH were established, to be monitored monthly, namely: 1 - Proportion of MH appointments, except for alcohol and drug users; 2 - Proportion of alcohol user appointments; 3 - Proportion of drug user appointments; and 4 - Prevalence rate of alcoholism(12).\nDespite the important changes that took place in the structure of Brazilian MH organization in the last decades, a recent study(10) showed how MH is discussed in the Brazilian and international evaluation policies, through the manifestations presented in national (Ministry of Health) and international (World Health Organization) normative documents released in August 2015. In this study, the absence of official evaluation instruments for Brazil and the incipience of documents from the different countries analyzed are highlighted, where information has become one of the procedures used by the WHO to evaluate MH quality, through the MH Atlas and the Action Plan(9-10).\nGiven these facts and the absence of official MHIs in Brazil, the objective of this article is to propose Mental Health Indicators aimed at management of the Mental Health Care Network, starting with convergence of their use in countries with public health organization."

The intention is to modify science in practices, mapping diverse information on evidence-based interventions from peerelaborated literature for the context of a specific real environment(14)."

Thus, they encompass the search for clinical goals, the quality of professional and managerial care and the results obtained, as well as they assist in taking decisive actions, contributing to the improvement of the processes as a whole(17).\nElaboration of an indicator is a complex activity, which can range from basic and direct counting of cases of a specific disease to calculation of more elaborate proportions, ratios, rates or indices, such as life perspective at birth(18)."

The format determined by the Interagency Health Information Network (RIPSA)(8,18) was resorted to for this purpose, seeking the following items: Definition, Conceptualization, Source, Calculation Method and Category.\nThe MHM(40) was defined as a fundamental reference, as a heuristic guide in the addition and applicability of the MHIs, at different network management levels. 3 fundamental and inseparable axes are pointed out in this matrix example, namely: ethical conception; evidencebased practices; and accumulation of experiences(41).\nThe MHM also refers to a model that can be used to increase the clinical and management benefits. This model suggests two dimensions: a geographical one, divided into three levels: national/regional, local and individual (patient) and a time one, defined by three phases: entry, process and results(40).\nHealth policies stand out at the national/regional level; however, at the local level we find the services operating in a coverage area and in the latter (individual), the user of the service itself. The following can be identified\nin each phase of the matrix, for example: the resources applied (entry phase), the professional actions performed in the provision of care (process phase), and the expected results at the different levels in relation to the change in the morbidity and mortality rates and in the individual levels, as well as in the population (results phase).\nThe indicators referring to the results phase become more arduous to define and collect; in some circumstances, they can be confused with entry or process indicators. This is an example of the reduction in hospitalization time, categorized as a process indicator, which may constitute a results indicator at the individual level(41).\nWith this model, an important task of this study was to systematize the MHIs, according to the MHM specifications, its levels and phases, taking into account the ethical issues, the scientific cues and the analysis of the experience acquired as foundations of the MH system(40)."

Also for this selection\nprocess, criteria were established that allowed for a more\nspecific selection for inclusion and exclusion of indicators.\nIndicators Excluded - Of the indicators initially selected for analysis, 123 were excluded for not meeting the criteria specified in the method. A detailed breakdown of these exclusion criteria is included below: \u2022 1- 9 indicators excluded = 5.48% of 164\nfor representing specific interests of some countries (immigrants, ethnicities, etc.). \u2022 2- 69 (42.07%) were excluded for being part of\nindicators related to the Social Assistance Indicator that is already included in the MHI set). \u2022 3- 14 (8.53%) were excluded for being found in more\nthan 1 country.\n\u2022 4- 31 (18.90%) were excluded because they need\ninformation regarding self-assessment/application of an individual questionnaire.\nFrom selection of the MHI set (properly stratified in relation to their contents and uses)(42), we started allocating them in the MHM(40), according to their geographical dimension levels (national/regional, local and individual) and to the time dimension phases (entry, process and results).\nBy adhering to this heuristic, each indicator started to be associated as a metric to evaluate the purpose of the MH services, at the levels and phases of each dimension: geographical and time."

As an evaluation metric, these indicators should be understood as a \u201clens\u201d, making it possible to more clearly see the application and effectiveness of the MH laws and policies in force in the country. Organization of this level depends on whether the services are organized in health districts or sectors, or even by population coverage area. The relevant point of this level is verifying the need for the services to be locally organized (close to people\u2019s homes), in order to offer care in the community(40). As previously pointed out, this entry phase at the local level determines the budget of the local service and the balance of the hospital and community services, assessment of the needs of the local population, sizing of the clinical staff and combinations of clinical and non-clinical services, as well as work relationships among services.\nOne indicator was allocated in the Entry Phase of the Individual Level, 3A. The indicators in this position serve as measures of the care offered directly to patients with mental disorders, their family members and their close social contacts. The MH services that were evaluated from these indicators are generally understood as the health professional\u2019s exclusive territory, but the individual results may depend on what is defined at the national and local\nlevels. Greater focus on this level is due to the need for the practices and interventions to be evidence-based, as what is more frequently noticed is certain distance between what is suggested by the diverse evidence and the clinical practice(44). As previously established, at this level and in this phase, the intention is to assess the individual needs, requirements arising from the pathology, family demands for daily care, skills and knowledge of the team, content of clinical treatments and also the information for patients/caregivers(41)."

Thus, one of the purposes of this MHM-based model is that it can serve as a guide in the best possible diagnosis of the condition presented by the person and in management of the MH services, so that corrective actions can be applied at the appropriate levels to improve care. The model does not claim to be rigid for prescription, but should be considered as an instrument to be used in the analysis of possible problems and in assisting the decision-making process(41).\nIn order to broaden the discussion, it is worth mentioning the Donabedian Model, which provides a general structure to investigate health services and measure care\nGeographical Dimension Time Dimension\nC) Results Phase\n(1) National/Regional Level 1C 1.

Specifically,\nin this phase it is possible to identify suicide rates,\nhomeless rates (among the mentally-ill or mental illness\nrates among the homeless), prison rates (inadequate\nimprisonment of those who would be better treated\nin MH facilities), and special consultations (especially\nthose in extreme adverse events such as homicides by\npatients). Note the indicators in the Results Phase, in\nFigure 5.\nwww.eerp.usp.br/rlae\nquality(46-47). It is interesting to note that, according to this model, similarly to the approach outlined in the MHM, the best way to evaluate care quality is to select a set of representative indicators from three approaches, namely: \u201cstructure\u201d, \u201cprocess\u201d and \u201cresults\u201d(32). The Donabedian Model is cited here as another example of a matrix, in which the characteristics of the health practices and social organization are defined, namely: equality, coverage, user satisfaction, effectiveness, efficiency and accessibility(46-47). In his several health research studies on health, the author did not specifically propose a model for MH; however, his work supported constitution of the domains of the Australian MHI set(39), as well as it inspired the organization of the MHI set in England(38).\nUsing the MHM to allocate the indicators presents limitations, as a heuristic needs the user\u2019s interpretations, suggesting certain weakness in this interpretation, which may come to be applied in the continuity of these studies. Even so, this model serves to guide proper use of the MHIs, thus being able to instruct the use of these indicators in the different administrative dimensions of the Brazilian RAPS. The model focuses on assisting in the evaluation of the local services\u2019 strengths and weaknesses and on developing an Action Plan to improve them, offering a clear approach that is also flexible enough to be relevant to their local circumstances(44). By including the geographical dimension in the Matrix, it is perceived that the priority for organizing the MH services must be local, in order to be provided to the individuals in need. However, some of the main factors are decided regionally or nationally, based on the constant analyses of events related to the sector to define public policies and financial allocations, specific to MH(6).\nIn this way, it is possible to know the aspects that can contribute to a good result for each person with an acute or chronic mental disorder episode, assisted in the primary and secondary networks. While this result is often seen as a successful achievement for the practitioners at the individual level, in the practice this includes decisions made at the local level (for example: to provide home treatment services), which must be enabled by policies and resources, decided at the national level (for example: developing community care).\nThe limitations found when selecting the MHIs are related to the difficulties finding diverse information with evidence of the use of indicators (and even finding these indicators with updated information) in the databases studied or in the normative documents. It was observed that it is not necessary to select a large set of indicators but, rather, to encourage a search of those that really contribute to the objectives proposed. The countries that make use of MHIs have somewhat the same indicators.\nThe important thing is to obtain updated and\nobjective data from the use of these indicators in the MH\nservices and possible suggestions that can be adapted,\naiming at improvements in the quality of the care provided\nto the affected population, as well as in management\nof the services. Another limitation to consider is non-\nseparation of the indicators by categories, such as\ngender, age group, indigenous people, immigrants, street\npopulation, LGBTQIA+ and so on. However, to minimize\nthis limitation, it is not necessary to include new indicators,\nonly to include the variables in the implementation process\nof each indicator.\nIn agreement with the authors(40-41), the MHM can\nbe interpreted as a map, which serves to help establish\nthe goals of the service and the main stages for its\nimplementation and evaluation. However, to be adequate,\nthis map must be simple and objective. Following this\nprinciple, the MHM was created with only two dimensions,\nconstituting a matrix model.\nThe issue of the MHIs for assisting people and\nmanaging the health network services offers a lot of\nroom for research proposals, application in the practice and establishment of public policies(48). Indeed, this set\nof indicators has application in producing evidence on a\nhealth scenario and its trends, based on experience, to\nidentify populations with greater health needs, establish\nepidemiological risk and identify critical areas. In this way,\nit contributes as an important tool to establish policies and\ntheir priorities, to improve the quality of the services and\nto adapt care protocols and measures that can provide\ndiverse information for MH promotion programs, as well\nas prevention and treatment of diseases with psychosocial\nrehabilitation of the chronic cases, seeking to better meet the needs of the population(49-51).\nAnalyzing possible implications of the results of this\npaper, it is noted that we are only at the beginning of\nthe research studies and proposals for the creation and\norganization of the MHIs aimed at the Brazilian RAPS, with\nall its complexity. Furthermore, the results contribute to\nthe semantic structuring of entities and relationships found\nin the Mental Health Management Ontology (MHMO), an\nontology for the Mental Health domain that maps clinical\nand biomedical aspects of this area and relates them to managerial processes of the care networks(52-53).\nThis fact intensifies our interest in improving this\nproposal and to test it in the services, seeking consensus\nand accompanied by research studies and publications.\nAs a future paper, we will submit the indicators selected\nin this study to the application of the Delphi Study to\nvalidate the results.\nwww.eerp.usp.br/rlae"

These indicators, allocated in the MHM; in the geographical dimensions: national, local and individual level; and in the time dimensions: entry phase: process phase and results phase; show possibilities and feasibility for their use in the Brazilian MH care network.\nThese indicators are important metrics at all RAPS levels and services, acting to show the conditions of management, incidence, prevalence, mortality and morbidity, allowing through their information that managers can intervene in the improvement of the entire network of services and even anticipate promotion and prevention measures in MH.\nDue to non-use of official MHIs in Brazil, it is expected that the results herein presented will be a stimulus for new research studies, as well as an aid for establishing policies aimed at the priorities, specific laws, quality of the services, adaptation of care protocols and measures that can provide diverse information to the MH programs, always seeking to better meet the needs of the population."
