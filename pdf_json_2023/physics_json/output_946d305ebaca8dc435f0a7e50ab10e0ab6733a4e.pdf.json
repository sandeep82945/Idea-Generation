The energetic cost to the M. mulieris bacterium in retaining such a large adhesin as a single gene or protein construct suggests a critical role in pathogenicity and/or persistence.\n1. Introduction\nBacteria occupy innumerable replicative niches, often within hostile environments in the human body. Their interactions with the environment are mediated by their surface structures, which include molecules collectively termed adhesins. These filamentous, \u2018sticky\u2019 appendages have critical roles in surface attachment and biofilm formation, and are particularly important in mediating host-cell interactions of pathogenic bacteria (Kline et al., 2009).\nIn Gram-positive bacteria, many of the cell-surface proteins are attached covalently to the cell wall by enzymes called sortases. These enzymes recognize a \u2018sorting\u2019 motif, typically LPxTG, near the C-terminus of the protein, cleave the polypeptide following the threonine residue and join the new C-terminus to the peptidoglycan layer with an isopeptide bond (Marraffini et al., 2006). A subset of these adhesins, typified by the adhesin from Streptococcus pyogenes, take the form of covalent polymers with individual subunits (pilins) covalently linked into chains by sortases that act as pilin polymerases (Kang & Baker, 2012). Others, typified by the adhesin from Clostridium perfringens, comprise a single gene or open reading frame (ORF) that produces an N-terminal adhesion domain followed by a long \u2018stalk\u2019, often with multiple repetitive protein domains arrayed like beads on a string (Patti et al., 1994; Baker et al., 2015). In both of these cases the repeat domains are variations on an Ig-like fold, a structure that is extremely versatile and is highly abundant in cell-surface receptors (Chen et al., 2018).\nThe discovery of intramolecular isopeptide-bond cross-links in the pilin protein Spy0128, which forms the repetitive polymerized backbone of pili expressed by S. pyogenes (Kang et al., 2007), showed how extremely long and thin surface proteins resist extreme environmental stress. Spy0128 comprises two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, each with a spontaneously formed isopeptide cross-link between lysine and asparagine side chains on adjacent \ufffd-strands. Similar bonds have since been found in the pili of many other Grampositive bacteria (Kang & Baker, 2012). While investigating their prevalence, we found a second type of covalent crosslink, this time involving ester bonds formed between threonine and glutamine side chains in the repetitive Ig-like domains of the C. perfringens adhesin Cpe0147 (Kwon et al., 2014). This protein comprises a single polypeptide with an N-terminal adhesion domain followed by 11 repeat Ig-like domains.\nThe intramolecular cross-links, whether isopeptide or ester bonds, stabilize the individual Ig-like domains and provide a covalently linked \u2018spine\u2019 the entire length of the protein stretching from the surface of the bacterium to the adhesion domain. Another feature of adhesins of these types is the frequent observation of a third type of post-translational modification: covalent thioester bonds between cysteine and glutamine side chains that provide a reactive \u2018warhead\u2019 within the thioester adhesin domains (TEDs) that mediate covalent bacterial adhesion (Walden et al., 2015). Adhesin surface proteins that combine thioester, isopeptide and ester bonds (TIE proteins) are widespread among Gram-positive bacteria (Miller et al., 2018).\nDespite considerable interest in the chemistry of bond formation (Kwon et al., 2014; Kang & Baker, 2011; Hagan et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2011) and in the use of these spontaneously formed bonds for applications in synthetic biology and biotechnology (Zakeri & Howarth, 2010; Young et al., 2017),\nthe extent of natural structural variation is largely unknown. The 11 sequential ester-bond domains of Cpe0147 show high sequence identity (Kwon et al., 2014). Following up on this work, we searched sequence databases and identified putative ester-bond-containing adhesins in the proteomes of Mobiluncus mulieris, M. curtisii and Varibaculum cambriense, bacteria that are most often associated with bacterial vaginosis (Spiegel & Roberts, 1984; Onderdonk et al., 2016).\nHere, we describe the structures of these adhesins, which are remarkably large, comprising single-chain molecules of up to 7651 amino-acid residues in length. We find that these adhesin molecules contain four covalent cross-link types, isopeptide, esther, disulfide and thioester bonds, verifying their presence by mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. This discovery raises intriguing questions as to the roles of these supersized adhesins in pathology and disease."

To enhance these predictions and to search for other domains in these proteins, the amino-acid sequences were submitted to the AlphaFold2 server for 3D structure prediction as detailed in Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S3 (Jumper et al., 2021; Varadi et al., 2022). The predicted structures were overlaid onto the crystal structures of proteins shown to contain ester bonds (Cpe0147; Kwon et al., 2014; PDB entry 4ni6), isopeptide bonds (Spy0128; Kang et al., 2007; PDB entry 3b2m) and thioester bonds (SaTIE; Miller et al., 2018; PDB entry 6fx6). This allowed us to map putative domain boundaries onto the full-length sequences of the Mobiluncus and Varibaculum proteins and to classify the domains according to their predicted cross-link types. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using Clustal Omega and were visualized using MView (Sievers et al., 2011; Brown et al., 1998)."

Subsequent 3D structure prediction using AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al., 2021; Varadi et al., 2022) corroborated the existence of 18 ester-bond cross-link domains in both the M. mulieris and M. curtisii proteins, which were mostly located in the C-terminal half of their respective sequences (Fig. 1).\nTo identify other domains in the remaining portions of the M. mulieris protein, we searched for additional Ig-like repeats using the amino-acid sequence of the isopeptide-containing C-terminal domain of the S. pyogenes pilin protein Spy0128. A combination of pairwise sequence alignments, internal multiple sequence alignment (Supplementary Fig. S3), manual inspection for characteristic sequence motifs and 3D structure prediction highlights the presence of an additional 33 intramolecular isopeptide-containing domains in the M. mulieris protein.

The native structure (Fig. 2) was then solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007). The molecules of the two space groups differ across 287 aligned C\ufffd coordinates by a rootmean-square difference (r.m.s.d.) of 1.78 A\u030a.

Structure determination and refinement statistics are provided in Tables 3 and 4.\nThe N-terminal 46E ester-bond domain structure closely overlays with the ester-bond domains of C. perfringens Cpe0147 (Kwon et al., 2014), with an r.m.s.d. of 1.88 A\u030a over 108 C\ufffd atoms (Fig. 2). An unambiguous intramolecular esterbond cross-link is seen to connect Thr6674 on the first \ufffd-strand of the domain fold to Gln6827 on the last \ufffd-strand. The 46E domain differs from adhesin stalk domain 1 of Cpe0147 only by the presence of an \ufffd-helical insertion and by a different orientation of the metal-binding loop. In the 46E domain, this loop folds back onto the protein, forming a two-stranded \ufffd-sheet, rather than presenting the extended metal-binding structure seen in Cpe0147.\nA short 2\u20133-amino-acid linker precedes the isopeptidecontaining 47I domain. As predicted, an isopeptide bond links the first and last \ufffd-strands of this domain, joining Lys6842 to Asn6955. There is clear homology between this domain and the second (smaller) isopeptide domain of the two-domain S. pyogenes pilin protein Spy0128 (Fig. 2). Superposition of the two structures affords an r.m.s.d. of 2.34 A\u030a over 102 C\ufffd atoms. The main differences between the 47I domain of M. mulieris\nand domain 2 of Spy0128 are a two-strand deletion from one \ufffd-sheet of the \ufffd-sandwich and a small additional \ufffd-strand (\ufffd-strand 7) associated with the opposite \ufffd-sheet (Fig. 2). The disulfide linkage between Cys6887 and Cys6895 identified by mass spectrometry in the 47I domain is not fully formed in the crystal structures, possibly as a result of radiation damage, and is consequently modelled at partial occupancy."

In contrast to the exemplar Cpe0147 structure (PDB entry 4ni6), the intramolecular ester bond between Thr6674 and Gln6827, although in a near-identical location, shows minor variations in the conformation of adjacent side chains and their interactions in 46E (Supplementary Fig. S7a). As in Cpe0147, a hydrogen-bonded pair of buried acidic residues (Glu6791 and Asp6698 in 46E) adjoins the ester bond, where they could contribute to the bond-forming reaction. In 46E, however, they do not directly interact with the resulting ester moiety. These acid residues have high predicted pKa values, indicating that both are protonated, again similarly to Cpe0147. All other accessory side chains are appropriately\nActa Cryst. (2023). D79, 971\u2013979 Paul G.

Whether this conserved disulfide contributes significantly to protein stability is not clear, although we note that a disulfide bond is found in a similar location in the isopeptide-domain structures of the Actinomyces oris fimbrial adhesin FimP and the A. naeslundii fimbrial adhesin FimA (PDB entries 3uxf and 3qdh, respectively; Persson et al., 2012; Mishra et al., 2011). The conformation of the disulfide bond in the M. mulieris structure has a high-energy and potentially reactive RH Staple conformation that can stabilize \ufffd-sheet structures by linking adjacent strands (Schmidt et al., 2006).\nThe isopeptide bond in the M. mulieris 47I domain is located at the C-terminal end of the domain and has an environment similar to that in the Spy0128 domain 2 structure (PDB entry 3b2m; Supplementary Fig. S7b). The hydrophobic environment around Lys6842, consisting of three aromatic side chains and a number of other nonpolar groups, would modify the pKa of its \"-amino group, enabling cross-link formation to proceed as previously outlined by Kang et al. (2007). In the M. mulieris domain, two acidic side chains form hydrogen bonds to the isopeptide bond, implying that their polarizing effect promotes bond formation. As for the esterbond site, both acidic side chains are predicted to have elevated pKa values and are hence mostly protonated."

Cell-surface adhesins typically comprise an N-terminal adhesion domain supported on a repetitive \u2018stalk\u2019 that projects the adhesive apparatus away from the bacterial surface. In our analysis of the M. mulieris and M. curtisii sequences, the N-terminal region preceding the first recognizable stalk domain is more than 2000 residues long. In searching for possible structured domains in this region, we again attempted to predict the structure using AlphaFold2. This revealed a thioester cross-link domain (TED) in both proteins. Secondary-structure and domain elements overlay well between the M. mulieris/M. curtisii and SaTIE proteins (Miller et al., 2018). Specifically, a conserved TQXX\u2019W motif, where \u2019 is aromatic, and a predicted thioester bond between Cys529 and Gln712 could contribute to host-cell adhesion (Supplementary Fig. S8). No adhesion domain nor any other predicted folded structure could be inferred for the V. cambriense protein."

While ester- and isopeptide-bond cross-links demonstrably provide structural stability towards chemical, proteolytic and mechanical stressors, including tensile and shear forces, a thioester bond is unlikely to provide protein stabilization, but would instead effect host-cell adhesion by covalently joining the adhesin protein to the target substrate. Thioester bonds are well characterized in a number of other bacterial cell-surface proteins with N-terminal TED domains and their importance in adhesion has been clearly demonstrated (Walden et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2018).\nFrom an evolutionary and protein-stability perspective, each intramolecular cross-link in the M. mulieris stalk domain is likely to protect the elongated, single-molecule-wide protein from tensile and shear forces, as well as from proteolytic action, by maintaining compact and rigid domain structures. Remarkable in this case is the extraordinary size of the M. mulieris adhesin as a single gene construct compared with polymerized pili such as the S. pyogenes Spy0128 adhesin. The retention of such an extended open reading frame suggests that the encoded protein has a vital role in the bacterial life cycle, perhaps in virulence or survival.\nThe conspicuous domain conservation of these large proteins in the M. mulieris and M. curtisii proteomes suggests a common ancestry. We presume that the evolutionary growth of these multi-domain proteins occurs via domain duplication through recombination either within the gene or between similar genes in the bacterium, or from external bacterial DNA sources. The major difference between the M. mulieris and M. curtisii proteins is the insertion of 21 additional isopeptide domains (Fig. 1). The second largest protein in the M. mulieris proteome is also a predicted LPxTG-motif cell-wall-anchored protein, for which 3D structure prediction (data not shown) provides a strong prediction of repetitive isopeptide-containing Ig-like domains (Table 5). This putative 2542-amino-acid isopeptide-rich protein could be the source of the isopeptide domains in the 7651-amino-acid protein. This argument is even more compelling in M. curtisii, as the second, third and fourth largest proteins encoded by this organism all appear to be cell-surface adhesins that are likely to contain isopeptide cross-linked domains (Table 5). We also predict that the largest protein in V. cambriense, a third bacterium isolated from bacterial vaginosis clinical samples, also possesses a mixed ester- and isopeptide-domain adhesin. At 3249 amino acids long, this putative adhesin shares 33% coverage and 11% sequence identity with the M. mulieris mixed adhesin (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S9). The oversized adhesins in all three of these bacteria may be a defining feature of Actinomyces bacteria that inhabit the vaginal mucosa.\nWhat might be the function of these super-sized adhesins in these bacteria? Oversized, single-protein adhesins are found in biofilm-forming bacteria living in extreme environments. Arguably the most extreme example is the bacterium Marinomonas primoryensis that survives attached to the underside\n978 Paul G. Young et al. \ufffd Giant adhesin from Mobiluncus mulieris Acta Cryst. (2023). D79, 971\u2013979\nof ice shelves (Bar Dolev et al., 2016). This bacterium uses surface adhesins containing several sections of repetitive protein domains to afford both ice adhesion and biofilm formation at the ice\u2013water interface (Guo et al., 2017). Its giant 1.5 MDa adhesin is thought to mediate biofilm formation through \ufffd120 calcium-binding Ig-like repeat domains. Calcium binding produces a more rigid and tightly folded Iglike domain in much the same way as provided by the intramolecular ester and isopeptide cross-links. Given that persistent bacterial vaginosis has been linked to Mobiluncus species and biofilm formation (Jung et al., 2017), it is conceivable that Actinomyces bacteria promote biofilm formation through their super-sized adhesins. While this role remains to be linked to the adhesins from Mobiluncus and Varibaculum, this can now be investigated as an attractive working hypothesis."
