    "abstractText": "Seismic imaging is an ill-posed inverse problem that is challenged by noisy data and modeling inaccuracies\u2014due to errors in the background squared-slowness model. Uncertainty quantification is essential for determining how variability in the background models affects seismic imaging. Due to the costs associated with the forward Born modeling operator as well as the high dimensionality of seismic images, quantification of uncertainty is computationally expensive. As such, the main contribution of this work is a survey-specific Fourier neural operator surrogate to velocity continuation that maps seismic images associated with one background model to another virtually for free. While being trained with only 200 background and seismic image pairs, this surrogate is able to accurately predict seismic images associated with new background models, thus accelerating seismic imaging uncertainty quantification. We support our method with a realistic data example in which we quantify seismic imaging uncertainties using a Fourier neural operator surrogate, illustrating how variations in background models affect the position of reflectors in a seismic image.",

This linearized imaging problem is challenged by the computationally expensive forward operator as well as presence of measurements noise, linearization errors, modeling errors, and the nontrivial nullspace of the linearized forward Born modeling operator [1\u20133]. These challenges highlight the importance of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in seismic imaging, where instead of finding one seismic image estimate, a distribution of seismic images is obtained that explains the observed data [4], consequently reducing the risk of data overfit and enabling UQ [5\u201315].\nThe seismic imaging uncertainty can be attributed to two main sources [16\u201318]: (1) errors in the data, which include measurement and linearization errors; and (2) modeling errors, which include errors in the estimation of the background squared-slowness model. In this paper, we focus on uncertainties with respect to the background model as it has the main contributing factor to imaging uncertainty due to its effect on reflector positioning [18\u201320]. To this end, we assume there are no measurement or linearization errors and consider the map from shot records to the seismic image to be represented by the deterministic reverse-time migration (RTM) algorithm. In this setup, quantifying the uncertainty in seismic imaging\u2014due to errors in the background model\u2014involves computing numerous RTMs with all the background model posterior samples [8, 9]. Due to the high-dimensionality of seismic images, the number of seismic imaging posterior samples required to obtain accurate estimations of the imaging posterior moments is large, making UQ with respect to the background model computationally expensive for 2D and unfeasible for large 3D problems. These costs can be alleviated via velocity continuation methods [21\u201325] that map seismic images associated with one background model to another, without directly solving the imaging problem. Velocity continuation methods are ar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n14 38\n6v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. ge\noph\n] 2\n7 M\ndesigned to be frugal compared to computing a new RTM for each new background model, which makes them suitable for large-scale seismic imaging uncertainty quantification [19, 20].\nWhile several velocity continuation methods have been proposed [21\u201325], they typically involve solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which can be still costly in the context of seismic imaging UQ. To address this challenge, we propose a neural network surrogate for velocity continuation that is capable of mapping seismic images associated with one background model to another with negligible computational cost. Motivated by the success of Fourier neural operators [FNOs, 26] in approximating the solution operator of PDEs [27\u201329], we chose them as the architecture for our neural network surrogate. Due to our main interest in accelerating velocity continuation in the context of UQ, we train a survey-specific FNO that acts as a surrogate for velocity continuation for the specific survey at hand. This choice, while not offering generalizations across different survey areas in the Earth, can speed up seismic imaging UQ for the survey at hand, which involves computing seismic images associated with many background model posterior samples. We show that the FNO can be trained using 200 pairs of background and seismic image pairs, making the survey-specific training procedure computationally viable. To scale this method to industry size problems, transfer learning [30] can further reduce the upfront costs of training the FNO. After training, the FNO can be used to obtain samples from the imaging posterior almost free of cost.\nIn the next section, we describe seismic imaging by introducing the forward Born modeling operator, through which the seismic image relates to the background model. Next, we define velocity continuation, followed by describing our proposed FNO-based approach for accelerating seismic imaging UQ. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the trained neural operator on a realistic dataset, and we demonstrate how the imaging uncertainty affects the positioning of the reflectors in the seismic image."

This problem, also known as seismic imaging, can be formulated as a linear inverse problem by linearizing the nonlinear relationship between shot records and the squared-slowness model, governed by the wave-equation. In its simplest acoustic form, the linearization with respect to the slowness model\u2014around a background squared slowness model m0\u2014leads to a linear inverse problem for estimating the ground truth seismic image \u03b4m\u2217 with the following forward model,\n\u03b4di = J(m0,qi)\u03b4m\u2217. (1) In the above expression, \u03b4d = {\u03b4di}nsi=1 are ns linearized shot records and J(m0,qi) represents the linearized Born scattering operator. This operator is parameterized by the source signature qi and the background squared-slowness model m0, which is typically estimated in the previous inversion steps [8, 9]. In this work, we focus on potential inaccuracies in the background model, the main source of variability and uncertainty in seismic imaging [18\u201320]. Therefore, we assume there are not measurement and linearization errors, which leads to a deterministic mapping from {\u03b4di}nsi=1 to \u03b4m for a given background model. We use RTM for this deterministic map, which involves applying the adjoint linearized Born scattering operator to the linearized shot records for all source experiments,\n\u03b4mRTM = ns\u2211\ni=1 J(m0,qi)>\u03b4di. (2)\nSince this map is deterministic, the uncertainty in the background model can be translated into uncertainty in seismic imaging by evaluating Equation 2 for the background models sampled from the posterior distribution p(m0 | d), where d represents the shot records with no linearization (the field data) [8, 9]. Bayesian inference involving high-dimensional posterior distributions, for example seismic imaging and full-waveform inversion, requires many samples from the posterior distribution for accurate Monte Carlo approximation of high-dimensional integrals [31]. As a result, the mapping in Equation 2 must be evaluated over numerous background model samples from p(m0 | d), which\nis computationally expensive due to costs of applying J(m0,qi)>, i = 1, . . . , ns. To address this computational challenge, our proposed method involves a FNO-based velocity continuation approach that is capable of mapping seismic images associated with one background model to another, effectively replacing a costly demingration-migration. We describe this approach in the next section."

Using this technique, an initial seismic image associated with an initial background model minit is altered to approximate the seismic image associated with a target background model mtarget without computing Equation 2. This process can be interpreted as a map [23]: T(minit,mtarget) : \u03b4M\u2192 \u03b4M, (3) where \u03b4M denotes the space of seismic images, and the velocity continuation map is parameterized by minit and mtarget. We take advantage of recent advances in deep learning to train a surrogate model for velocity continuation that approximates T(minit,mtarget) = J(mtarget,qi)>(J(minit,qi)>)\u2020, which can be evaluated virtually for free instead of solving four PDEs. Through this approach, we are able to significantly accelerate velocity continuation, trading wave-equation solves for a simple neural network inference. This is of considerable importance in the context of seismic imaging UQ. Before demonstrating the benefits of our approach, we introduce FNOs in the context of velocity continuation."

            "text": "In light of their success in learning mesh-free solution operators to PDEs [27\u201329], we choose FNOs [26] as a surrogate model for velocity continuation\u2014a process that can be interpreted as a double linearized PDE solve. The main components of FNOs are the Fourier layers, which involve a Fourier transform over the spatial dimensions of their input, followed by a learned pointwise multiplication and an inverse Fourier transform. These layers act as long-kernel convolutional layer, akin to pseudospectral methods, which explains the representation power of FNOs [29]. To train a FNO as a surrogate model for velocity continuation, we define it as a map\nGw :M\u00d7 \u03b4M\u2192 \u03b4M, (4) where Gw denotes the FNO with weights w, andM is the space of background models. In words, we design Gw as a neural network that takes as input the target background model and the initial seismic image, and outputs the target seismic image. This choice is analogous to the structure of the velocity continuation map T(minit,mtarget) (cf. Equation 3), except that we fix the initial background model minit to an arbitrary background model posterior sample, hence making the dependence of Gw to minit implicit. With this choice of inputs and output for Gw, the FNO\u2019s task is to perturb the input initial seismic image according to the provided target background model in order to predict the target seismic image.\nDue to our interest in accelerating velocity continuation in the context of UQ, we train a surveyspecific FNO that acts as a surrogate for velocity continuation for the specific survey at hand. This choice, while not offering generalizations across different survey areas in the Earth, can speed up seismic imaging UQ for the survey at hand, which involves computing seismic images associated with many posterior background model samples m0 \u223c p(m0 | d). By training the FNO on a small number of these background model and seismic image pairs, i.e., approximately 200, we can accelerate the velocity continuation process for the rest of the background model posterior samples while limiting the risk of introducing generalization errors due to the strong heterogeneity of Earth. To achieve this, we construct a set of N training input-output pairs in the form of{((\nm(i)0 , \u03b4minit ) , \u03b4m(i)RTM ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 i = 1, . . . , N}, (5) where (m(i)0 , \u03b4minit) is the input target background and initial seismic image training pair, and \u03b4m (i) RTM is the associated target seismic image.

(6)\nWe solve optimization problem 6 with the Adam stochastic optimization algorithm [32]. After training, the trained FNO approximates the velocity continuation map for a fixed homogeneous initial background model, i.e.,\nGw\u2217(mtarget, \u03b4minit) \u2248 T(minit,mtarget)(\u03b4minit) = \u03b4mtarget, (7) where minit is fixed to an arbitrary background model posterior sample and \u03b4mtarget denotes the seismic image associated with \u03b4minit. Given background model samples m0 \u223c p(m0 | d) as input, the FNO outputs samples from the imaging posterior, p(m0 | \u03b4d). This process accelerates seismic imaging uncertainty quantification as no further RTMs (Equation 2) need to be computed. Training the FNO with as little as 200 training pairs makes the survey-specific training procedure computationally viable. To further accelerate the process, training of the FNO can be started as the same time as the background model posterior sampling phase, using the already collected posterior samples as training data. In the next section, we show the results of approximating the velocity continuation map with a FNO via a quasi-real seismic experiment."

Figures 1a and 1b show the vertical profile of five randomly selected background and seismic images at 2.50 km, respectively. These images, displaying strong amplitude and phase differences, highlight the importance of quantifying the uncertainty in imaging when dealing with errors in the background model.

This is conducted over the testing dataset, which is derived using the same procedure as the training dataset using the background model creating oracle. Figures 2b and 2c show the target and predicted seismic images, respectively, and Figures 2d includes the difference between them. We observe that the network has accurately predicted the target image, where errors are mostly due to amplitude differences. The accuracy of\nthe prediction in terms of phase and amplitude can be further confirmed by focusing on two vertical profiles, at 2.50 km (Figure 2e) and 4.125 km (Figure 2f) horizontal locations, which include regions with fault and torturous reflectors. We use the trained FNO for UQ by providing testing background models and predicting the associated seismic images. We visualize the obtained uncertainties by showing the variability in the location of reflectors, determined via an automatic horizon tracking software [35]. We pass the seismic images predicted by the FNO to the horizon tracker for 25 selected horizons. As a result, we obtain multiple instances of each horizons, from which we compute pointwise mean and standard deviations. Figure 3 indicates the result where the solid lines correspond to the mean among different instances of each horizons and shaded areas indicate the mean plus and minus the pointwise standard deviation. These shaded areas indicate uncertainties in the location of the reflectors, which are due to the variability in the background models. As expected, we find a general increase of uncertainty with depth. We also observe that the areas of high uncertainty are correlated with areas of poor illumination, faults and tortuous reflectors.\nIn this example, we use Devito [36, 37] for the wave-equation based simulations. We based our PyTorch FNO implementation on the original implementation. The code to reproduce our results are made available on GitHub."
