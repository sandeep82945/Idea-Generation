    "abstractText": "We describe the first results from the All-sky BRIght, Complete Quasar Survey (AllBRICQS), which aims to discover the last remaining optically bright quasars. We present 156 spectroscopically confirmed quasars (140 newly identified) having |b| > 10\u25e6. 152 of the quasars have Gaia DR3 magnitudes brighter than BP = 16.5 or RP = 16 mag, while four are slightly fainter. The quasars span a redshift range of z = 0.07 \u2013 3.93. In particular, we highlight the properties of J0529-4351 at z = 3.93, which, if unlensed, is one of the most intrinsically luminous quasars in the Universe. The AllBRICQS sources have been selected by combining data from the Gaia and WISE all-sky satellite missions, and we successfully identify quasars not flagged as candidates by Gaia Data Release 3. We expect the completeness to be \u2248 96% within our magnitude and latitude limits, while the preliminary results indicate a selection purity of \u2248 96%. The optical spectroscopy used for source classification will also enable detailed quasar characterisation, including black hole mass measurements and identification of foreground absorption systems. The AllBRICQS sources will greatly enhance the number of quasars available for high-signal-to-noise follow-up with present and future facilities.",

            "text": "Optically bright quasars represent an admixture of sources drawn from a continuum of properties \u2014 at one extreme: the rare, distant, rapidly growing black holes (BHs); and at the other: the more common, modestly growing BHs located closer to the Milky Way. Previous work has found the cumulative surface density of optically bright quasars to be well described by a power-law as a function of magnitude, such that the integrated number of quasars brighter than BJ =15.5 mag is 1 per 100 deg2, and increases by 1 dex for every 1.3 magnitudes of decreased optical flux (Wisotzki et al. 2000).\nCompared to the bulk of quasars at fainter optical magnitudes, the bright end of the distribution offers obvious advantages in terms of signal-to-noise for detailed follow-up. Such quasars are particularly useful as background sources for studies of intervening absorption from circumgalactic (Tumlinson et al. 2017) and intergalactic gas (McQuinn 2016).\nMoreover, because the physical size of the quasar broadline region (BLR) scales with luminosity as \u223c \u221a L (Bentz et al. 2013), and, to first order, the distance to the quasar scales as\u221a L/F for flux F, the angular size of the BLR scales as \u221a F. This means that the optically brightest quasars have the largest apparent BLRs, making them especially interesting targets for high spatial resolution investigation with instruments such as GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI; e.g., Gravity Collaboration et al. 2018, 2020, 2021b,a).\nApproximately 1% of spectroscopically confirmed active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs)a have Gaia Data Release 3 photometry (Gaia Collaboration 2016, 2021) brighter than BP = 16.5 or RP = 16 mag, and 89% of those bright objects have redshifts less than z = 0.1. The recent discovery of a remarkably bright quasar at z = 0.83 \u2014 SMSS J114447.77-430859.3 (hereafter, J1144-4308), with BP = 14.64 mag (Onken et al. 2022a) \u2014 motivates a renewed search for other bright quasars that have gone undetected.\nHere we describe the search criteria and first results from the All-sky BRIght, Complete Quasar Survey (AllBRICQS). In Section 2, we explain the AllBRICQS selection criteria. In Section 3, we describe the optical spectroscopy obtained for the first set of candidates. We present the spectroscopically confirmed AllBRICQS sample in Section 4 and report on our preliminary success rate. In Section 5, we examine the highestredshift AllBRICQS discovery, J0529-4351, in greater detail. Section 6 compares our confirmed quasars with the quasar catalogues derived from Gaia DR3. In Section 7, we discuss the present results and the outlook for the scientific exploitation of the completed survey.\nWe adopt a flat \u039bCDM cosmology, having a matter density of \u2126m = 0.3 and a Hubble-Lema\u00eetre constant of H0 = 70 km s\u20131 Mpc\u20131. Throughout the paper, we use Vega magnitudes unless otherwise specified.\naThese statistics are based on the Million Quasars Catalogue (Flesch 2021), version 7.6; hereafter, Milliquas.\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n09 34\n2v 3\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .G\nA ]\n1 7\nFe b"

            "text": "Finding bright quasars has been greatly simplified in modern times, first with the all-sky survey of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010; Mainzer et al. 2014), and more recently with the accurate parallax and proper motion information from the all-sky survey of Gaia. Several authors have proposed very effective methods for selecting quasar candidates exploiting these data sets using hard selection cuts, Bayesian probabilities, or machine-learning approaches (e.g. Calderone et al. 2019; Shu et al. 2019; Wolf et al. 2020). Here, we choose a very simple approach, given that we focus our interest at bright magnitudes, where the stars, galaxies, and quasars can be easily separated, as demonstrated below.\nWe avoid the vicinity of the Galactic Plane, where quasars are dimmed by dust extinction and are harder to identify reliably due to source crowding biasing the photometry, especially in the WISE catalogue, where the large point spread function in the infrared passbands leads to blending. Effective searches in the Galactic Plane include the work of Fu et al. (2022), who have recently discovered 191 new quasars, five of which are brighter than i = 16 ABmag. In contrast, we restrict our search to a Galactic latitude of |b| > 10\u25e6 and avoid the most difficult parts of the plane.\nPrevious work has shown that known quasars have Gaia parallaxes and proper motions (PPM) that are statistically consistent with zero within their errors (e.g., Liao et al. 2021; Onken et al. 2022b; Souchay et al. 2022, but for interesting counter-examples, see Wu et al. 2022) and hence we restrict the search to a target list with parallaxes and proper motions of low (< 4\u03c3) significance. We also restrict the search to objects with a Gaia BP/RP excess factor (phot_bp_rp_excess_factor; see Riello et al. 2021) < 1.5, which rejects clearly extended or blended sources. Among the known broad-line quasars in the Milliquas catalogue having Gaia BP < 17 mag, z > 0.3, and |b| > 10\u25e6, the selection rules above reject less than 4% of the quasars (43 out of 1,227); some of the rejected objects have no PPM measurements at all, however, the vast majority of the objects are simply consistent with being drawn from the tails of a zero-PPM population.\nWe investigated several colour properties, and found that the mid-infrared W1 \u2013 W2 colour provides a highly effective distinction between the known quasars and the bulk of the candidate sample, which are primarily distant (hence, small PPM) stars. In the left panel of Figure 1, we show the W1\u2013W2 colour vs. Gaia BP magnitude for the known quasars from Milliquas and the sample passing the Gaia criteria above. At BP < 17 mag, the quasar and non-quasar population appear clearly separated, while they start to blend into each other at fainter magnitudes. As the known quasars have been compiled from a variety of selection methods (X-ray, UV, optical, radio), the mid-infrared quasar colours should not be subject to any particular biases beyond the scatter arising from the photometric errors, and just reflect the typical spectral energy distribution (SED) associated with accretion onto a BH. Thus, we select quasar candidates using the simple rule of W1 \u2013 W2 > 0.2 mag. While there is likely to be increasing contamination towards that W1 \u2013 W2\nboundary, the moderate number of candidates to follow up allows us to pursue a strategy that emphasises completeness (and the threshold may be relaxed further in future expansions of the observing campaign). Based on the PPM statistics above, expect the completeness to be \u2248 96% for |b| > 10\u25e6.\nAs shown in the middle panel of Figure 1, the quasars that approach our W1 \u2013 W2 threshold at faint BP magnitudes are strongly biased towards high redshift, but some sources at z \u223c 4 can still be found within our selected region.\nWe limit the present sample to have either BP < 16.5 or RP < 16 mag and find 290 candidatesb (see right panel of Figure 1). Approximately 500 broad-line quasars are known at z > 0.3 within these magnitude limits. If \u223c 85% of our candidates were similar objects, then one third of bright quasars would be missing from current catalogues and be revealed by AllBRICQS.\nIn Fig. 2 we characterise our candidate list further in relation to known quasars of similar brightness. We can see that our new candidates are more numerous at Southern declinations and especially at Southern Galactic latitudes. The reason is, of course, that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al. 2000; Richards et al. 2002; Abdurro\u2019uf & et al. 2022), which has revealed a huge sample of quasars, was focused on the Northern Galactic Cap."

WiFeS is an integral field spectrograph and, with a spatial binning of 2 pixels, provides 1x1\u2032\u2032sampling over a 25x38\u2032\u2032field-of-view.\nWiFeS spectra were obtained between UT 2022-03-11 and 2022-11-24 for the AllBRICQS sample presented here. We note that observations on one of those nights (UT 2022-06-14) were conducted as part of the Science Verification activities for the fully robotic operations of the ANU 2.3m telescope. The targets were selected from the candidate list based purely on considerations of observability (Right Ascension and airmass), aiming for complete coverage of the list (between RA=10h and 5h, only five candidates still needed observing).\nWith the resolving power R \u223c 3000 gratings and the RT560 beamsplitter, we used exposure times between 180 and 1500 s, covering the wavelength range 3250\u20139550 \u00c5 across the two cameras of the spectrograph. Various spectrophotometric standard stars were observed alongside the AllBRICQS candidates and were used for calibrating the overall spectral shape. However, because the standards were not necessarily observed under the same observing conditions, we do not utilise them for absolute flux calibration.\nThe raw data were processed with the PYTHON-based pipeline, PyWiFeS (Childress et al. 2014). We then extracted the spectra from the 3D data cubes (separate cubes for each\nbAn early version of the sample definition extended the depth a further 0.5 magnitudes, and we present four quasars discovered from that sample in Tables A.1 and A.4, as well as the spectrum gallery in Appendix 2.\narm of the spectrograph) using QFITSVIEWc, utilising nearby regions for sky subtraction. The signal-to-noise values in the final spectra were typically between 10 and 50 per pixel.\nThe spectra were classified and redshifted by eye, aided by the MARZ online applicationd (Hinton et al. 2016; Hinton 2016). The typical redshift uncertainty is 0.01, but can be either better or worse depending on the details of the available emission lines and their shapes."

(2019) extinction curve implemented in the dust_extinction PYTHON package (Gordon 2021). We assume RV = 3.1, and apply a \u00d70.86 correction factor to the values drawn from the Schlegel et al. (1998) E(B \u2013 V) map (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). We\nderive continuum luminosities from the observed redshifts and the median extinction-corrected emission in 20 \u00c5 windows centred around the rest-frame wavelengths of 1450, 3000, and 5100 \u00c5 (as the redshifts permit, and excluding the 1450 \u00c5 continuum for broad absorption line quasars). We also estimate the bolometric luminosity for each quasar by applying the bolometric corrections (BCs) from Runnoe et al. (2012b,a) and adopting the mean when multiple values are available. The continuum and bolometric luminosities are provided in Appendix 5. Based on the typical RMS fluxes within the spectroscopic continuum windows, we expect the luminosity estimates to be reliable at the level of 0.1 dex, but plan to make more precise measurements when performing detailed spectral fitting in future work.\nThe bolometric luminosities across redshift are shown in comparison to the quasars from the 14th data release of SDSS (DR14Q; Rakshit et al. 2020) in Figure 3. To adopt a consistent bolometric correction as above, we apply the Runnoe et al. (2012b,a) BCs to the tabulated DR14Q continuum luminosities and again take the mean value when multiple estimates are available. We also show in Figure 3 a number of bright quasars for comparison with the AllBRICQS sample: the long-studied 3C 273; the most luminous known quasar in the Universe, SMSS J215728.21-360215.1 (hereafter, J21573602; Wolf et al. 2018a; Onken et al. 2020); and the bright quasar which inspired the AllBRICQS project, J1144-4308 (Onken et al. 2022a). The AllBRICQS quasars fill a niche not well populated by the DR14Q sample, despite substantial overlap between the SDSS bright-end limit of iSDSS = 15 ABmag and the AllBRICQS faint-end limit of RP = 16 mag (iSDSS \u2248 16.35 ABmag).\nFor the extended AllBRICQS sample (having Gaia magnitudes just fainter than our main sample\u2019s criteria of BP < 16.5 mag or RP < 16 mag), we find one quasar, J1501-1053 at z = 0.72, with a luminosity that places it amongst the bulk of the AllBRICQS population (5.5\u00d7 1046 erg s\u20131). This quasar is relatively blue (BP \u2013 RP=0.59 mag), yet is in the 74th percentile of reddening amongst our confirmed quasars, with an E(B \u2013 V)SFD=0.12 mag. The extinction-corrected continuum luminosities at both 3000 \u00c5 and 5100 \u00c5 provide a consistent estimate of the bolometric luminosity, indicating that it was the foreground dust that caused the source to be marginally outside our selection criteria."

            "text": "One mechanism for producing high apparent luminosities is gravitational lensing, but we do not find evidence that the AllBRICQS sample is significantly affected by such magnifications. Here, we describe the general findings for the AllBRICQS sample, with particular discussion of the z = 3.93 quasar, J0529-4351, deferred to Section 5.\nFirst, we have visually inspected the optical images available from the SkyMapper Southern Surveye (Wolf et al. 2018b;\neSee https://skymapper.anu.edu.au.\nOnken et al. 2019), the Pan-STARRS1 Surveyf (Chambers et al. 2016; Waters et al. 2020), and the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) archiveg (Flaugher et al. 2015; Valdes et al. 2014), and find no indications of small-separation point sources that would be consistent with being multiple, lensed images of the quasar (although the low-redshift quasars often have visible host galaxies, including three \u2014 J0400-2257, J1619-7832, and J2126-4529 \u2014 which appear to be hosted by one component of a major galaxy merger).\nFurthermore, we have examined the properties of the AllBRICQS quasars in the catalogues of the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey (DELVE) DR2 (Drlica-Wagner et al. 2022) and the NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC) DR2 (Nidever et al. 2021). In neither catalogue do we find any AllBRICQS sources at z > 0.5 with significant evidence of being spatially extended.\nTaking advantage of the spatial resolution of Gaia, we also computed the C\u2217 statistic of Riello et al. (2021), which corrects the phot_bp_rp_excess_factor for colour-based trends. The C\u2217 values compare the fluxes in the wide-aperture spectroscopic windows (BP and RP) with the narrow-aperture astrometric window (G-band), and are constructed to be 0 for point sources. Comparing the C\u2217 values with their expected (G-magnitude-based) uncertainties, we find the vast majority of high C\u2217/\u03c3 quasars are the low redshift quasars in which the host galaxy is expected to contribute significant flux. At z > 0.5, only 9% (9 of 96 quasars) have C\u2217/\u03c3 > 2, and 2% (2 quasars: J0117-1712 at z = 0.68, and J0530+0042 at z = 0.7) have C\u2217/\u03c3 > 3. For the > 3\u03c3 quasars, the former has deep imaging by the Dark Energy Survey (Abbott et al. 2021) that shows a source 1.5\u2032\u2032 away. However, the Gaia DR3 astrometry for this G = 19.71 mag neighbour reveals it to be a foreground star. Meanwhile, J0530+0042 has DECam imaging (NOIRLab Prop. ID 2014B-0193; PI: F. Walter), which shows a faint source (\u223c 20.5 ABmag in i\u2013 and z-band), 3.5\u2032\u2032 to the Northeast, which is not catalogued by Gaia DR3, DELVE DR2, or NSC DR2. As this neighbour is beyond the 3.5-arcsec-wide BP/RP aperture, the relation to the high C\u2217 value is unclear, but we conclude that there is no convincing evidence for a foreground lens.\nThe lack of multiply imaged quasars is likely a consequence of our selection criteria. Requiring phot_bp_rp_excess_factor < 1.5 would eliminate\u223c 65% of the known gravitational lenses from either the Gravitationally Lensed Quasar Databaseh (see Lemon et al. 2019) or from a recent compilation of lensed, binary, and projected quasar pairs (Lemon et al. 2022). Additional lensing systems are likely to be lost from the AllBRICQS candidate list by violation of our W1 \u2013 W2 criterion through the mid-IR contributions from the lensing galaxy.\nThus, we find that the AllBRICQS quasars presented here are intrinsically luminous sources, drawn from the bright end of the quasar luminosity function.\nfSee https://ps1images.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/ps1cutouts. gSee https://datalab.noirlab.edu/sia.php. hSee https://research.ast.cam.ac.uk/lensedquasars/."

            "text": "In this section, we focus on the properties of the z = 3.93 quasar, J0529-4351. As indicated in Figure 3, the continuum flux at rest-frame 1450 \u00c5 suggests an intrinsic bolometric luminosity of 1.5\u00d7 1048 erg s\u20131, on par with the most luminous known quasar, J2157-3602 (Wolf et al. 2018a; Onken et al. 2020). In the observed frame, aside from two gravitationally lensed systems (APM 08279+5255 and B 1422+231), J0529-4351 has the brightest Gaia RP magnitude of any quasar more distant than HS 1946+7658 at z = 3.051. Hence, we examine in detail the available imaging data to constrain the possibility of gravitational lensing boosting the observed flux.\nAs discussed in Section 4.2, the relative flux measured by Gaia through its narrow (G-band) and wide (BP and RP) apertures can be used as a measure of extended emission on subarcsecond spatial scales. For J0529-4351, the colour-corrected phot_bp_rp_excess_factor, C\u2217, is found to be -0.037. With the 1\u03c3 scatter expected to be 0.02 at G = 16.34 mag (Riello et al. 2021), the Gaia data do not indicate any additional flux at radii larger than 0.175\u2032\u2032from the quasar (half the 0.35\u2032\u2032aperture of the G-band).\nIn addition, the Dark Energy Survey (DES) DR2 (Abbott et al. 2021) photometry for J0529-4351 is found to be consistent with a point source in all five optical/infrared bands (grizY): the SPREAD_MODEL and WAVG_SPREAD_MODEL are below 0.001 (where values below 0.003 have been found to robustly isolate stellar sources in griz imaging of similar depth; Desai et al. 2012), and the CLASS_STAR estimates are > 0.98.\nTo assess possible microlensing of J0529-4351 from stars in a putative foreground galaxy, we examined the photometry from several surveys of the past decade. SMSS DR3 opti-\ncal photometryi indicates a dimming of \u223c 0.2 mag between November 2014 and October 2019 in griz (the source is undetected in the u and v filters because of the Ly\u03b1 absorption). Similarly, the photometry from the NEOWISE 2022 Data Releasej (Mainzer et al. 2014) in W1 and W2, obtained between March 2014 and September 2021, indicates no more than 0.05 mag of dimming over that time span.\nIn terms of large-separation lensed images, the only other Gaia DR3 source in a 30\u2032 search radius having similar colours, low PPM, and an RP within 2 magnitudes of J0529-4351 is shown by DES imaging to be the centre of a foreground spiral galaxy.\nWe find that the existing data for J0529-4351 provides no evidence that the quasar is gravitationally lensed, and thus, we conclude that its extraordinary luminosity is likely to be an indication of an extremely high accretion rate onto its BH.\nIn terms of its multi-wavelength properties, we find no radio detections within 2\u2032 in DR1 of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS; McConnell et al. 2020; Hale et al. 2021), and no X-ray counterparts catalogued within 25\u2032 in the Second ROSAT all-sky X-ray Survey (2RXS; Boller et al. 2016).\nGiven the unusual nature of J0529-4351, we have already begun to collect additional data to further investigate this remarkable quasar.\n6. Comparison with Gaia-selected quasars We compare our confirmed quasars with the quasar catalogues derived from the Gaia variability analysis (Carnerero et al.\niSMSS DR3 is currently available to Australian astronomers, but the upcoming SMSS DR4 will be rapidly made available to astronomers worldwide.\njSee https://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/neowise/.\n2022), or from other Gaia source classification methods (Gaia Collaboration 2022; Delchambre et al. 2022), including those utilising the BP/RP low-resolution spectra (De Angeli et al. 2022; Montegriffo et al. 2022).\nFirst, we consider the Gaia DR3 variabLE AgN sample (GLEAN; Carnerero et al. 2022). The GLEAN coverage excludes the Galactic Plane and regions around the Magellanic Clouds because of its constraint on the number density of sources within 100 arcsec being less than 0.004 arcsec\u20132. This irregular exclusion zone covers |b| . 25\u25e6 at the Galactic Centre, but allows sparse sampling of the Plane in the direction of the Anti-centre. The GLEAN samplek totals over 872,000 sources, including more than 21,000 potentially new quasars. The latter are predominantly at GP > 20 mag, significantly fainter than the AllBRICQS regime (GP . 17 mag).\nWe indicate in Table A.1 whether each AllBRICQS quasar was included in the GLEAN sample, or in another Gaia DR3 variability tablel, or neither. The completeness of the GLEAN sample is estimated (cf. Fig. 24 of Carnerero et al. 2022) to be > 80% for GP < 17 mag, with a purity of > 95%. Having 123 of our 156 quasars selected by GLEAN, and one GLEANselected star compared to the 123 quasars, the first AllBRICQS sample is consistent with the Carnerero et al. (2022) estimates.\nWe further compare the AllBRICQS quasars to the classifications produced by Gaia\u2019s Discrete Source Classifier (DSC; Gaia Collaboration 2022; Delchambre et al. 2022), a probabilistic classification algorithm that was trained on 300,000 SDSS quasars. The DSC assigned a quasar label (via the Combmod classifier, recorded in the classlabel_dsc parameter) to 116 of our 156 quasars, or 74% completeness within the present sample. This appears to be significantly lower than the expectedm quasar completeness for GP < 17 mag of nearly 100%. We find that 37 of the AllBRICQS quasars were labelled as stars (including one as a \"physicalbinary\"), as was just 1 of the 6 stars we observed. Of particular note, J0529-4351, the luminous quasar at z = 3.93, was labelled as a star by the DSC with 99.98% probability.\nIn addition to the 116 quasars identified by the DSC, another 10 were flagged as quasars by the Outlier Analysis (OA) module, which uses self-organising maps (Kohonen 1982) to label sources with low DSC classification probability.\nThe challenges inherent in classifying quasars from Gaia\u2019s low-resolution BP/RP spectroscopy are evident when comparing against our R \u223c 3000 spectra from WiFeS (Figure 4). The blending of nearby emission lines, which can exhibit an intrinsic dispersion in relative fluxes, shifts the peak of the line emission, and the \"ringing\" in the spectra reconstructed from the DR3 basis functions, both at the blue end and in regions around strong emission lines, often makes an assessment of the true underlying spectrum difficult. In terms of further analysis\nkSee https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR3/Data_analysis/ chap_cu7var/sec_cu7var_agn/.\nlSee https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR3/Data_analysis/ chap_cu7var/sec_cu7var_intro/ssec_cu7var_dataproducts.html.\nmSee Fig. 11.13 from https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/ GDR3/Data_analysis/chap_cu8par/sec_cu8par_apsis/ssec_cu8par_apsis_dsc. html.\nof the spectra, studies of absorption features (both broad and narrow) and emission line widths (e.g., for BH mass estimation) are only possible with higher resolving power than provided by the BP/RP spectra.\n6.1 Gaia-based redshi estimates Finally, we consider the performance of Gaia\u2019s quasar classifier (QSOC; Delchambre et al. 2022) on the AllBRICQS objects. QSOC further analyses the DSC-labelled quasars (including those with quasar probabilities as low as 1%) to estimate redshifts from the BP/RP spectra. The method, trained on SDSS quasars, produced redshifts for 130 of the AllBRICQS quasars, including 96 quasars for which flags_qsoc = 0 (indicating reliable estimates). Among the latter, we find there to be one outlier, J2059-1632, a z = 0.8 quasar for which QSOC estimated z = 3.146682 \u00b1 0.0089 (mistaking Mg II for Ly\u03b1). Amongst the remaining 95 quasars, the QSOC redshift estimate is 0.001 too low in the mean, with a root-mean-square variation of less than 0.005. With a typical QSOC redshift uncertainty of 0.001, the differences are likely dominated by the limited redshift precision to which AllBRICQS aspires, and thus we confirm that QSOC is a highly effective tool for estimating quasar redshifts."

            "text": "The sources discovered in AllBRICQS are those which have eluded detection in the first 50+ years of quasar searches, but many had already come under suspicion from other selection methods. In Section 6, we described the high degree of completeness for the Gaia quasar classification, which is remarkable given their exclusive reliance on Gaia\u2019s optical dataset (astrometric, photometric, and low-resolution spectroscopic). Yet the existence of AllBRICQS quasars that escaped the Gaia criteria confirms the value of multi-wavelength approaches.\nIn addition to the Gaia variability and spectroscopic classifications, Table A.1 indicates the objects which were flagged as Primary or Secondary quasar candidates from the Ultraviolet Quasar Survey (UVQS; Monroe et al. 2016), which combined photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX; Martin et al. 2005) and WISE satellites. Apart from Galactic extinction, these UV/optical probes should provide the most complete samples of unobscured quasars at low to moderate redshift.\nAt higher energies, we anticipate the majority of the real quasars amongst the AllBRICQS candidates to be detected by SRG/eROSITA (the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma satellite\u2019s extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array; Predehl et al. 2021). In addition, a small number of AllBRICQS quasars are also known to be associated with quasar-like radio emission, but did not have a spectroscopically confirmed redshift.\nOutliers from the AllBRICQS selection criteria (in either Gaia astrometry or WISE colours) could still be identified at other wavelengths, and many of those bright quasars may be\nobserved as part of the Black Hole Mappern (BHM) within SDSS-V (Kollmeier et al. 2017). Moreover, the BHM program will greatly expand the samples at fainter optical magnitudes, particularly as SDSS extends its optical spectroscopy footprint to the Southern hemisphere.\nEarly large-area surveys for blue objects were limited to high Galactic latitude, with the Cal\u00e1n-Tololo Survey (Maza et al. 1988, 1996) and Hamburg Quasar Survey (Hagen et al. 1995, 1999) extending closest to the Galactic Plane (|b| > 20\u25e6) in the Southern and Northern hemispheres, respectively. Even DR1 of the UVQS, which focused on FUV-detected sources from GALEX, was incomplete in its coverage near the Plane because of the failure of the FUV detector prior to the relaxing of the satellite\u2019s initial safety constraints on overall count rates (see Bianchi 2014).\nAllBRICQS is covering the sky down to |b| > 10\u25e6, but is still constrained from fully exploring behind the Galactic Plane because of source confusion arising from the limited spatial resolution of WISE (\u223c 6 arcsec in W1 and W2). Dedicated quasar searches within the Galactic Plane require alternative selection criteria to mitigate the effects of dust extinction, but have begun yielding significant samples (Im et al. 2007; Fu et al. 2021, 2022). Beyond photometric searches, additional low-latitude quasars may be uncovered thanks to the nearIR resolving power of the forthcoming SPHEREx satellite\u2019s\nnSee https://www.sdss5.org/mappers/black-hole-mapper/.\nall-sky spectrophotometric surveyo (Crill et al. 2020). AllBRICQS will complete observations of the target sample at declination \u03b4 < +20\u25e6 with the ANU 2.3m telescope at SSO. The intention for the Northern targets is to collect spectra at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO) 1.8-meter telescope and the Seoul National University Astronomical Observatory (SAO) 1.0-meter telescope in South Korea, and the Yunnan Observatories (YNAO) Lijiang 2.4-meter telescope at the Gaomeigu site near Lijiang, China. These observations will confirm classifications and determine redshifts, as well as enabling virial estimates of BH masses (see Cackett et al. 2021, and references therein). They will also reveal unusual optical spectral properties and foreground absorbers, which may flag specific targets for detailed follow-up at other facilities.\nIn particular, the two bright quasars at z > 2.5 \u2014 J04310838 at z = 2.53 with SMSS DR3 i = 16.42 ABmag, and J0529-4351 at z = 3.93 with i = 16.07 ABmag \u2014 may be appealing targets for the Sandage Test (Sandage 1962). With high-stability wavelength calibration and extremely large telescopes, it should soon be possible to directly detect the expansion of the Universe through the wavelength drift of intervening absorbers over time baselines of decades (Liske et al. 2008). These two AllBRICQS quasars, and subsequent discoveries at similar redshifts, would supplement the samples recently compiled by QUBRICS (QUasars as BRIght beacons for Cos-\noSee https://spherex.caltech.edu.\nmology in the Southern Hemisphere; Calderone et al. 2019; Boutsia et al. 2020) and ELQS (Extremely Luminous Quasar Survey; Schindler et al. 2017, 2019).\nFinally, we note that a few AllBRICQS quasars were catalogued as AGNs by the Edinburgh-Cape (EC) Blue Object Survey, but because of the EC Survey\u2019s focus on hot, evolved stars in the Milky Way, the quasar spectra were not presented and no redshifts were recorded. We expect that many of the AllBRICQS candidates have been observed by groups looking for objects other than quasars, who seemingly had little incentive to publish those spectra \u2014 a situation which nearly held true for the case of J1144-4308 (Onken et al. 2022a). Yet even if AllBRICQS presents spectra of those objects in future papers, the historical datasets could hold enormous value for studies of variability properties and searches for changing-look AGNs (e.g., LaMassa et al. 2015), and we encourage readers to dust off their old datasets and publish their quasar spectra."
