I\u00a0have to do an evaluation to determine what is causing that stress. It could be just underneath the surface, and I\u00a0have difficulty putting into words what is causing the stress. Often the best way to find what is stressing me out, what it is just underneath the surface, is talking to a close friend, family member, or doctor. I\u00a0am constantly reminded; I\u00a0cannot do this alone. I\u00a0need support to get through these anxious\u00a0times.\nRecently, I\u00a0 have a major life even coming up in my life. I\u00a0 am moving to South Carolina to be close to my family. I\u00a0will be living close to the beach in an area with which I\u00a0am familiar. I\u00a0will be closer to my parents who are an important part of my support team. I\u00a0thought I\u00a0was managing the move well. I\u00a0am usually in the mindset that I\u00a0will deal with the situation when I\u00a0come to it; however, I\u00a0 realized that the thoughts of this big step had me in knots that were just below the surface of my\u00a0life.\nMy new apartment will be in a neighborhood of grocery stores, restaurants, and a movie theater. A\u00a0 nice hot meal will be blocks away. My new location will be very convenient to all the places I\u00a0 need, including the Veteran\u2019s Hospital which is only a block away from my new apartment.\nIn the weeks leading up to this move, I\u00a0 realized that I\u00a0had fallen into the hole known as depression. I\u00a0tried distracting myself with music, movies, and exercise. I\u00a0 was awakened by demonic voices which freaked me out even though I\u00a0knew that could be a part of my schizophrenia. I\u00a0managed to go back to sleep yet I\u00a0woke up again hours later. Trying to distract myself from the paranoia, I\u00a0 listened to my book on tape and made coffee. I\u00a0also listened to a church service\u00a0online.\nThe last thing I\u00a0wanted to do was to sit in a dark apartment, with the shades drawn doing my best to deal with these delusions, so I\u00a0went to breakfast not knowing what was causing my stress, and not understanding why I\u00a0was\nexperiencing symptoms of schizophrenia. What was the trigger? How could it be stress when I\u00a0am eating breakfast at my favorite place, and I\u00a0was moving into the perfect new apartment in a city that I\u00a0loved?\nIn the restaurant, I\u00a0heard insulting voices coming from my brain. I\u00a0 pretended to people watch, but not really. Instead, I\u00a0was trying to figure out if the voices were real or in my head. The server was polite, each of the other customers were at the table talking to friends or loved ones. I\u00a0 ate my breakfast, paid, and decided to get my car\u00a0washed.\nDuring my drive to the carwash, I\u00a0 was paranoid that I\u00a0was being followed. I\u00a0 ignored the feeling the best I\u00a0could, thinking that I\u00a0was not doing anything wrong or illegal. That is another thing I\u00a0 learned about my schizophrenia. Be good, behave appropriately, and you will have no reason to be paranoid.\nWhen I\u00a0was in the carwash the steering wheel seemed to be rocking back and forth, left, and right. I\u00a0did not know if the motion was really happening, or just in my head. I\u00a0started vacuuming my car thinking that the other customers were staring at me because I\u00a0was doing something weird. Because this has happened before, I\u00a0knew it was a part of my schizophrenia.\nI went back to my apartment and decided to call my parents. I\u00a0 left a voice mail, and then dad immediately called me back. I\u00a0do not care how capable I\u00a0am; I\u00a0cannot figure out my symptoms alone. Eventually, I\u00a0need to explain them to someone who can help me clarify what is going on. I\u00a0told dad about my schizophrenia symptoms, especially the demonic voices which was a first-time occurrence.\nDad and I\u00a0 kept talking. He asked me questions that helped him to understand what I\u00a0was going through. I\u00a0did my best to answer. During the 40-minute conversation, something clicked \u2026 I\u00a0realized there were still aspects of the move that were unfamiliar, creating an uncertainty I\u00a0had not\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /schizophreniabulletin/article/50/1/9/6523732 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\n10\nJ. A.\u00a0Jepson\nexperienced before. I\u00a0was reminded that I\u00a0do not have the power to predict the future. My new apartment was in the perfect place, but all the questions were causing me to be stressed out. Will the new VA have my medication? Will I\u00a0be able to drive short distances when I\u00a0am there? Would my new doctor and I\u00a0be able to communicate effectively? These questions, and others, were the origin of the stress I\u00a0 was feeling. The stress was creating the delusions and demonic voices. Just pinpointing the trigger made me feel so much better. Everyone can be affected by stress, even those who do not have a mental health diagnosis, and a major move can be a life-changing event for anyone. Dad and I\u00a0prayed together, and then I\u00a0went away from the conversation feeling much better. I\u00a0knew I\u00a0was not alone in making the move, and I\u00a0would have help along the way whenever I\u00a0had a question. I\u00a0felt like I\u00a0could manage the rest of the\u00a0day.\nI will begin a new routine when I\u00a0 get to my new location. My present life of doing my part in taking care\nof my mental health had become so easy. I\u00a0was familiar with my current Veteran\u2019s Hospital and its setup. I\u00a0had gone there since 2006, and I\u00a0 often found myself giving directions to someone who was new there. With the move, I\u00a0will be the new one again. I\u00a0will have to ask for directions, and there would be new procedures to learn. I\u00a0look forward to the time when I\u00a0will be in my new apartment with all my questions answered, but I\u00a0know that experiencing uncertainty is something we all go through whether or not we have a mental illness. This is another of the times when I\u00a0 am so glad, I\u00a0 have an excellent support team to help me. Through this experience of moving, I\u00a0am learning that stress is not necessarily caused by terrible things happening in my life. The stress that triggers my schizoaffective symptoms can come even when I\u00a0am looking forward to something new. Sometimes the schizophrenic challenge for me is day to day, hour to hour, or even minute to\u00a0minute.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /schizophreniabulletin/article/50/1/9/6523732 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024"
