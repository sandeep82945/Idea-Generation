    "abstractText": "A capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducer (CMUT) was engineered and functionalized with zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) dispersed in a photoresist AZ1512HS (AZ) matrix to function as a gravimetric gas sensor. The sensor response was recorded in the presence of nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, and methane gases as well as water, acetylene, a propane/butane mixture, n-hexane, gasoline, and diesel vapors. The photoresist matrix alone was found to have a negligible response to all the gases and vapors, except for water vapor. No visible difference in sensor response was detected when switching from nitrogen to methane gas. However, a strong shift in the sensor resonance frequency was observed when exposed to higher hydrocarbons, ranging from 1 kHz for acetylene to 7.5 kHz for gasoline. Even longer-chain hydrocarbons, specifically kerosene and more so diesel, had a significantly reduced sensor frequency shift compared with gasoline. Sensors functionalized with a thin film of AZ+ZIF-8 demonstrated higher sensitivity in their response to a hydrocarbon molecular mass than without functionalization.",

            "text": "Methane (CH4) and higher hydrocarbons are the main sources of heat, propulsion, and industrial energy. Naturally extracted hydrocarbons can have various impurities, such as carbon dioxide, and various reduced-sulfur compounds, some of which can be carcinogenic and toxic, while others can lower the energy density of the fuel or impede the transport logistics [1\u20135]. Furthermore, hydrocarbon fractionation is required for specific applications, such as in jet fuel, for optimal burning conditions and due to stringent environmental requirements [6]. Additionally, methane and higher hydrocarbons pose explosion and flammability hazards in natural gas or petroleum extraction and refinement as well as mining industries. Therefore, suitable testing and monitoring platforms for fuel composition and cleanliness are necessary. Typically, gas sensors have a few types of operation. Popular non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors have poor cross-selectivity due to their closely spaced mid-IR absorption footprints between 5 nm and 8 nm [7]. NDIRs can be improved by incorporating microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) or micro-optical systems that lead to better selectivity and the ability to detect multiple gases, but they are a more complex and expensive option. Examples of such systems are cavity ringdown spectroscopy [8], tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy [9], and NDIRs with tunable band-pass filters [10,11]. A strategy of integrating several NDIRs with fixed optical filters for selective multiple gas\nSensors 2023, 23, 8827. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23218827 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 8827 2 of 19\ndetection is impractical due to the requirement of an individual optical element for each measurement channel. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and other commonplace laboratory-based techniques are too bulky and too expensive to be portable, mass-produced, and ubiquitous solutions. A polymer-coated Bragg grating sensor was recently demonstrated for simultaneous CO2 and water vapor detection; however, the CO2 time resolution was lacking [12]. Some metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are excellent microporous adsorbents due to their ultrahigh specific surface and selective pore size. This allows their use for the adsorption of specific gases for storage purposes or filtration through MOF\u2013compound membranes [13,14]. Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), a zeolitic MOF, has been widely researched as the basis of such gas adsorbing and separation platforms [15,16]. It has been demonstrated to be a suitable material for nitrogen (N2)/CH4, propylene/propane, ethene/ethane, and other gas mixture separations [17\u201321]. With specific ZIF-8 modifications, its suitability for selective gas adsorption and permeability can be tailored [17,22]. ZIF-8 has already proven itself to be a flexible material for the differentiation, adsorption, and filtration of various gases. It has also shown potential as a material for the construction of sensing devices. Some gas sensors based on ZIF-8, such as the CH4 optical fiber-based sensor, have already been demonstrated [23], including as a chemo-resistive sensor [24]. This paper aimed to demonstrate the feasibility, characteristics, and versatility of a gravimetric MEMS capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducer (CMUT)-based ZIF-8-modified gas sensor. Successful gravimetric CMUT devices have been demonstrated before [25\u201328]. CMUTs are popular as a mass-sensing platform due to their sensitivity, ease of manufacture, scaling, and electronic response. In this paper, the authors micromachined and tested CMUT-based ZIF-8-functionalized sensor sensitivity to various gases with emphasis on functionality when switching between gases. CMUT technology offers several advantages over other gravimetric transducers, such as fabrication flexibility, integration potential, higher mass sensitivity, and a higher signalto-noise ratio [29,30]. The microscale fabrication technique allows for an extremely small footprint, unlocking its use in size-constrained applications. Excellent mass sensitivity and resolution can be achieved because CMUT structures have small membranes and can be designed for highly resonant frequencies and quality factors. Furthermore, CMUT arrays can be densely packed with individual elements, leading to reduced cross-talk between adjacent transducer elements. Integrating the elements into large arrays leads to a better SNR. The fabrication versatility of CMUTs can be included as another advantage as semiconductor fabrication techniques can be used, which offer precise control over the element size and geometry. This allows for customized transducer designs and integration with electronics on the same chip. Despite these advantages, CMUTs also have some limitations, including their complexity in fabrication and the potential for higher costs compared with traditional transducers. However, ongoing research and development efforts aim to address these challenges and further enhance the performance and affordability of CMUT technology."

AZ was used as a carrier matrix to suspend and hold the ZIF-8 particles. Even though the data showed that AZ alone did interact with some of the gases, the interaction was on a lower order-of-magnitude scale than the AZ+ZIF-8 devices. This interaction might not even have been of chemical nature, with a trivial flow rate and pressure variations being compelling explanations. Therefore, we concluded that ZIF-8 dominated gas absorption, retention, and release, as described multiple times in previous research. To decrease any unnecessary mass loading on CMUT membranes, initial CMUT sensors were drop-coated with methanol-suspended ZIF-8 (no AZ present). After drying out the methanol, these ZIF-8-only sensors were found to be unstable. The device resonance frequency and resonance amplitude markedly changed in minutes; optically, the observed ZIF-8 crystal structures on the surface reverted to an amorphous state, as it was before the methanol was fully dried out. Therefore, the AZ photoresist polymer was selected as an embedding matrix for ZIF-8 due to its solubility in methanol and compatibility with gold and silicon surfaces. Additionally, AZ+ZIF-8 exhibited a moderate level of agglomeration whilst methanol evaporated after AZ+ZIF-8 was drop-coated onto the sensor surface, as visible in Figure 2d.

Any sensor functionalization with freshly prepared, 1-day-old (kept in methanol), 1-week-old, and 1-month-old ZIF-8 showed similar responses and trends to all the gases. Supplementary Figure S5 demonstrates the repeatability of experiments after 1 week using the same sensors with selected gases. Therefore, any discrepancies in the results could be accounted for by the uneven thickness and distribution of the functional layer, produced by drop-coating the sensor surface (this was especially relevant for the gas sensitivity dependence on the layer thickness measurements with regards to the sample with the 1:8 AZ+ZIF-8 concentration as this seemed to underperform when compared with other samples). Similarly, the sensors that were functionalized with AZ+ZIF-8, used, and put aside for a week or a month exhibited the same behavior for any gases tested, with no deterioration in performance. The control sensor functionalized with only the AZ photoresist demonstrated minimal sensitivity only to water vapor and CO2, which could easily be compensated for when constructing a commercial sensor using various known techniques. Curiously, the opposite response of AZ+ZIF-8 to humidity-saturated N2 compared with the AZ sensor might indicate that humidity compensation might not be needed in some cases. An AZ-modified sensor; a graphene-oxide-modified sensor; and another bare, unmodified sensor were used throughout the experiment series, including hydrocarbons. Their data were not shown for these experiments because they had no significant response at all, except for the graphenemodified sensor, which indicated a response to water vapor and CO2 (the research for this is published in another paper [33]). The lack of a figure for CH4 gas testing was explained by no sensor response observed when switching from N2 to CH4 and back. This was unusual because the CH4 absorbance of ZIF-8 is well-documented and already exploited [18,23,36,37]. However, this work did not detect any reasonable response with regards to dry N2 to CH4, wet N2 to CH4, or even air to CH4-switching compared with AZ-coated and bare CMUT sensors. Considering that the CH4\u2013ZIF-8 interaction strength of 10 kJ/mol [36] is of the order of a typical H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bond and CMUT-based sensors with H2O and CO2 with a similar bond strength bound to other functional materials have already been demonstrated [25,31,38], the vibrational environment could be a suitable explanation for such results. The ZIF-8 cage aperture size was 0.34 nm. CH4 was found to freely diffuse through ZIF-8 [39,40], demonstrating a loose methane coupling to the framework and, therefore, a low inertial mass component in the system of the adsorbed gas. The increased size of the higher hydrocarbons improved the mass loading of the target gas molecule, restricting its movement and creating more interaction points with the cage walls, therefore increasing the effective inertial mass loading onto the system and sensor response, as seen in Figures 10 and 11. However, the Ar\u2013N2 gas-switching experiment demonstrated that weak binding molecules/atoms could still interact with ZIF-8 in such an environment. The comparative response of the test sensor to Ar and N2 was relatively small when compared with higherorder hydrocarbons, yet it was noticeable and reproducible. Ar has already been shown to occupy the ZIF-8 cage by filling it with several atoms [41]; the difference in sensor responses could be attributable to the number of molecules and their weight difference in the functional material. Notably, the majority of ZIF-8 research stops at C3 or C4 hydrocarbons, with bigger molecules typically shown as having low self-diffusivity values [37]. Here, we present data showing an improved sensor response for gasoline 95 (~C8) and an additional lowered response for diesel (~C12 average, and up to C25 as the upper limit). The unique combination of AZ and ZIF-8 might play a role in enhanced diffusivity and subsequent sensor sensitivity; however, more research is needed to confirm this.\nSensors 2023, 23, 8827 16 of 19\nAdditionally, AZ+ZIF-8 composition and layer formation research has the potential to drastically improve its sensitivity to hydrocarbons, add the functionality of hydrocarbon fractionation, and possibly improve the sensor response time due to lower depth penetration when the layer thickness is decreased. The butane/propane mixture experiment demonstrated that potentially specific transitory effects could take place when the gases were switched. The effect was relatively fast (tens of seconds) and only observed with the butane/propane mixture and N2 switching. It could be attributable to the commercial use of butane/propane mixture additives such as thiolic compounds or a lack of fractional cleanliness, or it could be due to more complex mechanisms such as blocking layer formation when gases adsorb or desorb from the surface. Additionally, the observed sensor drifts in a few cases that are given in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 were not fully investigated, but they did not impact the overall direct responses to gas changes. The drift was observed only in resonators exposed to Ar and butane/propane mixture gases. These results were reproducible with different sensors functionalized the same way and in repeated experiments using the same sensors. Considering that Ar is a noble gas and that the sensor resonant frequency recovered to initial values before the next experiment, the more likely explanation for such drifts is physical, involving gas absorption kinetics rather than chemical and based on gas reactions with the sensing layer or the chemical degradation of the sensing layer. Our previous work on Gox-modified CMUT resonators showed their suitability as humidity sensors [32]. In this work, these sensors were used as an additional reference channel for humidity monitoring throughout most of the experiments. In addition to their response to water vapor, the GOx sensors exhibited a small response to the butane/propane mixture and argon gas-switching. The data are presented in Supplementary Figure S3. Considering the small response and the fact that the ZIF-8-functionalized sensor was the main research topic, the GOx response to non-H2O vapor was considered to be irrelevant for this research."

            "text": "The manufactured gravimetric CMUT sensors functionalized with an AZ+ZIF-8 compound demonstrated measurable resonance frequency shifts for various gases, including C3\u2013C25 alkanes and acetylene. This was a unique finding because no other ZIF-8 sensor has been made for such heavy hydrocarbons to the best of our knowledge. The influence of the AZ photoresist polymer was found only on mass loading and the response to water vapor, which could be easily controlled. Contrary to previous findings, the alkane gas interaction with ZIF-8 increased up to about C8 alkanes and then decreased for higherweight molecules in this unique vibrational environment. This widens the previously known useful ZIF-8 interaction range, which might apply to other ZIF-8 uses such as gas storage and gas separation. The observed resonance frequency shifts had a strong linear correspondence with the molecular weight of the alkane or alkyne used. Further layer deposition optimizations would be beneficial because thinner ZIF-8 layers demonstrated higher sensitivity to the gas molecular weight. The demonstrated CMUT sensor has potential as a safety or fractionation monitoring device in hydrocarbon-based industries such as mining, oil refining, and natural gas extraction.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/s23218827/s1, Figure S1: Long-term resonance frequency shift observed in Ar and N2 environments for the AZ+ZIF-8 sensor; Figure S2: Long-term resonance frequency shift observed in humidity-saturated N2 and butane/propane mixture environments for the AZ+ZIF-8 sensor.
