    "abstractText": "The purpose of this paper is twofold: firstly, to explore the emotional aspects underlying classroom conflict management, and secondly, to apply these notions to the contrasted analysis of two case studies. Our findings underscore the importance of examining teachers\u2019 emotional regulation to better understand their performance when dealing with conflicts that affect classroom climate. In the final section, we make suggestions for introducing this perspective into initial teacher training through the use of Virtual Reality, a scenario that would allow pre-service teachers to experiment, record and reflect on affective and attitudinal issues that are decisive for effective classroom conflict management.",

Our findings underscore the importance of examining teachers\u2019 emotional regulation to better understand their performance when dealing with conflicts that affect classroom climate. In the final section, we make suggestions for introducing this perspective into initial teacher training through the use of Virtual Reality, a scenario that would allow pre-service teachers to experiment, record and reflect on affective and attitudinal issues that are decisive for effective classroom conflict management.\nKeywords: classroom climate, emotion, secondary school, conflict resolution, teacher training, virtual reality\nINTRODUCTION\nToday\u2019s society is characterized by a multiplicity of changes. The educational context is no stranger to this situation; as a reflection of society, changes in classroom composition and newly emerging forms of interaction can affect the climate of coexistence, since there is an issue that permeates educational settings as a social and inevitable condition in human relations: school conflict.\nDespite the undoubted importance of teachers commanding the competence to manage classroom climate, according to recent reports pre-service teachers in Spain feel dissatisfied with the theoretical nature of training in this area and also consider the practical training they have received to be deficient (L\u00f3pez et al., 2017; \u00d6zen and Yildirim, 2020). According to the TALIS report (OECD, 2020), less than half (40%) of Spanish teachers reported feeling prepared to manage a class. This study also reveals that Spanish teachers spend the longest time trying to maintain order in class. Likewise, a recent study on satisfaction with the training received by students of the Official Master\u2019s degree in Teaching in Secondary Schools, at four major Spanish universities, revealed that the competence that pre-service teachers perceive as lacking the most is precisely that related to knowledge of classroom interaction and communication strategies and skills to promote coexistence, address disruptive behaviors and manage conflict in the classroom. At the end of the master\u2019s degree, only 34% of respondents provided the highest rating, although this is an improvement compared to the 19.8% that had done so at the beginning (Sarcedo-Gorgoso et al., 2020).\nConflict management competence is frequently assessed through self-report questionnaires that inquire about preferred coping patterns without taking into account the communicative situations\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 818431\nin which conflict takes place or the emotional and attitudinal variables underlying the decisions made by teachers to deal with it (Galtung, 2000; Jones, 2000). Thus, in terms of both the training and assessment of this competence, it seems necessary to design realistic learning scenarios in which teachers can experiment and reflect on their ability to manage the classroom climate in authentic communicative situations."

            "heading": "Conflict as a Communicative Experience",
            "text": "A widely held conception describes conflict as \u201can expressed struggle between at least two interdependent parties who perceive incompatible goals, scarce resources, and interference from the other party in achieving their goals\u201d (Hocker and Wilmot, 2014, p.13). Giving greater weight to affective-motivational variables, conflict has also been described as a subjective experience: \"To recognize that we are in conflict is to acknowledge that we have been triggered emotionally\u201d (Jones, 2000, p. 91).\nAligned with the latter perspective, in this article we understand conflict as a particular type of communication, defined by Luhmann (1982) as an expressed contradiction that blocks communicative processes. By blocking communication, classroom conflicts infringe upon interpersonal relationships and can give rise to disruptive events (misbehaviors or critical incidents) that hinder the development of teaching (e.g., Bingham et al., 2009; Tripp, 2012). In the present study, these events are considered conflict situations, initiated by students that can dramatically affect the classroom climate.\nWe share the ecological approach to classroom climate proposed by Doyle (2006), understood as a communicative context with characteristic purposes, dimensions, features and processes, whose particularity has consequences for the behavior of occupants of that setting. From an ecological perspective, \u201cmanagement is a complex enterprise because order is jointly accomplished by teachers and students and because a large number of immediate circumstances affect the nature of orderliness, the need for intervention, and the consequences of particular teacher and student actions\u201d (Doyle, 2006, p.100).\nFrom this standpoint, there are several important dimensions of classrooms climate that are already in place when teachers and students arrive at the classroom door. These include Multidimensionality\u2014a large quantity of events and tasks in classrooms takes place; many people, with different preferences and abilities must use a restricted supply of resources to accomplish a broad range of social and personal objectives; Simultaneity\u2014many things happen at once in classrooms. While helping an individual student during seatwork, for instance, a teacher must monitor the rest of the class, acknowledge other requests for assistance, handle interruptions, and keep track of time; Immediacy\u2014there is a rapid pace of classroom events; Unpredictability\u2014classroom events often take unexpected turns, events are jointly produced and thus it is often difficult to anticipate how an activity will go on a particular day with a particular group of students; Publicness\u2014classrooms are public places and events, especially those involving the teacher, are often witnessed by a large portion of the students; History\u2014 classes meet for 5 days a week for several months and thus accumulate a common set of experiences, routines, and norms, which provide a foundation for conducting activities for the rest of the term or year. All these factors combine to create demands and pressures on participants as activities are played out in these environments. These demands and pressures are placed especially on teachers who carry professional adult responsibility for planning and monitoring classroom activities. Ecologically, these pressures and demands are the origins of the task of classroom management. In most instances, therefore, teachers have little leisure time to reflect before acting (Doyle, 2006).\nIn addition, management demands are systematically related to the types of activities used in the classroom (Garrett, 2008; Wilkinson et al., 2020). Student work involvement or engagement is higher in teacher-led, externally paced activities than in self-paced activities. Involvement is also especially low during activities in which there are prolonged presentations. Thus, according to Doyle (2006), \u201cthe key to a teacher\u2019s success in management appears to be his or her (a) understanding of the likely configuration of events in a classroom, and (b) skill in monitoring and guiding activities in light of this information\u201d (p.116). Therefore, the effectiveness of classroom conflict management cannot be defined solely by stereotypical behavior patterns as traditional teacher education often suggests. Successful classroom management also involves aspects of the affective-attitudinal dimension that allow recognizing when and how to act to face conflict events in immediate circumstances (Evertson and Poole, 2008).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 818431\nAttitude is an important concept to understand human behavior. More relevant to the present concerns is what this controversy regarding the attitude-behavior relation implies for a definition of attitude. Allport (1935), in his influential chapter for the Handbook of Social Psychology, defines attitude as \u201ca mental and neural state of readiness, organized through experience, exerting a directive or dynamic influence upon the individual\u2019s response to all objects and situations with which it is related\u201d (p. 810). Beginning with these early tracings of the attitude concept, a large number of definitions have been offered.\nLike many psychological variables, attitude is considered a hypothetical or latent variable, rather than an immediately observable variable (Fazio, 2007). From this view, Green (1954) argued that \u201cthe concept of attitude does not refer to any one specific act or response of an individual, but is an abstraction from a large number of related acts or responses\u201d (p. 335). Zanna and Rempel\u2019s (1988) formulation added that \u201cthe attitude may be based on appraisals of the attributes that characterize the object, as in expectancyvalue frameworks\u201d (p. 608). According to this view, any such automatic activation of the attitude is viewed as playing a critical role in the process by which an attitude may exert influence on information processing, judgment, and behavior. Indeed, from its outset, this theoretical conceptualization of attitudes has been embodied within a model attempting to specify the process(es) by which attitudes \u201cguide\u201d behavior (Fazio, 2007). This definition may help understand how attitudes can explain the strategies that teachers use to regulate the emotional experiences that are activated during the management of classroom conflict. These attitudinal aspects seem linked to actions that teachers take to create an environment that supports and facilitates both academic and social-emotional Learning (Emmer and Stough, 2001).\nEmotion regulation refers to \u201cthe processes by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express these emotions\u201d (Gross, 1998, p. 275). The regulation of emotion is defined predominantly in terms of the conscious or volitional selfregulation of emotion. In other words, emotion regulation means the capability to manage the emotional experiences and expressions (Gross, 2002). As stated Evertson and Poole (2008), in relational interactions trust is a key component of an effective classroom. \u201cDespite the best laid plans, student misbehavior will occur. Reactions to this misbehavior require careful planning to ensure a teacher\u2019s responses are productive\u201d (p.136)."

            "text": "As Ekman (1985) and Dam\u00e1sio (1999) have convincingly demonstrated, the behavioral element of emotion is projected in the forms of expression of subjective emotional experience (facial expressions, tone of voice, gestures and body postures) that we communicate intentionally or unintentionally. Considering this primary condition, when conflicting events occur during interactions with students, some physiological changes and verbal and non-verbal emotional expressions will occur that will be\nconsciously perceived by teachers and observed by their students. These signals trigger in both certain modes of action (Sutton, 2004; Keller and Becker, 2020).\nFollowing Lazarus (1991), the emotional activation\u2014tendency toward action\u2014that we experience when facing conflicts could be caused by an incongruence with expectations or by the occurrence of an unforeseen event. This activation, in turn, instigates a personal interpretation (appraisals) of the communicative situation, which determines the qualities of the emotions that are projected, and these will affect the strategy implemented to manage the conflict. For example, a student\u2019s defiant behavior can be appraised, with different resultant teacher emotional responses, as a threat to a teacher\u2019s authority or as a sign of a student being over-challenged by the work task. Variations in appraisals occur because situations can be interpreted in different ways as a result of personal characteristics, social history and cultural expectations (Schutz et al., 2007).\nAcademic emotions refer to a set of emotions that are experienced by students and teacher in learning or teaching situations (Pekrun, 2006). They are short-lived and intense active states that arise in response to a particular stimulus. Academic emotional valence refers to whether the stimulus is pleasant or unpleasant, while academic emotional arousal describes the academic emotional intensity that a stimulus can cause. Based on this classification, emotions can be divided into four groups: positive arousal emotions (e.g., enjoyment, pride), positive emotions (e.g., enthusiasm, interest), passive arousal emotions (e.g., anger, anxiety), and negative emotions (e.g., frustration, depression) (Pekrun, 2006).\nEmotional experiences were found to emerge during teacher judgments regarding perceived success (Schutz et al., 2007). Thus, teachers may experience happiness when an instructional objective is met or students follow directions, and pride comes when students excel or eclipse their peers or give a response or fulfill some tasks that teachers did not expect them to complete. They report frustration when students cannot grasp a concept; anger with misbehavior, disappointment with lack of effort, and anxiety when competence is challenged (Sutton et al., 2009; Cubukcu, 2013). These emotions often arise from management and disciplinary classroom interactions, and teachers report that they try to regulate these emotions frequently because they believe it helps them achieve their goals (Sutton, 2004).\nGuilt is an unpleasant feeling due to the nature of caring and feeling responsible for students, and it is commonly felt by teachers who perceive they could not do what they were supposed to do and led to disappointment in others (van Veen and Lasky, 2005). Frustration and anger arise from several sources related to thwarted goals, including students\u2019 misbehavior and violation of rules (Cubukcu, 2013). Teachers also become angry when they believe that students\u2019 poor academic work is due to controllable factors, such as laziness or inattention.\nMany teachers report that their anger and frustration lead to changes in their classroom behaviors and coping strategies. Intrusive thoughts make it difficult for them to concentrate on what they are doing before the emotion episode, and that students are the immediate target of the anger and frustration (Sutton, 2007).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 818431\nPositive emotions such as joy, enthusiasm, gratitude, admiration, interest, satisfaction, optimism, and others lead to proactive attitudes that foster conciliation and collaboration (Montes et al., 2014). It has also been observed that, in critical situations, the activation of positive emotional states allows consideration and elaboration of plans for future action (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005), while the use of predominantly reactive strategies has been associated with teachers\u2019 stress and emotional exhaustion (Clunies-Ross et al., 2008; Tsouloupas et al., 2010; Pedditzi et al., 2021).\nNegative emotions, such as fear, anger, sadness, and guilt, are associated with reactive/adaptive behaviors that are activated in response to immediate events (Frijda, 1986; Sutton, 2007). Conflicts that emerge in teacher-student interactions are a source of these types of emotions. For example, Oplatka and Iglan (2020) found that primary and secondary school teachers reported experiencing some form of fear in interactions with their students during lessons. Two coping strategies emerged in the interviewees\u2019 accounts, ranging from passive strategies that avoid directly confronting the source of the fear (e.g., emotional disengagement) to more active strategies that target the source of the fear (e.g., peer involvement, humor, etc.).\nPositive and negative emotions are important activators of the attitudes that guide behavior, since a positive mood can facilitate creative, holistic and more flexible problem solving, whereas negative emotions can promote a more rigid and analytical way of thinking (Rockladge and Fazio, 2018). Deactivation emotions, such as boredom, disappointment, sadness or despair are detrimental to any deep treatment of information related to the teaching task, whilst relaxation and relief can reduce the attention (Pekrun and Schutz, 2007). As Emmer and Stough (2001) emphasize, from an ecological perspective on teaching, classroom management can be defined as any of the actions that teachers perform to maintain student attention, and through this, to create an environment that fosters both academic and social-emotional development.\nSeveral studies (von Gilsa and Zapf, 2013; Taxer and Gross, 2018; Chang, 2020) showed that surface acting (e.g., hiding anger and fear) is significantly linked to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and inefficacy. Conversely, the teacher\u2019s emotional authenticity fosters adaptive emotional reactions in students that is higher levels of enjoyment and lower levels of anger and anxiety (Keller and Becker, 2020).\nIn relation to anger, Chang and Taxer (2020) found that this attitude leads teachers to employ punitive strategies, especially when students\u2019 misbehavior is seen as intentional and controllable. Although they may be effective in the short term, teachers\u2019 coercive behaviors have been linked to the existence of escalating disruption-coercion-disruption loops (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2020).\nIn contrast, as corroborated by Chang and Taxer (2020) in their study on emotion regulation strategies in response to classroom misbehavior, teachers who typically reappraise have the least negative affective experiences in the context of student misbehavior and are less likely to suppress their in-the-moment negative emotions. The prevalent premise of \u2018Don\u2019t show them!\u2019 (Sutton, 2004, p. 379) when it comes to teachers regulating their\nnegative emotions is to be welcomed because of the emotional contagion processes (Keller and Becker, 2020, p.13). These results are also consistent with several studies that have found that engaging in emotional perspective-taking allows teachers to react appropriately to disruptive behavior (Evertson and Weinstein, 2006; Barr, 2011). Similarly, teachers who expressed close relationships with disruptive students also described emotional perspective-taking, empathy, and emotion regulation (McGrath and Van Bergen, 2019). These characteristics are likely to be particularly helpful when forming relationships with disruptive students by guiding effective classroom management (Garner, 2010) and supporting a positive classroom climate (Jennings and Greenberg, 2009)."

            "text": "In order to assess the strategies that teachers use to manage classroom conflict, one of the most widespread models in educational research is the \u201cRahim\u201d Model of Conflict Management (Rahim, 1983). This model describes conflict and negotiation processes by referring to two basic dimensions: concern for self (i.e., the degree to which they aim to address their own concern in conflict management processes) and concern for others (i.e., the degree to which individuals try to address the concern of the other party involved in a conflict).\nOn the basis of different combinations of these two dimensions, five strategies for managing interpersonal conflict in the teacher-student relationship have been distinguished: (1) Integration (e.g., reasoning with the student inside or outside the classroom; involving the student in individual and group settings to discuss the behavior that causes the potential conflict event); (2) Compromise (e.g., reasoning and discussing issues and problems with the student and/or with the whole class to explore new possible solutions and ways of dealing with the individual and relational difficulties that arose); (3) Obliging (for example, deliberately ignoring interruptions or minor infractions); (4) Avoidance (e.g., delaying discussion and confrontation about individual and relational difficulties that arose; sending student to see the principal); and, finally, imposing and authoritarian strategies, such as (5) Domination (e.g., issuing a verbal reprimand; asking the student to leave class; imposing sanctions) (Morris-Rothschild and Brassard, 2006; Montes et al., 2014; Dog\u030can, 2016; Claessens et al., 2017).\nHowever, according to Galtung (2000), identifying behavior is not enough for effective conflict management. Conflict transformation requires attention to three interrelated elements, which the author called the \u201ctriadic model.\u201d In this model, Galtung places the following three elements in a pyramid shape: (A) underlying attitudes of all the parties involved in the conflict toward the conflict issue; (B) overt behavior in relation to the conflict and interaction with the opponent; and (C) the conflict itself, which Galtung calls \u2019contradiction.\u2019\nIn short, identifying the role of emotions seems essential to better understand the nature of conflict. Emotional processing in all its complexity\u2014including the components of emotional expression through verbal behaviors, the transparency of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 818431\nemotional states that are projected in non-verbal language (facial expressions, tone of voice and body posture) and the appraisal of emotional experiences driven by emotional arousal\u2014provide clues to the choices teachers make when managing classroom conflict. The key is to recognize the inevitability of emotions in the face of conflict and to view them as a tool for managing conflict, rather than as an obstacle or something to avoid. The question is how this approach can be used to help teachers to better manage classroom conflict."

Previously, before the first internship period, students (pre-service teachers) are expected to participate actively in the guided activities (workshops, practicum seminars) and supervised activities (group and individual tutorials) offered in this master\u2019s degree with the objective to help them prepare for their internship.\nSpecifically, the work assigned to pre-service teachers in the first stage (Block 1) consisted of carrying out a participant observation in a classroom (step 1, shown in Figure 1) during the first internship period (step 2). The observations were carried out simultaneously by two or three students who were at the same educational establishment. Educational establishments must be part of the school network promoted by the Department of Education of the Catalan Government. Priority will be given to schools and institutions with a skills-based curriculum aligned with the kind of teaching proposals promoted in this master\u2019s degree. The pre-service teachers were asked to produce a\nreflective description of the development of the lesson they observed in the form of a narrative essay (step 3).\nThe essay is structured into four sections. The first section consists of a description of the context in which the observed activity takes place, making reference to the characteristics that may influence everyday life, teaching and learning and a brief presentation of the pupils in the classroom, focusing on their learning processes, and of the teacher, focusing on his/her teaching processes, as well as a description of the educational spaces (e.g., classroom organization). The second section describes the organization of the observed activity (topic, general competences and objectives, methodology, resources, organization of the space, etc.). The third section details the observations during the development of the activity. Finally, the preservice teacher is required to write a reflection on the observed students\u2019 prospects of future development in the adolescent stage. Given the interpretative nature of this section, its content has not been included in the analysis presented in this paper.\nSupplementary Appendix 1 shows the observation guidelines, in the form of guiding questions, which are given to pre-service teachers to help them record the required evidence during the first internship period. They must actively engage in the tasks set by their school mentors. They also need to collect evidence of the work done at their host school/educational establishment both to include in their portfolios and to have sufficient data for the educational proposal that pre-service teachers will need to design and implement in their next internship period (steps 4, 5, and 6, shown in Figure 1). Preservice teachers\u2019 performance at the host school and the quality of their essay will be also taken into account to assess this first block. The narrative essay with the recorded observations is assessed by the student\u2019s academic tutor at the university. This assessment takes into account the quality of the evidence presented, as well as the student\u2019s argumentation of his/her interpretation. School mentors will assess the preservice teachers\u2019 behavior in this first internship period. To pass the course students are also expected to display a professional attitude and professional skills such as respect, cooperation, punctuality and active listening and participation. In any case, students are expected to respect the deontological ethics of the teaching profession.\nThe first and second authors of this paper have been teaching this module for several years. For this study, we selected two essays that narrate classes observed in state schools located in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, which has high percentages of immigrant and working-class population. The class groups were made up of boys and girls of this social profile, between 15 and 16 years of age, in the 4th year of the 2nd education cycle\u2014 the last level of Compulsory Secondary Education in Spain. In both cases, the lessons developed a contemporary history topic and were taught by teachers (all female) who were experienced in the subject matter. The difference between the two cases was the methodology used to teach the content and to manage the disruptive events that occurred during the class (please, see Supplementary Material with translation of the observation records: Case A and Case B).\nThe schools, students and teachers who supported the pre-service teachers during their placements where these\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 818431\nobservations were made were informed of the prospect of having evidence of their work published for academic purposes and anonymously, thereby gaining their explicit consent."

By doing so, co-researchers must be aware of the importance of the collaborative aspect of the method and of developing a negotiated understanding of a text (Rapport, 2010).

Coding discrepancies were discussed and agreements about coding and modifications to the coding scheme were reached to mediate ambiguity in the coding scheme going forward.\nIn a second stage, seeking in-depth understanding and explanation, we identified in each of the delimited segments the dimensions of the triadic model proposed by Galtung (2000): (A) underlying affects and attitudes toward the conflict issue; (B) teacher behavior toward the conflict and his/her interaction with the student(s) giving rise to the conflict situation; and (C) the conflict itself, which consists of the \u201ccontradiction\u201d perceived by the teacher. At this stage, following the cross-case analysis procedure outlined by Miles and Hueberman (1994), we used an analysis strategy geared toward transcendent themes and categories.

The classroom interaction followed the specific pattern of teacher initiates a question, student responds and teacher evaluates the response (Trigwell et al., 1999). In a reactive manner, the teacher occasionally stopped at the most critical incidents, calling for order from a position of power that left no room for negotiation. In contrast, the teacher in \u201cCase B\u201d made strategic use of different discursive resources, both to present the content and to manage disruptive behaviors during the lesson. She adopted the learner-centered paradigm (Reigeluth et al., 2017), facilitating collaborative and self-regulated learning, and providing authentic learning experiences, such as how to understand historical events through enquiry into the life of a person relevant to the community.

According to Galtung\u2019s (2000) theoretical\nmodel, in this case the teacher opted for resolution actions. Instead of engaging in dialog to transform the communicative situation, she only managed critical conflicts, with specific, reactive and punitive actions. Poor class management led to an abrupt closure, with no time to point out the continuation of the didactic unit, in front of a class that was eagerly awaiting the moment to escape from the classroom."

            "heading": "Three Essential Ideas for Understanding Classroom Conflict From an Emotional Perspective",
            "text": "We will now discuss the premises backed up by our study, based on the empirical findings presented in the previous section.\nFirstly, conflict can be understood as a communicated contradiction that can block communicative processes (Luhmann, 1982), depending on the emotional experience it promotes (Jones, 2000). This idea is furthered by Galtung (2000), whose theory has shown that for conflict transformation it is not enough to focus on behavioral elements, such as coping patterns. Galtung insists on the need to identify the non-visible elements in a conflict situation, such as the attitudes of all parties toward the conflict issue, as well as to discover the origin of the contradictions that cause it. As pointed out in the introduction, usually only one or two parts of the triad are addressed in teacher\ntraining, such as the contradiction (the conflict itself) and the behaviors displayed by the opponents. What is largely ignored are the motives and attitudes underlying the reaction to the conflict. As suggested by Fazio (2007), in order to understand the role that attitudes play in determining behavior, it is important to look at the process, motivations and affective experiences involved. \u201cIn particular, negative attitudes promote avoidance behavior. In contrast, a positive attitude encourages approach behavior, which creates the possibility of information gain and a more nuanced understanding of the object\u201d (Rockladge and Fazio, 2018, p. 517).\nSecondly, and in relation to the above, regarding we would like to highlight the role of emotions in the origin and management of conflict. As Jones (2000) notes, we know that we have entered a conflict because we get the feeling that something is not going well. This perception is linked to the imminent involuntary emotional expressions that are activated when we face in tense situations such as an interpersonal conflict. In classroom interactions, these verbal and non-verbal expressions are not only consciously perceived by teachers, but they are also observed by their students (Keller and Becker, 2020) and they result in ways of action that are more or less geared toward resolution, depending on the nuances of emotional activation that takes place in the interactions surrounding conflict management (Lazarus, 1984; Chang and Taxer, 2020). Our results are in in line with previous reports that showed these emotional experiences often arise from management and disciplinary classroom interactions, and teachers report that they try to regulate these emotions frequently because they believe\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 818431\nit helps them achieve their goals (Sutton, 2004; van Veen and Lasky, 2005; Schutz et al., 2007; Sutton et al., 2009; Cubukcu, 2013).\nThus, positive affective states lead to proactive responses (Montes et al., 2014), while negative affective states are linked to reactive responses ranging from dominance to avoidance (Oplatka and Iglan, 2020), as observed in the analysis of Case A. This notion fits in with the ecological approach to classroom climate. From this perspective, according to Doyle (2006), successful classroom management also involves aspects of the affective-attitudinal dimension, which is manifested in the way the teacher organizes and monitors the different events that make up the lesson. In this sense, the decisions teachers make determine when and how they act to deal with conflict events, with the immediacy that classroom climate management demands. In our study, the differences between the pedagogical approaches used by the two teachers help to understand the greater or lesser difficulty they had in managing the classroom. The amount of time teachers spend organizing and directing students, interacting with individual students, and dealing with inappropriate and disruptive behavior is linked to the type of activity and the physical arrangements of the setting (Doyle, 2006). Studies suggest that the greater the amount of student choice and mobility and the greater the complexity of the social scene, the greater the need for overt monitoring and managing actions by teachers (Garrett, 2008; Wilkinson et al., 2020). Positive teacherstudent relationships are seen as the very core of effective classroom management, as confirmed in our analysis of Case B. In contrast, as found in Case A, the external reward and punishment strategies are not seen as optimal for promoting academic and social emotional growth and self-regulated behavior (Evertson and Weinstein, 2006; Evertson and Poole, 2008).\nFinally, the third premise that our study ratifies complements the two previous ones and leads us to understand conflict management strategies from an emotional perspective. In this regard, we find the reinterpretation of the Dual Concern Model (Rahim, 1983) convincing. This approach states that people choose different ways, different strategies, to manage conflicts based on two primary motivations or interests: concern for self and concern for others. In classroom climate management, this notion is linked to the pedagogical approach that the teacher uses to develop the lesson, which may be centered around the teacher\u2019s authority to impose what and how to learn (Trigwell et al., 1999) or on the students\u2019 interest and abilities to construct knowledge, guided by the teacher (Reigeluth et al., 2017). Teachers regarded the use of an effective teaching method as a prerequisite to cope with inappropriate behaviors while managing their classes (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2020; \u00d6zen and Yildirim, 2020). The first approach, a teacher-centered classroom, as evidenced in Case A \u201cThe tale of a digital book,\u201d leads to reactive strategies geared toward resolution and characterized by domination or avoidance; the second approach, student-centered learning, as observed in Case B \u201cThe tale of the local parish priest,\u201d results in proactive strategies based on dialog, such as the integration of viewpoints\nand compromise with new ways of acting to overcome conflict, in the short and long term."

            "text": "Our second objective, of a practical nature, was to apply the theory to the analysis of two different cases of classroom conflict management in a lower secondary school. The results of this analysis allowed us to identify the role that the affectiveattitudinal component may be playing in the decisions taken by the teachers in both cases to manage the conflict events that occurred in class.\nBeginning with the interpretable aspects, such as the contradictions that cause conflicts, in our study we found that the conflicts were mostly non-violent, disruptive events that affected the classroom climate and occurred occasionally when teachers\u2019 expectations regarding class monitoring and student participation failed (Evans et al., 2019).\nIn relation to the affective-attitudinal component, as Galtung (2000) argues, the appraisal of emotional experiences driven by emotional arousal allows us to understand the decisions the teachers made to manage classroom conflicts. Thus, in Case A, we found causal relationships between attitudes of anger and frustration and coping strategies based on domination (repeated verbal reprimands or the imposition of sanctions) or avoidance (delaying the discussion or intentionally ignoring the confrontation). This link is consistent with findings from similar studies mentioned in the literature review (P\u00e9rez-Fuentes, 2011; Chang and Taxer, 2020).\nWe also found that the use of predominantly reactive or surface acting strategies (e.g., hiding anger and fear), such as those observed in the teacher in Case A, can lead to teacher stress and emotional exhaustion (Clunies-Ross et al., 2008; Tsouloupas et al., 2010; von Gilsa and Zapf, 2013; Chang, 2020; Pedditzi et al., 2021).\nOn the contrary, emotional perspective-taking, empathy, and emotion regulation would have allowed the teacher in Case A to establish a constructive dialog with the students involved in the conflict communicative situations, leading to a more effective classroom climate management, as demonstrated by several studies cited previously (Jennings and Greenberg, 2009; Garner, 2010; McGrath and Van Bergen, 2019).\nThese notions were confirmed in the study of Case B. The teacher\u2019s attitudes to conflict events denoted enthusiasm and empathy, which led to the use of collaborative strategies such as engagement (reasoning and discussing issues and problems with the student and/or the whole class to explore possible new solutions and ways of dealing with the individual and relational difficulties that arose) and integration (involving students in reasoning about the causes of the potential conflict event), even including being indulging, a compliant coping style with the other party, such as deliberately ignoring disruptions or minor infractions. Similar links were found by Montes et al. (2014) in a study based on self-referrals. Moreover, as also noted by Lyubomirsky et al. (2005), these strategies prevented the escalation of conflicts and enabled the teacher in Case B to timely\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 818431\ntransform the attitudes and behavior of students involved in the conflict events that emerged during class.\nIn summary, in line with arguments by Galtung (2000) and Jones and Bodtker (2001), in this study we have corroborated that a full appreciation of the elements presents in the conflict communicative situations that emerge during class facilitates their understanding. Understanding regulation in terms of conscious or volitive self-regulation (Gross, 1998, 2002), becoming aware of emotional experiences will help teachers to regulate their emotions during conflict management. In particular, identifying affective and attitudinal states and the nature of the strategies that are implemented to manage conflict could contribute to the re-evaluation necessary to change one\u2019s own emotional experience\u2014a process without which complex and effective conflict resolution is not possible\u2014and this would consequently lead to better classroom climate management by teachers (Evertson and Poole, 2008)."

            "heading": "CONCLUSION",
            "text": "This study allowed us to draw at least the following conclusions. Firstly, we believe that exploring the affective attitudinal aspects underlying classroom conflicts presents opportunities for teachers to learn how to manage them productively, but this is not enough. Successful classroom management also involves cognitive dimensions such as understanding and interpretation, skills that are necessary to recognize when and how to act to deal with conflict events in the classroom (Sutton, 2004; Chang and Taxer, 2020).\nSecondly, and linked to the above, based on the ecological approach to classroom climate (Doyle, 2006), our study provides evidence that confirm the teachers\u2019 actions in highly taxing situations involve making immediate decisions. In this regard, teachers require training to recognize the affective cues that trigger various reactive and ineffective automatic response patterns, and to become proactive in implementing strategies to reduce the impact of these triggers, thereby increasing their sense of efficacy (Evertson and Poole, 2008; Zee and Koomen, 2016).\nFinally, given that emotions are considered inseparable from the educational context in which they emerge, paying attention to explanations of significant emotional experiences after they have occurred can help teachers identify and characterize emotionally relevant \u201ccourses of action\u201d developed in the classroom for classroom climate management (Marsick and Sauquet, 2000; Evans et al., 2019).\nThe present study has some limitations and, accordingly, we suggest additional directions for future research. The data analyzed in this paper come from the reported observations of interactions in two secondary school classrooms performed by preservice teachers in their first contact with an educational institution. Although guided, consensual and supervised, the written narratives may be incomplete and may even contain interpretive biases. Future studies may expand the sample of cases, including a wider variety of disciplines and socioeducational contexts. In addition, it would be interesting to complement the observational records with interviews with\nstudents and teachers in order to investigate the experiences and motivations underlying the emotional experiences provoked by classroom conflicts. These options would minimize the high level of inference created by the analysis of reported narratives by 3rd parties, as well as make an ethical commitment to the participants, whose voices remain absent in this work.\nOther data sources, such as descriptions of conflict cases reported by in-service teachers, could provide more authentic content. Expert teachers with academic standing (\u201cgood teachers\u201d), teacher trainers and educational counselors could also provide information on the characteristics of the most common conflict situations in lower secondary schools, possible causes and ideas about more and less appropriate coping strategies."

The magic circle is an imaginary place in which what happens inside the circle has no consequences outside the circle. Within the circle, the rules of the game apply. It is a safe place where one can fail without fear of affecting \u201creal life.\u201d\nVirtual Reality is a perfect example of the magic circle, a place where you can \u201cget it wrong\u201d and repeat it as many times as you want.

These realistic scenarios could place the teacher in an authentic classroom situation in which it would be essential to interact with a group of students (represented in avatars) and make multiple decisions immediately to achieve a classroom climate favorable to the achievement of educational goals (Doyle, 2006). This would be an ideal scenario to implement the much-needed practical training, in which teachers can experiment and reflect on their ability to manage the classroom climate.\nThe three distinguishing features of VR are \u201cInteractionImmersion-Imagination.\u201d These characteristics are believed to facilitate experience specific and contextualized learning while increasing student motivation and commitment (Ke et al., 2020). Nonetheless, probably the biggest advantage of VR is that it allows users to embody learning experiences in such a way that it produces intense and real emotional sensations (Stavroulia et al., 2019). This feature helps teachers feel they are learning within a real environment, from an ecological learning perspective that enhances and fosters the transfer of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 12 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 818431\nknowledge, professional skills, and real-life management models. Only in a realistic environment can the users face the fear that newly qualified teachers experience when facing students (Oplatka and Iglan, 2020).\nBased on the results obtained in this study, we find three very powerful reasons to favor VR for the training of future teachers. First, the communication blocks that occurs during a conflict can be realistically recreated in the virtual environment so that future teachers can learn to unblock them. Second, in order to recognize conflict, there must be a feeling that something is not right (Jones, 2000), which can only come about through direct experience. The possibility of recreating realistic environments can make it possible for the user to get such a feeling. Third, through effective feedback to the user, virtual reality allows the training of the most effective communication strategies depending on the type of conflict generated. For example, a situation could be simulated in which, after having driven the teacher to anger, he or she is taught to practice strategies other than domination or avoidance.\nRegarding this last point, it is worth highlighting the capacity of current technologies for emotion detection, as studies in other fields, such as medicine, have shown (Kazemitabar et al., 2021). As noted in the introduction, the behavioral element of emotion is projected in facial expressions, tone of voice, gestures and body postures. If we add to these the content of the message or even the user\u2019s biometric measurements (such as heart rate, skin conductance or pupil size), machine learning techniques can allow us to detect the emotions felt by the user in real time. For example, we could tell if the future teacher is angry and adapt the simulation to this situation accordingly.\nThe use of virtual simulations is increasingly seen as an opportunity to provide pre-service teachers with unique opportunities to experience examples of classroom life in a controlled and structured manner (McGarr, 2021). However, we believe that, in addition to VR, the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) must incorporate technologies capable of detecting users\u2019 emotions. In the VLE, rather than mechanically executing an actual sequence of instructional events, learning involves dynamic and complex interpersonal interaction skills. Thus, the experiences provided by VR learning can foster reflective and critical learning about effective classroom climate management.\nFuture research should also aim to examine the shortand long-term outcomes associated with emotionally generated conflict management approaches in a variety of conflict situations\nto be presented in context. Detailed observations of classroom interactions, such as those described in this study, will allow the creation of the algorithms responsible for modeling the behavior of the avatars that will form part of the virtual world. In this regard, it is important to carry out a broader study of recurrent critical incidents in secondary school classrooms, which can be provided by the pre-service teachers themselves and by expert teachers. Otherwise, a virtual classroom would be created where students would not present realistic behaviors, the virtual world would not be credible to the user and disengagement would occur. Moreover, VR simulated cases for performance analysis in a playful learning context do not compromise assessment and reputation. This can be very enriching for teachers, who often lament the theoretical nature of their training and ineffective practical approaches, where they have no opportunity for self-reflection or obtaining constructive feedback on their own performances."
