1. **Investigate the relationship between human capital and innovation performance in different industries.** The study focused on high-tech enterprises, but it would be interesting to see if the same relationships hold true in other industries. This could help to identify generalizable patterns and develop more effective strategies for managing human capital to improve innovation performance.


2. **Examine the impact of different types of human capital on innovation performance.** The study considered three types of human capital: general, technical, and executive. However, there are many other types of human capital that could be relevant to innovation performance, such as creative, social, and emotional intelligence. Future research could explore the impact of these other types of human capital on innovation performance.


3. **Investigate the role of human capital in the innovation process.** The study focused on the relationship between human capital and innovation performance, but it did not examine the role of human capital in the innovation process itself. Future research could explore how human capital contributes to different stages of the innovation process, such as idea generation, development, and implementation.


4. **Examine the impact of human capital on innovation performance in different countries.** The study was conducted in China, but it would be interesting to see if the same relationships hold true in other countries. This could help to identify cultural or institutional factors that influence the relationship between human capital and innovation performance.


5. **Develop a model to predict innovation performance based on human capital.** The study found that human capital has a significant impact on innovation performance, but it did not develop a model to predict innovation performance based on human capital. Future research could develop such a model, which could be used by managers to identify the types of human capital that are most important for driving innovation in their organizations.
