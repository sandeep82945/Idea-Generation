"This study revealed that farmers in semi-arid areas seek alternative techniques to improve water productivity and efficient use of resources. The use of idle backyard homestead gardens with water harvesting techniques could help alleviate pressure on less productive and environmentally fragile agroecosystems. IRWH and intercropping management practices show great potential for increasing nutrition and possibly income in rural communities where hunger and malnutrition are frequent. Future efforts toward crop improvement, such as manure application and introducing green mulch along with optimal management practices, could lead to higher productivity in the context of a changing climate."
