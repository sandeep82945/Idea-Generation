            "text": "Over the past few decades, the widespread and excessive utilization of antibiotics has caused severe serious environmental pollution,1\u20133 which has been of wide concern due to its risks to human health. Tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH), as one of the extensively used antibiotics for disease prevention and disease cures, has been frequently detected in water environments, such as groundwater, surface water, and even drinking water.4\u20136 Because TCH is difficult to completely metabolize in the body of humans and animals, most of the antibiotics may enter the aquatic environment with fecal and urine excretion due to the untreated or incomplete processing of feces.5 The problem of antibiotics pollution has seriously threatened the security of human health and living organisms. Thus, it is urgent to rapidly and effectively eliminate TCH.\nTraditional water treatment technologies (such as membrane ltration and adsorption) cannot effectively destroy TCH from aqueous solution and they just transfer pollutants from one phase to another.7,8 Moreover, the sludge also needs to be further treated. Compared to conventional water treatment methods, photocatalysis and sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation process (SR-AOP) have been demonstrated to be\nngineering, Anhui Science and Technology 33100, China.

See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nviable, eco-friendly and ideal technology for the degradation of refractory organic pollutants in aquatic environments.9\u201311 Moreover, photocatalysis and SR-AOP demonstrated the positive synergetic interaction because persulfate (PS) could accept photogenerated electrons (e\u2212) to produce reactive oxygen species, which decreased the recombination of the photogenerated e\u2212\u2013hole (h+) pairs.12\nTherefore, the development of the cost-effective photocatalyst during photocatalytic oxidation process is crucial.13 Among the photocatalytic materials, TiO2 has attracted increasing attention due to its excellent photocatalytic activity, suitable, good stability, and nontoxicity.14,15 However, the widespread application of TiO2 was limited by its crucial disadvantages. Due to its large energy bandgap (3.2 eV), TiO2 only could be induced in the ultraviolet (UV) light region, not the visible light.16 The e\u2212 and h+ could be prone to rapid recombination, which further reduces the photocatalytic activity.17 To overcome these shortcomings, TiO2 may be subjected to modications at ESI materials.\u2020 14,16,18 As an excellent support candidate, graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) not only has good chemical stability, non-toxicity, and low cost,14,15,19 but also has a small bandgap of 2.7 eV to absorb wide visible light (<460 nm) from the solar spectrum and improve photodegradation performance of pollutants.15,20,21 Moreover, g-C3N4 has been successfully employed as co-catalyst to effectively increase the photocatalytic performances of TiO2 due to enhancing the light harvesting and decreasing the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs.22\u201324\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 8383\u20138393 | 8383"

Therefore, the researchers used conductive materials (such as Fe, Al, Mg, Ni, Cu, La, and Ag) to prepare a novel all-solid-state Zscheme photocatalysts.16,25\u201327 Lanthanum (La), as one of the rare-earth metal elements, has been investigated widely and could effectively improve the photocatalytic activity as well as suppress the recombination of the photogenerated e\u2212\u2013h+ pairs due to their special 4f electronic conguration.13,28,29\nIn this study, La/TiO2@g-C3N4 was synthesized and its characteristics were evaluated.

The two characteristic peaks of C 1s exhibited in Fig. 4b at 284.7 eV and 288.4 eV are correspond to the sp2 carbon (C]C) and the sp3 C]N bonds of the synthesized g-C3N4, respectively.11,38 The N 1s spectrum in Fig. 4c could be divided into two main characteristic peaks at 398.4 eV and 400.7 eV, which corresponded to C]N\u2013C bonds and C\u2013N\u2013H bonds.36,38,39 Fig. 4d presented the Ti 2p spectra of TiO2. It is clear that two peaks at 458.8 eV and 464.4 eV were ascribed to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, which conrmed the existence of TiO2.36,39 As shown in Fig. 4e, the La 3d spectrum displayed the splitting of La 3d5/2 and La 3d3/2 at around 835.7 eV and 852.2 eV, respectively. Therefore, the La 3d XPS prole observed in La/TiO2@g-C3N4 illustrated that all the La species were present in its oxide form.13,40 The O 1s XPS spectra and peak separation details of La/TiO2@g-C3N4 are presented in Fig. 4f and the O 1s spectra primarily consisted of two characteristic absorption peaks located close to 530.3 eV and 531.6 eV, corresponding to the lattice oxygen of TiO2 and La2O3, respectively.13\nThe N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm was employed to understand the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) specic surface areas (SBET), pore volume and pore diameter distribution of TiO2, g-C3N4, and La/TiO2@g-C3N4 and the result was shown in Table S2.\u2020 According to the BET theory, pure TiO2 had a high surface area of 43.1 m2 g\u22121, while g-C3N4 had a relatively low surface area of 7.3 m2 g\u22121. This represented that TiO2 would be able to better capture the molecule to be degraded than that of g-C3N4. Interestingly, SBET of La/TiO2@g-C3N4 (14.2 m\n2 g\u22121) was closer to g-C3N4 due to the low content of TiO2 in La/TiO2@gC3N4. On the contrary, pore diameter of g-C3N4 was 32 nm and bigger than that of TiO2 (7.1 nm) and La/TiO2@g-C3N4 (13.98 nm). It was noteworthy that the pore volume of La/TiO2@g-C3N4 (0.046 cm3 g\u22121) is also higher than those of TiO2 (0.035 cm\n3 g\u22121) and g-C3N4 (0.027 cm\n3 g\u22121). These results clearly illustrated that the preparation process of La/TiO2@g-C3N4 possessed mesoporous structure, which could offer massive reactive surface sites to activate PDS. The UV-vis diffuse reectance spectra (DRS) was employed to estimate the light-absorption capability and the band gap of g-C3N4 and La/TiO2@g-C3N4 as well as the results were shown in Fig. 5. According to the obtained results of the DRS as displayed in Fig. 5a, the absorbances of g-C3N4 and La/TiO2@g-C3N4 were in the visible region and the basic absorption edge of g-C3N4 appeared near 450 nm. Interestingly, the UV-visible absorption wavelength edge of the La/TiO2@gC3N4 was around 465 nm due to the presence of La2O3 and TiO2.

Simultaneously, the transient photocurrent responses were recorded. Compared to g-C3N4 and TiO2, La/TiO2@g-C3N4 demonstrated a stronger transient photocurrent response. This may be attributed to the enhanced charge separation and migration efficiency resulting from the efficient heterojunction between TiO2 and g-C3N4 with La.\nIt is generally known that the smaller semicircle radius represents a faster charge transfer. The Nyquist plots of g-C3N4 and TiO2, La/TiO2@g-C3N4 were shown in Fig. S1b\u2020 and the arc radius of La/TiO2@g-C3N4 was obviously smaller than that of gC3N4 and TiO2. It further illustrated that the charge transportation was increased due to the synergy between two semiconductors TiO2 and g-C3N4."

The negligible TCH removal was obtained with visible light irradiation. The results apparently demonstrated the light irradiation was not powerful enough to generate efficient free radical to degrade TCH and TCH was photo-stable under visible light illumination on account of the negligible change (<4%).\n8388 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 8383\u20138393\nAbout 12.32% removal of TCH was obtained with only 6 mmol L\u22121 PDS due to the limited oxidation capability of PDS (E0= 2.01 V).41,42 When 0.5 g L\u22121 La/TiO2@g-C3N4 was added to TCH in the presence of PDS, the degradation rate was signicantly improved to 43.91%. The photo-degradation efficiency of TCH by the combination of visible light and La/TiO2@g-C3N4 was about 28.44% aer reaction for 60 min, which explained that visible light could promote the photocatalysis of La/TiO2@gC3N4 to generate effective free radicals. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the degradation rate of TCH by vis/PDS system was 17.79% and very low within 60 min, which illustrated that TCH was quite recalcitrant to degradation and easily accumulated in the environment. However, when TiO2 or La/TiO2 appeared separately in the vis/PDS system, the degradation rates of TCH were improved to 27.68% and 37.10%, respectively. In addition, the degradation rates of TCH reached 95.52% in the vis/La/TiO2@gC3N4/PDS system, which is higher than the TCH degradation efficiencies in the La/TiO2@g-C3N4/PDS and vis/La/TiO2@gC3N4 systems. Importantly, it is also higher than the sum efficiencies of the La/TiO2@g-C3N4/PDS and vis/La/TiO2@g-C3N4 systems, indicating that coupling visible light with La/TiO2@gC3N4 had a synergetic effect on PDS activation for TCH degradation.\nMeanwhile, the degradation of TCH was simulated by pseudo-rst-order kinetic equation by the formula given below,\nln(Ct/C0) = \u2212kt (4)\nwhere k, C0 and Ct are kinetic constant, initial concentration and nal concentration of TCH aer time t, respectively.

Obviously, the kinetic rate constant in vis/La/ TiO2@g-C3N4/PDS system was the highest among the test systems, further conrming the synergetic effect of La/TiO2@gC3N4 and visible light on PDS activation.

Higher dosage of La/TiO2@g-C3N4 would provide more active sites for PDS activation and photogenerated e\u2212\u2013h+ pairs, which further formed TCH elimination.\nThe effect of PDS concentrations (2, 4, 6, and 8 mmol L\u22121) on TCH removal was investigated (Fig. 7c).

When the PDS concentration increased from 2 to 8 mmol L\u22121, the removal rate of TCH aer 60 min increased from 86.03% to 97.18%.

The La/TiO2@g-C3N4 loading was 0.5 g L\u22121, the PDS concentration was 6 mmol L\u22121, and the initial pH was 6. The results are shown in Fig. 7d. When the initial TCH concentration increased from 10 to 40 mg L\u22121, the TCH degradation efficiency decreased from 97.29% to 90.36%. It can be ascribed to the following reasons: (i) the surface of La/ TiO2@g-C3N4 was gradually covered by the intermediates generated during the photocatalytic degradation process, which would reduce the generation of e\u2212\u2013h+ pairs and inhibit the formation of reactive species.

This phenomenon indicated SO4c\n\u2212 and cOH both were involved in the TCH degradation. The addition of EDTA and K2Cr2O7 also had a certain inhibitory effect on the photocatalytic degradation system, the kinetic constant of the TCH degradation decreased to 0.035 min\u22121 and 0.062 min\u22121, which h+ and e\u2212 played important roles in the degradation of TCH in the vis/La/TiO2@g-C3N4/PDS system. Here, the role of dissolved oxygen was observed by eliminating oxygen with bubbling N2.

Under visible light irradiation, e\u2212\u2013h+ pairs are exposed to the surface of TiO2 and g-C3N4. Owing to the different band edge potential, the e\u2212 in the conduction band of TiO2 is compounded with h+ on the valence band of g-C3N4 viametal La. Since the ECB of g-C3N4 (\u22121.14 eV) was more negative against the redox potential of O2/cO2\n\u2212 (\u22120.33 V vs.NHE),34,35O2 could accept e\u2212 on the g-C3N4 conduction band generated cO2\n\u2212, respectively. The ECB of TiO2 (2.92 eV) was more positive than the standard redox potential of cOH/H2O (2.38 V vs. NHE),36 thus H2O and h\n+ on the TiO2 price band formed cOH.
