"5 conclusion This article proposed a new biomedical RE system, K-RET, that incorporates knowledge in the form of ontologies into BERT-based systems to enrich and complement the data used for training. K-RET is a flexible system that can handle different associations, integrate knowledge from multiple sources, define where to apply the knowledge, and deal with multi-token entities. We used three independent and open-access RE datasets to test our system concerning different types of biomedical entities with different characteristics (i.e. label distribution). Allied with the three datasets, we used four knowledge bases to inject knowledge according to the type of entities involved in the candidate relations. The best-performing dataset was the DDI Corpus allied with the ChEBI knowledge base, with significant average improvements compared with the baseline in the order of 7.60% and 8.28% for F-measure and accuracy, respectively. For the BC5CDR Corpus, we also had modest improvements (an average of 1.39% and 1.35% for F-measure and accuracy), even though we did not find these results significant. Differently, for the PGR-crowd Corpus, there was no significant change in performance from the addition of knowledge. Thus, we concluded that the label distribution and relevant entity density within the training data significantly affect how our system performs. Nevertheless, we successfully demonstrated the power of adding external knowledge to training data and how to accommodate it to different domain data. In a nutshell, the K-RET system successfully added contextual knowledge, more than one knowledge source, and knowledge to multi-token entities.
