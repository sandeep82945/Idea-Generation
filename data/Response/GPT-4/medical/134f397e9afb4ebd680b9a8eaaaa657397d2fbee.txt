Mechanisms of Resistance in Fusarium graminearum: Further investigate the molecular mechanisms behind the resistance of F. graminearum to GAPJ treatment compared to the susceptibility of F. meridionale. This could involve studying the cell wall composition and metabolic pathways that confer resilience to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated by plasma.

Optimization of GAPJ Parameters for Enhanced Efficacy: Explore the optimization of GAPJ parameters such as discharge power, frequency, treatment duration, and plasma gas composition to enhance the efficacy of fungal inactivation and mycotoxin degradation. This could include testing different types of plasma gases or plasma sources to find the most effective combination for fungal and mycotoxin control in barley and other cereals.

Effects of GAPJ Treatment on Barley Grain Quality: Investigate the effects of GAPJ treatment on the nutritional quality, germination rate, and malt quality of barley grains. Assessing the impact on key quality parameters will help determine the practical applications of GAPJ in the cereal grain industry and ensure that the treatment does not adversely affect the end product.

Long-term Stability of Mycotoxins Post-Treatment: Conduct long-term studies to assess the stability of mycotoxins, especially the dynamics of DON and D3G, after GAPJ treatment during storage. This research could include studying the potential reversion of D3G back to DON and evaluating the impact of storage conditions on the stability of these compounds.

Integration of GAPJ with Other Decontamination Technologies: Investigate the potential synergies between GAPJ and other decontamination technologies, such as enzymatic treatments, adsorbents, or natural antimicrobials, for a comprehensive approach to controlling Fusarium species and mycotoxins in barley and other crops. Combining different methods could enhance overall efficacy, reduce treatment times, and potentially overcome the limitations of single treatments.
