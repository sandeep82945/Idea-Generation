    "abstractText": "The Kitaev model is an exactly solvable quantum spin model within the language of constrained real fermions. In spite of numerous studies for magnetic fields along special orientations, there is a limited amount of knowledge on the complete field-angle characterization, which can provide valuable information on the existence of fractionalized excitations. For this purpose, we first study the pure ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models for arbitrary external magnetic field directions via a mean-field theory, showing that there are many topological phases with different (or zero) Chern numbers, depending on the magnetic field strength and orientations. However, a realistic description of the candidate Kitaev materials, within the edge-sharing octahedra paradigm, requires additional coupling terms, including a large off-diagonal term along with possible anisotropic corrections p. It is therefore not sufficient to rely on the topological properties of the bare Kitaev model as the basis for the observed thermal Hall-conductivity signals, and an understanding of these extended Kitaev models with a complete field response is demanded. Starting from the zero-field phase diagram of Kp models, we identify, besides the Kitaev spin liquid phase, antiferromagnetic zigzag, ferromagnetic phases, as well as an unusual Kitaev() spin liquid phase. The magnetic field response of these phases for arbitrary field orientations provides a remarkably rich phase diagram. For an extended parameter range and just above the critical field where the zigzag phase is suppressed, there is an intermediate phase region with suppressed energy gaps and substantial spin fractionalization. To comply our findings with experiments, we also reproduce a large asymmetry in the extent of this intermediate phases specifically for the two different field directions \u03b8 = \u00b160o with respect to the normal to the plane of the honeycomb lattice.",

In spite of numerous studies for magnetic fields along special orientations, there is a limited amount of knowledge on the complete field-angle characterization, which can provide valuable information on the existence of fractionalized excitations. For this purpose, we first study the pure ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models for arbitrary external magnetic field directions via a mean-field theory, showing that there are many topological phases with different (or zero) Chern numbers, depending on the magnetic field strength and orientations. However, a realistic description of the candidate Kitaev materials, within the edge-sharing octahedra paradigm, requires additional coupling terms, including a large off-diagonal term along with possible anisotropic corrections p. It is therefore not sufficient to rely on the topological properties of the bare Kitaev model as the basis for the observed thermal Hall-conductivity signals, and an understanding of these extended Kitaev models with a complete field response is demanded. Starting from the zero-field phase diagram of K- - p models, we identify, besides the Kitaev spin liquid phase, antiferromagnetic zigzag, ferromagnetic phases, as well as an unusual Kitaev(- ) spin liquid phase. The magnetic field response of these phases for arbitrary field orientations provides a remarkably rich phase diagram. For an extended parameter range and just above the critical field where the zigzag phase is suppressed, there is an intermediate phase region with suppressed energy gaps and substantial spin fractionalization. To comply our findings with experiments, we also reproduce a large asymmetry in the extent of this intermediate phases specifically for the two different field directions \u03b8 = \u00b160o with respect to the normal to the plane of the honeycomb lattice.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043024\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe Kitaev model is an exactly solvable [1] quantum spin model with fractionalized excitations within the family of spin liquid models. Candidate materials for its Jeff = 1/2 ferromagnetic (F) realization are the iridates X2IrO3 (X: Li [2,3], Na [4\u20139]), and \u03b1-RuCl3 [10\u201325]. Recently, there is a growing interest in the search of additional materials [26\u201328] with perhaps antiferromagnetic (AF) Kitaev type couplings such as in Na3Co2SbO6-Na2Co2TeO6 [29] and theoretical studies focusing on f -electron based rare-earth oxides [30]. These quantum magnets are acclaimed to have a significantly large Kitaev type spin-spin coupling. Detailed analyses of the underlying physics and the material characteristics have been summarized in numerous reviews [31\u201337].\nThe Kitaev model is defined on a honeycomb lattice with highly anisotropic Ising type exchange couplings at each bond\n*firat.yilmaz@uni-a.de\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

It can host anyonic excitations within the real fermion language [1]. In this approach, each of the Pauli operators is replaced by two composite Majorana fermions \u03c3\u03b1j = ib\u03b1j c j , \u03b1 \u2208 {x, y, z} with the local constraint Dj = bxjbyjbzjc j = 1 at site j. The basic theoretical work in materializing such an exotic model relies on the JackeliKhaliullin mechanism [38,39]. The effective Hamiltonians for transition metals are coupled with additional (extended) edge-sharing [40,41] octahedral ligands. The destructive interference between different exchange paths via ligands can eliminate the dominant Heisenberg exchange coupling in the effective spin Hamiltonian for transition metals. Thereby the additional Kitaev and other off-diagonal terms become dominant terms. There is also the additional proposition to tune the magnitude of each term by Floquet driving [42,43]. Eventually, most of the recent work has been allocated to the theoretical [38,44\u201347] and experimental investigation of the candidate materials. Experimental data suggest that it is\n2643-1564/2022/4(4)/043024(16) 043024-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nhighly likely for the candidate materials to have a spin-liquid ground state (GS) for intermediate magnetic field strengths. This is inferred in particular through bulk probes such as the continuum of excitations in neutron-scattering experiments [48] and thermodynamic measurements such as the field-angle dependence of the specific heat [49]. A significant amount of work has also focused on alternative explanations to a spin-liquid scenario such as chiral conventional quasiparticles [50\u201353] or beyond-Kitaev model spin liquids [54]. In all approaches, the anti/ferromagnetic Kitaev term has to be supplemented by additional interactions for a realistic material specific modeling. Depending on their relative strengths, the direct relation between the thermal Hall coefficient and the Kitaev interaction becomes obscure.\nThe thermal conductivity measurements has been recognized as a useful tool to rule in/out a topological Kitaev spin-liquid due to their charge neutral energy transport. In particular, a Kitaev spin liquid in a finite magnetic field is proposed to host a half-quantized neutral edge current as its distinct signature [1]. In an applied magnetic field, a gapless, topologically trivial Kitaev liquid can turn into a gapped, topologically nontrivial phase. Measurements [14\u201320] have shown that the magnetically ordered zigzag (ZZ) phase present in this material (as a result of spin interactions beyond the pure Kitaev model) can be suppressed by an external magnetic field, followed by a region with suppressed magnetization before the system enters into a field polarized (P) phase. In this intermediate field window, thermal Hall conductivity is anomalous [55,56]. Quantized thermal Hall conductance [57,58] has been reported in this region, giving support to a topologically nontrivial spin-liquid. Moreover, this quantized thermal Hall conductance, and an associated gap opening for the bulk excitations [49], can be generated by a pure in-plane magnetic field, lending further support to the topological origin of the field-induced topological phase. However, a recent experiment has revealed an unusual oscillation in the longitudinal thermal conductivity \u03ba\u03b1\u03b1 as a function of inverse magnetic field \u03b1-RuCl3 [59] within the region of interest, which challenges some of the conclusions above. In this respect, a further characterization of this \u201cintermediate phase\u201d for arbitrary magnetic field strengths and directions could provide valuable information for the search of (non)Abelian anyons.\nIn spite of numerous studies [60\u201368] along special field directions such as [001] and [111], there exists limited knowledge on the complete field-angle dependence of \u03baxy in the Kitaev model itself. If the additional off-diagonal couplings are significant, it could be a naive approximation to relate thermal Hall coefficients to the pure Kitaev spin liquid. The studies on the candidate materials indicate the presence of a relatively large spin-orbit coupling \u03b1 term, the off-diagonal coupling on the \u03b1-bond, \u223c \u03b1 (S\u03b2j S\u03b3l + S\u03b3j S\u03b2l ) as well as the additional symmetry allowed \u03b1p terms \u223c \u03b1p (S\u03b2j S\u03b1l + S\u03b1j S\u03b2l + S\u03b3j S \u03b1 l + S\u03b1j S\u03b3l ). Reference [69] has addressed this issue and also the magnetic field effects perturbatively, yet assuming a KSL GS. In this respect, it is crucial to clarify the effect of large \u223c |K| [70,71] as well as arbitrary magnetic field orientations and strengths to understand the validity of existing results based on the putative F Kitaev GS. Naturally,\nan unbiased method is needed which takes into account spin ordering and spin liquid character on equal footing.\nIn this paper, we attempt to answer the following two questions: (1) What are the full phase diagram of the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic Kitaev models in the presence of an external magnetic field pointing in arbitrary directions? (2) What are the essential effects of the additional - p off-diagonal terms? Regarding the former, we identify a magnetization process with multiple topologically distinct phases depending on the field direction and strength. The phase boundaries are characterized by the first Chern number of the fermionic vacuum. Regarding the latter, we examine the phase diagram of the (K, , p)-model and identified four different zero-field phases: a zigzag z (ZZ-z), a ferromagnetic (F), an extended KSL, and the Kitaev- spin liquid (K SL) phase. A focus is given to the experimentally relevant ZZ-z phase, in which ferromagnetic chains are antiferromagnetically aligned perpendicular to the z bond. Our choice of the unit cell in Fig. 1 allows only for the ZZ-z phase. This discussion is elaborated further in Sec. IV B. Then, starting from the ZZ-z GS, we examine the magnetic field response as a function of the off-diagonal coupling strength . We identify a region with reduced magnetization and decreased energy gap, named as the partially fractionalized (PF) phase. This phase is found to host strong partial spin fractionalization.\nThroughout this paper, we employ a mean-field theory of the Majorana representation with local constraints. The advantage of this approach is that it readily captures the strong correlations inherent within this composite (fractionalized) representation along with the magnetic phases. We emphasize that the mean-field techniques should be considered as the pioneer strategy in the vast parameter space to guide more sophisticated yet expensive numerical techniques.\nThe article is divided into three sections. The current introductory section is completed with the discussion on the material aspects of the Kitaev model. In Sec. II, we present the mean-field theory scheme employed in this paper. Using this\n043024-2\napproach, we then identify the topological Chern invariants for the pure AF/F Kitaev model for arbitrary magnetic-field orientations and strengths. The critical field strength and the angles for topological phase transitions are determined. In Sec. III, the role of the additional off-diagonal terms, , p is examined. We complete this section by discussing the implications of our results for the recent thermal Hall experiments on candidate materials."

The realistic modeling of these specific materials requires additional terms in the spin Hamiltonian. For concernant materials, the symmetry group is D3d = {I, 2C3, 3C2, 2S6, 3M} [38,39,44,45], the symmetry allowed interactions can be cast into a general spin-spin coupling, \u03b1\u03b2i j S \u03b1 i S \u03b2 j where \u03b1\u03b1 i j \u2192 K, J and \u03b1 =\u03b2i j \u2192\n, p. The additional interactions and their role in the experimental findings are the subject of current experimental research [2,3,11\u201313,15\u201319], ab initio calculations [72], exactdiagonalization methods [73\u201375] and effective low-energy Hubbard Hamiltonians [32,76,77].\nHere, we focus on \u03b1-RuCl3 because there are several works in the literature to compare to and to ensure the validity of our approach in certain limits in \u2212 p space. \u03b1 \u2212 RuCl3 crystals have a honeycomb structure of Ru-Ru bonds for a cut in the [111] direction (see Fig. 1). The Cl atoms are aligned as edge-sharing octahedra. The additional exchange paths through Ru-Cl bonds create a destructive interference for the otherwise leading term J , the Heisenberg exchange coupling [38,39]. Therefore, a Kitaev-type exchange coupling along with and p terms takes stage. Experiments in zero magnetic field suggests a long range ZZ-z order for the GS of \u03b1-RuCl3 [2,3,11\u201313,15\u201319]. Yet, a finite magnetic field melts the magnetic order and thereby allows for a transition to a spin liquid phase [14\u201317,57].\nFor the calculations described below, we switch to a new orthogonal coordinate system (e\u03021, e\u03022, e\u03023) with the following transformation:\n\u239b \u239de\u03021e\u03022\ne\u03023\n\u239e \u23a0 = 1\u221a\n6\n\u239b \u239c\u239d 1 1 \u22122 \u2212\u221a3 \u221a3 0\u221a\n2 \u221a 2 \u221a 2\n\u239e \u239f\u23a0 \u239b \u239de\u0302xe\u0302y\ne\u0302z\n\u239e \u23a0.

            "text": "In materials like \u03b1-RuCl3 and Na2IrO3, the Kitaev exchange coupling along all bond directions are likely to be equal [38,39]. We therefore consider an isotropic Kitaev coupling, K\u03b1 = K . The isotropic model supports the trivial gapless B phase [1]. It can host two types of fractionalized excitations, the Z2 vortices and itinerant fermionic excitations, albeit a topologically trivial ground state. The system supports\na topological phase in an external magnetic field along the [111] direction and thereby an energy gap opens proportional to \u223c h3K2 [1] where h is the magnetic field strength. The resulting phase is indexed by a finite integer Chern number. The concomitant neutral anyonic excitations lead to a quantized thermal Hall conductivity, i.e., they reveal themselves by a quantized response to a temperature gradient [1]. An intimate connection between the integer valued Chern number and the \u201chalf-integer\u201d conductance arises [1].\nIn this section, we consider the Kitaev model in an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field within a mean-field theory scheme. We shall see that this approach reveals topological phase transitions as a function of the magnetic field strengths and orientations. The essential ingredients are described briefly below. An elaborated discussion of the mean-field approach is given in Appendix A where the authors discuss the detailed derivation, the role of quantum fluctuations as well as possible intrinsic bias. (Similar approaches have also been followed in Refs. [60\u201364,78\u201380].) The Hamiltonian takes the following form (\u03bcB = 1):\nHK = \u03b1\u2212bond\u2211\n\u3008i j\u3009 K\u03b1S\u03b1i S \u03b1 j \u2212 \u2211 i,\u03b2 h\u03b2S\u03b2i (3)\nwhere \u3008i j\u3009 indicates nearest-neighbor sites on the honeycomb lattice and h\u03b2 is a component of the external magnetic field. As in [1], we replace the spin operators S\u03b1j by two composite Majorana operators b\u03b1j (\u03b1 \u2208 {x, y, z}) and c j as S\u03b1j = i2 b\u03b1j c j where (b\u03b1j ) 2 = c2j = 1. This results in\nHK = K 4 \u03b1\u2212bond\u2211 \u3008i j\u3009 ib\u03b1i ciib \u03b1 j c j \u2212 i 2 \u2211 i,\u03b2 h\u03b2b\u03b2i ci. (4)\nThe Kitaev Majorana representation doubles the Hilbert space size and the physical gauge sector is retained by the local gauge condition Dj |\u03c8\u3009 = |\u03c8\u3009 where Dj = bxjbyjbzjc j . We rewrite the local constraint Dj = 1 as i b\u03b1j c j + i \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 2 b \u03b2 j b \u03b3 j = 1, where \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 is the antisymmetric rank-3 tensor. The constraint is enforced by adding the term\nH\u03bb = i 2 \u03b1\u2211 j \u03bb\u03b1j ( b\u03b1j c j + \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 2 b\u03b2j b \u03b3 j ) , (5)\nwith Lagrange multipliers, \u03bb\u03b1j to the Hamiltonian, i.e., HK \u2212 H\u03bb. The only terms that are not quadratic in Majorana variables in the Hamiltonian are the quartic terms in Eq. (4) arising from spin-spin interactions S\u03b1i S \u03b1 j in Eq. (3). We decompose these quartic terms into \u3008ib\u03b1i ci\u3009 \u00d7 ib\u03b1j c j + \u3008ib\u03b1i b\u03b1j \u3009 \u00d7\u2212icic j + . . . etc, resulting in an effective mean-field Hamiltonian, which is subsequently solved in a straightforward manner. The averages\nm\u03b1A = \u2329 ib\u03b1i ci \u232a , m\u03b1B = \u2329 ib\u03b1j c j \u232a , (6)\nw\u03b3 = \u3008\u2212icic j\u3009\u03b3 , \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = \u2329 ib\u03b1i b \u03b2 j \u232a \u03b3 , (7)\nare treated as the mean-field parameters with respect to (w.r.t.) which the total energy Etot will eventually be minimized. Here A, B are the honeycomb sublattice labels, and the subscripts \u03b3 indicate the bonds over which the averages are taken. We\n043024-3\ndemand \u2202Etot \u2202\u03bb\u03b1 = 0 from which a set of self-consistency equations follows.\nSome comments are in order. If the averages corresponding to products of Majorana fermions on different sites, such as the bond operators \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 are dropped or found to vanish, then the spins in the resulting state can be treated entirely as classical. On the other hand, if all averages on the same site such as m\u03b1i vanish, the result is analogous to Ref. [1], where the spins are completely fractionalized. In particular, for the pure Kitaev Hamiltonian in zero field, the absolute value of xxx \u2261 X attains its maximum possible value of 1, and similarly for x \u2192 y or z. We shall say in this case that the spins are \u201cmaximally fractionalized\u201d. In general, the values of X,Y , and Z thus describe the degree of fractionalization of the spins; they vanish in the classical limit. In this limit, the resulting effective Hamiltonian for the Majorana fermions is entirely local, and the Majorana bands have zero Chern numbers. In this respect, we emphasize that this mean-field method captures the quantum character of the model via the parameters X,Y, Z , and w\u03b3 ."

            "text": "We start with the ferromagnetic Kitaev model (K < 0), which has been extensively studied in the literature before [58,81]. We calculate the Chern number map in Fig. 2 for magnetic fields in the a \u2212 c plane. The Chern numbers are calculated numerically following Ref. [82]. The radial axis in the selected directions mark the field strengths, h =\u221a\nh21 + h22 + h23 and hi = h \u00b7 e\u0302i. The upper half (h1 \u2212 h3) plane is sufficient because reversing the field direction simply changes the sign of the Chern number [83].\nIn zero field, the KSL ground state is gapless. At small field strengths 0 < h 1, the fermionic vacuum becomes topologically nontrivial [1] with \u03bd = \u00b11 [84]. The odd val-\nued Chern numbers indicate the presence of non-Abelian anyons [1] whereas even valued Chern numbers imply the presence of Abelian anyons. At higher fields beyond hFc \u2248 0.18|K|, the system turns into a polarized, topologically trivial phase. The obtained sequence of states as a function of the magnetic field strength reproduces the previous result in Ref. [81]. In addition, there is an overall sign reversal (e.g., \u03bd = 1 \u2192 \u22121) upon crossing the \u03b8 \u2248 35o line in the h1 \u2212 h3 plane [1,58]. Beware that the angle \u03b8 is defined w.r.t. the h3 axis (clock-wise), e.g., positive angle means positive h1 value. The sign change in \u03bd can be naturally understood by a sign change of any magnetic field component (in this case hz), because the Chern number is proportional to the sign of the energy gap created by the product of the magnetic field components, \u03bd \u223c sgn(hxhyhz ). Using the transpose of Eq. (2), the critical line (in the upper h1 \u2212 h3 plane) is identified by the angle where hz changes sign, this is when \u2212 \u221a 2h1 + h3 = 0 or \u03b8c = tan\u22121( h1h3 ) 180\u03c0 = 35o is satisfied. The same sign changes apply to the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model as well.\nOur approach captures all the qualitative properties of the field response for the F Kitaev model reported in the literature. On the quantitative side, the critical field strength for the transition to the polarized phase is found to be larger (hMFc = 0.18|K|) than the exact diagonalization results (hEDc = 0.03 |K|) [58]. The latter result is more realistic because the current MF method neglects not only the additional correlations that cannot be described by a single particle wavefunctions but also the site dependent fluctuations of the constraint field (\u03bb\u03b1i ), which is strictly necessary to ensure a faithful representation of the spins as composite Majorana fermions. Hence, this drawback results in a larger window of stability for a spin liquid phase."

            "text": "The antiferromagnetic Kitaev model is examined in two steps within the upper half of the h1 \u2212 h3 plane. The phase diagram is substantially different from K < 0 case. As noted before in [59,64], this can be understood as due to the difference in effective magnetic fields acting on the spins [59,64]. We first obtain the Chern number map as shown in Fig. 3.\n043024-4\nWe support this result by three additional results: The average magnetic moment |M| = |mA + mB|/2 [Fig. 4(a)], the energy gap Egap [Fig. 4(b)] and the mean-field Wilson loop expectation value on a honeycomb plaquette, \u3008W\u0302\u3009 = 26\u3008Sx1Sy2Sz3Sx4Sy5Sz6\u3009 [1] [Fig. 4(c)]. Note that the Wilson loop \u3008W\u0302\u3009 allows to quantify the existence of an emergent gauge field, which is the direct signature of fractionalization where the spins fractionalize into local gauge fields (X,Y , and Z) and itinerant Majorana fermions (ci). We calculate \u3008W\u0302\u3009 by a MF contraction \u3008W\u0302\u3009 \u2248 \u3008ib\u03b11b\u03b11\u3009\u3008\u2212icic j\u3009 + ..., where the indices i, j stands for the sublattices A and B, respectively. For a two-site unit cell, the MF correlations for the six sites forming the honeycomb plaquette are not independent, but \u3008W\u0302\u3009 \u2248 X 2Y 2Z2 where the c-type Majoranas have paired to unity, c2i = 1 [85]. We omit all contractions, which reflect local magnetic moments, e.g., \u223c \u3008ib\u03b1i ci\u3009 to capture the gauge flux only.\nWe first consider the overall quantitative response of the AF Kitaev model, as shown in Fig. 4. The KSL phase stabilized in the h \u2192 0 limit crosses through an intermediate region with increasing field strengths and ultimately reaches a polarized phase. As shown in Fig. 4(a), |M| gradually increases and saturates at high-fields along all magnetic field directions. In parallel, the Wilson flux \u3008W\u0302\u3009 [see Fig. 4(c)] decays with increasing field strength irrespective of the field orientation.\nWe first consider the evolution along the [111] (e\u03023) direction, where h1 = h2 = 0. The role of the field direction is clearly visible in the topological index of the GS, the Chern number, \u03bd in Fig. 3 (also see Appendix B and Fig. 8 for energy-band diagrams). The fermionic vacuum becomes topologically nontrivial (\u03bd = \u22121) and an energy gap opens proportional to hxhyhz/|K|3 [see the red-dashed curve on Fig. 4(b)]. At larger field strengths, there are two band touchings at h \u2248 0.7 |K| and 0.8 |K|. Hence, four topologically distinct phases are encountered as a function of the field strength with the Chern numbers: \u03bd = 0 \u2192 \u22121 \u2192 2 \u2192 0. At h \u2248 0.7 |K|, three additional Dirac cones are generated at the M points of the Brillouin zone, changing \u03bd by 3 units\n\u03bd = \u22121 \u2192 2, with a noteworthy difference to Ref. [86] where the change is again in 3 units yet \u03bd = \u22121 \u2192 \u22124 (w.r.t the Chern number sign convention of this paper). A scenario with a Chern number transfer of 3 is possible with an equal number of Dirac cones to be involved in this transition where each Dirac cone can transfer at most one unit of Chern number [87] via gap closure and reopening. The resulting even valued Chern number phase is supposed to have Abelian anyons [1]. In the high-field limit, eventually two Dirac cones annihilate each other (at gamma point) at h \u2248 0.8 |K|, resulting in \u03bd from 2 to 0 with a polarized phase. The region with \u03bd = 2 is extended to the h1 = 0 region as well as the corresponding finite energy gap in Fig. 4(b). The topological GS with a Chern number \u03bd = 2 has also been identified in Refs. [62,88] but both these references have confined themselves only to [111]. It has been asserted that this phase supports multiple Abelian anyonic species [88]. The conjectured \u201cmultispecies anyon\u201d region extends mainly to positive \u03b8 angles as seen in Fig. 3. Along the negative \u03b8 direction, the \u03bd = 2 region is replaced by a phase with \u03bd = 1. These phases and others are also identified by the Egap map in Fig. 4(b).\nThe [001] field direction has already been investigated first in [60,81]. It was suggested that the ground state remains a gapless spin liquid until it reaches the field-polarized phase. The results of Nasu et al. [60] relied on a mean-field decoupling between \u201cchains\u201d of Wigner-Jordan strings, while Hickey and Trebst [81] employed numerical diagonalization of a small system. Similarly, we observe consecutive opening and closure of the energy gap in attenuating fashion until h \u2248 0.7 |K| with the Chern number \u03bd = 1 [see the green curve on Fig. 4(b)]. Interestingly, \u03bd does not change sign until h 0.7 |K| and then it becomes \u03bd = \u22121 for 0.7 < h/|K| < 0.8. At h \u2248 0.8 |K|, the system enters a trivial phase with a vanishing Chern number. In this respect, our MF approach provides a different field evolution along the [001] direction as compared to the literature.\nAn interesting transition occurs upon sweeping the magnetic field direction between the [001] and [111] directions (see Fig. 3) for two magnetic field strength limits. At high\n043024-5\nfield strengths, [001] and [111] directions are adiabatically connected with \u03bd = 0. Yet, at lower fields, the two directions are topologically distinct as [001] direction yields a gapless state [60,81]. We observe that the states in the vicinity of the [001] direction are topologically equivalent to the [111] direction with an energy gap and the same Chern number \u03bd = \u22121 in contrast to \u03b8 = 35o where there is a topological transition. This transition was not noted before.\nBefore closing this section, we comment on the field directions \u03b8 = \u00b160o and \u03b8 = \u00b190o typically explored in experiments [57,58]. The experimentally accessible fields up to 50 Tesla allow \u03b1-RuCl3 to cross all the phase boundaries. We therefore indicate the \u03b8 = \u00b160o directions with red arrows in Figs. 2 and 3, whereas \u03b8 = \u00b190o refers to the h1 axis. It is clear that the field orientation dependence of \u03baxy could be used to trace a AF type Kitaev term in real materials keeping in mind the material specific additional couplings. The change in \u03baxy is expected to be in integer multiplies of 1/2 in units of \u03c06 k 2 BT [1]. Moreover, the topological transitions are accompanied by sign changes in \u03baxy before the system reaches the high-field polarized phase."

The relevant terms are the off-diagonal exchange term is , p as well as the Heisenberg coupling J . In the following, we consider less-frequently studied and p terms [65\u201367,89\u201393], as they are sufficient to capture the ZZ-\u03b3 phase. The Hamiltonian for the additional terms is\nH , p = \u03b1\u2212bond\u2211 \u3008i j\u3009,\u03b2\u03b3 | \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 |[ S\u03b2i S\u03b3j + p(S\u03b1i S\u03b2j + S\u03b1i S\u03b3j )].

For convenience, we partially relax the restriction on , p to characterize the GS in a larger parameter space for positive and negative p values.\nInspired by \u03b1-RuCl3, we investigate the GS phase diagram for the K- - p model again within the mean-field theory scheme.

Clearly, the bond operators ib\u03b3i b \u03b3 j on the \u03b3 bond, which commute with the pure Kitaev Hamiltonian are no longer constants of motion when and p are nonzero.\nThe mean-field equations for the total Hamiltonian HK p = HK + H p \u2212 H\u03bb are solved for a four-site unit cell (see the green dashed rectangle in Fig. 1) so as to capture the relevant phases such as the ZZ-\u03b3 phase. In limiting to only four-site unit cells, we have also excluded states with larger unit cells [73] or incommensurate [39] order. At this point, it is underlined that we have limited our investigations to the ZZ phases to be ZZ-z only. It is known [44] that different zigzag phases can be favored under external fields, depending on the field directions. The energetic competition between these states is delicate and we prefer to leave that investigation to future work.\nWe fix the Kitaev coupling to be of ferromagnetic type (K < 0) and examine the phase diagram in - p space in the zero field. Figures 5(a)\u20135(d) show the average magnetic moment (|M| = |\u22114i=1 mi|/4 where the index i extends over the four-site unit cell), the staggered magnetic moment (|Mstag| = |m1 + m2 \u2212 m3 \u2212 m4|/4), the Wilson flux and the energy gap ( Egap), respectively. The parameters and p cover of only the experimentally relevant ranges for \u03b1-RuCl3 with \u2208 [0, 0.62] and p \u2208 [\u22120.3, 0] in units of |K|. We identify four different phases, which are characterized below: KSL, K SL, F, and the ZZ-z phases. The F [73] and the ZZ-z phase are distinguished by the directions of the magnetic moments as well as by the vanishing Wilson flux [Fig. 5(c)] and the finite energy gap [Fig. 5(d)]. KSL and K SL phases have zero magnetic moments and gapless structure ( Egap = 0) and differ only in their average Wilson loop. Yet, the curve separating KSL phase and K SL phase should not be considered as a sharp boundary because the average Wilson flux is neither 1 or 0 but has a decaying form. The characteristic directions of the magnetic moments for each phase as summarized in Fig. 6(e).\nFocusing on Fig. 5(a) first, there is an extended KSL region for small | p| values. With increasing values, there is a smooth crossover to a phase referred to as K SL [65,90]. It is also a gapless phase with zero Wilson flux average W . For the region where < 0.3|K| and p < \u22120.15|K|, a ferromagnetic phase emerges. This phase can be understood by considering the spins as classical vectors for each sublattice, e.g., S\u03b1A = sin \u03b8A cos \u03c6Ax\u0302 + sin \u03b8A sin \u03c6Ay\u0302 + cos \u03b8Az\u0302. Exploiting translational invariance, the energy (per unit cell) then reads"

It is a gapped, topologically trivial and magnetically ordered phase [94]. The average magnetization |M| vanishes while the staggered magnetization is saturated\n043024-6\n|Mstag| = 1. For a four-site unit cell, the ZZ-z region is extended to larger and p magnitudes. |Mstag| has thus the same value as one would find by assuming from the outset that the magnetic moments are purely classical instead of quantum mechanical. Though our method should be capable in capturing quantum mechanical spin fluctuations and hence a ZZ-z phase with |Mstag| < 1 is in principle allowed, such a phase is not realized within the employed mean-field scheme."

            "text": "In this section, we explore on the magnetic field response of the K- - p model in \u2212 h space for the smallest value p = \u22120.17|K|, which stabilizes an experimentally relevant ZZ-z phase.\nAt zero field and with increasing , there are four phases encountered: The P phase, the KSL phase, the K SL phase and the ZZ-z phase. We first orient the magnetic field along the experimentally often studied direction with \u03b8 = 60o in the ac plane [57]. In Fig. 6, we present the phase diagram in which PF denotes a partially fractionalized phase. All the identified phases in \u2212 h space, shown in Fig. 6(a), are also illustrated with their local moment vectors in Fig. 6(e).\nThe P phase in which the magnetization points along the [111] (\u03b8 = 0o) direction for small values was made evident already by the classical spin argument in Eq. (11). It is the phase labeled by (3) in Fig. 6(e). A finite field with \u03b8 = 60o tilts the spins out of the [111] direction. A large enough field strength always takes the system into the P phase, although the\ncritical strength depends on the value of . Also, the direction of the spins lies between \u03b8 = 0o and \u03b8 = 60o.\nAt larger values for fixed p = \u22120.17|K|, the ferromagnetic phase is replaced by a KSL phase and it extends to larger field strengths. Because this region has a finite magnetization at any finite h, it can only be identified by a suppressed Wilson flux and a finite energy gap in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c), respectively. Depending on the strength of , KSL can undergo a phase transition to either the P phase or the ZZ-z phase. There is a small area within the ZZ-z phase with a suppressed Wilson flux in the vicinity of the KSL region where the K SL phase seems to be stabilized. It is then replaced by the ZZ-z phase at much smaller field strengths.\nMoreover, before the polarized phase, we indeed observe an intermediate phase with a reduced magnetic moment [see Fig. 6(a)], which we dubbed as the partially fractionalized (PF) phase. Even if it seems to be disconnected from the extended KSL region and has a vanishing Wilson flux [see Fig. 6(c)], this phase supports finite fractionalization. We plot the fractionalization order parameter \u221a X 2 + Y 2 + Z2, e.g., X = \u3008ibxjbxl \u3009x, [see Fig. 6(f)] showing that the total spin fractionalization is finite within the PF phase (see Fig. 9 for additional indicators along \u03b8 = \u221260o). It is a gapped phase [see Fig. 6(d)] and exists for a wide range of values.\nThe antisymmetrized thermal Hall conductivity \u03baAxy = (\u03baxy \u2212 \u03bayx )/2 is routinely measured in the THC experiments (see e.g., [57\u201359]). Near zero temperature, the linear T coefficient of \u03baAxy is proportional to the total Chern number \u03bd of the occupied fermionic bands. Hence, we now discuss \u03bd obtained in our mean-field theory for the K- - p model in\n043024-7\na magnetic field. Firstly, at h = 0 in Fig. 5, the ZZ-z phase is a collinear phase, which can be mapped back to itself by a time-reversal operator and a translation by a lattice vector. Naturally, it indicates a trivial Chern number. Within the PF phase, the system is connected with the P phase at high magnetic fields without a gap closure, it has \u03bd = 0 in spite of finite spin fractionalization. The linear T coefficient of \u03baAxy is thus expected to vanish, but a contribution from thermal excitations across the relatively small gap is possible. Also, for the P phase at large magnetic fields, the spins are polarized and the correlations between the Majorana fermions are completely local, giving only topologically trivial bands and hence also \u03bd = 0. We have numerically verified \u03bd = 0 for the ZZ-z phase and the P phase.\nWe now extend the analysis of the K- - p model to arbitrary field directions. The absolute magnetization in arbitrary magnetic field (in the a-c plane) is shown in Fig. 7, where Mabs = 14 \u22114 i=1 |mi|. We set the couplings as K < 0, = 0.5|K|, p = \u22120.17|K| such that the GS is the ZZ-z phase. The radial direction is the magnetic field strength and \u03b8 is the polar angle w.r.t. the c axis. The ZZ-z phase is stable for small field strengths in all directions. The field extended ZZ-z phase is also seen in other studies [44,73], if is comparable to the Kitaev coupling. It is known [44] that the ZZ-z phase is more stable to out-of-plane magnetic field, since the spins can tilt more easily towards the field direction. For < |K|, Mstag\ntends to a more acute angle with the x \u2212 y plane (\u03b8 = 35o), with a small out-of-plane z component. In the presence of a magnetic field pointing closer to the z direction (\u03b8 = \u221255o), the ZZ-z phase is hence more stable in comparison to the field directions within the x-y plane (\u03b8 = 35o). In this regard, the THC experiment on \u03b1-RuCl3 has revealed that the magnetic field responses for \u03b8 = \u00b160o directions are not symmetrical but the system has a wider intermediate region for \u03b8 = +60o [58]. We indeed verify a wider intermediate region (less stable ZZ-z phase) for \u03b8 = 60o compared to \u221260o. On the contrary, for the field directions closer to the x-y plane (\u03b8 is around 35o or \u2212150o), the ZZ-z phase is highly unstable and paves the way for the intermediate PF phase. Because the magnetic field is not along [111], the rotational symmetry is already broken and we therefore cannot address the nematic phases reported in literature [73]."

            "text": "We developed a Majorana mean-field theory for complicated Kitaev materials. It holds a good basis for the investigation of expensive Hamiltonians to hunt for spin liquids to complement time and resource consuming numerical approaches within large parameter spaces. One such model that a MF Majorana theory is applied [95] is the\n043024-8\ntwo-dimensional J1-J2 Heisenberg model, which could have applicability to cuprates.\nWe sum up this work by referring back to the initially posed questions. Regarding the phase diagram of the AF Kitaev model in a magnetic field: We identified an additional topologically nontrivial ground state with Abelian anyons (even\nChern number \u03bd = \u00b12) in addition to the \u03bd = \u00b11 vacuum mainly referred to in the literature as the source of the halfquantized THC. The magnetic field response is sensitive to the magnetic field orientation and strength upon, which several topological transitions are encountered for fields in the a-c plane. We emphasize that the gapless phases are hard to trace and demand for special numerical care (e.g., for fields in the [001] direction).\nRegarding the role of the additional off-diagonal - p terms in the modeling of real materials, we have shown that the pure Kitaev picture changes dramatically for comparable strength of \u223c |K| in favor of a K SL as the gauge-flux expectation value per plaquette vanishes, W = 0. At finite p and not too small , the zigzag phase emerges. At a finite magnetic field, the K SL phase gave way to the zigzag phase. Starting from these phases at zero field, a magnetic field of suitable strength is able to drive the system towards partial spin fractionalization. The latter phase however is different from the Kitaev spin liquid as indicated by the Wilson flux. Further investigation of the properties of this phase with partial fractionalization region is left to the future.\nComparing our results with the theoretical results readily available in the literature, we not only found a qualitatively satisfying agreement for all limits of K, , p, and h but we made two important contributions, the topologically distinct sectors of the pure AF Kitaev model in different magnetic field orientations and the coexistence of magnetic moments and fractionalization dubbed as the PF phase for K- - p-h model. Additionally, our findings also capture the asymmetry in the magnetic field response measurements in Ref. [58] for \u03b8 = \u00b160o magnetic field orientations in a straightforward way.\nIt is worth talking about typical magnetic field strengths and the relevance of the numbers obtained in this paper to experiments. In Fig. 6, the magnetic field direction along \u03b8 = 60o, the PF phase is stabilized mainly for h \u2208 [0.05, 0.12] (in units of |K|). Matching the energy scales for the Kitaev\n043024-9\ncoupling and the magnetic field coupling term, h \u00b7 S = K , one can get a rough estimate on the magnetic field scale. 0.05kB|K| BgJ\u03bcB jeff 0.12|K| yields a window for the magnetic field strength B \u2208 [4, 9.4] T. Note that Kitaev coupling is estimated to be roughly 100K [96]. Also, jeff = S = 1/2, kB is the Boltzmann constant, \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton and gJ \u2248 2 is the Lande factor for jeff . In Fig. 7, the width of PF phase is varying as a function of magnetic field direction. The critical field for melting the ZZ-z phase can go up to 16+ Tesla for [111] direction and even larger for small and negative \u03b8 values. These findings are verified with the literature [96] (and references therein such as Ref. [97]) and show that the Majorana MF theory predicts sensible results.\nThis paper raises several questions to be addressed in a next step as a natural extension, in particular about the character of the intermediate phase. A detailed study of the nature of the excitations of this partially fractionalized phase could provide valuable information relevant for spectroscopic signatures. Aside from the current materials of interest, there is an extended region [98] with > 0 and p > 0 in spin liquid phases are stabilized. Actually, preliminary results premise an even larger extended region of stabilized KSL phase for < 0 and p > 0. Even an additional region stabilizing a ZZ-z phase in \u2212 p space is possible, which could potentially provide an alternative materials scenario. A finite temperature response of the K \u2212 \u2212 p model in arbitrary magnetic field is indispensable for conclusions with regards to thermal Hall conductivity experiments. Thermodynamical functions need to be calculated for a wide regime of K \u2212 \u2212 p \u2212 h \u2212 T parameters. Additionally, we aim at analytical evaluations for the thermodynamics of the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model in a [001] magnetic field with closed form expressions in leading orders of h and T . And it has to be explored how our conceptually simple and comprehensive formalism can be applied to comply with the recently observed oscillations [59] in the longitudinal thermal conductivity as a function of the inverse magnetic field."

However, this approach is not very useful for arbitrary field directions where one has to deal with Pauli strings [60]. We therefore stick to Kitaev\u2019s original representation [1]. Accordingly, each spin is represented by two Majorana fermions\u2014as real fermionic field. Consider the following mapping (with h\u0304 = 1):\n2S\u03c1j = \u03c3\u03c1j = ib\u03c1j c j, \u03c1 \u2208 {x, y, z}, (A1) { b\u03c1i , b \u03b8 j\n} = 2\u03b4\u03c1,\u03b8 \u03b4i, j, {b\u03c1i , c j} = 0, (A2) ( b\u03c1i\n)2 = c2i = 1. (A3) Each spin component is thus a composite object consisting of two Majorana fermions. However, the size of the Hilbert space is thereby doubled and it is required to impose the following quartic constraint at each site to ensure the equivalence and the reality of each vector in the enlarged Hilbert space,\nD\u0302 j = bxjbyjbzjc j = 1. (A4) In the new representation the Kitaev Hamiltonian is written as\nHK = 1 4 \u2211 jl,\u03c1\u2212bond K\u03c1b\u03c1j b \u03c1 l c jcl . (A5)\nThe spectral decomposition of HK is obtained by using the constants of motion, the bond operators u\u0302\u03c1jl \u2261 ib\u03c1j b\u03c1l , [HK , u\u0302 \u03c1\njl ] = 0. In other words, each bond gauge field is a constant of motion and the Hilbert space can be segmented into the gauge sectors of each bond. Choosing all gauge-sector eigenvalues as u\u0302\u03c1jl = +1 for K\u03c1 > 0, the gauge fields are \u201cfrozen\u201d and decoupled from itinerant fermions. Then, the Hamiltonian becomes quadratic,\nHK = \u2212 i 4 \u2211 jl,\u03c1\u2212bond K\u03c1c jcl . (A6)\nThe itinerant fermion dispersion [1] is\n(q) = \u00b1|Kxeiq\u00b7rx + Kyeiq\u00b7ry + Kzeiq\u00b7rz |, (A7) which is identical to the graphene with Dirac cones when K\u03b1 = K . The bond vectors [in e\u03021, e\u03022, e\u03023 basis as shown in Eq. (2)] are rx = \u22122(2a1 \u2212 a2)/3, ry = \u22122(2a2 \u2212 a1)/3 and rz = (2a1 + a2)/3. The Bravais vectors of the honeycomb lattice are a1 = \u221a 3a 2 (1, \u221a 3) and a2 = \u221a 3a 2 (\u22121, \u221a 3) with a being the lattice constant. However, this approach is highly sensitive to proper gauge choices in each sector, therefore it is very limited for extensions to other interactions, which are readily present in real materials. Moreover, the additional emerging exchange couplings demand a more all-inclusive approach in which fractional and conventional magnetism can be treated on an equal footing. A mean-field decoupling of Majorana fermions [60\u201364,78\u201380] in this respect is a suitable method for two reasons: Firstly, a decoupling scheme provides the desired competition between the conventional and the anomalous pairings. Secondly, the main disadvantage of a typical mean-field (MF) method, i.e., the loss of correlations, is partially resolved because the fractionalized excitations are\n043024-10\nalready included through replacing the spin operators by composite Majorana operators.\nKitaev type spin-spin interaction has a quartic form in Majorana representation. The bond operators u\u0302\u03b1jl are not frozen in a more general setting, e.g., in the presence of the external field, additional off-diagonal spin-spin interactions. It is therefore more appropriate to decouple a general spin-spin interaction on an arbitrary bond \u03b7, e.g., S\u03c1j S \u03b8 l as follows:\n\u2212ib\u03c1j b\u03b8l ic jcl \u2248 \u2329 ib\u03c1j c j \u232a ib\u03b8l cl + ib\u03c1j c j \u2329 ib\u03b8l cl \u232a \u2212 \u2329ib\u03c1j c j \u232a\u2329ib\u03b8l cl \u232a \u2212 \u2329ib\u03c1j b\u03b8l \u232aic jcl + ib\u03c1j b\u03b8l \u2329 \u2212 ic jcl \u232a \u2212 \u2329b\u03c1j b\u03b8l \u232a\u2329 \u2212 ic jcl \u232a\n\u2261 m\u03c1Aib\u03b8l cl + m\u03c1Bib\u03b8j c j \u2212 m\u03c1Am\u03b8B \u2212 \u03c1\u03b8\u03b7 ic jcl +w\u03b7ib\u03c1j b\u03b8l \u2212 \u03c1\u03b8\u03b7 w\u03b7. (A8)\nAssuming isotropic bond strengths, K\u03b1 = K , the MF decoupled magnetic Kitaev mean-field Hamiltonian reads\nHK = K 4 \u2211 jl,\u03c1\u2212bond ( m\u03c1A \u2212 2h\u03c1 K ) ib\u03b1l cl + ( m\u03c1B \u2212 2h\u03c1 K ) ib\u03c1j c j\n\u2212 \u03c1\u03c1\u03c1 ic jcl + w\u03c1 ib\u03c1j b\u03c1l \u2212 m\u03c1Am\u03c1B \u2212 \u03c1\u03c1\u03c1 w\u03c1. (A9) Corresponding MF parameters are\nm\u03c1A = \u2329 ib\u03c1j c j \u232a , m\u03c1B = \u2329 ib\u03c1l cl \u232a , (A10)\nw\u03c1 = \u2212 \u2329 ic jcl \u232a \u03c1 , \u03c1\u03b8\u03b7 = \u2329 ib\u03c1j b \u03b8 l \u232a \u03b7 . (A11)\nNote that m\u03c1A,B are components of the local magnetic moments on sublattices A and B whereas w\u03b7 = w is the same on all bonds. \u03c1\u03b8\u03b7 are the indicators of fractionalization defined on the bond \u03b7. For simplicity, we use shorthand notations for \u03b7\u03b7\u03b7 , e.g., xx x = X . While the aim is to obtain a quadratic Hamiltonian, there is an issue regarding the quartic constraint on Majorana fermions. The strategy is to rewrite the constraint in terms of two-fermion operators. Multiplying both sides with any two of the four fermion operators, one can rewrite the single quartic constraint in Eq. (A4) as three quadratic constraint relations,\nbzc + bxby = 0, (A12)\nbxc + bybz = 0, (A13)\nbyc + bzbx = 0, (A14) where the site index is dropped for simplicity. Based on these relations, the constraints can be introduced into the Hamiltonian with three Lagrange multipliers,\nHMF = HK \u2212 H\u03bb, H\u03bb = i 2 \u03c1,\u03b8,\u03b7\u2208{x,y,z}\u2211 j \u03bb\u03c1 ( b\u03c1j c j + \u03c1\u03b8\u03b7 2 b\u03b8j b \u03b7 j ) ,\n(A15)\nwhere we omitted any spatial dependence of \u03bb\u03c1i = \u03bb\u03c1 . The constrained mean-field Hamiltonian must satisfy the saddle point condition\n\u2202\u3008HMF\u3009 \u2202\u03bb\u03c1 = \u2202Etot (\u03bb) \u2202\u03bb\u03c1 = 0, (A16)\nwhich is equivalent to the quadratic constraints to hold for expectation values,\n\u3008ibzc\u3009 = \u2212\u3008ibxby\u3009, (A17)\n\u3008ibxc\u3009 = \u2212\u3008ibybz\u3009, (A18)\n\u3008ibyc\u3009 = \u2212\u3008ibzbx\u3009. (A19)\nFor the evaluation of \u3008HMF\u3009 we consider the general Hamiltonian (H) of the form\nH = \u2212i \u2211 j\u03b1,l\u03b2 j\u03b1,l\u03b2c j\u03b1cl\u03b2 (A20)\non a periodic lattice. Here c j\u03b1 operators, unlike c j , includes all types of Majorana fermions (bx, by, bz, c). j, l labels are unit cells indices for sublattices A and B, respectively. The sub-indices \u03b1, \u03b2 represent the Majorana flavors (e.g., c j,{\u22124,\u22123,\u22122,\u22121} \u2208 {bxj, byj, bzj, c j} and c j,{1,2,3,4} \u2208 {bxl , byl , bzl , cl}) within the corresponding sublattices. j\u03b1,l\u03b2 is necessarily anti-symmetric under the interchange j\u03b1 \u2194 l\u03b2. This Hamiltonian can be diagonalized using the transformation\nc j\u03b1 = \u221a 2 \u2211 q,\u03bb u j\u03b1,q,\u03bb\u03b1q,\u03bb (A21)\nwhere \u221a\n2 is used to ensure the correct factor in the anticommutation relations. The coefficients uj\u03b1,q,\u03bb satisfy the eigenvalue equation,\nEq,\u03bbu j\u03b1,q,\u03bb = \u2212i j\u03b1,l\u03b2ul\u03b2,q,\u03bb. (A22)\nq labels the wavevector and \u03bb \u2208 {\u00b14,\u00b13,\u00b12,\u00b11} labels eight different solutions at each q. The eigenvectors imply a plane-wave form\nu j\u03b1,q,\u03bb = 1\u221a N eiq\u00b7r j u\u0303\u03b1\u03bb(q). (A23)\nHere, N is the number of unit cells, r j is the position vector of the sublattice A site j, and r j = j1a1 + j2a2. For convenience we choose \u2211 \u03b1 |u\u0303\u03b1\u03bb(q)|2 = 1. Equations (A20) and (A21) imply that the operators \u03b1q,\u03bb satisfy the commutation relation\n[\u03b1q,\u03bb, H] = Eq,\u03bb\u03b1q,\u03bb. (A24)\nExplicitly, \u03b1q,\u03bb = 1\u221a2 \u2211 j,\u03b1 u \u2217 j\u03b1,q,\u03bbc j\u03b1 can be derived from Eq. (A20). Equation (A21) transforms H into\nH = 1 2 \u2211 q,\u03bb Eq,\u03bb\u03b1 \u2020 q,\u03bb\u03b1q,\u03bb. (A25)\nTaking the complex conjugate of Eq. (A22) tells that the eigenvalues come in pairs: If ul\u03b1,q,\u03bb is a solution with eigenenergy Eq,\u03bb, then ul\u03b1,\u2212q,\u2212\u03bb = u\u2217l\u03b1,q,\u03bb (belonging to wavevector\u2212q) has eigenenergy \u2212Eq,\u03bb, and the associated operator \u03b1\u2212q,\u2212\u03bb is equivalent to \u03b1\u2020q,\u03bb. Rewriting the diagonalized Hamiltonian in Eq. (A25) in terms of positive energy oper-\n043024-11\nators only, we obtain\nH = 1 2 Eq,\u03bb>0\u2211 q,\u03bb [Eq,\u03bb\u03b1 \u2020 q,\u03bb\u03b1q,\u03bb \u2212 Eq,\u03bb\u03b1q,\u03bb\u03b1\u2020q,\u03bb]\n= Eq,\u03bb>0\u2211\nq,\u03bb\nEq,\u03bb\u03b1 \u2020 q,\u03bb\u03b1q,\u03bb \u2212\n1\n2 Eq,\u03bb>0\u2211 q,\u03bb Eq,\u03bb (A26)\nwhere the sums extend over only the positive energy eigenstates. \u03b1q,\u03bb operators satisfy the usual anticommutation relations {\u03b1q,\u03bb1 , \u03b1\u2020q\u2032,\u03bb2} = \u03b4q,q\u2032\u03b4\u03bb1,\u03bb2 . The ground state, therefore, is defined as \u03b1q,1|GS\u3009 = 0. This representation is useful for finite temperature extensions.\nSpecifically for this paper, j\u03b1,l\u03b2 corresponds to the meanfield parameters in Eq. (A10) and Eq. (A11) entering the mean-field Hamiltonian HMF in Eq. (A9). The Hamiltonian has an 8 \u00d7 8 matrix representation Hq in momentum space. Our convention is\nHMF = \u2211\nq\n\u2020qHq q, (A27)\nwhere q = (bxq, byq, bzq, cq, b\u0304xq, b\u0304yq, b\u0304zq, c\u0304q) indicates the Fourier transformed Majorana operators. The momentum space operators with(out) a bar on top belong to the sublattice-B (A), e.g., b\u03b1l \u2194 b\u0304\u03b1q (b\u03b1j \u2194 b\u03b1q). Yet, we generalize this convention to cq\u03b1 operators where each operator in q is represented by \u03b1 index, where \u03b1 \u2208 {\u00b14,\u00b13,\u00b12,\u00b11}. Hq can be diagonalized as \u2020qHq q = Dq where the matrix q has the form\nq = (|q,\u22124\u3009...|q,\u22121\u3009|q, 1\u3009...|q, 4\u3009). (A28) |q, \u03bb\u3009 = \u03b1\u2020q,\u03bb|0\u3009 denotes 8-component vectors where uj\u03b1,q\u03bb =\u3008 j\u03b1|q, \u03bb\u3009. Thereby the matrix elements of q are u\u0303\u03b1\u03bb(q) in Eq. (A23) with \u03b1, \u03bb being the entries for rows and columns, respectively.\nThe mean-field analysis is concluded by the selfconsistency relations for the MF parameters. For bond correlations, self-consistency requires\n\u3008ic j\u03b1cl\u03b2\u3009 = 2i N Eq,\u03bb>0\u2211 q,\u03bb eiq\u00b7r\u03b3 u\u0303\u03b1\u03bb(q)u\u0303\u2217\u03b2\u03bb(q), (A29)\nwhere the site indices j, l determine the bond direction r\u03b3 = r j \u2212 rl . The self-consistency cycle is completed via the dependence of u\u0303\u03b1\u03bb(q) on the MF parameters.\nThe values of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 for each MF parameters are provided below. Regarding the bond correlations,\nX \u2192 \u03b1 = \u22124, \u03b2 = 1, \u03b3 = x, Y \u2192 \u03b1 = \u22123, \u03b2 = 2, \u03b3 = y, Z \u2192 \u03b1 = \u22122, \u03b2 = 3, \u03b3 = z,\nw\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b1 = \u22121, \u03b2 = 4, \u03b3 \u2208 {x, y, z} with a \u201c\u2013\u201d sign Regarding the local correlations (e.g., magnetic moments),\n\u3008ic j\u03b1c j\u03b2\u3009 = 2i N Eq,\u03bb>0\u2211 q,\u03bb u\u0303\u03b1\u03bb(q)u\u0303\u2217\u03b2\u03bb(q). (A30)\nThe parameters are defined as\nmxA \u2192 \u03b1 = \u22124, \u03b2 = \u22121, mxB \u2192 \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 4, myA \u2192 \u03b1 = \u22123, \u03b2 = \u22121, myB \u2192 \u03b1 = 2, \u03b2 = 4, mzA \u2192 \u03b1 = \u22122, \u03b2 = \u22121, mzB \u2192 \u03b1 = 3, \u03b2 = 4.\nThe remaining MF parameters [e.g., in Eq. (A17)] can be handled with a similar straightforward approach.\nWe used a two-site unit cell for pure Kitaev models under a magnetic field whereas a four-site unit cell for K- - p model in a crystal. The Bravais lattice vectors for a two-site unit cell, a1, a2 are shown below Eq. (A7) and the four-site unit-cell vectors a\u03031, a\u03032 are chosen as a\u03031 = a1 \u2212 a2 and a\u03032 = a1 + a2. Regarding the four-site unit cell, it can be argued if the BZ backfolding in a reduced BZ poses a problem for a ground state with a two-site periodicity due to the redundant energy level crossings at the BZ boundary. Yet, it is a well-known fact that the energy level crossings in the reciprocal space does not have a topological origin and the energy eigenstates are equivalent compared to the case where there is no back-folding in a two-site unit cell. The Brillouin zone integrals are approximated as 10000+ meshpoint sums for the Brillouin zone,\u222b\nBZ d 2k \u2248 \u2211i( k)i. The Chern number for a two-site unit cell is calculated [82] for a simpler rhombic Brillouin zone choice. It is because the Wilson loops at the boundaries of the BZ could pose problems due to the complicated periodicity of the honeycomb shaped BZ. Moreover, one has the freedom to choose any set of unique q points in the reciprocal space as the basis vectors. The initial configurations for the MF parameters as well as the Lagrange multipliers are set to various distinct values such that the minimization procedure can capture all possible phases, e.g., P, ZZ-z, PF and spin liquid phases. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration satisfying convergence conditions w.r.t the MF parameters and their total mean squared error threshold in the gradient descent scheme. The threshold is 10\u22126 for stable regions, 10\u22124 for the phase boundaries with stronger variations in MF parameters. We also checked the performance of the mean-field method in magnetic fields. Neither the magnetic field strength nor the magnetic field angle changes the performance of the meanfield method."
