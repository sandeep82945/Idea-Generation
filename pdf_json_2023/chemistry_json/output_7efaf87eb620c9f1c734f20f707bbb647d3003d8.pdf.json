While the use of rare earth catalysts for the hydroboration of C]X bonds has been on the rise, there has been limited mechanistic information which would provide valuable insight into reaction pathways and their potential manipulation in this emerging eld.45\u201349 Quantum chemical studies of these catalytic reaction mechanisms would provide a fundamental understanding of the structures and energetics in question,50\u201354 and offer a predictive model to accelerate catalyst design while forecasting reaction outcomes and potential deactivation pathways.55,56\nIn recent reports from this Laboratory, the rapid and selective hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones, esters, and amides was achieved using homoleptic lanthanide trisamido precatalysts Ln[N(SiMe3)2]3 (Ln\nNTMS) (TMS = SiMe3) and pinacolborane (HBpin) as the reducing agent (Fig. 1).42\u201344 In the case of esters and amides, kinetic, isotopic labeling, and preliminary theoretical studies were carried out to interrogate the reaction mechanisms (Fig. 1a and b). The DFT-derived mechanisms were in good agreement with the experimental observations. Interestingly, some of the key intermediate structures in the proposed mechanisms featured bidentate chelation of esters or amides with the lanthanide center. Note that such structural modes for aldehydes and ketones are rare.57 In the case of aldehydes and ketones, the room temperature hydroboration is signicantly faster than for esters and amides, with TOFs as high as 40 000 h\u22121 with catalyst loadings in the range of 0.01\u2013\n3248 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3247\u20133256\n1 mol%. In aldehyde/ketone competition studies, aldehydes invariably exhibit higher activity toward hydroboration.\nNote that mechanistic studies were not carried out on the aldehyde and ketone hydroborations, and the proposed mechanism(s) were necessarily speculative. Understanding the reaction pathways of these effective methodologies should provide valuable information for designing future lanthanide catalysts with enhanced activity toward even more challenging substrates. Furthermore, proposed transition states in the ester43 and amide44 hydroborations featured a ligand-assisted HBpin-centered hydride transfer which raised the question of whether similar ligand involvement was necessary in the aldehyde and ketone mechanisms. While this type of interaction is well-documented in heteroleptic organometallic catalysis with redox non-innocent ligands, the concept of chemically noninnocent ligands is just emerging within the homogeneous homoleptic catalytic research community.58\u201360\nIn regard to the catalytic cycle(s) for LaNTMS-mediated aldehyde and ketone hydroboration with HBpin, here we report the observation of multiple signicant intermediates and deactivated products which are characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Along with the results of relevant stoichiometric test reactions, these new insights expand the mechanistic understanding. Interestingly, one of the isolated solid complexes argues for the chemically noninnocent nature of the LnNTMS ligands. In addition, the DFT computed activation energetics for LaNTMS-mediated aldehyde, and ketone hydroborations are found to be in good agreement with the experimental kinetic data. Due to the lack of an additional substrate heteroatom to engage in bidentate La(III) chelation, it will be seen that these mechanisms differ from those previously identied in the deoxygenative reduction of amides and esters.43,44\nIn situ experimental mechanistic studies\nIn pioneering work, LaNTMS, the solid-state structure of which was recently published,61 was previously reported to catalyze the Tishchenko reaction, producing esters from the cross-coupling of aldehydes at TOFs < 100 h\u22121 (Scheme 1, path (a)),62,63 and as noted above, LaNTMS is also an efficient ester hydroboration catalyst (Fig. 1c).43 Thus, a possible reaction pathway, specic for aldehydes, might include initial catalytic coupling mediated by LaNTMS (Scheme 1, path (a)), and then, in the presence of HBpin, LaNTMS would mediate ester reduction to yield the hydroborated aldehyde (Scheme 1, step (b)). To test this hypothesis, benzaldehyde was rst reacted with 1 mol% of LaNTMS for 4 h at 25 \u00b0C, producing the benzyl benzoate Tishchenko product in 7.4% yield. In contrast, when 1 equiv. of HBpin is added to this reaction mixture (Scheme 1, step (b)) full conversion to the hydroborated product occurs within 1 h at 25 \u00b0C, while the Tishchenko product (benzyl benzoate) is still present (Fig. S37\u2020). Note that efficient reduction of the benzyl benzoate requires a temperature of 60 \u00b0C.43 Due to the rapidity of the aldehyde hydroboration (TOF \u223c2000 h\u22121),42 slow formation of the intermediate ester and subsequent HBpin reduction must therefore be a minor pathway.

In order to isolate and crystallize relevant structures and due to the very rapid reaction rates, we omitted some substrates from study (vide infra).\nLaNTMS reactions with benzophenone. When a ketone (benzophenone is used for ease of crystallization) is exposed to LaNTMS (Scheme 2, eqn (a)) the carbonyl oxygen coordinates to the La center and forms complex 1, which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2).

Interestingly, according to NMR spectroscopy, the subsequent reaction of LaNTMS with 2 yields a complex formulate as structure 3 in 28% yield (Scheme 2, eqn (c)). The 11B NMR spectrum of 3 reveals a 25.7 ppm signal downeld of that in hydroborated product 2 (d 22.9 ppm) by 2.86 ppm, presumably reecting the product coordinating to electrophilic La center. Furthermore, the proton on the ketyl carbon in 3 is shied upeld by 0.34 ppm to 5.98 ppm, presumably reecting the boxygen coordination to the Lewis acidic La center. These observations were augmented by 2D NMR experiments (Fig. S19 and S20\u2020), which reveal magnetically distinct proton signals from complexes 2 and 3 bound to the oxy-carbon atoms of their respective structures. The same effect is observed when comparing the aryl protons of benzophenone vs. complex 1 (see Fig. S1\u2020). Compound 3 is proposed to be an intermediate in the hydroboration of ketones (vide infra).\nLaNTMS reactions with benzaldehyde. In an attempt to ascertain whether intermediates analogous to complexes 1 and/ or 3 are involved in the aldehyde hydroborations, stoichiometric experiments were conducted with LaNTMS and benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde was used for ease of crystallization. Surprisingly, instead of an expected aldehyde\u2013La coordination complex,\nChem.

The structure of 4 is supported by 1D/2D NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallography. In the solid state, 4 crystallizes as a dimer (Fig. 3). The C(1)\u2013N(1) = 1.290(5) \u00c5, signicantly shorted than C\u2013N single bonds (\u223c1.47 \u00c5)64 and slightly longer than C]N double bonds (\u223c1.25 \u00c5).64 The plane containing O(1), C(1), N(1), and La(1) has a dihedral angle of only 8.69\u00b0. The La(1)\u2013N(1) distance is 2.591(3) \u00c5 which is signicantly longer than that of La(1)\u2013N(2), which is 2.370(3) \u00c5, suggesting N(1) has adopted more of an imino character compared to that of the amido N(2). Complex 4 is best described as a bidentate acylaminolate anion bound to La, and the structure is similar to several previously reported amido\u2013La complexes.65\u201367\nComplex 4 is presumably formed by the initial insertion of the aldehyde C]O bond into the LaNTMS N\u2013La bond to produce Intermediate 5 (Scheme 3, path (b)), which then undergoes rapid silane elimination to yield 4 (Scheme 3, step (c)). When HBpin is added to 4 (Scheme 3, step (d)), a complex mixture is obtained, which does not include the benzaldehyde (6) hydroboration product. Complex 4 is proposed to be a deactivated\n3250 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3247\u20133256\nproduct produced when aldehydes but not HBpin are present, and this scenario is supported by DFT calculations (vide infra). Note that higher catalyst loadings were reported to be necessary for some aldehydes,42 and the formation of this deactivated product could be the cause. An interesting observation from the chemistry shown in Scheme 3 is that the N(TMS)2 ligand is clearly non-innocent and is capable of interacting with the substrate while remaining coordinated to the La center. This will be a key feature in the proposed reaction mechanism (vide infra).\nLaNTMS reactions with HBpin. We next investigated the interaction of LaNTMS with HBpin. In initial work the NMR data for stoichiometric reactions of LaNTMS with excess HBpin suggested the possible formation of a zwitterionic deactivated product such as 7a (Scheme 4a, path (a)) by analogy to a similar Cp*2La-deactivated product characterized by NMR and X-ray diffraction23 (7b) (Scheme 4b).43 Here we isolated the LaNTMS + HBpin product and characterized it by multinuclear NMR and X-ray diffraction and suggest a plausible mechanism for its formation (Fig. S39\u2020). The new data require reassigning the tentative structure to that of dimeric complex 8 (Scheme 4a, path (b)). The new NMR data are quite similar to those initially reported43 and those of the Cp*2La-23complex. Note that 3 equiv. of HBpin are required to fully convert LaNTMS (Fig. S14\u2020). The solid-state structure of complex 8 can be described as a dimer with two La fragments bridged by alkoxide-like ligands. Each La ion is bound to a boronated pinacol alkoxy ligand, and two aminomonoboronate ligands coordinate to each La center in a k3-H fashion. The aminomonoboronate coordination is essentially linear as La(1)\u2013B(3)\u2013N(1) is 177.85\u00b0, similar to an analogous actinide structure.68\nNote that the pinacolato oxygen in the Bpin fragment of 8 is coordinated to the La ion. This is the second known structure featuring this type of coordination between Bpin and a lanthanide; the other structure is a polyoxometalate La catalyst synthesized from stoichiometric studies similar to those\nScheme 4 (a) Proposed structure of deactivated product 8 based on NMR (ref. 42) and analogy to a diffraction-derived deactivated product in ref. 23 (a) and revised, diffraction-derived structure from this work ((b) and Fig. 4).

The second pinacolato oxygen of 8 bridges the two La centers in an approximately equatorial plane, having a torsion angle of only 4.34\u00b0. Ligand insertion has been observed with similar rare earth silylamide complexes.76,77\nRegarding aminoboronate ligand utility, note that their felement complexes have gained relevance as potential chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition precursors, as ligands for the chemical separation of lanthanides,78 as volatile carriers for the use in brachytherapy,79 and for H2 storage.80 To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst isolated structure of an amino-mono-boronate lanthanide complex. When 8 is reacted with benzophenone or benzaldehyde, the corresponding hydroborated products 2 or 6 are not obtained (Scheme 5), suggesting that 8 is not involved in the catalysis but is rather a deactivated side product."

To validate the selected methodology, the structures of 1 and 4 were rst computed and compared to the experimental X-ray structures. In both cases, the computed data are in excellent agreement with the experiment (Tables S4 and S5\u2020).\nMechanism of catalytic ketone hydroboration\nIn the rst step, the ketone carbonyl oxygen coordinates to the La center to form complex A in a slightly exergonic step (DG = \u22122.6 kcal mol\u22121; step I in Fig. 5). The formation of A is supported by solution phase NMR spectroscopy and the solid-state\nScheme 5 Investigated catalytic reactions of benzophenone and benzaldehyde with complex 8, indicating negligible catalytic turnover.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nstructure of complex 1 (Fig. 2). In addition, complex 1 releases the hydroborated product when HBpin is present, further supporting the involvement in the hydroboration pathway. Next, HBpin interacts with the La\u2013N bond, yielding complex B (steps II and III). This step has a barrier of 16.9 kcal mol\u22121 (TS1) and is isoergonic by DG = \u22120.8 kcal mol\u22121. Note that the HBpin pinacolato oxygen coordinates to the acidic La center in a fashion similar to that in complex 8 (Fig. 4). Note also that the boron atom in B adopts a tetrahedral geometry with an additional N(TMS)2 ligand coordination. This yields a lanthanum center with a formal positive charge and boron with a formal negative charge. Next, the B\u2013H hydride atom migrates to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, yielding species C (steps IV and V), and reestablishing a neutral charge environment around the La as it loses coordination to an N(TMS)2 ligand (La\u2013N distance = 4.38 \u00c5). This latter step has a barrier of DG\u2021 = 18.6 kcal mol\u22121 (TS2) and is highly exergonic (DG = \u221229.0 kcal mol\u22121). While still coordinated to the La center, the bound pinB-N(TMS)2 moiety approaches the dicyclohexylmethoxide ligand, and an insertion into the La\u2013O bond follows, yielding intermediate D with new B\u2013O and La\u2013N bonds. This step has a barrier of 17.5 kcal mol\u22121 (TS3) and is endergonic (DG = 7.5 kcal mol\u22121) (steps VI and VII in Fig. 5).43,44 In the nal step, the hydroborated ketone is released from the catalyst (DG = \u22123.7 kcal mol\u22121), restoring the active LaNTMS catalyst (step VIII). The overall energetic span is 19.0 kcal mol\u22121 when considering C as the TDI species and TS2 as the TDTS species, in good agreement with the experiment. Moreover, a rst order in both HBpin and ketone is expected from the location of TDI and TDTS, in good agreement with the experiments.\nMechanism of catalytic aldehyde hydroboration\nNext, the aldehyde hydroboration mechanism was investigated (Fig. 6). In the rst step, the approach of aldehyde to the acidic LaNTMS center leads to complex E in a exergonic step (DG = \u22124.4 kcal mol\u22121; step IX, Fig. 6). This complex is reminiscent of species 5 hypothesized in Scheme 3 and it requires an energy barrier of 11.9 kcal mol\u22121 (not shown in Fig. 6). Once the substrate is coordinated to/activated by the La center, in a process similar to that in the ketone example, HBpin interacts\nChem.

Similar to the ketone mechanism, note the coordination of the pinacolato oxygen to the electrophilic La center, as seen in complex 8. The boron adopts a tetrahedral geometry with one N(TMS)2 ligand disassociating from the La center. Similar to the ketone pathway, the N(TMS)2 ligand is not innocent and creates a zwitterionic species with a formal positive charge on La and a formal negative charge on the boron atom. This process is isoergonic with a DG = \u22120.6 kcal mol\u22121. Next, the hydridic B/H\u2212 in F is delivered to the electrophilic carbonyl carbon yielding complex G which is the TDI of the proposed mechanism. This step has a barrier of 14.5 kcal mol\u22121 (TS5) and is highly exergonic by DG = \u221234.2 kcal mol\u22121 (G). Next, a metathesis-like step involves the pinB-N(TMS)2 group, which is not coordinated to the metal center (La\u2013N distance = 4.37 \u00c5), approaching the cyclohexanemethoxy ligand, forming complex H with a B\u2013O bond, and subsequently dissociating the B\u2013N bond. Complex H formation (steps XIV and XV) is endergonic (DG = 7.5 kcal mol\u22121) and is the turnover-\n3252 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3247\u20133256\ndetermining step of the cycle with a DG\u2021 = 17.6 kcal mol\u22121 (TS6, TDTS). Finally, the hydroborated aldehyde is released from the catalyst (DG = \u22122.9 kcal mol\u22121), restoring the active LaNTMS catalyst (step XVI). The overall energetic span is 17.6 kcal mol\u22121 and is in favorable agreement with the experiment. Moreover, a zero order in both HBpin and ketone is expected from the location of TDI and TDTS, in good agreement with the experiments.\nNext, the possible deactivation of the catalyst in the presence of aldehydes without HBpin was investigated. Aer initial aldehyde coordination to the La center (E), the H transfer between the aldehyde and a vicinal TMS group can occur, forming complex I (analogous to complex 4 in Scheme 3) with a computed barrier ofDG\u2021= 27.4 kcal mol\u22121 (Fig. 7). This step is exergonic (DG = \u221215.6 kcal mol\u22121). Note that this barrier is higher by 9.8 kcal mol\u22121 than when HBpin is present (Fig. 6, step XIV) and explains why, only when HBpin is absent or in not sufficient quantity, the catalysis could form complex 4. Despite the higher energetic barriers than when HBpin is present, this process of forming complex 4 from E could be the cause for the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "The hydroboration mechanisms for both ketones and aldehydes are found to be similar; however, they differ at the substrate coordination/activation step, which is more exothermic for ketones, while the turnover-determining step for ketones requires 1.4 kcal mol\u22121 more energy than the turnoverdetermining step for aldehydes. Thus, the overall energetic prole for dicyclohexyl ketone hydroboration lies at higher energy than that of the aldehydes likely due to the greater steric hindrance and decreased electrophilicity of the carbonyl associated with the ketone. The calculated rate-determining step is a H\u2212 transfer between HBpin and carbonyl group for the ketone and a s-bond metathesis step for aldehyde. In addition, the differences between the hydroboration of ketones and aldehydes to the reaction patterns of the LaNTMS catalyzed reductions of esters43 and amides44 can be summarized as: (1) the LaNTMS catalyst does not lose an NTMS ligand during the hydroboration of ketones and aldehydes, while it does during\nChem.

(2) While both classes of reduction involve a ligand-assisted mechanism, the former class involves a NTMS ligand already bound to the initial catalyst, while the amide reduction invokes participation of HBpin, a substrate molecule, in the ligand assisting step of the proposed mechanism. (3) Amides and esters can chelate to the lanthanide in a bidentate fashion, as in the proposed amide deoxygenation process, whereas ketones and aldehydes rarely engage in bidentate coordination and are not involved in their reduction process. Overall, the energetic span of the hydroboration of ketones and aldehydes is far lower compared to the energy of the LaNTMS-catalyzed reductions of esters43 and amides.44 Moreover, other homoleptic lanthanide catalytic processes have been theorized to involve a ligand-assisted mechanism in the hydroboration/reduction of aldehydes (Fig. 8).39,74,75 In Bao et al.'s DFT-computed mechanisms for the hydroboration of aldehydes using either a lanthanide-alkoxide or MeCp catalyst, the ligand-assisted pathway was found to be signicantly lower in energy than HBpin-Ln-coordinated carbonyl metathesis. Likewise, the experimental and theoretical data reported here support the chemical non-innocence of the amido ligands in the hydroboration of aldehydes and ketones."

            "text": "This study examined plausible reaction mechanisms for the rapid and selective LaNTMS-catalyzed hydroboration of ketones and aldehydes with HBpin. Several key intermediates and deactivated product structures were characterized via multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallography, and thereby provide detailed comparison and contrast of the ketone and aldehyde catalytic cycles. It is found vital that the carbonyl oxygen of the ketones and aldehydes binds to the Lewis acidic La center to initiate both pathways, and the structure of the ketone-coordinated La complex 1 supports this claim. Moreover, identifying the amido ligand interaction with the substrate in the bidentate acylaminato\u2013La complex 4 supports the catalytically important and chemically non-innocent nature of these \u2013N(TMS)2 ligands as they interact with the substrate while remaining coordinated to the catalytic metal center. Furthermore, the formation of complex 4 may be\n3254 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3247\u20133256\nthe origin of the higher required catalyst loadings and lower reaction rates observed for the hydroboration of aldehydes versus that of ketones. In addition, the rst aminomonoboronate bound to a lanthanide ion is reported (complex 8), which can alter hydridoborate chemistry in comparison to BH3-lanthanide complexes. This structure should inform the design of future aminomonoboronates and their potential applications. Finally, the DFT calculations identify ligandassisted hydroboration mechanisms that are in excellent agreement with experiment. These results further support the growing interest in lanthanide-organic amido catalysts and the chemical non-innocence of these important ligands."
