 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a similar analysis in other low and middle income countries to see if the results are consistent and generalizable. Expanding the research to other countries and contexts would strengthen the evidence base.

2. Do a more granular analysis of different food categories beyond just broad groups like fruits and vegetables. Look at specific foods like leafy greens, citrus fruits, etc. to see which are most impacted by tobacco spending. 

3. Analyze the differential impacts on rural versus urban households, or households with agricultural income versus wage income. There may be important differences between subgroups. 

4. Conduct qualitative research through focus groups or interviews to better understand the thought process behind spending tradeoffs related to tobacco use. Surveys provide useful data but interviews could provide insights into people's decision making.

5. Evaluate the impact of potential tobacco control policy changes on spending patterns. For example, model the effects of a tax increase on tobacco to see how it changes household budgets and consumption. This could help inform policy decisions.
