Outbreak reconstruction methods 14 aiming to identify who-infected-whom by combining epidemiological and genetic data could 15 contribute to achieving this goal. However, the majority of these methods remain untested on 16 realistic simulated multi-host data. Mycobacterium bovis is a slowly evolving multi-host 17 pathogen and previous studies on outbreaks involving both cattle and wildlife have identified 18 observation biases. Indeed, contrary to cattle, sampling wildlife is difficult. The aim of our 19 study was to evaluate and compare the performances of three existing outbreak reconstruction 20 methods (seqTrack, outbreaker2 and TransPhylo) on M. bovis multi-host data simulated with 21 and without biases. 22 Extending an existing transmission model, we simulated 30 bTB outbreaks involving 23 cattle, badgers and wild boars and defined six sampling schemes mimicking observation biases. 24 We estimated general and specific to multi-host systems epidemiological indicators. We tested 25 four alternative transmission scenarios changing the mutation rate or the composition of the 26 epidemiological system. The reconstruction of who-infected-whom was sensitive to the 27 mutation rate and seqTrack reconstructed prolific super-spreaders. TransPhylo and outbreaker2 28 poorly estimated the contribution of each host-species and could not reconstruct the presence 29 of a dead-end epidemiological host. However, the host-species of cattle (but not badger) index 30 cases was correctly reconstructed by seqTrack and outbreaker2. These two specific indicators 31 improved when considering an observation bias. 32 We found an overall poor performance for the three methods on simulated biased and 33 unbiased bTB data. This seemed partly attributable to the low evolutionary rate characteristic 34 of M. bovis leading to insufficient genetic information, but also to the complexity of the\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This study highlights the importance of an integrated approach 36 and the need to develop new outbreak reconstruction methods adapted to complex 37 epidemiological systems and tested on realistic multi-host data. 38 Author summary 39 Some pathogens like the one responsible for bovine tuberculosis can infect multiple 40 species. Identifying which species transmitted and to which other species in such an outbreak 41 presents a unique challenge, especially when difficult to observe wildlife species are concerned. 42 One way to tackle this issue would be to reconstruct who-infected-whom in an outbreak and 43 then identify the role each species played. However, methods that enable this type of 44 reconstruction have not been tested in the context of transmission between unevenly observed 45 species. Moreover, the pathogen responsible for bovine tuberculosis evolves slowly, which 46 further complicates the reconstruction of who-infected-whom. We thus simulated realistic and 47 complex bovine tuberculosis outbreaks on which we tested three widely used methods. We 48 found poor performances for all three tested methods, which highlights the need to develop new 49 methods adapted to outbreaks involving multiple species. Our results also underline the need to 50 combine multiple types of methods and data sources in addition to the reconstruction of who51 infected-whom, such as the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees or identifying possible 52 infectious contacts through investigations, when studying an outbreak. 53 Introduction 54 Over 60% of pathogens can infect more than one host-species [1,2]. This possible 55 contribution of multiple host-species to transmission dynamics complicates disease control and 56 surveillance for these multi-host pathogens, especially when one of the host-species to consider 57 is a free-ranging wildlife species. Indeed, quantifying contribution to transmission in order to 58 select appropriate control measures as well as the implementation of said measures can be\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Multi-host pathogens can have important consequences on human health (e.g. 62 zoonotic diseases endemic in wildlife [4]), biodiversity (e.g. canine distemper in lions, Panthera 63 leo, in the Serengeti national park [5]) and animal trade economy (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease 64 and avian influenza [6]). 65 A prime example of a multi-host pathogen, for which the contribution of wildlife species 66 needs to be considered, is Mycobacterium bovis, the most frequent etiological agent of bovine 67 tuberculosis (bTB). Indeed, while M. bovis mainly affects cattle, which have been the target of 68 bTB control programs in the European Union since 1964 (EU directive 64/432/EEC), other 69 domestic and wildlife host-species can also be infected [7]. Furthermore, wildlife species have 70 even been implicated around the world as bTB reservoirs, e.g. badgers (Meles meles) in the 71 United Kingdom [8], wild boars (Sus scrofa) in Spain [9] and brush-tailed possums 72 (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand (10). In France, infected wildlife presenting the same 73 genotypes as nearby infected cattle have been reported by the wildlife surveillance program 74 since its implementation in 2012 [11], which suggests bTB transmission between wildlife and 75 cattle and therefore, the presence of bTB multi-host systems. 76 Studies have aimed to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from M. bovis whole genome 77 sequences, present in cattle and wildlife, in order to better understand transmission within these 78 multi-host systems [12\u201315]. In a phylogenetic tree, internal nodes correspond to hypothetical 79 common ancestors and, using Bayesian methods, the ancestral state (e.g. host-species [16,17] 80 or geographical location [18,19]) of these internal nodes can be estimated. These Bayesian 81 methods can therefore reconstruct the host-species of the most recent common ancestor of all 82 sampled sequences [20] as well as transitions between species or groups of individuals over 83 time [15,17], but not transmission events at an individual level.

Such a reconstruction of 86 who-infected-whom in the outbreak makes it possible to estimate transmission parameters 87 specific to each host-species (such as the number of transmission events due to an individual of 88 a particular host-species), and thus sheds more light on the transmission dynamics within the 89 studied multi-host system. 90 In principle, outbreak (here meaning transmission tree) reconstruction could be based 91 solely on epidemiological data obtained via contact tracing methods (e.g. [22]); however data 92 collected are not always reliable nor detailed enough to enable accurate reconstruction [23]. 93 Therefore, some outbreak reconstruction methods have combined both genomic and 94 epidemiological data in transmission tree inference [24\u201329]. These outbreak reconstruction 95 methods can be divided into two categories according to how genomic data is treated [30], those 96 that consider a link between phylogenetic and transmission trees (generally by annotating 97 branches or internal nodes with infected hosts) [26,28,31,32] and those that solely consider 98 genetic distances [21,25,33]. While some outbreak reconstruction methods were developed to 99 study pathogen transmission within a specific multi-host system (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease 100 [34]), most were developed using the example of a single-host system, e.g. slowly evolving M. 101 tuberculosis [26,31], and more rapidly evolving pathogens like methicillin-resistant 102 Staphylococcus aureus [26,33] or SARS-CoV-1 [25] in a human population. However, the 103 development of outbreak reconstruction methods on single-host systems does not preclude them 104 from yielding insightful results in multi-host systems; for instance Willgert et al. recently 105 reconstructed the transmission history of SARS-CoV-2 in a human-deer system in Iowa (USA) 106 [35]. In a multi-host system, other than correctly reconstructing transmission events between 107 individuals and estimating outbreak size (general epidemiological indicators), we expect 108 outbreak reconstruction methods to allow accurate estimation of host-species contribution to\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

When not all cases are sampled in the 115 outbreak, there exists a difference between the actual outbreak and the transmission tree these 116 methods can aim to reconstruct from sampled sequences. Indeed, even if the outbreak 117 reconstruction method accounts for the presence of unsampled hosts [25,31], these hosts can 118 only be inferred if they have descendant sampled hosts [35] and the transmission tree that can 119 be reconstructed is therefore a subtree induced by the sampling process. 120 The sampling process in a multi-host system that implicates a free-ranging wildlife 121 species can also result in incomplete or even biased data, when observation efforts differ 122 between host-species. For instance, M. bovis wildlife surveillance in France was implemented 123 later than cattle surveillance (2012 vs. 1954) and only investigates bTB infection in badgers, 124 boars, red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) [11]. However, 125 estimations of bTB infection rates in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have recently been investigated 126 in France and yielded similar results to those found in badgers and wild boars [37]. These 127 sampling biases between host-species could have an important impact on outbreak 128 reconstruction. 129 Our aim was to evaluate and compare performances of existing outbreak reconstruction 130 methods on bTB outbreaks in a multi-host system and study whether these performances were 131 affected by sampling biases. Therefore, we simulated bTB transmission within a multi-host 132 system situated in a previously studied area in the South-West of France. In this area, bTB 133 surveillance has reported M. bovis circulation in cattle, badgers and wild boars [38].

In order to 136 evaluate the quality of reconstructed transmission trees, we calculated general as well as 137 specific multi-host epidemiological indicators. 138 Materials and methods 139 1. Reference transmission trees 140 1.1 Transmission model 141 We extended an existing model that simulated bTB transmission trees, for the 11 142 genotypes identified, in a badger-cattle system present in a study area in the South-West of 143 France, from January 2007 to January 2020 [39]. We narrowed our study to one of the two 144 genotypes of M. bovis, which were isolated in both wildlife and cattle within our study region. 145 Since infected wild boars have also been detected in this study area [40,41] and our aim was to 146 study a complex multi-host system, we added a wild boar meta-population to the modeled 147 epidemiological system (see details in S1 Appendix). Similarly to the badger population, wild 148 boars could either be susceptible (S) or infected (I) while cattle had an additional latent state 149 (E), when animals could be detected infected but could not transmit the pathogen [39]. 150 Moreover, transmission trees simulated with the original model considered cattle farms 151 and badger social groups as epidemiological units whereas we aimed to reconstruct individual 152 transmission links. Therefore, we extended the model to randomly select infected animals 153 within these groups according to the SEI/SI system dynamics and thus, simulated animal-to154 animal transmission. The resulting transmission trees are termed below reference transmission 155 trees (terms written in italic are defined in Table 1).\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We generated 30 reference transmission trees, in order to investigate various 159 simulated outbreaks while limiting the computational time. These 30 trees had to include less 160 than 500 infected hosts in total, for computational reasons, and at least 15 infected hosts from 161 each host-species, in order to be able to implement sampling schemes. A reference transmission 162 tree corresponded to a list of six variables: identification (id) of infector, id of infected, host163 species of infector, host-species of infected, date of infection and date of death. 164 We simulated genetic sequences along the reference trees according to a Hasegawa165 Kishino-Yano (HKY) substitution model (with transition/transversion ratio parameter, \u03ba) [42], 166 since this substitution model was previously used to study M. bovis phylogenies [12\u201314], as 167 well as a fixed mutation rate (\u00b5). We chose \u00b5 equal to 0.0024 substitutions per site per year and 168 \u03ba equal to 5.9. Indeed, these values had been previously estimated on 167 M. bovis sequences 169 (171 SNPs in length) isolated in cattle and wildlife from this study area [12]. 170 At t = 0, we considered that the index case was infected by a single sequence randomly 171 selected from the 167 sequences isolated in our study area [12]. Our substitution algorithm was 172 based on the Gillespie approach [43] implemented in the phastSim package [44] (Fig 1). Taking 173 into account the low genetic diversity observed in M. bovis sequences from the same region, 174 we assumed no within-host diversity by considering a single lineage per host but we allowed 175 within-host mutation. 176 We simulated sequences until February 2020. Then, the last simulated sequence was 177 recorded for each host, which corresponded to either the sequence present at the time of removal 178 or in February 2020, for infected hosts not yet removed at the end of the simulation. For each 179 reference transmission tree, we thus obtained a reference set of cases (Table 1), meaning a list\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Sequence simulation procedure in two infected hosts A and B. Host A, represented by the 183 grey rectangle on the left (infected at Tinfection_A), transmitted the pathogen to host B at Tinfection_B. This 184 transmission event is represented by the thick black arrow. Hosts were removed (represented by the 185 cross) respectively at Tremoval_A and Tremoval_B. If the mutation time was inferior to the host removal time 186 (which was the case for Tmutation_A1 and Tmutation_A2 in host A), we then selected the nucleotide to mutate 187 (the 3rd nucleotide for the first mutation and the 2nd nucleotide for the second mutation in host A, shown 188 in white) and changed it according to a substitution model. If the mutation time was superior to the 189 removal time of the host (see host B), the sequence did not change until host removal and this sequence 190 was then the one sampled from the host. 191 2. Sampling schemes and reconstructed transmission trees 192 2.1 Sampling schemes 193 We first considered the hypothetical situation where all infected hosts are observed 194 (reference sampling scheme, Table 1), which corresponds to the reference set of cases. Then, 195 we simulated five sampling schemes that mimicked observation biases in bTB epidemiological 196 data, while also sampling all infected hosts unaffected by the scheme (even those not yet 197 removed at the end of the simulation). In scheme T (for \u201ctemporal bias\u201d), the late 198 implementation of wildlife surveillance in the study region was simulated and we only 199 considered wildlife cases after 2012. Moreover, the fact that not all host-species are surveilled 200 was simulated in schemes S (for \u201cspecies bias\u201d): either wild boar cases were not considered, 201 scheme SW, or badger cases, in scheme SB. Finally, in scheme T+SW (or T+SB), we disregarded 202 cases before 2012 for the remaining wildlife species (respectively badgers and wild boars). 203 We thus simulated for each reference transmission tree one biased set of cases (Table 204 1) for each sampling scheme (T, SB, SW, T+SB, T+SW), that contained the same variables as the 205 reference set of cases. With 30 reference trees for each sampling scheme, we thus obtained a 206 total of 30*6 = 180 sets of cases. For each of these sets of cases, we extracted from the reference 207 transmission tree, the reconstructible outbreak (Table 1), which is the subtree containing only 208 the cases that were sampled and their ancestors.\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In seqTrack and outbreaker2, transmission is estimated 213 based on pairwise genetic distances, while in TransPhylo, a link is established between 214 phylogenetic and transmission trees [30].\n215 o seqTrack 216 Using Edmonds\u2019 algorithm, seqTrack computes the transmission tree in which the total 217 genetic distance between nodes is minimal, assuming that infectors are sampled before the host 218 they infected [21]. In order to use this method, we estimated pairwise genetic distances by using 219 the dist.dna function (ape R package v.5.4-1 [45]) with the F84 substitution model since it 220 closely resembles the HKY model [42]. seqTrack [21] is a function available in the adegenet R 221 package [46,47]. The format of the tree reconstructed by seqTrack was a table with five columns 222 corresponding to the following variables: id (indices of infected hosts), ances (indices of 223 infectors), weight (number of mutations separating infected hosts from their infectors), date 224 (sampling date of the infected host), ances.date (sampling date of their infector).\n225 o outbreaker2 226 outbreaker2 is a Bayesian method that considers four likelihoods: genetic, temporal, 227 reporting and contact [25]. In this method, probability of transmission is inferred from known 228 generation time (time between the infection of a case and the time of transmission from that 229 case to secondary cases) and sampling interval (time from infection to sampling) distributions. 230 Here, we assumed that generation time and sampling interval nonparametric distributions could 231 be obtained without bias by estimating them from the reference trees, which contained every 232 infected host, timed transmission event between hosts and host sampling time. We selected a 233 chain length of 100,000 iterations, a sampling frequency of 1 in 50 and a burn-in period of 10%\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We graphically checked for 235 convergence and independence of sampling (Effective Sample Size (ESS) above 200 for each 236 parameter), after estimation using the coda R package v.0.19-4 [48]. When the ESS were lower 237 than 200, we ran an additional 100,000 iterations and then checked the ESS again. This step 238 was repeated until every ESS was above 200. 239 Then, we built the consensus tree, as suggested by the authors, computing the most 240 frequent infector for each infected host in the posterior trees as well as the support (posterior 241 probability) for each transmission event. By construction, cycles can be present in this 242 consensus tree (which then becomes a directed graph), meaning that infected hosts can be both 243 the ancestors and the descendants of other infected hosts. Moreover, since this method considers 244 a reporting likelihood, the probability of sampling an infected host is estimated and unsampled 245 hosts are indirectly represented in the consensus tree, as a number of generations separating two 246 sampled hosts. 247 The format of the consensus tree reconstructed by outbreaker2 was a table with five 248 columns corresponding to the following variables: from (indices of infectors), to (indices of 249 infected hosts), support (transmission probability), time (estimated time of transmission), date 250 (sampling date of the infected host) and generations (number of intermediary hosts + 1).\n251 o TransPhylo 252 TransPhylo, another Bayesian method, affects infected hosts along branches in a 253 previously reconstructed phylogenetic tree [31] (for details on phylogenetic reconstruction see 254 S1 Appendix). We assumed that the generation time and sampling interval followed a Gamma 255 distribution and that the mean and standard deviation could be obtained without bias by 256 estimating them from the reference trees using the epitrix R package v.0.2.2 [49]. We selected 257 a number of iterations of 500,000, a sampling frequency of 1 in 50 and a burn-in period of 20% 258 (for details on priors used and other arguments see S1 Appendix). We used the same method as\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

When the ESS were lower than 100, we ran an additional 500,000 iterations and then 262 checked the ESS again. This step was repeated until convergence and independence of sampling 263 parameters were satisfied or the number of iterations reached 2,500,000, we then discarded the 264 reference trees for which convergence was not obtained in every sampling scheme. 265 Then, as described by Didelot et al. [50], we computed the medoid transmission tree 266 (the transmission tree that is the least different from all other posterior trees according to a 267 distance metric defined by Kendall et al. [51]). This method accounts for the presence of 268 unsampled hosts when affecting hosts to branches in the phylogenetic tree, and unsampled hosts 269 are explicitly represented as nodes in the medoid transmission tree. This means that in the 270 medoid tree, contrary to the consensus tree in outbreaker2, unknown infected hosts can be 271 responsible for more than one transmission event. As in outbreaker2, TransPhylo estimates a 272 sampling probability. 273 The format of the medoid tree reconstructed by TransPhylo was a table with four 274 columns corresponding to the following variables: tinfection (estimated time of infection), 275 tremoved (estimated time of removal of the infected host), infector_id (id of infector), 276 infected_id (id of infected). 277 From the sampled posterior trees, we also computed the n-by-n matrix of transmission 278 probability using the computeMatWIW function implemented in TransPhylo, where n is the 279 number of sampled infected hosts. Then, we identified for each infected host, its most likely 280 infector corresponding to the infector with the highest probability in the matrix of transmission 281 probabilities. If this probability was zero, we considered the most likely infector of the infected 282 host to be unknown. Note that this method of summarizing posterior trees can lead to the\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Genetic information and epidemiological indicators\n286 3.1 Genetic information\n287 To understand the impact of the sequence simulation model on outbreak reconstruction 288 and facilitate comparison with other works, we first quantified the genetic diversity present in 289 each simulated set of cases. We estimated the proportion of unique sequences in every set of 290 cases obtained with the reference sampling scheme as well as the mean transmission 291 divergence. Transmission divergence was defined in Campbell et al.\u2019s work [52] as the number 292 of SNPs separating known transmission pairs, we used reference transmission trees to identify 293 transmission pairs and calculated the mean number of SNPs separating these transmission pairs 294 for every reference tree.\n295 3.2 Epidemiological indicators\n296 TransPhylo had two different outputs (the medoid tree and transmission probability 297 matrix). We used the transmission probability matrix when evaluating the method\u2019s accuracy 298 and the medoid tree for all other indicators. 299 o Accuracy\n300 In order to evaluate the performance of all three reconstruction methods, we first 301 determined the correct transmission events that could be reconstructed between individuals 302 from each simulated set of cases. For the reference set of cases, the correct transmission events 303 were those present in the reference trees. However, for each biased set of cases, we considered 304 that the correct transmission events were those that connected observed cases to each other, 305 bypassing intermediary unobserved cases. For instance, the chain of transmission Sampled 306 subject #1 \u2192 Unobserved subject #2 \u2192 Sampled subject #3 would become Sampled subject\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

For all three methods, we estimated whether reconstructed infector308 infected pairs (meaning every \u201cid\u201d-\u201cances\u201d for seqTrack, \u201cfrom\u201d-\u201cto\u201d for outbreaker2 and 309 \u201cinfector_id\u201d-\u201cinfected_id\u201d for the transmission matrix estimated from TransPhylo) were one 310 of the correct transmission events or not.\n311 o Presence of super-spreaders\n312 For all three methods, we considered super-spreaders to be present in a reconstructed 313 tree when less than 10% of infected hosts were responsible for over 80% of transmission events. 314 Moreover, when super-spreaders were present in a reconstructed tree, we identified the 315 maximum number of transmission events a single super-spreader could be responsible for as 316 well as the host-species of said super-spreader.\n317 o Host-species of the index case\n318 We evaluated the ability of all three methods to reconstruct the correct host-species of 319 the index case (i.e. cattle). Contrary to the TransPhylo medoid trees, in which identifying the 320 index case is straightforward (\u201cinfected_id\u201d with the earliest \u201ctinfection\u201d), the presence of 321 cycles in outbreaker2 and the multiples index cases possible in seqTrack complicated the 322 identification of the index case. For seqTrack, we considered the most frequent host-species 323 from the reconstructed index cases (\u201cid\u201d for whom the \u201cances\u201d is unknown). For outbreaker2, 324 we considered the host-species of the index case to be the most frequent host-species among 325 cases infected at the earliest date (\u201cto\u201d with the earliest \u201ctime\u201d).\n326 o Outbreak size\n327 We evaluated the ability of outbreaker2 and TransPhylo to estimate the size of the 328 outbreak (seqTrack does not estimate outbreak size and was thus excluded for this indicator). 329 The simulated outbreak size was the number of infected hosts present in each reference tree. 330 We calculated the corresponding estimate by dividing the number of sampled hosts in each\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In addition, we tested if the results for this indicator differed depending on whether 333 we were considering the reconstructible outbreak or the reference tree. Therefore, we also 334 calculated the number of infected hosts present in the reconstructible outbreak, and compared 335 it with the number of hosts (sampled and unsampled) present in the trees reconstructed by 336 outbreaker2 and TransPhylo.\n337 o Host-species contribution\n338 Considering the importance of identifying the host-species that contributed the most to 339 transmission in a multi-host system, we evaluated the ability of outbreaker2 and TransPhylo to 340 reconstruct the number of transmission events due to each host-species. Similarly to the 341 outbreak size, seqTrack was also excluded. The number of transmission events due to each 342 host-species was first calculated in the reference trees. As for the outbreak size, we calculated 343 the corresponding estimate by dividing the number of transmission events between sampled 344 hosts in each reconstructed tree with the median of the sampling proportion provided by 345 outbreaker2 and TransPhylo. We then calculated the number of transmission events due to each 346 host-species in the reconstructible outbreak. This number was compared to the number of all 347 transmission events (to sampled and unsampled infected hosts) due to each host-species present 348 in the reconstructed trees.\n349 o Statistical analysis\n350 For the outbreak size and host-species contribution estimates, we obtained a credible 351 interval using the bounds of the 95%HPD (High Posterior Density) interval. For each 352 reconstructed tree, we evaluated whether the credible interval contained the simulated outbreak 353 size or number of transmission events due to each host-species. For all epidemiological 354 indicators except the presence of super-spreaders, we tested the effect on the indicator value of\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

For accuracy and index case, we selected a binomial 359 distribution and the probability of either reconstructing a correct transmission event or the 360 correct host-species for the index case was set as the outcome. Due to the overdispersion present 361 in the estimates of outbreak size and number of transmission events, we considered for both 362 indicators a negative binomial distribution. Since, for outbreak size and host-species 363 contribution, we aimed to compare estimates with the values in either the reference tree or the 364 reconstructible outbreak, these values were set as an offset and the intercept was set to zero. 365 The estimated incidence rates ratios (IRRs) could therefore be interpreted as multiplicative 366 factors of the outbreak size (or host contribution) in the reference tree (or reconstructible 367 outbreak).\n368 4. Alternative transmission scenarios\n369 We tested the influence of the low evolutionary rate, which is characteristic of M. bovis, 370 on our results. We simulated new sequences along the 30 reference trees having increased the 371 mutation rate by a factor of 10 (\u00b5h = 0.024 substitutions per site per year) and implemented the 372 three outbreak reconstruction methods on the reference set of cases only.\n373 To test whether the reconstruction of outbreak size and accuracy were influenced by the 374 complexity of the epidemiological system, we then simulated 30 new reference trees of a single375 host system, by setting transmission parameters to, between and from wildlife to 0, in order to 376 obtain cattle-only transmission trees. We simulated sequences along these 30 new trees with \u00b5 377 (0.0024 substitutions per site per year), then implemented the three methods on these sequences.\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

With the same protocol (30 reference trees 380 and a low evolutionary rate), we tested a transmission scenario where one of the host-species 381 could be infected but could not play any role in transmission (dead-end epidemiological host). 382 We obtained a multi-host system where wild boars played no part in onward bTB transmission 383 by setting transmission parameters between and from wild boars to 0.\n384 Finally, in order to evaluate the reconstruction of the host-species of the index case, we 385 simulated 30 new reference trees with badgers as index cases, in the multi-host system where 386 every host-species contributed to transmission.\n387 Table 1. Definition of terms used in the study (in order of appearance in the material and method).\nReference (transmission) tree A list of six variables (id of infector, id of infected, host-species of infector, host-species of infected, date of infection and date of death) obtained with the modified simulation model (first developed by Bouchez-Zacria et al. [39]). Reference set of cases A list of four variables (id of infected, host-species of infected, date of death and sampled sequence) obtained from the reference tree after sequence simulation. Sampling scheme One of six selection processes applied to a reference set of cases, five of which mimicked biases encountered on bTB data. Biased set of cases Set of cases obtained after applying a biased sampling scheme to a reference set of cases. Reconstructible outbreak A subset of the reference tree that contained only the sampled infected hosts and their ancestors. Transmission scenario Describes the combination of: the type of epidemiological system (multi- or single-host), whether all species contribute to transmission (presence or absence of dead-end hosts), the hostspecies of the index case (badger or cattle) and the mutation rate (low or high).\n388 Results\n389 1.

Moreover, phylogenetic reconstruction with 400 BEAST2 was needed to implement TransPhylo and computational time also varied between 401 sets of cases: from five hours to two days. In total, the computational time for these 378 (126 402 trees*3 methods) reconstructed trees was around three months.\n403 The median proportion of unique sequences in the reference set of cases for which 404 convergence was obtained was 6.1%. The median of the mean transmission divergence was 405 0.19 (S1 Table) and the majority of transmission pairs shared the same sequence (S1 Fig).\n406 All trees reconstructed by outbreaker2 as well as all transmission probability matrices 407 estimated by TransPhylo, for which we kept the most probable infectors, presented cycles.\n408 2.

The median of 433 the maximum number of transmission events a single super-spreader could be responsible for 434 ranged from 90 to 108, while the median number of transmission events in the reconstructed 435 trees ranged from 200 to 244 (S3 Table). The most frequent host-species responsible for this 436 maximum number of transmission events was cattle (from 57% in the reference sampling 437 scheme to 86% in the combined temporal and wild boars bias). None of the trees reconstructed 438 by the two other methods presented super-spreaders.\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Except when considering the temporal bias 443 alone with the TransPhylo method, a temporal and a badger bias (combined or not) led to an 444 increase in the proportion of correctly reconstructed index cases.\n445 2.4 Outbreak size\n446 In the reference trees, the median number of infected hosts was 245 (S5 Table). Overall, 447 the simulated outbreak size was close to the credible interval estimated by outbreaker2 (Fig 3). 448 Indeed, this credible interval contained the simulated outbreak size for all 21 trees reconstructed 449 with the reference and temporal sampling scheme. However, a species bias (combined or not 450 with a temporal bias) decreased the number of trees that correctly estimated the outbreak size 451 and led to a majority of trees that underestimated the outbreak size (20/21 with SB and T+SB, 452 16/21 for SW and 18/21 for T+SW). According to the statistical model, the outbreak size 453 estimated by outbreaker2 was not significantly different to the reference tree size (IRR= 1.14, 454 p-value=0.43) and sampling schemes had no significant effect on outbreak size (Table 3).\n455 Fig 3.

The reference and temporal sampling scheme led to an overestimation of the outbreak 462 size in the majority of reconstructed trees (19/21 and 16/21): the credible intervals contained 463 the simulated outbreak size in 3 and 5 out of 21 trees, respectively. The number of correct 464 estimations remained low for the other types of biases.

Moreover, all biased schemes except for 467 the temporal bias significantly lowered the estimated outbreak size (IRR ranging from 0.49 to 468 0.68 and p-value <0.01).\n469 Table 3.

Otherwise, the number of transmission events 482 in the majority of the remaining trees was either underestimated (cattle: 14/21 trees for 483 outbreaker2 and 13/21 trees for TransPhylo), overestimated (badgers: 19/21 trees for 484 outbreaker2 and 13/21 trees for TransPhylo) or no particular trend was observed (wild boars). 485 Similar results were obtained with the other five sampling schemes (S2-S4 Figs).\n486 Fig 4.

The 492 statistical model confirmed the results obtained for badgers, since the number of transmission 493 events due to badgers estimated by both methods was significantly higher than the simulated 494 number (IRR=2.06 for outbreaker2 and 1.70 for TransPhylo, p-value<0.001) (Table 4). Results 495 did not show a significant effect of the sampling scheme on badger contribution for 496 outbreaker2. However, the sampling scheme with the least number of sampled hosts (temporal 497 and wild boar biases combined) significantly decreased the number of transmission events due 498 to badgers compared to the reference sampling scheme in trees reconstructed by TransPhylo. 499 Finally, the number of transmission events due to wild boars estimated by both methods was 500 not significantly different to the simulated number in the reference tree (Table 4).\n501 Table 4.

Alternative transmission scenarios\n509 3.1 Higher mutation rate\n510 As expected, sequences simulated with a higher mutation rate presented a higher 511 proportion of unique sequences (median: 33.4%) and a higher mean transmission divergence 512 (median: 0.69) (S7 Table).\n513 A higher mutation rate increased markedly the median accuracy for all three methods: 514 25.7% (+17.7, range: 15.9-33.3) for outbreaker2, 15.3% (+11.9, range: 8.2-33.3) for seqTrack 515 and 21.2% (+12.3, range: 13.2-29.3) for TransPhylo (S8-S9 Tables). While the majority of trees 516 reconstructed by seqTrack again contained super-spreaders (20/21), the median of the 517 maximum number of transmission events due to a single super-spreader was lower when 518 considering a higher mutation rate (35 vs. 108, S10 Table).\n519 The credible interval contained the simulated outbreak size for 16/21 trees reconstructed 520 by outbreaker2 and in only 4/21 trees reconstructed by TransPhylo, otherwise the outbreak size 521 was overestimated (Fig 5 and S11 Table). For both methods, the credible interval contained the 522 number of transmission events due to each host-species in only 4/21 trees for cattle, 3/21 523 (outbreaker2) and 5/21 (TransPhylo) for badgers and 1/21 for wild boars (Fig 6). Otherwise, 524 cattle contribution was underestimated by TransPhylo (16/21 trees in Fig 6, and S12 Table) and 525 wildlife contribution was overestimated by outbreaker2 (13/21 trees for badgers and wild boars 526 in Fig 6, and S12 Table).\n527 Fig 5.

Super-spreaders were 540 present in all trees reconstructed by seqTrack but also in trees reconstructed by outbreaker2 541 (5/26 trees, median of maximum 39 transmission events due to a single super-spreader) and 542 TransPhylo (10/26 trees, median: 39.5) (S10 Table).\n543 The credible interval contained the simulated outbreak size in all 26 trees reconstructed 544 by outbreaker2 and in 16/26 trees reconstructed by TransPhylo, otherwise the outbreak size 545 was overestimated (Fig 7 and S11 Table).\n546 Fig 7.

M. bovis, characterized by a low mutation rate, is 570 a prime example of a multi-host pathogen for which sampling biases complicate the estimation 571 of host-species contribution to transmission, an estimation which is however necessary to select 572 appropriate measures for disease control. Contrary to previous evaluations of outbreak 573 reconstruction methods, the transmission model we used to simulate our data was not tailored 574 to a specific method [25,31,52] but to the slowly evolving multi-host pathogen. Moreover, the 575 epidemiological indicators we estimated were also relevant in a multi-host system and not just 576 general performance indicators [53].\n577 Reconstructing transmission trees can have multiple objectives according to the studied 578 pathogen and epidemiological system, the most obvious objective is the accurate reconstruction 579 of who-infected-whom. The proportion of correctly reconstructed transmission events (which 580 we called accuracy) has previously been used to evaluate performances of outbreak 581 reconstruction methods [25,53]. With the low mutation rate characteristic of M. bovis, we 582 estimated poor accuracies (median accuracy lower than 9% for all three methods). Sobkowiak 583 et al. compared these outbreak reconstruction methods on real M. tuberculosis data, which is\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Contrary to the accuracy indicator we estimated, the links between cases were not 587 directed, we thus expected this study to estimate a higher number of correctly reconstructed 588 cases. The PPV estimated by Sobkowiak et al. was 15% for TransPhylo, 11% for outbreaker2 589 and 10% for seqTrack. These PPV values were in the range of values we estimated for accuracy 590 and the ranking of methods was the same as the one we obtained (with TransPhylo as the best, 591 followed by outbreaker2).\n592 Accuracy was little influenced by the sampling biases or the complexity of the 593 epidemiological system, however it was greatly dependent on the mutation rate. When the 594 mutation rate was multiplied by a factor of 10 (~6.6 x 10-5 substitutions per site per day), the 595 accuracies we estimated more than doubled. In the study that presented and tested outbreaker2, 596 Campbell et al. estimated the average proportion of transmission pairs correctly inferred when 597 using solely temporal and genetic information from simulated Ebola virus (mutation rate: 0.31 598 x 10-5 per site per day) and SARS-CoV-1 (1.14 x 10-5 per site per day) outbreaks [25]. Moreover, 599 Firestone et al. compared TransPhylo and outbreaker2 on six FMDV outbreaks simulated with 600 a high mutation rate (2.2 x 10-5 per site per day) and estimated the proportion of infected hosts 601 (premises) for which the most likely source predicted was the true source [53]. Since both 602 indicators corresponded to the accuracy we estimated, we expected similar results. However, 603 Campbell et al. estimated an average accuracy of 29% (from the simulated Ebola data) and 70% 604 (SARS-CoV-1). In addition, when genomic data was available for all infected hosts, the 605 accuracy estimated by Firestone et al. was 4% for TransPhylo and 35% for outbreaker2. While 606 these values were respectively higher for outbreaker2 and lower for TransPhylo compared to 607 the range of values we calculated, the ranking of methods obtained by Firestone et al. was the 608 same as the one we obtained (with outbreaker2 as the better of the two).\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

As mentioned by Nigsch et al., seqTrack is thus strongly dependent on the temporal 612 order of sampling dates and when the sampling order does not necessarily coincide with the 613 infection order (here, because of imperfect case detection and sampling protocol varying 614 according to host-species), \u201cthe order of ancestries cannot be inferred with certainty\u201d [55]. 615 Contrary to what we observed with outbreaker2 and TransPhylo, trees reconstructed by 616 seqTrack presented super-spreaders with extreme numbers of transmission events due to a 617 single infected host (over a hundred transmissions) that lowered when considering a higher 618 mutation rate. The low genetic diversity combined with the lack of a transmission model could 619 therefore account for the reconstruction of super-spreaders, which in turn could contribute to 620 the low accuracy. Similarly, the lower genetic diversity obtained with the single-host system 621 could explain the presence of less prolific super-spreaders in trees reconstructed with 622 TransPhylo and outbreaker2.\n623 While we estimated poor accuracies for all three methods, a high proportion of correctly 624 reconstructed directed transmission events is difficult to obtain and might not be the main 625 objective when studying a multi-host system implicating wildlife or with a low sampling 626 proportion. However, the presence of super-spreaders is an important indicator to consider since 627 it highlighted the fact that seqTrack reconstructed unrealistic transmission dynamics with 628 prolific super-spreaders.\n629 Other than reconstructing who-infected-whom, outbreak reconstruction can aim to 630 estimate epidemiological indicators, from which practical measures can be directly inferred. 631 The first we studied was the outbreak size, which could by comparison with the number of 632 sampled cases be informative e.g. of the need to increase the sampling effort [35]. Outbreak 633 size estimation was sensitive to sampling biases, the complexity of the epidemiological system\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The outbreak size was correctly estimated by outbreaker2 but 635 consistently overestimated by TransPhylo, even though we considered the same non636 informative prior for the sampling proportion when implementing both methods. This 637 overestimation could therefore be due to the fact that Didelot et al. developed this method to 638 study partially sampled M. tuberculosis outbreaks and account for within-host diversity [31], 639 whereas we assumed all cases sampled in the reference scheme and no within-host diversity in 640 the sequence simulation. Furthermore, when not all sequences were sampled, better results were 641 obtained for TransPhylo and the estimated outbreak size significantly lowered.\n642 With a higher mutation rate, TransPhylo also overestimated the outbreak size, but to a 643 lesser extent. Xu et al. developed in 2019 a method of simultaneous inference on multiple M. 644 tuberculosis clusters based on TransPhylo. From this study, Xu et al. discussed the link between 645 mutation rate and sampling proportion, explaining that with a faster assumed clock, the 646 branches in the phylogenetic trees are shorter and TransPhylo is therefore less likely to place 647 unsampled cases along them [56]. This could explain the lower effect we estimated.\n648 Some epidemiological indicators are relevant only in the context of a multi-host system 649 and reveal the host-species that should be primarily targeted, such as the identification of the 650 host-species responsible for the outbreak and the accurate reconstruction of each host-species\u2019 651 contribution to the outbreak. The index case indicator was sensitive to sampling biases and to 652 the host-species of the index case. The proportion of correctly reconstructed host-species of the 653 index case was high for outbreaker2 and seqTrack (over 75%) when considering cattle index 654 cases. However, the fact that TransPhylo could designate unsampled hosts as index cases, 655 combined with a tendency to overestimate the outbreak size and thus, the number of unsampled 656 hosts, could explain this method\u2019s poorer performance. Moreover, biased sampling schemes 657 generally led to a higher proportion of correctly reconstructed host-species of the index case, 658 which could be explained by the fact that only non-index cases (wildlife) were concerned by\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Finally, this indicator was sensitive to the host-species responsible for 660 the outbreak and had a poorer performance when the index case was a badger.\n661 Host contribution estimation was influenced by the sampling biases and the complexity 662 of the epidemiological system but not the mutation rate. With either mutation rates, outbreaker2 663 and TransPhylo poorly reconstructed the contribution of each host-species and tended to 664 underestimate the host-species that contributed the most to transmission (cattle) while 665 overestimating those that contributed the least (wildlife). Both outbreak reconstruction methods 666 were developed and tested on single-host systems [21,25,31], and not on multi-host systems 667 where each host-species play a different role. While TransPhylo has previously been applied to 668 multi-host systems, a human-deer SARS-CoV-2 system [35] and two badger-cattle bTB 669 systems [57,58], the estimation of host-species contribution to transmission in these systems 670 was not straightforward. The high number of unsampled cases estimated in the human-deer 671 system (mean sampling proportion of 0.1%) complicated the inference of transmission events 672 and while phylogenetic evidence seemed to support multiple human-to-deer spillover events, 673 deer-to-human transmission could not be ruled out [35]. In a badger-cattle system in the South674 West of England, van Tonder et al. were interested in between-species transmission and as such 675 TransPhylo was implemented in addition to a Bayesian ancestral state reconstruction method 676 (BASTA, [16]), which was primarily used to estimate the number of within- and between677 species transitions [57]. Finally, Akhmetova et al. also implemented TransPhylo in addition to 678 Bayesian phylogenetic methods in a badger-cattle system in Northern Ireland and highlighted 679 a mostly cattle-driven (over 90% of strongly supported reconstructed transmission events) 680 epidemic in the region [58].\n681 Biases simulated with the sampling schemes resulted in a decrease in the number of 682 infected hosts for which contribution estimates was overestimated. Therefore, when sampling 683 schemes had a significant effect on host contribution, they tended to yield better results with\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In addition, neither outbreaker2 nor TransPhylo 686 could accurately reconstruct asymmetrical roles between host-species, i.e. the presence of a 687 dead-end epidemiological host.\n688 In the epidemiological multi-host system we extended, the basic reproduction number 689 varied according to the combination of host-species considered [39]. Moreover, Bouchez690 Zacria et al. calculated inter- and intra-species generation time distributions that showed a more 691 rapid spread from cattle farms than from badger groups. We added to the transmission model, 692 a third population of host-species (wild boars) that could transmit or not the pathogen. The 693 complexity of this multi-host system could have contributed to the poor results we obtained for 694 host-species contribution. Indeed, both outbreaker2 and TransPhylo considered a single 695 generation time, sampling time and/or offspring distribution for all three host-species, not 696 accounting for host-species variation in the natural history of the disease nor the uneven 697 transmission dynamics. A multi-host system where all three host-species contributed unevenly 698 to transmission is not unusual, results obtained from Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions 699 (Mascot, [19]) in other French regions point to the presence of similarly complex bTB multi700 host systems [59]. Furthermore, the impact of said complexity on method performance does not 701 only concern systems with multiple host-species, pathogens for which different categories (e.g. 702 age groups and/or vaccination status [60]) of hosts can be defined (according to infectiousness 703 or duration of infection) also constitute complex epidemiological systems. Finally, considering 704 what can be reconstructed by the method (reconstructible outbreak) instead of the reference tree 705 did not improve results for the outbreak size nor the host contribution indicators.\n706 We were limited by practical considerations and the ensuing choices we made. With the 707 M. bovis data we simulated, convergence was a limiting factor for TransPhylo but not for 708 outbreaker2. Indeed, in order to limit the computational time, we fixed a maximum number of\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Moreover, in order to 711 better compare reconstructions, we used the same evolutionary model for the phylogenetic 712 reconstruction in BEAST2. A more adapted evolutionary model could lead to a more accurate 713 phylogenetic tree reconstruction and thus, a better performance from TransPhylo.\n714 With the sequence simulation model we implemented, we simulated a low proportion 715 of unique sequences from 13-year-long outbreaks, which is consistent with M. bovis low 716 mutation rate. In the study on 167 M. bovis sequences in the South-West of France from which 717 we selected the value of the mutation rate [12], the proportion of unique sequences isolated 718 (37.1%) was around six times higher than the median proportion we simulated. The higher 719 proportion of unique sequences in this previous study could be due to the fact that not all 720 sequences are sampled in real data and that the outbreak lasted longer as suggested by the 721 MRCA which was estimated to have been circulating 27 years earlier. In the sequence 722 simulation model, we also considered the same mutation rate within all three host-species, 723 however whether M. bovis evolves the same way within different host-species remains 724 unknown. Indeed, M. tuberculosis mutation rates in humans may decrease during periods of 725 latency, which differs from what was observed in non-human primates [61]. A similar 726 phenomenon could lead to variability in the evolution of M. bovis within and between host727 species [62] and thus, to the difference in the proportion of unique sequences observed and 728 simulated.\n729 We chose to compare results from the same epidemiological and genetic data for all 730 three methods. While difficult to implement when studying a slowly evolving multi-host system 731 that implicates wildlife, contact data can be directly incorporated in the transmission tree 732 inference with outbreaker2. The addition of contact data led to higher accuracies than those 733 obtained with only temporal and genetic data in simulated Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-1\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Similarly, when limited genetic diversity was expected in their study on M. 735 avium ssp paratuberculosis, Nigsch et al. took advantage of the fact that seqTrack can 736 incorporate additional data in the form of weighting matrices [55]. They thus resolved equally 737 probable ancestries using known exposure time or susceptibility based on accepted 738 epidemiological knowledge. Even when the method does not allow additional epidemiological 739 data, Xu et al. mentioned that one of the strengths in their study on M. tuberculosis transmission 740 within a Spanish cohort lied in the extensive contact investigation data that allowed them to 741 validate the results of their genomic and TransPhylo analysis [63]. Using these available 742 features and strategies could have improved results obtained for outbreaker2 and seqTrack as 743 well as help evaluate those from TransPhylo. However, since limited real contact data can be 744 obtained for wildlife, we chose not to include additional epidemiological data in this study. 745 Furthermore, we limited our study to only three methods, available in a package and that only 746 needed sampling times as epidemiological data. Additional methods would be interesting to test 747 on this simulated data, especially methods that simultaneously inferred phylogenetic and 748 transmission trees like phybreak [26], since none were considered here. Finally, the simulated 749 multi-host data could also be used to test Bayesian ancestral state reconstruction methods like 750 Mascot [19], previously used to study complex bTB multi-host systems [59].\n751 The overall poor performances we obtained for accuracy and host-species contribution, 752 even without biased sampling schemes, suggest that when studying the transmission of a slowly 753 evolving pathogen in complex multi-host systems, outbreak reconstruction methods should not 754 be implemented alone but as a complement to epidemiological and phylogenetic methods. The 755 difficulty in estimating host-species contribution highlights the need to develop new outbreak 756 reconstruction methods adapted to complex epidemiological systems as well as evaluate these 757 methods on data simulated in multi-host systems and not specific to the each method.\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
