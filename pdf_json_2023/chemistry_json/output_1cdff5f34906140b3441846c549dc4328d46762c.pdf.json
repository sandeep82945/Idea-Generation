    "abstractText": "Low complexity repeat RNA sequences self-associate by homotypic interactions to form condensates. Using simulations of a coarse grained Single-Interaction Site model for (CAG)n (n = 30 and 31), we show that the salt-dependent free energy gap, \u2206GS , between the ground (perfect hairpin) and the excited state (slipped hairpin (SH) with one CAG overhang) of monomer (n even) is the primary factor that determines the rates and yield of self-assembly. For odd n, the SH ground state free energy (GS) is used to predict self-association kinetics. As the monovalent salt concentration, CS , increases \u2206GS and GS increases, which in turn decreases the self-association rates. In contrast, \u2206GS for scrambled sequences, with the same length and sequence composition as (CAG)31 but with higher complexity, is larger which greatly suppresses the propensities to aggregate. Although demonstrated explicitly for (CAG)30 and (CAG)31 polymers, the finding that there is an inverse correlation between CS-dependent \u2206GS or GS and RNA aggregation is general. Our predictions are amenable to experimental tests. 2 .

            "text": "A series of experiments1\u20138 have established that low complexity repeat RNA sequences, such\nas (CAG)n and (CUG)n, (n is the number of repeat units) undergo phase separation. In the two phase region, the high density droplet coexists with the sol or low density dispersed\nphase. The qualitative features of the phase separation may be understood using the venerable Flory-Huggins theory,9,10 although in RNA temperature is not as relevant as salt\nconcentration.\nBesides their intrinsic biological interest, the transcribed products of (CAG)n and (CUG)n are implicated in Huntington\u2019s disease, muscular dystrophy and amytropic lateral sclerosis.11\u201313 Recently, using coarse-grained simulations and theoretical arguments, we pro-\nvided a conceptual framework for describing condensate formation in repeat nucleotide sequences.14,15 The driving force for self association arises both from favorable intermolecular\nWatson-Crick (WC) base pair formation as well as the degeneracy associated with a large number of ways such base pairs can form14,16 in a droplet. In a recent account,15 we showed\nthat the propensity of repeat RNA polymers to aggregate can be inferred from the free en-\nergy spectrum of the monomer. For even n the ground state of (CAG)n polymer is a perfect hairpin (PH) that is stabilized by base stacking and Watson-Crick base pair formation. In\nthis case, we showed that the propensity for self-association between (CAG)n polymer is determined by the free energy gap, \u2206GS, between the ground state (GS) and the excited state in which at least one (CAG) unit is exposed, resulting in slipped hairpin (SH) states.\nThe self-association propensity decreases as \u2206GS increases. For odd n, the GS is already in the SH state, which enhances the propensity to self-associate. Our theoretical prediction\nthat (CAG)2n+1 should have higher tendency to aggregate than (CAG)2n was validated using computer simulations at 0.1 M monovalent salt concentration.15 A recent all atom molecular dynamics simulations of homopolymeric RNA sequences17 have also suggested that single\nchain properties could reveal the propensity to undergo phase separation.\nThe spectrum of states sampled by the (CAG)n polymers may be altered by varying the\nexternal conditions. Here, we explored the extent to which aggregation of (CAG)n changes as the salt concentration is varied. We simulated the two sequences (CAG)30 and (CAG)31 both of which undergo phase separation at high densities. The population of aggregation\nprone hairpin state of the RNAs is suppressed as the salt concentration, CS, increases from 0.15 M to 0.5 M. The rate of formation of dimer decreases with an increase in CS, which is in accord with the theory that \u2206GS increases with increasing CS. In contrast, the propensity to self-associate decreases in scrambled sequences with identical composition because \u2206GS increases substantially."

            "text": "Salt modulates the population of different hairpin structures: We performed low friction Langevin dynamics simulations (see Supporting Information (SI)) at 37 \u25e6 C by varying\nthe salt concentration, CS, from 0.15 M to 0.5 M. The secondary structures obtained at these conditions are classified broadly into stem-loop or hairpin-like structures. The terminal\nnucleotides in the hairpin-like structures are spatially close. Single molecule Foster Resonance\nEnergy Transfer (smFRET) spectroscopy characterized the structures of trinucleotide repeat DNA hairpins ((CTG)n 18 and (CAG)n 19). It was found that the most populated state for (CAG)14 (the 5 \u2032 and 3\u2032 ends are close) is a perfect hairpin whereas the ground state of (CAG)15 is slipped (FRET efficiency is lower compared to the ground state of (CAG)14, thus exposing one CAG unit).\nBecause the FRET efficiency is related to the distribution of the end-to-end distance,\nwe calculated P (Ree) for both A(CAG)30A and A(CAG)31A at CS = 0.15 M and 0.5 M (Figures 1A and 1B). We find that P (Ree) has more than one peak indicating that multiple stem-loop conformations are sampled. The peak at Ree = 1.45 nm is approximately at the equilibrium base pair distance (\u2248 1.38 nm ) between two beads, showing that the terminal\nnucleotides are in spatial proximity. The peaks located at Ree > 1.45 nm are either due to\nbreak down of terminal G-C base pair (bp) or slippage in the strands. As the CS value is increased to 0.5 M from 0.15 M, the amplitude of the first peak in P (Ree) increases for both the sequences, which implies that increment in salt concentration stabilizes the base pair\nstrongly.\nIn order to elucidate the microscopic structures of the stem-loop conformations, we com-\nputed the order parameter, QHP , for a given conformation using the Eq. 2 by accounting for the arrangements of the bps in the stem region. QHP measures the deviation in the arrangement of base pairs in the stem region relative to the the arrangement in the perfect\nhairpin (PH) structure in which there is no mismatches, except for the unavoidable A-A\nmismatches. An ensemble of structures with QHP = 0 is, therefore, identical to the PH (Figure 1E and 1F). The set of bps, Sbp, representing the stem of a PH can be expressed as, Sbp = (i, j) : i + j = NT + 1, where, i and j are the indices of the nucleotides forming the base pair, and NT is the number of nucleotides in the sequence. Hairpins with QHP = m, where, m is a positive integer, signify the strand slippage by m repeat units of CAG from either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end. Fractional values of QHP indicate the formation of one or more than one bulge at the stem region of the hairpins (Figure S3).\nTo investigate the effects of salt on the population of different hairpin states, we calculated\nthe distribution, P (QHP ), of QHP at CS ranging between 0.15 and 0.5 M (Figure 1C, 1D and S1 in SI). The most populated structures or the ground state (GS) conformations of (CAG)30 is a PH, whereas it is a slipped hairpin (SH) with one unit of CAG overhang at the terminal\nfor (CAG)31. Alternation in GS conformation between PH and SH in going from an even to an odd repeats has been observed in both repeat DNA sequences in experiments19,20 and in simulations15 of repeat RNA sequences. Although, the GS remains PH (SH) for (CAG)30 ((CAG)31) at all CS values, its population changes as CS value is varied. For instance, the population of the PH of (CAG)30 changes to \u2248 0.33 from \u2248 0.28 as CS is increased to 0.5\nM from 0.15 M. Notably, there is a decrease in P (QHP = 2) and P (QHP = 1), which shows that the population of slipped hairpin decreases as CS increases. Interestingly, we also found a suppression in the population in P (QHP = 1) for (CAG)31. Combining the results for (CAG)30 and (CAG)31, we conclude that slippage in strands is reduced as CS increases. Experiments probing the slippage dynamics of (CAG)14 and (CAG)15 DNA sequences have observed similar effects on the population of slipped hairpin.19\nFree energy spectrum of the (CAG)n polymers as a function of CS: Our theory is that the free energy gap, \u2206GS, separating the GS and the excited state, which contains one or more overhangs of CAG repeats at the terminal, is the key determinant of the association\nrate between RNA chains. To test the theory, we first computed the free energy spectrum for (CAG)30 and (CAG)31 for 0.15 \u2264 CS \u2264 0.5 M using Eq. 3 (Figure 2 and S2 in SI). As is evident from Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A, \u2206GS separating the GS and the first excited state, with two CAG overhangs, increases with increasing CS. In contrast, the GS of CAG 31 has one CAG overhang (Fig. 2B), which is susceptible to self-association. In principle, \u2206GS is 0 for (CAG)31 as the GS itself contains an overhang region. However, the free energy of the GS increases as CS increases, which is reflected in the decrease in P (QHP = 1) (Fig. 1D). As a result, one should expect the dimerization rate for (CAG)31 to decrease with an increase in CS. We show \u2206GS and GS as a function of CS for (CAG)30 and (CAG)31, respectively, in Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B. We find that \u2206GS as a function of CS increases, which suggests that the association of repeat RNAs through homotypic interactions should decrease with\nan increase in CS.\nDimerization of hairpins as a function of CS: To test our prediction, we performed Brownian dynamics simulations for dimer formation starting from the ground state of the\nhairpin structures. The simulations were performed by confining four RNA chains in the\nhairpin conformation inside a sphere of radius, R0 (see SI for details). We set R0 = 100 A\u030a so\nthat initially the monomers interact only weakly with each other. We ran 100 independent trajectories monitoring the formation of dimer for 0.15 \u2264 CS \u2264 0.5 M at 27 \u25e6 C. We calculated the fraction of bps, f 12bp , formed between two chains as a function of time to assess if the hairpins formed a duplex (Figure S4). If f 12bp exceeds 0.5, the monomers are in the duplex structure. We computed the number of trajectories leading to the dimer state, PD, as a function of time, t (Figure S5). There are \u2248 55 (\u2248 42) trajectories in which a dimer formed\nfor (CAG)31 ((CAG)30) at CS = 0.15 M. The number of dimer forming trajectories for (CAG)31 ((CAG)30) decreases to 47 (29) as the CS is increased to 0.5 M from 0.15 M. In the the concentration range ( 0.15 < CS < 0.5 M), the number of dimer forming trajectories do not vary significantly.\nTo compare the propensity to form a dimer at different CS, we calculated the mean first passage time (MFPT), at each salt concentration (Figure 3). The first passage time (FPT), \u03c4FPT , for each dimer forming trajectory is identified with the time at which f 12 bp = 0.5. The\nMFPT is given by \u2211ND\nk=1 \u03c4 k FPT/ND, where, \u03c4 k FPT is the FPT for the k th trajectory and ND is\nthe total number of dimer forming trajectories. Fig. 3C and 3D show the MFPT as a function of CS. Our finding that the rate of dimerization (\u221d MFPT\u22121) decreases as CS increases accords well with the theoretical prediction. The modest change in MFPT in varying CS is related to the small change in \u2206GS as a function of CS in the wild type sequences.\nHairpin opening is the rate determining step in RNA aggregation: Salts influ-\nence the time (\u03c4conv) required for unwinding the intra-molecular bps during the conversion of hairpins into an anti-parallel duplex structure by modulating the stability of intra-molecular\nbps. To investigate the effects of salts on \u03c4conv, we computed \u03c4conv for each trajectory at CS = 0.15 M and 0.5 M. Consider the part of the trajectory which leads to the formation of dimer (f 12bp = 0.5) without re-entering into the hairpin state. We define \u03c4conv as the time required for dimerization to be complete once association between the chains starts (Figure S7A).\n\u03c4conv for the dimer forming trajectories at CS = 0.5 M is considerably longer compared to\nCS = 0.15 M, which is also reflected in the average \u27e8\u03c4conv\u27e9 values. The ratio of \u03c4conv obtained at CS = 0.5 M to 0.15 M is \u2248 2.2 for (CAG)30 and \u2248 2.3 for (CAG)31 (Figure S7B and S7C). Our results are in accordance with the experimental observation21,22 that the hairpin\nopening rate strongly depends on the ionic concentrations.\nReduction in strand slippage in scrambled sequences decreases the self-association\npropensity: In order to further illustrate the link between phase behavior of RNA to the\nmonomer characteristics, we calculated the free energy spectra for scrambled sequences whose\nsequence lengths and composition are the same as (CAG)31 but the nucleotide positions are shuffled. We chose two sequences SS1 and SS2. The sequences are given in Figure 4. The\nfree energy spectra at CS = 0.15 M and 0.5 M are given in Figure 4 and Figure S8, respectively. In contrast to the GS of (CAG)31, which has one CAG overhang at the terminal, the GS of the scrambled sequences do not have overhangs. The value of QHP is zero for the GS of both SS1 and SS2. The GS conformations for the sequences are shown in Figure 4B\nand Figure S9. The terminal nucleotides of the scrambled sequences are engaged in the for-\nmation of intramolecular base pairing in the GS conformations, and therefore cannot easily\nself-associate. However, the RNA chains may aggregate by accessing the excited state with\noverhangs. The excited states of the SS1 are devoid of such structures because of the con-\nsecutive array of GC base pair formation at the terminal. We surmise that the propensities\nof SS1 and SS2 to self-associate are small.\nThe absence of multiple peaks in the end-to-end distance distribution (P (Ree)) further supports our conclusion that the sequence SS1 contains overhang(s) neither in the GS nor\nin the excited states (Figure S10A). Based on the free energy spectrum, we predict that\nthe sequence SS1 has the lowest tendency to undergo self-association. In contrast, the first\nexcited state of the SS2 contains an overhang at the terminal of the hairpin structure (Figure\n4B and S10B). The SS2 sequence is, therefore, susceptible to the formation of higher-order\noligomeric structures. However, the propensity to form the oligomers is less compared to\nthe (CAG)31 because of enhancement in the stability of the GS for the scrambled sequence\n(Figure S8). The enhanced stability is also reflected in the distribution of the end-to-end distance (Figure S10B). The P (Ree) value at Ree \u2248 1.45 nm increases significantly as CS increases from 0.5 M from 0.15 M. The value of \u2206GS also increases as CS increases. Because the rate of dimer formation correlates inversely with the free energy gap, we predict that the\nformation of higher-order oligomeric structure in SS2 should decrease substantially as the\nCS is increased relative to the wild-type low complexity sequence.\nUsing the scrambled sequence as a reference, both experiments1 and simulations14 inves-\ntigated the effects of nucleotide position in the sequences in the context of phase separations\nof CAG repeat RNAs. It was shown there is a suppression in the propensity for aggregation\nin the scrambled sequences, which is due to the increase in \u2206GS. Shuffling of the nucleotide positions in the sequence also changes the nature of the free energy spectrum, thus modu-\nlating \u2206GS, which is the single most important determinant of the phase behavior of RNA sequences ."

            "text": "We established a direct link between changes in the monovalent salt concentration on the free\nenergy spectrum of low complexity RNA sequences and their propensities for self-association.\nBy combining counterion condensation theory, with Debye-Huckel potential for the electro-\nstatic interactions, we accounted for the effects of monovalent salts in coarse-grained SIS model23 for RNA. The major finding of our study is that the population of the hairpin state,\ncorresponding to self-association prone conformations, is suppressed for both (CAG)30 and (CAG)31 as CS is increased. The free energy gap, \u2206GS, separating an aggregation-prone hairpin state from an aggregation inactive state, increases with an increase in CS. Strikingly, the mean first passage time (MFPT) for dimer formation increases with \u2206GS. More generally,\nour theory suggests that there is anti-correlation between \u2206GS and rate of RNA association. Because \u2206GS for a given sequence can be altered by changing external conditions, we predict that condensate formation may be drastically changed by tuning temperature and crowding.\nOur result that the dimer formation rate decreases as the salt concentration is increased can\nbe tested experimentally.\nInterestingly, the calculated values of \u2206GS for RNA repeat sequences are similar to the experimentally inferred values for the corresponding DNA sequences. For example, from the\npopulation of low and high FRET states of CAG14 and CAG15 at low salt concentration (see Fig. 2 in Ref.19), we find that \u2206GS \u2248 1.45 kBT . In the RNA repeat sequences value of \u2206GS is \u2248 (1.3 \u2212 2.3) kBT at a higher value of the salt concentration. Just like the DNA trinucleotide repeats the corresponding RNA sequences are dynamic, which results\nin multiple states being sampled. It would be valuable to perform single molecule FRET\nexperiments for low complexity RNA sequences in order to verify some of our findings.\nAn important finding in our study is that \u2206GS increases substantially for the scrambled sequences relative to the repeat sequences. Therefore, we expect that the time for dimeriza-\ntion for the scrambled sequences should be substantially greater for the scrambled sequences. Assuming that the MFPT \u221d exp(\u2212\u2206GS/kBT ),24 we predict that the time for SS2 to dimerize should be roughly ten times greater. Because \u2206GS depends on the precise sequence it follows that from the astronomically large number of sequences (= 3n) it is possible to\nconstruct sequences that would not form condensates at any reasonable external conditions.\nThus, salt-dependent \u2206GS may be used to control aggregation of RNA.\nOur predictions are significant in the cellular context. Physiologically relevant ionic con-\ncentration varies between cells of different species. For instance, the ionic concentration of potassium ion (K+) in budding yeast can reach up to 300 mM25 whereas it is \u2248 150 mM\nin mammalian cells. The free energy spectrum generated for a single RNA molecule in the\npresence of different ionic concentrations could be used as an important tool to regulate the\nphase behavior of RNA-rich condensates."

            "text": "Models: Following our earlier studies,14,15,23 we represent each nucleotide by a single bead. In order to account for counter ion condensation effects,26,27 we used a reduced value of charge -Q (0 < Q < 1) on the bead. In monovalent salt solutions Q = b lB(T ) where, b = 4.4 A\u030a,28 and lB(T ) = e2\n4\u03c0\u03f5(T )kBT , is the Bjerrum length with e being the electron charge, kB\nis the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The T dependence of the dielectric constant29 is \u03f5(T ) = 87.74 - 0.4008T + 9.398\u00d7 10\u22124 T 2 - 1.410\u00d7 10\u22126 T 3, and, T is expressed in \u25e6C unit. The electrostatic repulsion between the beads, accounting for the interactions\nbetween the phosphate groups, is given by,\nEel = Q2e2\n4\u03c0\u03f5(T ) \u2211 i<j exp(\u2212\u03baDrij) rij , (1)\nwhere \u03baD = (8\u03c0\u03c1lB) 1/2, \u03c1 is the number density of the monovalent ions. The total energy in the Single Interaction Site (SIS) model is, ETOT = EB +EHB +EEV +Eel. The detailed functional forms of the bonded (EB), hydrogen bond (EHB), and the excluded volume interactions (EEV ) along with the parameter values are given elsewhere. 15 Although the SIS model is simple, our previous study15 showed that the agreement between the calculated\nand experimentally measured heat capacities for several (CAG)n constructs is very good.\nFree energy spectra: We first calculated the distribution, P (QHP ), of the hairpin order parameter, QHP , which measures the deviation of WC base pairs (GC base pairs in our case) with respect to a perfectly aligned hairpin structure. The QHP order parameter is defined as,\nQHP = [ 1 Nbp Nbp\u2211 i,j (i+ j \u2212NT \u2212 1 3 )2]1/2 , (2)\nwhere i and j are the nucleotides, NT is the sequence length, and Nbp is the number of base pairs in a given conformation. For a perfect hairpin, it is easy to show that i + j =\nNT + 1, implying that QHP = 0. The value of QHP = 1 corresponds to a slipped hairpin, corresponding to one unit of unpaired CAG. Fractional values, 0 < QHP < 1, represent a variety of conformations containing bulges in the stem. The free energies are calculated by\narranging P (QHP ) values in descending order. The spectrum is computed using,\nG(QHP ) = \u2212kBT lnP (QHP ). (3)\nSimulations: The thermodynamic properties, including the free energy spectra, are cal-\nculated using the trajectories generated by integrating the Langevin equation of motion in the low friction limit.30 In order to investigate the formation of aggregates in (CAG)30 and (CAG)31, we performed Brownian dynamics simulations using the Ermack-McCammon algorithm.31 The details are given in the Supplementary Information.\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by a grant from the National Science\nFoundation (CHE 2320256) and the Welch Foundation through the Collie-Welch Chair (F-\n0019).\n0.15 0.25 0.35 0.45 salt concentration (M)\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0 2.2 G S (k B T)\n0.15 0.25 0.35 0.45 salt concentration (M)\n0.5\n0.7\n0.9\n1.1\nM FP\nT (m\ns)\nTOC figure"
