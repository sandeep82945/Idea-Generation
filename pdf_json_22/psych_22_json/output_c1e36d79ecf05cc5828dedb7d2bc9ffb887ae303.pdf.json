    "abstractText": "Background: Two important factors that prolong and exacerbate chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) and disability are low pain self-efficacy and loneliness. Yet, few interventions have shown long-term sustained improvements in pain self-efficacy, and there are no evidence-based treatments that target social connectedness in people living with CNCP. More effective and accessible interventions designed to target self-efficacy and social connectedness could ease the burden of CNCP. Objective: To co-design accessible interventions to increase pain self-efficacy, social connection, pain-related outcomes, and quality of life, this study explored patients\u2019 interest and preferences for digital peer-delivered interventions for CNCP as well as implementation barriers and enablers. Methods: This cross-sectional mixed methods study was part of a larger longitudinal cohort study. Adult Australian residents (N=186) with CNCP diagnosed by a medical professional or pain specialist were included. Participants were initially recruited through advertising on professional pain social media accounts and websites. Questions examined whether patients were interested in digital peer-delivered interventions and their preferences for specific features (eg, Newsfeed). Pain self-efficacy and loneliness were assessed using validated questionnaires, and the association between these factors and interest in digital peer-delivered support was explored. Open-ended questions explored implementation barriers, enablers, and suggestions for consideration in intervention design. Results: There was interest in accessing digital peer-delivered interventions, with almost half of the sample indicating that they would access it if it was available. Those who indicated an interest in digital peer interventions reported both lower pain self-efficacy and greater loneliness than those who were not interested. Intervention content that incorporated education, links to health services and resources, and delivery of support by peer coaches were the most frequently preferred intervention features. Three potential benefits were identified: shared experience, social connection, and shared pain management solutions. Five potential barriers were identified: negative focus on pain, judgment, lack of engagement, negative impact on mental health, privacy and security concerns, and unmet personal preferences. Finally, there were 8 suggestions from participants: moderation of the group, interest JMIR Form Res 2023 | vol. 7 | e41211 | p. 1 https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e41211 (page number not for citation purposes) Yates et al JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH",

Yet, few interventions have shown long-term sustained improvements in pain self-efficacy, and there are no evidence-based treatments that target social connectedness in people living with CNCP. More effective and accessible interventions designed to target self-efficacy and social connectedness could ease the burden of CNCP.\nObjective: To co-design accessible interventions to increase pain self-efficacy, social connection, pain-related outcomes, and quality of life, this study explored patients\u2019 interest and preferences for digital peer-delivered interventions for CNCP as well as implementation barriers and enablers.\nMethods: This cross-sectional mixed methods study was part of a larger longitudinal cohort study. Adult Australian residents (N=186) with CNCP diagnosed by a medical professional or pain specialist were included. Participants were initially recruited through advertising on professional pain social media accounts and websites. Questions examined whether patients were interested in digital peer-delivered interventions and their preferences for specific features (eg, Newsfeed). Pain self-efficacy and loneliness were assessed using validated questionnaires, and the association between these factors and interest in digital peer-delivered support was explored. Open-ended questions explored implementation barriers, enablers, and suggestions for consideration in intervention design.\nResults: There was interest in accessing digital peer-delivered interventions, with almost half of the sample indicating that they would access it if it was available. Those who indicated an interest in digital peer interventions reported both lower pain self-efficacy and greater loneliness than those who were not interested. Intervention content that incorporated education, links to health services and resources, and delivery of support by peer coaches were the most frequently preferred intervention features. Three potential benefits were identified: shared experience, social connection, and shared pain management solutions. Five potential barriers were identified: negative focus on pain, judgment, lack of engagement, negative impact on mental health, privacy and security concerns, and unmet personal preferences. Finally, there were 8 suggestions from participants: moderation of the group, interest\nJMIR Form Res 2023 | vol. 7 | e41211 | p. 1https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e41211 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nsubgroups, professional-led activities, psychological strategies, links to professional pain resources, newsletter, motivational content, live streaming, and online meetups.\nConclusions: Digital peer-delivered interventions were of particular interest to those with CNCP who had lower levels of pain self-efficacy and higher levels of loneliness. Future co-design work could tailor digital peer-delivered interventions to these unmet needs. Intervention preferences and implementation barriers and enablers identified in this study could guide further co-design and the development of such interventions.\n(JMIR Form Res 2023;7:e41211) doi: 10.2196/41211"

            "text": "Neck and low back pain are the leading causes of disability burden in Australia and worldwide [1]. The economic costs of chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) are significant [2] as are the personal costs of concomitant difficulties with day-to-day functioning, loneliness, mental health problems, and overall poor quality of life [3]. Two important factors associated with persistent CNCP and disability are low pain self-efficacy and loneliness [4-7]. More effective and accessible treatments targeted to these modifiable risk and protective factors could better meet the needs of patients and help reduce the increasing burden of CNCP.\nA lack of confidence in carrying out daily activities despite the pain (low pain self-efficacy [8]) more strongly predicts pain disability than other important pain-related factors such as fear-avoidance beliefs [4,9]. Lower pain self-efficacy is also associated with increased use of both pain clinics and emergency departments [10]. Yet, few of the current approaches to improving pain self-efficacy have shown long-term sustained improvements. Meta-analytic evidence from a systematic review of 60 randomized controlled trials (12,415 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain) found that multicomponent, cognitive behavioral, and exercise interventions had small effects on pain self-efficacy at 3 months, and these improvements were not sustained beyond 3 months; self-management interventions were not found to improve pain self-efficacy at any time point [11].\nThe benefits of improved physical and psychological health and longevity that arise from feelings of social connectedness are widely recognized [12,13]. Individuals with stronger social connections have a 50% increased likelihood of survival than those with weaker social connections\u2014so much so that the influence of social connectedness on the risk of death is comparable with well-established risk factors for mortality such as smoking and alcohol use, and exceeds that of physical inactivity and obesity [13]. The related concept of social support, derived from social connections in times of need [12] includes emotional support (eg, care and empathy), appraisal support (eg, being listened to), instrumental support (practical help and getting to and from appointments), and informational support (eg, receiving advice) [14]. For individuals with CNCP, access to social support improves emotional and psychological well-being [15], recovery from co-occurring depression [16],\npain management, coping skills, and an individual\u2019s ability to self-manage their condition [17]. Conversely, the consequences of inadequate social connections and increased loneliness include poorer physical health and lower overall well-being, particularly among those with CNCP [5,18]. But there are very few treatments for CNCP that address the need for social support, and those interventions that provide social support are inaccessible to the majority of people with chronic pain [19].\nPeer-to-peer support presents an opportunity for intervention to improve pain self-efficacy within an environment of collective support [20,21]. Digital group peer support enables users to share common experiences and successes, engage in collective problem-solving, and provide mutual support, which are all important ways to increase self-efficacy [22,23]. In CNCP samples, peer-delivered interventions have shown some positive effects on pain, quality of life, and emotional well-being compared with usual care [24]. A patient\u2019s sense of social connection with the treatment group is also a mechanism of change in chronic pain groups [22]. Beneficial effects of digital or web-based peer-delivered interventions on self-efficacy have also been found across a range of chronic conditions [23]. Co-design of digital peer support interventions could further increase the effectiveness of digital peer-delivered interventions and accelerate translation to clinical practice [25].\nQualitative studies (N=20) [23] illustrate patients\u2019 positive experiences of participating in web-delivered peer support interventions. These experiences include improved compassion and attitude toward living with their condition (eg, patients felt less alone in their difficulties), access to information about treatment options, and an increased sense of empowerment. However, a lack of available time or an inability to access the internet, a sense of not fitting in with the group, and a need for more condition-specific information were described as barriers. Enablers included intervention flexibility, appropriate session length, the usability of the technology, and remote access. Further insights into the barriers and enablers of digital peer support may enhance intervention engagement and adoption particularly to promote pain self-efficacy.\nThis study aimed to examine patient interest in digital peer-delivered interventions for CNCP and potential factors associated with interest (with a focus on pain self-efficacy and loneliness), and explore preferences for peer-delivered support as well as implementation barriers and enablers. It was\nJMIR Form Res 2023 | vol. 7 | e41211 | p. 2https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e41211 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nhypothesized that there would be patient interest in digital peer support interventions for CNCP, but that patients with lower pain self-efficacy and self-reported feelings of loneliness would be particularly interested. Findings will inform the co-design of new and innovative digital peer support interventions to increase pain self-efficacy, pain-related outcomes, and quality of life among those with CNCP."

            "text": "From qualitative reports, there were 3 themes reflecting the potential benefits of digital peer support interventions: shared experiences, social connection, and shared pain management solutions. Table 5 provides a description of each theme identified and an example quote. Some participants suggested that they would benefit from the shared experience of CNCP and the ease of relating to others like them: \u201cI think having people that understand the circumstances or what you go through each day would be beneficial.\u201d\nSome participants reported that digital peer support could provide an opportunity for social connection, which may help with \u201cNot feeling alone.\u201d It could also provide an avenue for shared practical pain management solutions. This could involve problem-solving discussions as well as encouraging, motivating, and supporting each other to achieve goals: \u201cFind things that have been helpful to others. From my experience of managing pain, I could perhaps help others who are struggling.\u201d\nSix themes reflected the potential barriers of peer support: negative focus on pain, judgement, lack of engagement, negative impact on mental health, privacy and security concerns, and unmet personal preferences. There were examples of how digital peer support may result in a negative focus on pain: \u201cEveryone's pain is different, and I would become irritated by all the whinging.\u201d\nParticipants were also concerned about judgment from others, and how it may create a competitive environment where people want to compare their experiences to others: \u201cI would hate for it to be that people are trying to one up each other or believe that they are in more pain than someone else.\u201d\nSome reported personal and situational factors that could limit their engagement in digital peer support, including restricted access, limited time, and competing demands: \u201cBeing able to offer help when I feel I can't be reliable.\u201d\nPossible negative impacts on mental health were also reported including potential development or exacerbation of depression and anxiety symptoms: \u201cI feel I would be taking other people's problems on board as well as my own and end up worrying about them as well as myself.\u201d\nConcerns about privacy and security of information in a digital forum were considered a barrier by some participants. Personal preferences for in-person connection could also be a barrier as some people prefer face-to-face rather than digital communication: \u201cI haven't always found online groups very helpful as it feels isolating never having met the people and it also feels risky.\u201d\nEight additional suggestions from participants were identified and are summarized in Textbox 1.

            "text": "The aim of this study was to examine interest in digital peer support interventions for CNCP, the role of pain self-efficacy and loneliness, and preferences for both content and delivery features. We also explored potential benefits, barriers, and suggestions for digital peer supported interventions. Our findings showed that there was interest in accessing digital peer-delivered interventions, with almost half of the sample indicating that they would access it if it was available. As expected, those who indicated interest in digital peer interventions reported both lower pain self-efficacy and greater loneliness than those who were not interested. Intervention content that incorporated education and links to health services and resources as well as delivery of support by peer coaches were the most frequently preferred intervention features. Three potential benefits were identified: shared experience, social connection, and shared pain management solutions. Five potential barriers were identified: negative focus on pain, judgment, lack of engagement, negative impact on mental health, privacy and security concerns, and unmet personal preferences. Finally, there were 8 suggestions from participants: moderation of the group, interest subgroups, professional-led activities, psychological strategies, links to professional pain resources, newsletter, motivational content, live streaming, and web-based meetups.\nInterest in digital peer support was related to participants\u2019 level of pain self-efficacy. Those who were less confident in managing day-to-day despite pain were more likely to be\ninterested in accessing a digital peer support intervention. Low pain self-efficacy is a stronger predictor of pain-related disability than other psychological factors [4,9]. By contrast, higher pain self-efficacy is protective. It was found to be one of the only psychological factors assessed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that predicted less disability post pandemic [33]. Participants reported that digital peer support interventions could promote pain self-efficacy. For example, shared pain management solutions included understanding how others manage daily tasks and sharing strategies for dealing with pain. These experiences may also provide opportunities for accessing informational support (eg, receiving advice). That is, participants viewed the intervention as a way to access new ideas and solutions for problems they were facing, in particular, from the perspective of those who are living with CNCP and who have personal experience of applying strategies in their own lives. Sharing lived experiences as part of digital peer-delivered interventions may be valuable not only for connecting with others but also for solution-focused strategies and empowered pain management, which could increase confidence in managing daily activities despite the pain. Interestingly, similar experiences were found in focus groups with participants in a face-to-face loneliness intervention (\u201cGroups 4 Health\u201d); the experience of collective problem-solving was nominated as one of the main things people valued about the program [34].\nThose who reported higher levels of loneliness were more likely to be interested in accessing a digital peer-delivered intervention. This finding suggests that some individuals with CNCP have an unmet need for social connection. Participants highlighted that digital peer interventions could meet this need, providing\nJMIR Form Res 2023 | vol. 7 | e41211 | p. 9https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e41211 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\na feeling of not being alone and a sense of \u201ccommunity.\u201d Suggestions by participants for opportunities to connect with others who share common interests such as hobbies may support involvement in meaningful activities and contribute to a positive sense of self. It may also be that through this social connection they develop a \u201crecovery identity\u201d within the group that is collectively empowering [20].\nParticipants reported a high level of interest in receiving support from peer coaches. The role of peers in peer-delivered interventions can take many forms (eg, peer counselor, peer educator, peer support, peer case manager, and peer facilitator [35]). For people with CNCP, inclusion of peers in a peer coaching facilitator role may be particularly beneficial. Peer coaches are responsible for strengthening relationships between and among individuals that support them to set and achieve goals together [35]. It is possible that peer coaches provide a source of lived experience of recovery, offering patients hope for living a rich and meaningful life even with CNCP. Participants indicated a preference for inspirational or motivational content from peers, which suggests that peers can play not only a supportive role but act as role models for one another. More research is needed to determine if peer coaches enhance intervention engagement and effectiveness.\nA preference for educational content and links to health services was found. Digital peer-delivered interventions could be well positioned to increase awareness of available resources and services as a \u201cresource-hub.\u201d Studies have shown that when peers adopt an educator role, intervention engagement can be improved [35]. Details on the preferred delivery of educational content included recommendations for live-streamed/digital group meet ups including professionally delivered group activities and talks delivered by experts. There was support for health professional guidance as part of peer-delivered interventions, including psychological strategies to improve coping skills. When therapist support is included as part of digital interventions, this has a positive impact on engagement and treatment effectiveness [36]. Future research could explore blended peer- and professional-led digital peer support interventions.\nOn average, approximately half of all participants indicated interest in each of the content and delivery features. However, there was overall less interest in a private chat function and completing questionnaires with feedback. Further investigation of specific preferences and how they may or may not be beneficial could guide how best to design and implement them. Providing options for digital (eg, mobile app) personalization may allow users to tailor aspects of the intervention to their specific needs and preferences. For example, participants may be able to opt out of the newsfeed function while still accessing the digital workshops or talks delivered by professionals. The degree of adaptability may increase the acceptability and usability of digital peer-supported interventions.\nOur results suggest some participants may have been unsure of their interest in digital peer support. That is, a proportion of individuals who indicated a lack of interest in the broad idea of an intervention nevertheless indicated an interest in some of the proposed content and delivery features. It is possible that\nparticipants were initially unsure of their interest as relatively limited information about the digital peer support intervention was provided. For example, one participant commented, \u201cRather than yes/no \u2013 unsure \u2013 would depend on the group and group dynamics.\u201d With further information about the intervention and context, it is possible that a greater number of individuals may be interested. Future research could explore any possible ambivalence. Supplementing web-based questionnaires with individual interviews and focus groups may also assist in exploring these issues. These findings may also indicate consensus on the needs of the CNCP community irrespective of personal interest in an intervention. This was evident in some of the responses provided by participants: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be interested\u2026however, I think they are good for people that need them\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t (know) whether I\u2019d want to talk about chronic pain problems with others, I prefer to only talk about it with my GP. I think it is person(al) preference.\u201d Seeking the perspectives of those who are not personally interested may elicit information relevant to the community at large and may also serve the function of supporting others.\nA prominent barrier identified by participants was the potential negative impact of participating in a CNCP digital peer support intervention may have on mental health and well-being. This was a genuine concern. Studies have found a negative impact of exposure to the pain of others (vicarious pain) on pain outcomes [37]. Exposure to threatening information about pain is associated with reduced use of cognitive coping strategies [38]. It will be important to ensure patient safety in digital peer-delivered intervention groups. It is likely that professionalor peer-led involvement including moderation as suggested by participants could mitigate these concerns. To address the barrier of a possibly negative focus on pain, there was a suggestion for motivational or inspirational content on living with pain. The recommendation for inspirational or motivational stories from others living with pain may be beneficial for improving pain outcomes, as optimism and hope are associated with a positive adjustment to CNCP among other positive outcomes [39-41].\nRecent reviews of patient-targeted mobile apps for pain self-management found that key stakeholders, including patients and health care professionals are not routinely engaged in the design of digital health interventions [42-44]. In this project, we advanced co-design of digital peer-delivered interventions to improve pain self-efficacy and social connectedness by examining both patient interest and their perspectives on intervention preferences as well as barriers and enablers to implementation in practice. Our study adds to the growing literature on co-design in digital health interventions [45] and extends research into the CNCP field.\nWe included a community sample of 186 patients. While there are no guidelines on the minimum number of key stakeholders or frequency/intensity of engagement that is needed in co-design, it is possible that our results may not generalize to the broader CNCP population or beyond the Australian context where patients have access to a relatively high standard of public health care. Continual and increased engagement of treatment-seeking patients in the subsequent steps of co-design and co-development of digital peer-delivered interventions could increase the customizability of the solution, to fit a wider range\nJMIR Form Res 2023 | vol. 7 | e41211 | p. 10https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e41211 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nof users. We used yes or no questions to assess interest in a digital peer support intervention and its specific features. Future research may benefit from exploring nuanced perspectives by using continuous Likert scales to rate interest, or an additional response option of \u201cUnsure.\u201d Inclusion of additional qualitative methods (eg, interviews) may enrich the co-design process. In particular, further exploration of the goals that individuals would like to achieve may assist in tailoring intervention design to meet both their needs and enhance motivational factors. We examined 2 factors that were potentially associated with interest in digital peer-delivered interventions. There may be additional relevant factors, however, such as treatment expectations and related social connectedness concepts (eg, social group memberships [46]) that may influence patient interest. These require further consideration in future research.\nParticipants were recruited through advertisements on professional pain social media accounts and websites. The sampling method targeted people who had access to and were current users of the internet and social media. It is not clear whether interest in digital peer support interventions varies for those who may not be actively engaged in social media or currently have limited use of or access to the internet. Their perspectives could offer additional insights into the possible barriers and enablers to accessing digital social interventions. This study did not assess the participants\u2019 level of digital literacy. Examining individuals\u2019 skill or confidence in use of digital platforms may inform the design and impact of these\ndigital interventions\u2014for example, the level of support for technical questions or issues, or the relevance of tutorials or demonstrations. Future studies could also explore tailoring of peer support interventions for culturally and linguistically diverse populations. Social media sites can provide speech to text, translate text, as well as other accessibility modifications. Assessing the need for these features could be incorporated into the co-design process. Ensuring equitable access to digital social interventions is an important consideration in future work."

Patients were interested in digital peer-delivered interventions, and patients with lower pain self-efficacy and loneliness were more interested. It is possible that digital peer-delivered interventions tailored to these unmet needs may be beneficial in reducing the burden of living with CNCP. We identified preferences for intervention content and process of delivery as well as barriers and enablers, which could guide the future development of such programs. The next phases of co-design involves the generation of design concepts and prototyping [47]. Adopting a co-design approach has the potential to better address the needs of patients with CNCP, enhance translation of personalized digital peer-delivered interventions into practice and improve clinical effectiveness."
