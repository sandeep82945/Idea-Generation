    "abstractText": "The efficacies and toxicities of chiral drug enantiomers are often dissimilar, necessitating chiral recognition methods. Herein, a polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework was used to prepare molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as sensors with enhanced specific recognition capabilities for levo-lansoprazole. The properties of the MIP sensor were investigated using Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical methods. The optimal sensor performance was achieved by applying self-assembly times of 30.0 and 25.0 min for the complex framework and levo-lansoprazole, respectively, eight electropolymerization cycles with o-phenylenediamine as the functional monomer, an elution time of 5.0 min using an ethanol/acetic acid/H2O mixture (2/3/8, V/V/V) as the eluent, and a rebound time of 10.0 min. A linear relationship was observed between the sensor response intensity (\u2206I) and logarithm of the levo-lansoprazole concentration (l-g C) in the range of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221213\u20133.0 \u00d7 10\u221211 mol/L. Compared with a conventional MIP sensor, the proposed sensor showed more efficient enantiomeric recognition, with high selectivity and specificity for levolansoprazole. The sensor was successfully applied to levo-lansoprazole detection in enteric-coated lansoprazole tablets, thus demonstrating its suitability for practical applications.",

            "text": "Chirality [1] is a widely observed phenomenon in nature and an inherent feature of the molecular and macromolecular components of organisms, including tissues, cells, proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides. Owing to its universality and significance, substantial research efforts have been directed towards studying various aspects of chirality, and the application of chiral drugs is an important trend in the field of medicine. From a pharmacological perspective, generally, only one enantiomer of chiral drugs is medicinally important, whereas the other is not effective and may even exhibit toxic side effects [2]. Therefore, analytical methods that differentiate chiral drug enantiomers are important [3]. Based on the regulations established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1992 [4], for drugs containing chiral centers, the physical and chemical properties of each enantiomer must be determined. If the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers are dissimilar, the linear relationship between their respective doses and any interaction effects between the metabolites and the drug should be established. The toxicity and side effects of each enantiomer must be determined to prevent possible harmful effects within the human body. The chiral drug regulations of the FDA, as well as the corresponding European regulations, promote the development of single-enantiomer drugs. Therefore, research on the detection of chiral drug enantiomers can have far-reaching implications for clinical applications and improving rational drug use.\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 509. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios13050509 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nLansoprazole [5] is a proton-pump inhibitor that is mainly used for the treatment of duodenal ulcers, reflux esophagitis, and gastric ulcers. Furthermore, it has been recognized as a new type of drug for the treatment of breast tumors [6]. Owing to the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the S atom in its structure, lansoprazole exists as a pair of chiral enantiomers. Although both l- and d-isomers exhibit therapeutic effects, dexlansoprazole is more effective than levo-lansoprazole [7]. Currently, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [8] and HPLC\u2013mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) are predominantly used for the detection of levo-lansoprazole [9,10]. However, these methods require expensive instrumentation, lengthy operation times, and cannot be used for real-time analyses. Therefore, the development of rapid chiral separation methods featuring excellent selectivity and high sensitivity is essential. Molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) sensors [11\u201313] prepared using molecular imprinting technology (MIT) [14] are well-known for their advantageous features, including structural predictability and recognition specificity. The molecular imprinting technique involves the synthesis of a polymer in the presence of a target molecule as a template, resulting in the formation of molecular recognition sites in the polymer. During polymerization, the complementary interactions between the functional monomer and target molecule are maintained; this spatial arrangement can be further stabilized via polymer crosslinking. Therefore, the generated MIP sensors can selectively recognize the target analyte via the template-derived sites [15,16]. MIP sensors have been applied to chiral separation for many years, and their use in the field of medicine continues to increase [17\u201320]. However, in practice, conventional MIP sensors display poor separation and recognition capabilities, often recognizing substances that are structurally similar to the target molecule; moreover, their stability is relatively low [21]. To address these shortcomings, a rapid detection method that allows for highly efficient separation and recognition is required. In this study, to improve sensor selectivity, a polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework was used to prepare the MIPs. Owing to its highly ordered three-dimensional (3D) structure, the framework anchored the spatial conformation of the target molecule while simultaneously improving the structural fineness of the imprinted pores to increase the number of recognition sites. Using levo-lansoprazole as the target molecule and o-phenylenediamine as the functional monomer, and MIP capable of highly selective molecular conformation recognition was constructed via electropolymerization. The subsequent elution of levo-lansoprazole delivered a chiral MIP sensor bearing complementary imprinted pores that matched the spatial conformation, size, and structure of levo-lansoprazole. Owing to these recognition sites, the sensor exhibited high selectivity and specificity for levo-lansoprazole upon re-adsorption. The recognition mechanism is illustrated in Figure 1.

As illustrated in Figure 2A, the reduction peak current of the electrode modified with the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework (curve b) was significantly lower than that of the bare gold electrode (curve a). The distinction occurred, because the complex framework hindered electron transfer to a certain extent. Following levo-lansoprazole self-assembly on the electrode, the response signal decreased further (curve c). Levolansoprazole contains three F atoms, which can form hydrogen bonds with the H atoms of the \u2013NH groups in the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine framework, thereby immobilizing levolansoprazole onto the framework and further hindering electron transfer.

Chiral Separation Effcienct To study the chiral separation efficiency of the MIP sensor fabricated using the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework, its performance was compared with that of a conventional MIP sensor for the recognition of levo-lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, and their racemate at a concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 mol/L. The results for the conventional MIP sensor are shown in Figure 6A, where the DPV response of the bare gold electrode is given by curve a. The conventional MIP sensor exhibited responses for both levo-lansoprazole (curve b) and dexlansoprazole (curve c); the response signal intensity for the racemate (curve d) was greater than half that of the levo-lansoprazole response at the same concentration. Since the imprinted pores formed by conventional methods are unstable and have a lower precision than those formed using the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework, the presence of enantiomers can interfere with the recognition process to a greater extent. The recognition efficiency of the MIP sensor prepared using the polylysine\u2013 phenylalanine complex is shown in Figure 6B. This sensor showed a relatively strong response signal intensity for levo-lansoprazole, whereas the signal intensity for dexlansoprazole was only 3.33% that of the levo-lansoprazole response. This result indicates that the developed MIP sensor exhibited specific recognition for the target molecule. Since the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework provided multiple recognition sites for the target molecules, the spatial conformation was better maintained, thereby improving the precision of the imprinted pores and reducing the interference from the other enantiomers during recognition."

The conventional MIP sensor exhibited responses for both levo-lansoprazole (curve b) and dexlansoprazole (curve c); the response signal intensity for the racemate (curve d) was greater than half that of the levo-lansoprazole response at the same concentration. Since the imprinted pores formed by conventional methods are unstable and have a lower precision than those formed using the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework, the presence of enantiomers can interfere with the recognition process to a greater extent.

Sensitivities of (A) the conventional MIP sensor and (B) MIP sensor fabricated using the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework.\n3.7. Stability, Reproducibility, and Shelf Life After five consecutive measurements of a levo-lansoprazole solution (1.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 mol/L) with the MIP sensor, a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 3.5%was obtained, reflecting the favorable stability of the sensor. Analyses of a levo-lansoprazole solution (1.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 mol/L) using five sensors prepared using the same method in the same batch gave an RSD of 3.9%, indicating good reproducibility. Sensors prepared in the same batch were stored in a refrigerator for five days and then used to analyze a levo-lansoprazole solution (1.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 mol/L) five consecutive times. No significant changes in the signal intensity were observed; however, after storage for 10 days, the signal intensity decreased by an average of 7.8%. These results indicate that the MIP sensor has a relatively long shelf life.\n3.8. Anti-Interference Ability of the Sensor The anti-interference ability of the prepared MIP sensor was studied using substances with molecular structures similar to that of levo-lansoprazole. Rebinding experiments were performed using LSF, LSO, LNO, OMP, and RBP at a concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22129 mol/L. The recognition capabilities of the sensor for these interfering substances were compared with that for the target molecule levo-lansoprazole. As shown in Figure 7, the maximum response signal intensity among the interference substances was only 3.00% of the signal intensity for levo-lansoprazole, indicating that the sensor had low recognition ability for the interfering substances. These results clearly demonstrate that the MIP sensor exhibited specific recognition ability for the target molecule.\nFigure 6. Sensitivities of (A) the conventional MIP sensor and (B) MIP sensor fabricated using the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework.\nThe recognition efficiency of the MIP sensor prepared using the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex is shown in Figure 6B. This sensor showed a relatively strong response signal intensity for levo-lansoprazole, whereas the signal intensity for dexlansoprazole was only 3.33% that of the levo-lansoprazole response. This result indicates that the developed MIP sensor exhibited specific recognition for the target molecule. Since the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework provided multiple recognition sites for the target molecules, the spatial conformation was better maintained, thereby improving the precision of the imprinted pores and reducing the interference from the other enantiomers during recognition."

Real Sample Detection Using a rebinding time of 10 min, the DPV response for the MIP sensor was measured for the sample solutions prepared using enteric-coated lansoprazole tablets and human serum samples. The accuracy of the sensor was assessed using the standard addition recovery method. The recovery rate of levo-lansoprazole in the sample was between 96.4% and 102.8% (Table 1), indicating the successful detection of levo-lansoprazole in enteric-coated lansoprazole tablets and in turn demonstrating the practical applicability of this sensor for the analysis of real samples. \u2212\n4. Conclusions In this study, a polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex was introduced during the preparation of the MIP sensors. The self-assembled framework of the polylysine\u2013 phenylalanine complex was employed to immobilize the target molecule, levo-lansoprazole, through hydrogen bonding. Owing to its highly ordered 3D structure, the polylysine\u2013phenylalanine complex framework anchored the spatial conformation of the target molecule and improved the structural fineness of the imprinted pores, which increased the number of recognition sites and enhanced the specific recognition ability of the sensor. The excellent performance of the proposed MIP sensor in the analysis of real samples indicates its significant potential for practical applications. As the sensor is not restricted by the structure of the target molecule, this approach can serve as a novel platform for the separation and recognition of chiral drugs.\nFigure 7.
