1. **Investigate the impact of instructor embodiment on gender differences in the instructor presence effect.** The current study found that females spent more time attending to the instructor's video compared to males. However, the instructor in this study did not exhibit salient social cues such as facial expressions, body orientation, and gestures. Future research could examine whether gender differences in attention allocation and learning outcomes are more pronounced when the instructor is presented with high embodiment social cues.


2. **Explore the role of prior knowledge and topic familiarity in gender differences in the instructor presence effect.** The current study found that participants self-reported being generally unfamiliar with the topics covered in the study. Future research could use a prior knowledge test to gauge participants' pre-existing knowledge of each topic accurately. This would help to determine whether prior knowledge and topic familiarity moderate the gender differences observed in the current study.


3. **Examine the impact of instructor presence on gender differences in learning transfer.** The current study only tested participants' retention for assessment of learning. Future research should include a transfer test to see how well learners understand the material. This would help to determine whether males and females differ in transferring what they have learned from video lectures with (or without) the instructor's presence.


4. **Investigate the relationship between gender differences in attention allocation and learning outcomes in instructor-present video lectures.** The current study found that females spent more time attending to the instructor's video compared to males, but both genders achieved similar learning outcomes. Future research could use mediation analysis to examine whether attention allocation mediates the relationship between instructor presence and learning outcomes. This would help to determine whether the gender differences in attention allocation observed in the current study contribute to the gender differences in learning outcomes.


5. **Explore the impact of instructor gender on gender differences in the instructor presence effect.** The current study only included a female instructor. Future research could examine whether the gender of the instructor moderates the gender differences observed in the current study. This would help to determine whether the instructor presence effect is influenced by the gender of the instructor.
