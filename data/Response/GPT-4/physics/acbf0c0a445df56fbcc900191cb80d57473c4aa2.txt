Extension to Multi-component Distillation Columns: The research focused on a binary methanol-water separation column. Future work could extend this approach to multi-component distillation columns, which are common in industrial applications but present a more complex challenge due to the increased number of products and potential interactions. Investigating the efficacy of inferential ADRC with dynamic soft sensors in such systems could significantly impact energy efficiency and operational costs in a broader range of industrial processes.

Integration with Real-time Optimization (RTO): While the paper focuses on control performance enhancement through inferential ADRC, integrating this control scheme with real-time optimization strategies could further improve overall process efficiency. Future research could explore how dynamic PCR model predictions could be utilized within an RTO framework to dynamically adjust operational parameters, not just for control stability but also for optimal energy use and product quality.

Development of Nonlinear Soft Sensors: The research utilized static and dynamic PCR models for soft sensor development. There's potential in exploring nonlinear soft sensor models, such as those based on artificial neural networks or support vector machines, to capture the complex nonlinearities of distillation processes better. Such models could potentially offer improved estimation accuracy and control performance under a wider range of operating conditions.

Adaptation to Batch Distillation Processes: The current study focused on continuous distillation processes. Future research could adapt the inferential ADRC approach to batch distillation operations, which are widely used in specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals manufacturing. Batch processes present unique challenges, such as varying feed composition and batch cycle optimization, where dynamic control strategies could offer significant benefits in terms of yield and purity.

Robustness and Uncertainty Analysis: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under simulated conditions, future research could delve into robustness and uncertainty analysis. Investigating how the inferential ADRC scheme performs under measurement noise, unmodeled dynamics, and parameter uncertainties could provide insights into its applicability in real-world industrial environments, paving the way for strategies to enhance the robustness and reliability of the control system.
