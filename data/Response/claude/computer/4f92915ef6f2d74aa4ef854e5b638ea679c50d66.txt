 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper:

1. Explore different neural network architectures for the ranker module in the retriever-ranker framework. The paper uses a simple feedforward network, but more complex architectures like convolutional neural networks could potentially improve performance.

2. Investigate different pretraining objectives and tasks to better optimize the code PLMs for the downstream task of code search. The pretraining phase is key for transferring knowledge to downstream tasks.

3. Study how to effectively apply the retriever-ranker framework to other code intelligence tasks beyond code search, such as code summarization, code generation, and code translation.

4. Design algorithms to automatically find the optimal hyperparameter values like the number of retrieved codes k, rather than setting them manually. This could improve optimization and adaptability.

5. Conduct user studies to evaluate satisfaction with the system's response time and relevance of results. This could provide insights for balancing performance versus efficiency.
