We demonstrate that fast high-fidelity transport can be achieved using protocols designed with differentiable programming. Building on this, we then show how this approach can be effectively adapted to control a disordered quantum system. We consider two settings: optimal control for a known unwanted disorder pattern, i.e., a specific disorder realisation, and optimal control where only the statistical properties of disorder are known, i.e., optimizing for high average fidelities. In the former, disorder effects can be effectively mitigated for an appropriately chosen control protocol. However, in the latter setting the average fidelity can only be marginally improved, suggesting the presence of a fundamental lower bound.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043138\nI. INTRODUCTION\nRobust, implementable control protocols are a necessary ingredient for many quantum devices. A particularly relevant task is the routing of quantum states and information over large distances [1,2] and/or across a network of connected quantum registers [3,4]. The use of spin chains with short-range Heisenberg interactions to transmit quantum information presents a viable framework to accomplish this goal [5], applicable to a wide range of experimental platforms [6\u201310]. This task can be achieved via the use of an external magnetic field with a parabolic spatial profile which is adiabatically swept across the chain [11] alleviating the need for precise control over individual couplings [12]. However, a notable drawback is that such adiabatic protocols are inherently slow and, hence, susceptible to noise from the environment. This observation precipitated the development of nonadiabatic protocols, such as analytically derived shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) [13] and quantum optimal control methods [14\u201327].\nAlthough these approaches have been successfully applied in several settings, there remain drawbacks, for instance, shortcut-to-adiabaticity approaches, such as the one employed in Ref. [13], often rely on simple model descriptions and/or approximations.

Differential programming is an approach which is widely used in the context of deep learning [30] and has been recently applied in various quantum control setups, such as the transport of Majorana zero modes [31], the control of thermal machines [32], numerical renormalization group [33], and interacting qubits [34]. The main advantage of \u2202P is that it allows to efficiently obtain the required gradients [35], making gradient-based optimization of complex quantum many-body problems computationally tractable.\nWe use \u2202P with several different ansatzes drawn from other traditional quantum control methods, specifically the shortcutto-adiabaticity protocol [13] and a finite Fourier basis inspired by the chopped random basis (CRAB) protocol [17]. A common difficulty which must be overcome is the inevitability of noise or imperfections in experimentally realized systems in form of spatial heterogeneities, i.e., disorder. For sufficiently large disorder, the system\u2019s state tends to exponentially localize [36] and, thus, hinders transport of the state across the system. We establish that the presence of disorder is, in and of itself, not a limiting factor in achieving high-fidelity control in the system with \u2202P strategies able to find a suitable control pulse efficiently. The drawback, however, is that the \u2202P gradients implicitly depend on the exact disorder pattern, which, therefore, must be known. In the absence of this information, for a disordered-averaged gradient, we find that even with a high degree of optimization, there is little advantage gained over applying the best disorder-free protocols.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the subsequent section we outline the model and the state transfer goal. Then in Sec. III we introduce the various approaches\n2643-1564/2022/4(4)/043138(10) 043138-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nused to design the dynamical control field. Following this, we demonstrate and compare the effectiveness of these methods for a clean (i.e., disorder-free) system in Sec. IV. These methods are then adapted in Sec. V to a disordered system. Finally, in Sec. VI we summarize our paper and provide some outlook on future directions."

We can divide the Hilbert space into separate disconnected sectors, each with a fixed total number of spin excitations S = \u3008Sz\u3009.

Freely propagating magnons, i.e., without a confining magnetic-field Bn, disperse over time throughout the chain. Therefore, an initially localized wave packet will delocalize across the chain as a direct result of the nonlinear dispersion relation [37]. To counteract this spreading it is necessary to guide the magnon transport [11,38] by imposing the external magnetic-field Bn(t ). Various kinds of magnetic traps with different spatial profiles can be used for\nthis, such as the P\u00f6schl-Teller [39] potential, a square well [37], or a harmonic trap [11].\nMotivated by the correspondence with the single-particle Hamiltonian in Eq.

(4)\nX0(t ) is the position of the minimum of the trap, which will serve as our control parameter. This influences the position of the magnon. This functional form allows us to exploit known analytic optimal control pulses derived with STA methods [13,40]. Note that we fix the lattice spacing as x = 1 hereafter.\nFor our magnon transport problem we initialize the parameters, such that we have a Gaussian wave packet,\n|\u03c8A\u3009 = 1\u221a\u2211 n c2n(xA)\n\u2211 n cn(xA)|n\u3009 (5)\ncentered at a position xA in the chain with cn(x) = exp [\u2212(n \u2212 x)2/2\u03c3 2].

This target state is the same magnon but now localized at a position xB =xA + d with transport distance d . Note that xA, xB are chosen sufficiently far from the boundaries to avoid any finite-size effects.\nThe efficacy of our magnon transport protocol, parametrized by X0(t ), can be quantified by the infidelity,\nI\u03c4 = 1 \u2212 |\u3008\u03c8B|U (\u03c4 )|\u03c8A\u3009|2.

This infidelity I\u03c4 forms the objective function which we minimize with respect to X0(t ) to obtain the optimal transport control pulses. We remark that this objective function must be slightly adapted for the case of a disordered system as explained in Sec. V."

            "text": "Here, we briefly recapitulate the main idea of Ref. [13] which forms the basis for the STA protocol ansatz we will employ. We derive optimal control protocols for a particle in a harmonic trap Eq. (3) with the inverse engineering method based on Lewis-Riesenfeld (LR) invariants. As demonstrated in Ref. [13], the approximate correspondence with the singlespin excitation Hamiltonian H allows these protocols to be highly effective for the magnon transport in a Heisenberg chain.\nIn order to apply the inverse engineering STA method we need to find a suitable dynamical invariant I (t ), which is a time-dependent Hermitian operator that satisfies \u2202I (t )\n\u2202t + i[Hc(t ), I (t )] = 0. For the single particle in a harmonic trap with Hamiltonian,\nHc(t ) = k 2 2m + 1 2 m\u03c920[x \u2212 X0(t )]2, (9)\na quadratic in momentum LR invariant [40,41] is given by\nI (t ) = 1 2m (k \u2212 m\u03b1\u0307)2 + 1 2 m\u03c920(x \u2212 \u03b1)2. (10)\nThe time-dependent function \u03b1\u2261\u03b1(t ) must satisfy \u03b1\u0308 + \u03c920[\u03b1 \u2212 X0(t )] = 0, (11)\nto ensure dI/dt = 0. To find optimal transport protocols for the harmonic trap we require that the initial and final eigenstates of I (t ) match with the initial |\u03c8A\u3009 and target states |\u03c8B\u3009 of our control problem. This can be achieved by imposing [I\u03c4 (0), H\u03c4 (0)]= [I (\u03c4 ), H (\u03c4 )]=0 which results in the following additional boundary conditions:\n\u03b1(0) = xA, \u03b1(\u03c4 ) = xB, d n\u03b1\ndtn \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 t=0,\u03c4 = 0 (12)\nfor n = 1, 2. The final shortcut protocol solutions for X0(t ) are then obtained by solving the invariant equations, Eq. (11) with an arbitrary function \u03b1(t ) that satisfies these boundary conditions. In practice we can pick any function \u03b1(t ) which fulfill the required boundary conditions, however, as part of a hybrid \u2202P approach, we will parametrize a specific subset of this family of solutions as outlined in the following subsection. Note that this formalism can be extended to include a time-dependent frequency."

            "text": "To optimize the transport of the wave packet in the clean system, i.e., in the absence of disorder, we minimize the infidelity with gradient-based optimization algorithms. For this we obtain the gradient of the infidelity with respect to the control parameters dI\u03c4dX0(t ) with differentiable programming [30]. This is achieved by writing the code for the infidelity I\u03c4 in the PYTHON library JAX [42] and exploiting its automatic differentiation feature. Due to the use of backpropagation (widely used in deep learning [43]), the gradient can be obtained very efficiently with similar computational complexity as forward evaluation of the infidelity [44,45]. This allows us to use many different control parameters and to have flexibility in the design of the cost functional, for example, allowing for the addition of penalty terms and the use of neural networks [31,34].\nThe gradient can be used in specific optimization algorithms, which we will also refer to as update schemes. The simplest is traditional gradient descent (GD) where the control parameters are updated according to X i+10 =X i0 \u2212 \u03bc\u2207X0Ii\u03c4 for each iteration i of the learning algorithm. The hyperparameter \u03bc is known as the learning rate and must be set manually before optimization. It is common practice to use specific decay schedules for \u03bc. We empirically determine an approximation to the optimal learning rate by scanning over a range of values from 10\u22124 to 101 and choose the value of \u03bc corresponding to the lower value of infidelity. Another, more elaborate, update scheme we employ is known under the acronym ADAM [46] and makes, among other things, use of an adaptive momentum of the learning rate. We find that this generally leads to faster convergence to the optimal protocols.\nWe will first consider the setting where no additional information or knowledge about the problem is used to constrain the control protocols; it starts from a random or linear protocol, and we refer to this as \u2202P free. This approach is useful for finding new unexpected protocols, for example, the jumpmove-jump protocol in Ref. [31] since the learning is not influenced by potential human biases, see also Ref. [47]. A clear drawback is that it can be computationally expensive to find an optimal protocol in the large unconstrained and possibly nonconvex optimization landscape. Specifically, we discretize the control into M-individual time bins X0(t ) \u2192 [X0(t1), X0(t2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 X0(tM )] of time-width t =\u03c4/M and we define tn = n t [48]. The optimization task now reduces to finding the values for each X0(tn) that minimize I\u03c4 .\nFollowing from the demonstrations that hybrid control approaches can be highly effective [13,49,50], we consider the performance of protocols which combine \u2202P and other control methods to constrain the size of the search space. In particular,\n043138-3\nwe consider a \u201c\u2202P-STA\u201d approach where we use the analytical control pulses provided by the mapping between the single excitation spin chain and the single particle as seeds for the optimization. With GD we then search over the restricted class of STA protocols which generally allows for a very fast optimization, however, as we will see, due to the restricted search space this approach may fail where others are still effective.\nFor this hybrid approach, in what follows, we define two control parameters C1 = X0(\u03c4/4) and C2 = X0(3\u03c4/4), which correspond to the positions of the trap at times \u03c4/4 and 3\u03c4/4, and obtain their derivatives \u2202I\n\u2202C1 and \u2202I \u2202C2 with \u2202P. We remark\nthat this can be generalized to an arbitrary number of control parameters without any significant additional computational cost for \u2202P. C1 and C2 can be used as control parameters by imposing them as additional constraints when solving the polynomial for \u03b1(t ) in Eq. (11). The advantages are that imposing the STA protocol constraints need only be performed once and the resulting fixed polynomial of C1 and C2 can be implemented as a differentiable function for \u2202P. We consider the minimal polynomial \u03b1(t )=\u22117n=1 bntn that satisfies the boundary conditions Eq. (12) and fixes the values C1 and C2. This gives a whole family of STA protocols for X0(t ) in which each member corresponds to a specific configuration of the expansion coefficients bn.\nThe final ansatz that we use we term \u201c\u2202P Fourier\u201d, where we aim to combine differentiable programming with optimal control based on a truncated Fourier basis and inspired by the CRAB ansatz [17,51\u201353]. Specifically, to fulfill the boundary conditions X0(0) = xA and X0(\u03c4 ) = xB, we define the Fourier ansatz to be the family of protocols parametrized as\nX0(t ) = xA + (xB \u2212 xA) t \u03c4\n+ Nc\u2211\nn=1 An sin \u03c9nt . (13)\nThe control parameters we wish to optimize are now the Fourier coefficients An whereas we fix the frequencies \u03c9n = n\u03c0\u03c4 to be the first n Nc harmonics. This cutoff on the maximum frequency of the protocol reflects constraints in the experimental implementation. Although often randomized frequency components are chosen to improve convergence, we remark that we do not find this necessary for our purposes.\nTo then find the optimal protocols in this restricted family we use \u2202P to compute the derivatives \u2202I\u03c4\n\u2202An and employ them in\nstandard gradient-based optimization algorithms, such as the GD algorithm defined before. The Fourier coefficients are updated from their initial values using a gradient descent update scheme with an adaptive step size. This can be performed for a large number of coefficients since the gradient is calculated via differential programming. This involves the use of reverse mode automatic differentiation (backpropagation) where the gradient is calculated using the chain rule in a reverse order. Due to backpropagation, we can scale to thousands of Fourier coefficients without significantly increasing the computational cost.\nIn what follows we will examine the efficacy of these ansatzes where throughout: \u2202P free refers to the case where no constraints on the functional form of the control pulse are enforced, \u2202P STA corresponds to optimizing over\nthe shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocols constrained by Eqs. (11) and (12), and finally \u2202P Fourier denotes the use of Eq. (13)."

Fig. 2. The STA protocols are drastically different taking the form of a ramp up then down protocol for the velocity where they slowly accelerate to a finite velocity and then symmetrically decelerate again to zero. In contrast, the \u2202P free and Fourier protocols start and end with a small quench in position and in the middle oscillate with a constant average velocity. The size of the position quenches grows with decreasing transport time whereas the oscillations tend to become smoother with increasing time.\nIn order to analyze the frequencies \u03c9p, of these oscillations in Fig. 3(a) we show velocity protocols X\u03070(t ) for several trapping frequencies \u03c90. In the main panel we observe that the protocol frequency \u03c9p tends to increase with increasing \u03c90.\nFrom the inset we can then see that the relationship is linear with a coefficient very close to one, i.e., \u03c9p \u2248\u03c90. Whereas such an oscillatory behavior is common in Fourier-based optimal control approaches, and often these oscillations can be excluded or suppressed without affecting the effectiveness of the protocol [58], here we find that these oscillations are crucial to the performance of the protocol, in their absence the infidelities rise significantly.

This infidelity measure is the same as the standard target state infidelity I\u03c4 used before but computed with the fixed disorder pattern p added to the magnetic-field Bn(t ) + pn in the Hamiltonian. For the minimization we use Ip\u03c4 as the cost functional, and we compute its derivatives with respect to the control parameters with \u2202P. These derivatives are then used in combination with ADAM to update the controls An of the Fourier ansatz. We repeat the complete optimization process for several different disorder patterns p and finally average the result \u3008I\u03c4 \u3009s = 1pmax \u2211 p I p \u03c4 , where the subscript s indicates that the infidelity was optimized, individually, for each disorder pattern. In Fig. 6(a) we show the results for these optimizations as a function of the disorder strength . We also show benchmark results of the optimal protocols obtained with the \u2202P-STA and \u2202P-Fourier methods in the clean system. We observe that the disorder \u2202P optimization method (green line) is able to keep the infidelity \u3008I\u03c4 \u3009s close to zero (on the order of 10\u22123 and smaller). The infidelity \u3008I\u03c4 \u3009s of the benchmark protocols (blue and orange lines) for the same fixed disorder patterns is found to be increasing approximately quadratically with disorder strength. This shows that our \u2202P optimization method is still able to obtain high-fidelity control protocols in the presence of a specific disorder pattern.\nThis means that disorder in the setup itself is not immediately an issue as long as a suitable control protocol, designed for the specific disorder realization, is used. Note, however, that to find these protocols the learning algorithms have used information about the exact disorder patterns since the computed infidelity and the gradients implicitly depend on the disorder. As such, our \u2202P \u201cmodel-based\u201d approach only works when the exact form of the pattern is known or can be\n043138-6\nderived from experimental measurements. That said, the fact that suitable control protocols exist directly motivates the use of other gradient-free optimization approaches. We refer to the conclusion for a further discussion on this.\nTo try to understand how the optimization method is able to achieve these low infidelity values despite the presence of disorder, we show in Fig. 6(b) the optimal velocity protocols X\u03070(t ) for three specific disorder patterns. The obtained optimal protocols X\u03070(t ) are different for each different disorder pattern. This implies that during the optimization process the machine indeed learns about the specific disorder realization and finds a way to correct for it. This is likely due to the fact that the information of a fixed pattern p is directly encoded in the derivatives \u2202I p \u03c4\n\u2202An that the optimizer gets. The strategies being\ndifferent, however, also means that there is likely no universal strategy that obtains a low infidelity value for any disorder realization, which we elucidate in the following subsection."

            "text": "In the second scenario we consider \u2202P optimization when we do not know the exact disorder realizations and only have access to the magnitude of the noise. For this we take the disorder averaged infidelity \u3008I\u03c4 \u3009 as the figure of merit to minimize with \u2202P via batch gradient descent. We first fix a set of 200 different disorder realizations, divided up into 20 individual batches of 10 realizations. For each batch we compute the disorder-averaged gradients \u2202\u3008I\u03c4 \u3009\n\u2202An and use them to\nupdate the control protocol with ADAM. We do this cyclically which means we start from the first batch do an update and then move on to the second batch. When all batches have had one update we have completed one learning \u201cepisode\u201d and repeat the cycle. During this process \u3008I\u03c4 \u3009 averaged over all the 200 disorder patterns goes gradually down until convergence is reached.\nIn Fig. 7(a) we show the resulting averaged infidelity \u3008I\u03c4 \u3009 values for the optimal protocols obtained with batch gradient descent for 49.5 episodes. Note that we first optimized\nfor 24.5 episodes on one fixed set of 200 disorder realizations and then 25 episodes on a different set of 200 disorder realizations. Here 0.5 episode means that we stopped after 100 out of the 200 disorder realizations. For these \u3008I\u03c4 \u3009 values we have used a new set of disorder realizations which were not used during the optimization process. This gets rid of any optimization bias to particular disorder realizations, and we can fairly evaluate the performance. We see that now the optimization method is not able to keep the infidelity close to zero for increasing disorder strength . Instead it increases quadratically similarly to the benchmark protocols, with the batch optimization method providing a negligible increase in performance compared to the other protocols. We remark\n043138-7\nthis behavior is qualitatively consistent with previous studies focusing the effect of parameter fluctuations [56,64].\nAs a final remark we note that although the batch optimization method does not give a significant improvement in infidelity compared to the STA protocols, the form of the pulses are different between the approaches. We show in Fig. 7(b) the optimal velocity protocol obtained at a disorder strength of =0.16 compared to the optimal clean Fourier and STA protocols. We observe that the batch optimization protocol has much more rapid changes in the velocity and also obtains higher speeds, but, nevertheless, performs comparably to these protocols."

            "text": "We have examined schemes to achieve high-fidelity transport of magnons in clean and disordered Heisenberg spin chains. For this optimization task we have exploited a hybrid numerical-analytical approach employing different types of analytical ansatz for the protocols, optimized with differentiable programming (\u2202P). In the absence of disorder, effective control can be achieved with all techniques, however, certain limiting factors relating to the maximum speed emerge with the \u2202P Fourier able to approach the maximum group velocity. The relevance of external physical parameters, in particular, the frequency of the trapping potential used, was shown to manifest in the optimized protocols.\nIntroducing disorder, we showed that it is still possible to achieve near perfect optimal magnon transport for a fixed on-site disorder pattern, thus, demonstrating that the presence of disorder is, in and of itself, not a limiting factor in using quantum systems for communication. However, we also established that even with optimization one cannot achieve a \u201cone size fits all\u201d protocol if only the disorder strength and not the precise pattern is known. We focused explictly on the common assumption of Gaussian initial\nstates. Although this is useful for the approximate STA protocol, it is not critical for the implementation of the other protocols. We expect that other initial states will not qualitatively change our results. These results naturally lead to the question if the same protocols (or protocols with same performance) can be found with non-gradient-based optimization approaches, such as reinforcement learning [19,65\u201368] or natural evolution strategies [31,69]. This will be, particularly, intriguing for the fixed disorder pattern results as this potentially eliminates the need to know the exact disorder pattern.\nFrom an optimization perspective, several additional interesting avenues could be investigated. For example, how the control landscape properties (smoothness, convexity, etc.) [70] for the different protocol ansatzes change with the presence of disorder. It is also relevant to explore potential relationships between the complexity of the pulse, e.g., in terms of its spectral bandwidth, and the disorder. However, to explore these kind of questions about the effects of disorder often many computationally expensive numerical simulations must be performed. To resolve this and bring the computational complexity down, a final interesting question would be to see if one can train a neural network to predict the value of the cost function as was explored for a different problem in Ref. [71]."
