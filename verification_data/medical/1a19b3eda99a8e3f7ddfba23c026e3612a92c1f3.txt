"Given the difficulty and lack of standardized autonomic tests and well-established ranges of normal values for children, and non-availability of testing facilities nor experts [68], complete objective ANS testing could be used in future, to validate the autonomic symptom questionnaire as an alternative screener for detecting ANS function accurately in children with PWS. Emerging evidence points to specific genetic causes explaining autonomic dysregulation in certain conditions [18,69]. In future, detailed molecular genetic testing might be carried out in order to isolate and identify the genes in question and make early personalized preventative and treatment plans [18,69]."
