Hist\u00f3ricamente se ha invertido esfuerzo en el dise\u00f1o de nuevos instrumentos que superen las desventajas del est\u00e1ndar de referencia en cirug\u00eda, el bistur\u00ed. Como consecuencia de esto, han surgido equipos electr\u00f3nicos como el electrobistur\u00ed y los diferentes dispositivos de tecnolog\u00eda l\u00e1ser. La informaci\u00f3n disponible sobre estos instrumentos sugiere que la respuesta del tejido intervenido est\u00e1 influenciada por los principios f\u00edsicos y biol\u00f3gicos de corte del instrumento. Objetivo. Comparar los cambios histol\u00f3gicos en muestras de enc\u00eda asociados al corte quir\u00fargico realizado con l\u00e1ser de diodo de 940 nm, l\u00e1ser de erbio, cromo: itrio-escandiogalio-granate (Er,Cr:YSGG) (2780nm) y electrobistur\u00ed mediante una presentaci\u00f3n de serie de casos. Presentaci\u00f3n de los casos. Se presentan tres casos de pacientes sanos sometidos a cirug\u00eda est\u00e9tica. El examen cl\u00ednico revel\u00f3 la exposici\u00f3n de una banda gingival queratinizada mayor de 4 mm, tejido gingival de color y textura normales, de consistencia firme y sin sangrado al sondaje periodontal. Se indic\u00f3 gingivectom\u00eda con los siguientes protocolos: l\u00e1ser de diodo de 940 nm a 1 W, en modo continuo; l\u00e1ser de Er,Cr:YSGG de 2780 nm a 2,5 W, 75 Hz, modo H, aire 20, agua 40, punta de oro MT4; y bistur\u00ed el\u00e9ctrico en modo de corte, a nivel de potencia cuatro. Se tomaron muestras de tejido gingival y se almacenaron en formaldeh\u00eddo al 10 % para su an\u00e1lisis histol\u00f3gico. Conclusi\u00f3n. Los tres instrumentos de corte generaron cambios histol\u00f3gicos producidos por el efecto t\u00e9rmico; los principales fueron coagulaci\u00f3n del col\u00e1geno y carbonizaci\u00f3n. La profundizaci\u00f3n del da\u00f1o t\u00e9rmico causada por el l\u00e1ser de Er,Cr:YSGG de 2780 nm fue mucho menor que la generada por el electrobistur\u00ed y por el l\u00e1ser de diodo de 940 nm.\nPalabras clave.

It is common to find cases of gummy smiles, where the patient manifests dissatisfaction due to the reduced size of the teeth and the amount of gingiva shown when smiling (2). If the primary cause of the gummy smile is periodontal, the conventional treatment seeks to increase the clinical crown of the teeth through a gingivectomy (3). This procedure is traditionally performed with a scalpel or electric scalpel. However, with the advent of new technologies in dentistry, laser technology could represent a surgical alternative with multiple benefits, and its application, for years, has been reported by different authors (4-6).\nThe 940 nm diode laser and the 2780 nm erbio, cromo: itrio-escandiogalio-granate (Er,Cr:YSGG) laser have entered the dental field with a wide range of applications in different areas (7,8). Its main benefits in soft tissue surgeries are reduction or absence of intraoperative bleeding, speeded healing, reduction of postoperative pain and inflammation, absence of risk of damaging the adjacent tooth or bone, excellent hemostasis, reduction of postoperative bacterial contamination, and therefore, reduced risk of infection, light contact of the fiber tip with the tissue, proprioceptive feedback and good patient acceptance, especially in those procedures requiring only local anesthesia (9,10).\nA controlled clinical trial, carried out by Sobouti et al. in 30 patients who underwent gingivectomy to correct a gummy smile, showed that patients treated with the 940 nm diode laser had a significantly lower bleeding rate (0.36 out of 4) than that observed in the group operated with a conventional scalpel (1.15 out of 4). Likewise, it was observed that none of the diode laser participants showed post-surgical pain, nor did they consume analgesics, while in the control group, an average pain of 5.2 was obtained (out of a scale of 10), and 14 of the participants had to take pain medication (11).\nThis precedent shows the relevance of the instrument choice for soft tissue surgeries to provide comfort and results to the patient. Therefore, it is important to consider some aspects such as intraoperative and postoperative symptoms and time and mechanism of tissue healing, directly related to the effect exerted by the instrument to perform the cut.\nFrom this point of view, an incision in the gingiva comprises numerous events depending on the instrument used, from damage to the cells and the extracellular matrix to the complete carbonization of the tissue, implying a greater difficulty in the wound repair and healing processes (12). Few studies report the histological effect on gingival tissue exerted by cutting instruments.\nThis article aims to compare the histological changes in gingiva associated with surgical cuts made with a 940 nm diode laser, a 2780 nm Er,Cr:YSGGE laser, and an electric scalpel through a series of cases."

            "text": "Three clinical cases are presented: Two female patients and one male, who attended the dental clinic of the Corporaci\u00f3n Universitaria Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez in Cartagena due to aesthetic discomfort. All patients reported: \u201cI display a large amount of gum when smiling\u201d.\nDuring the anamnesis, patients did not report systemic pathologies or relevant personal or family medical history. When performing the stomatological examination, an exposure of keratinized gingiva greater than 4 mm was\nobserved in the three cases. The tissue was healthy, of normal color and texture, with a firm consistency and no bleeding on periodontal probing (figure 1).\nAs a treatment plan, gingivectomy and gingivoplasty were indicated in the upper jaw. Before the surgical procedure, oral health education was carried out to reinforce hygiene habits. The procedures were performed as follows:\nElectrosurgical gingivectomy: Two percent lidocaine plus 1:80,000 diluted epinephrine was used as local anesthesia. Probing was performed with a Michigan periodontal probe to determine the height and amount of gingival tissue to be cut. The cutting instrument used was an ART\u00ae Electrosurgery Unit in cut mode at an intensity level of four. The initial cut was made in the upper central incisors and used as guides to determine the gingival zenith. Then, we cut the lateral incisors, canines, and upper first premolars. At the end of the procedure, the patient was instructed to consume soft and cold foods for at least 24 hours. We prescribed drug therapy with 500 mg acetaminophen every six hours for three days. Clinical follow-up was carried out at 48 hours and 15 days after surgery (figure 2A).\n940 nm diode laser gingivectomy: The area to be intervened was anesthetized with lidocaine spray. For the procedure, we used a BIOLASE\u00ae Epic X equipment, following a protocol of 1 W of power in a continuous mode with an E3-4 surgical tip (30 \u03bcm x 4 mm length), previously activated in articulating paper. At the end of the procedure, the patient was instructed to consume soft and cold food for at least 24 hours.\n2780 nm Er,Cr:YSGG laser gingivectomy: Lidocaine spray was applied as topical anesthesia in the area to be operated. No infiltrative or regional anesthesia was used. We used a BIOLASE\u00ae Waterlase\u00ae equipment programmed at 2.5 W, 75Hz, H mode, air 20, water 40, and a gold sapphire tip MT4 (400 \u03bcm x 6 mm length). The procedure and tissue cutting were the same as those performed with the electric scalpel and diode laser (figure 2B and 2C).\nFigure 1. Initial photos.

The resection margin shows irregularity with a faint carbonization line (figure 3C).\n2780 nm Er, Cr: YSGG laser (H-E 10x): The section reveals a deep resection margin with intense collagen degeneration extending only to the irregular connective tissue, evidenced by a thin homogeneous basophilic band (red arrowhead). The estimated depth of thermal damage was 27,2 \u03bcm. Fibroblasts preserved their morphology until the basophilic area. In epithelial tissue signs of carbonization are observed with tissue sloughing (blue arrow) and peripheral irregularity (figure 3D). Irregular dense connective tissue has abnormally dilated blood vessels. Regular dense connective tissue maintains its vascular network, fibroblasts have a fusiform appearance, and no degenerative changes are observed."

            "text": "In dentistry, surgical cutting instruments have evolved. Currently, there are conventional scalpels, electric scalpels, and lasers, with varied applications in different dental specialties. All instruments incising the tissue generate lesions characteristic of its cutting mechanism and physical and biological properties (13). The cases presented in this paper confirm that the histological findings and the clinical characteristics of the wound vary according to the cutting equipment used. Although all instruments generate tissue lesions associated with thermal damage, when comparing them, we observed that some produce more damage than others.\nOf the exposed cases, the 2780 nm Er,Cr:YSGG laser was the instrument that generated the least thermal damage. Cercadillo et al. confirmed it: The samples with less thermal effect were irradiated with Er,Cr:YSGG laser at 2780 nm and water/air spray, followed by the CO2 laser and 830 nm diode laser, concluding that the emission parameters of each system can impact the thermal damage inflicted on soft tissues. However, the wavelength of each laser influences tissue absorption rate and its reaction (14). This instrument superficial thermal effect in comparison with the electric scalpel and diode laser, lies in the spray of water attached to the cutting piece. According to its mechanism, the water is energized with the laser light, favors the cut, and serves as a cooling medium, contributing to tissue protection (15).\nOn the other hand, one of the samples taken with an electric scalpel revealed areas with tissue damage due to carbonization, while the second sample exposed cell preservation, and the thermal effect did not carbonize the tissue. This behavior suggests other variables influencing the tissue during cutting, such as the operator\u2019s handling and the patient\u2019s periodontal phenotype. A thick periodontal phenotype may imply more than one cut in the gingival margin to remove it completely. Therefore, the tissue will suffer more damage.\nRegarding the effects of the electric scalpel, Ismail et al. indicated this incision produces thermal damage that includes carbonization, vacuolar degeneration, and nuclei elongation of the epithelial cells at the margins of the excision. Relevant findings with potential use in histopathological studies (16).\nThe 940 nm diode laser is a device with many indications in the dental field. Although it generated a thermal effect, we observed mucosa preservation and a poor carbonization area. Jin et al. compared wound healing after incisions with a conventional scalpel, a diode laser, and an Er,Cr:YSGG laser in the oral mucosa of guinea pigs and showed that the diode laser is a suitable device to use, but it produced more tissue damage than the scalpel or the Er,Cr:YSGG laser (17,18).\nThe clinical importance of these findings lies in the link between the histological condition and the postoperative period during the wound repair process (19). The epithelium healing route comprises a series of events in which the cellular and molecular dynamics of the injured tissue participate, seeking to restore integrity through epithelial migration that can be affected by different factors (20). During epithelium regeneration, the carbonization of the gingiva by the cutting instrument necessarily implies the necrosis of the burned area. The necrotic tissue acts as a barrier that interferes with the reparative action of the cells. Inflammation increases as leukocytes remove tissue debris through phagocytosis and lysis. In addition, necrotic tissue constitutes a niche for the proliferation of bacteria, increasing the risk of infection (21).\nSome reported biological effects of the laser could improve or counteract the thermal damage generated by the irradiation of the gingival tissue during the cut. The laser light absorbed by the cells enhances ATP production, which induces cell migration and proliferation. On the other hand, the photobiomodulation effect of the laser promotes angiogenesis and local lymphatic drainage, leading to a decrease in inflammation and edema (22). These effects could be related to pain reduction, inflammation, and postoperative edema in patients treated with diode laser. Likewise, it presents an advantage over other instruments, such as the electric and the conventional scalpel.\nKaur et al. compared the efficacy and healing of soft tissue wounds using a diode laser (810 nm) versus the conventional scalpel approach in the second stage of implant surgery. They reported that laser use can minimize surgical trauma, reduce the amount of required anesthesia, improve visibility during surgery due to the absence of bleeding, and eliminate postoperative discomfort (23)."

            "text": "Under the parameters used in this study, the three cutting instruments generated histological changes produced by the thermal effect. The main ones were collagen coagulation and carbonization. According to our measurements, the Er,Cr:YSGG laser was the instrument that generated the least thermal damage to the tissue. Therefore, more studies are needed to confirm these results and allow a broad comparison between the three instruments.\nDespite these findings, we found cell preservation indicators, implying other factors not related to the instrument that probably influence the generated effect on the tissue. These factors could be the periodontal characteristics of each patient and the operator\u2019s skill during the procedure."
