1. **Investigate the effects of different extraction parameters on the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of Hibiscus phenolic compounds.** This could be done by varying the extraction temperature, time, and solvent composition, and then measuring the resulting phenolic content and bioactivity of the extracts.


2. **Study the interactions between Hibiscus phenolic compounds and the gut microbiota.** This could be done by using in vitro and in vivo models to investigate how these compounds affect the composition and activity of the gut microbiota, and how these changes in the microbiota affect the bioactivity of the phenolic compounds.


3. **Explore the potential of Hibiscus phenolic compounds for use in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.** This could be done by conducting clinical trials to investigate the effects of these compounds on risk factors for chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.


4. **Develop novel food products and supplements that are enriched with Hibiscus phenolic compounds.** This could be done by using innovative processing and formulation techniques to create products that are both palatable and bioavailable.


5. **Investigate the potential of Hibiscus phenolic compounds for use in the cosmetics and personal care industry.** This could be done by studying the effects of these compounds on skin health and appearance, and by developing new products that incorporate these compounds.
