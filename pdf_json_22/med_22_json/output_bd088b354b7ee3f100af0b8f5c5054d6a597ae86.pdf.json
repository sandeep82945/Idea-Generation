It is the only species in the family Cephalotaceae and is restricted to a small region of Western Australia. Here, we\u00a0used metabarcoding to characterize the bacterial and eukaryotic communities living in C. follicularis pitchers at two different sites. Bacterial and eukaryotic communities were correlated in both richness and composition; however, the factors associated with richness were not the same across bacteria and eukaryotes, with bacterial richness differing with fluid color, and eukaryotic richness differing with the concentration of DNA extracted from the fluid, a measure roughly related to biomass. For turnover in composition, the variation in both bacterial and eukaryotic communities primarily differed with fluid acidity, fluid color, and sampling site. We\u00a0compared C. follicularis-associated community diversity with that of Australian Nepenthes mirabilis, as well as a global comparison of Southeast Asian Nepenthes and North American Sarracenia. Our results showed similarity in richness with communities from other pitcher plants, and specific bacterial taxa shared among all three independent lineages of pitcher plants. Overall, we\u00a0saw convergence in richness and particular clades colonizing pitcher plants around the world, suggesting that these highly specialized habitats select for certain numbers and types of inhabitants.\nKeywords: carnivorous plant, bacteria, eukaryote, convergent evolution, microbe, microbiome\nINTRODUCTION\nCarnivorous pitcher plants are a clear example of convergent evolution, where the same form and function has evolved independently across three different lineages (Albert et\u00a0 al., 1992). These \u201ctrue\u201d pitcher plants have pitcher-shaped, single leaves containing small ecosystems with complex communities of arthropods and microbes (Adlassnig et\u00a0 al., 2011). In recent years,\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887635\nthere has been a growing recognition of the importance of plant-associated communities beyond just the organisms that are clearly symbionts or pathogens (Bell et\u00a0 al., 2019; Leveau, 2019). Pitcher plants provide an opportunity to examine how hosts with similar morphology and life-history traits that have evolved independently in dramatically different geographic locations, can nevertheless attract and cultivate similar communities within their structures. Pitcher plant-associated communities from the genera Sarracenia (family Sarraceniaceae) and Nepenthes (family Nepenthaceae) have now been characterized across numerous studies (Peterson et\u00a0 al., 2008; Koopman and Carstens, 2011; Gray, 2012; Gray et\u00a0 al., 2012; Kanokratana et\u00a0 al., 2016; Bittleston et\u00a0 al., 2018; Grothjan and Young, 2019; Gilbert et\u00a0 al., 2020a,b). Many of the same bacterial and eukaryotic taxonomic groups are common in both Sarracenia and Nepenthes communities and their metagenomes show enrichment in specific degradation genes (Bittleston et\u00a0 al., 2018), suggesting that convergent interactions (Bittleston et\u00a0 al., 2016b) may exist among these convergently evolved plants and the organisms living in their pitchers. However, there is very little known about the communities associated with natural populations of the third pitcher plant lineage in the genus Cephalotus, and its bacterial microbiome has never been characterized.\nThe Albany pitcher plant, C. follicularis (Figure\u00a0 1A), is the only genus and species in the family Cephalotaceae (Conran, 2004). It is endemic to the coastal region of South-Western Australia near the town of Albany, and few studies have examined the plant and its associated organisms in its natural habitat (Parkes and Hallam, 1984; Clarke, 1988; Yeates, 1992; Pavlovic, 2011; Lymbery et\u00a0 al., 2016; Just et\u00a0 al., 2019). Despite their small native range, the unusual C. follicularis plants are prized by collectors and have been cultivated and sold around the world (Conran, 2004). The plants grow in wet, peat-soil swamps often in seepage areas (Conran, 2004) and have been shown to get about 26% of their nitrogen from captured prey (Schulze et\u00a0 al., 1997). Recently, the genome of C. follicularis was sequenced, and transcriptomic analysis of carnivorous vs. non-carnivorous leaves identified genetic changes associated with carnivory (Fukushima et\u00a0 al., 2017). This diminutive and charismatic plant is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, due to population reduction from habitat loss and overcollection, highlighting the necessity for a better understanding of its ecology.\nCarnivorous pitcher plants trap and digest insects as a strategy for gaining nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients that are lacking in the generally water-logged soils where they grow. Despite their consumption of insect prey, a living community of arthropods, protozoa, algae, fungi, and bacteria thrive in the aquatic pitcher pools (Kitching, 2000). Pitcher microbiomes likely assist in degradation of prey and support plant nutrient access (Butler et\u00a0 al., 2008; Luciano and Newell, 2017; Bittleston et\u00a0 al., 2018). In Nepenthes and Sarracenia species, pitcher-associated communities have been found to vary by host species and pitcher fluid pH and volume, among other characteristics (Kanokratana et\u00a0 al., 2016; Bittleston et\u00a0 al., 2018; Gilbert et\u00a0al., 2020b). Pitcher plants, despite being unusual within the plant world, are an emerging model system for\ncommunity ecology because their pitchers contain small, naturally replicated microcosms that assemble anew each time a pitcher opens (Srivastava et\u00a0 al., 2004; Peterson et\u00a0 al., 2008; Miller et\u00a0 al., 2018; Ellison and Gotelli, 2021).\nThe extreme geographic isolation of C. follicularis from other pitcher plants may lead to it hosting fewer metazoan inhabitants (inquilines). A study of aquatic organisms, ranging from bacteria to fish, found higher dispersal limitation in larger organisms (De Bie et\u00a0 al., 2012). Beaver (1985) and later Clarke (1988) hypothesized that metazoan food web complexity in Nepenthes pitcher plants had geographical underpinnings, related to factors such as landmass size, degree of spatial and temporal isolation, the size of the local species pool capable of colonizing pitchers and the number of Nepenthes species present. One of the few known pitcher inhabitants of C. follicularis, and the only insect, is the larvae of the fly Badisis ambulans. This inquiline has never been found outside of C. follicularis pitchers and its interaction with the plant may be\u00a0 mutualistic or parasitic (Yeates, 1992; Lymbery et\u00a0al., 2016). The thesis of Sally A. Clarke examined C. follicularis-associated protists in depth, but did not list many metazoans.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first metabarcoding study characterizing the entire bacterial and eukaryotic communities of C. follicularis pitcher pools and comparing them with those of other pitcher plant species. Here, we\u00a0 aim to: (1) characterize the bacteria and eukaryotes associated with C. follicularis pitchers using DNA metabarcoding, and to assess how they are affected by site and host characteristics and (2) investigate possible convergence in community richness and shared taxa due to the very distinctive and similar life form among pitcher plants. We\u00a0 ask: What organisms live in C. follicularis pitchers? How do growing site and characteristics of the pitcher fluid impact community composition and structure? Do different factors affect bacterial and eukaryotic communities? Are C. follicularis pitcher communities similar to those found in Australian Nepenthes? Do we\u00a0 see convergent interactions such as those found in Sarracenia and Nepenthes?"

We\u00a0 haphazardly selected 20 healthy pitchers on different plants at each site that had no visible damage. Although it is difficult to gauge pitcher time-since-opening in the field without marking unopened pitchers and returning over time, we\u00a0 aimed to select pitchers of different ages to get a full representation of the existing diversity. The entire pitcher fluid from each pitcher was collected using a sterile pipette for each sample and was transferred to sterile tubes.

DNA amplification and Illumina MiSeq nextgeneration sequencing were performed at Argonne National Laboratory\u2019s Environmental Sample Preparation and Sequencing Facility (ESPSF). We\u00a0 used the Earth Microbiome Project\u2019s original barcoded 16S (515F-806R, V4 region) and 18S (1391f1510r, V9 region) primers that were adapted for the Illumina MiSeq (Amaral-Zettler et\u00a0al., 2009; Stoeck et\u00a0al., 2010; Caporaso et\u00a0 al., 2012).

We\u00a0 used QIIME2 versions 2018.4 and 2019.10 (Bolyen et\u00a0 al. 2019) on the Boise State computing cluster for quality control, Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) generation, taxonomic assignment, and phylogenetic trees. We\u00a0 denoised sequences and generated ASVs with the DADA2 (Callahan et\u00a0 al., 2016) plugin, and 16S taxonomy assignment with the classify-sklearn Naive Bayes classifier (Pedregosa et\u00a0 al., 2011), and a pre-trained classifier made with the Greengenes database, version 13_8 (McDonald et\u00a0 al., 2012; Bokulich et\u00a0 al., 2018). For 18S taxonomy assignment, we\u00a0used the classify-consensusvsearch method and the SILVA 128 database. For both loci, we\u00a0 used the QIIME2 SEPP plugin (Janssen et\u00a0 al., 2018) to build phylogenies. All downstream analyses were done in R (version 4.0.2, R Core Team, 2020).\nWe removed all sequences assigned as chloroplasts from the 16S data, and bacteria and archaea from the 18S data. To minimize misassigned sequences and to focus on organisms most likely to be\u00a0 associated with pitchers, we\u00a0 removed all observations with fewer than 10 sequences and samples with fewer than 1,000 sequences. We\u00a0 focused on C. follicularis communities first, creating a subset of just these samples and rarefying at 4,039 sequences for 16S and 2,704 for 18S. We\u00a0ran generalized linear models (GLMs) using a Gamma distribution (log link function) to examine the association of bacterial and eukaryotic richness (measured as Effective Number of Species, a Hill number that is the exponential of the Shannon index; Jost, 2007; Chao et\u00a0 al., 2014) with site, DNA concentration, and pitcher fluid pH, volume, and color. We\u00a0 chose to use GLMs in order to measure all of our variables together to control for their effects on each other and to avoid transforming non-normally distributed data. We\u00a0 made sure that our data met the assumptions for a Gamma GLM (see R code in the Dataverse repository). For beta diversity analyses, we\u00a0 used unweighted UniFrac, a phylogenetic distance metric, and NMDS plots to visualize in ordination space. We\u00a0 ran PERMANOVAs with the function adonis from the vegan package (Oksanen et\u00a0 al., 2020) to measure the effects of categorical variables and their interactions, and mantel tests for continuous variables. The R package, metacoder (Foster et\u00a0 al., 2017) was used to parse and plot significant ASVs by fluid color based on taxonomy and relative abundance. Some of the Australian N. mirabilis samples had lower sequence numbers, so in our comparison of the N. mirabilis with C. follicularis samples, we\u00a0 rarefied at 1,306 for bacteria and 1,556 for eukaryotes.\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887635\nFor our phylogenetic tree figures, we\u00a0 focused on ASVs that were represented by at least 100 sequences, and that were present in at least 10% of each category for our Cephalotus, Nepenthes, or Sarracenia samples.

These were compared with ASVs from surrounding habitats, including bog water, soil, water held in fallen leaves, and water collected in sterile glass tubes. We\u00a0 used the online interactive tree of life, iToL, software to plot and annotate the trees. The annotations around the outside of the circular trees show the log of the cumulative relative abundance of each ASV, normalized by the number of samples in that category.\nOur R code and all the necessary input files and metadata have been deposited in the Harvard Dataverse and are accessible at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WG1TI6."

Pitcher fluid pH and the total extracted DNA concentration from each sample also did not differ by site (Mann\u2013Whitney U tests, p > 0.05), and fluid pH also (marginally) did not significantly differ by fluid color (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.06763). Fluid pH and DNA concentration were not correlated with volume (linear models, p > 0.05); however, fluid pH and DNA concentration were correlated with each other (linear model, t value = 2.88, p = 0.0065), with more acidic pitchers having lower DNA concentrations (Supplementary Figure\u00a0 1B). A similar effect of pH on DNA extraction success has been noted in a previous study in Nepenthes pitcher plant microbial communities (Gilbert et\u00a0 al., 2020b). A PCA biplot of pitcher pH, volume, and DNA concentration showed separation of the different factors among our samples (Supplementary Figure\u00a01C).\nTop Organisms in Cephalotus follicularis-Associated Communities We measured community composition of C. follicularis-associated bacteria and eukaryotes by analyzing data from 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

Interestingly, the second most abundant ASV at each of our sites was in the genus Rhodanobacter but was represented by a different ASV at each site. In general, the C. follicularis microbiome was dominated by bacteria from the Gammaproteobacteria (Figure\u00a0 1B).\nIn the 18S C. follicularis sequence data, post-quality control we\u00a0 had 668,485 sequences across 40 samples with a mean of 16,712 sequences per sample and 526 distinct ASVs. Rarefaction curves showed that most samples reached a plateau in diversity before our rarefaction cutoff (Supplementary Figure\u00a0 2B). The most abundant groups were Metazoa and Fungi, which represented 41.2% and 40.4% of the top\u00a020 ASV reads, respectively (Figure\u00a0 1B). The taxonomy, relative abundances, and NCBI BLAST results for the top\u00a0 20 ASVs are reported in Supplementary Dataset 1, accounting for 59.0% of the sequences.\nWithin Metazoa some of the most commonly identified taxa included: Chromadorea (roundworms), Diptera (flies), Araneae (spiders), and Adinetida (rotifers).

This measure of richness also incorporates the evenness of the community. For bacteria, the effective number of species per sample ranged from 2.5 to 56.7, with a median of 11.1 and a mean of 13.7 (Figure\u00a0 1C). Eukaryotic communities generally had lower richness with a range of 1.7 to 17, a median of 6 and a mean of 7.1 (Figure\u00a01C). Our results indicate that bacterial and eukaryotic richness are correlated with each other (Table\u00a01;\nFigure\u00a0 1D); however, surprisingly, the significant effect is only seen in the bacterial GLM but not the eukaryotic one. This result suggests that the diversity of bacterial taxa increases in response to increased diversity of eukaryotes, although it could also be\u00a0a response to unmeasured environmental or host factors.\nVariation in richness in each of the two broad taxonomic groups is associated with different factors. When controlling for other variables, bacterial but not eukaryotic richness significantly varies with color of the pitcher fluid (specifically clear vs. brown and green) but not site, volume or DNA concentration, while the 18S GLM indicates that eukaryotic richness significantly varies only with DNA concentration (Table\u00a0 1). Effect plots for the bacterial and eukaryotic GLMs are shown in Supplementary Figures\u00a0 3, 4, respectively.\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 5 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887635\nTurnover in Community Composition Varies Significantly by Pitcher Fluid Characteristics, by Site, and Between Bacterial and Eukaryotic Communities Despite our two sites being less than 20 km apart, both pitcher bacterial and eukaryotic communities show significant differences in compositional turnover (beta diversity) by site, which explains ~4\u20135% of the existing variation (PERMANOVA, Bacteria R2 = 0.04215, p = 0.010; Eukaryotes R2 = 0.04755, p = 0.001; Table\u00a02). Our NMDS plots indicate separation by site diagonally along both axes 1 and 2 for bacterial and eukaryotic communities (Figures\u00a0 2A,B). For both bacterial and eukaryotic community compositions, a large portion of the variation is explained by fluid pH (mantel tests: Bacteria r = 0.2837, p = 0.001; Eukaryotes r = 0.3903, p = 0.001; Table\u00a0 2; Figures\u00a0 2C,D). In the NMDS plots, bacterial communities have more distinct clustering by site, and a more linear gradient of community composition dissimilarity by fluid acidity, than eukaryotic communities. Although exact reasons for the color change of pitcher fluids are not fully known, fluid color is also correlated with specific pitcher communities, and explains more of the variation in community composition than site does for both bacteria and eukaryotes (Bacteria R2 = 0.16485, p = 0.001; Eukaryotes R2 = 0.12727, p = 0.001). In eukaryotes, there is a significant interaction between site and fluid color (R2 = 0.09836, p = 0.007), while in bacteria, the interaction shows a trend that is not significant (R2 = 0.08946, p = 0.076).

Although the calendar dates for comparison sampling both fell within 2016, they were separated by 5 months (January for C. follicularis, roughly midsummer at a temperate, less humid latitude, and May for N. mirabilis, the start of winter months at a humid, tropical latitude on the opposite side of the country, more than 3,400 km away).\nThe 21 samples collected from N. mirabilis at one site near Bramston Beach hosted communities similar to those of C. follicularis with regard to bacterial taxa, with Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria at similar relative abundances and the highest representation. However, there were relatively more taxa in the class Bacteroidia in N. mirabilis, and fewer in the classes Actinobacteria and Acidobacteriia (Supplementary Figure\u00a05). The two Australian pitcher plant species were more different with regard to their associated eukaryotic taxa; in particular N. mirabilis had relatively more Metazoa (mostly represented by insects) and fewer Fungi (Supplementary Figure\u00a0 5).

            "text": "The pitchers of C. follicularis represent a unique habitat that is vulnerable to extinction along with its charismatic host plant (Conran, 2004). Here, for the first time, we\u00a0 used metabarcoding to characterize the full eukaryotic and bacterial communities living within C. follicularis pitchers and compared them with pitcher communities from across the globe. We\u00a0 found differences in the factors affecting richness of C. follicularis bacterial and eukaryotic communities (Table\u00a01), while factors affecting community composition were generally more similar (Table\u00a0 2; Figure\u00a0 2). We\u00a0 also saw convergence in the richness and composition of bacterial taxa of C. follicularis when comparing with the convergently evolved Nepenthes and Sarracenia species from other parts of the world (Figure\u00a0 3). Eukaryotic taxa showed less striking convergence, with strong similarities in richness but primarily only dipteran insects as shared inquilines. In our samples, C. follicularis pitchers tended to have fewer arthropod inquilines than have been reported from Nepenthes and Sarracenia pitchers. The consistently small C. follicularis pitcher size may be\u00a0 partly responsible for the differences in eukaryotic taxa, but it also seems possible that their highly isolated and remote location in Western Australia\u2014 almost an island within an island\u2014may have limited the kinds and numbers of invertebrate colonists the pitchers have received (Beaver, 1985; Clarke, 1998).\nPrevious studies have noted differences in factors affecting the diversity of bacterial and eukaryotic communities, as well as correlations between these different taxa (Ragon et\u00a0al., 2012; Ramirez et\u00a0 al., 2014; Li et\u00a0 al., 2017). For example, a study of Nepenthes-associated communities along an elevational gradient in the Philippines found clear differences in the environmental and host factors affecting bacterial and eukaryotic communities, with elevation having a stronger effect on eukaryotes while pH had a stronger effect on bacteria (Gilbert et\u00a0 al., 2020a). Another study across the communities of eight Nepenthes species found a strong correlation between bacterial and eukaryotic community composition, and noted tight clustering of protist and bacterial taxa in a co-occurrence network (Bittleston, 2018). Correlations in the diversity of eukaryotic and bacterial communities could be\u00a0driven by species interactions; for example, a more diverse suite of eukaryotic algae may lead to a more diverse suite of bacteria able to metabolize a variety of algal compounds.\nWhen exploring the richness of C. follicularis pitcher-associated communities, we\u00a0 found that bacterial and eukaryotic richness were correlated, but potentially driven by different factors. Bacterial richness differed by the color of the pitcher fluid, while eukaryotic richness differed by DNA concentration. It is unclear why eukaryotic richness would decrease with increasing DNA concentration, since DNA concentration can be\u00a0 a proxy for biomass within the sample. However, it could indicate a bloom of a particular organism: if one species multiplied quickly, it would increase biomass of the focal species while decreasing the overall effective number of species. We\u00a0 also noted a weak correlation between DNA concentration and fluid pH, which either could suggest that lower pH environments house fewer organisms and thus have lower overall biomass, or could suggest that DNA is more difficult to extract from lower pH fluids. In soils, lower pH is associated with decreased microbial growth rates but not biomass (Malik et\u00a0 al., 2018) and can cause adsorption of extracellular DNA to adsorption onto the soil matrix (Young et\u00a0 al., 2014). It is unclear if these processes would apply to pitcher fluid.\nIn contrast to our richness results, the turnover in community composition of bacterial and eukaryotic communities was generally affected by the same factors, with few exceptions. Both pH and fluid color explained relatively large portions of the variation in bacterial and eukaryotic communities, and the site was also significant although with smaller effect sizes, while neither taxonomic group was significantly explained by pitcher fluid volume. As with richness, only eukaryotic community composition had a significant relationship with DNA concentration. The largest effect size from our mantel tests was for the correlation between bacterial and eukaryotic phylogenetic dissimilarities themselves, suggesting that bacterial and eukaryotic compositions change across samples in similar ways, either due to species interactions or to similar responses to habitat differences.\nOur analysis using taxonomic heat trees revealed enrichment of certain taxa in different colors of pitcher fluid and one between sites. The taxa in differently colored fluids likely either caused the color changes or were affected by a shift in chemistry\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 9 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 887635\nor nutrients related to a color change. Green, brown, and yellow fluids were enriched with algae in the Chlorophyta group, while cloudy fluids were enriched with bacteria in the order Bacillales. The algae likely contributed to the green, brown, and yellow coloration, while the bacteria may have contributed to the cloudiness. Only one taxon differed significantly by site, the fungal genus Mortierella. Species of Mortierella are generally decomposers, and some have the ability to degrade the chitin in insect exoskeletons (Okafor, 1966; Edgington et\u00a0 al., 2014) or to enhance plant growth when part of the rhizosphere (Li et\u00a0 al., 2020). Potentially the Mortierella that were enriched at the TPB site were involved in breaking down insect prey captured by C. follicularis pitchers, and a possible symbiosis between the fungus and pitcher plant would be\u00a0 interesting to explore further.\nPitcher communities change over successional time, from pitcher opening to senescence. This successional change has been well-documented only in Sarracenia purpurea (e.g., Gray, 2012; Miller and terHorst, 2012; Luciano and Newell, 2017; Boynton et\u00a0 al., 2019), but occurs in N. mirabilis (Benson, Bittleston, and Pierce, unpublished results), and likely also in C. follicularis. Limitations of our current study prevented us from sampling the same pitchers at different successional stages; however, we\u00a0 aimed to select healthy pitchers of different ages to get a full representation of the existing diversity. Future studies in C. follicularis could sample across different seasons and successional stages.\nAll three genera of pitcher plants host specialized insects (Adlassnig et\u00a0 al., 2011), and host specificity of inquilines could lead to co-evolution of the plant and certain associated organisms over time. For example, in the Sarracenia alata system, pitcher communities\u2014and arthropods in particular\u2014 have co-diversified with their host plants across a biogeographic barrier (Koopman and Carstens, 2011; Satler and Carstens, 2016, 2019). The main eukaryotic taxonomic group showing convergence in our study is Diptera, or flies. These highly-represented ASVs likely come from DNA of specialized inquilines and not from prey, since previous pitcher plant studies have demonstrated corroboration between amplicon sequencing-derived taxa and barcoded DNA extracted directly from inquilines (Bittleston et\u00a0 al., 2016a). The most abundant dipteran ASVs from C. follicularis map most closely to Drosophila; however, it is likely that they are actually the inquiline fly Badisis ambulans, whose larvae we\u00a0 saw swimming in our pitcher samples. Badisis ambulans is not represented in the NCBI database, in fact, currently only one taxon in the whole Micropezidae family is represented by a section of the 18S rRNA gene sequence. The dipteran ASVs from Nepenthes and Sarracenia are generally assigned to the mosquitoes, midges, and other flies that are known inquilines of these plants (Bittleston et\u00a0 al., 2016a, 2018). Overall, we\u00a0 saw lower eukaryotic species richness in the Australian N. mirabilis pitchers when compared with other Nepenthes, potentially because Australian N. mirabilis is geographically isolated on the edge of the Nepenthes distribution without other co-occurring Nepenthes species (Beaver, 1985; Clarke, 1998). Similarly, C. follicularis had\nfewer insect ASVs than N. mirabilis and the other pitcher plant species, perhaps due to a combination of geographic isolation and small size. The other eukaryotic group showing convergence across pitcher plant genera was Formicidae, or ants, and these ASVs likely come from the primary prey of pitcher plants, as all three groups commonly capture and digest ants (Ellison and Gotelli, 2009).\nBeyond arthropods, many bacterial groups were present across the three genera of pitcher plants. It is possible that taxa in these shared groups (such as the Acetobacteraceae, Rhodanobacteraceae, Chitinophagaceae, Burkholderiaceae, among others) could be\u00a0 specialists in the pitcher habitats; however, host specificity in bacteria is rare and difficult to test. It is more likely that they are present due to environmental filtering as a result of host convergence with regard to the pitcher habitat. Pitchers are not just passive receptacles, they affect the habitat inside via excretion of digestive enzymes, oxygenation, and sometimes active pH adjustment (Bradshaw and Creelman, 1984; An et\u00a0 al., 2001; Adlassnig et\u00a0 al., 2011; Sirota et\u00a0 al., 2013; Ravee et\u00a0 al., 2018; Gilbert et\u00a0 al., 2020b). A recent experiment found S. purpurea regulates the structure of its inquiline food web, and direct contact with the plant tissue was important (Ellison et\u00a0 al., 2021). Similarities in the chemistry and conditions of other, non-host associated habitats can also lead to convergence in bacterial communities; for example, similarities in pH, salinity and other soil characteristics drive similarity in soil microbial communities (Ramirez et\u00a0 al., 2014; Rath et\u00a0 al., 2019). However, non-host associated systems are less likely to represent convergent interactions (Bittleston et\u00a0 al., 2016b), where a specific functional interaction\u2014such as bacteria assisting pitcher plants in the degradation of insect prey\u2014emerges independently in multiple instances. Due to the combination of convergent evolution at the host level and likely chemical similarities at the pitcher habitat level, we\u00a0consider this convergence as both evolutionary and ecological.\nThe similarities in richness and bacterial taxa in C. follicularis, Nepenthes and Sarracenia pitcher communities in very different parts of the world\u2014Australia, Southeast Asia and North America\u2014suggests that pitchers in general cultivate a particular habitat that selects for a similar microbiome, regardless of location or evolutionary history (Bittleston et\u00a0 al., 2018). This is not to say that communities hosted by different genera of pitcher plants do not show variation. In fact, each particular plant can host unique combinations of taxa that, at the fine scale, vary between genus, species, site, and even within a population due to unique characteristics like pitcher fluid acidity. However, at a broad scale, pitcher microbial communities on opposite sides of the world are more similar to each other than to the water-filled leaf, bog water, or soil communities in the surrounding habitats."
