    "abstractText": "Molybdenum ions are covalently bound to molybdenum pterin (MPT) to produce molybdenum cofactor (Moco), a compound essential for the catalytic activity of molybdenum enzymes, which is involved in a variety of biological functions. MoaE is the large subunit of MPT synthase and plays a key role in Moco synthesis. Here, we investigated the function of MoaE in Deinococcus radiodurans (DrMoaE) in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that the protein contributed to the extreme resistance of D. radiodurans. The crystal structure of DrMoaE was determined by 1.9 \u00c5 resolution. DrMoaE was shown to be a dimer and the dimerization disappeared after Arg110 had been mutated. The deletion of drmoaE resulted in sensitivity to DNA damage stress and a slower growth rate in D. radiodurans. The increase in drmoaE transcript levels the and accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species levels under oxidative stress suggested that it was involved in the antioxidant process in D. radiodurans. In addition, treatment with the base analog 6-hydroxyaminopurine decreased survival and increased intracellular mutation rates in drmoaE deletion mutant strains. Our results reveal that MoaE plays a role in response to external stress mainly through oxidative stress resistance mechanisms in D. radiodurans.",

            "text": "The trace element molybdenum is a key component of several enzymes involved in nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon metabolism [1]. Molybdenum usually binds to molybdenum pterin (MPT) to form molybdenum cofactor (Moco) as the catalytic site of molybdoenzymes, such as DMSO reductase family, xanthine oxidase family, and sulfite oxidase family [2]. In all prokaryotes, the biosynthesis of Moco can be divided into four steps: (1) conversion of 5\u2032-GTP into cyclic pyropterin monophosphate (cPMP) [3]; (2) insertion of two sulfur atoms into cPMP to form MPT [4]; (3) intercalation of molybdenum into the disulfide sulfur of MPT, which catalyzes the formation of Mo-MPT [5]; and (4) covalent binding of CMP or GMP to MPT. Finally, Moco is processed by the molybdenum enzyme and catalyzes the redox reaction in which the molybdenum enzyme participates [6]. The conversion of cPMP into MPT in the Moco biosynthetic pathway is responsible for MPT synthase [4]. MPT synthase is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two small and two large subunits encoded by moaD and moaE [7]. Structural analysis of MPT synthases from Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus have shown that the central dimer is formed by two MoaE subunits, each containing MoaD [4,8], and the small subunit of MPT synthase is thiolated at the C -terminus of MoaD in the form of the carboxylic acid group carrying a sulfur atom [3]. The two MoaE\u2013MoaD dimers function independently during the reaction, with each MoaE subunit bound to one cPMP molecule [9]. In E. coli and most organisms, MPT synthase is encoded by the moaD and moaE genes. In addition to two moaD genes (moaD1 and moaD2) and two moaE genes (moaE1 and moaE2), Mycobacterium tuberculosis also contains an moaX gene encoding linearly fused MoaD and\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2441. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24032441 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2441 2 of 14\nMoaE proteins. It has been confirmed that cleavage is required to activate the function of MoaX, the cleavage position is between Gly82 and Ser83 residues, and the Gly81-Gly82 motif is necessary for catalysis [10]. MoaE is essential for Moco synthesis. In M. tuberculosis, Moco biosynthesis is also associated with its pathogenicity [11], and the deletion of moaE results in the disruption of the Moco biosynthetic pathway [10]. In Pseudomonas putida, moaE is essential for the generation of the molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide (Mo-MCD) required for molybdenum enzymes, and its deletion inhibits the growth of the strain in cultures with nicotine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source [12]. Deinococcus radiodurans R1 was first isolated from \u03b3-irradiated meat cans in 1956 [13]. In addition to \u03b3 irradiation, this robust organism also has high levels of resistance to UV radiation, desiccation, oxidizing agents, and other DNA-damaging agents [14]. D. radiodurans possesses strong abilities in preventing the formation of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) [15,16], activating antioxidant defense systems [17,18], as well as removing and degrading damaged bases [19,20]. In D. radiodurans, the DrMoaD\u2013MoaE fusion protein is encoded by the dr_2607 gene, and the JAMM protein encoded by dr_0402 activates DrMoaD and DrMoaE [21,22]. However, the contribution of the Moco biosynthetic pathway to the extreme resistance of D. radiodurans remains unknown. In the present study, the crystal structure of DrMaoE, an important protein in Moco biosynthesis, was determined, and Arg110 was found to be the key residue for its dimerization. The deletion of drmoaE led to an increased susceptibility to stress-induced oxidative damage, a loss of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase activity, and an elevated rate of mutations caused by base analogs. The data above indicate that DrMoaE plays an important role in response to oxidative stress in D. radiodurans."

DrMoaE structural data with a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5 were obtained (Supplementary Table S1), revealing that each monomeric protein consisted of three \u03b1 helices and six \u03b2 sheets.

In the present study, we solved the crystal structure of DrMoaE by 1.9 \u00c5 resolution. Compared with previously reported structures of homologous proteins from E. coli and M. tuberculosis, DrMoaE had a high similarity but exhibited a significant angular deflection of the loop sequence between its \u03b22 and \u03b23 sheets. The positively charged residues His109, Arg110, and Arg45, which can form an nion-binding pocket in D. radiodurans, were the most conserved in different organisms. However, a significant angular shift in the positively charged residues of the substrate-binding pocket of EcMoaE compared to DrMoaE was found in the structural comparison, suggesting that there may be variability in the substrate-binding mode in different species. Meanwhile, the structural analysis revealed that Arg110 is essential for the dimerization of DrMoaE, and the stable\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2441 8 of 14\ndimerization state of DrMoaE disappeared after mutation of this site, indicating that Arg110 is important in the dimerization of DrMoaE. The \u2206drmoaE mutant strain was sensitive to various DNA-damaging agents, especially to oxidative stress caused by H2O2. The deletion of drmoaE resulted in growth restriction of D. radiodurans. Intracellular ROS accumulation confirmed that drmoaE deficiency led to ROS accumulation under oxidative stress in D. radiodurans, while the transcript levels of drmoaE in the wild-type strain were elevated under oxidative stress. The above results suggest that drmoaE plays an important role in oxidative stress resistance in D. radiodurans. CAT and SOD are important ROS scavengers in D. radiodurans, and the absence of drmoaE has little effect on their activities, suggesting that an additional effective ROS scavenging mechanism is required for DrMoaE to perform its function. It was shown that the ratio of MoO42\u2212 affected the capacity of redox metabolic in Agave [27]. The transport pathway of MoO42\u2212 is mainly converted into Moco through the Moco biosynthesis pathway to complete the function of a series of molybdenum enzymes such as DMSO reductase. The loss of DMSO reductase activity in the \u2206drmoaE mutant suggests that the function of molybdenum enzymes is hindered by the absence of drmoaE, thereby affecting the antioxidant process in which molybdenum enzymes are involved in D. radiodurans. Modified nucleobases that can participate in cellular processes together with natural substrates which are toxic and/or mutagenic are traditionally referred to as base analogs [26]. In organisms, base analogs can act as products of oxidative stress damage, such as 5-hydroxy-dCTP [28], 2-hydroxy-dATP [29], and 8-oxo-dGTP [30]. Base analogs are potent mutagens, such as HAP for adenine analogs, which are inserted into the DNA strand by DNA polymerase, leading to incorrect DNA replication and mutations, and are therefore commonly used to test the metabolism of nucleotide precursors or the mechanisms of DNA replication and repair [31]. Our study showed that DNA and DNA bases were exposed to peroxyl radicals (ROO\u2212), a major intracellular oxidant and oxidative stress product, with HAP being the major product [32]. The \u2206drmoaE mutant strain exhibited a significant decrease in survival rate and a significant increase in mutation rate in vivo after treatment with HAP, suggesting that the deletion of drmoaE leads to the accumulation of base analogs in vivo and an increase in DNA mutations. In E. coli, the DMSO reductase-dependent deletion of the bisC Moco pathway is insensitive to HAP [33]. In vitro studies have found that mammalian xanthine oxidase is able to reduce HAP to adenine [34]. The treatment of wild-type strains with febuxostat, a specific inhibitor of xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase, was to found to have no effect on the mutation rate in D. radiodurans, nor did hypoxanthine-specific inhibition of xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase in E. coli. However, cell lysates from E. coli moaE deletion mutant strains resulted in a decrease in the conversion of HAP to adenine with reduced efficiency [35], suggesting that moaE mediates a specific molybdenum enzyme pathway involved in the metabolism of base analogs in bacteria, other than the common molybdenum enzyme pathway reported to date. In conclusion, our results support that DrMoaE possesses a conserved MoaE protein structure, with a more disordered loop between the \u03b22 and \u03b23 sheets, while the cPMPbinding pocket Arg110 residue is a key site for its dimerization, which responds to the oxidative damage process in D. radiodurans, and is thus able to reduce base damage and genomic DNA mutations to defend against various external stresses."

Superoxide anion (O2\u2212) that was produced by the reaction of xanthine and xanthine oxidase in the kit reduced nitro-blue tetrazolium to blue formazan. After the addition of SOD, O2\u2212 was cleared so as to inhibit the formation of formazan. It was considered an enzyme activity unit (U) when the percentage of SOD enzyme inhibition of the xanthine oxidase coupling reaction system described above was 50% at 37 \u25e6C."
