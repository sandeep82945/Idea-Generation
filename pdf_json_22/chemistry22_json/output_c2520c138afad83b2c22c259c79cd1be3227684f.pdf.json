Appropriately, corrosion surfactants (regularly surfactants) should be injected with the hydrochloric acid solution to avoid the adverse impact of acid on the surface of the pipelines.1 CS has been extensively applied as a production material for pipe paintings inside the oil and fuel lines, which include down hollow tubular, oat lines, and transmission pipelines.2 Surfactants are compounds that may be determined in a huge variety of business settings to analyze laboratories and are part of our everyday lives.

Nowadays, surfactants are widely used, and nd a wide range of applications in the petroleum industry. This is attributed to their remarkable ability to inuence the properties of surfaces and interfaces. Recently, one of the most important applications of surfactants is effective corrosion inhibition in the oil industry. It interacts with anodic or cathodic reaction sites and retards corrosive oxidation and reduction reactions. An increment in surfactant action was observed when the concentration within the destructive arrangement approaches the basic critical micelle concentration (CMC). Above this value, there was no further increment in the efficiency that remains constant for further increment in surfactant concentration. Within the nonappearance of a charged head group, the driving force of micellization is the hydrophobic drive and van der Waals attractions. The strong interaction between water particles repulses the hydrocarbon chain from the water bulk phase. This drives the surfactants to form aggregates where the hydrophilic head groups conceal the hydrocarbon chains. It was observed that the adsorption of these surfactants depends on the\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3253\u20133273 | 3253"

The adsorption happens due to the interaction of the lone pair and/orp-orbitals of surfactants with the d-orbitals of the metal surface atoms, which brings out more prominent adsorption of the surfactant particles onto the surface, leading to the formation of a corrosion protection lm.5\u20137 The adsorption is additionally affected by the structure and the charge of themetal surface, and the type of testing electrolyte.8\u201310Recently, quantum chemical strategies have been demonstrated to be exceptionally valuable in deciding the atomic structure as well as elucidating the electronic structure and reactivity.11 In this way, it has gotten to be a common practice to carry out quantum chemical calculations in corrosion hindrance studies. The concept of evaluating the productivity of a corrosion surfactant by computational chemistry is to search for compounds with desirable properties using chemical intuition and experience into a mathematically quantied and computerized form. Once a relationship between the structure and movement or property is found, any number of compounds, counting those not however synthesized, can be promptly screened by a computational technique12 and a set of numerical conditions, which can speak to the chemical phenomenon beneath study.13,14 Surfactants, because of their remarkable ability to inuence the properties of surfaces and interfaces, have been effectively exploited as corrosion surfactants in an acidic medium.15\u201325 Surfactants are amphiphilic molecules containing one hydrophilic (head) and other hydrophobic (tail) parts; this favors the adsorption process at metallic surfaces\u201d. The hydrophilic part of the surfactant can be positive, negative, impartial or zwitterionic and the hydrophobic component includes one or more hydrocarbon chains, commonly with 6\u201322 carbon atoms.\nThe aim of this paper is to get data on the level of corrosion activity in a system, utilizing the chemical and electrochemical procedures. This information is utilized to assess the corrosion surfactant capability. Another objective of this work is to calculate the more related molecular properties based on its activity as corrosion inhibitors. The nearby reactivity was analyzed using Fukui indices, since they indicate the reactive regions within the shape of the nucleophilic and electrophilic behavior of each atom in the molecule. These surfactants are not used as corrosion inhibitors for CS in HCl media in the literature."

The selected surfactants act as mixed-type inhibitors i.e., promoting retardation of both anodic dissolution of CS and cathodic hydrogen discharge reactions. This was conrmed by the slow displacement of Ecorr. (less than 85 mV). By inspecting the data in Table 3, it can be observed that: (a) with the increase in surfactant concentration, icorr. values decrease gradually, (b) the anodic and cathodic Tafel slopes (bc & ba)) are slightly changed aer surfactant addition, and (c) this indicates that surfactants inuence both anodic and cathodic processes;44 the IE increases reaching a maximum value of 86.46% at 8 10 4 M.

These diagrams exhibit one capacitive loop appearing as a semicircle in Nyquist plots, being more pronounced with the increase in surfactant concentration. Bode plots given in Fig. 7 show that a single maximum of the phase angle corresponds to each capacitive loop in Nyquist plots. From Bode graphs plotted as phase vs. log F, it may observed that the phase angle does not exceed 90 (like for pure capacitive impedance).45 Consequently, log Z vs. log frequency Bode plots (Fig. 5) show two horizontal plateaus at the highest frequencies, which is attributed to log Rs\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The high Rct values are generally associated with a slower corroding system.54 The decrease in Cdl suggests that the surfactant molecule function by adsorption at the metal/ solution interface and can result in a decrease in the local dielectric constant and/or an increase in the thickness of the electrical double layer.55 It was also observed from the Table that the (n) value varies directly with the surfactant concentration, while the reverse is the case with Yo, the (n) value being a measure of the roughness of the surface of the working electrode resulting from the adsorption of the surfactant molecules\u201d.56\n3.2.3 EFM measurements. EFM is an electrochemical technique in which two sinusoidal potential signals are summed and applied to a corrosion sample via a Potentiostat. \u201cThe great strength of the EFM is the causality factor which serves as an internal check on the validity of the EFM measurement.57 With the causality factors, the experimental EFM data can be veried. EFM is a nondestructive corrosion measurement like EIS; it is a small signal ac technique. Unlike EIS, however, two sine waves (at different frequencies) are applied to the cell simultaneously. The results of EFM experiments are a spectrum of current response as a function of frequency. The spectrum is called the intermodulation spectrum. The spectra contain current responses assigned for harmonica and intermodulation current peaks. The larger peaks were used to calculate the corrosion current density (icorr.), the Tafel slopes (bc and ba) and the causality factors (CF-2 and CF-3). Intermodulation spectra obtained from EFM measurements are presented in Fig. 9 for 0.5 M HCl in the absence and presence of 8 10 4 M of AOT, TX-100 and DTAC, respectively. Similar curves were obtained for other concentrations of surfactants (not shown). As can be seen\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nfrom Table 5, the corrosion current densities decrease by increasing the concentrations of the studied surfactants. The % IEEFM calculated from eqn (8) increase by increasing the studied surfactant concentrations. The causality factors in Table 5 are very close to theoretical values, which according to the EFM theory58 should guarantee the validity of Tafel slopes and corrosion current densities. Fig. 9 shows the % IE recorded for DTAC, TX-100 and AOT at a concentration of 8 10 4 M using the four different techniques, namely, WL, PP, EIS and EFM\u201d. The calculated % IE found is in excellent agreement.\nThe order of the % IE found for the Rct data is DTAC > TX-100 > AOT (Fig. 10). \u201cThe% IE, calculated from EIS results, show the same trend as those obtained from PP measurements. The difference in % IE from two methods may be attributed to the different surface status of the electrode in two measurements. EIS was performed at the rest potential, while in polarization measurements, the electrode potential was polarized to high overpotential and non-uniform current distributions, resulting from cell geometry, solution conductivity, counter and reference electrode placement, etc., which will lead to the difference between the electrode area undergoing polarization and the total area\u201d.59"

These aggregates have been called \u201chemi-micelles\u201d63 or, in general, \u201ccolloids\u201d for surface colloids.64 The driving force for adsorption \u00f0DG C C\u00de results from the free energy of transferring the hydrocarbon chains from the aqueous environment into the hydrophobic interior of the aggregates.

For instance, adsorption of a nonionic surfactant such as ethoxylated alcohol and sugar-based alkyl glucoside on oxides has been proposed to involve hydrogen bonding.66,67 It should be noted that for adsorption due to hydrogen bonding to take place, the bond formed between the surfactant functional groups and mineral surfaces should be stronger than that formed between the mineral and interfacial water molecules\u201d.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

            "text": "The adsorption of ionic surfactants on oppositely charged surface could be taking the following path: (i) \u201cAt low surfactant concentrations, the adsorption is due to electrostatic interaction between individual isolated charged monomeric species and the oppositely charged solid surface. (ii) Surfactant species begin to form surface aggregates, colloids (surface colloids), including hemi-micelles and ad-micelles, due to lateral interactions between hydrocarbon chains. Thus, the additional driving force resulting from the lateral association with the electrostatic interaction is still active. (iii) When the solid surface is electrically neutralized by the adsorbed surfactant ions, the electrostatic attraction is no longer operative, and adsorption takes place due to lateral attraction alone with a reduced slope. (iv) When the surfactant concentration reaches critical micelle concentration, the surfactant monomer activity becomes constant and any further increase in the concentration contributes only to themicellization in solutions and it does not change the adsorption density. The adsorption in this region is mainly through lateral hydrophobic interaction between the hydrocarbon chains. In steps (iii) and (iv), surfactant molecules adsorb with a reversed orientation (head groups facing the bulk solution), resulting in a decrease in the hydrophobicity of the particles in this region. The pH plays a very signicant role in controlling the adsorption of ionic surfactants. Thus, the adsorption of anionic surfactants is higher on positively charged surfaces (pH below isoelectric point (IEP)) than on negatively charged surfaces, while the cationic surfactants adsorb more on negatively charged surfaces.69,70 The molecular structure of surfactants does inuence its adsorption behavior markedly. Most nonionic surfactants contain polar groups that form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the solid surface. Since the hydrogen bonding is weaker than the electrostatic interaction, the adsorption of the nonionic surfactant to most solids is less than that of ionic surfactants. Nonionic surfactants exhibit adsorption like those of cationic surfactants, except for a sharp increase in step III of the adsorption mechanism because of the absence of electrostatic interactions. The adsorption of the nonionic surfactants also depends on the pH and number of the hydrophilic groups and the hydrocarbon chain length\u201d. Several adsorption isotherms have been assessed, and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm become determined to be the excellent description of the adsorption conduct of the applied surfactants, which obey the subsequent eqn (13):\nCinh/q \u00bc1/Kads + Cinh (13) Kads \u00bc 1=Csolvent exp DG\nads\nRT\n(14)\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3253\u20133273 | 3265\nFig. 11 Langmuir bends for the adsorption of DTAC, AOT and TX-100 on CS in half molar HCl at different temperatures."

The higher the values of electron affinity EA ( ELUMO), the stronger the electron accepting abilities of the molecules.

The feasible adsorption of organic cations in the presence of the halide ions is due to the formation of intermediate bridge, the negative ends of the halide metal dipoles being oriented towards the solution. The dipoles of the surface compound formed are oriented with their negative ends towards the solution, whereby setting up an additional potential difference between the metal and the solution. This will shi the zero-charge potential positively. This shi will make the charge on the metal surface more negative and facilitates the adsorption of positively charged quaternary ammonium compound [C12H25N\n+(CH3)3] by the formation of ionic bonds. Cl ions act as adsorption mediators for bonding the two positive partners, the metal surface and the positively charged ammonium compound. This gives rise to the formation of an adsorption composite lm, in which the chloride ions (Cl ) are sandwiched between the metal and positively charged part of the surfactant.76 This lm acts as a barrier facing the corrosion process, as shown in Fig. 13. Anionic part of AOT is a soer base than Cl thus it attached with metals (soer) via covalent adsorption. The anionic part of AOT suggested a competitive effect with Cl ions of the HCl solution. In this case (showing the anodic process of iron corrosion), Cl ion-catalyzed iron dissolution occurs\u201d. The anionic part of AOT can retard the corrosion process by adsorption onto a positively charged steel surface.\nThe anodic process of iron corrosion eqn (20)\u2013(22):\nFe + Cl % FeClads (20)\nFeClads / Fe Cl+ + 2e (21)\nFe Cl+ % Fe2+ + Cl (22)\nFrom Fig. 13, we can observe that: The HOMO location in the cationic part of DTAC surfactants is mostly distributed on the hydrophobic part. \u201cThe LUMO location in the cationic part of DTAC is mostly distributed on the nitrogen cation that the preferred sites for the nucleophilic attack through metallic negative centers. The position of the surfactant (lying vertically) could be the reason for the high surfactant efficiency. The HOMO location in the nonionic surfactant is mostly distributed on the benzene ring (hydrophobic part) and oxygen atom attached to it. The LUMO location in the nonionic surfactant is mostly distributed on the benzene ring (hydrophobic part). However, the molecular structure of TX-100 suggests that they are able to adsorb onto the metal surface through two lone pair of electrons of the polar hydrophilic head groups by forming hydrogen bonds. Oxygen atoms can form a protective layer (which blocs the active sites of corrosion on the metal surface). The position of the surfactant (lying at) could be the reason for the high surfactant efficiency. The HOMO location in anionic surfactants is mostly distributed on oxygen atoms attached to the sulfur atom, indicating that the preferred sites for the electrophilic attack through metallic positive center are located on these oxygen atoms. The LUMO location in the anionic surfactant is mostly distributed on oxygen atoms of the nearest\n3270 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3253\u20133273\nacetate group to the sulfur atom, indicating that the preferred sites for the nucleophilic attack through metallic negative centers are located on the oxygen atoms. From the above, it is mentioned that a hydrophilic metal surface attracts a large hydrophilic head group of chosen surfactants. Table 7 shows that the values of DE dropped in the following order: AOT+ > TX-100 > DTAC, showing that DTAC inhibits more effectively than TX-100 and AOT. From this table, because DTAC has a greater s and lower h value, it can be inferred that this molecule has a higher potential to be adsorbed on steel surfaces. It should also be noticed that DTAC has the maximum number of electrons, indicating that this chemical has a strong theoretical capacity to suppress steel corrosion. These ndings indicate that the active centers on the steel surface are extremely well adsorbent of this chemical. Among the theoretical models proposed to compute local reactivity indices are Fukui functions that make it possible to rationalize the reactivity of individual molecular orbital contributions, thus to account for the response of the whole molecular spectrum and not only of the frontier orbitals. Frontier orbital electron densities on atoms provide a useful means for the detailed characterization of donor\u2013acceptor interactions. In the case of a donor molecule, f (r) electrophilic electron density corresponds to reactivity with respect to electrophilic attack or when the molecule loss electrons and in the case of an acceptor molecule, f+(r) nucleophilic electron density corresponds to the reactivity with respect to nucleophilic attack. However, frontier electron densities can strictly be used only to describe the reactivity of different atoms in the same molecule. The highest FI values are presented in Table 8. The most susceptible sites for electrophilic attack are located on C10, C11, C12 and C13 atoms in case of DTAC, oxygen atoms"

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nAccording to the equilibrium congurations of the three inhibitors adsorbed onto the Fe (110) surface, we can draw a conclusion that surfactants can be absorbed onto the Fe surface through their oxygen atoms. In this way, the covering with surfactants, consequently preventing the surface from contact with water, can reduce the exposure of the Fe surface. Therefore, the corrosion inhibition is achieved by this factor. It can be inferred that the inhibitor molecules will form a waterproof lm on the Fe surface aer addition to the solution.

Adsorption energy: the energy, in kcal mol 1, released (or required) when the relaxed adsorbate components are adsorbed onto the Fe surface. This is the sum of the rigid adsorption energy and the deformation energy for the adsorbate components. Rigid adsorption energy: the energy, in kcal mol 1, released (or required) when the unrelaxed adsorbate components (before the geometry optimization step) are adsorbed onto the Fe surface. Deformation energy: the energy, in kcal mol 1, released when the adsorbed components are relaxed on the Fe surface. dEad/dNi: the energy, in kcal mol 1, of Fe surface-adsorbate congurations where one of the adsorbate components has been removed. Table 9 shows that the DTAC compound has the maximum binding energy, followed by TX-100, while AOT was the least effective compound in the simulation experiment. The inhibitory trend is still changing, with the adsorption energy increasing in the order of DTAC > TX-100 > AOT. Hence, the better stability formed complicated happened with DTAC and accordingly will increase its inhibition efficiency and that is steady with experimental results. In addition, the simulation was conducted in the presence of water species, with the same compound inhibition order. This demonstrates that DTAC inhibits most of the other chemicals in all of the systems studied. The results given in Table 9 reect that the average value of adsorption energies is higher of order DTACwater > AOT-water > TX-100-water system. In addition, the average energy needs to release DTAC are higher than those of other surfactants."

            "text": "DTAC, AOT and TX-100 showed good performance as corrosion inhibitors in hydrochloric acid media. The inhibition is because of the adsorption of the surfactant molecules onto the CS surface and blocking off of its active sites. Adsorption of the surfactants suits the Langmuir isotherm model. The results obtained from WL, PDP, EIS, and EFM tests are in reasonably excellent agreement and display improved surfactant performance with the growing surfactant concentration. PDP records display that the applied surfactants act as mixed-kind inhibitors in half molar HCl. The theoretical examination of molecules in each gaseous section and liquid section indicated the difference among AOT, TX-100, and DTAC, consistent with the HSAB principle. SEM combined with EDX and AFM analyses of the morphology of the CS surface revealed the presence of a persistent and insoluble adherent layer that prevents the electrolyte from reaching the metal's surface. Monte Carlo simulations reveal a strong interaction between the surfactants studied and the CS surface.\n3272 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3253\u20133273"
