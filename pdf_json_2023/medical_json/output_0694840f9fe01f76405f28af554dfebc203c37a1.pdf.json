In Arabidopsis the triple H1 mutant (3h1) was generated by crossing h1.1h1.2 with h1.3 (17, 20).\u2019 \u2018Detailed microscopic imaging revealed that the euchromatin in 3h1 nuclei shows reduced homogeneity with spatially distributed chromatin nanodomains as compared to a highly regular distribution in wild-type chromatin (17). The heterochromatic organization was also disrupted in the 3h1 mutant (17).\u2019 \u2018Previous work, using MNase seq and FRAP of 3h1 suggested that loss of H1 causes partial loss of structural differentiation of the chromatin states (17). Also, a recent study demonstrates that the double h1.1h1.2 mutant has minor but significant increase in accessibility of H3K27me3 marked gene body regions (27).\u2019 \u2018The role of the stress inducible H1.3 variant in regulating abiotic stress has been previously described (21). H1.3 expression was strongly induced by a combination of drought and low light stresses, while with h1.3 mutant plants failing to mount a typical adaptive response to drought stress (21). In addition, H1 variants collectively fine-tune developmental aspects like dormancy, lateral root formation, stomata and root hair density and flowering in Arabidopsis (17).\u2019\nC\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

            "text": "In Discussion, the following sentences have been added: \u2018Our transcriptome analysis showed that 3h1 has differentially regulated transcriptome under normal conditions even in absence of any stress. This corroborates a previous study where almost 700 genes were found to be differentially regulated in 3h1 (17). The higher number of DEGs in our work is possibly due to using a different age of plants grown in pots and different growth conditions.\u2019 \u2018An earlier study, using RNAi mediated silencing of H1, resulted in minor but significant changes in methylation of repetitive and single-copy DNA sequences in a stochastic manner (25). The higher methylation of TEs in all contexts in 3h1 mutant plants is in agreement with the methylation patterns observed for long TEs in the double mutant h1.1h1.2 (Figure 5) (23). A similar methylation profile as that of double h1.1h1.2 mutant was also observed around TEs under normal conditions for 3h1 (21).\u2019 This sentence has been changed:\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/9/4691/7137444 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\n\u2018The higher methylation of TEs in all contexts in 3h1 mutant plants is in agree-ment with the methylation patterns observed for long TEs in the double mutant h1.1h1.2 (Figure 5) (23).\u2019 to \u2018Likewise, the higher methylation of TEs in all contexts in 3h1 mutant plants is in agreement with the methylation patterns observed for long TEs in the double mutant h1.1h1.2 (Figure 5) (21).\u2019 This sentence has been changed: \u2018However, the minor changes observed in global H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in 3h1 compared to WT indicate that H1 is not involved in these marks at the genome-wide scale, although local changes might be present, or changes were not observed due to the cell type-specific and developmental stage-specific nature of these modifications (54) (Supplementary Figure S9).\u2019 to \u2018However, we observed minor changes in global H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels in 3h1 before and after flg22 treatment. In contrast, significant changes in H3K27me3 levels were observed in h1.1h1.2 double mutant especially in specially localized regions like telomeres (27). Lower levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were observed in H1 related mutants in previous studies taking into account the whole seedling or specialized tissues (17, 42, 57). These studies indicate that different tissues and developmental stages can exhibit variable dynamics of these histone marks. The different experimental setups can also reflect in the observed differences. As leaves of adult plants were used in this work, it will be interesting to further investigate the dynamics of these histone changes at different developmental stages (17, 58).\u2019 This sentence has been changed \u2018The lack of developmental or pathogen phenotypes in single mutants of Arabidopsis H1.1 and H1.2 reflects the redundancy of the linker histones\u2019 to \u2018The lack of developmental or pathogen phenotypes in single mutants of Arabidopsis H1.1 and H1.2 reflects the redundancy of the linker histones as already suggested in previous studies (17)\u2019"
