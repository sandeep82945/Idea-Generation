            "text": "Inflammation is a normal immune defense mechanism of the body, but it is a double-edged sword. The shortterm clearance of inflammatory by the defense system can promote the recovery of the body. However, the longterm inflammatory defense could lead to tissue organs damage, causing anaphylactic reactions, or even disease (1). When immune response is stimulated by pathogens, the macrophages secret proinflammatory cytokine (2). Excessive production of inflammatory cytokines could lead to fever, asthma, arthritis, and even cancer (3). Free radicals widely exist in the human body and are important factors in regulating cellular signaling pathways and maintaining body balance (4). Oxidative stress is caused by excessive free radicals, leading to cardiovascular disease (5), inflammatory (6), immunomodulatory (7), hypertension, and even tumor (8).\nEdible fungi are mushrooms with edible fruit body and have a long research history in China (9). Pholiota nameko, one kind of edible fungi, belongs to genius Lepidoptera (Cortinariaceae). It originated in Japan and has distributed in many provinces of China (10). This kind of mushroom can be easily cultivated and is regarded as a healthy food with higher carbohydrate and lower fat. Polysaccharides extracted from edible fungi are normally biological compounds which have functions of anticancer (11), anti-inflammatory (12), antioxidant (13), hypoglycemic (14), intestinal regulation (15), and immunization (16, 17). The chemical composition, structural characteristics,\nand biological activity of polysaccharides are affected by different extraction methods (18). High-temperature pressure method is a green extraction method with few solvents and low energy consumption. It uses high temperature and high pressure to increase the solubility of target compounds and solvent diffusion rate. Studies have shown that the extraction rate of polysaccharide by high-temperature pressure method was higher than that by microwave, ultrasonic, and hot water extraction methods (19, 20). Lee et al. (21) have shown that polysaccharide with higher molecular weight have better anti-cancer effects. Therefore, the high temperature and pressure method is an effective green extraction method to improve the extraction rate and biological activity of polysaccharide. Moreover, in order to enhance biological function of natural polysaccharides, some methods are used to modify their structure (22). There exist several ways for structure modification, such as chemical methods, physical methods, and biological methods. Among these methods, chemical methods are the most widely adoption (23). Chemical modification can improve or change biological functions of polysaccharides mainly through changing molecular weight and type, position and number of substituents in structure of polysaccharides (24). The principal methods of chemical modification are complexation with metal ions, sulfation, sulfonylation, acetylation, alkylation, selenization, carboxymethylation, phosphorylation, and benzoylation. Phosphorylation of polysaccharides is modified by introducing phosphate ester bonds into structure of polysaccharide (25).\nFrontiers in Nutrition 02 frontiersin.org\nSince phosphate has three negative charges, it can affect certain activities of polysaccharides, like antioxidant activity, anticancer activity by enhancing their electronegativity (26, 27). However, few researches have investigated structures and functions of polysaccharides from fruit body of P. nameko and phosphorylated modification of these polysaccharides.\nIn this study, a novel polysaccharide was extracted from dried body of P. nameko and purified by a DEAE-52 column and a Sephadx G-100 gel column. Its structure features, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory effects were determined by chemical methods and RAW267.4 cells. Also, structural and functional comparison between this novel polysaccharide and its phosphorylated polysaccharide were investigated. This study could provide theoretical bases in further researches about a potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity from phosphorylated mushroom polysaccharide."

An autoclave (U1000, Xinyi CO., Shanghai, China) was used for extraction of crude polysaccharide (CPN) from the mixture at 110\u25e6C, 1.2 MPa for 30 min. After centrifugation, concentration, and deproteinization (Savge method), solution of CPN was obtained. Adding four times ethanol into the solution to stand for 10 h at 4\u25e6C then centrifugating at 4,500 rpm for 10 min and lyophilizating for 24 h, crude polysaccharide was obtained.\nIsolation and purification of novel polysaccharide\nThe method was determined by Zhou et al. (29) with slight modification. A DEAE-52 column (2.6\u00d7 40 cm) and a Sephadx\nG-100 gel column (1.6 \u00d7 40 cm) were used for separation and purification (30). Briefly, 1 g CPN was dissolved in deionized water (1:20, w/v), centrifuged at 4,500 rpm for 10 min. Then, the supernatant was loaded in a DEAE-52 column, flowed with different concentrations of NaCl solution at 1.0 mL/min. The effluents were collected and measured by phenol sulfuric acid method. The main fractions are showed in Figure 1A. For purification, each fraction was subsequently injected in a Sephadx G-100 gel column, eluted by deionized water at 0.5 mL/min. The fraction of the most symmetrical eluting peak was collected (Figure 1B). After concentration, dialyzation, and lyophillation, the purified polysaccharide (SPN) was obtained for further study.\nPhosphorylation and degree of substitution of phosphorylated polysaccharide\nPhosphorylation of SPN was based on method of Xiong et al. (31). Three gram sodium triphosphate and 1 g sodium trimetaphosphate were dissolved in 100-mL distilled water. Then, 500 mg SPN and 2.5 g sodium sulfate was added into this solution. After adjusting pH to 8.5 by NaOH (5 mol/L), the solution was placed at a water bath (80\u25e6C) and then dialyzed for 48 h in a dialysis bag (MwCO 8,000\u201314,000 Da). Adding four times ethanol into this solution for 12 h at 4\u25e6C then centrifugating at 4,500 rpm for 10 min and lyophilizating for 24 h, phosphorylated polysaccharide (PPN) was obtained. The degree of substitution is calculated by following formula (32):\nDS = 5.23P\n100\u2212 3.32P (1)\nP, percentage of phosphorus element; DS, degree of phosphate substitution."

Compared to SPN, after substitution of phosphate group, O-H absorption peak of PPN was weaker which indicated that intermolecular hydrogen bonding action\nFrontiers in Nutrition 06 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 2 FT-IR spectra of SPN and PPN.\nof PPN was weaker than that of SPN. The absorption peak between 1,400 and 1,200 cm\u22121 was variable angle vibration of C-H. However, in PPN spectrum, this absorption peak shifted from 1,361 to 1,305 cm\u22121 because of phosphorylation. The absorption peaks of SNP at 895, 1,025 cm\u22121, and PPN at 895 cm, 1,023 cm\u22121 indicate that they are pyranose containing \u03b2 configuration. The absorption peaks of SPN at 1,639, 1,423 cm\u22121 and PPN at 1,647, 1,417 cm\u22121 indicated that they were acidic polysaccharides, which was consistent with the determination of uronic acid (45). Also, the new absorption peak of 1,241 cm\u22121 was the asymmetrically stretching vibration of P = O (46) and the new peaks around 727 cm\u22121 attributed to C-O-P symmetrically stretching vibration compared to spectrum of SPN (47), but all peaks were not obvious because the lower degree substitution of phosphate group. FI-IR spectra showed phosphorylation of SPN changed its structure and probably would have effect on its biological function.\nAccording to the standard dextran of different molecular weight (logMw = -0.3991RT + 17.78, R2 = 0.9968), the average molecular weight of SPN was 15.8 kDa with the retention time of 34.03 min and the average molecular weight of PPN was 27.7 kDa with the retention time of 33.42 min. In addition, both elution peaks were single and symmetric in the GPC spectra, indicating they were both homogeneous fractions (48).\nHPLC analysis shown in Table 2 determines the monosaccharide composition of SPN and PPN. They both\nmainly contained rhamnose, glucose, arabinose, galacose, and mannose. However, the contents of each monosaccharide in the two polysaccharides were different as previous research reported (49). SPN contained 7.4% rhamnose, 6.4% mannose, 38.6% glucose, 20.5% arabinose, and 27.1% galacose, while PPN contained 8.5% rhamnose, 7.3% mannose, 44.9% glucose, 15.7% arabinose, and 23.6% galacose by area ratio. The results showed that phosphorylation increased the ratio of glucose and arabinose, while decreased the ratio of galactose."

The relative proportions of terminal residues and branching residues were almost equal, indicating that the polysaccharides were completely methylated (50). In addition, the proportion of glycosyls in methylation analysis was consistent with that in monosaccharide composition. However, the disappeare of 1,2,5-linked Araf, 1,5-linked Araf and the generation of 1,2,4-linked Glcp, 1,3-linked Galp in PPN indicated that they were located in the branched chain. The man chains of the SPN and PPN were composed of 1,4-linked Glcp, 1,6-linked Galp, 1,2-linked Rhap, 1.6-linked Manp and the terminals of t-linked Glcp, t-linked Araf. This result suggested that phosphorylation did not change the main chain structure of the polysaccharide. The side chain of SPN is 1,4,6-linked Galp, 1,2,5-linked Araf, while PPN is 1,4,6-linked Galp, 1,2,4-linked Glcp. It is shown that the phosphorylation changes the branching structure of the polysaccharide. This might be due to the different effects of phosphorylation on the hydrolysis of different glycosidic bonds. For example, the branched chains are easier hydrolyzed than the backbone, and furanose is more hydrolyzed than pyranose (51).\nTABLE 3 Methylation analysis data.\nMethylated sugars\nLinkage patterns\nSPN relative amount (%, area) PPN relative amount (%, area)\n2,3,4,6-Me4-Glcp 1-linked Glcp 8.4 12.7 2,3,6-Me3-Glcp 1,4-linked Glcp 34.5 21.2 3,6-Me2-Glcp 1,2,4-linked Glcp \u2013 13.5 2,3,4-Me3-Galp 1,6-linked Galp 16.7 13.5 2,3-Me2-Galp 1,4,6-linked Galp 7.9 9.5 2,4,6-Me3-Galp 1,3-linked Galp \u2013 4.1 2,3,5-Me3-Araf 1-linked Araf 6.6 11.4 3-Me-Araf 1,2,5-linked Araf 5.5 \u2013 2,3-Me2-Araf 1,5-linked Araf 10.9 \u2013 3,5-Me2-Rhap 1,2-linked Rhap 5.0 6.2 2,3,4-Me3-Manp 1.6-linked Manp 4.5 7.9"

Previous research proved that NO concentration is an important index to evaluate macrophage activation (58). In Figure 6B, the NO concentration in blank control group was 3.1 \u00b5mol/L, while RAW 264.7 cells released great amount of NO after 1 \u00b5g/mL LPS treatment for 24 h (8.6 \u00b5mol/L). Compared with blank control group, the NO concentration of LPS treatment group extremely increased (p < 0.01). However, with different concentrations of polysaccharides and LPS treatments for 24 h, the NO levels significantly reduced (p < 0.01), and the reducing effects were more significant in higher concentration polysaccharides treatments, compared with LPS treatment group. Besides, the reducing effect of NO concentration by PPN was better than that by SPN in same concentration. This is consistent with previously published results by Yang et al. (59).\nTNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels analysis TNF-\u03b1, mainly produced by monocytes, macrophages, has functions of inflammatory regulation, participation in fever and inflammation occurrence (60). In Figure 6C, after 24 h treatment with 1 \u00b5g/mL LPS, TNF-\u03b1 level significantly raised from 184.9 to 521.8 pg/mL (p < 0.01), compared with blank control group. Similar with NO concentration results, TNF-\u03b1 level significantly decreased with polysaccharides concentration increasing (p < 0.01), and the effect of SPN was always weaker than that of PPN in same concentration. This result was also identified by Tian et al. (61).\nIL-1\u03b2, mainly released by activated macrophages, can play a role in inflammatory regulation (62). In Figure 6D, the IL1\u03b2 level of LPS model group extremely increased from 5.2 to 32.2 pg/mL compared to blank control group (p < 0.01). Also, the IL-1\u03b2 level of polysaccharides treatment groups gradually decreased as concentration of polysaccharides increased. Moreover, the decreasing effect on IL-1\u03b2 concentration of PPN was always better than that of SPN.\nIL-6 is one of the most common pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted mainly by activated macrophages, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells, and has multiple inflammatory functions, which can participate in vivo inflammatory response as an important inflammatory medium (63). From Figure 6E,\nFrontiers in Nutrition 11 frontiersin.org\n1 \u00b5g/mL LPS treatment for 24 h can significantly enhance the IL-6 level from 36.7 to 131.8 pg/mL compared with blank control group (p < 0.01). With the increase of polysaccharides concentration, IL-6 level decreased gradually. In addition, the ability of inhabiting IL-6 release of PPN was always better than that of SPN in every concentration.\nmRNA expression levels analysis Quantitative RT-PCR was used to investigate the effect of PPN on the mRNA expression of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR. From Figure 7, 1 \u00b5g/mL LPS treatment for 24 h can significantly promote the mRNA expression of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR. Compared with the LPS model group, PPN significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR (p < 0.01). The mRNA expression level of higher concentration polysaccharide group was significantly higher than that of other concentration group (p < 0.01). The level of mRNA expression in cells was dose-dependent with the PPN concentration. The results showed that PPN played an anti-inflammatory role by down regulating the mRNA expression of\nPI3K, Akt, and mTOR. More data could see the Supplementary material.\nProtein expression levels analysis Western blot was used to analyze the effect of PPN on key protein expression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. From Figure 8, compared with LPS model group, PPN groups significantly inhibited the protein expression of p-pI3k, p-Akt and pmTOR (p < 0.01). The protein expression level of high-dose polysaccharide group was significantly lower than that in lowdose group (p < 0.01). And the protein expression level was dose-dependent with PPN concentration. PPN could downregulate p-PI3K expression level, blocking PI3K/AKT signal, decreasing phosphorylation AKT protein level, leading to the decrease expression level of p-mTOR. Thereby the secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 were down regulated which reduced the inflammatory reaction. In conclusion, PPN can regulate inflammatory cytokines through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. From structural analysis of SPN and PPN, it is obvious that phosphorylation has changed the structure of SPN. Apparently, due to the structure changed, the biological function of SPN\nFrontiers in Nutrition 12 frontiersin.org\nand PPN are different. In antioxidant activity experiments, the free radical scavenging rate of PPN was significantly stronger than that of SPN (p < 0.05). In cell model experiments, PPN always has significantly better anti-inflammatory effect on RAW 264.7 cells induced by LPS than SPN (p < 0.01), especially at same concentration. After substitution of phosphate group, phosphate group replaced some hydroxy groups on original chain of SPN, resulting in changes on its structure which made more hydroxy groups expose (64, 65). In addition, the changes of molecular weight, monosaccharide ratio, and molecular configuration of PPN might affect its biological activity (66). Thus, the biological function of phosphorylated polysaccharide improved.\nPI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is one of the important signaling pathways of the inflammatory response, which can regulate the activation of signal kinase and the expression of downstream gene and proteins to inhibit the inflammatory response of cells (67, 68). In this study, the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism of PPN was analyzed by the gene and protein expression levels of PI3K, Akt and mTOR. PI3K is an inositol kinase and act as a Biomarker to regulate cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. PPN significantly down-regulated the PI3K gene and protein expression levels (p < 0.01). Akt is an important downstream factor of PI3K, and lower p-PI3K protein level could lead to Akt phosphorylation level drop. This indicated that PPN blocked PI3K/Akt pathway signals and reduced the protein expression level of p-Akt at threonine 308 site of Akt, which lead to the blocking of p-Akt\ndownstream signal. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a downstream target of Akt. The protein expression of p-Akt was blocked, resulting in the inhibition of mTOR activity. Collectively, PPN can down-regulate the secretion level of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. However, the structure-function relationship of phosphorylated polysaccharide and the anti-inflammatory interaction of other pathways are still unclear, which need further research."
