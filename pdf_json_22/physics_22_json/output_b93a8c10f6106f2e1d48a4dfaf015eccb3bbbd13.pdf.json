Black hole feedback is said to egulate the gas and thereby control the star formation (e.g. Silk & ees 1998 ; Sijacki et al. 2007 ; Di Matteo et al. 2008 ; Schaye et al. 010 ; Gaspari, Ruszkowski & Oh 2013 , and references therein) nd thus establish/explain the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation. 1 Despite early vidence for a non-linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation (e.g. Laor 1998 , 2001 ; andel 1999 ; Salucci et al. 2000 ), there has been a tendency to cling o the simplicity of the original trend.

Clues that something was amiss with the notion of a nearinear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation were presented in Graham ( 2012 ), which eported a steeper near-quadratic relation for spheroids with a S \u0301ersic 1963 ) light profile 3 and a near-linear relation for spheroids with a ore-S \u0301ersic light profile 4 (Graham et al. 2003 ). This work was built on key tip-off in the final paragraph of Graham ( 2007 ) 5 and was later xpressed as a (cool gas)-rich versus (cool g as)-poor g alaxy sequence n Graham & Scott ( 2013 ) and Scott, Graham & Schombert ( 2013 ). raham & Scott ( 2015 ) revealed that the near-quadratic relation also ppeared to encompass active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with virial\n2005 ).

With impro v ed data, Sa v orgnan et al. 2016 ) found that the distributions in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram were etter described by a \u2018blue sequence\u2019 for late-type galaxies (LTGs) which are all S \u0301ersic galaxies \u2013 and a \u2018red sequence\u2019 for earlyype galaxies (ETGs), which can be S \u0301ersic galaxies or core-S \u0301ersic alaxies. This red versus blue sequence was later emphasised by thers, including van den Bosch ( 2016 ) and Dullo et al. ( 2020 ). Doubling the sample size of spiral galaxies used by Sa v orgnan et al. 2016 ), Davis, Graham & Cameron ( 2019 ) could better constrain the bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation for the LTGs, finding a slope of 2.17 \u00b1 0.32 o 2 . 44 + 0 . 35 \u22120 . 31 depending on the regression analysis used. Doubling he sample size of ETGs used by Sa v orgnan et al. ( 2016 ), Sahu, raham & Davis ( 2019a ) measured a slope of 1.27 \u00b1 0.07 for he ETGs but crucially explained why this was misleading. Sahu t al. ( 2019a ) and Sa v orgnan & Graham ( 2016 ) knew which ETGs ere (pure) elliptical galaxies and which were lenticular or ellicular 7 alaxies. Separating the ETGs into those with and without discs, ahu et al. ( 2019a ) revealed that they followed separate M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph elations with similar slopes ( \u22481.9 \u00b1 0.2, based on M \u2217/ L 3.6 = 0.6) ut offset by an order of magnitude in M bh . Therefore, as Sahu t al. ( 2019a ) explained, published slopes for the near-linear M bh \u2013 \u2217,sph relation, i.e. the \u2018red-sequence\u2019, are dependent on the sample\u2019s rbitrary number of ETGs with and without discs. See for example raham ( 2007 , with a slope of 0.93 \u00b1 0.10), Kormendy & Ho 2013 , with a slope of 1.16 \u00b1 0.08), Saglia et al. ( 2016 , with a lope of 0.846 \u00b1 0.064), and Sa v orgnan et al. ( 2016 , with a slope f 1.04 \u00b1 0.10). The slope is not a measure of physical importance as has been thought and reported for o v er a quarter of a century eg arding g alaxy/black hole coev olution \u2013 b ut rather a reflection of he sample selection. This revelation has been shown to impact black ole correlations involving not just the spheroid\u2019s stellar mass but also he spheroid\u2019s size (Sahu, Graham & Davis 2020 ) and the spheroid\u2019s ange of density measures (Sahu, Graham & Davis 2022a ).\nThis ne w kno wledge is important because it re writes our unerstanding of the interplay between spheroids and their central assive black holes. This realisation was refined by performing ulticomponent decompositions of the galaxy light, with recourse to inematic information and accounting for distinct physical entities uch as bars, rings, bulges, and discs detected in the images and the ourier harmonic analysis of the isophotes (Ciambur 2015 ). Here, ith updated data, we offer a likely explanation for the offset between he relations followed by elliptical and ellicular/lenticular galaxies. e also raise some of the ensuing implications. In particular, we ore clearly elucidate the origin and \u2018red herring\u2019 nature of the nearinear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation in regard to understanding the (limited aretaker) role for AGN feedback in elliptical galaxies.\nWe previously used a simple conversion of starlight-to-mass in ur galaxy-morphology-dependent scaling diagrams: specifically, \u2217/L \u2217, 3 . 6 \u03bcm = 0 . 6 (Meidt et al. 2014 ). 8 , 9 Such an approach meshes\nNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\nVirial masses were derived using a virial factor f = 2.8 (Graham et al. 2011 ). Ellicular galaxy is the name given by Graham, Ciambur & Sa v orgnan 2016b ) to the ES galaxy type introduced by Liller ( 1966 ). They have ntermediate-scale discs which do not dominate the light at large radii, in ontrast to the familiar lenticular (S0) galaxies whose large-scale discs do Graham 2019 ). This was based on a Chabrier ( 2003 ) \u2018initial mass function\u2019. In practice, while M \u2217/ L obs, 3.6 = 0.6 was used for the ETGs (Sahu et al. 019a ), a lower value of M \u2217/ L obs, 3.6 = 0.453 was applied to the LTGs (Davis t al. 2019 ) because the observed luminosity at 3.6 \u03bcm includes both starlight nd the glow of warm dust. This reduced ratio encapsulated the mean ratio \u2217, 3.6 / L obs.3.6 \u2248 0.75 for LTGs (Querejeta et al. 2015 ).\nS r c c J \u2018 g g\n1\nm p\nJanuary 2024\nell with the notion that many compact \u2018red nuggets\u2019 at redshifts \u223c 2.5 \u00b1 1 (both massive and not so massive) have become the ulges of some of today\u2019s lenticular and spiral galaxies (Graham, ullo & Sa v orgnan 2015 ; de la Rosa et al. 2016 ; Graham et al. 017 ; Hon et al. 2022 ). Such an origin for these bulges would make hem old, as Peletier & Balcells ( 1996 ) and MacArthur, Gonz \u0301alez & ourteau ( 2009 ) reported, and therefore require a high mass-to-light atio. Ho we ver, not e very bulge needs to be old. Here, we explore olour-dependent M \u2217/ L obs, 3.6 ratios for a sample of \u223c100 galaxies re-observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope and close enough to esolve their bulges ( R e 2 arcsec). That is, we allow for departures rom the assumption that all the bulges have the same M \u2217/ L \u2261 \u2217 ratio. Here, we use a B \u2212 V colour-dependent mass-to-light atio prescription to derive the stellar masses. Appendix A offers an lternative optical-NIR prescription for the \u03d2\u2217 ratio based on the V [3.6] colour. It provides an analysis less sensitive to star formation given that star formation may be more reflective of the disc than the pheroid).\nIn Section 2 , we summarise the salient features of our galaxy ample and describe the prescription for deriving their colourependent M \u2217/ L obs, 3.6 ratios. We have also updated a few black hole asses, some spheroid luminosities, and many galaxy distances, lightly impacting the black hole masses and absolute magnitudes. e provide a data table of final values with sufficient information o trace the origin of the data readily. In Section 3 , we present the bh \u2013M \u2217,sph and M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal diagrams and relations as a function of alaxy morphology (E, ES/S0, and S). Section 3.3 presents the size\u2013mass relation for our sample of pheroids and uses this to reveal how dry mergers, and the transition rom bulges to E galaxies, naturally produce the offset M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph nd M bh \u2013R e,sph relations for E galaxies relative to the bulges in ES/S0 alaxies and also the offset between ES/S0 and E galaxies in the M bh \u2013 \u2217,gal diagram. Section 4.1 explains the apparent overmassive and ndermassive black holes (in bulges) relative to the original nearinear relation, with Section 4.1.1 presenting the location of relic red nuggets\u2019 at the top of the bulge sequence. The stripped S0 alaxy M32 \u2013 the prototype for the \u2018compact elliptical\u2019 galaxy class is discussed in Section 4.2 . Section 4.3 identifies and discusses hat may be the primary bi v ariate black hole relation in the M bh \u2013 \u2217,sph diagram. Section 4.4 then discusses the galaxy stellar mass unction and the (moot) role of AGN feedback in shaping it instead f potentially just maintaining it. Finally, several other implications re briefly mentioned in Section 4.5 .\nIt is important to note that the authors have been mindful of using he strict interpretation of morphological terms in this paper. An lliptical (E) galaxy has no substantial disc other than perhaps a mall nuclear disc, whereas ellicular (ES) and lenticular (S0) galaxies ave an intermediate-scale and a large-scale disc, respectively. The xpression ETG is used to generically refer to the E, ES, and 0 galaxies without a spiral pattern, while the expression LTG efers to spiral (S) and irregular (Irr) galaxies. This notation is onfined to high-surface brightness galaxies that define the galaxy lassification grid seen in Graham ( 2019 ) and built on the Aitken\u2013 eans\u2013Lundmark\u2013Hubble galaxy sequence discussed there. The term spheroid\u2019 refers to both an elliptical galaxy and the bulge of a disc alaxy, while the term bulge refers to the bulges of S, ES, and S0 alaxies but not E galaxies. The only (mild) confusion 10 to this\n0 Zwicky ( 1966 ) pointed out that these elliptical-like galaxies are notably ore compact than the more commonly known \u2018elliptical galaxies\u2019 \u2013 many f which turned out to be lenticular galaxies with large-scale discs.\nn u n b o\n2\n2\nD s o i i p a t d o f \u2018 f w G m c i fi d w g i\nS \u2018 l s S w a p a g T l e\n1\nt r i 1\n( G ( 1\ni N ( A S\ni g H\ns 2 d e i w D w 1 h\nd b w a e d t t r i a z\nu 3 t a g s R T d t t\nw n o N s N o\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2177/6847192 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user\nomenclature is that we will sometimes refer to relic \u2018red nuggets\u2019 \u2013 nevolved spheroidal-shaped galaxies from z \u223c 2.5 \u00b1 1 which have ot acquired a large-scale disc of stars by today \u2013 as belonging to the ulge sequence. Why we do this will become apparent as one reads n.\nDATA A N D ANALYSIS\n.1 The sample\navis et al. ( 2019 ) and Sahu et al. ( 2019a ) provide galaxy decompoitions for LTGs and ETGs with directly measured black hole masses btained from the literature. The galaxy decomposition process nvolved the extraction of a nested set of one-dimensional profiles, ncluding the surface brightness profile, the ellipticity profile, the osition angle profile, and an array of profiles quantifying the mplitude of Fourier Harmonic terms used to describe the isophoal deviations from perfect ellipses (Ciambur 2015 ). These oneimensional profiles enable accurate two-dimensional reconstruction f the galaxy without stochastic irregularities due to, for example, star ormation or undigested neighbours. Such irregularities remain in the residual image\u2019, obtained by subtracting the smooth reconstruction rom the original image, where they can more readily be studied ithout the (often o v erwhelming) glow of the host galaxy (e.g. raham et al. 2021 ). The surface brightness profile of the geometricean axis 11 is then recreated by optimally fitting a suite of galaxy omponents. One of the advantages of this approach is that it s not limited to models in which galaxy components may have xed ellipticity and position angles, as with directly fitting the twoimensional image. For instance, a single-component triaxial bulge ith a radially-varying ellipticity and position angle profile might et broken into two or more components when attempting to model t in two dimensions.\nThe bulk of the sample was previously imaged with the Spitzer pace Telescope at a wavelength of 3.6 \u03bcm. The galaxies were disassembled\u2019 to reveal their components and better establish the uminosity of their spheroidal component. Their samples were upplemented by using optical and near-IR K s -band images when the pitzer data were either unavailable or when better spatial resolution as required to probe the bulge component. To keep things simple, nd minimize the introduction of possible biases, here we a v oid otential offsets arising from the use of a range of filters and thus dopted stellar mass-to-light ratios. We do this by solely using the alaxy sample whose structural composition was studied at 3.6 \u03bcm. his sample consists of 73 ETGs 12 plus 31 LTGs, 13 coming from the arger sample of 84 ETGs (Sahu et al. 2019a ) and 43 LTGs (Davis t al. 2019 ). The smaller fraction of LTGs with useful Spitzer data\n1 The geometric-mean axis, also know as the \u2018equi v alent axis\u2019 R eq , is given by he geometric-mean of the major (a) and minor (b) axis. These R eq = \u221a ab adii are equivalent to a circularised version of a galaxy\u2019s quasi-elliptical sophotes. 2 This sample of 73 ETGs is comprised of 40 from Sa v orgnan & Graham 2016 ), of which three (NGC: 821; 1399; and 3377) are remodelled in raham & Sahu ( 2022 ), plus 33 from Sahu et al. ( 2019a ), of which two NGC 2787 and NGC 5419) are remodelled in Graham & Sahu ( 2022 ). 3 Davis et al. ( 2019 , their table 3) contains 28 galaxies with Spitzer data, ncluding NGC 4395 and NGC 6926 which are bulgeless, and including GC 224 taken from Sa v orgnan & Graham ( 2016 ). Two of these 28 NGC 1320 and NGC 4699) are remodelled in Graham & Sahu ( 2022 ). further three galaxies (NGC 2273, NGC 4945, and UGC 3789) from a v orgnan & Graham ( 2016 ) are included, taking the tally to 31.\ni i s w a b ( u i C\n1\n1\nG\non 19 January 2024\ns a consequence of the need to resolve the bulge component of the alaxy. As such, more LTGs than ETGs had previously required ubble Space Telescope ( HST ) data. In passing, it is noted that the peanut-shell-shaped structures asociated with buckled bars (Combes & Sanders 1981 ; Athanassoula 005 ; Ciambur & Graham 2016 ) \u2013 sometimes referred to as \u2018pseuobulges\u2019 \u2013 were either modelled as a \u2018barlens\u2019 (e.g. Laurikainen t al. 2011 ; Sahu et al. 2019a , their fig. 3) or ef fecti vely folded nto the Ferrers bar component during the galaxy decomposition, hich can be seen for every galaxy in Sa v orgnan & Graham ( 2016 ), avis et al. ( 2019 ), and Sahu et al. ( 2019a ). As noted abo v e, e revisited the decomposition of seven of these (73 + 31 = ) 04 galaxies in Graham & Sahu ( 2022 ), and we use the results ere. The distances, shown in Table 1 , are regarded as luminosity istances. As such, the small correction for cosmological surface rightness dimming, 2.5log (1 + z) 4 , is (implicitly) applied when e convert the 3.6 \u03bcm apparent magnitudes, m , \u2013 given in the bo v e four papers \u2013 into absolute magnitudes, M , using the xpression m \u2212 M = 25 + 5 log D L , where D L is the luminosity istance in Mpc. No Galactic extinction correction has been applied o the 3.6 \u03bcm data because any excess emission from dust in he Milky Way glowing at 3.6 \u03bcm would have ef fecti vely been emo v ed during the sky-subtraction procedure (see Section 2.2.1 n Sahu et al. 2019a ). Finally, no K -correction or evolutionry corrections were applied given the small redshifts, typically \u2248 0.01\u20130.02.\nThe spheroid and galaxy absolute magnitudes were expressed in nits of solar luminosity using M , 3 . 6 = 6 . 02 (AB mag), equal to .26 (Vega mag). These were then converted into stellar masses using he prescription described in the following subsection. These masses ppear in Table 1 , along with the references to where one can see each alaxy\u2019s decomposition. These references are also the source for the izes of the spheroids, quantified using the ef fecti ve half-light radius, e,sph , measured along the \u2018equi v alent axis\u2019, R eq (see footnote 11). he masses for the black holes, updated according to the new galaxy istances, are also provided in Table 1 . Unless an update is indicated, he nearly 100 references for these black hole masses can be traced hrough Sahu et al. ( 2020 ).\nF ollowing the e xclusion of mergers by Kormendy & Ho ( 2013 ), e exclude from the upcoming Bayesian linear regressions, but ot the plots, one LTG plus four ETGs previously identified by thers as somewhat unrelaxed mergers (NGC 2960 plus NGC 1194, GC 1316, NGC 5018, and NGC 5128). We additionally exclude the tripped galaxy NGC 4342 (Blom et al. 2014 ) and the dwarf galaxy GC 404 (Mirach\u2019s Ghost: Nguyen et al. 2017 ). 14 NGC 404 is the nly galaxy in our sample with M bh < 10 6 M , thereby making t vulnerable to potentially biasing the analyses due to the weight t may have in torquing the regression lines.

( 1991 ), as listed in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic atabase (NED), 16 and then corrected these for Galactic extinction ased on the near-infrared maps of Schlafly & Finkbeiner ( 2011 ), gain, as provided by NED. These Johnson\u2013Cousins B and V agnitudes are Vega magnitudes and benefit from having been i) derived from wide field-of-view imaging from which the skyackground was readily available, and (ii) taken in both the Northern nd Southern hemisphere, thereby capturing most of our sample. For hree ETGs (NGC 6251, NGC 5252, and NGC 7052), and three LTGs IC 2560, NGC 253, and NGC 2960), either the B - or the V -band agnitude was not available. For these three ETGs we assigned a B V colour of 0.9, and for these three LTGs we assigned a B \u2212 V olour of 0.7. In passing, we recognise that spheroid colours, rather han galaxy colours, would be adv antageous. Ho we ver, this would ncompass considerable additional work, requiring multicomponent ecomposition of two optical bands. Moreo v er, while both LTGs and TGs can have colour gradients \u2013 i.e. varying colour with radius, hich can be due to the bulge-to-disc transition \u2013 our sample is ominated by early-type spirals (Sa\u2013Sb) and ETGs (E-S0) for which he bulge and disc colours within individual galaxies may not be too issimilar (Peletier & Balcells 1996 ). The (Galactic extinction)-corrected B T \u2212 V T galaxy colour, herefter B \u2212 V , is shown in Fig. 1 and provided in Table 1 . It was used o obtain the stellar mass-to-light ratio at 3.6 \u03bcm as follows. We tarted with the ( B \u2212 V )-dependent expression for the K -band M \u2217/ L K atio taken from table 6 of Into & Portinari ( 2013 ). It is based on ealistic dusty models, designed for \u2018samples that include a range of orphologies, intrinsic colours, and random inclinations\u2019. It is such hat\nlog ( M \u2217/L K ) = 0 . 866( B \u2212 V ) \u2212 0 . 926 , (1) hich is reportedly based on the Kroupa ( 1998 ) \u2018initial mass funcion\u2019 (IMF), 17 and good for 0.5 < B \u2212 V < 1.1. Into & Portinari ( 2013 )\nNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\n6 ht tp://nedwww.ipac.calt ech.edu 7 The IMF is the histogram of stellar birth masses.\n2\nT p\neport a \u00b1 0.1 dex (25 per cent) uncertainty on these M \u2217/ L K ratios. As hey noted, the combination of dust attenuation (dimming the optical\nagnitudes) and reddening (of the B \u2212 V colour) somewhat cancel ach other to provide M \u2217/ L K ratios that are consistent with those erived from their simpler (dust-free) galaxy model. This partial ulling behaviour was noted by Bell et al. ( 2003 ) and can be seen in river et al. ( 2007 , their fig. 13), when assuming the dust models of opescu et al. ( 2000 ). Here, we convert equation ( 1 ) into a 3.6 \u03bcm equation using the ollowing relation taken from the start of Section 5.6 in Schombert t al. ( 2019 , see their fig. 7):\nK \u2212 m 3 . 6 = 0 . 54 \u2212 0 . 42( B \u2212 V ) . aking 2.5 times the logarithm of ( M \u2217/ L K ) L K = ( M \u2217/ L 3.6 ) L 3.6 and ubstituting in this m K \u2212 m 3.6 colour term, one obtains log ( M \u2217/L 3 . 6 ) = 1 . 034( B \u2212 V ) \u2212 1 . 142 . (2)\nhile the use of individual m K \u2212 m 3.6 colours rather than the abo v e ean ( B \u2212 V )-dependent relation might seem preferable, in practice t can become problematic due to the different method used to etermine the total K -band and Spitzer magnitudes (e.g. Scott et al. 013 , their fig. 2 ). As noted abo v e, Into & Portinari ( 2013 ) initially deriv ed a colourependent M \u2217/ L relation for a less complicated galaxy model based n composite stellar populations. This may be more applicable for he ETGs, and is such that log ( M \u2217/ L K ) = 1.055( B \u2212 V ) \u2212 1.066, for .2 < B \u2212 V < 1.0. Morphing this in the same manner as done to quation ( 1 ) gives the relation\nlog ( M \u2217/L 3 . 6 ) = 1 . 223( B \u2212 V ) \u2212 1 . 282 .

To convert from the Kroupa ( 1998 ) IMF 18 (spanning 0.1\u2013 00 M ) \u2013 which was used by Into & Portinari ( 2013 ) and is inherent n the previous equations \u2013 to an alternative IMF, the logarithm of he M \u2217/ L ratio needs to be adjusted by a (near) constant factor (e.g.\nadau & Dickinson 2014 ). This is shown by Flynn et al. ( 2006 , heir fig. 12), where it can be seen that switching to the Salpeter IMF spanning 0.1\u2013100 M ) 19 requires adding 0.225 dex to the above quations. Conversion to other assumed IMFs can be done following he offsets provided by, for example, Bell et al. ( 2003 , their p.306) r Bernardi et al. ( 2010 , their table 2). In this paper, we adopt the roupa ( 2002 ) IMF, detailed further in Kroupa et al. ( 2013 ), and have herefore added 0.225 dex and subtracted 0.30 dex from equation ( 2 ) o give\nlog ( M \u2217/L 3 . 6 ) = 1 . 034( B \u2212 V ) \u2212 1 . 067 . (4) ollowing Into & Portinari ( 2013 ), we assign a 25 per cent uncertainty o these M \u2217/ L 3.6 ratios. In the same way, equation ( 3 ) becomes\nlog ( M \u2217/L 3 . 6 ) = 1 . 223( B \u2212 V ) \u2212 1 . 207 . (5) e have included this additional relation (equation 5 ), shown in the ight-hand panel of Fig. 1 , simply to demonstrate that it yields similar \u2217/ L 3.6 \u2261 \u03d2\u2217, 3.6 ratios to those from equation ( 4 ). We proceed using equation ( 4 ) to derive the spheroid and galaxy tellar masses for all. In Table 1 , we list the spheroid and galaxy tellar-masses, and the black hole masses taken from the compilation n Sahu et al. ( 2020 ), unless indicated otherwise. The luminosity istances are also tabulated here. Distances from Tonry et al. ( 2001 ) ave been reduced by \u223c4 per cent due to a 0.083 mag reduction in heir distance moduli. This arose from a 0.06 mag reduction after recalibration by Blakeslee et al. ( 2002 , their section 4.6) 20 plus 0.023 mag reduction due to a reduced distance modulus for the arge Magellanic Cloud (Pietrzy \u0301nski et al. 2019 ) involved in the nitial calibration. The black hole masses depend linearly on the ngular distance to the host galaxies, and these masses have been pdated here to reflect this. Following Sahu et al. ( 2019a , their equation 9), the quoted ncertainties on the stellar masses include three uncertainties added n quadrature. These relate to the distance (see Table 1 ), the M \u2217/ L atio (a 25 per cent uncertainty is suggested by Into & Portinari 2013 ), nd the apparent magnitude. Here, we use a 0.15 mag uncertainty for he galaxy magnitude, and thus also for the spheroidal component f pure elliptical galaxies. This primarily captures uncertainty in the xtrapolation of the light profile to large radii (Graham & Driver 005 , their fig. 1 ) and this value also falls in the middle of the 0.11 to + 0.18 range reported by Sa v orgnan & Graham ( 2016 , their ection 4.2.4). For those galaxies with two or more components, we ssign uncertainties reflecting the complexity of the decomposition nd thus the accuracy of the spheroid magnitude. These uncertainties ere at ele v ated le vels in Sa v orgnan & Graham ( 2016 ) and, in turn, ahu et al. ( 2019a ) because they were based on the published range f spheroid magnitudes from decompositions that, in retrospect, ere clearly in error due to, for example, missed discs or bars.\nMNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\n8 The concluding section in Kroupa ( 1998 ) notes an IMF slope \u03b11 = 1.3, and 2 = 2.2 from their previous sections, along with \u03b13 = 2.7 for representing he IMF of the Galactic field. 9 The mass limits within which the IMF used by Into & Portinari ( 2013 ) was ntegrated are stated in Portinari, Sommer-Larsen & Tantalo ( 2004 ). 0 We opt not to use the attempted refinement offered by equation ( A1 ) and g. 7 in Blakeslee et al.

We dopt the following grading schema for the uncertainties on the agnitudes: Grade 0 (0.15 mag: single-component galaxy); Grade 1 0.2 mag: ES galaxies and those with only minor inner components); rade 1.5 (0.25 mag: typically a clean bulge + disc fit, or if several rcseconds of inner data were excluded, or if intracluster light (ICL) s present); Grade 2 (0.40 mag: usually a bar + bulge + disc fit); Grade (0.55 mag: typically many components present). The forthcoming egressions were, ho we ver, tested and found to be stable (at the 1 \u03c3 evel) to a broad range of uncertainties. In Appendix A , we repeat the forthcoming analysis of Section 3 sing an alternative optical-infrared colour-dependent prescription or the mass-to-light ratio, taken from Schombert et al. ( 2022 ). his additional analysis supports one of our primary conclusions: hat violent, disc-destroying, mergers of (red) bulge + disc galaxies e.g. Naab, Khochf ar & Burk ert 2006 ) produce an offset population f elliptical galaxies in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram. Neither the initial bulge) nor the secondary (elliptical galaxy) relations have a nearinear slope in this diagram.\nRESULTS\n.1 The M bh \u2013M \u2217,spheroid and M bh \u2013M \u2217,galaxy diagrams\nn Fig. 2 , we show the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram, using equation ( 4 ), for he three morphological types: E, ES/S0, and S.

The first point we make is that the lope of the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation for bulges in either S galaxies or S/S0 galaxies, and the slope of the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation for elliptical alaxies, is neither equal to 1 nor close to it.

For a iven spheroid stellar-mass, Fig. 3 reveals different ( M bh / M \u2217,sph ) atios for elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies. This ifferent ratio has received little attention in the literature and has ev er been e xplained. The arrows in this diagram trace the expected o v ement due to simple, equal-mass, dry mergers of galaxies with ome illustrative bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios, B / T . The merger f two E galaxies produces a shift to the right, while a merger of two dentical S0 galaxies with a typical B / T = 0.25 (e.g. Laurikainen, alo & Buta 2005 ) produces a considerable shift to the lower right. onsidering the mean regression lines, the elliptical galaxies appear o be built, on average, by just one major merger. One can also ppreciate how brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), which are typically galaxies, occupy the right-hand side of the distribution in this iagram. Fig. 4 shows, for different morphological types, the trend between lack hole mass and B / T , or more precisely, the spheroid-to-total tellar mass ratio. B / T is not some near-constant value for all S0 alaxies; a range of ratios is known (e.g. Graham & Worley 2008 ). side from the exclusions mentioned in Section 2.1 , here we exclude he ES/S0 galaxy NGC 4762 given the excessive weight its small / T ratio has on our sample\u2019s regression. 21 Fig. 4 reveals that the S0 alaxies with the lower B / T ratios have smaller black hole masses, as s observed among the S galaxies. These trends aid our understanding f the transition from the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram (Fig. 2 ) to the M bh \u2013 \u2217,gal diagram (Fig. 5 ). For a given black hole mass, the smaller / T ratios in the LTGs imply that there will be a steeper M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal elation for LTGs than for ES/S0 galaxies. That is, given the greater isc-to-bulge flux ratios and smaller spheroid masses when moving rom Sa to Sc galaxies, the spiral galaxies transition to a steeper bh \u2013M \u2217,gal relation than the early-type disc galaxies (ES/S0). This s seen in Fig. 5 , in which the M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal relation for the E galaxies s basically 22 the same as the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation for the E galaxies. he M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal relation for the E galaxies is, ho we ver, of fset from he M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal relation for the ES/S0 galaxies. The darker shading n this diagram reveals that the relations are not consistent with each ther at the 1 \u03c3 level. This reveals that the E and ES/S0 galaxies re not offset from each other in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram due to the xclusion of the non-spheroid stellar mass.\nIn Fig. 6 , we present the ( M bh / M \u2217,gal )\u2013M \u2217,gal diagram. As noted n Sahu et al. ( 2019a ), one can approximate the ETGs (E/ES/S0) ith a single relation in this diagram if, for example, one is pursuing ough predictions for black hole masses in other ETGs. Ho we ver, here is more detail to it than this, and this detail is one of the keys o understanding the black hole mass scaling diagrams.\nAs with Fig. 2 , one can again see that the addition of the nonpheroid stellar mass, primarily from the disc and bar, does not align he lenticular and elliptical galaxies. This reveals that the offset in he M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram, between the bulge component of ES/S0 alaxies and E galaxies, is not an artefact of separating/reducing the ight in some ETGs (those with discs) but not others (those without) hen we were plotting the spheroid stellar mass. The arrows in Fig. 6 eveal that the distribution of elliptical galaxies is readily explained f they are built from the dry merger of lenticular galaxies, which\n1 We do not wish to imply that S0 galaxies with low B / T ratios are in error, nly that this B / T data point for NGC 4762 interferes with the current mapping etween Figs 2 and 5 . 2 Nuclear discs and additional, possibly undigested, galaxy components esult in a slight difference.\nr t\n2\nt\ns widely thought to be the case, and also the merger of elliptical alaxies. 23 Ho we ver, what is not well recognised is the ensuing offset etween the E and ES/S0 galaxies in various black hole mass scaling iagrams populated with real data. Here, we have:\n(i) built on Sahu et al. ( 2019a ) which established that there is not single (fundamental) M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation for ETGs;\n(ii) revealed that mergers have not built a near-linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph elation, due to the folding-in of the disc/bar stellar mass, reducing he M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph ratio; and\nMNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\n3 While we have used simple equal-mass mergers to illustrate S0-to-E, and Eo-E, transformations, there are other options, such as several minor mergers.\nM\nm t\ni\n3\nW o 2 l a A l A t i d a a D e\nA p u a M p t S d W d i h c s a a\no a C B f 2 F 1 B 1 t\n2\n2\ns b s l N\n1 r l a a e S E S g ( r\nr w r C j C M t r w b r t 0 K v a o M s o t t p i h g i g S\nc a R m i (\ng s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2177/6847192 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\n(iii) established that a single M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal relation is not a fundaental relation for ETGs, with merger -b uilt E galaxies offset from\nhe S0 galaxies.\nWe will return to these points with additional supportive evidence n Section 3.3 .\n.2 The M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph and M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal relations and ratios\ne have used hierarchical Bayesian model fitting through the statef-the-art platform for statistical modelling known as STAN (Team 016 ; Carpenter et al. 2017 ). 24 The statistical model used for our inear regression considered uncertainties in both variables and is imed at obtaining a symmetric relation between the two variables. bi v ariate normal density was used to represent the distribution of atent (true) log M \u2217 and log M bh values that might occur in our sample. s noted in Davis et al. ( 2019 ), \u201cthis is conceptually equi v alent to he generati ve frame w ork sk etched by Hogg, Bovy & Lang ( 2010 ), n which the observed data points are imagined to be drawn from a istribution centred around a `line of best fit\u2019, except that here we llow Bayesian \u0300 shrinkage\u2019 by estimating the underlying distribution long the line rather than keeping this as an improper uniform prior\u201d. etails of the statistical model framework are described in Davis t al. ( 2019 , their appendix A). The best-fitting relations are shown in Table 2 , along with the slope,\n, and intercept, B , at the normalization point. The normalization oint of, for example, the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation is \u03c5(5 \u00d7 10 10 M ). If sing equation ( 4 ) to convert light into stellar mass and thus derive value of M \u2217,sph for use in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph equation (to predict bh ), one has that \u03c5 = 1. If, ho we ver, a dif ferent light-to-mass ratio rescription is preferred and used to derive one\u2019s estimate of M \u2217,sph , hen one needs to apply the appropriate value of \u03c5, as illustrated in ahu et al. ( 2019a , see their fig. 4 and equations 6 to 8) for colourependent light-to-mass ratio prescriptions in different passbands. hile we could drop this \u03c5 term from our equations, as typically one before Davis et al. ( 2019 , see their equations 10 and 11), its nclusion serves to remind readers that a specific prescription for \u03d2\u2217 as been used to derive the equation and that they need to apply a onversion if using an alternate prescription. The root mean square catter, rms , in the log M bh direction is also tabulated for reference, lthough it is noted that this is not the quantity that is minimised with Bayesian regression.\nWe have also applied three additional linear regression codes to ur data, and found consistent results with our primary Bayesian nalysis. F or e xample, the Bisector re gression from the Bi v ariate orrelated Errors and Intrinsic Scatter ( BCES ) routine (Akritas & ershady 1996 ) gave the following slopes in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram or the E, ES/S0, and S galaxies: 1.62 \u00b1 0.17; 1.49 \u00b1 0.13; and .19 \u00b1 0.33. Using a symmetrical treatment 25 of the modifiedITEXY routine from Tremaine et al. ( 2002 ) yielded slopes equal to .65 \u00b1 0.12, 1.53 \u00b1 0.11, and 2.20 \u00b1 0.26, respectively . Finally , the ayesian LINMIX code from Kelly ( 2007 ) yielded: 1.61 \u00b1 0.14 (E); .52 \u00b1 0.13 (ES/S0); and 2.14 \u00b1 0.34 (S). From Table 2 , we have hat M bh \u221d M 2 . 25 \u00b10 . 39 \u2217, sph for the bulges of the spiral galaxies. This has\nNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\n4 https:// mc-stan.org/ 5 While the modified- FITEXY routine performs a non-symmetrical regresion of a sample of ( X , Y ) data pairs, a symmetrical treatment can be obtained y running the regression twice, the second time with the Y and X variables wapped around with each other. The bisector of the resulting two regression ines provides an expression which ef fecti vely treats the data equally (e.g. o vak, F aber & Dekel 2006 ; Graham & Driv er 2007b , their section 3.1.1).\nm w\n2\nc 2\nm a\n\u03c3 uncertainties which o v erlap with those from the steeper relation eported by Davis et al.

It appears that the bulges of spiral galaxies define steeper M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation than the bulges of S0 galaxies. Three volutionary pathways for the spiral galaxy bulges are offered in ection 4 . In fair agreement with the relations found here for the TGs using the hierarchical Bayesian model fitting (see Table 2 ), ahu et al. ( 2019a ) report a slope of 1.86 \u00b1 0.20 for 36 ES/S0 alaxies and 1.90 \u00b1 0.20 for 40 E galaxies. As seen in Sahu et al. 2019a ), the present sample of E galaxies trace a relation which is oughly parallel to that defined by the bulges of S0 galaxies.\nUsing multicomponent decompositions, Sa v orgnan et al. ( 2016 ) eported a median M bh / M \u2217,sph value of \u223c0.68 per cent for 45 ETGs, hich they thought followed a near-linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation. This esult was based on the use of an M \u2217/ L 3.6 ratio of \u223c0.60 and a habrier ( 2003 ) IMF. Bernardi et al. ( 2010 ) suggest a reduction of ust 0.05 dex to the logarithm of \u03d2\u2217 ( \u2261 M \u2217/ L ) to convert from the habrier ( 2003 ) IMF to the Kroupa ( 2002 ) IMF. Therefore, this bh / M \u2217,sph mass ratio of 0.68 per cent increases to 0.76 per cent for he Kroupa ( 2002 ) IMF. This is comparable to the median M bh / M \u2217,sph atio for core-S \u0301ersic galaxies reported in Graham & Scott ( 2013 ), hich was obtained using M \u2217/ L K = 0.8 from Bell et al. ( 2003 ) and ased on a diet-Salpeter IMF. Their reported K -band mass-to-light atio of 0.49 drops by 0.15 dex, or to M \u2217/ L K = 0.57, when switching o the Kroupa ( 2002 ) IMF. Consequently, their M bh / M \u2217,sph ratio of .49 per cent increases to 0.69 per cent once calibrated against the roupa ( 2002 ) IMF, and is thus in good agreement with the abo v e alue of 0.76 per cent. 26 However, as Sahu et al. ( 2019a ) uncovered, nd as can be seen in Fig. 3 , this near-constant M bh / M \u2217,sph mass ratio f \u223c0.7 per cent for ETGs is misleading. Individual ratios, at a fixed \u2217,sph , differ by an order of magnitude depending on whether the ystem is an S0 or an E galaxy. Furthermore, the ratio can vary by an rder of magnitude within either of these two galaxy types. Turning o the galaxy masses, Fig. 6 illustrates that while the S galaxies tend o have lower M bh / M \u2217,gal ratios than the ETGs in our sample, due in art to the greater disc-to-bulge ratios in S galaxies, there is more to t than that. On average, for a given M bh / M \u2217,gal ratio, the E galaxies ave higher masses than the S0 galaxies, which is expected if S0 alaxies merge to form E galaxies. This observation also expresses tself as a lower M bh / M \u2217,gal ratio in E galaxies than S0 galaxies at a iven galaxy mass, modulo the scarcity of low-mass E and high-mass 0 galaxies \u2013 another signature of the dry merger phenomena. In passing, we note that it almost goes without saying that applying onsistent \u03d2\u2217 ratios between different studies is vital for a v oiding rtificial mismatches such as that reported in Shankar et al. ( 2016 ). ealised some years ago, and detailed in Sahu et al. ( 2022a , b ), this ismatch led us to introduce the mass-to-light conversion term, \u03c5, n Davis et al. ( 2019 ). 27 This was developed further in Sahu et al. 2019a ) and explains the \u03c5 term included in Table 2 .\nHere, we find M bh / M \u2217,sph = 0.0018 (0.18 per cent) for elliptical alaxies with M \u2217,sph = 10 11 M , and 1.7 per cent for bulges of the ame stellar mass. The order of magnitude difference between these orphological types can be seen in Fig. 3 . This difference appears to iden slightly when moving to lower spheroid masses. Furthermore,\n6 We thank Peter Behroozi for pointing out this issue in 2017, surrounding larification of the adopted IMF before comparing M bh / M \u2217,sph . 7 The lower case upsilon symbol was introduced to facilitate changes to the ass-to-light ratio, \u03d2, in a similar manner to how h can enact changes to the dopted Hubble\u2013Lema \u0302 \u0131tre constant H 0 .\no e\n3\nM i e s a t t o r t ( D t s b m\ni a f g\nR T f a r i b w n n\nFigure 7.

That is, the AGNs tend to reside in normal, often isolated, piral galaxies (e.g. Grogin et al. 2005 ; Kocevski et al. 2012 ). AGNs re not particularly pre v alent during or after major mergers. Given hat elliptical galaxies have little to no star formation, it is apparent hat the gaseous processes driving growth in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram ccur in bulges. As noted by multiple studies, the black hole accretion ate relative to the star formation rate is such that it is not expected o establish a linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal relation but instead a steeper relation e.g. Seymour et al. 2012 ; LaMassa et al. 2013 ; Drouart et al. 2014 ; elvecchio et al. 2019 ). This bodes well for the steeper-than-linear rend seen for spiral galaxies in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal diagram. Should ome of the star formation be occurring in bulges, then the higher lack hole accretion rates to star formation rates in spiral galaxies ay mesh well with the trend seen in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram. By considering the sizes of the spheroids, we can build a more nformed scenario for what we are witnessing in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph nd M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal diagrams. We will see how dry mergers can account or the steeper-than-linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation observed for the E alaxies.\nIn Fig. 7 , we show the effective half-light size of the spheroids, e,sph , versus their stellar mass, M \u2217,sph . These radii are given in able 1 , along with the reference showing the modelled light profile rom which the radii were measured. We used the geometric-mean xis, aka the \u2018equi v alent axis\u2019, r = \u221a ab , along which the size of the adii are equi v alent to a circularised version of the quasi-elliptical sophotes. There is no discontinuity in the R e,sph \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram etween the different types of spheroids. This continuity holds hether the spheroids coexist with a disc that either does or does ot contain a spiral pattern, or whether they exist on their own with o disc, i.e. are an elliptical galaxy.\nThe R e,sph \u2013M \u2217,sph , or equally M \u2217,sph \u2013R e,sph , relation is seen in Fig. 7 o have a slope close to unity . Curiously , there is little evidence for any road curvature in the distribution of R e,sph and M \u2217,sph . This differs rom what is seen in the M \u2217,gal \u2013R e,gal relation for ETGs (Graham t al. 2006 , their fig. 1 b) due to the presence and then dominance of iscs as one mo v es to lower masses. Not surprisingly, this near-linear lope matches that seen at the bright end of the M \u2217,gal \u2013R e,gal relation or ETGs, which is dominated by E galaxies (e.g. Graham & Worley 008 ; Krajnovi \u0301c et al. 2018 ; Dullo 2019 ; Sahu et al. 2020 , their fig. 9), .e. systems without discs. The simulations from Nipoti, Treu & olton ( 2009a ), involving elliptical galaxies undergoing minor and ajor dry merger events, build a near-linear M \u2217,gal \u2013R e,gal relation Nipoti et al. 2009b ). This relation will be explored further in Hon Graham ( 2022 ) with a sample twice that used here and having ulticomponent decompositions and a consistent set of \u03d2\u2217 ratios. In the left-hand panel of Fig. 8 , we see the black hole masses ersus the half-light radii of the host spheroids, as measured from the eometric-mean axis. Given the strong relation between the sizes and he masses of the spheroids seen in Fig. 7 , it is not too surprising that he structure in the M bh \u2013R e,sph diagram (Fig. 8 ) shows a similarity to hat seen in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram (Fig. 2 ). Using the M \u2217,sph \u2013R e,sph iagram (Fig. 7 ), one can map the expected shift in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph iagram for equal-mass mergers of S0 galaxies that produce an E alaxy. This is shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 8 , and can be nderstood in terms of the galaxies ef fecti vely folding in their disc tars to make the new E galaxy and thereby lowering the M bh / M \u2217,sph atio, as seen in Fig. 3 . This scenario also readily explains the offset etween bulges and E galaxies seen in Fig. 8 . For example, a merger f two equal-mass S0 galaxies with B/T = 0.25 (e.g. Laurikainen t al. 2005 ; Graham & Worley 2008 ) will double M bh and increase he spheroid (now elliptical galaxy) mass 8-fold once the disc light is ncorporated. In the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram, this merger mo v es a high tellar mass S0 up by 0.3 dex and across by 0.9 dex, placing it on the equence of elliptical galaxies.

The shallower relation, shown in grey, tracks an apparent \u2018red sequence\u2019 obtained by sampling some massive bulges and some elliptical galaxies. Past claims for apparently o v ermassiv e and undermassiv e black holes, relativ e to this near-linear \u2018red sequence\u2019, can be understood in terms of the host bulge belonging to the (steeper) bulge sequence.\n( i S a a e e i\n4\n4\nE b\nl d a t s e m o w A e e (\nf i c a o s a n t t w r t B o B m M i p t b c n n c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com nras/article/518/2/2177/6847192 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nbased on the Spitzer sample used here), we have that a 0.9 dex ncrease in M \u2217,sph is associated with a 0.79 dex increase in R e,sph,eq . uch an increase from a major merger event is plotted in Figs 7 nd 8 . Fig. 8 provides a previously unstated measure-of-sorts of the verage number of major mergers the E galaxies in our sample have xperienced. There is evidence here, and in Fig. 6 , that BCGs have xperienced a greater number of mergers, and this will be explored n more detail in a subsequent paper.\nDISCUSSION\n.1 Ov ermassi v e and undermassi v e black holes\narly observational bias fa v ouring the detection of systems with ig black holes led to samples dominated by elliptical galaxies and\nNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\nenticular galaxies with massive bulges. This sample selection prouced an apparent near-linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation, which steepened s lower mass black holes were gradually included. Fig. 9 reveals how his near-linear \u2018red sequence\u2019 in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram arises by ampling both massive bulges and elliptical galaxies. F or man y such lliptical galaxies, their spheroid mass may be dominated by the disc asses of their progenitor galaxies. This explains the approximately rder of magnitude lower M bh / M \u2217,sph ratio in elliptical galaxies hen compared to bulges of the same \u2018spheroid\u2019 mass (Fig. 3 ). s noted earlier, this is not because the galaxies\u2019 disc masses are xcluded from the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram; the M bh / M \u2217,gal ratio is not qual among ES/S0 and E galaxies at a given galaxy stellar-mass Fig. 6 ).\nThe notion of a \u2018red sequence\u2019 representing the underlying undamental connection between black holes and \u2018classical bulges\u2019, .e., built by mergers, introduces problems that disappear when onsidering the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram in terms of a bulge sequence nd an offset merger -b uilt population of elliptical galaxies. Most bvious is that the E galaxies do not follow the (near-linear) red equence but define a steeper non-linear relation (see Table 2 ). In ddition, the low- and high-mass bulges appear as outliers from the ear-linear \u2018red sequence\u2019, invoking a misleading perception as to he need for separate formation physics. It had led to the notion hat massive bulges and relic galaxies are a disconnected population ith o v ermassiv e black holes relativ e to galaxies on the near-linear elation (see Fig. 9 ). They are, ho we ver, not overmassi ve relati ve o the bulge sequence. Furthermore, while some black holes in CGs appear o v ermassiv e relativ e to the \u2018red sequence\u2019, they are not v ermassiv e relativ e to the elliptical galaxy M b \u2013M \u2217,sph sequence. y appreciating the role of mergers, we can understand how the orphology-dependent relationships arose in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph and bh \u2013M \u2217,gal diagrams. The near-linear red-sequence also resulted n claims that low-mass bulges were yet another disconnected opulation with undermassive black holes relative to galaxies on he red-sequence. Ho we v er, the y are not undermassiv e relativ e to the ulge sequence. We again note that while our sample of bulges does ontain members which reside below the \u2018red sequence\u2019, they are ot the peanut-shell-shaped structures associated with unstable bars, or are they nuclear or inner discs which we model with separate omponents.\n4\nT c o D d r a ( o t g Z e \u2018 s t m o t a \u2018\nh c a h c h l\nt g e t s a c\n4\nT e T ( o t d s M r d M i a\n2\nl a e\nr w\n4\nI b r a M r t 1 m G c ( I m ( P G 2 t U p\n( 4 b 2 w\nr T S o g C H r i e T a s u r I s t a t ( 2\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2177/6847192 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\n.1.1 Relic red nug g ets at the top of the bulge sequence\nhe gaseous processes that gave rise to some bulges may have ocurred long ago. Indeed, many local bulges could be the descendants f the \u2018red nuggets\u2019 observed at z \u2248 2.5 \u00b1 1 (Daddi et al. 2005 ; amjanov et al. 2011 ) and potentially now cloaked in a large-scale isc (Graham et al. 2015 ; de la Rosa et al. 2016 ; Hon et al. 2022 , and eferences therein). If any of the high- z red nuggets did not acquire disc by today \u2013 which may be likely if they started life in a protogalaxy cluster), given (i) the propensity for ram-pressure stripping f cold gas by hot gas, and (ii) the reduction in galaxy mergers due o high fly-by speeds \u2013, then they will remain a compact massive alaxy today (e.g. Zwicky 1966 ; Zwicky & Kowal 1968 ; Zwicky & wicky 1971 ; Saracco, Longhetti & Gargiulo 2010 ; Valentinuzzi t al. 2010 ; Poggianti et al. 2013 ; Trujillo et al. 2014 ). Such local compact galaxies\u2019 are also referred to as \u2018relic galaxies\u2019 if their tars are old (e.g. Ferr \u0301e-Mateu et al. 2017 ). In separating spheroid ypes, the \u2018relic galaxies\u2019 are seen not to be associated with the erger -b uilt E galaxies in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram but rather sit n the bulge sequence, with the most massive red relics located at he top. Consequently, Fig. 9 reveals how massive relic galaxies ppear to hav e o v ermassiv e black holes relative to the near-linear red sequence\u2019 but are consistent with the bulge sequence for ETGs.\nNGC 1332 is not an elliptical galaxy but a relic ES galaxy which as not acquired/built a large-scale disc. The dominant spheroidal omponent in NGC 1332 has log ( M \u2217,sph / M ) = 11.15 \u00b1 0.15 dex nd a geometric mean radius R e,sph \u2248 1.9 kpc. It has the second ighest black hole mass of the ES + S0 galaxies in our sample, and an be seen to reside at the top of the bulge sequence in Fig. 8 . We ave also labelled the ES galaxy NGC 6861 in Fig. 8 , which has og ( M \u2217,sph / M ) = 11.07 \u00b1 0.19 and R e,sph \u2248 2.6 kpc.\nIf a high- z \u2018red nugget\u2019 acquired a disc o v er time, then today he \u2018red nugget\u2019 would be the compact massive spheroid of a disc alaxy. NGC 5252, for example, likely has such a relic bulge (Sahu t al. 2019a ); and also a relic quasar (Capetti et al. 2005 ). Given he old ages of discs in massive lenticular galaxies, the bulk of their tars formed long ago, no doubt acquired through direct accretion nd mergers but also possibly via star formation in their gas discs at osmic noon (e.g. Florez et al. 2020 ).\n.1.2 Merger -b uilt BCGs\nhe creation of BCGs via (multiple) mergers produces the largest lliptical galaxies, found at the centres of galaxy groups and clusters. he steeper-than-linear M bh \u221d M 1 . 72 \u2217, sph relation seen in Bogd \u0301an et al. 2018 , their fig. 3) for BCGs is explained here as a combination f mergers folding in the disc mass and a steep origin relation for he bulges of the pre-merged progenitor galaxies in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph iagram. That is, the elliptical galaxies, which include the BCGs, 28 hould not be thought of as a departure from a near-linear M bh \u2013 \u2217,sph relation. Instead, they represent a shift to a somewhat parallel elation to that defined by the bulges of ETGs. Of course, when E + E ry mergers build new E galaxies, the evolutionary path in the M bh \u2013 \u2217,sph diagram will be along a vector with a slope of 1. One might magine that in the Universe\u2019s distant future, one would start to see linear relation for BCGs emerge from the top end of the current\n8 Our galaxy stellar-masses are derived by excluding the surrounding ICL ight, either because it was fit as a component during the galaxy decomposition nd excluded here, or because the images and light profiles were not deep nough for the ICL to have been an issue.\nt\ni G q s\nelation for the E galaxies. This is, ho we ver, something which we ill leave for the simulators.\n.2 The stripped S0 galaxy M32\nn Fig. 7 , M32 appears to the left of the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation defined by ulges in ETGs. Ho we ver, it resides within the 1 \u03c3 scatter about this elation. The slight preference to the left may reflect that the bulge, long with the disc, in M32 has been eroded by its massive neighbour, 31. This process can reduce the bulge mass and inflate its half-light adius. \u2018Compact elliptical\u2019 (cE) galaxies like M32, which have lost he gravitational tug-of-war to retain ownership of their stars (Roche 850 ; T oomre & T oomre 1972 ), stand out in the galaxy colour\u2013 agnitude diagram due to their low luminosity for their colour (e.g. raham & Soria 2019 , their fig. 11). For M32, the V \u2212 I (Vega) olour of \u223c1.2\u20131.4 mag (Lauer et al. 1998 ) implies M \u2217/ L I \u2248 3M / L Schombert et al. 2022 ), or \u223c2.4 after converting to a Kroupa ( 2002 ) MF. Coupled with 0.09 mag of Galactic extinction, the absolute agnitude for the spheroidal component of M32, M I = \u221217.0 mag Vega: Graham & Spitler 2009 ), corresponds to M \u2217 \u2248 0 . 8 \u00d7 10 9 M . erforming a multicomponent fit to M32\u2019s major-axis light profile, raham & Spitler ( 2009 ) measured an ef fecti ve half light-radius of 6.3 arcsec for the bulge component. For an ellipticity of 0.3 at his radius, this translates to an equi v alent-axis R e,sph,eq = 22 arcsec. sing a scale of 4 pc per 1 arcsec, this angular size is equal to a hysical size of 88 pc, as shown in Fig. 8 . We add the dwarf E galaxy Pox 52 (93 Mpc distant), with M bh = 3.2 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 10 5 M and M \u2217,sph = 1.2 \u00d7 10 9 M . We use R e,eq = 36 pc (Thornton et al. 2008 ), based on a minor-to-major axial ratio / a = 0.79 (Barth et al. 2004 ) and R e, maj = 490 pc (Thornton et al. 008 ). Pox 52 follows both the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph and M bh \u2013R e,sph relations ell. There is another spheroid in our sample, albeit not used in our egression analyses, with a smaller mass and size than that of M32. he dwarf S0 galaxy NGC 404 can be seen in Fig. 8 to follow the 0 galaxy sequence in the M bh \u2013R e,sph diagram but reside to the left f the S0 galaxy sequence in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram. This LINER alaxy has a bright ( r \u2248 2 arcsec) nuclear spiral pattern (compare G 611: Graham et al. 2017 ) and is encircled by a much larger I gas disc with knotty, irregular tendrils of UV hotspots and H II egions (Williams et al. 2010 ; Bresolin 2013 ). Ho we ver, this galaxy s excluded from the fitting process because its location at the lower xtremum of our data might e xcessiv ely torque the fitted relation. his becomes problematic using such a datum if its measurements re in error or if the scaling relation does not extend linearly to uch low black hole masses. Nguyen et al. ( 2017 ) reported a 3 \u03c3 pper limit to the black hole mass of 1.5 \u00d7 10 4 M , which was ecently revised to M bh = 5 . 5 + 4 . 1 \u22123 . 8 \u00d7 10 5 M (Davis et al. 2020 ). n passing, we note how this discrepancy highlights the affect of ystematic errors not captured by the small formal/random errors ypically reported for most black hole mass measurements. We also ttach a 0.5 dex uncertainty to our spheroid mass, which may be hree times less massive than our adopted value from Sahu et al. 2019a ) if this galaxy has an antitruncated disc (Graham & Sahu 022 ), resulting in a steeper inner-disc component at the expense of he bulge.\nLEDA 87000 is a galaxy that likely harbours a central ntermediate-mass black hole (Baldassare et al. 2015 ). Although raham, Ciambur & Soria ( 2016a ) observed it to follow the nearuadratic M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation followed by LTGs, inspection of ubsequent HST images reveals that the previously poorly resolved\nMNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\nM\n\u2018 a g s o o e\n4\nT s I o g S e t l g i (\nr p e m A g m c s\nt g m o t b ( M m s o\ni n d 2 d 2 a r d B c K k\n2\no i t t t b t P f t 2 m p c n d\nr o t s w t d t b g u a s M a M o\n4 a\nT f w p r a q ( m ( i t o\n30 The term \u3008 I \u3009 e is the mean intensity within R e .

This represents something of a rowing trend in which the closer one looks, the more \u2018bulges\u2019 \u2013 when imply defined as the excess of light above the inward extrapolation f an outer exponential disc \u2013 retreat by giving up ground to bars or ther features (e.g. Balcells et al. 2003 ; Erwin et al. 2003 ; Laurikainen t al. 2005 ; Hon et al. 2022 ).\n.3 The primary relation\nhe lar ger, mer ger -b uilt elliptical galaxies are seen to define a econdary, or at least subsequent, relation in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram. n terms of Darwinian evolution on a galaxy scale, they can be thought f as coming into existence via punctuated equilibrium rather than radualism. Major dry mergers between S0 galaxies, in which the 0 galaxies ef fecti vely fold in all their disc stellar mass to create an lliptical galaxy, are accompanied by a substantial o v ersized jump in he stellar mass (relative to the jump in the black hole mass) and a arge jump in the half-light size of the new spheroid, i.e. the elliptical alaxy. Such evolution explains the two prominent relations observed n the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram and the M bh \u2013R e,sph,eq diagram for ETGs Fig. 8 ).\nBroadly speaking, some bulges may have arisen from a kind of apid monolithic collapse, or at least result from an early-formation rocess that created the observed high- z \u2018red nuggets\u2019, while most lliptical galaxies likely formed from a binary merger or hierarchical erging (in the case of the BCGs) o v er the age of the Universe. s such, a meaningful cosmological probe into the evolution of the alaxy/black hole scaling relations needs to be mindful of the galaxy orphology. F or e xample, a sample of elliptical galaxies at z = 1 an not be directly compared with a sample of bulges at z = 0; to do o would be comparing apples and oranges.\nTo summarise, the notion of a single near-linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relaion is inadequate and seems to offer misdirection in understanding alaxies and black holes. The averaging of black hole and galaxy asses through mergers has established neither the expected nor an bserved near-linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation. While we have presented he most accurate M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram to date, and interpreted the road brush stroke near\u2013parallel relations shown in Sahu et al. 2019a ), there is further information to be gleaned from this diagram.\nergers, both wet and dry, which do not fold in all of the disc\u2019s stellar ass will be addressed in Graham & Sahu ( 2022 ), where we develop omething of a phylogenetic tree diagram within the bi v ariate space f M bh versus M \u2217,sph . One should expect to observe morphology-dependent substructure n other black hole scaling diagrams. F or e xample, as previously oted, the broad red/blue sequence for ETGs/LTGs in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal iagram has been observed in the M bh \u2013colour diagram (Dullo et al. 020 ). This broad division may also appear in the M bh \u2013metallicity, Z , iagram (Warner, Hamann & Dietrich 2003 ; Kisaka, Kojima & Otani 008 ). Depending how the number of globular clusters, N GC , traces galaxy\u2019s stellar mass (Mieske, K \u0308upper & Brockamp 2014 , and eferences therein), one may also expect the ETGs and LTGs to follow ifferent trends in the M bh \u2013N GC diagram (Spitler & Forbes 2009 ; urkert & Tremaine 2010 ). The number of red and blue globular lusters around each galaxy may yield yet further subdivisions (see undu & Whitmore 1998 ; Kuntschner et al. 2002 ), as may their inematics (e.g. Sadoun & Colin 2012 ; Pota et al. 2013 ).\nNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\n9 \u2018Barge\u2019 is an amalgamation of Bar + Bulge.\n3\nt 3\nt\nWith our new understanding of the relevance of galaxy morpholgy and galaxy formation history, the role of mergers, and refined nsight into what may be considered the primary relations versus heir modified/evolved form, one is also better placed to tackle he question of whether or not a two-dimensional plane within a hree-dimensional space may provide an improved description over i v ariate linear relations. For example, does a third axis, in addition o M bh and M sph , unco v er a distribution on a more Fundamental lane? Our analysis, considering additional parameters obtained rom physically moti v ated multicomponent decomposition, such as he spheroid S \u0301ersic index and stellar density (e.g. Graham & Driver 007b ; Saglia et al. 2016 ; Sahu et al. 2022a ), along with spheroid size, ass, and velocity dispersion, will be presented in a forthcoming aper. Here, we restrict ourselves to briefly explaining why the ombination of M bh , M \u2217,sph , and R e,sph,eq (or equally 30 \u3008 I \u3009 e ) may ot produce a useful plane about which the scatter in the log ( M bh ) irection is less than that seen about the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation. For the following thought experiment, we can consider two parallel elations in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram, one for S0 galaxy bulges and the ther for an offset population of merger -b uilt E galaxies. We can use he knowledge that the (logarithm of the) half-light spheroid radius cales with the (logarithm of the) spheroid stellar mass (Fig. 7 ). One ay to think of the problem is that we wish to introduce an R e,sph,eq erm to ef fecti vely shift the E galaxies to the left in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph iagram, to make them o v erlap with the bulges and thereby reduce he scatter seen in this diagram (see Fig. 8 ). Ho we ver, we need to ear in mind that this procedure will also shift the bulges to the left, iven that we are assuming no knowledge of morphology and just sing the parameters M bh , M \u2217,sph , and R e,sph,eq . It turns out that to chiev e o v erlap of the elliptical and bulge samples, the necessary ubtraction of a log R e term from the log M \u2217, sph values in the M bh \u2013 \u2217,sph diagram results in a near-vertical distribution of points with\nnear-infinite slope. Remember, R e,sph,eq scales almost linearly with \u2217,sph . This shall be shown in a forthcoming paper but we felt it was f sufficient interest to provide some initial insight here.\n.4 Is there a role for AGN feedback in shaping the turno v er nd high-mass end of the galaxy mass function?\nhe observational results herein represent a considerable departure rom the connection galaxies are often claimed or thought to have ith their central black hole.

Graham ( 2012 ) and Graham & Scott 2013 ) highlighted this steeper slope and discussed how dry mergers ight be producing an offshoot of core-S \u0301ersic galaxies, creating what was thought to be) a near-linear slope at high black hole masses n the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram. Ho we ver, this idea did not account for he incoming disc mass during some mergers, or for the more recent bservation that merger -b uilt elliptical galaxies (with and without\n1 We use the term \u2018superlinear\u2019 to denote a power-law with a slope steeper han 1 but not as high as 2. 2 We use the term \u2018near-quadratic\u2019 to describe a power law with a slope close o a value of 2.\nFigure 10. Schematic of the galaxy stellar-mass function. Here, we speculate, with reasoning in Section 4.4 , as to the nature of the galaxy stellar-mass function. While AGN feedback might regulate bulge growth and help to establish the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation in some disc galaxies, it may be the hot gas halo which curtails star formation in discs and keeps it truncated in elliptical galaxies. Mergers, rather than AGN feedback, appear to have established the elliptical galaxy M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation (Figs 8 and 9 ).\nd O M o n t c t M\nm f i ( G d 2 a l o f g e\ns s w i ( W s m h s c t t\nf t\nr a i t f h f A 2 t m 2 a o b e r N a g f c T 2 o e\nc g t ( o a d w \u2018 \u2018 p t W g m\n4\nI h s s h e H M h e\n33 This is a play on words combining Bunsen burner \u2013 used for heating and sterilisation \u2013 and a reference to the idea sparked by (Benson et al. 2003 ).\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2177/6847192 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nepleted cores) do not follow a near-linear M bh \u2013 M \u2217,sph relation. bviously, AGN feedback has thus also not produced a near-linear bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation for the elliptical galaxies. Moreo v er, the location f the elliptical galaxies in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram would appear to ot be due to AGN feedback but rather major mergers in which he angular momenta of the progenitor galaxy\u2019s discs have largely ancelled. This observation is apparent from the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram, he M bh / M \u2217,sph ratios (Fig. 3 ), the M bh / M \u2217,gal ratios (Fig. 6 ), and the bh \u2013R e,sph diagram (Fig. 8 ). While \u2018quasar mode\u2019 AGN feedback (discussed in Section 4.5 ) ight contribute to a link between black hole mass and bulge mass or some lower mass systems, it is not yet well established how much t may regulate the gas and star formation in the discs of galaxies e.g. Gabor & Bournaud 2014 ; Davis, Graham & Cameron 2018 ). iven that most of the stellar mass in disc galaxies resides in their iscs, with B / T < 0.5 for most S0 and S galaxies (Graham & Worley 008 ), the role of AGN in shaping the galaxy stellar-mass function ppears limited. Given that mergers, rather than AGN feedback, have ikely built the elliptical galaxies which dominate the high-mass end f the galaxy mass function (e.g. Driver et al. 2022 ), the scope or AGN feedback driving and shaping coevolution in high-mass alaxies appears quenched (e.g. Benson et al. 2003 ; Ragone-Figueroa t al. 2013 ; C \u00b8 atmabacak et al. 2022 ). Of course, a galaxy does not need to blow out its gas \u2013 via, ay, supernovae or an AGN \u2013 in order to cause a cessation of tar formation. A galaxy could instead prevent the cooling of gas hich might form stars (Benson et al. 2003 ). Creating a hot gas halo n/around massive pressure-supported spheroids may have this effect e.g. Mart \u0301\u0131n-Navarro, Burchett & Mezcua 2020 , see our Fig. 10 ).\nhile star formation and stellar winds might not generate the escape peeds required to clear gas from a massive galaxy (and its dark atter halo), they contribute a hot gas source, as does gas \u2018shockeating\u2019 during a galaxy collision (e.g. Joshi et al. 2019 ). X-ray puttering from hot gas (Galliano et al. 2021 ) also breaks up dust louds and thereby remo v es the shielding from ionising radiation hat dust may hav e pro vided potential stellar nurseries. Furthermore, hese winds can keep the AGN \u2018pilot light\u2019 on by supplying lo w-le vel\nuelling (e.g. Ciotti et al. 1991 ; Soria et al. 2006 ) for the AGN. We erm such an energy source a \u2018Benson burner\u2019. 33\nShould hot gas haloes efficiently suppress star formation, then ather than ejecting gas which might form stars, it is about acquiring nd retaining (hot) gas. The system needs to be capable of maintainng, and thus also massive enough to retain, a hot gas halo rather han have it e v aporate or collapse into a disk where it may cool and orm stars. A hot \u2019n dry (hot gas and dry merger) combination may elp explain the upper end of the galaxy mass function where star ormation has dwindled or ceased. Unlike energetic but directional GN jets (which can both suppress and trigger star formation: Silk 013 ; Gaibler 2014 ; Cresci et al. 2015 ), a hot gas halo can permeate he entire galaxy, including the disc. The relation between black hole\nass and both X-ray gas temperature and luminosity (Bogd \u0301an et al. 018 ; Gaspari et al. 2019 ; Lakhchaura, Truong & Werner 2019 ) may dd credibility to this picture. Low levels of omni-directional particle utflows and electromagnetic radiation from the central \u2018Benson urner\u2019 would also help counter cooling (Best et al. 2006 ; Bower t al. 2006 ; Croton et al. 2006 ; Bower et al. 2017 ) \u2013 seen as X-ray adiation coming from the hot gas halo (e.g. Shapiro & Moore 1976 ; ulsen, Stewart & Fabian 1984 ). This would help hold star formation t bay, at least in a closed-box model with no substantial infall of cold as (e.g. Dekel et al. 2009 ). When cooler gas is available, sporadic eeding and associated percolation events may produce bubbles and avities observed at various wavelengths (Sofue & Handa 1984 ; suboi et al. 1985 ; Bland-Hawthorn & Cohen 2003 ; B \u0302 \u0131rzan et al. 004 ). Ho we ver, this so-called \u2018radio mode\u2019 AGN feedback would nly maintain the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation, which we have argued is stablished by other means (Dubois et al. 2016 ; Werner et al. 2019 ).\nFor the first time, we have used the black hole scaling relations to onfirm that AGN primarily have a caretaker role among elliptical alaxies, and we have re vealed ho w mergers rule the roost and dictate he M bh / M \u2217,sph ratio and presumably also the M \u2217,sph / M darkmatter ratio Dubois et al. 2016 ; Marasco et al. 2021 ). This result is tied to the ffset trend seen for elliptical galaxies in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph , M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal , nd M bh \u2013R e,sph diagrams. It is not due to spheroids with partially epleted cores, which some E galaxies ha ve b ut others do not, and hich some S0 galaxy bulges possess. Such spheroids, whose central phase space\u2019 is depleted of stars, tend to occupy the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph red sequence\u2019, which is a \u2018red herring\u2019 due to the partial picture it rovided. In particular, it missed the wet and damp mergers, and thus he steep M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation for the ensemble of elliptical galaxies.\ne will pursue this further by addressing merger -b uilt lenticular alaxies with depleted cores, such as NGC 5813, and major wet ergers, for example NGC 5128, in Graham & Sahu ( 2022 ).\n.5 Some further thoughts\nt is evident that the coevolution of bulges and their central black holes ave not produced a simple near-linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation. The teep M bh \u2212M \u2217,sph relation for bulges has implications for countless imulations, semi-analytic works, theories, and papers that may ave calibrated themselves to a near-linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation. For xample, as shown by Bogd \u0301an et al. ( 2018 , their fig. 6), while the orizon-AGN simulation (Dubois et al. 2014 ) produces an M bh \u2013 \u2217,sph \u2018red sequence\u2019 with a slope around 1.1 to 1.2, it does not ave the scatter to accommodate the steeper relations defined by ither the bulges or the elliptical galaxies. That is, it appears to have\nMNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\nM\nn g r 2 e 2 t i S t i M\ns c g C b w ( m\n\u03b4\nT r t i g \u2018 2 u a f r d\ng r B a e F c a b i t ( t T i a i o m T h I T o\nw ( O a a r a g 2\nc G M M c t f e D M w c\nD t s T w s r r s t b t m 2\nd A B m A\ni M g b m L n\nA\nT f within the Australian Research Council\u2019s Centre of Excellence for\n34 https:// tde.space/\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2177/6847192 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\not captured the key-merger-induced jump from bulges to elliptical alaxies. While some studies are ahead of the pack, producing steeper elations (e.g. Fontanot et al. 2006 ; Dubois et al. 2012 ; Khandai et al. 012 ; Angl \u0301es-Alc \u0301azar et al. 2017 ; Weinberger et al. 2018 ; Delvecchio t al. 2019 ; Marshall et al. 2020 ; Irodotou et al. 2022 ; Tillman et al. 022 ), it has been hard for the notion of a steep M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation o get oxygen given the significant paradigm shift that it implies. It s therefore perhaps worth reiterating an element from Graham & cott ( 2013 , their section 4.3), which introduced a related revision o the \u2018quasar mode\u2019 (aka cold-gas mode) of black hole growth used n some semi-analytic models (Granato et al. 2004 ; Springel, Di\natteo & Hernquist 2005 ). The steep M bh \u2013M dyn,sph relation detected by Graham ( 2012 ), which upplanted the single linear relation from H \u0308aring & Rix ( 2004 ), hallenged the past assumption of accretion-induced black hole rowth that is linearly proportional to the inflowing mass of cold gas. roton et al. ( 2006 , their equation 8) and others have popularised this lack hole feeding scenario to model how AGN outflows account for hat was thought to be a linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation. Graham & Scott 2013 ) presented a revised prescription for the increase in black hole ass, \u03b4M bh , associated with wet mergers, such that M bh \u221d ( M min\nM maj\n)[ M X cold\n1 + (280 km s \u22121 ) /V virial\n] . (6)\nhe exponent X represents the logarithmic slope of the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph elation for bulges, and they specified X = 2. M min and M maj are the otal baryonic masses from the minor and major galaxies involved n the accretion/merger event, and M cold is their combined cold as mass. The velocity V virial is the merged system\u2019s circular or virial\u2019 velocity, normalised at 280 km s \u22121 (Kauffmann & Haehnelt 000 ). This modified equation may pro v e helpful for exploring and nderstanding galaxy/(black hole) evolution through semi-analytic pproaches, although it does not encompass the cessation of star ormation due to hot X-ray haloes in massive systems, or the pivotal ole of dry mergers in shaping the distribution seen in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph iagram. There are also significant ramifications for predictions of ra vitational wa ves from space-based interferometers (e.g. Meritt & Milosavljevi \u0301c 2005 ; Sesana 2013 ; Khan, Mirza & Holleyockelmann 2020 ; Santoliquido et al. 2022 ) and pulsar timing rrays monitored with ground-based radio telescopes (e.g. Hobbs t al. 2010 ; Shannon et al. 2013 ; Chen, Sesana & Conselice 2019 ). or e xample, the steep M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation for bulges should be onsidered, if not fa v oured o v er the near-linear \u2018red-sequence\u2019 when ssigning BH masses to galaxies in works attempting to estimate the ackground signal from binary black hole mergers. One caveat here s that the mergers involving a BCG may involve systems on both he bulge and the elliptical sequence. As noted in Graham & Soria 2019 ), predictions for black hole masses will be too high if using he original near-linear M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation at low spheroid masses. his o v erprediction can result in o v erlooking potential populations of ntermediate-mass black holes (10 2 < M bh / M < 10 5 ). Furthermore, pplication of the steeper relation has already been shown to result n an order of magnitude reduction to the expected detection rate f extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) events from compact stellarass objects around massive black holes (e.g. Mapelli et al. 2012 ). hat work can be further refined based on the updated relations erein, providing better expectations for what the European Laser nterferometer Space Antenna ( LISA ) (Danzmann & LISA Study eam 1997 ) and TianQin (Luo et al. 2016 ) can hope to achieve based n their current design plans.\nNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\nAs noted abo v e, the pursuit of long-wav elength gravitational aves, from the coalescence of binary supermassive black holes e.g. Komossa et al. 2003 ; Rodriguez et al. 2006 ; Liu et al. 2019 ; \u2019Neill et al. 2022 ), is an endea v our underway via monitoring pulsar rri v al times using radio telescopes. These studies will benefit from n impro v ed knowledge of the varying M bh / M \u2217,sph and M bh / M \u2217,gal atios in pre-merged galaxies. This can enable revised predictions for, nd possibly aid in the tentative confirmation of, a long-wavelength ra vitational wa ve background (Arzoumanian et al. 2020 ; Chen et al. 021 ). Related to the EMRI events are the nuclear stars clusters that oexist with (e.g. Gonz \u0301alez Delgado et al. 2008 ; Seth et al. 2008 ; raham & Spitler 2009 ) and feed (e.g. Komossa 2002 ; Li, Narayan & enou 2002 ) the central black hole in galaxies. The revised/steeper bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relations, coupled with the M nsc \u2013M \u2217,sph relations (Balells et al. 2003 ; Graham & Guzm \u0301an 2003 ), led to the disco v ery of he M bh \u2013M nsc relation (Graham 2016a , 2020 ). This should be useful or modelling not only gravitational radiation events but also the xpected frequenc y of tidal disruption ev ents (TDEs: Komossa & ahlem 2001 ; Wang & Merritt 2004 ; Komossa 2015 ; Stone & etzger 2016 ; Coughlin et al. 2017 ; Toscani, Rossi & Lodato 2020 ), hich have been observed in data dating back to 1990. There are urrently around 100 such known events. 34\nIf a non-rotating Schw arzschild\u2013Droste (Schw arzschild 1916 ; roste 1917 ) black hole is more massive than \u223c10 8 M , and thus he gravitational gradient at, and be yond, the \u2018ev ent horizon\u2019 is not trong enough to pull a star apart, there will be no TDE (Magorrian & remaine 1999 ). The star will cross the event horizon and disappear ithout displaying its hot interior. As we have seen, most of the ystems with M bh 10 8 M follow the near-quadratic M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph elation for bulges, suggesting the need to use this steeper relation ather than the near-linear \u2018red-sequence\u2019, which pertains to (some) ystems with M bh 10 8 M . One should, ho we ver, be mindful that he spin-reduced size of the event horizon in a rotating Kerr ( 1963 ) lack hole can result in a star\u2019s tidal disruption radius being greater han the event horizon for black hole masses up \u223c7 \u00d7 10 8 M for\naximally spinning black holes (Beloborodov et al. 1992 ; Kesden 012 ). The morphology-dependent black hole scaling relations also emand a re-examination of the virial f -factors used to convert GN virial masses into black hole masses (e.g. Bentz et al. 2009 ; entz & Manne-Nicholas 2018 ). Failing to account for the different orphologies and formation history of the spheroids hosting the GN or inactive black holes will produce erroneous results. As noted in Graham ( 2012 ), there is a wealth of additional and mmediate implications and insight from the steeper-than-linear M bh \u2013 \u2217,sph relations. These include black hole mass predictions in other alaxies, constructing the black hole mass function, and deriving the lack hole mass density based on reliable bulge and elliptical galaxy ass functions. In passing, it is noted that some care with the Hubble\u2013 ema \u0302 \u0131tre constant, or little h , is required for such calculations, as oted in Graham & Driver ( 2007a ) and Croton ( 2013 ).\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhis research was supported under the Australian Research Council\u2019s unding scheme DP17012923.

Therefore, n this section, we repeat our analysis using the latest (opticalnfrared colour)-dependent M \u2217/ L ratios. The outcome is that our ain conclusion stands, reflective of the small variation in the value f M \u2217/ L at 3.6 \u03bcm. 1 An (optical-NIR colour)-dependent \u03d2\u2217 he baseline model in Schombert et al. ( 2019 , their table 2) is such hat log ( M \u2217/L obs, 3 . 6 ) = 0 . 933( m V , Vega \u2212 m 3 . 6 , Vega ) 2 \u2212 4 . 932( m V , Vega \u2212 m 3 . 6 , Vega ) + 6 . 123 , alid for 2.3 ( m V , Vega \u2212 m 3.6, Vega ) 3.1. This equation is based n the Kroupa ( 2001 ) IMF, referred to as the pseudo-Kroupa IMF by ernardi et al. ( 2010 ). To adjust to the Kroupa ( 2002 ) IMF, one needs o subtract 0.1 dex. To use the abo v e equation, both the V band and he 3.6 \u03bcm magnitudes need to be calibrated on the Vega magnitude ystem. Given that our Spitzer 3.6 \u03bcm magnitudes are calibrated on he AB system, and the RC3 V -band data are on the Vega system, we ollow Willmer ( 2018 ) 36 and use Vega = m AB \u2212 2 . 76 mag t 3.6 \u03bcm to modify the equation such that it can use 3.6 \u03bcm (AB) nd V (Vega) magnitudes. We also subtract 0.1 dex to bring it in line ith the Kroupa ( 2002 ) IMF. Doing so, we have that log ( M \u2217/L obs, 3 . 6 ) = 0 . 933( m V , Vega \u2212 m 3 . 6 , AB + 2 . 76) 2 \u2212 4 . 932( m V , Vega \u2212 m 3 . 6 , AB + 2 . 76) + 6 . 023 .

(A2)\ne assign a 15 per cent uncertainty to these, reflecting the 0.05 ex uncertainty in log M \u2217 noted by Schombert et al. ( 2022 ) and llowing for a reasonable error in the assigned colour. This relation equation A2 ), along with equation ( A1 ), is shown in the right-hand anel of Fig. A1 . One can see that they are similar over their colour ange of applicability.\nComparing Fig. A1 with Fig. 1 , it is apparent that there are some ifferences. For instances, while the ETGs typically have red colours nd 0.6 M \u2217/ L 3.6 0.9 in Fig. 1 , they follow a colour\u2013magnitude elation in Fig. A1 and have 0.6 M \u2217/ L 3.6 0.9. The LTGs in ig. A1 appear to define a blue cloud, with 0.4 M \u2217/ L 3.6 0.7, while heir cloud-like distribution appears consistent with the ETG colour\u2013 agnitude relation in Fig. A1 , where they have 0.45 M \u2217/ L 3.6 .75. A few of our galaxies can also be seen to stand out in the olour\u2013magnitude diagram shown in the left-hand and middle panels f Fig. A1 . The ETG with the faintest spheroid magnitude is GC 2787, remodelled in Graham & Sahu ( 2022 ). Circinus was lready discussed in Section 2.1 . The Seyfert galaxy NGC 3079 s a particularly dusty and rather edge-on (80 \u25e6) spiral galaxy. It is otable for having blown a rather large bubble (Cecil et al. 2001 ) rom its central region, somewhat akin to the Fermi Bubble in the\nilky Way (Sofue & Handa 1984 ; Su, Slatyer & Finkbeiner 2010 ). e Vaucouleurs et al.

Comparison of the spheroid and galaxy stellar masses derived using the optical-colour-dependent \u03d2\u2217 ratios from IP13, as given by our equation ( 4 ), and using the (optical-infrared colour)-dependent \u03d2\u2217 ratios from Schombert et al. ( 2022 ), as given by our equation ( A2 ). The differences seen here will result in different black hole scaling relations to those in the main text (Table 2 ).\nFigure A3. Similar to Fig. 2 , but using equation ( A2 ) to derive the spheroid stellar masses. This yields black hole scaling relations with similar relative offsets to those seen in Sahu et al.

Here, the middle panel appears to be the optimal separation of morphological types. The bulges of spiral galaxies and lenticular galaxies appear to converge at high masses.\nt g t t s s a T (\na ( S = i\nS g f ( 0 M a E 0\nt w d e\nu d F u I t t i t m a\nA\nI t t o M\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2177/6847192 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024 he observed B - and V -band magnitudes of NGC 3079.

Had he V -band magnitude been 0.5 mag brighter, this galaxy would not tand out in Fig. A1 and its mass-to-light ratio would be 10 per cent maller. It does not stand out in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram. NGC 821 lso appears as something of an outlier; it is too blue by \u223c0.7 mag. his may be due to contamination from the o v erlapping V \u22489.3 mag Vega) star SIMBAD BD + 10 293. For eight galaxies without a reliable V -band magnitude, we used bisector regression on the available ( V \u2212[3.6])\u2013M sph , 3 . 6 data Fig. A1 ) to obtain a V \u2212[3.6] colour based on their M sph , 3 . 6 values. pecifically, we derived and used the expression V \u2212[3.6] (Vega) 1.45 \u2212 0.09 M sph , 3 . 6 (AB). These colours are marked with brackets n Table 1 . In passing, we note that, based on the pseudo-Kroupa IMF,\nchombert et al. ( 2022 ) suggest M \u2217/ L obs, 3.6 \u2248 1 to 1.05 for elliptical alaxies, \u22480.97 for red bulges, which are likely in ETGs, and \u22480.86 or blue bulges, likely in the later spiral galaxy types. For the Kroupa 2002 ) IMF, this equates to 0.79 to 0.83 (E), 0.77 (red bulges), and .68 (blue bulges). Such a step function differs from the continuous \u2217/ L ratios for the galaxy models, while qualitatively mimics the pproach in Sahu et al. ( 2019a ), which used M \u2217/ L obs, 3.6 = 0.6 for TGs and 0.453 for LTGs, based on the Chabrier ( 2003 ) IMF, or .53 and 0.40 for the Kroupa ( 2002 ) IMF . W e are, ho we ver, keen\ne\no a v oid (or only use) a prescription to convert light into mass ith such a discontinuity, given that we are checking for potential iscontinuity or offsets in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram. We proceed using quation ( A2 ).\nFig. A2 compares the spheroid and galaxy stellar masses obtained sing equations ( 4 ) and ( A2 ). Here, one can better visualise the ifferences between the distribution of mass-to-light ratios seen in igs 1 and A1 . Apparently, for the full ensemble of galaxy types sed in our study, the two prescriptions we have used for \u03d2\u2217 \u2013 from nto & Portinari ( 2013 ) and Schombert et al. ( 2022 ) after conversion o the same IMF \u2013 yield consistent results. Ho we ver, taking things to he next level by looking at dependencies on the galaxy morphology, t is also apparent that further information can be gleaned. Given he slight differences in slope and zero-point (at some mass) for each\norphological type (E, ES/S0, and S), we have repeated the diagrams nd analysis previously based on equation ( 4 ).\n2 Results\nt is apparent from Fig. A3 that, qualitatively, the large offset between he ES/S0 and E galaxies in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram remains. That is, his is a robust result. The steeper M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph relation for the bulges f spiral galaxies is in agreement with that observed when using \u2217/ L \u2217, 3.6, obs = 0.453 for every spiral galaxy with Spitzer data (Davis t al. 2019 ). This may seem counterintuitive until it is remembered\nMNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\nM\nFigure A4.

The results uggest that the evolution of bulges in relatively gas-poor versus as-rich discs may proceed along different paths, converging at high ulge masses (Fig. A3 , middle panel). Perhaps stellar feedback has imited the black hole accretion in the spiral galaxies, explaining heir lower M bh / M \u2217,sph ratios than in many similarly massed bulges f ES/S0 galaxies. Alternatively, perhaps the black holes in the piral galaxies are yet to grow up by exhausting their fuel supply nd largely drying out, as has occurred in many of the ES/S0 alaxies. Using equation ( A2 ), the M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal relations have also been e-derived for the E, ES/S0, and S galaxies (Fig. A5 ), as has the ssociated ( M bh / M \u2217,gal )\u2013M \u2217,gal diagram (Fig. A6 ). Table A1 provides he mass scaling relations based on equation ( A2 ). Of note is the \u223c0.3 ex, nearly 2 \u03c3 , change to the intercept of the M bh \u2013M \u2217,gal relation or the spiral galaxies. This translates to predictions for black hole asses in spiral galaxies that are a factor of \u223c2 different to what ne obtains when using the scaling relations in the main text. This ighlights the need to pay attention to the \u03c5 term in these equations. The spheroid size\u2013mass diagram has been reproduced in Fig. A7 sing the stellar mass-to-light ratios obtained via equation ( A2 ). t continues to reveal an apparent continuity between bulges and lliptical galaxies that supports the merger -b uilt ev olutionary process shown in Figs A4 and A6 ) for explaining the demographics of assive ETGs in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram.\nNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\nBuilding on Fig. 9 , Fig. A8 shows additional pathways for the ulges of spiral galaxies.

Regarding the three thin arrows in the lower part of the diagram: if the gaseous evolution of spiral galaxies predominantly grows the disc and AGN but not the bulge, then it will evolve upwards in this diagram rather than along the spiral galaxy sequence.

This includes the deri v ation of ulge, rather than galaxy, colours. These may come from the decomosition of optical images or sampling regions of the bulge largely naffected by dust (e.g. Balcells & Peletier 1994 ). Furthermore, with ntegral field units (IFUs), one can pursue star formation histories and ates, extinction, metallicity, and ages (e.g. Garc \u0301\u0131a-Benito et al. 2019 , nd references therein) on a spax el-by-spax el basis. Of course, some ind of bulge/disc separation will still be desirable for many spaxels, ust as it is when dealing with a global galaxy colour. None the ess, these measurements should enable refined stellar M \u2217/ L ratios or the bulges, which will help to better establish the LTG bulge equence in the M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph diagram. Understanding the potential ffset between the bulges of LTGs and the bulges of ETGs offers the romise of yet further insight into the intriguing lives of galaxies and heir black holes. Colour and metallicity gradients (e.g. Spolaor et al. 009 ) may also offer clues to how some systems formed, whether hrough wet or dry mergers or relics from an early-Universe. Here, e have implicitly focused on dry mergers in which the bulk of he orbital angular momentum (both in the progenitors and between hem) cancels and an E galaxy is generated. We will explore mergeruilt systems that have retained substantial angular momentum in raham & Sahu ( 2022 ). 3 Some notes on little \u03c5 ere, we discuss the mass-to-light conversion term, \u03c5, introduced in avis et al. ( 2019 ), and further developed in Sahu et al. ( 2019a ), to ccount for switches between various prescriptions of \u03d2\u2217 (e.g. Bell t al. 2003 ; Zibetti, Charlot & Rix 2009 ; Taylor et al. 2011 ; Into & ortinari 2013 ; Roediger & Courteau 2015 ; Schombert et al. 2022 ). 37 uch conversions are necessary if one uses any M bh \u2013M \u2217,sph and/or bh \u2013M \u2217,gal scaling relations when an alternative \u03d2\u2217 prescription to hat used to establish these relations is used to obtain the stellar mass f the target for which one wishes to predict the black hole mass. hile this should sound obvious, it can be problematic in practice nd Sahu et al.

( 2019 , heir equation 10), through the introduction of the \u03c5 term in the elation log ( M bh ) = A log ( M \u2217/\u03c5) + B. Davis et al. ( 2019 ) used \u2217/ L obs, 3.6 = 0.453 for a sample of spiral galaxies imaged with he Spitzer Space Telescope \u2019s Infrared Array Camera - channel 1 IRAC-1: Fazio et al. 2004 ), which operated at a central wavelength f 3.6 \u03bcm. As such, \u03c5 was initially introduced as \u03c5 IRAC1, 0.453 = IRAC1 /0.453, with \u03d2IRAC1 a (potentially) different stellar mass-toight ratio used by someone else to obtain the stellar masses of their pheroid and/or galaxy sample. Sahu et al. ( 2019a , their fig. 4 and heir equations 6 \u20138 for \u03c5) developed this further by providing a imited set of conversions for when the user of the scaling relation as obtained their stellar mass in a non-IRAC1 band and thus does ot simply have an alternate \u03d2IRAC1 value. There are multiple approaches to deriving \u03c5, and we present two f them here, using the \u03d2\u2217 prescriptions given in this paper as an xample.\nFrom its definition, we have that\n\u2261 \u03d2 2 /\u03d2 1 , (A3)\nor use in an expression like log ( M bh / M ) = A 1 log [ M \u2217, sph , 1 /\u03c5(5 \u00d7 10 10 M )\n]+ B 1 (A4) n which \u03d21 was used to define M \u2217,sph, 1 . Now, if, for example, one ses equation ( A2 ) to derive the stellar mass of a spheroid, but wishes o use the equations from Table 2 , then one can calculate the required\nterm by dividing the \u03d22 ratio from equation ( A2 ) by that given in quation ( 4 ), to give\n= 0 . 39 + 0 . 48( m V , Vega \u2212 m 3 . 6 , AB ) 10 1 . 034( m B, Vega \u2212m V , Vega ) \u22121 . 067 , (A5)\nNRAS 518, 2177\u20132200 (2023)\nor \u22120.06 < ( m V , Vega \u2212 m 3.6, AB ) < 0.94 and m B , Vega \u2212 m V , Vega > .5. This is fine if one has both of these colour terms, with the two agnitudes required for each colour being measured consistently, for xample, within the same aperture. Ho we ver, this information may ot be available, in which case an alternative method is required. A second approach uses the scaling relation obtained by comparing he masses, M 1 and M 2 , of other spheroids obtained using each of the \u2217/ L ratios. An example of this is seen in Fig. A2 . For the relation\nlog [ M 2 / (5 \u00d7 10 10 M )] = a log [ M 1 / (5 \u00d7 10 10 M )] + b, (A6) t can be shown that log \u03c5 = (\na \u2212 1 a\n) log [ M 2 / (5 \u00d7 10 10 M )] + b/a. (A7)\nhus, knowing a and b provides an alternative means to calculate the alue of \u03c5 for your value of M 2 obtained using \u03d22 .\nThe slightly different trends in Fig. A2 resulted in the somewhat ifferent black hole scaling relations between Table 2 and Table A1 . ith a little algebra, it can also be shown that\n= 2 A 1 A 1 + A 2 and b = B 1 \u2212 B 2 A 1 + A 2 , (A8)\nhere A 1 and B 1 are the slope and intercept from the black hole caling relation (Table 2 ) derived using the \u03d21 ratios (equation 4 ) nd A 2 and B 2 are the slope and intercept from the black hole scaling elation (Table A1 ) derived using the \u03d22 ratios (equation A2 ). For ur spiral galaxies, for e xample, we hav e from equation ( A8 ) that = 0.96 and b = 0.02, while for our ES/S0 galaxies, we have = 1.01 and b = \u22120.03. Such morphology-specific terms for the \u03c5 quation (equation A7 ) provide an additional level of sophistication o that presented in Sahu et al. ( 2019a ).\nhis paper has been typeset from a T E X/L A T E X file prepared by the author.\nan Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024"
