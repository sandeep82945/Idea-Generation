    "abstractText": "A variety of different synthesis methods for the fabrication of solar cell absorbers based on the lead halide perovskite methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3, MAPI) have been successfully developed in the past. In this work, we elaborate upon vacuum\u2010based dual source co\u2010evaporation as an industrially attractive processing technology. We present non\u2010stationary processing schemes and concentrate on details of co\u2010evaporation schemes where we intentionally delay the start/end points of one of the two evaporated components (MAI and PbI2). Previously, it was found for solar cells based on a regular n\u2010i\u2010p structure, that the pre\u2010evaporation of PbI 2 is highly beneficial for absorber growth and solar cell performance. Here, we apply similar non\u2010stationary processing schemes with pre/post\u2010 deposition sequences for the growth of MAPI absorbers in an inverted p\u2010i\u2010n solar cell architecture. Solar cell parameters as well as details of the absorber growth are compared for a set of different evaporation schemes. Contrary to our preliminary assumptions, we find the pre\u2010evaporation of PbI2 to be detrimental in the inverted configuration, indicating that the beneficial effect of the seed layers originates from interface properties related to improved charge carrier transport and extraction across this interface rather than being related to an improved absorber growth. This is further evidenced by a performance improvement of inverted solar cell devices with pre\u2010evaporated MAI and post\u2010deposited PbI2 layers. Finally, we provide two hypothetical electronic models that might cause the observed effects.",

Heinze 1*, Sebastian Berwig1, Jie Ge1, Roland Scheer1 & Paul Pistor 1,2*\nA variety of different synthesis methods for the fabrication of solar cell absorbers based on the lead halide perovskite methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3, MAPI) have been successfully developed in the past. In this work, we elaborate upon vacuum\u2011based dual source co\u2011evaporation as an industrially attractive processing technology. We present non\u2011stationary processing schemes and concentrate on details of co\u2011evaporation schemes where we intentionally delay the start/end points of one of the two evaporated components (MAI and PbI2). Previously, it was found for solar cells based on a regular n\u2011i\u2011p structure, that the pre\u2011evaporation of PbI\n2 is highly beneficial for absorber growth and\nsolar cell performance. Here, we apply similar non\u2011stationary processing schemes with pre/post\u2011 deposition sequences for the growth of MAPI absorbers in an inverted p\u2011i\u2011n solar cell architecture. Solar cell parameters as well as details of the absorber growth are compared for a set of different evaporation schemes. Contrary to our preliminary assumptions, we find the pre\u2011evaporation of PbI2 to be detrimental in the inverted configuration, indicating that the beneficial effect of the seed layers originates from interface properties related to improved charge carrier transport and extraction across this interface rather than being related to an improved absorber growth. This is further evidenced by a performance improvement of inverted solar cell devices with pre\u2011evaporated MAI and post\u2011deposited PbI2 layers. Finally, we provide two hypothetical electronic models that might cause the observed effects.\nLead halide perovskite semiconductors have excelled in recent years as versatile semiconductors in a variety of opto-electronic applications1,2. Most prominently, laboratory scale solar cells, both in single junction (\u03b7\u00a0>\u00a025 %) and tandem configuration with Si (\u03b7\u00a0>\u00a029.5%), have shown rapidly increasing record efficiencies well beyond expectations3.\nApart from device stability, main concerns in view of an industrial uptake of the technology are the scalability and reproducibility of the implemented fabrication processes. While many technological advances on small, laboratory scale solar cells have been obtained with wet-chemical methods (e.g. spin-coating, printing), some vacuum-based approaches have also been successfully implemented.\nLiu et\u00a0al. reported the fabrication of efficient, planar perovskite solar cells by dual source co-evaporation, using methylammonium (MA) and PbCl2 as precursors reaching efficiencies above 15%4. Several other groups have followed this route (with either PbI2 or PbCl2 as lead halide precursors)5 and in 2019 the use of optimized contact layers by Bolink et\u00a0al. led to efficiencies exceeding 20%6. Co-evaporation generally leads to compact, homogeneous films, is fast and easily scalable and offers an improved processing control under reproducible conditions. The two main approaches used nowadays are based either on a) simultaneous, stationary co-evaporation from different sources or b) sequential processing, where first\u00a0only one component is deposited (normally the lead halide, e.g. PbI2 ). This precursor layer is then converted into the perovskite, e.g. through exposure to an MAI atmosphere or by deposition of the MAI followed by an annealing7,8.\nAttempts to partly combine the two approaches are rare, i.e. to move to non-stationary co-evaporation where the application of the two precursors is not completely synchronized and stationary. This is even more\nOPEN\n1Martin-Luther-University, Von-Danckelmann-Platz 3, 06120 Halle (Saale), Germany. 2Universidad Pablo de Olavide, c/ Utrera 1, 41013 Sevilla, Spain. 3Fraunhofer CSP, Otto-Ei\u00dffeldt-Stra\u00dfe 12, 06120 Halle (Saale), Germany. *email: karl.heinze@physik.uni-halle.de; ppis@upo.es; paul.pistor@physik.uni-halle.de\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:19167 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23132-w\nastonishing, as this is in fact one of the main advantages of co-evaporation in comparison to solution-based processing: the amount and ratio of precursors arriving at the substrate can be varied during processing. As an example for other photovoltaic technologies, high efficiency co-evaporated solar cells based on chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers are prepared with a complex Cu-poor/Cu-rich/Cu-poor evaporation scheme leading to optimal absorber properties and a carefully designed band gap gradient within the absorber9.\nIn this sense, non-stationary co-evaporation not only bears the potential to vary the composition of the absorber during growth, but also to initiate or terminate the growth with specific precursor compositions. Furthermore, it is rather difficult in an industrial in-line fabrication, where the substrates are normally transported across a series of linear evaporation sources, to ensure the continuously homogeneous, stationary flux of constant precursor ratios to the substrate, as is the case in a stationary laboratory setup.\nThese considerations motivated us to investigate the impact of pre-evaporating of precursors, starting the evaporation with seed layers instead of a continuous evaporation. This approach continues our previous work in this direction for solar cells in a regular n-i-p configuration10. To the best of our knowledge, this is so far the only work considering such kind of asynchronous, non-stationary co-evaporation, where we found that a preevaporation of PbI2 seed layers was greatly beneficial to the solar cell performance. We argumented, that the PbI2 seed layer initiated crystallization, increased the sticking coefficient and led to the growth of a MAPI absorber with improved properties. However, ultimately it remained unclear whether the performance improvement originated from an improved absorber growth (as a result of the different nucleation on the PbI2 seed layer) or due to an improved interface to the electron transport layer (ETL).\nIn order to elucidate this question, here, we present our first results on novel pre/post-evaporation schemes for inverted perovskite solar cells based on a p-i-n structure with NiO as hole transport layer (HTL) and an ETL double layer based on [6,6]-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and ZnO. We use different pre/postdeposition schemes of MAI and PbI2 and report their impact on absorber growth in terms of crystallization and morphology and on performance in complete solar cell devices.\nThe motivation to use an inverted solar cell configuration is two-fold: On the one hand, it allows us to directly compare the results obtained in our previous work and study the impact of pre/post-evaporation schemes for an inverted contact layer configuration (PbI2 pre-evaporation onto the HTL instead of the ETL layer). On the other hand, the use of an inverted device configuration is motivated by our longterm goal to fabricate tandem devices, where a solar cell in p-i-n configuration is needed to ensure the correct direction of the current flow in the top cell with respect to the diode of the bottom cell (p-type Si or chalcopyrite solar cell)."

            "text": "Solar cells were prepared on glass substrates coated with transparent conductive indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layers in an inverted p-i-n structure. The used stacked cell architecture is based on NiO as hole transport layer (HTL) and a bilayered electron transport layer (ETL) made of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and ZnO nanoparticles. The complete solar cell consists of a glass/ITO/NiO/MAPI/PCBM/ZnO/Ag layer stack. Details concerning the sample preparation, ETL/HTL deposition parameters, the solar cell fabrication and characterization methodology can be found in the supporting information.\nThe co-evaporation of MAPI absorbers was carried out in a high vacuum chamber (base pressure 10\u22125mbar) with two evaporation sources filled with MAI and PbI2 , respectively. The setup is described in detail in the work by Heinze et\u00a0al., where dynamic processing schemes including the pre-deposition of different seed layers were developed for regular solar cells in n-i-p structure in the same system10. Further experimental details on the evaporation setup and the characterization methodologies can be found in the supporting information.\nThe MAPI absorbers were synthesized by co-evaporating MAI and PbI2 . Optimal deposition parameters concerning the optimal flux ratios for near stoichiometric absorber compositions had been determined previously (see reference10). Following this work, we ramped both crucibles to their respective target temperature\u00a0in 900s. A constant PbI2 source temperature of 288\u25e6 C was used for all experiments. The target temperature for the temperature ramp of the MAI crucible was set to 115\u25e6 C. Due to its high vapor pressure and particle scattering, MAI does not evaporate directionally5. As a consequence, the MAI flux cannot be easily controlled by the source temperature alone, nor the installed quartz crystal microbalance. In accordance with10,11, the MAI flux was therefore controlled by adjusting the MAI source temperature in order to maintain a constant working pressure within the evaporation system. The optimal constant working pressure had been previously determined and was set to 7.5\u00d710\u22125mbar10.\nOur evaporation setup is equipped with an in\u00a0situ X-ray diffraction setup (in situ XRD). It consists of a Cu K \u03b1 X-ray source and linear detector array arranged at opposite sides of the vacuum chamber. The X-rays enter and leave the chamber through Kapton windows allowing the recording of XRD scans in an angular 2 -range of 28\u25e6 . Details on the experimental setup can be found in the supporting information and in references10,12.\nIn this work, MAPI absorbers were deposited on glass/ITO/NiO substrates in a variation of four different evaporation schemes. Every process was carried out with at least 4 samples (3 solar cells on each sample) allowing a small statistical comparison. A nitrogen filled glovebox is directly attached to our evaporation system, allowing the sample/source material insertion/extraction under inert working conditions. The four different evaporation schemes are schematically illustrated in Fig.\u00a01 and will be named throughout this work with the following abbreviations.\nThe entire evaporation time was 10100s for Eva 1-3 and 10700s for Eva 4. Pre- or post-evaporation times were set to 600s leading to total absorber thicknesses in the range of 300nm. According to our previously performed flux measurements, the layer thickness during the pre/post-evaporation sequences of 600s is in the range of 10nm to 20nm.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:19167 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23132-w\nAfter the MAPI evaporation was finished, 3 out of 4 samples were further processed to solar cells in a nitrogen atmosphere by adding a PCBM/ZnO electron transport layer (ETL). Finally, Ag contacts were evaporated in a separate vacuum chamber. j-V characteristics of the solar cells were measured under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Details on the sample preparation and contact layer deposition can be found in the supporting information. On the remaining sample, TRPL, SEM and EDX measurements were conducted in this order. For SEM analysis, the sample was cut in half allowing cross-sectional imaging."

A comparison of the remaining evaporation schemes can be found in the supporting information. The shutter control for the pre-deposition of MAI and post-deposition of PbI2 was adjusted to the heating scheme as indicated with dashed lines in the plots. Pre- and post-deposition intervals are marked by the colored rectangles (purple: MAI pre-evaporation, yellow: PbI2 post-evaporation). For the pre-deposition of MAI, the MAI deposition was started 600s earlier and accordingly, the post-deposition of PbI2 in Eva 4 was carried out by turning off the MAI heater, closing the MAI shutter and continuing with the deposition of PbI2 . The substrates were not actively heated and the substrate temperature stayed approximately constant for all evaporations starting at Tsubs = 12 \u00b0C and reaching Tsubs = 16 \u00b0C at the end of the process.\nAt the right hand side of Fig.\u00a02, the time derivative of the QCM frequency is displayed. This quantity is proportional to the rate of deposited mass modified by material constants of the quartz crystal and visualizes the deposition kinetics15. The development of the time derivative of the QCM frequency shows that some mass is already deposited before the shutters were opened, which is explained by the non-directional evaporation\nFigure\u00a01. Schematic representation of the co-evaporation schemes using PbI2 and MAI precursors on glass/ITO/NiO substrates to grow MAPI. While PbI2 evaporates as a molecular stream, MAI is distributed homogeneously in the chamber, increasing the total chamber pressure13,14. Different evaporation schemes (Evaporation 1-4) by choice of different initial/final evaporation conditions have been tested and compared with regard to their impact on the crystal growth and the electronic properties of the absorber.\nFigure\u00a02.

After the MAI shutter was opened, the slope increases, in accordance with the observed increase in chamber pressure (left). When the PbI2 shutter is opened, the slope increases again until a stable deposition is reached at approximately 3000s after the process was started. When the MAI shutter is closed the deposition rate decreases slightly due to the missing MAI flux indicating the post-deposition of PbI2.\nThe deposition processes were monitored with the in\u00a0situ XRD system attached to the evaporation chamber as displayed in Fig.\u00a03. Here, the evolution of the XRD intensity is color-coded in color maps where the x-axis represents the evolution of process time and the y-axis represents the diffraction angle. The color maps are normalized to the maximum value of each measurement. All peaks which are visible from the beginning either belong to the substrate (glass/ITO/NiO) or the substrate carrier and will not be discussed here. The detector assembly has two blind spots at 17.5\u25e6 and 26.5\u25e6.\nEva 1 did not show any signs of crystallization or crystalline thin film growth; no peaks correlated to MAPI, MAI or PbI2 were observable. However, visually, the substrates were dark after the co-evaporation process and SEM cross-sections confirmed deposition of a thin film of 300nm. For the case of Eva 2, a PbI2 (001) peak at 12.5\u25e6 16 can be observed starting approximately 30min after the beginning of the process. After approximately 60min, tetragonal MAPI (110) and (114) peaks17 at 14\u25e6 and 31.5\u25e6 , respectively, become visible. For the third evaporation scheme with MAI pre-evaporation (EVA 3), no PbI2 peak was detected. The tetragonal MAPI peaks appeared earlier at approximately 45min and with increased intensity relative to the substrate peaks.\nSEM and EDX measurements. Figure\u00a04 displays cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the absorbers. The absorber thickness of Eva 1-3 was measured to be approximately 300nm, only Eva 4 was slightly thinner at approximately 250nm. In between the absorber and the ITO layer (ca. 180nm), the NiO layer can be identified as a slim, bright line with distinct grain structure and a thickness of approximately 25nm. The morphology of the EVA 1 absorber in Fig.\u00a04 shows round particles and some porosity, while for the absorber of Eva 2 no distinct granular structure is observed, but a rather homogeneous cross-section. For Eva 3 and Eva 4, clearly distinguishable granular structures of few tens to one hundred nanometers can be distinguished. Further discussion and morphology images can be found in the supporting information.\nDetecting lighter elements like carbon or nitrogen was not possible with sufficient accuracy in the used setup18, impeding the direct quantification of methylammonium via EDX. In Table\u00a01 the results of the EDX measurements for Pb and I are listed for comparison of all processes. The stoichiometric perovskite has the chemical formula ABX319 leading to a nominal IPb ratio of 3. We evaluate the stoichiometry according to the [I] to [Pb] ratio I\nPb , where values above 3 would be expected for MAI-rich absorbers and values below 3 indicate\nPbI2-rich perovskites. We conclude that all absorbers had a near stoichiometric composition, with Eva 1, 2 and 4 being slightly PbI2-rich, while Eva 3 (with pre-deposited MAI) was slightly MAI-rich (I/Pb ratio of 3.08).\nTRPL measurements. The influence of a post-deposited PbI2 top layer (Eva 4) was analyzed qualitatively by TRPL measurements of the absorber from the top side.

Attenuation of the laser intensity to 0, 001 \u00b7 I0 was made possible by using a neutral gray filter.\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:19167 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23132-w\nest laser ( I0 ) intensities that were used in a series of different intensities. We did not detect any photo degradation during these measurements and during subsequent control measurements.\nIn general, the observed photoluminescence decays are not strictly mono-exponential, indicating a combination of recombination processes20. The decay times for the low intensity curves are approximately similar for both evaporation schemes. A built-in electric field rapidly separating the generated charge carriers is one possible explanation for the short decay times at low injection levels, an effect that would be counterbalanced by the generated photovoltage at higher injection levels. At high illumination conditions, the measured signal is significantly different between Eva 3 and Eva 4. The faster decay of Eva 4 could be explained by improved charge carrier extraction due to the post-evaporated lead iodide layer. This would result in less charge carrier accumulation and therefore quenching of the TRPL signal.\nj\u2011V analysis. After completing the solar cell devices by deposition of ETL and contact layers, j-V curves were measured under simulated AM1.5 sun light in ascending and descending voltage sweep directions. The j-V curves of the best performing solar cells measured in ascending and descending direction are plotted for each evaporation run exemplary in Fig.\u00a06, while averaged solar cell parameters are listed in Table\u00a02. A more detailed analysis of the data distribution of the solar cell parameters for each evaporation scheme can be found in the supporting information.\nFigure\u00a06. j-V characterisation of Eva 1 (top left), Eva 2 (top right), Eva 3 (bottom left) and Eva 4 (bottom right).\n7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:19167 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23132-w\nThe best solar cell for the simultaneous (no pre-/post-deposition) evaporation scheme (Eva 1, top left graph in Fig.\u00a06) resulted in a device with rectifying behaviour, an open circuit voltage around 900mV, low fill factor (42 % in ascending and 57 % in descending direction) and little hysteresis. Due to the rather low short circuit current density of less than 3mA/cm2 , the efficiency of the best device for this evaporation scheme was limited to approximately 1 %. When PbI2 is pre-evaporated (EVA 2, top right graph), the performance of the corresponding solar cells is even lower, mainly because of the drastically decreased fill factor (38% in both directions). The j-V curve now nearly shows no rectifying behaviour and the average efficiency of all solar cells from this evaporation scheme was limited to well below 1 %. This stands in clear contrast to our expectations and the results from Heinze et\u00a0al. in10, where the PbI2 pre-evaporation had led to an increased short circuit current density and overall performance in n-i-p based solar cells.\nOn the contrary, a large improvement in the short circuit current density was observed for EVA 3 (bottom left), were MAI instead of PbI2 was pre-evaporated. For this evaporation scheme, solar cell efficiencies exceeding 6 % were obtained. A further improvement was observed by additional post-deposition of PbI2 (Eva 4, bottom right): here, the efficiency of the best solar cell is elevated to 6.7 % (descending) and 6.8% (ascending). This increase is mainly due to the better open circuit voltage exceeding 1V and an improved fill factor (above 70 %).\nOverall solar cell efficiencies of the devices presented in this work are well below the current state-of-theart of evaporated perovskite solar cells. Despite this, a clear impact of the evaporation scheme on the solar cell performance can be observed in both the j-V curves of the best cells and the list of averaged parameters. We would like to stress the fact that we have reproduced these results and that the co-evaporation methodology and equipment employed here are identical to the ones presented in our previous publication (10) and therefore have proven to provide absorber-grade MAPI with reasonable efficiencies. Despite our efforts, in the inverted p-i-n configuration we have not been able so far to produce solar cells with co-evaporated MAPI exceeding 8% efficiency, in contrast to the regular n-i-p configuration where we achieved efficiencies around 15%. As the same processing conditions have been applied, we believe that the main problems of our p-i-n devices lay still in the contacting layers, which demand further optimization.\nThe main reasoning for this is that the deposition parameters used in this work corresponded to the ones used in our prior publication on the regular solar cell structure, where indeed satisfying device efficiencies had been obtained. The underperformance of the devices presented in the current work is therefore not expected to be related to the absorber growth conditions per se, but must be somehow related to the variation of the substrate/contact layers.\nHowever, in view of the comparable processing conditions we are able to draw several valuable and important conclusions taking into account our current and the previous work as will be discussed in the following."

            "text": "B\u00e6kbo et\u00a0al. showed that decomposition of MAI into smaller structures (mainly HI and CH3NH2 ) occurs when MAI is evaporated13. The adsorption kinetics were described by Kim et\u00a0al. discussing the adsorption of PbI2 and MAI on the substrate surface21. Both groups only measured a minor impact of the MAI flux on the quartz crystal balance. Therefore the suggestion of Kim et\u00a0al. was made that the nucleation process consists of a seed layer of PbI2 which is used as preferential bond for the MAI components. MAPI is then formed by diffusion processes of MAI through the seed PbI2 layers. These diffusion processes were also described for PbCl2 by B\u00e6kbo et\u00a0al. and Chen et\u00a0al. while the latter work showed a conversion of a 150nm PbCl2 layer into MAPbCl313,22. For simultaneous evaporations, Parrott et\u00a0al. showed that the growth starts with nucleation of small islands of 8nm height23. Heinze et\u00a0al. showed that an initial crystallization of PbI2 is possible during simultaneous evaporation depending on the targeted chamber pressure10.\nHere, we observed that the pre/post-deposition of one of the two precursors in dual source co-evaporation of perovskite absorbers has a strong impact on the absorber properties and solar cell performance. Interestingly, PbI2 seed layers (Eva 2) neither lead to better crystallization nor improved solar cell performance. The in\u00a0situ XRD showed that the PbI2 seed layers pre-deposited in Eva 2 were not fully converted to MAPI, but remained unreacted throughout the deposition. Therefore, a diffusion-driven formation of MAPI was, at least, not completed. Heinze et\u00a0al. reported an increase of solar cell efficiency with the pre-evaporation of PbI2 in the n-i-p structure, even with remaining PbI2 XRD peaks10. We therefore conclude that the PbI2 itself is not necessarily detrimental to the absorber, e.g. by introducing deep defects at the MAPI/PbI2 interface. On the contrary, PbI2 has been claimed to have a passivating effect in several works24,25. The detrimental effect of the PbI2 seed layers in this work are therefore attributed to their location at the HTL side in the p-i-n structure. In fact, depositing PbI2 at the ETL side of the device through post-deposition showed an improvement (EVA 4), similar to the seed layers in the n-i-p structure of Heinze et\u00a0al10.\nFurthermore, it was seen that only the processes with an MAI seed layer (Eva 3 and Eva 4) achieved an absorber structure with a distinct granular structure, and an improved solar cell performance. Muscarella et\u00a0al. showed that the crystal plane orientation does not necessarily determine the electronic or optic properties, but Hsiao et\u00a0al. assume a positive effect of larger grains because of less interfaces as recombination centres between the contacts14,26.\nOu et\u00a0al. found that the electronic properties of MAPI highly depend on the MAI/PbI2 ratio allowing different doping states from p-doped to n-doped which is caused by the placement of donator defects in the crystal lattice27. However, the electronic properties are not only influenced by the electrons and holes as charge carriers. Eames et\u00a0al. showed the ionic migration of iodine and therefore effects on the band diagram in dependence of the stoichiometry to occur in MAPI28. The EDX measurements revealed that the films prepared during the course of this work were on average either nearly stoichiometric, or slightly PbI2-rich. With reference to the work of Ou et\u00a0al., this implies that the MAPI absorbers on average are intrinsic or n-doped to different extents.\n8 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:19167 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23132-w\nIn order to explain the measured differences in solar cell performance, we present two hypothetical models as thought experiments. Figures\u00a07 and 8 show illustrations of these possible effects of the different evaporation schemes on the electronic structure of our devices. The graphs present schematic sketches of possible band diagrams, where the placements of valence band, conduction band and Fermi level correspond to the literature data as measured by PES in references24,29\u201333.\nAccording to these data from literature, due to the band offset in the valence band, an incomplete conversion of the PbI2 layer covering the NiO (Eva 2) would lead to a hole blocking barrier as displayed in the band diagram presented in Fig.\u00a07. Such an energy barrier for the holes traveling towards the HTL might drastically decrease the solar cell performance. Numerical calculations based on experimental data already showed the possibility and effect of such a band offset for a PbI2/MAPI interface34.\nIf unconverted PbI2 (Eva 4) is placed on top of the absorber, however, the effect would be opposite: Here, adjacent to the ETL, a blocking of the holes while letting the electrons pass through would actually support the filtering effect of the ETL.\nTRPL measurements show that the decay times for high illumination intensities are reduced for the samples with PbI2 post-deposition. One possible explanation is a larger density of trapping defects in the case of the pure MAPI layer or MAPI/PCBM interface, which would artificially prolong the observed decay time beyond the charge carrier lifetime through re-emission from the trap states35. A removal of the trap states at the interface by passivation with PbI2 would in turn lead to reduced TRPL decay times, which is one possible interpretation of our TRPL data.\nGolubev et\u00a0al. numerically investigated the impact of buffer layers especially for a MAPI/C60 interface. They calculated the influence of defect states on the open circuit voltage, which increases for a smaller number of these states36.\nFurthermore, their numerical investigations were built on the experimental work of Liu et\u00a0al., who reported a significant decrease in photoluminescence (PL) intensity and an increase in solar cell performance after placing a C 60 layer on top of a perovskite37,38. The numerical studies showed that this performance increase is probably a result of higher charge carrier mobility at the perovskite/C60 interface, and therefore an improved charge transport across this interface36. This explains the decrease in PL by improved charge carrier extraction from the absorber, which leads to less radiative recombination and thus, lower PL intensity. The post-deposited PbI2 layer could act in a similar way as the C 60 buffer layer does, because the decay times at high intensities in our experiments were smaller as compared to the sample without post-deposition, while the open circuit voltage increased. These considerations would also match the research of Jacobsson et\u00a0al., who studied the influence of\nFigure\u00a07.

The middle image shows the solar cell with an additional layer of PbI2 on top of the NiO (Eva 2). The right image shows the case of an unconverted lead iodide layer on top of the MAPI absorber (Eva 4).\nFigure\u00a08. Schematic illustration of the band diagrams resulting from doping gradients within the MAPI absorber. Here, the blue circle illustrates the electrons and the red circle the holes. The left image shows the solar cell with a fully converted MAPI absorber without stoichiometry variations/gradients (Eva 1). The middle image shows a MAPI absorber with MAI-rich stoichiometry at the NiO interface and PbI2-rich stoichiometry at the ETL interface (Eva 4). The right image shows a MAPI absorber whose stoichiometry is PbI2-rich at the NiO interface and MAI rich on top of the absorber (Eva 2).\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:19167 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23132-w\nremnant lead iodide on the MAPI absorber24. They found that lead iodide excess can improve the charge carrier extraction and leads to a quenching of the PL. This would be a second possible interpretation of the observed reduction of TRPL decay times in combination with an improved open circuit voltage. Additional measurements in this respect are needed to lead to more conclusive results.\nA different thought model explaining the performance increase for the pre/post-deposition schemes is displayed in Fig.\u00a08. As discussed before, the stoichiometry has a direct influence on the MAPI doping27. The n-i-p structure showed improved performance when PbI2 was pre-evaporated10,13. Even for fully converted PbI2 layers, it could be expected that the first MAPI layers after PbI2 pre-evaporation would possess a PbI2-rich stoichiometry. In the case of the p-i-n structure this would lead to n-doped areas of MAPI close to the HTL27,39,40. The other way around, a pre-deposition of MAI would lead to a p-doped absorber interface adjacent to the HTL.\nFollowing this line of thought, the pre- and post-evaporations induce stoichiometry gradients in the absorber, which in turn result in doping gradients and a band bending of the absorber at the interfaces. If the band bending fits the alignment of the ETL and HTL, the charge carrier separation\u00a0and migration to the corresponding contacts is supported. Otherwise the charge extraction is impeded. This would also mean that even if the layers of pre-deposited\u00a0 PbI2 were fully converted to MAPI in the (inverted) p-i-n structure, this setup is not preferable due to the mismatching band bending. Transferring these considerations to the pre-evaporation of MAI and the post-evaporation of PbI2 (Eva 4), the absorber would be p-doped on the NiO interface (MAI-rich), intrinsic in the bulk (stoichiometric) and n-doped at the PCBM interface (PbI2-rich), a configuration which would support charge extraction. These scenarios are depicted schematically in Fig.\u00a08.\nWhile we are unable to distinguish between the two hypotheses or confirm them further at this point, we present them here in order to inspire further thoughts along this line and would like to encourage additional research in this direction. It is clear, that both effects could also occur to different extends in parallel."

            "text": "This work showed that the pre-deposition of PbI2 in the inverted p-i-n structure (Eva 2) is strongly detrimental for perovskite solar cell performance, in contrast to our previous results for solar cells in the regular n-i-p configuration. On the contrary, the pre-evaporation of MAI in combination with the post-evaporation of PbI2 is beneficial (Eva 4) and showed the best solar cell efficiencies. While the pre-evaporation of MAI strongly improved the short circuit current density, the PbI2 post-deposition mainly resulted in an increased fill factor and open circuit voltage.\nTwo thought models potentially explaining the influence of the sequential evaporations schemes on the measured performance have been portrayed. The first model presumes the evaporation of an unconverted PbI2 layer to create an energy barrier for the holes in the p-i-n structure due to the mismatched band offset24,29\u201333. This would be beneficial at the ETL interface (post deposition of PbI2 ), but not desirable at the HTL side. The second model assumes a conversion of pre- and post-evaporated layers, but with a remaining stoichiometry gradient, ultimately resulting in a doping profile within the absorber. By pre- and post-evaporation of MAI and/or PbI2 , it is possible to tune the doping of the MAPI at the top/bottom interface and therefore create a band bending which aids or hinders the charge carrier separation13,21,27,39,40. Both models are not in conflict with each other and in practice a combination of both effects is considered to be most likely.\nFor the first time different pre- and post-deposition sequences have been applied to MAPI solar cells in p-i-n configuration. Our results underline the importance to consider stoichiometry variations within the absorber and at the absorber interface during processing, especially in view of industrial in-line processing with nonstationary substrates. Together with our previous results, this work stresses the\u00a0importance of initial and final steps of a co-evaporation process and sheds light onto the basic concepts of non-stationary processing schemes stimulating both exciting further scientific investigations and innovative technological processing options. We are confident that our results and lines of thought will enable and trigger a wide range of further research activities on dynamic and pre/post-evaporation schemes for co-evaporated solar cell absorbers."
