    "abstractText": "People typically purchase residential properties for two reasons: to live in or invest. However, both purposes necessitate careful consideration before deciding because high financial costs are involved, and housing loans are typically considered necessary for this purpose. Customers\u2019 demands are constantly changing, becoming more complicated with higher requirements. The focus of this research is on tourism real estate selection. This market in Vietnam is still new and emerging and has encountered numerous issues regarding government policy, finance, and land authorization for constructing, owning, and managing. Because the form of tourism real estate is still new, customers are hesitant about investing in or buying these properties. Hence, to compete in the current fiercely real estate industry, real estate firms must understand their customers\u2019 expectations by frequently involving customer research in the company\u2019s strategy. However, there is still a lack of research on the connection between these factors and individual expectations in the well-known philosophy of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), leading to behavioral intentions. Therefore, to fulfill the gap in the previous literature, this paper aims to investigate the connection between these factors with core variables of TPB, hence, addressing the current problems in the real estate industry. 471 valid respondents in Vietnam were collected for data analysis through two survey approaches. PLS-SEM was used to test hypotheses due to the relationship complication in the conceptual models. The results show that government policy influences attitudes and perceived behavioral control, whereas social infrastructure affects social norms and perceived behavioral control. Moreover, Fengshui ambient condition also positively influences all three core factors: attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control. Finally, these factors impact on intention to buy tourism real estate. Through results, this paper has developed a purchase intention model through social aspects of the tourism real estate industry. In addition, this paper demonstrates the connection between social factors and individuals\u2019 expectations for a purchase intention, providing the importance of the government\u2019s role, architecture style, and social infrastructure in the marketing literature of the real estate industry. As a result, managers and governments need to take advantage of new releases of government regulations in time to enhance customers\u2019 positive attitudes toward purchasing tourism real estate. Moreover, social infrastructure and Fengshui conditions are PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281436 July 27, 2023 1 / 13 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111",

            "text": "People typically purchase residential properties for two reasons: to live in or invest. However, both purposes necessitate careful consideration before deciding because high financial costs are involved, and housing loans are typically considered necessary for this purpose. Government policies play an essential role in customers\u2019 decision-making process regarding buying real estate. For example, government incentives for housing purchases can increase the sale of houses [1]. Social infrastructure is another critical element affecting customers\u2019 attitudes towards housing constructions, affecting their willingness to buy those buildings. According to Vischer [2], users make judgments about constructions and other designed facilities based on personal experiences and interrelations with them, which is opposed to experts who design and build facilities and infrastructure but may never use them [3]. When purchasing real estate, buyers usually consider Fengshui, predominantly Asian customers, as another factor. According to Lin et al. [4], FengShui is an important factor for many Chinese in making choices such as where to live, where to work, where to bury their loved ones, where to place buildings, and how to design both the inside and outside of of the buildings. Fengshui is not only used in Asian and nearby countries but also in Western countries; for example, Fengshui principles have been involved in the various design of Western architecture and interior decoration projects [5].\nCustomer demands are constantly changing and have become more complicated with\nhigher requirements. The focus of this research is on the tourism real estate industry. This market in Vietnam is still new and emerging and has encountered numerous issues regarding government policy, finance, and land authorization for constructing, owning, and managing. Because the form of tourism real estate is still new, customers are hesitant about investing in or buying these properties. Hence, to compete in the current fiercely tourism real estate industry, real estate firms must understand their customers\u2019 expectations by frequently involving customer research in the company\u2019s strategy.\nSeveral papers examined the factors that affect customers\u2019 intention to buy tourism real\nestate, including the government policy, social infrastructure, and Fengshui conditions. However, there is still a lack of research on the connection between these factors and individual expectations in the well-known philosophy of TPB, leading to behavioral intentions. Therefore, to fill the gap in previous research, this study applied three core elements of TPB that shape an individual\u2019s behavioral intentions: attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control [6]. As a result, this paper aims to investigate the connection among these factors with core variables of TPB, hence, addressing the current problems in the real estate industry."

Consequently, there are considerable government interventions in several nations\u2019 land markets [8]. Those interventions can include direct government control over land supply or land use rules and frequently disrupt the whole marketplace. For example, in 2016, the Chinese government initiated a policy known as \"reduce inventory.\" The strategy seeks to strengthen taxation and credit policies that support rational housing purchases, place a premium on satisfying a rigid need, and minimize housing inventory. Rural migrants are considered essential potential buyers in small cities under this program. Rural migrants benefit from reduced taxes and down payment obligations. Local authorities also promote housing purchases and make urban Hukou easily accessible [1].\nIn fact, according to Mohit and Azim [9], through research on residential satisfaction for\nnew advanced public low-cost accommodations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, people are assumed to investigate the physical characteristics of housing infrastructure and services depending on the current needs and priorities as well as some pre-determined standards created by government agencies, experts, and professionals. Furthermore, according to Zhang et al. [10], government policies (especially government incentives) had the greatest impact on purchase intentions, including buying real estate. This justified the case of the Vietnamese government when the 30-trillion-Vietnamese-dong Home Loan Package was launched in 2013 [11]. Since the program\u2019s inception, approximately 80% of apartment purchasers in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (HCMC) have taken advantage of the package [12]. Government policy towards tourism is also essential to customers\u2019 intention to buy tourism real estate. Moreover, Nguyen et al. [13] stated that tourism real estate developments are typically subject to more legal risks than regular infrastructure projects. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:\nH1: Government policy positively influences attitudes\nH2: Government policy positively influences social norm\nH3: Government policy positively influences perceived behavioral control\nH4: Government policy positively influences the intention to buy"

Several previous studies indicated that tourism satisfaction and behavior have been proven to be affected by the socioeconomic characteristics of a region, such as social infrastructure, transportation, tourism choices and amenities, and relative price behavior [15\u201317].\nIn addition, social infrastructure plays an important role in purchasing tourism real estate.\nAccording to Lee et al. [18], in terms of sociocultural management, infrastructure should be accommodated people with disabilities. A study of 156 residents in progressively created lowincome public housing in Ogun State, Nigeria, discovered that one of the three most significant aspects of housing is the accessibility of social infrastructure [19]. Specifically, social infrastructure, including water supply, sanitation, and waste management facilities, is one of the essential factors for adequate housing. According to McCray and Weber [20], sufficient housing perception is a composite image of all aspects of the surroundings required to maintain a minimum acceptable quality of life. They said that cultural context, housing norms and values,\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281436 July 27, 2023 3 / 13\nand experience with various home characteristics and norms, all influence these images.

After that, it was expanded to other Asian countries such as Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, and so on [22, 23]. Moreover, Mak and Ng [24] indicated that the Compass School and the Form School are Fengshui\u2019s two primary schools of thought and practice. The Form School, according to Wu et al. [25], emphasizes Fengshui depending on the assessment of the physical surroundings, such as a mountain and a river. The theory is founded on the geography of the constructions and settings. In the Fengshui design framework, Mak and Ng [24] developed four design modules: surrounding environment, external layout, internal layout and interior arrangement. Regarding the surrounding environment, there are seven criteria and 14 related fengshui factors as illustrated in S1 Table.\nLuk et al. [26] stated in their model on customers\u2019 opinions of Fengshui that customers have three perspectives on Fengshui, including instrumental, spiritual, and minimalist. In terms of instrumental viewpoint, customers believe that Fengshui designs can influence their luck and fortune. According to the spiritual perspective, consumers consider Fengshui to be a component of their spiritual lives and cultural identities. Consumers regard Fengshui as pure superstition, according to the minimalist viewpoint. Furthermore, Sia et al. [27] stated that house purchasers that take an instrumental perspective on Fengshui will purchase homes with favorable Fengshui factors that will bring them the best of luck and fortune. They would avoid purchasing houses with unfavorable Fengshui elements that could bring them bad luck and tragedy. Therefore, in this study, we develop the following hypotheses:\nH8: Fengshui ambient conditions positively influences attitude\nH9: Fengshui ambient conditions positively influences social norm\nH10: Fengshui ambient conditions positively influences perceived behavioral control"

The TPB framework predicts behavioral intention based on three components: attitude toward behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control [6]. Attitude is defined as an individual\u2019s positive or negative appraisal of the execution of specific behavior, considers subjective norm as a social component referring to felt social pressure to do or refrain from performing a specific behavior, and views perceived behavioral control as the perception of the difficulty level of carrying out that behavior, which is influenced by prior experiences and anticipated obstacles.\nTPB has been used to predict customer intentions and behavior in a variety of contexts, including green residence [28], green goods [29], green housing [30\u201332], green hotels [33], and electric vehicles [34]. As a result, TPB is a valuable paradigm for defining ecologically\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281436 July 27, 2023 4 / 13\nresponsible conduct [10, 33]. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [35] observed that the TPB partially favors acquiring industrial brownfield real estate. When people\u2019s perceived behavioral control is substantial, they are more likely to execute their behavioral intentions and report intentions consistent with their views and subjective norm [36]. Hence, we proposed three following hypotheses:\nH11: Attitudes positively influence the intention to buy\nH12: Social norm positively influences the intention to buy\nH13: Perceived behavioral control positively influences the intention to buy\nFig 1 presents the research model with hypothesis development."

In addition, the average variance extracted (AVE) values, used to measure the convergence validity, are acceptable, as values are higher than 0.5 ranging from 0.682 (Fengshui ambient conditions) to 0.896 (Social norm). Hence, the convergence validity of the data is ensured and the reliability is confirmed (see Table 2).\nThereafter, the square root of the AVEs was calculated for comparison with the correlations\nbetween every pair of latent variables. According to Table 3, no correlation coefficients are greater than the square root of AVEs; thus, discriminant validity is ensured, according to Fornell and Larcker\u2019s criteria [42].

Specifically, government policy moderately influences customers\u2019 attitudes toward real estate purchases. Moreover, social infrastructure has similar effects on both social norms and perceived behavioral control. Especially, Fengshui ambient conditions positively impacts all three outcome factors. Finally, attitudes have a weaker effect on intention to buy than social norms."

            "text": "This paper has successfully developed a model of tourism real estate purchase intention in the emerging market. First, the significant effects of government policy, social infrastructure, and Fengshui ambient conditions on attitudes, social norms perceived behavioral control contribute to the positive relationship between social factors and individuals\u2019 expectations of the current literature of the tourism real estate industry, extending the TPB [6] by adding external aspects such as the government role, the infrastructure attribute, and the architecture style into the model. In particular, government policy can enhance customers\u2019 attitudes toward tourism real estate, therefore, playing an essential role in reducing the high pressure on legality when buying such housing [13]. The insignificant effects of government policy on social norm perceived behavioral control and purchase intention indicates that such policy only can influence an individual\u2019s attitude, who has specific purposes for their housing purchase rather than establishing a belief in a social group. Moreover, tourism real estate is a premium product in which customers must be qualified enough to participate in the market. By contrast, social infrastructure tends to the community rather than individual\u2019s aspects; hence, social infrastructure can positively influence social norm and create a feeling of behavioral control, especially for disabled people. This explains the insignificance of social infrastructure on customers\u2019 attitudes.\nMoreover, Fengshui ambient conditions are a popular architectural design for Asian and\nWestern cultures [5, 23]. Therefore, the positive relationship between Fengshui ambient conditions and the TPB\u2019s three core variables, including attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, are consistent with the philosophy of Sia et al. [27], in which housing purchase will be motivated by favorable Fengshui factors. As a result, a social norm based on the Fengshui principle was established in the tourism real estate market. Moreover, favorable Fengshui factors bring the feeling of fortune to customers, leading positive attitude toward the intention to purchase the housing."

            "text": "This paper also brings practical implications the management. In particular, although government policy does not influence social norms, it can enhance customers\u2019 attitudes toward real estate tourism. Therefore, it reduces the feeling of risks of legality when buying such housing. Consequently, real estate managers should take advantage of these policies whenever the government enacts favorable housing laws to encourage customers\u2019 demand and create positive attitudes toward purchasing tourism real estate. In addition, marketers should show customers a favorable market for tourism real estate based on a deep knowledge of current government policies and new release regulations, in which positive attitudes can motivate intention to purchase, and it would be a good opportunity for salespeople to bring it to actual purchases.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281436 July 27, 2023 9 / 13\nBesides, social norms were found out to be the most influential predictor of intention to purchase tourism real estate. Therefore, managers should focus on factors that can enhance social norms. Moreover, this paper provides two fundamental constructs that can improve social norms, including Fengshui ambient conditions and social infrastructure. For example, essential attributes of the social infrastructure consist of recreational/sporting facilities, cultural activities, distance to favorite places, and transportation conditions. In addition, key success aspects of Fengshui ambient conditions comprise of lighting, maintenance, safety, fresh air, green areas, directions of door, wind, or balcony, and thermal comfort. All these factors should be included in brochures when introducing real estate to customers to develop optimal marketing strategies."

            "text": "Although this paper has brought some novel insights into both practice and literature, there are still inevitable limitations that should be applied with caution. First, the online survey makes it difficult to control the respondents\u2019 understandability of the questionnaire\u2019s content. Therefore, to reduce the bias from this limitation, this research cleaned the data before the data analysis by deleting invalid responses (e.g., less than 1 minute of completion or the same reactions for all questions). Moreover, this research only focused on the direct effects of social factors on TPB\u2019s constructs but did not examine the possible mediating effects of these factors on intention to buy through social norms, perceived behavioral control, and attitudes. Therefore, further research should take an additional step to examine this mediation in the tourism real estate purchase intention model. In addition, demographic variables are considered essential moderators in much previous marketing research but were not examined in this research. Therefore, further research could examine possible moderating effects of demographic variables such as gender, age, or education level, which can provide different results in the relationships between constructs in the tourism real estate model.\nSupporting information"
