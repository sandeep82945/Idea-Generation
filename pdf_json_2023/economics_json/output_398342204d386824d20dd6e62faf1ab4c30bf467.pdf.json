We then develop an evaluation model of CPL based on prospect theory, probabilistic linguistic ordered weighted distance measure, and the TOPSIS method, wherein we use a probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) to describe the uncertainty and complexity of the assessment process. Above all, we use prospect theory to reflect the preferences of experts to meet the unique needs for the evaluation of common prosperity. Moreover, we apply the proposed evaluation index system and model to evaluate the CPL of Zhejiang Province, China\u2019s first common prosperity demonstration zone, as an example to conduct relevant research. The advantages and e ectiveness of the proposed method are verified by the sensitivity and comparative analysis.\nResults: The findings prove that the application of the new PLTS evaluation framework in CPL assessment is robust.\nDiscussion: We propose specific suggestions for improving the development of common prosperity.\nKEYWORDS\ncommon prosperity, probabilistic linguistic term, prospect theory, ordered weighted distance measure, TOPSIS\n1. Introduction\nThe idea of common prosperity in China can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn and the Warring States Periods, approximately 2,000 years ago. Originally, it represented absolute egalitarianism. However, in contemporary China, the purpose of common prosperity is to promote fair income distribution and improve people\u2019s living standards, which also includes ideas such as sharing and development (Chen et al., 2022). In the existing research, some scholars highlight that social progress should simultaneously examine the overall development level and the living conditions of people with low standards of living (Kakwani et al., 2022; Zhang J. et al., 2022). Therefore, common prosperity is the achievement of a well-fed standard of living for all members of society. It is a\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\ndifferential wealth based on universal wealth but not egalitarianism. Common prosperity is the integration of two aspects\u2014common and prosperity. The latter can be expressed as the abundance of social wealth and advanced productivity. Common prosperity means that members of society achieve a good standard of living through labor, thereby eliminating the polarization between the rich and the poor (Qian et al., 2021).\nCommon prosperity is an important requirement of socialism and an essential feature of Chinese-style modernization (Ja, 2022). The practice of common prosperity in China spans two centuries. As early as the 1950s, it is frequently mentioned by the Chinese government. The implementation of reform and opening up and the slogan first wealth to drive wealth later indicate that the construction of common prosperity has entered a new stage (Kong, 2022). In recent years, in the context of building a moderately prosperous society in China, the government is vigorously promoting the ideal of achieving common prosperity. In 2021, Zhejiang province was designated a common prosperity demonstration zone, shouldering the important historical mission of developing and building a highquality and common prosperity area.\nHowever, exploring the implementation and development of the common prosperity level (CPL) is more complicated than addressing other practical problems. In the context of modern research problems of increasing depth, there are obvious restrictions on traditional evaluation methods based on accurate values. The main reason is that the accurate evaluation information makes it difficult to describe policymakers\u2019 preferences for indicators and programs and also does not reveal the uncertainty of prospects. In the face of relatively complex evaluation objects, evaluators or decision-makers may be hesitant to evaluate, which leads to the lack of a certain basis for the results. Therefore, the traditional evaluation methods based on accurate values have obvious shortcomings in dealing with complex problems; that is, the data in the evaluation process cannot be completely and accurately obtained in practical cases. Therefore, we adopt the fuzzy evaluation method in which experts describe their evaluations and preferences through various fuzzy assessments in a complex multi-index comprehensive evaluation environment.\nThe fuzzy set theory (Zadeh, 1965) was first invented by Zadeh in 1965. Later, fuzzy evaluation branch methods evolved, including using language variables (Zadeh, 1974), which is one of the more understandable methods to represent fuzzy concepts. To solve the problem of choosing among multiple linguistic terms, Rodriguez combined the linguistic term set (Rodriguez et al., 2012) and the hesitant fuzzy set (Torra, 2010) and proposed a hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) that includes multiple linguistic variables of the same weight. However, due to the limitations of the weights of linguistic terms, HFLTSs lack applicability in practical problems that need to reflect different degrees of importance. Therefore, considering the diversity and flexibility of linguistic information expression, Pang et al. (2016) proposed a probability linguistic term set (PLTS) by introducing probability information based on the HFLTS. PLTS has been widely used for its special advantages, such as project evaluation (Peng et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020), environmental impact assessment (Tian et al., 2020; Su et al.,\n2023), and text sentiment analysis (Song et al., 2020; Yu and Pan, 2021).\nConsidering the great fuzziness of the concept of common prosperity, there exist difficulties in determining the weight of fuzzy indicators when using fuzzy evaluation to solve the problem of common prosperity. While prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) has a good performance in dealing with such problems, which is specifically embodied in that it can reflect the different psychological characteristics of decision-makers when they face gains and losses in actual decisions. Prospect theory can help people make decisions under uncertain circumstances and can reflect the preferences of decision-makers. Hence, prospect theory has attracted extensive attention and has been gradually applied in various areas, so it is introduced in the process of CPL evaluation and the fuzzy set theory in this study.\nSimilar to other evaluation problems (Zeng et al., 2013a, 2017), using the classic distance between PLTS as the basis for the evaluation and measurement of CPL problems is inadequate. Therefore, we need to explore a suitable distance measure to handle the CPL problems. There exist various distance metrics to choose from when the decision-maker makes a decision, such as the Minkowski distance (Merig\u00f3 and Gil-Lafuente, 2008), Hamming distance (Hamming, 1950), and ordered weighted distance (OWD) (Xu and Chen, 2008; Merigo and Casanovas, 2011). Among these, the OWD, a useful extension of the ordered weighted operator (OWA) (Yager, 1988), has the advantage of obtaining better results and reaching a consensus faster. Then, the weight of the OWD measure can be set according to the requirements of the problem\nto enhance or alleviate the influence of large or small differences in the integrated results. In addition, Xu and Xia (2011) combined the OWD method with a hesitant fuzzy case and extended the theory of hesitant fuzzy OWD. Zeng et al. (2013a) extended the OWD to an intuitionistic fuzzy environment and proposed the\nintuitionistic fuzzy OWD measure. Recently, Liu et al. (2022) proposed a combination of PLTS and OWD and developed the probabilistic linguistic term OWD (PTLOWD) measure enriching\ndistance theory in the context of PLTSs. Additional extensions and research concerning the OWD measure are available (Zeng et al.,\n2012, 2013b, 2017, 2023; Peng et al., 2014; Dai, 2020; Yang et al., 2022).\nBased on the above literature review, we find that there are still few studies on the application of the prospect theory in the direction of PLTOWD. In this study, the prospect theory endows the PLTOWD operator with the ability to consider the influence\nof psychological factors on experts in decision-making procedures, meaning that it can overcome the subjective value cognition caused\nby decision anticipation to reflect the preference of decisionmakers.\nThe gap between rural and urban areas has been narrowing, and the residents\u2019 happiness index has steadily increased, indicating that the common prosperity of Zhejiang province has begun to materialize. However, we identified the following several issues to be addressed as follows:\n(1) The CPL evaluation process is ambiguous and complex, and\na scientific evaluation index system for the level of common prosperity is required.\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\n(2) The improvement of the overall prosperity of Zhejiang province\ndoes not mean that all prefecture-level cities have reached this level, and there is a lack of an effective method for common prosperity evaluation in complex environments. (3) The existing PLTOWD has the disadvantage of not considering\nthe preferences of the decision-makers.\nTherefore, we select the prospect theory to solve the current drawback in this study. Furthermore, we apply the PTLTOWD measure to the TOPSIS model to evaluate the common prosperity level of cities in Zhejiang province. We derive an evaluation of construction experience and institutional models, leading to scientific and objective conclusions. The contributions of this study are reflected in the following four aspects:\n(1) We build a set of scientific evaluation index systems for the\ndevelopment of common prosperity;\n(2) We propose a new PLTOWDmeasure based on prospect theory; (3) We present a new evaluation framework based on the proposed\nPTPLTOWDmeasure to TOPSIS;\n(4) We extend the application of the presented method to the\nfield of common prosperity evaluation and use it to evaluate the common prosperity level of cities in Zhejiang province, obtaining a scientific evaluation result.\nThe rest structure of this manuscript is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a basic knowledge review. In section 3, the comprehensive evaluation index system for CPL is introduced. Section 4 offers a new evaluation framework based on PTPLTOWD and TOPSIS tool. Section 5 provides an empirical test on the common prosperity practice in Zhejiang province in China. Section 6 offers conclusions, main limitations, and future directions."

            "text": "The PLTOWD measure is an effective tool for processing qualitative information and its corresponding probability or importance. Although the PLTOWD expands the distance measure of probabilistic language, it is still too rigid in algorithmic composition and thinking, ignoring the psychological conditions and preferences of decision-makers, making the overall decision flexibility limited. In view of the above considerations, we have combined PLTOWD with the prospect theory, which has clear advantages: (1) It can incorporate the psychological factors of experts in the decision-making process; (2) it accounts for the expected gains and losses of the decision generating subjective value perceptions.\nIn this section, combined with the prospect theory, we proposed the prospect theory PLTOWD (PTPLTOWD) operator enriching the distance theory under the condition of probabilistic linguistics and applying it to the TOPSIS method. Let A = a1, a2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , am be the scheme set, C = c1, c2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cn be the attribute set, and construct a decision matrix= [ Pij ]\nm\u00d7n . The main steps of\nconstruction of the PTPLTOWD are presented below:\nStep 1: Selection of reference points. When applying the prospect theory, the choice of reference points directly affects the calculation of the value function. In practice, decision-makers have different subjective preferences, thus determining different reference points.\nAssumption 1: For optimistic decision-makers, when the distance measure is cost type, the decision reference point is DL =\ndPLT\n(\na\u03c3(j), b\u03c3(j)\n)\n, j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 n ; when the distance measure is of\nthe benefit type, then the decision reference point is DL = DL =\ndPLT\n(\na\u03c3(j), b\u03c3(j)\n)\n.\nAssumption 2: For pessimistic decision-makers, when the distance measure is cost type, the decision reference point is DB =\ndPLT\n(\na\u03c3(j), b\u03c3(j)\n)\n, j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 n; when the distance measure\nis of benefit type, then the decision reference point is DB =\ndPLT\n(\na\u03c3(j), b\u03c3(j)\n)\n.\nAssumption 3: For neutral decision-makers, whether the distance measure is cost or benefit, the decision reference point is DZ = 1n \u2211n j=1 dPLT ( a\u03c3(j), b\u03c3(j) ) .\nIn this study, we suppose the decision-makers are neutral and then construct a PTPLTOWD based on prospect theory and PLTOWD.\nStep 2: Calculate the distance from each scheme to the reference point. In this step, we need to calculate the 1x in Equation (8), which represents the distance of each scheme from the reference point in prospect theory.\nFor optimistic decision-makers of assumption 1:\n1x = d ( ai,D L ) = { ( Pi1,D L 1 ) , ( Pi2,D L 2 ) , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ( Pim,D L m ) }\nFor pessimistic decision-makers of assumption 2:\n1x = d ( ai,D B ) = { ( Pi1,D B 1 ) , ( Pi2,D B 2 ) , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ( Pim,D B m ) }\nFor neutral decision-makers of assumption 3:\n1x = d ( ai,D Z ) = { ( Pi1,D z 1 ) , ( Pi2,D z 2 ) , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ( Pim,D z m ) }.\nStep 3: Acquire the prospect value and weight. The calculation process of the prospect value is as follows: WithDZ as the reference point, Equation (8) is used to calculate the prospect value function of each scheme. For Vj can be positive or negative, and distance measurement can be divided into cost and benefit types. To make the prospect value all positive, the following conversion rules are implemented for all prospect values:\nV \u2032\nj = max {V1,V2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Vn} \u2212min {V1,V2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Vn} + Vj, (9)\nV \u2032\u2032\nj = max {V1,V2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Vn} \u2212min {V1,V2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Vn} \u2212 Vj, (10)\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nThe above Equation (9) represents the conversion of the prospect value calculated in the case of benefit-based distance measurement, and Equation (10) represents the conversion of the foreground value calculated in the case of cost-based distance measurement. After the conversion, V \u2032\nj and V \u2032\u2032 j are both positive\nnumbers, and the higher the value, the better.\nFor convenience, we utilize Vj to represent V \u2032 j and V \u2032\u2032 j . Furthermore, in the case application, all indicators are converted uniformly into benefit-based distance measurement in advance; that is, the prospect value Vj will be transformed according to Equation (9). The weight calculation method associated with the ordered weighted distance measure based on prospect theory is shown as follows:\n\u03d5j = Vj\n\u2211n j=1 Vj\n. (11)\nAfter the foreground value calculated in different situations is\nconverted, it is normalized to satisfy \u03d5j \u2208 [0, 1] and \u2211n j=1 \u03d5j = 1.\nStep 4: Determine the index weight. In this study, we construct\namulti-objective programmingmodel tominimize d\u03c9 ( Pij, P\u2217j ) and maximize d\u03c9 ( Pij, P#j ) to acquire the weight of attributes:\n    \n   \nmin d\u03c9 ( Pij, P\u2217j ) (i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m) max d\u03c9 ( Pij, P#j ) (i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m)\ns.t.\n{\n\u2211n j=1 (\u03c9j) 2 = 1\n\u03c9j \u2265 0, j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n\nFurthermore, the above multi-objective programming model\ncan be converted into\n  \n \nmin \u2211n j=1 \u03c9j \u2211m i=1 [d\u03c9 ( Pij, P\u2217j ) \u2212 d\u03c9 ( Pij, P#j ) ]\ns.t.\n{\n\u2211n j=1 (\u03c9j) 2 = 1\n\u03c9j \u2265 0, j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n\nLet xj = \u2211m i=1 [d\u03c9 ( Pij, P\u2217j ) \u2212 d\u03c9 ( Pij, P#j ) ], then we construct\nthe Lagrange function F = \u2211n j=1 \u03c9jxj + \u03bb[ \u2211n j=1 (\u03c9j) 2 \u2212 1], where \u03bb is the Lagrange multiplier. When the partial derivative of F with respect to \u03c9j(j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n) is 0, we have:\n{\n\u2202F \u2202\u03c9j\n= xj + 2\u03bb\u03c9j = 0 \u2202F \u2202\u03bb = (\u03c9j) 2 \u2212 1 = 0\nAfter solving the above equation, the optimal solution can be\nobtained as follows:\n\u03c9 \u2217 j = xj \u221a\n\u2211n j=1 (xj)\n2 , j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n,\nConsidering the normalization constraint of attribute weight, the final attribute weight can be obtained by referring to the following mathematical expression:\n\u03c9j = { \u2211m i=1 [d ( Pij, P\u2217j ) \u2212 d ( Pij, P#j ) ] 2\n\u2211n j=1 { \u2211m i=1 [d\n( Pij, P\u2217j ) \u2212 d ( Pij, P#j ) ]} 2 . (12)\nStep 5: Construct the PTPLTOWD measure.

Details are\npresented in Table 1.\nStep 2: Determine the PLTS-positive ideal scheme L\u2217 and\nPLTS-negative ideal scheme L#:\nL\u2217 =\n\n          \u3008c1, {s4 (0.1) , s5 (0.8) , s6 (0.1)}\u3009 , \u3008c2, {s5 (0.2) , s6 (0.8)}\u3009 , \u3008c3, {s4 (0.1) , s5 (0.1) , s6 (0.8)}\u3009 , \u3008c4, {s4 (0.1) , s5 (0.2) , s6 (0.7)}\u3009 , \u3008c5, {s4 (0.1) , s5 (0.6) , s6 (0.3)}\u3009 ,\n\u3008c6, {s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.5) , s6 (0.2)}\u3009 ,\n\u3008c7, {s4 (0.2) , s5 (0.3) , s6 (0.5)}\u3009\n\n         \nL# =\n\n         \n\u3008c1, {s0 (0.6) , s1 (0.4)}\u3009 , \u3008c2, {s0 (0.7) , s1 (0.2) , s2 (0.1)}\u3009 ,\n\u3008c3, {s0 (0.3) , s1 (0.7)}\u3009 ,\n\u3008c4, {s0 (0.5) , s1 (0.3) , s2 (0.2)}\u3009 ,\n\u3008c5, {s0 (0.6) , s1 (0.2) , s2 (0.2)}\u3009 ,\n\u3008c6, {s1 (0.2) , s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.4) , s4 (0.1)}\u3009 ,\n\u3008c7, {s0 (0.6) , s1 (0.4)}\u3009\n\n         \nStep 3: Calculate the distances d ( Pij, P\u2217j ) and d ( Pij, P#j ) between each scheme Ai and the positive and negative ideal solutions.\nStep 4: Obtain the index weights according to Equation (12):\n\u03c9 = [0.045, 0.089, 0.262, 0.182, 0.001, 0.356, 0.065].\nStep 5: Select the reference point. For neutral decision-makers, the reference points in the case of cost- and benefit-based distance measures are DZ = (\n1 n \u2211n j=1 d + ij , 1 n \u2211n j=1 d \u2212 ij\n)\n, respectively. The\nresults are presented in Table 2.\nStep 6: Calculate the distance 1x = (dx+, dx\u2212) between each scheme and its corresponding reference point (\n1 n \u2211n j=1 d + ij , 1 n \u2211n j=1 d \u2212 ij\n)\n. It is worth mentioning that the reference\npoints of each city are obtained by the distance between its probabilistic language and the optimal solution and the worst solution, respectively. Hence, its reference points are also a pair. 1 n \u2211n j=1 d + ij is the reference point obtained by the distance from the optimal solution, and 1n \u2211n j=1 d \u2212 ij is the reference point obtained by the deviation from the worst solution.\nStep 7: According to the obtained 1x, Vij is calculated by using Equations (9) and (16). For the reference points that are paired, the resulting prospect value is also paired. The prospect value V \u2217\nij given\nby the reference point 1n \u2211n j=1 d + ij is called the prospect value of the optimal reference point, while the prospect value V#ij given by the reference point 1n \u2211n j=1 d \u2212 ij is called the prospect value of the worst reference point.\nStep 8:According to the two groups of prospect values obtained above, the weight of prospect theory is calculated, respectively, as shown in Tables 3, 4. Among them,\u03c9\u2217 is the prospect theory weight obtained from the prospect value of the optimal reference point, which is called the prospect theory weight of the optimal reference point; \u03c9# is the prospect theory weight obtained from the prospect value of the worst reference point, which is called the prospect theory weight of the worst reference point.\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nTABLE 1 Probabilistic linguistic evaluation matrix.\nC1 C2 C3 C4\nA1 {s1 (0.5) , s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.2)} {s5 (0.2) , s6 (0.8)} {s4 (0.1) , s5 (0.1) , s6 (0.8)} {s4 (0.1) , s5 (0.2) , s6 (0.7)}\nA2 {s0 (0.4) , s1 (0.3) , s2 (0.2) , s3 (0.1)} {s5 (0.3) , s6 (0.7)} {s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.3) , s6 (0.4)} {s4 (0.2) , s5 (0.5) , s6 (0.3)}\nA3 {s0 (0.6) , s1 (0.4)} {s4 (0.2) , s5 (0.6) , s6 (0.2)} {s3 (0.1) , s4 (0.1) , s5 (0.6) , s6 (0.2)} {s4 (0.7) , s5 (0.3)}\nA4 {s2 (0.6) , s3 (0.2) , s4 (0.2)} {s3 (0.2) , s4 (0.5) , s5 (0.3)} {s4 (0.6) , s5 (0.4)} {s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.4) , s4 (0.3)}\nA5 {s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.3) , s4 (0.4)} {s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.5) , s4 (0.2)} {s3 (0.1) , s4 (0.7) , s5 (0.2)} {s3 (0.2) , s4 (0.8)}\nA6 {s3 (0.1) , s4 (0.8) , s5 (0.1)} {s3 (0.3) , s4 (0.7)} {s3 (0.2) , s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.4) , s6 (0.1)} {s3 (0.3) , s4 (0.6) , s5 (0.1)}\nA7 {s2 (0.2) , s3 (0.3) , s4 (0.5)} {s1 (0.1) , s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.4) , s4 (0.2)} {s2 (0.2) , s3 (0.6) , s4 (0.2)} {s1 (0.4) , s2 (0.5) , s3 (0.1)}\nA8 {s4 (0.1) , s5 (0.8) , s6 (0.1)} {s0 (0.5) , s1 (0.5)} {s1 (0.1) , s2 (0.5) , s3 (0.4)} {s0 (0.4) , s1 (0.3) , s2 (0.2) , s3 (0.1)}\nA9 {s4 (0.6) , s5 (0.4)} {s0 (0.4) , s1 (0.4) , s2 (0.2)} {s0 (0.3) , s1 (0.7)} {s0 (0.3) , s1 (0.5) , s2 (0.2)}\nA10 {s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.7)} {s0 (0.2) , s1 (0.5) , s2 (0.3)} {s2 (0.2) , s3 (0.5) , s4 (0.3)} {s2 (0.1) , s3 (0.6) , s4 (0.2) , s5 (0.1)}\nA11 {s3 (0.2) , s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.4) , s6 (0.1)} {s0 (0.7) , s1 (0.2) , s2 (0.1)} {s1 (0.6) , s2 (0.4)} {s0 (0.5) , s1 (0.3) , s2 (0.2)}\nC5 C6 C7\nA1 {s4 (0.1) , s5 (0.6) , s6 (0.3)} {s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.5) , s6 (0.2)} {s3 (0.2) , s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.5)}\nA2 {s4 (0.1) , s5 (0.6) , s6 (0.3)} {s3 (0.1) , s4 (0.6) , s5 (0.3)} {s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.3) , s6 (0.4)}\nA3 {s3 (0.1) , s4 (0.5) , s5 (0.4)} {s3 (0.3) , s4 (0.7)} {s3 (0.2) , s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.5)}\nA4 {s3 (0.4) , s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.2) , s6 (0.1)} {s3 (0.1) , s4 (0.2) , s5 (0.6) , s6 (0.1)} {s3 (0.3) , s4 (0.6) , s5 (0.1)}\nA5 {s3 (0.2) , s4 (0.7) , s5 (0.1)} {s3 (0.2) , s4 (0.2) , s5 (0.6)} {s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.5) , s4 (0.2)}\nA6 {s3 (0.4) , s4 (0.6)} {s3 (0.1) , s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.5) , s6 (0.1)} {s2 (0.2) , s3 (0.6) , s4 (0.2)}\nA7 {s1 (0.2) , s2 (0.5) , s3 (0.2) , s4 (0.1)} {s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.4) , s4 (0.3)} {s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.7)}\nA8 {s0 (0.6) , s1 (0.2) , s2 (0.2)} {s3 (0.1) , s4 (0.6) , s5 (0.3)} {s0 (0.4) , s1 (0.3) , s2 (0.3)}\nA9 {s0 (0.2) , s1 (0.5) , s2 (0.2) , s3 (0.1)} {s2 (0.2) , s3 (0.5) , s4 (0.2) , s5 (0.1)} {s0 (0.2) , s1 (0.3) , s2 (0.5)}\nA10 {s1 (0.2) , s2 (0.6) , s3 (0.2)} {s2 (0.2) , s3 (0.3) , s4 (0.3) , s5 (0.2)} {s1 (0.3) , s2 (0.6) , s3 (0.1)}\nA11 {s0 (0.5) , s1 (0.3) , s2 (0.2)} {s1 (0.2) , s2 (0.3) , s3 (0.4) , s4 (0.1)} {s0 (0.6) , s1 (0.4)}\nTABLE 2 Reference points of cities.\nDZ A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 A11\n1 n \u2211n j=1 d + ij 1.67 2.9 5.17 6.33 7.03 6.71 7.31 5.23 6.09 6.86 5.87 1 n \u2211n j=1 d \u2212 ij 5.31 5 4.3 4.29 4.04 4.47 2.36 2.13 1.24 2.39 0.83\nStep 9: d ( Pij, P\u2217j ) and d ( Pij, P#j ) ) are aggregated and ranked in\norder of largest to smallest.\nStep 10: According to Equations (17) and (18), calculate\ndistances PTPLTOWD \u2032 ( Ai,A \u2212 ) and PTPLTOWD \u2032 ( Ai,A + ) between each scheme and the positive and negative ideal alternatives.\nStep 11: Compute the relative closeness based on PTPLTOWD\nand Equation (19), which is shown in Table 5.\nIt can be observed that the development of common prosperity in the Zhejiang province\u2014Hangzhou, Ningbo, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, Huzhou, Taizhou, Quzhou, Jinhua, Zhoushan, and Lishui\u2014ranges from high to relatively low."

By comparing the closeness of 11 cities presented by the current two evaluation models, we illustrate the advantages and effectiveness of introducing the prospect theory in PTPLTOWD-TOPSIS proposed in this study.\nTo illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach, we first employ the general PLTOWDmeasure as a comparison. It is worth mentioning that the weight of the PLTOWD method here adopts the widely used normal distribution method (Xu and Chen, 2008), while the associated weights with the PTPLTOWD measure in this study are determined by the prospect theory. It can be found from Figure 3 that the two results of the first four cities, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Jiaxing, are relatively similar, while the two results of the next seven cities gradually show differences, among which, Quzhou has the largest difference. The main reason for this difference is that prospect theory reflects the preferences of decision-makers. At the same time, we can also find that cities that perform well under prospect theory perform well on some\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nindicators. As for the pure PLT operator, it is observed that it simply integrates the evaluation values of the indicators and does not reflect the gap between the aggregation results of the scheme and the positive and negative ideal alternatives.\nOverall, by considering prospect theory based on PLTOWD, the proposed PTPLTOWDmeasure accounts for the psychology of\ndecision-makers and is more responsive. It improves the subjective value or feelings of decision-makers when they face losses and gains in the actual decision-making process so that the conclusions are more scientific and reasonable."

The main innovation advantages of this study are as follows: (1) We proposed a PTPLTOWD measure based on prospect theory that is an extension of the PLTOWD measure and able to better reflect the preferences of decision-makers; (2) we extended the traditional TOPSIS method based on prospect theory and ordered the weighted measure to construct a novel PTPLTOWD-TOPSIS evaluation framework, providing a simpler and more efficient probabilistic linguistic decision-making method; (3) we constructed a set of scientific evaluation index systems for the common prosperity level by reading literature; and (4) we applied the presented method to the evaluation of the common prosperity level of cities in Zhejiang province and obtained a scientific evaluation result. The results are compared with the previous method, and the effect is remarkable. This demonstrates the practicability and effectiveness of the PTPLTOWD-TOPSIS approach. The evaluation of this study has a certain reference significance in reality. The findings show that the level of common prosperity of the 11 prefecture-level cities in Zhejiang province, ranked from high to relatively low, is Hangzhou, Ningbo, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, Huzhou, Taizhou, Quzhou, Jinhua, Zhoushan, and Lishui. Cities should make targeted improvements based on the shortcomings currently reflected to achieve common prosperity. Furthermore, it is observed that the PTPLOWD has a broad application prospect. In the future, it will be considered for application in other fuzzy evaluation fields. In addition to prospect theory, regret theory can also be applied in the PTOWD and field of fuzzy evaluation.\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nThere are two methodological topics that need to be highlighted. First, the proposed evaluation system contains seven indicators, which are relatively simple and easy to operate during calculation. We can further add or expand some other related indicators in the subsequent to make them more scientific and comprehensive, which may be a potential area for future research. Second, determining how the importance of an index is a classic issue in multi-attribute evaluation problems. Different weights should be assigned to different indicators according to actual situations. In this case, we have utilized a multiobjective programming method to determine the objective weights of indexes. Subjective methods by considering the people\u2019s subjective judgment, such as the social network trust model (Zeng et al., 2022) and BWM method (Zhang N. et al., 2022), can be considered regarding the allocation of weights in practical evaluation."
