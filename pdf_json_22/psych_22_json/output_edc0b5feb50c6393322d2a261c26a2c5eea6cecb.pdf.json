            "text": "Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease originating from the gastroduodenumwithout structural diseases (Wauters et al., 2020). FD is characterized by bothersome epigastric pain, epigastric burning, postprandial fullness or early satiety. FD is a highly prevalent disorder that affects \u223c5\u201320% of the world\u2019s population (Camilleri et al., 2005; Oshima and Miwa, 2015; Talley and Ford, 2016) and can significantly reduce the quality of life of patients, leading to increased medical costs. The pathophysiological mechanisms of FD are complex and may include impaired gastric regulation, delayed gastric emptying, excessive visceral sensitivity, low-grade mucosal inflammation, and eosinophilia in the duodenum (Masuy et al., 2019; Tziatzios et al., 2020). However, despite the continuous progress in research on the pathophysiological mechanism of FD, there are still no satisfactory methods for treating FD (Masuy et al., 2019).\nAt present, there is no available treatment that is effective for most patients with FD without significant side effects. The common treatment options for FD include Helicobacter pylori eradication, acid suppressive therapy, prokinetic agents, neuromodulators. Nondrug treatments such as acupuncture and psychological interventions may help to control symptoms, but there are still few relevant studies. FD is a heterogeneous disease in clinical symptoms and pathophysiology, which makes the development of effective treatment challenging (Masuy et al., 2019).\nThe brain gut axis is considered an important aetiological factor of FD (Drossman, 2016; Stanghellini et al., 2016). Psychological factors are an integral part of brain gut axis disorder, and psychological intervention may be a potential way to treat this complex disease (Masuy et al., 2019). Ameta-analysis of psychological interventions on IBS showed that psychological interventions were effective for IBS treatment (Black et al., 2020). However, the effects of psychological interventions on symptoms and psychology of FD remain unclear. Previous systematic reviews of psychological interventions for FD patients have failed to draw firm conclusions due to the limited number of studies (Soo et al., 2011). A meta-analysis evaluating the effect of psychological interventions on FD showed that psychological interventions were effective in improving global FD symptom scores. However, since Cochrane Library databases were not retrieved, the number of included studies was limited, and only changes in gastrointestinal symptom scores were analyzed, changes in overall symptoms and psychology were not effectively analyzed (Rodrigues et al., 2021). At the same time, one of the research objects included in the meta-analysis was duodenal ulcer patients, which was not consistent with the diagnosis of FD and should be excluded (Wilhelmsen et al., 1994).\nHence, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effects of psychological interventions on symptoms and psychology of FD. Meanwhile, the therapeutic effect of different psychological intervention subtypes on FD patients was evaluated."

We searched the literature by using MeSH terms and free-text words. The MeSH terms included dyspepsia, psychotherapy, psychodrama, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation therapy and hypnosis (Soo et al., 2011). There was no language limitation. The PubMed search strategy was available in the Supplementary Method 1. In addition, we manually searched the reference lists of included manuscripts and reviews.

The interpretation for this effect size: 0.2 represents a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect, and 0.8 a large effect. For dichotomous variables, risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were evaluated. The heterogeneity analysis was performed by Q statistic test, and we considered p < 0.1 and I2 > 50% to represent substantial heterogeneity. The meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model (DerSimonian\u2013 Laird method). Data were extracted from the intention-totreat analysis of the original article. If the outcomes in the original article were shown as the median and interquartile range, the mean and SD values were calculated according to the method of Wan et al. (2014). In studies that only provided the standard deviation (SD) of pretreatment and post-treatment, the SD of the difference between pretreatment and post-reatment was calculated according to the following formula: SD2 = (SD pretreatment) 2 + (SD posttreatment) 2 \u2212 (2R \u2217 SD pretreatment \u2217 SD posttreatment), and R was calculated from a included study reported in considerable detail (Cumpston et al., 2019). Sensitivity analysis was performed for outcomes assessed in \u22653 included studies by removing studies one by one to evaluate the impact of each study on the overall effect. The statistical analysis was mainly carried out by Review Manager 5.3 software. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. According to the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, testing for publication bias is not recommended as fewer than 10 studies were identified (Cumpston et al., 2019). Subgroup analysis was conducted to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. As psychological interventions included psychotherapy, psychodrama, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation therapy and hypnosis. Psychological intervention patterns were pre-defined variables that were considered in the subgroup analyses."

The analysis indicated that psychological interventions significantly reduce the anxiety levels compared with the control group (SMD= - 0.8, 95% CI: - 1.38,\u22120.22, p= 0.006) (Figure 6). Heterogeneity analysis showed significant heterogeneity between studies (p < 0.001, I2 = 90%). In the subgroup analysis, compared with the control group, psychotherapy was more likely to decrease anxiety levels, but the difference was not statistically significant [SMD = - 0.66, 95% CI (- 1.37, 0.06), p = 0.07]. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the subgroup analysis (p= 0.0006, I2 = 87%).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 827220\nPsychological Interventions on Depression A total of seven RCTs (Fan, 2006; Haag et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2008; Faramarzi et al., 2013; Orive et al., 2015; Zhuang, 2017; Xiong et al., 2019) with 933 patients (473 psychological interventions and 460 controls) reported a change in depression levels. Haag et al. (2007) examining relaxation or cognitive behavioral therapy, four RCTs (Fan, 2006; Jiang et al., 2008; Faramarzi et al., 2013; Orive et al., 2015) used psychotherapy as psychological interventions, one RCT (Zhuang, 2017) used relaxation therapy as psychological interventions, and one RCT (Xiong et al., 2019) used cognitive behavioral therapy as psychological interventions. Fan (2006) and Jiang et al. (2008) used the Hamilton Depression Scale (24 items) to assess the levels of anxiety; Haag et al. (2007) and Orive et al. (2015) used the Hospital depression Scale; Faramarzi et al. (2013) used a depression scale with a score ranging from 0 to 52, and Zhuang (2017) and Xiong et al. (2019) used the Self-rating Depression Scale with a cut-off score of 53. Compared with the control, psychological interventions were more likely to lower depression levels, and there was a\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 827220\nsignificant difference [SMD = - 1.11, 95% CI (- 1.62, - 0.61), p < 0.0001] (Figure 7). The results of the subgroup analysis showed that there was a significant effect of psychotherapy on lowering depression levels compared to the control group [SMD = - 1.16, 95% CI (- 1.89, - 0.43), p = 0.002], and there was significant heterogeneity between studies (p < 0.001, I2 = 94%)."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "To our knowledge, no meta-analysis has previously comprehensively assessed the effects of psychological interventions on symptoms and psychology of FD. The results of our meta-analysis showed that, compared with the control, there was a significantly beneficial effect of psychological interventions on symptom improvement, relieving gastrointestinal symptoms scores at follow up, relieving gastrointestinal symptoms scores at end of treatment, reducing anxiety and depression levels, with no significant improvement in the quality of life or psychological symptom scores. In the subgroup analysis, psychotherapy was more likely to symptom improvement, relieve gastrointestinal symptoms scores and decrease depression levels. These data thus lend support to psychological interventions as a therapeutic strategy that might be efficacious on symptoms and psychology of FD, but the effect appears to be limited to psychotherapy with fewer trials for other psychological interventions.\nPopulation-based studies have shown that the incidence of psychological disorders in patients with FD is significantly higher than that in non-FD patients (Li et al., 2002; Castillo et al., 2004; Locke et al., 2004; Koloski et al., 2005; Gathaiya et al., 2009). Symptoms of FD were associated with psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, but a causal relationship had not been established (Drossman et al., 1988). The pathophysiological studies of FD have shown that psychosocial factors may affect FD by regulating the processing and descending pathways of visceral signals in the brain (Van Oudenhove and Aziz, 2013). Previous meta-analyses of irritable bowel syndrome have shown that psychological interventions seem to be effective in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (Ford et al., 2014, 2019; Lee et al., 2014), and Ford et al. found that psychotropic drugs may be an effective treatment for FD (Ford\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 827220\net al., 2017). However, there are still few studies on the effect of psychological interventions on FD.\nIn this meta-analysis, psychological interventions included psychotherapy, psychodrama, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation therapy and hypnosis. Psychological interventions refer to any psychotherapeutic method designed to change a person\u2019s cognition, perception, or behavior (Shorey et al., 2021). Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on how maladaptive thoughts and behaviors occur (Soo et al., 2011). psychodynamicinterpersonal psychotherapy pays more attention to the relationship between therapist and patient. This method emphasizes that therapists and patients form a strong cooperative work alliance (Hamilton et al., 2000). The purpose of cognitive behavioral therapy is to improve the quality of life by changing patients\u2019 thoughts or thinking patterns and behaviors (Fordham et al., 2021). Relaxation therapy is to make patients experience the physical and mental pleasure brought by relaxation, so as to improve the psychological and physiological dysfunction caused by tension. Hypnotherapy is the use of hypnosis to treat patients in order to improve their condition. Although the effect appears to be limited to psychotherapy with fewer trials for other psychological interventions, the effect of other psychological interventions cannot be ignored. Calvert et al. found that hypnotherapy was highly effective in the management of FD (Calvert et al., 2002), and Haug et al. found that the cognitive psychotherapy group significantly reduced the symptoms of dyspepsia compared to the control group (Haug et al., 1994). Bates et al. found that pain intensity was significantly lower in the relaxation group than in the control group (Bates et al., 1988). Moreover, the studies included in our meta-analysis did not compare multiple psychological interventions, so it was not possible to compare the effects of various psychological interventions on functional dyspepsia. In\nclinical practice, the choice of psychological interventions needs to be comprehensively considered.\nPrevious reviews have assessed the effects of psychological interventions on FD. Popa et al. performed a review of 4 articles evaluating the efficacy of hypnotherapy in the treatment of FD (Popa et al., 2019). However, the patients in two of the articles were not explicitly diagnosed with FD. Soo et al. assessed the efficacy of psychological interventions on nonulcerative dyspepsia but identified only four studies that failed to perform a meta-analysis and demonstrated insufficient evidence to confirm the efficacy of psychological intervention nonulcerative dyspepsia (Soo et al., 2011). The results of Miller and Whorwell (2009) showed that hypnotherapy had considerable potential in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders and should be included in the medical care of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Rodrigues et al. did not retrieve Cochrane Library databases, and only analyzed the changes in gastrointestinal symptom scores, without a comprehensive analysis (Rodrigues et al., 2021). Compared with the previous reviews, our meta-analysis included a total of 14 studies, which can provide a more comprehensive explanation of the effects of psychological interventions on symptoms and psychology of FD.\nOur article had several limitations. First, there were differences in study populations, psychological intervention methods, and follow-up time among different included studies, which may affect the study results. We used SMDs and 95% CIs to evaluate continuous variables because the same outcome may have been evaluated differently. We also performed a subgroup analysis to find the source of heterogeneity. And considering the existence of heterogeneity, a random effects model was used. Second, although a total of 14 articles were included in our meta-analysis, a variety\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 827220\nof psychological interventions were included, resulting in a small number of patients receiving each intervention. Third, our meta-analysis showed considerable clinical and methodological heterogeneity, and we cannot exclude publication bias in these very small numbers of studies; therefore, the efficacy of psychological interventions was likely to be overestimated.\nIn conclusion, Psychological interventions may be effective in alleviating the symptoms and psychology of FD, but the effect appears to be limited to psychotherapy with fewer trials for other psychological interventions. More data from highquality RCTs are needed to confirm their use in the treatment of FD."
