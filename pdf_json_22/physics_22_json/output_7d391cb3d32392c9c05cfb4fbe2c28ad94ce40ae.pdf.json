    "abstractText": "The authors report the third-harmonic generation, nonlinear refraction, and nonlinear absorption in HgS quantum dot (QD) suspensions and films using the nanosecond and femtosecond pulses. High conversion efficiency (7 \u00d7 10\u22124) towards the third harmonic (TH) of the 900\u20131700 nm, 150 fs laser in the thin (70 nm) films containing HgS QDs deposited on the glass substrates is obtained. The authors analyze spectral dependencies of the TH, nonlinear refractive indices, and nonlinear absorption coefficients of QDs in the 500\u20131700 nm range and discuss the relation between the TH process and the low-order nonlinear optical properties of these quantum dots.",

            "text": "Numerous studies were reported about the routes to synthesize mercury sulfide (HgS) nanoparticles (NPs) and quantum dots (QDs) [1\u201313]. At the same time, the nonlinear optical (NLO) characterization of HgS QDs and NPs has rarely been reported [14\u201317]. The interest in these properties is related to the applications of HgS QDs and NPs as optical limiters, mode-lockers, and Q-switchers. In [14], the third-order nonlinear susceptibilities associated with intersubband transition were theoretically calculated for the ZnS/CdSe cylindrical quantum dot quantum well. The nonlinear optical properties of the CdSe/ZnS quantum dot quantum well have been reported in [15]. The third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility induced by the transition between E-1 (inside the well) and E-2 (outside the well) has been calculated for the third harmonic generation (THG) under the effective mass approximation and modified by the local field theory. THG has also been investigated in the ZnS/CdSe/ZnS nanoshell structures [16]. Numerical calculations showed that THG susceptibility has two peaks and depends on parameters such as the size and the kind of structure, the relaxation time, and the pump photon energy. Trigonal HgS, as a highly promising IR NLO material, was analyzed in [17]. Its polycrystalline powder sample exhibits a phase-matched second-harmonic generation response. In spite of the above theoretical studies, there is a lack of experimental work describing the nonlinear optical properties of HgS QDs, such as Kerr-related nonlinear refraction,\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1264. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12081264 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1264 2 of 16\nnonlinear absorption, as well as generation of third harmonic (TH).

The CA Z-scan scheme was calibrated using the known value of the nonlinear refractive index of carbon disulfide. The analysis of nonlinear refraction, saturable absorption (SA), reverse saturable absorption (RSA), and two-photon absorption (2PA) using long (nanosecond) pulses can define the spectral peculiarities of those processes in QDs, which could not be revealed using the short laser pulses. To determine the NLO response of our samples in the case of long PP, the authors used the 10 ns pulses from the Nd: YAG laser at the two wavelengths (1064 and 532 nm). A similar Z-scan scheme was used. Laser radiation was focused using a 300 mm focal length lens. We used the beam profiler with a CinCam CMOS Nano 1.001 camera (Axiom Optics, Los Angeles, CA, USA) to characterize the beam waist of the focused laser radiation. A beam profiler sensor was placed in the focal spot position. A set of ND filters was used to prevent the damage of the sensor. The position of the beam profiler was scanned along the direction of beam propagation and the minimum beam waist was recorded. The beam waist diameters were 80 \u00b5m and 60 \u00b5m (at half width of 1/e2 maximum of the spatial distribution at the focal plane) in the case of fundamental (1064 nm) and second-harmonic (532 nm) beams, respectively. The 0.2-mm-thick fused silica cell containing HgS QD colloidal suspension, or HgS QD thin film (70 nm) deposited in the glass substrate, was moved along the z-axis through the focal point using a translating stage controlled by a computer. The intensities of 1064 nm and 532 nm pulses used in the experiments did not exceed 9 \u00d7 108 W cm\u22122 and 7 \u00d7 108 W cm\u22122, respectively, to avoid the breakdown of the suspension and film. Special attention was paid to the CA Z-scans. To collect these scans, the 1-mm aperture allowing propagation of ~5% of radiation was fixed at a distance of 150 cm from the focal plane, behind which the photodiode was located. The scheme with CA allowed for the determination of the sign and value of the nonlinear refractive index of the QD-containing medium. The OA scheme allowed for the determination of the nonlinear absorption of the sample. The optical damage thresholds of suspensions and films using 10 ns, 532 nm and 10 ns, 1064 nm PP were determined to be 6 \u00d7 109 and 9 \u00d7 109 W cm\u22122, respectively. These values of optical damage were more than one order of magnitude larger than the intensities used during our measurements of the optical nonlinearities of samples. The standard fitting procedure was applied to the measured Z-scans, when commonly used relations [18] for determination of the \u03b3 and nonlinear absorption coefficients attributed to the 2PA (\u03b22PA), SA (\u03b2sat), and RSA (\u03b2RSA), as well as saturated intensity (Isat), were applied to fit our experimental data. The scheme for the measurements of TH yield was almost similar to the Z-scan scheme (Figure 1b). For these experiments, we used the thin film containing HgS QDs, similar to the one used during measurements of the nonlinear refraction and nonlinear absorption. The used parameters of the ORPHEUS-HP + PHAROS PH2 femtosecond laser (Light Conversion) were as follows: 150 fs pulse duration, 50 nJ pulse energy, 500 kHz pulse repetition rate. The wavelength of output radiation from the laser allowed for tuning in the range of 190\u20132500 nm, while THG was analyzed in the 900\u20131700 nm range of laser radiation. More details of THG experiments are described in Section 5."

The synthesized colloidal QDs with the first absorption peak at 1036 nm were applied for the preparation of thin films. In the typical synthesis, two solutions were prepared: solution A: 30 mg (0.11 mmol) of HgCl2 and 6 mL of dry oleylamine were placed in a round bottom flask with two necks under argon flow at room temperature and gradually heated to 100 \u25e6C for 1 h, and solution B: sulfur precursor stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mmol (0.032 g) of S in 10 mL of oleylamine\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1264 4 of 16\nunder Ar flow at 100 \u25e6C for 1 h. Then the solutions were cooled to 60 \u25e6C and 2 mL of sulfur precursor was rapidly injected by syringe into the solution A under argon flow. The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 \u25e6C for 15 min. After that, a quenching mixture consisted of 16 mL tetrachloroethylene (TCE), 3.1 mL (0.8 mmol) dodecanthiol, and 1.5 mL tri-n-octylphosphine was added to the reaction mixture and simultaneously cooled in the ice bath. 4 mL of methanol was added per 6 mL of the resulting solution and centrifuged to isolate the precipitate. The resulting precipitate was redispersed in 2 mL of TCE, and 2 mL of the acetonitrile was added to the resulting solution, which was again centrifuged. The precipitate was dried under Ar flow, redispersed in 0.5 mL of TCE, and filtered using 0.22 \u00b5m hydrophobic filter. 0.2 mL of this solution was diluted to 2 mL by adding TCE and characterized by using the UV-visible/NIR spectrophotometer (JASCO V-770, Los Angeles, CA, USA). The thin films were prepared by layer-by-layer deposition using the dip-coating on a 0.15 mm-thick glass substrate. The ligand shell exchange by 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) has been done using 1:1:100 EDT/HCl/2-propanol solution [20]. The glass substrate was withdrawn at a speed of 18 mm/min. Excess of exchanging reagent was removed by washing the thin films in 2-propanol. The procedure was repeated 5 to 20 times in order to obtain films with thicknesses of ~70 nm. The position of the first absorption peak maximum was shifted toward the longer wavelength range in the film after ligand exchange. In the case of EDT, it was 16 nm red shifted towards 1051 nm in the case of the film. The optical density of the HgS QD suspension contained in 1 mm-thick silica glass cell is shown in Figure 2a for the near IR range.

XPS measurements (PHOIBOS 150 MCD,\nSPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH, Berlin, Germany) were employed using the Mg Ka radiation (1253.6 eV).

The sulfur is only one chemical element that could be oxi-\ndized in HgS, while the mercury is already in the highest oxidation state (Hg2+).

Including all error sources, the uncertainty in the measured values was estimated to be 30%, which is typical for experimental errors during Z-scan measurements. The fitting of OA Z-scans determined the \u03b2sat of the film in the case of 150 fs PP [\u03b2sat = \u2212(2 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22127 cm W\u22121) in the case of 500 nm PP]. This parameter was varied between \u22120.8 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm W\u22121 (at \u03bb = 700 nm) and \u22122 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm W\u22121 (at \u03bb = 500 nm), so the bleaching significantly depended on the wavelength of PP. The corresponding saturation intensity was determined to be Isat \u2248 8 \u00d7 1010 W cm\u22122 in the case of 500 nm PP. One can see that the thin film containing HgS QDs demonstrates a relatively low value of saturated intensity. The low-Isat saturable absorbers may allow the formation of the lowpower femtosecond laser sources. The saturation intensity of light at which the extinction coefficient is reduced by a factor of 2 is an important parameter of such lasers. SA does not directly follow the spectral absorption dependence since the former process depends on different factors related to the structure of energy levels of the studied material. Meanwhile, one can admit that \u03b2sat increased with the steady growth of the linear absorption in the visible range. Figure 5a shows the CA Z-scan of film using 1100 nm, 20 nJ, and 150 fs pulses at 500 kHz repetition rate. The fitting of the CA Z-scan (Figure 5a, red solid curve) helped determine the nonlinear refractive index of the studied film. The discrepancy between the fittings and experimental CA and OA curves shown in this and other figures can be attributed to some asymmetric (slightly elliptical) shape of the used beam in the focal area (see the discrepancy in the case of the negative and positive values of z). The film demonstrated self-defocusing along the whole range of studied pulse energies variations (0.5\u201330 nJ). The negative nonlinear refraction was observed in a broad spectral range (500\u20131300 nm; Figure 5b, blue filled squares).

In the case of the kinetic model, the absorption coefficient can be presented as \u03b1(z) = \u03b10/(1 + I(z)/Isat), where I(z) is the variable intensity of laser pulses. This model showed the best fit with our experimental data. The relations of this model determined the saturated intensity (Isat = 7 \u00d7 108 W cm\u22122 in the case of 10 ns, 1064 nm PP and Isat = 2 \u00d7 108 W cm\u22122 in the case of 10 ns, 532 nm PP). The corresponding negative nonlinear absorption coefficient in the case of 1064 nm pulses was calculated to be \u03b2sat = \u22124 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm W\u22121. This parameter did not change with the growth of laser intensity in the range of 0.02 and 0.16 mJ energies of the 1064 nm PP. The application of 0.2 mJ pulses led to the uncertainties in the determination of \u03b2sat due to the growing influence of the RSA dominating at larger energies of PP in the OA Z-scans (Figure 6a). 2PA or RSA are the commonly reported mechanisms of the nonlinear absorption of QDs. Notice that, in most cases, SA follows by RSA. HgS QD suspension did not show any absorption bands in the region of the twice shorter wavelength than the wavelength of the PP (1064 nm). Considering the fact that we did not see the excitonic band attributed to QDs at the lower wavelengths of PP, one can assume that 2PA of 1064 nm pulses hardly can be considered as an alternative to the RSA mechanism for the explanation of the growth of positive nonlinear absorption observed in our studies. The fitting of the OA Z-scan presented in Figure 6a (brown filled triangles) in the case when the RSA entirely dominates over the SA determined \u03b2RSA at \u03bb = 1064 nm to be 1 \u00d7 10\u22128 cm W\u22121. The possibility of the dynamic scattering of the nanosecond PP by QDs films has recently been studied using the 10 ns pulses [24]. Those studies did not observe the nonlinear scattering in the case of 532 nm probe pulses. The authors analyzed the possibility of dynamic scattering of the probe pulses in colloidal HgS QDs by installing the additional photodiode out of the optical axis of beam propagation. These measurements showed the pattern of very weak and unchanged scattering during the propagation of our sample (0.2 mm-thick cell filled in with QD suspension) through the focal plane of the focusing lens while probing the whole range of used intensities of laser pulses. No valley was observed during our OA Z-scans as well, which point out the insignificance of the scattering process in the studied suspensions. The same can be said about films. Thus, the nonlinear scattering cannot be considered as the mechanism of the decrease of normalized transmittance at the larger intensities of 532 nm probe pulses. The same conclusion was obtained in the case of a twice-as-long wavelength of the probe pulses. This conclusion may also be applied to the measurements in the case of femtosecond PP. CA Z-scan studies were also performed using different energies of the probe pulses. At \u03bb = 1064 nm, the nonlinear refraction was observed only in the case of relatively strong laser pulses. Figure 6b shows the CA Z-scan in the case of 0.85 mJ PP, though the self-defocusing was observed at smaller energies of laser pulses. The fitting of this curve determined \u03b3 at \u03bb = 1064 nm (\u22121 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm2 W\u22121). Similar fitting of the CA Z-scan using 532 nm showed that the self-defocusing at this wavelength is significantly stronger (Figure 6d, \u22126 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm2 W\u22121) compared with the case of the 1064 nm pulses. One can see that the approximately similar peak-to-valley values shown in these two CA curves (Figure 6b,d) were obtained using the 0.85 and 0.005 mJ pulses. To confirm that the NLO properties are purely related with the HgS QDs, the main solvent (TCE) was analyzed at two wavelengths (532 and 1064 nm) of probe radiation using a similar procedure of Z-scan. No NLO response was observed during this test study, which indicated that the observed processes were derived entirely from the HgS QDs. Notice the absence of the thermal lens building in the pure TCE representing the main liquid component of the studied suspension. Similarly, the self-defocusing observed in these studies of the colloidal suspension of the HgS QDs cannot be attributed to the thermal lens building due to the low pulse repetition rate (10 Hz). The same conclusion was made during similar studies of pure TCE using femtosecond pulses.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1264 10 of 16\nIn the case of relatively long pulses, the molecular Kerr-related nonlinearities can prevail over electronic Kerr-related processes. Commonly, the former refractive nonlinearities demonstrate the self-defocusing properties. The prevalence of the molecular nonlinearities related to the reoriented mechanisms over the electronic nonlinearity may play an important role in the picosecond, and especially, in the nanosecond timescale. Thus, the larger values of the \u03b3 of studied samples in the case of nanosecond PP with regard to the 150 fs pulses could be expected. Notice that we probed the films and suspensions possessing approximately similar optical densities. Meanwhile, the self-defocusing in the film probed by femtosecond pulses was stronger than the one in the colloidal suspension probed by nanosecond pulses. This observation may reveal the assumption that the same amount of QDs being combined at a smaller volume (70 nm thin film) can enhance the NLO processes due to the growing influence of the combined local field effect compared with the same amount of QDs distributed along the much wider region (0.2 mm). To prove this assumption, the authors performed similar studies of films using the 10 ns pulses. Figure 7 shows the corresponding Z-scans of HgS QD film using the 1064 (Figure 7a) and 532 nm (Figure 7b) pulses. A comparison of the OA Z-scans in the case of the longer-wavelength femtosecond pulses (Figure 4a) and nanosecond pulses (Figure 7a) showed the stronger NLO response in the latter case. Actually, there was a very weak SA in the case of 1000 nm, 150 fs pulses. As for the visible (532 nm) region, approximately the same SA was observed in the case of 150 fs and 10 ns pulses, in spite of a large difference in the applied intensities of PP. Meanwhile, no RSA was registered in the film at both wavelengths (Figure 7) contrary to the suspension (Figure 6a,c). The NLO optical parameters of film were determined to be the \u03b2sat = \u22124 \u00d7 10\u22128 and \u03b2sat = \u22129 \u00d7 10\u22128 cm W\u22121, as well as \u03b3 = \u22123 \u00d7 10\u221213 and \u03b3 = \u22122 \u00d7 10\u221212 cm2 W\u22121 at \u03bb = 1064 nm and \u03bb = 532 nm, respectively. One can see that these values measured in the film exceed those measured in the 0.2 mmthick cells filled in by the HgS QD colloidal suspension, which proved our assumption regarding the prevailing NLO properties of the thin films with regard to the sparsely distributed QDs of the same density.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 16\nnonlinearities related to the reoriented mechanisms over the electronic nonlinearity may\nplay an important role in the picosecond, and especially, in the nanosecond timescale.\nThus, the larger values of the \u03b3 of studied samples in the case of nanosecond PP with\nregard to the 150 fs pulses could be expected.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the study of the NLO properties of semiconductor QDs with average sizes of less than 4 nm. The main advantages of such NLO media are high optical uniformity of the colloidal solutions and films, as well as size-dependent spectral and luminescent properties related with the confinement effect. The dimensional dependence of the transition energy in absorption and luminescence opens up possibilities for achieving resonances, the use of which can reduce the threshold for the observation of the optical nonlinearities. In the case of low-order harmonic generation, two perspectives can be considered: on one hand, it can be useful in the search for new efficient materials that will act as nonlinear media in THG and higher-order processes. On other hand, this technique is suitable as a diagnostic tool to characterize the species presented in laser-induced plasmas. Particularly, the shape of the harmonic distribution can reveal the presence of some elements incorporated in the ablating targets. Such an opportunity has been demonstrated using the ablation of the stainless-steel nozzle of gas jet during the studies of HHG in argon gas [27]. Without the ablating nozzle by picosecond pulses, the harmonic spectrum represented the ordinary spectrum of gradually decreasing harmonics from the Ar gas jet. The ablation of the nozzle led to an appearance of the components of stainless-steel ablation in the axis of the driving beam propagation. These components drastically changed the HHG spectrum. The harmonics from H13 to H25 generated in the mixture of gas and plasma were five times stronger than those generated in the pure argon gas. The most intriguing pattern was observed in the area of harmonic cutoff. It was shown that the 27th harmonic almost disappeared compared to the neighboring ones. Meanwhile, the following harmonic, H29, was notably stronger that H25, which is an unusual case. Stainless steel contains a number of constituents that define its structure, hardness, and other physical and chemical properties. It was shown that one of the important constituents was the chromium (12%). The role of Cr in the harmonic spectrum generated in stainless steel plasma has been studied earlier using pure Cr and pure Fe as the targets for HHG experiments [28]. The former plasma has shown a considerable enhancement of the intensity of the 29th harmonic. Thus, the abovementioned studies have demonstrated that the increase of the intensity of the 29th harmonic, in the case of ablated stainless steel, was associated with the presence of the chromium in the ablating sample. The search for methods to ensure a stable concentration of clusters in the plasma will increase the output of low- and high-order harmonics. Stable conditions of the QDcontaining plasma will allow an investigation of the influence of various properties, in particular plasmon and exciton resonances, on the efficiency of HHG. Additionally, THG can be used to study the purely electronic hyperpolarizability of materials. No other mechanism but the non-resonant electron cloud distortion can respond rapidly enough to produce a nonlinear polarization oscillating at the third harmonic. While the effect has been investigated in liquids and solids, the use of thin films comprising QDs and NPs has proved particularly interesting. In spite of the relatively low number of active media in ultrathin films, THG efficiency can become relatively high (of the order of 0.01%). Studies of the nonlinear refraction and absorption in other mercury-contained QDs (HgTe, HgSe) have shown that those species demonstrate smaller nonlinear refractive indices and nonlinear absorption coefficients compared with the HgS QDs [20,29]. Moreover, HgS QDs have demonstrated the efficient THG, which was not reported during the studies of HgTe and HgSe QDs."

The NLO parameters of this\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1264 15 of 16\nsuspension at 1064 nm were smaller compared with the case of 532 nm probe pulses. The negative nonlinear refraction of HgS QDs was attributed to the Kerr effect in the case of 532 nm and 1064 nm, 10 ns probe pulses, as well as femtosecond pulses. The thin film containing HgS QDs was studied using the tunable femtosecond laser in the range of 500 to1500 nm. We have shown that these QD-contained films possess strong saturable absorption and negative nonlinear refraction in the case of 400 nm, 150 fs probe pulses. The spectral and intensity variations of saturable absorption and nonlinear refraction of the studied thin films were discussed. The measurements of saturable absorption have shown that these films containing HgS QDs possess the low values of saturated intensity, which is useful for the formation of the low-power femtosecond laser sources. Finally, the authors compared the NLO parameters of these films measured by femtosecond and nanosecond pulses. The authors demonstrated a high conversion efficiency towards the third harmonic of the 900\u20131700 nm, 150 fs laser in the thin (70 nm) film containing QDs deposited on the glass substrates. The ratio of TH conversion efficiencies in the films and glasses of the same thickness was estimated to be >106. The intensity, polarization, and spectral dependencies of this process in HgS QD thin film have been analyzed. The third harmonic conversion efficiency was measured to be 7 \u00d7 10\u22124. The authors have discussed the relation between the TH process and the low-order NLO properties of these quantum dots, as well as the potential applications of these QDs for HHG.\nAuthor Contributions: V.V.K.: investigation.
