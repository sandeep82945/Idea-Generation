            "text": "Acinetobacter baumannii is a critical emerging Gram-negative pathogen, now considered by the WHO and CDC as a health priority for research and development (R&D).1 A. baumannii exploits diverse mechanisms to elude the action of antibiotics, including the use of efflux pumps to extrude a myriad of xenobiotics from within the bacteria.2,3 In A. baumannii, like in many other Gram-negative bacteria, efflux pumps belonging to the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) superfamily play a clinically relevant role in antibiotic resistance.4 Although at least nine have been described for A. baumannii, the AdeABC, AdeFGH and AdeIJK tripartite systems have been primarily linked to loss of antibiotic susceptibility.4,5\nThe fundamental role of RND efflux pumps in reducing antibiotic susceptibility in Gram-negative bacteria has prompted\ngreat interest in developing efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) over the last 15 years. Primary examples of such discovered and characterized EPIs targeting Gram-negative RND pumps include the peptidomimetic PA\u03b2N,6\u20138 pyranopyridines of the MBX series9\u201311 and the pyridopyrimidine D13-9001.12 In addition to these EPIs, we recently described and characterized a new class of EPIs, known as pyridylpiperazines (PyrPips),13,14 that boost antibiotic activity in Escherichia coli by binding a novel allosteric pocket in the transmembrane region of AcrB and inhibiting the activity of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump.\nA. baumannii is known to have low membrane permeability, driven by a combination of porins and efficient efflux pumps that hamper antibiotic activity.15 In A. baumannii, the main efflux pumps (i.e. AdeB, AdeG and AdeJ) have an overall low degree of amino acid sequence conservation when compared with AcrB of\n1 of 9\nJAC Antimicrob Resist https://doi.org/10.1093/jacamr/dlad112\nJACAntimicrobial Resistance\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jacam r/article/5/5/dlad112/7328969 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 11 January 2024\nE. coli (49%, 40% and 57%, respectively); however, the residues around our previously described PyrPip inhibitor-binding site are highly conserved. In this work, we sought to investigate whether PyrPip could act as an EPI of A. baumannii RND pumps. Validation and characterization of PyrPips\u2019 target was achieved by deploying comparative structural modelling and docking, structure-activity relationship studies and molecular genetics approaches. We show that two enhanced EPIs are capable of rescuing the activity of different antibiotic classes in A. baumannii. We report that although our enhanced EPIs act primarily on AdeJ and to a lesser extent on AdeG and AdeB, further efforts are required to improve our knowledge behind the biology of A. baumannii efflux pumps, leading to more potent PyrPip EPIs to help combat antimicrobial resistance mediated by efflux pumps."

These bacterial suspensions were transferred to a 96-well flat-bottomed microtitre plate (Falcon, France), and a gradient of antibiotics of interest was added by serial dilutions. Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for up to 20 h, and bacterial viability was evaluated using the resazurin reduction assay and measured by fluorescence (POLARstar Omega, BMG Labtech: Ex: 530 nm, Em: 590 nm).

The recombinant plasmids were constructed using an NEBuilder assembly kit and the Q5-HF polymerase (NEB, France). The acrR-PacrA DNA fragment was PCR amplified from E. coli \u0394acrAB genomic DNA. The adeABC and adeIJK operons were PCR amplified from the genome of A. baumannii AB5075, and adeFGH from A. baumannii ATCC17978. Each assembly mix was transformed into E. coli UCC/pir+ (Lucigen, UK) by electroporation, and kanamycin-resistant clones were selected. Correct plasmid constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. The generated plasmids were designated pJC1 (PacrA-adeIJK), pJC2 (PacrA-adeABC) and pJC3 (PacrA-adeFGH), and introduced into E. coli \u0394acrAB by electroporation, selecting for kanamycin resistance. Correct plasmid integration at the acrR\nlocus was assessed by PCR. To avoid plasmid excision in the absence of kanamycin, we then used Red-recombineering to exchange the oriR6K-KmR region with a gentamicin cassette and thus stabilize each chromosomal construct.\nGeneration of adeJ efflux pump deletions in A. baumannii To delete adeJ in A. baumannii ATCC17978, an allelic exchange strategy based on the pMo130 suicide vector was used as described by Amin et al.18 Briefly, 0.8 kb DNA fragments located up/downstream of the targeted gene were PCR amplified and cloned into pMo130 using an NEBbuilder assembly kit (NEB). Following confirmation of the correct plasmid assembly by Sanger sequencing, the suicide plasmid was transformed into A. baumannii ATCC17978 by electroporation. Single crossover events were selected on kanamycin; upon growth in LB + sucrose 15%, double-crossover kanamycin-sensitive strains were screened in which adeJ knockout was assessed by PCR. Subsequent WGS (microbesNG, Birmingham, UK) confirmed the anticipated genome sequence.\nGeneration of A. baumannii adeJ point mutants Point mutations in adeJ were introduced into the A. baumannii ATCC17978 chromosome using the allelic exchange method described previously18 and above. Briefly, a \u223c1 kb DNA fragment centred on the adeJ targeted nucleotide was cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO (Fisher Scientific). The resulting plasmid was then used as a template for sitedirected mutagenesis with mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (Table S2) and Q5-polymerase (NEB). DNA fragments confirmed to carry the desired adeJ mutations were then subcloned into pMo130, and ATCC17978 was electrotransformed with the resulting plasmid. The correct allelic exchange was assessed by sequencing a PCR amplicon of the targeted region, followed by WGS (microbesNG, Birmingham, UK)."

The inner membrane components of these tripartite pumps share moderate overall amino acid similarities when compared with AcrB of E. coli; however, the region of the identified PyrPip binding pocket remains highly conserved (Figure 1). The E. coli AcrB-PyrPip co-structure showed that PyrPip binding was associated with significant changes to the TM region,13 thus similar structural changes could be expected in the Ade proteins. Although the apo-structures of AdeB and AdeJ have been recently solved,25,26 these structures could not be used for chemical docking as they do not account for the likely required TM movement. Therefore as an initial approach to evaluate whether AdeB, AdeG and AdeJ could accommodate PyrPip EPIs, structural models of each Ade pump were generated based on the published AcrB L-protomer-BDM88885 co-structure (apo structure).13 Molecular docking was then used to evaluate the binding poses of the BDM88855 EPI in each of these models. The three models confirmed a high level of three-dimensional\nstructural identity with AcrB, with only a few amino acid substitutions (Figure 1) and no evidence of obvious steric hindrance or loss of essential binding interactions. Together, the analysis suggested that PyrPips could inhibit these pumps in A. baumannii."

Medicinal chemistry optimization of BDM73185 to more potent PyrPip analogues against E. coli AcrB13 provided an extended PyrPip chemical library (>200 compounds) that was also evaluated in A. baumannii. This library was assessed in dose\u2013response against A. baumannii in the presence of sub-MIC concentrations of efflux pump substrate antibiotics (chloramphenicol: 50 mg/L; fusidic acid: 50 mg/L; novobiocin: 5 mg/L; erythromycin: 2.5 mg/ L; azithromycin: 0.15 mg/L; and ciprofloxacin: 0.2 mg/L). Globally, this phenotypic screen clearly showed a disconnect between PyrPip potency observed in E. coli compared with that observed in A. baumannii. Overall, far fewer PyrPips were found to potentiate antibiotic activity, additionally encompassed by a lower potency. This finding suggested that despite no obvious difference in the PyrPip binding pocket of the Ade pumps, the structure-activity relationships governing the boosting of antibiotic activity were different to those established for E. coli AcrB.\nDespite the overall inferior activity of PyrPips in A. baumannii, a total of 97 compounds were identified to potentiate the activity of at least one antibiotic by at least one dilution (2-fold), whereas 33 had activity to more than one antibiotic by at least two dilutions (4-fold). In general, we observed a high frequency of antibiotic boosting for fusidic acid, novobiocin and erythromycin, but to a lesser extent for azithromycin and ciprofloxacin.\nFigure 1.

The three most potent EPIs from the quinoline series were close analogues with meta- (compound 1), ortho- (compound 2) and para(compound 3) benzylamine at position 6 of the quinoline ring (Table 1). A butanediamine substituent (compound 4) also allowed for boosting of antibiotic activity, though this compound was less potent. Regarding the pyridine series, three compounds (compounds 6\u20138) bearing an ester linker in position 5 of the pyridine ring were able to boost fusidic acid and novobiocin, though the most potent ester (compound 8) also showed intrinsic antibacterial activity of 62 \u00b5M. The two most potent boosters in this series were analogues bearing an ethynylphenyl moiety with either an ethylamine chain in the meta- (compound 9) or para- (compound 10) position. The initial chemical library did not contain the ortho-substituted ethylamine analogue, and so it was synthesized (compound 11), and found to be 3- to 6-fold more potent at boosting novobiocin activity (EC90 = 10 \u00b5M) than analogues 9 (EC90 = 31 \u00b5M) and 10 (EC90 = 62 \u00b5M).\nA common characteristic among the most potent boosters, BDM91531 (compound 1) and BDM91892 (compound 11), is that they share a primary amine moiety. Replacing this group with another hydrogen bond-donating group, such as an alcohol, led to inactive compounds (compound 5, EC90 \u2265 125 \u00b5M; compound 12, EC90 > 62 \u00b5M), suggesting that the basic amine could interact with one of the acidic residues of the binding pocket via a salt bridge. In E. coli, both BDM91531 and BDM91892 were validated to inhibit AcrB (EC90 = 0.24 and 1.5 \u00b5M, respectively) as PyrPip resistance mutations (S446P or A450P substitution in AcrB)13 prevented antibiotic boosting activity of both compounds (EC90 = 32 \u00b5M) (Table S3).\nPyrPips inhibit A. baumannii RND pumps heterologously expressed in E. coli Because A. baumannii expresses multiple RND efflux pumps, we studied the antibiotic boosting activity of PyrPips BDM91531\n(compound 1) and BDM91892 (compound 11) on individual A. baumannii RND pumps using a heterologous expression system in E. coli lacking AcrAB. The adeABC, adeFGH or adeIJK operons were cloned into the E. coli \u0394acrAB chromosome under the native promoter of acrA, to mediate a natural level of protein expression to PyrPip inhibition (pump overexpression could reduce EPI potency due to target overexpression). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses confirmed that all three pumps were expressed at a comparable level in the recombinant strains (Table S4) although we recognize that this does not guarantee the correct and or expected assembly of the tripartite pumps in the E. coli membranes. Nonetheless, whereas expression of adeABC or adeFGH had no obvious impact on the growth rate, the adeIJK recombinant strain showed a moderate growth defect (Figure S1), similar to that previously reported.5,27,28\nInitially, the impact of Ade efflux pump expression in E. coli \u0394acrAB was determined by susceptibility to a selected panel of antibiotics (Table 2). Overall, heterologous expression of adeABC had limited impact on antibiotic susceptibility, which may be due to inefficiencies in AdeABC pump assembly in E. coli or to intrinsic differences in E. coli and A. baumannii cell wall architecture preventing proper functioning of this specific RND pump. This lack of AdeABC-related phenotype prevented the analysis of PyrPip inhibition on this RND pump. On the other hand, expression of adeFGH increased resistance to chloramphenicol and oxacillin (as well as the detergent SDS), whereas expression of adeIJK increased resistance to fusidic acid, novobiocin and erythromycin. These antibiotic profiles are largely in agreement with previous studies where these pumps were overexpressed, though the magnitude of resistance differs probably due to differences in expression level.29,30\nNext, we challenged E. coli \u0394acrAB and recombinant strains expressing A. baumannii RND efflux pumps in the presence of 40 \u00b5M BDM91531, BDM91892 or PA\u03b2N (Table 2). Results showed that all three molecules were able to increase antibiotic susceptibility. In particular, chloramphenicol and oxacillin resistance\u2014 mediated by adeFGH expression\u2014was affected. Moreover, resistance to fusidic acid, novobiocin and erythromycin\u2014mediated by\nBDM91892 11\nNH2\nTFA >62 10\n12\nOH\n>62 > 62\nBold values indicate boosting by at least 4-fold.

In all cases, PyrPips were also able to decrease SDS resistance mediated by adeFGH and adeIJK expression. As adeABC expression did not give a clear resistance phenotype, it was not possible to evaluate the efficacy of the EPIs on this pump. Together, these data strongly support that both BDM91531 and BDM91892 can inhibit the activity of AdeFGH and AdeIJK when expressed in E. coli."

Results largely reproduced the antibiotic boosting observed during the PyrPips\u2019 screening (i.e. chloramphenicol, novobiocin, erythromycin and fusidic acid), but also showed boosting of linezolid, aztreonam and trimethoprim (and piperacillin and oxacillin by BDM91531 only); however, no boosting was observed for levofloxacin, amikacin, gentamicin, cefepime and streptomycin by any of the inhibitors (Figure 2).

Data showed that A. baumannii primarily expresses adeIJK [average cycle threshold (Ct) = 19], followed by adeABC and adeFGH at much lower levels (average Ct = 24.35 and 26.40, respectively) (Table S4). Although transcriptional analysis does not fully reflect protein production levels, results are in line with previous data establishing AdeIJK as the predominant RND pump in A. baumannii strains.5\nStructure-activity relationship data on PyrPips showed the primary amine moiety of BDM91531 and BDM91892 to be beneficial for potency. In fact, recent studies on E. coli AcrB showed that two acidic residues at the entrance of the PyrPip binding pocket in AcrB (E947 and D951) are crucial for PyrPip activity.14 Indeed, substitutions of any of these residues in AcrB led to a shift in potency for compounds BDM91531 and BDM91892, whereas PA\u03b2N activity was unaffected (Table S3). A. baumannii AdeJ also contains acidic residues at the equivalent positions (E959 and E963) (Figure 1). In the absence of an Ade-PyrPip co-structure or molecular dynamics data, in silico docking studies of BDM91531 and BDM91892 into the modelled AdeJ were deployed to evaluate PyrPip binding. The results showed that both EPIs could fit into the PyrPip binding pocket of AdeJ while making potential polar interactions between the PyrPip primary amine and the AdeJ acidic residues, E959 and E963. In addition to conservation of interactions with TM4 and TM5, a partial perpendicular \u03c0-stacking was also observed with AdeJ residue F960. Free energy (\u0394G) calculations for each EPI suggested BDM91531 to have greater binding affinity to AdeJ compared with BDM91892 (DG\u25e6= \u22129.8 and \u22126.6 kcal/mol, respectively; Figure 2d).Ta bl e 2.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that A. baumannii AdeJE959Q-E963Q was more resistant to the antibiotic-boosting impact of BDM91531 (particularly with novobiocin and fusidic acid) but not to BDM91892 or PA\u03b2N (all at 40 \u00b5M) (Figure 2a). In addition, checkerboard assays were used to further determine synergy between EPI and novobiocin (Figure 3) or fusidic acid (Figure S2). Our data were corroboration that compared with A. baumannii WT strain, the AdeJE959Q-E963Q mutant was more resistant to BDM91531-mediated boosting for novobiocin (Figure 2) and partially resistant to the boosting for fusidic acid (Figure S2). In contrast, BDM91892 and PA\u03b2N remained equally active (Figures S2 and 3). The observation that BDM91892 remained active in the mutant strain suggests that the AdeJ E959 and E963 residues do not play a major role in governing its activity, which agrees with its lower docking score (Figure 2d and Figure S2). As a contol, checkerboard assays were performed with A. baumannii lacking AdeJ (\u0394adeJ) further confirming the role of this pump in novobiocin and fusidic acid efflux (Figure S2) and, thus, supporting that AdeJ is a primary target of PyrPips."

            "text": "PyrPips have been demonstrated to be effective EPIs in E. coli, targeting an allosteric pocket in the TM region of AcrB.13,14 Based on the similarity of the residues lining the PyrPip binding pocket between E. coli AcrB and A. baumannii AdeB, AdeG and AdeJ pumps, we tested PyrPips for boosting antibiotic activity in A. baumannii. The combined results reveal that some PyrPips are indeed capable of inhibiting A. baumannii RND efflux pumps, particularly AdeG and AdeJ, as shown in the heterologous expression system in E. coli. Moreover, our data also show that in A. baumannii ATCC17978 AdeJ was the likely target responsible for the antibiotic-boosting phenotype. In particular, BDM91531 was able to boost novobiocin activity in A. baumannii by interacting with AdeJ acidic residues E959 and E963 in the PyrPip binding pocket. Overall, the data indicate that PyrPips\u2019 activity is significantly less potent in A. baumannii than in E. coli, and that the observed structure-activity relationships of these molecules is not fully conserved. Likely contributing factors are differences in PyrPip penetration into A. baumannii, RND efflux pump expression levels, and the unstudied contribution of amino acid variations between AcrB and Ade pumps.\nThe main aim of this work was to establish a rational foundation towards a deeper understanding of how to improve and implement PyrPip EPIs against the current clinically relevant A. baumannii bacterium. We present systematic and strong evidence that PyrPip molecules can inhibit A. baumannii RND efflux pumps and that their co-exposure with antibiotics allows for synergistic antibiotic activity. Future efforts in unveiling the full mechanism of action behind PyrPips in A. baumannii will aim to develop more active inhibitors. Therefore, our current basic work provides an attractive strategy\u2014currently in line with the WHO general agenda\u2014to increase R&D to mitigate antimicrobial resistance driven by efflux pumps."
