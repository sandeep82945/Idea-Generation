Introduction Among all mental diseases, schizophrenia (OMIM: #181500, SCZ) is one of the most severe and debilitating psychiatric disorders with an approximate worldwide prevalence of 1%(1). Although the etiology of SCZ is still unknown, the extracted results from family, twins, and adaption studies clari ed the high heritability of SCZ(2).\nSimilar to other multifactorial diseases, several complicated genetic factors and biological mechanisms incorporate into the manifestation of SCZ. Across all biomarkers that have been studied in SCZ, defects in monoamine neurotransmitters and their pathways have long been one of the most favorable explanations for the pathophysiology of SCZ(3). serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is the main monoamine neurotransmitter of the central nervous system which participated in several brain functions including cognition, mood, motor function, and behavior (4, 5) as well as a wide range of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety(6), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (7), depression(8), suicidal attempt(9), and schizophrenia(10). The action mechanism of 5-HT on the nervous system is modulated by 5-HT receptors located in the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron and leads to developmental and cell migration processes(11).\nPage 3/11\nAmong fourteen subtypes of 5-HT receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (5-HTR2A) is belonged to the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) superfamily which is widely expressed in various neocortex regions including the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus(12). According to previous studies, it has been demonstrated that 5-HTR2A expression signi cantly decreased in schizophrenic patients\u2019 brain regions like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus(13).\n5-HTR2A is a ~ 66kb gene which is located in 13q14-q21 and contains three exons(14). Among more than 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in 5-HTR2A, rs6311 (A-1438G) and rs6313 (T102C) are the two most evaluated SNPs which respectively posit in the promoter region and exon 1 of 5-HTR2A. Up to now, a number of studies, explore the association of rs6311 and rs6313 with psychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder (MDD) (15), OCD, eating disorder(16), alcohol and heroin abuse(17), suicidal behavior(18), autism(19), and SCZ(20) in different populations. However, in the case of SCZ, the obtained results are seemed to be inconsistent among different populations. For instance, although there was a signi cant association between SCZ and rs6311 in India(21) and Northern Spain(22), no association was observed between rs6311 and SCZ in the Korean population(23). Besides, in both HanChinese(24) and Spanish populations(25), rs6313 was signi cantly associated with SCZ, however, this nding was not replicated in Turkish schizophrenic patients(26). So, supposedly, more association studies in various populations are required to achieve a clear understanding of the association between SCZ and rs6313 and rs6311.\nOn the other aspect, it has been well-established that rs6311 and rs6313 are completely in Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) with Logarithm of Odds (LOD) value of around 82 (27\u201329). Thus, the association of rs6311 and rs6313 with SCZ could be investigated not only individually but also in one haplotype block. Altogether, in this study, we attempted to examine the association of rs6311 and rs6313 with the risk of schizophrenia in patients of Iranian ancestry. Also, we tried to evaluate rs6311-rs6313 haplotype association with SCZ.\n2. Material And Methods\n2.1. Participants The total of three-hundred and ten individuals consist of One-hundred and fty-two cases and onehundred and fty-eight healthy controls (HC) participated in this study. SCZ group contains seventy-six males and seventy-six females (mean age = 38.75 \u00b1 10.92). Schizophrenic patients were selected from Roozbeh psychiatry hospital clients who were diagnosed with SCZ according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria by two independent adult psychiatrists. SCZ group had no comorbidity with other psychiatric conditions, immune system related diseases and, metabolic illnesses. HC group includes seventy-six males and eighty-two females (37.56 \u00b1 9.11). Controls recruited to the study through advertisements voluntarily and have neither familial nor personal history of mental disorders. After mentioning the necessary explanations about the research project, the consent form was signed by all the participants or their legal guardians. The study was\nPage 4/11\napproved by the Iran National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical Research and the Ethics Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran based on Helsinki Declaration criteria. 2.2. Genotyping 5 ml peripheral blood was collected from the cubital vein and stored in K3 EDTA tube. Genomic DNA was extracted using salting-out method and was quali ed by running the samples on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Also, UV-spectroscopy and optical density ratios are correspondingly exploited for the evaluation of DNA quantity and biological contamination. Both rs6311 and rs6313 were genotyped using restriction fragment length polymorphism- polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) and the target PCR product was digested overnight by the MSPI (HpaII) (Thermo Scienti c, ER0541) restriction enzyme. After enzymatic digestion, the shredded PCR product was run on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Speci c forward and reverse primers, PCR products and digested products length for rs6311 and rs6313 are displayed in Table 1. 2.3. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed in con dence interval (CI) of 95% and signi cant level of 0.05 by R programming language version 4.0.4 (R Core Team, 2021) in the Rstudio environment. The codes included R programming conventional commands or were called from CRAN packages. For determining Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) genetics package was utilized (Gregory Warnes, with contributions from Gregor Gorjanc, Friedrich Leisch and Michael Man. (2021). genetics: Population Genetics. R package version 1.3.8.1.3. https://CRAN.R project.org/package = genetics ). Demographic data was comprised between cases and control group by Wilcoxon rank sum test for age and Pearson's Chisquared test for sex comparison. In the following, comparison of allele and genotype frequency and genetic modeling either between SCZ and HC group or males and females were ful lled by Pearson's Chisquared test. Besides, Odds Ratio (OR) was estimated by Fisher's Exact Test for signi cant Chi-squared comparisons. In addition, logistic regression was implemented for general linear modeling to predict the risk of SCZ utilizing rs6311 and rs6313 genotypes. Finally, Haploview software Version 4.2 (www.broadinstitute.org/scienti c-community/science/programs/medical-and-populationgenetics/ haploview) was operated to pair-wise LD reckoning for rs6311 and rs6313 applying expectation\u2013 maximization (EM) algorithm and extracted p-value from haplotype analysis adjusted by Bonferroni method.\n3. Results\n3.1. Demographic results Independent t-test result revealed that there was no signi cant difference in age average between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls (W = 12732, p-value = 0.41). Also, the Pearson\u2019s Chi-squared test did not show any signi cant sex ratio between cases and controls (Chi-squared = 0.02, df = 1, p-value = 0.87). Table\u00a02 has presented demographic results.\nPage 5/11"

            "text": "Computing HWE for rs6311 conveyed that the equation of HWE was derived from balance in SCZ group (p-value = 1.59*10\u2212 4) whereas in HC group HWE remained in balance (p-value = 0.62). Nevertheless, both HC and SCZ group stuck in HWE for rs613 (SCZ: p-value = 0.42, HC: p-value = 0.43). 3.3. Allele frequency comparison Analysis of allele frequency for rs6313 demonstrated no signi cant difference in rs6313 T and C alleles between cases and controls (Chi-squared = 4.09*10\u2212 4, df = 1, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 0.98). But in HC group rs6313 T allele was signi cantly more frequent among females than males (Chi-squared = 7.80, df = 1, pvalue Chi\u2212squared = 5.25*10\u2212 3, OR: 0.51, p-value Fisher's Exact Test = 4.78*10\u2212 3). This nding was not replicated in SCZ group (Chi-squared = 0.84, df = 1, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 0.36). rs6311 allele frequency comparison illustrated the signi cant association of rs6311 with SCZ and signi cant increase of rs6311 T allele frequency patients (Chi-squared = 4.63, df = 1, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 0.03, OR: 1.43, p-value Fisher's Exact Test = 0.02). No signi cant interaction was obtained between sex and rs6311 allele frequency in cases and controls (HC: Chi-squared = 0, df = 1, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 1, SCZ: Chi-squared = 0.64, df = 1, pvalue Chi\u2212squared = 0.42). Tables\u00a03 & 4 indicate allele frequency comparisons. 3.4. Genotype and genetic model comparison rs6313 genotype comparison did not demonstrate signi cant difference between cases and controls (Chisquared = 9.81*10\u2212 3, df = 2, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 0.10) whereas, rs6311 genotype signi cantly differed between cases and controls (Chi-squared = 16.002, df = 2, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 3.35*10\u2212 4). Besides, case/control \u00d7 sex interaction revealed signi cant difference in genotype proportion in HC group for rs6313 (Chi-squared = 8.33, df = 2, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 0.01) but not for rs6311 (Chi-squared = 0.63, df = 2, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 0.73). On the report of previous studies, it seems that C allele of rs6313 and T allele of rs6311 are risk alleles for SCZ(20). Therefore, participants\u2019 genotype data were grouped based on rs6313 C allele carriers (CC + TC vs. TT) and rs6311 T allele carriers (TT + TC vs. CC). The ndings suggested that being carrier of rs6313 C allele did not associate with SCZ (Chi-squared = 0, df = 1, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 1) nevertheless, carriers of rs6313 T allele were signi cantly more observed among healthy females but not schizophrenic females (HC \u00d7 Sex: Chi-squared = 6.35, df = 1, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 0.01, OR: 0.37, p-value Fisher's Exact Test = 8.22*10\u2212 3 / SCZ \u00d7 Sex: Chi-squared = 2.60, df = 1, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 0.10). Analysis of genetic model for rs6311 expressed that carrying T allele was signi cantly associated with SCZ and TT + TC genotype was more observed among schizophrenic patients (Chi-squared = 13.49, df = 1, p-value Chi\u2212squared = 2.40*10\u2212 4, OR: 2.88, p-value Fisher's Exact Test = 1.70*10\u2212 4). rs6311 and rs6313 genotype and genetic model analysis have been unveiled in Tables\u00a05 & 6. 3.5. Haplotype analysis\nPage 6/11\nAs it was expected and according to the other populations\u2019 results, in both schizophrenic patients and healthy control groups rs6311 and rs6313 invented a haplotype block in Iranian population (SCZ: LOD = 15.52, D\u2019 = 0.64, R2 = 0.41, HC: LOD = 28.21, D\u2019 = 0.88, R2 = 0.56, SCZ + HC: LOD = 41.75, D\u2019 = 0.75, R2 = 0.47). Further analysis of haplotype exhibited that rs6311-rs6313 haplotype block (T-C) signi cantly associated with SCZ and T-C allele combination were more detected in SCZ group (Chi-squared = 11.44, df = 1, adjusted p-value Chi\u2212squared = 2.86*10\u2212 3, OR: 3.89, p-value Fisher's Exact Test = 4.41*10\u2212 4). Table\u00a07 shows haplotype frequency in cases and controls and Fig.\u00a01 has been visualized haplotype frequency. 3.6. General Linear Model (GLM) Finally, general linear model was generated by logistic regression to predict the risk of schizophrenia using rs6311 and rs6313. Considering the confounding effect of age and sex, it was manifested that the rs6311 risk allele (TT + TC) signi cantly increased the risk of SCZ incidence in both genders in the Iranian population. Nonetheless, rs6313 risk allele (CC + TC) elevated the risk of SCZ only in females but not males. Table\u00a08 indicates GLM analysis details.\n4. Discussion In the following study we scrutinized the association of 5-HTR2A\u00a0SNPs, rs6311 and rs6313, with SCZ not only individually but also within one haplotype block.\u00a0\nThe importance of investigating rs6311 and rs6313 is originated from the highlighted role of these SNPs in psychiatric conditions treatment response. Earlier, Chen et al. revealed that CC homozygosity for both rs6311 and rs6313 were associated with poor response to aripiprazole treatment in Han Chinese hospitalized schizophrenic patients, especially for negative symptoms(30), whereas, in 2020, Ma oletti et al. described those Italian schizophrenic patients who carried rs6313 T allele exhibited a higher response to risperidone and olanzapine treatment compared to CC homozygote schizophrenic patients\u00a0(31). Thus, it seems that 5-HTR2A polymorphisms could be potential predictors for SCZ incidence and treatment response. \u00a0\nHere, we perceived that the T allele\u00a0of 5-HTR2A promoter region SNP, rs6311, signi cantly exacerbates the risk of schizophrenia in the Iranian population. Previous studies have been clari ed the in uence of rs6311 genotype on 5-HTR2A expression. For instance, in 2013 it has been illustrated that the rs6311 C allele was signi cantly associated with higher expression of 5-HTR2A in the human brain cortex whereas(32), in 2016 Ruble et al. found that the T allele of both rs6311 and rs6313 elevated 5-HTR2A Anti-sense\u00a0expression in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)\u00a0(33). In addition, extracted results from autistic subjects indicated that the rs6311 AG genotype is associated with higher mean methylation in the 5-HTR2A\u00a0regulatory region, which Subsequently leads to 5-HTR2A\u00a0expression alteration(34). Thus, it could be possibly suggested that rs6311 association with SCZ is modulated by 5- HTR2A\u00a0expression alteration.\u00a0\nPage 7/11\nIn the following, although, we could not suggest a signi cant association between rs6313 alone and SCZ, we assessed the association of rs6311-rs6313 haplotype with SCZ. Despite the strong LD between rs6311 and rs6313, few studies have explored these two SNPs as one haplotype block in psychiatric disorders. E.g. \u00a0rs6311-rs6313-rs6305 haplotype (C-C-C) is associated with SCZ in the North Indian population\u00a0(35)\u00a0meanwhile, rs6311-rs6313 haplotype (T-T) grows the risk of autism in the Chinese Han population(19). Notwithstanding, we realized that the rs6311-rs6313 (T-C) haplotype raises the risk of SCZ in Iranian ancestry. As both rs6311 T allele and rs6313 C allele were implicitly associated with 5- HTR2A\u00a0downregulation(36), such a nding a rms formerly observations about 5-HTR2A\u00a0changes in SCZ. Ultimately, we revealed that the rs6313 T allele is signi cantly more trend among healthy females than males, which has been not reported previously. In earlier studies, the interaction of rs6313 and gender had also been reported. E. g. \u00a0rs6313 CC genotype in females associated with impulsivity and higher suicide risk\u00a0(37, 38). In justifying such observations, it can be acknowledged that since the 5-HT synthesis is signi cantly lower in females compared to males(39), 5-HTR2A\u00a0expression should subsequently reduce(40). On the other aspect, according to the Polesskaya et al. study in 2002, the rs6313 C allele leads to the downregulation of 5-HTR2A\u00a0in schizophrenia\u00a0(41).\u00a0Therefore, a higher frequency of rs6313 C allele in schizophrenic females could be de ned as an evolutionary association with a lower level of 5-HT in females with SCZ compared to males.\n\u00a0The following study faced some limitations. Limited in both SCZ and HC population size is one example of few restrictions this study encountered. In short, here we attempt to evaluate the association of two well-known SNPs, rs6311 and rs6313 with SCZ in the Iranian population. We noticed that rs6311 and rs6311-rs6313 haplotype were signi cantly associated with SCZ as rs6313 is signi cantly more frequent among females. It is obvious that further studies are needed to illuminate the reproducibility and reliability of our ndings.\u00a0\nDeclarations Compliance with Ethical Standards: Funding: This study was funded by\u00a0Tehran University of Medical Sciences\u00a0(grant number\u00a026440).\nEthical approval: All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\nInformed consent: \u00a0Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\nReferences 1.
