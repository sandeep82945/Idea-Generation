Based on the provided text, the following sentences/portion of text mention future research direction:

1. "Future research might perform survival analysis using more complete data, with less need to censor observations, which represent an older network. This would provide a case study, where the findings of this paper could be corroborated. Additionally, the value of censor-adjusted survival modeling could be studied and demonstrated." - from the section on "a probabilistic approach to reliability analysis of district heating networks incorporating censoring: a report of implementation experiences."

2. "The innumerable options for each entity in the tech stack open new paths to different approaches and benchmarks. This will also help choose the best-tailored cloud provider for the solutionâ€™s specific needs." - from the conclusion of "design of data management service platform."

These portions suggest areas where further investigation could yield additional insights or improvements related to the topics discussed in the respective sections of the research paper.
