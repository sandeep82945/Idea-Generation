    "abstractText": "The durability of C3S-C3A paste with varied C3A content (0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) against sulfate attack at various attack ages (3 d, 7 d, 28 d, and 180 d) was investigated in this study through the examinations of corrosion product composition, Ca/Si and Al/Si of calcium-(aluminum)-silicatehydrate (C-(A)-S-H) gel, formation and evolution of microstructure, migration and transformation of Al containing phase products, and pore structure. The results indicated that sulfate attack can promote the hydration reaction in C3S-C3A paste, thus accelerating the production of C-(A)-S-H gel in the paste. With the increase of C3A content, the acceleration effect becomes more significant. In addition, sulfate attack led to the dealumination and decalcification of C-(A)-S-H gel, resulting in the reduction of the gelling power of C-(A)-S-H gel. The degree of dealumination and decalcification of C-(A)-S-H gel increases with the increase of C3A content. At the same time, free Al and Ca promote the formation of expansive products such as ettringite and gypsum. Finally, under the action of sulfate, the pore characterization of C3S-C3A paste deteriorated, showing a decrease in specific surface area, cumulative pore volume and average pore diameter.",

            "text": "With the development of offshore engineering, more and more building structures have to consider the impact of erosion media. As a widely existing erosion medium in practical engineering applications, the research on the damage of sulfate ions to concrete structures has received extensive attention. Sulfate attack is one of the long-term durability issues in cement-based materials. During the service of concrete structures, sulfate enters into the concrete through diffusion and reacts with cement hydration products Ca(OH)2 and C-(A)-S-H to generate the expansive products gypsum and ettringite (AFt), which causes expansion stress in the concrete and accelerates the destruction of concrete. This process reduces the alkalinity of pore solution in the concrete, leading to the instability of C-(A)-S-H gel after dissolution, thus losing the gelling ability [1\u20136]. The mechanical effects on the structural elements can be very serious and can compromise the reliability of the entire construction. As the use of concrete structures is unavoidable in geological sites rich in sulfate, researchers have carried out a series of studies on the performance control of concrete under sulfate attack. C-(A)-S-H, as an important component and main strength source of paste, has received considerable attention in research. Gollop et al. [7] studied the influence of sulfate ion on the microstructure and composition of cement hydration paste, and found that under sulfate attack, Ca2+ in C-(A)-S-H would dissolve into the pore solution, promoting the crystallization and development of AFt. Kunther et al. [8] studied the influence of sulfate ion on the microstructure of C-(A)-S-H gel with different synthesized Ca/Si. The results showed that under sulfate attack, interlayer Ca2+ in C-(A)S-H gel would be separated and react with SO42\u2212 to form gypsum crystal. The degree\nMaterials 2023, 16, 77. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16010077 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 77 2 of 14\nof decalcification of C-(A)-S-H gel increases with the increase of the initial Ca/Si. Since the C-(A)-S-H structure is mainly affected by silicon and aluminum phases in clinker, the study of C3S-C3A paste and its C-(A)-S-H microstructure formed by the cohydration of C3S and C3A can effectively characterize the hydration process of actual cementitious materials in cement and the formation and evolution mechanism of cementitious-paste microstructure [9,10]. Nicoleau et al. [11] found that SO42\u2212 can change the charge on the surface of C3S particles by adsorbing on the surface of C3S particles, and finally inhibit the charge of C3S particles. Al3+ can covalently combine with the silica monomer on the surface of C3S particles and inhibit the hydration process of C3S in a weak alkaline environment. At present, the formation and evolution of cementitious paste hydration products and their microstructures are mainly studied with cement and other mineral admixtures. Because the hydration processes of multiple minerals in the cement system are coupled and interfere with each other, it is difficult to characterize the hydration process of a single mineral and its influence mechanism on the paste microstructure. In addition, most of the research on the composition and microstructure of C-(A)-S-H gel is carried out by hydrothermal synthesis of soluble Ca salt, silicate, and aluminate, but this method does not involve the hydration process of cement clinker. It is unclear whether its composition and microstructure are the same as that of C-(A)-S-H generated by hydration of actual cementitious materials. Therefore, it is necessary to study the influence mechanism of the type and content of the single mineral of cement clinker on the formation and evolution of the hydrated products and microstructure of the composite hydrated paste, taking the single mineral of cement clinker prepared by the solid-state sintering method as the object. In summary, C3S-C3A paste was prepared from C3S and C3A single mineral synthesized by the solid-state sintering method, and the composite paste with C3A substitution rates of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 20% was immersed in 5 wt% Na2SO4 solution. The composition of erosion products, the formation and evolution of Ca/Si, Al/Si and microstructure of C-(A)-S-H gel, the migration and transformation of Al containing phase products, and the change of pore structure of C3S-C3A paste at different erosion ages were studied by means of modern testing techniques such as XRD, SEM, TG-DSC, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and hydration heat analysis."

Determination of Free Calcium Oxide in Single Mineral of Cement Clinker\nIn this experiment, the ethylene glycol method was used to calibrate the f-CaO content in the synthetic single mineral [13]. The specific operation steps are as follows: put a specified amount of single mineral into the ethylene glycol anhydrous ethanol mixed solution, add the methyl red potassium bromophenol green indicator and stir evenly. Stir at 65\u201370 \u25e6C for 30 min to make f-CaO in single mineral react with ethylene glycol to generate calcium glycol (see Formula 1 for reaction equation). Carry out vacuum suction filtration of the suspended solution and wash the filter residue with anhydrous ethanol three times. Then titrate the filtered filtrate with hydrochloric acid standard solution. When the solution changes from blue to orange, the titration end point is reached. Record the consumption of hydrochloric acid standard solution of the sample.\nf \u2212 CaO + CH2OH \u2212 CH2OH = CH2O \u2212 CH2O \u2212 Ca + H2O (1)\nPut a specified amount of CaCO3 into a crucible and burn it at 950\u20131000 \u25e6C until the mass is constant to obtain CaO for the titration of hydrochloric acid. Take a specified amount of CaO and put it into the ethylene glycol absolute ethanol mixed solution, titrate it in the same way as the sample, and record the consumption of hydrochloric acid standard solution of the calibration sample. Finally, the f-CaO content in single mineral is calculated according to Formulas (2) and (3).\nT = mCaO\u00d71000\nVCaO (2)\nF = T \u00d7 Vc\nmc\u00d71000 \u00d7100% (3)\nwhere, T is the CaO titer of hydrochloric acid standard solution, representing the CaO mass corresponding to the unit volume of hydrochloric acid standard solution, mg/mL; mCaO refers to the mass of CaO used for the titration of hydrochloric acid, g; VCaO represents the volume of hydrochloric acid standard solution consumed during titration calibration, mL; mc is the mass of cement single mineral sample, g; Vc is the volume of hydrochloric acid standard solution consumed by cement single mineral sample, mL; F is the mass fraction of f-CaO in the single mineral sample, %. The results of determination of f-CaO content in synthetic single mineral by ethylene glycol method are shown in Table 2. The results show that the f-CaO content of C3S and C3A single mineral was less than 1% after sintering three times, which can be used to study the formation and evolution mechanism of C3S-C3A paste microstructure.\n2.4.2. X-ray Diffraction Test\nD8 ADVANCE X-ray diffraction analyzer produced by Bruker in Germany was used to test the reaction degree of single mineral in the sample and the composition of hydration products. Wherein, the target was Cu(K\u03b1), the rated power was 12 kW, the working current was 100 mA, and the scanning range was (\u03b8) 5\u25e6\u201370\u25e6 in steps of 0.02\u25e6. The XRD diffraction pattern of LUHPC was fully fitted by Jade 6.5 software, and the fitting factor R was \u22647%. Then the phase composition of LUHPC was analyzed using a semiquantitative method (RIR). The test sample was the sample powder passing through a 200-mesh sieve.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 77 5 of 14\n2.4.3. SEM\u2013EDS Test\nThe micromorphology of C3S-C3A paste was observed with QUANTA FEG 450 field emission environmental scanning electron microscope produced by Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan. The element content of C-(A)-S-H gel area was analyzed to study the Ca/Si change of C-(A)-S-H gel of C3S-C3A paste. The working voltage was 15\u201320 kV, the vacuum degree could reach 8 \u00d7 above 10\u22123 Pa, and the magnification was 1000\u20135000 times. The test sample was a 5 mm wide sheet.\n2.4.4. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer Test\nThe AVANCE III 400 MHz solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer produced by Bruker, Germany, was used to conduct 29Si NMR and 27Al NMR tests on the samples. The data were processed based on the Gauss\u2013Lorentz method, and the relative intensity (I) of the characteristic peak was obtained by deconvolution with PeakFit software [14]. The average silicon chain length (MCL) of C-S-H gel in the sample and the degree of substitution of Al3+ for Si4+ (Al(4)/Si) on the silicon oxygen chain were quantitatively calculated by the following Formulas (4) and (5) [15].\nMCL = 2 [ I ( Q1 ) +I(Q 2(0Al)) + 1.5I ( Q2(1Al) )] I ( Q1 ) (4) Al[4]/Si = I ( Q2(1Al) )\n2 [ I ( Q1 ) +I(Q 2(0Al)) + I ( Q2(1Al) )] (5) where, I(Q1) represents the relative intensity of the absorption peak corresponding to the [SiO4] tetrahedron at the end of the silica chain in the C-S-H gel structure of the hydrated paste; I(Q2(0Al)) represents the relative intensity of the absorption peak corresponding to the [SiO4] tetrahedron connected to two [SiO4] tetrahedrons on the straight chain of the C-S-H gel in the hydrated paste; I(Q2(1Al)) represents the relative intensity of the absorption peak corresponding to the [SiO4] tetrahedron adjacent to an [AlO4] tetrahedron on the straight chain of the C-S-H gel in the hydrated paste. The test sample is the sample powder passing 200-mesh sieve.\n2.4.5. Nitrogen Adsorption Test\nThe ASAP2020 full-automatic fast specific surface area and porosity analyzer provided by McMurray Teck Instrument Co., Ltd. (Fort McMurray, AB, Canada) was used to test the specific surface area and pore distribution of the sample. The specific surface area of BET was analyzed using Langmuir surface area model, with the lowest resolution of 0.01 m2/g. The Dubin\u2013Radushkevich micropore area model was used for pore size distribution test, and the range was 0.35\u2013500 nm. The test sample was a 5 mm cube."

Al(4)/Si Figure 5 demonstrates that compared with the noneroded sample, the Al(4)/Si of C(A)-S-H of C3S-C3A paste with 5%, 10%, and 20% C3A content decreased by 17.39%, 16.22%, and 14.89% respectively after 7 d of Na2SO4 erosion; after 28 d of Na2SO4 erosion, Al(4)/Si of C-S-H decreased by 17.64%, 16.67%, and 17.95, respectively; and after 180 d of Na2SO4 erosion, the Al(4)/Si of C-S-H decreased by 33.33%, 38.01%, and 29.03%, respectively. This indicates that Na2SO4 erosion can lead to the decrease of Al(4)/Si of C-(A)-S-H gel of C3S-C3A paste, th t is, dealumination. This is becaus when Al replaces i on the silicon xyg n chain of (A)-S-H gel, the stability of the system will be reduced. At this time, the Al-O bond on the generated C-(A)-S-H gel is longer than the Si-O bond before substitution, making the Al atom in the metastable state, which is easier to detach under the erosion of Na2SO4, forming other aluminum phase products [17]. Therefore, with the extension of the erosion age, Al(4)/Si decreases.\nFigure 5.

The analysis results show that: (1) Sulfate attack caused the relative content of Al(4) in C3S-C3A paste to decrease, which was consistent with the analysis results of the 29Si NMR spectrum; (2) sulfate attack led to an increase in the relative content of AFt and a decrease in the relative content of AFm and this was because there was enough SO42\u2212 in the erosion solution to support the conversion of Al(4) from C-(A)-S-H gel to AFt instead of AFm; and (3) sulfate attack could also reduce the relative content of TAH, because TAH and SO42\u2212 can transform with AFm and AFt at room temperature [18]. Under sulfate attack, the chemical balance moved to the right, resulting in a decrease in the relative content of TAH."

            "text": "The C3S-C3A paste eroded in 5 wt% Na2SO4 solution for 28 d after hydration for 1 d was observed by a scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, and 20 points were selected on the C-(A)-S-H gel of each sample for element analysis. The average Ca/Si of composite paste C-(A)-S-H gel was calculated according to the results, as shown in Figure 7. According to SEM\u2013EDS, Ca/Si of C3S-C3A paste C-(A)-S-H gel after sulfate attack still increases with the increase of C3A content. In addition, compared with the SEM\u2013EDS map of the noneroded C3S-C3A paste, the Ca/Si of C3S-C3A paste with 0%, 10%, and 20% C3A content decreased by 12.81%, 14.29%, and 16.16% respectively after sulfate attack. This shows that sulfate attack will lead to the decrease of Ca/Si of C3S-C3A paste, and the decrease range will increase with the increase of initial Ca/Si of the paste. This is because SO42\u2212 in Na2SO4 solution brings Ca2+ between layers or interfaces of C-(A)-S-H gel into solution through a diffusion adsorption desorption process to form gypsum and combines with Al phase hydration products in paste to further generate AFm or AFt, leading to the decalcification of C-(A)-S-H gel. The degree of decalcification of the composite paste C-(A)-S-H gel is related to its initial Ca/Si. Ding et al. [19] studied the preparation of C-(A)-S-H gel with Ca/Si from high to low using hydrothermal synthesis and studied the effect of sulfate attack on the synthesized C-(A)-S-H gel and Ca/Si of gelled paste. The results showed that the degree of decalcification of sulfate on C-(A)-S-H gel increased with the increase of initial Ca/Si of C-(A)-S-H gel. The addition of C3A led to the increase of interlayer Ca2+ of C3S-C3A paste C-(A)-S-H gel, which reduced the thermodynamic stability of the Ca-O layer of C-(A)-S-H gel. Therefore, the decalcification amplitude of C3S-C3A paste C-(A)-S-H gel under sulfate attack increased with the increase of C3A content.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 77 10 of 14 Materials 2023, 16, 77 10 of 14\n(a) Pure C3S paste (b) 10% C3A\n(c) 20% C3A (d) Ca/Si of C3S-C3A paste under sulfate paste\nFigure 7.

Composition of Hydration Products It can be seen from Figure 8 that the hydrated products of C3S-C3A paste under sul-\nfate attack mainly include gypsum, AFt, Ca(OH)2, and some C3S and C3A that have not been completely hydrated. With the extension of erosion age, the intensity of C3S and C3A diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns of the paste decreased gradually, and basically disappeared at 180 d. Compared with XRD patterns of noneroded C3S-C3A composite hydrated paste, it was found that the diffraction peak of gypsum in the composite paste under sulfate attack increased with the increase of erosion age. Moreover, the second peak of AFt (close to 14\u00b0) disappeared on the 7th and 28th days. This was due to the reaction of C3A and sulfate ion to generate AFt at the initial stage of hydration. However, with the progress of hydration reaction, the invasion rate of sulfate ion was less than its consumption rate in chemical reaction. Therefore, the undersaturation of sulfate ions in the paste increased, and AFt was converted to AFm. With the erosion taking place, the defects in the paste increased, and the sulfate ion content increased accordingly. Therefore, the peak of AFt at 14\u00b0 appeared again in the 180 d XRD spectrum. In addition, the apparent AFt diffraction peak appeared in the late attack period (28\u2013180 d), and the intensity of AFt peak increased with the increase of erosion age. It showed that SO42\u2212 introduced by sulfate attack will react with the hydration products of C3S-C3A paste to generate gypsum and AFt, thus causing the change of C3S-C3A paste composition.\n1.77 1.86 1.92 1.65\n1.70\n1.75\n1.80\n1.85\n1.90\n1.95\n2.00\n2.05 2.10 0% C3A 10% C3A 20% C3A\nC a/\nSi r\nat io\nAverage Ca/Si ratio\nFigure 7.

Sulfate attack reduced the pore specific surface area, cumulative pore volume, and average pore diameter of C3S-C3A paste. 6. minerals contained in concre e structures in p actic l engineering applications re not limited to C3S and C3A. In th future, we will consid r conducting experiments on\nMaterials 2023, 16, 77 14 of 14\nmineral phases such as C4AF and C2S. Through the test data, the mineral composition of the cementitious system was designed to prepare concrete structures that can achieve practical engineering application.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Q.Z.; Software, G.R.; Validation, T.H.; Investigation, Q.Z., T.H. and G.Z.; Resources, G.Z.; Data curation, G.R.; Writing\u2014original draft, Q.Z. and T.H.; Writing\u2014 review & editing, G.Z. and Q.D.; Visualization, Y.L.; Supervision, Y.L.; Project administration, Y.L.; Funding acquisition, Q.D.
