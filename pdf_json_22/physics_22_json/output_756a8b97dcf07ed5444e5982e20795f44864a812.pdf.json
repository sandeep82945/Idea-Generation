    "abstractText": "The paper explores a previously unknown connection relating the symmetry properties of an oscillator steady-state to the orthogonal representation of amplitude and phase variables in the small-signal regime. It is shown that only circuits producing perfectly symmetric steady-states can produce an orthogonal Floquet decomposition. Considering room temperature operation this scenario implies zero AM-PM noise conversion. This surprising and novel result follows directly from the predictions of a rigorous model framework first described herein. The work presented in this text extend the current state-of-the-art w.r.t. oscillator small-signal/noise characterization.",

            "text": "The oscillator small-signal/linear-response (LR) governs the circuit dynamics in reply to small perturbations, e.g. noise, around the periodic steady-state (PSS). Rigorous methods for characterizing oscillator dynamics in a noisy environment are absolutely critical for developing analysis/synthesis tools used to optimize performance of various critical circuits found in modern communication systems.\nIn the general case, small-signal oscillator amplitude and phase variables are defined in-terms of mutually oblique (i.e. non-orthogonal) Floquet vectors decomposing the LR map [1\u20134]. One important implication of this oblique representation is the integration of amplitude-noise into oscillator phase response; a process known as oscillator AMPM noise conversion2 [5\u201315]. The aim of the model described herein is to seek an answer to the open question :what type of oscillators support a fully orthogonal small-signal representation implying zero AM-PM ? This scenario is represented mathematically in-terms of an orthogonal Floquet decomposition (OFD) of the LR. The topic was previously briefly studied by the authors in [15], however, only for the special case of planar oscillator and strictly from a simulation-based perspective.\nThe paper documents and validates the novel SYM-OFD model framework with specific focus paid to the remarkable statement : ORTHOGONALITY (OFD) \u21d2 STEADY-STATE SYMMETRY. This statement is both notable and unanticipated. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first ever description of a direct analytical link relating a specific decomposition of the oscillator LR and the properties of the underlying PSS.

(correspondence e-mail: t.djurhuus@physik.uni-frankfurt.de).\n2note that this implies a representation where the noise perturbing the oscillator is decomposed in-terms of an orthogonal frame (see discussion in section 3.2 for details).\nIt is important to note that the above statement references a strict one-way relation i.e. an orthogonal LR representation implies symmetry. The reverse implication is however not true as symmetry does not imply orthogonality3.\nThe validity of the orthogonal model representation has been debated in the literature for several decades (see e.g. [1,3,4,9,10,16]). Unlike the natural Floquet description, an orthogonal model representation is, in the general case, artificial(un-natural) meaning that is coordinate dependent which implies that corresponding model operators will not represent tensors. This issue has important implications for oscillator LR modelling. A coordinate-independent/tensor approach, by definition, always leads to simplest, cleanest and most generalized model description [4]. Our work herein provides a definitive resolution of the aforementioned open debate : in-order for a orthogonal modelling approach to be valid (i.e. be natural, coordinate-independent) the underlying PSS must be symmetric (orthogonality implies symmetry).\nIn answering these types of open question, using a rigorous, proof-based, methodology, the novel SYM-OFD framework advances the current state-of-the-art w.r.t. time-domain oscillator small-signal/noise characterization and modelling. It introduces several novel ideas and insights such as e.g. why OFD\u2019s are not observed in real-life oscillator descriptions where non-linear device-models make it impossible to attain perfect PSS symmetry. Finally, the methodology enables a whole new category of numerical optimization tools which could potentially find use in future applications.\nIn-order to briefly explore the last point, consider e.g. a scenario where some oscillator figure-of-merit (FoM), describing a particular performance metric of interest, attains an optimum at an OFD state4. We introduce two strictly positive scalars, \u039b,\u03a5, which measure the deviation from PSS symmetry, and OFD solution state, respectively, with \u03a5 = 0,\u039b = 0 corresponding to perfect symmetry/OFD (see section 6.1). In the vicinity of zeros for these two measures, the theory then predicts that \u03a5 (orthogonality) will be minimized alongside \u039b (symmetry) i.e. \u03a5 \u2192 0 \u21d2 \u039b \u2192 0. Using standard minimization routines [17], min(\u039b) is then derived, starting from a given initial condition in parameterspace. If parameter sets, achieving a set \u03a5 goal, indeed exist then the SYM-OFD methodology guarantees that at-least one of these can be found in the vicinity of equivalent symmetry (zero) points. Due to the one-way nature of the orthogonality/symmetry relation there will be the possibility of false-positives (symmetry point may imply a non-OFD state). However, even with this serious drawback, the scheme proposed here is easily several orders-of-magnitudes faster than any competing approach5. The idea discussed here is only possible due to the connections forged by the SYM-OFD framework. It is simply not possible to directly optimize/minimize the OFD measure, \u03a5, given that the LR equations are unknown a-priori to calculating the PSS."

            "text": "Section 3 starts with a quick introduction to some basic underlying topics (tangent-bundle, Floquet theory, OFD oscillators etc.). The analysis in the next two sections, leading up to the main result in theorem 5.1, can then be divided into 4 consecutive steps (refer to acronym/symbol lists in back of paper) :\n1. Sections 4 and 4.1 : A normal-form oscillator (NF-OSC), o = (\u03c8\u03c4 , \u03be), on the domain U, is used to parameterize the oscillator under investigation, q = (\u03c6\u03c4 , \u03b3), on domain Ws (see figs. 3 and 5). This parametrization is facilitated in-terms of a unique conjugation-map, h : U \u2192 Ws, where h conjugates o and q; written o \u223ch q. Conjugation preserves invariant sets and specifically h(\u03be) = \u03b3.\n2. Section 4.2 : The NF-OSC, o, is chosen according to the two criteria : it must have a canonical (simple) model description and it must be a OFD oscillator (o \u2208 O\u22a5). The chosen model is given the handle PNF-OSC. It is shown that PNF-OSC limit-cycle is perfectly symmetric \u03be \u2208 SYMn. 3. Section 4.3 : Let o \u223ch q, where, o \u2208 O\u22a5, is the PNF-OSC developed in step #2 above. The demand, q \u2208 O\u22a5, restricts the conjugation map as h \u2208 HC \u2282 H (see proposition 4.3 & symbol list). In summary : let q be conjugate to the PNF-OSC, then, q \u2208 O\u22a5, will hold if, and only if, h \u2208 HC . A new conjugation operator (equivalence relation),\nc\u223ch, is introduced and the above statement is written (see proposition 4.4) as q \u2208 O\u22a5 \u21d4 o c\u223ch q.\n3this is easily seen by considering simple 2D counter-examples of the form (polar coordinates) r\u0307 = F (r), \u03c6\u0307 = 1 + G(r) with F (a) = 0, dF (a)/dr < 0 and dG(a)/dr 6= 0. This class of systems generate symmetric limit-cycle at r = a but does not produce an OFD (see discussion in section 3).\n4an example here could e.g. be the simple quadrature VCO (QVCO) oscillator circuit which was shown attain optimum performance when tuned to such an configuration [12\u201314].\n5the described algorithm is, to our knowledge, the only one of its kind so the only alternative is brute-force sampling of parameter points; which scales exponentially with the dimension of the parameter-space. In comparison, the algorithm described above scales polynomially (due to minimization algorithm).\n4. Proposition 5.2 : Using Liouville\u2019s and Schottkys theorems [18\u201323] it is shown that the conjugation map, h \u2208 HC , must have the form h(y) = \u03c1Ay where \u03c1 \u2208 R \\ {0} is a non-zero real value and A \u2208 O(n) is an orthogonal n\u00d7 n matrix.\n5. Theorem 5.1 : The result is reached by following the chain of steps #1-#4 described above : #1 (h(\u03be) = \u03b3) \u2192 #2 (\u03be \u2208 SYMn) \u2192 #3 (h \u2208 HC) \u2192 #4 (h(y) = \u03c1Ay) which allows the calculation \u03b3 = h(\u03be) = A\u03be \u2208 SYMn where A\u03be \u2208 SYMn holds because multiplication by the orthogonal map A preserves the symmetry of \u03be (i.e. maps SYMn \u2192 SYMn). At this point we have reached the main result (theorem 5.1) : q \u2208 O\u22a5 \u21d2 \u03b3 \u2208 SYMn which, in words, says that only oscillators with a perfectly symmetric limit-cycle support an OFD (ORTHOGONALITY \u21d2 STEADY-STATE SYMMETRY). Please note that the above statement is a strict one-way relation6.\nFinally, it is proven in section 5.1 that the analysis results, carried out using the specific PNF-OSC model, are in-fact unique. As discussed in section 5.1 this follows straight from the fact that, c\u223c, represents an equivalence relation. Section 6 details a series of numerical experiment, spanning several different oscillator circuits, all of which, unequivocally, support the claim introduced in theorem 5.1."

            "text": "Consider fig. 5 which shows the PNF-OSC parameterizing an unspecified oscillator circuit; i.e. the N-OSC. The dynamics of the PNF-OSC circuit is illustrated in fig. 4 which shows transient orbits plus the limit-cycle of this circuit. This oscillator circuit is designed to be an OFD oscillator and we find that the limit-cycle is symmetric. The N-OSC circuit in fig. 5, could be any hyperbolic n-dimensional oscillator e.g. one of the circuits described in section 6. The parametrization map, h, transforming the PNF-OSC orbits into N-OSC orbits (and vice-versa through h\u22121) is guaranteed to exist and to be unique (see section 4). This transformation preserves invariant spaces and hence maps the PNF-OSC limit-cycle into the equivalent N-OSC set (see fig. 5 caption).\nA conjugation-map, h, relating two OFD oscillators, must belong to the special subset of maps HC (propositions 4.3 and 4.4). Hence, only a special type of map can transform between two OFD oscillators. The PNF-OSC is, by design, an OFD oscillator and it follows that the N-OSC (righthand-side of fig. 5) will be an OFD as well if, and only if, h belongs to the set HC . So now it becomes clear why the PNF-OSC was chosen as an OFD oscillator. We are trying to describe the subset of all N-OSC circuits which are also OFD oscillators. This then means that both the PNF-OSC and N-OSC will be OFD circuits which then automatically restricts the possible conjugation/parametrization-map candidates from any smooth map, h \u2208 H, to the much smaller subset h \u2208 HC \u2282 H. This analysis trick proves fruitful as we are able to partially characterize this smaller subset of maps (see section 5). Specifically, the theory shows that a map in HC transform the limit-cycles in fig. 5 in-terms of simple linear orthogonal map (scalar scaling + rotation + inversion). This map preserves symmetry and the N-OSC limit-cycle will hence also be symmetric. This last statement is the main result of this paper, i.e. theorem 5.1, which represents a strict one-way relation (see footnote 6.)\nThe question of uniqueness of this result, derived using the specific PNF-OSC model, becomes important to discuss. Why can we not just chose some other OFD model, call it XNF-OSC, perhaps even with a non-symmetric limit-cycle and then produce a completely different conclusion? As explained in section 5.1, the uniqueness of theorem 5.1 is saved by fact that conjugation (parametrization) represents an equivalence relation. Basically, if the XNF-OSC parameterizes the N-OSC then it must also parameterize the PNF-OSC and vice-versa (via inverse map) which then implies that the XNF-OSC (an OFD oscillator) must have a symmetric limit-cycle (see above discussion). Hence, whether we parameterize the N-OSC in fig. 5 using the PNF-OSC, the XNF-OSC, or any other possible OFD template, is irrelevant. We will always arrive at the same result in theorem 5.1."

The conjugation relation is represented herein by the operator \u223ch, or simply \u223c, and the conjugation of oscillators o = (\u03c8\u03c4 , \u03be) and q = (\u03c6\u03c4 , \u03b3) is then written\n\u03c8 \u223ch \u03c6 := \u03c8\u03c4 = h\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c6\u03c4 \u25e6 h (6)\nwhere below we also use the notation o \u223c q. Equation (6) directly implies a similar conjugacy of the corresponding iterated maps \u03c8(k) \u223c \u03c6(k) where \u03b1(k) = \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 \u03b1 (k times). The operator \u223c is an equivalence relation8.\n8to show this we need to prove reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity [27, 28]. The operator is reflexive \u03ba \u223ch \u03ba for h = id (the identity map). Then \u03ba \u223ch \u03b8 \u21d4 \u03b8 \u223cg \u03ba for g = h\n\u22121 proves symmetry. Let \u03b8 = f \u25e6 \u03ba \u25e6 f\u22121 and \u03b8 = g\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 g. Then f \u25e6 \u03ba \u25e6 f\u22121 = g\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 g \u21d4 (g \u25e6 f) \u25e6 \u03ba = \u03c3 \u25e6 (g \u25e6 f) and \u03ba = (g \u25e6 f)\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 (g \u25e6 f). Thus \u03ba \u223cf \u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8 \u223cg \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03ba \u223ch \u03c3 with h = f \u25e6 g proving transitivity.\nGiven the orbit, \u03c8\u03c4 (y0), on U, with initial condition \u03c80(y0) = y0, the conjugate flow, \u03c6\u03c4 (x0), will correspond to the orbit with initial condition \u03c60(x0) = x0 = h(y0) on Ws and we can write eq. (6) as\nh \u25e6 \u03c8\u03c4 (y0) = \u03c6\u03c4 (x0) (7)\nwhich shows that h maps orbits in U onto orbits in Ws while keeping the time parametrization. Figure 3 gives a schematic illustration of the topics discussed here. Consider an invariant-set Q in U i.e. \u03c8\u03c4 (Q) \u2282 Q for all \u03c4 . From the conjugation relation eq. (7) it then follows that \u03c6\u03c4 (h(Q)) = \u03c6\u03c4 (S) = h \u25e6 \u03c8\u03c4 (Q) \u2282 h(Q) = S, where S = h(Q), and\n\u03c8\u03c4 (Q) \u2282 Q\u21d4 \u03c6\u03c4 (S) \u2282 S (8)\nwhere the left arrow follows from considering the inverse transformation h\u22121 (i.e. the map from Ws to U). An invariant set, under \u03c8\u03c4 on U, Q, thus corresponds to an invariant set, S = h(Q), under the conjugated flow, \u03c6\u03c4 , on Ws; and vice-versa. Repeating this analysis for the iterated map version of eq. (6) it follows that invariant sets under the iterated map are also preserved. The oscillator limit-cycles \u03be, \u03b3, are invariant sets of the flows \u03c8\u03c4 , \u03c6\u03c4 on U and Ws, respectively, and from eq.

Let r = \u221a\ny21 + y 2 2 , \u03c6 = arctan(y2/y1) be the polar coordinates indexing the y1, y2\nplane and consider the transformed coordinates y\u0304 = (\u03c6, r, w, z) \u2208 Rn where sub-coordinate vectors w \u2208 Rm and z \u2208 R2k contain the remaining n\u22122 y-coordinates9. As y\u0304 is an n-dimensional coordinate system the dimension of these sub-vectors are constrained through n = 2 +m+ 2k (see footnote 9). As n \u2265 2 is assumed, it always possible to find two numbersm, k \u2265 0 such that this constraint is upheld. Proposition 4.1. The new coordinates y\u0304 = (\u03c6, r, w, z) \u2208 Rn, indexing the parameter manifold U, are orthogonal.\nProof. The polar coordinates (\u03c6, r), indexing the y1, y2 plane, represent an orthogonal coordinate system in this plane [29]. The remaining coordinates (y3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yn) \u2208 Rn\u22122 are orthogonal to the y1, y2 plane and furthermore\n9here coordinate sub-vectors w, z simply represent place-holders for the remaining n\u2212 2 coordinates (y3, y4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yn) with the constraint that sub-vector z is of even dimension 2k.

However, coordinate subvectorsw, z are simply containers holding this remaining set of Cartesian y-coordinates (see text above and footnote 9) and it hence follows trivially that y\u0304 = (\u03c6, r, w, z) = (\u03c6, r, y3, y4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 yn) \u2208 Rn is an orthogonal coordinate system.\nIn these new coordinates, the dynamics of the NF-OSC on U, is modelled in-terms of the autonomous ODE, y\u0307 = g(y), of the form\n\u03c6\u0307 = 1 r\u0307 = \u00b5r(1 \u2212 r) w\u0307i = \u2212\u03b2iwi i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m z\u03072i\u22121 = \u2212\u03c3iz2i\u22121 + \u03bdiz2i i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k z\u03072i = \u2212\u03c3iz2i \u2212 \u03bdiz2i\u22121 i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k\n(10)\nwith \u00b5, \u03b1, \u03b2i, \u03c3 \u2208 R+ are a collection of positive real parameters whereas \u03bdi \u2208 R\\{0} is a non-zero real parameter. From inspection, it follows that the system in eq.

(11) hence simply describes a unit circle in the y1, y2 plane. Henceforth, the NF-OSC, o = (\u03c8\u03c4 , \u03be), where \u03c8\u03c4 is the flow on U generated by integrating the ODE in eq. (10), will be known as the PNF-OSC (polar normal-form).\nProposition 4.2. the PNF-OSC system, defined in-terms of the ODE in eq. (10), belong to the OFD oscillator class, o \u2208 O\u22a5.\nProof. From eq. (2) the bundle T\u03b3R n is spanned by the Floquet vectors (u1(\u03c4), u2(\u03c4), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , un(\u03c4)). From eq. (23) in appendix A we have T\u03beR n = span(\u03c6\u0302, r\u0302, {w\u0302i}mi=1, {z\u03022i\u00b1jz\u03022i\u22121}ki=1) with the notation, x\u0302, representing the coordinatevector corresponding to coordinate function, x. From proposition 4.1 the coordinate system y\u0304 = (\u03c6, r, w, z) is orthog-\nonal which implies that the corresponding coordinate vectors \u03c6\u0302, r\u0302, w\u0302i etc. are orthogonal. By definition (see eq. (3)) T\u03beR n \u2208 B\u22a5 and from the definition in eq.

The orbits of an example 5-dimensional PNF-OSC system (m = k = 1) were calculated by numerically integrating eq. (10) and the resulting curves are plotted in fig. 4 together with the limit-cycle, \u03be, defined in eq. (11).\n4.3 The set HC and operator c\u223ch\nWe seek to use parametrization, o \u223c q, in-order to identify all N-OSC oscillators q = (\u03c6\u03c4 , \u03b3) on Ws which belong to the class O\u22a5. From proposition 4.2, o \u2208 O\u22a5, and this in-turn places certain limitations on h \u2223 \u2223\n\u03be (h restricted to \u03be)\nProposition 4.3. Let o \u223ch q where o = (\u03c8\u03c4 , \u03be) \u2208 O\u22a5 is the PNF-OSC defined in eqs. (10) and (11). Then q \u2208 O\u22a5 \u21d4 h \u2223 \u2223\n\u03be is conformal (angle preserving).\nProof. From eq. (5) it follows that at every point of the PNF-OSC PSS orbit ys(\u03c4) \u2208 \u03be, the Jacobian dh maps tangentspaces in T\u03beR n onto tangent-spaces T\u03b3R n of the conjugated orbit xs(\u03c4) \u2208 \u03b3. From proposition 4.2, T\u03beRn \u2208 B\u22a5, and tangent-spaces along \u03be are all spanned by orthogonal basis-vectors. The N-OSC tangent-bundle (see section 3.2) will be orthogonal, T\u03b3R\nn \u2208 B\u22a5, if, and only if, the Jacobian is angle-preserving (conformal) at all points of \u03be. This implies that dh(ys(\u03c4)) \u2208 CO(n) must hold for all \u03c4 where we let CO(n) be the set of all n \u00d7 n conformal matrices. By definition, h \u2223 \u2223\n\u03be is then conformal.\nLet H be the set of all conjugation maps. The subset HC \u2282 H, and the conjugation operator c\u223c, are then defined as\nHC = {h \u2208 H : h \u2223 \u2223 \u03be is conformal} c\u223ch :=\u223ch \u2227 h \u2208 HC (12)\nand c\u223c is simply \u223c with the extra condition that the conjugation map, h, belongs to HC (conformal restriction). It can be shown that c\u223c is an equivalence operator10. We can then re-state proposition 4.3\nProposition 4.4 (proposition 4.3 re-stated). Let o \u2208 O\u22a5 be the PNF-OSC on U. Then q \u2208 O\u22a5 \u21d4 o c\u223c q.\nProof. Follows directly from proposition 4.3 and the definitions in eq. (12).\nLet us briefly explain this result. Assuming the PNF-OSC, o = (\u03c8\u03c4 , \u03be), on U, is used as a parametrization template. Proposition 4.4 then says that, in-order for q = (\u03c6\u03c4 , \u03b3) on Ws to be an OFD oscillator, there must exist a conjugation map h, with a conformal restriction on \u03be (i.e. h \u2208 HC) such that o c\u223ch q (and not just the standard o \u223ch q). 10simply apply footnote 8 plus the fact the composition preserves the conformal property meaning that s \u25e6 p is conformal if, and only if, both s and p are conformal."

For every conformal restriction, h \u2223 \u2223 \u03be , at-least one conformal map, \u03bd : \u0393\u03be \u2192 \u0393\u03b3 , must exist; i.e. simply continue the power-series expansion of the restriction h \u2223 \u2223\n\u03be , around \u03be, in every possible way that keeps \u03bd conformal. Let\nH = h\u2212 \u03bd denote the residual. By definition this residual is non-conformal on \u03be since all conformal contributions are contained in \u03bd. It then follows directly11 that H(\u03be) = 0.\nThe following statement discuss the possible forms the conformal map \u03bd, in proposition 5.1, can take\nProposition 5.2. Any conformal conjugation map \u03bd : \u0393\u03be \u2192 \u0393\u03b3 , must have the form\n\u03bd(y) = \u03c1Ay (14)\nwhere \u03c1 \u2208 R \\ {0} is a non-zero real value and A \u2208 O(n) is an orthogonal matrix.\nProof. For n > 2 this is a direct consequence of Liouville\u2019s theorem (1850) [19\u201323]. This theorem states that all conformal maps on an open region of Rn, with n > 2, must be M\u00f6bius transformations of the form \u03bd(y) = b + \u03c1A(y \u2212 a)/|y \u2212 a|s, with a, b \u2208 Rn, \u03c1 \u2208 R, A \u2208 O(n) and the integer exponent s is either 0 or 2. We first consider the case s = 2. This map will have a singularity at y = a. From the discussion in section 4.1, the conjugation-map transform orbits into orbits (see eq. (7)). This singularity would hence imply that orbits around y = awould be mapped to orbits around infinity; clearly not a possibility. Hence we must have s = 0 which implies a map \u03bd(y) = d + \u03c1Ay where d = b \u2212 \u03c1Aa is a real parameter. Both oscillators are assumed to have fixed-points at the origin (see sections 3 and 4 and footnotes 7 and 11) and we hence must have \u03bd(0) = 0 which implies d = 0 and we reached eq. (14). For the special planar case, n = 2, \u03bd is a bi-holomorphic map on the annuli \u0393\u03be . Schottkys Theorem (1877) [18] states that the map must have the form k(z) = az\u00b11 where a \u2208 C \\ {0}. Again, since singularities are not allowed and we must have k(0) = 0 this implies the map k(z) = az. Equation (14) is then reached by transforming from complex to real coordinates in the plane.\nAt this point we define the set of rotational symmetric curves centered at the origin and with radius r, on Ws\nSYMn = { x \u2208 Rn, \u2203r \u2208 R+ : \u2016x\u2016 \u2212 r = 0 }\n(15)\nFrom eq. (11), the PNF-OSC limit-cycle belongs to this set, \u03be \u2208 SYMn. This fact allow us to state the main result of this paper\nTheorem 5.1. Let q = (\u03c6\u03c4 , \u03b3) \u2208 O be any given oscillator on Ws. Then\nq \u2208 O\u22a5 \u21d2 \u03b3 \u2208 SYMn (16) 11Here H \u2223 \u2223\n\u03be = H(\u03be) is non-conformal and dH\n\u2223 \u2223\n\u03be /\u2208 CO(n). Then h = \u03bd +H \u2208 HC if, and only if, dH is zero everywhere on \u03be.\nBut this implies that H must be constant on \u03be, meaning H(\u03be) = c for some scalar c \u2208 Rn. Here the map, H(\u03be) = c, represent a constant translation of the full conjugation map, h(y) = \u03bd(y)+H(y), which is irrelevant as the dynamics invariant under constant translations (see section 3 and footnote 7). Hence c can be any value w/o changing the outcome of the analysis and we choose c = 0 which keeps the singular/fixed-point of the oscillator at the origin.\nProof. From proposition 4.4 we must have o c\u223c q where o = (\u03c8\u03c4 , \u03be) is the PNF-OSC described in section 4.2. This implies that the conjugation map, h, must belong to the set, HC, defined in eq. (12). From proposition 5.1, this implies a conjugation map of the form h(y) = \u03bd(y) + H(y) with h(\u03be) = \u03bd(\u03be). Proposition 5.2 and eq. (9) then yield \u03b3 = h(\u03be) = \u03bd(\u03be) = \u03c1Ay , with y \u2208 \u03be. This describes a linear rotation + scaling of \u03be which implies \u03be \u2208 SYMn \u21d2 \u03b3 = h(\u03be) \u2208 SYMn, as linear rotation + scaling preserves symmetry of \u03be \u2208 SYMn (i.e. maps SYMn into SYMn).\nFirstly, it is important to note that the result in theorem 5.1 represents a one-way implication. In other words, the OFD property implies PSS symmetry. No reverse relation exists as discussed, at length, in the introduction; i.e. symmetry does not imply an OFD. Secondly, the result, implicitly, also hold for symmetric limits-sets on Ws with center away from the origin even-though SYMn in eq. (15) seem to include this restriction\n12. Theorem 5.1 explains why OFD\u2019s generally are not observed in real-life oscillator systems where non-linear device-models make it impossible to attain perfect PSS symmetry. The methodology developed in the previous sections, leading to the main result in theorem 5.1, is given the SYM-OFD calling handle; signifying the (one-way) relation between PSS symmetry and LR OFD described in theorem 5.1."

Luckily, because c\u223c is an equivalence relation (see eq. (12) and footnote 10), this turns out not to be an issue.

The statement in theorem 5.1 is hence independent of the choice of normal-form (NF-OSC) and hence unique. Or said another way : eq. (17) shows that the XNF-OSC, x, and the PNF-OSC, o, give the same OFD classification of the N-OSC, q.\nThe range of an equivalence relation, i.e. the types of oscillators which can be parameterized, is limited by the topological invariants. Each set of invariant values defines a unique equivalence class which is preserved under conjugation [27,28]. The invariants do not change under conjugation and it follows that a oscillators in one equivalence class (defined in-terms of one sets of invariants) cannot parameterize a system in a different class; as this would correspond to a different set of invariants. For hyperbolic oscillators, on identical domains U = Ws, the only invariant of importance is the M-MATRIX stability measure characterized in-terms of the NF-OSC M-MATRIX eigenvaluespectrum13, spec{\u03a8}. From proposition 4.2 and appendix A, the PNF-OSC was specifically designed such that all possible M-MATRIX eigenvalue-spectra can be modelled, i.e any combination of {\u03bbi}ni=1, inside the unit-circle on the complex plane (|\u03bbi| \u2264 1 for stable oscillators), and this model is hence able to parameterize all oscillators on Ws. The results derived herein are thus fully independent of the specific choice NF-OSC model. The PNF-OSC model was only chosen in-order to facilitate the analysis leading to theorem 5.1. We could easily have chosen any other equivalent model and would have arrived at the exact same result. The equivalence topics discussed herein are well-known concepts developed within the field of topological conjugation theory; a mature and established branch of modern dynamical systems theory. The SYM-OFD model, and specifically theorem 5.1, is hence based on an extremely rigorous foundation of theoretical research which stretches back several decades [18\u201323, 27\u201335]."

These types of polynomial functions, discussed here, are readily implemented electrically using e.g. standard operational amplifiers (op-amp) circuits, operational trans-conductance amplifiers (OTA) or dedicated chips. We will not dwell on this practical implementation issue here as this topic is not critical for the discussion below.

The circuit includes both an option for parallel (blue) and series (red) resonator resistance topology. In the simulations below the FET differentialpair circuit is modelled in-terms of the trans-conductance function \u0398(\u03b6) = IB(2/\u03c0) arctan([\u03c0/2](Gm/IB)\u03b6) which\n12this is because a non-zero center for \u03b3, on Ws, can always brought back to the origin through a simple linear translation which leaves the dynamics un-changed. This linear translation, as was explained in section 3 (see also footnote 7), is assumed a-priori to analysis. Hence the location of the limit-cycle center is irrelevant; only symmetry is important.\n13expanding the conjugation relation eq. (6), around \u03be, in a power-series, using eq. (9) and excluding higher-order terms gives the expression dh(u\u03c4 ) \u25e6 d\u03c8\u03c4 (u0) = d\u03c6\u03c4 \u25e6 dh(u0). Setting \u03c4 = 2\u03c0 and using the notation for the M-MATRIX introduced in section 3.2 i.e. \u03a8 = d\u03c82\u03c0 , \u03a6 = d\u03c62\u03c0 , we get \u03a6 = dh(u0) \u25e6\u03a8 \u25e6 dh(u0)\n\u22121 where u0 = u2\u03c0 for u0, u2\u03c0 \u2208 \u03be, was used.

From inspection14 it should be clear that \u039b in measures the closeness of the limit-cycle \u03b3 on Ws to members of the set SYMn in eq. (15) whereas \u03a5 measures the closeness of a N-OSC solution, q \u2208 O, to a member of the special OFD oscillator class O\u22a5 defined in eq. (4).\nRemark 6.1. From eq.

From the insets in this figure, the PSS is seen to approach an elliptical limit-set as \u01eb\u2192 0 for all values of c0 except for the value c0 = 1. The exception, c0 = 1.0, approaches a rotational symmetric set \u03b3 \u2208 SYM2 (see eq. (15)). From remark 6.1, we need to see that \u03a5 \u2192 0, implies, c0 = 1; exactly because \u039b \u2192 0, as \u01eb \u2192 0, only for c0 = 1. Inspecting fig. 7 this is indeed the case."

The figures illustrate how the PSS symmetry can be increased/descreased by varying the circuit parameters defined in connection with eqs. (18) and (19). Once the PSS has been calculated, the measure, \u039b, is readily calculated from eq. (20). Based on this PSS, the Floquet modes {ui(\u03c4), vi(\u03c4), \u00b5i} are derived by integrating the LR equations corresponding to this solution [1, 2, 4] (see also section 3.2) and the measure, \u03a5, follows from eq. (20).\n14from eq. (15), \u03c1 is a constant/scalar function for \u03b3 \u2208 SYMn. If \u03c1 is constant then eq. (20) gives \u039b = 0 which implies \u03b3 \u2208 SYMn \u21d2 \u039b = 0. Likewise, since the integrand is strictly negative or zero the only way \u039b can be zero is if \u03c1 is a constant scalar function which directly implies \u03b3 \u2208 SYMn. Hence, \u039b = 0 \u21d2 \u03b3 \u2208 SYMn and we have derived \u03b3 \u2208 SYMn \u21d4 \u039b = 0. \u03a5 directly measures the maximum deviation, away from 90\u25e6, of the various angles between modes and hence the closeness of the solution to the OFD oscillator class O\u22a5 (see eq. (4)).\nConsidering the TRC-OSC circuit in fig. 6.(a), the two measures are calculated, as explained above, while sweeping circuit parameters (z0, \u03b1, \u03b2). Figure 9 (upper row) depicts contour plots for the two measures \u039b,\u03a5 as functions of turn-ratios \u03b1, \u03b2 swept in the interval [0.1; 2.0] \u00d7 [0.1; 2.0]. Inspecting these two images one immediate observation is that the pattern of the contours appear very similar. This suspicion is then directly confirmed in fig. 9.(c) which plots the points in these two figures against each other as a scatter-plot format. It is strikingly clear from this plot that the measures are very strongly correlated. The figure furthermore reveals the relationship \u03a5 \u2192 0 \u21d2 \u039b \u2192 0 (\u2212\u221e on dB scale) and from remark 6.1 this observation therefore directly serves to validate the novel SYM-OFD model derived herein. In the lower row of fig. 9 these same simulations are repeated but this time \u03b1, z0 are swept in the range [0.1; 2.0]\u00d7 [0.3; 5.0]. The figure again shows the measures obeying the predictions laid out in remark 6.1 and hence again serve to validate the model. Finally, fig. 10 shows two equivalent simulation sweeps for the FET-OSC circuit in fig. 6.(b) with both figures serving to validate the novel SYM-OFD model developed herein."

Inspecting, fig. 7 and the 2-D contour plots + scatter plots in figs. 9 and 10 it is clear that these two properties are closely correlated, i.e. orthogonality increases \u21d2 symmetry increases; as was first predicted in theorem 5.1. It is important to note that this idea is completely novel. There is absolutely nothing in the definition of symmetry/orthogonality measures \u039b,\u03a5 in eq.

This novel link connecting the configuration of a Floquet decomposition with symmetry properties of the underlying steady-state is a novel concept which, to our knowledge, is first discussed here for the general case. Our results can be interpreted as a condition for the leaves of the oscillator isochrone foliation to intersect the limit-cycle set orthogonally.
