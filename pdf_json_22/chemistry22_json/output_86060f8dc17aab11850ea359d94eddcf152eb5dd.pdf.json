    "abstractText": "In spite of the valuable perspective on rapid accessing \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino acid derivatives, a three-component reaction of diazo compounds, amines and allyl esters remains as an unexplored challenge, probably because of the foreseeable side reactions arising from each two reactants. In this work, we describe a novel Xantphos-containing dinuclear palladium complex enabled geminal aminoallylation of diazocarbonyl compounds, which provides a range of quaternary \u03b1amino esters selectively. Direct N-H insertion, allylic alkylation of amino nucleophiles and diene formation were not observed under standard conditions. Mechanistic studies indicated that the Xantphos-containing palladium complex with a Pd/P ratio of 1/1 was optimal to enable the reaction to achieve high selectivity. A relayed pathway via allylation of N-H insertion product or [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of a ylide intermediate was unlikely. We believe that the current strategy on palladiumcatalyzed selective carbene difunctionalization could be general to construct quaternary carbon centers, and inspire more transformations in related field.",

The replacement of \u03b1-proton with an alkyl group results in increased stability of the corresponding \u03b1-amino acid towards hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation, while maintaining the activities on recognizing and binding with the receptor on the cell membrane.1 These properties have motivated extensive research interests on development of concise methods for their efficient preparation. 2-14\nN-H insertion of a donor-acceptor carbene intermediate is versatile for accessing \u03b1-mono substituted \u03b1-amino acid derivatives (Scheme 1a, left)15-24. Hu and others developed elegant approaches on trapping ammonium ylides by suitable electrophiles (Scheme 1a, right).25-27 In spite of their high efficiency, the development of a facile and mechanistic distinct synthetic route to access these valuable compounds is still in high demand. To our knowledge, palladium-catalyzed three-component amination and alkylation of carbenic carbon center, which could lead to fully substituted \u03b1amino acid derivatives, is hitherto unknown.\nScheme 1.

            "text": "In line with our research interests in diazo chemistry2839,40-50, we wonder whether a cascade reaction on amination and allylic alkylation of a transient palladium carbene51-60 intermediate could take place. If such a three-componentreaction is feasible, compounds embedded with \u03b1,\u03b1-\ndisubstituted \u03b1-amino acid motif could also prepared in a modular manner61 (Scheme 1b). It is envisioned that the palladium(II) intermediate generated in situ would promote the decomposition of donor-acceptor type diazo compound to form a palladium carbene intermediate. Ideally, the establishment of an effective catalytic system would lead to selective formation of \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino acid derivatives.\nWhile the above strategy could be viewed as an attractive approach to prepare \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino acid derivatives, several potential obstacles are foreseeable (Scheme 1c). First, \u03b1-mono substituted \u03b1-amino ester may be produced via N-H insertion reaction.19,22 Second, a direct allylic alkylation of the amino nucleophile could potentially lead to the formation of allylic amine. Third, formal C-O bond insertion of allylic ester to diazo compound could give \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-oxygenated ester.62 Fourth, a competing pathway through \u03b2-hydride elimination of palladium intermediate C to form diene may override the requisite C-N bond reductive elimination.63-66 Therefore, achieving selective formation of \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino esters through palladium-catalyzed three-component coupling of allyl esters, amines and aryl diazo esters still remains an unexplored challenge. Herein, we describe our preliminary results on execution of this three-component aminoallylation.67"

            "text": "To initiate our study, a palladium-catalyzed three-component reaction of N-methylaniline 1a, methyl 2-diazo-2-phenylacetate 2a and allyl acetate 3a was tested to verify our hypothesis. As expected, to achieve selective aminoallylation of 2a is rather challenging. As can be seen from the results compiled in Table 1, the ligands employed were crucial for the chemoselectivity. When the reaction was carried out in the reaction media of ethyl acetate at 90 oC, K2CO3 was employed as the base, [Pd(allyl)Cl]2 was selected as the palladium source, and triphenyl phosphine (L1) was selected as the ligand, product 4a was indeed observed with a GC yield of 16%, but favouring the formation of N-H insertion type adduct 5a (Table 1, entry 1). The reaction using tris(4methoxyphenyl)phosphine (L2) or dppm (L3) as the ligand gave allylic amine 6a as the major product (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). Further experiments on testing the effects of ligands (Table 1, entries 4-7) revealed that the catalyst employing Xantphos (L6) as ligand could alter the selectivity, leading to the formation of 4a in 53% GC yield (Table 1, entry 6). A brief examination of base and the reaction media led to the discovery of a set of condition that favoured the formation of 4a over 5a and 6a with a ratio of 21:1:5 (Table 1, entry 14). A pre-reaction of palladium salt with ligand L6 in DCM at room temperature was beneficial. The yield of 4a could be enhanced to 65% upon isolation (Table 1, entry 15). Pleasingly, the N-H insertion and allylic amination reaction were almost supressed, when diazo compound 2a and allyl ester 3a were added to the reaction mixture at 0 oC, and the aminoallylation product 4a was isolated in 92% yield (Table 1, entry 16). Altering the ratio of 1a, 2a and 3a to 1:1.5:2.5, or lowering the loading of the catalyst, high selectivity and efficiency were maintained (Table 1, entries 17 and 18). Several chiral ligands were also examined under otherwise identical conditions; however, no promising outcomes were obtained at present.68"

            "text": "Substrate scope. With a set of conditions for selective aminoallylation of diazo compound 2a established, we then explored the substrate scope with respect to the amination reagents 1 (Table 2). As can be seen, a variety of disubstituted aniline analogues could participate in current three-\ncomponent reaction well. Beside methyl group, anilines bearing other groups on the nitrogen atom, including phenyl, benzyl or substituted benzyl groups, could act as amination reagents to react with diazo compound 2a and allyl acetate 3a, giving corresponding aminoallylation products in high yields (4a-4e, 4r and 4s, 78-97%). When ethane-1,2diamine derivative 1d was employed, the reaction was selectively taking place at aniline site, leaving the Boc protected amine moiety intact, and the aminoallylation product 4d was obtained in 92% yield upon isolation. Electron-varied substituents on the phenyl ring were well tolerated and gave the corresponding products (4f-4l) in moderate to excellent yields (60-96%). Functional groups including halogens, ester and amide were compatible and delivered a range of \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino esters successfully, which provided synthetic handles for further downstream synthetic applications. Indole, carbazole, indoline, tetrahydroquinoline and dihydroacridine were viable amination reagents, and the corresponding \u03b1-amino esters with fully substituted carbon centers were obtained in moderate to excellent yields (4p-4t, 45-95%).\nTo our delight, free aniline could also be employed as amination reagent under slightly modified conditions. As depicted, replacing the ligand with CyDEPhos ((oxybis(2,1-\nphenylene))bis(dicyclohexylphosphane)), and enhancement the mount of K2CO3 to 3.0 equiv., the desired adduct 4w was obtained in 59% isolated yield after purification by column chromatography. Similarly, functional moieties like bromo, chloro, nitro, ester, ketone, trifluoromethyl and cyano groups were tolerated; the corresponding aminoallylation products (4x-4ad) were obtained from 57% to 85% yields. Aniline containing a coumarin scaffold could react with 2a and 3a as well, and the desired product 4ae was isolated in 61% yield.\nNext, the generality and limitation of diazo compounds 2 were examined (Table 3). Aryl diazoesters bearing chloro (4af, 4an and 4aq) fluoro (4am and 4ao) and ester (4ai) groups at the para or meta position on the benzene ring could react with benzyl substituted aniline 1b and 3a smoothly, giving the corresponding difunctionalized products in 49% to 99% yields. Setting a chloro group at ortho position of the phenyl ring resulted in a sluggish reaction, which was probably attributed to steric hindrance nature of the corresponding diazo ester. A bromo group decorating on the benzene ring was not compatible under current conditions (4ag). Sulfoxide, which proved to be apt to react with transition metal carbene intermediate, was also tolerated (4ap). It was found that the outcome of the reaction was marginally affected the electron-donating nature of the groups on the phenyl rings of the aryl diazoesters. As depicted, the reactions of diazo compounds bearing methoxyl and thiomethyl groups gave the desired products in low yields (4aj, 4ak and 4ar). Pleasingly, aryl diazoester derived from isoxepac was a competent substrate, which could react with 1b and 3a, giving the corresponding amino ester 4as in nearly quantitative yield. We have also examined the reactivity of diazo compounds containing other esters groups, and these reactions provided the corresponding products in 63% (4at), 85% (4au) and 93% (4av) isolated yields, respectively. Simple ethyl diazoester without an aryl group was not compatible to react to furnish the corresponding aminoallylation product under standard conditions. The reaction of allylic acetate bearing a methyl group on the alkene moiety could\nalso proceed well, giving 4aw in 73% yield upon isolation. The reaction of acetate 3 containing internal allylic ester group failed to give 4 under current conditions.\nAfter identifying a set of condition for aminoallylation of aryl diazoesters, a challenging thioallylation was tested subsequently (Table 4). A brief examination of various thiophenols revealed that para-methoxylthiophenol was an excellent substrate for the desired transformation, and gave the \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted thioester 7a in 93% isolated yield. By contrast, unsubstituted thiophenol could also react, but gave the corresponding product 7b in diminished yield. The major by-product was arising from the formal C-O bond insertion of allyl acetate 3a to the palladium carbene intermediate, which led to oxylallylation of carbenic carbon center. Diazo ester derived from isoxepac was also thioallylated successfully, giving the desired product 7c in 81% isolated yield. Diazo compound containing a trifluoroethyl ester moiety was viable substrate as well, and the corresponding product 7d was isolated in 65% yield."

            "text": "Further experiments were conducted to shed light on the reaction mechanism. First, N-H insertion type product 5b could not convert to 4b by reacting with 3a under standard conditions (Scheme 2a). Second, compound 8 was prepared and subjected to the standard conditions to react with 1b. However, no conversions of both 8 and 1b were observed (Scheme 2b). These results suggested that potential side products 5 and 8 were not reaction intermediates for 4. Moreover, the reaction of allylic amine 6a with diazo compound 2a could not give 4a (Scheme 2c), which also indicated that 6a was not an intermediate to produce 4a. This observation further suggests a reaction path through [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement69-71 of ammonium ylides was unlikely. Interestingly, the reaction of sulfide 9 with 2a gave 7a but in a much lower yield than three-component thioallylation reaction under standard conditions (Scheme 2d).\nScheme 2. Mechanistic Experiments.\nTo get more information on the palladium catalyst, the stoichiometric reaction of Xantphos with [Pd(allyl)Cl]2 was monitored by NMR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, treatment of [Pd(allyl)Cl]2 with one equivalent of Xantphos in DCM led to selective formation of a dinuclear palladium complex 10.72- 74 Although this complex was proved to be air and moisture sensitive, we were able to obtain a crystal in high quality under an atmosphere of argon. The structure of 10 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, in which one of the palladium atoms coordinated to both arms of the bidentate phosphine ligand (Scheme 3a). The benefit on pre-reaction of [Pd(allyl)Cl]2 with Xantphos may highlight the positive effects of 10 on selective formation of 4a. Given the fact that the reactions using Pd2(dba)3\u2022CHCl3 or Pd(PPh3)4 as palladium sources gave negligible amount of target adduct 4a,68 we were thinking about the possibility whether 10 was a precursor to generate Pd(I) species. In this regard, we tried to prepare a potential Pd(I) complex containing Xantphos ligand. A Pd(0) complex 11 was generated in situ75,76, and then it was treated with [Pd(allyl)Cl]2 (with 1:1 ratio of Pd/P in whole). Interestingly, complex 10 was obtained as main product, together with precipitation of small amount palladium black species (Scheme 3b).\nScheme 3. Mechanistic studies on palladium complexes.\nSince we were unable to obtain a stable Pd(I) complex from 10, the reactivity of a number of well-defined dinuclear Pd(I) complexes 12-16 were tested for current threecomponent reaction. As can be seen, complex 10 has proved to be competent for this three-component reaction (Table 5, entry 1). The reactions catalyzed by palladium(I) dimers 12 or 13 were unselective for the formation of 4a (Table 5, entries 2 and 3). Delightfully, a catalyst generated from\ncationic complex 14 and Xantphos (Pd/P = 1/1) was capable of inducing the selective formation of 4a, which was obtained in 65% yield upon isolation (Table 5, entry 4). When the reaction was carried out in a more concentrated solution, the yield of 4a could be enhanced to 84% (Table 4, entry 6). By contrast, palladium(I) complex 15 bearing two Xantphos ligands was inactive to produce 4a (Table 5, entry 5). A catalyst generated from palladium(I) dimer 16 bearing transient COD ligand was also competent for selective aminoallylation reaction, and 4a was isolated in 91% yield (Table 5, entry 7). Interestingly, well-defined palladium(II) complex 17 could also enable the three-component reaction to occur, giving 4a in 67% isolated yield (Table 5, entry 8). These results suggest that the reactions enabled by palladium complexes 14 (Table 5, entry 6) and 16 (Table 5, entry 7) with Xantphos ligand may have similar reaction profiles to the one with complex 10, and a common palladium(II) species akin to 17 was produced within the catalytic cycle."

            "text": "a The reaction was run in DCM (1.5 mL). Although an exact pathway is not clear at present, based on the results obtained above and previous report, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed (Scheme 4). Taking aminoallylation for example, an active catalyst was produced in situ from complex 10, and the catalytic cycle started with oxidative addition of low valent palladium catalyst to allyl acetate 3a to generate a \u03c0-allyl palladium intermediate I, which might be embeded with a similar core structure as 17. I could further react with diazo compound 2a to produce a palladium carbene intermediate II. Displacement of acetate anion with by an external nucleophile 1a would furnish another carbene intermediate III, which might undergo migratory insertion to produce intermediate IV or IV\u2019. Reductive elimination would eventually give the final aminoallylation product 4a with the concomitant regeneration of the active palladium catalyst to enter the next cycle. A related reaction path could dominate for thioallylation reaction, since a significant low yield of 7a was obtained from the reaction of 9 and 2a. As depicted, the difficulties on selective formation of 4a is\nagain highlighted by other potential facile side reactions: (1) direct reaction of intermediate I with 1a to generate 6a (arrow a); (2) alkoxylation/allylation takes place from palladium carbene intermediate II (arrow b)62; (3) \u03b2hydride elimination from intermediate IV or IV\u2019 to form NH insertion type side-product 5a (arrow c) or diene type side-product (arrow d)63-66.\nScheme 4.
