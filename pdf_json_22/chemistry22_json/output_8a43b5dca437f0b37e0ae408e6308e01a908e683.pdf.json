\u00a0various \u00a0diseases, \u00a0showing \u00a0that \u00a0peptide \u00a0drugs \u00a0have \u00a0 gained \u00a0 astounding \u00a0 interest \u00a0 in \u00a0 pharmaceutical \u00a0 industry.1\u20133 \u00a0 As \u00a0 one \u00a0 type \u00a0 of \u00a0 drug \u00a0 entities, \u00a0 peptides \u00a0 have \u00a0 medium \u00a0 molecular \u00a0 weights \u00a0 between \u00a0 small \u00a0 molecules \u00a0

\u00a0in \u00a0peptide \u00a0delivery \u00a0technology.1 \u00a0Moreover, \u00a0 small \u00a0 peptides \u00a0 are \u00a0 rather \u00a0 flexible \u00a0 and \u00a0 only \u00a0 rarely \u00a0 adopt \u00a0 stable \u00a0 conformations, \u00a0 which \u00a0 may \u00a0 preclude \u00a0 their \u00a0 ability \u00a0 to \u00a0 interact \u00a0 with \u00a0 protein \u00a0 targets \u00a0 or \u00a0 to \u00a0 inhibit \u00a0 protein-\u2010protein \u00a0 interactions \u00a0 (PPIs), \u00a0 which \u00a0 involve \u00a0 generally \u00a0 well-\u2010defined \u00a0 secondary \u00a0 structures \u00a0 in \u00a0 the \u00a0 hot-\u2010spot \u00a0 sequences \u00a0 of \u00a0 interaction. \u00a0 Modified \u00a0 peptides \u00a0 and \u00a0 peptidomimetics \u00a0represent \u00a0an \u00a0alternative \u00a0to \u00a0avoid \u00a0these \u00a0limitations \u00a0 of \u00a0peptides.4 \u00a0The \u00a0 field \u00a0of \u00a0peptide-\u2010based \u00a0 foldamers \u00a0adopting \u00a0stable \u00a0 conformations \u00a0 able \u00a0 to \u00a0 mimic \u00a0 secondary \u00a0 structures \u00a0 represent \u00a0 also \u00a0 recent \u00a0 promising \u00a0 therapeutic \u00a0 opportunities \u00a0 in \u00a0 particular \u00a0 to \u00a0 target \u00a0 PPIs.5,6 \u00a0\nAzapeptides \u00a0 represent \u00a0 one \u00a0 type \u00a0 of \u00a0 peptidomimetics \u00a0 in \u00a0 which \u00a0 one \u00a0or \u00a0more \u00a0of \u00a0the

peptides \u00a0 containing \u00a0 a \u00a0 single \u00a0 aza-\u2010amino \u00a0 acid \u00a0 adopt \u00a0 a \u00a0 \u03b2-\u2010turn \u00a0 structure.12\u201317 \u00a0 It \u00a0 has \u00a0 also \u00a0 been \u00a0 demonstrated \u00a0 that \u00a0 this \u00a0 non-\u2010extended \u00a0 structure \u00a0 can \u00a0 disrupt \u00a0 the \u00a0 \u03b2-\u2010hairpin \u00a0 conformation \u00a0 of \u00a0 peptides \u00a0 even \u00a0 containing \u00a0 a \u00a0 D-\u2010Pro-\u2010Gly \u00a0 template \u00a0 in \u00a0 their \u00a0 sequence.18 \u00a0 The \u00a0 few \u00a0 reported \u00a0 computational \u00a0

\u00a0 have \u00a0 shown \u00a0 that \u00a0 this \u00a0 class \u00a0 usually \u00a0 adopts \u00a0 a \u00a0 type \u00a0 II \u00a0 \u03b2-\u2010turn \u00a0 conformation \u00a0 in \u00a0 solid-\u2010state \u00a0 or \u00a0 in \u00a0 organic \u00a0 solvent \u00a0 (CDCl3 \u00a0 or \u00a0 DMSO).\n15,16,19,20 \u00a0 However, \u00a0 only \u00a0 non-\u2010 classical \u00a0 azapeptides \u00a0

\u00a0 sequential \u00a0 aza-\u2010amino \u00a0acids \u00a0has \u00a0been \u00a0reported \u00a0so \u00a0far.22,23 \u00a0In \u00a0this \u00a0conformational \u00a0 study, \u00a0 we \u00a0 observed \u00a0 that \u00a0 diaza-\u2010tripeptide \u00a0 1 \u00a0 containing \u00a0 two \u00a0 aza-\u2010 amino \u00a0acids \u00a0at \u00a0its \u00a0N-\u2010terminus \u00a0(aza/aza/\u03b1 \u00a0pseudotripeptide, \u00a0Fig. \u00a01) \u00a0is \u00a0 prone \u00a0 to \u00a0adopt \u00a0a \u00a0 single \u00a0 type \u00a0 I \u00a0\u03b2-\u2010turn \u00a0or \u00a0 two \u00a0consecutive \u00a0 type \u00a0 I \u00a0\u03b2-\u2010 turn \u00a0 conformations \u00a0 in \u00a0 methanol,23 \u00a0 whereas \u00a0 the \u00a0 corresponding \u00a0 natural \u00a0 tripeptide \u00a0 shows \u00a0 highly \u00a0 disordered \u00a0 conformation. \u00a0 We \u00a0 exploited \u00a0 this \u00a0 property \u00a0 to \u00a0 synthesize \u00a0 the \u00a0 aza/aza/\u03b1/aza/aza/\u03b1 \u00a0 pseudohexapeptide \u00a02 \u00a0 composed \u00a0of \u00a0 two \u00a0diaza-\u2010tripeptide \u00a0units \u00a0 (Fig. \u00a0 1) which \u00a0was \u00a0shown \u00a0to \u00a0adopt \u00a0highly \u00a0folded \u00a0conformations \u00a0made \u00a0of repeated \u00a0 \u03b2-\u2010turn \u00a0 conformations \u00a0 or \u00a0 even \u00a0 a \u00a0 full-\u2010length \u00a0 310-\u2010helix \u00a0 structure. \u00a0 This \u00a0 suggests \u00a0 that \u00a0 the \u00a0 repeat \u00a0mode \u00a0aza/aza/\u03b1 \u00a0 in \u00a0 longer \u00a0 peptide \u00a0 sequences \u00a0 has \u00a0 the \u00a0 propensity \u00a0 to \u00a0 induce \u00a0 helical \u00a0 structuration \u00a0 in \u00a0 peptides. \u00a0 Notably, \u00a0we \u00a0 found \u00a0 that \u00a0 the \u00a0 insertion \u00a0 of \u00a0 side \u00a0 chains \u00a0 on \u00a0 both \u00a0 aza-\u2010amino \u00a0 acids \u00a0 had \u00a0 a \u00a0 beneficial \u00a0 effect \u00a0 to \u00a0 stabilize \u00a0 the \u00a0 turn \u00a0 conformation \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 diaza-\u2010tripeptides. \u00a0 Indeed, \u00a0 diaza-\u2010tripeptide \u00a03 \u00a0with \u00a0two \u00a0azaGly \u00a0at \u00a0its \u00a0N-\u2010terminus \u00a0(Fig. \u00a01) \u00a0showed \u00a0 higher \u00a0conformational \u00a0flexibility \u00a0by \u00a0NMR \u00a0and \u00a0MM/DFT \u00a0calculations \u00a0 than \u00a0diaza-\u2010tripeptide \u00a01 \u00a0bearing \u00a0azaVal-\u2010azaAla, \u00a0oscillating \u00a0from \u00a0a \u00a0few \u00a0 helical \u00a0 populations \u00a0 to \u00a0 extended \u00a0 structures. \u00a0 On \u00a0 the \u00a0 basis \u00a0 of \u00a0 these \u00a0 findings, \u00a0 we \u00a0 have \u00a0 the \u00a0 aim \u00a0 to \u00a0 use \u00a0 these \u00a0 diaza-\u2010peptide \u00a0 units \u00a0 in \u00a0 peptidomimetic \u00a0 foldamers \u00a0 targeting \u00a0

further \u00a0 investigate \u00a0 two \u00a0new \u00a0factors: \u00a0 (1) \u00a0 the \u00a0ability \u00a0of \u00a0 these \u00a0 units \u00a0to \u00a0retain \u00a0their \u00a0turn \u00a0propensity \u00a0in \u00a0water, \u00a0which \u00a0is \u00a0an \u00a0even \u00a0more \u00a0 challenging \u00a0 solvent \u00a0 than \u00a0 methanol \u00a0 for \u00a0 maintaining \u00a0 intramolecular \u00a0 hydrogen \u00a0 bonding \u00a0 and \u00a0 stable \u00a0 conformations, \u00a0 because \u00a0 solubility \u00a0 in \u00a0 water \u00a0is \u00a0mandatory \u00a0for \u00a0biological \u00a0evaluations; \u00a0and \u00a0(2) \u00a0the \u00a0influence \u00a0\nof \u00a0 the \u00a0 nature \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 side \u00a0 chain \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 aza-\u2010amino \u00a0 acid \u00a0 residues \u00a0 on \u00a0 the \u00a0conformation. \u00a0 \u00a0\nBecause \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0low \u00a0aqueous \u00a0solubility \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0diaza-\u2010tripeptides \u00a01 \u00a0 and \u00a0 2 \u00a0 mentioned \u00a0 above, \u00a0 their \u00a0 NMR \u00a0 analysis \u00a0 in \u00a0 water \u00a0 was \u00a0 not \u00a0 possible. \u00a0Herein \u00a0we \u00a0propose \u00a0to \u00a0introduce

\u00a0 the \u00a0 target \u00a0 diaza-\u2010tripeptides, \u00a0 thereby \u00a0 making \u00a0 possible \u00a0 their \u00a0 NMR \u00a0 analysis \u00a0in \u00a0water. \u00a0Thus, \u00a0azaLys \u00a0was

\u00a0be \u00a0a \u00a0source \u00a0 of \u00a0 conformational \u00a0 isomerism. \u00a0 In \u00a0 the \u00a0 case \u00a0 of \u00a0 N-\u2010terminal \u00a0 acetyl \u00a0 groups \u00a0 preceding \u00a0

the \u00a0 case \u00a0of \u00a0diaza-\u2010tripeptides \u00a05 \u00a0 and \u00a06 \u00a0 could \u00a0 be \u00a0 explained \u00a0 by \u00a0 the \u00a0 restricted \u00a0 pyramidal \u00a0 inversion
