There is no single cause of reason, and it can result from a complex multifactorial interaction. However, most suicides are preventable1. More than 700,000 people die globally due to suicide every year, which means that every 40 s a person dies. In 2016, the Word Health Organization (WHO) found that suicide was the fourth leading cause of death among young people aged 15\u201329 years. About 77% of suicides in the world occur in lowand middle-income countries2. It is a phenomenon with great relevance to public health, due to its magnitude, the seriousness of the cases, hospitalizations and sequelae, and emotional damage caused to the victims and their families, thereby causing numerous psychological, social, and economic problems3. Suicide can be understood as a deliberate act that is performed by the individual, whose main intention is death, consciously and intentionally, even if ambivalent, using means or method that the individual believes to be lethal4,5. The Brazilian population has been showing a prevalence of suicidal behavior, with 17% of people having thought of suicide at some point in their lives, and only 1% was seen in the emergency department4. The principal risk factors for suicide are as follows: history of attempted suicide and mental disorder1,4,6. Previous attempt is the most important predictive factor, indicating that this patient is five to six times more likely to try again4,5,7,8. Besides mental disorders, other factors such as social and psychological aspects and health conditions, even impulsive acts, are involved2,4. The most frequently mental disorders associated with suicide are depression, bipolar mood disorder, dependence on alcohol and other psychoactive drugs, schizophrenia, and personality disorder. The risk becomes even bigger for patients with multiple psychiatric comorbidities4. Suicide prevention efforts are mainly focused on identifying people with mental health problems and on the availability of",

METHODS: This is an epidemiological descriptive/qualitative study of suicide attempts conducted between 2017 and 2020. This study used data from the Brazilian Information system for notifications involving suicide attempts (Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o de Agravos de Notifica\u00e7\u00e3o, SINAN) and 447 notifications were obtained. An analysis of the electronic medical record of these patients was performed in order to investigate the mental disorders, using a questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 447 notifications, 382 were eligible for the study. Using the 95% confidence interval, there was a higher frequency of females with 71.7% aged between 18 and 35 years representing 48.4%, with 77.2% white race/color, the singles appeared in the majority with 47.6% with a history of previous suicide attempts, using exogenous intoxication as a method in the attempt with 67.5%. Regarding mental health, 66.5% of the patients had some mental disorders, with the highest prevalence of recurrent depressive disorder found in 40.6%. CONCLUSION: It was observed that there is a need for training of health professionals and implementation of programs and preventive measures aimed primarily at females aged between 18 and 35 years with mental disorders, especially with recurrent depressive disorder and with a history of previous suicide attempt.

These data were provided by the Municipal Health Department of Francisco Beltr\u00e3o. SINAN is updated through notifications realized by the multidisciplinary teams of health units that provide care to these victims, filling out the specific Interpersonal/Self-Inflicted Violence form. Through this report, the following variables were extracted: sex, marital status, age group, method used in the suicide attempt, and if it occurred other times.\nThen, for the analysis of information regarding mental disorders and multidisciplinary care, data collection was carried out through the verification of the electronic medical record using the operating system of the municipal health secretary, the electronic medical record of each patient individually since 2017, using a closed questionnaire, answering questions related to diagnosis of mental disorder, suicide attempts and/or reports of suicidal ideation, use of psychotropic medication for mental disorders, monitoring by a psychiatrist, psychologist and by the referral health unit of the patient.\nMental disorders were classified as described by the WHO in relation to those with the highest prevalence in cases of attempted suicide, and using the ICD \u2014 International Classification of Diseases1, as follows: F19: Mental and behavioral disorders resulting from the use of psychoactive substances; F20: Schizophrenia; F31: Bipolar affective disorder; F33: Recurrent depressive disorder; F39: Unspecified \u201caffective\u201d mood disorders; F41: Anxiety disorders; and F60: Personality disorders.\nThe methods used in the suicide attempt were classified as Gunshot wounds, Knife wounds, Hanging, Exogenous intoxication (ingestion of drug overdose or other intoxication), Precipitation from high places, and other methods.\nThe inclusion criteria included all patients notified as a suicide attempt in the municipality of Francisco Beltr\u00e3o, Paran\u00e1, from January 2017 to December 2020. Exclusion criteria used were notifications made for cases of accidental intoxication and\ninterpersonal violence. Thus, of the 447 notifications extracted from the SINAN for interpersonal or self-inflicted violence, only 382 were considered eligible for suicide attempts, due to some notifications that did not qualify as a suicide attempt and/or duplicate.\nBeing a documentary research, without direct contact with patients, it did not preset any risk to patients, as well as those related to breaches of confidentiality, safeguarding the ethical and moral precept throughout its execution, not being necessary the approval by the ethics committee.\nMaintaining the ethical and legal precepts, the identity of the subjects was kept confidential and the information collated reliably as shown in the notification forms in SINAN and in the electronic records of notified patients.\nThe collected data were analyzed using the statistical program IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version 21. Absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies were calculated to describe the sample profile. The chi-square test with continuity correction was performed to compare and cross-reference patients with a diagnosis of mental disorder and categorical variables, with values that presented p<0.05 being considered statistically significant."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The prevalence of cases of suicide attempts in females can be explained by the fact that in males, suicide prevails as a fait accompli, because men tend to use more lethal medhods11.\nA lot of factors must be evaluated, which may be associated with sex, as the fact that women may be more vulnerable to moral and/or sexual violence and even physical aggression. Other factors are linked to unemployment and the women social culture in the family and society12. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in females are also related to sexual and domestic violence, unwanted or unplanned pregnancy, and mental disorders13. These suicidal behaviors presented in the age group between 20 and 35 years could be due to several reasons, including emotional, family and social problems, rejection, neglect, physical and sexual abuse in childhood, depressive mood, and family history of psychiatric disorders14.\nData on race/color as a self-declared variable showed that 77.2% of the population declared themselves white, in line with the profile of the state of Paran\u00e1, which, according to the IBGE, more than 60% of the population declared themselves white15.\nSingle individuals who still live alone have a high suicide rate. With the decrease in the average number of people in the family and especially the lack socialization, they have a significant relation with the increase in the suicide rate16.\nIt is noteworthy that some disorders can lead to suicidal behavior and act as a mood disorder with 36%. In suicide victims, depression has the high prevalence, and it is more prevalent in women (25%) than that in men (12\u201313%). Data show that 6\u20138% of the Brazilian population will experience at least one episode in their lifetime4,17.\nPsychiatric disorders account for a large proportion of suicides and suicide attempts, and these numbers are at least 10 times higher than in the general population. The reported percentage of suicides committed in this context varies between 60% and 98% of all suicides. Mental disorders, and more specifically depressive disorder, are more prevalent in women and have a strong association with suicide4,6.\nIn Brazil, in 2014, of the notified cases, 28% had already made a previous attempt11. One of the most important factors\n522\nRev Assoc Med Bras 2022;68(4):519-523\nin future suicidal behavior is that the first suicide attempt has taken place4,18. There are still some doctors who think that patients who talk about suicidal ideation will never do it, that talking about the subject can encourage the act, are taboos that intervene in the assessment and adequate conduct19.\nSuicide attempts using drug intoxications occur mainly in young adults and females, corroborating the data from the present study, which suggests the need to implement assistance programs aimed at young adults that allow for the identification of risk situations for the suicidal act, due to the prevalence of suicide attempts in relation to the age group of 20\u201339 years with the abusive use of medications with a focus on causing their own death 20,21.\nThus, the multidisciplinary treatment for patients who attempted suicide is essential for the prevention of completed suicide.\nRegarding the data in Table 2, demonstrating the association of patients diagnosed with mental disorder with the other variables in the sample, it is remarkable that patients diagnosed with mental disorder, undergoing multidisciplinary and drug treatment, still attempted suicide and the chance is 56.3%. These data show a warning, since patients undergoing treatment are still trying to commit suicide, which can expose weakness in treatment protocols, lack of trained professionals in care, difficult access, especially when the patient presents clinical instability. With a focus on reducing suicide rates, it is necessary to minimize ignorance and stigma related to mental illness. Suicide risk assessment should be performed whenever the physician deems it necessary19.\nSuicide prevention requires prevention and protection strategies at all levels of society.
