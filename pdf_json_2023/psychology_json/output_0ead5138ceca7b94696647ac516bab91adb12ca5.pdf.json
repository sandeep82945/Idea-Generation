    "abstractText": "In the marine environment, steel materials usually encounter serious problems with chemical or electrochemical corrosion and fouling by proteins, bacteria, and other marine organisms. In this work, a green bifunctional Z-scheme CuOx/Ag/P25 heterostructure coating material was designed to achieve the coordination of corrosion prevention and antifouling by matching the redox potential of the reactive oxygen species and the corrosion potential of 304SS. When CuOx/Ag/P25 heterostructure was coupled with the protected metal, the open circuit potential under illumination negatively shifted about 240 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the photoinduced current density reached 16.6 \u03bcA cm\u22122. At the same time, more reactive oxygen species were produced by the Z-shape structure, and then the photocatalytic sterilization effect was stronger. Combined with the chemical sterilization of Ag and the oxide of Cu, the bacterial survival rate of CuOx/Ag/P25 was low (0.006%) compared with the blank sample. This design provides a strategy for developing green dual-functional coating materials with photoelectrochemical anticorrosion and antifouling properties.",

            "text": "Metal corrosion and fouling in the marine environment are very serious because of the presence of oxygen, Cl\u2212 ions, sunlight, and micro-organisms [1\u20133], causing huge economic losses and significant harm to the human living environment. Corrosion generally results from chemical or electrochemical reactions between the metal and oxygen, while the metal surface submerged in seawater or in the humid marine atmosphere is often fouled by marine organisms such as proteins, bacteria, algae, and mollusks, which usually increase the metal weight and accelerate material surface damage [4,5]. Various methods, such as coatings [6], corrosion inhibitors [7], and cathodic protection [8], have been proposed to help reduce metal corrosion in the marine environment. However, these traditional anticorrosion techniques usually suffer from the high cost of resources or additional energy, together with the problem of environmental pollution. Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (PECCP) technology, which couples a semiconductor material with the protected metal, is a new and green anticorrosion technology [1,3,9]. During the PECCP process, under illumination the semiconductor material generates photoelectrons, which are transferred to the protected metal surface to make the metal potential more negative than its corrosion potential. The typical semiconductor materials, TiO2 [2,10,11], ZnO [12], and SrTiO3 [9,13], have been evaluated for the PECCP process. Among them, TiO2 is one of the most widely used photoelectric anode materials, and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 456. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28010456 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nit has the advantages of high photoelectrochemical activity, low cost, high stability, and nontoxicity [14,15]. However, TiO2 has a low utilization rate of sunlight (<5%), with a relatively wide band gap (~3.2 eV) [16] and a fast recombination rate of photogenerated carriers, which seriously limits its application in the PECCP field. Currently, forming a heterojunction by coupling narrow-band-gap metal oxides with TiO2 is an effective way to improve the absorption of visible light and promote the separation of electron/hole pairs [17,18]. Tian et al. [3] deposited Cu2O nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 nanotubes to prepare the Cu2O/TiO2 p-n heterojunction composite photoelectrodes to accelerate the photogenerated carriers\u2019 separation and improve PECCP performance. Regarding the protection against microbial corrosion, the addition of antibacterial components to the protective paints or coatings has been commonly used to achieve antifouling and antibacterial effects [19]. Although many heavy metals and rare earth elements, such as Cu, Ag, Ce, La, etc., have a strong bactericidal effect [20\u201322], their adverse effects on the environment need to be considered [23]. It is reported that some semiconductors can be also used for photocatalytic sterilization and antifouling, which is correlated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS, such as superoxide radicals \u2022O2\u2212 and hydroxyl radicals \u2022OH) under irradiation and their inhibition to the growth of bacteria [24]. Wang et al. [24] reported that AgVO3/BiO2\u2212x inactivated bacteria in full spectrum, which is due to a large amount of ROS caused by internal structural defects and the formation of heterostructures. Moreover, the integration of chemical sterilization with photocatalytic sterilization has become a key research goal in the antimicrobial field [25\u201327]. Yang et al. [25] designed Cu2O/Ag composites with strong and long-term antibacterial activities. Apparently, both the PECCP performance and photocatalytic antibacterial properties of semiconductors are related to the light absorption, photoinduced charges separation, and the conduction/valence-band positions. In this sense, we herein design a bifunctional CuOx/Ag/TiO2 Z-type heterojunction, which is anticipated as coating material for metal anticorrosion/antifouling in the marine environment on the basis of the following considerations. (i) Both CuOx and TiO2 hold higher conduction-band positions against the potential of stainless steel (e.g., 304SS) and make the transfer of photoinduced electrons to the metal for PECCP possible. (ii) The combination of Ag nanoparticles (NP) with a local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and small-band-gap CuOx can improve the visible light absorption of TiO2 [28,29]. (iii) The unique Z-type CuOx/Ag/TiO2 heterojunction provides an effective charge transfer path for realizing the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs without sacrificing redox ability [30]. (iv) The bacteria, viruses, and other micro-organisms can be inhibited or chemically killed by Ag and CuOx and by active ROS groups produced by photoinduced electrons and holes from the heterojunction [25\u201327,31,32]. As expected, the as-designed CuOx/Ag/TiO2 not only well demonstrates photocathodic protection performance for 304SS in the simulated seawater but also possesses chemical and photocatalytic synergistic bactericidal activities. Such a green bifunctional coating material shows great promise in metal anticorrosion and antifouling applications in the marine environment."

As shown in Figure 1a, the diffraction peaks for P25 could be assigned to anatase and rutile TiO2 (JCPDS 84-1285 and JCPDS 86-0148). The diffraction peak intensity at 2\u03b8 = 25.3 \u25e6 was strong, and the peak shape was symmetrical, indicating that the crystallinity of the material is very good. The reference material CuOx presented characteristic diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 = 36.4 and 42.3 \u25e6, corresponding to the (111) and (200) crystal planes of the Cu2O phase of cubic hematite (JCPDS 05-0667). Compared with P25 and CuOx, the diffraction peaks for CuOx/Ag/P25 remained unchanged, indicating that CuOx and Ag did not affect the crystal structure of P25, which may have been due to the small load, the small particle size, and the low crystallinity of CuOx and Ag [3,33]. The morphologies and nanostructures\nof CuOx/Ag/P25 were analyzed by TEM and HRTEM. As shown in Figure 1b, the lattice spacings of 2.5 and 3.6 \u00c5 corresponded to the (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2 and the (101) crystal plane of rutile TiO2, respectively. The lattice spacings of 2.1 and 2.4 \u00c5 were ascribed to the (100) and (111) crystal planes of Cu2O [3,16,34]. The (200) crystal plane of Ag with a lattice spacing of about 2.08 \u00c5 was found at the interface between the CuOx phase and the P25 phase [35]. Figure 1c shows that CuOx/Ag/P25 was mainly composed of irregular particles with a diameter of 20~25 nm. The EDS element distribution mapping in Figure 1d exhibited that the Ti, O, Ag, and Cu elements were evenly distributed in CuOx/Ag/P25. The corresponding element content is listed in Figure 1i.\nThe atomic valence states and energy-band structures of CuOx/P25, Ag/P25, and CuOx/Ag/P25 were further studied by XPS. The Ti 2p spectra for P25 in Figure 2a showed a pair of spin-orbital doublets at ~464.2 and ~458.5 eV, corresponding to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 of Ti4+, respectively [3,28,36]. Compared with P25, the peaks for CuOx/Ag/P25 showed a shift to a higher binding energy, which was possibly due to the strong interaction between CuOx, Ag, and P25 in the heterojunction structure of CuOx/Ag/P25 [37]. The O1s spectra of the samples shown in Figure 2b can be divided into four types of peaks in total. Peak A, around 529.8 eV, belonged to the oxide peak, which was related to the lattice oxygen in TiO2. The slightly shifted peak B, at ~530.9 eV, also belonged to the metal (Ag and Cu) oxide peak, which was attributed to the O atom near the oxygen vacancy [38].\nPeak C, around ~532 eV, belonged to the -OH group, chemically adsorbed on the material surface [39], and peak D, around ~533 eV, belonged to adsorbed H2O molecules on the surface [40]. Figure 2c shows that the Ag 3d spectra of Ag/P25 and CuOx/Ag/P25 can be deconvoluted into two peaks, Ag 3d3/2 (373.5 eV) and Ag 3d5/2 (367.5 eV), indicating the existence of Ag metal in the material [30]. In the Cu 2p spectra for CuOx (Figure 2d), the peaks with binding energies of 934 and 932.6 eV can belong to the Cu2+ [41] and Cu+ [42] species, respectively. In addition, the satellite peaks corresponding to Cu2+ species can be seen between 940 and 945 eV. This indicates that Cu+ and Cu2+ coexisted in CuOx. For CuOx/P25 and CuOx/Ag/P25, only peaks at 932.6 eV corresponding to the binding state of Cu+ species were observed, which demonstrates that the strong interaction between the carrier (P25) and the load (CuOx and Ag) made the Cu species stable."

            "text": "UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (or UV-vis DRS) were measured to investigate the light absorption of samples. Figure 3a showed a typical TiO2 light-absorption range. The light-absorption range of as-prepared CuOx/Ag/P25 was extended to the visible region with an edge of about 436 nm after loading CuOx and/or Ag. At the same time, it can be observed that Ag/P25 and CuOx/Ag/P25 had strong and wide absorption peaks near 550 nm, which were related to the LSPR effect of Ag NPs [43,44]. Figure 3a shows the band-gap results of the materials. CuOx/Ag/P25 holds the narrowest band gap (2.17 eV) compared with P25 (3.01 eV), CuOx/P25 (2.87 eV) and Ag/P25 (2.49 eV). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the catalysts at an excitation wavelength of 550 nm at room temperature were displayed in Figure 3b. The fluorescence peak intensity for CuOx/Ag/P25 was lower than that of other compound materials, indicating the lowest recombination rate of e\u2212/h+ pairs. The fluorescence intensity order was CuOx/Ag/P25 < Ag/P25 < CuOx/P25 < P25, which suggested that having Ag NP as the electron bridge promoted the separation and emigration of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [30,45]. By plotting the Kubelka\u2013Munk function against the photon energy, the band0gap (Eg) values of P25 and CuOx were estimated to be 3.01 and 2.05 eV, respectively (Figure 3c,d). Moreover, the Eg values of the composites, such as Ag/P25, CuOx/P25, and CuOx/Ag/P25, became\nnarrower after loading CuOx and Ag, which confirmed the broadened light-response range. According to the XPS valence-band (or XPS-VB) spectra in Figure 3e,f, the corresponding EVB,XPS of P25 and CuOx were 2.55 and 1.5 eV, respectively. The VB positions of P25 and CuOx were calculated as 2.31 eV and 1.26 eV, respectively, by using the following equation: EVB,NHE = \u03d5 + EVB,XPS \u2212 4.44, where \u03d5 is the work function of the instrument (4.2 eV [46]).\nThe electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of free radical adducts trapped by DMPO in the dark and under irradiation at room temperature for the catalysts are shown in Figure 4. The EPR signals for DMPO\u2212\u2022OH and DMPO\u2212\u2022O2\u2212 were almost negligible on P25, CuOx/P25, Ag/P25, and CuOx/Ag/P25 in darkness. Both DMPO\u2212\u2022OH and DMPO\u2212\u2022O2\u2212 signals with four characteristic peaks with intensity ratios of 1:2:2:1 and 1:1:1:1 [47], respectively, can be observed in the suspension under simulated solar irradiation for 12 min. EPR signals of DMPO\u2212\u2022OH and DMPO\u2212O2\u2022\u2212 were different in intensity. The intensity order of DMPO\u2212\u2022O2\u2212 signals under irradiation was CuOx/Ag/P25 > Ag/P25 > CuOx/P25 > P25; the intensity order of DMPO\u2212\u2022OH signals under irradiation was CuOx/Ag/P25 > Ag/P25 \u2248 CuOx/P25 > P25. CuOx/Ag/P25 showed the highest\nintensity in the characteristic peaks of DMPO\u2212\u2022OH and DMPO\u2212\u2022O2\u2212 when compared with those materials."

            "text": "In general, photogenerated cathodic protection works by supplying electrons to the protected metal through an external photosensitive semiconductor, causing the metal potential to be more negative than the original corrosion potential under irradiation. Thus, the photoinduced OCP value is an important parameter to evaluate the PECCP performance of photoanode materials. Figure 5a shows the photogenerated OCP-time curves of samples. The photoelectrodes that were coupled with 304SS were used as working electrodes. P25 showed the minimum negative potential shift of 90 mV under light on/off cycles, which was a little lower than the self-corrosion potential of 304SS (\u221250 mV), indicating that P25 hardly achieved PECCP toward 304SS. The negative shift order of OCP values for samples was CuOx/Ag/P25 > CuOx/P25 > Ag/P25 > P25. Compared with CuOx/P25 and Ag/P25, CuOx/Ag/P25 displayed a significantly more negative potential shift of 240 mV under illumination, indicating that the introduction of CuOx and Ag improved the separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs, and more electrons were transferred to the coupled 304SS to provide photoelectrochemical cathodic protection. Figure 5b shows the photoelectric response of P25, CuOx/P25, Ag/P25, and CuOx/Ag/P25 coupled with 304SS in a 3.65 wt.% NaCl solution with an applied bias potential of 0 V (Eref). P25, CuOx/P25, Ag/P25, and CuOx/Ag/P25 showed a positive current density change when the light was turned on, showing the characteristics of an n-type semiconductor [48]. It indicates that photoinduced electrons could be transferred from the semiconductor materials to the coupled 304SS. Compared with P25, the photocurrent densities of CuOx/P25 and CuOx/Ag/P25 greatly increased at the first light on/off switching. At the same time, using Ag particles as a conducting medium accelerated the separation of electron-hole pairs [3,30]. Thus, CuOx/Ag/P25 had a photocurrent density of 16.6 \u00b5A cm2, which was ~1.8 times greater than that of P25, indicating that it had the best PECCP performance. The migration\nability of photogenerated carriers could be characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).\nFigure 5c,d show EIS results measured in the dark and under illumination, respectively. In darkness, the impedance arc radius of CuOx/Ag/P25 was larger than that of the other materials, which indicates that the thin film electrode could be used as a coating material to protect 304SS from corrosion [18]. Under illumination, the smaller the impedance arc radius of the impedance spectrum is, the faster the photogenerated carriers migrate, resulting in better PECCP properties [49]. Figure 5d shows that CuOx/Ag/P25 had the smallest arc radius, demonstrating the best carriers transfer efficiency and thus the greatest photochemical cathodic protection effect, which was consistent with the results of OCP response and the photoinduced current. In the corresponding equivalent circuit model, Rs, Rd, and Rc represented the solution resistance, the depletion layer resistance, and the charge transfer resistance [50], respectively. The fitting results in Table 1 showed that CuOx/Ag/P25 had a higher Rd value than P25, which may have been due to the bending of the Fermi level caused by the formation of a Z-type heterostructure. Moreover, CuOx/Ag/P25 had an Rc value of 1.23 \u2126, much smaller than P25 (2.47 \u00d7 104), CuOx/P25 (1.22 \u00d7 104), and Ag/P25 (300.5), respectively. Therefore, it could be understandable that CuOx/Ag/P25 had the best PECCP performance for 304 SS in a 3.65 wt.% NaCl solution."

The optical pictures of E. coli colonies on nutrient agar plates in Figure 6a exhibited that CuOx/Ag/P25 and Ag/P25 coatings had fewer E. coli colonies than the other samples did, indicating better antibacterial activities under 24 h of illumination. Taking the blank sample without active catalysts as a counterpart in Figure 6b, it can be calculated that the bacterial survival rate of P25 and CuOx/P25 in a 1 \u00d7 106\u2013times diluted bacterial solution were about 81.1% and 75.4%, respectively. Moreover, as shown in Figure 6c,d and Figure 7, the bacterial survival rates of Ag/P25 and CuOx/Ag/P25 in a 100-times diluted solution were as low as 0.116% and 0.006%, respectively.

Moreover, because the VB potential of CuOx is not positive enough for the production of \u2022OH from H2O oxidation, the stronger DMPO\u2022OH signal of CuOx/Ag/P25, compared with that of Ag/P25 (Figure 4d), indicates that CuOx/Ag/P25 is inclined to form a Z-scheme system in which the photoinduced electrons in Ag/P25 transfer and combine with the holes on the valance band (VB) of CuOx, leaving the photoinduced holes at the VB of P25 for the production of \u2022OH and the photoinduced electrons at the conduction band (CB) of CuOx for the photocathode protection and production of superoxide ions (O2\u2022\u2212). Additionally, the incorporation of Ag NP with the LSPR effect and CuOx with a narrow band gap greatly improved the visible light absorption (Figure 3a). All these together promoted the production of photoinduced charges and the ROS of \u2022O2\u2212 and \u2022OH radicals (Figure 4) under illumination. On one hand, the efficient production and transfer of the photoinduced charges in the unique Z-scheme heterojunction of CuOx/Ag/P25 makes effective the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of CuOx to the coupled 304SS, achieving enough of a negative shift of the 304SS potential and photoelectrochemical cathodic polarization protection toward the metal (Figure 5a). On the other hand, their strong ROS (superoxide radicals \u2022O2\u2212 and hydroxyl radicals \u2022OH) production ability upon irradiation and their ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria, viruses, and other micro-organisms provide the antifouling ability of the CuOx/Ag/P25 coating [26,27]. Moreover, both CuOx and Ag NPs, especially the Cu2O species stabilized by the photoinduced electrons through the unique Z-scheme transfer path (Figure 2d), effectively maintain chemical disinfection properties [25,31,32]. The superior antibacterial performance of CuOx/Ag/P25 and their application potential as an antifouling coating are demonstrated in Figures 6 and 7."
