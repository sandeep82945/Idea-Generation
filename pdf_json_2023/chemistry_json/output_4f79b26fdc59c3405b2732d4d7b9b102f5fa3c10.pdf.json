    "abstractText": "Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs); are a functionally diverse family of eukaryotic molecules that deploy a highly-specialized array of phosphate groups as a combinatorial cell-signaling code. One reductive strategy to derive a molecular-level understanding of the many actions of PP-InsPs is to individually characterize the proteins that bind them. Here, we describe an alternate approach that seeks a single, collective rationalization for PP-InsP binding to an entire group of proteins, i.e., the multiple nucleolar proteins previously reported to bind 5-InsP7 (5-diphospho-inositol-1,2,3,4,6pentakisphosphate). Quantitative confocal imaging of the outer nucleolar granular region revealed its expansion when cellular 5-InsP7 levels were elevated by either (a) reducing the 5-InsP7 metabolism by a CRISPR-based knockout (KO) of either NUDT3 or PPIP5Ks; or (b), the heterologous expression of wildtype inositol hexakisphosphate kinase, i.e., IP6K2; separate expression of a kinase-dead IP6K2 mutant did not affect granular volume. Conversely, the nucleolar granular region in PPIP5K KO cells shrank back to the wild-type volume upon attenuating 5-InsP7 synthesis using either a pan-IP6K inhibitor or the siRNA-induced knockdown of IP6K1+IP6K2. Significantly, the inner fibrillar volume of the nucleolus was unaffected by 5-InsP7. We posit that 5-InsP7 acts as an \u2018electrostatic glue\u2019 that binds together positively charged surfaces on separate proteins, overcoming mutual protein\u2013protein electrostatic repulsion the latter phenomenon is a known requirement for the assembly of a non-membranous biomolecular condensate.",

The most well-studied of this group of polyvalent molecules are 5-diphosphoinositol-1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate (5-InsP7) and 1,5-bis-diphosphoinositol2,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate (1,5-InsP8), which are synthesized by two key groups of enzymes: the inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks) and the diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases (PPIP5Ks) (Figure 1A). Considerable evidence indicates that these PP-InsPs\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 153. https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13010153 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomolecules\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 153 2 of 14\nare metabolically interconnected through a metabolic cycle [3], in which specialized phosphatases degrade 1,5-InsP8 through 1-InsP7 to InsP6; the most active of these phosphatases is DIPP1/NUDT3, which also dephosphorylates 5-InsP7 to InsP6 (Figure 1A).\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 15\ndiphosphoinositol-2,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate (1,5-InsP8), which are synthesized by two key groups of enzymes: the inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks) and the diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases (PPIP5Ks) (Figure 1A). Considerable evidence indicates that these PP-InsPs are metabolically interconnected through a metabolic cycle [3], in which specialized phosphatases degrade 1,5-InsP8 through 1-InsP7 to InsP6; the most active of these phosphatases is DIPP1/NUDT3, which also dephosphorylates 5-InsP7 to InsP6 (Figure 1A).\nSeveral biological activities have been attributed to the PP-InsPs. A few examples serve to illustrate this functional diversity: 1,5-InsP8 supervises the inorganic phosphate (Pi) balance in both plants [5] and animals [6]; this is metabolically critical not only because Pi is a fundamental component of the cell\u2019s \u201cenergy currency\u201d (i.e., ATP), but also because Pi is one of the most pervasive regulators of basic cellular metabolism [7]. Other studies have demonstrated that 1,5-InsP8 exerts control over cellular nucleotide synthesis, with sometimes dramatic consequences for cellular proliferation [8]. As for 5-InsP7, it regulates PolI-mediated rRNA transcription by Saccharomyces cerevisiae [9]. In mammals, 5-InsP7 regulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells [10,11], licenses high-fat diet-induced obesity [12], modulates the degradation of the plasma membrane sodium-potassium pump [13], and it inhibits mRNA decapping and promotes the accumulation of Processing (P-) bodies [14,15].\nSeveral biological activities ha been attributed to the PP-InsPs. A few examples serve to illustrate this functional diversity: 1,5-InsP8 supervises the inorganic phosphat (Pi) bala ce in both plants [5] and animals [6]; this is metabolically critical not only because Pi is a fundamental component of the cell\u2019s \u201cenergy currency\u201d (i.e., ATP), but also because Pi is one of the most pervasive regulators of basic cellular metabolism [7]. Other studies have demonstrated that 1,5-InsP8 exerts control over cellular nucleotide synthesis, with sometimes dramatic consequences for cellular proliferation [8]. As for 5-InsP7, it regulates PolI-mediated rRNA transcription by Saccharomyces cerevisiae [9]. In mammals, 5-InsP7 regulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells [10,11], licenses high-fat diet-induced obesity [12], modulates the degradation of the plasma membrane sodiumpotassium pump [13], and it inhibits mRNA decapping and promotes the accumulation of Processing (P-) bodies [14,15]. The molecular basis for some of the actions of PP-InsPs involves the modification of target protein functions by the donation of the molecules\u2019 \u03b2-phosphoryl groups in a non-enzymic reaction known as protein pyrophosphorylation [16\u201318]. However, in part, due to the synthesis and application of metabolically resistant PP-InsPs such as 5-PCP-\nInsP7 (5-methylene-diphosphonate inositol 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate; Figure 1B), it is known that their non-covalent interactions with proteins expand the repertoire of PPInsP signaling mechanisms [19]. Two examples of such mechanisms have emerged to date. First, the binding of PP-InsPs to certain PH domains can regulate the intracellular distribution of the host proteins [20\u201322]. The only other characterized PP-InsP-binding module is the SPX domain, but this is thought to be present in just one mammalian protein: XPR1 [6,23,24]. The latter is itself only known to have one function, namely, the regulation of the cellular efflux of Pi [6,23,25]. Consequently, it is thought that the rationalization of the functional diversity of this cell-signaling family depends upon the identification of other PP-InsP binding proteins; therefore there are ongoing efforts to catalog the entire PP-InsP interactome [19,26]. This approach has uncovered a bewilderingly large number of proteins that can associate with PP-InsPs, either directly or indirectly [19,26]. This situation is unprecedented for any other small-molecule intracellular signal, and its significance has not previously been rationalized. Our goal has been to resolve this paradox in the current study. As an alternative to the reductive approach of attaching functional significance to the binding of a PP-InsP to a single protein, we have asked a question from a systems biology perspective: could there be a single, collective response to PP-InsP binding for an entire group of proteins? To find a potential answer, we have focused on the nucleolus, which contains a particularly high concentration of a variety of 5-InsP7-binding proteins, including components of RNA polymerase I complex, RNA polymerase III complex, and small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins [19,26,27]. Indeed, Arg- and Lys-rich sequences recur in nucleolar targeting motifs [28,29], thereby rendering all such proteins as candidates for ionic interactions with 5-InsP7, which has nine negative charges at a physiological pH. It has further been hypothesized that PP-InsPs can act as an \u2018electrostatic glue\u2019 that binds together positively charged surfaces on two separate proteins [2]. On a global scale, such a phenomenon could overcome protein\u2013protein electrostatic repulsion and strongly elevate local protein concentrations, both of which are requirements for promoting the assembly of non-membranous biomolecular condensates [30]. Since the nucleolus is an important example of just such a phase-separated structure, we have hypothesized that the nucleolar volume might be increased by experimental procedures that elevate cellular 5-InsP7 levels. Herein we describe experiments that confirm that proposal."

Thus, we investigated the impact of the PPIP5K KO on nucleolar architecture. We first recorded the nucleolar granular volume in the intact cells. Previous studies have quantified the size of this nucleolar compartment by staining protein markers such as nucleostemin (NSM) and nucleophosmin [38\u201340]. The analysis of endogenously expressed proteins avoids potential artifacts that might arise from the heterologous expression of fluorescently tagged nucleolar proteins.

The Impact of NUDT3 KO upon Nucleolar Granular Volume Mammalian cells express five isoforms of the NUDT/DIPP phosphatases (Figure 1A); we are not aware of any published studies with mammalian cells that have assayed the impact upon PP-IP levels for knocking out any of these phosphatases. However, kinetic studies with recombinant enzymes indicate that NUDT3/DIPP1 has the highest catalytic efficiency [42], and so we reasoned that cells in which the corresponding gene knocked out would show elevated levels of 5-InsP7, thereby yielding another method to study the impact of this PP-InsP upon the nucleolus. We have used CRISPR to create two independent clones of HCT116 NUDT3 KO cells (namely KO\u03b1 and KO\u03b2; Figure 4A). The HPLC analysis of [3H]inositol-labeled cells showed that both clonal lines contained 40% higher levels of 5-InsP7 compared to WT cells (Figure 4B,C). This has no significant impact on InsP6, which is not surprising as its levels are approximately 20-fold higher than those of 5-InsP7 (Figure 4B). This is why we followed a usual practice in the field, which is to consider InsP6 as an internal standard to which levels of 5-InsP7 and InsP8 can be normalized. Significantly, in NUDT3 KO cells, the nucleolar granular volume was about two-fold higher than that of wild-type cells (Figure 4E,F). This KO did not alter InsP8 levels (Figure 4B,D), which is consistent with the previous kinetic analysis of PPIP5Ks\u2019 separate kinase and phosphatase activities that predict cellular InsP8 levels to be relatively insensitive to changes in 5-InsP7 concentration [43]. To further interrogate the relationship between cellular 5-InsP7 levels and nucleolar granular volume, we next performed a series of independent experiments in which we directly modulated the levels of this PP-IP by using several independent protocols (Figure 5A): the viral transduction of IP6K constructs, the pharmacological inhibition of IP6Ks, siRNA against IP6Ks, or delivery into cells of a metabolically stable 5-InsP7 analog using lipid nanoparticles. This application of multiple protocols represents a particularly robust approach to the identification of PP-InsP functionality.\nFigure 3.

This pharmacological approach completely reversed the increase in the NSM volume that is normally observed in PPIP5K KO cells (Figure 5D). Another important aspect of this particular experiment is that PPIP5K KO cells cannot synthesize 1-InsP7 nor InsP8 [31]. Thus, the impact of TNP upon the nucleolar volume in these cells must be independent of these two PP-InsPs. We also decreased IP6K activity in HCT116 cells by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of IP6K1 plus IP6K2 exactly as previously described for these cells [14]. This IP6K1/IP6K2 knockdown in PPIP5K KO cells shrank the NSM volume to that observed in wild-type cells (Figure 5E)."

            "text": "We rece tly described a procedure by which PP-InsPs could be encapsulated into liposomes for delivery into the cytoplasm of intact HCT116 cells [6,14]. It has been determined that liposomes will release their cargo into the cytoplasm following their endocytosis and delivery into tubular recycling endosomes [44]. We used this same procedure (Figure 5A) to deliver metabolically stable 5-PCP-InsP7 [45] into wild-type HCT116 cells. In these experiments, nucleolar granular volume was elevated approximately two-fold (Figure 5F).\nThis is a particularly significant result because five-PCP-InsP7 cannot support protein pyrophosphorylation, which is one molecular mechanism by which PP-IPs can modify protein function [16,18]. Thus, we conclude that 5-InsP7 may regulate nucleolar volume through non-covalent interactions with appropriate target proteins [46]."

For example, we show that the granular, NSM-positive volume expands in response to elevations in the 5-InsP7 accumulation brought about by the CRISPR-based KO of either NUDT3 or PPIP5Ks (Figures 2 and 4); through the heterologous expression of wild-type IP6K2 (but not through the expression of the kinase-dead mutant, Figure 5B,C) the delivery into cells of 5-PCP-InsP7 was achieved (Figure 5F). Conversely, the nucleolar volume can be returned to the level seen in wild-type cells upon treatment with PPIP5K KO cells with either the pan-IP6K inhibitor TNP (Figure 5D), or by siRNA-induced knockdown of IP6K1+IP6K2 (Figure 5E). Our observation that 5-InsP7 influences the granular but not the fibrillar volume speak to the specificity of the action, which could be explained by functional interactions of this PP-InsP primarily with granular proteins. This is an unprecedented demonstration that nucleolar architecture is modulated by a naturally occurring messenger molecule. Proteins and other macromolecules have been the focus of previous studies into electrostatic interactions that contribute to the dynamic regulation of the assembly, function, and disassembly of biomolecular condensates [47,48]. However, the 5-InsP7 molecule has an exceptional negative charge density and has previously been demonstrated to associate electrostatically with multiple nucleolar proteins [19,26,27]. Indeed, 5-InsP7 may act as an \u2018electrostatic glue\u2019 that binds together positively charged surfaces on two separate proteins (Figure 5G and [2]). At a nucleolar level, such a phenomenon could overcome general protein\u2013protein electrostatic repulsion and strongly elevate local protein concentrations, both of which are requirements for promoting the assembly of non-membranous biomolecular condensates [30]. It is this process, we propose, that can explain how an increase in 5-InsP7 levels facilitates the expansion of the nucleolar granular compartment. This hypothesis takes PP-InsP research into a new direction by its emphasis on the collective significance of multiple ligand\u2013protein interactions, as opposed to prior studies that attach separate biological outcomes of 5-InsP7 binding to individual proteins. This electrostatic model could, in theory, also apply to the other two mammalian PP-InsPs, 1-InsP7, and 1,5-InsP8 (Figure 1). However, we deem this as an unlikely scenario, as these molecules are 10- and 50-fold less abundant than 5-InsP7 [3]. Moreover, both 1-InsP7 and 1,5-InsP8 cannot be synthesized by our PPIP5K KO cell line, which is used in the experiments described in Figure 5. We also do not exclude the possibility that the unique stereochemistry of 5-InsP7 may contribute to its regulation of nucleolar morphology. The further biological significance of our study arises from it providing a new perspective on the impact of dynamic changes in the nucleolar volume, which have previously largely focused on the consequences for rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis [41,47,49]. The rRNA is transcribed in the nucleolar fibrillar compartment; its volume was not affected by changes in the 5-InsP7 levels (Figure 2D,E,F). Moreover, we have shown that neither rRNA synthesis nor ribosome biogenesis is affected by elevations in the levels of 5-InsP7 (Figure 3). In previously reported experiments with the yeast S. cerevisiae [9], rRNA synthesis was impaired upon the elimination of all IP6K activity following the deletion of the Kcs1 gene. The latter study concluded that the Kcs1\u2206 yeast strain exhibited a defect in transcriptional elongation due to the loss of the 5-InsP7-mediated pyrophosphorylation of PolI [9]. We cannot exclude the possibility that this PP-InsP may have a similar, constitutive role that maintains rRNA synthesis in mammals, because. In our study we did not completely eliminate 5-InsP7 synthesis from HCT116 cells. In any case, the mechanisms by which\nan elevation in 5-InsP7 levels regulates the nucleolar volume in the current study must involve a separate process that is independent of protein pyrophosphorylation, since it is recapitulated by the metabolically stable analog, 5-PCP-InsP7 (Figure 5E). There are indications that our findings may have human health relevance. For example, a non-canonical function for the granular compartment of the nucleolus is homeostatic responses to certain cellular stresses (e,g. heat shock) [40]. Separately, it would appear to be detrimental for cells to exhibit sustained elevations in their nucleolar volume, which is inversely correlated with longevity [49]. Indeed, nucleolar size trends are smaller in humans if they adopt a healthier lifestyle and calorific reduction [49]. Pathological interest in the nucleolus is also concerned with neurodegeneration-related cellular events and cancerrelated pathways [28]. Significantly, aging is associated with both an elevated nucleolar volume [47,49] and higher steady-state levels of 5-InsP7 [50]; these two phenomena are directly linked in the current study.\nAuthor Contributions: S.B.S. and S.S. designed the project.
