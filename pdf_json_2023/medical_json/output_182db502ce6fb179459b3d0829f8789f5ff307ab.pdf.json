    "abstractText": "Background The inflammatory response to cerebral ischemia is complex; however, most clinical studies of stroke outcome focus on a few selected proteins. We, therefore, aimed to profile a broad range of inflammation-related proteins to: identify proteins associated with ischemic stroke outcome that are independent of established clinical predictors; identify proteins subsets for outcome prediction; and perform sex and etiological subtype stratified analyses. Methods Acute-phase plasma levels of 65 inflammation-related proteins were measured in 534 ischemic stroke cases. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations to unfavorable 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score > 2) and LASSO regressions to identify proteins with independent effects. Results Twenty proteins were associated with outcome in univariable models after correction for multiple testing (FDR < 0.05), and for 5 the association was independent of clinical variables, including stroke severity (TNFSF14 [LIGHT], OSM, SIRT2, STAMBP, and 4E-BP1). LASSO identified 9 proteins that could best separate favorable and unfavorable outcome with a predicted diagnostic accuracy (AUC) of 0.81; three associated with favorable (CCL25, TRAIL [TNFSF10], and Flt3L) and 6 with unfavorable outcome (CSF-1, EN-RAGE [S100A12], HGF, IL-6, OSM, and TNFSF14). Finally, we identified sexand etiologic subtype-specific associations with the best discriminative ability achieved for cardioembolic, followed by cryptogenic stroke. Conclusions We identified candidate blood-based protein biomarkers for post-stroke functional outcome involved in, e.g., NLRP3 inflammasome regulation and signaling pathways, such as TNF, JAK/STAT, MAPK, and NF-\u03baB. These proteins warrant further study for stroke outcome prediction as well as investigations into the putative causal role for stroke outcome.",

Logistic regression was used to estimate associations to unfavorable 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score > 2) and LASSO regressions to identify proteins with independent effects.\nResults Twenty proteins were associated with outcome in univariable models after correction for multiple testing (FDR < 0.05), and for 5 the association was independent of clinical variables, including stroke severity (TNFSF14 [LIGHT], OSM, SIRT2, STAMBP, and 4E-BP1). LASSO identified 9 proteins that could best separate favorable and unfavorable outcome with a predicted diagnostic accuracy (AUC) of 0.81; three associated with favorable (CCL25, TRAIL [TNFSF10], and Flt3L) and 6 with unfavorable outcome (CSF-1, EN-RAGE [S100A12], HGF, IL-6, OSM, and TNFSF14). Finally, we identified sex- and etiologic subtype-specific associations with the best discriminative ability achieved for cardioembolic, followed by cryptogenic stroke.\nConclusions We identified candidate blood-based protein biomarkers for post-stroke functional outcome involved in, e.g., NLRP3 inflammasome regulation and signaling pathways, such as TNF, JAK/STAT, MAPK, and NF-\u03baB.

            "text": "There are great inter-individual variations in outcomes after ischemic stroke. While this can in part be explained by clinical factors, acute interventions, and level of rehabilitation received [1], there is a need to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in brain injury and recovery. Experimental studies convincingly show that cerebral ischemia triggers an inflammatory response involving a complex network of signaling pathways [2\u20134]; however, many immune-modulating proteins remain understudied in clinical ischemic stroke cohorts. Exploratory searches for such proteins associated with ischemic stroke outcomes in human studies could point towards candidate biomarkers meriting further investigation for outcome prediction models.\nThe inflammatory response after ischemic stroke is a multistep pathway that initially involves Toll-like and Nod-like receptor (i.e., inflammasome) signaling followed by subsequent transcriptional activation of inflammatory mediators [2, 3]. The response includes resident brain cells as well as infiltrating peripheral immune cells due to blood\u2013brain barrier disruption [2, 4, 5]. These stimulated receptors trigger intracellular signaling cascades (e.g., JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, NF-\u03baB, and mTOR) [2], which in turn can rapidly affect expression of a variety of genes involved in the inflammatory and immune responses (e.g., cytokines and chemokines) [4\u20136]. Inflammation can have a paradoxical role in the response to cerebral ischemia. It can be neurotoxic and exacerbate the initial injury, contribute to expansion of the infarct and the development of cerebral edema. On the other hand, it can also be neuroprotective and promote repair by influencing infarct resolution and remodeling [4, 6, 7].\nWith regard to clinical studies of circulating levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers in acute ischemic stroke, interleukin (IL)-6 is the most extensively studied. IL-6 stimulates hepatic expression of the downstream marker C-reactive protein (CRP), and elevated circulating levels of both proteins have been associated with increased stroke severity and unfavorable functional outcome [8]. Examples of other mediators more upstream in the inflammatory cascade that have been studied with respect to stroke outcomes include pro-inflammatory proteins, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interferongamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) [9, 10], as well as anti-inflammatory proteins, such as IL-10, IL-4 and TNF-\u03b2 [3]. Given the intricacy and multidimensionality of this response, other cytokines and immune-modulating proteins more directly coupled to underlying mechanisms and signaling pathways are likely also involved. However, for the most part, clinical studies examining their relationship to post-stroke functional outcome remain scarce.\nWe recently profiled a broad range of inflammationrelated proteins (including chemokines, interleukins, surface molecules, and immune receptors) in relation to case control status in the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS) and found many to be associated with ischemic stroke and the main etiological subtypes [11]. Here, we leverage this data in an exploratory study with the primary aim to determine whether acutephase levels of any of these inflammation-related proteins are associated with 3-month functional outcome ischemic stroke, and to assess whether these associations are independent of established clinical predictors of stroke outcome. A secondary aim was to identify the proteins contributing most to the separation between favorable and unfavorable outcome, and to test their predictive accuracy. In addition to all ischemic stroke, we perform sex- and etiological subtype stratified analyses."

Acute ischemic stroke was defined as rapidly developing clinical signs of focal disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24\u00a0h without hemorrhage or signs of another cause on neuroimaging. All patients included in this study underwent imaging of the brain (computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance) as part of the clinical routine investigation. If clinically indicated, patients were also evaluated by angiography and perfusion measures. The patients underwent additional work-up according to national guidelines, and patients were excluded if further evaluation showed another etiology than stroke. Information regarding hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and medications was registered at the 3-month follow-up by examinations and a structured questionnaire, as described [12]. Signs of infection were identified by review of medical records as described [11]."

Platelet depleted plasma was isolated within 2\u00a0h by centrifugation 2000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00a0 \u00b0C for 20\u00a0 min, aliquoted, and stored at \u2212\u00a0 80\u00a0 \u00b0C. Plasma levels of inflammation-related proteins were analyzed using the Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I panel as described by Olink Bioscience (Uppsala, Sweden) [16]. This panel measures 92 proteins with documented or suggested involvement in inflammatory processes or diseases. Plasma samples were randomly distributed across plates and all protein analyses were performed by boardcertified laboratory technicians blinded to the clinical information.\nSixty-five proteins showed a pre-specified call rate of > 80% and were included in analyses, as described [11].

Normalization of data was performed in GenEx software using Olink Wizard\nproviding Normalized Protein eXpression (NPX) data on a Log2-scale, where one-unit higher NPX value represents a doubling of protein level [16]. Limit of detection (LOD) was reported by Olink for each protein assay and data below the LOD were replaced by LOD/2 for each protein. Of the 65 proteins analyzed, 54 proteins had no samples and three proteins had one sample below the LOD (CCL28, FGF-23, and MCP-4). The remaining 8 proteins had the number of samples below the LOD as follows: IL-7, n = 3; AXIN1, n = 10; CASP-8, n = 12; ENRAGE, n = 19; SLAMF1, n = 25; GDNF, n = 29; MCP-3, n = 82; and INF-gamma, n = 112.\nThe Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase (http:// geneo ntolo gy. org) was used to annotate biological process information [accessed May 2023]."

Olink analyses were run in two batches and ComBat adjustment was used (R package sva) to remove variation due to batch effect. Correlations between proteins were assessed by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients and hierarchical clustering was then performed to produce correlation plots.\nUnivariable binary logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals ([ORs and 95% CI]) for the associations between individual protein levels (NPX values) and unfavorable functional outcome. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, sex, day of blood draw, and diabetes mellitus (model 1) and additionally for stroke severity (model 2; covariables as in model 1 and stroke severity). These variables were chosen as they are either known to directly and independently associate to functional outcome after ischemic stroke (age, stroke severity, and diabetes mellitus); or may directly influence protein levels (sex and day of blood draw). As the NPX value is given on a log2 scale, the yielded OR corresponds to the predicted increased odds of suffering an unfavorable outcome per each doubling of the protein levels. Multiple testing was controlled for with the Benjamini and Hochberg (false discovery rate [FDR]) method in R using the p.adjust command. Associations with FDR < 0.05 were considered statistically significant and associations with FDR \u2265 0.05 but P < 0.05 were considered suggestive.\nLeast absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used to identify a subset\nof the 65 proteins that contributed the most to separation between outcome groups (R packages glmnet and caret). The optimal lambda value for each model was identified using repeated cross-validation (fivefold, repeated 20 times) and a grid search approach (lambda ranging from 0.0001 to 1) with a fixed alpha of 1. To assess the predictive accuracy of the LASSO selected proteins, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) for the multiprotein model as well as the individual proteins contributing to this model both with and without stroke severity (R packages pROC and caret).\nUnivariable and LASSO regressions as well as AUCs for the resulting multiprotein models were repeated after stratification by sex as well as the 4 main TOAST subtypes LAA, SAO, CE and cryptogenic stroke. We also performed sensitivity analyses excluding cases with signs of infection (n = 18), recurrent vascular events before the 3-month follow-up (n = 32), lipid-lowering treatment (n = 67), and cases who died during follow-up (i.e., mRS score 6, n = 5). For all stratified and sensitivity analyses P < 0.05 were considered significant.\nStatistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics 26 or R version 4.1.3, and all tests were 2-tailed.

In a final multivariable regression model, stroke severity was also adjusted for (model 2; Fig.\u00a0 1A). In this analysis 5 proteins were significantly associated (FDR < 0.05) and 12 were suggestively associated with outcome (Fig.\u00a0 1A and Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S2). The proteins with the largest effect sizes in multivariable analyses were TNFSF14 and TRAIL."

            "text": "In this explorative study of 65 proteins implicated in inflammation we identified many candidate plasma protein biomarkers associated with 3-month functional outcome after ischemic stroke, and for 5 proteins the association was independent of established clinical predictors of outcome, including stroke severity. Furthermore, LASSO regression identified 9 proteins that could best separate favorable and unfavorable outcome with an estimated diagnostic accuracy of 0.81. Elevated plasma levels of 3 proteins were associated with a more favorable outcome and 6 with less favorable outcome, consistent with inflammation having both detrimental and protective effects after cerebral ischemia. Finally, we identified\nsex- and etiologic subtype-specific associations. This was reflected also in the LASSO regressions, wherein different subsets of proteins best separated outcomes in the different patient strata.\nOur study validates findings for several inflammatory mediators from clinical or experimental studies in relation to stroke outcomes. Elevated IL-6 was associated with unfavorable outcome, in line with previous clinical studies [8, 17]. However, it is of note that IL-6 did not withstand correction for stroke severity in this study. EN-RAGE is a member of the S100 family of calciumbinding proteins and promotes inflammation and apoptosis through MAPK/ERK and NF-\u03baB signaling (Fig.\u00a0 3). Our results are in validation of two small clinical studies, where elevated EN-RAGE plasma protein levels (n = 171) [18] and S100A12 mRNA isolated from peripheral blood were associated with unfavorable 3-month functional outcome after stroke [19]. SIRT2 is an NAD + -dependent deacetylase highly expressed by both neurons and oligodendrocytes and has been implicated in regulating for instance apoptosis [20] and myelination (Fig.\u00a03) and is a known regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome [21] and MAPK signaling [22] (Fig.\u00a03). In animal models of stroke, SIRT2 inhibition showed neuroprotective effects [22], which is directionally consistent with our findings. Our results are concordant with a recent small study of 75 ischemic stroke patients in whom higher SIRT2 in serum exosomes was associated with unfavorable 3-month functional outcome [23]. We also identified TRAIL, a cytokine that plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis\n[24, 25] (Fig.\u00a03). In contrast to the proteins above, TRAIL has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in experimental models of cerebral ischemia [26]. This is analogous with what we observe here, where elevated TRAIL is associated with favorable outcome, and this is also in line with results for cardiovascular disease [25].\nNotably, we additionally provide novel data for several proteins without previous experimental or clinical support for a role in stroke outcomes. TNFSF14 is a transmembrane protein produced by activated T cells [27] and promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a0 3). It has a role in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease [28, 29]. In these diseases, blocking the interaction between TNFSF14 and its receptor has been shown to reduce inflammation and improve disease outcomes [29]. While studies on ischemic stroke outcomes are lacking, increased TNFSF14 predicts major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease [30], which is directionally concordant to what we observe here. 4EBP1 is a eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein, which plays a key role in translational regulation driven by the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway [31] (Fig.\u00a0 3). The stimulation of mTOR signaling after ischemic brain injury has several functions of plausible relevance for neural repair, such as promoting neural stem cell/progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, enhancing angiogenesis and synaptic plasticity [31] and targeting this pathway has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke [32]. CCL25 [alias TECK] is a chemokine that together with its receptor (CCR9) is involved in the regulation of immune cell migration and activation and plays a role in the development of T-cells. Decreased levels of CCL25 have been reported in a variety of inflammation-related diseases [33]. Here, for the first time, we report that elevated\nCCL25 levels are associated with favorable outcome after stroke. STAMBP [alias AMSH] is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is involved in the regulation of protein turnover and intracellular signaling (e.g., JAK/STAT pathway, Fig.\u00a0 3). STAMBP is a negative regulator of the NALP7 and NLRP3 inflammasomes [34, 35], the latter of which has been identified as a potential therapeutic target to reduce pro-inflammatory stress after stroke [36]. CSF-1, known as macrophage colony-stimulating factor is a primary driver of macrophage expansion in atherosclerosis [37]. Recently, genetically predicted higher CSF-1 was shown to associate with higher risk of ischemic stroke in a Mendelian randomization study, indicating a plausible causal role [38]. Here, we found that elevated acute phase CSF-1 is also associated with unfavorable outcome.\nUnderstanding differences in the inflammatory response during an acute ischemic stroke in different patient strata may help explain why certain subgroups of patients are at higher risk of experiencing unfavorable outcome and could provide insight into distinct mechanisms. We, therefore, performed analyses stratified for sex and TOAST subtype to identify putative sex- or etiology-specific biomarkers. In general, associations were directionally similar across strata with the largest number of significant associations being observed in men and in cardioembolic stroke. While the discriminative ability achieved in multiprotein models for men and women were similar, the range was wider for TOAST subtypes (highest AUC in cardioembolic followed by cryptogenic stroke) which may in part be attributable to sample sizes and initial stroke severity. Examples of strata-specific associations include elevated levels of 5 proteins associated with unfavorable outcome in women only. For GDNF [39], CCL3 [alias MIP-1\u03b1] [40], and CD40 [alias TNFSF5] [41] sex-differences have been observed in experimental or clinical studies. This was also reflected in the LASSO regressions, where GDNF, IL-10RB and SLAMF1 contributed to the separation of outcomes in women only. Other noteworthy protein associations include elevated CCL25, CD6, TRANCE and NT-3 associated with favorable and CDCP1 with unfavorable prognosis in cryptogenic stroke, all of which were selected by LASSO regression for cryptogenic stroke. Interestingly, TRANCE [alias TNFSF11, also known as RANKL] and its receptor (RANK) have been reported to attenuate ischemic brain injury through inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling [42]. Derivatives of RANKL already exist as therapeutic agents in bone remodeling [42] and novel partial agonists are also under exploration for stroke [43]. NT-3 is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which are important mediators of neuronal survival and regeneration, and one experimental study found that NT-3 improves recovery after cerebral\nischemia [44], which is directionally analogous to our finding. As these analyses were performed on small subgroups, future stratified analyses in larger ischemic stroke cohorts are clearly warranted.\nAs discussed above, some of the proteins that showed significant association to functional outcome after ischemic stroke in the present study have clinical or experimental support that is directionally concordant with our findings indicating that they are involved in pathways of importance for ischemic cerebral injury or repair. Mendelian randomization studies are, however, needed to infer possible causal relationships to outcome. In this context, should a causal relationship be found, it is of note that inflammation is currently considered a prime target for developing new stroke therapies to improve outcomes after stroke [4, 6, 7]. As there are several immunomodulating drugs already approved for treatment of inflammation-related diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease) and neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer\u2019s disease), there may be repurposing opportunities for stroke [7].\nThe principal strengths of the current study are the inclusion of consecutive and well-characterized ischemic stroke cases, and measurements of plasma proteins with a highly specific and sensitive multiplex method. There are several limitations that need to be considered. First, and as indicated above, although several proteins have previous clinical or experimental support as plausible candidates for stroke outcome, the present results need to be replicated in large cohorts. This is especially true for the stratified analyses, in which the sample sizes are limited. Second, as we measured plasma proteins using a multiplex assay, some important proteins (e.g., interferon gamma, IL-1, IL-4 and TNF-\u03b1) had a large proportion of samples below the detection limit. Third, in this exploratory study, protein levels were measured using a relative quantification, and thus direct comparisons to other studies using absolute quantification are not possible. In this context, while we provide preliminary AUC calculations for diagnostic accuracy of these proteins, the results need to be replicated with assays that enable determination of plasma protein concentration cut-offs. Fourth, it should be noted that the study participants of the present study are relatively young (< 70\u00a0years of age), and consequently a large proportion has mild stroke. This limits the generalizability to cohorts with later-onset ischemic stroke and more severe strokes. Finally, our results might not be extrapolated to populations of other ethnicities.\nIn conclusion, we identified multiple candidate plasma protein biomarkers of 3-month outcome after ischemic stroke involved in, e.g., NLRP3 inflammasome regulation and signaling pathways, such as TNF, JAK/STAT, MAPK, and NF-\u03baB. Several of these proteins have experimental\nevidence indicating a role in injury or recovery after stroke in support of our findings. These proteins warrant further study for stroke outcome prediction as well as investigations into the putative causal role for stroke outcome.\nAbbreviations CCL25 C\u2013C motif chemokine 25 [alias TEC protein tyrosine kinase, TECK] CE Cardioembolic stroke CSF-1 Colony stimulating factor 1 EN-RAGE Extracellular newly identified receptor for advanced glycation\nend-products binding protein [alias S100 calcium binding protein A12, S100A12]\nFDR False discovery rate IL Interleukin JAK/STAT Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription LAA Large artery atherosclerosis MAPK/ERK Mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase mRS Modified Rankin Scale mTOR Mammalian target of rapamycin NF-\u03baB Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells NIHSS National Institutes of Health stroke scale NLRP3 NOD-like receptor protein 3 SAO Small artery occlusion TOAST Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment TNF Tumor necrosis factor TNFSF14 TNF super family member 14 [alias homologous to lympho-\ntoxin, exhibits inducible expression and competes with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for herpes virus entry mediator, a receptor expressed by T cells, LIGHT]\nTRAIL TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand [alias TNF super family member 10, TNFSF10] 4EBP1 Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12974- 023- 02912-9.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
