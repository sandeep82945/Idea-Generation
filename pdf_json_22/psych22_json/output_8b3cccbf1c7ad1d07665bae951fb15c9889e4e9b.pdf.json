    "abstractText": "Globally, the burden of overweight and obesity is a major cardiovascular disease risk factor and is even higher among patients with psychiatric disorders compared to the general population. This is mainly due to the deleterious lifestyles characterized by physical inactivity, excessive substance use, and unhealthy diets common among patients with psychiatric disorders, as well as the negative metabolic effects of psychotropic medications. Despite these conditions being a high burden among patients with psychiatric illness, little attention is given to them during routine reviews in psychiatric clinics in most African nations, including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate and compare the prevalence of and associated risk factors for overweight and obesity among patients with psychiatric illnesses.",

            "text": "Obesity/overweight have reached an epidemic burden globally, with at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese [1]. According to World Health Organization (WHO) European Region, an estimated 23% of women and 20% of men are obese or overweight [2]. The magnitude of overweight and obesity among adults in Africa is 27% and 8% respectively [3] and the report from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey(EDHS) the burden of overweight/obesity is 8% [4]. Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Obesity is frequently accompanied by depression, and the two can trigger and influence each other. Obesity and overweight are major public health issues, as well as the leading preventable cause of death in both developed and developing countries [5].\nA study has shown that the burden of obesity reveals that more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 and older were overweight in 2014; over 600 million were obese; 39% of adults aged 18 and over were overweight, and 13% were obese [6]. Overweight and obesity are on the rise worldwide, not only in the general population but also in psychiatric patients. The major causes of overweight and obesity are not clear but are considered multi-disciplinary and related to genetic, metabolic, and psychological factors [7, 8].\nThe relationship between abnormal body weight and psychiatric disorders has continuous,\ncomplex relations that are still being debated. Some scholars suggest that overweight/obesity may cause common psychiatric disorders, whereas others have found that psychiatric patients are more prone to obesity [9, 10]. A community-based study of Saudi Arabian university students showed that obesity and overweight were positively associated with several mental disorders, especially mood disorders and anxiety disorders [11]. Another study done in Egypt showed that the prevalence of obesity and overweight in psychiatric patients was 66.93% (22.31% were obese, and 44.62% were overweight). The prevalence of obesity was highest in bipolar disorder (41.38%), followed by depression (37.93%), schizophrenia (10.34%), anxiety disorder (6.9%), and finally substance abuse disorder (3.45%), but the difference was not statistically significant. There was a significant correlation between the sociodemographic characteristics of patients with obesity and the distribution of psychiatric disorders [12].\nIn developing countries, along with economic development and income growth, the num-\nber of people who are overweight or obese is increasing. Among the reasons for the increasing obesity in the population of poor people are higher unemployment, lower education level, irregular meals, and low physical activity, which among the poor is associated with a lack of money for sports equipment [13]. In spite of such a burden of overweight/obesity in the community, there is no available scientific data in our region, Ethiopia. Thus, the purpose of this\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264461 March 2, 2022 2 / 10\nFunding: The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nAbbreviations: AOR, adjusted odds ratio; BMI, body mass index; COR, crude odds ratio; WHO, World Health Organization.\nstudy is to compare the prevalence of overweight/obesity in patients with severely ill psychiatric patients at an Eastern Ethiopia psychiatric center as compared to non-exposed controls. The authors hypothesized that the prevalence would be higher in patients with psychiatric disorders. This study also determined the associated factors of overweight/obesity."

A total sample of 192 study participants (96 psychiatric patients and 96 non-psychiatric individuals) was endorsed after considering a 10% non-response rate [16, 17]. All psychiatric patients were selected using consecutive sampling techniques.

Ever consumer / consumer of any alcohol represents current alco-\nholic drinker (past 30 days) which is coded as (0 = No and 1 = Yes) and past alcoholic drinker (drank in the past 12 months) which is coded as (0 = No and 1 = Yes) [21].\nData collection tools and procedures\nAfter the interview, anthropometric measurements were performed. The height and weight of each subject were measured by using a scale to the nearest 1 cm and 1 kg, respectively. The height of a subject was measured by using an erect height measuring scale. Measurements of height were made with the subject\u2019s bare feet. The subjects stood straight against the erect measuring scale, and their heads, shoulders, buttocks, and heels touched the scale. The subject\u2019s axis of vision was horizontal. Then, they took a deep breath to relax their shoulders. With a flat object, the upper level of their heads was marked against the scale and measured to the nearest 1 cm. Weight was measured using a weighing scale with light clothing and without shoes."

This study is consistent with the findings reported from the United States, where patients with severe psychiatric disorders had a higher average BMI than the subjects in the general population controls(32.11, SD = 7.72vs 27.62, SD = 5.93, P = 0.000) in 2017 [22], and in Egypt by Ahmed Kamel et al., in 2016 [12]. However, the current study has a higher prevalence of overweight/obesity as compared to the WHO report in 2016 [6] and by Mekonnen et al. in 2018 [23]. This could be due to variations in study participants (in our study, the study participants were severely ill psychiatric patients) and lifestyle and physical activity differences.\nFurthermore, the current study shows a higher prevalence of overweight/obesity among\nthose with major depressive disorders (MDD) as compared to schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. This finding is supported by previous studies done in the Campania region by Micanti F, Pecoraro G, Mosca P, et al., 2017 [24] and in McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA, USA by Chouinard, V.-A., et al. [25] and Francesco Weiss, Margherita et al. 2020 [26]. This is partly explained by depressed patients reduced physical activity, which results in positive energy balance and overweight/obesity disorders. Many people who have difficulty recovering from sudden or emotionally draining events unknowingly begin eating too much of the wrong foods or forgoing exercise [27]. Mechanisms underlying this weight gain include lifestyle and environmental factors and psychiatric medications, though emerging evidence has also suggested the role of genetic and neuroendocrine processes [28]. The current study also, found that education status, employment, and increased duration of psychiatric illness were significant predictor of obesity/overweight among psychiatric patients. The current study also found that education status, employment, and increased duration of psychiatric illness were significant predictors of obesity/overweight among psychiatric patients. This finding is consistent with the study conducted by Husky et al. in 2017 [29, 30]."

The magnitudes of overweight and obesity were significantly higher among the severely ill psychiatric group (43.8%) than in non-exposed controls (20.80%). It was found that educational status, unemployment, and late stages of the disease were significant predictors of overweight or obesity. Clinicians should be aware of the health consequences of overweight and obesity and consider instituting targeted weight treatment programs as a part of routine psychiatric care. This is strongly recommended. The current study also found that education status, non-employment, and the late stage of psychiatric diseases were significant predictors of obesity and overweight. Physicians should be aware of the health consequences of obesity and should consider instituting targeted weight treatment programs as a part of routine psychiatric care.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264461 March 2, 2022 8 / 10"
