    "abstractText": "Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 converts intermittent renewable electricity into value-added liquid products with an enticing prospect, but its practical application is hampered due to the lack of high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, we elaborately design and develop strongly coupled nanosheets composed of Ag nanoparticles and Sn\u2013SnO2 grains, designated as Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 nanosheets (NSs), which possess optimized electronic structure, high electrical conductivity, and more accessible sites. As a result, such a catalyst exhibits unprecedented catalytic performance toward CO2-to-formate conversion with near-unity faradaic efficiency (\u2265 90%), ultrahigh partial current density (2,000 mA  cm\u22122), and superior long-term stability (200 mA  cm\u22122, 200 h), surpassing the reported catalysts of CO2 electroreduction to formate. Additionally, in situ attenuated total reflection-infrared spectra combined with theoretical calculations revealed that electron-enriched Sn sites on Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs not only promote the formation of *OCHO and alleviate the energy barriers of *OCHO to *HCOOH, but also impede the desorption of H*. Notably, the Ag/ Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs as the cathode in a membrane electrode assembly with porous solid electrolyte layer reactor can continuously produce ~ 0.12 M pure HCOOH solution at 100 mA cm\u22122 over 200 h. This work may inspire further development of advanced electrocatalysts and innovative device systems for promoting practical application of producing liquid fuels from CO2.",

Particularly, metal groups as moderator not only optimize the electronic structure of active sites, but also boost significantly its electrical conductivity. As the highest electrical conductivity of all metals, Ag (6.30 \u00d7 107\u00a0S\u00a0 m\u20131 at 20\u00a0\u2103) is frequently utilized as a main constituent to increase the electrical conductivity of electrocatalysts [24\u201328], and its work function of 4.26\u00a0eV is also different from both Sn (4.42\u00a0eV) and SnO2 (5.24\u00a0eV) [29\u201331], which allows the possibility of manipulating the electronic configuration and electrical conductivity of Sn\u2013SnO2 spontaneously. Moreover, the increasing number of actives sites, such as the construction of lowdimensional electrodes with more accessibility of catalytic sites, not only enhanced utilization of active centers, but also favored penetration of ions, promoted mass transport of gas, and thus ultimately improved the overall electrocatalytic performance [32, 33]. Consequently, we speculate that assembly of Sn\u2013SnO2 units and metal Ag with delicately tuned electronic regulation could generate a significant synergistic effect for an efficient CO2RR.\nAnother prominent challenge that goes beyond the scope of electrocatalysts lies in the liquid products inevitably existing in a mixture with solutes in liquid electrolytes. In a conventional liquid electrolyte, KHCO3 or KOH as commonly solutes ensure fast ion conduction between the cathode and anode to obtain low ohmic drop [34]. The budding solid-state batteries adopt ion-conducting solid polymers or ceramics as alternatives of solution electrolyte to assist ions shuttle between anode and cathode [35, 36]. Motivated by this chemical principle, it is urgent to seek innovative electrolytes to replace typical soluble electrolytes, avoid energyintensive separation, and produce pure fuel solution directly from CO2 electrolysers. An integration of rational design in both catalysts and electrolytes, for high activity and pure fuel output, respectively, would help to push the generation of liquid fuels via the CO2RR closer to large-scale application.\nTo support this hypothesis, herein, we designed and synthesized strongly coupled Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs through selftemplating transformation and electrochemical reduction strategy. Benefiting from the optimized electronic structure, superior electrical conductivity, and abundant accessible sites, the obtained Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs can accomplish notable performance with an ampere-level current densities (2000\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u20132) and near-unity selectivity over 90% for CO2 electroreduction to formate production, which is"

            "text": "The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) technology provides an elegant route toward a carbon\u2013neutral energy cycle, which addresses the requirements for storage of renewable energy in valuable carbon-based chemicals and fuels [1\u20133]. Liquid products have a higher volumetric energy density by contrast with gaseous-phase products, enabling them easier to store and distribute [4]. In particular, formate or formic acid (HCOOH) as an important feedstock is widely utilized in pharmaceutical, antiseptics, electrolytic metallurgy, and leather [5]. Unfortunately, to date, the reported electrocatalysts have all failed in commercialization requirements of CO2RR with Faradaic efficiency (FE) beyond 90%, partial current density close to 1\u00a0A\u00a0 cm\u20132, and long-term operation of at least 100\u00a0h [6, 7]. Moreover, the generated liquid product was usually mixed with soluble electrolytes in typical H-type or flow-type reactor [8], requiring extra energy-intensive downstream separation process to purify the liquid fuel solution for practical applications. Thus, it is urgently desirable to explore highly efficient electrocatalysts and develop insoluble electrolyte systems to achieve commercial-grade liquid fuel products.\nOver the past decades, Sn-, Bi-, Pb-, and In-based electrocatalysts have been widely exploited for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid/formate [9\u201312]. Among these, Sn-based electrocatalysts are considered as the most promising candidates because of their low toxicity, large abundance, and low cost [13, 14]. However, owing to their medium binding energy to *H derived from HER, CO2 conversion over metal Sn is difficult to obtain desirable FEformate [15]. Besides, large overpotential was required to overcome the barrier associated with the initial electron transfer to CO2 form the CO2* intermediate due to poor electrical conductivity [16, 17]. Recently, it was reported that Sn\u2013SnO2 derived from oxidized Sn or reduced SnO2 exhibits improved formate selectivity compared to bare Sn, arising from formation of oxygen vacancies or structural defects to enhance the stabilization of CO2RR intermediates [18, 19]. Nevertheless, Sn\u2013SnO2 catalysts only achieved high FEformate in a narrow potential window and always delivered lower current density.\nAs known, the product selectivity is mainly related to the electronic configuration of the active sites in electrocatalysts. By reasonably combining foreign metal or non-metal components, it is capable of tailoring interaction between the\n1 3\nmuch superior to previous reports. Meanwhile, it is also continuous to operate with high FEformate at a current density of 200\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u20132 for 200\u00a0h. The in\u00a0situ attenuated total reflection-infrared (ATR-IR) spectra and theoretical analysis unraveled that coupling of Ag NPs induces the electronic enrichment of the Sn sites on Sn\u2013SnO2 and thereby promotes generation of the crucial *OCHO intermediate and reduces energy barrier of *OCHO to *HCOOH conversion. In addition, to solve the downstream separation cost, porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer was introduced into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactor, in which the Ag/ Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs as cathode catalyst can continuously reduce CO2 to ~ 0.12 M pure HCOOH solution for 200\u00a0h. This work could highlight significant understandings in both the development of advanced catalysts and superior devices for carbon\u2013neutral technologies."

            "text": "The silver\u2013tin bimetallic NSs, synthesized by utilizing SnS2 NSs as self-templates, were characterized. Typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images (Figs.\u00a02a, b and S2a\u2013d) demonstrate that the morphology of SnS2 NSs remains unchanged after Ag+ ion-exchange reactions. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)\nspectrum combined with corresponding mapping images (Fig.\u00a0S2e, f) confirm that the Ag element was successfully introduced into SnS2 NSs with uniform distribution. After the pyrolysis in O2 atmosphere, the bimetallic sulfide was transformed into the hybrid Ag2SO4/SnO2. The morphology and structure of the Ag2SO4/SnO2 composite were examined by TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). As shown in Figs.\u00a02c and S3a, b, some nanoparticles with ~ 10\u201320\u00a0nm in diameter emerge from nanosheets composed of small grains connected each other. Based on the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig.\u00a0S3c), two kinds of diffraction rings were found, including the (110), (200), (211), and (301) planes of cubic SnO2, and the (200) plane of orthorhombic Ag2SO4. HRTEM image and corresponding fast Fourier transform pattern reveal that the nanoparticle is Ag2SO4, which is surrounded by many SnO2 grains (Fig.\u00a0S3d\u2013f). EDX mapping images show these Ag2SO4 NPs separately embedded into SnO2 NSs (Fig.\u00a0S3g). Besides, their crystal structure and surface statement of Ag2SO4/SnO2 were also further characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technology (Fig.\u00a0S4).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01264-6\u00a9 The authors\nTo obtain Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs, the as-synthesized Ag2SO4/ SnO2 precursor was dispersed and pasted on carbon paper and subjected to \u2212 1.8\u00a0V versus RHE for 60\u00a0min in CO2-saturated 0.5\u00a0M KHCO3 electrolyte. After the electrochemical conversion, the catalyst was collected for further characterization. PXRD pattern unveils that Ag2SO4 was completely transformed into Ag in the electrocatalysts, while SnO2 was partially reduced to Sn metal (Fig.\u00a0S5). As shown in Fig.\u00a02d, no obvious change in morphology is observed after the electroreduction of Ag2SO4/SnO2 NSs, and the derived Ag NPs are still separately located in the\nnanosheets that are composed of Sn\u2013SnO2 grains with ~ 5.6\u00a0nm in size (Fig.\u00a02e, f). HRTEM image (Fig.\u00a02g) distinctly shows a region of interfacial contact among three different crystal planes with lattice spacings of about 0.24, 0.29 and 0.34\u00a0nm, belonging to the (111) plane of Ag, the (200) plane of Sn, and the (110) plane of SnO2, respectively. The derived Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs possess intimate interfaces of Ag and Sn\u2013SnO2, which was also confirmed by corresponding EDX mapping images and EDX line scans (Figs.\u00a02h and S6). The Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs were also prepared for comparison through the similar procedure (Figs.\u00a0S7 and S8). Further\n1 3\ninsight into the chemical states of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs was obtained by XPS. As shown in Fig.\u00a0S9a, Ag 3d spectrum for Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs fits well with two pairs of characteristic peaks at 368.1 and 373.9\u00a0eV, and 367.6 and 373.6\u00a0eV, which can be assigned to metal Ag and Ag+, respectively [42]. As for Sn 3d spectrum in Fig.\u00a0S9b, the two sets of doublet peaks for Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 at the binding energy of 484.9 and 494.2\u00a0eV together with 486.1 and 494.8\u00a0eV ascribe to metal Sn and Sn4+, respectively [43]. Obviously, the binding energy of Sn 3d in Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs negatively shifted 0.15\u00a0eV compared to that of Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs, indicating the electronic interaction between the Ag NPs and the Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs.\nIn order to deeply investigate the effect of Ag NPs on the electronic and coordination structure of Sn\u2013SnO2, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was carried out. The XANES spectra of the Ag K-edge in different samples (Fig.\u00a03a) show that the adsorption edges of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2, Ag2O, and Ag foil are very close to each other. The magnified image (inset in Fig.\u00a03a) shows that Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 exhibits a tendency for the pre-edge feature to shift to Ag2O, compared with the Ag foil. The K3-weighted EXAFS spectra of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 in Fig.\u00a03b show that the two main peaks correspond to Ag\u2013O and Ag\u2013Ag (Ag-Sn) bonds compared to Ag2O and Ag foil. It is worth noting that the interatomic distance of the Ag\u2013Ag bond (2.92\u00a0\u00c5) in Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 is slightly longer than that of Ag foil (2.86\u00a0\u00c5) due to the formation of Ag-Sn bonding, which is further verified by the Ag K-edge EXAFS fitting results displayed in Figs.\u00a0S10 and S11 and Table\u00a0S1. In the XANES spectra of the Sn K-edge (Fig.\u00a03c), the edge position of Sn\u2013SnO2 and Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 located between those of Sn foil and SnO2, and Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 shifted to lower energy compared with Sn\u2013SnO2, suggesting their decreased congruity in the coordination environment. To further illustrate the fine structure of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2, their XANES spectra are compared and shown in Fig.\u00a03d, in which the peaks at 1.34 and 2.42\u00a0\u00c5 are attributed to the Sn\u2013O bond and Sn\u2013Sn (Sn\u2013Ag) interaction, respectively. A slight compression of the Sn\u2013Sn bond derives from the difference between the atomic radii of Sn and Ag, further confirming their successful alloying. The wavelet transform analysis also confirmed the different coordination of Sn atom between the Sn\u2013SnO2 and Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 samples (Fig.\u00a03e). According to the Sn K-edge EXAFS fitting curves (Table\u00a0S2), it is noticed that the average coordination numbers of Sn\u2013O (3.7), Sn\u2013Ag (2.0), and Sn\u2013Sn (2.1) in Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 are obviously less than those of Sn\u2013O (4.7)\nand Sn\u2013Sn (3.1) in Sn\u2013SnO2, implying the emergence of coordinatively unsaturated Sn sites after the coupling of Ag. Usually, these unsaturated metal atoms would cause structural distortions or defects, leading to greatly modified electronic properties. The work functions of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 and Sn\u2013SnO2 were further investigated to clarify the difference in their electronic properties by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Sn in Sn\u2013SnO2 is easily oxidized back to SnO2 during the UPS preparation, so that the work function of Sn\u2013SnO2 (5.17\u00a0eV) does not obviously decrease compared to that of SnO2. In contrast to transition metal, noble metal Ag is difficult to be oxidized, and the coupled Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 displays a markedly lower work function (4.73\u00a0eV). Thus, Ag NPs would transfer electrons to Sn\u2013SnO2, which is further confirmed by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test (Fig.\u00a0S13), inducing an upshift of the Fermi level of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 (Fig.\u00a03f). Briefly, it is concluded that the introduction of Ag into Sn\u2013SnO2 facilitates the electron transfer from Ag atoms to Sn atoms in Sn\u2013SnO2, leading to electron enrichment in Sn\u2013SnO2 surfaces (Fig.\u00a03g)."

As shown in Fig.\u00a04a, the current densities of Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs are enhanced with the combination of Ag NPs, and it exhibits considerable current densities of 69\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122 compared to Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs with 29.5\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122 at \u20131.37\u00a0V. The promotion of current density by Ag coupling was further confirmed by the linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) curves in Ar-saturated KHCO3 electrolyte. The products of CO2RR were quantitatively analyzed at different potentials between \u2212 0.67 and \u2212 1.37\u00a0V over Sn\u2013SnO2, and Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs (Figs.\u00a0S14\u2013S16). Figure\u00a04b shows that the FEformate of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs can remain above 90% in a wide range of potentials from \u20130.87 to \u20131.37\u00a0V with the maximum value of ~ 93% at \u2212 1.17\u00a0V, which is 1.2 times larger than that of Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs (78%). When bare Ag NPs were utilized as electrocatalysts, only conversion of CO2 toward CO was achieved (Fig.\u00a0S16). We further calculated the partial current density of formate (jformate) for Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 and Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs at all of applied potentials.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01264-6\u00a9 The authors\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a04c, Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 is capable of delivering a jformate of about 48.5\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122 at \u2212 1.37\u00a0V, which is about 3 times higher than that of Sn\u2013SnO2 (16\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122). Besides, the effect of Ag content in Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs on the performance of CO2 reduction was also investigated (Fig.\u00a0S17). With the increase of Ag content, the current density increases from 30 to 67\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122 and then decrease to 58\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122. The corresponding FEformate also follows volcanic-like trend at the applied potential of \u2212 1.27\u00a0V, which may be due to that part of the Ag, which is not in close contact with Sn\u2013SnO2, tends to reduce CO2 to CO.\nTo decipher the origin of high activities of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs, their double layer capacitances (CdI) were estimated according to corresponding electrochemically active surface areas (Fig.\u00a0S18a). The CdI of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 and Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs were calculated to be 1.62 and 0.66\u00a0mF\u00a0 cm\u22122, respectively, illustrating that the Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs can provide more active sites. The CdI-normalized jformate value of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs was larger than that of Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs (Fig.\u00a0S18b), elucidating Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs with improved intrinsic activity by incorporation of Ag NPs. To gain insight into the reaction kinetics, the Tafel slopes of the catalysts were plotted in Fig.\u00a0S18c. The Tafel slope of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs (107.2\u00a0mV\n1 3\ndec\u20131) is lower than that of Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs (172.8\u00a0mV\u00a0 dec\u20131), indicating the favorable kinetic activity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate over Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs. Moreover, multi-step proton\u2013electron coupling is involved in the reduction of CO2, and the charge transfer process from catalysts to intermediates was also investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). By contrast, Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs have a smaller impedance value of ~ 10\u00a0\u03a9 compared to Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs (~ 60\u00a0\u03a9) (Fig.\u00a0S18d), implying\ngood electrical conductivity, which confirms that after combination with Ag, the charge transfer resistance of Sn\u2013SnO2 is significantly decreased and thus promotes the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the oxidative LSV scans under Arbubbled KOH electrolyte further displayed that the potential for OH\u2013 adsorption on the Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs surface was more negative than that of Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs, suggesting its most powerful ability to stabilize the CO2*\u2212 intermediate (Fig.\u00a0S19). To the best of our knowledge, Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01264-6\u00a9 The authors\nexceed previously reported Sn-based electrocatalysts for formate production by CO2RR in H-type reactor (Fig.\u00a0S20 and Table\u00a0S3). In addition, Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs also exhibits good stability with high FEformate during a 25-h potentiostatic test (Fig.\u00a0S21). After the long-term test, no obvious changes in crystallinity, surface statement, and morphology for the Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs are observed (Fig.\u00a0S22), elucidating their good activity and stability.\nGas diffusion electrode (GDE) can overcome mass-transfer limitation of CO2 due to its low solubility in aqueous solution and promotes the realization of the industriallevel current density, and the CO2RR performance of Ag/ Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs was further measured in a flow-type reactor (Fig.\u00a0S23). Figures\u00a04d and S24 show that Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs gave above 90% FEformate over a wide potential window from \u20130.43 to \u20132.02\u00a0V, while Sn\u2013SnO2 delivered lower formate selectivity as it failed to suppress competitive HER. By contrast, Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs achieved an ultrahigh formate partial current density of 2000\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u20132 at \u20132.01\u00a0V, outperforming most of the advanced electrocatalysts for formate generation by CO2RR (Figs.\u00a04d and S24f). In the meantime, Ag/ Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs manifested a higher cathodic energy efficiency (CEE) than that of Sn\u2013SnO2 for reduction of CO2 to formate (Fig.\u00a04e). To further intuitively evaluate the efficiency of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs, the corresponding formate yield at the selected potentials per unit catalyst load area and time was also calculated. As shown in Fig.\u00a04f, the yield of formate for Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs increased with the increase of applied potential, and the value reached 33.5\u00a0mol\u00a0 h\u20131\u00a0 cm\u20131 at 2.02\u00a0V. Moreover, the long-term stability a CO2RR electrocatalyst is another prerequisite for its practical implementation. Correspondingly, the constant-current electrolysis of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs at the current density of 200\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u20132 in the flow-type reactor was operated and is displayed in Fig.\u00a04g. Clearly, no obvious increase in potential was noticed after 200\u00a0h continuous electrolysis. Meanwhile, an excellent formate selectivity was well maintained, illustrating the industrial superiority and feasibility of the Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs at such a large current density. Such remarkable catalytic performance of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs is the best one among those reported catalysts of CO2 electroreduction to formate (Fig.\u00a04h and Table\u00a0S4)."

As shown in Fig.\u00a05a, an upward peak at 1401\u00a0 cm\u20131 is assigned to the *OCHO group [9, 10], and another downward peak at 1630\u00a0 cm\u22121 is ascribed to interfacial H2O [44, 45], implying that the *OCHO intermediate was generated while the absorbed H2O molecules were participated for Sn\u2013SnO2. Remarkably, the consumption of interfacial H2O is equivalent to the formation of *OCHO, implying that the reduction of CO2 is accompanied by significant H2 evolution. By integrated Ag NPs in Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs, the consumption of absorbed H2O characteristic band is obviously suppressed (Fig.\u00a05b), and corresponding relative peak area ratio of *OCHO/H2O for Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 is bigger than Sn\u2013SnO2 (Fig.\u00a05c), which clarifies that Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 can effectively weaken the formation of H2 and promote the reduction of CO2. A weak peak belonging to *COOH group was observed at 1268\u00a0 cm\u22121 [46], because the uncovered Ag in Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs prefer to bond the formation of CO intermediate (Fig.\u00a05b).

As shown in Fig.\u00a05d, the formation of intermediate HCOO* is an exothermic process, and Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 occupies obviously lower key *OCHO intermediate formation energy compared to Sn\u2013SnO2. The transformation of *OCHO to *HCOOH is the most endothermic on both systems and uphill energy on Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 is smaller than that on Sn\u2013SnO2 (0.82 vs. to 0.98\u00a0eV), indicating that HCOOH formation on Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 is more favorable.

Charge density difference plots of OCHO adsorption on Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 and Sn\u2013SnO2 are presented in Fig.\u00a05e. Notably, charge redistribution over Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 is the more significant, rationalizing the stronger adsorption. Moreover, Bader charge analysis reveals that the *OCHO species on Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 obtains a charge of 0.690\u00a0|e|, which is greater than that (0.686\u00a0|e|) on Sn\u2013SnO2, indicating that\nthe electrons of Sn atoms in Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 are easily transferred to *OCHO. In addition, as main side reaction, HER was also studied (Fig.\u00a0S27), and the free energy profiles are displayed in Fig.\u00a05f. The uphill free energy of the desorption of *H to H2 on Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 surface is much higher than that on Sn\u2013SnO2 (Fig.\u00a05f), suggesting the superior inhibition of H2 production. Overall, both experimental and theoretical results elucidate that the coupled Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 with electron-rich Sn sites not only facilitates the successive hydrogenation of *CO2 to *OCHO to *HCOOH, but also\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01264-6\u00a9 The authors\nfurther hinders H2 formation, thus resulting in enhancement selectivity of formate in a wide range of potential (Fig.\u00a05g).\nUp to now, although formate can be exclusively generated via a CO2RR approach with high-performance electrocatalysts, the as-obtained products were in low concentrations actually and mixed with solute salts, which requires extra separation and concentration treatments to obtain pure liquid fuel for subsequent applications. To promote large-scale application of producing liquid fuels from CO2RR pathway, porous solid electrolytes (PSE) is employed to replace watersoluble electrolytes and achieve direct synthesis of pure liquid acid solution. PSE layer can efficiently deliver ions between the cathode and anode, but does not introduce additional solutes to mix with produced HCOOH. As shown in Figs.\u00a06a and S28, the cathode and anode of PSE layer are Ag/ Sn\u2013SnO2-coated GDE and Ti mesh-supported IrO2, which\nsandwiched cation exchange membranes (CEMs) and anion exchange membranes (AEMs), respectively. The cathode side was uninterruptedly supplied with humidified CO2 flow for CO2RR, and generated HCOO\u2212 ions on Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 were driven to pass through the AEM and arrive the middle PSE layer by the electrical field. Meanwhile, the anode side was circulated with 0.1\u00a0M H2SO4 solution for water oxidation, and H+ generated on IrO2 moved through the CEM into the middle PSE layer. In the middle chamber, a PSE layer facilitated ion transportation with minimized ohmic losses, and the HCOOH molecules formed via the ionic recombination were then efficiently brought out through this porous layer via the flow of deionized (DI) water or N2 vapor.\nThe LSV curve of CO2RR in a 2\u00a0 cm2 Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2//PSE// IrO2 cell plotted in Fig.\u00a0S29a shows that the overall current density gradually increases as the cell voltage ramps up. The\n1 3\nselectivity of HCOOH in the PSE-cell follows volcanic-like trend and max FEHCOOH reaches up to 83% (Figs.\u00a06b and S29b), but their value is lower compared to results of typical reactors, which rooted in the different pH (acidic pH in MEA with PSE and neutral/alkaline pH in H-type/flow-type reactor, respectively) and the liquid product distribution. With the increase of current density, corresponding concentration of HCOOH solution varies from 15 to 130\u00a0mM at this deionized (DI) water flow rate (Fig.\u00a06b), and maximum partial current density is 350\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122 (Fig.\u00a0S29c). To further improve concentration of the generated HCOOH, humidified N2 was employed to replace the DI water to carry HCOOH molecules in PSE layer. As shown in Fig.\u00a0S29d, the overall current density also reaches 1000\u00a0mA with a fixed N2 flow rate of 100\u00a0sccm. It is observed in Figs.\u00a06c and S29e that FEHCOOH also follows a trend of rising up first and then falling down, but the concentration of HCOOH is significantly improved under the same current, and corresponding current density can reach 270\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122 (Fig.\u00a0S29f).\nIn view of the advantage of producing high-concentration HCOOH solution with humidified N2 flow, a long-term electrolysis experiment was also implemented to realize the continuous production of pure HCOOH solution. However, it was noticed that the cell voltage was apparently increased to maintain the current of 200\u00a0mA as the electrolysis time was prolonged (Fig.\u00a06d), which is mainly attributed to the gradual degradation of membranes and solid electrolytes without enough wetting conditions [47]. Because it is difficult to prevent the degradation of AEM on the current technical level, DI water as a substitute was utilized to explore the durability of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 for long-term operation at the same current for reduction of CO2 to pure HCOOH with a lower flow rate of 20\u00a0mL\u00a0 h\u22121. Strikingly, a stable production of ~ 0.1\u00a0M pure HCOOH was achieved at a large current density of 100\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122 during 200\u00a0h continuous electrolysis periods (Fig.\u00a06e). Such unparalleled activity, yield, and excellent long-term stability for reduction of CO2 to pure HCOOH surpass previous reports (Table\u00a0S5). Consequently, the exceptional results of Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 present promising prospect of commercial production of pure HCOOH from CO2."

On account of its\nregulated electron configuration and superior electrical conductivity, the Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs with ample accessible sites as electrocatalysts are capable of exhibiting a combination of high activity and stability in the CO2-to-formate reduction exceeding 200\u00a0h of continuous operation, outperforming most of reported Sn-based electrocatalysts. Moreover, operando ATR-IR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of Ag NPs into Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs can promote the formation of the *OCHO, alleviate the energy barriers of *OCHO to *HCOOH, and suppress the competitive H2 production. Additionally, Ag/Sn\u2013SnO2 NSs as the cathode in a MEA with PSE reactor enable the direct production of ~ 0.12\u00a0M pure HCOOH solution for 200\u00a0h. The momentous achievements in this work would be indicative to integrating the electrode materials and electrolytic systems for accelerating the practical application of carbon\u2013neutral technologies.\nAcknowledgements This work was financially supported from the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Grant No. 52125103), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 52301232, 52071041, 12074048, and 12147102), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2022M720552).
