One key element in this development is the embedded electronic readout layers including surface mounted SiPMs, allowing for highly granular calorimeter layers with a compact front-end readout design. The latest Analogue Hadron Calorimeter (AHCAL) technological prototype features a total of \u223c22000 SiPM-on-tile channels [3]. For this large amount of channels an extensive commissioning and characterisation campaign was required. Based on the determined excellent intrinsic SiPM parameter uniformity, a fully automated temperature compensation scheme for the bias voltage of the SiPMs has been implemented. During various beam test campaigns at the CERN SPS in 2018 this scheme allowed for an uniform and stable detector operation and performance."

            "text": "During the construction and commissioning phase of the calorimeter system in 2017/2018 the individual components were extensively tested and characterised before being assembled. In total 39 batches with 600 SiPMs each were delivered. Each batch was ordered with a required breakdown voltage uniformity of \u00b1100 mV. For SiPM quality assurance and in order to prove the outstanding parameter homogeneity within the SiPM batches a dedicated test bench setup at the university of Heidelberg has been used [5]. In a spot test procedure 24 SiPMs per batch were extensively characterised on the test bench, while the remaining 576 SiPMs were used for one calorimeter layer. In a first step, basic parameters for all spot test SiPMs were measured, which were well satisfying all defined requirements like a dark count rate lower than 500 kHz or a gain higher than 3 \u00d7 105. By scanning the point of breakdown voltage for each spot test SiPM, a mean minmax variation of \u223c150 mV per batch was found, see Fig. 2. Four batches showed a larger min-max difference than \u223c200 mV, however, only caused by one outlier SiPM per batch. This excellent homogeneity is reflected by the measured mean gain uniformity of 1.8 % for SiPMs of the same batch, as depicted in Fig. 3, allowing to build homogenous calorimeter layers with SiPMs of the same batch without having to test and characterise each individual device."

In total it features 21888 SiPM-on-tile channels. Each layer (Fig. 5) consists of 576 SiPMs operated at the same bias voltage and read out by 16 ASICs, which allows for an internal amplification and digitisation of the SiPMs analog signals [6].\nThe integration into the active detector volume and the capability to operate in power-pulsed mode for a reduced power consumption are key features of the compact front-end readout electronics [7]. Additionally, temperature sensors are implemented in each layer and\nthe detector has an integrated low intensity and shortpulsed LED system for the channel-wise calibration of the SiPM gain by measuring the single photon spectrum in-situ. During extensive beam test campaigns at SPS CERN and DESY, the detector system has proven stable and well controlled operation and data acquisition. Tens of millions of single particle events (muons, electrons, pions) have been recorded for sophisticated physics analyses, like the details of the particle shower development in the calorimeter. Due to the large number of channels in transversal and longitudinal direction these details can be resolved appropriately demonstrating the imaging capabilities of the system."

            "text": "In order to ensure system stability and to monitor the performance of all individual SiPMs, a daily in-situ LED gain calibration has been performed during beam test operation. The calibration procedure aims to determine the gain of each SiPM by measuring the distance between the equidistant single photon peaks in the single photon spectrum, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. The analog output signals of the SIPMs are amplified as well as digitised in the ASIC readout chips. Therefore, for monitoring purposes the gain is expressed in ADC (analogue-to-digital-counts) units, representing the intrinsic SiPM gain folded with the amplification factor of the chip component and the subsequent digitisation. More than 99.9 % of the channels are determined to be fully functional, typically operating at a signal-tonoise ratio of \u223c53. The mean gain of the full measurement chain corresponds to \u223c16.6 ADC/pixel with a RMS spread of \u223c1.0 ADC/pixel, which is about 6 %,\nacross all channels of the detector system. For channels of the same ASIC the spread in gain is only \u223c2.5 %, as illustrated in Fig. 7, demonstrating that the gain variation between ASICs contributes dominantly to the overall gain spread in contrast to the intrinsic SiPM gain variation. The presented results validate not only a stable and reliable system operation, but also an excellent gain uniformity on readout level prior to the channelwise calibration."

            "text": "Most parameters of a SiPM, like the gain, are strongly dependent on the SiPM over-voltage:\n\u2206V = Vbias \u2212 Vbreakdown(T ). (1)\nSince the breakdown voltage of a SiPM depends on the temperature (for the employed SiPMs dVbreakdown/dT \u223c 54 mV K\u22121 with a RMS spread of \u223c4 %), one should adjust the bias voltage according to temperature variations to keep the over-voltage (typically \u2206V \u2248 5 V) constant. Therefore, the front-end power boards of the active calorimeter layers offer the function to adjust the bias voltage of the SiPMs, capable of coping with temperature differences of up to \u223c40 K. Due to the excellent uniformity of the SiPM breakdown voltage, a common compensation for all SiPMs of a calorimeter layer is sufficient. According to temperature changes during a beam test period, the bias voltage is adjusted including a hysteresis for an increased stability to smaller fluctuations. The fully automated regular temperature compensation was used throughout the 2018 beam test periods. A gain stability within 1 % for all SiPMs was achieved, as illustrated by Fig. 8, which is within the precision of the gain extraction procedure."

Therefore, 576 uncharacterised SiPMs of the same batch could be operated with the same bias voltage at a time in one calorimeter layer. Based on daily in-situ LED gain calibration, a stable and\nreliable system operation was observed and an excellent uniformity on readout level has been achieved prior to channel-wise calibration. During the beam test periods in 2018, the layer-wise automated temperature compensation procedure allowed to keep the gain of all SiPMs of the calorimeter system constant within 1 %. Based on the success of this technological prototypes concept, the SiPM-on-tile technology will also be employed in part of the endcap upgrade of the CMS detector at the LHC, which will feature \u223c240000 channels with different types of SiPMs and different dimensions of scintillating tiles [8]."
