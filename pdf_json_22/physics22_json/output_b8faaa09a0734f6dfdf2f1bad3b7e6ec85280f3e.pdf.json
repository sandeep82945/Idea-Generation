[1], I developed in a recent publication [2] (denoted by I in the following) a formulation of the generalized Wick\u2019s theorem to compute overlaps between Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) wave functions expressed in different bases not connected by unitary transformations. In this paper, I apply the formalism to the common situation where one deals with two finite harmonic oscillator (HO) bases with different oscillator lengths. The present results could be of interest to carry out generator coordinate method (GCM) calculations and/or symmetry restoration [3\u20136] in fission; see [7,8] for a recent review and for a recent application. In fission one has to consider a set of HFB wave functions usually labeled in terms of the axial quadrupole moment |\u03c6(q20)\u3009 to study fission dynamics. The set of HFB states |\u03c6(q20)\u3009 span a large and rich set of nuclear shapes (from deformed ground states to configurations with a thin neck ending up finally in scission configurations) and therefore the oscillator lengths of the HO bases used have to adapt to the corresponding shape to reduce/optimize basis size. Typically, the oscillator lengths for each quadrupole moment are determined by minimizing the HFB energy, and the range of values obtained in a typical fission path can be rather large. As a consequence of the different oscillator lengths used for each q20 value, the bases used to express the corresponding HFB wave functions are not connected by unitary transformations (as a consequence of being finite dimensional). Therefore calculation of norm and Hamiltonian overlaps between the different configurations cannot be carried out with the traditional formulas [9,10] as they assume bases connected by unitary transformation, and therefore a generalization of Wick\u2019s theorem for overlaps between general HFB states is required. At this point it has to be mentioned\n*luis.robledo@uam.es\nthat the evaluation of overlaps between Slater determinants [11] is properly handled even if the bases are not connected by unitary transformation. The most straightforward solution to this problem would be to use a common basis (with the same oscillator lengths) for all the HFB states in the fission path, but this solution demands huge harmonic oscillator bases and huge computational resources. At this point the reader might also wonder if it would not be better to use n unique, large enough basis for all the relevant HFB states, as is usually done in calculations in the mesh. This alternative is, however, impractical for all kind of interactions except for those of zero range with trivial local exchange terms. In order to find a practical solution to the above problems a generalization of the method used in [9,10] was formulated in Ref. [1]. The solution to all these problems relies on the formal extension of the original bases to make them complete and therefore unitarily connected. The basis states to be added come with zero occupancy. This approach has been pursued in Refs. [12,13] for unitary transformations and in Ref. [1] for general canonical ones. Years later, the Pfaffian formula for the proper calculation of the norm overlaps, including their sign [14,15], was subsequently generalized to consider different bases [16]. The inconvenience of the formulation of Ref. [1] is that additional considerations are required to come to the final formulas. Recently, in Ref. [2], I reformulated the work of Ref. [1] to simplify the expressions for the contractions entering the Hamiltonian and other operators\u2019 overlaps. The main advantage of the new formulation is that now it becomes evident that the operator\u2019s overlap can be obtained in terms of what is usually refereed to as \u201cintrinsic quantities\u201d (i.e., quantities that can be solely computed within the given finite bases). In this paper, I apply the formalism to the above mentioned situation of HO bases with different oscillator lengths. The required overlap matrix between the two HO bases with different lengths is explicitly built as well as its lower upper (LU) decomposition that plays a central role in the final expressions of Ref. [2]. The main\n2469-9985/2022/105(4)/044317(8) 044317-1 \u00a92022 American Physical Society\napplication of the present formulation is to carry out GCM calculations or restore spatial symmetries in a fission framework. The new formulas could also be used to provide a more robust and precise formulation of the time dependent GCM. This will definitely help to improve our understanding of fission fragment properties and fission dynamics."

            "text": "Recently [2], a convenient formalism to evaluate the overlap of general multi-body operators between arbitrary HFB wave functions\n\u3008\u03c60|O\u0302|\u03c61\u3009 \u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 (1)\nwas laid down. In it, each of the HFB states entering the overlap are expanded in different bases not connected by unitary transformations (i.e., not expanding the same subspace of the whole Hilbert space). First, I establish the notation and then present the main results. The bases and associated creation operators are denoted by B0 = {c\u20200,k, k = 1, . . . , N0} in the case of |\u03c60\u3009 and B1 = {c\u20201,k, k = 1, . . . , N1} in the case of |\u03c61\u3009. Both bases satisfy canonical fermion antcommutation relations (CAR), i.e., {c\u2020i,k, ci,k\u2032 } = \u03b4kk\u2032 , and are connected by an overlap matrix {c\u20200,k, c1,l} = 0\u3008k|l\u30091 = Rkl . For simplicity, I assume in the following N0 = N1 = N , but note that the most general case can be easily accommodated in the formalism. One can also introduce the complement of the two bases B\u03040 = {c\u20200,k, k = N + 1, . . . ,\u221e} and B\u03041 = {c\u20201,k, k = N + 1, . . . ,\u221e} such that B0 \u222a B\u03040 = {c\u20200,k}\u221e and B1 \u222a B\u03041 = {c\u20201,k}\u221e expand the whole separable Hilbert space and therefore represent bases connected by a unitary (infinite dimensional) transformation matrix R (not to be confused with R). Let me also introduce the quasiparticle annihilation operators \u03b1i\u03bc (i = 0, 1), which annihilate |\u03c6i\u3009. They are written in terms of the complete bases {c\u2020i,k}\u221e through the standard definition\n\u03b1i\u03bc = \u2211\nk\n(U \u2217i )k\u03bcci,k + (V \u2217i )k\u03bcc\u2020i,k .\nThe Bogoliubov amplitudes Ui and Vi have a block structure, Vi = (\nV\u0304i 0 0 0\n) , Ui = ( U\u0304i 0 0 di ) ,\nwhere V\u0304i and U\u0304i are the N \u00d7 N matrices characterizing |\u03c6i\u3009. In this way, the set of N quasiparticle operators \u03b1i\u03bc with \u03bc = 1, . . . , N , correspond to the quasiparticle operators expanded in the truncated bases Bi. The di are arbitrary unitary matrices that play no role in the final expressions. It is also convenient to express the unitary matrix R connecting B0 \u222a B\u03040 with B1 \u222a B\u03041 as a block matrix,\nR = ( R S T U ) .\nThe matrix R is just the representation of the unitary operator T\u030201 connecting the two complete bases T\u030201c\u20200,k T\u0302 \u2020 01 = c\u20201,k whereas R is the restriction of this operator to the bases\nB0 and B1. In the present case, where one is dealing with HO bases differing in their oscillator lengths, T\u030201 is just the dilatation operator. As discussed in Appendix A, it is the exponential of a one-body operator. As shown in Ref. [2], the calculation of the overlap of Eq. (1) simplifies enormously if the operator O\u0302 is written in second quantization form in terms of both bases {c\u20200,k}\u221e and {c\u20201,k}\u221e . One-body operators are expressed in the form\nO\u0302 = \u2211\nkl\nO01kl c \u2020 0,kc1,l (2)\nwith\nO01kl = 0\u3008k|O\u0302|l\u30091. In the same way a two-body operator will be expressed as\nO\u0302 = 1 4 \u2211 k1k2l1l2 \u03c5\u030301k1k2l1l2 c \u2020 0k1 c\u20200,k2 c1,l2 c1,l1 , (3)\nwhere the antisymmetrized two body matrix element is given by \u03c5\u030301k1k2l1l2 = \u03c501k1k2l1l2 \u2212 \u03c501k1k2l2l1 , and \u03c501k1k2l2l1 = 0\u3008k1k2|\u03c5\u0302|l1l2\u30091 are the interaction\u2019s matrix elements. The extension to higher order operators is straightforward. The sums in Eqs. (2) and (3) extend over the complete bases {c\u20200,k}\u221e or {c\u20201,k}\u221e to faithfully represent the operators. As shown in I, the overlaps of those operators can be obtained by using the standard rules of Wick\u2019s theorem but using the elementary contractions\n\u03c101lk = \u3008\u03c60|c\u20200,kc1,l |\u03c61\u3009\n\u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 (4)\n= {[ V\u0304 \u22171 A \u22121V\u0304 T0 ] lk, l \u2282 B0, k \u2282 B1,\n0, otherwise,\n\u03ba\u030401k1k2 = \u3008\u03c60|c\u20200,k1 c\u20200,k2 |\u03c61\u3009\n\u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 (5)\n= {\u2212[(RT )\u22121U\u0304 \u22171 A\u22121V\u0304 T0 ]k1k2 , k1 \u2282 B0, k2 \u2282 B0,\n0, otherwise,\n\u03ba10l1l2 = \u3008\u03c60|c1,l1 c1,l2 |\u03c61\u3009\n\u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 (6)\n= {[ V\u0304 \u22171 A \u22121U\u0304 T0 (RT )\u22121 ] l1l2\n, l1 \u2282 B1, l2 \u2282 B1, 0, otherwise,\nand therefore all the indices in the sums are restricted to the subspace spanned by B0 or B1. Although not obvious from the expressions in the right-hand side of Eqs. (5) and (6) the quantities \u03ba\u030401k1k2 and \u03ba 10 l2l1\nare skew-symmetric matrices. In the above expressions, the matrix A is given by\nA = U\u0304 T0 (RT )\u22121U\u0304 \u22171 + V\u0304 T0 RV\u0304 \u22171 . (7) Using the above contractions the overlap of a one-body operator is given by\n\u3008\u03c60|O\u0302|\u03c61\u3009 \u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 = N\u2211 k,l=1 O01kl \u03c1 01 lk = Tr [ O01\u03c101 ] , (8)\n044317-2\nwhereas for a two-body matrix element one obtains\n\u3008\u03c60|O\u0302|\u03c61\u3009 \u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 = 1 4 N\u2211 k1,k2,l1,l2=1 \u03c5\u030301k1k2l1l2 [ \u03c101l1k1\u03c1 01 l2k2\n\u2212\u03c101l1k2\u03c101l2k1 + \u03ba\u030401k1k2\u03ba10l2l1 ] . (9)\nPlease remember that, contrary to the standard method, the matrices O01kl , \u03c1 01 lk , and \u03c5\u0303 01 k1k2l1l2\nare not Hermitian but the matrices \u03ba\u030401k1k2 and \u03ba 10 l1l2\nare still skew-symmetric. The overlap of the two HFB wave functions is\n\u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 = \u221a det A det R. (10)\nIn Ref. [2] a subsequent lower-upper (LU) decomposition of R was introduced,1\nR = L\u22170LT1 , (11) where L0 and L1 are both lower triangular matrices. The decomposition introduces implicitly a biorthogonal basis |k)1 =\u2211\n(LT1 ) \u22121 jk | j\u30091 and 0(l| = \u2211 0\u3008i|(L\u22170 )\u22121li such that 0(l|k)1 = \u03b4lk . The LU decomposition of the overlap matrix suggests the definitions\nU\u03030 = (L\u22170 )\u22121U\u03040L+0 , V\u03030 = L+0 V\u03040L+0 , (12)\nU\u03031 = (L\u22171 )\u22121U\u03041L+1 , V\u03031 = L+1 V\u03041L+1 (13) that turn out to be very useful to define handy quantities not depending explicitly on R, for instance,\nA\u0303 = U\u0303 T0 U\u0303 \u22171 + V\u0303 T0 V\u0303 \u22171 = L\u22170ALT1 . (14) The overlap is now written as\n\u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 = \u221a det A\u0303. (15)\nIt is also convenient to introduce the contractions \u03c1\u030301lk = [ V\u0303 \u22171 A\u0303 \u22121V\u0303 T0 ]\nlk = LT1 \u03c101L\u22170, (16) \u02dc\u0304\u03ba01k1k2 = \u2212 [ U\u0303 \u22171 A\u0303 \u22121V\u0303 T0 ] k1k2 = L+0 \u03ba\u030401L\u22170, (17)\n\u03ba\u030310l1l2 = [ V\u0303 \u22171 A\u0303 \u22121U\u0303 T0 ] l1l2 = LT1 \u03ba01L1. (18)\nUsing them and the matrix elements O\u0303 = (L\u22170 )\u22121O01(LT1 )\u22121 one gets Tr(O\u0303\u03c1\u030301) for the overlap of a one-body operator. Please note that O\u0303lk are the matrix elements of the operator O\u0302 in the biorthogonal basis 0(l| and |k)1, i.e., O\u0303lk = 0(l|O\u0302|k)1 =\u2211\ni j (L \u2217 0 )li\u221210 \u3008i|O\u0302| j\u30091(LT1 ) \u22121 jk . Similar considerations apply to the overlap of two-body operators. Introducing the two-body matrix element in the biorthogonal basis \u03c5Bi jkl = 0(i j|\u03c5\u0302|kl )1, related to \u03c501i jkl by\n\u03c5B = (L\u22170 )\u22121(L\u22170 )\u22121\u03c501 ( LT1 )\u22121( LT1 )\u22121 ,\n1According to theorem 3.5.7 of [17] any nonsingular matrix A has a LU decomposition A = PLU where P is a permutation matrix, and L (U ) lower (upper) triangular nonsingular matrices. In the present development, the permutation matrix is omitted for simplicity as it is not required, but it can be easily considered in other cases.\none can define the HF potential \u030301ik = 12 \u2211 \u03c5\u0303Bi jkl \u03c1\u0303 01 l j and pair-\ning field \u030301i j = 12 \u2211 \u03c5\u0303Bi jkl \u03ba\u0303 01 kl to write\n\u3008\u03c60|\u03c5\u0302|\u03c61\u3009 \u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 = 1 2 Tr[\u030301\u03c1\u030301] \u2212 1 2 Tr[\u030301 \u02dc\u0304\u03ba01], (19)\nwhich is again the standard expression but defined in terms of Eqs. (16)\u2013(18) and the definitions above. The advantage of the definitions in Eqs. (14), (16)\u2013(18) is that they have exactly the same expression as the formulas available in the literature for complete bases but expressed in terms of the \u201ctilde\u201d U and V matrices of Eqs. (12) and (13). There is an additional advantage in the fact that A\u0303 is a \u201cmore balanced\u201d matrix, being less affected by the near singular character of the overlap matrix R."

            "text": "To apply the above formalism to the case of HO bases with different oscillator lengths one just needs to compute the overlap matrix Rkl = 0\u3008k|l\u30091 and the overlap matrix elements O01kl = 0\u3008k|O\u0302|l\u30091 and 0\u3008k1k2|\u03c5\u0302|l1l2\u30091 for the harmonic oscillator bases with different oscillator lengths. To simplify the discussion, I will restrict to the case of a HO basis tensor product of one-dimensional (1D) states \u03d5n( r) = \u220f3 i=1 \u03d5ni (xi, bi ) with \u03d5ni (xi, bi ) = e\u22121/2x2i /b2i \u03d5\u0304ni (xi, bi ) the product of a Gaussian factor times a polynomial\n\u03d5\u0304ni (xi, bi ) = 1 /\u221a\u221a \u03c02ni ni!bi Hni (xi/bi )\nproportional to the Hermite polynomial Hn of degree n. As any polynomial of degree n can be written as a linear combination of n + 1 polynomials of degree n or less, one can express \u03d5\u0304n(x, b0) in terms of \u03d5\u0304n(x, b1) by means of a finitedimensional lower triangular transformation matrix Lnm(q01) that depends on the ratio q01 = b1/b0 (see Appendix B):\n\u03d5\u0304n(x, b0) = n\u2211\nm=0 Lnm(q01)\u03d5\u0304m(x, b1).\nDue to the lower triangular structure of the matrix L, both its inverse and determinant can be obtained analytically (see Appendix B). It is now straightforward to compute the 1D overlaps\nRnm = \u222b dx \u03d5\u2217n (x, b0)\u03d5m(x, b1)\n= \u222b dx e\u2212 x2\nB2 \u03d5\u0304\u2217n (x, b0)\u03d5\u0304m(x, b1)\n= \u2211\nr\nL\u2217nr (q0)Lmr (q1),\nwhere the new oscillator length B is given by 1/B2 = 12 ( 1/b20 + 1/b21 ) (20) and one has introduced the parameters q0 = B/b0 and q1 = B/b1. The matrices L(qi ) are the ones transforming \u03d5\u0304m(x, bi ) into \u03d5\u0304m(x, B). The full overlap matrix is then given by\nRnm = 0\u3008n|m\u30091 = (L\u2217(q0)LT (q1))nm (21)\n044317-3\nwith\nLnm(q0) = Lnxmx (q0x )Lnymy (q0y)Lnzmz (q0z ). (22) It is obvious that the matrices L(qi ) have to be identified with the Li introduced in Eq. (11). The matrix Lnm(q0) can be also arranged as a triangular matrix if one takes the standard ordering n = (nx, ny, nz ) with nx = 0, . . . , Nx, ny = 0, . . . , Ny(nx ), and nz = 0, . . . , Nz(nx, ny). With this ordering the inverse matrix L\u22121nm (q0) can also be written in analytical form in terms of the inverse of the 1D quantities given in Appendix B,\nL\u22121nm (q0) = L\u22121nxmx (q0x )L\u22121nymy (q0y)L\u22121nzmz (q0z ). (23) The determinant of R is given by the product of the determinant of two lower triangular matrices\ndet R = ( det[L(q0)])\u2217 det[L(q1)]. Given the lower triangular structure of the L(qi ) matrices, their determinant is just the product of the elements in the diagonal det[L(qi )] = \u220f\u2032 nx,ny,nz qnx+1/2ix q ny+1/2 iy q nz+1/2 iz , where the product is restricted to those values of nx, ny, and nz compatible with the definition of the basis (typically, some energy condition, \u2211 nx,ny,nz\nh\u0304\u03c9x(nx + 1/2) + h\u0304\u03c9y(ny + 1/2) + h\u0304\u03c9z(nz + 1/2) < E0). The explicit form of the LU decomposition of the 1D R immediately suggests the introduction of the biorthogonal states\n\u3008x|m)1 = e\u2212 x2 2B2 \u03d5\u0304m(x, B) = e\u2212 x2 2B2 \u2211 m\u2032 L\u22121mm\u2032 (q1)\u03d5\u0304m\u2032 (x, b1)\n(24) and\n0(n|x\u3009 = e\u2212 x2 2B2 \u03d5\u0304\u2217n (x, B) = e\u2212 x2\n2B2 \u2211\nn\u2032 L\u2217\u22121nn\u2032 (q0)\u03d5\u0304 \u2217 n\u2032 (x, b0) (25)\nsuch that 0(n|m)1 = \u03b4nm. Clearly, bras and kets of the biorthogonal states turn out to be connected by Hermitian conjugation and therefore they form a unique set of orthogonal states thanks to the special properties of the HO states. This unique set is just a set of HO wave functions with oscillator length B.\nThe matrix elements of one-body momentum-independent operators O\u0302 can be expressed in terms of the matrix elements computed with the orthogonal basis with oscillator length B = (Bx, By, Bz ) :\n0\u3008n|O\u0302|m\u30091 = (L\u2217(q0)OBLT (q1))nm. (26) Here OB is the matrix of the matrix elements of O\u0302 computed with the HO basis with lengths B. In the case of two-body momentum independent operators like the central or Coulomb potentials the generalization is again straightforward:\n0\u3008nm|\u03c5\u0302|pq\u30091 = \u2211 rstu L\u2217(q0)nrL\u2217(q0)ms\u3008rs|\u03c5\u0302|tu\u3009B (27)\nL(q1)pt L(q1)qu, (28)\nwhere \u3008rs|\u03c5\u0302|tu\u3009B are the matrix elements of the two-body potential computed with HO states with length B.\nFor the evaluation of momentum dependent operators like the kinetic energy or the spin-orbit potential the easiest way is\nto use recursion relations like \u2202\n\u2202x \u03d5\u0303n(x) = 1\u221a\n2B\n( q20 \u221a n\u03d5\u0303n\u22121(x) \u2212 q21 \u221a n + 1\u03d5\u0303n+1(x) ) (29)\nand\n\u22022\n\u2202x2 \u03d5\u0303n(x) = 1 2B2 ( q40 \u221a n(n \u2212 1)\u0303\u03d5n\u22122(x)\n\u2212 q20q21(2n + 1)\u0303\u03d5n(x) + q41 \u221a (n + 1)(n + 2)\u0303\u03d5n+2(x) ) , (30)\nwhere \u03d5\u0303n(x) = e \u2212 x2\n2b21 \u03d5\u0304n(x, B). For instance, the matrix elements of the one-body kinetic energy operator are given by\n0\u3008n|T\u0302 |m\u30091 = (L\u2217(q0)TBLT (q1))nm, where the matrix elements TB are computed in the traditional way, using HO with oscillator lengths B but using the recursion relations of Eqs. (29) and (30) instead of the traditional ones. The same recursion relations can be used in the evaluation of the matrix elements of the two-body spin-orbit potential. Note that the corresponding formulas for the two-dimensional HO wave functions often used in axially symmetric codes can be found in Appendix C.\nIn the application of the present formalism to the case where density dependent interactions like Skyrme or Gogny are used one has to use a prescription for the density dependent term [12,18\u201320]. The prescription used is the so-called overlap prescription that amounts to using the density\n\u03c1ov( r) = \u3008\u03c60|\u03c1\u0302( r)|\u03c61\u3009\u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 = N\u2211 k,l=1 \u03d5\u2217k ( r; b0)\u03d5l ( r; b1)\u03c101lk\nin the density dependent term of the interaction. As mentioned in the previous section [Eqs. (12) and (13)] it is convenient to introduce the matrices\nV\u0303i = L+(qi )V\u0304iL(qi ), (31) U\u0303i = [L\u2217(qi )]\u22121U\u0304iL(qi ), (32)\nand\nA\u0303 = U\u0303 T0 U\u0303 \u22171 + V\u0303 T0 V\u0303 \u22171 = LT (q0)AL\u2217(q1). (33) They allow one to simplify the expression of the overlap to\n\u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 = \u221a det A\u0303. (34)\nThis formula is not only simpler than the original one but allows one to avoid a common problem in typical applications: the exceedingly large or small values of det L(q) can overflow or underflow the floating point computer representation of real numbers. This problem is discussed in the following section. Using the definitions of Eqs. (31) and (32) one can also introduce the density matrix contraction of Eq. (16) to express the overlap of one-body operators in Eq. (8) as\n\u3008\u03c60|O\u0302|\u03c61\u3009 \u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 = N\u2211 k,l=1 O01kl \u03c1 01 lk = Tr[OB\u03c1\u030301], (35)\ngiven in terms of the matrix elements of the operator in the HO basis with oscillator lengths B = (Bx, By, Bz ), i.e., there\n044317-4\nis no need to consider additional formulas for matrix element overlap. The same applies to the calculation of two-body terms like the overlap of the potential energy, Eq. (9). so that one can write finally\n\u3008\u03c60|\u03c5\u0302|\u03c61\u3009 \u3008\u03c60|\u03c61\u3009 = 1 2 Tr[\u030301\u03c1\u030301] \u2212 1 2 Tr[\u030301 \u02dc\u0304\u03ba01] (36)\nwith the HF potential\n\u030301ik = 1\n2\n\u2211 \u03c5\u0303Bi jkl \u03c1\u0303 01 l j (37)\nand pairing field\n\u030301i j = 1\n2\n\u2211 \u03c5\u0303Bi jkl \u03ba\u0303 01 kl (38)\ncomputed with matrix elements of the potential in the HO basis with lengths B [except for the momentum dependent terms of the potential where, additionally, one has to use the modified recursion relations of Eqs. (29) and (30)]. For the spatial overlap density one finally obtains\n\u03c1ov( r) = N\u2211\nk,l=1 \u03d5\u2217k ( r; B)\u03d5l ( r; B)\u03c1\u030301lk .\nTo summarize this section, the calculation of overlaps of operators between HFB states expressed in HO basis with different oscillator lengths involves\n(1) Computing matrix elements of the operators with a set of HO functions with oscillator length parameters B given by Eq. (20). (2) Computing the U\u0303i and V\u0303i Bogoliubov amplitudes (31) and (32) and A\u0303 in Eq. (33). (3) Computing the density matrix and pairing tensor contractions of Eqs. (16)\u2013(18). (4) Evaluating the HF potential (37) and pairing field (38). (5) Evaluate overlaps for one-body operator (35) and two-\nbody operator (36).\nPlease note that Eqs. (33), (16)\u2013(18) have the traditional form but in terms of U\u0303i and V\u0303i Bogoliubov amplitudes (31) and (32). Therefore, the modifications required to implement the formalism described in an existing computer code are minimal and easy to implement."

            "heading": "IV. APPLICATION OF THE METHOD",
            "text": "In this section the formalism will be used to compute the overlaps between the members of the set of wave functions |\u03c6(q20)\u3009 entering the fission path of the nucleus 238Pu. Traditionally, those wave functions are computed in a HO basis with oscillator lengths tailored to the deformation q20 and obtained by minimizing the HFB energy as a function of the oscillator lengths. The results will be compared to the ones obtained by a blind application of the standard formulas. To motivate the discussion, I display in Fig. 1 the potential energy surface (PES) obtained as a function of the axial quadrupole moment q20 with the Gogny force D1M* [21,22]. In the\ncalculation I use an axial HO basis with 18 shells in the perpendicular direction and 27 shells in the z direction.\nIn Fig. 1, apart from the HFB energy plus the rotational correction [panel (a)], other relevant quantities like the particle-particle pairing energies for protons and neutrons [panel (b)] and the octupole and hexadecapole moments [panel (c)] are shown. One is dealing with a standard actinide with a deformed ground state, a fission isomer at q20 = 44 b,\n044317-5\nand two barriers (inner and outer). At q20 = 50 b, the HFB solution starts breaking reflection symmetry and a nonzero octupole moment develops.\nThe oscillator lengths b\u22a5 and bz obtained by minimizing the HFB energy for each value of the quadrupole moment q20 are depicted in Fig. 2. The abrupt changes observed at some q20 values are due to coexisting minima in the HFB energy EHFB(q20) as a function of b\u22a5 and bz. I could have chosen the oscillator lengths as to obtain a smoother curve in Fig. 2, but I have preferred to leave it that way because this is the typical outcome of an automatized procedure. As shown in Fig. 2, bz increases monotonically with q20 whereas b\u22a5 remains roughly constant in the whole interval. It is also evident that there are large variations in bz depending on the value of the quadrupole moment.\nTo illustrate the results obtained with the present formalism, I have chosen three emblematic values of q20, namely 40, 80, and 120 b, and varied the corresponding optimal oscillator lengths by \u00b10.05 fm to obtain different HFB solutions. Those solutions have roughly the same energy and other observables as the starting one, indicating that the HFB wave function is essentially the same in all the cases. However, as the oscillator\nlength parameters have slightly changed, the HFB amplitudes must be slightly different to absorb the changes in the basis parameters. As a consequence, one expects the traditional formula for the overlap (i.e., the one not taking into account that the bases are different) to give values differing from 1. On the other hand, the formalism introduced here should provide an overlap close to 1. The results obtained are summarized in Table I. They clearly show how the traditional overlap formula is wrong whereas the present formalism provide the expected results, namely overlaps very close to 1.\nTo finalize this section, consider now the overlaps \u3008\u03c6(q20)|\u03c6(q(0)20 )\u3009 with q(0)20 = 40, 60, and 80 b as a function of q20. They are plotted in logarithmic scale in Fig. 3 as a function of (q20 \u2212 q(0)20 )2, motivated by the fact that in the Gaussian overlap approximation \u3008\u03c6(q20)|\u03c6(q(0)20 )\u3009 \u2248 exp[\u2212\u03b3 (q20)(q20 \u2212 q(0)20 )2]. The exact overlaps computed with Eq. (34) are represented with a solid line whereas the wrong ones, computed with the Onishi-Yoshida formula [9], are plotted using dotted lines. There are several salient features worth mentioning. First, the overlaps given by the Onishi-Yoshida formula are almost always larger than the correct ones. The reason is that, as the oscillator lengths are adapted to the quadrupole moment, the basis is partially responsible for generating quadrupole deformation and therefore the Bogoliubov amplitudes of neighboring configurations change less than if the oscillator lengths of the basis were kept constant. The feature shows some exceptions in a limited q20 region in the q (0) 20 = 60 b case where the oscillator lengths as a function of q20 show a less smooth behavior than in the other cases. Second, the overlap decreases faster with Eq. (34) than with the Onishi-Yoshida formula except in a limited q20 range in the q (0) 20 = 60 b case. Third, in the q(0)20 = 60 b case Eq. (34) provides far more smooth results than the Onishi-Yoshida formula, indicating that Eq. (34) is able to absorb the changes is the oscillator lengths taking place in this case. Fourth, the Gaussian overlap formula seems to be rather inaccurate in the q(0)20 = 40 b and 60 b cases as the behaviors of the overlap in the given scales depart from the expected straight line. Finally, I briefly discuss the large and small values of det Li found in the calculation of the overlaps. As a typical example, consider q(0)20 = 40 b and q20 = 60 b. In this case, det L0 = 1.88 \u00d7 10186 and det L1 = 6.81 \u00d7 10\u2212208, giving det R = 1.28 \u00d7 10\u221221.\nAt q20 = 64 b, det R = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221230, but the overlap for protons is still relatively relevant with a value of 2.03 \u00d7 10\u22124. However, at q20 = 66 b, det L1 underflows the 64 bit floating point representation used in the calculations, and det R = 0 to machine accuracy. A bit further, at q20 = 68 b the determinant det L0 is the one that overflows and the computer value for det R is undefined. However, using Eqs. (14) and (15) the evaluation of the overlap proceeds smoothly and, what is more important, unattended."

Therefore, for an arbitrary state vector | \u3009, one has \u3008x|T\u0302 (a)| \u3009 = (ax). In one dimension, the operator is given by\nT\u0302 \u2032(a) = e\u03c4x\u2202x\nwith a = e\u03c4 . As it stands, the operator is not unitary as the exponent is not an anti-Hermitian operator. As can be easily checked, just adding \u03c4/2 to the exponent will do the trick. The unitary dilation operator is then given by\nT\u0302 (a) = e\u03c4 (x\u2202x+ 12 ). With this definition T\u0302 (a) f (x) = e\u03c4/2 f (e\u03c4 x). The extra factor exp(\u03c4/2) is usually absorbed by the normalization constant, as is the case for the harmonic oscillator wave function"
