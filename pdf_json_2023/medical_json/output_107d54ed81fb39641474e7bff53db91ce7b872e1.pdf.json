    "abstractText": "Background and Purpose: Following the global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and the recent spike in COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, the Malaysian government had imposed a Movement Control Order (MCO) on 16 March 2020 as a measure to curb the outbreak. Consequently, all non-essential affairs were suspended and operated fully on a work-from-home basis, when schools were temporarily closed, and citizens were urged to stay at home. Despite a high number of studies on the negative impacts of MCO to various sectors, there is a little concern noted for the potential impacts on vulnerable populations, including parents with special kids such as cerebral palsy (CP). The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate the burdens and difficulties associated with the experience of caring for children with CP during the MCO Methodology: This study was designed as qualitative research. Twenty-six participants were selected using a purposive sampling method to involve in in-depth interviews. They were the parents who joined the Cerebral Palsy Support Group in Terengganu, Malaysia. The interview responses were thematically analyzed using a content analysis method. Findings: Four main themes were revealed from the thematic analysis, namely emotional distress, worry over postponement of therapy and medical consultation, burn out due to work from home, and conditions of the CP children themselves. The findings indicated that both mothers, either working or housewife, experienced depression and deterioration in physical health and psychosocial emotions.

Journal of Nusantara Studies, 8(1), 246-269. http://dx.doi.org/10.24200/jonus.vol8iss1pp246-269\n1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Following the global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and the recent spike in COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, the Malaysian government had imposed a Movement Control Order (MCO) on 16 March 2020 as a measure to curb the outbreak. The MCO was most probably extended to several other phases to ensure the government successfully reduced the spread of the virus, flattened the curve, and finally overcame the spread of this pandemic. The MCO, for the first time held in Malaysia, imposed among others closure of the government, private, and business premises, closure of the education sector, and restriction of movement where the citizens are urged to stay at home. All jobs and activities were suspended and operated fully on a workfrom-home basis.\nThe most glaring impacts of MCO were the psychological impacts especially to people\nfrom the middle and low socioeconomic status. As the economic activities were mostly frozen due to the pandemic, the Malaysian Employers Federation warned that up to 2 million workers were at risk of being laid off, where the employers would probably take drastic cost cutting measures by freezing an overtime, reducing bonus, cutting backs in workers\u2019 income and offering retrenchment, or advising the workers to take the voluntary separation scheme (VSS) (Hoh, 2020). This prediction was proven true when a survey reported that 46.6 percent of the Malaysian private workers lost their jobs during the pandemic, and they were mainly from the agriculture, fisheries, services, industry, and construction sectors. Of the 53 percent who were still working, 94.8 percent experienced an income reduction. On top of that, 71.4 percent reported that their savings readiness duration was less than one month of their salary\nwho mostly worked in the sawmills, sales, and service sectors.\nStudies show three major psychological distresses of being unemployed and penniless.\nThe first is financial distress where people have to face financial ruin, and many begin to lose their lifetime savings. In addition, being jobless is embarrassing and mentally vulnerable, leading to uncontrolled anxiety since the future is uncertain (Ganley, 2002). The second is physical health due to medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, sleep deprivation, and coronary heart disease. The third is poor mental health with high levels of depression (Chen et al., 2012) that trigger a feeling of being a prisoner in their own homes. Studies by Goldsmith, Veum, and Darity, (1996, 1997) reported that the mental health problem is likely to be manifested in many forms including externality, low self-esteem, anxiety, somatization, and strained personal relations especially among married couples. Quarrels between husband and wife arising from the financial dwindling often leads to marital problems (Leonard, Brust, & Sapienza, 1992).\nApart from being impoverished, the MCO also revoked individual freedom of moving\nout from their house. Being forced to quarantine for a lengthy time, keeping a distance with others, and loss of usual physical and social routine were some of the psychological challenges faced by individuals during the MCO. Being cooped up in a house could bring about negative effects such as frustration and boredom (Dagnino et al., 2020), \u2018cabin fever\u2019 (Zainal, 2020), overthinking, anxiety over the situation, helplessness, being demotivated because of perpetuate depriving of the happy brain chemicals, being unproductive, and changing of sleep pattern (Brooks et al., 2020). Kamel (2020) added people with pre-existing disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, fatigue, and inferior complex may be triggered double by an overwhelming sense of helplessness that could worsen their symptoms.\nAs schools and day care centers were not operating during the MCO, parents must be\nat home with children full time, which obviously can be inherently stressful. Being consistently at the beck and call of demanding young children can increase feelings of strain, and a lifestyle centered around the full-time care of children could lead to intense pressure (Ganley, 2002; Lewis et al., 1999; Theodossiou, 1998). Meanwhile, the working-from-home parents were forced to perform two crucial tasks - attending office works and becoming a full-time teacher to substitute the conventional schooling (Gorlick, 2020). Eventually, the children became victims over parents\u2019 burnout to meet work deadlines. Concurrently, the office management expected the workers to deliver their utmost performance without considering the home\nmostly led the workers to be criticized and underestimated.\nDespite extensive published studies on the impacts of MCO due to COVID-19\npandemic on unemployment (Hashim et al., 2020), tourism and hospitality sector (Karim et al., 2020; Foo et al., 2020), small and medium enterprises (Fabeil, Pazim, & Langgat, 2020; Omar, Ishak, & Jusoh, 2020), and students and education (Sundarasen et al., 2020; Al-Kumaim et al., 2021), a little concern has been noted for the potential impacts on vulnerable populations, including parents with special kids such as those kids with cerebral palsy (CP), autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nOne particularly vulnerable group in this context may be the family with CP children.\nCerebral palsy is a permanent disorder of the development of movement and posture occurring in the developing fetal or infant brain. Apart from the physical limitations, the motor disorders of CP are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behavior, together with epilepsy (Rosenbaum et al., 2007). The children mostly experience limitations in daily care such as feeding, bathing, toileting, dressing, and mobility and face several behavioral and emotional problems such as hyperactivity, conduct problems, peer difficulties, and tantrums (Garip et al., 2017; Whittingham et al., 2011).\nStudies proved that parents with CP children often experience parental stress and show\nanxious and depressive symptoms. The children\u2019s maladaptive behavior, limitations in functional skills, and behavioral difficulties force the parents to struggle to face their fates, and they have to force themselves to be strong and stay positive (Davis et al., 2010). A systematic literature review by Guyard et al. (2011) reported seven parental impacts on having CP children namely time spent, occupational restrictions, social relationships, family relationships, psychological well-being, physical health, and financial burden. The quality time spent between husband and wife, and between parents and other siblings are often disrupted as most times are spent on taking care of the CP children. Husband and wife rarely sleep together as the CP children often experience sleep disorders (Dogbe et al., 2019), while travels and holidays become restricted due to the mobility and health issues of the CP children (Alaee et al., 2015). These happen not only to the parents but also to the whole family (Terra et al., 2011). These impacts remain similar throughout childhood and adolescence of the CP children (Reid et al., 2011). Above all, mothers often feel guilty for giving birth to CP children and carry heavier sense of blame than the other family members (Khayatzadeh et al., 2013). As a primary caregiver to the CP children, mothers also experience unbearable fatigue (Garip et al., 2017), and it would be worse on mothers of CP children with epilepsy (Terra et al., 2011).\nduring the MCO, this study attempted to explore the experiences and challenges faced by the parents living with CP children during the MCO. This study also aimed to investigate how the CP children\u2019s conditions affected the parents\u2019 psychosocial wellbeing during the MCO. Learning about their experiences and challenges may guide the welfare department, hospital social workers, and special child advocacies to assist the parents or caregivers of CP children accordingly by developing an emphatic model of care for this niche population.\n2.0 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Participants The participants were selected among the parents who joined the Cerebral Palsy Support Group in Terengganu, Malaysia. The support group was established in 2015, and recently, the group has an active membership of 150 children diagnosed with various levels of CP and different levels of severity. Since its establishment, the support group has been actively organizing various psychosocial-economic programs to help improve the quality of life of the CP children and their parents such as bimonthly physiotherapy sessions for free, outdoor activities, weekly house visits, edible garden project for low-income parents, and weekly religious circle (usrah). In contrast with the well-known child disability groups for the conditions such as Down syndrome, autisms disorder, and children with cancer, the active CP support group in Malaysia is scarce. It is always difficult to trace the family with CP children, hence making the justification of this support group be chosen as the unit of analysis of this study.\nAn explanation about the purpose of this study was made on the support group\u2019s\nWhatsApp chat group that was participated by all the parents. As the discussions over children\u2019s conditions and related matters in the chat group were always dominated by mothers, all the twenty\u2013six responses responding to the call came from the mothers. They were then asked to decide the date and time of interview, and they were informed of their right to anonymity and that could withdraw from the study at any time.

            "text": "This study was carried out with a qualitative approach that is widely used on complex and intricate human behaviors, thoughts, motivations, and emotions. Scholars have alarmed the danger on relying over a symbolically deduced and statistically aggregated fashion of quantitative form as the conc1usions may fail to fit reality, although they are statistically precise (Flick, 2009; Mahoney & Goerts, 2006). To ensure systematic and transparent procedures during data processing, the data were analyzed following the steps underlined by Ritchie, Spencer, and O\u2019Connor (2003). The first step was transcribing the interview transcripts into a written text. The transcribed interviews were then cross-checked through repeated careful listening by other researchers. The transcripts were transferred to the interviewees to validate the transcripts, to preserve research ethics, and to empower the interviewees by allowing them control of what was written.\nThe 72\u2013page transcripts were then manually themed and sub-themed. Along the thematic\nprocess, new themes and sub-themes were created, and the sub-themes deemed similar with other sub-themes were merged. Identifying the essence of each theme and determining the aspect captured by the theme were the most fundamental tasks in qualitative research, and the processes were the most tedious and laborious for this research. The next step was to validate the coding scheme by checking the coding consistency based on the researcher\u2019s understanding of the themes, with heavy references on the existing literatures. The analysis was conducted manually as the data sets were small. Theme validation was then verified by a clinical psychologist to ensure the trustworthiness of the themes. The last step was the most critical step. This step involved making sense of the themes or categories identified, making inferences, and presenting the researcher\u2019s reconstructions of meanings derived from the data, exploring the properties and dimensions of themes, identifying relationships between themes, uncovering\nanalysis to discover similarities and differences between participants.\n3.0 RESULTS The prevalence of themes in the informants\u2019 data was examined by counting the occurrence of codes across the 26 interview transcripts. Four main themes were found, namely emotional distress, worry over postponement of therapy and medical consultation, burn out due to working from home, and the conditions of the CP children (see Table 2)."

            "heading": "3.1 Emotional Distress",
            "text": "The emotional distress related to being a caregiver of CP children during the MCO was ubiquitous in this small sample. The emotional distress faced by the informants was mostly due to financial distress since majority of their spouses had lost jobs during the MCO. They also described their fear of COVID-19 over their CP children, as they were vulnerable and easy to get infected. This led to the feelings of being paranoid and over-cautious. Being confined at home with no physical interaction and no outings also became a factor leading to the emotional distress. Table 3 depicts the sub-difficulties faced by the caregivers under the theme emotional distress.\nEmotional distress Number of\nOccurrence\nLosing jobs (informant/spouse) 3 / 14 No savings 16 Feeling useless and mentally down due to financial ruin 16 Worry of being unable to provide special milk, diapers, and ryles tube for\nthe CP children\n16\nWorry of being unable to put food on table 16 Worry if the CP children would get fits and hospitalized 26 Worry if the CP children got infected by COVID-19 26 Lack of social interaction 26 Stress and mentally down 21\nLosing jobs certainly reduced the family savings, and being in a state of penniless would lead to fear, anxiety, overthinking, and being mentally down. Of ten employed informants, three of them were retrenched. Sixteen of twenty-six informants (61.5%) reported that their families faced severe financial difficulties since their husbands lost jobs due to the MCO. Before the MCO, their spouse worked in sawmills, construction sites, delivery, and plucking palm oil in plantation, and they received weekly payments. As most unessential businesses were ordered to close during the MCO to stop the spread of the virus, these families were amongst the most affected. Some informants recounted as follows:\n\u201cMy husband works at the construction site, and he receives RM110 a day, so every month he brought home around RM2,900. When MCO was announced, the construction was immediately stopped. I am not working, and we have almost no savings. With 5 mouths to feed and a special child some more, it was hard\u2026 her special milk, that worried us the most.\u201d (Informant I)\nAs a pillar of family, a husband often fell into depression as he was unable to financially support his family. He once used to be able to put good food on table, go on family vacations, and send the CP child to a proper therapy, yet suddenly he became worthless due to financial ruin. The informants shared:\nSometimes, we ended up quarrelling, but I always remind myself not to push him. For now, we stop sending our CP child to water and horse therapy regimes. We could say this is one of the hardest decisions because our child showed promising progress after joining the two crafted therapies.\u201d (Informant C)\nThe financial burden faced by the families with CP children during the MCO was heavier compared to those who did not have special children. Even though the Malaysia\u2019s Ministry of Health provided free medications for all disabled children, yet the responsibilities to provide special formula milk, diapers, and ryles tube were on the parents. The informants recounted:\nPediasure milk is RM139 per can and would finish in three weeks. My daughter depends solely on special milk. In a month, we have to reserve about RM400 for her milk, diapers, ryles tube, phlegm syrup, bed sore cream, and underpads. During this hard time, the priority is always on fulfilling her essential needs, only then we fulfil our needs. (Informant N)\nSince the saving is deteriorating, I tried cheaper formula milk, but my child got constipation, and his phlegm became thicker. We know this special milk is expensive, even some family members accused me of being choosy, but I am more willing to go hungry to buy Pediasure milk to my child. Same goes to aircondition, even though the electricity bill might be high, we are left with no choice, without air-condition, he would get bed sore, itchy, and become uneasy. (Informant Q)\nJust like other parents, all the informants were worried that their vulnerable CP children might be infected by the COVID-19 virus. Thousands of cases reported that patients got infected by nosocomial COVID-19 virus at the hospital, not in the community. The children were frequently admitted to the hospital due to fit and pneumonia; therefore, the parents became paranoid if their children were admitted during the pandemic.\nalone she has been hospitalized four times. I am really afraid, when she admitted, she is exposed to Covid\u2026who knows right? Seeing people died due to Covid on TV\u2026 I just cannot imagine that happens to Sarah. (Informant R)\nThe emotional breakdown was also caused by lack of social interaction. As the MCO disallowed movements and everyone had to be confined at home, the informants felt depressed. Cabin fever would cause conflicts even among the loved ones as they were stuck at home. Outings, window shopping, meetings relatives and friends, and chit-chatting with neighbors used to offer \u201cme time\u201d to the informants. They shared:\nI considered being in office, meeting clients, having lunch and coffee breaks with my college as ways for me to relieve my burden at home. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am not saying my CP child is a burden, no never\u2026 but I need times to for myself, times to twist my minds, my roles as mother to special child. When we are locked inside our home, I am truly stressed out, until sometimes I feel like running away, I need my close friends to talk to, I need times to be alone\u2026 seriously I can\u2019t stand facing similar routine for 24-hours. (Informant B).\nHousewives also experienced boredom due to the lockdown. Simple routines like chit-chatting with neighbors, outings in the evenings, and involving with community programs could chill the mothers and release their stress. They commented how lockdown had affected their mental health:\nAfter being locked inside the house, I realize how simple activities could boost my emotions. Before Covid came, we would spend our weekend window shopping at malls, join playgroup therapy, go to mosque, chit-chat with neighbors over recipes and flowers on veranda\u2026now everyone is distanced, video calls and WhatsApp chatting are just not similar with physical meeting.

            "text": "The informants reported their children\u2019s monthly appointments included pediatric consultation, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation. In addition, these sessions were mostly awaited by parents as meeting specialized doctors and physiotherapist would be used to further understand their children\u2019s conditions. Due to the MCO and rapid increase of the number of positive COVID-19 cases, all appointments were rescheduled. Table 4 depicts the most repetitive concerns mentioned by the informants over postponements of therapy and medical consultations.\nThe informants shared:\nMy son had his EEG test (the test to measure seizure on brain injured patient) in December, and the result was scheduled to be out in February, and we were going to meet Dr. A (for record: Dr. A is a child neurology specialist from a neighboring state, Kelantan). It was a long queue to have a session with Dr. A. I am so frustrated when the TCA was cancelled, and Dr. A cannot cross the state border. We really wanted to know the severity of seizure our son experienced. The EEG test had to be redone once the situation is normal, and I anticipate that it would take months to get the session. (Informant W).\nSimilarly, all rehabilitation sessions and occupational therapy (OT) sessions were cancelled as these sessions involved body contact and therapy equipment was shared with other patients. The informants never tolerated missing these sessions as the children would have chances to use all the therapy equipment that was not available at home.\nthe child shows some progress. Plus, the one-hour session would be fully utilized to use the standing frame. That is the equipment I always wanted to buy, to give chance for my son to stand. Due to COVID-19, so far, we have not attended therapy for about 5 months. How I wish to use the standing frame. (Informant C)\nSome of the CP children in this study attended a community-based rehabilitation school (Pusat Pemulihan Dalam Komuniti). It was a government center built in the community for free, and opened 4 days a week, four-hours a day. The center was not restricted to CP children only, and every child would receive a monthly allowance. Since the first phase of MCO in March 2020, the center was closed. The postponement of therapy at the hospital and closure of community centers had made the informants worried as the muscles and joints of the CP children needed a consistent therapy. To substitute that, they referred to YouTube videos, yet other problems arose.\nThey are fragile, and I am afraid she might hurt if I accidently pull her joints hard. (Informant P)\nApart from that, the weekly massage routine with a traditional massage therapist also had to be postponed. Half of the informants believed that the traditional massage would help ease tight muscle and stiff joints. Therefore, skipping the massage routine could affect the conditions of their CP children. They shared:\nThe roadblocks prevent us from bringing Lina to Makcik Nah. I could sense Lina is in pain, and apart from the modern medication, I just could help comforting her with gentle massage and rubbing essential oil (Informant F)\nThe hospitals postponed elective surgeries to help ensure that their resources were available for severely ill patients. The informants mentioned that their children\u2019s operations were rescheduled. Even though those operations were not an emergency, delaying them might worsen the conditions of the CP children. They narrated:\ndon\u2019t know whether he is in pain or otherwise. To get to see a dental specialist took months, and waiting time for a dental surgery took about a year. How frustrated when we were informed that the surgery was postponed until the COVID-19 situation is getting better. (Informant A)"

This was due to prolonged lockdown and unfriendly environment that did not correspond with their regular routine. Table 5 depicts the challenges faced by the informants in handling their CP children during the MCO.\nThe informants shared that their CP children\u2019s tantrums caused severe pressure not only to the mothers but also to all family members:\nYou can see an obvious \u2018hole\u2019 in his forehead for frequently banging his head against the wall. He wanted to go out because of his daily routine sightseeing by car. He couldn\u2019t understand that we are restricted to go out.

Table 6 shows that the informants faced four main challenges over working from home.\nThis challenge gave severe burn out to the informants to balance work demands, house chores, and taking care of children that were also busy with piles of schoolwork.\nWorking from home for me is one hand on the ladle and the other on the phone. (Informant A)\nI just cannot divide myself into three roles at the same. Boss expects me to attend office works promptly, kids are calling to help their schoolwork, food must be ready on table, never ending house chores, plus the special child, husband is also busy working from home. It is so stressful; I just cannot be 3 in 1 at the same time\u2026 it burdens me badly. (Informant B).\nThe informants were also drowned into the feeling of guilty for being unable to give a full concentration to their CP children. As working mothers, the informants described that work demands were almost unbearable, and they were in dilemma of becoming a committed worker and a responsible mother.\nphone and laptop at home. Data and consignment must be given impromptu. For many months, we just ordered food from Food Panda. I really feel guilty for my husband, guilty for my children, the feeling is heavier to Along (the CP child), I failed to give my 100% concentration to him, always skipped his exercises. Work demands were too high, husband offered to lend his hands but that was just getting worst\u2026 (Informant E)\nOn the other side of story, some of the working informants described their working performance reduced after working at home.\nMy daughter has spastic CP. We give her milk using a 3ml syringe, and to finish a bottle of milk would take about an hour. To finish a small bowl of porridge would take another hour. She drinks milk 5 to 6 times a day, eats porridge 3 times a day. How could I focus on work? Some in my teams were considerate, but some just did not understand. When she sleeps, I had to attend house chores, cooking, cleaning, 24 hours were just not enough\u2026 Thinking of quitting but my position is stable, it is a permanent position. (Informant C)\nWhile working at home, the informants had to attend the normal children as well. As schools and kindergartens were all closed, everyone was at home, and everyone was locked inside the house. The house became a new playing field, mess and noisy. The CP children usually cannot bear noise as they were very sensitive to sounds due to Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD).\nNoise always caused jerking to my son. He is used to a quite environment since during the daytime, his siblings will be busy schooling and attending extra classes, and at night, they will be busy with homework and watching TV. Now everyone is not going to school, and everyone is bored at home, they fight, the argue, they jump, these really bother my CP child. I ended up screaming, asking them to keep quiet, but it is very exhausting. (Informant G).\n4.0 DISCUSSION This study found significant findings on the challenges faced by the mothers taking care of CP children during the period of MCO. Half of the informants\u2019 spouses lost their jobs during the\nvulnerable B40 before the pandemic, the MCO had changed their economic status to a pandemic poor. Losing jobs, as described by Chen et al. (2012), Ganley (2002), and Goldsmith et al. (1996, 1997), would cause financial distress that leads to the feelings of anxiety, worthlessness, uncertainty, and overthinking. To make the matters worse, it would also trigger conflicts between spouses and suicide attempts. In this tight situation, domestic violence, divorce, and child abuse are rampant (Brooks et al., 2020; Khaiyom, 2020). Statistics proved that between January and April 2021 alone, 902 domestic violence cases were reported (Ariffin, 2021), 6,569 divorce cases were filed between May and June 2020 (Ismail, 2020), and child abuse cases increased 20 percent in the year 2020 (Yunus, 2021). The informants admitted that sometimes they could not control their emotions by ignoring or hitting their CP children, and then felt guilty for their poor parenting. This occurred when they were physically exhausted and were emotionally and financially unstable, in addition to noises and messes created by the normal children, and the CP children demanded attention.\nThe informants revealed that with the presence of a CP child in a family, the financial\npressure was more intense. The expense of rising CP children was high, and the parents\u2019 inability to provide special milk, medications, and comfort would affect the well-being of the CP children such as milk intolerance, underweight, constipation, and overstimulation (Whittingham et al., 2011). The fathers often felt guilty for being unable to provide better conditions to the CP children, and they channeled their frustrations either to the spouse or to the other children. Although each eligible CP child in Malaysia received RM200 monthly welfare allowance and should be enough to cover their daily expenses, the money was used to cover the family expenses during the pandemic. The government also offered one-off cash aids and food baskets to these vulnerable families together with the economic relief package and moratorium to reduce their financial burden (PMO, 2020). Yet, relying on the government aids was not a solution to make ends meet, and the informants\u2019 needed jobs. Prolonged MCO, uncertain regulations on essential economic sectors, and skyrocketing COVID-19 cases had dimmed employment opportunities.\nStuck with similar routines with no space for mothers\u2019 private time had decreased the\ninformants\u2019 level of happiness. Socially, Malaysians looked for any excuse to throw foodfueled social gatherings as these social activities had become great stress relievers. The cabin fever threat became worse when all the children were staying together since schools were closed and the informants had an additional task, which was to supervise their children\u2019s homebased schooling. The new routines demanded extra energy and time, and this had slashed out\nhad a difficult time juggling between work, childcare, and chores during the MCO (Clark et al., 2021). The informants complained that they started experiencing physical health disturbances like headaches, backaches, sleep disturbances, weight gain, and hair fall. Upset by the Prime Minister\u2019s remarks that work-from-home mothers had more time at home and they could try all sorts of new recipes to cook for the family, the Director of the Center for Research on Women and Gender, Universiti Sains Malaysia revealed that the MCO actually required extra energy from the working mothers to continue fulfilling their job obligations while concurrently playing the primary caregiving roles (Endut, 2020).\nThe office management demanded the staff to attend to work promptly with less\nconsideration on the situation faced by the work-from-home mothers. Navigating office works, normal children, the CP children, and house affairs drained the informants\u2019 energy. Feeding alone would take time as the CP children had feeding disorders and swallowing problems. Each feeding session approximately took about one hour, six times a day. This left them feeling not working hard enough when they attended the CP children and delayed the office works. Similarly, they felt guilty skipping the mealtime of the CP children and ignoring them especially when the office works were piling up. Concurrently, the teammates chose not to consider their situations and indirectly criticized their decreased performance on office\u2019s WhatsApp group. Yet, the informant shared that resigning from work was not an option since their position was permanent, and they needed to be financially independent. The informants were aware that taking care of CP children was costly, and there were cases that husbands abandoned the family because of the CP children (Dogbe et al., 2019; Park & Nam, 2019).\nDuring the MCO period, the CP children had to adjust to new routines since\nrehabilitation school was closed, pediatric appointments and weekly therapy sessions were postponed, and elective surgeries were rescheduled. The CP children were prone to pneumonia; therefore, bringing them to the hospital for appointments might expose them to nosocomial COVID-19 (infection was acquired in the hospital, not in the community) that might lead to death as well. The informants understood the wisdom behind these postponements because they themselves were still traumatized by the incident while they were giving birth to their CP children. Even though the CP children were cognitively weak, they could feel the difference in their established routines. Eventually, the disruptions in the routines had negatively affected their general health, mobility, spasticity, joint motion, communication, and their mood (Cankurtaran et al., 2021; Dhiman et al., 2020). The informants took their own initiatives to learn basic therapies from the YouTube videos and tried essential oils to reduce joint pain and\nand changing environment had caused aggression, impulsiveness, and self-harm. Calming them was adventurous because the CP children could not understand any forms of persuasive communications. The informants agreed that sometimes their endurance had reached the limit.\nThe challenges faced by the caregivers of CP children during the MCO must be tackled\nas financial and social resources and emotional security could help ease those challenges and help improve their quality of life. The MCO period witnessed numerous non-governmental organizations (NGOs) went to the ground to offer financial, food, and mobility supports to the vulnerable families with special children (UNICEF, 2020). They also substituted the cases that might be overlooked by the Welfare Department by initiating \u2018The White Flag Campaign\u2019 as a symbol of hope and helping each other (Rahman, 2021). The existence of CP support group offered relief to the mothers\u2019 emotional loneliness and fatigue since they regarded the support group as an avenue for them to share stories about the CP children and the mothers\u2019 emotions since they were in the same shoes. The support group also held weekly online therapies conducted by certified physiotherapists where mothers could directly ask questions about the joint pain and spasticity of their CP children, and the therapist would demonstrate the basic steps to do the therapies to the parents.\n5.0 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS The purpose of this study was to explore the challenges faced by the caretakers of CP children during the MCO due to COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the mothers, either working or housewife, indicated four main challenges namely emotional distress due to financial distress and psychological pressure, postponed therapy and medical consultations, challenges over working from home, and challenges over CP children\u2019s conditions. According to our findings, these challenges were simply unbearable and had negatively affected the mothers\u2019 psychosocial and physical conditions.\nSince mothers are the pillar of strength to the CP children, this study suggests financial\ninterventions, social conveniences, and spiritual assistance for them. Undeniably, government financial aids, continuous food baskets by NGOs, and emotional supports by the CP advocacy group were helpful, yet more comprehensive interventions and integrated support to the parents are critical in promoting both the children\u2019s and the parents\u2019 health and well-being.\nTherefore, it is recommended that further studies be conducted to explore parental\nstrategies for confronting these social, financial, emotional, and health challenges. Furthermore, future studies could focus on how interventions help ease their challenges in\nreligious belief and spirituality buffer the impacts of MCO on the parents with special children."
