            "text": "Each year, natural hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, avalanches, tsunamis, floods, wildfires, severe storms, and drought, globally affect humans through deaths, suffering, and economic losses. According to the insurance broker Aon, 2010\u20132019 was the worst decade on record for economic losses due to disasters triggered by natural hazards, amounting to $3 trillion: a $ trillion more than the 2000\u20132009 decade. In 2019, economic losses from disasters caused by natural hazards were estimated to be over $200 billion (UNDRR Annual Report, 2019). In this context, remote sensing demonstrates a high potential to provide valuable information, at various spatial and temporal scales, concerning natural processes and their associated risks. Recent advances in remote sensing technologies and analysis, in terms of sensors, platforms, and techniques, have strongly contributed to the development of natural hazards research. In this Special Issue titled \u201cRemote Sensing for Natural Hazards Assessment and Control\u201d, we propose state-of-the-art research that specifically addresses multiple aspects of the use of remote sensing (RS) for natural hazards (NH). The aim was to collect innovative methodologies, expertise, and capabilities to detect, assess monitor, and model natural hazards. The present Special Issue of the Remote Sensing journal encompasses 18 open-access papers that present scientific studies based on the exploitation of a broad range of RS data and techniques, as well as a well-assorted sample of NH types (Figure 1).

            "text": "The 18 papers published in the current Special Issue belong to the section \u201cEnvironmental Remote Sensing\u201d and cover a wide range of applications in terms of the RS data exploited, processing techniques used, and NH addressed.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1048 4 of 7\nChen et al. [1] applied multi-source remote sensing (InSAR from ALOS PALSAR-1 and -2) and field investigation to study the activity and kinematics of two adjacent landslides along the Datong River in the Qilian Mountains of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (China). Wang et al. [2] proposed a data partition strategy to solve typical limitations due to traditional multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) methods which require a large computer memory and time when processing full-resolution data. They validated such a strategy in Changzhou City and in Chongqing City (China). Ma et al. [3] adopted a new open-source tool named MAT.TRIGRS(V1.0) to establish the landslide susceptibility map in landslide abundance areas and to back-analyze the response of the rainfall process to the change in landslide stability. The prediction results were roughly consistent with the actual landslide distributions in Longchuan County (China). Wang et al. [4] proposed a wide-area InSAR variable-scale deformation detection strategy that combined stacking technology for fast ground-deformation rate calculations and advanced TS\u2013InSAR technology to obtain a fine deformation time series. This new strategy was tested in the Turpan\u2013Hami basin (China). Xiong et al. [5] presented a new strategy based on the Multitemporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) method to overcome limitations due to an inaccurate settlement prediction using traditional methods. The Xiamen Xiang\u2019an International Airport (China) was chosen as the test site. Wangcai et al. [6] assessed landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk in Yan\u2019an City (China) using a random forest machine learning classifier and eight environmental factors influencing landslides. Additionally, Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) was used for a hazard assessment. Hermle et al. [7], with the aim of reducing noise from decorrelation in ground motion detection by imaging, applied, for the first time, the optical flow-time series for fast landslides. The debris flows from the Sattelkar area (Austria) was selected as a benchmark site. Li et al. [8], in order to obtain a precise casualty prediction method that could be applied globally, a spatial division method based on regional differences and a zoning casualty prediction method based on support vector regression (SVR) were proposed in their paper. A selection of 30 historical earthquakes that occurred in China\u2019s mainland was chosen. Seydi et al. [9] presented a novel framework for burned area mapping based on the deep Siamese morphological neural network (DSMNN-Net) and heterogeneous datasets. Two case study areas in Australian forests were selected. Nolde et al. [10] exploited the possibilities of a recent EO dataset published by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) by exemplarily analyzing fire severity trends on the Australian East coast for the past 20 years. Kos et al. [11] used SAR offset tracking to reconstruct a unique record of ice surface velocities for a 3.2-year period for the Palcaraju glacier located above Laguna Palcacocha, Cordillera Blanca (Peru). Ding et al. [12] carried out a review of the literature related to the application of RS and GIS in the study of flash floods. They analyzed more than 200 articles published in the last 20 years, performing keyword co-occurrence, time zone chart, keyword burst, and the literature co-citation analysis. Cheng et al. [13] presented a detailed analysis to investigate the disaster conditions of the Brumadinho dam failure (Brasil) using satellite images. Their in-depth analysis revealed a hazard chain containing three stages, namely dam failure, mud-, and hyperconcentrated flow. Pacheco et al. [14] used RS to detect, map, and monitor areas that were affected by forest fires in central Portugal. For this purpose, the study analyzed the performance of the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and random forest (RF) classifiers.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1048 5 of 7\nRanjgar et al. [15] assessed land subsidence susceptibility for Shahryar County (Iran) using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) machine learning algorithm. Additionally, they assessed if ensembles of ANFIS with two meta-heuristic algorithms could yield a better prediction performance. Wang et al. [16] proposed a new approach using the relief\u2013slope angle relationship to identify rockfall source areas controlled by rock mass strength. By using data from helicopter-based RS imagery, a 10m-DEM, and fieldwork, historical rockfalls in the Wolong study area of Tibet (China) were identified. Yang et al. [17] developed a rapid and innovative approach to estimate post-fire hillslope erosion using weather radar, RS, Google Earth Engine (GEE), GIS, and the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). They assessed the Sydney drinking water catchment area and the Warragamba Dam (Australia). Lastly, Piersanti et al. [18] presented the first evidence, via observation and modeling, of changes in magnetospheric field line resonance (FLR) eigenfrequency, which was associated with the earthquake occurrence, and demonstrated a causal connection between seismic phenomena and space-based observables. The Editors expect that these studies will lead to fruitful discussions and scientific progress, which should ultimately help to improve the overall quality and reliability of remote sensing as a now indispensable tool for approaching natural hazards."

In these Issues, several applications are offered, ranging from GIS-based hazard assessment to the use of multi-sensor data for hazard detection and mapping. Even in these examples, a wide range of natural hazards is covered, including wildfires, earthquakes, landslides, and floods.\nAuthor Contributions: The authors contributed equally to this work. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nAcknowledgments: The Guest Editors would like to acknowledge all the authors for contributing to this Special Issue and all the involved reviewers for their thoughtful comments and efforts toward improving the submitted manuscripts. Sincere gratitude goes to the Editorial Board and Office of Remote Sensing.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1048 7 of 7"
