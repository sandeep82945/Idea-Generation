Previous studies have shown that these measures distinguish neural processing in children with typical language development (TD) from those with disorders and monolingual from bilingual children. In this study, bilingual children with Turkish as L1 and German as L2 were compared with monolingual German-speaking children with developmental language disorder (DLD) and monolingual German-speaking children with TD in order to disentangle effects of limited language input vs. reduced perceptual abilities in the processing of speech and non-speech stimuli. Sensory processing reflected by the T-complex (or from lateral temporal electrode sites) was compared in response to a German vowel and a sine-wave tone in the three groups of children, ages 5 through 6 years. Stimuli were presented while children watched a muted video. Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were time-locked to the vowels and tones. AEPs to the frequent (standard) stimuli within an oddball paradigm were analyzed at the left (T7) and right (T8) temporal electrode sites. The results revealed language status (monolingual, bilingual, and DLD), stimulus (vowel and tone), and language test measures (receptive and expressive) all influenced the T-complex amplitudes. Particularly, the peak amplitude of Ta was modulated by language status and stimulus type. Bilingual children had significantly more negative Ta responses than the monolingual children with TD for both vowels and tones while DLD children differed from TD children only for the vowel stimulus.

            "text": "It has been well-documented in the literature that children are born with the ability to distinguish and categorize most speech sounds from any of the world\u2019s languages. Within the first year of life, this ability narrows as the infant becomes attuned to the sound patterns of the ambient language(s) (e.g., Kuhl et al., 1992, 2008; Cheour et al., 1998). Neurobiological studies of speech and language have begun to reveal how intrinsic and environmental factors modulate the development of the child\u2019s phonological system (e.g., Kuhl, 2010; Shafer et al., 2011b; Yu et al., 2019).\nBoth, bilingual development as well as disordered or delayed language development are two such cases that modulate the development of the phonological system. Hence, this study is concerned with investigating and comparing the phonological processing of three groups of children (monolingual, bilingual, and with language disorder) using a neural measure suited to analyzing the processing of fine-grained auditory detail (Tcomplex). Also, this study investigates a lesser-studied bilingual group of children, namely Turkish-German children living in Germany. For these children, Turkish is the L1 and German is the L2."

            "text": "Evidence suggests that experience with a second language early in life (under 5 years of age) allows for native or native-like discrimination and categorization of speech sounds from both languages (Flege et al., 1997; Bosch and Sebasti\u00e1n-Gall\u00e9s, 2003; Hisagi et al., 2015). However, few studies have closely examined the development of L2 speech perception in the years before school entry. The studies that have addressed this question suggest that L2 speech perception and processing differ from monolingual children even after 2 years of exposure to the L2 (e.g., in daycare settings as in Rinker et al., 2010). In addition, considerable variability is observed for L2 phonological development in the years before school entry with variability evident as late as 4\u20136 years of age. A variety of factors, such as the input situation, language similarity, and the age of first exposure may account for variability in the time course of L2 phonological development, in addition to factors such as transfer or delay (Goldstein and McLeod, 2012; Core and Scarpelli, 2015).\nTo date, few studies of phonological development have focused on L2-learning of German by Turkish children (e.g., \u00dcnsal and Fox, 2002; Albrecht, 2017; Fox-Boyer et al., 2020) although Turkish-German children constitute the largest bilingual group in Germany. Many studies of bilingual phonological development have focused on English as the L2,\nand/or on Spanish L2 learners (e.g., Spanish-English children: Fabiano-Smith and Goldstein, 2010; Shafer et al., 2011a, 2015; Yu et al., 2019; Spanish-German children: Kehoe, 2002).\nThe studies of Turkish-German learners by Albrecht and colleagues examined the development of phoneme productions longitudinally with the aim of analyzing typical and atypical processes in bilingual Turkish-German children raised in Germany (Albrecht, 2017; Fox-Boyer et al., 2020). They reported that the amount of input in the German language influenced the accuracy of German phoneme productions. For Turkish phoneme productions, the results were less clear, possibly because there was considerable variability in the amount of Turkish vs. German input at home. Clearly, additional studies are needed to further understand the relationship between language input and phonological development in this population."

            "text": "The establishment of the phonological system is one of the essential bases for further language learning. Children identified as language impaired, i.e., having specific language impairment (SLI) or more recently called Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) often exhibit poor phonological development and skills, as well as poor word-learning and grammatical skills. For the remainder of the article, we will use the term DLD (Bishop et al., 2017). Poor phonological skills are seen as lower performance on speech discrimination and identification tasks (Sussman, 1993; Shafer et al., 2005; Datta et al., 2010) and phonological memory tasks (Briscoe et al., 2010; Claessen and Leitao, 2012). Children who show deviant patterns of processing speech in the first few months of life exhibit an increased risk for later language deficits (e.g., Friedrich et al., 2004; Weber et al., 2005; Cantiani et al., 2019).\nSome researchers have claimed that deviant patterns of speech processing in children with DLDmay be related to poor auditory processing skills (Tallal and Piercy, 1973; Tallal et al., 1993; Benasich and Tallal, 2002). Early disturbances in auditory and/or phonological processing appear to have persistent consequences for language development, particularly for reading. A significant proportion of children with DLD are diagnosed with dyslexia at school age (Catts et al., 2005; Boada and Pennington, 2006; Pennington and Bishop, 2009; Rispen and Baker, 2012). Even so, mixed findings have led to continued controversy about the relationship between DLD and auditory processing skills (Bishop et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2013). Clearly, more research is needed to fully understand how speech and non-speech auditory skills\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 2 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 706926\ncontribute to DLD (Tallal et al., 1993; Bishop and McArthur, 2004)."

However, most studies of children with DLD and/or bilingual input have focused on speech discrimination (e.g., Cheour et al., 2002; Peltola et al., 2005; Rinker et al., 2010; Shafer et al., 2011b; Yu et al., 2019; DLD: Shafer et al., 2005; Datta et al., 2010; Kujala and Leminen, 2017).

            "text": "AEPs reflect mainly cortical-level brain activity that is time-locked and phase-locked to an auditory stimulus. The T-complex AEPs are recorded from electrodes overlying the lateral-temporal cortex and reflect obligatory sensory processing. T-complex measures in response to auditory stimuli, including speech and non-speech, have been shown to be sensitive to language abilities (Tonnquist-Uhl\u00e9n, 1996; Shafer et al., 2011a) and language experience (Wagner et al., 2013; Rinker et al., 2017).\nThe T-complex measures were first examined in healthy adults by Wolpaw and Penry (1975). AEP responses from the temporal sites T3 and T4 (T7 and T8, respectively in the newer 10\u201310 notation) were initially elicited to a series of clicks in a time-window between 75 ms and 225 ms. These peaks were labeled Ta, a positive peak between 105 ms and 115 ms, and Tb, a negative peak between 150 ms and 160 ms. An earlier Na peak between 50 and 100 ms in adults, which might at least partially reflect the inversion of P1 at fronto-central sites, can also be observed at temporal sites (and was notmeasured inWolpaw and Penry, 1975).\nDipole modeling indicates that neural generators of the T-complex can be traced to bilateral radial dipoles in the temporal lobe; this source orientation is consistent with secondary auditory cortex activity (e.g., Ponton et al., 2002).\nA range of more recent studies extended the use of clicks to e.g., tones or speech. It was found that the Ta to tones and syllables was more prominent over the right than the left hemisphere both in younger children and teens, with syllables being even more prominent (Bishop et al., 2012) and a similar orientation towards the right for a range of speech stimuli (Shafer et al., 2011a). Only one study found that Na and Tb were more prominent on the left side (Mahajan and McArthur, 2013).\nIn summary, measures of auditory processes obtained from sites over the lateral cortex show promise for furthering our understanding of language development. However, to date, too few studies have been undertaken in children (or adults) to have a full understanding of the processes indexed by these measures\nand these studies have examined only a few different stimulus types (tones or speech)."

Specifically, Shafer et al. (2015) revealed in a developmental study from 3 months to 7 years of age that only Na is consistently present to a vowel stimulus in children under 4 years of age. The Ta and Tb peaks were clearly distinct from the child\u2019s P100 response recorded at the vertex (Cz). The Ta peak emerges between 4 and 8 years of age. Tb was not easily identified in the children\u2019s data, but it was found in adult data (Shafer et al., 2015). Studies of T-complex maturation across gradeschool and into adulthood suggest that the Ta-peak amplitude first increases from approximately 7\u201311 years of age, and then decreases in amplitude up to adulthood (Albrecht et al., 2000; Tonnquist-Uhl\u00e9n et al., 2003; Dunn and Bates, 2005; Mahajan and McArthur, 2013). The longitudinal study by Bishop et al. (2011) indicated stability in the T-complex measures from 9 to 11 years of age.\nThese findings, taken together, suggest that the generators underlying the Ta and Tb peak are highly immature before 4 years of age. Additionally, the generators may have a different orientation in infants and toddlers, leading to the absence of the peaks at the left (T7) and right (T8) temporal sites. The Na peak may partially reflect the opposite pole of the frontocentral P1 (P100; Shafer et al., 2015). P100 is the most prominent peak in young children\u2019s AEP data, and thus, the inversion of the P100 peak, seen as a negativity at inferior sites, may partially overlap with other activity recorded at temporal sites that co-occurs in the same time frame (Shafer et al., 2015)."

In the Turkish and Spanish languages, the German phoneme /\u03b5/ and English phoneme /\u03b5/ are perceived as a variant (allophone) of the Turkish /e/ and Spanish /e/, respectively. For native speakers of Turkish and Spanish, however, non-native German and English /\u03b5/ will diverge from the prototypical phonetics of Turkish /e/ and Spanish /e/. The results revealed differences between the bilingual and the monolingual groups. Neural responses measured at the temporal sites were modulated by language experience, particularly in the Ta-range. Overall, Ta peaks were less well-formed and less positive in amplitude in many of the bilingual children. The authors suggested that more limited\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 3 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 706926\nexposure to the L2 phonology resulted in less mature T-complex patterns (Rinker et al., 2017)."

Another study observed delays in the Tb latency in children with autism (Bruneau et al., 1999).\nOnly a small number of studies have examined the T-complex in children with DLD. Each of these studies observed differences in T-complex measures between children with DLD and TD. One study examined the general morphology of the waveform at temporal sites in the latency range from Na to Tb (Bishop et al., 2007). In another study, Ta amplitude was specifically observed to be attenuated in children with DLD (Shafer et al., 2011a). In this report, a variety of linguistic stimuli were investigated: vowels, real words, nonsense words, and the function word \u2018\u2018the\u2019\u2019. Specifically, children with DLD exhibited attenuated neural responses to a 250-ms vowel /\u03b5/ at the right temporal site (T8). A third study showed a similar attenuation of Ta: Bishop et al. (2012) observed differences between children with TD and DLD for the Ta-peak at site T8 to a speech syllable (\u2018\u2018bah\u2019\u2019). In addition, they tested non-verbal stimuli (a 1,000-Hz tone). Results showed a significantly reduced Ta on the right (T8) for children with DLD compared to TD.

            "text": "It currently is unclear whether T-complex measures index acoustic-level processing abilities or linguistic-level processing or a combination of both. If the T-complex, in part, reflects language-specific experience, then differences should be observed for L2 learners of a language who have not yet fully acquired the L2 phonological categories (e.g., Rinker et al., 2010). In this case, L2 experience should have little or no effect on processing non-speech tones (except in relation to lexical tone processing). The alternative is that T-complex reflects auditory maturation more generally. In this case, differences\nbetween bilingual and monolingual children would originate from exposure to acoustic stimuli within the environment.\nThe finding that children with DLD show an attenuated T-complex to both speech and tones suggests poor auditory processing (e.g., Shafer et al., 2011a; Bishop et al., 2012). Children learning an L2, who do not have DLD, should not have poor auditory processing. Thus, if T-complex reflects general auditory processing skills, then bilingual andmonolingual children should show no difference in T-complex measures for non-speech auditory information."

(2017) can be attributed to experience with the German vowel or to a more general modulation of auditory processing. To do this, we examined T-complex to both speech (German vowel /\u03b5/) and non-speech (600-Hz tone). Also, we added children with DLD; this allowed us to further address whether differences in the T-complex observed for these children are related to general auditory processing or to a speech-related deficit. Testing all three groups and the two stimulus types facilitates our efforts to disentangle the effects of limited language input vs. purported perceptual abilities in the processing of verbal (German /\u03b5/) and non-verbal stimuli. Differences between monolingual children and bilingual children can be attributed to limited input in the L2 (= effect of language experience). Bilingual childrenmay show differences compared to monolingual learners because at the time of testing they had received less exposure to the L2.\nWe hypothesize that T-complex measures to both speech and non-speech are delayed or reduced for children with DLD (Shafer et al., 2011a; Bishop et al., 2012). We also predict that there is a correlation between children\u2019s language skills, particularly phonological memory, and neural responses. For the bilingual children, we predict that the T-complex to non-speech stimuli will not differ from the monolingual TD children, as the processing may not be dependent on language experience. These bilingual children are the same as those in Rinker et al. (2017), and thus, we have already reported that their responses to the L2 German vowel were attenuated compared to the monolingual German group."

Children with DLD underwent additional audiological testing which is reported in a separate article (Rinker et al., 2014). As detailed in Table 1, groups did not differ significantly regarding age or IQ. Receptive and expressive German language skills were measured by the respective subtests of a Germanlanguage development test (Grimm and Sch\u00f6ler, 1991). In this standardized language development test, children have to repeat sentences with increasing complexity (expressive skills) or re-enact a sentence using wooden toys (receptive skills). In a passive lexical test of Turkish (part one of CITO, Arnheim, NL) Turkish\u2013German children scored 39 out of 60 points (\u2018\u2018satisfactory\u2019\u2019; see Table 1). This test is computer-based and children have to click on the correct picture out of four pictures displayed.\nThe three groups differed significantly on various language measures (see Table 1). Both bilingual children and children with DLD differed from the TD monolingual children in their receptive and expressive language measures (between 1.5 SD and 2 SD below the mean on at least the expressive or the receptive test). However, only DLD and TD children differed in their non-word repetition skills.\nA language and developmental questionnaire (available from the authors upon request) was administered to all groups. The mean age of acquisition of German for the Turkish-German children was 28.8 months (SD 11.6) but the current language input was quite mixed with children being exposed to a primarily German environment for part of the day and to a mixed TurkishGerman environment at home. Further language background data for the bilingual population can be found in Rinker et al. (2017). The monolingual German children (TD and DLD) were not exposed to a second language at home."

The duration of the stimulus was 250 ms. A 5-ms rise and fall time was applied at the beginning and the end of the stimulus waveform using Hanning-windowing. Amplitude was maintained at the same level (fluctuating by less than 1.2 dB) for the remainder of the stimulus. The fundamental frequency was 115 Hz and F1 and F2 were 370 Hz and 1,965 Hz, respectively. The sounds were presented through headphones at 90 dB SPL. The ISI was 650 ms. We used an oddball design which elicits both the T-complex and themismatch negativity (MMN). A total of 595 stimuli were presented. The non-speech stimulus was a 600-Hz tone with a 150-ms duration with 5-ms rise and fall time. The sound intensity, ISI, and number of stimuli were the same as in the speech stimuli.\nAs this was an oddball design to elicit the mismatch negativity (MMN), both, the standard stimuli /\u03b5/ and the 600 Hz tone occurred with a probability of 0.85 and deviant /e/ with a probability of 0.15.

In contrast, for the tone condition, only the bilingual children showed a less positive Ta compared to the monolingual TD group. The children with DLD seemed to have a somewhat intermediate Ta response to the tones since their response did not differ from either the TD monolingual or the bilingual group. With respect\nto the latency measures, there were group effects at both Na and Tb, but only for the vowel condition. For Na, the bilingual group had longer latencies, while the monolingual groups (TD and DLD) did not differ. With respect to Tb, the DLD and the bilingual group did not differ and, in fact, the bilingual and DLD groups had shorter Tb latencies than the monolingual TD group.\nWe also observed effects of the hemisphere and of stimulus that did not interact with the group. The Na was generally more negative for vowels than for tones. The hemisphere effect was also significant in the mixed modeling approach used to examine three-way interactions between hemisphere, group, and stimulus. The children generally showed more negative amplitudes at the left than at the right sites for both tones and vowels, consistent with reports from previous studies (Shafer et al., 2011a, 2015; Bishop et al., 2012).\nThe Na and Ta peak amplitudes and latency measures were only weakly associated with some of the language measures. The left Ta latency was weakly correlated with expressive language skills (EG and NWR) and the right Na amplitude was negatively correlated with receptive language skills. However, after correcting for multiple tests, these relationships were not significant. Below, we discuss this pattern of findings in greater detail."

This hypothesis led to the prediction that bilingual children would show an attenuated T-complex response to vowels, but not to tones. This hypothesis does not lead to a clear prediction for the monolingual children with DLD because they receive considerable input in their native language; however, it is possible that this input is less complex (to adjust to the child\u2019s language level) and that the slower rate of learning (leading to a smaller vocabulary) is equivalent to less experience with the first language phonology.

In contrast, only the bilingual group showed a difference from the monolingual controls for the tone stimuli, but primarily in latency measures. As stated above, this pattern of findings only partially supports our hypothesis that language experience modulates the T-complex. Specifically,\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 9 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 706926\nthe bilingual group should have shown comparable T-complex responses to the monolingual TD group for the tones.\nUnlike clinical populations who show delays in L1 acquisition, L2 learners (most of whom do not have a DLD) can be assumed to be competent in acquiring language. There is no reason to suspect that L2 child learners are poor phonological processors; however, their development of L1 and L2 speech perception and processing may still be delayed or different because they\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 10 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 706926\nhave less experience with each language or because they have experience of a different nature. A Turkish monolingual control group could have helped resolve the issue of whether the attenuated T-complex effects observed for the bilingual group are due to a different language background (Turkish) or due to specific limitations of the linguistic environment. Testing a German-Turkish bilingual group who were learning Turkish as an L2 could also address this question.\nThe T-complex measures in the bilingual children revealed immature patterns of sensory processing to acoustic stimuli. Specifically, the less positive Ta resembled the response in younger monolingual children (Shafer et al., 2015). Rinker et al. (2017) also included a Spanish-English bilingual group, who showed less positive Ta responses compared to English monolingual controls and these controls are the 4\u20135 years old children in Shafer et al. (2015). Thus, the pattern observed for bilingual children to a non-native vowel is replicated in two different language groups. Note that in the current study the Turkish and German data were filtered less strictly than\nin Rinker et al. (2017) to ensure that the Ta peak would not be suppressed. This current analysis showed the same general pattern of results as in Rinker et al. (2017). Specifically, less positive T-complex in the Turkish-German bilinguals compared to the German monolinguals. The novel finding in the current study, that Ta attenuation is also observed to simple tone stimuli in bilingual children will require replication. If replicated, the difference in T-complex measures in the bilingual group might reflect an immature pattern of sensory processing. Alternatively, the difference may be related to increased brain activation to auditory input in some neural populations that sums up at the scalp as less positive responses. Next, we discuss these considerations.\nThe introduction of an L2 early in life (perhaps before 5 years of age)may lead tomaintaining a higher level of plasticity into the grade-school years. In other words, introduction of an L2 during this early time period leads to extending a sensitive period for learning the language-specific speech patterns (Werker and Hensch, 2015).\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 11 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 706926\nPrevious studies have demonstrated declines in both perception and production of the fine-grained phonetic detail of an L2 with increasing age of acquisition (Flege et al., 1997; Hisagi et al., 2015). Studies of language ability and critical periods (which often have focused on grammar) have suggested a sensitive period for language input (we prefer \u2018\u2018sensitive\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018critical\u2019\u2019), sometime before adulthood, with some, but not all favoring the age of 5 years (Johnson and Newport, 1989; Birdsong and Molis, 2001; Hartshorne et al., 2018).\nOur data provide important insight by revealing that the nature of the brain response to L2 speech sounds may extend to non-speech. This finding suggests a modulatory effect on auditory cortical responses, triggered by bilingual input and experience. More specifically, bilingual input may modulate neural responses to non-speech stimuli; languages differ in phonotactic patterns, as well as phoneme inventory, each constituting different patterns of sound energy concentration (Intartaglia et al., 2017). Thus, the input from phonological patterns from two languages might modulate the maturation of cortical areas which more generally support auditory processing. It will be important to examine whether this bilingual difference in the T-complex is maintained into the adult years. An increased negativity of the T-complex for native-Polish adults (late learners of English) compared to native-English adults to a Polish phonotactic pattern within the context of a challenging task demonstrated that linguistic-level processing was reflected within this sensory processing component (Wagner et al., 2013). Whereas this result is at least consistent with the pattern found for these children, more studies with both child and adult bilinguals are necessary to confirm these patterns.\nFew studies have examined how early learning modulates the T-complex. An interesting study that focused on musical experience and absolute pitch (AP) perception, rather than speech, observed differences for these temporal measures in relation to these factors (Matsuda et al., 2019). Specifically, adult musicians (who all had childhood experience) compared to non-musicians showed greater asymmetry of the left vs. right T-complex, with the right showing more positive responses. In addition, those with AP showed increased negativity of the Na and Tb at the right site. The patterns of development across the childhood years, however, cannot be determined from this study, since the focus was on adults. Thus, it is currently unclear whether the increased negativity of the responses observed for the bilingual compared to monolingual children in our study would also be observed in older groups. Even so, these studies taken together demonstrate that both speech and non-speech auditory experiencemodulate T-complex responses.\nThe children with DLD further support our hypothesis that language experience can explain the pattern observed in our study. Specifically, the T-complex responses for a subset of the children with DLD to tones were very similar to children with TD. In contrast, an attenuated T-complex response in a child with bilingual input may indicate that the auditory cortex is plastic and allows modification. Future studies will be needed to test these hypotheses. In particular, it will be\nimportant to examine the T-complex in relation to the age of acquisition of the L2 and/or to follow children with bilingual exposure longitudinally to learn whether or not the T-complex for bilingual and monolingual children at older ages follow a similar trajectory."

The figures show almost identical patterns for the children with TD and DLD for the Na-Ta-Tb AEPs at both left and right sites.\nThe (weak) correlation of Na to the vowels with the EG and RG language scores appears to be driven by a subset of the children with DLD showing attenuated Na (see Figure 3). Other studies of children with DLD also have shown poor T-complex to speech (Shafer et al., 2011a; Bishop et al., 2012). Future studies will be needed with a larger N, but which also provide a more fine-grained measure of the language deficits of children with DLD to fully understand the association between T-complex measures and language behaviors in children with DLD.

            "text": "As mentioned above, one potential contributing factor to our lack of finding of a difference between the children with DLD and those with TD for the tone condition is variability, which might be due to the heterogeneous nature of DLD (Shafer et al., 2011a; Bishop et al., 2016). It is possible that only a small proportion of the children with DLD in the current study had phonological processing deficits. Children with comorbid DLD and dyslexia (\u223c30\u201340% of children with DLD), compared to those with DLD alone, were found to have phonological processing deficits (McArthur and Bishop, 2004; Catts et al., 2005; Boada and Pennington, 2006; Bishop et al., 2009; Rispen and Baker, 2012). These deficits might be caused by impaired processing of spectral (McArthur and Bishop, 2005; Ceponiene et al., 2009) and/or temporal acoustic characteristics (Tallal and Piercy, 1973; Benasich and Tallal, 2002). The children in the current study had not yet learned to read (children in Germany enter school at 6 years of age). Thus, it is unknown which of these children might have dyslexia (diagnosed at a later age). It will be important in a future study to examine whether poor T-complex measures are specifically associated with dyslexia.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 12 January 2022 | Volume 15 | Article 706926"

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "The small samples of the current study and the absence of large effects warrant caution when interpreting the results. However, the three groups were clearly differentiated by the behavioral language measures and by input (bilingual vs. monolingual context). Thus, we can infer that it is unlikely that a large effect will be observed in a future study comparing children with TD and DLD, except in the case that heterogeneity is narrowed, as we suggest above, by examining reading skills.\nWith respect to the bilingual children, a monolingual Turkish control group would have helped to disentangle the effects of Turkish vs. German. This was not possible due to practical constraints. In addition, the observed effects need to be followed up with children growing up with other language combinations (such as English-Spanish or Italian-German).\nThe correlation between the T-complex measures and the different language scores were, at most, fairly weak and did not reach significance after correcting for the number of comparisons. In addition, the N for each group was too small to justify examining the relationship between these measures and each language group. A future study with more participants in each group will be necessary to determine whether language skill has a linear relationship to the T-complex measures.\nDue to theoretical considerations guiding the original MMN-study (Rinker et al., 2010, 2014) the vowel and sine tone stimuli did not have the same duration. Future studies should compare processing for vowels and tones of the same duration.\nA further limitation is that input patterns in German and Turkish were calculated from a parent questionnaire, thus potentially resulting in under- or overestimations of the input. Future studies would be better informed with a more direct measure of input, such as using LENA (Garc\u00eda-Sierra et al., 2016) however, LENA has not yet been normed for use with typical heritage languages in Germany, such as Turkish."

            "text": "This study is the first to perform a three-way comparison of neural responses (T-complex) to speech and non-speech stimuli in monolingual children with TD, bilingual children with TD, and monolingual children with DLD. The main finding was that the T-complex measures to both speech and tones were modulated by language input and language processing abilities. As all children between 5 and 6 years of\nage are still showing a developing T-complex and heterogeneity among this age group is likely to be high, further studies are needed to elucidate the role between input, maturation, and disorder."
