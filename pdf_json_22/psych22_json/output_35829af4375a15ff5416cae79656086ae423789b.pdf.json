            "text": "This methodological essay explores researchers' ability to understand the existential aspects of enhancing sensitive care services. Our claims are mostly based on others' work, but in the discussion, we provide a nuanced argument supporting a step forward. In this context, we draw on nurse researcher Kathleen Galvin to whom \u201ca vocabulary of existential knowledge\u201d must be created ([1], p. 681). Existential knowledge, according to Galvin, refers to pre- disciplinary concerns with what it means to live; and she argues that, in this respect, we have only just begun articulating which existential phenomena may inform caring practices.\nWhen exploring how existential phenomena are important in guiding caring practice, we may draw on qualitative research. However, in Galvin's view, we have no language with which to express what well- being means or to adequately describe the consequences of its absence. Indeed, the predominant focus in healthcare comes at the cost of a lack of vocabulary to adequately describe what people go through and how lived phenomena are experienced\u2014 for example, mental health challenges, homelessness or loneliness. To capture existential knowledge in this sense, knowing its psychological and sociological underpinnings is insufficient [2]; we need an existential, qualitative vocabulary. Or in philosopher Finn Thorbj\u00f8rn Hansen's words:\na special kind of philosophical openness or the philosophical presence of \u2018something\u2019 that cannot be grasped directly through common scientific language or qualitative research methods (\u2026) through the particular presence and awareness created by an scientific- empirical approach or a qualitativemethodological approach.\n([3], p. 2)\nAccording to Galvin, verbal inroads to such complex, embodied experiences are fundamental to providing ethically sensitive and sustainable caring [4].\nEssentially, what Galvin and clinical psychologist Les Todres argue is that technical knowledge of different kinds of dignity or levels of well- being may metaphorically be dubbed \u201cknowledge for the head\u201d ([1], p. 681). However, we need more. We also need knowledge of the aesthetics of complex embodied phenomena; metaphorically described as \u201cknowledge for the heart.\u201d Additionally, we need to be\nable to interact in response to these phenomena, which can be captured in the metaphor \u201cknowledge for the hand\u201d ([1], p. 681).\nSo, building knowledge for the head, heart and hand requires command of verbal resources and existential experience that are up to this sensitive task, exceeding both academic philosophy, psychology and sociology. Therefore, as healthcare professionals and researchers, we cannot simply adopt an instrumental approach to care and research\u2014 we need to \u201cbe\u201d caring and researching. We need to ask ourselves the following questions: (A) What does human science exploring human existence search for? (B) Which researcher competences are required? (C) Which theoretical and practical approaches and dimensions may enhance the researchers' competences? Seeking answers to these three questions, we argue that research may be sensitised by drawing on sensitive responses and developing a capacity for openness towards the other person, thereby providing an embodied, relational and humanising approach to research and practice.\nThe aim of this essay is to identify personal competences and approaches that enhance research exploring \u201cwhat it is like\u201d\u2014 understanding human existence."

            "text": "Research into the meaning structures of our lived experiences provides us with a better understanding of what it means to be in the world as individuals\u2014 aspects of being are, indeed, meaningful. According to pedagogue Van Manen, \u201chuman science research is rigorous in a moral and spirited sense\u201d ([5], p. 18) and such research is characterised by its ability and determination to defend its uniqueness and dedication. Following Van Manen, \u201ca rigorous human science is prepared to be \u2018soft\u2019, \u2018soulful\u2019, \u2018subtle\u2019 and \u2018sensitive\u2019\u201d ([5], p. 18). However, these phenomena are \u201cpreverbal\u201d and we are therefore hardly able to describe the basics about the experiences of lived time, lived space, lived body and lived human relation, that is, our lifeworld [1]. Terms such as \u201cpoetic enquiry,\u201d \u201caesthetic phenomenology\u201d and an \u201cexistential theory of well- being\u201d can be seen as foundations of a new vocabulary that might be helpful [6]. Taking this path, phenomenology must, according to Hansen, be tuned to a less\nK E Y W O R D S\ncontemplation, creativity, narrative, phenomenology, qualitative approaches, research in practice, research methods\n14716712, 0, D ow nloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/scs.13125 by Janne D am sgaard - R eadcube (L abtiva Inc.) , W iley O nline L ibrary on [18/10/2022].

However, according to psychologist Buytendijk, a great novelist may provide more nuanced psychological insights through character descriptions than may be gained from reading psychological social science books and journals because the novelist transforms and fictionalises ordinary human experience in endless variety [7]. In this perspective, poetic dwelling or poetic presence is not, for Hansen, only relevant to bring into play at the findings stage, but (as in art- based research), phenomenology should start (and be led and end) by an aesthetical attunement towards what is essential and calling to us in our meeting with the phenomenon [3]. Following Hansen, \u201cthis embodied and aesthetical \u2018musicality\u2019 should not only be seen as a communicative means or vehicle for the scientific finding of the phenomenological researcher, but also as a way of being and listening, which directs and leads the researcher to his or her findings\u201d ([3], p. 6).\nCaring and research\u2014 Embodied relational understanding\nOur \u201ctraditional\u201d notion of propositional knowledge falls short of capturing the complexity of the kinds and levels of knowledge that are needed in caring and qualitative research practices [4]. Indeed, knowledge relevant to such practices does not easily adhere to traditional categories such as science, arts and ethics. As an example of a more complex view and understanding of knowledge, Galvin and Todres have developed a characterisation of knowledge coined \u201cembodied relational understanding\u201d:\n\u201c\u2026 a way of knowing that is holistically contextual, i.e., a form of knowledge that is attentive to the rich and moving flow of individuals lives in relation to others, to very specific situations, and to the inner worlds of what it is like for people (patients) to \u2018go through something\u2019.\u201d\n([4], p. 148)\nIn their view, knowing represents three sensibilities that capture three knowledge domains encompassing technical evidence, practical knowing and an imaginative/ethical\ncapacity. When these three sensibilities are integrated, a \u201cholistic\u201d sensibility is created. Philosopher E.T. Gendlin refers to such knowledge as \u201ca \u2018thick\u2019 pattern of knowing in which knowledge is a resource guided or encapsulated in the living relationships (the lifeworld)\u201d ([8], p. 269\u2013 294). This knowledge resource represents \u201cthe thickness of living\u201d, identifying the contextual world's richness and flow, that is, the world as it is lived by humans.\nUnderstanding this is essential in both a caring and research practice. Moreover, this understanding is informed by \u201ca complex form of knowing that is aesthetically textured and sensitive to unique situations\u201d ([8], p. 269\u2013 294). When human beings share worlds, they come to know one another's world in participatory ways. This, in turn, facilitates the addition of sensitivity and empathy to specialised knowledge. It follows that embodied relational understanding involves the display of an empathic understanding of another person's world coupled with an ability and competence to draw on resources that feed on both knowledge and openness; and the ability to apply these resources to concrete circumstances. We argue that embodied relational understanding offers a complex epistemology that can give \u201cheart\u201d and empathy to both caring practices and research practices. However, to get attuned to such \u201cembodied and aesthetically musicality,\u201d it is necessary to learn how to do phenomenology with a phenomenological attitude. Therefore, a closer description of what this attitude consists of is needed, qualifying phenomenological research.\nWHICH RESEARCHER COMPETENCES ARE REQUIRED? EMBODIED RELATIONAL RESEARCH"

We discover ourselves as part of the world, and the world is revealed to us through our bodies. As human beings, we experience both vulnerabilities and freedoms as part of our embodied existence. For example, illness impacts our body and our embodied existence with others ([10], p. 803). This knowing is full of personal meaning that is deeply felt."

It is well- known that educational resources facilitate empathic understanding [11\u2013 16]. However, we argue that researchers can benefit from engaging in such aspirations that begin from an awareness and sensitivity\u2014 an understanding\u2014 based on openness towards the others' (the participants') experiences rather than an approach based on the researchers' (practitioners') reflective resources and their experiences alone. Thus, referring to Galvin and Todres' concept of \u201cembodied interpretation,\u201d we advocate the pursuit of embodied relational research, applying the researchers' personal resources and being open and sensitive towards the other, exploring our complex lifeworld. By focusing on bodily sensed understanding, we will be led to a dimension that cannot be reached through the language of logical rigorous, precise and rational words. However, to avoid getting lost in psychological and psychocentric worldviews, we argue that we are not going far enough, trying to find ourselves in what language can only indirectly suggest. \u201cThere is a need for not only an \u2018emotional homecoming\u2019 (feelings can lead us astray from insights)\u2014 but also an \u2018existential homecoming\u2019\u201d ([3, 17], p. 3) that encompasses an ontological level and a contemplative \u201cbeing dimension.\u201d We argue that we should find ourselves in that which is not to be found only in language but rather in the relation between self, language (dialogue) and the other."

The question then becomes\u2014 how can we (as researchers) listen to and stay in the world in an ontological way of emotions, feelings and bodily sensed understandings can, in some situations, stand in our way of stepping further into a more meta- physical listening and adopting a being- in- the- world stance?\nAs argued above, an important focus for researchers refers to a way of knowing that is holistically contextual, that is, the knowledge that is attentive to the lives of others, to particular situations and to how people (e.g. patients/ users) experience going through something. To explore such emotional, bodily, existential and social areas, researchers need to be thoughtfully and sensitively attuned to those whose lives they study. An embodied relational understanding is therefore relevant in a research context.\nTo philosopher Martin Buber, there is a tendency to reduce human experience to inner psychological experiences\u2014 \u201cthe psychologization of the world\u201d [18]. This means that we relate to the world as an \u201cit,\u201d like a subject to an object [19]. Buber argued that this existential crisis of today is ontological and results in a growing (relational) distance between self and the other. He therefore turns to \u201crelation\u201d and \u201cdialogue.\u201d To Buber, dialogue does not necessarily require a spoken language [22]. Existence and dialogue are related and transcend the limitations of persons holding an \u201cinner\u201d (psychological) space. Buber saw language as a means to express emotions. However, language, as we usually understand it, is not necessarily sufficient to bring the world (i.e. meaningful existence) closer to us ([20], p. 106). To Buber, language\u2014 \u201cgenuine dialogue\u201d\u2014 contains supra- or sub- linguistic ways of expression such as gestures, facial expressions and even silence. The characteristics of a dialogical person are, therefore, the possibility of and ability to \u201cbe present.\u201d An awareness towards what \u201cis\u201d present, in a movement towards the other, without forgetting oneself. This (presence) is the key to genuine dialogue\u2014 to a meaningful life.\nIn this relational perspective, the researcher is present at an attentive pace, not listening only to his or her feelings but also to what seems to transcend what can be captured both in words and sensations. Following Hansen (and Buber), in this sense, \u201cthe new and unknown appears\u201d ([3], p. 9). This is \u201ca not- expecting- to- know attitude\u201d and a kind of \u201cbreakdown of our certainties\u201d (cognitive and emotional). This is, according to Hansen, \u201cbecoming in tune and in dialogue with the ontological mood that silently exist as the tacit backdrop of our existence\u201d ([3], p. 11).\nOn these grounds, we argue that the understanding and research of existential well- being need a worldview that is also connected to the life experience of what matters in life\u2014 an \u201cethical self- care.\u201d We claim that thoughts of what a good, beautiful and wise life consists of are\nnloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/scs.13125 by Janne D am sgaard - R eadcube (L abtiva Inc.) , W iley O nline L ibrary on [18/10/2022].

Following this, research (and educational practice) methodologies transcending the limitations of \u201cinner\u201d (psychological) space allow researchers to connect to the other's experience. This embodied relational approach may therefore be a resource to researchers and health professionals promoting a more holistic, collaborative and personal approach enhancing the presence and self- awareness\u2014 increasing the understanding of \u201cwhat it is like\u201d being a patient/user\u2014 being human.\nBased on this, we understand Embodied Relational Research as a unifying stance and resource between embodiment and relation\u2014 embracing the dimension between self, language (dialogue) and the other. This builds on contemplative, sensitive and creative competences that may serve to empower the research process and care\u2014 giving us a deeper insight into existential elements of service users', for example, patients', families', clients' and healthcare professionals' experiences'\u2014 sensing \u201cwhat it is like.\u201d This, we argue, is an important perspective crucial to apply to (research) practice. But how do we move into this?\nWHICH THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL APPROACHES AND DIMENSIONS MAY ENHANCE RESEARCHERS' COMPETENCES PROMOTING EMBODIED RELATIONAL RESEARCH?\nAs argued, existential phenomena are often \u201cpreverbal\u201d; and it can therefore be difficult to describe the basic aspects of the experiences of lived time, lived space, lived body and lived human relation, that is, our lifeworld. Citing Buber, we therefore \u201cseek to find a way of using language\u201d ([18], p. 570). We need an existential and qualitative vocabulary. As indicated above, this comes with several methodological challenges. On the one hand, research methods that interpret the meaning of utterances draw on language to divulge implicit and unconscious structures. On the other, language may also disguise or, indeed, fall short of giving words to embodied experiences."

            "text": "In the literature, it is argued that, although narratives are used as text, the phenomenological analysis goes beyond narrative structure and personal meaning to explore meaning units that are often sensed or felt as much as thought about; thus narratives, per se, are not a problem. However,\nwe argue that relying solely on what can be narrated, for example exploring brutal life occurrences, may come at a risk. Psychologist Stephen Frosh [21] argues that at some point discourse falls short and language is characterised not by its expressive capacity, but by its insufficiency and inability to convey what is known in and by the person in question. For example, a narrative may be unable to convey the full spectrum of sensations and emotions; perhaps these cannot even be rendered in words. Inaccessible and inexpressible experiences important to people's psychological (and professional) functioning in life may be rooted in critical incidents or traumatic events. So, using the narrative as the only approach may be perceived as too reductionist for processing and conveying such emotionally troubling events. \u201cThings that cannot be said are often at the core of our experience; \u2018we are what they are\u2019\u201d [22].\nThis challenge is also accentuated by psychologist Ruth Leitch [22]. To Leitch, using narratives in research recognises that people consciously attribute meaning to their stories. However, as individuals, we may not be conscious or aware of what is personal and unique to us even if it does, indeed, bear strongly on our experience, life and identity. A critique raised by Leitch is that narrative inquiry as it is conceptualised and practiced therefore often does not fully capture what is personal and unique to a human being\u2014 such embodied knowledge goes beyond the intellectual, logical and rational mode of thinking including \u201cemotions, culture, physical sensation and life experiences'\u201d ([23], p. 35). Indeed, inquiry and writing in their traditional forms are unable to fully capture embodied knowledge in the same manner as a picture, an image or some other piece of art [22].\nAccording to Buber, we may aim to reflect not just on the voices of the I/self but also on the us/thou which inhibits an equally metaphysical agency\u2014 \u201cwho and where am I in relation to the voices of other and the true shibboleth of humanity?\u201d ([18], p. 115). Following Buber, we may end up getting stuck in sentimental feelings\u2014 the poem (the text) has not created the space between on the one hand the subject matter (the call of the phenomenon) and on the other hand the voice of the person who responds to this calling. Citing the Danish writer Poul La Cour, \u201cYou must penetrate with your own primordial movement of the mind (or soul) and fight with it to become signs\u201d ([24], p. 75). This is (the hermeneutic) momentum where the process moves from poetry to research seeking the universal in the concrete with an awareness (a sensitive ear) for what cannot be expressed in clear thoughts (and words) directly. We therefore argue that art and/or contemplation not only offer alternative, metaphorical starting points or way stations that allow different sorts of analytical journeys but moreover may serve as elements that transcend what we lack in words, expressing lived experience, trying to find ourselves in that which may not be found in\nnloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/scs.13125 by Janne D am sgaard - R eadcube (L abtiva Inc.) , W iley O nline L ibrary on [18/10/2022].

See Table\u00a01 for examples of art- based inquiry and creative research approaches.\nGrappling with the problem of unconsciousness and seeking to understand the nuances and subtlety of human experience is an inherent part of conducting qualitative research. The question is then how to \u201copen\u201d and explicate aspects of people's experience that are not readily verbalised.\nDimensions that open: Contemplative inquiry\nQualitative research seeking to unveil embodied relational experience should strive to be contemplative. This involves engaging in deep communication with the respondents, including allowing periods of silence/pauses in our thinking to gain even deeper insight. According to Valerie Janesick, qualitative research is contemplative in the sense that every aspect or component of research is subject to conscious thoughts [32].\nJanesick defines contemplative qualitative research as follows:\n\u201cThis practical concept is useful for those of us using qualitative methods to make sense of people's lives: we are connected to our participants whether or not we wish to be. I call this approach contemplative qualitative inquiry. The contemplative component has to do with the stillness and silence of thinking with a meditative orientation.\u201d\n([32], p. 22)\nIn contemplative research, we seek not to prove or verify hypotheses but to understand \u201cthe other\u201d and the social worlds of which he or she is part. According to Janesick, this\nrequires full openness and awareness of one's own assumptions and pre- understandings\u2014 an openness and awareness that may be gained through contemplation and intuitive listening (see paragraph below Contemplation and intuitive listening). Within this perspective, Janesick applies aspects of Zen Buddhism to research practice\u2014 see Figure\u00a01.\nTo Janesick, Zen is creative and can enhance creative qualitative research [32]. Indeed, Zen plays with language and words as is the case in Zenic poetry, Haiku. The ability to analyse, for example, pieces of art\u2014 be they documents, photographs or artefacts\u2014 requires being conscious of compassion and creativity. We argue that the ability to contemplation is crucial when exploring lived experiences employing Embodied Relational Research.\nExamples of mindful activities promoting contact with \u201cwhat it is like\u201d\nAccording to sociologist Krzysztof Konecki, a researcher's use of poetry, photography, drawings\u2014 art\u2014 can contribute to the written narrative in important ways [33]. For example, by experimenting with photographs during qualitative research, human science may help us to interpret phenomena and to reach their meanings; to see the phenomenon in a different way and help us form new interpretations of an embodied relational experience. Mindful activities may underpin qualitative research ([32], p. 86\u2013 88). For example, it may be useful to take down notes on what we experienced during the day. Writing a poem may also be helpful when interpreting texts or documents. Following Janesick, poetry may be used as an instrument to capture meaning\u2014 to capture deep meaning [32]. Writing poetry after having read documents or transcribed data may inspire new, creative interpretations of texts because it allows us to notice hitherto imperceptible things [34], to capture the eidetic features of a phenomenon.\nT A B L E 1 Examples of creative research approaches [22, 25\u2013 31]\nAutobiographical time- lines\nUsing simple drawings or paintings, participants are invited to make a symbolic or creative representation of important life events (from early life to the present day; both positive and negative; both private and professional and the emotions associated with these events). In the study by Ruth Leitch, the creative task was based on critical incident analysis [25, 26] and on the work of Martin [27].\nSelf- system pictures Creating a painting or drawing exploring the felt relationship between themselves and their current school/ organisation and the people within it, participants illustrate how they see themselves as part of a system. This approach integrates Moxnes' [28] ideas about the unconscious in organisations and ideas about visual metaphors to explore organisational dynamics and power structures by Miller and Boist [29].\nMask making In Leitch's study, the task was an adaptation from McMurray's (31 p. 62) therapeutic work. The participants were invited to use various craft materials to create a three- dimensional \u201cembodied image\u201d ([30], p. 86). The \u201cembodied image\u201d symbolised the face they present (as a teacher) and participants were invited to consider whether or not an \u201cinner face\u201d existed, which they wished to represent. This approach is inspired by a long tradition of using masks in theatre and therapy.\nnloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/scs.13125 by Janne D am sgaard - R eadcube (L abtiva Inc.) , W iley O nline L ibrary on [18/10/2022].

Writing a reflective journal is also \u201ca contemplative activity that allows the researcher to reflect on his or her role and identity in the study, and free him- or herself from the limitations of his/her identity, or to observe these limitations\u201d ([32], p. 132). A reflective journal may also allow the researcher to document feelings and impressions from interviews or to substantiate the usefulness of other research techniques."

One such question can be: \u2018Who am I?\u2019\u201d\n[35]\nHowever, the answer to \u201cwho am I\u201d is never definitive. The answers may be many; however, if the researcher has no thought about answers, then asking the respondent to elaborate on the question is evidently difficult. To Konecki, meditation and contemplation are ways of divorcing oneself as a researcher from prejudices and hence avoiding the risk of simply confirming prior knowledge. \u201cIf I create a space where \u2018nothing\u2019 exists for a moment, I can observe images, words, that I may notice now and did not notice before\u201d ([36], p. 14). Intuitive listening, according to Konecki, involves observing habitually imperceptible things and \u201cappears as a vague image, a feeling, or some inner vague power\u201d ([36], p. 14).\nProfessor in contemplative research Petitmengin\u2013 Peugeot develops these thoughts, highlighting that being calm and listening, that is, engaging in intuitive listening, will raise the researcher's awareness and allow subtle sensations to be perceived ([37], p. 71\u2013 72). Intuitive listening allows the researcher to observe the \u201cbody's feelings,\u201d which often informs us earlier about sensations both in and outside of ourselves. \u201cThe body and its position often determine the meanings we give to the world and how we understand it and how we perceive it\u201d ([38], p. 152\u2013 64).\nTo sociologist Byczkowska- Owczarek, \u201casking questions in silence\u201d, that is, the questions that the researcher asks him- or herself when being alone, may assist the researcher in transcending the usual limits of consciousness and avoiding the constraints of the more traditional, formal scientific setting (conferences, debates, etc.) [38]. Asking questions in silence allows the researcher to remain open in time and space for an intuitive experience and to explore issues such as which language to use to express a particular experience, and when and to whom it should be expressed [38]. To Byczkowska- Owczarek, our imagination is often restricted by the image we have of a particular audience, and this may suppress the idea that emanates from our intuition. Intuition can be understood as first thought [38]; it is associated with spontaneity and instantaneousness. It is usually an unlaboured solution to problems that have escaped the confines of analytic mode. Intuition may be expressed in words, but also through images. Intuition may arise from meditation and allow us to see \u201cthe coexistence of the multiplicity of things in the world\u201d ([39], p. 58). Observing or feeling these relationships, \u201cbodily feelings about interdependence are important in creative work when we try to associate certain phenomena or objects to create new relationships and perhaps even objects\u201d ([35, 40], p. 193\u2013 238). Noticing the interdependence of phenomena allows us, in Konecki's words, to \u201cfind new relationships\u201d between these phenomena, and it makes us more creative.\nExploring our lifeworld, engaging in Embodied Relational Research, we argue that daring to engage in\nF I G U R E 1 Qualitative and Zen research is:\nHOLISTIC\nCONTEXT IS IMPORTANT\nBODY AND MIND ARE INSTRUMENTS\nOF COGNITION\nSTORYTELLING\nWRITING, INTUITION AND\nCREATIVITY\nnloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/scs.13125 by Janne D am sgaard - R eadcube (L abtiva Inc.) , W iley O nline L ibrary on [18/10/2022].

Therefore, doing Embodied Relational Research, being creative and practicing creativity, it is tantamount going beyond known means of understanding and problem- solving\u2014 divorcing oneself from traditional perception and action patterns.\nHowever, if we have not understood the need for critical thinking and created a space for such thinking, we are not in a position to question the existing patterns of thought and action [36]. Therefore, criticism lies at the root of creative thinking, and we must constantly strive to be critical of how we focus and what we focus on, not least because this is often determined by group thinking striving for consensus and harmony. Indeed, going against group thinking commands courage and confidence in oneself and one's thoughts as a researcher. Courage, we argue, is therefore crucial when daring to enter and engage in Embodied Relational Research activities."

Knowledge of existential phenomena such as well- being and lifeworld challenges requires existential resources. Human (phenomenological and hermeneutical) science is rigorous in a spirited sense and distinguishes itself by having the courage to defend uniqueness and significance. Human- centred science that is prepared to be thoughtful and sensitive may heighten our reflective awareness of a range of meanings of life's phenomena. Indeed, capturing what is most common and familiar to us, it may offer us animating, evocative textual descriptions capturing the breadth of human actions, behaviours, intentions and experiences that we encounter in the lifeworld. Drawing on the works of poets, authors, artists and filmmakers, human scientists may create or interpret a situated person, and they may productively draw on art's ability to represent the variety of human experience in a condensed and transcended form.\nAn important focus and adaptation for researchers is what we have termed \u201cEmbodied Relational Research,\u201d which refers to a way of knowing that is holistically contextual, that is, the knowledge attentive to the lives of others, to particular situations and to how people (e.g. patients/users) experience going through something.

Poetry is an instrument with which to capture deep meaning because it is open, creative and allows new perspectives of interpretation to surface. Writing poetry after having read documents or transcribing them may inspire new and creative interpretations of texts. Poetry may allow us access to deeper meaning layers in texts about a phenomenon. It allows us to notice imperceptible things and eidetic features of a phenomenon [32].\nPhotography To understand and interpret phenomena experimenting with photographs may be helpful; for example, arranging photos in a particular sequence may help us see the phenomenon in a different way and give way to novel interpretations of the researched phenomenon [32].\nWriting reflective journals\nWriting a reflective journal is a contemplative activity. This approach holds several potential advantages; firstly, it may allow the researcher to reflect on his/her role and identity in the study; secondly, it may free the researcher from the limitations introduced by his/her identity and role; or allow him/her to observe these limitations; thirdly, it may allow the researcher to record feelings and impressions obtained from interviews and the use of other research techniques [32].\nMeditation, intuitive listening\nMeditation invites the researcher to enter a contemplative state, offering room for reflection on his/her existential condition of being in the world, seeking answers to questions like \u201cWho am I?\u201d Although interesting answers to this question may appear, none of them will be the ultimate answers. However, without raising such questions and seeking answers to them, how may the researcher seek answers to such questions from respondents? I start seeing connections with the \u201couter\u201d world. \u201cI am not outside; my space is in this space here and now and it determines my perception of the world\u201d [36, 40].\nnloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/scs.13125 by Janne D am sgaard - R eadcube (L abtiva Inc.) , W iley O nline L ibrary on [18/10/2022].

In this respect, \u201cembodiment\u201d is essential because bodily awareness allows the researcher insight into a kind of knowing that is full of deeply felt personal meaning. Following this, research (and educational) methodologies facilitating the presence, embracing the relation between self, language (dialogue) and the other, allow researchers to connect to the other's experience and may be a resource to healthcare professionals. We argue that researchers exploring humanity may benefit from engaging in such aspirations that begin from a presence, an awareness, a sensitivity and an understanding based on openness towards the other (the patients/users' experiences). To avoid research getting lost in psychological and psychocentric world views, we are not going far enough, trying to find ourselves in what language can only indirectly identify. There is a need for not only an \u201cemotional homecoming\u201d but also an \u201cexistential homecoming\u201d that encompasses an ontological level and a contemplative \u201cbeing dimension.\u201d Importantly, not all aspects of experience are readily available to awareness. Thus, several emotional, sensory and embodied dimensions of experience are difficult to access because they lie below the threshold of consciousness and therefore cannot be articulated. Non- verbal data, particularly in the form of embodied experience, may fall beyond the reach of a narrative. In this context, contemplative and creative dimensions are important to apply.\nImplications for (Embodied Relational Research) practice\u2014 Two key focus areas\nContemplation\nQualitative research adapting Embodied Relational Research is contemplative. Contemplation can be achieved by communicating with the respondents in ways that allow periods of silence\u2014 pauses in our thinking\u2014 to facilitate even deeper insight. These techniques command a strong focus on thinking in every part of a study. We argue that the ability to contemplation is crucial when exploring lived experiences. The more a person practices a calm inside and engages in the special mode of attention characterising intuitive listening, the more precious will his or her awareness (and thinking) be and the more subtle will be the sensations perceived. Essentially, this approach may allow for subtle human experiences.\nCreative dimensions\nCreativity is contained in the body. Doing lifeworld research, we therefore argue that by being open and daring\nto engage in contemplative and creative dimensions, we may enhance the researchers' competences qualifying the research processes and learning more about \u201cwhat it is like\u201d being human. A researcher's use of poetry, photography and drawings\u2014 art\u2014 is highly relevant as an addition to (the spoken and written) narrative. A creative ability may divulge new solutions to existing problems or allow the researcher to connect new ideas to existing and known ones.\nWithin this Embodied Relational Research perspective, it is our hope that researchers are willing to step outside their comfort zones in pursuit of knowledge about what it is like to be human."
