"Although warmer countries may report higher proportions of AMR, our study did not find a significant effect of temperature change. Rather, other factors—such as antibiotic use and a country’s governance—seem to determine a north-to-south geographical gradient for AMR. As a result of this evidence, ensuring the appropriate use of antibiotics and improving governance efficiency are the most effective ways to counteract AMR."
