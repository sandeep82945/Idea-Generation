1. **Investigate the effect of different synthesis methods on the physicochemical properties and catalytic activity of iron-modified mesoporous silica materials.** This could include varying the type of iron precursor, the synthesis temperature, and the calcination conditions. The goal would be to identify synthesis conditions that produce catalysts with high activity and stability for toluene oxidation at low temperatures.


2. **Explore the use of different mesoporous silica supports for iron-based catalysts.** In addition to SBA-15, AlSBA-15, and ZrSBA-15, other mesoporous silica materials such as MCM-41, MCM-48, and SBA-16 could be investigated. The goal would be to identify a support that provides the best combination of surface area, pore size, and stability for the iron-based catalyst.


3. **Study the effect of iron loading on the catalytic activity and stability of iron-modified mesoporous silica materials.** The goal would be to determine the optimal iron loading for achieving high activity and stability in toluene oxidation. This information could be used to design catalysts with tailored properties for specific applications.


4. **Investigate the role of metal-support interactions in the catalytic activity of iron-modified mesoporous silica materials.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. The goal would be to gain a better understanding of how the interaction between iron and the mesoporous silica support affects the catalyst's activity and stability.


5. **Explore the use of iron-modified mesoporous silica materials for the oxidation of other VOCs.** In addition to toluene, other VOCs such as benzene, xylene, and formaldehyde could be investigated. The goal would be to determine the applicability of iron-modified mesoporous silica materials for the removal of a wide range of VOCs from polluted air.
