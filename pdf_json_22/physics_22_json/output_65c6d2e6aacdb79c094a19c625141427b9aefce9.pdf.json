            "text": "Blazars are a subclass of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). According to the optical emission/absorption line features, they can be divided into two subclasses: flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacaerte objects (BL Lacs). Blazars have been observed at all wavebands from radio to gamma-ray bands. Their spectral energy distributions display a typical structure with two main peaks which locate at the low energy bands from the radio to the X-ray band, and high energy gamma-ray band, respectively (e.g. Falomo, Pian & Treves 2014).\nIt is widely accepted that the low energy component arises mainly from synchrotron radiation emitted by ultrarelativistic electrons in the jet. In addition, the accretion disk, dusty torus and broad line region (BLR) have also significant contributions to the low energy component (e.g. Ghisellini et al. 2019). The high energy peak can be explained with leptonic models, in which the high energy \u03b3\u2212rays are generated by inverse Compton scattering of the lowenergy photons by the same ultrarelativistic electrons in the jet (e.g. Dermer & Schlickeiser 1993; Sokolov et al. 2004; B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2013) , or with hadronic models, in which the high-energy emission\n\u22c6 E-mail: zhangbk_ynu@163.com \u2020 E-mail: cubewuqi@163.com\nis dominated by the synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic protons or the photopion production followed by pion decay and subsequent cascade (e.g. M\u00fccke et al. 2003; Murase et al. 2012). However, the emission mechanism remains an open question.\nBlazars exhibit large and rapid variations on a variety of time scales from years to even shorter than an hour, and their flux variations are always accompanied by their color variations, i.e., optical spectral variations. The study of the color variations is helpful to understand the emission mechanisms. Many works have investigated the color variation behaviors in the optical band (e.g. Vagnetti, Trevese & Nesci 2003; Gu et al. 2006; Rani et al. 2010; Ikejiri et al. 2011; Bonning et al. 2012; Wierzcholska et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015; Mao & Zhang 2016; Li et al. 2018; Meng et al. 2018; Gaur et al. 2019; Safna et al. 2020; Negi et al. 2022; Zhang, Zhao & Wu 2022, and references therein). Generally, there are two main types of color variation behaviors. One behavior is commonly called bluer-when-brighter (BWB) in brief, which means that the source becomes bluer (i.e., spectrum becomes flatter) when the brightness increases (e.g. Takalo & Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 1989; Raiteri et al. 2015; Dai et al. 2009; Gupta et al. 2019). Another phenomena is generally referred to as redder-when-brighter (RWB), which denotes that the source turns redder (i.e., spectrum turns steeper) as the brightness increases (e.g. Villata et al. 2006; Raiteri et al. 2017).\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nPrevious results showed that most of FSRQs exhibit redder-whenbrighter trends, and BL Lacs tend to display bluer-when-brighter hehaviors. However, there also exists other special phenomena, and there seem to be lack of unique behaviors for blazars. Meanwhile, BWB and RWB trends cannot always well describe the characteristics of the color variations of blazars (e.g. Zhang et al. 2015). Therefore, the segmented linear functions were attempted to characterize the color variation features (e.g. Yuan et al. 2017; Fan et al. 2018; Sarkar et al. 2019; Safna et al. 2020; Xiong et al. 2020; Fang et al. 2022). However, it is difficult to explain the abrupt inflection. Recently, Zhang, Zhao & Wu (2022) have found two universal phenomena universal optical spectral behaviors for blazars with the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) monitoring data. In the low state, the optical spectrum gradually becomes flatter or steeper, but more and more slowly as the brightness increases, and then tends to stabilize in the high state. These two phenomena are briefly named the bluer-stable-whenbrighter (BSWB) and redder-stable-when-brighter (RSWB) behaviors, respectively. They have also successfully constructed a nonlinear function to describe quantitatively the optical behavior of blazars well, and given a reasonable physical explanation.\nThe purpose in this work is to further investigate the optical spectral features with a different large sample of fermi blazars. In Section 2, the blazar sample and their light curves of optical V and R bands are introduced. And then, the optical spectral indices are calculated and the spectral behaviors are described in Section 3, followed by a detailed discussion in Section 4 and brief conclusions in the last section."

            "text": "Since the optical spectrum follows a power law and there are only two optical band (V and R) measurements, we have determined the spectral index by the formula\n\u03b1 = logF\u03bd2 \u2212 logF\u03bd1 log\u03bd2 \u2212 log\u03bd1 , (1)\nwhere \u03bd represents the frequency, and F\u03bd represents the flux. The spectral index for each V and R pair has been obtained.\nThe relation of the optical spectral index \u03b1 with the flux FR has been explored. As a typical example, the left panel of Fig. 2 plots the spectral index versus optical R band flux of BL Lac object 1ES 1959+650, which shows spectral index varies with the flux. From the figure, one can distinctly see the value of the optical spectral index gradually gets larger as the flux increases, which means that the optical spectrum becomes flatter (harder) when the flux increases, in the sense that the source becomes bluer when it brightens. However,\n2 https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/\nthe spectral index and the flux follow a distinct non-linear relation. It is clear that the spectral index increases step by step as the flux increases, but more and more slowly, and finally tends to be stable. This phenomenon is the typical bluer-stable-when-brighter (BSWB) trend.\nThe right panel of Fig. 2 displays another representative example, an opposite spectral behavior of FSRQ B2 1633+382. When the source brightens, the value of the spectral index decreases gradually, i.e. the optical spectrum progressively becomes steeper (softer), but more and more slowly, and then eventually tends to stabilize. In other words, the color becomes redder, and tends to be stable when the source brightens. This behavior is the representative redderstable-when-brighter (RSWB) trend.\nAlthough the behaviors of BSWB and RSWB exhibit opposite trends in low states, they share a common feature that the spectrum tend to stabilize when the source becomes brighter. To quantitatively characterize the relationship between the spectral index \u03b1 and the R band flux FR, we employ a non-linear function,\n\u03b1 = 2.67ln(a+b/FR), (2)\nproposed by Zhang, Zhao & Wu (2022), to fit the curve of \u03b1 versus FR, with two free parameters of a and b. The fitted results as well as the 99% confidence level bands are superimposed on Fig. 2 with dashed and dash-dotted lines. The \u03c72 values are 6.58 and 315.69, respectively. Both of them are consistent well with the trends of the spectral behaviors.\nTo compare with the linear fitting, we fit the curves of Fig. 2 with the equation\n\u03b1 = a+bFR, (3)\nwith two free parameters of a and b. The results are plotted on Fig. 3. The \u03c72 values are 16.77 and 599.27, respectively. They do not seem to be as good as those in Fig. 2. We carry out White\u2019s test to diagnose whether there is heteroscedasticity in the fitting process.

For equation (2), the corresponding p-values are 0.74 and 0.25. The test means that at 1% significance level, the fitting with equation (3) exist evidence heteroscedasticity, while the fitting with equation (2) has no heteroscedasticity. White\u2019s test suggests that the fitting results with non-linear equation (2) are better than those with linear equation (3).\nFor two equations, we also calculate the Bayesian information criterion (BICs) which is one of the popular statistical approaches for the comparative evaluation among different models. The model with the lower BIC values is preferred. For these two blazars, BICs of equation (2) are 10 and 284 lower than those of equation (3), which suggests that equation (2) is the preferred model to describe the spectral behavior.\nThe optical spectral features of other objects are all investigated, and the behaviors are listed in Column 5 of Table 1, and also displayed in Figs. 4 - 8 for BL Lac objects and Figs. 9 - 12 for FSRQs. One can notice that the variation trends of spectral index \u03b1 with flux FR exhibit BSWB or RSWB trends, and do not seem to follow linear relations. Therefore, we fit the spectral behavior by means of equations (2) and (3) for each source, and only superimpose the fitting results with equation (2) on the corresponding figures. The \u03c72 values fitted by equation (2) for 20 sources are lower or equal than those by equation (3). For 24 sources, equation (2) has lower or equal BICs than equation (3). Only 3 sources has higher BICs with equation (2) than equation (3). White\u2019s test for equation (2) show that there are 19 sources with p-value > 0.01, which means that the heteroscedasticity is not statistically significant. In general, the nonlinear equation (2) can well describe the optical spectral features, and is superior to the linear equation (3)."

            "text": "In total, the features of optical spectral behavior of 27 blazars have been explored, including 14 BL Lacs and 13 FSRQs. Generally, they follow the BSWB or RSWB trends well. Only one excep-\ntion PKS 0736+01 exhibits, on average, the stable-when-brighter (SWB) trend. In the past, the BWB or RWB trends were widely used to describe the spectral characteristics of blazars. However, an increasing number of hints indicate that BWB and RWB trends are insufficient to represent the spectral characteristics of blazars. It was observed that, as the source brightens and exceeds a certain value, the BWB or RWB trend was subsequently followed by a saturation phenomena (e.g. Villata et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2015, 2021; Sarkar et al. 2019; Safna et al. 2020; Xiong et al. 2020; Otero-Santos et al. 2022). That is, the color keeps stable when the source brightens above a certain level (stable-when-brighter, SWB). Recently, Zhang, Zhao & Wu (2022) found two new universal optical spectral behaviors, i.e., BSWB and RSWB trends, and inferred\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20139 (2022)\nthat both of them as well as the SWB trend can be regarded as special cases of BSWB and RSWB trends, respectively. The results of this work further confirm the existence of two spectral behaviors in the optical region, namely BSWB and RSWB trends.\nThe previous results suggest that most FSRQs exhibit a RWB trend, while most BL Lacs objects show BWB behavior (e.g. Safna et al. 2020, and references therein). Also, there exist exceptional cases, for example, all 6 BL Lacs show no\nBWB trends according to the data observed by the Rapid Eye Mounting (REM) telescope during April 2005 to June 2012 (Sandrinelli, Covino & Treves 2014), and another example is that only one out of 29 FSRQs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey stripe 82 region exhibits RWB trend (Gu & Ai 2011). Zhang, Zhao & Wu (2022) analyzed the spectral behaviors of 53 Fermi blazars, and their results showed that the vast majority of FSRQs exhibit RSWB\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20139 (2022)\ntrends, however, BL Lacs show no clear preference between BSWB and RSWB trends in their sample.\nWhen we examine the subclass of blazars in detail in this work, we find that 13 out of the 14 BL Lacs obey the BSWB trend, and only one exception, BL Lac object AO 0235+164, follows RSWB trend (see Figs. 4 - 8). For 13 FSRQs, there are 10 objects following the RSWB trend and 2 (3C 273 and 3C 279) following the BSWB trend (see Figs. 9 - 12). This means that BL Lacs are more inclined to\nexhibit BSWB trend and FSRQs are more inclined to exhibit RSWB trend. It seems that the spectral behavior of an object is independent of whether it is a TeV source.\nIn general, the relationship between spectral indices and fluxes can be well fitted by equation (2). In order to assess the fitting quality, we have examined the fitted results source by source. On closer inspection, the spectral feature can be generally fitted well in both high and low states. For instance, one can see that equation (2) is a\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20139 (2022)\ngood description of the spectral behavior of 1ES 1959 +650 whether the source is in a brighter or darker state, i.e., the flux is in the higher or lower part (see Fig. 2). Only 3 sources, CTA 102, 3C 454.3 and OJ 287, can not be well fitted in their very-high states. For each source, the spectral behaviors have been examined on different time scales. They have not only been investigated on several-year time-scales, but also been examined on several-day to several-month time-scales. Fig. 13 shows an example of a 12-day short-term spectral behavior of B2 1633+382 during MJD 58281\u201358293. The results demonstrate that the sources obey BSWB or RSWB trend on both longterm and short-term time-scales. And furthermore, the sources have been checked during different stages, and the results show that the sources follow the law of BSWB or RSWB well whether during the outburst or descent stage. Fig. 14 exhibits an case of the spectral behavior of 1ES 1959+650 when it is in an outburst stage during MJD 55600\u201356300.\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the phenomena of the spectral behavior. The two different spectral behaviors of BWB and RWB are explained by different models, and even for the same behavior, there exist different explanations. For the BWB trend, different models have been proposed, such as fresh electrons injection (Kirk, Rieger & Mastichiadis 1998), one-component synchrotron (Fiorucci, Ciprini & Tosti 2004), interband time delay (Wu et al. 2007), and two component contribution (Fiorucci, Ciprini & Tosti 2004; Ikejiri et al. 2011). Meanwhile, the RWB behavior has been interpreted as a strong contribution of a\nblue thermal emission from the accretion disc (Villata et al. 2006; Rani et al. 2010; Bonning et al. 2012; Isler et al. 2017), or changes in the Doppler factor (Raiteri et al. 2017). Zhang, Zhao & Wu (2022) suggested that the BWB and RWB trends are special cases of the BSWB and RSWB trends in low states, respectively, and both of them arise from the same mechanism. They proposed a new model with two constant-spectral-index components, and inferred a nonlinear formula, which can well explain both the BSWB and RSWB trends, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively.\nIn this study, the fact that both BSWB and RSWB behaviors can be well fitted by the same non-linear formula (equation (2)) implicates that both of them can be explained by the model of two constant-spectral-index components. The emission of optical band consists of a weak and relative stable thermal component, and a strong and highly variable synchrotron emission component, both of which have constant spectral indices. In the low state, the indices tend to be the thermal emission, while in the high state, since the emission begins to be dominated by the more variable non-thermal component, the index progressively approaches that of the nonthermal component. This mechanism naturally creates the BSWB or RSWB trend.\nBL Lacs have less thermal emission contributions than FSRQs, therefore, their colors of thermal component are much redder than those of FSRQs. And moreover, in most cases, for BL Lacs, the color of synchrotron emission component is bluer than that of the thermal component, so most of BL Lacs exhibit BSWB trend. While\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20139 (2022)\nfor FSRQs, the color of synchrotron emission component is redder than that of the thermal component, and as a result, most of them show RSWB trend. However, there are several exceptions. For example, AO 0235+164, as a BL Lac object, however, is more like an FSRQ in many physical aspects (Chen & Jiang 2001), and it has a much more luminous accretion disc than other BL Lacs, even can be comparable to FSRQs (Ghisellini et al. 2010; Paliya et al. 2021), so it follows the RSWB trend. The situation of the FSRQ 3C 279 is just the opposite, which implies that its thermal emission is relatively weak. As another special case, the source FSRQ 3C 273 has a strong blue component from the accretion disc (Fernandes et al.\n2020; Li et al. 2020), but it exhibits a slight BSWB trend, which may be due to its bluer synchrotron radiation. Whether it is BL Lac object or FSRQ, its spectral behavior ultimately depends on the quantitative comparison between the index of two components, namely, the thermal emission component from the accretion disc and the synchrotron radiation component from the jet."
