"Our results confirmed the stare-in-the-crowd effect in VR alongside the evidence that this effect is milder with people reporting higher social anxiety levels. With this, we showed that gaze can indeed change the focus of attention of a user, and potentially trigger the interaction with an agent. Such results are very encouraging, since they can improve our understanding of social interactions in VR applications and help design more engaging experiences with agents. For example, our gaze conditions could be used to initiate the interaction with the user in a virtual crowd. We also demonstrated a simple dynamic gaze condition that signals complex social behaviour, e.g., directed-then-averted gaze could potentially be interpreted as a sign of embarrassment of the agent. These subtle gaze conditions could be explored further to create more believable social interactions in VR."
