Exploration of Integrated Membrane Systems with Different Fruit Combinations: Investigating the effectiveness of integrated membrane processes (microfiltration, nanofiltration, and osmotic distillation) on other blends of fruits, focusing on those with high nutritional and medicinal values. This would help to determine the versatility of the membrane-based process for a wide range of fruit juices and plant extracts, and its effect on preserving or enhancing bioactive compounds, antioxidants, and other valuable nutrients.

Comparative Study on Membrane Technology vs. Other Non-Thermal Processes: Conducting comparative studies to evaluate the efficiency of membrane-based processes against other emerging non-thermal technologies (such as ultrasound, high pressure, pulsed light, pulsed electric field, and ozone processing) in preserving nutritional and functional qualities of fruit juices. This research could include aspects such as energy consumption, process scalability, and economic feasibility.

Development of New Membrane Materials and Configurations: Designing and testing new membrane materials or configurations that could further improve the selectivity, efficiency, and operational stability of the process. Innovations could aim at reducing fouling, enhancing flux, and increasing the retention of bioactive compounds, thereby improving the overall quality and health benefits of the concentrated juice products.

Health Impact Studies of Membrane-Processed Juices: Initiating clinical or preclinical studies to investigate the health impacts of consuming juices processed by integrated membrane systems. This research could focus on the bioavailability and efficacy of the preserved bioactive compounds in combating chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases, in comparison to their fresh counterparts and juices processed by traditional methods.

Application in Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods: Developing and testing formulations of nutraceuticals and functional foods incorporating concentrated juices obtained through membrane processes. This research could explore the use of these juices as natural colorants, flavorings, or bioactive ingredient carriers in a variety of food products, assessing their stability, sensory attributes, and health benefits. Additionally, the economic viability and consumer acceptance of such products could be examined to guide product development and market introduction strategies.
