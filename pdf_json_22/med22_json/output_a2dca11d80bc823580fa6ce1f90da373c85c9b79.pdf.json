    "abstractText": "Aberrant expression of dystrophin, utrophin, dysferlin, or calpain-3 was originally identified in muscular dystrophies (MDs). Increasing evidence now indicates that these proteins might act as tumor suppressors in myogenic and non-myogenic cancers. As DNA damage and somatic aneuploidy, hallmarks of cancer, are early pathological signs in MDs, we hypothesized that a common pathwaymight involve the centrosome. Here, we show that dystrophin, utrophin, dysferlin, and calpain-3 are functional constituents of the centrosome. In myoblasts, lack of any of these proteins caused excess centrosomes, centrosome misorientation, nuclear abnormalities, and impaired microtubule nucleation. In dystrophin double-mutants, these defects were significantly aggravated. Moreover, we demonstrate that also in non-myogenic cells, all four MD-related proteins localize to the centrosome, including themuscle-specific full-length dystrophin isoform. Therefore, MD-related proteins might share a convergent function at the centrosome in addition to their diverse, wellestablished muscle-specific functions. Thus, our findings support the notion that cancer-like centrosome-related defects underlie MDs and establish a novel concept linking MDs to cancer.",

Increasing evidence now indicates that these proteins might act as tumor suppressors in myogenic and non-myogenic cancers. As DNA damage and somatic aneuploidy, hallmarks of cancer, are early pathological signs in MDs, we hypothesized that a common pathwaymight involve the centrosome. Here, we show that dystrophin, utrophin, dysferlin, and calpain-3 are functional constituents of the centrosome. In myoblasts, lack of any of these proteins caused excess centrosomes, centrosome misorientation, nuclear abnormalities, and impaired microtubule nucleation. In dystrophin double-mutants, these defects were significantly aggravated. Moreover, we demonstrate that also in non-myogenic cells, all four MD-related proteins localize to the centrosome, including themuscle-specific full-length dystrophin isoform. Therefore, MD-related proteins might share a convergent function at the centrosome in addition to their diverse, wellestablished muscle-specific functions. Thus, our findings support the notion that cancer-like centrosome-related defects underlie MDs and establish a novel concept linking MDs to cancer.\nDOI 10.26508/lsa.202201367 | Received 10 January 2022 | Revised 21 June 2022 | Accepted 22 June 2022 | Published online 5 July 2022"

            "text": "Muscular dystrophies (MDs) comprise a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Although genetically heterogeneous, MDs share a common pathology, characterized by cycles of de- and regeneration of muscle fibers and progressive proliferation of connective tissue and fat cells. More recently, however, there is increasing evidence that aberrant expression of MD-related proteins is implicated in the development and/or progression of various types of cancer in humans and mice.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common MD of childhood, is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations disrupting the dystrophin (DMD) gene, resulting in the absence or vast reduction of the muscle-specific full-length dystrophin protein (Dp427; Hoffman et al, 1987). Emerging evidence suggests that\ndystrophin also plays a role as a tumor suppressor (TS) and antimetastatic factor (recently reviewed in Jones et al [2021]). Recently, recurrent somatic DMD deletions have been shown to drive development of aggressive sarcomas induced by fusion of immortalized myoblasts (Merle et al, 2020). Somatic DMD gene mutations and/or defective dystrophin expression has been found in various types of cancer, including non-myogenic tumors in humans (Korner et al, 2007; Wang et al, 2014; Luce et al, 2017; Gallia et al, 2018; Juratli et al, 2018; Mauduit et al, 2019). Moreover, mice lacking the expression of full-length dystrophin (Dmdmdx) have been found be prone to spontaneously develop age-related muscle-derived malignant sarcomas (Chamberlain et al, 2007; Fernandez et al, 2010; Schmidt et al, 2011). Although seemingly arising from skeletal muscles, these tumors presented as \u201cmixed sarcomas\u201d: in addition to myogenic tumor cells, also, non-myogenic compartments presenting as fibro- and liposarcomas could be identified histologically (Schmidt et al, 2011). Thus, these findings corroborate the concept that dystrophin conveys its function as TS beyond the myogenic lineage.\nIn addition to dystrophin, several other MD-associated proteins have been implicated in tumorigenesis (Fanzani et al, 2013). Mutations in the human DYSF and CAPN3 genes are causative for autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) types R2 (Liu et al, 1998) and R1 (Richard et al, 1995). Two different Dysfdeficient mouse strains (SJL mutation on the C57BL/10 background and A/J) have been reported to spontaneously develop musclederived sarcomas, especially later in life (Schmidt et al, 2011; Sher et al, 2011). Likewise, Capn3-knockout mice are also susceptible to muscle-derived rhabdomyosarcomas (Schmidt et al, 2011). Significantly, the simultaneous loss of dystrophin and dysferlin (Schmidt et al, 2011; Hosur et al, 2012) or dystrophin and calpain-3 (Schmidt et al, 2011) leads to a drastically increased sarcoma propensity, which is compatible with an additive TS function of these MD-related proteins.\nUtrophin, the autosomal paralogue of dystrophin, is not causatively related to MDs per se but is known to be aberrantly regulated and expressed in dystrophin-deficient conditions in humans and corresponding animal models (Helliwell et al, 1992; Matsumura et al, 1992). In addition, dystrophin-deficient Dmdmdx mice additionally lacking utrophin show a dramatic aggravation of the MD\n1Neuromuscular Research Department, Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria 2Division for Laboratory Animal Science and Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Himberg, Austria\nCorrespondence: wolfgang.schmidt@meduniwien.ac.at; reginald.bittner@meduniwien.ac.at\n\u00a9 2022 Winter et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202201367 vol 5 | no 11 | e202201367 1 of 16\non 25 January, 2024life-science-alliance.org Downloaded from http://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202201367Published Online: 5 July, 2022 | Supp Info:\nMD-related proteins at the centrosome Winter et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202201367 vol 5 | no 11 | e202201367 2 of 16\nphenotype, leading to premature death, suggesting a cooperative interaction of both molecules (Grady et al, 1997; Deconinck et al, 1997b). Notably, it is also proposed as a TS candidate as the UTRN gene has been found to be mutated in human cancers, like breast cancers, neuroblastomas, and malignant melanomas and as overexpression of utrophin in breast cancer cells inhibits growth (Li et al, 2007).\nThe fact that each of the four proteins described above, dystrophin, utrophin, dysferlin, and calpain-3, are implicated in the pathobiology of hitherto unrelated conditions, that is, MDs and cancer, tempted us to speculate that there must be a unifying \u201cplayer\u201d on the cellular level. However, the functional basis underlying the proposed TS properties of MD-related proteins remained elusive so far. Because dysfunctional centrosomes are causatively involved in DNA damage and somatic aneuploidy, both of which are hallmarks of cancer and inMDs, where these changes are present in muscles already before dystrophic changes, we set out to directly address this hypothesis experimentally."

            "text": "Dystrophin is a constituent of the centrosome in myoblasts and non-myogenic cells\nTo test the hypothesis that dystrophin might play a role at the centrosome, we first investigated its subcellular localization in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts by immunocytochemistry (ICC). Most frequently, we observed two dot-like signals mostly located in close vicinity to the cell nucleus, thus reminiscent of centrosomes. We confirmed this by co-probing the myoblasts for two centrosomal marker proteins, which resulted in staining patterns characterized by widely overlapping immunosignals corresponding to dystrophin and \u03b3-tubulin (Figs 1A and B and S1A and B and Video 1; secondary antibody controls for ICC experiments are shown in Fig S1C) or centrin-1 (Fig S1D). Although several antibodies rose against different epitopes of dystrophin that stained the centrosome (Fig S1A and B), no dystrophin signals were obtained in myoblasts derived from Dmdmdx mice (Fig S2A). Evaluation of the spatial centrosomal organization of dystrophin revealed a clear co-distribution with \u03b3-tubulin (Figs 1B and S2B and C). Moreover, we found that centrosomal localization of dystrophin was maintained throughout the entire cell division cycle (Fig 1C). Thus, our findings established co-\nlocalization of dystrophin and the centrosome in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts. In a next step, we co-stainedmurine and human primary myoblasts for dystrophin and \u03b3-tubulin, respectively, and again detected a co-localization of these proteins at the centrosome (Fig 1D).\nTo address the question if dystrophin is a constituent of the centrosomal multi-protein complex, we isolated centrosomes from C2C12 myoblasts by density-gradient centrifugation. Probing the centrosome-enriched fractions for dystrophin expression by Western blotting (WB) gave rise to an immunoreactive band at the position of the full-length skeletal-muscle isoform Dp427m (Fig 1E) (Hoffman et al, 1987).\nBecause defective dystrophin expression has been implicated not only in myogenic but also non-myogenic cancers in mice and men (Schmidt et al, 2011; Wang et al, 2014), we hypothesized that the canonical full-length dystrophin isoform Dp427m might be a centrosome constituent also in cells other than muscle cells. Therefore, we probed murine (p53\u2212/\u2212) dermal and human (WI-38) lung fibroblasts as well as human carcinoma cells (HeLa, Hep G2) for dystrophin and \u03b3-tubulin expression. Also, in these cells, we observed a co-localization of respective immunosignals (Figs 1F and S3A and B). Using highly concentrated protein extracts from murine and human fibroblasts as well as from HeLa cells, we could detect a dystrophin-specific immunoreactive band byWB at 427 kDa (Figs 1G and H and S3C). To verify that Dp427m is a centrosomal constituent in non-muscle cells, we tested these cells for the expression of the canonical muscle promoter of dystrophin and indeed found it to be expressed on the RNA level (Fig 1I\u2013K). Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that the Dp427m is a centrosomal protein in myoblasts and also in cells not belonging to the myogenic lineage.\nUtrophin, dysferlin, and calpain-3 also localize to the centrosome in myoblasts and fibroblasts\nNext, we examined whether other MD-related proteins are also constituents of the centrosome. To this end, we performed ICC in C2C12 myoblasts to probe also for the subcellular localization of utrophin, dysferlin, and calpain-3, respectively. As for dystrophin, we consistently found a close association of dot-like immunosignals with \u03b3-tubulin for all three MD-related proteins in C2C12 cells (Fig 2A\u2013D and Video 2\u2013Video 4) and primary mouse myoblasts but not in myoblasts derived from mutant UtrnKO, DysfSJL,\nin centrosome-enriched fractions 4, 5, and 6, as evaluated by increased \u03b3-tubulin protein levels, also full-length dystrophin (arrowheads) was detected.

(I) Scheme illustrating the nested RT\u2013PCR strategy used to detect dystrophin transcripts starting from the dystrophin muscle promoter (muscle-specific exon 1) extending into exon 11. As full-length dystrophin (Dp427) isoforms start from individual promoters (cortical/brain, muscle, or Purkinje cell promoter) into unique first exons followed by a common exon 2 (Muntoni et al, 2003; Doorenweerd et al, 2017); this strategy enabled the specific detection of dystrophin transcripts expressed from the muscle-specific promoter only. Moreover, as shorter dystrophin isoforms usually lack the amino-terminal dystrophin amino acids, RT\u2013PCR products obtained by this strategy are likely to correspond to full-length Dp427m. (J) Representative results of nested RT\u2013PCR for mouse dystrophin. Note that for mouse fibroblasts, in addition to the expected 1,113-bp PCR product (arrowhead), a second band of 981 bp was observed (arrow), corresponding to a transcript lacking exon 9 (Reiss & Rininsland, 1994).

Note that for HeLa cells, in addition to the expected 1,024-bp PCR product (arrowhead), a second band of 895 bp was observed (arrow), corresponding to skipping of exon 9 (Reiss & Rininsland, 1994) in this cell line as well.

Moreover, also, these three MD proteins were localized to the centrosome throughout the entire cell division cycle (Fig S7).\nTo test if these proteins are also biochemically linked to the centrosome complex, we probed centrosome-enriched cellular fractions byWB. Antibodies against utrophin, dysferlin, and calpain3, respectively, gave rise to bands of apparent molecular weights, which were indicative for the full-length isoforms of the respective proteins (Fig 2E). The fact that defective expression of these proteins has been found in cancers of different tissue types prompted us to speculate that centrosomal expression of these proteins might not be confined to myogenic cells. Therefore, we next probed murine fibroblasts by double ICC for the respective proteins with \u03b3-tubulin and observed a centrosome-associated localization of utrophin, dysferlin, and calpain-3 (Fig 2F). Moreover, whenwe tested protein lysates prepared from murine and human fibroblasts by WB, we confirmed high-level expression of canonical full-length isoforms also in these cell types (Fig 2G and H).\nEven though all four MD proteins displayed close spatial association of dot-like immunosignals with \u03b3-tubulin in C2C12 cells, utrophin seemed to be more distally shifted, whereas dystrophin, dysferlin, and calpain-3 appeared to more clearly overlap with the maximum of centrosomal \u03b3-tubulin signal (Fig S8A). Likewise, statistical evaluation of the co-localization with \u03b3-tubulin-positive signals revealed ~90% overlap with dystrophin, dysferlin, and calpain-3 but only ~65% with utrophin (Fig S8B). In addition, the evaluation of the Pearson\u2019s and Mander\u2019s coefficients indicated that all four MD-related proteins studied herein clearly co-localized with the centrosome (Fig S8C and D).\nCentrosome amplification in human and murine MD myoblasts\nChromosomal instability and aneuploidy, which we have previously shown to affect skeletal muscle and cultured myoblasts from human MD patients (Schmidt et al, 2011), are known to be causatively related to centrosome amplification (Cosenza & Kramer, 2016). Thus, we next determined the numbers of centrosomes in primary myoblasts derived from MD patients. We detected significantly increased numbers of cells containing amplified centrosomes (~5% of DMD and ~7% of LGMDR2 myoblasts, respectively), as compared with less than 2% of myoblasts derived from healthy (control) individuals (Fig 3A\u2013D). Supernumerary centrosomes, as found in myoblasts derived from MD patients, often displayed immunosignals, which were suggestive for centrosome clustering (Fig 3A and B, see insets II-IV). Centrosome amplification was also found to occur at a significantly higher level in primary murine myoblasts derived from neonatal single-mutant (Dmdmdx, UtrnKO, DysfSJL, Capn3KO) MD mice as compared with wild type (WT). In myoblasts from double-mutant (Dmdmdx UtrnKO, Dmdmdx Capn3KO, Dmdmdx DysfSJL) mice, centrosome amplification was even more increased, highly suggestive of a negative additive effect (Fig 3E and F).\nAbnormal nuclear morphology in murine and human MD myoblasts\nBecause centrosome amplification also impairs the integrity of the cell nucleus (Pihan, 2013), we counted nuclei displaying abnormal morphologies (i.e., occurrence of micronuclei, nuclear blebs, or multinucleated cells) in murine single- and double-mutant MD myoblasts. We detected a significantly increased number of nuclei displaying abnormal morphologies in UtrnKO and Capn3KO myoblasts as compared with WT cells. In all double-mutant MD myoblasts, these nuclear pathologies were even more pronounced (Fig 4A and B), whereas the analyses of other morphometric parameters of nuclei such as area, perimeter, circularity, or aspect ratio revealed no statistically significant differences (Fig S9A\u2013D). Likewise, we could frequently detect pronounced nuclear abnormalities such as altered shapes and reduced roundness, giant nuclei, nuclear blebbing, or micronuclei in human myoblasts derived from patients affected by DMD or LGMDR2, respectively (Fig 4C).\nImpaired centrosome reorientation and microtubule regrowth in"

Therefore, we functionally assessed these parameters in WT and MD myoblasts. Upon wounding, reorientation of the centrosomes was significantly disturbed in MD myoblasts (Fig 5A). Although ~75% of WT myoblasts displayed oriented centrosomes 2 h post-wounding, the proportion of cells with correctly positioned centrosomes was significantly decreased to ~60% in Dmdmdx, UtrnKO, and DysfSJL myoblasts and, again more pronounced, down to ~50% in all double-mutant MD myoblasts (Fig 5B). It had been shown that upon wounding, myoblasts position their centrosomes between the nucleus and the leading edge to obtain the required migratory front-rear polarity (Chang et al, 2015). Therefore, we evaluated whether the nuclear positioning in relationship with the centrosome localization was affected in MD myoblasts by measuring the distances from the centroid of the nucleus and from the centrosome relative to centroid of the cell (Chang et al, 2016). Although the positions of the nuclei were unaltered in MD myoblasts compared with WT cells, centrosomes were misaligned to a more rearward position in Dmdmdx, UtrnKO, Capn3KO single mutants and, even more pronounced, in all double-mutant MD myoblasts (Fig 5C).\nNext, we determined the microtubule-nucleating capacity of centrosomes in murine MD and WT myoblasts by disrupting microtubule assembly by nocodazole (Fig 6A). Microtubule outgrowth after nocodazole removal was significantly impaired in Dmdmdx, UtrnKO, and Capn3KO single mutants and, even more severe, in all double-mutant MD myoblasts reduced to ~40\u201350% of WT levels, indicating perturbed microtubule nucleation arising from centrosomes (Fig 6B and C).

            "text": "There is growing evidence that aberrant expression of dystrophin, utrophin, dysferlin, and calpain-3 does not only give rise to different forms of MDs but is also causatively related to tumorigenesis in humans and mice, which makes MD-related proteins TS candidates (Chamberlain et al, 2007; Korner et al, 2007; Li et al, 2007; Fernandez et al, 2010; Schmidt et al, 2011; Wang et al, 2014; Luce et al, 2017; Gallia et al, 2018; Juratli et al, 2018). Although case reports of cancer in MD patients are rare, growing evidence implicates all four MD genes and/or their protein products in tumorigenesis (Fanzani et al, 2013; Jones et al, 2021), likely by generating a permissive environment for tumor establishment. Especially for DMD gene mutations and/or expression changes, numerous reports highlight a clear role in the pathogenesis in a wide range of cancers, including sarcomas, carcinomas, melanomas, lymphomas, and leukemia, as well as brain tumors (Korner et al, 2007; Wang et al, 2014; Jones et al, 2021). To date, 13 DMD cases with cancer have been published, with a high incidence of rhabdomyosarcomas (six patients) being reported (Jones et al, 2021; Vita et al, 2021). In addition, reports of several patients with soft-tissue sarcomas indicate a role of the DMD gene and especially of intragenic deletions, in the development of this type of cancer (Wang et al, 2014; Jones et al, 2021). Moreover, reduced DYSF mRNA expression levels were found in pancreatic tumors, compared with healthy adjacent tissues, and intronic SNPs in the DYSF gene were associated with a higher risk of death (Tang et al, 2017). Interestingly, patients with renal-cell carcinoma and high DYSF gene expression levels presented with a better survival rate compared with renal-cell carcinoma patients with low DYSF expression (Ha et al, 2019). These results were, however, in contrast to another study, in which DYSF mRNA and protein expression levels were oppositely involved in tumor progression (Cox et al, 2020). CAPN3 expression was found to be reduced in human melanoma cell lines and biopsies, and its overexpression induced p53 stabilization and other effects, ultimately resulting in decreased cell proliferation (Moretti et al, 2009, 2015). Finally, Zhou et al recently showed that reduced UTRN expression levels in melanoma patients were associated with advanced clinical characteristics, including decreased survival and poorer prognosis (Zhou et al, 2021). In addition, up-regulated utrophin expression inhibited melanoma cell proliferation (Zhou et al, 2021). These clinical reports are in line with the observation that in MD mice, sarcomas share nonrandom genomic alterations including frequent loss of TS (such as Cdkn2a or Nf1), amplifications of oncogenes (Met, Jun), recurrent duplications of whole chromosomes 8 and 15, and DNA damage (Schmidt et al, 2011). However, the functional basis underlying the proposed TS properties of MD-related proteins\nremains elusive. Our finding that all four MD-related proteins investigated in this study show a centrosomal localization supports are in favor of a common pathomechanistic concept that essentially involves a common function at the centrosome. Therefore, one might hypothesize that also other proteins which are related to both MD and cancer could represent centrosomal proteins in addition to their known (muscle-related) function. To this end, we tested also \u03b1-sarcoglycan, as defective expression of which causes MD in humans (LGMDR3) and in mice and, in addition, confers cancer susceptibility in respective SgcaKO mice (Roberds et al, 1994; Fernandez et al, 2010). In line with our initial hypothesis that proteins related to both MD and cancer are components of the centrosome, we found that \u03b1-sarcoglycan also locates to the centrosome by ICC and by probing in centrosome-enriched fractions by WB (data not shown).\nAlthough we found all four MD proteins investigated herein associated with centrosomes in undifferentiated myoblasts, they are differentially expressed and localized during myogenic differentiation. Dystrophin and dysferlin are up-regulated and recruited to the myotube membrane (Belkin & Burridge, 1995) and to the T-tubule system (Klinge et al, 2007) in differentiating C2C12 cells, respectively, whereas utrophin is down-regulated during muscle fiber formation (Galvagni et al, 2002). When embryonic chick myogenic cells were differentiated into multinucleated myotubes, calpain-3 was found in a perinuclear organization, in adhesion structures, and in long-stress fiber-like structures (de Andrade Rosa et al, 2020). In their publication, de Andrade Rosa et al (2020) hypothesized that the perinuclear concentration of calpain-3 in chick muscle cells likely represents the presence of the scaffolding protein calpain-3 in centrosomes and suggest a possible role of calpain-3 in signaling pathways during myogenesis. Whether such an interaction in differentiated myotubes is also feasible for the other MD proteins remains to be investigated.\nOur finding that the centrosomal localization of MD-related proteins is not restricted to cells of the myogenic lineage is in line with the finding that defective expression of MD-related proteins is not only restricted to myogenic tumors but has also been shown to be related to different tissue types of non-myogenic cancers (Korner et al, 2007; Li et al, 2007; Schmidt et al, 2011; Fanzani et al, 2013; Wang et al, 2014; Luce et al, 2017; Gallia et al, 2018; Juratli et al, 2018; Jones et al, 2021). Remarkably, our finding that the MD proteins we investigated in this study are expressed in different suborganellar compartments of the centrosome support the notion that they are engaged in different functional pathways with respect to centrosome-related functions, which has to be tested in further experiments. We show here that the absence of MD-related proteins leads to centrosome amplification in murine and human myoblasts, which is consistent with the findings of Dumont et al (2015), who found centrosome amplification in dystrophin-deficient muscle stem cells (satellite cells, SCs; Dumont et al, 2015). Moreover, they showed that in SCs, dystrophin contributes to SC polarity and asymmetric division via association with Mark-2, an important regulator of cell polarity (Dumont et al, 2015).

In another study, it has been shown that the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor through Aurora kinase A (Aurka) regulates orientation of centrosomes during asymmetric SC division (Wang et al, 2019). Ultimately, in vivo EGF treatment in Dmdmdx mice rescued the reduction of asymmetric divisions in dystrophin-deficient SCs and resulted in increased numbers of progenitors and enhanced regeneration, thus restoring muscle strength (Wang et al, 2019). Whether this signaling pathway also plays a role in SCs from other MD mouse models, such as UtrnKO, DysfSJL, or Capn3KO, remains to be investigated.\nMultiple centrosome abnormalities represent a hallmark of virtually all cancer types and have been linked to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis (Cosenza & Kramer, 2016). In vitro, supernumerary centrosomes have been shown to promote chromosome mis-segregation during cell division (Ganem et al, 2009) and favor invasive phenotypes in a 3D-culturemodel (Godinho et al, 2014). Moreover, the presence of supernumerary centrosomes per\nse seems to be sufficient to drive aneuploidy and the development of various kinds of spontaneous tumors, including sarcomas (Levine et al, 2017). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the centrosome amplification that we have observed in human and murine MD myoblasts might be causatively implicated in genomic instability and DNA damage, which we have previously found in dystrophic muscle of MD mice and in muscles and myoblasts of human MD patients (Schmidt et al, 2011). Moreover, the acquisition of supernumerary centrosomes and the generation of multipolar spindles during mitosis likely facilitate unequal chromatin segregation during cell division (Nigg, 2002; Raff & Basto, 2017), which might ultimately lead to nuclear abnormalities. In line with this concept, we observed that human and murine myoblasts lacking the expression of the proteins studied in this study are frequently multinucleated and display numerous nuclear abnormalities such as micronuclei and nuclear blebs. Moreover, centrosome amplification and nuclear abnormalities were even more increased in myoblasts from double-mutant Dmdmdx UtrnKO, Dmdmdx Capn3KO, or Dmdmdx DysfSJL mice, highly suggestive of a negative additive effect of MD protein deficiencies with respect to these abnormalities. In general, mispositioning of myonuclei is a common feature of many MDs, and there is increasing evidence that mispositioned\nMD-related proteins at the centrosome Winter et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202201367 vol 5 | no 11 | e202201367 9 of 16\nmyonuclei are not merely a symptom but also drivers of dystrophic changes in MDs (Folker & Baylies, 2013). Moreover, nuclear positioning is closely associated with centrosome orientation in myoblasts and has important pathomechanistic consequences during directional cell migration as it is pivotal for establishing cell polarity (Chang et al, 2015).\nOur findings suggested that loss of MD-related proteins can impede adequate reorientation and rearward positioning of centrosomes during migration, whereas proper nuclear positioning\nwas unaffected. Also in this context, we provide evidence that MDrelated proteins act cooperatively by demonstrating that doublemutant MD myoblasts display a significantly lower fraction of cells with properly orientated centrosomes as compared with singlemutant cells. We also show that MD-related proteins are involved in conferring timely and proper microtubule nucleation because MD myoblasts display aberrant and impaired regrowth of microtubules in a respective assay. Also with respect to this phenotype, cooperativity of the MD-related proteins is suggested because the\nMD-related proteins at the centrosome Winter et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202201367 vol 5 | no 11 | e202201367 10 of 16\noutgrowth was dramatically hampered in double-mutant myoblasts as compared with single mutants. Our findings that MDrelated proteins are implicated in two dynamic centrosome-related processes, that is, migration-dependent centrosome reorientation and, in addition, conferring orchestrated microtubule outgrowth, indicates a functional role of these proteins in centrosome biology in more general. However, it should be noted that our data derived from nocodazole treatment experiments cannot discriminate between defective nucleation and outgrowth dynamics, representing an important limitation of this study, which needs to be addressed in future work. At least dystrophin behaves like a microtubuleassociated protein by interacting with microtubules in skeletalmuscle cells (Prins et al, 2009). Dysferlin also interacts with \u03b1-tubulin and microtubules (Azakir et al, 2010), preventing microtubule depolymerization by controlling the levels of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation in myoblasts (Di Fulvio et al, 2011). Contrary to dystrophin, which binds to microtubules with high affinity and pauses microtubule polymerization, utrophin has been shown to be inactive in microtubule binding assays and rescue experiments (Belanto et al, 2014). Moreover, even though no interaction between calpain-3 and tubulin has been reported so far, calpain-3 was reported to act as a modulator of the dysferlin protein complex (Huang et al, 2008) and could probably thereby influence the cytoskeleton. Although microtubules and their associated proteins and motors mediate most of the nuclear movements studied to date (Luxton et al, 2011; Luxton & Gundersen, 2011), it has been shown that nuclear movement and positioning as well as centrosome orientation in migrating myoblasts also require the actin cytoskeleton and its associated factors (Chang et al, 2015). Indeed, \u03b3-actin is also implicated in regulating centrosome function and mitotic progression in cancer cells (Po\u2019uha & Kavallaris, 2015) and therefore represents another candidate for interaction with MD proteins. In most cellular contexts, the actin network and the microtubules are intimately connected and often co-regulated, making it difficult to discern the specific effects of either network (Rodriguez et al, 2003). As all four MD-related proteins studied herein interact with the cytoskeleton in various ways, it might be anticipated that additional pathways contribute to the observed pathologic phenotypes.\nEven though we present a hitherto unreported centrosomal localization of several MD proteins together with a pathological phenotype in MD protein-lacking cells, the causative pathomechanism interlinking cancerogenesis and muscle damage has not yet been identified. First, insights gained by centrosome reorientation and microtubule nucleation experiments open a perspective for a possible function, but more in-depth studies will be needed to answer these questions. Strikingly, all centrosome-related pathologies which we show here, namely, the occurrence of supernumerary centrosomes, nuclear abnormalities, impaired orientation, and microtubule re-polymerization, were markedly aggravated in double-mutant MD myoblasts. This additive effect on the cellular level thus could explain why combined defects in MD genes provoked dramatically increased frequency and the earlier onset of sarcoma formation in Dmdmdx, DysfSJL (Schmidt et al, 2011), Dmdmdx-5Cv Dysfprmd (Hosur et al, 2012), and Dmdmdx Capn3KO (Schmidt et al, 2011) double-mutant MD mice.\nUp to now, lack of utrophin was not linked to any severe phenotype in respective knockout mice. In humans, however, defective expression of utrophin because of UTRN mutations has been detected in various types of human tumors, such as breast cancers, neuroblastomas, and malignant melanomas (Li et al, 2007). Here, we describe for the first time that the absence of utrophin gives rise to centrosome-related phenotypes on the cellular level, some of which were even more pronounced as compared with MD myoblasts deficient for dystrophin, dysferlin, or calpain-3. Noteworthy, the combined loss of utrophin and dystrophin gives rise to a markedly aggravated centrosome-related phenotype, suggesting an additive interaction of both proteins on the cellular level (Schmidt et al, 2011). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that this might reflect the underlying pathomechanism responsible for the aggravation of the MD-related phenotype in double-mutant (Dmdmdx UtrnKO) MD mice (Deconinck et al, 1997b).\nIn conclusion, we identified for the first time a centrosomal localization of four different MD-related proteins, dystrophin, utrophin, dysferlin, and calpain-3, in myoblasts and non-muscle cells and show that their absence leads to extra centrosomes, impaired centrosome function, and abnormal nuclear morphology. Therefore, we introduce a novel pathomechanistic concept that will foreseeably help to better understand the emerging link between MDs and cancer."

RNA (200 ng) was reversetranscribed using specific priming with an antisense oligonucleotide targeting exon 12 of dystrophin (primer sequence [59->39] for mouse Dmd was GGC TCT TCC TCC ATT TTC TTA GTT and for human DMD GTT GTA CTT GGC GTT TTA GGT CTT) in a 20 \u03bcl reaction containing 1 \u03bcM primer, 4 \u03bcl 5\u00d7 first strand reaction buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.5 mM dNTPs, 10 mM DTT, and 50 U Superscript II (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA synthesis was performed for 60 min at 42\u00b0C and terminated by incubation at 70\u00b0C for 10 min. Amplification was obtained by two rounds of PCR (using the GoTaq DNA Polymerase protocol; Promega) using the following primer pairs (0.5 \u03bcM each): first round PCR included primers complementary to the sequences of 59UTR and exon 11 (mouse Dmd gene: m59UTR, GTT TAT TGG CTT CTC ATC GTA CCT; mEx11rev, CTT CTG ATA ATT TCC CTT TTC CAA; human DMD gene: h59UTR, TGC TGA AGT TTG TTG GTT TCT CAT; hEx11rev, ATT TTC CTG TTC CAA TCA GCT TAC). After cycling (3min 95\u00b0C, 6\u00d7 [40 s 95\u00b0C, 40 s 60\u00b0C, 90 s 72\u00b0C], 32\u00d7 [30 s 95\u00b0C, 30 s 60\u00b0C, 90 s 72\u00b0C], 5min 72\u00b0C), 1 \u03bcl of a 1:100 dilution of first-round PCR reaction products were used as the template for nested PCR. Second-round primers were designed complementary to exons 1 and 10 of the dystrophin gene (mouse Dmd gene: mEx1for, GGT GGG AAG AAG TAG AGG ACT GT; mEx10rev, CAT CAT TTG AAA TCT CTC CTT GTG; human DMD gene: hEx1for, GCT TTG GTG GGA AGA AGT AGA GGA CTG T; hEx10rev, GTC CAG GTT TAC TTC ACT CTC CAT). PCR products were separated in Midori Green-stained agarose gels, excised, and purified with the illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare). Capillary DNA sequencing was performed at Eurofins Genomics, Austria."

            "text": "Centrosomes were isolated from confluent C2C12 cells essentially as reported (Gogendeau et al, 2015). Cells were scraped off in growth medium and treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml nocodazole and 2 \u03bcM cytochalasin D (both from Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C to depolymerize microtubules and actin filaments. After centrifugation at 280g for 8 min, cells were washed sequentially in 1\u00d7 TBS (Tris-buffered saline) and 0.1\u00d7 TBS/8% sucrose and then carefully lysed in 1 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.5% Igepal, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and Complete Inhibitor Cocktail tablets (Roche) for 5 min on ice. After centrifugation at 2,500g for 10 min, the lysis supernatant was filtered through a 40-\u03bcm nylon mesh and incubated with 20 U/ml DNase I (AppliChem) and 10mMHepes (pH 7.2) for 30min at 4\u00b0C. The lysate was underlaid with 60% sucrose solution (w/w) in gradient buffer (10 mM Pipes [pH 7.2], 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged at 10,400g for 30 min. The interface containing centrosomes and sucrose cushion was collected and further purified on a discontinuous (70, 50, and 40%) sucrose gradient by centrifugation at 120,000g for 1.5 h. For detection of\ndystrophin by WB analysis, fractions were concentrated three- to fourfold by using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (Merck Millipore)."

Primary mouse myoblasts were treated with 5 \u03bcM nocodazole in proliferation medium for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Afterward, cells were washed, incubated for 5min with fresh proliferation medium to allowmicrotubule regrowth, fixed with icecold methanol, and stained with \u03b1-tubulin antibodies for ICC. Analysis of microtubule regrowth was performed using ImageJ v1.52n by importing image stack files (*.oir) using the Bio-Formats Macro Extensions. After thresholding each channel (using the \u201cHuang dark stack\u201d method), the 3D Objects Counter function was used to automatically detect objects. Total size of green fluorescence objects were normalized to total size of DAPI objects for each image stack. Aster size was measured using ImageJ as well.\nQuantification and statistical analysis\nExperiments were performed at least in biological triplicates, unless otherwise stated. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM or median with minimum and maximum (whiskers). Statistical analysis was performed using Excel or GraphPad statistical software. Comparisons of categorical data between two groups were made using a two-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test. Comparisons among values of multiple groups were performed using one-way ANOVA. The significance between the individual groups was subsequently determined using the Tukey post hoc test (\u03b1 = 0.05).\nSupplementary Information\nSupplementary information is available at https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa. 202201367."
