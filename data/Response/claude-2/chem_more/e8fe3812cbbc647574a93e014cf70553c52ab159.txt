 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop new DNA origami structures for plasmonic biosensors, such as DNA cubes or tetrahedrons, to provide more functional arms and capabilities.

2. Combine multiple types of plasmonic biosensors, like SPR and SERS, onto a single DNA origami structure for multi-mode detection. 

3. Explore the use of different nanomaterials, like graphene or quantum dots, as the plasmonic substrate integrated with DNA nanostructures.

4. Design dynamic DNA origami structures that change conformation upon target binding to further enhance the plasmonic signal.

5. Apply the DNA origami-plasmonic biosensors for multiplexed detection of various disease biomarkers or contaminants within a single sample.
