These aqueous interfaces have been probed by heterodyne-detected sum-frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy. To obtain the molecular response from the measured HD-SFG spectra, one needs to correct the measured ssp spectra for local electromagnetic field effects at the interface due to a spatially varying dielectric function. This so-called Fresnel factor correction can change the inferred response substantially, and different ways of performing this correction lead to different conclusions about the interfacial water response. Here, we compare the simulated and experimental spectra at the air/water interface. We use three previously developed models to compare the experiment with theory: an advanced approach taking into account the detailed inhomogeneous interfacial dielectric profile and the Lorentz and slab models to approximate the interfacial dielectric function. Using the advanced model, we obtain an excellent quantitative agreement between theory and experiment, in both spectral shape and amplitude. Remarkably, we find that for the Fresnel factor correction of the ssp spectra, the Lorentz model for the interfacial dielectric function is equally accurate in the hydrogen (H)-bonded region of the response, while the slab model underestimates this response significantly. The Lorentz model, thus, provides a straightforward method to obtain the molecular response from the measured spectra of aqueous interfaces in the H-bonded region. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

The characteristic hydrogen-bond (H-bond) structure at the interface gives rise to several peculiar properties of liquid water. For example, at the air/water interface, a water molecule at the topmost layer evaporates by breaking its H-bond with other interfacial water molecules and following one specific molecular pathway.10 The interface constitutes a confined environment for molecules to generate incomplete solvation, potentially accelerating the chemical reaction compared to the bulk. As such, it is essential to probe the structure of interfacial water and understand the details of the interfacial H-bonding to reveal the underlying physics behind these phenomena. Heterodyne-detected sum-frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy has been used to probe the microscopic structure of a few topmost water layers.12 Among various polarization combinations of SFG, the ssp combination has often been used, because the measured data ((\u03c7 eff )ssp), which are affected by the interfacial dielectric function, can be connected with the second-order susceptibility (\u03c7 yyz ) of the yyz direction, which contains solely the molecular response, through the Fresnel factor correction.20 The Fresnel factors reflect the local electromagnetic field strength of the infrared, visible, and sum-frequency fields. Here, ssp denotes the s-, s-, and p-polarized SFG, visible, and infrared (IR) beams, while the xyand xz-planes are parallel to the surface and the plane of incidence, respectively. Although in the Fresnel factor correction, one needs to assume the interfacial dielectric profiles, the interfacial dielectric profiles are not known, resulting in a debate on the details of the \u03c7 yyz lineshape.21 For example, the Im(\u03c7 (2) eff )ssp spectrum at the air/water interface shows a positive 3700 cm feature and a negative 3400 cm feature, which arise from the free O\u2013H stretch and H-bonded O\u2013H stretch modes, respectively. This negative 3400 cm feature varies substantially, assuming different interfacial dielectric profiles. As such, it is essential to understand the interfacial dielectric profiles to accurately assess the Im\u03c7 yyz spectra. J. Chem.

By rigorously comparing the experimental and simulated spectra using the inhomogeneous interfacial dielectric profile model, we obtain a quantitative agreement between the simulated and experimental spectra. We explore the much simpler Lorentz and slab models to examine the accuracy of these homogeneous interfacial dielectric profile approximations.15 We conclude that the Lorentz model provides an adequately accurate model for the interfacial dielectric profile of water at any aqueous interface. For the HD-SFG measurements reported in this paper, we used an experimental setup that has been described previously.16 Briefly, a part of the power from a 1 kHz amplified femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser system was used to generate a narrowband visible pulse (\u223c14 cm) by a grating-based pulse shaper. The central wavelength of this visible pulse is 800 nm. The incident angles for all beams are 45 with respect to the surface normal. A phase modulator was placed before the sample to delay the LO pulse relative to visible (\u03c91) and infrared (\u03c92) pulses by \u223c2 ps. For the spectra simulation, we used the POLI2VS model of water. We used the classical molecular dynamics (MD) data of the trajectories, molecular dipole moments, and molecular polarizabilities obtained in Ref. 16 and computed the \u03c7 yyz spectra based on the time-correlation function of the dipole moment and polarizability.26 Various quantum correction schemes have been implemented for computing the spectra from the classical time-correlation function. Note that these schemes have been shown to be robust for the accurate force field model of water. Details of the experimental and simulation procedures are given in the supplementary material. The measured Im(\u03c7 eff )ssp and Re(\u03c7 (2) eff )ssp spectra at the air/water interface are displayed in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. These data are consistent with the previous reports. To compare the experimental (\u03c7 eff )ssp data and simulated \u03c7 (2) yyz data rigorously, one needs to consider that the interfacial dielectric profile is inhomogeneous within a few \u00c5 depth region; for example, the water molecules with one donor (D) and one acceptor (A) of the H-bonds (DA species) experience a different dielectric environment from those with two H-bond donors and two acceptors (DDAA species).16 FIG. 1.

Since these are not accessible in the experiment, we, thus, compared the \u03c7\u2032 yyz spectra between the experiment and simulation without considering the interfacial dielectric function. We obtained the \u03c7\u2032 yyz spectra experimentally using the following equation: \u03c7\u2032 yyz = (\u03c7 (2) eff )ssp/(Lyy(\u03c9)Lyy(\u03c91)L \u2032 zz(\u03c92) sin \u03b22), (1) where Laa(\u03c9i) is the aa-component of the Fresnel factor at frequency \u03c9i and \u03b22 denotes the incident angle of the IR beam. The Lzz(\u03c92) component contains the interfacial dielectric function (\u03b5(\u03c92)) in the denominator. To avoid the discussion of interfacial dielectric constant, we define Lzz(\u03c92) = \u03b5(\u03c92)Lzz(\u03c92) (see the supplementary material). Meanwhile, one can calculate \u03c7\u2032 yyz spectra from the simulations using the following equation: \u03c7\u2032 yyz =\u2211 i (\u03b5(\u03c92)) \u22121 \u03c7 yyz + (\u03b5 \u2032NR (\u03c92)) \u22121 \u03c7 yyz , (2) where the sum is over all types of hydrogen-bonded water species, with i representing the DA, DAA, DDA, and DDAA species. \u03b5 is the average interfacial dielectric function that species i experiences. The individual \u03b5 is given as \u03b5 = \u03b5(0.33 + 3.34/(3\u03b5 + 2)), \u03b5 = \u03b5(0.44 + 1.69/(1.6\u03b5 + 1.4)), \u03b5 = \u03b5(0.86 + 0.41/(1.1\u03b5 + 1.9)), and \u03b5 = \u03b5 = \u03b5, where NR represents non-resonant contribution. Note that we used the frequency-dependent \u03b5 obtained from Refs. 33 and 34. Furthermore, we set Re\u03c7 yyz = \u22124.8 \u00d7 10m/V and Im\u03c7 (2),NR yyz = 0.16 These heterogeneous interfacial dielectric profiles were optimized to reproduce the anisotropic nature of the interfacial dielectric function at the air/water interface,16 based on the bulk dielectric function.32 The simulated Im\u03c7 yyz and Re\u03c7 (2),i yyz spectra are shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), respectively. As expected, the positive free O\u2013H peak is governed by the DA and DAA water species, while all the water species contribute to the negative peak.35 Through Eqs. (1) and (2), we obtained the experimental and simulated Im\u03c7\u2032 yyz and Re\u03c7\u2032 yyz spectra, which are displayed in Figs. 1(e) and 1(f), respectively. The data show that the simulation quantitatively reproduces the \u03c7\u2032 yyz line shape, particularly the bonded O\u2013H stretch mode region. However, one can see the deviations in the 3150\u20133250 cm and 3500\u20133750 cm regions. The deviation in the 3150\u20133250 cm region arises from the insufficient description of the Fermi resonance (FR) within the classical MD simulation; because the FR arises from the mixing of the nuclear wave functions of the O\u2013H stretch vibration and H\u2013O\u2013H bending vibration, it cannot be fully captured in the classical MD simulation. Furthermore, the deviation in the 3500\u20133750 cm region arises from the enhanced 3600 cm shoulder peak in the simulation. This feature is also observed in the simulation data using the MB-pol model of water.29 We attribute this enhancement to the inability to account for nuclear quantum effects in the classical MD simulation. The simulation of the Im\u03c7\u2032 yyz spectra of water with a high frequency resolution, including nuclear quantum effects,39 is urgently needed. Above, we analyzed the data using the spatially inhomogeneous interfacial dielectric profile. However, such an analysis is possible only if we know the individual contributions of the different water species from the simulation, and even then, it is very labor-intensive. The question presents itself whether we can approximate the interfacial dielectric profile with one \u03b5, i.e., assuming a homogeneous interfacial dielectric profile. Can we infer the Im\u03c7 yyz spectra even approximately from the (\u03c7 eff )ssp spectra using an effective interfacial dielectric function within the three-layer model?13 Here, we would like to consider the two models of interfacial dielectric profiles: one is the Lorentz model, where the vibrational chromophores are fully solvated by water and, thus, \u03b5 = \u03b5.13 The other is the slab model, where the vibrational chromophores are semi-solvated and \u03b5 = \u03b5(\u03b5 + 5)/(4\u03b5 + 2).15 Because the interfacial dielectric profile critically affects the amplitude of the Im\u03c7 yyz peak, the accurately estimated amplitude of the simulated Im\u03c7 yyz peak can access the appropriate model of the interfacial dielectric function.16 Figures 2(a) and 2(b) display the experimental \u03c7 yyz spectra obtained using the Lorentz and slab models. Here, we also plotted the spectra that are the sum of the simulated \u03c7 yyz spectra and the estimated FR contribution (see the supplementary material). This FIG. 2. Comparison of the simulated and experimentally obtained (a) Im\u03c7 yyz and (b) Re\u03c7 yyz spectra. The Lorentz model (\u03b5\u2032 = \u03b5) and the slab model (\u03b5\u2032 = \u03b5 (\u03b5 + 5)/(4\u03b5 + 2)) are used for Fresnel",

In contrast, the slab model underestimates the amplitude of the negative 3100\u20133400 cm\u22121 feature significantly. Our result, thus, manifests that the Lorentz model is sufficiently accurate to obtain the \u03c7(2)yyz spectra of water. The fact that the free O\u2013H stretch signature, which is expected to be described by the slab model as the free O\u2013H chromophores are located at the topmost surface,16 can be well reproduced by the Lorentz model ensures the validity of the Lorentz model for the Fresnel factor correction of the (\u03c7(2)eff )ssp spectra of water not only at the air/water interface but also at various aqueous interfaces. We note that the Lorentz model is still insufficient for obtaining the Im\u03c7(2)zzz spectra, because the interfacial dielectric profile affects the (\u03c7(2)eff )ppp spectra in a much more complicated manner.16\nHistorically, the Im\u03c7(2)yyz spectra of water have often been inferred using the slab model.31,40\u201343 Our current finding questions this approach, because the slab model appears to underestimate the H-bonded O\u2013H stretch peak in the 3100\u20133400 cm\u22121 region significantly. This would lead to the conclusion of weaker hydrogen bonding at the interface than there is in reality. We further suspect that the obtained \u03c7(2)yyz spectra (or \u03c7\u2032 (2) yyz spectra with the interfacial dielectric profiles for different water species) can be used for the critical check of the simulated spectra.20,29,31,44\u201350 It is more robust if one can see the agreement on not only the spectral line shape but also the absolute amplitude of the spectra.16,51 Such an attempt is on the horizon.\nIn summary, by carrying out the HD-SFG measurement at the ssp polarization combination and SFG spectra simulation at the air/water interface using the inhomogeneous interfacial dielectric profile, we obtained a very good agreement between high-level simulations and the interfacial dielectric constant-uncorrected experimental Im\u03c7\u2032(2)yyz spectra. Our study further indicates that among the homogeneous interfacial dielectric constant models, the Lorentz model allows us to accurately convert the (\u03c7(2)eff )ssp spectra to the \u03c7 (2) yyz spectra, while the slab model underestimates the H-bonded O\u2013H stretch signal. As such, we strongly suggest processing the (\u03c7(2)eff )ssp data of water using the Lorentz model.\nSee the supplementary material for the details of the experiment, data processing, and simulation.\nWe thank Shoichi Yamaguchi and Shumei Sun for stimulating discussions.
