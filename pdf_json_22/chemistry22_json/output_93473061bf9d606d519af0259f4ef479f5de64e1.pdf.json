    "abstractText": "The current study reports synthesis, structure establishment, anti-glycation, and anti-oxidant activities of ligand 4-[(2-hydroxynaphthalene-1-ylmethylene)-amino]-benzenesulfonamide (L) and its coordination compounds with Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) metal ions. The analytical techniques used (UV-Vis, FT-IR, CHN/S) confirmed the bidentate nature of the ligand, coordinating via O and N atoms in 2:1 ligand-to-metal ratio. The TG/DTA anylsis displayed that these compounds are thermally stable. Furthermore, the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti-glycation and antioxidant potential and showed significant activities with IC50 values range 184.11\u2013386.34 \u03bcM and 37.05\u2013126.27 \u03bcM, respectively. The Mn (IC50 = 184.11 \u00b1 2.11 \u03bcM), Ni (IC50 = 211.26 \u00b1 1.46 \u03bcM), Cu (IC50 = 254.56 \u00b1 1.16 \u03bcM), and Zn (IC50 = 276.43 \u00b1 2.14 \u03bcM) metal complexes exhibited substantial anti-glycation activity and comparatively better activity than the standard rutin (IC50 = 294.4 \u00b1 1.50 \u03bcM), whereas Zn complex (IC50 = 37.05 \u00b1 1.53 \u03bcM) also showed better DPPH radical scavenging activity than the standard tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (IC50 = 44.7 \u00b1 1.21 \u03bcM).",

The group of ten elements (i.e. V, Cr, Fe, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, Mo, Zn, and Cd) form many complexes with various biomolecules to execute different biological functions.1,2 These metal complexes are required for our bodies in very small quantities, but their excess or deficiency can cause many serious diseases.3,4 The clinical and commercial importance of metal complexes as medicinal drugs is increasing day by day for the treatment of various diseases.5,6 The synthesis of metal complexes as chemotherapeutic agents in clinical application has shown significant progress in medicinal chemistry to fight against several human diseases, such as to treat different types of cancers, tumors, diabetes mellitus, anti-inflammation, possessing antifungal activity and acting against a wide range of bacterial diseases.7\u20139 Recently, the metal complexes of transition elements have shown great importance in materials synthesis, catalysis and photo-\nchemistry.10,11 The platinum metal complexes including cisplatin, carboplatin and nedaplatin are widely used drugs for cancer chemotherapy.12 Copper(II), zinc(II), vanadium(V) and oxidovanadium(V) metal complexes have been reported for their excellent antibacterial urease enzyme inhibition and catalytic properties.13\u201317 According to the literature, sulfonamides have a variety of bioactivities, including antitumor, antimalarial, antimicrobial, antithyroid, antidiabetic, anti-HIV/AIDS, anti-parasitic, antiepileptic, and dihydropteroate synthetase inhibitors activities.18\u201321 Sulfonamide metal chelates derivatives have also been reported for their anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-HIV, anticancer, anticarbonic anhydrase, diuretic, hypoglycemic, antithyroid, antimalarial, antitumor, anti-angiogenic, anti-tubercular, antibacterial, and antifungal activities.22\u201325 Moreover, gold sulfonamide chelates were also found to have applications for the treatment of skin disorders and rheumatoid arthritis.26\nYaqoob et al.: Synthesis, Characterization, Anti-Glycation, and ...\nSchiff bases are widely studied compounds due to their structural resemblance with the natural bioactive molecules and ease of synthesis of diverse structures.27,28 The importance of Schiff base complexes in supramolecular chemistry, catalysis and material science, separation and encapsulation processes, biomedical applications and formation of compounds with unusual properties and structures has been well recognized and reviewed.29\u201331 Sulfonamides Schiff base complexes with cobalt(II), copper(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II) have shown significant in vitro antibacterial, antifungal, and cytotoxic properties. The N,N-chelating half-sandwich ruthenium(II) para-cymene complexes containing sulfonamide moieties also showed a broad range of therapeutic applications, which include the inhibition of various isoforms of carbonic anhydrases (CAs).32 Glycation is a reaction of blood sugar with the proteins like collagen; when this reaction occurs in a great extent advanced glycation products (AGEs) are formed which may further degrade protein and cause oxidative stress that damage cell membranes and produce diabetic complications such as neuropathy and diabetes retinopathy which further increase the rate of the aging processes. Oxidative stress is the main aspect of all living systems which occurs due to the excess of free radicals. Due to oxidative stress, biochemical energy is converted into adenosine triphosphate with the help of oxygen, this biochemical reaction generates reactive oxygenated species (ROS). These ROS can damage lipids, proteins, and DNA by oxidation and cause many diseases such as cancer, brain disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, obesity, aging, diabetes and skin disease.33 Antioxidant compounds are used as health-protecting factors in food playing an important role in preventing many diseases. The antioxidant compounds obtained from plants such as carotenes, phenolic acids, vitamin C and E, phytate, and phytoestrogens were found to be very helpful in decreasing the risks of many diseases. A number of synthetic compounds have also been reported having remarkable anti-oxidant properties.34 The cosmetic and food industries are funded by several companies to promote the research of the synthesis of glycation-inhibiting ingredients and anti-oxidants in order to discover new anti-aging compounds for keeping skin youthful for a prolonged period. The latest research focuses on finding the ways for the inhibition of AGEs formation, and on reducing oxidative stress with the objective\nof promoting health by treating degenerative changes and mitigating the effect of lifestyle-related diseases.35 Earlier, we have reported anti-glycation and anti-oxidant properties of isatin containing hydrazide Schiff base metal complexes.36 In the continuation of exploring metal complexes for bioactivities, herein we have synthesized 4-[(2-hydroxynaphthalen-1-ylmethylene)amino]benzenesulfonamide Schiff base ligand (L) and its metal (Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) complexes for the evaluation of anti-glycation and anti-oxidant activities."

The IR spectrum of the ligand showed strong absorption bands at 1622 and 3290 cm\u20131, which were attributed to the characteristic\nband of the \u03bd(-C=N-) and \u03bd(-OH) or -NH groups respectively. The sharp bands observed at 1347 cm\u20131 are due to -S=O stretching vibration. FT-IR spectral calculation revealed that for the ligand, which may act as a bidentate according to its structure, is expected that FT-IR measurements will be highly indicative with respect to the complexation behavior with various metal ions. Peaks in 3400 to 3500 cm\u20131 region support the observation of water molecules participating in the complex formation; this being further confirmed by CHN/S and thermogravimetric data. In the case of metal complexes, the peaks for azomethine group (-C=N-) were shifted from 1622 cm\u20131 to 1615, 1612, 1610, 1609, 1608 cm\u20131 and hydroxy group (\u2013OH) peaks were shifted from 3290 cm\u20131 to 3278, 3260, 3248, 3240, 3237 cm\u20131 for Mn(L)2, Co(L)2, Ni(L)2, Cu(L)2 and Zn(L)2 complexes, respectively.

DTA thermogram showed one exothermic peak at 328 \u00b0C, while two endothermic peaks appeared at 69.42 \u00b0C and 270 \u00b0C, these may be due to some physical or chemical change phenomenon occurring during weight loss, such as melting, phase change, chemisorptions etc. The TGA of Mn(L)2 complex showed thermal decomposition in three stages.

It is reported in the literature that copper can form the octahedral coordinated metal complexes such as [Cu(Hmbm)2(OAc)2], which was reported as an octrahedral complex. Hmbm is bonded to the Cu(II) ion in a chelating mode through its nitrogen and oxygen atoms, and two carboxylic oxygen atoms complete the octahedral coordi-\nnation. The coordination of a water molecule was confirmed by FT-IR and XRD data.40 For the same cause, the synthesized complexes have the octahedral geometry."

They showed excellent anti-glycation activity. The ligand (IC50 = 265.11 \u00b1 1.86 \u03bcM) and its metal chelates including Mn(L)2 (IC50 = 184.11 \u00b1 2.11 \u03bcM), Zn(L)2 (IC50 = 211.26 \u00b1 2.14 \u03bcM), Ni(L)2 (IC50 = 254.56 \u00b1 1.73 \u03bcM), Cu(L)2 (IC50 = 276.43 \u00b1 1.16 \u03bcM) showed outstanding anti-glycation activity, whereas, Co(L)2 (IC50 = 386.34 \u00b1 1.46 \u03bcM) was observed as a weak anti-glycating agent. Among them, Mn(L)2 complex showed the highest activity and it was found to be many fold more active than the standard rutin. However, Zn(L)2, Ni(L)2, and Cu(L)2 are comparatively less active than Mn(L)2 complex, although they were also found to have better activities than the standard. The activity pattern of these complexes can therefore be depicted as: Mn(L)2 > Zn(L)2 > Ni(L)2 > Cu(L)2 > Co(L)2 (see Supp. data S.21\u2013S.24). It was found that these chelates have capability to interact with proteins or glucose in a great extent and can obstruct the advancement of glycation. The active compounds may insert into hydrophobic cavities of BSA followed by the inhibition of advance glycation. Mn(L)2 has elevated level of insertion into the slots of BSA protein."

However, further studies on the mechanisms of antioxidation and anti-glycation are required."

Uporabljene analizne tehnike (UV-Vis, FT-IR, CHN/S) so potrdile bidentatno naravo liganda, ki se koordinira preko O in N atomov v razmerju liganda proti kovini 2:1. TG/DTA analiza je pokazala, da so te spojine termi\u010dno stabilne.
