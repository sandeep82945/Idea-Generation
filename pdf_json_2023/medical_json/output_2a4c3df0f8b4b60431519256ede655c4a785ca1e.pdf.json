    "abstractText": "Background. This study measured fluoride release from a light-cured orthodontic adhesive resin (Vega type) at three time intervals (one day, one week, and one month), investigated the rechargeability of the resin, and assessed its impact on shear bond strength in demineralized tooth surfaces. Methods. This study used 30 recently extracted upper premolar teeth to explore the effects of fluoride release over specific time intervals. The teeth underwent demineralization and were categorized into groups based on time intervals: one day, one week, and one month. Subgroups within each interval underwent fluoride recharging through fluoride varnish application. Fluoride release and shear bond strength were assessed after etching with phosphoric acid gel, applying the orthodontic adhesive, and curing. The samples were stored in deionized water. Fluoride quantification used a selective electrode, while shear bond strength assessment employed a universal testing machine. Finally, statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS 22. Results. The study found that after one month, the adhesive had the highest fluoride release and shear bond strength mean values. There were significant differences in fluoride release and shear bond strength between the various groups studied. Conclusion. The application of fluoride varnish around the orthodontic bracket resulted in a positive effect on the shear bond strength of the bracket.

            "text": "Among the diverse array of orthodontic interventions, multi-bracket treatment persists as the preeminent modality extensively employed within the realm of orthodontic applications. While it offers several distinct advantages, it is not devoid of inherent risks, the most encountered being bracket detachment or the onset of gingival inflammation. Furthermore, this treatment approach renders patients more susceptible to caries, decalcification, and enamel demineralization, accentuating the importance of comprehensive and meticulous oral care during treatment.1\nThe occurrence of enamel demineralization, commonly referred to as white spot lesions (WSLs), represents a formidable risk factor intrinsic to orthodontic treatment. Particularly noteworthy is the heightened susceptibility observed in cases where oral hygiene is compromised, accompanied by protracted plaque accumulation in the vicinity of brackets. Given this context, safeguarding the integrity of the enamel surface poses a formidable challenge for orthodontic practitioners, necessitating their unwavering commitment to meticulous preventive\nmeasures and diligent patient education.2 Enamel demineralization, manifesting as WSLs, signifies the incipient stage of carious lesion formation. Consequently, the effective prevention of WSL occurrence has emerged as a highly prominent research area. Notably, scientific literature has reported that approximately onethird of WSLs can be arrested before progressing into overt caries. As a result, the utilization of agents with caries-preventive properties or those capable of halting primary lesions is strongly recommended for orthodontic patients.3,4\nThe main approach for preventing the formation of WSLs lies in patient education and fostering motivation concerning oral hygiene practices. Additionally, various other methods have proven effective in this endeavor, including fluoride gels, varnishes, toothpaste, and mouth rinses. Moreover, incorporating fluoride into orthodontic adhesives has emerged as a widely adopted technique in combating WSLs.2\nFluoride-releasing materials can absorb fluoride ions from the oral environment, replenishing the lost fluoride content. This phenomenon, known as fluoride recharge,\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Bracket detachment constitutes a matter of considerable gravity, particularly in select clinical contexts, given its capacity to exert a substantial influence on the overarching efficacy of treatment regimens and their temporal dimensions. Scholarly literature has meticulously chronicled notable instances of bracket detachment, mandating comprehensive scrutiny owing to its conceivable ramifications for the ultimate outcomes of orthodontic interventions.1\nThe success of bracket bonding in orthodontic treatment relies on achieving shear bond strengths (SBS) within a range of 4\u201210 MPa. This range ensures that the bonded brackets can withstand the orthodontic forces and masticatory pressures encountered during treatment. SBS values < 4 MPa may lead to bracket detachment, compromising treatment outcomes, while values exceeding 10 MPa can pose challenges during bracket removal. Striking a balance within this SBS range allows for effective force transmission, controlled tooth movement, and overall treatment success. Thus, meticulous attention is given to bonding protocols to attain optimal SBS values, ensuring both the stability of brackets during treatment and their safe removal at the end of treatment.6\nThe influence of fluoride application on the bond strength is a subject of investigation. Emerging research indicates that the temporal aspect of fluoride application, whether preceding or succeeding bracket placement, holds significance in determining its impact on bonding strength.7,8"

The solution was adjusted to a pH of 4.4 using 1-M KOH using a Eutech 700 pH Meter. Submersion took place at a temperature of 37\u00b0C for 96 hours.

The tooth samples were then secured onto the stone surface using soft, sticky wax to center them within the plastic ring and position them perpendicular to the base. The sample assembly was placed on a glass slab attached to a dental surveyor to maintain consistency and alignment. The long axis of each tooth was aligned parallel to the analyzing rod of the surveyor, replicating the direction of force application during the SBS test.11\nFinally, the PVC rings were filled with autopolymerizing cold-cured acrylic resin until it reached the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) level to stabilize and secure the tooth samples for accurate analysis and testing."

The buccal surface of each tooth was\nJ Dent Res Dent Clin Dent Prospects, 2023, Volume 17, Issue 3144\nthen etched with a 37% phosphoric acid gel for 30 seconds, followed by rinsing and drying. The entire sample assembly was positioned on an articulator with a prefabricated base for stability and alignment. Subsequently, stainlesssteel metallic brackets of the standard edgewise type (Dentaurum, Ispringen, Germany), were securely held using clamping tweezers, and Vega Ortho UV light-cured orthodontic adhesive resin (DFL, Brazil) was evenly applied to the bracket\u2019s base. Careful positioning of the bracket at the center of the buccal surface of the premolar tooth, maintaining a 4-mm distance from the occlusal surface, was ensured using the Boon\u2019s gauge as a guide for accurate placement.\nA standardized load of 200 gm was applied perpendicular to the bracket slot on the articulator arm, as seen in Figure 2, to ensure uniform resin thickness without air voids.12 The excess resin was removed, and curing was performed using an LED light-curing device with a wavelength range of 385\u2012515 nm and an illumination intensity of 1200\u20121500 MW/cm2. The curing light was calibrated for every 5 samples using a radiometer. The curing process involved 20 seconds of light exposure on the mesial and distal sides of the bracket, with the tip positioned 2 mm away from each edge.13 Finally, the specimens were placed in a container with 5 mL of deionized water."

Total solubilized fluoride was determined using a fluorideselective electrode, with readings (in mV) recorded once stabilization occurred, as shown in Figure 3. To ensure\naccuracy, the electrode was pre-calibrated using a series of fluoride calibration solutions, creating a calibration curve that facilitated the conversion of millivolt readings to fluoride concentrations expressed in parts per million (ppm). This process allowed precise quantification of fluoride levels in the samples and enabled meaningful conclusions about their fluoride content.\nMeasuring shear bond strength The SBS test was performed at the Operative Department laboratories in the College of Dentistry, Mosul University, utilizing a universal testing machine (Gester, China) with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. A knife edge blade was positioned to exert force on the tooth-bracket interface in an occlusogingival direction. The necessary load to debond or initiate bracket failure was recorded in Newton units and then converted to megapascals (MPa) by dividing the failure load into Newton units by the standardized base surface area of the brackets, which was 10.03 mm2 in this study as per the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. The steps were repeated using newly extracted teeth with fluoridated adhesive to measure fluoride release and recharging at different time intervals. Fluoride release was quantified with a fluoride-selective electrode, and SBS was assessed using a universal testing machine."

This pertinence arises from the noteworthy incidence rates of WSLs, ranging from 30% to 70%, documented during fixed orthodontic interventions.3\nFluoride-releasing orthodontic adhesives represent a viable approach in the potential mitigation of WSLs.15\nIntegrating fluoride into orthodontic adhesives presents a practical dilemma concerning fluoride application. Ensuring a sustained supply of fluoride to the enamel surface remains critical even after the composite has fully released its fluoride content. Consequently, recharging the adhesive with sodium fluoride becomes essential to augment the availability of fluoride ions within the medium over a designated timeframe.\nThe primary objective of this study was to evaluate the fluoride release characteristics of Vega Ortho UV lightcured orthodontic adhesive at different time intervals and investigate its rechargeability by employing fluoride varnish. Additionally, the study sought to address the uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of these procedures on the SBS of brackets. To achieve this, the investigation involved the assessment of SBS at various time points both before and after the recharge process. Furthermore, the study involved the creation of artificially demineralized lesions on the buccal tooth surface (position of the bracket) to examine the effects of fluoride from adhesive and fluoride varnish on SBS in demineralized tooth surfaces. The research was motivated by the significant clinical concern in orthodontics regarding WSLs observed in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances due to plaque accumulation around orthodontic brackets, necessitating a focused approach on demineralized teeth to address this issue.\nAcross many investigations, the SBS exhibited by brackets on intact enamel surfaces was notably higher than the corresponding SBS values observed on demineralized enamel surfaces.7,16,17\nNumerous studies have reported that the diminished SBS of brackets on demineralized enamel can be attributed to the presence of atypical enamel surfaces and the absence of resin tag formation. These factors are pivotal in establishing micromechanical interlocking between the adhesive material and the enamel surface.18,19\nThe fluoride release pattern observed in the groups before recharge exhibited a notable surge in fluoride ion release on the initial day. This can be attributed to the fluoride ions in the adhesive that had not yet been absorbed by the tooth surface. Subsequently, there was a decline in fluoride ion release after one week, followed by a slight increment after one month. These findings coincide with the outcomes reported in prior studies.5,20\nThe second part of this study was to measure fluoride ion uptake and re-release from orthodontic adhesives after topical fluoride varnish application. This study showed that orthodontic adhesives could take up and re-release fluoride ions after exposure to topical fluoride. Among the after-recharge groups, the one-month group had the highest mean value, possibly because the adhesive released a large amount of fluoride with a large amount of reuptake during recharge, followed by a more significant release. Other groups distributed between these two groups showed a significant difference when compared to each other by the Duncan test.\nThe initial surge in fluoride ion release after the topical application of fluoride can likely be linked to the expulsion of fluoride ions retained on the surface or within the pores of the materials during the re-fluoridation process. These observations suggest that the adhesive under investigation can undergo recharging with fluorides introduced through fluoride application techniques.21\nThe initial rapid release of fluoride ions during the early days following adhesive application bears clinical significance due to its prompt formation of calcium fluoride on the enamel surface when exposed to the oral cavity environment. This occurrence may potentially play a protective role by promoting the remineralization of etched enamel. Moreover, the burst effect of fluoride ion release might confer certain advantageous biological properties, such as bactericidal and/or bacteriostatic effects, immediately after bracket placement. Despite being comparatively weaker in magnitude, even a sub-parts-per-million (sub-ppm) level of fluoride ion release can considerably influence the demineralization/ remineralization process, provided the release is sustained over time.20\nNonetheless, prior investigations have yielded varying and conflicting outcomes regarding the impact of fluoride application on SBS. Generally, fluoride pretreatment has been associated with lower SBS values, leading to a diminished bonding efficacy of orthodontic brackets. The topical application of fluoride has been found to interfere with the etching effect of phosphoric acid on enamel surfaces, consequently reducing the bond strength of orthodontic brackets.7,22-24\nThe present study revealed a positive correlation between fluoride release and SBS, as indicated in Table 4. The SBS values obtained in the month-after groups demonstrated the highest mean value, signifying the maximum benefit of fluoride ions in facilitating the remineralization of the enamel surface during this time frame. This was followed by the SBS values in the week-after group and then in the day-after group, respectively. These results differ from those reported in earlier research, where fluoride-treated groups exhibited lower SBS values. This discrepancy may be attributed to fluoride\u2019s capacity to react with the enamel surface, leading to calcium fluoride and fluorapatite formation, rendering the surface more resistant to demineralization.\nJ Dent Res Dent Clin Dent Prospects, 2023, Volume 17, Issue 3 147\nNotably, in those studies, fluoride application occurred before bracketing, potentially interfering with the etching effect of phosphoric acid on enamel surfaces and consequently reducing the bond strength of dental resin.18 In contrast, our investigation implemented fluoride varnish application after the bracketing procedure on demineralized tooth surfaces, which yielded a noteworthy enhancement in the SBS of the orthodontic attachments."
