1. **Investigate the effect of different anions on the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs.** The current study only looked at the effect of the cation on CO2 absorption. Future research could investigate how different anions, such as formate, acetate, and propionate, affect the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs. This information could be used to design APILs with even higher CO2 absorption capacities.


2. **Explore the use of APILs for CO2 capture from flue gas.** The current study only looked at the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs in pure CO2. Future research could investigate the use of APILs for CO2 capture from flue gas, which is a more realistic application. This research would need to address the challenges of using APILs in the presence of other gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen.


3. **Develop new methods for the synthesis of APILs.** The current methods for the synthesis of APILs are often time-consuming and expensive. Future research could develop new methods for the synthesis of APILs that are more efficient and cost-effective. This would make APILs more attractive for commercial applications.


4. **Investigate the long-term stability of APILs.** The current study only looked at the short-term stability of APILs. Future research could investigate the long-term stability of APILs, including their stability under different temperature and pressure conditions. This information is important for understanding the potential applications of APILs in CO2 capture and other industrial processes.


5. **Explore the use of APILs for other applications.** The current study only looked at the use of APILs for CO2 capture. Future research could explore the use of APILs for other applications, such as gas separation, catalysis, and energy storage. This research could lead to the development of new and innovative technologies that utilize APILs.
