For the metal oxide carbonyls, the MO(CO)5\n+ (M = Sc, Y, La and Ce) is similar to a pentagonal pyramidal structure with C5V symmetry.31 The maximum carbonyl-coordination number of ScO(CO)n\n+, YO(CO)n + and LaO(CO)n + is 6, 7 and 9, respectively.32\u201334 On the side of heterobinuclear transition metal oxide carbonyls, the sequential adsorption of CO in NbNiO(CO)5\u20138\n\u2212 and TaNiO(CO)4\u20138\n\u2212 clusters can promote the competitive binding with oxygen atom to the transition metal centers.35,36 Many researches focus on the oxidation of CO when studying the interaction between CO and transition metal oxide (TMO) since CO oxidation is one of the most important prototypical reactions.35\u201339 The TM atom acts as a preferred trapping site for CO adsorption and accepts the electron from CO. Then the ligand CO could be oxidized by the oxygen species on the TMO cluster.

Ni2TiO2(CO)n\n\u2212 (n = 2\u20134) clusters were fabricated by ablating a small Ti/Ni target (mole ratio, Ti/Ni = 1 : 1) with a laser vaporization (532 nm) beam in the presence of helium carrier gas seeded with 5% CO. Stagnation of the carrier gas was approximately 4 atm. Cluster anions expanded into the source chamber aer being cooled. Wiley\u2013McLaren time-of-ight mass spectrometer was used to mass select these anionic clusters. For the detachment of these anionic clusters, photon energy of 355 nm (3.496 eV) was employed. The photoelectrons were mapped onto a detector consisting of a micro-channel plate and a phosphor screen. The two-dimensional (2D) images on the phosphor screen were recorded by a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera. Each image was obtained by accumulating 10 000\u201350 000 laser shots at 10 Hz repetition rate. All of the raw images were reconstructed using the basis set expansion inverse Abel transform method (BASEX). The photoelectron spectra were calibrated using the known spectrum of Au\u2212.43\u201345 The PES were plotted against electron binding energy eBE = hn \u2212 eKE, where hn is the photon energy.

Ni2TiO2(CO)3 \u2212. In all the isomers of Ni2TiO2(CO)3 \u2212 clusters, most of the CO molecules adsorb to Ni atoms to form a terminal state or a bridging state between Ti and Ni or between two Ni atoms. The isomers with CO molecule bonding to Ti, such as 3d\u20133g, have higher energies. The ground state structure 3a with one bridging carbonyl and two terminal carbonyls is similar to 2a. The angle of Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ni in 3a is 175.60\u00b0. It is different from the ground state of TiNi(CO)3\n\u2212 with three different types of CO bonds9 due to the discrepancy between the number of Ni atoms and the presence of oxygen.\n3168 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 3164\u20133172\nThe meta-stable structure 3b, in which the three metal atoms have triangle conguration, is 0.32 eV higher in energy than 3a. The 3c isomer is 0.4 eV higher in energy than 3a though it has similar conguration to 3a with the bridging carbonyl being side-on-bonded instead.\nAccording to Table 1 and S3 of the ESI,\u2020 among the seven Ni2TiO2(CO)3\n\u2212 isomers, 3a, 3b, and 3c have both comparable VDE and ADE values to experimental ones. From Fig. 4 we can see that there are three peaks at 2.81, 2.88, and 3.1 eV in the simulated PES of 3a, which coincides with the experimental values (2.76 \u00b1 0.04, 2.86 \u00b1 0.03, 3.02 \u00b1 0.02 eV) well. However, the number of the peaks (four peaks centered at 2.71, 3, 3.16, and 3.3 eV) in the simulated PES of 3b is larger than that in experiment. For 3c, except for the rst peak at 2.73 eV in the simulated PES is comparable to the experimental result of 2.76 eV, the other two peaks at 3.19 and 3.32 eV cannot match the experimental values of 2.86 \u00b1 0.03 and 3.02 \u00b1 0.02 eV, respectively. This suggests that the 3a isomer should be responsible for the n = 3 spectrum.\n3.2.3. Ni2TiO2(CO)4 \u2212. With the increase in cluster size, the potential energy surface becomes more complicated and the number of isomers increases. There are 11 isomers for Ni2TiO2(CO)4\n\u2212 clusters. Most of the CO molecules adsorb to Ni atoms to form a terminal state or a bridging state between Ti and Ni or between two Ni atoms. The ground state structure 4a with C2 symmetry is similar to 2a and 3a. The angle of Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ni in 4a is 171.10\u00b0.

It can be seen from Tables 1 and S3 of the ESI\u2020 that the VDE (2.98 eV) and ADE (2.72 eV) of 4a match the experimental VDE 2.86 \u00b1 0.03 eV and ADE 2.60 \u00b1 0.05 eV well, respectively. The VDEs of themeta-stable structures of Ni2TiO2(CO)4\n\u2212 clusters are larger than the experimental ones. In Fig. 5, there is only one main peak at 2.98 eV in the simulated PES of 4a, which is identical to the experimental feature. The peak position in the simulated spectrum of 4b deviated from the experimental one. Meanwhile, the peaks in the simulated spectrum of 4c are more than the experimental result. Therefore, 4a is the most probable structure detected in experiment."

The two CO molecules added to the two Ni atoms form terminal ones. 3a is a structure with the third COmolecule located in the middle of Ti and Ni forming bridge coordination. The fourth CO molecule in 4a locates at the middle of Ti and Ni on the other side and 4a also has C2 symmetry. Table 2 lists several characteristic bond lengths and bond angles of the ground state structures of Ni2TiO2(CO)n\n\u2212 (n = 2\u20134) clusters. The average bond lengths of Ti\u2013O, Ti\u2013Ni, Ni\u2013O, and the distance between Ni and Ni (5.295, 5.252, and 5.292 A\u030a for 2a, 3a, and 4a, respectively) remain constant as the cluster size increases, meaning that the framework of Ni2TiO2 is stable in the lowestenergy structure of Ni2TiO2(CO)n \u2212 (n = 2\u20134) clusters.

The angle of Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ni decreases as the cluster size increasing. Thus, the interaction between Ni and C becomes weaker with the cluster size increasing.\nThe natural electron conguration of the lowest-energy structures of Ni2TiO2(CO)n\n\u2212 (n = 2\u20134) clusters is shown in Table 3. The valence electron conguration of the element Ti is 3d24s2, while its 4s orbital lose electrons as well as 3d, 4p and 4d orbitals gain extra electrons in the lowest-energy structures of Ni2TiO2(CO)n\n\u2212 (n = 2\u20134) clusters. The Ti atom in 2a, 3a, and 4a totally loses 1, 0.7, and 0.4 electrons, respectively. In the two Ni atoms of all the ground state structures, though the 4s orbital lose electrons and 3d and 4p orbitals gain extra electrons, the total electrons remain unchanged. The two O atoms bonded to Ti totally gain 1.6 electrons since the 2s orbital loses 0.2 electrons and the 2p orbital gains 1 electron for each O atom. The number of electrons gained by the oxygen atom is almost equal to the number of electrons lost by the C atom in one CO molecule. Thus, the CO molecules do not gain or lose electrons. In conclusion, the extra electron is enriched on O atoms attached to Ti. The Ti atom loses electrons and the O atoms attached to Ti gain electrons, indicating strong interaction between Ti and O. Meanwhile, the interaction between CO molecules and Ni2TiO2 unit is weak. All those lead to no CO oxidation in the lowest-energy structures of Ni2TiO2(CO)n\n\u2212 (n = 2\u20134) clusters."

It provides more evidence for the reaction of multicomponent alloy with CO. The adding of CO molecules makes the interaction between Ni and C weaker. The natural electron conguration shows that the strong interaction between O and Ti and the weak interaction between CO molecules and Ni2TiO2 unit lead to the absence of CO oxidation.
