    "abstractText": "Immunotherapy targeting the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway has shown remarkable efficacy against various cancers, but the overall response rate (ORR) is still low. PD-L1 expression in tumors may predict treatment response to immunotherapy. Indeed, ongoing clinical studies utilize a few PD-L1 radiotracers to assess PDL1 expression as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy. Here, we present a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer called [68Ga]BMSH, which is derived from a small molecule inhibitor specifically targeting the binding site of PD-L1. The inhibitor was modified to optimize its in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and enable chelation of 68Ga. In vitro evaluation revealed [68Ga]BMSH possessed a strong binding affinity, high specificity, and rapid internalization in PD-L1 overexpressing cells. Biodistribution studies showed that PD-L1 overexpressing tumors had an uptake of [68Ga]BMSH at 4.22 \u00b1 0.65%ID/g in mice, while the number was 2.23 \u00b1 0.41%ID/g in PD-L1 low-expressing tumors. Micro-PET/CT imaging of tumor-bearing mice further confirmed that, compared to [18F]FDG, [68Ga]BMSH can specifically identify tumors with varying levels of PD-L1 expression. Our findings suggest that the [68Ga]BMSH is a PD-L1 radioligand with ideal imaging properties, and its further application in the clinical screening of PD-L1 overexpressing tumors may improve ORR for immunotherapy.",

            "text": "Immunotherapy has emerged as a groundbreaking approach to cancer treatment in recent years. Immune checkpoint blockade by targeting the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in treating different types of cancer, such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and bladder cancer [1\u20137]. However, only a small proportion, less than 30%, of patients are responders, though these patients usually have durable clinical responses from targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway [8\u201310]. Studies have shown that PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues is associated with the effectiveness of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy [11,12]. Patients with PD-L1 positive tumors who receive monoclonal antibodies against PD-L1 during immunotherapy can show substantial clinical benefit [13]. Therefore, the precise detection of PD-L1 expression in tumors plays a significant role in guiding clinical treatment decisions.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1487. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16101487 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1487 2 of 14\nConventional methods, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF), for detecting PD-L1 expression have notable limitations [14,15]. These methods depend on tissue sections, thus offering information solely from specific sampled regions and failing to capture the PD-L1 expression profiles throughout the entire tumor. Additionally, they are incapable of capturing dynamic changes in PD-L1 expression and providing limited quantitative measurements. PET is an advanced molecular imaging technology with high sensitivity, target specificity, and in vivo 3D imaging capabilities, which can visualize the target expression status under physiological conditions in real time [16\u201318]. PET imaging agents with high specificity can be synthesized by attaching radiotracers to monoclonal antibodies, peptides, or small molecule inhibitors that specifically target PD-L1. Subsequent PET imaging analysis enables non-invasive, real-time, and quantitative detection of PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues of patients. Recent reports have described PET targeting probes for PD-L1, including antibody-based probes [19\u201323], peptide-based probes [24\u201327], and small molecule inhibitors [28\u201330]. These probes have been utilized to assess the expression status of PD-L1 in patients with various types of solid tumors [19,27,31,32]. However, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as molecular probes have a large molecular weight and a long biological half-life, typically necessitating several days to acquire high-contrast images. The use of long half-life radionuclide for labeling mAbs typically results in heightened radiation exposure in patients. Peptide-based imaging agents exhibit lower target specificity, and their molecular properties pose challenges for chemical modifications, thus complicating the regulation of their biodistribution in vivo and pharmacokinetic performance. With advancements in the study of immune checkpoint molecules, small molecule inhibitors targeting the PD-L1 binding site have been further developed [33\u201336]. Small molecule inhibitors offer significant advantages, such as lower molecular weight, ease of modification, better penetration into solid tumors, rapid diffusion in the tumor microenvironment, and uniform distribution in the entire tumor. Lately, several reports have demonstrated that small molecules containing biarylmethyl aryl ether scaffold show high affinity for PD-L1 [28,37,38]. The PET tracer [18F]LP-F, derived from small molecule inhibitors that target PD-L1, is capable of effectively identify tumors with varying expression levels within the body [29]. However, its utilization is impeded by the significant lipophilicity of the biarylmethyl aryl ether scaffold. This attribute diminishes the metabolic clearance rate of [18F]LP-F, leading to heightened drug accumulation in multiple organs, including the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In this study, hydrophilic functional groups, biarylmethyl aryl ether scaffold (BMS-1001) linked with 1,4,7-triazacyclononane1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA), were introduced to decrease drug uptake by organs such as the lungs, liver, and gastrointestinal tract (Figure 1), aiming to improve the PD-L1 imaging capability of PET probes derived from small molecule inhibitors. The characteristics of in vitro, biodistributed, and micro-PET image results of the PET radiotracer [68Ga]BMSH were investigated. Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 15\nFigure 1.

            "text": "Studies have shown that PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues is associated with the effectiveness of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. The PET tracer [18F]LP-F, derived from a biarylmethyl aryl ether scaffold that targets PD-L1, is capable of effectively differentiating tumors with varying expression levels within the body. However, its utilization is impeded by the significant lipophilicity of the biarylmethyl aryl ether scaffold. The carbohydration has been proven to improve general pharmacokinetics, which could significantly increase the kidney clearance and reduce hepatobiliary excretion [39]. Previous studies postulate that introducing a PEG linker can increase the metabolic stability and in vivo half-life of the products [40,41]. The introduction of hydrophilic linkers such as PEG and amino acids such as Asp and Glu to the radiotracer [68Ga]BMSH could increase the hydrophilicity and reduce the lipophilicity of [68Ga]BMSH, which promotes the rapid renal metabolism of [68Ga]BMSH.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1487 8 of 14\nIn this study, we have reported the successful synthesis as well as the in vitro and in vivo characterization of a new 68Ga-labelled PD-L1 tracer and compared it to the clinically used probe, [18F]FDG. [68Ga]BMSH showed high in vitro and in vivo stability as proved by the radio-HPLC after incubation in PBS, human serum, and mouse blood. The significant difference (p < 0.05) of the cellular uptake between the A549-hPDL1 and A549 cells demonstrated that [68Ga]BMSH could specifically accumulate in high PD-L1 expression cells. The high uptake of [68Ga]BMSH at 5 min in A549-hPDL1 cells demonstrated that [68Ga]BMSH could enter cells rapidly. Additionally, the non-radioactive probe NOTABMSH could significantly inhibit the uptake of [68Ga]BMSH in A549-hPDL1 tumor cells, further indicating the specificity of [68Ga]BMSH to PD-L1. The half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of NOTA-BMSH was 448.9 nM, inferior to that of BMS-1001 (2.25 nM), indicating a little weaker affinity of NOTA-BMSH. Differences in affinity exhibited were due to structural changes resulting from the introduction of Asp, Glu, and NOTA. In addition, the relatively high internalization of [68Ga]BMSH in A549-hPDL1 cells suggests a potential for extended retention in tumor tissues. Subsequent PET imaging further demonstrated the sustained high uptake of [68Ga]BMSH in A549-hPDL1 tumor tissue after 120 min administration. Ex vivo biodistribution studies of [68Ga]BMSH revealed a high uptake (4.22\u00b1 0.65%ID/g) in PD-L1-positive A549-hPDL1 tumors with a high tumor-to-muscle ratio (5.78\u00b1 0.60) after 120 min administration. The uptake in non-target tissues was rather low (<2%ID/g), except for in the lung, liver, kidney and blood, which exhibited moderate (3.01 \u00b1 0.53%ID/g), (3.08 \u00b1 0.53%ID/g), (3.94 \u00b1 0.21%ID/g), and high uptake (7.80 \u00b1 1.14), respectively. It is worth highlighting that despite the higher lung uptake observed 30 min post-injection (8.38 \u00b1 0.54%ID/g), there is a notable decrease in lung uptake over time, reaching a value of 3.01 \u00b1 0.53%ID/g at 120 min. This value is even lower than the tumor uptake value of 4.22 \u00b1 0.65%ID/g. According to the difference between [68Ga]BMSH in lung and tumor retention time, it is expected to be used in the follow-up clinical translational research for dynamic imaging of lung cancer. Micro-PET imaging results of A549-hPDL1 and A549 xenografts also demonstrated that [68Ga]BMSH can specifically bind to the tumor and remained in the tumor for a longer period of time, which has significant advantages over [18F]FDG. Moreover, the accumulation of [68Ga]BMSH in A549-hPDL1 tumors could be blocked by co-injection of additional unlabeled inhibitors, indicating that it was a PD-L1-specific uptake. [68Ga]BMSH\u2019s internal radiation doses in humans are also deemed safe for clinical application. In short, we clearly demonstrated the feasibility of PET imaging in evaluating PD-L1 expression in xenograft mice tumor models using [68Ga]BMSH as a new radiotracer."

Using the same operating procedures, Fmoc-Glu derivatives [Fmoc-Glu(2-ACETAMIDO-2-DEOXY-BETA-D-GLUCOSAMINE) -OH] and Fmoc-NHPEG2-COOH were loaded onto the CTC resin to complete the condensation reaction. The chelator conjugation was performed through adding NOTA, HOBt, and DIC in DMF and allowing the reaction to proceed for 1.5 h. The solution was decanted, and the beads were subjected to the standard washing protocol. Subsequently, the beads were treated with a solution of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in DCM to cleave them.
