Pre-aggregating donor and acceptor polymers in 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran, processing active layers with an environmentally friendly solvent, and preparing active layers via slot-die coating could help mitigate the problems associated with N2200.12,13,33 Moreover, several research groups have modied the molecular architecture of N2200 to control the crystallinity of NDI-based polymer acceptors.

For example, Jenekhe et al.,14 Wang et al.,34 Huang et al.,35 Chen et al.,36 and Kim et al.37 had optimized the molecular structures of NDI-based polymers through a terpolymerization strategy. Therefore, random copolymerization is a potential technique for ne-tuning the crystallinity of NDI-based polymer acceptors to effectively control lm morphology.\nIn this study, we incorporated a small amount of dicyanodistyrylbenzene (DCB) unit into N2200 through random polymerization to control the molecular topology of N2200 and generate a series of new terpolymer acceptors. The synthesized terpolymer acceptors are denoted as PNDI5 and PNDI10, as they contained 5% and 10% molar concentrations of DCB, respectively (Scheme 1). Previous research had reported that introducing cyanovinylene into photoactive materials can control polymer crystallization and promote exciton dissociation and electron transport.38,39 We found that the terpolymer acceptor crystallization temperature (Tc) gradually decreased with increasing DCB concentration, as this led to a decrease in the rigidity of the molecular backbone and in intermolecular stacking.20 Compared with PNDI10-based devices, devices based on the PNDI5 and a PBDB-T (poly[(2,6(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1,3-di-2-thienyl-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2c:4,5-c]dithiophene-4,8-dione))]) donor exhibited more favorable lm morphologies, more balanced hole/electron mobilities, and lower bimolecular recombination, leading to enhanced PCE of up to 8.01% with a higher Jsc of 12.9 mA cm\n2 and ll factor (FF) of 0.75. These results demonstrate that random copolymerization, which changes the molecular structures of NDI-based polymer acceptors, is an effective strategy for manufacturing all-PSCs with favorable morphologies and enhanced efficiencies.\nScheme 1 (a) Molecular structures of polymer donor and terpolymer ac\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The synthetic route and detailed procedures for the preparation of the copolymers are described in the ESI (Fig. S1\u2020). The synthesized terpolymer acceptors (PNDI5 and PNDI10) were dissolved in common organic solvents, such as toluene, chloroform, and chlorobenzene, or transformed into uniform lms by spin-casting. The average molecular weights of the copolymers were determined via high-temperature gel permeation chromatography in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, with respect to a polystyrene standard (Table 1). The number-average molecular weights of N2200, PNDI5, and PNDI10 were 75.7, 68.5, and 60.6 kDa, with polydispersity indices of 1.83, 1.85, and 1.93, respectively.\nThe thermal properties of the polymer acceptors were evaluated via differential scanning calorimetry (Fig. 1). The melting temperatures (Tm) and crystallization temperatures (Tc) of the PNDI5 (321 C and 298 C) and PNDI10 (316 C and 286 C) copolymers were less than those of N2200 (328 C and 307 C, respectively). The reduction in Tm and Tc is attributable to the reduced intermolecular stacking of the copolymers owing to the increased backbone disorder.32 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S6, ESI\u2020) shows that the onset decomposition temperatures of the copolymers with 5% weight loss (Td) were 380.6 C, 454.8 C, 435.4 C and 420.7 C for PBDB-T, N2200, PNDI5 and PNDI10, respectively, indicating good thermal stability of the copolymers.\nceptors; (b) energy levels of PBDB-T, PNDI5, PNDI10 and N2200.\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 17898\u201317904 | 17899\nTable 1 Molecular weight, absorption, electrochemical properties, and thermal transition for copolymers\nCopolymers Mn a (kDa) PDIa lmax sol (nm) lmax lm (nm) HOMOb (eV) LUMOb (eV) Eg cv (eV) Tm ( C) TC ( C)\nN2200 75.7 1.83 706 718 5.90 3.84 2.06 304 326 PNDI5 68.5 1.85 675 696 5.92 3.85 2.07 292 313 PNDI10 60.6 1.93 645 688 5.93 3.87 2.06 284 305 a Determined by gel permeation chromatography (1,2,4-trichlorobenzene) against PS standards. b Measured by cyclic voltammetry.\nFig. 1 Differential scanning calorimetric characteristics of N2200, PNDI5, and PNDI10.

The data are detailed in ESI (Table S1\u2013S4\u2020). The current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3, and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.\nAll of the devices showed the similar open-circuit voltage (Voc). The device based on PBDB-T-N2200 (control device) showed a PCE of 6.60% (Jsc \u00bc 11.00 mA cm 2, FF \u00bc 67.22%), consistent with previous results reported for a similar active layer.42 The PNDI5-based device considerably outperformed the control device by achieving a PCE of 8.01% (Jsc \u00bc 12.32 mA cm 2; FF \u00bc 74.94%). The higher FF of the PNDI5-based device was due to its balanced hole/electron mobilities and more homogeneous morphology than the control device. Moreover, compared with the PNDI5-based device, the PNDI10-based device, with a higher DCB loading, exhibited a slightly lower PCE (6.81%; Jsc \u00bc 10.93 mA cm 2; FF \u00bc 72.00%), because of its disordered molecular packing and unfavorable blend morphology.36\nThe EQE spectral of the devices are shown in Fig. 3b. All blend lms showed a broad photocurrent response from 300 to 850 nm, consistent with their absorption spectra. This indicates that both the polymer acceptor and PBDB-T polymer donor in the blend lms exhibited a photocurrent. Devices based on PBDB-T-PNDI5 showed better spectral responses at 350\u2013750 nm than the N2200-based device, which is consistent with the higher Jsc of the former devices. The enhanced Jsc values of the\ndevices based on a random polymer acceptor correlated well with the changes in their EQE spectral responses.\nCharge generation, transport properties and recombination\nTo reveal the exciton dissociation and charge collection processes of the all-PSCs based on a PBDB-T:acceptor, we investigated the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph, Jph \u00bc JL JD, where JL and JD are the light and dark current densities, respectively) on the effective voltage (Veff, Veff \u00bc V0 Vbias, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is 0 and Vbias is the applied bias voltage.) at an illumination of 100 mW cm 2,43,44 and the relevant characteristics are shown in Fig. 4a. We presume that at a high Veff (>2 V), all photogenerated excitons were dissociated into free charges and collected by electrodes, and the Jph reaches saturation (Jsat). Thus, the maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax \u00bc Jsat/qL), where Jsat is the saturated photocurrent density, q is the electronic charge, and L is the thickness of the active layer of devices, are summarized in Table S5.\u2020 The PNDI5based devices presented slightly higher Gmax values (7.93 1027) than the N2200-based devices (7.43 1027), which indicates that the PNDI5-based device generated excitons faster than N2200 counterparts, consistent with the Jsc values. In addition, the charge-dissociation probability P(E, T) was determined by normalizing Jph with Jsat. Under short-circuit conditions, the P(E, T) values the N2200- and PNDI5-based devices were 91.60% and 94.49%, respectively. These results indicate that the PNDI5-based device exhibited better exciton dissociation rates and more efficient charge collection than the N2200based device.\nd mobility of blend films"

A balanced carrier mobility is a crucial factor affecting the FF of all-PSCs. Among all of the blends, the PNDI5-based blend lm showed the most balanced mh/me value (3.5), while the N2200and PNDI10-based blends showed unbalanced mh/me values (38 and 5.8, respectively). These results suggest that the incorporation of a small amount of DCB into the N2200 main chains resulted in a balancedmobility of charge carriers in blend lms, which is benecial for charge extraction and collection. Thus, the PNDI5-based devices achieved the best FF values in all-PSCs.

This result is consistent with the signicantly enhanced PCE of the PNDI5-based devices.\nWe further investigated the charge recombination behavior of all-PSCs by measuring the dependence of their Jsc on illumination intensity. The correlation between Jsc and illumination intensity (P) is quantitatively as Jsc f (Plight)\nS, where Plight is the light intensity and S is the exponential factor.45 When the bimolecular recombination of the charge carriers is weak, Jsc shows a linear dependence on Plight with the S value almost equal to 1. The S values from the tted line for the N2200-, PNDI5-, and PNDI10-based all-PSCs were 0.934, 0.946, 0.915, respectively (Fig. 4b), indicating that there was very weak bimolecular recombination in the device based on PBDB-T-PNDI5.

All-PSCs based on PBDB-T:PNDI5 blend exhibited a high PCE of 8.01%, which was considerably greater than that of the device based on PBDB-T-N2200 (6.60%). The enhanced photovoltaic performances of the PBDB-T:PNDI5-based devices was due to their balanced bulk charge mobility, reduced recombination, and optimized microstructure morphology. These results indicate that the construction of terpolymer acceptors based on N2200 is a promising approach for manufacturing all-PSCs."
