    "abstractText": "Bimetallic nanoparticles are important materials for synthesizing multifunctional nanozymes. A technique for preparing gold-platinum nanoparticles (NPs) on a silica core template (SiO2@Au@Pt) using seed-mediated growth is reported in this study. The SiO2@Au@Pt exhibits peroxidase-like nanozyme activity has several advantages over gold assembled silica core templates (SiO2@Au@Au), such as stability and catalytic performance. The maximum reaction velocity (Vmax) and the Michaelis\u2013 Menten constants (Km) were and 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 M\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 and 417 \u03bcM, respectively. Factors affecting the peroxidase activity, including the quantity of NPs, solution pH, reaction time, and concentration of tetramethyl benzidine, are also investigated in this study. The optimization of SiO2@Au@Pt NPs for H2O2 detection obtained in 0.5 mM TMB; using 5 \u03bcg SiO2@Au@Pt, at pH 4.0 for 15 min incubation. H2O2 can be detected in the dynamic liner range of 1.0 to 100 mM with the detection limit of 1.0 mM. This study presents a novel method for controlling the properties of bimetallic NPs assembled on a silica template and increases the understanding of the activity and potential applications of highly efficient multifunctional NP-based nanozymes.",

            "text": "Nanozymes, a new functional nanomaterial with enzyme-like catalytic activity, have several advantages when compared with natural enzymes, including high stability in harsh environments, low production costs, large specific surface areas, and customizable catalytic activities based on size, morphology, and composition [1\u201311]. A series of nanomaterials made from metals, metal oxides, and other materials including Pt [12\u201314], Au [15\u201318], Ag [19], Cu [20], Fe3O4 [21], CeO2 [22], MnO2 [23], Mn3O4 [24,25], conducting polymers [26], metal\u2013organic frameworks [27], carbon nanomaterials [28], and single-atom catalysts [29] have been prepared for use as nanozymes. These nanozymes have been used as bio(chemical) sensors, in immunoassays, for drug delivery, and as antibacterial agents [3,12,13,30\u201334]. While the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) can be adjusted by changing their size, shape, or structure, monometallic NPs are limited by other physical or chemical properties such as size-dependent optical properties, electronic properties, and thermal and catalytic effects that control the chemical compositions of NPs [35]. Several studies have been conducted on bimetallic NPs owing to the increased awareness of the options to adjust their physical and chemical properties. Compared with\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6424. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23126424 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6424 2 of 13\nmonometallic NPs, bimetallic NPs allow a greater adjustment of their magnetic, optical, and catalytic properties via adjustments of their composition and chemical configuration [36]. Bimetallic NPs have unique structure- and composition-dependent properties that allow the optimization of enzyme-like activities more than those of single-metal NPs [37,38]. The Pt family of bimetallic NPs has been developed using various morphologies including core\u2013shell structures, solid solution alloys, intermetallic alloys, and phase-segregated structures. Owing to the synergistic effect caused by the presence of Pt NPs, a super catalyst for electrochemical reactions, which are designed to maximize Pt utilization, tune the energetics, and assemble the geometry of exposed Pt atoms for high catalytic reactivity and selectivity, has been created [39,40]. Bimetallic NPs exhibit various enzyme-like activities including peroxidase, catalase, polyphenol oxidase, ferroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities [40\u201344]. Au@Pt bimetallic NPs have intrinsic peroxidase-like activities [45\u201347], have been studied extensively for electrochemical formic acid and alcohol oxidation, and Pt-rich compositions exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity [48,49]. Au@Pt NPs have extensive catalytic properties as they can effectively scavenge superoxide free radicals, H2O2, or formic acid, enabling their use in fuel cells, hydrogenation, air purification, antiaging therapy, and cancer therapy [48,50\u201352]. However, Pt tends to aggregate in catalytic reactions, resulting in reduced catalytic activity [53]. Au@Ag or Au NPs immobilized on SiO2 NPs have been developed recently [54\u201358]. In these nanostructures, the SiO2 NPs serve as a template and the metal NPs are introduced to the surface using the seed-mediated growth method. Because of the SiO2 core, the metal NPs assembled on SiO2 nanostructures are cost-effective, more stable during surface modification, easily separatable from the reaction solution, aggregate less than fine metal NPs, and redisperse into solution with enhanced separation compared with single metal NPs. Furthermore, the effects of various synthesis factors on metal NPs assembled on SiO2 have been studied using near-infrared surface enhanced Raman scattering nanoprobes for bioimaging [55,56]. However, research regarding the high peroxidase-like activity of the metal NPs assembled on SiO2 is limited. Therefore, the development of an improved method for preparing metal NPs assembled on SiO2 templates is needed to enhance peroxidase activity. This study improves the understanding of the activity and applications of highly efficient multifunctional nanozymes. In this study, gold-platinum NPs are prepared on a silica core template (SiO2@Au@Pt) using seed-mediated growth combined with the dropping method and utilize it as a nanomaterial to detect hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a model because H2O2 plays an important role in cellular metabolism and in various industry such as food industry, gas sensors, pharmaceuticals, catalysis, environment, and solar energy [59\u201361]. Therefore, the need to develop a low cost, simple, fast, and sensitive method for monitoring the concentration of H2O2 is of practical significance in both industry and academia. The preparation of SiO2@Au@Pt consists of two steps: tiny Au seeds are embedded on the SiO2 surface, and the addition of a Pt2+ precursor in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) reductant allows the deposition and growth of the Pt layer. First, a suspension of Au seeds (approximately 2.5 nm) was prepared using tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride (THPC) and HAuCl4. Then, the Au seeds were mixed with aminated SiO2 NPs (approximately 160 nm) overnight to obtain SiO2@Au seeds, as previously reported [54,55,57,58,62\u201364]. On the SiO2@Au seeds, the reduction of Pt2+ to Pt(0) was directly induced using AA, a mild reducing agent, in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). These mildly reducing conditions allow a greater control over the growth of the Pt layer as the reaction proceeds much slower than that in strongly reducing conditions [65]. A low concentration of the Pt2+ precursor and AA were added onto the SiO2@Au seeds in 5 min intervals to enable the precise control of the size of the Pt NPs. After the optimization of synthesis, SiO2@Au@Pt was used as a peroxidase-like nanomaterial to detect H2O2 efficiently.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6424 3 of 13"

Preparation of Au@Pt NPs-Assembled Silica Nanostructures\nThe seed-mediated growth from SiO2@Au seeds was used to prepare the goldplatinum-embedded silica nanospheres (SiO2@Au@Pt).

The presence of Pt on the s rface of SiO2@Au was confirmed by the line energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) ma ping of SiO2@Au@Pt (Figures 1b and S1). In Figure 1b, the signal of both Pt an Au elements could obtain in the image. The quantitative EDS analysis in Table S1 of SiO2@Au@Pt synthesized at 200 \u00b5M Pt2+ consists of 74.6% Pt and 23.6% Au as mentioned in Table S1.\nThe UV-Vis spectroscopy of SiO2@Au@Pt was conducted when the Pt2+ solution was added into the SiO2@Au seed suspension in the presence of AA. The absorbance intensity of SiO2@Au showed a slight increase at ~500 nm. This peak was suppressed in the absorbance spectrum of SiO2@Au@Pt but the spectrum of SiO2@Au@Pt increased in the UV region (Figure 1c) owing to the Pt layer, consistent with previous results of pure Pt hydrosol [66,67]. The results of TEM, EDS mapping, UV-Vis spectrum of SiO2@Au@Pt indicated that Pt was deposited to the SiO2@Au.\n2.2.

The absorbance intensities of the SiO2@Au@Pt suspension were 5.7- and 7.7-fold of those of SiO2@Au@Au at 370 and 652 nm, respectively. Similarly, the absorbance intensity of the SiO2@Au@Pt suspension at 453 nm was stronger than that of SiO2@Au@Au (Figure S3b). In addition, the recycling of both SiO2@Au@Au and SiO2@Au@Pt in the TMB-H2O2 solution at 453 nm was compared when the NPs were reused five times. The absorbance intensity of SiO2@Au@Au in a TMB-H2O2 solution at 453 nm decreased to approximately 40% while that of SiO2@Au@Pt in a TMB-H2O2 solution at 453 nm decreased to 80%. These results indicate that the catalytic ability of SiO2@Au@Pt is better than that of SiO2@Au@Au, and that SiO2@Au@Pt NPs are reusable and separatable from the reaction mixture. The catalytic performance of SiO2@Au@Pt NPs at TMB concentrations of 0\u2013600 \u00b5M was also investigated as the absorbance intensity at 652 nm in TMB-H2O2 every 3 min (Figure 2b). The absorbance intensity of the oxidation of TMB increased as the TMB concentration increased, following Michaelis\u2013Menten behavior. The signal of SiO2@Au@Pt NPs increased as the TMB concentration increased from 100 to 500 \u00b5M and reached saturation at 600 \u00b5M. The relationship of the TMB concentration and absorbance intensity at 652 nm after incubation for 180 s was plotted according to the Lineweaver\u2013Burk equation to calculate the maximum reaction velocity (Vmax) and the Michaelis\u2013Menten constants (Km) (Figure 2d). The kinetic activity of SiO2@Au@Pt at various TMB concentrations (100\u2013500 \u00b5M) revealed a linear relationship. The Km was 417 \u00b5M and the Vmax was 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 M\u22121\u00b7s\u22121. The Km of SiO2@Au@Pt indicates a higher affinity of SiO2@Au@Pt for TMB compared with that for horseradish peroxidase enzyme (Km = 438 \u00b5M). The Km of SiO2@Au@Pt was higher than those of Au NPs (Km = 123 \u00b5M), SiO2@Au@Au NPs (Km = 60 \u00b5M), glucose oxidase-conjugated Au-attached SiO2 microspheres (Km = 208 \u00b5M), MnO2 NPs (Km = 83 \u00b5M), and latex-conjugated MnO2 NPs (Km = 99 \u00b5M). The Km of SiO2@Au@Pt was lower than those of Au NPs-decorated porous silica microspheres (Km = 523 \u00b5M) and Prussianblue-decorated latex NPs (Km = 2.19 mM) [55]. The Vmax of SiO2@Au@Pt was higher than that of SiO2@Au@Au (Vmax = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 M\u22121\u00b7s\u22121), indicating that SiO2@Au@Pt oxidizes TMB at a faster rate than SiO2@Au@Au. SiO2@Au@Pt had a comparatively more stable catalytic activity that remained at 80% after five reuses (Figure 2b)."

At a high concentration of Pt2+ (>200 \u00b5M), the Au@Pt on the SiO2 surface partly merged. The quantitative EDS analysis of Pt and Au elements on the surface of SiO2 synthesized at various Pt2+ concentration was carried out to investigate the composition of the Au@Pt on the SiO2 surface and the results were shown in Table S1. All Au@Pt NPs contained both Pt and Au elements, but their Au and Pt components were different. The atomic Pt component increased from 71.59% to 87.07% while the atomic Au component decreased from 28.41 to 12.93% when Pt2+ increased from 100 \u00b5M to 400 \u00b5M. Therefore, the reciprocal of Pt and Au increased from 2.5 (at 100 \u00b5M Pt2+) to 6.7 (at 400 \u00b5M Pt2+). The results matched to the TEM images, and it indicated that Pt was gradually deposited on the surface of SiO2@Au.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 6424 6 of 13 Int. J. Mol.

The growth of Au@Pt NPs on SiO2 could be controlled well (Figure 3).\nThe correlation between the peroxidase-like activity of SiO2@Au@Pt NPs and the concentration of Pt2+ was investigated (Figure 3c). The peroxidase-like activity of SiO2@Au@Pt NPs synthesized with 100\u2013400 \u00b5M Pt2+ was estimated using a TMB assay. The SiO2@Au seeds showed very weak peroxidase-like activity because of the lack of spaces on the SiO2@Au NPs and the small Au NPs on the SiO2 template, resulting an insufficient surface area for the catalytic reaction between the Au NPs and the TMB-H2O2 mixture [55]. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of all SiO2@Au@Pt NPs showed an absorbance peak at 453 nm (Figure 3c\u2013e), indicating that all of the SiO2@Au@Pt NPs had peroxidase-like activity that was dependent on the initial Pt2+ concentration.\nIn contrast, SiO2@Au@Pt NPs treated with a Pt3+ precursor concentration >100 \u00b5M had high peroxidase-like activity. As the concentration of Pt2+ increased, the size of the Au@Pt NPs on the SiO2@Au@Pt NPs increased from 3.1 to 4.6 nm, which increased the surface area for reactions between NPs and reactants. Therefore, the catalytic activity of SiO2@Au@Pt NPs increased as the concentration of the Pt2+ precursor increased from 100 to 200 \u00b5M because of the formation of sublayers or a monolayer of Pt on the surface of SiO2@Pt [45,67]. This result consistent with the previous report where the increase of Pt component of Au-Pt led an better catalytic activity because the alloying of Pt with Au can change the electronic structure of Pt, leading the catalytic performance of Au@Pt changes [11,37,69]. Although the Au@Pt NPs grew as the concentration of the Pt2+ precursor increased, the peroxidase reaction of SiO2@Au@Pt treated with >200 \u00b5M of the Pt2+ precursor did not increase because TMB and H2O2 cannot gain access to inner part of the thick Pt layer [66]. It means that the catalytic activities of SiO2@Au@Pt reached the highest value at the Pt/Au ratio of 3.2 and decreased when Pt2+ concentration increased further. Therefore, 200 \u00b5M of Pt2+ precursor-treated SiO2@Au@Pt NPs, which exhibited high peroxidase-like activity, were used in subsequent experiments.\nThe absorption spectra of SiO2@Au@Pt were collected (Figure 3b).

            "text": "The SiO2@Au seed NPs were synthesized as previously reported [54]. Briefly, colloidal Au NPs were prepared from HAuCl4 and THPC. Silica templates (approximately 160 nm) were prepared using the modified St\u00f6ber method [84]. The surfaces of 50 mg SiO2 NPs were modified using amino groups via incubation with 62 \u00b5L APTS overnight at 25\u25e6C. Animated SiO2 NPs (2 mg) were incubated with 10 mL colloidal Au (approximately 2.5 nm) for 12 h at 25\u25e6C. After the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 8500 rpm and washed with EtOH, 2 mg of SiO2@Au seed NPs were dispersed in 2 mL of 1 mg/mL PVP solution. Subsequently, 200 \u00b5L of SiO2@Au seed (1 mg/mL) suspension was mixed with 9.8 mL of PVP solution. Under stirring, 20 \u00b5L of 10 mM HPtCl6 solution (in water, Pt2+ precursor) and 40 \u00b5L of AA reducing agent (10 mM AA in water) were added to the mixture. The mixture was reacted for 5 min under stirring to convert Pt2+ to Pt(0). The same volumes of Pt2+ precursor and AA were added every 5 min to obtain the desired concentration of Pt2+. The SiO2@Au@Pt NPs were then carefully washed with EtOH several times using centrifugation at 8500 rpm for 10 min. The washed SiO2@Au@Pt NPs were redispersed in 0.1% PBST solution (1 mL) to obtain a 0.2 mg/mL SiO2@Au@Pt NP suspension."

            "text": "In summary, SiO2@Au@Pt NPs were successfully synthesized using the seed-mediated growth method under mild conditions. Compared with SiO2@Au@Au, the SiO2@Au@Pt NPs exhibited more synergic and stable catalytic abilities that remained at 80% after five uses of 5 \u00b5g SiO2@Au@Pt NPs. In addition, the peroxidase-like activity of SiO2@Au@Pt NPs under various conditions such as the amount of SiO2@Au@Pt NPs, pH of the buffer solution, incubation time, and TMB concentration were also investigated, revealing optimized conditions of 5 \u00b5g SiO2@Au@Pt at pH 4.0, with 15 min of incubation in the presence of 500 \u00b5M TMB. SiO2@Au@Pt was used to detect H2O2. The dynamic linear range was obtained from 1 to 100 mM, with an LOD of 1.0 mM. Therefore, this study suggests novel uses of bimetallic metal-assembled silica nanostructures in various fields and provides a suitable method for the development of nanoparticle-based multi-functional nanozymes.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms23126424/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.-H.P., V.-K.T., and B.-H.J.; methodology, V.-K.T. and X.-H.P.; investigation, W.K. and Y.-H.K.; formal analysis, X.-H.P., E.H., and J.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, V.-K.T., X.-H.P., and E.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.K. and B.-H.J.; supervisor, B.-H.J.
