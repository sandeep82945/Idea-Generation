 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct an in vivo study in animal models to validate the in vitro findings on the effects of AABP-2B on glucose metabolism, gut microbiota modulation, and production of SCFAs. This will provide more physiologically relevant evidence. 

2. Investigate the mechanisms by which AABP-2B inhibits Î±-glucosidase activity and modulates gut microbiota. This could involve evaluating effects on gene expression, enzyme kinetics, microbiome metabolic pathways, etc. 

3. Explore structure-activity relationships by modifying the molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkages, and other structural features of AABP-2B. This can identify the key structural elements that contribute to its biological activities.

4. Evaluate the synergistic effects of combining AABP-2B with other prebiotics, probiotics, or antidiabetic agents. This may produce enhanced benefits compared to individual agents. 

5. Conduct human clinical trials to evaluate the effects of AABP-2B supplementation on markers of glycemic control, gut microbiota composition, and production of beneficial metabolites in patients with diabetes or metabolic disorders. This will provide direct evidence of efficacy and safety in humans.
