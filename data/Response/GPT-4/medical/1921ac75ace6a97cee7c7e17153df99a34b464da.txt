Comparative Genomic and Transcriptomic Analysis of EPS-Producing vs. Non-EPS-Producing LAB Strains: Investigate the genetic basis and regulatory mechanisms that govern EPS production in LAB, particularly Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. This study could identify specific genes and pathways that are crucial for EPS biosynthesis and regulation, providing insights into how different environmental conditions or substrates influence EPS production.

Development of Novel Fermentation Strategies to Enhance EPS Production: Explore the impact of various fermentation conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, oxygen level) and strategies (e.g., co-culturing with other microorganisms, batch vs. continuous fermentation) on the yield and properties of EPS. This research could lead to optimized fermentation processes that maximize EPS production for industrial applications.

Functional and Nutritional Evaluation of EPS-Enriched Foods: Examine the effects of incorporating EPS, particularly from Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, into various food matrices on the nutritional value, sensory properties, and shelf-life of the final products. This could include studies on the prebiotic effects of EPS, its impact on gut health, and its role in improving food texture and stability.

Elucidation of the Structure-Function Relationship of LAB-Derived EPS: Perform detailed structural characterization of EPS molecules and correlate these structures with their functional properties, such as viscosity, emulsification, and bioactivity (e.g., anti-cancer, antioxidant, immune-modulating activities). This research could identify novel EPS with specific health benefits or technological applications.

Engineering LAB Strains for Tailored EPS Production: Use metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches to modify LAB strains, aiming to produce EPS with desired properties or to enhance their yield. This could involve the introduction of novel biosynthetic pathways, modification of existing pathways, or optimization of regulatory mechanisms to increase the diversity and functionality of EPS produced by LAB.
