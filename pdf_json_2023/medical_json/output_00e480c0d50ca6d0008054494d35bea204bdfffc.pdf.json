The aim of this study is to investigate the antibacterial 22 effect of mechanically ground and spray dried Acacia senegal against 23 Enterococcus faecalis. 24\nMethod: 25\nAntibacterial susceptibility test against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) has 26 been performed for 200mg of ethanolic extracts of spray dried & mechanically 27 ground Gum Arabic. Sodium Hypochlorite (1%), Chlorhexidine (0.2%) and 28 Antibiotic multi disc for gram positive bacteria have been used as positive controls 29 and ethanol as a negative control.

            "text": "Introduction: 59 Enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive, facultative anaerobic coccus bacteria. It 60 can survive under harsh conditions (1, 2). They are part of the habitual flora in the 61 mouth, human gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract. E. faecalis is a known 62 cause of endodontic treatment failure as well as some systemic diseases. They have 63 developed high resistance to antimicrobial agents (1). 64\nIsolates from oral infections differ from hospital-derived isolates as they do not 65 present many mobile genetic elements. However, oral isolates have virulence 66 factors related to adhesion and biofilm formation, which help the bacteria to 67 colonize different oral sites. Moreover, oral strains may also carry specific 68 antibiotic resistance determinants that have the potential to be transferred to other 69 pathogenic bacteria in biofilm communities (2). 70\nSynthetic drugs have been preferred for decades, but now herbal medicines are 71 being used. Recently, several plants have been investigated for their ability to 72 inhibit the growth of microorganisms(3). Screening of promising medicinal plants 73 is ongoing now and then. 74 Gum Arabic \u201cAcacia Senegal\u201d has been considered one of 10 promising medicinal 75 plants in Africa (4). It is a naturally occurring gum that exudes from Acacia trees 76 (5). Sudan is the leading producer of Acacia Gums worldwide, followed by 77\nNigeria, Chad, Mali, and Senegal (6). Phytochemical screening of Acacia senegal 78 has displayed the presence of tannins, glycosides, and flavonoids, in addition to 79 oxidases, peroxidases, and pectinases, which have antimicrobial properties (7-10). 80\nMany studies have proved the antibacterial efficacy of Gum Arabic against various 81 bacterial species (7, 8, 11-15). 82\nA considerable number of medicinal plants have been investigated for their 83 antimicrobial potency against Enterococcus faecalis (16). No studies consider the 84 effect of Gum Arabic against Enterococcus faecalis. 85\nGum Arabic \u201cAcacia Senegal\u201d is processed differently according to the required 86 quality. Mechanical milled Gum Arabic, on which the dried Gum nodules are 87 crushed mechanically to produce a granular powder. Spray dried Gum Arabic, on 88 which solution of Gum Arabic is pasteurized and sprayed into a stream of hot air to 89 completely evaporate the water leaving the dry powder of Gum Arabic. Gum 90 Arabic produced by spray drying has an advantage over raw gum as it is free of 91 microbial contamination and dissolves much faster.

After that, nodules have air-dried at room temperature 101 away from the sun and processed in two different processing methods, spray 102 drying and mechanically grounding with a pestle and mortar. 103 Preparation of extract: 104 One hundred and fifty grams of each type of Gum Arabic have soaked in ethanol 105 (70%) for three days with daily filtration. The solvent has been evaporated under 106 reduced pressure using rotary evaporator apparatus. The extracts of both types of 107 Gum Arabic have been inserted in a freeze dryer till complete dryness. 108 Antibacterial susceptibility test: 109 Antibacterial susceptibility test has performed by Agar disc diffusion 110 according to the method of Elkhateeb 2017 (17) with the following steps: 111\n1. Preparation of the media: Muller-Hinton Agar (HIMEDIA, REF. M173-500G) 112 has been prepared according to instructions. Each 20 mL of the freshly prepared 113 and autoclaved Muller-Hinton agar has been poured into a sterile petri dish and 114 maintained at room temperature to cool down. Before use, the plates were 115 incubated at 35 \u00b0C for 48 hours, and the sterility was checked. 116\n2. Preparation of discs: Filter paper discs of 6 mm diameter have been 117 prepared from Whatman filter paper No. 1, placed in a petri dish, and sterilized 118 in a hot air oven at 160 \u00b0C for two hours. 119\n3. Preparation of extracts solutions: 200 mg of each extract has been dissolved 120 in 1ml of solvent (ethanol 70%) and mixed in a vortex to ensure complete 121 dissolution. 122\n4. Reactivation and inoculation of Enterococcus faecalis: E. faecalis (ATCC 123 29212) has reactivated into 5ml of brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (HIMEDIA, 124 REF. M210-500G) and left under anaerobic conditions for 48 hours. A sterile 125 cotton swab has been used to inoculate E. faecalis from BHI broth into a 126 Muller Hinton Agar plate. The plate was incubated under anaerobic conditions 127 at 37\u25e6 for 24 hours. 128\n5. Preparation and standardization of inoculum suspension: Three to five 129 well-isolated colonies of the same morphological type have been selected from 130 a Muller Hinton Agar plate culture and transferred with a sterile loop into a 131 tube containing 5 ml of BHI broth. The broth was incubated anaerobically at 132 37 \u00b0C for 24 hours. The turbidity of E. faecalis suspension has been adjusted 133 equal to that of 0.5 McFarland standard (1.5 \u00d7 108 CFU/ml) by using BHI 134 broth to dilute of E. faecalis suspension. 135\n6. Antibacterial susceptibility test: 136 Sterile cotton swab was rolled in the adjusted bacterial suspension to streak the 137 five plates\u2019 surface of Muller Hinton Agar. 138 Each three sterile discs have immersed in 10 \u00b5L of the following extracts 139 solutions: 140\n\u2022 Spray-dried Gum Arabic 141\n\u2022 Mechanically ground Gum Arabic 142 Ethanol (70%) (Reagents Duksan, Ethyl Alcohol, absolute, product No.6923, 2.5L) 143 has been used as a negative control. 144\nChlorhexidine 0.2% (Clenora mouthwash, BP 0.2%w/v), Sodium hypochlorite 1% 145 (Prevest Denpro Hyposol, 3% Sodium hypochlorite 500 ml), and Readymade 146 multidisc for Gram-positive isolates (Axiom laboratories, Code No. 001, Mantola 147 Pahar Ganj- New Delhi-110055) have used as positive controls. 148\nThe antibiotics included in the multidisc for Gram-positive have displayed in 149 (Figure 1). 150\nThe saturated discs have transferred to their coded plates which inoculated with E. 151 faecalis.

The diameter of the inhibition zone has been 154 measured. 155\n156\nResults: 157\nGum Arabic with different processing method inhibited the growth of E. faecalis 158 with variant degrees. The inhibition zone measurements reflect the degree of 159 antibacterial activity (Table 1) (Fig. 2-7). Data has been analyzed using SPSS 20. 160\nGum Arabic, with both processing methods, displayed antibacterial activity against 161 E. faecalis. However, the inhibition zone of the spray-dried Gum Arabic (14.67 162 mm) was significantly higher than mechanically ground (8.67mm) (level of 163 significance\u22640.05, P-value =0.02). 164 Gum Arabic, with both processing methods, exhibited lower antibacterial activity 165 against E. faecalis than chlorhexidine (0.2%). The result was significant with the 166 mechanically ground variant, but the spray dried Gum showed no significance (P- 167 Values in Table 2). 168 Spray-dried Gum Arabic displayed a greater diameter of the inhibition zone 169 (14.67mm) than 1% Sodium hypochlorite (12mm), but the mechanically ground 170 type showed lower activity (8.67mm). However, both results showed no statistical 171 significance (P-values in Table 2). 172 Only Ciprofloxacin 5mcg, Levofloxacin 5mcg, Cotrimoxazole 25mcg & 173 Tetracycline 300mcg of antibiotics in the multidisc for Gram-positive bacteria 174 exhibited antibacterial activity against E. faecalis (Table 1). 175\nOne sample t-test was used to check the significant difference when comparing 176 Gum Arabic to antibiotic multidisc (Tables 3, 4, and 5). 177 Gum Arabic, with both processing methods, displayed significantly lower 178 antibacterial activity to E. faecalis than (Ciprofloxacin 5mcg) & (Levofloxacin 179 5mcg) (P-values in Table 3). 180 Spray-dried Gum Arabic (14.6 mm) showed almost the same antibacterial effect 181 against E. faecalis as Cotrimoxazole 25 mcg (15mm), but the result was 182 statistically not significant. However, mechanically ground Gum Arabic was 183 significantly lower than Cotrimoxazole (P-values in Table 4). 184 Spray-dried Gum Arabic displayed significantly higher antibacterial activity 185 against E. faecalis than (Tetracycline 300mcg). In contrast, mechanically ground 186 showed lower antibacterial activity than Tetracycline with no statistical 187 significance (P-values in Table 5). 188 Chlorhexidine (0.2%) showed a greater inhibition zone diameter (16 mm) against 189 E. faecalis than sodium hypochlorite (1%) (12mm). However, the result was 190 statistically insignificant (level of significance\u22640.05, P-value=0.11). 191\n192\n193\nDiscussion: 194\nSpray-dried Gum Arabic was found to be active antibacterial against Enterococcus 195 faecalis. In contrast, mechanically ground Gum was found to be inactive 196 antibacterial. The activity scale used in the study referred to Alves et al.(18), and 197 Mukhtar & Ghori (19), who regarded an inhibition zone less than 9mm (inactive 198 product), 9-12mm (partially active product), 13-18mm (active product) , and more 199 than 18mm(very active product). 200\nThe chemical composition of Gum Arabic and its pharmacological properties may 201 not always be consistent or stable. It may vary depending on several climatic 202 factors, edaphic conditions, season, age of the tree from which the gum is 203 collected, and other variables (20). 204\nThe current study has displayed better antibacterial activity of spray-dried Gum 205 Arabic against E. faecalis over the mechanically ground type. This result clearly 206 reflects the effect of the processing method on the antibacterial activity of Gum 207 Arabic against E. faecalis. However, variation in the processing method does not 208 necessarily affect the antibacterial activity of Gum Arabic against all bacterial 209 specie. It has been found that variation in the processing method did not affect the 210 antibacterial activity of Gum Arabic against Streptococcus mutans.( N. Elmubarak, Y. 211 Ibrahim, A. Gareeballah, and N. Sanhouri submitted for publication) 212\nBased on the current study, the authors agreed with Ali and his colleagues (20), 213 who recommended using of a single source of Gum Arabic for research work to 214 achieve standardization for different studies. 215\nAntibacterial activity of spray dried Gum Arabic and mechanically ground is also 216 differ in their statistical significance when compare them to chlorhexidine and 217 sodium hypochlorite 218\nThis study has displayed that Chlorhexidine (0.2%) has greater antibacterial 219 activity against E. faecalis than Sodium hypochlorite (1%). This result come in 220 corroborates with Ferraz et al. (21) and Echeverri & Alderete (22) 221\nConclusion: 222\nThe method of Gum Arabic processing affected its antibacterial potency. Spray-223 dried Gum Arabic is considered an active antibacterial agent against E. faecalis, 224 while mechanically ground type is regarded as non-active. 225\nSpray-dried Gum Arabic has higher antibacterial activity against E. faecalis than 226 Tetracycline 300mcg. 227\n228\nReferences: 229 1.
