    "abstractText": "Nonradiative recombination losses caused by defects in the perovskite layer seriously affects the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Hence, defect passivation is an effective way to improve the performance of PSCs. In this work, trichloromelamine (TCM) was used as a defects passivator by adding it into the perovskite precursor solution. The experimental results show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSC increased from 18.87 to 20.15% after the addition of TCM. What\u2019s more, the environmental stability of PSCs was also improved. The working mechanism of TCM was thoroughly investigated, which can be ascribed to the interaction between the \u2013NH\u2013 group and uncoordinated lead ions in the perovskite. This work provides a promising strategy for achieving highly efficient and stable PSCs.",

            "text": "Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite has demonstrated its application potential in the photovoltaic field due to its unique properties, such as its strong light absorption capacity, long charge carrier diffusion length, high charge carrier mobility, and adjustable band gap [1\u20135]. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSC) has increased from 3.8% to 25.5%, which is comparable to the commercial Si-based solar cell [6]. Although great progress has been made with respect to the performance of PSC, there are still several challenges which remain. One of the key problems is defects in the perovskite films, such as uncoordinated sites (lead and halide ions) [7], lead clusters [8], and vacancy defects [9], which will lead to non-radiative recombination losses. The interaction of these defects with moisture and oxygen will also cause the degradation of the perovskite [10\u201312]. The use of additives for defect passivation is an effective strategy to improve the PCE and stability of PSCs [13,14]. Many types of additives, such as polymers [15], fullerene and its derivatives [16], inorganic acid [17], organic halide salt [18], metal halide salt [19], and nanoparticles [20] were applied to achieve grain boundary (GBs) passivation through morphology control or passivation of crystal defects [21\u201324]. Among them, selecting organic molecules with specific functional groups is very effective to improve the PCE and stability of PSCs. For example, the introduction of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APMS) inhibited ion migration and passivated defects in perovskite layer because of the interaction\nPolymers 2022, 14, 398. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14030398 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 398 2 of 11\nbetween the amino- group and Pb or I ions, leading to the morphology improvement of perovskite film [25]. The PCE of PSC increased from 18.85 to 20.72% [25]. After adding maleimide undecanoic acid (11MA) to the perovskite precursor solution, the density of trap states in perovskite layer reduced due to the strong coordination interaction between 11MA and Pb2+, resulting in the increase of PCE from 18.24 to 23.34% [26]. The additive molecules with \u03c0-conjugated structure are more likely to gather at the perovskite GBs, inducing the interconnection of the perovskite grains and therefore the more stable PSC [27]. In this work, a low-price organic molecular, trichloromelamine (TCM) was used as a defects passivator in the MAPbI3 light-absorbing layer by adding it into the perovskite precursor solution. The chlorine substituted amino groups with Lewis base characteristics in the molecular structure of TCM will simultaneously improve the morphology and passivate defects of the perovskite film. MAPbI3 film with improved crystallinity and reduced defect density was obtained. With 0.05 wt% TCM, the PCE of the PSC increased from 18.87% of control device to 20.15%. In addition, after 48 h aging in the dark with 80% humidity at room temperature, the encapsulated device with TCM retained its initial PCE of 77.31%, while the value for the control device is 31.2%. The mechanism was thoroughly investigated, which can be ascribed to the interaction between the \u2013NH\u2013 group in TCM and lead ions in MAPbI3."

Thus, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of MAPbI3 films were demonstrated, as shown in Figure 1. The crystal sizes were estimated by using Nano Measurer 1.2 software. For MAPbI3 films doped with 0, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 wt% TCM, the average grain sizes are 246, 260, 308, and 221 nm, respectively (Figure 1e). Compared with the pristine film, when the doping concentration of TCM increased from 0.01 wt% to 0.1 wt%, the grain size of MAPbI3 increased first and then decreased. The MAPbI3 film with 0.05 wt% TCM (hereinafter refer to as 0.05 TCM film) has the largest grain size. The effect of TCM on the crystallinity of MAPbI3 was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Figure 1f). All the XRD patterns show significant peaks at 13.90\u25e6 and 28.17\u25e6, which are corresponding to the (110) and (220) planes of MAPbI3, respectively. It indicates that all MAPbI3 films have orthorhombic crystal structure. Meanwhile, the XRD peak intensity obviously varied after doping TCM, which increased first and then decreased with the concentration increased from 0.01 wt% and 0.05 wt% to 0.1 wt%. The perovskite film with 0.05 wt% TCM has the strongest peak intensity, indicating the best crystallinity. Cross-sectional SEM images of PSCs further proves the crystallinity improvement after adding TCM, as shown in Figure S1. The average thickness of the pristine perovskite layer is 243 nm. It is 260 nm with 0.05 wt% TCM, indicating the larger grain size."

The same shape of UV-Vis absorption spectra reflects that the crystal structure of MAPbI3 film did not change, which is consistent with the XRD results. The absorbance intensity slightly increased at the wavelength lower than 500 nm after adding 0.05 wt% TCM, which can be ascribed to the larger grain size. In addition, for semiconductors, the absorbing edge is called the Urbach tail, which is related to Urbach energy (Eu). Generally, the Urbach energy is the tail width of the local defect\nPolymers 2022, 14, 398 4 of 11\nstate in the band gap, which can be calculated by fitting the exponential part of the Urbach tail according to Equation (1) [28]:\n\u03b1(E) = \u03b10 \u2217 exp [ E \u2212 E0\nEu ] (1)\nwhere \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient and E is the photon energy [29,30]. Eu value can be calculated by plotting Ln(\u03b1) against E, as shown in Figure 2b. The calculated Eu values are 50.9 meV and 39.96 meV for the pristine and 0.05 TCM MAPbI3 films, respectively. The lower Eu value indicated the reduced defect density. It means that the adding of 0.05 wt% TCM reduced the defect density of MAPbI3 film. It was further proved by measuring the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, as shown in Figure 2c. The PL intensity of MAPbI3 film is significantly enhanced with the addition of 0.05 wt% TCM, indicating the reduction of nonradiative recombination losses (which is always caused by defects). In addition, after the addition of TCM, the PL peak blue-shifted from 796.5 nm to 795.9 nm, which can be ascribed to the reduction of surface defects [31]. Therefore, the surface defects of MAPbI3 film were passivated by adding TCM, which can also be proved by the Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) data, as shown in Figure 2d. The Fermi energy level (EF) with respect to the valance band maximum (VBM) of perovskite films shift from 1.06 to 0.96 eV (Figure 2d) after the introduction of TCM, indicating that it is closer to the center of the bandgap (Eg: 1.55 eV for MAPbI3). Thus, the perovskite is more like the intrinsic semiconductor after the passivation of surface defects by TCM [32]. The above experimental results show that the defects of the perovskite film reduced after adding 0.05 wt% TCM. Polymers 2022, 14, x 4 of 12"

In\naddition, after the addition of TCM, the PL peak blue-shifted from 796.5 nm to 795.9 nm,\nwhich can be ascribed to the reduction of surface defects [31]. Therefore, the surface de-\nfects of MAPbI3 film were passivated by adding TCM, which can also be proved by the\nUltraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) data, as shown in Figure 2d. The Fermi en-\nergy level (EF) with respect to the valance band maximum (VBM) of perovskite films shift\nfrom 1.06 to 0.96 eV (Figure 2d) after the introduction of TCM, indicating that it is closer\nto the center of the bandgap (Eg: 1.55 eV for MAPbI3). Thus, the perovskite is more like the\ni es f er s it fil it iff r t i t r ti s f : (a) 0 , ( ) 0.01 t , . . ; fi ;\nperovskite fil s.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 398 5 of 11\nPolymers 2022, 14, x 5 of 12\nintrinsic semiconductor after the passivation of surface defects by TCM [32]. The above\nexperimental results show that the defects of the perovskite film reduced after adding 0.05\nwt% TCM.\nIn order to explore the work mechanism of defect passivation, 1H nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) tests were con-\nducted. Figure 3a shows the 1H NMR spectra of pure TCM and the mixture of PbI2 and\nTCM. After adding PbI2, the chemical shift of the hydrogen peak corresponding to the \u2013\nNH\u2013 group of TCM shifted from 7.81 to 7.71 ppm. It indicates that Pb2+ interacted with\nthe \u2013NH\u2013 group in TCM. FT-IR was also used to detect the interaction between the \u2013NH\u2013\ngroup of TCM and Pb2+ (Figures 3b and S2). For pure TCM, the characteristic peak of the\nstretching vibration of the \u2013NH\u2013 group located at 1660 cm\u22121, which is 1651 cm\u22121 for the\nmixture of TCM and PbI2. The shift of the peak position indicates the interaction between\nthe \u2013NH\u2013 group and Pb2+. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) pattern (Figure 3c)\nshows that the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 signals shift from 137.8 eV and 142.7 eV to 137.6 eV and\n142.5 eV, respectively, after the addition of TCM. It demonstrated that the binding energy\nof the Pb 4f peak reduced by 0.2 eV, which indicates the decreased cationic charge of un-\nder-coordinated Pb2+ [33].\nTo estimate the defect of density (Ndefects) of perovskite films, electron-only and hole-\nonly devices with the structure of ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag and\nITO/NiOx/MAPbI3/PTAA/Ag were fabricated, respectively.

It demonstrated that the binding energy of the Pb 4f peak reduced by 0.2 eV, which indicates the decreased cationic charge of under-coordinated Pb2+ [33]. To estimate the defect of density (Ndefects) of perovskite films, electron-only and holeonly devices with the structure of ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag and ITO/NiOx/MAPbI3 /PTAA/Ag were fabricated, respectively. The J-V curves are shown in Figure 4. The density\nf the defects can be calculated in the space-charge-limited current region by Equation (2):\nNde f ect = 2\u03b5e0VTFL\neL2 (2)\nwhere \u03b5 is the relative dielectric constant [34], \u03b50 is the vacuum permittivity, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, e is the unit charge, and VTFL is the trap-filled-limit (TFL) voltage. VTFL refers to the voltage at the kink point from linear region to the TFL region. The Ndefects and VTFL values are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the density of the electronic defect of the control device is about twice that of the device with 0.05 wt% TCM. The density of the hole defect states are only slightly reduced (from 2.8 \u00d7 1016\nPolymers 2022, 14, 398 6 of 11\nto 2.2 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123). Combined with the results of UPS, this means that the addition of TCM effectively passivated the n-type undercoordinated Pb2+ defects on the surface of the perovskite film. Therefore, after the addition of TCM, the surface of the perovskite film is more intrinsic. This is consistent with the passivation mechanism of TCM doping described above.\nPolymers 2022, 14, x 6 of 12\nwhere \u03b5 is the relative dielectric constant [34], \u03b50 is the vacuum permittivity, L is the thick-\nness of the perovskite film, e is the unit charge, and VTFL is the trap-filled-limit (TFL) volt-\nage.

The experimental error values were obtained by subtracting the average value and then divided the results by two. The control device shows a short circuit current\nPolymers 2022, 14, 398 7 of 11\ndensity (JSC) of 22.63 \u00b1 0.43 mA cm\u22122, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.067 V and a fill factor (FF) of 78.14 \u00b1 0.72%, resulting in a PCE of 18.87 \u00b1 0.46%. With the addition of TCM, the performance of PSCs depended on the ratio of TCM. As the weight ratio of TCM increased (VOC), FF and PCE both increased and reached 0.05 wt%. Then, when it continued to increase to 0.1%, JSC had a significant drop. Thus, 0.05 wt% is the optimized weight ratio of TCM, based on which PSC with a VOC of 1.085 V, a JSC of 22.68 \u00b1 0.28 mA cm\u22122, a FF of 81.81 \u00b1 1.66%, and therefore a PCE of 20.15% \u00b1 0.41% was obtained. Obviously, the increase of PCE is mainly caused by the enhancement of VOC and FF, which may benefit from the film quality improvement of the perovskite layer. The statistics of the photovoltaic performance parameters of PSC (Figure 5b) shows that the 0.05% TCM device not only has higher photovoltaic parameters than the control device but also shows that the distribution is more concentrated. It indicates that after adding TCM, the repeatability of the device is also improved.

It further proves that the defects density of perovskite film with\n0.05 wt% TCM reduced [35], which is conducive to the transfer of charge. Therefore, the series resistance (Rs) of the 0.05 wt% TCM device decreased from 50.28 \u03a9\u00b7cm\u22122 of the control device to 29.57 \u03a9\u00b7cm\u22122, as shown in Table 2.

The reduction of Rs value is also responsible for the increase in the FF of PSC. In order to further explore the electrical and optical properties of TCM doped perovskite films, the light intensity depe ence of VOC had been investigated. It can provide more detailed information about the reorganization process under open circuit conditions according the following Equatio (3) [36,37]\n\u03b4Voc = n (\nkBT e\n) Ln(I) + constant (3)\nwhere n is the ideality factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, q is the elementary charge, T is the absolute temperature, and I is the light intensity. The 0.05 wt% TCM device exhibits a higher VOC than the control device under the same light intensity (Figure 5d). A plot of VOC as a function of logarithmic light intensity Ln(I) is linearly fitted to evaluate the slope, n (kBT/e), which represents the recombination process caused by the trap states in the optoelectronic device. The slope value of the 0.05 TCM device is 1.14 kBT/e, which is 1.704 kBT/e for the control device. The decrease in the slope value means that TCM doping can effectively reduce the trap-assisted carrier recombination, which is consistent with the above results. In order to evaluate the environmental stability of PSCs, the PCE of PSCs were measured during storage. Figure 6a shows the normalized PCE against time. After being stored under 80% humidity in the dark at room temperature for 50 h, the PCE of the 0.05 wt% TCM device retained 77.3% of its initial value, while the value for the control device is 31.2%. Obviously, the 0.05 wt% TCM device is more stable than the control device. XRD was also used to detect the stability of perovskite film after being exposed to ambient air\nPolymers 2022, 14, 398 9 of 11\nwith a humidity of 80% in the dark for a week. As shown in Figure 6b, the peak at 12.8\u25e6 is observed for both film, which is corresponding to the (100) plane of PbI2. Meanwhile, in the XRD pattern of the newly fabricated MAPbI3 film (Figure 1f), there was no peak at 12.8\u25e6. The precipitation of lead iodide after storage indicates the decomposition of MAPbI3. Meanwhile, the peak intensity at 12.8\u25e6 for the 0.05 TCM MAPbI3 film is much lower than that of the pristine film, indicating less MAPbI3 decomposed. It means that TCM additive effectively protected the perovskite film from moisture. The contact angle of water on the perovskite film was measured, as shown in Figure 6c\u2013d. It shows that the 0.05 TCM MAPbI3 film is more hydrophobic than the pristine film (54.2\u25e6 vs. 40.9\u25e6), which is also responsible for the improved environment stability of the perovskite film and PSCs.
