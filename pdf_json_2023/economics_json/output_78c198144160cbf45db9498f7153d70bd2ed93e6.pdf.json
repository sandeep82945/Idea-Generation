    "abstractText": "The biomass of microalgae and the compounds that can be obtained from their processing are of great interest for various economic sectors. Chlorophyll from green microalgae has biotechnological applications of great potential in different industrial areas such as food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and agriculture. In this paper, the experimental, technical and economic performance of biomass production from a microalgal consortium (Scenedesmus sp., Chlorella sp., Schroderia sp., Spirulina sp., Pediastrum sp., and Chlamydomonas sp.) was investigated in three cultivation systems (phototrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic) in combination with the extraction of chlorophyll (a and b) on a large scale using simulation; 1 ha was established as the area for cultivation. In the laboratory-scale experimental stage, biomass and chlorophyll concentrations were determined for 12 days. In the simulation stage, two retention times in the photobioreactor were considered, which generated six case studies for the culture stage. Subsequently, a simulation proposal for the chlorophyll extraction process was evaluated. The highest microalgae biomass concentration was 2.06 g/L in heterotrophic culture, followed by mixotrophic (1.98 g/L). Phototrophic and mixotrophic cultures showed the highest chlorophyll concentrations of 20.5 \u03bcg/mL and 13.5 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The simulation shows that higher biomass and chlorophyll production is attained when using the mixotrophic culture with 72 h of retention that we considered to evaluate chlorophyll production (a and b). The operating cost of the entire process is very high; the cultivation stage has the highest operating cost (78%), mainly due to the high energy consumption of the photobioreactors.",

Microalgae are of great importance in several areas of study due to their high biotechnological potential. In recent decades, microalgae have been used for the production of products in the areas of food, biofuels, animal food and pharmaceuticals [3,4]. The increase in demand for food,\nMar.

Drugs 2023, 21, 321 2 of 14\nenergy and materials has led to a fundamental role for microalgae as a raw material in the bioeconomy [5]. Current research trends for microalgae biomass have migrated from interest in biofuels to food supplements, sustainable production of microalgal biomass, biofertilizers, and bioremediation of water, soil and air [1,6]. The products that can be obtained from it have been firmly positioned among health foods known as \u201csuperfoods\u201d, which are \u201crich in bioactive compounds\u201d [7,8]. Microalgal biomass and its components, such as lipids, proteins, chlorophyll and amino acids, have acquired economic importance at the industrial level [9]. However, the cost of products derived from microalgae is still high; therefore, reducing production costs is a focal point of research. Currently, several production systems have been implemented to reduce costs, and these are validated using techno-economic analyses [10]. Microalgae are some of the main photosynthesizers of pigments at the industrial level, which gives them a high value in the world market of commercial pigments [11]. The most commonly used are blue-green microalgae (BGA) containing chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b [12]. The bioactive compounds with health benefits that can be obtained from microalgae include pigments such as carotenoids, chlorophyll, and phycobiliproteins, which have been studied for their anticancer, antioxidant, and antihypertensive properties [8]. Pigments are considered compounds of high value in the food sector because they are useful as food supplement promoters [13,14], due to their high nutritional value and competitive production cost [11]. Microalgae-based functional foods have not been exploited due to the high cost associated with microalgae harvesting, maintenance and extraction of their compounds of interest [8]; this cost is incurred because specific nutrients and equipment are required. For the production of microalgal biomass, alternatives must be sought in the cultivation system in order to reduce operating, input and maintenance costs [15]. The main challenges in cost reduction are correct selection of microalgae species, optimization of cultivation conditions, economically viable harvesting and high input costs [16]. To obtain high concentrations of biomass, heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth conditions are used, providing a source of organic carbon, in addition to synthetic mineral media that favor growth [17]. Microalgae can be grown under autotrophic, phototrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic culture conditions [18]. The most studied and conventional condition is phototrophic growth, which is used because it is relatively inexpensive; this is because it does not require a source of organic carbon, and with aeration, the microalgae obtain the carbon necessary for their proliferation and for the generation of pigments [13,19]. The growth conditions depend on the energy source (light) and the type of carbon needed (organic and inorganic) [13]. For phototrophic culture, a source of light energy (natural or synthetic) is necessary for the microalgae to photosynthesize; they must also have a source of inorganic carbon. In most cases, bubbling aeration is used, adding CO2 to the culture [20]. For heterotrophic culture, an organic energy source and an organic carbon source are required; in most investigations, glucose is used because it generates the least energy expenditure for the cells, and it is necessary that the culture is in total darkness [18]. For mixotrophic culture, the energy source must be a combination of organic and inorganic, and the carbon source must be organic and inorganic [18]. It has been reported that one of the advantages of using a heterotrophic culture is that it has a greater accumulation of lipids in the biomass, a high cell density, and the equipment design is simple, compared to phototrophic culture [20] (a type of culture highly used for the generation of biofuels). Regarding mixotrophic culture, it has been reported that a high cell density, prolonged growth, and a high concentration of pigments and proteins are achieved; these qualities are mainly utilized in the health sector [21,22]. The use of consortia of microalgae has been investigated in different fields of study. These consortia can be natural or artificial; natural consortia are found in combination with bacteria, while artificial consortia are composed of microalgae or microalgae with bacteria [23,24]. Natural consortia coexist, having a cooperative interaction between the mi-\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 321 3 of 14\ncroorganisms present [23]. Among the applications of these natural consortia are the bioremediation of soils with the use of biofertilizers, of air with the mitigation of atmospheric carbon, and of water with the removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, metallic contaminants, and organic load from all types of wastewater (industrial, dairy, domestic, etc.) [25\u201327]. At the end of the remediation process, the products obtained are the resulting treated water (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment) and the biomass of microalgae that can be used to obtain other compounds of interest [28]. It is essential that, according to the final use of the microalgal biomass production, an appropriate culture mode be selected so that the profitability of the process may be increased [18]. In addition, having a theoretical model of the production process facilitates techno-economic evaluation [4]. In this paper, the biotechnological potential of cultivating a natural consortium of regional microalgae to produce biomass and chlorophyll (a and b) under different growth conditions (phototrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic) in the cultivation stage is explored, based on experimental data and with the help of SuperPro Designer v10.0 software. A theoretical model was also developed as a design proposal for the microalgal biomass production, which allows technical and economic evaluation of the feasibility of the proposed process. Parameters such as energy consumption and operating costs were primarily evaluated."

According to the results of the simulation, 2177 units of 300 L are needed to cover 1 ha of the surface to be used as the cultivation stage, considering a feeding flow of 8160 L/h for the cases that consider 72 h as the residence time (cases F1, H1 and M1), and a feeding flow of 2040 L/h for the cases that consider 288 h (F2, H2 and M2). The annual biomass production estimated with the help of the simulator is shown in Table 1 and Figure 4 for all the study cases. The highest annual biomass production corresponds to the heterotrophic culture (H1); however, it is not the culture with the highest chlorophyll production, due to the low concentration obtained. The case of the mixotrophic culture (M1) has the second highest biomass production of all the cases, and even though the biomass concentration is not the highest, the chlorophyll production is higher than in the other cases.\nTable 1.

This is another factor with a high impact on the operating cost of the process, so it is necessary to seek to reduce this impact, either by evaluating the use of lower concentrations of the flocculant or by replacing it with one of lower cost and/or greater impact on the flocculation efficiency. However, the advantages that justify the use of chitosan in comparison with other organic and inorganic flocculants are its high biomass recovery, low contamination, no changes in the color of the microalgae, and no limitation of the recirculation of the culture medium [35]. In the second stage, the use of filtration technology was considered to concentrate the biomass to 200 g/L. This stage represents only 0.5% of the total operating costs of the process, of which 1.6% is due to the consumption of fresh water for washing the biomass, 0.8% is due to energy consumption, 6.1% is for labor, and 91.5% is associated with the costs associated with the facilities, such as equipment maintenance, among others. This technology has been compared in the literature with centrifugation (a widely used technique), and it has been shown that filtration has lower operating costs and lower energy consumption, saving 25\u201390% of energy [36,37].\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 321 8 of 14\nFinally, in the extraction stage, the wet biomass is mixed with the solvent and then the chlorophyll is separated using evaporation. This stage consumes only 1% of the operating cost of the entire process. Some 8.7% of the operating cost of this stage is due to the purchase of the solvent (methanol) necessary for the extraction, 17.42% is due to labor, 16.8% is due to energy consumption (34 kWh/year), chilled water (10,565 MT/year), steam (122 MT/year) and glycol as cooling agent (2080 MT/year), and 57.1% is included in the costs dependent on the facilities, which are mainly due to the maintenance of the equipment. For this study, the cost of the equipment proposed by the simulator was considered for the primary harvesting, secondary harvesting and extraction stages, with the exception of the cultivation systems, whose individual price was set at USD1712. The cost of the equipment is listed in Table 2. The simulator has a database of design parameters which are used in the equipment model to obtain the equipment purchase cost, and the SuperPro Designer v10\u00ae software uses the Chemical Engineering Cost Index to account for inflation to adjust the cost to different years (Intelligen, Inc., Scotch Plains, NJ, USA). Production costs are high when the extraction of compounds of interest from microalgae biomass is intended, and often, the production costs in bioprocesses are not competitive when compared with processes for the alternative production of synthetic compounds [4]. One of the main factors that increases the cost of microalgal biomass production is the use of bioreactors, since they are more expensive due to their complex construction and high energy consumption [38]. On the other hand, the cost of production will also depend on the scale of production; V\u00e1zquez-Romero [1] estimates that microalgal biomass could be produced for 108.26 or 44 EUR /kg DW, and the cost will depend on the scale of production, with 1 to 100 ha covered by culture in photo-bioreactor. In our case, the cost of producing microalgae biomass under the photobioreactor cultivation scheme covering 1 ha of culture surface, and from a consortium of microalgae, was USD47/kg of wet biomass. It is difficult to make a comparison between the different processes and their production costs, since the evaluations are carried out considering different parameters, and these depend on the type of microalgae for biomass production, the production scale, operating conditions, and nutrient consumption, among many others factors that cause great diversity in techno-economic evaluations. However, techno-economic analyses can be useful for assessing the commercial viability of any process, from microalgae culture to final product; they also help to establish the scale of any microalgae project/process, and to quantify the associated financial and technical risks. In this way, they are able to initiate an adequate strategy for the technical development of any process [38]."

For the simulation of this stage of the process, the preparation of the culture medium and the feeding of the airlift bioreactor were considered, using the data from the results of the experimental yields obtained in the first stage of the research. All simulation cases were evaluated in continuous operation mode, considering 330 days of annual operation [42]. To quantify the necessary bioreactors, it was considered that each one would cover an area of 4.6 m2 in order to make maximum use of sunlight in each one of them, and to avoid dark areas. Energy consumption by artificial light was not considered in the calculations, since it is considered that natural sunlight would be used. The total area to be covered by the cultivation stage was 1 ha, and each bioreactor has a maximum operating volume of 300 L. The objective of the second stage was to evaluate which culture system would achieve the highest amount of biomass and the highest potential for chlorophyll production in a continuous process.

The proposed stages are shown in Figure 8; the operating conditions were taken from experimental results in the laboratory and some others from the literature. Mar. Drugs 2023, 21, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 15\nFigure 8. Simulation of the biomass and chlorophyll production process of the microalgae consortium.\nOnce the biomass is produced in the culture, it is necessary to move on to the primary harvesting stage. For primary harvesting, flocculation of the biomass with chitosan (1 g/L in solution with acetic acid and water 20:80 v/v) was considered, achieving a biomass concentration up to 50 g/L and recovering 80% of the biomass at this stage. Subsequently, the biomass is passed through a filter press, after which the biomass is additionally washed with water to eliminate impurities; this stage concentrates the biomass up to 200 g/L, and 90% of the biomass is recovered [43]. This technology was selected for this stage because it has been reported, compared to other technologies, to achieve the same objective (e.g., centrifugation or vacuum filtration), i.e., a technology with lower operating costs [43]. Finally, the collected biomass passes to the extraction stage, where only the use of solvents for this purpose was analyzed. To this end, the biomass is mixed with methanol in a 2:1 v/v ratio (biomass: solvent) for 5 min (mixer residence time), and then the mixture is kept at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h without turbulent agitation. Once the 24 h residence time has elapsed, the mixture is separated and the organic phase (methanol + chlorophyll) is passed to an evaporator, where the solvent is removed at 60 \u00b0C before being recirculated to the process (Figure 8). This last stage of the research aims to evaluate the impacts of the various factors that affect the cost of chlorophyll production using a microalgae consortium."

This should therefore be evaluated in order to reduce the dosage and its effects on biomass harvesting, as well as its impact on operating costs. These two factors have the greatest impact on costs, and alternatives should be sought to reduce them, since the proposed process has great potential to be exploited. Additionally, we should look for alternatives to increase the production of biomass and chlorophyll from microalgae consortia, considering the technology has already been established in the process design; this would also help to improve the economics of the process by combining the use of biomass with the extraction of other compounds of commercial interest in a biorefinery scheme. Additionally, we should consider recycling the water obtained in the primary harvest, and consider it as a product that can be marketed and therefore contribute to improving the economy of the process.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.G.B.-S., E.M.V.-G. and C.A.C.-C.; methodology, C.A.C.-C. and O.S.C.-B.; software, E.M.V.-G. and M.A.P.-P.; validation, M.G.B.-S. and A.G.-L.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, C.A.C.-C. and E.M.V.-G.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.G.B.-S.; supervision, M.G.B.-S.
