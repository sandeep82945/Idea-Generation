Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of PR in this setting could inform policies to improve uptake. OBJECTIVE To estimate the cost-effectiveness of participation in PR after hospitalization for COPD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This economic evaluation estimated the costeffectiveness of participation in PR compared with no PR after COPD hospitalization in the US using a societal perspective analysis. A Markov microsimulation model was developed to estimate the costeffectiveness in the US health care system with a lifetime horizon, 1-year cycle length, and a discounted rate of 3% per year for both costs and outcomes. Data sources included published literature from October 1, 2001, to April 1, 2021, with the primary source being an analysis of Medicare beneficiaries living with COPD between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015. The analysis was designed and conducted from October 1, 2019, to December 15, 2021. A base case microsimulation, univariate analyses, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. INTERVENTIONS Pulmonary rehabilitation compared with no PR after COPD hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Net cost in US dollars, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS Among the hypothetical cohort with a mean age of 76.9 (age range, 60-92) years and 58.6% women, the base case microsimulation from a societal perspective demonstrated that PR resulted in net cost savings per patient of $5721 (95% prediction interval, $3307-$8388) and improved quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) (gain of 0.53 [95% prediction interval, 0.43-0.63] years). The findings of net cost savings and improved QALE with PR did not change in univariate analyses of patient age, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease stage, or number of PR sessions. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, PR resulted in net cost savings and improved QALE in every one of 1000 samples and was the dominant strategy in 100% of simulations at any willingnessto-pay threshold. In a 1-way sensitivity analysis of total cost, assuming completion of 36 sessions, a single PR session would remain cost saving to $171 per session and had an incremental costeffectiveness ratio of $884 per session for $50 000/QALY and $1597 per session for $100 000/ QALY. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this economic evaluation, PR after COPD hospitalization appeared to result in net cost savings along with improvement in QALE. These findings suggest that (continued) Key Points Question Among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) after COPD hospitalization cost-effective in the US health care system? Findings In this economic evaluation using data from published literature, a Markov microsimulation model found that PR after COPD hospitalization resulted in net cost savings. Meaning These findings provide evidence for stakeholders to use to support polices that will increase access and adherence to PR for patients with COPD. + Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.

Estimates of the cost-effectiveness of PR in this setting could inform policies to improve uptake.\nOBJECTIVE To estimate the cost-effectiveness of participation in PR after hospitalization for COPD.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This economic evaluation estimated the costeffectiveness of participation in PR compared with no PR after COPD hospitalization in the US using a societal perspective analysis. A Markov microsimulation model was developed to estimate the costeffectiveness in the US health care system with a lifetime horizon, 1-year cycle length, and a discounted rate of 3% per year for both costs and outcomes. Data sources included published literature from October 1, 2001, to April 1, 2021, with the primary source being an analysis of Medicare beneficiaries living with COPD between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015.

A base case microsimulation, univariate analyses, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed.\nINTERVENTIONS Pulmonary rehabilitation compared with no PR after COPD hospitalization.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Net cost in US dollars, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.\nRESULTS Among the hypothetical cohort with a mean age of 76.9 (age range, 60-92) years and 58.6% women, the base case microsimulation from a societal perspective demonstrated that PR resulted in net cost savings per patient of $5721 (95% prediction interval, $3307-$8388) and improved quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) (gain of 0.53 [95% prediction interval, 0.43-0.63] years). The findings of net cost savings and improved QALE with PR did not change in univariate analyses of patient age, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease stage, or number of PR sessions. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, PR resulted in net cost savings and improved QALE in every one of 1000 samples and was the dominant strategy in 100% of simulations at any willingnessto-pay threshold. In a 1-way sensitivity analysis of total cost, assuming completion of 36 sessions, a single PR session would remain cost saving to $171 per session and had an incremental costeffectiveness ratio of $884 per session for $50 000/QALY and $1597 per session for $100 000/ QALY.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this economic evaluation, PR after COPD hospitalization appeared to result in net cost savings along with improvement in QALE.

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is estimated to affect 24 million people in the US and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality of adults in both the US and across the globe.1-3 There are significant direct health system costs associated with COPD, namely an estimated $800 billion during the next 20 years.4 More than 25% of these costs are attributable to hospitalization for acute exacerbation of COPD,5 with one-quarter of these patients readmitted within 30 days.6\nPulmonary rehabilitation (PR) involves supervised instruction in exercise training, education, and behavioral change designed to improve physical function and change behavior.7 Participation in PR has been shown to relieve breathlessness, increase exercise capacity, and improve healthrelated quality of life in individuals with COPD.8,9 Furthermore, PR has been found to be associated with a significant reduction in hospital admissions and 1-year mortality after hospitalization.8,10 Despite consistent evidence of benefits in both randomized clinical trials8 and large observational studies,10,11 uptake of PR remains low.12 Lack of access to transport13 and copayments14 have been cited as major hurdles to uptake and adherence, whereas others have pointed to poor reimbursement as the critical barrier to broader use.15\nAlthough prior studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of PR outside the US,16-19 to our knowledge no estimates of the cost-effectiveness of PR in the US health care system have been published.7 Evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of PR within the US health care system would provide a strong justification to motivate the development of policies to improve use of PR. In this study, we compared the estimated effects of posthospitalization PR on cost and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in the US."

The Markov model itself has 3 states: alive during the first year after the index COPD hospitalization, alive during subsequent years, and dead. Although we used a lifetime time horizon, we assumed that (1) PR would only be performed within 90 days after the index admission; (2) PR would not continue beyond the first year; and (3) PR had no effects, either positive or negative, on cost or outcomes beyond the first year. During the first year, probabilities of readmission or death were conditioned on receipt of PR, as were costs associated with rehospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and skilled nursing facility (SNF) stays. Each individual \u201cpatient\u201d during the microsimulation was subject to an annual probability of readmission or death. We assumed that PR had no effects after the first year, which meant that subsequent mortality after the first year was dependent only on age, sex, and COPD disease stage defined by the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria.20 Data sources included published literature from October 1, 2001, to April 1, 2021, with the primary source being an analysis of Medicare beneficiaries living with COPD between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015 (mean age, 76.9 [range, 60-92] years; 58.6% women). The analysis was designed and conducted from October 1, 2019, to December 15, 2021. Markov cycles were 1 year in length, and costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3% annual rate.

We used reported estimates from the propensity-matched cohorts for 1-year mortality,10 hospital readmission,11 and number of days per person-year in the hospital, ED, or SNF for each group11; outcomes reported as rates (such as mortality and readmission) were converted to probabilities using standard methods.21 Conservatively, we did not model a dose-response with PR, although Lindenauer et al10 reported a statistically significant association between the number of completed sessions and mortality reduction. 1 \u2212 Mortality HR for pulmonary rehabilitation\nTo estimate QALE, we incorporated GOLD stage\u2013specific utilities derived from a previously published large multinational study22 that reported EuroQoL-5D scores derived from a US value set stratified by GOLD stage22 (Table 1). To account for PR participation population differences in utilities by GOLD stage, we used a published distribution of 30% for GOLD stage 2 (moderate), 48% for GOLD stage 3 (severe), and 22% for GOLD stage 4 (very severe).23 To account for the expected improvement in health-related quality of life associated with PR,8 we used a reported change in utility.24 Although prior studies have shown a negative correlation between utility scores and number of hospitalizations,25 we conservatively did not account for this potential additional benefit. To avoid potential underestimation of net lifetime cost attributable to COPD resulting from increased survival after PR, we included life expectancy after the first year posthospitalization using annual all-cause mortality stratified by age, sex, and GOLD stage (Table 1).20"

First, workforce participation among patients living with COPD is low31 because of age and/or symptoms, and productivity losses due to absenteeism4 or presenteeism32 among those who are employed are common. Although estimating mean wages among employed patients with COPD based on age, sex, and employment sector is theoretically possible, using these data without adjusting for the effects of the disease on productivity would lead to an overestimate of the actual cost. Second, even among patients with COPD who were employed at the time of an index hospitalization, the timing of a postdischarge return to work relative to beginning a PR program is unclear. As a surrogate for potential productivity losses due to either attending PR sessions or postdischarge health care encounters due to exacerbations of disease, we present estimates of the number of days spent undergoing PR and in the hospital, ED, or SNF for each strategy (Table 1).

Savings within the first year after the index hospitalization were $8226 (95% prediction interval, $5348-$10 873); the lower net savings over a lifetime of $5721 are due to higher survival with PR leading to greater longer-term COPD-related costs.

However, as of 2012, the estimated utilization rate for PR among Medicare beneficiaries was only 4%.12 In 2018, there were approximately 393 000 hospitalizations for COPD among Medicare beneficiaries,28 with at least one-quarter of these representing readmissions within 30 days after a prior discharge.6 Assuming 200 000 patients per year (consistent with the Medicare studies10,11) and our estimated savings of $5700 per patient, universal utilization of PR could result in savings for Medicare of $1 to $1.25 billion annually.\nWe were unable to identify any previously published cost-effectiveness analyses of PR for patients with COPD in the US health care system, although our findings are supported by numerous non-US studies (eTable 2 in the Supplement).16-19 A systematic review by Liu et al33 found that PR was cost-effective across a variety of settings, including outpatient and home-based rehabilitation and telerehabilitation.33 Although it is reassuring that these prior results are consistent with our present findings, our study has several important differences. In addition to including routinely reported costs of PR, rehospitalization, and ED use,17-19,34 we included the costs of SNF days, which to date have been reported infrequently (Table 1). In addition, we included data from multiple large data sources using clinical evidence,10,11 in contrast to most prior studies that used single-center clinical trial data.16,17,19\nAlthough Medicare will cover 1 lifetime PR program (36 sessions) as well as 1 additional program at the request of a physician (total of 72 lifetime sessions),35 only 4% of Medicare beneficiaries participate in PR,12 compared with 25% of patients with cardiac disease who participate in cardiac rehabilitation.36 Low reimbursement has been cited as one of the major barriers contributing toward low PR participation,15 and it is worth noting that reimbursement for PR ($44.52) is less than half that for cardiac rehabilitation ($92.84),15 despite comparable intensity of service and documentation.37\nFigure 2.

Furthermore, at a willingness-to-pay of $50 000/QALY, a standard for high-value interventions, PR would remain cost-effective until $884 per session (Figure 2). These findings illustrate the potential cost savings identified in our analysis, which could be used to address reported barriers to patient participation, such as higher reimbursement to support increasing PR building capacity in areas with low density of PR programs,38 facilitating patient transportation,13 and covering program copayments.14"

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. As with any model-based analysis, our results depend on the validity of the model structure; the validity, precision, and applicability of the data used for parameters; and the extent to which all plausible values and scenarios are explored in sensitivity analyses. Most of our estimates of resource utilization come from a large observational study of Medicare beneficiaries that used propensity weighting to account for differences between patients who did and did not use PR.11 Major exceptions were for estimates of the distribution of GOLD stages among PR participants23 and effect of PR on health-related quality of life,24 which came from European studies and may not be generalizable to the US population. We used probabilistic analysis to account for the precision of the estimate of reduction in rehospitalization using Medicare claims data,11 which itself was lower than the estimate in a recent Cochrane review based on predominantly Asian and European randomized clinical trials.8 In our base case analysis, we used the distribution of attended PR visits (mean of 9) rather than assuming universal completion of a full course of PR. Although this may underestimate cost compared with a full 36 sessions, it may also underestimate effectiveness, because there was a significant correlation between the number of sessions completed and survival.10 Whether the estimated cost savings or improvement in health-related quality of life and life expectancy would apply to younger patients, especially if productivity costs were included, is unclear. To the extent that PR reduces posthospitalization use of health care resources among younger patients who may be employed, it seems unlikely that any impact of PR on time away from work would not be mitigated by reductions in ED visits and rehospitalization. We used the most recent Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services pricing data available to generate national estimates, but because costs vary somewhat by region,27 we may have underestimated the cost of PR in specific locations. We did not validate our results because we are not aware of a readily available data set that would allow validation."
