We demonstrate that provided the Hurst parameter is chosen sufficiently small, this shift allows to establish well-posedness and stability to the corresponding problem \u2013 without the need of renormalization \u2013 in any dimension. We moreover provide a robustified Feynman-Kac type formula for the unique solution to the regularized problem building upon regularity estimates for the local time of fractional Brownian motion as well as non-linear Young integration.",

(1.1)\nAs it is well known, provided f and V are sufficiently smooth, we obtain the unique solution to the above problem via the Feynman-Kac formula\nu(t, x) = Ex [ f(Wt) exp ( \u2212 \u222b t\n0\nV (s,Wt\u2212s)ds\n)] ,\nwhere (Wt)t is a standard Brownian motion in Rd on a stochastic basis (\u2126,F ,P, (Ft)t) and Ex[(\u00b7)] denotes the expectation conditional on the Brownian motion starting in x \u2208 Rd. In the case of V enjoying only distributional regularity, this reasoning is no longer applicable. A famous example in this context is the continuous parabolic Anderson model (PAM)\n\u2202tu = 1\n2 \u2206u\u2212 \u03beu, u(0) = f, (1.2)\n*This project has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 754362 and No. 949981)\n\u2020Universit\u00e4t Bielefeld, E-mail: fbechtold@math.uni-bielefeld.de\nwhere \u03be is spatial white noise on Td or Rd. While in the case d = 1 (1.2) is still well posed due to the regularizing effect of the Laplacian, already d = 2, 3 require renormalization and the implementation of advanced tools from the theory of singular SPDEs such as regularity structures or paracontrolled distributions [28], [17], [18], [16], [1], [26, Example 1.21]. These approaches break down for d \u2265 4.\nIn the following, we intend to study evolution problems of the above form with a potential shifted along paths of fractional Brownian motion wH of Hurst parameter H, i.e.\n\u2202tu = 1\n2 \u2206u\u2212 V\u0303 u, u(0) = f, (1.3)\nwhere we denote V\u0303 (t, x) := V (x \u2212 wHt ) in case V enjoys sufficient regularity to admit pointwise evaluations or respectivelty V\u0303 (t, \u03d5) = \u3008V, \u03d5(\u00b7 + wHt )\u3009 for any smooth test function \u03d5 in case V only enjoys some distributional regularity. The study of (1.3) is motivated by its formal connection to transport noise perturbations of (1.1). Indeed, provided v solves\n\u2202tv = 1\n2 \u2206v \u2212 V v +\u2207v \u00b7 w\u0307Ht , u(0) = f, (1.4)\nthen formally, u(t, x) := v(t, x\u2212 wHt ) is a solution to (1.3). Conversely, given a solution u to (1.3), v(t, x) := u(t, x+ wHt ) formally solves (1.4)\n1. We show that by shifting the reference frame of the potential in such a way, we can restore well-posedness to (1.3) and obtain stability results even in the setting of distributional valued V . As an application, we establish well-posedness of a shifted parabolic Anderson model\n\u2202tu = 1\n2 \u2206u\u2212 \u03be\u0303u, u(0) = f (1.5)\nin arbitrary dimension, provided the Hurst parameter H is chosen sufficiently small. Towards this end, we exploit a pathwise regularization phenomenon on the level of the Feynman-Kac formula building mainly on [20]. More concretely, we establish in Lemma 2.2 below that for smooth potentials V , we may rewrite the Feynman-Kac formula for (1.3) as\nu (t, x) = Ex [ f(Wt) exp ( \u2212(IAt, )t )] , (1.6)\nwhere I denotes Gubinelli\u2019s Sewing operator2, At, the germ\nAt, s,r = (V \u2217 Ls,r)(Wt\u2212s),\nand L the local time associated with the fractional Brownian motion wH . Due to Young\u2019s inequality in Besov spaces, (1.6) might be well defined even for distributional potentials V , provided the local time L enjoys sufficient spatial regularity3. We therefore refer to (1.6) as a robustified Feynman-Kac formula. This main observation allows us to subsequently pass by a mollification argument: Given a distributional V , we consider first V smooth such that \u2016V \u2212 V \u2016H\u2212\u03b7 \u2192 0. For such V , we may express the unique solution u to the associated PDE as in (1.6) by Lemma 2.2. Next, in Lemma 2.4 we establish that due to the regularizing effect of the local time L, (u ) will converge in appropriate topologies to\nu(t, x) = Ex [ f(Wt) exp ( \u2212(IAt)t )] , (1.7)\n1We refer to [4], [31] where a similar transformation was employed to study regularization by transport noise for transport equations. Note that to make this connection rigorous, the main challenge consists in giving meaning to \u2207v \u00b7 w\u0307Ht , which is done in [4], [31] using higher order rough path theory (refer also to [8, Section 2.4], [3]).\n2Refer to [15] and Lemma 3.3 in the Appendix. 3This is precisely what [20, Theorem 3.1], also cited explicitly below, provides us with.\nECP 27 (2022), paper 47. Page 2/13\nhttps://www.imstat.org/ecp\nthat then becomes a candidate for a solution to (1.3). Notice that the expression V\u0303 u appearing in the equation is however a priori ill-defined. Yet, exploiting our explicit robustified Feynman-Kac representation (1.7), we can easily establish higher spatial regularity of u. In particular, we demonstrate that provided the initial condition f is chosen sufficiently smooth and H sufficiently small, u enjoys sufficient regularity for the product\nV (\u00b7)u(t, \u00b7+ wHt )\nto be well defined in the sense of Lemma 1.5 for any t \u2208 [0, T ]. Under these more restrictive conditions, we are thus able to identify (1.7) as a weak solution to (1.3)."

In particular the product V (\u00b7)u(t, \u00b7 + wHt ) is well defined for any t \u2208 [0, T ] in the sense of Lemma 1.5 and u is a weak solution to\n\u2202tu = 1\n2 \u2206u\u2212 V\u0303 u, u(0) = f (1.10)\ni.e. for any \u03d5 \u2208 C\u221ec (Rd) and t \u2208 [0, T ] we have\n\u3008ut \u2212 f, \u03d5\u3009 = \u222b t\n0\n\u3008us, 1\n2 \u2206\u03d5\u3009ds+ \u222b t 0 \u3008V (\u00b7)u(\u00b7+ wHs ), \u03d5(\u00b7+ wHs )\u3009ds.\nCorollary 1.2 (Regularized PAM). Consider spatial white noise on the d-dimensional torus Td. Its realizations are known to lie in H\u2212(d/2+ ) for any > 0 almost surely [34]. Hence, imposing H < 12 (1 + d)\n\u22121, we can apply the first part of our main result Theorem 1.1. Demanding further H < 12 (1 + d + dd/2 + 1/4e)\n\u22121, we may employ the second part, yielding a weak solution.\nRemark 1.3. Note that due to the robustness of our approach, several canonical extensions to the above statements follow readily mutatis mutandis: Instead of considering the Laplacian, more general non-degenerate diffusion operators can be considered in (1.10). Moreover, instead of shifting the potential V along paths of fractional Brownian motion, shifts along any path that admits a sufficiently regular local time are conceivable.\nRemark 1.4 (On uniqueness). By Theorem 1.1 the function u of (1.9) is independent of the sequence (V ) chosen to approximate the problem. We therefore obtain uniqueness of solutions to (1.10) in the class of functions that are limits of solutions to mollified problems of the form of (1.8). For a genuine uniqueness statement without this restriction, one could attempt to show that any solution to (1.10) admits the Feynman-Kac formula (1.9) along the lines of [25, Theorem 5.7.6] for example. Note however that since such\nECP 27 (2022), paper 47.

            "text": "The idea of employing a robustified Feynman-Kac formula in the study of heat equations with some form of multiplicative noise can be traced back to at least [30], [23], [22] for various types of space-time fractional Brownian motions. [21] combines these considerations with non-linear Young theory similar in spirit to the setting presented in this article. Remark however that our qualitatively different approach of considering random translations of the potential allows us to treat considerably more singular potentials. Furthermore, robustifications of the Feynman-Kac formula have been employed in the study of rough stochastic PDEs for example in [8, Chapter 12] or [7]. Regularization by additive noise for the multiplicative stochastic heat equation was recently established by [6] building upon ideas on pathwise regularization by noise in the spirit of [5], [10], [20]. Let us mention that this approach to regularization by noise has recently seen numerous applications for example to interacting particle systems [19], distribution dependent SDEs [12], [13] and multiplicative SDEs [11], [2]."

As a consequence, the only constraint on the Hurst parameter at this stage is H < 1/d, which simply assures the existence of a local time. In the following, we will impose further restrictions on the Hurst parameter, allowing to pass to less regular potentials V .\nBy the previous Lemma 2.2, we have that indeed u (t, x) = Ex [ f(Wt) exp ( \u2212 \u222b t\n0\nV (Wt\u2212s \u2212 wHs )ds )]\n= Ex [ f(Wt) exp ( \u2212(IAt, )t )] ,\nwhere At, s,u := (V \u2217 Ls,u)(Wt\u2212s).\nIn the next Lemma we address the question: Under which condition on V and H is it possible to pass to a limit \u2192 0?

Similar to the previous Lemma 2.2, we can conclude that indeed, At admits a sewing, since\n|(\u03b4At)s,u,r| = |V \u2217 Lu,r(Wt\u2212s)\u2212 V \u2217 Lu,r(Wt\u2212u)|\n.

We further demonstrate that (IAt)t admits exponential moments with respect to the measure P, allowing to establish well posedness of (2.3).

This shows that the function u in (2.3) is well defined as a function in C0([0, T ] \u00d7 Rd). Towards establishing convergence, let us first remark that similar to (2.4), we have |(IAt, )t| . 1 + c\u03b4(\u03c9) uniformly in > 0.

Moreover,\n\u03b4At,ns,u,r = n ((V \u2217 Lu,r)(Wt\u2212s + x+ 1/n)\u2212 (V \u2217 Lu,r)(Wt\u2212s + x)) \u2212 n ((V \u2217 Lu,r)(Wt\u2212u + x+ 1/n) + (V \u2217 Lu,r)(Wt\u2212u + x)) = (V \u2217DxLu,r)(Wt\u2212s + x)\u2212 (V \u2217DxLu,r)(Wt\u2212u + x) +O(1/n)|u\u2212 s|1+2\u03b4\n. c\u03b4(\u03c9)|r \u2212 u|1/2+\u03b4|u\u2212 s|1/2\u2212\u03b4/2 +O(1/n)|u\u2212 s|1+2\u03b4,\nmeaning that indeed supn \u2016\u03b4At,n\u20161+\u03b4/2 < \u221e, allowing to conclude (2.6) by Lemma 3.4. By the Fa\u00e0 di Bruno formula, we have\ndn dxn ( f(Wt + x) exp ( \u2212(IAt(x))t )) = exp ( \u2212(IAt(x))t\n) n\u2211 k=0 ( n k )( Dn\u2212kx f(Wt + x) ) Bk(\u2212(IDxAt(x))t, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 (IDkxAt(x))t),\nwhere Bk denotes the k-th complete Bell polynomial with the convention B0 = 1. Note in particular that (IDkxAt(x))t is uniformly bounded in space due to the regularity of the local time in this setting. Moreover, we have for any k \u2264 n the a priori bound\n|(IDkxAt(x))t| . (1 + c\u03b4(\u03c9)).\nECP 27 (2022), paper 47. Page 8/13\nhttps://www.imstat.org/ecp\nWe therefore have for any a > 0\n|Bk(\u2212D(IAt)0,t, . . . Dk(IAt)0,t)| . exp (ac\u03b3(\u03c9))\nwherefore dn dxn ( f(Bt + x) exp ( \u2212(IAt)0,t )) is well defined, uniformly bounded in x \u2208 Rd and integrable with respect to P. Overall, this allows to conclude that indeed u(t, \u00b7) \u2208 Cn for any t \u2208 [0, T ]. Finally, going through similar considerations for u and remarking that\n(IDkx(At \u2212At, (x)))t \u2192 0\nuniformly in t, x \u2208 [0, T ]\u00d7Rd, we infer that u (t, \u00b7)\u2192 u(t, \u00b7) in Cn uniformly in t \u2208 [0, T ].\nInvoking Lemma 1.5, we can now conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1 by observing the following: Corollary 2.6. Suppose H < 12 (1 + \u03b7 + d\u03b7e + d/2) \u22121, f \u2208 Cd\u03b7e and V \u2208 H\u2212\u03b7. Then for any t \u2208 [0, T ], the product\n\u3008(V\u0303 u)t, \u03d5\u3009 := \u3008V (\u00b7)u(t, \u00b7+ wHt ), \u03d5(\u00b7+ wHt )\u3009\nis well defined in the sense of Lemma 1.5. In particular, we infer that u is a weak solution to the original problem."

A comprehensive review paper on these topics is [14].\nDefinition 3.1. Let w : [0, T ]\u2192 Rd be a measurable path. Then the occupation measure at time t \u2208 [0, T ], written \u00b5wt is the Borel measure on Rd defined by\n\u00b5wt (A) := \u03bb({s \u2208 [0, t] : ws \u2208 A}), A \u2208 B(Rd),\nwhere \u03bb denotes the standard Lebesgue measure.\nThe occupation measure thus measures how much time the process w spends in certain Borel sets. Provided for any t \u2208 [0, T ], the measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on Rd, we call the corresponding Radon-Nikodym derivative local time of the process w:\nDefinition 3.2. Let w : [0, T ] \u2192 Rd be a measurable path. Assume that there exists a measurable function Lw : [0, T ]\u00d7Rd \u2192 R+ such that\n\u00b5wt (A) = \u222b A Lwt (z)dz,\nfor any A \u2208 B(Rd) and t \u2208 [0, T ]. Then we call Lw local time of w. Note that by the definition of the occupation measure, we have for any bounded measurable function f : Rd \u2192 R that\u222b t 0 f(ws)ds = \u222b Rd f(z)\u00b5wt (dz). (3.1)\nThe above equation (3.1) is called occupation times formula. Remark that in particular, provided w admits a local time, we also have for any x \u2208 Rd\u222b t\n0 f(x\u2212 ws)ds = \u222b Rd f(x\u2212 z)\u00b5wt (dz) = \u222b Rd f(x\u2212 z)Lwt (z)dz = (f \u2217 Lwt )(x).

Let 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1 < \u03b2. Then for any A \u2208 C\u03b1,\u03b22 (E), (IA) is well defined (we say that A admits the sewing (IA)).
