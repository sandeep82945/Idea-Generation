            "text": "Organic\u2013inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted intensive attention in the last few years due to outstanding photoelectric properties of perovskite semiconductor materials such as longer exciton diffusion length, higher absorption coefficient and easier tunable direct bandgap,1\u20133 which have promoted high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs to the current world record of 25.7% (ref. 4) based on a single junction device. Particularly, the perovskite light-absorbing layer attracts much attention by its simple and low-temperature fabrication technology.5\u20138 The crystal quality, surface morphology and grain size9,10 of a perovskite active layer is the key point for high-performance PSCs.11\u201313 There are many ways to optimize the crystalline process of a perovskite layer such as solution engineering,14 ion doping15 etc., which controls the crystallization of perovskite lm by modifying nucleation and growing-process are important measures toward achieving high quality perovskite lms.16,17 Nevertheless, the relationship between perovskite crystal dynamics and lm properties has not been thoroughly studied so far, especially the relationship between the electronic relaxation time of perovskite layer and device properties is also rarely studied.\nAs the light-absorbing layer of PSCs, perovskite layer plays a signicantly important role in the performance of devices. Several works have been published to highlight the contribution\nng, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang\ntion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nof central structure to the performance of PSCs. It is very effective to optimize central structure of devices by using doped semiconductor and nanometer material into the perovskite layer and transport layer.18\u201320 As examples, Liao group21 achieved a PCE of 19.49% by doping a 2D polymeric material of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) into the perovskite layer to reduce its intrinsic defect density. Wu et al.22 utilized the synergistic effect of H2O and DMF preparing a high-quality and large-area perovskite lm, which realized a high PCE of 20.1%. Chen et al.23 demonstrated the planar heterojunction solar cells with a PCE of 18.4% improved from 16.0% by presenting the Ag incorporated organicinorganic perovskite lms. Nucleation and crystal growth are the key factors in the controllable morphology of solution processed perovskite lm.24\u201326 In general, the growth of perovskite layer is dependent on precursor composition, solvent choice, deposition temperature and time, and so on, which is regarded as the fascinating role to improve the optoelectronic properties of PSCs.27,28 Especially, solvent engineering plays very effective role in the controllable growth of solution-processed crystalline lms. Moreover, due to the perovskite crystalline nature, the perovskite interfaces also inuence the device performance.29 In addition, less grain boundaries and thickness of perovskite layer are all also key elements contribute to high-efficiency PSCs.30\u201334 Large grains can improve the perovskite lm morphology and coverage effectively to reach an enhanced light-harvesting under unied light intensity.35\u201339\nThe studies of quantum dots modied PSCs mainly focused on the application of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) in devices, and the application of g-C3N4QDs in PSCs is rarely reported. Huang group40 have introduced CQDs with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on the surface into perovskite precursor solutions, where the functional groups interact with lead ions to\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 16935\u201316942 | 16935\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Compared to CQDs, g-CNQDs have abundant functional groups on their surface, which promotes the forming of intermediate phases in perovskite precursor solutions. By adjusting the concentration, the nucleation sites during the perovskite crystallization process can be controlled, thereby optimizing the quality of perovskite thin lms.\nThe graphene-like material was synthesized by hydrothermal method, and then its quantum dots were prepared by ultrasonic stripping. Herein, we fabricate the high-performance PSCs based on perovskite light-absorbing layer doped with Quantum Dots (QDs). The suitable doping of QDs increases perovskite crystallization grain size by hydroxylamine and carboxyl groups, which reduces intrinsic defect density by passivating the charge recombination centers around the grain boundaries. Moreover, the electronic relaxation time is reduced and the current density of the device is effectively improved. This results in a champion solar cell with a PCE of 20.07% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.93 mA cm \u22122, and a ll factor (FF) of 0.78."

Fig. 1b and c show the topview images of perovskite lms without and with g-C3N4QDs deposited on PEDOT:PSS layer coated on FTO glass by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. The increased interfacial contact angle shows highly hydrophobic of perovskite lm with g-C3N4QDs, which created by the ordering growth of perovskite grains based on the introduction of gC3N4QDs. Fig. 1c shows the size of perovskite cuboids increases with doping g-C3N4QDs and the morphology shows almost full surface coverage with larger grains in comparison with the control sample. Notably, both lms with different doping ratios of g-C3N4QDs have denser and better uniform morphology (Fig. S1a\u2013e\u2020). The decreases of pinholes avoid the direct contact between PEDOT:PSS and PCBM, which suppress the electrons recombined with the holes. Fig. 1d shows the XRD of perovskite lms based on g-C3N4QDs. It is obvious that the lms fabricated from perovskite solutions in the absence and presence of gC3N4QDs have a cubic perovskite phase with an almost unchanged crystal structure.

Fig. 1d shows the similar crystal structure exhibit in these lms, however, the difference is obvious in consideration of surface coverage and lm conformity, which are well known to be the most signicant parameters that affect device performance. Fig. 1e and f shows the AFM images of perovskite lms with and without gC3N4QDs incorporation. Compared to the pristine perovskite lm, obviously improvement in lm morphology was observed in g-C3N4QDs modied perovskite lms. The root-mean-square value of perovskite lm was determined to be 44.1 nm. It decreased to 29.3 nm aer incorporating g-C3N4QDs (30%). The inuence of other doping ratios on the surface morphology were shown in Fig. S1f\u2013j,\u2020 respectively.

Fig. 2b shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements to explore the recombination behaviors of photogenerated carriers in perovskite lms with and without gC3N4QDs. The normalized PL intensity increases with the doping of g-C3N4QDs, exhibiting the same tendency as the SEM results. This signies that an appropriate amount of g-C3N4QDs can render perovskite lms with reduced levels of nonradiative charge carrier recombination. The increased grain size and PL intensity of perovskite lm show g-C3N4QDs can passivate the negative defects in the polycrystalline perovskite lms. As a result, we believe that the proper amount of g-C3N4QDs addition is benecial to obtain perovskites with favorable grains and lower trap densities, and the crystallinity increased obviously to some extent, the suppression of charge carrier recombination and reduced number of defect sites grant positive effects to enhance device performance. To investigate the inuence of g-C3N4QDs on the electronic structure of perovskite lm, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to analyze the core levels of C/N/Br elements. As shown in Fig. 2c\u2013f, the XPS survey spectrum of g-C3N4QDs clearly presented three peaks with different binding energy of 287.2 and 398.2 eV, corresponding to the core level of C 1s and N 1s, respectively. It is obviously that the binding energy of C, N elements have no changed, the hydroxylamine and carboxyl groups in g-C3N4QDs made the stronger element content of the corresponding elements. However, obvious change of Br 1s was observed aer introducing g-C3N4QDs into the perovskite lm. In addition, the\n16938 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 16935\u201316942\nbromine line (Br 3d) was also detected by the high energy resolution of XPS. To better understand the inuence of gC3N4QDs doping on the Br 3d core level, the deconvolutions of Br 3d spectra in the perovskite lm was executed as shown in Fig. 2f. The Br 3d line can be resolved into two contributions, the Br 3d3/2 peak centered at 68.40 eV and Br 3d5/2 peak centered at 71.75 eV, implying the ionic state of Br in the sample. In addition, a shi was observed in the binding energies of the chemical states of Br 3d in the g-C3N4QDs modied perovskite lm. The shi toward lower binding energy caused by the reduction property of hydroxylamine group in the g-C3N4QDs. The low binding energy indicates the g-C3N4QDs provides charge to the perovskite, which show higher relaxation energy contributed to electron kinetic energy. The high electron kinetic energy helps to improve the charge mobility.\nFurthermore, ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was employed to study the in-depth charge transfer dynamics in the perovskite lms. By tracking the bleach recovery of the corresponding transitions, we can characterize the recombination of photogenerated carriers in perovskite lms. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, a broad negative absorption feature peaking at 740 nm is observed in both perovskite lm and doped g-C3N4QDs, nanowires, which is derived from the photogenerated electrons in perovskite lm. Themuch stronger negative absorption of g-C3N4QDs (30%) engineered perovskite lm suggests a higher concentration of photogenerated electrons.

Besides, the transient absorption intensity at 740 nm decreases from 1 ps to 8 ns via recombination with multiple time constants. The faster decline of charge concentration in engineered perovskite lm compared to control lm reveals that the electron decay process can be slowed in engineered perovskite lm. Moreover, the explicit expression for the electron decay kinetics at 740 nm is calculated in detail. Fig. 3c shows transient uorescence spectrum exported from TA curves, the tted time proles exhibit the delay time of engineered perovskite lm (1274.93 ps) longer than that for control lm (828.38 ps). Accordingly, the above results conrm that the introduction of g-C3N4QDs doping are favorable for the prolonged lifetime of photogenerated electrons. To uncover the effect of g-C3N4QDs on the electronic structures of perovskite, the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) of H was carried out. Fig. 3d shows the 1H-NMR of perovskite lms without and with g-C3N4QDs. The DMSO-d6 used as liquid-state NMR solvent can avoid the inuence of 1H-NMR signals of solvent on the samples.

The broad peak between 2 and 4 ppm belongs to MA of perovskite, the same downshi also reects the g-C3N4QDs induction as shown in Fig. 3f.\nThe current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristics of the fabricated PSCs are carried out under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight conditions, as shown in Fig. 4a. The device based on gC3N4QDs (30) shows a high PCE of 20.02%, with a Jsc of 25.93 mA cm\u22122, a Voc of 0.99 V, a FF of 0.78, and the PSC without the presence of g-C3N4QDs shows a PCE of 17.19%, with a Jsc of 23.95 mA cm\u22122, a Voc of 0.97 V, a FF of 0.74 (Table 1). Further increasing the g-C3N4QDs content deteriorates the device performance due to the reduced Jsc and FF. The increased Jsc benetted from reduced surface defects and enlarged grains, which indicates that a compact interface contact is assumed to be formed between perovskite layer and ETL This fact is favorable for the suppression of shunting paths in the device and benets the electron extraction, resulting in an enhanced FF. The increase in FF is primarily ascribed to the reduction of surface recombination and the enhancement of the charge collection efficiency. Fig. 4b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the reference and doped with g-C3N4QDs PSCs. It can be observed that EQE is improved all over the spectra from 300 to 850 nm in the g-C3N4QDs based PSCs.

The device with g-C3N4QDs (30) shows the slow decay compared to the control device under uninterrupted 120 hours testing process. The improved PCE stability in device with g-C3N4QDs (30) is considered of benets from suppressed surface recombination and higher charge collection efficiency.\nWe ascribed it to a passivation effect of g-C3N4QDs with at perovskite surface and good interface contact with upper layer component. Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) is an effective method to provide rich interfacial information such as contact resistance in multilayer devices. Fig. 4c gives the Nyquist plots of both devices in the dark at an applied voltage of 0.95 V. The series resistance (Rs), transport resistance (Rtr) and composite resistance (Rrec) could be extrapolated by employing an equivalent circuit model composing of Rs, Rtr, Rrec and parallel capacitor C. The Nyquist plots have two round arcs of devices without and with g-C3N4QDs. The modied device has a reduced radius of the rst round arc at high frequency, which demonstrates that g-C3N4QDs doping reduced the carrier\ntransfer resistance and optimized the contact interface. There are pretty clear differences between the second round arc at low frequency. The increased radius demonstrates that g-C3N4QDs doping enlarged the carries composite resistance, which means lower carries recombination loss. Fig. 4d shows the (J\u2013V) characteristics in the dark of devices without and with g-C3N4QDs in different proportions. The higher dark current density indicates more carriers in the region has been consumed by defects in the perovskite lm and device. The lower dark current density indicates g-C3N4QDs-passivation decreased the scattering centers of the carriers at the grain boundaries, thus, increased the Hall mobility of the carriers. The shi up of dark current density induced by more carries recombination with the increase of g-C3N4QDs doping density. To explore the formation of defects inuence on the performance of the solar cells, we conducted defect density measurement to understand what caused the degradation of devices under dark illumination. Fig. 4e shows trap energy level and the energetic prole of trap density of states (tDOS) of PSCs. It was found that g-C3N4QDs\n4QDs additive\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The reduction of deep traps can be explained by the reduction of amorphous regions during annealing, which benets from the forming of passivation interface doped with g-C3N4QDs. It is consistent with morphology study in terms of increased grain size during annealing.\nTo conrm the effect of g-C3N4QDs additive to the charge transporting of PSCs, the space charge limited current (SCLC) region can reect the efficient charge transfer of device. Fig. 4f shows the J\u2013V characteristics of perovskite lms without and with the g-C3N4QDs based on hole-only devices with a structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/Cs0.05FA0.92MA0.03PbI2.91Br0.09/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag. The hole-only devices were tested under the dark condition different from the optimized photovoltaic devices. The electron and hole mobilities (m) can be calculate according to Mott\u2013Gurney's equation as follows. Where the values of 30 (the vacuum permittivity) and 3r (material dielectric constant) are 8.8542 \u00d7 10\u221214 F cm\u22121 and 6.5, respectively, m is the electron/hole mobility and L is the perovskite layer thickness. Comparing to the control one, the hole mobility enhanced obviously by doping of g-C3N4QDs. The hole mobilities of devices based on perovskite and perovskite with g-C3N4QDs lms are calculated by the equation, which are 7.23 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 9.48 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm2 V\u22121 S\u22121 of perovskite with g-C3N4QDs lm, respectively.\nHigh-quality crystal in the perovskite lms is key to carriers transmission between each layer in good ohmic contact, as previously mentioned, which allows for a more smooth of intermolecular charge transfer and hence a higher charge carrier mobility. The results are accord well with the timeresolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (Fig. S2\u2020). Which shows comparation of with and without the g-C3N4QDs lms deposited on the electron-transporting layer. The PL decay spectra were tted into a biexponential decay function consisting of two times intervals, corresponding to a fast and a slow decay process. The fast decay process is associated with the quenching of free carriers in the perovskite domain through the charge transfer to the HTL, and the slow decay process is related to the radiative decay. The fast decay time indicating a chargetransfer dominant decay mechanism. Fig. S3\u2020 shows Hall effect measurement dependence of carrier density and Hall mobility of perovskite lm. The higher carrier density of perovskite-g-C3N4QDs lm benets from the compact and at surface. In addition, the Hall mobility in the perovskite-gC3N4QDs lm compared with the pristine perovskite lm exhibits a larger value. This means that g-C3N4QDs doped perovskite lm possess good conductivity, which enables corresponding PSCs to have a better device performance."
