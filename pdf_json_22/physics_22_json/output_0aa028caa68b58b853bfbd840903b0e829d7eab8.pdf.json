    "abstractText": "Differential settling and growth of dust grains impact the structure of the radiative envelopes of gaseous planets during formation. Sufficiently rapid dust growth can result in envelopes with substantially reduced opacities for radiation transport, thereby facilitating planet formation. We revisit the problem and establish that dust settling and grain growth also lead to outer planetary envelopes that are prone to compositional instabilities, by virtue of their inverted mean-molecular weight gradients. Under a variety of conditions, we find that the radiative envelopes of forming planets experience compositional turbulence driven by a semi-transparent version of the thermohaline instability (\u2019fingering convection\u2019). The standard double-diffusive thermohaline theory does not apply here and is replaced by a simplified first-principle treatment for the semi-transparent regime of interest. The compositional turbulence seems efficient at mixing dust in the radiative envelopes of planets forming at super-AU distances (say 5 AU) from a Sun-like star, but not so at sub-AU distances (say 0.2 AU). We also address the possibility of compositional layering in this context. Distinct turbulent regimes for planetary envelopes growing at sub-AU vs. super-AU distances could leave an imprint on the final planets formed.",

            "text": "The core accretion scenario is the leading theoretical framework to understand the formation of gaseous giant planets. In this scenario, a solid core accretes planetesimals and/or pebbles as it grows a massive gaseous envelope. Eventually, runaway gas accretion is triggered and a gas-dominated protoplanet is formed (Pollack et al. 1996; Papaloizou & Terquem 1999; Ikoma et al. 2000; Hubickyj et al. 2005; Rafikov 2006).\nPrior to the runaway gas accretion phase, it is possible to describe the protoplanet\u2019s structure via static or quasi-static models (Piso & Youdin 2014). The ability of the planetary envelope to cool then determines the pace of its evolution and growth, via a fundamental bottleneck set by Kelvin-Helmholz contraction (Piso & Youdin 2014; Lee & Chiang 2015). It depends on the magnitude of the opacity of the dust-loaded gas in the envelope, so that dust-rich envelopes, being more opaque, will cool and grow more slowly than less-opaque dustpoor envelopes. Dust opacity also determines the critical core mass above which runaway gas accretion occurs (Hori & Ikoma 2010; Brouwers et al. 2021).\nRecently, Ormel (2014) and Mordasini (2014) have emphasized how the dust that is continuously accreted together with the gas from a surrounding disk will settle and experience growth in the outer protoplanet radiative envelope. Both authors concluded that gaseous protoplanets could have envelopes that are considerably less opaque\nthan originally thought, as a result of the strong dust opacity reduction that follows from differential settling and grain size growth. This would facilitate planet formation by enabling faster Kelvin-Helmholz contraction of the gaseous envelope. It is this specific aspect of the core accretion scenario that we are revisiting in the present work.\nThe original core accretion scenario has been subject to many revisions and improvements over the years, in part to better address exoplanet discoveries. These revisions include a role for planet migration (Alibert et al. 2005), pebble accretion (Ormel & Klahr 2010; Lambrechts & Johansen 2012, 2014), continuous envelope replenishment (Ormel et al. 2015; Fung et al. 2015; Kurokawa & Tanigawa 2018), sandblasting in the convective interior (Ali-Dib & Thompson 2020) and various multi-dimensional effects typically ignored in idealized 1D models (B\u00e9thune & Rafikov 2019a,b). In this work, we isolate the dust accretion problem that we expect to be a generic feature of the scenario even in its revised formulations. We revisit the fate of the accreted dust, accounting for its settling and growth by following the static envelope formalism of Ormel (2014). Our main new finding is that the settling dust flow makes the outer protoplanet radiative envelopes unstable to a new form of thermohaline convection, so that planetary envelopes in formation may be the site of sustained compositional turbulence.\nIn \u00a7 2, we describe our planetary envelope models. In \u00a7 3 we discuss the thermohaline stability of these envelopes and the nature of\n\u00a9 0000 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n12 79\n7v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .E\nP] 3\n0 N\nov 2\nthe compositional turbulence that results.

For convenience, we solve Eq. 7 as an equation for the grain abundance \ud835\udc4dgr. For improved numerical convergence, we solve scaled versions of our equations and solve them in natural log radius space. For simplicity, we fix the inner radius of our domain at \ud835\udc5fin = 1.2 \u00d7 109cm for all our models. While this does not match the radius of the solid cores for the various masses that we explore, truncating or extending the inner radius of our solutions has little practical effect on our main conclusions, which are largely concerned with the outermost regions of the gaseous envelopes modeled (see below).\nAt the inner boundary, we impose \ud835\udc5agas = 0. We specify four outer boundary conditions, consisting of the dust mass accretion rate, \u00a4\ud835\udc40dep = \u00a4\ud835\udc40disk = 5\u00d710\u22129\ud835\udc40\u2295 yr\u22121, the grain abundance, \ud835\udc4dgr \u223c 10\u22122- 10\u22123 typically, and the gas temperature and density that match the disk values, \ud835\udc47disk, \ud835\udf0cdisk at the Hill radius (defined below).\nThe Hill and Bondi radii at semi-major axis \ud835\udc4e from a Sun-like star are given by\n\ud835\udc5fHill = 2 \u00d7 1011 \ud835\udc4e\n1AU \ud835\udc40\n1/3 1 cm (10)\n\ud835\udc5fBondi = 4 \u00d7 1010 ( \ud835\udc4e 1AU )1/2 \ud835\udc401 cm, (11)\nwhere \ud835\udc40core = \ud835\udc401\ud835\udc40\u2295 . We adopt MMSN values for the values of \ud835\udc47disk and \ud835\udf0cdisk imposed at the outer boundary, so that (Rafikov 2006):\n\ud835\udc47disk = 300 ( \ud835\udc4e 1AU )\u22121/2 K (12) \ud835\udf0cdisk = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 ( \ud835\udc4e 1AU )\u221211/4 g cm\u22123. (13)\nWe solve our ODE system using the Dedalus platform (v2, Burns et al. 2020), using the nonlinear boundary value problem solver. All problem variables are transformed into their natural logarithm, except for \ud835\udc5agas. Our implementation of approximate differentiable versions of the min and max operators is described in Appendix A.\nUnlike Ormel (2014), none of our models has planetesimals contributing as a source of dust within the gaseous envelope, since this\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (0000)\nfeature is not essential to our main argument. In our models, planetesimals only power the core luminosity, \ud835\udc3f, that is conserved and transported through the gaseous envelope. Rather than fixing the core luminosity, we adopt fixed values of \u00a4\ud835\udc40core/\ud835\udc5fcorein our models, with \u00a4\ud835\udc40core = 0.2 \u00d7 10\u22125\ud835\udc40\u2295 yr\u22121 and \ud835\udc5fcore = \ud835\udc5fin = 1.2 \u00d7 109cm. This implies that the core accretion luminosity simply scales linearly with \ud835\udc40core. We have verified that different core radii/luminosities change details of the gaseous envelope structures but do not have a strong impact on our main conclusions, which rely on the qualitatively robust inverted mean molecular weight gradients realized in the outer envelopes, as we now describe."

We have also surveyed a larger parameter space by building proto-planetary models over a range of semi-major axes (0.2\u2212 5AU), core masses (0.2\u2212 5\ud835\udc40\u2295) and boundary value for the grain abundance \ud835\udc4dgr (10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22124). Representative examples of the envelope structures and the corresponding dust properties across this parameter space are shown in Fig. 1.\nIn all our models, we find that the imposed value of \ud835\udc4dgr quickly relaxes to a bulk value for the envelope (see also Mordasini 2014) over a narrow dust adjustment layer close to the model outer boundary. As mentioned by Ormel (2014), dust processing likely happens in the disk itself. As a result of this edge adjustment, the specific value of \ud835\udc4dgr imposed at the outer boundary is not particularly important to our analysis.\nBy contrast, a slowly decreasing value of \ud835\udc4dgr with decreasing radius in the envelope\u2019s bulk is found to be present in all our envelope models, as long as the value of \ud835\udc4dgr imposed at the outer boundary is large enough (\u223c 10\u22122-10\u22124). This positive \ud835\udc4dgr gradient in the bulk of the outer envelope is important since it corresponds to a mean molecular weight of the dust-loaded gas\n\ud835\udf07dg = \ud835\udf07gas \ud835\udf0cgas + \ud835\udf0cgr\n\ud835\udf0cgas = \ud835\udf07gas (1 + \ud835\udc4dgr) (14)\nthat is increasing with radius within the envelope (see the slanted black lines in the right panels of Fig. 1). The resulting meanmolecular weight gradient is given by \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf07dg \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udf07gas \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4dgr \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f , (15)\nwhich is positive. The dust-loaded gas is thus susceptible to compositional instabilities, by virtue of the heavier fluid sitting on top of lighter fluid in the gravitational acceleration field. We perform a detailed stability analysis of our model envelopes across the parameter space surveyed in the next section."

The nature of this boundary adjustment layer depends strongly on the choice of \ud835\udc4dgr imposed at the outer boundary. The compositional turbulence that would develop from such Ledoux-unstable conditions would presumably efficiently mix composition to more gradually match the\nconditions present in the disk, but we have not pursued this issue further since it also depends on the possibility of dust processing within the disk itself, which is beyond the scope of our present work.

We have verified that these milder, radially extended \ud835\udf07-gradients are consistently weak-enough to be Ledoux stable.

We evaluate simply \ud835\udf08 ' \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc50gas, where \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc54 is the H2 gas mean free path and \ud835\udc50gas the sound speed (Menou 2019). We return to the issue of the dust compositional diffusivity in more detail in Appendix B, where we describe how Brownian motion acts more slowly than viscosity in the present context and we briefly consider the possibility of dust settling within a slowly growing thermohaline finger as an additional relevant process.\nOver the parameter space of interest to us here, for protoplanetary cores with masses in the range 0.2-4.75 MEarth, located from 0.2 to 5 AU from a Sun-like star, we find typical values of the thermal diffusivity \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc47 in the range 1011-1018 cm2 s\u22121 and of the kinematic viscosity \ud835\udf08 in the range 102-106 cm2 s\u22121. for the outer radiative envelopes.

(2013) to describe the double-diffusive thermohaline instability. In particular, the thermohaline regime of instability can be inferred from a unique number, the \u2019density ratio\u2019\n\ud835\udc450 = \u2207 \u2212 \u2207ad \u2207\ud835\udf07 > 0 (17)\nwhich compares the magnitude of the stabilizing entropy gradient (numerator) to that of the destabilizing compositional gradient (denominator).

Unstable thermohaline modes exist when 1 < \ud835\udc450 < 1/\ud835\udf0f (Brown et al. 2013), where the diffusivity ratio \ud835\udf0f = \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07/\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc47 . Its value is set to that of the Prandtl number \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f in our analysis, since we adopt \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 = \ud835\udf08 as a default (see Appendix B for a relaxation of this assumption).\nIn the bulk outer regions of our proto-planetary envelopes, we find values of \ud835\udc450 typically ranging from 101 to 105, which satisfy the condition 1 < \ud835\udc450 < 1/\ud835\udf0f(= 1/\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f).

In each\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (0000)\npanel, the blue dash-dotted lines show the local pressure scale height, computed as \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc45gas\ud835\udc47/\ud835\udc54, as a function of logarithmic radius in the gaseous envelope above the inner solid core. The dashed orange lines show the mean-free path of thermal photons\n\ud835\udf06mfp = 1\n\ud835\udf0cgas\ud835\udf05 . (18)\nThe dotted green lines show the typical length-scale for doublediffusive thermohaline fingers, as described in Brown et al. (2013),\n\ud835\udc51fing =\n( \ud835\udf08\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc412th\n)1/4 , (19)\nwhere the (squared) thermal contribution to the Brunt-Vaissala frequency is defined as\n\ud835\udc412th = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f)2 \ud835\udc45gas\ud835\udc47 (\u2207ad \u2212 \u2207) . (20)\nIn all cases considered in this work, we find that the thermohaline finger scale is \u223c 1-3 orders of magnitudes smaller than the thermal photon mean-free path, so that thermohaline fingers are expected to be transparent with respect to the ambient thermal radiation field. This situation is reminiscent of double-diffusive shear instabilities in hot Jupiter atmospheres (Menou 2021) and therefore calls for a generalization of the thermohaline theory to the semi-transparent regime. Borrowing from our work on hot Jupiter atmospheres, we generally expect the gravest (most unstable) thermohaline mode to develop on the largest possible scale (so as to minimize the dampening effect of viscous and/or compositional microscopic diffusion) that is also able to offer as short a cooling time as possible (to help neutralize the otherwise stabilizing effect of the thermal stratification in the radiative envelope). Therefore, much like the argument developed in Menou (2021), this leads us to posit that the largest scale offering the shortest cooling time is found right at the opacity transition scale, where the medium transitions from being transparent to being opaque. Using the definition of Spiegel (1957) for the cooling time in the optically thin regime, we have:\n\ud835\udf0fthin = \ud835\udc36v\n16\ud835\udf05\ud835\udf0esb\ud835\udc473 , (21)\nwhere \ud835\udc36v is the gas heat capacity at constant volume. We infer a typical scale for the gravest mode in the semi-transparent regime\n\ud835\udf06gravest = (\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udf0fthin)1/2 , (22)\nobtained by equating the radiative diffusion time on that scale to \ud835\udf0fthin. The corresponding scale for the gravest semi-transparent thermohaline mode is shown as a solid red line in Fig. 2, capped to the maximum value of the local radius \ud835\udc45. Alternatively, one could limit the gravest mode scale to the local pressure scale height, \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc5d , wherever \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc5d < \ud835\udc45. As expected from our various definitions, the gravest mode scale is nearly equivalent to the thermal photon mean free path defined in Eq. (18), shown as dashed orange lines in Fig. 2.\nIn Menou (2021), several criteria were discussed for the onset of semi-transparent shear instabilities, such as the requirement \ud835\udf0fthin < \ud835\udf0fbuoy = 1/\ud835\udc41th or the Moore-Spiegel criterion requiring \ud835\udf0fthin < \ud835\udf0fMS where\n\ud835\udf0fMS = 1\n\ud835\udc45 1/2 0 \ud835\udc41th\n, (23)\nonce we adapt the definition of \ud835\udf0fMS to account for the destabilizing mechanism being the unstable molecular weight stratification here, rather than the shear. This expression for \ud835\udf0fMS follows from replacing\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (0000)\nthe shear rate \ud835\udc46 by the compositional contribution to the BruntVaissala frequency, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udf07 , and using the definition of \ud835\udc450 in Eq. 17.\nFigures 3-5 show various timescales of interest for this study, for a range of protoplanetary core masses (0.2-4.75 MEarth) located at 0.2 AU (Fig. 3) , 1 AU (Fig. 4) and 5 AU (Fig. 5). In each panel, the red solid line shows the transparent cooling time \ud835\udf0fthin as a function of logarithmic radius above the solid core boundary. For comparison, the buoyancy time \ud835\udf0fbuoy = 1/\ud835\udc41th and the Moore-Spiegel time \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc46 are also shown as dotted green and dash-dotted blue lines, respectively.\nIn Menou (2021), when discussing semi-transparent shear instabilities, the Moore-Spiegel time was adopted as the instability threshold, requiring that \ud835\udf0fthin < \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc46 for secular shear instability to occur. As we see from Figs 3- 5, following the same logic would suggest that proto-planetary envelopes at 0.2 AU will not be subject to semitransparent thermohaline instabilities, while the outermost regions of proto-planetary envelopes may be unstable at 1 AU and even more so at 5 AU. This type of qualitative reasoning on the instability criterion was necessary for shear instabilities, because of their sub-critical nature, i.e. absent a well-defined linear stability criterion. By contrast, a more robust, quantitative answer can be obtained for thermohaline instabilities since they are amenable to linear stability analysis.\nMore specifically, we assume that the double-diffusive linear stability analysis of Brown et al. (2013) for thermohaline modes remains marginally valid right at the opacity transition scale, which is the scale at which we expect the gravest mode to grow in the semi-transparent thermohaline regime. The reasoning behind this approach is as follows. Perturbations on scales larger than the opacity transition scale behave as optically-thick while perturbations on smaller scales have a transparent behaviour. The effective cooling time is continuous across those scales and asymptotes to the value \ud835\udf0fthin for small transparent scales. As a result, we conjecture that there are marginally opaque scales that thermally respond in a way that is similar to the behaviour of transparent scales, so that the optically-thick linear theory remains indicative of the behaviour to be expected at the opacity transition scale. This assumption will need to be formally evaluated in the future with dispersion relations for thermohaline modes in the transparent and semi-transparent regimes.\nAdopting this marginal validity assumption, we solve the 3rd-order dispersion relation of Brown et al. (2013) \u2013 their Eq. 19 \u2013 for our identified gravest mode, with a length scale \ud835\udf06gravest, keeping in mind that this approach pushes the limit of a linear theory that was formally derived in the double-diffusive (optically-thick) regime. In practice, we solve the corresponding third-order polynomial with a standard python package (numpy.roots) and identify the largest real root as the growth rate of our gravest mode.\nThe resulting growth time for the gravest mode, \ud835\udf0ffgw (the inverse of the growth rate), is shown as a dashed orange line in each of the panels of Figs 3-5. In all cases, this growth time is rather slow, as expected for a large finger with a length-scale that is well in excess of the characteristic double-diffusive scale (see Fig. 2 again). Notably, the growth time for this gravest mode exceeds the transparent cooling time \ud835\udf0fthin (red lines in Figs 3-5) by several orders of magnitude typically.\nContrary to our initial expectations, our dispersion relation approach also indicates that the relative scaling of \ud835\udf0fthin with respect to \ud835\udf0fbuoy and \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc46 has little noticeable impact on the growth time of the gravest semi-transparent mode, in the sense that unstable semitransparent thermohaline modes exist even when \ud835\udf0fthin > \ud835\udf0fbuoy or \ud835\udf0fthin > \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc46 . 1 It will be important to confirm these results in the\n1 As a corollary, these linear stability results for thermohaline modes sug-\nfuture with dispersion relations for thermohaline modes explicitly derived for the transparent and semi-transparent regimes.\nEquipped with estimates of the gravest mode length-scale and growth rate, we can evaluate at linear order the magnitude of the thermohaline transport/mixing of mean-molecular weight inhomogeneities that is expected to result from this thermohaline turbulence. For this, we evaluate a thermohaline turbulent diffusivity as\n\ud835\udc37mix ' \ud835\udf062gravest/\ud835\udf0ffgw (24)\ngest that semi-transparent shear instability might exist beyond the qualitative instability criteria used in Menou (2021), which would imply that turbulent vertical transport may be even more prevalent than discussed in that work.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (0000)\nand the corresponding local mixing time at radius \ud835\udc45 in the envelope as\n\ud835\udf0fmix (\ud835\udc45) ' \ud835\udc452/\ud835\udc37mix (25)\nProfiles of thermohaline mixing times \ud835\udf0fmix are shown as solid yellow lines in each of the panels of Figs 3-5. For comparison, the growth and settling times for dust, \ud835\udc47grow and \ud835\udc47settl = \ud835\udc45/\ud835\udc63settl respectively, are also shown as grey and black dash-double-dotted lines in Figs 3-5. In regions where \ud835\udf0fmix < \ud835\udc47settl and < \ud835\udc47grow, we expect any dust abundance gradient to be flattened (mixed) by thermohaline turbulence. 2 As can be seen from comparing the settling vs. mixing profiles for various protoplanetary core masses and locations in Figs 3-5, we find that thermohaline turbulence is present in all cases modeled but the resulting mixing operates faster than dust settling (and growth) only at 5 AU distances, with marginal competition between these two processes at 1 AU. The mixing is comparatively inefficient at 0.2 AU (\ud835\udf0fmix > \ud835\udc47settl).\n2 Dust settling is often faster than growth in the bulk of radiative envelopes modeled here, except for edge effects that we neglect\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (0000)"

            "text": "We can push further our use of the double-diffusive thermohaline theory for the semi-transparent regime by considering the issue of compositional layering. It has been suggested that a compositionally turbulent medium driven by thermohaline instabilities could develop compositional layers via a collective instability when the Stern number is above unity. Following Brown et al. (2013), we compute profiles of the Stern number \ud835\udc34 for our model envelopes, using the definition for the Stern number in their Eq. (42).\nThe corresponding profiles of Stern numbers are shown in Fig. 6 for our various protoplanetary envelope models, lined up on a common logarithmic radius grid. If we exclude nearly vertical regions of these profiles near the outer boundary, which again are caused by Ledoux-unstable edge effects, we find that the various red profiles (corresponding to various core masses located at 5 AU) admit extended outer radiative regions with Stern number \ud835\udc34 > 1, while the blue profiles (for protoplanetary cores at 0.2 AU) do not. This indicates that the conditions for compositional layering from thermohaline turbulence are preferentially met in the radiative envelopes of protoplanets forming at super-AU distances, and perhaps marginally so at 1 AU.\nWhile this indicates that a different turbulent regime maybe realized at sub-AU vs super-AU distances, one needs to remain cautious about how to interpret these results. Our understanding of the compositional layering process remains limited (Garaud 2018). In the specific numerical investigation of Brown et al. (2013), for example, layering appears only for Stern numbers exceeding 100 \u2212 1000, for reasons that remain unclear and may have numerical or physical origins, given the challenge of robustly simulating the various scales involved in the turbulent thermohaline problem. It remains to be seen under what conditions and to what extent compositional layering can be achieved in a semi-transparent medium."

            "text": "We have shown that the outer radiative envelopes of gaseous planets in formation are prone to compositional instabilities, from the\ninverted mean-molecular weight gradients that develop in their dustloaded gas. Under a variety of conditions, we find that the radiative envelopes of forming planets are thus subject to compositional turbulence driven by a semi-transparent version of the thermohaline instability (\u2019fingering convection\u2019). This compositional turbulence could efficiently mix dust in the envelopes of planets forming at super-AU distances from Sun-like stars, but the mixing would not be efficient at sub-AU distances. We also find that compositional layering resulting from a collective instability in the turbulent layers is favoured at large (super-AU) distances.\nThere are various potential consequences of these results that are worth considering, even if they cannot be fully elucidated yet. In evolutionary terms, going beyond static envelope models, it seems that the constant influx of dust-loaded gas and the dust subsequent processing in radiative envelopes will generate turbulence for planets at various stages of their formation history, since our results hold over a large range of core masses.\nCompositional turbulence driven by double-diffusive processes is expected to be relatively mild compared to any dynamically-driven turbulence, e.g. turbulent convection in the interior. This might be important in determining whether the compositional turbulence is strong enough to have collisional velocities that would lead to the fragmentation of dust grains. We can estimate typical collisional velocities in the compositional turbulence by using the properties of the gravest unstable mode: vcoll \u223c \ud835\udf06gravest/\ud835\udf0ffgw is typically less than 10 cm s\u22121. Furthermore, dust relative velocities may be even lower than this estimate given that the dust stopping time is short relative to \ud835\udf0ffgw, implying fairly coherent dust motion within the turbulent fluid. This suggests that systematic collisional grinding is not expected in the compositional turbulence of interest here (unlike the convective interior, Ali-Dib & Thompson 2020).\nAssuming no collisional fragmentation occurs, the main effect of compositional turbulence would then be its tendency to mix the larger (processed) dust grains found at depth with the smaller (unprocessed) dust grains found further out in the envelope. We expect mixing in the thermohaline-unstable region to combine with additional (stronger) mixing in the Ledoux-unstable border region. 3 This composite mixing by compositional turbulence will act to eliminate the original instabilities driving the turbulence and should thus flatten the grain abundance profile in the outer planetary envelope. This would tend to also flatten the closely related opacity profile of the outer envelopes (see Fig. 1, black and pink solid lines) and, if strong enough, could potentially counter the opacity reduction effect emphasized by Ormel (2014) and Mordasini (2014). A quantitative evaluation of these effects will likely require solutions to an advection-diffusion equation for the dust-grain population. We note, as a further consequence, that more opaque envelopes would build up mass at slower rates. Our results thus suggest the possibility of comparatively faster planet formation at sub-AU distances than at super-AU distances, although it is clear that other effects not accounted for in our work can greatly impact the ability of any forming planet to grow its gaseous envelope (e.g., Ormel et al. 2015).\nThe consequences of compositional layering, if it happens, are somewhat unclear. It would presumably impact envelope cooling by reducing heat transport, which would further slow down the gaseous envelope buildup. One also wonders whether the compositional layers could survive the later stages of planet formation (e.g. the fast runaway gas accretion stage) and become permanent features of the\n3 We note that collisional fragmentation may be more likely to happen in Ledoux-unstable regions.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (0000)\nfinal planetary envelopes thus formed. Compositional layers have been proposed to better explain the structure and evolution of Solar System and extrasolar gaseous planets (Leconte & Chabrier 2012, 2013) but their origin remains unclear (see also Fuentes et al. 2022).\nFinally, we note that forming planets are expected to rotate fast from the buildup of angular momentum that comes with the gas being accreted (B\u00e9thune & Rafikov 2019a,b). Interestingly, Sengupta & Garaud (2018) have studied the role of rotation on thermohaline modes and compositional turbulence and have pointed out that rotation may strengthen thermohaline instabilities by limiting the transverse shear instabilities that are thought to saturate the growth of thermohaline fingers.\nThese various points suggest that there are several interesting avenues of exploration going beyond our first-level analysis that will be important to develop a better understanding of the role of compositional turbulence in the gaseous envelopes of forming planets.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe data underlying this article will be shared on reasonable request to the corresponding author (KM)."

Following Blum et al. (1996), we estimate the dust compositional diffusivity as\n\ud835\udf05brown = \ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udf0ff, (B1)\nwhere \ud835\udc5a is the dust grain mass and \ud835\udf0ff is the dust friction time. For a concrete estimate, we adopt conditions relevant at 1 AU in the protoplanetary disk and assume the Epstein drag regime for micron-sized dust grains is relevant, leading to \ud835\udf0ff \u223c 2.5s (Armitage 2007). Using the Epstein formulation for drag, we can rewrite the compositional diffusivity as\n\ud835\udf05brown ' \ud835\udc50gas\ud835\udf07gas\ud835\udc5aH\ud835\udc60\u22122\ud835\udf0c\u22121gas (B2)\n' 0.05 cm2 s\u22121\nfor a representative sound speed \ud835\udc50gas = 2.4\u00d7 105 cms\u22121, a grain size \ud835\udc60 = 10\u22124cm and a representative gas density \ud835\udf0cgas = 5\u00d710\u221210 g cm\u22123. This low-level of diffusivity is further reduced for larger grain sizes and high gas densities.\nTherefore, the diffusivity from Brownian motion evaluates to rather small values of \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 , typically much less than the kinematic viscosity \ud835\udf08 for the outer radiative envelopes modeled here (with larger densities found in the gravitationally bound envelopes).\nAnother potentially relevant process in this context is the possibility that differential settling operates within a compositionally unstable flow. Adopting as a guide the idealized view of nearly-linear thermohaline fingers growing slowly enough that settling happens\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (0000)\nwithin them, we might expect the dust to drift with respect to the gas, so that some dust exchange between the fingers and their environment occurs. It will likely not act like a diffusion process in modifying dust inhomogeneities, given that the settling is a one-directional process driven by gravity. Nonetheless, we can estimate the magnitude of this effect by computing an effective \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 for this dust drift process as the product of the settling velocity with the thermohaline finger size\n\ud835\udf05settl \u223c \ud835\udc63settl\ud835\udc51fing ' \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc51fing \ud835\udc47settl . (B3)\nThis evaluates to \ud835\udf05settl \u223c 1010 cm2 s\u22121 for representative values of \ud835\udc45 = 1011 cm, \ud835\udc47settl = 1011 s and \ud835\udc51fing \u223c 0.1 \ud835\udc45 (see Fig. 2). We thus obtain values of \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 which are considerably larger than those for Brownian motion and potentially well in excess of the gas kinematic viscosity \ud835\udf08.\nGiven the large range of possible values for \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 suggested by the above estimates, we generalized our thermohaline stability analysis to cases with different values of \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 , both smaller and larger than the default \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 = \ud835\udf08 adopted in the main text. Reassuringly, we have recovered nearly identical results to our dispersion relation solutions for the fastest growing mode (\u00a7 3.3), both for \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 << \ud835\udf08 and for \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 > \ud835\udf08, as long as \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 does not exceed 103-104 \u00d7 \ud835\udf08. In other words, our results are not significantly impacted as long as the condition \ud835\udc450 < 1/\ud835\udf0f for thermohaline instability is well satisfied.\nThis leads us to conclude that our results are robust to the poorly constrained value of \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 , as long as it does not exceed the gas kinematic viscosity \ud835\udf08 by several orders of magnitude. This explains our use of \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf07 = \ud835\udf08 as a reasonable default in the main text. However, it is clear that further work, possibly via numerical simulations of the thermohaline instability in a dust-loaded gas, are needed to clarify how efficiently dust inhomogeneities are modified by the process of settling in fully develop compositional turbulence.\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX file prepared by the author.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (0000)"
