 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the Digital Mandala app in reducing depressive symptoms compared to a control group. This would provide stronger evidence for its effectiveness.

2. Examine which specific data factors (e.g. color choices, rotation direction) are most predictive of depression levels based on analysis of usage data. This could allow for more personalized feedback and recommendations.

3. Investigate the optimal duration and frequency of Digital Mandala use needed to achieve significant reductions in depressive symptoms. This could inform dosage recommendations. 

4. Develop and test enhanced versions of the Digital Mandala app, such as adding social features for peer support or including therapist guidance. This could potentially increase engagement and outcomes.

5. Conduct qualitative research through interviews or focus groups to understand user experiences and identify ways to improve the quality, appeal and therapeutic value of the Digital Mandala app. This could aid refinement of the app.
