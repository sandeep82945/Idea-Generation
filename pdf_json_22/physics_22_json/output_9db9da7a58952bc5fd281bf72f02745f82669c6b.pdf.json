    "abstractText": "The theory of electrokinetic ion transport in cylindrical channels of a fixed surface charge density is revisited. Attention is focused on impact of the hydrophobic slippage and mobility of adsorbed surface charges. We formulate generalised Onsager relations for a cylinder of an arbitrary radius and then derive exact expressions for the mean electro-osmotic mobility and conductivity. To employ these expressions we perform additional electrostatic calculations, with the special focus on the non-linear electrostatic effects. Our theory provides a simple explanation of a giant enhancement of the electrokinetic mobility and conductivity of hydrophobic nanotubes by highlighting the role of appropriate electrostatic and hydrodynamic length scales and their ratios. We also propose a novel interpretation of zeta potentials of cylindrical channels.",

Silkina,1 and Evgeny S. Asmolov1\n1Frumkin Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry,\nRussian Academy of Sciences, 31 Leninsky Prospect, 119071 Moscow, Russia\n(Dated: November 10, 2022)\nThe theory of electrokinetic ion transport in cylindrical channels of a fixed surface charge density is revisited. Attention is focused on impact of the hydrophobic slippage and mobility of adsorbed surface charges. We formulate generalised Onsager relations for a cylinder of an arbitrary radius and then derive exact expressions for the mean electro-osmotic mobility and conductivity. To employ these expressions we perform additional electrostatic calculations, with the special focus on the non-linear electrostatic effects. Our theory provides a simple explanation of a giant enhancement of the electrokinetic mobility and conductivity of hydrophobic nanotubes by highlighting the role of appropriate electrostatic and hydrodynamic length scales and their ratios. We also propose a novel interpretation of zeta potentials of cylindrical channels.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNanopores are ubiquitous to nature, and nanoporous materials found applications in various technologies. Electrokinetic transport phenomena in nanotubes include an electroosmotic flow in response to an applied electric field, a conductance, emerging due to a convective ion transfer by this flow in addition to a conventional migration of ions (electrophoresis), and also a streaming current that is generated by pressure gradient if any [1, 2]. The transport of ions (i.e. streaming and conductivity currents) in these nanoscale systems is of especial interest being important for physiological phenomena, energy harvesting, biosensing and more [3\u20137]. Besides, from the measured streaming current the zeta potential of surfaces can be inferred, which is important in colloid and interface science [8\u201310]. Finally, with the advent of nanofluidics there has been considerable interest in an unusually high conductance of electrolyte solutions in confined systems.\nExtensive efforts have gone into investigating conductivity in nanotubes and flat-parallel slits experimentally. Stein et al. [11] found a remarkably high conductivity of dilute solutions in nanoslits that is independent on the salt concentration. The corresponding to a saturation plateau conductivity augments with the surface charge density [12]. Measurements in nanotubes have shown that the conductivity plateau decreases with the radius [13]. Balme et al. [14] reported that the height of conductance plateaus is augmented in hydrophobic nanopores. The body of experimental work investigating the streaming current (including inferring the zeta potential) is much less than that for the conductivity current, although there is some literature in this area [15\u201318]. However, despite a rapid rise of an experimental activity, ion transport has been given insufficient attention compared with the transport of water. For example, we are unaware of any previous work that has addressed the impact of hydrodynamic (hydrophobic) slippage [19\u201324] on the streaming current, although the amplification of an electro-osmotic flow in slippery channels was a subject of active experimental research [25\u201328].\n\u2217 Corresponding author: oivinograd@yahoo.com\nThere is some literature describing attempts to provide a satisfactory theory of electric currents emerging in confined electrolytes. The majority of previous work considered planar geometries (where the exact solution to a non-linear electrostatic problem exists, although can only be expressed in terms of an elliptic integral) and assumed the classical noslip boundary conditions at the charged walls [29]. The conductivity plateau at low salt has been attributed to the surfaces of a constant charge density [11]. Bocquet and Charlaix [2] have briefly discussed the expected shift of the conductance plateau due to a hydrodynamic slip, assuming immobile surface charges. Applying some simple scaling arguments these authors propose that this should be \u221d b/\u2113GC, where b is the slip lenth and \u2113GC is the Gouy-Chapman length, which is inversely proportional to the surface charge density [30]. At slippery surfaces adsorbed charges could be mobile, and, therefore, responding to the external electric field as discussed by Maduar et al. [31] and supported by ab initio simulations [32]. Mouterde and Bocquet [33] derived scaling expressions describing a contribution of a hydrodynamic slip taking into account the mobility of adsorbed ions that later allowed one to interpret the computer simulation data on channel conductivity with physisorbed surface charges [34]. Their results, however, apply only for a situation of channels of a thickness that significantly exceeds the Debye length \u03bbD of the bulk electrolyte. Recently Vinogradova et al. [35] proposed an analytical theory of ion conductivity in slippery parallel-plate channels of an arbitrary thickness. These authors derived simple expressions for the mean conductivity of the channel in two regimes, of thick and thin slits, highlighting the role of hydrodynamic slip and mobility of adsorbed surface charges.\nCylinders constitute a more realistic model for artificial nanotubes and real porous materials, but remain much less theoretically understood. The main challenge is related to electrostatic calculations in the cylindrical geometry. Since the exact solution to non-linear electrostatic problem is still unknown, one needs to rely on numerical solutions or approximations. The analytical theory of an electro-osmotic flow in no-slip nanotubes developed by Rice and Whitehead [36] is restricted to small surface potentials. Later Levine et al. [37] extended this model for a no-slip cylinder to higher potentials and obtained expressions for streaming and conductivity cur-\n2 rents, but only in the integral form. During last few years some approximate analytical expressions for a conductance in cylindrical nanopores have been obtained by postulating either the overall electroneutrality (\u2018Donnan equilibrium\u2019) [38, 39], and also for the \u2018counter-ions only\u2019 case (so-called co-ion exclusion approximation) [40]. A slippery nanotube has been considered in [41]. These authors proposed an expression relating the conductivity to the integral of an electrostatic potential, assuming the surface charges are immobile. Numerical integration showed that at a given (high) surface charge the\nconductivity increases with the slip length, but a physical interpretation of this result has not been proposed. Green [42] also studied hydrophobic nanotubes with immobile surface charged and derived some useful expressions for transport coefficients. He showed that the hydrodynamic slip boundary conditions are consistent with the Onsager relations. Silkina et al. [43] performed calculations of an electro-osmotic flow in nanotubes by applying electro-hydrodynamic slip boundary conditions [31], i.e. allowing for a mobility of adsorbed charges in response to electric field. They obtained a rigorous asymptotic result for a situation of strongly overlapping diffuse layers at high surface potential and predicted a parabolic velocity (and potential) profile. This solution, however, is accurate only when \u03bbD/\u2113GC \u2264 1, i.e. when the surface charge is sufficiently small. The authors interpreted the shift (amplification) of the electro-osmotic velocity profile due to slippage and concluded that the mobility of adsorbed charges reduces the effect, but made no attempt to investigate the transport of ions.\nIn this paper we present the results of a study of ion transport in the hydrophobic nanotubes with the fixed surface charge density. The hydrophobicity implies that the electrohydrodynamic boundary condition [31] is imposed, i.e. besides hydrophobic slippage we deal with a migration of adsorbed ions in response to an applied electric field. The theory has the merit of yielding useful analytical results as well as being very well suited to numerical work. Our work provides new insight into streaming and conductivity currents in the nanotubes, as well as gives an interpretation of their zeta potential.\nOur paper is arranged as follows. In Sec. II, we define our system and present some general considerations concerning the Onsager relations and transport coefficients. Section II A describes the derivation of the Onsager relations for a hydrophobic nanotube. A detailed calculation of coefficients for the mobility matrix is presented in Sec. II B. The concept of a zeta potential of hydrophobic nanotubes is introduced. The approximate equations for zeta potentials and mean conductivity are derived in Sec. III. Numerical results for zetapotentials and conductivity are presented in Sec. IV and compared with approximate theoretical expressions. We conclude in Sec. V. In Appendix A we briefly discuss the possible reduction of ion mobilities with salt concentration to argue that this effect can safely be neglected in our system. Appendix B contains a derivation of electrostatic relationships required for calculations of streaming and conductivity currents.\nFIG. 1.

It follows from the Poisson equation that\nE\u03c1 =\u2212E \u03b5\u2207 2\u03a6\n4\u03c0 . (2)\nNote that CGS (Gaussian) electrostatic units are used throughout our paper. However, by expressing all characteristic lengths in terms of the introduced below Bjerrum and Debye lengths we will obtain the results that are independent of any specific system of units.\n3 If the bulk reservoir represents a 1:1 salt solution of con-\ncentration c\u221e, then\nE\u03c1 =\u2212E \u03b5kBT \u2207 2\u03c6 4\u03c0e =\u2212eE\u2207 2\u03c6 4\u03c0\u2113B , (3)\nwhere \u2113B = e2\n\u03b5kBT is the Bjerrum length. Note that \u2113B of water\nis equal to about 0.7 nm for room temperature. Consequently, Eq.(1) can be rewritten as\n\u03b7\u22072u = \u2202z p+ eE\n4\u03c0\u2113B \u22072\u03c6 (4)\nWe assume weak field, so that in steady state \u03c6(r) is independent on the fluid flow and satisfies the nonlinear PoissonBoltzmann equation\n\u22072\u03c6 = 1\nr\nd\ndr\n(\nr d\u03c6\ndr\n)\n= \u03bb\u22122D sinh\u03c6 (5)\nwhere \u03bbD =(8\u03c0\u2113Bn\u221e) \u22121/2 is the Debye screening length of an electrolyte solution. Note that by analysing the experimental data it is more convenient to use the concentration c\u221e[mol/L], which is related to n\u221e[m\n\u22123] as n\u221e = NA \u00d7103 \u00d7 c\u221e, where NA is Avogadro\u2019s number. We also recall that a useful formula for 1:1 electrolyte is [44]\n\u03bbD[nm] = 0.305[nm]\u221a c\u221e[mol/L] , (6)\nso that upon increasing c\u221e from 10 \u22127 (in pure water, where the ionic strength is due to the dissociating H+ and OH\u2212 ions) to 10\u22121 mol/L the screening length is reduced from about 1 \u00b5m down to ca. 1 nm.\nTo integrate Eq.(5) we impose two electrostatic boundary conditions. The first condition always reflects the symmetry of the channel \u03c6 \u2032|r=0 = 0, where \u2032 denotes d/dr. The second condition is applied at the walls and can be either that of a constant surface potential (conductors) or of a constant surface charge density (insulators). Here we limit ourselves by the constant charge condition, which can be formulated as\n\u03c6 \u2032|r=R = 2\n\u2113GC , (7)\nwhere \u2113GC = e\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u2113B is the Gouy-Chapman length. For high\nsurface charges, say \u03c3 \u2243 36 mC/m2, the Gouy-Chapman length is small, \u2113GC \u2243 1 nm. However, \u03c3 \u2243 0.73 mC/m2 gives \u2113GC \u2243 50 nm.\nThe linearity of Eq.(4) implies that its solution represents the decoupled and superimposed contribution of the pressuredriven and electro-osmotic flows\nu =\u2212mh\u2202z p+meE, (8)\nwhere mh and me are the functions of r that depend on electrostatic and electro-hydrodynamic boundary conditions at the solid wall. Below we refer these functions to as hydrodynamic\nand electro-osmotic mobilities. Note that the first term in (8) is taken with minus to provide positive mh when \u2202z p < 0. As we will see below, a sign of me depends on the sign of the surface charge (potential).\nIt is convenient to use the average values of variables, U = u, Mh =mh, and Me =me. For any variable f its average value across the cross-section of the cylindrical nanotube is given by\nf = 2\nR2\nR \u222b\n0\nr f dr. (9)\nFormally the above considerations are equivalent to the statement that in the linear response regime, the transport of water and ions through the nanotube can be then expressed in terms of mobility matrix M :\n(\nU J\n)\n=\n(\nMh Me Me K\n)(\n\u2212\u2202z p E\n)\n= M\n(\n\u2212\u2202z p E\n)\n(10)\nwhere J [A/m2] is the mean current density\nJ = j+ J\u03c3 , (11)\nand K [S/m] is the mean conductivity of the channel. The first term in (11) is associated with the transport of the diffuse cations and anions inside the nanotube that generates the local density of current j = j+ + j\u2212. The second term reflects the contribution of the surface current j\u03c3 emerging due to adsorbed mobile ions that are located at the ring of perimeter 2\u03c0R. Therefore, this surface averaged contribution to the mean current density is given by J\u03c3 = 2 j\u03c3/R.\nAs a side note, in experiment one usually measure the con-\nductance G [S]. For a nanotube of length L\nG = K \u03c0R2\nL (12)\nA 2\u00d7 2 mobility matrix M is expected to be positive definite and symmetric (with equal off-diagonal coefficients), as assumed in (10), by analogy with Onsager\u2019s relations in (bulk) non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The consequence of the symmetry is so-called electrohydrodynamic coupling\nJ\n\u2212\u2202z p |E=0 =\nU E |\u2212\u2202z p=0. (13)\nThe mobility matrix M fully characterizes electrokinetic phenomena in the nanotubes and, once its elements are known, Eq.(10) can be used to find, without tedious calculations, the liquid flows and currents that are generated by any combination of two applied forces.\nHowever, it is by no means not obvious that by imposing appropriate for hydrophobic surfaces electro-hydrodynamic boundary conditions, Eq.(10) will necessarily hold. More precisely, the equality of off-diagonal elements Me is still an assumption that should be proven for a situation when the fluid velocity at r = R satisfies [31]\nu|r=R = b ( \u2212\u2202ru|r=R + (1\u2212 \u00b5)eE 2\u03c0\u03b7\u2113B\u2113GC )\n(14)\n4 The parameter \u00b5 is the fraction of immobile surface charges that can vary from 0 for fully mobile charges to 1 in the case when all adsorbed ions are fixed. The hydrodynamic slip length b in (14) can be of the order of several tens of nanometers [21\u201324], but not much more. In our calculations we use b = 10 nm. However, our discussion will also include a larger value of b = 100 nm reported in experiment [24].\nTo prove the consistency of Eq.(14) with the Onsager relations we have to calculate the coefficients of the mobility matrix. In doing so it is convenient to set one of two possible driving forces to zero."

The calculations are made for several hydrophobic nanotubes of the same radius R = 10 nm, surface charge and slip length, but different \u00b5 , computed for two concentrations of salt, c\u221e = 10 \u22125 mol/L and c\u221e = 10\u22121 mol/L which corresponds to \u03bbD \u2243 100 nm and 1 nm, i.e. to the regimes of thin and thick cylinder. The fixed \u2113GC = 5 nm corresponds to a surface charge density \u03c3 \u2243 7.3 mC/m2. The response is always linear, and the slope of the straight lines is invoked to find the electro-osmotic mobility Me that depends on c\u221e. The computed data show that for nanotubes of the same \u00b5 a larger J is observed at lower concentration, but a four orders of magnitude increase in c\u221e reduce the streaming current only slightly. However, on reducing \u00b5 from 0.75 down to 0.25 the streaming current is significantly suppressed. Once Me is known, we can determine the value of \u03b6 . Calculations from Eq. (24) show that the numerical results (from top to bottom) in Fig. 2 correspond to \u03b6 \u2243 4.7,4.2 and 2.2. Also included in Fig. 2 are the streaming currents calculated analytically using \u03b6 given by (25) with \u03b60 obtained for the thin and thick cylinder limits (Eqs.(43) and (45)). We see that with these parameters Eq. (43) provides an excellent fit to numerical results, but Eq. (45) slightly overestimates the results. It must be remembered that this is a first-order calculation only, and given the simplifications made we do not expect it to be very accurate.\nWe now turn to zeta potential of nanotubes. The main issue we address is how to enhance \u03b6 by generating a slip velocity at the surface and by tuning the salt concentration. Figure 3 includes \u03b6 computed as a function of c\u221e. Note that varying c\u221e from 10\u22126 to 10\u22121 mol/L is equivalent to the range of R/\u03bbD from 0.032 to 10.3. In this calculations we keep \u2113GC = 5 nm fixed, so that \u03c6s varies with salt, but the ratio b/\u2113GC = 2 remains constant, i.e. independent on c\u221e. The computed \u03c6s is\nalso included in Fig. 3. It can be seen that on increasing c\u221e it reduces, but never becomes small. The calculations of \u03b6 are made using \u00b5 = 0.5 and 0. As discussed above, in the latter case of fully mobile surface charges \u03b6 = \u03b60, although the hydrodynamic slip length is finite. For the thin nanotubes \u03b6 does not depend on salt and takes its maximal (constant) value. When nanotubes become thick, \u03b6 begins to decrease with c\u221e. It can be seen that when \u00b5 = 0 the surface potential is always larger than \u03b6 = \u03b60, but at \u00b5 = 0.5 the zeta potential is significantly amplified by hydrodynamic slippage and in the sufficiently concentrated solutions \u03b6 dramatically exceeds \u03c6s. The numerical data are compared with the analytical calculations in which \u03b60 is evaluated using Eqs.(43) (thick nanotubes, c\u221e \u2243 10\u22121 mol/L) or (45) (thin nanotubes, c\u221e \u2264 10\u22122 mol/L). The fits are quite good, but there is some discrepancy. The analytical equations overestimate the exact numerical results, which is the consequence of an assumption \u03c6 \u2243 0 (see Sec. III A). Similar fits for thick nanotubes made using a next order approximation, Eq.(B8), would make an improvement to the fit, but slightly underestimate the numerical results.\nThe amplification of the zeta potential relative to \u03b60 is illustrated in Fig. 4, where the data are reproduced from Fig. 3. With these parameters \u03b6 of the hydrophobic channel is amplified in ca. 3.5 times in dilute solutions, where \u03bbD \u2265 R. In more concentrated solutions (of small \u03bbD) \u03b6/\u03b60 begins to rapidly augment with c\u221e to larger values. It is instructive to compare these results with a calculation of \u03b6/\u03c6s, also included in Fig. 4. This ratio increases with c\u221e strictly monotonically and is always lower than \u03b6/\u03b60. When c\u221e \u2264 10\u22123 mol/L, \u03b6/\u03c6s is smaller than unity, but then \u03b6 exceeds \u03c6s. This is especially well seen in Fig. 3. Also included in Fig. 4 are the theoretical results for \u03b6/\u03b60 obtained from Eqs.(47) and (48). The theoretical predictions provide a good qualitative agreement with the numerical data, but show smaller amplification of the zeta potential. An obvious explanation for this discrepancy is the neglected average potential of the nanotube. Indeed, Eq.(B8) that takes into account a non-zero \u03c6 for the high concentration branch in Fig. 4 provides a better match to the numerical data.\n8 10\u22126 10\u22125 10\u22124 10\u22123 10\u22122 10\u22121\nc\u221e, mol/L\n0\n2\n4 6 \u03b6 /\u03b6 0 , \u03b6 /\u03c6 s\nFIG. 4. \u03b6/\u03b60 (solid curve) and \u03b6/\u03c6s (dashed curve) computed as a function of c\u221e for cylindrical channels of R = 10 nm, \u2113GC = 5 nm, b = 10 nm, and \u00b5 = 0.5.

We have marked with triangles the points of \u2113Du/R = 1 and one can see that this branch for both curves occurs in the vicinity of these points. The upper curve that corresponds to a highly charged cylinder is well fitted using K0 given by Eq.(49) indicating that the nanotube effectively behaves as thick even when \u03bbD/R is large. The curve for the weakly charged nanotube is well described using K0 calculated from Eq.(50) when c\u221e is below 10 \u22124 mol/L. The use of (51) makes practically no difference to the fit, as expected. At concentrations c\u221e \u2265 10\u22123 mol/L the weakly charged nanotube is effectively thick and the numerical data are well fitted if K0 given by (49) is employed.\nThe mean conductivity of the nanotubes can be amplified by the slippage effect. This is illustrated in Fig. 7, where the amplification of the mean conductivity is calculated using \u00b5 = 0.5 (a half of surface charges is mobile) and a moderate slip length b = 10 nm. For these examples we use \u2113GC = 1 and 50 nm, the same as in Fig. 6. It can be seen, that for low concentrations (\u2113Du/R \u2265 1) the conductivity amplifica-\n9 10\u22126 10\u22125 10\u22124 10\u22123 10\u22122 10\u22121\nc\u221e, mol/L\n1\n2 3 K /K 0\nFIG. 7. The conductivity amplification K/K0 as a function of c\u221e obtained for the same nanotubes as in Fig. 6, but with b = 10 nm, and \u00b5 = 0.5. Filled symbols are obtained using K0 from Fig. 6 and K calculated from (40). Open squares show calculations from Eq.(52). The big triangles mark the points of \u2113Du/R = 1.\ntion due to slip, K/K0, is independent on salt and takes its largest value. For a highly charged nanotube (\u2113GC = 1 nm) the slippage increase the conductivity by a factor of ca. 3, but for a weakly charged cylinder the enhancement is low with these papameters. When \u2113Du/R becomes smaller than unity, the value of K/K0 decreases with salt. It is well seen that for a curve calculated using \u2113GC = 50 nm K \u2243 K0 when c\u221e \u2265 10\u22122 mol/L. In other words, there is no conductivity amplification due to slippage. However, a highly charged nanotube (\u2113GC = 1 nm) shows the enhancement of the mean conductivity in ca. 2 times even when c\u221e = 10 \u22121 mol/L. The results of theoretical calculations are also shown in Fig. 7. The theoretical data for K0 of Fig. 6 are reproduced and summed up with \u2206K given by (42) to obtain K. Calculated values of K/K0 fit very well the numerical curves. We have also verified Eq.(52). As predicted, it represents a sensible approximation for K/K0 if \u2113Du/R \u2265 1 and \u03bbD/\u2113GC \u2264 1. Indeed, the plateau branch of the numerical curve obtained using \u2113GC = 50 nm is well fitted by Eq.(52)."

            "text": "We have presented a theory describing the transport of ions in hydrophobic nanotubes with the constant surface charge density. The electro-hydrodynamicboundary condition [31] is imposed at the hydrophobic wall, which assumes that the surface demonstates a hydrodynamic slippage and some portion of the adsorbed surface charges can migrate relative to fluid by reacting to the applied electric field (but not to the hydrodynamic tangential stress). Numerical solutions are presented and fully validate our analysis. These results are directly relevant for enhanced streaming and conductivity currents in carbon and boron nitride nanotubes, which are currently the area of very active research, as well as for conventional nanoporous membranes.\nThe main results of our work can be summarized as follows. We have proven that when the electro-hydrodynamic boundary condition is applied the Onsager relations hold pro-\nvided the adsorbed surface ions are transferred in a pressuredriven flow with the slip velocity of liquid. Namely, we have derived general expressions for elements of the 2\u00d72 mobility matrix, Eq.(10), and demonstrated that the off-diagonal coefficients are equal if the electro-hydrodynamic boundary condition, Eq.(14), is imposed and provided Eq.(21) is valid. These expressions include some mean electrostatic functions, which we have calculated analytically for two specific regimes (of thin and thick nanotubes). Importantly, these regimes are defined not by just \u03bbD/R, but also controlled by the value of \u03bbD/\u2113GC, i.e. effective charge of the walls. We have then derived simple analytical approximations for the electro-osmotic mobility and mean conductivity in these two regimes. Our results show that qualitative features of the electrosmotic mobility and conductivity curves for cylinders are the same as for slits, but there is some important quantitative difference due to different expressions for electrostatic functions. We have also given a novel interpretation of the zeta potential of nanotubes.\nOur results open strategies to tune the ion transport in nanotubes via a modification of their walls and, vice versa, to probe surface properties by measuring the streaming or conductivity currents. Our quantitative results can be improved by performing more accurate calculations of the central (axis) potential. This remains a challenging mathematical problem and a subject of future research. Other fruitful directions would be to extend the results for so-called charge regulation surfaces and for systems, where both pressure drop and electric field are applied simultaneously. The latter calculations are now straightforward and can be done by using the proven Onsager relations."

The deviations from this ideal mobilty in dilute solutions do not depend on the ion radius and scale with c 1/2 \u221e . Thus, Eq.(A2) is functionally equivalent to the Kohlrausch empirical model [46].\nIt follows from (A2) that at c\u221e = 10 \u22122 mol/L the decrease in the mobilities of ions of R = 0.3 nm compared to those at an infinite dilution is less than 10%. Concequently for solutions of c\u221e \u2264 10\u22122 mol/L (where R/\u03bbD is small), this effect can safely be neglected. At larger concentrations the analysis based on an upper limit of ion mobilities becomes quite approximate. Nevertheless, it provides us with some guidance. As a side note, at our largest concentration c\u221e = 10 \u22121 mol/L the use of Eq.(A1) would also represent too rough an approximation since R/\u03bbD \u2243 0.3."

It can be seen that Eq.(B4) remains very accurate for a thick channel and even when \u03bbD/R = O(1) provided \u03bbD/\u2113GC is large. Substituting (B4) into (B2) one obtains cosh\u03c6 = 1, which is equivalent to \u03c6 = 0 and (\u03c6 \u2032)2 = 0. However, this result holds only if R \u2192 \u221e.

A calculation of the average potential and its effect on the zeta potential in the case of a highly charged thick nanotube remains very difficult and well beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, we see that at large \u03bbD/\u2113GC the surface potential (see Fig. 9) is much higher than \u03c6 , so that the later can be neglected in the first-order calculations. Clearly, given this simplification we do not expect the calculations of the zeta potential to be very accurate.\nIt is naturally to assume that corrections to cosh\u03c6 and (\u03c6 \u2032)2 are proportional to the ratio of the EDL length to the channel area.
