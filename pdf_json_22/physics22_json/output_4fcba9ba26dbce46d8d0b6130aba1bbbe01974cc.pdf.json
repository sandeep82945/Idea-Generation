It sheds ight on the properties of the binaries for which the more massive rimary component completed its main-sequence (MS) phase and on he dramatic processes accompanying the transition into a compact bject (e.g. Heger et al. 2003 ; Cerda-Duran & Elias-Rosa 2018 ). strometry is an important tool to study this population, as it is\nensitive to binaries with orbital periods of the order of a few ears, depending on the binary distance, which corresponds to orbital eparations to which other techniques, spectroscopy or photometry, re less sensitive (e.g. Jorissen & Frankowski 2008 ). Furthermore, nlike spectroscopic binaries for which the orbital inclination is ot known, the compact-object mass in astrometric binaries can be etermined, and the three types of compact objects can, in principle, e distinguished (e.g. Halbwachs et al. 2022 ). The Gaia astrometric space mission (Gaia Collaboration 2016 ) rovides a promising detection channel, as it is expected to detect an nprecedentedly large number of astrometric binaries. For example, heoretical studies predict that the Gaia mission carries the potential\nE-mail: sahar.shahaf@weizmann.ac.il\na c\n2022 The Author(s) ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\nf disco v ering hundreds of binaries with non-interacting BHs in rbital periods 5 yr (e.g. Breivik, Chatterjee & Larson 2017 ; ashian & Loeb 2017 ; Yamaguchi et al. 2018 ; Chawla et al. 2022 ; anssens et al. 2022 ). NSs and WDs should be even more frequent e.g. Fryer et al. 2012 ). Note, ho we ver, that the stringent selection riteria imposed on the DR3 sample of astrometric binaries (see albwachs et al. 2022 ), designed to reduce the contamination of the strometric catalogue by spurious signals, probably excluded many f these systems, impairing the detection of the compact objects. In preparation for the release of the astrometric orbits of Gaia , hahaf et al. ( 2019 ) proposed a triage technique to identify astrometic binaries that have compact companions based on their derived emimajor axis, parallax, orbital period, and the estimated primary ass. The technique requires the knowledge of the proper mass\u2013 uminosity relation (MLR) to rule out a single or a close-binary MS ompanion. Indeed, the DR3 binary release (Gaia Collaboration, renou et al. 2022 , hereafter NSS \u2013 Non-Single Stars) used a chematic version of this approach, with the MLR of Pecaut & amajek ( 2013 ), to identify 735 astrometric binaries with compact ompanions (see also Andre ws, Brei vik & Chatterjee 2019 ; Andrew t al. 2022 , for a different approach).\nIn this communication, we return to the triage of the DR3 strometric binaries with a more careful analysis that uses a more onserv ati ve MLR to identify compact-secondary binaries based on\nM\nFigure 1.

No binary can exist below the dotted line. All triple systems have to reside between dashed and dotted lines. Binaries abo v e the dashed lines must be compact objects.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 , we briefly describe ur astrometric triage scheme and discuss the effect of stellar age and omposition on this technique. In Section 3 , we present the triage of aia DR3 binaries, provide a list of class-membership probabilities, nd compile a sample of systems that are very likely to host a compact bject in Section 4 . In Section 5 , we show some of the emerging roperties of our compact-object sample. Finally, in Section 6 , we riefly discuss the sample and preliminary findings and propose some deas for future work. ASTROM ETR IC T R I AG E n this section, we re-discuss the astrometric triage introduced by hahaf et al. ( 2019 ), with a focus on using the appropriate MLR for S stars. Consider an astrometric binary with an angular semimajor axis 0 . For an unresolved binary, \u03b10 reflects the motion of the centre f light around the binary centre of mass. In cases where the more uminous primary star is significantly brighter than its secondary ompanion, the photocentre of the system is located near the primary tar\u2019s position. This could happen, for example, if the secondary is a aint substellar companion or a compact object. On the other hand, f both components are luminous, the photocentre is located near the entre of mass of the binary, up to a point where no astrometric orbit an be detected.\nShahaf et al. ( 2019 ) presented the astrometric mass ratio function AMRF),\n\u2261 \u03b10\n( M 1\nM\n)\u22121 / 3 ( P\nyr\n)\u22122 / 3 , (1)\nhere P and are the orbital period and parallax, and M 1 is the ass of the primary, more luminous, star. A can be determined for\nvery astrometric binary for which M 1 is known.\nNRAS 518, 2991\u20133003 (2023)\nMESA Isochrones & Stellar Tracks. See w aps.cf a.harvard.edu/MIST/.\nM p c\nThe unknown mass ratio q = M 2 / M 1 is linked to AMRF via\n= q (1 + q) 2 / 3\n( 1 \u2212 S(1 + q) q(1 + S) ) , (2)\nhere S = F 2 /F 1 is the luminosity ratio between the two comonents. The term inside the parenthesis in equation ( 2 ) accounts or the fact that we follow the orbit of the photocentre, rather than hat of the primary star (see e.g. van de Kamp 1975 ); assuming he mass-luminosity relation is superlinear, S q and this term is on-ne gativ e. Shahaf et al. ( 2019 ) showed that whenever the luminosity ratio f the two possible MS stars can be expressed as a function of he mass ratio, S( q); one is able to place some constraints on the ature and properties of the faint companion in the binary system. lower estimate for the mass ratio is obtained by assuming that the econdary companion is non-luminous, namely, plugging S = 0 into quation ( 2 ). Under this assumption, the AMRF is a function of the ass ratio alone. The minimal mass ratio, q min , is a root of the polynomial A \u22123 q 3 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 q \u2212 1. Since A is a positive number, the minimal mass ratio is nique and can be obtained analytically (e.g. Heacox 1995 ; Shahaf, azeh & Faigler 2017 ; Andrew et al. 2022 ). The corresponding inimal secondary mass, i.e. the mass of the companion assuming hat it does not emit light, is given by\n2 , min = q min \u00b7 M 1 . (3) his lower limit on the mass may, in many cases, constrain the ompact object\u2019s nature. Ho we ver, this can only be done if we rule ut the possibility of a single MS secondary or a companion who is y itself a close MS binary.\n.1 AMRF classification\no illustrate the triage approach, we plot in Fig. 1 two theoretical MRF curves as a function of the mass ratio q , for 0.4 and 1.0 M S primary stars. The dotted (lower) curves in the two panels resent binaries with a single MS secondary; the dashed (upper) urves triple systems, with a close equal-mass MS binary as the\na l t\nc a c o m w w N t l a u\nt v d c h m\ne s b c i\nl a\nFigure 3.

Note that the range of the oldpopulation curve ends at \u223c 0 . 9 M , for which the corresponding primaries are expected to leave the main sequence.\nc o s\nb t h\nf o t N\nc r a W a b\n2\nT d T a a c n s h s\nd [\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2991/6825524 by IN IST-C N R S IN SU user on 08 April 2023\nstrometric secondary; and the solid curves binaries with a nonuminous companion. The dotted and dashed lines were derived with he Gaia G -band MLR of Pecaut & Mamajek ( 2013 ). Binaries with MS companions have to reside on the lower dotted urves, with a position that depends on the mass ratio of the strometric binary. Triple systems with close-binary MS companions ould be located anywhere below the upper dashed line, depending n the mass ratio of the close binary. Only triple systems with equalass close-binary companions have to be on the upper dashed line, ith a position that depends on the wide-binary mass ratio. Binaries ith compact companions have to reside on the continuous curve. ote that the positions of realistic systems do not necessarily fall on he expected position. This is because the shape of the distinguishing ines is affected by the accuracy of the assumed MLR, and because binary position on the diagram is affected by the measurements ncertainties. The AMRF theoretical curves have maximal values \u2013 A MS for\nhe single MS secondary and A TR for the triple-system curve. These alues, which depend on the primary mass, are noted in the figure by ots and squares. Any wide binary with A > A TR probably has a ompact companion. If the companion is a single object, the system as to reside on the continuous curve. In such a case, the companion ass can be derived from the value of A . In the general case, though, one cannot determine the value of q , ven if the primary mass is known, because the luminosity of the econdary is unknown. Therefore, to identify unresolved astrometric inaries that are likely to host a compact object as their faint ompanion, Shahaf et al. ( 2019 ) divided the astrometric binaries nto three classes, based on their measured AMRF value, A :\n(i) Class-I binaries ( A < A MS ), where the companion is most ikely a single MS star. The class-I parameter space is shown as crisscrossed area in Fig. 2 .\n(ii) Class-II binaries ( A MS < A < A TR ), where the companion annot be a single MS star, but can be either an MS close binary r a compact object. The class-II parameter space is denoted with lanted lines.\n(iii) Class-III binaries ( A > A TR ), where the companion cannot e a single MS star nor a close MS binary; these systems are likely o host a compact object secondary. The class-III parameter space is ighlighted by small circles.\nFig. 1 demonstrates that the limiting values A MS and A TR vary as a unction of M 1 . Fig. 2 shows the limiting AMRF values as a function f the primary mass. We added in Fig. 2 purple and light-blue stripes hat illustrate the expected A values of WDs, at 0 . 45 \u22120 . 75 M , and Ss, at 1 . 4 \u22122 . 1 M . Note that the locations of binaries with primaries 2 M and NS ompanions are all in the class-III region, making their identification elatively simple. The WD stripe, on the other hand, is only partially bo v e the A TR curve. This implies that only binaries with massive Ds can be identified as such, while binaries with low-mass WDs nd relati vely massi ve primaries will escape detection. We will come ack to this point in an accompanying paper.\n.2 Re-consideration of class-II and class-III limits\nhe AMRF limits depend on the assumed MLR, which in turn epends on the age and chemical composition of the specific binary. he observed MLR of Pecaut & Mamajek ( 2013 ) used in Figs 1 nd 2 is an av eraged relation, taken o v er the distribution of ages nd compositions in the Solar neighbourhood. While this relation an properly describe the population of stars in the field, this is not ecessarily the case when considering two stars in a particular binary ystem. Assuming the two stars were formed at the same time and ave the same composition, their relative flux contribution follows ome specific isochrone track rather than the local averaged MLR.\nTo demonstrate this point, Fig. 3 presents two A TR curves for two ifferent populations: a young population, with age of 126 Myr and Fe/H] = 0.5 (a dashed-blue curve), an old population of 12.6 Gyr\nMNRAS 518, 2991\u20133003 (2023)\nM\na c p T c b\nl T b o c t o f\n2\nI o l e c\n( m ( o a t I a w\n7 b g c f m\ni s o M m r a t m\nt t s p c M d\n2\nE w d t p o\n3\nW p c\nt\nd p m c m t\nc s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2991/6825524 by IN IST-C N R S IN SU user on 08 April 2023\nnd [Fe/H] = \u22122.5 (dashed-red curve). To derive the first two urves, we simulated a synthetic stellar population using ARTPOP ackage 2 (Greco & Danieli 2021 ) and the MIST isochrone grids. he figure also displays the (upper) curve of Fig. 1 (dashed-gray urve), based on Pecaut & Mamajek ( 2013 ) MLR, which was used y NSS. Fig. 3 shows that the limit used by NSS often underestimates the imiting AMRF values separating between class-II and -III binaries. herefore, we have adopted a more conserv ati ve classification curve ased on the upper envelope of an ensemble of models generated v er various stellar ages and metallicities. As opposed to the NSS lassification curve, our curve provides reliable A MS and A TR curves hat can be used regardless of the underlying age and metallicity f the binary. We elaborate on the deri v ation of the curves in the ollowing subsection.\n.3 Adopted classification limits\nn Section 2.2 , we show that the shape of A MS and A TR depends n the age and composition of the stars in the binary system. In ight of this claim, a plausible course of action would be to classify ach binary while considering its particular age, iron abundance, and orresponding uncertainty estimates.\nHo we ver, the FLAME stellar ages tend to have large uncertainties Creev e y et al. 2022 ; Babusiaux et al. 2022 ) and the GSP-phot etallicities are probably biased and require further calibration Andrae et al. 2022 ). Furthermore, these values are provided by Gaia nly to about half of the sample of astrometric binaries. As a result, nd after attempting to incorporate these values, we concluded that he use of individual age and metallicity estimates is not efficient. nstead, we opted to derive a \u2018global\u2019 limiting curve that can provide conserv ati ve estimate for the v alues for the classification, e ven hen the age and composition are not well constrained. To do so, we generated a set of A MS and A TR curves, spanning from\nto 10.2 in log (Age yr \u22121 ) and \u22123 to 0.5 in [Fe/H]. The spacing in oth grids is 0.05 dex. Based on this set of limiting values, we enerated a new limiting curve that follows the outer envelope of all urves in our grid. To do so, we used the 99.9 percentile of all curves or a given mass value and smoothed the resulting envelope with a o ving av erage with a width of \u223c0 . 1 M . Theoretical models are known to estimate the radii of M-dwarfs naccurately (e.g. Morrell & Naylor 2019 ). Therefore, for primary tars less massive than 0 . 5 M , instead of using the upper envelope f the theoretical models, we used the one based on the Pecaut & amajek ( 2013 ) MLR. We added a positive constant to this lowass limiting curve to ensure that the final curve is continuous. The esulting limiting curve is plotted, as solid black lines, along with ll the models used in our ensemble, in Fig. 4 . A look-up table with he values of the limiting curves is provided in the supplementary\naterial. Fig. 4 demonstrates how the limiting curves computed based on he Pecaut & Mamajek ( 2013 ) MLR follow the general trend of hose generated using MIST isochrones. The figure also shows that ome MIST-based curves significantly deviate from this trend. For rimary stars more massive than \u223c1 M , these deviations are mostly aused by mildly evolved stars, that are on the verge of leaving the S. On the other hand, for primaries less massive than \u223c0 . 5 M the eviations mostly represent young stars of high metallicity.\nNRAS 518, 2991\u20133003 (2023)\nSee the online documentation at artpop.readthedocs.io\nquipped with a more conserv ati ve threshold for class-III binaries, e now turn to re-consider the Gaia astrometric binaries. First, we erive a slightly smaller sample of astrometric binaries by vetting the argets based on the reported orbital parameters. Then, we obtain the robability of each binary being in class-II or class-III, given their rbital parameters and uncertainties.\n.1 Sample selection\ne first queried the Gaia database for astrometric binaries with MS rimary stars that have mass estimate, according to the following onditions:\n(i) nss solution type is Orbital or AstroSpecroSB1 ; (ii) bit index is 8191 or 65535; (iii) binary masses catalogue m1 ref is IsocLum ; and (iv) binary masses catalogue combination method is (v) Orbital + M1 or AstroSpectroSB1 + M1 . The first two conditions require that the astrometric orbit was erived from the primary processing pipeline and has all orbital arameters fitted. The following two conditions require that a primary ass estimate exists for the system and that its primary star was lassified by as an MS star. For details regarding the deri v ation of the asses, see section 5.1 of NSS. This procedure left a total of 127 026 argets in the sample. We then applied the Halbwachs et al.

We required, somewhat rbitrarily, that the quadratic mean of the relative uncertainty in A , B , , and G Thiele\u2013Innes coefficients will be smaller than 3, namely 2 TI \u2261 ( A A )2 + ( B B )2 + ( F F )2 + ( G G )2 36 . (4) his step w as tak en to ensure that our classification probability stimates (see below) properly converge and left 110 401 orbits n the cleaned sample. Finally, we opted to exclude targets with orbital periods longer han the time span of the data analysed by Gaia DR3. We, therefore, emo v ed systems with orbital periods longer than 1000 d. We were ventually left with 101 380 systems in our cleaned sample. This ample includes 16 609 AstroSpectroSB1 orbital and 84771 rbital solutions. Our additional selection criteria, therefore, lightly fa v our AstroSpectroSB1 solutions o v er Orbital ones.\n.2 Distribution of the deri v ed AMRF\nig. 5 presents a density plot of the cleaned sample on the AMRF\u2013 rimary-mass plane. The figure displays a prominent vertical concentration at about 1 M , probably due to the o v erab undance of solar -type stars in he Gaia sample. The vertical stripe has a clear maximum density at \u223c 0 . 4, which seems to leak o v er neighbouring masses, at a range f A between 0.3 and 0.4. The position and shape of this feature are n line with the expected values of A MS , shown in the bottom panel f Fig. 4 . The occurrence of systems at this region of parameters is\nrobably enhanced by an observational bias: for an MS binary, the MRF attains its maximal value, A MS together with the maximal ize of the photo-centric orbit. As a result, Gaia probably fa v ours the etection of these systems. An additional feature of Fig. 5 is a well-separated cluster of elatively high AMRF values, centred at A \u223c 0 . 55 for primary asses of \u223c1 M . The position of this cluster is consistent with he expected range of values of A TR , shown in the top panel of Fig. 4 . plausible claim is that this cluster is comprised of triple systems ith close equal-mass MS binaries as the astrometric secondaries. The diagram also shows an excess of systems with high AMRF alues, between 0.45 and 0 . 75 M , located within the purple stripe, robably consisting of WD companions, and a few binaries that ight have NS companions (see below).\n.3 Classification probability\ne mo v e no w to di viding the cleaned sample into the three classes of ection 2 . Because of the uncertainties of the theoretical boundaries nd the uncertainties of the primary mass and A , our classification s of probabilistic nature. We derive three probabilities:\nPr I = Pr ( A < A MS ) , Pr II \u2261 Pr ( A MS < A < A TR ) , and r III \u2261 Pr ( A TR < A ) , (5) sing Monte\u2013Carlo experiments. To consider the uncertainties of he orbital elements, we randomly drew N = 10 5 random instances f the Thiele\u2013Innes parameters, parallax, period, eccentricity, and rimary mass. The sampling was performed while considering the ncertainties and covariance between the parameters, as reported in he Gaia catalogue.\nAs proposed by Shahaf et al. ( 2019 ), the values of the AMRF nd primary mass determine the classification of the binary. We alculated A , A MS , and A TR for each draw, and estimated the classII probability by\n\u02c6 r III = r + 1 N + 1 , (6)\nhere r is the number of instances for which A is larger than A TR (see, or example, Davison & Hinkley 1997 ). The class-II membership robability, \u02c6 Pr II , was estimated similarly. For brevity, we do not use he \u2018hat\u2019 superscript in the following. We emphasize that whenever\nembership probability is discussed, we refer to our bootstrap-based stimate, derived according to equation ( 6 ), as described above.\nA list of the Pr II and Pr III classification probabilities for all targets n our sample is provided in Table 1 . The class-I membership probaility, Pr I, can be derived using the two other class probabilities, the umber of Monte-Carlo samples, N , and equation ( 6 ). Histograms of he classification probabilities are plotted in Fig. 6 .\nFig. 7 displays the distribution of Pr III in the AMRF\u2013primaryass plane. Each bin in the diagram is colour coded according to its ean Pr III value. A concentration of high-Pr III systems is located\nbo v e the A TR curv e, and appears in black. A stripe of systems with igh to intermediate class-III probability follows the expected WD nvelope. The analysis of this sub-sample of possible binaries with D companions is deferred to a follow-up study. Fig. 7 also suggests that for primary stars less massive than 0 . 5 M , the limiting values calculated according to the MIST odels tend to underestimate the transition between class-I and - I systems. This is in accord with a reported discrepancy between the mpirically estimated and the theoretically expected M-dwarf radii\nMNRAS 518, 2991\u20133003 (2023)\nM\n( l w\n4\nW p\nFigure 7.

As described abo v e, we rectified our imiting curves for primaries less massive than 0 . 5 M , so that they ere not severely affected by this discrepancy (also see Fig. 3 ).\nH I G H L Y -PR O B ABLE CLASS-I I I SYSTEMS\ne now define a sample of systems likely to host compact comanions, applying the Benjamini & Hochberg ( 1995 ) false-disco v ery\nNRAS 518, 2991\u20133003 (2023)\nate (FDR) approach, designed to control the expected proportion of alse disco v eries. In this work conte xt, false disco v eries are systems hat are wrongfully identified as class-III binaries.\nWe set \u03b1, the upper limit on the e xpectanc y values of the false isco v ery rate, to\n= 10 per cent , (7) hich yields 177 systems in this sub-sample, which we refer to as he class-III sample henceforth. Accordingly, only 18 ( \u223c\u03b1 \u00d7 177) r fewer binaries are expected to be wrongly identified as class-III ystems.\nA discussion of what constitutes a false disco v ery in the context f this work is given in Section 6 . The selection criterion we sed is equi v alent to setting a minimal class-III probability of 9 . 984 per cent , i.e. only 16 out of the 10 5 Monte-Carlo instances ell below the A TR limit. A list of the selected class-III binaries is iven in Table 2 . Most of these systems, if their orbits are valid, contain compact econdaries. Therefore, we can derive their masses and possibly istinguish between the WD, NS, or BH companions. Ho we ver, e stress the possibility that erroneous orbital fits might conaminate the sample, particularly when considering a sample of are candidates. We therefore advocate that the validity of these rbits should be assessed externally (see the caveats discussion in ection 6 ). The proportion of AstroSpectroSB1 orbits in the class-III ample is lower than that of the entire sample; out of the 177 ystems, only seven binaries have a joint astrometric and spectrocopic orbital solution. This is probably because the median Gand magnitude of the class-III systems is \u223c15.6, \u223c2 magnitudes ainter than the median of the entire clean-astrometric sample. As e know, the Gaia RVS measurements are limited to bright stars, ith a limit at \u223c14 mag. The difference in apparent magnitude etween the clean sample and the class-III sample is associated ith the mass bias of the triage scheme. As detailed in Sections 2 nd 6 , the triage is more sensitive to low-mass stars with WD ompanions.\nTable 2. A table of the highly probable class-III systems.

The difference emanates from (i) vetting the quality of the orbital solution, (ii) conserv ati vely estimating the limiting A TR curve, and (iii) setting a high-purity threshold on Pr III. As a result of the different vetting, only 581 systems of the NSS ample are included in our cleaned sample (see Section 3.1 ). While ll these systems have Pr I 0, only 148 were classified here as ighly probable class-III systems. We attribute the difference to our onserv ati ve approach in setting the limiting classification value, TR . There are 29 systems in our class-III sample that do not appear in he NSS class-III sample. These systems were not included by NSS ecause their significance value is smaller than 20, the limit hey adopted for considering valid orbits. As explained above, we sed a different limit, which we believe is more appropriate for our urpose, and allowed us to include them in the analysis. .2 Comparison with the Andrews et al. ( 2022 ) candidates nother catalogue of 24 NS and BH candidates in Gaia DR3 was ecently published by Andrews, Taggart & F ole y ( 2022 ), based on heir derived mass function (see equation 10 ); out of this sample, 4 of are also included in our class-III sample. The remaining 10 ystems were rejected in our early stage of initial sample selection see Section 3.1 ) \u2013 six have orbital periods longer than 1000 d, three o not have a primary mass estimate in the binary masses table, nd one system did not meet our Thiele\u2013Innes relative uncertainty riterion.\nAll 14 systems shared by both samples appear in our class-III samle. Of these, the companion of Gaia DR3 6328149636482597888 as a mass larger than 2 . 4 M and is considered a BH candidate Table 2 ). The remaining 13 are NS candidates, with companion asses between \u223c1.2 and \u223c1 . 8 M .\n.3 Comparison with El-Badry et al. ( 2022 ) candidates\nl-Badry et al. ( 2022 ) also compiled a list of BH candidates based n Gaia DR3 astrometric orbits, using the derived mass ratio of the ystems. Their final list included six targets, including the first two\nystems of our Table 2 class-III sample. Four other systems do not ppear on our list, since their orbital periods are longer than 1000 day.\nEl-Badry et al. ( 2022 ) further embarked on an efficient spectrocopic follow-up campaign to validate their orbital solutions. The rst target of Table 2 , Gaia DR3 4373465352415301632 ( Gaia H1 henceforth), was validated by their spectroscopic follow-up ampaign. As per the writing of this text, Gaia BH1 is the only ona-fide BH detected in DR3 data. The properties of this system re somewhat unexpected. We refer to El-Badry et al. ( 2022 ) for detailed discussion on its properties and the implications of its isco v ery. The second target shared by both candidate lists is Gaia R3 6281177228434199296. As opposed to Gaia BH1, this system as refuted by the follow-up campaign. El-Badry et al. ( 2022 ) also monitored, and consequentially reuted, two additional systems identified in our work: Gaia DR3 509370326763016704 and 6802561484797464832. Hence, out of he first four BH candidates presented in Table 2 , one was confirmed nd three can be deemed as spurious, based on follow-up observaions. See the caveats discussion in Section 6 .\nA TENTATI VE DI STI NCTI ON BETWEE N W D N D N S C A N D I DAT E S\nhe distinction between the WD and the NS in our catalogue is ot trivial because some WDs were found by previous studies o have masses greater than the masses of the least massive NSs e.g. Martinez et al. 2015 ; Caiazzo et al. 2021 ). Furthermore, some ompact secondaries with mass typical of NS might be close binaries omposed of two WDs. Nevertheless, one might be helped in eparating the two populations if some orbital properties of the WD inaries statistically differ from those of the NS binaries. To explore this possibility, we plot in Fig. 8 the orbital eccentricity ersus the secondary mass for all objects in our compact-object ample, except for the eight systems with masses larger than 2 . 4 M . he figure suggests two clusters of binaries \u2013 one with the typical D mass of 0 . 6 M and low eccentricity, and the other with the ypical NS mass of 1 . 2 M and higher eccentricity. To tentati vely di vide the sample into WD and NS candidates, we\ntted the eccentricity\u2013secondary-mass diagram with a component aussian mixture model. 3 The mean Silhouette similarity score Rousseeuw 1987 ) was used to select the number of components\nMNRAS 518, 2991\u20133003 (2023)\nM\ni m v t c t i\nm f d\nw t t c\nT c\nl c r t\n4\nFigure 9.

The most prominent peak, at \u223c0 . 6 M corresponds to WD secondaries in the sample, and another, less prominent peak, is located at \u223c1 . 3 M . We set the upper boundary of the mass axis at 2 . 1 M , for clarity. As a result, 8 additional systems with secondary masses larger than 2 . 4 M are not shown. Lines represent the marginal distributions derived from a Gaussian-mixture model that was fitted to the secondary-mass\u2013eccentricity diagram (see Section 5 ). The o v erlap between the two classes is small, as only one bin shares points from both classes, with two WDs and one NS.\np t 1 a l\no G t c b\nr n c e s s p c s p e\nv c c d G\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2991/6825524 by IN IST-C N R S IN SU user on 08 April 2023\nn the mixture. 4 The score was calculated using the cosine-distance etric, to fa v our the masses\u2013eccentricities relation o v er their actual alues. The Silhouette score became ne gativ e when using more han three Gaussian components, which indicates that the resulting lusters o v erlap. Nev ertheless, we emphasize that this is merely a entative classification, and refer the readers to the caveats discussion n Section 6 . We used two components to describe the distribution of the lowass circularized systems (\u2018WD cluster\u2019) and another component or the massive eccentric ones (\u2018NS cluster\u2019). The WD cluster is escribed by f WD \u223c 0 . 78 N ([ 0 . 572 0 . 083 ] , [ 0 . 004 \u22120 . 0006 \u22120 . 0006 0 . 001 ]) + 0 . 22 N ([ 0 . 60 0 . 22 ] , [ 0 . 01 \u22120 . 006 \u22120 . 006 0 . 02 ]) , (8) here N represents a normal distribution, its first entry representing he derived expectancy for the secondary mass in Solar units (top) and he eccentricity (bottom), and the second entry is the corresponding ovariance matrix. Similarly, the NS cluster is described by\nf NS \u223cN ([\n1 . 29 0 . 43\n] , [ 0 . 07 0 . 01 0 . 01 0 . 05 ]) . (9)\nhe odds ratio between the two clusters is 1.42, in fa v our of the WD luster.\nThe central regions of the two clusters are presented as thin purple ines in Fig. 8 . The points are coloured by their classification: white ircles represent the objects in the WD cluster, and the blue circles epresent the objects in the NS cluster. The distinction between he two clusters was made according to their cluster-membership\nNRAS 518, 2991\u20133003 (2023)\nSee the Scikit-learn Silhouette score function.\nN p a\nrobabilities, f NS and f NS , of the Gaussian mixture model. The 68 argets with f NS > 0 . 5 were labeled as NS cluster members; the 01 targets in the complement set, with f WD > 0 . 5, were labelled s members of the WD cluster. The 8 BH candidates, with masses arger than 2 . 4 M , are not included in any of the two classes.\nFig. 9 presents the mass distribution of the secondary masses, v erlaid with the marginal probability density function of the aussian mixture of Fig. 8 . The solid purple and blue curves represent he distribution of the WD and NS clusters, respectively, and the ombined marginal distribution of the entire sample is shown as a lack dotted line.\nOut of 177 binaries in the sample, 93 have companions in the mass ange of 0 . 45 \u22120 . 75 M . These systems populate a prominent and arrow histogram peak, centred at \u223c0 . 6 M , which is qualitatively onsistent with the observed WD mass distribution (e.g. Tremblay t al. 2016 ; Hollands et al. 2018 ). The histogram also shows a broad econdary peak, centred at \u223c1 . 3 M , probably composed on NS econdaries. Note, ho we ver, that the high-mass wing of the secondary eak contains 24 systems with companions of 1 . 4 \u22122 . 1 M , which ould also be close binaries by themselves composed of two WDs; ee the discussion in Mazeh et al. 2022 ). Additional 48 systems opulate the intermediate mass range of 0 . 75 \u22121 . 4 M , which could ither be NSs or massive WDs.\nFigs 10 and 11 present the secondary mass and eccentricity ersus their orbital period, respectively, for the highly probable lass-III systems in our sample. The points in the figures are oloured according to the tentative mass-eccentricity clustering escribed abo v e. Fig. 10 suggests that (e xcept for two NS cases, aia DR3 4482912934572480384 and 1522897482203494784), the S candidates are confined below some upper envelope in the masseriod diagram. Similarly, Fig. 11 suggests that an upper envelope lso exists in the period-eccentricity plane (except for Gaia DR3\n4 i r\ni G s b t m\nb 2 c a t c W m A e\n5\nF p a t h m o t i i\nt o m S b s s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2991/6825524 by IN IST-C N R S IN SU user on 08 April 2023\n482912934572480384 and 2574867704662509568). The sample ndicates that the compact object\u2019s mass and orbital eccentricity can each larger values as the orbital period lasts longer.\nThe CMD location of the compact-object binaries are presented n Fig. 12 . The figure also shows, for reference, the CMD of the aia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS; Smart et al. 2021 ) for all ystems brighter than 15 in Gaia \u2019s G band. One can see that all the inaries have MS primaries, as required by our analysis. As a rule, he binaries occupy the bluer part of the MS stripe, and some less\nassive WD binaries are even slightly bluer than the edge of the\nInterestingly, some NS cluster members are also located on the lue side of the MS stripe. One obvious outlier is Gaia DR3 469926638416055168, with an absolute magnitude of \u223c7 and olour index of \u223c0.95. This binary is eccentric ( e \u223c 0.75), with n orbital period of \u223c580 day. The primary mass is \u223c0 . 5 M , and he companion is of 1.17 \u00b1 0.14 M . One possibility is that the ompanion is a massive WD or a close binary composed of two Ds that was wrongly classified as an NS in our naive Gaussianixture classification, due to the high eccentricity of the wide orbit. lternativ ely, this discrepanc y could originate from an incorrect stimate of parallax or interstellar extinction.\n.1 Incompleteness of the compact object sample\nig. 13 shows the location of the selected binaries on the AMRF\u2013 rimary-mass plane and illustrates some of the selection biases that ffect this sample. The figure shows that all MS\u2013WD binaries, except wo cases, have primaries less massive than \u223c 0 . 6 M . On the other and, it seems that the MS\u2013NS binaries tend to have primaries more assive than \u223c0 . 7 M . This emerging relationship between the mass f the primary and that of the secondary is probably induced by the riage selection scheme: companions in the WD mass range can be dentified as class-III binaries only if the mass of their primary host s sufficiently low (also see Fig. 2 ).\nThe sample also presents a significant paucity of BH compared o the recent theoretical predictions (e.g. Mashian & Loeb 2017 ); nly eight candidates in the class-III sample have companions more assive than 2 . 4 M , and a few of them were already refuted. upposedly, v ery massiv e non-luminous companions should hav e een easily detected by Gaia . Ho we ver, as Halbwachs et al.

(10) hile Halbwachs et al. ( 2022 ) did not explicitly reject systems based n the value of their mass function, it is plausible that many of the Hs and NSs initially detected by Gaia were indistinguishable from purious solutions and consequentially excluded from Gaia binarytar data base. One possible way of explaining such a bias is by considering he correlation of the parallax error, , with the photocentric emimajor axis, \u03b10 . Consequently, the selection imposed on the arallax significance and the orbital period (see Section 3.1 ) can mplicitly impose a selection effect on the total mass of the system. To llustrate this point, we o v erlaid Fig. 13 with three equal- f M contours. he occurrence rate of the class-III systems appears to be decreasing long the direction perpendicular to these curves, towards high f M alues. While we cannot rule out that this effect is due to the actual nderlying occurrence rates, it is also possible that the population of igh- f M companions was significantly depleted in Gaia DR3. The mass distribution of the compact object candidates in our ample is therefore heavily biased. Ho we ver, while some BH and NS ere probably excluded from DR3 and could only be reco v ered in uture data releases, the case of WDs is different. Many WD binaries robably exist in the Gaia sample but were identified as class-I/II inaries and consequentially eluded detection. We further discuss the dentification of WD secondaries in an accompanying paper.\nSUMMARY A N D DISCUSSION\ne have applied the triage analysis of Shahaf et al. ( 2019 ) to the ecently published sample of Gaia astrometric binaries of NSS. The nalysis divides the astrometric binaries into three classes, class\u2013 systems with MS secondary, class-II \u2013 binaries that are likely o be triple systems, with a close MS binary as the astrometric\nNRAS 518, 2991\u20133003 (2023)\necondary, and class-III \u2013 binaries that probably have a compactbject companion. The analysis was based on three levels of computation. First, e vetted some of the orbits, based on the relative errors of the hiele-Innes astrometric parameters, as published by NSS, and he recommended selection criteria of Halbwachs et al. ( 2022 ). e also rejected binaries with periods longer than 1000 d. Our riteria resulted in 101 380 binaries. Secondly, we adopted a new, onserv ati ve, A TR threshold, based on the MIST stellar evolutionary racks. Finally, we derived the class-II and class-III probability of ach binary, taking into account the uncertainties of the Thiele\u2013Innes arameters and the stellar mass. The main product of this analysis is catalogue of these astrometric binaries with probabilities to be in ach of the classes.\nBased on the classification probabilities, we constructed a small ample of 177 astrometric binaries that are likely to have compact ompanions. For comparison, NSS constructed a larger list of 735 inaries. Another catalogue, by Andrews et al. ( 2022 ), contained 4 systems, and a list of 6 BH candidates (out of which one was ynamically validated) was provided and by El-Badry et al. ( 2022 ). Our sample was chosen such that the expected false-discovery ate is below 10 per cent , so we can place an upper limit on the xpected number of contaminants, assuming all orbital solutions are alid (but see the caveats discussion below). In the context of this ork, contaminants might be hierarchical triples that were falsely dentified as class-III systems. The requirements we adopted made our sample of binaries with robable compact objects rather small and incomplete. It is therefore oo early to use it to draw conclusions regarding the frequency of inaries with dormant compact companions. Ho we ver, we already an see some statistical features, plotted in Figs 8 \u201311 , that seem real nd might be of astrophysical interest.\n.1 WD, NS, and BH binaries\nhe new sample includes eight systems with compact-object masses arger than 2.4 M , probable binaries with BH companions. This lassification is somewhat arbitrary, as the borderline between NSs nd BHs is not clear. In fact, six of these candidates reside in what was onsidered a mass gap between the two types of compact objects (e.g. reidberg et al. 2012 ). Ho we ver, this gap started to fill up recently by asses measured through gravitational waves (e.g. Lam et al. 2022 ; e & Fishbach 2022 ). Half of the BH candidates identified in this work were followedp in a spectroscopic campaign by El-Badry et al. ( 2022 ). One ystem, Gaia BH1, was validated based on its radial-velocity RV) modulation. For a detailed discussion regarding the properties nd astrophysical implications of Gaia BH1, see El-Badry et al. 2022 ). The remaining three were identified as spurious solutions see Table 2 ). Several illuminating examples of erroneous orbital olutions or misclassification, resulting in false detections of BHass companions were also recently discussed by Bashi et al. ( 2022 ) nd El-Badry & Rix ( 2022 ) in the context of Gaia spectroscopic rbits. The validity of this small BH-candidate sample, therefore, requires urther study. As mentioned in Section 5 , most BH candidates ave GoF values higher than \u223c5. One orbital solution, Gaia DR3 588211521163024640, has an exceptionally high eccentricity and n orbital period consistent with \u223c1000 d, which raises suspicions egarding its quality. Validating the orbits of the BH candidates sing data sources external to Gaia DR3 is crucial (see the caveats\nd b\n1 t v c W a o d P p 2 K\np t p b s t B o n\nh t W c V e O o s\nc O a t fi l s b s a K\np a a w p f a 2\nw o H F (\nH w W a e t\nr a S s m m c F t h f W 2 m t S n\ne B p b o o f e c b p o 2\n6\nT b\ni G b s h c s 1 2 t u a v o t p\nt\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2991/6825524 by IN IST-C N R S IN SU user on 08 April 2023\niscussion below). Testing the validity of the astrometric orbits is eyond the scope of this work. The other 169 systems, with companion masses smaller than .85 M , are probably mostly WD or NS binaries. We tried to disinguish between the WD and NS by plotting the orbital eccentricity ersus the deriv ed compact-object mass. The diagram suggests a lear separation between the WD and the NS binaries. Most of the D binaries are characterized by small eccentricities of about 0.1 nd masses of 0.6 M , while the NS binaries display eccentricities f about 0.4 and masses of 1.3 M . The latter feature might be ue to the natal kicks that accompany the NS formation (Hansen & hinney 1997 ; Igoshev & Perets 2019 ), although their underlying hysical mechanism is a matter of ongoing research (Atri et al. 019 ; Callister, Farr & Renzo 2021 ; Willcox et al. 2021 ; Andrews & alogera 2022 ). As a population, the detected binaries in the NS cluster carry the otential of probing the margins of the natal kick velocity distribution hat is assumed to be associated with the NS formation. With orbital eriods of up to a few years and eccentricities below \u223c0.8, these inaries probably represent the products of processes that, while trong enough to induce eccentricity to the orbit, could not disrupt he binary entirely (e.g. Pfahl et al. 2002 ; van den Heuvel 2007 ; eniamini & Piran 2016 ; Tauris et al. 2017 ). The clear dependence f the eccentricity and the NS masses can be used as hints for the ature of the last stages of the orbital formation of these binaries. As opposed to the NS candidates, most binaries in the WD cluster ave small orbital eccentricity (see Figs 8 and 11 ). WDs are expected o be in circularized orbits due to the tidal interaction between the\nD progenitors and their MS companion, and therefore our result ould be of interest (Zahn 1977 ; Izzard, Dermine & Church 2010 ; an der Swaelmen et al. 2017 ; Jorissen et al. 2019 ). Ho we ver, it is too arly to determine whether those small eccentricities are significant. ne could claim, for example, that this is not an inherent property f the sample, as it could originate from the fitting procedure or a ample selection (see the caveats discussion below).\nAs pointed out abo v e, the most striking feature of Figs 10 is the oncentration of the binaries in a period range of about 400\u20131000 d. ne needs to check whether this results from an observational bias, s the longer the period, the larger the semimajor axis is (see e.g. he discussion by Penoyre, Belokurov & Evans 2022 ). Similarly, the gures suggest that upper envelopes of the NS distributions with arger mass and eccentricity for orbits with longer periods have urfaced. If this is not another result of an observational bias, it could e the result of the natal kicks discussed abo v e, which might produce tatistical dependence between the resulting period and the NS mass nd orbital eccentricity (Hills 1983 ; Brandt & Podsiadlowski 1995 ; alogera 1996 ; Dewi, Podsiadlowski & Pols 2005 ). The mass distribution of the WD and NS class-III sample is resented in Fig. 9 (also see fig. 36 of NSS). The advantage of sample of astrometric binaries with compact companions is the bility to dynamically derive the secondary mass of each binary, hich depends only on the primary mass and orbital elements, rovided the secondary is non-luminous. The derived masses of WD, or example, do not depend on evolutionary tracks nor on spectral nalysis (e.g. Bergeron et al. 2019 ; Fantin et al. 2021 ; Torres et al. 021 ; Heintz et al. 2022 ). The secondary-mass histogram presents a sharp peak at \u223c0 . 6 M ,\nith a width of \u223c 0 . 1 M , similar to the peak found in the distribution f the WD in the solar neighbourhood by Tremblay et al. ( 2016 ) and ollands et al. ( 2018 ). We, therefore, can assume that the peak of ig. 9 does reflect the masses of a large sample of WD secondaries see also NSS). It seems as if the WD distribution reported by\nollands et al. ( 2018 ) is wider than the one of Fig. 9 . One might onder if this is because of the more precise determination of the D companion mass by dynamical techniques. In any case, it is\nlso possible that the proximity of the companion through the last volutionary phases leading to the production of WDs might modify he mass of the end product (e.g. Toonen et al. 2014 ).\nThe mass distribution of Fig. 9 includes a wide \u2018wing\u2019 to the ight of the sharp peak, centred around \u223c1 . 3 M , that we identified s NSs, consistent with their expected masses (e.g. Lattimer & teiner 2014 ; O\u0308zel & Freire 2016 ). The mass-eccentricity diagram uggests that within the period range probed by Gaia the WD and NS ass distributions only slightly o v erlap \u2013 compact companions more assive than \u223c1 M are likely to be NS. This observation stands in ontrast with the recent analysis of the Gaia EDR3 catalogue (Gentile usillo et al. 2021 ) that argues that the mass distribution of WDs in he solar neighborhood has a long tail extending to 1 . 2 M and even igher. Ho we ver, the latter distribution was derived for single WDs, or which the massive tail might reflect the result of two merging\nDs (Kilic et al. 2021 ; Miller et al. 2022 ; Fleury, Caiazzo & Heyl 022a , b ). Our tentative separation, on the other hand, is based on the asses of compact companions, for which the binarity did not allow he merging of two WDs in the close proximity of the optical star. uch a distinction might have obvious implications for classifying on-interacting compact objects (see e.g. Mazeh et al. 2022 ). Many binaries with compact secondaries were previously known, ither as cataclysmic variables (e.g. Robinson 1976 ; Knigge, araffe & Patterson 2011 ), X-ray binaries (e.g. Paul 2017 ), or binary ulsars (e.g. Manchester 2017 ). Most of those (except Be/X-ray inaries and a few pulsars) reside in short-period orbits, on the order f hours and days. Most of them were disco v ered by the luminosity f the compact objects or the accretion discs around them, which are uelled by mass transfer from the optical companion or the rotational nergy of the compact object (but see Shenar et al. 2022a , b ). The ompanions sampled here are all dormant, and their identification is ased on the astrometric motion of the optical star only. Their orbital eriods are on the order of a year, allowing a look into another range f periods of the compact-object binaries (see e.g. Saracino et al. 022 ; but also El-Badry & Burdge 2022 ).\n.2 Caveats\nhere are several caveats to our analysis, which we briefly address elow. Foremost, despite our cautious approach, the validity of the orbits s still in doubt. The sample of astrometric binaries detected by aia probably includes some false disco v eries, as an y other data ase would. Ho we ver, as was sho wn by Halbwachs et al. ( 2022 ), the purious orbital solutions detected by Gaia are often characterized by igh-mass functions. As a result, samples of massive non-luminous ompanions found in the NSS catalogue should be treated with ome caution. Furthermore, the very nature of the Gaia astrometric D measurements (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016 ; Pourbaix et al. 022 ), the relatively small number of observations, and the fact hat DR3 does not include the individual measurements imply that nambiguous detection of extremely rare systems based on DR3 data lone is challenging. Therefore, the orbits in our sample should be alidated by RV follo w-up observ ations, for example. The amplitude f the expected modulation should be on the order of 30 km s \u22121 , and herefore, a fe w lo w-resolution observ ations, close to the quadrature hases, when the RVs get their extreme values, should suffice. Second, our analysis relies on Gaia \u2019s reported masses, along with heir uncertainty estimates (NSS). Erroneous estimates of the primary\nMNRAS 518, 2991\u20133003 (2023)\nM\nm T 5 s c t f s\nt n k f o d b\nt d g w o t f p\nA\nW a t J T f o a d H\n( b h t t A\ns s e W c a c t N\nS 2\nD\nA\nR\nA A\nA A A A A A B B B B B\nB B B C C C\nC\nC\nC C D\nD D E E E E F F F F\nG G G G H H H H\nH\nH H\nH I I J J\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/2/2991/6825524 by IN IST-C N R S IN SU user on 08 April 2023\nasses can significantly bias the companion mass distribution. his was recently demonstrated for the NS candidate Gaia DR3 136025521527939072 reported by NSS. The primary mass of this ystem was probably o v er estimated and as a result so was that of its ompanion (see El-Badry et al. 2022 ). Therefore, it will be important o use external estimates for the stellar parameters, via spectroscopy rom the LAMOST (Cui et al. 2012 ) or GALAH (Buder et al. 2021 ) urv e ys, for example.\nThird, we emphasize that our tentative Gaussian mixture classificaion, separating between WD and NS candidates, is only of statistical ature. It does not account for uncertainties in the data, the prior nowledge of the physical properties, nor any additional data apart rom their mass and eccentricity. To draw more specific conclusions, ne might also wish to consider, for example, the spectral energy istribution, chemical composition, and Galactic trajectory of these inaries. Looking into the future, when the next Gaia release arrives, he number of observations gets larger, and the whole astrometric ata are released. Furthermore, the time span of the observations ets longer, and the sample of binaries grows substantially. We ill then be able to estimate the validity of the orbits and the bservational threshold for astrometric detection, deriving the staistical features of the compact-object binaries, particularly the requency of the compact-object binaries as a function of their orbital eriod.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the referee, Zephyr Penoyre, for the thoughtful comments nd suggestions that helped us impro v ed the original manuscript.
