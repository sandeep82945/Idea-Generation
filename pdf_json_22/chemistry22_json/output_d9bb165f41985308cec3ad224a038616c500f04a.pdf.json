    "abstractText": "Leishmaniases are among the most impacting neglected tropical diseases. In attempts to repurpose antimalarial drugs or candidates, it was found that selected 1,2,4-trioxanes, 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes, and pyrazole-containing chemotypes demonstrated activity against Leishmania parasites. This study reports the synthesis and structure of trioxolane\u2013pyrazole (OZ1, OZ2) and tetraoxane\u2013pyrazole (T1, T2) hybrids obtained from the reaction of 3(5)-aminopyrazole with endoperoxide-containing building blocks. Interestingly, only the endocyclic amine of 3(5)-aminopyrazole was found to act as nucleophile for amide coupling. However, the fate of the reaction was influenced by prototropic tautomerism of the pyrazole heterocycle, yielding 3and 5-aminopyrazole containing hybrids which were characterized by different techniques, including X-ray crystallography. The compounds were evaluated for in vitro antileishmanial activity against promastigotes of L. tropica and L. infantum, and for cytotoxicity against THP-1 cells. Selected compounds were also evaluated against intramacrophage amastigote forms of L. infantum. Trioxolane\u2013pyrazole hybrids OZ1 and OZ2 exhibited some activity against Leishmania promastigotes, while tetraoxane\u2013pyrazole hybrids proved inactive, most likely due to solubility issues. Eight salt forms, specifically tosylate, mesylate, and hydrochloride salts, were then prepared to improve the solubility of the corresponding peroxide hybrids and were uniformly tested. Biological evaluations in promastigotes showed that the compound OZ1\u2022HCl was the most active against both strains of Leishmania. Such finding was corroborated by the results obtained in assessments of the L. infantum amastigote susceptibility. It is noteworthy that the salt forms of the endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids displayed a broader spectrum of action, showing activity in both strains of Leishmania. Our preliminary biological findings encourage further optimization of peroxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids to identify a promising antileishmanial lead.",

Infections are caused by intracellular protozoans belonging to the genus Leishmania, from which more than 20 infective species are known worldwide [1\u20133]. Epidemiological data estimate 1.5 to 2 million new cases annually, with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) accounting for 500,000 cases and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) for 1 to 1.5 million cases [4]. Antileishmanial chemotherapy relies on a restricted arsenal of drugs comprising antimony-salts, paromomycin, miltefosine, and amphotericin B, all of which have serious\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5401. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27175401 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5401 2 of 23\nshortcomings, such as unwanted side effects, unsatisfactory administration routes, and high cost and are also facing decreasing efficacy due to the emergence of resistances. These drawbacks prompted the search for better options to address leishmaniasis treatment [1,5]. Recently, it was demonstrated that selected synthetic 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes and 1,2,4- trioxolanes exhibit antiparasitic activity against Leishmania spp. (Figure 1A) [1,5\u20138]. These endoperoxide classes have been extensively explored as an alternative to the natural compound artemisinin in the fight against malaria [9\u201313]. As for endoperoxides, the limelight of pyrazoles is prominent in the medicinal scope, extending their anti-inflammatory [14], antineoplastic [15], antiviral [16], and antileishmanial activity (Figure 1A) [17]. The pyrazole moiety exhibits prototropic tautomerism, leading to distinctive pyrazole-based structures with diverse reactivities [18]; so this class remains under intense scrutiny

moieties, preferentially those acting through a different mechanism of action, to generate hybrids that integrate multiple pharmacophores in a single chemical entity, thus enabling the development of endoperoxide-based multi-target drugs [21]. This approach aims to increase effectiveness through a synergistic effect and to delay resistance selection. The linker between the pharmacophoric moieties can be tailored to adjust the drug\u2019s pharmacokinetic performance and bioavailability [22,23]. Given the potential of endoperoxides and pyrazoles as tools against parasitic diseases, namely malaria and leishmaniases, we propose to explore endoperoxide\u2013 pyrazole hybrids. In this work, we disclose the synthesis and structure of 1,2,4,5-tetraoxane\u2013 pyrazole (T1, T2) and 1,2,4-trioxolane\u2013pyrazole (OZ1, OZ2) hybrids (Figure 1B). The structures of the tetraoxane-based hybrids (5-amino-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)(dispiro[cyclohexane-1,3\u2032[1,2,4,5]tetraoxane-6\u2032,2\u201d-tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan]-4-yl)methanone (T1) and (3-amino-1Hpyrazol-1-yl)(dispiro[cyclohexane-1,3\u2032-[1,2,4,5]tetraoxane-6\u2032,2\u201d-tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan]-4yl)methanone (T2) were elucidated by X-ray crystallography. We conducted studies to evaluate the activity of the hybrids against Leishmania infantum, responsible for both CL and VL, and Leishmania tropica, responsible for CL [24,25], to explore novel antiparasitic candidates. By synthesizing and fully characterizing these novel compounds, we intended to explore their activity against protozoan parasites using Leishmania spp. as first models.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5401 3 of 23"

The synthetic strategies adopted for both classes are depicted in Schemes 1 and 2.\nThe detailed procedures for their preparation and characterization are described in the Sec-\ntion 3 and Supporting Information (SI). The main difference between these syntheses resides in the method used to produce the endoperoxide pharmacophore. Formation of the 1,2,4- trioxolane ring relies on a Griesbaum coozonolysis, using adamantan-2-one O-methyloxime 1o, 4-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate, and ozone to yield the expected 1,2,4-trioxolane intermediate 2o. The adamantan-2-one O-methyl-oxime 1o employed in this procedure was previously synthesized from the reaction of adamantan-2-one with O-methylhydroxylamine in pyridine and methanol (Scheme 1). The method described by Amado et al. [26] was followed for the preparation of the precursor 1,2,4,5-tetraoxane 2t, starting with the peroxyacetalization of ethyl 4-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate with 50% (w/w) aqueous hydrogen peroxide in acetonitrile in the presence of the silica sulfuric acid catalyst (SSA) to afford the crude dihydroperoxide (DHP, 1t). Cyclocondensation of crude DHP 1t with adamantan-2one catalysed by SSA produced the desired 1,2,4,5-tetraoxane 2t (Scheme 2). Hydrolysis of trioxolane-ester 2o or tetraoxane-ester 2t with lithium hydroxide in THF/H2O afforded the corresponding carboxylic acids, trioxolane 3o or tetraoxane 3t (Schemes 1 and 2). Endoperoxide carboxylic acids (3o or 3t) were then reacted with 3-aminopyrazole under an inert atmosphere in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC\u00b7HCl) and hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), as coupling agents, and triethylamine, to yield a mixture of 1,2,4-trioxolane\u2013pyrazole or 1,2,4,5-tetraoxane\u2013pyrazole positional isomers (OZ1 and OZ2 or T1 and T2, Schemes 1 and 2).\nMolecules\u00a02022,\u00a027,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 25\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0Results\u00a0and\u00a0Discussion\u00a0 2.1.\u00a0Synthesis\u00a0and\u00a0Structure\u00a0Analysis\u00a0\nThe\u00a0 novel\u00a0 1,2,4\u2010trioxolane\u2013pyrazoles\u00a0 OZ1/OZ2\u00a0 and\u00a0 1,2,4,5\u2010tetraoxane\u2013pyrazoles\u00a0 T1/T2\u00a0were\u00a0 synthesized\u00a0by\u00a0 adapting\u00a0procedures\u00a0described\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 literature,\u00a0 and\u00a0 their\u00a0 complete\u00a0 structure\u00a0 elucidation\u00a0 was\u00a0 achieved\u00a0 by\u00a0 1H,\u00a0 13C{1H},\u00a0 2D\u00a0 NMR,\u00a0 X\u2010ray\u00a0 crystallography,\u00a0and\u00a0HRMS.\u00a0The\u00a0synthetic\u00a0strategies\u00a0adopted\u00a0for\u00a0both\u00a0classes\u00a0are\u00a0depicted\u00a0 in\u00a0Schemes\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a02.\u00a0The\u00a0detailed\u00a0procedures\u00a0for\u00a0their\u00a0preparation\u00a0and\u00a0characterization\u00a0are\u00a0 described\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0Materials\u00a0 and\u00a0Methods\u00a0 section\u00a0 and\u00a0Supporting\u00a0 Information\u00a0 (SI).\u00a0The\u00a0 main\u00a0 difference\u00a0 between\u00a0 these\u00a0 syntheses\u00a0 resides\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0method\u00a0 used\u00a0 to\u00a0 produce\u00a0 the\u00a0 endoperoxide\u00a0 pharmacophore.\u00a0 Formation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 1,2,4\u2010trioxolane\u00a0 ring\u00a0 relies\u00a0 on\u00a0 a\u00a0 Griesbaum\u00a0 coozonolysis,\u00a0 using\u00a0 adamantan\u20102\u2010one\u00a0 O\u2010methyloxime\u00a0 1o,\u00a0 4\u2010 oxocyclohexanecarboxylate,\u00a0and\u00a0ozone\u00a0to\u00a0yield\u00a0the\u00a0expected\u00a01,2,4\u2010trioxolane\u00a0intermediate\u00a0 2o.\u00a0The\u00a0adamantan\u20102\u2010one\u00a0O\u2010methyl\u2010oxime\u00a01o\u00a0employed\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0procedure\u00a0was\u00a0previously\u00a0 synthesized\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 reaction\u00a0 of\u00a0 adamantan\u20102\u2010one\u00a0 with\u00a0 O\u2010methylhydroxylamine\u00a0 in\u00a0 pyridine\u00a0 and\u00a0methanol\u00a0 (Scheme\u00a0 1).\u00a0 The\u00a0method\u00a0 described\u00a0 by\u00a0Amado\u00a0 et\u00a0 al.\u00a0 [26]\u00a0was\u00a0 followed\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 preparation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 precursor\u00a0 1,2,4,5\u2010tetraoxane\u00a0 2t,\u00a0 starting\u00a0with\u00a0 the\u00a0 peroxyacetalization\u00a0 of\u00a0 ethyl\u00a0 4\u2010oxocyclohexanecarboxylate\u00a0 with\u00a0 50%\u00a0 (w/w)\u00a0 aqueous\u00a0 hydrogen\u00a0peroxide\u00a0in\u00a0acetonitrile\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0silica\u00a0sulfuric\u00a0acid\u00a0catalyst\u00a0(SSA)\u00a0 to\u00a0afford\u00a0the\u00a0crude\u00a0dihydroperoxide\u00a0(DHP,\u00a01t).\u00a0Cyclocondensation\u00a0of\u00a0crude\u00a0DHP\u00a01t\u00a0with\u00a0 adamantan\u20102\u2010one\u00a0catalysed\u00a0by\u00a0SSA\u00a0produced\u00a0the\u00a0desired\u00a01,2,4,5\u2010tetraoxane\u00a02t\u00a0(Scheme\u00a02).\u00a0 Hydrolysis\u00a0 of\u00a0 trioxolane\u2010ester\u00a0 2o\u00a0 or\u00a0 tetraoxane\u2010ester\u00a0 2t\u00a0 with\u00a0 lithium\u00a0 hydroxide\u00a0 in\u00a0 THF/H2O\u00a0 afforded\u00a0 the\u00a0 corresponding\u00a0 carboxylic\u00a0 acids,\u00a0 trioxolane\u00a0 3o\u00a0 or\u00a0 tetraoxane\u00a0 3t\u00a0 (Schemes\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a02).\u00a0Endoperoxide\u00a0carboxylic\u00a0acids\u00a0 (3o\u00a0or\u00a03t)\u00a0were\u00a0 then\u00a0reacted\u00a0with\u00a03\u2010 aminopyrazole\u00a0 under\u00a0 an\u00a0 inert\u00a0 atmosphere\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 presence\u00a0 of\u00a0 1\u2010ethyl\u20103\u2010(3\u2010 (dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide\u00a0 hydrochloride\u00a0 (EDC\u2219HCl)\u00a0 and\u00a0 hydroxybenzotriazole\u00a0(HOBt),\u00a0as\u00a0coupling\u00a0agents,\u00a0and\u00a0triethylamine,\u00a0to\u00a0yield\u00a0a\u00a0mixture\u00a0 of\u00a01,2,4\u2010trioxolane\u2013pyrazole\u00a0or\u00a01,2,4,5\u2010tetraoxane\u2013pyrazole\u00a0positional\u00a0isomers\u00a0(OZ1\u00a0and\u00a0 Z2\u00a0or\u00a0T1\u00a0and\u00a0T2,\u00a0Schemes\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a02).\u00a0\n\u00a0 Scheme\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Reagents\u00a0 and\u00a0 conditions:\u00a0 (a)\u00a0 pyridine,\u00a0 MeONH2,\u00a0 MeOH,\u00a0 r.t,\u00a0 72\u00a0 h;\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 ethyl\u00a0 4\u2010 oxocyclohexanecarboxylate,\u00a0O3,\u00a0DCM/Pentane,\u00a00\u00a0\u00b0C,\u00a02\u00a0h;\u00a0(c)\u00a0LiOH,\u00a0THF/H2O,\u00a0rt,\u00a0o/n;\u00a0(d)\u00a0EDC.HCl,\u00a0 HOBt,\u00a0Et3N,\u00a0CH2Cl2,\u00a0rt,\u00a0o/n.\u00a0\nScheme 1.

Generally, in the tetraoxane dispiro system, the 13C{1H} peaks expand due to conformational flipping between the dispiro-cyclohexyl rings, resulting in the broadening of the peaks and a reduction in the number of carbons associated with those respective rings\u2019 carbons. These observations are more frequent in six-membered ring endoperoxides, such as 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes or 1,2,4-trioxanes [27]. Compared to the tetraoxane analogues, dispiro 1,2,4-trioxolanes exhibit much improved signal resolution and sharpness and a higher signal number in the non-aromatic region. As expected, a strong correlation coefficient was obtained in the 1H\u22121H COSY and HMBC spectra for endoperoxide containing dispiro rings. Furthermore, the combination of the 1H\u22121H COSY and HMBC spectra allowed for the complete identification of the pyrazole moiety\u2019s carbons, enabling a more precise identification of the multiple -NH protons. Regarding the pyrazole ring, in the 1H\u22121H COSY spectrum, 3J correlations between H4 with H5 were observed, together with two long-range couplings with one of the -NH proton (\u03b4 = 5.54 ppm), including a four-bond coupling (4J) with H4 and a five-bond coupling (5J) with H5 in both isomers OZ1/T1 (Figures S14 and S25, SI). HMBC 3JC-NH correlations between each -NH (\u03b4 = 5.19 and 5.54 ppm) with C4 demonstrated that both isomers OZ1 and T1 have two signals in C4, implying the presence of two non-equivalent -NH protons. No HMBC 3JC-NH\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5401 5 of 23\ncorrelation was observed between the carbonyl carbon and the -NH from the pyrazole ring, suggesting that the exocyclic amino group did not participate in the amide generation in isomers OZ1/T1 (Figures S16 and S27, SI). These correlations indicate that a prototropic annular tautomerism [18,28] occurred during the coupling reaction, where isomers OZ1/T1 are the products from reaction of the peroxide carboxylic acids with the 5-aminopyrazole tautomer. Protons -NH are described as non-equivalent, implying a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond involving one of the exocyclic -NH protons.\nTable 2.

A five-bond coupling (5J) correlation is observed between H5 and -NH2 in isomer T2 (Figure S31, SI). Regarding HMBC spectrum, a single signal 3JC-NH in C3-NH2 to C4 is observed, which demonstrates that both -NH protons are equivalent. A weak 2JC-H correlation in C3-NH2 to C3 was also observed in isomer T2 (Figure S33, SI). Notably, the data demonstrate the presence of the conjugate in its 3-aminopyrazole-linked tautomeric form, which is identifiable in the crystal phase. Theoretically, the frame of 3(5)-aminopyrazole is also susceptible to side-chain tautomerism, as it has a proton-exchangeable amine side chain [18,28], which can be observed in this situation."

The crystal of T1 used for the data collection turned out to be a non-merohedral twin corresponding to a 180\u25e6 rotation around the (100) reciprocal lattice axis; the twinlaw (1 0 0.860; 0 \u22121 0; 0 0 \u22121) was found using the TwinRotMax routine implemented in PLATON [29]. The proportion of the two components of the twin was found to be 59%:41% via refinement of the BASF parameter.

Displacement ellipsoids are drawn at the 50% probability level. The tetraoxane group has min r disorder over two alternate chair conformations; for the sake of clarity, only the major conformation is shown.\nBond length and valency angles are unexceptional, the average values in the tetraoxane ring being C\u2013O (I: 1.429 \u00c5; II: 1.430 \u00c5), O\u2013O, (I: 1.474 \u00c5; II: 1.476 \u00c5) and C\u2013O\u2013O (I: 107.8; II: 107.1\u25e6), respectively. In T2, the cyclohexane and tetraoxane rings dopt both n almost ideal chair form, with Cremer and Pople [30] puckering parameters Q: ~0.6 \u00c5 and pseudo-rot ti angle \u03b8 < 2\u25e6. In the case f T1, the puckering amplitudes of these rings are similar to those f T2, and the conformation of the tetraoxan ring is also close to the ideal chair form, with \u03b8 = 1.7(6)\u25e6. However, the cyclohexane ring in T1 features a significant dis rtion from the ideal chair co f rmation, with \u03b8 = 11.3(10)\u25e6 For both isomers, the subtituent at C14 is at an equatorial position to the cyclohexane ring. T conformation f the adamantane substituent is close to the ideal boat\u2013boat form of the forming eight-membered rings, with approximate Cs sy m try, in the two crystals. Th pyrazole ri g is planar within xperimental error in both isomers. The C=O grou is not strictly coplanar with the pyrazole ring, with a more pronounced rotati n a ound the si gle N1\u2013C17 bond in T2, as shown by the torsion angles O5\u2013C17\u2013N1\u2013N2 (I: \u2212175.9(8)\u25e6; II 167.90(12)\u25e6). In the crystal of T1, one of the two H atoms of the amino group forms a short intramolecular hydrogen bond with the bare O5 atom as acceptor (Table 3). The other H atom establishes a longer intermolecular hydrogen bond with the bare N atom of the pyrazole ring of a neighbor molecule, this hydrogen bond linking the molecules in infinite chains propagating along the crystallographic c-axis (Figure 4). In the crystal structure of T2, both\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5401 7 of 23\nH atoms of the amino group are involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonds; one of them is an N\u2013H . . . N bond linking molecules across inversion centers in the unit cell; the other one is directed towards atom O5, as in the crystal of T1. In T2, the two hydrogen bonds form an infinite 2D network of molecules lying in the (100) plane (Figure 5). In both crystals, a set of C\u2013H . . . O and C\u2013H . . . N short contacts can be spotted, as well as C\u2013H . . .

            "text": "We undertook a preliminary in vitro evaluation of the antileishmanial activity of the endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids OZ1, OZ2, T1, T2, and 3-aminopyrazole (PYR) against promastigote forms of the viscerotropic species L. infantum and the dermotropic species L. tropica. Axenic Leishmania promastigotes were used as a model for the initial compound screening, since they are a more straightforward and economical model due to their ease of culture development, requiring small amounts of the tested molecule [31]. The halfinhibitory concentration (IC50) of each compound was determined upon 48 h incubation with each parasite strain (Table 4). As control, the standard antileishmanial drug amphotericin B (AmB) was used. Compounds cytotoxicity was assessed (CC50) on the monocytic THP-1 cell line upon exposure to each compound, and the ClogP and ClogS values were calculated (Table 4). Materials and methodologies applied in the biological evaluation of the compounds are described in the Section 3.\nTable 4. Estimated ClogP and ClogS values, cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) in THP-1 cell line, inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in promastigotes of L. infantum and L. tropica and intracellular amastigotes of

Since both zonides have a simila value of ClogS, the lack of\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5401 9 of 23\nactivity of OZ1 in L. infantum could be related to steric effects. Disparity in response to standard CL treatments or experimental drugs has become a significant burden to disease management and variations in treatment outcomes are ascribed to a number of factors, including specific characteristics and susceptibility among Leishmania species [32]; L. tropica and L. infantum are phylogenetically and genetically distinct, which justifies the appearance of different clinical forms as well as variable pharmacological susceptibility among species [33]. The calculated partition coefficient (ClogP) values proved very similar among the endoperoxides studied (1.79\u20132.61), suggesting that other physical properties could explain the differences in activity. Overall, both ozonides demonstrated some antileishmanial activity, though lower than disclosed from previous in vitro studies where selected endoperoxides revealed antileishmanial potency at low micromolar (<10 \u00b5M) concentrations [5,34]. In the present study, the evaluation of compounds T1 and T2 was limited by their low solubility in M199 and RPMI medium. Calculated intrinsic aqueous solubility (ClogS) values show similar values between trioxolanes (1.20\u20131.38) and tetraoxanes (1.18\u20131.21). However, the poor solubility of dispiro 4\u2032\u2019-substituted tetraoxanes may be associated to their structural symmetry [35]. A decrease in molecular symmetry has been correlated to better physicochemical properties, such as absorption and solubility, resulting in enhanced systemic exposure to a drug. So it is anticipated that 3\u2032\u2019-substituted analogues could overcome this solubility issue [35,36]. Therefore, future optimization to 3\u201d-substituted analogues should be considered. Likewise, conversion of the compounds into water-soluble salts, as well as encapsulation of the endoperoxide structures in delivery systems such as liposomes, could represent alternative strategies to solve the solubility issue [37,38]. Cytotoxicity tests revealed toxic effects of the hybrids OZ1 and OZ2 on THP1 cells, with low selectivity (SI values of <5 \u00b5M). We observed that the parent 3- aminopyrazole (PYR) is devoid of antileishmanial activity but exhibits similar toxicity to OZ2, indicating that the toxicity in OZ1 and OZ2 is likely due to the aminopyrazole moiety. Moreover, the efficacy of PYR in inhibiting THP-1 (202 \u00b1 10 \u00b5M), a monocytic leukemia human-derived cell line, also indicates that it could be a promising framework in the design of compounds with antineoplastic potential."

            "text": "To evaluate the effect promoted by endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids on Leishmania morphology, which can impair its infection capacity, we performed a morphometric analysis with optical microscopy (1000\u00d7 amplification) in L. tropica promastigotes treated for 48 h with 300 \u00b5M of OZ1 and 200 \u00b5M of OZ2 as these concentrations were close to the IC50 values obtained for this species (219 \u00b1 25 and 161 \u00b1 19 \u00b5M, respectively). Figure 6 illustrates the measurements of L. tropica body (A) and flagellum (B) of parasites treated with both compounds and the control drug amphotericin B in comparison with non-treated parasites. Results show significant differences p < 0.001 for both compounds. Despite exhibiting a higher IC50 than OZ2, compound OZ1 induced a greater reduction in body size (5.265 \u00b1 1.733 \u00b5m) than OZ2 (9.646 \u00b1 2.744 \u00b5m), even slightly more pronounced than amphotericin B (6.463 \u00b1 1.874 \u00b5m). On the other hand, both molecules decreased the flagellum size, with effects within the same range for OZ2 (12.404 \u00b1 3.745 \u00b5m) and OZ1 (13.561 \u00b1 3.535 \u00b5m). In general, changes in flagellum size are less evident when compared to body size loss; nevertheless, they may limit mobility and its capacity in infecting cells.

Contrarywise, in cultures treated with OZ1 (Figure 7C,D) and OZ2 (Figure 7E,F), most promastigotes showed considerable damage, namely significant body size reduction with an abnormally rounded shape, cytoplasmic disintegration, apparent disruption of internal organelles, and cell shrinkage, which are the typical alterations observed upon treatment with established antileishmanial compounds [39]. Another parallel impact of these compounds is the flagellum length reduction as discussed previously, which may cause impairments in motility. As expected, all these constraints were also observed in promastigotes treated with amphotericin B (Figure 7B). Even though the IC50 values indicated that the ozonides have some activity, microscopic analysis revealed that L. tropica promastigotes experienced cell changes analogous to those caused by amphotericin B. These findings could support further investigations on the endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids in the frame of leishmaniases chemotherapy, underlining the need for structure\u2013activity studies and further optimisation."

Because solubility may play a significant role in the antileishmanial activity of this series of molecules, we converted the free amines attached to the pyrazole moiety into their salt forms. Several acids, namely p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, and hydrochloric acid, can generate the free amines into salts with variable solubility levels. As such, the endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids OZ1, OZ2, T1 and T2 were converted into their p-tosylate (OZ1\u2022TsOH, OZ2\u2022TsOH, and T1\u2022TsOH), mesylate (OZ1\u2022MsOH), and hydrochloride (OZ1\u2022HCl, OZ2\u2022HCl, T1\u2022HCl, and T2\u2022HCl) salts, with low to good yields (Scheme 3). Interestingly, this study has shown that the endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids are stable even in strongly acidic conditions without decomposition of the endoperoxide ring, allowing further structure optimization.

Preparation of different salt forms from the endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5401 12 of 23\nTests of antileishmanial activity were conducted on promastigote forms of L. tropica and L. infantum, then also on intracellular amastigote forms of L. infantum to ascertain the effect of the endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids in their salt forms. The results are depicted in Table 5. The different salts displayed different antileishmanial efficacy depending on the conjugate salt, with IC50 values ranging from 135\u2013 > 400 \u00b5M against L. tropica, and from 164\u2013 > 400 \u00b5M against L. infantum. Among the salt forms of endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids tested against L. tropica promastigotes the trioxolane OZ1\u2022HCl displayed an IC50 value of 135 \u00b1 36 \u00b5M, indicating that different salts of the same isomer exhibit divergent antileishmanial activities, with the OZ1\u2022HCl salt proving to be the most active salt against L. tropica. Unlike for the results obtained for OZ1, OZ2, T1 and T2, the assessments performed on L. infantum promastigotes revealed susceptibility of this strain towards most of the different salts except for the T1 analog with TsOH and HCl. As observed for L. tropica, the trioxolane OZ1\u2022HCl also displayed the lowest IC50 value (164 \u00b1 20 \u00b5M) against L. infantum. Cytotoxicity assessments revealed toxic effects of all the salt derivatives on THP-1 cells, with CC50 values compressed in a concentration range of 331\u2013529 \u00b5M. The improvements in solubility exhibited by the different salts enhanced the antileishmanial activity, although further structure\u2013activity optimizations are still needed. However, it is worth noting that the salt forms of the endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids display a broader spectrum of action, showing some effect on both strains of Leishmania.\nCompounds that exhibited an IC50 < 200 \u00b5M were also tested for intracellular Leishmania amastigotes susceptibility. The L. infantum strain was used as the model for this assay. According to the results of intracellular amastigote susceptibility (Tables 4 and 5), OZ1\u2022HCl and IC0 (2t) demonstrated superior activity compared to the other compounds, with lower IC50 values against intracellular amastigotes (87 \u00b1 39 \u00b5M and 45 \u00b1 28 \u00b5M) than in promastigotes (164 \u00b1 20 \u00b5M and 128 \u00b1 27 \u00b5M). In contrast, OZ1\u2022TsOH, OZ1\u2022MsOH and LC67 evidenced a diminished effect on amastigotes compared to that shown on promastigotes (Figure 8). Possible reasons could be linked to bioaccumulation and mechanism of action for this class of compounds, including passage through the host cell\u2019s cellular membrane or the formation of toxic metabolites toward Leishmania after metabolization of these compounds by host cell enzymes. As reported, the parasitophorous vacuole may serve as a barrier to direct interaction with the parasite, which was reported to eventually lead to a decrease in activity on moving from promastigote to amastigote stages [40]. Thus, it is noteworthy that OZ1\u2022HCl and IC0 (2t) demonstrated superior activity compared to the other compounds, with slightly lower IC50 values against intracellular amastigotes than in promastigotes. Overall, the compounds tested against the amastigote forms displayed poor selectivity since SI values are smaller than 10.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5401 13 of 23\nMolecules\u00a02022,\u00a027,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 14\u00a0 of\u00a0 25\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nmay\u00a0serve\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0barrier\u00a0to\u00a0direct\u00a0interaction\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0parasite,\u00a0which\u00a0was\u00a0reported\u00a0to\u00a0even\u2010 tually\u00a0 lead\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0decrease\u00a0 in\u00a0activity\u00a0on\u00a0moving\u00a0from\u00a0promastigote\u00a0to\u00a0amastigote\u00a0stages\u00a0 [40].\u00a0Thus,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0noteworthy\u00a0that\u00a0OZ1\u2022HCl\u00a0and\u00a0IC0\u00a0(2t)\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0superior\u00a0activity\u00a0 compared\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0other\u00a0compounds,\u00a0with\u00a0slightly\u00a0 lower\u00a0IC50\u00a0values\u00a0against\u00a0 intracellular\u00a0 amastigotes\u00a0than\u00a0in\u00a0promastigotes.\u00a0Overall,\u00a0the\u00a0compounds\u00a0tested\u00a0against\u00a0the\u00a0amastigote\u00a0 forms\u00a0displayed\u00a0poor\u00a0selectivity\u00a0since\u00a0SI\u00a0values\u00a0are\u00a0smaller\u00a0than\u00a010.\u00a0 Table\u00a05.\u00a0Cytotoxic\u00a0concentrations\u00a0(CC50)\u00a0in\u00a0THP\u20101\u00a0cell\u00a0line,\u00a0inhibitory\u00a0concentrations\u00a0(IC50)\u00a0in\u00a0pro\u2010 mastigote\u00a0forms\u00a0of\u00a0L.\u00a0infantum\u00a0and\u00a0L.\u00a0tropica,\u00a0and\u00a0in\u00a0intracellular\u00a0amastigote\u00a0forms\u00a0of\u00a0L.\u00a0infantum\u00a0 and\u00a0selective\u00a0index\u00a0(SI)\u00a0of\u00a0synthetic\u00a0endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole\u00a0salts.\u00a0 Compounds\u00a0 Promastigotes\u00a0Susceptibility\u00a0IC50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0 SEM\u00a0a\u00a0(\u03bc\u039c)\u00a0 Cytotoxicity\u00a0 \u00a0 CC50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM\u00a0a\u00a0 (\u03bc\u039c)\u00a0 Intracellular\u00a0 Amastigotes\u00a0Susceptibil\u2010 ity\u00a0IC50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM\u00a0b\u00a0(\u03bc\u039c)\u00a0 SI\u00a0c\u00a0\nL.\u00a0tropica\u00a0 L.\u00a0infantum\u00a0 L.\u00a0infantum\u00a0 OZ1\u2022TsOH\u00a0 199\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0 181\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035\u00a0 510\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0109\u00a0 246\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032\u00a0 2.1\u00a0 OZ1\u2022MsOH\u00a0 198\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00a0 183\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048\u00a0 336\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0196\u00a0 >400\u00a0 <0.8\u00a0 OZ1\u2022HCl\u00a0 135\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036\u00a0 164\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0 509\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0155\u00a0 87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a039\u00a0 5.9\u00a0 OZ2\u2022TsOH\u00a0 260\u00a0\u00b1\u00a082\u00a0 217\u00a0\u00b1\u00a047\u00a0 479\u00a0\u00b1\u00a083\u00a0 ND\u00a0 ND\u00a0 OZ2\u2022HCl\u00a0 >400\u00a0 258\u00a0\u00b1\u00a091\u00a0 425\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0104\u00a0 ND\u00a0 ND\u00a0 T1\u2022TsOH\u00a0 >400\u00a0 >400\u00a0 331\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0126\u00a0 ND\u00a0 ND\u00a0 T1\u2022HCl\u00a0 >400\u00a0 >400\u00a0 529\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0108\u00a0 ND\u00a0 ND\u00a0 T2\u2022HCl\u00a0 266\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0 313\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040\u00a0 444\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022\u00a0 ND\u00a0 ND\u00a0\na\u00a0SEM:\u00a0Standard\u00a0error\u00a0of\u00a0mean\u00a0of\u00a0at\u00a0least\u00a0three\u00a0independent\u00a0assays;\u00a0b\u00a0SEM:\u00a0standard\u00a0error\u00a0of\u00a0mean\u00a0 of\u00a0two\u00a0independent\u00a0assays;\u00a0c\u00a0SI\u00a0for\u00a0amastigote\u00a0forms;\u00a0ND:\u00a0not\u00a0defined.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a08.\u00a0Graphic\u00a0representation\u00a0of\u00a0cytotoxic\u00a0(CC50)\u00a0and\u00a0inhibitory\u00a0concentrations\u00a0(IC50)\u00a0for\u00a0THP1\u00a0\ncell\u00a0line,\u00a0promastigotes,\u00a0and\u00a0amastigotes\u00a0of\u00a0L.\u00a0infantum,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0\n3.\u00a0Materials\u00a0and\u00a0Methods\u00a0 3.1.\u00a0Chemicals\u00a0\nAll\u00a0reagents\u00a0for\u00a0synthesis\u00a0were\u00a0purchased\u00a0from\u00a0commercial\u00a0sources\u00a0and\u00a0used\u00a0with\u2010 out\u00a0further\u00a0purification.\u00a0Analytical\u00a0thin\u00a0layer\u00a0chromatography\u00a0(TLC)\u00a0was\u00a0carried\u00a0out\u00a0us\u2010 ing\u00a0Merck\u00a0(Darmstadt,\u00a0Germany)\u00a0TLC\u00a0Silica\u00a0gel\u00a060\u00a0F254\u00a0aluminum\u00a0sheets\u00a0and\u00a0visualized\u00a0"

Parasites and Cell Lines\nFor the anti-Leishmania assay, promastigote forms of L. infantum (MHOM/PT/1988/IMT151) and L. tropica (MHOM/PS/2002/63jnF21) were maintained at 24 \u25e6C\u00b1 1 \u25e6C in M199 medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany), 2,5 mg/mL hemin (Sigma), HEPES 1M pH7.4 (Sigma), and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma). The viscerotropic L. infantum strain belongs to IHMT, Portugal cryobank collection, and the dermotropic L. tropica strain was provided by the Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau, Germany (Dr. Katrin Kuhls). Promastigotes in culture had less than 10 in vitro passages, aiming to keep the strain virulence. Promastigotes were used for the experiments at the end of the log phase (days 5\u20136). THP-1 (ATCC\u00ae TIB-202TM) human acute monocytic leukemic cell line was obtained from DSMZ, Germany and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma), and L-glutamine 200 mM (Sigma) at 37 \u25e6C, 5% CO2.\n3.5.2. Leishmania spp. Promastigotes In Vitro Susceptibility\nThe half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined. L. infantum and L. tropica promastigotes were platted in 96-well flat bottom culture plates (VWR) at a density of 5 \u00d7 106 parasites/mL in M199 medium with six different concentrations of each compound (OZ1: 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, and 150 \u00b5M; OZ2, T1, T2 and PIR: 400, 200, 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 \u00b5M), including amphotericin B (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, and 0.313 \u00b5M). A blank (M199 medium alone) and an untreated control (parasites with M199 medium plus 1% DMSO as vehicle solution) were also included. All the compounds were plated out in quadruplicate and incubated for 48-h at 24 \u25e6C \u00b1 1 \u25e6C. The parasite\u2019s viability was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric test. At the end of incubation time, 20 \u00b5L per well of MTT was added (5 mg/mL in PBS), followed by 2\u20134 h incubation at 37 \u25e6C \u00b1 1 \u25e6C. After a centrifugation at 1000\u00d7 g (20 min. 0 \u25e6C), medium was removed, and formazan crystals were solubilized in DMSO; optical density at 595 nm was measured with SynergyTM HTX Multi Mode Microplate Reader (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA). GraphPad Prism V 9.0 was used to calculate IC50 of each chemical by fitting the data as a non-linear regression with variable slope using a dose\u2013response inhibitory model. At least three independent assays were performed. To detect morphological alterations, at the end of the incubation period (48 h), 30 \u00b5L of the parasite\u2019s suspension were collected from different treatment concentrations of each compound to prepare smears on glass slides, fixed with methanol, and stained with 5% (v/v) Giemsa (Sigma). Stained slides were examined with bright field in an inverted microscope (Eclipse 80i Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with 1000\u00d7 amplification, and images were captured with a Nikon DS-Ri1 camera. Image J (version 1.53k) was used to measure promastigote body and flagellum size of at least 30 parasite samples.

After this period, cells were washed with warm PBS, fixed with methanol (Sigma) and stained with Giemsa 5% (Sigma). AmB was used as positive control, and macrophages cultivated in RPMI medium and DMSO (0.5% v/v) were used as negative control. The infection index was determined by multiplying the percentage of infected cells and the number of amastigotes per infected cell as previously described [47].

            "text": "This work describes, for the first time, the synthesis and structure of 1,2,4-trioxolane\u2013 pyrazole and 1,2,4,5-tetraoxane\u2013pyrazole hybrids. Using a convergent synthetic approach, the hybrids were prepared by amide coupling of 3(5)-aminopyrazole with a carboxylic acid derivative of the endoperoxide-containing building block. The compounds were characterized in detail using 1D NMR (1H and 13C{1H}), 2D NMR (1H-1H COSY, HSQC, and HMBC), X-ray crystallography, and HRMS-ESI+. The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopic and X-ray crystallography analyses enabled structural differentiation between 1,2,4-trioxolane and 1,2,4,5-tetraoxane isomers based on chemical shifts, signal sharpness, and number, whereas 1H-1H COSY and HMBC spectra allowed us to elucidate each positional isomer for both classes. X-ray crystallography unambiguously identified the structure of the two isomers and disclosed a distinct supramolecular organisation in the crystalline phase, despite both\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5401 20 of 23\nisomers crystallising in the same monoclinic space-group due to distinct hydrogen bonding patterns linking the molecules. Results reveal that only the endocyclic amine nitrogen of 3(5)-aminopyrazole participates in the amide coupling reactions with the carboxylic acidcontaining endoperoxide building blocks. The reaction affords products from reaction of both 3- and 5-amino pyrazole tautomers, revealing the impact of prototropic tautomerism in the pyrazole heterocycle on reactivity. Preliminary studies were conducted to evaluate the antileishmanial activity of this novel chemotype. Compounds OZ1 and OZ2 displayed better activity against L. tropica than the T1 and T2 compounds, which was attributed to the poor solubility of the tetraoxane hybrids in M199 and RPMI medium. Regarding the assessments performed in L. infantum, the results demonstrated no activity of all compounds toward this strain. The 3-aminopyrazole moiety was tested against both strains to determine the role of this moiety in the antileishmanial activity of all compounds and was found inactive. These results suggest that the antileishmanial activity depends on its substituents and could mean that the incorporation of a pyrazole scaffold into the endoperoxide structure may have no synergistic effect. In the future, and upon optimization, a broad range of Leishmania species and other protozoans, namely other trypanosomatids, should be tested in order to better understand their susceptibility and evaluate the potential of the novel chemotype. The endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids were found to be very stable, as their salt forms could be successfully prepared without compromising the endoperoxide pharmacophore. This conversion to the salt form solved the insoluble nature of these compounds. Tests were conducted to ascertain the potential activity of these endoperoxide\u2013pyrazole hybrids in their salt forms against promastigote and intracellular amastigote forms. Among all the salts tested against promastigotes of L. tropica and L. infantum, OZ1\u2022HCl proved to be the best option. Our findings indicate that the conversion of the free amine in the respective salts not only improved the solubility but also amplified the spectrum of action of this chemotype. The evaluation of L. infantum amastigotes susceptibility corroborates the findings on the antileishmanial activity in promastigotes in which OZ1\u2022HCl was the compound with better activity of the new series. In addition, the compound with the lowest IC50 against L. infantum amastigotes was identified as 2t, suggesting that the structure of these compounds must be simplified in order to enhance the effectiveness of new antileishmanial peroxides. Even though the issue of solubility has been addressed, it is not the primary factor influencing the antiparasitic effectiveness of this series. Considerable structure optimization was achieved with OZ1\u2022HCl and 2t. However, the results of 1,2,4-trioxolane\u2013 pyrazole and 1,2,4,5-tetraoxane\u2013pyrazole hybrids highlight the need for further structure optimization to improve the activity of these compounds.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27175401/s1, S1. 1H, 13C{1H} NMR, COSY, HSQC, HMBC spectra of the synthesized compounds.
