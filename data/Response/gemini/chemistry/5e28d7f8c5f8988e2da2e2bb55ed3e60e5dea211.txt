1. **Investigate the use of machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of glycan identification.** Machine learning algorithms could be trained on a large dataset of glycan MS/MS spectra to learn the patterns that are associated with different glycan structures. This knowledge could then be used to develop a more accurate and efficient glycan identification algorithm.


2. **Develop a software tool that can automatically generate glycan structures from MS/MS spectra.** This tool would be a valuable resource for researchers who are studying the structure of glycans. It could also be used to help identify glycans that are associated with different diseases.


3. **Explore the use of glycan analysis to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for diseases.** Glycans are involved in a wide variety of biological processes, and changes in glycan structure can be associated with different diseases. By understanding the role of glycans in disease, researchers may be able to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic tools that target glycans.


4. **Investigate the use of glycan analysis to study the effects of environmental factors on human health.** Environmental factors, such as pollution and diet, can affect the structure of glycans. By studying the changes in glycan structure that are associated with different environmental factors, researchers may be able to better understand the effects of these factors on human health.


5. **Develop a software tool that can be used to compare the glycan profiles of different samples.** This tool would be a valuable resource for researchers who are studying the differences in glycan structure between different cell types, tissues, or organisms. It could also be used to help identify glycans that are associated with different diseases.
