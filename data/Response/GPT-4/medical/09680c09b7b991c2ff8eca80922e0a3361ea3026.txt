Impact of Humic Products on Maize Tolerance to Abiotic Stresses Beyond Drought: Given the findings related to drought conditions, further research could explore how humic products affect maize's resilience to other abiotic stresses, such as high salinity, extreme temperatures (both heat and cold), and heavy metal contamination. This research could help in understanding the broad-spectrum efficacy of humic products in enhancing stress tolerance in crops.

Mechanistic Studies on Humic Product-Induced Biochemical Pathways: The study suggests complex interactions between humic products, plant biochemistry, and environmental factors. Future research could focus on dissecting these interactions at the molecular level, particularly how humic products influence plant hormonal signaling, gene expression related to stress response, and specific biochemical pathways responsible for increased lignification and carbohydrate production.

Evaluation of Humic Products on Crop Yield and Quality Under Varied Climatic Conditions: Conducting multi-location trials across different climatic zones could help in evaluating the consistency of humic product benefits on maize yield and quality traits. Such studies could also identify the optimal conditions under which humic products maximize their beneficial effects on crops.

Long-term Effects of Humic Products on Soil Health and Plant Microbiome: Investigating the long-term application effects of humic products on soil health parameters, including soil organic matter content, microbial diversity, and activity. Additionally, understanding how these products affect the plant microbiome could provide insights into indirect mechanisms through which humic products influence plant growth and stress resilience.

Comparative Analysis of Different Humic Product Formulations on Maize Growth: The study utilized a specific humic product; future research could compare the efficacy of various humic product formulations, including differences in source material, extraction methods, and application rates. This research could help in optimizing humic product formulations for specific crop needs and environmental conditions.
