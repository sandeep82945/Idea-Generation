Optimization and Efficiency Improvement: Developing new algorithms or optimizing existing ones to reduce the computational resources and time required for style transfer, especially in real-time applications such as AR/VR. This could involve exploring more efficient neural network architectures, compression techniques, or leveraging hardware acceleration.

Enhanced Depth Estimation Techniques: Investigating more advanced depth estimation techniques to improve the accuracy of depth maps used in the style transfer process. This could include the use of machine learning models that are better at handling complex scenes or the integration of LiDAR data in devices that support it, to enhance the 3D structure understanding of the input images.

Expanding to Video and Live Feed Applications: Extending the proposed method to video sequences and live feeds, enabling style transfer in dynamic scenes. This would involve tackling challenges such as temporal coherence, real-time processing demands, and effectively managing depth information over time to ensure consistent stylization across frames.

Multi-modal and Interactive Style Transfer: Exploring multi-modal inputs (such as combining visual, depth, and audio data) for style transfer to create more immersive and interactive experiences. Additionally, developing interfaces that allow users to intuitively control and manipulate the depth aspects of the style transfer process, offering a new layer of creative expression.

Cross-Disciplinary Applications and Evaluation: Applying the proposed method in cross-disciplinary fields such as medical imaging, where enhanced realism can aid in better visualization of anatomical structures, or in robotics, for improving machine perception and interaction with the environment. Additionally, establishing comprehensive evaluation frameworks that include user studies to assess the perceptual quality and realism of stylized images and their applicability in various domains.
