The portion of the text mentioning future research direction is:

"Although the ARIMA model results are robust and suitable for future economic forecasting, caution should be exercised in generalizing the study results due to the linear interpolations and annual data disaggregation conducted to expand the study sample and remedy missing observation limitations. Furthermore, the scope of the study results is limited to GDP growth-forecasting and may not be used to extrapolate for wider development aspects that are currently critical for Somalia, such as poverty reduction and youth employment."
