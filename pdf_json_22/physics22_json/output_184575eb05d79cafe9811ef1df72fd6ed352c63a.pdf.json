IMBHs originally located at the centre of dwarfs that later collide with the Milky Way (MW) could be wandering, undetected, in our Galaxy. We used TNG50, the highest resolution run of the IllustrisTNG project, to study the kinematics and dynamics of star clusters, in the appropriate mass range, acting as IMBH proxies in an MW analogue galaxy. We showed that \u223c 87 per cent of our studied IMBHs drift inward. The radial velocity of these sinking IMBHs has a median magnitude of \u223c 0 . 44 ckpc h \u22121 Gyr \u22121 and no dependence on the black hole mass. The central 1 ckpc h \u22121 has the highest number density of IMBHs in the g alaxy. A ph ysical toy model with linear drag forces was developed to explain the orbital circularization with time. These findings constrain the spatial distribution of IMBHs, suggesting that future searches should focus on the central regions of the Galaxy .

Stretching from \u223c 3 M Thompson et al. 2019 ) to \u223c 5 \u00d7 10 10 M (Dullo, Gil de Paz & napen 2021 ), they have been identified as close as \u223c 1000 pc (Oke 977 ) and as far as z = 7.642 (Wang et al. 2021 ). Two populations of black holes have been broadly investigated nd located in specific environments. Stellar-mass black holes, with ypical mass 10 3 M , are ubiquitous in the volume of galaxies. ccording to recent estimates (e.g. Elbert, Bullock & Kaplinghat 018 ), the Milky Way (MW) may host \u223c10 8 such black holes n its volume. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with masses 10 6 M , are typically found at the centre of massive galaxies. The W hosts an SMBH of \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 6 M (e.g. Ghez et al. 2008 ; Genzel,\nisenhauer & Gillessen 2010 ), and the near-horizon features of the entral object in M87 were recently imaged by the EHT collaboration n a landmark result (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration 2019 ).\nProfound correlations exist between the mass of the central black ole and some properties of the host galaxy, such as its stellar mass nd velocity dispersion (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000 ; Gebhardt et al. 000 ), suggesting a co-evolution between the massive central object nd the host (Kormendy & Ho 2013 ). Extending these correlations to maller black hole masses, it is reasonable to expect that black holes\nE-mail: emma weller@colle ge.harvard.edu (EJW); abio.pacucci@cf a.harvard.edu (FP)\nw a G a\n2022 The Author(s) ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\nn an intermediate-mass range (10 3 M M \u2022 10 6 M ), known s intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), should be contained in warf galaxies (see e.g. the recent re vie w by Greene, Strader & Ho 020 ). It is unclear whether these correlations hold down to very ow masses, or break down instead (see e.g. Baldassare et al. 2017 ; acucci et al. 2018 ; Nguyen et al. 2019 ; Baldassare et al. 2020 or different perspectives on the topic). However, clear detections f IMBHs as light as 5 \u00d7 10 4 M are reported in dwarf galaxies Baldassare et al. 2015 ), and a sizable fraction of their nuclei are redicted to be activ e (P acucci, Mezcua & Re gan 2021 ), i.e. hosting ccreting black holes.\nThe MW Galaxy has experienced numerous mergers during ts cosmic history, which have possibly inserted IMBHs within ts volume. Recent studies suggest that the MW has experienced 5 \u00b1 3 mergers with galaxies with stellar masses 4 . 5 \u00d7 10 6 M Kruijssen et al. 2020 ). These captured IMBHs could still be andering inside the MW, with lo w-le vel accretion that makes them ery challenging to detect. The investigation of these wandering nd undetected IMBHs is fairly recent (see e.g. Bellovary et al. 010 ; Gonz \u0301alez & Guzm \u0301an 2018 ; Greene et al. 2021 ; Ricarte et al. 021a , b ). In particular, Ricarte et al. ( 2021b ) suggest that thousands f wandering black holes, also of supermassive size, might be found nside galaxy cluster haloes.\nIn order to guide future observational efforts to detect IMBHs andering in the MW, it is instrumental to understand their dynamics\nnd kinematics. Where are IMBHs most likely located in the MW alaxy, and what is their typical velocity? Furthermore, which forces ct on them, and what is their typical sinking time?

It is important to remark that in this paper we focus only on IMBHs ormed in dwarf galaxies and captured by the MW. Of course, other ormation processes for IMBHs have been proposed, including: (i) unaway mergers in globular star clusters (e.g. Portegies Zwart &\ncMillan 2002 ; G \u0308urkan, Freitag & Rasio 2004 ; Gonz \u0301alez et al. 021 ; Shi, Grudi \u0301c & Hopkins 2021 ), (ii) hyper-Eddington accretion n to stellar-mass black holes (e.g. Ryu et al. 2016 ), (iii) direct ollapse of hypermassive quasi-stars (e.g. Volonteri & Begelman 010 ; Schleicher et al. 2013 ), and (iv) supra-exponential accretion on eed black holes (e.g. Alexander & Natarajan 2014 ; Natarajan 2021 ). ach of these channels would produce a different number density of MBHs, as well as different spatial distributions, with likely very ifferent dynamical properties. For example, IMBHs formed in-situ ould probably have a lower typical velocity with respect to the local as and stars. It is thus important to keep in mind that in this study e are focusing only on a specific formation channel for IMBHs. We use the Planck Collaboration VI ( 2020 ) cosmology as a eference. In the following Section 2 we describe the simulation suite sed, as well as our method to select IMBH proxies. In Section 3 we escribe the location of IMBHs in the MW and the radial evolution of heir orbits, while in Section 4 we study their kinematics, regarding D and radial velocities, and dynamics. Finally, in Section 5 we iscuss the conclusions of our work.\nSIMULATION\nn this section, we present the simulation suite and the methodology sed to select IMBH proxies, as well as the MW analogue galaxy.\n.1 TNG50\nllustrisTNG (Marinacci et al. 2018 ; Naiman et al. 2018 ; Nelson et al. 018 ; Pillepich et al. 2018a , b ; Springel et al. 2018 ; Nelson et al. 019a ) is a suite of cosmological simulations performed with the oving-mesh code AREPO (Springel 2010 ). Each simulation solves he evolutionary equations for dark matter, gas, stars, and SMBHs n a self-consistent fashion, from z = 127 to z = 0 (Nelson et al. 019a ). For the purpose of this study, we used TNG50-1 (Nelson t al. 2019b ; Pillepich et al. 2019 ), which is the simulation with the ighest resolution. TNG50-1 has 2 \u00d7 2160 3 resolution elements, a olume of 35 3 cMpc 3 h \u22123 (or \u223c 50 3 cMpc 3 , hence the name), and mean time of \u223c 0 . 138 Gyr between snapshots. TNG50-1 also has hree sub-boxes, defined as volumes of the simulation with data saved t a higher time cadence (Nelson et al. 2019b ).\nAt z = 0, the collision-less components (including star objects, hich we use as IMBH proxies \u2013 see Section 2.2) have a gravitational\noftening length of 288 pc (Nelson et al. 2019b ). This is smaller than he scales on which we study black hole dynamics ( 1 kpc ), so the ele v ant gravitational interactions are not affected.\nIn TNG50 the baryon and dark matter particle masses are . 5 \u00d7 10 4 M and 4 . 5 \u00d7 10 5 M , respectively. Since our IMBH roxies have a mass range of \u223c (2 . 6 \u2212 9 . 9) \u00d7 10 4 M , this might uggest that the dynamical friction is possibly underestimated in ertain situations, which then leads to a slight o v erestimation in the urviving IMBH population. None the less, the sinking time-scales hat we find are \u223c 10 Gyr , which is of the order that is expected for hese objects under the influence of dynamical friction (Binney &\nremaine 1987 ). f\nNRAS 511, 2229\u20132238 (2022)\n.2 Identifying captured IMBH proxies\nhe black hole objects in the simulation mostly fall in the supermasive range \u2013 the least massive black hole object in TNG50-1 at z = is \u223c 1 . 2 \u00d7 10 6 M , which is larger than the mass range we aim to tudy. Instead, we used star (cluster) objects between 10 4 and 10 6 M s IMBH proxies. This is acceptable because we are only interested n gravitational effects on large scales. We used two methods to elect IMBHs captured by the MW, which we describe in turn.\nIn the first, we used a list of z = 0 MW and M31 analogue alaxies in the simulation (Engler et al. 2021 ; Pillepich et al. 2021 ). e identified a total of four MW analogues whose centres of mass fall ithin one of the three TNG50-1 sub-boxes at snapshot 99 ( z \u2248 0). e then searched the merger trees of these MW analogues for dwarf alaxies, defined as subhaloes in the mass range 10 6 \u2212 10 10 M . e limited the search to more recent mergers, considering only warfs that appear after snapshot 60 ( \u223c 7 . 4 Gyr) in the merger tree. e selected IMBH proxies from these dwarfs that end up in the orresponding MW analogue (and within the sub-box) by z = 0. e focused on IMBHs centrally located in their host dwarfs, so e required the IMBHs to be less than 0 . 01 ckpc from the dwarf entre-of-mass (at the snapshot in which the dwarf appears in the W analogue merger tree). A total of four IMBHs, with masses n the range \u223c (3 . 4 \u2212 8 . 5) \u00d7 10 4 M , met all the abo v ementioned onditions. We call this group Set 1. Extending the distance limit from he dwarf centre-of-mass to 0 . 05 ckpc, we obtained 385 captured MBH proxies, with masses between \u223c (3 . 0 \u2212 9 . 1) \u00d7 10 4 M . We all this group Set 2, and we use it to have a richer statistical opulation. All of the IMBH proxies in Sets 1 and 2 turned out to ome from the same dwarf galaxy (Subhalo ID 456591 at snapshot 1, or \u223c 9 . 2 Gyr) and end up in the same MW analogue (Subhalo D 565089 at snapshot 99). This MW analogue falls within sub-box , which contains 0 . 3 per cent of the full simulation volume and has mean time of \u223c 0 . 004 Gyr between snapshots. We did not find a atisfactory explanation for why all of the suitable IMBHs came from he same dwarf, although it is important to note we only considered warfs that merged recently with just four MW analogues, so our ollection was small to begin with.\nTo obtain a larger and more varied set of IMBHs for a larger tatistical sample, we developed a second selection method. Rather han use the sub-boxes, we returned to the main simulation, but ept the same MW analogue (Subhalo 565089) for consistency. We ested every 20th IMBH proxy in the galaxy at snapshot 99 ( z \u2248 0) nd selected each one that, at the first snapshot after its birth, was ot in the main progenitor of the MW analogue. This resulted in 148 captured IMBH proxies, with masses between \u223c (2 . 6 \u2212 9 . 9) \u00d7 0 4 M , which we call Set 3. We find that the IMBHs in this set enter he MW o v er a period of 88 snapshots ( \u223c 13 . 0 Gyr).\nIt is important to note that the mass range co v ered by our three sets s only \u223c 7 . 4 per cent of the mass range we canonically assigned to MBHs (10 4 to 10 6 M ). This makes sense, as the largest star cluster bject in the MW analogue 565089 at z = 0 is just 1 . 4 \u00d7 10 5 M . his limited mass range is not ideal, but we believe it is better than sing the black hole objects, which are far too large. A summary of the characteristics of the three sets is given in able 1 . T wo additional sets, both subsets of Set 3, are also included n the table, and described in Section 3.2.\nEach star cluster acting as an IMBH proxy is tracked by its particle D, which remains constant throughout the simulation. Single stars ithin a cluster cannot be tracked, because they do not possess ndividual identifiers in the Illustris TNG50 simulation. In order o track the position of IMBH proxies throughout the simulation, or each snapshot of interest an array of particle IDs of star cluster\no c g p\n2\nA l a t S f f c m s\n\u2018 c u \u2018\n3 I\nI w\n3\nF r t o h d\nc t r d s F r\nd c i w t o\nFigure 1. 3D orbits of IMBHs in Set 1 for illustration purposes.

The properties of a iven IMBH proxy were then found by locating the star cluster\u2019s article ID against the full list of particle IDs. .3 MW analogue galaxy s explained in Section 2.2, although there are many MW and M31ike galaxies in TNG50, only four lie in the sub-boxes, and our nalysis uses just one of them \u2013 namely Subhalo 565089. This was he only galaxy containing IMBHs that met the strict constraints for ets 1 and 2. Thus, when we needed to loosen our selection criteria or Set 3 to obtain a larger number of IMBHs, focusing on IMBHs rom Subhalo 565089 seemed like a natural choice. This also adds onsistency across Sets 1\u20133, making results from the different sets ore comparable. This is quite valuable, as we switch between the ets frequently throughout our study. In the following sections, we will refer to Subhalo 565089 as the MW analogue\u2019 or simply \u2018the MW\u2019. Additionally, the subhalo entre-of-mass property is not available in the sub-boxes, hence we se the subhalo position for all relative motion calculations. Thus, MW centre\u2019 refers to the position of Subhalo 565089. L O C AT I O N A N D R A D I A L E VO L U T I O N O F NTERMEDIATE-MASS BLACK H O L E S n this section, we describe the location of IMBHs in the MW, as ell as their tendency to sink towards the centre of the galaxy. .1 Time evolution of radial distance or each IMBH in Set 1, we calculated the x , y , and z coordinates elative to the MW centre at every sub-box snapshot from present ime back to the time when the IMBH first entered the sub-box. These rbits are shown, for illustration purposes, in Fig. 1 . These IMBHs ave masses in the range (3 . 4 \u2212 8 . 5) \u00d7 10 4 M and various orbital istances from the MW centre. We then used these data to calculate the distance from the MW\nentre at each snapshot for each IMBH in Set 1. Binning the distances o reveal overall trends, we obtained the results shown in Fig. 2 . We epeated the same process for Set 2, but rather than binning the istances, we only calculated the distance at every 20th sub-box napshot, for computational simplicity. The results are shown in ig. 3 , where the central solid line is the median, while the shaded ange indicates dispersion via the interquartile range.\nFigs 2 and 3 indicate that the radial distances of IMBHs tend to ecrease with increasing time. This fits with our expectation that aptured IMBHs sink towards the galactic centre, an effect that s explained by mass migration due to dynamical friction. Earlier orks have already suggested that black holes, which are among he heaviest objects in galaxies, tend to cluster in the galactic centre v er time.

To further study their long-term ehaviour, we calculated the secular radial velocity of a subset of the MBHs in Set 3, i.e. our most e xtensiv e collection. In particular, we ound the distance from the MW centre for each IMBH at snapshots 1\u201384 ( \u223c 10 . 8 \u2212 11 . 3 Gyr) and 96\u201399 ( \u223c 13 . 3 \u2212 13 . 8 Gyr) of the ain simulation. We chose this \u223c 3 . 0 Gyr time period as a balance etween a v oiding small-scale variations while also refraining from ssuming constant velocity on large time-scales.\nWe then calculated the best linear fit to this radial distance versus ime data for each IMBH. The slope gives the long-term radial elocity of the IMBH relative to the MW centre, and the value of the ine at \u223c 13 . 8 Gyr gives the distance from the MW centre at z = 0.\nTo a v oid any dynamic instability from IMBHs that just merged ith the MW, we excluded any IMBHs that are not present in the MW or at least two snapshots prior to the studied time period (snapshots 9 and 80). We also excluded any IMBHs that are within 1 ckpc h \u22121 f the MW centre in snapshots 81\u201384, as well as any IMBHs whose stimated radial velocity changes by 1 ckpc h \u22121 Gyr \u22121 or more when alculated using snapshots 81\u201384 and 88\u201391 (rather than 81\u201384 and 6\u201399). This helps ensure that we are not considering IMBHs that each the central region of the MW before or near the beginning f the studied time period. These IMBHs would likely stay near he centre for the entire time period, causing the radial velocity to e underestimated. Note that a few other IMBHs were excluded ecause, while they were present in the MW in snapshots 79 and 80, nd still in the MW at snapshot 99, they were not classified as part f the MW in one or more of the other studied snapshots. There are 53 IMBHs that meet all of these requirements. We call this group et 4 (see Table 1 ). Fig. 4 shows a histogram of radial velocities. The vertical values re normalized such that their integral is unity (from now on we will efer to this simply as a normalized histogram). We found that 825 MBHs ( \u223c 86 . 6 per cent of Set 4) hav e ne gativ e radial velocity, with 40 ( \u223c 67 . 2 per cent ) between \u22121 and 0 ckpc h \u22121 Gyr \u22121 . We call the roup of 825 sinking IMBHs Set 5 (see Table 1 ). The median radial elocity of this set is \u223c \u22120 . 44 ckpc h \u22121 Gyr \u22121 . These results suggest hat most captured IMBHs in the MW sink towards the galactic entre.\nFig. 5 shows a normalized histogram of radial distances at z = 0. e found that 41 IMBHs ( \u223c 4 . 3 per cent of Set 4) reach the central olume of the MW, defined as the innermost sphere with a radius f 1 ckpc h \u22121 . Recall that none of the IMBHs in Set 4 were in this egion just \u223c 2 . 5 Gyr earlier, at snapshot 84.\nThe resulting IMBH number density within the central 1 ckpc h \u22121 s \u223c1.6 times the value found within the central 2 ckpc h \u22121 . As hown in the histogram, distance ranges past 2 ckpc h \u22121 contain uch smaller numbers of IMBHs. Thus, our simulations suggest hat the central \u223c 1 ckpc h \u22121 of the Galaxy holds the highest density f IMBHs. To conclude, it is worth noting that, as our IMBHs in Sets 1 and\nare chosen to be strongly bound to the host dwarf galaxy, none of hem are ejected during the merging process with the MW analogue. nterestingly, we computed that \u223c 7 . 5 per cent of the IMBHs in Set have a positive total energy with respect to the MW in snapshot 2 (the first snapshot after the merging event). None the less, these MBH proxies are still counted as part of the MW until the very end\no g\n4 T\nI p t\n4\nT e F a c t t h c s\nt o a o h i g i p\nFigure 6.

We then sorted the velocity magnitudes into groups by heir corresponding radial distances and found a Gaussian fit for he velocity distribution of each group. Fig. 6 shows normalized istograms (with 16 bins each) and Gaussian fits for groups with orresponding radial distances up to 30 ckpc h \u22121 . Table 2 gives the tatistical descriptors of these Gaussian fits.\nNe xt, for ev ery IMBH, we calculated the v elocity v ector relativ e o each of the four closest gas particles. We then calculated the mean f the magnitudes of the four velocity vectors for each IMBH and, s before, sorted the mean velocity magnitudes into groups based n radial distance from the MW centre. Fig. 7 shows normalized istograms (with 16 bins) for each group up to 30 ckpc h \u22121 . Also ncluded are skewed normal fits for the velocity distribution of each roup. Table 2 gives the statistical descriptors of these skewed fits. In mplementing the skewed normal distribution, we used the definition rovided by Azzalini & Capitanio ( 2009 ).\nWe recognize that the histograms in Fig. 6 are not necessarily aussian, but we use this distribution as the simplest one to btain some statistical information on the mean and variance of he histograms. With a Gaussian fit we intend to provide a simple escription of the data, not to infer any physical interpretation on ts origin. The Gaussian fits in Fig. 6 are also used to highlight the trong contrast with the distributions of v elocities relativ e to the local as (Fig. 7 ), which are, instead, strongly non-Gaussian (except the adial bin 0 \u2212 5 ckpc h \u22121 ) and fitted with a skewed function.\nFig. 6 shows that typical velocities of IMBHs with respect to he centre of the MW are \u223c 180 km s \u22121 , with larger variance as the adial distance decreases. In particular, we note that the variance is factor \u223c2 larger in the innermost radial bin than in the outermost in. This may be due to a larger number of IMBHs in the inner bins, ut a higher stellar velocity variance with decreasing galactocentric istance is also observed and predicted by models (Battaglia et al. 005 ; Dehnen, McLaughlin & Sachania 2006 ; Brown et al. 2010 ). Fig. 7 shows that velocity magnitudes relative to the local gas re significantly lower, typically \u223c 88 km s \u22121 (for radial distances 5 ckpc h \u22121 ), and the distribution is highly skewed towards high alues. The distribution of IMBH velocities with respect to the ocal gas was obtained because it is rele v ant for the calculation of ccretion rates on to wandering IMBHs in the MW. In fact, classical ondi accretion calculations (Bondi 1952 ) rely on the velocity of the andering object with respect to the local gas frame. More details n this issue are discussed in Section 5. To explain the high velocity of the 0 \u2212 5 ckpc h \u22121 range in Fig. 7 ,\ne found the radial distance and velocity magnitude relative to he MW centre for each gas particle in the MW. We then sorted he velocity versus distance data into 1 ckpc h \u22121 bins and found he median velocity of each group. The results, shown in Fig. 8 , uggest that the gas velocity in the central 5 ckpc h \u22121 of the MW is ignificantly high, and explained by the presence of a \u223c 9 \u00d7 10 7 M MBH at the centre of the MW analogue. Fig. 8 also shows the rbital velocity around a typical \u223c 10 8 M SMBH at radial distances\nMNRAS 511, 2229\u20132238 (2022)\nTable 2.

For each IMBH in et 5, we found the value of the best-fitting line from Section 3.2 at\n12 . 3 Gyr (the mean of the eight times at which radial distance was easured). This gave us an estimate for the distance from the MW\nentre. We then considered sinking (radial) v elocity v ersus radial istance for the 808 sinking IMBHs with radial distances less than 0 ckpc h \u22121 . Fig. 9 shows a scatter plot of the data, as well as the ean sinking velocity over 1 ckpc h \u22121 bins (darker blue line). We ound the binned data to be well-fitted by an empirical curve of the orm:\n= k R p , (1) here V and R are the sinking velocity in ckpc h \u22121 Gyr \u22121 and radial istance in ckpc h \u22121 , respectively, both functions of the simulation\nFigure 10. Median k value versus group number. Here, k is the constant of proportionality in the empirically derived relation V = kR p between sinking velocity and radial distance. IMBHs in Set 5 with radial distances less than 30 ckpc h \u22121 are divided by mass into 45 groups, where the group number increases with increasing mass. The best-fitting line to this data is shown, and the very small slope indicates that sinking velocity does not depend on black hole mass.\nt r\na o ( 2 i\nR\nW m g i 1 w T b t e c i c s\nt t B a\ne w\nc d i m M w 0 v\nR\nw\ni r\na H I r m m I b T g\ne m v t d t t M c l 7 h o\nt a S s c m t r d d t o\nd\ni t v\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/511/2/2229/6516985 by U niversity of D urham user on 23 M ay 2022\nime t in Gyr. We found k \u2248 \u22120 . 10846 Gyr \u22121 and p \u2248 0.83472. The esults of the regression are added to Fig. 9 as a red line. The fact that the magnitude of the radial velocity V ( t ) declines s an IMBH approaches the centre matches our expectation that the rbits of the IMBHs circularize as they sink farther into the MW for a semi-analytical treatment of this effect, see e.g. Bonetti et al. 020 ). Solving the ordinary differential equation in equation (1), with ntegration constant R ( t = 0) = R 0 , we find: ( t) = [ R (1 \u2212p) 0 + k t(1 \u2212 p) ] 1 1 \u2212p . (2) e divided this IMBH data set into 45 mass bins and calculated the edian value of k = V / R p (where we keep p \u2248 0.83472) for each\nroup. We plotted the median k values versus group number, as shown n Fig. 10 , and obtained a best-fitting line with a slope of \u223c 1 . 4951 \u00d7 0 \u22124 Gyr \u22121 , indicating virtually no dependence on mass. In other ords, the sinking velocity does not depend on the mass of the IMBH. his result is interesting because one would naiv ely e xpect heavier lack holes to sink faster. In reality, IMBHs sink inefficiently towards he centre, especially when wandering inside clumpier galaxies. For xample, Ma et al. ( 2021 ) have recently suggested that in high- z lumpy galaxies, black holes less massive than 10 8 M (a limit that ncludes our entire mass range) migrate inef ficiently to wards the entre, with velocity magnitudes changing erratically and a much lower deceleration.\nThe empirical model in equation (1) is useful to determine general rends in the data, but it does not provide any information regarding he forces acting to reduce the radial velocity as the IMBH sinks. elo w, we de velop a toy model to study the circularization effect nd gain useful insights into the processes that lead to it.\nWe assume for simplicity a linear drag force of the form \u2212bV (see .g. Chandrasekhar 1943 ) and a gravitational force GM \u2022M ( R )/ R 2 , here M \u2022 is the mass of the IMBH, M ( R ) is the mass of the MW\nontained within the radius R , and b is the drag force constant, with imensions equal to a mass o v er a time. Note that a linear drag force s appropriate when the IMBH is moving through a non-turbulent edium at relatively low (radial) speed. In addition, we assume an W with a constant mass density \u03c1. We let t = 0 mark the time at hich the IMBH entered the MW, and assume for simplicity V ( t = ) = 0. We also let R ( t = 0) = R 0 , and find a solution of the initial alue problem of the form:\n( t) = R 0 2\n[ (1 + ) e \u2212 b 2 M (1 \u2212 ) t \u2212 (1 \u2212 ) e \u2212 b 2 M (1 + ) t ] , (3)\nhere:\n= \u221a 1 \u2212 16 \u03c0G\u03c1M 2\n3 b 2 (4)\ns a dimension-less parameter that controls the rate at which the adius decreases.\nNext, we found best-fitting curves of the forms in equations (2) nd (3) for the radial distance versus time data of each IMBH in Set 1. ere, t represents the time since the dwarf galaxy hosting these four MBHs merged with the MW (at snapshot 71, or \u223c 9 . 2 Gyr). The esults are shown in Fig. 11 , with the fit parameters for the physical odel listed in Table 3 . Visually, both the empirical and physical odels are successful in reproducing the decreasing distance of the MBHs with increasing time. We also show in Fig. 12 the residuals etween the physical and empirical models and the simulation data. hese small differences support the conclusion that our models are ood fits for the data. We note that the values of the parameters b /2 M are consistent with ach other, and the parameter of linear drag, b , is proportional to the ass of the perturber, M (Binney & Tremaine 1987 ). Interestingly, the alues of the initial distances, R 0 are similar to each other, except for he heaviest IMBH which is approximately the double. Similar initial istances are expected, because all the IMBHs are originating from he same dwarf galaxy, which merges with the MW. We investigated his issue further, and found that the dwarf galaxy merged with the\nW at snapshot 71, at which point the heaviest IMBH becomes lassified as a particle belonging to the MW. Ho we ver, the three ighter IMBHs become part of the MW only at the following snapshot 2. We hypothesize that some complex encounter dynamics may ave influenced the association of the heaviest IMBH earlier than the thers, so that its initial radius is also larger. The physical model described by equation (3) allowed us to quanify some rele v ant physical parameters. First, we used equation (4) nd Table 3 to calculate \u03c1 from the fit parameters for each IMBH in et 1. We found a mean density of \u223c 2 . 21 \u00d7 10 \u22124 M pc \u22123 , with a tandard deviation of \u223c 2 . 23 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M pc \u22123 . For comparison, we alculated the average density of the MW analogue within the halfass radius, in each snapshot from 71 to 99. The mean density o v er hese snapshots was 5 . 05 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M pc \u22123 . Note that the half-mass adius of the MW is \u223c 38 . 4 ckpc h \u22121 , much larger than the radial istances of the IMBHs in Set 4, so it makes sense that the average ensity calculated using this half-mass radius would be lower than he estimate from our physical model. Therefore we conclude that ur model provides a reasonable density estimate. We also estimated the time needed for an IMBH to reach a radial istance of 1 ckpc h \u22121 , using equation (3) and the mean values of R 0 , , and b /2 M from Table 3 , finding a sinking time-scale of \u223c 8 . 3 Gyr. We note that in our analysis we focused on IMBHs with v < 0, .e. on sinking particles. Of course, as the drag force would work o oppose the velocity independently of the direction of the velocity ector, our model would apply also for particles with v > 0.

In Fig. 9 we limit our nalysis to sinking IMBHs because: (i) we are mostly interested in articles that, in the long term, are approaching the centre, because f the implications for the possibility of observing them, and (ii) they epresent the majority of IMBHs studied.\nThe study of the effect of dynamical friction in the sinking (or ot) of central black holes in merging galaxies is, of course, not new. arly works (e.g. Go v ernato, Colpi & Maraschi 1994 ; Mayer et al. 007 ) already showed the importance of dynamical friction from gas hich leads central SMBHs in merging galaxies to approach each ther, o v er sinking time-scales of several Gyrs. More recent works ave stressed the challenges in approaching distances shorter than 100 pc in minor mergers (see e.g. Dosopoulou & Antonini 2017 ), he dependence on the mass ratio of the merging galaxies (see e.g. remmel et al. 2018 ), and the importance of the stellar component in he dynamical process, which can be dominant for IMBHs especially t high- z (see e.g. Pfister et al. 2019 ).\nDI SCUSSI ON A N D C O N C L U S I O N S\nn this study, we used the TNG50 cosmological simulation from he IllustrisTNG project to study the kinematics and dynamics of utative IMBHs wandering in the MW, as a result of their capture uring mergers with dwarf galaxies.

By locating the olume of the Galaxy containing the highest density of IMBHs, we rovide guidance for observ ational ef forts to detect these objects. everal studies have started to investigate the putative population of assive and supermassive wandering black holes in galaxies (see e.g. ellovary et al. 2010 ; Ricarte et al. 2021a , b ). In particular, Bellovary t al. ( 2010 ) predict that the MW should host 5\u201315 IMBHs within its alo, while more recent studies (Ricarte et al. 2021a ) provide higher stimates.\nOur results concerning velocity distributions relative to the galactic entre and surrounding gas allow calculations of Bondi (Bondi 1952 ) r Bondi-like accretion rates for IMBHs. Due to the low-density, nonentral environments that should host these IMBHs, the appropriate ode to describe their accretion is an advection-dominated accretion ow, or ADAF (Narayan & Yi 1994 , 1995 ; Abramowicz et al. 1995 ; arayan & McClintock 2008 ; Yuan & Narayan 2014 ), possibly odified to take into account the effects of convection and outflows Igumenshchev, Narayan & Abramowicz 2003 ; Proga & Begelman 003 ). Note that already Bellovary et al. ( 2010 ) predicted that ff-nuclear black holes could be detected as ultraluminous X-ray ources.\nFinally, the spatial and velocity distributions of these objects an inform predictions of gravitational wav e ev ents generated by erging IMBHs in the MW. It is possible that the current and future ra vitational wa ve detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the aser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA; Amaro-Seoane et al. 017 ) could detect these merging events in the MW or nearby major alaxies (see e.g. Pacucci & Loeb 2020 ). For example, Fragione, insburg & Kocsis ( 2018 ) predict that up to \u223c1000 IMBHs, with asses in the range 10 3 \u2212 10 4 M in their model, could be wandering ithin \u223c 1 kpc of the Galactic centre, generating signals detectable n the gravitational waves domain. Of course, our findings come with several caveats. While we tudy o v er 2000 IMBHs, sev eral hundred of which came from the ame dwarf galaxy, we are not suggesting that the MW, or dwarfs erging with the MW, contain this many actual IMBHs. Rather, ur study provides a statistical sampling of the location and velocity istribution of IMBHs in the MW, without offering any insights on heir actual number.\nAs explained in Section 2.2, the IMBHs used are proxies, i.e. tellar objects in the correct mass range. Their gravitational effect n the environment should be the same, as noted also by, e.g. istani et al. ( 2016 ), where the authors used the same technique or globular clusters instead of IMBHs. Nevertheless, this is a point orth remembering when considering our results. One effect of sing star clusters as proxies, also discussed in Section 2.2, is that he y only co v er a fraction of the typical mass range of IMBHs. dditionally, cluster objects are subject to some mass-loss through v aporation. In our simulations, IMBH proxies have a median massoss of \u223c 3 . 6 per cent o v er the time frame investigated (snapshots 1\u201399), which is too small to affect our conclusions. Finally, we note hat our kinematic and dynamical analyses are constrained by a time esolution of \u223c 0 . 14 Gyr in the main simulation, and \u223c 0 . 004 Gyr in ub-box 2.\nIn summary, this study is an important first step in investigating the roperties of captured IMBHs in the MW. Despite large unknowns in heir properties and regarding their very existence in the MW, efforts\no detect them are underway, and are crucial to understand the last nknown black hole population in our Galaxy.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the anonymous referee for constructive comments on he manuscript.
