1. **Investigate the effect of different polysaccharides on the properties of composite aerogels.** The paper only investigates the use of Konjac glucomannan (KGM) as the polysaccharide component of the composite aerogels. However, there are many other polysaccharides that could be used, each with its own unique properties. It would be interesting to see how the properties of the composite aerogels change when different polysaccharides are used.
2. **Explore the use of different silica precursors for the preparation of composite aerogels.** The paper only investigates the use of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as the silica precursor for the preparation of the composite aerogels. However, there are many other silica precursors that could be used, each with its own unique properties. It would be interesting to see how the properties of the composite aerogels change when different silica precursors are used.
3. **Investigate the effect of different preparation methods on the properties of composite aerogels.** The paper only investigates the use of two different preparation methods for the composite aerogels: physical blending and co-precursor. However, there are many other preparation methods that could be used, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages. It would be interesting to see how the properties of the composite aerogels change when different preparation methods are used.
4. **Explore the use of composite aerogels for different applications.** The paper only briefly discusses the potential applications of the composite aerogels. However, there are many different applications for which composite aerogels could be used. It would be interesting to explore these applications in more detail.
5. **Investigate the long-term stability of composite aerogels.** The paper does not discuss the long-term stability of the composite aerogels. However, it is important to know how the properties of the composite aerogels change over time. This information would be useful for determining the potential applications of the composite aerogels.
