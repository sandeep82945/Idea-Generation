    "abstractText": "Equilibrium solution concepts of normal-form games, such as Nash equilibria, correlated equilibria, and coarse correlated equilibria, describe the joint strategy profiles from which no player has incentive to unilaterally deviate. They are widely studied in game theory, economics, and multiagent systems. Equilibrium concepts are invariant under certain transforms of the payoffs. We define an equilibriuminspired distance metric for the space of all normal-form games and uncover a distance-preserving equilibrium-invariant embedding. Furthermore, we propose an additional transform which defines a better-response-invariant distance metric and embedding. To demonstrate these metric spaces we study 2\u00d72 games. The equilibrium-invariant embedding of 2\u00d72 games has an efficient two variable parameterization (a reduction from eight), where each variable geometrically describes an angle on a unit circle. Interesting properties can be spatially inferred from the embedding, including: equilibrium support, cycles, competition, coordination, distances, best-responses, and symmetries. The best-response-invariant embedding of 2\u00d72 games, after considering symmetries, rediscovers a set of 15 games, and their respective equivalence classes. We propose that this set of game classes is fundamental and captures all possible interesting strategic interactions in 2\u00d72 games. We introduce a directed graph representation and name for each class. Finally, we leverage the tools developed for 2\u00d72 games to develop game theoretic visualizations of large normal-form and extensive-form games that aim to fingerprint the strategic interactions that occur within.",

In some classes of games, such as two-player zero-sum games, the Nash equilibrium solution concept is considered fundamental (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1947), because it is unexploitable and interchangeable in this class. CEs and CCEs are important in n-player general-sum games, which may require coordination facilitated by a correlation device. The set of equilibria in a game is invariant to certain transforms of the payoffs (Morris and Ui, 2004). The most well known is the affine transform (offset and positive scale of each player\u2019s payoff). We call such transforms equilibrium-invariant. In addition, there are symmetries in payoffs which result in equivalent symmetries in the set of equilibria (for example, the order of strategies or players). We call transforms over symmetries equilibrium-symmetric. Finally, there is a weaker notion of betterresponse invariance, where transforms do not change a player\u2019s preference over responses to other player\u2019s joint strategies. We call such transforms better-response-invariant. This work studies transforms to produce metric spaces and embeddings over n-player general-sum normal-form games. To motivate the importance of these metric spaces we then focus on 2\u00d72 games: exploring their properties, visualizing their structure, and rediscovering a set of 15 fundamental games.\nCorresponding author(s): marris@deepmind.com\nar X\niv :2\n30 4.\n09 97\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.G T\n] 1\n9 A\npr 2\n02 3\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games\n2\u00d72 normal-form games have two players, each with two strategies. Players take one of the two strategies (possibly at random) simultaneously. The resulting joint strategy triggers a payoff for each player. The game is played only once. The table of payoffs determines rational behaviour of the players (i.e. the set of equilibria). Popular games are given names based on the payoffs and the resulting behaviour. 2\u00d72 games are utilized so frequently that their names have entered popular culture (Figure 1), for example: Chicken, Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, Stag Hunt (Skyrms, 2004), Bach or Stravinsky (battle of the sexes), and Matching Pennies1. The study of such games (Kelley et al., 2002) is crucial to understanding cooperation (Gauthier, 1986), competition, coordination, nature (Wilkinson, 1984), incentive structures (Sugden, 2005), social dilemmas (Bruns and Kimmich, 2021), utilitarian behaviour, rational behaviour (Gintis, 2014), and seemingly irrational behaviour. Games are used to inform economic policy (Ostrom et al., 1994), social structure (Bicchieri, 2005; Binmore and Binmore, 1994; Skyrms, 2004), foreign policy (Schelling, 1966), pandemic response, and environmental treaties (Br\u00e2nzei et al., 2021; Breton et al., 2006; Schosser, 2022).\nAs a result, great effort has been expended in creating parameterizations, taxonomies, topologies, and names for 2\u00d72 games (Brams, 1993; Bruns, 2015; Kilgour and Fraser, 1988; Rapoport and Guyer, 1966; Rapoport et al., 1976; Robinson and Goforth, 2005; Robinson et al., 2007; Walliser, 1988). The most common of these focus on ordinal games, a type of equivalence that recognises that resulting joint strategies in games are only meaningfully different up to the partial ordering of the elements of each player\u2019s payoff. There are 726 such games (Fraser and Kilgour, 1986). Most other work (B\u00f6\u00f6rs et al., 2022; Goforth and Robinson, 2005; Harris, 1969; Huertas-Rosero, 2003; Rapoport and Guyer, 1966) only considers subsets (e.g. symmetric or strictly ordinal) of 2\u00d72 games. Borm (1987) classified all 2\u00d72 games into 15 distinct classes studying their NE best-responses. Fishburn and Kilgour (1990) later showed that these classes can be represented with binary games. Neither provide a notion of closeness, distance metric, or satisfying parameterization for these games.\nThis work uncovers metric spaces and embeddings for general-sum n-player normal-form games. We demonstrate these embeddings in 2\u00d72 games (Figure 2). All nontrivial (Definition 3) 2\u00d72 games can be transformed to an equilibrium-invariant embedding which can be parameterized using only two variables, a reduction from the eight needed to represent the original payoffs (Table 1). Remarkably, this does not change the set of equilibria in the game. Geometrically, each of the two variables describes an angle on a circle and has spatial meaning: similar games are situated near each other. Properties of a game, like equilibrium support, zero-sum-invariance, common-payoff-invariance, whether it is clockwise or anti-clockwise cyclic, whether it is coordination or anti-coordination, and the best-response dynamics, can be easily deduced from this embedding. Using symmetry, the area of equilibrium-invariant embedding can be reduced by a factor of eight to result in the equilibrium-symmetric embedding. Additionally this space can be further reduced to a set of games with a cardinality of 15: the best-response-invariant embedding. Because many equilibrium-invariant embeddings map to the same best-response-invariant embedding, they are also part of equivalence classes. These are the same classes found by Borm (1987), but derived through a different but related argument. We improve upon Borm\u2019s classification by situating them in the equilibrium-invariant embedding, illuminating the relationship between the games. We also provide names and an elegant graphical visualization of the classes.\nFinally, we leverage the tools developed in 2\u00d72 games to study games with more players and strategies, including large normal-form and extensive-form games. Historically, these games have been considered intractable to visualize or summarize. We develop game-theoretic visualizations that fingerprint strategic interactions within these games. The field of machine learning has enjoyed such simplified visualizations of high dimensional complex data. Principled techniques like PCA (Hotelling, 1936; Pearson, 1901) aim to reduce dimensionality, while maintaining the maximum amount of information. Other less principled techniques like t-SNE (Hinton and Roweis, 2003; van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) are also very popular. We hope that our visualizations prove useful for game theory practitioners, where we believe such visualization tools are underdeveloped."

The environment that the agents operate in is called a game. We focus on\n1In this work, we accompany game names with a graphical representation which describes either each player\u2019s preference over joint payoffs for ordinal games (e.g. Matching Pennies) or their best-response preferences for best-response-invariant embeddings (e.g.\nCycle). We describe these representations more thoroughly in later sections.\na particular type of single-shot, simultaneous move game called a normal-form game. A normal-form game consists of \ud835\udc41 players, a set of strategies available to each player \ud835\udc5d, parameterized by \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d \u2208 A\ud835\udc5d = {\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d , \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5d , ...}, and a payoff for each player under a particular joint action, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e), where \ud835\udc4e = (\ud835\udc4e1, ..., \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41 ) = (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d) \u2208 A = \u2297\ud835\udc5dA\ud835\udc5d. The subscript notation \u2212\ud835\udc5d means \u201call players apart from player \ud835\udc5d\u201d. The plural, payoffs, is used to describe payoff of all players, \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc4e) = (\ud835\udc3a1 (\ud835\udc4e), ..., \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc4e)). When the payoff is not parameterized by a joint strategy, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d, it refers to a full tensor of shape [|A1 |, ..., |A\ud835\udc41 |]. Elements of the payoff may be directly described as variables, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d , \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5d) = \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5d . Players need not act deterministically (pure strategy), they can randomize over their strategies (mixed strategy), and their behaviour can be correlated with other players (joint mixed strategy). Players\u2019 behaviour is described by a joint distribution \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e). The goal of each player is to maximize their expected payoff,\u2211\n\ud835\udc4e\u2208A \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e). Players could play independently if the joint factorizes, such that \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e) = \u2297\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d), where \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d) is a marginal mixed strategy. However this is limiting because it does not allow players to coordinate. A mediator called a correlation device could be employed to allow players to execute arbitrary joint strategies \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e) that do not necessarily factorize into their marginals. Such a mediator would sample from a publicly known joint \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e) and secretly communicate to each player their recommended strategy. Game theory is most developed in a subset of games: those with two players and a restriction on the payoffs, \ud835\udc3a1 (\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2) = \u2212\ud835\udc3a2 (\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2), known as zero-sum. Particularly in n-player, general-sum games, there is no definitive solution concept. One approach is to consider joints that are in equilibrium: distributions that no player has incentive to unilaterally deviate from. Games are sometimes referred to by their shape, for example: |A1 | \u00d7 ... \u00d7 |A\ud835\udc41 |. In this work we primarily focus on general-sum 2\u00d72 normal-form games.\nEquilibrium Solution Concepts Broadly, solutions of games are predictions of how self-interested rational players with agency may behave in a game. There are many solutions concepts, however the most popular class are equilibrium solutions that describe stable distributions of player strategies: distributions that no player has incentive to unilaterally deviate from. The most famous is Nash equilibrium (NE) (Nash, 1951) which defines conditions for the set of stable marginal, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d), strategies for each player that can be executed independently. Because of the independence property (also known as factorizable joint property), it is commonly deployed in purely competitive (zero-sum) settings. NE is straightforward to compute2 in two-player zero-sum games where it is interchangeable3 and unexploitable4. NE is considered fundamental in two-player zero-sum games where it is prescriptive. The set of NEs is always nonempty in finite games. However, in general, the set of NEs may be isolated from one another. In general, how to select the best NE is unclear (the equilibrium selection problem (Harsanyi and Selten, 1988)), and finding a specific NE is NP-complete (Austrin et al., 2011). Finding any NE is\n2Solvable in polynomial time. 3If there are any two equilibria (\ud835\udf0e1 (\ud835\udc4e1) , \ud835\udf0e2 (\ud835\udc4e2)) and (\ud835\udf0e\u20321 (\ud835\udc4e1) , \ud835\udf0e \u2032 2 (\ud835\udc4e2)), (\ud835\udf0e1 (\ud835\udc4e1) , \ud835\udf0e \u2032 2 (\ud835\udc4e2)) and (\ud835\udf0e \u2032 1 (\ud835\udc4e1) , \ud835\udf0e2 (\ud835\udc4e2)) are also equilibria. 4When playing the equilibrium there is no response from the opponent that will reduce the payoff.\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games\nPPAD complete (Chen and Deng, 2006; Daskalakis et al., 2009). For n-player mixed-motive normal-form games, other mediated equilibria concepts, such as correlated equilibrium (CE) (Aumann, 1974) and coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) (Hannan, 1957; Moulin and Vial, 1978) may be more suitable. These describe conditions on distributions over stable joint strategies, \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e). (C)CEs permit a larger feasible set of distributions and therefore can result in higher payoffs for players. However, they cannot be executed independently: they require a trusted coordination device to recommend an action to each player. Coordination is a sensible property if the setting allows for it. The key advantage of (C)CEs is that they have linear constraints and form a convex polytope of equilibria. This means the set can be computed in polynomial time for n-player general-sum games.\nWell-Supported Correlated Equilibria (WSCEs) (Czumaj et al., 2014; Goldberg and Papadimitriou, 2006) can be defined in terms of linear inequality constraints. The deviation gain, \ud835\udc34WSCE\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e\u2032\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc4e\u2032\u2032\ud835\udc5d , \ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d), of a player is the change in payoff the player achieves when deviating to strategy \ud835\udc4e\u2032\ud835\udc5d after being recommended strategy \ud835\udc4e\u2032\u2032\ud835\udc5d , when the other players play \ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d. A joint, \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e), is in \ud835\udf16-WSCE if the deviation gain is no more than some constant, \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc5d \u2264 \ud835\udf16, for every recommendation, \ud835\udc4e\u2032\u2032\ud835\udc5d , deviation, \ud835\udc4e\u2032\ud835\udc5d, and player, \ud835\udc5d. The scalar \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc5d describes how approximate the equilibrium is, and also commonly serves a role as a hyperparameter in algorithms where it is usually chosen to be zero. The deviation gain inequality can be expressed as:\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d\u2208A\u2212\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d |\ud835\udc4e\u2032\u2032\ud835\udc5d )\n[ \ud835\udc34WSCE\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e\u2032\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc4e\u2032\u2032\ud835\udc5d , \ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d) := \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e\u2032\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d) \u2212 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e\u2032\u2032\ud835\udc5d , \ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d) ] \u2264 \ud835\udf16\ud835\udc5d \u2200\ud835\udc5d \u2208 [1, \ud835\udc41], \ud835\udc4e\u2032\u2032\ud835\udc5d \u2260 \ud835\udc4e\u2032\ud835\udc5d \u2208 A\ud835\udc5d.

These transforms can be used to reduce the degrees of freedom in the game. The most common invariant transform (Morris and Ui, 2004; Moulin and Vial, 1978; Ostrovski, 2013) is the affine transform (Theorem 1) which consists of an offset over the other players\u2019 strategies and a positive scale. Harsanyi and Selten (1988) argues that invariant transforms and symmetric equivalences are important properties in equilibrium selection. Marris et al. (2022a) leverages both to simplify computing (C)CEs using neural networks. Invariances are also leveraged more generally in machine learning to efficiently optimize over rich topological spaces, e.g., in semidefinite programming and Riemannian optimization (Boumal et al., 2014). The work in this paper utilizes existing equilibrium-invariant transforms to derive a new equilibrium-invariant embedding for general n-player and 2\u00d72 games, and proposes a novel isomorphism (Theorem 4), which is used to rediscover a fundamental set of 2\u00d72 game classes.\n5This is why NEs are harder to compute than (C)CEs.\nTwo-Player Two-Strategy Games 2\u00d72 games are the smallest possible, but have remarkable strategic depth and explain many real-world interactions. As a result, a rich literature has accumulated on explaining, visualizing, categorizing, parameterizing and naming 2\u00d72 games. Naively a 2\u00d72 game (Table 1a) requires 8 variables to define which is too many variables to intuit. Therefore many approaches attempt to reduce this complexity through either using invariances, symmetries and equivalences, or considering a subset of games (for example symmetric, common payoff, or zero-sum games; Tables 1b and 1c). After this reduction in complexity, either a finite set of games or a reduced space of games remains. This set or space may have a structure that describes how close it is to other games. Approaches that simply bin games into a set are categorical approaches. Those that also impose a notion of similarity or closeness between games are topological. Those that impose hierarchical structure to the categorization are called taxonomies. Those that parameterize the game are parametric. Approaches may have multiple properties.\nGames can be characterized based on their payoffs. Rapoport and Guyer (1966)\u2019s \u201ctaxonomy of games\u201d (and book (Rapoport et al., 1976)) exploits a particular equivalence class where only the order of each player\u2019s payoffs matter. Changes in the magnitude of payoffs that do not change the order result in predictable scaling of the equilibrium of the game. Additionally, if we only consider the subset of games that have strict ordering (strict ordinal games) we can represent the payoffs with permutations of the set of ordinal numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}. This results in 4! = 24 ways to strictly order each player\u2019s payoff, which results in 24 \u00d7 24 = 576 games. Utilizing strategy permutations6 for each player reduces the number of strict ordinal games to 144. When including player permutations7 half the non-symmetric games can be removed which reduces the cardinality to 78 strict ordinal games. A drawback of this approach is that it only classifies games with strict payoff orderings. Fraser and Kilgour (1986) introduced the categorization of partially ordered ordinal games (partial ordinal games) where payoffs can take on equal values. This results in a total cardinality of 1413 partially ordered ordinal games with strategy symmetries, or 726 if player symmetries are utilized. Partial ordinal games can be visualized using a graphical representation which shows the ordering of joint preferences (Figure 1). Goforth and Robinson (2005) improved the categorization of strict ordinal games to produce a \u201cperiodic table\u201d. The 144 games were distributed in a 12 \u00d7 12 grid such that adjacent games had similar properties. Robinson et al. (2007) extended this topology to include partially ordered games. Bruns (2015) suggested a formulaic naming scheme for all ordinal games as previously only a small subset (often symmetric games) had established common names.\nHarris (1969) gives a parameterized classification of symmetric 2\u00d72 games using only two variables which are functions of the payoffs (Table 1b): \ud835\udc5f3 = \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\u2212\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc34\u2212\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 and \ud835\udc5f4 = \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc34\u2212\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc34\u2212\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 , with the constraint that \ud835\udc54\n\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc34 > \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35. This defines a plane, with regions that correspond to classes of games with similar properties. Huertas-Rosero (2003) also classifies symmetric 2\u00d72 games into 8 base classes, and 12 total classes based on their NE. B\u00f6\u00f6rs et al. (2022) classifies symmetric 2\u00d72 games into 24 classes based on their decomposition into common-payoff and zero-sum parts. Germano (2006) classifies games into various equivalent classes based on their Nash equilibrium geometry. Borm (1987) classifies all 2\u00d72 games into a set of 15 games based on their best-response characteristics. The games can also be parameterized with 4 discrete variables. Borm did not describe any notions of similarity or distance between games in the set. Our work rediscovers Borm (1987)\u2019s classification through a scale-based payoff transform. In addition, we extend this classification to a metric space, provide a much more efficient two variable embedding of these games, and name these games.\n6The literature phrases this as \u201corder graph\u201d equivalence. 7Sometimes referred to as \u201creflection\u201d in the literature. This symmetry does not quite halve the space because all symmetric games are retained. Of the 78 strict ordinal games, 66 are non-symmetric and 12 are symmetric. The literature is shier to utilize this symmetry because it reverses the roles of players.\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games"

For the embedding this is natural. For distances, the inner product, \u2211 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc3a A,equil \ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e)\ud835\udc3a B,equil \ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e), will be zero which is equivalent to the the payoffs being perpendicular. A trivial payoff would be defined to be perpendicular to all other payoffs. This is not an unreasonable definition, but in our work it is most common to only deal with nontrivial games, or only compare games with identical triviality structure, which we will assume going forward.\nThe equilibrium-invariant embedding is an oblique manifold (Trendafilov and Lippert, 2002) (a product manifold of \ud835\udc41 unit spheres). Each player\u2019s payoff embedding, \ud835\udc3aequil\ud835\udc5d , is a point on the surface of one of these spheres. The distance between two games is the norm of the arc lengths between the two points on each of these spheres. Therefore the maximum distance between two \ud835\udf16 = 0 games is \u221a \ud835\udc41\ud835\udf0b. The equilibrium-invariant embedding reduces the degrees of freedom in each player\u2019s payoff by |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d | + 1. The linear offset component contributes a |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d | portion, while the nonlinear scaling contributes the remaining unit. It turns out that |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d | is the largest reduction that can the achieved by a linear function.\nTheorem 2 (Linear Offset Rank Reduction). The offset component of the equilibrium-invariant embedding reduces a payoff\u2019s degrees of freedom by |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d |. This is the most degrees of freedom that can be reduced with a linear transform without changing the equilibrium.\nProof. The computation of deviation gains, \ud835\udc34, (Equations (1), (2), and (3)) is a linear operation and therefore can be expressed as a matrix multiplication of an operator matrix, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d, with a player\u2019s payoff, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d.

But after matrix multiplying with the operator matrix, which is only rank |A| \u2212 |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d |, the resulting deviation gains can be at most rank |A| \u2212 |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d |. Any linear equilibrium-invariant transform that reduces the space of games by more than |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d | would imply an operator matrix \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5d with rank less than |A| \u2212 |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d |, thereby reducing the number of inequality constraints that define the equilibrium. Therefore, any linear equilibrium-invariant transform can only reduce the space of games by at most |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d | without changing the set of equilibria for all games. The offset component of the affine transform reduces the degrees of freedom by |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d | and, by Theorem 1, does not change the deviation gains.\nReversible Deviation Gains In general, the mapping from payoffs to deviation gains is irreversible because it is not a full-rank linear operation: there are many possible games that result in the same deviation gains. However, in the equilibrium-invariant embedding, there is a one-to-one mapping, and therefore it is possible to reverse the procedure and find the invariant embedding from the deviation gains.\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games\nAlgorithm 1: Equilibrium-Invariant Embedding Sampling Data: |A1 |, ..., |A\ud835\udc41 | Result: \ud835\udc3aequil \ud835\udc41 \u2190 len( |A1 |, ..., |A\ud835\udc41 |); for \ud835\udc5d\u2190 [1, \ud835\udc41] do\nassert |A\ud835\udc5d | \u2265 2; \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e) \u2190 N(0, 1); \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e) \u2190 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) \u2212 1|A\ud835\udc5d | \u2211 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\u2208A\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d); \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) \u2190 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e) | |\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e) | |2 ;\n\ud835\udc3aequil \u2190 concat(\ud835\udc3a1, ..., \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc41 );\nAlgorithm 2: Trivial Embedding Sampling Data: |A1 |, ..., |A\ud835\udc41 | Result: \ud835\udc3atrivial \ud835\udc41 \u2190 len( |A1 |, ..., |A\ud835\udc41 |); for \ud835\udc5d\u2190 [1, \ud835\udc41] do\nassert |A\ud835\udc5d | \u2265 2; \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d) \u2190 N(0, 1); \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) \u2190 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d); \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) \u2190\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e) | |\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e) | |2 ;\n\ud835\udc3atri \u2190 concat(\ud835\udc3a1, ..., \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc41 );\nTheorem 3 (Reversible Deviation Gains).

Firstly, it improves intuition about the space of games and how payoffs relate to the definition of equilibria and their constraints. Secondly, it provides further evidence of the fundamental nature of the equilibrium-invariant embedding. Finally, it opens up a path of research in inverse game theory, which studies the recovery of payoffs from observed equilibrium behaviour.\nSampling Equilibrium-Invariant Embedding It is easy to uniformly sample over the invariant embedding (Algorithm 1) and trivial games (Algorithm 2), where N(0, 1) is a zero-mean unit-variance normal distribution. This sampling approach is principled because it samples games that cover all interesting strategic interactions. Less principled ways of sampling (for example a uniform distribution over entries in the payoff, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) = U(0, 1)), are common in the literature, but may not cover the strategic space of games evenly. We propose that the equilibrium-invariant embedding should be used for evaluating equilibrium solvers and producing training and testing datasets."

This additional constraint does not affect the proof above, so the result also holds for NE and WSNE. The payoffs are only scaled over other players\u2019 strategies, and these scales are positive, which implies better-response-invariance.\nNotably, Theorem 4 does not hold for CCEs.\nTheorem 5 (Per-strategy-scaling CCE counterexample). Per-strategy-scaling of each player\u2019s payoff does not result in reciprocal per-strategy-scaling of CCEs.\nProof. Consider the two-player three-strategy game, scaled-rock-paper-scissors, (\ud835\udc3a1, \ud835\udc3a2), which has a CCE (amongst others) at \ud835\udf0e defined below.\n\ud835\udc3a1 =  0 4 \u22121 \u22122 0 1 2 \u22124 0  \ud835\udc3a2 =  0 \u22121 1 1 0 \u22121 \u22121 1 0  \ud835\udf0e =  0 14 1 12 1 4 0 1 12 0 0 13  (23) Now lets scale this game by \ud835\udc601 = [1, 1, 1] and \ud835\udc602 = [ 12 , 1 4 , 1] to arrive at the familiar rock-paper-scissors game, (\ud835\udc3a1, \ud835\udc3a2).\n\ud835\udc3a1 =  0 1 \u22121 \u22121 0 1 1 \u22121 0  \ud835\udc3a2 =  0 \u22121 1 1 0 \u22121 \u22121 1 0  \ud835\udf0e = 1 \ud835\udc4d  0 1 112 1 2 0 1 12 0 0 13  (24) Note that the scaled version of \ud835\udf0e, \ud835\udf0e, which is calculated according to Theorem 4, is not an equilibrium in the scaled game. Therefore, by counterexample, Theorem 4 does not hold for CCEs in general.\nFortunately, for two-strategy games, CEs and CCEs are equivalent (Monnot and Piliouras, 2017).

Several interesting structural properties emerge (Figure 3), which will be explained in the following sections. Similarly, the partially trivial invariant embedding can be visualized in a single dimension. Partially trivial games, where one of the players does not have any influence in the game, could be described by a single parameter, either \ud835\udf031 or \ud835\udf032, depending on which player contributes to the strategic dynamics. Partially trivial games can therefore be mapped to the partially trivial equilibrium-invariant embedding manifold. Trivial games where no player participates are mapped to a singleton set consisting of the\nNull game. 11Defined as the product manifold of two circles. Topologically this is a torus.

The strategy and player permutation equilibrium-symmetric embedding is north east patterned ( ). Permutation symmetry with zero-sum assumption is vertical patterned ( ).

            "text": "Two-player zero-sum games are well studied in the literature because they are easier to solve than their mixed-motive cousins. In particular for the NE, the problem can be expressed as a min-max optimization. If multiple equilibria exist, all equilibria have the same payoff, and they are known to be interchangeable (it does not matter which equilibrium the opponent chooses). But such games represent a small subset of general-sum games. If we could map a larger set of games onto the space of zero-sum games using invariant transformations, we could prove that they would share these interesting properties.\nTwo such approaches have already been explored in the literature. Firstly, constant-sum games are scalaroffset transformations of zero-sum games, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) \u2192 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5d, which are well known to share zero-sum game\u2019s properties. Secondly, strictly-competitive games (Adler et al., 2009) are scalar-offset and player-scale transformations of zero-sum games, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) \u2192 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5d. However, there exists a larger space of games that can be mapped to zero-sum games.\nDefinition 11 (Invariant-Zero-Sum Games). Invariant-zero-sum games are those that can be mapped to zero-sum games using equilibrium-invariant transformations, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) \u2192 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d) such that \u2211 \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) = 0 \u2200\ud835\udc4e \u2208 A.\nBy definition, the equilibria of invariant-zero-sum games are identical to their zero-sum counterpart. Furthermore, the equilibria are still interchangeable in the transformed game, however not all equilibria will necessarily have the same payoffs. Other generalizations of zero-sum games including strategically zero-sum (Moulin and Vial, 1978), best-response zero-sum (Rosenthal, 1974), and order zero-sum (Shapley, 1963), are all supersets of invariant zero-sum games. The diagonal quadrants (top-left and bottom-right) in the visualization (Figure 3) are invariant-zero-sum. Theorem 7 (Invariant-Zero-Sum Quadrants). When sin(\ud835\udf031) sin(\ud835\udf032) < 0 in Equations (30a) and (30b), the respective game (\ud835\udc3a1 (\ud835\udf031), \ud835\udc3a2 (\ud835\udf032)) is invariant-zero-sum.\nProof. For a game to be invariant-zero-sum there have to exist invariant transforms \ud835\udc602 > 0, \ud835\udc4f1 (\ud835\udc4e2), and \ud835\udc4f2 (\ud835\udc4e1) such that \ud835\udc3a1 (\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2) + \ud835\udc4f1 (\ud835\udc4e2) = \u2212\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc3a2 (\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2) \u2212 \ud835\udc4f2 (\ud835\udc4e1) \u2200\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2.

Invariant-common-payoff games are those that can be mapped to common-payoff games using equilibrium-invariant transformations, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) \u2192 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e) + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e\u2212\ud835\udc5d).\nThese games correspond exactly to the set of 2\u00d72 weighted potential games (Monderer and Shapley, 1996), where the common payoff acts as the potential function. The off-diagonal quadrants (top-right and bottom-left) in the visualization are invariant-common-payoff). Theorem 8 (Invariant-Common-Payoff Quadrants). When sin(\ud835\udf031) sin(\ud835\udf032) > 0 in Equations (30a) and (30b), the respective game (\ud835\udc3a1 (\ud835\udf031), \ud835\udc3a2 (\ud835\udf032)) is invariant-common-payoff.\nProof. For a game to be invariant-common-payoff there has to exist invariant transforms \ud835\udc602 > 0, \ud835\udc4f1 (\ud835\udc4e2), and \ud835\udc4f2 (\ud835\udc4e1) such that \ud835\udc3a1 (\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2) + \ud835\udc4f1 (\ud835\udc4e2) = \ud835\udc602\ud835\udc3a2 (\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2) + \ud835\udc4f2 (\ud835\udc4e1).

Along with the permuted versions of this game, this is the only game with this property.\nTheorem 9 (Dominant Special Case). When sin(\ud835\udf031) = 0 and sin(\ud835\udf032) = 0 in Equations (30a) and (30b), the respective game (\ud835\udc3a1 (\ud835\udf031), \ud835\udc3a2 (\ud835\udf032)) is both invariant-zero-sum and invariant-common-payoff.\nProof. Consider when \ud835\udf031 = \ud835\udf032 = 0. When using transforms \ud835\udc4f1 = [\u221212 , 12 ] and \ud835\udc4f2 = [\u221212 , 12 ] the game becomes zero-sum (Equation (39a)). Additionally, when using transforms \ud835\udc4f1 = [ 12 ,\u2212 1 2 ] and \ud835\udc4f2 = [ 1 2 ,\u2212 1 2 ] the game becomes common-payoff (Equation (39b)).\n\ud835\udc3a1 = \u2212\ud835\udc3a2 = [\n0 12 \u221212 1\n] (39a) \ud835\udc3a1 = \ud835\udc3a2 = [ 1 0 0 \u22121 ] (39b)\nTherefore all symmetric 2\u00d72 games are either invariant-zero-sum, invariant-common-payoff, or both. The borders between the quadrants are neither invariant-zero-sum or invariant-common-payoff. Dominant is the only game which is both invariant-zero-sum and invariant-common-payoff."

Together, this results in Equation (40).\nThis definition of a distance metric on the 2\u00d72 equilibrium-invariant embedding of games is natural. As established in Theorem 6, games with the same equilibria can be embeddings concisely represented by points on two independent unit-circles or equivalently by their angles, i.e., \u0398 = (\ud835\udf031, \ud835\udf032). Distance along a unit-circle is measured by arc length. Therefore, the natural way to measure distance between two games is to sum the arc lengths between their embeddings on both circles. More generally, we can consider measuring distances between games\u2019 representations using any \ud835\udc5d-norm. In summary, the distance, \ud835\udc51, between two games can be found by a) converting the game to the equilibrium-invariant embedding, b) calculating the arc length between each component of the two embeddings, and c) finding a distance using any \ud835\udc5d-norm, where \u0398\ud835\udc34 = (\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc341 , \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc34 2 ) and \u0398\ud835\udc35 = (\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc351 , \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc35 2 ).\nFor all norms with \ud835\udc5d < \u221e, there is a unique game which maximizes the distance to any other game.

Sometimes we refer to best-response-invariant embeddings, and sometimes we refer to the equivalence classes they belong to. The best-response-invariant embeddings can be thought of as canonical (fundamental) examples of games within each equivalence class. The equilibria (WSNE, NE, WSCE, CE, and CCE) of all games within each equivalence class can be calculated through simple scaling of the equilibria of these fundamental games. Of the 15 equivalent game classes, 11 are nontrivial, 3 are partially trivial, and 1 is trivial. These 15 classes are the same as those proposed by Borm (1987) and correspond to games with the same best-response dynamics.

We can follow a similar derivation for player 2. As a result, 9 \u00d7 9 = 81 games are possible in total. Of these 64 are nontrivial, 16 are partially trivial and 1 is trivial. The permutation symmetries discussed earlier facilitate the observation that only 15 of the games are unique up to symmetric equivalence.\nThe best-response-invariant embedding set could have been defined using binary payoffs (Fishburn and Kilgour, 1990) because we only need to establish preferences over the strategies. However we opt for ternary payoffs (\u22121, 0, +1) because theymore clearly differentiate the three possibilities: preferring strategy \ud835\udc34, preferring strategy \ud835\udc35, or being indifferent. This preference ordering is equivalent to the best-response dynamics of each player. For two-strategy games, better-response and best-response dynamics are identical. Better-response invariance is closely related to the affine transform used to derive the equilibrium-invariant embedding (Morris and Ui, 2004; Ostrovski, 2013). Equilibrium-invariance implies better-response-invariance, which in turn implies best-response-invariance."

This ordering can be simply visualized as a directed graph: player 1\u2019s column ordering can be indicated with vertical arrows (for example indicates player 1 prefers strategy \ud835\udc35 when player 2 plays \ud835\udc34, and \ud835\udc34 when player 2 players \ud835\udc35), and player 2\u2019s row ordering can be indicated with horizontal arrows (for example ).

The set of directed graphs have 15 equivalence classes with respect to graph isomorphism.\nMost of the games in the best-response-invariant embedding have measure-zero equivalence classes within the equilibrium-invariant embedding, meaning the probability they are randomly sampled is zero. There is a simple rule of thumb to determine the measure of an equivalence class: a) if no players are indifferent when best-responding, the game is positive measure, b) if one player is indifferent when best responding to one action, the class is zero-measure and is a \u201cboundary class\u201d appearing between two positive measure classes, and c) if both players are indifferent to one of the opponent\u2019s actions, the class is a \u201cpoint class\u201d appearing between four boundary classes. It is easy to visually inspect (Figure 14) that only 4 of the games have positive probability of being sampled: Samaritan, Dominant, Coordination, and Cycle (Table 3). This provides intuition to why the measure-zero games rarely appear in the literature. Our observation matches similar analysis made by Borm (1987)."

            "text": "Borm (1987) provided numerical classification for the 15 fundamental classes of games. We have already specified parameterized embeddings, (\ud835\udf031, \ud835\udf032) or (\ud835\udf19coord, \ud835\udf19cycle), and a graphical representation. In addition, the set is small enough to benefit from a standardised naming scheme. We attempt to, as far as possible, follow established naming conventions and draw inspiration from previous work (Bruns, 2015). Symmetric games (those that lie on \ud835\udf031 = \ud835\udf032 or \ud835\udf19cycle = 0) are the most well-studied and have established common names. Only some non-symmetric games such as Matching Pennies and Samaritan\u2019s Dilemma have been studied. Care was taken not to name classes after games that are similar but subtly different (e.g. Stag Hunt and\nChicken were deliberately avoided). The majority of the games have strategies which players are indifferent between. These classes of games are little studied and therefore do not have common names. Table 3 shows the names chosen for the 15 fundamental games proposed in this work.\nDominant In this symmetric game (Figure 4a) each player has a strictly dominant strategy. Therefore, this game has a single pure NE and (C)CE . The Dominant embedding is at the origin of the equilibriuminvariant embedding, like other topologies (Rapoport et al., 1976), and is the only 2\u00d72 game that is both\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games\nnant, Coordination, Cycle, Samaritan, and Null have been well studied and have established names.

Dominant has many common games within its equivalence class including Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, Peace, Deadlock, Total Conflict, Concord, and Compromise. In particular, Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma is one of the most studied games in economics. The dominant equivalence class occurs with probability 14 when sampling uniformly over the equilibrium-invariant embedding. Furthermore, this class is the most diverse: games within the class can be anti-clockwise invariant-zero-sum, clockwise invariant-zero-sum, diagonal invariant-common-payoff, off-diagonal invariant-common-payoff, or none.\nCoordination Coordination (Figure 4b) is a symmetric common-payoff coordination game where there are two equally desirable outcomes. Players simply have to coordinate to ensure they achieve one of them. Coordination has two pure NEs ( and ) with equal payoff and a low payoff mixed NE . It is the only nontrivial game with a positive volume of (C)CE equilibria. Coordination has many games within its equivalence class including Stag Hunt, Chicken, Assurance, and Bach or Stravinsky. The Coordination equivalence class occurs with probability 18 when sampling uniformly over the equilibrium-invariant embedding. All games in the coordination equivalence class are invariant-common-payoff.\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games\nCycle This game is an anti-symmetric zero-sum game (Figure 4c), also commonly called Matching Pennies. In this game, the first player prefers both players to play the same strategy (for example, both heads or both tails), and the second player prefers each player to play a different strategy. The best-responses of the pure strategies result in cyclic dynamics. A similar three strategy variant of this game with the same property, Rock Paper Scissors, is a popular children\u2019s game. Permuting the strategies of a player will result in changing the game from a clockwise cycle to an anti-clockwise cycle. Cycle has no pure NEs, a single completely mixed NE (with uniform probability) and (C)CE . Cycle is the only game where all equilibria are strictly in the interior of the simplex. All games within Cycle\u2019s best-response-invariant equivalence class are also cyclic, but with different biases on the strategies they prefer. This class occurs with probability 18 when sampling uniformly over the equilibrium-invariant embedding.\nSamaritan This game (Figure 4d) has a worker player and a Samaritan player. The worker has two strategies: rest (R) or work (W). The Samaritan has two strategies: help (H) or do not help (N). The Samaritan always prefers to help but also prefers it when the worker also works (and so does not free-load). The worker prefers not to work if they receive help but prefers to work to sustain themselves if they do not receive help. Samaritan has a single pure NE and (C)CE . It is named after Samaritan\u2019s Dilemma (Schmidtchen, 2002), a game proposed by Buchanan (1975). Samson (Brams, 1993), Alibi (Robinson and Goforth, 2005), Anticipation, Bully, Hamlet, Asymmetric Dilemma, and Called Bluff are all in this game\u2019s better-response-invariant equivalence class. The Samaritan embedding is neither zero-sum-invariant nor common-payoff-invariant. However other games within its equivalence class can be either zero-sum-invariant or common-payoff-invariant, or neither. Samaritan equivalence class is special because it occurs with the highest probability 12 when sampling uniformly over the equilibrium-invariant embedding. As well as being the most common class, it is also the class most closely connected to all other games (Section 6.4).\nHazard In Hazard (Figure 4e), player 1 is an insurance company that can either insure (I) or decline (D) player 2\u2019s health insurance. Player 2 enjoys drinking at parties, which is risky behaviour (R), but also appreciates the health benefits of not drinking, which is careful behaviour (C). Overall, in the absence of health insurance, player 2 is indifferent to a party lifestyle or a healthy one. However, if player 1 issues medical insurance, player 2 will have a greater risk tolerance and will adopt a party lifestyle. Player 1 does not make any money if it does not issue insurance, makes money if it does and player 2 opts for a healthy lifestyle, and loses money if it issues insurance to an unhealthy lifestyle. Bruns (2015) briefly defines a game that he describes as a moral hazard, with the formulaic name \u201cMiddle Hunt \u00d7 Low Dilemma\u201d. Hazard has a single pure NE , a mixed NE , and (C)CEs with support . The hazard equivalence class has an indifference and so is zero-measure in the equilibrium-invariant embedding. However it is a boundary class which borders the Cycle equivalence class. Of the boundary classes it occurs with probability 14 when uniformly sampling over the equilibrium-invariant embedding. All games within this equivalence class are invariant-zero-sum.\nSafety This game (Figure 4f) is also hinted at by Bruns (2015) in which it was called \u201cMiddle Hunt \u00d7 Low Concord\u201d. It is similar to Hazard, except the insurer now incentivizes player 1 into a healthy lifestyle with free gym membership. This fixes the moral hazard and now player 2 is incentivized to have a healthy lifestyle with insurance. Safety has two pure NEs ( and ), a mixed NE and (C)CEs . The Safety equivalence class has an indifference and so is zero-measure in the equilibrium-invariant embedding. However it is a boundary class which borders the Coordination equivalence class. Of the boundary classes it occurs with probability 14 when uniformly sampling over the equilibrium-invariant embedding. All games within this equivalence class are invariant-common-payoff.\nAidos In Aidos (Figure 4g), player 1 is a deity and can either reveal themselves (R) or not (N), however they are shy and strictly prefer not to reveal themselves. Player 2 is a human and wants to believe what is true. With lack of evidence either way, the human is indifferent to the existence of the deity, however if the deity reveals themselves they prefer to believe (B) rather than not believe (N). There are two pure NEs ( and ), and any mixture of these is also a mixed NE and (C)CE. The theme of this game is inspired by Revelation (Brams, 1993), a game with similar dynamics. The Aidos equivalence class has an indifference and so is zero-measure in the equilibrium-invariant embedding. However it is a boundary class which borders\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games\nthe Dominant and Samaritan equivalence classes in the region where the pure equilibrium strategy changes (in contrast to Picnic, described next). Of the boundary classes it occurs with probability 14 when uniformly sampling over the equilibrium-invariant embedding. The games in Aidos\u2019 equivalence class can be either zero-sum-invariant, common-payoff-invariant, or neither. The only game in the set that is neither is the Aidos embedding.\nPicnic In this game (Figure 4h) a host can either organise a picnic (P) or order takeaway (T) and they strictly prefer organising a picnic. A guest can either attend (A) or decline (D). They are indifferent about attending when takeaway is ordered but would prefer to attend if a picnic is organised. Picnic has a single pure NE . The Picnic equivalence class has an indifference and so is zero-measure in the equilibrium-invariant embedding. However it is a boundary class which borders the Dominant and Samaritan equivalence classes in the region where the pure equilibrium strategy does not change (in contrast to Aidos). Of the boundary classes it occurs with probability 14 when uniformly sampling over the equilibrium-invariant embedding. The Picnic embedding is neither zero-sum-invariant nor common-payoff-invariant, however games in its equivalence class can be either zero-sum-invariant or common-payoff-invariant.\nDaredevil In the literature, Chicken (Figure 1a) has two pure anti-coordination NEs ( and ) and a single mixed NE which places the majority of the mass on the worst joint outcome. The presence of a mixed NE means that Chicken has a full-support equilibrium and therefore falls into the equivalence class of\nCoordination. However, there is another interesting symmetric, invariant-common-payoff, measure-zero equivalence class game, Daredevil (Figure 4i), with properties similar to Chicken. This game has the same two pure anti-coordination NEs ( and ), and an additional pure NE : crash. There is no completely mixed NE, but there are are also two pure-mixed NEs ( and ). It also has (C)CEs which can mix arbitrarily over any of the pure NEs. The game differs from Chicken in the fact that if the other player chooses not to swerve, the player is indifferent to whether they swerve and avoid damage or continue and crash. It has similar dynamics to, and can be thought of as, an extreme edge-case of Chicken. To our knowledge, this game has not been studied before in the literature - perhaps unsurprising because it has a measure-zero equivalence class. Daredevil is a point class because the Daredevil embedding is the only game within its class. It is invariant-common-payoff and borders the Aidos and Safety equivalence classes. Of the three point classes, it occurs with probability 14 .\nFossick In the literature, Stag Hunt (Figure 1c) is a game with two pure coordination NEs ( and ), where one is preferred over the other, and a completely mixed NE . Stag Hunt is also in the equivalence class of Coordination. Fossick (Figure 4j) is an extreme version of Stag Hunt which has two pure NEs( and ), but no mixed NE. It also has (C)CEs that can mix over only the coordination strategies . In this game players are in a gold rush and can either search for water to sustain themselves in the wilderness or fossick for gold. If the other player searches for water, the player is indifferent to what they search for. However if the other player fossicks for gold, the player would feel left out and would prefer to also fossick for gold. To our knowledge, this game has not been studied before in the literature. Fossick is part of a zero-measure equivalence class, and is also a point class (the Fossick embedding is the only game in the equivalence class). Of the three point classes, it occurs with probability 14 . Fossick is invariant-common-payoff.\nHeist In Heist (Figure 4k), player 1 is a nervous robber and can either do nothing (N) or stage a heist (H). Player 2 is a security guard and can either go on patrol (P) or rest (R). If the robber does not stage a heist, the security guard is indifferent to whether they are on patrol or at rest. However if a heist does occur the guard prefers to be on patrol. If the security guard is at rest, the robber is unsure if the heist is worth the risk and is indifferent. However if the security guard is on patrol, the robber prefers not to stage a heist. This game is most similar to Pursuit (Brams, 1993). Heist has two pure NEs ( and ), and (C)CEs that mix between them . Heist is part of a zero-measure equivalence class, and is also a point class. Of the three point classes, Heist is the most common and occurs with probability 12 . Heist is invariant-zero-sum.\nIgnorance Ignorance (Figure 4l) is a partially trivial game where one of the players has no preferences at all. In Ignorance, an informed player wants to win (W) and avoid losing (L) and an ignorant player is indifferent between their strategies and outcomes. Ignorance has two pure NEs ( and ), a mixed NE\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games\nand (C)CE . The equivalence class of Ignorance occurs with probability 12 when sampling uniformly over the partially-trivial equilibrium-invariant embedding.\nHorseplay Horseplay (Figure 4m) is a partially trivial game where one of the players has no preferences at all. Horseplay is a game between an adult and a child. The child can either lift up their arms (A) or curl into a ball (B), they are indifferent to which they do or what the outcome is, they are just happy to play. For convenience, the adult will prefer to throw (T) the child into the air if they have their arms up, or lift them up by their feet (L) if they are curled into a ball. Horseplay has two pure NEs ( and ), three mixed NEs ( , , and ), and full support (C)CEs . The equivalence class of Horseplay occurs with probability 12 when sampling uniformly over the partially-trivial equilibrium-invariant embedding.\nDress Described by Simpson (2010), Dress (Figure 4n) is a game where two people are going on a date. Player 1 selfishly wishes their partner to dress formally (F), and only if they do so, also lazily prefers to dress for comfort (C). Player 2 also wants their partner to dress formally, but is indifferent to what they wear themselves. Because player 2\u2019s preferences are solely based on the other player\u2019s strategies, their payoffs are trivial, so Dress is a partially trivial game. This game has three pure NEs, and any mixture between those three NEs ( , , and ), two mixed NEs ( and ), and (C)CEs . The equivalence class of Dress is a boundary class between Ignorance and Horseplay. It is measure-zero when sampling uniformly over the partially-trivial equilibrium-invariant embedding.\nNull In the Null game (Figure 4o, players have no preferences over strategies which means any pure or mixed strategy is an NE and any joint distribution is a (C)CE . Games of the form \ud835\udc3a1 (\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2) = \ud835\udc4f1 (\ud835\udc4e2), \ud835\udc3a2 (\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2) = \ud835\udc4f2 (\ud835\udc4e1) are in the Null equivalence class. Null is a point game and is the only class of trivial games. This game is sometimes called the Zero game or Trivial game."

Cycle is the most isolated game with the greatest average distance to other games. Samaritan is the least isolated game with the smallest average distance to other games. No game is more than two steps12 away from Samaritan. Out of the partially trivial games, Dress is a boundary class between Ignorance and Horseplay. Small perturbations in payoffs can change the game and cause step changes in the equilibrium. The distance metrics (and the topology) show the possible adjacent games that small perturbations could result in. Such an analysis could be useful in selecting equilibria that are robust to permutations or dealing with uncertainty in payoffs. We expand on this more in the discussion section."

The standard constraints on a probability distribution apply: probabilities are nonnegative, \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e) \u2265 0 \u2200\ud835\udc4e \u2208 A, and sum to unity, \u2211\ud835\udc4e\u2208A \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e) = 1. The unity sum constraint means that a distribution over the four strategies of a 2\u00d72 game, can be expressed with only three variables because one is redundant given the rest (e.g. \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35) = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34) \u2212 \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35) \u2212 \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc34)). This means it is possible to visualize a joint distribution with four components in only three dimensions, by ignoring the space of distributions that do not sum to unity. Typically this is accomplished by specifying four vertices of a tetrahedron (a three\n12Steps or \u201chops\u201d are measured over the planar grid visualized in Figure 3.\ndimensional object). Points in the simplex are then described in terms of mixtures of these four vertices (known as a barycentric coordinate system M\u00f6bius (1827)). Barycentric coordinates, \ud835\udf48, can be converted to Cartesian coordinates, \ud835\udc99, via a linear transform, \ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udf48. The columns of \ud835\udc47 are points of a regular tetrahedron. There are many ways to choose points of a tetrahedron, one is given in Equation (48).\n\ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udf48 \ud835\udc47 =  \u221212\n1 2 0 0\n\u2212 \u221a 3 6 \u2212 \u221a 3 6\n\u221a 3 6 0\n\u2212 \u221a 6 12 \u2212 \u221a 6 12 \u2212 \u221a 6 12 \u221a 6 4  (48) Each nonnegative inequality constraint geometrically corresponds to a normal vector in the equation of a plane (e.g. [1, 0, 0, 0]\ud835\udf48\ud835\udc47 \u2265 0). These planes split the space into two halves: those that are feasible\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games\ndistributions and those that are infeasible distributions. Together the four nonnegative probability inequality constraints result in a convex polytope with four faces, specifically a regular tetrahedron, when visualized in three dimensions (Figure 6a). \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2) corresponds to a full joint distribution. A subset of joints that factorize into their marginals, \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2) = \ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e1)\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc4e2), is worth highlighting because of its relationship to NEs which by definition have to factorize. Factorizable joints result in a manifold within the tetrahedron (Figure 6b).\nNow consider a player\u2019s payoff, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2). We know that each player\u2019s 2\u00d72 equilibrium-invariant embedding is parameterized by an angle, \ud835\udc3aequil\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5d), on a circle. This circle can be meaningfully traced in three-dimensions: \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5d) = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc88equil\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5d). A particular payoff for a player, \ud835\udc3a equil \ud835\udc5d , can be represented by drawing an arrow from the origin to a point on this circle. The direction of this arrow conveys meaning: it is the direction which linearly increases the equilibrium-invariant embedding payoff received under a joint, and it points to the region where equilibria are likely to reside. The original payoffs, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5d), could be any vectors perpendicular to the plane that the circle lies on.\nThe deviation gains (Equations (1), (2), and (3)) of the various equilibrium concepts can also be visualized. Each row of the deviation gain matrix corresponds to a half plane. The rows in aggregate make a convex polytope, which can also be visualized in three dimensions. NEs are where this polytope intersects with the factorizable joint manifold.\nWe propose a visualization of 2\u00d72 games that includes their equilibrium-invariant embedding, best-responseinvariant embedding, (C)CE polytope and NE set (Figure 7). When the arrows are near opposite, the game is invariant-zero-sum (for example Cycle, Figure 7a). When the arrows are near alignment, the game is invariant-common-payoff (for example Coordination, Figure 7b). Dominant games have near perpendicular vectors. Sometimes a continuum of NEs is feasible, when that is the case it will be shown with a dashed line (for example Horseplay, Figure 7c)."

However, subgame perfection is not representable in normal-form.\nLarge two-player games can be represented as a point cloud of sampled equilibrium-invariant embeddings. We propose that properties of the game can be deduced from the positions and density of the the embeddings in this plot. We call this sampling scheme global because all strategies are uniformly sampled over the full normal-form game being analysed.\nExtensive-Form Games We visualize (Figure 8) three two-player extensive-form games taken from the OpenSpiel library (Lanctot et al., 2019). All extensive-form games can be converted to normal-form games by considering the enumeration of pure-strategy policies available to each player. To produce our visualization we do not require enumeration of all policies; instead we can simply sample random pure joint policies to approximate the visualization allowing us to scale analysis to large extensive-form games. Because all the games considered in this visualization are asymmetric, we do not utilize player symmetry. We sample strategies arbitrarily from the payoffs, so the order of strategies is also arbitrary and we can utilize strategy symmetry. Therefore, the plots cover the domain: \u2212\ud835\udf0b2 \u2264 \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5d < \ud835\udf0b 2 .\nKuhn Poker (Kuhn, 1950) is an asymmetric, zero-sum simplified poker variant. First, notice that all points lie in invariant-zero-sum quadrants, which is what the theory predicts for a two-player zero-sum extensive-form game. Interestingly, many boundary classes ( Aidos, Picnic, and Hazard) appear. This shows that this game has situations where players are indifferent between strategies. Kuhn poker does have a high concentration of points in the Dominant and Samaritan classes indicating that in most situations there are obvious strategies that either both or at least one of the players should choose. There are also a significant number of Cycle interactions which indicates that this game has some interesting strategic depth.\nTwo-player Cooperative Tiny Bridge (Lockhart et al., 2020) is a common-payoff game.

The games are asymmetric so we can utilize strategy permutation but not player permutation to plot the interactions on a reduced invariant embedding.\npoints lie in the invariant-common-payoff quadrants of the visualization. The game also has a high concentration of points near the origin indicating that most strategic interaction is Dominant: both players have a strict preference between strategies. Coordination also features prominently, indicating there are situations that require players to coordinate to maximize payoffs. It seems no boundary classes appear in Tiny Bridge meaning that it is rare for players to be indifferent over their strategies.\nSheriff (Farina et al., 2019) is an asymmetric, mixed-motive game. The point cloud of this game covers both invariant-common-payoff and invariant-zero-sum quadrants, however it predominately occupies the invariant-zero-sum quadrant indicating that the game is more competitive than cooperative.

In early and late training, the local strategic space is mostly transitive (Dominant), and in mid training the space is cyclic (Cycle). This matches Czarnecki et al. (2020)\u2019s \u201cspinning top\u201d hypothesis in games of skill.\nAlphaStar League The AlphaStar league is a symmetric zero-sum, 888 \u00d7 888, empirical normal-form game. It consists of payoffs between policies learned by AlphaStar (Vinyals et al., 2019). The visualization of this game is shown in Figure 9a. The game is symmetric, so we can utilize player symmetry. The game is zero-sum, so we only need to consider zero-sum quadrants. This plot is also strategy invariant, so we could have utilized strategy symmetry. However, to have a simpler comparison to Figure 9b, we do not use strategy symmetry. Therefore the plot is over the domain: 0 \u2264 \ud835\udf031 \u2264 \ud835\udf0b and \u2212\ud835\udf0b \u2264 \ud835\udf032 \u2264 0, although outside of 0 \u2264 \ud835\udf031 \u2264 \ud835\udf0b2 and \u2212\ud835\udf0b2 \u2264 \ud835\udf032 \u2264 0 the plot is redundant. The empirical game mainly has Dominant strategic interaction, although there are significant Samaritan and Cycle components.\nCzarnecki et al. (2020) hypothesised that games of skill have few cyclic interactions early in training as policies can easily transitively improve. In mid training, there are numerous reasonably competent and diverse policies, which results in interesting cyclic interactions. However, in late training, the interactions between policies become less cyclic, as the skills needed to play the game are perfected. Czarnecki et al.

Later strategies are policies trained against distributions over previous policies. Therefore, later policies have more training time and have trained against more diverse opponents, and will more likely be stronger. But what does the strategic landscape of the game look like at each stage of training? By analysing the game around background strategies which correspond to early, middle and late training, we can test Czarnecki et al. (2020)\u2019s hypothesis (Figure 9b).\nUnsurprisingly, early training primarily occupies a Dominant region, where players strictly wish to deviate from the their weakly trained fixed background policy. In contrast, late training primarily occupies the opposite Dominant region, where players strictly prefer to stick with their fixed background strategies. Mid training has a varied strategic space, but has more mass in the Cycle region than the other background policies. Broadly, this analysis supports the \u201cspinning top\u201d hypothesis. A deeper analysis of the training timeline could uncover more structure."

Because the order of the players and strategies matter in this pairwise approximation of an n-player game, it is necessary to use the full invariant space: \u2212\ud835\udf0b \u2264 \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5f \u2264 +\ud835\udf0b and \u2212\ud835\udf0b \u2264 \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50 \u2264 +\ud835\udf0b. It is unnecessary to plot both permutations of the player pairs: the point cloud will be the same but mirrored over \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50.\nConsidering only pairwise player interaction is an established succinct game representation called the polymatrix approximation (Janovskaja, 1968). This representation is described by the tuple (\ud835\udc3a1,2 (\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2), \ud835\udc3a1,3 (\ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e3), ..., \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc41\u22121,\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41 , \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc41\u22121)). By fixing the background strategies in an n-player normal-form game we create a local polymatrix approximation around these background strategies. We need not restrict ourselves to strategies in a normal-form game. We can instead sample entire policies, ?\u0303?\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5d, in extensive-form games around fixed background policies, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc34...\ud835\udc34 = (\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc341 , ..., \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc41 ). Either stochastic or deterministic policies can be sampled (we sample deterministic policies in our experiments). Therefore the visualization can be used to approximate the strategic dynamics of a game around salient policies, such as the policies players are currently executing in a game, or perhaps ones that have been found using a learning method. We expect the local polymatrix approximation landscape to be different around different background policies, as policies influence transition dynamics in the game.\n\ud835\udc3alocal\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e (?\u0303?\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5d , ?\u0303?\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5e ) = [ \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d , \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5e , \ud835\udf0b...\u2212\ud835\udc5d\u2212\ud835\udc5e) \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d , ?\u0303?\ud835\udc352 , \ud835\udf0b ... \u2212\ud835\udc5d\u2212\ud835\udc5e)\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(?\u0303?\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5d , \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5e , \ud835\udf0b...\u2212\ud835\udc5d\u2212\ud835\udc5e) \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d(?\u0303?\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5d , ?\u0303?\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5e , \ud835\udf0b...\u2212\ud835\udc5d\u2212\ud835\udc5e)\n] \u2192 (\ud835\udf03local\ud835\udc5d , \ud835\udf03local\ud835\udc5e ) \u2200\ud835\udc5d \u2260 \ud835\udc5e \u2208 [1, \ud835\udc41] (53)\nThree-Player Leduc Poker Leduc poker (Southey et al., 2005), implemented in OpenSpiel (Lanctot et al., 2019), is a simplified Texas Hold\u2019em implementation with \ud835\udc41 players, two suits and 2(\ud835\udc41 + 1) cards. We study the three-player game (Figure 10), with each player respectively having the background policies: always raise, always call, and always fold. If any of these actions are infeasible at an information state, the policy will fall back to the call action. Unsurprisingly, given players must pay a blind, always fold is a losing strategy. This is most apparent when analysing call vs fold where call is almost always the best strategy to play. The majority of the points are in the basins of games along the \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50 axis: Dominant and Samaritan. This indicates two properties. Firstly, that call is almost always a dominant strategy for the row player (in the context of the other background policies), regardless of the column player\u2019s strategy. Secondly, the strength of the fold strategy depends on what the other players play. It is sometimes good ( Dominant and Samaritan), and sometimes bad ( Dominant and Samaritan). Fold is also poor in the context of fold vs raise. Deviating from fold is sometimes a better strategy ( Dominant and Samaritan) but there are situations where it is\nnot ( Dominant and Samaritan). It is very rare for fold to be the worse strategy when playing against the other background policies, but be the preferred strategy against the deviation strategy ( Samaritan). Generally, clustering around the \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50 axis indicates a strong row player and clustering around the \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5f axis indicates a strong column player. The raise vs call dynamics are interesting: the majority of the points lie in the anti-clockwise invariant-zero-sum region. Player 3, who always folds, plays such a weak strategy that they are an irrelevant player and the local raise vs call two-player game is almost perfectly zero-sum. Call is usually a good strategy against raise and a poor strategy against deviations from raise, and while raise is a poor strategy against call it is usually a good strategy against deviations, resulting in a Cycle. The majority of the points for all the local games lie in the invariant-zero-sum quadrants, which is unsurprising because this is a zero-sum game. Only two-player invariant-zero-sum games lie completely in the invariant-zero-sum quadrants.\nTiny Bridge 2vs2 Tiny Bridge is an extensive-form, two versus two, team game (Lockhart et al., 2020) implemented in OpenSpiel (Lanctot et al., 2019) with zero-sum dynamics between teams and common-payoff dynamics within the team. The game is a simplified version of the popular card game Contract Bridge, but consists of only two suits each with four cards. Using the polymatrix visualization tools described above we study the dynamics of Tiny Bridge. In doing this we verify that the visualization a) captures interesting dynamics between teammates and opponents, and b) is able to differentiate between dynamics under different background policies. To produce quantifiably different policies, we generate twelve random deterministic policies for each player, compute an empirical normal-form game from their expected returns (Wellman, 2006) (Figure 11b), and rate them using a game theoretic rating scheme (Marris et al., 2022b) (Figure 11a). The ratings scheme is calculated on expected payoff under a joint equilibrium distribution (Figure 11c). We choose to use a maximum entropy CCE. We select the strongest policies as the \u201cbest vs best\u201d background set (Figure 12a) and the strongest of team 1 with the weakest of team 2 as the \u201cbest vs worst\u201d background set (Figure 12b). The local polymatrix approximation of each set is visualized using a different colour for each of the pairwise interactions. The mixed set contains (relatively) strong policies for team 1: they are good at countering their opponents and good at coordinating with each other. The strong set contains competent policies for all players.\nThe two teams, labeled 1 and 2, each have two players, labeled A and B. For both sets, as expected, the common-payoff intra-team dynamics ( 1A vs 1B and 2A vs 2B) only lie in the off-diagonal quadrants and the zero-sum inter-team dynamics ( 1A vs 2A, 1A vs 2B, 1B vs 2A, and 1B vs 2B) lie in the diagonal quadrants. Focusing on intra-team dynamics ( 1A vs 1B and 2A vs 2B), for the best vs best background set the point cloud is concentrated around Dominant and Samaritan. This indicates that both teams have good intra-team cooperation. However for the best vs worst background set, the worse team\u2019s policies ( 2A vs 2B) have poor intra-team cooperation. Points are clustered around Dominant and Samaritan, indicating that deviating away from the background policy is advantageous. Focusing on inter-team dynamics, the best vs worst background set shows that team 1 out-competes team 2 ( 1A vs 2A, 1A vs 2B, 1B vs 2A, and 1B vs 2B). The points are clustered along the \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50 axis which indicates a stronger row player. Furthermore, the points are primarily in the basins of Samaritan and Dominant: showing that the row player prefers its background policy over deviations and the column player prefers deviations over background policy. Player 1A\u2019s dynamics ( 1A vs 2A and 1A vs 2B) are closer to the \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50 axis than player 1B\u2019s dynamics ( 1B vs 2A and\n1B vs 2B) indicating that out of the two players on team 1, A is more competitive. This is not surprising as 1A plays first which has a natural advantage in Bridge as they have first opportunity to bid and convey information. The inter-team dynamics in the best vs best background policies are more balanced."

            "text": "In this work we derived distance metrics and embeddings for n-player general-sum normal-form games, such that they are equilibrium-invariant, equilibrium-symmetric, and better-response-invariant. Similar metrics and embeddings could be readily derived for other succinct representations of games such as polymatrix, symmetric, zero-sum, or common-payoff.\nTo explore equilibrium-invariance, we focused on the most popular equilibrium solution concepts including NEs, CEs, and CCEs. Other equilibria such as quantal response equilibrium (QRE) (McKelvey and Palfrey, 1995) may also be compatible with the equilibrium-invariant embedding we derived in this work. There may also be interesting connections to evolutionary stable strategies (ESS). We leave verification of other equilibrium concepts to future work.\nTheorem 3 highlighted the direct connection between the deviation gains and the equilibrium-invariant embedding. Since the deviation gains directly describe the space of equilibria, if one knows the equilibria of a system, one could estimate the deviation gains, and hence the equilibrium-invariant embeddings. Therefore the equilibrium-invariant embedding could be a useful tool in inverse game theory.\nA metric-space can be useful in performing perturbation analysis (as hinted in Section 6.4). It is not uncommon for payoffs to be estimated from data, such as in empirical game-theoretic analysis (EGTA) (Walsh et al., 2002; Wellman, 2006). Such payoffs have uncertainty, and small changes in the payoffs can cause large changes to the resulting equilibria. A notion of distance between games can help answer questions about how a game\u2019s equilibria may change with a different estimate. For example, is it near an equivalence class boundary, or about to switch from being invariant-zero-sum to invariant-common-payoff?\nPopular game-theoretic rating methods, like Nash Average (Balduzzi et al., 2018), are used to rate and rank strategies in normal-form games. These rankings are invariant to affine transforms of the payoffs (Section B). Therefore the equilibrium-invariant embedding preserves the game-theoretic ranking of strategies, which is further evidence of its fundamental nature.\nFurthermore, we discovered a novel per-strategy scale better-response-invariant transform, that can be used to derive a set of 2\u00d72 best-response-invariant embeddings. After symmetry, this results in 15 equivalence\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games\nclasses. This same set has been identified previously by studying best-responses of 2\u00d72 games (Borm, 1987). There is a deep connection between best-response-invariance and equilibrium-invariance (Morris and Ui, 2004). However, this work also provides an equilibrium-invariant embedding, distance measure, efficient parameterization, graph representation, and naming scheme for the best-response-invariant embeddings.\nWe note that the majority of the games in the best-response-invariant embedding have indifferences (11 out of 15). Indifferences cannot be captured in ordinal payoffs: partially ordinal payoffs are required. However, popular topologies and classifications for 2\u00d72 games only focus on ordinal games. We argue that such a choice both a) limits the space of interesting games that are studied, and b) places too much prominence on games without indifferences which are highly redundant, comprising of only 4 out of 15 of the best-response-invariant equivalence classes.\nThe 2\u00d72 best-response-invariant embeddings can be used quickly to calculate equilibria for any 2\u00d72 game, simply by storing the extreme points of the (C)CE polytope in a lookup table for the 15 best-response-invariant embeddings. The equilibria can be calculated for any 2\u00d72 game by a) calculating the equilibrium-invariant embedding b) identifying the equivalence class the game belongs to, and c) scaling the equilibria in the lookup table according to Theorem 12.\nSummarizing and visualizing large datasets with high dimensionality is an important area of research in machine learning. Principled techniques like PCA (Hotelling, 1936; Pearson, 1901) that reduce dimensionality, while maintaining the maximum amount of information, are ubiquitous. PCA allows data to be visualized in fewer dimensions. Other less principled techniques like t-SNE (Hinton and Roweis, 2003; van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) are also a very popular tool for inspecting datasets. While the fields of statistics and machine learning have benefited from such tools for decades, game theory has lacked such analysis tools, although some attempts have been made to visualize games (Czarnecki et al., 2020; Omidshafiei et al., 2020, 2022). Large games are extremely complex: they have many possible equilibria and complicated better-response dynamics. The visualization tools in this work build on fundamental principles and could be an important first step to developing such analysis techniques for large games.\nLimitations To motivate the metric spaces and embeddings we focused on 2\u00d72 games. We derived an efficient parameterization of the 2\u00d72 equilibrium-invariant embedding, which requires only two variables. This is achieved by making an assumption: only the equilibria, or similarly, the strategic interactions (best-response dynamics), of games are important. Most solution concepts are equilibrium or best-response based and the majority of the study of games is devoted to finding these solutions. However, this assumption does have a consequence: the preference ordering of joint strategy payoffs is not necessarily maintained after equilibrium-invariant transforms. This means that equilibrium selection methods such as maximum welfare could select for different equilibria in the equilibrium-invariant embedding14. Furthermore, the narrative of games that are motivated based on the ordering of joint payoffs may unravel. For example the most studied game, Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, has dominant strategies that do not result in a welfare maximizing equilibrium. Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma is transformed to Dominant which is intuitive from an equilibrium preserving perspective, but less so from a welfare or social dilemma perspective. We stress that this is a feature of the methods described in this work. If one is only concerned with the resulting rational behaviour of players, simplifying analysis of the game to only its equilibrium-invariant embedding or best-response-invariant embedding is a valuable way of removing redundant features of games.\nThe 2\u00d72 equilibrium-invariant embedding can be leveraged to produce visualizations of larger games. Payoff structure, equilibrium properties, and other details can be read from the visualizations by observing where the point cloud spreads and how the density of points land in best-response-invariant equivalence classes. Although we provide evidence that visualizations can give an insight into how cyclic a game is, it is only capable of showing cycles of length two, longer cycles may not be captured. For example, Rock-Paper-Scissors visualized using a 2\u00d72 point cloud would only show Dominant points.\n14Although, with knowledge of the mean and scale used to make the transformation, a trivial modification to the objective of the linear program could preserve the selection\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games"

            "text": "We study payoff transforms that reduce the degrees of freedom in the space of games. This makes them a) easier to understand, b) easier to sample from, and c) easier to visualize. In this work we defined an equilibrium inspired metric-space, an equilibrium-invariant embedding, equilibrium-symmetric embedding, and better-response-invariant embedding for games. In order to explore these concepts we focused on 2\u00d72 games which are well studied in the literature. We uncovered an efficient two variable parameterization of the 2\u00d72 equilibrium-invariant embedding. These variables geometrically represent angles on unit circles which allows them to be clearly visualized in two dimensions. Several properties, including equilibrium support, cyclicness, competitiveness, distances, and symmetries, can be read from this visualization, which we explore. We applied a new equilibrium-payoff transform that enabled further simplification, and rediscovered a set of 15 equivalence classes of games. We argued this set is fundamental, and covers all interesting 2\u00d72 strategic interactions. We name and explore the properties of these classes. Finally, we develop visualization tools for 2\u00d72 and |A1 |\u00d7|A2 | normal-form games and arbitrary dimensional polymatrix games. Since all extensive-form games have a normal-form representation and a local polymatrix approximation representation, we explored visualizing the strategic space of large games that have until now been considered intractable to visualize. We hope this work builds intuition for normal-form games, champions the set of 15 2\u00d72 game classes, provides useful visualization tools for game theorists, and computational insights for game theoretic algorithm developers."

Therefore there are |A\u22121 | redundant columns. The remaining are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of |A| \u2212 |A\u22121 |. Similar construction patterns can be made for \ud835\udc47CCE\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc4e\u2032\ud835\udc5d \u2297 \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4e). Again, one block column, or |A\u2212\ud835\udc5d | are not linearly independent, so the rank is |A| \u2212 |A\u22121 |.\nEquilibrium-Invariant Embedding, Metric Space, and Fundamental Set of 2\u00d72 Normal-Form Games"
