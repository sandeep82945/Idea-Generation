In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that in a single-atom maser based on a transmon strongly coupled to two resonators it is possible to pump over a dozen of photons into the system. The first high-quality resonator plays a role of usual lasing cavity, and the second one presents a controlled dissipation channel, bolstering population inversion, and modifies the energy level structure to lift the blockade. As a confirmation of lasing action, we observe conventional laser features such as the narrowing of emission linewidth and external signal amplification. Additionally, we report unique single-atom features: self-quenching and several lasing thresholds.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nExperimental studies on single-atom lasers and masers are following the recent developments in quantum optics of individual quantum systems [1]. Trapped atoms/ions [2, 3], superconducting artificial atoms [4\u20136], semiconductor double quantum dots [7\u20139], biased Josephson junctions [10] have already been used as a single-atom gain medium and allowed experimental investigation of non-conventional properties of these lasers such as multistability, emission of squeezed radiation, self-quenching, etc. Recently, there was a theoretical proposal [11] regarding a superconducting circuit QED [12] maser consisting of a magnetic-flux-tunable Xmon-type transmon [13] coupled to two microwave resonators: a highQ reservoir to accumulate microwave photons, and a low-Q auxiliary one. The latter cavity forms an engineered dissipative environment enforcing metastability of the second excited transmon state. Besides bolstering the population inversion, it also significantly modifies the maser energy level structure and allows it to overcome the photon blockade limiting the intensity of the emitted radiation in coherently-pumped systems with strong coupling [14, 15]. Physical realization of the proposed device would allow one to study those its properties that cannot be explored in numerical simulations, for example the spectrum of the emitted radiation which is hard to compute [16]. Additionally, we expect that suggested architecture will be suitable for novel quantum devices, for example, coherent quantum phonon emitters, which have a wide range of both scientific and practical applications [17]. In this paper, we describe our implementation of the suggested architecture and present main results confirming the lasing action of the device.\n\u2217 gleb.fedorov@phystech.edu\nII. DEVICE\nIn Fig. 1(a), we reproduce the conceptual schematic of the device from the proposal [11].

The cavities are designed to have coupling strengths gr,a and leakage rates \u03bar,a. The design values for these parameters have been optimized for maximal steadystate reservoir population Nss [11]. The relevant GKSL master equation is based on the collapse operators\u221a\u03bar,aar,a,\u221a\u03b3b for the relaxation of the cavities and the transmon and \u221a\u03b3\u03c6b\u2020b for transmon pure dephasing. For comparison between the design parameters and the parameters found experimentally in this work, along with the brief description of their meaning, see Table I. The transmon frequency is maximal for zero external flux through its SQUID loop (around 5.95 GHz) and can be tuned down in frequency into resonance consecutively with the reservoir and auxiliary cavity:\nfge(\u03a6e) \u2248 fmaxge \u221a cos(\u03c0\u03a6e/\u03a60), (5)\nwhere \u03a6e/\u03a60 is the ratio of the external flux through the SQUID to the magnetic flux quantum. There is a slight discrepancy between the anharmonicity of the transmon and the frequency difference between the cavities (180 MHz vs. 145 MHz), and appreciable deviations in \u03baa and ga from design\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n05 16\n5v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 2\nSe p\n20 22\n2 60\n(d)\nCirculator\nDC-coil\n20 20\n40\nVNA SA\nCurrent source\nMW source\n(e)\n15 mKrelaxation\nPump line\nFIG. 1. (a) A scheme showing the configuration of the energy levels when the reservoir is resonant with the |g\u3009 \u2194 |e\u3009 transition, and the auxiliary cavity is resonant with the |e\u3009 \u2194 |f\u3009 transition. (b) Schematic of the circuit QED implementation of the system. To the left is the auxiliary and to the right is the reservoir cavity, implemented as halfwave transmission line (coplanar waveguide) resonators. Capacitors Cr,ag couple transmon with the reservoir, auxiliary cavity; Cr,a\u03ba define desired external quality factors. (c) Design of the device (photo-lithography layer) and optical images of the cavity coupling capacitors. Microwave antenna routing the pump signal towards the transmon comes from the right side of the sample. The colors of the elements correspond to the colors on (a) and (b). (d) SEM image of the transmon coupled to the cavities; in the inset, the SQUID area is shown with higher magnification. (e) Scheme of measurement: sample as in (c) is wirebonded, refrigerated to 15 mK, input signals come through attenuated coaxial lines, and output line contains an amplifier chain with a HEMT amplifier. By one switch one chooses whether to measure reflection off auxiliary or reservoir resonator, and by another signal analyzer (SA) and vector network analyzer (VNA) are exchanged; an external solenoid supplies DC magnetic field to the SQUID.\nvalues. This mismatch does not critically affect the functioning of the device by virtue of general robustness of the optimal Nss to parameter perturbations for large values of \u03baa. Another difference is the non-negligible internal loss of the reservoir cavity which we estimate from the fit to be \u03bair = \u03bar \u2212 \u03baer = 0.39 \u00b5s\u22121 in the worst case (see Supplementary Materials). As Nss in the simple model is inversely proportional to total reservoir loss [11], and as the internal loss in our case approximately equals the external, one can expect halving of the device maximum emission intensity compared to the ideal case. We take \u03baer into account when calculating the Nss from measured signal power. Finally, we note that the proper relaxation and coherence times of the transmon were not measured directly due to the limitations of the experimental setup; one can expect its relaxation rate to be lower than \u03bair due to a lower interface participation ratio [18], while the dephasing can be neglected as the system functions in the mixed state [11].\nThe electrical scheme of the device and the design for nanofabrication are shown in Fig. 1(b,c). The couplings and dissipation rates are physically determined by the capacitances Ca,r\u03ba,g which are small enough to be produced in a single Al layer. However, as they break the ground plane, we also use air-bridges to ensure the uniformity of ground electric potential. In Fig. 1(d) we show a SEM image of the Xmon along\nwith its SQUID in the inset (see Supplementary Materials for fabrication details).\n3 III. REFLECTION AND EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY\nWe begin the study of the system by performing reflection spectroscopy of the reservoir resonator when the transmon is tuned into resonance with it, see Fig. 2(a). The vector network analyzer (VNA) measuring the complex reflection parameter S11 is set at a low power near the single-photon regime for the reservoir cavity (frequency sweep range of the VNA is shown on the y-axis). While performing spectroscopy, we send an additional signal at fp = fgf/2 = 5.788 GHz to the pump line using a separate microwave source. Its power is shown on the x-axis. When its power is off or very low, two transitions of the avoided crossing |0a, g, 0r\u3009 \u2192 (|0a, g, 1r\u3009 \u00b1 |0a, e, 0r\u3009)/ \u221a 2 are visible at 5.854 and 5.876 GHz, from what gr/2\u03c0 = 11 MHz (see Supplementary Materials). When the two-photon pumping power is increased, these transitions become Stark-shifted upwards and saturate. They completely disappear at around -10 dBm level of the microwave source, which is the beginning of the lasing action. The |S11| characteristic of the remaining spectral line is not a Lorentzian dip above this power but shows small amplification \u2013 manifestation of the injection locking effect [19]. Also, above -10 dBm the reservoir begins to emit power (Fig. 2(b)) which can be detected upon disconnecting the VNA from the measurement setup and connecting a signal analyzer (SA) to the output line.\nPrecise calibration of the emission power is difficult due to the uncertainty of the amplification level in the output line. We find it by using the fact that the vacuum Rabi splitting can be regarded as an effective two-level system, for which calibration of absolute input power is feasible [20, 21]. First, we measure the saturation of the avoided crossing peaks with increase of VNA power PVNA and compare the data with numerical simulation for the extracted system parameters; this allows us to find the driving amplitude, and thus the absolute signal power Pc.p. at the reservoir coupling port for a given PVNA. Next, we measure the power of a slightly off-resonant reflected and amplified signal PSA by the SA assuming almost unity reflection off the coupling port in the vicinity of the resonance. Finally, calculate the amplification level a = PSA/Pc.p. in the output line (see details in the Supplementary Materials). When the amplification is known, the total emission power at the coupling port can be calculated as an integral of the signal power spectral density SV V (f) measured by the signal analyzer as\nP = \u03baerNss~\u03c9 = 1\na\n\u222b\nBW SV V (f) df, (6)\nwhere BW stands for the bandwidth where the emission signal is non-negligible. For this value, we take the span of the SA shown in the y-axis of Fig. 2(b). We plot the calibrated Nss vs. pumping power in Fig. 2(c) and confirm that it is indeed possible to achieve significant reservoir population using our architecture: in the range between 5 and 10 dBm of pumping power, reservoir accumulates nearly 20 photons. According to the model described in the proposal and generalized to the case of non-zero detuning between the transitions g \u2192 e and |0\u3009a \u2192 |1\u3009a, for experimental parameters the system should\n5.8595 5.8597 5.8599 5.8601 Frequency (GHz)\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nPo we\nr ( pW\n)\n(d) Lasing spectrum Lorentzian with r/Nss Resonator\n5.85\n5.86\n5.87\n5.88\nFr eq\n.

The orange line shows 1\u2212 |S11| when the transmon is far detuned, and the blue line is the lasing spectrum at 10 dBm pumping power. The central frequency of the latter is 200 kHz lower than fr, which may be explained by the fact that frequencies of the transitions between high energy levels are not equal to fr due to strong coupling [11]. For high reservoir population, the line of the emission spectrum is significantly narrower than the resonator proper amplitude characteristic: the FWHM is 26 kHz vs. 61 kHz for Nss = 3.9, and approaches the Schawlow-Towneslimited spectrum with a width of \u03bar/2\u03c0Nss = 16 kHz.\nAs an additional test for the laser action of the device, we show that an external microwave signal is amplified upon reflection off the reservoir cavity when the system is pumped above the first threshold. The results are presented in Fig. 3 for three different pumping powers: -5 dBm (a), 5 dBm (b) and 10 dBm (c). The reference level is depicted by a horizontal black line, and the dip in the data trace means resonant absorption of radiation, while the peak reveals amplification. Amplification depends non-linearly on the pumping power, with a maximum amplitude gain of G = 3.6 at 5 dBm pumping power. In Fig. 3(d), one can see how the amplification saturates with increased VNA power for the three values of pumping power, which is a typical behavior [19]. We also observe that in Fig. 3(a) the amplification area is located slightly below resonance, while in Fig. 3(b-c) it is slightly above. Based on the data shown in Fig. 2(a), we find that the transition between these regimes occurs at 0 dBm of pumping power, and it coincides with the second lasing threshold in Fig. 2(c); the nature of this effect remains unclear to us.\nIn order to quantify the device action outside the optimal regime and better understand the lasing mechanism, we also study the dependence of the emission spectrum on the external flux in the SQUID and the pumping frequency. We now use lower-power pumping (-5 dBm) to avoid power broadening and achieve better resolution of transitions. Fig. 4(a) shows scan of two symmetric avoided crossings with green lines marking the points where the transmon ge transition is resonant with the reservoir, and yellow lines \u2013 where the ge transition is resonant with the pump signal. The first configuration was studied before in Fig. 1(a), and in the second one the qubit may be pumped directly. As can be seen in Fig. 4(b) and (c), the reservoir population is the highest in proximity to the green lines, both in the experiment and the simulation. Nevertheless, we note that emission is observed for a wider frequency range in the experiment than in the simulation. A small dip in Nss which coincides with the central points of the avoided crossings can be explained by the fact that low-power pumping cannot overcome the photon blockade, being under the lasing threshold [11].\nSimilarly, we measure the dependence of the emission spectrum on the pumping frequency for the resonant configuration. The results are shown in Fig. 4(d). Since there is a 35 MHz detuning between fr + fa and fgf when fge = fr, we mark two competing cases of two-photon pumping: the magenta vertical line corresponds to the resonance with the transition from the ground state to |1a, e, 0r\u3009 (this is the con-\n5.860 5.862 Freq.

Besides, based on theoretical studies we assume that our system should exhibit such features as bistability of Wigner function and sub-Poissonian statistics of emitted radiation [11].\nAs this was the first experimental study of this kind of a device, we have also investigated in more detail the conventional manifestations of the lasing effect to confirm its nature. Firstly, we have demonstrated that the emission linewidth is narrower then the resonator proper linewidth and, notably, approaches the Schawlow-Townes limit for certain regimes. Secondly, if supplied, an external microwave signal is being amplified by the device; this effect was previously demonstrated for single-atom masers [4] as well as in ordinary lasers and is caused by injection-locking effect [19]. Finally, we measured the emission spectrum depending on transmon frequency and pumping frequency and observed that lasing manifests itself when the system parameters are close to the theoretically predicted, which is a strong evidence of the correctness of our model.\nV.

Using (3), we find that line attenuation A = PVNA/Pc.p. = 102.8. We check that this value adds up well from the\napproximately 70 dB in the attenuators inside the refrigerator, 20 dB in the directional coupler that\nwas used for two-tone spectroscopy and 10 dB of loss in the cables.\nConsequently, if the input power is -40 dBm, then Pc.p. = \u2212142.8 dBm. Knowing this fact, we can find the amplification G of output line. To do it, we set input power to -40 dBm, frequency\nto 5.9 GHz (to be not very far from working frequency) and measure the reflected power by\nspectrum analyzer, assuming that reflected power outside the resonance is almost equal to Pc.p..\nThe measured power is 78.8 dBm, which means that G = 78.8 \u2212 (\u2212142.8) = 64 dBm.

IV of the theoretical proposal [2] has to be modified. Precisely, we again need to solve the GKSL master equation, but now with a non-zero\ndetuning included into the Hamiltonian:\nH\u0302t-a/~ = ga(ba\u2020a + b\u2020aa) + \u03b4b\u2020b, (4)\nwhere aa is truncated to two lowest levels and b to two levels e and f (meaning that the effective coupling constant should be changed to g = ga \u221a 2). For this calculation, the dissipative part in the master equation contains only the collapse operator \u221a \u03baaaa. We find that solving the resulting\nODE system is easier in the real-number representation of the density matrix. If the correspond-\ning transformation is done as \u03c1r = T \u03c1 with some superoperator T , then the GKSL equation is transformed to\n\u03c1\u0307r = Lr\u03c1r, (5)\nwhere Lr = T LT \u22121 is also real. Finding the effective decay rate \u03b3effef of the ef -transition (\u03baeffa in the notation of [2]) is now equivalent to finding the slowest-decaying non-oscillating exponent in\n7\nthe solution. The relevant eigenvalue of L turns out to be\n\u03bb = \u2212\u03b3effef = \u2212 \u03baa 2\n+ \u221a \u03b32 + 2g2\u03b4 ,\n\u03b32 = \u03baa\n2\n8 \u2212 \u03b4\n2\n2 \u2212 2 g2,\ng2\u03b4 =\n\u221a[ \u03b42\n4 + ( g + \u03baa 4 )2] [\u03b42 4 + ( g \u2212 \u03baa 4 )2] .\n(6)\nFor the experimental parameters g/2\u03c0 = 21.9 MHz, \u03ba = 90 \u00b5s\u22121, \u03b4/2\u03c0 = 35 MHz, we find\n\u03b32 \u2248 \u221261.1 \u00b7 103 \u00b5s\u22122, g2\u03b4 \u2248 30.9 \u00b7 103 \u00b5s\u22122 and \u03b3effef \u2248 17 \u00b5s\u22121. One can compare this value with the resonant under-damped case where \u03b3effef = \u03baa/2 = 45 \u00b5s \u22121 [2].\nAnother way to calculate \u03b3effef is to find the steady state solution of the master equation with an\naddition of a weak incoherent excitation |e\u3009 \u2192 |f\u3009 at rate \u0393\u0303.

In the steady state, the balance condition \u03b3effef \u2329 \u03c3+ef\u03c3 \u2212 ef \u232a ss = \u03baa \u2329 a\u2020aaa \u232a ss is satisfied,\nmeaning that the rate of qubit population leakage must be equal to the rate of the cavity population\nleakage, since there is no other dissipation channel for the former. In the limit of \u0393\u0303 \u2192 0 and \u03b1\u2192 0 we obtain\n\u03b3effef = \u03baa \u2329 a\u2020aaa \u232a ss\u2329\n\u03c3+ef\u03c3 \u2212 ef \u232a ss\n\u2248 4 g 2\u03baa\n4 \u03b42 + 4 g2 + \u03ba2a .

The comparison between the numerical solution, (6), and (9) is shown in S. 5 in log-scale; one can see that (9) predicts higher decay rate compared to the time-dependent\nsolution though being closer to the numerical result in terms of RMS distance.\nNext, we estimate the effective pumping rate from |g\u3009 \u2192 |e\u3009when the two-photon ef transition Rabi frequency is \u21262ph. Compared to the proposal, the experimental value of \u03b3effef is now closer to\nthe estimated \u21262ph so that the strong-coupling case \u03b3effef < 2\u21262ph may be reached. That means that\nthe pumping rate \u0393 = \u03b3effef /2 \u2248 8.5 \u00b5s\u22121 by (6) or even 12.5 \u00b5s\u22121 by (9), compared to 5.3 \u00b5s\u22121\ncalculated before for the optimal parameters in the resonant case [2]. One can see that non-zero\ndetuning does not deteriorate the effective pumping rate if compensated by the strong coupling\nregime of the two-photon pump.\nFinally, we estimate the resulting expected population of the reservoirNss. The strong coupling condition 4 \u221a Ngr > N\u03bar is met for \u03bar = 0.69 \u00b5s\u22121, gr/2\u03c0 = 11 MHz for N < 360, so the\nexpected population for the more modest \u0393 value predicted by (6) is\nNss = 2 \u0393\n\u03bar \u2248 24.

To improve\nthe interface between the substrate and the ground metal we remove the native oxide by dipping\nthe silicon wafer in piranha solution and buffered HF [6, 7] before aluminum evaporation. To ob-\ntain a good galvanic contact between the transmon qubit and the ground plane, it is further shorted\nby additional aluminum bandage layer [8]. We also implement aluminum air-bridges on the top of\nthe coplanar transmission lines [9].\n[1] S. Probst, F. B. Song, P. A. Bushev, A. V. Ustinov, and M.
