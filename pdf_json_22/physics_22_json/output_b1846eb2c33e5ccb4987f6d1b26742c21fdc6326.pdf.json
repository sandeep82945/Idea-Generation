    "abstractText": "Wetting phenomena in a lattice model of particles having two chemically different halves (A and B) and being in contact with solid substrates have been studied with Monte Carlo methods. The energy of the interaction between a pair of neighboring particles has been assumed to depend on the degree to which the AA, AB and BB regions face each other. In this work, we have assumed that uAA = \u22121.0 and considered three series of systems with uAB = uBB, uAB = 0 and uBB = 0. The phase behavior of bulk systems has been determined. In particular, it has been shown that at sufficiently low temperatures the bulk systems order into the superantiferromagnetic (SAF) phase, or into the antiferromagnetic (AF) phase, depending on the magnitudes of AA, AB and BB interaction energies, uAA, uAB and uBB. The SAF structure occurs whenever e = uAA + uBB \u2212 2uAB is lower than zero and the AF structure is stable when e is greater than zero. The wetting behavior has been demonstrated to depend strongly on the structure of the bulk condensed phase, the interactions between fluid particles and the strength of the surface potential. In all series, we have found the dewetting transition, resulting from the limited stability of different ordered structures of surface phases. However, in the systems that exhibit the gas\u2013liquid transition in the bulk, the reentrant wetting transition has been observed at sufficiently high temperatures. The mechanism of dewetting and reentrant wetting transitions has been determined. Moreover, we have also demonstrated, how the dewetting transition in the series with uAB = 0 is affected by the wall selectivity, i.e., when the interaction between the parts A and B of fluid particles and the solid is different.",

In general, there are three main scenarios of molecular film growth on solid substrates [9], usually termed Frank\u2013van der Merwe (type-1), Stranski\u2013Krastanov (type-2) and Volmer\u2013Weber (type-3) growth modes [10]. In the type-1 growth, the films grow asymptotically toward the infinite thickness, when the pressure approaches the bulk coexistence. In the case of type-2 growth, the films reach the finite thickness, usually limited to only a few molecular layers. This situation is referred to as the incomplete or partial wetting. Finally, when the film exhibits type-3 growth mode, the adsorption remains very small at any pressure, up to the bulk coexistence, and it corresponds to nonwetting. Complete wetting requires the adsorbate\u2013substrate interaction to be sufficiently strong, and when it dominates over the adsorbate\u2013adsorbate interaction, complete wetting may occur at any temperature, even at T = 0 [2,3,6,7,9]. However, the adsorbed films may grow in different ways at low and high temperatures. At low temperatures, the film thickness usually increases in a step-wise manner, via a series of first-order layering transitions [6,7,9]. Every layering transition may lead to the condensation of a single molecular layer or it may involve a simultaneous condensation of a certain number of molecular layers, depending\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 12802. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232112802 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\non the magnitudes of the adsorbate\u2013adsorbate and the adsorbate\u2013substrate interaction energies and the temperature [9,16]. In any case, each layering transition terminates in the respective critical point, Tc(n) [6,9], with n being the layer number and Tc(n) converges to the roughening temperature, TR [17], when n goes to infinity. At the temperatures above TR, the interface between the adsorbed film and the bulk strongly fluctuates and hence the film thickness increases continuously and ultimately diverges at the bulk coexistence. When the strength of surface potential is lowered below a certain threshold value, complete wetting may occur only at finite temperatures, starting at the wetting temperature Tw [4,6,9]. Below Tw, the film thickness remains finite at any pressure up to the bulk coexistence and hence such systems show type-2 or type-3 growth. The actual mode of the film development is controlled by the relation between the wetting and roughening temperatures [6,9]. As long as Tw < TR, the interface between the film and the bulk phase is sharp and layering transitions may still occur, but only at temperatures between Tw and TR. On the other hand, when Tw > TR, the film develops differently. Instead of layering transitions, it usually exhibits the prewetting, or the thinthick film, transition, before the wetting transition at the bulk coexistence. In such cases, the wetting is the first order transition [3]. A further weakening of the substrate potential has been predicted [3,9,18] to lead to the continuous wetting transition (critical wetting) at the bulk coexistence. Ultimately, when the surface potential becomes weak enough, only incomplete wetting (type-2) or non-wetting (type-3) behavior occurs at any temperature. The experimental studies of wetting of simple gases on graphite [19] demonstrated that the relative strength of adsorbate\u2013adsorbate and adsorbate\u2013substrate interactions is not the sole factor that determines the wetting behavior. It was demonstrated, however, that at sufficiently low temperatures, the type-1 growth occurs over a certain range of relative strength of the adsorbate\u2013adsorbate and adsorbate\u2013substrate interactions. The type-2 behavior was found to occur for both sufficiently weak and sufficiently strong surface potentials. It was shown [20\u201322] that the reentrant type-2 growth may result from a mismatch between the lattices of the solid-like film and the bulk solid phase. Another frequently observed phenomenon is triple point wetting [23,24], which occurs when the solid phase does not wet the surface while the liquid phase does. There are several possible scenarios of wetting close to the bulk triple point [8], depending on the wetting properties of the solid and liquid bulk phases, as well as the structure of the interface between the surface and bulk phases. On the other hand, it was theoretically predicted by Cahn [25] and by Saam and Ebner [26] that complete wetting should occur at temperatures below the bulk critical temperature. This is so because the surface tension goes to zero at temperatures lower than the bulk critical temperature, and hence complete wetting should occur. Another theoretically predicted and observed experimental phenomenon is reentrant wetting [8,27\u201334]. It occurs when the adsorbed film and/or the bulk condensed phase change their structure when the temperature changes. In the recent paper [35], we presented a rather simple lattice gas model of particles with orientation-dependent interactions in contact with a solid substrate. The discussion was limited to the systems with the adsorbate\u2013adsorbate interaction characteristic of Januslike particles [36], composed of the two halves, A and B. The energy of AA interaction was assumed to be attractive and fixed (uAA = \u22121.0), the energy of the AB interaction was set to zero, while the BB interaction was assumed to be non-repulsive. The grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo simulation, performed for the particular system with uAB = uBB = 0, showed that complete wetting occurs at low temperatures, even for very weakly adsorbing surfaces. In this work, we applied the same lattice model, but for a wider range of parameters representing the interaction energies between the particles. Three series of systems with uAB = uBB, with uAB = 0 and with uBB = 0 have been considered. It has been shown that depending on the assumed interactions between the particles, the bulk systems order into the superantiferromagnetic (SAF) or into the antiferromagnetic (AF) phases at low temperatures and at sufficiently high densities, leading to the different topologies of the\nbulk phase diagrams. The knowledge of the bulk phase behavior is a necessary prerequisite for the study of wetting phenomena on solid surfaces. Our study of wetting has shown that the orientation-dependent interactions may lead to the dewetting and the reentrant wetting transitions in the systems characterized by different interparticle interactions and different strengths of the surface potential. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly recall basic information about the model used and the applied Monte Carlo method. A detailed description of the model has been already given in [35]. In Section 3, we discuss the bulk behavior of the model and demonstrate how the assumed interactions between the particles affect the topology of bulk phase diagrams. Then, in Section 4 we discuss the wetting behavior of the already specified three series of systems. This section is divided into two subsections, in which the systems order into the SAF and AF structures in the bulk. Section 5 describes the results of calculations for an idealized model, which demonstrates how the stability of the ordered SAF and AF multilayer films influences the wetting behavior of different systems. The paper is concluded in Section 6, in which we summarize our findings."

            "text": "The model used here is essentially the same as described in earlier work [35]. Thus, we consider the particles composed of the two halves, A and B, on a regular cubic lattice and with the interactions limited to the first nearest neighbor. Each particle is assumed to take on one of the six orientations, marked by the parameter k = 1, 2, . . . 6 (see Figure 1), and the energy of an interaction between a pair of neighboring particles is equal to\nu(ki, k j,~rij) = wAA(ki, k j,~rij)uAA + wAB(ki, k j,~rij)uAB + wBB(ki, k j,~rij)uBB (1)\nIn the above, uAA, uAB and uBB are the interaction energies corresponding to the relative orientations in which the AA, AB or BB halves face one another, while wAA(ki, k j,~rij), wAB(ki, k j,~rij) and wBB(ki, k j,~rij) are the weights determined by the degrees to which the AA, AB and BB regions overlap and~rij is the separation vector. In the case of the cubic lattice, the separation vectors are: ~rij = (\u00b11, 0, 0), (0,\u00b11, 0) and (0, 0,\u00b11) and there are seven different values of u(ki, k j,~rij) (cf. Table 1 of [35]).\nSuch a lattice fluid is in contact with a solid substrate and the fluid\u2013substrate interaction is described by the potential V(z, k), which depends on the distance from the surface, z. When the parts A and B interact differently with the solid substrate, the surface is selective, and the surface potential depends also on the orientation k of the fluid particle. Here, we assume that V(z, k) has the following form:\nV(z, k) = { Vo,k z3 , z \u2264 zcut\n0, z > zcut (2)\nwith\nVo,k =  0.5(VA + VB), k = 1, 2, 3, 4 VA, k = 5 VB, k = 6\n(3)\nIn the above, VA and VB represent the fluid\u2013solid interaction energies when the particle in the first layer assumes the orientation with its A or B side directed towards the surface (see the right part of Figure 1) and the cut-off distance zcut has been set at z = 15. Since the model has been studied with the Monte Carlo simulation method in the grand canonical ensemble [37,38], only finite systems could be treated. Here we considered systems consisting of DL2 sites, arranged in D layers of L2 sites each. The Hamiltonian of the model reads\nH = \u2211 \u3008i,j\u3009\nu(ki, k j,~rij)ninj + D\n\u2211 l=1 \u2211 i\u2208l\nV(l, ki)ni \u2212 \u00b5 DL2\n\u2211 i=1 ni (4)\nwhere ni = 1 or 0, when the i-th site is occupied or empty. The first term represents the total energy of the fluid\u2013fluid interaction, with the sum running over all distinct pairs of nearest neighbors, the second term gives the energy of the interaction between the fluid particles and the solid, and \u00b5 is the chemical potential. To study bulk systems, we have mostly used the simulation cells of the size with L = D = 20, the periodic boundary conditions applied in all three directions. In some cases, the larger simulation cells with L = D = 30 and 40 have been used to see if the finite size effects influence the results. The quantities recorded included the total density\n\u03c1b = 1\nDL2 \u3008\nDL2 \u2211 i=1 ni\u3009 , (5)\nthe densities of differently oriented particles\n\u03c1b,k = 1\nDL2 \u3008\nDL2 \u2211 i=1 ni\u03b4(ki \u2212 k)\u3009 , (6)\nthe average potential energy per site\n\u3008u\u3009 = 1 DL2 \u3008\u2211 \u3008ij\u3009 ninju(ki, k j,~rij)\u3009 , (7)\nthe heat capacity\nCV = 1\nT2 [\u3008H2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008H\u30092] , (8)\nwhereH = H/DL2, and the density susceptibility\n\u03c7\u03c1 = 1 T [\u3008\u03c12b\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03c1b\u3009 2] . (9)\nTo obtain reliable results at any state point, specified by the temperature and the chemical potential, we performed runs involving 106\u2013107 Monte Carlo steps to equilibrate the system, and another 106\u2013107 Monte Carlo steps have been used to calculate averages. Each Monte Carlo step consisted of DL2 attempts to either create a randomly oriented particle at an also randomly chosen position, or to annihilate one of the randomly chosen particles. In order to study nonuniform systems, the simulation cell has been assumed to be a slab of fixed width equal to D = 80 and with the solid surfaces located at the bottom (z = 0) and at the top (z = D + 1) of the slab. The linear dimension of each layer was set to L = 40, with standard periodic boundary conditions applied to each layer.\nThe recorded quantities included the local densities of differently oriented particles,\n\u03c1k(l) = L\u22122\u3008\u2211 i\u2208l ni\u03b4(ki \u2212 k)\u3009 , (10)\nwhich allowed calculating the total local density\n\u03c1(l) = 6\n\u2211 k=1 \u03c1k(l) , (11)\nthe surface excess density\n\u03c1ex = 1 2\nD\n\u2211 l=1 (\u03c1(l)\u2212 \u03c1b) , (12)\nand the surface excesses of differently oriented particles\n\u03c1ex(k) = 1 2\nD\n\u2211 l=1 (\u03c1k(l)\u2212 \u03c1b,k) . (13)\nThe values of \u03c1b and \u03c1b,k were obtained by averaging the local densities over the inner layers, with l between 21 and 60. We also calculated the layer energies (per unit surface area), u(l), which were used to calculate the surface excess energy\nuex = 1 2\nD\n\u2211 l=1 (ul \u2212 ub) , (14)\nwhere ub is the bulk energy (per site), calculated as\nub = 1\n40\n60 \u2211 21 ul . (15)\nOne should note that at the low temperatures, the density fluctuations in the bulk phase are considerably smaller than in the surface region. The significant fluctuations in the bulk phase occur only at temperatures close to the critical point. Taking this into account, we used the preferential sampling of the surface region [16,39] to reduce the CPU time. Namely, the first 10 layers and the following 5 layers, adjacent to the surfaces, were sampled 10 and 5 times more frequently than the remaining inner part of the system. Throughout this work, we have assumed that uAA = \u22121.0 is the unit of energy and hence the energy, temperature and chemical potential were expressed in the reduced units of |uAA|. We considered three series of systems, assuming that all interactions are attractive. The first series comprised of systems where uAB = 0 and uBB was varied. In the second series, we assumed that uAB = uBB = u\u2217, and considered different values of u\u2217. Finally, in the third series, uBB was set to 0 and uAB was allowed to vary. The vast majority of results were obtained for non-selective surfaces, i.e., with VA = VB. However, we also considered the wetting behavior at selective surfaces, with the positive and negative values of \u2206V = VA \u2212VB."

            "text": "The bulk properties of the series with uAB = 0 and uBB \u2208 [0,\u22121] have already been discussed in [35]. All such systems undergo one first-order transition between the disordered fluid and the orientationally ordered high-density phase at any temperature between zero and the temperature To(uBB). At To(uBB), the systems of the density \u03c1 = 1.0 also undergo the first-order orientational transition between the disordered and the ordered phases. The orientationally ordered phase, of the structure given in Figure 2a exhibits the same ordering as the superantiferromagnetic (SAF) phase of the Ising model [40,41], and the transition between the SAF and paramagnetic (disordered) states is known to be discontinuous [42].\nThe phase diagrams for any uBB between 0 and \u22121.0 have the swan neck shape (cf. Figure 12 in [35]). The lack of gas\u2013liquid condensation is caused by the high stability of the orientationally ordered phase. Even in the case uBB = 0, the AA attraction is sufficient to stabilize the ordered SAF phase over a wide range of temperatures. Thus, these systems exhibit the incipient triple point, resulting from the sufficient lowering of the ordered phase free energy to exclude the presence of a disordered (liquid-like) phase. Such phase behavior was observed in several two- and three-dimensional systems. In particular, in monolayers of nitrogen and krypton on graphite [43] and in the monolayers of noble gases on lamellar dihalides [44]. In those systems, the lack of gas\u2013liquid condensation resulted from the high stability of commensurate phases formed on corrugated surfaces [4,6]. Similarly, the Lennard\u2013Lones fluids confined between crystalline walls [45,46] and non-additive symmetric mixtures [47,48] also demonstrated a lack of gas\u2013liquid condensation. The coexistence between the dilute and the condensed phases terminates at the temperature To(uBB) and \u03c1 = 1.0 and To(uBB) was found to increase linearly, when the BB attraction becomes stronger, from about 0.404 when uBB = 0, up to about 0.81 for uBB = \u22121.0. The systems with uBB = 0 and those with uAB = uBB = u\u2217, also exhibit the first-order orientational order\u2013disorder transition at \u03c1 = 1.0, but their phase behavior is qualitatively different. In the case of uBB = 0, the temperature of the orientational transition at \u03c1 = 1.0, To(uAB) linearly decreases from about 0.404, when uAB = 0, to zero, when uAB = \u22120.5 and then, also linearly, increases from zero to about 0.41, when uAB decreases further from \u22120.5 down to \u22121.0. This behavior results from the change in the structure of the orientationally ordered phase. As long as uAB > \u22120.5, the ordered phase is the SAF structure, but its stability gradually decreases when the AB attraction increases from uAB = 0 to uAB \u2212 0.5. On the other hand, for uAB < \u22120.5, the ordered high-density phase assumes the structure with only AB contacts between the nearest neighbors (see Figure 2b) and corresponds to the antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering in the Ising model [40]. In the particular case of uAB = \u22120.5, the system does not show any orientationally ordered structure. The nature of the ordered phase depends on the sign of the parameter e = uAA + uBB \u2212 2uAB. For uAB > \u22120.5, the AA and BB contacts are preferred (e < 0), while for uAB < \u22120.5, the AB contacts are preferred (e < 0), leading to the AF structure, which also undergoes the first-order orientational order\u2013disorder transition [49]. We have estimated several phase diagrams for the systems with uBB = 0 assuming different values of uAB > \u22120.5 and Figure 3 shows the examples of phase diagrams for uAB equal to\u22120.05,\u22120.1 and\u22120.2. The phase diagram for uAB = \u22120.05 is qualitatively different from those obtained for lower values of uAB and does not show the gas\u2013liquid condensation. The only transition occurs between the disordered fluid and the orientationally ordered (SAF) phases. Thus, this system shows qualitatively the same phase behavior as those with uAB = uBB (cf. Figure 12 in [35]). The weak AB attraction does not destabilize the SAF phase sufficiently to allow for the disordered liquid to appear. On the other hand, when uAB = \u22120.1 and \u22120.2, the gas\u2013liquid transition does occur over a certain range of temperatures. Only at sufficiently low temperatures, up to the triple point temperature, Ttr(uAB), does a direct gas\u2013SAF transition take place. At the temperatures above the triple point, a dilute gas phase condenses into an orientationally disordered liquid-like\nphase and the transition terminates at the critical point. The critical temperature, Tc(uAB), was found to increase when the AB attraction becomes stronger. On the other hand, the triple point temperature as well as To(uAB) both decrease when the AB attraction becomes stronger. These changes of Tc(uAB), Ttr(uAB) and To(uAB), can be readily explained by taking into account that the lowering of uAB causes the overall attraction in the system to become stronger. Since the gas and liquid phases are orientationally disordered, the critical temperature is proportional to the pair interaction energy averaged over all orientations, which is given by\nu\u0304 = 1\n36\n6\n\u2211 k1=1\n6\n\u2211 k2=1 u(k1, k2) , (16)\nand hence increases when uAB is lowered from zero to \u22121.0. In the above equation, we have dropped the dependence of the pair interaction energy u(k1, k2) on the separation vector, since u\u0304 is the same for any~rij.\nSince the stability of the SAF structure is weakened by the AB attraction, both To(uAB) and Ttr(uAB) decrease when uAB is lowered. Of course, Ttr(uAB), which has to be lower than To(uAB), gradually approaches To(uAB) when uAB decreases towards \u22120.5. When uAB < \u22120.5, the structure of the orientationally ordered dense phase changes to AF and its stability gradually increases when uAB decreases from \u22120.5 to \u22121.0. The calculations have shown the presence of gas\u2013liquid condensation for any uAB \u2208 (\u22120.5\u2212 1.0]. However, we have not been able to reliably estimate the triple point temperatures for the systems with uAB < \u22120.5. This was caused by the fact that the liquid\u2013AF transition occurs when the densities are very close to unity.\nOnly in the system with uAB = \u22121.0 have we obtained results suggesting that the triple point temperature is slightly lower than To(uAB = 1) \u2248 0.404. The calculations performed at T = 0.40 have shown that the gas condensed directly into the AF ordered phase of the density about 0.999, while at T = 0.402, the gas condensed into the disordered phase of the density about 0.996, which undergoes the transition into the ordered AF phase at the sufficiently high chemical potential. The transition is discontinuous, but with a very small density jump between about 0.9975 and 0.9985. Thus, the triple point is expected to be located at a temperature of about 0.401. When the AB attraction becomes weaker (uAB > \u22121.0), the triple point temperature is expected to be lower and closer To(uAB). The systems with uAB = uBB = u\u2217 also order into the SAF phase at low temperatures and sufficiently high densities. Their phase behavior is qualitatively the same as in the systems discussed above with uBB = 0 and uAB > \u22120.5 (see Figure 4). In particular, there is no trace of the gas\u2013liquid transition when u\u2217 = \u22120.05. It should be noted that upon the decrease of u\u2217 towards \u22121.0, the systems gradually become more and more similar to the isotropic lattice gas model. This causes the critical temperature of gas\u2013liquid transition to increase when u\u2217 decreases. Ultimately, Tc(u\u2217 = \u22121.0) reaches the value of about 1.128, characteristic of the three-dimensional cubic lattice gas model [50]. On the other hand, the triple point temperature and the temperature of orientational order\u2013disorder transition at \u03c1 = 1.0 both gradually decrease towards zero when u\u2217 approaches \u22121.0 since there is no orientational order\u2013disorder transition in the case of isotropic interactions. Figure 5 summarizes the results for bulk systems belonging to the series with uBB = 0 and with uAB = uBB, and gives the changes of To(u), Tc(u) and Ttr(u) with u when u = uAB (part a) and u = u\u2217 (part b). In both cases, the triple point temperature meets the critical point temperature of the gas\u2013liquid transition when uAB or u\u2217 become equal to about\u22120.08. For the still weaker AB and BB attraction (cf. Figures 3a and 4a) the phase diagrams become qualitatively the same as in the series with uAB = 0.0.\nWe have also included in Figure 5 the locations of critical temperatures, Tc(u\u0304), resulting from the assumption that the pair interaction energy is given by u\u0304, i.e., when the interactions are isotropic. It is evident that Tc(uAB) and Tc(u\u2217) are only slightly lower than Tc(u\u0304). These results show that close to the critical points liquid is nearly unaffected by the anisotropy of interactions."

            "text": "4.1.1. The Series with uAB = 0\nFrom the ground state considerations, it follows [35] that in the case of non-selective walls (VA = VB = Vo), all systems with uAB = 0 exhibit complete wetting at T = 0 whenever\nuBB/Vo < \u221e\n\u2211 i=1\ni\u22123 \u2248 1.20206 (17)\nThe above inequality implies that the particular system with uBB = 0 wets any attractive surface at T = 0. On the other hand, when the BB interaction becomes attractive, complete wetting occurs only for sufficiently strong surface fields. This agrees with the earlier works devoted to the wetting behavior of systems with isotropic interactions [4,6]. An increase in BB attraction leads to an overall increase in the fluid\u2013fluid attraction and hence may hinder wetting at weakly attractive substrates. When complete wetting occurs at T = 0, the film grows via a series of layering transitions and the sequence of these transitions depends on the magnitudes of uBB and Vo. In the ground state, the AB contacts are excluded for any uBB \u2264 0, and therefore only the orientations with AA and BB halves facing each other can appear. Thus, the multilayer films are predicted to have the SAF structure, just the same as the bulk condensed phase. Here, we present the examples of ground state phase diagrams for the systems with uBB = \u22121.0 and \u22120.8, since these two values of uBB were used in the study of wetting at finite temperatures. The main part of Figure 6 shows the phase diagram at T = 0 for uBB = \u22121.0. This system is rather special, since its ground state behavior is the same as in the model with isotropic interactions [9,16]. Note that only the AA and BB contacts are allowed and both are characterized by the same energy. Complete wetting occurs whenever Vo is lower than about \u22120.8319 and the films grow in a layer-by-layer manner. The first layering transition may involve a condensation of one layer, when Vo < \u22121.0/0.875 \u2248 1.14286, or a simultaneous condensation of a larger number of layers when Vo > \u22121.0/0.875 and is lower than \u22120.8319. When Vo \u2248 \u22120.8319 is approached from\nbelow, the number of simultaneously condensing layers goes to infinity and occurs right at the bulk coexistence.\nThe SAF ordering in the film can be realized when the particles in each layer are arranged in rows with alternate orientations with k = 1 and k = 3, or with k = 2 and k = 4. Moreover, the films in which the adjacent layers, i and i + 1, are filled by the particles assuming the orientation with ki = 5(6) and ki+1 = 6(5) show the SAF ordering and have the same energy. The degeneracy of the SAF structure is lifted when the BB attraction becomes weaker, i.e., when uBB > \u22121.0. The inset to Figure 6 gives the ground state phase diagram for uBB = \u22120.8. In this case, the films also grow via a sequence of layering transitions, but each transition involves a simultaneous condensation of two layers. Only when Vo < \u22121.0/0.875 foes the first layering transition lead to a monolayer, in which the SAF structure can be realized by different sets of orientations. The formation of the second layer enforces the particles in the first and second layers to assume the orientations with k1 = 6 and k2 = 5, respectively, since the energy of the interlayer interaction, equal to uAA, ensures the lowest film energy. Then, the film grows via a series of n \u2192 n + 2 transitions, with the same sequence of orientations of particles in adjacent layers (kn+1 = 6 and kn+2 = 5). Any further weakening of the BB attraction does not change this picture and causes only complete wetting to occur at also weaker surface potential, cf. Equation (17). The first series of calculations at finite temperatures was performed assuming that uBB = \u22121.0 and Vo = \u22121.0. Figure 7 presents the adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms recorded at the temperatures between 0.44 and 0.54 (part a) and between 0.55 and 0.72 (part b). At the low temperatures, up to 0.50, the films grow in a layer-by-layer mode and only the first layering transition involves a simultaneous condensation of two layers. This behavior has also been found in the model with isotropic interactions for Vo = \u22121.0 [16]. In the finite systems, like those considered here, the first-order transitions are usually accompanied by the pronounced metastability effects [38], which are manifested by the hysteresis loops on the adsorption and desorption branches of isotherms. The precise determination of transition points would require the calculation of free energies of coexisting phases [16]. Taking into account that we have been interested in qualitative behavior only, such calculations were not performed. At the temperatures of 0.52 and 0.54, the remnants of layering transitions are seen only on the desorption branches of isotherms, while the adsorption isotherms suggest the presence of a thin\u2013thick film transition. It should be also noted that the desorption isotherms at T = 0.52 and 0.54 do not show the formation of a bilayer film, but three filled layers appear before a final drop to a dilute submonolayer film. The inspection of local density profiles \u03c1k(z) demonstrated that multilayer films are\nbuilt of layers with alternate orientations kn = 6 and kn+1 = 5 characteristic of the SAF structure and suggest that the system exhibits complete wetting at temperatures up to 0.54.\nWhen the temperature exceeds 0.54, the behavior of adsorption isotherms changes completely (see Figure 7b). At temperatures between 0.55 and 0.68, the surface excess densities gradually increase, but remain rather low at the bulk coexistence. On the other hand, at still higher temperatures, the surface excess density initially grows and then gradually decays when the chemical potential approaches the bulk coexistence. This is caused by a rather high density of the bulk disordered phase close to the bulk coexistence. Figure 8 presents a series of density profiles recorded at different temperatures and at chemical potentials very close to the bulk coexistence. It is clear that at T \u2265 0.55 the local density smoothly decays towards the bulk density when the distance from the surface increases. The inset to Figure 8 demonstrates that the local densities of differently oriented particles in the film are the same for all orientations. On the other hand, the condensed bulk phase is the orientationally ordered SAF structure at temperatures up to To(uBB = \u22121) \u2248 0.81 [35]. Thus, there is a mismatch between the structures of the orientationally disordered films and the ordered bulk phase, which prevents the development of the macroscopically thick (wetting) films and suggests the presence of dewetting transition at temperature Tdw between 0.54 and 0.55. The stability of the orientationally ordered multilayer films is expected to depend on the strength of the surface potential. An increase of Vo causes a stronger pinning of the film to the surface and hence the formation of a thick orientationally ordered adsorbed layer is likely to occur over a wider range of temperatures, suggesting an increase of Tdw. Indeed, the simulations performed for different Vo, between \u22121.0 and \u22123.0, have shown that Tdw increases when the surface potential becomes stronger (see Figure 9). The observed dewetting transition marks the crossover between type-1 and type-2 wetting behaviors. At temperatures above Tdw, the adsorbed films are quite diffused and the interface between the film and bulk phase becomes broader. Therefore, estimation of the actual film thickness at high temperatures is difficult. The parameter that can be used to measure the film thickness is the average height of the film, \u3008h\u3009, defined in the same way as in the solid-on-solid model [51] by the following equation:\n\u3008h\u3009 = L\u22122\u3008 L2\n\u2211 i=1 hi\u3009 (18)\nOf course, this parameter underestimates the film thickness at high temperatures, since the film is liquid-like, while \u3008h\u3009 gives the average height of molecular piles without hang-ups. Nevertheless, it provides interesting data about the properties of adsorbed films. At any temperature above the dewetting transition, \u3008h\u3009 is expected to increase with the chemical\npotential and to reach the finite maximum value, hmax(T), at the bulk coexistence. Figure 10 gives the plots of hmax(T) obtained for the systems characterized by different values of Vo. Each set of data starts at a different temperature since the dewetting temperature increases when the surface potential becomes stronger. It can be observed that hmax(T) is practically independent of the surface potential strength, at least over the range of Vo used. This behavior can be explained by taking into account a rapid decay of the surface potential with the distance from the wall (cf. Equation (2)). An increase of the surface potential strength, from Vo = \u22121.0 to Vo = \u22123.0, influences the behavior of the adsorbed layer in the region close to the surface only. It has a negligible effect on the upper part of the film and the location of the interface between the film and the bulk. For example, at T = 0.7 the parameter hmax is equal to about 4.8 and the difference between the fluid\u2013 substrate interaction energies of particles in the fifth layer is very small when Vo = \u22123.0 and Vo = \u22121.0 and is equal to \u22120.016. Therefore, the film thickness at the bulk coexistence is primarily determined by the incompatibility between the disordered adsorbed film and the ordered bulk condensed phase and is nearly independent of the surface potential strength.\nQualitatively the same behavior was found for different uBB and Vo. Of course, the location of the dewetting transition depends on the values of uBB and Vo. For example, when uBB = \u22120.2 and Vo = \u22120.2, the dewetting transition occurs at Tdw = 0.425\u00b1 0.005, and for uBB = \u22120.8 and Vo = \u22120.8 it is located at Tdw = 0.535\u00b1 0.005. The complete wetting can not be restored at any temperature above the dewetting temperature since the bulk condensed phase remains ordered up to To(uBB) and the transition between the disordered and ordered phases is discontinuous. Therefore, the correlation length in the system is finite at any temperature, and the Cahn argument [25] cannot be used here.\nNow, we consider the changes in the wetting behavior resulting from the wall selectivity, i.e., when VA 6= VB. In such cases, the orientations of particles with their A or B halves directed toward the surface are favored when \u2206V = VA \u2212VB is negative or positive, respectively. Therefore, the structure of multilayer films is expected to depend on \u2206V and may affect wetting behavior. Here, we present explicit results for a series of systems with uBB = \u22120.8 and with different values of \u2206V, but keeping the average surface potential strength, V\u0304 = 0.5 (VA + VB) constant and equal to \u22120.8. This choice of uBB and V\u0304 ensures complete wetting in the ground state. However, the ground state phase diagram (see Figure 11) shows that there are two regions of \u2206V with different sequences of layering transitions. When \u2206V is lower than about \u22120.1, only the films with odd numbers of filled layers appear and the orientations of particles in adjacent layers are given by ki = 5 and ki+1 = 6, for any odd i. On the other hand, for \u2206V greater than about \u22120.11, and lower than about 0.533, the films with only even numbers of filled layers are formed. Each layering transition involves a simultaneous condensation of two layers, with alternate orientations ki = 6 and ki+1 = 5. Only when \u2206V becomes higher than about 0.533 does the first layering transition lead to a monolayer film, with k1 = 6, which is followed by the formation of a bilayer, with k2 = 5. The further development of multilayer film occurs via a series of the layering transitions involving a simultaneous filling of two layers, with the alternate orientations of particles in the adjacent layers characterized by ki+1 = 6 and ki+2 = 5. These changes in the ground state behavior result from the enforced changes of particle orientations in neighboring layers. Only over a very narrow range of \u2206V around \u22120.11 may odd and even numbers of occupied layers appear. We were interested in the question how wall selectivity influences the location of the expected dewetting transition. To answer this question, a series of simulations for different values of \u2206V between \u22120.34 and 0.2 were performed. The recorded density profiles of differently oriented particles (see Figure 12) confirmed that multilayer films exhibit SAF ordering at low temperatures and the orientations in subsequent layers agree with the ground state predictions. When \u2206V = 0.1 (\u2206V = \u22120.3), the orientations of neighboring layers are as follows: ki = 6(5) and ki+1 = 5(6). The stability of SAF ordering in adsorbed films and hence the dewetting temperature, is strongly affected by the wall selectivity. Figure 13 shows that the temperature of the dewetting transition reaches the minimum value for \u2206V equal to about \u22120.13, quite close to the region in which the stacking in subsequent layers changes in the ground state (cf. Figure 11). Then, Tdw increases when \u2206V becomes higher or lower than about \u22120.13 due to stronger pinning of adsorbed films to the surface. It does not matter which of the two already mentioned sequences of particle\norientations in neighboring layers appear since both lead to the SAF ordering compatible with the structure of the dense bulk phase. In consequence, the changes of Tdw are nearly symmetric around the minimum of Tdw at \u2206V \u2248 \u22120.13.\n4.1.2. The Series with uAB = uBB and the Series with uBB = 0 and uAB > \u22120.5 It has already been shown in Section 3 that the bulk systems with uAB = uBB = u\u2217 and with uBB = 0 and uAB > \u22120.5 exhibit qualitatively the same phase behavior. In particular, they order into the SAF structure at sufficiently high densities, and at temperatures up to To(u\u2217). All these systems exhibit the gas\u2013liquid transition over a certain range of temperatures and the critical temperature linearly increases when u\u2217 or uAB decreases. Moreover, the temperatures of orientational order\u2013disorder transition, To(u\u2217) and To(uAB), decrease linearly from about 0.404 to zero when u\u2217 approaches \u22121.0, or uAB approaches \u22120.5 (cf. Figure 5). From the ground state calculations, it follows that in non-uniform systems the behavior of systems with uAB = uBB = 0 and those with uBB = 0 and uAB > \u22120.5 is also qualitatively the same since the AB contacts do not appear. Thus, the formation of multilayer films usually involves n \u2192 n + 2 layering transitions. Only when Vo < \u22121/0.875 can the monolayer films appear. Then, the condensation of the second layer takes place. Further growth of the film occurs via a series of n\u2192 n + 2 transitions. Below, we present the results which demonstrate that the wetting behavior of these two series is very similar. We begin the discussion by considering the series with uAB = uBB. The majority of calculations were performed for u\u2217 = \u22120.2. The bulk system with u\u2217 = \u22120.2 is characterized by Tc(u\u2217 = \u22120.2) \u2248 0.435, To(u\u2217 = \u22120.2) \u2248 0.327 and Ttr(u\u2217 = \u22120.2) \u2248 0.316. The surface potential strength varied between \u22120.15 and \u22120.8. One should note that for this choice of u\u2217, complete wetting at T = 0 requires Vo to be lower than about \u22120.1664. Figure 14 presents the examples of adsorption isotherms obtained for Vo = \u22120.22 and at the different temperatures between 0.31 and 0.38. At temperature T = 0.31, which is lower than the bulk triple point temperature, the film grows via a sequence of n\u2192 n + 2 transitions and reaches a large thickness. The lower inset in Figure 14 shows the plots of \u03c1(z) and \u03c1k(z) recorded at T = 0.31 and the chemical potential close to the bulk coexistence. These profiles demonstrate the SAF ordering in the film and hence we conclude that complete wetting takes place. On the other hand, at T = 0.32 and 0.33, i.e., slightly above the triple point temperature, only four solid-like layers appear at the bulk coexistence and hence only partial wetting occurs. However, a further increase in temperature to 0.34 and above leads again to the development of quite thick films. The upper inset to Figure 14 gives the profiles of \u03c1(z) and \u03c1k(z) at T = 0.34, which are quite different from those recorded at T = 0.31. Only in the first few layers are the alternate orientations, with k = 6 and 5, still favored. At larger distances from the surface, all orientations become very similar, indicating that the thick films are orientationally disordered, exactly as in the bulk liquid phase. From the above results, it follows that there is a dewetting transition, which occurs right at the bulk triple point temperature, and the reentrant wetting transition at a certain temperature Trw, above the triple point, since the films and the bulk are liquid-like. One should note that at T between 0.34 and 0.36 the first-order prewetting transition appears, implying the presence of a first-order wetting transition. The temperature of the reentrant wetting transition is dominated by the stability of the orientationally ordered films since complete wetting is possible only when the adsorbed phase is orientationally disordered. It was shown in Section 4.1.1 that in the case of uAB = 0, the stability of the orientationally ordered adsorbed films increases when the surface potential becomes stronger. The results of the simulations carried out for u\u2217 = \u22120.2 and the different values of Vo have shown, however, that Trw decreases slightly from about 0.327 when Vo = \u22120.22, to T \u2248 0.322, when Vo = \u22122.0 (see Figure 15). At temperatures between Ttr and Trw, the films are rather thin and orientationally ordered, though they attain a gradually increasing thickness at the bulk coexistence when the strength of surface potential increases. For example, in the systems with Vo = \u22120.8, \u22121.0 and \u22122.0, the adsorbed films consist of four, six and eight filled layers, respectively. At temperatures above Trw, only the layers adjacent to the surface show remnants of orientational ordering, while the rest of the film\nis orientationally disordered. This is illustrated in Figure 16, which presents the local density profiles, \u03c1(z) and \u03c1k(z), recorded at the same temperature, T = 0.33, and the chemical potential \u00b5 = \u22121.272, but for different values of Vo equal to \u22121.0, \u22124.0 and \u22128.0. The film thickness increases only slightly when the surface potential becomes stronger, while its structure changes considerably and becomes increasingly similar to the bulk disordered phase, due to the suppression of the orientational ordering in the layers adjacent to the surface.\nThe wetting mode changes for the weakly attractive surface potentials with Vo > \u22120.22. Of course, complete wetting occurs at low temperatures, up to Ttr(u\u2217 = \u22120.2), but only some very dilute submonolayer films were found at temperatures between Ttr(u\u2217 = \u22120.2)\nand the temperature of the reentrant wetting transition. Figure 16 shows that the reentrant wetting temperatures for systems with Vo between \u22120.22 and \u22120.16 increase quite rapidly and rise to the bulk critical point when Vo \u2248 \u22120.155.\nThis behavior can be explained by taking into account that reentrant wetting may occur only when the growing film is orientationally disordered. In such films, all orientations are nearly equally probable and hence, the energy of the fluid\u2013fluid interaction is close to u\u0304, being equal to \u22120.4 when u\u2217 = \u22120.2. Therefore, the possibility of wetting is governed by the ratio u\u0304/Vo[9] and complete wetting at T = 0 takes place only when Vo is lower than Vo,lim \u2248 \u22120.3328. Therefore, for the surface potential with Vo > Vo,lim, complete wetting occurs at the finite temperatures only, and the wetting temperature is expected to gradually increase towards the critical point when the surface potential becomes weaker. Below the wetting temperature, the adsorbed films should remain very thin and exhibit the prewetting transition at the temperatures above the wetting temperature, in agreement with our results. The results given in Figure 15 demonstrate that for the systems with Vo > \u22120.22, the temperature of the reentrant wetting transition can be smoothly extrapolated to zero when Vo approaches Vo,lim from above. The above scenario holds for Vo < \u22120.166, since the orientationally ordered films are not stable for the weaker surface potential. Therefore, such systems do not show the triple point dewetting transition and complete wetting occurs only at sufficiently high temperatures. Now, we turn to the series with uBB = 0 and uAB > \u22120.5 and present the results obtained for the system with uAB = \u22120.2, in which Ttr(uAB = \u22120.2) \u2248 0.233, Tc(uAB = \u22120.2) \u2248 0.35 and To(uAB = \u22120.2) \u2248 0.244. We have chosen this particular system because its triple point temperature is sufficiently high to allow for efficient use of Monte Carlo simulation. Despite some rather large metastability effects, we were able to observe the layering transitions leading to the thick orientationally ordered films at the temperatures below the triple point. Some orientationally ordered films have also been observed over a certain range of temperatures above the triple point, but with the thickness limited to a few occupied layers only. At the still higher temperatures, but below the bulk critical point, the films were found to lose the orientational ordering and the thick adsorbed layers were observed to develop again. Thus, there is a dewetting transition at the triple point and a reentrant wetting transition above the triple point. The results of the calculations carried out for the different values of Vo are summarized in Figure 17 and show qualitatively the same behavior as in the series with uAB = uBB (cf. Figure 15). In particular, for Vo lower than about \u22120.16, the temperature of the reentrant wetting transition gradually decays when the surface potential becomes stronger. Surprisingly, the temperature of the reentrant wetting transition exceeds To(uAB = \u22120.2), unlike in the systems with uAB = uBB. In general, the stability of the orientationally ordered films in the systems with uBB = 0 is lower than in the systems with uAB = uBB due to the lack of BB attraction. This is reflected by the considerably lower triple point and the orientational order\u2013disorder transition temperatures in the series with uBB = 0. It should\nbe noted, however, that the reentrant wetting temperatures in the system with uBB = 0.0 and uAB = \u22120.2 are considerably lower than in the case of u\u2217 = \u22120.2.\nIn the region of weak surface potentials, with Vo > \u22120.16, the wetting behavior is governed by the ratio u\u0304/Vo and hence the temperature of rewetting transition increases quite rapidly and approaches the bulk critical point for Vo \u2248 \u22120.104. Again, the results are qualitatively quite similar to those obtained for u\u2217 = \u22120.2 (cf. Figure 15)."

            "text": "Finally, we turn to the systems with uAB < \u22120.5, which order into the AF phase in the bulk. In the ground state, the adsorbed films also order into the AF structure and the adsorbed films grow in a layer-by-layer mode. Of course, the first layering transition may involve a simultaneous condensation of a larger number of layers when the strength of surface potential is reduced. At T = 0, complete wetting occurs whenever\nuAB Vo < \u221e \u2211 i=1 i\u22123 \u2248 1.20206. (19)\nWe have already shown that the bulk triple point temperature Ttr(uAB) increases when the strength of the AB attraction increases and is only slightly lower than the orientational order\u2013disorder transition temperature in the close-packed system, To(uAB). In particular, when uAB = \u22121.0, we found that Ttr(uAB = \u22121.0) \u2248 0.4 and To(uAB = \u22121.0) \u2248 0.41. The critical temperature of the gas\u2013liquid transition in this system is equal to Tc(uAB = \u22121.0) \u2248 0.833. The adsorption isotherms recorded for the system with uAB = \u22121.0 (see Figure 18) have shown the formation of the thick films via a series of the n\u2192 n+ 1 layering transitions, at temperatures lower than 0.37. Then, at temperatures between 0.37 and 0.39, the adsorbed films of only finite thickness appear (see the inset to Figure 18). At the temperatures above the bulk triple point, the adsorbed films still grow in a layer-by-layer mode, and attain large thickness, as shown by the isotherm at T = 0.42. A sudden drop of the film thickness close to the bulk coexistence occurring at the temperatures between 0.36 and 0.37 is a consequence of the structural changes in adsorbed films. Figure 19 presents the local density profiles, \u03c1(z) and \u03c1k(z), for multilayer film, recorded at T = 0.36 (part a), at T = 0.39 (part b) and at T = 0.42 (part c).\nThe profiles at T = 0.36 show a quite well developed AF structure in the film, in which the particles predominantly assume orientations with k = 5 and 6 in every layer. On the other hand, at T = 0.39, the film consisting of six occupied layers is orientationally disordered and quite similar behavior has been observed at T = 0.37 and 0.38. Of course, at the temperatures exceeding the triple point temperature, the films remain disordered, and attains a large thickness close to the bulk coexistence (see Figure 19c). The above results show that there is a dewetting transition at the temperature between 0.36 and 0.37. At any temperature up to the triple point at Ttr \u2248 0.4, the bulk condensed phase has the ordered AF structure, while the film already becomes disordered at T = 0.37. At temperatures above the triple point, the bulk condensed phase and the adsorbed films are both disordered. Therefore, there is a reentrant wetting transition right at the bulk triple point temperature. Triple point wetting is a well known phenomenon, observed in many real systems [8,19,23,24,52\u201354]. It has been suggested that triple point wetting results from the mismatch between the lattice constants of solid adsorbed and bulk phases [8,54]. Gittes and Schick [22] applied linear elasticity theory to adsorbed films at T = 0 and demonstrated that a strain may lead to a long-range force that considerably inhibits wetting. In the lattice model considered presently, there is no mismatch between the lattice constants of surface and bulk phases, and hence the mechanism of the dewetting transition below the triple point temperature and the reentrant triple point wetting is bound to be different than in the already mentioned systems, which show the triple point wetting transition. The main factor leading to the dewetting transition below the triple point temperature is the high fragility of the AF structure, as compared with the SAF structure. For example, temperatures of the order\u2013disorder transition in the systems with uAB = uBB = 0 and with uBB = 0 and uAB = \u22121.0 are very similar and equal to about 0.41 and 0.404, respectively (cf. Figure 5a). However, in the case of uAB = uBB = 0, the SAF phase is so stable that it excludes the appearance of a liquid phase. It was shown in [35] that the multilayer films have a quite well-developed SAF structure, even at temperatures exceeding the critical point of layering transitions. In fact, even at T = 0.4, i.e., in close vicinity to the bulk order\u2013disorder transition, the bilayer film formed on the surface with Vo = \u22121.0 was found to form a quite well-ordered SAF structure. On the other hand, the adsorption isotherms, given in Figure 18 and the density profiles, given in Figure 19b, show that in the system with uBB = 0, uAB = \u22121.0 and Vo = \u22121.0, the film with six occupied layers disorders below the critical temperatures of the layering transitions. In the case of the system with Vo = \u22120.85, which also exhibits complete wetting in the ground state, we have found similar behavior with a lower temperature of the dewetting transition, located between 0.34 and 0.35. The reentrant complete wetting occurs at the triple point temperature again. The temperature of the dewetting transition has to go to zero when Vo approaches the limiting value of about \u22120832 from below. The wetting behavior has to change when Vo > \u22120.832, since complete wetting can take place at finite temperatures only. Indeed, such systems were found to exhibit non-wetting behavior at low temperatures, manifested by some very small surface excess densities along the adsorption isotherms, up to the bulk condensation. However, complete wetting can be expected to occur at a certain wetting temperature, Tw, which depends on the strength of the surface potential. We performed simulations aiming at the estimation of the wetting temperatures in a series of systems with Vo, between \u22120.83 and \u22120.50 and the results are summarized in Figure 20. For Vo lower than about \u22120.73, we found a crossover between the non-wetting and the partial wetting regimes at temperatures below the bulk triple point and the complete wetting right at the triple point, just as in the systems with Vo < \u22120.832. The temperature of the crossover between the non-wetting and the partial wetting increases when the surface field becomes weaker and reaches the temperature of the bulk triple point for Vo \u2248 \u22120.73.\nFor Vo greater than about \u22120.73, the recorded adsorption isotherms have shown that below the wetting temperature only the dilute submonolayer films appeared (non-wetting regime), below the wetting transition temperature. Figure 20 shows that the wetting temperature increases when the surface potential becomes weaker. Figure 21 shows the examples of adsorption isotherms for the system with Vo = \u22120.50, recorded at different temperatures between T = 0.65 and 0.69. At T = 0.65, the adsorption remains very low upon the approach to the bulk coexistence, implying that the system is a non-wet region. At temperatures between 0.66 and 0.68, the first-order prewetting transition occurs and thick films are orientationally disordered (see the inset to Figure 21). The isotherms also show that the critical temperature of the prewetting transition is located between 0.68 and 0.69. The presence of the prewetting transition is specific to the systems undergoing the first-order wetting transition [3]."

            "heading": "5. The Stability of Ordered Films and Wetting Behavior",
            "text": "Let us consider an idealized lattice model in which the adsorbed film consists of a certain number, l, of filled layers and assume that only the orientations of particles are allowed to change. Such a model allows us to verify the predictions stemming from the ground state calculations and to investigate how the stability of ordered films changes with temperature. We calculated the temperature changes of the potential energy, the heat capacity and the density profiles of differently oriented particles in the films with different numbers of occupied layers and ordering into the SAF and the AF structures. All such systems are effectively two-dimensional and one may expect that the effects of statistical fluctuations are more pronounced than in three dimensions, leading to the lowering of the order\u2013disorder transition temperature. Here, we present the results for two systems, with uAB = 0 and with uBB equal to either 0.0 or \u22121.0. In the bulk, the temperatures of the order\u2013disorder transition of these two systems are nearly the same and are equal to To(uBB = 0) \u2248 0.404 and To(uBB = 1\u2212 0) \u2248 0.41, but order into the SAF or AF structure, respectively. Figure 22 gives a series of heat capacity curves for uBB = 0.0 and different numbers of occupied layers. The second-order transitions occur in the strictly two-dimensional monolayer as expected. It should be noted that an increase of the simulation cell leads to a shift of the temperature, at which the heat capacity reaches a maximum and then the height of the maximum increases, as predicted by the finite size scaling theory of second-order transitions [55]. The stable monolayer appears only when the surface potential is stronger than 1/0.875, while the formation of stable films with any other odd number of layers is not possible at all. The films with even numbers of occupied layers are stable at low temperatures for any Vo,< 0 and disorder continuously over a wide range of temperatures (see the inset to Figure 22). The heat capacity does not exhibit any anomalies, but only some broad maxima at the temperatures above To(uBB = 0. These maxima gradually become sharper and are shifted toward To(uBB = 0 when the film thickness increases. The SAF ordering in the films of finite thickness correspond to a stacking of the bilayer lamellae with the fixed and the same orientations of particles in each lamella. At very low temperatures, the ordered structure is non-generated and hence its entropy is zero. When the temperature increases, thermal fluctuations gradually lead to some changes in the particle orientations.\nWe performed similar calculations for other systems ordering into the SAF structure and the results were qualitatively the same. In all cases, the disordering of the multilayer films was found to be gradual.\nThe model overestimates the stability of multilayer films since it neglects the density fluctuations, due to the promotion of particles to higher layers and possible desorption. On the other hand, it does not take into account the effect of surface potential on the film properties. It was shown in Figure 9 that the stability of the SAF structure in the adsorbed films in the series with uAB = 0 may considerably increase when the surface potential becomes stronger, increasing the dewetting temperature. However, in the series with uBB = 0 and AB > \u22120.5 and with uAB = uBB, we found that the dewetting temperature slightly decreases when the surface potential becomes stronger (cf. Figures 15 and 17). Nonetheless, in both cases, the stability of the ordered adsorbed films is enhanced in comparison with the bulk and the dewetting occurs at temperatures above the bulk triple point temperature. Similar calculations were carried out for the system with uBB = 0 and uAB = \u22121.0, which orders into the AF structure at sufficiently low temperatures. The inset to Figure 23 presents examples of the heat capacity curves for the films of different thicknesses. The heat capacities exhibit sharp maxima at the gradually increasing temperatures when the film thickness becomes higher. In addition, the heights of those maxima increase when the size of the simulation cell in x and y directions becomes larger, indicating the presence of continuous phase transitions. In this effectively two-dimensional model, the order\u2013disorder transition of the AF phase is continuous [40]. The main part of Figure 23 shows that the transition temperature increases from about 0.228 when l = 1 to about 0.404 for l = 40 and is expected to reach To(uAB = \u22121.0) when the number of occupied layers goes to infinity. From the results given in Figure 23, it follows that at a given temperature the formation of ordered AF structure requires the film to reach a certain thickness. Only at sufficiently low temperatures, below the temperature of the order\u2013disorder transition in the film with l occupied layers, does the AF structure becomes stable and allows for the formation of the thick ordered adsorbed phase and complete wetting. At higher temperatures, this idealized model underestimates the film thickness necessary for the recovery of AF ordering since it neglects the density fluctuations. One should note, that the temperature of the order\u2013disorder transition in an open system should converge to the lower temperature, not higher than Ttr(uAB \u2212 1.0. For example, the idealized model predicts that at T = 0.36, the film with three filled layers is orientationally disordered, while any thicker film becomes orientationally ordered. On the other hand, the local density profiles \u03c1k(z), recorded along the adsorption isotherm recorded at T = 0.36, have shown that the film with four occupied layers is still disordered and the ordering is restored in the film only after the formation of the fifth layer. The recovery of the ordering in thick films implies that complete wetting occurs since the bulk phase is also ordered at temperatures below the triple point. On the other hand, at T = 0.37, the thermal excitations become high enough to hinder the recovery of the AF ordering in the film when the chemical potential approaches the bulk coexistence. Since the coexisting bulk condensed phase is still ordered, the disordered film cannot reach a large thickness and only incomplete wetting will occur. The results presented above confirm our claim that the dewetting transition below the triple point temperature results from low stability of the AF phase in the adsorbed films."

            "heading": "6. Summary and Final Remarks",
            "text": "In this paper, we have discussed the wetting scenarios in a simple lattice fluid with orientation-dependent interactions between the nearest neighbors and demonstrated that the main factors determining the possibility of complete wetting are the structures of the coexisting bulk and adsorbed phases and the strength of the surface potential. When the surface potential is strong enough to ensure complete wetting at T = 0, all systems undergo the dewetting transition. However, the mechanism of this transition depends on the bulk phase behavior. In the case of uAB = 0 and uBB \u2264 0, the bulk system does not exhibit the gas\u2013liquid transition, but only the first-order transition between the dilute disordered and the orientationally ordered SAF phases over the temperatures between zero and To(uBB). In non-uniform systems, complete wetting occurs only when the growing adsorbed layer is ordered. When the surface potential becomes stronger, the adsorbed films disorder at the gradually increasing temperatures. As soon as the film becomes disordered, the dewetting transition takes place. The effect of the surface potential strength on the stability of ordered films and hence on the dewetting temperature, was confirmed by the results obtained for the adsorption at the selective surfaces. The temperature of the dewetting transition is independent of which side of the particle, A or B, is oriented toward the surface in the first layer, since both orientations lead to the same stability of the SAF structure. Other bulk systems ordering into the SAF phase at the sufficiently low temperatures, with uAB = uBB and with uBB = 0 and uAB > \u22120.5, exhibit the gas\u2013liquid transition over a certain range of temperatures, between the triple and critical points. The presence of a liquid phase has a great influence on the wetting. The high stability of SAF ordering causes the adsorbed films to remain ordered even at temperatures above the bulk triple point. This gives rise to a triple point dewetting transition. However, the adsorbed phase loses the orientational order at the temperatures below the bulk critical point and this leads to the appearance of the reentrant first-order wetting transition. Figure 24 presents a schematic phase diagram for such systems. Our results agree with the theoretical predictions concerning the wetting behavior in the systems in which the solid and liquid adsorbed films wet the surface and the solid-like film remains stable at temperatures exceeding the bulk triple point [8]. To some extent, our findings are similar to the results of experimental study of the oxygen adsorbed on graphite [56,57]. Notwithstanding, the origin of the dewetting and the wetting transitions in the just-mentioned experimental system and the lattice gas model is quite different. In the adsorbed oxygen, it results from\nthe presence of two different structures of solid oxygen (\u03b2 and \u03b3), while in the present model it is due to the formation of the orientationally ordered and disordered phases.\nThe wetting behavior changes when the bulk orders into the AF phase at low temperatures, up to the triple point. The stability of the AF ordering in the adsorbed films is lower than in the bulk. Therefore, the dewetting transition occurs at temperatures below the bulk triple point. However, complete wetting is restored at the triple point temperature since the bulk and adsorbed phases are liquid-like. Figure 24b shows the phase diagram expected for the systems with the surface potential strong enough to ensure complete wetting in the ground state. Here, we should recall the study of the Potts lattice gas model by Ebner [58], who obtained similar results qualitatively. Figure 24 demonstrates that the only qualitatave difference between the systems ordering into SAF and AF phases is the location of dewetting transition, resulting from the changes in the stability of surface ordered phases. When the surface potential is too weak for complete wetting to occur at T = 0, the behavior of all considered systems is qualitatively the same and depends primarily on the ratio u\u0304/Vo, with u\u0304 being the energy of pair interaction, averaged over all orientations. This is so because the wetting transition occurs at rather high temperatures, at which the adsorbed films are orientationally disordered. Therefore, the observed wetting behavior is qualitatively the same as predicted for systems with isotropic interactions [3,9]. For a given value of u\u0304, the wetting temperature gradually approaches the critical temperature when the surface potential becomes weaker. Of course, there is a threshold value of Vo, for which the wetting temperature meets the critical temperature. Although the present model does not resemble any system accessible experimentally, it does bring some important results regarding the interplay between the wetting transitions and the stabilities of the ordered surface and bulk phases. In particular, we have shown that when the ordered structure in the adsorbed layer remains stable at the temperatures beyond the bulk triple point, the triple point dewetting occurs and complete wetting may be restored at higher temperatures. On the other hand, when the film disorders below the bulk triple point, the dewetting transition also occurs at the temperature below the triple point, and reentrant wetting occurs at the triple point. It is of interest to study the wetting of particles with the orientation-dependent interactions in the off-lattice systems. The density functional study of the amphiphilic Janus particles at the walls [59] has shown that the wall induces ordering in the adsorbed films and that this ordering depends on the strength of the surface potential felt by the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic parts of the Janus-like particles. The recent experimental and molecular dynamics study of\nBanik et al. [60] produced some interesting results on the substrate wettability guided orientational ordering of the Janus particles at surfaces. The results presented in this paper should be treated as the first step of the project aiming at a better understanding of the wetting transitions in the complex systems involving the orientation-dependent fluid\u2013fluid and fluid\u2013substrate interactions.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: Not applicable.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences 1.
