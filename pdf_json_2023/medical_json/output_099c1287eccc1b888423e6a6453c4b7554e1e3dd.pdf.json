    "abstractText": "Background Comorbid metabolic disorders in patients with schizophrenia are very common. Patients with schizophrenia who respond to therapy early are often strongly predictive of better treatment outcomes. However, the differences in short-term metabolic markers between early responders and early non-responders in schizophrenia are unclear. Methods 143 first-treatment drug-na\u00efve schizophrenia patients were included in this study and were given a single antipsychotic medication for 6 weeks after admission. After 2 weeks, the sample was divided into an early response group and an early non-response group based on psychopathological changes. For the study endpoints, we depicted the change curves of psychopathology in both subgroups and compared the differences between the two groups in terms of remission rates and multiple metabolic parameters. Results The early non-response had 73 cases (51.05%) in the 2nd week. In the 6th week, the remission rate was significantly higher in the early response group than in the early non-response group (30,42.86% vs. 8,10.96%); the body weight, body mass index, blood creatinine, blood uric acid, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, fasting blood glucose, and prolactin of the enrolled samples were significantly increased, and high-density lipoprotein was significantly decreased. ANOVAs revealed a significant effect of treatment time on abdominal circumference, blood uric acid, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, fasting blood glucose and prolactin, and a significant negative effect of early non-response to treatment on abdominal circumference, blood creatinine, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose. Conclusions Schizophrenia patients with early non-response had lower rates of short-term remission and more extensive and severe abnormal metabolic indicators. In clinical practice, patients with early non-response should be given a targeted management strategy, antipsychotic drugs should be switched on time, and active and effective interventions for their metabolic disorders should be given.",

After 2 weeks, the sample was divided into an early response group and an early non-response group based on psychopathological changes. For the study endpoints, we depicted the change curves of psychopathology in both subgroups and compared the differences between the two groups in terms of remission rates and multiple metabolic parameters.\nResults The early non-response had 73 cases (51.05%) in the 2nd week. In the 6th week, the remission rate was significantly higher in the early response group than in the early non-response group (30,42.86% vs. 8,10.96%); the body weight, body mass index, blood creatinine, blood uric acid, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, fasting blood glucose, and prolactin of the enrolled samples were significantly increased, and high-density lipoprotein was significantly decreased. ANOVAs revealed a significant effect of treatment time on abdominal circumference, blood uric acid, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, fasting blood glucose and prolactin, and a significant negative effect of early non-response to treatment on abdominal circumference, blood creatinine, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose.\nConclusions Schizophrenia patients with early non-response had lower rates of short-term remission and more extensive and severe abnormal metabolic indicators. In clinical practice, patients with early non-response should be given a targeted management strategy, antipsychotic drugs should be switched on time, and active and effective interventions for their metabolic disorders should be given.\nKeywords Schizophrenia, Early non-response, Metabolic parameters, First-treatment, Drug-na\u00efve\n\u2020Junhong Zhu and Jiajia Wu have contributed equally to this work\n*Correspondence: Xuebing Liu 107768791@qq.com Jun Ma majun0313@msn.cn\n1 Department of Psychiatry, Wuhan Mental Health Center, No. 89, Gongnongbing Road, Jiang\u2019an District, Wuhan, Hubei, China 2 Wuhan Hospital for Psychotherapy, No. 89, Gongnongbing Road, Jiang\u2019an District, Wuhan, Hubei, China"

            "text": "The metabolic syndrome is known to be one of the most common comorbidities of schizophrenia that lacks effective preventive measures, and they are intricately intertwined [1, 2]. It is commonly believed that prescribing atypical antipsychotics to patients with mental illness is a high risk of developing metabolic syndromes, such as weight gain, abnormal glucose metabolism, and abnormal lipid metabolism [3, 4]. However, people with schizophrenia may develop metabolic disorders earlier than prescribed antipsychotics. Some studies have even found that metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance are already present in schizophrenia patients before antipsychotic drugs are prescribed [5\u20137]. According to reports, approximately 60% of patients with schizophrenia also meet the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome in the United States, whereas the proportion of metabolic syndrome in the general population is only 30% [8]. Another metaanalysis found that patients with schizophrenia had a higher prevalence of metabolic disorders, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, estimated to be 3\u20135 times higher than in the general population [9]. There are also some indisputable facts: schizophrenia is associated with a significant reduction in lifespan [10] and that metabolic disorders play a unique and important role in premature death [11]. In other words, the most immediate reality following antipsychotic prescription is that while antipsychotics are recognized as irreplaceable in improving patients\u2019 psychiatric symptoms, their role in curbing and mitigating the risk of metabolic syndrome and the health risks of the metabolic syndrome is negative and counterproductive.\nEarly onset hypothesis of antipsychotic drug action, confirmed and extended by Stefan Leucht et\u00a0al., primarily implies that patients taking antipsychotics improve in psychopathology more quickly in the first 1\u20132\u00a0weeks than 3\u20134\u00a0 weeks and beyond [12]. Patients with a good drug response are often a strong predictor of continued use of the same drug and a good treatment effect in the first 2\u00a0 weeks after drug treatment [13]. In addition, patients who did not improve their symptoms within the first 2\u00a0weeks of treatment were also less likely to respond later [14]. Researchers confirmed that early response to antipsychotic therapy was a significant predictor of subsequent response to treatment in patients with first-episode psychosis [15, 16]. In addition, similarly, patients with poor early response had significantly poorer later clinical outcomes and functional recovery [15, 17]. As a result, timely psychopathological evaluation of patients in the first 2\u00a0weeks of disease treatment, as well as timely adjustment of treatment strategies based on the evaluation results, plays a critical role in the clinical treatment\nand management of mental diseases, shortening hospitalization time and lowering medical burden.\nA meta-analysis found that improvements in overall symptom severity were associated with increases in body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and decreases in HDL levels in 18 commonly used antipsychotics [18]. Few people have systematically researched the impact of early or delayed response after antipsychotic drug treatment on short-term metabolic indicators in schizophrenia patients. This paper simulates a realistic clinical environment, randomly prescribes commonly used antipsychotic drugs for first-treatment drug-na\u00efve schizophrenia patients and uses a retrospective analysis method to compare the difference between early response and early non-response in the short-term remission rate of patients. In combination with previous studies, we describe the changing trend of the psychopathology of patients with early response, analyze the difference in related metabolic parameters between the patients with the early response and without early response, and attempt to provide a reference for formulating targeted antipsychotic switching regimen and metabolic index control strategies."

We used a self-made Excel spreadsheet in the electronic medical record system to extract demographic information and general clinical information of the enrolled patients. On the day of admission, PANSS was used to complete the evaluation of the degree of psychopathology of the patients, and the patient\u2019s body weight (BW), abdominal circumference (AC), body mass index (BMI), etc. were measured or calculated. The next day after admission, fasting blood was drawn, routine hematology was performed. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood lipids, renal function and prolactin (PRL), etc., were recorded one by one in the self-made EXCLE table. The aforementioned hematological indexes were detected and re-recorded at the end of the 6th week. We divided the patients into early responder and early non-responder groups according to the PANSS score reduction rate on the second weekend after taking antipsychotics. Draw and compare the change curve of psychopathology, observe the difference in the remission rate between the two groups after 6\u00a0 weeks of treatment, and compare the difference between the common metabolic indicators between the two groups.\nDrug treatment methods: the choice of antipsychotic medication for all included patients will not be interfered with, and the patient\u2019s tube bed doctor can select the type of antipsychotic medication that is optimal for the patient\u2019s medical characteristics, and antipsychotics were increased to an effective therapeutic dose within 2\u00a0weeks. After the patient\u2019s antipsychotic medication was selected, the principles of full dose, full course and single dose were strictly observed for the next 6\u00a0weeks. Patients were automatically withdrawn from the study if there were irresistible factors that necessitated a change in the type of antipsychotic or a combination of other types of antipsychotics during the study. According to the drug response, trihexyphenidyl, propranolol, and benzodiazepines can be prescribed.\nThe symptomatic assessment was conducted by two psychiatrists with unified training in the Wuhan mental health center. PANSS scores were performed on the included samples on the day of admission, the 2nd weekend, the 4th weekend, and the 6th weekend. The PANSS score reduction rate (%) = (baseline score\u2014post-treatment score)/(baseline score\u201430) \u00d7 100%. We defined the PANSS score reduction rate greater than or equal to 20% at the end of the 2nd week as the early response group (labeled as group A) and denied the early nonresponse group (labeled as group B) [19]. It is considered\n\u201cremission\u201d if the score reduction rate is greater than or equal to 75%. The PANSS is further divided into three subscales: Positive Symptoms Scale (PSS, items P1\u2013 P7), Negative Symptoms Scale (NSS, items N1\u2013N7), and General Pathological Scale (GPS, G1\u2013G16). The Positive symptom reduction rate (%) = (baseline scorepost\u2014treatment score)/(baseline score\u20147) \u00d7 100%; the Negative symptom reduction rate (%) = (baseline score\u2014 post-treatment score)/(baseline score\u20147) \u00d7 100%; the General Pathological Scale (%) = (baseline score\u2014posttreatment score)/(baseline score\u201416) \u00d7 100%."

            "text": "early response is good or bad, the deterioration trend of metabolic indicators is widespread and noticeable. However, it must be emphasized that, in the short term, abnormalities in metabolic markers in schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics were characterized by broad time-cumulative effects, and these abnormalities were more severe in early non-response patients. There is still a lot of evidence that early response to psychiatric illness is a strong predictor of later efficacy and functional recovery [20\u201322], particularly in the second week of efficacy response [23]. The present study also supports the above conclusion. During the 6-week observation period, 42.86% of the early response patients were in remission, while 10.96% of early\nnon-response patients. In clinical practice, 6\u00a0 weeks is generally considered the period for acute phase treatment and is the maximum time threshold for psychiatrists to decide whether to switch the type of drug prescribed for a patient who does not respond well to treatment. According to the present findings, 89.04% of patients with poor early response to treatment would not achieve better outcomes within 6\u00a0weeks if they continued to take the same drug. A recent multi-center clinical study found that timely switching of the drug could significantly improve symptoms in schizophrenia patients whose symptoms did not improve significantly after 2\u00a0 weeks of adequate olanzapine or amisulpride treatment compared with continuing the original drug\ntreatment, and the proportion of patients who achieved symptom relief criteria increased [24]. This finding also further supports the confidence level of the recommendations based on the present research. Therefore, we suggest that patients with poor early response to treatment can reduce the time threshold for switching types of antipsychotic drugs to 2\u00a0 weeks after treatment to minimize unnecessary hospitalization cycles and medical costs.\nIt is not difficult to find that the comorbidity of mental illness with metabolic disorders is prevalent. According to a large-scale clinical study, up to 60.7% of patients with first-episode drug-na\u00efve schizophrenia have at least one of the five components of metabolic syndrome, compared with only 36.5% in the general population [25]. In other words, schizophrenia itself is a risk factor for metabolic disorders [26]. Furthermore, it is crucial and wellstudied that the effect of antipsychotic drugs on patients\u2019 metabolic abnormalities is both evident and negative, and the underlying mechanism is also quite complex [27]. As far as inpatients are concerned, apart from the disease and drug factors, it should also include changes in the patient\u2019s living habits and environment. For example, due to space and equipment limitations in psychiatric hospitals, it is difficult for patients to control abnormalities in metabolic indicators through exercise and fitness. In short, schizophrenia with the comorbid metabolic disorder is a complex result of interweaving and interaction of many factors. Although we included a broader range of antipsychotic drug classes to weaken the effect of antipsychotic drug type on metabolism and to more objectively model the real-world environment in which Chinese patients are prescribed antipsychotics, the present study also reported that abnormal metabolic indicators after treatment were common and numerous in the included patients.\nKnown studies remain inconsistent on the relationship between various metabolic markers and psychopathology. A longitudinal cohort study of first-episode schizophrenia found no correlation between psychopathology polygenic scores and metabolic progression [28]. Another meta-analysis reported that improvements in psychopathology were associated with metabolic disturbances [18]. The present study found that regardless of early response to treatment, enrolled patients had elevated levels of a wide range of metabolic parameters (HDL levels are significantly reduced, but HDL is a protective lipoprotein, and its reduced levels also have a negative impact on the body [29, 30]). Some metabolic indicators were higher in patients with poor early response to treatment than in patients with good early response to treatment, as found at the end of this study. Thus, patients who do not respond early may be more\nBW body weight, BMI body mass index, AC abdominal circumference, BUN blood urea nitrogen, BC blood creatinine, UA blood uric acid, TC total cholesterol, TG triglyceride, HDL high-density lipoprotein, LDL low-density lipoprotein, FBG fasting blood glucose, PRL prolactin; *P < 0.05\nBW\u2014kg 58.90 \u00b1 11.18 59.49 \u00b1 10.08 \u22122.53 0.013* BMI\u2014kg/m2 21.65 \u00b1 3.33 21.93 \u00b1 3.49 \u22122.59 0.011* AC\u2014cm 78.56 \u00b1 9.29 78.75 \u00b1 9.51 \u22120.98 0.328 BUN\u2014mmol/L 3.74 \u00b1 1.20 3.67 \u00b1 1.30 0.49 0.624 BC\u2014mmol/L 57.23 \u00b1 12.90 66.90 \u00b1 20.81 \u22124.54 < 0.001* UA\u2014mmol/L 387.06 \u00b1 115.10 415.1 \u00b1 116.66 \u22122.60 0.010* TC\u2014mmol/L 3.84 \u00b1 0.75 4.70 \u00b1 1.13 \u22127.72 < 0.001* TG\u2014mmol/L 1.10 \u00b1 0.58 2.43 \u00b1 1.73 \u22129.27 < 0.001* HDL\u2014mmol/L 1.18 \u00b1 0.24 0.95 \u00b1 0.33 8.100 < 0.001* LDL\u2014mmol/L 2.18 \u00b1 0.61 2.46 \u00b1 0.84 \u22123.22 0.002* FBG\u2014mmol/L 4.52 \u00b1 0.77 5.66 \u00b1 1.42 \u22128.53 < 0.001* PRL\u2014ng/mL 18.04 \u00b1 13.49 37.06 \u00b1 40.05 \u22125.89 < 0.001*\nnegatively affected by metabolic disorders in the short term. Although this cannot be ruled out that for patients with poor response to treatment, physicians will be more active in implementing a regimen of increasing the dose of antipsychotic drugs within the scope of the rules [31]. Xiaoe Lang et\u00a0al. also found that some metabolic indicators (e.g., WC, FBG) were positively correlated with psychopathology scores in drug-na\u00efve patients in their first episode of schizophrenia [32]. In our study, the early nonresponse group maintained more severe psychopathological symptoms throughout the study period compared to the early response group. This may also be another important reason why many metabolic indicators were worse in the early non-response group. More critically, however, a clear association between premature death and metabolic syndrome has been found in patients with schizophrenia [33]. Therefore, no matter what causes the metabolic disorder to be more serious, we necessitate paying special attention to those who do not respond well to treatment early on, as well as providing interventions in a planned and purposeful manner to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome.\nIn conclusion, we found that those with early response to treatment had a higher short-term remission rate; post-treatment metabolic disorders were common and widespread regardless of early response or not. However, the abnormal metabolic indicators were more widespread and severe in the early non-responders. In clinical practice, patients with poor early response should be given a targeted management strategy, antipsychotic drugs should be switched on time, and active\nand effective interventions for their metabolic disorders should be given.\nAbbreviations PANSS Positive and negative symptoms scale score PSS Positive symptom scale score NSS Negative symptom scale score GPS General pathology scale score BW Body weight BMI Body mass index AC Abdominal circumference BUN Blood urea nitrogen BC Blood creatinine UA Blood uric acid TC Total cholesterol TG Triglyceride HDL High-density lipoprotein LDL Low-density lipoprotein FBG Fasting blood glucose PRL Prolactin ICD-10 The International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to all the medical staffs and patients in our study and to those who contributed to the diagnosis and clinical evaluation of the subjects.\nAuthor contributions JM made substantial contributions to conception and design of the study.
