    "abstractText": "Connexins and pannexins are the transmembrane proteins of highly distinguished biological activity in the form of transport of molecules and electrical signals. Their common role is to connect the external environment with the cytoplasm of the cell, while connexin is also able to link two cells together allowing the transport from one to another. The analysis presented here aims to identify the similarities and differences between connexin and pannexin. As a comparative criterion, the hydrophobicity distribution in the structure of the discussed proteins was used. The comparative analysis is carried out with the use of a mathematical model, the FOD-M model (fuzzy oil drop model in its Modified version) expressing the specificity of the membrane\u2019s external field, which in the case of the discussed proteins is significantly different from the external field for globular proteins in the polar environment of water. The characteristics of the external force field influence the structure of protein allowing the activity in a different environment.",

            "text": "The specific group of proteins that act in the membrane surrounding linking the external environment with the cytoplasm is called the transmembrane proteins [1]. Many transmembrane proteins function as gateways to permit the transport of specific substances across the membrane. The transport of molecules through the membrane can take two forms: the use of a channel passing the selected molecules and ions, and the pump transporting ions against the gradient of concentration [2\u20136]. The second type frequently requires significant conformational changes, ensuring the process called \u201cactive transport\u201d [7]. Membrane proteins require the exposure of hydrophobic residues on their surfaces to adapt to the hydrophobic environment. In contrast to this, in water-soluble proteins, the surface is covered with the polar residues while the hydrophobic ones are concentrated in the central part, forming a hydrophobic core [8]. There are several key factors contributing to the difference in hydrophobicity distribution observed between membrane proteins and soluble proteins: (1) the polar aquatic environment and hydrophobic membrane environment and (2) the folding process which is entropy-driven. Thus, hydrophobicity distribution ensures the solubility of proteins operating in the aqueous medium. Such a structure is also the effect of the active participation of the aquatic environment in the folding process. The presence of polar water directs the hydrophobic residues towards the central part of the protein. Polar amino acids are preserved on the surface, creating an entropy-favorable system at the protein-water interface. In transmembrane proteins, apart\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 1504. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines10071504 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 1504 2 of 22\nfrom the exposure of hydrophobic residues on the surface, the presence of free space in the central part of the molecule\u2014the channel\u2014shows a low hydrophobicity, in contrast to the water-soluble proteins [9]. The stabilization of membrane proteins in a hydrophobic environment creates numerous research problems due to the need for the presence of their natural environment. Nevertheless, the structures of membrane proteins appear in the PDB database [10] thanks to the use of the CryoEM technique [11] as well as X-ray [12\u201316]. Stabilization is ensured by the presence of, for example, detergent micelles in contact with the analyzed protein or in a complex with other lipid-like molecules [17\u201319]. Currently, lipids in the form of nanodiscs and liposomes can be used to stabilize membrane proteins for both structural and functional analysis [20\u201323]. The progress in the development of experimental techniques influences and makes possible the application of theoretical investigations, including the simulation of molecular dynamics [24\u201332]. Accessibility to a permanently grooving database of membrane proteins makes this research easier and more fruitful [33]. The large size of the membrane protein databases allows the investigation even of the systems biology scale [34\u201336]. Different techniques are applied to solve the main problem of the necessary presence of a hydrophobic environment [37\u201339]. The current progress in the research on membrane protein structures is presented in some excellent reviews [40]. Connexins and pannexins as well as innexins playing the common role of channels represent the special position among the membrane proteins [40]. Connexins or gap junction proteins constructed in form of six monomers are transmembrane proteins that assemble to form vertebrate gap junctions. Each gap junction is composed of two hemichannels, which are located in the plasma membrane of adjacent cells. Pannexins are channel membrane proteins formed by six or eight monomers. The way connexins and pannexins form structures within the membrane are different from each other. Connexins, unlike pannexins, have the ability to transport from the inside of one cell to the inside of the other, creating a channel running through the connected membranes of two closely approached cells. It is possible thanks to the ability to form two hemichannels linked together. Oligomeric structures of pannexins anchored in a single plasma membrane enable the construction of a channel between the cytosol and extracellular space. [41] For the analysis of the proteins discussed here, a model called fuzzy oil drop (FOD) was used which treats the hydrophobicity distribution in a protein as a result of the influence of the environment in which the protein has been folded or in which it operates. This model was originally proposed solely for the structuring of proteins in the aquatic environment. Its modified version (FOD-M) takes into account the presence of factors other than polar water, such as the presence of hydrophobic factors in the cell membrane in particular. The correctness of the operation of the FOD-M model was demonstrated in the analysis of other transmembrane proteins of the all-helical type\u2014rhodopsin [42], Beta-barrel\u2014porin [43], mechanosensitive channels [44]. The assessment of the hydrophobicity distribution, and especially the measure of the degree of deviation from the idealized distribution observed in the globular proteins with a regular hydrophobic core, allows for determining the degree of participation of non-water factors in the structuring of membrane proteins. The object of analysis in the present work is the representative of connexins\u2014human connexin Gap junction beta-2 (PDB ID 6L3T) [45]\u2014and human pannexin-1 (PDB ID 7F8J [46]\u2014CryoEM techniques were applied in both cases. The selected Cx31.3/GJC3 to represent the connexins is the exceptional one (PDB ID 6L3T) [45] due to the inability to generate the intercellular channel. It means the selected example of connexins appears solely in form of hemichannel. This form of connexin makes the comparative analysis with the pannexin reliable just limited to the search for structural similarity with respect to the structuralization in a specific environment. It delivers the possibility for other similarities/differences searches comparing the ability to generate the intercellular gap junction. It means the similarity search of the extra-cellular part of these proteins becomes an interesting object of independent analysis, which is planned to be continued.\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 1504 3 of 22"

The presentation visualizing the hydrophobicity level (option available in the PDB database) shows the specificity of discussed molecules characterized by the exposure of hydrophobicity on the surface (Figure 2E,F) The multiple sequence alignment of the two amino acid sequences (6L3T, 7F8J) using the BLASTP program [47,48] showed no sequence similarity. Since the object of analysis in this paper is the identification of differences with respect to the role of the hydrophobic environment, the analysis carried out on the basis of the fuzzy oil drop model (FOD) [49] and its modified version FOD-M [42\u201344] provides an assessment of the degree of adjustment of the hydrophobicity distribution in relation to the idealized one, which is the distribution consistent with the 3D Gauss function. For obvious reasons, the FOD-M model was used to describe the protein structures discussed here. The values of the parameter K measuring the participation of the factors different from the polar water were determined. In this particular case, it is the presence and influence of the hydrophobic environment of the membrane. The summary in Table 1 presents the status of the complexes (hemichannels) and of single chains treated as individual structural units. The assessment of the complexes is based on the generation of a 3D Gauss function spread over the entire complex. The single-chain status is defined as a 3D Gaussian function spanning a single chain.\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 1504 6 of 22\nTable 1 shows the calculated values of the RD and K parameters in the FOD-M model for the entire structural units\u2014complexes and the single chains as well as the segments defined by disulfide bonds (here, the hemichannel for connexin and channel for pannexin is taken as the structural unit). As expected, the values of parameters RD and K for both complexes show very high values. This is due to the specific nature of the environment, which significantly differs from the polar aquatic environment. The low level of hydrophobicity in the central part at the site of the expected hydrophobic core and the exposure of hydrophobic residues are the reasons for the high values of RD and K parameters for the analyzed complexes. This situation is illustrated by the T, O, and M distribution profiles for the given K value shown in Figure 3. The M profile demonstrates the T distribution\u2014the idealized one\u2014after modification introduced by the inverse of the 3D Gauss function, which expresses the presence of a hydrophobic environment. The M profile is the effect of the hydrophobic environment directing hydrophobic residues toward the surface.

The higher hydrophobicity level on the surface\u2014due to hydrophobic membrane surrounding, significant deficiency of hydrophobicity in positions of expected hydrophobic core\u2014due to the presence of channel in the central part of the complex is observed in all membrane proteins [42\u201344]. The role of the N-terminal half seems to be similar as responsible for channel construction\u2013 high hydrophobicity deficiency in connexin as well as in pannexin. The expected high level in the central part (high T values) of the complex is not met by real impacts revealing a clear hydrophobicity deficit. The C-terminal half of the chains represents the status of relatively high accordance between T and O, which suggests the role of stabilization in this area; however, the higher-than-expected hydrophobicity suggests the interaction with the membrane environment. The profile for the M distribution takes the form close to a line parallel to the horizontal axis. This is a consequence of the high K value expressing the necessary modification of the environment with respect to the water surrounding. Summarizing, it can be concluded that the T, O, and M distributions represent a typical form for membrane proteins serving as a channel. A high K value indicates a significant deviation from the distribution typical of water-soluble proteins. The segments expected to be components of the hydrophobic nucleus represent a significant deficit in hydrophobicity (channel free space). There is also an excess of hydrophobicity in the surface sections, which results from the need for stabilizing hydrophobic interaction with the surrounding membrane. The status of a single chain treated as an individual structural unit (3D Gauss function spanned on a single chain) is expressed by the T, O, and M profiles with the given values of the K parameter (Figure 4).\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 1504 7 of 22\nAn analysis f the profil s representing omplexes of connexin and pannexin reveals the similarities of profiles representing the ty ical status for membrane proteins.

The N-terminal and C-terminal local maxima in connexin represent the status of O similar to T. It suggests that the folding process for these fragments followed the water environment scenario. Two central-local maxima, however, represent the deficiency of hydrophobicity. Comparing this set of profiles with the ones shown for the complex one may cause speculation that the participation in channel construction in the complex was already prepared in the monomer structure of this chain. The participation in channel construction of the fragment representing the N-terminal local maxima appeared after complex construction. A similar interpretation can be given for the fragment representing the third local maxima. Characteristics of individual chain in pannexin identifies the N-terminal half of the chain (two N-terminal maxima) as channel constructors with evident hydrophobicity deficiency. The C-terminal half appears as representing rather high O and T similarity however with a higher hydrophobicity level on the surface. It seems that this part of chains is responsible for membrane interaction. The comparison between individual chain status and the one in complex in pannexin suggests the presence of preparation for channel construction with a high deficiency in the N-terminal half (1\u2013100 amino acid positions). The C-terminal part of the chain represents a similar status; however, the high level of hydrophobicity suggests the preparation for interaction with the membrane. The status of the segments defined by the positions of the disulfide bonds (Table 1) reveals their role as a stabilizer of the structure far from the globular protein system, giving these segments a structuring prepared to perform a biological function in the final structure within the complexes. The single-chain status of these fragments supports this observation. Similarly, the residues involved in P-P (protein-protein) interactions within individual chains represent a status typical to the exposed residues for the interaction with other chains introducing local maladjustment to the expected distribution. The reverse is the case in the complex where the status of the residues involved in the P-P interaction shows a lower RD value compared to the status of the rest of the molecule (No P-P). The status of individual chains in pannexin expresses the high exposure of hydrophobicity on the surface (RD for P-P 0.821 with RD for No P-P = 0.652) suggests that the large part of the surface with exposed hydrophobicity is \u201cconsumed\u201d by inter-chain interaction to construct the inter-chain interface. The high value for No P-P part status expresses the exposure of hydrophobicity oriented on the interaction with the membrane as it is observed in other membrane proteins [42\u201344]. This proportion is lower in connexin. The fragments with an excess of hydrophobicity in positions engaged in inter-chain interaction visualize the aim of this status observed already in the individual chain. These fragments are prepared for complexation. The fragments representing the hydrophobicity excess without engagement in protein-protein interaction are responsible for stabilization in the membrane surrounding. The analysis of the status of the individual chain makes possible the preparation of the initial structure to play a further role in the form of aimoriented interaction. The status of residues interacting with ligands (P-Ligand and No Ligand)\u2014in this case, they are the molecules mimicking the membrane that appears comparable in both compared proteins. The higher value for No-Ligand means that the disorder related to the channel formation is the stronger one that was caused by exposure to hydrophobic residues on the surface. This conclusion can, however, not be treated as general due to the limited number of membrane-mimicking molecules."

This can be read from the O profiles for the two compared chains (complexes). A significant separation of actual status from expected status becomes apparent. From the analysis given above a significant reduction in the hydrophobicity level at the sites identified as a potential hydrophobic core is apparent. Similarly, at sites expected to be surface polar, the level of hydrophobicity is comparable to that in the protein interior. The status expressed by RD and K values determines the extent to which a given target was or was not achieved in a given section. A summary of the results given in Table 2 reveals differences between the status of analogous sections in the compared proteins (Figures 7 and 8). Figure 8 reveals a similar role in hydrophobicity distribution in a particular chain in context with a complex structure. The expected high concentration of hydrophobicity informs about the central location of a particular fragment. The selected fragments seem to play similar roles in both constructions; however, this role is achieved by the opposite orientation of chains. The color arrows in Figure 7 visualize this relation. The different orientations of individual chain fragments may suggest a different course of the protein folding process in the membrane environment. It probably depends on the orientation during chain introduction into the membrane environment. The location of the analogous sections is similar, although in connexin they also include the extra-membrane part\u2014the part exposed on the outside of the cell. In pannexin, this part is not covered by the analogous segments. Summarizing this part of the analysis it should be stated that the analogous chain segments in pannexin seem to be closer to the T profile, whereas in connexin the status of these segments is clearly different from the idealized profile. The question arises as to the similarity of the sequences in the segments identified as analogous. It turns out that the sequences of the two proteins show no similarity (as reported earlier) according to the BLAST program.\nFigure 8. 3D presentation showing the analogous fragments in the complex\u2014(A)\u2014connexin, (B)\u2014pannexin.

            "text": "Summarizing the obtained results: the degree of similarity of the hydrophobicity profile turns out to be comparable for both channels. The differences are obviously due to the different chain lengths, although the system of local hydrophobicity deficits caused by the presence of the channel and local hydrophobicity redundancies on the surface sections (interaction with the membrane) turns out to be consistent with the predictions for membrane proteins with the channel present in the central part of the complex. The discussed proteins are further examples of the application of the FOD model and its modified FOD-M version to describe the structures of proteins, including transmembrane proteins in particular. Despite the visible structural similarity, as shown by the profile sets (Figures 4 and 5), the analysis of the corresponding segments shows differences in functionality (Figures 5 and 7). This conclusion is based on the assumption that the hydrophobicity distribution is important as a potential factor for the readiness for stabilization in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane as well as for potential interactions with other molecules, especially in parts exposed outside the membrane (Table 3). This is revealed in the summaries presented in Figures 6 and 9. The presence of the channel is clearly visible in all analyzes, which is expressed by a significant deficiency of hydrophobicity in the areas of the expected high concentration of hydrophobicity in the central part. The presence of similarity as well as discrepancies between these two compared transmembrane complexes playing the role of channels may identify the functional differences. The common observation is that the parts of molecules/complexes of similar status in both compared systems accordant with idealized hydrophobicity distribution can play a similar structural role to stabilize the construction. The similarities of the membrane-anchored parts seem to define the role of the environment. However, the difference in external parts may be related to the specificity of molecules transported or the system responsible for the recognition of transported molecules. From the point of view of the FOD-M model, the M distribution of linear form parallel to the X-axis may symbolize the independence of the water environment. The similarity of M distribution to R distribution represents the status deprived of any specific hydrophobicity distribution except the unified one. The general analysis of this observation is necessary for further analysis. Since connexins as well pannexins are responsible for transport they are also responsible for communication on the whole organism level. The dysfunction of these proteins causes serious diseases [50\u201359]. The therapy techniques focus the attention on stem cell application [60\u201362].\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 1504 15 of 22\nThe conclusions from the presented analysis with respect to the disorders and possible pathological consequences are of a general character. The commonly known is the influence of a mutation on the physiological role of proteins. The mutation introduces a locally or globally different structure (a classic example of sickle cell hemoglobin [63]). Nevertheless, the external conditions in which the folding process takes place turn out to be of equal importance. Application of the discussed model expressing the possible influence of the environmental conditions reveals the importance of the environment on the protein folding process including membrane proteins in particular. The commonly known change in water conditions (such as pH, salt concentration, presence of unusual chemical compounds, etc.) may influence the final protein structure to the extent of changing its role, making the activity impossible or lowering the efficiency of a particular reaction. The differences in COVID-19 pandemic scenarios were shown to be the consequence of traditional dietary customs. Particularly, permanent consumption of low percentage alcohols in the everyday diet may change the characteristics of body fluids to the degree not registered by the organism as pathological. However, the aggressive attack of the virus in changed conditions influencing the protein folding process\u2014the most sensitive one to its environment\u2014makes the defense against the virus of the organism much weaker [64]. It shall be noted that the hard alcohol consumption initiates the degradation processes while the low consumption may not. The organism gets adopted to changed conditions and specificity of the body fluids only for the normalized life scenarios. It was shown that the countries with the traditions of permanent low percentage alcohol consumption revealed significantly higher levels of morbidity as well as mortality in comparison with countries of low alcohol consumption (Far East countries with deficiency of alcohol dehydrogenase activity) [64]."

The FOD model assumes that a polypeptide chain is composed of amino acids that exhibit the nature of bi-polar molecules that in the aquatic environment tend to generate a micelle-like structure with a centric hydrophobic core. This idealized (theoretical) distribution T can be modeled by a 3D Gaussian function on the protein body. The sequence limitations where the amino acids are joined by the covalent bonds result in the observed distribution O matching the theoretical one to a greater or lesser degree. Let us formally define the two distributions T and O. The theoretical distribution T is defined by the hydrophobicity HTi (i = 1, . . . , N, N being the number of residues) expressed by the value of the 3D Gaussian function at the position of the i-th effective atom (i.e., the average position of atoms that make up the i-th residue):\nHTi = 1\nHTsum exp\n( \u2212(xi \u2212 x)2\n2\u03c32x\n) exp ( \u2212(yi \u2212 y)2\n2\u03c32y\n) exp ( \u2212(zi \u2212 z)2\n2\u03c32z\n)\nThe values for the \u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z parameters are determined based on the molecule under consideration.

Next, we introduce the reference distribution R, being the uniform one where i-th residue is assigned the same hydrophobicity \ud835\udc45 = 1/\ud835\udc41, \ud835\udc41 being the number of residues in a polypeptide chain (Figure 10B\u2014light blue line).

The values DKL(O|T) less than DKL(O|R) allow inferring the presence of a centric concentration of hydrophobicity and thus the presence of a hydrophobic core. To eliminate the necessity of using the two values, the following parameter RD Relative Distance is introduced:\nRD = DKL(O|T)\nDKL(O|T) + DKL(O|R)\nThe parameter RD expresses the degree of adjustment of the hydrophobicity distribution observed in a given structure\u2014resulting from the distribution of residues with a specific intrinsic hydrophobicity to the idealized distribution expressed by a 3D Gaussian function spread over the folding chain at a given moment of the folding process. The values of RD < 0.5 (being the cut-off value) indicate the presence of the hydrophobic core generated during the folding process. The ideal theoretical hydrophobicity distribution in the protein means the micelle-like state guaranteeing solubility without the possibility of interaction except for random interaction with ions or low molecular weight compounds. The larger deviations of the O from the T hydrophobicity distribution (i.e., when the cut-off value of 0.5 is exceeded) carry information about the specificity of a given protein, enabling, for example, interaction with a specific ligand by the appropriate adjustment of the interaction field. Of course, it is also possible to bind the polar ligand on the protein surface without disturbing the structure of the hydrophobic core. The modification of the FOD model, the so-called FOD-M model [42], extending the participation of a non-polar environment in protein folding relies on introducing the\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 1504 17 of 22\nstructural specificity of membrane proteins\u2014including membrane proteins serving as an ion channel [42\u201344].

The distribution T is modified, assigning to individual residues a status in the form of complement to the value expected for the centric distribution. However, it turns out that the omnipresence of the aquatic environment also imprints the structure of the membrane protein. Therefore, the external field directing the protein folding process turns out to be a consensus between the centric field and the inverted one, and can be expressed as:\nMi = [Ti + (TMAX \u2212 Ti)n]n\nwhere the index n denotes normalization which relies on dividing each element (i.e., the partial hydrophobicity from i-th residue) of the set by the sum of all elements in it. After normalization, the sum of all elements is equal to 1. The M distribution expresses the influence of the membrane environment in the extreme case, which is the membrane, being the fully hydrophobic environment. The coefficient K was additionally introduced to make the definition of a distribution M more universal:\nMi = [Ti + K(TMAX \u2212 Ti)n]n\nThe coefficient K expresses the consensus between the water environment (centric hydrophobic core) and the hydrophobic environment of the membrane (or the presence of any hydrophobic compound modifying the idealized distribution expressed by the 3D Gauss function).

Both these values express the degree of deviation from the micelle-like hydrophobicity distribution within the protein. The value of parameter RD represents the difference from the centric distribution while the value of coefficient K\u2014measures the participation of other than polar factors influencing the folding process.

            "text": "The applied calculation procedure is to determine the status of the chain, which includes the section identified as IDR. The characteristic is given by the RD parameter for the T-O-R relation and the value of the K parameter, which determines the degree of the proportion of a factor other than the aquatic environment. Additionally, the status of this segment IDR as a component of the structural unit is determined. If the chain has a domain structure, the structural unit against which the status of the IDR is determined is precisely the domain. The assessment of a structural unit (chain/domain) from the point of view of the fuzzy oil drop model consists in generating a 3D Gaussian function encapsulating the entire unit. The value of the RD parameter determined with it defines the status as a whole. On the other hand, the status of a section classified as IDR consists in determining the contribution of a given section to the construction of the entire structural unit. In this situation, the selected fragment of T and O profiles, which was obtained for the entire unit, is subjected to normalization and the value of RD is determined. This value determines the share of a given segment in the structure of the centric hydrophobic core. For the normalized\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 1504 19 of 22\nfragments of the T and O profiles, the optimal K value is determined, which determines the degree of modification necessary to determine the status of a given fragment of the chain. The classification is common: RD < 0.5 both for the entire structural unit and for the selected section means participation in the structure of the hydrophobic core. Otherwise, the given unit does not show the presence of a hydrophobic core, and the section with such characteristics is treated as disturbing the system expected for the hydrophobic core."

            "text": "The use of the FOD model and its modified FOD-M version enables the identification of similarities and differences, both structural and functional. In the FOD model, we assume that the distribution of hydrophobicity is a record of the stabilization of the structure (hydrophobic core) and potential interactions (the local hydrophobicity deficit expresses the readiness to interact with other molecules, and the local excess is the readiness to interact with hydrophobic systems, including the membrane). A significant deficit of hydrophobicity at the site of the expected hydrophobic core is the identification of the channel\u2019s presence. A high level of hydrophobicity over almost the entire surface means preparation for interaction with the membrane. The differentiation of the sections with the O profile comparable to the T profile means that the stabilization centers are adapted to the structure of a given protein. The compatibility of these two profiles is a factor of stabilization resulting from a balanced system resulting from intramolecular interactions and external factors. The FOD-M model turns out to be universal. The soluble proteins are described by 0 < K < 0.4. The values of 0.4 > K > 0.0 in globular proteins prove a different degree of influence on the structuring of proteins of external factors. The identification of specificity identified in a periplasmic protein expressed by K = 0.6 also suggests the possibility of the universal character of the FOD-M model [70]. The comparison of the currently analyzed proteins with other proteins active in the membrane environment reveals their significant differentiation expressed, for example, by the value of the K parameter from relatively low such as K = 0.6 to the value K > 3 [42\u201344]. Therefore, the analysis of other groups of membrane proteins is carried out.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization. I.R. and L.K.; methodology. K.S.; software. K.S.; validation.
