Exploring the Effects of β-ionone Liposomes on Other Cancer Cell Lines: While the study focused on HeLa cells, extending the research to other cancer cell lines, such as prostate, pancreatic, and melanoma cells, could provide a broader understanding of β-ionone liposomes' therapeutic potential. This would help in identifying specific cancer types that might benefit the most from β-ionone liposome treatment.

Investigating the Combination of β-ionone Liposomes with Other Anticancer Agents: The study demonstrated that adding DOTAP enhanced the cellular uptake of β-ionone liposomes. Future studies could explore the co-encapsulation of β-ionone with other anticancer agents in liposomes to evaluate synergistic effects on cancer treatment efficacy, potentially reducing the required dosage and associated side effects of each drug.

Long-term In Vivo Efficacy and Toxicity Studies: While the in vitro results are promising, assessing the long-term efficacy and toxicity of β-ionone liposomes in animal models would be crucial. Such studies could help in understanding the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and potential side effects of β-ionone liposomes in a living organism, providing critical data for preclinical evaluation.

Development of Targeted Delivery Systems: Given the positive charge of the DOTAP-enhanced liposomes, future research could focus on modifying the liposome surface with targeting ligands or antibodies that specifically bind to cancer cell markers. This targeted approach could improve the specificity and efficacy of β-ionone liposome delivery to cancer cells, minimizing effects on healthy cells.

Mechanistic Studies on the Role of DOTAP in Enhancing β-ionone Efficacy: The paper highlighted the role of DOTAP in improving the physicochemical properties and cellular uptake of β-ionone liposomes. Further research could delve into the molecular mechanisms by which DOTAP and β-ionone interact with cancer cell membranes and intracellular pathways. Such studies could uncover new insights into the anticancer activity of β-ionone and optimize liposome formulations for enhanced therapeutic outcomes.
