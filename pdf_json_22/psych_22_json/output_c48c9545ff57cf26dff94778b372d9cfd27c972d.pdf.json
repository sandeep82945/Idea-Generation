    "abstractText": "One way to improve the relationship between humans and anthropomorphic agents is to have humans empathize with the agents. In this study, we focused on a task between agents and humans. We experimentally investigated hypotheses stating that task difficulty and task content facilitate human empathy. The experiment was a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with four conditions: task difficulty (high, low) and task content (competitive, cooperative). The results showed no main effect for the task content factor and a significant main effect for the task difficulty factor. In addition, pre-task empathy toward the agent decreased after the task. The ANOVA showed that one category of empathy toward the agent increased when the task difficulty was higher than when it was lower. This indicated that this category of empathy was more likely to be affected by the task. The task itself used can be an important factor when manipulating each category of empathy.",

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nHumans use a variety of tools to perform tasks in society. Media acquisition is when humans treat artifacts like humans [1]. It has been shown that humans develop similar feelings toward artifacts as they do toward other humans. In fact, there are examples of humans empathizing with artifacts in the same way that they empathize with humans. Typical examples of artifacts we empathize with include cleaning robots, pet-type robots, characters in competitive games, and anthropomorphic agents that provide services such as for online shopping and at help desks. However, there are a certain number of humans who cannot accept agents [2]\u2013 [4]. Such agents are already in use in human society and coexist with humans. However, when a task is performed by a human and an agent, there is a problem when the human considers the agent to be a tool. When we use agents as tools, we may not need to empathize with them, but the result is that we treat agents less well when they are used in place of humans. Therefore, empathy from the human to the agent is essential when the agent is a supporter or competitor of the human. Humans and anthropomorphic agents already interact in competitive and cooperative tasks. For humans to have a good relationship with agents, they need to have empathy for them. Empathy makes it easier for humans to take positive action toward an agent and accept the agent. Although there have been various studies on factors that cause empathy, such as verbal and nonverbal information, situations, and relationships, we focus on tasks and experimentally examine how task difficulty and task content affect empathy. In this study, we focus on\n1Takahiro Tsumura and Seiji Yamada is with Department of Informatics, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI, Tokyo, Japan.

            "text": "In the field of psychology, empathy has been the focus of much attention and research. Omdahl [5] classified empathy into three main categories: (1) affective empathy, which is an emotional response to another person\u2019s emotional state, (2) cognitive empathy, which is a cognitive understanding of another person\u2019s emotional state, and (3) empathy that includes both of the above. Preston and De Waal [6] proposed that at the heart of empathic responses is a mechanism that allows the observer access to the subjective emotional state of the subject. The Perception-Action Model (PAM) was defined by them to unify the differences in empathy. They defined empathy as a total of three types: (a) sharing or being affected by the emotional states of others, (b) evaluating the reasons for emotional states, and (c) the ability to identify and incorporate the perspectives of others.

[7] described theoretical and empirical support for the affective specificity of empathy and developed an emotion-specific empathy questionnaire that assesses affective and cognitive empathy for six basic emotions.\nVarious questionnaires are used as measures of empathy, but we used the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). IRI, also used in the field of psychology, is used to investigate the characteristics of empathy [8]. There is another questionnaire, the Empathy Quotient (EQ) [9], but we did not use it in our study because we wanted to investigate which categories of empathy were affected after experiencing the task.\nIn the fields of human-agent interaction (HAI), humanrobot interaction (HRI), and human-computer interaction (HCI), empathy between humans and agents or robots is studied. In the field of HCI, research is focused on empathy. Wright and McCarthy [10] discussed the use of empathy, citing studies that have used empathy in HCI. Pratte et al. [11] analyzed 26 publications on empathy tools and developed a framework for empathy tool designers.\nThe following studies have been conducted in various areas of HRI. Leite et al. [12] conducted a long-term study in elementary schools to present and evaluate an empathy model for a social robot that interacts with children over a long period of time. They measured children\u2019s perceptions of social presence, engagement, and social support. Zhi et al. [13] examined whether robots can have the social influence to induce nearby bystanders to stop the abuse by humans and actively defend against human abuse.\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n06 12\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.H C\n] 1\n3 Ju\nn 20\n22\nIn addition, the following studies have been conducted in the field of HAI. Richards et al. [14] noted that it is important to design intelligent virtual agents that influence users\u2019 emotions and intrinsic motivations. They determined the circumstances in which users respond to different verbal expressions of empathy. Okanda et al. [15] focused on appearance and investigated Japanese adults\u2019 beliefs about friendship and morality toward robots. They examined whether the appearances of robots (i.e., humanoid, dog-like, oval-shaped) differed in relation to their animistic tendencies and empathy.\nA study of cooperative and competitive tasks was conducted by Ruissen and de Bruijn [16]. In the study, cooperative and competitive tasks were tested using Tetris. The results confirmed that the cooperative task did not reduce self-integration, but the competitive task did. Another study of competitive tasks between humans and robots is that of Kshirsagar et al. [17]. They performed a humanrobot competitive task using the same task and found that participants preferred a lower-performing robot to a higherperforming one. Boucher et al. [18] performed a human-robot cooperation task. The robot recognized gaze guidance to the human faster than the robot gave voice instructions to the human.\nSome studies of task difficulty include the following. Fuentes-Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. [19] used chess problem-solving tasks of different difficulty levels to investigate participants\u2019 heart rate variability in terms of difficulty, stress, complexity, and cognitive needs. Cho [20] considered that task difficulty and mental workload are necessary to improve the usability and frequency of use of interactive systems and proposed a new approach for automatically estimating task difficulty by focusing on human blinking.\nPaiva defined the relationship between human beings and empathic agents, referred to as empathy agents, as designed in previous HAI and HRI research. As a definition of empathy between an anthropomorphic agent or robot and a human, Paiva represented empathy agents in two different ways and illustrated them [21]\u2013[23]: A) targets to be empathized with by humans and B) observers who empathize with humans.\nWe have taken these figures and summarized them in Figure 1. T stands for target, E for event, and O for observer, and t represents the passage of time. The arrows from T and E to O are the information that O needs to empathize with targets. This information includes facial expressions, behaviors, and changes in the surrounding environment. O responds empathetically to this information and T\u2019s information as well. This is the white arrow. Empathy agents and humans are divided into T and O. When the agent is T, it is an empathic target agent, and when the agent is O, it is an empathic observer agent. In this study, we use the empathic target agent to promote human empathy."

We are the first study to relate task difficulty and task content to empathy and apply it to HAI. This research will facilitate the application of agents used in human society by influencing human empathy. In addition, if there is a change in human empathy due to the influence of a task, the importance of the task can be discussed among humans. For these purposes, we developed two hypotheses.\n\u2022 When performing a competitive task with an empathy agent, the higher the task difficulty, the more human empathy is suppressed. \u2022 When cooperating with an empathy agent, the higher the task difficulty, the more human empathy is promoted.\nThe above hypotheses were determined by inferring from the results of the Ruissen and de Bruijn [16] and FuentesGarc\u0131\u0301a et al. [19] studies. The above hypotheses were reached because, in cooperative tasks, humans improve their performance and have favorable impressions of their cooperating partners, whereas in competitive tasks, they think less about their adversaries.\nIn addition, as empathy changes with task difficulty, the higher the difficulty, the greater the mental load, and the greater the impact on performance. Therefore, we hypothesized that, in competitive tasks, the higher the task difficulty, the more human empathy would be suppressed.\nIn comparison, in the cooperative task, task performance was improved by quickly reading the intentions of the cooperating partner, which may be related to perspective taking in the cognitive empathy category. Since the task was facilitated by putting oneself in the other person\u2019s shoes and reading the other person\u2019s actions, we hypothesized that human empathy is facilitated in cooperative tasks as the task difficulty increases.\nAn experiment was conducted to investigate these hypotheses with a two-factor between-participants design with two factors: task difficulty and task content. The number of levels for each factor was two for difficulty (high, low) and two for content (competitive, cooperative). Participants took part in only one of four different content conditions. The dependent variable was the empathy held by the participants."

As mentioned, the purpose of this study is to promote human empathy toward anthropomorphic agents. When performing a task with an anthropomorphic agent, the environment is assumed to be accessed via a PC rather than in reality, so we thought that the same effect could be achieved even with an online environment.\nBefore performing the task, a questionnaire was administered to measure the empathy toward the empathy agent. At this point, participants were not allowed to make judgments about the task difficulty or task content. The reason for administering the questionnaire before the task was to check for differences in participants\u2019 empathy toward the agent.\nTasks were set up differently depending on the content of the competition and cooperation, but to avoid drastic changes in task content, the common denominator was to move between squares within a range of 16 (4 \u00d7 4 squares). Common to all tasks was that participants always moved from the bottom left square, and the agent always moved from the top right square. The mass movement were above, below, to the left, and to the right of the current point, and the same square could only be passed through once. The total number of moves that could be made alternated, but the total number for the agent was indicated at the start. The reason why this information for the agent was given advance is that it increased the difficulty of the task and reduced the difference in difficulty between the two difficulty levels. If this information were not given, participants would need to think about how many moves the agent could make, which would be burdensome and would affect the judgment of the difficulty level. The task was made simple so that the comparison of difficulty levels would not be affected by the selections of the agent while trying to anticipate their movement total. Every task had a checkpoint, and\nthe purpose was to pass through this point. The squares selected by the participants were colored blue, the squares that could be moved to next were colored light blue, the squares selected by the agent were colored light green, and the checkpoints were colored vermilion.\nThe task was performed three times in total, with different checkpoint locations. The total number of moves varied depending on the difficulty level of the task: eight for the high difficulty and four for the low difficulty. In the competitive task, the purpose was to pass more checkpoints than the opponent, while in the cooperative task, the purpose was to pass checkpoints through cooperation. Other detailed conditions are explained in later sections.\nTo examine only the factors of interest in this experiment, the appearance and behavior of the agents were also standardized. In addition, agents did not speak during the task but only made minimal gestures. Participants interacted with an agent in one of four conditions, combining task difficulty (high, low) and task content (competitive, cooperative).\nAfterwards, the participants\u2019 empathy toward the agent was aggregated by another questionnaire similar to before the task. Then, the participants were asked to write their impressions of the experiment in free form."

The following conditions were used for different levels of difficulty.\nA) The total number of squares that could be moved to was eight for the high difficulty level and four for the low difficulty level. B) The number of checkpoints was seven for the high difficulty level and five for the low difficulty level. C) In the case of the competitive task, the high difficulty level required the participant to act in such a way that at least four checkpoints were passed, while the low difficulty level required them to act in such a way that at least two checkpoints were passed. D) In the case of the cooperative task, for the high difficulty level, the human and agent had to cooperate to pass all seven checkpoints, and for the low difficulty level, they had to cooperate to pass at least four checkpoints.\nBy reducing the total number of moves to be made by half and simplifying the expected number of checkpoints that the participants and agents had to pass through for the lowdifficulty level, the number of trials was made to have a significant effect on the difficulty level.\n2) Task content: Two types of task content were prepared. By keeping the task environments as close as possible, we eliminated external factors and tried to measure the effect of task content on human empathy. The two types of task content were competitive and cooperative.\nIn the competitive task, the task was a checkpoint competition, and the number of checkpoints required to win varied depending on the difficulty level. Points were awarded to the first person to pass each checkpoint. The win ratio for a total of three tasks was one win, one loss, and one tie,\neven when participants took the optimal actions. The win rate was adjusted to reduce the impact of the win rate on human empathy.\nIn the cooperative task, the purpose of the task was for the participant and agent to pass all the checkpoints, and the total number of checkpoints varied with the difficulty level. The high difficulty level required the human and agent to cooperate to pass all seven checkpoints, and the low difficulty level required them to cooperate to pass at least four checkpoints. The maximum number of checkpoints that can be passed by each participant in a total of three tasks was adjusted. This was done to prevent one side from always passing too many odd-numbered checkpoints. It does not make sense if both parties pass through the same checkpoint."

For multiple comparisons, Holm\u2019s multiple comparison test was used to examine the existence of significant differences.\nTable 2 shows the results of the overall analysis. The results of the questionnaire analysis showed a main effect of task difficulty on affective empathy. The results are shown in Figure 4.\nInitially, as can be seen from Table 2, we examined differences in empathy toward the agent among the participants and found no differences between any of the conditions. Therefore, we assumed that the ability to empathize with the agent was similar among the participants. In this study, the questionnaire on pre-task empathy toward the agent was given only to confirm that there were no differences between participants. Therefore, we do not discuss significant differences between the pre- and post-task cases.\nThe post-task results showed no interaction between task difficulty and task content, regardless of empathy category. For the 12 items, there was also no main effect of each factor [F (1,564) = 2.4737]. Similarly, no main effect of task content was found [F (1,564) = 0.5918]. However, a main effect was found for task difficulty [F (1,564) = 4.0986] based on the analysis of affective empathy in Table 2. The main effect of post-task task-difficulty was higher for affective empathy for the higher difficulty level (high difficulty: mean = 18.9155, S.D. = 3.7113; low difficulty: mean = 18.2535, S.D. = 4.0647), as shown in Figure 4. On the basis of the above analysis, the results of this experiment suggest that a higher task difficulty promotes affective empathy.\nThe post-task values were lower than the pre-task values\nof empathy toward the agent in each condition (all pretask: mean = 38.3838, S.D. = 5.9490; all post-task: mean = 37.3415, S.D. = 6.7214). Also, for affective empathy, pre-task emotional empathy values were higher (all pretask: mean = 19.2817, S.D. = 3.6216; all post-task: mean = 18.5845, S.D. = 3.9027). Similarly, for cognitive empathy, pre-task cognitive empathy values were higher (all pre-task: mean = 19.1021, S.D. = 3.2094; all post-task: mean = 18.7570, S.D. = 3.4835).\nSince a main effect was found for task difficulty in affective empathy, we conducted an analysis by category of affective empathy. The results showed that only personal distress had a main effect on task difficulty [F (1,564) = 5.2007]. The main effect of post-task task-difficulty was higher for affective empathy for the higher difficulty level (high difficulty: mean = 9.2148, S.D. = 2.5428; low diffi-\nculty: mean = 8.7148, S.D. = 2.6769), as shown in Figure 5."

Main effects results of personal distress\nin empathy before and after the task. If only post-task surveys had been conducted, a higher task difficulty would have been shown to increase human empathy. However, by conducting a pre-task survey, it was found that empathy actually decreased throughout the task. This result indicated that post-task changes do not necessarily lead to better results than pre-task changes.\nIn addition, the fact that empathy for the agent decreased with the task in this experiment indicates that the task may decrease empathy. However, as a limitation of this experiment, it is possible that the simplicity of the task itself may have decreased empathy because the task itself was perceived as tedious, due to eliminate factors other than task difficulty and task content.\nHowever, the fact that task difficulty did not affect the task content but affected human affective empathy may be an effective factor in controlling human empathy when empathic agents coexist in human society in the future. By setting the task difficulty appropriately, it is possible to maintain an appropriate distance from an agent without making the\nparticipant empathize more than necessary. The results of the analysis, which classified empathy into affective empathy and cognitive empathy, showed a main effect of task difficulty on affective empathy. The main reason for this main effect is thought to be that affective empathy increased as task difficulty increased due to the increased mental load caused by the task. This is related to personal distress, which is classified as affective empathy. Affective empathy is the feeling of the emotional state that others are experiencing or about to experience, which leads to the same emotional state in oneself. Only affective empathy was enhanced because the mental load from the task affected the emotional states of both the participant and agent. No main effects of task difficulty or task content were observed for cognitive empathy. This is because cognitive empathy requires imagining the thoughts and feelings of others in terms of oneself and imagining them from the other\u2019s point of view, so the task in this experiment did not enhance cognitive empathy."

The analysis revealed that a higher task difficulty increased emotional empathy after the task. The task itself can be an important factor when manipulating each category of empathy.
