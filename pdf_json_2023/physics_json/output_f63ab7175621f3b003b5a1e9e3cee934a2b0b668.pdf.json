The ion gelation method prepared free chitosan nanoparticles and chitosan nanoparticles containing L. citriodora EO and citral. The successful loading of the EO and citral was evaluated using ATR-FTIR. The DPPH assay measured the antioxidant effect of citral, L. citriodora EO, Citral-ChiNPs, L. citriodora-ChiNPs, and Free-ChiNPs. A375 melanoma cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. The qPCR technique was employed to evaluate the expression of apoptotic genes, and flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis.\nResults This study showed that in equal concentrations, the antioxidant properties of chitosan nanoparticles containing citral were greater than those of chitosan nanoparticles containing L. citriodora. The IC50 values of chitosan nanoparticles containing citral, L. citriodora EO, and their nonformulated states were 105.6, 199.9, 136.9, and 240 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. The gene expression results showed that the ratio of the expression of the apoptosis gene to the inhibitory gene was higher than 1 in all the samples, indicating that the conditions for apoptosis were present. Flow cytometry confirmed cell apoptosis, with 93.5 \u00b1 0.3% in chitosan nanoparticles containing citral, 80 \u00b1 0.2% in chitosan nanoparticles containing L. citriodora EO, 63 \u00b1 0.3 in citral, and 42.03% in L. citriodora EO-treated cells.\nConclusion The results showed that using the Nano form of L. citriodora and citral increased their efficiency in apoptosis pathways and their toxicity against 375 melanoma cancer cells.\nKeywords Melanoma, Essential oils, Citral, L. citriodora, Chitosan, Nanoparticles"

            "text": "International Agency for Research on Cancer; 325,000 new skin cancer cases and 57,000 deaths were recorded in 2020. In addition, it is estimated that between 2020 and 2040, the number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 500,000 per year, and the number of fatalities will surpass 100,000 per year [1]. There are two primary skin cancer types: nonmelanoma and malignant melanoma. Cutaneous melanoma is a cancerous growth in melanocytes. These cells are located in the basal layer of the epidermis and are responsible for producing melanin, which determines skin color [2]. Malignant melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, posing a significant health challenge due to its resistance to radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy [3\u20135]. Investigation of 42 melanoma cell lines at the transcriptome level has shown that the A-375 cell line has minor sensitivity to chemotherapy [6].\nEssential oils (EOs) are an excellent resource for developing new anticancer agents due to various compounds with anticancer, antitumor, and antiproliferative properties and few side effects [7, 8]. In addition, they also have a high potential for antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant effects [9, 10]. However, as their low solubility in water should be formulated, preparing nanostructures containing EOs is a promising approach for solubility and efficacy improvement [11, 12]. Chitosan nanoparticles with biodegradability, biocompatibility, and mucosal adhesion properties are among the most common carriers [13, 14]. In addition, they have a variety of beneficial properties, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticoagulant, antitumor, antihypertensive, hypocholesterolemic, and antidiabetic effects [15].\nLippia citriodora (Lemon verbena) has been used in traditional medicine to relieve various symptoms, such as digestive issues, fever, cold, asthma, diabetes, spasms, insomnia, and anxiety [16]. In addition, research has shown that the flavonoid and phenol content in L. citriodora EO contributes to its significant antioxidant activity [17, 18]. Moreover, some studies have demonstrated the free radical scavenging abilities of L. citriodora to infusion against superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and hypochlorous acid in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo systems [19]. Interestingly, some researchers have suggested that L. citriodora EO can inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells [20, 21]. Furthermore, citral is a significant component of EOs obtained from various lemon-scented herbal plants, such as L. citriodora EO. Citral exhibits biological effects, such as anticancer, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities [22, 23]. Moreover, citral possesses antitumor properties in mouse cancer models when administered orally as part of their diet [24, 25].\nThe present study aimed to evaluate and compare the cytotoxicity and antioxidant properties of L. citriodora\nEO, citral, and chitosan nanoparticles containing each against A375 human melanoma cells. After that, qPCR and flow cytometry techniques were used to measure their effects on apoptosis regulator genes and the percentage of apoptotic cells, respectively."

The above steps were also performed to make chitosan without anything (Free-ChiNPs).\nThe sizes of Free-ChiNPs, Citral-ChiNPs, and L. citriodora-ChiNPs were investigated using a DLS-type apparatus (K-One nano Ltd, Korea). To calculate particle size distributions (SPAN), D90\u2014D10 \u2044 D50 was used. D is the diameter, and D10, D50, and D90 are percentiles of particles with a diameter lower than these values.

Then, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates (10,000 cells per well) and incubated for 24\u00a0h. Next, the culture medium of each well was replaced with 50\u00a0\u00b5l of RPMI complete culture medium. After that, the cells were treated with citral, L. citriodora EO, Citral-ChiNPs, L. citriodora-ChiNPs, and Free-ChiNPs at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800\u00a0\u00b5g/ml and incubated for 24\u00a0h.\nAfter 24\u00a0h, 100\u00a0\u00b5l of MTT solution (0.5\u00a0mg/ml in PBS) was added to the wells and then incubated for 4\u00a0 h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C.

After that, the absorbance of each sample and control (untreated with sample) well was read using an ELISA reader (Synergy HTX Multi-Mode reader, USA) at a wavelength of 570\u00a0nm. Finally, the cell viability at each concentration was calculated by (OD sample/OD control) \u00d7100.\nqPCR technique The qPCR technique was employed to evaluate the expression of apoptotic-involved genes, including Bax pro-apoptotic and Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic genes. Initially, 50,000 A375 cells per well were seeded in 6-well plates. The cells were then treated with Free-ChiNPs (200\u00a0 \u00b5g/ mL), L. citriodora-ChiNPs (200\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL), L. citriodora EO (200\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL), citral (100\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL), and Citral-ChiNPs (100\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL) followed by incubation for 24\u00a0 h at 37\u00a0 \u00b0C. Next, total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol RNA extraction kit (Yektatajhiz). The wells were washed with PBS, and the liquid content was discarded.\nThe cells were centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 700\u00a0g, and then 500\u00a0\u00b5l of TRIzol was added to the pellet and shaken for 6\u00a0min at room temperature. Then, 100\u00a0\u00b5l of chloroform was added, and after staying at room temperature for 3\u00a0min, the sample was centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 15,000\u00a0g. Next, 500\u00a0 \u00b5l of isopropanol was added to the supernatant in a new microtube, kept at -20\u00a0 \u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, and then centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 15,000\u00a0g. Next, 200\u00a0\u00b5l of 75% alcohol was added to the residue and centrifuged for 5\u00a0min at 15,000\u00a0g; the ethanol was discarded, and the obtained pellets were dried at 50\u00a0 \u00b0C (two times). After that, the extracted RNA was dispersed in DEPC water and assessed for quality and quantity using a Nanodrop apparatus (Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader, USA). The purity of RNA and protein contamination was determined by measuring the absorbance (OD) ratio at 260 and 280\u00a0nm. A ratio of > 1.8 was considered indicative of a pure sample.\nA cDNA synthesis kit (Yektatajhiz, Iran) was used to synthesize cDNA. Initially, the extracted total RNAs were mixed with oligo dT and DEPC water and incubated for 5 and 1\u00a0min at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 4\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Subsequently, 5X strand buffer, dNTPs (10 mM), RNasin (40 U/\u00b5L), and M-MLV were added to the mixture and subjected to the Bio-Rad Thermocycler apparatus. The thermal program was set at 60\u00a0min at 42\u00a0\u00b0C, and the resulting cDNAs were stored at \u2212 20\u00a0 \u00b0C. Amplification was performed using a qPCR machine (StepOnePlus, Applied Biosystems, USA) and RealQ Plus 2x Master Mix Green high ROX\u2122 (Amplicon, Denmark). The master mix (Green High Rox), forward and reverse primers for each gene (Pishgam Biotech Co., Tehran, Iran, see Table\u00a01), and cDNA template were combined to a final volume of 20\u00a0 \u00b5l using DEPC water. Amplification reactions were then carried out under the following conditions: 10\u00a0min at 95\u00a0\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s, 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s. The relative fold changes in the expression of target genes (Bax and Bcl-2) with \u03b2-actin as an internal control were normalized using the 2\u02d7\u0394\u0394CT method, where \u0394CT = CT target \u02d7 CT reference, \u0394\u0394CT = \u0394CT test sample \u02d7 \u0394CT control sample, and relative expression = 2\u02d7\u0394\u0394CT.\nApoptosis detection using flow cytometry To confirm the induction of apoptosis, A375 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with different formulations of Free-ChiNPs (200\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL), L. citriodoraChiNPs (200\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL), L. citriodora EO (200\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL), citral (100\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL), and Citral-ChiNPs (100\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL) for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The Annexin-V/FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection Kit protocol (MabTag, GmbH, Germany) confirmed apoptosis. The cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1x Annexin-V binding buffer. Then, Annexin-V conjugate and propidium iodide solution were added to the cell suspension and incubated for 20\u00a0 min in the dark at room temperature. After incubation, 1x binding buffer was added, mixed gently, and analyzed using flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA). FlowJo software (BD, Becton, Dickinson, and Company) was used to determine the numbers of viable cells, cells undergoing necrosis (positive for PI), early apoptosis (positive for Annexin-V/FITC), and late apoptosis (double-positive for Annexin-V/FITC and PI)."

The five most abundant compounds found in the EO were citral (25.97%), limonene (12.09%), curcumin (10.27%), caryophyllene (6.91%), and 1,8-cineole (5.42%).\nPhysicochemical properties of the prepared nanoparticles Fifteen nanoformulations were prepared to obtain chitosan nanoparticles with desired properties, i.e., droplet size < 200\u00a0nm and SPAN < 1. Table\u00a03 shows that different TPP concentrations were screened; samples containing 0.2% TPP [13\u201315] showed the best size characteristics. Their DLS and zeta potential diagrams are shown in Fig.\u00a01. The particle size, SPAN value, and zeta potential of free-ChiNPs were 31 \u00b1 5\u00a0 nm, 0.97, and 43 \u00b1 1 mV, respectively. In addition, these values for Citral-ChiNPs were 35 \u00b1 4\u00a0nm, 0.94, and 44 \u00b1 1 mV, and for L. citriodoraChiNPs, they were 94 \u00b1 6\u00a0nm, 0.98, and 35 \u00b1 3 mV. Moreover, their TEM images are depicted in Fig.\u00a02.\nThe ATR-FTIR spectra of L. citriodora EO (Fig.\u00a0 3A) displayed a broad peak at 3469\u00a0cm\u2212 1, which can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group due to hydrogen bonding in phenolic and alcoholic compounds in EO. The bands at 2961, 2922, and 2857\u00a0cm\u2212 1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of CH, and the strong peak at 1675\u00a0 cm\u2212 1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of carbonyl groups. The 1633 and 1445\u00a0cm-1 bands can be related to C = C stretching vibrations.\nThe ATR-FTIR spectra of citral (Fig.\u00a0 3B) showed that the band at 3009\u00a0 cm\u2212 1 can be related to the stretching vibration of CH in sp2 groups due to alkene structures. The bands at 2967, 2915, and 2856\u00a0 cm\u2212 1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of CH in sp3 groups; the band at 1671\u00a0cm\u2212 1 can be related to the stretching vibration of carbonyl groups. The 1632 and 1441\u00a0cm-1 bands can be related to unsaturated C = C in citral.\nThe ATR-FTIR spectrum of free-ChiNPs (Fig.\u00a03C) displayed a broad band at approximately 3200\u20133600\u00a0cm\u2212 1, which can be related to the hydroxyl group due to hydrogen bonding. The band at approximately 3009\u00a0 cm\u2212 1 is related to = CH, and the peaks at approximately 2925 and 2855\u00a0cm\u2212 1 can be related to \u2013C-H starching vibration. The sharp peak at 1711\u00a0cm\u2212 1 can be related to C = O stretching in Tween and chitosan. Two peaks at 1278 and 1098\u00a0 cm\u2212 1 belong to anti-symmetric stretching vibrations of PO2 groups in TPP (TPP) ions. These bands demonstrated the ionic links between the NH3 + of chitosan and the anionic structure of TPP.\nThe ATR-FTIR spectra of Citral-ChiNPs (Fig.\u00a03D) displayed a broad peak at approximately 3200\u20133700\u00a0 cm\u2212 1 related to OH groups due to hydrogen bonding between"

            "text": "In this study, L. citriodora EO was used as a natural anticancer agent. Citral (25.9%) was identified as its main constituent. The results of other studies also show that citral is the main ingredient of L. citriodora EO [27, 28]. Citral (geranial) is a noncyclic monoterpene aldehyde (C10H16O) insoluble in water with anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic properties [29, 30].\nThe current study used the ionic gelation method to prepare nanoparticles containing L. citriodora EO and\ncitral. In other studies, L. citriodora EO and citral nanoemulsions have been reported; however, their chitosan nanoparticles were not reported [31, 32]. This study explored the potential anticancer effects of L. citriodora EO and its major compound, citral, on the A375 melanoma cell line. To enhance their cytotoxicity against A375 cells, chitosan nanoparticles containing EO and citral were prepared. The results showed that treatment with 200 and 100\u00a0 \u00b5g/ml of L. citriodora-ChiNPs and CitralChiNPs decreased cell viability by 25% and 28%, respectively. Some reports on proposing chitosan nanoparticles containing EOs have been published. For example, viability of A375 cells after treatment with 75\u00a0\u00b5g/mL Syzygium aromaticum EO and chitosan nanoparticles containing this EO were observed at 97 and 45% [33]. Another study showed chitosan nanoparticles loaded with Morinda citrifolia EO (40\u00a0 \u00b5g/ml) have 54% cell cytotoxicity on A549 human lung cancer cells [34]. In another study, researchers reported that chitosan nanoparticles loaded with celandine (Chelidonium majus L.) EO had more significant cytotoxicity on the MCF-7 cell line compared to its non-nano form; cell viability was 32 and 63%, respectively [35].\nThis study investigated the antioxidant and anti-cancer activity of EO and citral and their nanoparticle forms. The antioxidant power increased with the increase in concentration, which has been confirmed in other studies [36, 37]. The human body is affected by a variety of disorders that have been linked to free radicals. Free radicals can cause damage to proteins, DNA, and RNA, leading to genetic mutations that can contribute to cancer development. All living cells express an antioxidant defence system to combat the harmful effects of free radicals. This system can be classified in various ways depending on the antioxidant source. Antioxidants can be obtained from dietary intake (exogenous) or produced by the body (endogenous). Research has demonstrated that antioxidants reduce cancer incidence [38, 39].\nCancer cells can survive by upregulating the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein and downregulating the pro-apoptotic Bax protein. Modifying the ratio of Bax to BCL2 and increasing the level of Bax causes the accumulation of Bax in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membranes, which facilitates the release of apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome c and then caspase, which subsequently leads to apoptosis [40, 41]. EOs have been found to trigger programmed cell death in cancer cells through various mechanisms, including apoptosis, necrosis, cell cycle arrest, and disruption of vital cellular organelles [42, 43]. In the current investigation, a notable difference was observed in the expression of these two genes in cells treated with citral-ChiNPs and L. citriodora-ChiNPs compared to the citral, EO, and control groups.\nIn the present study, flow cytometry was applied to measure the amount of apoptosis and distinguish it from necrosis in cells exposed to environmental stressors and decomposition. The findings showed that Citral-ChiNPs resulted in the highest percentage of cell death through apoptosis. Based on the findings from flow cytometry and qPCR analysis, it can be inferred that the cells underwent programmed cell death, leading to alterations in the expression of apoptotic genes.\nNumerous mechanisms have been proposed for the mode of action of citral that induces apoptosis in cancer cells. One of these mechanisms is the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, initiated by releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria, activating a cascade of caspases that ultimately leads to apoptosis [30]. Another mechanism involves the inhibition of proteins that are involved in cancer cell survival and proliferation. For instance, one study showed that citral inhibited the activity of the protein STAT3 in small-cell lung cancer, leading to decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis [44]."
