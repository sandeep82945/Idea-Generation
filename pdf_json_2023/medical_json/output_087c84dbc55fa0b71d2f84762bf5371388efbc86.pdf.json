Methods: Four hundred and fifty Arbor Acres (AA) broilers at 42 days of age were divided into 5 groups with 6 replicates in each group and 15 chickens as one replicate. Following this period, broilers from each group were distributed among five groups according to preslaughter fasting period as 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 h. Results: With increasing fasting time, the carcass yield (p<0.01), the breast muscles yield (p<0.01) and the thigh yield (p<0.01) of the broilers were all linearly increased. With increasing fasting time, the L* values (p<0.01), cooking loss (p = 0.020), moisture content (p<0.01) in the leg muscles linearly downregulated, while the drip loss (p = 0.043), pH45 min (p<0.01) and pH24 h (p<0.01) were linearly upregulated. A trend for a lower (p = 0.071) shear force in the leg muscles was also observed in broilers fasted for longer time. Similar results were also found in breast muscles. The different fasting treatments did not influence the breast muscles glycogen content (p>0.10), while the increase of fasting time resulted in a linear decrease of the blood glucose (p = 0.021) and, more specifically, the glycogen content of the liver and leg muscles (p<0.001). With increasing fasting time, the aspartate transaminase (p<0.01), uric acid (p<0.01), and triglycerides (p<0.01) in serum linearly downregulated, while the alanine aminotransferase was linearly upregulated. Conclusion: The results of this study show a significant influence of fasting time on carcass yield and meat quality in broilers. Moderate fasting (8 to 12 h) before slaughter can reduce the weight loss of broilers. Prolonged fasting (\u226516 h) increased body weight loss, decreased slaughtering performance and fluctuating blood indexes of broilers.\nKeywords: Broilers; Carcass Yield; Fasting; Glucose Metabolism; Meat Quality\nINTRODUCTION\nBefore slaughter, broilers were stimulated by factors such as fasting, capture, cage loading and transportation, which seriously affected the welfare of broilers and had a negative impact on meat quality [1,2]. Fasting time is one of the key factors affecting meat quality and slaughter rate [3-5]. It is common practice to fast broilers for several hours before slaughter [6-8]. Fasting can empty the chyme in the digestive tract of animals, reduce the possibility of carcass contamination by feces during slaughter, and also reduce transportation stress and mortality [9-11]. Too short or unrestrained fasting time will lead to waste of feed taken several hours before slaughter and increase transport stress [12]. However, excessive fasting will increase the weight loss of broilers [13], reduce the glycogen content [14], and then reduce the slaughter weight [15]. A reasonable fasting time will ensure optimal weight loss, feed waste, and animal stress for broilers. After fasting, with the nutritional supply of broilers stopped, the metabolic activity changes\n* Corresponding Author: Tietao Zhang Tel: +86-181-8688-4251, Fax: +86-0431-8191-9867, E-mail: zhangtietao@caas.cn\n1 College of Animal Science, Anhui Science and Technology University, Fengyang, 233100, China 2 Institute of Special Animal and Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changchun 130112, China"

This will lead to increased weight loss [17], resulting in economic losses for the slaughterhouse. In addition, serum biochemical parameters in broilers will change after fasting [13]. After slaughter, the oxygen supply of body is stopped while energy is still needed for cell activities under anaerobic conditions, which will lead to glycolysis and lactic acid accumulation, thus reducing the pH value of muscles and affecting the color and water retention of meat [16-18]. Excessive fasting before slaughter will lead to a large consumption of muscle glycogen while the bird is alive leading to less glycogen content in muscles after slaughter, and less lactic acid produced by glycolysis. Arbor Acres (AA) broilers are characterized by fast growth rate, high adaptability, high feed conversion rate and good carcass quality. They were introduced into China in the early 1980s, and AA broilers are now a common commercial broiler breed and widely farmed in the broiler industry. At present, there are few studies on the effects of fasting time on meat quality and glucose metabolism in broilers. Therefore, this experiment took AA broilers as the research object to explore the effects of fasting time before slaughter on body weight loss, meat quality, glucose metabolism and serum biochemical indexes, to provide theoretical reference for actual production."

Fasting causes body weight loss mainly due to three reasons: the excretion of intestinal contents, the loss of muscles\u2019 water, and the oxidation metabolism of nutrients for energy supply [1,22]. Fasting for 6 to 10 h resulted in reducing the likelihood of carcass of broilers, mainly due to the excretion of intestinal contents [11]. The body weight loss is slightly slower from 12 to 20 hours of fasting, mainly due to metabolic activity and water loss. This study confirms that muscle moisture content also decreases with increasing fasting time. Fasting before slaughter causes economic losses to the slaughterhouse due to weight loss. Ali et al [16] found that fasting for 24 hours did not affect the fat content, abdominal fat rate and fatty acid composition of chicken. However, the reduction of water content in chicken also affects the final carcass yield and meat quality, such as meat color and tenderness [9,23]. Most of the water in the animal body is in the muscles, accounting for 69% to 75% of the total muscle weight [24]. The loss of water in the process of slaughtering will inevitably cause economic losses in the slaughterhouse. This study showed that the water content of the chest muscles and leg muscles decreased with the increase of fasting time, but the water content of the chest muscles and leg muscles was significantly lower than the control group only after 24 hours of fasting. Blood lipids mainly consist of fatty acids and cholesterol, and their concentrations depend on the absorption and excretion in the intestines, as well as absorption and secretion in cells [25]. Normally, the concentration of fatty acids in the blood will temporarily increase after ingestion [26]. The animal\u2019s intestines absorb free fatty acids, which are synthesized into triglycerides in the liver and then transported into the\nblood in the form of lipoproteins [27]. Triglycerides in the blood are kept in dynamic equilibrium under normal conditions [17]. Fasting inevitably leads to the oxidative metabolism of fatty acids to supply energy. The rate of triglyceride synthesis in the liver slows down and the oxidative decomposition for energy supply accelerates after fasting, thus causing a decrease in the content of plasma triglycerides. Research results show that fasting before slaughter will reduce serum triglyceride levels in broiler chickens [28,29]. This study indicates that the serum triglyceride content in broiler chickens decreases with the prolongation of fasting time, and during fasting, triglycerides in the blood of broiler chickens are converted into fatty acids for energy supply, but triglycerides in the tissues have not yet been converted into fatty acids during short-term fasting. Fasting before slaughter will lead to the depletion of stored energy in animals [16]. Glycogen is the form of energy storage in animal body cells, and its synthesis and decomposition can maintain normal blood glucose levels. The liver and muscles of animals store the most glycogen, which are called liver glycogen and muscles glycogen respectively. After eating, excessive monosaccharides absorbed by the intestines are synthesized into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles to avoid high blood glucose [30]. When the blood glucose concentration decreases after fasting, the liver glycogen is decomposed into glucose and enters the blood to supplement blood glucose [31]. The muscle glycogen is partially decomposed into lactic acid oxidation for energy supply, and most of the rest is circulated to the liver with blood, and is converted into liver glycogen through gluconeogenesis, thus supplementing blood glucose. Fasting for a long time before slaughter resulted in a large consumption of muscle glycogen. After slaughter, the glycogen content in muscles was less, and the lactic acid produced by glycolysis was also less. This\nTable 5.

With the extension of fasting time, the glycogen in the leg muscles showed a downward trend. The blood glucose levels of broilers remains relatively stable, and the production and utilization are in a dynamic balance. After fasting, the absorption of glucose in the intestine decreases, the glycogen stored in the liver is decomposed quickly, the conversion of fat and protein is relatively slow, and the oxidation and energy supply of blood sugar increases, resulting in a sharp decrease in blood sugar levels [12]. This study showed that the prolongation of fasting time reduced the concentration of serum glucose. After slaughter, the muscles oxygen supply is stopped, while the cell activity still needs energy under anaerobic conditions, which will lead to the accumulation of lactic acid. So, this study shows that the muscles pH value shows an upward trend with the prolongation of fasting time. The reason may be that after a long period of fasting, the glycogen consumption in the muscles supplies energy, the glycogen content in the muscles decreases, and the lactic acid produced by glycolysis decreases, resulting in a higher pH value [32]. The muscles pH value at 20 h after slaughter mainly depends on the muscles\u2019 glycogen storage. This study shows that muscle glycogen is basically not consumed after fasting for 0 h, so muscles glycogen storage is more, lactic acid produced by glycolysis is also more, and muscle pH is lower at 20 h after slaughter. Prolonged fasting time (\u22658 h) leads to glycogen metabolism and energy supply of muscles, resulting in higher pH value of muscles after slaughter. Some studies have shown that the L* value of muscles is significantly negatively correlated with pH [12,33]. In this experiment, the prolongation of fasting time before slaughter significantly increased the L* value of meat color and reduced the shear force, which is consistent with the research results of Partanen et al [34]. Serum albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma, which is synthesized in the liver and accounts for a large proportion of plasma protein. Its main function is to regulate blood osmotic pressure [35,36] The normal serum albumin levels of broilers remained relatively stable [37]. With the increase of fasting time, the absorption of protein in the intestine of broiler chickens decreases, and the rate of the liver albumin synthesis decreases [28]. This study shows that serum albumin concentration also decreases with fasting time. In this study, the activity of AST in broiler serum increased with the prolongation of fasting time, which may be due to the change of broiler metabolic activity after fasting, from anabolism to catabolism. ALT mainly exists in hepatocytes, and acute hepatocyte damage can cause a sharp increase in the activity of ALT enzyme in blood. This study shows that the activity of serum ALT decreases with the prolongation of fasting time, indicating that fasting for 24\nhours does not cause damage to hepatocytes. Serum UA content is an index to evaluate the protein decomposition of birds [38]. In this study, the content of serum UA decreased with the prolongation of fasting time, which indicated that the oxidative decomposition of protein in fasted broilers decreased, which may be a protein retention mechanism."

            "text": "The results of this study show a significant influence of fasting time on carcass yield and meat quality in broilers. Moderate fasting (8 to 12 h) before slaughter can reduce the weight loss of broilers. Prolonged fasting (\u226516 h) which increased body weight loss, decreased slaughtering performance and produced fluctuating blood indexes of broilers."
