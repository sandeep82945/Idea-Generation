    "abstractText": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. Thirty percent of patients will experience locoregional recurrence for which median survival is less than 1 year. Factors contributing to treatment failure include inherent resistance to X-rays and chemotherapy, hypoxia, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and immune suppression. The unique properties of C radiotherapy including enhanced cell killing, a decreased oxygen enhancement ratio, generation of complex DNA damage, and the potential to overcome immune suppression make its application well suited to the treatment of HNSCC. We examined the C radioresponse of five HNSCC cell lines, whose surviving fraction at 3.5 Gy ranged from average to resistant when compared with a larger panel of 38 cell lines to determine if C irradiation can overcome X-ray radioresistance and to identify biomarkers predictive of C radioresponse. Cells were irradiated with C using a SOBP with an average LET of 80 keV/mm (CNAO: Pavia, Italy). RBE values varied depending upon endpoint used. A 37 gene signature was able to place cells in their respective radiosensitivity cohort with an accuracy of 86%. Radioresistant cells were characterized by an enrichment of genes associated with radioresistance and survival mechanisms including but not limited to G2/M Checkpoint MTORC1, HIF1a, and PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling. These data were used in conjunction with an in silico-based modeling approach to evaluate tumor control probability after C irradiation that compared clinically used treatment schedules with fixed RBE values vs. the RBEs determined for each cell line. Based on the above analysis, we present the framework of a strategy to utilize biological markers to predict which HNSCC patients would benefit the most from C radiotherapy.",

Story1*\n1 Univeristy of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Radiation Oncology, Dallas, TX, United States, 2 Medical Physics Unit & Research Department, Foundazione Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO), Pavia, Italy\nHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. Thirty percent of patients will experience locoregional recurrence for which median survival is less than 1 year. Factors contributing to treatment failure include inherent resistance to X-rays and chemotherapy, hypoxia, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and immune suppression. The unique properties of 12C radiotherapy including enhanced cell killing, a decreased oxygen enhancement ratio, generation of complex DNA damage, and the potential to overcome immune suppression make its application well suited to the treatment of HNSCC. We examined the 12C radioresponse of five HNSCC cell lines, whose surviving fraction at 3.5 Gy ranged from average to resistant when compared with a larger panel of 38 cell lines to determine if 12C irradiation can overcome X-ray radioresistance and to identify biomarkers predictive of 12C radioresponse. Cells were irradiated with 12C using a SOBP with an average LET of 80 keV/mm (CNAO: Pavia, Italy). RBE values varied depending upon endpoint used. A 37 gene signature was able to place cells in their respective radiosensitivity cohort with an accuracy of 86%. Radioresistant cells were characterized by an enrichment of genes associated with radioresistance and survival mechanisms including but not limited to G2/M Checkpoint MTORC1, HIF1a, and PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling. These data were used in conjunction with an in silico-based modeling approach to evaluate tumor control probability after 12C irradiation that compared clinically used treatment schedules with fixed RBE values vs. the RBEs determined for each cell line. Based on the above analysis, we present the framework of a strategy to utilize biological markers to predict which HNSCC patients would benefit the most from 12C radiotherapy.\nKeywords: carbon ion radiotherapy, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, radioresistance, relative biological effectiveness, prediction of radioresponse\nFebruary 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 8129611"

            "text": "The potential therapeutic advantage of particle radiotherapy was recognized in the 1940s and was based upon the physical properties of the energy deposition patterns of said particles. Since that time, particle therapy has continuously developed predominantly based upon advances in engineering, imaging, and physics. The first dedicated clinical heavy ion therapy center was opened in 1994, and this facility focused on the use of accelerated carbon ions because of the physical and biological advantages over photons and protons including steeper lateral dose penumbra at greater depths in the body, a higher LET which results in a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and took into account the experience gained at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where the initial results for the use of heavy charged particles as a cancer therapy took place (1\u20134).\nSince then, carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) has been used against intracranial cancers, head and neck cancers, primary and metastatic lung cancers, gastrointestinal tumors, sarcomas, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and pediatric cancers at what has grown to become 12 carbon centers across the globe, although none currently exist in the USA. CIRT has been shown to exert a strong antitumor effect in tumors resistant to conventional photon therapy; however, some tumor sites have been less amenable to therapy over concerns for the response of adjacent normal tissues. Whereas, the efficacy of CIRT has been shown for nonsquamous tumors like mucosal melanomas (5, 6), adenocarcinomas and sarcoma (7, 8), and adenoid cystic carcinomas (9, 10); in tumors that are considered radioresistant or chemoresistant, the use of CIRT for squamous cell carcinomas, the most common type of head and neck cancer, has been limited (11\u201313).\nGiven the technologic advances in recent years for proton and heavy ion radiotherapy, the potential benefit from the increased conformity of charged particles and higher LETs seen with 12C ions against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) of the oral cavity, larynx, pharynx, and nasopharynx in a fashion that is beneficial for sparing organs at risk such as tissues of the oral cavity, the spinal cord, or bony structures like the mandible and vertebrae has been considered and acted upon. For example, the multi-institutional in silico trial designated ROCOCO describes the benefits of particle therapy and in particular CIRT, in a trial of reirradiation for recurrent HNSCC (14). In that study, comparing reductions in mean dose to organs at risk, particle therapy\u2014using protons and carbon ions, both achieved reductions in complications with a dosimetric benefit for carbon ions over protons which they attributed to conformity, that is, dose to the normal tissue as suggested by other studies (15\u201317).\nCIRT facilities have a highly limited capacity to treat the millions of individuals who are diagnosed with cancer each year, and even with new facilities coming online, it remains a limited medical resource where patients should be stratified in order to optimize the use and efficiency of CIRT. Tumors of the head and neck should be ideal for the use of CIRT because head and neck regions have functionally important anatomic sites amenable to dose conformality and the additional cell killing effects of high LET radiations, particularly for low LET-resistant (photon and proton) tumors. Furthermore, identification of patients as\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 2\npotentially radioresistant by omics or other analysis that requires tumor sampling, is less complicated in H&N cancers based upon ease of access to tumor tissue.\nIntuitively, DNA repair-related biomarkers would be particularly useful for predicting radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy outcomes for HNSCC. Ku80, a mediator of DSB repair, was established as the first candidate DNA repair biomarker to show potential predictive value for head and neck radiotherapy in a cohort of archival HNSCC specimens from irradiated patients (18). In this series, Ku80 was overexpressed in half of tumors, and its expression was independent of all clinical and genetic covariates examined. Ku80 overexpression was an independent predictor for both locoregional failure and mortality following radiotherapy (p < 0.01) conferring a 9-fold greater risk of mortality at 2 years. Furthermore, using a battery of HNSCC cell lines, tumor growth and metastatic potential were determined in an orthotopicmodel of oral tongue cancer, including how TP53 mutations influence tumor growth and metastasis (19) and how disruptive mutations in TP53 lead to treatment failure by inhibiting radiation-induced senescence (20). Besides the identification of Ku80 and TP53 as potential negative prognostic indicator in HNSCC, Eschrich et al., using the Radiosensitivity Index (RSI) in a retrospective study of HNSCC treated with radiochemotherapy identified a radiosensitive cohort of patients that saw improved locoregional control (21). However, as argued here, identifying tumors that are likely radioresistant would seem more appropriate for the selection of patients to be treated byCIRT.\nTowards that goal of defining radioresistance for patient triage, 38 HNSCC cell lines were collected and interrogated for their g-ray radioresponse via clonogenic survival. An approximately 4-fold range of radiosensitivity as measured by SF2 or SF3.5 was determined. At the molecular level, these 38 cell lines have been assayed for basal gene and miRNA expression as well as DNA methylation, and our future goal is to integrate gene expression, miRNA expression, and methylation patterns with cell survival to characterize radioresponse.\nHowever, for this study, these 38 HNSCC cell lines were agnostically divided into 4 groups, radiosensitive, moderately radiosensitive, moderately radioresistant and radioresistant, based on SF3.5 values. A signature of 37 genes built from the basal gene expression of each cell line was then developed that could stratify these cell lines into their respective radiosensitivity cohorts with 86% accuracy. From these 38 cell lines,fivewere chosen to characterize the behavior of moderately radioresistant and radioresistant cell lines to 12C ion exposures to determine the radioresponse to 12C ions, calculate RBE values using different endpoints, and model tumor control probabilities for a series of dose and fraction combinations to expose the variability in tumor control probability when a fixed RBE is used as opposed to a personalized RBE within a radioresistant population of HNSCC tumor cell lines."

Those groups are described as sensitive (S), moderately sensitive (MS), moderately resistant (MR), and resistant (R). The cluster is\nFebruary 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 812961\naccompanied by the cell line identity and the respective SF3.5 values. SF3.5 was chosen based upon the conclusions of Johansen et al. (31), who suggest SF3.5 as more representative of radiosensitivity where a larger dose per fraction might be used as in stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) or CIRT.\nTo determine whether there were differences in gene expression underlying these radiosensitivity cohorts, an SVM model was trained using the most significantly changed genes. As depicted in Figure 2A, a 37-gene panel could place the cell lines within their respective radiosensitivity cohort with an accuracy of 86%. Figure 2B represents the SF3.5 for the cell lines directly above in Figure 2A and reflects the trend in cell line radioresponse from radioresistant on the left to radiosensitive on the right. Furthermore, if cell line segregation was adjusted to identify the three radioresistant lines from all others, only 13 genes were required (Figure 2C). Genes segregating the R cohort include those associated with radio/chemoresistance (GAGE12C, GAGE2E, SPINK1), metabolic processes (PNLIPRP3), proliferation\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 6\nmigration, invasion and metastasis (PARM1, CDH12, CYYR1, GAGE12C), and inhibition of apoptosis (SPINK1).\nGSEA and IPA were used to examine differences in Hallmark Pathways (GSEA) and canonical pathway signaling (IPA). As shown in Figure 3, when the R cohort was compared with all others, cholesterol metabolism, G2M checkpoint, PI3K/AKT/ MTOR, and MTORC1 pathways were enriched with Normalized Enrichment Scores being 1.5988, 1.7422, 1.258, and 1.363, respectively. IPA pathway analysis identified HIF1a and ERK/ MAPK pathways as upregulated along with a number of other pathways that were up- or downregulated based upon Z-scores.\nThese same pathways were then interrogated in a gene expression dataset derived from 102 flash-frozen HNSCC tumor specimens from patients treated by postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) using a consistent treatment protocol (23, 32, 33). The gene expression data from 49 patients characterized as having NED and 35 patients characterized as having had LR were used. As shown in Figure 3, the GSEA\nFebruary 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 812961\nHallmark Pathway cholesterol metabolism, G2M checkpoint, PI3K/AKT/MTOR, and MTORC1 were also enriched in the LR group when compared with those designated NED. Not surprisingly, their Normalized Enrichment Scores were somewhat lower than that seen in the cell lines.\nNext, we examined the 12C radioresponse of five HNSCC cell lines whose SF3.5 ranged from average to resistant when compared with the larger panel of 38 cell lines to determine if 12C irradiation can overcome radioresistance. Radiation survival curves were generated using 137Cs as a low LET radiation and 12C ions were generated by the Carbon Therapy Center in Pavia, Italy (CNAO). The cell lines SqCC/Y1 and UMSCC1 were chosen to represent the range of SF3.5 in the MR group with an emphasis on the high end of response; HN31 represents the highest SF3.5 in the MS cohort; and HN5 and SCC9 represent the R cohort.

Those values are found in Table 2.\nUsing the survival data for both g-rays and clinical 12C ions from the five HNSCC cell lines, TCP curves were generated based upon Antonovic etal. (30). The calculation of TCP differs slightly from the study of Antonovic et al. (30) in that the tumor model created was fully oxygenated and the LET is fixed. Fractionation schedules (IMRT, 12C) were based upon schedules used in recurrent H&N cancers treated at the Shanghai and Heidelberg Heavy Ion radiotherapy facilities (34, 35) where we chose an RBE value of 3, which is in line with that used clinically, as well as the RBE values determined for each cell line.

The alternatives for recurrent HNSCC include surgery with or without adjuvant radiochemotherapy with survival rates of 40%\u201366% (36), but the rates of grade 3 or grade 4 toxicities can be as high as 40% (37\u201341) with only 1 in 3 patients surviving reirradiation without recurrence or severe complications (42).\nThe high total doses fromprior radiotherapy limit the total dose acceptable for reirradiationbasedupon the toxicity to organs at risk. However, a retrospective analysis of patients treated at the Heidelberg Ion-beam Therapy Center (HIT) by reirradiation for recurrent HNSCC with CIRT developed little in the way of either acute or late severe (>Grade III) toxicity (35) using a median total dose of 51GyE in 3GyE fractions. The Shanghai Proton andHeavy\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 9\nIonCenter in a trial of recurrentHNSCC found similar results (34). Late toxicities (> Grade III) were seen in 7.1% of patients as compared to HIT where late toxicities occurred in 14.5% of patients. The primary tumor sites in these two series of patients were vastly different with Shanghai for instance having ~83% of cases representedbysquamous carcinomas (nasopharyngeal cancer representative of 78% of all cases) while only 28%of theHIT cohort was squamous carcinoma. These differences in patient population likely drive the differences in toxicity profiles and compare well to reirradiation trials for head and neck cancers using proton therapy where late toxicities ranged from 7% to 8%, 20%, and 24.6%, respectively (43\u201345).\nThe comparable overall improvements in late normal tissue toxicities in H&N cancers treated with CIRT suggest the potential for overall improvements in outcome in primary and recurrent disease as well as the potential for dose escalation in tumors identified as radioresistant. Also, given the limitations of access,\nFebruary 2022 | Volume 12 | Article\n812961\nif patients with tumors that are radioresistant can be identified, the argument could bemade to treat those patients where possible with 12C ions. RadioresistantHNSCCcan bemanifested via a number of mechanisms, the predominant mechanism being hypoxia, but resistance may also be through acquired mechanisms of enhanced DNArepair, abrogationof apoptosis or through thedevelopmentof a tolerogenic immune environment. 12C ions\u2014or for that matter other ions separately or in combination\u2014should at least partially overcome these limitations.\nDetermining radioresistance in a clinically useful manner is not straightforward as there are currently no clinically useful biomarkers of radioresistance in HNSCC with the possible exception of HPV status. Because of the ease with which tumors can be biopsied in H&N cancers, an omics approach is feasible. To test this approach, 38 HNSCC tumor cell lines were tested for radiosensitivity via clonogenic survival. Basal gene expression analysis was then tested as a surrogate for clonogenic survival and found to be capable of segregating the most radioresistant cell lines from the other cell lines. Furthermore, the gene expression patterns in these radioresistant cell lines supported their classification as radioresistant. Besides identifying some of the more commonly identified genes and pathways associated with radioresistance, one of the more intriguing finds is the increased expression of the GAGE genes. These genes are not expressed in normal tissue with the exception of testes. In tumors, members of this family (GAGE1 and 2) are CD4+T cell antigens, attracting T cells into tumors. GAGE12 family members have been shown to increase both radio- and chemoresistance and metastasis (46\u201348). Other genes identified included SPINK1, an inhibitor of apoptosis that has\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 10\nbeen associated with chemoresistance (49, 50), and PARM1 which is an androgen-related gene that drives tumor proliferation (51, 52). Mechanistic analysis of any role for the genes in HNSCC radioresistance is warranted.\nAssuming that one will be able to identify radioresistance so that patients could be triaged to receive 12C ion therapy is of little benefit if this cohort of patients is then not treated to full potency. That potency is based upon an understanding of the dose equivalence for a given situation\u2014or individual. Unlike stochastic processes such as radiation-induced carcinogenesis which uses the Seivert (Sv) for dose equivalent, dose equivalent for 12C radiotherapy is described as GyEq, GyE, or GyRBE because there is no unit definition for dose equivalent in a deterministic setting. GyEq relies on the determination of the RBE for a given endpoint. The earliest determinations of RBE, still used today, were based upon cell survival in mostly rodent (CHO) cell lines and the human radioresistant salivary tumor cell line HSG, which was determined to be contaminated with HeLa cells (53, 54). The initial 12C scattered beam at NIRS was normalized to the dose-averaged LET at 80 KeV/\u00b5m using their clinical neutron RBE of 3.0 as they were equally effective (55). This along with their experience with neutron exposures led them to use this value in their NIRS treatment planning system across all tumor sites. However, it is likely that \u201cclinical RBE\u201d is not a fixed value and should be personalized where possible. Furthermore, RBE can be a poor descriptor of the radiobiology associated with charged particle therapy as there are many factors that determine a RBE value, and it suffers from the inability to make direct comparisons from one method of determination to another or treatment regime to another (26, 30, 56). Therefore, we determined the\nFebruary 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 812961\n12C RBE in a small cohort of moderate to radioresistant cell lines using multiple endpoints and then applied the survival and RBE values to model tumor control probability and asked whether individualization of RBE could be consequential when compared to a generic value.\nFigure 5 depicts tumor control probability curves for the 5 tumor cell lines. Dose fractionation schemes include a standard 2 Gy/fraction scheme, a SAbR fractionation scheme of 8 Gy per fraction, and a 3 GyE per fraction approach (generic RBE of 3). As expected, TCP varied according to the radiosensitivity of the tumor with the most resistant tumors requiring greater overall total doses to achieve the modeled tumor cure. The TCP curves for the HN31, which is intermediate in radiosensitivity, is far to the left of the more radioresistant lines in the upper left panel (IMRT 2 Gy/fraction) and at 60\u201370 Gy total dose TCP is roughly between 30% and 90%. The remaining TCP curves for the more radioresistant cells falls well outside with total doses of 90\u2013120 Gy required to achieve 50% control. Total doses for the TCP of a SAbR regimen are far less but also suffer from a lack of efficacy for very radioresistant tumors and would be expected to be constrained by an increased risk for normal tissue complications.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 11\nThe TCP curves for 12C, because this is GyE and uses a more conventional fraction size, is comparable with the conventional 2 Gy/fraction regimen. The SabR approach with 12C ions may be more effective for carbon ions but suffers the same complications as a conventional SAbR approach within the radioresistant subset.\nIn Figure 6, we attempted to determine the underdosing for a given tumor if a fixed RBE vs. an individually determined RBE was used. TCP curves include (a) the TCPusing the generic RBE of 3 for each cell line from Figure 5; (b) the 12C physical dose associated with the TCP determined using the generic RBE; and (c) the physical dose if the TCP curve based upon an RBE of 3 were modifiedby theRBEdetermined for eachcell line.Thatdifference in the physical dose curves could be considered as an \u201cunderdosing\u201dof 12Cphysical dose and it is consequential in that it reflects the need to understand the intrinsic radioresistance for a given tumor. Those values of \u201cunderdosing\u201d at a TCP of 70% are given in Table 3.\nIn this manuscript, we have attempted to draw attention to the need for individualizing therapy based upon the intrinsic radioresponse of a tumor. Head and neck squamous cells were used because of the recent trials where HNSCC are being treated\nFebruary 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 812961\nwith 12C and because HNSCC outcomes have seen little improvement. At least for cell lines, gene expression was able to segregate radioresistant tumor cell lines from cell lines less resistant. One could argue that 38 cell lines do not bring enough diversity of radiosensitivity as the most radioresistant cell lines were few in number. Also, while there was overlap in the enrichment of specific pathways in common between cell lines and tumors that were treated with PORT, it is evident that much work is needed, irrespective of the gene expression analysis.\nUsing five cell lines whose radiosensitivity ranged from moderate to resistant across the 38 cell line panel, the potential impact of intrinsic radiosensitivity was tested by determining TCP curves using various radiation regimens for both g-ray and 12C exposures. This exercise highlighted the potential for underdosing radioresistant tumors when generic rather than personalized RBEs were used, which would negate the impact of triaging patients with radioresistant tumors.\nWe understand that our TCP calculations reflect fully oxygenated tumors, did not reflect tumor response to varied LETs, etc., but our goal is more one of relative comparisons and not necessarily quantitative comparisons. What we require are data from actual tumors treated with curative intent using X-rays and 12C ions with different dose and fractionation schedules and a realistic understanding of the impact of tumor hypoxia to challenge and ultimately improve upon the biophysical modeling of CIRT with the intent to ultimately personalize therapy."
