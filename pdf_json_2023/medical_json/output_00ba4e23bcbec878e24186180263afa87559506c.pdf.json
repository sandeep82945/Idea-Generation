    "abstractText": "Solar-driven evaporation technology is often used in areas with limited access to clean water, as it provides a low-cost and sustainable method of water purification. Avoiding salt accumulation is still a substantial challenge for continuous desalination. Here, an efficient solar-driven water harvester that consists of strontium-cobaltite-based perovskite (SrCoO3) anchored on nickel foam (SrCoO3@NF) is reported. Synced waterways and thermal insulation are provided by a superhydrophilic polyurethane substrate combined with a photothermal layer. The structural photothermal properties of SrCoO3 perovskite have been extensively investigated through state-of-the-art experimental investigations. Multiple incident rays are induced inside the diffuse surface, permitting wideband solar absorption (91%) and heat localization (42.01 \u25e6C @ 1 sun). Under 1 kW m\u22122 solar intensity, the integrated SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator has an outstanding evaporation rate (1.45 kg/m2 h) and solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency (86.45% excluding heat losses). In addition, long-term evaporation measurements demonstrate small variance under sea water, illustrating the system\u2019s working capacity for salt rejection (1.3 g NaCl/210 min), which is excellent for an efficient solar-driven evaporation application compared to other carbon-based solar evaporators. According to the findings of this research, this system offers significant potential for producing fresh water devoid of salt accumulation for use in industrial applications.",

            "text": "Fresh water scarcity is emerging as a global concern because of limited resources, an expanding global population, and climate change, which is only expected to worsen, especially in underdeveloped nations and regions [1,2]. Since three quarters of the Earth is covered by oceans, which contain 97% of the total water on the planet, sea water is a seemingly endless resource for clean water [3\u20135]. There is an urgent need to develop an effective, affordable, and long-lasting desalination technology. In recent years, there has been a surge in exploring solar-powered water evaporation owing to its environmentally friendly\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1420. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13081420 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1420 2 of 14\ncharacter [6\u20138]. Unlike bulk-heating-based evaporation, solar-driven interfacial water evaporation can effectively localize thermal energy at the water-air interface, achieving high efficiency of water distillation [9\u201312]. To develop efficient solar-powered interfacial water evaporation, cost-effective photothermal materials with high solar absorption and phototo-thermal conversion are required [11,12]. Several photothermal materials have been reported so far, i.e., metallic nanoparticles, carbon-based materials, wood-based materials, narrow-bandgap semiconductors, and two-dimensional materials [12\u201315]. The use of these materials in a variety of two- and three-dimensional evaporators has resulted in a broad spectrum of water evaporation rates under the same solar irradiation (1 kW m\u22122) [16]. Integrating highly efficient photothermal materials for solar energy harvesting and solar steam generation into various two- or three-dimensional evaporators is the focus of one active area of study at present [17]. To date, several photothermal materials have been engineered to accomplish broadband solar absorption that can conform to global conditions [18]. Transition metal oxides are ubiquitous and have unique physical characteristics and vital uses [19]. The perovskite family is a functionally diverse group of compounds having the chemical formula ABO3 [8]. Typically, alkali or alkali earth metals and transition metals make up the A and B sites, respectively. However, each compound may contain a variety of atoms on the A or B sites functioning as dopants, increasing functional versatility [20]. SrCoO3 is a perovskite oxide and has a perfect perovskite cubic structure with the space group Pm3m, containing alkaline earth metals and transition metals [8]. In SrCoO3, conduction band originates from hybridization of the Co 3d and O 2p orbitals, whereas the O 2s and 4p orbitals are positioned below the conduction band. Redox processes involved in oxygen reduction and evolution on SrCoO3 are heavily controlled by the electronic structure, and are used for energy storage and conversion applications [21\u201323]. SrCoO3 has been investigated for diverse applications, including solar cells [24], sensors [25], electrolyzers [23], and thermochemical water-splitting reactors for H2 production [26], due to its high oxygen permeation flux resulting from its high levels of both ionic and electronic conductivities and improved catalytic activity [21\u201323,26]. The non-stoichiometry of oxygen has a major impact on defining its electronic characteristics. Zhao et al. [27] performed in situ ambient pressure X-ray spectroscopy of SrCoO3 to reveal its electronic structure and to investigate the electronic structure change with its oxygen stoichiometry and phase, which may then be used to explore the development of SrCoO3 for multifunctional applications. Here, we report an efficient solar-driven water harvester that consists of strontiumcobaltite-based perovskite (SrCoO3) anchored on nickel foam (SrCoO3@NF) for fresh water generation. The solar evaporator provides synced water transport and good thermal insulation due to a superhydrophilic polyurethane foam (PU) as a substrate combined with a photothermal layer, as shown in Figure 1. The structural photothermal properties of SrCoO3 perovskite have been extensively investigated through state-of-the-art experimental investigations. Multiple incident rays are induced inside the diffuse surface, allowing omnidirectional solar absorption (91%) and heat localization (42.01 \u25e6C @ 1 sun). Under 1 kW m\u22122 solar intensity, the integrated SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator has an outstanding evaporation rate (1.45 kg/m2 h) and solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency (86.45% excluding heat losses). In addition, long-term evaporation measurements demonstrate small variance under sea water, illustrating its working capacity for salt rejection (1.3 g NaCl/210 min), which is excellent for an efficient solar-driven evaporation application compared to other carbon-based solar evaporators. This research demonstrates substantial capacity for producing fresh water free of salt ions for industrial uses.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1420 3 of 14Nanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a01.\u00a0Schematic\u00a0 illustration\u00a0of\u00a0strontium-cobaltite-based\u00a0perovskite\u00a0(SrCoO3)\u00a0for\u00a0solar-driven\u00a0 interfacial\u00a0evaporation\u00a0systems\u00a0for\u00a0clean\u00a0water\u00a0generation.\u00a0\n2.\u00a0Materials\u00a0and\u00a0Methods\u00a0 2.1.\u00a0Materials\u00a0\nCobalt\u00a0nitrate\u00a0(Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O),\u00a0strontium\u00a0nitrate\u00a0(Sr(NO3)2),\u00a0and\u00a0nickel\u00a0foam\u00a0substrate\u00a0(20\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0cm,\u00a0sheet)\u00a0were\u00a0purchased\u00a0from\u00a0Sinopharm\u00a0Chemical\u00a0Reagent\u00a0Co.\u00a0Ltd.,\u00a0 Beijing,\u00a0China.\u00a0We\u00a0purchased\u00a0polyurethane\u00a0foam\u00a0(C17H16N2O4)\u00a0from\u00a0Changzhou\u00a0Longisland\u00a0Automation\u00a0Technology\u00a0Co.,\u00a0Ltd.,\u00a0Changzhou,\u00a0China.\u00a0All\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0compounds\u00a0maintained\u00a0a\u00a0purity\u00a0level\u00a0of\u00a099.9%\u00a0and\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0require\u00a0additional\u00a0purification.\u00a0Deionized\u00a0water\u00a0 was\u00a0also\u00a0employed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0experimental\u00a0procedure.\u00a0\n2.2.\u00a0Synthesis\u00a0of\u00a0Strontium\u2010Cobaltite\u2010Based\u00a0Perovskite\u00a0(SrCoO3)\u00a0 Cobalt\u00a0nitrate\u00a0(Co(NO3)26H2O),\u00a0and\u00a0strontium\u00a0nitrate\u00a0(Sr(NO3)2)\u00a0were\u00a0mixed\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0so-\nlution\u00a0of\u00a0ethylenediaminetetraacetic\u00a0acid\u00a0(EDTA),\u00a0ammonium\u00a0hydroxide\u00a0(NH4OH),\u00a0and\u00a0 citric\u00a0acid\u00a0(C6H8O7).\u00a0The\u00a0prepared\u00a0mixture\u00a0was\u00a0heated\u00a0at\u00a0260\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0while\u00a0being\u00a0continuously\u00a0 stirred\u00a0in\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0produce\u00a0a\u00a0homogeneous\u00a0gel.\u00a0The\u00a0gel\u00a0was\u00a0allowed\u00a0to\u00a0dry\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0oven\u00a0at\u00a0 200\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0before\u00a0being\u00a0pulverized\u00a0into\u00a0a\u00a0powder.\u00a0The\u00a0SrCoO3\u00a0powder\u00a0was\u00a0then\u00a0exposed\u00a0to\u00a0 air\u00a0and\u00a0heated\u00a0to\u00a01000\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0for\u00a012\u00a0h.\u00a0\n2.3.\u00a0SrCoO3\u2010Coated\u00a0Nickel\u00a0Foam\u00a0Solar\u00a0Evaporator\u00a0 The\u00a0fabrication\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0self-regenerating\u00a0perovskite-material-based\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporator\u00a0 was\u00a0achieved\u00a0using\u00a0a\u00a0simple\u00a0coating\u00a0method.\u00a0A\u00a0specified\u00a0quantity\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0final\u00a0SrCoO3\u00a0 powder\u00a0was\u00a0combined\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0specified\u00a0amount\u00a0of\u00a0terpineol\u00a0(C10H18O),\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0volatile\u00a0 binder,\u00a0to\u00a0form\u00a0a\u00a0homogeneous\u00a0slurry\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0mortar\u00a0pestle.\u00a0The\u00a0nickel\u00a0foam\u00a0(1.6\u00a0mm\u00a0thickness)\u00a0was\u00a0 then\u00a0crafted\u00a0 into\u00a0a\u00a0circular\u00a0shape\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0diameter\u00a0of\u00a0 three\u00a0centimeters\u00a0as\u00a0an\u00a0 interfacial\u00a0layer\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0deposition\u00a0of\u00a0SrCoO3.\u00a0A\u00a0prepared\u00a0homogeneous\u00a0slurry\u00a0of\u00a0photothermal\u00a0material\u00a0was\u00a0deposited\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0nickel\u00a0foam\u00a0using\u00a0a\u00a0commercial\u00a0tool.\u00a0The\u00a0coated\u00a0 nickel\u00a0foam\u00a0was\u00a0then\u00a0dried\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0oven\u00a0overnight\u00a0at\u00a060\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0to\u00a0remove\u00a0the\u00a0terpineol.\u00a0The\u00a0 nickel\u00a0foam\u00a0retained\u00a0good\u00a0hydrophilicity\u00a0and\u00a0microporous\u00a0structure\u00a0after\u00a0drying.\u00a0Finally,\u00a0 the\u00a0SrCoO3\u00a0anchored\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0nickel\u00a0foam\u00a0was\u00a0placed\u00a0over\u00a0the\u00a0PU\u00a0foam\u00a0substrate\u00a0cut\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0 same\u00a0diameter\u00a0as\u00a0 the\u00a0nickel\u00a0 foam\u00a0 to\u00a0 impart\u00a0floatability\u00a0with\u00a0good\u00a0water\u00a0 transport\u00a0and\u00a0 minimum\u00a0thermal\u00a0conductivity.\u00a0Overall,\u00a0the\u00a0fabrication\u00a0was\u00a0simple,\u00a0repeatable,\u00a0readily\u00a0 installable,\u00a0and\u00a0self-contained\u00a0for\u00a0usage\u00a0in\u00a0any\u00a0location.\u00a0\nigure 1.

The SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator was allowed to float freely on the water surface in a beaker (simulated sea water). The entire system was then placed on an advanced electronic balance (Mettler Toledo, ME204, the Strategy, Singapore) with a resolution of 0.001 g, which recorded the time-dependent mass variation to determine the evaporation rate, and exposed under simulated solar radiation (1 kW m\u22122 or one sun). After the stabilization of the evaporation system, the evaporation rates and optimized evaporation (solar to vapor conversion efficiency) were evaluated under one sun illumination (1 kW m\u22122). Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer Optima 8000, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to compare the salt concentrations before and after the water was treated.

Crystallographic, elemental, and morphological analysis of the SrCoO3 powder was carried out via microscopic techniques, i.e., X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The XRD pattern of the perovskite SrCoO3 powder is shown in Figure 2a. All the diffraction peaks are positioned at the Bragg\u2019s angle: 2\u03b8 = 18.62\u25e6, 28.65\u25e6, 32.63\u25e6, 44.03, 55.76, 58.27\u25e6, and 68.40\u25e6, corresponding to the (310), (110), (102), (112), (004), (212), (114), and (220) index planes, respectively, which is in good correspondence with previously reported data [28]. The XRD analysis reveals the formation of the tetragonal crystalline phase of the synthesized SrCoO3 powder. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to provide insight into the elemental and chemical composition of the SrCoO3. Figure 2b shows the full XPS survey of the SrCoO3, showing the existence of several elements, i.e., Co2p, O1s, C1s, Sr3p, and Sr 3d, respectively. The highly resolved XPS spectrum of Co2p is demonstrated in Figure 2c, which has two splits into two distinct peaks due to the two spin-orbit doublets of the cobalt oxides positioned at 780.02 and 795.04 eV, corresponding to the Co 2p (1/2) and Co2p (3/2), respectively. The Co 2p (1/2) spin-orbit doublet is further deconvoluted into two sub-peaks located at 779.54 and 780.69 eV, assigned to the Co3+ 2p (1/2) and Co2+ 2p (1/2) configurations, respectively, while the Co 2p (3/2) spin-orbit doublet is further split into three distinct peaks at 794.67, 796.08, and 796.80 eV, attributed to the Co3+ 2p (3/2) and Co2+ 2p (3/2), respectively [8].

The C1s spectrum of SrCoO3 shows two main peaks, while three sub-peaks appear at 289.05, 284.32, and 284.53 eV, corresponding to the O\u2013C=O, C\u2013C, and C\u2013O bonds, respectively, as shown in\nFigure 2e. The presence of various functional groups in SrCoO3 was identified by performing Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Figure 2f demonstrates the FTIR spectrum of perovskite SrCoO3, revealing metal oxide (Sr\u2013O, Co\u2013O) bands with different vibration modes. The Co\u2013O exhibits different vibrational modes ascribed to its different valences, Co2+, Co3+, and Co4+, with bands at the 591.96 cm\u22121 asymmetric vibrational modes of the tetrahedrally coordinated valence (Co2+) and octahedrally coordinated valence (Co3+). The assigned absorbance bands at 858 cm\u22121 and 1450 cm\u22121 show the existence of the carbonate in the specimen, and correspond to the twisting and vibration, respectively. The band at 855.39 cm\u22121 is due to the twisting and stretching of carbonate, revealing the presence of carbonate in the material. The other bands, 1000 to 3000 cm\u22121, are mainly due to the M\u2013O and M\u2013O\u2013M type vibrational modes (M=Sr, Co) [28]. The band at 1386.20 cm\u22121 corresponds to C\u2013O\u2013C type stretching, while the band at 3443.95 is due to OH stretching."

The FESEM image of the SrCoO3 anchored on nickel foam (NF) is shown in Figure 3d, showing the highly porous structure of the NF, which facilitates simple water transport and hinders salt resistance. The SrCoO3 is uniformly deposited on the walls of the NF, with which imparts a dense texture due to the homogeneously dispersed SrCoO3 nanoparticles. This rough, dense morphology facilitates the development of an effective photothermal layer and helps to attain high surface temperatures because of the absorbed solar energy that is converted to heat at the top contact, rather than being allowed to freely diffuse downward into the bulk water."

The optical absorption of the SrCoO3 was analyzed using UV-Vis spectroscopy in an integrated sphere over the full solar spectrum range (200\u20132500 nm). The absorption spectrum of the SrCoO3 is shown in Figure 4a. The SrCoO3 perovskite oxide exhibits enhanced absorption at up to 91% of the entire solar spectrum and reflects just 5%. Its superior absorption assists efficient solar-driven steam generation due to the material\u2019s rough black surface.

(d\u2013i) Time-dependent IR images of SrCoO3@NF under 1 sun illumination.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1420 8 of 14\nThe enhanced surface temperature of the SrCoO3@NF enabled maximum solar harvest, high heat localization inside the top photothermal layer, and outstanding thermal management using hydrophilic PU foam, which allows water transportation only up to the top surface, preventing downward thermal conduction. Therefore, the photothermal layer achieved a peak temperature of 42.21 \u25e6C, allowing for a rapid evaporation rate and improved efficiency. This enhanced surface temperature permits the rapid generation of steam, which eventually results in high photothermal conversion efficiency. The surface temperature of SrCoO3@NF was measured under multiple sun intensities. At higher solar intensities, the surface temperature of SrCoO3@NF is raised, reaching a maximum of 54.2 \u25e6C under 3 kW m\u22122 irradiation (Figure 4c). The interfacial thermal accumulation response of SrCoO3@NF under 1 kW m\u22122 was also captured using an infrared (IR) camera, as shown in Figure 4d\u2013i. As expected, the SrCoO3@NF temperature reached 29.5 \u25e6C after 10 min, indicating a fast photothermal response. The creation of thermal localization during evaporation was facilitated by the synergistic impact of the anisotropic low thermal conductivity of SrCoO3@NF and the high photothermal conversion of the perovskite material SrCoO3. After 25 min of irradiation at a steady 1 kW m\u22122, the SrCoO3@NF reached a surface temperature of 41.2 \u25e6C. The improved interfacial heat accumulation capability of the SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator is responsible for the rapid and dramatic increase in temperature. The rough, dense surface texture of the interfacial photothermal layer of perovskite SrCoO3 anchored on NF enables effective thermal localization by inherently dispersing incident solar intensity at the interface, which is the fundamental mechanism of the interfacial solar evaporation structure. We performed a comparative investigation of the four designed systems, i.e., pure water, PU foam, NF@PU, and SrCoO3@NF-based solar evaporators, to record evaporation performance under 1 kW m\u22122 solar intensity for 1 h. As expected, high surface temperature enabled fast evaporation and a high evaporation rate. The SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator attained a maximum evaporation rate of up to 1.45 kg m\u22122 h\u22121, significantly higher than the other evaporation systems, i.e., pure water (0.32 kg m\u22122 h\u22121), PU foam (0.72 kg m\u22122 h\u22121), and NF@PU (1.08 kg m\u22122 h\u22121), as shown in Figure 5a. The evaporation rate of the self-regenerating SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator was also recorded under multiple solar intensities. A maximum evaporation rate of up to 4.06 kg m\u22122 h\u22121 was recorded under 3 k W m\u22122, as shown in Figure 5b. The total efficiency of the solar-powered evaporation system can be optimized by good thermal management of the overall system. In order to design efficient heat accumulation for an effective solar-driven evaporation system, hydrophilic PU foam, which demonstrates high thermal insulation, is used. Here, a thermal conductivity meter (Hot Disk AB, TPS 2500, Sweden) was used to experimentally measure the thermal parameters of the manufactured solar-driven evaporation system. As soon as the power is turned on, a vertical sequence of temperature gradients (dT/dx) is created. The permeation heat transmission rate (q) via the SrCoO3@NF system can be found with the use of Fourier Equations (3) and (4) [4], as shown below:\nq = \u2212k1 dT dx = \u2212k1 T2 \u2212 T1 x2 \u2212 x1\n(3)\nwhere k1 is the thermal conductivity constant (1.05 W m\u22121 K\u22121) [4], x1 is the glass slide thickness (3 mm), x2 is the SrCoO3@NF thickness (30 mm), T1 is the temperature of the heating interface, T2 is the temperature of the bottom glass of the SrCoO3@NF, and T3 is the temperature of the top glass of SrCoO3@NF. Given the heat transfer rate and the temperature gradient at thermal equilibrium in the material, the thermal conductivity (k) of SrCoO3@NF can be calculated using Equation (4) [4]:\nk = q x2\nT3 \u2212 T2 (4)\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1420 9 of 14Nanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 10\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a05.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Evaporation\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0four\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporators\u00a0under\u00a01\u00a0kW\u00a0m\u22122.\u00a0(b)\u00a0Evaporation\u00a0rate\u00a0profile\u00a0\nof\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporator\u00a0under\u00a0multiple\u00a0solar\u00a0irradiations.\u00a0(c)\u00a0Thermal\u00a0conductivity\u00a0meas-\nurement\u00a0of\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporator.\u00a0 (d,e)\u00a0Real-time\u00a0demonstration\u00a0of\u00a0vapor\u00a0generation\u00a0and\u00a0\nrespective\u00a0IR\u00a0images\u00a0under\u00a02\u00a0sun\u00a0irradiations\u00a0of\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporator.\u00a0(f)\u00a0Comparative\u00a0so-\nlar-to-vapor\u00a0conversion\u00a0efficiencies\u00a0of\u00a0four\u00a0evaporating\u00a0systems.\u00a0(g)\u00a0Number\u00a0of\u00a0washing\u00a0cycles\u00a0vs.\u00a0\nevaporation\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporator.\u00a0\nTable\u00a01.\u00a0Comparison\u00a0of\u00a0solar-driven\u00a0evaporation\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0with\u00a0other\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporators.\u00a0\nSr.\u00a0No\u00a0 Solar\u00a0Driven\u00a0System\u00a0 Evaporation\u00a0Rate\u00a0 (Kg\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121)\u00a0 Efficiency\u00a0(%)\u00a0 Ref.\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 Carbon-black-coated\u00a0polymethylmethacrylate\u00a0(PMMA)\u00a0 layer,\u00a0(CB/PMMA)\u00a0\n1.3\u00a0 72\u00a0 [29]\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Fe3O4-coated\u00a0delignified\u00a0wood\u00a0(Fe-D-Wood)\u00a0 1.3\u00a0 73\u00a0 [30]\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Graphene\u00a0oxide/cellulose\u00a0ester\u00a0membrane\u00a0(GO/MCE)\u00a0 1.3\u00a0 86\u00a0 [31]\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Carbonized\u00a0pencil\u00a0waste\u00a0evaporator\u00a0 1.2\u00a0 82.2\u00a0 [32]\u00a0 5.\u00a0 In\u00a0situ\u00a0alkalized\u00a03D\u00a0carbon\u00a0foam\u00a0(CF)\u00a0 1.26\u00a0 80.1\u00a0 [33]\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Black\u00a0sand\u00a0 1.43\u00a0 81\u00a0 [34]\u00a0\n3.4.\u00a0Salt\u2010Rejection\u00a0Ability\u00a0 The\u00a0desalination\u00a0of\u00a0saltwater\u00a0uses\u00a0solar\u00a0energy,\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0renewable\u00a0and\u00a0non-polluting\u00a0energy\u00a0source.\u00a0Nevertheless,\u00a0during\u00a0prolonged\u00a0operation\u00a0in\u00a0cooler\u00a0temperatures,\u00a0 the\u00a0water\u00a0channels\u00a0of\u00a0evaporation\u00a0structures\u00a0tend\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0obstructed\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0high\u00a0salt\u00a0 content\u00a0of\u00a0sea\u00a0water\u00a0(3.5\u00a0wt%\u00a0NaCl).\u00a0The\u00a0optimization\u00a0of\u00a0evaporation\u00a0efficiency\u00a0 is\u00a0ultimately\u00a0stifled\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0result\u00a0of\u00a0salt\u00a0accumulation.\u00a0Many\u00a0effective\u00a0methods\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0proposed\u00a0to\u00a0address\u00a0this\u00a0problem,\u00a0such\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0 introduction\u00a0of\u00a0 innovative\u00a0thin\u00a0evaporation\u00a0 structures\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0expense\u00a0of\u00a0thermal\u00a0insulation.\u00a0These\u00a0delicate\u00a0evaporation\u00a0structures\u00a0let\u00a0 heat\u00a0escape\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0top\u00a0interfacial\u00a0heating\u00a0layer\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0bulk\u00a0water\u00a0below.\u00a0The\u00a0salt-rejection\u00a0and\u00a0self-regeneration\u00a0ability\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0solar-driven\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0evaporation\u00a0structure\u00a0 developed\u00a0 here\u00a0 were\u00a0 investigated\u00a0 through\u00a0 different\u00a0 experimental\u00a0 procedures.\u00a0 The\u00a0 SrCoO3@NF\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporator\u00a0was\u00a0placed\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0beaker\u00a0filled\u00a0with\u00a0simulated\u00a0sea\u00a0water\u00a0(3.5\u00a0 wt%\u00a0NaCl)\u00a0and\u00a0operated\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0long\u00a0period\u00a0of\u00a0time\u00a0at\u00a01\u00a0sun\u00a0solar\u00a0intensity\u00a0(1\u00a0kW\u00a0m\u22122)\u00a0while\u00a0\nFigure 5.

The high interfacial heat accumulation and superior solar-tovapor conversion efficiency are the results of optimal solar absorption and minimal thermal conduction. A r al-time demonstration of the SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator producing vapor under 2 kW m\u22122 intensity is shown in Figure 5d. Figure 5e shows a corresponding infrared picture of a SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator operating under 2 sun conditions, revealing a heated interfacial surface with no thermal conduction, which is ideal for a fast evaporation rate in support of effective saltwater desalination. The hydrophilic PU foam effectively limits produced heat, and the infrared picture shows how the interfacial heat buildup is increased over the top matrix and shows effective thermal management compared to existing solar evaporators. The comparative solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of the pure water, PU foam, NF@PU, and SrCoO3@NF were calculated as shown in Figure 5f. The self-regenerating SrCoO3@NF had the highest evaporation efficiency, at 86.45%, higher than the pure water (18.22%), PU foam (38.96%), or NF@PU (61.22%). Table 1 represents a comparison with other solar evaporators. Furthermore, the antifouling properties of the SrCoO3@NF were assessed by calculating the number of washing cycles as a function of the evaporation rate, as shown in Figure 5g. The SrCoO3@NF maintains smooth evaporation rates with little variation, showing excellent scalabilit for long-term efficacy."

Self-regenerating and salt-resistant performance of SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator. (a\u2013h) Solid NaCl powder (1.3 g) was placed on the top surface of the SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator and dissolved in an open porous assembly within 210 min. under 1 kW m\u22122 solar intensity.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1420 11 of 14\nIn steady-state evaporation conditions, the SrCoO3@NF evaporating structure demonstrated exceptional self-regenerating potential by rejecting all of the 1.3 g of solid NaCl in 3.5 h of constant irradiation. The highly porous and interconnected network of the heating and the insulating interface is responsible for the salt rejection and regeneration potential of the designed system. The superwetting feature of microchannels, enhanced by a crosslinking of the interfaces in a centralized macropore arrangement, allows rapid evaporation and simultaneous water transport. Salt ions are transported from a high-concentration to a low-concentration location via diffusion or convection due to the potential gradient caused by the two regions\u2019 varying concentrations. A constant flow of vapor dissolves the solid NaCl, allowing it to migrate through the photothermal layer and into the bulk water below. The SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator\u2019s open porous assembly is oriented so that salt does not build up within. Hence, the designed system offers promising potential for industrial-level applicability for sea water desalination. The developed SrCoO3@NF self-regenerating solar evaporation system shows excellent photothermal conversion, quick water transfer, and fast vapor escape, which offers a potentially useful approach to efficient, effective, and long-term production of fresh water with little impact on the environment. Several brine solutions, including pure water at 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt%, were also used to test the SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator\u2019s salt-resistance potential without reducing evaporation rates. As shown in Figure 7a, the developed evaporation system performance is not affected by a high salt content, and even higher salt concentrations do not significantly affect the evaporation rate. Furthermore, we investigated the cycle stability of the SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator by consistently operating it over 5 cycles under one solar intensity, as shown in Figure 7b. The SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator showed no significant change in its evaporation rate. This suggests that the system can be used for a very long time as an efficient solar-driven water evaporation system. However, evaporation structures have several challenges, the most prominent of which is mechanical fragility and structural deformation when operated consistently over a long time period, which has a major impact on the evaporation rate and efficiency of devices. As can be seen in Figure 7c, in order to examine mechanical steadiness and consistency in evaporation efficiency, the SrCoO3@NF system was run continuously for 8 h. In simulated saltwater conditions and 1 kW m\u22122 sun intensity, the self-regenerating LSCF@NFP was able to maintain a smooth evaporation rate with little discrepancy, demonstrating great scalability for long-term effectiveness. Additionally, Figure 7d shows the results of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurement of the concentration of four primary salt ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) in stimulated sea water and condensed water, which was performed to evaluate the purifying potential of the developed system. After desalination, the concentration of salt ions drops by three to four orders of magnitude, far below the standards for drinking water of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Hence, the SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator optimally produces potable fresh water, expanding its potential industrial applications.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1420 12 of 14\nNanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 12\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nsystem.\u00a0However,\u00a0evaporation\u00a0structures\u00a0have\u00a0several\u00a0challenges,\u00a0the\u00a0most\u00a0prominent\u00a0of\u00a0 which\u00a0is\u00a0mechanical\u00a0fragility\u00a0and\u00a0structural\u00a0deformation\u00a0when\u00a0operated\u00a0consistently\u00a0over\u00a0 a\u00a0long\u00a0time\u00a0period,\u00a0which\u00a0has\u00a0a\u00a0major\u00a0impact\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0evaporation\u00a0rate\u00a0and\u00a0efficiency\u00a0of\u00a0 devices.\u00a0As\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0seen\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a07c,\u00a0in\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0examine\u00a0mechanical\u00a0steadiness\u00a0and\u00a0consistency\u00a0in\u00a0evaporation\u00a0efficiency,\u00a0the\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0system\u00a0was\u00a0run\u00a0continuously\u00a0for\u00a08\u00a0h.\u00a0 In\u00a0 simulated\u00a0 saltwater\u00a0 conditions\u00a0 and\u00a0 1\u00a0 kW\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0 sun\u00a0 intensity,\u00a0 the\u00a0 self-regenerating\u00a0 LSCF@NFP\u00a0was\u00a0 able\u00a0 to\u00a0maintain\u00a0 a\u00a0 smooth\u00a0 evaporation\u00a0 rate\u00a0with\u00a0 little\u00a0 discrepancy,\u00a0 demonstrating\u00a0great\u00a0scalability\u00a0for\u00a0long-term\u00a0effectiveness.\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0Figure\u00a07d\u00a0shows\u00a0 the\u00a0results\u00a0of\u00a0inductively\u00a0coupled\u00a0plasma-optical\u00a0emission\u00a0spectrometry\u00a0(ICP-OES)\u00a0measurement\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0concentration\u00a0of\u00a0four\u00a0primary\u00a0salt\u00a0ions\u00a0(Na+,\u00a0K+,\u00a0Ca2+,\u00a0Mg2+)\u00a0in\u00a0stimulated\u00a0 sea\u00a0water\u00a0and\u00a0condensed\u00a0water,\u00a0which\u00a0was\u00a0performed\u00a0to\u00a0evaluate\u00a0the\u00a0purifying\u00a0potential\u00a0 of\u00a0the\u00a0developed\u00a0system.\u00a0After\u00a0desalination,\u00a0the\u00a0concentration\u00a0of\u00a0salt\u00a0ions\u00a0drops\u00a0by\u00a0three\u00a0 to\u00a0 four\u00a0orders\u00a0of\u00a0magnitude,\u00a0 far\u00a0below\u00a0 the\u00a0standards\u00a0 for\u00a0drinking\u00a0water\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0World\u00a0 Health\u00a0Organization\u00a0(WHO)\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0US\u00a0Environmental\u00a0Protection\u00a0Agency\u00a0(EPA).\u00a0Hence,\u00a0 the\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporator\u00a0optimally\u00a0produces\u00a0potable\u00a0fresh\u00a0water,\u00a0expanding\u00a0its\u00a0 potential\u00a0industrial\u00a0applications.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a07.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Evaporation\u00a0rates\u00a0of\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporator\u00a0under\u00a0different\u00a0salt\u00a0concentration\u00a0 solutions.\u00a0(b)\u00a0Cyclic\u00a0stability\u00a0of\u00a0evaporation\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporator\u00a0over\u00a05\u00a0consecutive\u00a0 cycles.\u00a0(c)\u00a0Long-term\u00a0operational\u00a0stability\u00a0of\u00a0SrCoO3@NF\u00a0solar\u00a0evaporator\u00a0for\u00a08\u00a0h\u00a0continuously.\u00a0(d)\u00a0 Inductively\u00a0coupled\u00a0plasma-optical\u00a0emission\u00a0spectrometry\u00a0(ICP-OES)\u00a0examination\u00a0of\u00a0concentration\u00a0 gradient\u00a0of\u00a0primary\u00a0salt\u00a0ions\u00a0in\u00a0simulated\u00a0sea\u00a0water\u00a0(20\u00a0wt%)\u00a0and\u00a0condensed\u00a0water.\u00a0\n4.\u00a0Conclusions\u00a0 In\u00a0 summary,\u00a0 we\u00a0 successfully\u00a0 synthesized\u00a0 strontium-cobaltite-based\u00a0 perovskite\u00a0 (SrCoO3)\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0via\u00a0the\u00a0sol-gel\u00a0technique.\u00a0A\u00a0detailed\u00a0structural\u00a0investigation\u00a0was\u00a0 performed\u00a0to\u00a0fabricate\u00a0a\u00a0solar-driven\u00a0water\u00a0harvester\u00a0composed\u00a0of\u00a0strontium-cobaltitebased\u00a0perovskite\u00a0(SrCoO3)\u00a0anchored\u00a0on\u00a0nickel\u00a0foam\u00a0(SrCoO3@NF).\u00a0Synced\u00a0water\u00a0transport\u00a0 and\u00a0good\u00a0thermal\u00a0insulation\u00a0are\u00a0provided\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0superhydrophilic\u00a0polyurethane\u00a0substrate\u00a0\nti t s f 3@NF solar evaporator under different salt concentration solutions.

            "text": "In summary, we successfully synthesized strontium-cobaltite-based perovskite (SrCoO3) nanoparticles via the sol-gel technique. A detailed structural investigation was performed to fabricate a solar-driven water harvester composed of strontium-cobaltite-based perovskite (SrCoO3) anchored on nickel foam (SrCoO3@NF). Synced water transport and good thermal insulation are provided by a superhydrophilic polyurethane substrate combined with a photothermal layer. Multiple incident rays are induced inside the diffuse surface, allowing omnidirectional solar absorption (91%) and heat localization (42.01 \u25e6C @ 1 sun). Under 1 kW m2 solar intensity, the integrated SrCoO3@NF solar evaporator has an outstanding evaporation rate (1.45 kg/m2 h) and solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency (86.45% excluding heat losses). In addition, long-term evaporation measurements demonstrate low variance under sea water, illustrating the system\u2019s working capacity for salt rejection (1.3 g NaCl/210 min). This research demonstrates a substantial capacity to produce fresh water free of salt ions for industrial uses.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.H. and Q.L.; methodology, M.H.; software, Y.L.; validation, M.S.I., M.Y. and N.A.; formal analysis, M.A. (Muneerah Alomar); investigation, A.S.A.; resources, M.H.; data curation, M.S.I.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.A. (Muhammad Akbar); visualization, Y.L.; supervision, Q.L.; project administration, Q.L.; funding acquisition, Q.L. and M.A. (Muhammad Akbar).
