    "abstractText": "Soft robotics technology has several technical benefits and enables inherently safer human-robot interaction (HRI). However, only few studies have addressed how people experience soft robots and how their embodiment and designs can meaningfully support HRI. The present study explores impressions formed in the physical meeting with soft robots. 94 participants interacted with one out of two soft robots or a similar traditional robot. Following interaction, they were asked what they thought the robot resembled and to describe the robot\u2019s appearance using five adjectives. The results show that different categories of items were used to describe each of the three robots\u2019 resemblances. Furthermore, a significant difference in the sentiment of the adjectives used was found \u2014 positive adjectives were predominantly used to describe the two soft robots, whereas there was an overweight of negative adjectives for the traditional robot.",

            "text": "Soft robots are systems capable of autonomous behavior composed of materials with elastic moduli similar to those of soft biological materials [14]. Soft robotics has received increasing attention within the past decades, as the technology possesses several technical benefits, including ease of control, increased adaptability, and improved energy efficiency. Soft robots are equally claimed to offer inherently safer interactions with humans, as passive compliance and mechanical impedance matching ensures a reduction in the harm that a robot might inadvertently cause to a human [13]. Soft robots have a radically different visual appearance than traditional\nrobots and share haptic similarities with biological organisms. However, at present, only few publications have addressed how people experience soft robots and how their designs can support intuitive interaction with a user. As a robot\u2019s appearance and embodiment have been shown to influence joint task performance, perception of its abilities, and emergent interaction, more knowledge is needed about how people perceive soft robots and how the impression they provide modulates human-robot interaction (HRI). The present study addresses this lack by exploring which associations and impressions that are formed in the meeting with a soft robot. More specifically, it interrogates what adjectives people use to describe a soft robot\u2019s appearance, what the emotional valence of these adjectives is, and what people think a soft robot resembles. To elucidate the uniqueness of the impressions soft robots give off, two different soft robots are compared using a traditional robot with a similar overall shape and an identical interaction behavior as a baseline."

            "text": "Few prior studies have sought to elucidate people\u2019s perceptions of soft robots and how these modulate various aspects of HRI. In an interaction design study, two soft robotic prototypes were presented as potential near-future artificial pets [2]. However, these prototypes \"invited a plurality of associations\u201d, and were variously described as resembling gadgets, consumer products, hospital or laboratory equipment by participants in the study. Moreover, the \u201cbreathing\u201d motion of the robot prototypes, resulting from pneumatic actuation, were found to be central to impressions of the prototypes as being \"alive\". An online study that used CAD video animations as stimuli, found that adding an inflating soft robotic sleeve to a cobot arm led to an increase in warmth rating, in a visualized handover task [12]. However, another study found that soft robots were not considered more natural or appealing in comparison with a traditional robot [10]. Yet, the soft robots elicited different interaction behaviors from users, specifically relating to touch and perceived safety. The haptic qualities and movements of soft robots have also been found to be more appealing than their looks [9]. It has also been demonstrated that specific emotional states (including arousal and pleasure) can be communicated to a human user by having a soft robot perform breath-like motions at different frequencies [11]. Similarly, in [4] it was shown that a pneumatically actuated soft robot could convey specific emotional states, actions, and patterns to users through its movement and gestures. Furthermore, the researchers found that their soft social robot was perceived as animal-like, resembling a sea creature or as similar to specific body parts and organs (lungs, heart, belly). Lastly, it has been shown that touching a soft robot that performs\nbreath-like motions, can result in brain patterns indicative of higher arousal compared to a baseline of no robot motion [1]."

The red robot and the blue robot platforms are pneumatically actuated threechambered silicone tentacles mounted on aluminum frames capable of movement in all directions. They incorporate low noise electrical pumps (MITSUMI R-14 A213), solenoid valves (Uxcell Fa0520D 6V), an Arduino Pro Mini microcontroller, and H-bridge chips (L292D) for actuation and control. Two different soft robotic tentacles were used in the study to allow for comparison of whether soft robotic tentacles with differing aesthetic designs would be perceived and described differently. The red robot is slightly softer than the blue robot and expands towards the sides with bulges emerging near the top upon inflation. The fiber reinforcements added inside the blue tentacle, by contrast, ensure an efficient elongation without any radial expansion and more pronounced sideways movement (cf. Fig. 1). The rigid robot platform, used as a baseline, is an arm like morphology assembled from five servo motors (TowerPro SG90) and brackets from the Open Source modular system REPY-2.0 3D printed in white PLA."

When reaching the hand, the gently presses against it for 6 seconds, and then returns to its initial position.\nThe two interaction modes are intended to approximate semiautonomous robot behavior in a use case where the robot would likely perform some tasks autonomously, but the user would be able to guide or control its overal behavior (e.g., a joint work task with a cobot). Identical actuation systems and programming were used to control the red robot and the blue robot in the experiment. The rigid robot also used the same program, but with the movements reprogrammed to be accomplished by its servo motors. It was confirmed empirically that the force delivered from each robot to ones hand was of approximately the same magnitude for all robots."

Word association methods have been used in psychology and social science research and argued to be efficient for gaining access to spontaneous mental representations formed in response to specific stimuli [7].

Text mining tools (R Statistics with the tm() package) were used to extract the sentiment of the adjectives listed by each participant (distributions for each condition are visualized in Fig. 3). The entries were first cleaned - punctuation, special characters, numbers, and stop words were removed. Stemming and white space removal was performed. Lastly, sentiment analysis was carried out using the syuzhet method [8], a lexicon-based method wherein each word can be assigned 8 emotions and positive or negative emotional valence. The syuzhetmethodwas applied on thewhole entry of adjectives for each participant. Fig. 3 shows the results of the sentiment analysis for each experiment condition. The method was used to calculate an overall emotional valence score for each participant by assigning the value 1 to positive words, -1 to negative words, and 0 to neutral words and summing the values for all words in their entry. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the experiment condition (i.e. robot interacted with) had a statistically significant effect on the overall emotional valence score for the adjectives used to describe the robot F(2; 91) = 3.8; p = 0.026). Post Hoc analysis (Tukey HSD) showed that the mean value for the rigid robot (M: -0.50, SD: 0.93) was significantly different (p=0.030) from the mean value for the red robot (M: 0.13, SD: 1.04) and trend level significantly different (p=0.071) from the mean value for the blue robot (M: 0.14, SD: 0.83)."

            "heading": "4.2 What Do the Robots Resemble?",
            "text": "To explore the replies to the question \"What does the robot resemble?\", the method of building affinity diagrams was used. This method is used in design processes to consolidate qualitative data by clustering related items into themes emergent from data [5, 6]. The diagrams were conducted in a Microsoft Word document by moving text items under cluster headings. All responses were compiled in a single document. Several participants listed more than one item, hence the decision was made to treat each individual item mentioned by a participant as a distinct data item and to categorize the items individually. This yielded a total of 131 items within the replies obtained from 94 participants. To cluster the items into categories all items were read through. As many entries mentioned specific animals or animal body parts, the category \u201canimal\u201d was first established. Following the affinity diagram method, additional categories were created by asking for each item if it would fit within any of the established headings, or if a new category was needed. A few items specifically referenced human body parts, so a category called \u201chuman\u201d was added. A high number of body parts were mentioned without any specification of whether they were animal or human, hence, the category \u201corganism\u201d was created to contain these. Most remaining items could be categorized as either synthetic (materials and objects) or organic (materials and objects). The last remaining 4 items were classified as \u201cother\u201d. The items thus categorized were distributed as shown in Fig. 4.\nTo further study the entries of the two categories where the three robots had the highest number of items (the columns \u201canimal\u201d\nand the columns \u201corganism\u201d), these two categories were subdivided into four subcategories \u2013 \u201canimal\u201d, \u201canimal body part\u201d, \u201corganism\u201d, and \u201cpart of an organism\u201d (Fig. 5.). Items contained within these four subcategories account for 76% of the total items (99 out of 131). Fig. 5 shows that 41% percent of all entries for the red robot state that it resembles a part of an organism, without any specification pertaining to human or animal. Specific mentions here included arm, lung, penis, a muscle, \u201ca piece of loose skin\u201d, trachea, small intestine, vein, and \u201cintestinal section\u201d. For the blue robot, 39% of all entries can be categorized as \u201canimal body part\u201d, with two body parts mentioned more than once \u2013 an elephant\u2019s trunk (N=10) and a tentacle (N=3). For the rigid robot, 47% percent of entries state that it resembles a whole animal, with the three top mentions being snake (N=7), larva (N=4), and worm (N=4)."

            "heading": "5 DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Participants were found to use words of both positive and negative valence when describing the soft robots. On the contrary, they predominantly used adjectives with negative emotional valence to describe the rigid robot (Fig. 3). Statistical analysis confirmed that indeed there was a significant difference between mean overall valence score for the rigid robot and the red robot and a trend level difference between the rigid and the blue robot, with a negative mean value for the rigid robot and a positive mean value for both soft robots. The tendency to use negative words to describe the rigid robot is worthy of further study. Familiarity could provide part of the explanation: Participants may be more familiar with traditional robots and hence expect more from them than from soft robots, which they may not have encountered before. If these expectations are not met, this may lead to disappointment reflected in negative word usage. This, however, might only account partially for the finding, as a large proportion of participants had no prior robot interaction experience. The distribution of sentiment for the two soft robotic tentacles in Fig. 3 are visually very similar - both have a slightly higher proportion of positive than negative valence and have disgust, joy, and anticipation as the most prevalent emotions. The sentiments scores for the rigid robot, by contrast, have a more level distribution between the 8 emotions and a negative score that is more than double the positive score. The more pronounced spiking in disgust, joy, and anticipation for the two soft robots, could indicate that the soft robots are experienced as both more disgusting and more exciting due to their more organic qualities.\nThe exploration of written responses concerning what the robots resemble revealed that the subcategories with most items for the three robots were \u201cpart of an organism\u201d (red robot), \u201canimal body part\u201d (blue robot), and \u201canimal\u201d (rigid robot). This is surprising, as one might expect the soft robots to be said to resemble animals/animal body parts more often than the rigid robot, due to their more organic qualities. However, the rigid robot did have relatively more entries in the \u201csynthetic\u201d category (Fig. 4). The categorization of the written responses reveals possible trends for how participants attributed different uses to each robot. The red robot was often said to resemble internal body parts. By contrast, the blue robot was said to resemble external parts of an animal (e.g., an elephant\u2019s trunk and a tentacle). This difference could be a result of their different color. But it could also reflect that the the blue\nrobot has more pronounced movement, and might appear more purpose-driven and reminiscent of movement involved in manipulation tasks. Finally, the rigid robot was most often said to resemble an entire animal, possibly indicating that this morphology is, to some degree, perceived as being both autonomous and complete.\nThe three major categories of resemblances could potentially serve as input for robot designers, as they imply specific behaviors and usages such as close or interior contact with the body, manipulation of objects, and, in the case of the rigid robot, independent behavior. Aligning a robot\u2019s design with its corresponding function could make it easier to intuit the robot\u2019s purpose, and how to interact with it."
