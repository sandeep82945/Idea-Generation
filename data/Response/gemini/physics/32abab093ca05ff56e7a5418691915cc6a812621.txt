1. **Investigate the use of glycopolymers for the targeted delivery of antiviral drugs.** Glycopolymers could be used to deliver antiviral drugs specifically to infected cells, thereby reducing the risk of side effects and improving the efficacy of treatment.


2. **Develop glycopolymers that can inhibit the attachment of viruses to host cells.** This could be achieved by designing glycopolymers that mimic the structure of the host cell receptors that the virus uses to attach.


3. **Explore the use of glycopolymers for the development of vaccines.** Glycopolymers could be used to present antigens to the immune system in a way that triggers a strong immune response. This could lead to the development of more effective vaccines against a wide range of viruses.


4. **Investigate the use of glycopolymers for the detection of viruses.** Glycopolymers could be used to develop biosensors that can detect the presence of viruses in a sample. This could be used for the rapid diagnosis of viral infections.


5. **Explore the use of glycopolymers for the development of antiviral coatings.** Glycopolymers could be used to develop coatings that can prevent viruses from attaching to surfaces. This could be used to protect surfaces from contamination with viruses, such as in hospitals and other healthcare settings.
