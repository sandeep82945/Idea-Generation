1. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between (Z)-2-lachnophyllum ester (EZ) and the proteins ERK1, JNK1, p38α MAPK, NF-κB (p50/p65), and PKB/AKT.** This could be done using techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays. This information could be used to develop new therapeutic strategies for melanoma.


2. **Evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of CBEO in a melanoma mouse model.** This would involve administering CBEO to mice bearing melanoma tumors and monitoring tumor growth and survival. This information would provide further evidence for the potential of CBEO as a treatment for melanoma.


3. **Investigate the effects of CBEO on other types of cancer cells.** This could be done by testing CBEO against a panel of cancer cell lines representing different tumor types. This information would help to determine the broad-spectrum antitumor activity of CBEO.


4. **Explore the potential of CBEO to overcome drug resistance in melanoma.** This could be done by testing CBEO in combination with other drugs that are commonly used to treat melanoma. This information could lead to the development of new combination therapies that are more effective than single-agent therapy.


5. **Investigate the potential of CBEO to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy for melanoma.** This could be done by testing CBEO in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are a type of immunotherapy that has shown promise in the treatment of melanoma. This information could lead to the development of new combination therapies that are more effective than either monotherapy alone.
