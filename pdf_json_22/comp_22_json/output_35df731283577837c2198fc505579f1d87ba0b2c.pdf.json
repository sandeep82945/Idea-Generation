            "text": "Gliomas are the most common neuroepithelial brain tumors, different by various biological tissue types and prognosis. A widely used classification of central nervous system tumors shaped by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2007 was based on histogenesis and microscopic similarities of neoplasms [4]. According to the 2007 WHO classification, gliomas are graded with four levels [4]. WHO grades I-II are typically referred by experts to low-grade gliomas (LGG), WHO grades III-IV \u2013 to high-grade (HGG). This classification was revisited in 2016: the new system appeared more complex and relied on molecular subtypes associated with treatment outcomes [5]. Despite the rationale behind the new classification, its application is costly, requiring expensive analyzes. That is the reason the old WHO grade classification is still in use, especially in countries with limited resources.\nThe emergence of non-invasive histological and molecular diagnostics for nervous system neoplasms can revolutionize the efficacy and safety of medical care and radically reduce healthcare costs. The current state of artificial intelligence ap-\nplications in neuroimaging research opens up a promising perspective in that direction [3]. The scientific results in radiomicsbased brain malignancy typing are also inspirative [6]. The introduction of this quantitative neuroimaging analysis derived new diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tools and advocated for using them to enhance a personalized tumor diagnosis and management plan design in neurooncology [2]. Thus, radiomics, involving MRI as the most common imaging for brain tumors, is in the focus of researchers. However, most datadriven studies in neurooncology are limited with the amount of data available, which prevents the confident application of \u201cbig data\u201d and deep learning approaches.\nN.N. Burdenko Neurosurgery Center (Moscow, Russia) \u2013 is a leading neurosurgical facility in Russia and one of the biggest in the world. Over 20-year exploiting electronic health records and PACS, Neurosurgery Center has accumulated a large archive of nervous system images, which are usable in radiomics research. Our pilot study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning (DL) in subtyping gliomas by WHO grades (I-IV) based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from Burdenko Neurosurgery Center\u2019s database."

            "text": "The primary dataset for pilot machine learning experiments was obtained from Burdenko Neurosurgery Center's PACS for 1,280 patients with glial tumors and WHO grade verified by morphological descriptions who underwent preoperative MRI scanning in a period between 2009 and 2018. The data were MR (DICOM) images in series of brain sections identified for each patient, collected on several devices in different modes. Exploratory data analysis revealed inconsistency in the number of slices between patients, even in one modality (ranged 18 to 30 images). A greater difference in slice number appeared for different modes. The sets of MRI modalities also differed between patients. We decided to use only T1 axial images with contrast enhancement, since they were found in most subjects (n = 707) and were collected primarily on the same device. However, the remaining difference in scanning devices influenced the selected data to differ in a certain number of sections and image resolution.\nWe attempted to solve the technical task of classifying the patient's neuroimaging data (a series of MR images from a single study) by four classes (WHO grades): I, II, III, and IV. To accomplish this goal, two basic approaches were proposed. The\nfirst one - a \"3D classification\" \u2013 predicted tumor type for the entire patient's MRI data as a single object. This approach exploited 707 volumetric images (each collected from the series of patient preoperative slices). We advocated for the first approach as no manual slice labeling was done before the experiments. The second - a \"2D classification\" \u2013 was a separate prediction of tumor type for each specific slice in 17,730 images (an average of approximately 25 slices for each of 707 patients). The dataset appeared to be almost balanced across the glioma WHO grades I, II, III, IV (189, 133, 127, and 258 cases, respectively)."

The selected DICOM images were read and formatted as numeric arrays. These numbers reflected the pixel values of the source images. The resulting values were normalized by subtracting the average of the array elements and dividing by the standard deviation:\nThe resolution of each MR slice was scaled to 512 x 512. For all patients, the number of slices was adjusted to 32 using the Area interpolation algorithm. Thus, patients with fewer slices received additional images, while for patients with extra slices, some adjacent sections were averaged.\nIn the case of 2D classification, image preprocessing was different due to further use. The MR image from one slice was also read into a numeric array. The original single-channel image was transformed to three-channel, with the initial values duplicated into each channel. That approach did not violate the image structure but was required for feeding into the learning pipeline. Transformations were applied to adjust images to a single size 512 \u00d7 512, and normalize them with mean = (0.485, 0.456, 0.406), and standard deviation = (0.229, 0.224, 0.225). These values were derived from the ImageNet dataset to apply for pre-trained models. We used several augmentation techniques with a probability of 0.2: rotation by an angle <= 10 degrees, scaling transformation 0.9-1.1 of the original image, and image mirroring to increase the train size artificially."

            "text": "Defining the type of glioma is important for an early treatment plan design and prognosis assessment. However, the exact diagnosis determining the treatment modality comes from an invasive biopsy which is unsafe to a certain extent. The substitution of surgical procedures with non-invasive diagnostic methods should significantly improve patient safety and reduce time to deliver the most effective care, which is also crucial.\nN.N. Burdenko Neurosurgery Center has a large collection of glioma surgery cases documented in medical information systems. More than a thousand operations on glial tumors are performed annually. That is why the expertise in glioma surgery is rich at our Center, and the data we accumulated for two decades may be secondarily used for deep learning experiments. In this study, we present our initial experience in automatic differentiating of WHO grades for glial tumors \u2013 the task intuitively performed by clinicians as a preliminary judgment.\nThe efficiency of machine learning in subtyping gliomas reported in the literature does not contradict our preliminary results. H. Cho et al. (2018) have shown the potential of three models (logistic regression, support vector machine and random forest) to distinguish LGGs from HGGs with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9030 for the test cohort and an average of 88% accuracy, 95% sensitivity and 70% specificity [1,2]. The authors analysed MRI data from 285 patients with brain tumors using T1-weighted, T1-contrast enhanced, T2weighted and FLAIR MRI. Feature extraction was done with minimal redundancy maximum relevance algorithm.\nC. Su et al. (2019) explored the feasibility and diagnostic performance of radiomics based on anatomical, diffusion and perfusion MRI in differentiating glioma subtypes and predicting tumour proliferation [7]. The best AUC reached 0.896 for grades II-III, 0.997 for grades II-IV, and 0.881 for grades IIIIV.\nThe above-mentioned studies were primarily focused on feature engineering. Z. Ning et al. (2021) attempted to combine local MRI features with deep feature extraction using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to develop a noninvasive glioma grading model [6]. The authors report the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the model based on a combination of radiomics and deep features were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.91), 88% (95% CI: 80%, 93%), and 81% (95% CI: 76%, 86%), respectively, for the testing cohort. They stated that the developed model outperformed the models based only on either radiomics or deep features (p<0.001), and was also comparable to the clinical radiologists.\nIn our studies, a sole deep learning approach with well-proven models for image classification was utilized.\nAccording to the literature and our initial experience, the separation of LGG from HGG should be more solvable than differentiation WHO grades inside LGG or HGG. That is reasonable since \u0430n experienced physician usually sees the differences between benign and malignant neoplasms of the brain on MRI data in typical cases. Table I demonstrates the confidence of the model in the diagnosis of WHO grade I and IV, and less accuracy in WHO grade II-III subtyping. That is consistent with the clinician\u2019s experience in assessing the types of gliomas \"by eye.\"\nNowadays, we gain evidence that the application of machine learning to preoperative MRI demonstrates promising results for predicting IDH mutation, MGMT methylation, and 1p/19q codeletion in glioma [3]. We hope that our pilot study serves as a basis to contribute to research in computer-aided glioma diagnosis.\nNevertheless, we believe data scientists and neuroscientists do not have enough arguments to expect a non-invasive \u201cbiopsy\u201d coming from only one neuroimaging modality. It is much more likely that the highest quality of non-invasive diagnostics with deep learning can be obtained with simultaneous usage of various neuroimaging modalities: different MRI modes, including spectroscopy, CT, including perfusion, and PET. Collecting such a complex dataset presents significant challenges. However, the development of non-invasive tumor subtyping technologies within individual modalities will create the basis for future complex solutions and enable a better understanding of which methods appear promising, which tumor signatures are divided better. At least, that information may be supportive in clinical decision-making. This is how the authors of this article see the prospects for deep learning development in neuroimaging diagnostics.\nThe limitation of our study was still a sample size, data inconsistency in terms of format and quantity. However, the experimental settings were close to what practitioners are faced with in real-world routine. In a 2D approach, no manual by-slice labeling was applied, so the slices with no tumor on them were inevitably and erroneously labeled with the WHO grade a patient has. That could certainly influence the quality of classification. However, we accept this limitation in the pilot study since the manual labeling requires much more effort and may be shifted to the next stage. It was principally important for us to verify our neuroimaging data's separability by WHO grade and relate it with the results of other researchers, especially when obtained with a different methodology. Tumor delineation may also be considered as an additional preprocessing step."
