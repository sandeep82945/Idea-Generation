    "abstractText": "The rapid emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in current use is occurring worldwide and poses a significant threat to global healthcare systems. Recent research to identify new effective anti-bacterial agents has focused on regulatory pathways as targets for interference. Regulatory mechanisms employing intracellular Bis-(3\u2032,5\u2032) cyclic di-guanylate (c-di-GMP) as a secondary messenger represent a distinct category of subjects. This molecule, c-di-GMP, is present in nearly all bacterial species and plays a pivotal role in governing various biological processes, encompassing antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and virulence. Alteration of the cellular concentrations of the nucleotide through modulation of associated signaling pathways has the potential to reduce biofilm formation or increase susceptibility of the biofilm bacteria to antibiotics. Here, we have developed a screen for compounds that alter c-di-GMP levels in Pseudomonas aeruginosa in co-culture with bronchial epithelial cells. Through the assay of 200 natural compounds, we were able to identify several substances showing promising effects on P. aeruginosa in a host biofilm infection model. Importantly, we detected compounds that inhibit c-di-GMP levels and showed significant influence on biofilm formation and virulence in P. aeruginosa in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, we offer proof-of-concept information regarding swift and practical drug screening assays, suitable for mediumto high-throughput applications, which target the c-di-GMP signaling pathways in this significant Gram-negative pathogen.",

It is notorious for causing infections in individuals with conditions such as cystic fibrosis, severe burns, chronic wounds, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and those with implanted biomaterials. The ability of P. aeruginosa to form biofilms presents a significant challenge, rendering the bacteria highly resistant to antibiotics and host immune defenses (An et\u00a0al., 2019).\nTargeting the c-di-GMP signaling pathway in P. aeruginosa offers a promising strategy to combat antibiotic-resistant infections (Caly et\u00a0al., 2015; An and Ryan, 2016; Andersen et\u00a0al., 2021). By manipulating c-di-GMP levels, it is possible to influence key virulence traits of the bacterium, including biofilm formation and the production of virulence factors (Bjarnsholt et\u00a0al., 2010; Andersen et\u00a0al., 2021; Mamat et\u00a0 al., 2023; R\u00f6mling, 2023). This approach provides a unique opportunity to attenuate the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa without exerting selective pressure for the development of antibiotic resistance.\nIn this study, we\u00a0 aimed to identify compounds capable of modulating c-di-GMP levels and inhibiting P. aeruginosa host associated biofilm formation and virulence. To do this, we\u00a0developed and employed a screening model that involved co-culturing human airway epithelial cells with P. aeruginosa, creating a physiologically relevant environment for biofilm formation. By screening a diverse set of natural products, known for their chemical diversity and biological activities, we\u00a0 identified lead compounds that can effectively target c-di-GMP signaling and disrupt virulence and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. Of note, we\u00a0could identify several novel chemical entities that were able to protect host cells from P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and cell death. One compound, 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, was capable of modulating c-di-GMP signaling in P. aeruginosa. This compound exhibited the ability to reduce cytotoxicity, inhibit biofilm formation in an in vitro co-culture biofilm model, and decrease mortality in an in vivo Galleria mellonella infection model. The data furnish proof-ofconcept evidence for fast and feasible medium- to high-throughput screening assays for novel compounds, aimed at modulating c-di-GMP levels. Such endeavors hold promise in facilitating the discovery of potent anti-biofilm agents."

We\u00a0constructed a dual-labeled reporter strain that allowed the library of natural compounds to be\u00a0 screened for their effects on both modulation of bacterial c-di-GMP signaling and growth during infection. The WT PA14 strain was initially marked using the\nFrontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org\nmini-Tn7 reporter construct obtained from pUC18T-mini-Tn7Tlux-Gm through a four-parental mating approach. This involved E. coli DH5\u03b1 strains carrying the delivery vectors as donor strains and E. coli strains containing pUX-BF13 and pRK600 as helper strains, as previously outlined in Damron et\u00a0al. (2013). Then, the plasmid-based reporter pCdrA::gfpC (Rybtke et\u00a0al., 2012) was introduced into the lux-labeled background strains by electroporation, generating the dual-labeled reporter strain named PA14-lux (pCdrA::gfpC; Supplementary Table\u00a0 1). The experimental strain PA14-lux (pCdrA::gfpC) and the control strain WT PA14 were cultivated in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Bioluminescence and GFP fluorescence were measured using a multimode microplate reader. Supplementary Figure\u00a0 1A illustrates that WT PA14 exhibited background-level bioluminescence, whereas PA14-lux (pCdrA::gfpC) displayed an elevated bioluminescent signal. As seen in Supplementary Figure\u00a01B, the baseline reference is set by the GFP expression of the WT PA14 strain, represented as 100%. Without antibiotic treatment, the dual-labeled reporter strain PA14-lux (pCdrA::gfpC) exhibits similar GFP expression to the WT strain due to low c-di-GMP levels, resulting in low cdrA::gfp transcription. However, the addition of Ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/mL) and Gentamicin (5 \u03bcg/mL) induces a significant increase in GFP expression in PA14lux (pCdrA::gfpC), surpassing the WT strain by over 20%. Sub-minimal inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) antibiotic exposure has been shown to enhance biofilm formation, elevate c-di-GMP levels, and subsequently promote increased cdrA::gfp transcription through heightened c-di-GMP levels within the bacteria (Nolan and Behrends, 2021). These findings suggest that the reporter can serve as a valuable tool for tracking both the viability of P. aeruginosa strains and the alterations in c-di-GMP levels induced by drug treatments.\nHuman bronchial epithelial cell-based co-culture assay development and validation\nThe human bronchial epithelial cell-based co-culture with P. aeruginosa was used to screen small molecules for inhibition of virulence (measured as loss of cytotoxicity to human cells), modulation of the cellular c-di-GMP level, and inhibition of bacterial growth (Figure\u00a01A). Bacteria were inoculated into plates seeded with 16HBE cells together with test compounds, tobramycin (a positive control) or DMSO (a negative control), according to the layout shown in Figure\u00a01B. Assay quality is measured by Robust Z\u2019. The Robust Z\u2019 values for bioluminescent, red cytotoxicity, and GFP are calculated according to the formula provided in section Materials and methods (Figure\u00a01C; Here only positive/negative controls are used for Robust Z\u2019 calculation\u2014three replicates). As they are all above 0.5 (average 0.96, 0.87, and 0.66 respectively; Figure\u00a01C), the assay quality was deemed robust.\nInitial screening to identify compounds that modulate the c-di-GMP level during infection\nWe performed an initial screening of 200 compounds sourced from the Puretitre natural compound library (Caithness\nBiotechnologies) at a fixed concentration of 250 \u03bcM. Representative bioluminescent, GFP raw data, and %Cytotoxicity are shown in Supplementary Figures\u00a02Ai\u2013iii, respectively. A color gradient heatmap has been used to represent well values, with warmer colors like red indicating lower bioluminescent/GFP/red fluorescent values, and cooler colors like green signifying higher values. To assess the efficacy of our assay, we\u00a0compared the performance of positive controls and negative controls. Robust z\u2019 values were calculated to determine the assay\u2019s response window for bioluminescent, GFP, and %Cytotoxicity measurements. The average values obtained were 0.82, 0.72, and 0.53, respectively (Figure\u00a02A). These values demonstrate the reliability and consistency of the screening procedure. Based on the robust quality of the assay, we\u00a0proceeded to further analyze the acquired data. The % inhibition of cytotoxicity and intracellular c-di-GMP levels (GFP) are determined using the formulas detailed in the section Materials and methods. Representative data for these calculations are presented in Supplementary Figures\u00a0 2Bi,ii respectively. Well values have been visualized using a color gradient heatmap, where warmer colors such as red represent lower % inhibition, and cooler colors like green signify higher % inhibition. Furthermore, scatter plots illustrating these values from individual wells can be\u00a0found in Figures\u00a02B,C.\nThe assay revealed two distinct categories of compounds of interest. Compounds highlighted in Figure\u00a02B appear to possess the potential to regulate intracellular levels of c-di-GMP with minimal effects on bacterial growth, whereas those identified in Figure\u00a02C demonstrate inhibitory properties against cytotoxicity.\nTo identify compounds with a significant effect on intracellular levels of c-di-GMP, we\u00a0selected a \u00b1 50% cut-off (indicated by dotted lines) in Figure\u00a02B. Hits that meet this cut-off criterion are denoted by red dots, and a total of 18 compounds were identified in Supplementary Table\u00a0 2. Out of these, 11 compounds promoted c-di-GMP levels, while seven compounds inhibited them. Notably, we\u00a0discovered three antibiotics that can regulate c-di-GMP levels but may promote cytotoxicity under the tested conditions.\nFor compounds with a significant ability to inhibit cytotoxicity, we\u00a0 employed a + 50% cut-off (indicated by dotted lines) in\nFigure\u00a0 2C. We\u00a0 identified 30 compounds meeting this criterion (Supplementary Table\u00a03). By integrating the two sets of data, we\u00a0found that five compounds influenced c-di-GMP levels and inhibited virulence without impacting growth. Among these, four compounds promoted c-di-GMP levels, potentially leading to increased biofilm formation. The remaining compound, 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (esculetin), inhibited both c-di-GMP levels and cytotoxicity."

In contrast, cells treated with 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin in conjunction with tobramycin (TB) maintained their morphology. These results align with the cytotoxicity data, as cells treated with the wild-type strain exhibited high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, while cells treated with 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin in conjunction with tobramycin (TB) showed a significant reduction in LDH levels (Supplementary Figure\u00a03B).\nThe effect of 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin on the efficacy of tobramycin (TB) treatment was further evaluated in the Galleria mellonella infection model.

In response to this urgent issue, researchers have been exploring new strategies to identify efficient anti-bacterial agents. One promising approach is targeting regulatory pathways that utilize intracellular Bis-(3\u2032,5\u2032) cyclic di-guanylate (c-di-GMP) as a second messenger. C-di-GMP is present in nearly all bacteria and plays a vital role in regulating various processes, including antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and virulence.

In this way, we\u00a0hoped to mimic the complex interactions between bacterial biofilms and host cells, providing an insight into bacterial behavior and biofilm formation during the infection process.\nOne notable advantage of the developed screening method is its scalability. The ability to scale up the assay allows for the screening of a large number of compounds, increasing the chances of identifying potential inhibitors or modulators of c-di-GMP levels. This scalability is crucial for efficiently screening compound libraries and expanding the scope of potential therapeutic interventions. By screening a natural compound library consisting of 200 compounds, we\u00a0 successfully identified a potential inhibitor, 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, which demonstrated promising effects in modulating c-di-GMP levels, biofilm formation, and virulence in P. aeruginosa.\n6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, alternatively known as esculetin, is a naturally-occurring compound primarily sourced from the Chinese\nherbal medicine Fraxinus rhynchophylla Hance. This compound exhibits a wide range of pharmacological properties, encompassing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, cardiovascular protective effects, and notable antibacterial capabilities (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022).\nOur experimental findings do not provide sufficient evidence to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the mechanism responsible for the esculetin-induced reduction of c-di-GMP levels in P. aeruginosa. It is widely acknowledged that c-di-GMP levels are intricately controlled by two enzymes with opposing actions. Specifically, c-di-GMP is synthesized from two GTP molecules by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and broken down into two GTP molecules via pGpG by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The decrease in cellular c-di-GMP levels can occur through two potential routes: either by reducing the activity of DGCs containing GGDEF domains or by enhancing the activity of PDEs containing EAL and/or HD-GYP domains. It is plausible that the observed alterations in c-di-GMP levels and associated phenotypic changes induced by esculetin could be\u00a0attributed to direct interference with these enzymes involved in c-di-GMP synthesis and degradation. Alternatively, it cannot be\u00a0ruled out that esculetin exerts its influence on c-di-GMP levels by affecting enzymes engaged in c-di-GMP metabolism, possibly at the posttranscriptional or post-translational level. Moreover, there is the\nFIGURE\u00a05 Effects of 6,7-Dihydroxycoumarin on Galleria mellonella larvae infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Means and standard deviations from triplicate experiments are shown.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 09 frontiersin.org\npossibility that esculetin might indirectly lower c-di-GMP levels in P. aeruginosa through a different, as yet unidentified mechanism. To thoroughly investigate these potential mechanisms of action by esculetin, a comprehensive series of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo assays would be\u00a0key.\nDespite lack of complete understanding of the mode of action of esculetin-mediated reduction of the c-di-GMP level in P. aeruginosa, research into the antibacterial and anti-biofilm potential of esculetin has yielded promising results across multiple bacterium types. In one study, esculetin significantly inhibited quorum sensing (QS) and biofilm formation in Aeromonas hydrophila. Different concentrations of esculetin (25, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/mL) were shown to reduce the production of protease and hemolysin, impair biofilm formation, and attenuate swarming motility. The anti-biofilm activity of esculetin was confirmed using confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of genes positively related to QS and biofilm formation, and upregulation of a gene (litR) negatively related to biofilm formation. The alteration in gene expression aligned with the phenotypic changes, indicating the potential of esculetin as a QS inhibitor for A. hydrophila (Sun et\u00a0al., 2021).\nIn addition to its impact on A. hydrophila, synthetic derivatives of esculetin, specifically 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin-5-carboxylates (DHCou and 4-Me-DHCou), have demonstrated effective antibiofilm properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Notably, these compounds do not exhibit the cytotoxicity typically associated with the parent 6,7-dihydroxycoumarins like esculetin and 4-methylesculetin (Zscherp et\u00a0al., 2023).\nEsculetin has also demonstrated notable antibacterial efficacy against the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum and E. coli O157:H7, a frequent culprit behind hemorrhagic colitis (Lee et\u00a0al., 2014; Yang et\u00a0 al., 2016). It seems to damage the bacterial cell membrane and inhibit biofilm formation, most likely by repressing key virulence genes. These findings suggest potential applications of esculetin in antivirulence strategies for managing bacterial infections.\nHowever, despite these promising results, the therapeutic use of esculetin is somewhat hampered by its low oral bioavailability, linked to its extensive metabolism through glucuronidation. Despite this limitation, the potential of esculetin for treating a range of conditions, from bacterial infections to chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders, is increasingly recognized.\nThe methodology we\u00a0developed is adaptable to other infection models. Biofilm-related infections can occur in various host tissues and organs, necessitating the investigation of different contexts. By replicating the co-culture model with different host cell types, we\u00a0can examine the effects of c-di-GMP modulators on biofilm formation and antibiotic susceptibility in diverse settings. This adaptability enhances the generalizability and translational potential of our findings, allowing for a broader application in combating bacterial infections.\nIn summary, directing efforts toward regulatory pathways that involve c-di-GMP represents a promising strategy in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The use of a co-culture model incorporating bronchial epithelial cells enables the comprehensive study of biofilm interactions with host cells. The scalability of our\nscreening method facilitates the screening of large compound libraries, leading to the identification of potential c-di-GMP modulators in addition to 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin. Additionally, the adaptability of the methodology to other infection models enhances its applicability in addressing biofilm-related infections in diverse host environments.\nAdditional research and development built upon these discoveries have the potential to make significant contributions to the creation of innovative therapeutic approaches for addressing antibioticresistant bacteria."
