ABSTRACT Objective The ASTRUM005 trial showed that serplulimab plus chemotherapy (SEP) significantly extended survival time compared with chemotherapy in the treatment of small cell lung cancer. But the survival benefits of SEP came at high costs, and its economy is not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the costeffectiveness of SEP from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. Design A partition survival model was built to simulate the outcomes. The clinical data came from the ASTRUM005 trial, and only direct medical costs were included in the model. The utility values referred to the published literature. Scenario analyses 1 and 2 explored outcomes in the presence of a patient assistance plan (PAP) and different simulation periods, respectively. Scenario analysis 3 compared the costeffectiveness of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy (AEP) with SEP by network metaanalysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Outcome measures Total costs, incremental costs, life years, qualityadjusted life years (QALYs), incremental QALYs and incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER). Results Compared with chemotherapy, SEP achieved an additional 0.34 QALYs at incremental costs of US$41 682.63, with an ICER of US$122 378.86/QALY. When PAP was available, ICER was US$58 316.46/QALY. In the simulation time of 5 years and 20 years, the ICER was US$132 637.97/QALY and US$118 054.59/QALY, respectively. When compared with AEP, SEP not only reduced the costs by US$47 244.87 but also gained 0.07 QALYs more. Sensitivity analyses showed that the price of serplulimab and the utility value of the progressionfree survival stage were the main influencing parameters, and the results were stable. Conclusions Compared with chemotherapy, SEP was not costeffective from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. However, SEP was absolutely dominant in comparison with AEP.",

Since 2000, the incidence and mortality of lung cancer in China have been\nincreasing year by year.1 2 According to the statistics of Global Cancer 2020, the number of new lung cancer cases and deaths in the world was about 2.2 million and 1.8 million, respectively, and the number of lung cancer cases and deaths in China accounted for 37.0% and 39.8% of the world\u2019s total, ranking first in cancer incidence and mortality.3 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most malignant subtype of lung cancer, with a percentage of about 13\u201317% of all lung cancers.4 5 Due to the atypical early symptoms, rapid progress and easy metastasis, most patients are in the extensive stage at the time of initial diagnosis, and the lack of clinically effective drugs, the 5- year survival rate falls short of 7%.6 7\nIn the past 30 years, etoposide coupled with platinum (EP) has been the dominant treatment regimen for extensive- stage small cell lung cancer (ES- SCLC). Although the initial efficacy is acceptable, most patients develop relapse and drug resistance after initial treatment and the median survival time is only about 9\u201311 months.6 8 9 Therefore, finding a\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 This study used a partition survival model to assess the cost- effectiveness of serplulimab plus chemotherapy against chemotherapy for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in China. \u21d2 Network meta- analysis was applied to compare the cost- effectiveness of serplulimab plus chemotherapy against atezolizumab plus chemotherapy for SCLC in this study. \u21d2 A major unavoidable limitation of this study was that we had to extrapolate long- term survival based on the Kaplan- Meier curves due to the short follow- up time of the clinical trial.\nP atna).

The survival advantage of each additional month can bring more treatment options for patients, so the survival benefit of patients still needs to be further improved. Serplulimab, a newly developed programmed death 1 (PD- 1) inhibitor, combined with chemotherapy not only improved the median overall survival (OS) of patients with ES- SCLC to 15.4 months (10.9 months in the chemotherapy group) for the first time, achieving an unprecedented survival benefit, but also accomplished the lowest HR (HR: 0.63) to date and the risk of death was also reduced by 37%.16\nAlthough serplulimab has significant survival benefit advantages, its high price will bring a heavy economic burden to patients as well as the healthcare system, and its economics are not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of serplulimab in combination with EP (SEP) versus EP, based on the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system."

To calculate the drug dose, the patients in this model were assumed to have the following characteristics: weight of 65 kg, body surface area of 1.72 m2 and creatinine clearance of 70 mL/min.17 18 So dose per cycle was as follows: serplulimab 4.5 mg/kg (d1), etoposide 100 mg/ m2 (d1- d3), carboplatin within the area under the serum drug concentration- time curve of 5 mg/mL/min (d1). Consistent with the ASTRUM- 005 trial, 44% of patients in the SEP group and 43.4% of those in the EP group received subsequent therapy. Patients who did not receive subsequent treatment received the best supportive care (BSC). Because the ASTRUM- 005 trial did not publish a specific subsequent treatment regimen, the study selected topotecan (1.25 mg/m2/d, d1 per cycle) as the\nmain treatment drug after disease progression referred to the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO).19 20"

The cost information and incidence of adverse reactions were shown in table 1.\nThe ASTRUM- 005 trial did not report information on the quality of life of patients, and there was no study on the utility value of SCLC, so this study used the utility value of non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which was obtained from the data of the Chinese population in an international study. The health utility value of the PFS and PD stages were 0.804 and 0.321, respectively.22 In addition, disutility values related to adverse reactions also came from published literature (table 1).22 23"

The most common one in deterministic sensitivity analysis is one- way sensitivity analysis. Therefore, one- way sensitivity was performed on important parameters in the model, such as cost values, health utility values and discount rate, and the results were presented in a tornado diagram. The cost range of drugs was derived from the\nupper and lower limits presented by China Medical Information Network (https://www.menet.com.cn). Because there is no possibility that serplulimab will increase in price, the upper limit was set to the baseline value, and the lower limit was set to 80% of the baseline value. The health utility values of PFS and PD stages were obtained from the upper and lower limits published in the literature.22 The discount rate fluctuates from 0% to 8%.21 The remaining parameters were taken to be \u00b120% of their baseline values. PSA was carried out to model the effect on the analysis results when multiple uncertainty parameters were changed simultaneously.

But the cumulative duration of serplulimab does not exceed 24 months. This study assumed that patients in the serplulimab group would receive a donation to evaluate the economics of the two regimens in this scenario. (2) The simulation time of the model was set to 5 years and 20 years, respectively, to simulate the costs consumption and survival benefit of different times. (3) The IMpower133 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in combination with EP (AEP) in the treatment of ES- SCLC.14 Baseline characteristics of patients in IMpower133 and ASTRUM005 were similar (online supplemental table 3), such as median age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score and brain metastases, and were controlled by EP, so we thought SEP was comparable to AEP. First of all, due to the lack of head- to- head clinical trials between SEP versus AEP, this study used the survival data of the SEP group as a control, and calculated the survival data of AEP using the HR derived from the network metaanalysis (NMA) results for indirect comparison. Second, the R software (https://www.r-project.org) was used to invoke the gemtc package for Bayesian NMA using the HR effect scale index. The fitting degree of the fixed effect and random effect models was judged according to the value of the deviance information criterion (DIC). If the difference of DIC between the two models was less than or equal to 5, the fitting degree of the two models was considered consistent and the model with a smaller I2 was selected. If the DIC difference was more than 5, the model with a smaller value of DIC was selected. Finally, following the method of Hoyle et al, the fitting parameters (scale parameter (\u03bb) and shape parameter (\u03b3) of the best fit (log- logistic distribution) of PFS and OS curves for the AEP group were transformed with the following formula: \u03b3AEP= \u03b3SEP, \u03bbAEP= \u03bbSEP\u00d7 HR (table 1).\n24 The survival rate of the AEP group was calculated according to the transformation parameters."

The ASTRUM005 trial showed that the addition of serplulimab, a novel PD- 1 inhibitor, to chemotherapy significantly improved OS by 4.5 months (15.4 months vs 10.9 months) and PFS (5.7 months vs 4.3 months).16 It is the first drug to prolong the OS of patients with SCLC to more than 4 months. Based on the results of this clinical trial, the serplulimab plus EP was entered into the CSCO guidelines as category 1A evidence. In addition, Chinese patients accounted for 67% of the enrolled population in the ASTRUM- 005 trial, which was more in line with Chinese clinical practice.\nThis study evaluated the cost- effectiveness of EP versus SEP as the first- line treatment for SCLC from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. The results showed that ICER (US$122 378.86/QALY) was much higher than the WTP (US$35 107.74/QALY). Therefore, SEP is impossible to be an economical treatment option. Univariate sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of serplulimab and the health utility value of the PFS stage had the greatest impact on the model, but neither changed the results of the base analysis. Our results were consistent with other cost- effectiveness research conclusions about PD- (L)1 inhibitor in the treatment of SCLC, namely the newly approved drugs combined with EP for SCLC, such as atezolizumab and durvalumab, were not economic.27 28 The reasons why these drugs did not have cost- effective advantages were related to the disease type and lower WTP values in addition to their high price. First, a drug often has more than one indication. For example, durvalumab can be used not only for the treatment of SCLC but also for the treatment of NSCLC. Although durvalumab coupled with chemotherapy was not economical for the treatment of ES- SCLC, a metaanalysis showed that durvalumab combined with chemotherapy was cost- effective for the consolidation treatment of NSCLC.29 Regretfully, there are no cost- effective studies on serplulimab in the treatment of other types of diseases, so the economics of serplulimab in the treatment of other types of diseases is still unclear. Second, the economy of a drug is largely affected by the WTP value. Because antineoplastic drugs are expensive, the ICER value of oncological drugs would be approximately two times higher than that of other drugs.30 Therefore, when assessing the cost- effectiveness of drugs ground on the viewpoint of the healthcare system in the USA, the WTP of anticancer drugs (US$100 000~150 000/QALY) tends to be higher than that of other drugs (US$50 000~10 000/QALY).30 Unfortunately, most PD- (L)1 anticancer drugs did not have an economic advantage even if their WTP threshold was higher than other drugs in America, such as atezolizumab and durvalumab.27 28 In the case of high prices of antitumour drugs, China still follows the\nrecommendation of WHO and chooses one to three times per capita GDP as the threshold of willingness to pay. But even if three times the per capita GDP of the most developed cities in China, such as Beijing, are selected to do WTP (US$79 765.9/QALY), these new drugs will not have cost- effective advantages. So, for a country with limited resources like China, what can be done to improve the economics of new antitumour drugs?\nFirst, negotiate a lower price for the drug and put it on the Medicare list. One study showed that atezolizumab, when reduced in price by 80%, may have a cost- effective advantage at a WTP threshold of US$32 517/QALY.31 Same as serplulimab, sintilimab, a domestic PD- 1, was launched in China at the end of 2019 with a price as high as US$1132.74. In just 2 years, the price dropped to US$156.08, a whopping 86% drop. Therefore, the economy of serplulimab will be greatly improved after the price reduction. Second, it is recommended that biomarkers can be used to select patients who are most suitable for immunosuppressive therapy so that the survival benefit of patients will be improved and the drug will be more economical. The expression of PD- L1 has been used as a biomarker to forecast the efficacy of immunosuppressive agents in a variety of solid tumours, but its predictive value in SCLC has not been determined.32 33 SCLC is usually accompanied by a high tumour mutation burden (TMB). Some studies have found that patients with high TMB have the advantage of immunotherapy benefits, but further studies based on TMB are needed.34\u201336 Other potential predictors of immunosuppressive efficacy in SCLC include gene- expression profile, tumour- infiltrating lymphocyte and circulating tumour cells.8 37 However, due to the high heterogeneity of SCLC, combinatorial biomarkers may be more valuable than single biomarkers in screening the population benefiting from immunotherapy.33 38 Finally, studies have shown that the time spent at the end of a patient\u2019s life is often more socially meaningful than at any other stage of life, which means that the opportunity costs of prolonging life near the end are acceptable.39 Britain and America have introduced policies for treatment at the end of life, raising the threshold for the average willingness to pay. Therefore, it is suggested to explore a reasonable willingness to pay threshold at the end of life by combining China\u2019s economic development level and the social average willingness to pay.\nScenario analysis 1 showed that the ICER in the presence of PAP was US$58 316.46/QALY, which was about one- half of that in the absence of PAP. Mainly because most of the total costs of patients receiving immunotherapy were generated by immunotherapy drugs. After obtaining PAP, the healthcare system only paid for no more than 12 cycles of immunotherapy drugs, so the total costs dropped by about half.\nScenario analysis 2 explored the ICER under different simulation times, and the results showed that the ICER decreased with longer simulation times. This may be related to the \u2018delayed effect\u2019 of the action mechanism\nP atna).

Cancer immunotherapy can bring durable immune responses and long- term survival benefits to patients, and patients continue to benefit in subsequent survival over time.40 Therefore, the longer the simulation time, the greater the clinical benefit of the SEP group and the better economy of the protocol.\nIn the exploration of SCLC immunotherapy, the IMpower133 trial and CASPIAN trial have confirmed the efficacy and safety of PD- L1 inhibitors in the treatment of SCLC.14 15 In contrast to the PD- L1 inhibitors, the PD- 1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab were both approved for the treatment of SCLC, but subsequent clinical trials demonstrated unsatisfactory results, so the FDA quickly withdrew their SCLC indications, which has made researchers doubt the feasibility of PD- 1 inhibitors in ES- SCLC. However, the emergence of serplulimab not only broke the dilemma of PD- 1 inhibitors in the treatment of ES- SCLC but also brought the longest survival benefit to date when it was combined with chemotherapy. Although SEP did not have a cost- effectiveness advantage in comparison with conventional chemotherapy, scenario analysis 3 showed that SEP was absolutely dominant in comparison with AEP, a new first- line treatment regimen in ES- SCLC, which suggested that PD- 1 inhibitors may be more economical than PD- L1 inhibitors in the treatment of ES- SCLC.\nThere are also some limitations in this study. First, because of the short follow- up time in the ASTRUM- 005 trial, we had to extrapolate long- term survival beyond the follow- up time; however, this was unavoidable. Second, to simplify the model, only serious adverse reactions with an incidence of more than 4% were included in the model, and only drug costs were calculated for the management costs of adverse events, which may lead to a reduction in costs, but sensitivity analysis showed that the management costs of adverse events had little effect on the results. Third, one- way sensitivity analysis showed that the utility value of the PFS stage had a great impact on the model, but there was no domestic study on the utility value of SCLC, so we had to use the utility value of NSCLC instead of SCLC. Fourth, the treatment plan after disease progression was recommended by the CSCO guidelines and the NCCN guidelines, without considering individual differences. However, in the actual clinical treatment setting, patients may receive immunotherapy after chemotherapy, which may lead to high ICER."
