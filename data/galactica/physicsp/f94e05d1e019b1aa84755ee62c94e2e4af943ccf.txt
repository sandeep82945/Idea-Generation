Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a noninvasive and rapid analytical technique that provides information on the chemical composition, structure, and conformation of biomolecules in saliva. This technique has been widely used to analyze salivary biomolecules, owing to its label-free advantages. Saliva contains a complex mixture of biomolecules including water, electrolytes, lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids which are potential biomarkers for several diseases. IR spectroscopy has shown great promise for the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases such as dental caries, periodontitis, infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease, as well as for drug monitoring. Recent advancements in IR spectroscopy, such as Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy, have further enhanced its utility in salivary analysis. FTIR spectroscopy enables the collection of a complete IR spectrum of the sample, whereas ATR spectroscopy enables the analysis of samples in their native form, without the need for sample preparation. With the development of standardized protocols for sample collection and analysis and further advancements in IR spectroscopy, the potential for salivary diagnostics using IR spectroscopy is vast. 1. conclusions In the future, we expect to see further advancements in IR spectroscopy, which will enhance its utility in salivary analysis. Salivary analysis with IR spectroscopy is a powerful tool in personalized medicine, as it allows for non-invasive and accurate analysis of a patient’s chemical composition, providing valuable insights into their health status and enabling personalized treatment plans. By analyzing the chemical composition of saliva using IR spectroscopy, personalized medicine can create individualized treatment plans for
patients. For example, patients with DM may have specific salivary biomarkers that indicate poor glycemic control. Salivary analysis using IR spectroscopy can detect these biomarkers, enabling personalized treatment plans that may include changes in diet, exercise, and medication. This is also valuable for drug development and personalized drug therapy. IR spectroscopy can be used to identify the chemical composition of drugs and their metabolites in saliva, allowing the development of personalized drug therapies based on a patient’s unique metabolic profile. It is important to note that while IR spectroscopy holds promise in personalized medicine, further research, validation, and standardization are necessary to establish its clinical utility across different stages and subtypes of the disease. Further investigations involving a larger number of patients, including those with complex diseases, are necessary to establish a comprehensive methodology that accounts for the diversity of saliva in the human population. The development of standardized protocols for sample collection, preparation, and analysis can further enhance the utility of salivary diagnostics and pave the way for personalized medicine. Another area of development is the use of portable IR spectrometers that can be used in point-of-care testing. These devices can be used for the rapid and non-invasive diagnosis of diseases using saliva samples, making them ideal for use in clinical settings. There is ongoing research on the use of new IR spectroscopy techniques such as surfaceenhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. These techniques can provide higher sensitivity and specificity for the analysis of salivary biomolecules, allowing the detection of diseases at an earlier stage. Overall, the use of IR spectroscopy for salivary analysis is promising. With continued research and development, we expect to see further advancements in IR spectroscopy techniques that will enable a more accurate and rapid diagnosis of various diseases using saliva samples. Moreover, it has the potential to revolutionize disease treatment, thereby rendering personalized medicine a reality for many patients.
