"The neolignans evaluated in this study demonstrated promising in vitro activity on amastigote forms of T. cruzi, with emphasis on compounds 1, 2, and 4. The results obtained from molecular docking indicated that 1, 2, and 4 are capable of destabilizing the dynamics of the tubulin-microtubule from the vinca site. The results indicated that the presence of the ester carbonyl at C9 and C9′ and the double bond between C7′ and C8′ play a key role in the antitrypanosomal activity. Compound 1 displayed an IC50 against the T. cruzi Y strain similar to that of BZN but with a two-fold increased selectivity to T. cruzi as compared to LLC-MK2 cells. These results demonstrated that DBN 1 can be considered a molecular prototype that could be used for the development of new antitrypanosomal drugs."
