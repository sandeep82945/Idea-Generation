    "abstractText": "Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic has been a major disruptor of routine life, resulting in increased stress and predisposing people to negative outcomes, such as insomnia, anxiety and hopelessness. Mind-body interventions have improved concentration, emotional balance, and positive emotions, with an enhanced sense of productivity, and self-confidence. We therefore hypothesized that exposure to an online mind-body intervention, \u201cInner Engineering Completion Online (IECO),\u201d would reduce stress and promote well-being.",

Mind-body interventions have improved concentration, emotional balance, and positive emotions, with an enhanced sense of productivity, and self-confidence. We therefore hypothesized that exposure to an online mind-body intervention, \u201cInner Engineering Completion Online (IECO),\u201d would reduce stress and promote well-being.\nMethods: This prospective cohort study enrolled participants registered for the IECO courses, which for the first time were delivered remotely, online. Participants learned a 21-min meditation practice called Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya during the course, which incorporates controlled breathing and mediation techniques. Each enrolled participant was asked to complete self-reported electronic surveys at three key time points: at the time of consent, immediately after completing IECO, and 6 weeks after IECO completion. Effects of IECO practice were assessed using four well-validated neuropsychological scales: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Positive Emotion/Relationship/Engagement Scale (PERMA) Profiler, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). A Signed Rank test was used to analyze the survey data and P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults: Of the 375 participants interested in participation, 164 participants were eligible. Sixty-eight participants completed surveys at all time points and were identified as compliant participants. The baseline median score for PSS in compliant participants (n = 95) was 13.5 (IQR 9, 18); immediate post-IECO median PSS score was 12 (IQR 8, 16) demonstrating a 1.5 unit decrease in PSS scores (p-value = 0.0023). Similarly, comparing PSS scores in compliant participants (n = 68) for immediate Post IECO [11.5 (IQR 8, 15.5)] to PSS scores at six weeks [8 (IQR 4.5, 12.5)] showed a statistically significant 3.5-unit decrease, indicating a reduction in stress upon routine practice of the intervention (p < 0.0001).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 814224\nConclusion: Incorporating the remotely delivered mind-body intervention Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya into daily life via the IECO program over as few as 6 weeks produced a significant stress reduction, improvement in sleep quality and mindfulness.\nClinical Trial Registration: [ClinicalTrials.gov], identifier [NCT04189146].\nKeywords: Yoga, meditation, perceived stress, Isha, IECO"

            "text": "Stress refers to physiological changes occurring in an organism in response to a potentially adverse change in the environment, whether real or perceived (Jo\u00ebls and Baram, 2009). This stress response is mediated through an array of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and steroids, particularly glucocorticoids and catecholamines (Jo\u00ebls and Baram, 2009; Golbidi et al., 2015). Although the stress response is postulated to allow organisms to adapt to changes in the environment in the short term, its chronic activation is associated with more significant systemic inflammation, a disrupted microbiome, and a greater risk for cardiovascular disease, aside from negative mental health consequences (Golbidi et al., 2015; Househam et al., 2017).\nDespite routine use of anxiolytics in treating individuals with high stress or anxiety disorders, a combination of pharmacotherapy and mind-body interventions is being increasingly explored as a means of aiding such patients (Lee et al., 2007). Meditation may be a cheap, relatively easy to learn, and safe means of combating stress and increasing feelings of well-being in daily life (Goyal et al., 2014; Khalsa, 2015; Edwards et al., 2018).\nMeditation, a means of developing insight and regulating internal states of consciousness, has been a part of Eastern, Western, and various Indigenous spiritual traditions for millennia, but is only recently undergoing scientific scrutiny in the context of health and disease. \u201cMindfulness\u201d can be defined as the state of moment-tomoment awareness of present experiences or the meditation method. This state of insight development and internal selfregulation is achieved through attention control, emotion regulation, and contemplation of self, i.e., self-awareness (Tang et al., 2015).\nMeditation practices are associated with positive effects on autonomic nervous system activity (Libby et al., 2012; Koerten et al., 2020), brain functionality (Tang et al., 2015), and immune function (Househam et al., 2017). Further, these practices have shown to improve concentration, emotional balance and positive emotions, with an enhanced sense of productivity, and selfconfidence (Allen et al., 2021). Negative emotions such as stress, anxiety, and depression reduce with regular practice (Fjorback et al., 2011; Chang, 2021; Upadhyay et al., 2022).\nWhile there are many different meditative traditions and practices, each of which may have differential effects on physiology and health (Tang et al., 2015; Brandmeyer et al., 2019), there are some similarities in the delivery patterns. For example, mind body interventions such as Mindfulness Based Stress\nReduction (MBSR), which originated from Buddhist traditions, are similar to Inner Engineering Online (IEO) distilled from ancient yogic traditions. Both practices are multi-component programs that incorporate multiple psychological techniques (e.g., perception and cognitive reappraisals), body movements (modified Hatha Yoga and other body work such as Tai Chi and Qi Kong), and several types of meditation (e.g., body scan, mindful eating, Loving-Kindness meditation).\nInner Engineering Online is a multicomponent program, that engages participants in meditation and yogic practices. It is designed to improve an individual\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional health and is a pre-requisite for enrolling in the Inner Engineering Completion Online (IECO) course (Chang, 2021; Upadhyay et al., 2022). The IECO course is a protocol under the Isha school of yoga and involves learning a 21-min meditation, called Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya (Muralikrishnan et al., 2012; Peterson et al., 2017). This meditation practice involves controlled breathing techniques (Pranayama) and mantra chanting (AUM chanting), followed by breath watching meditation.\nThis study investigates the effects of the IECO program on stress and sleep quality, hypothesizing that the former will decrease, and the latter will increase with regular practice. It is important to note that the absence of stress does not guarantee the presence of well-being. Therefore, the study also investigates whether participants would experience improvements in various aspects of overall well-being, specifically positive emotions, engagement in work and relationships, and the presence of meaning in one\u2019s activities.\nInner Engineering Completion used to be an in-person program like the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction format before the SARS-COV-2 outbreak, and often required travel or time off from work. It has been noted that vacations have an ameliorating effect on stress, and that this may be a part of the positive effects of meditation retreats (Epel et al., 2016; Blasche et al., 2021). Therefore, studying the IECO program, which is incorporated into daily life without traveling or taking time off from work is a unique opportunity to test the efficacy of online delivery of a meditation program, and distinguish the effects of the course from any \u201cvacation effect.\u201d"

Any individual who could read and understand English and showed an interest in completing the IECO program by enrolling for the course with the Isha foundation, could participate in the study. Exclusion criteria included participants below 18 years of age and non-US resident.\nRecruitment was done by sharing the study\u2019s REDCap survey link via advertisement emails and participants self-reported on the eligibility criteria (REDCap is an online electronic data capture database).\nUpon consent, participants were asked to respond to the remotely administered survey at the following time points: at Baseline (T1), upon IECO completion (T2), and 6 weeks after IECO completion (T3). These surveys included validated questionnaires assessing stress [Perceived Stress Score (PSS)], sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)], mindfulness [Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)-short scale], and the Positive Emotion/Relationship/Engagement Scale (PERMA) profiler scale, which comprises the following well-being indicators: positive and negative emotions, engagement, relationship, meaning, accomplishment, and health (Figure 1).\nSelf-reported medical history and any history of addiction or substance abuse (such as alcohol consumption/smoking) along with a 2-min, weekly compliance survey between T2 and T3 were also included. The compliance survey collected information on the frequency and duration of the prescribed practices."

IEO consists of seven online lessons (90-min per session) which involves engaging in intellectual inquiry (resulting in cognitive reappraisal), generating positive emotions, learning Upa Yoga (preparatory Hatha Yoga involving body movement and breathwork), and activation of inner energy (sound and postural yoga) (Sadhguru, 2016). This intervention is a pre-requisite to participate in the IECO program.\nInner Engineering Completion Online involves learning Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya. This practice is performed for 21 min daily and includes multiple controlled breathing techniques (Pranayama), Aum chanting, and the engagement of bandhas (muscular locks in the abdomen and pelvic floor) applied for 15 min. The practice concludes with about 5 min of breath-watching meditation (Peterson et al., 2017)."

Both decreases in PSS scores remained significant in the adjusted model (refer to Figure 2 and Table 2B).\nAmong the mind body intervention (MBI\u2019s), MBSR has demonstrated strong evidence in reducing stress in healthy adult population (Bartlett et al., 2019). In traditional MBSR, participants learn different methods of meditation (body scan, awareness of breathing sensations, loving-kindness) and mindful movements (modified Hatha yoga and other bodywork) while sharing their experiences in a group setting. Typically, MBSR program spans 8 weeks and includes weekly 2.5-h classes, a day-long retreat, and prescribed homework and daily practices with audio guide, including a minimum of 40 min of meditation. Participants are free to choose any intervention they wish to pursue over time. IECO on the contrary offers a more structured approach to its novice participants. Following initiation into the practices, participants are asked to repeat a set of practices including pranayama (breath work), aum chanting and meditation twice daily. Each session last for 21 min at\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 814224\nleast and participants are advised to practice the intervention routinely for a at least 6 weeks. Our study demonstrated that IECO practices resulted in a significant reduction in perceived stress despite online delivery of the intervention and a lack of rigor (e.g., weekly classes, prescribed homework) noted in traditional MBSR delivery.\nNext, it has been noted that vacations have an ameliorating effect on stress, and that this may be a part of the positive effects of meditation retreats (Epel et al., 2016; May et al., 2020; Blasche et al., 2021). Vacations result in positive health effects by reducing exhaustion and improving satisfaction. However, these changes are not permanent and fade out upon resumption of routine life (de Bloom et al., 2009). Gilbert et al. (2014) conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the changes in stress and wellbeing reported by non-meditators attending a yoga retreat vs. vacationing in the same resort. They noted that although both groups reported a decline in stress and improvement in overall well-being, only retreat participants showed decreased rumination and better control over stressors (Gilbert et al., 2014).\nThe vacation effect\u2019 is unlikely to be the primary driver of the reduction in perceived stress in this study, given it is\n*Significant at Alpha = 0.05. aNegative correlation indicates successful impact of meditation practice: i.e.: PSS decreased, and positive affect measures increased. bPositive correlation indicates successful impact of meditation practice: Both PSS and negative affect measures decreased.\nshort-term (Blasche et al., 2021) and because this program was conducted online amid a pandemic. Therefore, although there have been studies on the effect of this program on perceived stress before (Peterson et al., 2017), the present study is the first to our knowledge that possibly accounts for the \u201cvacation effect.\u201d Overall, these results suggest that the IECO program is associated with a reduction in perceived stress, a finding in line with the literature on meditation (Lee et al., 2007; Goyal et al., 2014; Khalsa, 2015; Edwards et al., 2018)."

            "text": "Analogous to the cognitive reappraisal techniques taught in MBSR, IEO which is a pre-requisite for IECO requires its participants to employ logic-based self-inquiry. This investigation of everyday human experiences is often accompanied by humorous wisdom-based stories (Sadhguru, 2016). Gaining the ability to reappraise one\u2019s internal mental and physiological processes and external situations and social relations one encounters reduced autonomic reactivity to internal and external stressors.\nMindful attention awareness scale scores increased at all time points (refer to Figure 4), suggesting increased mindfulness over time. Mindfulness is described as a heightened state of nonjudgmental awareness of one\u2019s mental activity and other sensory experiences. A state of mindfulness has been associated with greater feelings of well-being possibly due to the predominance of sense experience over rumination when it is achieved. MAAS scores suggest higher levels of mindfulness levels correlate with lower levels of the neuroticism personality trait, and are inversely correlated with depression, self-consciousness and angry hostility (Brown and Ryan, 2003). Therefore, increasing their levels of mindfulness may be a means for the participants to better selfregulate internal states by increasing non-judgmental awareness and reducing rumination."

This is in line with several studies reported in the literature (Khalsa, 2015; Cavanagh et al., 2018; Edwards et al., 2018; Allen et al., 2021).\nUnfortunately, disproportionate amount of focus is applied to dysfunctional psychiatric issues such as anxiety and depression while, positive psychological outcomes such as emotional intelligence, positive emotions, vitality, flourishing, and life satisfaction and work-related outcomes such as job performance and work engagement await more research (Lomas et al., 2019). Among the MBI\u2019s, only interventions that focus on LovingKindness Meditation (LKM) have demonstrated a medium effect size on daily positive emotion (Zeng et al., 2015).\nInterestingly, a meta-analysis of meditation studies found weak to moderate evidence for the reducing stress after meditation but did not find any effect on positive affect or wellbeing (Goyal et al., 2014). The difference may be accounted for because the meta-analysis only included participants with a\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 814224\ndiagnosed clinical condition.

However, the difference in sleep quality was only statistically significant between Baseline and post-IECO and baseline and the week-six follow up (refer to Table 3A). Perhaps a floor effect may account for the lack of a significant difference between the post-IECO, and week-six follow up time points. Furthermore, there was no significant time effect to this decrease in the adjusted model (refer to Table 3B). This is in accordance with the current literature (Rusch et al., 2019). One randomized control trial found, for example, that older adults assigned to a mindful awareness practice showed more significant improvements on the PSQI than those assigned to sleep hygiene education (Black et al., 2015). These subjective reports were validated by polysomnography in another randomized control trial (Guerra et al., 2020)."

            "text": "Various flexible delivery methods have been experimented, ranging from blended learning (classroom meeting combined with online practices or e-coaching) to completely online, videoconferencing, or audio tracks. However, most MBIs are still taught in face-to-face group format (Bartlett et al., 2019). Vonderlin et al. (2020) observe that 79% of the programs (79%) are delivered in-person, followed by online programs (13%), combinations of online and in-class elements (7%), or via audio records (1%). A recent review of online MBSR in non-work settings found equivalent effects of online to those of face-toface class-based training (Lomas et al., 2019). As previously mentioned, this is the first time IECO is being offered in an online format and therefore, this study adds to the growing literature on meditation by providing evidence that, even when taught online, meditation is associated with decreased perceived stress, improved subjective sleep quality and better outcomes in various aspects of well-being, including health, engagement, and relationships. However, flexible delivery modes, such as online or app, have been under-investigated and presents an opportunity for research to examine the effectiveness of online or app-based program in greater details."

            "text": "The strengths of this study lie in its assessment of a wide range of measures of well-being, its longitudinal design, which allowed for a time-effect analysis, and in type of intervention (remote), which allowed for an accounting of the vacation effect.\nThe primary limitation of this study is its observational design. It has been noted that studies without randomization or active control are subject to biases and self-selection (Chambless and Hollon, 1998). Individuals who exert effort or expend time and resources to join a meditation retreat believe that meditation will positively affect them. When studies do not include objective measurements, self-reports can be colored\nby personal biases. To promote objective assessment in our study, validated neuropsychological scales were employed as outcome measures at the study design phase. Because of the ongoing pandemic, we could not verify subject compliance with objective, physiological measures and thus had to rely on the subjects\u2019 self-reports of compliance. Statistical analysis employing repeated observations in the same individuals over a six-week time frame was intended to improve data analysis rigor of the self-reports and mitigate the lack of randomization and control group.\nAnother limitation was participant attrition (30\u201340% at each time point and 59% from Baseline to the week six follow-up.) This is in line with the other mindfulness studies, which had attrition rates ranging from 8\u201360% (Spijkerman et al., 2016; Cavanagh et al., 2018). An analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes of those participants that left the study between the post-IECO and week six follow up time points was conducted to see if they experienced changes between the baseline and post-IECO timepoints. Participants still experienced significant decreases in perceived stress and increases in mindfulness and sleep quality (Supplementary Tables A, B). Conversely, none of the PERMA scale sub-sections showed a significant change, except for Meaning and Health. These results suggest that study participants did not drop out of the study because they believed the intervention had no effect, and that both positive and negative emotions, as well as the other positive effects, may require more time to change than perceived stress. Future studies should attempt to control attrition bias by incentivizing participants to complete study protocols or including weekly refresher interventions.\nFuture studies should focus on a robust design\u2014ideally a randomized control trial\u2014and the mechanisms of action for the beneficial effects of this style of meditation. Focusing on inflammatory mediators, cortisol, or epinephrine and norepinephrine may provide supporting evidence to participants\u2019 self-reports. Other means of investigating the mechanism of action would be by looking at heart rate variability, which is a measure of sympathetic nervous system activation and could be affected by meditation (Libby et al., 2012; Muralikrishnan et al., 2012; Koerten et al., 2020) or the anterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the activation of which is associated with meditation-related reduction of anxiety (Zeidan et al., 2014). An exciting direction for meditation research would be to investigate the mechanism by which meditation may affect sleep architecture and quality (Maruthai et al., 2016).\nFurthermore, the Inner Engineering Online program contains sessions of intellectual discussions on how to frame life events and stressors, be \u201cjoyful by your own nature,\u201d and 21-min meditation practice to be performed daily. This meditation practice can be broken down into individual steps of breath regulation, mantra chanting, and focused attention meditation. Future studies on this practice should investigate whether these steps have unique effects.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 814224"
