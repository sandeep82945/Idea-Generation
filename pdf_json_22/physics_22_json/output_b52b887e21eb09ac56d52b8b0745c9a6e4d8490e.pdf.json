    "abstractText": "This study proposes a method for predicting the wind direction against the simple automobile model (Ahmed model) and the surface pressure distributions on it by using data-driven optimized sparse pressure sensors. Positions of sparse pressure sensor pairs on the Ahmed model were selected for estimation of the yaw angle and reconstruction of pressure distributions based on the time-averaged surface pressure distributions database of various yaw angles, whereas the symmetric sensors in the left and right sides of the model were assumed. The surface pressure distributions were obtained by pressure-sensitive paint measurements. Three algorithms for sparse sensor selection based on the greedy algorithm were applied, and the sensor positions were optimized. The sensor positions and estimation accuracy of yaw angle and pressure distributions of three algorithms were compared and evaluated. The results show that a few optimized sensors can accurately predict the yaw angle and the pressure distributions.",

            "text": "The automotive industry is currently undergoing a once-in-a-century transformation, and various research and technological developments are being actively conducted to address energy and environmental issues and to improve safety performance. Moreover, automated driving, electrification, and connectedness of automobiles will enable the creation of unprecedented new value. One approach to advanced automotive functionalization is the adaptive control of the vehicle and airflow around the vehicle. In a real vehicle driving environment, natural winds are present and vehicle speed varies constantly. When a vehicle runs at high speed, aerodynamic drag is the largest factor in fuel consumption (Hucho and Sovran, 1993), and reduction of vehicle aerodynamic drag is indispensable for improving fuel efficiency. Especially in batteryelectric vehicles (BEV), which will become mainstream in the future, reducing aerodynamic drag is crucial to ensure maximum range within a given battery (Andwari et al., 2017). On the other hand, aerodynamics caused by crosswinds causes accidents due to overturning, sideslip, and rotation accidents (Baker, 1986). The action of crosswinds changes the three-dimensional structure of the flow around the vehicle and the aerodynamic characteristics (Krajnovic\u0301 et al., 2012; Bello-Milla\u0301n et al., 2016; Meile et al., 2016; Tunay et al., 2018). Particular attention should be paid to unsteady crosswinds, such as gusts, which generate unsteady aerodynamic forces (Volpe et al., 2014). The appropriate control for crosswinds around a vehicle and solutions to these problems can improve driving comfortability, energy efficiency, and safety.\nAdaptive vehicle control can be achieved through the steering, throttling, braking, and flow control. For flow control, active flow control that can adjust inputs appropriately is effective for adaptive control. Active flow control is a method that uses a vehicle\u2019s electrical power to operate, which does not require any changes to the vehicle geometry. Active flow control includes various methods such as movable underbody diffuser, steady blowing, pulsed jet, steady suction, and plasma actuator, which can reduce weight and size, and thus, reduce the negative impact on vehicle performance (Mukut and Abedin, 2019). There are many studies, both experimental and numerical, on the application of active flow control to automobiles. For example, McNally et al. (2015) attempted to control the fluid flow by steady jets using the flat back Honda Simplified Body in numerical and experimental approaches. Bideaux et al. (2011) attempted to control the fluid flow by pulsed jet using the Ahmed model in an experimental approach. Wassen and Thiele (2009) attempted to control the fluid flow by combining suction and blowing using the Ahmed model in a numerical approach. Boucinha et al. (2011) attempted to control the fluid flow by plasma actuators using the Ahmed model in an experimental approach. These studies have shown that active fluid control can reduce drag by 20% (Mukut and Abedin, 2019; Bideaux et al., 2011).\nThe pressure distribution on the surface of a vehicle changes depending on the wind direction relative to the vehicle (Yamashita et al., 2007). This paper proposes methods for estimating the flow direction (yaw angle) and pressure distribution on a vehicle surface using pressure sensors installed around it. Unlike conventional airflow inclination measurement methods such as the multi-hole probe and angle of attack vane, the proposed method can reconstruct the pressure distribution and obtain more detailed information about the flow field.\nSince the total weight, the space for wiring, and the installation cost of sensors are limited, it is desirable to install sparse sensors. It is necessary to optimize the position of the sensors in order to accurately estimate the yaw angle and the pressure distribution with sparse sensors. Therefore, the data-driven sparse sampling proposed by Saito et al. (2021b) is applied in this paper. The data-driven sparse sampling is a technique for reconstructing full data from observation point information, and the observation point positions are optimized using training data (Manohar et al., 2018; Loiseau et al., 2018; Manohar et al., 2021; Saito et al., 2021a). Recently, the sensor optimization methods for this purpose have been intentionally investigated by Clark et al. (2018, 2020a,b); Yamada et al. (2021a,b); Nakai et al. (2021); Nagata et al. (2021); Nakai et al. (2022); Fukami et al. (2021); Carter et al. (2021); Li et al. (2021b,a); Nagata et al. (2022a,b); Inoue et al. (2022). The data-driven sparse sampling method can identify and estimate the flow field at a low computational cost. Zhou et al. (2021) succeeded in the real-time identification of inflow aerodynamic parameters, such as the flow separation situation, angle of attack, and inflow velocity. Classifying the flow field is expected to be applied to optimal feedback control (Deem et al., 2020; Kanda et al., 2021, submitted). In addition, Kaneko et al. (2021) attempted to reconstruct the propagation time and attenuation rate distributions of each sound source grid point to a microphone, which are required for beamforming, using the reduced-order model with sparse sampling for the acceleration of the computation. Furthermore, it should be noted that the data-driven sparse sampling has recently been applied to the online temperature fields reconstruction of steam turbine casing (Jiang et al., 2022), to the fast computation of inverse transient analysis for pipeline condition assessment (Wang, 2022), and to the improvement of signal-to-noise ratio in noisy measurement (Inoue et al., 2021).\nFor the optimization of the sparse sensor positions, pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) is useful for the measurement of the surface pressure distributions, which are the training data. PSP is a type of fluorescent paint that produces luminescence according to the partial pressure of oxygen when irradiated with excitation light. Utilizing this feature, the pressure distribution can be obtained by exciting the PSP applied to the model and measuring it with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Liu et al., 2021). This technique is actively used in the aeronautical field (e.g. Merienne et al., 2013; Watkins et al., 2016; Sugioka et al., 2018; Masini et al., 2020; Uchida et al., 2021). The low-pressure conditions (Anyoji et al., 2015; Nagata et al., 2020a,b; Kasai et al., 2021) and rarefied and/or microflows (Niimi et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2015, 2020) are also scopes of application. Since the PSP is an absolute pressure sensor, it is generally difficult to accurately measure the pressure by PSP at low- speed conditions such as automotive aerodynamics in which pressure changes are small. However, low-speed PSP measurement has been becoming possible through various efforts such as temperature correction of PSP using thermocouples (Yamashita et al., 2007), optimization of images acquisition timing (Brown, 2000; Bell, 2004; Mitsuo et al., 2005) and number (Yorita, 2012), and use of new paint with less temperature dependence (Gouterman et al., 2004). Therefore, research applying PSP measurement to automobile models is also being conducted (e.g. Yamashita et al., 2007; Aider et al., 2001; Gouterman et al., 2004; Engler et al., 2002). Furthermore, the recent development of the PSP and data\nscience techniques, such as fast Fourier transform (FFT), proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) (Berkooz et al., 1993; Taira et al., 2017), and sparse sampling, have made low-speed unsteady PSP measurements possible. For example, Egami et al. (2020) developed a novel ruthenium complex-based fast-PSP and succeeded in obtaining time-series data of pressure fluctuation with high accuracy even at a mean velocity of 20 m/s. Peng et al. (2016) applied POD analysis to low-speed unsteady PSP data and confirmed POD analysis could effectively remove noise. Wen et al. (2018) developed a data mining approach based on compressed data fusion and succeeded in recovering the unsteady pressure field induced by a cylinder wake flow at low speed from the highly noisy PSP data. In addition to these, there are many other studies that have taken on the challenge of low-speed unsteady PSP measurements (e.g. Inoue et al., 2021; Sugioka et al., 2019; Noda et al., 2018; Ozawa et al., 2019).\nIn this study, the Ahmed model (Ahmed et al., 1984), also known as the simple automobile model, is used to validate the proposed framework. The flow around an Ahmed model is representative of the flow around the actual vehicle and is a good reference for the investigation of the aerodynamic characteristics of the actual vehicle (Yu and Bingfu, 2021). There are a number of studies on the elucidation of the flow structure around an automobile using the Ahmed model, both experimental (e.g. Ahmed et al., 1984; Thacker et al., 2012; Tunay et al., 2016) and numerical (e.g. Krajnovic\u0301 and Davidson, 2005; Guilmineau, 2008; Corallo et al., 2015; Keogh et al., 2016). The effects of vehicle spacing (Watkins and Vino, 2008) and overtaking (Uystepruyst and Krajnovic\u0301, 2013) on aerodynamics have also been investigated with the Ahmed model. In this study, time-averaged pressure distribution data on an Ahmed model at various yaw angles are obtained by the PSP measurement as training data, and sparse sensor position optimization is performed for the yaw angle estimation and the pressure distribution reconstruction. Three different sensor position optimization algorithms based on the greedy algorithm are applied, and the sensor positions selected by each algorithm and the relationship between the number of sensors and the estimation error of the pressure distribution and the yaw angle are discussed."

            "text": "This study uses the time-averaged pressure coefficient CP distribution data on the left and right sides of the Ahmed model at various yaw angles. Here, a data vector of pixel units, converted from the luminescence intensity captured by PSP images, is represented as the CP distribution. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the yaw angle estimation and pressure distribution reconstruction. The p-sparse pressure sensor pairs are installed at the same position on the left and right sides of the model. Here, the symmetric sensors in the left and right sides of the model were assumed, and therefore, the term \u201csensor pair\u201d represents the sensors symmetrically placed on the left and right sides of the body in this study. The yaw angle is estimated and the pressure distribution is reconstructed from the observed values y from the sensors. The optimization of the placement of the sparse pressure sensors corresponds to the problem of choosing the pixel to be observed. Here, the number of sensor pairs is reduced by using a common sensor for the yaw angle estimation and the\npressure distribution reconstruction.\nThe yaw angle is positive counterclockwise. Therefore, when the yaw angle is positive, the left side is leeward. When PSP measurements are conducted on the left side of the model for each yaw angle from \u2212\u03d5l to \u03d5l, the vector that stores the yaw angle \u03c6 \u2208 Rm is defined as follows:\n\u03c6 = [ \u03c61 \u03c62 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6m ]T = [ \u2212\u03d5l \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212\u03d51 0 \u03d51 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03d5l ]T ,\n(1)\nwhere l = (m\u2212 1) /2 and \u03c6l+1 = \u03d50 = 0. Here, the superscript T represents the transpose of the matrix. The pressure data matrix on the left side Xleft \u2208 Rn\u00d7m is defined as follows:\nXleft = [ x1 x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xm ] , (2)\nwhere xj \u2208 Rn is a column vector of the time-averaged pressure distribution on the left side at an arbitrary yaw angle. The subscript number j of \u03c6j corresponds to that of xj .\nDue to the assumption of the symmetry of the left and right sides, the pressure data matrix of the right\nside Xright \u2208 Rn\u00d7m can be written as:\nXright = [ xm xm\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 x1 ] . (3)\nHysteresis is not considered in this method.\nThe sensor position is determined by the sensor position optimization algorithm using \u03c6,Xleft,Xright as the training data. The k-th sensor pair defines the sensor position vector hk \u2208 Rn using the sensor index ik as follows:\nhk (i) =  1 (i = ik)0 (i 6= ik) (4) Here, hk is a sparse column vector where the element corresponding to the k-th sensor position is 1 and the other elements are 0. In this case, the sensor position matrix H \u2208 Rp\u00d7n and the sensor-pair position matrix extended to symmetric layout \u03a0 \u2208 R2p\u00d72n can be written as follows:\nH = [ h1 h2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 hp ]T , (5)\n\u03a0 = h1 0 h2 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 hp 0 0 h1 0 h2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 hp T . (6) Sensor position optimization is performed using the vectors and the matrices defined above, and thus, the yaw angle estimation and the pressure distribution reconstruction are conducted."

Since the time-averaged PSP measurement noise can be assumed to be sufficiently small, least-squares regression is available for estimation. It should be noted that the estimation based on least-squares regression may not be appropriate when the measurement includes outliers and/or is strongly contaminated. In such cases, it is necessary to apply a method such as the `1 regression or the compressed sensing (Wen et al., 2018)."

Here, POD is one of the effective methods for extracting significant modes from high-dimensional data. If the data can be effectively expressed by a limited number of POD modes, limited sensors placed at appropriate positions will give the approximated full state information by estimating the POD mode coefficients.

Therefore, switching the algorithm to the DG-vector algorithm when the OMP algorithm overfits can be expected to further improve performance. Thus, we tried the OMP-DG hybrid algorithm (hereafter, the hybrid algorithm), which uses the OMP algorithm to select from first to q-th sensor pairs and the DG-vector algorithm to select from (q+ 1)-th to p-th sensor pairs in this study. Here, q represents the number of sensor pairs to which the OMP algorithm overfits, and is determined based on the selected sensor pair positions and/or the relationship between the number of sensor pairs and the estimation error.\nThe hybrid algorithm is summarized in Alg. 3. The hybrid algorithm uses the index of q sensor pairs selected by the OMP algorithm to determine the next sensors by the DG-vector algorithm. Therefore, the position of the first sensor pair selected by the DG-vector algorithm and the position of the (q+ 1)-th sensor pair selected by the hybrid algorithm are not the same.\nIn this way, a combination of the greedy algorithms such as the OMP and DG-vector algorithms, which determine one sensor-pair position at each step, is straightforward.

The model used in this study was a 1/10 scaled Ahmed model (Ahmed et al., 1984) and the schematic of the model is shown in Fig. 3. The length L, the width W , and the height H of the model were 104.4 mm, 38.9 mm, and 28.8 mm, respectively, and the rear slant angle \u03b8 is 25 deg. On the left side of the model, there were five pressure taps (x/L =0.15, 0.25, 0.4 0.6, and 0.81), which were connected to the pressure transducers (30 INCH-D1-4V-MINI, Amphenol All Sensors) through tubes, to compare with PSP results. UniFIB and FIB Basecoat (Innovative Scientific Solutions Incorporated, ISSI) were painted on the left side of the model. UniFIB is a commercially available PSP, and FIB Basecoat is an undercoat for UniFIB.

The left side of the model is the leeward and windward sides when the yaw angle is negative and positive, respectively.

In addition, Fig. 5 shows the structure of the CP distribution at \u03c6 = 25 deg (upper) and the CP profile on the white dashed line in CP distribution (lower). As the yaw angle increases, the CP on the entire surface on the left side decreases, and a low-pressure region is formed at the upstream side of the model (L1) and near the front legs (L2). These low-pressure regions expand downstream as the yaw angle increases. In the case of \u03c6 = 15 deg, the low-pressure region at the top of the model (L3) becomes noticeable and becomes stronger as the yaw angle increases. The characteristics of the CP distribution obtained in this experiment are qualitatively consistent with the results of the previous study (Yorita, 2012) obtained under the same conditions.\nThe error of the PSP measurement at an arbitrary yaw angle in this experiment \u2206CP,RMS,j was calculated\nas shown bellow:\n\u2206CP,RMS,j = \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a1 t \u03c4\u2211 t=1 (CP,PSP,t,j \u2212 CP,tap,t,j)2, (26)\nwhere, \u03c4 , CP,PSP, and CP,tap is the number of pressure taps, the pressure coefficient obtained by PSP around the pressure taps, and the pressure coefficient obtained by the pressure taps, respectively. The mean and standard deviation of \u2206CP,RMS,j were 0.059 and 0.018, respectively. Furthermore, Fig. 5 shows that the shot noise in the PSP measurement data is sufficiently small, which means that these datasets can be used as training data.\nFigures 6(a)\u2013(c) show the distributions of the mean pressure coefficient xboth, the standard deviation of Xleft, and the coefficient of determination between \u03c6 and Xdif , respectively. The coefficient of determination, which is calculated as the square of the correlation coefficient between \u03c6 and each row of Xdif , represents\nthe strength of the linear correlation between yaw angle and the differential pressure between the left and right sides. The distribution of the standard deviation shown in Fig. 6(b) indicates that the pressure change due to the change in the yaw angle is large in the upstream part of the model, particularly in the region near the front legs. On the other hand, the pressure change is small in the downstream part of the model. The distribution of the coefficient of determination shown in Fig.6(c) indicates that the linear correlation between \u03c6 and xdif,i is particularly strong in the upstream part of the model.\nFigure 7 shows the POD modes of X\u0303both calculated by Eq. (14). The odd-numbered spatial POD modes have positive and negative reversals on the left and right sides, while the even-numbered spatial POD modes are identical on the left and right sides. Therefore, the POD coefficients for odd- and even-number modes are antisymmetric and symmetric regarding the yaw angle, respectively. Subfigure (a) shows the contribution rate of the first mode is dominant at 95.7%, indicating that the POD efficiency of this data is high. In addition, subfigure (b) shows a strong correlation between the first mode coefficient and the yaw angle. Therefore, most of the changes in the pressure field due to changes in yaw angle are represented by the first mode. These mean that the low-dimensional model works well for the sparse sensor placement and the estimations. The sum of the contribution rates of the first to fourth modes is 99.7%, and the number of modes r for the low-dimensional model of the CP distribution was set to four in the following discussion."

The selected order of sensor pairs is displayed with the sensors. In addition, the lower figures in Fig. 8 show the input of CP at each sensor point and each yaw angle. Here, the result of the random selection method is one trial example and shown as the reference.\nThe OMP algorithm selected the first sensor pair position in which the pressure change has the strongest linear correlation with the yaw angle. The coefficient of determination at the first sensor pair point was 0.999. On the other hand, the OMP algorithm selected the point with the smaller pressure change after the second sensor pair position. This is because the OMP algorithm minimizes the residual of the estimated yaw angle at each step, and the linear correlation between the yaw angle and the pressure is strong at the first sensor pair position. The second and subsequent sensor pairs are fitted to the noise component of the pressure data, thus points with a small pressure change due to the yaw angle change were selected.\nThe DG-vector algorithm selected the first sensor pair at the lower part of the upstream side where the pressure change was large, and the second sensor pair was selected at the base of low-pressure region L3. The third and fourth sensor pairs were selected near the first and second sensor pairs. For all sensor pairs, the point with the large pressure change was selected.\nSince the pressure changes of the second and subsequent sensor pairs selected by the OMP algorithm were low, the hybrid algorithm was set to q = 1, and the second and subsequent sensor pairs were determined by the DG-vector algorithm. Therefore, the first sensor pair selected by the hybrid algorithm is the same as that selected by the OMP algorithm, and the second sensor pair selected by the hybrid algorithm is different from that selected by the OMP algorithm. The third and subsequent sensor pairs selected by the hybrid algorithm were chosen from the vicinity of sensor pair positions obtained by the DG-vector algorithm. For all sensor pairs, the points with the large pressure change were selected.\nThe CP distributions reconstructed by the DG-vector and hybrid algorithms (p = 2, 4) are almost the same as the original CP distribution in Fig, 4(k).

Here, r = 4 was set for the pressure distribution reconstruction, and q = 1 was set for the hybrid algorithm. The estimation error of the random selection method is averaged over 100 trials. The dashed line in Fig. 10 represents the error when observation is possible at all points is shown, and it corresponds to the error caused by constructing the low-dimensional model with four POD modes.\nFigure 9 illustrates that the estimation error of the yaw angles decreases as the number of sensor pairs increases for all algorithms in the validation I, but this is not the case in the validation II. The algorithms that minimize the error for two or more sensor pairs are the OMP algorithm for the validation I and the hybrid algorithm for the validation II, respectively. The increase in error due to the increase in the number of sensor pairs is caused by overfitting in validation II. As a result of fitting the estimation model to the noise component in the training data, the error increases for unknown data. In the OMP algorithm, the effect of overfitting is especially pronounced because the pressure changes of the second and subsequent sensor pairs are low. The hybrid algorithm, on the other hand, still selects sensitive points after the second sensor pair, and thus, the error of the hybrid algorithm in the validation II is expected to be smaller than that of the OMP algorithm. In terms of the yaw angle estimation, the minimum error is achieved with the single sensor pair selected by the OMP and hybrid algorithms, and the use of two or more sensor pairs hardly decreases the error.\nFigure 10, which shows the reconstruction error of the CP distribution, illustrates that the errors of the DG-vector and hybrid algorithms are lower than the PSP measurement error of 0.054 at the number of sensor pairs of two. The range of error bars is small, and the pressure distribution reconstruction is stable. In addition, the error hardly decreases even if the number of sensor pairs is three or more. On the other\nhand, when the number of sensor pairs is three, the reconstruction error obtained by the OMP algorithm is larger than that of randomly selected sensor pairs. Since the range of the error bar is also relatively large, the OMP algorithm is not suitable for pressure distribution reconstruction. The cases of two sensor pairs selected by the DG-vector and hybrid algorithms are optimal from the viewpoint of the pressure distribution reconstruction.\nThe results and the discussions above show that the case of the hybrid algorithm with two sensor pairs is\nmost suitable for yaw angle estimation and/or pressure distribution reconstruction."

            "text": "In this study, sparse sensor position optimization for yaw angle estimation and pressure distribution reconstruction was performed using the time-averaged pressure coefficient distribution data at various yaw angles on the Ahmed model surface acquired by the PSP measurements at various yaw angles. The linear regression for the yaw angle and the least-squares estimation of the POD mode coefficients, based on datadriven sparse sampling, were conducted. The pressure distributions were reconstructed by the estimated POD mode coefficients together with the spatial POD modes. Three different sensor position optimization algorithms, the OMP algorithm, the DG-vector algorithm, and the hybrid algorithm, which combines the previous two algorithms, were compared and evaluated. The objective functions of OMP and DG were the indices regarding the yaw angle estimation and the POD mode coefficient estimation, respectively. It should be noted that the symmetric sensors on the left and right sides of the model were assumed.\nThe selected sensor pair positions showed the characteristics of each algorithm. As a result of evaluating the generalization performance in terms of the yaw angle estimation, the OMP and hybrid algorithms with one sensor pair provided the smallest error, though there is no advantage in increasing the number of sensor pairs to two or more in the problem setting of this study due to overfitting. In terms of the pressure distribution reconstruction, the DG-vector and hybrid algorithms with two sensor pairs are effective. These results indicate that the hybrid algorithm with two sensor pairs is the most effective for the yaw angle estimation and/or the pressure distribution reconstruction. This suggests the effectiveness of combining multiple greedy algorithms for different objectives. Synergistic effects can be expected by understanding the characteristics of each algorithm and combining them appropriately.\nThe technique proposed in this study can be applied not only to the Ahmed model but also to other vehicle body shapes. Once a pressure database is obtained either by an experiment or numerical analysis as in this study, sensor pair positions that effectively estimate the yaw angle and the reconstructed pressure distribution can be systematically obtained. Furthermore, in addition to the yaw angle estimation and the pressure distribution reconstruction, other physical quantities such as flow velocity can be estimated by applying this technology. However, it should be noted that we proposed a data-driven method in this study, and it is not expected to work properly under the conditions that the input is extrapolated from training data, for example, when the yaw angle of the wind direction is 30 degrees, when there is a pitch angle, or\nwhen the wind speed is significantly different. These will be the subject of challenging future research."
