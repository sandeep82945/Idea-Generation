    "abstractText": "In this article we calculate the energy of an impurity weakly coupled to a spin 1/2 fermionic superfluid. We show that the divergences resulting from three-body physics can only be cured using a proper description of the excitations of the many-body background. We highlight the crucial role played by interactions between quasiparticles which are overlooked within BCS (Bardeen-CooperSchrieffer) mean-field theory of fermionic superfluidity. By contrast, we prove that their addition using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) allows us to regularize the energy of the impurity. Finally, we show that these beyond mean-field corrections should be observable by the analysis of the frequency shift of the impurity center of mass oscillations in an external confining potential.",

Leyronas1\n1Laboratoire de physique de l\u2019Ecole Normale supe\u0301rieure, ENS, Universite\u0301 PSL, CNRS, Sorbonne Universite\u0301, Universite\u0301 de Paris, F-75005 Paris, France.\nIn this article we calculate the energy of an impurity weakly coupled to a spin 1/2 fermionic superfluid. We show that the divergences resulting from three-body physics can only be cured using a proper description of the excitations of the many-body background. We highlight the crucial role played by interactions between quasiparticles which are overlooked within BCS (Bardeen-CooperSchrieffer) mean-field theory of fermionic superfluidity. By contrast, we prove that their addition using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) allows us to regularize the energy of the impurity. Finally, we show that these beyond mean-field corrections should be observable by the analysis of the frequency shift of the impurity center of mass oscillations in an external confining potential.\nI. INTRODUCTION AND MAIN RESULTS\nThe concept of quasi-particle provides a simple and powerful framework for the study of the low-energy physics of complex many-body systems. In practice, a quasi-particle can be described as a free particle dressed by a cloud of excitations of the surrounding many-body medium leading to a renormalization of its physical properties, and most notably its mass.\nThis mechanism was first suggested by Landau and Pekar to describe the coupling of electrons to the vibration modes of a crystal lattice (the so-called polaron problem) [1] and since then has been generalized to a host of physical situations, from solid state physics where polarons play a crucial role in the study a photovoltaic materials [2], to nuclear physics [3].\nIn the recent years, mixtures of ultracold atoms have provided an ideal playground for the study of polaron physics [4]. In this context, two simple systems were studied. Firstly, an analogous of Landau-Pekar polaron was obtained by immersing an impurity in a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) - the so-called Bose-polaron [5\u20137]. In this case, the bogoliubov spectrum describing the low-lying excitations of the BEC possess a structure that is similar to the phonons of a crystal. Another simple situation was obtained by considering the case of a particle swimming in a sea of non-interacting spin-polarized fermions, the so-called Fermi polaron [8\u2013 14] that was also realized in exciton-polariton systems [15].\nA generalization of these two polaronic model systems is provided by the study of an impurity immersed in an ensemble of attractive spin 1/2 fermions [16\u201318]. When the attraction between the particles of the medium is varied, the ground state of the many-body background evolves from an ideal gas of fermions to a Bose-Einstein condensate of strongly bound dimers, thus realizing the\n\u2217Electronic address: Corresponding author: arnaud.bigue@phys.ens.fr\ncelebrated BEC-BCS crossover [19]. As a consequence, the state describing the impurity immersed in a fermionic superfluid interpolates between the Fermi and Bosepolarons. While in reported experiments, the impurity is weakly coupled to the medium and most can be captured quantitatively by treating the impurity-fermion interaction within a mean-field approximation, a theoretical study of beyond-mean field effects was initiated in [20\u201322] that highlighted the role of three-body interactions. In particular, [22] showed that the leading order corrections were related to the compressibility of the background medium after a regularisation of UV divergences made possible by the introduction of explicit 3- body interactions [23].\nBuilding on this work, we show here that a precise description of the properties of the background is required for the regularization procedure used in [22] to be effective. Indeed, describing the background superfluid within BCS approximation that considers only pairbreaking excitations is incompatible with this renormalization scheme. To obtain a finite beyond-mean field correction, we need to take into account collective modes of the system, and for this we work within the framework of the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [24\u201326] that allows us to make quantitative predictions for the energy of the impurity.\nMore precisely, consider an impurity of mass mi immersed in a many-body ensemble of spin 1/2 fermions of mass mf . a and a\n\u2032 are respectively the fermion-fermion and impurity-fermion scattering lengths (the latter being assumed to be spin independent). We note |\u03b1\u3009 the eigenstates of the medium in the absence of impurity, and E\u03b1 the corresponding eigenenergies. By convention, \u03b1 = 0 corresponds to the ground state. For a total density n of fermions, the state of the many-body background is characterized by the dimensionless parameter 1/kFa, where kF = (3\u03c0\n2n)1/3 is the Fermi wavector, the limits 1/kFa\u2192 \u2212\u221e (resp. +\u221e) corresponding respectively to the weakly (resp. strongly) attractive regimes.\nIn the quasi-particle picture, the low-lying energy of an impurity of momentum ~q takes the form of a free\nar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n03 22\n2v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .q\nua nt\n-g as\n] 7\nF eb\n2 02\n2\n2 particle dispersion relation\nE(q) = E0 + \u2206E + ~2q2\n2m\u2217 + o(q2). (1)\nwhere \u2206E is the interaction energy of the impurity with the many-body ensemble and m\u2217 is its effective mass.\nUsing perturbation theory, we have at second order in impurity-fermion coupling [22]\n1\nm\u2217 =\n1\nmi\n[ 1\u2212 4g \u20322n\n3\n\u222b d3q\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03b5(i)q \u03c73(q, \u03b5 (i) q )\n] (2)\n\u2206E = g\u2032n [ 1 + g\u2032 \u222b d3q\n(2\u03c0)3\n( 1\n\u03b5 (r) q\n\u2212 \u03c71(q, \u03b5(i)q )\n)] (3)\nHere, g\u2032 = 2\u03c0~2a\u2032/mr is the coupling constant of the impurity-medium two-body contact interaction, mr is the reduced mass of an impurity-fermion pair, \u03b5 (\u03b1=i,r) q = ~2q2/2m\u03b1 and\n\u03c7p(q, E) = 1\nN \u2211 \u03b1 |\u3008\u03b1|n\u0302q|0\u3009|2 (E + E\u03b1 \u2212 E0)p = (\u22121)p\u22121 (p\u2212 1)! \u2202p\u22121\u03c71 \u2202Ep\u22121 ,\n(4) where n\u0302q = \u2211 k,\u03c3 c \u2020 k,\u03c3ck+q,\u03c3 is the Fourier transform of the density operator and N is the total number of fermions. \u03c7p plays a central role in the following and we note that it depends only on the properties of the excitation spectrum of the many-body background and can be related to the density-density response function (see Sec. II).\nn\u0302q is an operator that transfers a momentum \u2212~q to the many-body system. For large q, we can assume that it couples the ground-state to free particle excitations for which E\u03b1 \u2212 E0 ' ~2q2/2mf . We therefore have\n\u03c7p(q, \u03b5 (i) q ) \u223c\nq\u2192\u221e\n1\nN \u2211 \u03b1 |\u3008\u03b1|n\u0302q|0\u3009|2( \u03b5 (r) q )p \u223c 1( \u03b5 (r) q\n)p . (5) As a consequence, we readily conclude that the sum appearing in the expression of the effective mass (Eq. (2)) is convergent and does not need any regularization. By contrast, the case of the interaction energy is more involved. Indeed, although \u03c71 and 1/\u03b5\n(r) compensate at leading order in Eq. (3), it was shown in [22] that the sum is log-divergent as a consequence of the following large momentum behaviour of \u03c71\n\u03c71(q, \u03b5 (i) q ) =\nq\u2192\u221e\n1\n\u03b5 (r) q\n[ 1\u2212 \u03c02\u03ba(\u03b7)mf\nmr\nC2 Nq + ...\n] , (6)\nwhere C2 is Tan\u2019s contact parameter of the many-body background [27], \u03b7 = mi/mf and\n\u03ba(\u03b7) =\n\u221a \u03b73(\u03b7 + 2)\n2\u03c03(\u03b7 + 1)2 \u2212 \u03b7 2\u03c03 arctan\n( 1\u221a\n\u03b7(\u03b7 + 2)\n)\n\u2212 4 \u03c03\n\u221a \u03b7\n\u03b7 + 2 arctan\n(\u221a \u03b7\n\u03b7 + 2\n)2 .\n(7)\nFollowing [23], this divergence can be regularized using an effective three-body interaction leading to the following regularized expression for the polaron energy shift\n\u2206E = g\u2032n [ 1+kFa \u2032F ( 1\nkFa ) \u2212 2\u03c0mf\nmr \u03ba(\u03b7) a\u2032C2 N ln(kFR3) + ...\n] , (8)\nwhere R3 is an effective length characterizing the threebody scattering amplitude (R3/a\n\u2032 ' 1.5 for the Lithium 6/Lithium 7 mixture used in [16]) and\nF\n( 1\nkFa\n) =\n\u039b\u2192\u221e\n2\u03c0\nkF\n[ ~2\nmr \u222b q<\u039b d3q (2\u03c0)3 ( 1 \u03b5 (r) q \u2212 \u03c71(q, \u03b5(i)q ) )\n\u2212 mf mr \u03ba(\u03b7) C2 N ln(\u039b/kF ) ] (9)\nTo calculate \u03c7p, a first approach is to use the extension of the BCS theory-a mean-field theory- to the whole BEC-BCS crossover [22]. In this case, we readily obtain\n\u03c7MF, p(q, E) = 1\nn\n\u222b d3k\n(2\u03c0)3 |ukvk+q + vkuk+q|2 (E + Ek + Ek+q) p , (10)\nwhere (uk, vk) are the amplitudes of the Bogoliubov modes and Ek their energy [28].\nHowever, this type of approximation scheme is restricted to the pair-breaking excitations sector and does not account for collective modes (phonons) that are dominant on the BEC side of the crossover. A well known consequence of this peculiarity is for instance that the compressibility calculated using BCS theory does not satisfy the f-sum rule. In our case, this leads to an underestimated value of \u03ba (the third term appearing in Eq. (7) is missing, see sec. III) which leads to a UV-divergence of F when \u039b\u2192\u221e and prevents the regularization of the energy of the impurity.\nHere, we solve this issue using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) that incorporates quasi-particles interactions and recovers the collectives modes of the system (knonwn as Bogoliubov-Anderson\u2019s modes in this context) [24, 25, 29]. In this framework, we will show that \u03c71 satisfies Eq. (6), with C2 being given by BCS mean-field value C2/N = m 2 f \u2206\n2/n (here \u2206 is the superconducting gap, see Sec. III). This allows us to regularize the polaron energy, leading to a universal function F displayed in Fig. 1. The numerical values obtained using\n3 RPA coincide with the asymptotic behaviours predicted in [22] for the BEC and BCS limits (1/kFa \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, orange solid lines): On the weakly attractive side, F converges towards the finite limit F (\u2212\u221e) = 3/2\u03c0 that can be calculated analytically for an ideal Fermi gas, while on the far BEC limit, we recover the asymptotic expansion imposed by the matching between the polaron energy with the mean-field interaction of an impurity with a Bose-Einstein condensate of deeply-bound dimers:\nF\n( 1\nkFa\n) =\na\u21920+ 8\u03c02\u03ba(\u03b7) mf mr ln (kFa) + Cad kFa + ... (11)\nwhere Cad comes from the analysis of the three-body scattering problem and depends only on the mass ratio \u03b7. Note that the resummation scheme used in [20] also yields the correct velue for \u03ba and is therefore compatible with the regularization procedure described previously. However this work incorporates quasi-particle interactions using only a scalar response function while the RPA considers a more general 3\u00d7 3 response matrix that describes the coupling to both density and order parameter \u2013 see section II below.\nLikewise, RPA can be used to calculate the secondorder correction to the effective mass. Using dimensional analysis, we have\n\u2206m mi = g\u20322n2 E2F G\u03b7(1/kFa). (12)\nThe plot of G1 is displayed in Fig.1, both within RPA and mean-field approximations. Both approaches coincide in the BCS limit where the excitation spectrum is dominated by pair-breaking excitations and where they asymptotically connect with the ideal gas prediction (orange line). In the BEC limit, the impurity is mostly dressed by a cloud of phonons. The BCS predictions therefore strongly underestimate the effective mass of the quasi-particle and RPA has to be used to obtain a quantitatively correct result. We see that in this regime the RPA prediction coincides with a calculation where the superfluid is described by a weakly repulsive BoseEinstein condensate of dimers whose low-lying excitation spectrum is dominated by Bogoliubov excitations (orange line, see also Sec. IV)."

            "text": "We now turn to a more detailed derivation of the results sketched in the previous secction. \u03c7p is the central quantity giving access to both the energy and the effective mass of the polaron. To calculate it, we first note that it can be related to the density-density response of the system \u03c7R. More precisely, let\u2019s consider the response of the superfluid to a perturbating potential V given by\nIn the linear regime, the density response can be written as \u3008n\u0302q\u3009 = \u2126u\u0303\u03c7Re\u2212i\u03c9t, where, using standard perturbation theory,\n\u03c7R(q, \u03c9) = 1\n\u2126 \u2211 \u03b16=0\n[ |\u3008\u03b1|n\u0302\u2212q|0\u3009|2\n\u03c9 + i0+ \u2212 (E\u03b1 \u2212 E0)\n\u2212 |\u3008\u03b1|n\u0302q|0\u3009| 2\n\u03c9 + i0+ + E\u03b1 \u2212 E0\n] ,\n(13)\nand \u2126 is a quantization volume ensuring that \u03c7R is an intensive quantity.\nWe note that \u03c71 is proportional to the second term of \u03c7R, and is associated with poles located on the negative part of the real axis. From this remark, we deduce that\n4 for E > 0\n\u03c71(q, E) = 1\nn \u222b +\u221e 0 d\u03c9\u2032 1 E + \u03c9\u2032 [ \u2212 1 \u03c0 =(\u03c7R(\u2212q, \u03c9\u2032)) ] (14)\nThe expression of \u03c7p for arbitrary p is then obtained by diferentiation with respect to E that yields\n\u03c7p(q, E) = 1\nn \u222b +\u221e 0 d\u03c9\u2032 1 (E + \u03c9\u2032)p [ \u2212 1 \u03c0 =(\u03c7R(\u2212q, \u03c9\u2032)) ] (15)\nWe now turn to actual calculation of \u03c7R of an ensemble of fermions with zero range interactions characterized by a scattering length a. The Hamiltonian describing the system is given by\nH = \u222b d3(r) \u2211 \u03c3=l \u03c8\u2020\u03c3(r) ( \u2212 ~ 2 2mf \u22072 \u2212 \u00b5 ) \u03c8\u2020\u03c3(r)\n+ g0 \u222b d3r\u03c8\u2020\u2191(r)\u03c8 \u2020 \u2193(r)\u03c8\u2193(r)\u03c8\u2191(r) (16)\nHere \u00b5 is the chemical potential and g0 is the bare coupling constant that we can relate to g = 4\u03c0~2a/mf using Lippman-Schwinger\u2019s equation\n1\ng0 =\n1 g \u2212 1 \u2126 \u2211 k 1 2\u03b5 (f) k . (17)\nA first approach to calculate the response of the system is to consider a mean-field approximation where we replace H by a quadratic Hamiltonian\nH0[U,\u2206] =\u222b d3(r) \u2211 \u03c3=l \u03c8\u2020\u03c3(r) ( \u2212 ~ 2 2mf \u22072 \u2212 \u00b5+ U(r) ) \u03c8\u2020\u03c3(r)\n+ \u222b d3r\u2206(r)\u03c8\u2020\u2191(r)\u03c8 \u2020 \u2193(r) + \u2206 \u2217(r)\u03c8\u2193(r)\u03c8\u2191(r). (18)\nThe optimal values for the Hartree potential U and the order parameter \u2206 are obtained variationally [28] and we have U = g0\u3008\u03c8\u2020\u2191\u03c8\u2191(r)\u3009 = g0\u3008\u03c8 \u2020 \u2193\u03c8\u2193(r)\u3009 (we consider here a spin-balanced system) and \u2206(r) = g0\u3008\u03c8\u2193(r)\u03c8\u2191(r)\u3009. The spectrum of the system can then be calculated using a standard self-consistent Bogoliubov transformation of the field operators and we note \u22060 and U0 the ground state values of \u2206 and U .\nWe can now calculate \u03c7R by considering the response of the fermionic superfluid to the following perturbation:\nHdrive[u, \u03c6] = \u222b d3r u(r, t)[\u03c8\u2020\u2191(r)\u03c8\u2191(r) + \u03c8 \u2020 \u2193(r)\u03c8\u2193(r)]\n+ [\u03c6(r, t)\u03c8\u2020\u2191(r)\u03c8 \u2020 \u2193(r) + h.c.], (19)\nwhere u and \u03c6 are driving fields coupling respectively to the density and the order parameter of the system.\nWe first consider the response of the fermionic superfluid by describing its dynamics using the Hamiltonian H0[U0,\u22060] + Hdrive, where we assume that the expressions of the Hartree potential and of the order parameter appearing in H are not affected by the perturbation. As a consequence, this first approach restricts the response of the system to the pair-breaking sector.\nFollowing [26], we write n = n0 +\u03b4n and \u2206 = |\u2206|ei\u03b8 ' \u22060 + \u03b4|\u2206| + i\u22060\u03b8, where we chose the phase of the order parameter such that \u22060 is a real number. Moreover, for any real physical quantity A we write A(r, t) = A\u0303ei(k.r\u2212\u03c9t) + A\u0303\u2217e\u2212i(k.r\u2212\u03c9t). In the framework of linear response theory, the response of the system in terms of order parameter and density is related to the drive fields u, \u03c6+ = <(\u03c6) and \u03c6\u2212 = =(\u03c6) by a 3-by-3 correlation matrix M(q, \u03c9)\n\u22060\u03b8\u0303/g0\u03b4|\u0303\u2206|/g0 \u03b4n\u0303  = M11 M12 M13M21 M22 M23 M31 M32 M33 \u03c6\u0303\u2212\u03c6\u0303+ 2u\u0303  (20) where the components Mij can be calculated explicitly as a function of the Bogoliubov amplitudes (uk, vk) [26][45]. In particular, we note that M33 corresponds to the density-density response of the superfluid. We have indeed \u03c7RMF = 2M33 and applying Eq.(14) to \u03c7 R MF yields the mean field Eq. (10) for \u03c7p. The perturbation of the order parameter and of the Hartree potential contradicts the assumption that U and \u2206 are not modified in the expression of H0. In the Random Phase Approximation, we solve this contradiction by considering a self-consistent response of the system to Hdrive. In other words, we now describes the system by HRPA = H0[U + \u03b4U,\u2206 + \u03b4\u2206] +Hdrive[u, \u03c6].\nWe note that, by construction, H0[U0 +\u03b4U,\u22060 +\u03b4\u2206]+ Hdrive[u, \u03c6] = H0[U0,\u22060] + Hdrive[u + \u03b4U, \u03c6 + \u03b4\u2206], from which we conclude that the response of the system can be described using the previous calculation, but considering now an effective self-consistent drive defined by\n\u03c6\u0303\u2212\u03c6\u0303+ 2u\u0303  eff = \u03c6\u0303\u2212\u03c6\u0303+ 2u\u0303 + \u22060\u03b8\u0303\u03b4|\u2206\u0303| g0\u03b4n\u0303  (21) Using the non self-consistent approach, we have\n\u22060\u03b8\u0303\u03b4|\u2206\u0303| g0\u03b4n\u0303  = g0M \u03c6\u0303\u2212\u03c6\u0303+ 2u\u0303  eff\n(22)\nhence, using the definition of the effective driving fields,\uf8eb\uf8ed\u22060\u03b8\u0303\u03b4|\u2206\u0303| g0\u03b4n\u0303  = g0MRPA \u03c6\u0303\u2212\u03c6\u0303+ 2u\u0303  (23)\n5 with\nMRPA = M\nI\u2212 g0M (24)\nThe compressibility of the system corresponds to \u03c7RRPA = 2 (MRPA)33. In the zero-range limit where g0 \u2192 0, the diagonal terms Mii with i = 1, 2 need to be renormalized to obtain finite values. Introducing M\u0303ii = Mii \u2212 1/g0, the compressibility can be written as a sum of a mean-field term and an interaction-induced term proportional to \u22062 [25]:\n\u03c7RRPA = 2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 M\u030311 M12 M13 M21 M\u030322 M23 M31 M32 M33 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223M\u030311 M12M21 M\u030322 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u03c7RMF + \u03c7 R int (25)\nwith\n\u03c7Rint = 2 \u2212M23M32M\u030311 \u2212M13M31M\u030322 + 2M12M23M31\nM\u030311M\u030322 \u2212M12M21 (26)\nWe note that, all matrix elements being calculated in the BCS superfluid, their imaginary part is non-zero only if the frequency \u03c9 is greater than 2\u2206 ; however, the zeros of the denominator of the beyond-mean-field term yield a non-zero imaginary part for frequencies below 2\u2206. In other terms, in addition to the contribution of the pair-breaking continuum, the RPA gives us both the dispersion relation of the collective modes and their contribution to the density-density response function. These collective modes were shown to turn into the usual Bogoliubov condensate modes in the BEC limit [25], and they become negligible in the BCS limit due to the exponential decrease of the gap.\nWe calculate numerically \u03c7R and \u03c7p using the approach laid out in [26], At large q, both the mean-field and RPA results behave as 1/q2 and we display in Fig. 2 the sub-leading contribution for a unitary Fermi gas. As discussed in the introduction, we observe that the meanfield prediction underestimates the value of \u03c71 while the RPA approach yields the asymptotic behavior given in Eq. (6) and is therefore compatible with a renormalization using three-body collisions.\nIII. HIGH-q BEHAVIOR OF \u03c71(q, q 2/(2mi))\nHere, we prove analytically that, as revealed numerically in previous section, \u03c71 follows the asymptotic behavior (6). In section III A, we first prove that the dominant O(q\u22122) term comes from \u03c7RMF, the mean-field contribution to the density-density response function and\nthat the mean-field contribution gives a O(q\u22123) term in (6), with a constant \u03baMF given by the first two terms in (7). Finally, in section III B, we prove that \u03c7Rint, the non mean-field contribution to the density-density response function gives a O(q\u22123) contribution to \u03c71(q, q\n2/(2mi)) and the third term in equation (7) for \u03ba."

Indeed, we can neglect k compared to q and \u2206 and \u00b5 compared to q2/mf . The integration gives a volume factor of the order \u039b3 and the contribution to M23 is of order \u2206\u039b 3/(q2/mf)\n2. Compared to the q\u22121 contribution, of the k > \u039b domain this is negligible. Indeed, we find a ratio of order \u039b3/q3 1.

In this regime, the bath is indeed made of two non-interacting Fermi seas of opposite spins and its elementary excitations are particle-hole pairs which are correctly captured within the BCS approximation, as well as its RPA extension. \u03c73 is then given by\n\u03c73(q, E) = 2\nn \u222b k<kF |k+q|>kF d3k (2\u03c0)3 1 (E + q2/2mf + k \u00b7 q/mf)3 ,\n(34) In particular, in the equal-mass case, an analytical calculation yields G1(\u2212\u221e) = 3/8 that coincides with the numerical results displayed in Fig. (1).\nIn the opposite limit, 1/(kFa) \u2192 +\u221e, the mean-field approximation strongly underestimates the correction to the effective mass. Indeed, in this regime the fermions become so tightly bound that Cooper pairs lose their internal degrees of freedom, and we can treat the system as a condensate of composite bosons [30, 31]. Pair breaking excitations are therefore suppressd and We can apply Eq.(2) to an ensemble of bosons, provided we replace \u03c73 by the response function \u03c7 b 3 of the condensate, calculated within the mean-field Bogoliubov approximation. The fermionic physical parameters n, mf , a and \u00b5 are replaced by their bosonic equivalents: the boson density nb = n/2, the boson mass mb = 2mf and the boson-boson scattering length (in the framework of BCS theory) abb = 2a which yields us the bosonic chemical potential \u00b5b =\n4\u03c0abb mb nb = gn/2.

Knowing that at unitarity the equation of state of the superfluid is the same as the one of an ideal Fermi gas up to a multiplying constant \u03be = 0.376 [19, 35\u201340], we obtain that the second term in the above expression (which we may call the three-body term) gives a relative correction about \u22124.7%, whereas the two-body term (the one involving F ) can be estimated to be around 1.1%.\nAlong the crossover, the correction due to the effective\nmass \u03b2 (2) m\u2217 reads\n\u03b2 (2) m\u2217 = \u2212\u03beG\u03b7(0) mf mr\nkFa \u2032\n9\u03c0 (45)\nwhich would give us a value of about \u22120.02%.\nAll these terms being second-order in g\u2032, their relative values at unitarity are fixed: the effective mass will always (in the RPA and as long as g\u2032 is small) have an effect on the frequency correction that is two orders of magnitude smaller than the two-body term of the ground-state energy and about 250 times smaller than the three-body term.\nInterestingly, [16] reported a \u223c 14 % upshift of the mean-field prediction with respect to the measured oscillation frequency at unitarity. This discrepancy is slightly beyond the 10% experimental error bar and the beyondmean-field correction calculated in the present paper lowers this difference to only \u223c 10 % that is now within the experimental uncertainty.\nIn this estimate of the beyond-meand field contribution to the frequency shift, we have neglected the drag between the two isotopes due to Andreev-Bashkin\u2019s effect [41] that was predicted first in nuclear physics and has recently been the focus of several theoterical studies in the context of ultracold gases [42\u201344]. The study of the interplay between these two effects is beyond the scope of this article and will be addressed in future work."

Compared to the term of\norder q\u22123, we find a ratio \u039b/q. Therefore it is negligible. In the same way, we find the integration in domain 2 is negligible.\n[1] L. Landau and S. Pekar, Zh.

M12 = \u2212i\u03a012/\u2126, M21 = i\u03a012/\u2126, M13 = (\u2212i/2)\u03a013/\u2126, M31 = (2 i)\u03a013/\u2126, M23 = (1/2)\u03a023/\u2126 and M32 = 2 \u03a023/\u2126. [46] Indeed, close to k\u0303\u2212 = 0 for instance, the k \u22124 contribu-\ntions of the two terms in (27) cancel. The next order term is proportionnal to k\u0303\u2212 \u00b7 q\u0302/k4\u2212 and vanishes also after angular integration. The lowest order term is then of order k\u22122\u2212 . After multiplication by the k 2 \u2212 of the jacobian of spherical coordinates, it tends to a constant. This shows that the integral 29 is convergent."
