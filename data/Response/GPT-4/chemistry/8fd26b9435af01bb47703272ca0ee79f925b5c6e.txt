Differential Binding Affinity of Toxic Cations to Cardiac Proteins: Investigate the differential binding affinities of toxic divalent and trivalent cations to cardiac proteins, such as EF-hand proteins and the myosin ATP-binding pocket. This research could further elucidate the specific structural and electrostatic requirements for cation-protein interactions and how these interactions influence cardiac function.

Impact of Amino Acid Substitution and Post-Translational Modifications on Cation Binding: Explore how amino acid substitutions and post-translational modifications within cardiac proteins influence the binding affinity and specificity for different cations, particularly toxic ones. Understanding these molecular changes could offer insights into the development of cardiovascular diseases and potential therapeutic targets.

Development of Cation-specific Inhibitors or Chelators: Based on the understanding of how various cations interact with cardiac proteins, design and test specific inhibitors or chelators that can preferentially bind toxic cations like Cd2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+, preventing their interaction with cardiac proteins. This could lead to novel treatments for cation-induced cardiotoxicity.

Comparative Analysis of Cation Effects on Myosin ATPase Activity Across Different Species: Perform a comparative analysis of the effect of various divalent cations on myosin ATPase activity across different species. This could uncover evolutionary adaptations in cation handling and toxicity mitigation in cardiac muscle, providing insights into the susceptibility or resistance to cation-induced cardiotoxic effects.

Role of Cation Competition in Cardiac Cell Physiology and Pathophysiology: Investigate the role of competition among essential and toxic cations for binding sites on cardiac proteins in cell physiology and pathophysiology. This research could reveal mechanisms by which toxic cations disrupt cardiac function and lead to disease, and identify potential biomarkers for early detection of cardiotoxicity.
