"As the field of nucleic acid-based Plasmon biosensors is continuously evolving, a regular reviewing of the latest breakthroughs and the most trending technologies is necessary. To highlight the recent progress of nucleic acid engineering for Plasmonic biosensor construction, this review will be chiefly focused on research outcomes published within the last five years. The applications of both simple aptameric structures and origami-shaped structures in SPR/LSPR, SERS, and MEF will be discussed."

"From this point of view, the authors discussed recent developments and future research directions for plasmonic sensing with DNA origami, such as fluorescence-based plasmon sensing, SERS sensing, and chiral sensing. It was concluded that the fabrication of DNA origami-based plasmonic sensors is a new technology platform for engineering molecular scale sensors and has reached a level that can be applied in the field."
