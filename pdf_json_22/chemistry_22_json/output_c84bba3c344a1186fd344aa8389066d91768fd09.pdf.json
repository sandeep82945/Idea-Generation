            "text": "Pyridines are privileged scaffolds and their incorporation into biologically-active molecules can dramatically improve their potency.1 Hence, synthetic tools that can selectively edit this moiety are highly desired to enable the streamlined synthesis of various pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.2\nIn the 1970s, Minisci and co-workers reported upon the thermal generation of alkyl radicals via decarboxylation of carboxylic acids using silver salts. These nucleophilic radicals were subsequently exploited to alkylate various heteroarenes, including pyridines, under strongly acidic and oxidative conditions.3 More than 50 years later, this strategy, coined as the Minisci reaction, still stands and has evolved into a key method for the modication of heteroarenes.4 However, between academic discovery and practical use in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry, there remain many roadblocks for the widespread implementation of the Minisci reaction. These challenges include (i) a functional-group tolerant electrophilic activation of the basic heteroarene, (ii)\nfor Molecular Sciences (HIMS), University Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

In recent years, the use of bulky, C-2 blocking groups has proven to be very effective to enable both regioselectivity towards the C-4 position and efficient electrophilic activation of the pyridine moiety (Fig. 1B).6\nWith respect to the generation of radicals, since the initial thermal decarboxylation methodology developed by Minisci, several milder strategies have been discovered. As a prime example, photocatalysis has emerged in the past decade as a powerful tool for the efficient formation of open-shell reactive intermediates.7 Among the different radical precursors available, the direct activation of ubiquitous C\u2013H bonds is perhaps one of the most desirable synthetic targets, as it bypasses the need for lengthy pre-functionalization steps. The homolytic cleavage of such inert C\u2013H bonds via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has recently been shown to be a very powerful approach to enable both early and late stage functionalization of hydroalkanes.8\nHowever, the coupling of the HAT-generated radical with activated pyridines is so far an underdeveloped strategy (Fig. 1C). Few examples are reported in the literature, usually requiring excess of hydrocarbons, inert conditions, transition metals and/or very extended reaction times, making such strategies less practical. Consequently, in order to make the transition from academic discovery to a scalable process, synthetic methodologies are urgently needed that use cheap\nChem.

Flow technology has been shown to uniquely pair with photochemistry, by effectively reducing the reaction times, by improving reaction selectivity due to excellent mass and photon transfer characteristics, and by enabling facile scale up.10 Moreover, using such a ow strategy would also enable us to combine both the photochemical C-4 functionalization of the pyridine and the subsequent removal of the C-2 blocking group, ultimately delivering an operationally simple process that should ensure the preparation of large quantities of C-4 alkylated pyridines using hydrocarbons as cheap and abundantly available coupling partners (Fig. 1D)."

            "text": "With this blueprint in mind, we commenced our investigations by testing a model system consisting of a commercially available C2-blocked pyridine 1,6h cyclohexane 2a, tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as the HAT photocatalyst11 and stoichiometric amounts of a terminal oxidant, i.e. (NH4)2S2O8.\n12528 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 12527\u201312532\nWe subjected the initial reaction mixture under air in a continuous-ow microreactor (ID \u00bc 0.8 mm, 3.3 mL) and exposed it to UV-A light irradiation (l \u00bc 365 nm, 60 W input power) (See ESI\u2020 for details). Under these conditions, we could observe the regioselective C-4 alkylation of 1 albeit with a low yield for 3a (Table 1, entry 1). In addition, precipitation of the photocatalyst and the oxidant in the reaction coil was observed, which would lead to clogging problems over time.12 We wondered if the highly-charged nature of TBADT could be an issue under these conditions, so we decided to switch to a simpler organic HAT mediator, such as benzophenone (BP1).13,14 Although similar low yields were obtained (Table 1, entry 2), a completely homogeneous solution was observed during the entire experiment.\nAer selecting BP1 as the HAT mediator, different oxidants and solvents were screened (see ESI\u2020 for details). Unexpectedly, when using oxygen as oxidant, the reaction was completely suppressed (Table 1, entry 3). Notably, a blank experiment revealed another interesting observation: without the addition of any external oxidant, we observed the formation of 3a in 13% yield using 20 mol% of BP1 (Table 1, entry 4). This nding, in combination with entry 3, prompted us to question if benzophenone could also act as a terminal oxidant. When repeating the reaction with a stoichiometric amount of BP1, the product 3a was obtained in 63% yield, demonstrating the ability of BP1 to not only engage in the C(sp3)\u2013H activation event, but also to serve as terminal oxidant (Table 1, entry 5). Next, we evaluated a diverse set of substituted benzophenones. Electron-rich (BP2,\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Finally, increasing the amount of BP1 to 1.5 equivalents allowed us to decrease the equivalents of the hydroalkane 2a to 2.5 equivalents, delivering the target compound 3a in 70% yield (Table 1, entry 9).\nThis result was obtained without any special precautions during the reaction preparation, including the use of wet reagents/solvents and working under air, making our reaction protocol particularly user-friendly. Interestingly, when repeating the reaction under conventional batch conditions, the yield for the benzophenone-mediated alkyl\u2013pyridyl coupling dropped to 27% (Table 1, entry 10), highlighting the importance of an efficient irradiation of the reaction mixture under microuidic conditions. No reactivity was observed when the reaction was performed without BP1 (Table 1, entry 11). Having found proper reaction conditions for the alkyl\u2013pyridyl bond-forming reaction, we next aimed to remove the C2-blocking group attached to the pyridine moiety. To do so, we merged the reaction stream exiting the photochemical ow reactor with a dichloromethane solution containing the organic base 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). In only 20 min overall residence time, we could perform both the photomediated alkylation and the removal of the blocking group without the need for intermediate isolation. In addition, this operationally simple protocol also allowed us to scale up the process without re-optimization of the reaction conditions, which oen plagues conventional batch scale up procedures. Simply by continuously pumping starting materials\nFig. 2 Substrate scope of the benzophenone-mediated alkylation of 0.5 mmol of 1, 1.25 mmol. of 2, 0.75 mmol. of BP1 in CH3CN (3 mL) and Isolated yield in brackets. * Indicates the position of theminor regioisome the first step.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ninto the reactor assembly, we could scale up the reaction to a gram-scale, with even slightly higher reaction yields (74% isolated yield for 4a, 91% purity, 210 mg hour\u22121).\nThe scope of pyridines that can be C-4 alkylated using our protocol is illustrated in Fig. 2. First, a diverse set of hydrocarbons bearing strong, non-activated C(sp3)\u2013H bonds (4a\u20134l) were subjected to the photochemical reaction conditions. Benzophenone was able to cleave the C(sp3)\u2013H bond in various cyclic alkane feedstocks, such as cyclopentane (4b), cycloheptane (4c), cyclooctane (4d), adamantane (4g), norbornane (4h), decalin (4i) and cyclododecane (4j) and the ensuing nucleophilic radical was subsequently coupled with the C2-blocked pyridine.\nAlso, linear alkanes, such as isopentane (4k) and n-pentane (4l), were selectively activated by benzophenone at their most hydridic C(sp3)\u2013H bonds. Various amides, including dimethylformamide (DMF, 4m) and dimethylacetamide (DMA, 4n), could be activated a-to-N C(sp3)\u2013H. Furthermore, 5 and 6- membered lactams (4o\u20134r), lactones (4s) and esters (4t) were compatible with our HAT-induced Minisci protocol. Notably, the sesquiterpene lactone natural product sclareolide (4u) could be regioselectively pyridinylated, demonstrating the potential of this protocol to act as a late-stage functionalization method. Finally, various C-3 substituted pyridines (4v\u20134x) were also compatible with the reaction conditions, giving rise to the corresponding C-4 alkylated compounds in good isolated yields. Unfortunately, alkanes bearing cyclic amines, cyclic ethers, aromatic rings or halogens gave rise to either low yields or complex reaction mixtures (see ESI\u2020 for details).\nNext, we sought to investigate the mechanism of this process and, in particular, to elucidate the role of benzophenone.

This fractional order suggests that the role of benzophenone is more complex, and implies that BP1 might be involved in different elementary steps through the entire mechanistic scenario. Similarly, to get further insights about the initial C(sp3)\u2013H bond cleavage of cyclohexane, we examined the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) (Fig. 3B). To do that, we compared the initial rates of both a standard reaction and a reaction using deuterated cyclohexane (2a-d12). A KIE of 1.7 was determined, which suggests that the C(sp3)\u2013H bond cleavage of the alkane might be involved in the rate-determining step.16 Further H/D scrambling experiments demonstrated the reversibility of the process under the described reaction conditions, as we observed partial deuteration of cyclohexane when repeating the reaction using D2O as cosolvent (Fig. 3C).\nTo further understand the experimentally-obtained mechanistic insights, we decided to simulate a plausible scenario that could explain this dual role of the benzophenone using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The obtained qualitative reaction prole with the corresponding energies is depicted in Fig. 4 (See ESI\u2020 for further computational details). The reaction kicks off with UVA-light photoexcitation of the ground state benzophenone BP1 to its triplet state BP1*. This highly electrophilic species, regarded as the 0.0 in the energy prole, is responsible for the homolytic cleavage of a C(sp3)\u2013H bond in the alkyl partner Cy1, through TS1 at 11.3 kcal mol\u22121. This low energetic barrier is in agreement with the absence of a primary KIE (Fig. 3B). The ensuing carbon-centered radical Cy2 resides\n12530 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 12527\u201312532\nin an endergonic position (\u22128.9 kcal mol\u22121) relative to BP1*. The reversibility of this step was observed experimentally (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that the reverse energetic barrier (20.2 kcal mol\u22121) can be overcome at room temperature under the described reaction conditions.\nSubsequently, species Cy2 can engage in a radical addition at the only electronically and sterically accessible position of Py1, through TS2b. Given that the reversibility of TS1 was demonstrated experimentally under these conditions, we can assume that the energetic barrier for TS2b (11.7 kcal mol\u22121) is also within reach. Finally, we simulated the re-aromatization of the reduced Py2b by a second molecule of BP1* via a second hydrogen atom transfer event in TS3b. The energetic barrier for this last step from Cy2 (11.0 kcal mol\u22121) is comparable to TS2b and to TS1, showcasing that all the elementary steps are feasible at room temperature. This demonstrates that BP1* can participate not only in the rst HAT reaction, but also in the terminal oxidation of Py2b, thus explaining the fractional kinetic order observed experimentally (Fig. 3A).\nCombining all experimental and computational evidence, we can portray a plausible reaction mechanism for the benzophenone-enabled photomediated C4-alkylation of pyridines (Fig. 5). A photoexcited ketone in the triplet state BP1* is responsible for the cleavage of the strong C(sp3)\u2013H bond via HAT, giving rise to a nucleophilic alkyl radical and concomitant formation of BP1-H. It should be noted that this protonated species can be re-oxidized to the original benzophenone under an oxygen atmosphere, leading to a catalytic pathway.14f However, this reoxidation pathway is particularly slow as shown by our experiments, making it less practical for scale up (see ESI\u2020). The generated alkyl radical is subsequently added to the activated pyridine, establishing the targeted alkyl\u2013pyridyl bond. Finally, the ensuing radical cation has to be rearomatized. Notably, this is the specic step that oen requires harsh, external oxidants in many Minisci reaction protocols. However,\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The second molecule of reduced BP1-H can be reoxidized in the same fashion by oxygen, closing what happens to be a rather slow, catalytic cycle.\nAdditionally, during our optimizations with BP1, we observed the formation of small quantities of the dimerized benzopinacol derivative. This evidence also corroborates with the proposed radical BP1-H and with the need for more than 1 eq. of BP1, thus suggesting a competition between the re-oxidation of BP1-H by O2 and its radical recombination (Fig. 5). Finally, the removal of the blocking group using a non-nucleophilic organic base gives rise to the desired C-4 alkylated pyridine."
