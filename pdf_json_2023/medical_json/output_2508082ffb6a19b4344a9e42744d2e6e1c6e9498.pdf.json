Yet, conventional measurements based on blood oxygenation are not specific to changes in blood volume. The purpose of this study was to extend to the heart a blood-pool MRI approach for assessing vasomodulation in the presence of blood gas changes and investigate if sex-related differences exist. Methods: Animals [five male and five female healthy Sprague Dawley rats (200\u2013 500 g)] were intubated, ventilated, and cycled through room air (normoxia) and hypercapnia (10% CO2) in 10-minute cycles after i.v. injection of blood-pool agent Ablavar (0.3 mmol/kg). Pre-contrast T1 maps and T1-weighted 3D CINE were acquired on a 3 Tesla preclinical MRI scanner, followed by repeated 3D CINE every 5 min until the end of the gas regime. Invasive laser Doppler flowmetry of myocardial perfusion was performed to corroborate MRI results. Results: Myocardialmicrovascular dilation tohypercapnia and constriction tonormoxia were readily visualized on T1 maps. Over 10 min of hypercapnia, female myocardial T1 reduced by 20% (vasodilation), while no significant change was observed in the male myocardium. After return to normoxia, myocardial T1 increased (vasoconstriction) in both sexes (18% in females and 16% in males). Laser Doppler perfusion measurements confirmed vasomodulatory responses observed on MRI. Conclusion: Blood-pool MRI is sensitive and specific to vasomodulation in the myocardial microcirculation. Sex-related differences exist in the healthy myocardium in response to mild hypercapnic stimuli.\nKEYWORDS\nvasomodulation, microvascular function, blood-pool imaging, heart, hypercapnia\nIntroduction\nThe microvasculature plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis: in addition to being the site of nutrient and gas exchange, it also maintains blood pressure, regulates perfusion in response to locally varying metabolic demands, and ensures new tissue grafts survive in vivo (1). In healthy microvessels, vasomodulation is intact, meaning vessels can dilate or constrict as required to increase or decrease perfusion. In many diseases, however, including cardiac and inflammatory conditions, vasomodulatory capacity is impaired, resulting in blunted vasodilation and/or vasoconstriction and ultimately reducing baseline perfusion (2). The current MRI approach for assessing microvascular vasomodulation is to apply a stressor (e.g., acetylcholine or hypercapnia) in tandem with an acquisition sequence sensitive to changes to\n01 frontiersin.org\ntissue perfusion (3). Typically, a T2*-weighted sequence is applied owing to its sensitivity to the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin (i.e., the BOLD effect), which is taken to be a surrogate index of perfusion. With this approach, cerebral vasoreactivity (4) and coronary vasodilation in the human heart (5) have both been successfully interrogated. Nonetheless, the T2*-weighted BOLD signal is non-specific. Changes in local oxygen consumption, blood oxygen saturation, flow velocity, and hematocrit can alter the BOLD effect in the absence of vasomodulation (6).\nTo specifically measure vasomodulation, one requires a metric that correlates with blood volume but is unaffected by concomitant confounders such as varying local oxygen metabolism. To address this need, Ganesh et al. proposed in 2017 a blood-pool MRI approach for measuring vasomodulation in the presence of changes in blood gases, first demonstrating in abdominal organs (7) and later extending it to ischemic disease (8) and low-perfusion tissue such as skeletal muscle (9). A blood-pool contrast agent is indispensable, as without it, earlier studies have shown low sensitivity and specificity to vasomodulation (10, 11). Using the blood-pool MRI method, one administers a bloodpool contrast agent (e.g., Ablavar) to achieve stable signal in blood vessels and then measure changes in the T1-weighted signal or T1 relaxation time as the microvasculature dilates or constricts in response to a stimulus. Because Ablavar binds reversibly to serum albumin, the bulk of the gadolinium-based contrast agent is retained in the vasculature, reducing the T1 relaxation time of water molecules inside and in close proximity to blood vessels. T1 changes are, therefore, a direct result of changes in contrast agent distribution space (i.e., changes in blood volume). Note that with this method, the goal is to obtain relative changes in blood volume in the minutes post-stimulus. The blood-pool MRI approach has seen much traction recently, with reports of its application to swine studies of the heart emerging later, using adenosine as a vasodilator and a different blood-pool contrast agent, Feraheme, to identify coronary perfusion deficit (12).\nIn this study, we exploit the specificity of the blood-pool approach of (7) to characterize vasomodulation in the healthy heart of male and female rats in response to hypercapnic stimuli. This characterization of the normal heart has not been reported in the literature, and potential sex-related differences are also unknown. Furthermore, to provide evidence that the MRI method is, indeed, tracking vasodilation or constriction, we perform laser Doppler flowmetry, an invasive gold-standard perfusion test."

            "text": "The use of a blood-pool contrast agent to assess microvascular blood volume is not a new concept; in fact, its distinct value was best demonstrated in pathologies where vessels were structurally compromised, as in cerebral neoplasms (21). However, the concept of blood-pool imaging to image vasomodulation in the presence of changing blood gases (e.g., hypercapnia or breathing maneuvers) is relatively new (7\u20139). Our study provides the first attempt to confirm this technique in the heart using a preclinical goldstandard assessment of perfusion, namely, laser Doppler flowmetry. We demonstrate that our blood-pool method can detect both vasodilation and vasoconstriction, with T1 changes on MRI corroborated by changes on laser Doppler perfusion. Furthermore, while the sensitivity of the blood-pool imaging technique was recently demonstrated in the diseased myocardium in response to adenosine (12), the present study shows that hypercapnia-induced vasoreactivity is also sensitively detected using this method, in the absence of disease. Gas challenge has the added benefit of enabling bi-directional blood volume changes, a key feature that is impossible with adenosine stress testing.\nAnother notable finding is the presence of a sex-dependent difference in the myocardial microvascular response to hypercapnia, specifically, mild hypercapnia (10% CO2). In healthy adult rats, the myocardium exhibited significant vasodilation in females but showed no changes in males. Vasodilation at this hypercapnic level is expected in the heart, because in contrast to other organs where 10% CO2 induces vasoconstriction, the heart possesses protective properties against hypercapnic acidosis (22). This response, known as \u201cvascular steal,\u201d is critical to facilitating blood flow redistribution and maintaining venous return. In fact, clinical studies have demonstrated increased coronary blood flow and vasodilation is seen at inspired CO2 levels as high as 12% (23), a phenomenon attributed to nitric oxide-mediated perivascular smooth muscle relaxation (24). On the other hand, blunted vasodilation in the male myocardium was unexpected and contradicts current clinical and pre-clinical studies that claim hypercapnia leads to an increase in myocardial perfusion in males. One possible explanation for this discrepancy could be that because the female heart, unlike the male heart, has a smaller cardiac output and a smaller microvascular blood reserve (25, 26), vasodilation is required to meet metabolic demands, whereas the male heart can better tolerate the added stress. Another explanation is that conventional methods for assessing vasomodulation (i.e., BOLD MRI) measures blood oxygenation and not blood volume. It is possible an increase in BOLD signal stems purely from elevated blood oxygenation, which is a known phenomenon during hypercapnia due to a reduction in heart rate and blood pressure (27, 28).\nLaser Doppler perfusion measurements confirmed the specificity of the blood-pool MRI method to vasomodulation. It is important to note that while perfusion is not equivalent to blood volume, changes in perfusion normally follow changes in blood volume in the absence of drastic shifts in flow velocity. For example, in response to 10% CO2, female myocardial T1 decreased 20% (vasodilation) and male myocardial T1 increased\nfrontiersin.org\nFIGURE 4 Laser Doppler perfusion measured continuously during normoxia-hypercapnia-normoxia gas stimuli in the myocardium in both sexes. Data for a representative male (A) and female (B) rat are shown. Measurements were collected at one reference location in the left ventricle for each animal at a frequency of 10 Hz. The transition from hypercapnia to normoxia in female rats was omitted due to noise and data corruption from extensive heart movement. Units are in relative blood perfusion units (BPU).\n5% (vasoconstriction). These two divergent responses were confirmed on laser Doppler, which revealed 33% increased perfusion in females and 12% decrease in perfusion in males. The MRI and laser Doppler measurements do not correspond one-to-one, because while MRI is sensitive to blood volume, laser Doppler is sensitive to blood volume and blood velocity. Therefore, changes in heart rate, as seen in a 11% elevation in males to 10% CO2, may affect laser Doppler measurements. Upon return to normoxia following hypercapnic challenge, the 19% increase in T1 in the male heart corresponded with a 24% decrease in perfusion. However, in the female heart, laser Doppler perfusion measurements were unreliable and could not be used to corroborate the significant vasoconstriction seen on MRI. Errors are incurred on laser Doppler flowmetry when there is non-negligible motion between the heart and optical probe. In the case of the female heart, transitioning from CO2 to normoxia introduced irregular cardiac motion that compromised laser Doppler readings and degraded them to the noise level. Despite this sensitivity to erratic motion, our unique surgical design generally enabled stable optical measurements on a beating heart, the first report of its kind.\nThere are several other noteworthy comments. First, vasomodulatory response to hypercapnia is relatively slow in the heart (over minutes) compared to that in the brain (over seconds), which necessitates the stimulus to be sustained long enough to be effective. Second, female rats had a considerably higher baseline T1 compared to males, which can be attributed to a higher collagen content in young, healthy rodent female hearts (29), along with higher extracellular volume, larger gaps in between cardiomyocytes, and significantly lower hematocrit levels when compared to their male counterparts (30). Third, the lack of vasodilation in response to mild hypercapnia in males may not persist throughout the lifespan: it is entirely possible the response may change to resemble that in females as male rats age. This highlights the importance of understanding what\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 06\ndefines normal vasomodulation in different age groups. Fourth, Ablavar is a reversible albumin-binding agent, which means it is not purely intravascular. When it transiently binds albumin and then unbinds, Ablavar will cross the vascular endothelium and occupy a space greater than the blood volume. While reversible albumin-binding precludes absolute quantification of blood volume, it enhances detection sensitivity by allowing a greater pool of water molecules to access the contrast agent. In the presence of vessel leakage due to endothelial dysfunction, a larger blood-pool nanoparticle may be a better agent for probing vasoreactivity, while an albumin-binding blood-pool agent can be retained for assessing endothelial leakage. Lastly, we want to emphasize that when analyzing trends in T1 or T1-weighted signal, it is important to focus on the changes, and not absolute T1 times, within minutes post-hypercapnic stimulus, as T1 will be subject to error from background drift and contrast elimination over tens of minutes. Previous studies confirmed that within a window of 40 min, T1 changes in the intravascular space from contrast elimination were not significant (7)."

Furthermore, our animals were imaged at one timepoint only due to the terminal nature of the perfusion study, which had not previously been attempted for cardiac perfusion in a rat model. Standard deviations were substantial due to the rapid motion of the rodent heart (>300 bpm). Future studies will include time-course imaging in a larger cohort of animals to assess potential changes in myocardial vasomodulation as a function of age. A disease\nfrontiersin.org\nmodel will also be included to assess the sensitivity of the technology in distinguishing microvascular dysfunction from normal vasomodulation. Translation to the clinic will not require intubation or invasive interventions, as gas challenge intervention is clinically approved and routinely studied (31).
