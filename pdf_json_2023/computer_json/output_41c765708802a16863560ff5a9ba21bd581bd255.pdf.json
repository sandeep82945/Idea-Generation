    "abstractText": "Learning from human driver's strategies for undertaking complex traffic scenarios has the potential to improve decision-making methods for designing ADAS systems, as well as for design selfdriving rules for automated vehicles. This paper proposes a human-like decision-making algorithm built up from human drivers experiential naturalistic driving. The approach of this work consists of exploring two main techniques. Firstly, the use of \u201cthink aloud protocol\u201d to build a dataset based on naturalistic driving, capturing driver\u2019s intentions. Afterwards, the technique of decision tree is used to generate an algorithm to categorize driving patterns as a function of circumstantial driving parameters. The study is focused on simple roundabouts in presence of other vehicles. The decision tree is translated into algorithmic rules, where the tree pathways are represented as 'if-then' rules. Finally, the accuracy of the driver behavior model has been assessed, yielding promising results.

INTRODUCTION Understanding driving and constructing the driver intention inference is crucial issue for building more responsible advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for improving driver safety [1], and will contribute to build more naturalistic self-drive systems within automated vehicles [2].\nTrying to understand driver behavior is an area of research known as driver behavior modelling [3-4], where several approaches are adopted to tackle such studies. For example, work [5-6] propose how to categorize driving into patterns of good or bad driving habits. Studies [7-8] focus on understanding naturalistic driving and how driving patterns could be translated to autonomous driving. Furthermore, and for safety reasons, several studies [9-11] are based on simulated environment, while others [12-13] are based on naturalistic driving, where data of the interaction drivervehicle-environment are collected during realistic driving, using appropriate experimental driving platforms with multiple non-intrusive sensors.\nModelling driving in complex traffic scenarios, such as intersections or roundabouts, is even more challenging. For\nexample, driving and crossing roundabouts are discussed in [14-16], and machine-learning techniques are proposed for generating driving rules when undertaking such traffic scenarios in [17-18]. From driving point of view, when a driver approaches a roundabout, the decision to brake or to engage onto the roundabout is based on external stimulus. From a human cognitive point of view, the perceived information (sight, hearing, etc.) is stored in the short and long-term memory. This information can be modelled as a decision tree, giving a representation of possible solutions to certain driving conditions.\nThe approach followed in this work combines the thinkaloud protocol and decision-trees for modelling driver behavior. The think aloud protocol technique can be used in naturalistic driving by involving drivers to verbalize and express their perceptions and actions as they drive vehicles in real-world conditions. The purpose of this technique is to gain insight into drivers behaviors, capturing their intentions at roundabouts and decision-making processes as responses to specific driving conditions. The think aloud protocol is used\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Afterwards, the dataset is used to train a decision-tree to categorize driving according to objective and circumstantial driving conditions. The decision tree may be considered as a repository of driving knowledge and experience, and can be used as an inference engine to make decisions.\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 presents some related work and the approach followed in the paper to build the driver behavior model at roundabouts. Section 3 explains the steps involved in the construction of the naturalistic driving dataset. Section 4 deals with process of decision-tree model construction and training as well as its assessment. Finally, conclusions and some futures work lines are drawn in section 5."

            "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, the present work proposes a combination of the think aloud protocol and decision-tree for modelling driver behavior at roundabouts. This section is dedicated to describe with more emphasis this two concepts and the involved fundamentals as well as to discuss some related works.\nThink aloud protocol is a research method that involves participants that verbally express their thoughts and reasoning as they are performing a task, such as using a software application, solving a problem, or driving a car. This technique was proposed by Newel and Simon [19] in 1972, and since then it has been widely used to analyze specific issues in many research areas like cognitive psychology [20], translation [21- 22] or user interface and user experience assessment in computer science [23-24], making possible to generate reasoning models based on human behavior. The purpose of think aloud protocol is to gain insight into a person's cognitive processes and identify patterns in its behavior.\nThe think aloud protocol technique has been applied to driving and driver behavior analysis in several studies. For instance, in [25], various methods, including think aloud protocol, were evaluated to assess a driver's attention while driving. In [26], the authors explored the application of TAP methodology to prove its validity for deducing driving rules. In [27], the aim was to understand how expert drivers (i.e., driving instructors) react and anticipate to driving startles, in order to provide similar anticipatory capacities to automated driving technologies. Efficient driving has also been studied in [28], where the think aloud protocol method was used to identify the mental models of eco-driving by conducting behavioral measures. Other studies related to measuring how drivers interact with semi-automated vehicles, in terms of trust, acceptance, and situation awareness, have been proposed in [29-30], as well as a study on the acceptance of ADAS in [31]. However, in the previously cited works, the think aloud protocol technique was limited to understanding certain driving concepts, and the obtained data were not processed using any computational techniques.\nIn the present work is proposed to use the think aloud protocol technique systematically to generate a naturalistic driving dataset in a roundabout. The TAP method is appropriate for reflecting the naturalistic driving experience. Subsequently, we use the obtained dataset to generate a driver behavior model driving at roundabouts, using the decision tree technique.\nOn the other side, decision-tree technique is widely used in classification problems [32-36]. Decision trees are representations of possible solutions to a decision based on certain conditions. Decision trees belong to supervised classification techniques, that can separate dataset into categories by applying specific conditions in the decisionmaking process. The classification models can be used to predict the class label for unknown records.\nThe advantages of decision trees are that they do not require large data collections for their construction, and their ability to use different attributes and decision rules at different stages of classification. Furthermore, decision tree are easy to interpret since decision rules can be illustrated visually, which helps to schematically represent knowledge models. Therefore, decision tree are suitable for modeling the behavior of a driver.\nIn fact, decision trees are also used in driving. For example, the studies [37-38] try to better understand drivers' responses to accident situations and model their behavior in naturalistic driving. Decision trees are also used in autonomous driving, proposing how autonomous cars can predict the intention of other vehicles and interact more safely with them in [39], or how create predictive model of lateral car control [40].\nIn summary, the approach of this work consists in using the think aloud protocol technique to build a dataset from experiential naturalistic driving to capture driver\u2019s intentions especially at roundabouts. To this end, the idea consists in recording audios and videos of a driver verbalizing his/her perceptions and actions, following a specified protocol. Afterwards, the recorded audios and videos are analyzed with the goal of extracting driving information. Later, the dataset is used to train a decision-tree algorithm to categorize driving patterns as a function of circumstantial driving parameters and on actual decision-making processes and driver\u2019s thoughts."

This section describes the whole process of dataset construction.\nFirst, the experimental setup for data collection as well as the driving scenario are described. Afterwards, is described how the \"think aloud protocol\" is applied, as well as how the driver is prepared to achieve an easy audios recording during experimental driving. Next, is explained the preprocessing of the recorded audios and videos as well as how aggregated data are obtained.

Experimental setup for data collection The experimental setup for raw data collection during naturalistic driving in these maneuvers is based on the use of two portable devices. The first device is a smartphone, installed on the car\u2019s dashboard, and used for recording videos of the routes from the frontal view of the vehicle. The smartphone runs an application for recording the vehicle GPS locations during the trip. The second device is a camera attached to glasses, and used for recording driver\u2019s speech (audios) as well videos from of the driver's point of view. Each experimental journey generates two video files and a csv file with timestamped vehicle GPS location.\nB. Roundabout traffic scenario Driving through a roundabout consists of three very distinct stages: namely, approaching the roundabout, maneuvering inside it, and finally the roundabout exit, where stage has its specific set of maneuvers. The \u201capproaching\u201d maneuver refers to a vehicle within 100 m before the roundabout entrance, and the \u201cexiting\u201d maneuver refers to a vehicle within 50 m after roundabout completion. Fig. 1 illustrates the three stages.\nOne of the crucial point when undertaking a roundabout is its entrance, especially when the roundabout is with several cars. To capture the driving scene from driver\u2019s visual camp, the semicircle of the roundabout, from its entrance, is divided into three zones: namely \u201cLeft\u201d, \u201cCentral\u201d, and \u201cRight\u201d zone, which are used to verbalize the presence or not of cars in each of them (see Fig. 2).\nThe presence of vehicles in these zones are marked in the dataset, and vehicles with no threat due to their trajectories are not included. Fig. 3 shows an example of this situation. The vehicle \u201cA\u201d is labelled in the dataset as conflictive in the left zone of the intersection first, since it determines the driver's upcoming decisions. However, vehicles \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d are not stored in the dataset since they do not compromise the driver\u2019s decisions.\nC. Events verbalization The think aloud protocol in the present study consists in the verbalization of some events taking place during the driving. Perceptions are input stimuli, while the actions are output events carried out by the driver. For example, \"Approaching a roundabout\" or \u201cLeft-section zone free\u201d are verbalized as perception events, while \"Slow down\" and \u201cTurning left\u201d are verbalized as output actions. Events verbalization is not an improvised speech, it follows instead a well-defined protocol, which is limited to the relevant aspects of driving, previously learned by the driver. The events are verbalized using reduced number of words (less than 4 words if possible), and are tagged with codes for text processing. Table I shows the examples commented above and their meaning. The complete verbalized events are summarized in the Appendix-Table I.\nD. Driver preparation and data collection Realistic and meaningful data, obtained from naturalistic driving, are only build with a reliable and effective verbalization. Thus, for avoiding wrong and undesirable verbalizations, the driver is prepared with a prior training to adhere to a specific protocol learning how to verbalize the driving events (perceptions and actions). The events verbalization have to be pronounced quickly, since there are circumstances where several events may take place simultaneously. In such situations, the events are verbalized sequentially. The training was achieved after few journeys, where the driver has been assisted by the research team helping him to pronounce aloud the events using proper tokens.\nData collection are performed by three male drivers with more than 25 years of driving experience, using a Volkswagen Golf with manual transmission in their habitual route from home to work. The route contain several roundabouts with four exits. In order to avoid prolonged stress while driving, journeys of 10\u201315 min driving were chosen.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Videos, audios and data preprocessing The final dataset is generated through performing several preprocessing phases. The first phase consists in processing the raw videos by isolating the video-frames related to roundabouts stretches, and by extracting the corresponding audios. Afterwards, the audios are then processed with Speech Recognition Python\u2019s library [41], used to identify verbalized events and then convert them into tokens saved in plain text files.\nIn a second phase, the obtained files are reorganized in structured files with one verbalized-event per line specifying additional attributes, such as a given code, identifying if the token corresponds to an input or output event, and the roundabout segment (approach, inside or exiting) where it took place.\nIn a third stage, aggregated and subjective information that are not verbalized are added by reviewing manually the recorded videos. These data deals with distances with the preceding vehicles, the presence or not of vehicles in the left, central and right zones from the roundabout entrance, and if the left or right lanes are occupied.\nIn the last stage, are added some objective data, such as vehicle speed, distance to the yield traffic sign, and the road speed limit, which are gathered from the smartphone App and the Google Maps API, which are properly synchronized with the audios.\nF. Final dataset organization The final dataset is embedded in a spreadsheet workbook, where each sheet contains data obtained from a single roundabout. Thus, the rows are used to record sequentially the verbalized events as the vehicle moves from the roundabouts approaching to its exit. The number of rows of each roundabout depends on the number of verbalized-events. The columns are used for recording the different attributes corresponding to specific verbalized events, as explained in the previous section. Spreadsheets are organized over 16 columns with the following attributes:\nA. Event: Coded tag of verbalized-event. B. Exit: Roundabout exit number. C. Dist-Y: Distance to yield sign (m). D. Speed-V RND: Actual vehicle speed (km/h) E. Speed-L: Road speed limit (km/h). F. Section: Vehicle location (Approach,\nInside & Exit). Logical distance to preceding vehicle\nG. Dist_PVL: Distance \u2248 60m. H. Dist_PVN: Distance \u2248 30m.\nLogical distance to yield traffic sign (roundabout entrance)\nI. Dist_YL: Distance \u2248 60m (Normal). J. Dist_YN: Distance \u2248 30; (Near). K. Dist_Yat: Roundabout entrance.\nThe presence of vehicles in the three zones inside the roundabout.\nL. Lz: Vehicle in the left side. M. Cz: Vehicle in the central side. N. Rz: Vehicle in the right side.\nThe presence of vehicles in the lanes inside the roundabout.\nO. LL: Left lane occupied. P. RL: Right lane occupied. Table II shows an example of 21 events recorded in a roundabout, where rows 5 and 6 show the braking and reducing gear due to the presence of vehicles in the left and central zones of the roundabouts.\nThe final dataset has a total of 30 roundabouts ready for high-level processing.

In this sense, the driver modelling can be seen as a classification problem, where the set of categories for classification purpose are the verbalized actions by the driver during his/her experiential\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Therefore, this stage is the key consideration the decision tree construction. The behavior model at roundabouts is built using version 9.9 of RapidMiner Studio [42], a software for data mining and analysis. The selection of this software obeys to several reasons: decision tree prototypes are built quickly, where data operations and processing are carried out without writing a classical computer program, and instead they are handled throw a friendly GUI.\nThe dataset consists of 246 events distributed over 30 roundabouts. It is divided in two disjoint subsets using stratified sampling. The first one, composed of 21 roundabouts with a total 172 events maneuvers, is used for the model creation and training. It represents the 70% of the data. The second set, composed of 9 roundabouts with 74 events (30%) is used for the model assessment. The choice of the roundabouts used for training and subsequent validation is\nmade trying to balance the total number of events in each sample.\nThe design process developed within RapidMiner is divided in two phases: (1) training and (2) testing, as shown in Fig. 4. In the training flow, the steps of model training are represented with boxes enclosing the different operation: (1) loading data from a file, (2) attributes selection, (3) selection of the actions representing the categories to be predicted, (4) the model training and decision tree building. The tree inference is an algorithm that follows a top-down and recursive \"divide and conquer\" strategy with the following steps: a) Calculate the gain ratio of each variable for the data set.\nSelect the attribute with the highest gain ratio for the root node, and create a branch for each possible value of the attribute. b) Separate the samples into subsets, one for each branch, according to the attributes values. c) Repeat recursively for each branch, using the assigned subset as the data collection. d) Stop if all specimens belong to the same class or there are no more attributes.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 6\ne) At each terminal node, assign the majority class of the leaf (or of the collection if there is no data).\nFig. 4 shows also the model-testing branch (steps 6 to 8), which is carried out after finishing the training phase. The training stage ends with the generation of a graphical representation of the decision tree and the algorithm describing the subsequent rules. The test phase ends with a table listing the samples with the predicted an action actually performed.\nA. Training stage The generated decision tree is shown in Appendix-Fig. 1, and it shows the most likely path, or the most repeated path, among the samples used during the training, which is clearly marked by the thickness of the edges between nodes. According to the generated model, it can be seen that the attributes that decide the action to be taken are the objective attributes (Speed-V RND) and (Dist-Y) specifying the vehicle speed rounded up, and the remaining meters to the yield traffic sign (or roundabout entrance) respectively. Meanwhile, subjective attributes regarding the presence of cars nearby, such as if the left zone is occupied or not, being close to the yield zone or not, have less weight when deciding about the actions to perform.\nFig. 5 shows more details of the first six levels of the decision tree. It can be observed that when the value of the Speed-V RND attribute is less or equal to 7.5, it will predict to STOP. However, when it is higher than 7.5 it continues going down through the left branch of the root, and the decision is then centered in the distance to the yield (DIST-Y attribute). When its value is lower or equals than 0.5 it finishes predicting RND-IN, the action that recommends to come inside the roundabout. If not, then the Speed-V RND is again evaluated, but in another range of values. For example, if it is greater than 33.5, then the speed limit of the road would be analyzed (Speed-L), and if it is lower or equals 35, the prediction would be to hold the throttle (T-HOLD).\nOne of the advantages of decision trees is that they can be transformed into algorithmic rules easily, where the pathways can also be represented as 'if-then' rules. The rules derived\nfrom the obtained decision tree are summarized in Fig. 6. This algorithm can be used to inform the design of advanced driverassistance systems (ADAS) and other safety technologies aimed at reducing the risk of accidents and improve driving experience.\nB. Assessment and testing stage Accuracy, which is a metric that generally describes how the model performs across all categories, is used to assess the goodness of the generated model. The accuracy is calculated as the ratio between the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It is therefore the number of correctly classified actions (\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc36!) with respect to all the events that have been classified( \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc36! + \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36!), where \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36! is the number of actions that have not been correctly classified (1).\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc36!\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc36! + \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36! (1)\nAssessing the accuracy is usually carried out using confusion matrix, which compares the true values against the predicted values, and shows the number of failures and successes for each case submitted to prediction. However, the present study is a case with a high number of events to be predicted, making the use of confusion matrix difficult to handle. For instance, for a roundabout with only a few elements, dozens of different association rules will be generated by combining different actions, which is not appropriate in the present study. Instead, tables showing the results of predictions obtained by the decision tree for each roundabout data were used in the assessment.\nTable III represents the results obtained from the decision tree for a roundabout approach of the test set. As it can be seen, the number of matches in this example are 6 out of 10, representing a 60%.\nHowever, even when predicted events do not match with real experiments, alternative and similar actions are proposed. For example, in the previous example, it can be seen action 1, where the model predicts \"gear down\" (GD) action when the real action is \"Brake\" (B-ON). The same observation happens with action 2. Although, these predictions do not match with\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Thus, actions corresponding to \u201cgear up\u201d, \u201cpressing throttle\u201d, and \u201creleasing brake\u201d, labeled as GU, TON, B-OFF respectively, are considered speed increase actions; and those corresponding to \u201cbraking\u201d, \u201creleasing throttle\u201d, \u201cholding throttle\u201d or \u201cdownshifting\u201d, labeled as BON, T-OFF, T-HOLD, GD respectively, are considered as speed reduction. The remaining of the actions are treated without any grouping.

At a first stage, the precision obtained between the action actually executed and the ones predicted by the model are about 45%. However, by grouping some actions in new categories, the accuracy of the model increased significantly reaching 74%.\nThe analysis of the obtained decision-tree shows that the actions are associated to objective attributes of the dataset, specifically, the distance of the vehicle to the roundabout entrance and the vehicle speed. Other attributes, such as the presence of vehicle within the roundabout are used at lower levels in the decision-tree.\nIn the present work, the verbalized tags list turned out to be the task with a room for improvement. The present study showed that several association can be done since several different action have the same goal. Thus, the first improvement is toward reducing the number of tags and reorganizing the different actions performing logical associations of several actions.\nAPPENDIX A\nVOLUME XX, 2017 7"
