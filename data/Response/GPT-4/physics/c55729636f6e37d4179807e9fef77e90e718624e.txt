Automated Optimization Techniques for Pre-training Task Fusion: Building on the approach of using a surrogate metric based on total energy to automatically fuse multiple pre-training tasks, future research could explore more sophisticated optimization techniques. This could include reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms to dynamically adjust the weighting of pre-training tasks based on their contribution to improving downstream task performance.

Extension to Dynamic Molecular Structures: While the current work focuses on static 3D conformers, an interesting direction would be extending the framework to handle dynamic molecular structures, such as those undergoing chemical reactions or conformational changes. This would involve developing pre-training tasks that can capture temporal changes in bond lengths, angles, and dihedral angles to predict properties of molecules in dynamic states.

Integration with Quantum Chemistry Methods: Integrating the 3D PGT framework with ab initio quantum chemistry methods could potentially improve the prediction of electronic properties that are sensitive to precise geometric configurations. By combining graph-based approaches with quantum mechanical calculations, one could develop hybrid models that leverage the strengths of both methods for highly accurate molecular property predictions.

Expanding the Framework to Material Science Applications: The current methodology is focused on molecular property prediction. However, the framework could be adapted and expanded to predict properties of complex materials, such as crystals or polymers, where 3D structure plays a critical role in determining material properties. This would involve adapting the pre-training tasks to account for the periodic boundaries and more complex interactions present in materials.

Improving Efficiency and Scalability: While the proposed 3D PGT framework improves efficiency by eliminating the need for explicit 3D structure calculation in the fine-tuning/prediction stage, further research could focus on making the pre-training process itself more efficient and scalable. This could involve developing more computationally efficient methods for generating and using 3D conformers, or exploring ways to leverage unsupervised learning techniques to utilize large, unlabeled datasets more effectively.
