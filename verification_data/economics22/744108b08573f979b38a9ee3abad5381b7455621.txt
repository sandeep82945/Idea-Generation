Based on the provided text, the portions mentioning future research directions are as follows:

1. "Although this study provides insight into how the pandemic has affected historically marginalized race/ethnic groups of students, further evidence is needed to determine the extent to which learning losses or gains have occurred within other vulnerable groups of students, such as English learners and students with disabilities, over the pandemic period."

2. "More causal intervention studies that compare in-person to face-to-face instruction along with detailed contextual information would permit a deeper understanding of how and why the in-person learning mode provides enhanced learning opportunities for students to make continuous growth in reading during the pandemic, particularly for lower-achieving students, and what online instructional approaches and resources need to be considered in remote schooling to meet the diverse learning needs of students."
