1. **Investigate the use of more sophisticated aggregation methods:** The paper uses a simple mean to aggregate the probabilities from neighboring devices. More sophisticated methods, such as weighted averaging or majority voting, could potentially further improve accuracy.


2. **Explore the use of different communication protocols:** The paper assumes perfect communication between devices. In practice, communication may be unreliable or intermittent. Investigating the impact of different communication protocols on the accuracy of activity recognition is an important next step.


3. **Develop methods for handling missing data:** The paper's dataset contains some missing data. Developing methods for handling missing data is important for making the approach more robust in real-world settings.


4. **Investigate the use of the approach for recognizing more complex activities:** The paper focuses on recognizing a small set of simple activities. Investigating the use of the approach for recognizing more complex activities, such as cooking or playing a sport, is a promising direction for future research.


5. **Explore the use of the approach in different domains:** The paper focuses on activity recognition in a work and study setting. Investigating the use of the approach in other domains, such as healthcare or transportation, is another promising direction for future research.
