    "abstractText": "Early diagnosis of oral cancer is critical to improve the survival rate of patients. Raman spectroscopy, a non-invasive spectroscopic technique, has shown potential in identifying early-stage oral cancer biomarkers in the oral cavity environment. However, inherently weak signals necessitate highly sensitive detectors, which restricts widespread usage due to high setup costs. In this research, the fabrication and assembly of a customised Raman system that can adapt three different configurations for the in vivo and ex vivo analysis is reported. This novel design will help in reducing the cost required to have multiple Raman instruments specific for a given application. First, we demonstrated the capability of a customized microscope for acquiring Raman signals from a single cell with high signal-to-noise ratio. Generally, when working with liquid samples with low concentration of analytes (such as saliva) under a microscope, excitation light interacts with a small sample volume, which may not be representative of whole sample. To address this issue, we have designed a novel long-path transmission set-up, which was found to be sensitive towards low concentration of analytes in aqueous solution. We further demonstrated that the same Raman system can be incorporated with the multimodal fibre optical probe to collect in vivo data from oral tissues. In summary, this flexible, portable, multi-configuration Raman system has the potential to provide a cost-effective solution for complete screening of precancer oral lesions.",

Raman spectroscopy, a\nnon-invasive spectroscopic technique, has shown potential in identifying early-stage oral cancer bio-\nmarkers in the oral cavity environment. However, inherently weak signals necessitate highly sensitive\ndetectors, which restricts widespread usage due to high setup costs. In this research, the fabrication and\nassembly of a customised Raman system that can adapt three different configurations for the in vivo and\nex vivo analysis is reported. This novel design will help in reducing the cost required to have multiple\nRaman instruments specific for a given application. First, we demonstrated the capability of a customized\nmicroscope for acquiring Raman signals from a single cell with high signal-to-noise ratio. Generally, when\nworking with liquid samples with low concentration of analytes (such as saliva) under a microscope, exci-\ntation light interacts with a small sample volume, which may not be representative of whole sample. To\naddress this issue, we have designed a novel long-path transmission set-up, which was found to be sensi-\ntive towards low concentration of analytes in aqueous solution. We further demonstrated that the same\nRaman system can be incorporated with the multimodal fibre optical probe to collect in vivo data from\noral tissues. In summary, this flexible, portable, multi-configuration Raman system has the potential to\nprovide a cost-effective solution for complete screening of precancer oral lesions."

            "text": "Oral cancer refers to pathologies affecting the tongue, floor of mouth, upper and lower alveolus, palate, and buccal mucosa.1,2 It is described as 16th most common cancer worldwide, often detected in advanced stage, resulting in an overall survival rate of 40\u201360%.3 The survival rate could be significantly improved to <80% 4\u20136 if detected in precancerous stage. Primary care delays in recognizing suspicious symptoms remains an ongoing problem in cancer diagnosis.7 To address this, previously various physician-friendly point-of-care optical techniques that can provide easy, inexpensive, rapid and onsite monitoring such as fluorescence, diffuse reflectance and vibrational spectroscopy have been explored.8 Among them, Raman spectroscopy has the potential to generate data with detailed molecular information. In addition, Raman spectroscopy is preferred for analysing bio-fluids and in vivo measurements as water is a weak Raman scatter due to the polar nature of the OH bond, providing minimum interference in the fingerprint region (200\u20131800 cm\u22121).9,10 Raman spectroscopy is generally a non-invasive approach used to gain chemical and structural information as well as to study molecular interactions.11\u201313 It can be used for quantitative and qualitative analysis of a wide range of samples and materials. It has proven particularly useful in industrial and medical applications having resolved limitations of other spectroscopic techniques.14 In biomedical optics and clinical applications, Raman spectroscopy in combination with multivariate analysis has proven its potential. The ability of detecting biochemical changes in tissues and cells can lead to a real time clinical diagnostic capabilities. Several studies have highlighted the importance of Raman spectroscopy for tissue differentiation in ex vivo and in vivo analysis.15\u201317 Typically, a modern Raman spectrometer consist of an excitation source \u2013 usually a monochromatic laser, optical components to both transmit laser energy to specimen and collect back scattered signal, a notch filter to reject Rayleigh scattered light, a grating spectrometer and a high-end charged coupled device (CCD) camera to capture a Raman spectrum. aTyndall National Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.

Such instruments are commercially available at high cost and are bulky, non-portable, sample volume limited and are not considered suitable for point-of-care application. Additionally, Raman spectrometer coupled with the microscope are generally used as benchtop systems for ex vivo analysis owing to its bulkiness and limited flexibility to be used with the fibre optical probe and are therefore not suitable for clinical environment. To facilitate early detection at the primary-care level, as well as in research studies, we envision the use of a highly configurable spectrometry system suitable for seamless integration with the clinical procedure. Here, we describe an affordable, Raman-based instrument capable of both in vivo and ex vivo analysis employing single platform which can be easily wheeled to provide on-site testing and can be operated by a qualified clinician/lab technician with training and practice. Spectroscopic cell and supernatant analysis would be done to guide if biopsy sampling is necessary. After a positive test result of saliva or cell pellet analysis, in vivo measurements can be conducted just before tissue biopsy to guide for a suitable location of biopsy sampling and thereby provide improved sensitivity/specificity of diagnosis. Initially, the data analysis will be done by the experts, to later be automated after collecting sufficient data for machine learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the design of multi-configurational Raman system addressing the limitations of the commercial clinical instruments. The novel Raman system described here is compact, cost effective, portable and easy to assemble and align. It can easily fit into a console for transportation, thereby potentially facilitating point-of-care diagnostics. The design of our instrument is modular, consisting of the following: Mode (A) Raman microscope \u2013 for ex vivo saliva cell pellet analysis. Mode (B) Raman transmission stage \u2013 for saliva supernatant analysis using photonic crystal fibre (PCF). Mode (C) Raman optical fibre probe \u2013 for in vivo tissue analysis. This makes it suitable for both in vivo and ex vivo analysis and can be used in upright and transmission modes for liquid samples. The detailed optical design is given in the Methods section, enabling the easy adaptation by researchers in the field. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of our system in the context of oral cancer screening. The described system is only a prototype. Final system can employ centrifugation microfluidics19 to separate cell pellet from supernatant, which will minimize human interventions. A typical work-flow of the procedure is shown in Fig. 1."

The illumination was achieved by a 785 nm narrow line width laser with high suppression of side bands (>60 dB suppression at 0.3 nm from the laser peak, Cobolt 08-01 Series, Cobolt, Sweden). The Raman spectrometer was equipped with a diffraction grating with 1200 groves per mm grating density (LS-785, Teledyne Princeton Instruments, USA), a 1340 \u00d7 400 pixels back illuminated CCD camera (Blaze: 400HR, Teledyne Princeton Instruments, USA).

This Raman system can also utilise the customised transmission stage for the analysis of liquid specimens in transmission mode (Fig. 2, Mode B) and an optical fibre probe for the in vivo analysis (Fig. 2, Mode C).

The following section describes each of these configurations in detail with the novel optical design.\n2.2 Mode (A) Raman microscope for ex vivo cell pellet analysis\nFig. 2, Mode A represents the customised Raman microscope which consists of a laser and a visible light source (for sample visualization) connected through optical fibres. Fibre coupled illumination allowed modification of the spot size on the sample plane. Further, this fibre guided light delivery makes the switching of different excitation wavelengths easy. Another important feature of this system is a flexible stage design, which can accommodate different specimen in different dimensions from mm to tens of cm. The specimen was illuminated through an objective lens and Raman scattered photons were collected via the same objective lens in backscattering mode and in turn, directed to the spectrometer via 7\u00d7 roundto-linear low OH fibre bundle with 200 \u03bcm core (Thorlabs BFL200LS02). Simultaneously, a portion light from sample was patched to a CCD detector. This configuration was used for ex vivo analysis of solid and liquid specimens in the reflective mode.\nWhite light imaging optical path. A broadband visible light source (Thorlabs M365LP1, 365 nm, 1350 mW mounted LED) was used to illuminate the specimen for conventional optical microscopy. The light beam entered the microscope via lens L1 (Thorlabs LA1951A, f = 25 mm) and redirected to the objective lens using a beam splitter BS (Thorlabs, BSW26R, 50 : 50, 350\u20131100 nm), dichroic mirror DM1 (Semrock, FF757-Di01) and dichroic mirror DM2 (Semrock LPD02-785RU). The L1 was arranged to provide uniform Kohler illumination of white light on the sample plane. The white light scattered from the sample was reflected by DM2 to DM1 which redirected it to a colour camera through BS and a field lens L2 (Thorlabs LB1437-A, f = 150 mm). A high-resolution coloured CMOS camera (Thorlabs DCC1645C) was used to visualize the sample under white light illumination. The field of view (FOV) was controlled using a microscope objective lens L4 (116 \u00d7 92 \u00b5m for 50\u00d7, 290 \u00d7 230 \u00b5m for 20\u00d7 and 1160 \u00d7 920 \u00b5m for 5\u00d7). The images were displayed on computer screen using the Thorcam software.\nRaman optical path. Monochromatic light (785 nm laser) passed through the collimation lens L3 (Thorlabs A397TM-B, f = 11 mm, NA (numerical aperture) = 0.3) and laser cleaning bandpass filter BP (Semrock LD01-785/10-25). Afterwards, the collimated excitation beam passed through the DM1 and was reflected by DM2, which was focused on the sample plane by microscope objective. The spot size of the focused excitation beam was 60 \u00b5m with 20\u00d7 objective lens (Fig. 4). The Raman scattered photons from the sample passed through the objective lens and the excitation light is filtered out using a dichroic mirror (DM2) and long pass filter LPF (Semrock LP02785RU-25). The filtered Raman light (free of excitation light) was focused on to a low OH circular to linear fibre bundle\n(Thorlabs BFL200LS02) using a lens L4 (Thorlabs F810SMA-850, f = 36.2 mm). The linear side of fibre was attached to the entrance linear slit of the Raman spectrometer. The Raman spectrometer subunit contained a filter chamber with a long pass filter (Semrock LP02-785RU-25), a high throughput spectrometer (Teledyne Princeton Instruments Acton LS785, f/2), and a highly sensitive deep depleted CCD camera (Blaze: 400HR, Teledyne Princeton Instruments, USA). The CCD pixels were binned vertically to combine light from linear slit. The light from the CCD is acquired using the LightField software (Teledyne Princeton Instruments, USA)."

            "text": "Fig. 2, Mode B and Fig. 3B illustrate a horizontal stage for liquid specimen analysis in transmission mode using PCF. PCF are optical fibers composed of periodic array of air-holes surrounding a solid or hollow-core. In this study, the fiber used is the simplest PCF that is composed of silica core (SC-PCF) at the intersection of three large air holes. Light is guided in the triangular core shape by the total internal reflection mechanism based on the large refractive index difference between the silica and air, and by the reduction of the thickness of the three silica struts enhancing light confinement in the core.20,21 To integrate the inherently weak Raman signal from a liquid specimen (saliva supernatant) over a large volume, the SC-PCF with 3.5 \u00b5m core diameter, >70 \u00b5m airchannel diameter, and NA = 0.5 was filled with aqueous liquid. The external diameter (200 \u00b5m) of this SC-PCF is slightly larger than a standard fiber for allowing easier handling. In this SC-PCF, Raman signals are generated by the evanescent wave extended into the holes while excitation light (785 nm) propagates through the solid core.20,22,23 The sample holder was used in this way to prolong light\u2013sample interaction length, thereby improving detection sensitivity.24 Another advantage with a longer path length than in a microscope was that the larger volume sampled can be more representative, especially for low concentration analytes. A further advantage was that still a very small volume of analyte was required (about 20\u2013100 nl). A PCF filled with sample solution can be directly placed under the Raman microscope to collect the signal in conventional reflective mode. However, to ease the alignment of input laser beam in to the PCF, we designed a horizontal optical stage enabling the collection of signals in transmission mode. A 785 nm laser beam entered the PCF through an FC/PC connector (ferrule connector/physical contact connector). Raman signal emitted from the other end was collimated by an aspheric lens L1 (Thorlabs S-LAH64, f = 20 mm, NA = 0.54, ARC: 650\u20131050 nm). This lens was selected to match the NA of the PCF enhancing the collection efficiency. The collimated Raman signal, after passing through a long pass filter (LPF) (Semrock LP02-785RU-25), was collected by another lens L2 (Thorlabs N-BK7, f = 50 mm, NA = 0.23, ARC: 650\u20131050 nm) and focused on a low OH circular to linear fibre bundle (Thorlabs BFL200LS02).

The Fig. 3(A) shows the cross section of a typical suspended core PCF used in this study.\n2.4 Mode (C) Raman optical fibre probe for in vivo tissue analysis\nFiber optics-based Raman spectroscopic system has a tremendous potential for real time in vivo tissue analysis in endoscopy or surgical guidance. However, for such applications small and flexible fiber optics probes are mandatory. This requirement has limited the clinical implementation of fiber optics based Raman technology for many years.25 Recent advancement in fiber optics technology and miniaturization of the optical components have improved the in vivo implementation.26\u201328 Fig. 2, Mode C shows a multi-spectroscopy fibre-optic probe (EMVision, Loxahatchee, FL, USA) used for the in vivo tissue analysis. This customised in vivo probe can be used to acquire spectra from multimodal spectroscopic techniques including\nRaman, fluorescence (FS) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The probe consisted of 9 \u00d7 300 \u03bcm core diameter, 0.22 NA low OH silica fibres arranged in a concentric ring around a 300 \u00b5m core diameter, 0.22 NA low OH silica fibre used for Raman excitation. Seven out of nine fibres from the circular geometry collected the Raman signal passed through a donut shaped notch filter (NF), which rejected the laser line while transmitting the Raman signals from the probed tissue. The remaining two fibres can be used for DRS and FS. There was a short pass emission filter (SPF) in front of the central Raman illumination fibre to clean input laser line. A two-component customised lens L1 is placed at the probe tip to overlap the focus of excitations light and the area of collection of the Raman light from the tissue. Seven Raman collection fibres were aligned into a single line on the other end of the probe to deliver collected signals to the spectrometer via 50 \u03bcm slit. The accumulated signals from the seven fibres provide an optimum signal-to-noise ratio, needed for biological samples."

Biological fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and tears are rich in biomarkers that could be indicative of the health status of the sampled\nindividual.30\u201332 This provides a minimal invasive route for cancer screening and to classify cancer patients based on biomarkers identified.33,34 The proposed Raman microscope can be used for the ex vivo analysis of any excised tissue or for liquid biopsies.\nFig. 5(A) illustrates Raman spectra from saliva specimen in both dried and liquid phase as well as from the mono layer of red blood cell and cheek cells as shown in Fig. 5B and C respectively. As can be seen, the Raman spectrum of saliva sample is featureless when wet but exhibits distinct peaks when dried. Several peaks characteristic of saliva are discernible.35 For instance, peaks around 1049\u20131053 cm\u22121 are assignable to C\u2013C stretching vibration of lipids. Furthermore, a wellknown Raman bands characteristic of amide-I vibration of salivary proteins at around 1639\u20131670 cm\u22121 are also discernible. Also, unique to the saliva specimen are two additional peaks at 877 cm\u22121 and 938 cm\u22121 corresponding to a mixture of \u2013C\u2013 O\u2013C\u2013 and \u2013C\u2013C\u2013, ring and stretching modes.36 The Raman spectrum of red blood cell, on the other hand, was dominated by the haemoglobin signatures clearly differentiating it from cheek cell and saliva. Specifically, prominent peaks at around 1618 cm\u22121 and 1562 cm\u22121 can be assigned to the CavCb vibration of the vinyl groups, and C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b2 stretching modes in heme, respectively. Whereas peaks at 752 and 1395 are associated with pyrrole ring in heme. All the important differentiating Raman bands are presented in Table 1. Previously, Raman has been used to detect structural and biochemical changes in salivary analytes (e.g. proteins, amino acids, nucleic acids) accompanied with diseased transformation.17 However due to generally weak signals and the strong background interference, most of the studies have been done on dried saliva samples to concentrate the analytes or utilized plasmon\nFig. 5 (A) Pre-processed Raman spectra from saliva specimen in liquid and dry form.

The use of low NA longer focal depth objective lens (e.g. 5\u00d7 or 10\u00d7) have poor collection efficiency and a focal length of tens of micron implies interaction of laser light with the sample is limited and thus requires long integration time, typically tens of seconds. These are not suitable for fast detection. Recently, fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (FERS) where hollow core fibers and PCF have been used to confine the excitation light along the fiber (mm) length, thereby enabling the strong and efficient process of light\u2013matter interactions (>50 times of conventional microscopic measurements) leading to enhanced Raman signals.38,39 The sample volume probed at the focus of an objective will always be much smaller than the total volume probed over the length of these fibers.38 To implement FERS, we developed the novel transmission mode stage (B) in which signal gets integrated over an extended interaction length with the light.23,38,39"

In such measurements one must consider light attenuation yielding a reduction of transmission signal due to scattering and absorption. It is thus important to characterize the optimum PCF length.

Different lengths of PCF ranging from 9 cm to 13 cm were tested. The results are shown in Fig. 6A, highlighting the maximum Raman signal for 9 cm and 10 cm PCF lengths. Subsequent increase in the length >10 cm of the PCF lead to gradual decrease in Raman photons due to absorption/scattering loss. The curves in the Fig. 6B represent Raman signals for different modes of our new Raman system using oil as an\nTable 1 Spectral assignment of the dominated Raman signatures observed in experimental data36,40\nWavenumber (cm\u22121) Spectral assignments\n752 \u03bd(pyrrole breathing) stretch in heme; symmetric ring breathing in tryptophan 877 C\u2013O\u2013C ring (polysaccharides);C\u2013C stretching (hydroxyproline) 938 C\u2013O\u2013C stretching (polysaccharides); C\u2013C stretch \u03b1-helix proteins 960 PO4\n3\u2212 symmetric stretch (hydroxyapatite) 1003 Symmetric ring breathing mode of phenylalanine 1030 C\u2013H in plane bending of phenylalanine 1080\u20131090 C\u2013C stretch acyl chains (gauche) lipids; PO2\n\u2212 stretching (DNA); \u03bd(C\u03b2C1) asymmetric stretch (hemoglobin) 1130 C\u2013C stretch acyl chains (trans) lipids; C\u2013O stretch polysaccharides; \u03bd(pyrrole half-ring) asymmetric stretch (hemoglobin) 1204\u20131209 C\u2013C6H5 stretch phenylalanine and tryptophan 1220\u20131320 Amide III-combination of NH in-plane bending and CN stretching 1302 CH2 deformation (lipids) 1340 Nucleic acid (adenine, guanine); CH deformation polysaccharides 1395 \u03bd(pyrrole quarter-ring) stretch (hemoglobin) 1440 CH2 bending mainly in lipids 1450 CH2 bending mainly in proteins 1562 \u03bd(C\u03b2C\u03b2) stretch (hemoglobin) 1618 \u03bd(CavCb) of vinyl groups (hemoglobin) 1656 CvC stretch mainly in lipids 1630\u20131690 Amide I: mainly CvO stretch in proteins 1740 CvO in lipids"

This improvement of signals in PCF compared to 2D substrates would be critical in detecting low concentration oral cancer markers in saliva.\nThe spectra in Fig. 7 represents Raman signals of 50 \u03bcM solution of Rhodamine B (Rhd B) in water filled in the PCF and observed in transmission mode vs. on a CaF2 substrate and observed under the microscope in reflection mode. Rhd B peaks that were difficult to see on a 2D CaF2 substrate under the microscope were significantly stronger when analysed through PCF due to increased interaction between the excitation laser and analyte over the length of 9 cm. The observed Rhd B peaks were in line with the previously published literature.43\n3.3 Mode (C) Raman optical fibre probe for in vivo tissue analysis\nOver the time, Raman spectra of various tissue has been observed. Most recognized Raman scatterers are blood, lipid, collagen, tyrosine elastin, myoglobin, carotenoids and nucleic acids etc.17,44,45 Fig. 8 represents spectra from different tissue types in the oral cavity collected from a healthy participant with the customised fibre optic probe. The probe was gently\nplaced on the area of interest to collect the Raman data from various tissues. 30 mW laser power was used to collect signal for a time of 4 s, to keep the energy per unit area within the permissible limit of the tissue.\nThe difference between different tissue types was clearly visible, especially signal from mandible bone was quite prominent at 960 cm\u22121 in the data collected from human gingiva while the lip Raman spectrum was dominated by lipid signals at 1080, 1302, 1440 and 1740 cm\u22121.46,47 Other subtle differences in these three different tissue types can be seen in terms of peak height and width at 1003 and 1660 cm\u22121 respectively. The molecular vibrational modes associated with these changes are tabulated in Table 1."

            "text": "Design development and assembly of a versatile customised Raman system is reported in this study. This system can work in three different modes. The first mode was Raman microscope combined with conventional optical microscopy. This microscope has a flexible stage design for sample of different dimensions. We also demonstrated the benefit of the custom built liquid sample transmission stage over microscope in collecting signals from low concentration analytes. This PCF based transmission set-up enabled stronger Raman signals in a relatively small volume. Lastly, the flexible optical fibre based probe is suitable to acquire multiple (Raman, diffuse reflectance and fluorescence) spectroscopic techniques data from the same tissue location in vivo. In summary, this flexible Raman system is of great potential for the early diagnosis of oral cancer via initial screening using participants saliva followed by Raman spectral signatures guided biopsy of the lesions. The flexible and modular design can be of interest to Raman spectroscopy community and potentially in future primary care."
