            "text": "In the past century, artificial light was produced almost exclusively by plasma sources, such as arc lamps, and although light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have, in recent years, made inroads into the indoor and outdoor lighting markets, plasma lamps remain the light source of choice for many applications. In this foundation series article, we discuss the importance of plasma as a source of visible, ultraviolet, and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation but also as a medium having a wavelength- and electron density-dependent refractive index ideally suited for manipulating electromagnetic (EM) radiation at microwave, mm-wave, and THz frequencies.\nThe discussion to follow is restricted to specific plasmabased devices that generate or control EM radiation. For the sake of brevity, optical plasma diagnostics and optical sources generated by lasers (i.e., \u2018laser-induced plasmas\u2019) will not be treated here. Also, atomic and molecular state notation, as well as the quantum mechanical selection rules governing dipoleallowed transitions between atomic or molecular eigenstates, are not described here. Because the spectral profile emitted by atoms and molecules within a plasma often provides the tool by which the existence of a specific radiating species is identified, the reader is encouraged to consult one of many widelyavailable texts concerning the optical spectroscopy of atoms and molecules. The reader will also note that, throughout this article, we describe UV and VUV radiation as \u2018light\u2019 although the latter is traditionally reserved for visible radiation.\nIn the sections to follow, the physics of several lightemitting plasmas will be discussed, including those at the heart of \u2018traditional\u2019 light sources (such as fluorescent and thermal arc lamps), microcavity plasmas, and lasers. Because these visible, UV, and VUV sources differ enormously in electron number density, operating pressure, specific power deposition, gas phase chemistry, background gas temperature, and wall interactions, emphasis will be placed on the fundamental processes by which plasma photonic devices and systems function."

            "text": "In order to describe visible light, it is necessary to introduce some quantities related to light quality. These quantities are all defined based on the properties of human vision, more specifically on the wavelength-dependent sensitivity of our eyes (the eye-sensitivity curve) and the perception and rendering of colours.\nThere are two different eye-sensitivity curves, the photopic curve for well lit conditions and the scotopic curve for dimly lit conditions (such as moonlight). Generally, the photopic curve is used for quantities describing lighting quality. It has a roughly Gaussian shape peaking at 555 nm and bounded at 380 and 780 nm. There are multiple definitions of the photopic curve, but generally the CIE (International Commission on Illumination) 1931 standard curve is used. Using the eye sensitivity curve, we can define the \u2018amount\u2019 of light produced by a light source. This is called the luminous flux \u03a6v with units\nof lumens (lm) and is defined as\n\u03a6v = 683.002 lm W\u22121 \u00b7 \u222b \u221e\n0 y\u0304(\u03bb)\u03a6e,\u03bb(\u03bb)d\u03bb, (1)\nwith y\u0304(\u03bb) the normalized eye-sensitivity curve, \u03a6e,\u03bb(\u03bb) the spectral radiant flux in W nm\u22121 and \u03bb the wavelength [1]. The efficacy of a lamp is usually expressed in lm W\u22121. Its theoretical maximum value is 683 lm W\u22121, but this would require a 100% efficient monochromatic light source with a wavelength of 555 nm (green light) according to equation (1).\nMany light sources produce light which is perceived as white or close to white. White light is defined as a spectral distribution which in our perception closely resembles a spectral distribution of black body radiation according to Planck\u2019s law. The temperature of the corresponding black body is then called the correlated colour temperature (CCT) and generally ranges between about 2000 K (very warm, orange-like white) to above 10 000 K (blue-ish white).\nFinally, the colour rendering index (CRI) of a whitish light source is a measure of how well the light produced renders a variety of object colours (i.e., with each color associated with a specific reflection spectrum) in comparison to black body radiation of the same CCT. The most commonly used quantity for this is the CIE Ra standard which uses eight specified reflection spectra (sample colours). The Ra can be calculated from the lamp emission spectrum combined with these eight reflection spectra and the CCT determined from the lamp spectrum [1\u20133]. An Ra of 100 indicates a spectrum which is nearly identical to black body radiation, which is generally only achievable for incandescent light sources. White discharge and LED based light sources generally have an Ra between 50 and 90."

The recent emergence of microcavity plasma lamps has resulted in commerciallyavailable visible and UV/VUV sources that have generated new applications such as lamp-driven atomic clocks.\nLasers pumped by low temperature plasmas have played a pivotal role in the development of commercial optical systems and the critical physical mechanisms of the most important systems such as the carbon dioxide infrared (IR) laser and the rare gas-halide (UV/VUV) systems will be discussed in section 4.\nSection 5 discusses the control, manipulation, and detection of EM radiation in the microwave and mm-wave spectral regions with plasma photonic crystals (PPCs) and plasma metamaterials. Based on spatially-periodic arrays of low temperature plasmas, these artificial, electromagnetically-active\n2\nmaterials provide the opportunity to vary the dielectric permittivity of the plasma both spatially and temporally, thereby permitting the transmission, reflectance, polarization and other properties of EM waves to be controlled at electronic speeds. The principles underlying these emerging microwave and THz devices will be discussed.\nFinally, in section 6 we summarize our conclusions and discuss the outlook to the future of plasma photonics."

We define this category as the plasma-driven light sources that have been developed and produced by large traditional lighting companies such as Philips, GE and Osram. Currently, development in this field has virtually come to a standstill due to the move to LED-light sources by the lighting industry. However, the physics of these discharges remains relevant, for many other applications, and that will be our focus here.\nThe fact that plasma lamps have dominated the lighting industry for almost 150 years (replacing candles and kerosene or paraffin oil lamps in the early 20th century) is a testament to the ability of plasma to efficiently convert electrical power to visible photons."

            "heading": "2.1. Why is mercury so special?",
            "text": "The importance of mercury in discharge lamps can be categorized according to the type of lamp in which it is used.\n2.1.1. Fluorescent lamps. The most successful lamp from a commercial perspective is the Hg fluorescent lamp which is renowned for the efficiency with which the 6p3P1 state of neutral mercury at 4.99 eV is populated by direct electron impact excitation in a low-pressure rare gas/Hg glow discharge. This process is responsible for the economic success of the fluorescent lamp which first became available commercially from the General Electric Co. in 1938. Until the recent introduction of GaN-based LEDs, no lighting technology was able to surpass the efficiency or economy of this simple, but remarkable, optoelectronic device. Comprising a few mg of Hg situated inside a glass cylinder backfilled with rare gas (usually Ar, but Ne and Kr have been used in some fluorescent lamps) to a pressure of a few Torr, the fluorescent lamp typically employs hot (thermionic) cathodes and routinely achieves an efficiency of 70% for excitation of the Hg 3P1 resonance state of the atom from the ground state. The electron number densities in fluorescent lamps are in the range of 1010\u20131011 cm\u22123, Te \u2248 1 eV, and the number density of rare gas atoms is \u22482 orders of magnitude larger than that for Hg in the glow discharge. Following emission from an atom at 253.7 nm (the wavelength of the Hg 6p3P1 \u2192 6s1S0 (ground) transition, where the 6p3P1 state is populated by electron impact), the UV radiation impinges on a thin phosphor coating applied to the inner surface of the glass enclosure. This coating is typically a mixture of several rare earth-oxides (such as (Y, Gd)BO3:Eu3+ (red) and Zn2SiO4:Mn2+ (green)) that, upon absorbing a \u223c254 nm photon, emit red, green,\nor blue light. Therefore, by optimizing the composition of the phosphor mixture, the overall spectrum emitted by the lamp approximates blackbody emission of the desired CCT, ranging from \u223c2700 to 4100 K. Although the process of converting the ultraviolet emission from the mercury atom to visible light reduces the overall efficiency of the fluorescent lamp to 25%\u201330%, its luminous efficacy is nevertheless \u223c100 lm W\u22121, or approximately an order of magnitude greater than that obtainable with incandescent lamps. Mercury also has sufficient vapour pressure at room temperature to maintain a discharge. No other atom has both these features and has made this lamp successful for many decades.\n2.1.2. HID lamps. High intensity discharge (HID) lamps rely on a combination of atoms, molecules and ions for the emission of white light. These atoms are generated within the lamp by the thermal dissociation of metal-halide (MH) molecules, such as indium iodide or thallium iodide for blue and green light, respectively, in the vapor phase. In order to maintain the necessary temperatures, these lamps must operate at electrical deposition powers higher than those in fluorescent lamps. Mercury is also incorporated into most HID lamps because of its vapour pressure at the temperature(s) necessary to produce the required metal-halide molecular densities. Figure 1 is an artistic rendition of an HID lamp in which the most important components are labelled."

            "heading": "2.2. Radiation mechanisms",
            "text": "The principal processes that contribute to absorption and emission of radiation in the UV and visible regions of the EM spectrum are electronic transitions of atoms, atomic ions and molecules [4, 5]. Infrared (IR) emission and absorption arise primarily from vibrational and rotational transitions in diatomic or triatomic molecules, but also electronic transitions between atomic Rydberg eigenstates. Recombination of ions and electrons is also responsible for visible, UV and IR radiation.\nIn addition to atomic line emission, emission as a result of electronic transitions in molecules, as well as vibrational and rotational transitions, contributes to absorption and emission in some discharges. The extreme wings of atomic lines from high pressure lamps cover such a large spectral range that they may resemble molecular radiation bands. Free\u2013free and free\u2013bound transitions of free electrons, which result in absorption and emission of radiation over wide ranges of frequency (continuum emission) is generally less important than other radiation processes in discharge lamps. However, in some lamps bound\u2013free transitions form the basis for IR emissions. Electron\u2013atom Bremsstrahlung plays an important role in ultra-high pressure (150\u2013300 atm) lamps used for video and data projection applications.\nIn general, there is a mismatch of indices of refraction at the interface between the discharge gas and the wall, leading to a reflection loss, so that a portion of the internally generated radiation does not escape. In discharge lamps, the reflection losses are relatively small, approximately 4%\u20135% at each of several surfaces.\n3\n2.2.1. Self absorption/(extreme) line broadening. In most electric discharge lamps emission and absorption by electronic transitions in atoms (and atomic ions in MH lamps) are the dominant processes. Absorption and emission \u2018lines\u2019 in the radiation spectrum from such transitions are usually broadened by a variety of perturbing influences, such as:\n(a) Collisional or pressure broadening due to collisions between radiating and non-identical perturbing atoms,\n(b) Collisional Stark broadening from the electric fields of nearby electrons and ions,\n(c) Collisional resonance broadening as a result of perturbation of an atom radiating to the ground level by an identical atom in the ground level.\n(d) Doppler broadening as a result of thermal motion of the radiating atoms\nFluorescent lamps: Doppler broadening is the principal process that determines spectral line widths in fluorescent lamps. As noted in section 2.1.1, the dominant spectral line is that produced by emission from the 3P1 resonance level of mercury at 254 nm with an optical depth \u03c4 of 50\u2013100 at the centre of this line. This means that radiation near the centre of the line is completely absorbed and most of the light is emitted in the wings (i.e., far from line-centre) because of radiation trapping. As the mercury pressure increases, the number of atoms in resonance levels increases, but the confinement time also increases, and a greater fraction of energy used in creating excited mercury atoms is dissipated in nonradiative transitions. The situation is complicated by the presence of seven isotopes of mercury and the isotopic and hyperfine structure of the resonance lines plays an important role in radiation transport, reducing the trapping of the 254 nm radiation by a factor of five.\nHID lamps: the principal visible emitters in HID lamps are mercury atoms in mercury lamps, sodium atoms in high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps, and metal atoms in MH lamps. The line spectra of MH lamps are complex, with thousands of lines that are perceived by the human eye as \u2018white\u2019 light. Many of these atomic lines are pressure broadened and self reversed. Most of the visible radiation emitted by HPS lamps, for example, lies in the red wings of the Na D2 and D1 lines at 588.9 nm and 589.6 nm, respectively. Virtually no emission occurs at the resonance lines themselves because radiation trapping is strong and the spectral line is inverted. The sodium pressure in HPS lamps (100 Torr) is chosen so as to maximise efficacy (\u223c150 lm W\u22121) but with a CRI \u223c22. Increasing sodium pressure broadens the yellow line to yellow\u2013orange, where the eye is less sensitive and some lamps produce \u2018white\u2019 light with a CRI of 80 but an efficacy of only \u223c50 lm W\u22121. Small mercury lamps operating at high power and extremely high pressures produce \u2018white\u2019 light due to pressure broadening of the visible lines, and these have been used for projection applications [6]."

            "heading": "2.3. Species densities and particle transport",
            "text": "For most HID lamp types, light emission is directly coupled to the density of atomic metals in the centre of the arc. A large density is generally required for the desired light output, as well as for achieving the desired spectral properties such as colour point and colour rendering. In sodium-based lamps, this is relatively straightforward due to the high vapour pressure of metallic sodium (or when dosed as an amalgam with mercury). A coldest-spot temperature of 973 K already leads to a vapour pressure of over 104 Pa for pure sodium.\nHowever, in order to efficiently produce white light with good colour rendering properties, the addition of other metals\n4\nsuch as the rare earth metals cerium and dysprosium, indium and thorium is required. However, these cannot be dosed in the form of pure metals because their vapour pressures at acceptable wall temperatures are far too low. This can be solved by dosing MHs (generally iodides) instead of the pure metals. Such MHs have much higher vapour pressures than the metals. They form a molten salt pool at the coldest spot of the lamp and its temperature determines their density in the gas phase. Inside the hot arc, the MHs dissociate into their elemental constituents, which then produce light with the required spectrum [7, 8].\nInside an HID lamp, many different processes cause transport of species. Most important of these for gaseous species are: ordinary diffusion, natural convection and cataphoresis (drift of electrons and ions in an electric field). Such transport of species, can under certain conditions lead to gradients in densities of certain species along the axis of symmetry, which in turn can lead to gradients in light colour. Lamps are generally made to produce one specific colour of light, so any gradient in light output colour is undesirable.\nIn low-frequency or DC-driven lamps, cataphoresis can occur but generally it is only significant locally around the electrodes, where it is an important factor in gas-phase emitter effects like discussed in section 2.4 [9].\nNatural convection, combined with ordinary diffusion and chemistry on the other hand, can lead to large species gradients and thus changes in light colour along the symmetry axis, so-called demixing or axial segregation [10, 11]. This effect is caused by the difference in diffusion constant between MHs (e.g. CeI3) and their dissociation products Ce and I. The latter are produced on the hot lamp axis diffuse faster outwards than the MHs diffuse inwards, leading to a gradient in elemental Ce density away from the axis. This is partly replenished by natural convection (in a vertically operated lamp), leading to higher metal concentrations at the bottom of the lamp. Because the difference in diffusivity is specific for each MH, its effects will also be different. This leads to a gradient in the ratio between the different components along the lamp axis and thereby colour demixing. In limiting cases where only diffusion or convection are present, demixing is absent, but will be present in all other cases [10]."

            "text": "The majority of plasma light sources use electrodes to couple the electrical power into the discharge. Exceptions are electrodeless lamps, which will be discussed below. The electrode is one of the most important, but also one of the most difficult, components of lamps and is the major failure mechanism in most discharge lamps. Most challenging are the lifetimes of the electrode itself and of its feedthrough.\nThe major challenge for the feedthrough is to remain leaktight for the entire lamp-life, which is not easy to achieve considering the large thermal stresses, especially for HID lamps. Consequently, the feedthrough material, the feedthrough material is chosen such that it has the same thermal expansion coefficient as the lamp envelope material. For polycrystalline alumina envelopes, niobium is generally the metal of choice\n[12]. For quartz (fused silica) envelopes however, this is not possible due to its extremely low thermal expansion. Instead, thin ellipsoidal molybdenum strips are employed, which can compensate for this misfit [13, 14].\nElectrode lifetime is mainly determined by its temperature. Because most discharge lamps operate with alternating current, electrodes have to switch function from anode to cathode and back many times per second, each with their own heat input mechanism. Anode heating is unavoidable but relatively straightforward [15] and its impact can quite easily be regulated by changing the electrode tip surface area. A cathode however, requires a certain temperature to operate properly, as is discussed below. In some cases it can also easily switch between a spot-type attachment and a diffuse attachment [16, 17], leading to unstable lamp performance. Together, this puts higher demands on the electrode design.\nTemperature related issues are mitigated firstly by using tungsten as the electrode material. Tungsten is the pure metal with the highest melting point (3695 K) and has a low vapour pressure at high temperatures. However, this is not sufficient to ensure a long lamp life at high temperatures. The Richardson\u2013Schottky equation [18, 19] determines the current density j:\nj = AT2 exp\n( e\u03a6eff(E)\nkBT\n) , (2)\nwith A the Richardson constant, T the surface temperature, kB Boltzmann\u2019s constant, e the elementary charge and \u03a6eff(E) the effective work function defined as\n\u03a6eff(E) = \u03a6\u2212 \u221a\neE 4\u03c0\u03b50 , (3)\n(the Schottky effect) with \u03a6 the material work function, E the electric field at the surface and \u03b50 the vacuum permittivity. This shows that in order to reach the desired high current densities and still ensure reasonably low electrode temperatures, the surface should have a low work function, preferably much lower than that of pure tungsten, which is approximately 4.5 eV.\nFor lamps with low temperatures and gas fillings that are not too aggressive, this can be achieved by coating the tungsten electrode with an emitter material. This is done in fluorescent lamps for example, by coating the electrode with a mixture of BaO, SrO and CaO [7, 20], while in HPS lamps, windings of the tungsten electrode assembly are filled with a Ba-containing mixture [12]. In many other HID lamps, the tungsten electrode is doped with ThO2. Finally, for lamps with a filling that is too aggressive to permit a long lifetime using any of these solutions, a so-called \u2018gas-phase emitter\u2019 is required. In this case, some of the gas-phase components, such as CeI3 or DyI3 can form a mono-layer on the electrode surface, thereby reducing the effective work function and hence the surface temperature [9, 19, 21].\nOne example of a gas discharge lamp that can operate at high current densities and temperatures without any emitter material is the ultra high pressure short arc projection lamp [22], where an advanced current shape system can control tungsten transport towards or away from the hot tip.\n5"

            "text": "Since failure of electrodes in discharge lamps is one of the major limitations on lamp life, it was a goal of the lighting industry to develop lamps without electrodes for almost a century before it was commercially realized. In fact Tesla, in 1891, demonstrated that light could be generated in a plasma in the presence of an electric field. However, due to the size and cost of the electronics needed to drive these lamps, successful products were only launched on the market a century later, when suitable electronics became available.\nThere are four distinct types of excitation possible for electrodeless discharge lamps [5, 23]: (a) inductive discharges; (b) capacitive discharges; (c) microwave discharges and (d) travelling wave discharges. Although all of these methods have been investigated for application to lighting, in practice only two of these methods (inductive and microwave) have been successfully applied to commercial light sources.\nInductive or H discharges. The discharge current through the plasma of an H discharge acts as a single-turn secondary loop of a transformer excited with a primary coil which may be placed in or around the discharge. Provided sufficient power is applied to maintain the H discharge, high coupling efficiencies may be achieved at low frequencies, with the benefit of less expensive electronics.\nMicrowave discharges. These lamps are based on the concept of the resonant cavity [5, 24]. The wavelength of the EM field is comparable to the dimensions of the exciting structure and vessel. As in inductive discharges, these lamps have maximum efficacy at higher powers.\nThe development of inductively coupled fluorescent lamps was greatly accelerated in the late 1980s by the ready availability of inexpensive and efficient semiconductor electronics and power switching. There are two principal designs that were successfully introduced into the market. The first method was to introduce an inductive coil in the centre of a bulb shaped like a regular incandescent lamp [5, 23]. The second was to use an external coil to drive a current through a toroidal shaped lamp [5, 25]. The major application of these lamps was for outdoor lighting, due to their high efficacy at higher powers. A number of HID electrodeless lamps were introduced into the market based on microwave resonant cavity technology, but they met with very limited success. The principal advantage of these lamps was their small size, making them ideal for point source applications such as high mast street lighting, but they could not match the efficacy of LEDs."

            "text": "Microplasma is the term given to low temperature plasma confined to cavities having mesoscopic dimensions (typically <1 mm). Although the cavity geometry can take on many forms, the most prevalent is a cylinder having a diameter d. As illustrated by the generalized diagram of figure 2, however, one of the earliest geometries adopted for the microcavity is that of an inverted square pyramid etched into Si by a wet, anisotropic process. The motivation for adopting this particular microcavity geometry in early studies was the desire to fabricate arrays of microcavities in which each microcavity is a precise reproduction of a given design. The silicon microelectronics industry demonstrated decades ago that the difference between the wet-etching rates for the (100) and (111) planes of Si allows one to produce square pyramids in an Si(100) surface that are virtually identical, and the surfaces of the pyramids are essentially atomically smooth. Such uniformity from microcavity-to-microcavity was essential for exploring the physics, and comparing the characteristics, of microcavity arrays with respect to those of flat plate dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasmas, for example. In the design of figure 2, polyimide films serve as the dielectric, and one electrode is a nickel film whereas the second is the doped semiconductor substrate itself. Microcavities can also be fabricated in a wide variety of dielectric materials, including ceramics and glasses, by processes adopted from the semiconductor industry (such as wet and dry etching, microand nano-imprinting, and photolithography). However, fabrication processes developed specifically for realizing arrays of microcavity plasma devices have resulted in materials and architectures not normally employed in plasma science. As an example, figure 3 is an optical micrograph in plan view (i.e., viewed from above) of a portion of a large array of microplasmas having parabolic cross-sectional cavities and an upper circular aperture with a diameter of 150 \u03bcm. Formed from aluminium foil by a wet electrochemical process, the microcavities have precisely-controlled cross-sectional geometries with sidewalls that can be \u2018tuned\u2019 continuously between linear and parabolic. From an electrical perspective, microplasma devices are powered either by direct exposure of the two electrodes to the plasma or by a DBD configuration in which one or both of the electrodes is buried in a dielectric film. The primary advantage of the latter is that erosion of, or chemical damage to, the electrodes is eliminated and, therefore, DBD devices can be designed to be quite robust. However, DBD architectures require that the voltage waveform driving the plasma must be time-varying. The microplasma array of figure 3 provides a valuable illustration of the design guideline that the choice of microcavity cross-section is influenced by several factors, including the application at hand and the desired variation of electric field strength within the cavity. In effect, the wall of the cavity may serve several purposes of which two are electrical and optical. The parabolic, or ellipsoidal, microcavities of figure 3, for example, are often of interest when the optical power output from each cavity must be maximized. Ellipsoidal cavities have long been implemented in the flashlamp reflectors of solid-state lasers for the\n6\npurpose of directing pump light efficiently onto a laser rod. Borrowing from the laser community, therefore, has yielded parabolic or ellipsoidal microcavities that reflect and shape the light emission generated within each cavity.\nBecause the physics and properties of microplasmas have been described previously in a number of excellent reviews [30\u201332], only a few of their salient characteristics will be described here. Foremost among these is the pressure range over which stable, spatially-uniform glows can be generated on a pulsed or continuous (CW) basis. Although microplasma operation does not strictly follow pd scaling (where p is the background gas pressure and d is the characteristic dimension of the microcavity), streamer-free discharges are readily generated in the rare gases (for example) at pressures between 50 Torr and several atmospheres in microcavities for which 30 \u03bcm < d < 500 \u03bcm. A second important property of microcavity plasmas is that they generally operate in the abnormal glow regime. Consequently, the V\u2013I characteristics exhibit positive resistivity, and ballast is not required, in contrast to the Ar\u2013Hg fluorescent lamp which typically incorporates an\ninductive ballast. Nevertheless, ballast remains desirable in the drive circuitry for microplasma arrays, in particular, as a current-limiting precaution, and a convenient solution for microplasma device arrays fabricated in silicon is to adjust the resistivity of the semiconductor substrate through the Si doping levels.\nSince microcavity plasmas are generated at pressures up to several atmospheres and in cavities with volumes of picoliters to microliters, it is not surprising that the ranges in electron density (ne), electron temperature (Te), and specific power loadings (Ps, expressed in W cm\u22123) characteristic of these plasmas are, as a group, unprecedented. Assuming, for example, a fractional ionization of 10\u22125 for a CW abnormal glow discharge at a pressure of 1 bar implies an electron density of 1014 cm\u22123. Indeed, experiments of the past two decades have demonstrated that, depending upon the microcavity design, fill gas mixture and pressure, and driving voltage, steady-state ne values of 1012\u20131015 cm\u22123 are obtained routinely in CW microplasmas. Pulsed excitation has extended the range in peak electron densities in rare gas plasmas from 1016 to >1017 cm\u22123 [33], and figure 4 shows that such values for the electron number density place microcavity plasmas in uncharted territory. Prepared by Prof. Tachibana [34], this figure is a map of a portion of plasma parameter space in which the characteristic dimension of the plasma (d), shown by the abscissa, ranges from 100 mm to 10\u22125 mm. The right-hand ordinate of this graph (at left) begins with electron number densities as low as 1012 cm\u22123, and the left-hand ordinate gives corresponding values of the plasma frequency (\u03c9p). Notice that the region representing macroscopic plasmas is indicated by the \u2018traditional plasma area\u2019 at lower left. Microplasmas occupy the region bounded by 1 mm and \u223c1 \u03bcm on the abscissa and \u223c1012\u20131017 cm\u22123 on the ordinate. As noted by Prof. Tachibana in figure 4, one would expect the properties of plasmas in this region to be localized (both spatially and temporally for pulsed plasmas, in particular), and highlynonequilibrium. Several applications of microplasmas are also indicated in figure 4, including VUV and extreme ultraviolet light sources and EM wave control devices. Both of these will be discussed in the following sections. The equally important application of analytical tools is also represented in figure 4, where \u2018m-TAS\u2019 refers to \u2018micro-total analysis systems\u2019. One implication of the electron densities prevalent in microplasmas is the extraordinary specific power loading, expressed in W cm\u22123, of the plasma medium.\nSince the minimum power required to sustain the plasma is proportional to ne and the energy cost/electron, but inversely proportional to the electron lifetime, an electron density of 1015 cm\u22123 in Ne, for example, suggests that the deposition of at least a few kW cm\u22123 would be required. Experiments confirm this estimate by demonstrating that specific power depositions of tens of kW cm\u22123 are typically necessary for maintenance of the plasma, and values as large as \u223c1 MW cm\u22123 have been observed. Others have noted that such enormous power loadings of microplasmas are of the same magnitude as those for the excitation of 1\u20135 atm plasmas by beams of relativistic electrons that are often employed for driving lasers. Of course, the small volumes of microcavity plasmas result in\n7\nreasonable demands being placed on power supplies, despite the extraordinary specific power loadings of microplasmas.\nOwing to the small dimensions of microplasmas, the plasma sheath often occupies a significant fraction of the volume available within the plasma device itself. For example, a microplasma having a fractional ionization of 10\u22125 implies a time-averaged electron density of 1014 cm\u22123 which corresponds to a Debye length \u03bbD = 10 \u03bcm (cf figure 4). Assuming that the effective sheath thickness (Ls) is \u223c5\u03bbD and the plasma resides within a 100 \u03bcm-diameter cylinder, then one concludes that the sheath encompasses the crosssectional area of the cylinder. Although not shown in figure 4, the locus of all points given by the relation: d = 5\u03bbD represents microplasmas for which the sheath extends across the entirety of the cross-section of a cylindrical microcavity (since the sheath is an annulus). Because the ratio E/N (where E is the magnitude of the local electric field, and N is the background gas number density) is known to be largest in the sheath region of low temperature plasmas, the relative volume of a microcavity occupied by the plasma sheath is responsible for the large values of ne and Te observed for microplasmas. The latter is related to the local electric field strength by: (Te \u2212 Tg) \u221d (E/N)2, where Tg is the background gas temperature [35, 36].\nExperiments and simulations have confirmed expectations that the magnitude of the sheath electric field, | E|, near a microcavity wall normally exceeds 104 V cm\u22121. A test performed in [37] involved growing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) within a cylindrical plasma device and comparing the electrical characteristics of DC rare gas microplasmas with, and in the absence of, the CNTs. As shown in figure 5, the introduction of CNTs (right-hand panel, figure 5) onto the microcavity wall reduces the ignition voltage for these DC-driven devices by as much as >20%, and differentiates the V\u2013I characteristics\nwith respect to pressure. The sharp decline in ignition and operating voltages is attributed to Fowler\u2013Nordheim (field) electron emission from the CNTs which are situated in the sheath. In a manner similar to the function of thermionic emitters in fluorescent lamps, field emission reduces the cathode fall voltage in the plasmas of figure 5 by injecting electrons into the sheath, thereby requiring the ions to carry a smaller fraction of the current in the sheath. Since the \u2018turn-on\u2019 electric field strengths for CNTs are known to be on the order of 1 V \u03bcm\u22121, we regard this value as a lower limit which also suggests that E/N > 50\u2013100 Td (where Td represents one Townsend = 10\u221217 V cm2) for atmospheric pressure plasmas.\nAnother ramification of the small volumes of microplasmas is the influence of the electronic structure of the wall material on plasma properties and photonic device performance. Consider, for example, the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cylindrical plasma which scales inversely with the diameter d. Consequently, the surface area-to-volume ratio for a 100 \u03bcm-diameter microplasma is two orders of magnitude larger than that for a macroscopic, low temperature plasma having a diameter of 1 cm. One would expect, therefore, that plasma\u2013surface interactions would have a larger role in determining the characteristics of microplasmas, and this has proven to be the case. One example is the experiments described in [38] in which the interaction of the sheath electric field with a semiconductor surface was leveraged so as to bend both the conduction and valence bands of Si in a thin region at the semiconductor\u2013plasma interface. Since the position of the Fermi level remains unchanged, band-bending induced by the plasma sheath has the effect of producing a thin, n-type region near the surface of the p-Si substrate. The distance that the sheath electric field extends into the semiconductor is dependent upon the acceptor doping level in the substrate, and the slope of the conduction and valence bands at a particular\n8\ndistance from the substrate surface is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field at that depth. Such local control of the semiconductor energy bands by a plasma sheath enabled the realization of microplasma/semiconductor photodetectors [38]. This interaction between solid-state (electron/hole) and gas phase (electron/ion) plasmas appears to have considerable potential for the development of photonic devices but will not be discussed further here.\nBefore leaving this section, it must be emphasized that perhaps the most unique asset of microcavity plasmas is the ability provided by micro- and nano-fabrication techniques to control the geometry of the microcavity, including details such as the contour and roughness of surfaces, to a level of precision not possible previously. It was noted earlier that by combining fabrication processes developed by the semiconductor device industry with techniques introduced specifically for microplasmas, it has become possible to fabricate large arrays of microplasma devices having cavities of almost arbitrary cross-section [32]. In essence, one now has the ability to dictate the material(s), topography, and contour of the wall surrounding the plasma. The dimensions of macroscopic plasmas and their associated electrodes and enclosures have, in general, precluded such a capability in the past. One implication of the control over the cavity cross-section that is currently available is the concomitant control one has over the profile of the electric field magnitude throughout the cavity. Figure 6 shows (at left) a diagram of a linear array of cylindrical microcavities fabricated in ceramic by a process developed by the electronics industry and often employed in the production of capacitors [39]. The electrodes are composed of silver paste screenprinted onto \u2018green ceramic tape\u2019 and the ceramic assembly is fired after the structure is finalized. Note that the electrode strips are parallel and run astride the array of microcavities (viewed end-on and represented by the solid circles), one electrode on each side of the array. At upper right in figure 6 is an optical micrograph (recorded in plan view) of the visible\nemission from Ne microplasmas, at a pressure of 400 Torr, generated in a portion of a linear array of 127 \u03bcm diameter cavities, and having the structure at left. Note the tapering of the plasma towards the centre of the cavity which results from the curvature of the cavity wall and the abrupt change in the dielectric constant across the plasma/ceramic interface. At lower right in figure 6 are false colour maps (at right) of the visible emission intensity generated when the pressure is again 400 Torr. The image at lower right was recorded with a charge-coupled device detector and imaging optics in the same manner as that for the upper image, with the exception that a filter having a neutral density of one was inserted into the beam path. Doing so prevents the image from being saturated. From this lower image, an intensity lineout was recorded along the longitudinal axis of the image, as indicated by the white arrow. Denoted by the blue curve at left, the lineout shows clearly the rapid decline in fluorescence intensity as the axis of the microplasma is approached. The red curve at lower right in figure 6 is the intensity lineout obtained when the Ne pressure is raised to 800 Torr. On the basis of figure 6, one concludes that the combination of the buried electrode arrangement, the cross-sectional geometry of the cavities, and the contour and permittivity of the dielectric determine the observed electric field spatial profile. Therefore, although microcavity plasmas offer enormous flexibility in the choice of cavity geometry, it is clear that several design factors are interlocked."

            "text": "Conventional low-temperature plasma lamps are excited almost exclusively by direct electron impact of the ground state species. Therefore, selective excitation of high-lying electronic states of neutrals or ions in a plasma by direct electron impact is generally not possible because the lowestenergy inelastic thresholds dictate the behaviour of the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) at higher energies. As a\n9\nresult, the electron impact excitation rates for atoms favour the lowest-lying excited states of the neutral or ionic species, and the time-averaged populations of atomic levels in a glow discharge, for example, typically descend monotonically with increasing energy of the excited state. It is for this reason that the preponderance of the emission from all existing lamps driven by low temperature plasma emanates from the lowestlying atomic or molecular energy levels. Examples include the Hg/Ar fluorescent lamp described in section 2.1.1, the lowpressure Na (588.9, 589.5 nm) lamps prominent on expressways in the US and, in the VUV spectral region, the H2, D2, and rare-gas atomic lamps. In short, all existing commercial lamps rely on populating the emitting states thermally (in an arc) or through direct electron impact from the atomic or molecular species ground state in a low-pressure glow discharge.\nEach of the properties of microcavity plasmas discussed above are pivotal to their success in applications such as lamps. One of the defining characteristics of microplasmas is their propensity to operate stably at pressures of 1 bar and beyond, as opposed to macroscopic, low temperature plasmas which are typically generated at gas pressures of a few Torr or less. The implications of the atmospheric-pressure operating capability of microplasmas are profound insofar as applications are concerned. Specifically, collisions between \u2018heavy particles\u2019\u2014atoms and molecules\u2014can now dominate the plasma chemistry, allowing the collisional kinetics to be tailored so as to favour the production of a specific species such\nas ozone, a particular ion, or an efficiently radiating atom or molecule. Collisions of ground state atoms and molecules with electrons accelerated by the electric field remain the primary route by which power is coupled into the plasma but, beyond that point, the manner in which the plasma disposes of the input power can often be steered with a remarkable degree of specificity into various \u2018exit channels\u2019. Although plasma chemistry at atmospheric pressures provides the opportunity to influence the predominant plasma products, the challenge of collisional kinetics in microcavity plasmas (and all atmospheric-pressure plasmas) is identifying those unique situations which lend themselves to a commercial or research application. One of these is the realization of efficient lamps generating photons having energies above \u223c5 eV.\nSeveral collisional processes in a plasma have been employed to transfer energy, deposited into the electron gas by the imposed E-field, from one species to another. Among these are:\n(a) Excitation transfer: A\u2217 + B \u2192 A + B\u2217 + \u0394E (b) Charge transfer: A+ + B \u2192 A + B+ (c) Quenching (de-excitation): A\u2217\u2217 + M \u2192 A\u2217 + M (d) Molecular formation: A\u2217 + B + M \u2192 (AB)\u2217 + M, where A and B may be atoms or molecules, M is any background species (atomic or molecular), \u0394E is the difference in energy between A\u2217 and B\u2217 (i.e., the energy beyond that necessary to produce B\u2217), and the double asterisk in (c) denotes\n10\na state lying higher in energy than A\u2217. Because the rates at which reactions (a)\u2013(c) proceed is proportional to the pressure of gas constituent B or M, the high-pressure operation afforded by microplasmas increases these rates accordingly, thereby raising the efficiency associated with the production of the species of interest. Collisional process (d) is also known as a three-body collision, and M is any background atom or molecule in the gas mixture. The presence of M in (d) is necessary to conserve momentum, and its participation in the reaction results in the collision rate scaling as the product of the pressures of B and M. Specific examples of processes (a) and (d) will be discussed in the next section.\nBecause E/N, Te, and ne in low temperature plasma are interconnected, the large values of the electric field strength, E, typical of a microplasma (>104 V cm\u22121) are responsible for the increased values of ne and Te, relative to those for macroscopic glow discharges. Consequently, microplasmas offer more efficient access (via direct electron impact) to atomic or molecular states lying more than 5\u201310 eV above ground, as observed in early studies of microplasma emission spectra [27, 40, 41]. Increasing Te shifts the EEDF to higher electron energies, thereby increasing the inelastic collision rate. The elevated values of electron density in microplasma devices are of particular importance to the plasma EM devices discussed in section 5, primarily because of the influence of ne on the dielectric permittivity (\u03b5p) of the plasma medium. Since the permittivity determines the refractive index of the medium at a given probe frequency, the control of the electron density offered by microplasmas in plasma metamaterials and PPCs results in the ability to manipulate EM radiation in the microwave, mm-wave, and THz portions of the spectrum."

            "text": "Xe2 (172 nm)\nAs described in the preceding sections, the unique properties of microplasma are responsible for the efficiency, output power, and form factor of lamps based on arrays of microcavity plasma arrays. Such capabilities are not available to other UV emitters such as thermal arcs and UV LEDs, for example, and the recent introduction of microplasma lamps has increased the average output power of incoherent, sub-250 nm wavelength sources, in particular, by orders of magnitude. Speaking broadly, arrays of microcavity plasmas arrays have proven to be efficient converters of stored electrical energy to visible, UV, and VUV radiant energy, and two examples of lamps developed over the past decade are presented here.\nA wide range of applications for lamps and lasers requires access to visible, ultraviolet, and VUV transitions of atoms and molecules involving excited states of the neutral or singlyionized species. One recent example is that of the microwave 199Hg ion clock which requires VUV emission locked to the 62P1/2 \u2192 62S1/2 transition of the singly-charged Hg ion at 194 nm to drive the clock optical cycle [42, 43]. Details regarding the operation of the clock itself can be found in references [42, 43], but suffice it to say that the Hg+ clock operates at the highest frequency of all ion clocks (40.507 GHz) which is primarily responsible for its immunity to stray or ambient magnetic fields, relative to (for example) the Rb 6.8 GHz\nclock. Because the Hg+ ( 62 P1/2) upper level for the 194 nm (6.4 eV) transition lies 16.8 eV above the neutral Hg ground state, populating this radiating state directly from ground by electron impact is inefficient. Until recently, the optical source for the Hg+ clock has been an inductively-coupled,RF-excited (100\u2013200 MHz) Ar/202Hg plasma lamp having an Ar background pressure of \u223c1 Torr. However, microplasma-driven, He/202Hg lamps have been shown to generate 194 nm intensities a factor of \u223c1.8 larger than that obtainable from conventional, RF-driven low-pressure lamps, despite an internal lamp (and plasma) volume a factor of \u223c45 smaller than that of the lamps available previously.\nFigure 7 is a qualitative diagram illustrating both the dominant collisional processes and states responsible for the operation of the 194 nm microplasma lamp. Because electron impact excitation of Hg alone primarily populates strongly-radiating atomic levels lying well below the Hg ion state of interest (62P1/2), it is desirable to bypass these low-lying neutral Hg states entirely by making He the primary constituent of the microplasma gas mixture. Doing so results in a substantial fraction of the power delivered to the He/Hg vapour plasma residing briefly in the lowest excited states of He: the 23S (metastable) and 21S (resonance) states which lie at \u223c20 and \u223c25 eV, respectively. Because of the high operating pressure capability of microplasmas, however, the excited He atoms are converted to electronically-excited He dimers (He2\u2217) by the three-body collision of reaction (d) where M and B are both He atoms, and He2\u2217 subsequently populates the 62P1/2 state of Hg+ through excitation transfer collisions (reaction (a)) with ground state Hg. Because the latter process results in ionizing Hg, this collision is also known as Penning ionization.\nA series of microplasma lamps designed to generate emission preferentially on the 6p2P1/2 \u2192 6s2S1/2 transition of 202Hg+ at 194.23 nm has been developed and characterized extensively for the purpose of driving 40.5 GHz 199Hg ion clocks developed by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Figure 8 shows photographs of one of the miniature lamps\n11\n(internal volume of \u223c43 mm3) fabricated and characterized for this programme. Owing to the \u223c2 orders-of-magnitude increase in the volumetric power density (i.e., W cm\u22123) radiated by the microplasma lamps at 194 nm (relative to RFpowered, low-pressure lamps), clock stabilities <10\u221211 with integration times of a few seconds and a stability floor of \u223c10\u221214 were achieved [42].\nThe most powerful and efficient microplasma lamp developed to date is the Xe2 lamp at 172 nm (h\u03bd = 7.2 eV) in the VUV spectral region [44]. Although emission in the VUV from the Xe2 molecule has been known since the 1950s and macroscopic, RF-driven or pulsed lamps have long been commercially-available [45], microplasma lamps have been found to be capable of generating unprecedented levels of power from small volumes. Excitation of the molecule in low temperature plasma again begins with electron impact excitation of the atom to populate predominantly the lowest excited states of the atom. Cross-sections for electron impact excitation rates for the four lowest-lying excited states of Xe (6s[3/2]2, 6s[3/2]1, 6s[1/2]0, and 6s[1/2]1) are given in figure 9(b). As an aside, the spectroscopic notation for the excited states of the rare gas atoms differs from standard LS state designations by first denoting the orbital of the excited state (6s, in this case). Because all of the excited states of the rare gases are Rydberg (i.e., hydrogenic), the bracketed portion of the state designation represents the magnitude of the total angular momentum (| J|) for the ion core associated with a particular state (3/2 and 1/2 for the rare gases).\nElectron impact cross-sections adopted for Xe, available from LXCat (Biagi database) [46], are those shown in figure 9(b) and the EEDFs were calculated with BOLSIG+ [47], assuming E/N to initially be 100 Td (c.f. figure 9(a)). On the basis of the data of figure 9(b), as well as the BOLSIG+ EEDF calculations (such as those of panel (a) of figure 9), the excitation rates for the population of low-lying Xe states by electron impact are readily computed. Doing so, one finds that discharge power is delivered predominantly by inelastic collisions to the 6s[3/2]1 resonance state of Xe (the second lowest-lying excited state of the atom) because of the dominance of the cross-section associated with this eigenstate. Somewhat unexpected, however, is the observation that the two largest electron impact excitation cross-sections for Xe\nabove 20 eV in figure 9(b) are those associated with the 6s[3/2]1 and 6s[1/2]1 states of Xe, atomic levels that are optically-connected to ground by single photon transitions. That is, the relative magnitude of electron-impact excitation rates in low temperature plasma are generally correlated with the optical transition probabilities. We should not be surprised by this well-known correspondence, but its consequence is that metastable atomic and molecular states can be populated by direct electron impact from ground but this direct route is, as noted earlier, quite ineffective. As one might also expect, a significant reduction in electron-impact excitation rates results from lower values of E/N, attesting to the importance of the elevated values of E/N provided by microcavity plasmas in efficiently populating atomic and molecular excited states.\nFollowing the population of the low principal quantum number excited states of Xe by inelastic, electron\u2013neutral collisions, the Xe2\u2217 excimer is formed in the low-lying a3\u03a3+u (metastable) and A\n1\u03a3+u states through three-body collisions with background Xe atoms (equation (4)), as described previously with regard to the He/Hg lamp. The latter molecular state has a short radiative lifetime, and intense emission on the A1\u03a3+u \u2192 X1\u03a3+g transition occurs where X1\u03a3+g is the weakly-bound ground state of this molecule. Because the formation rate of Xe2\u2217 scales quadratically with the Xe pressure, the intensity of the 172 nm radiation rises rapidly as the Xe partial pressure in the lamp is increased up to (and beyond) 500 Torr, as shown in panel (c) of figure 9. If the increase in collisional quenching of the emitting species that accompanies the rising pressure is negligible, then the integrated fluorescence can be expected to scale as the square of the pressure since the relative fluorescence intensity is proportional to the instantaneous value of the Xe2\u2217 number density. To date, 172 nm emission intensities beyond 300 mW cm\u22122 with peak emission powers of 600\u2013800 W in a bandwidth of 9 nm have been obtained from flat Xe2 microplasma lamps [44]. Having an active surface area of \u223c100 cm2, such lamps are now capable of generating average powers at 172 nm exceeding 30 W which, with respect to the VUV lamp output powers available in the past, is an extraordinary value. The combination of the photon energy (7.2 eV) and the intensities now available from microplasma\n12\narray lamps emitting at discrete wavelengths in the \u223c150\u2013350 nm wavelength interval provide the opportunity to pursue commercial applications of VUV photochemistry, including nanopatterning of polymer films by photoablation [48]. A photograph of a 10 \u00d7 10 cm2 (4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 4\u2032\u2032) Xe2 microplasma lamp is shown at left in figure 10.\nBecause microplasmas efficiently populate the lowest excited states of, for example, Xe by electron impact, lamps\nemitting visible or UV radiation from other Xe-bearing molecules can also be expected to be efficient. Toward that end, xenon chloride (XeCl) microplasma lamps have also been developed and one of these flat lamps is shown in the righthand portion of figure 10. Virtually all of the power emitted by the lamp arises from the B \u2192 X transition of XeCl at 308 nm, but the blue\u2013green glow is faint emission from the Xe2Cl\u2217 triatomic excimer which is also generated within the lamp\n13\nplasma in small quantities. The kinetic sequence by which XeCl (and other rare gas-halide molecules) is formed differs from that for Xe2\u2217 only by the Xe\u2217 + Cl2 \u2192 (XeCl)\u2217 + Cl collision, known in physical chemistry as the \u2018harpoon\u2019 reaction. Similarly, the XeO\u2217 excimer molecule is well-known to manufacturers of conventional Xe lamps because only a few ppm of room air contaminating an atmospheric pressure Xe plasma by way of an inadvertent leak will produce the familiar green fluorescence from the electronically-excited molecule (\u223c550\u2013560 nm). A more detailed discussion of the rare gashalides and other excimer molecules can be found in reference [49], and the comments of section 4."

            "text": "Following the report of the successful demonstration of the ruby laser (Cr3+/Al2O3) by Maiman in the spring of 1960 [50], the laser community was quick to adopt low temperature plasma as a versatile and powerful medium for populating (\u2018pumping\u2019) the upper laser level. The first ultraviolet laser, demonstrated by Heard [51] in N2 at 337.1 nm, and the copper vapour laser (578.2, 510.5 nm) [52], are early examples of commercially-successful lasers pumped by direct electron impact. However, the stringent requirement imposed by optical oscillators for pumping specific states of an atom or molecule drove researchers to pursue collisional mechanisms capable of routing energy from the excited atomic or molecular states initially populated by electron impact to other, desired states or entirely different species. The first example of this energy transfer concept was the He\u2013Ne laser, demonstrated in 1961 by Javan and co-workers [53], in which the lowest excited states of He (the 23S and 21S metastable and resonance states) at 19.8 eV and 24.6 eV, respectively, are populated by electron impact or collisional mixing, and their internal energy is transferred to specific excited states of Ne by excitation transfer collisions: He\u2217 + Ne\u2192Ne\u2217 + He. This heavy particle collision is vital to the subsequent lasing which occurs on optical transitions of atomic Ne in the red and near-IR regions (632.8 nm, 1.15 \u03bcm). Specifically, if one attempts to observe\nlasing on the visible and near-IR transitions of neutral Ne, for example, solely by direct electron impact excitation of Ne itself, laser emission is either weak (with pulsed excitation) or cannot be obtained.\nThe most powerful and efficient plasma-based systems introduced in the six decades since the advent of the first gas lasers, carbon dioxide and the rare gas-halide (denoted RgX) excimer lasers, also require one or more collisions between excited atoms or molecules to reach the upper laser level and do so efficiently. As described in section 3.3, the diatomic rare gas-halide molecules, including krypton fluoride (KrF) and XeCl, are produced in atmospheric-pressure plasmas containing a mixture of rare gases and a halogen donor molecule such as F2, NF3, or HCl. The latter is the minority constituent of the gas mixture and the plasma E/N value is chosen so as to efficiently populate the lowest-lying resonance states of the desired rare gas, denoted ns[3/2]1, where n = 3\u20136 for Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively. Production of the electronicallyexcited RgX\u2217 molecule from its atomic constituents occurs by the harpoon collision (Kr\u2217(5s[3/2]2) + F2 \u2192 KrF\u2217 + F, for example) mentioned in section 3.3. This collision results in the nascent molecule residing in high vibrational states of the lowest-lying electronic excited state, B2\u03a3+1/2. Subsequent collisions of the excited molecule with background atoms (predominantly rare gas atoms) relaxes the molecule into the v\u2032 = 0, 1 vibrational levels and emission occurs on the dipoleallowed B \u2192 X (ground) transition of the molecule. Despite the\u223c4\u201316 ns radiative lifetimes of the rare gas-halide excimer molecules, the efficiency of formation of the excimers in harpoon collisions (fluorescence efficiencies approaching 100% at low pressure) and the bandwidths of the UV emission are responsible for these molecular lasers being the most powerful ultraviolet lasers in existence. Commercially-available KrF lasers, for example, typically produce 1 J pulses in \u223c20 ns pulses which is equivalent to a peak power of 50 MW. If the pulse repetition frequency of the plasma is 100 Hz, then the average power of the laser is 100 W, and the duty cycle is 2 \u00d7 10\u22126. For the sake of comparison, the N2 laser available commercially in the late 1960s and 1970s was capable of generating energies of \u223c1 mJ in pulses of a few ns duration at\n14\n337 nm, which corresponds to peak pulse energies approaching 1 MW. Although attaining such peak power levels was a major accomplishment several decades ago, the rare gas-halide lasers increased peak and average power levels in the UV by an additional three\u2013four orders of magnitude and, consequently, have made possible deep-UV photolithography, medical procedures such as LASIK (with the ArF laser at 193 nm), and semiconductor device fabrication processes such as annealing of ion implantation damage. It must be emphasized that the efficiency of this laser family hinges on both the instantaneous population of the rare gas ns[3/2]1 excited states (where 3 \u2264 n \u2264 6) by electron impact in UV-preionized discharges and the collision which produces the excited, transient molecule. The efficiency of these coupled steps in the kinetic sequence is essential to the performance of this family of lasers and their overall efficiency and pulse energy, in particular.\nThe remainder of this section is devoted to the physics of the CO2 laser (10.6 \u03bcm), the most efficient and commerciallysuccessful of the gas discharge-pumped lasers, and arguably the most thoroughly studied of all plasma laser systems. Discovered in 1964 at Bell Laboratories by Patel [54, 55], the CO2 laser is perhaps the best example of the improvements in plasma photonic device performance to be gained through the synergy of electron impact excitation and heavyparticle chemistry in targeting the production of specific states. Figure 11 is a partial energy level diagram showing the molecular states relevant to this mid-IR laser. At left are the lowest vibrational quantum states associated with the bending, symmetric stretch, and asymmetric stretch modes of the CO2 molecule, and laser emission near 9.6 \u03bcm (\u223c1064 cm\u22121) results from transitions from the first quantum state associated with the asymmetric stretch mode (denoted 0001) to the second quantum state arising from the bending mode (0200). Lasing at the more common wavelength of 10.6 \u03bcm is the result of 0001 \u2192 1000 transitions. The original CO2 laser, based on a CW glow discharge in <1 Torr of CO2, produced a modest output power of \u223c1 mW. Within a year, however, Patel and colleagues [55] had succeeded in increasing the output power of this laser by five orders of magnitude (to 106 W) by exploiting the selectivity of excitation transfer. As illustrated by the right-hand portion of figure 11, the energy of the upper laser level (the 0001 vibrational state of CO2) is within 2 meV (18 cm\u22121 where 1 eV = 8065 cm\u22121) of that for the first excited vibrational state in the ground electronic state of N2. Consequently, these two states are said to be in resonance and the collisional transfer of energy from N2(v = 1) to the upper laser level is both rapid and efficient. In effect, one is again bypassing states of CO2 that intervene between the ground state of the molecule and the 0001 level.\nIn 1973, Lowke et al [56] showed that the efficiency of the CO2 laser could be optimized by varying E/N of the plasma generated in CO2:N2:He gas mixtures, and several of the highlights of their computational studies are summarized in figures 12 and 13. Figure 12 gives the electron impact crosssections for both elastic (momentum transfer) and inelastic processes relevant to the kinetic sequence of figure 11. Note that cross-sections for direct electron impact excitation of several of the CO2 vibrational states of figure 11 are included,\nas is the 0001 upper laser level. It is also evident that the 0001 cross-section peaks near 1 eV which corresponds with a dip in both the 0110 and (020 0 + 100 0) cross-sections. After calculating the EEDFs for CO2:N2:He mixtures, Lowke et al [56] were able to determine excitation rates for specific states and the partitioning of power, deposited in the plasma, into various processes or \u2018exit channels\u2019. Their results, shown in figure 13 as a function of E/N, demonstrate the ability to gain a degree of control over the collisional kinetics for pumping this laser. For E/N < 6 Td, for example, virtually all of the power deposited into the electron gas is lost to elastic collisions which appears as heat, whereas >80% of the input power to the plasma is delivered to excitation of the N2 and CO2(0001) vibrational levels when E/N reaches \u223c10 Td (10\u221216 V cm2). These calculations are widely viewed as one of the milestones in laser development because they demonstrate the ability to\n15\n\u2018tune\u2019 a key plasma parameter (E/N, in this case) for optimal efficiency.\nIn summary, a breakthrough in the design and performance of both lasers and lamps has occurred by placing less reliance on those atomic and molecular states most readily accessible to direct electron impact excitation. Electron impact remains the initial step in delivering power to the plasma but the focus has shifted to devising an efficient kinetic chain culminating in populating the terminal state(s). In the case of the CO2 and He\u2013Ne lasers, this collisional sequence comprises the transfer of energy from vibrationally-excited N2, or electronicallyexcited He, to the molecule or atom of interest, respectively. In the absence of this energy-transfermechanism, these plasma lasers perform poorly or not at all."

            "text": "Plasma plays important roles for EM waves as a light source as described in the previous sections, but it can also serve in another role as a propagation/manipulation medium for EM waves. This is attributed to collective motion of free electrons moving among atoms/molecules in a plasma which differs from photon emission arising from transitions of confined electrons inside atoms/molecules from higher- to lowerenergy levels.\nThe frequencies for EM-wave manipulation achieved by these plasma media in previous studies range from radiofrequency waves to millimeter waves [57], at most in the IR range [58] when we use a low-temperature plasma. Above the IR range, this role for EM waves caused by electron collective motion is mainly observed in metals, well known as bulk or\nsurface plasmons in solid-state physics [59]. However, highintensity plasma is also used for laser manipulation, and is referred to as a plasma mirror or plasma grating [60]. Thus, we stress that the concept of EM wave manipulation by plasma can be applicable in the visible-light range.\nHere we refer to plasma media with functional designs as plasma metamaterials [61], and we define this terminology in a wider sense for functional designs manipulated according to EM and optical physics, which is one of the very active areas in modern physics. To design and fabricate these materials, manipulation of a spatial plasma profile is a key factor, and the theoretical background for conceptual design is described in the following section. Regulation of EM waves is analogous to a crystal structure where bandgaps form, and is represented by achievements as plasma photonic crystals [57]. Here, since plasma has a different permittivity from the background media such as vacuum and dielectric, its array structure induces spatial periodicity of permittivity. We note that regular repetition with rigorously equal lattice length as in a crystal structure is required to form explicit wave bands. The fabrication of plasma shapes according to this conceptual design is also a difficult task due to spontaneous diffusion and instabilities in plasmas, but it has become achievable after recent microplasma developments [30, 62] in which a tiny plasma can be confined to less than 1 mm with a high electron density of more than 1019 m\u22123, which corresponds to a cutoff density around 28 GHz.\nBefore conceptually mixing with plasma media, photonic crystals and metamaterials have been extensively studied using the structural design of solid materials [63], in which one individual unit is smaller than the corresponding wavelength. Their functions are abundant and are described in various experimental and theoretical studies in the past two decades. Their design requires understanding of several new factors and are different from calculations of dispersion relations studied in conventional plasma physics, but they are basically solutions of Maxwell\u2019s equations, leading to the possibility that many Maxwell-equation solvers may be partially applicable. Therefore, we will focus here on a practical understanding of Maxwell\u2019s equations applied to photonic crystals and metamaterials.\nPhotonic crystals are periodic structures with a spatial periodic length close to the corresponding wavelength [59], and here we include them as a metamaterial in a broader sense of its definition. Since PPCs are periodic microplasma arrays, their spatial configurations are simpler than plasma metamaterials in which solid elements are mixed, leading to various proposals with experimental verification so far [57, 64\u201366]. PPCs aim at the design of a macroscopic dielectric constant that is abnormal with sufficient tunability by changing the plasma electron density, leading to verification of bandgaps in its initial study [64]. Although periodicity in one spatial dimension is unique, we find increasing variety as the number of dimensions increases to two or three, similar to the topological variation in solid-state crystals. Recently, new conceptual ideas such as a Bragg reflector are being proposed [57].\nMetamaterials also have spatial periodicity in general, but their individual unit is not simple as in a columnar plasma\n16\nbut more complex with mixed solid components to control permeability or other parameters for EM waves [61, 67\u201369], beyond the dielectric constant or permittivity. Interestingly, the functions of lower dimensions, i.e., in two-dimensional cases increase in comparison with progress in bulk metamaterials. For example, a metasurface in which its structure is planar has been extensively studied recently, with verification of polarization control and data encoding/encryption [70, 71]. The recent results on plasma metasurfaces also indicate novel possibilities such as wireless generation of microplasma arrays [72].\nWe also note that there are several other research topics related to plasma metamaterials, including plasma absorbers, plasma cloaks [73], and plasma antennas [74]. Such plasma devices for manipulation of EM waves are understandable by handling of Maxwell\u2019s equations and typical examples shown in the following, and their feasibility is not limited within what has been achieved so far.\nIn this section, firstly we review fundamentals of EM-wave propagation in these plasma media, starting from Maxwell\u2019s equations. Following this theoretical formulation, we discuss several examples of PPCs and metamaterials. Finally we mention the current status of this research topic and its future prospects."

            "text": "To show the theoretical basis of plasma metamaterials, we start the mathematical formulation, following reference [61]. Maxwell\u2019s equations, which describe propagation of EM waves in a given medium, are:\n\u2207\u00d7 H = \u2202D \u2202t , \u2207\u00d7 E = \u2212\u2202B \u2202t , (4)\nwhere H is the magnetic field, E the magnetic field, t the time, D = \u03b5\u03b50E, and B = \u03bc\u03bc0H with the dielectric constant (or permittivity) and permeability in vacuum \u03b50 and\u03bc0, respectively. The relative dielectric constant and the permeability, \u03b5 and \u03bc, are our main targets in parameter-design procedures for EM-wave manipulation.\nUsing the electric current density J, equation (4) becomes\n\u2207\u00d7 H = J + \u03b50 \u2202E \u2202t , \u2207\u00d7 E = \u2212\u03bc\u03bc0 \u2202H \u2202t . (5)\nHere, the motion of ions is neglected in comparison with electrons, and the current is defined as J = \u2212eneve, where e is the elementary charge, ne the electron density and ve the electron convective velocity. Combined with the momentum balance equation for electrons, we can deduce the well-known Drude-type dielectric constant as\n\u03b5 = 1 \u2212 e 2ne \u03b50me\u03c9(\u03c9 \u2212 j\u03bdm) = 1 \u2212 \u03c9pe 2 \u03c9(\u03c9 \u2212 j\u03bdm) , (6)\nwhere \u03c9pe is the electron plasma frequency, \u03bdm the electron elastic collision frequency, and we consider a Fourier component of A (= E or H) in equation (5) at\u03c9 as A exp( j(\u03c9t \u2212 k \u00b7 r)) with the wavenumber k and the position vector r. This form of the dielectric constant controls the tunability of plasma photonic crystals and plasma metamaterials by experimental\nsettings. Also, the external electric power used for plasma ionization controls ne, while gas pressure changes the collision frequency \u03bdm and, consequently, the attenuation of propagating waves.\nIn PPCs, spatial periodicity is essential in the theoretical formulation as well as in an experimental arrangements. To include this effect, we set the following periodic conditions on Maxwell equations, for instance, for E:\nE(r0 + a) = E(r0) exp(\u2212 jk \u00b7 a), (7)\nwhere r0 is the position vector at a given position, ai = na0i with i = x, y, or z in Cartesian coordinates, n is an integer and a0i is the spatial periodic length along the axis i. To obtain dispersion relations (or band diagrams) and local electric/magnetic profiles, this periodicity is both directly and indirectly applicable as a necessary and sufficient condition. We also note that this is frequently valid for two-dimensional metamaterials or metasurfaces, where the spatial periodicity induces extraordinary transmittance near the configurational cutoff frequencies; this is referred to as spoof surface plasmons [75].\nIn plasma metamaterials, parametric setting of \u03bc works frequently as another tunable factor in Maxwell\u2019s equations, although the concept of metamaterials is not limited to the insertion of abnormal-\u03bc elements but to all controllable spatial components affecting Maxwell\u2019s equations. The reason abnormal values of \u03bc such as those with negative sign are distinct in metamaterial research is that no other methods except such artificial designs have been successful in tuning of arbitrary values of \u03bc. A typical method for tuning \u03bc is using small isolated inductance\u2013capacitance (LC) resonance circuits [76], which influence \u03bc according to:\n\u03bc = F\u03c9m2\n\u03c9m2 \u2212 j\u03b3\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c92 , (8)\nwhere \u03c9m is the LC resonance frequency, and F and \u03b3 represent the effective amplitude and attenuation factors of the LC resonance circuit over the corresponding spatial unit. Note that such LC resonance circuits are composed of metallic components, which are factors arising from elements outside the plasma. Interestingly, we stress that synthesis of plasma and such designed metallic microstructures is quite unique through the following expression of refractive index N:\nN = \u221a \u03b5 \u221a \u03bc, (9)\nwhere \u03b5 depends on ne and \u03bc is manipulated by the metallic elements. When both of them have a negative sign, N becomes negative, which is quite easily achievable in this hybrid composite in a tunable style. The corresponding wave frequency is at or below microwave frequencies for typical low-pressure plasmas, and can be increased to millimeter waves and terahertz waves in microplasmas whose characteristic length is below 1 cm [30, 62]."

            "text": "5.3.1. Plasma photonic crystals: the pioneering stage. Historically the plasma in the ionospheric layer operates as a\n17\nreflector of radio communications which enables us to enjoy radio broadcasts, even those that originate from the opposite side of the earth. Analogously, plasma designed and created artificially was proposed to operate as a reflector and an absorber of EM waves [77, 78]. Following these proposals, several experimental and theoretical studies revealed that manipulation of the spatial arrangement of a plasma in a periodic pattern, leads to more complicated dispersion relations in the \u03c9\u2013k space, or more specifically and functionally, in band diagrams.\nIn the initial experimental and theoretical study, although its authors did not clearly point out its significance, a bandgap structure was clearly predicted; Faith et al described frequency up-shift by a rapidly-created periodic plasma, and they derived a one-dimensional band diagram with bandgaps in a plasma array [79]. Just after this report, Kalluri published a complete theoretical view of functional plasma design which includes details of the theoretical background of EM wave propagation in a spatially periodic plasma and in a rapidly-growing plasma [80]. This work includes almost all aspects of plasma media for EM waves, where the media are composed only of plasma, without any other components except dielectric layers located around it.\nFollowing that paper, a theoretical work by Hojo et al demonstrated the concept of plasma photonic crystals, where one-dimensional spatial periodic plasmas exhibit band diagrams which contains propagating and forbidden bands that are controllable by changing the ratios of thickness in plasma and vacuum (or dielectric) layers [81]. Almost simultaneously, the lowest frequency bandgap in two-dimensional plasma photonic crystals was observed experimentally in the millimeter range (\u223c60 GHz) [64]. In the reports that follow these two studies, the formulation for and numerical derivation of band diagrams in two-dimensional plasmas were completed after a theoretical transformation from the plane-wave expansion method developed for metallic photonic crystals in the visible-light range [59].\nBandgaps, which emerge in electronic states in a lattice of a solid crystal, are the most popular signs to detect spatial regular periodicity. Although two- or three-dimensional lattices yield more sophisticated band diagrams, here we take a closer look at the case of a one-dimensional lattice.\nFigure 14 shows the dispersion relation or the \u03c9\u2013k diagram with the first Brillouin zone in a one-dimensional plasma\u2013vacuum periodic structure, in comparison with the dispersion relation in an infinite plasma. Since \u03b5 in a plasma is less than 1, its difference to that in vacuum creates a bandgap, and the dispersion curves bend on its edge. There are several comprehensions of the emerging mechanism of bandgaps in a periodic plasma, and one of them [82] is illustrated in figure 15. At the lowest bandgap, the spatial repetitive period is equal to half of the wavelength or one peak-to-peak length of the electric field profile in the standing wave composed of forward and backward waves. In the vicinity of the band gap, we find two patterns of standing waves as illustrated in figure 15. In one case, the peaks in the profile of the field strength matches the centre of the gap, whereas they are in the plasma region in the other case. These two patterns correspond to the higher\nand lower possible frequencies when k = \u03c0/a0i, and, as we discuss below, we can understand the reason why for these two distinctive profiles at the same value of k in the band diagram. In plasma, the wavelength of EM waves at a given frequency becomes longer than in vacuum. In other words, to keep the same wavelength at a fixed value of k, the frequency is higher when the wave interacts with a plasma. An advanced and more rigorous analysis [82] showed the details of field profiles slightly separated from the standing wave. The wave energy stored in the overall space, which is as a function of \u03b5, \u03bc and specific E or B fields, is larger when the fields are concentrated in plasma, leading to the allocation on the higher frequency band.\n18\n5.3.2. Plasma photonic crystals: current progress. Photonic crystals are artificial materials in which the refractive index is varied in a periodic fashion along at least one spatial coordinate. One of the earliest examples of a photonic crystal is the multilayer dielectric mirror comprising a series (\u2018stack\u2019) of dielectric films, each a quarter wavelength in thickness, in which the refractive index alternates with each successive layer between a low and high value. The most common mirror design, for example, consists of alternating TiO2 and SiO2 thin films with refractive indices of 1.48 and 1.99 (at 550 nm), respectively. As discussed earlier, PPCs incorporate low temperature plasma as one of the elements in the design of the crystal. Integrating plasma into photonic crystals is attractive for several reasons, the foremost of which is the inherent dynamic nature of plasma. Because both the real and imaginary parts of the plasma dielectric permittivity (\u03b5p) are dependent upon the electron density ne, varying the amplitude and phase of the permittivity by modulating E/N of the plasma within the crystal is straightforward. This capability stands in contrast to conventional photonic crystals whose EM properties are static, fixed by their constituent materials and the crystal geometry. Plasma elements in photonic crystals allow for the EM characteristics of a crystal to be transformed, or entirely different crystals to be created, at electronic speeds. The geometry of the structure defines the wavelength region in which the PPC is active and the plasma elements, in concert with other materials in the crystal, determine its frequency response. In short, the properties of PPCs are \u2018tunable\u2019, whereas those for conventional photonic crystals generally are not. Combining plasma elements with a dielectric/metal structure periodic in one\u2013three dimensions offers the unique ability to control \u03b5p in real-time. Recently, 2D and 3D PPCs operating in the 100\u2013500 GHz frequency (mm/sub-mm wave) range have been reported [57], and figure 16 is a series of photographs of crystals fabricated in a polymer (polydimethylsiloxane: PDMS) and having a lattice constant (a) of 1.0 mm which corresponds to a Bragg frequency of 150 GHz. The fabrication process developed at the University of Illinois to construct 3D dielectric scaffolds of almost arbitrary geometry enables 2D and 3D PPCs to be generated. Although not shown in figure 16(f), an electrode is inserted into opposite ends of each of the channels formed in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) scaffold. Columnar microplasmas 0.355 mm in diameter are produced in a rare gas (typically Ar) by driving the electrode network with a sinusoidal or bipolar voltage waveform having a peak value <7 kV. The geometric structure of the crystals shown in figure 16 is known as a \u2018woodpile\u2019 configuration in which the columns in each layer of the crystal are parallel to one another, and spaced by 1.0 mm. Furthermore, the columns in each successive layer of the crystal are rotated by 90\u25e6 with respect to those in the preceding layer so as to have a periodicity of 2.0 mm along the longitudinal coordinate. For illustrative purposes, the crystals of figure 16(a) are shown as consisting entirely of plasma microcolumns. However, the crystal structure is defined by 355 \u03bcm diameter, cylindrical microchannels produced by microfabrication processes within a PDMS block (such as that in figure 16(f)) and these channels can be filled with plasma but, alternatively, with metals and/or dielectrics so\n19\nas to yield PPCs whose EM properties are controlled by only a few plasma columns.\nAlthough this technology is in its infancy, the transmission spectra of such PPCs in the mm/sub-mm wavelength spectral region has yielded data that indicate their potential for several applications. Figure 17, for example, shows transmission spectra for one of the microplasma/dielectric/metal PPCs described in [57]. As shown by the inset drawings in figures 17(a) and (b), the crystal consists of eight layers and probe radiation is incident on the PPC from the left. The last layer of the crystal (at far right) is an array of equally spaced, and vertically oriented, metal microcolumns. The red and blue curves in figure 17 represent data recorded with plasma generated in the odd-numbered layers (beginning at left and horizontally-oriented), or no plasma present, respectively. The spectra of panels (a) and (b) show the presence of two strong resonances observed in the vicinity of 132 and 138 GHz, and figures 17(c) and (d) provide an expanded view of the abrupt changes in both amplitude (upper curves) and phase (lower) that occur near both resonances. Although the data of\n20\nfigure 17 are time-integrated (i.e., not temporally resolved), the spectral dependence of both the amplitude and phase data demonstrate that the resonances can be shifted, and the phase behaviour thoroughly altered, by the presence of microplasma columns in layers 1, 3, 5, and 7. It is apparent that the ability to vary the electron density and the collision frequency for momentum transfer (through the identity and pressure of the background gas) makes PPCs well-suited for applications including 100\u2013500 GHz communications and environmental sensors.\n5.3.3. Plasma metamaterials. Plasma metamaterials cover a wide range of spatial configurations of designed plasma structures that are decorated with other material parts [61]. In a broader sense, PPCs can be categorized as plasma metamaterials; all plasma metamaterials are designed to manipulate EM waves. Insertion of metallic resonators with series LC closedcircuit coupling makes \u03bc negative in a narrow-frequency band just above the resonance frequency. Figure 18 demonstrates overdense-plasma generation in a metamaterial-installed space when high-power microwaves at 2.45 GHz, which was in the negative-\u03bc band, were launched in a regular waveguide at low pressure [83]. Here, a negative-\u03bc state is overlapped with a negative-\u03b5 plasma, which is the so-called double negative system or a negative-N material.\nHigh-power microwave injection at a frequency near the resonance is not the only way to create a negative-N state, and some experimental studies were able to produce a negative-N plasma metamaterial in which signal detection of low-power microwave transmittance was observed while the plasma was generated by other electric power sources [68, 69]. When highpower microwaves were used, a parameter transition into the negative-\u03b5high-ne plasma took place, predicted in a theoretical nonlinear model. Observation of such dynamic systems with\nhysteresis is one of the significant points of plasma metamaterials with complete tunability for \u03b5, which is not easily achieved using conventional metamaterials composed of solidstate materials and is applicable for high-power microwave switches.\n5.3.4. Other examples and future prospects. After these initial successes in scientific results, our current focus is on a variety of possible routes for near-future developments of PPCs and plasma metamaterials. Since they both have a flexible property in time in addition to the spatial degree of freedom that conventional metamaterial possess, they provide a wideranged scope for device design, which can be different from the previous reports listed here. First, the spatiotemporal tunability which are described above, may be applicable to future devices. For instance, they are suitable for encoding/decoding and encryption of digital information data [70, 71].\nAs described in this section, a high-power property above 10 W and a high-frequency function over 100 GHz are clear advantages over current market-available solid-state devices. For high-power microwave applications, where wireless power transmission [84] is a promising market for future energy management systems, solid-state devices cannot work due to the limitations of the solid materials. When we survey potentials in high-frequency cases, which are a feasible wireless communication carriers decades in the future, technological breakthroughs will be required if we aim for solid-state-based device design and fabrication. Scientific applicability and future market demands to control schemes in these microwave systems make it possible to use plasma devices with a variety of functions such as a filter, a phase shifter, or attenuator as described in this section.\nIn plasma metamaterials, a loss term caused by the Drudetype permittivity may be a drawback when \u03b5 is near or below zero, in addition to inevitable attenuation in the Lorentziantype \u03bc that is also included in solid-material metamaterials. However, this loss term can add a new function to plasma photonic crystals and metamaterials; an absorber or an attenuator is one of the fundamental devices for EM waves, and its designable inclusion in metamaterials, controlled by the working gas pressure, is one advantage over solid-state metamaterials; deletion and/or veiling of information signals is important in many cases.\nFinally, we should note that advanced technologies which are now being developed can merge within this new scientific category of low-temperature plasmas. For instance, a PPC based on DBDs is a good example that we can follow [67]. As discussed above, two- and three-dimensional photonic crystals are spatially arranged along with discharge electrode patterns or elaborately-fabricated capillary arrays. Meanwhile, as we can learn from the previous studies, self-organized patterns are visible in DBD possibly due to underlying two-component reaction\u2013diffusion processes. A similar story is found in the proposal of a THz-range plasma photonic crystal based on Coulomb crystallization of microparticles in dusty plasmas [85]. In parallel to progress in scientific understandings of such novel phenomena, we are encouraged to make use of their results as scientific tools.\n21"

            "text": "Plasma photonics has a long and distinguished history which includes the fluorescent lamp, the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for the lighting industry for more than a half-century, and metal and multihalide arc lamps that illuminate the avenues and expressways of virtually all of the world\u2019s largest cities to this day. Indeed, plasmas offer the widest range of emission wavelengths available from any medium\u2014extending from radio frequencies through the soft x-ray spectral region. For traditional, nonthermal plasma lamps, the physics is dominated by electronimpact excitation and ionization rates which strongly favours light sources based on emission from low-lying excited states of atoms and small molecules.\nThe advent of microplasma lamps has shifted the focus of new light source development dramatically. While electron impact processes remain necessary for coupling power into the plasma, the role of plasma chemistry looms larger in lamp design because of the operating pressures and gas and electron temperature characteristics of microcavity plasmas. In such high pressure, cold plasmas, the relative populations of excited states are no longer determined solely by the gas and electron temperatures. Rather, heavy-particle collisional chemistry assumes a commanding position in designing efficient radiators. The recent development of a family of lamps emitting efficiently at one of several wavelengths in the 150\u2013350 nm region of the UV and VUV spectrum presents the possibility of driving several commercially-important chemical processes by short wavelength photochemistry, relying on photons rather than electron impact or temperature to rupture chemical bonds.\nThe electron number densities provided by microplasmas, and the ease with which ne can be varied in time, are a boon to plasma-based, dynamic EM devices. Since the amplitude and phase of the dielectric permittivity are dependent on the electron density, the phase of incident radiation can be manipulated by both plasma metamaterials and photonic crystals. The versatility and robust nature of plasmas suggest that new functionality and applications will be forthcoming from this unique and artificial EM \u2018material\u2019.\nData availability statement\nNo new data were created or analysed in this study.\nORCID iDs\nSander Nijdam https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1310-6942 Kavita V Desai https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4666-0584 Sung-Jin Park https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9260-0091 J Gary Eden https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3470-9793"
