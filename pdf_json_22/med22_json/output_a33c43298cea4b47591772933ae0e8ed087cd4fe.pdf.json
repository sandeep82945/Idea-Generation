    "abstractText": "Stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) is a widespread and deadly disease that affects nearly half of Caribbean coral species. To understand the microbial community response to this disease, we performed a disease transmission experiment on US Virgin Island (USVI) corals, exposing six species of coral with varying susceptibility to SCTLD. The microbial community of the surface mucus and tissue layers were examined separately using a small subunit ribosomal RNA gene-based sequencing approach, and data were analyzed to identify microbial community shifts following disease acquisition, potential causative pathogens, as well as compare microbiota composition to field-based corals from the USVI and Florida outbreaks. While all species displayed similar microbiome composition with disease acquisition, microbiome similarity patterns differed by both species and mucus or tissue microhabitat. Further, disease exposed but not lesioned corals harbored a mucus microbial community similar to those showing disease signs, suggesting that mucus may serve as an early warning detection for the onset of SCTLD. Like other SCTLD studies in Florida, Rhodobacteraceae, Arcobacteraceae, Desulfovibrionaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Fusibacter, Marinifilaceae, and Vibrionaceae dominated diseased corals. This study demonstrates the differential response of the mucus and tissue microorganisms to SCTLD and suggests that mucus microorganisms may be diagnostic for early disease exposure.",

To understand the microbial community response to this disease, we performed a disease transmission experiment on US Virgin Island (USVI) corals, exposing six species of coral with varying susceptibility to SCTLD. The microbial community of the surface mucus and tissue layers were examined separately using a small subunit ribosomal RNA gene-based sequencing approach, and data were analyzed to identify microbial community shifts following disease acquisition, potential causative pathogens, as well as compare microbiota composition to field-based corals from the USVI and Florida outbreaks. While all species displayed similar microbiome composition with disease acquisition, microbiome similarity patterns differed by both species and mucus or tissue microhabitat. Further, disease exposed but not lesioned corals harbored a mucus microbial community similar to those showing disease signs, suggesting that mucus may serve as an early warning detection for the onset of SCTLD. Like other SCTLD studies in Florida, Rhodobacteraceae, Arcobacteraceae, Desulfovibrionaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Fusibacter, Marinifilaceae, and Vibrionaceae dominated diseased corals. This study demonstrates the differential response of the mucus and tissue microorganisms to SCTLD and suggests that mucus microorganisms may be diagnostic for early disease exposure.\nISME Communications; https://doi.org/10.1038/s43705-022-00126-3"

            "text": "Marine diseases are growing in magnitude and severity causing economic and biodiversity impacts on marine ecosystems [1\u20135]. Historically the role of individual microorganisms as causative agents has been the focus of marine disease studies, but it is increasingly recognized that microbiomes, assemblages of associated microorganisms, play a critical role in organismal health and immune function [6]. The tendency for microbial communities to remain stable when exposed to stressors, or undergo dysbiosis, the breakdown of microstructure and diversity, are emerging as important elements of stress and disease responses. In the marine environment, specific diseases generally affect one species, and it is rare that similar disease signs are exhibited across diverse species [7, 8]. However, host fidelity appears less restrictive within diseases of scleractinian corals. Stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) affects phylogenetically diverse Caribbean corals (>22 species) with distinct morphologies and growth rates [9]. Examining microbiome stability and dysbiosis associated with the onset of disease signs within a multi-species experimental framework provides an opportunity to uncover\nthe characteristics of microorganisms or communities that may be involved in maintaining disease resilience. Despite the toll SCTLD is having on Caribbean coral reefs [10\u201314], little is known about the microbial contributions to this disease. The diversity, species specificity, and variability of coralmicrobial associations all contribute to the challenges of identifying a disease pathogen. Antibiotic treatment has been shown to halt progression of SCTLD, suggesting a bacterial origin [15, 16]. Spatial epidemiological models of disease spread have suggested that the pathogen(s) may be waterborne [17, 18]. Recently, evidence suggests that a virus may be associated with the disease [19, 20]. While there have been some bacterial taxa correlated with the disease in field-based surveys [21\u201323], no etiological agent(s) have been identified and no transmission studies have specifically examined coral microbiomes during SCTLD onset. Further, why some coral species are susceptible to SCTLD while others are not remains unclear but may be due to species-specific traits such as differential host gene expression, or symbiont (e.g., dinoflagellate endosymbionts of corals in the family Symbiodiniaceae) and microbiome characteristics, which ultimately affect the innate host immune function. Understanding SCTLD-associated microbiome\nReceived: 25 January 2022 Revised: 29 March 2022 Accepted: 6 April 2022\n1Center for Marine and Environmental Studies, University of the Virgin Islands, St. Thomas, USVI, USA. 2Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA, USA. 3MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography/Applied Ocean Science and Engineering, Cambridge and Woods Hole, MA, USA. 4Department of Biosciences, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. 5Department of Oceanography and Coastal Science, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA. 6Mote Marine Laboratory, Sarasota, FL, USA. 7Department of Biology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA. \u2709email: aapprill@whoi.edu\nwww.nature.com/ismecomms\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () ;,:\ndynamics in a species-specific, as well as coral microhabitat (mucus or tissue) framework is necessary to address this question. Previous studies have found that coral \u201cmicrohabitats\u201d (e.g., mucus, tissue, skeleton) have distinct microbial communities [24, 25]. Further, differentiation between these microhabitats allows for a more targeted understanding of microbial dynamics upon disease acquisition. Mucus layers are found in a vast variety of organisms, from humans to cnidarians, yet the function of this layer is similar among species, in providing a protective barrier between the organism and the external environment. Mucus microbial communities tend to be influenced by both environmental and host factors [25], playing an important role in coral immunity as a physical barrier that traps and immobilizes pathogens [26]. Furthermore, this layer is inhabited by beneficial microbes that exclude pathogens from penetrating the mucus layer and thus infecting the coral tissue through both competition and the secretion of antibiotic substances [27, 28]. The microbes intimately associated with coral tissue (exclusive of mucus or skeleton) are less studied. Coral tissue is composed of three layers: epidermis, gastrodermis, and mesoglea, with Symbiodiniaceae symbionts located in the gastrodermis and microbial aggregates identified within epidermal and gastrodermal tissues of healthy corals [29, 30]. Histological evidence from Landsberg et al. [31] suggests that SCTLD first affects the Symbiodiniaceae, with lesions originating in the gastrodermis. Thus, focusing on identifying tissue-associated microbes may provide more specific information about potential causative agents or perhaps secondary or opportunistic pathogens responding to tissue sloughing. Advances in human microbiome studies have shown that many stressors and disease result in microbial dysbiosis -- a shift to a microbial community that is detrimental to the organism\u2019s health [32, 33]. This shift in the microbiome from mutualistic to dysbiotic can be seen as a reduction in beneficial microbes, an increase in pathogenic microbes, and both reductions and increases in microbial diversity [34\u201337]. For coral diseases, few have an identified etiological agent, and it is unclear if disease is caused by a single pathogen or rather a shift that occurs in the microbial community. This shift to a dysbiotic community may reduce the efficacy of the microbes in the mucus layer to protect the host and also may reduce the host\u2019s ability to fight infection [33, 36] and may be seen as an increase in pathogens present in both the mucus and tissue. In a disease transmission study by Macknight et al. [33] the microbial community of white plague disease infected coral holobiont samples converged to a community with reduced microbial diversity that was dominated by pathogens. Further, the changes to the microbiome followed a species susceptibility pattern. To understand coral mucus and tissue microbiome dysbiosis upon exposure to SCTLD, we conducted a laboratory-based\ntransmission study with six coral species that vary in terms of their disease susceptibility, reported lesion progression rates in the field [38], and their representation of phylogenetic and ecological diversity. We hypothesized that both the mucus and tissue microbiomes of diseased corals would significantly differ from that of healthy colonies, and that diseased mucus and tissue would show different microbiome disease signatures. Further, we hypothesized that, upon disease acquisition, the most susceptible species would show greater microbial community similarities among affected colonies compared to the least susceptible coral species."

Portions of this study, including disease prevalence and incidence, relative risk of lesion development, and lesion progression rates were previously reported in Meiling et al. [39]. Apparently healthy coral colonies were collected from Ruperts Rock, St Thomas, USVI (18\u00b0 19\u2032 39.6\u2033 N 64\u00b0 55\u2032 33.5\u2033 W) on 03/22 and 03/26/2019 following a roving survey of the site, which was conducted immediately prior to the collection to ensure that the site was free of SCTLD. Apparently healthy colonies that were approximately 25 cm \u00d7 25 cm (n= 8) of each of the six species (Fig. 1) were collected and transported in individual ziplock bags placed in a cooler to the University of the Virgin Islands Center for Marine and Environmental Studies to be used as \u2018treatment\u2019 colonies.

The disease-free apparently healthy central colonies were collected from the same site as the experimental treatment colonies (Ruperts Rock) by one team of divers and were used for the \u2018control\u2019 treatments. To avoid contamination, a separate boat and dive team collected colonies of D. labyrinthiformis with active disease from the purported initial disease outbreak location, Flat Cay, St Thomas (18\u00b0 19\u2032 02.9\u2033 N 64\u00b0 59\u2032 27.0\u2033 W).

Throughout the experiment, all central diseased colonies showed active lesion expansion and no central apparently healthy colonies exhibited lesion development. Each apparently healthy colony was separated into two fragments prior to one-week acclimation to allow for a fragment of each genet to be exposed to a coral colony showing signs of SCTLD and an apparently healthy control colony. Upon commencement of the transmission experiment on 04/04/2019, one half of the treatment fragment belonging to each species was arranged at equal distances around an actively diseased D. labyrinthiformis (treatment n= 8), while the other half of the treatment fragment was placed in a separate 26 l tank arranged in a similar manner except the central D. labyrinthiformis was an apparently healthy coral (control n= 8) (Fig. 1, modeled after Williams et al.

Tanks were placed among three outdoor, shaded seawater tables with chilled running seawater to maintain a constant temperature. Each tank was equipped with an individual air stone, 100% of water was changed daily, and tanks were randomly redistributed across the seawater tables daily. Disease treatment fragments that developed lesions were monitored for at least 12 h to confirm that had an actively expanding lesion indicative of SCTLD. Corals with active lesions were removed from the experimental tank along with the corresponding genet fragment from the paired control tank. Corals were briefly removed from the water long enough to collect mucus using sterile cotton flocked swabs (Hydraflock, Puritan, Guilford ME, USA) and an approximately 8 cm2 colony fragment was collected at the lesion using a hammer and chisel for tissue microbiome analysis. The experiment was ended after 10 days and treatment corals that did not develop disease were removed from the experiment and sampled along with their corresponding control fragment. The swabs were placed in a cryovial and coral fragments (tissue+ skeleton) were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for later molecular analysis.\nComparative field samples To allow for comparison to tank samples, diseased coral fragments of Orbicella annularis and Pseudodiploria strigosa (n= 4) were collected in the field on 04/07/2019 from the same site as diseased experimental corals (Flat Cay). Approximately 2 cm2 coral fragments were collected by SCUBA using a hammer and chisel and brought to the surface in a whirl-pak bag filled with seawater and swabbed along the lesion for mucus (field mucus). The fragments (field tissue) were then transported in a cooler back to UVI and both field mucus and field tissue were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.

A 10ml non-Luer lock syringe was used to scrape the coral surface while simultaneously aspirating the resulting dislodged coral mucus and tissue. Colonies without lesions (control mucus+tissue slurry) were sampled along with colonies with lesions at the lesion boundary (diseased mucus+tissue slurry).

In contrast, diseased tissue microbiomes showed differential species responses that followed species disease susceptibility. Microbiome similarity patterns among colonies also differed between the mucus and tissue compartments upon contracting the disease, which could relate to differences in the role of the mucus and tissue microorganisms in SCTLD.

            "text": "Here we observed a significant shift in the diseased mucus microbial community of all species compared to apparently healthy controls, along with a community composition that changed to a less similar make up (except for S. siderea). No other study has examined mucus microbiomes separately from tissue in SCTLD affected corals and doing so allowed us to uncover opposing patterns in mucus and tissue microbiome similarity. The most susceptible coral species showed the smallest divergence in the mucus microbiome, which suggests that dysbiosis is occurring in this mucus layer and may be affecting the immune function provided by coral mucus, and that the most susceptible species are the most sensitive to loss of this protection offered by the mucus. Our experiment showed novel trends in the mucus microbiomes of some SCTLD exposed (without lesion) colonies. Three species, P. strigosa, M. cavernosa and P. astreoides, showed significant differences in the mucus microbiomes of SCTLD exposed colonies, compared to controls, while S. siderea did not. While our observations bring up an interesting idea that the mucus microbiome could serve as an early diagnostic indicator of SCTLD exposure, more time-series type research is needed on susceptible colonies to conclude whether these genets were resistant to SCTLD, or in the early transitional period before lesion development. For future work, it would be informative to pair mucus sampling with histological investigations, to determine if\nthe mucus microbiomes coincide with any of the observed histological changes in the coral tissue [39].\nSCTLD tissue microbiome alterations followed disease susceptibility patterns In this study, the tissue microbiotas of the SCTLD lesioned colonies converged on a general disease signature (Fig. 2, NMDS). Half of the species, P. strigosa, O. annularis and C. natans, showed significant differences in their tissue microbiotas between lesioned and control colonies. These three species also showed increased similarity in the tissue microbiomes in the lesioned compared to control colonies. These results suggest that the associated microbes may be causative or highly reflective of the disease state in P. strigosa, O. annularis and C. natans. In contrast, P. astreoides, S. siderea and M. cavernosa lesioned tissue microbiomes were not significantly different than controls. These microbiome similarity patterns are reflective of SCTLD susceptibility patterns. Based on results from Meiling et al. [39] and in corroboration with the SCTLD case definition from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection [9, 53], the two most susceptible species in this study were P. strigosa and C. natans. Interestingly, these two species had the greatest percent change (300 and 212% respectively, Fig. 4) in the tissue microbial community with disease. The intermediately susceptible species included M. cavernosa (29%) and O. annularis (21%), which had a more moderate convergence in the tissue microbiomes compared to the two highly susceptible species. S. siderea is also an intermediately susceptible species, however, we found a slight divergence in the tissue microbiome. One caveat to consider is that there is uncertainty about whether or not S. siderea in fact contracts SCTLD based on differences in lesion morphology and progression [53]. However, based on the rapid lesion progression rates as well as no control colonies becoming diseased, we believe that S. siderea did in fact contract SCTLD in this study, and this species-specific microbial response may partly explain why the lesions are so different (Supplementary Fig. 4). P. astreoides is considered a rarely susceptible species, but in this study, over half of the treatment colonies developed lesions by the end of the experiment. Notably the tissue microbial community behaved differently compared with the other species, diverging to a less similar community with disease. The high rates of infection in this study may be due to high pathogen loads within an enclosed system. Healthy P. astreoides tissue and mucus microbiomes in this study were highly similar (>65% among\nISME Communications\ncolonies, Supplementary Figure 5) and enriched with Endozoicomonas (Supplementary Table 2), which were lost upon lesion acquisition. Additional research is needed to understand why P. astreoides is more susceptible to SCTLD transmission in a lab setting, and if Endozoicomonas, prominent symbionts of P. astreoides [24, 54] provide protection against SCTLD in the field. Conceptually, our results demonstrating microbiome change alongside coral health alterations align with the idea that the mucus microbiome serves as a primary immune response system for corals [26, 55]. Further, by showing microbiome divergence between colonies of each species (except S. siderea), our results suggest that there are likely several factors influencing SCTLD mucus microbiomes. For example, the alterations in the mucus microbiomes upon lesion development likely reflect primary and/ or secondary infections, as well as potential reductions in beneficial microbes that contribute to host immune protection. The mucus and tissue microbial responses considered together suggest the microbiome responses among species are tied to species susceptibility, with the most susceptible species having the least dramatic divergence in the mucus microbiome and the most dramatic convergence to a very similar disease community, and the least susceptible species having a less similar tissue microbiome. This suggests that the shift to a dysbiotic community in the mucus microbiome results in a loss of the protective functions of the mucus and allows the tissue microbial community to become dominated by pathogens."

Uncovering exact sequence matches across time and geographically disparate locations that were present, even if not identified as statistically more abundant, in all species and sample types suggests an important role that these ASVs are likely playing in this disease. However, it is unclear if these bacteria are causative agents, secondary pathogens, or associated with some part of the tissue breakdown process. Rhodobacteraceae were the most common Family of bacteria enriched in disease mucus and tissue samples (12 total, Table 2) and are common associates of both healthy and diseased corals. Some Rhodobacteraceae metabolize dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and it is possible that they are attracted to this or other osmolytes released during the tissue sloughing. The genus Nautella includes Nautella italica R11, a pathogen that causes bleaching of red macroalgae, by secreting compounds that inhibit\nISME Communications\nphotosynthesis and that aid in algal cell wall penetration [56, 57]. Additionally, genomics studies have found that Vibrio have several virulence associated genes, allowing them to deploy many different tools to attack coral and their algal symbionts, such as\ntoxins that cause photoinactivation in Symbiodiniaceae and tissue damage to the coral [58]. These bacteria warrant further investigation when considered alongside results from Landsberg et al. [31] which suggest that SCTLD first affects the coral\u2019s algal\nISME Communications\nendosymbiont, Symbiodiniaceae, and is a result of toxicosis. Arcobacter was only found to be enriched in disease mucus samples but not tissue. Arcobacter are found in various coral diseases globally which may point to its potential as an opportunistic bacterium (Supplementary Table 3). Desulfovibrionaceae thrive in anoxic, sulfide-rich environments and are a key secondary pathogen in the polymicrobial Black Band Disease, where its role as a sulfate-reducing bacteria results in sulfide production causing coral tissue death [59, 60]. Similarly, this bacterium may be acting as a secondary pathogen in SCTLD infected corals. Peptostreptococcaceae and Fusibacter are both anaerobic bacteria, and Marinifilaceae are facultatively anaerobic, further supporting that there is a reduction in the oxygen availability at the disease lesion. Histopathological and transmission electron microscopy has provided evidence that SCTLD is a result of toxicosis [31] or viral infection [19]. In the context of our microbial data, we are unable to determine if the bacteria identified are causing the disease or are opportunistic to the altered lesion conditions."

            "text": "The present study is the first to examine diseased coral and tissue microbiome samples separately, and the first disease transmission experiment conducted on stony coral tissue loss disease infected corals from the US Virgin Islands. This approach allowed us to control for variation in the microbial community in response to environmental changes, and also to make comparisons between the same coral individuals in a control and disease state for six coral species. A similar response to SCTLD infection\u2013 a shift to a more dissimilar microbial community \u2013 was seen in coral mucus when corals became infected suggesting that the disease is causing dysbiosis in the mucus layer, potentially impacting the immune function. In contrast, we found a species-specific response in the tissue community that is reflective of SCTLD susceptibility patterns, with the most susceptible corals having the greatest shift, converging to a highly similar microbial community within diseased coral tissue. A strength of the current study was the separate investigation of the mucus and tissue microhabitats, and we suggest future studies continue to focus on these communities separately to gain a clearer picture of the changes occurring in the coral microbiome."
