Investigation of the Mechanism of CO2 Capture in APILs: Further studies could delve into the detailed mechanism of CO2 capture in ammonium-based protic ionic liquids (APILs), focusing on understanding the physicochemical interactions between CO2 molecules and APILs. This research could involve computational modeling to predict how modifications to the APIL structure might enhance CO2 capture efficiency.

Development of Next-Generation APILs for Enhanced CO2 Separation: Building on the findings that tributylammonium heptanoate [TBA][C7] demonstrated the highest CO2 absorption capacity, future research could focus on synthesizing new APILs with altered cationic and anionic components. These modifications could aim to increase CO2 solubility, selectivity, and the overall efficiency of the separation process, potentially leading to the development of more effective APILs for industrial applications.

Scalability and Industrial Application of APILs for CO2 Removal: Given the promising results of APILs in CO2 absorption, further studies could explore the scalability of using APILs in large-scale CO2 removal processes, such as in natural gas purification or carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems. This research could evaluate the practical challenges, such as the cost of synthesis, the thermal and chemical stability of APILs in industrial settings, and the environmental impact of their widespread use.

Recyclability and Sustainability of APILs: Building on the preliminary recyclability study mentioned in the paper, future research could explore more efficient and less energy-intensive methods for regenerating APILs after CO2 capture. Studies could also assess the long-term stability and sustainability of APILs, including their biodegradability and potential toxicity, to ensure their environmental compatibility.

Hybrid Systems Combining APILs with Other Technologies: Investigating the integration of APILs with other CO2 separation technologies, such as membrane separation or adsorption processes, could be a fruitful area of research. Such hybrid systems might leverage the unique properties of APILs to overcome the limitations of existing technologies, potentially leading to more efficient and cost-effective solutions for CO2 removal.
