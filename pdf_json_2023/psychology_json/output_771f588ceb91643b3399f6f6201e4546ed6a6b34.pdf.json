The chemical characterization of planet-forming disks is a crucial step in our understanding of the diversity and habitability of exoplanets. Very low-mass stars (< 0.2 M ) are interesting targets because they host a rich population of terrestrial planets. Here we present the JWST detection of abundant hydrocarbons in the disk of a very low-mass star obtained as part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS). In addition to very strong and broad emission from C2H2 and its CCH2 isotopologue, C4H2, benzene, and possibly CH4 are identified, but water, PAH and silicate features are weak or absent. The lack of small silicate grains implies that we can look deep down into this disk. These detections testify to an active warm hydrocarbon chemistry with a high C/O ratio in the inner 0.1 au of this disk, perhaps due to destruction of carbonaceous grains. The exceptionally high C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/H2O column density ratios suggest that oxygen is locked up in icy pebbles and planetesimals outside the water iceline. This, in turn, will have significant consequences for the composition of forming exoplanets. M dwarfs are the most common stars in the Galaxy and are known to host exoplanets in abundance1, 2. However, the terrestrial planet-forming zones of the disks around M dwarfs have been largely inaccessible with previous observations due to limited spatial and spectral resolution and the dim nature of these objects. The source 2MASS-J16053215-1933159 (hereafter denoted as J160532) is a member of the \u223c3\u201311 Myr old Upper Scorpius star forming region at a distance of 152\u00b11 pc3, with an age of 2.6\u00b11.6 Myr4. Its spectral type of M4.75 points to a very low-mass young star (M\u2217=0.14 M , L\u2217=0.04 L )5\u20137 that is still undergoing accretion at a rate of \u223c 10\u221210\u221210\u22129 M yr\u22121. Its broadband infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) indicates the presence of circumstellar material in the form of a disk-like structure in which planets could originate. The non detection of millimeter continuum emission8 suggests that the current disk mass in millimeter-sized grains is less than 0.75 MEarth. For a standard gas/dust ratio of 100, this would imply a gas mass that is less than 20% of that of Jupiter. We observed J160532 with the JWST MIRI9 Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) with a spectral resolving power R \u223c1500\u20134000 covering 5\u201328 \u03bcm as part of the guaranteed time MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) (see Methods section for more details). The continuum subtracted 5\u201318 \u03bcm part of the MIRI spectrum is presented in Figure 1. Compared with mid-infrared spectra of other disks around low-mass stars obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope [10, 11, e.g.,], its shape is unusual7. The broad wavelength spectrum clearly shows two strong, broad bumps centered at 7.7 \u03bcm and 13.7 \u03bcm, not seen toward any other disk so far12. In contrast, no clear silicate emission features are found at 10 \u03bcm and 18 \u03bcm, nor any features due to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 or 11.3 \u03bcm (see spectrum in Extended Data Fig. 5). These broadband characteristics suggest that the J160532 disk is settled and evolved, with silicate grains in the disk atmosphere that must have grown to at least 5 \u03bcm. The much higher spectral resolution of MIRI-MRS compared with previous Spitzer data reveals numerous narrow hydrogen recombination lines as well as molecular features on top of the continuum (Figure 1). C2H2 emission at 13.7 \u03bcm is particularly strong, consistent with earlier findings that this molecule is enhanced in disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars7, 12, 13. We focus here on the analysis of the molecular lines and demonstrate that they can be ascribed to a mix of small aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon molecules plus CO2 but that any water lines are weak. Column density ratios are found to be very different from those found in disks around the more massive T Tauri stars.",

            "text": "Carbon is an essential element for life but how much can be delivered to young planets is still an open question. The chemical characterization of planet-forming disks is a crucial step in our understanding of the diversity and habitability of exoplanets. Very low-mass stars (< 0.2 M ) are interesting targets because they host a rich population of terrestrial planets. Here we present the JWST detection of abundant hydrocarbons in the disk of a very low-mass star obtained as part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS). In addition to very strong and broad emission from C2H2 and its 13C12CH2 isotopologue, C4H2, benzene, and possibly CH4 are identified, but water, PAH and silicate features are weak or absent. The lack of small silicate grains implies that we can look deep down into this disk. These detections testify to an active warm hydrocarbon chemistry with a high C/O ratio in the inner 0.1 au of this disk, perhaps due to destruction of carbonaceous grains. The exceptionally high C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/H2O column density ratios suggest that oxygen is locked up in icy pebbles and planetesimals outside the water iceline. This, in turn, will have significant consequences for the composition of forming exoplanets.\nM dwarfs are the most common stars in the Galaxy and are known to host exoplanets in abundance1, 2. However, the terrestrial planet-forming zones of the disks around M dwarfs have been largely inaccessible with previous observations due to limited spatial and spectral resolution and the dim nature of these objects. The source 2MASS-J16053215-1933159 (hereafter denoted as J160532) is a member of the \u223c3\u201311 Myr old Upper Scorpius star forming region at a distance of 152\u00b11 pc3, with an age of 2.6\u00b11.6 Myr4. Its spectral type of M4.75 points to a very low-mass young star (M\u2217=0.14 M , L\u2217=0.04 L )5\u20137 that is still undergoing accretion at a rate of \u223c 10\u221210\u221210\u22129 M yr\u22121. Its broadband infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) indicates the presence of circumstellar material in the form of a disk-like structure in which planets could originate. The non detection of millimeter continuum emission8 suggests that the current disk mass in millimeter-sized grains is less than 0.75 MEarth. For a standard gas/dust ratio of 100, this would imply a gas mass that is less than 20% of that of Jupiter.\nWe observed J160532 with the JWST MIRI9 Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) with a spectral resolving power R \u223c1500\u20134000 covering 5\u201328 \u00b5m as part of the guaranteed time MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) (see Methods section for more details). The continuum subtracted 5\u201318 \u00b5m part of the MIRI spectrum is presented in Figure 1. Compared with mid-infrared spectra of other disks around low-mass stars obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope [10, 11, e.g.,], its shape is unusual7. The broad wavelength spectrum clearly shows two strong, broad bumps centered at 7.7 \u00b5m and 13.7 \u00b5m, not seen toward any other disk so far12. In contrast, no clear silicate emission features are found at 10 \u00b5m and 18 \u00b5m, nor any features due to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 or 11.3 \u00b5m (see spectrum in Extended Data Fig. 5). These broadband characteristics suggest that the J160532 disk is settled and evolved, with silicate grains in the disk atmosphere that must have grown to at least 5 \u00b5m.\nThe much higher spectral resolution of MIRI-MRS compared with previous Spitzer data reveals numerous narrow hydrogen recombination lines as well as molecular features on top of the continuum (Figure 1). C2H2 emission at 13.7 \u00b5m is particularly strong, consistent with earlier findings that this molecule is enhanced in disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars7, 12, 13. We focus here on the analysis of the molecular lines and demonstrate that they can be ascribed to a mix of small aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon molecules plus CO2 but that any water lines are weak. Column density ratios are found to be very different from those found in disks around the more massive T Tauri stars.\n2/23"

The other fitting parameters are the line of sight column density N within a projected emitting area \u03c0R2 given by its radius R.

The best fitting parameters are summarized in Table 1.\nThe shape and position of any Q\u2212branch, where lines with zero change in rotational quantum number J pile up, are particularly sensitive to temperature. The full ro-vibrational bands of all considered species but H2O require a treatment of line overlap in the optically thick case. For most species with only a single feature, there is often a degeneracy between a high T , low N optically thin solution and a lower T , high N optically thick case. Uncertainties and degeneracies associated to the fits are evaluated using a \u03c72 approach following earlier studies14, 15 (see Extended Data Figure 7).\n\u2013 C2H2 and 13C12CH2: The Q-branch of C2H2 at 13.7 \u00b5m associated with the \u03bd5 bending mode on top of the broad continuum is the most prominent feature in the entire MIRI-MRS spectrum (Figure 1). At R\u223c3000, MIRI-MRS also reveals a series of P\u2212 and R\u2212branches on top of both the 13.7 \u00b5m and 7.7 \u00b5m broad bumps. The fact that these bumps coincide in location with emission from gaseous C2H2 suggests that the carrier may be due to hot and very abundant C2H2 itself. No solid material can be identified that coincides with these broad bumps, and the spacing between the features is too broad to be due to silicate absorption in a near edge-on system suggested based on Spitzer data7. We demonstrate here that both the broad and narrow components are well reproduced by a two-component model consisting of highly optically thick and more optically thin C2H2 emission.\nFigure 1 shows that the overall shape of the 13.7 \u00b5m continuum bump can be well fit by a slab of gas at\n3/23\nT = 525 K with a column density of N(C2H2)=2.4\u00d71020 cm\u22122 within an emitting area of \u03c0(0.033 au)2 (i.e, R = 0.033 au). Our fit includes the contribution of 13C12CH2, assuming a C2H2/13C12CH2 ratio of 3516. In the following, this highly optically thick and compact component is called component I. Such an exceptionally high column density of C2H2 is required to fully saturate the blended molecular lines and produce a pseudo-continuum that masks any prominent features like the Q-branch (see Extended Data Figure 6). Some fraction of the 7.7 \u00b5m combination \u03bd4 +\u03bd5 band is also recovered, but with a too high contrast between the amplitude of the narrow features and the level of the pseudo-continuum. At such high column densities, hot bands of 13C12CH2 that are not included in spectroscopic databases such as HITRAN should contribute significantly as well to the 7.7 \u00b5m bump and result in a blending of the individual lines. Proper modeling must await more complete 13C12CH2 molecular spectroscopy including highly excited bands.\nThe presence of a prominent Q\u2212branch at 13.7 \u00b5m indicates a second physical component, called component II, producing less optically thick C2H2 emission. Our MIRI-MRS data allow to distinguish also the shortward peaks at 13.63 \u00b5m and 13.68 \u00b5m due to hot bands that were blended with the main peak in lower resolution Spitzer spectra7, 13 (see Figure 1, right). These features are not tracing the bulk reservoir of C2H2 but can either unveil the hotter layer at the surface of the thick component or a more radially extended emission. As an illustration, these features are indeed well reproduced by a somewhat more extended lower column density of N(C2H2)=2.5\u00d71017cm\u22122 with R = 0.07 au at a temperature of 400 K. This component would then trace a physically distinct region, at the outer boundary of the C2H2-rich region of the disk. This is the assumption that we make for the analysis of most of the other molecules, which allows us to subtract the contribution of the two C2H2 bumps in the spectra (see Methods section and Extended Data Figure 5) and fit their features without taking into account the masking of the features by optically thick C2H2 lines from component I.\nThe Q\u2212branch of 13C12CH2 is also detected at 13.73 \u00b5m above the optically thick component I. If this emission would originate from the optically thinner component II, a C2H2/13C12CH2 abundance ratio of about 3 would be required to match the peak intensity, a value that is an order of magnitude lower than the interstellar 12C/13C ratio. More likely, this indicates a more complex layered structure than the slab model can simulate. Sophisticated models including radial and vertical gradients of temperature and a more complete spectroscopy of 13C12CH2 are needed to consistently interpret the prominent peaks of C2H2 and 13C12CH2 .\n\u2013 C4H2: The emission features at 15.92 \u00b5m highlighted in Figure 2 correspond to the Q\u2212branch of the fundamental bending mode v8 of di-acetylene, C4H2. As for other molecules, the shape of this feature depends strongly on temperature, becoming broader at higher T . Interestingly, an origin within a small emitting area of R . 0.07 au is excluded as line overlap would mask the prominent features. This supports the scenario that the C4H2 features originate from the optically thinner component II. This also motivates the choice of our reference emitting area for the thin component to R = 0.07 au. A model with T = 330 K is able to reproduce the feature at 15.92 \u00b5m as well as that at 15.88 \u00b5m. Moreover, the two emission features between 15.7\u201315.8 \u00b5m are well reproduced. \u2013 C6H6: We identified three features around 14.85 \u00b5m to be the Q\u2212branches of the fundamental and hot bending mode v4 of benzene, C6H6, presented in Figure 2. Their relative intensity is sensitive to temperature and indicates T ' 400 K. As for C4H2, compact emission (R . 0.05 au) is excluded. \u2013 CH4: Extended Data Figure 8 shows possible indications of CH4 emission. CH4 was previously seen in the GV Tau N disk17, but only in absorption. We observe emission lines at 7.65\u20137.67 \u00b5m that are aligned with the Q branch of the v4 mode of CH4. C2H2 also has many emission lines in this region, but cannot reproduce by itself this broad feature.\n4/23\nC6H6 CO2 C4H2\nContinuum subtracted MIRI-MRS spectrum Total model\nGood spectral resolution\nNote a: for H2O and CO2, the reported values correspond to an alternative fit to component II assuming that all the emission originates from the C2H2 thick component I (R = 0.033 au). Note b: fit performed by fixing the temperature to that of the corresponding C2H2 component. Uncertainties on the column densities correspond to the 1\u03c3 confidence interval obtained by fixing the emitting area and are only valid in the framework of our simple slab modelling.

            "text": "The most striking feature of the J160532 MIRI spectrum is the dominance of hydrocarbon emission, most notably C2H2, but also C4H2, C6H6 (benzene), and possibly CH4. In contrast, at best weak H2O emission is found, and CO2 has a similar column density as most hydrocarbons in component II (Table 1). Hydrocarbon molecules like C4H2 and benzene have been found previously in some astrophysical environments, including asymptotic giant branch stars, comets and moons in our own Solar System19\u201321, but not yet in the planet-forming zones of disks. These detections therefore highlight that the inner disks around very low-mass objects are indeed very rich in carbon-bearing molecules as suggested based on Spitzer data7, 12, 13. The high column densities point toward being able to probe deep down layers, likely due to a lack of grains in the inner disk.\nFigure 3 summarizes the observed column density ratios of key molecules in J160532 with those found in disks around more massive T Tauri stars15. For the latter, the sources listed in Table 8 of Salyk et al.15 with detected C2H2 and H2O are taken. The C2H2/H2O ratio for the optically thick component I is up to 5 orders of magnitude higher in the J160532 disk than for T Tauri disks, and even more if H2O is treated as an upper limit. Similarly, the C2H2/CO2 ratio is 2 orders of magnitude higher. These ratios are much higher than just the flux ratios shown in Extended Data Figure 11 since our analysis, including the hot bands and a detailed treatment of line overlap, clearly demonstrates that the C2H2 emission is highly optically thick boosting its column density by orders of magnitude. Note that these column density ratios should not be viewed as local abundance ratios since each molecular band may originate from a different part of the disk, with abundances known to vary radially and vertically22.\nNevertheless, the J160532 disk is clearly rich in hydrocarbon molecules and the observed chemical differences indicate that hydrocarbon molecules either form more efficiently in disks around very low-mass stars, or that the conditions for their survival are more favorable there. One difference is the UV spectrum\n6/23\nof the central star, which has many fewer high energy photons that can photodissociate molecules for an M-type star than for an early K- or G-type star. However, J160532 still does have some accretion consistent with its relatively young age of 2.5 Myr; its estimated FUV luminosity of log(LFUV)=\u20133.59 L 7 is comparable to that of T Tauri stars. As an M star, J160532 may also have chromospheric activity and flares producing enhanced UV and X-rays, the latter estimated7 at log(LX)=28.8 erg s\u22121.\nThe alternative possibility is enhanced C2H2 production. Carbonaceous grains and PAHs can be destroyed in the inner disk due to UV radiation, chemical processes or sublimation producing abundant C2H223, 24. Interestingly, the so-called hydrocarbon \u201csoot\u201d line as defined by the sublimation front of refractory carbon is estimated to lie at 500 K25, the temperature found for the abundant optically thick C2H2 component I. The exact location of the \u201csoot\u201d line is however uncertain and depends on the type of carbonaceous material, with some laboratory data putting sublimation of amorphous carbon grains at higher temperatures, up to 1200 K26. One possibility is therefore that we are witnessing carbon grain destruction in the inner disk. Is carbon grain destruction observable in other disks? This remains an open question to be tackled with the upcoming JWST data. If carbon grains are destroyed by UV photolysis, it could be dramatically enhanced in J160532 due to dust growth and settling which increase the penetration depth of the UV. Alternatively, carbon grain destruction could be happening primarily in the high temperature midplane that is uniquely visible in the J160532 disk but hidden from our view in most disks due to the presence of dust with high infrared optical depth.\nFurther insight into the hydrocarbon chemistry can be obtained from comparison of our observed column density ratios with those found in thermo-chemical models27 of disks around low-mass stars (see Methods section for more details). Interestingly, both benzene and C4H2 were predicted to be abundant in inner disk regions16, 28. For the optically thin C2H2 component II in which these molecules are not\n7/23\nmasked by optically thick C2H2, we find relatively good agreement with the models even though benzene is underestimated by the models (see Extended Data Table 2). Under these conditions \u2013 warm dense gas with high C2H2 abundance \u2013 one would expect also efficient PAH formation up to temperatures where erosion starts to take over29, 30. To what extent the absence of PAH features in the J160532 spectrum also implies absence of PAHs, or whether there is simply not enough UV radiation to excite and make them visible31, needs to be quantified. A detailed comparison using a physical-chemical model appropriate for the J160532 disk is postponed to a future study.\nAn additional source of C2H2 production due to carbon grain destruction in the J160532 disk would also be consistent with the fact that the observed C2H2/H2O ratio is four orders of magnitude higher than what is found in those models. CO2 is underabundant as well by two orders of magnitude. This conclusion holds irrespective of the stellar mass and adopted UV field in the models27.\nNajita et al.32, 33 suggested that the range in observed HCN/H2O ratios for T Tauri stars implies different C/O ratios in the inner disk. High HCN/H2O ratios would indicate that H2O is locked up in non-migrating pebbles and planetesimals in the outer disk beyond the water iceline. In the J160532 disk, the HCN/H2O ratio cannot be robustly constrained but the C2H2/H2O ratio is much higher than for T Tauri disks.34. In fact, thermochemical disk models of cool M-type stars predict a low H2O abundance due to the lower temperature of their disks driving much of the oxygen into O227. Still, for solar C/O ratios, CO2 is predicted to be one of the main oxygen carriers after CO and O2, in stark contrast with our estimates of the CO2/C2H2 ratio. Such high abundance ratios as found here can therefore only be reproduced if the C/O ratio of the gas in the inner disk is significantly increased compared with standard values of C/O=0.47. In fact, the models of Najita et al.32, Woitke et al.22 and Anderson et al.35 show that values of C/O&1 are needed to ensure that the bulk of the volatile oxygen is contained in CO leaving little room for H2O and CO2 production, and permitting the formation of abundant C2H2.\nWhat could cause the inner disk to be depleted in oxygen compared to carbon? Destruction of carbonrich grains helps to boost carbon and thus the gas-phase C/O ratio by about a factor of 2 compared to the volatile carbon in the interstellar medium (about 50% of the total elemental carbon), enough to put the C/O ratio close to unity. However, the very high C/O ratio inferred for the inner disk of J160532 may also point toward a depletion of oxygen. To deplete the inner disk of oxygen the most plausible mechanism would be to lock most of it up in water ice in pebbles and planetesimals in the outer disk, beyond the water snowline, which for such a low mass star is around 0.1 au36. Gas with high C/O, as often found in the outer disk37, could still be able to cross the gap. Little is known about the small scale structure of disks around very low mass stars like J160532, but our findings would imply that such dust disks are not smooth but must have significant substructure with dust and ice traps on (sub)au scales38, 39, as illustrated in Figure 4. To avoid much oxygen crossing these traps, they must develop early in the disk\u2019s evolution, perhaps due to a companion that has formed there. ALMA observations of the outer disk, and analysis of H2 and ro-vibrational CO emission from the inner disk, combined with detailed modelling, are required to constrain the gas-phase C/O and O/H elemental ratios in the inner versus outer disk and further quantify the destruction of carbon grains and the efficiency of oxygen trapping in the outer disk.\nWhat are the implications for any planets forming around J160532? The current amount of solid material contained in millimeter-sized grains in its disk after 2.5 Myr of evolution is less than an Earth mass8, but the system could have started forming planetesimals and building planets earlier in its lifetime. In fact, there is ample evidence for efficient terrestrial planet formation around very low-mass objects. The occurrence rate per M-dwarf is 2.5\u00b10.2 planets with radii of 1\u20134 REarth and periods <200 days1 . Surveys also find that short-period (<10 days) planets around stars with M\u2217 < 0.34 M are significantly overabundant relative to more massive stars2. Our JWST data reveal that the chemistry in disks around such very low-mass stars may have an even higher gaseous C/O ratio in the planet-forming zones than\n8/23\nthought before. This, in turn, could significantly affect the composition of planets that may form around them.\nTo what extent the planets inside 0.1 au are also carbon rich will depend on whether they are formed mostly from \u201cdry\u201d planetesimals in this inner disk, or whether their bulk composition and atmospheres result primarily from impacting icy planetesimals from the outer disk, as found in scenarios for making terrestrial planets40, 41. In fact, it is not clear whether planetesimals formed in the inner disk are carbon rich: our data indicate the presence of some warm silicate refractory dust producing continuum mid-infrared emission, whereas a significant fraction of the carbon may be in the gas-phase and even refractory carbon grains may have been destroyed. This carbon-rich gas could be lost from the system over time, with only a small fraction of carbon eventually included in planets42. Such a scenario likely holds for our own Earth which is known to be very carbon poor25. These two competing scenarios \u2014 making carbon-rich versus carbon-poor terrestrial planets\u2014 can be tested by comparing high sensitivity JWST observations of the chemical composition of significant samples of disks around very low-mass young stars with that of the atmospheres of terrestrial-sized planets around mature M stars like the Trappist I system43 and brown dwarfs."

Next, we performed a background correction by subtracting each dither pattern from the other associated pattern (1 from 4, 2 from 3 and vice-versa). We then applied the default class Spec2, skipping the residual fringe correction. The data were then processed by the Spec3 class, which combines the calibrated data from the different dither observations into a final level3 spectral cube. We skipped the outlier_detection and master_background methods of the class, since we already performed the background subtraction after Detector1. We set Spec3 to produce one spectral cube for each sub-band, from which we extracted the spectrum using the pipeline method extract1d. This was done in order to provide the best input for a residual fringe correction that we applied at the spectrum level."

We note that for optically thin lines, the inferred column densities are independent of the value of \u2206V whereas for optically thick emission, the inferred column densities scale approximatively as 1/\u2206V . The line emission is assumed to originate from a layer of gas with a temperature T and a line of sight column density of N. Because most of the species analysed here produce lines that are close to each other in frequency, we adopt a detailed treatment of line overlap by first computing the wavelength dependent opacity over a fine grid of wavelength (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb ' 106)\n\u03c4(\u03bb ) = \u2211 i\n\u03c40,ie\u2212(\u03bb\u2212\u03bb0,i) 2/2\u03c32\u03bb , (1)\nwhere i is the line index, \u03bb0,i is the rest wavelength of line i, \u03c3\u03bb is the intrinsic broadening of the line in \u00b5m, and \u03c40,i is the optical depth at the center of line i given by\n\u03c40 = \u221a\nln2 \u03c0 AulN\u03bb 30 4\u03c0\u2206V (xl gu gl \u2212 xu). (2)\nIn this equation, xu and xl denote the population level of the upper and lower states, gu and gl their respective statistical weights, and Aul the spontaneous downward rate of the transition. The flux density F(\u03bb ) is then computed assuming an emitting area of \u03c0R2 and a distance to the source d as:\nF(\u03bb ) = \u03c0 (\nR d\n)2 B\u03bd(T )(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03c4(\u03bb )), (3)\nand convolved at MIRI-MRS spectral resolution. This special treatment, though computationally expensive, is particularly crucial at high column densities for which overlapping lines can form an effectively\n10/23\noptically thick continuum across a relatively broad spectral range (see Extended Data Figure 6). Our code has been benchmarked against the publicly available code slabspec48.\nThe molecular data, i.e., line positions, Einstein A coefficients, statistical weights, and partition functions, were taken from the HITRAN 2020 database49, except for C6H6 for which the molecular parameters were provided based on the GEISA database50. We provide further details about the C6H6 line list used in the next section.\nProtoplanetary disks are obviously not isothermal (vertically or radially), but previous studies have shown that the LTE assumption is a good first step approximation to determine the relative column densities of molecules and physical parameters of the line-emitting regions14, 15. Non-LTE effects can play a role for the higher excited energy levels51 if the local density is less than \u223c 1015 cm\u22123. Differences up to factors of 3 in inferred column densities have been found in LTE vs non-LTE comparisons for the case of HCN ro-vibrational lines52. Since non-LTE effects are expected to be comparable and in the same direction for different molecules, the effect on column density ratios is expected to be smaller than such a factor of 3.\nGiven the overwhelming presence of the C2H2 band in the MIRI spectrum, we first fit the broad continuum bump (component I) between 12 and 17 \u00b5m using a \u03c72 approach (see Extended Data Figure 7, left) and including the contribution of 13C12CH2 with a C2H2/13C12CH2 ratio of 35, half of the interstellar medium value to account for two carbon atoms16. In order to avoid the contribution of the other molecular features, the \u03c72 fit is computed using 4 spectral windows (12.1\u221212.2 \u00b5m, 12.65\u221212.9 \u00b5m, 14.6\u221214.85 \u00b5m, and 15.5\u221215.7 \u00b5m). We then find a more optically thin model that reproduces well the main Q\u2212branches of C2H2 and 13C12CH2, assuming that this second component II originates from a different region of the disk. This model, with an emitting area corresponding to R = 0.07 au, is only illustrative since the accuracy of this fit is limited by the lack of spectroscopic data of 13C12CH2. Excited states of the \u03bd5 band of 13C12CH2 are indeed missing in the molecular databases whereas the contribution of those states to the Q\u2212branch of C2H2 is expected to be significant.\nThe resulting C2H2 models for both component I and II are then subsequently used in the analysis of the other species to identify spectral windows that are free of contamination by narrow C2H2 features (see e.g., Extended Data Figure 8). However, in order to subtract the contribution of optically thick C2H2 (component I), we do not use the best fit model but subtract a spline fit through the two broad C2H2 bumps. This strategy avoids artefacts in the subtracted spectra that would be due to the imperfect C2H2 model.\nWhen subtracting the prominent C2H2 bumps prior to the fit of the other features, we implicitly neglect mutual line overlap between C2H2 and the other species which can be relevant if the emission of the species originates from the optically thick C2H2 component I. In fact, as discussed in the main text, only the analyses of CO2 and HCN are affected by C2H2 opacity. This is because CO2 and HCN features could originate from component I and are located close to prominent C2H2 lines. For HCN, masking by C2H2 is too significant to put constraints on the amount of HCN in component I. For CO2, we conducted additional tests and find that the derived column densities of CO2 for component I change by only a factor of less than two when including mutual shielding of the lines.\nThe best fit slab model parameters (N, T , emitting area characterized by R) for the species other than C2H2 are then estimated by a \u03c72 approach (see Extended Data Figure 7). Extensive grids of models varying the column density from 1015 up to 1022 cm\u22122, in steps of 1.26 in log10-space and temperature from 100 up to 1500 K in steps of 25 K were computed. Given that C2H2 emission is highly optically thick, the fit of the 13.7 \u00b5m bump allows us to determine the emitting radius of R = 0.033 au. Interestingly, the fit of the CO2 feature points toward a similarly small emitting area. In contrast, for the C4H2 and benzene prominent features, a compact emission with R . 0.07 au is excluded. When the \u03c72 cannot constrain the\n11/23\nemitting size (optically thin lines), the same emitting radius of 0.07 au is used to evaluate or place upper limits on column densities (CH4, C6H6, C4H2, HCN). For H2O, the emitting area is unconstrained and we provide (upper limit) column densities for either component I or II in Table 1.\nIn the calculation of the \u03c72, specific spectral windows are chosen to avoid contamination by other molecular features. The 1, 2, and 3 \u03c3 confidence intervals are estimated by drawing the contours of \u2206\u03c72red = \u03c7 2 red(N,T )\u2212 \u03c72red,min corresponding to values of 2.3, 6.2, and 11.8, respectively, and using a representative noise level of \u03c3 = 0.14 mJy, where \u03c72red(N,T ) is the reduced \u03c7 2 obtained by fitting the emitting area for a given value of (N,T ) [53, see e.g.,]."

The disk is irradiated by the star whose FUV spectrum is given by its effective temperature Teff and strength by its luminosity. Extra UV due to accretion is modelled by adding a 104 K black body with a strength proportional to the observed accretion rate or LFUV. X-rays and cosmic rays are also included, the latter usually at a generic rate of \u223c 10\u221217 s\u22121.\nThe models first solve for the dust temperature given the source\u2019s luminosity, and then either assume that the gas temperature is equal to the dust temperature or solve explicitly for the gas temperature by iterating over the heating and cooling balance with a small chemical network. Typical gas temperatures in the inner (< 1 au) disk are a few thousand K at the top of the atmosphere, dropping to several hundred K deeper in the disk where most of the molecular emission originates22. Such temperatures are consistent with our inferred values of 300\u2013600 K for C2H2 and other molecules. Finally, the 2D abundance distribution of each molecule can be determined by solving the chemistry at each grid point using a more extensive chemical network. Details can be found in refs.22, 32, 57.\nMost relevant for comparison with our observations are those models that include a large hydrocarbon network. In particular, Woods & Willacy16 have developed a detailed chemical model appropriate for a disk around a T Tauri star including not just 12C but also 13C isotopologues. We take the column densities\n12/23\nat 1 au from their Table 3 for comparison in Figure 3. Walsh et al.27 have run chemical models for disks around a M dwarf, a T Tauri star and a Herbig star, to investigate how the chemistry differs across the stellar mass range. We focus here on their results for the M-dwarf disk. Walsh et al. show not only total column densities as function of disk radius, but also the column densities above the dust \u03c4 = 1 surface at 14 \u00b5m, since mid-infrared observations do not probe down to the midplane. We take the latter for our comparison. None of these models vary the input volatile C and O abundances (i.e., the amount of carbon and oxygen that can cycle between gas and ice), which are usually taken such that oxygen is more abundant than carbon at C/O=0.4.\nNajita et al.32 have also presented sophisticated inner disk models focusing on smaller molecules up to C2H2, HCN and H2O to investigate trends with disk parameters and C/O. Their models include accretional heating and stellar X-rays, but not FUV radiation in the heating and chemistry. Their model abundances of hydrocarbon molecules are clearly increased when C/O is increased. The same is found in more recent models by Woike et al.22 and Anderson et al.35.\n13/23\n1 Extended Data\nNo silicate feature\nSpitzer-IRS - 5 mJy\nJWST-MIRI\nExtended Data Figure 5. Comparison between the Spitzer-IRS spectrum and the MIRI-MRS spectrum and baseline fits of the MIRI-MRS spectrum. The Spitzer-IRS low-resolution spectrum58 has been shifted by 5 mJy to ease the comparison with the MIRI-MRS spectrum (top panel). Baseline fits used in the continuum subtracted spectrum presented in Figure 1 and 2 in the Results section are shown in the middle and bottom panel, respectively. The blue dots represent the location where the continuum is evaluated. The red curve is the interpolated continuum used to produce continuum-subtracted spectra (in grey). The presence of warm dust is evidenced by the infrared continuum emission on either sides of the two C2H2 bumps but no silicate feature is detected. HI and H2 lines are present in the spectrum and will be analysed in a next paper.\n14/23\nBlack-body\nN(C2H2) = 1020 cm-2 T = 500 K R = 0.1 au\nwith line overlap without line overlap\nT = 500 K R = 0.1 au\nN( C2\nH2 ) =\n1 02\n2 c m\n-2\n10 20 c\nm -2\n1018 cm -2\nExtended Data Figure 6. Effect of line overlap on the main C2H2 feature at 13.7 \u00b5m. Left: C2H2 emission as function of column density for T = 500 K and R = 0.1 au. Note that the Q-branch becomes highly optically thick above N(C2H2) = 1020 cm\u22122 and flattens. The contrast between the amplitude of the narrow features on either side of the Q\u2212branch and the continuum level decreases by increasing N(C2H2). A column density of at least N(C2H2)' 1020 cm\u22122 is required to fit the observations. Right: Importance of line overlap in slab models. For highly optically thick lines that are close to each other such as in the Q\u2212branch of C2H2, slab models neglecting line-overlap overestimate the fluxes. For C2H2, this effect dominates for N & 1019 cm\u22122.\nCO2C2H2 C4H2\n25/03/2023 with correct chi2 contours\nExtended Data Figure 7. Constraints obtained from \u03c72 fits. The \u03c72 maps for the fit of the 13.7 \u00b5m broad bump associated with C2H2 (left), and the CO2 (middle) and C4H2 (right) features are shown. The 1\u03c3 , 2\u03c3 , and 3\u03c3 confidence intervals are pictured in red, yellow, and orange, respectively. The best-fitting emitting radius R for each value of N and T is indicated as grey lines. In general, we find a degeneracy between a high T and low N solutions, and a low T and high N solutions. For CO2 the best fit corresponding to an emitting area of 0.033 au is chosen to alleviate the degeneracy and compare with the optically thick component of C2H2 (component I). We note that for R = 0.07 au, corresponding to component II, the CO2 feature can be fitted by either a hot and thin model or a cold and thick model. However, the thick solution over-predicts 13CO2 emission which is not detected. We therefore report in Table 1 the column density of the optically thin solution for component II.\n15/23\nContinuum subtracted MIRI-MRS spectrum Total model\nCH4 C2H2\nExtended Data Figure 8. Possible indication for CH4 emission in the 7.64-7.77 \u00b5m range. CH4 emission could be present at 7.655 \u00b5m in addition to the many C2H2 lines in this region. The column density of CH4 is estimated assuming that the emission originates from component II (see main text, Table 1). The C2H2 model in purple corresponds to the component II for which the best-fit column density has been increased by a factor of 4 to better match the series of C2H2 lines in that specific spectral region.\nContinuum subtracted MIRI-MRS spectrum C2H2 model HCN model\nExtended Data Figure 9. Constraints of the amount of HCN in the 14 \u00b5m region. The C2H2 model, including both component I and II is shown in red on top of the MIRI spectrum where the contribution of the C2H2 thick component is not subtracted. This figure shows that a maximum column density of HCN of N = 1.5\u00d71017 cm\u22122 can be hidden in the C2H2 line forest in this region assuming an origin in the optically thin component II (R = 0.07 au and T = 400 K). HCN emission from the C2H2 thick component I would be highly masked by C2H2 and therefore its column density remains unconstrained.\nSupplementary Table 2.

Assuming that the emission is either confined to the C2H2 highly optically thick component I or the optically thinner component II. The prominent features of the small hydrocarbons are associated to the extended component II only whereas the CO2 emission originates more likely from the thick component I (see main text). 2.

Possible detection of weak H2O lines in the 17.2 \u00b5m and 6.5 \u00b5m regions. The pure rotational lines at 16.5\u201318 \u00b5m can hide as much as N(H2O)=3\u00d71018 cm\u22122 assuming a fixed temperature of 525 K and a characteristic emitting radius of R = 0.033 au, corresponding to the optically thick C2H2 component I. These lines are not affected by masking of C2H2 since only very weak lines of C2H2 are present in these spectral ranges. Some lines in the 6.3-6.8 \u00b5m range are somewhat overestimated by our LTE model but non-LTE effects will tend to quench these lines compared to the pure rotational lines longward of \u223c 12\u00b5m59.\nCorrect for the distance F = F(d/140)**2\nFlux without correction\nJ160532\nExtended Data Figure 11. J160532 line fluxes compared to other disks. This figure presents a comparison of C2H2 versus H2O flux scaled to 140 pc for a number of T Tauri disks observed with Spitzer and complied by ref.60 and J160532 observed with JWST MIRI. The line fluxes for J160532 are consistently calculated by integrating the flux of the three water features at 17.12 \u00b5m, 17.22 \u00b5m, and 17.36 \u00b5m, and the C2H2 feature over a window between 13.65-13.72 \u00b5m as explained in ref.60. Leftward (resp. downward) arrows represent upper limits on H2O (resp. C2H2) line flux.\n17/23"
