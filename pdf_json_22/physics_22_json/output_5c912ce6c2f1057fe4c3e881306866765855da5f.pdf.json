    "abstractText": "In this paper, the bit error rate (BER) performance of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) systems with on-off keying (OOK) modulation and an avalanche photodiode (APD) detector are analyzed in a wide range of oceanic turbulence environment, such as lognormal, Gamma, K,Weibull, and ExponentiatedWeibull distributions. To achieving this goal, a newmathematical systemmodel is established, which has not only considered the aggregated degrading phenomena, namely the absorption, scattering, and turbulence, but also been suitable for describing UWOC with APD receiver. Then the closed-form expressions of the BER performances of UWOC with APD for different turbulence distributions are derived in detail by subdividing the working situation into high and lower inter-symbol interference (ISI) scenarios. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations show that no matter what the ISI levels are, the derived closed-form expressions for system BER under various turbulences can approximate the accurate integral ones well. This is obviously helpful to the design and performance evaluation of UWOC systems. INDEX TERMS BER performance, UWOC, APD receiver, oceanic turbulence, statistical distribution.",

INTRODUCTION In recent years, underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) has attracted many researchers because of its high data rate, low latency, and solid reliability compared with other traditional underwater counterparts [1], [2]. Similar to the transmission in a free space optical (FSO) communication, the received signal in UWOC also suffers severe aggregated degrading phenomena, namely absorption, scattering, and turbulence, which will inevitably cause channel loss and time dispersion, and thus degrade the system performance. Usually, a simple and efficient method called Monte Carlo (MC) simulation has been proposed to investigate the fading-free impulse response (FFIR) induced by the absorption and scattering [3], [4]. While as to the turbulence, a probability statistical model is generally adopted to characterize the channel fading caused by oceanic turbulence based on a series of laboratory experiment measurements [5]\u2013[8].\nSo far, based on the turbulence distributions disclosed above, many studies have been focused on the performance analyses of the UWOC with intensity modulation and PIN (Positive Intrinsic-Negative) detector. For example, in [9],\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Muhammad Zubair .\na simple PIN receiver model was adopted to evaluate both the average bit error rate (BER) and outage probability of UWOC in awide range of optical turbulence. However, in this literature, the authors only provided Gaussian quadrature approximations to the BER integral expressions derived under various turbulence distributions, nor they considered the more complicated avalanche photodiode (APD) receiver. In [10], a complicated Exponential-Generalized Gamma (EGG) distribution model was proposed to depict the mixing air bubbles and temperature gradient channel. Based on this modelling, the authors investigated the closed-form expressions for the outage, average BER, and ergodic capacity of several modulation schemes under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel plus pure absorption/scattering path loss effects neglecting inter-symbol interference (ISI). In [11], a vertical underwater visible light communication link degraded by cascaded Gamma-Gamma turbulence fading and pointing error was studied, and the associated closed-form formula for M -ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) was also derived. In [12], a differential phase-shift-keying (DPSK) modulated underwater wireless optical communication systems with an aperture receiver was presented. Based on Gamma-Gamma channel model, the analytical expressions for mean BER of UWOC over moderate to strong oceanic turbulence were derived by the help\nVOLUME 10, 2022 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Similarly as the receiver model mentioned in [9], PIN photodiodes were assumed to be the standard receivers in these cited work. Then [13] analytically studied the performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) underwater wireless optical communication systems with on-off keying (OOK), and obtained the exact and upper bound BER expressions for both the optimal and equal gain combinings. Although the so-called photon-counting approach was applied in [13] to evaluate the system\u2019s BER of single-input single-output (SISO) in the presence of signal-dependent shot noise, the Poisson distribution modeling to the shot noise and the receiver output moment generating function (MGF) complicated the whole system\u2019s analysis and corresponding computer simulations. Besides the above, [14], [15] also considered the APD receiver situations and analyzed the related BER performances of pulse position modulation (PPM) in an atmospheric turbulence environment. However, no further consideration was given in [14] to derive a closed-form formula for the studied system, and only upper bounds were deduced. While in [15], the authors used the Poisson point process to establish the receiving signal model and neglected the ISI caused by channel time dispersion, and moreover, only Gaussian numerical integration formulas were designed to compute the final results. Recently, base on the previous work in [15] and [16] extended the BER analysis of PPM to a strong Gamma-Gamma turbulence fading environment, and provided by computer simulations the BER variations versus the average APD gain, modulation order, as well as various turbulence parameters. Formore clarity of description, simple comparison of advantages and disadvantages about the mentioned-above referred work are summarized in following Table 1 shown on the top of next page.\nSince APD receiver can greatly outperform the traditional PIN one due to its intrinsic average gain [17], people prefers to use APD instead of PIN to mitigate the channel loss and then to enhance the system transmission length in seawater [18]. Despite this, however, the signal model of APD is hard to be analyzed because an excessive shot noise term relating to the input signal is introduced besides the thermal noise, and this inevitably complicates the performance analysis of UWOC. In this paper, based on the research activities about the BER analyses of UWOC with PIN under various turbulence distributions in [9], and on the shot noise term construction of APD explained in [17], we decide to extend the BER performance analyses of UWOC in [9] to a more general APD receiver scenario based on a new mathematical system model. Note that this model will consider the aggregated channel attenuation consisting of channel loss, time dispersion, and turbulenceinduced fading, and more importantly, the input-dependent shot noise besides the traditional thermal noise. We will also try our best to derive the closed-form formulas of BERs of UWOC with OOK modulation under a wide range of turbulence distributions according to our identification to the ISI.\nIn this paper, our main contributions are summarized and listed as follows:\n1) Different from the past studies, we propose a new mathematical system model to analyze the OOK BER performance of UWOC with APD receiver in a wide range of optical turbulence for the first time. Compared with the work in [13] and [15], we induce an additional input-dependent shot noise term in the received signal expression to represent the effect of APD based on the exhaustive experiments and simulation work reported in [17]. 2) An optimal decision threshold for OOK intensity modulation, which results in a minimal system BER, is provided. Based on this threshold, the instantaneous BER conditioned on aggregated fading and previously transmitted OOK symbols and its associated average BER over a general turbulence distribution are derived. Compared with the ones given in [9] and [13], the numerator terms in theQ-function argument representing the probabilities of error are unrelated to the ISI. This will obviously simplify the final BER analyses and simulations. 3) Closed-form formulas for the average system BER are derived according to different ISI identification. That is, in the high ISI scenario, due to the complicated matched filtering output of the received signal for APD, only classic gaussian quadrature or simplified trapezoidal methods could be utilized to approximate the accurate BER integration expressions. While in the case of a lower ISI, closed-form expressions for the average BER are derived through the higher transcendental Meijer-G function after some skillful manipulations to the original integrands and after necessary approximation except the special lognormal distribution. In contrast, however, only gaussian quadrature approximations were provided in [9] and [13]\u2013[15] to evaluate the average BER performance of UWOC systems.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II overviews the UWOC channel modeling and thoroughly explains our newly proposed mathematical system model for OOK modulation and APD receiver; In Section III, we describe the commonly considered statistical distributions for underwater communications and clarify how their constant parameters can be obtained; In Section IV, we derive the closed-form average BER formulas for UWOC system with APD receiver under various turbulence distributions by considering different ISI situations; In Section V, computer simulations are provided to verify our theoretical derivations and analyses; Finally, in Section VI, some conclusions are made to end the paper.\nII. CHANNEL AND SYSTEM MODEL A. CHANNEL MODELING IN UWOC Propagation of light beam in underwater medium results in interactions of photons with various seawater particles either\n25204 VOLUME 10, 2022\nin the form of absorption or scattering [19]. It is worth noting that while absorption only appears as a loss to the received optical power, the scattering is a more complex procedure which contributes to both temporal spread and attenuation of the received intensity since some of the scattered photonsmay deviate from the propagation path and not reach the receiver. The total energy loss due to the absorption and scattering can be characterized by extinction coefficient c(\u03bb) = a(\u03bb)+b(\u03bb), where a(\u03bb) and b(\u03bb) represent the absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient respectively, and \u03bb is the wavelength of light wave. Obviously, these coefficients vary with the light source wavelength, and it has been shown in [19] that the absorption and scattering have their minimum effects at the wavelength interval 400 nm<\u03bb<530 nm. Hence, UWOC system employs the blue/green region of the visible light spectrum to implement data communication.\nBased on the elaborate researches carried out in [3], [4], and [20] on the channel modeling of UWOC and related comprehensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations therein, the channel loss of UWOC caused by both absorption and scattering can be simply modeled as the so-called fading free impulse response (FFIR). In particular, the large amount of multiple scattering, depending on the water type, divergence of source beam, and field of view (FoV) of the receiver, considerably spreads the received light intensity in the temporal domain such that, for the required high data transmission rate on the order of Mbps or Gbps, the delay spread of the channel is comparable with or even larger than the transmitted bit duration, leading to a severe inter-symbol interference (ISI). For the sake of generality and accuracy, in this paper, in order to appropriately include the absorption and scattering effects, we simulate the UWOC channel based on the MC method in a similar way to [3], [4], and denote the FFIR results with h0(t) throughout our analysis. Besides the FFIR depicted above, the oceanic turbulence, which occurs as a result of random variations of the refractive index due to fluctuations of water temperature and salinity [21], is another important factor affecting the channel quality. In order to take into account the turbulence-induced fading effects as well, we multiply the FFIR of the channel\nby a positive multiplicative fading coefficient hF in a similar approach to that in [9], [13], and [24]. Depending on the experimental studies in [5], [7], and [8], the probability density function (PDF) for possible oceanic turbulence, from weak to strong, can vary in a wide range of scope, which will be discussed in section III. Moreover, extensive research activities have been carried out in the past few years on the theoretical characterization of turbulence strength under water, measured by scintillation index, and relating this metric to the physical properties and turbulence parameters of the UWOC channel [22], [23]. The scintillation index of a light wave in UWOC with instantaneous intensity I = I0hF is defined as [20]\n\u03c3 2I = E[I2]\u2212 E2[I ] E2[I ] = E[h2F ]\u2212 E 2[hF ] E2[hF ] , (1)\nwhere I0 is the fading-free intensity, hF is the multiplicative turbulence fading coefficient, and E(x) denotes the expectation value of the random variable x. Scintillation index is usually referred to as a threshold for separating the weak and strong turbulence regimes, i.e., when this parameter is smaller than unity, the channel is defined as weak turbulence, and vice versa [9].\nB. SYSTEM MODEL FOR APD RECEIVER Different from the past studies in [9] and [13], a new mathematical system model, which has adopted an APD as the receiver, is proposed and established in this paper to analyze the average BER performance of UWOC systems, in which OOK intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) are utilized. According to the research results in [17], selecting an APD as detector will induce an additional shot noise term that is proportional to the received average current intensity besides the traditional AWGN thermal noises. This means that the APD detector at the receiver side will cause more input-dependent noise, which obviously, makes a heavy burden to the system modeling and related performance analysis. Referring to the noise term construction extensively discussed in [17], this paper uses a Gaussian distribution to describe the shot noise instead\nVOLUME 10, 2022 25205\nof a conventional Poisson one. Thus the received signal mathematical model for UWOC with APD detector can be given as\nr(t) = GRx(t)+ \u221a \u03c22GRx(t) \u00b7 n0(t)+ n(t), (2)\nwhere G is the APD\u2019s average gain; R = \u03b7e/hf is the photo-current conversion factor, in which, \u03b7, e, h, and f are the quantum efficiency, the electron\u2019s charge, the Planck\u2019s constant, and the light frequency in sea water respectively; x(t) represents the received light signal impaired by the FFIR and the turbulence induced fading, i.e.\nx(t) = s(t) \u2217 h(t) = hF \u221e\u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\nbk0(t \u2212 kTb), (3)\nwhere h(t) = hFh0(t) is the channel aggregated impulse response; s(t) =\n\u2211 \u221e\nk=\u2212\u221e bkP(t \u2212 kTb) is the transmitted data sequence, in which, bk \u2208 {0, 1} is the kth time slot transmitted OOK symbol, and P(t \u2212 kTb) is the kth time slot transmitted optical signal with average power 2Pb, where Pb is the average transmitted power per symbol; Tb = 1/Rb is the symbol duration, and Rb is the data transmission rate; 0(t) = P(t) \u2217 h0(t) represents the distorted receiving signal waveform through the fading free channel; and the symbol \u2217 denotes the convolution operation. Furthermore, n(t) is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) random process, with each of its time sample having mean zero and variance \u03c3 2Tb = 4KTB/RL , where K ,T ,B, and RL are the Boltzmann constant, the temperature in Kelvin, the filter\u2019s bandwidth, and the load resistance value of the system. \u221a \u03c22GRx(t)\u00b7n0(t) is the additional shot noise term, where \u03c2 = \u221a 2eBGF is a constant related to the parameters above. In this notation, F = \u03beG+(2\u22121/G)(1\u2212\u03be ) is called excess noise factor where \u03be is the ionization rate. n0(t) is another Gaussian-distributed shot noise process with its any time sampled random variable satisfying distribution N (0, 1) and is unrelated to AWGN process n(t). Please note that in (2), we have ignored the effects of the background irradiation and the dark current noise on APD receiver, because they are far smaller to the shot noise or thermal noise term according to the computation results reported in [17] especially in deep sea waters.\nAssuming symbol-by-symbol detection, which is considered to be suboptimal in the presence of ISI, and after the matched filtering or signal correlation [25], the 0th time slot integrated current of the APD receiver during the interval [0,Tb] can be expressed as\ny = \u222b Tb 0 r(t) \u00b7M (t) dt\n=GhFb0u(s) + GhF \u22121\u2211\nk=\u2212L bku(I ,k)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 x +4\n\u221a \u03c22GRhF + \u03c5Tb ,\n(4)\nwhere M (t) is a unity value door function defined in duration [0, Tb]; u(s) = R \u222b Tb 0 0(t) dt is the matched filter\u2019s\noutput of the desired current waveform signal; u(I ,k) = R \u222b Tb 0 0(t \u2212 kTb) dt specifies the ISI due to channel temporal dispersion, and L is the channel memory length. 4 =\u222b Tb 0 \u221a\u2211 \u221e\nk=\u2212\u221e bk0(t \u2212 kTb)n0(t) dt is the matched filter\u2019s output of the shot noise n0(t) with its variance defined as \u03c3 24; and \u03c5Tb = \u222b Tb 0 n(t) dt is the integrated noise of AWGN n(t), whose variance is noted as \u03c3 2\u03c5 . Please note that, for the purpose of simple manipulation in the following simulation section, we use a series of equal-spacing samples of the signal r(t) to calculate the values of u(s) and u(I ,k), and the variances of the shot noise and thermal noise terms 4 and \u03c5Tb . Since 4 and \u03c5Tb are mutually independent Gaussian noises, the conditional PDF of y on composite signal x (see the subscript notation in (4)) can be expressed as\nfy|x(y|x)\n= 1\u221a\n2\u03c0 (\u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 )\n\u00b7 exp {\u2212 (y\u2212 GhFb0u(s) \u2212 GhF\n\u2211 \u22121 k=\u2212L bku (I ,k))2\n2(\u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 )\n}.\n(5)\nMathematically, given the decision threshold ID, the instantaneous BER for APD receiver with OOK modulation and direct decision conditioned on the channel fading hF and ISI symbol bk can be written as\nPbe|hF ,bk = Pr(0)Pr(y > ID|b0 = 0)\n+Pr(1)Pr(y < ID|b0 = 1), (6)\nwhere Pr(0) and Pr(1) are the probabilities of transmitting \u2018\u20180\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u20181\u2019\u2019 OOK symbols respectively. Since the sent signal is drawn equal-probably at the transmitter, we have Pr(0) = Pr(1) = 1/2. Pr(y>ID|b0 = 0) and Pr(y < ID|b0 = 1) are the conditional bit error probabilities when the decision threshold is set as ID and the transmitted bit b0\u2019s are \u2018\u20180\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u20181\u2019\u2019 respectively.\nAccording to [26], the optimal decision threshold ID for OOK intensity modulation, which can result in a minimal BER, is\nID = \u03c30I1 + \u03c31I0 \u03c30 + \u03c31 , (7)\nin which I0 = GhF \u2211 \u22121 k=\u2212L bku\n(I ,k) and I1 = GhFu(s)+GhF \u00b7\u2211 \u22121 k=\u2212L bku\n(I ,k) are expectations of the matched filtering output y when OOK symbol b0\u2019s are 0 and 1 respectively; \u03c30 = \u221a \u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,0 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 and \u03c31 = \u221a \u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,1 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 are the noise deviations of the total shot plus thermal noise terms, that is, 4 \u221a \u03c22GRhF and \u03c5Tb , when b0\u2019s are 0 and 1 respectively; and \u03c3 24,0 and \u03c3 2 4,1 represent the shot noise variances of 4 when b0\u2019s are 0 and 1 individually.\n25206 VOLUME 10, 2022\nIII. STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION In this section, we briefly review some well-known statistical distributions in the context of oceanic turbulence [8], [9], which will be considered as the characteristics of the fading coefficient hF to evaluate the corresponding BER performance of UWOC in an underwater aggregated FFIR and turbulence-induced fading channel. We further demonstrate how the constant parameters of each of the considered PDF distributions can be related to the scintillation index \u03c3 2I and hence to the physical parameters of the underwater turbulent channel. For simplicity of the description, without loss of generality, we also assume that the fading normalization equality is satisfied, meaning that the fading coefficients hF are normalized such that they neither contribute to the amplification nor to the attenuation of the received optical signal, i.e., E(hF ) = 1.\nA. LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTION Lognormal is one of the major statistical distributions that has been used in recent years for describing the underwater optical turbulence due to its relative simplicity [7], [27]. Lognormal distribution is generally utilized to model the fluctuations induced by weak turbulence, characterized by \u03c3 2I < 1 [15]. In this case, the channel fading coefficient hF = exp(2X ) has the following PDF as [28]\nfhF (hF ) = 1 2hF \u221a 2\u03c0\u03c3 2X exp\n( \u2212 [ln (hF )\u2212 2\u00b5X ]2\n8\u03c3 2X\n) , (8)\nwhere X = (1/2) ln (hF )denotes the fading log-amplitude which has a Gaussian distribution with mean\u00b5X and variance \u03c3 2X . It is easy to verify that the fading normalization equality for lognormal distribution leads to relation \u00b5X = \u2212\u03c3 2X between the log-amplitude mean and the variance, and therefore, lognormal distribution is a function of parameter \u03c3 2X that can be obtained by \u03c3 2 X = 0.25 ln (1+ \u03c3 2 I ) [28], where \u03c3 2I is the scintillation index determined by (1).\nB. GAMMA DISTRIBUTION Gamma distribution with shape parameter k and scale parameter \u03b8 , originally considered in [5] for describing the weak temperature-induced thermally uniform UWOC channel, can be expressed as\nfhF (hF ) = 1\n0(k)\u03b8k hk\u22121F exp (\u2212hF/\u03b8) , (9)\nwhere 0(\u25e6) denotes the Gamma function. For the Gamma distribution expressed in (9), we can obtain E(hF ) = k\u03b8 = 1 and E(h2F ) = k(k + 1)\u03b8 2. Further, according to (1), since\n\u03c3 2I = E[h2F ]\u2212 E 2[hF ] E2[hF ] = k(k + 1)\u03b82 \u2212 1 1 = \u03b8, (10)\nthe constant parameters of the Gamma distribution can be easily obtained via the given scintillation index as \u03b8 = 1/k = \u03c3 2I .\nC. K DISTRIBUTION The PDF of K distribution, which was mainly used in past optical turbulence literatures for describing strong fading in free space optical links characterized by \u03c3 2 \u2265 1, is given by [29];\nfhF (hF ) = 2\u03b1 0(\u03b1)\n(\u03b1hF )(\u03b1\u22121)/2K\u03b1\u22121(2 \u221a \u03b1hF ), (11)\nwhere Kl(x) is the lth-order modified Bessel function of the second kind, and\u03b1 is a positive parameter relating to the given scintillation index as \u03b1 = 2/(\u03c3 2I \u2212 1) because of the derived scintillation index expression \u03c3 2I = (\u03b1 + 2)/\u03b1 for K distribution [30].\nD. WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION Weibull and Exponentiated Weibull (EW) distributions have been investigated by recent laboratory experiments [7], [8] to appropriately model the moderate-to-strong underwater turbulence in the presence of air bubbles especially under the condition that the transmitter beam-expander-and-collimator (BEC) and the receiver aperture averaging lens (AAL) are adopted at the transceiver sides. The PDF of the Weibull distribution is given by\nfhF (hF ) = \u03b2\n\u03b7 (hF/\u03b7)\u03b2\u22121 exp [\u2212(hF/\u03b7)\u03b2 ], (12)\nwhere \u03b2 and \u03b7 are two constant shape parameters. For the given PDF in (12), it is not difficult to obtain its nth order origin moment as E[hnF ] = \u03b7\nn0(1 + n/\u03b2) [31]. Combining this moment expression and (1), the scintillation index is given by\n\u03c3 2I = [0(1+ 2/\u03b2)/0 2(1+ 1/\u03b2)]\u2212 1. (13)\nConsequently, we can derive the value of \u03b2 for a given scintillation index by solving (13), and then, easily achieve the value of \u03b7 as \u03b7 = 1/0(1 + 1/\u03b2) due to the fact that E(hF ) = 1.\nE. EXPONENTIATED WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION The PDF of a random variable described by the Exponentiated Weibull (EW) distribution with parameters \u03b1,\u03b2, and \u03b7 is given by\nfhF (hF ) = \u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b7 (hF/\u03b7)\u03b2\u22121 exp [\u2212(hF/\u03b7)\u03b2 ]\n\u00b7{1\u2212 exp[\u2212(hF/\u03b7)\u03b2 ]}\u03b1\u22121. (14)\nIn order to calculate the three parameters mentioned above for EWdistribution, we can directly apply the research results obtained in [31] by\n\u03b1 = 7.22\u03c3 2/3I\n0(2.487\u03c3 2/6I \u2212 0.104) , (15)\n\u03b2 = 1.012(\u03b1\u03c3 2I ) \u221213/25 + 0.142, (16) \u03b7 = 1\n\u03b10(1+ 1/\u03b2)g1(\u03b1, \u03b2) , (17)\nVOLUME 10, 2022 25207\nwhere gn(\u03b1, \u03b2) is a series defined as\ngn(\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u221e\u2211 i=0 (\u22121)i0(\u03b1) i!(i+ 1)1+n/\u03b20(\u03b1 \u2212 i) . (18)\nDue to the quick convergence speed of (18), the infinite series of gn(\u03b1, \u03b2) can be acceptably approximated using its first 10 terms [31], that is, i changes only from 0 to 9.\nIV. BER ANALYSES FOR DIFFERENT TURBULENCE DISTRIBUTIONS Considering the fact that the ISI caused by channel dispersion may be high or low in different water links, we can discuss and analyze the BER performance of UWOC systems adopting OOK modulation and APD receiver in following two situations.\nA. THE CASE OF HIGH ISI When the ISI is high in UWOC, the variances of the integrated noises at the output of the matched filter, when OOK bits are 0 and 1, are with the forms of \u03c3 20 = \u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,0 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 and \u03c3 2 1 = \u03c2 2GRhF\u03c3 24,1 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 respectively; meanwhile, the corresponding average received current values are I0 = GhF \u2211 \u22121 k=\u2212L bku\n(I ,k) and I1 = GhFu(s) + GhF \u2211 \u22121 k=\u2212L bku\n(I ,k) individually. Adopting ID as the decision threshold, which is calculated by (7), the probability of decision error, conditioned on the OOK bit being 1 at the 0th time slot, can be obtained as\nPbe|1,hF ,bk = Pr(y < ID|b0 = 1)\n= \u222b ID \u2212\u221e 1 \u221a 2\u03c0\u03c31 e \u2212 (y\u2212I1) 2 2\u03c321 dy = Q( I1 \u2212 I0 \u03c31 + \u03c30 ) = Q( GhFu(s)\u221a\n\u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,0 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 + \u221a \u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,1 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 ),\n(19)\nwhere Q(x) = (1/ \u221a 2\u03c0 )\n\u222b \u221e\nx exp(\u2212y 2/2) dy is the Gaussian\nQ-function; bk \u2019s,k = 0, 1, . . . ,L represent the 0th time slot symbol and its length-L preceding ISI symbols. And similarly, the probability of decision error, conditioned on the OOK bit being 0, is\nPbe|0,hF ,bk\n= Pr(y > ID|b0 = 0) = Q( I1 \u2212 I0 \u03c30 + \u03c31 ) = Q( GhFu(s)\u221a\n\u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,0 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 + \u221a \u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,1 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 ).\n(20)\nIt can be noted from (19) and (20) that the probabilities of error conditioned on different b0 values are entirely equal. Then the instantaneous BER conditioned on hF and bk shown\nin (6) can be simplified as\nPbe|hF ,bk\n= 1 2 [Pr(y > ID|b0 = 0)+ Pr(y < ID|b0 = 1)] = Q( GhFu(s)\u221a\n\u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,0 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 + \u221a \u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,1 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 ).\n(21)\nThus, the final BER can be obtained by averaging over the channel fadinghFas well as all the transmitted data, i.e.\nPbe = 1 N \u2211 b0 \u222b \u221e 0 Pbe|hF ,bk \u00b7 fhF (hF ) dhF , (22)\nwhere N is the number of the symbols possibly selected by b0, i.e., the total length of data frame. Please also note that the variable of summation operator being b0 is due to that the shot noise terms of \u03c3 24,0 and \u03c3 2 4,1 in Pbe|hF ,bk are related to the 0th time slot symbol. In order to derive the closed-form expressions for the average BER in (22), we denote by Pbe|bk the average version of the conditional BER in (21) over the channel fading hF , i.e.\nPbe|bk\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n0 Pbe|hF ,bk \u00b7 fhF (hF ) dhF\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n0 Q( GhFu(s)\u221a \u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,0 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 + \u221a \u03c22GRhF\u03c3 24,1 + \u03c3 2 \u03c5 )\n\u00b7fhF (hF ) dhF . (23)\nIn the following, we will provide various closed-form expressions for Pbe|bk in (23) with respect to the considered statistical distributions discussed above in high ISI scenario. Due to the variable of integration, that is hF , in the both numerator and denominator terms of Q-function dummy argument in (23), it is very hard to achieve the real closed-form BER formulas expressed by some higher transcendental function. So we will use the Gaussian quadrature approaches or simplified trapezoidal method to calculate their associated approximations."

THE CASE OF LOWER ISI When the ISI of UWOC systems is lower, meaning that the ISI caused by the channel dispersion could be ignored, the variances of the two shot noise terms, i.e. \u03c3 20 and \u03c3 2 1 can be further simplified. That is, \u03c3 20 = \u03c3 2 \u03c5 and \u03c3 2 1 = \u03c2\n2GRhF41,s+ \u03c3 2\u03c5 , in which 41,s = Nover \u00b7 (2Pb) is the sum of the squares\nof the over-sample point values of signal \u221a\u2211 \u221e\nk=\u2212\u221e bkP(t) during the interval [0,Tb] when b0 = 1, and here Nover is the over-sample number, which is determined by the OOK symbol transmission rate and time resolution of FFIR bins. The two expectation terms of y, i.e. I0 and I1, are also reduced to I0 = 0 and I1 = GhFu(s). Then the instantaneous BER conditioned on hF and bk shown in (21) can be reduced to\nPbe|hF ,bk = Q\n( GhFu(s)\n\u03c3\u03c5 + \u221a \u03c22GRhF41,s + \u03c3 2\u03c5\n)\n\u2248 Q ( GhFu(s)\u221a \u03c22GRhF41,s ) 1 = Q ( Cb0 \u221a hF ) , (32)\nwhere Cb0 is a constant coefficient defined as\nCb0 = \u221a Gu(s)\u221a \u03c22R41,s . (33)\nAnd the second approximation term in (32) is due to the consideration that the background thermal noise variance \u03c3 2\u03c5 could be ignored comparedwith term \u03c22GRhF41,s especially when we choose a larger average APD gain, for example, G = 200 (The average APD gain G depends on its applied bias voltage and is typically in the range of 10 to 200 [17]). We will show some comparative simulation results about\nthe difference between these two manipulations in the next section V.\nUsing the nearly same principle as above, we will provide the real closed-form expressions for Pbe|bk like (23) with respect to the considered statistical distributions by the help of higher transcendental functions in the case of lower ISI except the Lognormal distribution."

NUMERICAL RESULTS In this section, we shall provide some numerical results for the average BER of UWOC systems with OOK modulation and APD receiver under a wide range of oceanic turbulence characterized by various distributions discussed above. In order to keep the simulation results as accurate as possible, we consider coastal and turbid harbor water links with related typical set of absorption and scattering coefficients of (a, b) = (0.179, 0.219) and (0.336, 1.824)m\u22121 respectively [19]. Then we apply the same procedures as that in [3] and [4] and use the identically typical system parameters to simulate the channel FFIR for both laser-based collimated and LED-based diffusive links. Some of the important parameters used for the FFIR and BER simulations are listed in Table 2. Please note that a green light source with wavelength of 532nm is assumed because the blue/green region of visible light generally suffers the lowest attenuation in natural seawater according to many field tests [3], [4], [19]. Moreover, although APD receiver\u2019s bandwidth is mostly governed by the amplifier\u2019s gain bandwidth product (GBP) and APD\u2019s rise time, for the purpose of simplicity of calculation and simulation, a general larger bandwidth, that is 5GHz, is selected as the filter\u2019s bandwidth to support the simulated high data rates in this paper.\nBesides, considering that the value of the aperture diameter will affect the simulation results (also known as the aperture averaging effect in [12]), we also compare the effects of aperture size D0 of 15cm and 20cm on the BER performance of UWOC systems. Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate the temporal-domain FFIRs of a 6m LED-based diffusive UWOC link in turbid harbor waters and a 25m laserbased collimated UWOC link in coastal waters under different receiver aperture diameter situations. Comparing these two figures shows that increasing the aperture diameter will enlarge the quantized intensity obviously. And the LED-based transmission also significantly increases the\nVOLUME 10, 2022 25211\nchannel diffusivity and therefore enlarges the channel loss and temporal dispersion. Defining the time delay spread of FFIR as Td , it is not difficult to find that, for the case of 6m LED-based diffusive UWOC link, the delay spreads associated with the aperture size ofD0 = 20cm and 15 cm are Td = 4.1ns and 3.8 ns respectively. And in the case of 25m laser-based diffusive link, we have Td = 0.125ns and 0.1 ns for the two aperture sizes respectively. As a consequence, the 6m LED-based turbid harbor link has a much worse channel quality than the 25m laser-based coastal one.\nIn order to compare the impacts of different aperture diameter on the system performance, Figs. 3 and 4 depict the average BERs versus average transmitted power per bit when the APD receiver adopts different aperture size D0 in the 6m LED-based turbid harbor water link and the 25m laser-based coastal water link respectively. From the results, the average BERs of the UWOC systems when D0 = 20cm are always better than that when D0 = 15cm for different considered distributions, turbulence strength, and transmission data rate. This is obvious due to the so-called aperture averaging effect [12], since the more larger is the receiver aperture, the more received transmitting photons. Unless otherwise mentioned, in the following sections, we shall choose D0 = 20cm as the receiver aperture diameter to finish our system BER performance simulations.\nIn the remaining part of this section, we will deal with the performance analysis of UWOC systems with APD\nreceiver under a wide range of optical turbulence described by different statistical distributions considered in Section IV above. The detailed simulation and analysis are divided into two situations: the high ISI scenario and the lower one.\nWhen the ISI is high, with respect to the considered turbulence distributions, Figs. 5 to 7 illustrate the average BER comparisons between the accurate numerical integration\n25212 VOLUME 10, 2022\nresults and their associated approximate ones for various statistical distributions under different scintillation index \u03c3 2I , i.e. the turbulence strength. More specifically, Figs. 5 to 7 plot the BER versus transmitting power curves of a 6m LEDbased turbid harbor water link with more than 4ns time delay spread under the scintillation index \u03c3 2I = 0.2, 0.8, and 2 respectively, in the case of OOK data transmission rate being Rb = 200Mbps (i.e. Tb = 0.025ns, severe ISI scenario). It can be seen from the figures that, no matter what types of the scintillation index and turbulence distributions are, the approximate values using the Gaussian quadrature methods are very closed to that of the exact integration expressions. Moreover, as to the two considered distributions for modeling the weak turbulence working environment, i.e. the commonly used lognormal model and the newly used Gamma model for aptly describing the temperature-induced\nthermally uniform weak underwater channel, the performance of the Gamma distribution is worse than that of the lognormal one, especially when the turbulence strength index \u03c3 2I is getting more and more larger; meanwhile, the Weibull and EW distributions originally designed for charactering the moderate and strong turbulence present in general a more worse performance predictions in the case of weak turbulence condition (see Figs. 5 and 6). Whereas, in the case of strong turbulence situation, for example, \u03c3 2I = 2, both the lognormal and Gamma models used for depicting the weak turbulence characteristics, over- and under-estimate the BER performances of the UWOC systems, respectively, compared with the K, Weibull and EWmodels (see Fig. 7). From Fig. 5, we can clearly see that an increasing gap exists between the performance curve of Weibull distribution and those of the other distributions. This is because the working situation\nVOLUME 10, 2022 25213\nof Fig. 5 is a weak turbulence environment (\u03c3 2I = 0.2), so the Weibull distribution originally proposed to model the moderate to strong turbulence will underestimate the average BER (see Figs. 6 and 7 for the positions of the BER curves of Weibull distribution). As to the performance difference among the three models investigated for describing the moderate-to-strong turbulence, the simulation results show us that the EW outperforms the Weibull, and the performance curve of the K distribution is between the ones of the two Weibull models.\nWhen the ISI is lower (for example, Rb = 1000Mbps, i.e. Tb = 1ns, which is much greater than the time spread of FFIR bins in Fig. 1(b), we first provide Figs. 8 and 9 to show the average BER comparisons between the numerical calculation results of the accurate integration formulas and their corresponding simplified ones due to ignoring the background\nnoise term \u03c3 2\u03c5 for various turbulence distributions under different scintillation index \u03c3 2I = 0.8 and 2 respectively. From the results of Figs. 8 and 9, we can see that, the curves computed by the simplified expressions completely overlap with the original ones. This proves that the simplified method used in (32) for final closed-form expression derivation is totally correct.\nFigs. 10 and 11 depict the numerical results of the BER expressions in the original form (computed by the first Q function in (32)), the simplified form (the second one in (32)), and the closed-form expressions derived for various statistical distributions (from (34) to (39)) under different turbulence strength in the case of a lower ISI. The labels \u2018\u2018simp.\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018closed-F\u2019\u2019 in the legends of the Figs. 10 and 11 indicate the simplified form and the closed-from expressions, respectively. Through the computer simulations, we can\n25214 VOLUME 10, 2022\nobserve that the derived closed-form expressions for UWOC systems\u2019 BER under various turbulences can approximate the accurate ones very well. Meanwhile, the changing rules of the simulation curves for lower ISI situation are nearly the same as the ones of high ISI. Besides these, for the 25m laser-based coastal water links at high bit rate (Rb = 1000Mbps,Tb = 1ns), fading has a greater adverse effect on the UWOC channel because of the apparent lower ISI (Td = 0.125ns), which means the adverse multipath effect has little impact on the final signal detection.\nVI. CONCLUSION In this paper, a new mathematical system model for APD receiver, which has induced an input-dependent shot noise term, is established to analyze the BER performance of UWOC systems in a wide range of optical turbulence, such as Lognormal, K, Gamma, Weibull and EW distributions. Two working scenarios, that is, the high and lower ISI cases, are separated to derive the related closed-form BER expressions respectively. Due to the complicated matched filtering output of the received signal for APD, only the classic Gaussian quadrature or simplified trapezoidal methods could be used to approximate the accurate BER integration expressions in the case of high ISI. Whereas, in the lower ISI condition, the closed-form expressions for average BERs can almost be derived by the help of the higher transcendental Meijer-G function and further verified by computer simulations under the considered distributions after some necessary simplification and manipulations. Various simulations are also supplied and then analyzed to show the performance gaps among different turbulence distributions when scintillation index is changed.\nAPPENDIX A PROOF OF (35) In the case of the Gamma distribution, we can express Pbe|bk as\nPbe|bk = \u222b \u221e 0 Q ( Cb0 \u221a hF ) 1 0(k)\u03b8k hk\u22121F\n\u00b7 exp (\u2212hF/\u03b8 ) dhF y=hF /\u03b8 =\n\u222b \u221e 0 Q ( Cb0 \u221a \u03b8y ) 1 0(k)\u03b8k (\u03b8y)k\u22121 \u00b7 exp (\u2212y)\u03b8 dy\n= 1 0(k)\n\u222b \u221e 0 Q ( Cb0 \u221a \u03b8y ) yk\u22121e\u2212y dy.

(D.3)\nFurther using the formula (8.4.3.1) in [34] to write the exponential function e\u2212z = G1,00,1 ( z|\u22120 ) , (D.3) can be calculated as\nPbe|bk = \u03b1\n2 \u221a \u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n0 G2,01,2\n[ C2b0\u03b7y 1/\u03b2 | 1 0,1/2 ] \u00b7\n\u221e\u2211 j=0 0(\u03b1)(\u22121)j 0(\u03b1 \u2212 j) \u00b7 exp[\u2212(j+ 1)y] j! dy\n= \u03b1\n2 \u221a \u03c0 \u221e\u2211 j=0 0(\u03b1)(\u22121)j 0(\u03b1 \u2212 j)j!\n\u00b7\n\u222b \u221e\n0 G2,01,2\n[ C2b0\u03b7y 1/\u03b2 | 1 0,1/2]G 1,0 0,1[(j+ 1)y| \u2212 0 ] dy.\n(D.4)\nWith (B.4), and letting \u03b1\u2217 = 1,\u03c3 = \u2212(j + 1),\u03c9 = C2b0\u03b7, s = v = p = 1,t = u = n = 0,m = q = 2,l/k = 1/\u03b2, we can obtain the final closed-form expression of Pbe|bk as\nPbe|bk\n= \u03b1 \u221a \u03c0 l3\n(2\u03c0 )(l3+k3)/2 \u221e\u2211 j=0 0(\u03b1) 0(\u03b1 \u2212 j) \u00b7 (\u22121)j j!(1+ j)\n\u00b7G2k3,l3l3+k3,2k3 ((\u2212 l3 1+ j )l3 \u00b7 (\nC2b0\u03b7 2\n2k3 )k3 |1(l3,0),1(k3,1)1(k3,0),1(k3,1/2)).\n(D.5)\nwhere l3 and k3 are two integer numbers that satisfy l3/k3 = 1/\u03b2.\nREFERENCES [1] S.
