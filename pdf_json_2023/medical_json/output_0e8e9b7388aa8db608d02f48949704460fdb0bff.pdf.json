We aimed to describe psittacosis pneumonia and risk factors for developing severe pneumonia in this multicenter clinical study.\nMethods. We collected the data of psittacosis pneumonia cases diagnosed with metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay from April 2018 to April 2022 in 15 tertiary hospitals in China.\nResults. A total of 122 patients were enrolled; 50.0% had a definite history of bird exposure. In 81.2% of cases, onset happened in autumn or winter. The common symptoms were fever (99.2%), cough (63.1%), fatigue (52.5%), shortness of breath (50.0%), chills (37.7%), central nervous system symptoms (36.9%), myalgia (29.5%), and gastrointestinal tract symptoms (15.6%). Laboratory tests showed that >70% of cases had elevated C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase, and >50% had hyponatremia and hypoproteinemia. The most common imaging finding was consolidation (71.3%), and 42.6% of cases met the criteria for severe pneumonia. Age >65 years and male sex were the risk factors for severe pneumonia. The effective proportion of patients treated with tetracyclines was higher than that of fluoroquinolones (66/69 [95.7%] vs 18/58 [31.0%]; P < .001), and the median defervescence time was shorter. After medication adjustment when the diagnosis was clarified, 119 of 122 (97.5%) patients were finally cured and the other 3 (2.5%) died.\nConclusions. Psittacosis pneumonia has a high rate of severe disease. Proven diagnosis could be rapidly confirmed by mNGS. Tetracycline therapy had a rapid effect and a high cure rate.\nKeywords.

It is becoming more common and accounts for about 1% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [1]. The main route of transmission is\ninhalation of aerosol contaminated by Chlamydia psittaci. Human-to-human transmission has also been reported [2, 3].\nBecause of the lack of efficient routine laboratory tests for C psittaci in the past, psittacosis pneumonia was rarely reported in clinical practice. Nowadays, with the application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) [4, 5], reports of psittacosis pneumonia have rapidly increased [6\u20138]. Some patients have developed severe pneumonia and even multiple organ failure [9], which urges us rediscover psittacosis pneumonia.\nAlthough some case reports or small-sample studies have reported the clinical characteristics of psittacosis pneumonia, the profile of this disease remains vague. Our study aimed to elucidate the clinical features, treatment, and outcome of psittacosis pneumonia through a multicenter real-world study. We also analyzed the differences in clinical manifestations and\nFeatures, Treatment, and Outcome of Psittacosis Pneumonia \u2022 OFID \u2022 1\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ofid/article/10/2/ofac518/7044618 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nlaboratory examinations between patients with severe and nonsevere disease, so as to facilitate the early identification of severe psittacosis pneumonia."

Inclusion criteria were (1) age >18 years; (2) pneumonia symptoms with or without an exposure history to birds, poultry, or patients infected with psittacosis; and (3) confirmed psittacosis pneumonia via mNGS or PCR assay.\nPatients with incomplete medical records were excluded.\nCriteria of Severe Pneumonia. The validated definition of severe pneumonia includes either 1 major criterion or \u22653 minor criteria [10]. Major criteria were (1) respiratory failure with requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation and (2) septic shock with requirement of vasopressors. Minor criteria were (1) respiratory rate \u226530 breaths/minute; (2) oxygenation index \u2264250 mm Hg; (3) multilobar infiltrates; (4) confusion/disorientation; (5) blood urea nitrogen level \u22657.14 mmol/L; and (6) systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg with requirement of aggressive fluid resuscitation.\nCriteria of Clinical Stability. Criteria of clinical stability [10] included satisfying all of the following: (1) temperature \u226437.8\u00b0C; (2) heart rate \u2264100 beats/minute; (3) respiratory rate \u226424 breaths/minute; (4) systolic blood pressure \u226590 mm Hg; and (5) arterial oxygen saturation \u226590% or PaO2 \u226560 mm Hg on room air.\nDefinition of effective treatment: After 72 hours of antimicrobial treatment, the clinicians judged whether the patient had reached clinical stability or the symptoms and signs were significantly improved. If the patient had reached clinical\nstability or the symptoms and signs were significantly improved, the treatment could be regarded as effective.\nDefinition of failed treatment: After 72 hours of antibiotic treatment, the clinician determined that the patient\u2019s symptoms had not improved and treatment needed to be switched, the treatment had improved and then deteriorated, or the condition progressed, and thus the treatment was considered as failure.\nCriteria of Time of Defervescence. Defervescence time of fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, macrolides, and any combination of the above 3 categories were compared. Patients with axillary temperature <37.5 \u00b0C before treatment and treated with glucocorticoid or antipyretic drugs were excluded."

The main symptoms were high fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, expectoration, chills, myalgia, headache, and other symptoms similar to influenza. Previous studies had shown that psittacosis pneumonia was not only manifested as respiratory symptoms, but also systemic symptoms such as fatigue, headache and myalgia, CNS symptoms [11], gastrointestinal symptoms [12], infective endocarditis [13], encephalitis [14, 15], and other symptoms. In this study, 102 of 122 (86.1%) patients\nFigure 7. Adjustment of treatment regimen for patients with psittacosis pneumonia.

In this study, 2 pairs of family members were successively infected with psittacosis pneumonia, and were all exposed to birds. It was not clear whether these infections were from human-to-human transmission. Recent report found that the transmission of psittacosis could occur by human-to-human transmission, even by asymptomatic carriers or by healthcare workers [3].\nLaboratory tests showed normal or mildly elevated WBC count; elevated ESR, CRP, PCT, liver enzymes, LDH, and D-dimer; and decreased lymphocyte count, serum sodium, and albumin. Approximately 79% of the patients presented with liver damage and 17.2% with kidney injury (none of these patients had a history of renal or liver disease).\nPsittacosis pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Chlamydia pneumoniae pneumonia, and Legionella pneumonia are all\natypical pneumonia. Psittacosis pneumonia shared some common and different clinical features, and seem to have a higher rate of severe pneumonia. For Mycoplasma pneumonia, radiographic changes are given priority with interstitial pneumonia, and mainly occur among adolescents. Chlamydia pneumoniae pneumonia accounts for 10% of CAP, and the dominant age of infection is 5\u201314 years. The clinical symptoms are mild and subacute attacks are common, manifested as runny nose and sore throat or accompanied by hoarseness; fever may occur, and hospitalization is rarely required [16\u201318]. Approximately 70% of serologically documented acute infections occur in individuals who do not seek medical attention [19], which is quite different from another Chlamydia pneumonia, psittacosis pneumonia. Clinical manifestations of psittacosis pneumonia are much more severe than those of Chlamydia pneumonia. Some of the manifestations of psittacosis pneumonia are quite similar to those of Legionella pneumonia, often with extrapulmonary symptoms (eg, headache, acute mental state changes, and early pleurisy) and gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, watery diarrhea and sudden abdominal pain), and quickly develop into severe pneumonia [20, 21]. Laboratory tests for psittacosis pneumonia are also similar to those for Legionella pneumonia, including hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, elevated liver enzyme levels, and acute elevated creatine phosphokinase levels. Early diagnosis and effective therapy are critical for patient prognosis.\nIn this study, it was found that chest imaging lesions of psittacosis pneumonia patients were mostly consolidation and patchy shadow, and some patients showed hilar and mediastinal lymphadenectasis and some patients showed interstitial pneumonia. Previous studies of psittacosis pneumonia were mostly consolidation shadows [22], which should be distinguished from consolidation in other lung infections, such as pneumocystis pneumonia in people living with HIV or in the course of coronavirus disease 2019 [23]. Hilar or mediastinal lymphadenectasis was rarely reported [24]. For 1 patient with hilar and mediastinal lymphadenectasis, a lymph node biopsy was performed. Chlamydia psittaci was identified in the lymph node sample by mNGS. After minocycline treatment, the lymphadenectasis resolved. In this study, 54.9% of patients had lesions involving the right lower lobe, and 46.7% of patients had lesions involving the left lower lobe, with the lesions mostly accumulated in the lower lobe of the lung, consistent with previous reports [22, 25].\nFor the treatment of psittacosis, tetracyclines such as doxycycline or minocycline are generally recommended as the first choice, whereas macrolides such as erythromycin or azithromycin are recommended when tetracycline is contraindicated, which is different from the treatment of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumonia, for which macrolides or fluoroquinolones are the first choice [10, 26]. Due to the high drug resistance rate of common CAP pathogens to macrolides,\nTable 3.

However, this empiric regimen is not effective for psittacosis pneumonia. This may be one of the reasons why C psittaci infection is more often apparent in the mNGS report than C pneumoniae in our clinical practice in recent years.\nYang and colleagues showed that 27 patients with psittacosis pneumonia were all sensitive to quinolones and tetracyclines, and the cure rate was high [8]. Butaye et al tested the susceptibilities of 14 avian strains to doxycycline and enrofloxacin in vitro; the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of doxycycline ranged from 0.05 to 0.2 mg/L, whereas the MIC of the fluoroquinolone was 0.25 mg/L [27]. In this study, 58 of 122 (47.5%) patients were initially treated with fluoroquinolones, but 40 of 58 (69.0%) of them failed treatment, which urges us to reconsider the appropriate initial treatment of CAP as psittacosis pneumonia becomes increasingly common. Treatment with tetracyclines was an alternative choice since it has a higher cure rate than fluoroquinolones. Besides, we find that the median defervescence time of tetracyclines was shorter than fluoroquinolones in the treatment of psittacosis pneumonia.\nTherefore, for patients diagnosed with psittacosis pneumonia, tetracyclines are the first choice in the absence of contraindications. For patients with suspected psittacosis pneumonia, tetracyclines are recommended for empiric treatment, which is consistent with the recommendation of tetracyclines as one\nof the drug classes for empiric treatment of CAP in the Chinese 2016 edition of the CAP guidelines.\nIsolation of C psittaci from respiratory tract or blood specimens is one of the traditional methods for the diagnosis of psittacosis, but there are very few laboratories qualified to do this. In addition, this method is time-consuming, which limits its clinical application. Serological tests include the complementary fixation test (CFT) and micro-immunofluorescence (MIF), due to cross-serological reaction between different Chlamydia species. Currently, serological detection does not have the specificity to detect C psittaci from Chlamydia trachomatis or C pneumoniae. On the other hand, antibiotic treatment 2\u20133 weeks prior to testing may inhibit antibody development, resulting in false-negative results [22]. PCR and mNGS have higher sensitivity and specificity and are faster than culture, CFT, or MIF. The application of mNGS in refractory or critical cases facilitated the diagnosis, and allows a clear understanding of psittacosis pneumonia. Wu found that psittacosis pneumonia accounted for 8% of severe CAP with normal immune function [28], and another study showed that C psittaci is an important emerging etiology of severe CAP, contributing to 7.5% of the cases [29]. In addition, some patients may be cured by empiric treatment, leading to the underestimate of its real morbidity. Thus, C psittaci has become a common pathogen of CAP.\nChlamydia psittaci is currently divided into 9 genotypes (A\u2013 F, E/B, M56, and WC), all associated with the preferred avian\nFeatures, Treatment, and Outcome of Psittacosis Pneumonia \u2022 OFID \u2022 9\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ofid/article/10/2/ofac518/7044618 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nhost. Genotype A is associated with Psittaciformes (cockatoos, parrots, parakeets, lories), and that was the most prevalent strain. Other genotypes are associated with Columbiformes, Anseriformes, turkeys, ducks, muskrat, and cattle, respectively [30\u201332]. Genotyping C psittaci strains could provide earlier information on probable avian sources, allowing for appropriate outbreak control measures [33]. Is the different manifestation of psittacosis pneumonia related to different genotypes of C psittaci? In the future, we may use mNGS to conduct genotyping and predict drug sensitivity for psittacosis patients, and truly achieve targeted therapy."
