    "abstractText": "Aristotelia chilensis or \u201cmaqui\u201d is a tree native to Chile used in the folk medicine of the Mapuche people as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of digestive ailments, fever, and skin lesions. Maqui fruits are black berries which are considered a \u201csuperfruit\u201d with notable potential health benefits, promoted to be an antioxidant, cardioprotective, and anti-inflammatory. Maqui leaves contain non-iridoid monoterpene indole alkaloids which have previously been shown to act on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, potassium channels, and calcium channels. Here, we isolated a new alkaloid from maqui leaves, now called makomakinol, together with the known alkaloids aristoteline, hobartine, and 3-formylindole. Moreover, the polyphenols quercetine, ethyl caffeate, and the terpenes, dihydro-\u03b2-ionone and terpin hydrate, were also obtained. In light of the reported analgesic and antinociceptive properties of A. chilensis, in particular a crude mixture of alkaloids containing aristoteline and hobartinol (PMID 21585384), we therefore evaluated the activity of aristoteline and hobartine on NaV1.8, a key NaV isoform involved in nociception, using automated whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Aristoteline and hobartine both inhibited Nav1.8 with an IC50 of 68 \u00b1 3 \u03bcM and 54 \u00b1 1 \u03bcM, respectively. Hobartine caused a hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage-dependence of the activation, whereas aristoteline did not change the voltage-dependence of the activation or inactivation. The inhibitory activity of these alkaloids on NaV channels may contribute to the reported analgesic properties of Aristotelia chilensis used by the Mapuche people.",

Dysregulation of the NaV channel expression and function in peripheral sensory neurons, which results in aberrant firing, contributes to the pathology of chronic pain [1\u20133]. The NaV1.8 subtype is abundantly expressed in nociceptive (pain-sensing) neurons and, as such, is an attractive target for the treatment of pain [4\u20137].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15504. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115504 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15504 2 of 10\nAristotelia chilensis is a tree native to Chile commonly called \u201cmaqui\u201d. The Mapuche people in Chile use the leaves and fruits of Aristotelia chilensis as an anti-inflammatory for the treatment of digestive ailments, fever, and skin lesions [8]. Maqui fruits are black berries containing a high concentration of polyphenols that are promoted to have many potential health benefits, including antioxidant, cardioprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties [9]. The leaves of Aristotelia chilensis contain non-iridoid monoterpene indole alkaloids including aristoteline, aristotelone, aristone, aristoquinoline, hobartine, 8-oxohobartine, and 8-oxo-9-dehydromakomakine, some of which have inhibitory activity on the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) subtypes \u03b13\u03b24, \u03b14\u03b22, and \u03b17 [10,11]. Aristoteline is pharmacologically the most well-characterized maqui alkaloid, with potent activity at the nAChR subtype \u03b13\u03b24 (IC50 of 0.4 \u00b5M), which is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of addiction and depression [12]. Aristoteline also causes vasodilation (IC50 16 \u00b5M) via the activation of potassium channels and the inhibition of CaV1.2 in rodent vascular smooth muscle ex vivo, although the activity at the potassium and CaV channels in heterologous expression systems remains to be assessed [13]. Since aristoteline has broad activity at a range of ion channels, we hypothesized the maqui alkaloids may also have activity at NaV channels. In this study, we isolated eight natural compounds from the leaves of A. chilensis, including a new alkaloid called makomakinol, together with aristoteline, hobartine, and 3-formylindole. Moreover, the polyphenols quercetin, ethyl caffeate, and the terpenes dihydro-\u03b2-ionone and terpin hydrate were also obtained for the first time from this plant. The effects of aristoteline and hobartine on NaV1.8 and NaV1.7 were evaluated using automated whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Here, we describe for the first time that aristoteline and hobartine inhibit NaV channels with a micromolar potency."

The absolute configuration of makomakinol was determined via circular dichroism (CD) and an analysis of coupling constants. First, the CD spectra of several possible stereoisomers of makomakinol were calculated in silico and compared to the experimental CD spectrum measured for naturally occurring makomakinol, as shown in Figure 2A. Only the CD spectra calculated for the (12S,14R,16R)- and for the (12S,14R,16S)-isomer of makomakinol are in good agreement with the experimental CD-spectrum, as shown in Figure 2B. To distinguish between these two stereoisomers, the coupling constants in the 1H-NMR spectrum of natural makomakinol were analyzed, as shown in Figure 2C. In natural makomakinol, the coupling constants of 11.9 Hz and 5.1 Hz from H-16 to both of the H- 5 protons indicate a trans (11.9 Hz, dihedral angle of 168.3\u25e6) and a gauche (5.1 Hz, dihedral angle of 53.6\u25e6) configuration between these pairs of protons, which is only possible with H-16 in an axial position (16S-configuration). For the (12S,14R,16R)-isomer, which would also be in agreement with the experimental CD-spectrum, dihedral angles of 39.3\u25e6 and 75.0\u25e6 between H-16 and the two protons H-15 were determined from the calculated minimum structure, as shown in Figure 2D. Both dihedral angles are not in line with the\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15504 4 of 10\nobserved coupling constants. From these considerations, it can be concluded that the absolute configuration of natural makomakinol is 12S,14R,16S.\nInt.\u00a0J.\u00a0Mol.\u00a0Sci.\u00a02023,\u00a024,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 11\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe\u00a0absolute\u00a0configuration\u00a0of\u00a0makomakinol\u00a0was\u00a0determined\u00a0via\u00a0circular\u00a0dichroism\u00a0 (CD)\u00a0and\u00a0an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0coupling\u00a0constants.\u00a0First,\u00a0the\u00a0CD\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0several\u00a0possible\u00a0stereoisomers\u00a0of\u00a0makomakinol\u00a0were\u00a0calculated\u00a0in\u00a0silico\u00a0and\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0experimental\u00a0CD\u00a0 spectrum\u00a0measured\u00a0for\u00a0naturally\u00a0occurring\u00a0makomakinol,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a02A.\u00a0Only\u00a0 the\u00a0CD\u00a0spectra\u00a0calculated\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0(12S,14R,16R)-\u00a0and\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0(12S,14R,16S)-isomer\u00a0of\u00a0makomakinol\u00a0are\u00a0in\u00a0good\u00a0agreement\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0experimental\u00a0CD-spectrum,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a02B.\u00a0To\u00a0distinguish\u00a0between\u00a0these\u00a0two\u00a0stereoisomers,\u00a0the\u00a0coupling\u00a0constants\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a01HNMR\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0natural\u00a0makomakinol\u00a0were\u00a0analyzed,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a02C.\u00a0In\u00a0natural\u00a0 makomakinol,\u00a0the\u00a0coupling\u00a0constants\u00a0of\u00a011.9\u00a0Hz\u00a0and\u00a05.1\u00a0Hz\u00a0from\u00a0H-16\u00a0to\u00a0both\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0H15\u00a0protons\u00a0indicate\u00a0a\u00a0trans\u00a0(11.9\u00a0Hz,\u00a0dihedral\u00a0angle\u00a0of\u00a0168.3\u00b0)\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0gauche\u00a0(5.1\u00a0Hz,\u00a0dihedral\u00a0 angle\u00a0of\u00a053.6\u00b0)\u00a0configuration\u00a0between\u00a0these\u00a0pairs\u00a0of\u00a0protons,\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0only\u00a0possible\u00a0with\u00a0 H-16\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0axial\u00a0position\u00a0(16S-configuration).\u00a0For\u00a0the\u00a0(12S,14R,16R)-isomer,\u00a0which\u00a0would\u00a0 also\u00a0be\u00a0 in\u00a0agreement\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0experimental\u00a0CD-spectrum,\u00a0dihedral\u00a0angles\u00a0of\u00a039.3\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a0 75.0\u00b0\u00a0between\u00a0H-16\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0two\u00a0protons\u00a0H-15\u00a0were\u00a0determined\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0calculated\u00a0minimum\u00a0structure,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a02D.\u00a0Both\u00a0dihedral\u00a0angles\u00a0are\u00a0not\u00a0in\u00a0line\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0observed\u00a0coupling\u00a0constants.\u00a0From\u00a0these\u00a0considerations,\u00a0it\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0concluded\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0absolute\u00a0configuration\u00a0of\u00a0natural\u00a0makomakinol\u00a0is\u00a012S,14R,16S.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a02.\u00a0(A)\u00a0Experimental\u00a0CD\u00a0spectrum\u00a0for\u00a0natural\u00a0makomakinol.\u00a0(B)\u00a0Calculated\u00a0CD\u00a0spectra\u00a0for\u00a0 (12S,14R,16S)\u2212\u00a0and\u00a0(12S,14R,16R)\u2212diastereomers\u00a0of\u00a0makomakinol.\u00a0(C)\u00a0Structures\u00a0with\u00a0coupling\u00a0constants\u00a0and\u00a0calculated\u00a0dihedral\u00a0angles\u00a0(in\u00a0parentheses)\u00a0of\u00a0(12S,14R,16S)\u2212\u00a0and\u00a0(12S,14R,16R)\u2212diastereomers\u00a0 of\u00a0 makomakinol.\u00a0 (D)\u00a0 Calculate\u00a0 minimum\u00a0 structures\u00a0 of\u00a0 (12S,14R,16S)\u2212\u00a0 (left)\u00a0 and\u00a0 (12S,14R,16R)\u2212diastereomers\u00a0(right)\u00a0of\u00a0makomakinol\u00a0(ball\u2212stick\u00a0model,\u00a0nitrogen\u00a0in\u00a0blue\u00a0and\u00a0oxygen\u00a0 in\u00a0red\u00a0color).\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0"

To assess if this inhibition was state-dependent, we used an 8 s conditioning voltage step with \u221240 mV to inactivate approximately half of the available channels. Using this protocol, the potency of hobartine (IC50 20 \u00b1 2 \u00b5M) and aristoteline (IC50 30 \u00b1 6 \u00b5M) only slightly increased, indicating that unlike local anesthetics, they show a minimal preference for the inactivated state (Figure 3B,D). To assess if hobartine and aristoteline are selective for the NaV1.8 isoform, we also tested the activity at NaV1.7. Both hobartine (IC50 69 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M) and aristoteline (49 \u00b1 7 \u00b5M) inhibited the NaV1.7 peak current with a similar potency to NaV1.8 (Figure 3C,F).\nInt. J. Mol.

            "text": "Aristotelia chilensis has been widely used by the Mapuche people due its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The topical administration of crude leaf extract to the tails of mice has previously been demonstrated to be anti-nociceptive in response to radiant heat and formalin [14,15]. Therefore, in this study, we purified the main chemical constituents of a leaf extract of Aristotelia chilensis, finding a new alkaloid, makomakinol, as part of the minor constituents of the pla t with a 0.000026% yield. The absolute configuration (12S,14R,16S) was proposed by a combination f the coupling constant analysis and the CD spectra. Moreover, thi is the first time that dihydro-\u03b2-ionone n terpin hydrate were isolated from his plant. Dihydro-\u03b2-ionone or 2,4,4-trimethyl-3-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohex 2-en-1-one (CAS number 72008-46-9) is a small molecule used in perfum ry with an odor description of floral, violet, pine, and woody [16]. Natur lly, dihydro- \u03b2-ionone is part of the volatile constituents of plan s, which plays a defense role against herbivores; f r example, in can la (Brassica na us), this compound is released by the lant after herbivores attack, acting as a repell nt [17]. On the other hand, terpin hydrat was used as an expecto nt for bronchitis, but its use is controversial after the FDA found a lack of evidence for its effectiveness [18]. Together with the phytochemical characterization of the plant, we evaluated the effect of aristoteline and hobartine on NaV1.7 and NaV1.8, which are NaV subtypes expressed in peripheral sensory neurons and important analgesic targets. Consistent with the reported analgesic activity of Aristotelia chilensis, both aristoteline and hobartine inhibited NaV1.8 with a micromolar potency. In addition, both indole alkaloids inhibited NaV1.7 with a similar potency, indicating that they are unlikely to exhibit selectivity for any NaV subtype, although this remains to be assessed. The effects\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15504 7 of 10\nof hobartine on the electrophysiological properties of NaV1.8 appear to be distinct from those of simple NaV pore blockers as it exhibited an effect on the voltage-dependence of the activation, shifting the V1/2 to more negative potentials (Figure 4B) that are also distinct from those of local anesthetics which typically exhibit a more pronounced preference for the inactivated state (Figure 3B). These results agree with those obtained from a representative of the \u03b2-carboline alkaloids found in P. quassiodes, DHCT, as it also robustly shifted the voltage-dependent activation to hyperpolarized potentials [19\u201321]. In contrast, the small molecule local anaesthetic lidocaine produces a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependent inactivation [22]. On the other hand, aristoteline blocked the NaV1.8 current without affecting the voltage-dependence of the activation or inactivation (Figure 4E,F), suggesting that the inhibition may result from a physical blockage of the sodium ion pathway (pore blocker) in a manner similar to tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX), two marine alkaloids known to inhibit NaV channels [23,24]. The activity of aristoteline and hobartine at NaV1.8 and 1.7, two channel subtypes expressed in peripheral nociceptors, may contribute to the reported analgesic activity of Aristotelia chilensis leaf extracts."

Vegetal material was powdered and macerated for 3 days in water acidified with HCl to pH 3 at room temperature. The aqueous\u2013 acid layer was extracted with EtOAc and the organic solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure at 45 \u25e6C and 200 mbar to afford a gummy residue (total acid extract 110 g). Then, the acid water was alkalinized to pH 11 with NaHCO3-NaOH and subsequently extracted with EtOAc, 4 L, 3-fold. After solvent evaporation, 50 g of a gummy red extract rich in alkaloids were obtained. The crude alkaloid extract was chromatographed using a silica gel column (200\u2013300 mesh) and an increased solvent polarity, from hex 100% to EtOAc 100% to isopropanol 100%, giving fractions F1 to F6. Fraction F1 (17 g) only contained fatty acids. F2 (10 g) was eluted with hex:EtOAc 3:2 v/v giving 3-formylindole (24 mg, gummy oil, 0.0003% yield).
