1. **Investigate the role of TRAF6 in different types of cancer and inflammatory diseases.** This could be done by studying the expression levels of TRAF6 in different types of cancer cells and tissues, and by examining the effects of TRAF6 inhibition on cancer cell growth and survival.
2. **Develop new TRAF6 inhibitors based on the structure of the N-terminal domain.** This could be done by using the structure of the N-terminal domain to design new compounds that bind to TRAF6 and inhibit its activity.
3. **Study the effects of TRAF6 inhibition on the immune system.** This could be done by examining the effects of TRAF6 inhibition on the activation of immune cells, such as T cells and macrophages.
4. **Investigate the role of TRAF6 in neurodegenerative diseases.** This could be done by studying the expression levels of TRAF6 in different types of neurodegenerative diseases, and by examining the effects of TRAF6 inhibition on neuronal survival and function.
5. **Develop new therapeutic strategies for treating cancer and inflammatory diseases based on TRAF6 inhibition.** This could be done by combining TRAF6 inhibitors with other drugs or therapies, such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
