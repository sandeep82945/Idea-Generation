            "text": "Cyclodextrins (CDs) are macrocyclic a-1,4-linked glucans naturally formed by bacterial digestion of starch. They are most commonly made up of 6, 7, or 8 glucopyranose units and named a-, b-, and g-cyclodextrin, respectively.1 CDs have a truncated cone-like shape with a hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic exterior, which makes them ideal hosts for many different hydrophobic guests in water.2 CDs are industrially produced on a ton scale yearly and are used in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries to encapsulate, solubilise and/or stabilise drug molecules, fat-soluble vitamins, fatty acids, aromas, and fragrances.1,3 While b-CD is the most commonly used CD, and makes up 70% of the global CD production, it is the least soluble, which limits some applications.4 g-CD is the most soluble of the three CDs, and given its larger hydrophobic cavity and non-toxic prole, it has a great application potential, especially in the pharmaceutical industry.5 However, the use of g-CD is limited by lower accessibility, due to costly and energy-\nity of Denmark, Kemitorvet Building 207 bee@kemi.dtu.dk SI) available: Experimental procedures, esised compounds, time-resolved data ations and data tting. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\ninefficient production processes, and it constitutes only 5% of global CD production.6 Novel approaches to the production of g-CD, leading to improved manufacturing processes, could enable the wider application of g-CD in many industries.\nWe have shown that when cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) acts on an a-1,4-glucan source, an interconverting mixture of CDs and linear a-1,4-glucans is formed.7 This system can be considered as a dynamic combinatorial library (DCL), akin to the more widely known dynamic systems based on reversible covalent reactions, such as disulde exchange, hydrazone exchange and imine exchange.8 CGTase catalyses both fast, reversible transglycosylation and slow hydrolysis of a1,4-glucosidic linkages. When an a-1,4-glucan is treated with CGTase, glucose is ultimately produced as the thermodynamic product.9 However, the CDs are intrinsically more stable than the linear glucans, and so form a kinetically trapped subsystem, which operates under pseudo-thermodynamic control, wherein the product distribution reects the relative stabilities of the CDs.7 The distribution of CDs can be altered by adding a template molecule that selectively binds to, stabilises and amplies a specic CD.10\nAzobenzenes are amongst the best characterised photoswitches,11 and have been extensively explored for wide-ranging applications, such as photo-responsive polymers,12 molecular switches and machines,13 and functional materials for\nChem.

With the aim of broadening the scope to also include light-controlled synthesis of g-CD, tetra-ortho-substituted azobenzenes came to our attention. Wu and co-workers have investigated the binding of differently tetra-ortho-substituted azobenzenes to a-, b-, and gCD.18 In particular, the authors reported that tetra-orthoisopropoxy-substituted azobenzene binds to g-CD, but only as the cis-isomer.\nHerein, we present a set of water-soluble, photoswitchable templates for light-controlled enzymatic synthesis of CDs. We show that depending on the ortho-substituents, and the wavelength of light used to irradiate the DCL, we can favour the synthesis of a-, b-, and g-CDs (Fig. 1). Using the isopropoxysubstituted template (ipAzo), we can obtain g-CD in vastly improved yield, compared with the untemplated library. Moreover, this template can be readily recovered from the reaction by thermal isomerisation followed by precipitation, enabling its recycling and re-use in subsequent enzymatic syntheses."

To ensure suitable solubility at pH 7.5, the templates were appended with a hydrophilic tetracarboxylic acid motif via an aliphatic linker. Synthetic routes for the substituted azobenzene moieties were adapted from the procedure reported by Wu and co-workers.18 Synthetic schemes for the unsubstituted template (Azo) and methoxy-substituted template (mAzo) are shown in Schemes S1 and S2.\u2020 As a representative example, the synthetic route for the isopropoxy-substituted template (ipAzo) is shown in Scheme 1. Benzene-1,3,5-triol was treated with K2CO3 and 5 equivalents of 2-iodopropane at 50 \u00b0C to obtain 3,5-diisopropoxyphenol (1). 2- Nitroresorcinol was isopropylated using similar conditions, and the 2,6-diisopropoxynitrobenzene was then reduced to aniline 2 using SnCl2 and HCl in reuxing ethanol. Aniline 2 was treated with NaNO2 under acidic conditions at 0 \u00b0C to form the corresponding diazonium ion in situ, which was then reacted with phenol 1 to form azobenzene 3. The ester-protected solubilising group 5 10a was synthesised starting from diethyl 3-oxoglutarate, which was reacted with ammonium acetate in a reductive amination using sodium cyanoborohydride to obtain diethyl 3- aminoglutarate (4). 5-Hydroxyisophthalic acid was then coupled with 4 using EDC and oxyma to give the tetraester 5. The azobenzene and solubilising group were linked with an alkyl chain. 1,6-Dibromohexane was reacted with 5 using K2CO3 at 60 \u00b0C, then with 3 using NaH in dry DMF. Subsequent ester hydrolysis using aqueous NaOH in THF yielded template ipAzo. The solubility of the three templates were tested and pleasingly they were all soluble at least up to 10 mM in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM) at pH 7.5."

For bothmAzo and ipAzo, absorbance at 625 nm is very weak for the trans (as well as the cis) isomers, and irradiation for 2 hours was required to reach the photostationary state. Isomerisation from cis back to trans could in all cases be promoted by irradiation with blue light at 470 nm but this was less effective than thermal relaxation. Aer keeping the photo-irradiated solutions in the dark at 30 \u00b0C overnight, Azo, mAzo and ipAzo had thermally relaxed into 97%, 95% and 91% trans-isomer, as determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S5\u2013S7\u2020).\nThe photostationary states upon irradiation with 365 nm, 530 nm, 625 nm and 470 nm were quantied using 1H NMR spectroscopy and are listed in Table 1. Fig. 3 depicts the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectra of Azo, mAzo and ipAzo showing the photostationary states with highest observed trans and cis concentrations, respectively. Trans-Azo could be switched to 61% cis-Azo by irradiation at 365 nm. Meanwhile trans-mAzo could be switched to 92% cis-mAzo, and trans-ipAzo could be switched to 65% cis-ipAzo, by irradiation with red light at 625 nm. As all templates exhibited signicantly different cis/ trans ratios upon irradiation with light and aer thermal back relaxation, they were judged suitable to be tested for lightcontrolled CD synthesis in CGTase-mediated DCLs.\nEnzyme-mediated dynamic combinatorial libraries\nTo explore the template effects of the isomers of Azo,mAzo, and ipAzo on a CGTase-mediated DCL of cyclodextrins, a series of libraries were set up.

Before starting the enzymatic reaction, these solutions were either kept in darkness overnight or irradiated with light (30 min at 365 nm for Azo, overnight at 625 nm for mAzo, and 1.5 hours at 625 nm for ipAzo).

The library compositions were monitored over time using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) (Fig. S17\u2013S20\u2020). Fig. 4 shows the CD distributions obtained for the untemplated, templated and irradiated libraries aer 5 hours when an approximately steady product mixture had been obtained. The untemplated libraries (both irradiated and nonirradiated) evolved in the same way to give a pseudo-equilibrium distribution of approximately 31% a-CD, 56% b-CD, and 13% g-CD, calculated as % by weight of CDs present (Fig. 4a). In the presence of trans-Azo, a modest amplication of a-CD was observed, while a more signicant amplication of b-CD was observed when the DCL was irradiated at 365 nm to generate cisAzo (Fig. 4b and c). Both when mAzo was used as a template in the dark (trans-mAzo) and when irradiated at 625 nm (mostly cis-mAzo) only a small amplication of b-CD was observed compared to the untemplated library (Fig. 4d and e). While the trans-ipAzo inuenced the DCL very little (Fig. 4f), when irradiated at 625 nm to generate the cis-ipAzo, a remarkable amplication of g-CD was observed (Fig. 4g).\nFig. 5 shows the changing product distribution in the DCLs templated with ipAzo overtime. When carried out in the dark, b-\n7728 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 7725\u20137732\nCD was obtained as the major CD product (50% selectivity) within 2 hours (Fig. 5a). A gradual decrease in total CD yield (grey line) is seen due to the build-up of short linear a-1,4-glucans.7a In the DCL irradiated at 625 nm, b-CD accumulated during the rst hour, but over the following hours the dynamic system adapted to produce primarily g-CD, which reached 65% of the CD yield aer 5 hours (Fig. 5b). The system was doubly dynamic and adaptive, as the product distribution could be switched back and forth by alternate irradiation with 625 nm and 470 nm light (Fig. 5c). An ipAzo-templated DCL was started in the dark and kept in darkness for 3 hours, then irradiated with red light at 625 nm for 7 hours to promote trans to cis isomerisation, and nally irradiated with blue light at 470 nm to favour cis to trans back-isomerisation. Initially a-CD and b-CD were the primary products when the template was trans-ipAzo. Then these were converted to g-CD upon isomerisation of transipAzo to cis-ipAzo. When the light irradiation was switched from red to blue, the yield of g-CD decreased, and a-CD and b-CD concentrations increased again due to the conversion of cisipAzo to trans-ipAzo. Blue light does not induce complete cis to trans isomerisation of ipAzo (a 24 : 76 ratio of cis : trans is obtained in the photostationary state, see Table 1), and so\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The quantication of binding of photoswitches to a host is not straightforward if photoisomerisation does not give complete conversion between isomers or if thermal back relaxation is rapid. For the trans isomers of Azo, mAzo and ipAzo, sufficiently high ratios of the trans isomer (>90%) could be obtained by thermal backisomerisation in the dark, such that association constants could be obtained from standard NMR titrations and tting to a 1 : 1 binding isotherm. For the cis isomers, we used the methodology of simultaneous determination of association constants for a host to several guests in a mixture, which we have previously reported19 and applied to determine binding constants for photoswitches.17\nSolutions of all three templates (in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffered D2O at pH 7.5) were, therefore, each titrated with a-CD, b-CD, and g-CD under two different sets of conditions. The rst set was performed in darkness aer heating the template solutions at 30 \u00b0C overnight prior to the experiment to ensure maximum cis to trans thermal relaxation.

            "text": "For templated enzymatic synthesis to be of practical value for upscaled synthesis of cyclodextrins, the template should be recoverable and reusable. We have previously advocated the advantage of using a photoswitch as a template for synthesis of g-CD, in that the light-induced dissociation of the template allows for easier isolation of the synthesised CD.20 ipAzo has a further advantage, which is that it is a tetracarboxylic acid, and thus lends itself to precipitation and recovery upon acidication. We sought, therefore, to demonstrate, in a proof-ofprinciple NMR experiment, that ipAzo can not only be used to dramatically increase the yield of g-CD in the enzymatic synthesis of CDs, it can also be easily separated from the CD products and recovered for further use (Fig. 6).\nA solution of template ipAzo (10 mM) and a-CD (10 mg mL\u22121) in phosphate buffered D2O (100 mM) at pH 7.5 was irradiated at 625 nm overnight to obtain a mixture of cis- and trans-ipAzo (65 : 35) (Fig. 6b(ii)). The reaction was then started by addition of CGTase and monitored over time (Fig. 6b(iii\u2013 iv)). It was seen that the doublet due to the anomeric proton of a-CD (5.01 ppm) decreased and turned into an unresolved peak due to overlapping signals from the formed b-CD.

The signals from the aromatic protons of cis-ipAzo broadened and then disappeared, due to complexation with g-CD occurring in an intermediate exchange regime on the NMR chemical shi timescale. Broadening of these aromatic signals upon complexation of cis-ipAzo with g-CD was also observed in the titration (Fig. S16\u2020). Aer 5 hours, the reaction was stopped by denaturing the enzyme with heat (95 \u00b0C for 15 min), which also led to thermal back-isomerisation of the template to obtain trans-ipAzo and unbound g-CD as indicated by a downeld change in chemical shi of the anomeric signal from g-CD (Fig. 6b(v)). The enzyme was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was acidied by addition of triuoroacetic acid (1% v/v) leading to immediate precipitation of a red solid. The precipitate was isolated and washed with water. Analysis of the precipitate and the supernatant, using 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 6b(vi and vii)) and HPLC (Fig. S21\u2020) showed that acidication is an efficient method to separate ipAzo from the CDs.\nTo further showcase the utility of ipAzo for templated enzymatic synthesis of g-CD, the same template was used in ve consecutive preparative\u2013scale reaction cycles (starting from 23 mg a-CD and employing 22 mg of template). Each cycle was performed as just described. The ve supernatants containing CDs and linear a-1,4-glucans were combined, and g-CD was isolated by preparative HPLC in 32% yield (Fig. S22\u2020). ipAzo was recovered with high purity (Fig. S23\u2020) and in 93% yield aer the ve reaction cycles, thus demonstrating how this template can be readily recycled."

            "text": "In summary, we have shown that ortho-substituted azobenzenes can be used as photo-responsive templates to direct the selective synthesis of a-, b-, or g-CD. In particular, when irradiated with red light, the template ipAzo caused a dramatic 5-fold increase in the yield of g-CD compared to the untemplated reaction. Here, the observed amplication of g-CD in the DCL conrmed the strong and selective interaction between the cis isomer of the tetra-ortho-isopropoxy-substituted azobenzene and g-CD, as reported by Wu and co-workers18 and was in agreement with the binding affinities determined by our NMR titrations. Importantly, we showed that not only can ipAzo be used to amplify the production of g-CD, but ipAzo also dissociates upon thermallyinduced cis\u2013trans isomerisation, and can then be precipitated by acidication allowing template recycling. We suggest that this photo-removable template strategy coupled with template recycling provides an industrially relevant scalable solution to address the current challenges in g-CD production."
