"The results of this study indicate that the addition of DOTAP to β-ionone liposomes increased the particle size slightly and rendered the charge of the liposomes positive. In addition, the higher the DOTAP concentration added, the more fluid the liposomal membrane as indicated by the reduction in membrane crystallinity which supported the higher calcein release from the liposomes. The introduction of DOTAP into liposomes highly affects the physical properties of β-ionone liposomes, thereby increasing the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. From the results of this analysis, although the addition of DOTAP renders the liposomes more fluid, its ability to enhance the cellular uptake provides potential benefits when used as a delivery system for cancer therapy."
