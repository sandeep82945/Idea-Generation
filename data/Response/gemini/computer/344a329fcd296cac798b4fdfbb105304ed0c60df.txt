1. **Investigate the use of different deep learning architectures for feature extraction.** The paper uses SimCLR as the feature extractor, but other architectures, such as contrastive learning based models, may also be effective. It would be interesting to compare the performance of DeepVAT using different feature extractors.


2. **Explore the use of different dimensionality reduction techniques.** The paper uses t-SNE for dimensionality reduction, but other techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA), may also be effective. It would be interesting to compare the performance of DeepVAT using different dimensionality reduction techniques.


3. **Develop a theoretical framework for DeepVAT.** The paper provides an empirical evaluation of DeepVAT, but a theoretical framework would help to explain why DeepVAT works and to identify its limitations.


4. **Apply DeepVAT to other types of data.** The paper focuses on image data, but DeepVAT could also be applied to other types of data, such as text data or time series data. It would be interesting to explore the performance of DeepVAT on different types of data.


5. **Use DeepVAT for downstream tasks.** DeepVAT could be used as a preprocessing step for downstream tasks, such as clustering or classification. It would be interesting to investigate the performance of DeepVAT in these downstream tasks.
