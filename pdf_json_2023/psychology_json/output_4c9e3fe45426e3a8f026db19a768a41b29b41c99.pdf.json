    "abstractText": "Polymeric drug delivery systems enhance the biopharmaceutical properties of antibiotics by increasing their bioavailability, providing programmable and controlled-release properties, and reducing toxicity. In addition, drug delivery systems are a promising strategy to improve the intestinal permeability of various antimicrobial agents, including colistin (CT). This study describes the modification of conjugates based on CT and hyaluronic acid (HA) with cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12). Vitamin B12 was chosen as a targeting ligand because it has its own absorption pathway in the small intestine. The resulting polysaccharide conjugates contained 95 \u03bcg/mg vitamin B12 and the CT content was 335 \u03bcg/mg; they consisted of particles of two sizes, 98 and 702 nm, with a \u03b6-potential of approximately \u221225 mV. An in vitro release test at pH 7.4 and pH 5.2 showed an ultra-slow release of colistin of approximately 1% after 10 h. The modified B12 conjugates retained their antimicrobial activity at the level of pure CT (minimum inhibitory concentration was 2 \u03bcg/mL). The resulting delivery systems also reduced the nephrotoxicity of CT by 30\u201340% (HEK 293 cell line). In addition, the modification of B12 improved the intestinal permeability of CT, and the apparent permeability coefficient of HA\u2013CT\u2013B12 conjugates was 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm/s, corresponding to an in vivo intestinal absorption of 50\u2013100%. Thus, vitamin-B12-modified conjugates based on CT and HA may be promising oral delivery systems with improved biopharmaceutical properties.",

Bacterial resistance to modern antibiotics is increasing rapidly, and the development of new-generation antimicrobial agents is a long and expensive process; moreover, most synthesized molecules fail in the preclinical and clinical stages due to their poor biopharmaceutical properties [3]. Multidrugresistant bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, exhibit resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics (e.g., carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins) and are a major cause of mortality [4]. One potential antimicrobial drug that could benefit from various modifications of a known molecule is the peptide antibiotic colistin (CT) [5\u20137]. The disadvantages of CT therapy are its severe side effects such as nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity [8\u201310]; moreover, CT is practically not absorbed in the\nInt. J. Mol.

Sci. 2023, 24, 11550 2 of 16\ngastrointestinal tract (GIT), which limits the possible routes of its administration. Various nanotechnology-based delivery systems could improve the oral administration of CT [11,12]. The oral route of drug administration is more popular, and it is a relatively convenient and safe method of drug administration; oral administration is associated with higher patient compliance. However, absorption through the intestinal barrier is a prerequisite for the pharmacological effect of oral drugs [13]. Important factors influencing drug absorption and intestinal permeability are pH, enzymes, mucus, and the unstirred water layer, as well as the gastrointestinal membrane barrier. The main mechanisms of drug absorption across the gastrointestinal membrane are paracellular and transcellular transport. The paracellular pathway through the aqueous pores between the epithelial cells is the main mechanism for absorption of hydrophilic charged molecules or ions with a typical molecular weight cut-off of 200\u2013300 Da. In turn, transcellular transport can be realized by simple passive diffusion (relevant for small lipophilic molecules), carrier-mediated transport (active transport and facilitated diffusion), and endocytosis (the primary transport mechanism for macromolecules and particles larger than 500 nm) [14]. An example of a carrier-mediated active transport system in the small intestine, the ileum, includes the membrane transporters of cobalamin (vitamin B12). Absorption of vitamin B12 is a complex and highly efficient process involving the interaction of three transport proteins\u2014haptocorrin, intrinsic factor, and transcobalamin II\u2014and several receptors. Haptocorrin, also known as transcobalamin I, protects B12 from acid hydrolysis in gastric fluid and aids in the utilization of vitamin B12 analogues. Gastric intrinsic factor selectively binds dietary vitamin B12 and then enters intestinal cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Vitamin B12 taken up by the cells is converted to transcobalamin II and released into the systemic circulation [15,16]. As a result of its own transport system, vitamin B12 has been widely used as a targeting ligand to improve the intestinal permeability of drugs, including peptide molecules [17,18]. The strategy of improving the oral delivery of peptides and proteins by modification with vitamin B12 began with the basic research of the Russell-Jones scientific group in the 1990s, on the synthesis and oral delivery of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone, and erythropoietin with proven efficacy in vivo [19\u201321]. Currently, conjugation with vitamin B12 is being used to develop polymeric systems for oral insulin delivery. The use of B12-modified nanoparticles enhances uptake and intestinal permeability for efficient oral drug delivery, and also reduces drug toxicity [22]. Verma et al. [23] used vitamin B12 as a targeting ligand to prepare layered calcium phosphate nanoparticles for oral insulin delivery, where vitamin-B12-grafted chitosan (MW of 65\u201390 kDa, degree of deacetylation of 75\u201385%) and sodium alginate (15\u201320 cP, 1% in H2O) were the polycation and polyanion, respectively. Vitamin B12 was linked through the OH group of the ribose tail to the amino group of chitosan via a succinyl linker using carbodiimide chemistry. The developed nanoparticles had a size of approximately 250 nm and a \u03b6-potential of +32 mV. It was shown that vitamin B12, as a targeting ligand, significantly increased the bioavailability of insulin by oral administration through receptor uptake. In vitro experiments on the Caco-2 monolayer showed the higher absorption of nanoparticles based on vitamin-B12-modified chitosan compared to nanoparticles based on original chitosan. Furthermore, an in vivo study in diabetic Wistar rats showed a four-fold increase in insulin bioavailability and a sustained hypoglycemic effect within 12 h after administration of vitamin-B12-containing nanoparticles compared to nanoparticles without vitamin B12. Previously, we synthesized CT conjugates with chitosan and hyaluronic acid (HA) for the parenteral delivery of CT. The resulting conjugates, with degrees of substitution (DS) of 3\u201310%, self-assembled in water into nanosized particles (from 100 to 600 nm) and were resistant to hydrolysis (in vitro CT release at pH 7.4 and pH 5.2 was 1\u20135% after 24 h). Furthermore, the degree of substitution with CT fragments of 8\u201310% provided antimicrobial activity at the level of pure CT, as well as reduced cytotoxicity [7,24].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11550 3 of 16\nThe aim of the present study was to obtain vitamin-B12-modified conjugates of CT with HA and to investigate their potential in terms of the oral delivery of CT. It was hypothesized that functionalization with vitamin B12 would enhance intestinal permeability and absorption of the polymeric conjugates through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The concept of conjugating CT to polymers to improve its biopharmaceutical properties has been used previously [25\u201328]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to develop an oral form of CT that can be absorbed in the GI tract by grafting vitamin B12 as a targeting ligand."

The pH Stability Studies and In Vitro CT-Release Profile Vitamin B12 is absorbed by active transport in the small intestine (i.e., in the ileum,\nwith an average pH of 7.4\u20137.5) [32]. At the same time, the transit of the drug through different parts of the gastrointestinal tract with different pH levels and enzyme compositions affects its effectiveness; for successful absorption in the small intestine, the drug must be stable at the pH of the stomach (pH in the fasted/fed state) and reach the site of absorption as quickly as possible (to transit from the stomach to the intestine). Residence time in the stomach is typically from 5 min to 2 h; usually a meal prolongs the stay of the dosage form in the stomach. To accelerate the transit of the drug from the stomach to the small intestine, it is recommended to take it with water and on an empty stomach (in this case the drug almost immediately reaches the small intestine). The drug remains in the small intestine for an average of 3\u20134 h, independent of meals [14]. We sequentially studied the stability of the HA\u2013CT\u2013B12 conjugate at pH 1, 6.8, and 7.4 and showed that the syn-\nthesized compounds remained stable during transit through different parts of the gastro-\nintestinal tract and were able to reach the target site (ileum) unchanged (Table 3).

            "text": "The Caco-2 cell line (human colon adenocarcinoma) has enterocyte characteristics. After monolayer formation, the cells form junctional complexes and microvilli on the apical surface. It is known that the permeability of the Cao-2 cell monolayer is highly correlated with the processes of drug absorption in the intestine. The disadvantage of the Caco-2 cell line is its cancer origin and phenotypic instability; however, Caco-2 cells are widely used in pharmacological studies because they allow robust results to be obtained [29]. The apparent permeability coefficient in vitro (Papp) for substances absorbed through the intestinal wall by active transport had lower values compared to in vivo experiments because of the lower degree of expression of ionic and peptide transport proteins in Ca\u0441o-2 cells. Therefore, the main area of application of Ca\u0441o-2 cell culture is the qualitative assessment of intestinal permeability [33]. In general, absorption in the human GIT is 50 to 100% for compounds with an in vitro Papp greater than 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm/s. These compounds are promising for the development of oral dosage forms [34,35].

When the cells reached 60\u201370% confluence, the cells were sub-cultured into new flasks (1:6 ratio). Caco-2 cell permeability protocol: For the experiment to study permeability and changes in the barrier properties of the intestinal epithelium, cells (0.5 mL, 100,000 cells per well) were seeded on the apical side of the 1.0 \u00b5m pore diameter membrane (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) in cell culture inserts for 24-well plates. A total of 1 mL of complete DMEM medium was added to the basolateral chamber. The medium in the apical and basolateral chambers was changed every other day. Within 7 days, the cells formed a confluent monolayer and then polarized over the next 14 days, with tight junctions and microvilli formation, i.e., the cells acquired the properties of enterocytes.

Increasing the intestinal permeability of peptide antibiotics is a current and challenging task. This study included several key aspects to address this challenge. First, we developed a convenient synthetic method to modify CT- and HA-based conjugates with a specific targeting ligand (vitamin B12) to improve intestinal permeability. Second, we demonstrated the stability of the obtained conjugates under gastrointestinal conditions (at pH 1, 6.8, and 7.4), as well as the preservation of antimicrobial activity at the level of free CT (2 \u00b5g/mL), with a decrease in nephrotoxicity (by 30\u201340%). Third, we demonstrated that modification with B12 actually improved the intestinal permeability of CT; the Papp of HA\u2013CT\u2013B12 conjugates was 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm/s, which is significantly higher than the Papp of pure CT (0.04 \u00d7 10\u22126). Furthermore, the Papp value of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm/s corresponds to an in vivo intestinal absorption of 50\u2013100%. Thus, B12 modification of CT- and HA-based conjugates may be an effective strategy for the development of oral delivery systems with improved bioavailability and a reduced toxicity profile of the peptide antibiotic CT.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, N.V.D. and Y.A.S.; methodology, N.V.D., T.S.S., Y.A.D., Y.A.N., E.V.D. and Y.A.S.; investigation, N.V.D., A.N.B., T.S.S., T.S.E., Y.A.N., Y.A.D., E.A.M., E.N.V. and E.V.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, N.V.D.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.A.S.; supervision, Y.A.S.; project administration Y.A.S., funding acquisition, Y.A.S.
