1. **Investigate the relationship between IP stability and other clustering objectives.** For example, how does IP stability compare to k-means or k-center clustering in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency?
2. **Develop new algorithms for finding IP stable clusterings.** The current state-of-the-art algorithms for IP stable clustering have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of data points. Can we develop faster algorithms, perhaps with a time complexity of O(n log n) or even O(n)?
3. **Explore the use of IP stability in other applications.** IP stability has been shown to be useful for clustering data in a variety of applications, including personalized medicine, marketing, and social network analysis. Can we find other applications where IP stability can be used to improve the quality of clustering?
4. **Study the theoretical properties of IP stability.** What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a clustering to be IP stable? Can we develop a theory that explains why IP stability is a desirable property for clustering?
5. **Develop new variants of IP stability.** The current definition of IP stability is based on the average distance between points in a cluster. Can we develop new variants of IP stability that are based on other measures of distance, such as the maximum or minimum distance?
