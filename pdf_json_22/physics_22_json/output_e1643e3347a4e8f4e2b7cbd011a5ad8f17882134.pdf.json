INTRODUCTION\nRadiative transitions and decays of the neutral pseudoscalar mesons P \u00bc \u03c00, \u03b7, and \u03b70 arise through the axial anomaly and are therefore a crucial probe of the nonperturbative low-energy properties of QCD. The simplest transition to two (virtual) photons, P \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 , is specified through the transition form factor (TFF) FP\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 \u00f0q21; q22\u00de defined by the matrix element\ni Z d4x eiq1xh0jTfj\u03bc\u00f0x\u00dej\u03bd\u00f00\u00degjP\u00f0q1 \u00fe q2\u00dei\n\u00bc \u03f5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3q\u03c11q\u03c32FP\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 \u00f0q21; q22\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere j\u03bc, j\u03bd are the electromagnetic currents and q1, q2 are the photon momenta. The TFFs determine the partial decay widths to leading order in the fine-structure constant \u03b1em through\n\u0393\u00f0P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u00de \u00bc \u03c0\u03b1 2 emm3P 4 jFP\u2192\u03b3\u03b3\u00f00; 0\u00dej2; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere mP is the pseudoscalar meson mass. \u0393\u00f0\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u00de is of particular interest, since it can be used to extract the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b70 mixing angles and provides a normalization for many other \u03b7 partial widths [1]. At the same time, there is a longstanding tension between its different experimental determinations through e\u00fee\u2212 collisions on the one hand and Primakoff production on the other [2\u20138].

Recent results from the Fermilab E989 and Brookhaven E821 experiments [9,10] indicate a 4.2\u03c3 tension with the consensus on the Standard Model (SM) prediction in Refs. [11\u201331]. The uncertainty of the latter is dominated by the hadronic vacuum polarization and the HLbL scattering. In particular, matching the planned improvement on the experimental uncertainty by a factor of four in the SM evaluation, an improved control of the uncertainty of the HLbL contribution is mandatory, cf. Ref. [11]. The HLbL contribution can be estimated, among other approaches [23,32\u201340], by a systematic decomposition into contributions from various intermediate states [41\u201344]. Lattice QCD can provide ab initio data for the required form factors and hadron scattering amplitudes within this approach. This is thus complementary to a lattice-QCD calculation of the full HLbL scattering amplitude [45\u201350]. The pseudoscalar pole diagrams, depicted in Fig. 1, make\nthe dominant contribution to the HLbL scattering amplitude, with FP\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 as the key nonperturbative input. Of these diagrams, the \u03c00-pole contribution has been estimated based on a dispersive framework [26,51] and on lattice-QCD calculations of the pion TFF [27,52,53] while rational approximant fits to experimental TFF data have yielded an estimate of all three contributions [24]. A preliminary calculation of the \u03b7- and \u03b70-pole contributions using a coarse lattice was reported in Ref. [54]. Experimental results from CELLO [55], CLEO [56], and BABAR [57,58] constrain the spacelike single-virtual FP\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3\u00f0\u2212Q2; 0\u00de in the regime Q2 \u2273 1 GeV2, but do not provide data for 0 \u2264 Q2 \u2272 1 GeV2 or for general double-virtual kinematics. In contrast, these kinematics are the most accessible in lattice QCD and therefore provide highly relevant and important new information that is of interest for phenomenological models and various experimental efforts.\nIn this letter we present an ab-initio calculation of F \u03b7\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 \u00f0q21; q22\u00de and the corresponding \u03b7-pole HLbL contribution a\u03b7-pole\u03bc using lattice QCD simulations at a single lattice spacing and a single volume. We employ Nf \u00bc 2\u00fe 1\u00fe 1 flavors of twisted-mass quarks [59] tuned to the physical pion mass, physical heavy-quark masses, and maximal twist. The latter guarantees automatic O\u00f0a\u00de-improvement of observables [60,61], which here includes FP\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 , \u0393\u00f0\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u00de, b\u03b7, and a\u03b7-pole\u03bc ."

Here we use O\u2020\u03b7 \u00bc i\u03c8\u0304\u03bb8\u03b35\u03c8 , where \u03bb8 \u00bc diag\u00f01; 1;\u22122\u00de= ffiffiffi3p describes the SU\u00f03\u00de flavor structure. The validity of this choice and overlap onto the \u03b7 state are detailed in Appendix B. The electromagnetic currents are defined by j\u03bc \u00bc ZV \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bcQ\u03c8 with Q \u00bc diag\u00f0\u00fe2=3;\u22121=3; \u22121=3\u00de and ZV \u00bc 0.706378\u00f016\u00de [63]. Two remarks are in order concerning the definition of\nthe three-point function C\u03bc\u03bd using nonconserved currents. First, one can show that potential short-distance singularities are absent in Eq. (6) and that the definition admits a well defined continuum limit. The argument is given in Appendix D of Ref. [52] for Wilson fermions and, by universality, applies to Wilson twisted-mass lattice QCD as well. Second, we note that the nonconserved currents do not spoil the automatic O\u00f0a\u00de-improvement. This is because all involved lattice quantities are constructed such that their parity covariance is ensured, i.e., they have the correct symmetry property under the twisted-mass parity transformation.1 As a consequence, the symmetry excludes the appearance of O\u00f0a\u00de terms in physical matrix elements, as usual for twisted-mass lattice QCD at maximal twist [60,61], and hence guarantees automatic O\u00f0a\u00de-improvement of the three-point function in Eq. (6). Evaluating C\u03bc\u03bd requires the Wick contractions shown in Fig. 3. We evaluate all connected (sub)diagrams based on point-to-all quark propagators: we build the fully connected three-point function (top-left Wick diagram in Fig. 3) from a point-to-all propagator with spin-color diluted point sources at the vertex labeled \u201cj\u03bd,\u201d with a subsequent sequential inversion through the O\u2020\u03b7 vertex. The sequential source for this inversion is the point-to-all propagator evaluated on timeslice \u2212t\u03b7, and multiplied by \u03b35 to account for the pseudoscalar \u03b7-meson interpolator. Since the \u03b7\nmeson is taken in its rest frame, no three-momentum is inserted in the sequential source. In the P-disconnected diagram, we compute the quarkloop at O\u2020\u03b7 from propagators based on stochastic volume sources. Straightforward (undiluted) volume sources are sufficient in this case, and we ensure that the contribution from stochastic noise is suppressed below the noise from gauge configurations. The connected current-current two-point function sub-\ndiagram (top-right Wick diagram in Fig. 3) we evaluate again using spin-color diluted point-to-all propagators, to allow for efficient computation with the large range of photon three-momenta employed. Unlike in previous lattice QCD studies of the \u03c00 TFF,\nhere P-disconnected diagrams of the isospin-singlet \u03b7-meson operator are nonzero. The projection onto the \u03b7-meson state relies on a delicate cancellation between connected and P-disconnected diagram contributions, as shown in Fig. 5. The amplitude A\u0303\u03bc\u03bd is then recovered from C\u03bc\u03bd as\nA\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u00bc lim t\u03b7\u2192\u221e 2E\u03b7 Z\u03b7 eE\u03b7t\u03b7C\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0\u03c4; t\u03b7\u00de; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere Z\u03b7 \u00bc h0jO\u03b7\u00f00; 0\u20d7\u00dej\u03b7\u00f0p\u20d7\u00dei is the overlap factor associated with the chosen creation operator. In practice we approximate the limit t\u03b7 \u2192 \u221e by considering three fixed values of t\u03b7 in the range 0.80 fm\u2272 t\u03b7 \u2272 1.11 fm. Contamination from excited states and the \u03b70 meson are suppressed best for the largest value of t\u03b7, thus we report the values for \u0393\u00f0\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u00de, b\u03b7, and a\u03b7-pole\u03bc from t\u03b7 \u2248 1.11 fm as the main result and use the remaining choices to check for excited state effects.

Furthermore, the finite time\n1Ordinary parity combined with a flavor exchange. See Ref.

Details of the fitting procedure are described in Appendix C. We then integrate over \u03c4 as in Eq. (5) using numerical integration of the lattice data within the peak region, j\u03c4j \u2264 \u03c4c, and analytical integration of the fit form in the tail region, j\u03c4j > \u03c4c. In this work, we consider several choices of \u03c4c in the range 0.16 fm\u2272 \u03c4c \u2272 0.64 fm. Variation between the results computed using different choices of \u03c4c gives a measure of the uncertainties resulting from noisy data in the tails and finite time extent effects."

At finite N, it is useful to further restrict the coefficients cnm to enforce the appropriate scaling at threshold [66] by fixing the derivatives at z1;2 \u00bc \u22121 to zero, yielding the fit function\nF \u00f0z\u2212exp;N\u00de\u03b7\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 \u00f0\u2212Q21;\u2212Q22\u00de \u00bc 1\u00feQ 2 1 \u00feQ22 M2V \u22121 XN n;m\u00bc0 cnm zn1 \u2212 \u00f0\u22121\u00deN\u00fen\u00fe1 n N \u00fe 1 z N\u00fe1 1\nzm2 \u2212 \u00f0\u22121\u00deN\u00fem\u00fe1 m N \u00fe 1 z N\u00fe1 2\n\u00f014\u00de\nparameterized by N\u00f0N \u00fe 1\u00de=2 fit parameters cnm \u00bc cmn.

Regardless of the choice of Q2max, the z expansion of the form given in Eq. (13) is guaranteed to be valid by analyticity. We then fit the parameters of the function in Eq. (14) to our determined values of the TFF across all choices of q\u20d721 (the orbits shown in Fig. 2 in the main text) and for choices of \u03c91 selected per orbit to access virtualities Q21;2 for which the ratios Q21=Q 2 2 take values linearly interpolating between 0 and 1 along with the choices corresponding to exchanging Q1 \u2194 Q2. In total, we evaluate 201 choices of \u03c91 per orbit. Data that correspond to identical momentum q\u20d71 and differ only in\u03c91 are strongly correlated, as the TFF for such choices differ only in the Laplace transform applied to\nidentical lattice data. Data that correspond to distinct momenta q\u20d71 \u2260 q\u20d701 are also significantly correlated due to the common underlying gauge configurations and the global fit used in the integration of A\u0303\u00f0\u03c4\u00de. This complicates estimation of the covariance matrix required for a correlated fit. On the other hand, the model averaging procedure described in the following section is formulated to avoid needing estimates of the \u03c72 for fits. As such, throughout this work we choose to use uncorrelated z-expansion fits to the TFF data for all quantities. The use of an uncorrelated fit means that the associated \u03c72 is an unreliable measure of goodness of fit. However, the quality of the fit at order N \u00bc 2 can be seen in Fig. 5 of the main text, which shows that the conformal expansion already nearly interpolates the lattice data at all orbits using only N\u00f0N \u00fe 1\u00de=2 \u00bc 6 parameters. Thus only fits using orders N \u2264 2 were considered in this work."

            "text": "Our lattice results are obtained on the 2\u00fe 1\u00fe 1 flavor gauge ensemble cB211.072.64 produced by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) [69]. Key features of this ensemble are given in Table I. The sea-quark masses for this ensemble are tuned to be isospin symmetric (mu \u00bc md) and to reproduce the physical charged-pion mass and the strange- and charm-quark masses, with a lattice spacing of a \u2243 0.08 fm and a lattice size of L \u2243 5.09 fm (m\u03c0L \u2243 3.62) [63,69]. The lattice spacing has been determined precisely in Ref. [63] using a combined analysis of meson observables across available ETMC ensembles to control finite-size effects and pionmass dependence; in the present work, the uncertainty on the lattice-spacing determination is far below that of the lattice observables measured and these uncertainties are therefore neglected. For the valence strange quark we use the mixed action approach in Ref. [61] with a valence strange-quark doublet, whose mass is tuned such that the \u03b7 meson has physical mass. All two-point and three-point function measurements\nwere performed on a subset of 1539 configurations separated by two MDUs each. For the evaluation of the connected Wick contractions of the three-point function, we use 16 point sources per configuration (24,624 total inversions). For the current-current two-point contraction in the P-disconnected diagram of the three-point function and for the connected two-point function measurements we use 200 point sources per gauge configuration (3,07,800 total\ninversions). Finally, we use 128 stochastic sources per configuration (1,96,992 total inversions) to evaluate pseudoscalar loops in the disconnected diagrams of both the three-point and two-point functions. Due to the twistedmass valence action for the light- and strange-quark doublet we can use the \u201cone-end-trick\u201d noise reduction technique for the pseudoscalar, isoscalar loops: In twisted-mass lattice QCD the isoscalar loop (for either the light- or strangequark doublet) is represented by chiral rotation as the difference of quark loops with positive and negative twisted quark mass. The latter difference is converted into a twopoint function with an additional sum over the lattice four-volume. This volume average leads to enhanced suppression of stochastic noise and a more efficient stochastic estimator for the quark loop [70]. We show in Fig. 5 an example of the contributions to C\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0\u03c4; t\u03b7\u00de from the connected and P-disconnected Wick contractions on this ensemble at our largest separation, t\u03b7 \u2243 1.11 fm. The contributions involving strange-quark vector currents are suppressed by a factor \u223c10 for the connected and \u223c20 for the P-disconnected contribution compared to those from the light-quark vector currents. Contributions from charm-quark vector currents are expected to be even more suppressed, as are those from V-disconnected and fully disconnected diagrams (lower two diagrams in Fig. 3), based on numerical evidence from recent results for the analogous pion TFF and for the \u03b7-meson TFF [27,53,71,72].

In Fig. 6 we show our results for the TFF as a function of the virtuality in the single-virtual case F \u03b7\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3\u00f0\u2212Q2; 0\u00de (top row) and in the double-virtual case F \u03b7\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 \u00f0\u2212Q2;\u2212Q2\u00de (bottom row) together with our result from the z-expansion fits. The darker inner band indicates only statistical uncertainties while the lighter outer band includes systematic uncertainties estimated from the variation of fitting choices discussed above. At all virtualities shown, the statistical errors dominate the total uncertainty. In addition to the available experimental data, we also show the Canterbury approximant (CA) result from Ref. [24]. We observe reasonable agreement between our results, the experimental data and the CA data. From the parameterization of the momentum dependence of our TFF data we extract the decay width, slope parameter, and a\u03b7-pole\u03bc . As with the TFF itself, we repeat the calculation for all choices of the analysis parameters to determine systematic errors associated with tail fits of A\u0303\nand the z-expansion. A detailed breakdown is given in Appendix A. For the decay width the resulting systematic uncertainty stems mainly from the variation in the fits of the tails of A\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0\u03c4\u00de and \u03c4c, while for the slope parameter and the HLbL pole contribution it is mainly due to the conformal fit. The total error, however, is always dominated by the statistical uncertainties. We also observe a mild systematic dependence on t\u03b7, as detailed below, which points to the fact that excited-state and possibly \u03b70-meson contributions to the transition amplitude are not completely eliminated at the smaller values of t\u03b7. We conservatively quote results obtained at our largest value of t\u03b7 \u2243 1.11 fm for which the statistical uncertainty is largest and covers the results at the smaller t\u03b7 values. In Fig. 7 we show the dependence of the partial decay width \u0393\u00f0\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u00de, the slope parameter b\u03b7, and the \u03b7-pole contribution a\u03b7-pole\u03bc on the choice of t\u03b7 which denotes the imaginary time location of the creation operator O\u2020\u03b7\u00f0\u2212t\u03b7\u00de for the \u03b7 meson, to be compared with imaginary time\n054509-7\ncoordinates of the currents j\u03bc\u00f0\u03c4\u00de and j\u03bd\u00f00\u00de. The outer error bar denotes the total error, while the inner one shows the statistical error only. It is clear that the total error is dominated by the statistical one in all cases and for all t\u03b7 considered in this calculation. For all three quantities we observe amild systematic trendwithgrowing t\u03b7whichmaybe an indication that excited state and \u03b70-meson contributions to the transition amplitude, and hence to the quantities shown here, may still be present at the smaller values of t\u03b7. Since we are interested in the limit t\u03b7 \u2192 \u221ewe conservatively quote the results for the largest available t\u03b7 forwhich the statistical error is largest and covers the results at the smaller values of t\u03b7.

We emphasize that our results are obtained at a fixed\nlattice spacing and a fixed volume. The present estimates therefore exclude systematic errors associated with\n054509-8\nfinite-volume effects and lattice artifacts. The latter are expected to be of O\u00f0a2\u039b2QCD\u00de with the lattice discretization used here, while the former are expected to be suppressed by exp\u00f0\u2212m\u03c0L\u00de with m\u03c0L \u2243 3.62. They are hence expected to be subleading with respect to the dominating statistical and other systematic errors in the TFF. Lattice artifacts contribute through the bare TFFs, the vector-current renormalization factors (except in b\u03b7) and through the setting of the lattice scale required to convert m\u03bc to lattice units. Both ZV and the lattice scale are determined independently of the quantities considered here [63,69]. A quantitative estimate of the lattice artifacts present in a\u03b7-pole\u03bc can therefore be obtained by considering the scheme of fixing the renormalization by the physical decay width instead of the hadronic scheme. This gives a\u03b7-pole\u03bc;\u0393-renorm \u00bc 20.7\u00f04.5\u00destat\u00f02.3\u00desyst \u00d7 10\u221211, which differs from a\u03b7-pole\u03bc in Eq.

Fig. 6. Our results provide single-virtual data at lower photon virtuality than currently accessible by experiments. This includes the region around zero virtuality necessary to study the decay width and slope parameter. The results for these quantities in Eqs. (17) and (18) undershoot the experimental (and for b\u03b7 also theoretical) results by 1.5\u20132.0 standard deviations. Our lattice computation also provides TFF data for double-virtual (space-like) photon kinematics, which is difficult to access by experiment. We have made use of this advantage and calculated the \u03b7-pole contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a\u03b7-pole\u03bc \u00bc 13.8\u00f05.2\u00destat\u00f01.5\u00desyst\u00bd5.5 tot \u00d7 10\u221211. Our result confirms the currently available data-driven Canterbury approximant estimate [24] and the theoretical model estimates [68,75,76], but does not yet reach the same precision. Nevertheless, it provides important independent support of these estimates. The main shortcoming of our calculation is the use of a single lattice spacing, which will be removed in the future by computations with ETMC gauge ensembles on finer lattices [69,77]."

            "text": "All statistical errors reported in this work are given as 1\u03c3 confidence intervals derived from Nboot \u00bc 2000 bootstrap resamplings of the ensemble of configurations. We find virtually no autocorrelation between the relevant primary data taken on a subset of configurations constituting the ensemble, and the bootstrap bin size is therefore fixed to 1. During our analysis, we make several choices corresponding to fits of the large-j\u03c4j tails of the amplitude A\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0\u03c4\u00de and of the finite-volume TFF orbits. In particular, the following analysis parameters are varied: (1) The choice between using the vector meson domi-\nnance (VMD) or lowest meson dominance (LMD) model to the fit the tail behavior. (2) The window \u00f0ti; tf\u00de, determining which regions of the amplitude A\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0\u03c4\u00de are used as inputs to fit the asymptotic tail behavior. (3) The integration cutoff \u03c4c, distinguishing the region j\u03c4j \u2264 \u03c4c in which the lattice data is integrated from the region j\u03c4j > \u03c4c in which the analytical tail model is integrated. (4) The order N of the conformal expansion used to fit the TFFs. The variation of our estimates with these model choices gives estimates of the systematic errors associated with these steps. We apply the approach of Refs. [79,80] to construct cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of all final quantities with various subsets of models and with two choices of rescaling parameter \u03bb applied to the systematic error. The various total error estimates, given by the difference between the 16th and 84th percentiles of the CDF in each case, allow an extraction and decomposition of the total uncertainty into statistical, total systematic, and various individual sources. In this approach, weights must be assigned to each model included in the CDF. Weights based on the Akaike information criterion [81] derived from \u03c72 values of each fit have been employed in previous work. For the tail of the\n054509-9\namplitude, we perform a fit to values of A\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0\u03c4\u00de over sequential choices of \u03c4 and across all momentum orbits. For the z-expansion, we perform a fit to values of F \u03b7\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 \u00f0\u2212Q21;\u2212Q22\u00de across all orbits at several fixed choices of the ratio Q21=Q 2 2. As discussed in the previous section, this input data is highly correlated, and determining the correlated \u03c72 therefore requires a very precise estimate of nearly degenerate covariance matrices of both the tail fits and z-expansion fits. Even for fits to small windows \u00f0ti; tf\u00de and few choices of orbits, we found estimates of the \u03c72\nvalues to be inaccurate and unstable in our preliminary investigations. Instead, in this work we derive all results from much more stable uncorrelated fits. For the model averaging, we then make the conservative choice to use a uniform weighting of all possible models in the CDF method. This can be expected to overestimate the systematic error associated with model variation. The decomposition of uncertainties is detailed in\nTable II for all three final physical quantities studied in this work. Due to correlations between the total error estimates in each case, the decomposition does not simply add in quadrature, but nevertheless gives an estimate of which components of the error dominate the error budget. Unsurprisingly, the dominant sources of systematic errors vary depending on the observable considered. For the \u03b7-pole contribution to the HLbL, the biggest source of systematic error is the conformal fit used to extrapolate the TFF F \u03b7\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 \u00f0q21; q22\u00de from the low-virtuality orbits accessible on the lattice to the full plane of spacelike \u00f0q21; q22\u00de. This indicates that, despite the important contributions to a\u03b7-pole\u03bc from low virtualities, the large uncertainties in the nearly unconstrained higher virtualities can still affect the estimate of a\u03b7-pole\u03bc from lattice data alone. Incorporating some information about asymptotic scaling of the TFF at large virtualities is therefore an interesting prospect for future work. The other two quantities, \u0393\u00f0\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u00de and b\u03b7 are directly related to the behavior of the TFF at q21 \u00bc q22 \u00bc 0. In the case of \u0393\u00f0\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u00de, the choices used to fit the tails of the amplitude A\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0\u03c4\u00de dominate the\nsystematic errors, while for b\u03b7 the systematic uncertainties are still set by the conformal expansion fit. Nonetheless, we find that the uncertainties in all three quantities are almost entirely given by the statistical error, which always far outweighs the systematic errors. The global fit used in the integration of A\u0303\u00f0\u03c4\u00de prevents\ndecomposing the precise contribution of statistical errors to the final values of a\u03b7-pole\u03bc , \u0393\u00f0\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u00de, and b\u03b7. However, one can consider the relative contributions of various Wick contractions to A\u0303\u00f0\u03c4\u00de itself to qualitatively understand the dominant source of statistical error. This is shown for the example of the orbit jq\u20d721j \u00bc 3\u00f02\u03c0=L\u00de2 in Fig. 8, which can be compared against the plot of these same contributions in Fig. 4 of the main text. Correlations of the errors prevent interpreting the contributions as a direct decomposition of the total error, however one can still identify the Wick contractions dominating the error for various values of \u03c4. In particular, at values of j\u03c4j\u2272 0.5 fm, the P-disconnected diagrams dominate the variance, while for j\u03c4j\u2273 0.5 fm the connected light diagram also makes a notable contribution.\n054509-10"

Nevertheless, the \u03b7-meson state is the unique ground state of lowest mass, and propagation in Euclidean time systematically suppresses the contribution of the \u03b70-meson and excited states lying higher in the spectrum. This suppression scales exponentially as exp \u00f0\u2212\u00f0M \u2212m\u03b7\u00det\u00de, in terms of the Euclidean time evolution t and the relative energy gap between the mass M of the higher state and m\u03b7. This applies to all two- and three-point correlation functions used in this work. Thus for sufficiently long Euclidean time propagation, the projection onto the \u03b7-meson state is achieved by our choice of O\u20208 as the creation operator for the two-point and three-point functions."

II B, we perform global fits to the amplitudes A\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\u00f0\u03c4\u00de across all vector current momenta q\u20d71 and use the resulting functional forms instead of data when integrating Eq. (5) at large j\u03c4j. Here we detail the functional forms used for the fits, which are inspired by the vector meson dominance (VMD) and lowest meson dominance (LMD) models [82,83]. The transition form factor in the VMD and LMD models are respectively given by\nFVMD\u03b7\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 \u00f0q21; q22\u00de \u00bc \u03b1M4V\n\u00f0M2V \u2212 q21\u00de\u00f0M2V \u2212 q22\u00de \u00f0C1\u00de\nand\nFLMD\u03b7\u2192\u03b3 \u03b3 \u00f0q21; q22\u00de \u00bc \u03b1M4V \u00fe \u03b2\u00f0q21 \u00fe q22\u00de \u00f0M2V \u2212 q21\u00de\u00f0M2V \u2212 q22\u00de ; \u00f0C2\u00de\nwhere phenomenology suggests the particular choice MV \u00bc 775 MeV (the mass of the \u03c1 meson) and choices of \u03b1 and \u03b2 to respectively match the triangle anomaly, which determines F \u03b7\u2192\u03b3\u03b3\u00f00; 0\u00de to leading order [84,85], and the short distance doubly virtual behavior [86\u201389]. Note that the VMD model is simply a special case of the LMD model with \u03b2 fixed to zero. For fits to the lattice amplitude data, these parameters will be taken as free parameters of the fitting function. Inverting the relation in Eq. (5) between the TFF and amplitude A\u0303ij\u00f0\u03c4\u00de in the rest frame of the \u03b7meson results in a functional form for the amplitude using the LMDmodel (or by fixing \u03b2 \u00bc 0 the VMD model),\nA\u0303LMDij \u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u00bc \u2212im\u03b7\u03f5ijkqk1em\u03b7j\u03c4j\u0398\u00f0\u2212\u03c4\u00de \u00d7 \u00bdC\u00fee\u2212EV j\u03c4j \u2212 C\u2212e\u2212\u00f0m\u03b7\u00feEV \u00dej\u03c4j ; \u00f0C3\u00de\nwhere\nC \u2261 \u03b1M 4 V \u00fe \u03b2\u00f02M2V \u00fem2\u03b7 \u2213 2m\u03b7EV\u00de\nm\u03b7EV\u00f02EV \u2213 m\u03b7\u00de ;\nEV \u2261 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi M2V \u00fe jq\u20d71j2 q : \u00f0C4\u00de\n[1] R.
