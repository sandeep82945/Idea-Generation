    "abstractText": "In this paper, we develop a general rectangular multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (RMRT-LB) method for the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) and nonlinear convection-diffusion equation (NCDE) by extending our recent unified framework of MRT-LB method [Z.H. Chai and B.C. Shi, Phys. Rev. E 102, 023306 (2020)], where a rectangular equilibrium distribution function (REDF) [J.H. Lu et al, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 369, 2311-2319 (2011)] on a rectangular lattice is utilized. Due to the anisotropy of discrete velocities on a rectangular lattice, the third-order moment of REDF is inconsistent with that of popular LB method, and thus the previous unified framework of MRT-LB method cannot be directly applied to the NSEs using the REDF on the rectangular rDdQq (q discrete velocities in d-dimensional space, d \u2265 1) lattice. The macroscopic NSEs can be recovered from the RMRT-LB method through the direct Taylor expansion method by properly selecting the relaxation sub-matrix S2 which is related to kinetic viscosity and bulk viscosity. While the rectangular lattice does not lead to the change of the zero-th, first and second-order moments of REDF, thus the unified framework of MRT-LB method can be directly applied to the NCDE. It should be noted that the RMRT-LB model for NSEs can be derived on the rDdQq lattice, including rD2Q9, rD3Q19, and rD3Q27 lattices, while there are no rectangular D3Q13 and D3Q15 lattices within this framework of RMRT-LB method. Thanks to the block-lower triangular-relaxation matrix introduced in the unified framework, the RMRT-LB versions (if existed) of the previous MRT-LB models can be obtained, including those based on raw (natural)-moment, central-moment, Hermite-moment, and central Hermitemoment, respectively. It is also found that when the standard or regular lattice is used, and the sound speed is taken as an adjustable parameter, the present RMRT-LB method becomes a new class of MRT-LB method for the NSEs and NCDE, and the commonly used MRT-LB models on the DdQq lattice are only its special cases.

INTRODUCTION\nThe lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, as an effective mesoscopic numerical approach based on the kinetic theory, has attained increasing attention, and also gained a great success in the modeling and simulation of the complex fluid flows, heat and mass transfer described by the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations (NCDEs) [1\u20134]. Although many different LB models have been developed in the past three decades, most of them can be viewed as the special forms of the multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (MRT-LB) model [5], except those with nonlinear collision operators (e.g., the cumulant LB model [6]). The MRT-LB model uses a linear collision operator, that is, a collision matrix with multiple relaxation parameters, which extends the commonly used single-relaxation-time LB (SRT-LB) model or lattice Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (LBGK) model so that the numerical stability and accuracy can be improved by adjusting the free relaxation parameters. Actually, some previous works have shown that the MRT model is superior to the SRT model in terms of accuracy and stability, but only slightly inferior to the SRT model in the computational efficiency [5, 7, 8]. As we know, in the standard LB method for fluid flows, its evolution is carried out in a highly symmetric lattice space through two steps: collision and propagation. This makes the computational grid and lattice space coupled, resulting in that the standard LB model is generally only implemented on a uniform grid, e.g., the square lattice in two-dimensional space and the cubic lattice in three-dimension lattice. It should be noted that this restriction is caused by the requirement on the isotropy of the standard discrete velocity set, and also limits the applications of the standard LB model.\nThere are mainly four ways to design the LB method on a non-uniform grid:\n(1) The method in which the computational grid and lattice space are decoupled [9, 10].\nThis method combines the LB approach with some numerical scheme (e.g., the finite volume scheme, finite difference scheme, and finite element scheme) for the discrete velocity Boltzmann equation (DVBE), and thus both of the non-uniform grid and uniform (isotropic) lattice can be used in this kind of method.\n(2) The interpolation-supplemented LB method [11, 12].\nIn this method, spatial and temporal interpolation schemes are used to map the information on an inherent lattice grid to a computational grid where the hydrodynamic variables are obtained. Such implementations preserve the main advantages of standard LBM, and are more flexible in selecting the computational grid. However, to retain the second-order accuracy of the LB method,\na second-order or high-order interpolation must be used, which results in additional computational cost. In addition, some undesirable errors and numerical dissipation may be introduced by the interpolation, which in turn brings numerical stability concerns.\n(3) The LB method with local grid refinement [13\u201315].\nIn this method, the whole computational domain is divided into several sub-domains, and the standard LB model is used in each sub-domain which has its own uniform lattice. Two adjacent sub-domains with different lattices may share a common ghost boundary, and the distribution functions (DFs) and/or physical quantities on the ghost boundary need to be determined by some suitable interpolation schemes from both sides of the ghost boundary. Generally, the domaindecomposition technique can be utilized in dividing the domain, and each sub-domain can use its own coordinates system and regular lattice [14]. However, the shortcomings caused by interpolation are also remained in this method.\n(4) The LB method on the rectangular lattice.\nUnlike the above methods, this method is expected to be a natural and direct extension of the standard LB method on a uniform lattice, and also keeps the collision-propagation characteristics of the latter. Compared to the rectangular LB (RLB) model for NCDE, the development of the RLB model for NSEs is not well due to the inconsistency between the anisotropy of discrete veolcitites caused by the rectangular lattice and the isotropic viscosity of the NSEs. In fact, when the SRT collision operator is used, the degrees of freedom of the standard D2Q9 lattice and D3Q19 lattice, even D3Q27 lattice are not enough to remove the anisotropy [16]. As far as we know, Koelman [17] first proposed a SRT-LB model on a rectangular lattice where a low Mach-number expansion of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is used to obtain the equilibrium distribution function. However, this model fails to recover the correct NSEs with isotropic viscosity when the grid aspect ratio is different from 1. Then, to derive the correct NSEs, several modified rectangular SRT-LB models were proposed. For example, Hegeler et al. [16] developed a rectangular SRT-LB model that can derive the correct macroscopic equations by adding discrete velocity directions to increase degrees of freedom. Peng et al. [18] and Saadat et al. [19] respectively proposed another SRT-LB model on a rectangular grid that can reproduce the correct NSEs by introducing an extended equilibrium distribution function. Besides, Wang et al. [20] constructed a SRT-LB model through including some artificial counteracting forcing terms, which are used to remove the anisotropy caused by the rectangular lattice. We note that these SRT-LB models mentioned above can be regarded as some modifications to the standard SRT-LB model by introducing additional\nvelocity directions, extended equilibrium distribution function or force terms, which may bring more computational cost. Additionally, it is also not flexible enough to adjust the shear and bulk viscosities independently.\nConsidering the fact that compared to the SRT-LB model, the MRT-LB model can provide additional degrees of freedom, another feasible approach is to use the MRT collision model to remove this inconsistency. Under the framework of MRT-LB method, Bouzidi et al. [21] constructed the first MRT-LB model on a two-dimensional rectangular grid. Although this model can obtain the correct results in some numerical tests, the anisotropy problem cannot be overcome completely when the grid aspect ratio does not equal to one [22]. A similar attempt has been made by Zhou [23], however this MRT model on the rectangular lattice cannot correctly recover the NSEs. Through an inverse design analysis based on the Chapman-Enskog expansion, Zong et al. [22] proposed another MRT-LB model on the D2Q9 rectangular grid, in which an additional adjustable parameter that governs the relative orientation in the energy-normal stress subspace is introduced. By adjusting this parameter, this model can correctly recover the macroscopic equations. However, this model is complicated, and is difficult to be extended to other lattice structures. After that, Peng et al. [24] designed an alternative MRT-LB model on a rectangular grid by incorporating stress components into the equilibrium moments to remove the anisotropy in the stress tensor. Based on the work of Peng et al. [24], Wang et al. [25] developed a D3Q19 MRT-LBM model on a general cuboid grid. However, these two models require a relatively complex quasiequilibrium collision step. In addition, Yahia et al. [26] developed a rectangular central-moment MRT-LBM based on a non-orthogonal moment basis, and then extended it to three-dimensional central-moment LBM on a cuboid lattice [27]. The equilibrium to which the central moments relax under collision in this approach is obtained from those corresponding to the continuous Maxwell distribution. These two models involve a relatively complicated computation of the equilibrium moments.\nAlthough the correct macroscopic equations can be derived by introducing artificial source terms, additional adjustable parameter or extended equilibrium distribution function, these treatments are not necessary. Actually, the correct NSEs can be obtained by exploiting the properties of the rectangular MRT model without adding any additional terms. Based on this idea, Zecevic et al. [28] presented a RLB method on two and three-dimensional lattices. They adopted a different set of basis vectors that allows hydrodynamic behaviour to be restored by adjusting relaxation parameters alone. We note that the RMRT model of Zecevic et al. [28] still has some certain limitations.\nFor instance, as stated in Ref. [28], there is no the orthogonal transformation matrix for rD3Q19, thus the RMRT-LB model with rD3Q19 lattice cannot be given [28]. However, the RMRT-LB model with rD3Q19 lattice actually exists. In addition, the equilibrium distribution function and the bulk viscosity in the NSEs are also not considered in Ref. [28].\nIn this work, we intend to construct a general RMRT-LB model for the Navier-Stokes and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations by extending the recent unified framework of standard MRT-LB method [29], and derive a general rectangular equilibrium distribution function proposed by Lu et al. [30] in detail. Here we would like to point out that in most of the RMRT-LB models, the collision process is carried out in the moment space rather than the velocity (distribution function) space, thus the analysis method (e.g., the Chapman-Enskog expansion) is very complicated, and often depends on the specified lattice structure or discrete velocity set. In view of this, we will follow the previous work [29] to conduct the modeling and analysis in the distribution function space, and show that the present model is more general and more natural. For simplicity, we only give some basic elements in the implementation of the RMRT-LB method, including the velocity moments, the weights of different lattice models (e.g., rD2Q9, rD3Q19, and rD3Q27 lattices), the equilibrium, auxiliary and source distribution functions. Through the direct Taylor expansion method, a generalized NSEs with a viscosity tensor can be correctly recovered through properly selecting the relaxation sub-matrix S2, which is related to kinetic viscosity and bulk viscosity. In addition, the present RMRT-LB model would reduce to the unified framework of MRT-LB method [29] with the grid aspect ratio being 1 and sound speed c2s = c 2/3. If the sound speed is taken as an adjustable parameter and the standard lattice is used, the present RMRT-LB method can be considered as a new class of MRT-LB method for the NSEs and CDEs. We would also like to point out that the present RMRT-LB model is a natural extension to the previous work [29], and it does not introduce any assumptions or additional computational steps. Additionally, compared to the available RLB models, the present one is very simple and easy to implement.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the rectangular multiple-relaxationtime lattice Boltzmann method is presented, and the general equilibrium, auxiliary and source distribution functions of RMRT-LB method on the rectangular lattice is given in Sec. III. Then the direct Taylor expansion analysis of present RMRT-LB method is conducted to recover the macroscopic equations in Sec. IV. After that, we present the structure of collision matrix and some special cases of the RMRT-LB method in Sec. V. Finally, some conclusions are summarized in Sec. VI."

F j(x, t) is the DF of a source or forcing\nterm, G j(x, t) is the auxiliary DF, and \u039b = (\u039b jk) is a q\u00d7q invertible collision matrix. \u2206t is the time step, D\u0304 j = \u2202t + \u03b3c j \u00b7 \u2207 with \u03b3 = 1 for NSEs and \u03b3 \u2208 {0, 1} for NCDE. In the evolution equation (1), the key elements, c j, f eq\nj , F j,G j and \u039b, must be given properly.\nThe unknown macroscopic conserved variable(s) \u03c6(x, t) for NCDE, or \u03c1(x, t) and u(x, t) for\nNSEs, are computed by\n\u03c6(x, t) = \u2211\nj\nf j(x, t), (2a)\n\u03c1(x, t) = \u2211\nj\nf j(x, t), u(x, t) = \u2211\nj\nc j f j(x, t)/\u03c1(x, t). (2b)\nThe evolution equation (1) can be divided into two sub-steps, i.e., collision and propagation,\nCollison: f\u0303 j(x, t) = f j(x, t) \u2212 \u039b jk f ne k (x, t) + \u2206t\n[ G j(x, t) + F j(x, t) + \u2206t\n2 D\u0304 jF j(x, t)\n]\n, (3a)\nPropagation: f j(x + c j\u2206t, t + \u2206t) = f\u0303 j(x, t), (3b)\nwhere f\u0303 j(x, t) is the post-collision distribution function.\nAs pointed out in Ref. [29], in almost all of the MRT-LB models, the collision process in Eq. (1) is carried out in the moment space, and the analysis method (e.g., the popular ChapmanEnskog analysis) is usually more complicated and often depends on the specified lattice structure or discrete velocity set [3, 31\u201334]. In this work, we will extend the unified framework of MRT-LB method [29] to that of RMRT-LB method.\nIn the implementation of the RMRT-LB method, there are two popular schemes that can be used to discretize D\u0304 jF j(x, t) in the last term on the right hand side of Eq. (1). Actually, if \u03b3 = 0, the first-order explicit difference scheme \u2202tF j(x, t) = [F j(x, t) \u2212 F j(x, t \u2212 \u2206t)]/\u2206t is adopted for NCDEs [31, 35]. While for the case of \u03b3 = 1, we can use the first-order implicit difference scheme\n(\u2202t + c j \u00b7 \u2207)F j(x, t) = [F j(x + c j\u2206t, t + \u2206t) \u2212 F j(x, t)]/\u2206t for both NCDE and NSEs, and take the transform f\u0304 j = f j \u2212 \u2206t 2 F j as in Refs. [31, 36, 37], then Eq. (1) becomes\nf\u0304 j(x + c j\u2206t, t + \u2206t) = f\u0304 j(x, t) \u2212 \u039b jk f\u0304 ne k (x, t) + \u2206t\n[ G j(x, t) + (\u03b4 jk \u2212 \u039b jk/2)Fk(x, t) ] , (4)\nwhere f\u0304 ne j (x, t) = f\u0304 j(x, t) \u2212 f eq j (x, t). Additionally, we also have the following relations,\n\u2211\nj\nf j(x, t) = \u2211\nj\nf\u0304 j(x, t) + \u2206t\n2\n\u2211\nj\nF j(x, t), (5a)\n\u2211\nj\nc j f j(x, t) = \u2211\nj\nc j f\u0304 j(x, t) + \u2206t\n2\n\u2211\nj\nc jF j(x, t). (5b)\nIt follows from Eqs.

(17d)\nFrom Eqs.

(17), we can derive some special cases of the rD3Q27 lattice model. (1) If we take \u03c919 = 0, the weight coefficients in the rD3Q19 lattice model are obtained. (2) If we take \u03c97 = \u03c911 = \u03c915 = 0, the weight coefficients in the rD3Q15 lattice model and the\nfollowing relations can be obtain,\nc2 s1 c2 1 = c2 s2 c2 2 = c2 s3 c2 3 . (19)\n(3) If we take \u03c91 = \u03c92 = \u03c93 = \u03c919 = 0, the weight coefficients in the rD3Q13 lattice model\nand the following conditions can be derived,\nc2 s1 c2 1 = c2 s2 c2 2 = c2 s3 c2 3 = 1 2 . (20)\nIt can be found from Eqs. (19) and (20) that when cs1 = cs2 = cs3, one can get c1 = c2 = c3,\nwhich implies that there are no rD3Q15 and rD3Q13 lattice models.\nFrom Eqs. (13), (15) and (16), we can give some constraints on the fourth-order moment \u2206(4)\nof discrete velocities on the rDdQq lattice,\n\u2206 (4) \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1 = c 2 \u03b1c 2 s\u03b1,\u2206 (4) \u03b1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2 = \u2206(2)\u03b1\u03b1\u2206 (2) \u03b2\u03b2 = c2s\u03b1c 2 s\u03b2 (\u03b1 , \u03b2),\u2206 (4) \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b8 = 0 (else), (21)\nwhich indicates that it no longer satisfies the isotropic condition on rectangular lattice or on standard lattice with c2s\u03b1 = c 2 s , c 2/3. Here we present its natural expression as the extension to that on the standard lattice:\n\u2206 (4) =< \u2206(2)\u2206(2) > +\u03b4(4), (22)\nwhere\n< \u2206(2)\u2206(2) >\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b8= \u2206 (2)\n\u03b1\u03b2 \u2206\n(2) \u03b3\u03b8 + \u2206(2)\u03b1\u03b3\u2206 (2) \u03b2\u03b8 + \u2206 (2) \u03b2\u03b3 \u2206 (2) \u03b1\u03b8 , (23a)\n\u03b4 (4) \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b8 = c2s\u03b1(c 2 \u03b1 \u2212 3c 2 s\u03b1), \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = \u03b8; \u03b4 (4) \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b8 = 0, else. (23b)\nWhen the relations cs\u03b1 = cs and c 2 \u03b1 = c 2 = 3c2s are satisfied for all \u03b1, one can obtain \u03b4 (4) = 0 and \u2206(4) = c4s\u2206 with \u2206\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b8 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4\u03b3\u03b8 + \u03b4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03b2\u03b8 + \u03b4\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03b8, which means that the fourth-order isotropy can be achieved.\nBased on above analysis and our previous work [30], we now present the REDF with general\nform on a rDdQq lattice, which is an extension of the commonly used one,\ng eq\nj (A,B,M) = \u03c9 j\n( A + c\u0303 j \u00b7 B + Q\u0303 j : M ) , (24)\nwhere\nc\u0303 j\u03b1 = c j\u03b1/c 2 s\u03b1, Q\u0303 j\u03b1\u03b1 = Q j\u03b1\u03b1/(c 2 s\u03b1(c 2 \u03b1 \u2212 c 2 s\u03b1)), Q\u0303 j\u03b1\u03b2 = Q j\u03b1\u03b2/(2c 2 s\u03b1c 2 s\u03b2) (\u03b1 , \u03b2),Q j = c jc j \u2212 \u2206 (2). (25)\nAccording to the properties of rDdQq lattice models, and through some algebra manipulations,\nwe can obtain the basic moments of g eq\nj on rDdQq lattice [30],\n\u2211\nj\ng eq\nj = A,\n\u2211\nj\nc jg eq\nj = B,\n\u2211\nj\nc jc jg eq j = A\u2206(2) +M, (26a)\n\u2211\nj\nc jc jc jg eq j = \u2206(4) \u00b7 B\u0303, (26b)\nwhere B\u0303\u03b1 = B\u03b1/c 2 s\u03b1.\nWith the help of Eq.

For the rD2Q5I lattice, \u03c95 = 0, we have \u03c9\u03b1 = c2s\u03b1\n2c2\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1, 2), while for the rD2Q5II\nlattice, \u03c91 = \u03c92 = 0, we can obtain \u03c95 = c2s\u03b1 4c2\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1, 2) and also c2 s1 c2 1 = c2 s2 c2 2 . For the rD3Q9 lattice, \u03c9\u03b1 = 0 (1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 18), we have \u03c919 = c2s\u03b1 4c2\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3) and c2 s1 c2 1 = c2 s2 c2 2 = c2 s3 c2 3 . For the rD3Q7 lattice, \u03c9\u03b1 = 0 (\u03b1 > 6), we derive \u03c9\u03b1 = c2s\u03b1 2c2\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3). Usually, the linear EDF g eq j (A,B, 0) is used, which satisfies Eq. (26) with M = 0, while \u2206(4) does not satisfy Eq. (21) or Eq.

In Ref. [29], these four methods have been compared, and it is shown that they can give the same equations at the second-order of expansion parameters, while the DTE method is much simpler.

(35) can be considered as a general form of CDEs, and many different kinds of CDEs considered in some previous work [30, 35, 38, 39] are its special cases.\nTo recover Eq.

Additionally, if D is only a function of \u03c6, we can also obtain a local scheme for \u2207\u03c6 from Eq. (39).\nActually, Eq.

In this case, the simpler rDdQ2d or rDdQ(2d + 1) lattice model can be adopted.\nIn addition, we would also like to point out that at the diffusive scaling, the present RMRT-LB\nmodel can be simplified [29], i.e., the term \u2206t 2\n2 D\u0304 jF j(x, t) in the evolution equation [Eq.

(46)\nRemark I: The first-order moment of f ne j , i.e. Efne in Eq. (39) can also be computed by its\ncounterpart (Efne = mne E = mE \u2212m\neq E ) in the moment space.\nRemark II: When K = diag(\u03ba\u03b1) and D = diag(D\u03b1) are diagonal matrices, the term \u03b2c 2 sD in Eq.\n(36b) can also be replaced by diag(\u03b2\u03b1c 2 s\u03b1D\u03b1), and Eq. (37) becomes\n\u03ba\u03b1 = \u2206t(\u03c4 \u2212 1/2)\u03b2\u03b1c 2 s\u03b1, (47)\nwhere S\u221211 = \u03c4I has been used. In this case, the SRT-RLB model can be used for NCDE (35), as shown in Ref. [30].\nRemark III: If c2s , c 2/3 is considered on the standard lattice, the distribution functions f\neq j ,G j\nand F j defined in Eqs. (42), and (43) for NCDE are new, and one get a class of MRT-LB models as the special cases of the present RMRT-LB model with the sound speed c2s as an adjustable parameter ."

(69b)\nIt should be noted that due to its inherent characteristics, the present RMRT-LB model can correctly recover the generalized NSEs [Eq. (67)] and the special case, i.e., Eq. (48). However, the present RMRT-LB method is only suitable for the incompressible or weakly compressible fluid flows since the third-order term in Mach number has been omitted, as discussed above. Finally, we also present a local scheme to calculate shear stress or strain rate tensor in the framework of LB method [32, 42, 43]. From Eqs.

(70) can be neglected, then the following local scheme for shear stress with a second-order accuracy in time can be obtained from Eq. (70)\nK\u00b5(\u2207u + (\u2207u) T ) = \u2212(I \u2212 S2/2)\n\u2211\nk\n[ ckck f ne k + \u2206t\n2 (uF\u0304 + F\u0304u + c2s S\u0304 I)\n]\n, (71)\nwhere S2 is a diagonal matrix with S2,\u03b1\u03b1 = ss\u03b1, and S2,\u03b1\u03b2 = s\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03b1 , \u03b2).\nBased on Eq. (71), one can also give an expression of strain rate tensor with a second-order\naccuracy in time,\n\u2207u + (\u2207u)T\n2 = \u2212(K\u22121\u00b5 /2)(I \u2212 S2/2)\n\u2211\nk\n[ ckck f ne k + \u2206t\n2 (uF\u0304 + F\u0304u + c2s S\u0304 I)\n]\n. (72)\nIt should be noted that if the term uF\u0304 + F\u0304u in Eqs. (60), (71) and (72) are neglected, the much simpler formulas can be obtained with the truncation error O(\u2206t2 + \u2206tMa2).\nIn addition, from Eqs.

(79a) and Eq.

(69) that the RMRT-LB model on rectangular or standard lattice with c2s , c 2/3 does not have the versions of the SRT-LB model and TRT-LB model ( [38]), since there are at least two different relaxation factors related to the second moment of f eq\nj (or to\nthe dynamic viscosity \u00b5). Keep this in mind, we can find that the rectangular MRT-LBM model in Ref. [21] has only one relaxation factor s\u03bd related to the viscosity \u03bd, thus it cannot recover the NSEs (48) correctly.\nRemark III: Even for the standard lattice, if c2s , c 2/3, we can also obtain the new forms of\nf eq\nj ,G j and F j defined in Eqs.

            "text": "As we known, the MRT-LB model can also be analyzed and implemented in moment space. When the discrete velocity set Vq = {c j, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 q \u2212 1} or the rDdQq lattice model is given, we can construct different forms of collision matrix \u039b in the RMRT-LB method (1). In general, the commonly used collision matrix \u039b which satisfies the constraints in Eq. (36) or (50) has the following form [29],\n\u039b =M\u22121SM, (80a)\nS = (Sk j), Sk j = 0 (k < j), Skk = Sk, (80b)\nwhere M is an invertible transformation matrix, whose rows are made up of discrete velocities in Vq, S is a block-lower-triangle matrix, Sk \u2208 R nk\u00d7nk is a relaxation matrix corresponding to the k-th (0 \u2264 k \u2264 m) order moment of discrete velocity.\nGiven a transformation matrix M, let f = ( f0, f1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , fq\u22121) T , feq = ( f\neq 0 , f eq 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , f eq q\u22121 )T , then\none can execute the transformation between velocity space and moment space\nm =Mf,meq =Mfeq, (81)\nor equivalently,\nf =M\u22121m, feq =M\u22121meq. (82)\nUsing Eqs. (80), (81) and (82), the evolution equation of RMRT-LB method (3) can be written\nin a matrix form as follows.\nCollison in moment space: m\u0303(x, t) = m(x, t)\u2212Smne(x, t)+\u2206t [ mG(x, t)+mF(x, t)+ \u2206t\n2 D\u0303mF(x, t)\n]\n,\n(83a)\nPropagation in velocity space: f(x + c j\u2206t, t + \u2206t) =M \u22121m\u0303(x, t), (83b)\nwhere f(x + c j\u2206t, t + \u2206t) = ( f0(x + c0\u2206t, t + \u2206t), f1(x + c1\u2206t, t + \u2206t), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , fq\u22121(x + cq\u22121\u2206t, t + \u2206t)) T , mne = m \u2212 meq,mG = MG,mF = MF,G = (G0,G1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Gq\u22121) T ,F = (F0, F1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Fq\u22121) T , D\u0303 = M\u22121diag(D\u0304 j)M. On the other hand, one can also implement the RMRT-LB method (3) in the velocity space,\nCollison: f\u0303(x, t) =M\u22121(m(x, t) \u2212 Smne(x, t)) + \u2206t [ G(x, t) + F(x, t) + \u2206t\n2 diag(D\u0304 j)F(x, t)\n]\n, (84a)\nPropagation: f(x + c j\u2206t, t + \u2206t) = f\u0303(x, t). (84b)\nSimilarly, the RMRT-LB method (4) can also be conducted as\nf\u0304(x + c j\u2206t, t + \u2206t) =M \u22121[m\u0304(x, t) \u2212 Sm\u0304ne(x, t) + \u2206t(mG(x, t) + (I \u2212 S/2)mF(x, t)) ] , (85)\nwhere f\u0304 = f \u2212 \u2206tF/2, m\u0304 = Mf\u0304, m\u0304ne = m\u0304 \u2212meq.\nFrom Eqs. (1), (3), (83), (84), and (85), we can see that there are two ways to analyze and implement the RMRT-LB method: the way in velocity space and that in moment space. To recover the NSEs (48) or NCDE (35) from the RMRT-LB method, one only needs the basic constraints on the DFs f eq\nj ,G j, F j and the collision matrix \u039b given in Eq. (50) or (36). Therefore, using the first\nway we can analyze the LB models under a unified framework, as shown in Ref. [29]. Compared to the first way, the second one depends on the choice of rDdQq lattice model and the form of the transformation matrix M, and additionally, the equilibrium moment meq also needs to be given properly, which leads to the fact that the modeling and analysis of the MRT-LB models are usually limited to the specified space dimension and lattice structure. This may be one of the main reasons why the RMRT-LB model has not been developed well for a long time. However, the analysis method in moment space enables us to design the equilibrium moment meq (e.g. the inverse design of LB model as in Refs. [18]) more flexibly by selecting the appropriate transformation matrix M, and high-order moments which do not influence the recovery of the macroscopic equation. If necessary, one can obtain the corresponding EDF f eq\nj by taking the inverse transformation (82). It\nshould be noted in this case, the obtained f eq\nj may not have the form as Eq. (42) or (76).\nActually, there are still some key questions in the RMRT-LB method, for example, what are the relationships among different forms of collision matrices? How do we choose a right one? Thanks to the form of collision matrix in Eq. (80), one can answer the first question, while the second one needs to be further studied.\nIt is worth noting that the collision matrices in the commonly used MRT-LB method are of the form in Eq. (80) [29], including the raw (natural) moment, cascaded (central-moment), Hermitemoment, and central-Hermite-moment LB models [45, 46] with orthogonal and nonorthogonal moment basis vectors. In fact, any two of the transformation matrices M and M\u0304 in these MRT-LB models have the following relation,\nM\u0304 = NM, (86)\nand one can write the collision matrices with the form in Eq. (80),\n\u039b = M\u0304\u22121S\u0304M\u0304 = (NM)\u22121S\u0304(NM) =M\u22121SM, (87)\nwhere N is a lower-triangle matrix, S = N\u22121S\u0304N. Therefore, the existing MRT-LB models mentioned above can be considered as the special cases of the present RMRT-LB method. Furthermore, the present RMRT-LB method includes three classes of MRT-LB models:\n(1) The popular MRT-LB models on standard DdQq lattice with c2s = c 2/3 [29]. (2) The MRT-LB models on standard DdQq lattice with c2s , c 2/3. (3) The MRT-LB models on the rectangular rDdQq lattice. Due to the construction of relaxation matrix S in Eq. (80b), and based on Eqs. (86) and (87), we only use the transformation matrix M related to the raw or natural moments in the analysis and implementation of the RMRT-LB model,\nmnmp = \u2211\nj\ncmjxc n jyc\np jz f j,m eq nmp =\n\u2211\nj\ncmjxc n jyc\np jz f eq j ,m, n, p \u2208 {0, 1, 2}, (88)\nwhere mmn = mmn0 and m eq mn = m eq mn0 for the two-dimensional case. The transformation matrix M related to the natural moments in Eq. (88) are composed of {cm jx cn jy c p jz , 0 \u2264 j \u2264 q \u2212 1}.\nDenote M with the following form,\nM = (MT0 , M T 1 , M T 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , M T m) T , Mk \u2208 R nk\u00d7q, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m, (89)\nthen from Eq.

(63) and (64), we can determine the relaxation matrix S2 as\nS2 =\n  S\u0304 (1) 2 0\n0 S\u0304 (2)\n2\n  , (92)\nwith\nS\u0304 (1) 2 = ( S (1) 2 )\u22121 = A \u2212\nAa\u0304bT A\n1 + bT Aa\u0304 , S\u0304\n(2) 2 = ( S (2) 2 )\u22121 = diag(s\u03b1\u03b2)\u03b1<\u03b2, (93)\nwhere A = diag(ss\u03b1), a\u0304 = a/d, a and b are defined in Eq. (64). Note that here the elements {s\u03b1\u03b2}\u03b1>\u03b2 are not contained in S\u03042 (or ( S (2)\n2\n)\u22121 ) since s\u03b1\u03b2 = s\u03b2\u03b1 for \u03b1 , \u03b2.\nFor a particular case Sk j = 0 (k > j), one can obtain\nS = diag(S0, S1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Sm), (94)\nand Eq. (90) would reduce to\nMk\u039b = SkMk, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m, (95)\nwhich can be used to derive the commonly used MRT-LB model [3, 4].\nNote that the matrix M on rDdQq lattice in Eq. (88) can be expressed as M = DM\u0303 with D\nbeing a diagonal matrix. For the rD2Q9 lattice, M\u0303 and D are given by\nM\u0303 =\n  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 \u22121 0 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0 0 1 0 \u22121 1 1 \u22121 \u22121 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 \u22121 1 \u22121 0 0 0 0 0 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 \u22121 \u22121\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n  , (96a)\nD = diag(1, c1, c2, c 2 1, c 2 2, c1c2, c1c 2 2, c 2 1c2, c 2 1c 2 2), (96b)\nand\nmeq =Mfeq = \u03c1 (\n1, u, v, c2s + u 2, c2s + v 2, uv, c2su, c 2 sv, c 2 s(u 2 + v2 + c2s) )T , (97)\nwhere f eq\nj is defined by Eq. (76), while for the He-Luo version [17] with f\neq,HL j = g eq j (\u03c1, \u03c10u, \u03c10uu),\nwe have\nmeq,HL = Mfeq,HL\n= (\n\u03c1, \u03c10u, \u03c10v, c 2 s\u03c1 + \u03c10u 2, c2s\u03c1 + \u03c10v 2, \u03c10uv, c 2 s\u03c10u, c 2 s\u03c10v, c 2 s(\u03c10(u 2 + v2) + c2s\u03c1) )T . (98)\nIt can also be found that the orthogonal transformation matrices MZKA based on the rD2Q9 and rD3Q27 lattices in Ref. [28] have the form of MZKA = NM with N being a lower-triangular matrix, and m eq\nZKA in Ref. [28] can also be obtained as\nm eq\nZKA =MZKAf\neq = Nmeq, (99)\nwith parameters \u03b32 = \u03b35 = \u03b37 = c 4 s , \u03b33 = \u03b34 = c 2 s , \u03b36 = c 6 s . And the diagonal elements in the relaxation matrices SZKA and S are the same, thus Eq. (66) or (69) are satisfied for the transformation matrices of natural moment and orthogonal one in Ref. [28]. In addition, due to the fact that there is no the orthogonal transformation matrix for rD3Q19, as stated in Ref. [28], the RMRT-LB model with rD3Q19 lattice cannot be given [28], while the present RMRT-LB model with rD3Q19 lattice is ready at hand.\nThe relationship between the matrix M in Eq. (88) and that in Ref. [21] is interesting. Let\nc1 = 1, c2 = a in Eq. (96b), the matrix M with Eq. (96) becomes\nMa = DaM\u0303 =\n  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 \u22121 0 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0 0 a 0 \u2212a a a \u2212a \u2212a 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 a2 0 a2 a2 a2 a2 a2 0 0 0 0 0 a \u2212a a \u2212a 0 0 0 0 0 a2 \u2212a2 \u2212a2 a2 0 0 0 0 0 a a \u2212a \u2212a\n0 0 0 0 0 a2 a2 a2 a2\n  , (100a)\nDa = diag(1, 1, a, 1, a 2, a, a2, a, a2), (100b)\nand the orthogonal transformation matrix used in Ref. [21] can be written as\nMBHLL = NBHLLMa =\n  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 \u22121 0 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0 0 a 0 \u2212a a a \u2212a \u2212a \u22122r1 r2 r3 r2 r3 r1 r1 r1 r1 \u22122r4 r5 r6 r5 r6 r4 r4 r4 r4 0 0 0 0 0 a \u2212a a \u2212a 0 \u22122 0 2 0 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0 0 \u22122a 0 2a a a \u2212a \u2212a\n4 \u22122 \u22122 \u22122 \u22122 1 1 1 1\n  , (101a)\nr1 = 1 + a 2, r2 = 1 \u2212 2a 2, r3 = \u22122 + a 2, r4 = \u22121 + a 2, r5 = 2 + a 2, r6 = \u22121 \u2212 2a 2, (101b)\nwhere\nNBHLL =\n \n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u22122a2 \u2212 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 \u22122a2 + 2 0 0 3a2 \u22123/a2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u22122 0 0 0 0 3/a2 0 0 0 0 \u22122 0 0 0 0 3 0 4 0 0 \u22126 \u22126/a2 0 0 0 9/a2\n  . (102)\nThe related equilibrium moments are obtained by\nm eq\nBHLL = MBHLLf\neq = NBHLLMf eq = \u03c1 ( 1, u, v, e\u0304eq, p\u0304eqxx, uv,C1u/2,C2v/2,C3 )T ,\ne\u0304eq = 3(u2 + v2) + 2(3c2s \u2212 r1), p\u0304 eq xx = r4(3r1c 2 s \u2212 2a 2)/a2 + 3(a2u2 \u2212 v2/a2), (103)\nwith\nC1 = 2(3c 2 s\u22122a 2)/a2,C2 = 2(3c 2 s\u22122),C3 = (9c 4 s+9c 2 su 2+9c2sv 2\u22126c2s\u22126v 2)/a2\u2212(6u2+6c2s\u22124). (104)\nNote that C1 and C2 satisfy the following relation,\nC1 = (C2 + 4(1 \u2212 a 2))/a2, (105)\nwhich is same as that in Ref. [21]. When C1 and C2 are taken by Eq. (104), one can find that the equilibrium moments in Eq. (103) are the same as those in Ref. [21] except the fourth moment \u03b5eq which does not affect the correct recovery of the NSEs. This implies that for the RMRT-LB model in Ref. [21], one can correctly recover the NSEs (48) when choosing the relaxation sub-matrix S\u03042 corresponding to S2 in Eq. (92). It can be seen from Eq. (92) or (69) that in two-dimensional case up to five different relaxation parameters are generally used to determine the dynamic shear viscosity \u00b5 and the dynamic bulk viscosity \u00b5b, three for \u00b5 and two for \u00b5b, while at most three relaxation parameters (s2, s8, and s9) were used in Ref. [21], two for \u00b5 and one for \u00b5b."

            "text": "In this work, following our recent work [29], we developed a general framework of the RMRTLB method on the rDdQq lattice for the NCDE and NSEs in a natural and unified way, in which\na block-lower-triangular-relaxation matrix is used. At first, the rectangular rDdQq lattice models, the properties of velocity moments and the expression of weight coefficients are discussed, and a general REDF is obtained based on the work in Ref. [30]. Then we conducted a detailed DTE analysis on the present RMRT-LB method, and a generalized NSEs with anisotropic viscosity (viscosity tensor) can be correctly recovered, while the analysis of the RMRT-LB method for NCDE is omitted since it is the same as that in Ref. [29]. It should be noted that if the isotropic viscosity is considered, the popular NSEs will be recovered. Further, the structure of the collision matrix in the RMRT-LB method is analyzed, and we find that some existing MRT-LB models can be viewed as the special cases of the present RMRT-LB method, including the classical MRT-LB model, central-moment LB model, Hermite-moment and central-Hermite-moment LB models. In addition, two new versions of those MRT-LB models with third-order anisotropic moments: one on standard DdQq lattice with c2s , c 2/3, and the other on rectangular rDdQq lattice where the rectangular MRT-LB model in Ref. [28] is only a special case."
