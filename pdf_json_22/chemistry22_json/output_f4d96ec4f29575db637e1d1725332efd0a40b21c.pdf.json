New regions of this chemical space can, nevertheless, be accessed by generating structures that do not occur in nature or by modifying naturally-occurring polysaccharide structures \u2013 collectively, termed new polysaccharides (NPs). Two synthetic routes to NPs are described; the de novo route, directly from monosaccharide starting materials and the functionalization route, involving glycosylation of existing polysaccharides. The reaction involves a simple condensation step under microwave heating, catalysed by environmentally benign organic acids and is illustrated by the generation of structures with biological activities ranging from cell signalling and inhibition of bacterial growth, to mimicking carbohydrate antigens of pathogenic microorganisms. The method is as applicable to fine chemicals as it is to industrial waste, for example, biotechnologically-derived D-allulose (D-psicose), or the waste products of biofermentation.

            "text": "Polysaccharides are some of the largest and most complex macromolecules as well as the most abundant. They perform essential biological roles in every kingdom of life. For instance, the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells of all mammals contains the complex glycan, heparan sulfate (HS), which has staggering potential complexity; an octasaccharide sequence offering thousands of hypothetical permutations, and its improper formation is embryonically lethal.1 The surfaces of many bacterial cells are also coated in glycans which form capsules known to protect the bacteria from viral entry and help defend their host against viral infection, whilst complex bacterial communities produce carbohydrate-rich biolms contributing to antibiotic resistance, enabling their persistence in unfavourable environments. The cell walls of plants consist of a variety of complex glycans and themost abundant molecule in the biosphere is cellulose, a homopolymer of b1,4 linked Dglucose, forming the primary constituent of secondary cell walls and providing plants much of their structural rigidity.\niology, ISMIB, University of Liverpool, .ac.uk mation (ESI) available. See\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nAdditionally, plant primary cell walls contain a complex variety of hemicellulose, pectins, rhamnogalactans and others2,3 whose coordinated modication enable growth and provide both support and exibility.\nMankind has long isolated and re-purposed naturally occurring complex glycans for \u2018non-natural\u2019 uses of technological and societal value. Currently, cellulose is employed in ltration and dialysis membranes; the hemicellulose, xyloglucan, is used in industrial surfactants; the HS-like glycan, heparin, whose biological role is still not fully understood, is exploited as a major anticoagulant drug and the polysaccharides xanthan gum, carrageenan and gum arabic (from bacterial, algal and plant sources, respectively) nd applications that include use as thickeners for food. Purication of such polysaccharides can involve signicant effort and natural batchto-batch variation also presents challenges to product consistency, thus, approaches that enable biotechnologically relevant complex carbohydrates to be accessed which are both economically viable and reproducible, would be desirable.\nDespite the diverse and essential roles that complex carbohydrates serve in nature, and their considerable industrial value through deliberate re-purposing, the sequence and conformational landscape of complex carbohydrates that are explored by nature is, in fact, very small in comparison to that which is hypothetically available. Complex carbohydrates comprise more\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 11075\u201311083 | 11075\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 0\n8 A\npr il\n20 22\n.

Even ignoring other potential modications, such as phosphorylation, sulfation and acetylation, this complexity provides this class of molecule much more structural variety than is available to proteins. Just as in proteins, however, structure is related intimately to the function of the molecule, and can be nely adjusted through subtle structural changes.\nAccessing more of this unexplored sequence and conformational carbohydrate space would provide new polysaccharides (NPs) that do not exist in nature, with unique chemical and physical properties of potential value. Documented approaches have been reported for the synthesis of polysaccharides starting from the reaction of suitably protected intermediate glycosyl donor and acceptor molecules,4 as well as reports of pseudo-polysaccharides with hybrid or unnatural linkages (e.g. amines, orthoesters and carbamates),5 and also those that employ ring opening polymerisation.6 The use of protected donors and acceptors, however, can be expensive and time consuming, and is usually restricted to the synthesis of oligosaccharides.\nThe approach adopted here to generate NPs is the acidcatalysed condensation of simple sugars. This reaction has a long history and is based on Emil Fischer's 1895 acid catalysed formation of methyl glycosides from monosaccharides and methanol,7 then polysaccharides,8 and which was later adapted to employ catalysts such as phosphoric acid.8,9 These approaches have subsequently been adapted further10,11 and here, we apply microwave heating to drive the condensation of simple, unprotected sugars to generate a series of exemplar NPs (Fig. 1), catalyzed by environmentally benign organic acids, such as citric acid, and explore their potential in a range of biological assays. This approach avoids the environmentally damaging metal salts, such as tin or zinc chlorides and silver triate of some conventional Lewis acid catalysed glycosylations, and can generate NPs of several kDa within minutes. The NPs formed can then be puried easily by dialysis or gel permeation chromatography before processing for analysis or downstream applications. The approach generates polysaccharides following the most favourable thermodynamic route and foregoes formal control over regio- and stereoselectivity. The properties of the resulting NPs can still be inuenced to some extent through the choice of the initial reactants and their complexity can be increased by conducting repeated rounds of synthesis introducing varied reactants. It should be noted, however, that the primary goal in this initial exploration is to create de novo NPs which do not exist in nature and whose biological activities, or biotechnological applications, are initially unknown, thus, the generation of predetermined structures is not a formal aim.\nFurthermore, in addition to the de novo approach, a functionalisation approach can be adopted. Existing polysaccharides can be modied using this second route to alter their properties. The starting material for functionalisation could vary from\n11076 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 11075\u201311083\nexisting materials with the aim of modifying their properties, to waste materials such as those sourced from biotechnological processes (e.g. biofuel reactors) with the aim of generating products with useful activities and, hence, added value.\nWe describe the application of microwave induced acidcatalysed condensation to generate NPs through both routes. We demonstrate that, without further optimization, de novo polysaccharides exhibit diverse biological activities that include inuencing bacterial biolm formation, acting as mimetics of tuberculosis arabinans and of epitopes on the cell surface of parasites. Illustrating the functionalisation route, chondroitin sulfate that has been fucosylated and chemically sulfated, inhibits cell growth in the presence of heparin-dependent growth factors. These data demonstrate that NPs are not biologically inert and can interact with biological systems in new ways. New polysaccharides can be produced quickly, simply, and the method is amenable to operating at scale. Thus, NPs have enormous potential to drive an expansion in the use of complex carbohydrates in both biological and industrial settings, utilising a simple, rapid and environmentally-friendly synthetic process.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

            "text": "formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), an opportunistic pathogen, is responsible for infection in vulnerable individuals and is particularly common in clinical settings. For instance, P. aeruginosa contamination of medical devices is a widespread problem, and can cause pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, as well as persistent infections of the lungs of cystic brosis sufferers. Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibits extensive drug resistance and is also able to form biolms, presenting additional resistance to drug treatment and cleaning procedures. Biolms are complex structures containing polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, that are able to adhere to the surfaces of tissues and implanted devices and thereby form an environment that protects the bacteria from both antibiotics and the immune system of the host, as well as providing a site in which other bacteria may become resident.12\nTo investigate the use of NPs as novel reagents in disrupting biolm formation we employed the de novo synthetic route to generate several NPs, each using a simple sugar (D-galactose, Larabinose, L-rhamnose, D-glucose, D-arabinose and D-mannose respectively) as the building block catalyzed by citric acid and formed complex, branched polymers typically of 5 kDa. These were added at a concentration of 100 mg mL 1 to bacterial cell cultures of P. aeruginosa, and the effect on biolm formation monitored using a crystal violet-based method of biolm detection.13 The effects on biolm formation of P. aeruginosa by the NPs was varied; the D-galactose NP caused a ca. 36% reduction in biolm formation, while others reduced biolm formation less dramatically (L-arabinose, L-rhamnose and Dglucose NPs) or not at all (D-arabinose and D-mannose NPs) (Fig. 2). The mechanisms behind the action of these NPs, which have not been optimized, are unknown, but the potential utility is clear.\nPoly D-arabinose NPs are recognised by antilipoarabinomannan (LAM) polysaccharide antibodies\nThe review by Peltier et al.14 summarizes over y polysaccharides from microorganisms that contain both pyranose and furanose ring forms of hexoses. Of these, about one third were recognized as playing a role in pathogenic processes and included major disease-causing genera such as Mycobacterium, Shigella and Trypanosoma.

Some of the structures formed are likely to resemble naturally occurring sequences, while others are expected to be new.\nIn Mycobacterium tuberculosis, two polysaccharides with immune-modulatory properties predominate; lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and arabinogalactan (AG), which both contain furanose ring forms. In the branched LAM polysaccharide, b (1-6) and b (1-5) linked D-galactofuranose, as well as b D-arabinofuranose, have been identied.15\u201317 Structures comprising these furanose ring forms are of particular interest, since they are not found inmammals and thus they could act, or be modied to act, as potential enzyme inhibitors against mycobacterial transferases or, as a source of antigenic structures to prime the immune system. The LAM structures include terminal sections that represent epitopes responsible for the antibody response evident commonly in mycobacterial infections.17 The availability of an anti-LAM antibody, used as a diagnostic for the disease, offers the possibility of identifying epitopes based on D-arabinose rapidly, for future exploitation, using the de novo synthetic route. To this end, an NP was produced from D-arabinose and the ability of the NP to compete with binding of the antibody to the positive control, was demonstrated (Fig. 3). This D-arabinose NP was also subjected to analysis by NMR which conrmed its complex structure, comprising anomeric linkages of both a and b pyranose and furanose ring forms (Fig. 4).\nNMR revealed signals for both free primary hydroxyl groups and those linked by glycosidic bonds, evident in the HSQC spectrum with 13C chemical shis around 64 ppm and 69\u2013 70 ppm respectively.18 The analysis highlights the complexity of the NP products formed, even from a single starting sugar, in this case revealing both a and b D-arabinose in both furanose and pyranose forms.19 Measurement of one (1JCH) and three\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 11075\u201311083 | 11077\nFig. 3 Novel polysaccharides generated from D-arabinose can act as mimics of lipoarabinomannan from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Following bites by ticks, a (1-3) D-galactose disaccharides can also be the source of acquired allergy to meat in the diet. It has been suggested that the loss of a-D-galactose biosynthetic capability in humans and apes, which occurred 28 million years ago, bestowed a selective advantage by providing immunogenic protection against a number of pathogens (discussed in ref. 22).\nHere, the de novo synthesis route was used to generate NPs with potential utility in these applications, and the detection of a D-gal epitopes was demonstrated using a lectin from Griffonia simplicifolia with high affinity for a linked D-galactose units (Fig. 5).\nNew polysaccharides from a biotechnologically-derived starting material, D-allulose The approach also provides a route to generate NPs from biotechnologically-derived starting materials and can include those produced from rare or novel monosaccharides. An\nexample is provided by the condensation of D-allulose (D-psicose), the C-3 epimer of D-fucose, which is used as a low-calorie dietary sweetener, and is found only very rarely in nature. DAllulose is produced on a large scale by biotechnological approaches,23 however, and the de novo route generates NPs with potentially novel attributes that presumably include polysaccharide structures to which existing carbohydrate degrading enzymes have never been exposed. D-Allulose was condensed using two different organic acid catalysts, citric (pKa(1) 3.1) and cis-aconitic (a dehydrated derivative of citric acid, pKa(1) 2.8) acids. The NP produced with citric acid catalysis exhibited a molecular weight by viscosity measurements against dextran standards of ca. 5.3 kDa, while that of the cis-aconitic acid catalyst was lower, at ca. 4 kDa (Table 1).\nGeneration of a fucosylated glycosaminoglycan via functionalisation and its subsequent sulfation enabled modulation of FGF cell signaling\nFinally, we illustrate the generation of a NP made by the functionalisation route. As an example, L-fucose was reacted with an existing polysaccharide, the glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin-4sulfate (chondroitin sulfate-A), followed by an O-sulfation step and the sulfated product was tested for its ability to compete against heparin in a cell-based assay of signalling.

The BaF cell line is devoid of endogenous heparan sulfate, which is the obligatory co-receptor in FGF-FGFR tyrosine kinase driven cell signalling,24 and cells were transfected with a single, selected FGFR (FGFR1c), then cultured in the presence of a chosen FGF (FGF-1) together with heparin which served as the positive control. The test NP, chemically sulfated fucosylated-CS-A, was then co-incubated under these conditions as a potential inhibitor and its ability to compete the cell proliferation capability of the FGF-heparin combination was determined (Fig. 6).\nThe FGF-driven coordination of wound and nerve repair as well as developmental processes, are all areas of extensive research. Derivatisation of existing materials such as GAGs, many of which have already found application in practical devices, offer a direct means of further tailoring their properties."

            "text": "The number of hypothetical sequence arrangements of the amino acids that comprise a typical protein is vast, but it is not appreciated so widely that this complexity is dwarfed by the possible variation provided by carbohydrates of much shorter lengths. Complex carbohydrates full numerous, varied and essential roles throughout nature, indeed, the emergence of eukaryotic life closely tracks the emergence and complexity of sulfated glycans at the cell surface.25 Despite this, to facilitate life, nature has only tapped into a small subset of the plethora of complex glycans that potentially could be generated. Furthermore, mankind utilises this limited source of naturally occurring glycans for a wide range of uses for which they did not evolve. This leads to the tantalizing speculation as to what could be achieved were the vast chemical and conformational space of complex carbohydrates to be explored more comprehensively.\nAmong the immediately applicable uses would be the generation of NPs to replace existing polysaccharides for which purication and natural variation issues arise. For example, xyloglucan, which can be used in surfactants26 is known to vary from batch to batch depending on the source,27 necessitating regular optimisation of processes. It would be feasible to generate NPs with similar properties from either the same sugar building blocks as xyloglucan, or from others bearing no obvious relation, but that yielded a polymer exhibiting similar or enhanced properties. The use of polysaccharides as food thickeners is another area in which NPs, could readily provide replacement polysaccharides and thereby avoid timeconsuming methods of purication, whether the polysaccharides in current use originate from marine, terrestrial, or bacterial sources. For example, the extraction of xylan from terrestrial plants is known to alter the structure of the original material under highly alkaline conditions, by removing acetyl and ferulic acid groups.28,29 For some applications, these groups need to be replaced chemically. Again, by beginning to explore carbohydrate chemical space through microwave assisted acidcatalysed condensation, it may be possible to generate\n11080 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 11075\u201311083\nsubstitutes for xylan with similar properties in a more environmentally responsible manner.\nThe generation of NPs that contain entirely new structures, such as those from D-allulose raises a further interesting possibility. This is to test both the degree to which extant enzymes are specic and to explore the possibility of evolving new enzymes experimentally that are capable of degrading such new structures, for example, using bacterial polysaccharide degrading enzymes. Two types of potential substrate can be envisaged. The rst comprises NPs made from naturally occurring monosaccharides whose polysaccharides contain both naturally occurring and alien polymerised structures, while the second employs an unnatural or very rare sugar, such as D-allulose, to generate polysaccharides that have never been encountered in nature. This would provide an experimental regime under which the evolution of carbohydrate active enzymes could be monitored with dened materials, providing insights into how new carbohydrate active enzymes evolve.\nThe ability to inhibit biolm formation could provide a role for optimised NPs as a protective coating on surfaces and devices but, those able to support biolm formation could be used in a sacricial role or perhaps even to promote biolm formation at a location of choice should this be desirable. The ability of P. aeruginosa to evolve to the effects of a NP would also be much reduced compared to antibiotics, as the genetic tools to degrade these NPs do not exist in nature. Should resistance begin to develop, the ability to either generate new NPs or functionalise existing ones is a rapid process.\nThe biological activities of the NPs generated in this work serve as a proof of principle and required no optimisation to demonstrate their biological functions; there is, therefore, no question whether newly generated NPs will have biological and industrial applications but, rather, what those will (or could) be. Several general routes by which the structures of NPs could be inuenced include the timed addition of reactants with contrasting properties, for example, adding a charged sugar to an already formed branched but neutral scaffold, or the deliberate manipulation of equilibrium composition, exploiting the relatively rapid equilibration of furanose and pyranose forms or their slower anomerisation, or manipulation through pH, and the use of cations. Some control over the degree of branching, the use of conventionally protected sugars can also be envisaged to provide initial scaffolds for polymerisation. This would enable, for example, NPs with some pre-designed characteristics to be synthesized.\nDespite its origin in a reaction that harks back to the early days of carbohydrate chemistry, microwave assisted acid catalysed condensation offers a rapid, facile method for beginning to explore the enormous untapped potential of carbohydrate sequence and conformational space. Starting from widelyavailable simple sugars and employing environmentally benign catalysis, it promises new materials, some of which will be able to replace current chemicals in products such as cosmetics, as well as generating new materials with completely novel functionality.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The mixture was microwaved (medium\u2013high power (4 min) followed by high power (1 additional minute)) in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The thick syrup, oen exhibiting colouration ranging from very pale yellow to dark brown, was then allowed to cool and was re-dissolved in water (10 mL), dialysed against water (2 L, 3.5 kDa cut-off) and dried by rotary evaporation before further analysis by NMR and other physicochemical techniques, or use in biological assays.
