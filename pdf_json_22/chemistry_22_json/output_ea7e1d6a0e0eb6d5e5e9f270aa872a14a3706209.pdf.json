To further optimize the clinically established radiopharmaceutical PSMA-617, novel PSMA ligands for prostate cancer endoradiotherapy were developed. A series of PSMA binding tracers that comprise a benzyl group at the chelator moiety were obtained by solid-phase synthesis. The compounds were labeled with 68Ga or 177Lu. Competitive cell-binding assays and internalization assays were performed using the cell line C4-2, a subline of the PSMA positive cell line LNCaP (human lymph node carcinoma of the prostate). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted in a C4-2 tumor bearing BALB/c nu/nu mouse model. All 68Ga-labeled ligands were stable in human serum over 2 h; 177Lu-CA030 was stable over 72 h. The PSMA ligands revealed inhibition potencies [Ki] (equilibrium inhibition constants) between 4.8 and 33.8 nM. Thepercentage of internalization of the injected activity/106 cells of 68Ga-CA028, 68Ga-CA029, and 68Ga-CA030 was 41.2 \u00b1 2.7, 44.3 \u00b1 3.9, and 53.8 \u00b1 5.4, respectively; for the comparator 68Ga-PSMA-617, 15.5 \u00b1 3.1 was determined. Small animal PET imaging of the compounds showed a high tumor-to-background contrast. Organ distribution studies revealed high specific uptake in the tumor, that is, approximately 34.4 \u00b1 9.8% of injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at 1 h post injection for 68Ga-CA028. At 1 h p.i., 68Ga-CA028 and 68GaCA030 demonstrated lower kidney uptake than 68Ga-PSMA-617, but at later time points, kidney time\u2013activity curves converge. In line with the preclinical data, first diagnostic PET imaging using 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga-CA030 revealed high-contrast detection of bone and lymph node lesions in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. The novel PSMA ligands, in particular CA028 and CA030, are promising agents for targeting PSMA-positive tumor lesions as shown in the preclinical evaluation and in a first patient, respectively. Thus, clinical translation of 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga/177Lu-CA030 for diagnostics and endoradiotherapy of prostate cancer in larger cohorts of patients is warranted.\nKeywords: PSMA, prostate cancer, PET imaging, endoradiotherapy, chelator\nEdited by: Simone Brogi,\nUniversity of Pisa, Italy\nReviewed by: Klaus Schom\u00e4cker,\nUniversity Hospital of Cologne, Germany\nElif Hindie, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux, France\n*Correspondence: Walter Mier\nwalter.mier@med.uni-heidelberg.de\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to Medicinal and Pharmaceutical\nChemistry, a section of the journal Frontiers in Chemistry\nReceived: 17 March 2022 Accepted: 15 June 2022 Published: 09 August 2022\nCitation: dos Santos JC, Sch\u00e4fer M,\nBauder-W\u00fcst U, Beijer B, Eder M, Leotta K, Kleist C, Meyer J-P,\nDilling TR, Lewis JS, Kratochwil C, Kopka K, Haberkorn U and Mier W\n(2022) Refined Chelator Spacer Moieties Ameliorate the Pharmacokinetics of PSMA-617.

            "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
            "text": "The levels of the cell surface receptor prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) are correlated with the stage and grade of prostate carcinoma (Silver et al., 1997; Milowsky et al., 2007; Morris et al., 2007). While increased expression of PSMA implies cancer progression (Yao and Bacich, 2006; Yao et al., 2010) and, most importantly, PSMA is significantly overexpressed on malignant prostate cancer cells as compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia and normal prostatic and other tissues and was even found to be upregulated after androgendeprivation therapy, PSMA has been proven a valuable target for molecular imaging and treatment of metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (Chen et al., 2011; Barrett et al., 2013; Zechmann et al., 2014; Afshar-Oromieh et al., 2015a; Afshar-Oromieh et al., 2015b; Kratochwil et al., 2016; Schmidkonz et al., 2018).\nIn recent years, several PSMA-targeting radiotracers such as 123I-MIP-1095 (Hillier et al., 2009), 99mTc-MIP-1404 (Schmidkonz et al., 2018), 68Ga-PSMA-11 (Eder et al., 2012), 68Ga-PSMA I&T (Weineisen et al., 2015), 68Ga-PSMA-617 (Afshar-Oromieh et al., 2015a), 18F-DCFBC (Turkbey et al., 2017), 18F-DCFPyL (Chen et al., 2011), and 18F-PSMA-1007 (Cardinale et al., 2017) were found to provide higher detection rates in comparison to 11C- and 18F-choline (Hodolic, 2010) diagnostics. Among them, the urea-based peptidomimetic inhibitors showed ideal targeting properties (Eder et al., 2012; Benesova et al., 2015), whereas currently 68Ga-PSMA-11 is one of the most relevant tracers for detecting, staging, and restaging of recurrent lesions and for monitoring the course of treatment of mCRPC (Eder et al., 2012). However, the fact that N,N\u2032-bis [2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]-ethylenediamine-N,N\u2032-diacetic acid (HBED-CC), the chelator within PSMA-11, does not form stable chelate complexes with the most relevant therapeutic radionuclides greatly limits its use as a theranostic agent.\nIn contrast, the compound PSMA-617 contains the chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), which is routinely chosen if labeling with both diagnostic (e.g., 44Sc, 67/68Ga, 111In) and therapeutic radionuclides (e.g., 90Y, 177Lu) is intended (Price and Orvig, 2014). Also, other ligands labeled with beta-emitters, for example, 131I-MIP-1095 (Zechmann et al., 2014), 177Lu-PSMA I&T (Weineisen et al., 2015; Yusufi et al., 2021), and 90Y-/213Bi-PSMA-617 (Benesova et al., 2015; Sathekge et al., 2017), were found to be promising compounds for therapy of mCRPC. Nevertheless, PSMA-617 bearing the linker moieties 2-naphthylL-alanine and 4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid still presents the standard reference regarding pharmacokinetics and internalization (Benesova et al., 2015; Benesova et al., 2016). Furthermore, DOTA tracers are also appropriate for labeling with some \u03b1-emitting isotopes, such as 225Ac and 213Bi. Until now, 225Ac-PSMA-617 is considered to be the compound to deliver the highest cumulative dose (McDevitt et al., 2001; Miederer et al., 2008; Wadas et al., 2014). As 225Ac decays though various pathways, themselves producing radioactive daughter nuclides, internalization is of special interest for 225Ac-therapy. Thus, novel ligands that offer increased internalization into tumor cells would present an advantage due to higher accumulation of\nradioactivity within the cell and prolonged retention of radioactive daughter nuclides. Therefore, the present study was focused on further optimization of PSMA-617. The preclinical characterization of four newly developed PSMA-617 analogues is described (Figure 1). For this purpose, derivatives of PSMA617 with modified lipophilic properties were designed. Compounds containing aromatic building blocks were found to improve its properties; in particular, a benzyl residue placed within the lipophilic pocket of PSMA triggered cellular internalization and caused favorable pharmacokinetics by reducing the amount of tracer within the kidneys (Liu et al., 2008; Kularatne et al., 2009; Eder et al., 2012)."

(Benesova et al., 2015). In brief, triphosgene was used in the first step of the synthesis for the formation of the isocyanate of the glutamyl moiety. A resinimmobilized (applying 2-chlorotrityl resin; Iris Biotech) \u03b5allyloxycarbonyl-protected lysine was reacted for 16 h. This resulted in the allyloxycarbony-protected urea binding motif. The allyloxycarbonyl-protecting group was cleaved after filtration of the resin. The respective chelator was attached to the resin previously linked to Fmoc-2-naphthylalanine and trans4-(Fmoc-aminomethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (see below). The final compound was cleaved from the solid support and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry. Subsequently, the compounds were purified by preparative HPLC. Using a linear gradient elution from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water to 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile, the compounds were separated on a Chromolith\u00ae SemiPrep-column (Merck). The desired products were analyzed by HPLC with the eluent system described above within 5 min on aMonolith RP HPLC column (100 \u00d7 3 mm;Merck) and by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Finally, the product fractions were pooled and lyophilized."

Both procedures furnished consistent and reproducible results. The percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) was calculated, and the resulting values were plotted as a function of time. A biexponential decay curve was used as a fit function, accounting for a short blood half-life (a-phase) during the initial phase directly after injection and a longer blood half-life during the terminal phase (b-phase). The data analysis program Prism 7\u2122 was used to determine both halflives, t1/2-a and t1/2-b, as well as their relative contribution (in%) to the overall half-life (t1/2). Subsequently, both half-lives were weighed according to their relative contribution to the overall blood half-life t1/2. At the time of tracer injection (t = 0), it was assumed that %ID/ g = 50.

Dynamic PET scans were performed 0\u201360 min p.i., and images were reconstructed in three time frames of 20 min (0\u201320 min, 20\u201340 min, and 40\u201360 min) for visual display. A static PET scan was generated at 1 h post injection. The mean SUVs were plotted over time in order to compare the different radiotracers."

            "text": "The results of the Ki determination revealed nanomolar binding affinities of the synthesized ligands to PSMA. As shown in Table 2, among all new compounds, CA030 revealed the highest affinity to PSMA, followed by CA029 and CA028. CA027, which contains none of the two linkers, had the lowest affinity to PSMA.\nThe lipophilicity of the spacer is probably the key factor of highly efficient PSMA binders that follow the basic concept [urea motif]\u2014[spacer]\u2014[chelating moiety]. The lipophilicity accounts for the efficiency of PSMA-617 as compared to alternative tracers. On the other hand, the PSMA-tracer interaction is a multifactorial interaction, which has to take further interactions in vivo into account.\nThe straightforward further increase of the lipophilicity, as performed in albumin binding PSMA tracers, did not lead to compounds with an overall improvement.\nAs the compounds were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC, an alternative measure for lipophilicity as compared to octanol water partition coefficients, this hypothesis could be checked. In general, the affinity goes along with the lipophilicity. However, the fact that CA029 to CA030 show similar retention times, while CA030 has a significantly improved affinity, shows the limit of this factor.\nMoreover, the data were analyzed with respect to a possible correlation between the distances between the urea motif and the chelating moiety. This may be part of the multifactorial interaction of the tracers as the spacer length accounts for the positioning of the lipophilic moiety of the spacer with respect to the anticipated lipophilic binding site in the binding pocket. As a\nprecise prediction of the intramolecular distance would require complex NMR analyses or molecular modeling studies, the number of atoms does provide a reasonable estimation of the spacer length. In contrast to the dependency observed for the lipophilicity, the spacer length did not turn out to provide a clear correlation to the affinity.\nWith the exception of 68Ga-CA027, the novel compounds showed higher specific internalization in C4-2 cells than the reference, for example, 53.78% ID/106 cells for CA030 vs. 15.6% ID/106 cells for PSMA-617 (Table 2).\nThe stability of the compounds radiolabeled with 68Ga and 177Lu was studied in human serum. As indicated by HPLC and radio-ITLC, the 68Ga-labeled compounds did not show degradation after incubation for 2 h in human serum. In contrast to 177Lu-CA029, 177Lu-CA030, and the reference compound 177Lu-PSMA-617, which showed no release of 177 Lu, analysis of 177Lu-CA028 revealed 40% of free activity at this time point (Supplementary Figure S1).\nIn Vivo and Ex Vivo Experiments The metabolization of 177Lu-CA028 in vivo was studied in comparison with 177Lu-PSMA-617 by radio-HPLC analysis. Radio-HPLC chromatograms of extracts from the kidney, blood, liver, and tumor confirmed that the activity elutes at the retention time of the intact tracer (Supplementary Figure S2). Therefore, the integrity of the complex of both ligands is proven within the main in vivo distribution period. The time\u2013activity curves and the mean SUV body weight values generated from the dynamic PET imaging of 68Ga-CA028 1 h p.i. demonstrated a tumor-to-kidney ratio of 2.08 (Supplementary Figure S3). At 2 h p.i., this ratio was increased to 2.69 (Figure 3; Supplementary Table S1), while the ligands 68Ga-CA029 and 68Ga-CA030 showed lower tumorto-kidneys ratios of 0.52 and 0.33, respectively (Figure 3, Supplementary Figures S4, S5).\nTABLE 1 | Analytic data of the novel ligands.\nCompound Ki (nM) Specific cell surface (%IA/106cells)\nSpecific lysate (%IA/106\ncells)\nCA027 33.82 \u00b1 2.13 2.18 \u00b1 0.50 1.70 \u00b1 0.24 CA028 15.17 \u00b1 6.11 94.12 \u00b1 2.70 41.22 \u00b1 2.72 CA029 11.04 \u00b1 4.87 46.83 \u00b1 3.07 44.26 \u00b1 3.96 CA030 4.79 \u00b1 1.31 43.46 \u00b1 1.50 53.78 \u00b1 5.45 PSMA-617 2.34 \u00b1 2.94 45.18 \u00b1 3.61 15.55 \u00b1 3.07\nData are mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3).\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org August 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 8986926\nThe time\u2013activity curves revealed a fast clearance of the tracer\u201468Ga-CA028 showed a high tumor accumulation and high kidney values. In contrast, for 68Ga-CA027, a faster clearance by the kidney at a tumor accumulation was found (Figure 3). Even though 68Ga-CA030 demonstrated higher kidney uptake values than 68Ga-CA028, it showed the highest tumor uptake among all compounds (Figure 4B). Therefore, 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga-CA030 were chosen for detailed investigation. The small animal PET images in Figure 3A demonstrated a very fast kidney clearance and low tumor accumulation of 68Ga-CA027. Distinctly, the radiotracers 68Ga-CA028, 68Ga-CA029, and 68Ga-CA030\nshowed high tumor accumulation (Figure 4B). 68Ga-CA029 showed the highest kidney uptake, followed by 68Ga-CA030 (Figure 4A). In order to analyze the pharmacokinetic parameters such as circulation time of the tracer in the blood, the plasma half-life determination of 68Ga-CA027 and 68Ga-CA028, the tracers with the lowest kidney uptake, was performed. 68Ga-CA027 showed a comparably short plasma half-life of t1/2 = 2.7 min, and\n68Ga-CA028 showed a longer circulation with t1/2 = 5.2 min (Supplementary Figure S4).\nThe results obtained for the biodistribution of the promising PSMA ligands 68Ga-CA028 (Figure 5; Supplementary Table S2)\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org August 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 8986927\nand 68Ga-CA030 (Supplementary Figure S4) are in line with the PET imaging. The graphics (Figure 5, Supplementary Figure S5) show the organ distribution at the time points of 20 min and 1, 2,\nand 4 h p.i. For 68Ga-CA028, a tumor uptake of 12.53 \u00b1 0.45 %ID/ g 20 min after injection was observed. 1 h p.i., the amount of the tracer accumulation in the tumor was higher than that in the kidneys. The specificity of the binding to PSMA was proven with a blockade experiment: co-injection of non-labeled PSMA-617 [2 mg/kg] led to a strong decrease of accumulated 68Ga-CA028 in C4-2 tumors (34.46 \u00b1 9.76 %ID/g to 1.31 \u00b1 0.34 %ID/g) and in the kidneys (15.58 \u00b1 2.79 %ID/g to 2.37 \u00b1 0.52 %ID/g) 1 h p.i. (Figure 6).\nPSMA-PET/CT of Prostate Cancer Patients and Imaging of 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga-CA030 In order to prove the clinical applicability of 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga-CA030, PET/CT imaging in first patients was performed. The resulting images are illustrated in Figures 7, 8. The imaging with 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga-CA030 confirmed the results obtained in vitro and in the animal models. The PET scans and the SUVs were acquired with standard scanner settings, calibrated for pure positron emitters (23). The SUV values obtained at 1 versus 3 h p.i. are presented in Table 3. As reflected by these values, a high and stabile accumulation in the tumor is achieved.\nThe main purpose of this study was the synthesis, the preclinical development, and a first clinical proof of novel 68Ga/177Lu-labeled PSMA ligands. The rationale for the design was the improvement of the linker of PSMA-617. The novel compounds comprise the Lys-NH-CO-NH-Glu binding motif (Chen et al., 2008; Hillier et al., 2009) as their basic structure. The linker moiety was based on the linker used in PSMA-617 (Zhang et al., 2010; Benesova et al., 2016). This linker and the DOTA moiety were fine-tuned to improve the internalization efficiency and the tumor to background ratio. Four representative PSMA binding molecules, CA027, CA028, CA029, and CA030, are described here. In CA027, omission of the linker consisting of 2-naphthylalanine and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid substantially decreased the affinity, internalization, and consecutive tumor uptake. CA029 was found to strongly accumulate in the tumor; however, due to a high kidney accumulation, it was considered inferior to PSMA-617. CA028 and\nFIGURE 5 | Organ distribution of 68Ga-CA028 (0.05 nmol, 20 MBq) expressed as % ID/g of tissue \u00b1SD (n = 3) at 20 min and 1, 2, and 4 h post injection.\nFIGURE 6 | Blockade experiment with 68Ga-CA028 (0.05 nmol, 20 MBq) 1 h post injection. 2 mg of PSMA-617 per kilogram of body weight was injected at the same time as 68Ga-CA028. Data are mean expressed (n = 4).\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org August 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 8986928\nCA030 showed high tumor uptake and lower kidney retention and were consequently studied in greater detail.\nAs 68Ga-CA028 showed a rapid clearance from the kidneys, this compound reached a high tumor to kidney ratio and its characteristics might be ideally for diagnostic application (Figure 7). However, after recent introduction of 18F-labeled diagnostic compounds such as 18F-PSMA-1007, the clinical demand for improved 68Ga-labeled diagnostics is shrinking (Giesel et al., 2017; Kesch et al., 2017). Since 177LuCA028 showed signs of degradation in human serum, its stability in vivo was analyzed by radio-HPLC of tissue extracts, which showed exclusively the intact tracer. However, in contrast to DOTA conjugates, the chelator\nmoiety of CA028 lacks one amide bridge and thus slightly decreased complex stability with larger metals such as 177Lu and also 225Ac (not presented here) in comparison to 68Ga. Nevertheless, considering the rapid tumor targeting and internalization of these small molecules, the ligand might still have potential because some intra-cellular nuclide loss might be tolerated and the mean standard uptake values (mSUVs) derived from PET demonstrated a higher tumorto-kidney ratio for CA028 in comparison with the other compounds tested. However, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 4, due to its higher internalization, 68Ga-CA030 reached a more persistent tumor uptake, which might be preferable for therapeutic applications, especially when used\nFIGURE 7 | Maximum intensity projections of a PSMA-PET of a prostate cancer patient performed 1 h (A) and 3 h (B) post injection of 339 MBq/20 nmol 68GaCA028.

The linker modification with the respective benzyl moiety connected to the DOTA chelator was found to further improve the tumor targeting characteristics, and in CA027, CA029, and CA030, further fine tuning was accomplished by using DOTA variants which contained reduced numbers of polar side chains. More lipophilic chelators were found promising to improve pharmacokinetics when they were introduced to realize copper (34) or lead (35) complexed PSMA ligands (Persson et al., 2013; Hao et al., 2017; Dos Santos et al., 2019; Dos Santos et al., 2020). However, it is relevant to emphasize that the presence of the benzyl group connected directly or via a linker to the chelator can be assumed to interact with the rigid part of the PSMA binding pocket. It has been demonstrated that the active binding site of PSMA is composed of two structural motifs, one representing a lipophilic pocket and the other interacting with urea-based inhibitors (Kularatne et al., 2009; Banerjee et al., 2019). Choosing optimal chelators enables an optimal size, flexibility, and polarity of the compounds (Antunes et al., 2007; Kane, 2010; Zhang et al., 2010). In total, the affinity of 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga-CA030 to PSMA are comparable to that of 68Ga-PSMA-617 and 68Ga-PSMA11 but presents improved internalization as demonstrated in our head-to-head-comparison (Table 2) or compared to the literature (Eder et al., 2014; Benesova et al., 2015). In the first\nclinical application (Figures 7, 8), the quantitative evaluation of 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga-CA030 demonstrated a slightly prolonged circulation in the blood pool when compared to 68Ga-PSMA-617 (Table 3), similar but less pronounced to that of dedicated albumin binding PSMA tracers recently described (Benesova et al., 2018; Kuo et al., 2021). The available human data for 68Ga-labeled CA028/CA030 are limited to the initial distribution phase up to 3 h p.i. During this phase, the kidney uptake is dominated by an unspecific clearance. However, PSMA is also specifically expressed in kidneys and salivary glands (3), and it is possible that due to increased PSMAspecific internalization, the novel compounds could also be retained in the kidneys and the salivary glands at later time points (Baranski et al., 2019; Felber et al., 2021). Thus, dosimetry of 177Lu-CA028/30 up to several days p.i. would be required to draw a final decision whether the therapeutic range (ratio of absorbed dose to tumor vs. dose limiting normal organs) is really improved with the new compounds. As CA028 is hampered by its lower complex stability with larger radiometals and CA030 presents even more rapid internalization, which is considered favorable for labeling with 225Ac (currently considered one of the academically most interesting therapeutic radiometals), we propose CA030 as the most promising ligand for further clinical evaluation."

Due to more rapid tumor-cell internalization and faster non-PSMA-related kidney clearance in comparison to PSMA-617, CA030 presents a valuable novel ligand for further evaluation, for example, in combination with 225Ac. However, further clinical studies with long half-life nuclides are mandatory to investigate its pharmacokinetics beyond the 3 h interval evaluable with 68Ga-PET."
