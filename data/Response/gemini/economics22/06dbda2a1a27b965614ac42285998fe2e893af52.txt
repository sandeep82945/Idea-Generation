1. **Investigate the impact of economic policy uncertainty on carbon emissions in developing countries.** The study focused on 18 developed countries, so it would be interesting to see if the results hold true for developing countries. Developing countries often have different economic structures and environmental regulations than developed countries, so it is possible that economic policy uncertainty could have a different impact on carbon emissions in these countries.


2. **Examine the relationship between economic policy uncertainty and carbon emissions in different sectors of the economy.** The study looked at the overall impact of economic policy uncertainty on carbon emissions, but it did not examine the impact in different sectors of the economy. It is possible that economic policy uncertainty could have a different impact on carbon emissions in different sectors, such as manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture.


3. **Analyze the impact of economic policy uncertainty on carbon emissions over time.** The study used data from 2005 to 2018, so it would be interesting to see if the results hold true over a longer period of time. It is possible that the impact of economic policy uncertainty on carbon emissions could change over time, as the global economy and environmental regulations evolve.


4. **Investigate the relationship between economic policy uncertainty and other environmental indicators.** The study focused on carbon emissions, but it would be interesting to see if economic policy uncertainty also has an impact on other environmental indicators, such as air pollution, water pollution, and deforestation. This would help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental impacts of economic policy uncertainty.


5. **Examine the effectiveness of different policy interventions in mitigating the impact of economic policy uncertainty on carbon emissions.** The study did not examine the effectiveness of different policy interventions in mitigating the impact of economic policy uncertainty on carbon emissions. This would be a valuable area for future research, as it could help policymakers to develop more effective policies to reduce carbon emissions in the face of economic uncertainty.
