    "abstractText": "Cyclic N-halamines are highly antimicrobial, very stable, and not susceptible to bacterial resistance. A polysiloxane delivery vehicle was synthesized to deliver cyclic imide N-halamine onto cellulose via a benign and universal procedure that does not require a harmful solvent or chemical bonding. In brief, Knoevenagel condensation between barbituric acid and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde furnished 5-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione, whose phenolic O\u2212H was subsequently reacted with the Si\u2212H of poly(methylhydrosiloxane) (PMHS) via silane alcoholysis. The product of silane alcoholysis was interpenetrated into cellulose in supercritical CO2 (scCO2) at 50 \u25e6C, to form a continuous modification layer. The thickness of the modification layer positively correlated with interpenetration pressure in the experimental range of 10 to 28 MPa and reached a maximum value of 76.5 nm, which demonstrates the ability for tunable delivery, to control the loading of the imide N\u2212H bond originating from barbituric acid unit. The imide N\u2212H bonds on cellulose with the thickest modifier were then chlorinated into N\u2212Cl counterparts using tert-butyl hypochlorite, to exert a powerful biocidability, providing ~7 log reductions of both S. aureus and E. coli in 20 min. The stability and rechargeability of the biocidability were both very promising, suggesting that the polysiloxane modifier has a satisfactory chemical structure and interlocks firmly with cellulose via scCO2 interpenetration.",

            "text": "Antibacterial materials can prevent bacterial infection and hence are very useful in hygiene and daily life [1,2]. It is of great importance to modify materials for durable biocidability, with a powerful biocide and a facile and green procedure [3]. Compared with other commonly used polymers, such as polyolefins, cellulose is more susceptible to bacterial attachment and proliferation, due to its surface hydrophicility, which origates from the hydroxy groups [4]. It is therefore particularly significant to use cellulose as a reprensatitive to evaluate the performace of biocides and modification procedures. Many biocidal functionalities such as N-halamines (N-chloramines and N-bromamines) [5\u20137], antibiotics [8,9], quaternary ammonia salts [10\u201312], reactive oxygen species [13,14], and heavymetal ions [15\u201318] have been incorporated onto cellulose to give an antibacterial ability. Nhalamines, produced by halogenation of imide/amide/amine N\u2212H to N\u2212X (X=Cl, Br), have\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5080. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14235080 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5080 2 of 16\nmany advantages, since they are highly powerful, rechargeable, broad-spectrum, and not susceptible to bacterial resistance. The positively charged halogen atoms in N-halamines are strong oxidizers that can the destroy enzymatic and/or metabolic activities of microorganisms [19]. Among the three types of N-halamine, the imide type is the most effective, since it has the highest dissociation constant, allowing the fastest release of oxidative halogen ions [20]. In addition, a cyclic N-halamine is more stable than an acyclic one [21\u201323]. Based on these findings, a cyclic imide N-halamine is expected to be an ideal candidate for biocidal applications. Barbituric acid is a precursor of N-halamine, since it is cyclic and has two imide N\u2212H bonds for halogen binding. Small biocidal compounds including barbituric acid-based N-halamines, however, cannot tightly attach to a surface since they have limited binding sites with substrates. The leaching of small molecules causes a loss of biocidability of the substrate, pollution of the environment, and harmful interpenetration into human skin [24]. Therefore, it is preferable to use the polymeric form of N-halamine to modify a substrate. Barbituric acid needs functional groups to form polymers. For instance, a carbon\u2013 carbon double bond was introduced at C5 of barbituric acid for radical polymerization [25,26]. The functionalization at C5 using barbituric acid as a starting material is unspecific, since it can also occur at the two imide nitrogen atoms. To avoid this complication, the traditional solution was to modify the central carbon of diethyl malonate for the desired functionality by nucleophilic substitution. The resultant product was subsequently reacted with urea through condensation. However, this procedure has its own drawbacks, including a low yield, hydrolysis of malonate, decarbethoxylation, and thermal degradation of urea [27]. Knoevenagel condensation between barbituric acid and aromatic aldehydes provides a solution to the abovementioned problems, allowing a specific mono-functionalization at C5 of barbituric acid. In addition, this condensation is performed in water and does not need a catalyst, and therefore is was chosen for this study. Herein, the used aromatic aldehyde is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, to introduce a phenolic OH group at C5 of barbituric acid. Biocidal functionality has been given to cellulose using a variety of procedures. To the best of our knowledge, the only physical procedure that has been applied to cellulose for repeated usage is layer-by-layer assembly [4,28]. However, this method works better on a highly charged surface, which cellulose is not. Moreover, the anionic species in the polyelectrolyte multilayer repels negatively-charged bacteria, which lowers the contactkilling efficacy. Cellulose has hydroxy bonds that can be used to chemically connect biocidal groups. However, the areal density of the hydroxy bond is low, such that it is insufficient to generate desirable biocidability if each hydroxy bond only connects with one biocidal group. There are two common methods to form biocidal polymers, each of whose segment has one or more biocidal groups on cellulose, to compensate for the low hydroxy density. One is the formation of radicals on the surface for \u201cgrafting from\u201d polymerization of biocidal monomers [29\u201332]. The other is the use of silanes as biocidal carriers. Silanes are hydrolyzed to convert alkoxysilyl groups to silanol ones. The silanol groups of different hydrolyzates condense, not only with one another, but also with hydroxy groups of cellulose, furnishing a polysiloxane layer [33\u201335]. Herein, a physical and chemical combined procedure named scCO2 interpenetration is used to modify cellulose. This procedure does not require reactivity or a polluting solvent and, hence, is universal and benign. The principle of this procedure is that a soluble modifier penetrates into a swollen substrate in the working solvent of scCO2, to obtain a new interfacial property. Besides low-molecular-weight compounds, only a very few polymers, including polysiloxanes, fluorinated macromolecules, and poly(ethercarbonate) copolymers are soluble, since scCO2 has a very poor solvent strength [36,37]. However, almost any polymeric substrate will swell greatly in scCO2, due to its a superior interpenetration ability. Therefore, a modifier can be a small monomer that polymerizes to long chains after interpenetration, to entangle with those of the substrate or a CO2soluble polymer that does not require post-polymerization. In both cases, a polymeric modifier interlocks firmly with the substrate to provide a new interfacial property. ScCO2\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5080 3 of 16\ninterpenetration is especially useful for modification of substrates such as polyolefins and cellulose that do not swell in common liquid solvents and do not have the required reactivity. Among the few CO2-soluble polymers, polysiloxanes are usually chosen as a delivery vehicle to convey the desired functionalities such as biocidability onto substrates, since they are industrially available, nonhazardous, chemically stable, and resistant to a wide range of temperatures. The synthesis of such a delivery vehicle involves the incorporation of a functional group to a backbone composed of a \u2013Si\u2013O\u2013 repeat unit. Based on the above discussion, using scCO2 interpenetration to insert a polysiloxane delivery vehicle of cyclic imide N-halamine groups is hypothesized to be a versatile and friendly solution to forming a powerful and durable biocidability on cellulose. To verify this assumption, a polysiloxane with barbituric acid pendants was synthesized and interpenetrated into cellulose in scCO2, to form a stable interlocking layer. Subsequent chlorination of N\u2212H bonds of barbituric acid furnished a polysiloxane modifier with cyclic imide N-halamine sites. Briefly, Knoevenagel condensation between barbituric acid and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde furnished 5-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione. The phenolic hydroxy group of 5-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione was reacted with of Si\u2212H of PMHS via silane alcoholysis, to produce a biocidal polysiloxane precursor (referred to as barbituric acid-based polysiloxane). The barbituric acid-based polysiloxane was interpenetrated into cellulose in scCO2 at 50 \u25e6C, the temperature at which polysiloxanes are most soluble [36], to furnish a sample named barbituric acid-based polysiloxane@cellulose. Since the pressure of scCO2 is a crucial parameter affecting the solubility and hence the thickness of barbituric acid-based polysiloxane, the relationship between interpenetration pressure and thickness of barbituric acid-based polysiloxane was studied. The results showed that the thickness of the barbituric acid-based polysiloxane was able to be conveniently adjusted by variation of the interpenetration pressure, to deliver different amounts of the N-halamine precursor, imide N\u2212H from barbituric acid. Cellulose with the maximum loading of barbituric acid-based polysiloxane was chlorinated to convert N\u2212H bonds using tert-butyl hypochlorite, to create a sample with cyclic imide N-halamine sites on the surface, which is hereafter called cyclic imide N-halamine polysiloxane@cellulose.

The cell was then purged with CO2, heated to 50 \u25e6C and charged with CO2 to a desired pressure with a syringe pump. The cell was maintained under these conditions overnight, to complete one interpenetration process. The pressurization and depressurization periods were about 3 and 5 min, respectively. An average of three measurements was reported for each interpenetration condition. A temperature of 50 \u25e6C was selected as polysiloxanes have maximum solubility at this temperature [36]. An overnight interpenetration period was chosen since a longer time did not cause a measurable change of the loading of barbituric acid-based polysiloxane on cellulose. It is known that the solubility of polysiloxanes increases with the increase of pressure [38], indicating a facile way to form an interpenetration layer with adjustable thickness, to achieve an improved delivery ability. Herein, the thickness of barbituric acid-based polysiloxane was controlled by varying the interpenetration pressure between 8 and 28 MPa, which in turn decided the amount of cyclic imide N-halamine that was delivered to the final cellulose surface. The thickness of the barbituric acid-based polysiloxane modifier at a certain pressure can be estimated based on the weight change before and after the interpenetration process using the following Equation (1) [33]:\nh = d(W1 \u2212W0)\u03c1cellulose\n4W0\u03c1polysiloxane (1)\nwhere h is the layer thickness of barbituric acid-based polysiloxane, d is the average diameter of the original cellulose fiber (11.8 \u00b5m), W0 is the weight of the original fibers used for interpenetration, W1 is the weight of fibers after interpenetrated with barbituric acid-based polysiloxane, \u03c1cellulose is the density of cellulose (1.54 g/cm3), and \u03c1polysiloxane is the density of barbituric acid-based polysiloxane (0.99 g/cm3).

Antibacterial Testing The antibacterial function of cyclic imide N-halamine polysiloxane@cellulose was measured against the two model strains Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus, using pristine cellulose as a negative control. The log reductions of the two bacteria at different contact durations with biocidal swatches and controls are summarized in Table 1. The controls did not afford any perceptible reduction of both E. coli and S. aureus, even at 20 min of contact, since the slight decreases of E. coli (0.37 log) and S. aureus (0.36 log) were caused by natural mortality and adsorption of microbes onto the cellulose fibers. In contrast, cyclic imide N-halamine polysiloxane@cellulose swatches exerted a powerful biocidability, achieving 3.96, 5.22, 6.78, and 7.11 log reductions of E. coli and 3.42, 4.76, 6.12, and 7.08 log reductions of S. aureus at contact time of 5, 10, 15, and 20 min, respectively. The slightly lower efficacy against S. aureus could be attributed to its thicker membrane, which is more resistant to the penetration of biocidal chlorines. The efficacy herein was higher than that of amide and amine N-halamines at a similar chlorine loading, which needed a longer contact time (20\u201330 min) to kill nearly the same number of bacteria [44,45], which proved the advantage of imide N-halamine, which has the highest dissociation constant and the fastest release of chlorine ions, to provide the most efficient killing. In addition, each barbituric acid unit has two N-halamine sites and hence a higher ratio of biocidal functionality, which benefits the antibacterial performance."

            "text": "The biocidal stability and rechargeability of cyclic imide N-halamine polysiloxane@cell ulose are important parameters for the evaluation of the antibacterial group, polysiloxane modifier, and modification procedure. These two properties were therefore studied against repeated washings, UV irradiation, and storage. Polysiloxanes are ideal biocidal carriers, since they are sturdy, hydrophobic, and photodegradation resistant. As shown in Table 2, the loading of biocidal chlorine decreased with the increase of washing cycles, since the polysiloxane modifier was gradually washed away and the N-halamine sites progressively hydrolyzed, from an initial value of 0.31 wt% to 0.10 wt% and to 0.06 wt% after 5 and 10 AATCC washing cycles, respectively. The washing stability of the biocidability was very good, since even after 10 AATCC washing cycles, the chlorine loading was still higher than 0.05 wt%, the threshold value for a total kill of ~107 CFU bacteria [46]. Although the lost part of the biocidability caused by leaching of the modifier cannot be regained, the rechargeability that was contributed by rechlorination of the hydrolyzed N-halamine sites was still very satisfactory, since the samples after 10 AATCC washing cycles could be recharged to a chlorine loading of 0.10 wt% with tert-butyl hypochlorite. The good washing stability and rechargeability are attributed to several factors. The first is that the polysiloxane backbone is hydrophobic and has high bond energy, so that the modifier is resistant to washing cycles. The second is that a cyclic N-halamine is more stable than its acyclic counterpart. In addition, this also indicates that the biocidal polysiloxane was interpenetrated to a sufficient depth into the cellulose in scCO2, forming a strong interlocking structure. The method of scCO2 interpenetration does not rely on chemistry and hence is transferable to other substrates, including PET and polyolefins.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5080 13 of 16\nThe data of degradation and rechlorination of biocidal chlorines of cyclic imide Nhalamine polysiloxane@cellulose under UV irritation are summarized in Table 3. The chlorine loading declined rapidly within the first two hours, losing 55% of the initial amount. Then, the decrease became slower, reaching chlorine loadings of 0.02 wt% and 0 wt% at 24 h and 7 d, respectively. This observation of a negative acceleration is believed to be due to the polysiloxane backbone on top surface that is photodegraded to inorganic SiOx, which protected the components beneath from rapid decomposition [47]. The partial photodegradation of the polysiloxane modifier is the reason why the biocidability of the irradiated samples cannot be fully regained. The rechargeability of lost chlorines due to UV exposure was promising, since chlorine loadings of 0.19 wt% and 0.17 wt% for the samples irradiated for 24 h and 7 d were obtained, respectively.\nThe imide N-halamine sites underwent hydrolysis to furnish N\u2212H bonds during storage, due to the adsorption of moisture from air. The formed N\u2212H bonds can be rechlorinated to recover the biocidability. However, the hydrolysis of an N-halamine produces an HOCl molecule that can trigger acid-catalyzed decomposition or oxidation of components of the biocidal layer, leading to a permanent loss of chlorine. Since both washing and storage involve hydrolysis of N-halamine sites, it is naturally expected that the washing-resistant biocidability described above can be also maintained during longterm storage. The test results proved this expectation: the loading of chlorine on cyclic imide N-halamine polysiloxane@cellulose was merely reduced by 9.0%, from 0.31 wt% for fresh samples to 0.28 wt% for the samples stored at 25 \u25e6C and 65% RH in an airconditioned chamber for 3 months. Almost all of the lost chlorines in this study could be recharged, which indicates that the loss of chlorines was due to the hydrolysis of N\u2212Cl to N\u2212H instead of irreversible chemical changes. This good storage stability and rechargeability are attributed to the hydrophobic delivery vehicle of polysiloxane, which does not adsorb moisture rapidly, and the cyclic N-halamine structure, which is more stable than an acyclic one. However, more than 85% of acyclic N-halamine sites were lost in only 1 month at the same temperature and RH, when using hydrophilic chitosan as a carrier that quickly adsorbs a large quantity of moisture, to facilitate the hydrolysis of less stable, open-chain N\u2212Cl bonds [19]. Therefore, the biocidal chlorines of cyclic imide N-halamine polysiloxane@cellulose can be preserved for a long period, to offer sufficient antibacterial ability. The biocidal modifier was relatively thin in this study, due to the low solubility of barbituric acid-based polysiloxane in scCO2, which only has a poor solvent strength. A thicker modifier is desirable, since it is more damage-resistant and ensures a more durable biocidability. An increase of the interpenetration pressure can partially resolve this problem.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5080 14 of 16"

            "text": "A polysiloxane delivery vehicle was designed to carry cyclic imide N-halamine sites onto cellulose using scCO2 interpenetration, to offer a powerful, durable, and rechargeable biocidability. For this purpose, a barbituric acid-based polysiloxane was first synthesized using a two-step reaction between barbituric acid and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, followed by silane alcoholysis of the resultant sample with of PMHS. The barbituric acid-based polysiloxane was interpenetrated into cellulose in scCO2 at 50 \u25e6C and formed a layer whose thickness increased with the increase of pressure, with a maximum value of 76.5 nm at 28 MPa, showing the ability for adjustable delivery of the control of the loadings of imide N\u2212H and therefore N\u2212Cl. After chlorination of cyclic imide N\u2212H bonds of barbituric acid pendants to N-halamine formats, the final cyclic imide N-halamine polysiloxane@cellulose provided powerful biocidability, killing S. aureus and E. coli with populations of ~107 CFU in 20 min. The biocidal stability and rechargeability towards washing, UV irradiation, and storage were also promising compared with previously reported cases. These features of biocidability are attributed to the sturdy, photo-resistant, and hydrophobic polysiloxane backbone and to the stable and efficient cyclic imide N-halamine. This study also showed that scCO2 interpenetration is a benign and general surface modification method, since it does not use a polluting solvent or rely on the chemistry of the substrate. The produced antibacterial cellulose has broad applications in both daily life and the healthcare field, due to its ability to prevent bacterial infection.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.C.; methodology, Y.C. and Q.H.; software, Q.H.; validation, W.S.; formal analysis, Q.Z.; investigation, L.L., Y.X., F.W., X.L., Q.Y. and X.Y.; resources, Q.H.; data curation, L.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, Q.H.; visualization, Y.C.; supervision, Y.C.; project administration, Y.C.; funding acquisition, Y.C.
