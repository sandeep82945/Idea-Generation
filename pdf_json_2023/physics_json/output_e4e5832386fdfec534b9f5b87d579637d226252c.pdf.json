The FeOOH CDT subunit is half covered by mSiO2 nanorod along its long axis, forming sushi-like structure. The FeOOH nanospindle is about 400 nm in length and 50 nm in diameter, and the mSiO2 nanorod is about 550 nm in length and 100 nm in diameter. The length and diameter of mSiO2 subunit can be tuned in a wide range while maintaining the sushi-like Janus structure, which is attributed to a Gibbs-free-energy-dominating surface curvature-induced oriented assembly process. In this Janus therapeutic nanoplatform, Fe3+ of FeOOH is firstly reduced to Fe2+ by endogenous GSH, the as-generated Fe2+ then effectively catalyzes overexpressed H2O2 in TME into highly lethal \u00b7OH to achieve efficient CDT. The doxorubicin (DOX) loaded in the mSiO2 subunit can be released to achieve combined chemotherapy. Taking advantage of Fe\n3+-related GSH depletion, Fe2+-related enhanced \u00b7OH generation, and DOX-induced chemotherapy, the as-synthesized nanoplatform possesses excellent therapeutic efficiency, in vitro eliminating efficiency of tumor cells is as high as ~ 87%. In vivo experiments also show the efficient inhibition of tumor, verifying the synthesized sushi-like Janus nanoparticles as a promising therapeutic nanoplatform.\nConclusions In general, our work provides a successful paradigm of constructing novel therapeutic nanoplatform to achieve efficient tumor inhibition."

            "text": "Tumor has always been a vital threat to human health [1, 2] and various methods have been developed for oncological treatment. Among them, methods utilizing nanomaterials to treat tumor have been receiving much research interests for their desirable therapeutic efficiency and minimized side effects [3\u20137]. Recently, treatments based on nanotechnology, including photodynamic therapy, chemodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy have attracted much attention [3, 8, 9]. Thereby, researchers have proposed myriads of novel nanoplatforms with multitudinous compositions and structures to continuously provide new modalities for cancer treatment [10\u201313]. Among multiple nanotherapeutic approaches, chemodynamic therapy (CDT) which can in-situ transform endogenous reactive substrate (H2O2) into toxic tumor-killing matters (\u00b7OH), has attracted extensive research interest for its minimized toxicity to non-lesion sites, reduced drug resistance and robust lethality [6, 7, 14\u201324]. However, tumor microenvironment (TME) in which tumor cells exist features not only acidity [25, 26] and overexpression of H2O2 [27], but also overexpression of GSH (up to 10 \u00d7 10\u2212 3\u00a0M) [28] for regulating redox equilibrium in the TME. The robust anti-oxidation property endowed by high concentration of GSH severely impedes the effectiveness of CDT. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a novel therapeutic platform combined with GSH depletion to achieve desirable CDT efficiency.\nMesoporous silica (mSiO2)-based CDT nanoplatforms have attracted a great deal of interests for their potential in combining the high drug loading capacity endowed by mSiO2 and efficient CDT of functional nanomaterials with enzyme-like activity to achieve combined CDT [14, 23, 29\u201332]. Most of these composite nanoplatforms adopted core@shell structure, co-assembly or post-loading/grafting strategies. However, the aforementioned structures possess inherent shortage that different functional units in a nanoplatform cannot exert their functionalities to the maximum extent due to interference between them, thus severely retarding the effectiveness of combined therapy [33\u201337]. Consequently, it is necessary to construct a novel structure to achieve the combination of the advantage of mSiO2 and functional nanomaterials and isolation of their functions.\nHerein, inspired by the unique combination of rice and diverse ingredients in sushi, we developed a surface curvature-induced oriented assembly strategy to synthesize sushi-like mesoporous Janus composite nanomaterials. The nanoplatform was constructed by oriented assembly of mSiO2 nanorods on FeOOH nanospindles, followed\nby the loading of anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), forming pristine and DOX-loaded FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus composite nanoparticles (abbreviated as FMS and FMSDOX, respectively). The synthesized FMS is structurally composed of two functional units, a spindle-shaped FeOOH CDT subunit with a length of about 400\u00a0 nm and a diameter of about 50\u00a0 nm and a rod-like mSiO2 drug-loading subunit with about 550\u00a0 nm in length and 100\u00a0 nm in diameter. The FeOOH CDT subunit is half covered by mSiO2 nanorod along its long axis, forming sushi-like nanostructure. The length and width of the mSiO2 nanorod can be tuned in a wide range to achieve a series of sushi-like structures. Such kind of intelligent therapeutic nanoplatform possesses enhanced CDT and drug delivery for efficient tumor inhibition by TMEactivable sequential catalytic reactions (Fig.\u00a0 1). Once FMS nanoparticles were endocytosed into cancer cells, the reductive GSH in TME can trigger the reduction of FeOOH, enabling the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ which further catalyze overexpressed H2O2 in TME into highly lethal \u00b7OH for efficient CDT. Meanwhile, GSH is depleted and combined with DOX release in acidic environment, which further exemplifies oxidative stress to tumor cells, thus achieving efficient tumor inhibition by combined therapy. Based on such a novel therapeutic nanoplatform, in vitro eliminating efficiency of tumor cells is as high as ~ 87%, in vivo experiments further show the efficient inhibition of tumor, verifying the synthesized FMS as a promising therapeutic nanoplatform."

Then, mesoporous silica nanorods (mSiO2) are oriented grown along the longaxial curvature of the FeOOH nanospindles, forming sushi-like nanostructure. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images depict that mSiO2 nanorod with a diameter of ~ 100\u00a0 nm winds along the axial curvature of FeOOH nanospindle and extends slightly at the ends of the long axis of the nanospindle, covering half of it (Fig.\u00a0 2B and E). The length of the mSiO2 nanorods is about 550\u00a0nm, large-area SEM image shows that the asymmetric structure was synthesized with good morphological purity and dispersity (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Such a winding-made sushi-like structure confers a strong binding force to the two functional units, thus ensuring superior structural\nKeywords Mesoporous, Nanocatalytic medicine, Chemodynamic therapy, Janus nanoparticles, Asymmetric nanostructure\nstability (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 3). Elemental mapping results clearly show the uneven distribution of Fe and Si in the nanoparticle, verifying the sushi-like Janus structure (Fig.\u00a0 2H, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 4). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) result indicate that the Si/Fe atomic ratio of FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticle is about 5:1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 5). The nitrogen sorption isotherm of the obtained FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticles features a type-IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop at a relative pressure of 0.4\u20130.7, which is contributed by the ordered mesopores in the mSiO2 nanorod subunits (Fig.\u00a0 2F). The Brunauer \u2212 Emmett \u2212 Teller (BET) surface area and Barrett \u2212 Joyner \u2212 Halenda (BJH) pore size of FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticles are calculated to be 319.55 m2/g and \u223c4.6\u00a0nm, respectively. High magnification TEM image shows that the mesoporous channels parallel to the long-axial direction of FeOOH (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns show no difference between the peaks of pristine FeOOH and FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticles (Fig.\u00a0 2G), both of them are consistent with tetragonal \u03b2-FeOOH phase (JCPDS 34-1266).\nThe synthetic method exhibits excellent tunability. A series of FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticles with controllable morphologies can be synthesized by simply adjusting the additive amount of CTAB and NH3\u00b7H2O. As shown in Fig.\u00a03A F, a series of FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticles winded with different length of mSiO2 nanorods were synthesized by manipulating the concentration of CTAB in the reaction solution. The length of mSiO2 increased accordingly when the amount of CTAB is upregulated. The island-like mSiO2 subunit can be clearly observed when the concentration of CTAB is controlled at a relatively low level (1.4 mM \u2212 2.7 mM), forming axe-like Janus nanocomposite with FeOOH\n(Fig.\u00a0 3A, Supplementary Figs.\u00a0 7\u20138). Sushi-like structure can be obtained when the concentration of CTAB is controlled at an appropriate level of 6.9\u20139.6 mM (Fig.\u00a03B C, Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). In contrast, when the concentration of CTAB is further increased to 10.8 mM or even higher (20.6 mM \u2212 27.4 mM), mSiO2 nanorods covering on the FeOOH nanospindles grows thinner and longer. Long tails can be formed and disengage from the curvature of FeOOH nanospindles (Fig.\u00a0 3D F, Supplementary Figs.\u00a0 10\u201312). The diameter of the mSiO2 nanorods can also be finetuned by adjusting the concentration of NH3\u00b7H2O. Mesoporous silica nanorods cannot be formed when the amount of NH3\u00b7H2O is lower than 2% (Supplementary Figs.\u00a013\u201314), only resulting in the uniform coating layers on the FeOOH nanospindles to form core@ shell structure. The diameter of mSiO2 nanorods is about 200\u00a0 nm when the amount of NH3\u00b7H2O is increased to 3%. When the amount of NH3\u00b7H2O is further increased to 4% or 8%, the diameter of mSiO2 nanorods was further increased to ~ 300 or 400\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a03G H, Supplementary Figs.\u00a015\u201317). An excessive amount of NH3\u00b7H2O (10-20%, Supplementary Figs.\u00a018\u201319) leads to phase separation. Synthetic temperature and the amount of TEOS also have a significant influence on the morphology of synthesized nanocomposite (Supplementary Figs.\u00a0 20\u201326). Such a self-assembly strategy can also be applied to other nanoparticles with rod-like structure, such as Bi2S3, Au nanorod and so on, sushi-like structure can be obtained in similar reaction conditions, demonstrating the good versatility of this strategy (Supplementary Figs.\u00a027\u201328).\nAll the data reveals that mSiO2 nanorod can \u201crecognize\u201d the long axis of the FeOOH nanospindle and always grows axially into sushi-like structure. In contrast to conventional mesoporous Janus nanoparticles, such kind of\nanisotropic growth is site-selective. As shown in Fig.\u00a04A, at the initial stage of the reaction, mSiO2 first nucleates near the center of the long axis of the nanospindle, forming a \u201cT\u201d-shaped structure, and the directionality of the mesoporous silicon growth is not visible at this point. The mSiO2 nanorods then grow along the long axis of the FeOOH nanospindle, although most of the rods grow toward one end first, forming a deviated structure (Fig.\u00a0 4E). Eventually, the silica nanorods cover the long axis of the FeOOH nanospindle completely, forming a sushi-like structure. It can be seen that mSiO2 nanorods spontaneously undergo a direction-selective growth, rather than being concentrated on the long axis by rearrangement. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the growth of other forms of silica with disordered mesotructure (nonporous, radial porous) exhibit no similar oriented-growth selectivity (Supplementary Figs.\u00a0 29\u201330). On the contrary, the growth of periodic mesoporous\norganosilicon (PMO) with cubic mesostructure exhibits similar long-axis selectivity as mSiO2 nanorod (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 31), thus we speculate that the ordered mesostructure of the mSiO2 nanorod plays a key role in oriented-growth selectivity.\nBased on the above experimental results, we propose the surface curvature-induced oriented assembly mechanism from the perspective of reaction thermodynamics, so as to explain the long-axis selective growth phenomenon in the sushi-like structure. The free energy change (\u0394G) during the whole mesoporous silica nanorod growth process can be divided into three parts: (1) \u0394G1 for the energy change during silane\u2019s nucleation to form mesoporous silica. (2) The formation of a new interface between silica and FeOOH, there is an interfacial energy change \u0394G2. (3) The energy required for the ordered mesostructure to curve along the interface, \u0394G3.\nFormulated as: \u0394G = \u0394G1 + \u0394G2 + \u0394G3. The system tends to evolve in a \u0394G-minimal way.\nAmong the three energy changes, \u0394G1 depends mainly on synthetic conditions but not FeOOH nanospindle, so G1 is the same between long and short axis directions. While \u0394G2 and \u0394G3 are both related to the interface and influenced by the surface curvature of precursor. However, \u0394G2 interfacial energy is an atomic-level interaction and is less affected by nanoscale interfaces, thus G2 does not change much with growing direction. The main factor affecting \u0394G3 is the assembly of CTAB micelles on the solid surface. The CTAB micelles can be regarded as nanorods with a diameter of about 3\u00a0nm, and the surface\ncurvature of the FeOOH nanospindle is of the same order of magnitude, so \u0394G3 is significantly influenced by the curvature. As can be seen in Fig.\u00a04G H, the surface curvature along the long axis direction (side view) is small and can be nearly regarded as flat, while the curvature in the short axis (front view) direction is way larger, so \u0394G3short > \u0394G3long. The total \u0394Glong in the long axis direction is smaller than \u0394G3short in the short axis direction, so the mesoporous silica nanorods are assembled and grown along the long axis and stop at both ends to obtain a sushi-like structure, from which we can reasonably explain afore-mentioned experimental results.\nThis mechanism explains the previously observed experimental phenomenon that the oriented growth of mSiO2 is always present simultaneously with ordered mesostructure. The \u0394G required for bending the ordered mesostructure on the surface of FeOOH nanospindles is the main cause of directional selectivity. Therefore, regardless of changes in length or diameter of the mSiO2 nanorods or even cubic mesostructure, the mSiO2 always undergo oriented growth along the long axis direction of the FeOOH nanospindles (i.e. the surface with minimal curvature). Once the silica no longer grows with ordered mesostructure (such as the radially orientated porous or nonporous structure), the \u0394G does not involve the variable related to the curvature of the mesostructure (\u0394G3). Thus, the \u0394G of the mesoporous silica growing at different positions on the FeOOH nanospindle is nearly the same, the oriented growth characteristic disappears."

            "heading": "Catalytic and drug-loading properties of FMS",
            "text": "To further investigate the catalytic properties of FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticles, methylene blue (MB) was used as a probe to assess the generation of hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) under the catalysis of FMS. In a weak acidic environment (pH 5.4), the FeOOH subunits in FMS can catalyze H2O2 to generate \u00b7OH, which is demonstrated by the degradation of MB, symbolled by the visibly diminished blue color of the reaction solution and significantly weakened absorption peak at 665\u00a0 nm from UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig.\u00a0 5A and B). MB was not degraded by FMS or H2O2 alone, and was partially degraded with the presence of both FMS and H2O2. MB degradation reaches the maximum extent under the catalysis of FMS in the presence of both H2O2 and GSH. It can be seen in the inset optical photograph in Fig.\u00a05A that the blue color of MB solutions varied significantly under different catalytic condition. Under the catalysis of FMS, MB is completely degraded in 6\u00a0h, and the degradation of MB gradually expedites with time (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 32A). The catalytic performance of FMS exhibits a positive correlation to the concentration of H2O2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 32B). As shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 32C, the velocity of MB degradation is also related to the concentration of GSH, which gradually increases accordingly when the concentration of GSH is upregulated. Thus, we can conclude that GSH can enhance the catalytic properties of Janus nanocomposites. We then further investigated the role of GSH in the enhanced catalytic performance. The depletion of GSH\nwas investigated by utilizing 5,5\u2032-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) as a molecular indicator which could be reduced by GSH to generate yellow 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (TNB) with a characteristic absorbance at 412 nm [39] (Fig.\u00a05C). In the presence of FMS nanoparticles, the GSH content gradually decreased with the extension of incubation time, and about ~ 45% of the GSH in the solution was consumed in 8\u00a0h. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis also shows that Fe3+ of FMS is almost completely conversed to Fe2+ after co-incubating\nwith GSH for 6\u00a0h, which further proved the GSH depletion effect of FeOOH functional units in FMS (Fig.\u00a05D). It has been demonstrated that Fe2+ ion has a higher Fenton activity than Fe3+ ion [40\u201345]. So we can conclude that Fe3+ consumes GSH while being converted to more active Fe2+, and the as-generated Fe2+ is further oxidized to Fe3+ when catalyzing the generation of \u00b7OH, and this cycle goes on to facilitate a GSH depletion & CDT combined therapy (Fig.\u00a05E).\nWith abundant mesopores, mSiO2-based FMS can be utilized to load therapeutic agents to achieve combined chemotherapy. As one of the most prevailing chemotherapy drugs, Doxorubicin (DOX) is loaded into FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticles (FMS-DOX). The success loading of DOX can be proved by fluorescence spectra of FMS, DOX and FMS-DOX (Supplementary Fig.\u00a033A). The loading capacity of DOX were measured by UV/vis spectrum and calculated to be ~ 40 wt% (at DOX/ FMS ratio of 2:1), and it drastically decreases from ~ 80 wt% to ~ 40 wt% according to the adjustment of feeding ratio of DOX/FMS (w/w) in an ascending order (Supplementary Fig.\u00a033B). Besides, the DOX release is measured by UV/vis spectra. It can be seen that the DOX release is intensely dependent on the pH of the medium. At a pH of 5.4, DOX release is very fast in the first 2\u00a0h, reaching 60%. Then, the release slows down and gradually reaches above 80% in 24\u00a0h. In contrast, DOX only release ~ 30% in 24\u00a0h at pH of 7.2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a033C). In this way, the release of DOX can be synergized with the acid-catalyzed Fenton reaction to achieve combined chemotherapy-CDT treatment."

            "text": "We then investigated the therapeutic effect of Janus nanoparticles on tumor cells. The in vitro cytotoxicity of FMS and FMS-DOX was performed on 4T1 cells by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Pristine FMS Janus nanoparticles have excellent biocompatibility and are not toxic to cells even at a high concentration of 200 \u00b5g/mL (Supplementary Fig.\u00a034A). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A and Supplementary Fig.\u00a034B, the introduction of H2O2 and GSH to FMS can significantly decrease the cell viability, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of GSH depletion and CDT. On the contrary, the co-incubation of 4T1 cells with pristine H2O2 or GSH didn\u2019t result in significant cell apoptosis, proving the addition of exogenous H2O2 or GSH has minor effect on cells\u2019 living (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 34C). The ability of eliminating tumor cells of FMS can be further enhanced by loading anti-cancer model drug doxorubicin (DOX), achieving ~ 91% eliminating efficiency of tumor cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a034D). Same tendency can also be observed on core@shell structured FeOOH@mSiO2 nanoparticles (C-FMS) which has weaker tumor cell elimination capability compared\nto sushi-like Janus FeOOH&mSiO2. The differences in tumor cell elimination efficiency can be attributed to the less-exposed active sites of FeOOH functional units and poorer mass transfer in the core@shell structure [14, 46] (Supplementary Fig.\u00a035). The in vitro CDT effect of FMS was further demonstrated by a ROS probe of 2\u2019,7\u2019-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), which can be deacetylated by intracellular esterase to nonfluorescent one, and then oxidized by ROS into green fluorescent 2\u2019,7\u2019-dichlorofuorescin (DCF) [23]. As can be seen in Fig.\u00a06B, no obvious fluorescence was observed in the cells of control group, while the cells treated with FMS show faintish green fluorescence, the cells treated with FMS, H2O2 and GSH display bright and strong green fluorescence, demonstrating a robust intracellular \u00b7OH production.\nThe in vitro combined therapeutic efficiency of FMS and FMS-DOX was also evaluated by incubating 4T1 cells with different samples for 12\u00a0h and then co-stained with Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (Calcein-AM) and propidium iodide (PI), which show green fluorescence for live cells and red fluorescence for dead cells respectively. As shown in Fig.\u00a06C, the cells without any treatment (control group) grow very well, while a small portion of dead cells is observed from the cells incubated with FMS with or without H2O2, indicating the oxidative stress produced by the Fe3+-mediated Fenton reaction. More importantly, a large number of dead cells are observed from the group incubated with FMS, H2O2 and GSH, indicating the exemplified oxidative stress produced by Fe2+-mediated Fenton reaction, which can be attributed to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ accompanied by GSH depletion. Only red fluorescence (signals of dead cells) can be observed from the group incubated with FMS-DOX, H2O2 and GSH, indicating the superior therapeutic efficiency of the nanoplatform. The confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) images show that the nanoparticles can carry and release DOX into the cell (Fig.\u00a06D). After 4\u00a0h of co-incubation, the red fluorescence of DOX can be clearly observed around the nucleus (labeled with blue fluorescence), implying that DOX was carried by FMS and taken up by the cells together. At 12\u00a0h, the red and blue fluorescence almost overlapped, implying that DOX was released from FMS and entered into the nucleus. The annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit was introduced to quantitatively analyze the cell apoptosis assay after different treatments. Obviously, the apoptosis rate of tumor cells in the FMS-DOX group with H2O2 and GSH could reach as high as ~ 99% after 12\u00a0h of incubation, which is much higher than that of the other groups (Fig.\u00a0 6E), further demonstrating the excellent therapeutic efficacy of the nanoplatform. Same tendency can also be seen when the incubation time was further adjusted to 6\u00a0 h (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 36). In comparison, core@\nshell structured FeOOH@mSiO2 (C-FMS) has lower therapeutic efficiency than asymmetric FMS, which can be observed on the flow cytometric quantitative analysis results of 4T1 cells co-incubated with C-FMS in similar chemical conditions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 37). In addition, the intracellular GSH consumption has also been monitored quantitively with 5,5\u2032-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The results showed that intracellular GSH was consumed ~ 60% after 8\u00a0h of co-incubation with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of FMS, proving the excellent GSH depletion efficiency of FMS nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig.\u00a038).\nIn vivo therapeutic effect of FMS and FMS-DOX. Encouraged by the excellence of FMS-DOX in vitro therapeutic results, we then evaluated the cooperative therapeutic effect of FMS-DOX on 4T1-tumor-bearing mice. Hemolysis analysis was firstly conducted to evaluate the hemo-compatibility of FMS, it can be seen that all samples show negligible hemolytic effect even exposed to a high concentration of FMS (400\u00a0 \u00b5g/mL), indicating the superior hemo-compatibility of prepared nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 39). As shown in Fig.\u00a07A, the tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into four groups for different treatments: saline (control group), DOX, FMS and FMS-DOX. Compared with the control group, the tumor growth is inhibited effectively after treating with FMS or FMS-DOX nanocomposite (Fig.\u00a0 7B C). The group treated with FMS-DOX exhibits the most robust inhibition to tumor growth (~ 50%) due to combined CDT and chemotherapy compared with other groups (FMS: ~25%, DOX: ~30%), which can also be confirmed by the H&E staining assay and optical photographs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0 40). The body weight\nof treated mice exhibits no abnormal fluctuations, and no remarkable tissue damage or any other side effect is observed on heart, liver and kidney (Fig.\u00a07E and Supplementary Fig.\u00a041), demonstrating the excellent biocompatibility of the FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticles, which is attributed to starkly different catalytic activities of the nanocomposite in normal physiological environment and tumor microenvironment."

            "text": "In summary, we have developed a surface curvatureinduced oriented assembly strategy to synthesize a sushilike mesoporous Janus composite materials composed of two subunits of a spindle-shaped FeOOH CDT subunit (~ 400\u00a0 nm in length and ~ 50\u00a0 nm in diameter) and a rod-shaped mSiO2 drug-loading subunit (~ 550\u00a0 nm in length and ~ 100\u00a0 nm in diameter) which covers half of the FeOOH nanospindle along its long axis. We elucidated how surface curvature affect the assembly of ordered mesostructure which leads to axis-selective growth of mSiO2 and synthesized a series of sushi-like Janus nanoparticles with varied morphologies. In acidic and reductive TME, Fe3+ of FMS-DOX is firstly reduced to Fe2+ by endogenous GSH, the as-generated Fe2+ then\neffectively catalyzes overexpressed H2O2 in TME into highly lethal \u00b7OH, and DOX is then released to achieve combined CDT and chemotherapy. Meanwhile, the redox reaction between Fe3+ and endogenous GSH in TME can effectively recede the antioxidant capability of the tumor, further exemplifying the oxidative stress produced by \u00b7OH to tumor cells. The combination of Fe3+-related GSH depletion, Fe2+-mediated \u00b7OH generation, and DOXinduced chemotherapy endows FMS-DOX with highly efficient tumor inhibition capabilities in both vitro and vivo, providing a promising intelligent therapeutic nanoplatform for oncology. We believe that the surface curvature-induced oriented assembly strategy proposed here can also be an intriguing and enlightening strategy for the construction of more novel nanoplatforms with unique isolated functional units."

The UV/Vis spectra were recorded on Lambda 35 Perkin-Elmer. Confocal fluorescence images were obtained by an LSM 980 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss SMT Inc., USA). Flow cytometry analysis was performed by an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA). The fluorescence spectra were measured on an Edinburgh FLS980 spectroscope, with all the nanoparticles dispersed in water to form a transparent colloidal dispersion.\nAbbreviations\nTME Tumor microenvironment NP(s) Nanoparticle(s) CDT Chemodynamic therapy DIW Deionized water DOX Doxorubicin CTAB hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium Bromide TEOS tetraethyl orthosilicate DTNB 5,5\u2032-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) MB Methylene blue GSH Glutathione mSiO2 mesoporous silica FMS(s) FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticle(s) FMS-DOX DOX-loaded FeOOH&mSiO2 Janus nanoparticle C-FMS(s) Core@shell structured FeOOH@mSiO2 nanoparticle(s) PBS Phosphate buffered saline CCK-8 Cell counting kit 8 Calcein AM/PI Calcein acetoxymethyl ester/propidium iodide DAPI 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole DCFH-DA 2,7-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate DMEM Dulbecco\u2019s modifed Eagle\u2019s medium FBS Fetal bovine serum PXRD Powder X-ray diffraction SEM Scanning electron microscopy TEM Transmission electron microscopy EDS Energy dispersive spectroscopy BET Brunauer \u2212 Emmett \u2212 Teller BJH Barrett \u2212 Joyner \u2212 Halenda XPS X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy CLSM Confocal laser scanning microscopy FLS Fluorescence spectrum H&E Hematoxylin and eosin\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s12951-023-02138-0.\nSupplementary Material 1\nAcknowledgements Not applicable.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions All authors have given approval to the final version of the manuscript.
