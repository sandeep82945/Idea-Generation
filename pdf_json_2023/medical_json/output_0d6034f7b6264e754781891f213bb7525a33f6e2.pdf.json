Laboratorial and clinical variables were collected. Mortality curves were compared in four groups: diabetic ketoacidosis as a new-onset type 1 diabetes (group A), single diabetic ketoacidosis episode after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (group B), 2\u20135 diabetic ketoacidosis events (group C), and > 5 diabetic ketoacidosis events during follow-up period (group D).\nResults During the follow-up period (approximately 1823 days), the mortality rate was 16.02% (37/231). The median age at death was 38.7 years. In the survival curve analysis, at 1926 days (5 years), the probabilities of death were indicated by ratios of 7.78%, 4.58%, 24.40%, and 26.63% in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. One diabetic ketoacidosis episode compared with \u2265 2 events had a relative risk of 4.49 (p = 0.004) of death and > 5 events had 5.81 (p = 0.04). Neuropathy (RR 10.04; p < 0.001), retinopathy (relative risk 7.94; p < 0.01), nephropathy (RR 7.10; p < 0.001), mood disorders (RR 3.57; p = 0.002), antidepressant use (RR 3.09; p = 0.004), and statin use (RR 2.81; p = 0.0024) increased the risk of death.\nConclusions Patients with type 1 diabetes with > 2 diabetic ketoacidosis episodes have four times greater risk of death in 5 years. Microangiopathies, mood disorders, and use of antidepressants and statins were important risk factors for short-term mortality.\nKeywords Diabetic ketoacidosis, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis, Mortality"

            "text": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is still the leading cause of death and morbidity and imposes major demands on the health of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). At initial diagnosis, the incidence of DKA ranges from 13 to 80% [1\u20134] and varies according socioeconomic country backgrund. In Brazil, a multicenter study demonstrated that 42.3% of T1D individuals presented DKA at diagnosis [4] noncompliance is the major precipitating factor of DKA [5, 6], which is an important cause of death [7].\nQuestionably, even with the low mortality rate (1\u20132%) in acute events [1, 8, 9], mainly justified by guidelines and institutional protocols to diagnose and treat this condition and avoid unfavorable outcomes, evidence reveals that recurrent DKA (rDKA) throughout the life of a patient with T1D can be an important predictor of mortality [10, 11]. In patients with chronic T1D, chronic hyperglycemia, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion dysfunction, smoking, alcohol consumption, and diabetic nephropathy were associated with recurrent rDKA [12]. This condition can be also a part of \u201cbrittle diabetes\u201d [10, 13\u201318]. Nevertheless, rDKA, which is not yet precisely defined, can account for up to > 50% of DKA cases in huge hospitals [19]. rDKA could be associated with substantial mortality rates during follow-up after hospital discharge [11, 16] and partially with an increased risk of suicide attempts [20, 21].\nIn patients with rDKA, death usually occurs relatively early (4th decade of life), following hospital discharge, in those with > 5 DKA admissions [11]. Recent data from a US cohort showed that 21.6% of DKA cases\nwere recurrent, and the odds of death increased with the number of hospital admissions for DKA [16]. These data are in contrast with those recorded in 1991\u20132010; with improved access to care for patients with diabetes, including the free provision of insulin [22]. Thus, to prevent future admissions and reduce the mortality rate, determining the characteristics of patients at high risk for rDKA is essential to the implementation of an adequate follow-up program.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed this issue in the Brazilian context, which is relevant because the risk factors of rDKA may have particularities in a patient population who have universal access to a public healthcare system. Our teaching hospital in Sao Paulo City (SP, Brazil) serves a diverse and underserved inner-city population with high rates of rDKA. Therefore, this study aimed to retrospectively analyze patient factors associated with rDKA admissions and assess the risk of mortality in the years following a short-time hospital discharge."

From a total of 428 patients identified during the study period, we excluded those who during follow-up were diagnosed with other types of diabetes or despite the code did not fulfill the ketoacidosis criteria (n = 165) and who could not be available for follow-up (n = 32).

Despite the total mortality of 16.02%, we found a low rate of inpatient mortality from DKA (2.16%), which is almost satisfactory according to most recent studies [19].\nWhen subcategorized by the number of hospitalizations, the highest probability of death was found in the group with 2\u20135 episodes of DKA within 5 years of followup.

A young age at T1D diagnosis and psychological changes during adolescence are high-risk factors for rDKA if patients are not well supervised during this period [6\u201326].\nIn our population, although the study was conducted in a developing country, our gross mortality data were similar to those in studies conducted in developed countries, further reinforcing the global difficulty of diabetes control in these individuals and the concept that they may represent a different T1D group with specific demands for care. That is, in our study, the mortality curve projection indicated that those who have > 2 DKA episodes during their lifetime have a greater mortality risk, specifically those with rDKA. Thus, this patient group must receive personalized follow-up and different from other patients with T1D, considering that mortality and its psychosocial aspects varied and require different monitoring [13, 27].\nIn this study, the median age of mortality was < 40 years old. If compared with the average Brazilian life expectancy, these patients lost on average three decades of life [28].\nThe main triggers of DKA noted in this study were the lack of adherence to treatment (47%). Theoretically, considering that a large proportion of the studied patients were on standard treatment with multiple doses of human insulin or analogs (approximately 60%) and just a few had a treatment considered inappropriate for T1D (15.5% were using oral medications or only basal insulin), insulin compliance is probably the main goal to prevent rDKA. More importantly, in our National Health System, patients have free access to insulin. Another factor that is related to treatment compliance is the significant difference between psychiatric disturbances and antidepressant use in nonsurvivors when compared with survivors. According to our data, antidepressant users are approximately three times more likely to die than those who do not. In UK [29] and US [17] series, higher DKA rates were found in patients who have depression, received antipsychotic medications, and had substance abuse.\nOn a pathogenetic point of view regarding T1D, nonsurvivors had lower levels of C-peptide, corroborating both a longer time of T1D diagnosis and a lower insulin reserve in this group. This finding is in line with those in another study [30], showing that worse beta cell function is associated with rDKA.\nIn our assessment of risk factors, we found that neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy increase 7\u201310 times the mortality risk of individuals with rDKA. Despite being an expected finding, the presence of chronic complications increases the risk of death [24].\nAs statin use was a risk factor for death (RR 2.8), the manifested and residual cardiovascular disease is a potential determinant of worse outcomes. Patients diagnosed\nwith T1D before the age of 10 years may have 30 times increased risk of coronary heart disease and acute myocardial infarction in the early adult years [31].\nThe strengths of the study were related to the singlecenter setting and double-checking of medical records to exclude individuals who, despite having ICD code for ketoacidosis, do not have T1D, considering our institutional clinical criteria for the classification of T1D.\nThe vast majority of studies on rDKA do not take into account that research based solely on ICD-10 may result in discrepancies and errors related to diabetes classification, biochemical criteria of DKA, coding accuracy [32], and changes in ICD classification over the years [33]. The use of entry codes alone, as a big data analysis, may result in having a larger sample of patients [25], but may not include patients with T1D alone. Thus, we try to minimize the inclusion of patients who were classified inadequately as having T1D or who did not have the biochemical criteria for DKA.\nMoreover, as this study relied on data from electronic medical records, with data sources collected primarily in hospitals, this study may have some biases regarding the validity of information despite double-checking.\nThe survival analysis was based on previous studies and a pilot analysis. Some patients were lost and were removed from the analysis (n = 32). However, these were analyzed statistically, and no variable with a statistical difference was found in the total analysis group (n = 231).\nAs the characteristics of our patients were broadly comparable with those in several other studies [34, 35], we can say that our findings have wider applicability regarding the significant associationss in the risks of both rDKA and subsequent mortality, despite the relatively small sample size."
