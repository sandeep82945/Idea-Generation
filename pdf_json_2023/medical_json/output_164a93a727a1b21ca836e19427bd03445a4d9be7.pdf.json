    "abstractText": "This paper presents an innovative research project that aims to study the emotional factors influencing decision-making elicited by infomercials, a powerful sales technique that uses emotional communication to engage viewers, capture attention, and build trust. Using cutting-edge consumer neuroscience techniques, this study focuses on the identification of the variables that most impact the Call-to-Action and Purchase Intention. Forty participants were selected and divided into two groups, with each group exposed to one of two infomercials (condition A = male seller; condition B = female seller). EEG signals were recorded as well as Eye-tracking data. After the viewing, participants completed a self-report questionnaire. Results show that seller characteristics such as Performance and Trustworthiness, as well as Neurophysiological variables such as Approach-Withdrawal Index, Willingness to Pay, Attention and Engagement, significantly impact the final Call-to-Action, Purchase Intention, and infomercial Likeability responses. Moreover, eye-tracking data revealed that the more time is spent observing crucial areas of the infomercial, the more it will increase our Willingness to Pay and our interest and willingness to approach the infomercial and product. These findings highlight the importance of considering both the Seller attributes and the consumers\u2019 Neurophysiological responses to understand and predict their behaviors in response to marketing stimuli since they all seem to play a crucial role in shaping consumers\u2019 attitudes and purchase intentions. Overall, the study is a significant pilot in the new field of neuroselling, shedding light on crucial emotional aspects of the seller/buyer relationship and providing valuable insights for researchers and marketers.",

Using cutting-edge consumer neuroscience techniques, this study focuses on the identification of the variables that most impact the Call-to-Action and Purchase Intention. Forty participants were selected and divided into two groups, with each group exposed to one of two infomercials (condition A = male seller; condition B = female seller). EEG signals were recorded as well as Eye-tracking data. After the viewing, participants completed a self-report questionnaire. Results show that seller characteristics such as Performance and Trustworthiness, as well as Neurophysiological variables such as Approach-Withdrawal Index, Willingness to Pay, Attention and Engagement, significantly impact the final Call-to-Action, Purchase Intention, and infomercial Likeability responses. Moreover, eye-tracking data revealed that the more time is spent observing crucial areas of the infomercial, the more it will increase our Willingness to Pay and our interest and willingness to approach the infomercial and product. These findings highlight the importance of considering both the Seller attributes and the consumers\u2019 Neurophysiological responses to understand and predict their behaviors in response to marketing stimuli since they all seem to play a crucial role in shaping consumers\u2019 attitudes and purchase intentions. Overall, the study is a significant pilot in the new field of neuroselling, shedding light on crucial emotional aspects of the seller/buyer relationship and providing valuable insights for researchers and marketers.\nKEYWORDS\nneuromarketing, neuroselling, infomercials, EEG, call-to-action, purchase intention\n1.

Detecting the elements occurring in the sales-buyers\u2019 relations is therefore crucial for human being understanding. Studying sales techniques and dynamics through psychology and neuroscience, indeed, allows to deepen the human brain functioning and how it can affect human behavior and decision-making process and improve sales dynamics (Ca\u00f1izares Stay and Ca\u00f1izares Stay, 2018). Despite the fact that there are few studies on this topic, the opportunity of applying knowledge of the brain and its functioning to managerial processes has enabled us to re-examine these models. The application of neuroscience to selling \u2013 neuroselling \u2013 can be\u00a0conceptualized as a way of highlighting the role of the human mind in the selling process to optimize sellers\u2019 effectiveness and increase sales (Ca\u00f1izares Stay and Ca\u00f1izares Stay, 2018). Despite the fact that neuroselling remains a relatively unexplored field of research, there are some notable works that can be\u00a0mentioned as pioneers in the field. Studies indicate that neuroselling is becoming increasingly relevant in different areas of selling that is the traditional one, tv, and radio advertising, sales by email, and also door to door selling (Ca\u00f1izares Stay and Ca\u00f1izares Stay, 2018). Among the studies which dealt with neuroselling, Sun et\u00a0al. (2019) used Electroencephalography (EEG) to simultaneously measure brain activity in pairs of subjects during an economic game, revealing that sellers mimic consumers to increase trust. Already in 2008, Tanner et\u00a0 al. (2008) introduced a similar concept, the Chameleon Effect which shows that mimicking the other person leads to better negotiation outcomes. Mu\u00f1oz et\u00a0al. (2019) implemented EEG to determine the most attention-grabbing sales techniques, yielding interesting insights for adjusting sales techniques to reach the \u201cneurocognitive pathways of attention.\u201d Neurophysiological indices have also been measured in salespeople (Randolph et\u00a0 al., 2013), revealing different neuronal activations depending on their experience: while experienced sellers record higher relaxation levels, sales managers record higher cognitive load (higher prefrontal activation). From these few but promising studies emerges the importance of further investigation on selling, to better analyze the emotional dynamics and bring insights aimed at improving salespeople\u2019s performance.\nNeurosciences, therefore, can be\u00a0applied to several areas beyond management and economics (Ma and Wang, 2006). In the selling area it allows to understand the brain answer to several stimuli to capture which strategy can lead to the buying decision (Russo and Gabrielli, 2022). Studies on consumer behavior and decision-making processes, suggest that assessment based on the registration of neurophysiological parameters can show reliable results because they lack the mediation of cognitive processes (Poels and DeWitte, 2006; Missaglia et\u00a0 al., 2017). When applied to marketing issues, neuroscience can capture and discover what is happening in the brain in response to several advertising or communication stimuli and, in turn, can lead to the understanding of buying process (Ciceri et\u00a0 al., 2019; Russo et\u00a0 al., 2020). In that regard, this method has proven to be\u00a0able to predict the purchase behavior and preferences of the population by generalizing the results obtained from the experimental sample (Dmochowski et\u00a0al., 2014; Barnett and Cerf, 2017; Christoforou et\u00a0al., 2017; Zito et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, neuroscience techniques, in their attempt to interpret reality based on cognitive schemes and experienced emotions and on the detection of decision-making process, can be\u00a0applied in any\ncommunication exchange activating a detectable and observable reaction (Plassmann et\u00a0 al., 2015; Bazzani et\u00a0 al., 2020). Moreover, studies suggest that the neural science applied to financial decisionmaking, becomes a science overcoming the only psychological aspects, even deepening the mind of the decision-maker, trying to understand realistic functioning of the decision instances to explain a larger area of the individual economic behaviors (Vasile and Sebastian, 2007).\nAn important element that can affect the decision process and the relationships between subjects, thus affecting the emotional side and, consequently, the selling-buying process, is trust. Trust has been defined for a long time as a condition in interpersonal selling, but the possibility to personalize the service or the product even on the internet or non-store direct selling is also important for the trust occurrence (Young and Albaum, 2003). According to these studies, in the marketing area the possibility to have trust is psychologically linked to the management of uncertainty and, in the specific case of this study, where the direct relationship is not tangible, but credibility and trust are so central, the seller\u2019s behavior and style is crucial. On this issue, studies suggest that the seller\u2019s communication style differs by gender (McQuiston and Morris, 2009), and communication style affects attraction. Indeed, the ability of sellers to adapt their communication style to customers is a crucial factor (Alavi et\u00a0al., 2019), as it has been observed that people decode persuasive messages according to different styles that assign importance to dissimilar aspects of communication. For instance, these styles include the well-known division in \u201cselective-processors\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive-processors\u201d (Meyers-Levy and Loken, 2015). Similarly, it has been shown that socio-demographic properties such as gender (Levy and Sharma, 1994) and relational variables like trust are also relevant factors in selling (Palmatier et\u00a0 al., 2006). Due to these considerations, it appears necessary to investigate how the seller\u2019s gender, communication style, and trust are intertwined with the subjects\u2019 emotional reactions. Emotional reactions in the seller/buyer relationship have been understudied due to the challenge of measuring emotions (Young and Albaum, 2003). However, consumer neuroscience can fill this gap by examining both conscious and unconscious decision-making processes that influence behavior (Hazeldine, 2014).\nIn fact, measuring an emotional reaction to an advertisement with these techniques allows for real-time detection of the most spontaneous aspects of consumers\u2019 emotional reactions, through variation in body parameters that reflect emotional activation (Damasio, 1994; Vitouch, 1997; Bechara et\u00a0al., 2000; Larsen et\u00a0al., 2003; Poels and DeWitte, 2006; Posner, 2006; Kenning et\u00a0al., 2007). For example, a study conducted using neuromarketing techniques, showed that listening to radio advertisement subsequently leads to spending more time and more involvement in watching the advertised brand or the same spot on TV (Russo et\u00a0al., 2020). Neuromarketing techniques have proven useful in choosing the most effective commercial in terms of liking and ability to activate mnemonic processes (Russo et\u00a0al., 2022). For instance, in Unicef commercials, the detection of emotional responses through neuromarketing tools captured both emotional intensity and cognitive engagement. The modification of the commercials led to a 35 percent increase in donations (Zito et\u00a0al., 2021). For this reason, the use of neuromarketing techniques over the years has had increasing interest (Lee et\u00a0al., 2007).\nAccording to literature on neuroselling and its relevance on several areas, sales techniques have also become subject of interest outside real-world contexts, demonstrating that they can exert a persuasive\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\neffect even within mediated relationships, as in the case of teleshopping (Ca\u00f1izares Stay and Ca\u00f1izares Stay, 2018). Teleshopping, which consists of the purchase of products or services through the medium of television, has proved to be\u00a0one of the fastest growing forms of marketing in the last 20 years (Bouhlel, 2019) and is a privileged place where persuasive techniques are implemented. As numerous studies have shown, the ability of media sellers to establish a relationship with consumers is determined by psychological phenomena called parasocial interaction (PSI) and parasocial relationship (PSR). PSI, on the one hand, refers to the reaction a media user has toward the performer, such that the user perceives the performer as a relational partner. PSR, on the other hand, is inherent in a lasting relationship that the user establishes with the media performer (Dibble et\u00a0al., 2016). Both of these constructs are favored by the behavioral styles enacted by the TV performer. In reference to this, the literature on teleshopping has identified a number of persuasion techniques used by salespeople that relate to both the rhetorical styles and psychological factors of the consumer. Fritchie and Johnson (2003) verified that teleshopping programs regularly used the 6 sales strategies identified by Robert Cialdini (1993) by measuring their prevalence in 23 programs. The results showed that 35.5% of the channels adopted the technique of social proof, 28.4% scarcity, 18.4% authority, 9.1% commitment and consistency, 6.1% liking, and 2.0% reciprocity. Cortese and Rubin (2010) found that people who make more planned purchases tend to look at the commercial aspects of the medium but did not perceive an interpersonal connection with the presenters. In the same study, those who purchased more items were motivated to watch the commercial aspects of the TV medium. Kline (2005) has found that teleshopping programs resort to a number of rhetorical styles aimed at influencing the viewer\u2019s decision-making process. In particular, scholars have identified 5 classes of rhetorical styles called \u201cconstruction of trustworthy relationships,\u201d \u201cseeking consensus through inquiry and advocacy,\u201d \u201ccreating a believable reality for product worth,\u201d \u201cstaging impressive messages for viewers,\u201d and \u201cfacilitating teleshopper commitment.\u201d Trusting relationships are created by the salesperson either by communicating praise, inclusion, and interest to the viewers, or by verbally expressing their own feelings and aspects of their personal life. Seeking consensus was achieved by stimulating the audience\u2019s needs and desires to which the seller provided the solution through the product. Creating a believable reality for product worth was ensured by providing factual information on product properties, such as materials, dimensions, and the production process. Impressive messages relied on emphasizing the pronunciation of words, using colorful terms and descriptions that dramatized product features. Teleshoppers\u2019 commitment to purchase was stimulated through certain heuristics highlighting the exceptionality of the low price and the scarcity of the product. According to scholars, sellers tend to combine several of these communicative styles simultaneously, a concept that has been called \u201clamination\u201d (Kline, 2005). The salesperson, as a persuader, has to adopt effective persuasive strategies by adapting to the particular needs of the target customer. He\u00a0has to get to know his customer and, prioritizing the customer\u2019s interests, design customized strategies for approaching, attracting attention, and satisfying needs. Numerous studies have shown that trustworthiness is directly related to persuasion and message effectiveness. A review by Pornpitakpan (2004) on source credibility and its effects on persuasion indicates the superiority of a high-credibility source over a low-credibility one: the more reliable a communicator is, the more effective his or her opinion will be\u00a0to the receiver of the message. In addition, the results of one study confirmed that the perceived credibility of the source indirectly affects purchase intention (Muda and Hamzah, 2021). Babin et\u00a0al. (2004) studied how customers form ethical perceptions while interacting with a salesperson and the consequent effects of these perceptions on customer emotions and purchase intentions. They found that moral fairness (a customer\u2019s perception of being treated fairly by a salesperson) promotes positive emotions and inhibits negative emotions. Moreover, they observed how positive emotions increase customers\u2019 future purchase intentions while negative emotions reduce them. One of the main tools for the salesperson in this process is language. For Verschueren (1999), the use of language must consist of the continuous making of language choices. According to this author, choices are mainly based on 3 characteristics: variability, negotiability, and adaptability (Verschueren, 1999). Variability allows the user to make choices at all levels of language structure. Negotiability is responsible for highly flexible principles and strategies underlying choices. Lastly, adaptability allows humans to make negotiable language choices and approach points of communicative need satisfaction. Many of these characteristics were found in a study analyzing TV shopping (Huang, 2019). The results of another study analyzing the relationship between TV shopping and antecedent motivations in media use through the uses-andgratifications theory (U&G, a user-centered approach that focuses on how people use media for their own personal uses and gratification) perspective, suggest that TV viewers watch TV shopping because they are motivated by a convenient, cheap and fast way to shop, learn about products and finally, they want to be\u00a0entertained (Cortese and Rubin, 2010). Finally, other persuasive levers are related to the upward social mobility ensured by the product (e.g., high-end articles) (Cook, 2000), the pressure exerted by the reduced time within which to decide on a purchase (Auter and Moore, 1993), and the possibility to easily return the product and be\u00a0 refunded (Hariramani, 2018). At the level of psychological variables, just as in real sales contexts, in the case of mediated relationships, trust has been shown to be\u00a0a facilitating factor in the purchase decision (Bouhlel, 2019). In addition, customer satisfaction showed to be\u00a0correlated with perceived value, convenience, and product variety (Sahai et\u00a0al., 2020), although only convenience has been shown to be\u00a0predictive. Currently, it is important to explore what determines communication effectiveness in terms of sales. In fact, most of the research conducted on the communication style of salespeople dates back to the 1980s and 1990s. For this reason, many of these studies do not take into account the influence that new technologies can have on sales. Indeed, there has been a shift from seller\u2013buyer communication to computer-buyer communication (Chaganti et\u00a0al., 2017). The availability of product details, reviews, customer satisfaction ratings, and so on, are so comprehensive that they have the potential to trigger a decision on the part of the customer, thus minimizing the communication needs in the seller\u2013buyer interaction (Chaganti et\u00a0al., 2017)."

Forty Ag/AgCl electrodes were placed at locations Fp1, FpZ, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, Ft7, Fc3, Fcz, Fc4, Ft8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, Tp7, Cp3, Cpz, Cp4, Tp8, A1, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, A2, P5, P6, Po7, Po3, Poz, Po4, Po8, O1, Oz, O2, according to the international 10\u201310 system (Jurcak et\u00a0al., 2007). The ground electrode was placed on the left mastoid, and the reference was calculated from the auricular electrodes A1-A2: left channels were referred to A1, right channels to A2, and middle channels to the mean (A1 + A2)/2. Before electrode placement, the skin was abraded with Nu Prep gel (Spes Medica, S.r.l). Then, Neurgel gel (Spes Medica, S.r.l.) was used to lower the electrode impedance below 20k\u03a9.\nThe EEG signal was processed using Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) and the EEGLab toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004): first, it was re-referenced to CAR (Common Average Reference), bandpass filtered between 2 and 48 Hz, and notch filtered at 50 and 100 Hz. An Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was performed using the FastICA algorithm. Once obtained (Independent Components) were\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\ncategorized by ICLabel, a neural network classifier (Pion-Tonachini et\u00a0al., 2019): ICs identified as not \u201cbrain\u201d with probability greater than 0.7 were labeled as \u201cartifacts.\u201d \u201cArtifact\u201d ICs were removed, and the signal was back-projected into sensor space. ICA, classification, removal of ICs, and back-projection were performed a second time to eliminate residual artifacts.\nFor each subject, the Individual Alpha Frequency (IAF) was estimated as the center of gravity within the [7.5 Hz; 12.5 Hz] band of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) averaged across all the occipital channels (Klimesch, 1999). The PSD was estimated within the EYC baseline, following the Welch\u2019s approach based on a 1 s-long hamming window and 50% of overlapping. Theta(\u03b8), Alpha (\u03b1), Beta (\u03b2) and Gamma (\u03b3) bands were defined, according to the estimated IAF, as: \u03b8 = [IAF-6; IAF-6], \u03b1 = [IAF-2; IAF + 2], \u03b2 = [IAF + 2; IAF + 16] and \u03b3 = [IAF + 16; IAF + 25] (Borghini et\u00a0al., 2019).\nThe following EEG metrics were finally calculated to assess neurocognitive reaction to target stimuli:\n\u2212 Approach Withdrawal Index (AWI), computed as the difference of \u03b1 powers between right and left prefrontal channels. It is a well-known measure of motivational tendency: positive AWI values are related to a cognitive approach toward the stimulus, while negative ones are related to cognitive withdrawal (Davidson et\u00a0al., 1990). \u2212 Willingness to Pay Index (WPI), computed as the difference of \u03b3 powers between right and left prefrontal channels. It was derived from a study by Rams\u00f8y et\u00a0al. (2018) that positively correlated it to the respondents\u2019 willingness to pay. \u2212 Beta over Alpha plus Theta Ratio (BATR), computed as the ratio between \u03b2 group powers and the sum of \u03b1 and \u03b8 powers of all of the EEG channels. It has been proposed as a measure of Cognitive Engagement (Freeman et\u00a0al., 1999). \u2212 Beta over Alpha Ratio index (BAR), computed as the ratio between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 powers of all the EEG channels. It has been proposed as a measure of emotional arousal (McQuiston and Morris, 2009).\nThese metrics were calculated using the spectrogram approach and consisted in time-signals with 0.5 s of temporal resolution (Gabrielli et\u00a0 al., 2020). After the metric computation, a z-scored transform according to the mean value and the standard deviation computed within the BSL baseline was first applied; then, the transformed signals were epoched according to the commercial\u2019s onset and offset. The epoched signal was thus segmented into three parts that were found homogeneous in both the commercials: an initial part, where the seller gives a gentle introduction to both the company and the product; a central part, where the seller details the unique features of the product, the product bundling and the payment options; a final part, that consists in the call-to-action. The signal was finally averaged within the segments, to get, for each metric, three mean values named <X > InitialSection, <X > CentralSection, and < X > FinalSection, where <X > is the metric name (i.e., AWI, WPI, BATR or BAR). This splitting procedure allows the assessment of the individual contributions of the narrative parts on the Call-to-Action, Purchase Intention, and infomercial Likeability, avoiding any masking effect due to a temporal average of the overall commercial (Russo et\u00a0al., 2022)."

            "text": "This study tried to understand the impact of some variables in the selling process through neuromarketing techniques. Tools used by neuromarketing, indeed, allow to capture the emotional reactions and dynamics occurring when subjects are stimulated and are involved in a decision process. As mentioned, neuroscience tools can be\u00a0 applied in any communication exchange activating a detectable and observable reaction (Plassmann et\u00a0al., 2015; Bazzani et\u00a0al., 2020).\nSelling is not deeply explored from this point of view and neuroscience can be\u00a0a key factor to detect the reactions of consumers. This is particularly crucial considering that consumers use mainly three areas of the brain, related to visual, emotional, and rational responses (Hill and Simon, 2010). Therefore, detecting also the emotional and non-verbal aspects of the consumers\u2019 responses is crucial and neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience tools can cover this important aspect. In this sense, the evaluation of the reactions can be\u00a0 effectively detected in real time through neuromarketing techniques without the mediation of the cognitive side. This is a key point since they give instruments to have different interpretations between emotions really experienced and the rational side, with the possibility to observe the processing of information considering the role played by emotions (Passyn and Sujan, 2006).\nThis study, therefore, applied neuroscience to selling in a neuroselling point of view, to understand reactions in the selling process while looking at teleshopping communication as literature described this as growing (Bouhlel, 2019), characterized by a high level of trust, credibility, persuasion and by several relational elements (Dibble et\u00a0 al., 2016; Muda and Hamzah, 2021). Understanding dynamics in such types of communication and the effect on consumers can contribute to understanding human reactions in this variable setting and, moreover, in optimizing sellers\u2019 effectiveness and increasing sales from a business perspective.\nAs for data, among the performed analyses some interesting results emerged. Regression analyses suggested that subjects were pushed to call the number to obtain information about the infomercial, particularly by the seller performance and the WPI in the initial part of the teleshopping. These elements are crucial to allow consumers to get into a relationship with both the seller and the product. A seller that communicates credibility and makes effective persuasive communications, can be\u00a0a precious source for selling success and consumer trust (Pornpitakpan, 2004; Muda and Hamzah, 2021). Moreover, WPI in the initial part has a role in enhancing Call-toAction, whereas WPI in the central part has a role in decreasing Call to Action, maybe because of the too much information, and the repetitiveness of this part of the teleshopping which may have bored viewers. These results suggest the importance of monitoring information at the beginning of the viewed teleshopping as each phase can significantly contribute to the WPI and buying behavior as suggested by other researchers (Sahai et\u00a0al., 2020; Russo et\u00a0al., 2022).\nPurchase Intention seems to be\u00a0influenced by the affective side of trust in sellers, revealing not only the importance of trustworthiness when buying without tangible elements (as in the teleshopping), but also the relevance of the relationship emerging by the affective evaluation that consumers are doing while observing the seller. In particular in teleshopping, as highlighted by Kline (2005), trust and\nrelationship create sense, believability, stimulate the audience and create consensus and engagement around the products. This is in line with the other data that can influence the Purchase Intention: AWI in the initial phase. As it has a motivational side and is linked to the approach to a stimulus, this significant data may suggest that relation in the first impact and approach is a crucial evaluative element. In this analysis, BAR has a negative effect in purchase intention again in the initial phase and this would be\u00a0in line with the previous data: being in trust and in relationship with the seller have an effect on consumers and on the intention to approach the product, but the communication should not be\u00a0excessively exciting. In order to promote the product and to be\u00a0persuasive, the communication style should be\u00a0professional and put at their ease the consumer through technical knowledge (Futrell, 2006).\nFinally, the infomercial likeability seems to be\u00a0influenced only by BATR in the initial phase of the viewed teleshopping. This is a crucial element considering that cognitive engagement can have an important role on the evaluation of a product, on buying behavior and even in the creation of a sort of brand or product love (Shin and Back, 2020).\nConsidering Eye-Tracker results, the Time Spent on the logo, on the Discount and on the Price show significant correlation with WPI. Only the logo shows a significant correlation with AWI. As WPI, the selected AOIs show the importance of the recognizable logo and of the clear and visible price and discount as crucial elements for the possibility of buying from the consumers. Not only, this measure is linked also to the evaluation of convenience that subjects can make thanks to the possibility of having clear information about the product, its costs, and characteristics (Russo et\u00a0 al., 2021). AWI is significantly correlated only with the logo AOI and this could be\u00a0an element linked to trust: having clear information about the company while buying at a distance can be\u00a0reassuring.\nGender does not produce different effects among the two infomercials. This aspect suggests a homogeneity between the two infomercials and a good narrative structure that vehiculates the information in an effective way considering the Time Spent on the selected AOI and data on Call-to-Action, Purchase Intention, and Infomercial Likeability.\nThis study highlights important elements in particular the relationship and trust that the seller can communicate while selling. Many elements can be\u00a0monitored, such as the ability to communicate in a professional and emotional way. In particular, results on performance suggest the importance of monitoring and developing the seller\u2019s performance. A contemporary and systematic review of the literature on the characteristics of effective salespeople found that personal, organizational, collaborative, buyer, and situational dimensions are responsible for increasing salespeople\u2019s performance (Herjanto and Franklin, 2019). However, there is little exploration of the competencies of an effective sales representative in the existing literature (Ben Amor, 2019). Some recent research has examined the determinants of salesperson performance (Ahearne and Schillewaert, 2000; Johlke, 2006). An interesting work by Rentz et\u00a0al. (2002) proposes three dimensions that have to be\u00a0 considered in sales skills: interpersonal skills, communication style skills, and technical skills. More specifically, interpersonal skills correspond to listening, empathy, optimism, and perceived observation skills. Studies have shown a significant and positive relationship between\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\nthese sub-dimensions and performance (Rich and Smith, 2000; Rapisarda, 2002). Communication style skills refer to the ability to sell or persuade people to buy (adaptability, negotiation, and questioning, the salesperson\u2019s communication style, and consultative selling). They are fundamental to making a sales presentation and closing the sale (Manning and Reece, 2004). Finally, technical skills correspond to the ability of salespeople to provide information about the design, specifications, applications, and functions of products or services (Churchill et\u00a0 al., 2000; Futrell, 2006). The use of technical knowledge induces higher salesperson performance. Monitoring these aspects can be\u00a0important for both the consumers that have the possibility to face professional sellers, and the company for the sales success from a business perspective.\nThe study\u2019s limitations are related to a small sample size and a focus on specific infomercials. Enlarging the sample size could be\u00a0useful also to explore other effects that in this study were not significant or very close to significance, in particular in the closing part of the teleshopping. However, according to Jenkins and Quintana-Ascencio (2020), the sample size is in line with studies based on biological data and also with the recommendation for regression models of N\u00a0= 8 with low variance, and a minimum of N\u00a0= 25 for high variance, as in the present study. Nevertheless, as this is a first study on teleshopping, we\u00a0argue that future research could explore other infomercial types and further examine seller communication styles to assess other identification or approachwithdrawal effects. Additionally, it\u2019s important to dig into which specific aspects of seller performance could have the potential to enhance Purchase Intention and Call-to-Action. Future studies should consider more variables to undertake a more exhaustive exploration of seller performance, thereby uncovering the distinct dimensions of seller performance that could yield a positive impact on the overall infomercial success.\nMoreover, we\u00a0 decided not to investigate whether the brand, salesperson, or adv was already known by the participants since we\u00a0 wanted to ensure that participant\u2019s responses to the stimuli remained unaffected. In fact, topics like the salesperson or brand should be\u00a0the focus of future research.\nFinally, traditional techniques (questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups), can provide a variety of information about an emotional reaction, from a conscious perspective (Micu and Plummer, 2010). Neuroscientific measures, on the other hand, provide an output of emotional experience that is not mediated by cognitive processing (Poels and DeWitte, 2006) or distorted by cognitive bias (Haley et\u00a0al., 1994). Indeed, sometimes people omit or alter their responses in order to safeguard their image and express what is considered most socially acceptable (Edwards, 1957; Merlowe and Crowne, 1961; Crosby et\u00a0al., 1980; DeMaio, 1984; Paulhus, 1984; Maass et\u00a0al., 2000; Roccato and Zogmaister, 2010). In addition, participants\u2019 responses may be\u00a0 unintentionally distorted due to limitations in the ability to introspect (Greenwald and Banaji, 1995; Boca, 1996; Kitawaki and Hiromi, 1998; Banaji and Mahzarin, 2001) and difficulties in verbally expressing emotions (Penn, 2006). Therefore, the combination of the two approaches should be\u00a0considered necessary and complementary. The lack of reliable approaches to anticipate consumer behavior can generate significant consequences. In fact, it is estimated that\nbetween 40 and 80% of new products introduced to the market are unsuccessful, causing economic damage to companies that translates into losses of billions of dollars (Castellion and Markham, 2012; Hakim and Levy, 2019). In the future, the integration of other traditional techniques side by side with neuroscientific ones may elucidate new and as yet little known aspects on the topic.\nDespite its limitations, this project is a noteworthy pilot study that highlights crucial emotional aspects of the seller/buyer relationship that can affect sales decisions, relationships, and outcomes. Moreover, this study gives an important contribution to defining neuroselling as a discipline. Neuromarketing techniques give this project a novel and pioneering edge as they reveal unknown emotional reactions and improve understanding of factors affecting decision-making, leading to a reevaluation of communication dynamics for better business performance."
