conclusion This paper proposes a fault correlation analysis method based on secondary filtering. Based on the AES-128 algorithm of the MCU, we conducted experiments and achieved key recovery using 10 fault probability traces. Compared with the existing CPA methods, 2F-FPCA has
the following advantages:
1) It is less affected by noise. We choose the FPHW model, which does not need to collect ciphertext and only pays attention to the response of the attack. 2) The correct key is of apparent characteristics. The correlation coefficient between the actual fault probability corresponding to the correct key and the hypothetical fault probability value based on the FPHW model is as high as -1. 3) The computational complexity is low. We select plaintexts with different HW of S-box output and POIs to reduce the number of traces and sampling points. Therefore, the computational complexity is significantly reduced, improving the attack efficiency. Due to the difference in cryptographic algorithms and selection methods, the selection results of POIs are different. At the same time, we consider expanding the
range of cryptographic algorithms targeted by attacks.
