    "abstractText": "Propagation of a localised wave function of a massive scalar field is investigated in its rest frame. The complete orthogonal Hermite-Gauss basis is presented, and the Gouy phase and Rayleigh scale notions are adapted. The leading and sub-leading gravitational corrections to a localised quantum wave function propagating in a generally curved spacetime geometry are calculated within the Fermi coordinates around the time-like geodesic of its rest frame, and cross-talk coefficients among the modes are derived. It is observed that spherically symmetric modes propagate along the geodesic. However, non-spherical modes are found to experience a mode-dependent residual quantum force at the sub-leading order. It is shown that the residual force does not generate an escape velocity for in-falling wave functions but leads to a mode-dependent deflection angle for the scattered ones.",

The complete orthogonal Hermite-Gauss basis is presented, and the Gouy phase and Rayleigh scale notions are adapted. The leading and sub-leading gravitational corrections to a localised quantum wave function propagating in a generally curved spacetime geometry are calculated within the Fermi coordinates around the time-like geodesic of its rest frame, and cross-talk coefficients among the modes are derived. It is observed that spherically symmetric modes propagate along the geodesic. However, non-spherical modes are found to experience a mode-dependent residual quantum force at the sub-leading order. It is shown that the residual force does not generate an escape velocity for in-falling wave functions but leads to a mode-dependent deflection angle for the scattered ones."

            "text": "The advancement of exchanging quantum information over long distances [1\u20135] and the efforts to establish a quantum network in space [6, 7] have stemmed various studies to calculate the general relativistic corrections to the photon\u2019s wave function around the Earth or in a general background [8\u201314] and viability of quantum communication across interstellar distances is reported [15]. In particular, the authors of this manuscript utilize Fermi coordinates [16] adapted to null geodesics [17] and report technologically measurable quantities beyond the light ray approximation [18, 19]. Since these studies have considered the propagation of a wave function of massless particles along a null geodesic, one may ponder how a wave function of a massive particle propagates in a general curved spacetime geometry. The gravitational corrections for an electron bound to a stationary or nonstationary hydrogen atom in a curved spacetime geometry have been investigated [20\u201326]. However, the advancement of the structured quantum matter waves [27\u2013 29] encourages examining the general relativistic corrections for a wave function of a freely propagating massive particle. We notice that the effects of constant Newtonian gravity are studied in [30]. Here, we calculate the interaction between the Riemann tensor with the wave function of a localised massive field freely propagating along an arbitrary time-like geodesic in a general curved spacetime geometry.\nThe paper is organised as follows: Section 2 considers a localised wave function of a massive scalar field propagating in the flat Minkowski spacetime geometry. It generalises the concept of a rest frame of a particle to a rest frame of a wave function, and defines the rest frame of a wave function as the frame wherein the expectation value of the linear momentum vanishes. Section 3 stud-\n\u2217Electronic address: qexirifa@uottawa.ca \u2020Electronic address: ekarimi@uottawa.ca\nies the Klein-Gordon equation for a massive particle in the rest frame of the wave function. It considers the low energy modes and approximates the Klein-Gordon equation to the Schrodinger equation in (3 + 1)-dimensions. Section 3.1 reviews how to find a complete basis for the localized solutions of the Schrodinger equation in (1+1)- dimensions, and adapts the notion of the Gouy phase [31] and Rayleigh scale. Section 3.2 presents the elegant Hermite basis, and Section 3.3 reviews the standard Hermite modes and their properties. Section 3.4 presents the standard Hermite-Gaussian modes in (3 + 1)-dimensions as a complete orthogonal basis for the localised wave function of a massive particle.\nSection 4 considers a localised wave function of a massive particle propagating in a general curved spacetime geometry. It utilises the Fermi coordinates adapted to the time-like geodesic of the rest frame of the wave function up to the cubic order in terms of transverse directions [32, 33]. The equation for the interaction between the curvature of the spacetime geometry is obtained. The interaction introduces a cross-talk between different modes and induces a distortion which is encoded in the operator Q presented in (118). The distortion operator at the quadratic and cubic orders are calculated in (117) and (145) and expressed in terms of the Riemann tensor and its covariant derivative evaluated and integrated over the time-like geodesic of the rest frame. Section 4.1.2 utilises Newton\u2019s Lex Secunda to define the residual net force acting on the wave function \u03a8 given by the time rate of the change of its average linear momentum. It reports that the residual net force vanishes at the level of quadratic corrections. Section 4.2 shows that the net residual force generally does not vanish at the order of the cubic corrections for a general wave function. The net residual force vanishes for spherical symmetric wave functions, so they follow the time-like geodesic of their rest frame. Non-spherically symmetric wave functions are found to experience a net residual force, and their mean trajectory deviates from the geodesic.\nSection 5 studies the Schwarzschild black hole [34] as an example of curved spacetime geometry. Section 5.1 calculates the net residual force for a localised wave func-\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n13 18\n2v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 3\nM ar\n2 02\n3\n2 tion of a massive particle radially falling inside the black hole. It shows that though the force is not vanishing, as long as the width of the wave function on and outside the event horizon remains negligible compared to the Schwarzschild radius, the residual force does generate an escape velocity. Section 5.1 shows the effect of the residual force on the trajectory of a wave function deflected by the black hole. It reveals that different modes are deflected by an angle that depends on the mode number. Section 6 concludes that the computed dependency of the deflection of the mode number in the solar system is too small to be measured by available technologies. However, the finding that the trajectories of localised quantum wave functions deviate from geodesics may be counted as evidence supporting the idea that gravity should not be treated as a geometrical force in the quantum realm."

            "text": "We consider \u03d5(t, z1, z2, z3) as a free complex-valued scalar field in the flat (3+1)-dimensional spacetime where the length of line element in the spacetime is given by:\nds2 = \u03b7\u00b5\u03bddz \u00b5dz\u03bd = \u2212c2dt2 + dzidzi, (1)\nwhere \u00b5, \u03bd \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}, i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd represents the components of the Minkowski metric, c is the light speed, dz0 = ct, t represents time and zi represent space, and if a single index appears twice in a term, then summation is performed over that index.\nThe action for \u03d5 is given by: S[\u03d5] = \u2212 \u222b d4z ( \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202z\u00b5\u03d5\u2202z\u03bd\u03d5 \u2217 + ~2m2\nc2 \u03d5\u03d5\u2217\n) , (2)\nwhere \u03d5 = \u03d5(zi, t), \u03d5\u2217 is the complex conjugate of \u03d5, \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd is the inverse of the metric, \u2202z\u00b5 = \u2202 \u2202z\u00b5 , d 4z = dz0dz1dz2dz3, and m is the mass while ~ represents the reduced Planck constant. Requiring that the functional variation of the action with respect to \u03d5 vanishes, generates the equation of motion of \u03d5:\n\u03b4S[\u03d5]\n\u03b4\u03d5 = 0\u2192\n( \u2212 ~ 2m2\nc2\n) \u03d5(t, zi) = 0, (3)\nwhere = \u2212\u220220 +\u22022i . In natural units wherein ~ = c = 1, the equation of motion is simplified to:\n(\u2212\u22022t + \u22022i \u2212m2)\u03d5(t, zi) = 0. (4)\nWhile negative energy solutions and quantum field theory aspects can become relevant in curved spacetime, we emphasize that in the regime under consideration, the energy density and curvature of spacetime are sufficiently small that any potential effects of these solutions are expected to be negligible. Moreover, the specific physical processes we are considering do not involve significant particle production. Therefore, we only consider positive\nenergy solutions to the equation of motion, which can be presented as follows:\n\u03d5(t, zi) =\n\u222b d3p\n(2\u03c0) 3 2\nA(~p)eip\u00b5z \u00b5 , (5)\nwhere p\u00b5 = (E~p, ~p), p\u00b5z \u00b5 = \u2212E~pt+ pizi, and E~p = \u221a m2 + p21 + p 2 2 + p 2 3. (6)\nWe choose \u03d5 to be normalized, i.e.,\n1 = \u222b d3z |\u03d5|2 = \u222b d3p |A(~p)|2 . (7)\nSo |A(~p)|2 can be interpreted as the probability for the particle to have momentum ~p. We refer to t, zi as the coordinates in the lab. The average momentum in the lab is given by:\n~p lab = \u3008~p\u3009lab = \u222b d3p |A(~p)|2 ~p. (8)\nWithout loss of generality, coordinates can be chosen such that momentum aligns with the positive direction of z3:\n~p lab = (0, 0, p lab ), (9)\nwith plab > 0. Let us consider a boost with velocity of v = (v1, v2, v3), which is given by the following Lorentz transformation:\n\u039b\u00b5\u03bd =  \u03b3 \u2212\u03b3v1 \u2212\u03b3v2 \u2212\u03b3v3 \u2212\u03b3v1 (\u03b3\u22121)v 2 1 v2 + 1 (\u03b3\u22121)v1v2 v2 (\u03b3\u22121)v1v3 v2\n\u2212\u03b3v2 (\u03b3\u22121)v1v2v2 (\u03b3\u22121)v22 v2 + 1 (\u03b3\u22121)v2v3 v2 \u2212\u03b3v3 (\u03b3\u22121)v1v3v2 (\u03b3\u22121)v2v3 v2 (\u03b3\u22121)v23 v2 + 1  , (10)\nwhere \u03b3 is the boost factor, \u03b3 = 1\u221a 1\u2212v2 , and v =\u221a\nv21 + v 2 2 + v 2 3 . We represent the new coordinates by\nx\u00b5 = (\u03c4, x1, x2, x3):\nx\u00b5 = \u039b\u00b5\u03bdz \u03bd . (11)\nThe Fourier transformation of \u03d5(\u03c4, xi) is given by:\n\u03d5(\u03c4, xi) =\n\u222b d3q\n(2\u03c0) 3 2\nA\u0303(~q)eiq\u00b5x \u00b5 , (12)\nwhere ~q is the momentum in the x-frame and A\u0303(~q) is the amplitude for momentum ~q. Since \u03d5 is scalar, its value in the x-frame is given by \u03d5(\u03c4, xi) = \u03d5(t, zi) which implies:\nA\u0303(~q) = \u2202(p1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , pD) \u2202(q1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , qD) A(~p), (13)\nwhere \u2202(p1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,pD)\u2202(q1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,qD) is the Jacobian determinate. It can be simplified to:\n\u2202(p1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , pD) \u2202(q1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , qD) = E~p \u03b3(E~p \u2212 p.v) , (14)\n3 where p.v = \u2211 i pivi, \u03b3 = 1\u221a 1\u2212|v|2 is the boost factor where ~v is the velocity of frame x with respect to the frame of z, and E~p is given in Eq. (6). The average of momentum in the x frame is defined by:\n\u3008q\u00b5\u3009x = \u222b d3q \u2223\u2223\u2223A\u0303(~q)\u2223\u2223\u22232 q\u00b5, (15) which is equal to:\n\u3008q\u00b5\u3009x = \u039b\u00b5\u03bd \u03b3 \u3008 E~p p \u03bd E~p \u2212 p.v \u3009lab. (16)\nHere, subscript x stands for the expectation value in the x frame. We define the rest frame of a wave function as a frame wherein the expectation values of the linear momentum vanishes:\n\u3008q1\u3009rest = \u3008q2\u3009rest = \u3008q3\u3009rest = 0, (17)\nwhere the subscript of rest stands for the rest frame. Substituting Eq. (16) in Eq. (17) provides three equations that can be solved to find ~v = (v1, v2, v3). In (1 + 1) dimensions, we can prove that for any differentiable A(~p), there always exists one solution that satisfies |~v| < 1. We conjecture that for any infinitely differentiable A(~p), Eq. (17) admits only one solution for ~v that satisfies |~v| < 1. We call this unique solution as the rest frame of the wave function.\nAs an example, let us consider a simple Gaussian profile for A(p) with the variance of \u03c3 around \u3008~p\u3009lab = (0, 0, p\u0304):\nA(~p) = 1\n\u03c0 3 4\u03c3 3 2\nexp ( \u2212p 2 1 + p 2 2 + (p3 \u2212 p\u0304)2\n\u03c32\n) . (18)\nThe symmetric distribution of the wave function in the z1 and z2 plane implies that the velocity of the rest frame holds:\nv1 = v2 = 0. (19)\nThen the equation for v3 can be simplified to:\nv3\n\u2329 m2 + p21 + p\n2 2\u221a\nm2 + p21 + p 2 2 + p 2 3 \u2212 p3v3 \u232a lab = p\u0304. (20)\nThis equation cannot be solved in an exact analytic form. However, when \u03c3 is small, i.e., (\u03c32 p\u03042 + m2), the perturbative solution can be found:\nv3 = p\u0304\u221a\nm2 + p\u03042\n( 1\u2212 (m 2 + 2p\u03042)\n4(m2 + p\u03042)2 \u03c32 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n) . (21)\nThe above expression shows that the rest frame velocity not only depends on the average momentum but is a function of the internal structure of the wave function as it depends on \u03c3."

            "text": "To find a general localized solution for a wave function, we first consider the Schrod\u0308inger equation for a particle with mass m in (1 + 1)-dimensions of \u03c4 and x:\ni\u2202\u03c4 \u03d5\u0303+ 1\n2m \u22022x\u03d5\u0303 = 0. (27)\nLet it be emphasized that x is a variable defined only for the purpose of presenting the position in 1 + 1 dimensions. Equation (27) is a linear homogeneous partial differential equation. We assume that boundary conditions are linear and homogeneous too. This allows us to utilise the technique of separation of variables to solve Eq. (27). The technique of separation of variables tries to find a complete basis for the on-shell field configurations. We look for solutions in the form of:\n\u03d5\u0303(x, \u03c4) = \u03d5(xf(\u03c4)) g(\u03c4), (28)\nwhere \u03d5 and (f , g) are analytic. Substituting Eq. (28) in Eq. (27) yields:\n\u03d5\u2032\u2032(y) + \u03b1\u0303y\u03d5\u2032(y) + \u03b2\u0303\u03d5(y) = 0, (29)\n4 where \u03d5\u2032(y) \u2261 d\u03d5dy , \u03d5 \u2032\u2032(y) \u2261 d 2\u03d5 (dy)2 , and\ny \u2261 xf(\u03c4), (30) \u03b1\u0303 \u2261 2imf \u2032\nf3 , (31)\n\u03b2\u0303 \u2261 2img \u2032\nf2g , (32)\nwhere f \u2032 \u2261 dfd\u03c4 and g \u2032 \u2261 dgd\u03c4 . Notice that \u03b1\u0303, \u03b2\u0303 and y are variables defined within this section to concisely present the solution to (27). The technique of separation of vari-\nables demands that \u03b1\u0303 and \u03b2\u0303 should be constant. For a constant \u03b1\u0303, Eq. (31) can be solved to find f , which is given by,\nf(\u03c4) = \u00b1 \u221a m\ni\u03c4\u03b1\u0303+ c1 , (33)\nwhere c1 is the constant of integration. Parity operator in x (x\u2192 \u2212x) maps the positive sign of f(\u03c4) to its negative value. So without loss of generality, we can set:\nf(\u03c4) =\n\u221a m\ni\u03c4\u03b1\u0303+ c1 . (34)\nEquation (33) can be subsituted in Eq. (32), and thus g can be found as,\ng(\u03c4) = (i\u03c4 \u03b1\u0303+ c1) \u2212 \u03b2\u03032\u03b1\u0303 c2, (35)\nwhere c2 is the constant of integration. For constant \u03b1\u0303 and \u03b2\u0303, Eq. (29) can be utilized to find \u03d5(z):\ne \u03b1\u0303y2\n2 \u03d5(y) = C1H \u03b2\u0303\u2212\u03b1\u0303 \u03b1\u0303\n(\u221a \u03b1\u0303\n2 y\n)\n+ C2 1F1\n( \u2212 \u03b2\u0303 \u2212 \u03b1\u0303\n2\u03b1\u0303 ;\n1 2 ; \u03b1\u0303y2 2\n) , (36)\nwhere C1 and C2 are constants of integration, H \u03b2\u0303\u2212\u03b1\u0303 \u03b1\u0303 is the Hermite polynomial of degree \u03b2\u0303\u2212\u03b1\u0303\u03b1\u0303 , and 1F1 is the Kummer\u2019s (confluent hypergeometric) function. Kummer\u2019s function admits an irregular singular point at y = \u221e. We look for regular solutions at y =\u221e, and thus, we set C2 = 0, and obtain:\n\u03d5(y) = C1e \u2212 \u03b1\u0303y\n2\n2 H \u03b2\u0303\u2212\u03b1\u0303 \u03b1\u0303\n(\u221a \u03b1\u0303\n2 y\n) . (37)\nNotice that the technique of separation of variables aims to find a complete basis for all field configurations. The Hermite polynomials for non-negative integer values of \u03b2\u0303\u2212\u03b1\u0303 \u03b1\u0303 in (37) leads to a complete basis which in Optics is known as the Hermite Gaussian basis. In order to generate this basis, we set:\n\u03b2\u0303 = (n+ 1)\u03b1\u0303, (38) where n \u2208 {0}\u222aN. The finiteness of \u222b\u221e \u2212\u221e dx|\u03d5\u0303|\n2 demands \u03b1\u0303 > 0."

(55)\nIn the remaining of this section, we drop the subscript of w0 for the sake of simplicity, but we shall recover it in the next section. The standard Hermite modes provide a complete orthogonal basis for the physical Hilbert space:\n\u221e\u2211 n=0 |n\u3009\u3008n| = 1, (56)\n\u3008m|n\u3009 = \u03b4mn, (57)\nwhere \u03b4mn represents the Kronecker delta, and \u3008m|n\u3009 =\u222b\u221e \u2212\u221e dx \u3008m|x\u3009 \u3008x|n\u3009, and \u3008m|x\u3009 is the complex conjugate of \u3008x|m\u3009. The density plot of the first six modes is provided in Fig. 1. We observe that \u3008x|n\u3009 in the spacetime continuum is always composed of n + 1 strips. The phase of mode n can be re-expressed by:\narg(\u3008x|n\u3009) = a(\u03c4) ( x2\nw0\n) + \u03c8n(\u03c4), (58)\na(\u03c4) = \u03c4/\u03c4 R\n(1 + \u03c4/\u03c4 R\n)2 . (59)\nFigure 2 depicts a(\u03c4) and \u03c8n(\u03c4) versus \u03c4 .\nThe completeness of the standard Hermite basis implies that the wave function of the particle in its rest frame, as given in (23) and (41), can be written by:\n\u03d5(x, \u03c4) = e\u2212im\u03c4 \u221e\u2211 n=0 dn \u3008x|n\u3009 , (60)\nwhere dn are some constant complex numbers. So, let us first look at some physical properties of each mode. The expectation value of the kinetic energy of mode n is given by:\nEn = \u2212 1\n2m \u2329 n \u2223\u2223\u22022x|n\u232a = 1mw20 ( n+ 1 2 ) . (61)\nThe energy eigenvalues match that of a harmonic oscillator with frequency \u03c9 = 1\nmw20 . It also holds:\n\u2329 n \u2223\u2223x2|n\u232a = 2n+ 1\n4 w2, (62)\u2329 n \u2223\u2223p2|n\u232a = 2n+ 1\nw20 , (63)\nwhere w is the width of the wave function at the proper time \u03c4 defined in (53). Also, notice that it holds:\u2329\nn \u2223\u2223x2|m\u232a = w2\nw20\n\u2329 n \u2223\u2223x2|m\u232a\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03c4=0\n. (64)\nThe expectation values of the squared of position and momentum, therefore, satisfy:\u2329\nn \u2223\u2223p2|n\u232a \u2329n\u2223\u2223x2|n\u232a = (2n+ 1)2\n4\n( 1 + \u03c42\n\u03c42 R\n) , (65)\nwhere \u03c4 R is the Rayleigh time given in Eq. (52). Recalling that \u3008n|p|n\u3009 = \u3008n|x|n\u3009= 0, we see that the zero mode saturates the uncertainty principle at \u03c4 = 0. Also, notice that for any m,n and any arbitrary integer number of \u03b1\u0303:\n\u2329 n \u2223\u2223x\u03b1\u0303|m\u232a = ( w\nw0\n)\u03b1\u0303 ei(\u03c8n\u2212\u03c8m) \u2329 n \u2223\u2223x\u03b1\u0303|m\u232a\u2223\u2223\n\u03c4=0 ,\u2329 n \u2223\u2223p\u03b1\u0303|m\u232a = ei(\u03c8n\u2212\u03c8m) \u2329n\u2223\u2223p\u03b1\u0303|m\u232a\u2223\u2223\n\u03c4=0 , (66)\nwhere w is the width at time \u03c4 defined in Eq. (53), w0 is the initial width, and \u03c8n and \u03c8m are the Gouy phase for mode n and m defined in Eq. (54). To calculate the right-hand side of Eq. (66), one can define a new variable of y by:\ny\u0303 = \u221a 2 x\nw0 , (67) \u3008y\u0303|n\u3009 = ( ( \u2202x\n\u2202y )\n1 2 \u3008x|n\u3009 )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c4=0 , (68)\nthen \u3008y\u0303|n\u3009 satisfies:\u222b dy\u0303 |\u3008y\u0303|n\u3009|2 = 1, (69)(\n\u22121 2 \u22022y\u0303 + 1 2 y\u03032 ) \u3008y\u0303|n\u3009 = ( n+ 1 2 ) \u3008y\u0303|n\u3009 , (70)\n7 which can be perceived as the Hamiltonian of a simple harmonic oscillator with m = \u03c9 = 1. We can define the ladder operators of [37]:\na\u2020 = \u2212\u2202y\u0303 + y\u0303\u221a\n2 , (71)\na = \u2202y\u0303 + y\u0303\u221a\n2 , (72)\nthat satisfy [a, a\u2020] = 1 to alter the mode number:\na\u2020 |n\u3009 = \u221a n+ 1 |n+ 1\u3009 , (73) a |n+ 1\u3009 = \u221a n |n\u3009 . (74)\nwhich are useful to obtain the sandwich of x or p between two modes on the right-hand side of Eq. (66) by utilising:\nx = w0 2 (a+ a\u2020), (75) p = i(a\u2020 \u2212 a)\nw0 . (76)\nIn the following we would like to estimate the systematic error in ignoring second derivative of \u03c4 in (25), let us multiply both sides of (25) with \u03d5\u0303\u2217n and integrate it over x from x = \u2212\u221e,\u221e:\u2329\nn \u2223\u2223(i\u2202\u03c4 )2|n\u232a+ 2m \u3008n|i\u2202\u03c4 |n\u3009 \u2248 2m \u3008n|i\u2202\u03c4 |n\u3009 . (77)\nThe systematic error in this approximation is given by\nError(n) = \u2329 n \u2223\u2223H2|n\u232a\u2329\nn \u2223\u2223H2|n\u232a+ 2m \u3008n|H|n\u3009 , (78)\nwhere i\u2202\u03c4 = H is utilized and H = \u2212 12m\u2202 2 x represents the Hamiltonian. Using the explicit form of \u3008x|n\u3009 yields:\n\u3008n|H|n\u3009 = En, (79)\u2329 n \u2223\u2223H2|n\u232a = 6n2 + 6n+ 3\n4m2w40 , (80)\nwhich can be utilised to write:\n1\nError(n) = 1 + 4m2w20 3\n( 1\u2212 n 2\nn2 + n+ 12\n) . (81)\nAny experiment or measurement is performed with a certain precision. The systematic error should be always smaller than the precision, represented by pr:\nError(n) < pr, (82)\nThe precision is a very small positive real number: pr 1. So (81) can be rewritten by:\nn2\nn2 + n+ 12 < 1\u2212 3 4m2w20\n( 1\npr\n) . (83)\nFor any given precision and initial width, the right-hand side of the above inequality is smaller than 1, but the\nlimit of n \u2192 \u221e of the right-hand side is 1. This proves that for any given width and precision, there exists an upper bound on n where the systematic error becomes larger than the precision of the experiment. Assuming that the upper bound is large, it can be shown that:\nn < n ub , (84)\nn ub\n= 4\n3 prm\n2w20, (85)\nThe upper bound of n ub is where the relativistic corrections in the rest frame of the particle become important. We assume that mw0 is very large, and the precision is such that 1 n\nub , and we consider only modes of\nn n ub . We, therefore, consistently ignore the relativistic corrections to the Schro\u0308dinger equation in the rest frame of the wave function."

Then, \u3008~x|~n\u3009~w0 satisfies the Schro\u0308dinger equation in (3 + 1)-dimensions:\ni\u2202\u03c4 \u3008~x|~n\u3009~w0 = \u2212 \u22072\n2m \u3008~x|~n\u3009~w0 , (88)\nwhere:\n\u22072 = 3\u2211 i=1 ( \u2202 \u2202xi )2 . (89)\nNotice that ~w0 represent the initial width for x1, x2 and x3 coordinates. For any choices of ~w0, \u3008~x|~n\u3009~w0 provides a complete orthogonal basis for localized solutions of the Schro\u0308dinger equation in (3 + 1)-dimensions. Here, we choose the same initial width of w0 for all the coordinates and set:\nw0 = w01 = w02 = w03. (90)\nFor the sake of simplicity, we also drop subscript ~w0. So the completeness of the basis can be succinctly expressed in Dirac notation: \u2211\n~n\n|~n\u3009\u3008~n| = 1, (91)\n\u3008~n|~m\u3009 = \u03b4~n,~m, (92)\n8 where:\n\u03b4~n,~m = 3\u220f i=1 \u03b4ni,mi . (93)\nWe define the zero state or the ground state by ~0 = (0, 0, 0), and represent it by |0\u3009 = |~0\u3009. We call the state |~n\u3009 as the excitation with number n1, n2 and n3 in respectively the directions of x1, x2 and x3\nAny localized solution to the Schro\u0308dinger equation can be represented by:\n|\u03d5\u0303\u3009 = \u2211 ~n c~n|~n\u3009, (94)\nwhere |~n\u3009 represents the localised Hermite mode of ~n, and c~n are complex constant numbers identified by the initial conditions. Recall that we are working in the rest frame of the wave function, so the expectation of the linear momentum must vanish:\n\u3008\u03d5\u0303|~p | \u03d5\u0303\u3009 = 0. (95)\nWe further can choose the origin of the coordinates by demanding:\n\u3008\u03d5\u0303|~x | \u03d5\u0303\u3009 = 0. (96)\nLet us call ~n and ~m as two immediate neighbours if |n1 \u2212m1| = 1 or |n2 \u2212m2| = 1 or |n3 \u2212m3| = 1. Utilizing 2xHn(x) = Hn+1(x) + 2nHn\u22121(x) or by direct calculation, it can be proven that (95) and (96) hold true when c~n vanishes for at least one of any immediate neighbours."

We consider that the observable moves on a time-like geodesic. The expansion of Fermi coordinates adapted to the time-like geodesic \u03b3, up to the quadratic transverse directions, are given by Manasse and Misner [32]. The expansion up to the fourth order is given in [33]. To reproduce this expansion, we first introduce \u03b5 as a small dummy parameter to systematically track the perturbation. At the end of the perturbative calculation, we set \u03b5 = 1. In the expansion given in [33], we scale the transverse direction by the factor of \u03b5. We present the expansion to the line element up to the third order by:\nds2 = (0)ds2 + (2)ds2\u03b52 + (3)ds2\u03b53 +O(\u03b54), (97)\nNotice that we have used the left upper script of (n) to represent the nth order correction to the line element. And notice that by definition, there is no perturbation at the linear order of \u03b5, because by definition, the first\nderivative of the metric in the Fermi coordinates evaluated along the central geodesic vanishes.

Notice that Manasse and Misner\u2019s work [32] with a non-standard sign convention for the Riemann tensor: (Manasse-Misner)R \u00b5\u03bd \u03c1\u03c3 = (MTW)R\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3, where (MTW)R\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 is the standard sign convention in GR textbook by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler [38] which is the most widely used sign convention nowadays. The standard sign convention is utilised in Eq. (97). Also notice that dx0dxi in line 4 of Eq. (45) in [33] is missing an overall factor of 2 that is included in Eq.

Note that ( 12R0a0bx axb) which appears in Eq. (102) is the residual Newtonian potential and is equal to 1+g002 \u2013 here, g00 is the zero-zero component of the metric presented in Eq. (97). Reference [26] has proven that the wave function can be scaled such that Eq. (103) holds, and the contribution of the rest of the components of the metric can be neglected at the leading order. We write a perturbative expansion for the wave function:\n\u03a8 = \u03a8 (0) + \u03b52\u03a8 (2) +O(\u03b53), (104)\nwhich can be substituted into Eq.

We refer to Eq. (108) as R2 functions. The Einstein equation of motion for the background spacetime geometry in the vacuum implies that the Ricci tensor vanishes. Some components of the Ricci tensor evaluated on the central time-like geodesic are given by:\n0 = R00 = \u03b4 abR0a0b, (109) 0 = R0c = \u03b4 abR0acb, (110)\nwhich implies nRab\u03b4ab = 0 for n \u2208 {1, 2, 3} . Let us expand \u03a8 (2):\n\u03a8 (2) = 1\u03a8 (2) + m\n2i 1Rabxaxb\u03a8 (0), (111)\nwhere 1\u03a8 (2) is a general function of \u03c4 and xa. Substituting Eq. (111) into Eq. (106) yields:(\ni\u22020 + \u22072\n2m\n) 1\u03a8 (2) = i 1Rabxa\u2202b\u03a8 (0). (112)\nNow let 1\u03a8 (2) be expressed by:\n1\u03a8 (2) = 2\u03a8 (2) + 2Rabxa\u2202b\u03a8 (0), (113)\nwhere 2\u03a8 (2)\nis a general function of \u03c4 and xa. Employing Eq. (113) in Eq. (112) yields:(\ni\u22020 + \u22072\n2m\n) 2\u03a8 (2) = \u2212 1\nm 2Rab\u2202a\u2202b\u03a8 (0), (114)\nwhich is solved by:\n2\u03a8 (2) = i\nm 3Rab\u2202a\u2202b\u03a8 (0).

(106) for any \u03a8 (0) that solves (105), and satisfies the boundary condition chosen in (107). It is more convenient to define the following Hermitian operators:\nQ(2) = \u2212m 2 1Rabxaxb + 2Rabxapb \u2212 1 m 3Rabpapb,\n(117)\nwhere pa = \u2212i\u2202a represents the momentum.

(119)\nIt can be easily seen that the norm is left intact by the \u03b5 perturbation:\n\u3008\u03a8 |\u03a8\u3009 = \u3008\u03a8 (0)|\u03a8 (0)\u3009+O(\u03b53), (120)\nwhich is due to the fact that Q(2) is Hermitian: Q(2) = Q(2)\u2020."

We refer to the above quantities as R3 functions. Notice that nRabc is a function of the Riemann tensor evaluated and integrated over the central time-like geodesic, is symmetric under permutation of their indices, and vanishes at \u03c4 = 0.\nEquations (109) and (110) imply that on the central geodesic, we have,\n0 = R00;c = \u03b4 abR0a0b;c, (141) 0 = R0c,0 = \u03b4 abR0acb;0.\nThe second Bianchi identity evaluated on the central time-like geodesic and contracted by \u03b4ab implies:\n\u03b4ab(R0a0c;b +R0acb;c +R0ab0;c) = 0\n\u2192 \u03b4abR0a0c;b = 0, (142)\nwhere in its second line, Eqs.(141) are used.

Thus, we first substitute Eq. (146) in Eq. (127) and rewrite the force at the cubic order\u2019s correction by:\nF (3)a (~n) = 1F (3)a + 2F (3)a + 3F (3)a , (149a)\nwhere\n1F (3)a = \u2212 \u03c4 R w20 \u2202\u03c4 ( 1Rabc \u2329 ~n \u2223\u2223xbxc|~n\u232a) , (149b) 2F (3)a = 1 2 \u2202\u03c4 ( 2Rabc \u2329 ~n \u2223\u2223(xbpc + pcxb)|~n\u232a) , (149c) 3F (3)a = \u2212 w20 2\u03c4 R \u2202\u03c4 ( 3Rabc \u2329 ~n \u2223\u2223pbpc|~n\u232a) , (149d)\n12\nwhere m in (146) is substituted with 2\u03c4 R\nw20 . Employing\nEq. (148) and the exact form of |~n\u3009 yield:\u2329 ~n \u2223\u2223xbxc|~n\u232a = 2nb + 1\n4 w2\u03b4bc, (150)\n1\n2\n\u2329 ~n \u2223\u2223(xbpc + pcxb)|~n\u232a = (2nb + 1)\u03c4\n2\u03c4 R \u03b4bc, (151)\u2329 ~n \u2223\u2223pbpc|~n\u232a = 2nb + 1\nw20 \u03b4bc, (152)\nwhere \u03c4 R is the Rayleigh proper time presented in Eq. (52). The force exerted on |~n\u3009, then, is simplified to:\nF (3)a = Fabcnb\u03b4 bc, (153)\nwhere summation over b and c are understood, and:\nFabc = \u2212 \u03c42 R + \u03c42\n2\u03c4 R\nR0(a0b;c). (154)\nWe observe that only R0(a0b;c) contributes to the residual force at the cubic order\u2019s correction. The integration of R0(a0b;c) over the geodesic that is encoded in the R3 functions do not contribute to the residual force. The residual force at the cubic order\u2019s correction remains local because the force does not depend on the history of the wave function. At the sub-sub-leading order, the square of \u03a8 (2) contributes to the equation of motion for \u03a8 (4). Since \u03a8 (4) depends on the history of the wave function by the R2 functions defined in Eq. (108), we expect that the residual force depends on the history of the wave function at the order of \u03b54. However, performing the calculation at order \u03b54 is beyond the scope of the current work."

We choose the unit of length such that rs = 1.\nLet us now consider geodesics in the Schwarzschild geometry. Due to the spherically symmetry, without loss of generality, we can choose the equatorial plane, i.e.:\n\u03b8 = \u03c0\n2 ,\n\u03b8\u0307 = 0, (156)\nto describe any given geodesic at all times. The cyclic variables of \u03d5 and t lead to invariant quantities:\n\u2202L \u2202\u03d5 = 0 \u2192 r2\u03d5\u0307 = l , (157) \u2202L \u2202t = 0 \u2192 ( 1\u2212 1 r ) t\u0307 = E . (158)\nThe Lagrangian being independent of \u03c4 implies that the Hamiltonian exhibits time invariance. Additionally, since the Lagrangian has a quadratic form, the Hamiltonian can be equated to the Lagrangian. Consequently, we can establish the following:\nL = \u2212 (\n1\u2212 1 r\n) t\u03072 + r\u03072\n1\u2212 1r + r2 \u03d5\u03072 = \u22121 .

(160)\nWe assume that in the far past, the laboratory was located at asymptotic infinity and was moving towards a black hole with a finite non-zero angular momentum per unit mass. Therefore, the laboratory\u2019s time-like geodesic can be described by a finite parameter l while l is not equal to zero. We further assume that the absolute value of the velocity of the lab at the asymptotic infinity is v, and the lab is radially falling into the black hole. Equation (157) then implies that the lab velocity is radial at the asymptotic infinity since r\u03d5\u0307 vanishes at the asymptotic infinity. So it holds that,\nr\u0307|r=\u221e = \u2212\u03b3v, t\u0307|r=\u221e = \u03b3, (161)\nwhere \u03b3 is the boost factor: \u03b3 = 1\u221a 1\u2212v2 . Equation (158), then, implies E = \u03b3 and yields t\u0307 = \u03b3rr\u22121 . Equation (159) results:\nr\u03072 = \u03b32 \u2212 ( 1 + l2\nr2\n)( 1\u2212 1\nr\n) . (162)\nTo calculate the components of the first derivative of the metric in the Fermi coordinates from (160), we use the tensorial property of the covariant derivative of the Riemann tensor. Assuming that the components of the covariant derivative of the Riemann tensor in the general coordinates x\u00b5 is given by R\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u03b7;\u03b3 , the components of the covariant derivative of the Riemann tensor in the coordinates y\u00b5 \u2032 is given by:\nR\u00b5\u2032\u03bd\u2032\u03bb\u2032\u03b7\u2032;\u03b3\u2032 = \u2202x\u00b5 \u2202y\u00b5\u2032 \u2202x\u03bd \u2202y\u03bd\u2032 \u2202x\u03bb \u2202y\u03bb\u2032 \u2202x\u03b7 \u2202y\u03b7\u2032 \u2202x\u03b3 \u2202y\u03b3\u2032 R\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u03b7;\u03b3 , (163)\n13\nwhere R\u00b5\u2032\u03bd\u2032\u03bb\u2032\u03b7\u2032;\u03b3\u2032 represents the components of the covariant derivative of the Riemann tensor in y\u00b5 \u2032\ncoordinates. The components of the covariant derivative of the Riemann tensor in the standard spherical coordinates are given in (160). We utilize [26]) to write the partial derivative of the standard spherical coordinates with respect to the Fermi coordinates:\n\u2202r \u2202x0 = \u2212\u03b3 tanh\u03b1 cos\u03b2, \u2202r \u2202x1 =\u03b3 cos\u03b2, \u2202r \u2202x2 = \u2212\u03b3 sin\u03b2 cosh\u03b1 , \u2202\u03d5\n\u2202x0 = \u2212 sinh\u03b1 sin\u03b2 r , \u2202\u03d5 \u2202x1 = cosh\u03b1 sin\u03b2 r , \u2202\u03d5 \u2202x2 = cos\u03b2 r ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202x0 =\ncosh2 \u03b1\n\u03b3 , \u2202t \u2202x1 = \u2212 sinh 2\u03b1 2\u03b3 , \u2202\u03b8 \u2202x3 = 1 r . (164)\nHere, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are defined by:\ncosh\u03b1 = \u03b3\n\u221a r\nr \u2212 1 , sinh\u03b1 =\n\u221a cosh2 \u03b1\u2212 1,\nsin\u03b2 = l\nr sinh\u03b1 , cos\u03b2 =\n\u221a 1\u2212 sin2 \u03b2. (165)\nTo succinctly express the non-zero components of R0(a0b;c) which appear in the force and in Eq. (140), we first define variable \u03c7 by:\n\u03c7 = sin\u03b2 (r \u2212 1) cosh\u03b1 = l r\n( \u03b32 \u2212 1 + 1\nr\n)\u2212 12 , (166)\nand notice:\nR0(101;1) +R0(202:1) +R0(303;1) = 0,\nR0(101;2) +R0(202:2) +R0(303;2) = 0. (167)\nThe independent non-zero components of R0(b0b;c) then are given by:\nR0(101;1) = 3\u03b3 cos\u03b2\n( 5 cos2\u03b2 \u2212 3 ) 2r4 ,\nR0(303;1) = \u2212 \u03b3 cos\u03b2\n( 5l2 + 3r2 ) 2r6 ,\nR0(303;2) = 3\u03b33\u03c7\n2r3\n( 4\u2212 3(r \u2212 1)\nr\u03b32\n) ,\nR0(202;2) = 3\u03b33\u03c7\n2r3\n( 5 cos2\u03b2 \u2212 3 + r \u2212 1\nr\u03b32\n) . (168)\nWe have directly calculated and checked that all components of R0(a0b;c) remain finite on and outside the event horizon. Note that R0(a0b;3) = 0; therefore, no residual force exists in the direction of x3. So at this level, the plane of the trajectory of the localised quantum wave remains intact."

            "text": "In order to consistently describe the physics of a localised wave function/wavepacket in the presence of a Schwarzschild black hole, we consider that:\n1. In the rest frame of the black hole, the energy associated to the wave function is much smaller than the mass of black hole.\n2. The width of the wavepacket is always smaller than the curvature of the spacetime geometry.\n3. The central geodesic of the rest frame of the wave function is described by a time-like geodesic with parameters of l and \u03b3 where l is defined in eq. (157) and \u03b3 is the boost factor with respect to the black hole at the asymptotic infinity.\n4. The initial width of the wavepacket at distance a from the black hole is given by w0.\nIn this section, we assume that the central geodesic of the wavepacket is radially falling and is associated to \u03b3 = 1 in (161). The central radial geodesic, therefore, is characterised by:\nl = \u03b2 = 0,\n\u03b3 = 1. (169)\nThe Fermi coordinates then coincide to x\u03021 = r\u0302, x\u03022 = \u03d5\u0302 and x\u03023 = \u03b8\u0302 [26]. Equation (162) can be solved to find the proper time that the wavepacket needs to reach the Schwarzschild radius/event horizon:\n\u03c4s = 2\n3 (a\n3 2 \u2212 1). (170)\n14\nWe assume that a is much larger than 1, so the width of the wavepacket at the event horizon can be approximate by:ws = 4a3/2\n3mw0 \u2212 43mw0 +O(a \u22123/2). The consistency of our approach requires that the width of the wave packet remains smaller than the curvature of the spacetime geometry. We utilize the Kretschmann invariant to estimate the curvature of the spacetime geometry: R\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2R\n\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 = 12r6 . We require the width of the wavepacket on the event horizon to be much smaller than the square root of the inverse of the Kretschmann invariant:(\na\nrs\n) 3 2\n\u221a\n3\n8 w0 \u03bbc , (171)\nNotice that symbol \u03bbc represents the Compton wavelength associated with a particle of mass m. It is defined as \u03bbc = ~c m , where ~ is the reduced Planck constant and c is the speed of light. In addition, the Schwarzschild radius rs is explicitly shown too. If we apply (171) to the wave packets of the protons in the boundary of the Milky Way, we see that only the ones with an initial width larger than 20 meters may fall into Sagittarius A\u2217. We assume that (171) is satisfied. Furthermore, for sake of simplicity we consider the initial standard Hermite mode |~n\u3009 with an initial width of w0:\n|\u03a8\u3009 \u2223\u2223 \u03c4=0 = |~n\u3009 . (172)\nWe utilise (118) to represent the wave function at \u03c4 > 0:\n|\u03a8\u3009 = exp(iQ) |~n\u3009 , (173)\nwhere Q encodes the evolution of the wave function due to its interaction with the Riemann tensor, the \u03b5 expansion series for Q is provided in Eq. (119). Fig. 3 depicts the wavepacket at r = a, and a later time at a general r. We are interested in calculating the residual force, which is presented in Eqs. (153) and (154). The non-zero components of R0(a0b;c) provided in Eq. (168) for Eq. (169) are simplified to:\nR0(101;1) = \u22122R0(202;1) = \u22122R0(303;1) = 3\nr4 , (174)\nwhich implies that non-zero coefficients of Fabc introduced in Eq. (154) hold:\nF221 = F331 = \u2212 1\n2 F111. (175)\nThis means that the residual force exists only in the direction of x1 that coincides with the r\u2019s direction. Utilizing (153), one can calculate the force exerted on the state |~n\u3009:\nF (3) 1 = F111 ( n1 \u2212\nn2 + n3 2\n) , (176)\nwhere\nF111 = \u2212 3(\u03c42 R + \u03c42)\n2\u03c4 R r4\n. (177)\n\u03c4 is a function of r, as is explicitly expressed in Eq. (170). The divergence at r = 0 is due to the singularity of the Schwarzschild metric at r = 0. It can also be shown that when the width of the wave function outside the event horizon remains much smaller than the Schwarzschild radius, the impulse of the residual force does not generate an escape velocity for the in-falling wave functions, and the radially in-falling wave function falls into the event horizon."

Notice that v is the velocity of the rest frame (at the asymptotic infinity) with respect to the black hole. Therefore, v can be arbitrary large. One may wish to consider the large \u03b3 limit of (189) in order to possibly gain some insights on the deflection of a spatially structured photon by a black hole:\nlim \u03b3\u2192\u221e\n\u2206\u03d5 = \u2212qw 2 0\na3 .

The precision of the Eo\u0308tvo\u0308s experiment near Earth is also not sensitive to the predicted displacement due to different internal quantum structures [39]."

            "text": "Propagation of a localised wave function of a massive particle been studied in the flat and curved spacetime geometry. The notion of a rest frame is extended for a localised wave function in section 2. The low energy modes in the rest frame of the wave function have been studied, and complete orthogonal basis of the standard Hermite-Gaussian modes has been adapted in section 3. We have utilised the Fermi coordinates adapted to the time-like geodesic of the rest frame and have calculated the leading and sub-leading general relativistic corrections to a general, localised wave function in section 4. It has been shown that as a localised wave function freely propagates in a curved spacetime geometry, it interacts with the curvature of the spacetime geometry around the geodesic. This interaction leads to the distortion operator Q defined in (118). The quadratic and cubic order corrections to the distortion operator have been calculated in (117) and (145). It has been shown that the distortion operator is a function of the Riemann tensor, and its covariant derivative is evaluated and integrated over the time-like geodesic of the rest frame.\nSection 4.1.2 has employed Newton\u2019s Lex Secunda in order to define the residual net force acting on the wave function \u03a8 as the time rate of the change of its average linear momentum. It has been shown that the residual net force vanishes at the level of quadratic corrections. However, it does not vanish at the order of the cubic corrections for a general wave function, as shown in 4.2. It has been proved that spherical symmetric wave functions follow the time-like geodesic of the rest frame. However, non-spherically symmetric wave functions have been shown to experience a net residual force and deviate from the time-like geodesic of the rest frame.\nThe example of the Schwarzschild spacetime geometry has been studied in section 5. The residual force has been computed for radial fall into the black hole 5.1 and a slight deflection from the black hole 5.2. It has been shown that the residual force does not generate an escape velocity for the in-falling particle. However, the residual force for the scattered wave functions leads to a mode-dependent deflection angle where the dependency is in (189), as depicted in Fig. 4. Let us highlight that the dependency to the mode numbers resembles angular deviations in optics where different localised modes [40] are observed to move along different paths in the non-homogeneous medium. Here, we are reporting the\n16\ndisplacement of a localised massive scalar from its expected time-like geodesic. The computed dependency of the deflection in the Solar system turns to be very small to be measured by available technologies. Nonetheless, the finding that trajectories of localised wave functions deviate from geodesics can be counted as evidence supporting the idea that gravity should not be treated as a geometrical force in the quantum realm."
