    "abstractText": "This paper presents the integration of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with soft sensors for enhancing the composition control performance in a distillation column. Static and dynamic soft sensors are developed to estimate the top and bottom product compositions using multiple tray temperatures. In order to cope with the collinearity issues in tray temperature measurements, static and dynamic principal component regression is used in developing the soft sensors. The soft sensor outputs are introduced as the feedback signals to ADRC. This control scheme is termed as \u201cinferential ADRC control\u201d. Static control offsets are eliminated through mean updating in the soft-sensor models. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated on a benchmark simulated methanol-water distillation column.",

            "text": "In the last decades, the proficient and efficient use of energy has become a highly significant issue in the industrial sector since the prices of energy as well as environmental awareness are continuously increasing. Thus, industry is highly interested in approaches for minimizing the energy consumption in industrial processes [1]. Distillation is still one of the most commonly used and one of the most versatile separation methods for separating liquid mixtures in petrochemical and chemical industries accounting for about 25\u201340% of the energy usage in the sector. Due to its relatively low energy efficiency, this unit process is often one of the biggest energy consumers in industrial processes. When considering energy efficiency in any type of distillation columns, it is really necessary to account for the form of energy being consumed and the quality of cooling and heating required. Trade-offs exist between environmental impact, cost, energy sources and equipment requirements. Distillation columns consume a huge amount of energy for providing heat required to convert liquid to vapor and then condense the vapor back to liquid via the condenser. Distillation uses more than 40% of the amount of energy utilized in the refining and bulk chemical process industry and more than 90\u201395% of energy consumed in liquid separation and purification, and accounts for more than 3% of the energy consumption in the world [2]. Moreover, the capital investment of these distillation systems is indicated to be at least eight billion US dollars which can contribute to greater than 50% of both capital and plant operating costs in a typical chemical plant which can have a significant impact on the overall plant profitability [3]. The minimum energy expected to be consumed in distillation columns depends on various operation variables such as temperature spans and operating pressures and the optimization of these variables leads to reducing the energy demand while meeting product quality and quantity requirement [4]. It is very likely that distillation will continue to be the choice of liquid mixture separation for the next decade as it is still labelled \u201cas the technique of choice for many current purification and separation operations\u201d but it needs to make radical modifications and changes to reduce energy consumption.\nSensors 2023, 23, 1019. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23021019 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 1019 2 of 17\nWith the rising environmental concerns and growing energy awareness there is a need to minimize the energy use in all industry sectors [4]. Advanced control of distillation columns is one way of improving their energy efficiency. The control of distillation column must drive the product compositions as close to their desired set-points as possible in the faces of unexpected disturbances in feed flow rate and feed composition. However, it is quite difficult to get reliable and accurate product compositions economically on-line and without time delay. The time delay in most composition analyzers is typically between 10\u201320 min. Such large time delays cause poor control performance and degraded process operation because the effects of disturbances remain undetected for substantial periods of time. The most common alternative technique to product composition control using composition analyzers is indirect composition control through tray temperature control. However, single tray temperatures are not very accurate indicators of product compositions especially under disturbances. Therefore, one approach to overcome this issue is to implement inferential control with multiple tray temperatures in conjunction with advanced control scheme, such as the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) scheme, to improve the overall control performance. Inferential control using soft sensors is capable of alleviating the issue of large measurement delays by using secondary outputs (tray temperatures) to infer the state of primary outputs (product compositions). This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of ADRC and inferential control. A binary methanol\u2013water separation column is presented in Section 3. Section 4 presents an inferential ADRC control strategy for binary distillation columns. Both static and dynamic soft sensors implementation for product composition using principal component regression (PCR) is presented in Section 5. Section 6 presents the control performance of inferential ADRC. The last section presents some concluding remarks."

            "text": "Many industrial plants in the real world are not just time varying and nonlinear but also highly uncertain. The design of control systems for such plants has been the focus of much of the current improvements and developments under the umbrella of adaptive, robust and nonlinear control. However, most of the proposed control methods are based on the assumption that a fairly accurate mathematical model of the plant is available and due to their dependence and complexity on advanced analytical methodologies and mathematical model, these methods have certain limitations in engineering applications. According to the well-known control theorist Roger Brockett that if there is no uncertainty in the system, then feedback control is largely unnecessary [5]. Recognizing the vulnerability and sensibility of the reliance on accurate mathematical models of many modern control algorithms, there has been a gradual avowal over the years that active disturbance estimation is a practical alternative to accurate plant models. Moreover, if a disturbance exists in the plant and is represented by the discrepancy between the industrial plant and its model, then this disturbance can be estimated in real time. Then, the plant-model mismatch can be successfully and efficiently compensated for, making the model-based design tolerant of a considerable number of uncertainties. The main focal point in the close control of such plants is how unknown dynamics and external disturbance can be predicted or estimated. ADRC was introduced in 1995 by Prof. Jinqing Han at the Chinese Academy of Science [6\u20139]. However, most of the earlier papers are in Chinese and the concept of ADRC was first introduced into English literature in 2001 by Gao [10\u201312]. The methodology of ADRC has been in development for over two decades and has been utilized in various engineering applications. It has been considered as an alternative paradigm in control engineering to address and investigate non-linear and time variant systems [12]. ADRC is considered as an advanced form of principle of active control (PAC) and inherits its concept from the limitations of proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) which are error computation, oversimplification of control law as the form of linear weighted sum (LWS), noise degra-\nSensors 2023, 23, 1019 3 of 17\ndation associated with the derivative term and complications associated to the integral control term.

            "text": "The increasing availability of a wide range of sensors and data acquisition systems has led to a corresponding rise in the amount of data that can be logged through the computer control and monitoring systems of industrial processes. Hardware sensors give information on the process operation in terms of process variables, such as pressures, temperatures and flow rates, and product quality variables, such as composition and polymer molecular weight. Such sensors for product quality variables can be utilized to provide information on the quality of the final product in order to certify that it satisfies the customer requirements. However, many product quality variables cannot be easily and economically measured. Such sensors like composition analyzers usually possess large measurement delay and they are usually expensive. In many cases, the main product quality indicators are generally obtained by off-line sample analysis in a scientific laboratory. On-line quality analyzers such as gas chromatography and Near-InfraRed (NIR) are typically expensive and usually incur high maintenance cost [13,14]. Furthermore, significant delays and discontinuity associated with slowly processed quality measurements and laboratory analysis of online analyzers may reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of control policies. Instead of product composition control using composition analyzer and NIR, tray temperature control is broadly used to indirectly control product compositions. Moreover, tray temperature measurements are economic, reliable and virtually without any measurement time delays. However, utilizing single tray temperature to characterize the product composition has some drawbacks such as column pressure variation and feed rate or composition variation can significantly affect the correlation between tray temperatures and product compositions. In industrial processing plants, such restriction and limitations can have a severe impact on product quality. In an effort to overcome the problems encountered in product composition measurement, soft sensing or inferential estimation techniques have acquired momentum recently as viable alternatives to hardware sensors in on-line process monitoring and control [15]. In the last two decades, there has been rising interest and research in the development of soft sensors to provide regular on-line predictions of quality variables based on easy-to-measure process variables. Such soft sensors provide real time estimates of product quality variables and help to improve closed loop control performance and develop tight control policies [16]. A soft sensor can be considered as a mathematical model that generates reliable real time estimates of unmeasured variables from easy-to-measure process variables [16]. There are various advantages of soft sensors in the monitoring and control of industrial processes:\n\u2022 They provide more insight into the process through catching the information hidden in data;\nSensors 2023, 23, 1019 5 of 17\n\u2022 They provide enhanced monitoring and control of industrial processes with the consequences of reducing environmental impact, enhancing productivity and energy efficiency, and improving business profitability through decreasing the production cost related to off-specification products; \u2022 They can be simply implemented on existing hardware. Moreover, on-line model identification algorithms can be utilized to adapt the model when plant characteristics change; and \u2022 They entail little or no capital costs such as installation cost, commissioning and management of the required infrastructure.\nThe design of soft sensors can be either by utilizing grey or black box identification approaches or on the basis of an analytical model. In the development of data-driven empirical model, least squares regression has been widely used. Nevertheless, when numerous input variables are used, this technique can become ineffective due to the strongly correlated nature of process variables. For instance, distillation column tray temperatures are closely correlated to each other and change together in the same pattern. Using linear regression techniques on such highly correlated process data leads to numerical errors due to close to singularity in the data covariance matrix. The common approach for tackling correlation problems is to select a few appropriate variables which are less correlated from each other [17\u201319]. However, this simple technique is not optimal because the information in the discarded measurements might enhance the model performance. Brosilow and co-workers [17,18] introduced a composition estimator called the Brosilow Estimator in which flow rates and temperatures were used for predicting unmeasured disturbance and then the estimated disturbances were utilized to predict product compositions. However, in recent years, product composition estimators have been designed using partial least squares regression (PLS) [20,21]. Mejdell and Skogested [22] compared three linear model-based composition estimators of a binary distillation column. They briefed that good control performance might be reached with the steady state PCR (principal component regression) estimator. They found that the performance of the steady state PCR estimator is nearly good as the dynamic Kalman filter. Zhang [23,24] developed an inferential feedback control strategy for binary distillation composition control using PCR and PLS models. In these works, both top and bottom compositions are estimated via multiple tray temperature measurements and the estimated top and bottom product compositions are then used as feedback control signals."

In this paper, dynamic PCR models with orders ranging from one to seven were developed. The first order dynamic PCR models can be represented in the form below:\ny(t) = \u03b81,1T1(t) + \u03b81,2T1(t\u2212 1) + \u03b82,1T2(t) + \u03b82,2T2(t\u2212 1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03b810,1T10(t) + \u03b810,2T10(t\u2212 1) (8)\nData partition and data scaling are the same as in developing static PCR models presented earlier. The suitable numbers of principal components were once again specified by the least SSE on the testing data. Table 3 presents the number of principal components and the corresponding SSE values on the testing data of these dynamic PCR models.\nSensors 2023, 23, 1019 10 of 17\nTable 3.

Hence, the fifth order dynamic PCR model is used and integrated with the ADRC scheme to estimate the top and bottom product compositions.

Hence, temperatures of the 2nd and the 8th trays were controlled to indirectly control the bottom and top product compositions respectively. Temperatures at the 2nd and the 8th trays corresponding to the top composition of 93% and the bottom composition of 7% are 85.9 \u00b0C and 70.5 \u00b0C, respectively. Hence, the setpoints for the 2nd and the 8th tray temperatures were set at 85.9 \u00b0C and 70.5 \u00b0C, respectively. Temperature setpoints corresponding to other product compositions were identified from simulated process operation data.
