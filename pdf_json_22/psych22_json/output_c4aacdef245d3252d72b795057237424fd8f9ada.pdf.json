    "abstractText": "Background: The psychological impact of COVID-19 can be substantial. However, knowledge about long-term psychological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is scarce. Objective: In this longitudinal, observational study, we aimed to reveal symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms of anxiety and depression up to 6 months after the onset of COVID-19\u2013related symptoms in patients with confirmed COVID-19 and persistent complaints. To demonstrate the impact in nonhospitalized patients, we further aimed to compare these outcomes between nonhospitalized and hospitalized patients. Methods: Demographics, symptoms of PTSD (Trauma Screening Questionnaire [TSQ] \u22656 points) and symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] \u22658 points) were assessed at 3 and 6 months after the onset of COVID-19\u2013related symptoms in members of online long COVID-19 peer support groups. Results: Data from 239 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (198/239, 82.8% female; median age: 50 [IQR 39-56] years) were analyzed. At the 3-month follow-up, 37.2% (89/239) of the patients had symptoms of PTSD, 35.6% (85/239) had symptoms of anxiety, and 46.9% (112/239) had symptoms of depression, which remained high at the 6-month follow-up (64/239, 26.8%, P=.001; 83/239, 34.7%, P=.90; 97/239, 40.6%, P=.08, respectively; versus the 3-month follow-up). TSQ scores and HADS anxiety and depression scores were strongly correlated at the 3and 6-month follow-ups (r=0.63-0.71, P<.001). Symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were comparable between hospitalized (n=62) and nonhospitalized (n=177) patients. Conclusions: A substantial percentage of patients with confirmed COVID-19 and persistent complaints reported symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, or depression 3 and 6 months after the onset of COVID-19\u2013related symptoms. The prevalence rates of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were comparable between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and merely improved over time. Health care professionals need to be aware of these psychological complications and intervene on time in post-COVID-19 patients with persistent complaints.

However, knowledge about long-term psychological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is scarce.\nObjective: In this longitudinal, observational study, we aimed to reveal symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms of anxiety and depression up to 6 months after the onset of COVID-19\u2013related symptoms in patients with confirmed COVID-19 and persistent complaints. To demonstrate the impact in nonhospitalized patients, we further aimed to compare these outcomes between nonhospitalized and hospitalized patients.\nMethods: Demographics, symptoms of PTSD (Trauma Screening Questionnaire [TSQ] \u22656 points) and symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] \u22658 points) were assessed at 3 and 6 months after the onset of COVID-19\u2013related symptoms in members of online long COVID-19 peer support groups.\nResults: Data from 239 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (198/239, 82.8% female; median age: 50 [IQR 39-56] years) were analyzed. At the 3-month follow-up, 37.2% (89/239) of the patients had symptoms of PTSD, 35.6% (85/239) had symptoms of anxiety, and 46.9% (112/239) had symptoms of depression, which remained high at the 6-month follow-up (64/239, 26.8%, P=.001; 83/239, 34.7%, P=.90; 97/239, 40.6%, P=.08, respectively; versus the 3-month follow-up). TSQ scores and HADS anxiety and depression scores were strongly correlated at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (r=0.63-0.71, P<.001). Symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were comparable between hospitalized (n=62) and nonhospitalized (n=177) patients.\nConclusions: A substantial percentage of patients with confirmed COVID-19 and persistent complaints reported symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, or depression 3 and 6 months after the onset of COVID-19\u2013related symptoms. The prevalence rates of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were comparable between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and merely improved over time.

            "text": "A traumatic event is an incident that causes physical, emotional, spiritual, or psychological harm [1]. The impact of a traumatic event varies between individuals. Most individuals are resilient, develop appropriate coping strategies, and recover without long-term consequences. Nevertheless, some experience symptoms such as unwanted upsetting memories, flashbacks, nightmares, emotional distress, or physical reactivity after exposure to traumatic reminders. If symptoms last for more than 1 month, create distress, or interfere with daily functioning, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) needs to be considered [2]. PTSD has major negative consequences for patients and their families [2,3] and is associated with long-term comorbid depression and substance abuse [2], underlining the need to detect and treat the disorder.\nSevere illness or acute onset of severe illness can be experienced as a traumatic event [1]. Furthermore, isolation precautions for infection prevention have been shown to be associated with severe mental health problems [4]. Accordingly, COVID-19 might also lead to PTSD. Indeed, previous studies reported prevalences of symptoms of PTSD ranging from 10% to 30% in patients discharged from the hospital [5-12]. Prevalences of symptoms of anxiety and depression in these samples vary between 5% and 42% [7,9-12] and 14% and 31% [6,9,11,12], respectively. A recently published review also confirmed the persistence of symptoms and their physical and psychosocial impact following a COVID-19 infection [13]. However, the authors mainly summarized findings from studies including hospitalized patients and concluded that more research is needed in nonhospitalized patients [13]. Indeed, the impact of so-called \u201cmild\u201d COVID-19 can be substantial [14-16]. To date, knowledge about psychological long-term outcomes in these patients is scarce. Mazza and colleagues [11] studied PTSD, depression, and anxiety in COVID-19 patients who visited the emergency department (ED) and compared outcomes between patients who were hospitalized or managed at home 1 month after discharge or ED visit. Psychological outcomes, including PTSD, major depression, and anxiety, were comparable between both groups or even worse in nonhospitalized patients [11]. So, even \u201cmild\u201d COVID-19 may not only cause symptoms of anxiety and depression but also be a stressor leading to PTSD symptoms.\nAs symptoms of PTSD often develop after a period of time or get worse over time [17], longer follow-up is needed. Therefore, we aimed to explore the prevalence of PTSD and symptoms of anxiety and depression at 3 and 6 months after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and to study the association between symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression in patients with confirmed COVID-19. To demonstrate the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, especially in nonhospitalized patients, we aimed to compare these outcomes between nonhospitalized and hospitalized patients. As the number of reports demonstrating\na substantial burden of psychological trauma in patients with less severe COVID-19 is increasing [18], we hypothesized in advance that the long-term impact of COVID-19 on mental health, even in nonhospitalized patients, is substantial."

            "text": "This study supports the suggestion by Gu and colleagues [30] that the impact of COVID-19 is no less than the impact of other stressors (eg, natural disasters, technological accidents). The prevalence of patients at risk of PTSD (89/239, 37.2%) is nearly comparable with the prevalence (41%) found in 76 victims of violence and traffic accidents [31]. In addition, a meta-analysis suggested that around 20% of adult critical care survivors experience PTSD [32], while in previous coronavirus pandemics (SARS and MERS outbreaks), PTSD occurred in 32.2% of individuals who recovered from coronavirus infection [33]. This demonstrates the long-term impact of severe viral disease. Whether PTSD is also highly prevalent in the aftermath of different COVID-19 populations remains to be determined. Previous published studies reported prevalences of symptoms of PTSD ranging from 10% to 30% in patients discharged from the hospital [5-12], which is lower than the current prevalence rates from hospitalized as well as nonhospitalized patients. Hellemons and colleagues [12] reported an even lower prevalence for PTSD (4%) in patients with COVID-19 6 months after hospital discharge. With regards to anxiety and depression, a meta-analysis demonstrated pooled prevalences of 47% and 45% for anxiety and depression, respectively, in patients with COVID-19 [34]. In addition, Kong and colleagues [35] used the same assessment method (HADS) and the same cut-off score (\u22658 points) as our study to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and showed prevalences of 35% and 29%, respectively. This study reported a comparable prevalence of anxiety symptoms, though a higher prevalence of depression symptoms, which might be explained by the fact that our study included patients with long COVID-19 symptoms. This study showed that symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression merely improved over time. This is in line with a recent study demonstrating that anxiety and PTSD did not change between 1- and 3-month follow-ups in COVID-19 survivors after hospital discharge [10]. Our paper supports the authors\u2019 conclusion that patient follow-up is an essential component of disease management [10], especially in patients with persistent complaints."

However, they probably learned to cope with the persistent symptoms of the disease during hospital admission or received aftercare immediately after discharge. Indeed, compared with nonhospitalized patients, hospitalized patients more often received any care from a physiotherapist, medical specialist (eg, pulmonologist), psychologist, dietician, or nurse during or after the onset of symptoms [15]. Moreover, not only during the infection but also in the months following the onset of symptoms, hospitalized patients received physiotherapy or\nrehabilitation substantially more often than nonhospitalized patients [23]. This might have contributed to the higher percentage of hospitalized patients reporting good self-reported health during the follow-up compared with nonhospitalized patients."

They indicated the need for certainty and wanted clear information [24], which might further contribute to anxious or depressive feelings or add to \u201cirritability\u201d and \u201cfeeling jumpy or being startled at something unexpected.\u201d Indeed, in uncertain or frightening situations, clear and precise information is essential [36]. Furthermore, lacking knowledge of the pandemic and less family support were associated with increased risk of depression or anxiety [37].\nIn addition, patients indicated the need for a test to confirm their diagnosis or certainty that they have had COVID-19: \u201cWithout a test, it\u2019s all in your mind, it\u2019s a psychological thing\u201d [24]. This study demonstrated once again the (mental) impact on patients with suspected COVID-19. We therefore underline the importance of also considering these patients for relevant interventions.\nSocial Isolation The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is tremendous, not only in patients who have been infected with the disease: \u201cHumans are social beings; hence, it is not surprising that extended periods of social isolation are so difficult to cope with\u201d [38]. Being in lockdown can lead to feelings of confinement and loneliness [39]. Loneliness has been described as one of the greatest threats to our health, survival, and well-being [36]. Furthermore, besides the physical harm of COVID-19, periods of confinement can be associated with depression, anxiety, and PTSD [38]. Quarantine has been associated with increased rates of suicide, anger, acute stress disorder, depression, and PTSD, with symptoms continuing even years after quarantine ends [38]."

In the following paragraphs, several strengths and limitations are discussed.\nFirst, the majority of the study sample was middle-aged women, which may limit the external validity of the study. However, this needs to be discussed in a broader context: During the COVID-19 pandemic, female gender has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of anxiety or depression as well as PTSD [37], and women and younger age groups were at risk of poorer mental health [40,41]. Additionally, older age was associated with better mental health (ie, lower levels of anxiety and depression). However, the role of age during the\nJMIR Ment Health 2022 | vol. 9 | iss. 2 | e33704 | p. 8https://mental.jmir.org/2022/2/e33704 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nrecovery period is not known yet [42]. Nonetheless, the gender distribution is consistent with previous studies [43-47] and can partly be explained by the higher number of women in COVID-19 support groups [44,45]. Moreover, it has been suggested that long COVID is more common in women than in men [47]. Second, a comprehensive picture of the mental health status of the study sample before infection is not known. We do know that patients with psychiatric history were more likely to have PTSD as demonstrated by Kang and colleagues [48]. However, of those 239 confirmed cases included in our study, 2 (0.8%) patients reported that they had been treated for anxiety, while 5 (2.1%) patients reported that they had been treated for depressive mood before infection (see Multimedia Appendix 6), suggesting a limited influence of pre-existing mental health problems in this study. Third, a longer follow-up period might be relevant to detect even more patients with PTSD symptoms, as there can be a delay of months or even years before symptoms appear for some people [49]. Fourth, there is lack of data about other COVID-19\u2013related stressors (such as death or serious illness [due to COVID-19] of a loved one, social isolation, or loss of work), which might have influenced mental health status. Finally, since the study sample consisted of selected participants recruited through online platforms and specifically targeted patients with persistent complaints, the external validity of our findings is limited.\nTaking these considerations into account, this study sample still represents an important, as well as increasing, group of patients with a rising demand for health care services [18]."

Health care professionals need to be aware that patients, especially women and younger age groups [40,41], are at risk of developing such symptoms and need to intervene on time (eg, prevention of onset of these symptoms during the acute phase or treatment and prevention of progression during follow-up). General practitioners and occupational physicians play a central role in the management of mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, involving early detection, (risk) assessment, and referral [51-53]. Accordingly, psychological-behavioral interventions might be provided if needed, which has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19 [35]. Internet-based cognitive and behavioral therapy has been shown to be an effective and acceptable alternative to therapist-delivered treatments for anxiety and depression, while the efficacy for treating PTSD is uncertain [54]. Systemic and well-designed intervention trials with robust outcome evaluations are needed to reveal strategies and models of prevention for PTSD among individuals affected by epidemics of other infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 [50]. Additionally, creating opportunities for patients to access platforms and care team members through telehealth is recommended [55]. Finally, as the experienced distress is a normal human response to a serious crisis, it is therefore advised to recognize and accept these feelings to prevent them from turning into a disorder [36]."
