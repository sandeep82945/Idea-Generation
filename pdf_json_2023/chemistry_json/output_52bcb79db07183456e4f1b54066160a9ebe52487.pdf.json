Use of cold- and salt-tolerant enzymes allows to limit costs, reduce contaminations, and minimize pretreatment steps. Here, we\u00a0report on the screening of 186 morphologically diverse microorganisms isolated from marine biofilms and water samples collected in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) for the identification of new laccase activities. After primary screening, 13.4 and 10.8% of the isolates were identified for the ability to oxidize 2,2\u2032-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and the dye azure B, respectively. Amongst them, the marine Halomonas sp. strain M68 showed the highest activity. Production of its laccase-like activity increased six-fold when copper was added to culture medium. Enzymatic activity-guided separation coupled with mass spectrometry identified this intracellular laccase-like protein (named Ant laccase) as belonging to the copper resistance system multicopper oxidase family. Ant laccase oxidized ABTS and 2,6-dimethoxy phenol, working better at acidic pHs The enzyme showed a good thermostability, with optimal temperature in the 40\u2013 50\u00b0C range and maintaining more than 40% of its maximal activity even at 10\u00b0C. Furthermore, Ant laccase was salt- and organic solvent-tolerant, paving the way for its use in harsh conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report concerning the characterization of a thermo- and halo-tolerant laccase isolated from a marine Antarctic bacterium.\nKEYWORDS\nAntarctica, laccase, Halomonas sp., marine biofilm, cold-adaptation, extremophile bacteria\n1.

Salt-tolerant enzymes, produced by moderate and extreme halophiles (growing, respectively, at 3\u201315% or 15\u201330% w/v NaCl concentration) often maintain their activity at high ionic strength, in the presence of organic solvents and detergents, so that their use might reduce the need for pre-treatments and washing steps (De Lourdes Moreno et\u00a0al., 2013; Yin et\u00a0al., 2015).\nAntarctica is known as the coldest, driest, windiest, and most inaccessible continent on Earth (Duarte et\u00a0al., 2017). The survival and growth of organisms in this region is severely restricted by the high seasonable variability, with extremely low temperatures and light exposure in winter, and by the scarce availability of water and the associated osmotic stress. In spite of these conditions, microorganisms (mainly prokaryotes, but also fungi, microalgae, and protists) are able to colonize all Antarctic habitats, including lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, glaciers, rocks, and soils (Taton et\u00a0al., 2003; Biondi et\u00a0al., 2008; Brunati et\u00a0 al., 2009; Rojas et\u00a0 al., 2009; Zucconi et\u00a0 al., 2020). Thus, it is not surprising that in the last two decades, the number of studies exploring Antarctica microbial biodiversity as an untapped source of extremozymes has steadily grown (N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Montero and Barrientos, 2018). Most of these studies focus on the microbiota of Antarctic soils or lakes (Obbels et\u00a0al., 2016; Tytgat et\u00a0al., 2016; Pessi et\u00a0al., 2018). Indeed, little is still known about the psychrophilic and halophilic microbial communities living in the Antarctic Ocean, despite its wide extension and its biological species richness, fully comparable to that of temperate oceans (Marx et\u00a0al., 2007). During the Italian National Antarctic Research Program ANT-biofilm (PNRA16_00105) project, marine microbial biofilms and seawater samples were collected from the Terra Nova Bay littoral (Ross Sea, Victoria Land), where the Italian research station Mario Zucchelli is located (Figure\u00a01). From these samples, a total of 186 morphologically\ndiverse microorganisms were isolated, by combining different isolation methods and using more than a dozen of cultivation media incubated at different temperatures. This yielded an Antarctic marine microbial strain collection, which could represent a promising source for novel extremozymes identification. In this paper we\u00a0report on the screening of this collection to discover novel extremophilic laccases (EC 1.10.3.2, benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase).\nLaccases are copper containing oxidases, mainly produced by fungi, bacteria, plants, and insects (Kumar and Chandra, 2020; Malhotra and Suman, 2021). They are able to catalyze oxidative coupling or bond cleavage of target compounds through four single-electron oxidation and radical formation, using oxygen as the final electron acceptor and reducing it to water. These enzymes show a wide substrate range, which is further broadened by the use of synthetic or natural redox mediators, such as 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) or syringaldehyde (Pollegioni et\u00a0al., 2015; Chauhan et al., 2017; Yang et\u00a0al., 2017). Furthermore, the 2,2\u2032,6,6\u2032-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO)/laccase catalytic system has been proved to be\u00a0an efficient chemo-enzymatic system for the oxidation of various classes of organic compounds under aerobic conditions, including benzyl alcohols and diols, both in sequential multi-step and cascade processes (Fabbrini et\u00a0 al., 2001; D\u00edaz-Rodr\u00edguez et\u00a0 al., 2012; Brenna et\u00a0 al., 2017, 2018). Laccases are enzymes with powerful applications in a wide variety of industrial processes, such as (i) bleaching in the textile and dye industry, (ii) baking, juice processing and wine and beer stabilization in the food industry, and (iii) paper and fiberboards manufacturing in forestproduct industry, where lignin removal or polymerization is required (Canas and Camarero, 2010; Pollegioni et\u00a0al., 2015; Tonin et\u00a0al., 2016; Mayolo-Deloisa et\u00a0al., 2020). Laccases contribute to lignin utilization, being considered promising in converting plant biomass in integrated lignocellulose biorefineries for biofuel production (Roth and Spiess, 2015; Liu et\u00a0al., 2020). Additionally, they can be\u00a0applied in wastewater treatment and bioremediation for their ability to effectively degrade and detoxify various persistent organic pollutants, including dyestuffs,\nFIGURE\u00a01 Map of the sampling sites in Terra Nova Bay (Antarctica).

Within Road Bay area, the station Road Bay was affected by the wastewaters of the Zucchelli Station, while Punta Stocchino was a clean control site without anthropic impact. Within the Tethys Bay area, the station Amorphous Glacier was a site exposed to salinity gradient due to climate warming, while Tethys Bay station represented the control site, not exposed to natural perturbation.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, antibiotics, and other pharmaceuticals. They also find application in organic synthesis for the enzymatic conversion of chemical intermediates and in the production of pigments and antioxidants (Mayer and Staples, 2002; Mustafa et\u00a0al., 2005; Alcalde, 2007; Yang et\u00a0al., 2017). Laccases capable of tolerating extreme temperatures and pHs, salinity, and the presence of metals and chemical reagents are therefore required for such applications (Tonin et\u00a0al., 2016; Duarte et\u00a0al., 2017).\nApart from a previous report (Duarte et\u00a0al., 2017), to our knowledge, the present study is one of the first contributes regarding the bioprospecting of the Antarctic microbial diversity for the screening and discovery of such novel promising extremophilic laccases."

Microbial biofilms growing on the panels and samples of surrounding seawater were collected three and 12 months after immersion (Caruso, 2020). Contextually to the sampling, the main physical\u2013chemical parameters of the water (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and fluorescence) were recorded at each station using a SeaBird 9/11 plus multiparametric probe (Caroppo et\u00a0al., 2022). At the Zucchelli laboratory1, microbial biofilms were scraped using a sterile scalpel taking care to avoid contamination. They were in part serially diluted in sterile marine water and inoculated (0.1 mL) on Marine Agar plates (Conda Laboratories, Madrid, Spain), incubated at 4\u20135\u00b0C for 15 days minimum for culturable heterotrophic bacteria (Cappello et\u00a0al., 2021), and in part stored at \u221220\u00b0C for shipment to and further analyses in microbiological labs in Italy (see below).

            "text": "A total of 186 morphologically diverse microbes was isolated from the biofilm and seawater samples collected from the Terra Nova Bay. One hundred and forty-six microorganisms were isolated from biofilms grown on PVC and PE artificial panels deployed at the four sampling sites (RB, PTS, TB, and AG; Figure\u00a01), and 40 from the surrounding seawater. The sampling campaign and the physical\u2013chemical parameters of the sampling sites were recently described in Caroppo et\u00a0al. (2022). Herein, samples were plated\u00a0- in some cases after a heat pre-treatment to enrich in spore forming microorganisms and/or being serially diluted\u00a0- on a variety of different isolation media (either with or without adding 2% w/v artificial sea salt) and incubated at three different temperatures, i.e., 4, 20 and 28\u00b0C, to capture as much as possible the cultivable diversity. All the selected microbes grew well on the media enriched with artificial sea salt, indicating that they are halotolerant, with only 28% of them strictly requiring salt addition to grow, being therefore considered obligate halophiles. For the microbial isolation, we\u00a0used a salt concentration (2% w/v) that is slightly lower than that of the Antarctic Ocean, ranging from 3 to 3.5% w/v. This was done in order to account for the expected saline gradients that were present in the sampling area: at the RB site due to its proximity to the wastewater treatment plant of Mario Zucchelli research station and at the AG site, where the meltwater from the glacier is entering the sea (Caruso, 2020; Caroppo et al., 2022; Caruso et al., 2022). The majority of the isolates grew well at the three different temperatures used for plate incubation, showing that they tended to be\u00a0psychrotolerant rather than psychrophilic. Only 8% grew better at 4\u00b0C in solid media, although their growth was detectable and generally abundant also at 20 and 28\u00b0C. By microscopical observation, 28 microorganisms were considered filamentous actinomycetes and 10 filamentous fungi (on the basis of the mycelium conformation, hyphae morphology and size, and in some cases spores\u2019 presence), while the remaining ones generically resembled cocci and bacilli. Geographical distribution, sampling depth, sample origin and morphology-based classification of the 146 biofilm microbial isolates and of the 40 seawater microbial isolates are reported in Supplementary Figures S1, S2, respectively.\nAll the 186 microbial isolates were primarily screened for their ability to produce laccase enzymes on MAM plates (Casciello et\u00a0al., 2017), added with 2% w/v artificial sea salt and supplemented with the soluble mediator ABTS (Yang et\u00a0 al., 2017) or with the dye azure B (Casciello et\u00a0al., 2017). MAM was previously reported as an adequate medium for such screenings since it is known to support the growth of different types of microorganisms, without inducing pigment production, which can interfere with colorimetric enzyme assays (Casciello et\u00a0 al., 2017). After a 2 week-long incubation at 20\u00b0C, 25 microorganisms (19 unicellular bacteria, 1 filamentous actinomycete and 5 filamentous fungi) were able to oxidize ABTS, and 20 microorganisms (13 unicellular bacteria, 2 filamentous actinomycetes and 5 filamentous fungi) were able to degrade the dye azure B (Supplementary Table SB). Among them, 15 isolates showed both the\nFrontiers in Microbiology 06 frontiersin.org\nA B\nFIGURE\u00a02 Laccase activity values detected in the crude extracts from the unicellular bacterial isolates M47, M61, M68, M70 and M73, assayed in 96-well plates at 20\u00b0C, on (A) 1 mM ABTS and (B) 1 mM 2,6-DMP, in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The absorbance was recorded immediately (t0) and 1, 5 and 24 h after substrate addition. The enzymatic activities are expressed as mU per mg of total proteins in the cellular extracts. Each sample was analysed in triplicate (mean \u00b1 standard deviation).

Geographical distribution, sampling depth, sample origin and morphology-based classification of these 30 microbial isolates are reported in Supplementary Figure S3.\nFollowing this primary screening, the selected active strains were grown in liquid media (differently designed according to the morphology-based classification of the isolates, see Materials and Methods) to test their laccase-like activity production, by assaying either acellular broths (for putative secreted enzymes) or crude extracts after cell lysis by sonication (for intracellular enzymes). A broad range of substrates, i.e., ABTS, 2,6-DMP, catechol, azure B, RBBR and RB5, was evaluated. Twenty-five isolates confirmed their ability to oxidize ABTS, albeit at different extent; in addition, few of them converted 2,6-DMP (6 isolates) and catechol (4 isolates), and/or degraded azure B (12 and 5 isolates, respectively). The five additional isolates oxidizing only azure B in solid assay, confirmed this unique activity in liquid. None of the tested strains showed any enzymatic activity on RBBR and RB5 as substrates (Supplementary Table SB).\nThe vast majority of these active microorganisms (21 isolates out of 30) originated from RB, which is the site located in front of the wastewater treatment plant discharge of the Mario Zucchelli station (Figure\u00a0 1). Twenty-one were classified as cocci/bacilli on the basis of their microscopic morphology. In these unicellular bacteria, the laccase activity was prevalently detected intracellularly (Supplementary Table SB). The remaining active few actinomycetes (3) and fungi (6), instead secreted the oxidative enzymes, but their activity was low and poorly reproducible (Supplementary Table SB). Consequently, following our enzymatic activity-based screening approach, further investigations focused on the five most active isolates (M47, M61, M68, M70, and M73), which were unicellular bacteria isolated from seawater samples (Figures\u00a02A,B). Almost all of these strains (M61, M68, M70, and M73) were isolated from RB samples, with the exception of M47 which was isolated from a TB sample. Details on a preliminary phenotypical characterization of the strains are reported in Supplementary Table SC. The intracellular enzyme preparations from these five selected isolates\noxidized both ABTS and 2,6-DMP at 20\u00b0C, with a signal corresponding to the enzymatic activity being detected already after 1 h and increasing within the 24 h of incubation. For all the strains, the activity on ABTS was higher than on 2,6-DMP (Figures\u00a02A,B). In this study, we\u00a0focused on the laccase-activity produced by the M68 isolate, since it showed a significantly higher activity within the 24 h of incubation: 3.05 mU/mg of total proteins in the cellular extract on ABTS and 1.77 mU/mg on 2,6-DMP (Figures\u00a0 2A,B). M68 did not show any activity either on catechol or azure B (Supplementary Table SB). The further investigation and in-depth taxonomical characterization of the other four positive strains will be\u00a0considered in future works.\n3.2. Halomonas sp. M68 characterization and Ant enzyme crude preparation\nM68 strain was isolated from a seawater sample collected at \u221220 m in RB and it was found to be\u00a0a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, low oxidase producing, glucose-sucrose-lactose not fermenting microorganism, producing orange pigmented colonies, with active proteolytic and phosphatase activities as assayed using fluorogenic substrates (Supplementary Table SC). This isolate grew without NaCl (both in solid and in liquid media) and tolerated up to 15% w/v (2.5 M) NaCl, with an optimal growth at 5% w/v (860 mM) NaCl. The sequencing of its 16S rDNA revealed that it belongs to the genus Halomonas, within the phylum Proteobacteria (\u03b3-subclass). Specifically, a 16S rDNA sequence identity of 100% was found with two strains of Halomonas meridiana (strain PR51-13 and strain DSM 5425).\nTo further characterize the laccase-like intracellular enzyme activity detected in M68 strain (no activity was detected in the acellular broth), an optimization of the growing and production conditions was attempted by evaluating the enzyme activity at different growth temperatures (from 4 to 30\u00b0C), NaCl concentrations (from 340 to 5,130 mM) and cultivation times (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h;\nFrontiers in Microbiology 07 frontiersin.org\nSupplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Anyway, no significant improvement in enzyme activity was observed; thus, the original growing conditions were maintained (growth at 20\u00b0C at 2% w/v artificial sea salt for 24 h). 2 mM CuSO4 was also added to the cultivation broth, since Cu2+ is a cofactor of laccases (Pollegioni et\u00a0al., 2015) and its addition to cultivation medium might increase laccase production (Ausec et\u00a0al., 2017; Casciello et\u00a0al., 2017; Berini et\u00a0al., 2018). Under these culture conditions, the enzymatic activity of the cellular extract on 5 mM ABTS increased of about six-times up to 3 mU/mg of total proteins in the cellular extract (3.15 \u00b1 0.38), compared to the activity detected in the absence of CuSO4 (0.55 mU/mg).\nFollowing partial precipitation of the proteins in the cellular extract with ammonium sulphate at 30% w/v of saturation, the enzymatic activity was recovered in the supernatant (SNP30). Treatment at percentages of ammonium sulphate higher than 30% w/v led to enzyme inactivation. The total laccase activity of SNP30 (tested on 5 mM ABTS) increased from 265 to 670 mU and the specific activity reached a figure of 9.70 \u00b1 0.96 mU/mg total proteins: the 2.5\u20133.1-fold increase in activity can result from both the removal of potentially interfering compounds or inhibitors and the positive\neffect of the increased ionic strength (see below). Notably, the laccase-like activity was not recovered after a dialysis step against 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, confirming the highest stability of the enzyme in the presence of salts. The SNP30 enzymatic preparation (that we\u00a0start hereby to name Ant laccase) was therefore directly used for the kinetic studies."

The distribution of the positive strains for laccase-like activity selected during the primary screening (30 out of 186) indicated that most of them (21) originated from RB site, from which most of the isolates of the collection came from. This is the most impacted site among the four sampled in this Antarctic campaign due to its proximity to the discharge of the wastewater treatment plant of Mario Zucchelli station (Caruso et\u00a0 al., 2022; Caroppo et\u00a0 al., 2022).

M68 was psychrotolerant and halotolerant. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequencing, it was attributed to the genus Halomonas (\u03b3-Proteobacteria), with a 100% sequence identity to two strains of H. meridiana (strain PR51-13 and strain DSM 5425). H. meridiana DSM 5425 is the type-strain for the H. meridiana species and it was originally isolated during a limnological survey in 1988 from saline lakes of the Vestfold Hills region (Antarctica; James et\u00a0al., 1990). Strain PR51-13 was identified as a member of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading bacterial consortia obtained through PAH enrichment from deep-sea water above the Southwest Indian ridge (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2015). In fact, members of the Halomonas genus tend to be\u00a0moderately to extremely halotolerant or halophiles and have been isolated from a variety of saline environments, such as marine water, hypersaline lakes, saline soils, meat-curing brines, and sewage treatment plants (Arahal et\u00a0 al., 2002). They have already been proposed as candidates for the production of different compounds of biotechnological and industrial relevance, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, ectoines, biosurfactants, bioemulsifiers and various halotolerant hydrolases (Yin et\u00a0 al., 2015; Biswas et\u00a0 al., 2022). An extracellular \u03b1-amylase from H. meridiana was isolated and characterized by Coronado and co-authors, showing 90% of its maximal activity even at NaCl concentrations higher than 15% (Coronado et\u00a0al., 2000). An azoreductase degrading Reactive Red 195 at 5\u201315% NaCl was also recently characterized from H. meridiana SAIBP-6 strain, isolated from marine sediments of Andaman Sea, India (Saha et\u00a0 al., 2022). Despite their potential, to our knowledge, no laccases have been identified and functionally characterized from these Halomonas spp. yet.\nThe Ant laccase that we\u00a0identified in Halomonas sp. M68 showed the highest aminoacidic sequence coverage with a copper resistance protein CopA from H. meridiana, consistently with the identification of M68 as a member of the same species. CopA was reported to have more than one biological function, playing a role in both copper resistance and as catalyst in oxidative reactions (Cha and Cooksey, 1991; Mills et\u00a0al., 1993). It accumulated intracellularly indicating that its main physiological role could be\u00a0 related to UV protection, pigmentation, sporulation, metal oxidation or copper homeostasis (Yang et\u00a0al., 2017). The proposed mode of action of CopA was reported to involve a methionine rich region, which binds several atoms of copper (Bielli and Calabrese, 2002; Xiao and\nWedd, 2011). Noteworthy, the production of Ant laccase is triggered by the culture medium addition of 2 mM CuSO4, leading to a 6-fold increase in enzyme activity. Cu2+ role in laccase active site is well-known as well as its modulation of laccase gene transcription and post-transcription modifications (D\u2019Souza et\u00a0al., 2006; Nakade et\u00a0al., 2013; Yang et\u00a0al., 2013; Passarini et\u00a0al., 2015; Pollegioni et\u00a0al., 2015; Theerachat et\u00a0al., 2019).\nAnt laccase preferential substrate was ABTS, and the highest activity was measured at acidic pH values (3.0\u20135.0), although it was mostly stable at pH \u2265 5.0, following a common behavior among laccases (Tonin et\u00a0al., 2016). It was also active on 2,6-DMP as a substrate, while neither dye-decolorizing activity, nor oxidation of catechol was detected.\nConcerning temperature, Ant laccase showed its maximum activity at around 40\u00b0C, which is lower than the optimal temperatures (70\u201380\u00b0C) frequently reported for laccases from both fungal and bacterial sources (Tonin et\u00a0al., 2016). This feature might be\u00a0expected considering that this enzyme is produced by a psychrotolerant marine Antarctic bacterium. Consistently, Ant laccase maintained at 10\u00b0C more than 40% of its maximal activity. This behavior hints at a cold-adaptation of Ant from an ancestral mesophilic precursor and this laccase could result particularly versatile and able to well adapt to sudden changes in temperatures of the surrounding environment. Similar thermostability results were previously reported only for a few laccases isolated from fungal strains (Wang et\u00a0al., 2009; Tian et\u00a0al., 2020), and in particular, for a laccase-like enzyme Lac1326 derived from a marine metagenomic library, whose optimum temperature for activity was found to be\u00a060\u00b0C (Yang et\u00a0al., 2018).\nAnt laccase was also shown to be\u00a0particularly stable, with 65% of its starting activity maintained even after 24 h incubation at 37\u00b0C: this could favor its use in bioremediation treatments in open environments, where there is no temperature control, or in the food industry when low to moderate heating is applied to preserve thermolabile components (Brijwani et\u00a0al., 2010; Yang et\u00a0al., 2017). Considering the role of oxygen in the laccase-catalyzed reaction (Fabbrini et\u00a0al., 2001; Ortner et\u00a0 al., 2015; Brenna et\u00a0 al., 2018), the dependence on temperature of oxygen solubility in water, and the relevant applications of this oxidase, future investigations should compare the performances of Ant laccase and mesophilic intracellular laccases at different oxygen pressure. Another major obstacle in using laccases in municipal and\nFrontiers in Microbiology 11 frontiersin.org\nindustrial wastewater treatment, which are known to contain significant amounts of salts, is represented by their sensitivity to halide ions, which causes their rapid inactivation (Theerachat et\u00a0al., 2019; Unuofin et\u00a0al., 2019). The Ant laccase from Halomonas sp. M68 showed favorable halotolerant features for such industrial applications (Espina et\u00a0al., 2021). Although it was not strongly activated by NaCl, as it has been reported for some laccases isolated from other marine derived strains (Wikke et\u00a0al., 2019), in the presence of 1 M NaCl it maintained 80% of its activity detected in salt-free conditions. A possible explanation is that Ant, under physiological conditions, is partially protected towards saline variations, since it is produced as an intracellular enzyme. In fact, halophilic and halotolerant bacteria living in hypersaline environments tend to avoid letting salts diffuse into their cells, by accumulating intracellularly osmolytes and various compatible solutes, in order to balance the osmotic pressure (Yin et\u00a0al., 2015). This phenomenon was also reported for two azoreductases isolated from Halomonas species, which were tolerant to NaCl but showed their highest activity in its absence (Eslami et\u00a0al., 2016; Tian et\u00a0al., 2019).\nFinally, Ant laccase proved to tolerate well the presence of organic solvents, such as DMSO, one of the most active organic compounds used to solubilize organic macromolecules (including lignin), and of surfactants, such as Tween-80, which can be\u00a0used in wastewater treatment and in lignin pretreatment prior to enzyme hydrolysis (Tonin et\u00a0 al., 2016). In fact, Ant laccase maintained approximately 50% of the activity detected in plain buffer at 10% DMSO or 5% Tween-80.\nWe can conclude that the various characteristics displayed by the Halomonas sp. M68 Ant laccase (i.e., cold-adaptation, and thermo-, halo- and solvent-tolerance) make it a promising candidate for biotechnological and industrial use. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a thermo- and halo-tolerant laccase isolated from a marine Antarctic bacterium. Foreseeing Ant laccase possible developments, future studies should be\u00a0devoted to favor its secretion by the homologous host or by a heterologous one. The extracellular localization of Ant laccase might in fact greatly facilitate protein recovery and its biotechnological use."
