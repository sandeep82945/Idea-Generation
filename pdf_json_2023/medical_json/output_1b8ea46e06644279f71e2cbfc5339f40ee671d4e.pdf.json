The immune system plays a crucial role in CRC development and progression, making it a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we analyzed transcriptomic data from CRC patients to investigate immune infiltration and identify potential therapeutic targets.\nMethod and results: we used CIBERSORT to analyze the immune infiltration in COAD samples and found that the high infiltration of M2 macrophages and neutrophils was associated with poor prognosis. Next, we identified NR4A1 as a potential therapeutic target based on its protective effect in two predict models. Using cancer therapeutics response analysis, we found that high expression levels of NR4A1were sensitive toOSI-930, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-tumor effects.\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that targeting NR4A1 with OSI-930 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for COAD patients with high levels of immune infiltration. However, further studies are needed to investigate the clinical efficacy of this approach.\nKEYWORDS\ncolon adenocarcinoma, immune infiltration, single cell sequencing, predictive model, precision medicine\n1 Introduction\nColon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a malignant tumor that arises from the glandular epithelium lining the colon, which is a part of the large intestine. It is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The 5-year survival rate for colon adenocarcinoma patients remains relatively low, ranging from 90% for localized disease to 14% for distant metastases, despite treatment advancements such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Early detection and treatment, particularly with surgery, are critical for improving survival rates (Galon et al., 2006; Siegel et al., 2020).\nResearch is ongoing to identify biomarkers and risk factors that may improve early detection and treatment options for colon adenocarcinoma patients, as well as to develop new targeted therapies and immunotherapies for advanced disease.

Studies have shown that the density and function of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment can affect the efficacy of cancer treatments and predict patient outcomes (Pages et al., 2005; Galon et al., 2006; Fridman et al., 2012). Therefore, understanding the immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment could provide insights into the development of effective cancer treatments for colon adenocarcinoma patients.\nHowever, Studying the role of immune infiltration in colon adenocarcinoma can be challenging due to the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, which involves various interacting immune and stromal cells. While immune infiltrates may predict clinical outcomes in some studies, it remains unclear how this information can guide clinical decision-making, including treatment selection. Further research is necessary to translate immune infiltration into actionable clinical information.\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to study the complexity of the tumor microenvironment in colon adenocarcinoma. scRNA-seq allows profiling of gene expression in individual cells providing new insights into the role of the immune system in tumor development and biomarkers for early detection and targeted therapies (Hanzelmann et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019; Korber et al., 2020).\nThe present study seeks to address the challenges by utilizing scRNA-seq in combination with bulk RNA sequencing data. Specifically, the integration of scRNA-seq data with bulk RNA sequencing data enables the identification of cell specific gene expression profiles, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. Additionally, this study aims to identify potential biomarkers for survival prediction and to develop new targeted therapies for COAD, with the ultimate goal of providing clinically relevant information that can inform treatment decisions."

Therefore, further validation studies and clinical testing are needed to assess the predictive performance of the model and determine its usefulness in clinical decision-making.\n3.3 Differential gene expression analysis and differential immune infiltration\nTo identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TCGACOAD and normal samples, we performed differential gene expression\nanalysis using the limma package. A total of 11,583 genes were found to be differentially expressed, with 8,191 genes upregulated and 3,392 genes downregulated in TCGA-COAD samples compared to normal samples (adjusted p-value <0.05 and |log2 fold change| > 1). The volcano plot and heatmap of DEGs is shown in Figures 2A, B.\nTo investigate the biological functions and pathways associated with these differentially expressed genes, we performed gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis (Figures 2C, D). Although these functions may not be directly implicated in immune infiltration, they are strongly linked to this process. Consequently, we employed CIBERSORT to conduct further investigation of the differential immune infiltration (Figure 2E).\nIn view of the significant differences observed in immune infiltration associated with the differentially expressed genes, we performed CIBERSORT again across all expression profiles to further elucidate this relationship. The bar plot and box plot\nFIGURE 3 Immune infiltration of tumor samples. (A) Bar plot showing the expression levels of all the genes in COAD patients.

The immune infiltration analysis revealed a significant difference in the composition of immune cells between tumor and normal tissues. In tumor samples, there was a decrease in the abundance of DC resting, eosinophils, macrophages M1, macrophages M2, mast cells resting, monocytes, NK cells activated, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, and Tregs (p < 0.05) compared to normal samples. On the other hand, macrophages M0, NK cells resting, and CD4+ memory activated were found to be significantly more abundant in tumor samples (p < 0.05). These findings suggest a potential role for these immune cell subsets in the development and progression of the tumor (Figure 3C). 3.4 The impact of distinct immune infiltration on survival To assess the impact of different immune cell infiltration on COAD patients\u2019 survival, we divided the COAD samples into two groups based on the median proportion of different abundance immune cell type. Our analysis revealed that the survival of patients was significantly impacted by the proportion ofmacrophagesM2 (HR= 1.75, Figure 4A) and neutrophils (HR = 1.76, Figure 4B). Higher proportions of macrophages M2 or neutrophils were associated with a worse prognosis, the proportions of other immune cells did not have a significant impact on patient survival (Figure 4C).\nFIGURE 4 Survival analysis of COAD patients base on the different immune infiltration.

The X-axis represents the survival time in days, and the Y-axis represents the survival probability. The p-value was calculated using the log-rank test.

(C) KM curves of immune cells with significant differences but no significant impact on survival.\nFrontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org07\nNext, we further investigated the genes related to neutrophils and macrophages. Due to the limitations in the annotation of singlecell RNA sequencing data, we could not specifically focus on macrophages M2 as the subtype could not be precisely divided. To obtain the genes representative of these immune cells, we analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing data of COAD samples using the Seurat package. The differentially expressed genes in CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells were identified using the FindAllMarkers\nFrontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org08\nfunction of Seurat package. The gene expression profiles of these cells were compared to that of other cell types to ensure their specificity. A total of 26 cell clusters were identified and annotated based on known cell type markers and functional annotations (Figures 5A, B). Cluster 14 was identified as neutrophils (markers: S100A9, S100A8, IL1B), cluster 16 as macrophages (markers:C1QB, C1QA, and SPP1) (Figure 5C). The distribution of cell types varied between tumor and normal samples, indicating a significant change in the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment. After filtering the differentially expressed genes, a total of 898 genes representing neutrophils and 1,088 genes representing macrophages were selected for subsequent analysis."

            "text": "To further evaluate the involvement of NR4A1 as a pivotal factor, we conducted a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to assess its expression levels and distribution. Our findings revealed that the distribution of NR4A1 was more extensive, and the expression levels were higher in tumor samples as compared to normal colon samples (Figures 8A, B). We obtained protein staining results for NR4A1 from the Human Protein Atlas for analysis. The results showed that the staining intensity of NR4A1 was stronger in COAD samples compared to normal colon samples (Supplementary Figure S3). These finding suggests that NR4A1 may play a role in the development and progression of colon cancer.\nTo analyze the correlation between NR4A1 expression and chemical compound sensitivities, we used the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) v2 database. This database contains gene expression data from various cancer cell lines and their responses to chemical compounds.\nTo focus on the large intestine, a site-specific filter was applied, and an interquartile multiplier cutoff of 1.5 was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, the correlation between the expression levels of NR4A1 and two compounds, OSI-930 and BRD-K50799972, was examined. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between OSI-930 and NR4A1 expression (Correlation: 0459, z-score: 3.02, Figure 8C), while BRD-K50799972 showed a negative correlation with NR4A1 expression (Correlation: \u22120.582, z-score: \u22124.31, Figure 8D).\nThe analysis suggests that OSI-930 and BRD-K50799972 have different sensitivities for the NR4A1 expression. This information could be useful in the development of targeted therapies for diseases that involve dysregulation of the NR4A1. For example, OSI-930 may be a potential candidate for patients who have higher sensitivity to the compound, while BRD-K50799972 may be useful for patients who have lower sensitivity to the compound. However, further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of these compounds in treating colon adenocarcinoma.\nFrontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org10"

            "text": "COAD is a common malignant tumor that has a high morbidity and mortality rate worldwide (Siegel et al., 2021). The complexity and heterogeneity of CRC have made it challenging to identify specific therapeutic targets, and there is an urgent need to develop new approaches to combat this disease. Recently, single-cell sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying cancer pathogenesis (Wei et al., 2023). In this study, we used single cell sequencing to identify key genes and pathways associated with COAD. Our approach allowed us to analyze the transcriptional profiles of individual cells, enabling us to identify cell type-specific changes in gene expression that would have been masked in bulk sequencing\nanalysis. By doing so, we aimed to improve our understanding of the disease and identify potential therapeutic targets that could help to improve patient outcomes.\nIn this study, we investigated various clinic features (Age, Gender, Stage, Relapse, and Histological type) and their association with patient outcomes. Surprisingly, our analysis did not reveal any significant direct link between clinic features and patient prognosis. These findings suggest that other factors, such as molecular alterations or immune cell infiltration, may have a more significant impact on patient outcomes in this particular cancer type.\nThe differential expression analysis identified a total of 11,583 genes that were significantly dysregulated between COAD and normal samples. These differentially expressed genes are likely to contribute to the differences in immune infiltration observed\nFrontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org11\nbetween the two groups (As Figure 3 shown). Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed multiple immuneassociated pathways that can impact various aspects of immune function and contribute to immune infiltration in different cancers. The Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Calcium signaling pathway, Viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor, Protein digestion and absorption, Hematopoietic cell lineage, DNA replication, Complement and coagulation cascades, cAMP signaling pathway, and Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) pathways were found to be associated with immune infiltration. These pathways are involved in immune cell migration, modulation of the inflammatory response, immune cell proliferation, differentiation, activation, T-cell activation, cytokine production, chemotaxis, immune response to viral infection, macrophage infiltration, development and differentiation of immune cells, recruitment of immune cells to the site of inflammation, and regulation of leukocyte trafficking and recruitment to the site of inflammation (Su et al., 2003; Ota et al., 2007). Hence, we focused on the immune heterogeneity between COAD samples. We found that different immune infiltrates in COAD can have varying impacts on patient prognosis. Specifically, patients with a higher proportion of macrophages M2 or neutrophils are associated with worse outcomes. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this association, we focused on genes from clusters related to macrophages M2 or neutrophils. Using these genes, we created two predictive models that can help identify patients who are at a higher risk of poor\nFrontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org12\noutcomes based on their immune infiltration patterns. These models have the potential to be used clinically to guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. The findings of our study highlight the potential of NR4A1 as a therapeutic target in COAD. The observed protective effect of NR4A1 in both models suggests its role in regulating tumor survival and relapse. Cancer therapeutics response analysis revealed that the expression level of NR4A1 can influence the response to specific drugs. High expression levels of NR4A1 may benefit from treatment with OSI-930, while those with low expression levels may respond better to BRD-K50799972. These results suggest that targeting NR4A1 expression may be a promising approach to improve cancer treatment outcomes.\nNR4A1, also known as Nur77, is a transcription factor that has been implicated in the development and progression of various types of cancer, including COAD. Studies have shown that NR4A1 plays a crucial role in the development and progression of various diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. NR4A1 is also involved in the modulation of cellular signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/ AKT/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways, through its transcriptional activity or protein-protein interactions (Li et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2018). Furthermore, the absence or loss of NR4A1 expression may result in an impaired ability to differentiate into M2 macrophages (Murphy et al., 2014).\nOSI-930 is a potent and selective inhibitor of c-Kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). OSI-930 has shown promising results in preclinical studies and has entered clinical trials as a potential anticancer agent (Malaise et al., 2009). In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that OSI-930 can inhibit c-Kit activity and downstream signaling pathways, leading to inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis (Garton et al., 2006). Additionally, OSI-930 has been shown to have synergistic effects with other anticancer agents, such as imatinib, in the treatment of c-Kit-positive tumors (Malaise et al., 2009). Therefore, targeting NR4A1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for COAD treatment. Although some studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of BRD-K50799972, there is currently limited research available on its efficacy and safety, and it has not yet progressed to the preclinical stage. Therefore, further investigation is needed to determine its potential as a therapeutic agent. For the purpose of this study, we have not included BRDK50799972 in our analysis or discussion.\nIn conclusion, our study analyzed the differential gene expression profiles and immune infiltration in COAD samples. We identified several differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with immune processes in COAD, which may contribute to immune infiltration and cancer progression. Specifically, we found that high expression levels of NR4A1 were associated with a better prognosis in COAD patients. We also identified OSI-930 as\na potential therapeutic agent for COAD patients with high NR4A1 expression levels. Our study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying COAD and identifies potential therapeutic targets for this disease. However, further experimental validation is required to confirm our findings."
