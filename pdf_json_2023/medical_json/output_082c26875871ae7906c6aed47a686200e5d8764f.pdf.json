    "abstractText": "Regeneration agendas and inbound tourism flows have long been considered a remedy for economic crisis. In port cities, a prominent role in urban regeneration is played by the waterfronts, which have been undergoing radical makeovers worldwide since the 1960s. The city of Cagliari stuck to the same recipe, promoting a series of regeneration initiatives and implementing a series of policies to boost the tourism sector. This study combines the use of primary and secondary sources and the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data to create a useful picture of both current reality and historical development of the city. It demonstrated that development strategies promoted in Cagliari, rather than balancing tourism promotion and local community needs, contributed to the amplification and acceleration of the touristification process. Therefore, many of the challenges posed by overtourism, dread in the literature, are today faced by Cagliari and its inhabitants. In addition, the study also identifies in the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic a unique opportunity to reverse the touristification process and to achieve a sustainable manner of tourism development. Therefore, it offers some policy recommendations to define principled urban regeneration models, alternatives which are able to achieve urban revitalization while avoiding touristification.",

            "text": "Regeneration agendas and inbound tourism flows have long been considered a remedy for economic crisis [1,2]; physical urban beautification and immaterial cultural resources are commonly integrated to attract people and capital [3]. By analyzing the relationships between urban regeneration and tourism, Judd and Fainstein [4] noticed the tendency to create \u201ctourism bubbles\u201d where a high number of tourist attractions are crowded together. This is particularly evident in historic city centers, where the high concentration of heritage and cultural elements [5] as well as a large part of the retail and accommodation business [6] promotes urban vitality and preserves the city\u2019s authenticity [7]. In port cities, a prominent role in urban regeneration is played by the waterfront, as the presence of the port increases the power of attraction of the city [8]. For this reason, a series of waterfront regeneration projects have proliferated all over the world since the 1960s [8,9], and Cagliari is not an exception [10\u201312]. However, to be successful, these initiatives need to be flanked by regeneration projects of the historic city centers proximate to the port [13]. Aware of the interconnected roles of the port and of the historic city center behind it, the port authority and the local Council of Cagliari implemented synergic development strategies that helped to boost tourism [12,13]. The implemented regeneration projects have produced the desired results, as the city has enjoyed a significant increase in tourist influx, providing considerable benefits to the local economy. Unfortunately, though, every rose has its thorn; former residents of the historic city center are encountering increasing difficulties in living their neighborhood and their quality of life is relentlessly deteriorating. This is in line with the problems\nSustainability 2023, 15, 4061. https://doi.org/10.3390/su15054061 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2023, 15, 4061 2 of 29\nfaced by other cities worldwide that experience high levels of tourist intensity and visitor pressure [7,14\u201320]. On the one hand, urban tourism creates new employment opportunities and stimulates local economic growth; on the other hand, it poses significant challenges to the fulfillment of residents\u2019 needs [21]. Tourism constitutes one of the city\u2019s main economic drivers, and thus it is expected to guide the city\u2019s development, bring vitality and dynamism, ensure better infrastructure, provide better public services, increase employment, and improve the quality of life of its residents, [21] WTO 2012, but it actually often worsens residents\u2019 living conditions [22], determining social tensions [20,23\u201326], and causing the displacement of former residents [27\u201330]. There is plenty of literature analyzing the impacts of tourism on cities worldwide [31\u201333]. Initial studies praised tourism\u2019s positive effects [34], but, within a short time, a large number of studies identified pressing problems related to unbridled tourism growth [35]. In 2005 Gotham introduced the concept of tourism gentrification to draw attention to tourism activities as new drivers of gentrification [36,37]. The term \u201ctouristification,\u201d which combines the words \u201ctourism\u201d and \u201cgentrification\u201d, rapidly became popular among scholars [38\u201342] to indicate the production of space for tourist purpose, implicating the change of the essence of entire neighborhoods [43,44]. An extraordinary number of papers accurately describe the characteristics of the touristification processes and related consequences for cities around the world [37\u201339,45\u201350]. Nonetheless, only a small amount of research investigates the interrelationship between urban planning and tourism development [51]. This study responds to this gap by offering an empirical contribution to the academic debate concerning urban regeneration and touristification through an analysis of the case study of Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy), one never conducted before, which enquires whether regeneration programs developed in the city secured improved living conditions for everyone, or, rather, encouraged touristification. This contribution extends the knowledge of touristification, thanks to the interpretation of the phenomena observed, which conducts to the identification of the underlying dynamics and contextual conditions that determine touristification, allowing for the formulation of explanations that go beyond the peculiarities of this case study, and providing insights on a wider touristification phenomena. The aim is to identify principled urban regeneration models, which are resistant to speculative pressures in order to simultaneously achieve urban revitalization and avoid touristification processes. For this reason, the paper zooms out from the results of this site-specific case study to a wider perspective to offer strategic policies recommendations to local governments, local communities and the private sector, encouraging the shape of vibrant neighborhoods, welcoming and livable, for both residents and tourists. The analysis is divided into six sections. In the first one, an introduction to the topic is provided; in the second one, the existing literature is reviewed; in the third one, essential information about the case study is provided; in the fourth one, the comprehensive multi-method approach specifically tailored for this study is illustrated; in the fifth one, results are presented; in the sixth one, results are discussed and conclusions are drawn, together with the report of contributions and limitations of the study and suggestions and recommendations for future research."

According to the 2030 Agenda, since tourism is strictly related to assets such as urban infrastructure, accessibility, and cultural and natural heritage, it can promote regeneration, thus providing safe, affordable, resilient, smarter, and greener cities for both tourists and residents [52]. At the turn of the millennium in southern Europe, urban and cultural policies were aiming for tourism to revitalize historic districts, which, once redeveloped,\nSustainability 2023, 15, 4061 3 of 29\nwould attract more tourists [39]. Tourism, culture, leisure, and entertainment assumed central roles in urban regeneration by boosting local reputation, raising property values, encouraging investments and creating new jobs [53\u201355]. Moreover, tourism-oriented urban regeneration is more efficient in generating surplus value than the traditional model of urban redevelopment [56]. Therefore, cities worldwide have committed wholeheartedly to marketing themselves [57], registering a dramatic increase in the number of tourists in the last two decades [58]. Indeed, apart from the recent recession caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic [18], yearly growth rates of tourism have exceeded those of most other sectors [59]. The strong increase in the number of visitors has made tourism filter into urban areas that had so far been unharmed by touristification processes [2]. Consequently, cities, and particularly their historic centers, have been adapted for tourist amusement and investors\u2019 profit, transforming them into \u201cleisure-oriented consumption arena(s)\u201d [56] and destinations for mass tourism [60]. The concept of touristification shares many features with that of gentrification, but they substantially differ from one another, because tourists do not replace the resident population in the long term, due to their temporary stay [39]. Nevertheless, several studies associate touristification processes with a series of negative impacts on the physical, social and economic environment of the destination [33,61]. McKinsey and WTTC [62] distinguish five challenges: alienation of local residents, degradation of the tourist experience, overload of infrastructure, damage to nature, and risks to culture and heritage. Moscardo and Murphy [63] (2014: 2539) list \u201cinflation, increases in housing prices, loss of social networks, an influx of temporary strangers, increased crime, and tourists demonstrating undesirable behavior to local children\u201d. Koens and Postma [33] report that visitors exacerbate the already pressing issues in the city, such as lack of water and waste disposal, and that residents\u2019 quality of life is infringed by tourists\u2019 antisocial behavior, noise, and a general sense of insecurity. Alexandri and Janoschka [64] highlight that annoyance easily evolves into a sense of unhoming. Diaz-Parra and Jover [65] admonish against the loss of authenticity and the ruination of the pleasure of living in and visiting the city. Koens and Melissen [66] link the process of touristification with reductions in housing availability and facilities for residents. Cocola-Gant and Gago [28] underline the sense of loss and frustration experienced by local communities and the compromission of their quality of life, undermined by daily disruption. G\u00f6ssling et al. [67] add the privatization of public places, high tourist-to-resident ratios and commercial gentrification. Peeters et al. [68] identify a series of impacts of overtourism and classify them into three categories: environmental, economic, and socio-cultural. In the environmental category, they catalogue increased water, land, air, noise, and visual pollution, waste disposal problems, infrastructure congestion, overcrowding, and damage to natural, historical, and architectural sites. In the economic category, they list price inflation, reductions in the availability of goods and services, a strong impact of seasonality, the degradation of sectors of employment other than tourism, increases in infrastructure-maintenance costs, reductions in infrastructure accessibility, and the degradation of the destination\u2019s image. In the sociocultural category, they include infrastructure degradation, deterioration of residential areas, marginalization of the residential population, higher levels of hostility between visitors and residents, increased antisocial behaviors, and degradation of the sense of safety, together with modification of recreational areas, relinquishment of traditions and values, and a decline in morals, thus ultimately losing community spirit, pride, and cultural identity. Sari and Nazli [69], in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, add the risk of contagious disease. Furthermore, Morris [70] highlights the changes brought about by tourism in the prepandemic area, which concern not only the physical aspect of the city, but also its citizens\u2019 daily lives and their sense of relations, thus affecting the cultural identity of the place itself. For example, small businesses predominantly selling their products and services to local communities, such as markets, butchers\u2019 shops, bakeries, hair salons, bookshops, etc., have been pushed-out from the center [71] and their stores have been turned into kitsch souvenir shops [72]. Accordingly, the working population has left agricultural and manufacturing jobs and flocked to hospitality- and tourism-related positions, altering thereby its compo-\nSustainability 2023, 15, 4061 4 of 29\nsition and identity [73]. This transformation has been encouraged by web-based digital platforms of peer-to-peer exchange services for hospitality, which stimulate an explosive growth of the offer of private rented accommodations [33], thus encouraging the transfer of properties from the residential market to the more profitable tourism market [74]. Indeed, since landlords find short term rentals more attractive than long-term ones, they substitute for tenants with tourists [28], thus increasing the quota of tourists in the residential population [67]. The conversion from the residential to the tourism market determines both a decrease in housing supply [67] and the consequent increase in rental pressure, which results in an increase in real estate values and rents [75]. The inevitable outcomes are gentrification, displacement and segregation of former inhabitants [30,76], which leads to population decline [77]. Celata and Romano [78] argue that the spread of web-based short-term rental booking platforms plays a crucial role in residents\u2019 displacement and in the transformation of city-morphology. In addition, some scholars suggest that web-based digital platforms of peer-to-peer exchange services for hospitality might disrupt the traditional accommodation sector [79], particularly undermining B&Bs and hotels due to its impact on their occupancy rates [80] and, consequently, on room rates [81]."

Materials and Methods This study examines the policies implemented in Cagliari to boost the tourism sector and the observable changes, both in the physical aspects of the city and in the socioeconomic characteristics of the local community. Existing similar studies are reviewed to tailor a methodology for this case study. Cocola-Gant [43] explores how residents in the city center of Barcelona feel about the tourism-led transformation of their place through participant observation, the conducting of 56 in-depth interviews with residents and key-informants and a survey of 220 households. Amrhein et al. [14] interviewed 12 representatives of the anti-overtourism movement in the Balearic Island of Mallorca to understand impacts determined by overtourism. Ardura et al. [105] demonstrate the correlation between increases in tourist arrivals and in new wealth residents in Madrid and rising rents. Jover and D\u00edaz-Parra [39] investigate the social impacts of tourism on the historic center of Seville through the analysis of demographic changes. Cocola-Gant and Gago [28] consult the Short-Term Rental National Register and the website Airdna.co to verify the number of listings and their type (i.e., entire home, private room, shared room). In addition, they conducted 25 in-depth interviews with residents and key informants and concluded that a buy-to-let gentrification process is in progress in Lisbon. This research adopts an empirical approach which combines the use of primary and secondary sources and the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data to allow the creation of a useful picture of both the historical development of the city and its current reality. Firstly, a wide range of bibliographic sources, press materials, and official documents was examined (i.e., the Local Plan, the Port plan and its technical adaptations, the Plan for the historic center, the new Plan for the historic center) to become familiar with the process of regeneration promoted by the local council. Secondly, quantitative data available from official secondary sources was interpreted to understand the economic and social trends. Longitudinal analysis was conducted on quantitative data published by the Municipality of Cagliari, which gathered various data sources. In particular, data on population trends, household composition, foreign citizens, the labor market, the business fabric, tourists\u2019 arrivals and nights spent in Cagliari, cruise passengers embarked, disembarked, and in transit in Cagliari, ferry passengers arrived in Cagliari, airplane passengers arrived in and departed from Cagliari, and the number of registered companies in different business sectors were considered. In addition, longitudinal analysis was also conducted on the trends in the supply of different types of tourist accommodation in Cagliari between 2013 and 2021, on the basis of data provided by\nFigure 15.

            "heading": "6. Discussion and Conclusions",
            "text": "The case study analysis depicts a city that received a radical makeover to please the different types of tourists, thus becoming increasingly unwelcoming to residents. Transforming itself into what Sequera [56] defines as a \u201cleisure-oriented consumption arena\u201d, Cagliari lost the pleasures of long habitation and aroused a sense of unhoming in its former residents, as dreaded by Diaz-Parra and Jover [65] and Alexandri and Janoschka [64]. Thanks to its privileged location in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Cagliari is easily accessible and a well-liked port of call for cruise itineraries. Aware of the city\u2019s potentialities, the local council followed the example of many port cities, as illustrated by Andrade et al. and Pages Sanchez [9,116], working towards tourism development. To this end, beautification projects of the waterfront and of the historic center have been implemented and plans and policies to attract tourists have been formulated, copying the examples already developed in port cities worldwide [57]. Efforts devoted to increasing the attractiveness of the city have been demonstrated to be successful, according to tourism statistics. Indeed, tourist arrivals and nights spent in Cagliari increased, as well as air passengers and ferry passengers embarking, disembarking, and transitioning in Cagliari. The number of cruise passengers experienced a positive trend overall, even if characterized by some significant fluctuations, that, according to both the president of the port authority and the general director of Cagliari Cruise Port, are not alarming, since high volatility is intrinsic in the cruise sector and a characteristic of all ports [131,132]. However, development strategies, rather than balancing tourism promotion and local community needs, pandered to the rising touristification pattern, deliberately contributing to the amplification and acceleration of the touristification process that was as of yet in the bud. Coherently with the definition of touristification provided by Gotham [37], tourism became the driver of gentrification in Cagliari. Therefore, many of the challenges associated with overtourism, as dreaded in the literature, are today faced by Cagliari and its inhabitants. The most palpable is the physical transformation of the city, which became undoubtedly more appealing, but also more impersonal and anonymous, similar to thousands of port cities worldwide. As observed by Morris [70], Van Der Borg [71] and Connolly [72] in Sydney, Venice and Dubrovnik, respectively, the vast majority of historic little businesses serving the local community turned into souvenirs shops or were converted into food services, so that residents now experience severe difficulties in their daily lives. On the contrary, tourists find everything they wish and more in the heart of the city, even a medical center working 24/7, specifically designed for tourists. In this way, the cultural identity itself is undermined, as Macleod [73] warned. Although figures show a flourishing economy based on tourism-related activities, residents\u2019 quality of life, is anything but improved. Privatization of public space and the commercial gentrification depicted in the literature [67], are fully realized in Cagliari, infringing the quality of life of residents, as illustrated by Koens and Postma [33]. Indeed, the tourism-friendly road-closure initiatives to make way for restaurant dehors and bar tables have given residents great stress related to the noise, smell and garbage. The result is obvious: as illustrated by Cocola-Gant and Gago [28], residents abandon the neighborhood and homeowners either substitute tenants with tourists or sell their houses to tourism entrepreneurs, who will transform them into B&Bs, thus further fostering the touristification process in an endless vicious circle. This results in a significant increase in the supply of tourism accommodation, which in the majority of cases consists of the entire house. The promising prospects of the tourism industry have encouraged entrepreneurs investing in the sector, as demonstrated by variations in the number of registered companies in different businesses. This is also an aspect studied by scholars like Macleod [73], who argues that the working population leaves agricultural and manufacturing jobs and flocks to hospitality- and tourism-related positions.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 4061 23 of 29\nNonetheless, residents were exasperated by the increasing nuisances, so they organized themselves and invited all frustrated inhabitants to collaborate in identifying problems and possible solutions. The flyer saying, \u201cTHAT\u2019S ENOUGH\u201d, that they posted on the walls of the city center is emblematic of the annoyances that they cannot tolerate any longer. Data examined also show a terrible crisis of tourism sector caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the latter\u2019s dying down is now giving way to the return of overtourism. There is now a unique opportunity to reverse the touristification process and to get into a sustainable way of urban regeneration, which balances tourism development with social well-being and environmental protection, as required by the 2030 agenda. This requires redefining tourism as a sustainable form of economic growth, one maintaining the right balance between living, working and visiting and minimizing the adverse impacts determined by tourist activities. Evidence emergent from this research leads to the formulation of the following policy recommendations. First of all, the radical reconsideration of the role of housing is necessary. Properties need to return to providing accommodation for residents, rather than for tourists. To achieve this, it is necessary to reverse the process of home transformation into B&Bs, by making long-term rentals more profitable than short ones, through a system of incentives, penalties, and regulations. For example, heavy taxes should be applied on vacation rentals, while fiscal benefits should be provided to landlords who rent their property to long-term tenants. In addition, public regulations should set the maximum nights which landlords can rent to tourists annually and should not grant permission to arrange short-term lettings in high rent-pressure areas to second property owners. In this way, all the dwellings that are not permanently inhabited would be forced to return to the long-term rental market in order to alleviate supply constraints in the housing market. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to reduce unlicensed accommodations, which also raises issues of taxation and health and safety. Apart from detection measures, awareness-raising initiatives would serve the purpose. Moreover, public policies are needed to simultaneously provide security of tenure to tenants and title-holders against rent default and illegal occupation. Secondly, to preserve the local cultural identity, it is necessary to counteract the monoculture of shops and facilities in the city center. To this end, the municipal authority should place a cap on shops targeting tourists and prohibit the opening of extra shops over that limit. Thirdly, tourist crowds need to be properly managed. In order to reduce the pressure on overcrowded icons, daytrips should be discouraged, visitors should be offered alternative destinations, and seasonality should be reduced. Accordingly, guided tours should be promoted in less visited areas and events, celebrations, festivals, and cultural initiatives should be organized in off-peak season. The adoption of dynamic pricing discourages bookings in already popular areas at peak demand and, vice versa, fosters reservations in zones in low demand. In addition, it is beneficial to limit daily cruise ship arrivals, so that the city center is not clogged up by cruise passengers. Furthermore, a maximum number of participants in guided tours should be set, in order to avoid obstructing the narrow streets of the historic districts. Fourthly, stakeholders, local communities, and grassroots organizations have to be involved in any decision-making process, from the very first steps, when strategic decisions are not taken yet, to the after-completion monitoring. Informal gatherings, festivals and events should be organized to stimulate active participation in relaxed contexts, which can facilitate networking and spontaneous collaboration. These recommendations are not exhaustive, and definitely not a panacea for overtourism issues in any city. On the contrary, each case study needs to be carefully analyzed and custom-made policies have to be tailored to fit the local context.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 4061 24 of 29\nThis site-specific study is of primary importance for the evaluation of the regeneration projects developed in Cagliari, but it would benefit from a complementary analysis of landscape changes that might detect reinvestment of capitals, thus strengthening the hypothesis of touristification. In addition, more quantitative and qualitative analysis that underpin the mechanisms and causes of outcomes observed would be beneficial. In particular, quantitative data analyzed in this study refer to the city of Cagliari as a whole. More deeply-probing studies based on the analysis of data referred to the various districts would allow for more accurate reflection. The pioneering approach illustrated in this study can be easily applied in other contexts, in order to compare a wide spectrum of case-study investigations, which would allow for generalization of findings, thus broadening the knowledge on the subject matter. This study was conducted shortly after the halt of tourism flows caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic; it would be interesting to monitor the post-pandemic recovery to verify whether overtourism processes resurface or more sustainable models are adopted. In addition, the analysis of different case studies located in similar Italian and international port cities would provide new insights and understanding of the mechanisms governing the processes of touristification. Comparison among diverse case studies would allow to better understand the role played by the various factors in determining sustainable urban regeneration or in fostering touristification, thus corroborating the effectiveness of the strategies here identified to shape vibrant neighborhoods, welcoming and livable, for both residents and tourists. It would also be worthwhile to investigate how ICT and big data could support advancement in sustainable tourism, by monitoring policy impacts, smoothing the decisionmaking process, customizing the tourist offer and minimizing adverse effects of tourism development, thus creating opportunities for economic, social, and environmental development, as required by the 2030 agenda.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.\nData Availability Statement: Data sources and links to datasets are reported in the reference list.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences 1.
