            "text": "As components of cracked gas, C2H4 and C2H2 are important raw materials for the synthesis of various organic compounds such as polyethylene, a-ethynyl alcohols, and acrylic acid derivatives.1\u20133 The preparation of these value-added products generally requires a high-purity feed gas. In industry, pure C2H4 is realized by solvent absorption or selective catalytic hydrogenation from cracked gas, which are energy consuming processes.4,5 Meanwhile, the recovery of high-purity C2H2 is generally ignored in this process.\nAdsorptive separation using porous materials is more environmentally friendly and energy efficient, and is regarded as a promising future separation technology.6\u201311 As emerging porous materials, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs), derived from the self-assembly of organic ligands and inorganic nodes, demonstrate great opportunities to distinguish these two kinds of gas molecules by dedicated framework regulations, despite them having nearly identical molecular dimensions and physical properties.12\u201315 For example, the MOFmaterials SIFSIX-Cu-i7\ned Chemical Engineering, Nanjing Tech duanjingui@njtech.edu.cn eering, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing u.cn\nn (ESI) available: Synthesis and PXRD, TGA, IR, sorption isotherms, tting parameters. CCDC 2211444\u2013 raphic data in CIF or other electronic sc00877k is work.\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nand NKMOF-1-Ni16 exhibit minimal trade-off between adsorption capacity and selectivity, while the exible UTSA-300 (ref. 17) demonstrates gating separation of these mixtures. However, they all produce lower purity C2H2 during desorption, even for the sieving materials, as both C2H2 and C2H4 molecules can interact with strong binding sites, or the more or less exibility of the sieving frameworks allows a certain amount of coadsorption.18,19\nMOFs with free carboxylic acids might be potential light hydrocarbon separation materials due to their remarkable characteristics of being a hydrogen bonding acceptor (O\u2013H) and donor (C]O).20,21 However, these MOFs have never been systematically investigated or intentionally designed for highperformance gas separation,22\u201324 due to the signicant coordination activity of carboxylic acids in MOF construction. We are interested in nely tuning MOFs to achieve efficient gas separations.25\u201328 Herein, evolved from the interpenetrated dia topology,29 a new family of 6-c MOFs (termedNTU-71 toNTU-73) with carboxylic pincers were designed based upon a C2v symmetric ligand of 3,5-di(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (HL) and the hybrid ions with different radii (SiF6\n2\u2212 (dSi\u2013F: 1.690 \u00c5), TiF6 2\u2212 (dTi\u2013F: 1.886 \u00c5) and ZrF6 2\u2212 (dZr\u2013F: 1.983 \u00c5)). Among them, the distance of their carboxylic pincers has been nely tailored, and thus, they may approach those found in crab-like systems (Scheme 1). Very interestingly, NTU-72 exhibits a high C2H2/ C2H4 selectivity and great ability for recovery of both highly pure C2H4 (99.95%) and C2H2 (99.36%). This excellent separation performance is due to the stabilization of a C2H2 tetramer by a couple of carboxylic pincers in the optimized pore geometry and size in NTU-72.\nChem.

It crystallizes in a tetragonal I4122 space group with the formula of [Cu(HL)2SiF6]$xguest (Table S1\u2020). Its asymmetric unit includes one ligand, half a Cu2+ ion and half a SiF6 2\u2212 ion (Fig. S1\u2020). The charge of all the Cu2+ ions in NTU-71 is balanced by SiF6 2\u2212 ions, and thus, all the HL ligands are neutral. The single Cu node here is coordinated by four imidazole nitrogen atoms from four independent HL and two F atoms from two SiF6\n2\u2212 anions. Meanwhile, the three general branching points of the ligand take part in the coordination with the Cu nodes by two imidazole N atoms, while the carboxylate sites are free. As a third component of this framework, two F atoms from the SiF6\n2\u2212 anion join the coordination of the adjacent Cu node, yielding two helical chains in this 3D framework (Fig. S2\u2020). Obviously, two channels with densely incorporated carboxylic groups can be observed along the b- and c-axis (Fig. 1a and S3 and S4\u2020). Like crab pincers, these carboxylate groups are packed in pairs throughout the whole\nlic pincers along the b-axis (a); view of the pincers arranged alternately cers (c and d).

In addition, these carboxylic pincers are also available in another semiregular channel with an aperture size of 3.9 \u00d7 5.6 \u00c52 (Fig. 1d). To understand this structure better, topology analysis was performed. Cu(HL)2 is an interpenetrated framework, of which each net can be simplied as a classical dia topology. Interestingly, these interpenetrated dia nets are then bridged by a 2-connected SiF6\n2\u2212 anion, yielding a new 6-c topology with a point symbol of {4^8.6^7} (Fig. S5\u2020)."

At 298 K, they all show relatively higher C2H2 uptakes compared with C2H4. Interestingly, the C2H2 uptakes (10.6 cm\n3 g\u22121 and 8.2 cm3 g\u22121) at 1 kPa are almost 13\u201314 times higher than that of C2H4 (0.8 cm3 g\u22121 and 0.6 cm3 g\u22121) in NTU-71 and NTU-73, and this ratio (15.8 cm3 g\u22121 vs. 1.0 cm3 g\u22121) increases to 16 in NTU-72 (Fig. S22\u2020). These higher uptake ratios reect preferred affinity of the three frameworks toward C2H2 over C2H4. The adsorption selectivity of C2H2/C2H4 (v/v, 1/99) in these three MOFs was predicted by ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) (Fig. 3c and S23\u2013S35\u2020).31,32 The low-pressure C2H2 adsorption selectivity of NTU-72 (\u223c441) is much higher than that of both NTU-71 (\u223c58) and NTU-73 (\u223c147), and is also higher than that of ZUL-200 (60),33 NTU-69 (49),34 SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (45),7 and JCM-1 (9).35 In addition, the C2H2 adsorption selectivities remain as high as 26, 56 and 38 at 1 bar. Particularly, the selectivity of NTU-72 is only surpassed by the benchmark UTSA-200 (6320),36 ZU-33 (1100),37 and ZUL-series (175 and 114),33 and is higher than most of the well known MOFs.7,38\nTo explore the reason for such high selectivities, isosteric heats of adsorption (Qst) of C2H2 and C2H4 were calculated (Fig. 3d and S36\u2013S41\u2020). The Qst values of C2H4 at low pressure (36.8, 36.7 and 35.7 kJ mol\u22121) are all lower than that of C2H2 (42.4, 43.5, and 40.9 kJ mol\u22121) for the NTU-series. Similar to the higher C2H2 uptake, the adsorption enthalpy difference of NTU72 (6.7 kJ mol\u22121) is higher than that of NTU-71 (5.6 kJ mol\u22121) and NTU-73 (5.2 kJ mol\u22121). This may be due to the ne tting of the pore geometry and size in NTU-72 to the C2H2 molecule,\nch, where dO/O increases at the sub-angstrom level.\nChem.

Pure C2H4 passed through the sample bed as the rst component (4.2 min g\u22121), while C2H2 is retained in the column (Fig. 4a). The mixtures of C2H2 and C2H4 were detected at about 71.1 min g\u22121. This result shows that highly pure C2H4 (99.95%) can be directly collected in 66.9 min g\n\u22121 at the adsorption stage. According to the sample weight and gas velocity, NTU-72 could produce 331.1 cm3 (STP) per g of pure C2H4 from this mixture. To conrm the selective adsorption, the saturated adsorbents were then swept by helium at 298 K until no signal was detected. Subsequently, C2H2 was desorbed by rapid heating (up to 323 K), and its purity is approximately 99.36% (Fig. 4b and S42 and S43\u2020). Therefore, as an emerging example, NTU-72 can deliver both highly pure C2H4 and C2H2 in one adsorption/desorption cycle, although the recovery of polygrade C2H4 has been widely reported (Table S2\u2020). Structural stability was then conrmed by cycling breakthrough experiments, where nearly the same separation curves were displayed (Fig. 4c). Further experiments with varied gas velocity (2 and 10 cm3 min\u22121) also showed obvious separation, and the C2H4 productivity (319.6 and 323.8 cm3 (STP) per g) has hardly suffered any impact (Fig. 4d and S44\u2020).\nTo gain better understanding of the separation performance, C2H2- and C2H4-loaded NTU-72 crystals were investigated at 298 K.39 As expected, both gases interact with the carboxylic sites (Fig. S45 and S46\u2020). For NTU-72IC2H2, the occupancy of C2H2 was rened to be 1, which corresponds to 30.5 cm3 g\u22121, slightly\n4608 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 4605\u20134611\nlower than the amount in the C2H2 adsorption experiment (41 cm3 g\u22121) at 1 bar. This difference may be caused by two reasons: (1) the C2H2 molecules at other free space are strongly disordered and hard to be accurately modelled; (2) part of the C2H2 escaped during the sealing of the glass tube by using a hot candle. Despite this, the position and geometry of the adsorbed C2H2 molecules can be clearly identied in this conned nanospace. The C2H2 molecules are conned in the channel through three types of hydrogen bonds in different binding geometries (Fig. 5a and b). Acting as an acceptor and a donor, the OCOOH and OHCOOH moieties connect the terminal hydrogen and carbon atoms of a C2H2 molecule. In addition, the OHCOOH moiety also forms a hydrogen bond with another C2H2 molecule, resulting in close packing of the two gas molecules with intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, the terminal HC2H2 forms hydrogen bonds with CC2H2 from its symmetrically equivalent molecule, so that a C2H2 tetramer with C2h symmetry is formed periodically in NTU-72 (Fig. S47\u2013 S49\u2020), which is different from the S4 symmetric C2H2 tetramer in SIFSIX-Cu-i.7 Although the C2H2 clusters have been investigated,20,21 a compact C2H2 tetramer with C2h symmetry being stabilized by chelating carboxylic pincers is found for the rst time. Sharply in contrast, two types of hydrogen bonds are observed in NTU-72IC2H4 (Fig. 5c and d and S50\u2013S52\u2020). Particularly, dCC2H4/H\u2013OCOOH (2.705 \u00c5) is much longer than that of dCC2H2/H\u2013OCOOH (1.871 and 2.588 \u00c5), as well as the longer dOCOOH/H\u2013OC2H4, reecting relative weak carboxylic\u2013 C2H4 interaction. Furthermore, no intermolecular interaction is found between the two C2H4 molecules, as their distance is far. Therefore, the carboxylic sites contribute mainly to the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "The water/air stability of NTU-72 was then evaluated at room temperature. As shown in Fig. S53,\u2020 NTU-72 retained a polyhedral shape aer air treatment, but some changes occurred in the shape aer water treatment. Single crystal X-ray analysis showed that the water treated crystal (NTU-72IH2O, for 72 h) retains the framework of the as-synthesized phase (Table S1\u2020), conrmed further by PXRD analysis. Additionally, adsorption measurements revealed that the CO2 capacity of all treated samples is consistent with that of fresh samples, except for a slight decrease in the air treated sample for 72 h. These results conrm that NTU-72 has good water and moisture robustness (Fig. 6a and b). Considering the structure, the maintained crystallinity ofNTU-72 is due to the relatively strong Cu\u2013N bond, similar to that of NTU-67, having a highly robust framework with a Cu\u2013N coordination sphere also.39 In addition, the crystal structure of NTU-72IH2O shows that a couple of carboxylic pincers bind a tetra-water cluster via short hydrogen bonds (dO/O: 2.586\u20132.662 \u00c5), which may provide a blocking effect for other water molecules to reach the coordination bonds (Fig. 6c)."

            "text": "In conclusion, as needed for the pure C2 hydrocarbons, we have nely tuned a new family of carboxylic-functionalized MOFs and afforded NTU-72 with high adsorption C2H2/C2H4 selectivity as well as unprecedented recovery of highly pure C2H4 and C2H2. The carboxylic pincers contribute to the recognition of a C2H2 tetramer, and the tted pore geometry/size enforces synergistic binding and restricts this cluster to be released in a pure form. In addition, this material is stable in water and moisture environments. The foregoing results not only present an excellent MOF for energy-saving C2 hydrocarbon purication, but also provide a novel approach for the selective binding of gas clusters for designing advanced MOFs."
