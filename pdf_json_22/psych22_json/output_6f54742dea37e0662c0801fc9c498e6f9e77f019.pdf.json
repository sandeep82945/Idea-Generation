Methods: Fifty- three participants with lived experience of psychosis viewed three videos: (i) people with lived experience sharing their experiences of recovery; (ii) mental health professionals presenting traditional biomedical conceptualizations of psychosis; and (iii) mental health professionals presenting recovery perspectives. Participants provided baseline clinical and demographic information, and postviewing ratings of experienced changes in self- efficacy and emotional state. Results: Hypothesis 1 was supported: both self- efficacy and positive emotions were significantly increased by a video of peers sharing personal recovery stories relative to professionals presenting biomedical messages. Hypothesis 2 was partially supported: when comparing videos of recovery versus biomedical messages delivered by professionals, significant relative benefits were found for positive emotions, but not self- efficacy. Conclusions: This experimental investigation generated a pattern of findings broadly supportive of the assumed psychological benefits of the recovery paradigm for people with lived experiences of psychosis. Findings must be interpreted with caution given the limitations of the present design, but encourage further experimental research to directly test the interpersonal impacts of the recovery paradigm.\nK E Y W O R D S lived experience videos, mental health services, peer support, personal recovery, psychosis, self- efficacy\nPractitioner Points\n\u2022 Discussing psychosis with clients within a personal recovery framework as opposed to a traditional biomedical framework appears associated with more positive emotional responses. \u2022 Hearing peers with shared lived experience discuss recovery may also additionally lead to increased self- efficacy amongst people with psychosis.\nnloaded from https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/papt.12415 by L a T robe U niversity L ibrary, W iley O nline L ibrary on [23/11/2022].

A commonly cited definition of personal recovery is living a personally satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life, regardless of whether a person experiences ongoing symptoms or engages with services (Anthony, 1993; Mead & Copeland, 2000). In addition to self- determination as a central tenet of personal recovery, an influential meta- synthesis of service user accounts of their own recovery highlighted five enabling psychosocial processes (summarized by the CHIME acronym): developing and maintaining supportive relationships (connectedness); feeling motivated and believing in one's ability to enact change (hope); developing positive personal and social identities beyond a stigmatized \u2018passive patient\u2019 role (identity); living a subjectively meaningful and purposeful life (meaning); and accessing agency and autonomy in recovering one's life (empowerment) (Leamy et al., 2011).\nThis perspective emerged from the service user and survivor advocacy movement, in large part as a reaction to the biomedical and illness/disease models that have historically underpinned mental health service delivery (Deacon, 2013; Slade & Longden, 2015), and in which recovery conceptions are largely confined to symptom remission/cessation (Andreasen, 1985; Bellack, 2006; Galletly et al., 2016; Lehman, 1988). Service users and mental health advocates have argued that this perspective can contribute to pessimistic and stigmatized views of persisting mental illness, and can disempower service users by positioning them as passive recipients of care (Hughes, Hayward, et al., 2009; Mancini et al., 2005; Read et al., 2006). Indeed, some studies find that negative stereotype endorsement, or internalized stigma, can increase when mental health problems are linked with biogenetic causal explanations (Carter et al., 2018; Read et al., 2006).\nHowever, there remains a lack of empirical research on the impact of recovery- based perspectives on mental health service users when contrasted with traditionally dominant biomedical frameworks. The limited and inconclusive empirical literature on recovery- based services has primarily focused on the impact of complex interventions on broad measures of recovery (Lloyd- Evans et al., 2014; Meadows et al., 2019; Slade et al., 2015). In this context, a potentially important direction is a focused examination of specific processes associated with the ways in which mental health is discussed by people service users are likely to encounter during their service contact.\nIn the present study we chose to focus on self- efficacy, a view of oneself as capable and agentic (Bandura, 1977), and positive emotion: two variables that have strong negative associations with internalized stigma (Gumley et al., 2010; R\u00fcsch et al., 2009; Watson et al., 2007). Both are also robust predictors of recovery (Gumley, 2010; Morrison et al., 2013; Watson et al., 2007). Although these associations are now widely accepted, much of the underpinning research is correlational and qualitative, leaving open questions about whether assumed benefits for service users can be demonstrated using experimental methods.\nBeyond mental health professionals, peers (persons with lived experience of recovery) are increasingly involved in the delivery of mental health care, with their inclusion seen as aligned with recoveryoriented practice (Davidson et al., 2012). Indeed, extensive qualitative investigation of mental health service users has highlighted the value of peers in transforming illness- dominated identities, engendering hope and belonging, and modelling self- management of one's own recovery (Cook et al., 2010; Davidson et al., 2008; Hughes et al., 2009; Mead & Copeland, 2000). Limited research also identifies emotional state and self- efficacy as possible mechanisms through which peers may influence recovery (Hughes, Wood, et al., 2009; Mancini, 2007; Tew et al., 2011).\nThe present study brought two significant innovations to research into the proposed benefits of the recovery paradigm for people with lived experience of psychosis. First, we narrowed the focus by investigating the immediate impact of recovery versus biomedical messaging on psychological variables. As noted above, such messaging is presumed to be particularly effective when delivered by lived experience peers. Second, we moved beyond correlational and qualitative methods to create an experimental analogue of the experience of receiving ontological messages about serious mental illness. Specifically, we conceptualized the immediate individual impacts of recovery and biomedical paradigms as occurring through social interaction where professionals or peers discuss the meaning of mental health or the\nnloaded from https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/papt.12415 by L a T robe U niversity L ibrary, W iley O nline L ibrary on [23/11/2022].

Video recorded material was used to investigate the subjective impact of personal recovery versus biomedical messages on self- efficacy beliefs and emotional state of people with experience of psychosis. Two hypotheses were set: (1) personal recovery- oriented messages when presented by lived experience peers would generate immediate improvements in self- efficacy and positive emotions relative to biomedical messages presented by a professional and (2) recovery- oriented messages delivered by a professional would also generate immediate improvements in self- efficacy and positive emotions relative to biomedical messages delivered by a professional. The impacts of recovery messages delivered by peers versus professionals were also explored."

Participants were recruited from clinical and community mental health services via referral from practitioners, print and online advertisements, and publicity services \u2013 the latter efforts were designed to also attract eligible people who might not be engaged with services. The study was promoted as an investigation of the usefulness of different mental- health- related video resources and targeted anyone with lived experience of psychosis and/or anyone who worked with or otherwise knew anyone with lived experience of psychosis who might be interested. Further promotional steps were determined in consultation with services, and included meeting with client- facing workers to discuss the study, providing workers with scripts for discussions with potential participants, and attending client dropin sessions to promote the study to potential participants in person. Workers were also encouraged to refer people who may not have received or endorsed a psychosis- related diagnosis if they had been engaged with services for two or more years. Fifty- three participants (age M = 44.85, SD = 10.17) were deemed eligible and consented to take part. All participants reported both prior receipts of a formal diagnosis and engagement with specialist mental health services. Years since first contact with mental health services was variable (M = 20.13, SD = 10.18; range = 1\u2013 47 years). The majority of participants identified as men (52.8%), single (67.9%), and reported experiencing involuntary treatment (64.2%), low prior contact with recovered peers (64.2%), and trauma (90.6%).

All participants initially completed demographic questions as well as baseline measures of self- efficacy and recovery. Participants were then assigned to view the videos in random order via a concealed, computer- generated allocation sequence within Qualtrics (Figure 1). After viewing each video, participants completed measures of pre- to post- video emotion state change ratings, self- efficacy, and perceived presenter qualities. At the conclusion of the experiment, participants were able to watch a video of members of the research team explaining the specific aims of the study and the three video conditions.

Video duration (5 min) and production design was matched across videos. Prior to data collection, the videos were reviewed by peer and professional workers to ensure the content accurately reflected each perspective.\nPeers: Recovery\nThe peer recovery video was compiled from video material previously developed as part of the Self Management and Recovery Technology (SMART) research program in the State of Victoria, Australia (Arnold et al., 2019, 2020; Farhall et al., 2022; Thomas, Farhall, Foley, Leitan et al., 2016; Thomas, Farhall, Foley, Rossell et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2018, 2021). The video was edited to focus on key concepts relating to recovery. This included each of the concepts within the CHIME recovery framework; understanding mental health in terms of psychosocial factors such as trauma and adversity; and contact with recovered peers, self- advocacy, and choice in decision- making as potential facilitators of the recovery process. The possibilities for living well with mental health difficulties were a central theme.

Key themes included presenting mental illness as an illness like any other, the biogenetic aetiology of psychosis, practitioners having the expertise to help, assessment and diagnosis, early intervention and prevention, clinical treatment pathways and targets (e.g., medication, hospitalization, and family support to target symptom reduction and reduced admissions), the common course of serious mental illness, recovery as symptom remission, and recent advancements in biomedical research in psychosis.\nProfessionals: Recovery\nAlso developed for the current study, the final video involved the same mental health professionals discussing personal recovery. The content was elicited and edited to capture themes closely similar to the peer recovery videos. Although talking from a professional expertise perspective, speakers acknowledged that the basis for understanding recovery concepts was shared with those with lived experience (e.g., \u2018Through our work and from talking to people\u2026\u2019, \u2018When we talk to people about recovery, they often talk about\u2026\u2019)."

(Hergueta et al., 1998). Participants completed baseline and post- video measures including a number of demographic questions (i.e., gender, age, relationship/employment/housing status, and psychiatric service use history), and self- report scales.\nSelf- efficacy was measured on a modified, two- item version of the Self- Efficacy for Personal Recovery Scale (Villagonzalo et al., 2018): \u2018How confident are you that in the future you will be able to live a satisfying life alongside any mental health problems you may have?\u2019 and \u2018How confident are you that you can do things to manage any future mental health difficulties?\u2019 Both items are rated on a visual analogue scale from 0 (not confident I can do this at all ) to 100 (highly confident I can do this), which were averaged for the present purposes. The mean inter- item correlation for the two elements of SEPRS score at baseline was acceptable (\u03b1 = .71).\nThe impact of videos on the emotional state was measured immediately post- viewing on a purposebuilt self- report scale measuring change on six items tapping emotions relevant to people living with psychosis (Lysaker et al., 2012; R\u00fcsch et al., 2014; Schrank et al., 2012). Participants indicated on six visual analogue scales the extent to which they felt less (\u221250), through no change (0), to more (+50) of a particular state (\u2018hopeful\u2019, \u2018motivated\u2019, \u2018ashamed\u2019, \u2018alone\u2019, \u2018validated/understood\u2019, and \u2018positive about myself as a person\u2019) after viewing each video. Two reverse- scored items (\u2018ashamed\u2019 and \u2018alone\u2019) items were recoded before averaging across all six items to generate a score where higher values reflected a more positive emotional state. Internal consistency of the new 6- item scale across the three video conditions was adequate (\u03b1 = .83 to .93). To verify that there were no systematic differences in perceived presenter qualities (e.g., \u2018How knowledgeable were the presenters in the video you just viewed?\u2019) these were assessed as distinct items on a sliding scale from 0 (e.g., not at all knowledgeable) to 100 (e.g., very knowledgeable). Other assessed presenter qualities were \u2018believable\u2019, \u2018authentic\u2019, \u2018likeable\u2019, \u2018expert\u2019, and \u2018interesting\u2019."

The novel experimental design proved feasible and helps map out a direction for future sceptical research into recovery as a paradigm and interpersonal approach.\nOn balance, findings from this study are consistent with previous research that has explored the individual impacts of recovery service orientations and technologies using other methods, though any interpretations must necessarily be considered tentative and contingent in nature given the absence of a peer- delivered biomedical video condition in the present study. When compared with subjective reports after viewing professionals offer biomedical interpretations of their experiences, participants here reported parallel improvements in emotionality and self- efficacy immediately after watching lived experience presenters reflect on their own experiences navigating recovery. These findings align with previous trials (Mahlke et al., 2017; Van Gestel- Timmermans et al., 2012), correlational (McLeod et al., 2019), and qualitative (Mancini, 2007; Mancini et al., 2005) studies exploring similar questions.\nContrary to expectations, however, the dependent variables did not move in parallel when professionals delivered different messages: unlike the subjective improvements in emotional state that were reported after viewing professionals offer recovery as opposed to biomedical messages, participants' self- efficacy evaluations after viewing the two professionally- delivered videos did not differ. This finding diverges from current evidence presented across two recent systematic reviews: that people with experience of psychosis prefer psychosocial explanations of mental difficulties (Carter et al., 2017), and that individuals harbour greater confidence about their abilities to pursue recovery goals when engaging with service providers aligned with these perspectives (Thomas et al., 2018). One explanation may be that all of the experimental and observational studies included in these systematic reviews were conducted in clinical or other naturalistic settings and may therefore have more ecological validity than the current lab- based study. One alternative explanation for reconciling prior research with the present experimental data, that maintains fidelity to social learning (Bandura, 1977) and social comparison (Gerber et al., 2018) theories, could be that peers have a uniquely therapeutic role in developing a competent and efficacious self- concept in the context of serious mental illness. Positive emotionality may tap into the optimism of the messages and likeability for health professionals, similar to the mood- related outcomes that have been prioritized in previous related research (e.g., treatment engagement and satisfaction, internalized stigma) (Carter et al., 2018). It might be hypothesized that only those with lived experience are able to engender hope for oneself as an agent of recovery because perceptions of their \u2018similar- enoughness\u2019 protect against threatening and disempowering dynamics (see also State of Victoria, 2020, pp. 367\u2013 447).\nF I G U R E 2 Self- efficacy by condition\nnloaded from https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/papt.12415 by L a T robe U niversity L ibrary, W iley O nline L ibrary on [23/11/2022].

Although the findings here are provisional, they suggest that direct access to patient perspectives in mental health services may uniquely contribute to important recovery processes in the immediate term. The current study extends the extant literature through our preliminary attempt to isolate the paradigmatic components of perspective and messenger through our development and test of an experimental analogue of interpersonal encounters with peers and professionals, and by moving beyond global measures of recovery that are unable to contrast at the level of psychological process. Continued attention to these questions is important, not least because concerns about disempowering dynamics in mental health services prevail, as does the assumption that recovery- oriented encounters with professionals and clinicians are inherently beneficial for service users in self- managing and sustaining recovery beyond contact with services (Rennick- Egglestone et al., 2019).\nThe study had a number of limitations. First, the possibilities of a biased sample are apparent. Adoption of biomedically- anchored terminology in advertisement and inclusion criteria (e.g., \u2018lived experience of psychosis\u2019) may have excluded otherwise eligible individuals who use different terms to describe their relevant lived experience and/or reject such characterizations. This decision, alongside the administration of confirmatory diagnostic tools, may have also influenced participant responses via inadvertent positioning of the research team as proponents of biomedically derived models of meaningmaking. Also relevant to the possibilities of a biased sample, years since first contact with mental health services exceeded 10 years for the vast majority of the present sample and symptom severity data were not captured. Previous research has emphasized the role of time in personal recovery meaning and the potential influence of symptom status on this meaning (O'Keeffe et al., 2022). Ongoing research, motivated by our findings here, could also explore the nuances of these impacts amongst individuals experiencing different phases of wellness (e.g., individuals deemed clinically high risk) and durations of illness (e.g., individuals experiencing their first episode of psychosis compared with the years beyond).\nF I G U R E 3 Means and 95% confidence intervals of emotion state change ratings according to video condition\nnloaded from https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/papt.12415 by L a T robe U niversity L ibrary, W iley O nline L ibrary on [23/11/2022].

Third, the measurement of the two dependent variables was suboptimal. Future research should utilize validated measures of target constructs, and pre- post- change should be calculated on these dependent variables (in contrast to the retrospective change reports used here). Fourth, while analyses here demonstrated that video order did not confound the findings, there are clear advantages for the current research questions of a between- subjects design. Fifth, a stronger design would account for the effect of the presenter by adding a fourth condition (lived experience peers presenting biomedical messages) to consider potential interaction between presenter and message, as well as the possible transience of effects by following up beyond immediately after viewing each video. In the present study, data analytic concerns were weighed against participants' ability to sustain attention, as well as broader research participation pathways. Finally, the present study focused on only a small subset of the psychological benefits purported to arise from a recovery versus a biomedical framing of the challenges of psychosis. A future program of research in this space could more systematically test the CHIME components, and test whether a recovery- oriented interaction generates a change in not only beliefs and emotions (as suggested here), but also recovery behaviours, and the nature of any changes across time."
