    "abstractText": "Cancer progression is characterized by microenvironmental acidification. Tumor cells adapt to low environmental pH by activating acid-sensing trimeric ion channels of the DEG/ENaC family. The \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC heterotrimeric channel is a tumor-specific acid-sensing channel, and its targeting can be considered a new strategy for cancer therapy. Mambalgin-2 from the Dendroaspis polylepis venom inhibits the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC heterotrimer more effectively than the homotrimeric ASIC1a channel, initially proposed as the target of mambalgin-2. Although the molecular basis of such mambalgin selectivity remained unclear. Here, we built the models of the complexes of mambalgin-2 with the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC and ASIC1a channels, performed MD and predicted the difference in the binding modes. The importance of the \u2018head\u2019 loop region of mambalgin-2 for the interaction with the hetero-, but not with the homotrimeric channel was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology. A new mode of allosteric regulation of the ENaC channels by linking the thumb domain of the ASIC1a subunit with the palm domain of the \u03b3-ENaC subunit was proposed. The data obtained provide new insights into the regulation of various types of acid-sensing ion channels and the development of new strategies for cancer treatment.",

Three-finger protein mambalgin-2 from Dendroaspis polylepis venom inhibits the heterotrimeric \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC more effectively than the homotrimeric ASIC1a channel due to the additional contacts of the mambalgin-2 \u2018head\u2019 loop with the \u03b3-ENaC subunit. Targeting of the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC heterotrimer by mambalgin-2 may become perspective strategy for cancer treatment."

Due to high cell density and insufficient oxygenation, metabolic pathways are activated in tumor cells, leading to the\nToxins 2023, 15, 612. https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins15100612 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/toxins\nformation of acidic products that are removed from tumor cells to maintain a neutral intracellular pH [1\u20133]. This decreases the pH of the tumor microenvironment from ~7.4 to ~5.5\u20136.5 [4\u20138]. Tumor cells adapt to low environmental pH by activating pH sensors such as proton-sensitive cation channels of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family, which are trimers consisting of homologous subunits ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, ASIC4, and \u03b1\u2013\u03b4 ENaC [9\u201313]. The implication of these pH sensors in maintaining different (gastric, breast, hepatic, and glioblastoma) tumor cell growth is well documented [14\u201319]. The subunits that form these channels determine their pH sensitivity and pharmacological properties [20]. The most sensitive to a pH drop are the ASIC1a channels, which are expressed in the central nervous system and mediate synaptic plasticity and pain perception. Channels formed by ASIC1a subunits are expressed in non-neuronal cells, where they regulate gas exchange, the secretion of antibodies by lymphocytes, and the differentiation of keratinocytes in the skin [11]. ASIC1a channels are activated by a pH drop to ~6.4\u20136.6 and provide an entry of sodium ions into the cell. The inward sodium current regulates important cellular functions such as calcium homeostasis, volume and shape maintenance, activity of mitogenic signaling pathways based on activation of Wnt, ERK, or p38 MAP kinase, gene transcription (via \u03b2-catenin, the transcription factor NF\u03baB, or by regulation of the maturation of microRNA miR-350) [11,21]. The ENaC channels are also DEG/ENaC family members and are activated in tumor cells by protease cleavage [22]. Due to their similar structure as well as the fundamental similarity of selective filters, the ASIC and ENaC subunits can form heterocomplexes [23]. The interaction between the \u03b1-ENaC and ASIC1a subunits, resulting in a cationic current in alveolar cells, has been shown previously in a hybrid system [24]. The heterocomplex formed by the \u03b1-ENaC, ASIC1a, and \u03b3-ENaC subunits is characteristic of late-stage glioma cells but not of normal astrocytes [12,13] or lung adenocarcinoma cells [25]. Activated DEG/ENaC channels regulate the important signaling pathways that promote the proliferation and migration of tumor cells of different origins [16,26\u201331], thus targeting these channels is a perspective anti-tumor strategy. For example, inhibitors of the ASIC1a-containing channels\u2014mambalgin-2 (Mamb-2), found in the black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) venom [32],\u2014suppresses the growth of glioma, leukemia, melanoma, and lung adenocarcinoma cells [25,33\u201335]. Recently, it was demonstrated that Mamb-2 interacts with the tumor-specific heterotrimeric channel composed of the \u03b1-ENaC, ASIC1a, and \u03b3-ENaC subunits in melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma cells [25,35]. Moreover, Mamb-2 inhibits the heterotrimeric \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channel with a higher efficiency than the homotrimeric ASIC1a channel [25]. Although the molecular basis of such a toxin\u2019s selectivity remains unknown. Here, we studied the Mamb-2 interaction with the homotrimeric ASIC1a and heterotrimeric \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channels by MD simulations and revealed that the toxin forms additional ionic and hydrophobic contacts with the complementary \u03b3-ENaC(\u2212) subunit. Site-directed mutagenesis of the residues of Mamb-2 and the \u03b3-ENaC(\u2212) subunit from the interacting interface confirmed the discovered mode of the toxin/channel interaction. Our data provide new information about the regulation of acid-sensing ion channels and the demand for rational design of new anti-cancer drugs targeting the tumor-specific \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC heterotrimer."

Here, we aimed to reveal the molecular and structural basis for such a toxin\u2019s selectivity. To achieve that, we built the models for hetero- and homotrimeric channels in complex with Mamb-2 and ran molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for them in the membrane environment. To prove the initially postulated modeling hypothesis, we performed site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology."

            "text": "To build a model of the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channel, we considered the following points: (1) These channels are assembled counterclockwise; such assembly is provided by inter-subunit complementarity due to a network of hydrogen bonds [36]. Therefore, the \u03b1-ENaC, ASIC1a, and \u03b3-ENaC subunits in the heterochannel should also be arranged accordingly. (2) Mamb-2 inhibits currents through the homotrimeric ASIC1a and heterotrimeric \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channels upon a pH decrease [25]; thus, we proposed that Mamb-2 in complex with the heterotrimeric channel interacts at least with the ASIC1a subunit. (3) According to the cryo-EM structure of the homotrimeric ASIC1a channel with mambalgin-1 (Mamb-1), the closest Mamb-2 homologue (differing by a single substitution Y4F at the N-terminus), mambalgins interact mainly with the ASIC1a subunit located clockwise relative to Mamb-2 (view from the extracellular domain, in the direction of the channel pore), but not with the ASIC1a subunit located counterclockwise [37,38]. We labeled the subunit interacting with Mamb-2 in the hetero- and homocomplexes as the primary (+), and those located counterclockwise as the complementary (\u2212) ones. The models of the hetero- and homomeric channels were built in PyMOL (Figure 1) by superimposition of the individual subunit models on the experimental cryo-EM structure of the homomeric ASIC1a channel in complex with three Mamb-1 molecules whose positions were not altered (PDB code: 7CFT [37]). Structural models of the human ASIC1a (13-470), \u03b1-ENaC (50-593), and \u03b3-ENaC subunits (20-579) with Uniprot codes P78348, P37088, and P51170, respectively, were obtained from the AlphaFold database [39,40]. To avoid unwanted artifacts, the disordered N- and C-termini residues were removed from the structures (the final length of the subunits used in the work is shown in the brackets in the previous sentence). The Mamb-2 structure was obtained from the Mamb-1 structure (pdb code 7CFT) by the Y4F substitution using the mutagenesis tool in PyMOL. The models of the Mamb-2 complex with the heterotrimeric \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC and homotrimeric ASIC1a channels were built in a lipid bilayer composed of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) molecules similar to [41] using the CHARMM-GUI [42] Membrane Builder tool [43]. To represent N-glycans at sites 368/395 and 209/497 at the ASIC1a and \u03b3-ENac subunits, respectively, a classic pentasaccharide core composed of two N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and three Mannose (Man) residues was used. N-glycans were introduced into the built models of the channels using the Glycan Reader and Modeller tool [44]. The resulting models are shown in Figure 1; further details are provided in Methods. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for both modeled complexes were performed for 500 ns. In both models, Mamb-2 was bound at the adjacent subunits\u2019 interfaces: ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC or ASIC1a/ASIC1a (Figure 1). Due to the different number of toxin binding sites, one and three toxin molecules were bound to the heterotrimeric and homotrimeric channels, respectively. Similarly to the cryo-EM structure of ASIC1a/Mamb-1 (PDB code: 7CFT [37]), Mamb-2 interacted mainly with the thumb domain of the ASIC1a(+) subunits and with the lower palm domain of the complementary (\u2212) subunits without contacting the membrane (Figure 1). No considerable contacts of Mamb-2 with N-glycans were observed. The general position of Mamb-2 relative to the subunits and cell membrane in both complexes, as well as the stability of the complexes, did not change during MD.\nToxins 2023, 15, 612 4 of 17Toxins\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Models\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 complexes\u00a0 of\u00a0 Mamb-2\u00a0 with\u00a0 ASIC1\u00a0 homotrimer\u00a0 (a,b)\u00a0 and\u00a0 \u03b1-\nENaC/ASIC1/\u03b3-ENaC\u00a0heterotrimer\u00a0(c,d):\u00a0side\u00a0(a,c)\u00a0and\u00a0top\u00a0(b,d)\u00a0views\u00a0are\u00a0shown.\u00a0Both\u00a0models\u00a0are\u00a0\nimmersed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0phospholipid\u00a0 bilayer\u00a0 and\u00a0 solvated\u00a0 to\u00a0perform\u00a0MD\u00a0 calculations;\u00a0 the\u00a0presented\u00a0\nstructures\u00a0result\u00a0from\u00a0500\u00a0ns\u00a0MD.\u00a0"

The influence of these mutations on the activity of Mamb-2 at the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channel was analyzed in electrophysiological experiments in X. laevis oocytes, which express wild-type (WT) and mutant variants of the channel.

The curves for R90A and K91A channel mutants moved right regarding the curve for the WT channel, demonstrating a significant increase in IC50 from ~130 nM of the WT heterotrimeric channel to ~250 nM and 190 nM, respectively. Simultaneously, the changes in the bottom of the curves (the value of maximal inhibitory response) for the R90A and K91A mutants of the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channel were observed, pointing to possible allosteric regulation by Mamb-2."

Mutations did not alter the overall Mamb-2 structure, according to 1D 1H-NMR analysis. The NMR spectra of the mutants were very similar to the spectrum of WT Mamb-2, suggesting that mutant toxins\u2019 structures did not change (Figure S2). We found that no mutant toxins were able to fully inhibit the currents through the WT \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channel at the concentration of 370 nM, while WT Mamb-2 (Figure 5a). For each Mamb-2 mutant, we obtained \u201cdose\u2013response\u201d curves and compared them to the curve of the WT toxin. It appeared that every single mutation resulted in significantly diminished toxin activity at the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC heterochannel (Figure 5b). IC50 for the mutants H13A, R14A, D15A, and R14A/D15A became ~350, 200, 230, and 220 nM, respectively, while the IC50 of WT Mamb-2 was found to be ~130 nM. Notably, the diminished activity of the double mutant R14A/D15A was obvious but didn\u2019t reach statistical significance (Table 3). No significant changes in the bottom of the curves for any of the Mamb-2 mutants were revealed (Table 3).\nToxins\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0

In contrast to the situation with the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channel, the double mutation R14A/D15A and single mutation H13A resulted in the increased toxin\u2019s activity at the ASIC1a channel with significantly enhanced maximal inhibitory response, although without significant change in IC50 (Figure 6a,b, Table 4). Thus, Mamb-2 WT and its mutants H13A, R14A, and D15A demonstrated only partial inhibitory activity at the ASIC1a channel even at high concentrations (10 \u00b5M), while the double mutation R14A/D15A

            "text": "Acid-sensing trimeric ion channels of the DEG/ENaC family are activated by external acidification (pH drop) and are important regulators of different essential processes such as mechanosensitivity, pain perception, synaptic plasticity, anxiety response, cancer progression, etc., [10,46]. The composition of the channel\u2019s trimers determines its sensitivity to the pH drop or other physiological stimuli and shapes the adequate response to an external signal [11]. The formation of channels with altered composition and response patterns in comparison to physiologically normal channels may serve as a mechanism of adaptation of the cells to different pathological conditions. For example, during cancer progression, the formation of the tumor-specific heterotrimeric \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channels was shown [12,13]. The activation of such channels may drive the adaptation of tumor cells to external acidification and activate different mitogenic signaling pathways [10]. Thus, targeting such cancer-specific heterotrimeric channels may be a perspective strategy for the treatment of different oncopathologies. Previously, it was shown that mambalgin-2, the three-finger protein (TFP, [47]) from the Mamba venom initially described as the inhibitor of the ASIC1a channels [48], interacts with the heterotrimeric \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channels in various cancer cells, and this interaction results in control of the homeostasis of cancer cells [25,35]. Moreover, mambalgin-2 inhibits currents evoked by the pH drop at the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channels with higher efficiency than at the ASIC1a channels (Tables 3 and 4, and [25]). Here, we aimed to elucidate the molecular basis underlying the mambalgin-2 selectivity regarding the heterotrimeric \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channels. We performed computer modeling of the interaction of mambalgin-2 with two types of channels: heterotrimeric \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC and homotrimeric ASIC1a. We found that the toxin forms a similar interaction pattern with the primary ASIC1a(+) subunit in both cases, mostly by the central (II) loop (Figure 2), which agrees well with the previous mutagenesis data [48]. However, the interaction mode of the toxin with the complementary (\u2212) subunits was different. Almost all residues forming the interaction interface Mamb2/\u03b3-ENaC(\u2212) in complex with the heterotrimeric channel were located in the \u2018head\u2019 of the toxin\u2019s molecule (Figure 3a). The \u2018head\u2019 region of Mamb-2 formed the set of hydrophobic and ionic contacts with the \u03b3-ENaC(\u2212) subunit, while the number of the \u2018head\u2019 contacts with the ASIC1a(\u2212) subunit in complex with the homotrimeric channel was obviously lower (Figure 3a,b and Table 1, Tables S1 and S2). Site-directed mutagenesis with the subsequent electrophysiological studies confirmed the importance of the \u2018head\u2019 residues for the toxin\u2019s interaction just with the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channels, but not with the ASIC1a channels. Thus, the stronger activity of Mamb-2 at the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channels can be explained by the existence of additional contacts of the toxin\u2019s \u2018head\u2019 with the complementary \u03b3-ENaC(\u2212) subunit.\nThe main functional epitopes of TFPs are located in the disordered loops I-III [49\u201352]. The \u2018Head\u2019 region of TFPs also has a disordered structure (Figure 3c) and can be considered an auxiliary binding site regulating TFP\u2019s interaction with other supplementary partners necessary for the function of the \u2018main\u2019 receptor. These supplementary partners can be either the cell membrane surrounding the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor [53,54] or other receptors, for example, receptor-tyrosine kinases in the case of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the human SLURP-1 protein in cancer cells [51]. Here, on the example of mambalgin-2, we revealed an additional \u2018application\u2019 of the \u2018head\u2019 region of TFPs: the regulation of the interaction selectivity between various types of acid-sensing channels. Probably, the \u2018head\u2019 moiety can be used for transplanting one or another activity to TFPs and to drug design with directed specificity. Surprisingly, wild-type Mamb-2 fully inhibited the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channels and only partially inhibited the ASIC1a ones (Figures 4 and 5), pointing to possible allosteric modulation of the homotrimeric channel by the toxin. Mutations R90A and K91A of the heterotrimeric channel led to increased IC50 (from 130 \u00b1 20 to 250 \u00b1 60 and 190 \u00b1 30 nM, respectively) and the diminished maximal inhibitory activity of Mamb-2 (from 100% to ~70%, Figure 4, Table 2), indicating the appearance of the allosteric effects with switching of the pharmacology of the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channel to the properties of the homotrimeric ASIC1a channel. On the other hand, the introduction of the double mutation R14A/D15A into the Mamb-2 molecule also changed the mode of the toxin interaction with the homotrimeric channel in the direction of the heterotrimeric channel (increase in the maximal inhibitory activity of Mamb-2 from ~60% to ~85% with slight decrease in IC50, Figure 6, Table 4). Thus, the changes in the binding interface both from the toxin\u2019s and channel\u2019s sides could shift the pharmacology of heterotrimeric and homotrimeric acid-sensing channels to each other. Previously, indirect data indicating that Mamb-2 inhibits and stabilizes the desensitization state of the channels containing the ASIC1a subunit in cancer cells were obtained [33,34]. Here, we built the models of the complexes of Mamb-2 with the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC and ASIC1a channels, and these complexes were stable at MD during the 500 ns trajectory. According to these models, Mamb-2 interacts with the \u03b14 and \u03b15 helices of the thumb domain of the primary ASIC1a(+) subunit (Figure 1), which has an allosteric effect on the acid (proton-binding) pocket, keeping it in an expanded state with a simultaneously closed ion channel [38]. This channel\u2019s state is characterized by a noticeable weakening of pH-sensing and a decrease in the current through the channel [38], which is in line with our present data (Figures 4\u20136). On the other hand, Mamb-2 interacts with the residues from the \u03b21-\u03b22 linker of the palm domain of the complementary (\u2212) subunits (F89, R90, K91 in the case of the \u03b3-ENaC (\u2212) subunit and V80, A81, A82, and S83 in the case of ASIC1a (\u2212) subunit). Previously, in the example of the homotrimeric ASIC1a channel, the important role of reorientation of the \u03b21-\u03b22 linker in switching the channel from the low-pH open state to the low-pH desensitized state was shown [55]. This means that the interaction of Mamb-2 with the \u03b21-\u03b22 linker can stabilize either the open or desensitized states of the channels. Keeping in mind that no activation effect from Mamb-2 was observed (Figures 4\u20136), this indicates that the toxin stabilizes the desensitization state of the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC and ASIC1a channels. The function of the \u03b1-ENaC/\u03b2-ENaC/\u03b3-ENaC channels can be regulated by different molecules and factors such as extracellular Na+, Cl\u2212, H+, metals, proteases, amiloride, and sheer stress [56]. Presently, several extracellular regulatory sites in the heterotrimeric channel were described: the extracellular sites located at the finger domains of the \u03b1ENaC and \u03b3-ENaC subunits, which can affect Na+ self-inhibition [22,57], and the amiloride binding pore domain [58]. Moreover, cross-linking of the palm domains of \u03b1-ENaC or \u03b2-ENaC with the thumb domains of \u03b3-ENaC or \u03b1-ENaC, respectively, resulted in strong inhibition of the \u03b1-ENaC/\u03b2-ENaC/\u03b3-ENaC channel activity [56]. Here, we substituted the \u03b2-ENaC subunit with the ASIC1a subunit and showed that linking the thumb domain of ASIC1a with the palm domain of \u03b3-ENaC within the \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC channel by\nthe Mamb-2 molecule (Figure 3a) also resulted in the channel inhibition (Figure 4). Thus, a new mode of regulation of the heterotrimeric ASIC1a/ENaC channels was revealed."

Molecular Dynamics Calculations\nMD trajectories for the heterotrimeric \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC and homotrimeric ASIC1a channels in complex with Mamb-2 were calculated in the all-atom CHARMM36m forcefield [59] and TIP3P water model via GROMACS [60]. For a more accurate description of \u03c0-cation interactions, an additional set of CHARMM36-WYF parameters [61] was used. MD calculations included the following stages: energy minimization (steepest descent algorithm), NVT relaxation (250 ps), NPT relaxation with C-rescale barostat [62] (2000 ps), and production MD (500 ns). The MD calculations for an equilibrated system were performed in an NPT ensemble at a temperature of 310 K with a V-rescale thermostat [63] and a Parinello-Raman barostat [64] with a time step of 2 fs. No position restraints were applied to any molecules during the production MD phase, so the structures of the proteins and N-glycans were allowed to relax and change.\n5.1.2. Contacts Analysis\nFor analysis of intermolecular contacts between Mamb-2 and the heterotrimeric \u03b1ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC and homotrimeric ASIC1a channels, we utilized our in-house IMPULSE software package (cont_stat.js procedure) [65]. Ionic, ion-dipole, \u03c0-cationic, staking interactions, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic contacts were analyzed. Hydrophobic contacts were determined according to the concept of molecular hydrophobic potential (MHP) [66]. In the case of the homotrimeric ASIC1a channel data, the Mamb-2 interaction lifetime was averaged between three toxin molecules. A complete list of all found contacts is available in Tables S1 and S2 for the heteroand homotrimer channels, respectively. The values in the tables are the relative lifetimes of interactions between the Mamb-2 and channels\u2019 primary (+) and complementary (\u2212) subunit residues; one can analyze them using the sorting and filtering tools of the table processing program. Relative lifetime is the fraction of MD time when the contact is observed, from absence (0) to presence throughout the whole trajectory (1). Using the obtained data on the contacts lifetimes from the Impulse software package, we built maps of the interaction intensity of Mamb-2 with the primary ASIC1a(+) subunit in the ASIC1a(+)/ASIC1a(+) and ASIC1a(+)/\u03b3-ENaC(\u2212) interfaces in the homotrimeric and heterotrimeric channels, respectively. To do that, we performed a summation of all the interaction lifetimes of different types of contacts between each residue of Mamb-2 and each residue of ASIC1a(+) in both complexes. The data on the contacts lifetime used for summation are represented in Tables S1 and S2, as are the initial csv files obtained from the Impulse software package after MD trajectory analysis. The summation of lifetimes was performed using our own Python script. The following types of contacts lifetimes were summarized: ionic bridges, hydrogen bonds, \u03c0-cation, stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. The resulting heatmaps were prepared via Matplotlib and Seaborn library\nutilities. Developed scripts for data analysis and contacts maps preparation are available at the Zenodo repository. The following software versions were used: GROMACS 2022.4; CHARMM-GUI 3.8; IMPULSE 21.09; and PyMOL 2.5.5."

Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were done using the TEC-03X amplifier (npi electronic GmbH, Tamm, Germany) at a holding potential of \u221250 mV. The output signal was filtered at 20 Hz by a four-pole Bessel filter and digitized at 1 kHz using the National Instruments BNC-6251 card, controlled by WinWCP 5.2.7. Microelectrodes were fabricated with 1.0\u20131.5 MOhm resistance and filled with 3 M KCl. The external perfusion solution for oocytes was ND-96 medium (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) for both ASIC1a and \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC, and it was fed to a perfusion chamber (volume ~50 \u00b5L) using a gravity-flow system at speed 2.5 mL/min. The currents were stimulated by a pH drop to 5.0 for both ASIC1a and \u03b1-ENaC/ASIC1a/\u03b3-ENaC. The pH drop was performed by fast perfusion solution exchange for 0.1 s to ND-96 medium with 10 mM MES instead of HEPES, adjusted to the target pH, and kept for 7 s; after that, the solution was exchanged to ND-96 with a pH of 7.4. The treatment of oocytes with the Mamb-2-containing solution was performed by solution exchange in the recording chamber for 15 s before the current stimulation. Lyophilized Mamb-2 was dissolved in 100% DMSO in a 10-mM stock solution and then diluted to a target concentration with ND-96 medium before the experiment. Amiloride (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in ND-96 medium (pH 7.4) from the 500-mM stock in 100% DMSO. The DMSO concentration in the recording solution did not exceed 1%. The exchange of extracellular solutions was performed using a computer-controlled valve system. Mamb-2 concentrations for the dose\u2013response curves were 0\u201310 \u00b5M. Each oocyte was tested with all concentrations of Mamb-2. Dose\u2013response curves were fitted with the Hill equation: Y = 1/(1 + 10((LogIC50 \u2212 X)\u00d7nH)), where Y is the normalized current amplitude (independent normalization for each oocyte), X is the lg of concentration of the ligand concentration, and nH is the Hill coefficient (slope factor). Fit parameters were compared with one-way ANOVA and Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test; for IC50, the comparison of LogIC50 was done instead of IC50 itself."
