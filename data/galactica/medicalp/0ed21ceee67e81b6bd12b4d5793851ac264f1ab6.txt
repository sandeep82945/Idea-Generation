Migraine is a prevalent disease associated with high levels of disability and is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. This systematic literature review aimed to identify the types of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies that community-dwelling adults report using to manage migraine. A systematic literature review of relevant databases, grey literature, websites, and journals was conducted from 1 January 1989 to 21 December 2021. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were completed independently by multiple reviewers. Data were extracted on migraine management strategies and categorized as opioid and non-opioid medications and medical, physical, psychological, or self-initiated strategies. A total of 20 studies were included. The sample sizes ranged from 138 to 46,941, with a mean age of 34.7 to 79.9 years. The data were typically collected using self-administered questionnaires (nine studies), interviews (five studies), online surveys (three studies), paper-based surveys (two studies), and a retrospective database (one study). Community-dwelling adults with migraine reported they primarily used medications, specifically triptans (range 9–73%) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (range 13–85%) to manage migraine. Except for medical strategies, the use of other non-pharmacological strategies was low. Common non-pharmacological strategies included consulting physicians (range 14–79%) and heat or cold therapy (35%). 1. conclusions The primary management strategy for migraine was the use of triptans, ergotamine, and NSAID, while the use of opioids was not that high, both consistent with practice guidelines for the management of migraine.
