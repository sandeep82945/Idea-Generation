    "abstractText": "The oriental fruit fly is a polyphagous and highly invasive economically important pest in the world. We proposed the hypothesis that radiation treatment influence RNA expression in the larvae and leads to emergence failure. Therefore, transcriptome analyses of third-instar larvae of B. dorsalis ionizing, irradiated with 60Co-\u03b3 at 116Gy, were conducted and compared with the controls; a total of 608 DEGs were identified, including 348 up-regulated genes and 260 down-regulated ones. In addition, 130 SNPs in 125 unigenes were identified. For the DEGs, the most significantly enriched GO item was hemolymph coagulation, and some of the enriched pathways were involved in digestive processes. The subsequent validation experiment confirmed the differential expression of six genes, including sqd, ENPEP, Jhe, mth, Notch, and Ugt. Additionally, the 3401:G->A SNP in the Notch gene was also successfully validated. According to previous research, this was the first comparative transcriptome study to discover the candidate genes involved in insect molt to pupae. These results not only deepen our understanding of the emerging mechanism of B. dorsalis but also provide new insights into the research of biomarkers for quarantine insect treatment with the appropriate dose of radiation.",

            "text": "The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera: Tephritidae), belongs to the B. dorsalis complex and is a severe insect pest of several fruits and vegetables all around the world [1]. It was first detected in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in costal parts of Kenya in 2003 and\nInsects 2022, 13, 1017. https://doi.org/10.3390/insects13111017 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/insects\nInsects 2022, 13, 1017 2 of 15\nbecame widely spread and established successfully across the world [2]. It originates in tropic and sub-tropic regions and is now widespread in China, Southeast Asia, India, and Oceania. Moreover, it has also been found in the Pacific islands, including the Hawaiian Islands, French Polynesia, and Northern Marianas [3]. As an invasive agricultural pest, it causes severe losses to over 250 commercially important plants, including bananas, citrus, star fruit, guava, mango, and eggplants [4]. The female insects oviposit inside the fruit, where the larvae feed until pupation. This usually causes fruit damage and fruit drop [5,6]. Since B. dorsalis is polyphagous and highly invasive, quarantine areas for B. dorsalis have been declared in many areas [7]. Currently, strict phytosanitary treatments are used to prevent the introduction, and/or spread, of exotic tephritidae pests such as B. dorsalis. Chemical fumigants, such as ethylene dibromide (EDB) were first widely used as a pesticide [8]. However, in the late 1980s, EDB was found to be linked to cancer, and in 1984 a ban by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USA, removed EDB from the chemical register for use as an insecticide [9]. Irradiation is an alternative process to chemical fumigation that is easy to apply, quick, and generally safe. Moreover, significant efforts have been made to determine the suitable radiation dose for quarantine treatment. Tephritidae quarantine treatments generally target eggs and larvae because the larvae leave the fruit to pupate in the soil [10]. In addition, the third instar (the last stage of larva) is the most radio-resistant insect stage [11]. Other third-instar tephritid fruit fly larvae have been employed for radiotolerance and substantiative studies, including B. dorsalis [12\u201315], Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann [13,15], Zeugodacus cucurbitae Coquillett [13,16], and Z. tau Walker [17]. The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is now evaluating prospective standards for the irradiation treatment of Z. tau, B. dorsalis, and the genus Anastrepha, in order to develop international standards as an appendix to ISPM No. 28 [18] and 210, 225, and 250 Gy, where quarantine doses are currently approved for these insects, respectively. Moreover, for tephritid fruit flies and other insects, the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) approved generic radiation treatment doses of 150 Gy and 400 Gy in 2006, respectively [19\u201321], although the adult and pupae of Lepidoptera may require higher doses. In addition, to encourage global usage irradiation of up to 150 Gy would provide quarantine security against all fruit fly species of the family Tephritidae [22]. To prevent the subsequent infection and re-infestation, the fresh commodities would be required to be sterilized with arthropod-proof packaging [16]. Phytosanitary methods, such as temperature, fumigation, and irradiation treatments are currently employed for exporting commodities. The usage of phytosanitary irradiation (PI) treatment has expanded dramatically, with a global fresh goods volume of around 30,000 tons in 2017 [12,23]. Recently, the emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided an opportunity for researchers to efficiently obtain massive quantities of sequence data. Since the transcriptome of B. dorsalis was built by Illumina, the sequencing and transcriptome analyses of B. dorsalis focused on genes involved in reproduction, development, and insecticide resistance have also been performed. The results of previous studies suggested that Illumina transcriptome analysis is a reliable and precise way to study genomic characteristics [24]. Up to now, the comprehensive identification of biochemical markers that can be used in quarantine stations to determine whether the encountering living oriental fruit flies have received an appropriate dose of radiation remains unavailable [25]. In the present study, we present the results from the sequencing and assembly of the transcriptome of two groups (with and without the appropriate dose of radiation with three biological replicates) of the third-instar larvae of B. dorsalis. The readings were first assembled through a de novo genome assembly. DEGs were detected and functionally annotated, and the gene expression patterns for the selected DEGs were validated by qRT-PCR. Irradiated-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or control-specific SNPs shared by all samples in the group were also identified, and some of them were validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. This transcriptome is a useful resource for the identification of potentially useful biochemical markers that can be used in quarantine.\nInsects 2022, 13, 1017 3 of 15\nFurthermore, our data will provide insights into the molecular mechanisms putatively related to the irradiation response of B. dorsalis."

Three biological replicates were used for each group: CK (Ck1A, Ck2A, and CK3A) and R (R1A, R2A, and R3A). The Fricke system was employed for both the reference standard and routine dosimetry [27]. This dosimetry system was constructed in accordance with ASTM E1026-13 [27] and ISO/ASTM 51261 [27], and the measured uncertainty value was computed in accordance with ISO/ASTM 51707 [28].

The remaining clean reads were used for transcriptome de novo assembly using the Trinity de novo RNAseq assembly pipeline (Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly) with k-mer sizes set at 25. The output of the Trinity pipeline is a fasta formatted file containing full-length transcripts, erroneous contigs, partial transcript fragments, and non-coding RNA molecules. By using RSEM (RNA-Seq by expectation maximization) software1.2.0 [30], these sequences were then filtered to identify contigs containing full or near full-length transcripts or likely coding regions and isoforms that were represented at a minimum level based on the read abundance. The resulting de novo transcripts (unigenes) were screened against protein databases, such as NR, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, and COG using BLASTX with a cut-off E value of 10\u22125. For each transcript, the best aligning result was used to determine the sequence direction. If different databases gave conflicting results, a priority order of GenBank nonredundant (NR), Swiss-Prot, KEGG, and COG was followed. If a unigene did not map to any of the entries in the above databases, the software ESTScan [31] was introduced to predict its coding regions and sequence direction.\nInsects 2022, 13, 1017 4 of 15"

Hemolymph coagulation was the most significantly enriched GO item (p = 4.10 \u00d7 10\u221225), followed by hemostasis (p = 4.83 \u00d7 10\u221222), coagulation (p = 4.83 \u00d7 10\u221222), and the regulation of body fluid levels (p = 1.85 \u00d7 10\u221221). All of the DEGs were also mapped to the KEGG database and compared with the whole transcriptome background. Among all of the genes with KEGG annotation, a total of 380 DEGs were found between the two groups. A total of 32 pathways were notably enriched (Table 3). The most significant pathway was the renin-angiotensin system (p = 5.42 \u00d7 10\u221210), followed by protein digestion and absorption (p = 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22128) and pancreatic secretion (p = 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22128). Most of the enriched pathways (18/32) were metabolic pathways, such as porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, retinol metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and insect hormone biosynthesis.\nInsects 2022, 13, 1017 8 of 15\nInsects 2022, 13, 1017 9 of 15\nInsects 2022, 13, 1017 10 of 15"

Discussion Irradiation, temperature, and fumigation are currently the most popular phytosanitary treatment techniques used for the disinfestation of postharvest fruit flies in fruits and vegetables [39]. Irradiation has gained popularity as a phytosanitary treatment in the last decade for the eradication of arthropods, ornamentals, and preserved products [40]. Irradiation can cause sub-lethal molecular or biochemical changes, triggering a cascade of physiological changes. In order to eliminate insect pests, gamma radiation is frequently used as a potentially better alternative to toxic fumigants [41]. In this study, with transcriptome sequencing data from two groups (the control and treatment groups with their three biological replicates), we selected molecular markers for the identification of insects that had been treated with gamma irradiation. Previous researchers demonstrated that gamma radiation is environmentally beneficial, with no noticeable environmental adverse effects. Moreover, gamma irradiation prevents the reproduction of several stored grain pest species [42,43]. Our deep sequencing strategy (over 5 G of data for each sample) generated a transcriptome assembly with 50,268 unigenes (a mean length of 781 bp). A total of 20.78% of the unigenes were more than 1000 bp. The previously reported B. dorsalis transcriptome, which was also sequenced on the Illumina platform, generated 49,804 unigenes with a mean size of 456 bp, and less than 10% of the unigenes were over 1000 bp. With 454-pyrosequencing, Zheng et al. [44] generated a B. dorsalis transcriptome with 48,876 unigenes (mean size of 750 bp), and about 18.4% of the unigenes were over 1000 bp. Therefore, compared with the previously reported B. dorsalis transcriptome assembly, we generated more detailed data that facilitated our subsequent analysis. The functional annotation results of the unigenes were generally consistent with the previous transcriptome: the majority of the unigenes had a strong homology with Drosophila; the general function category was the top COG category, and the KEGG metabolic pathways contained the most unigenes. A total of 608 significantly differentially expressed unigenes between the two groups may be attributed to their response to \u03b3 irradiation. GO item enrichment analyses revealed that the most significantly enriched GO item was hemolymph coagulation, which is one of the first responses to injury in insects. KEGG pathway analyses of these genes revealed that some of the pathways were involved in digestive processes, such as protein digestion"

GO item enrichment analyses revealed that the most significantly enriched GO item was hemolymph coagulation, which is one of the first responses to injury in insects. KEGG pathway analyses of these genes revealed that some of the pathways were involved in digestive processes, such as protein digestion and absorption and pancreatic secretion. This observation is consistent with the well-established irradiation effects on digestive physiology in other insect pests. The differential expressions of eight unigenes were further confirmed by qRT-PCR. As shown in Table 4 (Figure 4), the squid gene sqd was downregulated in irradiated samples while ENPEP, Jhe, mth, Notch, and Ugt were highly expressed. The downregulation of sqd may contribute to the failure of emergence in irradiated samples since the initial organization of the Drosophila dorsoventral axis depends on the proteins encoded by sqd. Both ENPEP and Ugt are involved in metabolic pathways, and their up-regulation may be considered the results of the \u03b3 irradiation stress reaction. Juvenile hormone esterase (Jhe) plays an important role in the regulation of the juvenile hormone (JH). In lepidopteran hemolymph,\nInsects 2022, 13, 1017 13 of 15\ndecreased JH titers are positively correlated with increased JHE abundance [45]. The high expression of Jhe here may result in the low titers of JH, which are associated with diapause. For example, Monarch adult diapause is instituted by a deficiency in JH production [46]. Therefore, the upregulation of Jhe may contribute to the diapauses of our \u03b3 irradiated samples. Individuals with a mutated mth displayed an approximately 35 percent increase in their average lifespan and showed significant resistance to oxidative stress, starvation, and heat stress. We also detected a heterozygous SNP in this gene in the \u03b3 irradiated samples, which might be caused by the stress response. Notch (N) signaling is involved in establishing the correct width of various wing veins [47], and the up-regulation of Notch here may also contribute to the failure of emergence in the irradiated samples since the gain of function in Notch showed thinner and incomplete wing veins. In addition to the confirmed up-regulation of Notch, an SNP in this gene was also validated by the Sanger sequencing. It is highly possible that the confirmed SNP was induced by the irradiation treatment. Since the SNP was validated six times in three biological and three technical replicates of the samples, it could be used as DNA markers in quarantine. Other SNPs identified in this study are also useful sources for further studies on selecting DNA markers in quarantine."
