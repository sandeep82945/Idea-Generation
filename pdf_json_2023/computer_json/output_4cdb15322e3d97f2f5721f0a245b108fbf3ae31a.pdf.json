    "abstractText": "In this work, using the noncommutative integration method of linear differential equations, we obtain a complete set of solutions to the Schrodinger equation for a quantum asymmetric top in Euler angles. It is shown that the noncommutative reduction of the Schrodinger equation leads to the Lame equation. The resulting set of solutions is determined by the Lame polynomials in a complex parameter, which is related to the geometry of the orbits of the coadjoint representation of the rotation group. The spectrum of an asymmetric top is obtained from the condition that the solutions are invariant with respect to a special irreducible \u03bb-representation of the rotation group.",

            "text": "The problem of the asymmetric top in quantum mechanics is a standard one, dealt with by a number of authors [1\u20138]. The quantum asymmetric top has many applications, ranging from quantum information [9] to high-resolution spectroscopy [10], especially in the fields of molecular [11,12] and nuclear [13\u201315] physics. It should be noted that the problem of scalar waves in a frozen Mixmaster universe is mathematically identical to that of the asymmetric top, except that half-integral angular momenta [16\u201318]. The stationary Schrodinger equation for a quantum asymmetric top does not allow the separation of variables in the general case [1] because the necessary and sufficient conditions for the theorem on the separation of variables are not satisfied [19]. However, for wave functions that depend on only two variables, the equation admits a separation of variables in an elliptic coordinate system, which makes it possible to find the spectrum of an asymmetric top [20]. In this case, the eigenfunctions in the standard approach are sought in the form of a series of Wigner D-functions. In this paper, to integrate the Schrodinger equation for a quantum asymmetric top, the noncommutative integration method of linear differential equations [21\u201324] is used, which, unlike the method of separation of variables, allows us to reduce to an ordinary differential equation in the general case. Note that [25] used this method to study the semiclassical spectrum of an asymmetric top. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the basic concepts from the quantum theory of an asymmetric top and describe it in terms of the rotation group SO(3). Section 3 is devoted to finding a complete set of solutions to the Schrodinger equation using the noncommutative integration method. In Section 4, we study the connection between the Wigner D-function and a special irreducible representation (irreps) of the group SO(3), from which the completeness of the obtained set of solutions follows. In the last Section 5, we summarize and discuss the main results. Some useful technical details are placed in the Appendix A.\nHere, we are using the natural system of units c = h\u0304 = 1.\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 503. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15020503 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry"

The quantum spherical top corresponds to the case A = B = C and the quantum symmetrical top to the case A = B \u0338= C. A top is called an asymmetric top if A \u0338= B \u0338= C.\nThe square of the total angular momentum operator L\u03022 = L\u030221 + L\u0302 2 2 + L\u0302 2 3 commutes\nwith the Hamiltonian H\u0302, [L\u03022, H\u0302] = 0. Let us describe quantum top problem in terms of rotation group SO(3). We describe the orientation of the top by Euler angles g = (\u03d5, \u03b8, \u03c8), \u03d5 \u2208 [0; 2\u03c0), \u03b8 \u2208 [0; \u03c0), \u03c8 \u2208 [0; 2\u03c0), referred to as axes fixed in space. We note that Euler angles parameterize the group element g \u2208 SO(3) (see Appendix A). Projections of the angular momentum operator L\u0302 with respect to the axes of the body-fixed reference frame are\nL\u03021 = i\u03be1, L\u03022 = i\u03be2, L\u03023 = i\u03be3, [L\u03021, L\u03022] = \u2212iL\u03023,\nwhere \u03bea are left-invariant vector fields (A2) (see Ref. [16]). Operators for the components of angular momentum along the axes fixed in space (space-fixed reference frame) are given by:\nJ\u0302x = i\u03b71, J\u0302y = i\u03b72, J\u0302z = i\u03b73, [ J\u0302x, J\u0302y] = \u2212i J\u0302z,\nwhere \u03b7a are right-invariant vector fields (A3). The square of the total angular momentum operator is the Casimir operator of the SO(3) group and the same in both reference frames:\nL\u03022 = K(\u2212i\u03be) = K(i\u03b7) = \u2212 1 sin2 \u03b8\n( \u22022\n\u2202\u03c82 +\n\u22022\n\u2202\u03d52 \u2212 2 cos \u03b8 \u2202\n2\n\u2202\u03d5\u2202\u03c8\n) \u2212 \u2202 2\n\u2202\u03b82 \u2212 cot \u03b8 \u2202 \u2202\u03b8 ,\nwhere K( f ) = f 21 + f 2 2 + f 2 3 . There are three mutually commuting operators X ={L\u03023, J\u03023, L\u03022}. We denote the common eigenfunctions of the set as |j, m, n\u27e9,\nL\u03022|j, m, n\u27e9 = j(j + 1)|j, m, n\u27e9, j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , \u2212L\u03023|j, m, n\u27e9 = n|j, m, n\u27e9, n = \u2212j, . . . , j,\nJ\u0302z|j, m, n\u27e9 = m|j, m, n\u27e9, (2)\nThey correspond to states with a given angular momentum j and its z-projection n, with respect to the axes of the body-fixed reference frame and z-projection m, with respect to the space-fixed reference frame. An explicit form of the states |j, m, n\u27e9 is given by the Wigner D-functions that are matrix elements of the irreps of the group SO(3) (see Ref. [3,26]):\n\u27e8g | j, m, n\u27e9 = Djmn(g) = eim\u03d5+in\u03c8d j mn(\u03b8), djmn(\u03b8) = (\u22121)m\u2212n \u221a (j+m)!(j\u2212m)!

(5)\nThus, the Hamiltonian (1) is expressed in terms of the left-invariant vector fields on the group SO(3), H\u0302 = H(\u2212i\u03be), H( f ) = A f 21 + B f 22 + C f 23 and commutes with right-invariant vector fields \u03b7a. The states of a quantum top are determined by the wave function, which is a function on the group SO(3). There is a set of two mutually commuting symmetry operators (the Casimir operator K(\u2212i\u03be) and one of the operators \u03bea). The state of the top with a certain value of quantum numbers j and m is described by the system\nH\u0302 | j, m\u27e9 = E | j, m\u27e9, (6) L\u03022 | j, m\u27e9 = j(j + 1) | j, m\u27e9, J\u0302z | j, m\u27e9 = m | j, m\u27e9.\nNote that the system (6) cannot be solved by the separation method variables. In the standard approach [1,16], the solution of Equation (6) is sought as:\n| j, m\u27e9 = j\n\u2211 n=\u2212j aj,n|j, m, n\u27e9. (7)\nSubstituting (7) in Equation (6), we obtain a (2j + 1)-dimensional linear system\nj\n\u2211 n=\u2212j\naj,n\u2032 ( Hn,n\u2032 \u2212 E\u03b4n,n\u2032 ) = 0, Hn,n\u2032 = \u27e8j, m, n | H\u0302 | j, m, n\u2032\u27e9, (8)\nfor the quantities aj,n. The roots of equation\u2225\u2225Hn,n\u2032 \u2212 E\u03b4n,n\u2032\u2225\u2225 = 0 (9) determine the energy levels of the top, after which the system of Equation (8) allows one to determine the wave functions of an asymmetric top with given values j and m. The secular Equation (9) is of degree 2j + 1. In fact, the eigenvalues E are independent of m. This is so because the Hamiltonian H\u0302 commutes with the raising and lowering operators J\u0302\u00b1 = J\u03021 \u00b1 i J\u03022. The specialization of the eigenvalue (6) equation to m = 0,\nH\u0302 | j, 0\u27e9 = E | j, 0\u27e9, L\u03022 | j, 0\u27e9 = j(j + 1) | j, 0\u27e9, J\u0302z | j, 0\u27e9 = 0 (10)\nadmits separation of variables in the elliptic coordinates [20]. The elliptic coordinates (\u03c11, \u03c12), \u03c11 \u2208 (B, A), \u03c12 \u2208 (C, B) are defined as\nsin \u03b8 sin \u03c8 = \u221a (A \u2212 \u03c11)(A \u2212 \u03c12) (A \u2212 B)(A \u2212 C) ,\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03c8 = \u221a (B \u2212 \u03c11)(B \u2212 \u03c12) (A \u2212 B)(A \u2212 C) , cos \u03b8 = \u221a (C \u2212 \u03c11)(C \u2212 \u03c12) (C \u2212 A)(C \u2212 B) .\nThe solution of the system (10) in elliptic coordinates \u03c8j(\u03c11, \u03c12) = \u27e8\u03c11, \u03c12 | j, 0\u27e9 has the form:\n\u03c8j(\u03c11, \u03c12) = \u039bj(\u03c11)\u039bj(\u03c11),\nwhere function \u039bj(\u03c1) satisfies the differential equation{ 4 \u221a P(\u03c1) d\nd\u03c1\n( 4 \u221a P(\u03c1) d\nd\u03c1\n) \u2212 j(j + 1)\u03c1 + E } \u039bj(\u03c1) = 0, (11)\nwhich can readily be identified to be a Lame equation in algebraic form. It follows from the theory of the Lame differential equation that for integers j, there are 2j + 1 linearly independent and mutually orthogonal functions \u039bj,s(\u03c1) (the Lame polynomials) corresponding to 2j + 1 different eigenvalues Ej,s, s = \u2212j, . . . , j. Solutions to the Equation (11) are represented as series\n\u039b(1)j (\u03c1) = \u2211 \u221e k=0 ak(\u03c1 \u2212 B)j/2\u2212k,\n\u039b(2)j (\u03c1) = \u221a \u03c1 \u2212 A \u2211\u221ek=0 bk(\u03c1 \u2212 B)(j\u22121)/2\u2212k,\n\u039b(3)j (\u03c1) = \u221a \u03c1 \u2212 C \u2211\u221ek=0 ck(\u03c1 \u2212 B)(j\u22121)/2\u2212k,\n\u039b(4)j (\u03c1) = \u221a (\u03c1 \u2212 A)(\u03c1 \u2212 C)\u2211\u221ek=0 dk(\u03c1 \u2212 B)j/2\u2212k\u22121. (12)\nFrom Equation (11), the recurrent relations for the coefficients ak, bk, ck and dk follow, where al = bl = cl = dl = 0 for l < 0. The eigenvalues of Ej,s are obtained from the finiteness conditions for the series (12):\na\u230aj/2+1\u230b = b\u2308j/2\u2309 = c\u2308j/2\u2309 = d\u230aj/2\u230b = 0, (13)\nwhere \u230ax\u230b = max{m \u2208 N | m \u2264 x} is the floor function and \u2308x\u2309 = min{m \u2208 N | m \u2265 x} is the ceiling function. From (13), the eigenvalues Ej,s are determined. For even values of j, we have one equation of degree j/2 + 1 and three equations of degree j/2, whose solution is 2j + 1 different eigenvalues Ej,s. For odd values of j, we obtain three equations of degree (j + 1)/2 and one equation of degree j/2, the solution of which is also 2j+ 1 different eigenvalues Ej,s."

            "text": "In this section, we obtain a complete set of solutions to the stationary Schrodinger equation\nH\u0302\u03a8(g) = E\u03a8(g) (14)\nwith the Hamiltonian (1). Equation (14) can be thought of as the quantum equation on the SO(3) group. To construct solutions of quantum equations on the Lie groups, it is efficient to use the noncommutative integration method [21\u201323,25,27]. We apply this method to the Equation (14). First, we must construct a special representation of the Lie algebra so(3) of the group SO(3). Following the papers [21,23,25,27\u201329], we introduce an irreducible \u03bb-representation\n(\u03bb-irrep) of the Lie algebra so(3), which is parametrized by the parameter j = 1, 2, . . . and acts in the space F j functions of the form\n\u03a8(q) = j\n\u2211 n=\u2212j\ncneinq, q \u2208 Q, cn = const, (15)\nwhere Q = {q = \u03b1 + i\u03b2 | \u03b1 \u2208 [0; 2\u03c0), \u03b2 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e)}. The \u03bb-irrep of the Lie algebra so(3) in space F j is given by the operators\n\u21131(q, \u2202q, j) = \u2212i sin q\u2202q + ij cos q, \u21132(q, \u2202q, j) = \u2212i cos q\u2202q \u2212 ij sin q,\n\u21133(q, \u2202q, j) = \u2202q, [\u2113a(q, \u2202q, j), \u2113b(q, \u2202q, j)] = \u03f5abc\u2113c(q, \u2202q, j). (16)\nThe operators f\u0302a = \u2212i\u2113a(q, \u2202q, j) are Hermitian with respect to the scalar product\n(\u03a81, \u03a82) j Q = \u222b \u03a81(q)\u03a82(q)d\u00b5j(q), \u03a81, \u03a82 \u2208 F j,\nd\u00b5j(q) = Cj dq\u2227dq\n(1+cos(q\u2212q))j+1 , Cj = (2j+1)! 2j(j!)2 , (17)\nand satisfy the commutation relations\n[ f\u0302a, f\u0302b] = i\u03f5abc f\u0302c, K( f\u0302 ) = f\u0302 21 + f\u0302 2 2 + f\u0302 2 3 = j(j + 1).\nThe set of functions \u03c8n(q) = einq is orthogonal with respect to the scalar product (17):\n(\u03c8n, \u03c8n\u0303)Q = 1\nBnj \u03b4nn\u0303, Bnj =\n(j!)2\n(j \u2212 n)!(j + n)! .\nThis follows the formula for the decomposition coefficients (15):\ncn = Bnj(\u03a8, \u03c8n)Q.\nThen, the generalized Dirac function in space F j,\n\u03a8(q) = \u222b\nQ \u03a8(q\u2032)\u03b4j(q, q\u2032)d\u00b5j(q\u2032), \u03a8 \u2208 F j\nis given by the expression\n\u03b4j(q, q\u2032) = j\n\u2211 n=\u2212j\nBnj\u03c8n(q)\u03c8n(q\u2032) = 2j + 1\nCj\n( 1 + cos(q \u2212 q\u2032) )j . (18)\nThe \u03bb-irrep (16) corresponds to a non-degenerate integer coadjoint orbit of the group SO(3) that passes through the covector \u03bb(j) = (j, 0, 0) (see Ref. [22]),\nOj = { f \u2208 R3 | K( f ) = j2, f \u0338= 0}. (19)\nThe Kirillov form \u03c9j = (d f1 \u2227 d f2)/ f3 in the orbit Oj sets a symplectic structure [30]. It is well known that on the symplectic manifold, the Darboux canonical coordinates exist in which the symplectic form is canonical. There is the linear canonical transition\nf1(p, q, j) = \u2212ip sin q + j cos q, f2(p, q, j) = \u2212ip cos q \u2212 j sin q, f3(p, q, j) = p\nfrom the coordinates on the orbit to the Darboux coordinates (p, q), \u03c9j = dp \u2227 dq. Note that the operators f\u0302a can be considered as a result of qp-quantization of the orbit Oj, f\u0302a = fa( p\u0302, q\u0302, j), p\u0302 = \u2212i\u2202q, q\u0302 = q (see Ref. [25]), and the set Q is a Lagrangian submanifold to the orbit Oj. Within the noncommutative integration method of linear differential equations, wave functions of asymmetric top are sought as a solution system of equations\nH\u0302(g)\u03a8(q, j; g) = E\u03a8(q, j; g), (20)[ \u03b7a(g) + \u2113a(q, \u2202q, j) ] \u03a8(q, j; g) = 0, (21)\nwhere the operators \u03b7a commute with Hamiltonian, [H\u0302(g), \u03b7a(g)] = 0. Note that since\n[\u03b7a(g) + \u2113a(q, \u2202q, j), \u03b7b(g) + \u2113b(q, \u2202q, j)] = \u03f5abc ( \u03b7c(g) + \u2113c(q, \u2202q, j) ) ,\nthen the system (21) is consistent. Integration of the system of Equation (21) gives\n\u03a8(q, j; g) = (cos \u03b8 + i cos(q + \u03d5) sin \u03b8)j\u03a6j ( 2 arctan [ ei\u03b8 cot ( q+\u03d5\n2\n)]) . (22)\nSubstituting (22) into the Equation (20), we obtain the reduced equation\nH(\u2212i\u2113(q\u2032, \u2202q\u2032 , j))\u03a6j(q\u2032) = Ej\u03a6j(q\u2032). (23)\nThe Equation (23) describes a quantum asymmetric top in \u03bb-representation. The Hamiltonian H(\u2212i\u2113(q\u2032, \u2202q\u2032 , j)) = H( f\u0302 ) can be considered as the result of qp-quantization of the classic top on the coadjoint orbit (19). Taking into account the explicit form of the \u03bb-irrep operators (16), we obtain an ordinary differential equation for the function \u03a6j(q\u2032):{\n(A sin2 q\u2032 + B cos2 q\u2032 \u2212 C) d 2 dq\u20322 + (sin q\u2032 cos q\u2032)(1 \u2212 2j)(A \u2212 B) d dq\u2032 (24)\n+(A cos2 q\u2032 + B sin2 q\u2032)j2 + j(A sin2 q\u2032 + B cos2 q\u2032)\u2212 Ej } \u03a6j(q\u2032) = 0.\nWhat is remarkable is the fact that by replacing\n\u03a6j(q\u2032) = (\n2(A \u2212 C)(B \u2212 C) \u03c1(q\u2032)\u2212 C\n) j/2\u039bj ( \u03c1(q\u2032) ) , (25)\n\u03c1(q\u2032) = 2(A \u2212 C)(B \u2212 C)\nA + B \u2212 2C \u2212 (A \u2212 B) cos 2q\u2032 + C,\nwe obtain the Lame equation in algebraic form (11) on the function \u039bj(\u03c1):{ 4 \u221a P(\u03c1) dd\u03c1 ( 4 \u221a P(\u03c1) dd\u03c1 ) \u2212 j(j + 1)\u03c1 + Ej } \u039bj(\u03c1) = 0.\nThus, we arrive at the same Equation (11) as in the case of separation of variables in the elliptic coordinate system but on a function of the complex variable \u03c1 = \u03c1(q\u2032). As will be shown below, in contrast to the set of solutions \u03c8j(\u03c11, \u03c12), the set of solutions \u03a8(q, j; g) forms a complete set.\nSolutions that respond to Lame polynomials (12) will be labeled as follows:\n\u03a6(N)j (q \u2032) =\n( 2(A \u2212 C)(B \u2212 C)\n\u03c1 \u2212 C\n)j/2 \u039b(N)j (\u03c1), \u03c1 = \u03c1(q \u2032), N = 1, 2, 3, 4.\nLet us write it explicitly:\n\u03a6(1)j (q \u2032) = (2(A \u2212 B)(B \u2212 C))j/2\n\u00d7\u2211\u221ek=0 ak (B\u2212C)k (cos q \u2032)j\u22122k\n( a \u2212 cos2 q\u2032 )k, \u03a6(2)j (q \u2032) = i(2(A \u2212 B)(B \u2212 C))j/2 \u221a A\u2212C B\u2212C sin q \u2032\n\u00d7\u2211\u221ek=0 bk (B\u2212C)k (cos q \u2032)j\u22122k\u22121\n( a \u2212 cos2 q\u2032 )k, \u03a6(3)j (q \u2032) = (2(A \u2212 B)(B \u2212 C))j/2 \u221a A\u2212C A\u2212B\n\u00d7\u2211\u221ek=0 ck (B\u2212C)k (cos q \u2032)j\u22122k\u22121\n( a \u2212 cos2 q\u2032 )k, \u03a6(4)j (q \u2032) = i(2(A \u2212 B)(B \u2212 C))(j\u22121)/2 \u221a A \u2212 C sin q\u2032\n\u00d7\u2211\u221ek=0 dk (B\u2212C)k (cos q \u2032)j\u22122k\u22122\n( a \u2212 cos2 q\u2032 )k, where a = (A \u2212 C)/(A \u2212 B).\nFunctions \u03a6(N)j (q \u2032) belong to the function space F j only when they contain positive\npowers in cos q\u2032. For this, it is necessary and sufficient that\na1+j/2 = bj/2 = cj/2 = dj/2 = 0, (26)\nfor even j and a(j+1)/2 = b(j+1)/2 = c(j+1)/2 = d(j\u22121)/2 = 0, (27)\nfor odd values of j. Note that the conditions (26) and (27) coincide with the conditions (13), and they determine the known spectrum Ej,s of the quantum asymmetric top. The coefficients a0, b0, c0 and d0 are defined from the normalization condition for eigenfunctions\n\u03a6j,s(q\u2032) = (\n2(A \u2212 C)(B \u2212 C) \u03c1 \u2212 C\n)j/2 \u039bj,s(\u03c1)\nof the operator H(\u2212i\u2113(q\u2032, \u2202q\u2032 , j)), corresponding to the eigenvalues Ej,s:( \u03a6j,s, \u03a6j,s\u2032 ) Q = (2j + 1)\u03b4ss\u2032 . (28)\nThen, the wave functions\n\u03a8q,j,s(g) = \u27e8g | q, j, s\u27e9 = (cos \u03b8 + i cos(q + \u03d5) sin \u03b8)j \u00d7\u03a6j,s ( \u03c8 + 2 arctan [ ei\u03b8 cot ( q+\u03d5\n2\n)]) (29)\ncorresponding to the eigenvalues Ej,s satisfy the Equation (20) and the normalization condition\n\u27e8q, j, s | q, j, s\u27e9 = 1 8\u03c02 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03c8 \u222b \u03c0 0 sin \u03b8d\u03b8 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03d5 \u2223\u2223\u03a8q,j,s(g)\u2223\u22232 = \u03b4j(q, q).\nWe give expressions for the wave functions (29) and the eigenvalues Ej,s for the lowest values of the quantum number j. For j = 0, we have E0,1 = 0 and \u03a8q,0,1 = 1. For j = 1, we have\nE1,1 = A + C, E1,2 = A + B, E1,3 = B + C\nand wave functions\n\u03a8q,1,1(g) = \u221a 3 {\n1 2 [cos(q \u2212 \u03b8 + \u03d5) + cos(q + \u03b8 + \u03d5) + 2i sin \u03b8] cos \u03c8\n\u2212 sin(q + \u03d5) sin \u03c8 } ,\n\u03a8q,1,2(g) = \u221a 3(cos \u03b8 + i cos(q + \u03d5) sin \u03b8), \u03a8q,1,3(g) = \u221a 3(cos \u03c8 sin(q + \u03d5) + [cos \u03b8 cos(q + \u03d5) + i sin \u03b8] sin \u03c8),\nrespectively. Thus, we have obtained a set of solutions (29), which is parameterized by a set of parameters {q, j, s}, where j is the quantum number corresponding to the eigenvalue operator L\u03022, and q \u2208 Q is a complex number that is not an eigenvalue of any integral of motion.\n4. Wigner D-Function and \u03bb-Representation of so(3) Group\nNote that the solution (22) can be represented in the integral form\n\u03a8(q; g) = T j(g)\u03a6(q) = \u222b\nQ D\nj qq\u2032(g)\u03a6(q \u2032)d\u00b5(q\u2032), \u03a6(q\u2032) \u2208 F j, (30)\nwhere the kernel\nD j qq\u2032(g) = (cos \u03b8 + i cos(q + \u03d5) sin \u03b8) j\u03b4j\n( \u03c8 + 2 arctan [ ei\u03b8 cot ( q + \u03d5\n2\n)] , q\u2032 ) (31)\nsatisfies the system of equations( \u03b7a(g) + \u2113a(q, \u2202q, j) ) D\nj qq\u2032(g) = 0,( \u03bea(g) + \u2113a(q\u2032, \u2202q\u2032 , j) ) D j qq\u2032(g) = 0, (32)\nwith the initial condition D jqq\u2032(0, 0, 0) = \u03b4j(q, q \u2032). Using the Equation (18) for the generalized delta function, we obtain\nD j qq\u2032(g) =\n2j(j!)2\n(2j)!\n{ [cos(\u03d5 + q) cos(q\u2032 \u2212 \u03c8) + 1] cos \u03b8\n+i [ cos(\u03d5 + q) + cos(q\u2032 \u2212 \u03c8) ] sin \u03b8\n+ sin(\u03d5 + q) sin(q\u2032 \u2212 \u03c8) }j . (33)\nIt is shown in [22] that for a generalized function satisfying the system of Equation (32) on some unimodular Lie group, the relations\nD j qq\u2032(g \u00b7 g\n\u2032) = \u222b\nQ D\nj qq\u2032\u2032(g)D j q\u2032\u2032q\u2032(g \u2032)d\u00b5j(q\u2032\u2032), D j qq\u2032(g) = D j q\u2032q(g \u22121). (34)\nFrom Equation (34), it is implied that the operators T j(g) in (30) are the operators of the unitary \u03bb-irrep of the group SO(3) in the space F j. Let us find a connection between the Wigner D-function (3) and the D jqq\u2032(g) function. Note that the Wigner D-function can be uniquely defined as a solution to the system of\nEquation (2), with the initial condition Djmn(0, 0, 0) = \u03b4mn. Then, we will look for a solution to the system (2) in the form\nDjmn(g) = C j mn \u222b Q Fm(q)\u03a6n(q\u2032)D j qq\u2032(g)d\u00b5j(q)d\u00b5j(q \u2032). (35)\nSubstituting (35) into (2), by the functions Fm(q) and \u03a6n(q\u2032), we obtain\n\u2212i\u21133(q, \u2202q, j)Fm(q) = mFm(q), (36) \u2212i\u21133(q\u2032, \u2202q\u2032 , j)\u03a6n(q\u2032) = n\u03a6n(q\u2032). (37)\nWhence Fm(q) = eimq, \u03a6n(q\u2032) = einq \u2032 . The coefficient Cjmn has the form\nCjmn = \u221a BnjBmjexp [\ni\u03c0 2 (m \u2212 n)\n] .\nFrom (4) and (5) and the relation (35), it follows that the functions D jqq\u2032(g) are complete and orthogonal: \u222b\nG D\nj qq\u2032(g)D j\u0303 q\u0303q\u0303\u2032(g)d\u00b5(g) = 1 2j+1 \u03b4j(q, \u00af\u0303q)\u03b4j(q \u2032, \u00af\u0303q\u2032)\u03b4jj\u0303,\n\u2211\u221ej=0(2j + 1) \u222b\nQ\u00d7Q D\nj qq\u2032(g)D j qq\u2032(g\u0303)d\u00b5j(q)d\u00b5j(q \u2032) = \u03b4(g \u00b7 g\u0303\u22121). (38)\nThe expression (35) can be written in the form\n| j, m, n\u27e9 = \u221a BnjBmjei\u03c0(m\u2212n)/2 \u222b Q\u00d7Q e inq\u2032\u2212imqd\u00b5j(q)d\u00b5j(q\u2032) | j, q, q\u2032\u27e9\nwhere \u27e8g | j, q, q\u2032\u27e9 = D jqq\u2032(g). Here is an expression for the expansion of the states | j, q, q \u2032\u27e9 in terms of Wigner D-functions | j, m, n\u27e9:\n| j, q, q\u2032\u27e9 = j\n\u2211 n=\u2212j\nj\n\u2211 m=\u2212j\n\u221a BnjBmje\u2212inq \u2032+imq\u2212i \u03c02 (m\u2212n) | j, m, n\u27e9. (39)\nSince the operator H(\u2212i\u2113(q\u2032, \u2202q\u2032 , j)) is Hermitian in the space F j with respect to the inner product (17), then the set of eigenfunctions \u03a8q,j,s(g) is complete:\nj\n\u2211 s=\u2212j\n\u03a6j,s(q\u2032)\u03a6j,s(q\u2032) 2j + 1 = \u03b4j(q, q\u2032), (40)\nwhere the sum over s means the sum over the spectrum of the asymmetric top.

            "text": "In this article, using the noncommutative integration method, we find the complete system of solutions to the Schrodinger Equation (6) for an asymmetric top. It is shown that the noncommutative reduction of the Schrodinger equation reduces it to the Lame Equation (11), which arises when separating variables in an elliptic coordinate system for the states | j, 0\u27e9. In this approach, the spectrum of the asymmetric top arises from the requirement that the solution of the reduced Equation (24) belong to the space F j, which is\ninvariant under the irreducible \u03bb-irrep of the group SO(3). In this case, the set of solutions is expressed by an explicit formula (29), in contrast to the solution in the form of a series (7). It is shown that the complete set of solutions is parametrized by the quantum number q, which takes complex values from the set Q, which has the Lagrangian submanifold to the coadjoint orbit of the SO(3) group. We also obtained a connection (35) between the kernels \u03bb-irrep and the Wigner Dfunction, which allowed us to show the completeness of the set (29). Note that the constructed solutions are not coherent [31\u201334] since they do not minimize the uncertainty relation (\u2206K)2 \u2265 j. Since they are in states that correspond to the basis | q, j, s\u27e9, we have\n(\u2206K)2 = j(j + 1)\u03b4j(q, q)\n= 2j(j!)2\n(2j)! j(j + 1)(cosh 2Imq)j\n\u2265 4 j(j!)2\n(2j)! j(j + 1) \u2265 j2 log 4 > j, j > 0.\nTherefore, the states | q, j, s\u27e9 differ significantly from the coherent states of the quantum asymmetric top [35].\nBy a direct check, one can verify that the set of states\n| j, m, s\u27e9 = \u221a Bmj \u222b\nQ d\u00b5j(q) e\u2212imq | q, j, s\u27e9\n= \u221a Bmj \u222b\nQ\u00d7Q d\u00b5j(q)d\u00b5j(q\u2032) e\u2212imq\u03a6j,s(q\u2032) | j, q, q\u2032\u27e9 (41)\nare eigenstates for the complete set of operators {H\u0302, L\u03022, J\u03023} and satisfies Equation (6) for | j, m\u27e9 =| j, m, s\u27e9. Thus, the states of an asymmetric top with a given value of j and m are determined by the expression (41). Note that since the rotational energy and rotational terms of a large number of polyatomic molecules are described by quantum asymmetric tops, the new solutions obtained in this work can be used in rotational spectroscopy of molecules. The sets of solutions (29) and (41) can be useful for studying the static mixmaster cosmological model (see Refs. [16\u201318,36,37]).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.G. and A.B.; methodology, D.G.; formal analysis, D.G. and A.B; investigation, D.G. and A.B; validation, D.G. and A.B; writing\u2014original draft, D.G.; writing\u2014review & editing, D.G.

Vector Fields on the Group SO(3)\nIn the Lie algebra so(3) of the rotation group SO(3), we introduce some basis {e1, e2, e3}, with respect to the commutation relations of the algebra that have the form [ea, eb] = Ccabec, where the structure constant Ccab = \u03f5abc is the completely antisymmetric tensor, with\n\u03f5123 = 1, [\u00b7, \u00b7] denoting the Lie brackets; a, b, c = 1, . . . , 3. The adjoint representation matrices (ada)cb = [ea, eb] c have the form\nad1 =  0 0 00 0 \u22121 0 1 0 , ad2 =  0 0 10 0 0 \u22121 0 0 , ad3 =  0 \u22121 01 0 0 0 0 0 . The group element of the SO(3) will be parametrized using the Euler angles \u03d5, \u03b8\nand \u03c8:\ng(\u03d5, \u03b8, \u03c8) = gz(\u03c6)gx(\u03b8)gz(\u03c8) \u2208 SO(3), \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 [0; 2\u03c0), \u03b8 \u2208 [0; \u03c0),\nwhere gx(t), gy(t) and gz(t) are rotation matrices by the angle t about the axes Ox, Oy and Oz, respectively:\ngx(t) = etad1 =  1 0 00 cos t \u2212 sin t 0 sin t cos t , gy(t) = etad2 =\n cos t 0 sin t0 1 0 \u2212 sin t 0 cos t , gz(t) = etad3 =\n cos t \u2212 sin t 0sin t cos t 0 0 0 1 . (A1) To find generators of an arbitrary irrep of SO(3), one has to examine representations\nin the space of functions f = f (\u03c6, \u03b8, \u03c8) on the group. The left regular representation TL(g) acts in the space of functions f (g), g = g(\u03c6, \u03b8, \u03c8) \u2208 SO(3) on the group as follows [38]:\nTL(g\u2032) f (g) = f (g\u2032\u22121 \u00b7 g), g\u2032 \u2208 SO(3),\nwhereas the right regular representation TR(g) acts in the same space as follows:\nTR(g\u2032) f (g) = f (g \u00b7 g\u2032), g\u2032 \u2208 SO(3).\nThe decomposition of the left (and right) regular representation contains any irrep of the group. For generators that correspond to the one-parameter subgroup \u03c9(t) in the left TL(g) and right TR(g) regular representations, we obtain, respectively:\n\u03be\u03c9(t) f (g) = d dt TR(\u03c9(t)) f (g) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 t=0 , \u03b7\u03c9(t) f (g) = d dt TL(\u03c9(t)) f (g) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 t=0 .\nVector fields \u03be\u03c9(t) are called left-invariant vector fields, and \u03b7\u03c9(t) are called rightinvariant vector fields, corresponding to the subgroup \u03c9(t). Let us choose one-parameter subgroups as (A1). The straightforward calculations yield the following expressions for generators [35]:\n\u03be1 = \u03begx(t) = sin \u03c8 sin \u03b8 \u2202 \u2202\u03d5 + cos \u03c8 \u2202 \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 cot \u03b8 sin \u03c8 \u2202 \u2202\u03c8 ,\n\u03be2 = \u03begy(t) = cos \u03c8 sin \u03b8 \u2202 \u2202\u03d5 \u2212 sin \u03c8 \u2202 \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 cot \u03b8 cos \u03c8 \u2202 \u2202\u03c8 ,\n\u03be3 = \u03begz(t) = \u2202\n\u2202\u03c8 (A2)\nand\n\u03b71 = \u03b7gx(t) = cot \u03b8 sin \u03d5 \u2202 \u2202\u03d5 \u2212 cos \u03d5 \u2202 \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03d5 sin \u03b8 \u2202 \u2202\u03c8 ,\n\u03b72 = \u03b7gy(t) = \u2212 cot \u03b8 cos \u03d5 \u2202 \u2202\u03d5 \u2212 sin \u03d5 \u2202 \u2202\u03b8 + cos \u03d5 sin \u03b8 \u2202 \u2202\u03c8 ,\n\u03b73 = \u03b7gz(t) = \u2212 \u2202\n\u2202\u03d5 . (A3)\nThe following standard commutation relations hold:\n[\u03bea, \u03beb] = \u03f5abc\u03bec, [\u03b7a, \u03b7b] = \u03f5abc\u03b7c, [\u03bea, \u03b7b] = 0."
