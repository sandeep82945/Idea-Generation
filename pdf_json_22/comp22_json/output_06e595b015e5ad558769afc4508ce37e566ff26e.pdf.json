Our panel of expert referees posses a sound academic background and have a rich publication record in various prestigious journals representing Universities, Research Laboratories and other Institutions of repute, globally. Finalizing the constitution of the panel of referees, for double blind peer review(s) of the considered manuscripts, was a painstaking process, but it helped us to ensure that only the best, interesting and novel of the considered manuscripts are showcased and that too after undergoing multiple cycles of review, as required.\nI wish to express my sincere gratitude to the entire editorial board, members of the resident editorial team and\nour panel of experts in steering the considered manuscripts through multiple cycles of review and bringing out the best from the contributing authors. I thank my esteemed authors for having shown confidence in BJIT and considering it a platform to showcase and share their original research work. I would also wish to thank the authors whose papers could not have been published in this issue of the Journal, probably because of the minor shortcomings. However, I would like to encourage them to actively contribute for the forthcoming issues.\nI will fail in my duty, if I do not thank the members of the team from the Springer, particularly Ms. Suvira\nSrivastav, Ms. Jeyapradha Saravanan, Ms. Bhuvaneswari Rangaswamy, Ms. Teena Bedi and Ms. Nidhi Chandok for their constant support in realizing the issue and presenting it before you.\nThe undertaken Quality Assurance Process involved a series of well defined activities that, I trust, went a long way in ensuring the quality of the publication. Still, there is always a scope for improvement, and so, I request the contributors and readers to kindly mail me their criticism, suggestions and feedback at bjit@bvicam.ac.in and help in further enhancing the quality of forthcoming issues."
