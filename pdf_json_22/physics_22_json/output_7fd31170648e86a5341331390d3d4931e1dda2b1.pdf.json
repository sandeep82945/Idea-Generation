Here we present the solid-solution series NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 with well-defined single crystals over the entire substitution range 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. Chemical and structural analysis indicate a statistically homogeneous replacement of Yb3+ by Lu3+ ions. We magnetically characterize the relatively small single crystals using electron spin resonance (ESR). Below 30 K the ESR intensity can be well described by a Curie-Weiss function for all x, with a decreasing Weiss temperature with increasing Lu content. This reduction of the average magnetic interaction upon Lu substitution is also supported by magnetization measurements. Importantly, no signs of magnetic or spin-glass order are detected down to 2 K for any x. For x > 0.5 the ESR linewidth strongly increases, indicating the breakup of the magnetic system into disconnected clusters as expected from percolation physics. The experimental magnetization data are found to be in good agreement for all x with results of classical Monte-Carlo simulations for a triangular-lattice Heisenberg model, amended with a small second-neighbor interaction. Taken together, our results establish NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 as a family of diluted triangular-lattice spin liquids.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAlthough the existence of quantum spin liquid (QSL) states was already proposed by Anderson nearly 50 years ago [1], the number of comprehensively studied candidate materials has increased only recently [2]. A number of promising materials only qualify as proximate QSLs, such as \u03b1-RuCl3 [3] and Na2IrO3 [4], exhibiting longrange magnetic order at low temperatures. Others are debated because of considerable atomic disorder, such as YbMgGaO4 [5, 6] and H3LiIr2O6 [7], raising doubts on the intrinsic nature of the observed spin-liquid features.\nIn the quest for new spin-liquid compounds, ABX 2 compounds with \u03b1-NaFeO2 structures (with A being a non-magnetic monovalent cation, B a magnetic trivalent cation, and X a divalent anion) attracted considerable attention since NaYbS2 with Yb\n3+ ions on a perfect triangular lattice was proposed as a putative QSL material [8, 9], Figure 1. Further Yb-based compounds such as NaYbO2 [10, 11] and NaYbSe2 [12] were investigated soon afterwards and also found to display no magnetic order down to 50 mK. Triangular lattice Yb compounds have thus established themselves as an important class of spin-orbit-entangled spin liquids [13]. Note that the structure type of these compounds is frequently referred to as delafossite although the mineral delafossite, CuFeO2, features A cations in linear coordination [14]. In NaREX2 and related compounds, A and B cations are both found in octahedral coordination. This atomic arrangement should be referred to as \u03b1-NaFeO2 type. \u03b1-NaFeO2 and CuFeO2 are isopointal, they adopt the same space group type R3\u0304m with similar lattice parame-\nters and respective atoms occupy the same Wyckoff sites but they are not isotypic in a strict sense. Indeed, ABX 2 compounds with \u03b1-NaFeO2 type crystal structure provide a perfect geometrical basis for the realization of a QSL state, as different magnetic ions with predominant antiferromagnetic interactions can be placed on the B -sites forming a regular triangular lattice. Atomic site disorder doesn\u2019t seems to play a dominant role, at least no evidence was found in single crystal diffraction data, NMR or ESR data of NaYbS2 or NaYbSe2, e.g. [8, 10, 12, 15]. The layers of magnetically active B ions are separated by non-magnetic AX 6 octahedral layers, which gives the structure a quasi-two-dimensional character with respect to magnetism (Figure 1).\nTheoretically, triangular-lattice spin models with either Heisenberg or spin-anisotropic exchange interactions have been shown to display QSL phases, accompanied by fractionalization and deconfinement, in certain ranges of their parameter space [16\u201321]. However, precise model parameters to describe the magnetism of such Yb compounds are not known to date. With a clean candidate QSL material at hand, studying its behavior under chemical substitution defines a highly interesting field of research. This includes the physics of carrier doping to achieve metallic or superconducting states [1, 22, 23], magnetic dilution [24], and various forms of bond disorder [25\u201327]. Magnetic dilution, achieved by replacing magnetic with non-magnetic ions, is particularly interesting, as the introduction of magnetic vacancies into quantum paramagnets is able to distinguish confined from deconfined phases [28]; here \u201c(de)confined\u201d refers to the properties of the gauge field in a description in terms ar X iv :2\n20 3.\n02 19\n9v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 1\nA pr\n2 02\n2\n2\nof fractionalized particles coupled to an emergent gauge field. In confined (i.e. conventional non-fractionalized) phases, vacancies introduce quantized magnetic moments which generically lead to magnetic [24] (or spin-glass [29]) order at low temperatures. A nice example is the quantum-dimer magnet TlCuCl3 once small amounts of Cu are replaced by Mg [30]. In contrast, in deconfined (i.e. fractionalized) phases, no vacancy-induced moments are expected [28, 31], such that spin-liquid behavior survives dilution (although special counter-examples have been discussed theoretically [32]). A number of theoretical studies have characterized spin liquids according to their response to the introduction of vacancies [31, 33, 34]. However, in-depth experimental studies on high-quality single crystals of corresponding dilution series of QSL candidates are rare.\nParenthetically, we note that bond disorder has been argued to induce spin-liquid-like behavior in magnets which display long-range order in the clean limit [35\u2013 38]. Moreover, strong dilution has been found to determine the magnetic state of the triangular-lattice system Y2CuTiO6 [39].\nIt is the purpose of this paper to study magnetic dilution for an Yb spin liquid on a triangular lattice. We investigate how the local and global magnetic properties evolve in the solid-solution series NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 with 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1 for which we are able to prepare single crystals covering the whole range of x. With increasing substitution of Yb3+ by non-magnetic Lu3+ we expect the network of exchange couplings to be weakened, such that the x = 0 QSL eventually evolves into a state with singleion paramagnetic properties as x \u2192 1. We characterize the evolution and interplay of magnetic interactions in the substitution series NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 by electron spin resonance (ESR) and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Indeed, ESR is the method of choice for small sin-\ngle crystals [40]. For example, the nature of the ground state of a spin-liquid candidate in the organic salts could be successfully elucidated [41]. NaYbS2 has proven to be ideally suited for investigating the spin dynamics of Yb3+ by ESR [42]: a well-resolved and narrow Yb3+ spin resonance allowed an accurate characterization of the gfactor anisotropy and the static and dynamic properties of the Yb3+ magnetic susceptibility.\nOur experimental data are consistent with spin-liquidlike behavior of NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 in a wide composition range. We do not detect signs of magnetic order down to 2 K for all x. For x > 0.5 we observe a strong increase in the ESR linewidth, indicating a breakup of the magnetic system into percolation clusters and suggesting that exchange interactions beyond nearest neighbors are small. Our measured temperature-dependent susceptibilities are in agreement with corresponding data from classical Monte Carlo simulations of a J1-J2 Heisenberg model with random dilution. Together, these results confirm that our crystals display a statistical distribution of Lu dopants and represent a family of diluted triangularlattice quantum spin liquids."

[43] starting from dried Na2S (see Supplement [44] for its preparation), Yb2O3 (Heraeus, 99.9 %), Lu2O3 (ChemPUR, 99.99 %) and CS2 (Honeywell, Riedel-de Hae\u0308n, 99.9 %) at 1050 \u00b0C in a protective argon atmosphere, following the idealized reaction equation:\n2 Na2S + 2RE2O3 + 3 CS2 \u2192 4 NaRES2 + 3 CO2. (1)\nNa2S (2500 mg, 32 mmol, 29 equivalents) and the respective amounts of Yb2O3 (1\u2212 x eqs.) and Lu2O3 (x eqs.) were mixed in the molar ratios and filled in a glassy carbon boat which was placed in a ceramic tube inside a tubular furnace (Figure S1, [44]). The large excess of Na2S used in the reaction serves as flux material to foster crystal growth. The apparatus including a 1 L flask as CS2 reservoir was flushed with argon for 30 min before the furnace temperature was raised to 1050 \u00b0C within three hours under an unloaded stream of argon (ca. 2 L/h). While dwelling for one hour, CS2 was transported to the reaction zone by bubbling argon (\u2248 5 L/h) through the reservoir.\nAfterwards, the apparatus was cooled down under a stream of unloaded argon (ca. 2 L/h) to 600 \u00b0C within six hours before the furnace was switched off. Throughout the whole procedure, approximately 20 mL (about 330 mmol) of CS2 were consumed.\nThe reaction product was leached with water to remove the flux material and the target compound was filteredoff and washed with water and ethanol. Leftovers of small black particles, presumably carbon, were decanted\n3 after ultrasonication in ethanol. After vacuum drying, the remaining product was found to consist of transparent, yellow hexagonal platelets with diameters ranging from approximately 10 to 800\u00b5m. Crystal surfaces show a faint tarnishing after exposure to moist air for several days or weeks. Crystals used for ESR and magnetization measurements were stored under inert conditions, thus.\nPhase purity and the evolution of the lattice parameters were evaluated by X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD). For this measurements, the samples were mixed with a Si standard and filled in glass capillaries. Rietveld refinements were done with TOPAS Academic [45] in the range of 14 to 130\u00b0 2\u03b8, using the atomic positions of NaYbS2 [46] as starting model. Single-crystal diffraction data of selected crystals were collected to confirm the Rietveld results.\nElemental ratios were measured on several embedded and polished crystals via electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) in combination with imaging respective samples with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The chemical composition of selected samples was additionally checked by optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and combustion analysis. Optical band gaps were determined from diffuse reflection spectra using a Varian Cary 400 UV/Vis spectrometer. Magnetization measurements were performed with a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) vibrating sample (VSM) magnetometer. Crystals used for the magnetization measurements were taken from the same batches as those for the ESR experiments. Electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments were performed at X-band frequencies (\u03bd = 9.4 GHz) using a continuouswave ESR spectrometer. The ESR experiments were performed on single crystalline platelets with a typical size of 0.4 \u00d7 0.4 \u00d7 0.05 mm3. The sample temperature was set with a helium-flow cryostat allowing for temperatures between 2.7 and 300 K [47].\nFurther details on experimental methods are stated in the Supplement [44]."

The typical morphology of the crystals can be seen in the images in Figure 2 taken with a light microscope and a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), respectively. Over the major part of the substitution range, the crystals remain bright yellow, like the ternary border compound NaYbS2. Crystals with high lutetium content (x > 0.8) are pale yellow.\nThe band gaps of NaYbS2 and NaLuS2 were determined to 2.74 and 3.94 eV, matching the reported data of 2.7 eV [9] and 4.08 eV [48], respectively. The band gaps of NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 remain constant at around 2.73 eV until\nFIG. 2. Images of crystals taken under an optical microscope (left panel) and by scanning electron microscopy (right panel).\nx \u2264 0.8, but jump to 3.87 eV for x = 0.9 (Figure S2 [44]). According to band structure calculations of isostructural rare-earth-metal based compounds the band gap mainly results from the distance between the occupied chalcogenide p-states and the REd -state dominated conduction band [49]. The sudden step in the evolution of the band gaps and the corresponding color change can\u2019t be explained by the observed smooth change of the lattice parameters, see below. The UV/vis spectrum of NaLuS2 shows only one absorption edge at 315 nm, whereas the spectrum of NaYbS2 exhibits an additional broad band at 360 nm (see Figure S3 [44]). The latter is attributed to a sulfur to RE charge transfer (CT) transition [50] and can be observed in all compounds with x \u2264 0.8. As the low-energy slope of this CT transition is now used to determine the absorption edge, a considerable drop in band gaps is computed in accordance with the colors of the samples.\nUpon grinding of the crystals under ambient conditions, a faint H2S odour was recognized. X-ray powder diffractograms of ground samples showed small reflections of the respective oxysulfides RE2O2S, so that we assume the following slow decomposition of the ground sample fostered by humidity from air and/or adsorbed water:\n2 NaRES2 + 4 H2O\u2192 RE2O2S + 2 NaOH + 3 H2S. (2)\nReflections of NaOH were not observed in PXRD of the ground samples, probably due to the formation of noncrystalline hydrates of NaOH and/or Na2S. Traces of the oxysulfide were only found after grinding, i.e. in samples with small particles and large surfaces. Crystals stored under inert conditions are stable for years."

            "text": "Chemical analyses confirm the composition of the samples within the error of the respective method, Table S I [44]. The EDX-based sulfur contents of the crystals (47(1) at.-%) was always found slightly below the bulk value from ICP-OES and combustion analysis (49.1(8) at.-%); we attribute this to the embedding and wet-chemical polishing procedure applied before EDX. Carbon (< 1 at.-%) and oxygen amounts (< 0.6 at.-%) of\n4 the bulk polycrystalline samples were generally considered as insignificant for the ESR and magnetic measurements, which were all performed on selected single crystals. No peak splitting or additional reflections were found in the X-ray powder diagrams of the samples. Instead, all reflections can be indexed with space group R3\u0304m and unit cell dimensions close to the border phases NaYbS2 and NaLuS2 so that a complete substitution series NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 1) without phase separation or symmetry reduction can be assumed. The PXRDs of all samples exhibit a strong preferred orientation along the [001] direction. The lattice parameters were refined in the course of the Rietveld fits using the fundamental parameter approach and a manually modelled background\nto take care of the enhanced background at low angles (between 14\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 2\u03b8) caused by the glass capillary.\nThe refined lattice parameters are stated in Table S II [44] and graphically depicted in Figure 3 against the amount of Lutetium. For both ternary boundary phases NaYbS2 (x = 0) and NaLuS2 (x = 1), literature structure data were confirmed. The atomic positions of NaYbS2 were used as start model for the Rietveld refinements, considering a mixed occupancy of the Wyckoff site 2a with Yb and Lu for all compounds with 0 < x < 1. As the electron count of the two rare-earth elements differ by only one, a free refinement of the occupation parameters is merely possible. Instead, the site occupancy factors for both elements were taken from the analytical data (EDX, ICP-OES) and kept fix during the refinements. We found neither evidence for other mixed occupied sites or site defects nor indications for an ordered superstructure at any degree of substitution from these fits. The result of the Rietveld refinement for NaYb0.71Lu0.21S2 is depicted as one example in Figure S4 [44].\nNo peak spitting was observed in the diffraction images of selected single crystals of NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 (with x = 0, 0.4 and 0.9) samples either, confirming the PXRD based Rietveld results. The respective structure models could be refined to good agreement values in space group R3\u0304m; no additional peak positions or suspicious displacement parameters or residual electron density maxima were found. The refinement of the Na and RE site occupancy factors did not deviate from unity within standard deviations, i.e. there is no evidence for Na/RE site disorder from single crystal diffraction data. Figure 1 depicts the crystal structure of NaYbS2 as an example. Crystallographic data and refinement parameters are compiled in Tables S III, S IV and S V, respectively [44].\nAs can be seen from Figure 3, the lattice parameter a decreases linearly with increasing Lu content. This can be easily understood as the larger Yb3+ ion (r = 1.008 A\u030a) is progressively replaced by the smaller Lu3+ ion (r =\n1.001 A\u030a; both radii are given for coordination number 6 [51]). The c lattice parameter, however, gets elongated with increasing Lu content. Note that the change of the lattice parameter c is about seven times smaller than the change in a (0.05 % for c, 0.35 % for a), so that\nFIG. 3. Refined lattice parameters a and c of NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 samples derived from powder and single crystal data.\nthe unit cell volume decreases slightly (Figure S5, [44]). The slight deviations between powder and single crystal data can be attributed to the use of different devices and wavelengths.\nUpon substitution not only the lattice in the ab plane is compressed but also the YbS6 octahedra show a similar trend, as can be seen from the decreasing interlayer sulfur-sulfur distances s1 and the torsion angle \u03b11 of YbS6 octahedra (Figure 1). Unfortunately, the powderbased structure data show some scattering, although displacement parameters and site occupation factor were kept fix to reduce correlations in the Rietveld refinements. The single-crystal data, however, indicate the same trend. The overall changes of 0.6 % for s1 and 0.2 % for \u03b11 are in the same range as those of the lattice parameter a. Consistent with the slight increase in lattice parameter c the NaS6 octahedra slightly increase as well, which can be concluded from the sulfur - sulfur interlayer distances s2 and the torsion angle \u03b12. The changes of the interatomic distances and torsion angles are depicted in Figures S6 and S7 [44]."

            "text": "Typical ESR spectra are shown in Figure 4, left frame. The deviations from an ideal Lorentzian shape are small but visible. For samples with x \u2265 0.8 a multiple line structure appears which is consistent with a Yb-hyperfine split resonance. As shown in Figure S8 [44] this hyperfine split structure is most pronounced for x = 0.9 which indicates a very weak interaction among the Yb spins for this concentration. Delafossite-related Yb compounds show strong anisotropies of their Yb3+ resonance field [52] caused by uniaxial g value anisotropies. For NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 this anisotropy is retained for all investigated Yb-contents and is exemplarily shown for x = 0.5 in Figure 4 (upper right frame). A clear x dependence of the anisotropy g\u22a5/g\u2016 can be resolved as shown in the\n5\nlower right frame of Figure 4. The ESR linewidth behavior \u2206B(T ) is shown in Figure 5. Towards high temperatures, as seen in related Yb compounds [52], \u2206B(T ) shows the same exponential increase being characteristic for an Orbach-type spin lattice relaxation \u2206B \u221d 1/[exp(\u2206/T )\u2212 1] (red solid lines). This relaxation involves the first crystalline-electric field (CEF) split electronic energy level \u2206 above the ground state [53]. We obtained \u2206 = 230 \u00b1 50 K, independent on x, indicating that mainly properties of the CEF ground state are affected by changes of the Yb3+ amount, i.e., changes in the CEF distortion. Noteworthy, changes of the ground-state properties are well resolved in changes of the g-factor anisotropy, see Figure 4.\nTowards low temperatures, as illustrated by a normalized \u2206B(T ) representation, Figure 5 right upper frame, the linewidth behavior clearly depends on the Yb3+ amount (see also the non-normalized plot Figure S9, [44]). For x < 0.8 the linewidths display a moderate broadening, indicating the increasing influence of intersite spin correlations [52]. For x \u2265 0.8 \u2206B(T ) shows, instead of an increase, a decrease becoming pronounced below T \u2248 10 K. Such temperature dependence is unveiled by a diminished spin-spin correlation as it appears concomitant to a single-ion typical hyperfine structure in the line shape. It indicates a direct relaxation of spinorbit coupled spins to lattice vibrations through a modulation of the ligand field, which leads to a linear temperature dependence if a direct phonon process dominates, for instance [53, 54].\nThe linewidth also clearly depends on the Yb content as illustrated for T = 20 K in the right lower frame of Figure 5. With decreasing Yb-content \u2206B first stays at values around 2 mT for x < 0.5 before rising up to \u2206B = 7.5 mT for x = 0.9. This indicates for x > 0.5\nan additional broadening arising from an inhomogeneous Yb-distribution as found for disconnected magnetic clusters, for instance. Note that at the same time the above mentioned contribution of inter-site spin correlations is strongly reduced but still visible up to x \u2264 0.8 in the line broadening towards low temperatures.\nThe ESR intensity IESR \u2261 \u03c7ESR is a direct measure of the spin probe magnetic susceptibility along the direction of the microwave magnetic field bmw [55]. As shown in Figure 6, below approximately 30 K, \u03c7ESR is consistent with a Curie-Weiss law \u221d (T \u2212 \u03b8)\u22121 with negative Weiss temperatures \u03b8. A decreasing Yb3+ content leads to a continuously decreasing \u2212\u03b8 (right frame in Figure 6) as expected for decreasing antiferromagnetic correlations among the Yb3+ spins. This behavior agrees well with measurements of the bulk magnetic susceptibility as illustrated for x = 0, 0.5, and 0.8 in Figure 7. Note, however, that the Weiss temperatures obtained from bulk susceptibility and ESR intensity do not exactly match. The reason for such difference, being also observed in other compounds [13, 55\u201357], could be that spin correlations are probed by ESR locally at the Yb-sites in contrast to magnetic susceptibility which is a non-local and nondynamical probe."

Below 80 K the data can be well described by a Curie-Weiss curve. The Curie-Weiss fits\n6\nshow that the Weiss temperature decreases sharply with increasing Lu amount while the effective moment at Yb hardly changes. These results are in a good agreement with the ESR measurements, i.e., a strong change in the Weiss temperature is observed while the g factor decreases only moderately. The zero-field-cooled (zfc) and field-cooled (fc) mode measurements do not show any branching or pronounced hysteretic behavior. We take this as evidence for the absence of magnetic domains, structural clusters, or glassy-like effects. As shown for the example of NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 with x = 0.8, only a small difference in the order of about 0.01 T, is visible in the magnetization curve (at 10 K) with ascending and descending magnetic field (Figs.

The classical ground state of this model depends on the ratio J2/J1: For J2/J1 < 1/8 a coplanar 120\n\u25e6 state is realized, while J2/J1 > 1/8 yields a collinear four-sublattice state [58]. For quantum spins S = 1/2, numerics indicates the existence of a fractionalized quantum spin liquid for 0.08 < J2/J1 < 0.16 whose precise nature, however, has not been clarified beyond doubt [16\u201319]. With spin\nanisotropies included, the nearest-neighbor exchange model has also been shown to host quantum spin-liquid phases [20, 21]. At this point there is no definite consensus on the microscopic model faithfully describing the triangular spin-liquid candidates.\nTo theoretically assess the effect of dilution on the magnetic properties of NaYbS2 at elevated temperatures, we confine ourselves to a study of (3) in the classical limit. We perform classical MC simulations on lattices of linear size L and periodic boundary conditions. Our spins are then replaced by classical vectors of fixed length S. Depletion is simulated by randomly removing a fraction x of spins, with the total number of spins Ns = (1\u2212 x)N . We perform equilibrium MC simulations using single-site updates with a combination of the heat-bath and microcanonical (or over-relaxation) methods. For simulations at high temperatures, the simulations reach equilibrium quickly and tens of thousands of MC steps per spin are sufficient to evaluate the thermal averages. Disorder averages are taken over Nrl samples, with Nrl \u223c 100.\nBefore discussing numerical results, we recall that previous work on vacancies in non-collinear triangularlattice antiferromagnets has shown that an isolated vacancy induces a uniform magnetic moment in the ground state [59]. As a result, a weak residual Curie term in the susceptibility at very low T is expected even for small nonzero x [59, 60]. For a model with nearestneighbor coupling only, the threshold for site percolation is xp = 1/2, such that a system with statistically distributed vacancies and x > xp consists of magnetically disconnected finite-size clusters only. Consequently, larger Curie contributions (per spin) are expected, arising from clusters with an odd number of sites, which grow\n7 as x\u2192 1. Small non-zero values of J2 will produce only small corrections to this picture.\nSimulation results for the normalized linear-response magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T )/Ns are shown in Figure 8 for different levels of dilution. While \u03c7(T ) follows a Curie-Weiss law for all x at elevated T , it tends to saturate upon cooling for small x in the T range shown, but strongly increases for large x. In particular, the x = 0.9 result is not far from a pure Curie law, consistent with the above considerations.\nThe Curie-Weiss law can be analyzed quantitatively: High-temperature expansion for the diluted Heisenberg antiferromagnet yields the exact result [61] kB |\u03b8| = (1\u2212 x)S(S + 1)z(J1 + J2)/3, with z = 6 being the number of nearest-neighbor sites. This qualitative x dependence, \u03b8(x) = (1 \u2212 x)\u03b8(x = 0), is in good agreement with the ESR-extracted linearity in Fig. 6 (right frame). From matching the Curie-Weiss temperature at x = 0, \u03b8(x= 0) = 11.2 K (taken from magnetic susceptibility), we can extract a nearest-neighbor coupling of J1 = 7.5 K if we assume J2 = 0, or J1 = 6.7 K for J2/J1 = 0.12, the former in agreement with Ref. 13.\nFor a quantitative comparison between the simulation and experiment of the full temperature dependence of \u03c7, we need to take into account that the natural energy scale for the classical magnet is J1S\n2 while this is replaced for the quantum magnet by J1S(S + 1). The plot of the susceptibility data with the data from the simulation shows a fairly good agreement (Figure S12, [44]). The best match was found for (J1S\n2)cl = 4 K, corresponding to an exchange coupling J1 of about 5.3 K, but some deviations between calculation and experiment remain at low temperatures in particular for doped samples. They may originate in additional\ncontributions to the experimental susceptbility, either intrinsic (Van Vleck) or extrinsic (background signal of the sample holder), but they may also reflect the fact that the J1-J2 Heisenberg model is not sufficient to fully capture the physics of the material which in fact can be expected to display significant spin-orbit coupling."

The lattice parameters of the series ideally follow Vegard\u2019s rule and neither evidence for a phase segregation nor for an ordered superstructure was found. The band gaps change only for high Lu contents and the magnetic susceptibility reflects the amount of Yb3+ ions. The ESR spectra of NaYb1\u2212xLuxS2 show clear dependencies on the Yb 3+ content. It was shown that small differences in the lattice parameters upon changing the Yb3+ amount produce small changes in the crystal fields and the g values of the effective spin-1/2 Kramers Yb3+ doublets. Also, the interaction among the Yb3+ spins, as reflected in the ESR linewidth and ESR intensity, as well as in Weiss temperatures, changes with Yb3+ amount. The line shape for the lowest investigated Yb amount of x = 0.9 has clear features typical for a hyperfine splitting, indicating single-ion behavior of independent Yb3+ spins.\nIn summary, we have shown that the magnetic exchange network of NaYbS2 can be tuned by a random Lu substitution on the Yb site while maintaining the strong frustration. Further measurements, such as heat capacity, AC suceptibilty or \u00b5SR sepctroscopy, in the sub-Kelvin regime are necessary and scheduled to examine if the QSL state is preserved upon Lu doping up to the percolation threshold, as suggested by our present results. Thus, non-magnetic substitution opens up a new direction in QSL research, e.g., in order to elucidate to what extent the magnetic field\u2013temperature phase diagram is affected by the controlled dilution."
