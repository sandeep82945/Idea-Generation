    "abstractText": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a crucial reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a crucial role in redox signaling in physiological and pathological processes of living cells. Its normal production is closely related to signal transduction of living cells. Overproduction of H2O2 in vivo has been proved to be related to many diseases. Some were developed to reveal the roles of H2O2. However, current fluorescent probes for the detection of H2O2 are restricted in their short emission wavelengths and small Stokes shifts that significantly decrease the sensitivity of detection and cellular visualization. In this work, a novel fluorescent probe BC-B was designed and synthesized with pinacol phenylboronic acid ester as a recognition group and near-infrared fluorophore BC-OH as a reporter group. BC-B probe exhibits a large Stokes shift (122 nm) and near-infrared emission (672 nm), showing an excellent selectivity and sensitivity in detection of H2O2 with the limit of 0.003 \u03bcmol/L. Confocal fluorescence imaging further demonstrates that BC-B can be used for detecting endogenous H2O2 in living cells.",

BC-B probe exhibits a large Stokes shift (122 nm) and near-infrared emission (672 nm), showing an excellent selectivity and sensitivity in detection of H2O2 with the limit of 0.003 \u03bcmol/L. Confocal fluorescence imaging further demonstrates that BC-B can be used for detecting endogenous H2O2 in living cells.\nKEYWORDS\nhydrogen peroxide, fluorescent probe, near-infrared, large Stokes shift, cellular visualization\nIntroduction\nH2O2 is an important reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living systems (Halliwell et al., 2000; Stone and Yang, 2006). Endogenous H2O2 is mainly produced by NADPH oxidase complexes. Compared with other ROS, H2O2 has a higher concentration and is more stable in vivo. Normal physiological level of H2O2 plays a vital role in cell damage (Jantas et al., 2020), differentiation (Fujita et al., 2021), apoptosis (Quillet-Mary et al., 1997), iron death (Qi et al., 2021) and oxidative stress (Yang L. et al., 2020). Abnormal level of H2O2 is implicated in numerous diseases, such as inflammation (McDonald et al., 2020), neurodegenerative diseases (Fukui and Kato, 2021), diabetes (Wang et al., 2021a), ulcerative colitis (Wang et al., 2020) and cancer (Zoumpourlis et al., 1991; Wang et al., 2021b). Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a high effective method with good sensitivity and selectivity to monitor intracellular H2O2 in biological systems.\nCompared with other methods, Fluorescence probe technology used for detection of intracellular H2O2 has the advantages of non-invasiveness and good biocompatibility (An et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021) over the"

Many fluorescent probes for H2O2 are developed based on small molecular fluorophores such as rhodamine (Gu et al., 2020), coumarin (Du et al., 2010), naphthalimide (Sun et al., 2013), and BODIPY (Purdey et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2021). However, these fluorescent probes usually have short emission wavelength (<650 nm) and small Stokes shift (<100 nm), which limit their detection of H2O2 in cells or deep tissues. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop a fluorescence probe with large Stokes shift (>100 nm) and near infrared emission (>650 nm) for the detection of intracellular H2O2.\nIn this study, we designed and synthesized a novel fluorescent probe BC-B using a malononitrile isophorone derivative (BCOH) that has large Stokes shift and near infrared emission (Yang X. et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2020; Shu et al., 2020; Shiraishi et al., 2021) as a fluorophore and a phenylboronic acid pinacol ester group as a recognition group. BC-B probe exhibits selective and potent detection of H2O2 with a large Stokes shift (122 nm) near infrared emission (672 nm), giving rise to desirable imaging of endogenous H2O2 in living cells."

While H2O2 (50 \u03bcmol/L) was added into the BC-B (10 \u03bcmol/L) system, the system emitted strong fluorescence at 672 nm with excitation of 550 nm. The emission wavelength of BC-B with H2O2 is the same to that of the fluorophore BC-OH. The results suggested that the probe BC-B can react with H2O2 to release BC-OH fluorophore, showing strong fluorescence. The H2O2 (50 \u03bcmol/L) solution pretreated with reactive oxygen scavenger NAC (1 mmol/L) for 5 min was added into BC-B solution (10 \u03bcmol/L) and incubated for 110 min, the fluorescence intensity of the system at 672 nm is significantly weaker than that of probe BC-B with H2O2 group, but stronger than that of the free probe BC-B group. When the probe BC-B was incubated with NAC (1 mmol/L) for 110 min, the fluorescence intensity was the same to that of BC-B. As the probe BC-B reacted with H2O2, the UV absorption peak appeared at 550 nm. The UV absorption spectral is similar to that of BC-OH (Supplementary Figure S1).\nThese data further illustrated that H2O2 made BC-B probe release BC-OH fluorophore and showing strong fluorescence, we used HPLC to examine the mechanism of the probe BC-B (Scheme 2 and Supplementary Figure S2).\nThe fluorescence intensity of BC-B system at 672 nm increased with the concentration of H2O2, and a good linearity was built between the fluorescence intensity of BC-B probe and the concentration of H2O2 (y = 38.35 + 9.29196x, R 2 = 0.98892) (Supplementary Figure S3A). The limit of detection was calculated to be 3 nmol/L according to the equation LOD = 3\u03c3/k. These results show BC-B has high sensitivity to H2O2 and can quantitatively detect H2O2 in vitro.\nTime- and pH-dependent effect of BC-B probe on detecting H2O2\nFirst, the time-dependence of BC-B for detecting H2O2 was evaluated through measuring the fluorescence of BC-B after\nFIGURE 2 Spectral response of BC-B to H2O2.

As shown in Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S3B, the free probe BC-B shows a little fluorescence in 120min, indicating that BC-B probe is very stable in PBS solution. As H2O2 was added into the\nsolution of BC-B, the fluorescence intensity (672 nm) of the system increased gradually during the incubation time of 0\u2013110 min, and reached the maximum value at 110 min. Then, we measured the fluorescence changes of BC-B in presence or absence of H2O2 at different pH ranging from 3.4 to 10.5. As shown in Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S3C, the fluorescence intensity of BC-B (10 \u03bcmol/L) at 672 nm was relatively stable with excitation at 550 nm. After incubation of BC-B with H2O2 (20 \u03bcmol/L) for 110 min, there was no fluorescence response under acidic conditions, while a good fluorescence response under alkaline conditions (pH = 7.4), this indicated that the BC-B has an ability to detect H2O2 under alkaline conditions.\nSelectivity and anti-interference capacity of BC-B\nThe selectivity of analytes is an important parameter to evaluate property of fluorescent probes. It can be seen from Figure 2C that H2O2 induces a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity of BC-B, while the fluorescence intensity of other active species changes slightly, which indicates that the BC-B can specifically respond to H2O2. Then, add other active species to the solution of BC-B and H2O2 for interference test.\nFIGURE 3 The cytotoxicity of BC-B (0\u201330 \u03bcmol/L) against HeLa cells was analyzed by using MTT assay.\nFIGURE 4 Fluorescence images of exogenous H2O2 in HeLa cells.

These results revealed that BC-B has excellent selectivity for H2O2 and has potential application in visualization of H2O2 in complex cell environment (Figure 2D).\nConfocal imaging of HeLa cells for detection of H2O2 level by BC-B\nCell survival percentagewas calculated byMTTassay.As shown in Figure 3, the survival percentage of the 0 \u03bcmol/L BC-B was considered equal to 1 and the survival percentage of other samples was calculated according to the 0 \u03bcmol/L BC-B. High viability values of HeLa cells were obtained when treated with 30 \u03bcmol/L BC-B. Cell viability values measured by the MTT assay demonstrate that BC-B has a little cytotoxicity, andhas the potential to be used to visualizeH2O2 inHeLa.\nBased on the excellent sensitivity, selectivity and biocompatibility of BC-B for H2O2, the ability of BC-B to visualize intracellular H2O2 was tested. As shown in Figure 4, compared with the BC-B group, the fluorescence intensity of the red channel in the BC-B + H2O2 group was significantly enhanced, this result indicates that BC-B can be used to visualize exogenous\nH2O2 in HeLa cells. After treating H2O2 incubated HeLa cells with active oxygen scavenger NAC, the fluorescence intensity of HeLa cells (NAC + BC-B group) incubated by BC-B was significantly weak comparing to that of BC-B group, which indicates that BC-B can be used to visualize endogenous H2O2 in HeLa cells.\nIn order to detect endogenous H2O2, PMA is used to stimulate the excessive production of H2O2 in cells. As expected, PMAtreated cells showed brighter fluorescence than untreated cells (Figure 5A). In addition, as shown in the third column of Figure 5A, the bright fluorescence is inhibited after adding NAC. The normalized fluorescence intensity shows the fluorescence change of the three groups (Figure 5B). Therefore, BC-B can image the endogenous H2O2 produced by living cells."
