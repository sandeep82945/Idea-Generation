            "text": "The compounds 1 and 2, (2 mg), was refluxed in 10% HCl in 75% EtOH (3 mL) for 6 h. After cooling, the reaction mixture was concentrated in a water bath at 40 \u00b0C and extracted with EtOAc (3 mL). The aqueous layer containing the sugar was re-dissolved in 1 mL of pyridine and heated with 6 mg of L-cysteinemethyl ester at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h. Phenylisothiocyanate (0.1 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, which was heated at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated in a water bath, dissolved in acetonitrile, and analyzed via RP-HPLC (Diamonsil C18: 4.6 mm \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm) with a mobile phase of 25% MeOH/water (flow rate of 1 mL/min) and a UV detector (250 nm). Authentic D-glucose and L-glucose were derivatized and analyzed using the same protocol. By comparing the retention times of the sugar derivative obtained from 1 and 2 with the retention times of standard D-glucose (tR 28.20 min) and L-glucose (tR 28.90 min) derivatives, the sugar moiety was determined to be D-glucose (Vinh et al. 2019).\nTable S1. 1H and 13C NMR data of compounds 1 and 2\nNo. 1\n2\n\u03b4Ca,b \u03b4Ha,c mult.
