    "abstractText": "Product information (PI) is a vital part of any medicinal product approved for use within the European Union and consists of a summary of products characteristics (SmPC) for healthcare professionals and package leaflet (PL) for patients, together with the product packaging. In this study, based on the English corpus of the EMA product information documents for all centrally approved medicinal products within the EU, a BERT sentence embedding model was used together with clustering and dimensional reduction techniques to identify sentence similarity clusters that could be candidates for standardization. A total of 1258 medicinal products were included in the study. From these, a total of 783 K sentences were extracted from SmPC and PL documents which were aggregated into a total of 284 and 129 semantic similarity clusters, respectively. The spread distribution among clusters shows separation into different cluster types. Examples of clusters with low spread include those with identical word embeddings due to current standardization, such as section headings and standard phrases. Others show minor linguistic variations, while the group with the largest variability contains variable wording but with significant semantic overlap. The sentence clusters identified could serve as candidates for further standardization of the PI. Moving from free text human wording to auto-generated text elements based on multiple-choice input for appropriate parts of the package leaflet and summary of product characteristics, could reduce both time and complexity for applicants as well as regulators, and ultimately provide patients and prescribers with documents that are easier to understand and better adapted for search availabilities.",

The ePI project mainly concerns the technical aspects of documents and aims to enhance accessibility of PI and promote best practices for creating product information for medicinal products [4]. Developing an electronic format with structured elements accommodates benefits brought by continuously evolving digital opportunities which will enable more efficient retrieval of information and facilitate the use of alternative e-platforms. As ePI can be read by machines, ePI information can flow to other systems such as electronic health records and e-prescribing systems. This will hopefully facilitate targeted delivery of the right information to the right user at the point of need.\nIn addition to the technical aspects, there will be challenges remaining after the expected\noutput from the ePI project has been delivered. Several of these are related to the language itself contained in the documents, which are created by applicants and regulators in an iterative process to obtain a marketing authorization. Although there are current linguistic PI standards implemented manually for certain aspects of style, terminology and use of abbreviations, substantial variability is introduced between medicinal products in sentences where identical messages could be communicated. This process is time-consuming, may cause difficulties in search functions, creates uncertainty as to whether the content of different sets of PI is identical, and could potentially result in an increased risk of medication error [5, 6]. Whereas standardised messages could and should be used already today, a digitalization of the format will facilitate the use of exact standards, as well as to offer possibilities to streamline, simplify and speed up the regulatory processes.\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has been rapidly evolving since the intro-\nduction of transformer models [7]. These models are, without supervision or human imputation, trained on huge corpuses of text and contains high-dimensional semantic word embeddings based on textual context. In 2018, Devlin et al presented BERT, a Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformersmodel with 340 million parameters, which became state of the art in the field of NLP and has found many applications and undergone adaption to specific tasks [8]. Lately, BERT has been outperformed\u2014particularly in creative NLP applications\u2014by the much larger generative language models such as GPT-3 which have hundreds of billions of parameters [9]. However, the BERT architecture has remained a well-performing alternative for tasks such as classification and needs substantially less computing power.\nNLP techniques have previously been applied to extract information from FDA medicinal\nproduct information [10]. Also, there is previous work on model-based standardisation of clinical information and lexical simplification of technical terms [11\u201313]. In this study, based on the English corpus of the EMA PI documents for all centrally approved medicinal products within the EU, we use a BERT sentence embedding model together with clustering and dimensional reductional techniques to identify PI sentence similarities that could be standardized, for the benefit of patients, prescribers, and marketing authorization holders alike."

In addition to our similarity clusters, we provide a freely available database containing a total of 783 K sentence tokens that are indexed and mapped to the medicinal product, document type and document subsection from which they originated.\nWe chose to analyse SmPC and PL documents separately, in line with the regulatory prac-\ntise to compile these documents in separate processes tailored for their respective group of professional and non-professional end users. However, given that many messages are shared across the two types of documents, the linguistic relationship and potential for a more unified workflow should be explored in the future.\nAlthough not specifically trained on a corpus of medical or pharmaceutical language, the\nBERT sentence embeddings allowed for semantic analysis of medicinal product information documents. This could to some extent be a result of regulatory language standards, making these documents contain far less medical specialist terms compared to health records. However, a language model trained on a corpus including medical and regulatory text would likely perform even better.\nWith the parameters for clustering that were used in this project, a total of 15% of sentences\nin the SmPCs and 23% of sentences in the PL documents were assigned to a semantic cluster. The absolute level of clustering should be interpreted with caution as it is highly dependent on what level of in-cluster similarity and minimum cluster size is sought, but the relative difference in clustering rate between SmPCs and PLs indicates that the PLs have a lower degree of linguistic variability.\nTable 1.

Such format would facilitate the use of existing established standard references, already translated into all EU languages. Where information such as \u201cNo dose adjustment is needed/No dose adjustment in children is needed\u201d has been found, it may not need harmonisation as such, but rather electronic structure connected to both standard and subheading, i.e., both wording and place in the document will be important when forming structured standards.\nFields where standardized sentences are of great value, such as storage precautions and cer-\ntain warning texts have already been harmonised by presenting standard sentences in EMA guidelines. The approach developed in this study could be used for further standardization, potentially valuable for regulatory processes as well as for down-stream use of the product information. Nevertheless, although the sentence clusters identified could serve as candidates for future standardization, the PI will always contain unique product-specific statements.\nIn the current approach only centrally approved medicinal products were included, which\nare all fairly new and where a single version of product information is used as a base for translation in all EU member states. Expanding the analysis to products approved in decentralized or national procedures, where documents by procedural nature vary between products of even the same active substance or therapeutic class, could provide further insight and further the potential for standardisation."

            "text": "In this study, we have shown that currently available data science tools can identify semantically similar statements in medicinal product information. This could serve as a basis in a future process of standardisation, which would allow automation for parts of the PI compilation process. Moving from free text human wording to auto-generated text based on multiplechoice input for appropriate parts of the summary of product characteristics and package leaflet would reduce both time and complexity for applicants and regulators, and ultimately provide patients and prescribers with documents that are easier to understand and better adapted for search availabilities. For the foreseeable future, it will remain essential that the final documents are assessed by domain experts at the competent authorities involved, keeping the human in the loop throughout the process."
