Development of Aerogels with Enhanced Load-Bearing Capacity: Investigating the synthesis of KGM-silica aerogels with enhanced mechanical properties for structural applications. This could involve exploring different polysaccharides or modifying the cross-linking density within the interpenetrating network (IPN) structure to enhance load-bearing capacity without compromising thermal insulation and fire retardancy.

Study on the Scalability of Aerogel Production Methods: Conducting research on the scalability and economic viability of the co-precursor method for producing KGM-silica aerogels. This could include optimization of the production process for industrial scale-up, analysis of cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact assessment to promote the large-scale application of these aerogels in insulation and fire protection.

Functionalization of Aerogels for Specific Applications: Exploring the functionalization of KGM-silica aerogels with specific additives or coatings to tailor their properties for unique applications such as oil-water separation, catalysis, or as carriers for drug delivery. This could involve the incorporation of functional groups or nanoparticles to introduce hydrophobicity, catalytic activity, or controlled release capabilities.

Investigation into the Durability and Longevity of Aerogels: Assessing the long-term stability and durability of KGM-silica aerogels under various environmental conditions. Research could focus on the effects of humidity, temperature fluctuations, and mechanical stress on the structural integrity and performance of aerogels over time to ensure their reliability for long-term applications.

Eco-friendly and Biodegradable Aerogel Alternatives: Developing fully biodegradable and eco-friendly aerogel alternatives by exploring natural and renewable materials other than KGM for the polysaccharide component. This could include studying the properties of aerogels made from cellulose, chitin, or alginate, focusing on improving their mechanical strength, thermal insulation, and fire retardancy while ensuring that they are compostable at the end of their lifecycle.
