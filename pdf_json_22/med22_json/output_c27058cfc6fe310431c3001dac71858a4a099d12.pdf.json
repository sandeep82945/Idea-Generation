    "abstractText": "Background: During the COVID\u201019 pandemic, outpatient eating disorder care, including Family\u2010Based Treatment (FBT), rapidly transitioned from in\u2010person to virtual delivery in many programs. This paper reports on the experiences of teams and families with FBT delivered by videoconferencing (FBT\u2010V) who were part of a larger implementation study. Methods: Four pediatric eating disorder programs in Ontario, Canada, including their therapists (n = 8), medical practitioners (n = 4), administrators (n = 6), and families (n = 5), participated in our study. We provided FBT\u2010V training and delivered clinical consultation. Therapists recorded and submitted their first four FBT\u2010V sessions. Focus groups were conducted with teams and families at each site after the first four FBT\u2010V sessions. Focus group transcripts were transcribed verbatim and key concepts were identified through line\u2010by\u2010line reading and categorizing of the text. All transcripts were double\u2010coded. Focus group data were analyzed using directed and summative qualitative content analysis. Results: Analysis of focus group data from teams and families revealed four overarching categories\u2014pros of FBT\u2010V, cons of FBT\u2010V, FBT\u2010V process, and suggestions for enhancing and improving FBT\u2010V. Pros included being able to treat more patients and developing a better understanding of family dynamics by being virtually invited into the fam\u2010 ily\u2019s home (identified by teams), as well as convenience and comfort (identified by families). Both teams and families \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022, corrected publication 2022.

            "text": "It is well known that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant detrimental impact on those affected by and treating eating disorders [1, 2]. In addition to a worsening of eating disorder-related symptoms, individuals with eating disorders have also reported higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms throughout the pandemic [1]. Some healthcare providers treating eating disorder patients have also experienced a sense of therapeutic inefficiency and compromised therapeutic alliance [2], as they struggle to manage the surge in eating disorder cases, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions\u2014particularly among youth\u2014during this time [3\u20136].\nThe most widely used evidence-based treatment for children and adolescents with eating disorders is Family-Based Treatment (FBT) [7\u20139], in which parents are placed in charge of the refeeding process and interrupting disordered eating behaviours, while being supported by a therapist during family sessions [8]. The term FBT is often used interchangeably with Family Therapy for Anorexia Nervosa (FT-AN) and Maudsley Family Therapy, as they all refer to eating disorder focused family therapy following the same principles and shared theoretical\nframeworks, however FBT differs slightly in that a published treatment manual exists for FBT [10].\nAlthough there is a growing body of evidence supporting the clinical effectiveness of FBT adapted for virtual care, uncertainties remain with respect to its implementation, particularly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; research in virtual adaptations of FBT are currently limited to case studies and small sample feasibility studies [11, 12].\nWith COVID-19 variants continuing to emerge, it is anticipated that virtual care will be regularly offered in the foreseeable future [13]. While convenient, the nature of virtual treatment adaptations and their effective delivery requires examination to ensure acceptability and feasibility among those delivering and those receiving the treatment. Adaptations that focus on improving treatment suitability for the target population can lead to improved engagement, acceptability, and clinical outcomes [14], but modifications that alter or remove core components of a treatment, or which neglect population needs, may be less accepted among patient or provider populations [15]. Failing to understand the treatment modifications needed for virtual care, as well as the systematic processes that can contribute to implementation\nrecognized technical difficulties as a potential con of FBT\u2011V, yet teams also commented on distractions in family homes as a con, while families expressed difficulties in developing therapeutic rapport. Regarding FBT\u2011V process, teams and families discussed the importance and challenge of patient weighing at home. In terms of suggestions for improvement, teams proposed assessing a family\u2019s suitability or motivation for FBT\u2011V to ensure it would be appropri\u2011 ate, while families strongly suggested implementing hybrid models of FBT in the future which would include some in\u2011person and some virtual sessions.\nConclusion: Team and family perceptions of FBT\u2011V were generally positive, indicating acceptability and feasibility of this treatment. Suggestions for improved FBT\u2011V practices were made by both groups, and require future investigation, such as examining hybrid models of FBT that involve in\u2011person and virtual elements.\nTrial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04 678843.\nPlain English summary Family\u2011Based Treatment\u2014the leading outpatient treatment for children and adolescents with eating disorders\u2014 rapidly transitioned to virtual delivery during the COVID\u201119 pandemic in many programs. This study qualitatively describes the perceptions and experiences of teams and families related to the first four sessions of Family\u2011Based Treatment delivered via videoconferencing (FBT\u2011V) during the COVID\u201119 pandemic, using end\u2011of\u2011study focus groups. Our findings suggest that FBT\u2011V is generally well\u2011received amongst these stakeholders. Therapists found that imple\u2011 menting FBT\u2011V was relatively seamless, and families described the convenience and comfort of sessions taking place virtually in their own homes. However, therapists revealed concerns of distractions in family homes impacting ses\u2011 sions, and families had some difficulties in developing therapeutic rapport. As a result, additional modes of delivering Family\u2011Based Treatment should be explored to address challenges present in virtual care. This might include hybrid models of treatment delivery, involving a combination of in\u2011person and virtual sessions.\nKeywords: Eating disorders, Anorexia Nervosa, Virtual care, Family\u2011based treatment, COVID\u201119, Therapists, Medical practitioners, Program administrators, Families, Qualitative research\nor success, may hinder outcomes, acceptability, and feasibility [16, 17].\nPast research suggests that virtual models and adaptations of therapy are acceptable and feasible, including FBT [11, 18]. In a study that explored the acceptability and feasibility of delivering FBT via telehealth, all 10 adolescent participants remained in treatment after 20 sessions over six months, suggesting acceptability and feasibility, and their percent mean body mass index significantly increased at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up [11]. A recent case study during the COVID19 pandemic, including a young adult and an adolescent, examined a virtual adaptation of FBT delivered over a 4-week period. Adaptations involved an enhanced multidisciplinary team (e.g., family therapist, dietician, peer mentor, and family mentor) and virtual treatment delivery; findings indicated strong acceptability among the two patients. In addition, both patients achieved the desired weight gain and a reduction in eating disorder symptoms [18]. Additionally, experts in FBT have commented on delivering FBT via videoconferencing during the COVID-19 pandemic, noting the many challenges of transitioning to virtual care in this field, and highlighting the need for further examination of acceptability and feasibility of this treatment [19].\nOur study evaluated the initial implementation of FBT delivered by videoconferencing (FBT-V) in four pediatric eating disorder treatment programs in Ontario, Canada. We hoped to further develop clinical capacity for virtual care within our healthcare system for this population, and to improve access to evidence-based pediatric eating disorder treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. This paper reports on the qualitative findings of the study, specifically examining the experience of delivering and receiving the first four sessions of FBT-V from the perspectives of teams and families."

Ethical approval was received from the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board, as well as the ethics boards/committees at each of the participating sites. Details pertaining to the objectives and methodology of the larger study are published within a protocol paper [20]. Findings pertaining to our implementation approach which comment on fidelity, maintenance of key components of FBT, and patient outcomes have been submitted for publication elsewhere [21].\nFor the current qualitative study, the principles of qualitative description [22] were followed and our research team completed semi-structured focus groups with\nteams and families who had provided or received FBT-V during the COVID-19 pandemic within our implementation study. Teams included therapists, medical practitioners and administrators at each site. Although the whole team participated in their respective focus group, the therapist was most able to speak to the delivery of FBT-V and thus, team qualitative data in this paper mostly arises from the therapists. Despite this, medical practitioners and program administrators were included in the focus groups as they participated in the FBT-V training and implementation consultation meetings in our study. By allowing these individuals the opportunity to comment on FBT-V and our implementation approach, this further expanded our understanding of what FBT-V implementation entails in an eating disorder program. As program administrators are responsible for managing the program, and medical practitioners diagnose the patient with an eating disorder, it is important that they are on board with supporting FBT-V, to ensure the best possible care is provided to patients. As a result, it is important to capture medical practitioner and program administrator thoughts on the implementation of FBT-V, in addition to those of therapists."

These sites vary in terms of geography and service capacity, as two are located in large urban areas and are based in hospitals, offering inpatient, day hospital, and outpatient services for eating disorders, whereas the other two sites are community-based organizations located in smaller regions that can only provide outpatient eating disorder services.\nEighteen individuals from the four sites and five families (n = 21) were recruited for this project (see Table\u00a0 1 for detailed demographic information). In order to participate, therapists had to have had prior training and experience in delivering standard FBT. Of the eight participating therapists, only five were able to successfully recruit a patient for the study; the other three therapists remained in the study and continued to participate in consultation meetings to learn from their colleagues, as well as the end-of-study focus group. This allowed them to provide their thoughts on FBT-V, given that they continued to deliver FBT-V despite not having a study patient, as well as having participated in other aspects of our implementation approach, including the FBT-V training workshop, and therefore they should be given the opportunity to comment on this. All participating patients were diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa by the medical practitioners involved in the study. Two\nparticipants (one medical practitioner and one therapist) withdrew from the study due to medical absences from work that were unrelated to the study; another participant (one administrator) withdrew from the study due to retirement."

Training was led by external experts (JL and KA) and local experts (JC and CW) on the study team. After training, each therapist was invited to enroll one eligible family (adolescent < 18\u00a0 years of age with Anorexia Nervosa) into FBT-V and video record their first four sessions, each of which were submitted to the research team for review.

Our study intervention involved a virtual adaption of FBT (FBT-V), where therapy sessions occurred virtually via Zoom for Healthcare, but medical appointments for the child remained in-person. For a full description of the adaptations made to FBT for virtual delivery please see our protocol paper [20]. Therapists were instructed to conduct FBT-V sessions following the same key components and principles of FBT, as outlined in the FBT manual [8]. This included obtaining patient weights (either with the therapist present on screen with only the child, or the parent(s) weighing the child in session with the\u00a0 therapist present\u2014both acceptable) and reviewing the weight graph with the family, providing an opportunity to independently speak with the child (e.g., at the beginning of the session before or after weighing of the patient),\u00a0and conducting a family meal in session 2, all\u00a0 while using externalization and agnosticism throughout."

While inductive approaches are often used to generate new theories or insights from a lack of existing research, the deductive approach of directed content analysis is used when prior research exists about the phenomenon of interest [23]. We chose a deductive approach based upon existing literature about virtual implementation of eating disorder treatment for pediatric patients, including FBT [11, 12]. Focus group transcript data were allocated to codes, and any text that did not fit into the initial coding scheme was provided a new code. Codes were continuously refined through multiple readings of the transcripts and in consultation with the research team, until all codes were appropriate and applied accurately. Finally, data that fit under each code were represented as counts through summative content analysis, while also presenting representative quotes to contextualize these findings. Compared to other qualitative analytics techniques, content analysis was chosen as we wanted to stay close to the data and not make interpretations; a summative content analysis was chosen to provide counts of codes and because it also introduces minimal interpretation into analysis while offering a \u201cstraight description\u201d of the patterns or regularities of participants responses [22,\n24]. All transcripts were coded in duplicate by two coauthors. A third team member resolved any coding conflicts via the facilitation of a consensus meeting with the two coders. Qualitative data and coding procedures were managed using NVivo 10 (QSR International Pty Ltd., Version 8, 2008)."

Therapists remarked that technical difficulties threatened the impact of sessions, particularly for families located in remote settings and/or with poor internet connections. Therapists did not believe that technical difficulties in this study significantly impacted any of their sessions, however they were described as frustrating when they did occur. Additionally, one therapist described lower levels of commitment to and preparation for sessions amongst some families receiving FBT-V, in comparison to the preparation that typically precedes in-person treatment (e.g., having to drive to an appointment versus logging onto a computer several minutes before a session). This therapist stated that this lack of physical and mental preparation and anticipation before a session could contribute to reduced motivation for treatment and less impactful sessions, which could pose a risk to treatment success. The same therapist also recognized that while it can be beneficial to be welcomed into the homes of their patients virtually through FBT-V, this can also be unfavourable, as therapists may have less control over FBT-V sessions due to unexpected distractions occurring in the family homes, which can detract from serious discussions:\n\u201c\u2026When you\u2019re going into somebody\u2019s house, you have to respect their house\u2026 there is something different about going into somebody\u2019s home\u2026 you\u2019re on\ntheir turf versus them being on your turf\u2026 in [their] house when a kid might leave the room or somebody knocks at the door for a package and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got a disruption\u2026 You don\u2019t have control over that if it does happen.

One therapist believed that this might be beneficial to hear all family members more clearly through virtual platforms, especially if working with large families or those with poor internet connections. Another suggestion included assessing a family\u2019s suitability or motivation for FBT-V; the convenience and ease of logging into a virtual platform for treatment may enable some families to fall into a treatment that may not be the best fit for them. For this, emphasizing the expectations of virtual treatment ahead of time might help mitigate this issue.\nGiven the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, teams were unsure whether the delivery of FBT would ever return to only being offered in-person. However, one administrator from a remote Northern Ontario study site (i.e., the only centre offering pediatric\neating disorder outpatient treatment in this region) commented that their program had been offering virtual treatment regularly prior to the pandemic, due to geographical barriers that commonly impede patients and their families from attending in-person visits. As a result, their site plans to continue offering and advocating for FBT-V beyond the pandemic, as they strongly believe it enables the best service and treatment for their patients in this region. This administrator said:\n\u201cWe have worked using virtual options for quite some time\u2026and I\u2019ve really pushed that because service our clients [with virtual treatment options] maybe much earlier than many other programs because of necessity. We just\u2026absolutely needed to do this.\u201d (Site 1)."

For convenience, this included the ability to partake in treatment from home and not having to travel to sessions, evidenced by one participant stating:\n\u201cI think it was great, honestly, to get all of us somewhere, another location, would\u2019ve been more challenging, and [whether] we would even be able to do it would be a question...it was great having [treatment] right here on our dining room table.\u201d (Site 3).\nIn terms of comfort of FBT-V sessions, this was often referred to as being able to have difficult and emotional conversations in a familiar and relaxed setting, such as their family home:\n\u201cI would say I felt more comfortable having conversations that are tough in our own home.\u201d \u201cYeah. It is definitely more comfortable in your own home.\u201d (Site 2).\nOther benefits of virtual delivery of FBT reported by families included: (a) cost-effectiveness, as parents reported few costs incurred (e.g., time) in order to attend the sessions; (b) the virtual platform used in this study, which was reported as satisfactory for treatment (by parents and adolescents); and (c) the ease of use for children to adapt to a virtual format, as parents found that their children\u2019s recent experiences with virtual school allowed them to adapt well to online therapy such as FBT-V."

One parent stated:\n\u201cI found it was a bit more challenging because we\u2019ve never met [therapist]\u2026 I found that a bit difficult\u2026 I probably won\u2019t do virtual [again] unless it was someone I really knew for a long time and I felt comfortable enough...I would have been maybe a bit more open or forthcoming if I had known her.

Families divulged their thoughts towards specific virtual adaptations, including the virtually delivered family meal and patient weighing conducted by the parents (as opposed to a clinician in standard FBT practice). Families typically reported the family meal session to be most uncomfortable regardless of whether it was to occur virtually or in-person, although one parent and their child thought an in-person family meal session might be more awkward. One parent noted that while uncomfortable, the family meal holds a great deal of importance, even if it occurs virtually, as it enabled the therapist to witness first-hand components of mealtime that are triggering for their child and helped in empowering parents to persevere through meal challenges. Parents also made remarks about having to weigh their child at the beginning of each session, as required in FBT-V. Most found that this component was difficult but stated that it became easier as the sessions progressed and recognized the importance of their child being exposed to their weight for recovery. One parent stated:\n\u201cThat was a little strange, [obtaining and] looking at the weight and telling [patient] the numbers. But then we got used to that because I guess you need to normalize them looking at numbers and scales and have to be comfortable with their weight\u2026that was hard at first, but then it got better.\u201d (Site 4)."

Family members proposed\nhaving at minimum the first few sessions occurring inperson and then switching to virtual delivery, facilitating a balance of convenience and rapport. One parent stated:\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve been better, I think, if we at least on the initial visit with [therapist] that we could\u2019ve met face-to-face so that we get to know each other better and more intimate in terms of discussing the issues that we had.\u201d (Site 3).\nOne sibling agreed, saying:\n\u201cI feel like a mix would be good. It\u2019s great for convenience, but I think that the first ones should be in-person so that they actually meet each other\u2026 Engaging with someone in-person the first time you meet them\u2026 it would\u2019ve been more effective to immediately feel comfortable right? I think that being in-person for that, [therapist] would be able to read [patient\u2019s] emotions better\u2026just to get to know [patient] better.\u201d (Site 3).\nOther suggestions made by families included having the patient choose whether to receive virtual or in-person treatment, and being offered alternative virtual platforms that families might be more familiar with, like Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business. Some families proposed changes to FBT more generally. These included increased one-on-one time between the patient and the therapist, an additional family meal, and a reduction in the frequency of sessions (e.g., bi-weekly instead of weekly). Regardless of these suggestions, all families reported that they would recommend FBT, delivered virtually or inperson (depending on the circumstances), to other families affected by eating disorders. One child expanded on this, saying:\n\u201cI definitely would\u2026it really helped me realize a lot of things. This is my first time really learning about eating disorders, so I didn\u2019t really know a lot about them and how serious they are until this whole thing.

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to qualitatively evaluate the perspectives of teams and families with respect to virtually delivered FBT for pediatric eating disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of initial FBT-V implementation were captured through focus groups with teams consisting of therapists, medical\npractitioners, and program administrators, as well as focus groups with families. Based on our qualitative findings, FBT-V is acceptable and feasible among teams delivering and families receiving the treatment, however suggestions for improvement were made. There was also a clear preference from families for in-person or hybrid models of treatment.\nWith respect to its advantages, teams acknowledged being able to treat more patients virtually than in-person, whereas families commented on the convenience, comfort, and cost-effectiveness of FBT-V. Therapists and families recognized technical difficulties as a disadvantage of FBT-V. Therapists and families differed in their perceptions of the therapeutic connection. Families described missing a strong connection to their therapist that they believed would have occurred if they met in-person, while one therapist felt that they became better acquainted with family dynamics by being virtually invited into their home. When recalling the task of weighing their child during each session, parents stated that this was difficult, yet it became easier over the course of the study, and like therapists, acknowledged that exposing their child to their weight was important for recovery. Families explained that while impactful, the family meal session was uncomfortable and awkward, and they presumed that this would be the case whether it occurred in-person or virtually. Nonetheless, families recognized the importance of FBT, as all families reported that they would recommend this treatment, delivered virtually or in-person (dependent on the circumstances), to other families living with eating disorders.\nRegarding therapist perceptions of virtual therapy, other research mirrors some of our findings. A recent mixed methods study involving mental health clinicians delivering virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic similarly had clinicians report virtual platforms as being easy to operate and recognized that virtual care enabled increased access to care for their patients/ families; they also highlighted technical difficulties and trouble managing disruptions in their patients\u2019 homes as strong challenges [25]. These clinicians also described that virtual care impacted their patient interactions including rapport building and managing confidentiality and privacy in their patients\u2019 homes [25], Conversely, trouble developing therapeutic rapport was identified as a disadvantage by the patients and families in our study, and not identified as a challenge by our therapists. It is possible that during earlier stages of the pandemic when FBT-V was more novel, the individual with the eating disorder as well as their family not being in the physical presence of the therapist might have interfered with therapeutic alliance from the perspective of a therapist to a greater degree. However, as the\npandemic persists, therapists may be becoming more accustomed to delivering therapy virtually, whereas this remains unusual for families, especially those that have never received eating disorder treatment before, and thus may have a stronger impact on their ability to connect with their therapist.\nConsidering additional familial views, a recent case study [26] involving three young women with eating disorders who received a virtual, home-based treatment model of care found perceptions of virtual treatment similar to our study. For example, some patients and families found the online intervention acceptable and assisted in improving their behaviours, but others noted several challenges that acted as barriers to effectiveness, such as feeling anxious and uncomfortable disclosing sensitive information online [26]. More generally, systematic review results related to patient views of virtual mental health care indicate patient satisfaction with psychotherapeutic interventions and therapeutic alliance that is comparable to in-person delivery [27]; however this review does not contain findings from the COVID-19 era, which might also have influenced some experiences with virtual care during our study. For example, participants in our study had no choice but to participate in FBT-V, as in-person FBT was not available due to COVID-19 restrictions. This might have created some frustration as there was no option for in-person treatment.\nOur results suggest the importance of testing hybrid models of FBT in the future, as almost all family members expressed an interest in FBT that contains both in-person and virtual components. Alternatively, therapists and other implementation team members did not explicitly suggest hybrid models of FBT but did propose other suggestions for improved future FBT-V practice. These included proposing the option to record FBT-V sessions and reviewing these recordings with families at a later date to demonstrate progress, having family members log into the virtual platform on different devices, assessing a family\u2019s suitability or motivation for FBT-V while emphasizing the expectations of virtual treatment (prior to its commencement) to ensure it would be a good fit, and advocating for FBT-V beyond the pandemic. It is important to note that focus groups amongst teams and families were occurring concurrently. Therefore, we were unable to inform therapists about the familial preference for in-person or hybrid models of treatment, as it was not yet concluded that most family members voiced this preference, and as a result, teams could not comment on this. Additionally, therapists were recruited to partake in our study aiming to examine our implementation approach of virtually delivered FBT, where a hybrid model of treatment was never part of our study protocol. Therefore, therapists may not have thought to comment on a hybrid model during their focus group,\ngiven their role in only delivering FBT-V for the purpose of this study. Even if therapist-provided feedback and suggestions (as stated above) are implemented into FBT-V, it is worthwhile to explore therapists\u2019 preference for FBT delivery\u2014whether it is in-person, virtual, or hybrid. Understanding the factors that influence preference amongst care providers may provide insight into how the nuanced relationship between therapists and pediatric eating disorder patients is affected by care delivery format.\nOur study also lacked a direct comparison to what in-person FBT would entail during the COVID-19 era, including wearing masks and other personal protective equipment during sessions, remaining physically distanced from their therapist and possibly other family members, and the possibility of last-minute appointment cancellations due to someone unexpectedly being exposed, exhibiting symptoms, or testing positive for COVID-19. Given these safety measures required for any in-person treatment during this time, perhaps therapeutic rapport would not have been greater between each family and their therapist with in-person treatment. Furthermore, in some centres during the pandemic, only one parent was allowed to accompany their child to appointments, making in-person family therapy impossible. As a result, we believe future research should also be conducted that compares FBT-V to in-person FBT with COVID-19-related restrictions.\nFindings from our study also support the need for greater examination of virtual adaptations of family therapy, including FBT. As new COVID-19 variants continue to emerge and potential \u201cwaves\u201d create uncertainties for the future, it is safe to assume that virtual options for family therapy are likely here to stay, especially as families become accustomed to receiving services within their homes to some degree and mental health services recognize the cost savings of online therapy [28]. Furthermore, if family therapy continues to expand to be delivered virtually, this also creates an opportunity to test and examine virtually delivered training, supervision, and competence evaluation [29].\nNotable strengths were apparent in our study. First, our study used rigorous qualitative methodology [22, 23], as we conducted separate focus groups with whole teams and families, respectively, to obtain a wide variety of perspectives pertaining to delivering and receiving FBT-V. Additionally, all families consented into our study remained in the study for its entire duration, and completed their focus group, and therefore no gaps in family data were present. Despite the challenges of staff turnover and illness, almost all staff participated in their respective end of study focus group (only three staff members did not attend). Our sample was also geographically diverse as we included sites and individuals\nfrom across Ontario, enabling representation from rural, urban, and remote settings.\nLimitations to our study include its small sample size. Our research team made several attempts to increase the number of participating sites to have a larger sample size in our study, as we reached out to seven additional organizations. While expressing interest, all organizations declined, stating that they did not have the capacity to participate in research due to increased clinical caseloads, staff burnout, and decreased staffing resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Although one of our sites had three participating therapists trying to recruit study patients, only one family for one therapist was enrolled into this study; family recruitment was especially challenging at this site, given staffing changes and shortages.\nAnother limitation of this study is that we assessed family perceptions after only four sessions of treatment, rather than at the end of a full course of FBT-V. Had perceptions been studied at the end of FBT-V, families might have recalled different feelings and attitudes towards virtual care. The lack of a comparison group in our study is another possible limitation. While treatment teams could draw on previous experience with in-person FBT to comment on the pros and cons of FBT-V, it might have been more challenging for families to comment on this as they had never experienced FBT in person. Lastly, despite acknowledging the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on both families affected by and staff treating eating disorders [1, 2], our study did not aim to evaluate or mitigate this impact amongst these populations. As a result, future research in this area is required, particularly related to understanding how virtually delivered treatment might affect this psychological impact created by the pandemic."

Families that received FBT-V felt it was convenient, cost-effective, and beneficial in contributing to improved eating disorder symptoms. However, therapists noted lacking the same level of control over virtual sessions compared to in-person care, due to distractions in homes of families. Most families voiced a preference for in-person treatment due to difficulties in building therapeutic rapport with their therapist in FBT-V and were especially interested in a hybrid model of FBT that involved some in-person and\nvirtual components. Further research is required, such as examining hybrid models of FBT among this patient population.\nAbbreviations FBT: Family\u2011based treatment; FT\u2011AN: Family therapy for Anorexia Nervosa; FBT\u2011 V: Family\u2011based treatment delivered via videoconferencing.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s40337\u2011 022\u2011 00631\u20119.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
