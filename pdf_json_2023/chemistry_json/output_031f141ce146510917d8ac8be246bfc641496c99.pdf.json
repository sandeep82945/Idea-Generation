    "abstractText": "Chinese yam (Dioscorea opposita) tuber has a significant effect of invigorating the intestine and improving the symptoms of long-term diarrhea according to the records of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Phenanthrene polyphenols from Chinese yam, with higher inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) than anti-inflammatory drugs, are an important material basis in alleviating ulcerative colitis via nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB)/COX-2 pathway, based on our previous research. The present study further explored the target and molecular mechanisms of phenanthrenes\u2019 modulation of the NF\u03baB/COX-2 signaling pathway by means of molecular docking and gene silencing. Firstly, interleukin8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) expression of 6-hydroxy-2,4,7-trimethoxyphenanthrene (PC2)/6,7-dihydroxy-2,4-dimethoxyphe-nanthrene (PC4) were compared on TNF-\u03b1 induced human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells. Secondly, molecular docking and dynamics simulation were implemented for PC2/PC4 and COX-2. Finally, COX-2 silencing was performed on TNF-\u03b1 induced Caco-2 cells to confirm the target of PC4 on NF-\u03baB/COX-2 pathway. Lower expression of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 in PC4 treated Caco-2 cells indicated that PC4 had stronger anti-inflammatory activity than PC2. The binding of PC4 and COX-2 was stronger due to the hydrogen bond between hydroxyl group and Tyr385. No significant differences were found in phosphorylation nuclear factor kappa-B inhibitor alpha (pIkB\u03b1), phosphorylation NF-\u03baB (pNF-\u03baB) and phosphorylation extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) expression between control and PC4 group after silencing, while these protein expressions significantly decreased in PC4 group without silencing, which confirmed that COX-2 was the important target for PC4 in alleviating ulcerative colitis. These findings indicate that PC4 was supposed to have inhibited NF-\u03baB pathway mediated inflammation via suppression of positive feedback targeting COX-2.",

            "text": "Chinese Yam (Dioscorea opposita) tubers have been consumed for more than 3000 years [1]. They contain many nutrients such as starch, protein, free amino acids and vitamins, and are rich in bioactive substances including polyphenols, polysaccharides and saponins [2,3]. Polyphenols in yam display antioxidant, anti-neuroinflammatory and nitrite elimination activities. Woo et al. demonstrated that phenolic derivatives obtained from ethanol extract of Dioscorea nipponica possessed good neuroprotective activity in C6 glioma cells [4]. Yam polyphenols were also found to inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) in inflammatory cells [5] and selectively reduce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity, thus suggesting their antiinflammatory effect [6]. In recent years, phenanthrene polyphenols extracted from plants\nNutrients 2023, 15, 883. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15040883 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2023, 15, 883 2 of 17\nor synthetic phenanthrene compounds have attracted wide attention due to their good antiinflammatory, antioxidant and antibacterial effects [7], much preliminary research focusing on the anti-inflammatory activity of phenanthrene compounds in vitro [8\u201310]. However, few reports have explored the in-depth anti-inflammatory mechanism clarification of Chinese yam polyphenols, especially the phenanthrene polyphenols. The cell inflammation model is widely used in vitro to analyze the bioactivity of phytochemicals. Abbasi et al. compared the cellular inflammation inhibitory effects of polyphenols obtained from agro-industrial by-products and observed that the expression of inflammatory factor interleukin-8 (IL-8) in human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells was greatly reduced with grape pomace and spent coffee ground polyphenol extracts treatment [11]. Red cardoon stalk polyphenols inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation by resisting the secretion of IL-8, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL10 in Caco-2 cells [12]. In addition, phenolic compounds in navy bean and light red kidney bean milks have strong anti-inflammatory effects in a Caco-2/EA.hy926 co-culture model and these phenols were verified to regulate oxidized low density lipoprotein-induced inflammatory mediators through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [13]. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) plays a key role in inflammatory response, entering the nucleus to transcribe various proinflammatory factors [14]. The activation of NF\u03baB during inflammatory response is regulated by different kinases such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress activated protein kinase [15\u201317]. COX-2 enzyme is mainly located in the nuclear membrane and regulated by NF-\u03baB. When tissue is stimulated by inducers, phospholipase A2 is activated to hydrolyze cell membrane phospholipids into arachidonic acids, which are catalyzed by COX-2 enzymes to produce prostaglandins (PGs). It has been proved that PGs exist in the positive feedback loop of chronic diseases [18]. Chronic mastitis response was induced by a COX-2-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-E-series of prostaglandin receptors type 2 (EP2)-NF-\u03baB positive feedback loop, which suggested a potential mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity after COX-2 was inhibited as a drug target. Besides, bioactive substances could inhibit inflammation by down-regulating the expression of NF-\u03baB, inhibiting COX-2 enzymes and inactivating PGs involved in the inflammatory process [19]. Glycytol was observed to inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway in lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophages and then downregulated the expression of COX-2 protein [20]. At present, there are few studies focusing on research into the target role of COX-2 and the molecular mechanism. In our previous study, 6-hydroxy-2,4,7-trimethoxyphenanthrene (PC2, Figure 1A) and 6,7-dihydroxy-2,4-dimethoxyphenanthrene (PC4, Figure 1B) were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of Chinese yam peel, which exhibited higher COX-2 inhibition than anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen [21]. PC4 alleviated dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced intestinal mucosal injury in mice via modulation of the NF-\u03baB/COX-2 pathway [22]. To further explore the target and molecular mechanism of the polyphenols in alleviating intestinal mucosal injury, the present study intended to compare the anti-inflammatory activities of PC2 and PC4 with a Caco-2 cell model and analyze the molecular docking and dynamics simulation between the two polyphenols and COX-2. Based on the Caco-2 inflammatory cell model, COX-2 gene silencing and western blot analysis, we revealed the target and molecular mechanism of PC4 in regulating the NF-\u03baB/COX-2 signaling pathway. The research results will lay a theoretical foundation for the development of phytochemicals that alleviate ulcerative colitis.\nNutrients 2023, 15, 883 3 of 17\nNutrients 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 17\ntheoretical foundation for the development of phytochemicals that alleviate ulcerative colitis.\nChinese yam characteristic polyphenols PC2 and PC4 were obtained from the ethyl acetate crude extract of Chinese yam polyphenol prepared by our research group.

Therefore, we performed molecular dynamics simulation to study the dynamic\nNutrients 2023, 15, 883 7 of 17\nmovement of COX-2 active site during inhibition and herein reported the role of COX-2 active residues. The RMSD of compounds and COX-2 amino acid skeleton atom within 50 ns were calculated to test the stability of the system (Figure 4A). The RMSD values of PC2 and PC4 systems basically remained unchanged and reached equilibrium after 20 ns. It is generally considered that the method is feasible when the RMSD value is in the range of 0.1\u20130.3 nm [27]. The RMSD values of the two complexes in this research were about 0.2 nm, which represented that the simulation results could be used for further analysis.\nNutrients 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 17\nstable polar interaction between PC2 and Tyr385. Therefore, the binding of PC2 and COX-2 was ainly through van der Waals force and hydrophobic interaction without hy rogen bond, which was consistent with the results of the molecular docking interaction analysis.\nTo summarize, COX-2 was a good potential target for PC2 and PC4. Due to the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of PC4 (position 7) and Tyr385 site of COX-2 protein, the binding between PC4 and COX-2 protein was stronger than PC2, resulting in higher anti-inflammatory activity.\n3.3. COX-2 Gene Silencing PC4 was selected as the research object owing to its stronger anti-inflammatory activity and COX-2 molecular binding ability. To further confirm whether COX-2 was the target of Chinese yam active ingredient regulating NF-\u03baB/COX-2 pathway, the effects of PC4 on the protein expression of the main inflammatory pathway were evaluated by western blot in COX-2 gene silenced cells. The COX-2 gene silencing Caco-2 cell model was established as presented in Figure 5. In comparison with the normal cells group, the mRNA expression of siRNA-1 and siRNA-3 decreased significantly (p < 0.05) without significant differences between them, indicating that siRNA-1 and siRNA-3 exhibited good COX-2 gene silencing effect. However, there was no significant change in the expression of siRNA-2 compared to NC group, thus siRNA-1 or siRNA-3 was selected as the silencing plasmid.\nskeleton atom were calculated to analyze the fluctuation of the system (Figure 4B). On the whole, the amino acid fluctuation trends of the two systems were roughly similar. PC2 system had low fluctuation at amino acids of 345, 349, 527 and 534, and PC4 system was at amino acids of 349, 385, 527 and 534. The amino acids with low RMSF values in the two systems were consistent with the key amino acids. Hydrogen bond or hydrophobic interaction between the compounds and the amino acids around the COX-2 enzyme binding pocket made the key amino acids more stable, which was conducive to the interaction between ligands and receptors. In order to further investigate the difference of binding affini y between PC2/PC4 and COX-2 recep o , the bindi g free energy of the complexes were calculated by MM/PBSA method. Van der Waals energy and electrostatic energy were the m st favorable for the binding of the two compounds with COX-2; non-polar solvation was also favorable for binding while, compared with the values of van der Waals en rgy and electrostatic en rgy, the contribution of non-polar solvation was weak and the polar solvation was detrimental to the combination of the sy tem (Table 1B). The polar interaction in the solvent largely\nNutrients 2023, 15, 883 8 of 17\noffset electrostatic energy and as a result the non-polar interaction, especially the dominant van der Waals energy was more conducive to the binding of ligand and receptor. The binding electrostatic energy between PC4 and COX-2 was lower than that of PC2, which might cause the difference in the binding free energy between two polyphenols and protein. As is known, Gibbs free energy must be negative for the reaction to proceed. The values of \u2206Gbind (binding free energy/Gibbs free energy) for both two phenanthrenes/COX-2 complexes were negative, i.e., reactions between these two phenanthrenes and COX-2 could proceed. On this basis, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were meaningful. A smaller binding free energy value represented lower energy requirement, which profited the binding of ligand and protein. Consequently, it could be concluded that the binding strength of protein-ligand for PC4 was stronger than PC2, coinciding with the molecular docking scoring results. During MD simulation, it was observed that the hydrogen bond between PC2/PC4 and Tyr385 remained relatively stable after 5 ns (Figure 4C). It was worth noting that the hydroxyl group of Tyr385 was close to the hydroxyl substituent of PC4 (distance around 2 \u00c5), which indicated that PC4 was firmly controlled on the hydroxyl group of Tyr385 in COX-2 through a strong hydrogen bond. Meshram et al. also predicted the existence of strong hydrogen bonds between flavonoids and COX-2 by molecular dynamics simulation [27], indicating that hydrogen bonds played an important role in the combination of natural substances and COX-2. Nevertheless, the distance between the methoxyl group of PC2 and the hydroxyl group of Tyr385 in COX-2 (greater than 6 \u00c5) showed a highly unstable polar interaction between PC2 and Tyr385. Therefore, the binding of PC2 and COX-2 was mainly through van der Waals force and hydrophobic interaction without hydrogen bond, which was consistent with the results of the molecular docking interaction analysis. To summarize, COX-2 was a good potential target for PC2 and PC4. Due to the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of PC4 (position 7) and Tyr385 site of COX-2 protein, the binding between PC4 and COX-2 protein was stronger than PC2, resulting in higher anti-inflammatory activity."

As shown in Figure 7C, PC4 pretreatment significantly inhibited pERK1/2 protein level with a dose-dependent manner in NTP groups without COX-2 gene silencing. However, the expression of pERK1/2 protein in sTP0.78 and sTP1.56 groups had no significant changes compared with sT group after COX-2 gene silencing, suggesting that PC4 did not inhibit ERK1/2 protein in MAPK pathway. In this experiment, pIkB\u03b1, pNF-\u03baB and pERK1/2 protein levels in sT group were similar to that in NTP1.56 group, which indicated that the lack of COX-2 enzyme could inhibit the inflammation of Caco-2 cells, and further confirmed the key role of COX-2 enzyme in inflammation response. Studies have shown that chronic inflammation induced COX-2 expression and COX-2, PGE2, EP2 and NF-\u03baB produced positive fe dback loops to amplify inflammatory signals [18,28], which might explain why PC4 could still influence the expression of its upstream proteins IkB\u03b1, NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 after acting on th downstream inflammatory factor COX-2 enzyme. In addition, there was no significant difference in NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 protein levels among the treatment groups, while IkB\u03b1 and pIkB\u03b1 had the opposite expression trends. The inflammatory pathway mainly functions through phosphorylated proteins. The change trends of pIkB\u03b1, pNF-\u03baB and pERK1/2 in different groups were roughly the same, which was consistent with the results of Guo and Shen et al. [29,30]. The reason for the same trend was that NF-\u03baB dimer binds to IkB\u03b1 in an inactive state, then IkB\u03b1 phosphorylates to form pIkB\u03b1 and dissociates from NF-\u03baB when cells were stimulated; ultimately, NF-\u03baB enters the nucleus to start the downstream inflammatory pathway. Simultan ously, ERK1/2 is the upstream protein of NF-\u03baB which can regulate the activation of NF-\u03baB protein. Therefore, the expression of pNF-\u03baB protein was consistent with pERK1/2. In conclusion, PC4 was a good inhibitor of COX-2 enzyme, which exerted anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting COX-2 protease and regulated the expression of pIkB\u03b1, pNF-\u03baB and pERK1/2 proteins through a positive feedback loop.\nNutrients 2023, 15, 883 10 of 17\n1\nNutrients 2023, 15, 883 11 of 17trie ts 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 17\nFigure 7.

However, the expression of pERK1/2 protein in sTP0.78 and sTP1.56 groups had no significant changes compared with sT group after COX-2 gene silencing, suggesting that PC4 did not inhibit ERK1/2 protein in MAPK pathway.\nFigure 7.

            "text": "The global incidence rate of ulcerative colitis is increasing year by year and its pathogeny includes intestinal mucosal injury, enviro mental trigger and intestinal microbial effects, etc. [31,32], From our previous report, ulcerative colitis mice models were established to study the intestinal mu osal protective effect and mechanism of effective components in Chinese yam [22]. The cell polarity and tight junction of human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2 cells) are similar to small intestinal epithelial cells, which can be used\nNutrients 2023, 15, 883 12 of 17\nto effectively study the expression of inflammatory factors [33]. Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways are three important inflammatory signaling pathways in cells [34]. Besides, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) can activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and NF-\u03baB through tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 to promote inflammation, while research on TNF-\u03b1 directly activating JAK-STAT pathway has not been reported. Based on the preliminary anti-inflammatory mechanism of 6,7-dihydroxy-2,4-dimethoxyphenan- threne (PC4), the prediction and confirmation of inflammatory targets were focused on NF-\u03baB/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) are the most common inflammatory factors [25] and our results showed that the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 in inflammatory Caco-2 cells model group were higher than those in the control group, indicating that TNF-\u03b1 successfully induced cellular inflammatory response. TNF-\u03b1 is considered to aggravate the severity of inflammatory response and damage to gastrointestinal tissue and mucosa [35], which has remarkable impact on the prognosis. Moreover, IL-8 can activate neutrophils and promote their migration into the blood [36]. Its content is positively correlated with the severity of inflammation, which can be used as a reliable index to evaluate the illness degree of ulcerative colitis. From our previous research, phenanthrene compounds 1~4 exhibited higher COX-2 inhibition than positive control aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen. This research further verified the binding of PC4 with COX-2 by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. Molecular docking technology possesses apparent advantages in active ingredients-pharmacological targets research and has been widely used in the discovery, development and efficacy mechanism of active ingredients. Compared with 6-hydroxy2,4,7-trimethoxyphenanthrene (PC2), PC4 had stronger interaction with COX-2 due to the formation of a hydrogen bond at Tyr385 residue. Interestingly, it has been experimentally validated that the phenolic oxygen of Tyr385 plays a crucial role in abstracting hydrogen from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonate substrates [37]. Therefore, Tyr385 is considered as a well-established catalytic site in COX reactions [38]. The molecular docking results of Meshram et al. also showed that Tyr385 was a crucial hydrogen bond binding site between a variety of small bioactive substances and COX-2 [27]. Therefore, combined with the molecular dynamics simulation analysis of this study, it was proved that Tyr385 played an important role in PC4-mediated COX-2 inhibition. Residues of Val349, Ala527 and Leu534 were the hydrophobic binding sites of PC4 and COX-2 protein, which exhibited non-negligible effects. Under pathological conditions, the gene expression of COX-2 increases several times, thus responding to proinflammatory factors quickly. Simultaneously, gene silencing is considered to be an effective method to screen drug targets. COX-2 was predicted as the target of PC4 through molecular docking results in this experiment. To further confirm this conclusion, protein changes in NF-\u03baB/COX-2 pathway were analyzed after silencing COX-2 gene in Caco-2 cells. NF-\u03baB plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory response. Nuclear factor kappa-B inhibitor alpha (I\u03baB\u03b1) is known as an inactive inhibitor protein of NF-\u03baB p50/NF\u03baB p65 heterodimer and the combination of I\u03baB\u03b1 and dimer is localized in the cytoplasm. After degradation of inhibitor protein, the activated dimer enters the nucleus and immediately starts the transcription of downstream inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-8 and COX-2 [39]. In recent years, multiple natural compounds that can inhibit NF-\u03baB pathway have been reported to control the health threat of NF-\u03baB in organisms. The main pathways by which they inhibit NF-\u03baB are as follows: (1) reducing the formation of NF-\u03baB activator as antioxidants; (2) inhibiting I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation; (3) reducing protease activity, thereby inhibiting Rel/NF-\u03baB [40,41]. Yuan et al. reported the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge on NF-\u03baB pathway, which indicated that dihydrotanshinone blocked the dimerization of Toll-like receptors 4 to form myeloid differentiation primary response 88 and activated TGF-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB and\nNutrients 2023, 15, 883 13 of 17\nMAPK pathways [42]. As a phytochemical compound, PC4 can inhibit NF-\u03baB/COX-2 pathway, while the mechanism by which PC4 regulates NF-\u03baB is still unclear so far. Phosphorylated protein can better reflect the activity of protein in cells. This study found that there was no significant change in the expression levels of pIkB\u03b1 and pNF-\u03baB protein in COX-2 gene silenced cells regardless of whether PC4 was added or not, indicating that PC4 as COX-2 enzyme inhibitor did not act on the IkB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB targets directly. COX-2 is the key enzyme which inhibits the formation of PGs. Meanwhile, ulcerative colitis is a chronic nonspecific inflammation. Studies have confirmed that prostaglandins (PGs) existed in the positive feedback loop of chronic diseases [18], which generated a positive feedback loop through COX-2, prostaglandin E2, E-series of prostaglandin receptors type 2 (EP2) and NF-\u03baB to amplify inflammatory signals [18,28]. This explained the phenomenon that the protein levels of pIkB\u03b1, pNF-\u03baB and pERK1/2 in the upstream were also changed after PC4 acted on COX-2 enzyme. Aoki et al. [43] observed that the occurrence of intracranial aneurysm (IA) was induced by COX-2 in the IA model. They further found that EP2 was up-regulated at the IA site and the signal pathway was inhibited of in mice with IA lacking EP2. Activated NF-\u03baB induced various inflammation related genes, hence inhibition of COX-2 to block EP2 expression and knockout of EP2 to inhibit COX-2 induction in IA, both inhibited NF-\u03baB activation and then inhibited COX-2 expression. This suggested that the inflammatory therapeutic value of PC4 contributed to its inhibition of the positive feedback loop of NF-\u03baB/COX-2. In addition, PGs catalyzed by COX-2 enzyme could regulate the expression of IL-8 [44]. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 are not only NF\u03baB inflammatory pathway inducers, but also downstream effectors. This indicated that PC4 might down-regulate the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 after inhibiting the COX-2 enzyme, thereby reducing the initial inducers of inflammatory pathway and finally inhibiting the whole inflammatory process. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of PC4 on NF-\u03baB/COX-2 pathway is summarized in Figure 8. As a member of MAPK pathway, ERK 1/2 is the upstream kinase of NF-\u03baB protein [17], which plays an important role in regulating the stress inflammatory response, proliferation and differentiation of gastric mucosal epithelium. Phosphorylated ERK can transmit extracellular signals to the nucleus. The study by Kundu et al. showed that COX-2 enzyme was closely related to MAPK pathway and green tea polyphenols inhibited the catalytic activity of ERK, suggesting that ERK may be a potential target of polyphenol antitumor activity [45]. The level of pERK 1/2 was also analyzed in this experiment. However, it was found that the target of PC4 was not pERK1/2, but the downstream COX-2 protease, which was different from the conclusion of Kundu et al. In general, from the perspective of molecular groups, the phenolic oxygen of Tyr385 had been experimentally validated to play a vital role of abstracting the 13-proS hydrogen from EPA and arachidonate substrates [37]. That is to say, when PC4 and Tyr385 on COX-2 were combined by hydrogen bonds, it might lead to the reduction of the sites on COX-2 enzyme that catalyze arachidonate substrates, thereby reducing the production of downstream inflammatory factor PGs and inhibiting inflammatory reaction. This provided molecular basis for COX-2 as a potential target for PC4 to alleviate inflammation. In addition, the actual combination of PC4 and COX-2 were also reflected in the in vitro experiments we had studied previously. The anti-inflammatory activity of PC2 and PC4 had been verified by the COX-2 enzyme inhibitory activity in vitro [21] and the cell activity experiment in this experiment. Our preliminary work had confirmed that PC4 alleviated DSS-induced intestinal mucosal injury in mice via modulation of the NF-\u03baB/COX-2 pathway [22]. Combining the results of molecular binding, actual binding and gene knockout, it is suggested that COX-2 was one of the targets of PC4 in alleviating ulcerative colitis.\nNutrients 2023, 15, 883 14 of 17\nNutrients 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 17\nCOX-2 enzyme, thereby reducing the initial inducers of inflammatory pathway and finally inhibiting the whole inflammatory process.

Firstly, the binding of bioactive compounds and protein targets was investigated only by a simulated method, which might not reflect their actual binding enough. Secondly, only the prediction and verification of the target of PC4 was carried out in the present research. However, PC4 might partly be digested and metabolized after entering the digestive tract and would participate in the metabolism of inflammatory pathways in the form of its metabolites. Therefore, isothermal titration calorimetry, drug affinity responsive target stability, microscalethermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance will be used to further confirm the actual binding of PC4 and the metabolites of PC4 in vivo and the mechanism in alleviating colitis will be further explored in the next step of our research."

            "text": "In summary, Chinese yam polyphenol PC4 could relieve intestinal inflammation as COX-2 inhibitor. Among the two active components of Chinese yam polyphenols, PC4 exhibited better anti-inflammatory activity and stronger molecular binding to COX-2, which was due to the role of the hydrogen bond between 7\u00b4 hydroxyl group of PC4 and Tyr385 residue of COX-2 protein. In addition, PC4 inhibited the protein expression of NF-\u03baB/COX-2 pathway in TNF-\u03b1-induced Caco-2 cells, but no significant difference had been observed for the pathway protein in COX-2 gene silenced cells. PC4 might realize its anti-inflammatory effect in Caco-2 cells by inhibiting COX-2 protease and inhibit the amplification of the initial inflammatory signal by the positive feedback loop to enhance the anti-inflammatory activity.
