Dealing with the high turnover rate in the IT industry makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the talent level required for those organizations to prosper. Fierce competition in the IT sector has led to a high turnover rate. Due to the rapid pace of technical breakthroughs and the ongoing evolution of the IT business, there is a significant demand for IT specialists. With such a high level of mobility in the workforce due to this demand, IT workers can readily explore new career prospects. Wilson and Furlonger also emphasized how employees may look for new challenges and greater pay due to technology\u2019s tendency to change quickly. On top of that, IT professionals are more than likely to leave their current job when they don\u2019t like the firm\u2019s working conditions. This has particularly become an issue in the COVID-19 era as more employees have transitioned to remote work, allowing them to manage their time on their own terms. The transition created an environment that has made attracting and retaining employees much more difficult. Thus, IT firms are constantly looking for effective strategies to attract and recruit new talent and retain their current employees. Organizations have experienced the positive and negative effects of this constant hunt for greater opportunities. It damages organizations that lose talent but benefits those that can attract talented workers. This new talent pool consists of first-time applicants and seasoned experts looking for new possibilities. As a result, businesses need to find strategies to draw in new employees and retain their current ones. In this study, the focus is on how companies draw in new employees. When assessing IT employers, IT professionals typically consider eight values. These eight values were identified through a content analysis of 26,460 new employee reviews. The employee reviews were written by recent hires who had been with their company for less than a year. The study tried to determine which values are most significant to these workers and make suggestions to IT companies on how to use employer brand value propositions to draw in and keep IT talent after COVID-19.",

It refers to developing and promoting an organization\u2019s distinctive image and reputation as an employer of choice. It encompasses a firm\u2019s efforts to communicate to existing and prospective staff members that it is a desirable workplace.2 Effective employer branding leads to luring top talent, enhancing employee engagement and retention, boosting organizational performance, and more. Employer branding refers to creating and maintaining an organization\u2019s reputation as an employer of choice.2,7,8 An organization does this by crafting a distinct identity that represents the organization\u2019s culture, values, and mission and showcasing this to potential employees, current employees, and the public. Employer branding is a strategic approach aimed at attracting and retaining top talent in a competitive job market by creating a positive image of the organization as a great workplace. This can include promoting the organization\u2019s employee benefits, perks, and development opportunities and highlighting its diversity and inclusion initiatives, social responsibility efforts, and workplace culture.\nEffective employer branding can result in higher levels of employee engagement, improved retention rates, and amore robust talent pipeline.1 It can also help organizations differentiate themselves from their competitors and position themselves as leaders in their industry.\nIn addition to the brand image an employer wishes to convey, there is the reality of what existing and future employees perceive about the employer.

Employees use technologies such as Web 2.012 in the form of electronic word-of-mouth on social media and online employer review sites to discuss work-related experiences across organizations, which changes the expectations and assessments of their workplace. IT firms must understand this new world of online employer branding to manage their public brand to attract new talent. As such, analyzing the perceptions and responses of first-year employees can be a valuable approach to identifying how well the intended brand perceptionmatches perceived reality.\nStudying the reactions and opinions of newly acquired IT talent, particularly first-year employees, is a vital endeavor that can offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of an organization\u2019s employer branding efforts and the alignment between employee expectations and actual experiences in the workplace. Research has shown that employees\u2019 initial impressions of an organization, formed through its reputation and employer branding, significantly influence their work environment expectations. Berthon et al.6 emphasized that effective employer branding shapes candidate perceptions and sets expectations for their workplace experiences. Investigating whether firstyear IT employees\u2019 initial impressions align with their experiences would provide a comprehensive understanding of the extent to which employer branding accurately portrays the organization\u2019s culture, values, and opportunities. By examining whether work environment expectations have been met, organizations can identify gaps, strengths, and areas for improvement in their onboarding and employer branding strategies. This research can enhance employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention, ultimately creating a positive and productive work environment that aligns with the expectations set through effective employer branding efforts, thereby contributing to employees\u2019 willingness to stay with the firm.3\nEMPLOYEE ACQUISITION, RETENTION, AND COVID-19\nCompanies face several obstacles when acquiring and retaining talent; IT companies are no exception. As discussed by Beechler andWoodward,5 these challenges are due to a combination of influencing factors related to the quantity, quality, and characteristics of said talent. These factors include global demographic and economic trends, increasing mobility of people and organizations, transformational changes to business environments, skills and cultures, and growing levels of workforce diversity.\nIn addition, the IT industry has other challenges, primarily due to the nature of the industry. The IT sector\nsuffers from a skill shortage,19 which is a global issue; competition for talent among employers; changing employee expectations, particularly after COVID-19; skill mismatch; job hopping, which is prevalent in the IT sector; heavy workload and its resulting burnout; and professional development.\nHigh demand for IT professionals is another challenge that has affected salaries and benefits packages by raising costs. As a result, small and medium-sized IT companies may need help to attract and retain top talent because they may not be able to offer the same level of compensation as larger companies. A Society for Human Resource Management16 study found that 83% of IT companies reported difficulty recruiting suitable candidates due to competition from other employers.\nIn addition to these challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic has produced other problems. Instead of face-to-face interactions and collaboration being the norm in traditional work environments, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid shift to remote work arrangements, challenging these established norms and expectations. In addition, employees\u2019 expectations have evolved to include greater flexibility, technologyenabled remote collaboration tools, and adaptability. These pandemic-induced changes accelerated the acceptance of virtual work environments, prompting organizations to modify their structures and policies to accommodate hybrid work models. The transition to remote work in response to the pandemic has significantly affected recruitment and retention efforts. Remote work may make retaining existing employees more challenging because they may feel isolated and less engaged with the organization. Remote work has also lifted limitations related to the need for physical proximity to the work location. As such, the competition for top talent has become more intense because geography is no longer a limiting factor.\nAlthough the challenge of increased competition for talent is due to high demand, as mentioned earlier, it should also be noted that the pandemic has added to these difficulties as organizations across industries have shifted to remote work, creating amore global talent pool. As a result, IT organizations face increased competition for talent from other organizations in the industry and different sectors.\nThese challenges highlight the need for IT organizations to adapt their recruitment and retention strategies in response to these postpandemic realities. This may include rethinking traditional recruitment methods, finding new ways to engage remote workers, and developing strategies to compete for talent in a more global market. This creates additional emphasis on each company\u2019s branding.\nSeptember/October 2023 IT Professional 5"

            "heading": "DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS",
            "text": "Glassdoor.com is an online labor market intermediary that allows its users to review companies they have worked for and their management anonymously.17 Glassdoor is currently the most popular company review site. As in previous academic studies, Glassdoor was used as a data source.17 Glassdoor\u2019s \u201cCompany Reviews\u201d section features six mandatory fields that reviewers complete. In addition, they are encouraged to enter text information, including \u201cpros\u201d (likes, praises) and \u201ccons\u201d (dislikes, complaints.) Glassdoor has a fivestar rating system for each company in the following categories: career opportunities, compensation and benefits, work\u2013life balance, senior management, culture and values, diversity and inclusion, and an overall rating. The diversity and inclusion rating is new (added after our initial study before COVID-19); therefore, before COVID-19, data on this issue were unavailable.\nSimilar to a previous study, Glassdoor.com was used10 to identify the 10 top IT firms that constantly scored with high ratings in the past five years (2017\u20132022) and the five IT firmswith the lowest ratings (see Table 1). Those companies were analyzed to understand the factors that IT employees care about in their evaluation of an employer brand. Glassdoor reports on the best and worst companies annually.\nData scraped using a web crawler for these companies included all positive and negative reviews, containing pros and cons. The resulting dataset featured 94,365 employee reviews. The reviews were split into two groups: before COVID-19 (1 January 2017\u201329 February 2020) and after COVID-19 (1 March 2020\u201331 December 2021). Of these 94,365 reviews, 73,456 were related to the top companies, with 31,235 reviews before COVID-19 and 42,221 after COVID-19. In addition, there were 20,909 reviews of bottom companies, with 8042 before COVID-19 and 12,867 after COVID-19. For this study, the data for new employees (those who worked in their respective workplaces for less than a year) were separated.\nSimilarly, these reviews by new employees were split into two groups, before and after COVID-19. Of the 26,460 reviews associated with new employees, 21,127 involved the top companies, further broken down into two sets: 4691 reviews before COVID-19 and 16,436 after COVID-19. The remaining 5333 reviews were about the bottom companies, again broken down into 1825 reviews before COVID-19 and 3508 after COVID-19. To effectively analyze this volume of data, the use of technology was necessary. The artificial intelligence engine IBM Watson Explorer uses natural language processing and deep learning to analyze text.11 It was used to analyze the data (the content of the collected reviews), developing a dictionary based on eight employer value propositions (Table 2) informed by the existing literature.3,4,6,7,8,20\nTable 3 demonstrates top- and bottom-rated IT companies\u2019 ratings before and after COVID-19. It is important to note that Glassdoor only requested responses covering five categories for new hires before COVID-19, but after COVID-19, Glassdoor added another category (diversity and inclusion). Therefore, there are no results available for this category before COVID-19. One result that can be easily observed is that employees\u2019 satisfaction with their work and their employer has increased overall and in every category for the bottom IT companies, even slightly higher when compared to our previous study results. However, this was not the case for the top companies. They showed a decline in every category analyzed, demonstrated by negative changes in their ratings. Therefore, the employees of the bottom-rated companies expressed more positivity after COVID-19 in almost every category and overall, in contrast to the top companies, which received more negative reviews after COVID-19. In addition, the \u201cCareer Opportunities (Development)\u201d category displayed the highest positive change (7%) among categories for the bottom companies. Conversely, it had the opposite outcome for the top companies, displaying the most significant negative change alongside the \u201cWork\u2013Life Balance\u201d category: a 4% decrease.\nTABLE 1. Glassdoor\u2019s top and bottom IT firms. (Source: Glassdoor.com.)\nIT Companies Top Adobe Apple Cisco Systems DocuSign Google LinkedIn Microsoft Nvidia Salesforce Zoom Video Communications Bottom Spectrum CDK Global CompuCom Frontier Communications Xerox\n6 IT Professional September/October 2023\nA total of 21,127 user reviews regarding the top companies and 4333 reviews for the bottom companies were analyzed. The results were grouped and classified based on the eight value propositions explained in this article and extensively in previous studies.8 Table 4 compiles the percentage calculations for the top and\nbottom companies, including praise and complaints, before and after COVID-19. The results are displayed in two sections. The values on the left side are based on the top-performing IT companies, and those on the right are based on the bottom-performing IT companies. In each section, the data have been split between praise\nand complaints, followed by a further breakdown of before COVID-19 (1 January 2017\u201329 February 2020) and after COVID-19 (1 March 2020\u201331 December 2021).\nAs expected, the results for the top and bottom companies differed. In addition to the percentages relevant to each value proposition, Table 4 displays the categories with the most significant changes (identified by different colors). They demonstrate the percentage of change observed for each value proposition category.\nAfter COVID-19, the most notable of these changes were related to the \u201cSocial\u201d and \u201cWork\u2013Life Balance\u201d categories and, to a lesser degree, the \u201cInterest\u201d and \u201cApplication\u201d categories. For top-performing companies, brand image slightly improved, with a 2% increase in praise. The rest of the categories regarding praise remained relatively similar. However, there were some significant changes in complaints. The \u201cSocial\u201d and \u201cWork\u2013Life Balance\u201d categories had the biggest shifts: 7% and 6%, respectively. That is, employees\u2019 complaints regarding the social aspect of their jobs was reduced by 7%. On the other hand, complaints increased by 6% regarding their work\u2013life balance, primarily due to the lack of separation of work from life. Other categories changed too, mainly the \u201cApplication\u201d and \u201cManagement\u201d categories, with an increase in complaints, versus the \u201cDevelopment\u201d and \u201cEconomical\u201d categories, which faced a decrease. For bottomperforming companies, praise increased for the \u201cEconomical\u201d category by 5%. The other category with a significant change was \u201cInterest,\u201d with a 4% decrease. The \u201cSocial\u201d category also changed but to a lesser degree, with a 2% decrease in praise. Not surprisingly, regarding complaints, the \u201cSocial\u201d category changed too, with a 4%decrease. This was themost significant change in complaints among the bottom-rated companies. Praise and complaints regarding the \u201cInterest\u201d category decreased. Other changes occurred in the \u201cApplication\u201d and \u201cWork\u2013Life Balance\u201d categories, with both having a 3% increase in complaints. The increase in work\u2013life balance complaints could indicate COVID-19\u2019s negative impact on employees. These changes could be attributed to the increased remote work and hybrid work structure. The work\u2013life balance value proposition similarly had a negative impact on the bottom companies.\nTo summarize, for the top-performing companies, the most significant changes involved the value propositions of social and work\u2013life balance, with the former being affected positively with fewer complaints and the latter negatively with increased complaints. On the other hand, the bottom-performing companies had increased praise for the \u201cEconomical\u201d category and decreased praise for the \u201cInterest\u201d category, followed by a decrease in social complaints.TA B LE 4 .

These changes should be studied and analyzed in more detail because companies need to be sensitive to employees\u2019 shifting expectations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the IT industry and its workforce, reshaping employees\u2019 attitudes, and expectations and subsequently influencing their employers. Remote work became a norm, causing a paradigm shift in how IT professionals view their jobs and workplaces. Many employees have experienced the benefits of remote work and have developed a preference for flexible work arrangements that offer a better work\u2013life balance. Additionally, the pandemic underscored the importance of job security, with many people facing uncertainties in the jobmarket.\nREFERENCES 1. T. Ambler and S.
