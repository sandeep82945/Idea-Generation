1. **Investigate the role of narratives in shaping individual consumption behaviors and lifestyles, particularly in the context of agri-food systems.** How do narratives influence consumers' perceptions of food, their choices, and their willingness to adopt more sustainable consumption practices?


2. **Explore the potential of human-nature interdependence narratives to promote sustainable consumption and foster sufficient lifestyles.** How can narratives that emphasize the interconnectedness between humans and the natural world inspire individuals to make more environmentally conscious choices?


3. **Examine the role of the Circular Economy (CE) narrative in addressing overconsumption and promoting sustainable consumption patterns.** How can the CE narrative be reframed to emphasize the importance of individual behavioral change and challenge the prevailing eco-modernist discourse?


4. **Investigate the role of agricultural and food economists in co-creating narratives that challenge overconsumption and promote sufficient lifestyles.** How can economists contribute to the development of narratives that resonate with consumers and policymakers, and how can they integrate more complex approaches to consumer behavior and human relationships with the natural world into their research?


5. **Explore the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration between social sciences, environmental humanities, and economics in developing comprehensive narratives for sustainable consumption.** How can diverse theoretical approaches, methodologies, and value considerations be combined to create narratives that are both compelling and effective in promoting sustainable consumption practices?
