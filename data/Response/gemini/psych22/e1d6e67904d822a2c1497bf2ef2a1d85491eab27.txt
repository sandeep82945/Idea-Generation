1. **Investigate the effectiveness of Mum2BMoodBooster in a larger, randomized controlled trial (RCT).** This would provide more robust evidence of the program's efficacy and help to identify the women who are most likely to benefit from it.
2. **Examine the long-term effects of Mum2BMoodBooster.** Do the benefits of the program persist after treatment is completed? How does the program affect the mental health of women and their children in the years following pregnancy?
3. **Explore the use of Mum2BMoodBooster in different populations.** Can the program be adapted for use with women from different cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds? Is it effective for women with different types of mental health problems, such as anxiety or postpartum depression?
4. **Develop a self-guided version of Mum2BMoodBooster.** This would make the program more accessible to women who do not have access to a coach or who prefer to work through the program at their own pace.
5. **Investigate the use of Mum2BMoodBooster as a preventive intervention.** Can the program help to prevent depression in women who are at risk for developing the condition during pregnancy?
