 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further investigate the mechanism of action of ANP0903 and its liposomal formulation. The paper suggests proteasome inhibition as a likely mechanism, but more studies could confirm this and elucidate the specific details. 

2. Test the efficacy of liposomal ANP0903 in animal models of hepatocellular carcinoma. This would provide important preclinical data and help determine optimal dosing/administration before human trials.

3. Explore modifications or optimizations of the liposomal formulation to further improve drug delivery and antitumor effects. This could include tweaking the lipid composition, adding targeting ligands, or developing a thermosensitive formulation.

4. Evaluate the potential of liposomal ANP0903 to overcome drug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma. Many therapies lose effectiveness over time due to resistance, so testing if this formulation can bypass common resistance mechanisms would be useful.

5. Investigate combination therapies with liposomal ANP0903 and other drugs/modalities like immunotherapy or radiotherapy. Combination regimens are often more effective than single agents, so finding synergistic combinations could improve treatment outcomes.
