EPs exhibit a significant increase in the abundance of 26 genera, including Streptococcus, Granulicatella, and Kluyvera, while the abundance of 14 genera, including Peptostreptococcus, Neisseria, and Schaalia, is significantly reduced. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of oral microbial markers in the training cohort and validation cohort was 98.85% and 97.23%, respectively. Importantly, the AUC of the biomarker set achieved 92.44% of additional independent validation sets. In addition, EPRs also have their own unique oral community.\nConclusion: This study describes the characterization of the oral microbiome in EP and EPR and demonstrates the potential of the specific microbiome as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for epilepsy.\nKEYWORDS\nepilepsy, seizure control, oral microbiome, diagnostic model, receiver operating characteristic curve\n1 Introduction\nEpilepsy is a chronic, non-communicable disease that affects people of all ages, with approximately 5 million people globally diagnosed with this neurological disorder each year (World Health Organization, 2019). There is no single, simple, and reliable diagnostic method for epilepsy, and a complete history and reliable eyewitness accounts are key to diagnosis (Thijs et\u00a0al., 2019). In addition, polymorphisms in epilepsy-related genes and social and economic factors complicate diagnosis. The interval from the first seizure to a well-defined seizure can"

Unfortunately, delayed treatment and misdiagnosis of epilepsy are not uncommon and potentially devastating (Firkin et\u00a0 al., 2015; Xu et\u00a0al., 2016).\nGut microbes and the brain communicate with each other via vagus nerve activation, endocrine and immune response regulation, and microbial metabolite production (Amlerova et\u00a0 al., 2021). Neurological and psychiatric disorders occur when changes such as genetic polymorphisms, environmental stimuli, dietary changes, and gastrointestinal disorders affect the brain-gut axis (Walker et\u00a0 al., 2020). For example, animal studies by Olson et\u00a0 al. (2018) clearly showed that specific intestinal flora mediates the antiepileptic effects of a ketogenic diet. Several human studies have shown that the composition of the intestinal microbiota in people with refractory epilepsy is altered compared with that of healthy people (Peng et\u00a0al., 2018; Gong et\u00a0al., 2020; Holmes et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThe oral microbiome is a microbiome library that continuously supplements the gut microbiome, and at least one-third of oral microbiome cells enter the intestinal tract of healthy people through the digestive tract (Iwauchi et\u00a0al., 2019; Schmidt et\u00a0al., 2019). A 16S rRNA gene sequencing study based on 27 children with cerebral palsy and epilepsy showed a clear correlation between intestinal and oral microbiota (Huang et\u00a0al., 2022). This reflects the importance of oral microbiota in epilepsy. In addition, oral microorganisms and their products may also enter the brain through the systemic circulation or peripheral nerves (Horowitz et\u00a0al., 2004; Kook et\u00a0al., 2014). However, the characteristics of the oral microbiota in patients with epilepsy remain unclear.\nBased on the results of previous intestinal microbiota, we\u00a0 attempted to further reveal changes in the oral microbiota in epilepsy patients using a large cohort and identify related biomarkers. We\u00a0hope that the exploration of oral microbiota will provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy."

Before tongue swab samples are taken, a general oral examination is performed by the dental hygienist in the physical examination department through probing, percussion, palpation, and looseness. Its content includes (World Health Organization, 2019) observing the integrity and symmetry of the maxillofacial region and whether there are developmental malformations (Thijs et\u00a0al., 2019); checking all teeth for caries and defects (Firkin et\u00a0al., 2015); checking the oral mucosa and tongue for ulcer, cracked tongue, and lichen planus (Jallon et\u00a0 al., 2001); checking the growth of impacted teeth and whether it harms adjacent teeth or other tissues (Xu et\u00a0al., 2016); checking whether there are lumps in the oral cavity and whether there are abnormal conditions such as leukoplakia.

Under the premise of sufficient sample size and sequencing data for both groups (Figure\u00a0 6A; Supplementary Figure S1A), alpha diversity suggested higher oral microbial diversity for EPR than HC (Figure\u00a0 6A; Supplementary Figure S1B; Supplementary Table S10). PCoA showed that the two groups had different microbial communities (Figure\u00a06B; Supplementary Figure S1C).

LEfSe further screened out microorganisms closely related to intergroup differences (p < 0.05, LDA >3) (Figure\u00a0 6E; Supplementary Table S16). Compared with HC, 9 metabolic pathways (e.g., bacterial chemotaxis, synthesis, and degradation of ketone bodies, and benzoate degradation) were active in EPR, while 12 metabolic pathways were less active (Supplementary Figure S1F; Supplementary Table S17).\nThrough a 5-fold cross-validation analysis of the key OTUs, we\u00a0obtained the best tag set that could accurately distinguish the two groups (Supplementary Figures S1I,J).

In the study by Gong et\u00a0 al. (2021), this is similar to the alpha diversity of intestinal microflora for children with refractory epilepsy treated with a ketogenic diet. However Peng et\u00a0 al. (2018), found no significant difference in alpha diversity of the intestinal microflora in drugsensitive epilepsy compared with a healthy state.\nCompared with HC, the relative abundance of Streptococcus and Leptotrichia in EP increased, while the relative abundance of Neisseria, Haemophilus, Rothia, and Schaalia decreased. However, the relative abundance of Streptococcus in EPR still increased after seizure control compared with HC. In a retrospective analysis of 145 children with central nervous system infections, the cerebrospinal fluid culture of 26.1% of infected patients showed the presence of Group B Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Lin et\u00a0al., 2019). The growth of Streptococcus in the gut affects the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Jiang et\u00a0al., 2015) and contributes to neurodegenerative diseases by inducing neuroinflammation (Huang et\u00a0al., 2019). As normal oropharyngeal flora, commensal Neisseria may affect the colonization of potential pathogens (Dorey et\u00a0al., 2019). The relative abundance of Schaalia in EPR returned to normal levels. Schaalia is one of the oral bacteria that produce nitrite (Sato-Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2020), which has antibacterial activity and the ability to improve systemic blood circulation (Lundberg and Weitzberg, 2010). The relative abundance of Kluyvera and Lautropia in the EPR was not restored. Kluyvera is mainly colonized in the respiratory tract, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal tract (Braunstein et\u00a0al., 1980). Although it\nhas not been reported to infect the central nervous system, there have been some cases of blood infection (Linares et\u00a0 al., 2000). These microorganisms may be\u00a0a preferred target for intervention therapy in epilepsy. We\u00a0think that the return to normal levels of flora may play an important role in epileptic seizures. The presence of flora that remains at abnormal levels suggests that there may still be\u00a0an inherent pathogenic biochemical basis for EPR.\nAntiepileptic drugs can affect the composition of gut microbiota, thereby regulating the metabolism of central neurotransmitters (Lum et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2022). The oral microbiome in this study changed after seizure control, which may be\u00a0 due to the direct effect of antiepileptic drugs. However, oral microbiota may also change after seizure control under the combined effects of reduced stress and immune system regulation, which needs to be\u00a0further explored and confirmed by long-term longitudinal studies. Genomic technologies have significantly broadened our understanding of the role of oral microbes in different diseases (Sun et\u00a0al., 2022). Specific sets of oral microbiotas have been shown to have strong diagnostic power in novel coronavirus (Ren et\u00a0al., 2021), autoimmune hepatitis (Rao et\u00a0al., 2021), rheumatoid arthritis (Zhang et\u00a0 al., 2015), systemic lupus erythematosus (Guo et\u00a0al., 2023), cholangiocarcinoma (Rao et\u00a0al., 2022), lung cancer (Sun et\u00a0al., 2023), and colorectal cancer (Flemer et\u00a0al., 2018). We\u00a0used random forest analysis to construct relevant biomarkers based on oral microbes and validated the diagnostic efficacy of the model with a randomized cohort. This diagnostic model will be\u00a0helpful for early screening or diagnosis of epilepsy, especially when the diagnosis of epilepsy is not clear, and it may be\u00a0an important\nFIGURE\u00a07 Microecological differences before and after seizure control.

Since we\u00a0included epileptic seizure control subjects who were seizure-free in a short period of time, further study on patients who have recovered is needed.\nThis study has some limitations. Although cost-effective 16S rRNA gene sequencing is expected to increase the utility of disease diagnostic models, it cannot capture information about fungi and viruses, as well as metagenomics. In addition, the oral microbiota is susceptible to various factors; while this study validated the established biomarkers with an independent cohort recruited at different time points, additional external cohorts from diverse regions are necessary for future validation. The patients with epilepsy who were recruited in our study were those who had received an initial clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. However, due to the polymorphism and concealment of epilepsy, it is also possible that the disease state of epilepsy itself has existed for some time. In addition, the status of disease persistence reflects the progression of the disease, which may affect the study results. However, the large cohort and the clinical selection of patients with an initial diagnosis of epilepsy minimized this effect. In future, the effect of epilepsy duration on oral microbiota needs to be\u00a0further explored.\nIn conclusion, based on tongue coat microflora analysis, this study identified changes in oral microflora among EP, EPR, and HC and constructed biomarkers for each condition. It is important to note that the specific oral microflora reflect the changes and characteristics of the disease in different states of epilepsy and seizure control."
