Low cost, high sensitivity and quick response time 41 makes the sensors based on metal oxide semiconductors very attractive. Bis42 muth oxide is environmental friendly and are known to show good sensitivity 43 with a large number of gases like CO2, NO2 and NO Bhande et al (2011); 44 Gou et al (2009); Cabot et al (2004).\n45 46 Metal oxide semiconductor based sensors mainly work by adsorption and 47 desorption of gas on the surface causing a change in their electrical resistance 48 Fine et al (2010); Seiyama et al (1962). Thus a large surface area is highly 49 desirable for a good sensor. Nanostructures provides an ideal way of achieving 50 this and their morphology has a direct impact on the gas sensing behaviour 51 of the material Gurlo (2011).

Ro is the resistance of sample in presence of air while Rg is the resistance in presence of CO2 gas. These measurements were initially carried out at 90 psi CO2 pressure for 50\u25e6 C, 75\u25e6 C and 100\u25e6 C (figure 6). At first, CO2 gas was flushed trough the chamber to remove the air present in the chamber. The output valve was then closed and the required CO2 pressure was built up (indicated by CO2 ON). In the third step (indicated by CO2 OFF), inlet valve was closed and the outlet valve was opened to release the CO2 pressure. Percentage response of 0%, 15.5% and 276.8 % was seen at 50\u25e6 C, 75\u25e6 C and 100\u25e6 C respectively.\n8 CO2 gas sensing properties of Na3BiO4 - Bi2O3 mixed oxide nanostructures\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\nEffect of variation in CO2 pressure was further evaluated at different pres- sures and at a fixed temperature of 100\u25e6 C. Figure 7 (a), (b) and (c) shows the percentage response curve for 90 psi, 60 psi and 30 psi CO2 pressures respec- tively at 100\u25e6 C. Comparison of response time at different pressures is shown in figure 8.

Response time increases (250 ms at 90 psi, 500 ms at 60 psi & 650 ms at 30 psi) while recovery time decreases (78 s at 90 psi, 53.5 s at 60 psi & 24.5 s at 30 psi) as the pressure is decreased from 90 psi to 30 psi This may be due to deeper adsorption of gas molecules at higher pressures. Bi2O3 nanoplates prepared by the similar route do not show significant percentage response (3.5 % at 100\u25e6 C and 90 psi gas pressure) while ITO substrate shows no sensitivity at all. To further analyze the relationship between CO2 pressure and percentage response, a linear fit is plotted (figure 9). A sensitivity of 3.2 %/psi is seen (R2 = 0.94).\nCO2 gas sensing properties of Na3BiO4 - Bi2O3 mixed oxide nanostructures 11\n137\n138\n139\n140\nRepeatability studies are shown in figure 10 for 90 psi pressure.

An almost instantaneous decrease in resistance is seen on exposure to CO2 gas.\nWhen the heated metal oxide nanoplates are exposed to air, oxygen gets adsorbed on the surface. At temperatures < 150\u25e6 C, oxygen is predominantly adsorbed as O2\u2212 Ranwa et al (2014). The detailed mechanism can be explained with the help of following equations:\nO2 (air) \u2212\u2192 O2 (adsorbed)\n(1)\nO2 (adsorbed) + 2e\u2212\u2212\u2192 2O2\u2212\n(2)\n148\n149\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n155\nIn this process, oxygen takes up electrons from the conduction band. This leads to the formation of an electron depletion layer for an n-type material or a hole accumulation layer for a p-type material. When an oxidizing gas like CO2 gas is introduced on to a n-type metal oxide semiconductor surface, the gas molecules gets adsorbed onto the surface of the material by taking up free electrons. The mechanism of CO2 adsorption can be understood with the help of following equations Bhande et al (2011):\nCO2 gas sensing properties of Na3BiO4 - Bi2O3 mixed oxide nanostructures 13\nCO2 \u2212\u2192 CO + O (3)\nO + 2e\u2212 \u2212\u2192 O2\u2212 (4)\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n167\n168\nCO2 breaks up into CO and O on surface interaction. The oxygen atoms released takes up electrons from the surface forming O2\u2212. This causes a further expansion of electron depletion layer which in turn causes a decrease in conductivity. However when a p-type material is involved, CO2 causes an expansion of hole accumulation layer thereby causing an increase in conduc- tivity or decrease in resistance Hung et al (2017).\nIn the present work, a significant decrease in resistance is observed for Na3BiO4 - Bi2O3 mixed oxide nanoplates on introduction of CO2 gas (figure 11). This suggests that this material is behaving as a strong p-type semicon- ductor (figure 12). Nanoplates offer a very large surface area leading to good adsorption. Results suggests that this adsorption is reversible and the original conductivity of the material is restored after the gas is removed.\n169\n170\n171\n172\n173\n174\n175\n176\n177\n178\n179\n180\n181\n182\n183\n184\n185\n186\n187\n188\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\n196\n197\n198\n199\n200\n201\n202\n203\n204\n205\n206\n207\n208\n14 CO2 gas sensing properties of Na3BiO4 - Bi2O3 mixed oxide nanostructures"

            "text": "Na3BiO4 - Bi2O3 mixed oxide nanostructures have been synthesized using potentiostatic electrodeposition. XRD analysis shows peaks corrsponding to monoclinic Na3BiO4 and Bi2O3 with weight percentage of 20 % and 80 % respectively. SEM studies reveals the presence of horizontally aligned nanoplates with thickness ranging from 40 nm to 75 nm. The percentage response shows a linear dependance on pressure in the range 0 psi to 90 psi and 100\u25e6 C (R2 = 0.94). A sensitivity of 3.2 %/psi is observed. These mixed oxide nanoplates shows a very quick response to CO2 gas, which is a highly sought after characteristic for a gas sensor. Repeatability and stability makes this material an ideal candidate for sensor development.\nAcknowledgments.
