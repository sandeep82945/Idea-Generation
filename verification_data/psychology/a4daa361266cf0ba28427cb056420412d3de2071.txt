The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is:

"The observed dynamic behavior of the particular aptitude for the transfer of H, by keeping the metallic scaffold, might suggest further tailored catalytic processes, such as isomerization, as in the case of the chelate homoleptic k2(O,O)- species [13] or novel insight into therapeutic antitumor agents for the versatile heteroleptic k2(N,O) compounds [3]."
