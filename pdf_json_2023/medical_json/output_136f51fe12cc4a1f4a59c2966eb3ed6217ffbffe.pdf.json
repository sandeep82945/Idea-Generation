    "abstractText": "Background: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is often treated with a mFOLFOX6 regimen. The 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) bolus is often omitted from the regimen to reduce the risk of hematological adverse events (AEs) in patients with poor performance status. We aimed to investigate the incidence of hematological AEs in Asian patients with mCRC who were treated with the mFOLFOX6 with and without 5-FU bolus dosing. Methods: This retrospective chart review was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand from June 2021 to June 2022. The primary endpoints were hematological AEs. Secondary endpoints were any AEs. The comparison of continuous data was conducted with an independent t-test. The Chi-squared test was used to compare categorical data. Results: From 110 patients, we found that hematological and non-hematological AEs of any grade in the two groups were not significantly different. However, patients in the bolus arm had a significantly lower absolute neutrophil count (ANC) than those in the non-bolus arm (mean difference = 43.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 20.74, 65.51), P-value = 0.0002). A subgroup analysis in patients who received first-line treatment with mFOLFOX6 showed that the bolus arm had a significantly lower ANC (mean difference = 46.01 (95% CI: 19.99, 72.03), P-value = 0.0007). Conclusions: mCRC patients who were treated with bolus 5-FU had lower ANC. The 5-FU bolus omission from the mFOLFOX6 regimen may be required in patients with a high risk of neutropenia.",

            "text": "In 2022, colorectal cancer was ranked as the third highest cause of death in the United States of America. In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), the 5-year survival rate was approximately 15% [1]. The treatment of mCRC consists of chemotherapy as a core component and targeted therapy, e.g., anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted agents, which can prolong patient life expectancy, as an adjunct [2-4]. The 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy regimens have been used for the treatment of mCRC for decades [5]. Adding oxaliplatin or irinotecan to the chemotherapy regimen can enhance both efficacy progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [6-8]. The most widely used formula for the treatment of mCRC patients is mFOLFOX6 (5-FU, leucovorin (LV), oxaliplatin). This regimen is followed by 5-FU 400 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) injection bolus administered over 5 min and 5-FU 2,400 mg/m2 IV administered as a continuous infusion over 46 h. Each cycle is repeated every 2 weeks [9].\nThe differences in the 5-FU administration, as IV bolus or continuous infusion, result in different mechanisms of action of 5-FU. The bolus infusion of 5-FU leads to the high plasma concentration of 5-FU and its metabolites. This allows fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (FdUTP) and fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP), 5-FU active metabolites, to be incorporated directly into the DNA and RNA of cancer cells [10]. However, the continuous infusion of 5-FU renders the inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS) by fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), which is one of 5-FU\u2019s active metabolites, in the S-phase of the cell cycle to predominate. It has been long known that 5-FU continuous infusion is more effective for the treatment of colorectal cancer than 5-FU bolus injection [11]. In addition, the pattern of 5-FU toxicity is different with each mode of administration. The 5-FU bolus injection is more associated with hematological toxicity while 5-FU continuous Manuscript submitted July 27, 2023, accepted August 30, 2023 Published online September 20, 2023 aDepartment of Pharmacy Practice, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand bDivision of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Burapha University, Chonburi, Thailand cCorresponding Author: Bannawich Sapapsap, Division of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Burapha University, Chonburi 20131, Thailand.

Genes that play roles in 5-FU toxicity include DPYD (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase), TYMS (thymidylate synthase), and UTG1A1 (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) [15]. These gene alleles are different in different human races, affecting the toxicity of 5-FU differently in each race [15]. In clinical practice, 5-FU is usually administered as a continuous infusion. The 5-FU bolus injection is usually avoided to reduce the risk of hematological adverse events (AEs), especially in the elderly or patients with poor performance status [16, 17].\nCurrently, there is no evidence-based recommendation for whether 5-FU bolus should be incorporated into the treatment of colorectal cancer, and such a decision is mainly based on individual judgment [16]. Although a previous study has confirmed that not using 5-FU bolus significantly reduces the incidence of neutropenia in any grade, there were some limitations in its applicability such as insufficient sample size and lack of an Asian population [17]. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the incidence of hematological AEs in Asian patients who were treated with the mFOLFOX6 regimen with and without 5-FU bolus injection."

Data were collected using case record form (CRF). The primary endpoints were hematological AEs including neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Secondary endpoints were any AEs.

Descriptive statistics were used to present patient characteristics and presented as frequency and percentage. The independent t-test was used to compare continuous data between cases and controls and the differences were presented as mean differences. The Chi-squared test was used to compare categorical data in case and control groups and the differences were presented as odds ratios. The statistical analysis was two-sided, with an alpha value of 0.05. The sample size was calculated based on a formula [19]: n = (Z\u03b1/2 + Z\u03b2)2 \u00d7 (P1(1 - P1) + P2(1 - P2))/ (P1 - P2)2 where P, the true response probability, was derived from Basilio et al [17]. The sample size was set to be at least 94 to achieve the alpha of 0.05 and the power of 0.80. A priori subgroup analysis for primary and secondary endpoints in the patient who receives first-line treatment with mFOLFOX6 was also performed.\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (0222/66). The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical standards of the responsible institution on human subjects as well as with the Helsinki Declaration."

In addition, the cumulative doses of LV and oxaliplatin were significantly higher in the bolus arm. In clinical practice, 5-FU bolus injection is usually avoided to reduce the risk of hematological AEs, especially in the elderly or patients with poor performance status [16]. In addition, sometimes patients with poor performance status also received a reduced dose of LV and oxaliplatin [16, 17]. Not receiving 5-FU bolus and receiving a reduced dose of LV and oxaliplatin might cause the higher mean average ANC at the second cycle in the non-bolus arm.\nHematological AEs of any grade were not significantly different between the two groups. Patients in the bolus arm were more likely to have grade 3/4 hematological AEs than those in the non-bolus arm, although this was not significant. We also found that the bolus arm had a significantly lower ANC than the non-bolus arm. The lower ANC in patients in the bolus arm might be because of previous exposure to chemotherapy (second line 23.8% in the bolus arm versus 10.0% in the non-bolus arm, P = 0.1790). We performed a subgroup analysis in chemotherapy naive patients who re-\nArticles \u00a9 The authors | Journal compilation \u00a9 World J Oncol and Elmer Press Inc\u2122 | www.wjon.org 395\nceived mFOLFOX6 as the first-line treatment to eliminate the effect of the previous cycle of chemotherapy and to minimize the effect of performance status, which was not known in our study.

However, hematological AEs of any grade were still\nnot significantly different between the two groups after the subgroup analysis.\nNon-hematological AEs were not significantly different between the two groups.

Hand-foot syndrome and peripheral neuropathy were not found in this study since it takes several months to occur [20, 21]. In our study, we collected the data from the second cycle which was 14 days after the treatment.\nOur patient\u2019s characteristics were similar to that of Basil-\nArticles \u00a9 The authors | Journal compilation \u00a9 World J Oncol and Elmer Press Inc\u2122 | www.wjon.org398\nio et al, with the majority of patients in the bolus arm having single-site metastasis at the liver, while patients in the non-bolus arm had a similar number of single-site metastasis and multiple-site metastasis. Most patients in both groups received chemotherapy as first-line treatment. The main difference between this study and the study by Basilio et al, was that we collected data from Thai people, but that study was conducted in the US population. In addition, although neutropenia was not statistically different between the two arms, patients in the bolus arm were more likely to have neutropenia. Basilio et al [17] and Yoshida et al [22] also showed that patients who were treated with 5-FU bolus had a higher incidence of neutropenia. In this study, the numbers of ANC in cycle two in patients in the non-bolus arm were higher than in the bolus arm, agreeing with a study in a Japanese population by Ueda et al [23].\nThis study had some limitations worth mentioning. First, the recruited patients had different baseline characteristics. Patients in the non-bolus arm were older and had lower BSA. This was expected since in the real world, 5-FU bolus injection is usually avoided to reduce the risk of hematological AEs in the elderly or poor performance status [16, 17]. In this study, patients who were in the bolus arm were younger and had higher BSA. However, we found that they had lower ANC. Since the confounding in this study was toward the null, we\nbelieved that our result was valid. Second, we could not retrieve the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of the participants since this was the limitation of the hospital database. To minimize the effect of this limitation, we did a subgroup analysis in a patient who received mFOLFOX6 as the first line, assuming that chemotherapeutic naive patients still had good performance status. Third, the sample size in this study was small. Larger randomized controlled trials or well-designed large observational studies should be conducted to further ensure the incidence of hematological AEs in Asian patients who were treated with the mFOLFOX6 regimen with and without 5-FU bolus injection."
