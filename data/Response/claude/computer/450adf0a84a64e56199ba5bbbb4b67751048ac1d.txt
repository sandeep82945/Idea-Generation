 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Investigate more complex and heterogeneous IoT environments with a larger number of nodes and more diverse types of sensors. The current evaluation was done on relatively small datasets from simulated or controlled environments. Testing the architecture on larger real-world deployments could reveal new challenges.

2. Explore the use of different machine learning models beyond RF, SVM and MLP. Models like XGBoost or convolutional neural networks may provide better accuracy or efficiency for anomaly detection. Ensemble methods combining multiple models could also be beneficial.

3. Consider the integration of explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide explanations for the anomaly classifications made by the models. This could increase trust and transparency in the system.

4. Study the effects of concept drift in the IoT environments over time and how the models could be efficiently retrained to adapt to changing conditions. Lifelong learning approaches could be relevant here.

5. Investigate privacy-preserving techniques like federated learning to train models in a decentralized manner without compromising user data privacy. This could alleviate concerns around data collection in IoT environments.
