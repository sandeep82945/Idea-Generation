            "text": "Since the seminal work of Arduengo in 1991 disclosing stable N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs),1 NHCs have attracted much attention in particular for their use as ancillary ligands in organometallic chemistry.2 Their electronic properties (strong \u03c3-donation and poor \u03c0-acceptor characteristics) make them more than simple phosphine mimics and allow the synthesis of a myriad of well-defined transition metal complexes bearing NHC ligands. Many of them exhibit good stability towards air and moisture. The studies on the coordinating properties of NHCs have translated into the development of a wide array of transition-metal-catalyzed transformations among which are the well-known olefin metathesis, palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reactions, and more recently C\u2013H bond activation.3 Therefore, the design of chiral NHC ligands has been the subject of intensive and fruitful research.4 So far, two main strategies for the design of chiral monodentate NHC ligands have been explored: (i) the incorporation of chiral patterns as N-substituents, structure A,5 including polycyclic structures, structure B 6 (Fig. 1.1); (ii) the use of a chiral backbone, structure C,7 that can be associated with dissymmetric aryl groups\nas N-substituents, structure D 8 (Fig. 1.2). These two designs can even be combined.5d,9\nRecently, we have developed another design based on a restricted rotation of a dissymmetric N-aryl substituent along the C\u2013N bond. The presence of both methyl groups on the NHC backbone and the metal enabled us to achieve high rotational barrier values and thus obtain configurationally stable complexes (Fig. 1.3).10 Advantageously, this approach\n\u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

Thus, complexes E are obtained as racemic mixtures. Nevertheless, thanks to the high stability of many NHC\u2013metal complexes, in particular enabling purification by silica gel chromatography, a resolution by chiral HPLC at the preparative scale afforded complexes with excellent enantiopurities and high yields. Of note is that this technique of resolution by chiral HPLC11 has been used to prepare various chiral NHC ligands6d,12 and more recently was applied to obtain enantiopure metal\u2013carbene complexes.13 Complexes bearing a C1-symmetric NHC ligand,14 for which only one axis of chirality is present, are very convenient to study the rotational barrier values. Thus, they allow fine tuning of the NHC structure in order to obtain atropisomeric metal\u2013NHC complexes displaying good configurational stability.10 Nonetheless, enantiopure C1-symmetric Pd\u2013 NHC complexes have catalyzed the intramolecular \u03b1-arylation of amides with a moderate enantioselectivity (up to 64% ee).10c\nHerein, we disclose the extension of the concept of atropisomeric metal\u2013NHC complexes to C2-symmetric NHC ligands, which might lead to the formation of meso complexes (meso-F) in addition to both enantiomers (F and ent-F).

            "text": "Several symmetric imidazolium salts 1\u00b7X containing methyl substituents at the 4 and 5 positions were synthesized according to literature procedures (Fig. 2).15,16 Since the imidazolium salt possessing bulky tert-butyl groups as ortho-substituents could not be synthesized, the dissymmetric imidazolium salt 1b\u00b7OTf with a tert-butyl group on one side and an iso-propyl group on the other side was prepared. 1H NMR spectroscopy analyses indicated that these imidazolium salts possess two resonances for the characteristic proton at position 2 accounting for two isomeric forms in solution. An in-depth study on imidazolium salts 1d\u2013f\u00b7X demonstrated that the nature of the anion X (Cl, OTf, and BF4) does not influence significantly the isomeric ratios (Table S1\u2020).15 However, the NMR solvents used for these analyses led to sharp differences in the isomeric\nratios in the case of imidazolium salt 1d\u00b7X spanning from 1 : 1.2 in CDCl3 to 1 : 9 in acetone-d6. For imidazolium salts 1e\u00b7X and 1f\u00b7X, the isomeric ratios remain similar whatever the NMR solvent is, 1 : 10 and 1 : 5 respectively. We hypothesized that 1d\u00b7X isomers are rotamers while a second ortho-substituent on the N-aryl groups, either a fluorine or a methyl group, leads to an increase in the rotational barrier values about the N\u2013C bonds and gives rise to atropisomers (two diastereomers).\nIn order to gain insight into the values of the rotational barriers, theoretical calculations were run (Scheme 1).15,17 According to these calculations, cis-conformations (meso) are more stable than trans-conformations (chiral). As expected, the more energetically favourable rotations take place with the benzhydryl groups on the side of the imidazolium proton (\u0394G=\u00f0H\u00de) since the methyl groups prevent rotation on the backbone side (\u0394G=\u00f0BB\u00de). The calculated values indicate that the rotation of N-aryl substituents is not restricted in the case of imidazolium 1d\u00b7X (\u0394G=\u00f0H\u00de = 69.7 kJ mol\n\u22121; t1/2 = 0.1 s at 25 \u00b0C). For imidazolium salts 1e\u00b7BF4 and 1f\u00b7BF4, containing additional ortho substituents on the N-aryl groups, either a fluorine or methyl, values of rotational barriers are substantially higher and the rotations of the N-aryl groups appear to be restricted, \u0394G=\u00f0H\u00de = 108.7 kJ mol\n\u22121; t1/2 = 7 days at 25 \u00b0C and \u0394G=\u00f0H\u00de = 155.9 kJ mol\n\u22121; t1/2 = 4 M years at 25 \u00b0C, respectively. In view of these results, we conclude that for imidazolium salts 1e\u00b7X and 1f\u00b7X, the two isomeric forms observed in solution are diastereomers and can be characterized using a diastereomeric ratio (dr). We attempted to isolate the major diastereomers of imidazolium salts 1e\u00b7BF4 and 1f\u00b7BF4. Diastereomerically pure imidazolium salts were obtained by recrystallization or/and silica gel chromatography.15 X-ray diffraction analyses of major diastereomers enabled us to unambiguously attribute the trans-conformation to these compounds (Fig. 3) and suggest that the formation of these imidazolium salts occurs under kinetic control.\nImidazolium salts 1\u00b7X were used to prepare the corresponding Pd(allyl)Cl(NHC) complexes 2 in order to probe the formation of chiral vs. meso complexes, respectively (\u00b1)-2 and meso-2 (Table 1). Imidazolium 1a\u00b7BF4 containing isopropyl\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Dalton Trans., 2023, 52, 8728\u20138736 | 8729\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The structure of meso-2a was unambiguously determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies (Fig. 4) and no trace of the expected chiral complex 2a was detected. The complex formation was repeated at 60 \u00b0C and using K2CO3 instead of tBuOK (conditions B) according to the procedure disclosed by Nolan and Cazin (entry 2).18 Complex meso-2a was isolated in a higher yield (78%) but still without formation of (\u00b1)-2a. At this stage, we postulated that more hindered ortho-substituents on the aromatic side groups should favor the formation of a chiral complex. Nevertheless, with pre-ligand 1b\u00b7OTf, the corresponding complex 2b was obtained with a cis arrangement of the tert-butyl and isopropyl groups, even if the presence of a small amount of trans-2b cannot be ruled out.15 Of note, complex cis-2b is chiral but can be considered a \u201cpseudo meso\u201d complex. At this stage, we hypothesized that the preferential formation of meso complexes might be the result of an induced dipole-induced dipole attraction involving alkyl groups in the ortho position (London dispersion forces).19 Thus, we turned our attention toward imidazolium salt 1c\u00b7BF4 containing phenyl groups as ortho-substituents (entries 4 and 5). Conditions A allowed the formation of 2 complexes that could be separated by silica gel chromatography. The 1H NMR spectrum of one of these complexes exhibited two sets of signals for the allyl pattern due to conformers resulting from the allyl orientation and we attributed them to (\u00b1)-2c. Whereas for meso-2c, the plane of symmetry results in only one set of signals for the allylic protons.15 This statement was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of both complexes (Fig. 4). Under conditions A, the yields of (\u00b1)-2c and meso-2c were moderate and the meso complex was formed in higher proportions (entry 4). Conditions B improved the overall yield and the expected complex (\u00b1)-2c was found to be the major palladium complex (entry 5). Under conditions B, the benzhydryl containing salt 1d\u00b7BF4 led to the formation of two diastereomers which were separated by silica gel chromatography to give rise to (\u00b1)-2d and meso-2d, in respectively 28% and 62% yields (entry 6). The structure of meso-2d was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. 4). Because imidazolium\nsalt 1e\u00b7BF4 has been synthesized mainly as the trans diastereomer (dr = 10 : 1), complex meso-2e was not observed and only racemic complex (\u00b1)-2e was isolated in good yield (72%, entry 7). When imidazolium salt 1f\u00b7BF4 has been used as a mixture of diastereomers (dr = 5 : 1), the corresponding Pd(allyl)Cl(NHC) complexes (\u00b1)-2f and meso-2f were formed in overall good yield (79%) and in a 5 : 1 ratio (entry 8). Unfortunately, both diastereomers could not be efficiently separated by silica gel chromatography. However, when diastereomerically pure 1f\u00b7BF4 was employed, only complex (\u00b1)-2f was formed with excellent yield. Remarkably, this experiment was performed on a gram scale.15\nNext, we extended the complex synthesis to Pd(cinnamyl)Cl (NHC) 3 using imidazolium tetrafluoroborate 1d\u2013f\u00b7BF4 (Table 2). The treatment of the dimeric [Pd(cinnamyl)Cl]2 and 1d\u00b7BF4 with K2CO3 in acetone at 60 \u00b0C gave rise to the sole formation of complex meso-3d (entry 1). The presence of the expected chiral complex could not be detected. This indicates that the nature of the allylic ligand has an influence on the diastereoselectivity of the metalation step; unfortunately, the sterically demanding cinnamyl favours the formation of the achiral complex. Configurationally stable imidazolium salts 1e\u00b7BF4 and 1f\u00b7BF4 enabled us to circumvent this issue. Solely complex (\u00b1)-3e was obtained starting from 1e\u00b7BF4 (dr = 10 : 1) with a moderate yield (68%, entry 2). As using 1f\u00b7BF4 with a 5 : 1 diastereomeric ratio resulted in an inseparable mixture of complexes (\u00b1)-3f and meso-3f with a ratio 5 : 1 (entry 3), diastereomerically pure 1f\u00b7BF4 allowed the single formation of the chiral complex (\u00b1)-3f with excellent yield (entry 4). Following the same protocol, chiral complex (\u00b1)-4f containing a tertbutyl-indenyl group as an ancillary ligand was prepared in moderate yield starting from diastereomerically pure imidazolium salt 1f\u00b7BF4 (Scheme 2).\nHaving a series of 8 chiral palladium\u2013NHC complexes, we studied the racemate resolution by chiral HPLC at a preparative scale (Scheme 3). Various chiral columns were screened and the detection of enantiomers was performed with an UV\u2013 vis detector connected to a circular dichroism detector, giving the CD sign at 254 nm for each enantiomer. The chiralpak IG column enabled the efficient resolution of all palladium complexes.15 Using a 1 cm diameter column, batches from 15 to 850 mg were purified in several hours affording both enantiomers with excellent enantiopurities, superior to 99.5% ee for most of the complexes. Yields of the resolution step span from 23 to 97% as a function of the complex.\nThe configurational stability of these chiral complexes was found to be good, as attempts to determine experimentally the diastereomerization barriers require prolonged heating at 130 \u00b0C or at a higher temperature which causes a complex degradation faster than the diastereomerization process.\nThe low stability of complex (\u00b1)-2c in solution and in the solid state explains the low yields of enantiopure complexes (29 and 21%). To illustrate the efficiency of the resolution by chiral HPLC at a preparative scale, a batch of 850 mg of (\u00b1)-2f afforded 420 mg (49%) and 401 mg (48%) of both enantiomers after 45 injections every 5 min (about 4 h for the complete resolution).

Of note, the modification of the absolute configuration between complexes 2e and 2f is the result of priority changes to assess the stereodescriptors.\nUV-vis and ECD spectra for both enantiomers for all complexes have been recorded in acetonitrile solutions. Individual ECD spectra, reported in the ESI,\u2020 showed expected mirror images for both enantiomers.15 The comparison of ECD spectra with those of complexes that have been studied by\nX-ray crystallography was used to assign absolute configurations of all complexes. As an example, ECD spectra of the 2nd eluted complexes 2f, 3f and 4f, depicted in Fig. 5, show a similar shape for complexes 2f and 3f with a positive ECDactive band between 195 and 200 nm and a negative ECDactive band between 220 and 230 nm. Thus, allyl- and cinnamyl-complexes 2f and 3f possess the same spatial conformation. tert-Butyl-indenyl complex 4f displays an ECD spectrum being the mirror image of those of complexes 2f and 3f indicating an inversion of the elution order, although the optical rotation values of all 2nd eluted complexes are positive (+).

In comparison, (\u2212)-(Ra,Ra)-2e allowed to improve the isolated yield with a slight decrease of the enantioinduction (72%, entry 2).\nEnantiopure complexes 2f enabled us to obtain both good activity and an excellent enantioselectivity (95% ee, entries 3 and 4). From the efficiency point of view, catalysts containing bulkier NHC ligands display a high activity since they favor reductive elimination. Of note, we noticed that pre-catalyst meso-2f was significantly less efficient than chiral analogs (entry 5). It seems that having the sterically hindered benzhydryl groups on only one side of the NHC is less favorable to boosting the reductive elimination. This observation is in sharp contrast with the study disclosed by K\u00fcndig.20i Based on DFT calculations, it has been proposed that oxidative addition is the rate-determining step. Nevertheless, a recent theoretical study on palladium-catalyzed \u03b1-arylation of ketones with phosphine ligands suggested that reductive elimination is the ratelimiting step.21 As expected, the nature of the allyl derivative ligand has no meaningful influence on the enantioselectivity (72% ee, entry 2 vs. 77% ee, entry 6) (95% ee, entries 3 and 4 Scheme 3 Resolution of racemic complexes by cHPLC at a preparative scale.\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Dalton Trans., 2023, 52, 8728\u20138736 | 8733\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

As isolated yields are good to excellent, the effect of the nature of the allyl derivative ligand on catalytic activity cannot be confidently addressed. At 25 \u00b0C, using (+)-(Ra,Ra)-2f, only a tiny amount of 6a was isolated with a similar enantiomeric excess (92%, entry 9). At higher temperatures, 60 or 80 \u00b0C, identical ees were measured (entries 10 and 11). This observation proves that not only pre-catalysts but also catalytic species possess excellent configuration stability.\nThe scope of the intramolecular \u03b1-arylation of amides was studied with several substrates using enantiopure complexes 2f, either (+)-(Ra,Ra)-2f or (\u2212)-(Sa,Sa)-2f (Scheme 4). Absolute configurations of products were determined based on the work of K\u00fcndig20b,i or by analogy and were tentative. With amide 5a (Cl), the chlorinated analogue of 5a, a similar yield of 6a(Cl) was isolated possessing the same enantiopurity. The reaction was complete after 20 h at 40 \u00b0C with 5b containing a methoxy group at the para position of the bromine. Substrates bearing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the meta position, OMe (5c) and OCF3 (5d) respectively, were found less reactive and required either a prolonged reaction time (60 h) or an increase of the reaction temperature to 60 \u00b0C to reach completion. All these products were isolated with enantiomeric excesses superior to 90% ee. With substrates derived from ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, products 6e, 6f and 6g, respectively, were isolated with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. A slightly higher enantiomeric excess was obtained with N-benzyl-substituted substrate 5h (6h, 98% ee) compared to N-methyl-substituted substrate 5a. The nature of the alkyl group of the stereogenic center has an influence on\nthe enantioselectivity related to its steric bulk: methyl (6a, 95% ee), ethyl (6i, 87% ee) and cyclopentyl (6j, 45% ee). Of note, substrate 5j has been previously investigated by Trapp and coworkers and up to 55% ee for 6j was reported.20h We screened again several enantiopure atropisomeric Pd\u2013NHC complexes and using the fluorine containing complex (\u2212)-(Ra,Ra)-2e the enantiomeric excess was increased up to 72% ee. Substrate 5k containing a methyl and an allyl group on the stereogenic center represents a very challenging substrate. Despite the full conversion of the substrate at 60 \u00b0C and the good isolated yield of product 6k, only a low enantiomeric excess (24% ee) was reached. To our delight, the highly enantio-enriched spiro compound 6l (92% ee) was isolated in high yield (92%) under the same conditions with catalyst (+)-(Ra,Ra)-2f."

            "text": "In conclusion, we successfully applied the concept of atropisomeric NHC\u2013metal complexes to C2-symmetric NHC ligands and implemented it into the preparation of chiral palladium complexes. The use of imidazolium salts with unrestricted rotation axes (rotamers) as NHC precursors gave mostly meso palladium complexes, probably as thermodynamic products. To circumvent this issue, imidazolium salts containing additional ortho-substituents (F or Me) were found to be conformationally stable and have been prepared mainly as chiral, yet racemic. So far, we could not unambiguously point out the parameters governing the formation of either meso or chiral complexes; the working hypothesis involving London dispersion forces could not be clearly demonstrated. Thus, several chiral palladium(II) complexes containing an allyl, a cinnamyl or a tBu-indenyl group as an ancillary ligand were synthesized. These racemic complexes exhibited good chemical stability and could be resolved using chiral HPLC at the preparative scale. Both enantiomers of each palladium complex were obtained with excellent enantiopurities and overall good yields and this strategy could be efficiently implemented up to 850 mg scale. The absolute configuration of the enantiopure complexes was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction and comparison of the ECD spectra. Enantiopure complexes were tested in the intramolecular \u03b1-arylation of amides and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee) can be achieved with some of the enantiopure atropisomeric palladium complexes that have been designed and prepared. This finding is in sharp contrast to results obtained with analogue C1-symmetric NHC\u2013palladium complexes (up to 54% ee).10b Having in hand a new and efficient design of chiral catalysts, further development of new enantioselective reactions is currently underway in our laboratory."
