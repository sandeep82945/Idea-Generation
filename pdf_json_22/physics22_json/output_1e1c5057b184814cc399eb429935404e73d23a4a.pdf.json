    "abstractText": "We study effective field theories (EFTs) enjoying (maximal) biform symmetries. These are defined by the presence of a conserved (electric) current that has the symmetries of a Young tableau with two columns of equal length. When these theories also have a topological (magnetic) biform current, its conservation law is anomalous. We go on to show that this mixed anomaly uniquely fixes the two-point function between the electric and magnetic currents. We then perform a K\u00e4ll\u00e9n-Lehmann spectral decomposition of the current-current correlator, proving that there is a massless mode in the spectrum, whose masslessness is protected by the anomaly. Furthermore, the anomaly gives rise to a universal form of the EFT whose most relevant term \u2014 which resembles the linear Einstein action \u2014 dominates the infrared physics. As applications of this general formalism, we study the theories of a Galileon superfluid and linearized gravity. Thus, one can view the masslessness of the graviton as being protected by the anomalous biform symmetries. The associated EFT provides an organizing principle for gravity at low energies in terms of physical symmetries, and allows interactions consistent with linearized diffeomorphism invariance. These theories are not ultraviolet-complete \u2014 the relevant symmetries can be viewed as emergent \u2014 nor do they include the nonlinearities necessary to make them fully diffeomorphism invariant, so there is no contradiction with the expectation that quantum gravity cannot have any global symmetries.",

            "text": "Symmetry is a powerful concept in physics, providing an organizing principle that dictates how we construct mathematical theories describing nature. Symmetries control the properties of phase transitions and they explain why certain phases are robust, with Goldstone\u2019s theorem serving as perhaps the oldest example of this line of reasoning [1\u20133]. In the last decade, our conceptions of what symmetries are, or can be, have been extensively broadened. Vast generalizations of symmetry have been proposed, starting with higher-form symmetries [4]\u2014which act on extended objects \u2014 and including more exotic structures, like 2-groups and non-invertible symmetries. Anomalies for these new structures have been understood and incorporated into the general program of studying the possible phases of quantum field theory. These new viewpoints have both brought new results to light and have placed old results into sharper focus. For example, one can understand Goldstone\u2019s theorem as a consequence of anomalies, which protect the gaplessness of certain phases [5]. Symmetries play an essential role in the phenomenological study of both condensed matter and particle physics. Experimentally, we only ever have access to the physics of a system below some energy scale (the resolution of our apparatus, or the amount of energy we can generate). In this case, a complete microscopic description of the system is not necessarily the most useful parameterization of the physics. Instead, it is often effective field theory (EFT) that provides the most practical organizing principle. In this way we can understand a wide range of problems \u2014 all the way from the Standard Model to the Ising model \u2014 in the same language. This perspective has been extremely successful in understanding much of the physics of the possible phases of matter at low energies, and the transitions between them.\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nAs an important example of the utility of this paradigm, one can understand the emergence of gauge theories as a consequence of global symmetries and their effective descriptions. For example, the magnetic 1-form symmetry associated to the conservation of magnetic flux leads, at low energies, to EFTs described by the usual Maxwell theory coupled to electric matter. When this matter is gapped, the deep infrared is described by free photons that emerge as the Goldstones for the original magnetic 1-form symmetry [4, 6, 7], which is spontaneously broken. The explanatory power of this perspective suggests that one should take this physical symmetry (as opposed to the unphysical redundancy that is gauge invariance) as the organizing principle underlying these theories as a guide to finding a more microscopic description from which electromagnetism is emergent.1 What about gravity? How does gravity fit into this paradigm?2 Unfortunately, there is good evidence (see for example [11]) that gravity cannot have any exact global symmetries that survive all the way to the ultraviolet (UV). If one had a unique UV-complete description of the universe which was under control, we could take this to be the end of the story and just view gravity to be a low energy accident of this complete description. However, we do not have full non-perturbative control of string theory, or even know if it is the unique UV-complete theory that can describe nature. And further, there is plausibly a full landscape of solutions in string theory which can lead to very different low energy physics. Some progress has been made in addressing these challenges in the form of the Swampland program (see e.g., [12] for a review). Nevertheless, it is fair to say that it is still unclear whether this approach can fully explain the characteristics of our low energy phase of nature, which we usually associate with Einstein gravity (and its irrelevant corrections). Therefore, it seems useful to search for an organizing principle with which to construct gravity as an EFT. In other words: what is the gauge-invariant language that characterizes gravity? In this work we make a modest attempt to answer this question in the language of EFT. We show that linearized gravity has a global continuous symmetry that fits into a category of symmetries that can be called maximal higher-biform symmetries. We show that this provides a guiding principle that is sufficient to construct the linearized Einstein theory and its irrelevant corrections. Furthermore, we show how an anomaly between the magnetic and an electric version of this biform symmetry is responsible for protecting the masslessness of the graviton and keeping the low-energy phase gapless. This line of reasoning extends previous results for usual 0-form symmetries [5] and higher form symmetries [6] to the present context. This result amounts to a generalized Goldstone theorem for this type of system. We begin by presenting a general framework to study theories with biform symmetries, focusing mostly on the description of the gapless phase of these systems. There are two alternative, but equivalent, perspectives on how to think about these phases. From the more abstract perspective, it is only the symmetries and their anomalies that determine the low energy physics, and everything else follows from this symmetry structure. Given this input, one can constrain the general form of correlation functions of conserved currents.\n1Early approaches to this problem involved the formulation of theories in loop space [8] which has been courageously revisited recently in [9].\n2See [10] for an interesting attempt at understanding this problem from a related point of view.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nFrom these universal correlation functions, one can deduce the spectrum of the system, and see that it must necessarily have a gapless degree of freedom. We use this perspective to obtain the low energy physics of the simplest systems exhibiting biform symmetries: a Galileon superfluid and linearized gravity. A complementary viewpoint is to realize these universal results via a concrete instantiation by building an EFT Lagrangian that describes the relevant physics and reproduces the anomaly structure. Interestingly, the anomaly that is responsible for the gaplessness of the phase ends up being coded in a general kind of interaction similar to the linearized Einstein action. This low energy action shares many features with Chern-Simons [13, 14] and BF theories \u2014 its equations of motion are a partial flatness condition on the gauge-invariant curvature \u2014 but, crucially, gives rise to propagating massless degrees of freedom. We study this phenomenon in detail and construct the associated EFTs realizing higher-biform symmetries.\nAfter having constructed the EFTs of interest, one can notice that they always involve some form of generalized gauge theory. Indeed, massless degrees of freedom with spin s \u2265 1 always display emergent gauge symmetries, which are crucial for removing redundant degrees of freedom while keeping a manifestly Lorentz invariant description. Historically, these gauge symmetries have been used to \u201cexplain\u201d the gaplessness of the low energy phase, for example the photon is typically said to be massless because of gauge symmetry. However, from this perspective they are merely an inevitable consequence of our desire to write a manifestly Lorentz-invariant EFT that realizes the physical biform symmetries. Still, one can ask: what are these massless modes gauging? This is equivalent to asking what the charged degrees of freedom are that we gap and integrate out to obtain a theory purely of massless gauge fields. In the case of electromagnetism, these massive degrees of freedom just correspond to charged particles such as electrons. Interestingly, it turns out that for linearized gravity, the gapped degrees of freedom that carry charge under the emergent gauge symmetry of the graviton can be viewed as fractonic particles. This provides a precise construction of the ideas advocated in [15\u201317].3\nIt is important to emphasize that the symmetries described here do not only apply to free linearized gravity. As in any EFT, it is possible to classify and add an infinite number of irrelevant deformations which \u2014 while trivial in the infrared \u2014 introduce interactions at higher energies. However, these interactions are still linear gauge invariant, of the type described in [28\u201332], and so do not include the types of nonlinear interactions that allow the theory to become nonlinearly diffeomorphism invariant. Much like Einstein gravity, these theories are also not UV complete. Therefore, there is still the important question of why or how these biform symmetries arise at low energies from a microscopic UV-complete theory of gravity. For example, are there associated biform Ward identities in string theory, and what are their consequences? It is also interesting to understand what if anything the Swampland program has to say about the possible UV completions of these EFTs. While we return to discuss these questions in section 5, we hope that this is a first step toward understanding the emergence of gravity in our universe.\n3There has been a substantial amount of recent work related to the physics of fractons and their relation to these general ideas. More details can be found for example in [18\u201327] and references therein.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 the general theory of biform symmetries is presented, gapless field theories displaying these biform symmetries are constructed, and the connection to the physics of fractons is discussed. In section 3 we review the EFT of relativistic superfluids, its symmetries and anomalies, and generalize these results to the Galileon superfluid. This system constitutes the simplest theory enjoying a (scalar) biform symmetry. In section 4 we study linearized gravity and its irrelevant corrections in detail and frame this physics in the language of biform symmetries. We show how the symmetry and anomaly structure are sufficient to completely fix the two-point function of conserved currents and, as a consequence, protect the masslessness of the graviton. In section 5 we synthesize these results and discuss future directions. Several technical details somewhat outside the main line of development are presented in appendices: in appendix A we describe the systematics of the spectral decompositions required to prove that various phases have gapless excitations. In appendix B we provide some additional details about the anomaly structure of the Galileon superfluid. In appendix C we present Maxwell electromagnetism in the same language as the rest of the paper, realizing the photon as a Goldstone. Finally, in appendix D we present more technical details about the anomaly structure and spectral decomposition in the case of linearized gravity.\nDisclaimer. While this work was in preparation [17, 33] appeared, which have some overlap with this work.\nNotation and conventions. We work in flat d-dimensional Euclidean space with metric \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd which we use to raise, lower, and contract indices. We (anti-)symmetrize indices with unit weight, e.g., \u2202(\u00b5A\u03bd) = 12(\u2202\u00b5A\u03bd + \u2202\u03bdA\u00b5). We use the manifestly antisymmetric convention for mixed-symmetry tensors and Young tableaux. We label two-column Young diagrams as (i|j) where i, j are the lengths of the columns from left to right."

The resulting framework will allow for the construction of EFT Lagrangians for these theories, which describe their different phases.

            "text": "When constructing universal EFTs, the guiding principle should always be the physical symmetries of the system. Once we know the algebra of conserved charges and the way that charged operators represent these symmetries we can then build the EFT. This is what makes electromagnetism, for example, universal: it is the local EFT of a theory with a 1-form symmetry in its symmetry broken (i.e., gapless) phase. Notice that this approach is completely agnostic about what the UV microphysics that gave rise to this EFT is, or even whether the EFT can be UV completed. The theory might be formulated microscopically in terms of the dynamics of extended objects (as is often the case for higher-form symmetries), or a quantum field theory, or even a lattice model. This is, at this stage, of little consequence. All we demand is that the theory is a local field theory at low energies. In local theories, conserved quantities corresponding to continuous symmetries are generally given by integrals of local current operators. In all of the following we will concentrate on abelian continuous symmetries, and will assume the existence of associated conserved currents. We want to trace the logic that leads from these conserved quantities to local degrees of freedom in a field-theoretic description. The physics that we review in this section is elementary, but we want to introduce it in a language that will be appropriate for generalization to cases enjoying higher biform symmetries, like linearized gravity. One way to proceed is to start with the desired current \u2014 for example for a 0-form symmetry the current is J\u00b5. Next, we express this operator in terms of elementary fields as J\u00b5[\u03c6]. Lastly, we construct an EFT Lagrangian such that equations of motion for the fields \u03c6 lead to the conservation law for the current: \u2202\u00b5J\u00b5 = 0. This construction makes manifest the symmetry for which J\u00b5 is a Noether current, in the sense that this symmetry acts locally on the fields \u03c6. The associated conserved charge can be written as:\nQ = \u222b\n\u03a3d\u22121 \u2217J , (2.1)\nwhere the integral is over a codimension 1 surface \u03a3d\u22121. As is well-known, the conservation of J implies that Q depends only topologically on the surface \u03a3. These symmetries are often called dynamical, or electric. An alternative option is to realize our desired current as a magnetic symmetry. In this case, we would start with a (d\u22121)-form electric current, J\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22121 , where d is the dimension of spacetime. If we want a magnetic 0-form symmetry to emerge from this operator, it must be associated to the dual current 1-form current K(1) \u2261 \u2217J(d\u22121) which must be conserved:\n\u2202\u00b5K \u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5 ( \u00b5\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd\u22121J\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd\u22121 ) = 0 . (2.2)\nThe conservation condition (2.2) implies that J(d\u22121) is a closed (d\u2212 1)-form: dJ(d\u22121) = 0. Assuming that there are no topological obstructions, we can always parameterize this as an exact form:\nJ(d\u22121) = dA(d\u22122) , (2.3)\nwhere A(d\u22122) is a (d \u2212 2)-form. This parameterization necessarily introduces a gauge symmetry A(d\u22122) 7\u2192 A(d\u22122) + d\u03be(d\u22123), where \u03be(d\u22123) is a (d\u2212 3)-form. This gauge symmetry\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nis of course unphysical, and only a consequence of our choices. We can now construct any EFT Lagrangian in terms of A(d\u22122), provided it is gauge invariant. The conservation law we were interested in is then guaranteed by (2.3), independent of the equations of motion. Sometimes we call these symmetries topological or magnetic, but there is no real physics in this distinction. Topological symmetries can become dynamical symmetries in a different parameterization of the EFT in terms of different local fields. The breaking of a magnetic symmetry can only happen through the inclusion of topological defects which invalidate the equation (2.3). On the other hand, the electric symmetry is not guaranteed and it depends on the choice of EFT Lagrangian. If there is light electric matter, this symmetry will be explicitly broken.4 This is certainly allowed, as we were only building an EFT for the symmetry associated to K(1). However, if electric matter is gapped, we expect the electric current to be conserved and the original magnetic symmetry to be spontaneously broken. That is, conservation of the electric current, which is equivalent to dual conservation of K(1)\ndK(1) = 0 , (2.4)\nwill imply a wave equation for A(d\u22122) of the form\nA(d\u22122) = 0 , (2.5)\nwhere is the gauge-invariant Laplacian operator (e.g., A\u03bd = \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u00b5A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd\u2202\u00b5A\u00b5 if A\u03bd is a 1-form). This is the gapless phase of the theory. Coming back to our starting point, we see that we could have easily started from the electric realization of the symmetry and reached an equivalent destination. In order to make the physics of this gapless phase more explicit, note that if we want to build an EFT with this symmetry, without any additional matter (i.e., all other matter is gapped), we see that the most relevant term we can write whose Lagrangian is gauge invariant is\nSEFT[A] = \u222b ddxJ\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22121J\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22121 . (2.6)\nThis theory is nothing other than a free abelian (d \u2212 2)-form gauge theory. From some perspective, this reasoning is the actual origin of gauge symmetries in physics. As desired, the action (2.6) yields the equation of motion dK(1) = 0, corresponding to conservation of the electric symmetry. Had we chosen to represent K(1) = d\u03c6, for a scalar \u03c6, we would have obtained the same result, making it clear that the above theory is just a free scalar with a shift symmetry \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6+ c for any constant c. Notice that this choice of field variables would trivialize dK(1) = 0 (corresponding to conservation of the electric current), while conservation of the (1-form) magnetic current would be a consequence of the equations of motion, further illustrating that what we call a topological and what we call a dynamical symmetry depends on our choice of field variables.\n4Notice that in this case where we use A(d\u22122) as the field in the Lagrangian, electric matter is given by extended objects with space-time dimension d\u2212 2. While this complicates the construction of a Lagrangian, it does not appreciably affect the physics discussed.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nThe magnetic charge associated with the original 0-form symmetry that we were interested in can be written as:\nQm(\u03a3d\u22121) = \u222b\n\u03a3d\u22121 \u2217K(1) , (2.7)\nwhile the emergent electric charge associated with a (d\u2212 2)-form symmetry in the gapless phase is given by:\nQe(\u03a31) = \u222b\n\u03a31 \u2217J(d\u22121) . (2.8)\nWe see from this discussion in the magnetic language how a symmetry broken phase gives rise to a gapless scalar Goldstone mode. All of this can be straightforwardly generalized to any higher form symmetry associated to a conserved magnetic (d\u2212 p\u2212 1)-form current K(d\u2212p\u22121). (The previous example corresponds to p = d\u22122.) In this case, the starting point is an electric (p+1)-form current J(p+1) that must satisfy dJ(p+1) = 0 \u2014 which is equivalent to conservation of the magnetic current. We choose to parametrize this electric current in terms of a p-form gauge field A(p) as\nJ(p+1) = dA(p) , (2.9)\nwhich trivializes the constraint that J(p+1) be closed. Following the same path as before we find the effective theory in the phase where electric matter is gapped\nSEFT[A] = \u222b ddxJ\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1J\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1 , (2.10)\nwhich gives rise to the magnetic (d\u2212 p\u2212 2)-form charge\nQm(\u03a3p+1) = \u222b\n\u03a3p+1 \u2217K(d\u2212p\u22121) , (2.11)\nalong with an emergent electric p-form charge\nQe(\u03a3d\u2212p\u22121) = \u222b\n\u03a3d\u2212p\u22121 \u2217J(p) . (2.12)\nOperators charged under these physical symmetries are electric p-dimensional and magnetic (d \u2212 p \u2212 2)-dimensional extended objects which couple directly to A(p) and \u03c6(d\u2212p\u22122), respectively, where \u03c6 is a (d\u2212 p\u2212 2)-form defined as K(d\u2212p\u22121) = d\u03c6(d\u2212p\u22122). More irrelevant terms in the effective theory can be constructed from J(p+1) and its derivatives and added to the action. For example, one could imagine adding to the action terms like J4, J6, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . These terms would keep the magnetic symmetry unmodified, since dJ(p+1) = 0 still, but would change the electric symmetry current operator. This is an important point \u2014 in general in the gapless phases of interest the currents J(p+1) and K(d\u2212p\u22121) are just Hodge duals of each other in the deep IR (i.e., at the free level). However, these two currents are not equivalent once we begin to introduce interactions. Still, the electric symmetry would not be disturbed provided we do not add light electrically charged matter to our Lagrangian. One way see this is to invoke Noether\u2019s theorem. The actions\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nabove, including their irrelevant deformations, have a p-form symmetry \u03b4A(p) = \u039b(p), where \u039b(p) is a constant p-form satisfying d\u039b(p) = 0. Noether\u2019s theorem then guarantees that, if we consider a general perturbation A(p) 7\u2192 A(p) + \u03b4A(p), we must have:\n\u03b4S \u223c \u222b\nddx \u03b4A\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p\u2202\u00b5J\u0302\u00b5\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p , (2.13)\nwhere J\u0302(p+1) must be conserved on-shell, and is therefore the desired electric current. This reasoning is valid for all our effective actions and thus J\u0302(p+1) can be computed in each case in terms of J(p+1). Its precise form will depend on the details of the theory, but the existence of some conserved current is robust. We claimed, rather carelessly, that in the absence of matter the EFT associated to the higher form symmetries above describes gapless phases of matter. This is not strictly true. When integrating out matter, the effect of their anomalies cannot be neglected. For example, for d = 2p+ 1, there exist Chern-Simons terms that can appear in the low energy effective action if the integrated-out matter breaks parity invariance. These Chern-Simons terms are more relevant than the Maxwell-type terms described above. They would give a theory in the deep IR of the form\nSCS[A] = \u222b d2p+1x \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b52p+1A\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5pJ\u00b5p+1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b52p+1 . (2.14)\nThe equations of motion are fundamentally different in this case \u2014 being a flatness condition, J(p+1) = 0, rather than a wave equation \u2014 and the phase of matter becomes gapped. If the original continuous symmetry is compact, the gapped phase just has a discrete symmetry. If it is non-compact, the lack of local degrees of freedom ensures one can still build topological charge operators (i.e., they are not built from a gauge-invariant local current) of the form:\nQtop(\u03a3p) = \u222b\n\u03a3p A(p) . (2.15)\nIn both cases, we could say the original symmetry we were aiming to describe by J(p+1) (and its dual K(d\u2212p\u22121)) got gauged and new symmetries appear. A more general version of this phenomenon is given by BF-type Lagrangians. In that case, if we have two gauge fields, say A(p) and B(d\u2212p\u22121) we can write the Lagrangian\nSBF = \u222b ddx \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5dA\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p (dB)\u00b5p+1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d . (2.16)\nLike the Chern-Simons example, this theory is gapped and our would-be currents dA and dB vanish as a consequence of the equations of motion. The systematics of the above structures are built on the theory of differential forms and their exterior calculus. The Poincar\u00e9 lemma plays an important role by guaranteeing that, in the absence of topological defects, closed forms can be written in terms of exact ones, i.e., that dJ(p+1) = 0 implies J(p+1) = dA(p). This is of course always locally true. In terms of representation theory, all the currents and gauge fields transform in antisymmetric tensor representations of GL(d,R) labeled by single-column Young diagrams. In the next subsection we will generalize this by considering Young tableaux made up of two vertical columns. This may seem to be an extravagance, but is actually necessary to cast (linearized) gravity in the same framework.\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1"

            "heading": "2.2 Higher-biform symmetries",
            "text": "We now want to generalize the type of conserved currents we consider when building EFTs. We will be interested in currents transforming in irreducible representations of GL(d,R) labeled by two-column Young diagrams (see [34\u201344] for other work involving these representations). We will call these mixed-symmetry representations biforms, since they are, in a sense, the natural generalization of differential forms to having two sets of antisymmetric indices. Under the action of a properly defined exterior derivative, these form a complex. The mathematics associated to its differential calculus, Poincar\u00e9 lemma, and cohomology has been developed [45\u201350], see [51, 52] for reviews and a complete list of references and [53] for the results of interest to our discussion. Here, in order to make the discussion self contained, we present the very little technology that we need, with some small modifications with respect to [53], in order to move forward. Equivalent biform field theories were also constructed in [54, 55] Let us start with the simplest (and most important) example. Consider a theory with an electric current J(p+1|p+1) that transforms in an irreducible representation of GL(d,R) labeled by a Young diagram with two identical vertical columns of length p+ 1:\nJ(p+1|p+1) \u2208  p+ 1 . (2.17) We call such an object a (p + 1|p + 1)-biform.5 We wish to build a conserved magnetic current, K, from J(p+1|p+1). The Hodge star operator can now act on either of the two columns of our current. In this case, since J(p+1|p+1) has two identical columns, it is of no consequence which column we dualize. It is actually most convenient to dualize both columns and define\nK(d\u2212p\u22121|d\u2212p\u22121) = \u2217J(p+1|p+1)\u2217 : K\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u2212p\u22121|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd\u2212p\u22121 = \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5dJ\u00b5d\u2212p\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d|\u03bdd\u2212p\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd \u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd .\n(2.18) Here both J and K are antisymmetric under the interchange of any of the indices inside a block separated by |. Since the two sets of indices are of equal length, they are additionally symmetric under the interchange of these two blocks of indices.\nWe would like K(d\u2212p\u22121|d\u2212p\u22121) to satisfy the conservation equation\n\u2202\u00b51K \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u2212p\u22121|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd\u2212p\u22121 = 0 , (2.19)\nwhich is equivalent to imposing the condition\n(dJ)(p+2|p+1) = 0 . (2.20)\n5We adopt the convention for mixed-symmetry tensors that they are manifestly antisymmetric in the indices associated to a column. The only other constraint is that antisymmetrizing all the indices from the first column plus any index from the second column causes the tensor to vanish. When necessary, we refer to two-column Young diagrams using the notation (p | q), where p and q label the column lengths from left to right.\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nThe exterior derivative above is defined with the correct (anti-)symmetrization properties so that (dJ)(p+2|p+1) is a (p+ 2|p+ 1)-biform. More generally, let us define the set of maximal biforms, denoted by \u2126\u0302. These are given by the direct sum of the space of (p|p)-biforms, \u2126(p|p), and (q + 1|q)-biforms, \u2126(q+1|q) for all p, q.\n\u2126\u0302 = ( \u2295p \u2126(p|p) ) \u2295 ( \u2295q \u2126(q+1|q) ) . (2.21)\nWe call the first set above ( \u2295p \u2126(p|p) ) even biforms and the second set ( \u2295q \u2126(q+1|q) ) odd biforms. In this section we will be interested in an even current J(p+1|p+1). More explicitly, the symmetry types of elements of these vector spaces are\n\u2126(p|p) \u2208 p p , \u2126(q+1|q) \u2208 q q . (2.22)\nOn this set we define the action of the exterior derivative by (anti-)symmetrization such that it takes elements of \u2126(p|p) to \u2126(p+1|p) and elements of \u2126(p+1|p) to \u2126(p+1|p+1):\nd : \u2126(p|p) \u2192 \u2126(p+1|p) , d : \u2126(p+1|p) \u2192 \u2126(p+1|p+1) . (2.23)\nNote that the operator d is nilpotent of degree 3, i.e., d3 = 0. This follows because acting with d three times guarantees that we will be antisymmetrizing over at least two partial derivatives. It is clear, from the present discussion, why we chose to define K by the double action of the Hodge operator \u2217. This choice implies that the dual of a maximal biform is itself a maximal biform.\n\u2217 \u00b7 \u2217 : \u2126(p|p) \u2192 \u2126(d\u2212p|d\u2212p) , \u2217 \u00b7 \u2217 : \u2126(p+1|p) \u2192 \u2126(d\u2212p|d\u2212p\u22121) . (2.24)\nReturning to our current, we would like to introduce a gauge field that makes dJ(p+1|p+1) = 0 automatic in the absence of defects. From the fact that d3 = 0, it is clear that we can take6\nJ(p+1|p+1) = d2h(p|p) , (2.25)\nwhere we have introduced a (p|p)-biform h(p|p) as a new gauge field. With this definition h(p|p) enjoys a gauge symmetry h(p|p) 7\u2192 h(p|p) +d\u03be(p|p\u22121), where \u03be(p|p\u22121) is a (p|p\u22121)-biform. Any effective theory constructed in a gauge-invariant manner from h(p|p) will necessarily have a new type of symmetry arising from the conservation of the magnetic current K(d\u2212p\u22121|d\u2212p\u22121). We will call this symmetry a maximal (d\u2212 p\u2212 2)-biform symmetry. We can construct magnetic charges in this theory by contracting K(d\u2212p\u22121|d\u2212p\u22121) with a (d\u2212 p\u2212 1)-form, %(d\u2212p\u22121) using the flat metric to define:\nK (%) \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u2212p\u22121 = K\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u2212p\u22121|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd\u2212p\u22121% \u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd\u2212p\u22121 . (2.26)\nWith this definition, the conserved charges are given by Q(%)m (\u03a3p+1) = \u222b\n\u03a3p+1 \u2217K(%)(d\u2212p\u22121) . (2.27)\n6More formally, this follows from the Poincar\u00e9 lemma for this complex [53].\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nConservation of this charge is guaranteed if %(d\u2212p\u22121) satisfies appropriate conditions, which are described further in section 2.5. Notice that K(%) is a (d\u2212 p\u2212 1)-form and as such its Hodge dual is given by the single action of the \u2217 operator. We are now ready to write down the simplest (i.e. most relevant) action for an EFT enjoying this symmetry. The natural guess is that the action we are looking for is:\nSEFT[h] = \u222b ddxJ\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1J \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1 . (2.28)\nThe equations of motion following from (2.28) indeed produce a gapless phase, where the equation of motion is\nd2K(d\u2212p\u22121|d\u2212p\u22121) = d2 \u2217 J(p+1|p+1) \u2217 = d2 \u2217 d2h(p|p)\u2217 = 0 =\u21d2 2h(p|p) = 0 , (2.29)\nwith again a gauge-invariant version of the Laplacian. However, this equation is fourth order in derivatives! Furthermore, K(d\u2212p\u22121|d\u2212p\u22121) satisfies a different equation from J(p+1|p+1) (d2K = 0 vs. dJ = 0) which means that the emergent electric symmetry is of a slightly different character than the original symmetry. What equation of motion would give the desired two derivative equations and the corresponding electric conservation law, dK = 0? Whatever it is, must be gauge invariant so we should produce it from J(p+1|p+1). But J(p+1|p+1) already involves two derivatives of h(p|p), so we can\u2019t add any extra ones. Additionally, since ultimately we will vary an action with respect to h(p|p) \u2014 which is a (p|p)-biform \u2014 we expect that the equation of motion will also be in that representation. Sadly, J(p+1|p+1) is a (p+ 1|p+ 1)-form, so we need to add one more piece of structure that allows us to reduce the size of the representations. In a spacetime with a metric (which we have taken to be flat), we can always trace over a pair of indices, one from each column in a biform. We therefore define a trace operation:\ntr (\u00b7) : \u2126(q|p) \u2192 \u2126(q\u22121|p\u22121) , as tr (X) = \u03b7\u00b5q\u03bdpX\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5q |\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp . (2.30)\nConveniently, this trace operation (2.30) maps maximal biforms to other maximal biforms. The candidate equation of motion for an EFT with a higher biform symmetry is therefore: tr ( J(p+1|p+1) ) = tr ( d2h(p|p) ) = 0 . (2.31)\nFor p = 1, this is nothing other than the linearized Einstein equation. Furthermore, it turns out this condition exactly guarantees the conservation of the electric current. We have\ntr (dJ) = a \u2217 (d \u2217 J\u2217) \u2217+b ( d tr (J) ) , (2.32)\nwhere a and b are constants that depend on conventions for the normalization of biforms which we have not specified. Using this equation, we infer that the conditions\ndJ(p+1|p+1) = 0 and tr ( J(p+1|p+1) ) = 0 , (2.33)\nimply the following equations for the magnetic current dK(d\u2212p\u22121|d\u2212p\u22121) = 0 and d tr ( K(d\u2212p\u22121|d\u2212p\u22121) ) = 0 .

What is the action that produces this interesting equation of motion? We, of course, know the answer for p = 1: it is the Fierz-Pauli action of linearized gravity. If we did not already know about it we might be surprised by the existence of such a theory, since we have argued that the most relevant term we can write in terms of J(p+1|p+1) leads to fourth-order equations of motion. In order to produce second-order equations of motion, we require an action that contains a more relevant operator. The resolution of this apparent tension is that our desired action is actually more like the Chern-Simons example discussed in section 2.1 than the Maxwell-like construction (2.28). The surprising fact is that for EFTs of higher biform symmetries, this type of action still produces gapless phases (in high enough dimension). This is because tr (J) = 0 does not imply that the full current J = 0, for dimensions d \u2265 2p+ 2. This leaves some degrees of freedom left in the current to propagate at low energies. These Chern-Simons-like actions can be built in any dimension. In order to construct an action with equation of motion (2.31), we first have to point out the existence of an important object: a generalized Einstein (p|p)-biform, which is defined as:\nG(p|p) \u2261 p\u2211\nk=0\n(\u22121)k k + 1! k! \u03b7 k (1|1) \u2227 trk+1J(p+1|p+1) . (2.36)\nHere \u03b7(1|1) is the flat metric thought of as a fixed background (1|1) biform, the notation \u03b7k(1|1) denotes a repeated wedge product of k copies of \u03b7, and we have used the obvious wedge product of biforms given by \u2227 which produces new, higher rank biforms by appropriate (anti)symmetrization.7 The defining property of the Einstein biform is that it is automatically conserved as consequence of the original magnetic symmetry. That is, the dual conservation dJ(p+1|p+1) = 0 implies\nd \u2217G(p|p)\u2217 = 0 , (2.37)\nwhich is equivalent to the component expression \u2202\u00b51G\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp = 0. The Einstein biform is also obviously gauge invariant, since it is constructed from J(p+1|p+1). We now have enough ingredients to write what we call the Einstein EFT action (also discussed in [54]):\nSE[h] = \u222b ddxh\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdpG \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp . (2.38)\nThis action is gauge invariant, up to a boundary term \u2014 just like Chern-Simons theory. The variation of the action h(p|p) 7\u2192 h(p|p) + d\u03be(p|p\u22121) indeed vanishes due to the conservation of\n7We have chosen this product to be unnormalized, so for example X\u00b5|\u03bd \u2227 Y\u03c1|\u03c3 = X\u00b5|\u03bdY\u03c1|\u03c3 \u2212X\u03c1|\u03bdY\u00b5|\u03c3 \u2212 X\u00b5|\u03c3Y\u03c1|\u03bd +X\u03c1|\u03c3Y\u00b5|\u03bd .\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nG(p|p). The equation of motion following from (2.38) is easy to obtain:\nG(p|p) = 0 , =\u21d2 tr ( J(p+1|p+1) ) = 0 . (2.39)\nThis is a partial flatness condition on the (gauge-invariant) curvature, J(p+1|p+1), further emphasizing the similarity between the action (2.38) and Chern-Simons theory.\nWe saw from (2.31) that setting the trace of J(p+1|p+1) to zero implies a wave equation for the biform gauge potential h(p|p), and that this equation also implies the conservation of an electric biform current. Therefore the action (2.38) describes the gapless phase of a theory with both a magnetic maximal (d\u2212 p\u2212 1)-biform and an electric maximal p-biform symmetry. For p = 1, this is the action of linearized Einstein gravity, which we will study in detail further below. Here we see what the general structure of the theory is, and how it is a member of a larger set of theories. Another interesting example is provided by p = 0, which is a theory of a free scalar that falls in this same class of theories, and therefore shares many features with gravity. We will also explore the details of this theory in section 3, and will point out the subtle differences that make the EFT of this scalar somewhat different from the usual Goldstone theory for a 0-form symmetry: in a nutshell, the IR Lagrangians agree while their irrelevant corrections need not.\nIt is also interesting to consider defects charged under these symmetries. One can couple the field h(p|p) to a p-dimensional defect by contracting half of its indices with velocity vectors defined by the surface and thinking of the remaining indices as producing a p-form, which can then be integrated. It is a simple exercise to see that the resulting operator can only be gauge invariant if the defect is an extremal surface (e.g., a geodesic for p = 1) of the background geometry. This is well-known in linearized gravity [56]\u2014and generalizes to higher p \u2014 and is a strong hint that biform symmetries are related to properties of spacetime. The restriction on the possible types of charged objects can also be related to the physics of fractons [16], which we will comment on further below.\nMore irrelevant corrections to (2.38) would be of the form J2, J3, J4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . These terms8 would preserve both the gaplessness of the theory, and conservation of both the electric and magnetic currents, up to some deformation of the electric current J \u2192 J\u0302 similar to the ordinary higher-form case. Notice that, if one fine-tunes the most relevant Einstein term in this action to zero, we go back to the Maxwell-type actions discussed in (2.28). Linearized conformal gravity belongs to this class of theories.\nIt is worth underlining both the commonalities and differences between these theories and Chern-Simons theories. While they share many features, these theories remain gapless (for d \u2265 2p+ 2). One way to understand this is to note that if we think of J(p+1|p+1) as a curvature, not all of it is required to vanish on-shell, only its trace. This point of view can be related to the physics of fractons, which we explore next.\n8The precise allowed interactions depend on the value p+ 1, corresponding to the number of indices the biform has. For example, for p odd, cubic terms are allowed for a single species of biform field h(p|p), while for p even such interactions vanish as a consequence of permutation symmetry.\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1"

            "text": "The previous discussion focused primarily on the physical symmetries of the problem, which were used to construct an effective theory that describes the gapless phase where the magnetic symmetry is nonlinearly realized. In doing this, we have somewhat glossed over the discussion of the gauge symmetries. What are we really gauging here? In order to make contact with familiar physics, it is useful to repackage the previous construction in terms of curvatures built by acting with a single derivative on the gauge fields. This will amount to a first-order formulation of the theories of interest. Let\u2019s build a first-order curvature for our gauge field h as:\nQ(p+1|p) = dh(p|p) . (2.40)\nIn this setup, h(p|p) is invariant under a gauge transform of the form: h(p|p) 7\u2192 h(p|p) + d2\u03c9(p\u22121|p\u22121), where \u03c9(p\u22121|p\u22121) is a (p\u2212 1|p\u2212 1)-biform. What is this gauging? For p > 1, this symmetry necessarily acts on extended objects, but for p = 1 we can give an intuitive description: h(1|1) is a gauge field for the spatial part of a fracton field [16].\nConsider a scalar field \u03a6 transforming under an abelian symmetry as\n\u03a6 7\u2192 ei\u03b1(x)\u03a6 , (2.41)\nwhere \u03b1(x) is a linear function of the coordinates: \u03b1(x) = \u03b1+ \u03b1\u00b5x\u00b5, with \u03b1 a constant and \u03b1\u00b5 a constant vector. This symmetry is necessary to have both charge and dipole moment conservation.9 It turns out it is possible to build a quadratic combination of \u03a6 and its derivatives that transforms covariantly under this scalar fractonic symmetry.10 In detail, the combination (\n\u22022\u03a62 ) \u00b5\u03bd \u2261 \u03a6\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd\u03a6\u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u03a6\u2202\u03bd\u03a6 , (2.42)\ntransforms as ( \u22022\u03a62 ) \u00b5\u03bd 7\u2212\u2192 ei2\u03b1(x) ( \u22022\u03a62 ) \u00b5\u03bd , (2.43)\nunder (2.41) with \u03b1(x) = \u03b1 + \u03b1\u00b5x\u00b5. If one wishes to gauge this symmetry, so that the combination (2.42) transforms covariantly for all functions \u03b1(x), this can be done by introducing a symmetric gauge field h\u00b5|\u03bd and defining(\nD2\u03a62 ) \u00b5\u03bd \u2261 \u03a6\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd\u03a6\u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u03a6\u2202\u03bd\u03a6\u2212 ih\u00b5|\u03bd\u03a62 . (2.44)\nIf the gauge field transforms as\nh\u00b5|\u03bd 7\u2192 h\u00b5|\u03bd + \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd\u03b1 , (2.45) 9Theories that have higher conserved moments have also been considered. They can be constructed along similar lines to what we describe here, and would fit into a family of theories with a generalization of the biform symmetries discussed in section 2.2 to multiforms, involving tensors labeled by Young diagrams with more columns [54, 55]. The relevant representatives of that class of theories with conserved multipole ` would be the ones with symmetric tensor gauge fields, corresponding to `+ 1 columns of length 1.\n10Here we are only concerned with the space-like part of fractonic theories. In condensed matter applications, a non-relativistic time direction is also included.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nthen (2.44) will transform covariantly:( D2\u03a62 ) \u00b5\u03bd 7\u2212\u2192 ei2\u03b1(x) ( D2\u03a62 ) \u00b5\u03bd , (2.46)\nwhere \u03b1(x) is now an arbitrary function. In the language of section 2.2, h\u00b5|\u03bd is a (1|1)-biform, which transforms as h(1|1) 7\u2192 h(1|1) + d2\u03b1. Notice this is not the gauge transformation discussed in the previous section, nor is it the gauge symmetry enjoyed by linearized gravity.\nThe gauge invariant curvature associated to h(1|1) we call Q(2|1), which is defined as:\nQ(2|1) = dh(1|1) . (2.47)\nA natural question to ask is: how do we enlarge the gauge symmetry so that transformations h(1|1) 7\u2192 h(1|1) + d\u03be(1|0) are also unphysical? First, notice that Lagrangians constructed from the curvature Q(2|1) would enjoy an electric symmetry related to shifts of h(1|1) that satisfy d2\u03be(1|0) = 0. We can gauge this putative symmetry by introducing a new gauge field \u0393(2|1) and deforming the curvature Q(2|1) as:\nQ(2|1) = dh(1|1) \u2212 \u0393(2|1) . (2.48)\nWe do not want to gauge totally generic shifts of h(1|1), but just a small part. This is achieved by considering only transformations of the form\nh(1|1) 7\u2192 h(1|1) + d\u03be(1|0) , \u0393(2|1) 7\u2192 \u0393(2|1) + d2\u03be(1|0) . (2.49)\nThe shift (2.49) guarantees that a small part of the electric global symmetry will survive in the EFT. Notice that there is another curvature that we can construct purely from \u0393(2|1):\nJ(2|2) = d\u0393(2|1) , (2.50)\nwhich is gauge invariant as a consequence of the fact that d3 = 0. It seems that we are left with a new fractonic-type gauge symmetry for \u0393(2|1), since this gauge field also transforms by a term with two derivatives in (2.49). In order to recover the Einstein-like theories discussed in section 2.2, all we need to do is demand a flatness condition on Q(2|1) to relate \u0393(2|1) and h(1|1), which we could interpret as coming from an equation of motion of a BF-like action:\nQ(2|1) = 0 =\u21d2 J(2|2) = d2h(1|1) . (2.51)\nAs advertised, this construction recovers the familiar gauge invariance h(1|1) 7\u2192 h(1|1) +d\u03be(1|0) of linearized gravity. This type of gauge field was also introduced in [16], appearing in theories that violate rotational invariance, with a clear origin in lattice models. Here we have obtained this gauge theory from a further gauging of the original fracton-like symmetry. This is completely analogous to the Green-Schwarz mechanism [57] in string theory. While we have set p = 1 in our example above, the whole construction goes through for any p, provided that the fractonic matter field \u03a6 is gapped. If this is not the case, we would be forced to deal with dynamical extended objects when p > 1. It would be interesting to construct UV complete theories for p = 1 using these ingredients.\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nEven for p = 1, extended objets make an appearance. Notice that the Green-Schwarz mechanism implies that dh(1|1) is no longer gauge invariant. As such, we can\u2019t couple it to worldlines in the usual way. Let\u2019s examine this. Before introducing \u0393(2|1), the natural coupling between h\u00b5|\u03bd and an external worldline is\nS (monopole) line = \u222b h\u00b5|\u03bd\nx\u0307\u03bd\u221a x\u03072 dx\u00b5 , (2.52)\nwhere x\u0307\u00b5 = dx\u00b5d\u03c4 for some parameterization of the worldline given by \u03c4 . The expression above is manifestly diffeomorphism invariant on the worldline, as it must be. However, this coupling is only gauge invariant under h\u00b5|\u03bd 7\u2192 h\u00b5|\u03bd + \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd\u03be if dd\u03c4 ( x\u0307\u03bd\u221a x\u03072 ) = 0. This is the statement that monopoles are not mobile in fractonic theories. A dipole coupling is however possible:\nS (dipole) line = \u222b h\u00b5|\u03bd x \u03bd dx\u00b5 . (2.53)\nThis coupling is gauge invariant and possible for any trajectory x\u00b5(\u03c4). Once we include the enhanced gauge symmetry by introducing \u0393(2|1), this coupling needs to be reconsidered. Just as in string theory, gauge invariance can only be preserved by realizing the worldline as a boundary of some two-dimensional surface, \u03a3. If that is the case, we can write:\nS (dipole) surface = \u222b \u2202\u03a3 h\u00b5|\u03bd x \u03bd dx\u00b5 \u2212 \u222b \u03a3 \u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c3x\u03c3dx\u00b5 \u2227 dx\u03bd . (2.54)\nWe therefore see that the theory that includes the new gauge field \u0393(2|1) naturally includes higher dimensional defects. In the gapless gravity phase, \u0393(2|1) = dh(1|1) as a consequence of the flatness condition Q(2|1) = 0. In this situation, the coupling above disappears as it becomes identically zero. The upshot is that the extra gauging has the physical effect of removing the dipole particles from our EFT, they no longer couple to the gauge fields. All that remains are the monopoles (2.52), which are forced to move on geodesics. This builds the connection between biform symmetries and spacetime. From the perspective advocated here, this is a natural consequence of the properties of the original fractonic matter. What is the EFT which agrees with the Einstein action (2.38) in these variables? Schematically, it takes the form:\nS = \u222b ddxhG[\u0393] + \u03932 . (2.55)\nWe will write the precise form of this action for theories of interest in the following sections. The Einstein biform G above is written in terms of \u0393, rather than h. Because of this, it is not automatically conserved and gauge invariance requires the introduction of \u03932 terms, with a precise structure that we will write explicitly in the later sections. The only possible gauge-invariant equations of motion are of course the flatness conditions\nG(1|1) = 0 , Q(2|1) = 0 . (2.56)\nThis amounts to a first order formalism for the theories described in the previous section. When describing linearized gravity, there is a simple and familiar interpretation for these biforms: \u0393(2|1) is related to the usual Christoffel connection and Q(2|1) is the nonmetricity tensor, which is set to zero here.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1"

            "text": "Within the space of maximal biforms \u2126\u0302, there is one more family of interesting theories that can be studied. Consider as our starting point a (p+ 1|p)-biform current H(p+1|p) satisfying\ndH(p+1|p) = 0 . (2.57)\nThis example differs from the previous case in that H(p+1|p) is what we called an odd biform. The important change is that the naive form of the Poincar\u00e9 lemma that we used above does not hold [53]. In order to see this, we need to leave the space of maximal forms. While the interested reader can find the full details in [53], we will sketch here only the necessary machinery. We have to refine the concept of exterior derivative and allow it to act on either the left or right column of the Young tableaux, when this is possible. As such we define both left and right differentials:\ndL : \u2126(p|q) \u2192 \u2126(p+1|q) , \u2200p \u2265 q , dR : \u2126(p|q) \u2192 \u2126(p|q+1) , \u2200p \u2265 q + 1 . (2.58)\nThe fact that dR does not act on even biforms, and at the same time even forms are not in the image of dL is why we did not need this technology in the previous section.\nWith this refinement, rather than (2.57) what we need to impose is the two equations\ndLH(p+1|p) = 0 , dRH(p+1|p) = 0 , (2.59)\nin order to guarantee that we can write H(p+1|p) in terms of a (p|p \u2212 1)-biform gauge potential as\nH(p+1|p) = dLdR a(p|p\u22121) . (2.60)\nThe conditions (2.59) just guarantee that \u2217H(p+1|p)\u2217 is conserved when taking the divergence with respect to an index in either of its two columns. This family of theories enjoys a more general gauge symmetry of the form a(p|p\u22121) 7\u2192 a(p|p\u22121) + dL\u03be(p\u22121|p\u22121) + dR\u03c7(p|p\u22122). Having already left the space of maximal biforms \u2126\u0302, we see that these theories are not very different conceptually from having started with H being a totally generic (p|q)-biform. We will not study this totally general case here, nevertheless there is a very simple and interesting example of this family of theories that we will treat in more detail in appendix C, that we briefly describe. Consider the case where H(2|1) is a (2|1)-biform, which is the simplest nontrivial example. In this case, notice that a(1|0) has the simple gauge symmetry a(1|0) 7\u2192 a(1|0) + dL\u03be, with \u03be a scalar, since no (1|0)-biform sits in the image of dR. Given this simple gauge transformation, it is natural to suspect we are dealing with a familiar theory. Notice that the version of the Einstein biform which is relevant in this case is\nS(1|0) = tr ( H(2|1) ) . (2.61)\nIn components this reads S\u00b5 = \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c1a\u00b5 \u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03c1a\u03c1 . (2.62)\nIt can be easily checked that S\u00b5 is automatically conserved, \u2202\u00b5S\u00b5 = 0. From this, we can immediately write the Einstein action for these objects:\nSE [a] = \u222b ddx a\u00b5S\u00b5 , (2.63)\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nwhich yields the equation of motion S\u00b5 = 0 . (2.64)\nWhat is this equation? Notice that, because of the reduced gauge symmetry of this particular case, there is another gauge invariant curvature:\nF(2|0) = dLa(1|0) , (2.65)\nsuch that we have H(2|1) = dRF(2|0). Then, the equations of motion (2.64) are nothing other than the Maxwell equations\n\u2202\u00b5F \u00b5\u03bd = 0 . (2.66)\nWe have thus obtained electromagnetism as a simple example of a non-maximal biform theory with an Einstein-type Lagrangian! Notice that this similarity is lost once the theory is written directly in terms of F . Of course, the irrelevant terms that we can add to this EFT are not the same if we restrict ourselves to observables that can only be expressed in terms of H. This is analogous to the different treatments of the scalar theory as a biform (i.e., Galileon superfluid) or single form (i.e., ordinary superfluid) theory discussed in section 3. We comment further on this in appendix C below."

Taking the divergence of the equation above and using the conservation of J(p+1|p+1) we find:\n\u2202\u00b51J (\u03b6) \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1 = 0 =\u21d2 J\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1\u2202 \u00b51\u03b6\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1 = 0 . (2.69)\nFrom the point of view of representation theory, J(p+1|p+1) is a an irreducible (p+ 1|p+ 1)- biform. Therefore, equation (2.69) carries no information about the totally antisymmetric (p+ 2)-form dL\u03b6(p+1), its contraction with J(p+1|p+1) vanishes automatically by symmetry. It does contain, however, information about the other irreducible possibility dR\u03b6(p+1), which is a (p+ 1|1)-biform. We will further require our current to be traceless, as is the case on-shell in the EFTs we studied above. In biform language we can then write the following constraint on \u03b6(p+1), that will ensure conservation of J (\u03b6):\n(dR\u03b6)(p+1|1) = ( \u03b7 \u2227 \u03b3(p) ) (p+1|1) , (2.70)\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nwhere \u03b3(p) is some p-form \u2014 which we write below \u2014 that, when combined via the wedge product with the metric, produces a (p+ 1|1)-biform. In component notation we can write:\n\u2202\u00b5\u03b6\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1 + 1\np+ 1 p+1\u2211 i=1 \u2202\u03bdi\u03b6\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1 = p+ 2 (d\u2212 p)(p+ 1) p+1\u2211 i=1 g\u00b5\u03bdi\u2202 \u03c1\u03b6\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1 . (2.71)\nHere we have determined \u03b3(p) by taking the trace of (2.70) and demanding consistency. The equation (2.71) is the generalization of the conformal Killing equation to a (p+ 1)-form. The (p+ 1)-forms that solve this equation are sometimes referred as conformal Killing-Yano tensors. In flat space, this equation can be solved by acting with derivatives and contracting appropriately to obtain the equation\n\u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3\u2202\u00b5\u03b6\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1 = 0 , (2.72)\nthat a conformal Killing (p + 1)-form must satisfy. The most general solution to this auxiliary equation that is compatible with the original conformal Killing equation (2.71) is given by\n\u03b6\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1 = A (p+1) \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1 +B (p+2) \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+2x \u00b5p+2 + ( p\u2211 i=1 C (p) \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5i\u22121\u00b5p+1\u00b5i+1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5px\u00b5i \u2212 C (p) \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5px\u00b5p+1 )\n+ D(p+1)\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1x2 \u2212 2 p+1\u2211 i=1 x\u00b5iD (p+1) \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5i\u22121\u03c3\u00b5i+1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1x \u03c3  , (2.73)\nwhere A(q), B(q), C(q), and D(q) are constant q-forms. Notice that A is analogous to translations, B to rotations, C to dilations, and D to special conformal transformations. This general solution can be cast in a nicer form in terms of the standard CFT embedding of Rd into Rd+2 with metric \u03b7AB = diag(\u22121, 1, \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd), XA(x) = ( 1+x2 2 , 1\u2212x2 2 , x \u00b5 ) . In these variables, the conformal Killing tensors can be written as\n\u03b6\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1 = KA1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ap+1Ap+2 \u2202XA1 \u2202x\u00b51 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2202X Ap+1 \u2202x\u00b5p+1 XAp+2 , (2.74)\nwhere KA1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ap+2 is a constant (p+ 2)\u2212form in the (d+ 2)\u2212dimensional embedding space. Upon dimensional reduction to the physical d-dimensional space, the (p+2)\u2212form K breaks up into (p + 2)\u2212form, 2 different (p + 1)\u2212forms and a p-form, which are precisely the coefficients B(p+2), A(p+1), D(p+1), C(p). We are interested in these equations when d \u2265 2p+ 2, since in lower dimensions our theories of interest are gapped. Something special happens in the equations above when d = 2p+ 2. For p = 0, we have a free scalar CFT2 and there exist an infinite number of solutions to the conformal Killing equation giving rise to a Kac-Moody current algebra. For higher values of p, the solutions (2.73) are still the full set of solutions. Nevertheless, the structure of the equations is different in these special dimensions and the solutions further satisfy the Laplace equation:\n\u2202\u03c1\u2202 \u03c1\u03b6\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1 = 0 when d = 2p+ 2 . (2.75)\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nFor electromagnetism in d = 4, it was found that the special structure of the equations leads to the existence of 0-form symmetries which also imply the existence of Kac-Moody algebra [6]. This suggests that d = 4 linearized gravity might also enjoy a symmetry enhancement for lower codimension charges. An explicit construction of these charges could possibly arise from the double copy techniques in gravity [58]. Soft graviton theorems can already be viewed as an example of this enhanced symmetry structure [59].\nIn conclusion, we have seen that charges for theories with maximal higher biform symmetries are labeled by conformal Killing-Yano forms. Given a current satisfying d \u2217 J(p+1|p+1)\u2217 = 0 and tr(J(p+1|p+1)) = 0, conserved charges are given by:\nQ(\u03b6)(\u03a3d\u2212p\u22121) = \u222b\n\u03a3d\u2212p\u22121 \u2217J (\u03b6)(p+1) . (2.76)\nNotice that some of these charges might be trivial. Indeed, provided there are not topological features and that the fundamental fields are globally well defined, it is not hard to see that only \u03b6s satisfying \u2202\u03c1\u03b6\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp\u03c1 6= 0 will yield nontrivial charges. The rest just give total derivatives. In the language of the conformal group, the nontrivial generators are the ones that are not part of the Poincar\u00e9 group, i.e., the dilations and special conformal transformations. For us, it is the C(p) andD(p+1) that parameterize the non-trivial charges.11\nIt is relatively easy to see the origin of these conserved quantities. The Einstein type actions we consider turn out to be invariant under the global symmetry generated by\nh\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp 7\u2192 h\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp + Y(p|p) \u2202 \u03c1 (\u03b6\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p\u03c1 \u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp) , (2.77)\nwhere Y(p|p) is the Young projector onto a (p|p)-biform, and \u03b6(p+1) is a conformal Killing (p+ 1)-form. It is clear that this transformation is only nontrivial when \u2202\u03c1\u03b6\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p\u03c1 6= 0. The divergence of a conformal Killing (p+ 1)-form is at most linear in the coordinates, so the current J(p+1|p+1) = d2h(p|p) is manifestly invariant under this global transformation. It is then easy to see that this implies all Einstein and Maxwell-type terms are invariant under this symmetry.\nMagnetic charges can be constructed in similar fashion. Notice, however, that our magnetic current is not generically traceless. In that case, looking at (2.27), we must demand a more constraining Killing type equation for %:\n\u2202\u00b5%\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1 + 1\np+ 1 p+1\u2211 i=1 \u2202\u03bdi%\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp+1 = 0 , (2.78)\nwhich has the smaller set of solutions:\n%\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1 = A (p+1) \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+1 +B (p+2) \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p+2x \u00b5p+2 . (2.79) 11We stress again that this is the case if there are no topological defects. In many cases these defects would not be allowed. But in the critical dimension d = 2p+ 2, they can appear as part of the magnetic symmetries. See section 4.5 for such an example.\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nCoupling to gauge fields and anomalies. In what follows, we would like to couple these theories to background gauge fields that gauge the symmetries (2.77). In order to that, we let our fundamental field h(p|p) shift by the divergence of an arbitrary (p+ 1|p)-biform as:\nh\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp 7\u2192 h\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp + Y(p|p) \u2202 \u03c1\u039b\u03c1\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp , (2.80)\nand demand our actions are invariant by the addition of appropriate compensating gauge fields. We do this in detail in the following sections for the cases of interest, including linearized gravity. Schematically, the expectation is that the curvatures get nonlinearly gauged by the addition of background (p+ 1|p+ 1)-biform fields C(p+1|p+1):12\nJ(p+1|p+1) \u2192 J(p+1|p+1) \u2261 J(p+1|p+1) \u2212 C(p+1|p+1) . (2.81)\nThis background gauge field transforms as C(p+1|p+1) 7\u2192 C(p+1|p+1) + d2 \u2202 \u00b7 \u039b(p+1|p) under gauge transformations. Already at this level, it is clear that this will lead to a mixed anomaly with the magnetic conservation equation since:\ndJ(p+1|p+1) = \u2212dC(p+1|p+1) 6= 0 . (2.82)\nThis anomaly is directly responsible for protecting the gaplessness of this phase, as was studied for superfluids in [5]. In the following, we extend the arguments to linearized gravity, showing how it can be interpreted as a gapless phase defined by a particular structure of mixed anomalies. It turns out that (2.81) is not quite the end of the story. There are two interlocked reasons for this. The first is that we would expect gauge fields that act as sources for the electric current (2.17) to transform by something that has a single derivative of the gauge parameter \u039b(p+1|p), in order to couple to a conserved current satisfying d \u2217 J(p+1|p+1)\u2217 = 0. The second is that the Einstein term is no longer invariant under the original symmetries, parameterized by conformal Killing (p+ 1)-forms, once we gauge as in (2.81). We expect this not to be allowed for abelian symmetries. It turns out that the way out of both puzzles is that C(p+1|p+1) must be constructed as:\nC(p+1|p+1) \u223c d ( \u2202 \u00b7A(p+1|p+1) ) , (2.83)\nwhere A(p+1|p+1) is also a (p + 1|p + 1)-biform. The equation (2.83) is just schematic; explicit expression are written for the examples of interest below. For transformations of the form (2.77), A(p+1|p+1) shifts by a term proportional to the conformal Killing equation, guaranteeing both invariance under global symmetries and that the gauge field transforms by something linear in derivatives.\n3 Superfluids\nWe begin by describing the simplest theory that exhibits a biform symmetry. This is a scalar theory which can be thought of as a somewhat peculiar kind of superfluid that has a\n12Throughout this work, we will denote currents before the introduction of background gauge fields with capital roman letters and their gauge-invariant counterparts with calligraphic capital letters.\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\n0-biform symmetry. We first review the ordinary superfluid case from the perspective that it is a gapless phase protected by anomalies, as was considered in [5]. We then add a new twist to the superfluid discussion by considering a 0-biform superfluid, which is related to the physics of Galileons [60] which share many of the features of gravity [61]. This galileon superfluid theory belongs to the same class of theories as gravity, and shares a number of features with linearized gravity, making it a useful illustrative example. Both the ordinary superfluid and the galileon superfluid are members of a broader class of theories that could be called fractonic superfluids. All of these theories agree in the deep infrared, and correspondingly have the same scalar gapless degree of freedom. The theories differ in their symmetries, which are of the form \u03b4\u03c6 = c\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5Nx\u00b51 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7x\u00b5N , where c\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5N is a traceless tensor. (The ordinary superfluid has the N = 0 symmetry and the galileon superfluid additionally has the N = 1 symmetry.) The theories have different allowed irrelevant deformations depending on the maximal value of N which is a symmetry. From the operator perspective, the fundamental conserved currents in these theories are J\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5N+1 , and in the deep infrared are given by J\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5N+1 = \u2202\u00b51 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2202\u00b5N+1\u03c6. The fact that all of these theories agree in the deep IR \u2014 or equivalently that all of these currents propagate a gapless scalar \u2014 is a manifestation of the so-called inverse Higgs effect, where a single Goldstone degree of freedom nonlinearly realizes several spacetime symmetries [62]."

In [5] it was shown how this classification scheme can also be usefully applied to systems with spontaneously broken global symmetries, providing an alternative viewpoint on Goldstone\u2019s theorem. In this spirit, following [5] we define a superfluid as a phase involving two conserved currents with a mixed \u2019t Hooft anomaly. The effective field theory has two conserved currents: one is an ordinary 1-form Noether current, J\u00b5, associated to a 0-form symmetry. The other current is a (d\u22121)-form K\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22121 , and is associated to a (d\u2212 2)-form symmetry. In the standard presentation of the theory, this latter current is usually called topological, but \u2014 as was discussed in section 2\u2014this depends on the variables that we choose to parameterize the theory.\n13We are slightly abusing terminology, strictly speaking the hydrodynamics of a superfluid is described by expanding the effective field theory that we will construct around a finite density configuration [63]. See [5] for the details of how this works in this context.\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nWe now want to gauge one of these symmetries, and we can choose which one. The standard way to do this is to introduce a background gauge field that couples to the symmetry currents. Upon turning on a background gauge field for one symmetry current, the other current will cease to be conserved. The fact that its conservation equation becomes anomalous captures the impossibility of simultaneously gauging both symmetries. If we choose to gauge the ordinary U(1) shift symmetry by introducing a 1-form background gauge field A\u00b5, we need to improve both the ordinary U(1) current and the higher-form current in order to make them gauge invariant. We will denote these gaugeinvariant currents by J \u00b5 and K\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22121 , respectively. Because we have decided to source J \u00b5 by A\u00b5, conservation of this current will be maintained: \u2202\u00b5J \u00b5 = 0. On the other hand, this gauge improvement will spoil the conservation of K\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22121 ; we instead have\n\u2202\u00b5J \u00b5 = 0 , \u2202[\u00b5 \u2217 K\u03bd] = \u2212 1 2F\u00b5\u03bd , (3.1)\nwhere F\u00b5\u03bd = 2\u2202[\u00b5A\u03bd] is the usual field strength, so that the anomaly is gauge invariant, as it must be.14 Here we have dualized the K current for convenience, so that its conservation corresponds to the vanishing of the exterior derivative of \u2217K. Note that \u2014 unlike axialtype anomalies \u2014 this mixed anomaly between U(1) and U(1)(d\u22122) symmetries is not dimension-dependent, and can occur in any spacetime dimension. The equation where the anomaly appears is always a choice, and so we can choose to put the anomaly in the J \u00b5 conservation equation if we like. This is achieved by gauging the (d\u2212 2)-form symmetry by introducing a (d\u2212 1)-form background gauge field, B\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd\u22121 . In this case, the conservation equations instead read\n\u2202\u00b5J \u00b5 = \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u2202\u00b51B\u00b52\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d , \u2202[\u00b5 \u2217 K\u03bd] = 0 , (3.2)\nwhere \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u2202\u00b51B\u00b52\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d is the (Hodge dual of the) field strength associated to the higherform gauge field.

This requires that the two free functions in (3.3) are related as c2(p2) = \u2212c1(p2). The residual freedom to select c1(p2) is then fixed by the anomaly equation (3.1), which when differentiated with respect to the background fields to get the two-point function and written in momentum space, requires the failure of conservation to be purely analytic in p (corresponding to a position space contact term),\np[\u03c1 \u3008J|\u00b5|(p) \u2217K\u03bd](\u2212p)\u3009 = \u2212p[\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd]\u00b5 .

(3.5)\nThe conservation of J\u00b5 holds exactly (i.e., even at coincident points), while the dual conservation of \u2217K\u03bd holds only at separated points. The failure of K\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22121 to be conserved at coincident points due to a contact term is precisely the statement that there is an \u2019t Hooft anomaly between the symmetries that these currents correspond to.\n\u2022 The (d\u2212 1)-form current is conserved: we can instead require that K\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22121 is conserved even at coincident points. This forces us to set c2(p2) = 0 in (3.3). It is then not possible to make J\u00b5 identically conserved. The anomaly equation (3.2), when differentiated with respect to the background fields to get the two-point function and written in momentum space, requires the failure of conservation to be the particular contact term\np\u00b5 \u3008J\u00b5(p) \u2217K\u03bd(\u2212p)\u3009 = p\u03bd .

However, the nonlocal part of the correlator, which controls the behavior at separated points, is identical. This part is universal in any theory with these conserved currents, and will be the part that tells us the theory has a massless mode."

As we saw in the previous section, our two possible choices for which current is conserved merely serve to shift the contact term appearing in the correlator, but in both cases the nonlocal part is the same. In order to perform a K\u00e4ll\u00e9n-Lehmann decomposition, it is convenient to dualize one of the currents so that the two operators in the correlator have the same number of Lorentz indices. It is more convenient to dualize K\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22121 to a vector, so we will do that in the following. As we elaborate on in appendix A, only the nonlocal part is necessary to deduce the spectrum of the theory, the spectral decomposition is insensitive to what contact terms are present in the theory. We can therefore take the correlator in the form (3.7). Our starting point is the spectral representation of the current two-point function (see appendix A for details of its derivation)\n\u3008J\u00b5(p) \u2217K\u03bd(\u2212p)\u3009 = \u222b \u221e\n0 ds s p2 + s\n[ \u03c11(s)\u03a0\u0303(1)\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 \u03c10(s)\u03a0\u0303(0)\u00b5\u03bd ] . (3.8)\nHere \u03c10(s) and \u03c11(s) are the spin-0 and spin-1 spectral densities, which tell us about the presence of spin 0 and spin 1 states that couple to the currents (note that only a massive spin-1 field can couple to a conserved current [66\u201368], so the spectral density \u03c11 must go to zero as s\u2192 0), and the projectors are defined as\n\u03a0\u0303(0)\u00b5\u03bd = \u2212 p\u00b5p\u03bd s , \u03a0\u0303(1)\u00b5\u03bd = \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd + p\u00b5p\u03bd s , (3.9)\nwhich are related to the usual projectors\n\u03a0(0)\u00b5\u03bd = p\u00b5p\u03bd p2 , \u03a0(1)\u00b5\u03bd = \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 p\u00b5p\u03bd p2 , (3.10)\nby the replacement p2 \u2192 \u2212s, and agree with them on-shell where p2 = \u2212s. We can then rewrite (3.8) as\n\u3008J\u00b5(p) \u2217K\u03bd(\u2212p)\u3009 = \u222b \u221e\n0\nds p2 + s\n[ s\u03c11(s)\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd + ( \u03c11(s) + \u03c10(s) ) p\u00b5p\u03bd ] .

(3.12) 15Note that in performing the spectral decomposition, the distinction between the actual projectors given in (3.10) and the off-shell projectors (3.9), along with the constraint that \u03c11 \u2192 0 as s \u2192 0, are crucial. Notice that the two-point function with different contact terms can be written directly in terms of projectors. For example, we can write (3.7) as \u3008J\u00b5 \u2217K\u03bd\u3009 = \u03a0(0)\u00b5\u03bd and (3.5) as \u3008J\u00b5 \u2217K\u03bd\u3009 = \u2212\u03a0(1)\u00b5\u03bd , respectively. This would seem to suggest that when we perform the spectral decomposition, we could actually decompose this latter correlator in terms of spin-1 states, implying a massless spin-1 mode instead of a spin-0 one. However, because of the constraint that \u03c11 has no support at s = 0, it is impossible to reproduce the two-point function with \u03c11(s) \u223c \u03b4(s).\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nThat is, we see that there is a massless spin-0 mode in the spectrum as a consequence of the structure of anomalies, and furthermore, no other states contribute to the two-point function.16 The local contact term does not affect the spectral functions (see appendix A), so regardless of the choices made in where to put the anomaly, there is a gapless mode, establishing a version of a Goldstone theorem [5]."

Once we have a handle on this theory and its symmetry structure, we invert the logic and study its anomalies and universal current-current two-point function.

The EFT expansion is then organized in terms of J\u00b5|\u03bd via contractions of the form ( J\u00b5|\u03bd [s] )n (excepting WZ terms \u2014 see Footnote 18), distinguishing this theory from the ordinary superfluid EFT. 18In addition to these interactions \u2014 which are exactly invariant under the relevant global symmetries \u2014 there are interactions with fewer derivatives that are also invariant up to a total derivative. These are known as the Galileon interactions [60], and can be thought of as Wess-Zumino (WZ) terms for the spontaneous breaking of the symmetries [72].

Recall that the currents J\u00b5|\u03bd and K\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22121|\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd\u22121 satisfy the following equations on-shell (and at separated points)\ntr J = 0 , \u2202\u00b5J\u00b5|\u03bd = 0 , \u2202[\u03c1 \u2217K\u2217\u00b5]|\u03bd = 0 ,\n(3.38)\nwhere the condition on \u2217K\u2217 is the dualization of the conservation of the magnetic current K(d\u22121|d\u22121). In the presence of the background gauge field A\u00b5|\u03bd , it is impossible to satisfy all of these conditions on shell. This is the expression of a mixed anomaly between the electric and magnetic symmetries. The two anomalous conservation conditions are the trace condition on the electric current\ntrJ = a [ 1\u2212 d+ \u03ba(d\u2212 2) ]( \u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2A \u03b1|\u03b2 \u2212 A ) , (3.39)\nand the conservation of the magnetic current, which can be expressed as\n\u2202[\u03c1 \u2217 K\u2217\u00b5]|\u03bd = \u2212\u2202[\u03c1C\u00b5]|\u03bd , (3.40)\nwhere we have defined the tensor C\u00b5|\u03bd \u2261 2\u03ba ( \u2202\u03b1\u2202(\u00b5A\u03bd)|\u03b1 \u2212\n1 2 A\u00b5|\u03bd\n) \u2212 (\u03ba\u2212 1)\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd ( \u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2A\u03b1|\u03b2 \u2212 A ) . (3.41)\nThe condition \u2202\u00b5J\u00b5|\u03bd = 0 continues to hold even in the presence of the background gauge field. It is straightforward to check that the right hand sides of both (3.39) and (3.40) are gauge invariant, as they must be. From these expressions, we see first that there is no choice of g, \u03ba that makes these conservation conditions exact, which will end up being an anomaly in the theory. We further see a conceptual difference between d = 2 and d > 2. In generic dimension, it is possible to choose \u03ba to make J\u00b5|\u03bd traceless, while this is not possible in d = 2. We therefore treat these two cases separately in the following.\n\u2022 d > 2 : in generic dimension, it is convenient to set\n\u03ba = d\u2212 1 d\u2212 2 , (3.42)\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nalong with g = 1/d. In this case, we find both that the right-hand side of (3.39) vanishes and that the anomalous conservation equation (3.40) can be written in terms of the traceless part of A(T )\u00b5|\u03bd :\nC(d)\u00b5|\u03bd = d\u2212 1 d\u2212 2\n[ 2\u2202\u03b1\u2202(\u00b5A (T ) \u03bd)|\u03b1 \u2212 A (T ) \u00b5|\u03bd \u2212 1 d\u2212 1\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202 \u03b1\u2202\u03b2A (T ) \u03b1|\u03b2 ] , (3.43)\nwhere A(T )\u00b5|\u03bd \u2261 A\u00b5|\u03bd \u2212 1 d\u03b7\u00b5\u03bdA. This is the minimal presentation of the anomaly, where the only anomalous equation is the conservation of K(d\u22121|d\u22121). This makes clear that the mixed anomaly is between the electric and magnetic symmetries responsible for the conservation of these currents.\n\u2022 d = 2 : in two spacetime dimensions, there is a further trace anomaly. Since \u03ba multiplies d \u2212 2 in (3.39), we can no longer choose it to make the trace of J\u00b5|\u03bd vanish.20 In this case, the currents satisfy the equations\ntrJ = a C(2) ,\n\u2202\u00b5J\u00b5|\u03bd = 0 , \u2202[\u03c1 \u2217 K\u2217\u00b5]|\u03bd = \u2212\u2202[\u03c1C (2) \u00b5]|\u03bd ,\n(3.44)\nwhere the field strengths appearing on the right hand sides are\nC(2) = \u2212\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2A\u03b1|\u03b2 + A , (3.45)\nalong with (3.41), and there is no choice of the free parameters that makes either of them vanish. Notice that the gauge-invariant tensor (3.45) is proportional to the linearized Ricci tensor in gravity if we interpret A\u00b5|\u03bd as a metric perturbation, so that we have effectively coupled our Galileon theory to a background linearized geometry.\nIn both cases, the combined (anomalous) conservation equations are sufficient to completely fix the two-point function involving the conserved currents J(1|1) and K(d\u22121|d\u22121), as we demonstrate explicitly in section 3.2.3. However, we first show how one can reproduce the structure of anomalies described here starting directly from an action principle for the free scalar.\nGauging the action. We can now write a gauge-invariant action that reproduces this universal physics as\nS = \u2212a \u222b ddx [ \u03c6 ( \u2202\u00b5s\u00b5 \u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdA\u00b5|\u03bd + g A ) + 12s\u00b5s \u00b5 \u2212 \u03ba\u2202\u00b5A\u00b5|\u03b1\u2202\u03bdA\u03bd|\u03b1\n+ \u03ba2\u2202\u00b5A\u03bd|\u03b1\u2202 \u00b5A\u03bd|\u03b1 + (\u03ba+ g \u2212 1)\u2202\u00b5A\u2202\u03bdA\u00b5|\u03bd \u2212 1 2 ( \u03ba+ g2 \u2212 1 ) \u2202\u00b5A\u2202 \u00b5A ] ,\n(3.46) which is the most general action coupling A\u00b5|\u03bd to \u03c6 that is invariant under the gauge transformations (3.32), (3.33) and (3.36). It is worth noting that the equation of motion\n20One way to understand this is to note that the tensor (3.43) (after multiplying through by d \u2212 2) is accidentally gauge invariant in d = 2, and so cannot be used to gauge the current J(1|1).\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nfor s\u00b5 is unchanged by the presence of the background gauge field (reflecting the fact that the curvature Q is already gauge invariant), and still sets s\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5\u03c6. From the action (3.46) we can extract gauge-invariant versions of the analogue of the Einstein tensor (which is a scalar in this case) and the conserved current J(1|1) as\nG = \u03b4S \u03b4\u03c6 , (3.47)\nJ\u00b5|\u03bd = \u03b4S\n\u03b4A\u00b5|\u03bd . (3.48)\nExplicitly, we find that the Einstein scalar is given by G = \u2212a ( \u2202\u00b5s\u00b5 \u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdA\u00b5|\u03bd + g A ) , (3.49)\nwhile the gauge-invariant current is J\u00b5|\u03bd = a ( \u2202(\u00b5\u2202\u03bd)\u03c6\u2212 g \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd \u03c6\u2212 C\u00b5|\u03bd ) , (3.50)\nwhere the tensor C\u00b5|\u03bd is the same as in (3.35). This current is the same as the one in (3.31). The gauge invariance of the action guarantees that J\u00b5|\u03bd will be conserved on-shell. But its trace does not vanish for generic parameter choices, and is instead given by (3.39). In this simple example, we can see that J(1|1) = a \u2217 K\u2217(1|1), so the topological magnetic current is essentially the same as the electric current. We can then read off the anomalous conservation condition from the definition of J , which reproduces exactly (3.40). For d 6= 2, there is a further simplification of the action (3.46) that can be effected by choosing \u03ba as in (3.42) and setting g = 1/d. With this choice, the trace A completely decouples and the action (3.46) becomes\nS=\u2212a \u222b ddx [ \u03c6 ( \u2202\u00b5s\u00b5\u2212\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdA(T )\u00b5|\u03bd ) + 12s\u00b5s \u00b5+ d\u22121 d\u22122 (1 2 ( \u2202\u00b5A (T ) \u03bd|\u03b1 )2 \u2212 ( \u2202\u00b5A (T ) \u00b5|\u03b1 )2)] , (d 6= 2),\n(3.51)\nwhere A(T )\u00b5|\u03bd is the traceless part of A\u00b5|\u03bd . As a consequence of the fact that only the traceless part of A(1|1) couples to the dynamical fields, the current J\u00b5|\u03bd is now traceless off-shell. This simplification does not take place in d = 2, and is an action-level manifestation of the trace anomaly discussed above. There is an elegant simplification of the action (3.46) in second-order form. If we eliminate s\u00b5 using its equation of motion, we can write\nS = 12\n\u222b ddx ( \u03c6G +A\u00b5|\u03bdJ\u00b5|\u03bd ) . (3.52)\nVarying this action with respect to \u03c6 produces (3.49), where we write s\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5\u03c6, while varying with respect to A\u00b5|\u03bd produces (3.50). As emphasized before, these results, although obtained from an EFT, are completely universal. In the next section we compute the current-current correlation functions using the symmetry structure alone and reproduce the pattern of anomalies discovered above. We then go on to prove that this symmetry structure implies the gaplessness of the phase, which is therefore protected by the anomalies found.\n\u2013 32 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1"

They depend on s and reduce to the projectors when s\u2192 \u2212p2.\nGiven the tensors (3.61)\u2013(3.63), we can write (3.57) quite economically as\n\u3008J\u00b51|\u00b52 \u2217K\u2217\u03bd1|\u03bd2\u3009 = d\u2212 1 d\u2212 2p 2\u03a0(2)\u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd2 . (3.64)\nThe way that s appears and the fact that \u03c11(s) and \u03c12(s) must go to zero as s\u2192 0 means that there is a unique way to match (3.64), which is to set\n\u03c12(s) = 0 , \u03c11(s) = 0 , \u03c10(s) = d\u2212 1 d \u03b4(s) . (3.65)\nFrom the spectral densities (3.65), we see that there is a gapless scalar in the spectrum. Further, since position space contact terms do not affect the spectral functions (as is discussed in appendix A), this will be the case regardless of where we choose to put the anomaly. We therefore conclude that there must always be a gapless scalar in the spectrum, whose presence is a consequence of the symmetry and anomaly structure of the currents."

            "text": "What defines a theory of gravity? A common response is that gravitational theories are those that respect general coordinate invariance. However, this is a statement about the gauge redundancies in our description of the physics, and so cannot be the true essence of gravity. A slightly better answer is that gravitational theories are those with a massless spin-2 particle in the spectrum, since powerful uniqueness results imply that the interactions of such a theory will be those of Einstein gravity, assuming it mediates a \u223c r\u22122 force between point-like matter sources [74\u201376]. Despite being correct, this answer is somewhat incomplete, because gaplessness is itself something to be explained. A ubiquitous source of gapless modes is symmetry breaking. Goldstone\u2019s theorem guarantees that systems with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries will possess massless excitations. It is therefore natural to ask whether a similar explanation can underly the appearance of a\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nmassless spin-2 field in gravitational theories. The relevant symmetries necessarily belong to the family of biform symmetries discussed in section 2.2, and so we want to understand how gravity fits into this picture. In this section, we explore these questions. We will see that linearized gravity can be defined as a gapless phase with two conserved currents\nJ\u00b51\u00b52|\u03bd1\u03bd2 , and K\u00b51\u00b52\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22122|\u03bd1\u03bd2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd\u22122 , (4.1)\nwhere J(2|2) is a (2|2)-biform \u2014 which is traceless on-shell \u2014 and K(d\u22122|d\u22122) is a (d\u22122|d\u22122)biform. Importantly, there is a mixed anomaly between the conservation conditions of these currents: turning on a background gauge field source for J(2|2) causes K(d\u22122|d\u22122) to no longer be conserved, and vice versa. In the deep infrared, the currents are related in a simple way as J(2|2) = a \u2217K(d\u22122|d\u22122)\u2217, so we can phrase the mixed anomaly in terms of J(2|2) alone. We can think of linearized gravity as being the phase defined by the following equations in the IR21\nJ \u00b5\u03bd|\u00b5\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\u2202\u00b5J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 , \u2202[\u03c1 \u2217 K\u2217\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u2202[\u03c1C\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 , (4.2)\nwhere J(2|2) is a gauge-invariant improvement of J(2|2) in the presence of a background gauge field. The first line of (4.2) expresses the tracelessness of J(2|2). The first equation on the second line is the conservation of J(2|2) and the second equation is the manifestation of the mixed \u2019t Hooft anomaly between the (2|2)-biform global symmetry generated by J and the (d\u2212 2|d\u2212 2)-biform symmetry related to K. In the presence of a source A(2|2) for the current J(2|2), conservation of K(d\u22122|d\u22122) is lost, and the non-conservation is proportional to the field strength of this gauge field.22 Much as we saw for superfluids, the two-point function between the operators J and K will be completely fixed by these equations. Then, upon performing a K\u00e4ll\u00e9n-Lehmann decomposition, we will infer the presence of a gapless spin-2 mode (the graviton) in the spectrum of the theory in this phase. In order to realize this physics via a quantum field theory, we have to represent the current J(2|2) in terms of local fields so that the conditions (4.2) follow from the equations of motion. To do this, we introduce the two curvatures\nJ\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03c3 \u2261 a 2 ( \u2202\u03c1\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c3 \u2212 \u2202\u03c3\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 ) , (4.3)\nQ\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 \u2261 \u2202[\u00b5h\u03bd]\u03c1 \u2212 1 2\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 , (4.4)\n21These equations are valid for d > 4. For d = 4 there is additionally an interesting anomaly in the trace condition for J , which we discuss further in the following.\n22In detail, the gauge-invariant field strength dC(2|2) is built from the background gauge field for J(2|2), A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 , as the exterior derivative of\nC\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 = d\u2212 3 d\u2212 4Y(2|2)\n( \u2202\u03c3\u2202\u03b2A (T ) \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3 \u2212\n1 4 A (T ) \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 + 3 2(d\u2212 3)\u03b7\u03b1\u03b2\u2202 \u03c1\u2202\u03c3A(T )\u00b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03c3 ) where Y(2|2) is the young projector onto the (2|2) Young diagram corresponding to a (2|2)-biform, and A(T ) is the traceless part of the gauge field A(2|2).\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nwhere \u0393(2|1) is a (2|1)-biform and h\u00b5\u03bd is a symmetric tensor (a (1|1)-biform). Note that this necessarily introduces linearized diffeomorphism invariance, as these curvatures are gauge invariant under the transformations\n\u03b4h\u00b5\u03bd = 2\u2202(\u00b5\u03be\u03bd) , \u03b4\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 2\u2202\u03c1\u2202[\u00b5\u03be\u03bd] . (4.5)\nThe goal is then to construct an action whose equations of motion are the flatness conditions\nQ\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 0 , and (tr J)\u00b5|\u03bd = 0 . (4.6)\nThe first of these conditions allows us to express \u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 in terms of h\u00b5\u03bd . Then, in terms of h\u00b5\u03bd , J(2|2) is nothing other than the linearized Riemann tensor, so that the equation tr J = 0 is precisely the linearized Einstein equation.\nAn action that produces (4.6) as its equations of motion is\nS = \u2212a \u222b ddx [ h\u00b5\u03bd ( \u2202\u03b1\u0393\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd \u2212 \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03b1\u0393 \u03b1\u03c1 |\u03c1 + \u2202\u03bd\u0393 \u03c1 \u00b5 |\u03c1 ) + 14\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u0393 \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 \u2212 12\u0393 \u00b5\u03c1 |\u03c1\u0393 \u03c3 \u00b5 |\u03c3 ] .\n(4.7) This action is precisely of the form (2.55), where the first term in brackets is the linearized Einstein tensor, written in terms of \u0393(2|1). Upon integrating out this auxiliary field, we recover the ordinary Einstein action for h\u00b5\u03bd . This action possesses a higher-biform symmetry, whose Noether current is J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 in (4.3). Coupling this current to a background gauge field source improves the current J to the gauge-invariant current J , which then displays the mixed anomaly (4.2) between ordinary and dual conservation. In this section we first describe the higher form symmetries of linearized gravity and their gauging, showing how the biform current J(2|2) arises from the linear Einstein action. We then invert the logic and demonstrate how one can use the higher-form currents and their anomalies as an input in order to interpret linearized gravity as a gapless phase realizing these symmetries in a particular way. This serves as a version of a Goldstone theorem for the graviton."

The Fierz-Pauli action is invariant under linearized diffeomorphisms, where h\u00b5\u03bd shifts as\n\u03b4h\u00b5\u03bd = \u2202\u00b5\u03be\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd\u03be\u00b5 . (4.11)\nThis diffeomorphism invariance is seen most simply in the form (4.10). The Einstein tensor (4.9) is both identically gauge invariant and conserved, so that the action is gauge invariant after integration by parts. The Einstein tensor is not the most general gauge-invariant local operator in linearized gravity. In fact, the full linearized Riemann tensor\nR\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03bdh\u00b5\u03c3 + \u2202\u03c3\u2202\u00b5h\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 \u2202\u03c3\u2202\u03bdh\u00b5\u03c1 \u2212 \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u00b5h\u03bd\u03c3 , (4.12)\nis gauge invariant, and has the symmetries of the GL(d) Young tableau\nR\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u2208 \u00b5 \u03c1 \u03bd \u03c3 . (4.13)\nThe Einstein tensor (4.9) is related to the traces of the Riemann tensor as G\u00b5\u03bd = R \u03b1\u03b1\u00b5 \u03bd \u2212 1 2\u03b7\u00b5\u03bdR \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b1\u03b2 , so the linearized Einstein equations are a partial flatness condition, setting the trace of the Riemann tensor to zero. The remaining nonzero curvature is the Weyl tensor.24 It is straightforward to check that the symmetries of the Riemann tensor along with the linearized Einstein equation are equivalent to the following conditions on the Riemann tensor25\nR\u00b5 \u03bd\u00b5\u03b2 = 0 , R[\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1]\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\u2202\u00b5R\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 , \u2202[\u03c1R\u00b5\u03bd]\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 . (4.14)\nAs we will see, the linearized Riemann tensor is closely related to the current J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 appearing in eqs. (4.2).\nSymmetries. In addition to linearized diffeomorphisms (4.11), the Fierz-Pauli action is also invariant under a global (1|1)-biform symmetry where\n\u03b4h\u00b5\u03bd = b\u00b5\u03bd , (4.15)\nwith b\u00b5\u03bd a constant symmetric tensor. The Noether current associated to this continuous symmetry is a (2|1)-form\nJ\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1 = \u2202[\u00b5h\u03bd]\u03b1 + \u03b7\u03b1[\u00b5\u2202\u03bd]h+ 1 2\u2202 \u03c1h\u03c1[\u00b5\u03b7\u03bd]\u03b1 .

This formulation is the one that makes electric-magnetic duality of gravity manifest in D = 4 [39, 53, 56].\n\u2013 38 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nThe divergence of this current is the linearized Einstein tensor: \u2202\u00b5J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1 = G\u03bd\u03b1, so it is conserved on-shell, as expected. However, this current is not gauge invariant, and so does not really exist as an operator in the theory. This suggests that the symmetry for which the graviton is a Goldstone is a slightly different, but related, one. The transformation (4.15) with a constant b\u00b5\u03bd is not the most general (1|1)-form symmetry of the Fierz-Pauli action. More generally, b\u00b5\u03bd can have some spatial dependence, we just need to require that the Riemann tensor built from it vanishes: R[b]\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 = 0, rather than b being constant.26 This condition is the analogue of the 1-form symmetry in electromagnetism requiring that we shift by a flat connection. The relevant choice is to write b\u00b5\u03bd as the divergence of a three-index tensor b\u00b5\u03bd = 2\u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1(\u00b5|\u03bd) so that h\u00b5\u03bd shifts as\n\u03b4h\u00b5\u03bd = 2\u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1(\u00b5|\u03bd) , (4.17)\nwhere \u039b\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd is a (2|1)-biform\n\u039b\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd \u2208 \u03b1 \u03bd\u00b5 . (4.18)\nThe benefit of parametrizing b\u00b5\u03bd this way is that the corresponding Noether current is the Riemann tensor (4.12), which is gauge invariant. In a precise sense, we can think of the graviton as the Goldstone mode for this nonlinearly realized higher-biform symmetry.27 We would like to study the gauging of these (1|1)-biform symmetries. Our desire is to source the Riemann tensor current, which is diffeomorphism invariant. But, once we promote b\u00b5\u03bd to be an arbitrary function, it is hard to tell the difference between (4.15) and (4.17). We are therefore motivated to find a formulation that decouples these two symmetries in order to simplify the gauging of the system. Precisely this happens in first-order form, as we now describe."

As we will now show, this is indeed the case.\nWe begin by splitting \u0393\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1 into its irreducible components as\n\u0393\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1 = \u2212 1 3 ( \u0393\u03b1\u03bd|\u00b5 + \u0393\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd ) + \u0393(s)\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1 , (4.25)\nwhere \u0393(s) is a symmetric tensor and \u0393\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd is a (2|1)-biform, with the index symmetries of the Young tableau\n\u0393\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd \u2208 \u03b1 \u03bd\u00b5 , (4.26)\nand the normalization has been chosen for later convenience. In terms of these fields, the action (4.19) becomes S= \u222b ddx [ \u03d5\u00b5\u03bd ( \u22122\u2202\u00b5\u0393(s) \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1 +2\u2202\u03b1\u0393(s) \u03b1\u00b5\u03bd ) \u2212 23\u03d5 \u00b5\u03bd ( \u2202(\u00b5\u0393\u03bd)\u22122\u2202\u03b1\u0393 \u03b1(\u00b5 |\u03bd) ) (4.27)\n+\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd (\n2\u0393(s) \u03b1\u03c1\u00b5 \u0393(s) \u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u22122\u0393(s) \u03b1\u00b5\u03b1 \u0393(s) \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1 \u2212 1 3\u0393\u00b5\u03b1|\u03c1\u0393 \u03b1|\u03c1 \u03bd + 4 9\u0393\u00b5\u0393\u03bd+ 2 3\u0393\u00b5\u0393 (s) \u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1\n)] ,\n\u2013 40 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nwhere we have defined \u0393\u00b5 \u2261 \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2\u0393\u00b5\u03b1|\u03b2 , the trace of \u0393(2|1). We can then integrate out \u0393 (s) \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1 using its equation of motion, which sets\n\u0393(s)\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1 = 1 2(d\u2212 1)\u03b7(\u00b5\u03bd\u0393\u03b1) + 1 2\u2202(\u00b5\u03d5\u03bd\u03b1) + 1 2(d\u2212 1)\u2202 \u03c1\u03d5\u03c1(\u03b1\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd) \u2212 1 2(d\u2212 1)\u03b7(\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03b1)\u03d5 . (4.28)\nSubstituting this back into the action (after defining \u03d5\u00b5\u03bd = h\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 12h\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd and integrating by parts), we get\nS= \u222b ddx ( 2\u22123d\n3(d\u22121)\n[ h\u00b5\u03bd ( \u2202\u03b1\u0393\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd\u2212\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03b1\u0393 \u03b1\u03c1 |\u03c1+\u2202\u03bd\u0393 \u03c1 \u00b5 |\u03c1 ) + 14\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u0393 \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u2212 12\u0393 \u00b5\u03c1 |\u03c1\u0393 \u03c3 \u00b5 |\u03c3 ] \u2212 16(d\u22121)h \u00b5\u03bdG[h]\u00b5\u03bd\u2212 (d\u22122) 12(d\u22121)(\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u22122\u2202[\u00b5h\u03bd]\u03b1)(\u0393 \u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u22122\u2202[\u00b5h\u03bd]\u03b1) ) .\n(4.29) The field \u0393(2|1) is still auxiliary, and integrating it out using its equation of motion sets\n\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1 = \u2202\u00b5h\u03bd\u03b1 \u2212 \u2202\u03bdh\u00b5\u03b1 . (4.30)\nSubstituting this into the action (4.29) reproduces the linearized Einstein-Hilbert action. The action (4.29) therefore is a formulation of linearized gravity with an auxiliary (2|1)-biform field. However, it is not exactly of the form that we would expect from (2.55). In particular we would like to remove the quadratic dependence on h\u00b5\u03bd . In reality, (4.29) is a representative of a two-parameter family of actions that all produce the same equations of motion, which are (4.30), along with the linearized Einstein equation G\u00b5\u03bd = 0. We are free to add any multiple of both h\u00b5\u03bdG\u00b5\u03bd and (\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1 \u2212 \u2202\u00b5h\u03bd\u03b1 + \u2202\u00b5h\u03bd\u03b1)2 to the action without modifying these equations of motion. There is a unique choice, up to overall rescaling, that removes the quadratic dependence on h\u00b5\u03bd so that we are left with\nS = \u2212a \u222b ddx [ h\u00b5\u03bd ( \u2202\u03b1\u0393\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd \u2212 \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03b1\u0393 \u03b1\u03c1 |\u03c1 + \u2202\u03bd\u0393 \u03c1 \u00b5 |\u03c1 ) + 14\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u0393 \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 \u2212 12\u0393 \u00b5\u03c1 |\u03c1\u0393 \u03c3 \u00b5 |\u03c3 ] .\n(4.31) This action is exactly equivalent to the linearized Einstein action, after integrating out \u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1 using (4.30), and where a parametrizes its overall scaling. Of course we could have just written down (4.31) without taking this detour through the linearized Palatini formulation (4.19), but it is conceptually useful to see how this fractonic formulation of linearized gravity arises from more familiar variables.\nIf we introduce the two curvatures\nJ\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03c3 \u2261 a 2 ( \u2202\u03c1\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c3 \u2212 \u2202\u03c3\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 ) , (4.32)\nQ\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 \u2261 \u2202\u00b5h\u03bd|\u03c1 \u2212 \u2202\u03bdh\u00b5|\u03c1 \u2212 \u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 , (4.33)\nthen the equations of motion of (4.31) are precisely the statements that (parts of) these curvatures vanish\n(tr J)\u00b5|\u03c1 = 0 , Q\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 0 . (4.34)\n\u2013 41 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nWe see that the curvature J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03c3 coincides with the linearized Riemann tensor on-shell using the vanishing of Q(2|1). Consequently we find that J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03c3 is also conserved and its antisymmetric derivative vanishes on shell. The action (4.31) has the same higher-form symmetries as the original linearized Einstein-Hilbert action (4.8), but this formulation is more convenient for their gauging."

In addition to the gauge transformations\n\u03b4h\u00b5|\u03bd = \u2202\u00b5\u03be\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd\u03be\u00b5 , \u03b4\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u00b5\u03be\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03bd\u03be\u00b5 , (4.35)\nthe action (4.31) is invariant under some biform symmetries. The first type is (4.15) where we just shift h\u00b5\u03bd : \u03b4h\u00b5\u03bd = b\u00b5\u03bd , \u03b4\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 0 , (4.36) with b\u00b5\u03bd a constant tensor. The action is additionally invariant under a symmetry of the form (4.17), where now \u0393(2|1) transforms as well\n\u03b4h\u00b5\u03bd = \u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd +\u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1\u03bd|\u00b5 , \u03b4\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1\u03bd|\u03c1+\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1\u03c1|\u03bd\u2212\u2202\u03bd\u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1\u00b5|\u03c1\u2212\u2202\u03bd\u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1\u03c1|\u00b5 . (4.37) We now see one of the benefits of the first-order formulation, it decouples the symmetry whose Noether current is the gauge non-invariant (4.16), from the symmetry whose current is the Riemann tensor.28 We now want to gauge the symmetry (4.37). That is, we want to promote (4.37) to a symmetry for an arbitrary function \u039b\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1, not just one for which the Einstein tensor built out of \u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd vanishes. There are two complementary viewpoints on this procedure: the first is to introduce couplings to a background gauge field into the action (4.31) so that it becomes invariant under these more general transformations. The other is to work at the level of the curvatures (4.32) and (4.33) and promote them to gauge-invariant operators. These are of course closely related and we will explore both. The background field that gauges the symmetry (4.37) should act as a source for J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 , so we introduce a gauge field A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 with the index symmetries of Riemann:\nA\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 \u2208 \u00b5 \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 .

We could imagine considering symmetries involving additional derivatives of tensors with more indices. Following a similar logic, we would find that their associated conserved currents are derivatives of the Riemann tensor. This is in a sense similar to the fractonic superfluids considered in section 3. It is natural to consider the symmetry (4.37) because gauging it will introduce a source for the simplest gauge-invariant operator in the theory.\n\u2013 42 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nwhere Y(2|2) is the projector onto the tableau (4.38), and where we have introduced the free parameter, g, which captures the relative normalization between the gauge transformations of the dynamical fields h\u00b5\u03bd ,\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 and the background field A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2. The slightly strange parameterization is chosen for later convenience. At this point, we can just directly construct combinations of A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 that promote (4.33) to a gauge-invariant current (note that Q(2|1) is already gauge invariant). It is mechanically simpler, however, to first construct a gauge invariant action and then derive the gaugeimproved current J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 from it. There is a two-parameter family of actions invariant under the gauge symmetry, which can be parameterized as\nS= \u222b ddx [ \u2212h\u00b5\u03bd ( \u2202\u03b1\u0393\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd\u2212\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03b1\u0393 \u03b1\u03c1 |\u03c1+\u2202\u03bd\u0393 \u03c1 \u00b5 |\u03c1+\u2202 \u03b1\u2202\u03b2A\u00b5\u03b1|\u03bd\u03b2 ) \u2212 14\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u0393 \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1+ 12\u0393 \u00b5\u03c1 |\u03c1\u0393 \u03c3 \u00b5 |\u03c3\n+gA\u00b5|\u03bdR\u00b5\u03bd\u2212 1 4(1+2g)AR+\u03ba(\u2202\u03b1A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03c3) 2\u22124\u03ba(\u2202\u03b1A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03b1)2+c1(\u2202\u03b1A\u00b5|\u03bd)2\n\u22122c1(\u2202\u03b1A\u03b1|\u03bd)2+c2A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03b1A\u03bd|\u03b2+c3(\u2202A)2+c4A\u00b5|\u03bd\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdA ] , (4.42)\nwhere the coefficients c1, c2, c3, c4 can be written in terms of the free parameters g, \u03ba as:\nc1 \u2261 1 2 ( g2 \u2212 8\u03ba\u2212 1 ) , c2 \u2261 \u2212g \u2212 8\u03ba\u2212 1 , (4.43) c3 \u2261 \u2212 1 2g(g + 1) + \u03ba , c4 \u2261 \u2212 1 2 ( g(2g + 1)\u2212 8\u03ba\u2212 1 ) . (4.44)\nIn writing the action (4.42) it was convenient to introduce both the trace of A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 , defined as A\u00b5|\u03bd \u2261 A \u03b1\u00b5 |\u03bd\u03b1, and the double trace A \u2261 \u03b7\n\u00b5\u03bdA\u00b5|\u03bd . Using the action (4.42) we can extract gauge-invariant versions of the Einstein tensor\nand the current J(2|2) as\nG\u00b5\u03bd \u2261 \u03b4S\n\u03b4h\u00b5\u03bd , (4.45)\nJ\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u03b4S\n\u03b4A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 . (4.46)\nNote that the \u0393(2|1) equation of motion is unchanged in the presence of A(2|2) and still sets \u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1 = \u2202\u00b5h\u03bd\u03b1 \u2212 \u2202\u03bdh\u00b5\u03b1. Explicitly, the gauge-invariant improvement of the Einstein tensor is given by\nG\u00b5\u03bd = G[\u0393]\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2A\u00b5\u03b1|\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212 g ( A\u00b5|\u03bd \u2212 2\u2202\u03b1\u2202(\u00b5A\u03bd)|\u03b1 + \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2A\u03b1|\u03b2 ) \u2212 12 (1 + 2g) ( \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdA\u2212 \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd A ) ,\n(4.47)\nwhere G[\u0393]\u00b5\u03bd is the ordinary Einstein tensor written in terms of \u0393,\nG[\u0393]\u00b5\u03bd \u2261 \u2212\u2202\u03b1\u0393\u03b1(\u00b5|\u03bd) + \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03b1\u0393 \u03b1\u03c1 |\u03c1 \u2212 \u2202(\u00b5\u0393 \u03c1 \u03bd) |\u03c1 .

It is relatively straightforward to check that both (4.47) and (4.49) are invariant under the gauge transformations (4.39)\u2013 (4.41). Note that as a consequence of the index symmetries of A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 , the current satisfies the condition J[\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1]\u03b2 = 0 , even off-shell. In the next section we will explore the on-shell properties of this current. Though we have been proceeding in first-order form, there is an elegant simplification of the action (4.42) that occurs in second-order form. If we use the equation (4.30) to integrate out \u0393(2|1), we can write the action as\nS = 12\n\u222b ddx ( h\u00b5\u03bdG\u00b5\u03bd +A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03c3J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03c3 ) . (4.51)\nVarying this action with respect to h\u00b5\u03bd produces (4.47) (with \u0393(2|1) written in terms of h\u00b5\u03bd), and varying with respect to A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03c3 produces (4.49). Note that the existence of this formulation of the action is entirely nontrivial because both terms contribute to each variation, so there must be a conspiracy between the two terms to produce the correct variations."

Recall that this current satisfies all of the equations\nJ\u00b5\u03bd|\u00b5\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\u2202\u00b5J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 , \u2202[\u03c1J\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 , (4.52)\non shell. We have coupled the theory to A(2|2) in a way that preserves the gauge transformation (4.39), so J(2|2) will be conserved on-shell. However, the other two conditions in (4.52) are not necessarily satisfied because A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 is not traceless, and does not have the correct gauge symmetry to guarantee dual conservation. So, we want to see how we can use the freedom to select the parameters \u03ba and g in (4.42) to enforce as many of the conditions (4.52) as possible for J(2|2) on shell. We will find two interesting features: the first is that not all the conservation conditions (4.52) can be satisfied \u2014 which implies a nontrivial mixed \u2019t Hooft anomaly. Additionally, we will find that the d = 4 dimensional case is special, where we can impose even fewer conditions.\n\u2013 44 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nConservation conditions on-shell. In order to explore the anomaly structure, we need to compute the on-shell conditions (4.52) for J(2|2). This means that we can use the conditions G\u00b5\u03bd = 0, where G is defined in (4.47) and Q = 0, where Q is defined in (4.33). We can then compute\n\u2022 Trace: we first compute the trace J\u00b5|\u03bd = \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2J\u00b5\u03b1|\u03bd\u03b2 :\nJ\u00b5|\u03bd = ( 3\u2212 d\u2212 8(d\u2212 4)\u03ba ) 4 [ \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3A\u00b5\u03c1|\u03bd\u03c3 \u2212 A\u00b5|\u03bd + 2\u2202\u03b1\u2202(\u00b5A\u03bd)|\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3A\u03c1|\u03c3\n\u2212 12 ( \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdA\u2212 \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd A )] ,\n(4.53) which we see in general does not necessarily vanish. We can also check that the right hand side is gauge invariant, as it must be.\n\u2022 Conservation: next we can compute the divergence, which vanishes on shell\n\u2202\u00b5J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 . (4.54)\nThis is a consequence of the way that we have introduced the gauge field A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2. Since its gauge transformation involves a derivative of the gauge parameter, gauge invariance guarantees that it couples to an on-shell conserved current. If we had chosen to gauge the theory in a different way this condition would not necessarily be satisfied.\n\u2022 Dual conservation: finally, we can compute the antisymmetric derivative\n\u2202[\u03c1J\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u2202[\u03c1C\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 , (4.55)\nwhere we have defined the tensor\nC\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u2212Y(2|2) [ 2\u03ba ( 4\u2202\u03c1\u2202\u00b5A\u03bd\u03b1|\u03b2\u03c1 \u2212 A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 ) \u2212 3(1 + 8\u03ba)4 \u03b7\u00b5\u03b1 ( \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3A\u03c1\u03bd|\u03c3\u03b2 + 2\u2202\u03bd\u2202\u03c1A\u03b2|\u03c1 \u2212 A\u03bd|\u03b2\n) + 38 ( 8\u03ba+ 1 + 1 d\u2212 2 ) \u03b7\u00b5\u03b1\u03b7\u03bd\u03b2 ( \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3A\u03c1|\u03c3 \u2212 1 2 A )] .\n(4.56)\nIt is easy to check that the field strength \u2202[\u03c1C\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 is gauge invariant, as expected.\nNow that we have the three on-shell equations (4.53), (4.54), and (4.55) we want to see how many of them we can set to zero simultaneously. It is clear from (4.53) and (4.55) that it is not possible to make them all vanish. In particular, we cannot make (4.55) vanish for any choice of parameters, because we have required (4.54) to be satisfied, which is the expression of a mixed anomaly between the electric and magnetic biform symmetries. However, we see from (4.53) that we can set the trace to zero in d 6= 4, so it is convenient to split the discussion into two cases, d > 4 and d = 4. We will consider the generic case first.\n\u2013 45 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nGeneric dimension d > 4. In the general case it is possible to make J(2|2) both traceless and conserved, in addition to being dual traceless. We accomplish this by setting\n\u03ba = \u2212 (d\u2212 3)8(d\u2212 4) . (4.57)\nIn addition, it is convenient to further set g = 1/(2\u2212 d). With this choice, we can partially fix the gauge invariance to set A = 0, after which the trace A\u00b5|\u03bd completely decouples and the action (4.42) becomes\nS= \u222b ddx [ \u2212h\u00b5\u03bd ( \u2202\u03b1\u0393\u03b1\u00b5|\u03bd\u2212\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03b1\u0393 \u03b1\u03c1 |\u03c1+\u2202\u03bd\u0393 \u03c1 \u00b5 |\u03c1+\u2202 \u03b1\u2202\u03b2A (T ) \u00b5\u03b1|\u03bd\u03b2 ) \u2212 14\u0393\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u0393 \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1+ 12\u0393 \u00b5\u03c1 |\u03c1\u0393 \u03c1 \u00b5 |\u03c1\n\u2212 (d\u22123)8(d\u22124) ( \u2202\u03b1A (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03c3 )2 + (d\u22123)2(d\u22124) ( \u2202\u03b1A (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u03b1 )2 ] ,\n(4.58) where we have introduced the traceless part of A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 defined as\nA (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 3 d\u2212 2Y(2|2)A\u00b5|\u03b1\u03b7\u03bd\u03b2 , (4.59)\nand where A\u00b5|\u03bd itself is traceless because of the partial gauge fixing we have done. The action (4.58) is invariant under the gauge transformations (4.39)\u2013(4.41) with a traceless gauge parameter. The fact that only the traceless part of A(2|2) couples to the dynamical fields will imply that the corresponding current J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 is now traceless off shell. We can write the relevant current more explicitly as\nJ\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 = 1 4W\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 C (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 , (4.60)\nwhere the C tensor built from the traceless part of A is:\nC (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 = d\u2212 3 d\u2212 4Y(2|2)\n( \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u00b5A (T ) \u03bd\u03b1|\u03b2\u03c1 \u2212 1 4 A (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 3 2(d\u2212 2)\u03b7\u00b5\u03b1\u2202 \u03c1\u2202\u03c3A (T ) \u03c1\u03bd|\u03c3\u03b2 ) . (4.61)\nNote that it is not obvious in the way (4.61) is written, but C(T )\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 is traceless as it should. In fact, (4.61) is the unique tensor that is traceless, has the correct index symmetries, and transforms oppositely to the Weyl tensor, so that the current (4.60) is gauge invariant. Indeed, we could have worked directly at the level of the current and introduced (4.61) in order to gauge the relevant symmetries, and we would have ended up with the same result. The current (4.60) has many desired properties; however the right hand side of (4.55) continues to be nonzero, so that all together we have\nJ \u00b5\u03bd|\u00b5\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\u2202\u00b5J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 , \u2202[\u03c1J\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u2202[\u03c1C (d) \u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n(4.62)\nwhere the tensor appearing in the magnetic conservation equation is\nC(d)\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 = d\u2212 3 d\u2212 4Y(2|2)\n( \u2202\u03c3\u2202\u03b2A (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03c3 \u2212 1 4 A (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 3 4(d\u2212 3)\u03b7\u00b5\u03b1\u2202 \u03c1\u2202\u03c3A (T ) \u03c1\u03bd|\u03c3\u03b2 ) . (4.63)\n\u2013 46 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nNote that this differs slightly from (4.61) because there are contributions from the equations of motion to the right hand side of the dual conservation equation. Our inability to satisfy both the electric and magnetic conservation laws at the same time is a consequence of a mixed \u2019t Hooft anomaly between these global biform symmetries. We could, of course, have instead chosen J(2|2) to be dual conserved (preserving the magnetic symmetry), but we would then have found both electric conservation and tracelessness would fail to hold. We can understand the presence of the graviton as being a consequence of this mixed anomaly, as we explore in section 4.4.\nFour dimensions. As we can see from the appearance of (d \u2212 4) factors in (4.57) and (4.61), something is special about d = 4. Indeed, we can no longer choose parameters to make J(2|2) both traceless and conserved.29 In particular, setting \u03ba as in (4.57) is not possible, because it will diverge in d = 4. In this case, the conservation equations take the form\nJ \u00b5\u03bd|\u00b5\u03b2 = C (4) \u00b5|\u03bd ,\n\u2202\u00b5J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 , \u2202[\u03c1J\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u2202[\u03c1C (4) \u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n(4.64)\nwhere the field strengths appearing on the right hand sides are\nC(4)\u00b5|\u03bd = \u2212 1 4\n[ \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3A\u00b5\u03c1|\u03bd\u03c3 \u2212 A\u00b5|\u03bd + 2\u2202\u03b1\u2202(\u00b5A\u03bd)|\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3A\u03c1|\u03c3 \u2212\n1 2\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdA+ 1 2\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd A\n] ,\n(4.65) along with C(4)\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 =Y(2|2) [ 2\u03ba ( A\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2\u22124\u2202\u03c1\u2202\u00b5A\u03bd\u03b1|\u03b2\u03c1 ) + (3 4 +6\u03ba ) \u03b7\u00b5\u03b1 ( \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3A\u03c1\u03bd|\u03c3\u03b2+2\u2202\u03bd\u2202\u03c1A\u03b2|\u03c1\u2212 A\u03bd|\u03b2\n) \u2212 316 (3+16\u03ba)\u03b7\u00b5\u03b1\u03b7\u03bd\u03b2 ( \u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3A\u03c1|\u03c3\u2212 1 2 A )] ,\n(4.66) where A is the trace of A\u00b5|\u03bd .\nIt is easy to check that C(4)(1|1) and dC (4) (2|2) are gauge invariant under the transforma-\ntion (4.39). Interestingly, we see that the minimal anomaly in d = 4 also involves failure of tracelessness, in contrast to the d > 4 case. Here we have given only one presentation of the mixed anomaly between the various conservation conditions (4.52). By including different contact terms (corresponding to terms quadratic in the gauge field) or gauging the theory in different variables one can shuffle around the anomaly into failures of different conservations conditions. However, the incompatibility between electric and magnetic conservation cannot be changed. Indeed, one can understand gravity as a gapless phase mandated by the presence of this anomaly. In the following section, we explore this viewpoint, and show how the anomalies uncovered here can be used to prove that there is a massless spin-2 field in the spectrum of the theory, without making any reference to an underlying Lagrangian that realizes the physics. This approach also has the benefit of making manifest the origin of the anomaly and showing that it cannot be removed by clever choice of field variables or gauging of the theory.\n29As in the galileon superfluid case, the tensor (4.61) (after multiplying through by d\u22124) is gauge invariant in d = 4, which prevents us from using it to gauge J(2|2).\n\u2013 47 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1"

To do so, we will prove a version of a Goldstone theorem, showing that any theory that has two currents of the type (4.1) with a mixed anomaly necessarily has a gapless spin-2 mode in the spectrum. In the deep infrared, this graviton is of course described by the linearized Einstein action discussed in section 4.1. The philosophy is then that we can define a (linear) theory of gravity as the gapless phase with a particular structure of conserved currents associated to biform global symmetries.\nConcretely, we consider a theory that has two currents of the form (4.1)\nJ\u00b51\u00b52|\u03bd1\u03bd2 , and K\u00b51\u00b52\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5d\u22122|\u03bd1\u03bd2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdd\u22122 .

We can then construct the most general ansatz for the Fourier-space correlator \u3008J\u00b51\u00b52|\u03bd1\u03bd2 \u2217K\u2217\u03b11\u03b12|\u03b21\u03b22\u3009, where the two currents have the following index symmetries\nJ\u00b51\u00b52|\u03bd1\u03bd2 \u2208 \u00b51 \u03bd1 \u00b52 \u03bd2 , \u2217K\u2217\u03b11\u03b12|\u03b21\u03b22 \u2208 \u03b11 \u03b21 \u03b12 \u03b22 , (4.69)\nwhich is built solely out of the Lorentz-invariant metric \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd , and the single momentum that the correlator depends on, p\u00b5.

Instead, the anomaly equation for K (which is the gaugeimprovement of K in a background field that sources J)30\np[\u03bb\u2217K\u2217 \u03b1\u03b2 \u00b5\u03bd]| = \u2212 d\u2212 3 d\u2212 4p[\u03bbY(2|2)\n( p\u03c1p\u03b2A\n(T )\u03b1 \u00b5\u03bd]| \u03c1 \u2212 1 4p 2A (T )\u03b1\u03b2 \u00b5\u03bd]| \u2212 3 4(d\u2212 3)\u03b4 \u03b1 \u00b5 p \u03c1p\u03c3A (T ) \u03b2 \u03bd]\u03c1| \u03c3\n) ,\n(4.74) expresses the fact that the non-conservation of K only fails at coincident points. Taking a functional derivative of (4.74) with respect to A(T )\u03b11\u03b12|\u03b21\u03b22 yields an explicit expression for the terms analytic in p that appear in the non-conservation of K. Applying this to (4.71) sets f(p2) = \u2212 1(d\u22122)(d\u22124) , and so the current-current two-point function is completely fixed:\n\u3008J\u00b51\u00b52|\u03bd1\u03bd2 \u2217K\u2217\u03b11\u03b12|\u03b21\u03b22\u3009 = d\u2212 3\n4(d\u2212 2)\n[ p2\u03a0(1|1)\u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd2\u03b11\u03b12\u03b21\u03b22 + contact terms ] . (4.75)\nLooking at the definition (4.72), we see that (4.75) scales like p\u22122, so we can already anticipate that there will be a massless particle in the spectrum of the theory, and indeed we will see that this is the two-point function of a massless spin-2 particle. The conditions (4.70) are the maximal set that we can impose identically, shuffling the anomaly into the failure of conservation of the magnetic current at coincident points.\n30This equation can be obtained from (4.62), but it can alternatively be thought of as a definition of the theory because K is uniquely determined in the presence of a traceless source for J , as was discussed below equation (4.61).\n\u2013 49 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nHowever, it is possible to require other conditions to be satisfied identically, making the anomaly appear elsewhere. All this does is change the precise contact terms that appear in (4.75), but does not alter the nonlocal part of the correlator. Since only the nonlocal part is relevant to extract the spectrum of the theory, there is no loss of generality in making the choices of conservation conditions to impose that we have made. Nevertheless, for completeness in appendix D, we discuss the other possible conditions that one could impose.\nFour dimensions. In four dimensions there are several subtle differences compared with the general dimensional case. First, we have to take into account dimension-dependent identities, which cause some linear combinations of the general tensor structures in the current two-point function ansatz to vanish. This removes one free parameter, leading to an ansatz with 10 independent structures. In four dimensions, it is not possible to require all of (4.70) at coincident points, consistent with what we saw in section 4.3. Instead, the maximal condition we can impose everywhere is\n\u2202\u00b51J\u00b51\u00b52|\u03bd1\u03bd2 = 0 . (4.76)\nThis, completely fixes the correlator, up to overall normalization, which can be fixed by the anomaly equations\nJ \u00b5\u03bd|\u00b5\u03b2 = C (4) \u00b5|\u03bd , \u2202[\u03c1 \u2217K\u2217\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u2202[\u03c1C (4) \u00b5\u03bd]|\u03b1\u03b2 , (4.77)\nwhere the field strengths C(4)\u00b5|\u03bd and dC (4) (2|2) are given by (4.65) and (4.66), respectively. Accounting for all these constraints, the current two-point function is again completely fixed to be (4.75) with d = 4. Note that the contact terms are different between the d = 4 case and the d > 4 case. In particular, in four dimensions, we need traceful contact terms to be able to write the full two-point function. The d = 4 case is written explicitly in equation (D.19) in appendix D.2.1. As before, we see that this correlator has a 1/p2 pole, indicating the presence of a massless spin-2 field in the spectrum."

The universal effective action for this gapless phase is then the linearized Einstein action (plus irrelevant corrections), whose properties we explored in sections 4.1\u20134.3. The strategy is as before: we decompose the current two-point function (4.75) by means of the K\u00e4ll\u00e9n-Lehmann spectral representation. We can then read off the (gapless) spectrum of the theory by matching the spectral density to the correlator, which is entirely fixed by the structure of symmetries and anomalies.

The spectral densities \u03c1(i|j) are associated with the internal propagation of states with (i|j)-biform Lorentz representations. Since a massless (2|2) or (2|1) state cannot couple to a current of Riemann type [67, 68], the densities \u03c1(2|2), \u03c1(2|1) must go to zero as s\u2192 0.

Since the spectral decomposition is insensitive to contact terms, the presence of the graviton is completely robust, and does not depend on where we choose to put the anomaly. This establishes a Goldstone-like theorem: any theory with conserved currents of the form (4.69) with a mixed anomaly will be in a gapless phase where the massless degree of freedom has spin two.31"

(4.86)\nThere is an independent charge for each choice of the constant c tensors. For d = 4, there are a total of 20 such charges. These are the same charges discussed recently in non-relativistic language in [17] and covariantly in [33]. Earlier references include [86\u201390]. As we pointed out before, we expect only c\u00b5 and c\u00b5\u03bd to yield non-trivial charges for topologically trivial field configurations that are regular on \u03a3d\u22122. Still, we will consider solutions that turn on all charges and we will comment on their regularity and significance. Let us then describe solutions of the equations of motion of linearized gravity that carry these charges. In electromagnetism the Coulomb and Dirac monopole solutions carry respectively the 1-form electric and magnetic charges. Analogous solutions exist in this case, carrying (4.86). In d = 4 we will see explicitly these include their magnetic counterparts. These will be solutions which are singular at the spatial origin, and can be considered as defect line operators that are charged under the 1-form symmetries corresponding to the topological operators (4.86). Furthermore, there might be Dirac strings coming out of these singularities for topologically non-trivial solutions. The Lorentzian d = 4 solutions are given in spherical coordinates by\nhtt = M r +Lcos(\u03b8)\n( r2+t2 ) 2r2 , hrr = M r \u2212Lcos(\u03b8) ( cos(2\u03b8) ( t2\u2212r2 ) +2t2 ) 2r2 , (4.87a)\nhtr =\u2212 Ltsin2(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8)\nr , hr\u03b8 =\u2212\nLsin(\u03b8) ( cos(2\u03b8) ( 3r2+t2 ) \u2212r2\u22123t2 ) 4r , (4.87b)\nht\u03b8 =\u2212Ltsin(\u03b8)cos2(\u03b8) , h\u03b8\u03b8 =Lsin(\u03b8)sin(2\u03b8) ( r2+t2 ) , (4.87c)\nht\u03c6 =\u2212N (c+cos\u03b8)+ J r sin2 \u03b8 , h\u03c6\u03c6 =Lr2 sin2(\u03b8)(b\u22122cos(\u03b8)) , (4.87d)\nwith the other components zero.33 33This solution with c = \u22121 and J = L = b = 0 was presented in [56].\n\u2013 52 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nThis general solution depends on six parameters: M , J , N , L, c and b. It solves the vacuum linearized Einstein equations for any choice of these parameters. The interpretation of the parameters appearing in the solution is as follows: M is a mass, the solution for this parameter is the linearized Schwarzschild solution [91]. The parameter J is an angular momentum along the z direction, the solution for this parameter is the linearized Kerr solution [92].34 The parameter N is a NUT charge, which is the magnetic dual of the mass, and the solution for this parameter is the linearized Taub-NUT solution [93, 94]. The parameter L is a magnetic dual version of angular momentum called acceleration, and the solution associated to this parameter is a linearization of the GR solution known as the C-metric [95\u2013100]. Finally, c, b are proportional to pure gauge solutions and will be important in our discussion of singularities. The solutions for M and J are manifestly regular away from the spatial origin. The solutions with N and L have Dirac string type singularities away from the origin along the z axis. Nevertheless, the Weyl tensor calculated from these solutions is regular away from the origin, showing that these singularities are gauge artifacts. This is analogous to electromagnetism, were the electric solution can be described with a single gauge field, but the magnetic solution requires patching together gauge fields with the singularities in various places, related on overlaps by a gauge transformation. Here, solutions with different singularity placements than those shown in (4.87) will be related by linearized diffeomorphisms. For instance, consider the N part of the solution,\nht\u03c6 = \u2212N (c+ cos \u03b8) , (4.88)\nwith other components zero. Here the c part is pure gauge, and this solution has the same Weyl tensor independent of the value of c. In cartesian coordinates, the non-zero metric components of the solution (4.88) are ht,x\u22a5 = x\u0302 \u22a5\n\u03c1\n( c+ z\u221a\nz2+\u03c12\n) , where x\u22a5 are the\ncoordinates perpendicular to z, and \u03c1 the distance from the z axis. Expanding for small \u03c1 we see that there is a singularity \u223c 1/\u03c1 extending along the positive z axis unless c = \u22121, and along the negative z axis unless c = 1. Given that the Weyl tensor is independent of c, these solutions must be related by a gauge transformation on the overlap where they are both non-singular,\nhc=1\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 hc=\u22121\u00b5\u03bd = \u2207\u00b5\u03be\u03bd +\u2207\u03bd\u03be\u00b5, with \u03be\u00b5 = (\u22122\u03c6, 0, 0, 0). (4.89)\nIn the above equation, the covariant derivative of the background flat metric in spherical coordinates has been used. A similar situation occurs for the L solution. We can see the structure of the singularity at the origin by expanding near the z axis in cartesian coordinates, where the upper sign applies for z > 0 and the lower sign applies for z < 0,\nh\u00b5\u03bd \u03c1\u21920\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192  \u00b1 t2+z22z2 0 0 0 0 (b\u22132)y 2 \u03c12 \u2212 (b\u22132)xy \u03c12 0 0 \u2212 (b\u22132)xy \u03c12 (b\u22132)x2 \u03c12 0\n0 0 0 \u00b112 ( 1\u2212 3t2 z2 )  , (4.90) 34Note that in the linearized theory there is no extremality or positive energy constraint and we can take\nany values for M , J .\n\u2013 53 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nwhere \u03c1 is the distance to the z axis. Note that there is no 1/\u03c1 type singularity as there was for the Taub-NUT solution, everything is finite at the z axis, but for generic b the metric depends on the direction of approach to the z axis, so there is still a discontinuity. We can remove this discontinuity for z > 0 by choosing b = 2, or we can remove this discontinuity for z < 0 by choosing b = \u22122. Given that the Weyl tensor is independent of b, these solutions must be related by a gauge transformation on the overlap where they are both non-singular. In spherical coordinates we have hb=2\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 hb=\u22122\u00b5\u03bd = diag(0, 0, 0, 4r2 sin2 \u03b8) which is pure gauge with the gauge parameter\nhb=2\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 hb=\u22122\u00b5\u03bd = \u2207\u00b5\u03be\u03bd +\u2207\u03bd\u03be\u00b5, with \u03be\u00b5 = (0, 0, 0, 2\u03c6). (4.91)\nLet us now comment on the meaning of equations (4.89) and (4.91). As can easily be seen, these gauge transformations are not globally well defined. This is completely analogous to the situation in electromagnetism for the Dirac monopole. In that case, the solution is only considered acceptable when the associated higher form symmetry is compact. When that happens, only the imaginary exponential of the gauge parameter is observable and the gauge transformation is allowed to have a discrete winding number. The same considerations apply here. If the biform symmetries associated with c\u00b5\u03bd and c\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1 are compact, we expect the gauge transformations (4.89) and (4.91) to be allowed. Otherwise, we must conclude that these charges are trivial. Notice that, in the compact case when these charges are allowed, they will furthermore introduce quantization conditions both for these charges and for their magnetic duals, as expected from Dirac quantization. We now evaluate the charges (4.86) for the metric (4.87). This can be done on any surface surrounding the worldline of the spatial origin, due to the topological nature of the charge. We will choose a spherical surface of radius R at time T surrounding the origin:\nQ(\u03b6)(\u03a32) = \u222b\n\u03a32 \u2217J (\u03b6) = \u222b d\u03b8d\u03c6 12 \u00b51\u00b52 \u03b8\u03c6 W\u00b51\u00b52 \u03bd1\u03bd2\u03b6 \u03bd1\u03bd2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=R,t=T , (4.92)\nand the fact that the result is independent of R and T is a check on the topological invariance of the charge. In d = 4, the tensors c\u00b51\u00b52 and c\u00b51\u00b52 each have 6 parameters, and c\u00b5 and c\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1 each have 4 parameters, for a total of 20 parameters. Evaluating (4.92) with all these parameters turned on we get (switching to cartesian coordinates)\nQ(\u03b6)(\u03a32) = 16\u03c0 ( c0M \u2212 c12 J + c123N \u2212 c03L ) . (4.93)\nSince the dual of the Weyl tensor is also conserved and traceless (or equivalently, the Weyl tensor is dual conserved), we can also consider the dual charges,\nQ\u0303(\u03b6)(\u03a32) = \u222b\n\u03a32 J (\u03b6). (4.94)\nEvaluating these explicitly, we find a different packaging of the same charges:\nQ\u0303(\u03b6)(\u03a32) = \u222b d\u03b8d\u03c6 W\u03b8\u03c6\u00b51\u00b52\u03b6\u00b51\u00b52 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=R,t=T = 16\u03c0 ( c123M \u2212 c03 J \u2212 c0N \u2212 c12L ) , (4.95)\n\u2013 54 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nconsistent with the electric-magnetic duality invariance of linear gravity in d = 4 [39, 53]. Notice that this is only the case in d = 4 at leading order in the EFT expansion. Higher derivative terms are expected to change the above result. In particular, we do not expect the magnetic dual current to be traceless, which changes the construction of charges above. The same comment applies to gravity in d > 4. We see from (4.93) that the conformal Killing tensor parameters c\u00b5 extract the standard energy-momentum, while c\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1 \u2014 dual to a vector in d = 4 \u2014 picks up the dual energy momentum (in general d, the dual energy-momentum is a 3-form [56]). The 2-form parameters c\u00b5\u03bd , c\u00b5\u03bd pick up the angular momentum and dual angular momentum. Note that these charges are constructed as integrals of gauge-invariant currents. This is unlike the standard Abbott-Deser charges [101], which are constructed as gauge-invariant integrals of non-gauge-invariant integrands. Furthermore, the integrals above can be computed on any surface that surrounds the defect and not only in asymptotic regions, as is typically done in the ADM formalism. In quantum field theory, the energy-momentum and angular momentum usually arise from 0-form symmetries, whose 1-form currents are given by contracting the stress tensor with a Killing vector. Linearized gravity, however, has no stress tensor [102, 103] (a direct consequence of the Weinberg-Witten theorem [66]) and we see here that energy-momentum and angular momentum instead arise from 1-form symmetries with 2-form currents."

            "text": "In this work we have taken a modest first step toward answering a deep and important question: what is gravity? It is quite surprising that more than three hundred years after Newton\u2019s \u2014 and more than one hundred after Einstein\u2019s \u2014 ideas started this research field, we do not have a precise and simple definition. Much of the effort in the last fifty years has revolved around the study of the ultraviolet properties of theories of gravity. The non-renormalizability of Einstein gravity catalyzed the search for a consistent theory of nature incorporating both gravity and quantum mechanics to arbitrarily high energy. While string theory provides an answer to this search, away from perturbation theory it does not really answer the posed question. What property or structure in string theory fundamentally makes it a theory of gravity? The issue becomes more acute in the context of the Swampland program. Since the space of actual solutions to string theory might correspond to isolated points in its landscape, we are left with a lack of adjustable parameters. From the ultraviolet perspective this is a great advantage, as it helps singling out a unique theory. From the infrared however, it points to a strange coincidence that the theory gives rise to a gapless phase we associate with Einstein gravity. What then, is the organizing principle? In condensed matter systems we have learned a great deal from the Landau paradigm, which states that phases of matter and phase transitions are associated to physical symmetries and the emergence of order parameters associated to them. This organizing principle for infrared physics has proved useful even at strong coupling, where perturbative techniques are unavailable. How does gravity fit into this paradigm? An important challenge is that we do not expect any exactly conserved\n\u2013 55 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nglobal charges in quantum gravity. While this presents a real difficulty in synthesizing gravity into this framework, it is not necessarily fatal. In the last few years, the concept of symmetry has been greatly enlarged to include more exotic concepts (e.g., higher-form, 2- group, non-invertible symmetries, and beyond). There may still be a structure, compatible with the constraints of quantum gravity, that defines this theory in terms of relations between observables. In this note we have approached the problem from the infrared by considering EFTs with a novel symmetry, biform symmetry. We have explored how theories with these symmetries can give rise to a gapless phase that is protected by a mixed anomaly between electric and magnetic biform currents. This structure of symmetries and anomalies is sufficient to completely fix the non-local part of the two-point correlators of the conserved currents in the theory. For theories with a maximal electric (1|1)-biform symmetry, the spectral decomposition of this correlator reveals the presence of a massless spin-2 excitation: the graviton. Using these global symmetries as a guiding principle, we can construct the universal EFT that reproduces this anomaly structure, which ends up being nothing but linearized gravity plus its (linear gauge invariant) irrelevant corrections. A similar story should go through for the higher biforms: for theories with a maximal electric (p|p)-biform symmetry, the spectral decomposition of the correlator determined from the anomaly should reveal the presence of a massless particle with the Lorentz symmetries of a (p\u22121|p\u22121)-biform. Note that this does not include the traditional higher-spin particles, which transform in completely symmetric Lorentz representations. (A further generalization to multiforms would be needed to account for these and other representations [54, 55].) Importantly, the EFTs so constructed are not restricted to free theories; they can include an infinite number of interaction terms. For example, corrections to the linearized Einstein action of the form W 3 \u2014 where W is the linearized Weyl tensor \u2014 are included in this EFT, and provide a cubic interaction for the graviton. So, these theories are far from trivial. Nevertheless, they do not include the usual graviton vertices we would obtain by expanding the fully nonlinear Einstein action, as these terms break the biform symmetries. However, we can get some guidance from the traditional gauge theory viewpoint. Starting from the linearized Einstein action, there are two paths that one can take [28]: the first is to include interactions that are exactly invariant under the linearized gauge transformations of the free theory [32], this reproduces the EFTs discussed here that have exact nonlinearly realized biform symmetries. Alternatively, we can introduce the Einstein-like irrelevant interactions that are not linearized gauge invariant. These interactions do not destroy the gauge invariance of the system, but rather deform it into full diffeomorphism invariance. This strongly suggests that there is a deformation of the biform symmetries that survive in the nonlinear Einstein theory, but it remains an important open challenge to understand precisely how this works, and to frame this physics from the perspective of global symmetries. Some further evidence that this is not a futile endeavor is provided by the fact that the charged solutions presented in section 4.5 persist in nonlinear Einstein gravity [104]. An interesting ingredient in all of these field theories is the presence of an anomaly. This anomaly is encoded by the Einstein term, which is the most relevant one in the EFT expansion. Interestingly, some of the physics associated to this term is quite similar to\n\u2013 56 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nthat of Chern-Simons (or BF) theories. This explains why the Einstein action produces equations of motion that set parts of curvatures to zero, instead of just implying their conservation, like what happens for Maxwell actions. A crucial difference with topological field theories, is, of course, that the associated biform symmetry allows for a gapless phase in our case \u2014 essentially because the equations of motion are only a partial flatness condition. Nevertheless, many of the lessons of the physics of anomalies in Chern-Simons theories can be imported into in these new cases. In this context, the presence of boundaries typically play an important role. The anomaly structure we have discussed can be reproduced from a higher-dimensional topological theory via inflow, which raises interesting questions: can we realize the linearized graviton as a boundary mode for a dynamical gapped bulk theory? Or, can we construct an Einstein-type action on boundaries of theories which have only Maxwell-type terms?.35\nAn important detail in the study of anomalies and their connection to different phases for these systems is whether the biform symmetry of interest is compact or non-compact. We have been a bit cavalier about this important aspect of the problem. It is the compactness of the symmetry that might lead to the quantization of anomalies and might prove crucial in defining a UV complete model with these symmetries. We saw one small hint of the role of compactness in the study of charged solutions in linearized gravity where NUT and acceleration charges become available only in that case. The consequences of this fact must be further explored.\nA deeper understanding of this general structure could also be useful for more systematically studying other phases of quantum gravity that could be gapped or, alternatively, present a large number of massless excitations (as in higher-spin theories, for example). An intriguing notion is that string theory could display other, more symmetric, phases (for example, phases with tensionless strings), whose understanding may be crucial to decipher the full non-perturbative structure of the theory. One might hope that biform (or more extended multiform) symmetries could present an avenue of approach to these questions.\nAlong the road, we have also remarked on the intriguing connection between this approach and the physics of fractons. Indeed, gravity can be understood as a gauging of a fractonic global symmetry, and its massless phase corresponds to the gapping of the degrees of freedom charged under the fractonic symmetry, not unlike the massless phase of electromagnetism. Curiously, some stringy physics appeared in this connection, for example one of the structures in the theory naturally couples to a worldsheet (see (2.54), for example). This is rather surprising and mysterious, and it would be interesting to deepen this connection.\nAnother interesting fact we stumbled upon when coupling linearized gravity to background sources associated to the biform symmetries is that this theory is special in d = 4. Only in this dimension does the theory present a trace anomaly for the background fields. The scalar case shows a similar feature in d = 2, which is known to be associated to conformality and the appearance of a Kac-Moody algebra in the extreme infrared. In [6], a\n35Relatedly, (p|p)-biform theories with d < 2p+ 2 have no local propagating degrees of freedom. It would be interesting to understand their features as topological field theories.\n\u2013 57 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nsimilar structure was uncovered for electromagnetism. It is therefore natural to suspect that a similar Kac-Moody enlargement will occur for linearized gravity in d = 4. This possibility is particularly interesting in connection with both the double copy formalism and with soft graviton theorems. One arena where these ideas may find practical application is cosmology. An understanding of the fundamental organizing principles of EFTs for gravitational physics is surely of importance in developing cosmological models. Concretely, understanding the symmetries of gravity will help shed further light on the early universe, where it is expected that spacetime experienced a period of inflationary expansion. This can be interpreted as a partial higgsing of gravity [105\u2013107], where matter degrees of freedom mix with the graviton in the infrared. In much the same way that the Higgs phase of electromagnetism can be viewed as a symmetry-restored phase of the magnetic 1-form symmetry [108, 109], one could imagine that inflation can be understood as a different phase of gravity. In any case, having an EFT definition of the inflationary era based purely on global symmetries is clearly of importance for the further understanding of the microphysics of inflation, and we expect that the (nonlinear extension of) the symmetries explored here will play a role. A step in this direction would be the formulation of these symmetries and anomalies on (anti) de Sitter backgrounds. It would also be interesting to see how the new types of representations such as partially massless fields that are possible in de Sitter space fit into this picture. Beyond this, it is tempting to speculate that gapped phases of gravity could themselves play a role in the early universe, possibly along the lines of [110]. Having discussed at length the infrared properties of gravity, let us come full circle and return to the ultraviolet. One obvious question we can ask is: are there nontrivial UV-complete theories that have these symmetries, say only in their magnetic form. What would such a theory look like?36 Below the mass scale of whatever electric matter breaks the electric biform symmetry, we would expect this electric symmetry to be restored in an emergent way, giving rise to linearized gravity in the infrared. While this is not the theory of gravity that describes our universe (as it would have different nonlinearities from Einstein gravity), it would nevertheless amount to a version of emergent gravity at low energies. More ambitiously, we might hope that these symmetries can deformed in some way so that the nonlinearities of Einstein gravity also emerge at low energies. This would amount to nothing short of an understanding of gravity in the infrared within the framework of the Landau paradigm, which is clearly a worthy goal. We hope to return to these interesting problems in the near future."

(A.15)\nIn general, we can use the explicit form of the projectors that appear in (A.13) to rewrite the propagators (A.15) in terms of the scalar Wightman two-point function, which is given as:\n\u2206W (x; s) = lim \u21920+ \u222b ddp (2\u03c0)d e ip\u00b7x(2\u03c0)\u03b8(p0)\u03b4(s+ p2) . (A.16)\nFor example, in the simple case of two spin 1 currents of dimension \u2206 = d \u2212 1, the projectors are\n\u03a0\u00b5\u03bd0 = p\u00b5p\u03bd\np2 , \u03a0\u00b5\u03bd1 = \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd \u2212\np\u00b5p\u03bd\np2 . (A.17)\nWe can thus obtain the building blocks that appear in (A.15) from (A.16) as\n\u2206\u00b5\u03bdW,0(x; s) = \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd \u2206W (x; s) , \u2206\u00b5\u03bdW,1(x; s) = ( \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u00b5\u2202\u03bd ) \u2206W (x; s) . (A.18)\nNow that we understand how to decompose Wightman functions, we would like to consider the case of time-ordered (or Feynman) propagators.\nTime-ordered two-point functions. To obtain the time-ordered two-point function from the Wightman function, we use the following relation:\n\u30080|J\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p(x)K\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp(0)|0\u3009T = (A.19) \u03b8(x0) \u30080|J\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p(x)K\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp(0)|0\u3009W + \u03b8(\u2212x 0) \u30080|K\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp(0)J\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p(x)|0\u3009W ,\nwhere the subscript T indicates that this is a time-ordered correlator. Using (A.14), we can decompose the time-ordered correlator as\n\u30080|J\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p(x)K\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp(0)|0\u3009T = \u2212i \u2211 j \u222b \u221e 0 ds s\u2206\u2212d/2+1\u03c1j(s)\u2206\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdpF,j (x; s) , (A.20)\nwhere the Feynman propagators are defined as\n\u2212i\u2206\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdpF,j (x; s) = \u03b8(x 0)\u2206\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdpW,j (x; s) + \u03b8(\u2212x 0)\u2206\u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdpW,j (\u2212x; s) , (A.21)\n= lim \u21920+ ddp (2\u03c0)d e\nip\u00b7x\u2212i\u03a0 \u00b51\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b5p\u03bd1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bdp j\np2 + s\u2212 i .

(A.25)\nThe spectral decomposition (A.24) is the form that we use in the main text.\nA.2 Contact terms\nIn this section, we show that we can neglect contact terms when we perform a K\u00e4ll\u00e9nLehmann decomposition, as they never contribute to the spectral function. For simplicity we consider the spectral function of scalars, but the arguments can be readily generalized to cases with spin. We begin by considering a Euclidean momentum space two-point function for real scalars of mass dimension \u2206 in d dimensions, denoted G(p2). The two-point function has mass dimension 2\u2206\u2212 d, and is well-defined and real for all p2 > 0. If we let z \u2261 p2, we can analytically continue to the complex z-plane, and the result should be analytic everywhere except for the negative z axis, i.e., z \u2264 0, where it can have isolated simple poles and a branch cut extending to z = \u2212\u221e. Because we continued a real function, the correlator should obey G(z) = G(z). In particular, if we cross the branch cut, the discontinuity is\nDiscG(z) \u2261 lim \u21920 [G(z + i )\u2212G(z \u2212 i )] = 2i ImG(z) , (A.26)\nwhere the imaginary part is taken above the branch cut.\nUnsubtracted dispersion relation. We can now apply the Cauchy integral formula to a general point z away from the negative axis to write\nG(z) = 12\u03c0i\n\u222e d\u03c9 G(\u03c9)\n\u03c9 \u2212 z , (A.27)\nwhere the contour is a small circle encircling the point z. We can then deform the contour as shown in figure 1. As long as G(z) is bounded by a constant as z \u2192\u221e, we can ignore the circle at infinity and we pick up integrals along the singular points. This implies that\nG(z) = 12\u03c0i lim \u21920 [\u222b 0 \u2212\u221e dsG(s+ i ) s\u2212 z + \u222b \u221e 0 ds(\u22121)G(\u2212s\u2212 i ) \u2212s\u2212 z ] . (A.28)\n37The overall signs of the various spectral densities, \u03c1i, have been left implicit here, and can be fixed by requiring that the spectral density is positive-definite for identical operators.\n\u2013 62 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nz\nFigure 1. The contour deformation used to derive the spectral function. We deform the blue contour centered around z into the green contour that runs along the branch cut with an arc at infinity.\nThe first integral runs to the right over the branch cut with z = s+ i , s = (\u2212\u221e, 0) while the second integral runs to the left under the branch cut with z = \u2212s \u2212 i , s = (0,\u221e). We can then change variables as s\u2192 \u2212s in the first integral, so that we can combine the integrals as\nG(z) = \u2212 12\u03c0i lim \u21920 \u222b \u221e 0 dsG(\u2212s+ i )\u2212G(\u2212s\u2212 i ) s+ z . (A.29)\nWe can now use (A.26) to rewrite this last expression as\nG(z) = \u2212 12\u03c0i \u222b \u221e 0 dsDisc (G(\u2212s)) s+ z = \u2212 1 \u03c0 \u222b \u221e 0 ds ImG(\u2212s) s+ z . (A.30)\nDefining the spectral function\ns\u2206\u2212 d 2 +1\u03c1(s) \u2261 \u2212 1\n\u03c0 ImG(\u2212s) , (A.31)\nso that \u03c1(s) has mass dimension [\u03c1(s)] = \u22122 \u2014 as required for a density \u2014 we can finally write the spectral representation as\nG(z) = \u222b \u221e\n0 ds \u03c1(s)s\n\u2206\u2212 d2 +1\ns+ z . (A.32)\nNote that the condition that G(z) is bounded by a constant together with (A.31) ensures that \u03c1(s)s\u2206\u2212 d2 +1 < const. as s\u2192\u221e, so the integral (A.32) converges at infinity.\nSubtracted dispersion relation. In general, G(z) is only bounded by some power at infinity: G(z) < O (zn) as z \u2192\u221e. In this case, we cannot ignore the contribution from the contour at infinity. Nevertheless, taking the n-th derivative as G(n)(z) \u2261 dndznG(z), we can obtain something that is bounded by a constant so that we can apply the Cauchy theorem for G(n)(z),\nG(n)(z) = n!2\u03c0i \u222e d\u03c9 G(\u03c9)(\u03c9 \u2212 z)n+1 , (A.33)\n\u2013 63 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nand then deform the contour as in figure 1. We obtain\nG(n)(z) = n!2\u03c0i [\u222b 0 \u2212\u221e ds G(s+ i )(s\u2212 z)n+1 + \u222b \u221e 0 ds(\u22121) G(\u2212s\u2212 i )(\u2212s\u2212 z)n+1 ] , (A.34)\n= n! \u03c0\n(\u22121)n+1 \u222b \u221e\n0 ds ImG(\u2212s) s+ z . (A.35)\nUsing the same definition (A.31), we can write\nG(n)(z) = n!(\u22121)n \u222b \u221e\n0 ds\u03c1(s)s\n\u2206\u2212 d2 +1\n(s+ z)n+1 . (A.36)\nNote that (A.36) is formally the derivative of the expression (A.32), but (A.36) converges at infinity given the behavior of G(z) at infinity, whereas (A.32) diverges. In order to recover G(z) from G(n)(z), we take the n-th indefinite integral, which introduces n integration constants c0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cn\u22121 so that\nG(z) = c0 + c1z + c2z2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ cn\u22121zn\u22121 + \u222b z dz1 \u222b z1 dz2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222b zn\u22121 dznG(n)(zn) . (A.37)\nThis is what we call an n-subtracted dispersion relation. The constants c1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cn are subtraction constants and are not determined. Nevertheless, these integration constants multiply polynomials in z = p2, so although they are undetermined, they are just contact terms, contributing only at coincident points in position space. Note that contact terms in correlators are everywhere analytic in z, so they do not affect the discontinuity along the branch cut and hence do not enter the spectral density \u03c1(s)."

            "heading": "B More on the Galileon superfluid",
            "text": "In section 3.2, we analyzed the EFT that describes a Galileon superfluid. There we defined the theory in terms of a current J\u00b5\u03bd that was conserved on shell: \u2202\u00b5J\u00b5\u03bd = 0. This current failed to be antisymmetrically conserved, which was the manifestation of the mixed anomaly in that context. In this appendix, we wish to show how one can move the anomaly around into other conservation conditions by an appropriate definition of the gauge-invariant current.\nB.1 Currents from the action\nHere we want to utilize the Galileon superfluid action to construct currents that manifest the mixed anomaly in a different way from the main text. Our starting point is again (3.22):\nS = \u2212a \u222b ddx ( \u03c6\u2202\u00b5s\u00b5 +\n1 2s \u00b5s\u00b5\n) . (B.1)\nIn order to gauge the symmetries of this action, we proceed slightly differently. We introduce a background two-index symmetric gauge field A\u0303\u00b5|\u03bd (or a (1|1)-biform), that we will separate into a traceless part A\u00b5|\u03bd and its trace B. As in section 3.2, in d 6= 2, the trace B completely decouples so that we can take the background gauge field to be traceless, while in d = 2, we must keep the trace B to obtain a gauge-invariant action.\n\u2013 64 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nThe gauge transformations are slightly different since we have explicitly separated the trace B (they agree with the ones from section 3.2 if we reabsorb B into A\u00b5|\u03bd):\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1 , \u03b4s\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1 , (B.2)\n\u03b4A\u00b5|\u03bd = 1 (1\u2212 g) ( \u2202(\u00b5\u039b\u03bd) \u2212 1 d \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03b1\u039b\u03b1 ) , \u03b4B = 1(1\u2212 g)\u2202\u03b1\u039b \u03b1 . (B.3)\nThe most general gauge-invariant improvement of (B.1) is S = \u2212a \u222b ddx [ \u03c6 ( \u2202\u00b5s\u00b5 \u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdA\u00b5|\u03bd + ( g \u2212 1\nd\n) B ) + 12s\u00b5s \u00b5\n+ d \u03ba2(d\u2212 2) ( \u03ba\u2202\u00b5A\u03bd|\u03b1\u2202 \u00b5A\u03bd|\u03b1 \u2212 2\u2202\u00b5A\u00b5|\u03b1\u2202\u03bdA\u03bd|\u03b1 ) + (\u03ba+ g \u2212 1)\u2202\u00b5B\u2202\u03bdA\u00b5|\u03bd + \u2212d(\u03ba+ g2 \u2212 1) + \u03ba+ 2g \u2212 2\n2d \u2202\u00b5B\u2202 \u00b5B\n] ,\n(B.4)\nwith a a free normalization. The action (B.4) has two free parameters (g and \u03ba), and is slightly different than (3.46) because of the way we separated the trace. Looking at (B.4), it is already clear that d = 2 is special.\nWhen d 6= 2, we can choose\n\u03ba = d\u2212 1 d , g = 1 d , (B.5)\nin which case the trace B totally decouples from the rest of the action and we obtain the same action as in section 3.2. When d = 2, the choice of parameters is impossible because the terms that are quadratic in A\u00b5|\u03bd diverge, and we must keep the trace B explicitly. The equation of motion for s\u00b5 is unchanged compared to the ungauged version of the action \u2202\u00b5\u03c6\u2212 s\u00b5 = 0 , (B.6) which allows us to solve for s\u00b5 in terms of \u03c6, while varying the action (B.4) with respect to \u03c6, we obtain\n\u03c6\u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdA\u00b5|\u03bd + ( g \u2212 1\nd\n) B = 0 , (B.7)\nwhere we have used (B.6).\nConserved current. To derive the current, we need to vary the action (B.4) with respect to the background gauge fields that we introduced. Since A\u00b5|\u03bd is identically traceless, we need to remove the traces when we perform the variation, this produces\nJ\u00b5|\u03bd \u2261 \u03b4S\n\u03b4A\u00b5|\u03bd = a\n[ \u2202(\u00b5\u2202\u03bd)\u03c6\u2212 \u03ba d d\u2212 2 [ 2\u2202\u03b1\u2202(\u00b5A\u03bd)|\u03b1 \u2212 A\u00b5|\u03bd ] + (\u03ba+ g \u2212 1)\u2202(\u00b5\u2202\u03bd)B\n\u2212 \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd d\n( \u03c6\u2212 2\u03ba d\nd\u2212 2\u2202 \u03b1\u2202\u00b5A\u00b5|\u03b1 + (\u03ba+ g \u2212 1) B\n)] .\n(B.8)\nIn order to be able to impose dual conservation on the current instead of standard conservation, we note that the variation of the action with respect to B is also gauge invariant\nJ \u2261 \u03b4S \u03b4B\n= a [ \u2212 ( g \u2212 1\nd\n) \u03c6+ (\u03ba+ g \u2212 1)\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdA\u00b5|\u03bd +\n\u2212d(\u03ba+ g2 \u2212 1) + \u03ba+ 2g \u2212 2 d\nB ] ,\n(B.9)\n\u2013 65 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nso that we can consider the following general current\nJ\u00b5|\u03bd \u2261 J\u00b5|\u03bd + \u03b2 \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd J , (B.10)\nwhere \u03b2 is a free parameter. For different choice of parameters g, \u03ba, and \u03b2, the current (B.10) will obey different conditions. In order to express them simply, it is useful to define the gauge-invariant combination\nFd \u2261 \u2212\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2A\u03b1|\u03b2 + d\u2212 1 d B .

(B.13)\n\u2022 Dual divergence: computing the dual divergence of (B.10) yields\n\u2202[\u03b1J\u00b5]|\u03bd = a [ \u2212 d \u03ba d\u2212 2 ( \u2202\u03b2\u2202\u03bd\u2202[\u03b1A\u00b5]|\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202[\u03b1A\u00b5]|\u03bd ) (B.14)\n+ ( \u03b2 ( 1\u2212 \u03ba\u2212 1\nd ) + 1 d \u2212 2\u03ba d\u2212 2 ) \u03b7\u03bd[\u03b1\u2202\u00b5]\u2202 \u03c1\u2202\u03c3A\u03c1|\u03c3\n\u2212 (1 + d(\u03ba\u2212 1))(1 + \u03b2(d\u2212 1) d2\n\u03b7\u03bd[\u03b1\u2202\u00b5] B ] .\nWe now want to explore how many of these conditions we can impose simultaneously. As before, it will be necessary to consider d = and d 6= 2 separately.\n\u2022 d > 2 : in this case, we can choose\n\u03ba = d\u2212 1 d , (B.15)\nso that the current is both traceless and conserved for any value of g and \u03b2. This is the case that we considered in detail in the main text. In this case, we cannot choose \u03b2 to ensure dual conservation, and we obtain\n\u2202[\u03b1J\u00b5]|\u03bd = \u2212 a d\u2212 2 [ (d\u2212 1) ( \u2202\u03b2\u2202\u03bd\u2202[\u03b1A\u00b5]|\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202[\u03b1A\u00b5]|\u03bd ) + \u03b7\u03bd[\u03b1\u2202\u00b5]\u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3A\u03c1|\u03c3 ] .\n(B.16) Alternatively, we can choose\n\u03ba = 0 , \u03b2 = \u2212 1 d\u2212 1 , (B.17)\nwhich ensures dual conservation. In this case, the current is neither traceless nor conserved:\nJ \u00b5\u00b5 = \u2212aFd , \u2202\u00b5J\u00b5|\u03bd = \u2212a\u2202\u03bdFd . (B.18)\n\u2013 66 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\n\u2022 d = 2 : in two dimensions, we cannot choose \u03ba as in (B.15) because then the action (B.4) has some divergent contact terms. We then choose \u03ba = 0 which implies\nJ \u00b5\u00b5 = a \u03b2 F2 , (B.19) \u2202\u00b5J\u00b5|\u03bd = 1 2a(\u03b2 \u2212 1)\u2202\u03bdF2, (B.20)\n\u2202[\u03b1J\u00b5]|\u03bd = a 1 + \u03b2\n2 \u03b7\u03bd[\u03b1\u2202\u00b5]F2 . (B.21)\nLooking at (B.19)\u2013(B.21), it is clear that in two dimensions, we have a three-way anomaly, where we can choose the current J\u00b5\u03bd to be one of traceless (\u03b2 = 0), conserved (\u03b2 = 1) or dual conserved (\u03b2 = \u22121).\nThis structure of anomalies exactly matches the possible conditions that we can impose on the current two-point function, as we now explore.\nB.2 Current two-point function\nNext, we enumerate the possible conditions that one can impose on the currents appearing in the two-point function. In momentum space, the most general form for this correlator with the appropriate symmetries is (3.54):\n\u3008J\u00b51|\u00b52 \u2217K\u2217\u03bd1|\u03bd2\u3009 = 2c1(p 2)p2\u03b7\u00b51(\u03bd2\u03b7\u03bd1)\u00b52 + c2(p 2)p2\u03b7\u00b51\u00b52\u03b7\u03bd1\u03bd2 + c3(p2)\u03b7\u00b51\u00b52p\u03bd1p\u03bd2 + c4(p2)\u03b7\u03bd1\u03bd2p\u00b51p\u00b52 + 2c5(p2) ( \u03b7\u00b52(\u03bd2p\u03bd1)p\u00b51 + \u03b7\u00b51(\u03bd2p\u03bd1)p\u00b52 ) + c6(p2)\np\u00b51p\u00b52p\u03bd1p\u03bd2 p2 ,\n(B.22) where c1(p2), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , c6(p2) are all arbitrary functions of p2 and we have not assumed any symmetry under (\u00b51\u00b52) \u2194 (\u03bd1\u03bd2) exchange. We now impose various conditions on the currents. As before we see that we have to separate the d = 2 case from the generic case.\nIn d 6= 2 dimensions. When d 6= 2, we can impose the following:\n\u2022 Tracelessness and conservation: requiring the current J to be both traceless and conserved at coincident points implies\nc1(p2) = \u2212 1 2(d\u2212 1)c2(p 2) , c3(p2) = c4(p2) = \u2212c2(p2) , (B.23) c5(p2) = 1 2(d\u2212 1)c2(p 2) , c6(p2) = \u2212(d\u2212 2)c2(p2) . (B.24)\nUsing the anomaly equation as in the main text, which is given in (3.56), we can fix c2(p2) \u2014 which cannot be chosen so that J is also dual conserved:\nc2(p2) = \u2212 1\nd\u2212 2 , (B.25)\nsuch that the correlator is the one given in (3.57).\n\u2013 67 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\n\u2022 Dual conservation: in this case, we require that the current is dual conserved, which means p[\u03b1 \u3008J\u00b51|\u00b52(p) \u2217K \u2217\u03bd1]|\u03bd2 (\u2212p)\u3009 = 0 everywhere. This implies\nc1(p2) = c2(p2) = c4(p2) = c5(p2) = 0 . (B.26)\nWe cannot choose c3,6(p2) to either ensure tracelessness nor conservation. Using the trace and conservation anomaly equations\n\u3008J \u00b51\u00b51| (p) \u2217K \u2217\u03bd1|\u03bd2 (\u2212p)\u3009 = p\u03bd1p\u03bd2 , p \u00b51 \u3008J\u00b51|\u00b52 (p) \u2217K \u2217\u03bd1|\u03bd2 (\u2212p)\u3009 = p\u00b52p\u03bd1p\u03bd2 ,\n(B.27) we can fix c3(p2) = 0, c6(p2) = 1 so that the correlator is\n\u3008J\u00b51|\u00b52(p) \u2217K \u2217\u03bd1|\u03bd2 (\u2212p)\u3009 = p\u00b51p\u00b52p\u03bd1p\u03bd2\np2 . (B.28)\nIn d = 2 dimensions. When d = 2, the tensor structure multiplied by c1(p2) in the ansatz (B.22) is not linearly independent from the other structures, so we can set c1(p2) = 0. We now see that we can impose fewer conditions:\n\u2022 Conserved: requiring conservation, and using the trace anomaly equation\n\u3008J \u00b51\u00b51| (p) \u2217K \u2217\u03bd1|\u03bd2 (\u2212p)\u3009 = p 2\u03b7\u03bd1\u03bd2 \u2212 p\u03bd1p\u03bd2 , (B.29)\nwe can uniquely fix the two-point function to be\n\u3008J\u00b51|\u00b52(p)\u2217K\u2217\u03bd1|\u03bd2 (\u2212p)\u3009d=2 = p 2\u03b7\u00b51\u00b52\u03b7\u03bd1\u03bd2\u2212\u03b7\u00b51\u00b52p\u03bd1p\u03bd2\u2212\u03b7\u03bd1\u03bd2p\u00b51p\u00b52 + p\u00b51p\u00b52p\u03bd1p\u03bd2 p2 .\n(B.30)\nWe can check that this also agrees with the dual conservation anomaly equation.\n\u2022 Dual conserved: for this case, there is actually nothing that changes compared to the d 6= 2 computation that we performed above. The two-point function thus has the form shown in (3.58)\nWe see that the possible conditions and anomalous conservation equations agree perfectly with the analysis of section B.1 based on the IR EFT action."

            "text": "In this appendix, we work out the details of the EFT that has a (1|0)-biform symmetry, which is the simplest example of the theories discussed in section 2.4. The relevant Goldstone mode is a vector gauge field, so this EFT coincides with electromagnetism in the deep infrared, but has different (more restricted) allowed interactions. Much as in the other examples, the presence of the gapless photon in this theory is a consequence of a mixed anomaly between electric and magnetic symmetries.\n\u2013 68 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nC.1 Summary of Maxwell theory\nWe first briefly review Maxwell electromagnetism in its usual formulation, in order to contrast with the presentation in the subsequent section. More details can be found for example in [4, 113, 114]. We work in general dimension d and denote the gauge coupling as g. This theory is usually described using a 1-form (electric) gauge field, a(1), that is associated to the usual (electric) field strength F(2) = da(1). This theory has two different conserved currents\nJ(2) \u2261 1 g2 F(2) , K(d\u22122) \u2261 \u2217F(2) . (C.1)\nThese currents are associated to two global higher-form symmetries: an electric 1-form symmetry with current J(2) and a (d\u2212 3)-form magnetic symmetry with current K(d\u22122). The objects charged under these symmetries are Wilson (electric) and \u2019t Hooft (magnetic) lines, and one can define conserved charges as:\nQe = \u222e\n\u03a3d\u22122 \u2217F(2) , Qm = \u222e \u03a32 F(2) . (C.2)\nWe can gauge the electric symmetry by including a background source B(2) for the electric current so that the theory is invariant under arbitrary shifts a(1) 7\u2192 a(1) + \u03be(1). The currents (C.1) can be improved to preserve gauge invariance as\nJ(2) \u2192 J(2) = 1 g2\n( F(2) \u2212B(2) ) , K(d\u22122) \u2192 K(d\u22122) = \u2217 ( F(2) \u2212B(2) ) , (C.3)\nwhere under a gauge transformation B(2) 7\u2192 B(2) + d\u03be(1). The equations above imply a mixed anomaly between the conserved currents in the form\nd \u2217 J(2) = 0 , (C.4) d \u2217 K(d\u22122) = \u2212 dB(2) . (C.5)\nThese equations continue to hold even in the presence of interactions, so long as they preserve the higher-form symmetries. Interactions would change the form of the electric symmetry current, but it would have the same anomaly with the magnetic symmetry.\nC.1.1 Two-point function\nThis anomaly structure is enough to guarantee that the theory is in a gapless phase, with the photon appearing as a Goldstone mode. With the above input, we can compute the current-current two-point function in electromagnetism. We are interested in the correlator\n\u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(p) \u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2(\u2212p)\u3009 \u2261 \u222b ddx eix\u00b7p \u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(x) \u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2(0)\u3009 . (C.6)\nThe most general form that this can take consistent with Lorentz invariance is\n\u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(p)\u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2(\u2212p)\u3009=\u22122c1(p2)p2 ( \u03b7\u00b51[\u03bd1\u03b7\u03bd2]\u00b52 ) +2c2(p2) ( \u03b7\u03bd1[\u00b51p\u00b51]p\u03bd2\u2212\u03b7\u03bd2[\u00b51p\u00b52]p\u03bd1 ) ,\n(C.7)\n\u2013 69 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nwhich depends on two unknown functions c1(p2) and c2(p2) that are fixed by the conservation equations. Requiring (C.4) and (C.5) to be satisfied, we have\np\u00b51 \u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(p) \u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2(\u2212p)\u3009 = 0 , =\u21d2 c1(p2) = c2(p2) , (C.8)\np[\u03b1 \u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(p) \u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2](\u2212p)\u3009 = p[\u03b1\u03b4 \u00b5 \u03c3\u03b4 \u03bd \u03c1] , =\u21d2 c2(p2) = 1 2p2 . (C.9)\nThe mixed correlator is therefore entirely fixed and takes the form\n\u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(p)\u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2(\u2212p)\u3009= \u03b7\u00b52\u03bd2p\u00b51p\u03bd1 +\u03b7\u00b51\u03bd1p\u00b52p\u03bd2\u2212\u03b7\u00b51\u03bd2p\u00b52p\u03bd1\u2212\u03b7\u00b52\u03bd1p\u00b52p\u03bd2\n2p2 \u2212\u03b7\u00b51[\u03bd1\u03b7\u03bd2]\u00b52 . (C.10)\nThe 1/p2 pole is a robust consequence of the anomaly, as in the superfluid case. Moreover, the contact terms can be redefined at will to choose which of the two currents should be conserved even at coincident points. If we instead require the magnetic current to be identically conserved, we obtain\n\u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(p) \u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2(\u2212p)\u3009 = 1 2 \u03b7\u00b52\u03bd2p\u00b51p\u03bd1 + \u03b7\u00b51\u03bd1p\u00b52p\u03bd2 \u2212 \u03b7\u00b51\u03bd2p\u00b52p\u03bd1 \u2212 \u03b7\u00b52\u03bd1p\u00b52p\u03bd2 p2 .\n(C.11) The difference between the two correlators (C.10) and (C.11) is simply a local contact term.\nK\u00e4ll\u00e9n-Lehmann decomposition. We can now perform the spectral decomposition of this correlator to verify that there is a massless spin-1 particle in the spectrum: the photon. Using the results from appendix A, we can write the spectral function for an antisymmetric current,\n\u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(p) \u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2(\u2212p)\u3009 = \u222b \u221e\n0 ds s p2 + s\n( \u2212\u03c11(s)\u03a0\u0303\u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd21,em + \u03c1(2|0)(s)\u03a0\u0303 \u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd2 (2|0),em ) .\n(C.12) The spectral densities \u03c11 and \u03c1(2|0) capture the coupling of spin-1 states and antisymmetric tensor states respectively (Massless antisymmetric tensor states cannot couple to the anti-symmetric current [67, 68] so the density \u03c1(2|0) must go to zero as s\u2192 0).\nThe projector \u03a0\u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd21,em is that of a spin-1 particle while \u03a0 \u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd2 (2|0),em is the projector\nfor a rank 2 antisymmetric tensor particle (a 2-form). They are uniquely defined by the requirements that they be traceless, transverse, and complete on the space of traceless antisymmetric tensors.

(C.14)\nThe tensors appearing in (C.12) are projectors only on-shell, given by replacing p2 \u2192 \u2212s,\n\u03a0\u0303\u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd21,em = \u2212 1 s\n( \u03b7\u00b51[\u03bd1p\u03bd2]p\u00b52 \u2212 \u03b7\u00b52[\u03bd1p\u03bd2]p\u00b51 ) , (C.15)\n\u03a0\u0303\u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd2(2|0),em = ( \u03b7\u00b5[\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3]\u03bd ) + 1 s ( \u03b7\u00b51[\u03bd1p\u03bd2]p\u00b52 \u2212 \u03b7\u00b52[\u03bd1p\u03bd2]p\u00b51 ) . (C.16)\n\u2013 70 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nUsing these two projectors, we can write respectively (C.10) and (C.11) as\n\u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(p) \u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2(\u2212p)\u3009 = \u221212\u03a0 \u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd2 1,em , (C.17) \u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(p) \u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2(\u2212p)\u3009 = 12\u03a0 \u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd2 (2|0),em . (C.18)\nWriting (C.12) as\n\u3008J\u00b51\u00b52(p) \u2217K\u03bd1\u03bd2(\u2212p)\u3009 = (\u222b \u221e\n0 ds s\u03c1(2|0)(s) p2 + s\n) \u03b7\u00b5[\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3]\u03bd (C.19)\n+ (\u222b \u221e\n0 ds \u03c1(2|0)(s) + \u03c11(s) p2 + s\n)( \u03b7\u00b51[\u03bd1p\u03bd2]p\u00b52 \u2212 \u03b7\u00b52[\u03bd1p\u03bd2]p\u00b51 ) ,\nwe see that the two-point function of pure Maxwell theory, (C.11), is recovered by taking\n\u03c1(2|0)(s) = 0 , \u03c11(s) = \u03b4(s) . (C.20)\nThis shows that there is a massless spin-1 particle (the photon) in the spectrum.\nC.2 Galileon electromagnetism\nWe now turn to the study of the galileonic version of electromagnetism that has biform symmetries. The approach is philosophically similar to the discussion of the Galileon superfluid in section 3.2. The EFT that we construct will have a larger set of global symmetries than ordinary electromagnetism, and so will have different irrelevant corrections. We begin by writing the free Maxwell action in a first-order form that manifests more of its symmetries. Consider a vector field a\u00b5 together with a symmetric two-index tensor (or a (1|1)-biform) s\u00b5|\u03bd . Electromagnetism can be written in a Palatini-like form as\nS = \u2212 1 g2\n\u222b ddx [ a\u03bd ( \u2202\u00b5s\u00b5|\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bds ) + 12 ( s\u00b5|\u03bds \u00b5|\u03bd \u2212 s2 )] , (C.21)\nwhere we defined the trace s = s \u00b5\u00b5| . The action (C.21) is invariant under the gauge transformations\n\u03b4a\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5\u039b , \u03b4s\u00b5\u03bd = \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd\u039b , (C.22)\nwhere \u039b is an arbitrary scalar function. The equations of motion of (C.21) are\ns\u00b5|\u03bd = \u2202(\u00b5a\u03bd) , \u2202\u03b1s\u03b1|\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bds = 0 . (C.23)\nCombining these two equations, we find the ordinary Maxwell equation in vacuum\n\u2202\u00b5 (\u2202\u00b5a\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bda\u00b5) = \u2202\u00b5F\u00b5\u03bd = 0 . (C.24)\nIt is interesting to note that we obtained an equation for the antisymmetric Maxwell tensor despite the fact that the fundamental object s\u00b5\u03bd that we used to construct the action (C.21) is symmetric. Integrating out s\u00b5\u03bd via its equation of motion recovers the usual Maxwell action.\n\u2013 71 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nFrom the first-order action (C.21), we can now see that it has a second set of 1-form symmetries, which can be written as\n\u03b4a\u03bd = ( \u2202\u03b1\u039b\u00b5|\u03b1 + \u2202\u03b1\u03be\u00b5\u03b1 ) + \u2202\u00b5\u039b\u03b1|\u03b1 , (C.25)\n\u03b4s\u00b5|\u03bd = ( \u2202\u03b1\u2202(\u00b5\u039b\u03bd)\u03b1 + \u2202\u03b1\u2202(\u00b5\u03be\u03bd)\u03b1 ) + \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd\u039b\u03b1|\u03b1 , (C.26)\nwhere \u039b\u00b5|\u03bd is a symmetric two tensor, while \u03be\u00b5\u03bd is a two-form Killing tensor that solves (2.72). This is a symmetry of the action (C.21) provided we impose the flatness condition\n\u2202\u03b1\u2202[\u00b5\u039b\u03bd]|\u03b1 = 0 . (C.27)\nWe now want to gauge these symmetries so that \u039b can be an arbitrary function.\nC.2.1 Coupling to sources\nWe gauge the higher-form symmetries (C.25) and (C.26) by introducing a background gauge field that couples to the conserved current. Because we anticipate a trace anomaly in special dimension, we will consider a traceful background gauge field B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 expecting that we can decouple its trace generally. The background gauge field B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 is a (2|1)-biform. The current associated to this symmetry, following the discussion in 2.4 is\nH\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = \u2202\u00b5s\u03bd|\u03c1 \u2212 \u2202\u03bds\u00b5|\u03c1 , (C.28)\nand is traceless on-shell using the equations of motion (C.23). We consider the following gauge transformations\n\u03b4a\u03bd = 6(1\u2212 `) (1\n3\u2202 \u03b1\u039b\u00b5|\u03b1 + \u2202\u03b1\u03be\u00b5\u03b1\n) + \u2202\u00b5\u039b\u03b1|\u03b1 , (C.29)\n\u03b4s\u00b5|\u03bd = 6(1\u2212 `) (1\n3\u2202 \u03b1\u2202(\u00b5\u039b\u03bd)\u03b1 + \u2202\u03b1\u2202(\u00b5\u03be\u03bd)\u03b1\n) + \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd\u039b\u03b1|\u03b1 , (C.30)\n\u03b4B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 3Y(2|1) (\u2202\u00b5\u039b\u03bd\u03c1 + \u2202\u00b5\u03be\u03bd\u03c1) , (C.31)\nwhere we have chosen the normalization for later convenience, and ` is a free coefficient. In (C.29)\u2013(C.31), the gauge parameter \u039b\u00b5|\u03bd is a symmetric 2-tensor (or a (1|1)-biform) while \u03be\u00b5\u03bd is an antisymmetric tensor (or a 2-form).

The equation of motion for s\u00b5|\u03bd is unchanged from (C.23)\u2014and sets s\u00b5\u03bd in terms of a\u00b5 \u2014 while the equation of motion for a\u00b5 is\na\u00b5 \u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03c1a\u03c1 \u2212 2\u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c3B\u03c1\u00b5|\u03c3 \u2212 2` (\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03b1B\u03b1 \u2212 B\u00b5) = 0 . (C.33)\n\u2013 72 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nTo obtain the current of interest, we vary the action (C.32) with respect to B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1:\nH\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 1 g2\n( \u2202\u03c1\u2202[\u00b5a\u03bd] \u2212 B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 ) , (C.34)\nwhere we have defined\nB\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 =\u2212Y(2|1) [ \u03ba ( 3\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u00b5B\u03c1\u03b1|\u03bd+3\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03bdB\u03c1\u03b1|\u00b5\u2212 B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 ) (C.35)\n\u22123(1+\u03ba) ( \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202 \u03b1\u2202\u03b2B\u03c1\u03b1|\u03b2+\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd ( B\u03c1\u2212\u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03b1B\u03b1) ) +3(1+\u03ba\u2212`)\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bdB\u03c1 ] ,\nand have used the equation of motion (C.33) to replace a\u00b5. It is straightforward to check that the current (C.34) is gauge invariant. Moreover, it is conserved for both divergences\n\u2202\u00b5H\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 0 , \u2202\u03c1H\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 0 , (C.36)\nfor any \u03ba. This is a consequence of the way we have introduced the gauge field B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1, which is designed to couple to a conserved current.\nC.2.2 Anomalies\nWe now want to understand how the introduction of the background gauge field B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 changes the properties of the current (C.34). The current is conserved on-shell, but the other conditions (tracelessness and dual conservation) do not need to be satisfied, and we have some freedom to tune \u03ba and ` to enforce different conditions. In order to explore the anomaly structure, we need to compute the on-shell conditions for (C.34).\n\u2022 Trace: the on-shell trace of the current (C.34) is\nH\u03c1\u00b5|\u03c1 = \u2212 (d\u2212 2 + \u03ba(d\u2212 3))\ng2\n( \u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2B\u03b1\u00b5|\u03b2 + \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03b1B\u03b1 \u2212 B\u00b5 ) . (C.37)\nIt is straightforward to check that this is gauge invariant.\n\u2022 Dual conservation: the on-shell dual conservation is\n\u2202[\u03b1H\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03c1 = \u2212 1 g2 \u2202[\u03b1B\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03c1 , (C.38)\nwhich is also gauge invariant.\nWe now want to explore what conditions we can require that the current satisfy. It is already clear that the current cannot be made to be both traceless and dual conserved. In fact, it is impossible to enforce dual conservation (C.38) for any choice of parameters, because we have required the current to be conserved instead. This is the expression of a mixed anomaly between the electric and magnetic biform symmetries. However, we see from (C.37) that we can set the trace to zero in d 6= 3, so it is convenient to split the discussion into two cases, d 6= 3 and d = 3. We will consider the generic case first.\n\u2013 73 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nIn d 6= 3 dimensions. In general dimension, it is possible to make the current H\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 simultaneously conserved and traceless by choosing\n\u03ba = \u2212d\u2212 2 d\u2212 3 . (C.39)\nWith the further choice ` = 1\nd\u2212 1 , (C.40)\nthe trace B\u00b5 decouples from the action (C.32) so that we obtain\nS = \u2212 1 g2\n\u222b ddx [ a\u03bd ( \u2202\u00b5s\u00b5|\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bds\u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03c1B (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 ) + 12 ( s\u00b5|\u03bds \u00b5|\u03bd \u2212 s2 )\n(C.41)\n\u2212d\u2212 2 d\u2212 3\n( \u2202\u00b5B \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 (T ) \u2202 \u03c3B (T ) \u03c1\u03c3|\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u00b5B \u03bd\u03c1|\u00b5 (T ) \u2202 \u03c3B (T ) \u03bd\u03c1|\u03c3 + 1 2\u2202\u03c3B (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1\u2202 \u03c3B \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 (T ) )] ,\nwhere we have introduced the traceless part of B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 defined as\nB (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 \u2212 2 d\u2212 1\u03b7 \u03c1[\u00b5B\u03bd] . (C.42)\nThe action (C.41) is invariant under the gauge transformations (C.29)\u2013(C.31) with traceless gauge parameters. The fact that only the traceless part of B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 couples to the dynamical fields will imply that the corresponding current H\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 is now traceless off-shell. This current can be written as\nH\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 1 g2\n( \u2202\u03c1\u2202[\u00b5a\u03bd] \u2212 B (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 ) , (C.43)\nwhere the traceless version of B is\nB(T )\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = d\u2212 2 d\u2212 3Y(2|1) [ 3\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u00b5B(T )\u03c1\u03b1|\u03bd + 3\u2202 \u03b1\u2202\u03bdB (T ) \u03c1\u03b1|\u00b5 \u2212 B (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 + 3 d\u2212 2\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202 \u03b1\u2202\u03b2B (T ) \u03b1\u03c1|\u03b2 ] .\n(C.44) In fact, (C.44) is the unique tensor that is traceless, has the correct index symmetries, and transforms appropriately under the gauge transformations, so that the current (C.43) is gauge invariant. Indeed, we could have worked directly at the level of the current and introduced (C.44) in order to gauge the relevant symmetries. This current satisfies\nH\u00b5\u03bd|\u00b5 = 0 , \u2202 \u03c1H\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 0 ,\n\u2202\u00b5H\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 0 , \u2202[\u03c3H\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03c1 = \u2202[\u03c3B\u0303 (d) \u00b5\u03bd]|\u03c1 ,\n(C.45)\nwhere the tensor appearing in the magnetic conservation equation is\nB\u0303(d)\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = d\u2212 2 g2(d\u2212 3)Y(2|1) ( \u22123\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u00b5B(T )\u03c1\u03b1|\u03bd + B (T ) \u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 \u2212 3 d\u2212 2\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2202 \u03b1\u2202\u03b2B (T ) \u03b1\u03c1|\u03b2 ) . (C.46)\nNote that this differs slightly from (C.44) because there are contributions from the equations of motion to the right hand side of the dual conservation equation. Our inability to satisfy both the electric and magnetic conservation laws at the same time is a consequence of a mixed \u2019t Hooft anomaly between these global biform symmetries.\n\u2013 74 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nIn d = 3 dimensions. As we can see from this appearance of (d \u2212 3) factors in the previous discussion (for example in (C.39)), something is special in d = 3. In this case, it is impossible to choose the two free parameters ` and \u03ba to make the current simultaneously traceless and conserved. The best that we can do is to satisfy the equations\nH\u00b5\u03bd|\u00b5 = B\u0303 (3) \u03bd , \u2202 \u03c1H\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 0 ,\n\u2202\u00b5H\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 0 , \u2202[\u03c3H\u00b5\u03bd]|\u03c1 = \u2202[\u03c3B\u0303 (3) \u00b5\u03bd]|\u03c1 ,\n(C.47)\nwhere the field strengths appearing in (C.47) are\nB\u0303(3)\u03bd = \u2212 1 g2\n( \u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2B\u03b1\u03bd|\u03b2 + (\u2202\u03bd\u2202\u03b1B\u03b1 \u2212 B\u03bd ) , (C.48)\ntogether with\nB\u0303(3)\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 1 g2 Y(2|1)\n[ \u03ba ( 3\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u00b5B\u03c1\u03b1|\u03bd \u2212 B\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 ) \u2212 3 (1 + \u03ba) \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd ( \u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2B\u03c1\u03b1|\u03b2 + B\u03c1 ) ] .\n(C.49) Interestingly, we see that the minimal anomaly in d = 3 also involves a trace anomaly. Here we have given a particular presentation of the mixed anomaly between the various conservation conditions. By including different contact terms (corresponding to terms quadratic in the gauge field) or gauging the theory in different variables one can shuffle around the anomaly into failures of different conservations conditions. However, the incompatibility between electric and magnetic conservations cannot be changed. This is similar to what we showed in appendix B for the Galileon superfluid.\nC.2.3 Two-point function\nWe now want to consider the current two-point function in this theory and show both that the structure of mixed anomalies completely fixes its structure and that the spectral decomposition has a massless spin-1 in the spectrum. The most general form of such a correlator consistent with Lorentz invariance is\n\u3008H\u00b51\u00b52|\u00b53(p) \u2217 I \u2217\u03bd1\u03bd2|\u03bd3 (\u2212p)\u3009 =\n9Y2,1Y2,1 [ c1(p2)\n8 p 2\u03b7\u00b51\u03bd1\u03b7\u00b52\u03bd2\u03b7\u00b53\u03bd3 \u2212 c2(p2) 4 p 2\u03b7\u00b51\u03bd1\u03b7\u00b52\u00b53\u03b7\u03bd2\u03bd3\n\u2212 c3(p 2) 8 p\u00b51p\u00b52\u03b7\u00b53\u03bd2\u03b7\u03bd1\u03bd3 + c4(p2) 4 p\u00b51p\u03bd1\u03b7\u00b52\u00b53\u03b7\u03bd2\u03bd3 + c5(p2) 4 p\u00b51p\u03bd1\u03b7\u00b53\u03bd2\u03b7\u00b52\u03bd3 + c6(p 2)\n4 p\u00b53p\u03bd3\u03b7\u00b51\u03bd1\u03b7\u00b52\u03bd2 + c7(p2) 8 p\u03bd1p\u03bd3\u03b7\u00b51\u03bd2\u03b7\u00b52\u00b53 + c8(p2) 4 \u03b7\u00b51\u03bd1p\u00b52p\u00b53p\u03bd2p\u03bd3 p2\n] ,\n(C.50)\nwhere I(d\u22122|d\u22121) is the current associated to the magnetic biform symmetry and Y2,1Y2,1 is the projector on the Young tableau:\n\u00b51 \u00b53 \u00b52 \u2297 \u03bd1 \u03bd3 \u03bd2 . (C.51)\nIt is again convenient to consider the generic case and d = 3 separately.\n\u2013 75 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nIn d 6= 3 dimensions. We can use the conservation equations we just derived to fix the current-current two-point function (C.50). When d 6= 3, we know that we can choose a traceless background gauge field so that our current with be both traceless and conserved. The last free coefficient is fixed by the anomalous dual conservation equation (C.45).\nRequiring both tracelessness and conservation\ntr ( H\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 ) = H\u00b5\u03bd|\u00b5 = 0 , \u2202 \u00b5H\u00b5\u03bd|\u03c1 = 0 , (C.52)\nand using the anomalous conservation equation, we obtain\nc1 = 2(d\u22122) 3g2(d\u22123) , c2 = c3 = c4 =\u2212c6 = 2 g2(d\u22123) , c5 =\u2212 4(d\u22122) 3g2(d\u22123) , c8 = 2 g2 .\n(C.53) We can write the correlator in terms of the projectors that we will derive shortly. We obtain:\n\u3008H\u00b51\u00b52|\u00b53(p) \u2217 I \u2217\u03bd1\u03bd2|\u03bd3 (\u2212p)\u3009 = p 2(d\u2212 2) g2(d\u2212 3)\u03a0 \u00b51\u00b52\u00b53\u03bd1\u03bd2\u03bd3 (2|1) , (C.54)\nwhere the projector is given in equation (C.59).\nIn d = 3 dimensions. In three dimensions, we can rederive the two-point function with the different set of conservation equations (C.47). We obtain the exact same non-local terms, while the local contact terms are different, and in particular have a trace, since we cannot require that the current be tracelessness. Nevertheless, the non-local part of the correlator is exactly the same, and hence we reach the same conclusion after performing a spectral decomposition: there is a massless state in the spectrum, which is the photon.\nK\u00e4ll\u00e9n-Lehmann decomposition. We can now perform a spectral decomposition of the correlator to show that there is a massless spin-1 particle in the spectrum.

This object is a tensor with 8 indices that is constructed out of the metric \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd and the momentum p\u00b5. The general structure of the ansatz is the following:\n\u3008J\u00b51\u00b52\u00b53\u00b54 \u2217K\u2217\u03bd1\u03bd2\u03bd3\u03bd4\u3009 = 27\u2211 i=1 ei(p2)T (i)\u00b51\u00b52\u00b53\u00b54\u03bd1\u03bd2\u03bd3\u03bd4 , (D.10)\nwhere there are 27 terms that are pairwise antisymmetric (meaning they are antisymmetric in [\u00b51\u00b52] , [\u00b53\u00b54] , [\u03bd1\u03bd2] , [\u03bd3\u03bd4]). The coefficients ei(p2) are arbitrary functions of p2, and we will not write the tensor structures T (i)\u00b51\u00b52\u00b53\u00b54\u03bd1\u03bd2\u03bd3\u03bd4 explicitly, as they are straightforward but tedious to obtain. Nevertheless the counting is the following: first, there are six terms which are built only out of metrics of the schematic form\nT (i)\u00b51\u00b52\u00b53\u00b54\u03bd1\u03bd2\u03bd3\u03bd4 \u223c p 2\u03b7\u00b51\u00b53\u03b7\u00b52\u00b54\u03b7\u03bd1\u03bd3\u03b7\u03bd2\u03bd4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (D.11)\nwhere the \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 contain all the contributions needed by symmetry, and we have introduced the factor of p2 since we know this is how the Weyl tensor two-point function scales in linearized gravity. Second, there are eighteen terms with two momenta and three metrics which are schematically given as\nT (j)\u00b51\u00b52\u00b53\u00b54\u03bd1\u03bd2\u03bd3\u03bd4 \u223c \u03b7\u00b51\u00b53\u03b7\u00b52\u00b54\u03b7\u03bd1\u03bd3p\u03bd2p\u03bd4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (D.12)\nThird, there are three terms with four momenta and two metrics, which are schematically\nT (k)\u00b51\u00b52\u00b53\u00b54\u03bd1\u03bd2\u03bd3\u03bd4 \u223c 1 p2 \u03b7\u00b52\u00b54\u03b7\u03bd2\u03bd4p\u00b51p\u03bd1p\u00b53p\u03bd3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (D.13)\nNote that in the main text, we start with an ansatz that has eleven terms. This difference in counting is due to imposing the first algebraic Bianchi identity, which provides eighteen constraints amongst the free coefficients ei(p2).\nD.2.2 Einstein gravity Weyl-Weyl two-point function\nHere we describe the calculation of the two-point function of the Weyl tensor in linearized gravity. This expression agrees with the current two-point function obtained in the main text up to local terms, as it must.\nThe Weyl tensor in linearized gravity is\nW\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = R\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u2212 2 d\u2212 2 ( \u03b7\u00b5[\u03c1R\u03c3]\u03bd \u2212 \u03b7\u03bd[\u03c1R\u03c3]\u00b5 ) + 2(d\u2212 1)(d\u2212 2)\u03b7\u00b5[\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3]\u03bdR . (D.14)\nUsing the expression for R\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 in terms of the metric h\u00b5\u03bd , which is given in (4.12), it is straightforward to obtain the expression for W\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 in terms of h\u00b5\u03bd . We can then use the linearized graviton propagator in de Donder gauge (see e.g. [115] for a derivation),\n\u3008h\u00b5\u03bd(p)h\u03b1\u03b2(\u2212p)\u3009 = 1 p2\n( \u03b7\u00b5\u03b1\u03b7\u03bd\u03b2 + \u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03b7\u00b5\u03b2 \u2212\n2 d\u2212 2\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03b1\u03b2\n) .

Interestingly, the contact terms are exactly those that allow us to write the two-point function in terms of a different projector:\n\u3008J\u00b51\u00b52|\u03bd1\u03bd2 \u2217K\u2217\u03b11\u03b12|\u03b21\u03b22\u3009 = d\u2212 3\n4(d\u2212 2)\n[ p2\u03a0(1|1)\u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd2\u03b11\u03b12\u03b21\u03b22 + contact terms ] , (D.17)\n= d\u2212 34(d\u2212 4)p 2\u03a0(2|2)\u00b51\u00b52\u03bd1\u03bd2\u03b11\u03b12\u03b21\u03b22 . (D.18)\nThe fact that the two-point function is exactly proportional to a projector \u2014 but that this is not the projector associated to the massless states in the spectral decomposition \u2014 is completely analogous to what happens for a superfluid and for electromagnetism.\nD.2.4 Parameter counting\nWe now describe all the different conditions that we can impose on the current-current two-point function. Here we slightly generalize the discussion in the main text, and allow for the currents J\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 and \u2217K\u2217\u00b5\u03bd|\u03b1\u03b2 to be only antisymmetric in their index pairs, without assuming that the \u00b5, \u03bd and \u03b1, \u03b2 are symmetric under interchange. We enumerate the possible conditions that we can impose exactly (even at coincident points) and also give the number of free coefficients ei(p2) that are left. In each case, we will write in parentheses the d = 4 case. In all cases, the number of free coefficients is fewer or equal in d = 4 to the number in generic dimension. This is a consequence of dimension-dependent identities that imply that some different solutions in generic dimension are degenerate in four dimensions.\nOne condition. Unsurprisingly, we can impose any of the four conditions we like. The parameter counting is as follows:\n\u2022 Tracelessness: this yields a 9 (6 in d = 4) parameter family of solutions.\n\u2022 Conservation: this yields a 6 (3 in d = 4) parameter family of solutions.\n\u2022 Dual conservation: this yields a 3 (3 in d = 4) parameter family of solutions.\nTwo conditions. Imposing two conditions further fixes the two-point function. The different cases are:\n\u2022 Conservation & dual conservation: this cannot be imposed.\n\u2022 Conservation & tracelessness: this yields a 3 (0 in d = 4) parameter family of solutions.\n\u2022 Dual conservation & tracelessness: this yields a 1 parameter family of solutions.\nIncluding the anomalous conditions completely fixes the correlator.\n\u2013 80 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 5 1\nD.2.5 Four dimensions\nIn four dimensions, the most we can simultaneously impose on the current is conservation.

We see that in the four-dimensional case, the conditions that we can impose on our two-point function are slightly different from the generic case. One can also check that the allowed possibilities are consistent with electric-magnetic duality in linearized gravity.\nOpen Access.
