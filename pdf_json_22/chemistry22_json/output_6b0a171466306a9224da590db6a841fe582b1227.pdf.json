    "abstractText": "Small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) are a class of therapeutic drugs that target protein kinases in diseases such as cancer. SMKIs are often designed to inhibit kinases involved in cell proliferation, but these drugs alter cell metabolism and the endocrine control of organismal metabolism. SMKI treatment in diabetic cancer patients reveals that certain SMKIs improve blood glucose levels and can mitigate insulin dependence or diabetic medication requirements in both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Certain SMKIs can preserve functional \u03b2-cell mass and increase insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity. It is not yet clear why different SMKIs can have opposing effects on insulin and blood glucose. Understanding the therapeutic effects of these drugs in T1D and T2D is complicated by overlapping off-target effects of SMKIs. The potency of inhibition of the intended protein kinase and inhibition of multiple off-target kinases may underpin conflicting reports of how certain SMKIs alter blood glucose and insulin. We summarize the effects of SMKIs on the intended and off-target kinases that can alter blood glucose and insulin, including c-Abl, c-Kit, EGFR, and VEGF. Inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 consistently lowers blood glucose in T1D and T2D. The effects of SMKIs on the kinases that regulate immune pathways, such as BTK and RIPKs, mediate many of the diverse effects of these drugs on metabolism. We highlight that inhibition of RIPK2 by SMKIs is a central node in metabolism that influences key metabolic pathways including lipolysis, blood glucose control, insulin secretion, and insulin resistance. Protein kinases and small molecule kinase inhibitors More than 500 protein kinases have been confirmed in the human genome, and these kinases regulate cellular signaling cascades that control fundamental cell function, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, metabolism, and immunity (Adams 2001, Manning et  al. 2002). Protein kinases regulate the biological activity of other proteins by transferring a \u03b3-phosphate group from an ATP molecule to a specific serine/threonine residue or a tyrosine residue on the substrate protein (Dhanasekaran & Premkumar Reddy 1998, Manning et  al. 2002). Given the critical role of protein kinases in regulating almost all cellular activities and functions, it follows that dysregulation of specific protein kinases is implicated in numerous disease states (Lahiry et al. 2010), and pharmacological inhibition of aberrant kinase activity is a promising drug target for disease treatment. The last 2 decades have seen a rapid and widespread use of more than 60 small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) approved for 2",

SMKIs are often designed to inhibit kinases involved in cell proliferation, but these drugs alter cell metabolism and the endocrine control of organismal metabolism. SMKI treatment in diabetic cancer patients reveals that certain SMKIs improve blood glucose levels and can mitigate insulin dependence or diabetic medication requirements in both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Certain SMKIs can preserve functional \u03b2-cell mass and increase insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity. It is not yet clear why different SMKIs can have opposing effects on insulin and blood glucose. Understanding the therapeutic effects of these drugs in T1D and T2D is complicated by overlapping off-target effects of SMKIs. The potency of inhibition of the intended protein kinase and inhibition of multiple off-target kinases may underpin conflicting reports of how certain SMKIs alter blood glucose and insulin. We summarize the effects of SMKIs on the intended and off-target kinases that can alter blood glucose and insulin, including c-Abl, c-Kit, EGFR, and VEGF. Inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 consistently lowers blood glucose in T1D and T2D. The effects of SMKIs on the kinases that regulate immune pathways, such as BTK and RIPKs, mediate many of the diverse effects of these drugs on metabolism. We highlight that inhibition of RIPK2 by SMKIs is a central node in metabolism that influences key metabolic pathways including lipolysis, blood glucose control, insulin secretion, and insulin resistance.\nProtein kinases and small molecule kinase inhibitors\nMore than 500 protein kinases have been confirmed in the human genome, and these kinases regulate cellular signaling cascades that control fundamental cell function, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, metabolism, and immunity (Adams 2001, Manning et\u00a0 al. 2002). Protein kinases regulate the biological activity of other proteins by transferring a \u03b3-phosphate group from an ATP molecule to a specific serine/threonine residue or a tyrosine residue on the substrate protein\n(Dhanasekaran & Premkumar Reddy 1998, Manning et\u00a0 al. 2002). Given the critical role of protein kinases in regulating almost all cellular activities and functions, it follows that dysregulation of specific protein kinases is implicated in numerous disease states (Lahiry et\u00a0al. 2010), and pharmacological inhibition of aberrant kinase activity is a promising drug target for disease treatment. The last 2 decades have seen a rapid and widespread use of more than 60 small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) approved for\nKey Words\nf glucose\nf insulin\nf diabetes\nf metabolism\nJournal of Endocrinology (2023) 256, e220212\nDownloaded from Bioscientifica.com at 01/25/2024 09:54:20PM via free access\nhttps://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-22-0212 https://joe.bioscientifica.com \u00a9 2023 Society for Endocrinology\nPublished by Bioscientifica Ltd.

Several of these agents have already been approved for use in several non-malignant conditions including dermatitis, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and graft versus host disease (Roskoski 2020). SMKIs are often used as adjuvants in chemotherapy, but theyare not cytotoxic agents. In general, SMKIs are well-tolerated and widely used. SMKIs in clinical settings have yielded extensive, pre-existing safety and side-effect profiles for many of these drugs (Roskoski 2020).\nKinase inhibitors function by blocking the transfer of the \u03b3-phosphate group from the ATP molecule, either by directly binding to the ATP-binding site (type I inhibitors) or by binding to an allosteric site of the kinase that prevents access to the ATP-binding site (type II\u2013IV inhibitors). Due to the similar 3D structure and highly conserved ATPbinding pocket across the entirety of the mammalian kinome, specificity issues and inhibition of off-target kinases are of major concern in the development and use of SMKIs. Despite their intended selectivity and specificity, clinically approved kinase inhibitors have many off-target effects and inhibit a range of kinases (Davis et\u00a0 al. 2011). The dose is a critical determinant of off-target effects of SMKIs. The effective (i.e. bioavailable) dose is influenced by the metabolism of SMKIs. Most kinase inhibitors are rapidly absorbed and reach peak plasma concentration within 3\u20137 h after an oral dose. Food consumption only marginally increases the extent of or does not significantly affect the bioavailability of most kinase inhibitors (van Erp et\u00a0 al. 2009). Kinase inhibitors are primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 with other CYP enzymes playing a secondary role in the metabolism of some inhibitors. Kinase inhibitors are predominantly excreted in feces, and a minor amount is also excreted in urine (van Erp et\u00a0al. 2009). The purpose of this review is to highlight how SMKIs that are often designed for cancer treatment can alter blood glucose and insulin. We apologize that not all relevant literature could be included in this review. We selected specific references and focused on literature that highlighted the connection between SMKIs and blood glucose and insulin and also uncovered the mechanisms of action linking metabolism and SMKIs in humans and in pre-clinical studies.\nSMKIs have opposing effects on glucose and insulin in type 1 and type 2 diabetes\nBoth T1D and T2D are diseases defined by elevated blood glucose levels. T1D is caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells, leading to inability to produce and secrete insulin to control blood glucose. In contrast, the early stages of prediabetes that occur before overt T2D are characterized by increased insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and close to normal blood glucose levels. Eventual decline in insulin production and continued insulin resistance equate to hyperglycemia in overt T2D. Despite the differences in the underlying pathophysiology of T1D and T2D, a significant number of clinical reports have demonstrated a decreased need for exogenous insulin or diabetic medications in both T1D and T2D cancer patients receiving SMKI therapy (Table 1). These initial clinical observations spurred interest in re-tasking clinically approved SMKIs for use in diabetes. The underlying mechanisms that mediate the glycemic effects of SMKIs have been studied in vitro and in various in vivo rodent models of T1D and T2D.\nThere is no unifying theory explaining how SMKIs alter blood glucose or insulin, and this is further complicated by conflicting reports of specific SMKIs promoting hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia in different patients or experiment models. For example, there are many reports of the SMKI dasatinib lowering blood glucose in T1D, T2D, and non-diabetic patients (Breccia et\u00a0 al. 2008, Agostino et\u00a0al. 2011, Ono et\u00a0al. 2012, Yu et\u00a0al. 2019, Lundholm & Charnogursky 2020, Salaami et\u00a0 al. 2021). Dasatinib was also reported to promote hyperglycemia in a cohort of non-diabetic patients and in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (Sylow et\u00a0 al. 2016, Yu et\u00a0 al. 2019). In contrast, hyperglycemia is one of the main doselimiting side-effects for some SMKIs, including nilotinib, rociletinib, and ceritinib, which has been attributed to impaired pancreatic \u03b2-cell insulin secretion, or inhibition of the insulin receptor (IR) and development of insulin resistance in human patients (Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation 2014, Zdenek et\u00a0 al. 2014, Sequist et\u00a0 al. 2015, Sakuma et\u00a0al. 2019). SMKIs have also been reported to have opposing effects on blood insulin levels. Some clinical reports demonstrate increased insulin or c-peptide levels during dasatinib, imatinib, sunitinib, and nilotinib therapy and increased \u03b2-cell insulin secretion in vitro, while conflicting reports in the literature suggest nilotinib can also impair insulin secretion in humans (Haap et\u00a0al. 2007,\nDownloaded from Bioscientifica.com at 01/25/2024 09:54:20PM via free access\nhttps://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-22-0212 https://joe.bioscientifica.com \u00a9 2023 Society for Endocrinology\nPublished by Bioscientifica Ltd.

A schematic summary of the main glycemic and insulinemic effects of some of the most widely used, clinically approved SMKIs is presented in Fig. 1.\nTargets regulating glycemic effects of SMKIs\nIt is difficult to ascertain the mechanism of action underlying the ability of a specific SMKIs to regulate blood glucose due to numerous off-target actions on multiple protein kinases. For example, imatinib is designed against, and is considered highly specific for, non-receptor\ntyrosine kinase abelson (c-Abl) kinase, but imatinib also inhibits numerous other kinases to a comparable degree, including c-Kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2). Common overlapping targets for many of the SMKIs that have reported effects on blood glucose and insulin dynamics include cAbl, c-Kit, receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), EGF receptor, ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1), PDGFR\u03b2, c-June N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), and the insulin receptor (InsR) (Fig. 2). A number of these SMKI targets has been implicated in metabolic homeostasis, but the key target kinases and molecular signals responsible for each specific SMKI\u2019s ability to cause changes in blood glucose or insulin are unknown and dependent on the effective dose. Using publicly available kinase inhibition assay data from the Harvard Medical School LINCS Center database, we have compiled a table describing many clinically approved SMKIs and their targets relevant to metabolism and the relative degree of inhibition (Table 2). The potential metabolic role of each of these target kinases is discussed in detail below.\nc-Abl\nExpressed in the majority of cells, c-Abl is a critical regulator of cell growth, motility, cytoskeleton dynamics,\nTable 1 Clinical evidence of KIs altering blood glucose or insulin in diabetic cancer patients.\nKinase inhibitor Summary of effects on blood glucose or insulin References\nBrigatinib \u2191 Hyperglycemia in human patients ARIAD Pharmaceuticals 2017 Ceritinib \u2191 Hyperglycemia in human non-diabetic and\nT2D patients Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation 2014, Khozin et\u00a0al. 2015,\nSakuma et\u00a0al. 2019, Miyoshi et\u00a0al. 2021 Dasatinib \u2193 Fasting blood glucose and \u2193 insulin in\nhuman T2D patients Breccia et\u00a0al. 2008, Agostino et\u00a0al. 2011, Ono et\u00a0al. 2012,\nLundholm & Charnogursky 2020, Salaami et\u00a0al. 2021 Erlotinib \u2193 Fasting blood glucose and \u2193 insulin in\nhuman T2D patients Costa & Huberman 2006, Brooks 2012\nImatinib \u2193 Fasting blood glucose and \u2193 insulin in human T1D and T2D diabetic patients\nBreccia et\u00a0al. 2004, Veneri et\u00a0al. 2005, Agostino et\u00a0al. 2011, Salaroli et\u00a0al. 2012\nNeratinib \u2193 Blood glucose in human T2D patient \u2193 Glycemia and \u2191 insulin secretion in mouse\nT1D model\nArdestani et\u00a0al. 2019, Angelis et\u00a0al. 2022\nNilotinib \u2191 Blood glucose and \u2191 insulin levels in human non-diabetic patients\nSaglio et\u00a0al. 2010, Zdenek et\u00a0al. 2014\n\u2191 Blood glucose and \u2193 insulin in human T2D patient\nIto et\u00a0al. 2013\nPazopanib \u2193 Blood glucose in human T2D patient B\u00f6hm et\u00a0al. 2010 Rociletinib \u2191 Blood glucose levels in human non-\ndiabetic and diabetic patients Sequist et\u00a0al. 2015\nSorafenib \u2193 Blood glucose levels in human nondiabetic and T2D patients\nAgostino et\u00a0al. 2011, Holstein et\u00a0al. 2013, Di Costanzo et\u00a0al. 2017\nSunitinib \u2193 Blood glucose and \u2193 insulin in human non-diabetic and T1D/T2D patients\nBillemont et\u00a0al. 2008, Templeton et\u00a0al. 2008, Agostino et\u00a0al. 2011, Oh\u00a0et\u00a0al. 2012, Chen et\u00a0al. 2013b, Demirci et\u00a0al. 2014, Huda et\u00a0al. 2014, Tyrrell & Pwint 2014\nFigure\u00a01 Summary of clinically approved SMKIs and the effects on blood glucose and insulin. *Denotes conflicting clinical and experimental effects.\nDownloaded from Bioscientifica.com at 01/25/2024 09:54:20PM via free access\nhttps://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-22-0212 https://joe.bioscientifica.com \u00a9 2023 Society for Endocrinology\nPublished by Bioscientifica Ltd.

The focus of c-Abl research has largely been in human cancers, including the oncogenic BCR-Abl fusion, which encodes a highly active kinase and contributes to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Hantschel & Superti-Furga 2004). Imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosubtinib, and ponatinib represent the main SMKIs developed against c-Abl/BCR-Abl for use in CML and ALL (Lindholm et\u00a0 al. 2016). Interestingly, c-Abl is highly expressed in the s.c. adipose tissue of obese humans and mice fed a high fat diet (HFD), and in vivo data suggest adipose tissue-specific deletion of c-Abl in HFD-fed mice mitigated weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia (Wu et\u00a0 al. 2017). Consistent with these reports of reduced HFD-induced weight gain, c-Abl has been implicated as a regulator of adipocyte differentiation via PPAR\u03b22 in in vitro studies (Keshet et\u00a0al. 2014). In contrast, in vitro work has shown that c-Abl is induced by high glucose levels; however, this can be reversed by c-Abl inhibition via administration of imatinib (Jia et\u00a0 al. 2008, Xia et\u00a0 al. 2014). The results are congruent with in vivo findings from our lab demonstrating that imatinib treatment in obese mice lowers hyperglycemia but induces hyperinsulinemia (Duggan et\u00a0al. 2020).\nImatinib is a potent inhibitor of c-Abl, and although other kinase targets of imatinib may mediate some of the effects on blood glucose and insulin, clinical reports of T1D and T2D and experimental models consistently show that imatinib lowers blood glucose but restores or enhances insulin production in both T1D and T2D (Breccia et\u00a0 al. 2004, Veneri et\u00a0al. 2005, Haap et\u00a0al. 2007, H\u00e4gerkvist et\u00a0al. 2007, Louvet et\u00a0 al. 2008, Han et\u00a0 al. 2009, Agostino et\u00a0 al.\n2011, Salaroli et\u00a0 al. 2012, Lau et\u00a0 al. 2014, Samaha et\u00a0 al. 2020, Pichavaram et\u00a0 al. 2021). Additionally, nilotinib is a similarly potent inhibitor of c-Abl, but there are contrasting reports on nilotinib\u2019s effects on blood glucose and insulin. Nilotinib has been reported to increase blood glucose in non-diabetic and T2D patients while increasing insulin levels in non-diabetic patients but decreasing insulin levels in T2D. Furthermore, in a rodent model of T1D, nilotinib preserved serum insulin levels while decreasing blood glucose (Saglio et\u00a0al. 2010, Ito et\u00a0al. 2013, Zdenek et\u00a0al. 2014, Samaha et\u00a0 al. 2019). This is further complicated by the fact both imatinib and nilotinib have a similar inhibition profile regarding kinases implicated in metabolic homeostasis, including c-Kit, PDGFR\u03b2, and JNK to various degrees (Fig. 2 or Table 2). An important study by Louvet et\u00a0 al. attempted to address the difficulty in interpreting SMKI\u2019s effects due to overlapping targets by using a systematic combination of SMKIs and neutralizing antibodies in a genetic rodent model of T1D. Imatinib prevented onset of and led to remission of T1D and modestly decreased leukocyte infiltration in pancreatic islets. Similar results were observed with sunitinb, which is primarily targeted against VEGFR, in the same model. The authors suggest that the efficacy of sunitinib eliminated a role for c-Abl in improving T1D; however, kinase assays demonstrate that sunitinib inhibits c-Abl to a significant degree, as well as c-Kit and PDGFR\u03b2 (Table 2). More convincingly, experiments using c-Kit monoclonal antibodies only resulted in a marginal effect on blood glucose, while delivery of a soluble form of PDGFR rapidly reversed T1D in these mice (Louvet et\u00a0 al. 2008). Due to the capability of both imatinib and sunitinib to inhibit PDGFR\u03b2, this strongly supports the concept that inhibiting\nFigure\u00a02 Summary of clinically approved SMKIs that alter blood glucose control and their numerous kinase targets.\nDownloaded from Bioscientifica.com at 01/25/2024 09:54:20PM via free access\nhttps://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-22-0212 https://joe.bioscientifica.com \u00a9 2023 Society for Endocrinology\nPublished by Bioscientifica Ltd.

However, this result does not rule out a role for c-Abl in the regulation of blood glucose and insulin secretion, which should be considered a next step in this line of research.\nPDGFR\u03b2\nPDGFR\u03b2 belongs to a family of membrane-bound receptors activated by platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), which control fundamental aspects of cell function, including growth and proliferation. PDGF-PDFR\u03b2 signaling regulates hematopoiesis, blood vessel formation, and wound repair (Chen et\u00a0 al. 2013a). Overactive PDGFR signaling has been implicated in proliferative diseases, including various cancers and atherosclerosis (Chen et\u00a0al. 2013a). PDGFRs have been reviewed elsewhere as cancer drug targets (Pietras et\u00a0al. 2003). Sunitinib and sorafenib are two of the main SMKIs that have been developed against PDGFR\u03b2, but these SMKIs also inhibit cKIT and fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) with equal or even greater potency, according to available kinase assay data (Levitzki 2004, Davis et\u00a0 al. 2011). Nonetheless, sunitinib and sorafenib consistently yield improvements in blood glucose level, lower blood glucose, and/or reductions in insulin requirements in T1D and T2D patients and rodent models (Billemont et\u00a0al. 2008, Louvet et\u00a0al. 2008, Templeton et\u00a0al. 2008, Agostino et\u00a0 al. 2011, Imarisio et\u00a0 al. 2012, Oh et\u00a0 al. 2012, Holstein et\u00a0 al. 2013, Mukai et\u00a0 al. 2014, Di Costanzo et\u00a0al. 2017, Peng et\u00a0al. 2018, Karbownik et\u00a0al. 2020, Mahdi et\u00a0al. 2022).\nPDGFR\u03b2 is increased in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of HFD-fed mice. Additionally, adipose-specific knockdown of Pdgfrb resulted in lower accumulation of visceral and s.c. fat and improved blood glucose control and lower blood insulin in HFD-fed mice, coincident with a reduction in new blood vessel formation in adipose tissue (Onogi et\u00a0 al. 2017, Shao et\u00a0 al. 2018). The effects of inhibiting PDGFR\u03b2 are not restricted to obesity and T2D, since Louvet et\u00a0 al. showed that targeting PDGFR\u03b2 can mitigate aspects of T1D in lean mice (Louvet et\u00a0 al. 2008). There is not much evidence that contradicts the concept of PDGF\u03b2 inhibition and lower blood glucose, but some work has implicated PDGF\u03b2 as a growth factor that stimulates insulin-independent glucose transport and glucose uptake in adipocytes (Whiteman et\u00a0al. 2003). In theory, this suggests that inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 could limit blood glucose disposal and increase blood glucose\nin models of insulin resistance or insufficiency. However, the impact of adipocyte glucose uptake on systemic blood glucose control is limited and any potential effect on adipocyte glucose uptake on blood glucose appears outweighed by the totality of SMKI evidence showing that inhibiting PDGF\u03b2 lowers blood glucose. It is not yet clear how targeting PDGFR\u03b2 participates in development of, or protection against, T1D and T2D despite the potential for reduced insulin-independent adipocyte glucose uptake."

Mutations leading to hyperactive EGFR or VEGFR have been associated with a number of cancers including types of lung and epithelial cancers, renal and thyroid cancers, and glioblastomas (Sullivan & Planchard 2016). Some of the first SMKIs approved for clinical use included the EGFR inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and numerous EGFR and VEGFR inhibitors have been approved in years since (Wu et\u00a0 al. 2015). EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib have been demonstrated to reverse hyperglycemia in clinical reports of T2D and improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in rodent models of T2D, while other EGFR-targeted inhibitors including panitumumab and rociletinib are associated with clinical hyperglycemia in human non-diabetic and T2D cancer patients (Costa & Huberman 2006, Brooks 2012, Zhang et\u00a0al. 2014, Goldman et\u00a0al. 2016, Li et\u00a0al. 2018, Duggan et\u00a0al. 2020). Although not approved for clinical use, another EGFR SMKI, dubbed PD153035, has been shown to reduce inflammation and improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice (Prada et\u00a0al. 2009). In this study and others, authors conclude that inhibition of EGFR contributes to the observed therapeutic effects; however, gefitinib, erlotinib, and PD153035 are not specific for EGFR. These SMKIs have been shown to inhibit many other kinases involved in glycemic control, including RIPK2, both in vitro and in vivo(Duggan et\u00a0 al. 2017). Increased expression and activity of EGF have been implicated in diabetes-induced vascular hypertrophy, nephropathy, and vasoconstriction relevant to cardiovascular disease outcomes, but it is unclear if and how EGF signaling may mediate blood glucose control (Gilbert et\u00a0 al. 2000, Chen et\u00a0 al. 2015, Prado et\u00a0 al. 2018). Current evidence is insufficient to determine specific kinase target(s) of EGFR SMKIs that are responsible for these contrasting effects on glycemic control.\nDownloaded from Bioscientifica.com at 01/25/2024 09:54:20PM via free access\nhttps://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-22-0212 https://joe.bioscientifica.com \u00a9 2023 Society for Endocrinology\nPublished by Bioscientifica Ltd.

However, these SMKIs also target c-Kit, c-Abl, and PDGFR\u03b2 and there is no clearly established role for VEGFR in blood glucose control. Furthermore, there are conflicting reports on the therapeutic benefits of altering VEGF signaling, and its contribution to angiogenesis during adipose tissue expansion (Tam et\u00a0 al. 2009, Robciuc et\u00a0 al. 2016). It remains unknown if off-target kinases are involved in the VEGF SMKI-mediated changes in blood glucose.\nc-KIT\nCD117, also known as c-Kit, is a transmembrane stem cell factor receptor expressed predominantly in bone marrow and progenitor cell populations. Gain-of-function mutations in c-Kit have been implicated in human hematopoietic and gastrointestinal cancers (Babaei et\u00a0 al. 2016). Imatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib are some of the most potent inhibitors of c-Kit with blood glucoselowering effects (Babaei et\u00a0 al. 2016). c-Kit expression has been found to be increased in the synovium of patients with obesity-associated osteoarthritis (Uchida et\u00a0al. 2019). Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia or HFDinduced obesity in rodents is associated with a decrease in the number of c-Kit+ bone marrow progenitor cells (Pierpaoli et\u00a0al. 2016, Van Den Berg et\u00a0al. 2016). However, specific inhibition of c-Kit using a monoclonal antibody approach did not affect the development or disease progression in a STZ-induced T1D rodent model, whereas the SMKIs imatinib and sunitinib protected against T1D development (Louvet et\u00a0 al. 2008). This suggests that although imatinib and sunitinib are designed to inhibit c-Kit, the actions of these SMKIs are propagated through other kinases that alter glycemic outcomes, although there is a current lack of convincing evidence identifying the specific kinase(s) and specific mechanism(s) underlying the distinct effects on blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, and \u03b2-cell function (Louvet et\u00a0 al. 2008). Multiple studies have identified that c-Kit is required for pancreatic \u03b2-cell\ngrowth and function, where decreased expression of c-Kit in mutant mouse models results in hyperglycemia and impaired glucose control. These manifestations have been observed as decreased insulin gene expression, \u03b2-cell mass, and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo and in isolated islets. (Krishnamurthy et\u00a0 al. 2007, Feng et\u00a0al. 2015). Thus, inhibition of c-Kit by SMKIs may be deleterious to glycemic control and limit their therapeutic benefits in T1D and T2D."

Our lab and others have defined the innate immune sensors NOD1 and NOD2 as points of convergence between immunity and blood glucose control in mice models. Specifically, activation of NOD1 triggers key features of metabolic syndrome, including lipolysis, inflammation, and dysglycemia. In contrast, activation of NOD2 alleviates metabolic dysfunction and improves blood glucose control during low-dose endotoxin or diet-induced obesity (Schertzer et\u00a0al. 2011, Chi et\u00a0al. 2014, Cavallari et\u00a0al. 2017, 2020, Duggan et\u00a0al. 2017). Consistent with this, deletion of hematopoietic NOD1 during obesity improves blood glucose control, whereas deletion of NOD2 during obesity worsens blood glucose control (Schertzer et\u00a0 al. 2011, Denou et\u00a0 al. 2015, Chan et\u00a0al. 2017).\nPropagation of NOD1 and NOD2 signaling requires the kinase activity of the downstream adaptor protein, RIPK2.

RIPK2 deletion results in exacerbated obesity and worsened insulin resistance during HFD-feeding in mice (Wang et\u00a0al. 2013a), although the relative importance of NOD1-RIPK2 vs NOD2-RIPK2 metabolism during obesity and their individual contributions to glycemic control in metabolic disease states are not well-understood. Since many SMKIs are potent inhibitors of RIPK2, including gefitinib and erlotinib, RIPK2 was positioned as a potential mediator of SMKI effects on blood glucose. Although RIPK2 is not the intended target, many SMKIs with reported inhibitory activity against RIPK2 (Table 2) can attenuate the glycemic consequences of acute NOD1 and NOD2 signaling (Duggan et\u00a0al. 2017, 2020). Thus, in the context of obesity, inhibition of the NOD1\u2013RIPK2 axis represented a potential mechanism by which SMKIs lower blood glucose. In contrast, inhibition of the NOD2-RIPK2 axis by SMKIs could limit the therapeutic benefits of these drugs on blood glucose. Using a series of genetic knockout mice models, we showed that gefitinib-mediated blood glucose lowering during obesity was entirely independent of NOD1, NOD2, or RIPK2 signaling. Importantly, we found that gefitinib treatment also lowered plasma insulin during a glucose challenge and improved insulin resistance only in Ripk2\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that deletion of Ripk2 improves the insulin sensitizing effect of gefitinib during obesity. These findings highlight that inhibition of RIPK2 by SMKIs may be limiting their therapeutic potential to not only lower blood glucose but improve insulin sensitivity in obesity and T2D (Duggan et\u00a0al. 2020) (Fig. 3)."

            "text": "RIPK1 and RIPK3 regulate immune, cellular stress, and cell survival responses. These kinases also work to mediate cell\napoptosis and necroptosis, which primarily engage RIPK3 (Wegner et\u00a0 al. 2017). Sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, ponatinib, and dabrafenib are all potent inhibitors of RIPK1 and/or RIPK3 and are being investigated for therapeutic repurposing in various inflammatory conditions. Interestingly, emerging evidence connects RIPK1 and RIPK3 to glucose homeostasis and metabolic disease. Overexpressing variants of the Ripk1 gene are associated with obesity in humans, and Ripk1 silencing in mice fed a HFD results in decreased body weight, adiposity, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced markers of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Karunakaran et\u00a0 al. 2020, Tao et\u00a0 al. 2021). This evidence positions RIPK1 as a potential therapeutic target for obesity-associated metabolic disease and as a potential mechanism underlying the blood glucose-altering effects of some SMKIs. Similarly, Ripk3 is overexpressed in the adipose tissue of obese mice and humans, and hepatic Ripk3 expression is correlated with the severity of fatty liver disease. In contrast to RIPK1, genetic knockdown of Ripk3 exacerbates inflammation and glucose intolerance during HFD-feeding (Gautheron et\u00a0al. 2016, Afonso et\u00a0al. 2021). A recent study established a role for RIPK3 in mediating IL-1\u03b2-dependent macrophage infiltration and \u03b2-cell dysfunction in response to ER stress or overnutrition, and inhibition of RIPK3 protected against islet inflammation and \u03b2-cell dysfunction in mouse pancreatic \u03b2-cell line (Yang et\u00a0 al. 2020). While current available evidence suggests that RIPK1 may be a therapeutic target of SMKIs that can contribute to improvements in glycemic control, there is conflicting evidence for the role of RIPK3 in protecting against inflammation and glucose tolerance during obesity versus precipitating \u03b2-cell inflammation and potential insulin secretion defects. Therefore, the role of RIPK3 in mediating SMKI\u2019s effects on blood glucose and insulin remains unclear. Given that RIPK1 and RIPK3 have emerged as regulators of metabolism,\nFigure\u00a03 SMKIs for RIPK2 attenuate acute NOD1 and NOD2 glycemic consequences, but inhibition of RIPK2 limits the insulin sensitizing potential of a SMKI during obesity.\nDownloaded from Bioscientifica.com at 01/25/2024 09:54:20PM via free access\nhttps://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-22-0212 https://joe.bioscientifica.com \u00a9 2023 Society for Endocrinology\nPublished by Bioscientifica Ltd.

            "text": "BTK was initially discovered as the genetic cause of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a condition characterized by defective development of B cells resulting in impaired immunoglobulin production (Vetrie et\u00a0 al. 1993). This non-receptor tyrosine kinase is crucial for the activation of B cells and other cells of the hematopoietic system (Liu et\u00a0 al. 2017). BTK influences proliferation, differentiation, and survival of B-cells, which makes this kinase a prime treatment target in many B-cell malignancies (Weber et\u00a0 al. 2017, Pal Singh et\u00a0 al. 2018). BTK has also been implicated in the activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, demonstrating a role for BTK in mediating both innate and adaptive immunity (Weber et\u00a0 al. 2017). Ibrutinib and acalabrutinib represent the two main FDA-approved SMKIs for BTK, used in the treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), among several other malignancies (Byrd et\u00a0 al. 2013, Wang et\u00a0 al. 2013b). Ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are designed to bind Cysteine-481 on BTK; however, off-target binding of several\nother homologous cysteine-containing kinases, such as the TEC family kinases (ITK, BMX, TEC), EGFR, T-cell X chromosome kinase (TXK), and Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), has been reported, which can lead to adverse side-effects (Honigberg et\u00a0al. 2010, Byrd et\u00a0al. 2016, Herman et\u00a0al. 2017). Although data are not available for acalabrutinib, kinase assay data for ibrutinib indicate that it inhibits RIPK2, EGFR, and c-ABL to a similar degree as BTK and ibrutinib is approximately half as potent for inhibition of c-Kit and PDGFR\u03b2 targets (Table 2).\nBeyond cancer treatment, studies investigating the deficiency or inhibition of BTK have demonstrated therapeutic potential in numerous inflammatory disease models like autoimmune arthritis, ischemic brain injury, and colitis, among others (Chang et\u00a0al. 2011, Ito et\u00a0al. 2015, Mao et\u00a0 al. 2020). The idea of BTK as a point of regulation for NLRP3-associated inflammation has gained traction in recent years (Liu et\u00a0al. 2017, Purvis et\u00a0al. 2020, Bittner et\u00a0al. 2021). The NLRP3 inflammasome mediates the activation and production of several inflammatory cytokines, which can exacerbate insulin resistance, and NLRP3-mediated IL-1\u03b2 activation contributes significantly to the development of obesity and T2D (Xu et\u00a0al. 2003, Zhao et\u00a0al. 2014). Ibrutinib treatment impairs activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby lowering IL-1\u03b2 processing and release in human primary macrophages and tumor-associated macrophages\nFigure\u00a04 SMKIs alter insulin production, insulin sensitivity, and blood glucose control through multiple kinases.\nDownloaded from Bioscientifica.com at 01/25/2024 09:54:20PM via free access\nhttps://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-22-0212 https://joe.bioscientifica.com \u00a9 2023 Society for Endocrinology\nPublished by Bioscientifica Ltd. Printed in Great Britain\nB Duggan et\u00a0al. 256:2Journal of Endocrinology\ne220212\n(Liu et\u00a0 al. 2017, Benner et\u00a0 al. 2019, Purvis et\u00a0 al. 2020). A recent study demonstrated that BTK is highly expressed in visceral adipose tissue samples collected from obese and diabetic human subjects and a positive correlation has been established between BTK gene expression and proinflammatory IL-1 expression in these samples. By targeting BTK via inhibition with ibrutinib, improvement in insulin resistance and increase in glucose uptake were observed in a human liver cancer cell line (Althubiti et\u00a0al. 2020).\nConsistent with this, HFD-feeding in mice has been shown to increase BTK expression and activation in liver, and treatment of HFD-fed mice with ibrutinib led to significantly lower levels of plasma insulin and non-fasting blood glucose and an improvement in insulin signaling in liver (Purvis et\u00a0 al. 2020). As newer generation inhibitors, little to no clinical reports of ibrutinib or acalabrutinib lowering blood glucose in diabetic cancer patients exist, but in vitro and rodent models support a role for targeting BTK to improve glycemic control in the context of metabolic disease, although inhibition of BTK versus other clinically relevant kinase targets (RIPK2, c-ABL, c-Kit, PDGFR\u03b2) must also be considered as an underlying mechanism of action."

            "text": "Understanding how specific SMKIs can alter blood glucose, insulin, and insulin sensitivity is important for both safe and effective use of SMKIs in their primary therapeutic indications, such as cancer or inflammatory disease. In addition to concerns of SMKI-induced acute hypoglycemia, higher blood glucose can affect the disease course of cancer and inflammatory conditions, and therefore, it is important to understand which SMKIs alter blood glucose and insulin and which kinase targets mediate these effects. The effects of SMKIs on blood glucose and insulin are complex, depend on the effective dose, and are complicated by the multiple kinases inhibited by a given SMKI (Fig. 4). It is important to distinguish between studies that use inhibitors to test the role of a given kinase versus genetic deletion of the target kinase, and ideally, genetic knockout models can be used to validate the proposed target kinase that is mediating the effects of a given SMKI effect. In addition, SMKI drugs in development include inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB)/AKT, which are critical nodes in insulin signaling pathways, where some potential signaling redundancies could be exploited (Liu et\u00a0al. 2009, Molinaro et\u00a0al. 2019). How these new SMKIs impact glycemic control\nand insulin dynamics will need to be carefully considered. An important future goal will be to assess the potential synergy between inhibiting multiple kinases, which occurs with each SMKI, as well as how SMKIs impact the host\u2013 microbe relationship, which can have important outcomes in cancer and diabetes progression and therapy."
