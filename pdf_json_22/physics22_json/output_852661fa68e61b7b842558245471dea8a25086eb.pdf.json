    "abstractText": "In heavy-ion fusion reactions, the enhancement in the sub-barrier fusion cross-section has been observed as compared to the 1-Dimensional barrier penetration model due to the coupling of many degrees of freedom to the relative motion. This enhancement can be explained theoretically by including nuclear structure effects like deformation and the coupling of relative motion among two colliding nuclei. The present work aims to investigate the effect of individual rotational energy levels on the fusion cross-sections for O-based reaction systems, namely, O + W, O + Hf, O + Yb, O + Er, O + Sm, O + Nd at energies below the fusion barrier. Using the CCFULL code, the effect of low-lying rotational energy levels on the fusion cross-section for O induced reactions has been investigated at energies below and around the Coulomb barrier. The calculations are performed by assuming the fixed value of diffuseness parameter a0 = 0.65 fm in the Woods-Saxon nuclear potential and the other two parameters are optimised by fitting the experimental data at the above barrier. Here we have determined the V0 and r0 as a function of ZPZT , where experimental cross-sections are available. From our calculations, it is observed that the hexadecapole deformation (\u03b24) with different magnitudes has a significant influence on the fusion cross sections. For the case of the +ve value of \u03b24, beyond 10 , the rotational levels cease to contribute significantly and also there is a significant difference between the contribution of sequential channels. On the other hand, in the case of -ve \u03b24, up to 6 + levels contribute significantly. Furthermore, we have established an algebraic systematic of fitting, which one can use to determine the parameters V0, r0 of Woods-Saxon nuclear potential within the range of ZPZT lie in between 480 \u2264 ZPZT \u2264 592. ar X iv :2 30 1. 04 36 3v 2 [ nu cl -t h] 2 0 A pr 2 02 3",

This enhancement can be explained theoretically by including nuclear structure effects like deformation and the coupling of relative motion among two colliding nuclei. The present work aims to investigate the effect of individual rotational energy levels on the fusion cross-sections for 16O-based reaction systems, namely, 16O + 182,184,186W, 16O + 176,180Hf, 16O + 174,176Yb, 16O + 166Er, 16O + 148,152,154Sm, 16O + 150Nd at energies below the fusion barrier. Using the CCFULL code, the effect of low-lying rotational energy levels on the fusion cross-section for 16O induced reactions has been investigated at energies below and around the Coulomb barrier. The calculations are performed by assuming the fixed value of diffuseness parameter a0 = 0.65 fm in the Woods-Saxon nuclear potential and the other two parameters are optimised by fitting the experimental data at the above barrier. Here we have determined the V0 and r0 as a function of ZPZT , where experimental cross-sections are available. From our calculations, it is observed that the hexadecapole deformation (\u03b24) with different magnitudes has a significant influence on the fusion cross sections. For the case of the +ve value of \u03b24, beyond 10 +, the rotational levels cease to contribute significantly and also there is a significant difference between the contribution of sequential channels. On the other hand, in the case of -ve \u03b24, up to 6 + levels contribute significantly. Furthermore, we have established an algebraic systematic of fitting, which one can use to determine the parameters V0, r0 of Woods-Saxon nuclear potential within the range of ZPZT lie in between 480 \u2264 ZPZT \u2264 592. ar X iv :2 30 1. 04 36 3v 2 [ nu\ncl -t"

            "text": "Over the last few decades, various theoretical and experimental efforts have been centred\non exploring the role of nuclear structure in the reaction dynamics [1, 2, 3]. During\nthe fusion process, the collision of an incident projectile and a target may lead to the\nformation of a compound nucleus through a quantum tunnelling process across the\nfusion barrier [1, 4, 5, 6]. Heavy-ion fusion reactions are accomplished in the crucial role\nof extending the nuclear chart and synthesizing the heavy elements. Furthermore, some\nheavy-ion fusion processes in lighter mass systems are pivotal to the reaction channels\nthat govern the elemental synthesis in stellar environments and energy production\n[2, 3, 7]. Experimentally, it has been observed that there is a large enhancement in the\nsub-barrier fusion cross-sections by considering the one-dimensional barrier penetration\nmodel [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] using bare nucleon-nucleon potentials. Such sub-barrier\nfusion enhancement could be elucidated by the coupling of relative motion degrees of\nfreedom with the internal degrees of freedom such as static deformations (rotational\nnuclei) [9, 10], vibrational effect in the nuclear surface (spherical nuclei) [14, 15, 16], and\nthe neck formation [17]. However, the effects of nucleon transfer on fusion below the\nbarrier have not yet been completely separated [6, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].\nSeveral works [1, 14, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34] have discussed the coupling between\nthe rotational state of the target nuclei. The internal degrees of freedom coupled with\nthe relative motion of colliding nuclei lowers the barrier. The significant decrease in\nthe fusion cross-section with respect to the experimental data, at energies below the\nCoulomb barrier, is also known as fusion hindrance [4]. A certain amount of flux allows\nthe projectile to tunnel through the fusion barrier and fuse well into the target [1, 8]\nmainly at below barrier energies. Therefore, coupled-channel calculations become a\nbenchmark theoretical tool to understand fusion reaction dynamics.\nNuclear fusion is a complicated phenomenon because of the involvement of many\nnucleons. Therefore, it is tedious to handle the interaction potential between two\ncolliding nuclei, which play a key role in describing the fusion reaction dynamics. In\ngeneral, the interaction potential comprises long-range repulsive Coulomb potential,\ncentrifugal interaction, and short-range attractive nuclear potential terms. Unlike\nCoulomb and centrifugal potentials, the nuclear potential is not well established till\nnow. In the past few decades, various efforts have been made to provide a simple and\naccurate form of the nuclear interaction potential [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Several\nfits of the nuclear potentials exist in the literature [42, 43, 44, 45, 46] which either\nkept the coupling off and/or included in the Woods-Saxon form while using the other\npotentials. The traditional Woods-Saxon potential has been prominent and widely used\nto probe the heavy-ion nuclear fusion dynamics [28, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53]. The\nWoods-Saxon potential consists of three parameters namely; potential depth, range\nand diffuseness parameter. The diffuseness parameter is an essential component in\nthe parameterization of Woods-Saxon nuclear potential, as it describes the slopes of\nthe potential in the tail region, where fusion begins [54]. Remarkably, the small value\nof the diffuseness parameter a0 = 0.65fm is most suitable for a good description of experimental data [12, 55] in the elastic scattering analysis while the large values of\nthe diffuseness parameter ranging from a = 0.75 to 1.5 fm provide the best fit for\nseveral excitation functions in the above barrier region to explore the experimental\ndata [4, 5, 12, 55, 56]. As a result, the Woods-Saxon nuclear potential parameters are\nemployed to study the elastic scattering and heavy-ion fusion processes in the Coupled\nchannel approach (CCFULL), which provides a good description of below barrier fusion\n[55, 56].\nIt is known that the nuclear reactions are adequately affected by the entrance\nchannel parameters and the internal structure such as mass asymmetry, deformation,\nand orientation of the colliding nuclei [57, 58, 59, 60], which are remarkably governed\nto influence the anticipation of a compound nucleus system. The significance of\nshape degrees of freedom in sub-barrier fusion enhancement has been investigated\nexperimentally using the fusion of two colliding nuclei [61]. As we know, CCFULL is\none of the computational codes used to explore fusion dynamics, where a full description\nof the Woods-Saxon nuclear potential parameters (V0, r0 and a0) for colliding nuclei is essential. To understand the nuclear interaction potential for a recently synthesized or anticipated target nuclei for 16O- induced reactions, one must fit the main ingredient\nparameters for the nuclear potential as per the shape degrees of freedom. We will also\nintroduce an algebraic fitting of V0 and r0 by using the available known data. This will be crucial for the theoretical calculations in predicting the fusion characteristics of\ncompound nuclei, which is an essential input for the upcoming experiments.\nFurthermore, the study will include the significant role of each rotational energy\nlevel (i.e. 2+, 4+, 6+, 8+, 10+ and 12+) in the enhancement of the fusion cross-\nsection mainly at energies below the Coulomb barrier for spherical and deformed nuclei. Here, the fusion cross-section of 12 different 16O- induced reactions with rotational target nuclei i.e., 16O+182,184,186W, 176,180Hf, 174,176Yb, 166Er, 148,152,154Sm, 150Nd will be\nanalyzed at sub-barrier energies within the static Woods-Saxon potential with standard diffuseness parameter a0 = 0.65 fm. We have considered 16O as spherical [61, 62, 63] to investigate the effect of the individual rotational energy level of target nuclei on the\nfusion cross-section. It is worth mentioning that the low-lying rotational energy levels for the chosen target nuclei follow the sequence of state with I = 0+, 2+, 4+, 6+, etc and the excitation energies of I+ state is proportional to I(I+1)\u2217E2T/6 [64]. Moreover, a better channel selection has been made for different signs of \u03b2-values [33, 59, 60, 65, 66] for\nindividual energy levels. In addition, a comparison will be made between the resulting\ntheoretical results and the available experimental data for the nuclear reactions under\nconsideration.\nThis paper is organized as follows: A brief description of the theoretical formalism used\nin this work is given in Section 2. The results of the coupled channel calculations are\ngiven in detail in Section 3. Section 4 summarizes and concludes this work."

            "text": "This section provides a brief description of Coupled Channel approach (CCFULL) used\nin the present study, which provides a reasonable understanding of the nuclear fusion\ndynamics at energies around the barrier. Within this approach, multidimensional barrier\npenetration is considered instead of single barrier penetration. This method is used\nunder the effect of coupling of the relative motion with the intrinsic degrees of freedom\nof the interacting nuclei [4, 34, 67], mainly for the calculation of mean angular momenta\nand the fusion cross-sections of the compound nucleus. The traditional method for\naddressing the effects of the coupling between relative motion and intrinsic degrees of\nfreedom on fusion is to numerically solve the coupled-channels equations, which includes\nall relevant channels [68, 69]. The CC equations solve numerically within the Coupled channel approach are given as,[ \u2212~2\n2\u00b5\nd2 dr2 + J(J + 1)~2 2\u00b5r2 + ZPZT e 2 r + VN + n \u2212 Ec.m. ] \u00d7 \u03c8n(r) +\n\u2211 m Vnm(r)\u03c8m(r) = 0. (1)\nHere r defines the radial part of relative motion between the participating nuclei and\n\u00b5 is known as the reduced mass of the colliding system. n is the excitation energy for the nth channel and Ec.m. is the bombarding energy in the centre of the mass frame. VN represents the nuclear potential and Vnm symbolizes the matrix elements of the coupled Hamiltonian. Since there are several Coupled channel equations, their dimension is\nalso large. Thus, the rotating frame approximation or no-Coriolis approximation is\nemployed to reduce the dimension of Coupled channel equations [34, 67, 70, 71]. The\nCC equations with non-linear coupling are significant in studying the heavy-ion fusion\nreactions mainly at sub-barrier energies. All these sets of non-linear coupling are taken\ninto account.\nThe incoming wave boundary conditions (IWBC) [72] are also essential for the\nsolution of Coupled channel equation because IWBC or ingoing wave conditions are\nquite sensitive for the potential pocket of the interaction fusion barrier. The incoming\nwave of the entrance channel is present inside the barrier at the minimum position (r\n= rmin) and the outgoing wave of other channels are present at an infinite position. By including the effect of the dominant intrinsic channels, the fusion cross-sections are\ncalculated as given below:\n\u03c3J(E) = \u03c3fus(E) = \u03c0\nk20 \u2211 J (2J + 1)PJ(E). (2)\nHere, the total angular momentum \u2018J\u2019 is substituted in place of \u2018`\u2019 for each channel by\napplying iso-centrifugal approximation by using the following equation:\n\u3008`\u3009 = \u2211 J J\u03c3J(E)/ \u2211 J \u03c3J(E) =\n( \u03c0\nk20 \u2211 J J(2J + 1)PJ(E) ) /(\n\u03c0\nk20 \u2211 J (2J + 1)PJ(E)\n) , (3)\nwhere PJ(E) is the total transmission coefficient. The Woods-Saxon form of nuclear potential is used to analyze the nuclear structure effects [34, 67, 70, 71] and it is defined\nas\nVN = \u2212V0 1 + exp [( r0 \u2212R0 ) /a0 ] , (4) where V0, r0, and a0 are the nuclear potential parameter.\nIn the Coupled channel approach, the rotational coupling with a pure rotor is taken\ninto consideration. One can generate the nuclear coupling Hamiltonian by changing the\ntarget radius in the nuclear potential to a dynamical operator,\nR0 \u2192 R0 + O\u0302 = R0 + \u03b22RTY20 + \u03b24RTY40. (5)\nHere RT is rcoupA 1/3 and \u03b22 and \u03b24 are the quadrupole and hexadecapole deformation parameters of the deformed target nucleus, respectively. Thus, the nuclear coupling\nHamiltonian is given by\nVN(r, O\u0302) = \u2212V0 1 + exp [( r0 \u2212R0 \u2212 O\u0302 ) /a0 ] , (6) To connect the |n\u3009 = |I0\u3009 and |m\u3009 = |I \u20320\u3009 states of the target\u2019s ground rotational band, we need matrix elements of the coupling Hamiltonian. These are readily accessible using\nmatrix algebra [73]. In this algebra, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator O\u0302,\nwhich satisfies\nO\u0302 | \u03b1 >= \u03bb\u03b1 | \u03b1 > (7)\nThis is implemented in the CCFULL program by diagonalizing the matrix O\u0302, whose\nelements are given by\nO\u0302II\u2032 =\n\u221a 5(2I + 1)(2I \u2032 + 1)\n4\u03c0 \u03b22RT\n( I 2 I \u2032\n0 0 0\n)2\n+\n\u221a 9(2I + 1)(2I \u2032 + 1)\n4\u03c0 \u03b24RT\n( I 4 I \u2032\n0 0 0\n)2 .\n(8)\nThe nuclear coupling matrix elements are then evaluated as\nV (N)nm = < I0 | VN(r, O\u0302) | I \u2032 0 > \u2212V (0)N (r)\u03b4n,m, = \u2211 \u03b1 < I0 | \u03b1 >< \u03b1 | I \u20320 > VN(r, \u03bb\u03b1)\u2212 V (0)N (r)\u03b4n,m. (9)\nThe last term is included in the equation to avoid the diagonal component from being\ncounted twice. The linear rotational coupling approximation is used to calculate the\nCoulomb matrix and explained as\nV CR(I,I\u2032) = 3ZPZTR\n2 T\n5r3\n\u221a 5(2I + 1)(2I \u2032 + 1)\n4\u03c0 \u00d7(\n\u03b22 + 2\n7 \u03b222\n\u221a 5\n\u03c0\n)( I 2 I \u2032\n0 0 0\n)2\n+ 3ZPZTR\n4 T\n9r5\n\u221a 9(2I + 1)(2I \u2032 + 1)\n4\u03c0 \u00d7(\n\u03b24 + 9\n7 \u03b222\n)( I 4 I \u2032\n0 0 0\n) ,\n(10)\nfor rotational coupling.

Various theoretical approaches have been\ndeveloped to generate the attractive nuclear potential for the description of fusion data\nover wide energy ranges [76, 77, 78]. In this work, Woods-Saxon parameterization has\nbeen taken into account to compute the interaction potential. The standard value of\ndiffuseness parameter a0 = 0.65 fm is used for the considered nuclear reactions [12, 55]. The deformation parameter \u03b2\u03bb connected with the transition of multipolarity \u03bb were\ndetermined from experimental transition probabilities B(E2) by using the following\nrelation:\n\u03b2\u03bb = 4\u03c0\n3ZR\u03bb\n\u221a B(E\u03bb) \u2191\ne2 , (11)\nwhere R = 1.2A1/3fm, and B(E\u03bb) \u2191 is in units of e2b2. For \u03bb = 2, the values of B(E2) \u2191 [74] are experimental and independent of nuclear models. On the other hand, the parameter \u03b2\u03bb depends upon the nuclear model and determines the calculation of deformation parameter.\nIn the present study, we aim to understand the effect of each rotational energy\nlevel up to 12+ levels i.e., 2+, 4+, 6+, 8+, 10+ and 12+ in the enhancement of the\nfusion cross-sections at below barrier energies. The calculations for the fusion crosssections have been exercised in steps (increment of 2+ state in each step) from 0+ to 12+ channels. Nonetheless, we observed that for negative and positive \u03b24 values, beyond 6 + and 10+ respectively, the higher-order channels cease to contribute significantly towards\nthe fusion cross-section around and below the Coulomb barrier. Further, two different\nconditions based on the shape of nuclei: (1) \u03b24 < 0, and (2) \u03b24 > 0 are considered. The quadrupole (\u03b22) and/or hexadecapole (\u03b24) deformations of deformed nuclei are generally taken into account while characterizing the rotation of the nuclei. It has been suggested\nthat the reactions containing nuclei with \u03b24 show an enhancement in the fusion crosssection at energies below the barrier [59, 79]. Our present calculations assume the 16O\n(projectile) as spherical [59, 61, 62, 63, 80, 81] to determine the rotational effect of the\ntarget nucleus on fusion cross-section effectively. It is important to note here that the\nnucleon transfer channels are not considered in the present calculations, which may play\na significant role at energies below the Coulomb barrier [18, 19, 20]."

            "text": "The near barrier and sub-barrier fusion cross-sections for 16O+182,184,186W, 176,180Hf, 174,176Yb systems have been analyzed systematically by employing CCFULL code us-\ning the static Woods-Saxon potential with \u03b22 > 0, \u03b24 < 0 of the target nuclei. The Woods-Saxon parameterizations of Akyu\u0308z-Winther potential (AW), the values of the\ndeformation parameters (\u03b22, \u03b24) and the excitation energy corresponding to the first excitation state are given in Table 1. The values of the Woods-Saxon potential param-\neters (V0, r0 & a0) are chosen to fit the experimental fusion cross-section at the above barrier energies for the case of the 1-D barrier penetration model. The variation of the total interaction potential at ` = 0~ with the separation distance \u2018r\u2019 for these systems is also shown in Fig. 1. Here the total interaction potential is the sum of Woods-Saxon potential in Eq. (4), and the Coulomb potential VC= ZPZT e 2\nr . From the figure, one can\nnotice that the pocket formed for 16O+180Hf reaction is much deeper in comparison to\nthe others, which may result in a larger fusion probability.\nThe fusion cross-sections have been calculated using a 1D barrier penetration model for\nthese reactions. The one-dimensional barrier penetration data is represented by a solid\nblack line as shown in Fig. 2. From the figure, we found the obtained results under-\nestimate the experimental data, especially at low barrier energies. In order to address\nthe fusion cross-section of the above-mentioned reactions, rotational degrees of freedom\nhave been included in the CCFULL calculations. Only the quadrupole deformation (\u03b22) is initially considered, and the calculations are performed along with various values of\n\u03b22 ranging from 0.221 to 0.324. The deformation parameters used in these reactions decreases as the mass number increases. Up to 12+ channels are incorporated in each\nsystem to observe the effect of each rotational level in the enhancement of the fusion\ncross-section and/or to predict the number of channels that are good enough to converge\nto the experimental data and beyond it the higher order ceases to contribute. Within\nthe addition of rotational channels corresponding to these levels, the enhancement in\nthe fusion cross-sections has been observed as compared to the single barrier penetration\ncase. The contribution of the rotational energy levels on the fusion cross-section up to 6+ state has been found to be significant. It has been observed that the ground state\nquadrupole deformation alone is unable to reproduce the experimental data across the\nbelow barrier energy region.\nTo address these issues, the hexadecapole deformation (\u03b24) is included in the CC calculations, as illustrated in Fig 3. The estimated results using 1-D BPM are comparatively\nlower than the experimental data. The coupled channel computations are performed for this system including rotational energy levels up to the 12+ state of the target nuclei. A significant change in the fusion cross-section is observed for 0+ to 2+ state as compared to the 1-D BPM, and a small change for 2+ to 6+ states. Furthermore, we observe that the cross-section with the inclusion of higher-order channels, beyond 6+, overlaps with that of up to the 6+ state. The fusion cross-section for 16O + 182,184,186W reactions\nare calculated with the \u03b24 values ranging from -0.066 to -0.095. The calculated results\nare shown in Fig. 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), and the experimental data [79, 82] are given for comparison. The theoretical results of CC calculations with 6+ channels enhance the fusion cross-section more in comparison to the 1-D BPM for 16O + 182W reaction, as\nrepresented in the Fig. 3(a). There is substantial variation in the \u03b24 value as the mass number increases from 182W to 184W i.e. the difference between their \u03b24 values is 0.027. As a result, there is slight change in the cross-section as we move from 2+ to 6+ channels\nat -0.093 and -0.095 values of the \u03b24 parameter, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b) and 3(c). For the above barrier energies, the calculated cross-section is a reasonably good match with\nthe experimental data [79, 82]. Similar observation can be pointed out for the case of 16O+176Hf and 16O+180Hf, where\nthe \u03b24 values are -0.057 and -0.068, respectively. As demonstrated in Fig. 3(d) for 16O+176Hf reaction, energy levels up to 4+ channels (solid green line) show contribution in the increment of the cross-section, whereas up to 6+ levels (solid blue line) are good enough for the enhancement of the fusion cross-sections for 16O+180Hf in comparison to the 1-D BPM as shown in Fig. 3(e). The results obtained for 16O+176Hf and 16O+180Hf\nreactions provide a satisfactory fit to the data well above barrier experimental values [79]. As shown in Fig. 3 (f), rotational energy levels up to 4+ (solid green line) contribute to enhancing the fusion cross-section for the 16O+174Yb reaction. In contrast, up to 6+ channels (solid blue line) contribute to an increase in the cross-section for the 16O+176Yb reaction, as shown in Fig. 3(g). The obtained results are good enough for\nthe convergence of available experimental data [62] mainly at the above barrier ener-\ngies. However, at below and near-barrier energies there is no discernible change in fusion cross-section after the inclusion of rotational energy levels beyond the 6+ state. The\nabove observation suggests that the fusion cross-sections are strongly influenced by the negative \u03b24 values as predicted in Refs. [59, 79]. Up to 6 + state has a considerable effect on the fusion cross-section in the case of \u03b24 deformation; however, the negligible impact can be observed for the rest of the channels. Furthermore, for all discussed systems, the\n\u03b24 values range from -0.042 to -0.095. In addition, the result shows that if \u03b24 lies in the range of -0.042 to -0.057, up to 4+ levels show contribution in the enhancement of the cross-section w.r.t 1-D BPM. The rotational levels up to 6+ state gives an acceptable fit\nbetween -0.066 and -0.095 range at above barrier energies. At -0.093 and -0.095 values of\nthe deformation parameter, there is a considerable difference in the fusion cross-section between 0+, 2+, and 4+ levels. Thus in general, with an increase in the magnitude of\n-ve \u03b24, there is an addition of a level or two, which starts contributing to the fusion cross-section.The relative change in the fusion cross-section w.r.t. rotational channels\nhas been plotted in Fig. 4 to thoroughly investigate the effect of individual channels on the cross-section corresponding to 16O+182W reaction. As the case illustrated for 16O+182W reaction, the relative change in the fusion cross-section of 1.06 % and 0.45 % has been observed at E = 73 MeV, 94 MeV corresponding to 4+ - 6+ state. On the other\nhand, the relative change in the cross-section observed is less than 1% at different Ec.m. corresponding to 6+ - 8+ state. It shows that the rotational channel has a considerable impact on the fusion cross-section up to the 6+ state, whereas the other higher channels\nhave a negligible effect. Similarly, the decreasing trend is noticed in the rest of the\nreactions (not shown here)."

            "text": "The same procedure as discussed in the previous section 3.1 is followed to calculate the fusion cross-sections for 16O+166Er, 16O+148,152,154Sm, 16O+150Nd reactions having\n\u03b22 > 0, \u03b24 > 0 values using the static Woods-Saxon potential by employing the CCFULL code. The Woods-Saxon parameterizations of Akyu\u0308z-Winther potential (AW),\ndeformation parameters \u03b22, \u03b24 and the excitation energy corresponding to the first excitation state are mentioned in Table 2. The values of AW potential parameters are\nchosen to fit the experimental data at the above barrier energies for the inert case or\n1-D BPM. The variation of the total interaction potential i.e. the sum of the WoodsSaxon and Coulomb potentials, at ` = 0~ with the separation distance \u2018r\u2019 for these systems is shown in Fig. 5. In comparison with the other reactions, the pocket formed in 16O+152Sm reaction is substantially deeper. The probability of fusion is expected to\nbe very significant for such relatively deeper pockets.\nThe solid black line in Fig. 6 represents the 1-D penetration case. From the\nfigure, one can observe that at below-barrier energies, the theoretical cross-section\nobtained using 1-D BPM underestimates the experimental values. As mentioned earlier,\nrotational channels are taken into account to reduce the fusion hindrance at the below-\nbarrier energies. Initially, the calculations are performed by considering the \u03b22 values ranging from 0.142 to 0.342. The contribution of the rotational energy levels in\nthe enhancement of the fusion cross-section obtained is the same as in the previous Section (3.1) except for 16O+148Sm nuclear reactions. In these reactions, the target\nnuclei have \u03b22 value 0.1423, whereas, in other reactions, the target nuclei are highly deformed (0.285 \u2264 \u03b22 \u2264 0.342). Based upon these values, the rotational levels up to 4+ show enhancement in the fusion cross-section as compared to the 1-D barrier\npenetration model as shown in Fig. 6(b). However, higher-order channels have a\nnegligible contribution toward the fusion cross-section. The ground state \u03b22 values alone as presented in Fig. 6 are incapable of reproducing the experimental data over\nthe whole energy range, thus need to be included in the \u03b24 along with \u03b22.\nThe positive \u03b24 plays an important role in the enhancement of the fusion cross-\nsections mainly at below-barrier energies. For 16O+166Er, there is an enhancement in\nthe fusion cross-sections up to 6+ levels (solid blue line) and other higher channels up to 12+ have negligible impact on fusion cross-sections to converge towards the experimental data [59] as shown in Fig. 7(a). The difference between 4+ and 6+ channel is quite significant because of strong \u03b22, and \u03b24 value for 166Er target nuclei. For Sm targets, there is a significant variation in the quadrupole deformation \u03b22 ranging from 0.1423 to 0.306 and also in the value of \u03b24 from 0.060 to 0.097 for 148Sm and 152Sm. For 16O+148Sm reaction, the effect of hexadecapole deformation on the fusion cross-section obtained is the same. Similarly, the outcomes of 16O+152Sm, and 16O+154Sm reactions are also identical. The 6+ channels (solid blue line) contribute to the enhancement of the fusion cross-section in 16O+148Sm reaction, as shown in Fig. 7 (b), and 7 (c). In contrast, the 10+ channels (solid magenta line) play a significant role in the increment of the fusion cross-section or reduced fusion hindrance at below barrier energies in 16O+152Sm, and 16O+154Sm reactions, as shown in Fig. 7(c), and 7(d).

(Color online) Same as Fig. 6, but with the inclusion of \u2212ve hexadecupole (\u03b24) deformation\nthe rotational energy levels is due to \u03b24 values because these values change significantly from 0.060 to 0.097. The significant change between each channel are observed because of strong deformation (\u03b22, \u03b24) values in case of 154Sm. Also, it is well known that 154Sm is a perfect rotor [84]. Further, with the inclusion of higher channels, a negligible effect\non the fusion cross-sections is observed. The similar results are obtained for 16O+150Nd reactions system. In the case of 16O+150Nd, 10+ (solid magenta line) channels play a significant role in increasing the\ncross-section, as illustrated in Fig. 7(e). These theoretical results provide a satisfactory\nfit with the experimental values [85]. The involvement of higher-order channels up to 12+ does not affect the fusion cross-sections. There is a significant difference between\ndifferent channels w.r.t. 1-D barrier penetration model because of +ve deformation values. From the above results, we conclude that the rotational levels up to 4+ are good\nenough to converge the experimental data except for the reaction in which \u03b22 values are less than 0.142. The value of the \u03b24 parameter for this system is 0.060. We can conclude from the above-discussed systems, that when the value of \u03b24 lie in a range\nbetween 0.007-0.060, rotational energy levels up to 6+ lead to an enhancement in the fusion cross-section. However, when the \u03b24 value lies in the range 0.097-0.110, 10 + levels play a significant role in increasing the cross-section and also provide a satisfactory fit\nwith the experimental values.\nAs illustrated for 16O+154Sm reaction , Fig. 8 depicts the relative change in the\nfusion cross-section with respect to rotational channels. The relative change in the fusion\ncross-section at E = 58 MeV (below the Coulomb barrier region) and 77 MeV (above\nthe Coulomb barrier region) of energy is 2.21 % and 0.15 %, respectively, corresponding to the 8+ - 10+ state. In contrast, at different Ec.m. corresponding to 10 + - 12+ states, the relative change in the cross-section found is less than 1%. However, Rowley et\nal. [28] had demonstrated that up to 3-channels of the rotational energy levels are enough to address the experimental data for 154Sm. Nonetheless, certain discrepancies\nwere evident between the experimental and the theoretical results. It was suggested\nthat with the inclusion of phonon(s) or transfer channels, these discrepancies can be overcome. Comparatively, here the relative change clearly shows that up to 10+ states\nof the rotational channel have a significant effect on the fusion cross-section. Moreover,\nour results indicate that when higher-order channels are used, there is no need to include\nthe phonon and/or the transfer coupling for reproducing the experimental data. The\nrest of the reactions follow the same pattern as the first in terms of decreasing intensity."

            "text": "The development of the radioactive beam makes it possible to synthesize a variety\nof nuclei that lie in the valley of stability as well as far from the \u03b2-stability region\nincluding the superheavy island. Determining the proper reaction dynamics necessitates\na thorough understanding of the synthesis and characteristics of these nuclei. Many\nefforts are being devoted to the direction of theoretical and experimental studies. On\nthe other hand, experimental verification is too difficult. As a result, we need to execute\ntheoretical modelling to confirm their characteristics in terms of reaction dynamics. As\nwe know, CCFULL is one of the computational codes used to study fusion dynamics,\nwhich requires a detailed description of Woods-Saxon nuclear potential parameters, i.e.,\nV0 and r0 of the colliding nuclei. It is difficult to extract the potential parameters for the recently synthesized or predicted target(s) nuclei with 16O induced reactions. As a result,\nfor interacting nuclei that lie in the stable and unstable mass region, one must fit the free\nparameters for the nuclear potential in CCFULL. Among the considered reactions, the fusion cross-sections for twelve reaction system, namely, 182,184,186W, 176,180Hf, 174,176Yb, 166Er, 148,152,154Sm, 150Nd are in good agreement with the available experimental data\nat above barrier energies.\nIn Woods-Saxon parameterization potential, the standard value of diffuseness\nparameter a0 = 0.65 fm and the value of the parameters such as V0 and r0 are difficult to extract for the unexplored reaction systems. The Woods-Saxon parameters available\non the NRV website [86] are unable to fit the experimental data even at the above\nbarrier energies. Thus the values of V0 and r0 used in this study are chosen to fit the experimental data at above barrier energies for the inert case and later on the coupling\nto various rotational energy levels is included. The motivation of the present study is to\nextract the relative contribution of individual rotational energy levels up to higher-order states (12+). Also, the results drawn are independent of the choice of nuclear potential.\nIn this direction, we have given an algebraic function by a linear fitting of the curve for\nknown systems as a function of ZPZT as shown in Fig. 9. Thus, one can generate the value of V0 and r0 using the algebraic formula for V02 = 66.9 + 0.00625ZpZt, and V01 = 60 MeV and r02 = 1.128 + 1.04 \u2217 10\u22124ZpZt, and r01 = 1.165fm. Here the subscript 1, and 2 stands for the lower and upper limit of the extracted band region for V0, and r0 as shown in Fig. (9). These fitted values of V0, and r0 are valid from ZpZt = 480 to ZpZt = 592 in the rotational region of the Periodic Table. Using these simple algebraic formulas, one can extract the potential parameters for the limited range of target nuclei interacting with 16O as a projectile, which will be proven essential for the upcoming\nexperiment."

            "text": "In the present work, we have studied the effect of individual rotational energy levels on\nthe fusion cross-section at deep sub-barrier energies in heavy-ion nuclear reactions. Here, we have considered 16O-induced reactions in which target nuclei chosen are rotational in nature(i.e. 182,184,186W, 176,180Hf, 174,176Yb, 166Er, 148,152,154Sm, 150Nd) and projectile\nis spherical. As such, we have demonstrated the effect of nuclear shapes on fusion\ncross-sections by considering the deformed target nuclei (rotational) only. For different\nvalues of deformation parameters, the role of different rotational energy levels has been\ndescribed in the terms of the fusion cross-sections. The contribution of the rotational energy levels up to 6+ levels has been observed on the fusion cross-section for quadrupole deformation (\u03b22). For -ve hexadecapole deformation, higher-order channels up to 6 + are found suitable for the convergence of the cross-sections towards experimental data whereas for +ve \u03b24 deformation, 10 + levels fit the data well. It is noticed that channels beyond 10+ have a negligible impact on the fusion cross-section. For the determination\nof the free parameter of Woods-Saxon potential, the parameters are fitted as an algebraic\nfunction of ZPZT . This work will be provided in identifying the combinations of the target nuclei with 16O projectile within the range of ZPZT from 480 to 592."
