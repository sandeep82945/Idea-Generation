            "text": "Fuzzy set is a fundamental tool to investigate fuzzy phenomenon [3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 26\u201328]. A fuzzy set can be identified with its endograph. Also, a fuzzy set can be identified with its sendograph. So convergence structures on fuzzy sets can be defined on their endographs or sendographs. The the endograph metric Hend convergence, the sendograh metric Hsend convergence and the \u0393-convergence are this kind of convergence structures. These three convergence structures are related to each other [14, 23].\n\u22c6Project supported by Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China(No. 2020J01706)\nEmail address: hhuangjy@126.com (Huan Huang)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\nThe endograph metric on fuzzy sets is shown to have significant advantages [21, 22]. The sendograph metric has attracted deserving attentions [5, 8]. Compactness is one of the central concepts in topology and analysis and is useful in applications (see [18, 26]). There is a lot of work devoted to characterizations of compactness in various fuzzy set spaces endowed with different topologies [5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 24, 25, 29]. It is natural to consider what the completion of a metric space is. The recent results on completions of fuzzy set spaces include [13, 14].\nIn [14], we presented the relations and level characterizations of the endograph metric Hend and the \u0393-convergence. Based on this, we have given the characterizations of total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness of fuzzy set spaces equipped with the endograph metric Hend. We also gave the completions of fuzzy set spaces according to the endograph metric Hend.\nThe common fuzzy sets used in theoretical research and practical applications are fuzzy sets in a metric space whose \u03b1-cuts are nonempty compact sets when \u03b1 > 0. Common compact fuzzy sets are common fuzzy sets whose support sets are compact. Throughout this paper, we suppose that X is a nonempty set and d is the metric on X . For simplicity, we also use X to denote the metric space (X, d). The symbols F 1USCG(X) and F 1 USCB(X) are used to denote the family of common fuzzy sets in X and the family of common compact fuzzy sets in X , respectively. We use F 1USC(X) to denote the family of normal and upper semi-continuous fuzzy sets in X . F 1USCB(X) is a subset of F 1USCG(X). F 1 USCG(X) is a subset of F 1 USC(X).\nThe results in [14] are obtained on the realm of fuzzy sets in the mdimensional Euclidean space Rm (R1 is also written as R). Rm is a special type of metric space. Of course, it is worth to study the fuzzy sets in a metric space [8, 9, 17]. In this paper, the results are obtained on the realm of fuzzy sets in a general metric space X . We mainly discuss Hend metric and Hsend metric on F 1USC(X) including the relations among Hend metric, Hsend metric and other convergence structures, and properties of Hend metric and Hsend metric.\nThe first part of this paper is devoted to the relations among the Hend metric, the Hsend metric and the \u0393-convergence, the level characterizations of the endograph metric Hend and the \u0393-convergence, and the relations among the supremum metric d\u221e, theHend metric, theHsend metric and the d \u2217 p metric. The d\u2217p metric is an expansion of the Lp-type dp metric on F 1 USC(X).\nTo aid discussion, we introduce the sets P 1USC(X) and P 1 USCB(X). An\nelement of P 1USC(X) (respectively, P 1 USCB(X)) is a subset of X\u00d7 [0, 1], which is equal to or in a specific way slightly larger than the sendograph of a certain fuzzy set in F 1USC(X) (respectively, F 1 USCB(X)). F 1 USC(X) and F 1 USCB(X) can be viewed as the subsets of P 1USC(X) and P 1 USCB(X), respectively. P 1 USCB(X) is a subset of P 1USC(X). We define the Hsend distance and the Hend distance on P 1 USC(X), and give the relations among theHsend distance, the Hend distance and the Kuratowski convergence on P 1USC(X). Then, as corollaries, we obtain the relations among the Hsend metric, the Hend metric and the \u0393-convergence on F 1 USC(X).\nWe discuss the level characterizations of the \u0393-convergence and the endograph metric Hend on fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). It is shown that under some conditions, the \u0393-convergence of fuzzy sets can be decomposed to the Kuratowski convergence of certain \u03b1-cuts, and the Hend metric convergence of fuzzy sets can be decomposed to the Hausdorff metric convergence of certain \u03b1-cuts.\nThe understanding of the relations among the Hend metric, the Hsend metric and the \u0393-convergence is beneficial for the understanding of themselves. The level characterizations help to study these three convergence structures on fuzzy sets by using the properties of the corresponding \u03b1-cuts.\nA Hsend metric convergent sequence must be a Hend metric convergent sequence. A Hend metric convergent sequence must be a \u0393-convergent sequence. So the knowledge of the \u0393-convergent sequences can help us to analyse the properties of the Hend convergent sequences and the Hsend convergent sequences. For this reason, we give the level characterizations of a \u0393-convergent sequence in this paper.\nBased on the results in the first part, we give the other results of this paper. The second part of this paper is devoted to the characterizations of total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness in (F 1USCG(X), Hend) and (F 1USCB(X), Hend), respectively. Here we mention that the characterization of relative compactness in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) has already been given by Greco [8].\nThe total boundedness is the key property of compactness in metric space. We show that a set U in (F 1USCG(X), Hend) is totally bounded (respectively, relatively compact) if and only if for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], the union of all the \u03b1cuts of u \u2208 U is totally bounded (respectively, relatively compact) in (X, d). We also show that a set U in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) is totally bounded if and only if the union of all the 0-cuts of u \u2208 U is totally bounded in (X, d) (see Section 7). These results indicate that for a set U in (F 1USCG(X), Hend) or\n(F 1USCB(X), Hsend), the total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness of U are closely related to the total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness of the union of all the \u03b1-cuts of u \u2208 U in (X, d), respectively.\nWe point out that some part of the proof of the characterizations in this paper is similar to the corresponding part in [14]. But in general, since a set in X need not have the properties of the set in Rm, the proof of the conclusions in this paper requires deep understandings of the problem.\nThe third part is devoted to the completions of several common fuzzy set spaces under the Hend metric and the Hsend metric, respectively.\nLet X\u0303 denote the completion ofX . We show that the space (P 1USCB(X\u0303), Hsend) is a completion of the fuzzy set space (F 1USCB(X), Hsend). Then we show that (F 1USCG(X\u0303), Hend) is a completion of (F 1 USCB(X), Hend). So, of course, (F 1USCG(X\u0303), Hend) is also a completion of (F 1 USCG(X), Hend).\nThese conclusions indicate that in the case of the Hend metric, a completion of the space of common compact fuzzy set in X is the space of common fuzzy set in X\u0303 ; in the case of the Hsend metric, a completion of the space of common compact fuzzy set in X is a metric space in which the space of common compact fuzzy set in X\u0303 can be isometrically embedded, and each element of which is a nonempty compact set in X\u0303 \u00d7 [0, 1].\nThe conclusions for the completions of the spaces of fuzzy set in X given in this paper apply to not only the cases that X is a complete metric space but also the cases that X is an incomplete metric space.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall and give some basic notions and fundamental results related to fuzzy sets and convergence structures on them. In Section 3, we discuss the properties and relations of Hsend, Hend and Kuratowski convergence on P 1 USC(X). Based on this, we give some relations among Hend, Hsend and \u0393-convergence on F 1USC(X). In Sections 4 and 5, we investigate the level characterizations of the \u0393-convergence and the Hend convergence, respectively. By using the above results, Section 6 discusses some relations among the d\u221e metric, the d\u2217p metric, the Hend metric and the Hsend metric. In Section 7, on the basis of the conclusions in previous sections, we give characterizations of total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness in (F 1USCG(X), Hend) and (F 1USCB(X), Hsend), respectively. In Section 8, we give completions of (F 1USCG(X), Hend) and (F 1 USCB(X), Hsend), respectively. At last, we draw the conclusions in Section 9."

In this paper, if we want to emphasize a specific metric space X , we will write the fuzzy set corresponding to S in X as SF (X), and the fuzzy set corresponding to {x} in X as x\u0302F (X).\nThe symbol F (X) is used to denote the set of all fuzzy sets in X . For u \u2208 F (X) and \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], let {u > \u03b1} denote the set {x \u2208 X : u(x) > \u03b1}, and let [u]\u03b1 denote the \u03b1-cut of u, i.e.\n[u]\u03b1 =\n{ {x \u2208 X : u(x) \u2265 \u03b1}, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1],\nsupp u = {u > 0}, \u03b1 = 0,\nwhere S denotes the topological closure of S in (X, d). For u \u2208 F (X), define\nend u := {(x, t) \u2208 X \u00d7 [0, 1] : u(x) \u2265 t},\nsend u := {(x, t) \u2208 X \u00d7 [0, 1] : u(x) \u2265 t} \u2229 ([u]0 \u00d7 [0, 1]).\nend u and send u are called the endograph and the sendograph of u, respectively.\nThe symbol K(X) and C(X) are used to denote the set of all nonempty compact subsets of X and the set of all nonempty closed subsets of X , respectively. The symbol N is used to denote the set of all positive integers.\nLet F 1USC(X) denote the set of all normal and upper semi-continuous fuzzy sets u : X \u2192 [0, 1], i.e.,\nF 1USC(X) := {u \u2208 F (X) : [u]\u03b1 \u2208 C(X) for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]}.\nWe introduce some subclasses of F 1USC(X), which will be discussed in this paper. Define\nF 1USCB(X) := {u \u2208 F 1 USC(X) : [u]0 \u2208 K(X)},\nF 1USCG(X) := {u \u2208 F 1 USC(X) : [u]\u03b1 \u2208 K(X) for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]}.\nClearly, F 1USCB(X) \u2286 F 1 USCG(X) \u2286 F 1 USC(X).\nThe following representation theorems for F 1USCB(X), F 1 USCG(X), F 1 USC(X)\nare similar to Theorem 3.3 in [14].\nProposition 2.1. Let u \u2208 F 1USCB(X) (respectively, u \u2208 F 1 USCG(X), u \u2208 F 1USC(X)). Then (i) [u]\u03b1 \u2208 K(X) for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] (respectively, [u]\u03b1 \u2208 K(X) for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], [u]\u03b1 \u2208 C(X) for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]); (ii) [u]\u03b1 = \u22c2 \u03b2<\u03b1[u]\u03b2 for all\n\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]; (iii) [u]0 = \u22c3\n\u03b1>0[u]\u03b1. Moreover, if the family of sets {v\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]} satisfies (i) through (iii), then there exists a unique u \u2208 F 1USCB(X) (respectively, u \u2208 F 1 USCG(X), u \u2208 F 1USC(X)) such that [u]\u03b1 = v\u03b1 for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\nUsing Proposition 2.1, we can define a certain type fuzzy set by giving the family of its \u03b1-cuts. For brevity, in the sequel, we often directly point out that what we defined is a certain type fuzzy set without mentioning the use of Proposition 2.1 since it is easy to see.\nLet (X, d) be a metric space. We use H to denote the Hausdorff distance on C(X) induced by d, i.e.,\nH(U,V ) = max{H\u2217(U, V ), H\u2217(V, U)}\nfor arbitrary U, V \u2208 C(X), where\nH\u2217(U, V ) = sup u\u2208U d (u, V ) = sup u\u2208U inf v\u2208V d (u, v).\nThe metric d on X \u00d7 [0, 1] is defined as follows: for (x, \u03b1), (y, \u03b2) \u2208 X \u00d7 [0, 1],\nd((x, \u03b1), (y, \u03b2)) = d(x, y) + |\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2|.\nThroughout this paper, we suppose that the metric on X\u00d7 [0, 1] is d. For simplicity, we also use X \u00d7 [0, 1] to denote the metric space (X \u00d7 [0, 1], d).\nIf there is no confusion, we also use H to denote the Hausdorff distance on C(X \u00d7 [0, 1]) induced by d.\nRemark 2.2. \u03c1 is said to be a metric on Y if \u03c1 is a function from Y \u00d7 Y into R satisfying positivity, symmetry and triangle inequality. At this time, (Y, \u03c1) is said to be a metric space.\n\u03c1 is said to be an extended metric on Y if \u03c1 is a function from Y \u00d7Y into R \u222a {+\u221e} satisfying positivity, symmetry and triangle inequality. At this time, (Y, \u03c1) is said to be an extended metric space.\nWe can see that for arbitrary metric space (X, d), the Hausdorff distance H on K(X) induced by d is a metric. So the Hausdorff distance H on K(X \u00d7 [0, 1]) induced by d on X \u00d7 [0, 1] is a metric.\nThe Hausdorff distance H on C(X) induced by d on X is an extended metric, but may not be a metric, because H(A,B) could be equal to +\u221e for certain metric space X and A,B \u2208 C(X). Clearly, if H on C(X) induced by d is not a metric, then H on C(X \u00d7 [0, 1]) induced by d is also not a metric. So the Hausdorff distance H on C(X\u00d7 [0, 1]) induced by d on X\u00d7 [0, 1] is an extended metric but may not be a metric. We can see that H on C(Rm) is an extended metric but not a metric, and then the same is H on C(Rm\u00d7 [0, 1]).\nWe call the Hausdorff distance H the Hausdorff metric (respectively, the Hausdorff extended metric) if H is a metric (respectively, an extended metric). In this paper, for simplicity, we refer to both the Hausdorff extended metric and the Hausdorff metric as the Hausdorff metric.\nThe Hausdorff metric has the following important properties.\nTheorem 2.3. [19, 24] Let (X, d) be a metric space and let H be the Hausdorff metric induced by d. Then (i) (X, d) is complete \u21d0\u21d2 (K(X), H) is complete; (ii) (X, d) is separable \u21d0\u21d2 (K(X), H) is separable; (iii) (X, d) is compact \u21d0\u21d2 (K(X), H) is compact.\nRojas-Medar and Roma\u0301n-Flores [23] introduced the \u0393-convergence of a sequence of fuzzy sets in a metric space based on the Kuratowski convergence of a sequence of sets in a certain metric space.\nLet (X, d) be a metric space. Let C be a set in X and {Cn} a sequence of sets in X . {Cn} is said to Kuratowski converge to C, if\nC = lim inf n\u2192\u221e Cn = lim sup n\u2192\u221e Cn,\nwhere\nlim inf n\u2192\u221e Cn = {x \u2208 X : x = lim n\u2192\u221e xn, xn \u2208 Cn},\nlim sup n\u2192\u221e Cn = {x \u2208 X : x = lim j\u2192\u221e\nxnj , xnj \u2208 Cnj} = \u221e\u22c2\nn=1\n\u22c3\nm\u2265n\nCm.\nIn this case, we will write C = lim(K) n\u2192\u221e Cn.\nRemark 2.4. Definition 3.1.4 in [19] gives the definitions of lim inf Cn, lim supCn and limCn for a net of subsets {Cn, n \u2208 D} in a topological space. When {Cn, n = 1, 2, . . .} is a sequence of subsets of a metric space, lim inf Cn, lim supCn and limCn according to Definition 3.1.4 in [19] are lim infn\u2192\u221eCn, lim supn\u2192\u221eCn and lim (K) n\u2192\u221eCn according to the above definitions, respectively. So Corollary 3.2.13 in [19] implies Theorem 4.2.\nLet u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F (X). {un} is said to \u0393converge to u, denoted by u = lim(\u0393)\nn\u2192\u221e un, if end u = lim (K) n\u2192\u221e end un.\nHere lim(K)n\u2192\u221e end un is considered with respect to (X \u00d7 [0, 1], d). Let (X, d) be a metric space and let u \u2208 F (X). Then from basic analysis,\nthe following three properties are equivalent: (i) u is upper semi-continuous; (ii) end u is closed in (X \u00d7 [0, 1], d); (iii) send u is closed in (X \u00d7 [0, 1], d).\nKloeden [20] introduced the endograph metric Hend. The endograph metric Hend and the sendograph metric Hsend on F 1 USC(X) are defined as follows. For u, v \u2208 F 1USC(X),\nHend(u, v) := H(end u, end v),\nHsend(u, v) := H(send u, send v),\nwhere H is the Hausdorff metric on C(X \u00d7 [0, 1]) induced by d on X \u00d7 [0, 1]. The d\u221e metric on F 1 USC(X) is defined as follows: for u, v \u2208 F 1 USC(X),\nd\u221e(u, v) := sup{H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) : \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]}.\nBelow property (1) may be known. We gave this kind of conclusion in [12].\nFor each u, v \u2208 F 1USC(X), d\u221e(u, v) \u2265 Hsend(u, v) \u2265 Hend(u, v). (1)\nRemark 2.5. We can see thatHend is a metric on F 1 USC(X) withHend(u, v) \u2264 1 for all u, v \u2208 F 1USC(X). Both d\u221e and Hsend are metrics on F 1 USCB(X). However, each one of d\u221e and Hsend on F 1 USC(X) is an extended metric but may not be a metric. See also Remark 3.3 in [15]. We can see that both d\u221e and Hsend on F 1 USCG(Rm) are not metrics, they are extended metrics.\nFor simplicity, in this paper, we call Hsend on F 1 USC(X) the Hsend metric or the sendograph metric Hsend. We call d\u221e on F 1 USC(X) the d\u221e metric or the supremum metric d\u221e.\n3. Hend, Hsend and Kuratowski convergence on P 1 USC (X)\nIn this section, we introduce P 1USC(X) and its subset P 1 USCB(X), and define the Hsend distance and the Hend distance on P 1 USC(X). We discuss the properties and relations of Hsend, Hend and Kuratowski convergence on P 1USC(X). Based on this, we give some relations among Hend, Hsend and \u0393-convergence on F 1USC(X).\nFor u \u2286 X \u00d7 [0, 1] and \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], define \u3008u\u3009\u03b1 := {x : (x, \u03b1) \u2208 u}. P 1USC(X) and P 1 USCB(X) are subsets of the power set of X\u00d7 [0, 1] defined by\nP 1 USC (X) := {u \u2286 X \u00d7 [0, 1] : \u3008u\u3009\u03b1 = \u22c2\n\u03b2<\u03b1\n\u3008u\u3009\u03b2 for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1];\n\u3008u\u3009\u03b1 \u2208 C(X) for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]},\nP 1 USCB (X) := {u \u2208 P 1USC(X) : \u3008u\u3009\u03b1 \u2208 K(X) for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]}.\nClearly P 1USCB(X) \u2286 P 1 USC(X).\nBy Proposition 2.1, we can see F 1USC(X) (respectively, F 1 USCB(X)) as a subset of P 1USC(X) (respectively, P 1 USCB(X)) by identifying a fuzzy set with its sendograph. So the conclusions on P 1USC(X) and P 1 USCB(X) are useful for the discussions of fuzzy sets in this paper. From the basic analysis, we can obtain that (i) if u \u2208 P 1USC(X), then u \u2208 C(X \u00d7 [0, 1]); (ii) if u \u2208 C(X \u00d7 [0, 1]), then \u3008u\u3009\u03b1 \u2208 C(X) \u222a {\u2205} for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]; (iii) if u \u2208 P 1USCB(X), then u \u2208 K(X \u00d7 [0, 1]); (iv) if u \u2208 K(X \u00d7 [0, 1]), then \u3008u\u3009\u03b1 \u2208 K(X) \u222a {\u2205} for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\nSo we have\nP 1USC(X) = {u \u2208 C(X \u00d7 [0, 1]) : \u3008u\u30091 6= \u2205, \u3008u\u3009\u03b1 = \u22c2\n\u03b2<\u03b1\n\u3008u\u3009\u03b2 for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]},\nP 1USCB(X) = {u \u2208 P 1 USC(X) : u \u2208 K(X \u00d7 [0, 1])}.\nWe define the Hsend distance and the Hend distance on P 1 USC(X): for each\nu, v \u2208 P 1USC(X),\nHsend(u, v) := H(u, v), Hend(u, v) := H(u, v),\nwhere H is the Hausdorff metric on C(X \u00d7 [0, 1]) induced by d on X \u00d7 [0, 1], and u := u \u222a (X \u00d7 {0}).\nAs Hsend on P 1 USC(X) is the restriction to P 1 USC(X) \u00d7 P 1 USC(X) of the Hausdorff extended metric H on C(X \u00d7 [0, 1]), we have that Hsend is an extended metric on P 1USC(X).\nObviously Hend \u2264 1 on P 1 USC(X). Hend is a pseudometric on P 1 USC(X); that is, for all u, v \u2208 P 1USC(X), Hend(u, v) \u2208 R and Hend(u, u) = 0, and Hend satisfies symmetry and triangle inequality. Hend is a metric on P 1 USC(X) if and only if X is a singleton. The \u201cif\u201d part is obvious. To show the \u201conly if\u201d part, assume that X contains more than one point. Let x, y \u2208 X with x 6= y. Define u \u2208 P 1USCB(X) by putting \u3008u\u3009\u03b1 = {x} for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], and v \u2208 P 1USCB(X) by putting \u3008v\u3009\u03b1 = {x} for \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1] and \u3008v\u30090 = {x, y}. Then u 6= v and Hend(u, v) = 0. So Hend does not satisfy the positivity and hence is not a metric on P 1USC(X).\nDefine a function f : F 1USC(X) \u2192 P 1 USC(X) by f(u) = send u. Then f is an isometric embedding of (F 1USC(X), Hsend) in (P 1 USC(X), Hsend). So (F 1USC(X), Hsend) can be embedded isometrically in (P 1 USC(X), Hsend). Note that f(F 1USCB(X)) \u2286 P 1 USCB(X). Thus (F 1 USCB(X), Hsend) can be embedded isometrically in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend). For u \u2208 F 1USC(X), we define\n\u2212\u2192u := f(u) = send u. Then \u2212\u2192u \u2208 P 1USC(X). Let v \u2208 P 1USC(X). Define v \u2032 \u2208 f(F 1USC(X)) \u2286 P 1 USC(X) by putting\n\u3008v\u2032\u3009\u03b1 =\n{ \u3008v\u3009\u03b1, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1],\n\u222a\u03b1>0\u3008v\u3009\u03b1, \u03b1 = 0.\nDefine \u2190\u2212v \u2208 F 1USC(X) by putting [ \u2190\u2212v ]\u03b1 = \u3008v \u2032\u3009\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. Then \u2212\u2192\u2190\u2212v = f(\u2190\u2212v ) = v\u2032. \u3008v\u30090 \u2287 \u3008v \u2032\u30090 as \u3008v\u30090 \u2208 C(X) and \u3008v\u30090 \u2287 \u222a\u03b1>0\u3008v\u3009\u03b1. Note that \u3008v\u30090 = \u3008v \u2032\u30090 \u222a \u3008v\u30090 \\ \u3008v\u2032\u30090. Thus we have (a) v = v\n\u2032 \u222a (\u3008v\u30090 \\ \u3008v\u2032\u30090 \u00d7 {0}). So P 1USC(X) = {\n\u2212\u2192u \u222a (A \u00d7 {0}) : u \u2208 F 1USC(X), A \u2208 C(X) \u222a {\u2205}} (\u201c\u2286\u201d follows from (a), and \u201c\u2287\u201d is obvious). Clearly \u3008v\u30090 \u2208 K(X) if and only if \u3008v\u2032\u30090 \u2208 K(X) and \u3008v\u30090 \\ \u3008v\u2032\u30090 \u2208 K(X)\u222a{\u2205}. So P 1 USCB(X) = {\n\u2212\u2192u \u222a(A\u00d7{0}) : u \u2208 F 1USCB(X), A \u2208 K(X)\u222a{\u2205}} (\u201c\u2287\u201d is obvious). We can see that the above two expressions of P 1USC(X) and P 1 USCB(X) remain true if \u201c\u222a{\u2205}\u201d is deleted in them. For a subset U of F 1USC(X), we use \u2212\u2192 U to denote the set {\u2212\u2192u : u \u2208 U}. For a subset U of P 1USC(X), we use \u2190\u2212 U to denote the set {\u2190\u2212u : u \u2208 U}. Clearly \u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 P 1USC(X) = F 1 USC(X) and \u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 P 1USCB(X) = F 1 USCB(X).\nProposition 3.1. Let v \u2208 P 1USC(X). Suppose the conditions: (i) v \u2208\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USC(X); (ii) \u3008v\u30090 = \u22c3 \u03b4>0\u3008v\u3009\u03b4; (iii) v = v \u2032; (iv) \u3008v\u30090 = [ \u2190\u2212v ]0; (v) v \u2208\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USCB(X); (vi) lim\u03b4\u21920+ H(\u3008v\u3009\u03b4, \u3008v\u30090) = 0. (a) (v)\u21d2(vi)\u21d2(i)\u21d4(ii)\u21d4(iii)\u21d4(iv). (b) If v \u2208 P 1USCB(X), then (i)\u21d4(ii)\u21d4(iii)\u21d4(iv)\u21d4(v)\u21d4(vi).\nProof. Clearly (i)\u21d4(ii)\u21d4(iii)\u21d4(iv). By Lemma 5.4(v), (v)\u21d2(vi). From Remark 3.6(i), (vi)\u21d2(ii). So (a) is proved.\nIf v \u2208 P 1USCB(X), then \u3008v\u30090 \u2208 K(X). Assume that (i) is true; that is, there is a u \u2208 F 1USC(X) with v =\n\u2212\u2192u . Then [u]0 = \u3008v\u30090, and thus u \u2208 F 1USCB(X). Hence (i)\u21d2(v). So from (a), we have that (b) is true.\nTheorem 3.2. Let (X, d) be a metric space. For u, v \u2208 P 1USC(X): (i) Hend(u, v) \u2264 Hsend(u, v); (ii) H(\u3008u\u30090, \u3008v\u30090) \u2264 Hsend(u, v); (iii) If Hend(u, v) < 1, then Hsend(u, v) \u2264 Hend(u, v) +H(\u3008u\u30090, \u3008v\u30090). For a sequence {un} in P 1 USC(X) and u in P 1 USC(X): (iv) Hsend(un, u)\u2192 0 if and only if Hend(un, u)\u2192 0 and H(\u3008un\u30090, \u3008u\u30090)\u2192 0; (v) lim(K)n\u2192\u221e un = u if and only if lim (K) n\u2192\u221e un = u and lim (K) n\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090 = \u3008u\u30090.\nProof. Clearly (i) and (ii) are true. To show (iii), let (x, \u03b1) \u2208 u. It suffices to verify the following property (a) if Hend(u, v) < 1, then\nd((x, \u03b1), v) \u2264 Hend(u, v) +H(\u3008u\u30090, \u3008v\u30090). (2)\nWe claim that (b) d((x, \u03b1), v) \u2264 \u03b1 + d(x, \u3008v\u30090) \u2264 \u03b1 +H(\u3008u\u30090, \u3008v\u30090), and (c) if d((x, \u03b1), v) < \u03b1, then d((x, \u03b1), v) = d((x, \u03b1), v) \u2264 Hend(u, v).\nNotice that d((x, \u03b1), v) \u2264 d((x, \u03b1), \u3008v\u30090\u00d7{0}) \u2264 d((x, \u03b1), (x, 0))+d((x, 0), \u3008v\u30090\u00d7 {0}) = \u03b1+d(x, \u3008v\u30090). Thus (b) is true. Note that d((x, \u03b1), v) = min{d((x, \u03b1), v), d((x, \u03b1), X\u00d7 {0})} = min{d((x, \u03b1), v), \u03b1}. So if d((x, \u03b1), v) < \u03b1, then d((x, \u03b1), v) = d((x, \u03b1), v). Thus (c) is true.\nIf \u03b1 \u2208 [0, Hend(u, v)], then by (b), (2) holds. If Hend(u, v) < 1 and \u03b1 \u2208 (Hend(u, v), 1], then d((x, \u03b1), v) < \u03b1. Hence by (c), d((x, \u03b1), v) \u2264 Hend(u, v), and thus (2) holds. So (a) is true and then (iii) is proved.\nLet u, v \u2208 P 1USC(X). Suppose the following conditions (d-1) Hend(u, v) = 0, (d-2) H(\u3008u\u30090, \u3008v\u30090) = 0, and (d-3) H(\u3008u\u30090, \u3008v\u30090) = +\u221e. If (d-1) holds, then by (ii) and (iii), Hsend(u, v) = H(\u3008u\u30090, \u3008v\u30090). If (d-2) holds, then \u3008u\u30090 = \u3008v\u30090 and so Hsend(u, v) = Hend(u, v). If (d-3) holds, then by (ii), Hsend(u, v) = +\u221e. So if one of the conditions (d-1), (d-2), and (d-3) holds, then Hsend(u, v) = Hend(u, v) +H(\u3008u\u30090, \u3008v\u30090). However, the converse is false.\n(iv) follows immediately from (i), (ii) and (iii). Below we verify (v).\nSuppose that lim(K)n\u2192\u221e un = u. To show lim (K) n\u2192\u221e un = u and lim (K) n\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090 =\n\u3008u\u30090, we only need to show that\nu \u2286 lim inf n\u2192\u221e un, lim sup n\u2192\u221e un \u2286 u,\n\u3008u\u30090 \u2286 lim inf n\u2192\u221e \u3008un\u30090, lim sup n\u2192\u221e \u3008un\u30090 \u2286 \u3008u\u30090.\nLet (x, \u03b1) \u2208 u. If \u03b1 = 0, then clearly (x, \u03b1) \u2208 lim infn\u2192\u221e un. If \u03b1 > 0, then (x, \u03b1) \u2208 u, and thus (x, \u03b1) \u2208 lim infn\u2192\u221e un \u2286 lim infn\u2192\u221e un. So u \u2286 lim infn\u2192\u221e un.\nLet (x, \u03b1) \u2208 lim supn\u2192\u221e un. If \u03b1 = 0, then clearly (x, \u03b1) \u2208 u. If \u03b1 > 0, then (x, \u03b1) \u2208 lim supn\u2192\u221e un = u \u2286 u. So lim supn\u2192\u221e un \u2286 u.\nLet x \u2208 \u3008u\u30090. Then (x, 0) \u2208 u = lim infn\u2192\u221e un. Thus there is a sequence {(xn, \u03b1n)} such that (xn, \u03b1n) \u2208 un, n = 1, 2, . . . and (x, 0) = limn\u2192\u221e(xn, \u03b1n). Hence xn \u2208 \u3008un\u30090 and x = limn\u2192\u221e xn. So \u3008u\u30090 \u2286 lim infn\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090.\nLet x \u2208 lim supn\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090. Then there is a sequence {xni} such that xni \u2208 \u3008uni\u30090, i = 1, 2, . . . and x = limi\u2192\u221e xni . Thus (x, 0) = limi\u2192\u221e(xni , 0) \u2208 lim supn\u2192\u221e un = u. Hence x \u2208 \u3008u\u30090. So lim supn\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090 \u2286 \u3008u\u30090.\nSuppose that lim(K)n\u2192\u221e un = u and lim (K) n\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090 = \u3008u\u30090. To show lim (K) n\u2192\u221e un =\nu, we only need to show that\nu \u2286 lim inf n\u2192\u221e un, lim sup n\u2192\u221e un \u2286 u.\nLet (x, \u03b1) \u2208 u. If \u03b1 = 0, then x \u2208 \u3008u\u30090 = lim (K) n\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090. Thus there is a sequence {xn} such that xn \u2208 \u3008un\u30090, n = 1, 2, . . . and x = limn\u2192\u221e xn. Hence (x, \u03b1) = (x, 0) = limn\u2192\u221e(xn, 0) \u2208 lim infn\u2192\u221e un.\nIf \u03b1 > 0, then from (x, \u03b1) \u2208 u = lim(K)n\u2192\u221e un, there is a sequence {(xn, \u03b1n)} such that (x, \u03b1) = limn\u2192\u221e(xn, \u03b1n), and (xn, \u03b1n) \u2208 un and \u03b1n > 0 for n = 1, 2, . . .. Thus (xn, \u03b1n) \u2208 un, n = 1, 2, . . . and hence (x, \u03b1) \u2208 lim infn\u2192\u221e un.\nLet (x, \u03b1) \u2208 lim supn\u2192\u221e un. Then there is a sequence {(xn, \u03b1n)} such that for each n \u2208 N, (xn, \u03b1n) \u2208 un, and d((xn, \u03b1n), (x, \u03b1)) \u2192 0. So for each n \u2208 N, xn \u2208 \u3008un\u30090, and d(xn, x)\u2192 0, and hence x \u2208 lim supn\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090 = \u3008u\u30090. Clearly (x, \u03b1) \u2208 lim supn\u2192\u221e un = u. Thus (x, \u03b1) \u2208 u.\nFor each u, v \u2208 P 1USC(X), u = end \u2190\u2212u and so Hend(u, v) = Hend( \u2190\u2212u ,\u2190\u2212v ). For each u \u2208 F 1USC(X), [u]0 = \u3008 \u2212\u2192u \u30090 and end u = ( \u2212\u2192u ). Let u, v \u2208 F 1USC(X). Then \u2212\u2192u ,\u2212\u2192v \u2208 P 1USC(X), andHsend(u, v) = Hsend(\n\u2212\u2192u ,\u2212\u2192v ), Hend(u, v) = Hend( \u2212\u2192u ,\u2212\u2192v ), and H([u]0, [v]0) = H(\u3008 \u2212\u2192u \u30090, \u3008 \u2212\u2192v \u30090). Thus (i), (ii)\nand (iii) in Theorem 3.2 imply that (the following (3) is part of (1))\nHend(u, v) \u2264 Hsend(u, v), (3)\nH([u]0, [v]0) \u2264 Hsend(u, v), (4)\nif Hend(u, v) < 1, then Hsend(u, v) \u2264 Hend(u, v) +H([u]0, [v]0). (5)\nProposition 3.3. Let u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). (i) Hsend(un, u)\u2192 0 if and only if Hend(un, u)\u2192 0 and H([un]0, [u]0)\u2192 0. (ii) lim(K)n\u2192\u221e send un = send u if and only if lim (\u0393) n\u2192\u221e un = u and lim (K) n\u2192\u221e[un]0 = [u]0.\nProof. (i) follows immediately from (3), (4) and (5). (i) can be seen as a special case of the clause (iv) in Theorem 3.2. (ii) can be seen as a special case of the clause (v) in Theorem 3.2.\nThe following Theorem 3.4 is an already known conclusion1, which is useful in this paper. It can be proved in a similar fashion to Theorem 4.1 in [14]. In Theorem 4.1 in [14], we include the case that C = \u2205. In Theorem 3.4, we exclude the case that C = \u2205.\nTheorem 3.4. Suppose that C, Cn are sets in C(X), n = 1, 2, . . .. Then H(Cn, C)\u2192 0 implies that lim (K) n\u2192\u221eCn = C.\nRemark 3.5. From Theorem 3.4, we obtain that for u, un, n = 1, 2, . . . in P 1USC(X): (i)Hend(un, u)\u2192 0 implies that lim (K) n\u2192\u221e un = u; (ii)Hsend(un, u)\u2192 0 implies that lim(K)n\u2192\u221e un = u. So for u, un, n = 1, 2, . . . in F 1 USC(X): (iii) Hend(un, u) \u2192 0 implies that lim(\u0393)n\u2192\u221e un = u; (iv) Hsend(un, u)\u2192 0 implies that lim (K) n\u2192\u221e send un = send u.\nThe converses of the implications in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) in Remark 3.5 are false. Let u = [0,+\u221e)F (R) and for n = 1, 2, . . ., let un = [0, n]F (R). Then lim (K) n\u2192\u221e send un = send u, but Hend(un, u) = 1 6\u2192 0. So combined with Proposition 3.3, the converses of the implications in (iii) and (iv) are false, and thus the converses of the implications in (i) and (ii) are false.\n1Theorem 3.4 may come from [1]. However we cannot obtain [1]. A reviewer kindly recommended [1] and the symbol \u03c7S in Paragraph 2 of Section 2.\nRemark 3.6. Let U \u2208 C(X) and let {u(\u03b1) : \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]} be a subset of C(X) with u(\u03b1) \u2287 u(\u03b2) for all 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1. (i) If \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1) and lim\u03b3\u2192\u03b1+ H(u(\u03b3), U) = 0, then U = \u22c3 \u03b3>\u03b1 u(\u03b3);\n(ii) If \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1] and lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212H(u(\u03b2), U) = 0, then U = \u22c2\n\u03b2<\u03b1 u(\u03b2). Assume that \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1) and lim\u03b3\u2192\u03b1+ H(u(\u03b3), U) = 0. Choose a decreasing sequence {\u03b3n} in (\u03b1, 1] with \u03b3n \u2192 \u03b1+. Then limn\u2192\u221eH(u(\u03b3n), U) = 0. Thus by Theorem 3.4, U = lim(K)n\u2192\u221e u(\u03b3n) = \u22c3 n\u2208N u(\u03b3n) = \u22c3 \u03b3>\u03b1 u(\u03b3), and hence (i) is true. Assume that \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1] and lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212 H(u(\u03b2), U) = 0. Choose an increasing sequence {\u03b2n} in [0, \u03b1) with \u03b2n \u2192 \u03b1\u2212. Then limn\u2192\u221eH(u(\u03b2n), U) = 0. Thus by Theorem 3.4, U = lim(K)n\u2192\u221e u(\u03b2n) = \u22c2 n\u2208N u(\u03b2n) = \u22c2 \u03b2<\u03b1 u(\u03b2), and hence (ii) is true."

            "text": "In this section, we investigate the level characterizations of the \u0393-convergence. It is shown that under some conditions, the \u0393-convergence of fuzzy sets can be decomposed to the Kuratowski convergence of certain \u03b1-cuts.\nThroughout this paper, we suppose that the measure on R is the Lebesgue measure.\nRojas-Medar and Roma\u0301n-Flores ([23]) have presented the following important and useful property of the \u0393-convergence.\nTheorem 4.1. [23] Suppose that u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., are fuzzy sets in F 1USC(X). Then lim (\u0393) n\u2192\u221e un = u if and only if for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1],\n{u > \u03b1} \u2286 lim inf n\u2192\u221e [un]\u03b1 \u2286 lim sup n\u2192\u221e [un]\u03b1 \u2286 [u]\u03b1. (6)\nTheorem 4.2 is Theorem 2.1 in [14]. Of course, the conclusion that lim supn\u2192\u221eCn are closed sets in (X, d) in Theorem 4.2 can also be deduced from the fact that lim supn\u2192\u221eCn = \u221e\u22c2 n=1 \u22c3 m\u2265n Cm.\nTheorem 4.2. [19] Let (X, d) be a metric space and let {Cn} be a sequence of sets in X. Then lim infn\u2192\u221eCn and lim supn\u2192\u221eCn are closed sets in (X, d).\nTheorem 4.3. Suppose that u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., are fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). Then lim(\u0393)n\u2192\u221e un = u if and only if for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1],\n{u > \u03b1} \u2286 lim inf n\u2192\u221e [un]\u03b1 \u2286 lim sup n\u2192\u221e [un]\u03b1 \u2286 [u]\u03b1.\nProof. By Theorem 4.2, for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], lim infn\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1 is a closed set in (X, d). So the desired result follows from Theorem 4.1.\nRemark 4.4. Suppose that u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., are fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). If lim(\u0393)n\u2192\u221e un = u, then (i) [u]0 = \u222a\u03b1>0 lim infn\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1, (ii) [u]0 \u2286 lim infn\u2192\u221e[un]0, and (iii) [u]0 $ lim infn\u2192\u221e[un]0 may happen.\nBy Theorem 4.1, [u]0 = \u222a\u03b1>0{u > \u03b1} \u2286 \u222a\u03b1>0 lim infn\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1 \u2286 \u222a\u03b1>0[u]\u03b1 = [u]0. So (i) is true. By Theorem 4.2, lim infn\u2192\u221e[un]0 is closed in (X, d), so \u222a\u03b1>0 lim infn\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1 \u2286 lim infn\u2192\u221e[un]0, and then (ii) follows from (i). We show (iii) by the following example. Let u = 0\u0302F (R) and for n = 1, 2, . . ., define un \u2208 F 1 USCB(R) as\nun(x) =    1, x = 0, 1/n, x \u2208 (0, 1], 0, otherwise.\nThen Hend(un, u)\u2192 0, and therefore from Remark 3.5 lim (\u0393) n\u2192\u221e un = u. And [u]0 = {0} $ [0, 1] = lim infn\u2192\u221e[un]0. Since lim(\u0393)n\u2192\u221e un = u implies that [u]0 \u2286 lim infn\u2192\u221e[un]0, then by Proposition 3.3, lim(K)n\u2192\u221e send un = send u if and only if lim (\u0393) n\u2192\u221e un = u and [u]0 \u2287 lim supn\u2192\u221e[un]0.\nLet u \u2208 F (X). Denote\nD(u) := {\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) : [u]\u03b1 * {u > \u03b1}},\nP (u) := {\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) : {u > \u03b1} $ [u]\u03b1}.\nA number \u03b1 in P (u) is called a platform point of u. Clearly P (u) \u2286 D(u). P (u) $ D(u) could happen. See Example 4.5.\nExample 4.5. let u \u2208 F (R) be defined by\nu(x) =    1, x \u2208 (0, 1), 0.6, x \u2208 [1, 3], 0, x \u2208 R \\ (0, 3].\nThen P (u) = \u2205 and D(u) = {0.6}. So P (u) $ D(u).\nThe symbol l2 denotes the Hilbert space l2 := {(xi) +\u221e i=1 : \u2211+\u221e i=1 x 2 i < +\u221e}. \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 and \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 denote the norm and inner product on l2, respectively. For each x = (xi) +\u221e i=1 and y = (yi) +\u221e i=1 in l 2, \u3008x, y\u3009 = \u2211+\u221e i=1 xi \u00b7 yi and \u2016x\u2016 =\n\u221a \u3008x, x\u3009. Rm can be seen as a subspace of l2. \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 and \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 are also used to denote the Euclidean norm and Euclidean inner product on Rm, respectively. A set S is said to be countable if it is finite or countably infinite. In this\nsense, \u201ccountable\u201d means the same as \u201cat most countable\u201d. Theorem 5.1 in [14] says that D(u) is countable when u \u2208 F (Rm).\nTheorem 4.6. Let u \u2208 F (l2). Then the set D(u) is countable.\nProof. The proof is similar to that of Theorem 5.1 in [14]. A sketch of the proof is given as follows. We use S1 to denote the set {e \u2208 l2 : \u2016e\u2016 = 1}.\nFor each t \u2208 l2 and r > 0, define Su,t,r(\u00b7, \u00b7) : S 1 \u00d7 [0, 1]\u2192 {\u2212\u221e} \u222a R by\nSu,t,r(e, \u03b1) =\n{ \u2212\u221e, if [u]\u03b1 \u2229B(t, r) = \u2205,\nsup{\u3008e, x\u2212 t\u3009 : x \u2208 [u]\u03b1 \u2229B(t, r)}, if [u]\u03b1 \u2229B(t, r) 6= \u2205,\nwhere B(t, r) := {x \u2208 l2 : \u2016x\u2212 t\u2016 < r} and B(t, r) := {x \u2208 l2 : \u2016x\u2212 t\u2016 \u2264 r}. Let t \u2208 l2, r > 0 and e \u2208 S1. Define a set D(u, t, r, e) as follows: \u03b1 \u2208 D(u, t, r, e) if and only if (i) \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) and Su,t,r(e, \u03b1) \u2208 R, (ii) Su,t,r(e, \u03b2) = \u2212\u221e for all \u03b2 > \u03b1 or \u2212\u221e < lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1+ Su,t,r(e, \u03b2) < lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212 Su,t,r(e, \u03b2). From the monotonicity of Su,t,r(e, \u00b7), D(u, t, r, e) is countable. Then proceed similarly to the proof of Lemma A.1 in [14] (Delete the \u201c,\u201d and add \u201cand all e, f \u2208 S1,\u201d at the end of line 9 of page 82 in [14] and the narrative of this proof will become clearer), in more detail, replacing Sm\u22121 by S1 in this proof, we obtain that D(u, t, r) = \u22c3 e\u2208S1 D(u, t, r, e) is countable.\nHere we mention that the narrative of the proof of formula (A.6) in Theorem 5.1 in [14] can be slightly simplified. The detailed operations are performed as follows: replace Lines 1 and 2 from the bottom in Page 82 and Lines 1 and 2 in Page 83 in [14] by\n\u2022 Since 2\u3008a, b\u3009 = \u2016a\u20162 + \u2016b\u20162 \u2212 \u2016a\u2212 b\u20162 for each a, b \u2208 Rm, then\n\u3008e, x\u2212 q\u3009 = \u3008y \u2212 q, x\u2212 q\u3009 \u2016y \u2212 q\u2016 = \u2016x\u2212 q\u20162 + \u2016y \u2212 q\u20162 \u2212 \u2016x\u2212 y\u20162 2\u2016y \u2212 q\u2016\nNote that 2\u3008a, b\u3009 = \u2016a\u20162 + \u2016b\u20162 \u2212 \u2016a\u2212 b\u20162 for each a, b \u2208 l2. So proceed similarly to this slightly simplified proof of Theorem 5.1 in [14], in more detail, replacing Rm by l2, the definition of Qm in Page 82 by l2Q := {(zi) +\u221e i=1 \u2208 l\n2 : zi \u2208 Q for each i \u2208 N}, and Qm by l2Q in this proof, we obtain that D(u) is countable. Here we mention that l2Q is countable. Of course, this fact can also be shown by proceeding similarly to the original proof of Theorem 5.1 in [14].\nThe following Theorem 4.7 is a generalization of Theorem 5.1 in [14] and Theorem 4.6. Its proof is based on the well-known conclusion:\n\u2022 each separable metric space is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Hilbert space l2.\nTheorem 4.7. Let (X, d) be a metric space and u \u2208 F (X). If ([u]0, d) is separable, then the set D(u) is countable.\nProof. Let f be a homeomorphism from ([u]0, d) to a subspace of l 2. Consider uf \u2208 F (l 2) defined by\nuf(t) = { u(f\u22121(t)), t \u2208 f([u]0), 0, t \u2208 l2 \\ f([u]0).\nThen by Theorem 4.6, D(uf) is countable. To show that D(u) is countable, it suffices to show that D(u) = D(uf).\nFor S \u2286 [u]0, let S [u]0 denote the topological closure of S in ([u]0, d).\nFor W \u2286 f([u]0), let W l2 denote the topological closure of W in l2, and let W f([u]0)\ndenote the topological closure of W in f([u]0), here we see f([u]0) as a subspace of l2. As described previously, for S \u2286 X , we use S to denote the topological closure of S in X .\nWe claim that (i) D(u) = {\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) : there exists an x \u2208 {u > 0} such that x \u2208 [u]\u03b1 and x /\u2208 {u > \u03b1}}; (ii) D(uf) = {\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) : there exists a y \u2208 {uf > 0} such that y \u2208 [uf ]\u03b1 and y /\u2208 {uf > \u03b1} l2\n}; (iii) D(uf) = {\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) : there exists an x \u2208 {u > 0} such that f(x) \u2208 [uf ]\u03b1 and f(x) /\u2208 {uf > \u03b1} l2\n}; (iv) Let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] and x \u2208 [u]0. Then (iv-1) x \u2208 [u]\u03b1 \u21d4 f(x) \u2208 [uf ]\u03b1, and (iv-2) x /\u2208 {u > \u03b1} \u21d4 x /\u2208 {u > \u03b1} [u]0 \u21d4 f(x) /\u2208 {uf > \u03b1} f([u]0) \u21d4 f(x) /\u2208 {uf > \u03b1} l2\n. Clearly (i) and (ii) are true. Let y \u2208 l2. Then y \u2208 {uf > 0} if and only if there exists a unique x \u2208 {u > 0} such that y = f(x). So by (ii), (iii) is true.\nNote that for each x \u2208 [u]0, u(x) = uf(f(x)). So (iv-1) is true.\nNow we show (iv-2). Since x \u2208 [u]0, the first \u201c\u21d4\u201d holds. Since f(x) \u2208 f([u]0), the third \u201c\u21d4\u201d holds. Note that f({u > \u03b1}) = {uf > \u03b1}. As f is a homeomorphism from ([u]0, d) to f([u]0), it follows that f({u > \u03b1} [u]0 ) = {uf > \u03b1} f([u]0)\n. Thus the second \u201c\u21d4\u201d holds. So (iv-2) is true. From (i), (iii) and (iv), D(u) = D(uf).\nCorollary 4.8. Let (X, d) be a separable metric space and u \u2208 F (X). Then the set D(u) is countable.\nProof. As ([u]0, d) is a subspace of the separable metric space (X, d), it follows that ([u]0, d) is separable. Thus, by Theorem 4.7, D(u) is countable.\nRemark 4.9. It is well-known that both Rm and l2 are separable metric spaces. Thus both Theorem 5.1 in [14] and Theorem 4.6 are special cases of Corollary 4.8, which is a corollary of Theorem 4.7. So Theorem 4.7 is a generalization of Theorem 5.1 in [14] and Theorem 4.6.\nRemark 4.10. Theorems 4.6, 4.7 and Corollary 4.8 remain true if D(u) is replaced by P (u), since P (u) \u2286 D(u) for each u \u2208 F (X).\nLet u \u2208 F (X). Define F (u) := {\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) : {u > \u03b1} 6= [u]\u03b1}. Clearly (0, 1) \\ F (u) \u2286 (0, 1) \\ D(u); that is, D(u) \u2286 F (u). D(u) $ F (u) may happen. For instance, let u be the fuzzy set defined in Example 4.5. Then F (u) = (0, 1) % {0.6} = D(u).\nFor each u \u2208 F (X), P (u) \u2286 D(u) \u2286 F (u). We claim that if u \u2208 F 1USC(X), then P (u) = D(u) = F (u). Let u \u2208 F 1USC(X). Then for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], {u > \u03b1} \u2286 [u]\u03b1. Thus F (u) \u2286 P (u), and so P (u) = D(u) = F (u).\nTheorem 4.11. Suppose that u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., are fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). Then the following statements are true. (i) If there is a dense set P in (0, 1) such that [u]\u03b1 = lim (K) n\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 P , then u = lim(\u0393)n\u2192\u221e un. (ii) If u = lim(\u0393)n\u2192\u221e un, then [u]\u03b1 = lim (K) n\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P (u).\nProof. The proof of (i) is similar to \u201c(ii) \u21d2 (i)\u201d in the proof of Theorem 6.2 in [14]. Here we mention the following basic facts. Let \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). Then there exist two sequences {\u03b1n} and {\u03b2n} in P with \u03b1n \u2192 \u03b1+ and \u03b2n \u2192 \u03b1\u2212. Indeed, we can get two such sequences by choosing \u03b1n in P\u2229(\u03b1, \u03b1+(1\u2212\u03b1)/n) and \u03b2n in P \u2229 ((1\u2212 1/n)\u03b1, \u03b1) for each n \u2208 N. Let \u03b1 = 1. Then there exists\na sequence {\u03b3n} in P with \u03b3n \u2192 1\u2212. Indeed, we can get a such sequence by choosing \u03b3n in P \u2229 (1\u2212 1/n, 1) for each n \u2208 N.\n(ii) follows immediately from Theorem 4.3.\nThe following theorem gives some conditions under which the \u0393-convergence of fuzzy sets can be decomposed to the Kuratowski convergence of certain \u03b1-cuts. For simplicity, we use \u201ca.e.\u201d to denote \u201calmost everywhere\u201d.\nTheorem 4.12. Suppose that u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., are fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). If ([u]0, d) is separable, then the following are equivalent: (i) lim(\u0393)n\u2192\u221e un = u; (ii) lim(K)n\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1 = [u]\u03b1 holds a.e. on \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1); (iii) lim(K)n\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1 = [u]\u03b1 holds for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P (u); (iv) There is a dense subset P of (0, 1)\\P (u) such that lim(K)n\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1 = [u]\u03b1 holds for \u03b1 \u2208 P ; (v) There is a countable dense subset P of (0, 1)\\P (u) such that lim(K)n\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1 = [u]\u03b1 holds for \u03b1 \u2208 P .\nProof. Suppose that u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., are fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). We claim that (a) (ii)\u21d2(i)\u21d2(iii)\u21d2(iv)\u21d4(v). (b) If (0, 1)\\P (u) is dense in (0, 1), then (i)\u21d4(iii)\u21d4(iv)\u21d4(v). (c) If P (u) is a set of measure zero, then (i)\u21d4(ii)\u21d4(iii)\u21d4(iv)\u21d4(v).\n(ii)\u21d2(i) follows from Theorem 4.11 (i). (i)\u21d2(iii) is Theorem 4.11 (ii). Clearly (iii)\u21d2(iv)\u21d4(v). So (a) is true. If (0, 1)\\P (u) is dense in (0, 1), then a dense subset P of (0, 1)\\P (u) is also a dense subset of (0, 1). So by Theorem 4.11 (i), (iv)\u21d2(i). Combined with (a), we have that (b) is true.\nAssume that P (u) is a set of measure zero. Then (iii)\u21d2(ii). At this time, (0, 1)\\P (u) is dense in (0, 1). So from (a) and (b), we obtain that (c) is true.\nBy Theorem 4.7 and Remark 4.10, we know that if ([u]0, d) is separable, then P (u) is countable, and hence P (u) is a set of measure zero. So by (c), we obtain the desired results.\nRemark 4.13. By Lemma 5.4, if u \u2208 F 1USCG(X) then P (u) = P0(u) is countable. So by affirmation (c) in the proof of Theorem 4.12, Theorem 4.12 remains true if \u201c([u]0, d) is separable\u201d is replaced by \u201cu \u2208 F 1 USCG(X)\u201d.\nHere we mention that the condition \u201cu \u2208 F 1USCG(X)\u201d implies the condition \u201c([u]0, d) is separable\u201d. Let u \u2208 F 1 USCG(X). Then for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], ([u]\u03b1, d) is separable, because each compact metric space is separable. Since\n[u]0 = \u222a +\u221e n=1[u]1/n, it follows that ([u]0, d) is separable (For n = 1, 2, . . ., let\nAn be a countable dense set of ([u]1/n, d). Then \u22c3+\u221e\nn=1An is a countable dense set of ([u]0, d))."

It is shown that under some condition, the Hend metric convergence of fuzzy sets can be decomposed to the Hausdorff metric convergence of certain \u03b1-cuts.\nLet u be a fuzzy set in F 1USC(X). Denote\nP0(u) := (0, 1) \\ {\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) : lim \u03b2\u2192\u03b1 H([u]\u03b2, [u]\u03b1) = 0}.\nIf \u03b1 \u2208 P0(u), then lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1H([u]\u03b2, [u]\u03b1) may not exist. In this paper the lim quantities are allowed to take the value +\u221e.\nProposition 5.1. Let u \u2208 F 1USC(X). Then P (u) \u2286 P0(u).\nProof. If \u03b1 \u2208 P (u), then {u > \u03b1} $ [u]\u03b1, i.e. \u03be := H({u > \u03b1}, [u]\u03b1) > 0. Thus lim\u03b3\u2192\u03b1+ H([u]\u03b3, [u]\u03b1) \u2265 \u03be > 0. Hence \u03b1 \u2208 P0(u). So P (u) \u2286 P0(u).\nP (u) $ P0(u) could happen. See Example 5.2.\nExample 5.2. Let u \u2208 F 1USC(R2) be defined by putting\n[u]\u03b1 = {0} \u222a {z : arg z \u2208 [\u03b1, 1]} for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1],\nhere we write each (x, y) \u2208 R2 as a complex number z = x + iy. Then P (u) = \u2205 and P0(u) = (0, 1). So P (u) $ P0(u).\nThis example also shows that for u \u2208 F 1USC(X), P0(u) need not be countable even X is a separable metric space.\nBelow Lemma 5.3 and Lemma 5.4(i)(ii)(v) may be known. Here we give their proofs for the completeness of this paper.\nLemma 5.3. For n = 1, 2, . . ., let Un \u2208 K(X) and Vn \u2208 K(X). (i) If U1 \u2287 U2 \u2287 . . . \u2287 Un \u2287 . . ., then U = \u22c2+\u221e n=1 Un \u2208 K(X) and H(Un, U)\u2192 0 as n\u2192 +\u221e. (ii) If V1 \u2286 V2 \u2286 . . . \u2286 Vn \u2286 . . . and V = \u22c3+\u221e\nn=1 Vn \u2208 K(X), then H(Vn, V )\u2192 0 as n\u2192 +\u221e.\nProof. Here we give a proof using Theorem 2.3. We only show (ii). (i) can be shown in a similar way. Clearly for n = 1, 2, . . ., Vn \u2208 K(V ). Then by Theorem 2.3, {Vn} has a subsequence {Vnk} which converges to C \u2208 K(V ). Then H(Vn, C) \u2192 0 since for Vnk1 \u2286 Vn \u2286 Vnk2 , H(Vn, C) \u2264 max{H\u2217(Vnk2 , C), H \u2217(C, Vnk1)} = max{H(Vnk2 , C), H(C, Vnk1)}. Thus by Theorem 3.4, C = lim(K)n\u2192\u221e Vn = V . So (ii) is true.\nLemma 5.4. Let u \u2208 F 1USCG(X). (i) For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212 H([u]\u03b2, [u]\u03b1) = 0.\n(ii) For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), lim\u03b3\u2192\u03b1+ H([u]\u03b3, {u > \u03b1}) = 0. (iii) P (u) = P0(u). (iv) P0(u) is countable. (v) If u \u2208 F 1USCB(X), then lim\u03b3\u21920+ H([u]\u03b3, [u]0) = 0.\nProof. Assume that (i) is not true. Then there is an \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], an \u03b5 > 0 and an increasing sequence {\u03b2n} in [0, \u03b1) with \u03b2n \u2192 \u03b1\u2212 such thatH([u]\u03b2n, [u]\u03b1) > \u03b5. By Lemma 5.3 (i), H([u]\u03b2n, [u]\u03b1) \u2192 0. This is a contradiction. So (i) is true. Similarly, by Lemma 5.3 (ii), (ii) and (v) are true.\nNow we show (iii). Given \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P (u). Then [u]\u03b1 = {u > \u03b1} . By (i) and (ii), we have that lim\u03b4\u2192\u03b1 H([u]\u03b4, [u]\u03b1) = 0. Thus \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P0(u). So (0, 1) \\ P (u) \u2286 (0, 1) \\ P0(u). This means that P0(u) \u2286 P (u). Combined with Proposition 5.1, we obtain that P (u) = P0(u). So (iii) is proved.\n(iv) is Lemma 6.12 in [15]. (iv) can also be shown in such a way: let u \u2208 F 1USCG(X), then by Remark 4.13, ([u]0, d) is separable, and thus by Theorem 4.7 and Remark 4.10, P (u) is countable. So by (iii), P0(u) is countable.\nProposition 5.5. (i) If u, v \u2208 F 1USCG(X), then H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) is left-continuous at each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. (ii) If u, v \u2208 F 1USCB(X), then H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) is rightcontinuous at \u03b1 = 0.\nProof. Let u, v \u2208 F 1USCG(X). For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], by Lemma 5.4(i), lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212(H([u]\u03b1, [u]\u03b2)+ H([v]\u03b1, [v]\u03b2)) = 0. Note that H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) is finite at each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1] and for each \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1], |H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1)\u2212H([u]\u03b2, [v]\u03b2)| \u2264 H([u]\u03b1, [u]\u03b2)+H([v]\u03b1, [v]\u03b2). So for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212 H([u]\u03b2, [v]\u03b2) = H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1), and (i) is true. Similarly, it can be shown that (ii) is true by using Lemma 5.4(v).\nProposition 5.6. Let u, v \u2208 F 1USC(X) and \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1]. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1] with \u03b1\u2212 \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b5. If H\u2217(end u, end v) < \u03b5, then H\u2217([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b2) \u2264 H\n\u2217(end u, end v) < \u03b5.\nProof. Set a := H\u2217([u]\u03b1, {v > \u03b2}) and b := sup{d((y, \u03b1), end v) : y \u2208 [u]\u03b1}. We claim the following property (i) if b < \u03b5, then a \u2264 b.\nAssume that b < \u03b5. Let y \u2208 [u]\u03b1. Notice that d((y, \u03b1), end v) = inf{d((y, \u03b1), (z, \u03b3)) : (z, \u03b3) \u2208 end v} \u2264 b < \u03b5, and that for (z, \u03b3) \u2208 end v with \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b2, d((y, \u03b1), (z, \u03b3)) \u2265 |\u03b1\u2212\u03b2| \u2265 \u03b5. Thus d((y, \u03b1), end v) = inf{d((y, \u03b1), (z, \u03b3)) : (z, \u03b3) \u2208 end v with \u03b3 > \u03b2}. Since for each (z, \u03b3) \u2208 end v with \u03b3 > \u03b2, d((y, \u03b1), (z, \u03b3)) \u2265 d(y, z) \u2265 d(y, {v > \u03b2}), it follows that d((y, \u03b1), end v) \u2265 d(y, {v > \u03b2}). Since y \u2208 [u]\u03b1 is arbitrary, we have that a \u2264 b. So (i) is true.\nIf H\u2217(end u, end v) < \u03b5, then b < \u03b5, and hence by (i), H\u2217([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b2) \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 H\u2217(end u, end v) < \u03b5. So the proof is complete.\nTheorem 5.7. Let u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X).\n(i) The following are equivalent: (i-1) limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217(end u, end un) = 0; (i-2) For each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1) and \u03be \u2208 (0, 1\u2212 \u03b1], limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03be, [un]\u03b1) = 0; (i-3) There is a dense subset P of [0, 1) such that for each \u03b1 \u2208 P and \u03be \u2208 (0, 1\u2212 \u03b1], limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03be, [un]\u03b1) = 0. (ii) The following are equivalent:\n(ii-1) limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217(end un, end u) = 0; (ii-2) for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1] and \u03b6 \u2208 (0, \u03b1], limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1\u2212\u03b6) = 0; (ii-3) There is a dense subset P of (0, 1] such that for each \u03b1 \u2208 P and \u03b6 \u2208 (0, \u03b1], limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1\u2212\u03b6) = 0.\nProof. We only prove (i). (ii) can be proved similarly. To show (i-1)\u21d2(i-2), assume that limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217(end u, endun) = 0. Let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1) and \u03be \u2208 (0, 1 \u2212 \u03b1]. Then for each \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03be), there exists an N(\u03b5) such that for all n \u2265 N , H\u2217(end u, end un) < \u03b5, and hence by Proposition 5.6, H\u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03be, [un]\u03b1) < \u03b5. Since \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03be) is arbitrary, it follows that limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03be, [un]\u03b1) = 0. So (i-1)\u21d2(i-2). Assume that (i-2) is true. To show that (i-1) is true, let \u03b5 > 0. Select a k \u2208 N with 1/k \u2264 \u03b5. From (i-2), we have that for l = 1, . . . , k, limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([u]l/k, [un](l\u22121)/k) = 0. So there is an N(\u03b5) such that for all n \u2265 N and l = 1, . . . , k,\nH\u2217([u]l/k, [un](l\u22121)/k) \u2264 \u03b5. (7)\nLet (x, \u03b1) \u2208 end u and n \u2208 N. If \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b5, then d((x, \u03b1), end un) \u2264 d((x, \u03b1), (x, 0)) \u2264 \u03b5. If \u03b1 > \u03b5, then we can choose an l \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1} such that l/k < \u03b1 \u2264 (l + 1)/k, and thus\nd((x, \u03b1), endun) \u2264 d((x, \u03b1), [un](l\u22121)/k \u00d7 {(l \u2212 1)/k})\n= inf{d(x, y) + |\u03b1\u2212 l \u2212 1\nk | : y \u2208 [un](l\u22121)/k} = d(x, [un](l\u22121)/k) + |\u03b1\u2212\nl \u2212 1\nk |.\nSo by (7), for n \u2265 N ,\nH\u2217(end u, end un) \u2264 \u03b5\u2228(max{H \u2217([u]l/k, [un](l\u22121)/k), l = 1, . . . , k\u22121}+2/k) \u2264 3\u03b5.\nSince \u03b5 > 0 is arbitrary, we have that limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217(end u, endun) = 0. So (i-2)\u21d2(i-1). Let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1) and \u03be \u2208 (0, 1\u2212 \u03b1]. Choose \u03b2 \u2208 P \u2229 [\u03b1, \u03b1+ \u03be). Then\nH\u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03be, [un]\u03b1) \u2264 H \u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03be, [un]\u03b2).\nUsing this fact, we obtain that (i-3)\u21d2(i-2). (i-2)\u21d2(i-3) is obvious. Thus (i) is proved.\nRemark 5.8. Let u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). Clearly, (i2) in Theorem 5.7 is equivalent to the following (i-2)\u2032, and (ii-2) in Theorem 5.7 is equivalent to the following (ii-2)\u2032: (i-2)\u2032 For each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1) there is a sequence {\u03bem} in (0, 1\u2212\u03b1] with \u03bem \u2192 0+ satisfying that limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03bem , [un]\u03b1) = 0; (ii-2)\u2032 For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1] there is a sequence {\u03b6m} in (0, \u03b1] with \u03b6m \u2192 0+ satisfying that limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1\u2212\u03b6m) = 0. Similarly, we can give (i-3)\u2032 and (ii-3)\u2032 which are equivalent to (i-3) and\n(ii-3) in Theorem 5.7, respectively.\nCorollary 5.9. Let u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). Then the following are equivalent: (i) limn\u2192\u221eHend(un, u) = 0; (ii) For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03be, [un]\u03b1) = 0 when \u03be \u2208 (0, 1 \u2212 \u03b1], and limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1\u2212\u03b6) = 0 when \u03b6 \u2208 (0, \u03b1]; (iii) There is a dense subset P of (0, 1) such that for each \u03b1 \u2208 P , limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03be, [un]\u03b1) = 0 when \u03be \u2208 (0, 1\u2212 \u03b1], and limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1\u2212\u03b6) = 0 when \u03b6 \u2208 (0, \u03b1].\nProof. Note that limn\u2192\u221eHend(un, u) = 0 if and only if limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217(end u, endun) = 0 and limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217(end un, end u) = 0. So Theorem 5.7 imply that (i)\u21d2(ii) and (iii)\u21d2(i). Clearly (ii)\u21d2(iii). So (i)\u21d4(ii)\u21d4(iii).\nLemma 5.10. Let u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X), and let P be a dense subset of (0, 1). (i) If for each \u03b1 \u2208 P , limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217({u > \u03b1}, [un]\u03b1) = 0, then limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217(end u, end un) =\n0; (ii) If for each \u03b1 \u2208 P , limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) = 0, then limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217(end un, end u) = 0; (iii) If for each \u03b1 \u2208 P , limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217({u > \u03b1}, [un]\u03b1) = 0 and limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) = 0, then limn\u2192\u221eHend(un, u) = 0.\nProof. The desired results follow immediately from Theorem 5.7.\nLemma 5.11. Let u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). (i) Let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1). If limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217(end u, end un) = 0, and lim\u03b3\u2192\u03b1+ H([u]\u03b3, {u > \u03b1}) = 0, then limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217({u > \u03b1}, [un]\u03b1) = 0. (ii) Let \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. If limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217(end un, end u) = 0, and lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212H([u]\u03b1, [u]\u03b2) = 0, then limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) = 0.\nProof. We only prove (i). (ii) can be proved similarly. Let \u03b5 > 0. Since lim\u03b3\u2192\u03b1+H([u]\u03b3, {u > \u03b1}) = 0, then there is a \u03b3(\u03b1) \u2208 (\u03b1, 1] such thatH({u > \u03b1}, [u]\u03b3) < \u03b5/2. By Theorem 5.7 (i), limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217(end u, endun) = 0 implies that limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217([u]\u03b3, [un]\u03b1) = 0. Then there is an N \u2208 N such that for all n \u2265 N , H\u2217([u]\u03b3 , [un]\u03b1) < \u03b5/2. Hence for all n \u2265 N ,\nH\u2217({u > \u03b1}, [un]\u03b1) \u2264 H({u > \u03b1}, [u]\u03b3) +H \u2217([u]\u03b3, [un]\u03b1) < \u03b5.\nFrom the arbitrariness of \u03b5 > 0, we thus have limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217({u > \u03b1}, [un]\u03b1) = 0.\nThe assumption that lim\u03b3\u2192\u03b1+ H([u]\u03b3, {u > \u03b1}) = 0 in (i) of Lemma 5.11 can not be omitted. The assumption that lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212 H([u]\u03b1, [u]\u03b2) = 0 in (ii) of Lemma 5.11 also can not be omitted. The following Examples 5.12 and 5.13 are counterexamples.\nExample 5.12. Let u be a fuzzy set in F 1USC(R) defined by putting\n[u]\u03b1 =\n{ (\u2212\u221e, 2 3\n\u03b1\u2212 1 3\n], \u03b1 \u2208 (1 3 , 1],\n(\u2212\u221e,+\u221e), \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1 3 ].\nFor n = 1, 2, . . ., let un be a fuzzy set in F 1 USC(R) given by putting\n[un]\u03b1 =\n{ (\u2212\u221e, 1\u2212 1 3 n\u22121 n\n\u03b1\u2212 1 3 n\u22121 n\n], \u03b1 \u2208 (1 3 n\u22121 n , 1],\n(\u2212\u221e,+\u221e), \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1 3 n\u22121 n ].\nClearly lim\u03b3\u2192 1 3 + H([u]\u03b3, {u > 1 3 }) = lim\u03b3\u2192 1 3 + H([u]\u03b3, (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e)) = +\u221e 6= 0. It can be seen that Hend(u, un)\u2192 0. However for each n \u2208 N,\nH\u2217({u > 1\n3 }, [un] 1 3 ) = H\u2217([u] 1 3 , [un] 1 3\n) = H\u2217((\u2212\u221e,+\u221e), (\u2212\u221e, 3\u2212 n\u22121 n\n1\u2212 n\u22121 n\n]) = +\u221e,\nand so H\u2217({u > 1 3 }, [un] 1\n3\n) 6\u2192 0.\nExample 5.13. Let u be a fuzzy set in F 1USC(R) defined by putting\n[u]\u03b1 = { {1}, \u03b1 = 1, {1} \u222a (\u2212\u221e,\u2212 1\n1\u2212\u03b1 ], \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1),\nFor n = 1, 2, . . ., let un be a fuzzy set in F 1 USC(R) given by putting\n[un]\u03b1 =\n{ [u]\u03b1, \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1\u2212 1 n ],\n[u]1\u2212 1 n , \u03b1 \u2208 [1\u2212 1 n , 1],\nn = 1, 2, . . . .\nClearly lim\u03b2\u21921\u2212H([u]1, [u]\u03b2) = +\u221e 6= 0. We can see that Hend(u, un)\u2192 0. However for each n \u2208 N,\nH\u2217([un]1, [u]1) = H \u2217({1} \u222a (\u2212\u221e,\u2212n], {1}) = +\u221e,\nand so H\u2217([un]1, [u]1) 6\u2192 0.\nTheorem 5.14. Let u be a fuzzy set in F 1USCG(X) and let un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1USC(X).\n(i) The following are equivalent: (i-1) limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217(end u, end un) = 0; (i-2) For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217({u > \u03b1}, [un]\u03b1) = 0; (i-3) There is a dense subset P of (0, 1) such that for each \u03b1 \u2208 P , limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217({u > \u03b1}, [un]\u03b1) = 0.\n(ii) The following are equivalent: (ii-1) limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217(end un, end u) = 0; (ii-2) For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) = 0; (ii-3) There is a dense subset P of (0, 1] such that for each \u03b1 \u2208 P , limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) = 0.\nProof. The desired results follow from Lemmas 5.4, 5.10 and 5.11 (or Lemmas 5.4 and 5.11 and Theorem 5.7). The proof is routine.\nTheorem 5.15. Let u be a fuzzy set in F 1USCG(X) and let un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1USC(X). Then the following are equivalent: (i) limn\u2192\u221eHend(un, u) = 0; (ii) For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217({u > \u03b1}, [un]\u03b1) = 0 and limn\u2192\u221eH \u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) = 0; (iii) There is a dense subset P of (0, 1) such that for each \u03b1 \u2208 P , limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217({u > \u03b1}, [un]\u03b1) = 0 and limn\u2192\u221eH\n\u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) = 0; (iv) For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P0(u), limn\u2192\u221eH([u]\u03b1, [un]\u03b1) = 0; (v) There is a dense subset P of (0, 1) \\ P0(u) such that for each \u03b1 \u2208 P , limn\u2192\u221eH([u]\u03b1, [un]\u03b1) = 0; (vi) There is a countable dense subset P of (0, 1) \\ P0(u) such that for each \u03b1 \u2208 P , limn\u2192\u221eH([u]\u03b1, [un]\u03b1) = 0; (vii) H([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1)\u2192 0 holds a.e. on \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1).\nProof. By Theorem 5.14, (i)\u21d4(ii)\u21d4(iii). Since for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P0(u), {u > \u03b1} = [u]\u03b1, then (ii)\u21d2(iv). Clearly (iv)\u21d2(v)\u21d4(vi). Since {u > \u03b1} \u2286 [u]\u03b1, (vi)\u21d2(iii). By Lemma 5.4, P0(u) is at most countable, and therefore (iv)\u21d2(vii). Since {u > \u03b1} \u2286 [u]\u03b1, (vii)\u21d2(iii). So the proof is completed.\nThe desired conclusion can also be deduced from Theorems 5.14 and 5.20 as follows. By Theorem 5.14, (i)\u21d4(ii)\u21d4(iii). From Theorem 5.20, (i)\u21d4(iv)\u21d4(v)\u21d4(vi)\u21d4(vii). So Theorem 5.15 is proved.\nTheorem 5.16. Let u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). If there is a dense subset P of (0, 1) such that H([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) \u2192 0 for each \u03b1 \u2208 P , then Hend(un, u)\u2192 0.\nProof. We proceed by contradiction. IfHend(un, u) 6\u2192 0, thenH \u2217(end un, end u) 6\u2192 0 or H\u2217(end u, endun) 6\u2192 0. Suppose that H\u2217(end un, end u) 6\u2192 0. Then there is an \u03b5 > 0 and a subsequence {unk} of {un} such that H \u2217(end unk , end u) > \u03b5 for each k \u2208 N. So for each k \u2208 N, there exists an (xnk , \u03b1nk) \u2208 end unk such that\nd((xnk , \u03b1nk), end u) > \u03b5. (8)\nWith no loss of generality we can assume that {\u03b1nk} converges to an element \u03b1 in [0, 1]. By (8), \u03b1nk > \u03b5 for each k \u2208 N, and so \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b5. Pick \u03b2 \u2208 P satisfying \u03b1 \u2208 (\u03b2, \u03b2+ \u03b5/2). Then there exists K such that \u03b1nk \u2208 (\u03b2, \u03b2+ \u03b5/2) for all k \u2265 K. Thus for each k \u2265 K,\nd((xnk , \u03b1nk), end u)\n\u2264 d((xnk , \u03b2), end u) + d((xnk , \u03b1nk), (xnk , \u03b2)) < d((xnk , \u03b2), [u]\u03b2 \u00d7 {\u03b2}) + \u03b5/2\n= d(xnk , [u]\u03b2) + \u03b5/2 \u2264 H([unk ]\u03b2, [u]\u03b2) + \u03b5/2. (9)\nNote that H([unk ]\u03b2 , [u]\u03b2) \u2192 0, thus (8) contradicts (9). So the supposition is false.\nFor H\u2217(end u, end un) 6\u2192 0, we can similarly derive a contradiction.\nRemark 5.17. It can be seen that Theorem 5.16 can also be deduced from Lemma 5.10 (iii). Fan (Lemma 1 in [6]) proved a result of Theorem 5.16 type.\nTheorem 5.18. Let u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). If Hend(un, u)\u2192 0, then H([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1)\u2192 0 for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P0(u).\nProof. Let \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P0(u). Given \u03b5 > 0. Then there exists a \u03b4(\u03b1, \u03b5) \u2208 (0, \u03b5/2) such that [\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4, \u03b1 + \u03b4] \u2282 [0, 1] and H([u]\u03b2, [u]\u03b1) < \u03b5/2 for all \u03b2 \u2208 [\u03b1\u2212 \u03b4, \u03b1 + \u03b4].\nFrom Hend(un, u)\u2192 0, there exists an N(\u03b4) such that\nHend(un, u) < \u03b4 (10)\nfor all n \u2265 N . Thus by Proposition 5.6, H\u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1\u2212\u03b4) < \u03b4 < \u03b5/2. So, for each n \u2265 N ,\nH\u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1)\n\u2264 H\u2217([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1\u2212\u03b4) +H([u]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1\u2212\u03b4)\n< \u03b5/2 + \u03b5/2 = \u03b5. (11)\nSimilarly, it follows from (10) and Proposition 5.6 thatH\u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03b4, [un]\u03b1) < \u03b4 < \u03b5/2, and then, for each n \u2265 N ,\nH\u2217([u]\u03b1, [un]\u03b1)\n\u2264 H([u]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1+\u03b4) +H \u2217([u]\u03b1+\u03b4, [un]\u03b1)\n< \u03b5/2 + \u03b5/2 = \u03b5. (12)\nCombined with (11) and (12), we obtain that H([u]\u03b1, [un]\u03b1) < \u03b5 for each n \u2265 N . Since \u03b5 > 0 is arbitrary, it follows that H([u]\u03b1, [un]\u03b1)\u2192 0.\nRemark 5.19. Note that for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1)\\P0(u), lim\u03bb\u2192\u03b1H([u]\u03b1, [u]\u03bb) = 0 and [u]\u03b1 = {u > \u03b1}. Thus Theorem 5.18 can also be deduced from Lemma 5.11.\nThe following theorem gives some conditions under which the Hend convergence of fuzzy sets can be decomposed to the Hausdorff metric convergence of certain \u03b1-cuts.\nTheorem 5.20. Let u be a fuzzy set in F 1USCG(X) and let un, n = 1, 2, . . ., be fuzzy sets in F 1USC(X). Then the following are equivalent: (i) Hend(un, u)\u2192 0; (ii) H([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1)\u2192 0 holds a.e. on \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1); (iii) H([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1)\u2192 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P0(u); (iv) There is a dense subset P of (0, 1)\\P0(u) such that H([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) \u2192 0 for \u03b1 \u2208 P ; (v) There is a countable dense subset P of (0, 1)\\P0(u) such that H([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1)\u2192 0 for \u03b1 \u2208 P .\nProof. Suppose that u, un, n = 1, 2, . . ., are fuzzy sets in F 1 USC(X). We claim that (a) (ii)\u21d2(i)\u21d2(iii)\u21d2(iv)\u21d4(v). (b) If (0, 1)\\P0(u) is dense in (0, 1), then (i)\u21d4(iii)\u21d4(iv)\u21d4(v). (c) If P0(u) is a set of measure zero, then (i)\u21d4(ii)\u21d4(iii)\u21d4(iv)\u21d4(v).\n(ii)\u21d2(i) follows from Theorem 5.16. (i)\u21d2(iii) is Theorem 5.18. Clearly (iii)\u21d2(iv)\u21d4(v). So (a) is true. If (0, 1)\\P0(u) is dense in (0, 1), then a dense subset P of (0, 1)\\P0(u) is also a dense subset of (0, 1). So by Theorem 5.16, (iv)\u21d2(i). Combined with (a), we have that (b) is true.\nAssume that P0(u) is a set of measure zero. Then (iii)\u21d2(ii). At this time, (0, 1)\\P0(u) is dense in (0, 1). So from (a) and (b), we obtain that (c) is true.\nBy Lemma 5.4, for each u \u2208 F 1USCG(X), P0(u) is countable, and then P0(u) is a set of measure zero. So by (c), we obtain the desired result.\nRemark 5.21. Clearly, Theorem 5.15 implies Theorem 5.20."

            "text": "USC (X)\nIn this section, we discuss the relation among the Hend metric, the Hsend metric, the d\u221e metric, and the d \u2217 p metric on F 1 USC(X).\nFor u, v \u2208 F 1USC(X), the dp distance given by\ndp(u, v) =\n(\u222b 1\n0\nH([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) p d\u03b1\n)1/p\nis well-defined if and only if H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) is a measurable function of \u03b1 on [0, 1] (here we see H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) as a function of \u03b1 from [0, 1] to R \u222a {+\u221e}). In the sequel, we suppose that the dp distance satisfying p \u2265 1.\nSince H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) could be a non-measurable function of \u03b1 on [0, 1] (see Example 2.13 in [16]), we introduce the d\u2217p distance on F 1 USC(X), p \u2265 1, in [15], which is defined by\nd\u2217p(u, v) := inf{\n(\u222b 1\n0\nf(\u03b1)p d\u03b1 )1/p : f is a measurable function from [0, 1] to R \u222a {+\u221e};\nf(\u03b1) \u2265 H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) for \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] }\nfor u, v \u2208 F 1USC(X). For each u, v \u2208 F 1USC(X), if dp(u, v) is well-defined then clearly d \u2217 p(u, v) = dp(u, v). In [15, 16] and references therein, we have given several conclusions on the well-definedness of the dp distance including: the dp distance is welldefined on F 1USC(Rm), and the dp distance is well-defined on F 1USCG(X).\nLet u, v \u2208 F 1USCG(X). By Proposition 5.5(i), the function H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) of \u03b1 is left-continuous on (0, 1]. So from Proposition 6.1 below, H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) is a measurable function of \u03b1 on [0, 1]. Proposition 6.1 may be known. Here we give a proof for the completeness of this paper. A conclusion stronger than Proposition 6.1 was given in [16] and the references therein.\nProposition 6.1. If a function f : [0, 1]\u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} is left-continuous on (0, 1], then f is a measurable function on [0, 1].\nProof. Let r \u2208 R. Denote the set {x \u2208 [0, 1] : f(x) > r} by {f > r}. If {f > r} \\ {0} = \u2205, then {f > r} \\ {0} is a measurable set. Suppose that {f > r} \\ {0} 6= \u2205. For each x \u2208 {f > r} \\ {0}, let \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x = \u22c3 {[a, b] : x \u2208 [a, b] \u2286 {f > r}\\{0}}. Clearly \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x is an interval. Note that for each interval A with x \u2208 A \u2286 {f > r} \\ {0}, A = \u222a{[a, b] : x \u2208 [a, b] \u2286 A} \u2286 \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x . So \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x\nis the largest interval in {f > r} \\ {0} which contains x. For each x \u2208 X , if \u03b1 \u2208 \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x , then there exists a \u03b4(\u03b1) > 0 with [\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4(\u03b1), \u03b1] \u2286 {f > r} \\ {0} since f is left-continuous at \u03b1. So \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x is a positive length interval. For each x, y \u2208 {f > r} \\ {0}, if \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x \u2229 \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 y 6= \u2205, then \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x \u222a \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 y is an interval with {x, y} \u2282 \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x \u222a \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 y \u2286 {f > r} \\ {0}, and hence \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x = \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 x \u222a \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 y = \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 y .\nThus {f > r} \\ {0} is a union of disjoint positive length intervals. Clearly the set S of all these disjoint positive length intervals is countable (For each B \u2208 S, choose a qB in B \u2229 Q. Then qB1 6= qB2 for each B1 and B2 in S\nwith B1 6= B2. Thus S = {qB : B \u2208 S} \u2264 Q and so S is countable, where C denotes the cardinality of a set C.). So {f > r} \\ {0} is a countable union of intervals and hence is a measurable set. Thus {f > r} is a measurable set as {f > r} = {f > r} \\ {0} or {f > r} = ({f > r} \\ {0})\u222a {0}. Since r \u2208 R is arbitrary, it follows that f is a measurable function on [0, 1].\nd\u2217p is an extended metric but may not be a metric on F 1 USC(X). See also Remark 3.3 in [15]. We can see that the dp distance is a metric on F 1 USCB(X). The dp distance on F 1 USCG(Rm) is an extended metric but not a metric, and the dp distance on F 1 USC(Rm) is an extended metric but not a metric. The dp distance on F 1 USCG(Rm) could take the value +\u221e. Let u \u2208 F 1USCG(Rm) be defined by putting\n[u]\u03b1 = {x \u2208 Rm : \u2016x\u2016 \u2264 n} for each n \u2208 N and \u03b1 \u2208 (1/(n+ 1), 1/n].\nDenote the origin of Rm by o. Then dp(u, o\u0302F (Rm)) = ( \u2211+\u221e n=1 n p \u00b7 (1/n\u22121/(n+ 1)))1/p = +\u221e. For simplicity, in this paper, we call the d\u2217p distance on F 1 USC(X) the d \u2217 p metric, and call the dp distance on F 1 USC(Rm) or F 1USCG(X) the dp metric.\nClearly for u, v \u2208 F 1USC(X),\nd\u221e(u, v) \u2265 d \u2217 p(u, v). (13)\nThe proof of (13) is routine. Set d\u221e(u, v) = \u03be \u2208 R \u222a {+\u221e}. Define f : [0, 1]\u2192 R \u222a {+\u221e} by f(\u03b1) = \u03be for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. Hence f is a measurable function from [0, 1] to R \u222a {+\u221e} and f(\u03b1) \u2265 H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) for \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. So d\u2217p(u, v) \u2264 (\u222b 1 0 f(\u03b1)p d\u03b1 )1/p = \u03be. Thus (13) is true.\nTheorem 6.2. Let u \u2208 F 1USC(X) and for each positive integer n, let un \u2208 F 1USC(X). If d \u2217 p(un, u)\u2192 0, then Hend(un, u)\u2192 0.\nProof. We prove by contradiction. IfHend(un, u) 6\u2192 0, then there is an \u03b5 > 0 and a subsequence {vn} of {un} such that for each n \u2208 N,\nHend(vn, u) \u2265 \u03b5. (14)\nBy (14), for each n \u2208 N, vn 6= u and hence d\u2217p(vn, u) 6= 0. From the definition of d\u2217p, there exists a sequence {fn} of measurable function from [0, 1] to R \u222a {+\u221e} such that for each n \u2208 N,\nH([vn]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) \u2264 fn(\u03b1) for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], (15)\n(\u222b 1\n0\nfn(\u03b1) pd \u03b1 )1/p \u2264 n + 1\nn d\u2217p(vn, u). (16)\nSince d\u2217p(vn, u) \u2192 0, by (16), we have (\u222b 1 0 fn(\u03b1) pd \u03b1 )1/p \u2192 0. Thus there\nis a subsequence {fnk} of {fn} such that {fnk(\u03b1)} converges to 0 a.e. on \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. Hence by (15), H([vnk ]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) \u2192 0 holds a.e. on \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). By Theorem 5.16, this implies Hend(vnk , u)\u2192 0, which contradicts (14).\nTheorem 4.1 in [16] says that for u \u2208 F 1USCG(X) and v \u2208 F 1 USC(X), H([u]\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) is a measurable function of \u03b1 on [0, 1]. So d \u2217 p(u, v) = dp(u, v) for u \u2208 F 1USCG(X) and v \u2208 F 1 USC(X).\nTheorem 6.3. Suppose that u \u2208 F 1USCG(X) and un \u2208 F 1 USC(X), n = 1, 2, . . .,\nand that there is a measurable function F on [0, 1] such that \u222b 1 0 F p(\u03b1) d\u03b1 < +\u221e and H([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) \u2264 F (\u03b1) for n = 1, 2, . . .. If Hend(un, u) \u2192 0, then dp(un, u)\u2192 0.\nProof. By Theorem 5.20, Hend(un, u)\u2192 0 if and only if H([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1)\u2192 0 holds a.e. on \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). So the desired result follows from the Lebesgue\u2019s Dominated Convergence Theorem.\nProposition 6.4. Let u \u2208 F 1USCB(X) and for each positive integer n, let un \u2208 F 1 USC(X). Then Hsend(un, u)\u2192 0 if and only if H([un]0, [u]0)\u2192 0 and dp(un, u)\u2192 0.\nProof. From Proposition 3.3,Hsend(un, u)\u2192 0 if and only ifH([un]0, [u]0)\u2192 0 and Hend(un, u) \u2192 0. To prove the desired result, we only need to show that\nH([un]0, [u]0)\u2192 0 and dp(un, u)\u2192 0\u21d4 H([un]0, [u]0)\u2192 0 and Hend(un, u)\u2192 0.\nFrom Theorem 6.2, \u201c\u21d2\u201d is true. To show \u201c\u21d0\u201d, suppose thatH([un]0, [u]0)\u2192 0 and Hend(un, u) \u2192 0. Then there exists an N \u2208 N such that \u22c3 n>N [un]0 is bounded. Hence there is an M > 0 such that for n \u2265 N and \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], H([un]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) \u2264 d\u221e(un, u) < M . Thus by Theorem 6.3, dp(un, u) \u2192 0. So\u201c\u21d0\u201d is true.\nHowever, for a sequence {un} and an element u in FUSCG(X),Hsend(un, u)\u2192 0 does not necessarily imply dp(un, u)\u2192 0. See the following Example 6.5.\nExample 6.5. Define u \u2208 F 1USCG(R) by putting\n[u]\u03b1 = [0, 1/\u03b1] for \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1].\nFor each n = 1, 2, . . ., define un \u2208 F 1 USCG(R) by putting\n[un]\u03b1 = { [0, 1/\u03b1], \u03b1 \u2208 (1/n, 1], [0, 1\n\u03b1 + n2], \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/n].\nThen Hsend(un, u)\u2192 0 and dp(un, u) = n 2\u22121/p 6\u2192 0.\nIn [15], we obtain that the Skorokhod metric convergence imply the sendograph metric convergence on F 1USC(X) (see Theorem 8.1 in [15]), and that Skorokhod metric convergence need not imply the dp convergence on a subset of F 1USCG(X) (see the end of Section 5 in [15]). From the above conclusions in [15], we can also deduce that the sendograph metric convergence need not imply the dp convergence on F 1 USCG(X)."

In the sequel, we treat (F 1 USCG(X), Hend) as a subspace of (F 1USCG(X\u0303), Hend) by identifying u in F 1 USCG(X) with j(u) in F 1 USCG(X\u0303).\n7.1. Characterizations of compactness in (K(X), H)\nIn this subsection, we give characterizations of total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness in (K(X), H). The results in this subsection are basis for contents in the sequel.\nTheorem 7.1. Let (X, d) be a complete metric space and let {Cn} be a Cauchy sequence in (K(X), H). Put D = \u22c3+\u221e\nn=1Cn. For n = 1, 2, . . ., put Dn = \u22c3n l=1Cl. Then D \u2208 K(X) and H(Dn, D)\u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e.\nProof. Let k, j \u2208 N with k > j. Then H\u2217(Dj , Dk) = 0, and for each i \u2208 N with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j, H\u2217(Ci, Dj) = 0. Thus H(Dk, Dj) = H\u2217(Dk, Dj) = max{H\u2217(Ci, Dj) : i = 1, . . . , k} = max{H\n\u2217(Ci, Dj) : i = j + 1, . . . , k} \u2264 max{H\u2217(Ci, Cj) : i = j + 1, . . . , k}. Hence\nH(Dk, Dj) \u2264 max{H(Ci, Cj) : i = j + 1, . . . , k}.\nSo {Dn} is a Cauchy sequence in (K(X), H).

To prove that D is totally bounded it suffices to show that each sequence in D has a Cauchy subsequence.\nGiven a sequence {xn} in D. Suppose that xn \u2208 Cn \u2208 D for n = 1, 2, . . .. Since D is totally bounded in (K(X), H), then {Cn} has a Cauchy subsequence {Cnk} in (K(X), H). As {Cnk} is also a Cauchy sequence in (K(X\u0303), H), by Theorem 7.1, \u02dc\u22c3+\u221e k=1Cnk is in K(X\u0303). Thus {xnk} has a Cauchy subsequence, and hence so does {xn}.\nSufficiency . If D is totally bounded in X , then D\u0303 is in K(X\u0303). So, by\nTheorem 2.3, (K(D\u0303), H) is compact, and thus D \u2286 K(D\u0303) is totally bounded\nin (K(D\u0303), H). So D is obviously totally bounded in (K(X), H).\nTheorem 7.3. [8] Let (X, d) be a metric space and D \u2286 K(X). Then D is relatively compact in (K(X), H) if and only if D = \u22c3 {C : C \u2208 D} is\nrelatively compact in (X, d).\nProof. If D = \u2205, then the desired result follows immediately. Suppose that D 6= \u2205.\nNecessity . To prove that D is relatively compact it suffices to show that each sequence in D has a convergent subsequence in (X, d).\nGiven a sequence {xn} in D. Suppose that xn \u2208 Cn \u2208 D for n = 1, 2, . . .. Since D is relatively compact in (K(X), H), then {Cn} has a subsequence {Cnk} which converges to an element C in (K(X), H). Clearly {Cnk} converges to C in (K(X\u0303), H). Hence, by Theorem 7.1, \u02dc\u22c3+\u221e k=1Cnk is in K(X\u0303) (Indeed, \u02dc\u22c3+\u221e k=1Cnk is in K(X)). So {xnk} has a subsequence which converges to x in \u02dc\u22c3+\u221e k=1Cnk , and thus x \u2208 C = lim (K) k\u2192\u221eCnk \u2286 X .\nSufficiency . If D is relatively compact in X , then D is in K(X), and therefore (K(D), H) is compact. Thus D \u2286 K(D) is relatively compact in (K(D), H). So clearly D is relatively compact in (K(X), H).\nLemma 7.4. Let (X, d) be a metric space and D \u2286 K(X). If D is compact in (K(X), H), then D = \u22c3 {C : C \u2208 D} is compact in (X, d).\nProof. If D = \u2205, then the desired result follows immediately. Suppose that D 6= \u2205. To show that D is compact, we only need to show that each sequence in D has a subsequence which converges to a point in D.\nGiven a sequence {xn} in D. Suppose that xn \u2208 Cn \u2208 D for n = 1, 2, . . .. Since D is compact, then {Cn} has a subsequence {Cnk} converges to C \u2208 D. Clearly {Cnk} converges to C in (K(X\u0303), H). Hence, by Theorem 7.1, \u02dc\u22c3+\u221e k=1Cnk is in K(X\u0303) (Indeed, \u02dc\u22c3+\u221e k=1Cnk is in K(D)). So {xnk} has a subsequence which converges to x in \u02dc\u22c3+\u221e k=1Cnk . Thus x \u2208 C = lim (K) k\u2192\u221eCnk \u2286 D.\nRemark 7.5. The converse of the implication in Lemma 7.4 does not hold. Let (X, d) = R and D = {[0, x] : x \u2208 (0.3, 1]} \u2282 K(R). Then D = [0, 1] \u2208 K(R). But D is not compact in (K(R), H).\nTheorem 7.6. Let (X, d) be a metric space and D \u2286 K(X). Then the following are equivalent: (i) D is compact in (K(X), H); (ii) D = \u22c3 {C : C \u2208 D} is relatively compact in (X, d) and D is closed in\n(K(X), H); (iii) D = \u22c3 {C : C \u2208 D} is compact in (X, d) and D is closed in (K(X), H).\nProof. Note that D is compact in (K(X), H) if and only if D is relatively compact and closed in (K(X), H). Then from Theorem 7.3 we have (i)\u21d4(ii). Clearly (iii)\u21d2(ii). We shall complete the proof by showing that (i)\u21d2(iii), which can be deduced by Lemma 7.4.\nRemark 7.7. Theorem 7.3 is Proposition 5 in [8]. We cannot find the proof of Proposition 5 in [8]. Some of the results in this subsection may be known. We cannot find the results of this subsection other than Theorem 7.3 in the references that we can obtain. So we give our proofs here.\n7.2. Characterizations of compactness in (F 1USCG(X), Hend)\nIn this subsection, we give characterizations of total boundedness, relative compactness and compactness in (F 1USCG(X), Hend).\nSuppose that U is a subset of F 1USC(X) and \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. For writing convenience, we denote\n\u2022 U(\u03b1) := \u22c3\nu\u2208U [u]\u03b1, and\n\u2022 U\u03b1 := {[u]\u03b1 : u \u2208 U}.\nTheorem 7.8. Let U be a subset of F 1USCG(X). Then U is totally bounded in (F 1USCG(X), Hend) if and only if U(\u03b1) is totally bounded in (X, d) for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1].\nProof. Necessity . Suppose that U is totally bounded in (F 1USCG(X), Hend). Let \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. To show that U(\u03b1) is totally bounded in X , we only need to show that each sequence in U(\u03b1) has a Cauchy subsequence.\nGiven a sequence {xn} \u2282 U(\u03b1). Suppose that xn \u2208 [un]\u03b1, un \u2208 U , n = 1, 2, . . .. Then {un} has a Cauchy subsequence {unl}. So given \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b1), there is a K(\u03b5) \u2208 N such that Hend(unl, unK) < \u03b5 for all l \u2265 K. Thus by Proposition 5.6,\nH\u2217([unl]\u03b1, [unK ]\u03b1\u2212\u03b5) < \u03b5 (17)\nfor all l \u2265 K. From (17) and the arbitrariness of \u03b5, \u22c3+\u221e\nl=1 [unl]\u03b1 is totally bounded in (X, d). Thus {xnl}, which is a subsequence of {xn}, has a Cauchy subsequence, and so does {xn}. In the following, we give a detailed proof for the above conclusion that\u22c3+\u221e l=1 [unl]\u03b1 is totally bounded in (X, d). To show that \u22c3+\u221e l=1 [unl]\u03b1 is totally bounded in (X, d), it suffices to show that for each \u03bb > 0, there exists a finite weak \u03bb-net of \u22c3+\u221e l=1 [unl]\u03b1.\nLet \u03bb > 0. Set \u03b5 = min{\u03bb/2, \u03b1/2}. Then \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b1). Hence there is a K(\u03b5) such that (17) holds for all l \u2265 K. Since \u22c3K l=1[unl]\u03b1\u2212\u03b5 is compact, there is a finite \u03b5 approximation {zj} m j=1 to \u22c3K l=1[unl]\u03b1\u2212\u03b5. We claim that {zj} m j=1 is\na finite weak \u03bb-net of \u22c3+\u221e\nl=1 [unl]\u03b1.\nLet z \u2208 \u22c3+\u221e l=1 [unl]\u03b1. If z \u2208 \u22c3K l=1[unl]\u03b1, then clearly d(z, {zj} m j=1) < \u03b5 < \u03bb.\nIf z \u2208 \u22c3+\u221e\nl=K+1[unl]\u03b1, then by (17), there exists a yz \u2208 [unK ]\u03b1\u2212\u03b5 such that d(z, yz) < \u03b5, and hence d(z, {zj} m j=1) \u2264 d(z, yz) + d(yz, {zj} m j=1) < 2\u03b5 \u2264 \u03bb. Thus d(z, {zj} m j=1) < \u03bb for each z \u2208 \u22c3+\u221e l=1 [unl]\u03b1. So {zj} m j=1 is a finite weak\n\u03bb-net of \u22c3+\u221e\nl=1 [unl]\u03b1.\nSufficiency . Suppose that U(\u03b1) is totally bounded in (X, d) for each \u03b1 \u2208\n(0, 1]. Then U(\u03b1) is relatively compact in (X\u0303, d) for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. So from the sufficiency part of Theorem 7.9, we obtain that U is relatively compact in (F 1USCG(X\u0303), Hend). Then U is totally bounded in (F 1 USCG(X\u0303), Hend), and so U is totally bounded in (F 1USCG(X), Hend).\nTheorem 7.9. Let U be a subset of F 1USCG(X). Then U is relatively compact in (F 1USCG(X), Hend) if and only if U(\u03b1) is relatively compact in (X, d) for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1].\nProof. Necessity . Suppose that U is relatively compact. Given \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. To show that U(\u03b1) is relatively compact in X , we only need to show that each sequence in U(\u03b1) has a convergent subsequence in (X, d).\nLet {xn} be a sequence in U(\u03b1). Suppose that xn \u2208 [un]\u03b1, un \u2208 U , n = 1, 2, . . .. Then there is a subsequence {unk} of {un} and u \u2208 F 1 USCG(X) such that Hend(unk , u) \u2192 0. So, by Theorem 5.20, H([unk ]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) \u2192 0 holds a.e. on \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), and therefore there is a \u03b2 \u2208 (0, \u03b1) such that H([unk ]\u03b2, [u]\u03b2)\u2192 0. Hence by Theorem 7.3, \u22c3+\u221e k=1[unk ]\u03b2 is relatively compact in X . Thus {xnk} has a convergent subsequence in X , and so does {xn}. Sufficiency. Suppose that U(\u03b1) is relatively compact in X for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. Note that U(\u03b1) = \u22c3 {D : D \u2208 U\u03b1} for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. So, by Theorem 7.3, we obtain that U\u03b1 is relatively compact in (K(X), H) for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. This means that the following affirmation (a) is true.\n(a) Given a sequence {wn : n = 1, 2, . . .} in U and \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. Then the corresponding sequence {[wn]\u03b1 : n = 1, 2, . . .} has a convergent subsequence in (K(X), H).\nTo show that U is relatively compact in (F 1USCG(X), Hend), we only need to show that each sequence in U has a convergent subsequence in (F 1USCG(X), Hend). Suppose that {un} is a sequence in U . Based on the above affirmation (a) and Theorem 5.20, and proceeding similarly to the proof of the \u201cSufficiency part\u201d of Theorem 7.1 in [14], it can be shown that {un} has a subsequence {vn} which converges to an element v in (F 1 USCG(X), Hend).\nA sketch of the proof of the existence of {vn} and v is given as follows. First, we construct a subsequence {vn} of {un} such that [vn]q converges to an element uq in (K(X), H) for all q \u2208 Q\u2032, where Q\u2032 = Q \u2229 (0, 1]. For \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], we define v\u03b1 = \u22c2 q<\u03b1,q\u2208Q\u2032 uq. Then we define a fuzzy set v in X by using {v\u03b1, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]}. At last, we show that v \u2208 F 1 USCG(X), [v]\u03b1 = v\u03b1 for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], and Hend(vn, v)\u2192 0.\nTheorem 7.10. Let U be a subset of F 1USCG(X). Then the following are equivalent: (i) U is compact in (F 1USCG(X), Hend); (ii) U(\u03b1) is relatively compact in (X, d) for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1] and U is closed in (F 1USCG(X), Hend); (iii) U(\u03b1) is compact in (X, d) for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1] and U is closed in (F 1USCG(X), Hend).\nProof. By Theorem 7.9, (i)\u21d4 (ii). Obviously (iii)\u21d2 (ii). We shall complete the proof by showing that (i) \u21d2 (iii). To do this, suppose that (i) is true. To verify (iii), from the equivalence of (i) and (ii), we only need to show that U(\u03b1) is closed in (X, d) for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1].\nLet \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1] and let {xn} be a sequence in U(\u03b1) with xn \u2192 x. Suppose that xn \u2208 [un]\u03b1 and un \u2208 U for n = 1, 2, . . .. Then there exists a subsequence {unk} of {un} and u \u2208 U such that Hend(unk , u) \u2192 0. So by Remark 3.5 lim(\u0393)n\u2192\u221e unk = u and therefore by Theorem 4.3, lim supn\u2192\u221e[unk ]\u03b1 \u2286 [u]\u03b1. Hence x \u2208 [u]\u03b1, and thus x \u2208 U(\u03b1).\nWe can also show x \u2208 [u]\u03b1 \u2286 U(\u03b1) in the following way. From Theorem 5.18, H([unk ]\u03b1, [u]\u03b1) \u2192 0 holds for \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P0(u). If \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \\ P0(u), then x \u2208 [u]\u03b1. If \u03b1 \u2208 {1} \u222a P0(u), then for all \u03b2 \u2208 (0, \u03b1) \\ P0(u), x \u2208 [u]\u03b2. Thus x \u2208 [u]\u03b1.\n7.3. Characterizations of compactness in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) and (F 1 USCB(X), Hsend)\nIn this subsection, we give the characterizations of totally bounded sets, relatively compact sets and compact sets in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend). Then, by treating (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) as a subspace of (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend), we give the characterizations of totally bounded sets and compact sets in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend). The characterization of relatively compact sets in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) has already been given in [8].\nSuppose that U is a subset of P 1USC(X) and \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. For writing convenience, we denote\n\u2022 U(\u03b1) := \u22c3\nu\u2208U\u3008u\u3009\u03b1, and\n\u2022 U\u03b1 := {\u3008u\u3009\u03b1 : u \u2208 U}.\nTheorem 7.11. Suppose that U is a subset of P 1USCB(X). Then U is totally bounded in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) if and only if U(0) is totally bounded in (X, d).\nProof. Necessity . Suppose that U is totally bounded. By clause (ii) of Theorem 3.2, U0 is totally bounded in (K(X), H). From Theorem 7.2, this is equivalent to U(0) is totally bounded in (X, d).\nSufficiency . Suppose that U(0) is totally bounded. To show that U is totally bounded in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend), we only need to prove that each sequence in U has a Cauchy subsequence with respect to Hsend.\nLet {un} be a sequence in U . Note that U(\u03b1) is totally bounded for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. Then by Theorem 7.8, {\u2190\u2212un} has a Cauchy subsequence {vn} in (F 1USCB(X), Hend). From Theorem 7.2, {vn} has a subsequence {wn} such that {[wn]0} is a Cauchy sequence in (K(X), H). Thus by clauses (iii) of Theorem 3.2, {wn} is a Cauchy sequence in (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend).\nTheorem 7.12. Suppose that U is a subset of F 1USCB(X). Then U is totally bounded in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) if and only if U(0) is totally bounded in (X, d).\nProof. Note that U is totally bounded in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) if and only if\u2212\u2192 U is totally bounded in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend), and that U(0) = \u2212\u2192 U (0). So the desired result follows from Theorem 7.11.\nTheorem 7.13. Suppose that U is a subset of P 1USCB(X). Then U is relatively compact in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) if and only if U(0) is relatively compact in X.\nProof. Necessity. Suppose that U is relatively compact. Then by clause (ii) of Theorem 3.2, U0 is relatively compact in (K(X), H). By Theorem 7.3, U(0) is relatively compact in X .\nSufficiency . To prove that U is relatively compact, it suffices to show that each sequence in U has a convergent subsequence in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend).\nLet {un} be a sequence in U . Since U(0) is relatively compact in X , then U(\u03b1) is relatively compact in X for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. By Theorems 7.9 and 7.3, there is a subsequence {unk} of {un}, a u \u2208 F 1 USCG(X) and a u0 \u2208 K(X) such that Hend( \u2190\u2212unk , u)\u2192 0 and H(\u3008unk\u30090, u0)\u2192 0.\nBy Theorem 3.4 and Remark 3.5, lim (\u0393) k\u2192\u221e \u2190\u2212unk = u and lim (K) k\u2192\u221e\u3008unk\u30090 =\nu0. By Remark 4.4, [u]0 \u2286 lim infk\u2192\u221e[ \u2190\u2212unk ]0 \u2286 lim infk\u2192\u221e\u3008unk\u30090 = lim (K) k\u2192\u221e\u3008unk\u30090 = u0. So we can define w \u2208 P 1 USCB(X) by putting\n\u3008w\u3009\u03b1 = { [u]\u03b1, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], u0, \u03b1 = 0.\nThen u = \u2190\u2212w , Hend(unk , w) = Hend( \u2190\u2212unk , u) \u2192 0 and H(\u3008unk\u30090, \u3008w\u30090) = H(\u3008unk\u30090, u0) \u2192 0 for n = 1, 2, . . . Thus from (iii) or (iv) of Theorem 3.2, {unk} converges to w in (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend).\n\u2022 u \u2208 F 1USC(X) is said to be right-continuous at 0 if lim\u03b4\u21920+ H([u]\u03b4, [u]0) = 0.\n\u2022 U \u2286 F 1USC(X) is said to be equi-right-continuous at 0 if for each \u03b5 > 0, there is a \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1] such that H([u]\u03b4, [u]0) < \u03b5 for all u \u2208 U .\nLet \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1] and \u03be \u2208 [0, \u03b4]. Then H([u]\u03be, [u]0) = H \u2217([u]0, [u]\u03be) \u2264 H\u2217([u]0, [u]\u03b4) = H([u]\u03b4, [u]0). So U \u2286 F 1 USC(X) is equi-right-continuous at 0 if and only if for each \u03b5 > 0, there is a \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1] such that H([u]\u03be, [u]0) < \u03b5 for all u \u2208 U and \u03be \u2208 [0, \u03b4].\nTheorem 7.14 below is presented in [8].\nTheorem 7.14. [8] Suppose that U is a subset of F 1USCB(X). Then U is relatively compact in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) if and only if U(0) is relatively compact in X and U is equi-right-continuous at 0.\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USCB(X) need not be a closed set of P 1 USCB(X). For instance, F 1 USCB(D) given in Example 8.4 is not a closed set of P 1USCB(D). We can see that\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USCB(X) is a closed set of P 1 USCB(X) if and only if X has only one element.\nFor a set U in F 1USCB(X), suppose that (a) U is relatively compact in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend); (b) \u2212\u2192 U is relatively compact in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend); (c) The topological closure of \u2212\u2192 U in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) is a subset of \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USCB(X).\nThen (a) holds if and only if (b) and (c) hold. \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USCB(X) is closed in P 1 USCB(X) if and only if for each set U in F 1 USCB(X), (c) holds. The following Proposition 7.15 illustrates the role of the condition \u201cU is\nequi-right-continuous at 0\u201d in the characterization of the relative compactness for a set U in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) given in Theorem 7.14.\nProposition 7.15. Let U be a subset of F 1USCB(X). Suppose the following conditions (i), (ii) and (iii): (i) U is relatively compact in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend); (ii) U is equi-right-continuous at 0; (iii) The topological closure of \u2212\u2192 U in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) is a subset of \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USCB(X).\nThen the condition (i) implies the condition (ii), and the condition (ii) implies the condition (iii). If \u2212\u2192 U is relatively compact in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend), then the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) are equivalent to each other.\nProof. By Theorem 7.14, we have that (i)\u21d2(ii).\nNow we show that (ii)\u21d2(iii). Suppose that {\u2212\u2192un} is a sequence in \u2212\u2192 U which converges to an element u in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend). Then by Theorem 3.2(iv), limn\u2192\u221eH(\u3008\n\u2212\u2192un\u30090, \u3008u\u30090) = 0; that is, limn\u2192\u221eH([un]0, \u3008u\u30090) = 0. Let \u03b5 > 0. Since\u2190\u2212u \u2208 F 1USCB(X), by Lemma 5.4(v), lim\u03b1\u21920+ H([ \u2190\u2212u ]\u03b1, [ \u2190\u2212u ]0) =\n0. Note that U is equi-right-continuous at 0. Then there is a \u03b4 > 0 such that for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, \u03b4] and n \u2208 N, H([un]0, [un]\u03b1) \u2264 \u03b5/3 and H([\u2190\u2212u ]\u03b1, [\u2190\u2212u ]0) \u2264 \u03b5/3. By Theorem 3.2(iv), {un} converges to\n\u2190\u2212u in (F 1USCB(X), Hend). Then by Theorem 5.20, H([un]\u03b1, [\n\u2190\u2212u ]\u03b1) \u2192 0 holds a.e. on \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). So we can choose an \u03b10 \u2208 (0, \u03b4) with H([un]\u03b10 , [\n\u2190\u2212u ]\u03b10) \u2192 0. Thus there is an N such that for all n \u2265 N , H([un]\u03b10 , [ \u2190\u2212u ]\u03b10) \u2264 \u03b5/3, and hence H([un]0, [ \u2190\u2212u ]0) \u2264 H([un]0, [un]\u03b10) +H([un]\u03b10 , [ \u2190\u2212u ]\u03b10) +H([ \u2190\u2212u ]\u03b10 , [ \u2190\u2212u ]0 \u2264 \u03b5. Since \u03b5 > 0 is arbitrary, we have limn\u2192\u221eH([un]0, [ \u2190\u2212u ]0) = 0.\nThus \u3008u\u30090 = [ \u2190\u2212u ]0, and hence by Proposition 3.1, u \u2208 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USCB(X). So\n(ii)\u21d2(iii).\nIf \u2212\u2192 U is relatively compact in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend), then clearly (iii)\u21d2(i),\nand thus the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) are equivalent to each other.\nRemark 7.16. For conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) in Proposition 7.15, (ii) does not imply (i); (iii) does not imply (ii).\nLet {un} be a sequence of fuzzy sets in F 1 USCB(R) defined by un := [0, n]F (R), n = 1, 2, . . .. Then {un} is equi-right-continuous at 0 but {un} is not relatively compact in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend). So (ii) does not imply (i).\nLet {vn} be a sequence of fuzzy sets in F 1 USCB(R) defined by\nvn(x) =    1, x \u2208 [0, n], 1/n, x \u2208 [\u2212n, 0], 0, x \u2208 R \\ [\u2212n, n], n = 1, 2, . . . .\nThen {\u2212\u2192vn} has no limit in (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend) and hence is closed in (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend). However {vn} is not equi-right-continuous at 0. So (iii) does not imply (ii).\nRemark 7.17. Theorem 7.13 and Proposition 7.15 imply Theorem 7.14. This is because by Proposition 7.15 we can obtain that for a subset U of\nF 1USCB(X), U is relatively compact in (F 1 USCB(X), Hsend) if and only if\n\u2212\u2192 U is\nrelatively compact in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) and U is equi-right-continuous at 0.\nTheorem 7.18. Suppose that U is a subset of P 1USCB(X). Then the following are equivalent: (i) U is compact in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend); (ii) U is closed in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend), and U(0) is relatively compact in (X, d); (iii) U is closed in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend), and U(0) is compact in (X, d).\nProof. By Theorem 7.13, we obtain that (i)\u21d4(ii). Clearly (iii)\u21d2(ii). We shall complete the proof by showing that (i)\u21d2(iii). To do this, suppose that U is compact in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend). Then U is closed in (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend). To verify (iii), we only need to show that U(0) is compact in (X, d). By clause (ii) of Theorem 3.2, U0 is compact in (K(X), H). Thus by\nLemma 7.4, U(0) = \u22c3 {D : D \u2208 U0} is compact in (X, d).\nTheorem 7.19. Suppose that U is a subset of F 1USCB(X). Then the following are equivalent: (i) U is compact in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend); (ii) U is closed in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend), U(0) is relatively compact in X and U is equi-right-continuous at 0; (iii) U is closed in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend), U(0) is compact in X and U is equiright-continuous at 0.\nProof. By Theorem 7.14, we obtain that (i)\u21d4(ii). Clearly (iii)\u21d2(ii). We shall complete the proof by showing that (i)\u21d2(iii). To do this, suppose that U is compact in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend). Since (i) implies (ii), to verify (iii) we only need to show that U(0) is compact in X .\nNote that U is compact in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) if and only if \u2212\u2192 U is compact in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend). Thus by Theorem 7.18, U(0) = \u2212\u2192 U (0) is compact in X .\nRemark 7.20. For a subset U of F 1USCB(X), (a) U satisfies (i) of Theorem 7.19 if and only if \u2212\u2192 U satisfies (i) of Theorem\n7.18; (b) U satisfies (ii) of Theorem 7.19 if and only if \u2212\u2192 U satisfies (ii) of Theorem\n7.18; (c) U satisfies (iii) of Theorem 7.19 if and only if \u2212\u2192 U satisfies (iii) of Theorem\n7.18. Clauses (b) and (c) can be obtained by using Proposition 7.15 and The-\norem 7.13. Theorem 7.18 and clauses (a), (b) and (c) imply Theorem 7.19.\nSince U is compact in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) if and only if \u2212\u2192 U is compact in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend), we can use Theorem 7.18 to judge the compactness of a set U in (F 1USCB(X), Hsend)."

            "text": "USCB (X),Hsend), (F 1 USCG (X),Hend) and (F 1 USCB (X), d\u221e)\nIn this section, we show that (P 1USCB(X\u0303), Hsend) is a completion of (F 1 USCB(X), Hsend),\n(F 1USCG(X\u0303), Hend) is a completion of (F 1 USCB(X), Hend), and (F 1 USCB(X\u0303), d\u221e) is a completion of (F 1USCB(X), d\u221e). We can see that for x, y \u2208 (X, d),\nd(x, y) = d\u221e(x\u0302, y\u0302) = dp(x\u0302, y\u0302) = Hsend(x\u0302, y\u0302) = Hsend( \u2212\u2192 x\u0302 , \u2212\u2192 y\u0302 ), (18)\nHend( \u2212\u2192 x\u0302 , \u2212\u2192 y\u0302 ) = Hend(x\u0302, y\u0302) = min{d(x, y), 1}. (19)\nTheorem 8.1. Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then the following are equivalent: (i) (X, d) is complete; (ii) (F 1USCG(X), Hend) is complete.\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). Assume that (i) is true. To show that (ii) is true, we only need to show that each Cauchy sequence in (F 1USCG(X), Hend) is a convergent sequence in (F 1USCG(X), Hend). Let {un} be a Cauchy sequence in (F 1USCG(X), Hend). Then U := {un, n = 1, 2, . . .} is total bounded in (F 1USCG(X), Hend). By Theorem 7.8, for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], U(\u03b1) is total bounded in (X, d). Since (X, d) is complete, it follows that for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], U(\u03b1) is relatively compact in (X, d). Thus by Theorem 7.9, U is relatively compact in (F 1USCG(X), Hend). So {un} has a convergent subsequence in (F 1USCG(X), Hend), and thus {un} is convergent in (F 1 USCG(X), Hend). So (ii) is true. (ii) \u21d2 (i). Assume that (ii) is true. Let {xn} be a Cauchy sequence in (X, d). Then by (19), {x\u0302n} is a Cauchy sequence in (F 1 USCG(X), Hend). So {x\u0302n} is a convergent sequence in (F 1 USCG(X), Hend). Hence by Remark 8.2 (i), there exists an x \u2208 X such that Hend(x\u0302n, x\u0302) \u2192 0. Then by (19), d(xn, x) \u2192 0. Thus {xn} is a convergent sequence in (X, d). So (X, d) is complete; that is, (i) is true.\nRemark 8.2. Define X\u0302 := {x\u0302 : x \u2208 X}. Then \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 := { \u2212\u2192 x\u0302 : x \u2208 X}.\n(i) If S satisfies X\u0302 \u2286 S \u2286 F 1USC(X), then X\u0302 is closed in (S,Hend).\n(ii) (i) remains true if Hend is replaced by each one of d\u221e, Hsend and d \u2217 p. (iii) If S satisfies \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 \u2286 S \u2286 P 1USC(X), then \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 is closed in (S,Hsend).\nWe claim that for u \u2208 F 1USC(X), if for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], [u]\u03b1 is a singleton, then u \u2208 X\u0302 . To show u \u2208 X\u0302 , we only need to show that [u]\u03b1 = [u]\u03b2 for all \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1]. This is true since otherwise there exists \u03b1, \u03b2 such that 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b2 \u2264 1 and [u]\u03b1 % [u]\u03b2, which contradicts that [u]\u03b1 and [u]\u03b2 are singletons.\nTo show (i), we only need to show that X\u0302 is closed in (F 1USC(X), Hend). Let x, p, q \u2208 X and \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. Then d((p, \u03b1), end x\u0302) = min{d((p, \u03b1), (x, \u03b1)), \u03b1} = min{d(p, x), \u03b1}. And max{d(p, x), d(q, x)} \u2265 1\n2 d(p, q) since d(p, x)+d(q, x) \u2265\nd(p, q). Given u \u2208 F 1USC(X) \\ X\u0302 . Then there exist p1, q1 \u2208 X and \u03b11 \u2208 (0, 1] such that p1 6= q1 and p1, q1 \u2208 [u]\u03b11 . Thus for each x\u0302 \u2208 X\u0302 , Hend(u, x\u0302) \u2265 max{d((p1, \u03b11), end x\u0302), d((q1, \u03b11), end x\u0302)} = max{min{d(p1, x), \u03b11},min{d(q1, x), \u03b11}} \u2265 min{1 2 d(p1, q1), \u03b11}. This implies that u is not in the closure of X\u0302 in (F 1 USC(X), Hend). Since u \u2208 F 1USC(X) \\ X\u0302 is arbitrary, X\u0302 in closed in (F 1 USC(X), Hend). So (i) is true. By (1), each one of the d\u221e convergence and the Hsend convergence implies the Hend convergence on F 1 USC(X). Theorem 6.2 says that the d \u2217 p convergence implies the Hend convergence on F 1 USC(X). So (ii) follows from (i).\nTo show (iii), we only need to show that \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 is closed in (P 1USC(X), Hsend).\nGiven u \u2208 P 1USC(X) \\ \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 . If u \u2208 P 1USC(X) \\ \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USC(X). Then \u3008u\u30090 has at least two points. If u \u2208 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USC(X) \\ \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 , then there exists \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1] such that \u3008u\u3009\u03b1 has at least two points. So there exist p1, q1 \u2208 X and \u03b11 \u2208 [0, 1] such that p1 6= q1 and p1, q1 \u2208 \u3008u\u3009\u03b11. Thus for each \u2212\u2192 x\u0302 \u2208 \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 , Hsend(u, \u2212\u2192 x\u0302 ) \u2265 max{d((p1, \u03b11), \u2212\u2192 x\u0302 ), d((q1, \u03b11), \u2212\u2192 x\u0302 )} = max{d(p1, x), d(q1, x)} \u2265 1 2 d(p1, q1). This implies that u is not in the closure of \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 in (P 1USC(X), Hsend). Since u \u2208 P 1USC(X) \\ \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 is arbitrary, \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 in closed in (P 1USC(X), Hsend). So (iii) is true. (ii) \u21d2 (i) in Theorem 8.1 can also be shown as follows. (X, d) is complete if and only if (X, d\u2217) is complete, where d\u2217(x, y) = min{d(x, y), 1} for x, y \u2208 X . Note that Hend(x\u0302, y\u0302) = d \u2217(x, y). So the desired result follows from the fact that (X, d\u2217) is isometric to the closed subspace (X\u0302,Hend) of (F 1USCG(X), Hend).\nProposition 8.3. Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then the following are equivalent: (i) (X, d) is complete; (ii) (F 1USCB(X), d\u221e) is complete.\nProof. By (18), (X, d) is isometric to (X\u0302, d\u221e), which by Remark 8.2 (ii) is a closed subspace of (F 1USCB(X), d\u221e). So (ii)\u21d2(i) is proved.\nTo show (i)\u21d2(ii), suppose that (X, d) is complete. Let {un} be a Cauchy sequence in (F 1USCB(X), d\u221e). Then for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], {[un]\u03b1} is a Cauchy sequence in (K(X), H), and hence by Theorem 2.3, there is a u(\u03b1) \u2208 K(X) such that H([un]\u03b1, u(\u03b1))\u2192 0. We have that: (a-1) For 0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1, u(\u03b1) \u2286 u(\u03b2) since by Theorem 3.4, u(\u03b1) = lim(K)n\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b1 \u2286 lim (K) n\u2192\u221e[un]\u03b2 = u(\u03b2); (a-2) limn\u2192\u221e sup\u03b1\u2208[0,1] H([un]\u03b1, u(\u03b1)) = 0; that is, {H([un]\u03b1, u(\u03b1))} converges uniformly to 0 on \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]; (a-3) For each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212H(u(\u03b2), u(\u03b1)) = 0; (a-4) lim\u03b3\u21920+ H(u(\u03b3), u(0)) = 0.\nGiven \u03b5 > 0. As {un} is a Cauchy sequence in (F 1 USCB(X), d\u221e), there is an\nN(\u03b5) \u2208 N such that for all n,m \u2265 N , sup\u03b1\u2208[0,1]H([un]\u03b1, [um]\u03b1) \u2264 \u03b5. Let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] and n \u2265 N . Then for each l \u2208 N, H([un]\u03b1, u(\u03b1)) \u2264 H([un]\u03b1, [un+l]\u03b1) + H([un+l]\u03b1, u(\u03b1)) \u2264 \u03b5+H([un+l]\u03b1, u(\u03b1)). SoH([un]\u03b1, u(\u03b1)) \u2264 \u03b5 as liml\u2192\u221eH([un+l]\u03b1, u(\u03b1)) = 0. As \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] and n \u2265 N are arbitrary, we obtain that sup\u03b1\u2208[0,1]H([un]\u03b1, u(\u03b1)) \u2264 \u03b5 for all n \u2265 N . Since \u03b5 > 0 is arbitrary, we have that (a-2) is true.\nLet \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. Given \u03b5 > 0, by (a-2), there is an N such that for n \u2265 N , sup\u03be\u2208[0,1]H([un]\u03be, u(\u03be)) \u2264 \u03b5/3. By Lemma 5.4(i), lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212 H([uN ]\u03b1, [uN ]\u03b2) = 0. Then there is a \u03b4 > 0 such that for all \u03b2 \u2208 [\u03b1\u2212\u03b4, \u03b1], H([uN ]\u03b1, [uN ]\u03b2) \u2264 \u03b5/3. Thus for all \u03b2 \u2208 [\u03b1\u2212\u03b4, \u03b1],H(u(\u03b1), u(\u03b2)) \u2264 H(u(\u03b1), [uN ]\u03b1)+H([uN ]\u03b1, [uN ]\u03b2)+ H([uN ]\u03b2, u(\u03b2)) \u2264 \u03b5. Since \u03b5 > 0 is arbitrary, it follows that (a-3) is true. Similarly, by using (a-2) and the fact that for n \u2208 N, lim\u03b3\u21920+ H([un]\u03b3 , [un]0) = 0, we can show that (a-4) is true.\nIf there is a u \u2208 F 1USCB(X) such that [u]\u03b1 = u(\u03b1) for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], then by (a-2), d\u221e(un, u)\u2192 0, and so the proof is complete. As {u(\u03b1) : \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]} \u2286 K(X), to prove the existence of a such u \u2208 F 1USCB(X), by Proposition 2.1, we only need to show that {u(\u03b1), \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]} has the following properties: (b) for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], u(\u03b1) = \u22c2 \u03b2<\u03b1 u(\u03b2), and (c) u(0) = \u22c3 \u03b3>0 u(\u03b3).\nBy Remark 3.6 and (a-1), (b) and (c) follow from (a-3) and (a-4), respectively. This completes the proof.\n(b) and (c) can also be shown in the following way. From (a-1), \u22c3\n\u03b3>0 u(\u03b3) \u2286\nu(0) and then \u22c3\n\u03b3>0 u(\u03b3) \u2208 K(X). By Lemma 5.3, for each \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1],\nlim\u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2212 H(u(\u03b2), \u22c2 \u03b2<\u03b1 u(\u03b2)) = 0, and lim\u03b3\u21920+ H(u(\u03b3), \u22c3\n\u03b3>0 u(\u03b3)) = 0 (see the proof of Lemma 5.4(i)(v)). Combined with (a-3) and (a-4), we obtain that (b) and (c) are true.\nEven if (X, d) is complete, (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) need not be complete. See Example 8.4 below.\nExample 8.4. We use \u03c11 to denote the induced metric on {0,1} by the Euclidean metric on R. Let D denote the metric space ({0, 1}, \u03c11). Then D is a subspace of R and D is complete. For n = 1, 2, . . ., let un \u2208 F 1USCB(D) be defined by\nun(x) = { 1, x = 0, 1/n, x = 1.\nDefine u \u2208 P 1USCB(D) \\ \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USCB(D) by putting\n\u3008u\u3009\u03b1 = { {0}, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], {0, 1}, \u03b1 = 0.\nThen {\u2212\u2192un} converges to u in (P 1 USCB(D), Hsend). Thus {un} is a Cauchy sequence in (F 1USCB(D), Hsend) and has no limit in (F 1 USCB(D), Hsend). So (F 1USCB(D), Hsend) is not complete.\nWe can see that (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) is complete if and only if X has only one element.\nTheorem 8.5 below discusses the completeness of (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) and then Theorem 8.6 below gives the completion of (F 1USCB(X), Hsend).\nTheorem 8.5. Let (X, d) be a metric space. Then the following are equivalent: (i) X is complete; (ii) (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) is complete.\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). Let {un} be a Cauchy sequence in (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend). Then {\u2190\u2212un} \u2286 F 1 USCB(X), and by (i) of Theorem 3.2,Hend( \u2190\u2212un, \u2190\u2212um) = Hend(un, um) \u2264 Hsend(un, um) for n,m = 1, 2, . . .. Hence { \u2190\u2212un} is a Cauchy sequence in (F 1USCG(X), Hend). From Theorem 8.1, there is a u \u2208 F 1 USCG(X) such that {\u2190\u2212un} converges to u in (F 1 USCG(X), Hend).\nBy (ii) of Theorem 3.2, H(\u3008un\u30090, \u3008um\u30090) \u2264 Hsend(un, um) for n,m = 1, 2, . . .. So {\u3008un\u30090} is a Cauchy sequence in (K(X), H). From Theorem 2.3, there is a u0 \u2208 K(X) such that {\u3008un\u30090} converges to u0 in (K(X), H).\nBy Theorem 3.4 and Remark 3.5, lim(\u0393)n\u2192\u221e \u2190\u2212un = u and lim (K) n\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090 = u0.\nBy Remark 4.4, [u]0 \u2286 lim infn\u2192\u221e[ \u2190\u2212un]0 \u2286 lim infn\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090 = lim (K) n\u2192\u221e\u3008un\u30090 = u0. So we can define w \u2208 P 1 USCB(X) by putting\n\u3008w\u3009\u03b1 = { [u]\u03b1, \u03b1 > 0, u0, \u03b1 = 0.\nThen u = \u2190\u2212w , Hend(un, w) = Hend( \u2190\u2212un, u) and H(\u3008un\u30090, \u3008w\u30090) = H(\u3008un\u30090, u0) for n = 1, 2, . . . Thus from (iii) or (iv) of Theorem 3.2, {un} converges to w in (P 1USCB(X), Hsend).\n(ii)\u21d2 (i). Note that d(x, y) = Hsend( \u2212\u2192 x\u0302 , \u2212\u2192 y\u0302 ). So the desired result follows from the fact that (X, d) is isometric to( \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 ,Hsend), which by Remark 8.2 (iii) is a closed subspace of (P 1USCB(X), Hsend).\nTheorem 8.6. (P 1USCB(X\u0303), Hsend) is a completion of (F 1 USCB(X), Hsend).\nProof. From Theorem 8.5, (P 1USCB(X\u0303), Hsend) is complete. To show that (P 1USCB(X\u0303), Hsend) is a completion of (F 1 USCB(X), Hsend), we only need to verify that \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USCB(X) is dense in (P 1 USCB(X\u0303), Hsend).\nWe claim the following affirmations (a) and (b):\n(a) For each u \u2208 P 1USCB(X\u0303) and each \u03b5 > 0, there exists a v \u2208 F 1 USCB(X\u0303)\nsuch that Hsend(u, \u2212\u2192v ) \u2264 \u03b5.\n(b) For each v \u2208 F 1USCB(X\u0303) and each \u03b5 > 0, there exists a w \u2208 F 1 USCB(X)\nsuch that d\u221e(v, w) \u2264 \u03b5 (so by (1), Hend(v, w) \u2264 Hsend(v, w) \u2264 \u03b5, and by (13), dp(v, w) = d \u2217 p(v, w) \u2264 \u03b5).\nIf affirmations (a) and (b) are true, then for each u \u2208 P 1USCB(X\u0303) and each\n\u03b5 > 0, there is a v \u2208 F 1USCB(X\u0303) and w \u2208 F 1 USCB(X) such that Hsend(u, \u2212\u2192v ) \u2264 \u03b5/2 andHsend( \u2212\u2192v ,\u2212\u2192w ) = Hsend(v, w) \u2264 \u03b5/2. ThusHsend(u, \u2212\u2192w ) \u2264 Hsend(u, \u2212\u2192v )+ Hsend( \u2212\u2192v ,\u2212\u2192w ) \u2264 \u03b5. So for each u \u2208 P 1USCB(X\u0303) and each \u03b5 > 0, there is a w \u2208 F 1USCB(X) such that Hsend(u, \u2212\u2192w ) \u2264 \u03b5. This means that \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 F 1USCB(X) is dense in (P 1USCB(X\u0303), Hsend). So to show the desired result, it suffices to prove affirmations (a) and (b).\nLet u \u2208 P 1USCB(X\u0303) and \u03b5 > 0. Define u\u03b5 \u2208 F 1 USCB(X\u0303) by putting\n[u\u03b5]\u03b1 = { \u3008u\u3009\u03b1, \u03b1 \u2208 (\u03b5, 1], \u3008u\u30090, \u03b1 \u2208 [0, \u03b5].\nThen Hsend(u, \u2212\u2192u\u03b5) \u2264 \u03b5. So affirmation (a) is proved.\nLet v \u2208 F 1USCB(X\u0303) and \u03b5 > 0. We can choose a finite subset C0 of X such thatH(C0, [v]0) < \u03b5 as follows. Since [v]0 \u2208 K(X\u0303), there is a finite subset A of\n[v]0 such thatH(A, [v]0) < \u03b5/2. AsX is dense in (X\u0303, d\u0303), there is a subset C0 of X such that H(C0, A) < \u03b5/2. Thus H(C0, [v]0) \u2264 H(C0, A)+H(A, [v]0) < \u03b5.\nDefine C\u03b1 := {x \u2208 C0 : d(x, [v]\u03b1) \u2264 \u03b5}, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]. (20)\nWe affirm that {C\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]} has the following properties (i) C\u03b1 6= \u2205 for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. (ii) H(C\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) \u2264 \u03b5 for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. (iii) C\u03b1 = \u22c2 \u03b2<\u03b1C\u03b2 for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1].\n(iv) C0 = \u22c3 \u03b1>0C\u03b1 = \u22c3\n\u03b1>0C\u03b1. For each y \u2208 [v]\u03b1, there exists zy \u2208 C0 such that d(y, zy) = d(y, C0) < \u03b5. Hence zy \u2208 C\u03b1 and thus C\u03b1 6= \u2205. So (i) is true. To show (ii), let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. If \u03b1 = 0, then (ii) is true since H(C0, [v]0) < \u03b5. Assume that 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1. From (20), H\u2217(C\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) \u2264 \u03b5. So to show H(C\u03b1, [v]\u03b1) \u2264 \u03b5, it suffices to show that H\n\u2217([v]\u03b1, C\u03b1) < \u03b5. Let y \u2208 [v]\u03b1. From d(y, zy) \u2265 d(y, C\u03b1) \u2265 d(y, C0) and d(y, zy) = d(y, C0),\nwe have that d(y, zy) = d(y, C\u03b1) = d(y, C0). Thus\nH\u2217([v]\u03b1, C\u03b1) = sup y\u2208[v]\u03b1 d(y, C\u03b1) = sup y\u2208[v]\u03b1 d(y, C0) \u2264 sup y\u2208[v]0 d(y, C0) = H \u2217([v]0, C0) \u2264 H(C0, [v]0) < \u03b5.\nSo (ii) is proved. To show (iii), let \u03b10 \u2208 (0, 1]. From the definition of {C\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]}, we\ncan see that C\u03be \u2286 C\u03b7 for 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 1. Thus C\u03b10 \u2286 \u22c2 \u03b2<\u03b10 C\u03b2.\nBy Lemma 5.4 (i), lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b10\u2212 H([v]\u03b10, [v]\u03b2) = 0. Note that for each x \u2208 X and \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 [0, 1], |d(x, [v]\u03be)\u2212 d(x, [v]\u03b7)| \u2264 H([v]\u03be, [v]\u03b7). Thus for each x \u2208 X , d(x, [v]\u03b10) = lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b10\u2212 d(x, [v]\u03b2). Let x \u2208 \u22c2 \u03b2<\u03b10\nC\u03b2. Then d(x, [v]\u03b10) = lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b10\u2212 d(x, [v]\u03b2) \u2264 \u03b5, which means that x \u2208 C\u03b10 . Since x \u2208 \u22c2 \u03b2<\u03b10\nC\u03b2 is arbitrary, we have \u22c2 \u03b2<\u03b10 C\u03b2 \u2286 C\u03b10 . Hence C\u03b10 = \u22c2 \u03b2<\u03b10 C\u03b2. So (iii) is true.\nSince C\u03b1 \u2286 C0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] and C0 is finite, it follows that \u22c3\n\u03b1>0C\u03b1 =\u22c3 \u03b1>0C\u03b1 \u2286 C0. So to show (iv), we only need to show that C0 \u2286 \u22c3 \u03b1>0C\u03b1.\nSince [v]0 = \u222a\u03b1>0[v]\u03b1, it follows that for each x \u2208 X , d(x, [v]0) = d(x,\u222a\u03b1>0[v]\u03b1) = inf\u03b1>0 d(x, [v]\u03b1). Let x \u2208 C0. Then d(x, [v]0) < \u03b5. So there exists \u03b1 > 0 such that d(x, [v]\u03b1) < \u03b5, which means that x \u2208 C\u03b1. Thus C0 \u2286 \u22c3 \u03b1>0C\u03b1 and (iv) is proved.\nNow, define w \u2208 F (X) by putting [w]\u03b1 = C\u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. Then by (i), (iii) and (iv), w \u2208 F 1USCB(X). From (ii), we have d\u221e(v, w) \u2264 \u03b5, and then affirmation (b) is proved. This completes the proof.\nProposition 8.7. (F 1USCB(X\u0303), d\u221e) is a completion of (F 1 USCB(X), d\u221e).\nProof. By Proposition 8.3, (F 1USCB(X\u0303), d\u221e) is complete. So from affirmation (b) in the proof of Theorem 8.6, we have the desired result.\nCorollary 8.8. (P 1USCB(X\u0303), Hsend) is a completion of (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend).\nProof. Note that (F 1USCB(X), Hsend) can be seen as a subspace of (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend), and (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) is a subspace of (P 1 USCB(X\u0303), Hsend). So the desired result follows from Theorem 8.6.\nTheorem 8.9. (F 1USCG(X\u0303), Hend) is a completion of (F 1 USCB(X), Hend).\nProof. From Theorem 8.1, (F 1USCG(X\u0303), Hend) is complete. To prove the desired result, it suffices to show that F 1USCB(X) is dense in (F 1 USCG(X\u0303), Hend). By affirmation (b) in the proof of Theorem 8.6, to verify this it is enough to\nshow that for each u \u2208 F 1USCG(X\u0303) and each \u03b5 > 0, there is a v \u2208 F 1 USCB(X\u0303) such that Hend(u, v) \u2264 \u03b5.\nLet u \u2208 F 1USCG(X\u0303) and \u03b5 > 0. Define u \u03b5 \u2208 F 1USCB(X\u0303) by putting\n[u\u03b5]\u03b1 = { [u]\u03b1, \u03b1 \u2208 (\u03b5, 1], [u]\u03b5, \u03b1 \u2208 [0, \u03b5].\nThen Hend(u, u \u03b5) \u2264 \u03b5.\nCorollary 8.10. (F 1USCG(X\u0303), Hend) is a completion of (F 1 USCG(X), Hend).\nProof. Since F 1USCB(X) \u2286 F 1 USCG(X) \u2286 F 1 USCG(X\u0303), the desired result follows from Theorem 8.9.\nRemark 8.11. If X is complete, then by Theorem 8.6, (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) is a completion of (F 1USCB(X), Hsend), and thus (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend) is complete. So Theorem 8.6 implies that (P 1USCB(X), Hsend) is complete when X is complete. Similarly, Proposition 8.7 implies that (F 1USCB(X), d\u221e) is complete when X is complete. Theorem 8.9 implies that (F 1USCG(X), Hend) is complete when X is complete."

We define the Hsend distance and the Hend distance on P 1 USC(X), and give the relations among the Hsend distance, the Hend distance and the Kuratowski convergence on P 1USC(X). Then, as corollaries, we obtain the relations among the Hsend metric, the Hend metric and the \u0393-convergence on F 1 USC(X).\nWe give the level characterizations ofHend convergence and \u0393-convergence on F 1USC(X). By using the above results including the level characterizations of the Hend convergence, we give the relations among the Hend metric, the Hsend metric and the d \u2217 p metric.\nBased on above results, we give characterizations of compactness and completions of two kinds of fuzzy set spaces (F 1USCG(X), Hend) and (F 1 USCB(X), Hsend), respectively. We also investigate characterizations of compactness and completions of (P 1USCB(X), Hsend). (F 1 USCB(X), Hsend) can be treated as a subspace of (P 1USCB(X), Hsend). Note that Rm is complete and for a set V in Rm, the following are equiv-\nalent: (i) V is bounded; (ii) V is totally bounded; (iii) V is relatively compact. We can obtain the characterizations of compactness and completions of (F 1USCB(Rm), Hsend), (F 1USCG(Rm), Hend) and (P 1USCB(Rm), Hsend) by using that of (F 1USCB(X), Hsend), (F 1 USCG(X), Hend) and (P 1 USCB(X), Hsend) given in this paper.
