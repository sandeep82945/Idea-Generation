However, the precise mechanism 15 underlying SARPs' transcriptional activation remains elusive. Here, we used cryo-electron 16 microscopy (cryo-EM) to unravel the interplay between SARP, DNA, and RNA polymerase 17 (RNAP) during transcriptional activation. The SARP domain of Streptomyces coelicolor AfsR 18 (SAS) forms a side-by-side dimer contacting the afs box centered at \u221229.5 relative to the 19 transcription start site. The upstream protomer binds to the direct repeat encompassing the \u221235 20 element while the \u03c3HrdB region 4 (R4) is positioned on top of both protomers, causing the removal 21 of R4 from the major groove of the \u221235 element. Both SAS protomers establish interactions with 22 C-terminal domain of one RNAP \u03b1 subunits, while specific regions of the RNAP \u03b2 flap tip helix 23 and \u03b2' zinc-binding domain also engage with SAS. Key interfacial residues accounting for 24 transcriptional activation were confirmed by mutational studies and in vitro transcriptional assays. 25 Overall, our results present a detailed molecular view of how SARPs serve to activate transcription. 26",

Here, we used cryo-electron 16 microscopy (cryo-EM) to unravel the interplay between SARP, DNA, and RNA polymerase 17 (RNAP) during transcriptional activation. The SARP domain of Streptomyces coelicolor AfsR 18 (SAS) forms a side-by-side dimer contacting the afs box centered at \u221229.5 relative to the 19 transcription start site. The upstream protomer binds to the direct repeat encompassing the \u221235 20 element while the \u03c3HrdB region 4 (R4) is positioned on top of both protomers, causing the removal 21 of R4 from the major groove of the \u221235 element. Both SAS protomers establish interactions with 22 C-terminal domain of one RNAP \u03b1 subunits, while specific regions of the RNAP \u03b2 flap tip helix 23 and \u03b2' zinc-binding domain also engage with SAS.

Introduction 32 Streptomycetes are multicellular bacteria with a complex developmental cycle(1). They 33 produce numerous bioactive natural products, including many antibiotics with important 34 applications in medicine and agriculture. Genome analyses of streptomycetes in recent years 35 have revealed their substantial biosynthetic potential. This capability makes streptomycetes 36 one of the most important industrial microbial genera. Complex regulatory systems tightly 37 govern the natural product biosynthesis of streptomycetes, involving both global and 38 pathway-specific regulators. Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family 39 regulators are prominent initiators and activators of natural product biosynthesis, and have 40 mainly been found in actinomycetes(2). Recently reported members of the SARP family 41 include ChlF2 from Streptomyces antibioticus and MilR3 from Streptomyces 42 bingchenggensis. ChlF2 activates the production of chlorothricin, known for its anti-43 inflammatory properties, and MilR3 stimulates the synthesis of an excellent insecticide 44 milbemycin (3, 4). SARP regulators exhibit a comparable protein architecture and binding 45 affinity towards similar recognition sequences (5). These regulators feature an N-terminal 46 OmpR-type DNA-binding (ODB) domain and a C-terminal bacterial transcriptional 47 activation (BTA) domain, collectively referred to as the SARP domain. The ODB domain 48 is characterized by a winged helix-turn-helix (HTH) comprising three \u03b1-helices and two 49 antiparallel \u03b2-sheets(6), whereas the BTA domain is all-helical(7). In contrast to \u201csmall\u201d 50 SARPs that only contain a SARP domain, \u201clarge\u201d SARPs possess extra domains at their C-51 terminals that are hypothesized to modulate the activity of the SARP domain (Fig. 1A). 52 \"Small\" SARPs are more frequently observed and extensively studied among actinomycetes, 53 compared to their \"large\" counterparts (8). 54\n55 Streptomyces coelicolor AfsR (ScAfsR) is a pleiotropic, global regulator of secondary 56 metabolism belonging to the \u201clarge\u201d SARP group, containing a SARP (Met1-Ala270) 57 domain, a conserved ~35-kDa dubbed nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 58 (Ala271 to Glu618), an arm domain (Arg619-Glu777) as well as a tetratrico-peptide repeats 59 (TPR) sensor domain (Asp778-Arg993) (9) (Fig. 1A). It activates afsS transcription by 60 binding to the promoter(10, 11). AfsS is a master regulator of both secondary metabolism 61 and nutritional stress response(12). It was presumed that upon binding of AfsR to a 22-base 62 pair (bp) binding box (afs box), RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme is recruited to the 63\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Additionally, ScAfsR also binds to promoters of PhoR-PhoP regulon members 65 such as pstS, phoRP and glnR, controlling the response to phosphate and nitrogen scarcity 66 (13, 14) (Fig. 1B). In vitro, a truncated ScAfsR protein containing only the SARP domain 67 (SAS) recognizes the afsS promoter and activates its transcription as the full-length AfsR 68 does, suggesting that the DNA-binding specificity of AfsR and its capability to activate afsS 69 promoter are determined solely by SAS (9). However, the detailed mechanism mediating 70 SAS-dependent transcription activation is still obscure. 71\n72 The RNAP holoenzyme consists of a dissociable \u03c3 subunit that establishes specific 73 interactions with the \u221235 and \u221210 elements of the promoter in order to initiate transcription. 74 The positioning of RNAP is primarily influenced by the contacts between \u03c3 region 4 (R4) 75 and the \u221235 element, while the formation of an open complex is driven by the contacts 76 between \u03c3 region 2 (R2) and the \u221210 element(15, 16). The afsS promoter comprises a 77 consensus \u221210 element (CACTGT) but a suboptimal \u221235 element (TTCAGC). This 78 characteristic is commonly observed in streptomycete promoters (17, 18), which 79 complicates the identification of the \u221235 elements. The 22-bp afs box, centered at position 80 \u221229.5 relative to the transcription start site in the afsS promoter, overlaps with the spacer 81 between the \u221210 and \u221235 elements. It is composed of two 11-bp direct repeats (DRs), with 82 the upstream DR (\u221240 to \u221230) overlapping with the \u221235 element (\u221238 to \u221233)(19, 20). The 83 catabolite activator protein (CAP), also known as the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), is an 84 extensively studied transcription factor. The 22-bp CAP binding box (cap box) is centered 85 at \u201361.5 in class I promoters and at \u201341.5 in class II promoters(21-23). The binding position 86 of SAS suggests that it may possess a distinct activation mechanism. 87\n88 Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize a SAS-transcription 89 initiation complex (TIC) and to provide a transcription-activating mechanism that could be 90 generally used by SARP family activators. 91\n92\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

            "text": "ScAfsR, a prominent global regulator of secondary metabolism, possesses a widely 95 distributed SARP domain in all actinomycetes, enabling the activation of antibiotic 96 synthesis gene clusters. This characteristic has sparked interest in the function of ScAfsR, 97 with particular emphasis on its SARP domain, namely SAS. In vitro MangoIII-based 98 transcription assays demonstrated that SAS enhances transcription of afsS promoter (Fig. 99 1C), in agreement with the previous report (9). A 32 bp DNA probe (\u221245 to \u221214) containing 100 the afs box (\u221219 to \u221240) was used for the fluorescence polarization assays of SAS, in which 101 an average dissociation constant kD-ave of 89.5 \u00b1 16.0 nM was obtained (Fig. 1D). SAS 102 purified to homogeneity was directly used to assemble the activator-TIC (Fig. S1). A DNA 103 scaffold is engineered from the afsS promoter, consisting of a 44-bp (\u221250 to \u22127) upstream 104 promoter double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) which contains the 22-bp afs box and the 105 consensus \u201310 element, a 6-bp (\u22126 to \u22121) non-complementary transcription bubble, and a 106 15-bp (+1 to +15) downstream promoter dsDNA (Fig. 1F). RbpA and CarD, two RNAP-107 binding proteins discovered in actinobacteria, can stabilize the TIC and have been found in 108 many TIC structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (24-26). Therefore, we combined SAS, 109 the DNA scaffold, RbpA, CarD, and RNAP \u03c3HrdB-holoenzyme, and subsequently separated 110 the TIC complex using size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1E). Through in vitro 111 transcription assays, we observed that the presence of CarD and RbpA during the 112 transcription of the afsS promoter yielded results almost the same as those achieved with 113 the RNAP holo-enzyme alone. Furthermore, SAS maintained its role as a transcriptional 114 activator in the presence of RbpA and CarD (Fig. S2). 115\n116 The final cryo-EM map of the SAS-TIC was reconstructed using a total of 95223 single 117 particles and refined to a nominal resolution of 3.35 \u00c5, with ~3 \u00c5 at the center of RNAP 118 and ~6 \u00c5 at the peripheral SAS (Fig. S3). Local refinement focused on the SAS region 119 generated a 3.77-\u00c5-resolution map. In the cryo-EM maps, the densities allowed 120 unambiguous docking of two SAS protomers, a 61-bp promoter DNA (\u221246 to +15), a \u03c3HrdB 121 subunit except disordered region 1.1, five subunits of RNAP core (\u03b12\u03b2\u03b2\u2032\u03c9), RbpA and CarD. 122 In addition, the cryo-EM density map shows a clear signal for an \u03b1CTD (Fig. 1G). The two 123 SAS protomers simultaneously engage the afs box and RNAP \u03c3HrdB-holoenzyme. The 124 overall structure of S. coelicolor RNAP in SAS-TIC closely resembles that in our recently 125 reported S. coelicolor RNAP\u03c3HrdB-Zur-DNA structure (PDB ID: 7X75, rmsd of 0.334 \u00c5 for 126\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

CarD binds the \u03b2-subunit and interacts with the 133 upstream double-stranded/single-stranded (ds/ss) junction of the transcription bubble (31), 134 while RbpA enhances interactions between \u03b2\u2019, \u03c3HrdB and promoter DNA(32). 135\n136 Interactions between SAS and afs box 137 The SAS-TIC structure elucidates the binding interactions between SAS protomers and two 138 major grooves of the afs box, with each protomer making contacts with one DR (Fig. 2A). 139 The contacts span the first eight conserved base pairs. In contrast, the last 3 base pairs don\u2019t 140 make any contact with SAS (Fig. 2B). Overall conformations of the two protomers are 141 essentially the same with an overall rmsd of 0.4 \u00c5. A dimer interface of ~1120 \u00c52 is formed 142 between the two SAS protomers, revealing a unique side-by-side arrangement (Fig. 2C). 143 Consistent with the previous report (9), size exclusion chromatography showed that SAS is 144 monomeric in solution (Fig. S1B). This suggests that the dimerization of SAS is occurred 145 specifically upon DNA binding. As a representative example of SARP family transcription 146 activators, the SAS folds into an N-terminal ODB domain (residues 25-111) and a C-147 terminal BTA domain (residues 120-270) (Fig. 2D). The ODB domain consists of three \u03b1 148 helices packed against two antiparallel \u03b2 sheets. Two helices, \u03b12 and \u03b13, and the seven-149 residue connecting loop constitute an HTH DNA-binding motif, followed by a \u03b2 hairpin 150 that contacts the strand between the helices \u03b11 and \u03b12. The BTA domain comprises seven 151 \u03b1-helices, of which the first three ones stand on the first \u03b2 sheet and the first two helices of 152\nthe N-terminal ODB domain, burying an interfacial area of \u223c860 \u00c52. The overall structure 153 of SAS protomers closely resembles EmbR (PDB ID: 2FEZ, rmsd of 2.8 \u00c5 for 247 aligned 154 C\u03b1 atoms) (7), a transcriptional regulator of M. tuberculosis, except that EmbR comprises 155 an additional C-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain (Fig. S5). 156\n157 The two SAS protomers establish a total contact surface of ~1300 \u00c52 with the dsDNA, 158 resulting in a 20\u00b0 bend of the helical axis of the upstream dsDNA at T-30(nt) (-30T on the 159 non-template strand) (Fig. S6). The two ODB domains make similar contacts with DNA, 160\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The DNA contacts made 161 by the upstream SAS protomer were described in the following section (Fig. 2E). The N-162 terminal end of helix \u03b11, the C-terminal end of helix \u03b12, and the HTH loop make extensive 163 contacts with the backbone phosphate groups from C-40 to T-37 of the nt-strand, involving 164 both hydrogen bonds (S46 and Q48) and van der Waals interactions (W74, P79, S80 and 165 Q81). The recognition helix \u03b13 penetrates the DNA major groove and is almost 166 perpendicular to the DNA axis. R87, R94 and K95 form salt bridges with the backbone 167 phosphate groups from T\u221235 to G-33 of the t-strand. The side chain of S91 makes a hydrogen 168 bond with the phosphate group of T\u221235(t). In addition to these nonspecific contacts with 169 backbone phosphate groups, the recognition helix \u03b13 also establishes specific DNA contacts 170 (Fig. 2F). The R92 makes hydrogen bonds with the O4 atom of T-38(nt) via its guanidinium 171 group. The side chain of T88 makes a hydrogen bond with N7 of G-36(t). Consistent with 172 the structural observations, previous EMSAs show that changing the T-38(nt) of the 173 upstream DR or the corresponding T-27(nt) of the downstream DR to adenosine prevents the 174 binding of ScAfsR (20). However, changing the G-36(t) to adenosine doesn\u2019t impair the 175 binding of ScAfsR since A-25(t) is observed at the corresponding position of the downstream 176 DR (20). Most residues involved in DNA interactions are highly conserved in both \"small\" 177 and \"large\" SARP homologues across various Streptomyces strains (Fig. 2G), including 178 Q48, W74, P79, T88, R94, and K95. 179\n180 SAS engages with \u03c3HrdB R4, \u03b2 FTH, and \u03b2\u2019 ZBD 181 Both SAS protomers make contacts with \u03c3HrdB R4, burying a total interface of 800 \u00c52 (Fig. 182 3A). The upstream protomer contacts \u03c3HrdB R4 by its ODB domain, of which the HTH forms 183 a concave surface at the N-terminal of the helix \u03b13 to enfold the N-terminal of the helix \u03b14 184 of \u03c3HrdB R4. The negatively charged residues E76 and E77 in the loop connecting helices \u03b12 185 and \u03b13, and the residues E68 and D71 in helix \u03b12 of the ODB domain form salt bridges with 186 R485 and R487 in \u03c3HrdB R4, respectively (Fig. 3B). The interface where the shape and 187 charge complement each other buries an area of ~320 \u00c52. The downstream protomer mainly 188 uses its BTA domain to contact \u03c3HrdB R4, with a buried surface area of ~480 \u00c52 (Fig. 3C). 189 The helices \u03b13 to \u03b17 of the downstream BTA domain form a \u201cchair\u201d to let \u03c3HrdB R4 sit on 190 it. The C-terminal of helix \u03b14, the N-terminal of helix \u03b15 and the connecting turn of \u03c3HrdB 191 R4 fit in a groove formed by helices \u03b13 to \u03b17 of the BTA domain. The R498 at the C-192 terminal of helix \u03b14 of \u03c3HrdB R4 makes contacts with the E176 and V172 on the \u201cchair back\u201d. 193 The H499 in the connecting turn of \u03c3HrdB R4 is enfolded in an amphiphilic pocket formed 194\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The K496 at the 195 C-terminal of helix \u03b14 of \u03c3HrdB R4 makes a salt bridge with the E246 at the C-terminal of 196 helix \u03b16 of the BTA domain. In addition, the HTH loop of the ODB domain forms 197 interactions with the loop connecting helices \u03b12 and \u03b13 of \u03c3HrdB R4. 198\n199 The downstream protomer also interacts with the RNAP \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2019 subunits. The ODB 200 domain contacts the \u03b2-flap tip helix (FTH), the preceding loop (TPL) and the following loop 201 (TFL) of the \u03b2 flap by the helices \u03b11 and \u03b22, and the second antiparallel \u03b2 sheet (Fig. 3D). 202 The residues D71 and E76 of the ODB make salt bridges with the R805 of the \u03b2 FTH. The 203 R59 at the C-terminal of the ODB \u03b11 forms a salt bridge with the E817 in TFL. The R62 204 and T63 of the strand \u03b24 connecting the helices \u03b11 and \u03b12 contact the R816 in TFL and the 205 K795 in TPL, respectively. The S106 in the loop connecting the strands \u03b25 and \u03b26 forms a 206 hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen atom of the K749 in the loop following the first 207 strand of the \u03b2 flap. The BTA domain forms interactions with the C-terminal of the \u03b2 FTH 208 via the N-terminal of the helix \u03b13, of which the R173 side chain is parallel to TFL. The 209 positively charged R67 and R69 region of \u03b2\u2032 zinc-binding domain (ZBD) complements the 210 negatively charged E76 and E77 of the HTH loop of the ODB domain (Fig. 3E). 211\n212 To confirm the importance of the residues contacting RNAP subunits in transcription 213 activation, they were replaced by alanine through site-directed mutagenesis. The mutants 214 were purified and assayed in MangoIII-based in vitro transcription assays as the wild-type 215 protein (Fig. 3F). Mutating residues R59, D71, E76 and R173 diminished the capability of 216 SAS to active transcription, whereas no obvious difference was observed between the T63A, 217 E77A, E246A, L247A and V249A mutants and the wild-type protein (Fig. S7). Mutating 218 residues E176, L211 and L243 resulted in insoluble proteins when they were expressed 219 under the same conditions as the wild-type protein. Some residues involved in RNAP 220 interactions are highly conserved in SARP homologues across various Streptomyces strains 221 (Fig. 3G), including T63 and D71 for interaction with the \u03b2 subunit, L243, E246, L247, and 222 V249 for interaction with \u03c3 R4. 223\n224 Interactions between SAS and \u03b1CTD 225 \u03b1CTD has versatility and important regulatory roles in modulating RNAP performance. In 226 E. coli RNAP, it recognizes specific sequences called UP elements in some promoters (33). 227 Many regulators have been reported to activate transcription by interacting with \u03b1CTD.

The \u03b1CTD is positioned on top of the helix bundle 230 of the downstream BTA domain. The helix \u03b12 of \u03b1CTD interacts with the helix bundles of 231 both upstream and downstream BTA domains and is almost perpendicular to them. The 232 loops preceding and following helix \u03b12, and the loop connecting helices \u03b14 and \u03b15 of \u03b1CTD 233 make contacts with the helix bundle of the downstream and upstream BTA domain, 234 respectively. The \u03b1CTD interface is predominantly positively charged (R259, R266, R287, 235 K292), complementing the negatively charged interface of BTA domains (D245, E246 and 236 D250 of the upstream BTA domain) (Fig. 4B). The residues R240 and L263 of the 237 downstream BTA domain interact with \u03b1CTD by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions 238 respectively. As shown in Fig. 4C, the \u03b1CTD is required for SAS-dependent activation. Site-239 directed mutational studies further confirmed the importance of interfacial residues for 240 SAS-dependent transcriptional activation. Moreover, most residues mentioned above for 241 contacting the \u03b1CTD are highly conserved in SARP homologues, including R240, D245, 242 E246, and L263. 243\n244\n245 3. Discussion 246 Streptomycete promoters exhibit a wide diversity in sequences and transcription patterns to 247 finetune the secondary metabolism to synthesize numerous natural products in response to 248 environmental change. Genome-wide mapping of transcriptional start sites and ChIP-seq 249 experiments of S. coelicolor, the model antibiotic-producing streptomycete, reveal that most 250 promoters have a conserved \u221210 element, but a highly variable \u221235 element(17, 18). The 251 promoter \u221235 elements of M. tuberculosis, another GC-rich actinomycete, are also lowly 252 conserved(34). Guanosines at the position \u221213 and \u221214 and a transcriptional cofactor RbpA 253 are shown to be important for promoters lacking a consensus \u221235 element(35). RbpA 254 improves the interaction between the \u221210 element and \u03c3 R2 by binding to RNAP subunits 255 and the promoter \u221213 and \u221214 positions(32). 256\n257 SARPs are well-known transcription activators of antibiotic biosynthesis. Here, we report a 258 strategy used by SAS to circumvent the recognition of a suboptimal \u221235 element and 259 activate transcription. Given the comparable protein architecture of SARPs and their 260 binding to similar motifs, SARPs are likely to function in a similar mode (Fig. 4D). The 261 position of afs box (centered at \u221229.5) is different from the binding boxes of typical class II 262\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Consequently, the downstream SAS protomer 263 is closer to RNAP and makes extensive contacts with \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2019 subunits (Fig. 3A). Within 264 the scope of our investigation, SARP demonstrates the most comprehensive interaction with 265 RNAP among the studied transcription activators, encompassing all subunits of RNAP 266 except for \u03c9, namely \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b2', and \u03c3 subunits. Particularly, SAS functions as an adaptor that 267 physically bonds the \u221235 region and \u03c3 R4 together to compensate for the suboptimal \u221235 268 element. In reported class II activator-TIC structures (22), the \u03c3 R4 binds in the major 269 groove of the \u221235 element and interacts with class II activators such as CAP (21), SoxS (36) 270 and Rob (37) (Fig. S8). The transcriptional activation mode of SAS mostly resembles that 271 of the mycobacterial transcriptional activator PafBC termed \u201csigma adaptation\u201d(30) (Fig. 272 S8F). PafBC inserts between PafBC-specific -26 element and \u03c3 R4 to facilitate the 273 recognition of promoters with suboptimal \u221235 elements. Our study showed that the \u201csigma 274 adaption\u201d principle was widely adopted in actinobacteria, as indicated by the ubiquitous 275 presence of SARP regulators. In addition, both SAS protomers make contacts with the 276 \u03b1CTD, enhancing the ability to activate transcription by recruiting RNAP. Notably, 277 although many activators in reported TIC structures are dimer, they only use one protomer 278 to contact \u03b1CTD. In class I CAP-TAC structures, the downstream protomer contacts the 279 \u03b1CTD (21). In contrast, the upstream protomer contacts the \u03b1CTD in class II TAP-TAC 280 structures (22). Given the extensive interaction of SAS with RNAP, we raise a hypothesis 281 that SAS may also activate transcription by a \u201cpre-recruitment\u201d mechanism, as exemplified 282 by SoxS (36). But in vitro binding assay of SAS and RNAP demonstrates that SAS is unable 283 to form a stable complex with RNAP in the absence of DNA (Fig. S9). 284\n285 The majority of filamentous Actinobacteria genera are known to possess SARP-type 286 regulatory genes, with examples including 98% of Streptomyces and 100% of Salinispora, 287 while the occurrence in Mycobacterium is relatively lower, at only 42% (38). \"Small\" SARP 288 regulators exhibit higher prevalence than \"large\" ones (8). These \"small\" SARPs hold 289 significant potential as tools for activating biosynthetic gene clusters, as evidenced by the 290 overexpression of SARPs to enhance the yield of natural products and the heterologous 291 expression of SARPs to effectively activate the expression of silent gene clusters (8, 39-41). 292\n293 ScAfsR contains extra ATPase and TPR domains at the C-terminal that are postulated to be 294 responsible for regulating the functions of the N-terminal SARP domain (Fig. 1A)(9). 295 ScAfsR belongs to the signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) 296\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

STAND proteins are presumed to keep in a monomeric inactive state by arm-297 based NOD\u2013sensor autoinhibitory interactions or inhibitor binding in the absence of cognate 298 inducer molecules, resembling a folded hand (43-46). Activation involves a multistep 299 process of inducer binding, autoinhibition release, nucleotide exchange and conformational 300 changes that allow oligomerization and switch the protein to an active state (47). This 301 suggests that the C-terminal domains of ScAfsR may potentially serve a similar role in 302 sensing and transmitting signals. However, the precise mechanism remains unclear and 303 requires further investigation. 304\n305 In summary, transcription activators of the SARP family have been exclusively found in 306 actinomycetes and play important roles in regulating secondary metabolism. Our detailed 307 structural analysis of SAS-TIC provides a molecular basis for understanding SARP-308 mediated antibiotic regulation in streptomycetes and offers potential optimizations for 309 antibiotic production. 310\n311 312 4. Materials and Methods 313 Plasmids 314 The genes encoding SAS (residues from 1 to 270 of ScAfsR), RbpA and CarD were cloned 315 from the genomic DNA of S. coelicolor M145, and inserted into the pET28a via NdeI and 316 EcoRI restriction sites to obtain pET28a-SAS, pET28a-rbpA and pET28a-carD respectively. 317 Plasmids carrying SAS mutants were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. Primers 318 used are listed in Table S1. 319\n320 Protein Expression and Purification 321 The vector pET28a-SAS, pET28a-rbpA and pET28a-carD were transformed into 322 BL21(DE3) respectively. Induction of expression was achieved by adding 0.3 mM 323 isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated for 12 h at 16\u00b0C and 220 rpm. 324 The cells were then harvested and resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mM 325 NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 5 mM imidazole). After purification by 326 nickel-NTA, the eluate was further loaded onto a size exclusion chromatography column 327 (SEC) (Superdex 200, Cytiva) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM 328 NaCl, 5% glycerol) and the purified proteins were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Purification of S. 329 coelicolor RNAP and \u03c3HrdB was carried out as described previously (27). 330\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

DNA fragments containing the afsS promoter (\u221250 to + 15) and 334 the MangoIII sequence were used as transcription templates. Primers used are listed in 335 Supplementary Table S1. A gradient concentration range of SAS (ranging from 62.5 nM to 336 1000 nM) was combined with 10 nM of promoter DNA at 30\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed 337 by supplementation of 100 nM of RNAP-\u03c3HrdB and 1 mM of NTPs in transcription buffer 338 (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 4 U RNaseIn, 1 \u03bcM 339 TO1\u2013PEG\u2013biotin and 5% Glycerol). The reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 \u00b0C and 340 stopped by 0.5 ng/\u03bcL (final concentration) heparin. In the investigation of the impact of 341 RbpA and CarD on the functionality of SAS and the transcription of afsS promoter, as well 342 as subsequent experiments involving SAS mutants, RbpA and CarD were co-incubated 343 within the transcriptional system as global transcription factors (48-50). 500 nM (final 344 concentration) of SAS or its variants, RbpA and CarD were used. The reaction without NTP 345 was used as blank. A multi-detection microplate reader (Tecan Spark\u00ae) was used to 346 measure fluorescence intensities. The emission wavelength was 535 nm and the excitation 347 wavelength was 510 nm. 348\n349 Fluorescence Polarization (FP) 350 A 32-bp afs box (\u221245 to \u221214) consisting of a 5\u2032-conjugated FAM was synthesized, annealled 351 and used as the DNA probe. The reaction mixture contained 10 nM of labelled dsDNA and 352 0-5 \u03bc\u043c purified SAS in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM 353 MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 5% glycerol and 0.1 \u03bcg/mL of poly(dI-dC)). After incubation at 30 \u00b0C 354 for 20 min, the fluorescence polarization of the reaction mixture was detected by a multi-355 detection microplate reader (Tecan Spark\u00ae) with excitation wavelength of 485 nm and 356 emission wavelength of 535 nm. Data from technical triplicates were fitted to a binding 357 equation Y=Bmax*X/(kD-ave+X) to obtain the kD-ave, where Y is the \u0394mP measured at a given 358 protein concentration (X) and Bmax is the maximum \u0394mP of completely bound DNA. 359\n360 Assembly of SAS-TIC complex 361 To construct SAS-TIC, we used a DNA scaffold engineered from the afsS promoter carrying 362 a 6-bp pre-melted transcription bubble. The DNA was prepared by annealing nt-strand (100 363 \u03bcM final) and t-strand (110 \u03bcM).

We then loaded the complexes onto a 368 Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare), eluted with assembling buffer, and used 369 them directly for cryo-EM grid preparation. 370\n371 Cryo-EM data acquisition and processing 372 SAS-TIC samples were added to freshly glow-discharged Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 Au 300 mesh 373 grids. In a Vitrobot (FEI, Inc.), grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane after being blotted 374 for 2 s at 16\u00b0C with 100% chamber humidity. The grids were imaged using SerialEM on 375 Titan Krios 300 kV microscopes with a K2 detector. The defocus ranged from \u22121.0 to \u22122.0 376\n\u03bcm, and the magnification was \u00d7130,000 in counting mode. 32 frames per movie were 377 collected with a total dose of 40 e\u2013/\u00c52. For SAS-TIC, 3741 movies were collected. 378\n379 The SAS-TIC data was processed using CryoSPARC suite v3.3.1. After motion correction, 380 patch CTF estimation, manual exposure curation, and template picker using selected 2D 381 classes from blob picker, two rounds of 2D classification were conducted (51). For SAS-382 TIC, 603659 particles were picked and used for ab-initio reconstruction (four classes). The 383 selected particles (193644 particles) were used for the second round of ab-initio 384 reconstruction (three classes) and heterogeneous refinement. The second 3D class (95223 385 particles, 49.2%) was selected and refined. Then, local resolution estimation and local 386 filtering were conducted to give final maps. By the process of particle subtraction and 387 masked local refinements to reserve only the signal around the SAS region, a local map with 388 improved quality was obtained (Fig. S3). 389\n390 Cryo-EM model building and refinement 391 The initial models of S. coelicolor RNAP\u03c3HrdB, RbpA, and CarD were generated from 392 PDB:7X75 (27), 5TW1 (32) and 4XLR (31), respectively. The initial atomic model of SAS 393 was generated by AlphaFold (52). The model of the promoter DNA was built in Coot (53). 394 The models of RNAP, SAS and DNA were fitted into the cryo-EM density maps using 395 ChimeraX (54).

The N-terminal ODB (OmpR-type DNA-binding) domain together with the following BTA (bacterial transcriptional activation) domain is referred to a SARP domain. TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; NOD, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain. (B) Hypothetical scheme for the regulation by AfsR in Streptomyces coelicolor. (C) Transcription assays with increasing concentrations (62.5 nM, 125 nM, 250 nM, 500 nM, 750 nM, 1000 nM) of SAS. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM from three independent assays. (D) Fluorescence polarization assay of SAS with afs box. The concentration of afs box was 10 nM. Error bars represent mean \u00b1 SEM of n=3 experiments. (E) Assembly of SAS-transcription initiation complex (TIC). The protein compositions in the dotted line boxed fractions are shown in the SDS-PAGE. (F) The afsS promoter fragment used for cryoEM structure determination. The -35 element, -10 element, the transcription start site (TSS) and the 6-bp noncomplementary bubble are denoted. The afs box is colored orange and contains DRup (the upstream direct repeat) and DRdown (the downstream direct repeat). The top (non-template) strand and bottom (template) strand are colored light green and dark green, respectively. (G) Two views of cryo-EM map. The map was generated by merging the consensus map of the full SAS-TIC and the focused map of the \u03b1CTD-SAS-DNA in Chimera X. NT, non-template; T, template. (H) Cartoon representation structure of SAS-TIC. The RNAP subunits, DNA, and regulators are colored as in the color scheme.\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
