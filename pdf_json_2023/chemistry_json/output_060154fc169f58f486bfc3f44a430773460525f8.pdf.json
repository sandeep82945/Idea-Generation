            "text": "Challenging synthetic organic transformations have driven the development of new protocols to diversify and broaden existing methods. New technologies and activation modes have dramatically changed how chemical space is being explored. Among the various challenges in the eld, the selective activation of a single C\u2013F bond in polyuorinated substrates has become a desirable transformation.1\u20133 The inherent interest in accessing C\u2013F bond-containing molecules is attributed to the fact that these bonds are prevalent in biologically active compounds. Fluorinated molecules have proved to be key in drug discovery programs because they can dramatically change the properties of drug candidates by improving stability, permeability, and, consequently, the efficacy of molecules discovered therein.4,5 It is not a coincidence that uorinated molecules are highly represented in many currently marketed drugs. Consequently, continuous efforts have been made to prepare and derivatize such molecules. A central challenge in this synthetic eld remains the high bond dissociation energy\nepartment of Chemistry, University of delphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6323, USA.\ny, University of Maryland, 8051 Regents\nrsity, 580 Ross St., College Station, Texas\ntion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nof C\u2013F bonds, which imposes limitations on selective bond cleavage and further functionalization in polyuorinated substrates.\nConsidering modern approaches to this challenge, electrochemical and photochemical methods have emerged as extremely useful technologies, allowing selective C\u2013F bond activation in various different classes of compounds,3,6 including uoroarenes,7\u201313 triuoromethylated arenes14\u201317 and -alkenes,18\u201323 gem-diuoroalkenes,24\u201329 and others, such as triuoromethylated esters, -amides,30\u201333 and -ketones34 under mild reaction conditions.\nIn this arena, photoinduced metal-free protocols represent a highly attractive approach to C\u2013F activation, providing valuable structures without trace metals; a feature that is especially relevant in the industrial sector. Small organic conjugated molecules have been shown to exhibit interesting properties as photocatalytic species, successfully allowing C\u2013F bond activation. Some examples include the use of pyrenes35 and phenoxazines15 in catalytic hydrodeuorination of polyuoroarenes and triuoromethylarenes, respectively; the exploration of phosphinophenolates32 in deuoroalkylation and hydrodeuorination of triuoromethylated substrates [e.g., esters, acetamides, and (hetereo)arenes]; in addition to the well-known applications of dicyanobenzenes as potent organophotocatalysts.16,33,36\nIn 2021, our group disclosed a metal-free and mechanistically novel approach to install gem-diuoromethylene groups from triuoroacetates and -acetamides onto (un)activated alkenes.30 The method was designed to be promoted by a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step via combination of diaryl\nChem.

Continuing with our interest in the synthesis of uorinated compounds via photoredox catalysis,19,21,22,37\u201339 we focused on developing a metal-free preparation of diuorinated oxindole derivatives via a cascade reaction between gem-diuoromethylene radicals and N-arylmethacrylamides, exploring the photoreactive nature of thiols as photocatalysts.\nAryl acrylamides are useful precursors to build more complex structures containing the oxindole moiety, known to exhibit extraordinary activities as drugs as well as being present in many active natural products.40\u201342 They have been explored in cascade-type transformations where the sequence of addition to the alkene moiety followed by cyclization and rearomatization leads to interesting and valuable compounds from a medicinal point of view. Our approach would represent a complementary and alternative route to access these privileged motifs under milder conditions, extending the chemical space covered by previous advances in the eld, which have demonstrated the use of triuoromethylated arenes17 and -ketones34 as gemdiuoromethylene radical sources. In these examples, activation of the C\u2013F bond was achieved by employing a combination of Ir-catalysts and Lewis acids to facilitate the uoride elimination (Fig. 1a).\nPrevious approaches to installing gem-diuoroacetates for the preparation of valuable diuorinated oxindoles make use of harsh conditions in the presence of metal-based catalysts, oxidants, and/or high temperatures, and are restricted regarding the structural diversication of the uorinated moiety (Fig. 1b).43\u201346 Recently, a seminal Giese addition protocol using triuoromethylated compounds was also reported by the Shang group, supporting the application of thiolate species as reductants and HAT catalysts. An efficient hydrodeuorination of triuoroacetates, -arenes, and -amides and the coupling with a range of alkenes was reported (Fig. 1c).31 In another vein, Chiba and co-workers explored the powerful ability of photoexcited thiol anions to promote the single-electron reduction of aryl halides with reduction potentials as low as \u22122.4 V vs. SCE,47,48 while Hamashima explored thiobenzoic acid as a single-electron reducing agent and HAT agent to promote regioselectivie Ca\u2013H arylation reactions.49 All of these precedents demonstrate the rich applicability of sulfur anions as potential photocatalysts.50\nSeeking alternative methods that would provide easy access to gem-diuoromethyl radicals under metal-free and milder conditions, we recognized that benzenethiols play a key role as photocatalysts under blue and purple light irradiation and, in the presence of sodium formate,30\u201332,36,51,52 directly lead to selective mono C\u2013F bond cleavage in triuoroacetates. Herein, we report a transition metal-free, mild, and operationally simple method to overcome the limitations associated with the preparation of uorinated oxindole molecules by single C\u2013F bond activation (Fig. 1d)."

Sci., 2023, 14, 2379\u20132385\nthe deuorinative alkylation protocol between the N-arylmethacrylamide 1 and the triuoroacetate 2 demonstrated that the use of 20 mol% of the organophotocatalyst, in combination with sodium formate and KHCO3, provides access to the corresponding diuorinated oxindole 3 in 95% yield under 390 nm wavelength LED irradiation (Table 1, entry 1). Lowering the catalyst loading led to erosion of the yield (Table 1, entry 2). The use of excess triuoroacetate provided high yields, however the utilization of fewer equivalents also gave the product in moderate yields (Table 1, entry 3) (see Table S1 for the complete optimization, ESI\u2020). Because this source of gem-diuoromethylene radical is a commercially available, bench-stable, and cost-accessible material in comparison to bromo/iododiuoroacetates, we decided to proceed with the use of 10 equivalents for the study of this transformation.\nNotably, the reaction successfully takes place under an oxygen atmosphere, and no degassing of the reaction is required. These results indicate the operational simplicity of the developed protocol, and the open-to-air conditions still lead to excellent results even though oxygen is known to oxidize\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Other alternative sulfoxide and sulfone-based solvents, such as tetramethylene sulfoxide and sulfolane, did not lead to formation of the desired product (see ESI\u2020). The use of base was also important to achieve high yields (Table 1, entry 4), and sodium formate was demonstrated to be a crucial component for the reaction to take place (Table 1, entry 5). Regarding the irradiation source, the photocatalyst showed poor activity under 427 nm wavelength Kessil irradiation (Table 1, entry 6). As control experiments, no transformation occurred in the absence of irradiation (Table 1, entry 7) or using TEMPO as a radical scavenger, indicating the radical nature of the transformation.\nTo demonstrate the applicability of the developed metal-free protocol, we prepared a library of oxindole derivatives containing diverse functional groups attached to the aromatic ring of the N-arylmethacrylamide component, as well as other diverse substructural motifs (Fig. 2). As expected, electron-donating groups were amenable to this photochemical diuoroalkylation protocol, providing compounds 4\u20136 with good yields. Halogen atoms were also successfully tolerated, with excellent compatibility with a para-uoro substituent in 7. Other halogen moieties such as chloride and bromide substituents in the para-, meta-, and ortho positions on the aromatic ring (8\u201311) also showed good reactivity. A naphthyl aromatic ring was also included, providing the corresponding diuorinated oxindole 12 with lower yield, which can be attributed to a competitive hydroarylation reaction leading to the formation of the benzodihydroquinolinone product.54 The gem-diuoromethyl radical was also smoothly added to a 1,1-disubstituted olen to provide compound 13 with\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\n80% yield and 1 : 1 dr. Given the potential of the method, we further applied it to the preparation of more complex fused tricyclic compounds. The oxindole derivative derived from tetrahydroisoquinoline (14) was successfully obtained with moderate yield. Further examples to explore the scope included modication of the alkenemoiety of theN-arylmethacrylamide. Spirocyclic compounds possess recognized relevance in biological chemistry and are considered challenging targets in organic synthesis.41,55 By using internal alkenes in ve- and six-membered rings, spirocyclic compounds 15 and 16 were readily prepared in excellent yields. Finally, the benzyl- and phenyl protecting groups (17 and 18, respectively) were also tolerated under the developed protocol, while the unprotected or Boc-protected acrylamides or phenyl methacrylate precursors did not lead to the desired products.\nAttention was next turned to verifying the uoroalkylation of other triuoromethylated compounds via the developed metalfree strategy. Extending the scope using triuoroacetates, selective C\u2013F bond cleavage was found to occur smoothly when other derivatives were employed (Fig. 3). For example, aliphatic ester-containing alkyl- and aromatic groups (as in phenethyl(19) and 2-cyclohexylethyl- (20) triuoroacetates) underwent the\nChem.

Other a,adiuorinated aliphatic carboxylate esters containing secondary aliphatic groups were accessed, such as those in the isopropyl(21), and cyclohexyl (22) derivatives, and the tertiary example containing the sterically demanding adamantyl group (23). Other challenging CF3-containing substrates were engaged in the cascade transformation. Ethyl pentauoropropionate (Ered = \u22122.6 V vs. SCE)30 smoothly underwent regioselective single C\u2013F bond activation to provide the corresponding diuorooxindole derivative 24 containing an intact CF3 group in 78% yield. Additionally, 25, derived from ethyl diuoroacetate, which presents an even more challenging reduction potential than other substrates (Ered = \u22122.9 V vs. SCE),30 was also successfully accessed, although in lower yield.\nThe protocol was further extended to triuoromethylated amide precursors. Amide-containing compounds are valued structures from a medicinal and synthetic point of view, given the intrinsic properties associated with this functional group,\n2382 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 2379\u20132385\nsuch as their polarity, stability, and H-bonding capability.56 Diuorinated oxindole derivatives containing pendant amidegroups (26\u201329) were thus generated in modest to good yields. The triuoroacetamide (Ered=\u22122.2 V vs. SCE) gave direct access to the desired compound 26 from the deuorinative-cascade process in 60% yield, and the diphenyl derivative 27 was also accessed in modest yield. Interestingly from a synthetic point of view, the acetamides containing halogen atoms at the para position on the aromatic ring underwent the transformation in moderate to good yield (28 and 29). The thiolate excited-state presents a highly reducing power (Ered = \u22123.3 V vs. SCE)31 capable of promoting a competitive homolytic C\u2013X bond cleavage, which may be associated with the yields observed for halogenated compounds. Electron-rich acetamides provided poor results, as in 30 and 31. Limitations were found regarding the use of acetamides containing electron-withdrawing groups, and the derivatives substituted with cyano- and di-CF3 groups did not react under the developed conditions (see ESI for more information\u2020). Although the method still presents opportunities to be explored to extend the scope regarding the use of structurally diverse amides, the method avoids the use of Lewis acids as additives, which are usually employed to lower the reduction potential of these species.30 Finally, exploring the further potential of the developed method, the use of triuoromethyltoluene provides access to the arylated diuoroindole derivative 32 in 53% yield, and a similar yield was found when 1,3-(bis)triuoromethyltoluene was evaluated (33). The scope also included the p-uorotoluene derivative, which gave rise to 34 in 44% yield. For other halogenated arenes (X = Br, I), the homolytic C\u2013X bond cleavage was observed instead, indicating the powerful reducing properties of the organophotocatalyst employed in the study. These results demonstrate the applicability of the method via another mechanistic approach, complementing the protocols disclosed recently introducing diuoromethyl ketones and -arenes under photocatalytic conditions.17,34\nGiven the importance of the scalability of new synthetic methods aiming at industrial applications, we successfully achieved the preparation of 1.9 grams (10 mmol scale) of compound 3 in 64% yield under the standard reaction conditions. For this demonstration, we employed 4 equivalents of triuoroacetate 2, and the yield was comparable to the small-\nmethoxybenzenethiol.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

As noted in Fig. 4, the large-scale experiment was easily performed simply by using a large round-bottom ask irradiated with the 390 nm light source. The scope regarding the triuoroacetates nicely complements and extends other reported protocols, allowing for the rst time the installation of these motifs onto N-arylmethacrylamides via C\u2013F bond activation.\nFinally, to gain insights into the mechanism of this transformation, we employed dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) computations (Fig. 5 and ESI\u2020). As shown in Fig. 5, the proposed mechanism initiates with the formation of the thiolate species II from deprotonation of the thiol I in the presence of base. The thiolate II is then promoted to the excited anion (III) under purple light irradiation. Given the strong ability of the latter to act as a reductant (Ered =\u22123.3 V vs. SCE),31 the initial deuorinative step to form the radical anion species Ac\u2212 should take place via single electron reduction of the ethyl triuoroacetate 2 (Ered = \u22122.0 V vs. SCE), as supported by quenching experiments.30 In the thiolate catalytic cycle, the thiyl radical IV formed is prone to undergo dimerization, and it is in equilibrium with the disulde V.\nThis species also demonstrated the ability to play a role as the pre-catalyst, providing product 3 with a 95% yield when used instead of I (Table S2, ESI\u2020). Regeneration of the precatalyst I can then take place via HAT between IV and sodium formate. In this step, the reductant CO2c\n\u2212 is formed, which can also contribute to the generation of the active thiolate species II by promoting the reductive cleavage of the S\u2013S bond in V. Each of these processes is energetically feasible (see ESI for full computational details\u2020). Additionally, the quantum yield (F) value for the transformation was found to be 0.35, which suggests that a chain process is possibly not operating. Thus, the formate radical anion is unlikely to be contributing to the reduction of 2.30,33,36,57\nFrom this point, the formed C-centered radical anion species Ac\u2212 undergoes a spin-center shi (SCS)58 to form the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nelectrophilic gem-diuoromethyl radical intermediate Cc, which was also observed as a TEMPO adduct in the control experiments. DFT computations suggest that the SCS proceeds through a stepwise 1,2-F migration pathway (TS-A-B), wherein the uorine on the terminal carbon shis to the carbonyl carbon. This process is energetically feasible (DG\u2021 = 13.3 kcal mol\u22121). Following the 1,2-F migration, the uoride is released as an anion (via coordination with sodium from sodium formate) which forms the carbon-centered radical Cc.59 In turn, alkyl radical Cc then undergoes regioselective and irreversible Giese addition to the olen moiety of the N-arylmethacrylamide (1) to form the radical intermediate Dc. Finally, a facile radical cyclization followed by rearomatization would take place to furnish the diuorinated oxindole 3. The DFT calculation indicated that this latter is likely to be proceeding via a HAT mechanism, where the hydrogen can be abstracted by the radical intermediate carbon centered radical Cc, which is being formed in excess in the reaction medium. Other radical intermediates, such as Ac\u2212 and CO2c\n\u2212, could be operative in this mechanism as well, however, the pathway via Cc hydrogen abstraction is more energetically feasible. A second reaction mechanism for the rearomatization step would involve a single electron oxidation of Ec by the thiyl radical IV to provide the corresponding carbocation intermediate, which aer proton loss would furnish the nal diuorinated compound 3. Although this pathway (Fig. S11, ESI\u2020) is slightly less energetically favorable than the radical HAT pathways described, the reaction is still energetically feasible and the rearomatization process is irreversible."

The preparation of a library of valuable oxindole derivatives was accomplished under mild reaction conditions using the thiolate excited state as an organophotocatalyst. DFT computational results supporting the proposed reaction pathway complement the experimental studies and shed light on the reactivity of these readily available and powerful catalytic species. Taking advantage of the operational simplicity of the method, the reaction was performed under open-to-air conditions, allowing an easy scale-up for the multigram preparation of a target molecule. This protocol complements the synthetic tools available to install gem-diuoromethyl radicals via C\u2013F activation, avoiding the use of rare metal-based catalysts and the use of expensive halogen-diuoroacetates as radical sources. Given the relevance and challenges found in this synthetic approach, the practical and accessible procedure described herein contributes to the advancement of the eld of selective C\u2013F bond activation and extends chemical space of important uorinated motifs, unlocking new opportunities to explore the powerful reduction potential of excited thiolates in further transformations under photocatalytic conditions."
