Motivation exists in most human behaviors and in learning. Keller, an American psychology professor, believes that non-intelligence factors determine the learning effect, and learning motivation is the core non-intelligence factor (Keller, 1987). Therefore, learning motivation has a substantial impact on learning results. The unitary music teaching mode is one of the reasons for the continuous decline in music students\u2019 learning motivation. Applying the attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) motivation design model in music teaching provides teachers with diversified teaching forms. When music teachers are planning classes, to optimize the quality of their teaching, they should fully understand their teaching materials and their students\u2019 emotional and behavioral motivation (Zhou and Tang, 2020).\nIn 1984, Keller first introduced the origin, significance, and theoretical basis of the ARCS motivation model and introduced the application of the ARCS motivation model to teaching design (Liao et al., 2020). In 1988, Keller and Suzuki started research on the practical application of the ARCS motivation model (Christine et al., 2015). In 1996, Keller reported relevant strategies of motivation design based on multimedia features. Since then, the ARCS motivation model has\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 917476\nbeen applied in many countries and fields worldwide (D\u00f6rnyei and Al-Hoorie, 2017). Since 2013, research on the ARCS motivation model in China has gradually gained attention, and the practice of various teaching forms has been widely used (He, 2021). In the last 10 years, research on the ARCS motivation model has mainly focused on optimizing the model itself and the universality of its application. Compared with other theories, this model is more practical and suitable for education (Li, 2018; Li et al., 2018).\nIn this study, the traditional teaching contents of the ARCS motivation model and analyzes the problems of the students\u2019 learning motivation for the music teaching of middle school students emotion and behavior, to the traditional ARCS motivation model coding, system optimization, set up the corresponding teaching strategies, and apply it to the practice of music teaching, arouse the students\u2019 interest in learning music and motivation. It provides theoretical support for music teaching practice."

            "text": "The ARCS coding system is composed of the first letters of four English words: Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction (Angelo, 2017). The ARCS motivation model includes four first-level strategies: A: attention strategy, R: immediate strategy, C: self-confidence strategy, and S: satisfaction strategy. Through the theoretical research and development status analysis of the ARCS motivation model, the ARCS motivation model is built based on comprehensive learning motivation theory, endowed with macro and broad applicability. The ARCS motivation model can be applied to more fields, but it does not apply to fixed subjects. It is necessary to systematically optimize the coding of traditional ARCS according to the characteristics of music teaching and the emotion and behavior of students in music learning."

Although cultivating and preserving the learners\u2019 learning motivation is a form of systematic engineering that involves a wide range and runs through the learning process, attracting and supporting learners\u2019 attention is the first and most critical step in stimulating and maintaining learners\u2019 learning motivation.\nAttention in music teaching has the characteristics of directivity and concentration, including intentional attention and unintentional attention. Changing how media are presented generally only attracts involuntary attention, while exposing learners to interesting problems will attract deliberate attention. Teaching staff should use students\u2019 conscious awareness to stimulate and maintain learning motivation in the teaching process. The primary purpose of instructional designers is to arouse learners\u2019 curiosity and make them choose to direct their attention to learning activities consciously or\nunconsciously. Table 1 shows the optimized coding system for the attention strategy."

            "text": "Immediacy refers to the relationship between learning content and learning objectives. When the students\u2019 attention is caught, they may ask, \u201cHow does this relate to our goals?\u201d According to the expectation and value theory, the degree of correlation between learning objectives and learning content can determine the depth of learning content (Chen, 2019). Therefore, when learners think that the learning content is closely related to the learning goal, they will usually show more interest, thereby encouraging the positive development of learning motivation.\nThere are two kinds of immediacy in music teaching: objective-oriented proximity and process-oriented closeness. Purpose-oriented realism is instrumental and practical. Students\u2019 learning motivation is stimulated if the learning content helps the learners achieve an important goal. Process orientation considers the learners\u2019 feelings in the learning process and emphasizes that learners should feel that the learning itself is consistent with their personal characteristics. An excellent emotional experience will stimulate learning motivation when learners think they have a role in the learning process (Yi and Wu, 2020). Table 2 shows an optimized coding system for relevance.\nThe essential difference between the two kinds of immediacy is that purposeful immediacy locates the motivation source on the setting of external utilitarian goals. Although appropriate goal setting is conducive to the internalization of learning motivation, the goal is still a part of external incentives, and its motivational effect will not last long. However, process immediacy emphasizes the pleasure of the learning process and makes the initially complex learning become fun rather than a burden, thereby combining the two kinds of proximity to achieve the best effect."

            "text": "Confidence is the third element that inspires and sustains learning motivation. Confidence means that students believe they have a distinct possibility of success and can complete learning tasks and achieve learning goals. When learners become interested in learning and developing their skills, Keller thinks they need to be motivated to help them overcome difficulties and obstacles. They need to establish the confidence of \u201cbelieving that they can complete tasks.\u201d Otherwise, they may give up on the learning tasks. According to Room\u2019s expectation theory, people are always eager to meet particular needs and achieve specific goals. This goal has an impact on stimulating people\u2019s motivation. The size of the motivational power depends on the target value (Valence) and expectation rate (Expectancy). The formula is: MF = E \u2013 V. MF is the Motive Force or strength of motivation. E is Expectancy, meaning the probability that a specific action may lead to realizing the desired goal. V is Valence, referring to people\u2019s emphasis on a particular destination or achievement (Peng, 2020). Table 3 shows the optimized coding system for the confidence strategy. The expected rate is proportional to the intimate connection with self-confidence. If learners have no confidence, it is E = 0, so even if learning is itself titer enabled him to get enough interests, V-, continue to promote learning\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 917476\nmotivation MF is still zero. The vital role of confidence in learning motivation cannot be ignored."

            "heading": "Satisfaction Strategy",
            "text": "Satisfaction is the psychological experience that learners get when their learning results are consistent with their positive expectations. Satisfaction is the fourth element of the ARCS motivation design model and an essential condition for learners to generate continuous learning motivation (Zhao and Zhang, 2018). In learning, students should have learning results and should experience a sense of accomplishment after completing the task. The factors that affect satisfaction are reinforcement and feedback, internal reward, and cognitive evaluation. Cognitive evaluation refers to the internal process of evaluating the consequences of behavior according to one\u2019s expectations. If a person has a high expectation of success, they may not feel satisfied with the result after completing the task. Conversely, if the level of expectation is low, the student may experience satisfaction.\nThe ARCS motivation design model can be regarded as a process. The first element in stimulating a person\u2019s learning motivation is to attract attention and interest in learning, to make the learner understand that the accomplishment of the task depends on them. Then, the learner needs to feel confident in his ability to perform the task. Finally, the learner should experience a sense of achievement and satisfaction (Xu, 2020). Table 4 shows the optimized coding system for satisfaction. Therefore, attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction are a whole. There is no primary or secondary aspect, and the lack of any one element may cause learners to lose learning motivation.\nThe ARCS motivation model provides music teachers with the basic teaching design ideas. First, they need to attract students\u2019 attention. Second, teaching content should be closely linked to students\u2019 interests and needs. Next, students should be helped to build self-confidence and to be convinced that they can succeed. Finally, teachers should strengthen students\u2019 satisfaction, thereby maintaining their learning motivation at a high level.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 917476\nTABLE 4 | Satisfaction strategy coding system after optimization.\nFirst strategy Secondary strategy Motivational strategies\nS Satisfaction strategy S1 internal reinforcement S1-1: Use knowledge to solve practical problems in life\nS1-2: Praise the students verbally and agree with their opinions\nS1-3: Help students who have not completed a task\nS2 external reinforcement S2-1: Congratulate students for good behavior\nS2-2: Give personal attention to students"

Word processing software ensured clear and concise text presentation and smooth sentences, and the teachers modified unclear or idiomatic expressions to preserve the original expressions, behaviors, and emotions. The classroom videos were coded according to the motivational strategies of the optimized ARCS motivational model.\nIn classroom teaching, a student\u2019s learning behavior involves not just one motivational stimulation strategy but it is likely to involve multiple motivational stimulation strategies. Therefore, there are several different results in the coding according to the optimized ARCS motivation model within the same period. The teachers analyzed the classroom videos, identifying the motivational strategies and coding them according to the ARCS motivation model involved in the class.\nTake \u201cHappy Little Flute\u201d (Case 7) as an example. At the beginning of class, in a loud voice, the teacher asks the students, \u201cDo you want to live a happy life?\u201d Not the opening words of teachers, and chose the \u201cgood life\u201d everyone want to stimulate students\u2019 interest in learning, to the other coding for \u201croom A41 teacher use humor language\u201d this problem, students answer \u201cto\u201d actively.

A reliability and validity test analysis of the coding\nwas necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the final coding results (Thomas, 2017). The number of codes in this paper is too large to test all the coding results, so one teaching clip was randomly selected from each classroom teaching video, 14 learning clips in total. The datawould be too tedious if we were to code all the motivational strategies involved in each teaching segment. Therefore, we only observe one of the most important motivational strategies in each teaching segment. \u201cAn attention strategy\u201d was observed in teaching segments 1\u20134; \u201cR relevance strategy\u201d was observed in teaching segments 5\u2013 8: \u201cC confidence strategy\u201d was observed in teaching segments 9\u201311; and \u201cS satisfaction strategy\u201d was observed in teaching segments 11\u201314. If no first-level strategy was observed in the selected segment, the next time node was selected, and the sequential deduction was not chosen randomly again. The 14 extracted fragments were recoded and tested according to the optimized ARCS system and provisions, and the coding results were analyzed and compared. Table 6 shows the coding results for the 14 lessons. A is the author, and B and C are two graduate students of different grades and genders. Having three people coding together ensures that data will not result in incorrect conclusions arising from gender, age, and other subjective factors.\nThe coding results of the two graduate students were compared with those of the author. They qualified no controversial encoding results since the first-level policy encoding before. After the discussion and consensus of different coding results, two significant differences remained, making the consistency an acceptable 95.23%. The optimized ARCS motivation model can be used as the basis for the analysis of research on high-quality classes (Guo, 2019)."

Table 7 shows the specific results.\nTable 7 shows that \u201cA attention strategy\u201d is the most frequently used strategy by teachers in class, accounting for 59.08% of the total, indicating that in music classroom teaching, teachers use many strategies to attract and maintain students\u2019 attention. Focusing students\u2019 attention on the classroom is the most frequently used strategy to stimulate and sustain students\u2019 learning emotion and behavior motivation, followed by the \u201cR relevance strategy\u201d (about 18.03%) and the \u201cS satisfaction strategy\u201d (about 13.65%). \u201cR relevance strategy\u201d is related to students\u2019 previous knowledge and experience. Music is a subject that is very close to life, and teachers use many examples related to students\u2019 learning life in class to stimulate students\u2019 interest in learning. \u201cS satisfaction strategy\u201d mainly focuses on the interaction between students and their emotional and behavioral interactions, which teachers praise in a timely and appropriate manner.

The following is a detailed analysis of specific teaching fragments from high-quality classes. Note that the total number of strategies used is 1,723. Figure 1 shows the percentage of secondary systems.\nA1 involved the use of conflict policy 68 times. They accounted for 4% of attention policies. When students are presented with conflicts with their life experiences, providing two equally reasonable but only one correct example will attract students\u2019 attention and make them think more positively and judge right from wrong using what they have learned. During the recording of the 14 class videos, teachers of high-quality classes\nTABLE 7 | Statistics for attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) motivational strategies.\nFirst strategy Secondary strategy Number of uses Total Percentage\nA Attention A1 conflict 68 1,723 59.08%\nA2 concrete 571\nA3 change 402\nA4 humor 54\nA5 question 593\nA6 participation 35\nR Relevance strategy\nR1 experience 189 526 18.03%\nR2 learning value 139\nR3 requirements matching 173\nR4 model 25\nC Confidence strategy\nC1 learning requirements 164 272 9.33%\nC2 expectations 30\nC3 attribution 78\nS Satisfaction strategy\nS1 internal reinforcement 214 398 13.65%\nS2 external reinforcement 174\nused strategies such as inducing cognitive conflict to stimulate students\u2019 interest in learning.\nA2 involved the use of a materialization strategy 571 times, accounting for 33% of attention strategies. On the whole, motivation incentive strategies were used more often. Cognitive theory holds that, in classroom teaching, teachers should allow students to learn in a realistic environment. Simply teaching could easily cause students to find it difficult to integrate their learning emotions. Students are less motivated to learn. Visual aids and examples attract students\u2019 attention, concretize the concepts in lyrics, allow them to visualize notes, and connect the music world with students\u2019 lives.\nA3 change involved the frequent use of motivation incentive strategy. It can be easy for students to pay attention consciously in class, but they find it difficult to pay attention for long periods. According to the ARCS motivation model, to maintain students\u2019 attention, teachers need to constantly change their style of expression. They need to use body language and to change how they organize their teaching so that they can trigger students\u2019 concentration.\nA4 used the use of humor as a strategy 54 times, accounting for 3% of attention strategies. The overall frequency of use was moderate. Humorous people often have a wide range of knowledge and creative expressions. Amusing behavior and expressions allow students to easily accept knowledge and to be relaxed and receptive. Humorous teachers attract the attention of students, stimulate their interest in learning, and make it easy to acquire knowledge.\nA5 involved the frequent use of query strategy, 593 times, accounting for about 35% of the attention strategies. Quality classes usually begin by creating problem situations for students. Active thinking is the process through which people constantly discover and solve problems. The core of the questioning strategy is the new problem presented. It should be in conflict with the students\u2019 actual knowledge and experience, resulting in students\u2019 mental imbalance and thinking motivation.\nIn A6, student participation in classroom teaching activities accounted for 2% of attention strategies. The greater the degree of involvement, the more active the students, and the stronger the students\u2019 sense of a dominant status experience.

This item accounts for the lowest proportion and focuses on music curriculum optimization and improvement."

Figure 2 shows the proportion of secondary strategies.\nR1 experience accounted for 36% of the total use times. Constructivist theory holds that students do not enter the classroom knowing nothing. Students have already acquired rich knowledge and experience in daily life, very important for their learning of content. With a knowledge foundation, students can quickly enter the state of learning. Comparing the teaching process, the teaching content, and the actual life experience can attract students\u2019 attention and enable them to understand new concepts.\nR2 learning value accounted for 26% of the total use times. When students think that the knowledge does not apply in life,\nthey are not able to appreciate the importance of music. Music comes from life and is the crystallization of life. Instead of having students memorize lyrics and tones. The value of music is the motivation to stimulate students\u2019 interest in learning.\nR3 requirements match 33% of the time. Teachers can attend to the needs of students and try their best to meet those needs. When the needs of students are met, the students will inevitably have greater interest in the classroom, and it will be easier to stimulate their learning motivation. \u201cPlease answer,\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d \u201cPlease sit down,\u201d and other such phrases will invariably close the distance between teachers and students, meet the needs of the students, and establish mutual trust between teachers and students. When students feel that the instructor is easy to get to know, they will be more motivated to learn.\nR4 model accounted for 5% of the total use times. Students cannot appreciate the personal charm of artists without understanding their spirit and courage in pursuing their art. Teachers\u2019 timely introduction of events and people will arouse students\u2019 curiosity and interest in exploring the art world and learning more actively."

Figure 3 shows the percentage of secondary strategies.\nAccording to the ARCS motivation model, the following aspects can enhance students\u2019 self-confidence.\nC1 precise learning requirements account for 60% of the total use times. Classroom teaching objectives refer to the expected results of teaching activities: the concretization of educational purposes, teaching goals, curriculum objectives, and the requirements and standards for teachers to complete teaching tasks. It is not difficult for teachers to set classroom teaching objectives, but it is difficult for students to understand the requirements of teachers and to act on them.\nC2 expectation accounted for 11% of the total use times. Every student is afraid of failure and wants to do their best. While stimulating and maintaining students\u2019 learning motivation, teachers should think about how to develop students\u2019 self-confidence. Appropriate encouragement could help students overcome difficulties with confidence. Proper expectations mean\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 917476\nthat the teachers\u2019 goals are of a certain level and the students are capable of completing the tasks set. Teachers should encourage students appropriately and believe that the students can succeed.\nC3 attribution accounted for 29% of the total use times. Correct attribution helps clarify the causal relationship between teachers and students\u2019 behaviors, examine the differences between students\u2019 behaviors and their psychological and behavioral results, predict learning motivation, improve learning behavior, and improve learning effectiveness. Correct attribution is also helpful in enhancing students\u2019 self-awareness. Teachers should guide, attend to, and train students\u2019 proper attribution for negative reasons."

            "text": "S satisfaction strategy was used 398 times in total, accounting for about 13.65% of the total use times. Figure 4 shows the percentage of secondary strategies.\nWhen students make some effort to get results consistent with expectations, they will be satisfied. This satisfaction will further stimulate students to produce continuous, independent, in-depth learning motivation, resulting in new learning behavior.\nS1 reinforcement of internal motivation accounted for 55% of the total use times. Internal motivation refers to people\u2019s spontaneous cognition of engaging activities. There is no need to stimulate internal motivation. It is generated by the students themselves, and teachers need to think about maintaining and enhancing students\u2019 inner motivation. In class, students can use the knowledge learned in the class to solve problems in actual production and life without the help of others, and this will strengthen students\u2019 internal motivation. Their interest in learning will naturally become higher and higher.\nS2 enhanced external motivation accounted for 45% of the total use times. External motivation is the motivation induced by stimuli other than the individual\u2019s activities. In the classroom, external reinforcement is nothing more than the correct feedback behavior of teachers at the school. Correct feedback from teachers can make it clear to students whether their way of thinking and behaving are accurate. They can fully mobilize students\u2019 enthusiasm, improve their interest in learning, and enhance their learning motivation."

            "text": "By grasping the basic theory and the characteristics of the music discipline, Keller\u2019s ARCS motivation was coded and optimized to establish a motivation coding system suitable for music classes. The optimized ARCS motivation model was used to transcribe and encode 14 high-quality music class videos, and the optimized ARCS motivation model was analyzed and verified. The quantitative analysis, combined with the qualitative research, allowed the following conclusions to be drawn.\n(1) Many motivational strategies teachers use in the 14 highquality music lessons conform to the motivational approach in the ARCS motivational model. The statistics show that teachers mostly use an attention strategy in class, indicating that teachers use many strategies to attract and maintain students\u2019 attention and concentration in class is the effort to stimulate and sustain students\u2019 learning motivation.\n(2) R intimacy strategy (about 18.03%) and S satisfaction strategy (approximately 13.65%) were second only to A in frequency. \u201cR vital strategy\u201d is related to a student\u2019s previous knowledge and life experience. Music is a subject close to life, and teachers often use examples related to students\u2019 learning and life in class to stimulate students\u2019 interest in education. \u201cS satisfaction strategy\u201d mainly focuses on teachers\u2019 timely praise after students\u2019 interactions.\n(3) C confidence strategy accounted for a small proportion of the whole, about 9.33%, and was rarely used. It is the crucial index for further optimization of the model.\n(4) The optimized ARCS motivation model is suitable for music teaching. It can help teachers motivate students more effectively in classroom teaching. The studies and practice cases prove the teaching strategies of the model. It is a practical basis for stimulating students\u2019 emotions and behavior in modern music teaching classrooms."
