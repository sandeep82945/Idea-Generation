    "abstractText": "Fine-tuning (via methods such as instruction-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback) is a crucial step in training language models to robustly carry out tasks of interest. However, we lack a systematic understanding of the effects of fine-tuning, particularly on tasks outside the narrow fine-tuning distribution. In a simplified scenario, we demonstrate that improving performance on tasks within the fine-tuning data distribution comes at the expense of suppressing model capabilities on other tasks. This degradation is especially pronounced for tasks \u201cclosest\u201d to the fine-tuning distribution. We hypothesize that language models implicitly infer the task of the prompt corresponds, and the fine-tuning process predominantly skews this task inference towards tasks in the fine-tuning distribution. To test this hypothesis, we propose Conjugate Prompting to see if we can recover pretrained capabilities. Conjugate prompting artificially makes the task look farther from the fine-tuning distribution while requiring the same capability. We find that conjugate prompting systematically recovers some of the pretraining capabilities on our synthetic setup. We then apply conjugate prompting to real-world LLMs using the observation that fine-tuning distributions are typically heavily skewed towards English. We find that simply translating the prompts to different languages can cause the fine-tuned models to respond like their pretrained counterparts instead. This allows us to recover the in-context learning abilities lost via instruction tuning, and more concerningly, to recover harmful content generation suppressed by safety fine-tuning in chatbots like ChatGPT.",

            "text": "The development of large language models (LLMs) typically involves two stages\u2014pretraining (next token prediction) on vast text corpora and fine-tuning on carefully curated datasets to adapt the pretrained model to the application of interest. The fine-tuning stage is critical in enabling language models to output helpful text, and there has been significant interest in various fine-tuning methods such as instruction-tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Taori et al., 2023) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (Christiano et al., 2023; Stiennon et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Ziegler et al., 2020). One fundamental concern is that fine-tuning datasets are considerably smaller and less diverse than web-scale pretraining datasets (Raffel et al., 2020; Arivazhagan et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2021), and there is always a risk that the fine-tuned model \u201ccatastrophically forgets\u201d (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989) how to solve problems that the pretrained model could solve. Such a gap has been reported as an \u201calignment tax\u201d in works such as Ouyang et al. (2022) and Bai et al. (2022), but there is no clear understanding of what these trade-offs are and how to mitigate them. Given the importance of the fine-tuning process, it is imperative to build a systematic understanding of the effects. In this work, we introduce a synthetic setup to understand the effects of fine-tuning. Building on the prior work of in-context learning linear functions (Garg et al., 2023) by pretraining transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) on a large number of weight vectors, we show that the resulting transformers can be sub-optimal when evaluated on a few specific weight vectors of special interest. This mirrors real-world settings where the pretraining data is uncurated data from the web, while there are some \u201cnatural\u201d tasks of special interest, like question answering. We find that fine-tuning on the\nCode available at https://github.com/kothasuhas/understanding-forgetting\nar X\niv :2\n30 9.\n10 10\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n8 Se\np 20\n23\nweights (tasks) of interest enables transformers to achieve optimal performance on these tasks but comes at the cost of performing worse on other tasks (Figure 4). We further examine the performance degradation induced by fine-tuning and observe a striking structure in terms of which tasks are adversely affected. The most affected tasks are outside but still \u201cclose\u201d to the fine-tuning distribution as measured by their likelihood under the fine-tuning distribution (Figure 5). In other words, the fine-tuned model performs more like the pretrained model on tasks that are far from the fine-tuning distribution. We hypothesize this is because transformers are implicitly \u201cinferring\u201d the task before solving the corresponding task. The fine-tuning process might not significantly change the capability to solve tasks (inside and outside the fine-tuning distribution), but rather skew the task inference heavily towards the fine-tuning task distribution, disproportionately affecting tasks close to but outside the fine-tuning distribution. Assuming this framework, we can recover the suppressed pretraining capability by forcing a prompt to look very different from the fine-tuning distribution, helping the fine-tuned model infer that the task is outside the fine-tuning distribution. To do this, we propose Conjugate Prompting. For a prompt P outside the fine-tuning distribution, we prompt the language model with prompt P \u2032 such that (i) P \u2032 is less likely under the fine-tuning distribution and (ii) the solution to prompt P can be easily recovered from the solution to prompt P \u2032. Since P \u2032 is farther from the fine-tuning distribution than P , the fine-tuned model will solve P \u2032 with the pretrained capability, allowing us to extract a better solution for the original task P . We test our conjugate prompting method in the linear regression setup and find that it alleviates some of the trade-offs induced by fine-tuning (Figure 6). Drawing inspiration from the synthetic experiments, we validate whether fine-tuning affects real language models in the same manner. Since fine-tuning datasets are curated and primarily in English, we apply conjugate prompting with language translation to lower the likelihood of being drawn from the fine-tuning distribution while preserving the core task. We construct a problem where it is ambiguous whether the correct task is in-context learning or following an instruction and find that instruction-tuning suppresses in-context learning. Across 5 models and 4 non-English languages (with 2 additional transformations), conjugate prompting recovers the pretrained capability of in-context learning. We also consider the problem of harmful content generation where language models like ChatGPT are actively fine-tuned to suppress the capability of answering harmful instructions: here it is in an adversary\u2019s interest to recover suppressed capabilities of pretraining. We find that conjugate prompting can still circumvent the fine-tuned capability of refusal of harmful instructions and recover the pretrained capability of following the instruction."

Inspired by previous works (Garg et al., 2023; Akyu\u0308rek et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023), we focus on linear regression for noisy data, where every function is given by fw : x 7\u2192 \u27e8w, x\u27e9 for a fixed w \u2208 Rd. We are given a set of samples S of variable length k from 0 to maximum length N such that\nS = {(x1, y1), . . . , (xk, yk)} , (1)\nwith yi = fw(xi)+ \u03f5i and \u03f5i \u223c N (0, \u03c32). From this, a model estimates the output yquery for a given input xquery. We will refer to an instance from our function class fw as a task, and when it is clear from context, we will refer to tasks by the associated weight vector w. In this section, all inputs will be sampled from the normal distribution via xi \u223c N (0, Id).\nTraining an auto-regressive model. We consider auto-regressive models T\u03b8 that take in a sequence of tokens, each in Rd, and produce a real-valued output. For samples S generated under w as in Equation 1, we feed the model T\u03b8 the sequence [x1, y1, . . . , xk, yk, xquery]1 (which we will refer to as the prompt) and take its output y\u0302 as a prediction of yquery. When appropriate, we will refer to the xi\u2019s in the prompt as X \u2208 Rk\u00d7d and the yi\u2019s as y \u2208 Rk. We train and evaluate T\u03b8 with respect to a weight distribution D via the quadratic loss\nL(\u03b8,D) = N\u2211\nk=0\nE xi\u223cN (0,Id)\nw\u223cD \u03f5i\u223cN (0,\u03c32)\n[ (T\u03b8 ([x1, y1, . . . , xk, yk, xquery])\u2212 yquery)2 ] . (2)\nby sampling a fresh batch of x,w, \u03f5 in each step. Under the quadratic loss, the optimal output is E [fw(xquery) + \u03f5 | X, y] = \u27e8E [w | X, y] , xquery\u27e9. For our model, we use a 22.4 million paramater GPT-2 style transformer. For a comprehensive explanation of our experimental setup, refer to Appendix B.5.\n2.2 GAUSSIAN PRIOR OVER WEIGHTS (DCONT)\nPrior work on learning linear functions (Garg et al., 2023; Akyu\u0308rek et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023) assumes weights are sampled from a Gaussian prior Dcont = N (0, \u03c42Id), which we will refer to as the \u201ccontinuous distribution\u201d. In this case, the Bayes optimal predictor performs ridge regression:\nw\u2217cont(X, y) = E [w | X, y] = ( X\u22a4X + \u03c32\n\u03c42 Id\n)\u22121 X\u22a4y. (3)\nAs noted in prior work, for most values of \u03c4, \u03c3, a converged transformer\u2019s predictions closely match the Bayes optimal predictor when evaluated on new weight vectors from the same Gaussian prior. We replicate this for \u03c4 = 1 in Figure 2, left.\n2.3 DISCRETE PRIOR OVER FIXED WEIGHTS (DDISC)\nThe Gaussian prior spreads probability mass over a large region of weight vectors, but in real world distributions, there isn\u2019t such a \u201cuniform\u201d prior over the task space. Rather, there are a few common tasks (e.g. summarization or sentiment analysis) which frequently appear in the task distribution, and pretrained LLMs rely on these priors for producing outputs (Min et al., 2022b; Wei et al., 2023b; Pan et al., 2023). We take this scenario to the extreme and consider training over a \u201cfixed\u201d set of weights with the distribution Ddisc sampling w uniformly from {w1, . . . , wn}. We refer to this as the \u201cdiscrete distribution\u201d. For our experiments, we set n = 64 and fix each wi as an independent sample of N (0, Id). With this new prior over the weights, ridge regression is no longer the optimal solution. The Bayes optimal estimator for Ddisc is:\nw\u2217disc(X, y) = \u2211 w\u2208W w\u03c6 ((y \u2212Xw)/\u03c3)\u2211 w\u2208W \u03c6 ((y \u2212Xw)/\u03c3) , (4)\nwhere \u03c6 (\u00b7) is the density of the standard multivariate normal distribution (derivation in Appendix A.1). We refer to this estimator as discrete regression. After training for sufficiently many steps, we find that the Transformer achieves the same loss as the Bayes-optimal estimator w\u2217disc, clearly outperforming ridge regression on the fixed set of weights (Figure 2, right).\n2.4 PRETRAINING OVER THE MIXTURE (DMIX)\nWe know that web-scale pretraining data is heavy-tailed, consisting of some important tasks seen often (similar to Ddisc), as well a large number of diverse tasks each seen rarely (similar to Dcont). To best model this structure, we consider the mixture of the continuous and discrete distributions, which we refer to as the \u201cmixture distribution\u201d\nDmix = \u03b1Ddisc + (1\u2212 \u03b1)Dcont (5)\nfor a scalar \u03b1. The Bayes optimal estimator for this mixture distribution takes the form\nw\u2217mix(X, y) = g(X, y)w \u2217 disc(X, y) + (1\u2212 g(X, y))w\u2217cont(X, y), (6)\nwhere g(X, y) is the posterior probability that the prompt X, y was sampled from Ddisc (complete expression and derivation in Appendix A.1). Intuitively, the Bayes optimal predictor utilizes ridge regression to get w\u2217cont and discrete regression to get w \u2217 disc which it appropriately weights by the posterior. We refer to this solution as mixture regression.\nMixture regression demonstrates a trade-off. For a given \u03b1, we measure model performance by evaluating its loss on the continuous and discrete distributions. For mixture regression, there is a natural trade-off between performance on these distributions based on the prior determined by \u03b1 as pictured by the black curve in Figure 3. For \u03b1 close to 0, mixture regression heavily weights ridge regression, while for \u03b1 close to 1, it weights discrete regression. For intermediate \u03b1, mixture regression can utilize the posterior to infer the distribution and get low loss on both Dcont and Ddisc.\nPretrained models approach mixture regression. We can similarly measure the loss of transformers evaluated on the continuous and discrete distributions. We find that as we train models for\nlonger on the mixture distribution, they approach the Bayes-optimal solution of mixture regression for the respective \u03b1. However, this convergence is very slow, especially for smaller values like \u03b1 = 0.2. Moreover, even a converged model is bounded in how well it can perform on the discrete distribution due to the trade-off presented by mixture regression."

            "text": "In practice, there is often a distributional mismatch between the tasks the model learned to solve during pretraining and the tasks of interest to an end user. For example, training for next token prediction over internet data doesn\u2019t naturally respond to human-written instructions or avoid outputting toxic content. Additionally, pre-training on all tasks is not a data-efficient nor compute-efficient method to improve performance on a specific target application. The most common solution to these problems is to fine-tune the pretrained model over the tasks of interest. We replicate this in our controlled setup by targeting performance on the fixed set of discrete tasks in Ddisc which requires the model to perform discrete regression (Equation 4). Fine-tuning is necessary since pretraining is both inefficient and limited by the distributional mismatch.\nFine-tuning helps for Ddisc and hurts Dcont. Fine-tuning the pretrained models from Section 2.4 over Ddisc rapidly improves performance on Ddisc, demonstrating the utility of fine-tuning. However, this also leads to large performance drops on Dcont. For example, as seen in Figure 4, when we finetune a transformer pretrained over Dmix for \u03b1 = 0.5, the loss decreases on Ddisc while it increases on Dcont. This is an instance of \u201ccatastrophic forgetting\u201d (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989), where finetuning a model to improve at one task causes it to worsen at other tasks. This performance drop could imply that the model can not perform ridge regression anymore. Thanks to our synthetic setup, we investigate how fine-tuning is affecting model predictions and utilize this understanding to recover lost performance on the continuous distribution."

We find that the change in loss incurred by fine-tuning is not uniform over all prompts and depends on the likelihood that the prompt was sampled from the fine-tuning distribution Ddisc. In Figure 5, we see how the change in loss induced by fine-tuning varies with the likelihood of being drawn from the fine-tuning distribution. For prompts that are likely to be drawn from the fine-tuning distribution, the loss increases as we lower the likelihood. This lines up with the standard intuition that models will have stronger performance for inputs that are in-distribution and worse performance for inputs that are out-of-distribution. However, this trend does not continue forever and in fact reverses for the continuous prompts. As the likelihood continues to decrease, the model improves performance, running counter to standard intuition about out-of-distribution inputs. With this understanding of how fine-tuning affects model predictions unevenly, we can better probe what function the fine-tuned model has learned.\nFigure 5: Change in loss vs density under Ddisc. We sample 2048 prompts of 10 exemplars from the continuous distribution (orange) and discrete distribution (blue). For each prompt, we evaluate the log likelihood of being drawn under Ddisc. We also evaluate how much the loss of the \u03b1 = 0.5 model changed before and after finetuning (scaled by the norm of the task vector). We use a binned scatterplot to show the mean and standard deviation over 10 bins of the data. We find the largest increase for the samples of the discrete distribution that are closest to the continuous distribution. We demonstrate this effect for more exemplar counts and pretrained models in Appendix B.1."

Due to our limited mechanistic understanding of transformers, we can not test whether this is how language models compute solutions. However, we can utilize this framework as an assumption to develop insight into what function is learned by the model. Assuming this framework, catastrophic forgetting can be seen as task inference up-weighting finetuning tasks and potential degrading pretraining capabilities. However, from Figure 4, we see that the loss on Dcont jumps abruptly as we fine-tune, suggesting that the model is more likely to have learned to down-weight the ridge regression solution rather than completely \u201cunlearn\u201d any internal implementation of ridge regression within a few steps. We hypothesize that during fine-tuning, the drop in performance on the continuous distribution is largely driven by altered task inference, i.e. for a prompt X, y from Dcont, g\u03b8(X, y) is larger due to the fine-tuning updates. We also hypothesize that the ridge regression and discrete regression capabilities are somewhat preserved."

Since we do not what function the transformer is precisely implementing, this is infeasible, so we try to change the prompt instead. Specifically, for X, y generated under task w, we consider the scaled prompt X, \u03b3y for a scale factor \u03b3. The scaled prompt X, \u03b3y is a valid linear regression problem generated under task \u03b3w with noise \u03b3\u03f5. Since a sufficiently large \u03b3 will decrease the true posterior g(X, y) for all \u03b1, we expect that g\u03b8(X, \u03b3y) would be lower than g\u03b8(X, y), weighting the model output towards ridge regression. Under this scaling, the loss-optimal prediction for the scaled prompt X, \u03b3y would correspond to \u27e8\u03b3w, xquery\u27e9, which is simply the loss-optimal prediction for the prompt X, y scaled by \u03b3. Therefore, to make the model perform ridge regression instead of discrete regression, we compose our insights into the following prompting strategy. Instead of directly feeding our prompt into the model, we scale the labels \u03b3, feed the model the scaled prompt, and scale down the model output. This should recover ridge regression if the model can perform ridge regression for the scaled prompt and if our hypothesis is true. This strategy is an instance of conjugate prompting, which we generalize in Section 3.\nConjugate prompting recovers ridge regression. We evaluate this strategy in our ridge regression setup in Figure 6. We find that in line with our hypothesis, conjugate prompting can help improve performance for fine-tuned models. Specifically, we observe that the strategy helps at low\nsample counts where it is truly ambiguous whether the prompt is drawn from the continuous or discrete distribution. At higher sample counts, the benefits of conjugate prompting are not observed since there is little ambiguity to resolve, and scaling the prompt simply tests a potentially harder task. Since we can get closer to ridge regression through conjugate prompting, we claim the ridge regression solution has not been \u201cforgotten\u201d but \u201csuppressed\u201d since it can be partially recovered through manipulating task inference."

We interested in generalizing this strategy to recover capabilities learnt and utilized during pretraining but not during fine-tuning. We can take advantage of this observation to design a novel prompting strategy that requires a transform s from the original prompt P to a new prompt P \u2032 satisfying two important properties:\n1. (Lower likelihood) P \u2032 should have lower likelihood under the fine-tuning distribution relative to P . This manipulates task inference in favor of the desired solution learnt at pretraining, ensuring that when evaluating P \u2032, the model will achieve lower loss.\n2.

            "text": "Instruction tuning is a common fine-tuning procedure to enable pretrained LLMs to follow natural language instructions. While instruction tuning improves instruction following ability, we find that it can come at the cost of other capabilities such as in-context learning. This is particularly amplified when the two tasks are at conflict with each other. For example, suppose the prompt contains exemplars corresponding to a latent task, but the final query xquery takes the form of an instruction (such as What is 2 + 2?). How well do models perform in-context learning in this setting? To test this, we generate prompts using the template in Figure 7, where there are different solutions conditioned on whether the task is in-context learning (ICL) or instruction following. See Appendix C.1 for full details on how these prompts were generated and Appendix C.2 for concrete examples. We find that fine-tuned models are always less likely to perform in-context learning compared to their pre-trained counterparts: Alpaca and Vicuna-7b perform ICL on 56.75% and 40.00% less inputs than LLaMa-7b and OPT-IML-1.3b performs ICL on 21.00% less inputs than OPT-1.3b. We can contextualize this drop in ICL with fine-tuning under the implicit inference framework of Section 2.7. Let L(prompt) denote the probability distribution over possible completions by an LLM given prompt. Let LIF denote this distribution conditioned on a model that always performs the task of instruction following, and let LICL denote the counter part for ICL. As per our hypothesis, we can write our model L as\nL(prompt) = g\u03b8(prompt)LIF(prompt) + (1\u2212 g\u03b8(prompt))LICL(prompt),\nwhere the model internally estimates g\u03b8 which is the posterior likelihood of the model interpreting the latent task to be instruction following. Our hypothesis predicts that one reason instruction-tuned models are worse at ICL is because instruction-tuning increases g\u03b8 for most prompts, suppressing the in-context learning capability LICL. Note that there might also be a change in the internal representations of LICL and LIF, but we only focus on what can be recovered by simply manipulating the task inference. If this were true, conjugate prompting (see Section 3) can reverse the effect of g and would cause the fine-tuned model to perform ICL more often.\nConjugate prompting to perform ICL over instruction following. We observe that the instruction tuning data for Alpaca, Vicuna, and OPT-IML are primarily in English. As a result, translating prompts to different languages satisfies the \u201clower likelihood\u201d property of conjugate prompting (Section 3). Language translation also satisfies the \u201cinvertibility\u201d property because we can simply reverse-translate the answer to English for the tasks we consider 2. Furthermore, the pretrained models we consider are capable of performing ICL in different languages. Other than language translation, we find that the additional transformations of Leetspeak and Pig Latin (also discussed in Wei et al. (2023a)) satisfy these properties. We test whether language translation biases the fine-tuned model more towards pretrained behavior of ICL. To do so, we compute the drop in ICL frequency between the fine-tuned and pretrained counterparts across several languages, with translation implemented Google Translate (Wu et al.,\n2Language translation might violate the task invertibility if we consider tasks that require specific contextual knowledge that might vary across languages\n2016). We present comprehensive results across 5 models, 4 non-English languages, and 2 additional transformations in in Table 1. We see that translation always results in a smaller drop in ICL frequency compared to English prompts (except for by 0.25% for one model pair for one language). For example, with Alpaca, Leetspeak results in a drop of only 1.0%, French shows a drop of 29.00%, while in contrast English results in a much larger drop of 56.75%. This confirms that conjugate prompting can successfully revert task inference and this change can often be significant in practice. We provide a more detailed decomposition of these accuracies in Appendix C.3."

In the context of our prior results, when we view language models as implicitly inferring the task, fine-tuning may be suppressing LANSWER rather than forgetting it. Moreover, we expect that fine-tuning is primarily in English since preference data labelling is much more expensive and less diverse than unsupervised pretraining data (Hao, 2023). To test this claim, we test conjugate prompting to recover language model behavior before safety fine-tuning. Specifically, we test GPT-3.5 before and after fine-tuning for conversational dialogue 3. For our prompts, we sample 100 instructions from AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023). We say that the model output reflects the ANSWER task if it attempts to answer the question, and otherwise reflects the REFUSE task if it is a refusal or an answer to a different question 4. We provide concrete details for our setup and labelling guidelines in Appendix D.1 as well as examples of harmful instructions, model completions, and labels in Appendix D.2. As can be seen in Table 2, fine-tuning takes the answer frequency from 92% to 3% in English. Similar to Section 4.1, we test whether we can apply conjugate prompting via language translation to recover the pretrained capability of answering harmful instructions. In line with our hypothesis, we find that the drop in performing the ANSWER task is always lower in non-English languages. For example, fine-tuning took the English ANSWER frequency from 92% to 3% while it took the Malayalam ANSWER frequency from 71% to 65%. Therefore, we claim that LANSWER is not forgotten, and conjugate prompting can recover this capability.

Catastrophic forgetting and continual learning. The general phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting where training on new tasks degrades performance on old tasks has been widely reported and studied (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Kemker et al., 2017). There have been many attempts to address this problem, in what is customarily referred to as continual learning, via regularization or data replay (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Parisi et al., 2019; Peng & Risteski, 2022). In this work, we focus on the setting of fine-tuning in LLMs where we find more structure in the exact nature of catastrophic forgetting. This allows us to devise a prompting strategy to recover pretraining capabilities with no change to the actual fine-tuning procedure. Prompting in different languages. Prior works have studied the multilingual capabilities of language models (Shi et al., 2022; Ahuja et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2022). The general finding is that transformers will best complete tasks in English with varying levels of performance drops in other languages. In this work, we focus on the disparity between pretraining and fine-tuning process across different languages (Hao, 2023). Adversarial Attacks. Prior work and tweets have studied how to \u201cjailbreak\u201d LLMs to elicit undesirable content (Shin et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021; Carlini et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). Specific instantiations of our conjugate prompting framework are closely related to some prior works. Ippolito et al. (2022) utilizes style transfer to circumvent hard-coded defenses for memorization-based attacks. In recent concurrent work, Wei et al. (2023a) report a similar finding of the possibility of jailbreaking via translation. We hope our work provides a unified perspective on such findings, along with a possible explanation via our hypothesis of shifting implicit inference. Multi-task learning and meta-learning. The objective of learning to solve multiple tasks simultaneously falls under the broad umbrella of meta-learning (Finn et al., 2017; Kirsch & Schmidhuber, 2022; Andrychowicz et al., 2016) and multi-task learning (Evgeniou & Pontil, 2004; Radford et al., 2019). Within this literature, the work on (Yin et al., 2020) provides an algorithm that allows for control over whether meta-learners utilize solutions to known tasks or generalize to new tasks. This is similar in objective to conjugate prompting but we focus only on manipulating the input rather than modifying the fine-tuning procedure."

            "text": "We find that the apparent catastrophic effects of fine-tuning may be explained as shifting implicit task inference. We demonstrate that for fine-tuned models, transforming prompts to look dissimilar to the fine-tuning data via conjugate prompting can recover pretrained capabilities. Contrary to heuristic prompt engineering, we provide a principled mechanism by which our strategy can recover pretraining performance. We acknowledge that using the pretrained model is a more direct way to obtain pretrained behavior when desired, but in the increasingly common blackbox API setting, we do not have access to all stages of model training (such as LLaMa-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) and Claude). As such, conjugate prompting is also a warning that simply restricting access to only safety-finetuned models is not secure\u2014we can still extract the pretrained behavior. More than the immediate utility of conjugate prompting, we hope that our analysis of fine-tuning brings us closer to principled adaptation of pretrained models to applications of interest. We believe that our inference hypothesis opens up a number of interesting questions in terms of whether transformers explicitly execute task inference. A more mechanistic understanding of our phenomenon is still missing\u2014are there sub-networks that perform task inference and capabilities, and could we manipulate these networks directly? Finally, it would also be interesting to develop better finetuning procedures, perhaps inspired by the continual learning and meta-learning literature. Better fine-tuning methods accompanied by a principled understanding would open up new avenues to guide task inference and leverage transformer capabilities, providing robust and steerable methods for deployment.\nBroader Impact. The primary motivation of this work is to offer a principled understanding of the process of fine-tuning, in order to make fine-tuning more efficient and reliable. We acknowledge that\nour current analysis reveals gaps in fine-tuning which could potentially be exploited to bypass safety measures introduced when fine-tuning. However, this work does not directly create new attacks or expose new vulnerabilities. Instead, we offer an explanation unifying the success of various existing manual attempts at bypassing safety fine-tuning. We hope our work contributes to the open discussion of limitations of current methods in containing the potential dangers posed by LLMs, and opens up new avenues for further research into the safety and reliability of these systems."

The specific instantiation of conjugate prompting through language translation may not be perfect since it relies on third-party services (e.g. Google Translate), is of lower quality in low-resource languages, and may not preserve the task for problems that rely on the language (e.g. famous quotes). Moreover, conjugate prompting requires domainspecific understanding of the tasks in the fine-tuning data and the task of interest."

In this section, we demonstrate the phenomenon in Figure 5 across sample counts in {5, 10, 15} and \u03b1 \u2208 {0.2, 0.5, 0.8}. Barring noise from finite sampling, we observe that our trend continues to hold up, with the largest increase in loss incurred for the points sampled from the continuous distribution that are likeliest to be drawn from the discrete distribution. We could not run this experiment for larger sample counts due to numerical instability in our estimate of the density under Ddisc.\nB.2 CONJUGATE PROMPTING FOR MORE \u03b1 AND \u03b3\nIn Section 2.8, we discussed how conjugate prompting can recover pretrained capabilities for models fine-tuned in Ddisc. In this section, we demonstrate this phenomenon for models pre-trained with \u03b1 \u2208 {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9}, fine-tuned on Ddisc (\u03b1 = 1.0), and labels scaled by \u03b3 \u2208 {1.5, 2.0, 3.0}. We show our results in Figure 10. We find that conjugate prompting helps, though \u03b3 = 3.0 starts to deterioriate the gains of improving task inference. We suspect this is because the pretrained model hasn\u2019t generalized this far out-of-distribution, as also investigated in Garg et al. (2023). Moreover, conjugate prompting helps the most for highest \u03b1, and we suspect this is because the model\u2019s prior on Ddisc is effectively higher for these fine-tuned model.\nFigure 11: Training over the discrete distribution first achieves good continuous loss. At the start of training, the model learns a function closer to the ridge regression solution.

At the start, the model achieves the same loss on the continuous and discrete task distributions, suggesting that it is applying the same function without leveraging the discrete prior. At its best continuous loss, the model has learnt a solution close to ridge regression for both distributions. Therefore, the model first learns linear regression and almost seems to forget this solution as it learns discrete regression. This constitutes an interesting setting for future work to study generalization and simplicity bias in transformers."
