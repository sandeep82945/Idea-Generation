 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a larger, multi-center study with more patients to better understand the relationship between ATIII levels and VTE rates in different surgical subgroups. The current study was limited by a small sample size.

2. Investigate the impact of VTE prophylaxis and FFP transfusion on modifying VTE rates and outcomes in patients with low ATIII levels. The current study did not account for these interventions. 

3. Examine the role of underlying coagulopathies like malignancy in contributing to VTE in patients with low ATIII levels. The current study did not account for these conditions.

4. Standardize the timing of when ATIII levels are drawn after SICU admission to better delineate the relationship between ATIII levels and VTE. The current study drew levels at variable times. 

5. Further analyze the complex relationship between ATIII levels and VTE specifically in trauma patients. The current study found conflicting results in this group that warrant more research.
