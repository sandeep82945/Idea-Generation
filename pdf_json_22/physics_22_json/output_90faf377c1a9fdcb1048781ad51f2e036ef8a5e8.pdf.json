    "abstractText": "In this paper, we study five-dimensional Dirac fermions of which the extra-dimension is compactified on quantum graphs. We find that there is a nontrivial correspondence between matrices specifying boundary conditions at the vertex of the quantum graphs and zero-dimensional Hamiltonians in gapped free-fermion systems. Based on the correspondence, we provide a complete topological classification of the boundary conditions in terms of noninteracting fermionic topological phases. The ten symmetry classes of topological phases are fully identified in the language of five-dimensional Dirac fermions, and topological numbers of the boundary conditions are given. In analogy with the bulk-boundary correspondence in noninteracting fermionic topological phases, the boundary condition topological numbers predict fourdimensional massless fermions localized at the vertex of the quantum graphs and thus govern the low energy physics in four dimensions.",

We find that there is a nontrivial correspondence between matrices specifying boundary conditions at the vertex of the quantum graphs and zero-dimensional Hamiltonians in gapped free-fermion systems. Based on the correspondence, we provide a complete topological classification of the boundary conditions in terms of noninteracting fermionic topological phases. The ten symmetry classes of topological phases are fully identified in the language of five-dimensional Dirac fermions, and topological numbers of the boundary conditions are given. In analogy with the bulk-boundary correspondence in noninteracting fermionic topological phases, the boundary condition topological numbers predict fourdimensional massless fermions localized at the vertex of the quantum graphs and thus govern the low energy physics in four dimensions.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.085006\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA quantum graph is a one-dimensional (1D) graph that consists of edges and vertices connected to each other with differential operators defined on each edge like Fig. 1 (see [1,2] for a review of the quantum graph). The quantum graph describes quantum mechanics on a 1D graph and has been paid attention to since we can obtain attractive physics caused by the degrees of freedom in boundary conditions for wave functions imposed at vertices from the requirement of current conservation. The graph has been applied to the wide range of research areas, e.g. scattering theory on 1D graphs [3\u20136], quantum chaos [7\u20139], anyons [10\u201312], supersymmetric quantum mechanics [13\u201315], Berry\u2019s phases [16\u201319], extra-dimensional models [20\u201330] and so on. Here we focus on applying quantum graphs to the extra space of 5D fermions, that is, 5D fermions with the extra\nspace given by the quantum graph. In the previous paper [31], three of the present authors and collaborators revealed that 5D fermions on quantum graphs could naturally solve the problems of the fermion generation, namely the fermion mass hierarchy and the origin of the CP-violating phase in the standard model. However, the possible 4D effective theories remained unclear because the parameter space of the boundary conditions was huge. Thus, the next step is a systematic investigation of the boundary conditions. A hint to this step is that we obtained 4D chiral zero modes localized at the vertex depending on the topological structure of the parameter space of the boundary conditions. This reminds us of topological insulators and superconductors, where gapless states appear on the boundaries by the topology in bulk from the bulk-boundary correspondence. These topological matters are classified into ten symmetry classes by the presence or absence of time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries [32\u201334].\n*t-inoue@stu.kobe-u.ac.jp \u2020dragon@kobe-u.ac.jp \u2021msato@yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp \u00a7ueba@tomakomai.kosen-ac.jp\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The boundary conditions are classified into ten symmetry classes by considering time reversal, charge conjugation, and extra spatial symmetries in 5D Dirac fermions. Surprisingly, the classification of the boundary conditions has a complete correspondence to the topological classification of 0\u00fe 1D gapped free-fermion systems: A Hermitian matrix that specifies the boundary conditions of quantum graphs corresponds to a zero-dimensional Hamiltonian for topological insulators and superconductors. In addition, symmetry classes of the boundary conditions coincide with those in the topological matter side. This means that the restrictions for the boundary conditions by the symmetries of 5D fermions are the same as those for zero-dimensional Hamiltonians with the AltlandZirnbauder symmetries. Furthermore, we obtain the topological numbers Z;Z2; 2Z for each symmetry class of the boundary conditions in the same manner as those of topological insulators and superconductors. Importantly, these numbers predict the number of 4D massless fields localized at the vertex of quantum graphs, i.e. the Z and 2Z indices are equal to the number of Kaluza-Klein (KK) chiral zero modes, and the Z2 index coincides with the parity of the number of Dirac zero modes. These zero modes would be regarded as gapless boundary states of topological phases. A similar relation between boundary conditions and 1\u00fe 1D symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases [35] or 1\u00fe 2D SPT phases [36] has been known in the boundary conformal field theories. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the relation between the boundary conditions on quantum graphs and 1\u00fe 0d SPT phases. This paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we briefly review 5D Dirac fermions on quantum graphs. Quantum graphs provide the most general 1D extra compactified spaces. In particular, we consider the socalled rose graph where any edge of the graph forms a loop that begins and ends at a common vertex, as shown in Fig. 2. This choice does not lose the generality because the rose graph can generate an arbitrary graph with the same number of edges by imposing suitable boundary conditions for wave functions at the vertex. See Fig. 3.1 In Sec. III, we classify allowed boundary conditions in the rose graph subject to symmetries of 5D fermions and obtain ten symmetry classes. Then we relate them to Hamiltonians and symmetries in the gapped free-fermion systems. In\nSec. IV, we investigate the topological number of the boundary conditions in each symmetry class and the number of KK zero modes. Section V is devoted to summary and discussion.\nII. 5D DIRAC FERMION ON QUANTUM GRAPH\nIn this section, we briefly review the properties of a 5D Dirac fermion on a quantum graph given in the previous paper [31]. As discussed in Sec. I, we take the extra space as the rose graph which consists of one vertex and N loops with the length La\u00f0a \u00bc 1;\u2026; N\u00de shown in Fig. 4. We consider a KK decomposition of the 5D field and derive boundary conditions that the field should satisfy at the vertex in the graph. We also discuss how the degeneracy of 4D chiral zero-modes depend on the boundary conditions and show that it corresponds to the topological invariant socalled Witten index."

Thus, this boundary condition decomposes the rose graph into isolated edges with the Dirichlet boundary conditions at both ends. The other graphs can also be obtained by suitable boundary conditions. Thus, we can collectively investigate any 1D extra space with N edges by using a single rose graph with N edges.\n085006-2\nIt should be noted that the model in Eq. (2.1) can realize the domain wall fermion used in the lattice gauge theory [37] as a special case. The domain wall configuration is obtained by a circular rose graph consisting of two edges and two vertices, where the bulk mass has an opposite sign on the two edges. Each vertex of this graph supports a 4D chiral fermion, of which chirality is opposite to each other on the two vertices. In the long length limit of the edges, the two 4D chiral fermions are decoupled to each other, so a chiral theory is realized effectively. Because rose graphs allow configurations other than the domain wall, our quantum graph approach is more general than that of the domain wall fermions. The action principle \u03b4S \u00bc 0 gives the 5D Dirac equation\n\u00bdi\u03b3\u03bc\u2202\u03bc \u00fe i\u03b3y\u2202y \u00feM \u03a8\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00bc 0; \u00f02:4\u00de and also the condition for the surface term\nXN a\u00bc1 \u00bd\u03a8\u0304\u00f0x; y\u00de\u03b3y\u03b4\u03a8\u00f0x; y\u00de y\u00bcLa\u2212\u03b5y\u00bcLa\u22121\u00fe\u03b5 \u00bc 0; \u00f02:5\u00de\nwhere \u03b5 is an infinitesimal positive constant.

(2.35) and (2.36). Therefore, for the type \u00f02N \u2212 k; k\u00de BC, we can conclude that the degeneracy of zero mode f\u00f0i\u00de0 \u00f0y\u00de is given by Nf0 \u00bc N \u2212 l, and that of zero mode g\u00f0i\u00de0 \u00f0y\u00de is given by Ng0 \u00bc k \u2212 l. The degeneracies Nf0 and Ng0 for each boundary condition are described in Table I. We also comment about phenomenological aspects of this model. In the case of the type (2N \u2212 k, k) BC, there are jN \u2212 kj massless chiral fields in the 4D effective theory since pairs of left and right-handed chiral zero modes can form massless Dirac spinors (and these may become massive through quantum corrections if we introduce interactions). Therefore, we can obtain three generations of chiral fermions for the type (N \u2212 3, N \u00fe 3) and (N \u00fe 3, N \u2212 3) BCs. Since the zero mode functions are exponentially localized at some boundaries, overlap integrals of the mode functions can easily produce hierarchical masses and also the flavor mixing if we introduce the 5D Yukawa interactions. Moreover, complex parameters in the matrix UB generally give the genuine complex zero mode functions and this would result in the CP violating phase in the CKM (Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa) matrix. Therefore, we can find that this model has the desired properties to explain the fermion flavor structure in the standard model from the viewpoint of higher dimensional theories.\n085006-6"

In the supersymmetric quantum mechanics, it is known that there is a topological invariant which is called the Witten index \u0394W. This index is defined by the difference of the number of the zero energy states with the eigenvalue \u00f0\u22121\u00deF \u00bc \u00fe1 and with \u00f0\u22121\u00deF \u00bc \u22121.

It should be emphasized that even if the 5D Dirac equation or action is invariant under some transformations, our model does not necessarily have those symmetries since transformed fields may not always satisfy the boundary conditions. Therefore, in order for our model\nto have the symmetries, additional restrictions should be on the boundary conditions at the vertex. Here, we introduce the time-reversal and charge conjugation symmetries combined with some extra-spatial symmetries and show that the boundary matrix UB can be classified into ten classes by those symmetries. We reveal these classes correspond to the ones in the classification of SPT phases of zero-dimensional noninteracting gapped fermions with the Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) symmetries, which gives the tenfold classification of topological insulators and superconductors. In this section, we will discuss the correspondence between the boundary matrix UB and the zero-dimensional Hamiltonian for the gapped free-fermion system, and also show that the symmetries in our model provide the restrictions for UB identical to the ones for the Hamiltonian from the AZ symmetries.

If there are such symmetries, we take the Hamiltonian as a block diagonal form and treat each irreducible block as the Hamiltonian H in (3.1)\u2013(3.3). The TRS and PHS are the antiunitary transformations whose squares should be \u00fe1 or \u22121. The CS is the unitary transformation and can be given by the product \u0393 \u00bc TC up to a phase. Here we take the CS as its square to be\u00fe1. This symmetry is always present when both the TRS and PHS are present, although the CS can be symmetry alone even if the TRS and PHS are absent. It should be noted that we can assume there are single TRS, PHS, and CS. For example, if there are two TRS such as T1 and T2, we can consider the unitary symmetry T1T2 which commutes with the Hamiltonian. Then the Hamiltonian can be taken to the block diagonal form and T1 and T2 are trivially related in each irreducible block, which is regarded as H in (3.1)\u2013(3.3). It is known that we can obtain total ten symmetry classes with topological numbers as shown in Table II [32\u201334]. These ten symmetry classes were originally introduced by A. Altland and M. R. Zirnbauer and are therefore called AZ symmetry classes [38,39]. The topological numbers Z, Z2 and 2Z in Table II indicate the presence of nontrivial topological insulators or superconductors. This topological classification is obtained by classifying symmetry-allowed mass terms in the Dirac Hamiltonian and the topological numbers correspond to the 0th homotopy groups of the\nclassifying spaces, which is the parameter space of the symmetry-allowed mass terms with taking the limit of an infinite number of energy bands. See Table III. These topological numbers characterize whether Hamiltonians can continuously deform to each other or not without closing a mass gap or breaking the symmetries. When they belong to the same symmetry class and have the same topological number, they can be continuously deformed to each other. One of the significant features of the topological\nTABLE III.

These correspond to the TRS, PHS and CS in the AZ symmetry classes. The matrix UB corresponds to the zero-dimensional Hamiltonian H in (3.1)\u2013 (3.3) and therefore we can classify UB into ten symmetry classes as in Table II for the d \u00bc 0 case. It should be noted that we assume only one of the same type symmetries such as T \u00fe and T \u2212 can be present so far. If both symmetries are present,Qy also becomes the symmetry independently sinceQy can be given by their product. In this case, we consider the identification of the \u00f0a\u00fe N=2\u00de-edge to a-edge (a \u00bc 1;\u2026; N=2) by the symmetry Qy with the eigenvalues Qy \u00bc \u00fe1 or Qy \u00bc \u22121, and then classify the boundary conditions of this reduced system. This identification effectively reduces the rose graph with N edges to the one with N=2 edges like the S1 is reduced to the interval by the Z2 orbifold, and the same type symmetries such as T \u00fe and T \u2212 are trivially related with each other after the identification. The symmetryQy requires that UB commutes with \u03c32 \u2297 1N from Eqs.

In the topological matter side, the topological numbers specify the\nnumber of gapless states which appear on boundaries.\nThen, the question is what do these topological numbers\nphysically mean in our model? In this section, we will reveal that these topological numbers correspond to the numbers of zero modes localized at the vertex in our model as summarized in Table V. The topological numbersZ and 2Z are related to theWitten index, which describes the number of chiral zero modes given in Sec. II D. By considering a sufficiently large number of the edges N, this number can take any integer values in the class A and AI and also any multiple of two in the class AII.

            "heading": "V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In this paper, we studied 5D fermions of which extra dimension is on quantum graphs. We showed that the boundary conditions of the quantum graphs are classified into ten symmetry classes according to the presence or absence of time-reversal, charge conjugation, and extra-spatial symmetries of 5D fermions. The obtained symmetry classes are identical to the AZ symmetry classes of SPT phases of gapped free-fermion systems. A Hermitian matrix UB specifying the boundary conditions corresponds to a 0d Hamiltonian of gapped free fermion systems. Furthermore, the constraints for UB originating from symmetries of 5D fermions are the same as those for the 0d Hamiltonian with AZ symmetries. Based on these results, we introduced topological numbers for the boundary conditions in the same manner as those of 0d topological insulators and superconductors. Importantly, the topological numbers of the\nboundary conditions coincide with the number of KK 4D chiral or Dirac fermions localized at the vertex of quantum graphs, which would be a generalization of the bulk-boundary correspondence for gapped free-fermion systems. Our classification implies that class A with no symmetries or class AI with the time-reversal symmetry is preferable for realizing the fermion flavor structure in the standard model. The nontrivial topological number Z in these classes may provide three generations of 4D chiral fermions.9 To fully reproduce the standard model in our quantum graph approach, we must investigate gauge fields on quantum graphs. (Higgs bosons can be obtained by five-dimensional gauge fields.) Although Refs. [25\u201329] take into account gauge fields, they consider the only simple boundary conditions such as the Dirichlet and Neumann conditions. In general graphs, more involved boundary conditions are possible for gauge fields. The boundary conditions for gauge fields are related to those of fermions by 5D gauge symmetry since the 5D fermions after the gauge transformation should satisfy the same boundary condition, which restricts an allowed gauge parameter space. This restriction affects the 4D spectra of the gauge fields and can induce gauge symmetry breaking. We should also take care of the gauge anomalies due to the 4D chiral fermions, but our quantum graph approach is based on a 5D theory, so it should be anomaly free. The anomalies of 4D chiral fermions at the vertex of quantum graphs are canceled with the contributions of massive modes at the edges of quantum graphs by the anomaly inflow mechanism [41\u201343]. The key point in the classification of the boundary conditions for the 5D fermions is the existence of chiral spinors in four dimensions. The Hermiticity of the boundary matrixUB originates from the independence of the left and right-handed chiral fields under the 4D Lorentz invariance. We expect that the same discussion works for general odd D-dimensional cases since chiral spinors exist in D \u2212 1 dimensions. In contrast, for even D-dimensions, we cannot apply the same discussions. In fact, the matrix for the boundary conditions is not generally Hermitian in even dimensions (See, e.g. [19]). We leave the extension of our results to other spacetime dimensions as a future problem. In particular, the investigations for lower dimensions would be important from the viewpoint of condensed matter physics. We are also interested in the correspondence to SPT phases in other dimensions. So far, we have discussed the\n9For example, Refs. [25\u201329] discuss the realization of the mass hierarchies and CP-violating phase by using the 1D extra space consisting of three line segments with the Dirichlet boundary conditions for fermions. This corresponds to the case with j\u0394W j \u00bc 3, and thus three generations of 4D chiral fermions appear.\n085006-24\nrelation between the boundary conditions for quantum graphs and 1\u00fe 0d SPT phases for gapped free fermion systems, assuming that the 4D spacetime and the extra dimension are factorized, and the boundary conditions on the extra space do not have a 4D momentum dependence. However, if we consider the boundary conditions depending on the 4D momentum (or equivalently the 4D derivative), the boundary condition matrix would be regarded as a higher dimensional Hamiltonian, and thus we may obtain the correspondence to SPT phases in other dimensions. Another future direction is the effect of interactions. So far, we have considered free fermions on quantum graphs. However, by considering interactions and also quantum corrections, the boundary conditions would be changed, and breakdowns of the topological phases may occur, which affects low-energy physics. For the topological matter side, it has been known that SPT phases of gapped free-fermion systems may break down by interactions preserving symmetries (see, e.g. [44\u201351]). For example,\nthe Z classification of class BDI for 1D topological superconductor reduces to the Z8 classification if quartic interactions are present. We are interested in whether a similar breakdown occurs in the topological classification of boundary conditions. It is also known that interacting SPT phases in bulk can be characterized by perturbative and/or nonperturbative anomalies on boundary [42,52\u201355]. This is described by an anomaly inflow. Thus, it could be interesting to consider the boundary conditions from the viewpoint of anomalies. We hope to revisit these issues in the near future."
