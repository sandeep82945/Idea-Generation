1. **Investigate the relationship between chemical pressure and physical properties in a wider range of materials.** The paper focuses on the effects of chemical pressure on magnetic, electric, and thermal properties, but it would be interesting to explore how chemical pressure affects other properties, such as mechanical, optical, and electronic properties.
2. **Develop new methods for quantifying chemical pressure.** The paper proposes two methods for quantifying chemical pressure, but these methods are based on experimental lattice strain and elastic modulus. It would be useful to develop more accurate and reliable methods for quantifying chemical pressure, especially for materials that are difficult to characterize experimentally.
3. **Explore the use of chemical pressure to design new materials with tailored properties.** The paper demonstrates how chemical pressure can be used to tune the properties of existing materials, but it would be interesting to explore how chemical pressure can be used to design new materials with entirely new properties.
4. **Investigate the effects of chemical pressure on the stability and performance of materials under extreme conditions.** The paper focuses on the effects of chemical pressure at ambient conditions, but it would be interesting to explore how chemical pressure affects the stability and performance of materials under extreme conditions, such as high pressure, high temperature, and radiation.
5. **Develop new theoretical models to describe the effects of chemical pressure on materials.** The paper provides a qualitative description of the effects of chemical pressure on materials, but it would be useful to develop more quantitative theoretical models that can predict the effects of chemical pressure on specific materials.
