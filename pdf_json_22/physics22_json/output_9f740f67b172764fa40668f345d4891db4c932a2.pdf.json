    "abstractText": "Backscatter communication (BackCom) has been envisioned as a prospective candidate for enabling the sustained operation of battery-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. This approach involves the transmission of information by a backscatter node (BSN) through passive reflection and modulation of an impinging radio-frequency (RF) signal. However, the short operational range and low data rates of contemporary BackCom systems render them insufficient on their own to provide ubiquitous connectivity among the plethora of IoT devices. Meanwhile, wireless networks are rapidly evolving towards the smart radio paradigm. Thus, to enhance the coverage range and capacity, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be incorporated into the existing BackCom systems. RISs employ passive reflective elements to adaptively configure the stochastic wireless environment in a cost-effective and energyefficient manner. Furthermore, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can be exploited to improve the spectral efficiency of the BackCom systems. In this paper, we present the design and bit error rate (BER) analysis of an RIS-enhanced NOMA-assisted bistatic BackCom system under Nakagami-m fading channel. Our extensive simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed system over the conventional NOMA-assisted BackCom system without RIS, and demonstrate the impact of various factors, including the power-reflection coefficients, RIS phase-shift designs, number of reflecting elements, RIS location, and split factor, on the BER performance of the proposed RIS-assisted system.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe sixth-generation (6G) of wireless communication aims to fulfill extremely high data rate and ultra-low latency requirements while supporting massive connectivity for empowering the diverse paradigms of wireless communications. The Internetof-things (IoT) paradigm is envisioned as one of the potential candidates for the provision of ubiquitous connectivity among the massive number of heterogeneous devices [1]. Nevertheless, despite the rapid evolution, the energy management of IoT devices is one of the crucial challenges hindering their largescale deployment. Conventional battery-based solutions are undesirable for the sustainable operation of IoT nodes in\ncase of deployment in an inaccessible environment and due to the associated cost-prohibitive system maintenance [2]. Consequently, various energy harvesting techniques are under investigation to overcome these challenges. Energy harvesting is a practical and viable approach for IoT networks because of the low energy requirements of IoT devices [2]. In this regard, backscatter communication (BackCom) has emerged as one of the promising energy harvesting solutions for powering the massive number of IoT devices in an energy-efficient and cost-effective manner [3], [4].\nBackCom allows the passive backscatter nodes (BSNs) to deliver information by modulating and reflecting the incident radio-frequency (RF) signal via the antenna impedance mismatch. Despite the extensive research on BackCom systems, the issue of limited coverage range and data rates persists [5], [6]. These limitations, along with the stochastic nature of wireless channels, are impeding their large-scale deployment. Therefore, some mechanism is required to support the massive connectivity and high data rate requirements while adapting to the dynamic nature of the wireless channel. In this regard, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have recently emerged as a promising new paradigm for the adaptive configuration of the radio propagation environment [4], [7].\nSpecifically, an RIS is a planar surface which is composed of a massive number of low-cost passive reflective elements, such as PIN diodes and printed dipole arrays, each capable of intelligently inducing a phase shift and/or amplitude change in the incident signal independently. Thus, the wireless channel between the communication terminals can be reconfigured to achieve the desired channel response. Through intelligent phase-shifts, RIS can either boost the signal to improve the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or attenuate the signal to mitigate the interference. RISs have conformal geometry, hence, they can be easily mounted on environmental objects, such as building facades, walls and ceilings [8].\nThe aforementioned features of RISs, and their compatibility with the existing wireless systems, make them an ideal candidate to assist BackCom systems [9]. The RIS-assisted\nbistatic BackCom system was first studied in [10], where the transmit beamforming vector at the CE, the RIS phase shifts, and the reflection coefficient at the BSNs, were jointly optimized to minimize the transmit power. In [11], performance analysis of RIS-aided BackCom system was studied, and the symbol error probability (SEP) for coherent and random phase-shift designs of RIS was analytically investigated. The authors in [12] investigated the joint optimization of reflection coefficients and RIS phase shifts for an RIS-enhanced NOMAassisted BackCom system. Moreover, a deep reinforcement learning (deepRL)-based approach for the joint optimization of reflection coefficients and RIS phase shifts for an RIS-assisted ambient BackCom system was presented in [13].\nDifferent from the aforementioned works, in this work, we consider an RIS-enhanced NOMA-assisted bistatic BackCom system. Power-domain NOMA is a promising multiple access technique, which serves multiple users on the same orthogonal resource block, resulting in improved spectral efficiency, massive connectivity, and better user fairness over the OMA techniques [4], [14]. We consider two users per NOMA cluster to ensure low complexity during the successive interference cancellation (SIC) process. In order to better exploit powerdomain NOMA (PD-NOMA), the reflection coefficients of the BSNs are assigned different values to establish a higher channel gain difference. The proposed system results in an improved bit error rate (BER) performance as compared to the conventional NOMA-assisted BackCom system. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.\n\u2022 We propose an RIS-enhanced NOMA-assisted BackCom system, where an RIS assists the backscattering communication between the BSNs and the BR. \u2022 The BER performance of the RIS-enhanced NOMAassisted bistatic BackCom system is studied under Nakagami-m fading and RIS elements splitting approach. \u2022 Our extensive simulation results show the impact of various factors, namely the transmit SNR, power-reflection coefficients, RIS phase-shift designs, number of reflecting elements, RIS location and split factor, on the BER performance of RIS-enhanced NOMA-assisted BackCom system.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the system model of the proposed RIS-enhanced NOMA-assisted BackCom system is described. Sec. III provides the simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Finally, conclusions are presented in Sec. IV."

Each passive reflective element has the capability to scatter the impinging signal with an induced phase-shift. We assume that each of the BSNs, BR, and CE is equipped with a single\nantenna. Let I = { 1 , . . . , I } denotes the set of BSNs and I = | I | denotes the maximum number of BSNs, where I \u2265 2 and | I | is the cardinality of set I. Since, the hardware complexity and processing delay due to SIC increases with an increasing number of BSNs per cluster, therefore, in this work, we assume I = 2."

The proposed system has two distinct transmission phases: (i) forward or excitation phase, where the CE transmits the CW signal to the BSNs; (ii) backscattering phase, where the BSNs backscatter the modulated signal towards the BR through both the direct and RIS reflected links.\n1) Training Phase: In a single cluster BackCom system with two BSNs, a training phase is employed to distinguish between the strong and weak BSN based on the channel state information (CSI). For this, each BSN backscatters the CW signal towards the BR in a separate time slot with the same value of power reflection coefficient. By comparing the instantaneous CSI, obtained from the received backscattered signals, the BR recognizes the strong/weak BSN. The BSNs then adjust their reflection coefficients, based on their CSI at the BR, to employ PD-NOMA.\n2) Operating States: The BSNs in the proposed system operate in one of the two states, either the active state or the energy harvesting state. We assume that the CE continuously transmits the CW signal. In the active state, the BSNs backscatter the modulated signal to the BR, whereas in the energy harvesting state, the BSNs harvest the energy from the CW signal. The harvested energy is stored in a battery to power the internal circuitry and perform sensory functions.\n3) BPSK Modulation: The modulation of the incident CW signal is done by varying the antenna impedance of the backscatter device, which in turn changes the value of the reflection coefficient. The BPSK modulation scheme is considered as it aligns with the complexity and energy constraints of the low-power BSNs. For BPSK, the antenna impedance is switched between the two impedance states,\nwhich generates two reflection coefficients with the same magnitude but a phase-shift of 180\u00b0."

Here, the assumption of a fading-free channel model is reasonable since the BSNs are in close proximity of the CE and have a strong line-of-sight (LoS) link with the CE. In addition, since the RIS is deployed close to the BR, therefore, the RIS reflected signal from the CE to the BSNs will be substantially attenuated due to the multiplicative path loss of the reflected link, and hence can be considered negligible.

We consider two feasible sets of phase-shifts \u03a61 and \u03a62, where \u03a61 = [0, 2\u03c0) is the set of continuous phaseshifts, and \u03a62 = {0,\u2206, . . . , (L \u2212 1)\u2206} is the set of discrete phase-shifts, obtained by uniformly quantizing the interval [0, 2\u03c0), where \u2206 = 2\u03c0/L, and L = 2b denotes the discrete phase-shift levels which have a b-bit resolution. w \u223c CN (0, \u03c32) is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and variance \u03c32.\nIt is assumed that all RIS elements reflect the impinging signals independently; consequently, there is no signal coupling in the reflection by the adjacent RIS elements. As such, the RIS reflected link can equivalently be represented as\ngHr \u0398fi = M\u2211 m=1 ej\u03b8m gr,m fi,m, (3)\n1We assume that the RIS does not attenuate the amplitude of the incident carrier wave. Hence, in the sequel of this paper, we set \u03b21 = \u03b22 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = \u03b2M = 1.\nwhere gr,m and fi,m denote the m-th element of gHr and fi, respectively, and \u03b8m is the phase of the m-th diagonal element of \u0398. In this work, we consider the surface partitioning concept [14], where the total number of RIS elements are split between the I BSNs. The distribution of elements is specified by the split factor \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], which is defined as\n\u03b1 = M1 M , (4)\nwhere M1 denotes the number of elements, rounded up to the nearest integer, configured for enhancing the performance of BSN-1 by a coherent combination of the direct and RIS reflected signals at the BR. On the other hand, M2 =M \u2212M1 are the elements configured for BSN-2 signal. Therefore, for the case of partitioned RIS, the RIS reflected link of the i-BSN can be written as\ngHr \u0398fi = \u2211 m\u2208Ci\nej\u03b8mgr,mfi,m\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Coherently optimized RIS elements for i-th BSN\n+ \u2211 k\u2208Ci\nej\u03b8kgr,kfi,k,\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Randomly configured\nRIS elements for i-th BSN\n(5)\nwhere Ci denotes the set of elements configured for the i-th BSN, while Ci denotes the set of elements which are not configured for the i-th BSN, and thus randomly combine the signal of i-th BSN.

Following the SIC scheme, the BR first decodes the data symbol of the strong BSN, i.e., BSN-1, and then subtracts it from the composite received signal to detect the data symbol of the weak BSN, i.e., BSN-2. Hence, the optimal decoding order is in the order of decreasing channel gains.\nThe receiver decodes the BSN-1\u2019s signal using the maximum likelihood detector (MLD), while treating the BSN2\u2019s signal as inter-user interference (IUI). By assuming the availability of perfect CSI at the receiver, the MLD for BSN-1\u2019s symbol can be described as\nx\u03021 = argmin x\u03031\u2208S\n\u2223\u2223\u2223y \u2212\u221a\u03931PT hb,1x\u03031\u2223\u2223\u22232 , (8)\nwhere x\u03021 and x\u03031 denote the estimated data symbol and the possible trial values of x1, respectively, and S = {+1,\u22121} is the set of all possible constellation points for BSN-1. If the BSN-1\u2019s symbol is detected correctly, there is no IUI while decoding BSN-2\u2019s symbol. However, in the case of incorrect detection of BSN-1\u2019s symbol, a bit error occurs that results in an error propagation from BSN-1, in the form of IUI, during the decoding of BSN-2\u2019s symbol. The MLD for BSN-2\u2019s symbol can then be described as\nx\u03022 = argmin x\u03032\u2208S \u2223\u2223\u2223(y \u2212\u221a\u03931PT hb,1x\u03021)\u2212\u221a\u03932PT hb,2x\u03032\u2223\u2223\u22232 , (9) where x\u03022 and x\u03032 denote the estimated data symbol and the possible trial value of x2, respectively. A bit error occurs when x\u03022 \u0338= x2."

As illustrated in Fig. 2, the RIS-enhanced system outperforms the conventional NOMA-BackCom system without an RIS.

BER plot for varying split factor, \u03b1, with M = 48 and SNR = 5 dB.\nRIS reflected signals are added coherently at the BR, which results in improved SNR of the RIS-enhanced system. However, the performance improvement in the low SNR regime is not that eminent due to the severe product-distance path loss experienced by the RIS reflected link.\nB. Impact of Elements Splitting\nThe performance of RIS-enhanced system highly depends on the number of configured RIS elements for each BSN. In this regard, the BER of BSN-1 and BSN-2 is plotted against the split factor, i.e., \u03b1, in Fig. 3. It can be observed that the performance of BSN-1 improves with the increase in \u03b1 since the allocation of more RIS elements to BSN-1 and fewer elements to BSN-2 increases the difference between the received signal strength of both BSNs. This leads to a lower IUI during the decoding of BSN-1\u2019s signal, which increases the probability of detecting the BSN-1\u2019s data symbol correctly. Consequently, the\nperformance of BSN-2 also improves as there is less probability of error propagation from BSN-1 during BSN-2\u2019s decoding.\nHowever, despite the low probability of error propagation from BSN-1, the performance of BSN-2 deteriorates when \u03b1 is higher than 0.60. This is because the increase in \u03b1 above the optimal value reduces the strength of the BSN-2\u2019s signal significantly, which increases the probability of incorrect decoding. Furthermore, it can be observed that for transmit SNR of 5 dB, the optimal value of a split factor is 0.60 since it provides the lowest BER for both BSNs.\nC. Impact of Phase-shift Designs\nFig. 4 compares the performance of the proposed RISNOMA-BackCom system for continuous, discrete and random discrete phase-shift designs. In the random discrete phase-shift design, the phase-shift for each element is randomly chosen from the set of discrete phase-shifts, i.e., \u03a62, while in discrete phase-shift design, the optimal phase-shifts are given by\n\u03c8m = argmin \u03d5\u2208\u03a62\n|\u03d5\u2212 \u03b8m| , (10)\nwhere \u03c8m is the optimal value of the discrete phase-shift for the m-th element of RIS.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4, the continuous phase-shift approach outperforms the discrete phase-shift designs for a given number of RIS elements and transmit SNR. However, it is infeasible to realize the continuous phase-shifts due to the high hardware cost and complexity [7]. Moreover, the discrete phaseshift design with 1-bit resolution has a better performance than the random discrete phase-shift design with the same resolution. In addition, the performance of discrete phase-shift design can be enhanced by increasing the number of quantization levels."

In this regard,\nFig. 5 compares the BER performance for M = 24 and RIS located at (40, 10) and (50, 10) m. It can be observed that the BER performance improves by deploying RIS closer to the BR, owing to the reduced path loss of the RIS reflected backward link. The effect of total number of RIS elements on the BER performance for the RIS located at (50, 10) m is illustrated in Fig. 6. As expected, the performance improves when the number of RIS elements is increased. For instance, for 20 dB transmit SNR, the BER performance improves by approximately 80% when RIS elements increase from M = 24 to M = 32."

Moreover, it can be seen that a greater value of \u03932 is required to successfully decode the BSNs\u2019 signal at low transmit SNRs.\nIn Fig. 8, a contour plot of BER is plotted by varying the reflection coefficient, \u03932, and split factor, \u03b1, while keeping \u03931 as 1. It can be observed that for a fixed value of \u03932, there exists a range of \u03b1 values which can provide an acceptable BER performance. Moreover, as mentioned before, an increase in \u03932 deteriorates the system performance due to IUI in the decoding of BSN-1\u2019s signal. Moreover, the best BER performance is achieved when \u03932 is approximately 0.35 and \u03b1 is 0.6."

Our extensive simulation results clearly illustrated the performance gain achieved by integrating an RIS and demonstrated that the system performance can be significantly enhanced by increasing the number of reflecting elements, or by selecting the optimal values for split factor and power reflection coefficients without increasing the CE transmit power. Hence, this entails an optimization study as a future work where the split factor and the reflection coefficients can be jointly optimized for the provision of maximum system performance in terms of BER."
