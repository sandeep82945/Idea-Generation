    "abstractText": "Advances in quantum computation for electronic structure, and particularly heuristic quantum algorithms, create an ongoing need to characterize the performance and limitations of these methods. Here we discuss some potential pitfalls connected with the use of hardware-efficient Ans\u00e4tze in variational quantum simulations of electronic structure. We illustrate that hardware-efficient Ans\u00e4tze may break Hamiltonian symmetries and yield non-differentiable potential energy curves, in addition to the well-known difficulty of optimizing variational parameters. We discuss the interplay between these limitations by carrying out a comparative analysis of hardware-efficient Ans\u00e4tze versus unitary coupled cluster and full configuration interaction, and of secondand first-quantization strategies to encode fermionic degrees of freedom to qubits. Our analysis should be useful in understanding potential limitations and in identifying possible areas of improvement in hardware-efficient Ans\u00e4tze.",

Rice2, \u2217\n1Department of Chemistry, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA 2IBM Quantum, IBM Research Almaden, 650 Harry Road, San Jose, CA 95120, USA\nAdvances in quantum computation for electronic structure, and particularly heuristic quantum algorithms, create an ongoing need to characterize the performance and limitations of these methods. Here we discuss some potential pitfalls connected with the use of hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze in variational quantum simulations of electronic structure. We illustrate that hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze may break Hamiltonian symmetries and yield non-differentiable potential energy curves, in addition to the well-known difficulty of optimizing variational parameters. We discuss the interplay between these limitations by carrying out a comparative analysis of hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze versus unitary coupled cluster and full configuration interaction, and of second- and first-quantization strategies to encode fermionic degrees of freedom to qubits. Our analysis should be useful in understanding potential limitations and in identifying possible areas of improvement in hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nRecent years have witnessed remarkable research in the simulation of many-body quantum systems by quantum computing algorithms [1\u20136]. A prominent application targeted by quantum algorithms is the electronic structure (ES) problem, namely solving for the ground- or low-lying eigenstates of the electronic Schro\u0308dinger equation for atoms, molecules, and materials. Research in this direction has delivered important results in the calculation of potential energy curves, ground- and excited-state energies, and correlation functions [7\u201310] for various electronic systems.\nVariational quantum simulations are among the most widespread strategies to carry out ES calculations on quantum computers today [6, 11]. These include the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm [11]. Within VQE, one defines an Ansatz approximating the ground state of a target Hamiltonian, i.e. a set of wavefunctions obtained by applying a parametrized quantum circuit to an input state. Central to the accuracy and computational cost of a variational quantum simulation is the construction of an Ansatz with which to explore the space of approximate solutions to the target problem.\nHardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze [8] are families of wavefunctions designed with the primary goal of being compatible with the budget of near-term quantum hardware in terms of qubit number and connectivity, native gates of the device, and circuit depth. While hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze are a useful support in the demonstration of VQE and other variational quantum algorithms, their application to the ES problem remains to be fully understood and established.\nIn this study, we explore some potential pitfalls in the use of quantum computing hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze in ES theory, using deviations between the computed and exact (or full Configuration Interaction, FCI) properties as an indicator of algorithmic quality. We observe that hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze can break Hamiltonian symmetries, a conceptually important but often overlooked aspect of quantum simulations. Furthermore, shallow Ansa\u0308tze can yield non-differentiable potential energy curves, leading to ill-defined nuclear forces. Furthermore, the optimization of variational parameters is a challenging and expensive operation. Indeed, it is well-known that hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze can exhibit barren plateaus, where under certain conditions the gradient of the cost function vanishes exponentially with system size [12].\nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows: after describing the methods used in this work, we present and discuss the results of this study. Supporting Information (SI) contains additional computational and algorithmic details, together with the schema of a repository which can be used to store results from this study and other studies that evaluate the properties of new hardware Ansa\u0308tze."

The LiH, BH, HF, BeH and OH bond lengths R varied between 0.9-5.3, 0.7-3.5, 0.7-4.5, 0.7-4.5, and 0.7-3.3 A\u030a respectively. These molecular species, proposed in previous work [8, 10, 13], allow testing of hardware-efficient variational Ansa\u0308tze along the breaking of one (LiH, BH, and HF) or two (BeH2, and H2O) covalent bonds, and in the presence of dominant dynamic (small R) or static (medium to large R) electronic correlation.

            "text": "In the majority of quantum algorithms for contemporary devices, the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) and the auxiliary operators Eq. (2) are mapped onto linear combinations\nH\u0302 = np\u22121\u2211 i=0 ci \u03c3viwi , \u03c3vw = nq\u22121\u2297 k=0 \u03c3vkwk , (3)\nof Pauli operators acting on a certain number nq of qubits. In Equation (3) \u03c300,01,10,11 = 1, X, Z, Y is a single-qubit Pauli operator, ci a real-valued coefficient, and the summation ranges over np terms. The rationale behind this choice is that a Pauli operator acting on k qubits can be exponentiated with a circuit of up to 4k \u2212 1 gates and measured using a single layer of k single-qubit gates, which makes the representation Eq. (3) suitable for near-term quantum devices.\nIn this study, we employed both first-quantization and second-quantization encodings. First-quantization establishes a one-to-one mapping between the Hilbert space spanned by a set of K space- and spin-adapted configuration state functions (CSFs) and the Hilbert space of nq = \u2308log2K\u2309 qubits. Second-quantization establishes a one-to-one mapping between the Fock space of electrons inM spatial orbitals and the Hilbert space of nq = 2M qubits. First-quantization encodings automatically ensure access to symmetry-adapted many-electron wavefunctions and require fewer qubits than their second-quantization counterparts since \u2308log2K\u2309 \u2264 2M . Furthermore, first-quantization encodings lead to sparse operators which can be efficiently exponentiated [14], and the exponential operators can then be used to measure their expectation values with the quantum phase estimation algorithm [15]. Notwithstanding these desirable features of first-quantization encodings, the exponentiation of sparse operators and the use of such exponentials inside quantum phase estimation or variational algorithms are expensive operations, beyond the capabilities of near-term quantum devices. On these devices, operators are more conveniently expressed as linear combinations of a certain number np of Pauli operators acting on nq qubits. However, such first-quantization representations lead to an np that scales exponentially with nq. This translates to a polynomial scaling with K, which in turn increases combinatorially with system size. Additional technical details are provided in the following Subsection.\nSecond-quantization encodings give rise to a compact representation of the Hamiltonian and of auxiliary operators Eq. (2) as linear combinations of a polynomial number of Pauli operators [16, 17], but allow the possibility that Hamiltonian symmetries are broken (vide infra). The issue of symmetry-breaking can be alleviated in various ways. For example, one can restrain the expectation value of a target observable (e.g. spin) to a desired value by performing a variational optimization that includes a penalty term. While this strategy does not ensure access to an eigenstate of the target observable, deviations from an eigenstate can be assessed by computing variances, for example. Another way to alleviate symmetry-breaking is to project a wavefunction inside a target subspace of the Hilbert space. This\n3 projection removes symmetry-breaking by construction and allows assessment of the severity of symmetry-breaking by computing the expectation value of the projector.\nIn this work, in second-quantization simulations, we alleviated symmetry-breaking by combining the parity mapping with the two-qubit and tapering techniques [18, 19]. The former removes two qubits to ensure the conservation of the parity operators (\u22121)N\u0302\u2191 and (\u22121)N\u0302\u2193 , and the latter identifies a subgroup of the molecular orbital symmetry group isomorphic to Z\u00d7k2 and removes k qubits to ensure the simulated wavefunctions lie in a target irreducible representation of the identified abelian subgroup [18, 19]. The species studied here have molecular orbital symmetry groups (C\u221ev for LiH, BH and HF, D\u221eh for BeH2 and C2v for H2O) isomorphic to Z2 \u00d7 Z2 so that the combined use of two-qubit reduction and tapering leads to nq = 2M \u2212 2 for LiH (since the calculations on LiH used only 4 spin orbitals arising from 2s and 2pz), nq = 2M \u2212 5 for BeH2, and nq = 2M \u2212 4 otherwise."

The\nnumber of such determinants is nc = ( M N\u03b1 )( M N\u03b2 ) . We then select determinants in the same irreducible representation (irrep) of the molecular orbital symmetry group to which the HF state belongs, i.e. the totally symmetric irrep in the Abelian point group relevant to the present work.

Furthermore, they can lead to potential energy curves that are not differentiable with respect to nuclear coordinates, leading to ill-defined forces. Finally, even supplying adequate initial guesses for the parameter optimization may be challenging. These pitfalls are so pronounced that they are exhibited even by closed-shell molecular species at the STO-6G level of theory. Furthermore, their interplay is rather subtle. After illustrating the limitations of hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze for a set of second-quantization problems, we perform a comparative analysis of data, to illustrate the interplay between non-differentiability, symmetry-breaking, and challenging optimization.\nFor the small molecules studied here, the exact solution of the Schro\u0308dinger equation can be accessed using FCI.

The ES Hamiltonian has several symmetries, i.e. operators X\u0302 such that [H\u0302, X\u0302] = 0. In the presence of Hamiltonian\nsymmetries, the search for Hamiltonian eigenfunctions has to be restricted to eigenspaces of X\u0302 with known eigenvalues. Relevant Hamiltonian symmetries are the auxiliary operators Eq. (2) and, for the molecules studied in the present work, the ground-state should lie in the eigenspaces of S\u0302z and S\u0302 2 with eigenvalue zero, and of N\u0302 with eigenvalues 2 for LiH, 4 for BH and BeH2, 6 for H2O and 8 for HF. To assess whether a variational simulation leads to symmetrybreaking, and to quantify its extent, we computed the differences\n\u2206N = NVQE(\u03b8)\u2212NFCI , \u2206Sz = Sz,VQE(\u03b8)\u2212 Sz,FCI , \u2206S2 = S2VQE(\u03b8)\u2212 S2FCI , (22)\nbetween the calculated and exact ground-state particle number, spin-z, and total spin.\n7"

            "text": "The overall strategy for the calculations performed in this work involved initial pre-processing by the classical quantum chemistry code PySCF [49, 50] (as detailed in Section II of the SI) to generate optimized Hartree-Fock orbitals, Hamiltonian coefficients, and FCI energies and properties, before performing computations with quantum simulators. The restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) singlet state was chosen as the initial state for all of the calculations described here, since experience has indicated that this state is a good choice for various chemical problems [34]. Details about the molecular orbitals and the FCI natural orbitals are in Section II of the SI.\nHaving selected a set of single-electron orbitals for each studied species, we performed VQE computations with quantum simulators. We used IBM\u2019s open-source Python library for quantum computing, Qiskit [51]. Qiskit provides tools for various tasks, for example creating quantum circuits and performing quantum simulations. In particular, it contains an implementation of the VQE algorithm.\nFollowing the VQE protocol, we then minimized the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to the parameters of the circuit, \u03b8. To carry out the minimization we employed the classical optimization methods L BFGS B and conjugate gradient [52, 53]. In many cases, to determine the lowest energy along the dissociation path, we performed multiple VQE calculations using different initial parameters. Once the VQE was complete, we obtained the optimized variational form and the estimate for the ground-state energy. In addition, we measured the set of auxiliary operators, see Eq. (2) to investigate the degree of symmetry breaking.\nA. Second-quantization simulations\nIn Figures 3 and 4, we show the ground-state energy and auxiliary properties (as indicators of symmetry-breaking) of the H2O molecule within second-quantization encoding.\nFor the bond lengths and Ansa\u0308tze studied here, energies typically decrease monotonically with number of Ansatz layers nl. As naturally expected, hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze are outperformed by q-UCCSD, since the latter is constructed starting from the natural excitations of the system (i.e. electronic transitions from occupied to virtual orbitals), rather than from application-agnostic circuits.\nInterestingly, the linear-connectivity Ry Ansatz typically outperforms its full-connectivity counterpart, achieving more accurate results with fewer quantum resources. Furthermore, a cascade Ansatz with nl layers performs approximately as well as a linear-connectivity Ry Ansatz with 2nl layers.\nThe most challenging regime is the intermediate dissociation region (R \u2243 2-3 A\u030a), where the energies from hardwareefficient Ansa\u0308tze are more than 100 milliHartree above the FCI value and clearly display cusps. Since calculations were carefully converged, these cusps are likely not a product of unconverged parameters, but rather a genuine limitation of the underlying Ansa\u0308tze, which stands to impact the computation of energy gradients and lead to nonphysical forces.\nIt should be noted that an inaccurate performance by hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze and q-UCCSD is accompanied by a pronounced breaking of the spin symmetry: the total spin of low-depth Ry Ansa\u0308tze evolves from S 2 = 0 at short\n9 R towards a mixture of singlet and triplet at large R. Ansatz inaccuracy and symmetry-breaking, however, are not perfectly correlated. The largest deviations between VQE and FCI energies occur in the intermediate dissociation region, where symmetry-breaking starts to develop due to a larger static correlation; on the other hand, spin symmetrybreaking is most pronounced at dissociation (R \u2265 3A\u030a), where the VQE energy is in better agreement with FCI. In the dissociation limit, multiple excited states with higher spin have the same energy as the singlet. We attribute the combination of pronounced symmetry-breaking and high accuracy of energies in the dissociation limits to the fact that simulations target high-spin states nearly degenerate with the singlet ground state. Note that symmetry-breaking also occurs in q-UCCSD calculations (vide infra).\nThe pitfalls of hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 are especially pronounced for the H2O molecule where two bonds are broken simultaneously. However, they are general features: for example, as listed in Table I and shown in Section V of the SI, they affect other molecules, albeit to different extents. BeH2 exhibits pronounced symmetry-breaking as highlighted by S2, Sz, and Ne (also in this case two bonds are broken). HF and BH are also affected by symmetry-breaking and non-differentiability of potential energy curves. Even LiH, a twoelectron system that has an exact solution from any classical method with single and double excitations (e.g. CCSD), is affected by symmetry-breaking."

            "text": "In Figure 5 we show the optimization of cascade and Ry-linear Ansa\u0308tze for H2O near the equilibrium geometry. Optimizations are carried out using BFGS. In both cases, the nl = 1 calculation is initialized from \u03b8 = 0. Given a set of optimized parameters for nl, the nl + 1 calculation is initialized initialing the extra parameters with zeros. As seen, cascade features a monotonically decreasing energy with nl, whereas Ry optimizations do not. However, the total number of iterations is roughly the same for both Ansa\u0308tze.\nWe note that, as nl increases, optimizations become noise-dominated (see e.g. small gradient of cascade for nl = 4). This behavior makes very challenging to simultaneously converge energy, and properties within 10\u22122, across dissociation."

            "text": "The q-UCCSD calculations reported in Figures 3 and 4 are spin-unrestricted, employ the primitive Trotter approximation to exponentiate the cluster operator, with exponentials of singles before exponentials of doubles. This choice led to a spin-contaminated solution for H2O at large R, see Fig. 4. It is well-known that the Trotterized form of q-UCC is not exact and order-dependent [37, 44]. The details of the algorithmic implementation of a Trotterized q-UCC have an effect on its ability to produce eigenstates of total spin. In Figure 6 we compare the energies and total spins of restricted closed-shell and unrestricted q-UCCSD, approximated with primitive Trotter and second-order Suzuki product formulas and nl = 1 layers, with singles followed by doubles and doubles followed by singles, for the H2O molecule at the STO-6G level. The quantum circuits used to implement the q-UCCSD Ansatz in a Jordan-Wigner representation are illustrated in Section III of the SI.\nAs seen, the unrestricted Ansatz yields lower energies at large R, albeit with a significant spin contamination (a phenomenon analogous to the Coulson-Fischer [54] instability of mean-field theories). The restricted Ansatz, though\n10\nleading to higher energies, features a modest spin contamination entirely caused by the Trotter approximation,\neT\u0302\u2212T\u0302 \u2020 = e \u2211 \u00b5 t\u00b5(O\u0302\u00b5\u2212O\u0302 \u2020 \u00b5) \u2243 [\u220f \u00b5 e t\u00b5(O\u0302\u00b5\u2212O\u0302 \u2020 \u00b5) nl ]nl , e t\u00b5(O\u0302\u00b5\u2212O\u0302 \u2020 \u00b5) nl \u2243 \u220f i e t\u00b5ci\u00b5 nl \u03c3viwi , (23)\nwhere nl is the number of Trotter steps and \u2211\ni ci\u00b5\u03c3viwi is a qubit representation of O\u0302\u00b5 \u2212 O\u0302\u2020\u00b5 (see Section III of the SI for details). Symmetry-breaking phenomena are milder when a second-order Suzuki product formula is used, and deviations with FCI are more modest when doubles are followed by singles. This is not unexpected [42], since the mean-field reference state only couples with doubles due to Brillouin\u2019s theorem.\nIn particular, a proper singlet wavefunction can be obtained without any accuracy loss by using a restricted closed-\n11\nshell implementation of q-UCCSD, Suzuki approximation, doubles before singles and nl = 2 layers. We remark that q-UCCSD does not feature barren plateaus in the parameter optimization; this is a simple manifestation of the fact that symmetry-breaking and difficult parameter optimization are not perfectly correlated."

            "text": "Second-quantization make use of the full Fock space of electrons in m spatial orbitals. As observed in the previous Section, this choice can lead to various symmetry-breaking phenomena, due to qubit wavefunctions having a component outside the target subspace (e.g. Ne = N\u03b1 +N\u03b2 , Sz = (N\u03b1 \u2212N\u03b2)/2, and S2 = Sz(Sz + 1)\u210f).\nA possible strategy to remedy such a pitfall of hardware-efficient data is to rely on a first-quantization encoding, which automatically gives access to eigenfunctions of particle number, spin, and molecular orbital point-group symmetry.\nIn Figure 7a,b we computed ground-state potential energy curves for H2O using the cascade Ansatz and the \u201ctrimming\u201d and \u201cpadding\u201d schemes. In Figure 7c, we use instead the linear-connectivity Ry Ansatz. In this framework, cascade simulations with nl = 3 or greater agree with the exact ground-state energy of the trimmed Hamiltonian within 25 microHartree. However, the trimming itself leads to a deviation between the FCI energy of the trimmed and that of the original first-quantized Hamiltonian, which is up to 0.1 milliHartree. We also remark that all potential energy curves exhibit cusps. The squared-norm P of the physical component of the wavefunction reaches values as small as 2 \u00b7 10\u22121 and 1 \u00b7 10\u22122 for cascade and Ry respectively. Such a phenomenon indicates that, for both Ansa\u0308tze, lowering the energy is accompanied by leakage of the wavefunction outside the physical subspace.\nThe first-quantization data presented in this Section indicate that discontinuities in the potential energy curves can be observed in absence of symmetry-breaking, hence the two phenomena are not perfectly correlated."

            "text": "Agreement with FCI within 1.6 milliHartree (1 kcal/mol) and smoother potential energy curves are only achieved, for second-quantization simulations, by increasing nl to the values listed in Table II. The energies of such Ansa\u0308tze\n12\nare shown in Figure 8. As seen, 1 kcal/mol was reached for all molecules except for BeH2 with Ry Ansatz and full-connectivity, where even nl = 10 leads to energies more than 1.6 milliHartree above FCI. To achieve kcal/mol accuracy, q-UCCSD calculations required nl = 1 layers for BH, HF and nl = 2 layers for BeH2, H2O. This likely arises in the latter cases since two covalent bonds are broken simultaneously, and a second repetition of the q-UCCSD Ansatz includes the effect of disconnected quadruple excitations.\nThe computational cost of the circuits implementing the hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze in Figure 8 is listed in Table II, along with first-quantization simulations in Figure 7 and Section V of the SI. The computational cost is estimated considering: number of qubits nq, number of layers nl, number of gates ng both (1 qubit, 2 qubits), depth d of the variational circuit, number of Pauli operators in the Hamiltonian np, and number of variational parameters n\u03b8. Note that ng is the number of gates in the circuit diagram. Many topologies of quantum architectures restrict interactions to adjacent qubits, which in turn may increase the latency of quantum circuits compiled to these architectures. More practically, a network of SWAP gates has to be introduced in the circuit to allow entangling gates between nonadjacent qubits. The nature of such a SWAP network depends on the device connectivity, the compiler used, and the\n13\ncircuit structure (for example, linear-Ry and cascade benefit from linear qubit connectivity whereas full-Ry benefits from all-to-all connectivity). We have chosen to base the calculation of the computational cost on the circuit, which is agnostic to any assumptions about hardware connectivity.\nAn important observation is that the number of variational parameters is comparable with the dimension 2nq of the nq-qubit Hilbert space. This is an indication that hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze need to be highly expressive (which is achieved by covering a significant portion of the Hilbert space) so that a close approximation of the desired solution can be accessed. On the other hand, the expressivity of these Ansa\u0308tze comes at the cost of flatter cost function landscapes and therefore more difficult parameter optimization [55].\nWe remark that the circuits required to reach 1.6 milliHartree accuracy have depth up to 114 layers of gates, which makes them challenging to implement on contemporary hardware given the high fidelity required by electronic structure.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nWe outline the schema of a repository that stores the results to provide value to other researchers, and which can\n14\nbe extended in future studies to illustrate the properties of other hardware Ansa\u0308tze. The schema is illustrated in Figure 9. The results in this study, organized with respect to this schema, can be publicly accessed on GitHub at [56]. Details of the format of the data within the folders can be found in Section I of the SI."

            "text": "In this work, we discussed some potential pitfalls connected with the use of variational quantum computing Ansa\u0308tze in electronic structure. We considered Ansa\u0308tze routinely used for simulations on contemporary hardware, and studied their behavior using noiseless simulations, i.e. assuming a perfect device not affected by decoherence.\nAlong with the well-known issue of challenging parameter optimization, we observed that hardware-efficient Ansa\u0308tze may break Hamiltonian symmetries and yield potential energy curves that are non-differentiable. A considerable number of layers may also be required to give results within 1 kcal/mol of FCI, thus making these calculations considerably more expensive and thus less suitable for near-term quantum hardware.\nWe observed that these phenomena are not perfectly correlated with each other: the analysis of Trotterized qUCCSD data indicates that symmetry breaking may occur in absence of challenging parameter optimization or nondifferentiable potential energy curves; the analysis of first-quantization data, that challenging parameter optimization and non-differentiable potential energy curves may be observed in absence of spin symmetry breaking.\nWe believe these issues are important, their analysis constitutes an important criterion to design novel and refine existing hardware-efficient quantum computing algorithms, and their mitigation is an important research activity at the interface between ES and quantum computing.\nWhile this study offers a concrete and numerical assessment of computational cost and algorithmic performance, it should only be regarded as the starting point of a broader investigation. Extensions could include investigation of other variational Ansa\u0308tze [31, 57, 58], and algorithms other than VQE [57, 59\u201362]. The study of molecular systems could be expanded to open-shells (e.g. radicals), non-minimal bases (e.g. Pople [63] and/or correlation-consistent [64] bases), and different properties (e.g. dissociation energy curves and spin for excited states). Finally, from a quantum computing perspective, the evaluation of molecular observables (e.g. ground state dissociation energies and spin) could be studied using classical software to emulate decoherence and actual quantum devices to assess the improvements brought by error mitigation techniques.\nThe present study is accompanied by a repository to integrate possible future extensions. We believe the present study will be a useful contribution to the understanding and development of quantum computing algorithms for electronic structure problems.\nSUPPORTING INFORMATION\nContains details of the repository, information about classical preprocessing, implementation of the qUCCSD Ansatz, and additional first- and second-quantization simulations."
