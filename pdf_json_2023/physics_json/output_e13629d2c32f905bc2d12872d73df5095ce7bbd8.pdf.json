If a suitable substituent is introduced into the structure, it will have the dual function of chromism and luminescence, which will broaden its application field. Here, Vio1$2Cl and Vio2$2Br were synthesized by introducing aromatic acetophenone and naphthophenone substituents into the viologen structure. The keto group (\u2013CH2CO\u2013) on the substituents is prone to isomerize into the enol structure (\u2013CH]COH\u2013) in organic solvents, especially in DMSO, resulting in a larger conjugated system to stabilize the molecular structure and enhance fluorescence. The time-dependent fluorescence spectrum shows obvious keto-to-enol isomerization-induced fluorescence enhancement. The quantum yield also increased significantly (T = 1 day, FVio1 = 25.81%, FVio2 = 41.44%; T = 7 days, FVio1 = 31.48%, and FVio2 = 54.40%) in DMSO.

However, the current reports about viologen uorescent materials mostly focus on polymers17 and inorganic hybrid materials,18,19 while examples of a viologen itself with strong uorescence are rarely reported. In addition, the uorescence behavior of viologens in solution has always been a controversial topic in the past and it is frequently reported that a viologen itself has no uorescence in uid solution unless uorescent pyridinone impurities are produced due to oxidation.20\u201322 So far, there has been no in-\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Here, we expect to introduce aromatic uorophores of acetophenone and naphthophenone substituents into the viologen structure, which is conducive to expanding the conjugated system to stabilize the molecular structure and enhance uorescence. Moreover, molecules containing a larger conjugated structure oen exhibit interesting emission enhancement, and emission switching due to isomerization or aggregation.23 This unique isomerization induced uorescence enhancement phenomenon is worthy of further investigation, and can also guide the synthesis of uorescent viologens.\nHerein, we designed and synthesized two new viologen derivatives, named Vio1$2Cl and Vio2$2Br, which were obtained by the reaction of trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (dpe) with chloroacetophenone and bromoacetonaphthone, respectively (Scheme 1). The carbonyl group on the acetophenone and naphthophenone substituent in Vio12+ and Vio22+ is prone to isomerization to an enol structure to form large conjugated systems in organic solvents, which will enhance the uorescence emission. Time-dependent uorescence results showed that Vio12+ and Vio22+ in organic solvents, especially DMSO, showed obvious uorescence enhancement with the increase of time, and the uorescence lifetime and quantum yield (QY) also increased with the increase of enol components (T= 1 day, FVio1= 25.81%, FVio2 = 41.44%; T = 7 days, FVio1 = 31.48%, and FVio2 = 54.40%). Time-dependent\n1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) showed that the enol component of Vio12+ and Vio22+ increased with time in d-DMSO, and no new species with an unknown structure were produced. Time-dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data also showed that no uorescent impurities were produced over time. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the enol form of Vio12+ and Vio22+ enhances the migration of p electrons in the system; the enol structure has a more stable structure, and stronger uorescence emission. As far as we know, Vio1$2Cl and Vio2$2Br are the rst examples of isomerization-induced uorescence enhancement of viologen derivatives, and the unique uorescence behavior and the relationship between the luminescence mechanism and structure are explored in detail here."

            "text": "Sensitive chromic behavior is the most basic characteristic of a viologen, and the solvochromic effect is usually one of its important properties. Vio12+ and Vio22+ are also solvent sensitive, being colorless in H2O, light purple and blue in MeOH, EtOH (ethanol) and DMSO (Fig. 2 and S8\u2020), respectively. The UV-vis (ultraviolet-visible) spectra showed that the maximum absorption wavelengths (lmax) of Vio1\n2+/Vio22+ in MeOH, EtOH, and DMSO are 554/565 nm, 573/582 nm, 595/603 nm (Fig. S9, S10 and Table S2\u2020). Therefore, in the UV-vis spectrum of the same solvent, the maximum absorption wavelength of Vio22+ has a signicant red shi compared with that of Vio12+, which is due to the fact that Vio22+ has a larger conjugate system. It can be seen that the maximum absorption wavelength in different solvents is related to the polarity of the solvent, and shows a blue-shi in higher solvent polarity. The relationship between the maximum absorbance wavelength (l) and polarity (ENT) was obtained by using the empirical formula: l = aENT + b, where a, b are \u221280.2 \u00b1 15.9, 619.5 \u00b1 9.0 for Vio12+; \u2212101.1 \u00b1 9.3, 644.6 \u00b1 5.3 for Vio22+. Vio22+ shows a more sensitive solvatochromic effect because it has a larger negative value a. Previous work has demonstrated that acetophenonesubstituted viologen derivatives are sensitive to bases and solvents. In alkaline solutions or weakly alkaline organic solvents, the keto structure will be partially isomerized to an enol structure, and be reduced to free radicals to show different colors.22 Therefore, there is a conversion equilibrium between divalent cations, free radicals and/or dimers in solution. When the solution is diluted, the equilibrium moves to the direction of keto-to-enol conversion and free radical formation. The absorption peak could change and gradually increase, and the dilution effect is weaker than the conversion effect. When the solution is further diluted, the color of the solution becomes lighter and the intensity of the absorption peak gradually decreases. The conversion and equilibrium rates depend on solvent polarity and its electron donating capacity. For MeOH and EtOH with stronger polarity and weaker electron donating\nFig. 2 Fluorescence emission spectra of Vio1$2Cl (0.2 mmol L\u22121) in H2O state to 42 days). lex = 365 nm (top).

It has been known for a long time that MV2+ is reduced to MVc+ in alkaline aqueous and alcoholic solutions to show color.7 To prove that the color in organic solvents arises from the viologen radicals of Vio1c+ and Vio2c+, EPR tests were performed. Taking Vio12+ as an example, the colorless Vio12+ aqueous solution is EPR silent, while the colored DMSO solution has a weaker EPR signal of s free radical at g = 2.0020, indicating the generation of trace amounts of free radicals Vio1c+ in DMSO. MeOH and EtOH solutions are EPR silent, perhaps due to too few radicals produced in solution, indicating that the electron donating ability of DMSO is stronger than that of MeOH and EtOH. When NaOH was added to the H2O and DMSO solvents, the solutions become darker and produce a strong free radical signal (Fig. S11\u2020), which illustrates that free radicals are chromogenic species in solutions."

As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the initial spectra of Vio12+ show an emission peak at \u223c430 nm, accompanied by a weak shoulder peak which appears at 520\u2013530 nm in H2O and MeOH (Fig. 2a and b). The emission intensities of the\u223c430 nm peak decrease linearly with increasing time in aqueous solution, and they slightly decreased in MeOH solution. The \u223c530 nm peak increases slightly and is still very weak in H2O within 42 days, while in MeOH solution, the emission peak at \u223c520 nm increases rapidly one day aer the solution faded completely, and then slowly increased with increasing time and reached a dynamic equilibrium aer 7 days. For EtOH solution, the \u223c430 nm emission peak also decreases linearly with increasing time, and the difference is that the weak shoulder peak appears at \u223c570 nm in the initial state. 1 day later, the solution faded and the emission peak at\u223c570 nm was blue-shied to\u223c530 nm and rapidly intensied (Fig. 2c). Aer 2 days, the solution reached a kinetic equilibrium and the uorescence intensity remained basically unchanged. It is well known that MV2+ mainly exists in the form of a dimeric aggregate, (MV2+)2 in strong protic solvents, involving a dynamic equilibrium between MV2+ and (MV2+)2.22 Here, H2O is a neutral protic solvent, which cannot promote the conversion of the keto structure to the enol structure of Vio12+, but tends to form dimers. Therefore, the peaks at \u223c430 and \u223c530 nm may be attributed to the emission of divalent cations Vio12+ and dimers (Vio12+)2, respectively. In the protic solvent MeOH, the two emission peaks are similar to those in water, also corresponding to divalent cations and dimers. The crystal structure obtained in MeOH solution also shows that Vio12+ mainly exists in the form of a dimer. Different from that in MeOH, there is a peak at \u223c570 nm in the initial state in EtOH, which can be assigned to the enol structure emission of Vio12+; the solution fades aer 1 day, and the peak blue shis to \u223c530 nm which can also be assigned to the dimer emission. Compared with EtOH, MeOH is a stronger protic solvent, and the aggregation rate of Vio12+ in MeOH may be higher than the conversion rate, so the \u223c570 nm emission peak of the enol form was not found. 1 day later, the rapid enhancement of uorescence was attributed to the fading of the solution, the disappearance of Vio1c+ radicals and the disappearance of their quenching effect on uorescence, which was caused by the oxidation of oxygen in air.\nAs shown in Fig. 2d, different from Vio12+ in protic solvents, Vio12+ has only one obvious emission peak at\u223c577 nm inDMSO, which gradually increases with increasing time, and does not reach a dynamic equilibrium within 42 days. The emission peak at \u223c410 nm is very weak and basically unchanged, and there is no emission peak at \u223c530 nm. Since DMSO has a certain weak basicity and is an aprotic solvent, it is easier to promote the isomerization of the keto to enol form rather than dimerization,38 so the peak at \u223c577 nm can be attributed to the enol emission of Vio12+. The subsequent time-dependent 1H NMR and DFT calculations also support this speculation.\nVio22+ has almost no uorescence in H2O, so it has not been studied. The crystal structure analysis of Vio22+ shows that the formation of dimers is not easy because of the larger steric hindrance effect of naphthophenone substituents.39 Therefore,\n7020 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 7016\u20137025\nthere is no dimer emission peak (\u223c530 nm) in MeOH and EtOH, and only one emission peak at\u223c430 nm in MeOH, coming from the keto structure emission of Vio22+. In EtOH, there are two emissions, at \u223c430 and \u223c571 nm, which can be assigned to the Vio22+ keto structure and enol structure emission, respectively. Similar to Vio12+, there is a strong emission peak of the enol structure at \u223c577 nm in DMSO. The uorescence intensity gradually increases with time in MeOH, EtOH and DMSO solutions. On one hand, the colored radicals were gradually oxidized by oxygen, the solution faded, and the uorescence quenching effect of radicals was gradually weakened. On the other hand, the continuous structure conversion of the keto-toenol form, led to a gradual increase of the enol form composition and enhanced uorescence. However, in EtOH and DMSO solutions, the conversion equilibrium was still not reached within 14 days, and the conversion rate was very slow (Fig. S12\u2020). From the above results, it is obvious that the enol form of Vio12+ and Vio22+ has stronger uorescence.\nFrom the UV-vis and PL spectra, it is found that Vio12+ and Vio22+ have a larger stack shi (Dl = 62\u2013135 nm and DSt > 2572\u20135600 cm\u22121) in DMSO (Table S3\u2020), so the low background interference and high detection sensitivity are benecial to the application of uorescence sensing. It should be mentioned that the uorescence lifetime and QY were also tested in several solvents. The results show that the DMSO solution has the highest uorescence QY and the longest lifetime, and the QY increases with time, T = 1 day, FVio1 = 25.81%, FVio2 = 41.44%; T = 7 days, FVio1 = 31.48%, s = 3.80 ns, FVio2 = 54.40%, and s = 3.68 ns. Indeed, the DMSO solutions of Vio12+ and Vio22+ can maintain strong uorescence for extended periods (>12 month) in air. This demonstrates that Vio12+ and Vio22+ have stable excited states under ambient conditions in DMSO, and low rates of intersystem crossing to the reactive triplet state.40 The uorescence lifetime of Vio12+ and Vio22+ far exceeds that of reported viologen derivatives,41 and it is also the rst viologen derivative found to have uorescence enhancement due to isomerization.\nIn order to verify the effect of light sources (natural light and 365 nm UV light) on the uorescence or isomerization of viologen solution, we also carried out UV illumination experiments on the viologen solution. As we envisioned, UV irradiation can accelerate the conversion of the ketone to the enol form and uorescence enhancement in the viologen solution. As shown in Fig. S13 and S14,\u2020 the uorescence gradually increases with the increase of UV lamp irradiation time and the maximum emission peak at \u223c577 nm remains unchanged in DMSO solution for Vio12+ and Vio22+, indicating that no other new uorescent impurities were produced in the solution under UV light excitation. The difference between the two compounds is that Vio12+ is more sensitive to UV light, while the uorescence intensity of Vio22+ gradually increases with time even if placed in the dark, its conversion rate will be faster under UV lamp irradiation. The changes in uorescence intensity suggest that UV illumination plays an important role in the structural transformation of the keto to he enol form and the uorescence enhancement in DMSO solution.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "According to the UV-vis spectra and time-dependent uorescence changes, we can speculate that Vio12+ mainly undergoes the conversion of the keto-to-enol conguration and intramolecular or intermolecular electron transfer to generate free radicals in organic solutions (Scheme 2). For Vio22+, the dimer is not easily formed due to the large steric hindrance of the naphthophenone substituents, and no emission peak at \u223c530 nm appears. Therefore, the uorescence enhancement of Vio12+ and Vio22+ in solution mainly originates from isomerization rather than the generation of uorescent impurities. The reason is that keto structure is prone to isomerization into enol structure due to the existence of active hydrogen on \u2013CH2CO\u2013 groups,36 which can be easily converted into enol groups (\u2013CH]COH\u2013) by the pseudobase solvent effect, which makes its structure has larger conjugated system and more stable. To further conrm our speculation, time-dependent 1H NMR and ESI-MS were characterized in solution.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the 1H NMR spectrum of d-DMSO solution within 1 h showed the chemical shis of the methylene hydrogens of Vio12+ and Vio22+ were split into two 6.50 \u00f0d01\u00de and 6.60 ppm \u00f0d02\u00de and were assigned to the H peak of the enol form,42,43 which are very weak for Vio12+ and almost invisible for Vio22+, indicating that only trace amounts of the enol conguration were generated within one hour. However,\nScheme 2 The reaction mechanism of Vio12+ and Vio22+ in solvents.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nthe intensity of d01 and d 0 2 gradually increased aer 1 day and 7 days, indicating that the enol form gradually increased with time. The growth rate of d02 is obviously stronger than that of d01, indicating that the conversion rate of Vio22+ is higher than that of Vio12+ at the same time, perhaps because the greater steric hindrance of the substituent of Vio22+ makes the intermolecular interaction weaker, which is conducive to the conversion.\nIt should be mentioned that there are 4 methylene hydrogens in the keto structure, and only 2 alkene hydrogens in the enol structure. Therefore, the change of the content of keto (d/4) and enol (d\u2032/2) in the solution can be measured by the integrated area of d and d\u2032, and the content of the enol and the uorescence intensity at different times are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the enol content of Vio12+ increases from 14.17% to 23.95% from 1 h to 7 days, the uorescence intensity increased 3.8 times, and the corresponding QY increased to 31.84%, while for Vio22+, the enol content increased from 6.11% to 42.86% from 1 h to 7 days, the uorescence intensity increased 6.9 times, and the QY increased to 54.40%. The time-dependent 1H NMR results showed that there was no obvious new species produced, so the uorescence enhancement of DMSO solution with time should be mainly due to the generation of the isomerized enol conguration, and the peak at \u223c577 nm should be assigned to the enol form emission.\nIn order to further verify the luminescence mechanism and determine whether new species are generated, the timedependent ESI-MS of Vio12+ and Vio22+ was also studied. As shown in Fig. 4 and S15,\u2020 them/z of 419 and 210 correspond to the viologen radical (Mc+), and double charge ion peak (M2+/2) of Vio12+ in H2O and MeOH within 1 h, respectively, and a few fragment peaks were found. With increasing time, the peaks of the free radical and fragments gradually weakened on the 7th day. Aer the 14th day, all fragment and the free radical peaks completely disappeared, with only one double charge ion peak of a divalent cation, indicating that only Vio12+ existed in solution.\n, 1 d, and 7 d) in d-DMSO solution.\nChem.

It should be noted here that the double charge ion peak of divalent cations should come from the keto and/or enol form. The ESI-MS spectrum cannot determine the specic molecular conguration, but it can be shown that no new luminescent species are formed in the solution over time. Therefore, this further illustrates that the enhanced uorescence in solution with time shouldmainly come from the conformational transition.\nThe double charge ion peak abundances of divalent cations in different solvents shows different changes with time. For Vio12+, the ionic abundance of M2+/2 decreased signicantly with time in H2O and MeOH, from 1 to 0.791 and 0.928 on the 7th day, and to 0.523 and 0.675 on the 14th day, respectively, while in DMSO, the decrease was not obvious, only from 1 to 0.824 until the 14th day (Fig. 4 and Table S4\u2020). The obvious decrease of ion abundance in H2O and MeOH should be mainly due to the dimerization of divalent cations, while in DMSO, dimerization is not easy, and the slightly decreased ion abundancemay be due to the fact that there are still small amounts of free radicals, benzene and fragments. The double charge ion peak abundances of Vio22+ did not change signicantly aer 14 days inMeOH, EtOH andDMSO, respectively,\nFig. 4 ESI-MS of Vio12+ in different solvents (H2O, MeOH and DMSO) a\n7022 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 7016\u20137025\nindicating that no dimerization occurred because of the large steric effect of the naphthophenone substituents, and the reduced ion abundance was attributed to the presence of fragmentation peaks. This result is consistent with the crystal structure and timedependent uorescence spectroscopic data.\nIn situ FTIR is an effective tool to characterize isomerization of the keto to the enol form. Due to the better volatility of ethanol, FTIR of Vio12+ and Vio22+ was performed on the ethanol solutions. In order to promote the conversion and improve the conversion rate, an appropriate amount of NaOH solution was added to the ethanol solution and it was kept for one day. As shown in Fig. S16,\u2020 the FTIR spectra of Vio12+ and Vio22+ have obvious keto carbonyl groups at \u223c1680 nm\u22121 and \u223c1630 nm\u22121 in the initial state, while the characteristic peaks of the carbonyl group are very weak and almost disappear aer 1 day, and then the strong and wide absorption peak of the enol form appears at 3200\u20133400 nm\u22121 and 1500\u20131300 nm\u22121, which further proves that Vio12+ and Vio22+ are indeed prone to the conversion of the keto to the enol form under alkaline conditions."

            "text": "The starting ground state molecular structures of keto viologens have been constructed according to the X-ray crystallographic results, and also used as starting points to form enolic structures with two congurations: boat and chair. For the latter the optimal orientation of the migrating hydrogen atoms has been extensively tested by a relaxed scan. Such ground state keto and enol forms of Vio12+ and Vio22+ have been further optimized without any constraints (Fig. S17\u2020). The structural diagrams of the ground and excited states of different congurations of Vio12+ and Vio22+ (Fig. S18 and S19\u2020) and their corresponding energies (Tables S5 and S6\u2020) were optimized using the dispersion empirical formula B3LYP.\nAs shown in Fig. S18,\u2020 the Vio12+ and Vio22+ keto forms are nonplanar, in both ground and excited electronic states, while enolic molecules form structures with high coplanar properties. In the case of Vio12+, the non-planar original keto boat and chair forms also show very similar optical properties. When the Vio12+ keto form is converted to the enol form, its energy is changed by \u223c90 kJ mol\u22121, and the dihedral angle is reduced by\nt different times (1 h, 7 d, and 14 d).\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

A similar phenomenon is also observed in Vio22+, whose energy has a larger change of \u223c560 kJ mol\u22121 and the dihedral angle is reduced by about 80\u00b0 (from 83.54\u00b0 to 4.65\u00b0) (Tables S5 and S6\u2020).\nThis suggests that the conversion of the enol form promotes coplanarity throughout the molecular structure, thereby expanding the range of electron transfer in the molecule. It also indicates that the enol form structure is more stable. Furthermore, these changes can be intuitively and clearly explained by analyzing the molecular orbitals and electron densities. Fig. 5 shows the plots of the difference in electron density (ELD) between the ground state and the rst excited electronic state for Vio12+ and Vio22+. It is found that electronic excitation mainly occurs on the pyridine ring for the keto structure, while for enolic structures it is extended over the whole molecule. This leads to a more conjugated structure with an increased number of p-bonds. Therefore, increasing the degree of conjugation of the viologen molecule is benecial to its stability and enhanced uorescence.\nSimilarly, like in the detailed experimental analysis, we have focused on the Vio12+ molecules in DMSO solution due to their continuously enhanced uorescence with time. The solvent model applied in this study is expected to correctly account for the bulk solvent effects due to environment polarizability. The absorption electronic spectra have been obtained from vertical excitation energies and transition moments computed at the TD-DFT level, also allowing the indication of the lowest bright electronic states, for which TD-DFT optimizations have been performed. Fluorescence spectra have been obtained as a vertical emission from TD-DFT optimized structures.\nFig. 6a summarizes the photophysical processes. The uorescence emission peaks of the keto and enol structures of Vio12+ and Vio22+ were at 416\u2013417 nm and 563\u2013582 nm, respectively. As the Vio12+-boat/chair keto form changes to the enol form, a stimulated emission band peaking at \u223c416 nm starts to develop, along with a red shi of the signal (from 416 nm to 563 nm and 417 nm to 564 nm for the chair and boat forms). For Vio22+, the simulated emission peak also shows an\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nobvious red shi from 417 nm to 582 nm from the keto to the enol structure. The corresponding theoretical emission lmax is listed in Table S7,\u2020 the spectra obtained with broadening by Gaussian distribution functions is shown in Fig. 6b. In consequence, the excitation energy is lowered, resulting in a signicant red shi in the uorescence emission wavelength. Moreover, the uorescence relative oscillator strength of Vio12+ and Vio22+ enol structures is signicantly higher than that of keto structures (f value changes from 1.53 to 2.63 for Vio12+ and from 1.62 to 2.81 for Vio22+), which can be directly correlated with stronger uorescence emission for the enol structure (Table S7\u2020). The good match between the calculated spectra of keto forms and observed uorescence wavelengths at 410 nm, as well as between the computed spectra of the enol form and the experimental band at 577 nm, which increases the intensity with time, strongly supports the hypothesis of the spectral changes due to the keto-to-enol transitions. It is worth noting that the keto and enol structures of the boat and chair congurations of Vio12+ in the simulated uorescence spectra have very similar uorescence curves, so the two congurations of Vio12+ have no effect on their uorescence.\nChem.

A colorless piece of lter paper with Vio1$2Cl dispersed can be easily obtained by dropping or soaking it in a Vio1$2Cl aqueous solution. The dry test lter paper can undergo a high-contrast color change immediately upon contact with different alkaline organic solvents because of the generation of free radicals (Fig. S20 and S21\u2020), which can easily and effectively sense and recognize different alkaline reagents. In addition, this test strip is also sensitive to ammonia and temperature (Fig. S21a\u2020). When encountering NH3 gas, it will turn blue immediately, and HCl gas can make it fade back to the initial state (Fig. S21b\u2020). When the temperature reaches 60 \u00b0C, the lter paper strip can change color, and with the increase in temperature, the color deepens, and it fades immediately at room temperature (Fig. S21c\u2020). The test strip has excellent chromism reversibility and circularity for NH3/HCl and temperature. However, aer the test strip fades, it is no longer possible to distinguish the solvent type of the test strips. Here, solvatouorochromism can make up for this shortcoming (Fig. 7)."
