    "abstractText": "The development of efficient and stable catalysts with high mass activity is crucial for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, CeO2-Ir heterojunctions supported on carbon nanotubes (CeO2-Ir/CNTs) are synthesized using a solvothermal method based on the heterostructure strategy. CeO2-Ir/CNTs demonstrate remarkable effectiveness as catalysts for acidic OER, achieving 10.0 mA cm\u22122 at a low overpotential of only 262.9 mV and maintaining stability over 60.0 h. Notably, despite using an Ir dosage 15.3 times lower than that of c-IrO2, CeO2-Ir/CNTs exhibit a very high mass activity (2542.3 A gIr@1.53 V), which is 58.8 times higher than that of c-IrO2. When applied to acidic water electrolyzes, CeO2-Ir/CNTs display a prosperous potential for application as anodic catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis reveals that the chemical environment of Ir nanoparticles (NP) can be effectively modulated through coupling with CeO2. This modulation is believed to be the key factor contributing to the excellent OER catalytic activity and stability observed in CeO2-Ir/CNTs.",

            "text": "A significant amount of renewable energy (such as wind energy, tidal energy, solar energy, etc.) is wasted due to ineffective utilization. Utilizing energy storage and conversion devices to convert renewable energy into other forms of stored energy represents an effective approach for addressing the aforementioned issues [1,2]. A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) offers the capability to convert renewable energy into chemical energy in hydrogen, which possesses sustainable, clean, and efficient characteristics [3,4]. PEMWE comprises two crucial half-reactions: cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). OER involves a four electron\u2013proton transfer process that includes complex intermediates\u2019 conversions and necessitates high kinetic costs [5,6]. Most catalysts reported thus far encounter a common challenge: low catalytic activity and poor stability in acidic OER [7,8]. In view of the comprehensive consideration of catalytic activity and stability, Ir-based materials are widely used as catalysts in acidic OER. However, these catalysts currently face challenges such as scarcity, high cost, insufficient catalytic activity, and poor stability, hence they still have a long way to go before practical application can be achieved [9,10]. Consequently, exploring low cost Ir-based catalysts with high activity and durability has become a challenge at present. It has been reported that metallic Ir catalysts with nanorods [11], nanosheets [12], and other structures exhibit exceptional catalytic activity and stability in acidic OER [13]. Significant efforts have been devoted to minimizing the use dosage of Ir without compromising\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7000. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16217000 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7000 2 of 12\nthe catalytic activity. Downsizing Ir to the nanometer scale can enhance the exposure of active sites, thereby improving catalytic activity [14]. Furthermore, the construction of heterojunctions could induce lattice strain within the active phase and allow for the regulation of charge distribution between the two phases, resulting in a regulation of their catalytic activity [15,16]. Consequently, the electronic structure of Ir can be modulated through the construction of heterojunctions with other phases, indirectly influencing the adsorption and desorption of intermediates [16,17]. Appropriate adsorption/desorption facilitates conversion processes of intermediates, leading to enhanced reaction rates and accelerated kinetics [18,19]. The construction of a heterojunction between Ir and metal oxides is a common strategy for enhancing both catalytic activity and stability in Ir-based catalysts. Lee et al. achieved improved OER performance by combining Ir with MoO3 to construct highly electron-deficient Ir NPs [16]. Xing and colleagues uniformly deposited an ultra-fine (~1.0 nm) layer of Ir metal onto the surface of niobium oxide (Nb2O5\u2212x), which exhibited a high concentration of oxygen vacancies [20]. During OER, dynamic migration of oxygen takes place at the two-phase interface between Ir and Nb2O5\u2212x, effectively preventing excessive oxidation of Ir to high-valent species and subsequent deactivation. Although extensive research has focused on developing heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metal oxides combined with iridium (Ir/MOx), investigations into heterojunctions formed by rare earth metal oxides and iridium remain scarce. Cerium oxide is widely used as a catalyst and cocatalyst for many oxidation reactions due to its excellent redox properties [21\u201324]. For example, Im and colleagues improved the electrocatalytic activity of OER by inducing site-selective crystal disorder through the doping of Ce3+ ions into the MIL-88B(Ni) framework [25]. The aforementioned statements have prompted us to redirect our research focus towards CeO2 in order to investigate the electron transfer between CeO2 and Ir, as well as its impact on both the activity and the stability of OER. Moreover, carbon materials are widely acknowledged as ideal supports for electrocatalysis owing to their remarkable specific surface area and excellent electrical conductivity [26\u201328]. As an exemplary carrier, CNTs offer abundant nucleation sites and conductive pathways for catalytic active materials, thereby significantly enhancing the catalytic activity of catalysts while reducing their required quantity [29,30]. In this study, we propose a strategy for the construction of heterojunctions and carbon combination to enhance catalytic performance while reducing the consumption of Ir. This strategy involves modulating the electronic structure of Ir and improving the electron conduction of the catalyst. To achieve this, we engineer electron-deficient Ir NPs through the construction of heterojunctions with CeO2, complemented by the incorporation of CNTs to facilitate efficient charge conduction and improve the utilization of Ir. As a result, CeO2-Ir/CNTs exhibit impressive durability and catalytic activity, operating continuously at 10.0 mA cm\u22122 for over 60.0 h with only 262.9 mV overpotential. These findings underscore the excellent catalytic performance and long-term robustness of CeO2-Ir/CNTs when employed in acidic water electrolyzers."

The catalyst-loaded glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was prepared by drop-casting the catalyst ink onto the GCE, and utilized as the working electrode after natural drying. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 4.0 mg catalyst in 1.0 mL of isopropanol/water solution (V/V = 7/3) with 10.0 \u00b5L Nafion.

            "text": "The synthetic scheme for CeO2-Ir/CNTs is presented in Figure 1a. Briefly, CeO2-Ir/CNTs were synthesized by maintaining a solution containing CNTs, IrCl3, and CeCl3 at 180.0 \u25e6C for 2.0 h. FESEM was carried out to describe the morphology of CeO2-Ir/CNTs, as depicted in Figure S3a. The surface of each CNT appeared rough and was densely attached with ultra-fine NPs. The morphologies of Ir/CNTs and CeO2/CNTs were similar to that of CeO2-Ir/CNTs (Figure S3b,c), indicating that the addition of CeCl3 or IrCl3 had negligible effects on the samples\u2019 morphologies. The micro-structure of CeO2-Ir/CNTs was further investigated by TEM. As depicted in Figure 1b, CeO2 and Ir NPs were well-dispersed on the surface of CNT. Size distribution analysis revealed their average diameter was approximately 2.15 nm (Figure 1b). HRTEM, in Figure 1c, demonstrated multiple paired nanoparticles (marked with yellow calabash), where each nanoparticle displayed clear lattice fringes, indicating their excellent crystallinities. The FFT images in Figure 1d,e clearly illustrate that the paired nanoparticles showed different lattice fringe spacings, that is, 0.221 and 0.192 nm, corresponding well to the (111) plane of Ir (PDF No. 87-0715) and the (220) plane of CeO2 (PDF No. 89-8436), respectively. These results suggest the successful construction of CeO2-Ir heterojunctions (Figure 1c). Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping demonstrated uniform distribution along the contour of CeO2-Ir/CNTs for C, O, Ir, and Ce elements (Figure 1f). XRD patterns of CeO2-Ir/CNTs and CeO2/CNTs are provided in Figure 2a and Figure S4, respectively. The diffraction peaks of Ir (111), CeO2 (111), and (200) of CNTs were observed for CeO2-Ir/CNTs, fully consistent with HRTEM observations. Meanwhile, only those of CeO2 and CNTs were visible for CeO2/CNTs. The composition of xCeO2-Ir/CNTs was investigated by ICP-OES and the results are summarized in Table S1. It was clearly seen that the Ce/Ir molar ratio of xCeO2-Ir/CNTs samples was almost consistent with the feeding ratio of CeCl3/IrCl3. The additional amount of Ce did not alter the structure of xCeO2-Ir/CNTs. As depicted in Figure S5a, irrespective of the CeO2 content in xCeO2-Ir/CNTs, their XRD diffraction peaks consistently exhibited a combination pattern comprising CeO2, Ir, and CNTs; only the peak of CeO2 (111) grew higher with the increasing CeO2 content. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was further applied to calculate the weight percentage of the components within CeO2-Ir/CNTs. According to Figure 2b, a weight loss of ~88.5 wt.% was obviously observed at 800.0 \u25e6C in air, where the CeO2-Ir/CNTs was transformed into CeO2 and IrO2. Consequently, by integrating the ICP-OES and TGA analysis, it was inferred that the weight percentage of Ir in CeO2-Ir/CNTs was estimated to be 5.6 wt.%. EDS analysis further confirmed a 1:1 molar ratio of Ce/Ir and an Ir content of 5.6 wt.% in CeO2-Ir/CNTs, as shown in Table S2.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7000 5 of 12\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 12\nwt.% was obviously observed at 800.0 \u00b0C in air, where the CeO2-Ir/CNTs was transformed into CeO2 and IrO2.

As illustrated in Figure 2c, the survey XPS spectra confirmed the presence of Ce, Ir, O, and C in the sample of CeO2-Ir/CNTs. The Ir 4f spectra were deconvoluted into the following two sets of peaks: metallic Ir peaks and oxidized Ir peaks. The peaks at 61.5 and 64.5 eV could be assigned to Ir 4f7/2 and Ir 4f5/2 of metallic Ir; the oxidized Ir were at 62.9 and 65.9 eV (Figure 2d) [11,37]. The XPS spectra of Ce 3d of CeO2-Ir/CNTs are shown in Figure 2e. From Figure 2e, the Ce 3d spectrum could be decomposed into four pairs of spin orbitals (V/U, V\u2032/U\u2032, V\u2033/U\u2033, and V\u2034/U\u2034), where V and U represent the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 states, respectively [38]. The peaks corresponding to V/U, V\u2033/U\u2033, and V\u2034/U\u2034 were attributed to Ce4+ 3d orbitals, while the peaks corresponding to V\u2019/U\u2019 were associated with Ce3+ 3d [39]. The ratio of Ce3+/Ce3+ + Ce4+ in CeO2 kept constant (39%) after coupling with Ir (Figure 2e), indicating that the chemical environment of Ce did not undergo significant changes. The O 1s spectra in Figure 2f could be deconvoluted into three peaks: OL (531.0 eV), Vo\u00b7 (532.0 eV), and O-H (533.6 eV), where OL and Vo\u00b7 refer to oxygen in the lattice and oxygen vacancies, respectively. The Vo\u00b7 peak further verified the existence of Vo\u00b7 in the CeO2, in line with the presence of a large amount of Ce3+ species. Closer examinations revealed a strong electron coupling between CeO2 and Ir through the heterointerface in the CeO2Ir/CNTs. Figure 2d shows that the peaks corresponding to Ir 4f in the CeO2-Ir/CNTs appeared at a relatively higher binding energy compared with Ir/CNTs (synthesized in\nFigure 1.

As illustrated in Figure S5b, the catalyst activity was improved, by increasing x from 0 to 1.0. However, further increasing x to 1.5 led to declined activity. These findings suggest that optimal OER activity could be achieved by maintaining the Ce/Ir molar ratio of xCeO2-Ir/CNTs at 1/1. Furthermore, Tafel plots (Figure S5c) and EIS analysis (Figure S5d) revealed that the OER kinetics and charge transfer resistance of xCeO2-Ir/CNTs highly depended on x, and both reached the best at x = 1.0. The electrochemical performance of the synthesized CeO2/CNTs and the purchased c-IrO2 were also studied as comparisons. Specifically, CeO2-Ir/CNTs demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity in the acidic OER test. As depicted in Figure 3a, CeO2-Ir/CNTs demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity with an overpotential of 262.9 mV at 10.0 mA cm\u22122 under the acidic OER conditions (0.5 M H2SO4), surpassing that of Ir/CNTs (285.9 mV), c-IrO2 (304.1 mV), and CeO2/CNTs (with negligible OER current). Furthermore, CeO2-Ir/CNTs even outperformed numerous recently reported Ir-based catalysts (Table S3).

EIS was performed to elucidate the origin of the superior catalytic activity of CeO2-Ir/CNTs. At a potential of 1.32 V, CeO2-Ir/CNTs displayed a significantly reduced charge transfer resistance value of 18.1 \u2126 compared with c-IrO2 (46.5 \u2126) and other catalysts (Figure 3d). CeO2-Ir/CNTs efficiently converted electrical power into chemical power, as evidenced by its remarkable FE of 98.2% (Figure S6). It is important to note that the FE of CeO2-Ir/CNTs was less than 100%, which could be attributed to minor carbon corrosion during the OER [40].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 7000 7 of 12\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 12\nFE of 98.2% (Figure S6).

(a) LSVs (solid\u2212dot line with iR compensation), (b) Tafel slopes, (c) mass activity, (d) EIS Nyquist plots, and (e) chronopotentiometric curves of different catalysts.\nCV tests were conducted at different scan rates (v) in the non-Faradic region to calculate the Cdl of catalysts, as depicted in Figure S7a\u2013e. To exclude the morphological effects caused by CeO2 and to investigate the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalysts, LSVs for xCeO2-Ir/CNTs were normalized by their ECSAs that were determined by using a CV method, as depicted in Figure S7f. Notably, CeO2-Ir/CNTs displayed a relatively larger ECSA (46.0 cm2) compared with Ir/CNTs (42.1 cm2), 0.5CeO2-Ir/CNTs (45.4 cm2), and 1.5CeO2-Ir/CNTs (41.5 cm2). Nevertheless, after the ECSA normalization, CeO2Ir/CNTs still showed a larger current density than others, indicating their superior intrinsic activity (Figure S8). Thus, the CeO2 content had a notable influence on the intrinsic catalytic activity of xCeO2-Ir/CNTs. Considering the XPS analysis presented in Figure 2d,f, it could be inferred that the electron interaction between OL of CeO2 and Ir led to the generation of electron-deficient Ir atoms. DFT calculations in a recently reported paper [41] similarly showed that, when Ir NPs interacted with CeO2 NPs, Ir-O bonds formed at the interfaces, allowing for electron transfer from Ir atoms to the OL of CeO2. The charge density of Ir atoms was adjusted by forming Ir-O bonds between Ir and CeO2 in order to optimize the adsorption/desorption of intermediates and finally improve the catalytic activity of OER. This phenomenon could be recognized as the primary factor responsible for the observed enhancement in the intrinsic catalytic activity of CeO2Ir/CNTs. The durability of OER catalysts is a crucial factor that must be carefully assessed to determine their practicality. To further investigate the stability of CeO2-Ir/CNTs under the acidic OER conditions, we conducted chronopotentiometry at 10.0 mA cm\u22122. Figure 3e illustrates that, even after prolonged testing exceeding more than 60.0 h, CeO2-lr/CNTs exhibited excellent durability in the acidic OER test with no significant degradation of their catalytic activity.

Additionally, XPS characterization was performed on CeO2-Ir/CNTs to investigate if there was compositional decay during the stability test. Figure 4e\u2013g show that the CeO2-Ir/CNTs exhibited the XPS spectra of Ir 4f, Ce 3d, and O1s, with the profiles comparable to those before the OER; however, the weaker Ce 3d profile (Figure 4f) may have been attributed to the dissolution of CeO2. The component analysis revealed a slight decrease in the Ir content of CeO2-Ir/CNTs after stability testing, while the loss of CeO2 was more pronounced (Table S4). Therefore, it can be concluded that excellent structural integrity along with stable component composition contributes significantly to maintaining superior activity during acidic OER.\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 12\nwith exceptional structural robustness (Figure 4a).

Conclusions\nWe successfully demonstrated the synthesis of a series of xCeO2-Ir/CNTs with vary-\ning CeO2 contents using a facile solvothermal method. The catalytic activity of xCeO2-\nIr/CNTs was significantly influenced by the content of CeO2, with higher catalytic activity\nobserved for acidic OER when the molar ratio of CeO2/Ir was 1:1. Due to the strong elec-\ntron coupling in CeO2-Ir heterojunctions, CeO2-Ir/CNTs exhibited outstanding OER cata-\nlytic performance in acidic media, significantly exceeding the benchmark c-IrO2. CNTs\nplayed a crucial role by providing abundant nucleation sites and excellent conductive\npathways for CeO2-Ir, contributing to the observed high catalytic and mass activity in\nCeO2-Ir/CNTs.
