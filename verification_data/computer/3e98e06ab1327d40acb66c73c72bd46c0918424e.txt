"Time loss aversion has the potential of addressing time-based addiction. One study used an approach rooted in time loss aversion where participants were told how their daily social media use aggregated to the level of a week, month of year [21]. This went beyond usual approaches that would show people their average 'screen time' on different apps. Participantsâ€™ intention to use social media in the future significantly decreased and their intention to engage with non-digital, non-addictive behaviours increased. The decrease in intended future social media use dropped by a whole hour on average."

"The goal of this paper was to recognise and define time-based addiction as a problem that is still in its early stages. It is evident from the analysis in this article that behavioural design in video games has increased the addictive potential of video games. Further, other forms of media have borrowed from behavioural design in video games in the form of gamification. This on its own points towards an intuition shared by researchers and practitioners - that video game design if used irresponsibly may be a large source of time-based addiction. The negative outcomes of time-based addictions are negative on both and individual and societal level, thus more research into its causes and prevention are needed."
