    "abstractText": "Like other forms of neuropathology, gliomas appear to spread along neural pathways. Accordingly, our group and others have previously shown that brain network connecFvity is highly predicFve of glioma survival. In this study, we aimed to examine the molecular mechanisms of this relaFonship via imaging transcriptomics. We retrospecFvely obtained presurgical, T1-weighted MRI datasets from 669 adult paFents, newly diagnosed with diffuse glioma. We measured brain connecFvity using gray maVer networks and coregistered these data with a transcriptomic brain atlas to determine the spaFal co-localizaFon between brain connecFvity and expression paVerns for 14 proto-oncogenes and 3 neural network construcFon genes. We found that all 17 genes were significantly co-localized with brain connecFvity (p < 0.03, corrected). The strength of co-localizaFon was highly predicFve of overall survival in a cross-validated Cox ProporFonal Hazards model (mean area under the curve, AUC = 0.68 +/0.01) and significantly (p < 0.001) more so for a random forest survival model (mean AUC = 0.97 +/0.06). Bayesian network analysis demonstrated direct and indirect causal relaFonships among gene-brain co-localizaFons and survival. Gene ontology analysis showed that metabolic processes were overexpressed when spaFal co-localizaFon between brain connecFvity and gene transcripFon was highest (p < 0.001). Drug-gene interacFon analysis idenFfied 84 potenFal candidate therapies based on our findings. Our findings provide novel insights regarding how gene-brain connecFvity interacFons may affect glioma survival. .

In this study, we aimed to examine the molecular mechanisms of this relaFonship via imaging transcriptomics. We retrospecFvely obtained presurgical, T1-weighted MRI datasets from 669 adult paFents, newly diagnosed with diffuse glioma. We measured brain connecFvity using gray maVer networks and coregistered these data with a transcriptomic brain atlas to determine the spaFal co-localizaFon between brain connecFvity and expression paVerns for 14 proto-oncogenes and 3 neural network construcFon genes. We found that all 17 genes were significantly co-localized with brain connecFvity (p < 0.03, corrected). The strength of co-localizaFon was highly predicFve of overall survival in a cross-validated Cox ProporFonal Hazards model (mean area under the curve, AUC = 0.68 +/- 0.01) and significantly (p < 0.001) more so for a random forest survival model (mean AUC = 0.97 +/- 0.06). Bayesian network analysis demonstrated direct and indirect causal relaFonships among gene-brain co-localizaFons and survival. Gene ontology analysis showed that metabolic processes were overexpressed when spaFal co-localizaFon between brain connecFvity and gene transcripFon was highest (p < 0.001).

Our findings provide novel insights regarding how gene-brain connecFvity interacFons may affect glioma survival."

            "text": "Diffuse gliomas are malignant neoplasms of the brain that have been shown to provoke\nwhole-brain network disrupFon regardless of their primary foci (1-3). It is well-known that neuropathology propagates throughout the brain from the iniFal sites of neurodegeneraFon via mechanisms such as transneuronal spread (4) and neuron derived exosomes (5), for example. In other words, pathology uses the same neural pathways and mechanisms that informaFon uses, and the more acFve or connected these pathways are, the more pathology will be transmiVed. In the case of glioma, tumors form and reorganize neural networks and glioma-infiltrated neurons show significant hyperacFvity. The more connected these neurons are, the more efficiently the tumor proliferates to other areas of the brain, and the shorter the paFent\u2019s survival (6, 7).\nAccordingly, previous studies have demonstrated that whole-brain network connecFvity\nis highly predicFve of glioma survival (8, 9). Uniquely, our prior work has shown that brain-wide gray maVer connecFvity accurately predicts glioma genotype and overall survival, performing significantly beVer than demographic, clinical, or tumor radiomic models (10, 11). Gray maVer volumes extracted from T1-weighted brain MRI (T1MRI) demonstrate covariance paVerns that reflect structural and funcFonal connecFvity networks (12, 13). T1MRI is non-invasive, efficient to acquire, provides excellent contrast between gray and white maVer, and tends to be standard of care for glioma paFents. However, T1MRI does not measure molecular mechanisms. Fortunately, advances in the development of transcriptomic brain atlases make it possible to colocalize neuroimaging and gene expression data (14). Known as imaging transcriptomics, this\nemerging field has already provided novel insights regarding the biological pathways underlying brain health and disease (15).\nKrishna et al. (2023) performed RNA sequencing of glioma Fssue with high and low\nfuncFonal connecFvity, sampled during neurosurgery (6). However, very few studies have applied the non-invasive technique of imaging transcriptomics to examine gene expression paVerns in glioma. Mandal et al. (2020) co-localized brain-wide connectomics with spaFal profiles of several proto-oncogenes to reveal novel informaFon regarding regional vulnerability to glioma (16). Otherwise, Germann and colleagues (2022) published a review describing connectomics and imaging transcriptomics and their potenFal applicaFons for neuro-oncology (17). Here we report the first study to invesFgate the relaFonship between brain-wide connecFvity, brain-wide gene expression, and glioma survival."

A total of 669 paFents met these criteria and had an available, usable, pre-surgical, 3 tesla T1MRI. PaFents were treated during the years of 1990\u20132022. De-idenFfied T1MRI, demographic, and other clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center InsFtuFonal Review Board gave ethical approval of this work (protocol# 2021-0236), which included a waiver of informed consent.\nStructural Brain Connec$vity Maps: Gray maVer volumes were segmented from T1MRI\nwith Voxel-Based Morphometry in StaFsFcal Parametric Mapping v12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) in Matlab v2023b (Mathworks, Inc., NaFck, MA). We employed Diffeomorphic Anatomical RegistraFon Through ExponenFated Lie Algebra (DARTEL), which uses a large deformaFon framework to preserve topology and employs customized, sample-specific templates resulFng in superior image registraFon, even in lesioned brains, compared to other automated methods (18). Successful normalizaFon was confirmed using visual and quanFtaFve quality assurance methods.\nA gray maVer covariance map was constructed for each parFcipant using a similarity-\nbased extracFon method (19). Specifically, network nodes were defined as 3x3x3mm cubes spanning the enFre gray maVer volume (i.e., 54 gray maVer values per cube, 7134 +/- 382 cubes). A correlaFon matrix was calculated across all pairs of nodes. We then applied graph theoreFcal analysis using the bNets Toolbox v2.2 (Brain Health Neuroscience Lab, AusFn, TX) (20) and Brain ConnecFvity Toolbox v2019-03-03 (21) to calculate local efficiency (22) for each node. Nodal efficiency is consistently observed to be affected in paFents with diffuse glioma (2, 23-25) and we have shown that it predicts overall survival and IDH tumor status with crossvalidated areas under the curve of 0.88 and 0.94, respecFvely (10, 11). A staFsFcal image corresponding to the nodal efficiency of each cube was created using the standard space Montreal Neurological InsFtute (MNI) coordinates of each cube.\nGene Expression Profiles: We obtained brain transcriptome data from the Allen Human\nBrain Atlas (AHBA), which is currently considered the most comprehensive transcripFonal brain map available (15). AHBA was developed using six adult human donor brains to provide\nexpression data from tens of thousands of genes measured from thousands of brain regions (26). The standard space T1MRI\u2019s of the donor brains are also publicly available to facilitate their spaFal coregistraFon with neuroimaging data from study samples. Mandal and colleagues showed that several proto-oncogenes important for gliomagenesis, as idenFfied in a review by Molinaro et al. (27), were spaFally correlated with glioma distribuFon (16). Krishna and colleagues showed that expression of certain genes involved in the development of neural networks were upregulated in highly connected, tumor-infiltrated brain regions (6). We therefore extracted expression profiles for these same genes, excluding those for which there were no valid AHBA probes available (Supplementary Table 1).\nImaging Transcriptomics: To determine the co-localizaFon of brain imaging and\ntranscripFon data, we used the MulFmodal Environment for Neuroimaging and Genomic Analysis (MENGA) toolbox v3.1 in Matlab v2023b to spaFally correlate the structural brain connecFvity map of each parFcipant with paVerns of AHBA expression from the 17 selected genes. The details of this analysis were described by Rizzo et al. (2016) (28). Briefly, the imaging data for each glioma parFcipant was resampled into AHBA coordinates with a 3mm resoluFon. The expression data for each AHBA donor, for each gene was sampled from each of 169 AHBA regions resulFng in a 169x6 region-by-gene expression matrix for each gene. Principal Components Analysis was performed on the region-by-gene expression matrix to idenFfy components explaining at least 95% variance across the AHBA donors. The component scores were then entered as independent variables into a weighted, mulFple linear regression analysis with the corresponding local efficiency values from the glioma parFcipant as the dependent variable. The regression weights were the mean number of samples in each\nconnecFvity map region and the variability of these connecFvity values. P values for the regression models were corrected for mulFple comparisons using false discovery rate (29).\nAssocia$on of Imaging Transcriptomics with Survival: The regression R squared staFsFcs\nfor each gene for each parFcipant (669x17 matrix) were then entered into 1) Cox ProporFonal Hazards (PH), and 2) random forest survival (30) regression models to predict overall survival in months. The absolute value of the R squared staFsFcs were uFlized as predictors to determine if the strength of the image-transcriptome spaFal co-localizaFon was significantly associated with survival. Compared to inferenFal models like Cox PH, random forest models tend to demonstrate significantly beVer performance, are more robust to mulFcollinearity, and can capture complex non-linear relaFonships and interacFons between features. However, they have lower interpretability as the importance of individual predictors is more difficult to ascertain. There is also increased risk of overfipng the model to the data.\nWe implemented 10-folds cross-validaFon (31) for both models to reduce overfipng and\nincrease external validity. Specifically, the N=669 cases were randomly shuffled and then split into 10 subsets (i.e., folds). For each of the 10 cross-validaFon loops, a Cox PH/random forest model was trained on the data from 9 of the folds and then tested on the ler-out fold such that every fold was tested once. The Fme-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operaFng characterisFc was used to determine model performance. This is the integral of AUC on the range of survival Fme from 0 to maximum, weighted by the esFmated probability density of the Fme-to-event outcome. This AUC calculaFon accounts for censoring and the Fme-dependent nature of the parameters (32). The AUC was averaged across the 10 crossvalidaFon loops for each model and the means were compared using a t-test. For the cross-\nvalidaFon models with the highest AUC, we examined the coefficients and p values (Cox PH) and the variable holdout error (random forest survival) (33) to interpret the importance of individual genes in the models.\nPath Analysis: We conducted exploratory Bayesian network analysis to examine the\ncausal relaFonship among the genes whose spaFal co-localizaFon with gray maVer connecFvity showed significant associaFon with survival across both predicFve models. Unlike Structural EquaFon Modeling, this method learns the condiFonal dependencies between variables without any prior assumpFons. We uFlized a hill-climbing approach by opFmizing the Bayesian informaFon criterion to idenFfy the best fit network. The condiFonal independence/dependence relaFonships among variables were encoded with a directed acyclic graph. We employed the method described by Stajduhar and Dalbelo-Basic (34) to account for censored data.\nReliability of Genomic Data: Most of the genes included in AHBA have mulFple probes\nwith some showing more reliable expression paVerns than others. First, the current accuracy of the probe to gene mapping was verified and probe data were normalized to z-scores. RepresentaFve probes were then selected in a data-driven manner considering between-donor homogeneity and the distribuFons of probe data. Genomic autocorrelaFons were calculated to measure the gene expression variability between donors. Most of the Fssue samples used to develop AHBA were obtained only from the ler hemisphere and therefore, we employed a binary mask to limit our analysis to the ler hemisphere (28).\nGene Enrichment: We performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis using the 17\nselected genes ranked by the R squared staFsFc from the co-localizaFon analysis. We uFlized\nthe Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis and VisualizaFon (GOrilla) online tool, which idenFfies hierarchical gene ontology terms by opFmizing the hypergeometric tail probability across subsets of genes based on ranking (35, 36).\nDrug-Gene Interac$ons: We uFlized the web-based Drug-Gene InteracFon Database\n(DGIdb) v5.0 (37) to explore the potenFal druggability of genes whose spaFal co-localizaFon with gray maVer connecFvity showed significant associaFon with survival across both predicFve models. DGIdg idenFfies drug-gene interacFons based on publicaFons and other open sources and calculates a Query Score for ranking search results. The Query Score considers the specificity of the gene-drug associaFon, the overlapping drug interacFons among all genes in the query, and the number of sources supporFng the interacFon. DGIdb results also describe the indicaFon for drugs, when known, as well as the current regulatory status."

Those paFents with available tumor genotyping data were relaFvely split between IDH mutant and wild type (N = 91 missing) as well as MGMT methylated and unmethylated (N = 450 missing). Most paFents (98%) had a Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of 70 or higher, although these data were missing for over half the cohort (Table 1). Median overall survival was 81 months (95% CI: 70 to 96, Figure 1a) with a 36.5% mortality rate over the follow up period of 335 months (median = 45 months).\nImaging Transcriptomics: As shown in Table 2, all 17 selected genes demonstrated\nsignificant spaFal co-localizaFon with whole brain gray maVer connecFvity, even arer correcFon for mulFple comparisons (p < 0.03, corrected).\nImaging Transcriptome and Survival: The mean cross-validated, Fme dependent AUCs\nwere 0.68 +/- 0.01 for Cox PH and 0.97 +/- 0.06 for random forest (Figure 1b). Random forest significantly outperformed Cox PH (p < 0.001, corrected).

In the best random forest model (AUC = 0.999), the most important predictors were the strengths of co-localizaFon of brain connecFvity with TERT, ATRX, FUBP1, and SYNPO (Table 4). Figure 2 shows the causal, Bayesian network pathways among spaFal co-localizaFon and survival.\nGene Enrichment: Ontology analysis indicated several processes that are overexpressed\nwhen spaFal co-localizaFon between gray maVer connecFvity and gene transcripFon is highest.

The database idenFfied 84 different drugs with a mean query score of 1.7 +/- 2.6 (range = 0.02 to 22.1). The highest Query Score was for BronFctuzumab (OMP-52M51). However, there were no interacFons found in the database for FUBP1 or SYNPO (Figure 3b, Supplementary Table 2)."

            "text": "We conducted the first imaging transcriptomics study evaluaFng the relaFonship\nbetween widespread brain connecFvity, brain gene expression, and glioma survival. We found that the expression paVerns of important proto-oncogenes as well as neural network construcFon genes were significantly spaFally correlated with whole brain, gray maVer connecFvity. AddiFonally, we showed that the strength of this co-localizaFon was highly predicFve of overall survival. Our findings make a novel contribuFon to results from prior studies (6, 16) by combining both proto-oncogenes and neural network construcFon genes and by examining large scale brain connecFvity rather than tumor specific connecFvity.\nWe evaluated brain connecFvity using a metric known as nodal efficiency, which\nindicates how many direct connecFons a brain region has with other regions. InformaFon processing is more efficient when there are direct connecFons among neural communiFes. Given previous findings that highly connected, tumor-infiltrated neurons tend to increase proliferaFon of glioma pathology (6), we expected higher nodal efficiency to be associated with lower survival. However, this was dependent on the gene-brain pathway. Higher expression of ATRX, CDKN2A, FUBP1, and SYNPO as well as lower expression of TERT and NOTCH1 were associated with higher nodal efficiency. The strength of these relaFonships was significantly associated with survival. This is consistent with our prior findings that overall survival in paFents with glioma is associated with areas of lower as well as areas of higher gray maVer connecFvity (10).\nIt is important to remember that these relaFonships are not directly between gene\nexpression and survival, but instead reflect the effects of spaFal co-localizaFon of gene\nexpression and brain connecFvity on survival. The causal, Bayesian network path analysis provides further insight regarding these complex relaFonships. NOTCH1- and FUBP1-related brain connecFvity showed the only direct influences on survival. TERT-related brain connecFvity showed an indirect effect on survival by exerFng influence on CDKN2A-related brain connecFvity, which in turn influenced NOTCH1-related brain connecFvity. FUBP1-related brain connecFvity also appeared to influence the relaFonship of brain connecFvity with CDKN2A and NOTCH1 as well as having a direct effect on survival status. ATRX-related brain connecFvity showed an indirect effect on survival via the relaFonship between NOTCH1 and brain connecFvity.\nInterpreFng the impact of higher versus lower brain connecFvity on survival is\nchallenging. These relaFonships were evaluated in mulFvariate space and the significantly beVer performance of the random forest model compared to the Cox PH model indicates that these relaFonships were highly nonlinear. These findings are consistent with evidence that the brain network operates as a system at criFcality, funcFoning opFmally when finely balanced on the edge of various compeFng demands (38). In other words, there is an opFmal range of brain connecFvity where too liVle or too much can be detrimental. Gene-interacFon networks also operate at criFcality (39). At the edge of criFcality, these systems are highly sensiFve to perturbaFons. This sensiFvity can be beneficial, as it allows the network to flexibly respond to changing environments or condiFons. However, it can also make the system vulnerable to mutaFons or detrimental stressors. The interacFons within criFcal systems can lead to emergent behaviors that are not predictable by studying individual components (genes, brain regions) in isolaFon.\nThe opFmal level of brain connecFvity allows for the efficient exchange of informaFon\nwithout overwhelming the system\u2019s resources (22) and thus connecFvity is inherently Fed to metabolism (40). Our gene ontology analysis indicated that metabolism was the common funcFon across the genes that were most important in our predicFve models. This is consistent with previous research on cancer metabolism (41). Our Bayesian network path analysis showed that SYNPO-related brain connecFvity was directed by the relaFonships between brain connecFvity and all other genes in the model. The direct or indirect effects of SYNPO-related brain connecFvity on glioma survival was not apparent from our findings. SYNPO expression is believed to be involved in neural network construcFon (6) and thus would rely heavily on upstream, metabolically driven pathways. However, the effects of SYNPO-related brain connecFvity on survival in the context of proto-oncogenes requires further invesFgaFon.\nGiven that neural connecFvity is associated with neural acFvity, it would be interesFng\nto see if these properFes could be safely reduced to slow tumor progression using drugs that impact the gene-brain connecFvity relaFonships idenFfied by our models. NOTCH1- and FUBP1-related connecFvity showed the only direct causal links to survival and are therefore strong candidate targets. Our drug-gene interacFon analysis idenFfied BronFctuzumab (OMP52M51) as the best candidate. BronFctuzumab is a human monoclonal anFbody that blocks NOTCH1 signaling and has already been proposed as a potenFal treatment for glioma and other cancers (42). Our analysis did not idenFfy any drug-gene interacFons specific to FUBP1, however, this analysis suggests drugs in the context of all queried genes. We noted that the Query Score doubled from 10.91 when NOTCH1 was entered alone to 22.11 when including all 6 significant genes. This suggests BronFctuzumab has overlapping interacFons with the other\ngenes in the query, including FUBP1. Our Bayesian network analysis suggested that enhancing the relaFonship between NOTCH1 and brain connecFvity has survival benefit. Given the nonlinear nature of these relaFonships, it is possible that inhibiFng NOTCH1 could enhance this relaFonship within a certain window of parameters. However, further research is required especially given that this analysis required query of the genes themselves. Thus, the results may not reflect candidate drugs that would directly impact the gene-brain connecFvity rela$onship.\nNonpharmacologic alternaFves for reducing neural acFvity include mindfulness\nmeditaFon and neuromodulaFon. Mindfulness meditaFon focuses on decreasing intrusive thought processes and has been shown to reduce neural acFvity, especially in the default mode network (43), which is the most metabolically acFve funcFonal brain network (40). MeditaFon has addiFonal benefits such as reducing distress, inflammaFon, and blood pressure, and improving cogniFve funcFon (44). However, mindfulness meditaFon can also increase neural acFvity and connecFvity in some individuals, especially among novices (43). NeuromodulaFon involves regulaFng brain acFvity via neurosFmulaFon or neurofeedback. We previously showed that healthy adults can be trained to significantly down-regulate neural acFvity and improve cogniFve funcFon in only 1.5 total hours of neurofeedback across 2 weeks (45). In addiFon to regulaFng neural acFvity, cogniFve funcFon is itself an important predictor of survival in glioma (46). However, given the complex, nonlinear nature of our findings, it will be criFcal to determine which specific neural communiFes require up regulaFon and which require down regulaFon.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that the expression paVerns of several proto-oncogenes\nas well as neural network construcFon genes are significantly co-localized with brain\nconnecFvity. However, higher brain connecFvity may not always be associated with lower survival. We also showed that some gene-brain relaFonships have a direct effect on survival, but most others tend to influence mortality by affecFng other gene-brain relaFonships. The limitaFons of our study include the retrospecFve nature of the data. We selected genes and measured local efficiency based on prior literature, but other genes, connecFvity metrics or connecFvity methods may have produced different results. As noted above, the AHBA provides limited data for the right hemisphere and contralateral differences in gene-brain relaFonships cannot be ruled out. There was heterogeneity in gene expression across the AHBA donors as reflected in the genomic autocorrelaFons, and this may have reduced the power to detect certain effects. Bayesian network coefficients are analogous to those derived from mulFple regression and therefore do not adequately reflect the nonlinear relaFonships among variables. Despite these limitaFons, our findings provide novel insights regarding how gene-brain connecFvity interacFons may affect therapeuFc vulnerabiliFes and glioma survival.\nAcknowledgements: This research was supported by the NaFonal InsFtutes of Health (1R03CA241862).
