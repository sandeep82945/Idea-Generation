Recent investigations have shown a promising solvating extractant, tetraoctyl diglycolamide (TODGA), for intra-Ln separations, which is shown in Fig. 1.5\u20139 At the industrial scale, solvating extractants are preferred because they can be used under high acid concentrations. This eliminates the need to dilute acid and reduces the volume of aqueous waste.1,7 TODGA is advantageous for hydrometallurgical processing because TODGA extracts Lns under highly acidic conditions and follows the CHON (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen) principle.7,8\nl of Mines, Golden, CO, USA.

See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nIn the literature, the combination of solvent extraction, extended X-ray absorption ne structure (EXAFS), UV-vis, and FT-IR spectroscopy has led to an understanding of the LnTODGA structure in the organic phase.10\u201314 TODGA coordinates to Lns in a trischelate complex, [Ln(TODGA)3]\n3+, with outer-sphere nitrate anions (NO3\n\u2212) positioned in the cles of the octyl arms.13,15,16 These nitrates interact with co-extracted H2O molecules forming an extended hydrogen bonding network.10,11 Once this network extends beyond the cles, NO3 \u2212 and H2O molecules interact with (TODGA)$(HNO3)1\u20132 adducts \u2013 increasing the number of molecules associated with each Ln or aggregate. The size of these aggregates rapidly increases with higher HNO3 and Ln concentrations.10 In various solvent extraction systems, a threshold commonly referred to as the limiting organic concentration (LOC) describes the highest concentration of either Ln or HNO3 in the organic phase before the organic phase splits forming a third phase.17\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 6017\u20136026 | 6017"

This results from extracting a large volume of H2O and HNO3 molecules, where the aggregates that form are no longer soluble in the organic diluent. It is important to prevent TPF as TPF is deleterious to the extraction process since industrial mixer-settlers are designed for biphasic extraction. Mitigation of TPF involves adding a phase modier (PM), which is slightly more polar than the diluent, to the organic phase which solubilizes the aggregates.20 The aggregates are solubilized by PMs where the polar moiety of the PM interacts with the extracted H2O, HNO3, and Lns and displaces extractant molecules. As the concentration of PMs is large relative to the extractant concentration, adding PMs increases the complexity of the organic phase through changing both molecular and supramolecular interactions.21\u201323 Several investigations to date have used 1-alcohols as PMs14,20,24 with a particular emphasis on solvent extraction results paired with spectroscopy to probe the extracted Ln diglycolamide (DGA) complex. Systems containing 1-alcohol PMs have larger distribution ratios and the number of DGA molecules associated with the extracted Ln-DGA complex decreases in comparison to systems without PMs. As a result, the role of 1-alcohols in these systems has been attributed to solvation of the Ln-DGA complex through interactions with the outer-sphere hydrogen bonding network.3,25\nIn the current literature only select Lns are chosen for additional characterizationmethods. Techniques in addition to solvent extraction should be used across the entire 4f period aiming to highlight a relationship between organic phase bulk properties and the distribution ratios.26 This work performs a larger-scale investigation which combines the results obtained from solvent extraction, bulk organic phase characteristics, and spectroscopic techniques. In this article, the collection of distribution ratios, co-extraction of H2O, co-extraction of H\n+, and FT-IR spectra are compared to provide additional insight into these systems."

As evident in Table 1 there are several gaps when comparing the concentration of 1-alcohol selected. 1-Octanol has been the most studied PM in literature, so a wide range of concentrations were selected (5, 10, 15, and 30 vol%) to further investigate the relationship between various 1-octanol concentrations. The concentrations of 10 and 15 vol% 1-alcohol were not selected for 1-hexanol, 1-decanol, and 1-dodecanol because the aim of this work was to determine the trend between varying 1-alcohol alkyl chain length at low and high concentrations. The low concentration of 5 vol% 1-alcohol was selected because 5 vol% is commonly used in literature to understand the fundamental chemistry in DGA systems. A high concentration of 30 vol% 1- alcohol was chosen as it is relevant to industrial applications. However, at 30 vol% 1-dodecanol a white precipitate formed at the interface during pre-equilibration. As 1-dodecanol has a melting point of 26 \u00b0C and the experiments were performed at room temperature (21 \u00b0C), this caused 1-dodecanol to form a precipitate. Since a precipitate formed, this prevented data collection for the 30 vol% 1-dodecanol system, and comparison between various 1-alcohol alkyl chain lengths with 1-dodecanol systems. The selected organic phases were pre-equilibrated with 1 M HNO3 for 5 min at 2000 rpm and centrifuged for 5 min at 2800 rpm. A 0.85 mL aliquot of the pre-equilibrated organic phase was contacted with 0.85 mL of 3 mM Ln(NO3)3 in 1 M HNO3 for 5 min at 2000 rpm and centrifuged for 5 min at 2800 rpm. Each Ln was individually contacted in triplicate for error analysis to evaluate trends in co-extracted solutes (Ln3+, H+, and H2O) and FT-IR data across the period. Following extraction, the organic phase was removed for analysis with Karl Fischer (KF), FT-IR, and potentiometric titration."

In the absence of PMs, DLn trend is consistent with the results reported by Sasaki et al.,8 where the D increases from La\u2013Dy with a plateau forming around Ho. With the addition of 1-octanol to the organic phase, the distribution trend is preserved but with an increase in D for each Ln measured. Increasing the 1-octanol concentration from 5 vol% to 30 vol% results in similar Ds across the Lns. At 30 vol% 1-alcohol, changing the length of the 1-alcohol alkyl chain results in a different trend across the Lns. For 1-hexanol (Fig. 2A), there is a decrease in D between Eu and Gd, whereas an increase in the D is observed across the remainder of the Lns. In the case of 1-decanol (Fig. 2C), there is a decrease in the D from Gd to Tb, with an increase in the D from Tb\u2013Tm, with a plateau forming around Yb. The effect of 1-alcohols on DLn is most pronounced in the case of 30 vol% 1-decanol, where Ds for Tb\u2013Lu are lower than the Ds for no modier.\nUnderstanding which systems are better suited for practical applications requires the comparison of SF between systems. The two SFs of interest are Dy/Nd for applications to permanent magnets and Tb/Gd as Gd and Tb are the Lns where the D trend changes in 1-hexanol and 1-decanol systems. The Dy/Nd SFs are shown in Table 2, where a trend emerges between the various 1- alcohols, 1-octanol > 1-hexanol > 1-decanol. As the concentration of 1-octanol increases, the Dy/Nd SF also increases, whereas increasing the concentration of both 1-hexanol and 1- decanol decreases their respective Dy/Nd SFs.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 6017\u20136026 | 6019\nFig. 2 Ds across the Ln period for organic phases containing (A) 0 vol%, 5 vol%, or 30 vol% 1-hexanol, (B) 0 vol%, 5 vol%, 10 vol%, 15 vol%, or 30 vol% 1-octanol, (C) 0 vol%, 5 vol%, or 30 vol% 1-decanol, and (D) 0 vol% or 5 vol% 1-dodecanol.

This is a result of the difference in Ln Z, where Dy/Nd and Tb/Gd have differences of 6 and 1, respectively. For adjacent Lns, the corresponding SFs are typically lower with a value around 2. Increasing the concentration from 5 vol% to 30 vol% of 1-decanol decreases the Tb/Gd SF, however for both 1-hexanol and 1-octanol their Tb/Gd SFs increase. This results in two separate trends in Tb/Gd SFs for the different 1-alcohol concentrations. For 5 vol% 1-alcohol, the trend in SFs is, 1-decanol > 1-hexanol > 1-octanol, whereas the trend for 30 vol% 1-alcohol is, 1-hexanol > 1-octanol > 1-decanol. This suggests that changes in the trend are a factor of changes in 1-decanol behavior.\nAdditional characterizations of the organic phase were used to understand bulk phase properties, specically extraction of H2O and H +. The extraction of H2O was measured via KF and\nreported in Fig. S2.\u2020 In each system, increasing the concentration of 1-alcohol increases H2O extraction, which is also seen following pre-equilibration. This suggests the increase in extraction of H2O molecules arises from the volume composition of 1-alcohol. An increase in H2O extraction is observed following Ln contact, with the largest change existing in the 30 vol% PM systems. It was found that at 30 vol%, adding Lns to the system increases H2O extraction from pre-equilibration contact by 0.05 M, except for 1-decanol which remains similar to pre-equilibration contact. This work suggests in 1-hexanol and 1-octanol systems Lns aid in H2O extraction. However, due to the large concentrations of extracted H2O molecules in comparison to the relatively small Ln concentrations, any trend that may exist across the Ln series is difficult to determine.\nThe different chain lengths of 1-alcohol have varying densities and molecular weights, so the number of 1-alcohols per H2O extracted was calculated to compare the systems to their corresponding PM concentrations. A decrease in 1-alcohol molecules per H2O molecule is associated with an increase in extracted H2O. These results are shown in Table 3. At 5 vol% 1- alcohol, the trend in number of 1-alcohol molecules per H2O molecule is, 1-decanol < 1-octanol < 1-hexanol. Increasing the concentration of 1-alcohol to 30 vol% has the opposite trend, 1- hexanol < 1-octanol < 1-decanol. It appears there is competition between how well 1-alcohol solubilizes the extracted complex versus how much 1-alcohol promotes TPF through extracting more H2O molecules.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Increasing the concentration to 30 vol%, results in a lower 1-hexanol to H2O ratio from increasing the organic phase H2O concentration. This suggests at 5 vol% PM shorter alkyl chains suppress aggregation better, however at 30 vol% PM longer alkyl chains suppress aggregation better. This work supports current literature which determined the relationship between 1-alcohol alkyl chain lengths and aggregate sizes via dynamic light scattering measurements. Swami et al. showed that in tetra(2-ethylhexyl) diglycolamide (T2EHDGA) systems, the addition of 1 M 1-alcohols form smaller particles as the length of the 1-alcohol alkyl chain increases.24 Therefore, in DGA systems with 1-alcohol PMs, this work and previous literature provide insight to a relationship between 1-alcohol alkyl chain length, H2O extraction, and the ability to suppress aggregation. Additional understanding of the relationship between H2O extraction and aggregate size to elucidate the inverse trend for 5 vol% and 30 vol% PM is essential, requiring beamline techniques such as SAXS or SANS, providing a route for future investigations.\nFurther organic phase characterization utilized potentiometric titrations to determine the concentration of H+ in the organic phase. In general, there is a decrease in H+ extracted across the Ln period, as evident in Fig. S3.\u2020Heavier Lns have an associated H+ concentration that approaches the H+ concentration aer pre-equilibration. Additionally, there is not a consistent trend with H+ concentration across volume fractions for a specic 1-alcohol at constant TODGA and HNO3 concentrations. At 5 vol% 1-alcohol the trend is, 1-hexanol \u2013 1- octanol > 1-decanol. The trend in H+ concentrations among the various alkyl lengths of 1-alcohol is opposite for the trend in H2O extraction. Therefore, with a lower concentration (5 vol%) of 1-alcohol a decrease in extraction of H2O corresponds to an increase in extraction of H+. Increasing the concentration to 30 vol% creates a different trend, 1-octanol > 1-decanol \u2013 1- hexanol. At higher volume fractions of 1-alcohol, the extraction of H+ is related to extraction of Ln. More specically, an increase in extraction of H+ increases extraction of Ln, particularly for the heavier Lns. This is reected in the Dy/Nd separation factors, where 1-octanol has larger separation factors than both 1-hexanol and 1-decanol.\nRelation between TODGA, H2O, and H +\nTo understand the relationship between molecules in the outer sphere involved in hydrogen bonding networks, the relationship between TODGA, H2O, and H\n+ was investigated. The ratio of unbound TODGA (TODGA not directly coordinating to Ln) to extracted H2O and H + was calculated by eqn (4) and (5),\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

These relationships provide information as to the number of TODGA molecules available to interact with either H2O or H\n+ molecules, to understand hydrogen bonding networks.\nTODGA\nH2O \u00bc\n\u00bdTODGA i 3$\u00bdLn org\n\u00bdH2O org\n(4)\nTODGA\nH\u00fe \u00bc\n\u00bdTODGA i 3$\u00bdLn org\n\u00bdH\u00fe org\n(5)\nSimilarly, the number of H2O molecules per H + cation was\ncalculated through eqn (6).\nH2O H\u00fe \u00bc \u00bdH2O org\u00bdH\u00fe org\n(6)\nThe number of extracted H2O molecules per acid is reported in Fig. S1.\u2020 There is an increase in the number of H2O molecules per H+ cation across the Ln period according to 1-hexanol > 1-octanol > 1-decanol. Larger volume fractions of 1-alcohol also have greater H2O per H\n+. These trends were then compared to those obtained by Baldwin et al., who reported that the trend in extracted H2O per NO3\n\u2212 closely mirrors the trend in D across the Ln period.15 It is important to note this was observed in a system with 0.001 M HNO3 and 0.5 M NaNO3. In comparison to the work by Baldwin et al., increasing the concentration of HNO3 results in different trends in extracted H2O per H\n+. These differences arise from the increase of H+ which has previously been reported to initiate hydrogen bonding networks crucial for extraction of Ln by TODGA.28,29\nUnderstanding the relationship between unbound TODGA and extracted solutes gives insight into interactions in the hydrogen bonding network. The number of unbound TODGA molecules per extracted H2O molecule was calculated with eqn (4) and are displayed in Fig. 3. At each volume fraction of PM, the trend is 1-hexanol < 1-octanol < 1-decanol. Additionally, the number of unbound TODGA per H2O molecule decreases with increasing volume fraction of PM and decreases across the Ln period. As this parameter of unbound TODGA per solute reects changes only in the outer-sphere, for a larger volume fraction of 1-alcohol, less TODGA molecules are involved in solubilizing the complex. In the current literature, it has been hypothesized the role of 1-alcohol PMs is solely to solubilize the aggregates.20,25 The results discussed from Fig. 3 support this hypothesis, where increasing the 1-alcohol concentration reduces the solubilization of H2O molecules by outer-sphere TODGA. This suggests an increase in 1-alcohol interactions with H2O molecules as the 1-alcohol concentration increases, resulting in better aggregate solubilization.\nThe results for the number of unbound TODGA molecules per extracted H2O also show trends across the Ln period. In the early Lns, specically for La and Ce it appears that there are different trends if organic phases contain 1-alcohols.

As Fig. 3 shows the ability for outer-sphere TODGA molecules to solubilize extracted H2O molecules, this gives insight into the D trends under acidic conditions. Specically, the Lns with larger D are also the Lns with a decrease in solubilization of H2O molecules by TODGA.\nSimilarly, the number of unbound TODGA molecules per extracted H+ cation were determined, via eqn (5) and are reported in Fig. 4. Several trends emerge which are similar to those found for the number of 1-alcohol molecules per extracted H2O molecule. At 5 vol% PM the trend is, 1-hexanol < 1- octanol < 1-decanol, however increasing the concentration to 30 vol%, results in the following trend, 1-decanol < 1-octanol < 1-hexanol. The trends across 1-alcohol alkyl chain lengths are reversed at low and high-volume fractions. This follows that an increase in unbound TODGA per H+ involves more TODGA molecules that are available to interact with H+. In previous literature FT-IR and 1H-NMR investigations have determined that H+ are responsible for the formation of (DGA)(HNO3)1\u20132 adducts.11,29,30 Extracted HNO3 molecules likely interact with TODGA through either direct protonation of the C]Omoiety or through hydrogen bonding interactions of the C]O moiety to a hydronium nitrate ion-pair.29 From an understanding of the importance of HNO3 in the formation of (DGA)(HNO3)1\u20132 adducts, increasing the number of unbound TODGA molecules per extracted H+, results in more aggregation. It is important to note that while noticeable changes in the number of unbound TODGA molecules per H+ are observed with increasing the concentration of 1-hexanol and 1-decanol, there appears to be little change with varying the 1-octanol concentration. This suggests that 1-octanol can balance the competing interactions of solubilizing the aggregates and not incidentally promoting TPF through an increased extraction of H2O molecules."

            "text": "To probe changes in molecular structure under the multitude of solution conditions studied FT-IR was used. A focus was placed on evaluating changes in the carbonyl, ether, and nitrate frequencies. Although the ether O is involved in coordination of TODGA to Ln, minor changes (1\u20132 cm\u22121) were observed aer an in-depth evaluation of the FT-IR spectra, which could be the result of dative interactions. Under the conditions employed here, there were no changes in the asymmetric nitrate stretch across the Ln period, which was observed at 1301 cm\u22121. This suggests that nitrates are not \u201cfree\u201d in solution but rather bound, likely participating in the hydrogen bonding network. Free nitrates are typically observed between 1320\u20131350 cm\u22121, whereas bound nitrates have a stretch between 1250\u2013 1310 cm\u22121.31 The frequency of nitrates in this system is consistent with the structure hypothesis that nitrates are involved in outer-sphere coordination. However, the role of nitrates in the outer-sphere is difficult to probe with FT-IR as the results cannot distinguish one interaction from another.32 For\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nthese reasons, only the carbonyl stretch was analyzed in detail. To develop a more in depth understanding of carbonyl peak features, the peaks were individually t in OriginLab (Fig. S20\u2013 S179\u2020) to determine the wavenumber, FWHM, and area. The frequency of the associated Ln-TODGA peak(s) are listed in Table S3,\u2020 for systems containing no modier, 5 vol% modier, and 30 vol% modier.\nThe C]O stretch from the fresh organic phase with no modiers appears at 1662 cm\u22121. This is consistent with previous TODGA and T2EHDGA literature values for the C]O stretch.30,33,34 Upon the addition of 5 vol% 1-alcohol, 1-hexanol and 1-decanol have a shoulder that is red-shied in comparison to the C]O stretch of the no modier system. A red shi (or decreasing frequency) is observed when the C]O bond, in this case, weakens. In contrast a blue shi (or increasing frequency) is associated with the strengthening of C]O bond or when dative bonds form.35,36 Increasing the 1-alcohol concentration to 30 vol%, results in a red-shied shoulder for 1-octanol and 1- decanol systems. The red-shi of the C]O stretch without contact with an aqueous phase suggests that 1-alcohols interact with the C]O motif on TODGA. This likely occurs through hydrogen bonding interactions as 1-alcohols act as a hydrogen donor and the C]O acts as a hydrogen acceptor.\nAer contact with 1 M HNO3, at 5 vol% the C]O stretch of 1- hexanol remains unchanged, whereas both 1-octanol and 1- decanol experience red-shis. At 30 vol% 1-alcohol, both 1- hexanol and 1-octanol have a red-shied C]O stretch, but 1- decanol is slightly blue-shied. When a change is not observed following 1 M HNO3 contact, this suggests that the interactions in the organic phase are similar to the interactions prior to contact. The systems that experienced a red-shi are consistent with the literature which explains this slight red shi to be the result of hydrogen bond interactions of HNO3 molecules interacting with polar carbonyl group of TODGA, forming (DGA)(HNO3)1-2 adducts.30,37,38 Across the varying alkyl chain lengths of 1-alcohol, the trend in this red-shied C]O frequency for 5 vol% is 1-hexanol < 1-octanol < 1-decanol. Increasing the 1-alcohol concentration to 30 vol% results in the reverse trend, 1-decanol < 1-octanol < 1-hexanol. Between each of the 1-alcohol systems, the change in frequency is 1\u20132 cm\u22121, suggesting only subtle changes.\nThe effects across the Ln period on Ln-TODGA interactions are reected the best in the modier-free systems. In these, the initial peak at 1662 cm\u22121 decreases in intensity across the period, with a corresponding ingrowth of a peak at 1620 cm\u22121 that increases in intensity with increasing Ln Z, as shown in Fig. 5. The initial carbonyl stretch is associated with (DGA)(HNO3)1\u20132 adducts, and the red-shied C]O stretch is associated with the extracted Ln-DGA complex. As the Ln-DGA complex C]O frequency is red-shied, this indicates a weaker C]O bond associated with the Ln-DGA complex compared to the stronger C]O bond in the (DGA)(HNO3)1-2 adducts.33 This behavior is not isolated to the systems considered herein, but has been reported with DOHyA,33 D3DODGA,38 T2EHDGA,39 TODGA,33 TODGA (+DHOA),40 TODGA (+1-octanol),40 and TODGA (+DOHyA)33 systems.

This suggests for higher Ln Ds, there is a decrease in the carbonyl intensity corresponding to the (DGA)(HNO3)1\u20132 adducts and an increase in the carbonyl intensity corresponding to the Ln-DGA complex.\nFor the systems studied herein, this corresponds to trends across the Ln period. As Ln Z increases, there is a decrease in the number of (TODGA)(HNO3)1\u20132 adducts until Gd, where a plateau forms, as evident by the decrease in intensity of the initial carbonyl peak. A decrease in the number of (TODGA)(HNO3)1\u20132 adducts is accompanied by an increase in the number of Ln-TODGA complexes. The results obtained from FT-IR support Ds (Fig. 2), where traversing the Ln period results in higher extraction of Ln and therefore a larger intensity of the C]O stretch that is attributed to Ln-TODGA interactions. Addition of PMs to the organic phase decreases the intensity of both carbonyl peaks, maintaining the same trend across the Ln period for the modier-free system. The complete shi in both C]O stretches occurs when the C]O stretch associated with (TODGA)(HNO3)1-2 adducts is at a minimum and the C]O stretch associated with the Ln-DGA complex is at a maximum, where neither are changing with the addition of Ln or HNO3. A complete shi of C]O stretches, has been correlated with TPF, where polar\u2013polar interactions of the extracted species dominate the solution.33 Across the Ln period, the LOC decreases,15 suggesting the behavior observed in FT-IR carbonyl intensities might be a product of organic phase micro-structure approaching that found in TPF.\nIn all systems studied the trend in carbonyl frequency for the red-shied Ln\u2013O]C interaction, rst decreases from La\u2013Gd and then slightly increases from Tb\u2013Lu. This suggests a stronger C]O bond associated with Ln-TODGA complexes for the heavier Lns. Investigations with organophosphorus extractants reported that the strength of ligand interactions cannot be related to various M\u2013O interactions.41,42 Instead, either Far-IR or Raman Spectroscopy are required to determine the frequency of\n6024 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 6017\u20136026\nM\u2013O interactions. Without understanding the Ln\u2013O bond strengths, it is difficult to make conclusions about the relationship of C]O bond strength to the Ln\u2013O bond strength.\nThe frequency of the Ln\u2013O]C stretch across the Ln period exhibits an interesting trend which cannot be explained by the reduced mass effect. If this were the case, increasing Z would result in a constant decrease in frequency.35 As that does not follow the observed behavior it can be concluded that these changes in frequency across the Ln period do not reect the effect of reduced mass on the vibrations of Ln-TODGA complexes. The relationship of Ln\u2013O]C frequency with increasing Z resembles the trend in unbound TODGA per extracted H2Omolecule (Fig. 3). These results provide insight to the frequency trend of the Ln\u2013O]C stretch across the Ln period might be a product of hydrogen bonding interactions."

            "text": "The effects of alkyl chain length on 1-alcohols and its impact on Ds, concentration of H2O and H\n+ in the bulk organic phase of TODGA extraction systems, and probing coordination trends through FT-IR investigations, are reported. These results showed with 5 vol% 1-alcohol, there is a consistent increase in the D compared to systems with no PM. Increasing the PM concentration to 30 vol% leads to a different trend in Ds, except for 1-octanol. This trend differs by experiencing a decrease in the D at Gd, where the remainder of the Lns have Ds that are lower than expected.\nComparison of Ds to extracted H2O and H + provided a better understanding as to the importance of hydrogen bonding networks in TODGA systems. At low PM concentrations (5 vol%), the normalized organic phase concentration of H2O and number of unbound TODGA per extracted H+ suggests that 1-hexanol is better at suppressing aggregation through efficient solubilization of the Ln-TODGA complex. At higher concentrations of PM (30 vol%), the opposite trend in 1-alcohol alkyl chain lengths was established, which suggests 1-decanol forms the smallest particles. In support of this, the number of unbound TODGA per H+ resulted in less available TODGA to interact with H+ for longer 1-alcohol alkyl chains. The combination of these results suggests a competition of two effects, solubilization of the Ln-DGA aggregates and incidentally causing TPF.\nThe trend in Ds for a TODGA system under acidic conditions was found to resemble the trend in unbound TODGA per extracted H2O molecules. Similarly, to Ln Ds, a plateau forms around Tb in the number of unbound TODGA per H2O. This suggests that extraction of Ln may be related to the relationship between outer-sphere TODGA molecules and extracted H2O. Similarly, the ability for a system to suppress aggregation in the organic phase can be related to the number of unbound TODGA per extracted H+, where a decrease in the number of unbound TODGA per H+ is correlated with a suppression of aggregates.\nThe relationships that exist between Ln, TODGA, H2O, H +, and 1-alcohol are reected in FT-IR results.

The trends in Ln\u2013O]C frequency across the Ln period reected the trends in unbound TODGA per extracted H2O. This suggested that changes to the hydrogen bonding network are responsible for the trends established with increasing Ln Z. These results have showed the importance of the relationship between Ln, TODGA, H2O, H\n+, and 1-alcohol in establishing a hydrogen bonding network responsible for the unique trends in Ln extraction.\nOverall, this study provided insight as to the importance of doing a multi-faceted approach to characterize the organic phase of these TODGA systems, through understanding the relationship between extraction of Ln, H+, H2O coupled with probing coordination. Based on the results provided herein, the 30 vol% 1-octanol system is of particular interest for Ln separations as is has the largest Dy/Nd separation factor. Application to industry (i.e., hydrometallurgical processes) requires additional studies in higher acid concentrations (3 M HNO3) to probe systems that are more relevant to practical applications. Coupling solvent extraction results with spectroscopic techniques to probe coordination will be instrumental in developing a relationship of organic phase structure and extraction of Lns."
