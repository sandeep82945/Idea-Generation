"In this paper, we have leveraged graph-based community detection methods to gather insights into each of the most significant candidatesâ€™ online campaigns for the 2022 French presidential election. We have been able to build a portrait of the average voter for each candidate, the interest they carry in different political subjects, their geolocalization, and their language habits. We have also presented results on the usage of automated accounts, or the lack thereof, in each community. Based on the community detection of political communities, a relevant study could be to analyze of the impact of major political events or debates. French elections are based on a two-turn system, with the first turn aiming at narrowing down the list of candidates and only keeping the two largest ones."
