Structural Modification for Reduced Toxicity: The paper suggests that structural modifications, such as adding sulphonate or sulphamate groups to the phytocompounds, may reduce their toxicity and make them more suitable for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. Further research could focus on the synthesis of these modified compounds and evaluate their efficacy and safety in both in vitro and in vivo models. This could involve chemical synthesis approaches, followed by pharmacological testing for ChE inhibition and toxicity assessment.

Investigation into the Mechanisms of Action: While the paper outlines the inhibitory activities of various compounds from MC on AChE and BChE, detailed studies on the mechanisms of action are warranted. Research could delve into how these compounds interact with ChE at the molecular level, using techniques like crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and advanced computational methods to map the binding sites and elucidate the inhibition mechanism. Such studies could provide insights into the design of more potent and selective inhibitors.

Broad-Spectrum Neuroprotective Studies: Given the neuroprotective activities suggested by the inhibition of AChE and BChE, expanding the research to investigate the broader spectrum of neuroprotective effects of MC extracts and their compounds would be valuable. This could include studies on their antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic potentials, using cellular and animal models of neurodegeneration beyond AD, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.

Development of MC-based Therapeutics for AD: Building on the initial findings, further research could aim at the development and formulation of MC-based therapeutics for AD. This would involve pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dose-optimization studies, followed by preclinical and clinical trials to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these treatments in humans. Part of this research could also explore the use of MC extracts as a complementary therapy alongside existing AD treatments.

Exploring Anti-insectant Potential: The paper highlights the antiinsectant properties of some MC-derived compounds. Future studies could explore this avenue further by investigating the insecticidal activities of these compounds against a broader range of insect pests. Research could also focus on the development of environmentally friendly insecticides based on MC compounds, including formulation development, efficacy testing against various pests, and assessing the environmental impact and safety for non-target organisms.
