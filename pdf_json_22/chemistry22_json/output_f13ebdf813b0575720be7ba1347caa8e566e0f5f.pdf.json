    "abstractText": "A detailed molecular fingerprint of raw pyrolysis oil from plastic wastes is a new research area. The present study focuses for the first time on the chemical recycling of plastic marine litter; we aim to chemically characterize the obtained raw pyrolysis oil and its distillates (virgin naphtha and marine gasoil) via GC-MS and FT-IR. For all samples, more than 30% of the detected compounds were identified. 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, a marker of PP pyrolysis, is the most represented peak in the chemical signature of all the marine litter pyrolysis samples, and it differentiates commercial and pyrolysis marine gasoil. The presence of naphthalenes is stronger in commercial gasoil, compared to its pyrolysis analog, while the opposite holds for olefins. The overlap between the two molecular fingerprints is impressive, even if saturated hydrocarbons are more common in commercial gasoil, and unsaturated compounds are more common in the gasoil derived from pyrolysis. A technical comparison between the commercial marine gasoil and the one obtained from the marine litter pyrolysis is also attempted. Gasoil derived from marine litter fully complies with the ISO8217 standards for distillate marine fuel. On the other hand, the virgin naphtha is particularly rich in BTX, ethylbenzene, styrene, and alpha olefins, which are all important recoverable platform chemicals for industrial upcycling.",

            "text": "Plastic waste is a long-lasting and worldwide ecological problem. Plastic has becomethe emblem of waste (disposable objects), pollution, and ecotoxicity. It is estimated that in 2018, an estimated 14.5 million tons of plastics entered the ocean [1], building up each year a stock of plastic waste undergoing progressive fragmentation and releasing microparticles that enter the food chain with unknown consequences. Personal protective and single-use products associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic will probably increase the quantities of plastic entering the oceans [2]. Landfilling, incineration with or without energy recovery, and recycling are common ways to manage plastic waste. However, safe landfilling is expensive and does not fit the sustainable circular economy vision; incineration may lead to the emission of harmful greenhouse gases (NOx, SOx, COx, etc.) and other toxic volatiles. Noteworthy is that not all plastics can be mechanically recycled, considering their degradation states, complex compositions, or mixtures with other substances [3]; and sorting mixed plastic waste is a labor intensive and expensive prerequisite of the process since most plastics are not compatible with each other and can\u2019t be processed together during recycling [4]. This is particularly true for plastic marine litter, which is mainly landfilled or incinerated [5].\nSustainability 2022, 14, 1235. https://doi.org/10.3390/su14031235 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2022, 14, 1235 2 of 17\nIn this context, chemical recycling, specifically pyrolysis, provides a promising way to upcycle plastic wastes, and it can be used to produce fuels or important chemical building blocks for the petrochemical industry. The main advantage of the pyrolysis process over the mechanical recycling process is the fact that it does not need sorting and cleaning steps, at least to a great extent, which is obviously beneficial to treat difficult feedstocks, such as plastic marine litter, which is often collected as \u201cbycatch\u201d by fishermen and must be separated from the catch with loss of time and additional work. The pyrolysis of plastic generates a gas fraction, a liquid fraction (pyrolysis oil), which is composed of several hydrocarbon species (depending on process conditions and plastic type), and solid residues, [6,7]. The economics of the process is interesting because the production cost of pyrolysis fuel is ca. 10 times lower than the market fuel prices in the case of a 10,000 kg/h plant [8]; and in the case of marine litter, the conversion into \u201cdrop in\u201d fuels can become an effective nonmonetary reward for the depollution of the ocean. Another important motivation for producing pyrolysis oil from waste plastic is an overall reduction of about 30% in NOx, CO, and HC emissions observed in comparison with neat diesel [9]. Even if the circular economy approach to plastic waste management does not fully endorse chemical recycling, since produced fuels are just energy carriers, there are at least three cases in which the latter approach is the best strategy: (i) nonrecycled plastics, defined as the rejected streams (unable to be processed due to certain restrictions) that remain in the mechanical recycling centers, (ii) hospital plastics that might involve a severe biohazard, and (iii) highly nonhomogeneous and contaminated plastic waste, such as marine litter, which also comprises a wide array of other nonplastic materials, such as biomass, sand, clothes, glass, metals, etc. Besides, the light distillate of pyrolysis oil can become the feedstock for the synthesis of second-generation raw polymers using existing technologies, such as steam cracking, thus providing a new perspective about the potential of chemical recycling to deliver second-generation raw materials and hence its full integration within the circular economy concept [4,10]. Pyrolysis oil and its distillates were often characterized as regards their physical\u2013 chemical properties and compliance with ASTM and ISO standards; their chemical composition was analyzed via GC-MS, the most eligible technique, due to the volatile nature of the compounds and/or their possible volatilization in the heated injection port of the gas-chromatograph. However, in many studies, the absence of a scrupulous description of the sampling procedure prevents any comment on the experimental outcomes since the preanalytical step strongly influences the results; light compounds are often missing probably because the solvent used to prepare the oil solutions to be injected interferes with the detection of the most volatile compounds. The pyrolysis oils that were tested via GC-MS were usually obtained from specific kinds of plastics [11\u201314] or their partial mixture [15], and a meticulous molecular description of the samples was usually omitted. In this respect, common model plastics were PS [16\u201318]; PET, HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, and PVC [11]; HDPE, LDPE, PP, and PS [19]; PE [20,21]; LDPE and HDPE [22]; LDPE, the mixture of HDPE and LDPE, PP, and HDPE [23]; PP [24]; and PP and LDPE [25]. The complete chemical fingerprint of the pyrolysis oil from mixed plastic waste was rarely studied, and only a few compounds were usually identified in their pyrolysis oils, while analytes were usually not detailed since they were grouped according to specific criteria, such as the carbon number or chemical class [26]. Only very few studies provided the complete molecular description of pyrolysis oils from mixed plastic waste: Lopez et al. studied the pyrolysis oil from rejected streams that was unable to be processed due to restrictions, which come from industrial plants where plastic wastes are classified and separated for their subsequent mechanical recycling. They found that the end product was a complex mixture of organic compounds containing more than 70% of valuable chemicals (styrene, toluene, ethyl-benzene, and alpha-methylstyrene); branched alkanes and alkenes were missing [14]. Cho et al. focused on BTX and other aromatics yield\nSustainability 2022, 14, 1235 3 of 17\nfrom the pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste from a recycling facility; aliphatic compounds were not detailed. The reaction temperature had a positive effect on the BTX yield [27]. A high resemblance of pyrolysis oil from municipal plastic waste with standard diesel was demonstrated on the basis of thorough GC-MS analyses, even if the sampling conditions were not detailed, and compounds lighter than C8 alkanes and C7 aromatics were not detected [28]. From the review of the literature, it follows that, to date, only a few studies describe a detailed molecular fingerprint of pyrolysis oil from plastics wastes, and just two studies deal also with the characterization of its distillates. Singh et al. indicated 13 major compounds in pyrolysis oil from mixed plastics and compared its composition to that of HDPE, PP, and PS pyrolysis oil; the most abundant hydrocarbon fraction in pyrolysis oil based on carbon number is the C5-C12 fraction. The distilled fraction with a boiling point up to 240 \u25e6C was found to contain 13.85% 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, 8.67% 1,1,3,4-tetramethyl cyclopentane, 4.35% 2-Octen-4-one, 4.27% 1,3,5-trimethyl cyclohexane, and higher quantity of the C9 and C10 compounds and branched alkanes and alkenes [29]. The rejected fraction of the packaging waste was pyrolyzed. GC-MS results for the pyrolysis oil and its distillate revealed high levels of aromatics (recoverable building blocks for industrial use), alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, cycloalkenes, and oxygenated compounds for a total of 33 analytes. However, the authors did not describe how the samples were processed. Styrene was the principal aromatic compound, followed by ethylbenzene and toluene [3]. Noteworthy is that no investigation (neither exhaustive nor general) on the chemical composition of the raw pyrolysis oil (and its distillates) from marine litter is available in the scientific literature. Taking into account this scarcity of available data and the fact that pyrolysis oil from plastic waste can lead to alternative fuels and valuable chemicals for a more sustainable industry, we believe that it is crucial to provide the detailed chemical composition and obtain a molecular fingerprint of the fuels that can be obtained via the chemical recycling of the marine litter for both scientific and commercial reasons. In the following, we describe the pyrolysis process of the marine litter and its characterization, especially at the molecular level via the GC-MS analysis of the raw pyrolysis oil (RPO ml-py) and its distilled fractions, namely, virgin naphtha (VN ml-py) and marine gasoil (MGO ml-py). The FTIR analysis provides an additional chemical signature of the samples. A comparison between the molecular signature of the MGO obtained from marine litter pyrolysis and the commercial MGO is also carried out along with their physicochemical characterization. This comparison may pave the way to the removal of regulatory barriers within a chemical recycling regulatory framework."

            "text": "Within the EU project \u201cMapping and recycling of marine litter and Ghost nets on the sea floor\u201d (marGnet), more than 200 kg of actual plastic marine litter was collected from the sea bottom of the Venice Lagoon and north Adriatic Sea by scuba divers with the goal to pyrolyze it \u201cas it is\u201d without any sorting or pretreatment and upgrade the pyrolysis oil to ISO-compliant marine fuel by means of distillation. The focus on sunk litter is justified because it is estimated that as much as 70% of marine debris sinks to the seabed, and even low-density polymers can lose buoyancy under the weight of fouling [30]. Although a precise characterization of the plastic litter was not possible due to the high amount of dirt and organic incrustation or the lack of identifying markings, two thirds of the collected plastic litter were general plastic containers, such as hard boxes and packaging films, plastic bottles, plastic nets from mussel farming, and a few boat components, and one third was fishing nets. This is confirmed in literature where it is reported that plastic items, bags, and fishing equipment are the largest part of the debris at sea [31], and benthic marine litter in the central Mediterranean Sea is composed of 68% general plastic objects and 32% fishing gear [32]. A small contribution of floating litter mainly composed of styrofoam and floating\nSustainability 2022, 14, 1235 4 of 17\ncontainers was also included in the feedstock. The great majority of postconsumer plastic waste is made from just three polymer families: PE, PP, and PET [33], while the fishing nets are mainly made of nylons (6 and 6.6) and PE, and mussel nets are made of PP, we can assume that the composition of the plastic marine litter was essentially made of polyolefins and polyamides with contributions of polystyrene and rubber. Organic matter, such as seaweed, mussel residue, etc., was the main recognizable contaminant along with sand. Nonplastic items easily recognizable, such as glass bottles and metals cages, were manually segregated and removed during collection. Scrap tires were also present as litter in the sea, but their pyrolysis products are not discussed in this work."

A shell and tube AISI 304 stainless steel 0.42 m2 condenser, water-cooled, located just at the outlet of the pyrolysis reactor collected the vapors of RPO (ml-py) in a receiving tank. Noncondensable gas was flared after conditioning. The operation was batchwise, and 14 pyrolysis cycles were performed with loads of dry plastic marine litter ranging from a minimum of 4 kg to a maximum of 11.5 kg for a total of 100 kg. Each pyrolysis cycle lasted 4 h from start to end. Pyrolysis oil collected from each cycle was homogenized in order to provide the overall mean composition. After every pyrolysis cycle, the reactor was cleaned and solid residues were removed. A total of 1 kg of calcium oxide-based additive (content of CaO > 57 wt%; CaO + MgO > 92 wt%; CalcePiasco, Italy) was added to the feedstock in the reactor for each cycle to avoid the formation of acidic compounds, such as hydrochloric acid and other organic acids, as also described elsewhere [34]. Mass balance was 45 wt% RPO (ml-py), 26 wt% noncondensed gas, and 26 wt% solid residues (net of additive)."

Three replicate samples were used for the chromatographic analysis. A Hewlett Packard GC-MS, G1800C GCD Series II (Palo Alto, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped- with an HP-5MS column 30 m \u00d7 0.25 mmI.D. \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness (HewlettPackard) was used. The mass spectrometer was tuned before the analyses via a reference gas (perfluorotributylamine) across the full mass range. The injector was set at 325 \u25e6C and operated in the split mode (split ratio 1:240). The carrier gas was helium with a constant flow of 1 mL/min; the oven temperature was held isothermal at 30 \u25e6C for 15 min, then programmed from 30 \u25e6C to 100 \u25e6C at 5 \u25e6C/min, and then programmed from 100 \u25e6C to 325 \u25e6C at 10 \u25e6C/min and held isothermal at 325 \u25e6C for 10 min. Mass spectra were acquired in the electron impact mode (70 eV), using a full scan with mass analysis in the range 10 atomic mass units (amu)\u2013450 atomic mass units (amu). The ion source and the quadrupole were\nSustainability 2022, 14, 1235 5 of 17\nheated by conduction. A total of 2.500 mL of each sample were filtered to remove organic materials larger than 5 \u00b5m and put in 5 mL headspace vial, closed by PTFE/silicone septum. Both the liquid phase and the volatiles in the headspace of the samples were analyzed, respectively, via the direct injection of 1 \u00b5l of the liquid in the injection port of the GC-MS and HS-SPME-GC-MS. SPME fibers were obtained from the Supelco Company (Bellefonte, PA, USA). The fiber (divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane 50/30 \u00b5m) was selected because it is considered the most universal [35\u201338]; it was conditioned before use, as recommended by the manufacturer. Before extraction, the stabilization of the headspace in the vial was reached by equilibration for 30 min at 30 \u25e6C \u00b1 0.1 \u25e6C. Volatiles were then adsorbed for exactly 10 h at 30 \u25e6C \u00b1 0.1 \u25e6C. After extraction, injections provided the fiber thermal desorption into the GC-MS injection port equipped with a 0.75 mm i.d. inlet liner. Before the subsequent sampling, the fiber was reconditioned for 5 min at 325 \u25e6C. Blank runs (empty injections) were done periodically during the study to reveal possible carryover. Carryover never occurred. The identification of the analytes was based on the comparison of their retention times with those of standards obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy). The purity of the volatile standards was usually 97% or higher. In the absence of a commercial standard, peak identification was carried out by (i) computer matching of mass spectral data with those of compounds contained in the Mass Spectral Library of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 1998 library); the quality of the match above 98% was needed for positive identification; (ii) comparison of their linear retention indices [37,39] relative to n-alkanes, calculated using a straight-chain alkane mixture, with the averaged values reported in the bibliography for chromatographic columns similar to that used. Only compounds with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 5 were considered. The relative proportions of the constituents in the samples were obtained using the percentage area of chromatographic peaks, as usual [35\u201339]. The statistical analysis of the variance was performed via the data analysis tool in Microsoft \u00ae Excel for Mac, version 16.16.26 (200914) \u00a9 2022 Microsoft."

The answer was to convert marine litter into marine fuels, being a sort of payback for fishermen and other stakeholders involved in the collection activity. Giving back the fuel obtained from the litter the fishermen delivered was a great nonmonetary instrument to attain greater involvement of stakeholders and thus an efficient sea clean up. However, to do so, the produced fuel must be fully compatible with commercial marine gasoil so that no technical issue could arise upon its usage. Compliance with conventional fuel is also crucial to avoid skepticism among stakeholders. Therefore, among the marine fuels classified according to ISO 8217, the highest quality ones, DMX and DMA, were targeted.

Figure 2 details the cumulative average percent area of the identified compounds. Noteworthy, the BTX, ethylbenzene, styrene, and alpha-methylstyrene contents in VN (ml-py) are ca. twofold compared to MGO (ml-py). This is important because they are potentially recoverable platform chemicals for industrial application. BTX separation from petroleum naphtha is state-of-the-art technology, and it is generally performed by liquid\u2013 liquid extraction with sulfolane [43,44]. Removing BTX from VN (ml-py) would attain a double result: obtaining valuable aromatics for the chemical industry and aromaticfree naphtha, the ideal feedstock for the steam cracking process and the synthesis of polyolefins, and hence, new virgin PE and PP polymers [43]. Besides, building blocks from the pyrolysis are often the monomers of the processed polymers (e.g., styrene) that can be subsequently polymerized again [3]. This latter development is a work in progress at present. Similarly, the content of light aliphatic compounds ranging between C5 and C11 is higher in VN (ml-py) compared to MGO (ml-py); in particular, the contents of the C5\u2013C7 compounds and the C8\u2013C9 compounds in VN (ml-py) are at least fivefold and threefold, respectively, compared to MGO (ml-py). In VN (ml-py), aliphatic compounds with a number of carbon atoms higher than 22 were not detected. On the contrary, the content of aliphatic compounds ranging between C12 and C28 is higher in MGO (ml-py) compared to VN (ml-py), as expected. Many specific compounds detailed in Table 2 were already found in pyrolysis oils from specific plastic materials or mixed plastic waste. The general aspects of the pyrolytic degradation mechanism of polymers involve three kinds of chain reactions viz. polymeric chain scissions, side group reactions, and recombination\nSustainability 2022, 14, 1235 10 of 17\nreactions. For example, the thermal degradation of both HDPE and PP yielded alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes; double-bonded hydrocarbons compounds are generated via the single-bonded carbon (C\u2013C) dissociation in a polyalkane structure and the stabilization of free radicals produced from the chain scissoring mechanism [29]. From the data in Table 2, it is clear that olefins (alkenes, cycloalkenes, and polyenes) constitute a very important family of pyrolysis compounds, comprising 40.45%, 23.23%, and 22.08% of the area of VN (ml-py), MGO (ml-py), and RPO (ml-py) samples, respectively; it follows that VN (ml-py) might be an interesting source of these precious building blocks for the chemical industry. Linear alpha olefins (normal alpha olefins) from 1-hexene to 1-tridecene were typical of HDPE pyrolysis, and 1-heptene and 1-octene were also found to be markers of the PP pyrolysis [11]. We found these compounds to be very expedient in the chemical industry. They are lighter in terms of the homologous series of the linear alpha olefins up to 1-octene and are used (i) as a comonomer in the production of polyethylene and (ii) as feedstock for the hydroformylation process to produce linear aldehyde via oxo synthesis and, subsequently, short-chain fatty acids (via aldehyde oxidation) or linear alcohols (via aldehyde hydrogenation) for plasticizer applications. Abundant amounts of C10-C13 linear alpha olefins can be upcycled in making surfactants: their reaction with benzene generates linear alkylbenzenes (LAB), and their subsequent sulfonation yields linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LABS), which is a popular low-cost surfactant for household and industrial detergent applications. Alkynes were seldomly identified. Alkanes and cycloalkanes constantly represent ca. 25% of the eluted area for all samples. PP methyl side groups were reported to increase the yield of branched hydrocarbons and alkenes compared to PE [29,45]. Actually, we found, as detailed in Table 2, 2-methyl-1-pentene, 2,4-dimethyl-1heptene, and 3-methylcyclopentene related to PP, as well as trimethyl cyclohexanes [11,29] and many other branched hydrocarbons and alkenes. The largest eluted percent area in the VN (ml-py), MGO (ml-py), and RPO (ml-py) samples is constantly due to 2,4-dimethyl1-heptene, which represents 16.51%, 4.26%, and 2.74% of the area, respectively. A major source of aromatic building blocks in the pyrolysis oil is PS breakdown, which involves the elimination of styrene moieties thereby increasing the number of aromatic compounds in pyrolysis oil; in addition, PET is a contributor as it is reported that PET pyrolysis leads to a benzene-rich pyrolysis oil, in particular, high temperatures and slow heating rates maximize the amount of aromatics and the selectivity of benzene [46]. However, in this work, pyrolysis was performed in the presence of calcium-based additives, and PET decomposes into terephthalic and benzoic acids at 350 \u25e6C, which are subsequently decarboxylated into aromatics thanks to CaO. Kumagai et al. reported an increase in benzene yield when terephthalic acid is decarboxylated in the presence of CaO [47,48]. As regards aromatics identified and detailed in Table 2, benzene, toluene, and xylenes may come from multiple plastic waste sources (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, and PET), while ethylbenzene was related to PP and PS pyrolysis; styrene, propyl benzene, and 1-ethyl-2methylbenzene were particularly reported to be markers of PS pyrolysis [11]. Even if [13] it was reported that no aromatic groups were identified in the pyrolysis oil from virgin PP and HDPE, it is well known that aromatics are generated during PP pyrolysis from secondary reactions via cyclization and aromatization reactions, especially at high processing temperatures and heating rates [12]; the low molecular weight olefins (C2\u2013C5) from PE and PP may undergo the Diels\u2013Alder intermolecular cyclization and radical intramolecular cyclization. A subsequent dehydrogenation process rationalizes the formation of aromatic compounds [49\u201352]. Furthermore, the interactions of different plastic wastes during the pyrolysis process were reported to increase the content of aromatic compounds [53\u201356]. In Table 2, the presence of trimethylbenzenes, indane, and indene can be related to LDPE pyrolysis, even if indene was also related to PP [11]. Naphthalene is generated by the LDPE and PS pyrolysis, while 1-methylnaphthalene, dimethyl naphthalenes, and trimethyl naphthalenes are markers of PVC and LDPE pyrolysis. Biphenyl was related to PET, PVC, and PP pyrolysis feedstocks [11]. Oxygen and nitrogen compounds were previously reported to be a residual fraction in pyrolysis oil samples [3,13,27,57]; actually, only benzonitrile was\nSustainability 2022, 14, 1235 11 of 17\nidentified (both in distillates and in the RPO). The lack of oxygenated compounds among those identified in Table 2 is expedient since high oxygen content results in low calorific value, corrosion problems, and instability; the presence of PS can drastically abate the oxygen content, thereby mimicking the diesel standard [57]. Some putative sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen compounds were detected but not positively identified.\nSustainability 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 19\ninvolves the elimination of styrene moieties thereby increasing the number of aromatic\ncompounds in pyrolysis oil; in addition, PET is a contributor as it is reported that PET\npyrolysis leads to a benzene-rich pyrolysis oil, in particular, high temperatures and slow\nheating rates maximize the amount of aromatics and the selectivity of benzene [46].

Those for MGO (ml-py) are 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene (4.26%), hexadecane (1.83%), and 1-tridecene (1.71%), followed by linear alkanes and alpha-olefins. For RPO (ml-py) we have 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene (2.74%), styrene (2.28%), and ethylbenzene (2.1%), mainly followed by linear alkanes with a carbon number higher than 13. For MGO (comm), the most represented compounds are tridecane (2.65%), undecane (2.40%), and dodecane (2.36%), followed by linear alkanes with a carbon number higher than 10. It can be confirmed that 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, detected in all samples obtained from the pyrolysis but in MGO (comm), is a good putative marker of the plastic origin of the fuel. From Figure 3 it is clear that the olefin content is significantly higher in samples from pyrolysis, while paraffins are characteristic of MGO (comm). VN is the richest sample as regards olefins. In an attempt to go more in depth with the comparison and to confirm or disconfirm similarities, Figure 4 illustrates the averaged percent area of identified analyte in MGO (comm) and MGO (ml-py). The presence of massive amounts of 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene in the MGO from marine litter pyrolysis oil (ml-py), due to the PP presence [43], differentiate the GC-MS fingerprints of these samples. The presence of naphthalenes is stronger in commercial MGO, compared to its pyrolysis analog. Notwithstanding this, MGO (ml-py) is compliant with ISO8217 specifications as regards marine gasoil, and the incomplete overlap between the molecular fingerprints of MGO (comm) and MGO (ml-py), as evident from Table 2, does not underscore an a priori better or worse performance of the fuel based on marine litter. Further testing of MGO (ml-py) as regards emissions and other parameters is a work in progress since pyrolyzed oil-based fuels could lead to reduced emissions [9,19].\nSustainability 2022, 14, 1235 12 of 17\nSustainability 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 19 The top three compounds in the eluted area for the VN (ml-py) are 2,4-dimethyl-1heptene (16.51%), 1-hexene (2.87%), and 4-methylheptane (2.30%) followed by short-chain alpha-olefins.

This goal can be achieved through chemical recycling using pyrolysis and distillation. Following this route, plastic marine litter collected from the sea bottom of the northern Adriatic Sea was processed \u201cas it is\u201d and converted into useful ISO-compliant marine gasoil and useful material for the chemical industry. Since marine litter is probably the most difficult waste to upcycle, the same approach could be applied to all kinds of rejected plastic waste and highly nonhomogeneous plastic streams, which do not find a proper recycling solution. Compliance of waste-derived MGO (ml-pl) with ISO8217 standards is demonstrated, and its chemical composition is finally revealed, which is different from the one of conventional MGO (comm). In particular, the presence of massive amounts of 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene can be considered the chemical signature of plastic-derived fuels and might be used as tracer for its presence for commercialization and blending. A significant amount of valuable aromatics (BTX) then alkenes, cycloalkenes, and polyenes suggest that VN (ml-py) might be an interesting source of these precious building blocks for the chemical industry and even be used as alternative feedstock for the production of virgin polymers using state-of-the-art technologies. A future outlook will be the use of distillates derived from marine litter in steam cracking equipment for the manifacturing of ethilene and propylene to be polymerized into virgin PE and PP.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.C.F. and T.C.; methodology, G.C.F. and T.C.; investigation G.C.F. and T.C.; writing, G.C.F. and T.C.; visualization, G.C.F. and T.C..; supervision, G.C.F.; project administration, G.C.F.; funding acquisition, G.C.F.
