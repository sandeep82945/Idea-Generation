We examined agespecific death rates, focusing on deaths above age 60 years, and at 15-59 years. We compared these to\nthe United Nations (UN) estimates of age-specific mortality in 2019.\nFindings The survey participants were broadly similar to the 2020 census and other national surveys in age, sex, region, and smoking status, but had lower SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates and higher education levels. There were no differences between reporting of deaths during the Omicron period versus earlier. The survey captured 456 deaths, of which 329 occurred at ages 60+ years and 212 were women. At ages 60+ years, death rates per 1000 rose 242% (95%CI 128-398%) during December 2022- January 2023. Deaths at ages 15-59 years did not rise appreciably. The UN estimates approximately 675,000 deaths per month at ages 60+ years in 2019. If rates doubled nationally as in our survey, China\nhad approximately 1\u00b735 million excess deaths over the two months.\nInterpretation China experienced a sharp but short increase in excess deaths among its elderly during the Omicron wave. If death registry data corroborate our estimates of substantial excess deaths in China, the worldwide estimates of excess deaths to 2023 may need upward adjustment.\nFunding Canadian Institutes of Health Research"

For participants with at least one death in\nthe family since Lunar New Year (January 25) 2020, another dichotomous variable (1=since November\n2021, 0=earlier) captured deaths that occurred after the arrival of the Omicron variant.\nWe smoothed the study\u2019s monthly death rates using 3-month rolling averages (although 2-month and\n4-month averages showed similar patterns; data not shown). The numerator of the monthly death\nrates was the number of deaths by age group by month. The denominator was the sum of all family\nmembers by age group and month (Appendix 2).\nWe used China\u2019s population and deaths reported on the World Population Prospects 2022 by the\nUnited Nations Population Division to calculate the national age-specific death rates from 2012-2019. 5\nWe divided the annual rates by 12 to obtain the average monthly rates. We used logistic regression to\ndetermine the likelihood of having a death in the family vs. not, and of having any death in the family\nsince November 2021 vs. any earlier death since Lunar New Year (January 25) 2020. We used Poisson\nregression, with appropriate confidence intervals, to estimate changes in the age-specific survey death\nrates during Dec 2022-Jan 2023 compared to earlier periods. We used Stata/MP 17 to conduct all\nanalyses. 12 Our data and codebook are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ChinaStudy2023."

            "text": "About 210,000 panelists were invited, of whom 8,004 completed the full survey. The response rate of\nabout 4% is typical of comparable online surveys in China. Our sample was broadly representative of\nthe regional population distribution of China\u2019s 31 administrative regions (Table 1). Compared to the\n2020 census and other national surveys, study participants were broadly representative by age, sex,\nregion, and smoking status, but had lower SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates and higher education levels.\nHouseholds reporting a death differed little from those that did not, except for more deaths occurring\nin households with a smoker and fewer deaths in more educated households. There were no\ndifferences between reporting of deaths during the Omicron period versus earlier.\nThe survey captured 456 deaths, of which 329 occurred at 60+ years and 212 were women. At 60+\nyears, the average death rates per 1000 fluctuated but rose 242% (95%CI 128-398%) during December\n2022-January 2023 (Figure 1). Survey death rates at these ages were lower than the UN death rates,\nwhich are more complete as they draw upon death registration and census data. Death rates at ages\n15-59 showed less fluctuation and were closer to the UN death rates.\nUsing the UN estimates, China had about 8\u00b71 million deaths at ages 60+ in 2019, 5 which (ignoring\nseasonality) equates to approximately 675,000 deaths monthly. If death rates doubled nationally\nduring December 2022-January 2023, as they clearly did so in our survey, mainland China had 1\u00b735\nmillion excess deaths at 60+ years.\nDiscussion\nOur estimate of 1\u00b735 million excess deaths in China\u2019s last SARS-CoV-2 wave is crude by necessity, but\nconsistent results drawn on modelling based on increases in cremations 13 and death registration data\nin China\u2019s special administrative regions. Hong Kong saw about 70% excess deaths in March-April 2022\n(when the increase in cases was smaller than in December 2022-January 2023) and Macau saw about\n170% excess deaths during the later peak. 14 Both regions have better health systems and reporting\nthan the whole of China. Our estimate is lower than that based on internet searches for funerals. 15\nExcess deaths were concentrated at ages 60+ also during the original wave of spring 2020. 2\nAdditionally, China has high overall vaccination coverage of 90%, but its elderly are disproportionally\nless fully (3-doses) vaccinated. 16\nWe did not observe over-reporting of deaths during the Omicron wave versus earlier. Indeed, we\nsequenced questions to avoid such spurious reporting. Nevertheless, sample surveys generally\nunderestimate deaths 17 and are no substitute for timely release of China\u2019s high-quality death\nregistration data. China\u2019s 2025 Census and its Disease Surveillance Point system (covering 20% of the\npopulation) could each quantify excess deaths directly by reporting deaths from January 2020 onward\nby location, age, sex, and date.\nDespite an older population, China's excess deaths during the Omicron wave of December 2022-\nJanuary 2023 were about half of what India experienced during its very large Delta wave of April-May\n2021. 2-4 If indeed China had substantial excess deaths in late 2022/early 2023, they would suggest a\nsignificant upward revision of worldwide excess deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection through mid-2023\nfrom the estimated 13-17 million deaths as of December 2021. 3"
