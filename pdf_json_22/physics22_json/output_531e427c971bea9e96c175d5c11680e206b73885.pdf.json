The boundary sites are representations of a \u2217-subalgebra \u039e \u2286 D(G) and we explicate its structure as a quasi-Hopf \u2217-algebra dependent on a choice of transversal R. We provide decomposition formulae for irreducible representations of D(G) pulled back to \u039e. As an application of our treatment, we study patches with boundaries based on K = G horizontally and K = {e} vertically and show how these could be used in a quantum computer using the technique of lattice surgery. More abstractly, we also provide explicitly the monoidal equivalence of the category of \u039e-modules and the category of G-graded K-bimodules and use this to prove that different choices of R are related by Drinfeld cochain twists.

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION The Kitaev model1 for topologically fault-tolerant quantum computing is defined by the quantum double D(G) of a finite group G. The irreducible representations of this quantum group are quasiparticles corresponding to measurement outcomes at sites on a lattice, and their dynamics correspond to linear maps on the data. The lattice can be any ciliated ribbon graph embedded on a surface,2 although throughout we will assume a square lattice on the plane for convenience. The topological properties of the Kitaev model derive from the \u201ctopological order\u201d in condensed matter terms,3 which is the braided category Z(C) given by the \u201cdual\u201d or \u201ccentre\u201d construction\u20194 applied to the monoidal category C = MG of G-graded vector spaces. This is then identified with the category D(G)M of D(G)-modules for the explicit algebraic treatment. The Kitaev model generalises to replace G by a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra, as well as aspects that work of a general finitedimensional Hopf algebra. We refer to Ref. 5 for details of the relevant algebraic aspects of this theory, which applies in the bulk of the Kitaev model.\nIn the present sequel, we extend from the bulk theory to a detailed study of a certain quasi-Hopf algebra \u039e(R, K) that similarly governs the quasiparticle states on a boundary as its representations, as in Ref. 6. In physical terms, a gapped boundary of a Kitaev model preserves a finite energy gap between the vacuum and the lowest excited state(s), which is independent of system size. There are two equivalent views of gapped boundaries, as summarised in Ref. 7, Sec 3.2. The first is using a Lagrangian algebra L in D(G)M and then constructing functors D(G)M \u2192 L M to describe anyon condensation, with L M defining the boundary phase. One can also use Frobenius algebras and take idempotent completion of a relevant quotient category to acquire the boundary.6 In the second view, which is the one we take, boundary conditions are defined by module categories of the fusion category C. By definition, a (right) C-module means8,9 a category V equipped with a bifunctor V \u00d7 C\u2192 V obeying coherence equations which are a polarised version of the properties of\u2297 : C \u00d7 C\u2192 C (in the same way that a right module of an algebra obeys a polarised version of the axioms for the product). For our purposes, we care about indecomposable module categories, that is module categories which are not equivalent to a direct sum of other module categories. Excitations on the boundary with condition V are then given by functors F \u2208 End C(V) that commute with the C action,9 beyond the vacuum state which is the identity functor id V. More\nJ. Math. Phys. 64, 102203 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0127285 64, 102203-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n19 January 2024 00:40:35\nthan just the boundary conditions above, we care about these excitations, and so End C(V) is the category of interest. Finally, for the Kitaev model, indecomposable module categories for C = MG are classified by subgroups K \u2286 G and cocycles \u03b1 \u2208 H2(K,C\u00d7).10 We will stick to the trivial \u03b1 case here and just work with V = K MG, the G-graded K-modules where x \u2208 K itself has grade \u2223x\u2223 = x \u2208 G. Then the excitations are governed by objects of End C(V) \u2243 K MGK , the category of G-graded bimodules over K. This is a nontrivially monoidal category and by Tannaka\u2013Krein arguments11 one can expect a quasi-Hopf algebra \u039e(R, K) such that K MGK \u2243 \u039e(R,K)M, the modules of \u039e(R, K). Here R is a choice of transversal for K \u2286 G so that every element of G factorises uniquely as RK.\nThis categorical derivation of \u039e(R, K) is deferred to Sec. VI, while the quasi-Hopf algebra \u039e(R, K) itself and its concrete application to gapped boundaries is the main focus of the paper. The algebraic model provides a critical bridge between explicit on the nose formulae that would be needed in any concrete implementation and the abstract categorical picture, which is more qualitative being only defined up to isomorphisms, for example up to equivalence of categories. After recapping the algebraic model for the bulk in Sec. II as a warm up, we study the algebra \u039e(R, K) and its physical role for boundary lattice models in Sec. III. We provide in detail the construction of its irreducible representations, their associated projections and (Proposition 3.8) the induction-restriction multiplicities due to an algebra inclusion i : \u039e(R, K)\u21aa D(G). The latter amounts to formulae for the decomposition of bulk quasiparticles into quasiparticles on the boundary, in our case directly from the algebra and not relying on the abstract categorical arguments of Ref. 12. We also demonstrate that these formulae hold explicitly on the lattice. While much of this has been studied previously,6,13,14 we give detailed proofs of results which have not been formally proven before to the best of our knowledge. We also correct several inaccuracies found in the literature, including in statements given without proof.\nOn the applications side, Sec. IV develops the theory of lattice surgery for the Kitaev model, which to our knowledge is the first description of quantum code surgery which goes beyond stabiliser codes.15 We give the maps on logical data and find that they are precisely the morphisms of the Hopf algebras CG and C(G) on the same space. Interestingly, this leaves open the possibility that there could be a method of universal computation with Kitaev models which does not require anyons and can be performed wholly on the vacuum space, unlike the methods of e.g. Refs. 16 and 17 which use excited states. We leave the problem of determining lattice surgery\u2019s computational power to future work.\nSection V then covers the further structure of \u039e(R, K) as a quasi-Hopf algebra, in much more detail than we have found elsewhere and with proofs. The coproduct here is well-known, for example it can be found in an equivalent form in Refs. 18 and 19, but we include its proof for completeness in our conventions and without certain restrictions previously assumed on R. The \u201cstandard\u201d antipode in Theorem 5.8 appears to be less well-known but is identical (up to conventions) to the antipode of \u039e(R, K) as a Hopf quasigroup in Ref. 18, and appears under slightly more assumptions in Ref. 19. The interaction between the coproduct and the standard antipode, in Proposition 5.9, is particularly new and follows from the \u2217-quasi-Hopf algebra structure in Appendix C. The antipode of a quasi-Hopf algebra20 is not unique but the standard one comes closest to familiar formulae for ordinary Hopf algebras, up to certain conjugations. In physical terms, the coproduct and antipode define the tensor product and dualisation of representations, which in our case are the boundary quasiparticles. We also give an extended series of examples, including one related to the octonions.\nIn Sec. VI, we give the promised categorical equivalence K MGK \u2243 \u039e(R,K)M concretely, deriving the quasi-bialgebra structure of \u039e(R, K) precisely such that this works. Since the left hand side is independent of R, it should be that changing R changes \u039e(R, K) by a Drinfeld cochain twist and we find this cochain, as a main result of the section. This is important as Drinfeld twists do not change the category of modules up to equivalence, so many aspects of the physics do not depend on R. Twisting arguments then imply that we have an antipode more generally for any R. We also look at V = K MG as a module category for C = MG. It can be shown further that Z(\u039eM) \u2243 Z(MG) \u2243 D(G)M as braided monoidal categories,21 known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. At our algebraic level this means that D(\u039e) is Drinfeld cochain twist equivalent to D(G), using the double of a quasi-Hopf algebra.22 The algebra inclusion i : \u039e\u21aa D(G) is a part of this, but the full isomorphism here is beyond our scope, albeit given explicitly in Ref. 23 in the case where R \u2286 G is a subgroup and hence \u039e(R, K) an ordinary bicrossproduct Hopf algebra.\nSection VII provides some concluding remarks, including about generalisations of the boundary theory to models based on other Hopf algebras.7,24"

The Hopf algebra antipode is S(\u03b4gh) = \u03b4h\u22121g\u22121hh \u22121, and over C we have a Hopf \u2217-algebra with (\u03b4gh)\u2217 = \u03b4h\u22121ghh \u22121. There is also a quasitriangular structure which in subalgebra notation is\nR =\u2211 h\u2208G \u03b4h \u2297 h \u2208 D(G)\u2297D(G). (1)\nIf we want to be totally explicit we can build D(G) on either the vector space C(G)\u2297CG or on the vector space CG\u2297C(G). In fact the latter is more natural but we follow the conventions in Refs. 5 and 25 and use the former. Then one can say the above more explicitly as\n(\u03b4g \u2297 h)(\u03b4 f \u2297 k) = \u03b4g\u03b4h f h\u22121 \u2297 hk = \u03b4g,h f h\u22121\u03b4g \u2297 hk, S(\u03b4g \u2297 h) = \u03b4h\u22121g\u22121h \u2297 h \u22121\netc. for the operations on the underlying vector space. As a semidirect product, irreducible representations of D(G) are given by standard theory as labelled by pairs (C,\u03c0) consisting of an orbit under the action (i.e. by a conjugacy class C \u2282 G in this case) and an irrep \u03c0 of the isotropy subgroup, in our case\nGc0 = {n \u2208 G \u2223 nc0n\u22121 = c0}\nof a fixed element c0 \u2208 C, i.e. the centraliser CG(c0). The choice of c0 does not change the isotropy group up to isomorphism but does change how it sits inside G. We also fix data qc \u2208 G for each c \u2208 C such that c = qcc0q \u22121 c with qc0 = e and define from this a cocycle \u03b6c(h) = q\u22121hch\u22121 hqc as a map \u03b6 : C \u00d7G\u2192 Gc0 . The associated irreducible representation is then\nW C,\u03c0 = CC\u2297W\u03c0 , \u03b4g.(c\u2297w) = \u03b4g,cc\u2297w, h.(c\u2297w) = hch\u22121 \u2297 \u03b6c(h).w\nfor all w \u2208W\u03c0 , the carrier space of \u03c0. This constructs all irreps of D(G) and, over C, these are unitary in a Hopf \u2217-algebra sense if \u03c0 is unitary. Moreover, D(G) is semisimple and hence has a block decomposition D(G) \u2245 \u2295 C,\u03c0 End(W C,\u03c0) given by a complete orthogonal set of self-adjoint central idempotents\nP(C,\u03c0) = dim(W\u03c0) \u2223Gc0 \u2223 \u2211c\u2208 C \u2211 n\u2208Gc0 Tr\u03c0(n\u22121)\u03b4c \u2297 qcnq\u22121c . (2)\nWe refer to Ref. 5 for more details and proofs. Acting on a state, this will become a projection operator that determines if a quasiparticle of type C,\u03c0 is present. Chargeons are quasiparticles with C = {e} and \u03c0 an irrep of G, and fluxions are quasiparticles with C a conjugacy class and \u03c0 = 1, the trivial representation."

The Hilbert space H will be a tensor product of vector spaces with one copy of CG at each arrow in E. We have group elements for the basis of each copy. Next, to each adjacent pair of vertex v and face p we associate a site s = (v, p), or equivalently a line (the \u201ccilium\u201d) from p to v. We then define an action of CG and C(G) at each site by\nJ. Math.

Detection of a quasiparticle is via a projective measurement of the operator\u2211 C,\u03c0 p C,\u03c0P C,\u03c0 acting at each site on the lattice for distinct coefficients p C,\u03c0 \u2208 R. By definition, this is a process which yields the classical value p C,\u03c0 with a probability given by the likelihood of the state prior to the measurement being in the subspace in the image of P C,\u03c0 , and in so doing performs the corresponding action of the projector P C,\u03c0 at the site. The projector Pe,1 corresponds to the vacuum quasiparticle.\nIn computing terms, this system of measurements encodes a logical Hilbert subspace, which we will always take to be the vacuum space Hvac, within the larger physical Hilbert space given by the lattice; this subspace is dependent on the topology of the surface that the lattice is embedded in, but not the size of the lattice. For example, there is a convenient closed-form expression for the dimension of Hvac when \u03a3 occupies a closed, orientable surface.26 Computation can then be performed on states in the logical subspace in a fault-tolerant manner, with unwanted excitations constituting detectable errors.\nIn the interest of brevity, we forgo a detailed exposition of such measurements, ribbon operators and fault-tolerant quantum computation on the lattice. The interested reader can learn about these in e.g. Refs. 1, 5, 6, and 14. We do give a brief recap of ribbon operators, although without much rigour, as these will be useful later.\nDefinition 2.2. A ribbon \u03be is a strip of face width that connects two sites s0 = (v0, p0) and s1 = (v1, p1) on the lattice. A ribbon operator Fh,g\u03be acts on the vector spaces associated to the edges along the path of the ribbon, as shown in Fig. 1. We call this basis of ribbon operators labelled by h and g the group basis.\nFIG. 1. Example of a ribbon operator for a ribbon \u03be from s0 = (v0, p0) to s1 = (v1, p1).\nJ. Math.

The physical interpretation of ribbon operators is that they create, move and annihilate quasiparticles.\nLemma 2.5 (Ref. 1). Let s0, s1 be two sites on the lattice. The only operators in End(H) which change the states at these sites, and therefore create quasiparticles and change the distribution of measurement outcomes, but leave the state in vacuum elsewhere, are ribbon operators.\nThis lemma is somewhat hard to prove rigorously but a proof was sketched in Ref. 5. Next, there is an alternate basis for these ribbon operators in which the physical interpretation becomes more obvious. The quasiparticle basis has elements\nF\u2032 C ,\u03c0;u,v\u03be = \u2211 n\u2208Gc0\n\u03c0(n\u22121)jiFc,qcnq \u22121 d\n\u03be , (3)\nwhere C is a conjugacy class, \u03c0 is an irrep of the associated isotropy subgroup Gc0 and u = (c, i), v = (d, j) label basis elements of W C,\u03c0 in which c, d \u2208 C and i, j label a basis of W\u03c0 . This amounts to a nonabelian Fourier transform of the space of ribbons [that is, the Peter\u2013Weyl isomorphism of D(G)] and has inverse\nFh,g\u03be = \u2211 C,\u03c0\u2208G\u0302c0 \u2211 c\u2208 C \u03b4h,gcg\u22121 dim(W\u03c0) \u2211 i,j=0 \u03c0(q\u22121gcg\u22121 gqc)ijF \u2032 C ,\u03c0;a,b \u03be , (4)\nwhere a = (gcg\u22121, i) and b = (c, j). This reduces in the chargeon sector to the special cases\nF\u2032e,\u03c0;i, j\u03be =\u2211 n\u2208G \u03c0(n\u22121)jiFe,n\u03be (5)\nand\nFe,g\u03be =\u2211 \u03c0\u2208G\u0302 dim(W\u03c0) \u2211 i,j=0 \u03c0(g)ijF\u2032e,\u03c0;i, j\u03be (6)\nJ.

This is because the chargeon sector corresponds to the irreps of CG, itself a semisimple algebra; the fluxion sector has no such correspondence.\nIf G is Abelian then \u03c0 are 1-dimensional and we do not have to worry about the indices for the basis of W\u03c0 ; this then looks like a more usual Fourier transform.\nLemma 2.6. If \u03be\u2032 is a ribbon concatenated with \u03be, then the associated ribbon operators in the quasiparticle basis satisfy\nF\u2032 C,\u03c0;u,v\u03be\u2032\u25cb\u03be =\u2211 w F\u2032 C,\u03c0;w,v\u03be\u2032 \u25cb F \u2032 C ,\u03c0;u,w \u03be\nand are such that the nonabelian Fourier transform takes convolution to multiplication and vice versa, as it does in the abelian case.\nIn particular, we have the ribbon trace operators, W C ,\u03c0\u03be \u2236= \u2211u F \u2032 C ,\u03c0;u,u \u03be . Such ribbon trace operators create exactly quasiparticles of the type\nC,\u03c0 from the vacuum, meaning that P(C,\u03c0)\u25b9s0 W C ,\u03c0\u03be \u2223vac\u27e9 =W C ,\u03c0 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9 =W C ,\u03c0 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9\u25c3s1 P(C,\u03c0).\nWe refer to Ref. 5 for more details and proofs of the above.\nExample 2.7. Our go-to example for our expositions will be G = S3 generated by transpositions u = (12), v = (23) with w = (13) = uvu = vuv. There are then 8 irreducible representations of D(S3) according to the choices C0 = {e}, C1 = {u, v,w}, C2 = {uv, vu} for which we pick representatives c0 = e, qe = e, c1 = u, qu = e, qv = w, qw = v and c2 = uv with quv = e, qvu = v (with the ci in the role of c0 in the general theory). Here Gc0 = S3 with three representations \u03c0 = trivial, sign and W2 the two-dimensional one given by (say) \u03c0(u) = \u03c33, \u03c0(v) = ( \u221a 3\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c33)/2, Gc1 = {e, u} = Z2 with \u03c0(u) = \u00b11 and Gc2 = {e, uv, vu} = Z3 with \u03c0(uv) = 1,\u03c9,\u03c92 for \u03c9 = e 2\u03c0\u0131 3 .

It is not necessary in this section, but convenient, to fix a representative r for each coset and let R \u2286 G be the set of these, so there is a bijection between R and G/K whereby r\u2194 rK. We assume that e \u2208 R and call such a subset (or section of the map G\u2192 G/K) a transversal. Every element of G factorises uniquely as rx for r \u2208 R and x \u2208 K, giving a coordinatisation of G which we will use. Next, as we quotiented by K from the right, we still have an action of K from the left on G/K, which we denote \u22b3. By the above bijection, this equivalently means an action \u22b3 : K \u00d7 R\u2192 R on R which in terms of the factorisation is determined by xry = (x \u22b3 r)y\u2032, where we refactorise xry in the form RK for some y\u2032 \u2208 R. There is much more information in this factorisation, as will see in Sec. V, but this action is all we need for now. Also note that we have chosen to work with left cosets so as to be consistent with the literature,6,13 but one could equally choose a right coset factorisation to build a class of algebras similar to those in Ref. 18. We consider the algebraC(G/K)>\u25c3CK as the cross product by the above action. Using our coordinatisation, this becomes the following algebra.\nDefinition 3.1. \u039e(R, K) = C(R)>\u25c3CK is generated by C(R) and CK with cross relations x\u03b4r = \u03b4x\u22b3rx.

Irreps of \u039e(R, K) are classified by pairs (O, \u03c1) where O \u2286 R is an orbit under the action \u22b3 and \u03c1 is an irrep of the isotropy group Kr0 \u2236= {x \u2208 K \u2223 x\u25b9r0 = r0}. Here we fix a base point r0 \u2208 O as well as \u03ba : O\u2192 K a choice of lift such that\n\u03bar \u25b9 r0 = r, \u2200r \u2208 O, \u03bar0 = e.\nThen VO,\u03c1 = CO\u2297 V\u03c1, \u03b4r(s\u2297 v) = \u03b4r,ss\u2297 v, x.(s\u2297 v) = x \u25b9 s\u2297 \u03b6s(x).v\nfor v \u2208 V\u03c1, the carrier space for \u03c1, and \u03b6 : O \u00d7 K \u2192 Kr0 , \u03b6r(x) = \u03ba\u22121x\u25b9rx\u03bar.\nProof. One can check that \u03b6r(x) lives in Kr0 ,\n\u03b6r(x) \u25b9 r0 = (\u03ba\u22121x\u25b9rx\u03bar) \u25b9 r0 = \u03ba\u22121x\u25b9r \u25b9 (x \u25b9 r) = \u03ba\u22121x\u25b9r \u25b9 (\u03bax\u25b9r \u25b9 r0) = r0\nand the cocycle property\n\u03b6r(xy) = \u03ba\u22121x\u25b9y\u25b9rx\u03bay\u25b9r\u03ba\u22121y\u25b9ry\u03bar = \u03b6y\u25b9r(x)\u03b6r(y),\nfrom which it is easy to see that VO,\u03c1 is a representation,\nx.(y.(s\u2297 v)) = x.(y \u25b9 s\u2297 \u03b6s(y).v) = x \u25b9 (y \u25b9 s)\u2297 \u03b6y\u25b9s(x)\u03b6s(y).v = xy \u25b9 s\u2297 \u03b6s(xy).v = (xy).(s\u2297 v),\nx.(\u03b4r.(s\u2297 v)) = \u03b4r,sx \u25b9 s\u2297 \u03b6s(x).v = \u03b4x\u25b9r,x\u25b9sx \u25b9 s\u2297 \u03b6s(x).v = \u03b4x\u25b9r.(x.(s\u2297 v)).\nThat VO,\u03c0 is irreducible is by similar arguments to the construction of irreps of semidirect products groups (such as the Poincar\u00e9 group), but we provide a short proof directly for our case. Indeed, suppose that W \u2286 VO,\u03c1 is a non-zero subrepresentation under \u039e(R, K). Then W has the form W = \u2295s \u2208Os\u2297Ws for some subspaces Ws \u2286 V\u03c1 and we show that Ws = V\u03c1 for all s so that W = VO,\u03c1. Let 0 \u2260 w = \u2211t \u2208O t \u2297 vt \u2208W with at least one component say vt \u2260 0 for some t. Let t = y\u22121 \u22b3 s for some y \u2208 K, since O is a single orbit, then y\u03b4t .w = y.(t \u2297 vt) = s\u2297 \u03b6 t(y).vt = s\u2297 v \u2208W since W is closed under the action of \u039e(R, K), for some element v = \u03b6 t(y).vt \u2208Ws which is nonzero since \u03b6t(y) \u2208 Kr0 is a group element (so its action on vt is invertible). Now consider the set\n\u03basCKr0\u03ba\u22121s .(s\u2297 v) = s\u2297CKr0.v \u2286 s\u2297Ws \u2286 s\u2297 V\u03c1\nsince \u03basx\u03ba\u22121s \u25b9 s = \u03basx\u25b9r0 = \u03bas \u25b9 r0 = s for all x \u2208 Kr0 and W is closed under the action of \u039e(R, K). Here, \u03bas( )\u03ba\u22121s is a bijection between Kr0 and the isotropy group Ks at s. Now CKr0.v \u2286 V\u03c1 is a nonzero representation of Kr0 since we can act further from the left by Kr0 , and hence equal to V\u03c1 as the latter is irreducible. It follows that Ws = V\u03c1 also since this was in between the two spaces. One can further show that the stated construction does not depend up to isomorphism on the choice of r0 or \u03bar . \u25fb\nIn the \u2217-algebra case as here, we obtain a unitary representation if \u03c1 is unitary. One can also show that all irreps can be obtained this way. In fact the algebra \u039e(R, K) is semisimple and has a block associated to the VO,\u03c0 .\nLemma 3.4. \u039e(R, K) has a complete orthogonal set of central idempotents\nP(O,\u03c1) = dim V\u03c1 \u2223Kr0 \u2223 \u2211r\u2208O \u2211 n\u2208Kr0 Tr\u03c1(n\u22121)\u03b4r \u2297 \u03barn\u03ba\u22121r .\nJ.

In the previous literature, the irreps have been described using double cosets and representatives thereof.6 In fact a double coset in K GK is an orbit for the left action of K on G/K and hence has the form OK corresponding to an orbit O \u2282 R in our approach. We will say more about this later, in Proposition 6.3.\nAn important question for the physics is how representations on the bulk relate to those on the boundary. This is afforded by functors in the two directions. Here we give a direct approach to this issue as follows.\nProposition 3.6. There is an inclusion of algebras i : \u039e(R, K)\u21aa D(G)\ni(x) = x, i(\u03b4r) =\u2211 x\u2208K \u03b4rx.\nThe pull-back or restriction of a D(G)-module W to a \u039e-module i\u2217(W) is simply for \u03be \u2208 \u039e to act by i(\u03be). Going the other way, the induction functor sends a \u039e-module V to a D(G)-module D(G)\u2297\u039e V, where \u03be \u2208 \u039e right acts on D(G) by right multiplication by i(\u03be). These two functors are adjoint.\nProof. We just need to check that i respects the relations of \u039e. Thus,\ni(\u03b4r)i(\u03b4s) = \u2211 x,y\u2208K \u03b4rx\u03b4sy =\u2211 x\u2208K \u03b4r,s\u03b4rx = i(\u03b4r\u03b4s),\ni(x)i(\u03b4r) =\u2211 y\u2208K x\u03b4ry =\u2211 y\u2208K \u03b4xryx\u22121 x =\u2211 y\u2208K \u03b4(x\u25b9r)x\u2032yx\u22121 x = \u2211 y\u2032\u2208K \u03b4(x\u25b9r)y\u2032x = i(\u03b4x\u25b9rx),\nas required. For the first line, we used the unique factorisation G = RK to break down the \u03b4-functions. For the second line, we use this in the form xr = (x \u22b3 r)x\u2032 for some x\u2032 \u2208 K and then changed variables from y to y\u2032 = x\u2032yx\u22121. The rest follows as for any algebra inclusion. \u25fb\nIn fact, \u039e is a quasi-bialgebra and at least when ( )R is bijective a quasi-Hopf algebra, as we see in Sec. V. In the latter case, it has a quantum double D(\u039e) which contains \u039e as a sub-quasi Hopf algebra. Moreover, it can be shown that D(\u039e) is a \u201cDrinfeld cochain twist\u201d of D(G), which implies it has the same algebra as D(G). This is the algebraic level of the bulk-boundary correspondence.21 We do not need the full isomorphism here, which is beyond our scope since the double of a quasi-Hopf algebra22 is itself quite complicated to describe explicitly, but this is the abstract reason for the above inclusion. (An explicit proof of this twisting result in the usual Hopf algebra case with R a group is in Ref. 23.) Meanwhile, the statement that the two functors in the lemma are adjoint is that\nhomD(G) (D(G)\u2297 \u039e\nV , W)) = hom\u039e(V , i\u2217(W))\nfor all \u039e-modules V and all D(G)-modules W. These functors do not take irreps to irreps and of particular interest are the multiplicities for the decompositions back into irreps, i.e. if V i, Wa are respective irreps and D(G)\u2297\u039eVi = \u2295aniaWa then\nJ. Math.

It remains to give a formula for these multiplicities; here we were not able to reproduce the formulae of Refs. 6, Theorem 2.12 and 27, Theorem 2.12 which were stated without proof and referenced back to Ref. 12. Instead, our approach goes via a general lemma. First, recall that a linear map \u222b : B\u2192 C is Frobenius if the bilinear form (b, c) \u2236= \u222b bc is nondegenerate, and is symmetric if this bilinear form is symmetric. Also, let g = g1 \u2297 g2 \u2208 B\u2297 B (in a notation with the sum of such terms understood) be the associated \u201cmetric\u201d such that (\u222b bg1)g2 = b = g1\u222b g2b for all b (it is the inverse matrix in a basis of the algebra). We say that the Frobenius form is special if the algebra product \u22c5 obeys \u22c5(g) = 1. It is well-known that there is a unique symmetric special Frobenius form up to scale, given by the trace in the left regular representation, see Ref. 28 for a recent study.\nLemma 3.7. Let i : A\u21aa B be an inclusion of finite-dimensional semisimple algebras and \u222b the unique symmetric special Frobenius linear form on B such that \u222b 1 = 1. Let V i be an irrep of A and Wa an irrep of B. Then the multiplicity V i in the pull-back i\u2217(Wa) (which is the same as the multiplicity of Wa in B\u2297A V i) is given by\nnia = dim(B)\ndim(Vi)dim(Wa) \u222b i(Pi)Pa,\nwhere Pi \u2208 A and Pa \u2208 B are the associated central idempotents. Moreover, i(Pi)Pa = 0 if and only if nia = 0.\nProof. In our case, overC, we know that a finite-dimensional semisimple algebra B is a direct sum of matrix algebras End(Wa) associated to the irreps Wa of B. Then\n\u222b i(Pi)Pa = 1\ndim(B)\u2211\u03b1,\u03b2 \u27e8 f \u03b1 \u2297 e\u03b2, i(Pi)Pa(e\u03b1 \u2297 f \u03b2)\u27e9\n= 1 dim(B)\u2211\u03b1 dim(Wa)\u27e8 f \u03b1, i(Pi)e\u03b1\u27e9 = dim(Wa)dim(Vi) dim(B) n i a.\nwhere {e\u03b1} is a basis of Wa and { f \u03b2} is a dual basis, and Pa acts as the identity on End(Wa) and zero on the other blocks. We then used that if i\u2217(Wa) = \u2295iniaVi as A-modules, then i(Pi) just picks out the V i components where Pi acts as the identity.\nFor the last part, the forward direction is immediate given the first part of the lemma. For the other direction, suppose nia = 0 so that i\u2217(Wa) = \u2295 jn jaV j with j \u2260 a running over the other irreps of A. Now, we can view Pa \u2208Wa \u2297W\u2217a (as the identity element) and left multiplication by i(Pi) is the same as Pi acting on Pa viewed as an element of i\u2217(Wa)\u2297W\u2217a , which is therefore zero. \u25fb\nWe apply Lemma 3.7 in our case of A = \u039e and B = D(G), where\ndim(Vi) = \u2223O\u2223dim(V\u03c1), dim(Wa) = \u2223C\u2223dim(W\u03c0)\nwith i = (C, \u03c1) as described above and a = (C,\u03c0) as described in Sec.

Example 3.9. (i) We take G = S3, K = {e, u} = Z2, where u = (12). Here G/K consists of\nG/K = {{e, u},{w, uv},{v, vu}}\nand our standard choice of R will be R = {e, uv, vu}, where we take one from each coset (but any other transversal will have the same irreps and their decompositions). This leads to three irreps of \u039e(R, K) as follows. In R, we have two orbits O0 = {e}, O1 = {uv, vu} and we choose representatives r0 = e, \u03bae = e, r1 = uv, \u03bauv = e, \u03bavu = u since u \u22b3 (uv) = vu for the two cases (here r1 was denoted r0 in the general theory and is the choice for O1). We also have u \u22b3 (vu) = uv. Note that it happens that these orbits are also conjugacy classes but this is an accident of S3 and not true for S4. We have Kr0 = K = Z2 with representations \u03c1(u) = \u00b11 and Kr1 = {e} with only the trivial representation.\n(ii) For D(S3), we have the eight irreps in Example 2.7 and hence there is a 3 \u00d7 8 table of the {nia}. We can easily compute some of the special cases from the above. For example, the trivial \u03c0 restricted to K is \u03c1 = 1, the sign representation restricted to K is the \u03c1 = \u22121 representation, the W2 restricted to K is 1\u2295 \u22121, which gives the upper left 2 \u00d7 3 submatrix for the chargeon sector. Another six entries (four new ones) are given from the fluxion formula. We also have C2 \u2229 K = \u2205 so that the latter part of the first two rows is zero by our first special case formula. For C1,\u00b11 in the first row, we have C1 \u2229 K = {u} with trivial action of K, so just one orbit. This gives us a nontrivial result in the +1 case and 0 in the \u22121 case. The story for C1,\u00b11 in the second row follows the same derivation, but needs \u03c4 = \u22121 and hence \u03c0 = \u22121 for the nonzero case. In the third row with C2,\u03c0, we have Kr = {e} so G\u2032 = {e} and we only have \u03c4 = 1 = \u03c1 as well as \u03c0\u0303 = 1 independently of \u03c0 as this is 1-dimensional. So both n factors in the formula in Proposition 3.8 are 1. In the sum over r, c, we need c = r so we sum over two possibilities, giving a nontrivial result as shown. For C1,\u03c0, the first part goes the same way and we similarly have c determined from r in the case of C1,\u03c0, so again two contributions in the sum, giving the answer shown independently of \u03c0. Finally, for C0,\u03c0 we have r = {uv, vu} and c = e, and can never meet the condition r\u22121c \u2208 K. So these all have 0. Thus, Proposition 3.8 in this example tells us:\nOne can check for consistency that for each Wa, dim(Wa) is the sum of the dimensions of the V i that it contains, which determines one row from the other two."

There is a site s0 indicated at the boundary.\nThere is an action of CK at the boundary vertex associated to s0, identical to the action of CK defined above but with the left edge undefined. Similarly, there is an action of C(R) at the face associated to s0. However, this is more complicated, as the face has three edges undefined and the action must be defined slightly differently from in the bulk:\nwhere the action is given a superscript \u22b3b to differentiate it from the actions in the bulk. In the first case, we follow the same clockwise rotation rule but skip over the undefined values on the grey edges, but for the second case we go round anticlockwise. The resulting rule is then according to whether the cilium is associated to the top or bottom of the edge. It is easy to check that this defines a representation of \u039e(R, K) on H associated to each smooth boundary site, such as s0, and that the actions of C(R) have been chosen such that this holds. A similar principle holds for \u22b3b in other orientations of the boundary.\nThe integral actions at a boundary vertex v and at a face s0 = (v, p) of a smooth boundary are then\nAb1(v) \u2236= \u039bCK\u25b9bv = 1 \u2223K\u2223\u2211k k\u25b9bv , Bb1(p) \u2236= \u039bC(R)\u25b9bp = \u03b4e\u25b9bp,\nwhere the superscript b and subscript 1 label that these are at a smooth boundary.

In Ref. 13 it is claimed that one can similarly introduce actions at smooth boundaries defined not only by R and K but also a two-cocycle \u03b1. This makes some sense categorically, as the module categories of MG may also include such a two-cocycle, which enters by way of a twisted group algebra C\u03b1K.10 However, in Fig. 6 of Ref. 13 one can see that when the cocycle \u03b1 is introduced all edges on the boundary are assumed to be copies of CK, rather than CG. On closer inspection, it is evident that this means that the action on faces of \u03b4e \u2208 C(R) will always yield 1, and the action of any other basis element of C(R) will yield 0. Similarly, the action on vertices is defined to still be an action of CK, not C\u03b1K. Thus, the excitations on this boundary are restricted to only the representations of CK, without either C(R) or \u03b1 appearing, which appears to defeat the purpose of the definition. It is not obvious to us that a cocycle can be included along these lines in a consistent manner. There are Hamiltonian models which use \u201ctube algebras\u201d to include cocycles,30 but it is unclear how these could be incorporated into a system of measurements defining a quantum computer.\nIn quantum computational terms, in addition to the measurements in the bulk we now measure the operator \u2211O,\u03c1 pO,\u03c1P(O,\u03c1)\u25b9b for distinct coefficients pO,\u03c1 \u2208 R at all sites along the boundary."

The second action goes counterclockwise in order to have an associated representation of \u039e(R, K) at the bottom left. We have similar actions for other orientations of the lattice.\nRemark 3.12. Although one can check that one has a representation of \u039e(R, K) at each site using these actions and the action of CK defined before, this requires g1 and g2 on opposite sides of the \u03b4-function, and g1 and g3 on opposite sides, respectively for the last two actions. This means that there is no way to get \u03b4e \u22b3 b to always be invariant under choice of site in the face. It is implicitly claimed in Ref. 6, Remark 2.9 that \u03b4e \u22b3 b at a rough boundary can be defined in a way that depends only on the face, but this is not the case.\nThe integral actions at a boundary vertex v and at a site s0 = (v, p) of a rough boundary are then\nAb2(v) \u2236= \u039bCK\u25b9bv = 1 \u2223K\u2223\u2211k k\u25b9bv , Bb2(v, p) \u2236= \u039bC(R)\u25b9bs0 = \u03b4e\u25b9 b s0\nwhere the superscript b and subscript 2 label that these are at a rough boundary.

In particular, we do not have Bb2(v, p)A(v) = A(v)Bb2(v, p) in general; this means that the model is not a commuting projector model. When the action at v is restricted to CK we recover an action of \u039e(R, K) again. Similarly, if K = {e}, as we will use in Sec. IV later, then the projectors commute and we recover a consistent definition of the vacuum in terms of projectors.\nAs with the bulk, the Hamiltonian incorporating the boundaries uses the actions of the integrals. We can accommodate both rough and smooth boundaries into the Hamiltonian. Let V , P be the set of vertices and faces in the bulk, S1 the set of all sites (v, p) at smooth boundaries, and S2 the same for rough boundaries.

This set of quasiparticles on the boundary will not in general be the same as quasiparticles defined in the bulk, as \u039e(R,K)M \u2243/ D(G)M for all nontrivial G.\nQuasiparticles in the bulk can be created from a vacuum and moved using ribbon operators,1 where the ribbon operators are seen as left and right module maps D(G)\u2217 \u2192 End(H), see Ref. 5. Following Ref. 6, we could similarly define a different set of ribbon operators for the boundary excitations, which use \u039e(R, K)\u2217 rather than D(G)\u2217. However, these have limited utility. For completeness we cover them in Appendix A. Instead, for our purposes we will keep using the normal ribbon operators.\nSuch normal ribbon operators can extend to boundaries, still using Definition 2.2, so long as none of the edges involved in the definition are greyed-out. When a ribbon operator ends at a boundary site s, we are not concerned with equivariance with respect to the actions of\nJ. Math.

Instead we should calculate equivariance with respect to the actions of C(R) and CK. We will study the matter in more depth in Sec. V, but note that if s, t \u2208 R then unique factorisation means that st = (s \u22c5 t)\u03c4(s, t) for unique elements s \u22c5 t \u2208 R and \u03c4(s, t) \u2208 K. Similarly, if y \u2208 K and r \u2208 R then unique factorisation yr = (y \u22b3 r)(y \u22b2 r) defines y \u22b2 r to be studied later.\nLemma 3.14. Let \u03be be an open ribbon from s0 to s1, where s0 is located at a smooth boundary, for example:\nand where \u03be begins at the specified orientation in the example, leading from s0 into the bulk, rather than running along the boundary. Then\nx\u25b9bs0 \u25cb F h,g \u03be = F xhx\u22121 ,xg \u03be \u25cb x\u25b9 b s0 ; \u03b4r\u25b9 b s0 \u25cb F h,g \u03be = F h,g \u03be \u25cb \u03b4s\u22c5(y\u25b9r)\u25b9 b s0\n\u2200x \u2208 K, r \u2208 R, h, g \u2208 G, and where sy is the unique factorisation of h\u22121.\nProof. The first is just the vertex action of CG restricted to CK, with an edge greyed-out which does not influence the result. For the second, expand \u03b4r\u25b9bs0 and verify explicitly:\nJ. Math. Phys. 64, 102203 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0127285 64, 102203-15\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n19 January 2024 00:40:35\nwhere we see (s \u22c5 (y \u22b3 r))K = s(y \u22b3 r)\u03c4(s, y \u22b3 r)\u22121K = s(y \u22b3 r)K = s(y \u22b3 r)(y \u22b2 r)K = syrK = h\u22121rK. We check the other site as well:\n\u25fb\nRemark 3.15. One might be surprised that the equivariance property holds for the latter case when s0 is attached to the vertex at the bottom of the face, as in this case \u03b4r\u25b9bs0 confers a \u03b4-function in the counterclockwise direction, different from the bulk. This is because the well-known equivariance properties in the bulk1 are not wholly correct, depending on orientation, as pointed out in Ref. 32, Sec. 3.3. We accommodated for this by specifying an orientation in Lemma 2.4.\nRemark 3.16. We have a similar situation for a rough boundary, albeit we found only one orientation for which the same equivariance property holds, which is:\nIn the reverse orientiation, where the ribbon crosses downwards instead, equivariance is similar but with the introduction of an antipode. For other orientations we do not find an equivariance property at all. We do not know of a physical interpretation for this oddity.\nAs with the bulk, we can define an excitation space using a ribbon between the two endpoints s0, s1, although more care must be taken in the definition.\nJ.

Let \u2223vac\u27e9 be a vacuum state on a half-plane \u03a3, where there is one smooth boundary beyond which there are no more edges. Let \u03be be a ribbon between two endpoints s0, s1 where s0 = {v0, p0} is on the boundary and s1 = {v1, p1} is in the bulk, such that \u03be interacts with the boundary only once, when crossing from s0 into the bulk; it cannot cross back and forth multiple times. Let \u2223\u03c8h,g\u27e9 \u2236= Fh,g\u03be \u2223vac\u27e9, and T \u03be(s0, s1) be the space with basis \u2223\u03c8h,g\u27e9.\n(1) \u2223\u03c8h,g\u27e9 is independent of the choice of ribbon through the bulk between fixed sites s0, s1, so long as the ribbon still only interacts with the boundary at the chosen location. (2) T \u03be(s0, s1) \u2282 H inherits actions at disjoint sites s0, s1,\nx\u25b9bs0 \u2223\u03c8 h,g\u27e9 = \u2223\u03c8xhx \u22121 ,xg\u27e9, \u03b4r\u25b9bs0 \u2223\u03c8 h,g\u27e9 = \u03b4rK,hK \u2223\u03c8h,g\u27e9\nf \u25b9s1 \u2223\u03c8h,g\u27e9 = \u2223\u03c8h,g f \u22121 \u27e9, \u03b4 f \u25b9s1 \u2223\u03c8h,g\u27e9 = \u03b4 f ,g\u22121h\u22121g \u2223\u03c8 h,g\u27e9\nwhere we use the module isomorphism \u2223\u03c8h,g\u27e9\u21a6 \u03b4hg to see the action at s0 as a representation of \u039e(R, K) on D(G). In particular it is the restriction of the left regular representation of D(G) to \u039e(R, K), with inclusion map i from Lemma 3.6. The action at s1 is the right regular representation of D(G), as in the bulk.\nProof. (1) is the same as the proof in Ref. 5, Proposition3.10, with the exception that if the ribbon \u03be\u2032 crosses the boundary multiple times it will incur an additional energy penalty from the Hamiltonian for each crossing, and thus T \u03be\u2032(s0, s1) \u2260 T \u03be(s0, s1) in general.\n(2) This follows by the commutation rules in Lemmas 3.14 and 2.4 respectively, using\nx\u25b9bs0 \u2223vac\u27e9 = \u03b4e\u25b9 b s0 \u2223vac\u27e9 = \u2223vac\u27e9; f \u25b9s1 \u2223vac\u27e9 = \u03b4e\u25b9s1 \u2223vac\u27e9 = \u2223vac\u27e9\n\u2200x \u2208 K, f \u2208 G. For the hardest case we have\n\u03b4r\u25b9bs0 F h,g \u2223vac\u27e9 = Fh,g\u03be \u25cb \u03b4s\u22c5(y\u25b9r)\u25b9 b s0 \u2223vac\u27e9\n= Fh,g\u03be \u03b4s\u22c5(y\u25b9r)K,K \u2223vac\u27e9\n= Fh,g\u03be \u03b4rK,hK \u2223vac\u27e9.\nFor the restriction of the action at s0 to \u039e(R, K), we have that\n\u03b4r \u22c5 \u03b4hg = \u03b4rK,hK\u03b4hg = \u2211 a\u2208rK \u03b4a,h\u03b4hg = i(\u03b4r)\u03b4hg.\nand x \u22c5 \u03b4h g = x\u03b4h g = i(x)\u03b4h g. \u25fb\nIn the bulk, the excitation space L(s0, s1) is totally independent of the ribbon \u03be,1,5 but we do not know of a similar property for T \u03be(s0, s1) when interacting with the boundary without the restrictions stated.\nWe explained in Sec. III A how representations of D(G) at sites in the bulk relate to those of \u039e(R, K) in the boundary by functors in both directions. Physically, if we apply ribbon trace operators, that is operators of the form W C ,\u03c0\u03be , to the vacuum, then in the bulk we create exactly a quasiparticle of type (C,\u03c0) and (C\u2217,\u03c0\u2217) at either end. Now let us include a boundary.\nDefinition 3.18. Given an irrep of D(G) provided by (C,\u03c0), we define the boundary projection Pi\u2217(C,\u03c0) \u2208 \u039e(R, K) by\nPi\u2217(C,\u03c0) = \u2211 (O,\u03c1) \u2223 n(O ,\u03c1)(C ,\u03c0) \u22600 P(O,\u03c1)\ni.e. we sum over the projectors of all the types of irreps of \u039e(R, K) contained in the restriction of the given D(G) irrep.\nIt is clear that Pi\u2217(C,\u03c0) is a projection as a sum of orthogonal projections.\nProposition 3.19. Let \u03be be an open ribbon extending from an external site s0 on a smooth boundary with associated algebra \u039e(R, K) to a site s1 in the bulk, for example:\nJ. Math. Phys. 64, 102203 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0127285 64, 102203-17\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n19 January 2024 00:40:35\nThen\nP(O,\u03c1)\u25b9bs0 W C ,\u03c0 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9 = 0 iff n (O ,\u03c1) (C ,\u03c0) = 0.\nIn addition, we have\nPi\u2217(C,\u03c0)\u25b9 b s0 W C ,\u03c0 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9 =W C ,\u03c0 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9 =W C ,\u03c0 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9\u25c3s1 P(C,\u03c0),\nwhere we see the left action at s1 of P(C\u2217 ,\u03c0\u2217) as a right action using the antipode.\nProof. Under the isomorphism in Lemma 3.17 we have that W C ,\u03c0\u03be \u2223vac\u27e9\u21a6 P(C,\u03c0) \u2208 D(G). For the first part we therefore have\nP(O,\u03c1)\u25b9bs0 W C ,\u03c0 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9\u21a6 i(P(O,\u03c1))P(C,\u03c0)\nso the result follows from the last part of Lemma 3.7. Since the sum of projectors over the irreps of \u039e is 1, this then implies the second part:\nW C ,\u03c0\u03be \u2223vac\u27e9 =\u2211 O,\u03c1 P(O,\u03c1)\u25b9bs0 W C ,\u03c0 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9 = Pi\u2217(C,\u03c0)\u25b9 b s0 W C ,\u03c0 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9.\nThe action at s1 is the same as for bulk ribbon operators. \u25fb\nThe physical interpretation is that application of a ribbon trace operator W C ,\u03c0\u03be to a vacuum state creates a quasiparticle at s0 of all the types contained in i\u2217(C,\u03c0), while still creating one of type (C\u2217,\u03c0\u2217) at s1; this is called the condensation of (C,\u03c0) at the boundary. While we used a smooth boundary in this example, the proposition applies equally to rough boundaries with the specified orientation in Remark 3.16 by similar arguments.\nNote that by Proposition 3.19, it does not make sense to have irreps with multiplicities greater than 1 \u201cliving\u201d at a site. Thus, if one were to take the purely categorical model and map irreps from D(G)M to \u039e(R,K)M this would yield unphysical representations at the boundary; one must then truncate all multiplicities to 1. In Ref. 27 this feature of the model is called having multiple condensation channels.\nExample 3.20. In the bulk, we take the D(S3)model. Then by Example 2.7, we have exactly eight irreps in the bulk. At the boundary, we take K = {e, u} = Z2 with R = {e, uv, vu}. As per the table in Example 3.9 and Proposition 3.19 above, we then have for example that\n(PO0 ,\u22121 + PO1 ,1)\u25b9 b s0 W C1 ,\u22121 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9 =W C1 ,\u22121 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9 =W C1 ,\u22121 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9\u25c3s1 P C1 ,\u22121.\nWe can see this explicitly. Recall that\n\u039bC(R)\u25b9bs0 \u2223vac\u27e9 = \u039bCK\u25b9 b s0 \u2223vac\u27e9 = \u2223vac\u27e9.\nJ. Math.

Second,\nPO1 ,1\u25b9 b s0 W C1 ,\u22121 \u03be \u2223vac\u27e9 = ((\u03b4uv + \u03b4vu)\u2297 e)\u25b9 b s0 \u2211 c\u2208{u,v,w} (Fc,e\u03be \u2212 F c,c \u03be )\u2223vac\u27e9\n= (Fv,e\u03be \u2212 F v,v \u03be + F w,e \u03be \u2212 F w,w \u03be )(\u03b4e \u2297 e)\u25b9 b s0 \u2223vac\u27e9 = (Fv,e\u03be \u2212 F v,v \u03be + F w,e \u03be \u2212 F w,w \u03be )\u2223vac\u27e9.\nThe result follows immediately. All other boundary projections of D(S3) ribbon trace operators can be worked out in a similar way.\nRemark 3.21. Proposition 3.19 does not tell us exactly how all ribbon operators in the quasiparticle basis are detected at the boundary, only the ribbon trace operators. A similar general formula for all ribbon operators is given in Ref. 27, Theorem 2.12 without proof.\nNow, consider a lattice in the plane with two boundaries, namely to the left and right,\nRecall that a lattice on an infinite plane admits a single ground state \u2223vac\u27e9 as explained in Ref. 5. However, in the present case, we may be able to also use ribbon operators in the quasiparticle basis extending from one boundary, at s0 say, to the other, at s1 say, such that no quasiparticles are detected at either end. These ribbon operators do not form a closed, contractible loop, as all undetectable ones do in the\nJ. Math.

We can similarly induce additional degeneracy of excited states. This justifies the term gapped boundaries, as the boundaries give rise to additional states with energies that are \u201cgapped;\u201d that is, they have a finite energy difference \u0394 (which may be zero) independently of the width of the lattice."

            "text": "For any nontrivial group, G there are always at least two distinct choices of boundary conditions, namely with K = {e} and K = G respectively. In these cases, we necessarily have R = G and R = {e} respectively. Considering K = {e} on a smooth boundary, we can calculate that Ab1(v) = id and Bb1(s)g = \u03b4e,gg, for g an element corresponding to the single edge associated with the boundary site s. This means that after performing the measurements at a boundary, these edges are totally constrained and not part of the large entangled state incorporating the rest of the lattice, and hence do not contribute to the model whatsoever. If we remove these edges then we are left with a rough boundary, in which all edges participate, and therefore we may consider the K = {e} case to imply a rough boundary. A similar argument applies for K = G when considered on a rough boundary, which has Ab2(v)g = A(v)g = 1\u2223G\u2223\u2211k kg = 1 \u2223G\u2223\u2211k k for an edge with state g and B b 2(s) = id. K = G therefore naturally corresponds instead to a smooth boundary, as otherwise the outer edges are totally constrained by the projectors. From now on, we will accordingly use smooth to refer always to the K = G condition, and rough for K = {e}.\nThese boundary conditions are convenient because the condensation of bulk excitations to the vacuum at a boundary can be partially worked out in the group basis. For K = {e}, it is easy to see that the ribbon operators which are undetected at the boundary (and therefore leave the system in a vaccum state) are exactly those of the form Fe,g\u03be , for all g \u2208 G, as any nontrivial h in F h,g \u03be will be detected by the boundary face projectors. This can also be worked out representation-theoretically using Proposition 3.8.\nLemma 4.1. Let K = {e}. Then the multiplicity of an irrep (C,\u03c0) of D(G) with respect to the trivial representation of \u039e(G,{e}) is\nn({e},1)(C ,\u03c0) = \u03b4 C,{e} dim(W\u03c0)\nProof. Applying Proposition 3.8 in the case where V i is trivial, we start with\nn({e},1)(C ,\u03c0) = \u2223G\u2223 \u2223C\u2223\u2223Gc0 \u2223 \u2211c\u2208 C\u2229{e} \u2223{e}c\u2223n1,\u03c0\u0303\nwhere C \u2229 {e} = {e} iff C = {e}, or otherwise \u2205. Also, \u03c0\u0303 = \u2295dim(W\u03c0)({e}, 1), and if C = {e} then \u2223G c0 \u2223 = \u2223G\u2223. \u25fb\nThe factor of dim(W\u03c0) in the rhs implies that there are no other terms in the decomposition of i\u2217({e},\u03c0). In physical terms, this means that the trace ribbon operators We,\u03c0\u03be are the only undetectable trace ribbon operators, and any ribbon operators which do not lie in the block associated to (e,\u03c0) are detectable. In fact, in this case we have a further property which is that all ribbon operators in the chargeon sector are undetectable, as by Eq. (5) chargeon sector ribbon operators are Fourier isomorphic to those of the form Fe,g\u03be in the group basis. In the more general case of a rough boundary for an arbitrary choice of \u039e(R, K) the orientation of the ribbon is important for using the representationtheoretic argument. When K = {e}, for Fe,g\u03be one can check that regardless of orientation the rough boundary version of Proposition 3.17 applies.\nThe K = G case is slightly more complicated:\nLemma 4.2. Let K = G. Then the multiplicity of an irrep (C,\u03c0) of D(G) with respect to the trivial representation of \u039e({e}, G) is\nn({e},1)(C ,\u03c0) = \u03b4\u03c0,1\nProof.

However, there is no factor of \u2223C\u2223 on the rhs and so the decomposition of i\u2217(C, 1) will generally have additional terms other than just ({e}, 1) in \u039e({e},G)M. As a consequence, a fluxion trace ribbon operator W C ,1\u03b6 between smooth boundaries is undetectable iff its associated conjugacy class is a singlet, say C = {c0}, and thus c0 \u2208 Z(G), the centre of G.\nDefinition 4.3. A patch is a finite rectangular lattice segment with two opposite smooth sides, each equipped with boundary conditions K = G, and two opposite rough sides, each equipped with boundary conditions K = {e}, for example:\nOne can alternatively define patches with additional sides, such as in Ref. 33, or with other boundary conditions which depend on another subgroup K and transversal R, but we find this definition convenient. Note that our definition does not put conditions on the size of the lattice; the above diagram is just a conveniently small and yet nontrivial example.\nWe would like to characterise the vacuum space Hvac of the patch. To do this, let us begin with \u2223vac1\u27e9 from Eq. (10), and denote \u2223e\u27e9L \u2236= \u2223vac1\u27e9. This is the logical zero state of the patch. We will use this as a reference state to calculate other states in Hvac.\nNow, for any other state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 in Hvac, there must exist some linear map D \u2208 End(Hvac) such that D\u2223e\u27e9L = \u2223\u03c8\u27e9, and thus if we can characterise the algebra of linear maps End(Hvac), we automatically characterise Hvac. To help with this, we have the following useful property:\nLemma 4.4. Let Fe,g\u03be be a ribbon operator for some g \u2208 G, with \u03be extending from the top rough boundary to the bottom rough boundary. Then the endpoints of \u03be may be moved along the rough boundaries with G = {e} boundary conditions while leaving the action invariant on any vacuum state.\nProof. We explain this on an example patch with initial state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 \u2208 Hvac and a ribbon \u03be. \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 is a linear sum of terms of the following form, and so while this proof uses only one term it applies to any \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 \u2208 Hvac.\nJ. Math. Phys. 64, 102203 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0127285 64, 102203-21\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n19 January 2024 00:40:35\nusing the fact that a = cb and m = lk by the definition of Hvac for the second equality. Thus, we see that the ribbon through the bulk may be deformed as usual. As the only new component of the proof concerned the endpoints, we see that this property holds regardless of the size of the patch. \u25fb\nOne can calculate in particular that Fe,g\u03be \u2223e\u27e9L = \u03b4e,g \u2223e\u27e9L, which we will prove more generally later. The undetectable ribbon operators between the smooth boundaries are of the form\nW C ,1\u03be =\u2211 n\u2208G Fc0 ,n\u03b6\nwhen C = {c0} by Lemma 4.2, hence Gc0 = G. Technically, this lemma only tells us the ribbon trace operators which are undetectable, but in the present case none of the individual component operators are undetectable, only the trace operators. There are thus exactly \u2223Z(G)\u2223 orthogonal undetectable ribbon operators between smooth boundaries. These do not play an important role, but we describe them to characterise the operator algebra on Hvac. They obey a similar rule as Lemma 4.4, which one can check in the same way.\nIn addition to the ribbon operators between sides, we also have undetectable ribbon operators between corners on the lattice. These corners connect smooth and rough boundaries, and thus careful application of specific ribbon operators can avoid detection from either face or vertex measurements,\nwhere one can check that these do indeed leave the system in a vacuum using familiar arguments about B(p) and A(v). We could equally define such operators extending from either left corner to either right corner, and they obey the discrete isotopy laws as in the bulk. If we apply Fh,g\u03be for any g \u2260 e then we have F h,g \u03be \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 = 0 for any \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 \u2208 Hvac, and so these are the only ribbon operators of this form.\nRemark 4.5. Corners of boundaries are algebraically interesting themselves, and can be used for quantum computation, but for brevity we skim over them. See e.g. Refs. 34 and 35 for details.\nThese corner to corner, left to right and top to bottom ribbon operators span End(Hvac), the linear maps which leave the system in the vacuum. Due to Lemma 2.5, all other linear maps must decompose into ribbon operators, and these are the only ribbon operators in End(Hvac) up to linearity.\nJ. Math. Phys. 64, 102203 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0127285 64, 102203-22\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n19 January 2024 00:40:35\nAs a consequence, we have well-defined patch states \u2223h\u27e9L \u2236= \u2211g F h,g \u03be \u2223e\u27e9L for each h \u2208 G, where \u03be is any ribbon extending from the bottom\nleft corner to right. Now, working explicitly on the small patch below, we have\nto start with, then:\nIt is easy to see that we may always write \u2223h\u27e9L in this manner, for an arbitrary size of patch. Now, ribbon operators which are undetectable when \u03be extends from bottom to top are those of the form Fe,g\u03be , for example\nJ. Math. Phys. 64, 102203 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0127285 64, 102203-23\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n19 January 2024 00:40:35\nand so Fe,g\u03be \u2223h\u27e9L = \u03b4g,h\u2223h\u27e9L, where again if we take a larger patch all additional terms will clearly cancel. Lastly, undetectable ribbon operators for a ribbon \u03b6 extending from left to right are exactly those of the form\u2211n \u2208G Fc0 ,n\u03b6 for any c0 \u2208 Z(G). One can check that \u2223c0h\u27e9L = \u2211n \u2208G F c0 ,n \u03b6 \u2223h\u27e9L, thus these give us no new states in Hvac.\nLemma 4.6. For a patch with the D(G)model in the bulk, dim(Hvac) = \u2223G\u2223.\nProof. By the above characterisation of undetectable ribbon operators, the states {\u2223h\u27e9L}h \u2208G span dim(Hvac). The result then follows from the adjointness of ribbon operators, which means that the states {\u2223h\u27e9L}h \u2208G are orthogonal. \u25fb\nWe can also work out that for \u2223vac2\u27e9 from Eq. (11), we have \u2223vac2\u27e9 = \u2211h\u2223h\u27e9L. More generally:\nCorollary 4.7. Hvac has an alternative basis with states \u2223\u03c0; i, j\u27e9L, where \u03c0 is an irreducible representation of G and i, j are indices such that 0 \u2264 i, j < dim(V\u03c0). We call this the quasiparticle basis of the patch.\nProof. First, use the nonabelian Fourier transform on the ribbon operators Fe,g\u03be , so we have F \u2032e,\u03c0;i, j \u03be = \u2211n \u2208G \u03c0(n \u22121) jiFe,n\u03be . If we start from the reference state \u22231; 0, 0\u27e9L \u2236= \u2211h \u2223h\u27e9L = \u2223vac2\u27e9 and apply these operators with \u03be from bottom to top of the patch then we get\n\u2223\u03c0; i, j\u27e9L = F \u2032e,\u03c0;i, j \u03be \u22231; 0, 0\u27e9L =\u2211 n\u2208G \u03c0(n\u22121)ji\u2223n\u27e9L\nwhich are orthogonal. Now, as\u2211\u03c0 \u2208G\u0302\u2211 dim(V\u03c0) i, j=0 = \u2223G\u2223 and we know dim(Hvac) = \u2223G\u2223 by the previous Lemma 4.6, {\u2223\u03c0; i, j\u27e9L}\u03c0,i, j forms a basis of dim(Hvac). \u25fb\nRemark 4.8. Kitaev models are designed in general to detect and correct for errors. The minimum number of component Hilbert spaces, that is copies of CG on edges, for which simultaneous errors will undetectably change the logical state and cause errors in the computation is called the \u201ccode distance\u201d d in the language of quantum codes. For the standard method of computation using nonabelian anyons,1 data is encoded using excited states, which are states with nontrivial quasiparticles at certain sites. The code distance can then be extremely small, and constant in the size of the lattice, as the smallest errors need only take the form of ribbon operators winding round a single quasiparticle at a site. This is no longer the case when encoding data in vacuum states on patches, as the only logical operators are specific ribbon operators extending from top to bottom, left to right or corner to corner. The code distance, and hence error resilience, of any vacuum state of the patch therefore increases linearly with the width of the patch as it is scaled, and so the square root of the number n of component Hilbert spaces in the patch, that is d \u2208 \u0398( \u221a n)."

            "text": "Lattice surgery was invented as a method of fault-tolerant computation with the qubit, i.e. CZ2, surface code.15 The first author generalised it to qudit models using CZd in Ref. 36, and gave a fresh perspective on lattice surgery as \u201csimulating\u201d the Hopf algebras CZd and C(Zd) on the logical space Hvac of a patch. In this section, we prove that lattice surgery generalises to arbitrary finite group models, and \u201csimulates\u201d CG and C(G) in a similar way. Throughout, we assume that the projectors A(v) and B(p) may be performed deterministically for simplicity. In Appendix B we discuss the added complication that in practice we may only perform measurements which yield projections nondeterministically.\nRemark 4.9. When proving the linear maps that nonabelian lattice surgeries yield, we will use specific examples, but the arguments clearly hold generally. For convenience, we will also tend to omit normalising scalar factors, which do not impact the calculations as the maps are C-linear.\nLet us begin with a large rectangular patch. We now remove a line of edges from left to right by projecting each one onto e:\nJ. Math.

We then have that the last expression is\nObserve the factors of g in particular. The state is therefore now \u2211g \u2223g\u22121\u27e9L \u2297 \u2223gl\u27e9L, where the lhs of the tensor product is the Hilbert space corresponding to the top patch, and the rhs to the bottom. A change of variables gives \u2211g \u2223g\u27e9L \u2297 \u2223g\u22121l\u27e9L, the outcome of comultiplication of C(G) on the logical state \u2223l\u27e9L of the original patch.\nSimilarly, we can measure out a line of edges from bottom to top, for example\nWe call this a smooth split, as we create two new smooth boundaries. Each deleted edge is projected into the state 1\u2223G\u2223\u2211g g. We also cease measurement of the faces which have had edges removed, and so we end up with two adjacent but disjoint patches. Working on a small example, we start with \u2223e\u27e9L:\nJ. Math.

Thus, we have ended with two disjoint patches, each in state \u2223e\u27e9L. One can see that this works for any \u2223h\u27e9L in exactly the same way, and so the smooth split linear map is \u2223h\u27e9L \u21a6 \u2223h\u27e9L \u2297 \u2223h\u27e9L, the comultiplication of CG.\nThe opposite of splits are merges, whereby we take two disjoint patches and introduce edges to bring them together to a single patch.

The logical antipode SL is given by applying the antipode to each edge individually, i.e. inverting all group elements. For example:\nThis state is now no longer in the original Hvac, so to compensate we must modify the lattice. We flip all arrows in the lattice:\nJ. Math.

In the resultant new vacuum space, the state is now \u2223g\u22121\u27e9L = Fe,g \u22121\n\u03be \u2223e\u27e9L, with \u03be running from the bottom left corner to bottom right as previously.\nRemark 4.10. This trick of redefining the vacuum space is employed in Ref. 15 to perform logical Hadamards, although in their case the lattice is rotated by \u03c0/2, and the edges are directionless as the model is restricted to CZ2.\nThus, we have all the ingredients of the Hopf algebras CG and C(G) on the same vector space Hvac. For applications, one should like to know which quantum computations can be performed using these algebras (ignoring the subtlety with nondeterministic projectors). Recall that a quantum computer is called approximately universal if for any target unitary U and desired accuracy \u03f5 \u2208 R, the computer can perform a unitary V such that \u2225V \u2212U\u2225 \u2264 \u03f5, i.e. the operator norm error of V from U is no greater than \u03f5.\nWe believe that when the computer is equipped with just the states {\u2223h\u27e9L}h \u2208G and the maps from lattice surgery above then one cannot achieve approximately universal computation,37 but leave the proof to a further paper. If we also have access to all matrix algebra states \u2223\u03c0; i, j\u27e9L as defined in Corollary 4.7, we do not know whether the model of computation is then universal for some choice of G, and we do not know whether these states can be prepared efficiently. In fact, how these states are defined depends on a choice of basis for each irrep, so whether it is universal may depend not only on the choice of G but also choices of basis. The computational power of nonabelian lattice surgery is an interesting question for future work."

            "text": "We now return to our boundary algebra \u039e. It is known that \u039e has a great deal more structure. This structure generalises a well-known bicrossproduct Hopf algebra construction for when a finite group G factorises as G = RK into two subgroups R, K. Then each acts on the set of the other to form a matched pair of actions \u22b3,\u22b2 and we use \u22b3 to make a cross product algebra CK\u25b9< C(R) (which has the same form as our algebra \u039e except that we have chosen to flip the tensor factors) and \u22b2 to make a cross product coalgebra CK >\u25c2C(R). These fit together to form a bicrossproduct Hopf algebra CK \u25b9\u25c2C(R). This construction has been used in the Lie group version to construct quantum Poincar\u00e9 groups for quantum spacetimes.25 In this section we describe the more general \u039e(R, K) and in more detail than we have seen elsewhere. In physical terms the \u201ccoproduct\u201d \u0394 : \u039e\u2192 \u039e\u2297 \u039e explicitly controls the tensor product of representations, not only up to isomorphism, and the antialgebra \u201cantipode\u201d S : \u039e\u2192 \u039e explicitly controls left-right conversion and hence adjunction of representations.\nIn Ref. 38 was considered the more general case where rather than R and K both being subgroups we are just given a single subgroup K \u2286 G and a choice of transversal R with the group identity e \u2208 R. As we noted, we still have unique factorisation G = RK but in general R need not be a group. We can still follow the same steps. First of all, unique factorisation entails that R \u2229 K = {e}. It also implies maps\n\u25b9 : K \u00d7 R\u2192 R, \u25c3 : K \u00d7 R\u2192 K, \u22c5 : R \u00d7 R\u2192 R, \u03c4 : R \u00d7 R\u2192 K\ndefined by xr = (x \u25b9 r)(x \u25c3 r), rs = r \u22c5 s\u03c4(r, s)\nfor all x \u2208 K, r, s \u2208 R, but this time these inherit the properties\n(xy) \u25b9 r = x \u25b9 (y \u25b9 r), e \u25b9 r = r, x \u25b9 (r \u22c5 s) = (x \u25b9 r) \u22c5 ((x \u25c3 r) \u25b9 s), x \u25b9 e = e, (12)\n(x \u25c3 r) \u25c3 s = \u03c4(x \u25b9 r, (x \u25c3 r) \u25b9 s)\u22121(x \u25c3 (r \u22c5 s))\u03c4(r, s), x \u25c3 e = x, (xy) \u25c3 r = (x \u25c3 (y \u25b9 r))(y \u25c3 r), e \u25c3 r = e, (13)\n\u03c4(r, s \u22c5 t)\u03c4(s, t) = \u03c4(r \u22c5 s, \u03c4(r, s) \u25b9 t)(\u03c4(r, s) \u25c3 t), \u03c4(e, r) = \u03c4(r, e) = e, r \u22c5 (s \u22c5 t) = (r \u22c5 s) \u22c5 (\u03c4(r, s) \u25b9 t), r \u22c5 e = e \u22c5 r = r (14)\nfor all x, y \u2208 K and r, s, t \u2208 R. We see from (12) that \u22b3 is indeed an action (we have been using it in preceding sections) but \u22b2 in (13) is only only up to \u03c4 (termed in Ref. 18 a \u201cquasiaction\u201d). Both \u22b3,\u22b2 \u201cact\u201d almost by automorphisms but with a back-reaction by the other just as for a matched pair of groups. Meanwhile, we see from (14) that \u22c5 is associative only up to \u03c4 and \u03c4 itself obeys a kind of cocycle condition.\nClearly, R is a subgroup via \u22c5 if and only if \u03c4(r, s) = e for all r, s, and in this case we already see that \u039e(R, K) is a bicrossproduct Hopf algebra, with the only difference being that we prefer to build it on the flipped tensor factors. More generally,38 showed that there is still a natural monoidal category associated to this data but with nontrivial associators. This corresponds by Tannaka\u2013Krein reconstruction to a \u039e as quasi-bialgebra which in some cases is a quasi-Hopf algebra.19 Here we will give these latter structures explicitly and in maximum generality compared to the literature (but still needing a restriction on R for the antipode to be in a regular form). We will also show that the obvious \u2217- algebra structure makes a \u2217-quasi-Hopf algebra in an appropriate sense under restrictions on R. These aspects are new, but more importantly,\nJ. Math.

Related works on similar algebras and coset decompositions include Refs. 39 and 40 in addition to Refs. 18, 19, and 38.\nLemma 5.1 (Refs. 18, 19, and 38). (R, \u22c5) has the same unique identity e as G and has the left division property, i.e. for all t, s \u2208 R, there is a unique solution r \u2208 R to the equation s \u22c5 r = t (one writes r = s/t). In particular, we let rR denote the unique solution to r \u22c5 rR = e, which we call a right inverse.\nThis means that (R, \u22c5) is a left loop (a left quasigroup with identity). The multiplication table for (R, \u22c5) has one of each element of R in each row, which is the left division property. In particular, there is one instance of e in each row. One can recover G knowing (R, \u22c5), K and the data \u22b3,\u22b2, \u03c4 (Ref. 18, Proposition 3.4). Note that a parallel property of left inverse ( )L need not be present.\nDefinition 5.2. We say that R is regular if ( )R is bijective.\nR is regular iff it has both left and right inverses, and this is iff it satisfies RK = KR by Ref. 18, Proposition 3.5. If there is also right division then we have a loop (a quasigroup with identity) and under further conditions (Ref. 18, Proposition 3.6) we have rL = rR and a two-sided inverse property quasigroup. The case of regular R is studied in Ref. 19 but this excludes some interesting choices of R and we do not always assume it. Throughout, we will specify when R is required to be regular for results to hold. Finally, if R obeys a further condition x \u22b3 (s \u22c5 t) = (x \u22b3 s) \u22b3 t in Ref. 18 then \u039e is a Hopf quasigroup in the sense introduced in Ref. 40. This is even more restrictive but will apply to our octonions-related example. Here we just give the choices for our go-to cases for S3.\nExample 5.3. G = S3 with K = {e, u} has four choices of transversal R meeting our requirement that e \u2208 R. Namely\n(1) R = {e, uv, vu} (our standard choice) is a subgroup R = Z3, so it is associative and there is two-sided division and a two-sided inverse. We also have u \u22b3 (uv) = vu, u \u22b3 (vu) = uv but \u22b2, \u03c4 trivial. (2) R = {e,w, v} which is not a subgroup and indeed \u03c4(v,w) = \u03c4(w, v) = u (and all others are necessarily e). There is an action u \u22b3 v = w, u \u22b3 w = v but \u22b2 is still trivial. For examples\nvw = wu\u21d2 v \u22c5w = w, \u03c4(v,w) = u; wv = vu\u21d2 w \u22c5 v = v, \u03c4(w, v) = u uv = wu\u21d2 u \u25b9 v = w, u \u25c3 v = u; uw = vu\u21d2 u \u25b9w = v, u \u25c3w = u.\nThis has left division/right inverses as it must but not right division as e \u22c5w = v \u22c5w = w and e \u22c5 v = w \u22c5 v = v. We also have v \u22c5 v = w \u22c5w = e and ( )R is bijective so this is regular.\n(3) R = {e, uv, v} which is not a subgroup and \u03c4,\u22b3,\u22b2 are all nontrivial with\n\u03c4(uv, uv) = \u03c4(v, uv) = \u03c4(uv, v) = u, \u03c4(v, v) = e, v \u22c5 v = e, v \u22c5 uv = uv, uv \u22c5 v = e, uv \u22c5 uv = v,\nu \u25b9 v = uv, u \u25b9 (uv) = v, u \u25c3 v = e, u \u25c3 uv = e\nand all other cases determined from the properties of e. Here vR = v and (uv)R = v so this is not regular. (4) R = {e,w, vu} which is analogous to the preceding case, so not a subgroup, \u03c4,\u22b3,\u22b2 all nontrivial and not regular.\nWe will also need the following useful lemma in some of our proofs.\nLemma 5.4 (Ref. 18). For any transversal R with e \u2208 R, we have\n(1) (x \u22b2 r)\u22121 = x\u22121 \u22b2 (x \u22b3 r); (2) (x \u22b3 r)R = (x \u22b2 r) \u22b3 rR; (3) \u03c4(r, rR)\u22121 \u25c3 r = \u03c4(rR, rRR)\u22121; (4) \u03c4(r, rR)\u22121 \u25c3 r = rRR;\nfor all x \u2208 K, r \u2208 R.\nProof. The first two items are elementary from the matched pair axioms. For (1), we use e = (x\u22121x) \u22b2 r = (x\u22121 \u22b2 (x \u22b3 r))(x \u22b2 r) and for (2) e = x \u22b3 (r \u22c5 rR) = (x \u22b3 r) \u22c5 ((x \u22b2 r) \u22b3 rR). The other two items are a left-right reversal of Ref. 18, Lemma 3.2 but given here for completeness. For (3),\ne = (\u03c4(r, rR)\u03c4(r, rR)\u22121) \u25c3 r = (\u03c4(r, rR) \u25c3 (\u03c4(r, rR) \u25b9 r))(\u03c4(r, rR)\u22121 \u25c3 r) = (\u03c4(r, rR) \u25c3 rRR)(\u03c4(r, rR)\u22121 \u25c3 r)\nwhich we combine with\n\u03c4(rR, rRR) = \u03c4(r \u22c5 rR, rRR)\u03c4(rR, rRR) = \u03c4(r \u22c5 rR, \u03c4(r, rR) \u25b9 rRR)(\u03c4(r, rR) \u25c3 rRR) = \u03c4(r, rR) \u25c3 rRR\nby the cocycle property. For (4), \u03c4(r, rR) \u22b2 rRR = (r \u22c5 rR)\u03c4(r, rR) \u22b2 rRR = r \u22c5 (rR \u22c5 rRR) = r by one of the matched pair conditions. \u25fb\nJ. Math.

Renaming t\u2032 to t, the two sides are equal in view of the cocycle identity for \u03c4. Thus, we have a quasi-bialgebra with \u03d5 as stated. \u25fb\nThis is of the same semidirect product (but dual) form as the coquasi-Hopf algebra noted in Ref. 18, Remark 4.3 and also known in Ref. 19, however. A coproduct is also stated in Ref. 6 but in very different notations and without proof. Physically, recall that we consider the representations of \u039e(R, K) to be quasiparticles located at the boundary of the Kitaev model, with the restriction that we cannot have multiplicities of irreps greater than 1 as per Proposition 3.19. As \u039e(R, K) is a quasi-bialgebra, \u039eM is monoidal, albeit with a nontrivial associator, and hence we can have quasiparticles existing in separate locations; considering time as well, this means parallel worldlines of boundary quasiparticles are allowed by the theory, as one would expect. The nontrivial associator is an interesting feature, and one which the bulk D(G)M model does not exhibit. We discuss this in further detail in Sec. VI.\nRemark 5.6. If we want to write the coproduct on \u039e explicitly as a vector space, the above becomes\n\u0394(\u03b4r \u2297 x) =\u2211 s\u22c5t=r\n\u03b4s \u2297 x\u2297 \u03b4t \u2297 (x\u22121 \u25c3 s)\u22121, \u03f5(\u03b4r \u2297 x) = \u03b4r,e\nwhich is ugly due to our decision to build it on C(R)\u2297CK. (2) If we built it on the other order then we could have \u039e = CK\u25b9< C(R) as an algebra, where we have a right action\n( f \u25c3 x)(r) = f (x \u25b9 r); \u03b4r \u25c3 x = \u03b4x\u22121\u25b9r\non f \u2208 C(R). Now make a right handed cross product\n(x\u2297 \u03b4r)(y\u2297 \u03b4s) = xy\u2297 (\u03b4r \u25c3 y)\u03b4s = xy\u2297 \u03b4s\u03b4r,y\u25b9s\nwhich has cross relations \u03b4ry = y\u03b4y\u22121\u25b9r . These are the same relations as before. So this is the same algebra, just we prioritise a basis {x\u03b4r} instead of the other way around. This time, we have\n\u0394(x\u2297 \u03b4r) =\u2211 s\u22c5t=r x\u2297 \u03b4s \u2297 x \u25c3 s\u2297 \u03b4t.\nWe do not do this in order to be compatible with the most common form of D(G) as C(G)>\u25c3CG as in Ref. 5.\nLemma 5.7. The \u2217-algebra structure on \u039e(R, K) commutes with the coproduct and counit, \u0394\u25cb\u2217 = (\u2217\u2297\u2217) \u25cb \u0394 and \u03f5 \u25cb \u2217 = \u03f5( ). Moreover \u03d5\u2217\u2297\u2217\u2297\u2217 = \u03d5\u22121.\nProof. Since \u2217 is an involution it is enough to check the assertion on x \u2208 K and \u03b4r \u2208 C(R) separately. The latter is immediate from the form of \u0394\u03b4r in Lemma 5.5 and \u03b4\u2217r = \u03b4r . For the other case, we have\nJ. Math.

But it is true for a usual Hopf \u2217-algebra where it is important for preserving unitarity (in a Hopf sense defined by \u2217) of tensor products of representations, hence it is convenient that it also applies to \u039e(R, K). The latter is also a \u2217-quasibialgebra but this is deferred to Appendix C."

Moreover, \u2217S acts as the identity on our basis (but is antilinear).\nWe also note that the algebras \u039e(R, K) here are manifestly isomorphic for the two R, but the coproducts are different, so the tensor products of representations is different, although they turn out isomorphic. The set of irreps does not change either, but how we construct them can look different. We will see in the next that this is part of a monoidal equivalence of categories.\nExample 5.11. S2 \u2282 S3 with its second transversal. Here R has two orbits: (a) C = {e} with r0 = e, Kr0 = K with two 1-diml irreps V\u03c1 as \u03c1 = trivial and \u03c1 = sign, and hence two irreps of \u039e(R, K); (b) C = {w, v} with r0 = v or r0 = w, both with Kr0 = {e} and hence only \u03c1 trivial, leading to one two-dimensional irrep of \u039e(R, K). So, altogether, there are again three irreps of \u039e(R, K):\nV({e},\u03c1) : \u03b4r.1 = \u03b4r,e, u.1 = \u00b11, V ({w,v}),1) : \u03b4r.v = \u03b4r,vv, \u03b4r.w = \u03b4r,ww, u.v = w, u.w = v\nacting on C and on the span of v,w respectively. These irreps are equivalent to what we had in Example 3.9 when computing irreps from the standard R."

This is an equivalent point of view, but we prefer our more explicit one based on R, hence details are omitted.\nAlso note that the category K MGK of G-graded K-bimodules has an obvious monoidal structure inherited from that of K-bimodules, where we tensor product over CK. Here \u2223w\u2297CKw\u2032\u2223 = \u2223w\u2225w\u2032\u2223 in G is well-defined and x.(w\u2297CKw\u2032).y = x.w\u2297CKw\u2032.y has degree x\u2223w\u2225w\u2032\u2223y = x\u2223w\u2297CKw\u2032\u2223y as required.\nProposition 6.3. We let R be a transversal and W = V \u2297CK made into a G-graded K-bimodule by\nx.(v \u2297 z).y = x.v \u2297 (x \u25c3 \u2223v\u2223)zy, \u2223v \u2297 z\u2223 = \u2223v\u2223z \u2208 G,\nwhere now we view \u2223v\u2223 \u2208 R as the chosen representative of \u2223v\u2223 \u2208 G/K. This gives a functor F : \u039eM \u2192 K MGK which is a monoidal equivalence for a suitable quasibialgebra structure on \u039e(R, K). The latter depends on R since F depends on R.\nProof. We define F(V) as stated, which is clearly a right module that commutes with the left action, and the latter is a module structure as\nx.(y.(v \u2297 z)) = x.(y.v \u2297 (y \u25c3 \u2223v\u2223)z) = xy.v \u2297 (x \u25c3 (y \u25b9 \u2223v\u2223))(y \u25c3 \u2223v\u2223)z = (xy).(v \u2297 z)\nusing the matched pair axiom for (xy) \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223. We also check that \u2223x.(v \u2297 z).y\u2223 = \u2223x.v\u2223zy = (x \u22b3 \u2223v\u2223)(x \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223)zy = x\u2223v\u2223zy = x\u2223v \u2297 z\u2223y. Hence, we have a G-graded K-bimodule. Conversely, if W is a G-graded K-bimodule, we let\nV = {w \u2208W \u2223 \u2223w\u2223 \u2208 R}, x.v = xv(x \u25c3 \u2223v\u2223)\u22121, \u03b4r.v = \u03b4r,\u2223v\u2223v,\nwhere v on the right is viewed in W and we use the K-bimodule structure. This is arranged so that x.v on the left lives in V . Indeed, \u2223x.v\u2223 = x\u2223v\u2223(x \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223)\u22121 = x \u22b3 \u2223v\u2223 and x.(y.v) = xyv(y \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223)\u22121(x \u22b2 (y \u22b3 \u2223v\u2223))\u22121 = xyv((xy) \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223)\u22121 by the matched pair condition, as required for a representation of \u039e(R, K). One can check that this is inverse to the other direction. Thus, given W = \u2295rx\u2208GWrx = \u2295x\u2208K WRx, where we let WRx = \u2295r\u2208RWrx, the right action by x \u2208 K gives an isomorphism WRx \u2245 V \u2297 x as vector spaces and hence recovers W = V \u2297CK. This clearly has the correct right K-action and from the left x.(v \u2297 z) = xv(x \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223)\u22121 \u2297 (x \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223)z, which under the identification maps to xv(x \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223)\u22121(x \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223)z = xvz \u2208W as required given that v \u2297 z maps to vz in W.\nNow, if V , V\u2032 are \u039e(R, K)modules then as vector spaces,\nF(V)\u2297CK F(V\u2032) = (V \u2297CK)\u2297CK(V\u2032 \u2297CK) = V \u2297 V\u2032 \u2297CK fV ,V\u2032\u2245 F(V \u2297 V\u2032)\nby the obvious identifications except that in the last step we allow ourselves the possibility of a nontrivial isomorphism as vector spaces. For the actions on the two sides,\nx.(v \u2297 v\u2032 \u2297 z).y = x.(v \u2297 v\u2032)\u2297 (x \u25c3 \u2223v \u2297 v\u2032\u2223)zy = x.v \u2297 (x \u25c3 \u2223v\u2223).v\u2032 \u2297 ((x \u25c3 \u2223v\u2223) \u25c3 \u2223v\u2032\u2223)zy,\nwhere on the right, we have x.(v \u2297 1) = x.v \u2297 x \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223 and then take x \u22b2 \u2223v\u2223 via the \u2297CK to act on v\u2032 \u2297 z as per our identification.

Likewise, looking at the grading of F(V \u2297 V\u2032) and comparing with the grading of F(V)\u2297CK F(V\u2032), we need to define \u2223v \u2297 v\u2032\u2223 = \u2223v\u2223 \u22c5 \u2223v\u2032\u2223 \u2208 R and use \u2223v\u2223 \u22c5 \u2223v\u2032\u2223\u03c4(\u2223v\u2223, \u2223v\u2032\u2223) = \u2223v\u2225v\u2032\u2223 to match the degree on the left hand side.

Hence, we have:\nCorollary 6.5. If R has ( )R bijective giving a quasi-Hopf algebra with regular antipode S,\u03b1 = 1,\u03b2 as in Theorem 5.8 and R\u0304 is another transversal then \u039e(R\u0304, K) in the twisting form of Theorem 6.4 has an antipode\nS\u0304 = S, \u03b1\u0304 =\u2211 r \u03b4rR cr , \u03b2\u0304 =\u2211 r \u03b4r\u03c4(r, rR)(c\u22121r \u25c3 rR)\u22121.\nThis is a regular antipode if ( )R for R\u0304 is also bijective (i.e. \u03b1\u0304 is then invertible and can be transformed back to standard form to make it 1).\nProof. We work with the initial quasi-Hopf algebra \u039e(R, K) and \u22b3,\u22b2, \u03c4 refer to this but note that \u039e(R\u0304, K) is the same algebra when \u03b4r is identified with the corresponding \u03b4r\u0304 . Then\n\u03b1\u0304 = (S\u03c71)\u03c72 =\u2211 r S\u03b4r \u2297 cr = \u03b4rR cr\nusing the formula for S\u03b4r = \u03b4rR in Theorem 5.8. Similarly, \u03c7 \u22121 = \u2211r \u03b4r \u2297 c\u22121r and we use S,\u03b2 from the above lemma, where\nS(1\u2297 x) =\u2211 s \u03b4(x\u22121\u25b9s)R \u2297 x \u22121 \u25c3 s =\u2211 t \u03b4tR \u2297 x \u22121 \u25c3 (x \u25b9 t) =\u2211 t \u03b4tR \u2297 (x \u25c3 t) \u22121.\nThen\n\u03b2\u0304 = \u03c7\u22121\u03b2S\u03c7\u22122 =\u2211 r,s,t \u03b4r\u03b4s\u03c4(s, sR)\u03b4tR(c \u22121 r \u25c3 t)\u22121\n=\u2211 r,t \u03b4r\u03c4(r, rR)\u03b4tR(c \u22121 r \u25c3 t)\u22121 =\u2211 r,t \u03b4r\u03b4\u03c4(r,rR)\u25b9tR\u03c4(r, r R)(c\u22121r \u25c3 t)\u22121.\nCommuting the \u03b4-functions to the left requires r = \u03c4(r, rR) \u22b3 tR or rRR = \u03c4(r, rR)\u22121 \u25b9 r = tR so t = rR under our assumptions, giving the answer stated.\nIf ( )R is bijective then \u03b1\u0304\u22121 = \u2211r c\u22121r \u03b4rR = \u2211r \u03b4c\u22121r \u25b9rR c \u22121 r provides the left inverse. On the other side, we need c\u22121r \u25b9 rR = c\u22121s \u25b9 sR iff r = s. This is true if ( )R for R\u0304 is also bijective. That is because, if we write ( )R\u0304 for the right inverse with respect to R\u0304, one can show by comparing the factorisations that\ns\u0304 R\u0304 = c\u22121s \u25b9 sR, sR = cs\u25b9\u0304s\u0304 R\u0304\nand we use the first of these. \u25fb\nExample 6.6. With reference to the list of transversals for S2 \u2282 S3, we have four quasi-Hopf algebras of which two were already computed in Example 5.10.\n(i) Second transversal as twist of the first. Here \u039e\u0304 is generated byZ2 as u again and \u03b4r\u0304 with R\u0304 = {e,w, v}. We have the same cosets represented by these with e\u0304 = e, uv = w and vu = v, which means ce = e, cvu = u, cuv = u. To compare the algebras in the two cases, we identify\nJ. Math.

The cochain from Theorem 6.4 is\n\u03c7 = \u03b4e \u2297 e + (\u03b4vu + \u03b4uv)\u2297 u = \u03b40 \u2297 1 + (\u03b41 + \u03b42)\u2297 u = \u03b40 \u2297 1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b40)\u2297 u\nas an element of \u039e\u2297 \u039e. One can check that this conjugates the two coproducts as claimed. We also have\n\u03c72 = 1\u2297 1, (\u03f5\u2297 id)\u03c7 = (id\u2297 \u03f5)\u03c7 = 1.\nWe spot check (16), for example v \u22c5\u0304w = vu \u22c5\u0304 uv = uv = vuvu = vu(u \u25b9 (uv)), as it had to be. We should therefore find that\n((\u0394\u2297 id)\u03c7)\u03c712 = ((id\u2297 \u0394)\u03c7)\u03c723\u03d5\u0304.\nWe have checked directly that this indeed holds. Next, the antipode of the first transversal should twist to\nS\u0304 = S, \u03b1\u0304 = \u03b4ece + \u03b4uvcvu + \u03b4vucuv = \u03b4e(e \u2212 u) + u = \u03b4ece + \u03b4vucvu + \u03b4uvcuv = \u03b2\u0304\nby Corollary 6.5 for twisting the antipode. Here, U = \u03b1\u0304\u22121 = \u03b2\u0304 = U\u22121 and S\u0304 \u2032 = U(S )U\u22121 with \u03b1\u0304 \u2032 = \u03b2\u0304 \u2032 = 1 should also be an antipode. We can check this:\nUu = (\u03b40(e \u2212 u) + u)u = \u03b40(u \u2212 e) + e = u(\u03b4u\u22121\u25b90(e \u2212 u) + u) = uU\nso S\u0304 \u2032u = UuU\u22121 = u, and S\u0304 \u2032\u03b41 = U(S\u03b41)U = U\u03b42U = (\u03b40(e \u2212 u) + u)\u03b42(\u03b40(e \u2212 u) + u) = \u03b41.\n(ii) Third transversal as a twist of the first. A mixed up choice is R\u0304 = {e, uv, v} which is not a subgroup so \u03c4 is nontrivial. One has\n\u03c4(uv, uv) = \u03c4(v, uv) = \u03c4(uv, v) = u, \u03c4(v, v) = e, v \u22c5 v = e, v \u22c5 uv = uv, uv \u22c5 v = e, uv \u22c5 uv = v,\nu \u25b9 v = uv, u \u25b9 (uv) = v, u \u25c3 v = e, u \u25c3 uv = e\nand all other cases implied from the properties of e. Here vR = v and (uv)R = v. These are with respect to R\u0304, but note that twisting calculations will take place with respect to R.\nWriting \u03b40 = \u03b4e, \u03b41 = \u03b4uv , \u03b42 = \u03b4v we have the same algebra as before (as we had to) and now the coproduct etc.,\n\u0394\u0304u = u\u2297 1 + \u03b40u\u2297 (u \u2212 1), \u0394\u0304\u03b40 = \u03b40 \u2297 \u03b40 + \u03b42 \u2297 \u03b42 + \u03b41 \u2297 \u03b42,\n\u0394\u0304\u03b41 = \u03b40 \u2297 \u03b41 + \u03b41 \u2297 \u03b40 + \u03b42 \u2297 \u03b41, \u0394\u0304\u03b42 = \u03b40 \u2297 \u03b42 + \u03b42 \u2297 \u03b40 + \u03b41 \u2297 \u03b41,\n\u03d5\u0304 = 1\u2297 1\u2297 1 + (\u03b41 \u2297 \u03b42 + \u03b42 \u2297 \u03b41 + \u03b41 \u2297 \u03b41)(u \u2212 1) = \u03d5\u0304\u22121\nfor the quasibialgebra. We used the \u03c4,\u22b3,\u22b2, \u22c5 for R\u0304 for these direct calculations.

The fourth transversal has a similar pattern to the third, so we do not list its coproduct etc. explicitly.\nIn general, there will be many different choices of transversal. For Sn\u22121 \u2282 Sn, the first two transversals for S2 \u2282 S3 generalise as follows, giving a Hopf algebra and a strictly quasi-Hopf algebra respectively.\nExample 6.7.\n(i) First transversal. Here R = Zn is a subgroup with i = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 mod n corresponding to the elements (12 . . .n)i. Neither subgroup is normal for n \u2265 4, so both actions are nontrivial but \u03c4 is trivial. This expresses Sn as a double cross product Zn & Sn\u22121 (with trivial \u03c4) and the matched pair of actions\n\u03c3 \u25b9 i = \u03c3(i), (\u03c3 \u25c3 i)( j) = \u03c3(i + j) \u2212 \u03c3(i)\nfor i, j = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, where we add and subtract mod n but view the results in the range 1, . . . , n. This was actually found by twisting from the second transversal below, but we can check it directly as follows. First.\n\u03c3(1 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5n)i = (\u03c3 \u25b9 i)(\u03c3 \u25c3 i) = (12 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5n)\u03c3(i)((1 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5n)\u2212\u03c3(i)\u03c3(12 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5n)i)\nand we check that the second factor sends n\u2192 i\u2192 \u03c3(i)\u2192 n, hence lies in Sn. It follows by the known fact of unique factorisation into these subgroups that this factor is \u03c3 \u22b2 i.

The required cochain from Theorem 6.4 is\n\u03c7 = \u03b40 \u2297 1 + n\u22121 \u2211 i=1 \u03b4i \u2297 (12 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5n)\u2212i(in).\nThe above example is a little similar to the Drinfeld Uq(g) as Hopf algebras which are cochain twists of U(g) viewed as a quasi-Hopf algebra. We conclude with the promised example related to the octonions. This is a version of Ref. 18, Example 4.6, but with left and right swapped and some cleaned up conventions.\nExample 6.8. We let G = Cl3>\u25c3Z32, where Cl3 is generated by 1,\u22121 and ei, i = 1, 2, 3, with relations\n(\u22121)2 = 1, (\u22121)ei = ei(\u22121), e2i = \u22121, eiej = \u2212ejei\nfor i \u2260 j and the usual combination rules for the product of signs. Its elements can be enumerated as \u00b1ea\u20d7 where a\u20d7 \u2208 Z32 is viewed in the additive group of three-vectors with entries in the field F2 = {0, 1} of order 2 and\nea\u20d7 = ea11 e a2 2 e a3 3 , ea\u20d7eb\u20d7 = ea\u20d7+b\u20d7(\u22121) \u2211i\u2265j aibj .\nThis is the twisted group ring description of the three-dimensional Clifford algebra over R in Ref. 41, but now restricted to coefficients 0,\u00b11 to give a group of order 16. For an example,\ne110e101 = e2e3e1e3 = e1e2e23 = \u2212e1e2 = \u2212e011 = \u2212e110+101\nwith the sign given by the formula. We similarly write the elements of K = Z32 multiplicatively as g a\u20d7 = ga11 g a2 1 g a3 3 labelled by three-vectors with values in F2. The generators gi commute and obey g2i = e. The general group product becomes the vector addition, and the cross relations are\n(\u22121)gi = gi(\u22121), eigi = \u2212giei, eigj = gjei\nfor i \u2260 j. This implies that G has order 128.\n(i) If we take R = Cl3 itself then this will be a subgroup and we will have for \u039e(R, K) an ordinary Hopf \u2217-algebra as a semidirect product CZ32\u25b9< C(Cl3) except that we build it on the opposite tensor product.\n(ii) Instead, we take as representatives the eight elements again labelled by three-vectors over F2,\nr000 = 1, r001 = e3, r010 = e2, r011 = e2e3g1\nr100 = e1, r101 = e1e3g2, r110 = e1e2g3, r111 = e1e2e3g1g2g3\nand their negations, as a version of Ref. 18, Example 4.6.

            "text": "This section does not contain anything new beyond,10,42 but completes the categorical picture that connects our algebra \u039e(R, K) to the more general context of module categories, adapted to our notations. Our first observation is that if\u2297 : C \u00d7 V\u2192 V is a left action of a monoidal category C on a category V (one says that V is a left C-module) then one can check that this is the same thing as a monoidal functor F : C\u2192 End(V) where the set End(V) of endofunctors can be viewed as a strict monoidal category with monoidal product the endofunctor composition \u25cb. Here End(V) has monoidal unit id V and its morphisms are natural transformations between endofunctors. F just sends an object X \u2208 C to X \u2297 () as a monoidal functor from V to V. A monoidal functor comes with natural isomorphisms { fX,Y} and these are given tautologically by\nfX,Y(V) : F(X) \u25cb F(Y)(V) = X \u2297 (Y \u2297 V) \u2245 (X \u2297 Y)\u2297 V = F(X \u2297 Y)(V)\nas part of the monoidal action. Conversely, if given a functor F, we define X \u2297 V = F(X)V and extend the monoidal associativity of C to mixed objects using fX,Y to define X \u2297 (Y \u2297 V) = F(X) \u25cb F(Y)V \u2245 F(X \u2297 Y)V = (X \u2297 Y)\u2297 V . The notion of a left module category is a categorification of the bijection between an algebra action \u22c5 : A\u2297 V \u2192 V and a representation as an algebra map A\u2192 End(V). There is an equally good notion of a right C-module category extending \u2297 to V \u00d7 C\u2192 V. In the same way as one uses \u22c5 for both the algebra product and the module action, it is convenient to use \u2297 for both in the categorified version. Similarly for the right module version.\nAnother general observation is that if V is a C-module category for a monoidal category C then Fun C(V, V), the (left exact) functors from V to itself that are compatible with the action of C, is another monoidal category. This is denoted C\u2217V in Ref. 42, but should not be confused with the dual of a monoidal functor which was one of the origins4 of the centre Z(C) construction as a special case. Also note that if A \u2208 C is an algebra in the category then V = A C, the left modules of A in the category, is a right C-module category. If V is an A-module then we define V \u2297 X as the tensor product in C equipped with an A-action from the left on the first factor. Moreover, for certain \u201cnice\u201d right module categories V, there exists a suitable algebra A \u2208 C such that V \u2243 A C, see Ref. 10 (Ref. 42, Theorem 7.10.1) in other conventions. For such module categories, Fun C(V, V) \u2243 A CA the category of A-A-bimodules in C. Here, if given an A-A-bimodule E in C, the corresponding endofunctor is given by E\u2297A (), where we require C to be Abelian so that we can define \u2297A. This turns V \u2208 A C into another A-module in C and E\u2297A (V \u2297 X) \u2245 (E\u2297A V)\u2297 X, so the construction commutes with the right C-action.\nBefore we explain how these abstract ideas lead to K MGK , a more \u201cobvious\u201d case is the study of left module categories for C = G M. If K \u2286 G is a subgroup, we set V = K M for i : K \u2286 G. The functor C\u2192 End(V) just sends X \u2208 C to i\u2217(X)\u2297 () as a functor on V, or more simply V is a left C-module by X \u2297 V = i\u2217(X)\u2297 V . More generally10 (Ref. 42, Example 7.4.9), one can include a cocycle \u03b1 \u2208 H2(K,C\u00d7) since we are only interested in monoidal equivalence, and this data (K,\u03b1) parametrises all indecomposable left G M-module categories. Moreover, here End(V) \u2243 K MK , the category of K-bimodules, where a bimodule E acts by E\u2297CK( ). So the data we need for a G M-module category is a monoidal functor G M \u2192 K MK . This is of potential interest but is not the construction we were looking for.\nRather, we are interested in right module categories of C = MG, the category of G-graded vector spaces. It turns out that these are classified by the exact same data (K,\u03b1) (this is related to the fact that the MG, G M have the same centre) but the construction is different. Thus, if K \u2286 G is a subgroup, we consider A = CK regarded as an algebra in C = MG by \u2223x\u2223 = x viewed in G. One can also twist this by a cocycle \u03b1, but here we stick to the trivial case. Then V = A C = K MG, the category of G-graded left K-modules, is a right C-module category. Explicitly, if X \u2208 C is a G-graded vector space and V \u2208 V a G-graded left K-module then\nV \u2297 X, x.(v \u2297w) = v.x\u2297w, \u2223v \u2297w\u2223 = \u2223v\u2225w\u2223, \u2200 v \u2208 V , w \u2208 X\nis another G-graded left K-module. Finally, by the general theory, there is an associated monoidal category\nC\u2217V \u2236= Fun C(V, V) \u2243 K MGK \u2243 \u039e(R,K)M.\nwhich is the desired category to describe quasiparticles on boundaries in Ref. 9. Conversely, if V is an indecomposable right C-module category for C = MG, it is explained in Ref. 10 (Ref. 42, Example 7.4.10) (in other conventions) that the set of indecomposable objects has a transitive action of G and hence can be identified with G/K for some subgroup K \u2286 G. This can be used to put the module category up to equivalence in the above form (with some cocycle \u03b1)."

            "text": "We have given a detailed account of the algebra behind the treatment of boundaries in the Kitaev model based on subgroups K of a finite group G, as well as how it sits between the abstract categorical picture on the one hand and concrete applications on the other. New results include the quasi-bialgebra \u039e(R, K) in full generality, a more direct derivation from the category K MGK that connects to the module category point of view, a theorem that \u039e(R, K) changes by a Drinfeld twist as R changes, and a \u2217-quasi-Hopf algebra structure that ensures nice properties for the category of representations (these form a strong bar category) and for the standard antipode S. On the computer science side, we edged towards how one might use these ideas in quantum computations and detect quasiparticles across ribbons where one end is on a boundary. We also gave new decomposition formulae relating representations of D(G) in the bulk to those of \u039e(R, K) in the boundary.\nJ. Math.

The case treated here of trivial cocycle \u03b1 is already complicated enough but the ideas do extend to include these and should similarly be worked out. Whereas most of the abstract literature on such matters is at the conceptual level only up to categorical equivalence, we set out to give constructions more explicitly, which we believe is essential for concrete calculations and should also be relevant to the physics. For example, much of the literature on anyons is devoted to so-called F-moves which express the associativity isomorphisms even though, by Mac Lane\u2019s theorem, monoidal categories are equivalent to strict ones. On the physics side, the covariance properties of ribbon operators also involve the coproduct and hence how they are realised depends on the choice of R. The same applies to how \u2217 interacts with tensor products, which would be relevant to the unitarity properties of composite systems. Of interest, for example, should be the case of a lattice divided into two parts A, B with a boundary between them and how the entropy of states in the total space relate to those in the subsystem. This is an idea of considerable interest in quantum gravity, but the latter has certain parallels with quantum computing and could be explored concretely using the results of the paper. We also would like to expand further the concrete use of patches and lattice surgery, as we considered only the cases of boundaries with K = {e} and K = G, and only a square geometry. Additionally, it would be useful to know under what conditions the model gives universal quantum computation. While there are broadly similar such ideas in the physics literature, e.g., Ref. 6, we believe our fully explicit treatment will help to take these forward.\nFurther on the algebra side, the Kitaev model generalises easily to replace G by a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra, with some aspects also in the nonsemisimple case.5 The same applies easily enough to at least a quasi-bialgebra associated to an inclusion L \u2286 H of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras43 and to the corresponding module category picture. Ultimately here, it is the nonsemisimple case that is of interest as such Hopf algebras [e.g. of the form of reduced quantum groups uq(g)] generate the categories where anyons as well as TQFT (topological quantum field theory) invariants live. It is also known that by promoting the finite group input of the Kitaev model to a more general semisimple weak Hopf algebra, one can obtain a unitary fusion category in the role of C.44 There remains a lot of work, therefore, to properly connect these theories to computer science and in particular to established methods for quantum circuits. A step here could be braided ZX-calculus,45 although precisely how remains to be developed. These are some directions for further work.\nAUTHOR DECLARATIONS\nConflict of Interest\nThe authors have no conflicts to disclose.\nAuthor Contributions\nAlexander Cowtan: Conceptualization (equal); Investigation (equal); Methodology (equal); Writing \u2013 original draft (equal); Writing \u2013 review & editing (equal).

In this appendix, we show that this does not work due to issues with equivariance, at least when the boundary ribbon operators act in the same way as bulk ribbon operators.\nDefinition A.1.

Here, \u039e(R, K)\u2217 is a coquasi-Hopf algebra, and so has coassociative comultiplication (it is the multiplication which is only quasi-associative). Therefore, we can concatenate the triangles making up the ribbon in any order, and the concatenation above uniquely defines Yr\u2297\u03b4k\u03be for any ribbon \u03be.\nLet s0 = (v0, p0) and s1 = (v1, p1) be the sites at the start and end of a triangle.

IV A, we described nonabelian lattice surgery for a general underlying group algebra CG, but for simplicity of exposition we assumed that the projectors A(v) and B(p) could be applied deterministically.

We demonstrate on the same example as previously:\nJ. Math.

In this case, we appeal to e.g. Refs. 46 and 47, which claim that one can modify these quasiparticles deterministically using ribbon operators and quantum circuitry. The procedure should be similar to initialising a fresh patch in the zero logical state, but we do not give any details ourselves.

            "text": "Although we have seen in Lemma 5.7 that \u039e(R, K) has a \u2217-algebra that commutes with the coalgebra, this is a very special feature and not something one can impose as a general axiom for a \u2217-quasi-Hopf algebra. This is because when there is a nontrivial associator \u03d5 then coassociativity holds only up to conjugation and hence the properties of \u2217 will normally also need to be modified up to a conjugation, i.e. hold in a weak sense. The correct notion of a \u2217-quasi-Hopf algebra H, like the quasi-coassociativity axiom, comes from the monoidal category structure, now equipped with a functorial complex conjugation as a bar category (Ref. 48, Definition 3.16). Note that the usual notion of a \u2020 or C\u2217-category in computer science captures the notion of adjoints, rather than conjugation, and does not describe the behaviour under tensor products well in our case, as the tensor product of representations is only associative up to a non-trivial isomorphism. This is quite a subtle point - on the other hand, a practical consequence is Proposition 5.9, for which this appendix therefore provides a proof.\nThe natural axioms here at least for a \u2217-quasi-bialgebra, fixing a typo in Ref. 48, Definition 3.16, involve an additional map \u03b8 obeying the first three of:\n(1) an antilinear algebra map \u03b8 : H \u2192 H; (2) an invertible element \u03b3 \u2208 H such that \u03b8(\u03b3) = \u03b3 and \u03b82 = \u03b3()\u03b3\u22121; (3) an invertible element G \u2208 H \u2297H such that\n\u0394\u03b8 = G\u22121(\u03b8\u2297 \u03b8)(\u0394op( ))G, (\u03f5\u2297 id)(G) = (id\u2297 \u03f5)(G) = 1, (C1)\n(\u03b8\u2297 \u03b8\u2297 \u03b8)(\u03d5321)(1\u2297 G)((id\u2297 \u0394)G)\u03d5 = (G\u2297 1)((\u0394\u2297 id)G).

(C1)\u2013(C3) hold for \u039e(R, K) with\nG =\u2211 s,t \u03b4tR\u03c4(s, t)\n\u22121 \u2297 \u03b4sR\u03c4(t, t R)(\u03c4(s, t) \u25c3 tR)\u22121,\nG\u22121 =\u2211 s,t \u03c4(s, t)\u03b4tR \u2297 (\u03c4(s, t) \u25c3 t R)\u03c4(t, tR)\u22121\u03b4sR.\nProof. The proof that G, G\u22121 are indeed inverse is straightforward on matching the \u03b4-functions to fix the summation variables in G\u22121 in terms of G. This then comes down to proving that the map (s, t)\u2192 (p, q) \u2236= (\u03c4(s, t) \u22b3 tR, \u03c4\u2032(s, t) \u22b3 sR) is injective. Indeed, the map (p, q)\u21a6 (p, p \u22c5 q) is injective by left division, so it\u2019s enough to prove that\n(s, t)\u21a6 (p, p \u22c5 q) = (\u03c4(s, t) \u25b9 tR, \u03c4(s, t) \u25b9 (tR \u22c5 \u03c4(t, tR)\u22121 \u25b9 sR)) = ((s \u22c5 t)/s, (s \u22c5 t)R)\nis injective. We used (s \u22c5 t) \u22c5 \u03c4(s, t) \u22b3 tR = s \u22c5 (t \u22c5 tR) = s by quasi-associativity to recognise p, recognised tR \u22c5 \u03c4(t, tR)\u22121 \u25b9 sR = t/sR from (15) and then\n(s \u22c5 t) \u22c5 \u03c4(s, t) \u25b9 (t/sR) = s \u22c5 (t \u22c5 (t/sR)) = s \u22c5 sR = e\nto recognise p \u22c5 q. That the desired map is injective is then immediate by ( )R injective and elementary properties of division. We use similar methods in the other proofs. Thus, writing\n\u03c4\u2032(s, t) \u2236= (\u03c4(s, t) \u25c3 tR)\u03c4(t, tR)\u22121 = \u03c4(s \u22c5 t, \u03c4(s, t) \u25b9 tR)\u22121\nfor brevity, we have\nG\u22121(\u03b8\u2297 \u03b8)(\u0394op\u03b4r) = G\u22121\u2211 p\u22c5q=r (\u03b4qR \u2297 \u03b4pR) =\u2211 s\u22c5t=r \u03c4(s, t)\u03b4tR \u2297 \u03c4 \u2032(s, t)\u03b4sR ,\n(\u0394\u03b8(\u03b4r))G\u22121 = \u2211 p\u22c5q=rR (\u03b4p \u2297 \u03b4q)G\u22121 = \u2211 p\u22c5q=rR \u03c4(s, t)\u03b4tR \u2297 \u03c4 \u2032(s, t)\u03b4sR ,\nwhere in the second line, commuting the \u03b4tR and \u03b4sR to the left sets p = \u03c4(s, t) \u22b3 t R, q = \u03c4\u2032(s, t) \u22b3 sR as studied above. Hence p \u22c5 q = rR in the sum is the same as s \u22c5 t = r, so the two sides are equal and we have proven (C1) on \u03b4r . Similarly,\nG\u22121(\u03b8\u2297 \u03b8)(\u0394opx) = \u2211 p,q,s,t (\u03c4(p, q)\u03b4qR \u2297 (\u03c4(p, q) \u25c3 q R)\u03c4(q, qR)\u22121\u03b4pR)((x \u25c3 s) \u25c3 t \u03b4tR \u2297 \u03b4(x\u25b9s)R x \u25c3 s)\n=\u2211 s,t (x \u25c3 s \u22c5 t)\u03c4(s, t)\u03b4tR \u2297 \u03c4(x \u25b9 (s \u22c5 t), (x \u25c3 s \u22c5 t)\u03c4(s, t) \u25b9 t\nR)\u22121(x \u25c3 s)\u03b4sR\nwhere we first note that for the \u03b4-functions to connect, we need\nJ.

In this case\n\u03c4(p, q)((x \u25c3 s) \u25c3 t) = \u03c4(x \u25b9 s, (x \u25c3 s) \u25b9 t)((x \u25c3 s) \u25c3 t) = (x \u25c3 s \u22c5 t)\u03c4(s, t)\nby the cocycle axiom. Similarly, (x \u22b2 s)\u22121 \u22b3 (x \u22b3 s)R = sR by Lemma 5.4 gives us \u03b4sR . For its coefficient, note that p \u22c5 q = (x \u22b3 s) \u22c5 ((x \u22b2 s) \u22b3 t) = x \u22b3 (s \u22c5 t) so that, using the other form of \u03c4\u2032(p \u22c5 q), we obtain\n\u03c4(p \u22c5 q, \u03c4(p, q) \u25b9 qR)\u22121(x \u25c3 s) = \u03c4(x \u25b9 (s \u22c5 t), \u03c4(p, q)((x \u25c3 s) \u25c3 t) \u25b9 tR)\u22121(x \u25c3 s)\nand we use our previous calculation to put this in terms of s, t. On the other side, we have\n(\u0394\u03b8(x))G\u22121 =\u2211 t \u0394(x \u25c3 t \u03b4tR)G \u22121\n= \u2211 p,q,s\u22c5r=tR\nx \u25c3 t \u03b4s\u03c4(p, q)\u03b4qR \u2297 (x \u25c3 t) \u25c3 r \u03b4r\u03c4(p \u22c5 q, \u03c4(p, q) \u25b9 q R)\u22121\u03b4pR\n=\u2211 p,q\nx \u25c3 (p \u22c5 q) \u03c4(p, q)\u03b4qR \u2297 (x \u25c3 p \u22c5 q) \u25c3 s \u03c4(p \u22c5 q, s) \u22121\u03b4pR ,\nwhere, for the \u03b4-functions to connect, we need\ns = \u03c4(p, q) \u25b9 qR, r = \u03c4\u2032(p, q) \u25b9 pR.\nThe map (p, q)\u21a6 (s, r) has the same structure as the one we studied above but applied now to p, q in place of s, t. It follows that s \u22c5 r = (p \u22c5 q)R and hence this being equal tR is equivalent to p \u22c5 q = t. Taking this for the value of t, we obtain the second expression for (\u0394\u03b8(x))G\u22121.\nWe now use the identity for (x \u22b2 p \u22c5 q) \u22b2 s and (p \u22c5 q) \u22c5 \u03c4(p, q) \u22b3 qR = p \u22c5 (q \u22c5 qR) = p to obtain the same as we obtained for G\u22121(\u03b8\u2297 \u03b8)(\u0394opx) on x, upon renaming s, t there to p, q. The proofs of (C2) and (C3) are similarly quite involved, but omitted given that it is known that the category of modules is a strong bar category. \u25fb\nThe key property of any quasi-bialgebra is that its category of modules is monoidal with associator \u03d5V ,W,U : (V \u2297W)\u2297U \u2192 V \u2297 (W \u2297U) given by the action of \u03d5. In the \u2217-quasi case, this becomes a bar category as follows.48 First, there is a functor bar from the category to itself which sends a module V to a \u201cconjugate,\u201d V\u0304 . In our case, this has the same set and abelian group structure as V but \u03bb.v\u0304 = \u03bb\u0304v for all \u03bb \u2208 C, i.e. a conjugate action of the field, where we write v \u2208 V as v\u0304 when viewed in V\u0304 . Similarly,\n\u03be.v\u0304 = \u03b8(\u03be).v\nfor all \u03be \u2208 \u039e(R, K). On morphisms \u03c8 : V \u2192W, we define \u03c8\u0304 : V\u0304 \u2192 W\u0304 by \u03c8\u0304(v\u0304) = \u03c8(v). Next, there is a natural isomorphism \u03a5 : bar \u25cb \u2297 \u21d2 \u2297op \u25cb (bar \u00d7 bar), given in our case for all modules V , W by\n\u03a5V ,W : V \u2297W \u2245 W\u0304 \u2297 V\u0304 , \u03a5V ,W(v \u2297w) = G2.w \u2297 G1.v\nand making a hexagon identity with the associator, namely\n(id\u2297 \u03a5V ,W) \u25cb \u03a5V\u2297W,U = \u03d5U\u0304,W\u0304,V\u0304 \u25cb (\u03a5W,U \u2297 id) \u25cb \u03a5V ,W\u2297U \u25cb \u03d5V ,W,U.\nWe also have a natural isomorphism bb : id\u21d2 bar \u25cb bar, given in our case for all modules V by\nbbV : V \u2192 V , bbV(v) = \u03b3.v\nand obeying bbV = bbV\u0304 . In our case, we have a strong bar category, which means also\n\u03a5W\u0304,V\u0304 \u25cb \u03a5V ,W \u25cb bbV\u2297W = bbV \u2297 bbW.\nJ. Math. Phys. 64, 102203 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0127285 64, 102203-57\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n19 January 2024 00:40:35\nFinally, a bar category has some conditions on the unit object 1, which in our case is the trivial representation with these automatic. That G = RK leads to a strong bar category is in Ref. 48, Proposition 3.21 but without the underlying \u2217-quasi-Hopf algebra structure as found above.\nNow take the standard antipode S in Theorem 5.8 and \u03b8 constructed above. It is easy to check that\n\u2217Sx = \u2217(\u2211 s \u03b4(x\u22121\u25b9s)R x \u22121 \u25c3 s) =\u2211 s (x\u22121 \u25c3 s)\u22121\u03b4(x\u22121\u25b9s)R =\u2211 s\u2032 x \u25c3 s\u2032\u03b4s\u2032R = \u03b8(x),\nwhere s\u2032 = x\u22121 \u22b3 s and we used Lemma 5.4. We also have \u2217S\u03b4s = \u03b4sR = \u03b8(\u03b4s), so the implicit the standard S recovers the standard \u2217-structure used in the main body of the paper from \u03b8. It is also immediate from the above formula for \u03b3, G that \u03b3\u2217 = \u03b3\u22121 and G\u2217\u2297\u2217 = G\u22121 as claimed in Proposition 5.9. Using these facts and Lemma 5.7, on applying \u2217 to both sides, the properties of the \u2217-quasi bialgebra proven above immediately become the remaining antipode stated in Proposition 5.9, completing its proof."
