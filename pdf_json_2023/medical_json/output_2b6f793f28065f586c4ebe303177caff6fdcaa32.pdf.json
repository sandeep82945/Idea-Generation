    "abstractText": "Although pesticides are often discharged into surface waters in pulses as opposed to a sustained release, the effect of episodic pollution events on freshwater crayfish is largely unknown. We monitored change in heart rate and distance moved to assess the response of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus to short-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of metazachlor (MTZ), terbuthylazine (TER), and thiacloprid (TCL). Crayfish exposed to 20 \u03bcg/L of MTZ exhibited a significant increase in mean heart rate and distance moved. Increased heart rate was detected at 118 \u00b1 74 s post-exposure to MTZ. There were no significant differences in mean heart rate and distance moved in crayfish exposed to 6 \u03bcg/L of TCL and 4 \u03bcg/L of TER. A significant correlation between heart rate and distance moved was found in all exposed groups. These results suggest that pulse exposure to MTZ impact crayfish physiology and behavior during short-term period. With pulse exposure to TCL and TER, crayfish not exhibiting a locomotor response may continue to be exposed to lower, but potentially harmful, levels of pollutants. Evidence of the impacts of pesticide pulse at environmentally relevant concentrations on crayfish is scarce. Further study is required to determine the ecological effects of such events on freshwater crayfish.",

            "text": "Runoff of contaminants from agricultural land into aquatic ecosystems has long been a concern (Gao et\u00a0al. 2008; Matin et\u00a0al. 1998; Palma et\u00a0al. 2014; Wan et\u00a0al. 2021), and the impact has accelerated with the expansion of cultivated areas and accompanying increase in the application of agrochemicals (Benbrook 2016; Dobrovolski et\u00a0al. 2001; Oerke 2006). Numerous studies provide evidence of pesticide residues in surface waters worldwide (De Geronimo et\u00a0al. 2014; Herrero-Hernandez et\u00a0al. 2020; Jergentz et\u00a0al. 2005; Papadakis et\u00a0al. 2018) with concentrations often exceeding the safety levels (Jergentz et\u00a0al. 2005; Papadakis et\u00a0al.\n2018). Agricultural activities have been shown to induce significant adverse effects on non-target species, including crayfish (Bunzel et\u00a0al. 2015; Rosi-Marshall et\u00a0al. 2007; Sohn et\u00a0al. 2018; Stara et\u00a0al. 2019). Exposure to pesticides can result in behavioral, biochemical, and histological alterations in freshwater crayfish (Sohn et\u00a0al. 2018; Stara et\u00a0al. 2019).\nMetazachlor [2-chloro-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(1Hpyrazol-1-ylmethyl)-acetamide] is a chloroacetamide herbicide (FAO 1999), with endocrine disruption as mode of action (Kralova et\u00a0al. 2015). Thiacloprid {3-[(6-chloropyridin-3-yl) methyl]-1,3-thiazolidin-2-ylidene} cyanamide is a neurotoxic neonicotinoid insecticide (EPA 2003). Terbuthylazine [N2-tert-butyl-6-chloro-N4-ethyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine] is a triazine herbicide (EFSA 2011) that can cause endocrine disruption (Ghisari et\u00a0 al. 2015). These pesticides are widely used in Central Europe (Hvezdova et\u00a0al. 2018; Spitzer et\u00a0al. 2020) and they have been reported in European surface waters (Table\u00a01). Moreover, these pesticides have been found to negatively impact aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates at environmentally relevant concentrations (Guo et\u00a0al. 2021; Gutierrez et\u00a0al. 2019; Velisek and Stara 2018). Studies show that metazachlor induced changes in Responsible Editor: Bruno Nunes * Viktoriia Malinovska vmalinovska@frov.jcu.cz 1 Faculty of\u00a0Fisheries and\u00a0Protection of\u00a0Waters, South Bohemian Research Center of\u00a0Aquaculture and\u00a0Biodiversity of\u00a0Hydrocenoses, University of\u00a0South Bohemia in\u00a0Ceske Budejovice, Zatisi 728/II, 389\u00a025\u00a0Vodnany, Czech\u00a0Republic\n1 3\ncrayfish borrowing behavior and locomotor activity (Guo et\u00a0al. 2021; Velisek et\u00a0al. 2020). Zebrafish embryos exposed to thiacloprid exhibited altered avoidance and edge preference behaviors (Xie et\u00a0al. 2022).\nAmong freshwater invertebrates, crayfish are considered keystone species because of their ecological and functional importance (Momot 1995). They can play a valuable role in monitoring environmental pollution through behavioral and physiological alterations and contaminant accumulation (Faria et\u00a0al. 2010; Gago-Tinoco et\u00a0al. 2014; Reisinger et\u00a0al. 2021; Sohn et\u00a0al. 2018). Non-native crayfishes are mostly used in toxicological studies due to the protected status of indigenous species (Buric et\u00a0al. 2013; Velisek et\u00a0al. 2020). Styrishave et\u00a0al. (2007) found no differences in oxygen consumption and heart rate between native noble crayfish Astacus astacus and non-native signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus. Such similarities can help to understand potential impacts on native crayfish populations, using the data from investigations with non-native species. Like many aquatic organisms, crayfish absorb chemicals from water through gills and the body surface in addition to ingesting pollutants along with prey (Katagi 2010). Crayfish are exposed to accumulated contaminants through contact with bottom sediments (Alcorlo et\u00a0al. 2006) and are affected by pollutants, including pesticides, present in surface waters (GagoTinoco et\u00a0al. 2014; Marcal et\u00a0al. 2020; Sohn et\u00a0al. 2018).\nPesticide concentrations in aquatic ecosystems increase with surface runoff (Liess et\u00a0al. 1999) which is often episodic (Thurman et\u00a0al. 1991), with concentrations varying depending on the time of application and precipitation events (Albanis et\u00a0al. 1998). The majority of research into pesticide effects on crayfish focus on chronic exposure and show changes in crayfish antioxidant levels, histology, and behavior (Guo et\u00a0al. 2021; Stara et\u00a0al. 2020; Velisek et\u00a0al. 2020). The response of crayfish to acute exposure to pesticides remains unclear. Since pulse exposure to pesticides has been reported to affect macroinvertebrates (Heckmann and Friberg 2005), it is important to know whether short-term pulses of agrochemicals adversely affect prime players in the freshwater environment, such as crayfish.\nThe objective of the present study was to quantify the acute response of the signal crayfish P. leniusculus to a brief pulse of metazachlor, terbuthylazine, or thiacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations, as assessed by cardiac and locomotor activity. Crayfish have been known to exhibit alterations in cardiac and locomotor activity as responses to a wide variety of environmental stressors (Bini et\u00a0al. 2015; Kuklina et\u00a0al. 2014; Lozek et\u00a0al. 2019; Velisek et\u00a0al. 2020). In this study, changes in heart rate and distance moved were monitored to gain information of crayfish response to acute pesticide exposure."

The pesticides were each represented in a separate run. Each phase included 12 experimental crayfish: six exposed and six control specimens (3:3 male:female). Each of the three pesticide groups thus had its own control group. Heart rate was recorded using a non-invasive crayfish cardiac activity monitoring system (Pautsina et\u00a0al. 2014). Briefly, this system consists of infrared (IR) sensors, a multichannel analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with USB interface, and a personal computer for data processing. The IR sensors were attached to the dorsal side of crayfish carapace above the heart with non-toxic epoxy glue. Wires that connect sensors and the ADC are flexible and allow crayfish to move freely. Heart rate was measured every second and then recorded as number of beats per minute (bpm).\nTo record movement, a Microsoft Kinect Sensor (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) was placed under the tanks. Distance moved (cm) was measured every second and evaluated using a multiple-arena module in EthoVision XT 13.0 software (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands).\nEach crayfish with attached IR sensor was placed into separate non-recirculating 6-L tank (water temperature 20.3\u201321.5\u00a0 \u00b0C, pH 7.6\u20137.8, dissolved oxygen 8.49\u20138.76\u00a0mg/L, 12:12-h light:dark cycle) for 10\u00a0days of\nacclimation and experimentation. The length of the tank wall was 30\u00a0cm and the width was 19\u00a0cm. The water depth in the tank was 11\u00a0cm. Twice weekly, chironomid larvae were provided and water was changed. Tanks were aerated to avoid disturbance to crayfish during pesticide application and to ensure rapid diffusion of the pesticide throughout the water. Plastic mesh was used as a substrate to provide crayfish with traction when moving. Three trials were conducted as follows: pesticide was administered to tanks simultaneously using individual peristaltic pumps. The compound is uniformly mixed in the tank during 30\u00a0s as authors tested prior to the experiment with colored liquid. Crayfish from the control group received dechlorinated tap water the same temperature as in experimental tanks. Crayfish heart rate and locomotor activity were recorded for 10\u00a0min before and 10\u00a0min after adding the pesticide. Therefore, crayfish were exposed to the pesticides for 10\u00a0min. Following the experiment, all crayfish were euthanized humanely by freezing at \u2212 20\u00a0\u00b0C."

            "text": "As episodic spikes in chemical concentration are more typical of agricultural areas than a sustained release (Liess et\u00a0al. 1999; Liess and Von der Ohe 2009), we quantified crayfish acute cardiac and locomotor responses to environmentally relevant pesticide concentrations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report crayfish reaction to pulse exposure of pesticides in water.\nA single exposure to chemicals at relatively high, but environmentally relevant, concentrations usually provokes detectable physiological or behavior changes (Beketov and Liess 2005, 2008a). With repeated exposure, macroinvertebrates exhibit a stronger response, possibly related to incomplete recovery from previous exposure (Berghahn et\u00a0al. 2012; Mohr et\u00a0al. 2012). Animals are often impacted by multiple simultaneous stressors, the effect of which depends on ambient physical and chemical parameters. The amphipod crustacean Gammarus pulex from contaminated streams was shown to be more sensitive to pesticide exposure than animals from an uncontaminated environment (Russo et\u00a0al. 2018). Crayfish for the current experiment were obtained from a non-polluted ecosystem and acclimated to laboratory conditions for a prolonged time, so may have been less sensitive to the exposure.\nWith exposure to metazachlor, we detected significant changes in crayfish distance moved. An increase in locomotor activity can be the result of stimulatory effect of\nmetazachlor. Previous studies have reported that pesticides can exhibit stimulatory effects in non-target organisms (Cutler et\u00a0al. 2022; Guedes et\u00a0al. 2009; Morse 1998) resulting in behavioral alterations in pesticide-exposed vertebrates and invertebrates (Deng et\u00a0al. 2009; DuRant et\u00a0al. 2007). Chemical irritation is often associated with stimulation of locomotor responses in aquatic organisms (Chen et\u00a0al. 2014; Sharma 2019). The increased distance moved after exposure may also have represented active avoidance of the contaminated area. Velisek et\u00a0al. (2019) documented an increase in distance moved in juvenile crayfish Procambarus virginalis exposed to the pesticide S-metolachlor. Buric et\u00a0al. (2013) described attempts of crayfish Faxonius limosus and Pacifastacus leniusculus to escape exposure to the pesticide diazinon. Moreover, it has been reported that brief pesticide exposure can induce drift (Beketov and Liess 2008a) or increase drift density of a macroinvertebrate community (Heckmann and Friberg 2005). Sensitivity of ecosystem function and invertebrate population dynamics to environmental contaminants have been shown in several studies (Berenzen et\u00a0al. 2005; Martin et\u00a0al. 2011; Richmond et\u00a0al. 2016, 2019). Drift of macroinvertebrates, driven by irritable or avoidance behavior, may lead to risks associated with predation, community structure alterations, decrease in abundance, and, consequently, affect the food chain.\nDisorientation of crayfish in the presence of pesticides could be the result of temporary impairment of olfactory receptors (Cook and Moore 2008). Disruption of\n1 3\nchemoreception can affect agonistic, feeding, and homing behavior, with juvenile crayfish potentially more sensitive to the impact of pesticides (Buric et\u00a0al. 2013). The latter might partially explain the lack of reaction of some individuals in our study, since we examined adult crayfish. Metazachlor is an endocrine-disrupting agent that, among other effects, adversely impacts behavior and metabolism (Crisp et\u00a0al. 1998). Increased cardiac and locomotor activity provides evidence of behavioral and metabolic disturbances in response to pesticide presence.\nWe did not observe significant changes in locomotor activity of crayfish exposed to terbuthylazine and thiacloprid at 4 and 6\u00a0\u03bcg/L, respectively, suggesting that, with such pesticide pulse, the majority of crayfish might not be stimulated to escape a contaminated area. This can lead to continuing exposure, as pesticide concentrations decrease over time (Ulrich et\u00a0al. 2018). Concentrations as low as 0.5\u20131\u00a0\u03bcg/L of thiacloprid during a 96-h exposure were shown to adversely influence the predation activity of the aquatic invertebrate Gammarus fossarum (Englert et\u00a0al. 2012). It is noteworthy that crayfish species may vary in level of sensitivity to a given substance. Buric et\u00a0al. (2013) reported P. leniusculus to be less sensitive to diazinon treatment than was F. limosus. Species other than signal crayfish may exhibit greater physiological and behavior responses to terbuthylazine and thiacloprid at the tested concentrations. The low number of specimens reacting to thiacloprid might be connected with its mode of action. Like other neonicotinoids, thiacloprid stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system. While low activation of these receptors can manifest as nervous excitation, higher levels of thiacloprid can cause overexcitation and block the receptors, resulting in temporary paralysis (Yamamoto 1999), which may become more apparent with a longer exposure period.\nIn our experiment, changes in heart rate coincided with an increase in distance moved. This is in agreement with Kuklina et\u00a0al. (2018), who demonstrated initiation of Pontastacus leptodactylus crayfish locomotion to coincide with heart rate increase as a reaction to chemical stimuli. With natural stimuli such as predator or conspecific crayfish odor, locomotion was delayed or was not manifested. Change in cardiac activity, in particular increased heart rate, is a typical stress response of crayfish to substances in water. This was demonstrated in studies of chemicals such as disinfectants, metals, and pharmaceuticals (Kuklina et\u00a0al. 2014; Bini et\u00a0al. 2015; Lozek et\u00a0al. 2019). The cardiac response of P. leniusculus to tested pesticides confirms its potential to be used as a bioindicator of aquatic contamination by pesticides.\nWhile we investigated the response of crayfish to an acute pulse of pesticide, some adverse effects might remain following the exposure. Evidence of impacts on survival and reproduction of G. pulex was detected for at least 2\u00a0weeks following a short pulse of the pyrethroid\ninsecticide esfenvalerate at an environmentally relevant concentration (Cold and Forbes 2004). A single contamination event by thiacloprid can show effects on abundance and community structure of aquatic invertebrates after 7\u00a0days (Beketov et\u00a0al. 2008) and, in community parameters, after 3\u00a0months (Liess and Beketov 2011). Delayed lethal and sublethal effects occurred in several freshwater crustacean species following a single thiacloprid exposure at a concentration of 5.47\u00a0\u00b5g/L (Beketov and Liess 2008b)."

Acute exposure to metazachlor at an environmentally relevant concentration can induce changes in crayfish heart rate and locomotor activity. With pulse exposure to terbuthylazine, and thiacloprid, the majority of animals might not respond to contaminants during short-term period. Owing to the prime role of crayfish in freshwater environment, the knowledge of how pesticides at environmentally relevant concentrations impact these crustaceans is of key importance. Spikes in pesticide concentrations are typical of aquatic environments, and further studies of the effect of a single short-term pesticide exposure on crayfish can reveal crucial information of the ecological consequences of such events.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11356- 023- 25908-7.\nAcknowledgements We thank The Lucidus Consultancy for the language editing.\nAuthor contribution Viktoriia Malinovska: writing \u2014 original draft preparation, writing \u2014 review and editing, investigation, data analysis.
