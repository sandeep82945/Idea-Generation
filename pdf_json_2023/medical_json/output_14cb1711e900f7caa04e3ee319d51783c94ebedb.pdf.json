Accumulating evidence suggests that steroid synthesis inhibitors such as ketoconazole (KTZ) or phthalates may also affect female reproductive health, however their mode of action is poorly understood. Because hypothalamic activity is very sensitive to sex steroids, we aimed at determining whether and how EDCs with different mode of action can alter the hypothalamic transcriptome and GnRH release in female rats.\nDesign: Female rats were exposed to KTZ or DES during perinatal (DES 3-6- 12mg/kg.d; KTZ 3-6-12mg/kg.d), pubertal or adult periods (DES 3-12-48mg/kg.d; KTZ 3-12-48mg/kg.d).\nResults: Ex vivo study of GnRH pulsatility revealed that perinatal exposure to the highest doses of KTZ andDES delayedmaturation ofGnRH secretion before puberty, whereas pubertal or adult exposure had no effect on GnRH pulsatility. Hypothalamic transcriptome, studied by RNAsequencing in the preoptic area and in themediobasal hypothalamus,was found tobevery sensitive toperinatal exposure to all dosesof KTZ before puberty with effects persisting until adulthood. Bioinformatic analysis with IngenuityPathwayAnalysispredicted \u201cCrebsignaling inNeurons\u201dand \u201cIGF-1signaling\u201d among the most downregulated pathways by all doses of KTZ and DES before puberty, and \u201cPPARg\u201d as a common upstream regulator driving gene expression changes.Deeper screeningofRNAseqdatasets indicated that ahighnumberof genes regulatingtheactivityof theextrinsicGnRHpulsegeneratorwereconsistentlyaffected by all the doses ofDES andKTZbefore puberty. Several, includingMKRN3, DNMT3or Cbx7, showed similar alterations in expression at adulthood.\nConclusion: nRH secretion and the hypothalamic transcriptome are highly sensitive to perinatal exposure to both DES and KTZ. The identified pathways should be exploredfurther to identify biomarkers for future testing strategies for EDC identification and when enhancing the current standard information requirements in regulation.\nKEYWORDS\nendocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), hypothalamus, puberty, transcriptome, reproduction\nfrontiersin.org01\nFranssen et al. 10.3389/fendo.2023.1140886"

            "text": "Age distribution of pubertal signs in humans has been changing over the last decades. It is characterized by an extended distribution towards earliness for initial pubertal stages and towards lateness for final pubertal stages (1). This phenomenon is concomitant with an increased incidence rate in reproductive disorders (1, 2). Such rapid trends suggest that environmental factors play a causal role. Indeed, the programming of pubertal maturation and fertility is finely tuned by sex steroids and highly sensitive to environmental factors (3, 4). A growing body of evidence points towards an association between exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and recent changes in pubertal timing or reproductive health (5). While initial studies reported an impact of such environmental factors on male fertility (6), epidemiological data, together with animal models, now indicate that female reproductive health is also sensitive to environmental chemicals (7\u201310). Epidemiological studies reported associations between prenatal or childhood exposure to estrogenic EDCs such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or bisphenol A with early or late puberty in girls (11\u201313). Impaired fecundity or premature menopause have also been reported after exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) (14, 15), PCOS after exposure to bisphenol A (16), and premature ovarian failure after exposure to perfluoroalkyl chemicals (17). Following such observations, initial animal studies focused on modeling effects of developmental and adult exposure to estrogenic EDCs on pubertal development, ovulation, and fertility. Estrogenic EDCs such as DES, bisphenol A and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane have been shown to alter the timing of vaginal opening or first estrus (18\u201322); reviewed in (1) and disrupt the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, ovarian follicle maturation and fertility in rodents (23\u201325). In addition, steroid synthesis inhibitors such as phthalates and the fungicide ketoconazole (KTZ) which are known to alter male reproductive function (26\u201328), have been recently described to impair female reproductive health (29, 30).\nWe recently showed that perinatal exposure to KTZ and DES delays vaginal opening in female rats without affecting bodyweight (21). This opened up the question of possible effects on central regulation of puberty onset. In the present study, we investigate the brain from the same animal litters to explore hypothalamic mechanisms potentially involved in the disruption of puberty. The reproductive organs have long been considered the major target of EDCs, but brain structures such as the hypothalamus, also appear to be highly sensitive to EDCs (31). GnRH neurons regulate all aspects of reproduction through their pattern of release. The secretory activity of GnRH neurons depends on trans-synaptic and glial inputs mediated by neurotransmitters and cell-cell signaling molecules produced in the preoptic area (POA) and the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) (32). New methods have provided more information regarding the transcriptional regulation of the hypothalamic network coordinating reproduction (33\u201335). This tightly organized network controlling GnRH secretion throughout development appears to be exquisitely sensitive to EDCs (10, 36).\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 02\nKTZ is a first-generation antifungal imidazole known to disrupt steroid hormone synthesis by inhibiting various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (37\u201339). Recent data showed that KTZ, at low concentration (0.041-1.2 mM) induced an inhibition of CYP17A1 as it led to an accumulation of progestagens and corticosteroids and a decrease in androgens and estrogens. At higher concentrations, KTZ suppressed all steroids synthesis (40). DES is a synthetic estrogen (41\u201343). Its effects appear to be mediated by ERa as mice deficient in ERa (ERaKO) do not develop genital anomalies observed in wild-type mice after DES exposure (44\u201347). DES activate MAP kinase and PI3K pathways and induce ERK phosphorylation (48, 49).\nAlthough deleterious effects of EDCs on reproductive function are now well recognized, current regulations are still insufficient for identifying windows of sensitivity and effects on female reproductive health (50). Better test methods to identify EDCs are necessary and require a better understanding of modes of action as well as the identification of biomarkers. To address this issue, this study aimed to determine the influence of two EDCs with different modes of action on the hypothalamic transcriptome governing GnRH release."

Because puberty results from the activation of GnRH secretion, this opened up the question of a potential delayed activation of GnRH secretion caused by exposure to DES and KTZ. Pulsatile GnRH secretion from individually incubated hypothalamic explants displays a developmental acceleration between day 5 and day 25, before the onset of puberty (58). Consistently, exposures to EDCs that advance or delay pubertal onset are associated with an acceleration or retardation of GnRH release, respectively (9, 19, 20), indicating the sensitivity of such an assay. We aimed to study the effect of perinatal exposure to KTZ or DES on GnRH secretion on PND22. GnRH interpulse interval (GnRH IPI) was significantly increased by exposure to EDCs (F4,18 = 4.727; p=0.0088). Post hoc analyses indicated that the exposures to 12 \u00b5g/kg/d of DES and 12 mg/kg/d of KTZ significantly increased GnRH interpulse interval at 22 days of age compared to the Control group (p = 0.02 and p = 0.02 respectively; Figure 2A), indicating a delay of the maturation of GnRH secretion. This was consistent with the significant delay in vaginal opening reported in the same animals for all doses of DES or KTZ at 6 mg/kg/d (21).\nTo determine whether the effects of DES and KTZ persisted later in life, we studied GnRH pulsatile release after puberty: at PND42 and during adulthood (diestrus stage) at PND90.

To explore this hypothesis, RNA-seq was performed on MBH or POA total RNA obtained from females at different developmental time points (PND 22, 42 and 90) after perinatal exposure to the three doses of KTZ or DES (5 biological replicates per group).\nIn the MBH, the principal component analysis (PCA plot, Figure 3) indicated that the transcriptional profiles of control and EDC exposed samples were readily distinguishable at specific ages. At PND22, the three doses of KTZ or DES were clearly separated from the control group. The first two components explained 68% of total point variance for KTZ (Figure 3A) and 58% of total variability for DES (Figure 3C). At PND42, there were no clear clustering between EDC samples and control. At PND90, the three groups exposed to KTZ, or the highest dose of DES were clearly separated from the controls (Figure 3A, C).\nWe conducted differential expression analysis with an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05 on each set of raw expression measures. The MBH appeared to be very sensitive to perinatal exposure to DES or KTZ before puberty as the mRNA expression of 1896 hypothalamic genes was significantly affected by all three doses of KTZ (Figure 3B); and 1084 genes by all three doses of DES (Figure 3D) on PND22. On PND 42, 48 genes were affected by all 3 doses of KTZ and 100 genes by the 3 doses of DES. On PND90, 2433 genes are affected by the three doses of KTZ while only the highest dose of DES altered a high number of genes (2496).

In addition, the mRNA expression of other receptors able to modulate reproductive function, such as Ghr, Gpr37, Esrra or Tshr, were also altered in the same direction by all the doses of KTZ and nearly all doses of DES.

To consolidate the study, multiple doses and different windows of exposure were tested. We found that perinatal exposure to KTZ and DES delayed the maturation of GnRH secretion in female rats which is consistent with the delay in vaginal opening we previously reported for the same animals (21). Our results underline the exquisite sensitivity of the mediobasal hypothalamus to developmental exposure to EDCs. In particular, the transcription of crucial actors of the GnRH network was affected by the developmental exposure to both estrogenic and anti-androgenic compounds."

            "text": "We have previously shown that developmental exposure to estrogenic EDCs can disrupt the hypothalamic control of puberty (19, 20, 65). Our hypothalamic incubation model retains the pulsatile characteristics of GnRH secretion which are defined by a physiological acceleration before the onset of puberty (51). This model is thus well suited to detect the central effects of EDCs on GnRH secretion ex vivo. We previously documented that delayed vaginal opening caused by developmental exposure to EDCs can be explained by a slowdown of GnRH pulsatile release before puberty. Exposure to DES at 1 \u00b5g/kg.day during the first 5 postnatal days led to a slower release of GnRH at PND 25 and to delayed vaginal opening (19). The same observation was made after exposure to 25 ng/kg.day of BPA during the first 5 or 15 postnatal days while a higher dose of 5 mg/kg.day accelerated maturation of GnRH secretion and advanced puberty (20). In this study, we observed that perinatal exposure to 12 \u00b5g/kg.day DES and 12 mg/kg.day KTZ slowed down GnRH secretion consistent with the reported delayed vaginal opening (21). The prepubertal period was the most sensitive in detecting the impact of EDCs on GnRH release as the impact of DES and KTZ on GnRH secretion was less pronounced at later ages (PND 42 and 90). This indicates that the mechanisms that trigger the activation of the GnRH pulse generator at puberty onset may be more sensitive to KTZ or DES than the mechanisms maintaining GnRH secretion later in life (66, 67). The activation of GnRH release around puberty results from a loss in trans-synaptic inhibition together with a rise in excitatory input (34). This is explained by a shift in expression of puberty activating and inhibitory genes. Our results suggest that early exposure to KTZ or DES disrupt the shift in expression of key inhibitory or excitatory factors which are responsible for GnRH secretion acceleration at puberty. In addition, our data identified the perinatal period as a critical window of sensitivity, as exposure to DES or KTZ during that period led to an alteration of GnRH pulsatility while pubertal or adult exposures had no impact on GnRH pulse frequency in our model. However, we cannot exclude that such later exposure could\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 13\naffect other parameters such as the amplitude of GnRH pulses ex vivo which is physiologically increased during the afternoon of the proestrus (68)."

            "text": "We show here that a very high number of hypothalamic genes is affected by perinatal exposure to KTZ and DES when studied during the prepubertal period (PND 22). This illustrates the high sensitivity of the hypothalamic transcriptional regulation to EDC exposure. The cell bodies of GnRH neurons are located in the POA. Their projections cross the MBH to end in the median eminence where GnRH is released in a pulsatile manner. Compelling data indicate that the pulse generator is not intrinsic to GnRH neurons, but rather is extrinsic and located within the arcuate nucleus and MBH (32, 67, 69). In our study, the MBH transcriptome appeared more sensitive to KTZ and DES exposure than the POA, as shown by the higher number of DEGs and the broad amplitude of expression changes. KNDy (expressing Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B and Dynorphin) and GABAergic neurons appear to be major actors of the GnRH pulse generator (32, 67, 69). Recent work by Herbison demonstrated that the inhibitory GABAergic signalization on GnRH dendrons requires GABAB receptor and voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC)(70). In our study, the expression of two subunits of GABAB receptor and two subunits of VGCC, Cacna2d3 and Cacng3, are upregulated by all doses of KTZ in the MBH at PND22, which is consistent with a delay in the activation of the extrinsic GnRH pulse generator and slowdown of GnRH pulsatile secretion. The opposite observation is made for the P22 downregulation of Mkrn3, that has been recently demonstrated to prevent puberty initiation, at least in part, by repressing the transcription of the genes coding for Kisspeptin and Neurokinin B (62). Finally, we cannot exclude that the delay in GnRH secretion maturation is due to the disruption of embryonic migration or development of GnRH neurons by DES or KTZ. Igsf10 mutations are associated with abnormal GnRH neuronal migration resulting in delayed puberty (61). Notably, in our study, Igsf10 is downregulated by all doses of KTZ and DES at PND22. Additionally, epigenetic factors driving fgf8-dependent GnRH neuron development such as Dnmt and Ezh2 (71), were downregulated by the developmental exposure to KTZ."

Ingenuity pathway analysis\u00ae(IPA) is a powerful analysis and interpretation tool built on the comprehensive and manually selected content of the QIAGEN Knowledge Base. Using IPA, we identified pathways predicted to be up or down regulated by perinatal exposure to KTZ and DES. At PND 22, the top pathway predicted to be activated by DES and KTZ was \u201cestrogen biosynthesis\u201d. The role of neuroestrogens in the regulation of\nfrontiersin.org\nFranssen et al. 10.3389/fendo.2023.1140886\nGnRH and puberty is still incompletely understood. Terasawa et al. showed that neuroestradiol, locally synthesized in the hypothalamus, could be a component of the central inhibition of GnRH release before puberty in monkeys (72). Estradiol (E2) levels in the median eminence are higher before than during puberty onset when GnRH release begins to increase (73). Because neuroestrogens appear to halt puberty, the activation of this pathway seems consistent with the delay of maturation of GnRH release observed in our model of exposure.\nThe \u201cCreb signaling pathway\u201d was systematically identified as downregulated by the three doses of KTZ in the MBH at PND22 and PND90 and in the POA at PND22. DES exposure similarly led to a downregulation of this pathway in the MBH at PND22. cAMP response element-binding protein (Creb) is a transcription factor which binds to cAMP response element (CRE) of the promoter of its target genes. As illustrated in Supplemental Figure 2, Creb can act as a second messenger upon activation of glutamate receptors, growth factor receptors or an intracellular Ca2+ influx (74, 75). GnRH neurons express Creb which acts as a mediator of E2 negative feedback (76). Creb has already been reported to be a target of anti-androgenic EDC in the hippocampus (77\u201379) and the testes (80).\nThe \u201cIgf\u20101 (insulin-\u2010like growth factor 1) signaling pathway\u201d was another pathway constantly affected by perinatal exposure to KTZ and DES. Igf1 is a metabolic signal activating and enhancing GnRH secretion at the time of puberty 81). IGF1 effect on GnRH neurons is mediated by glial production of PGE2 (81) and by neurokinin B release by KNDys neurons (82). Its expression is sensitive to EDCs, as it is upregulated in the arcuate nucleus after perinatal exposure to BPA or DES (83). Recent data indicates that precocious puberty in female rats following peripubertal exposure to 5 mg/kg/day of DEHP was associated with an upregulation of the hypothalamic Igf-1/Pi3k/Akt/mTor pathway. Inhibition of Igf-1R and mTor prevented the action of DEHP by decreasing Kiss-1, Gpr54, and GnRH expression (84). These reports support Igf1 as an interesting biomarker of EDC impact on the hypothalamic network.\nWe identified Oxt and Avp as potential biomarkers, as they were among the genes most affected by perinatal exposure to KTZ and DES at PND 22 and PND 90. The pathway \u201cOxytocin in brain signaling\u201d was also identified by IPA analyses. Oxytocin appears to play a key role in pubertal onset and ovulation in several species. In rats, oxytocin facilitates female pubertal development through a mechanism involving Pge2 release by glial cell and increases the expression of several actors of the GnRH network including kisspeptin (85\u201387). In fish, studies suggest a modulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis by oxytocin (88). In women, oxytocin is involved in the physiological regulation of LH through the ovulatory cycle (89). Hypothalamic oxytocin appears to be sensitive to EDC exposure. In our previous study, a perinatal exposure to a mixture of estrogenic and anti-androgenic EDCs led to a transgenerational downregulation of OxtmRNA expression in the hypothalamus of prepubertal female rats (65). In the present study, we observed an opposite effect. Oxt was upregulated after both KTZ and DES perinatal exposure. These changes appear to\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 14\ncontradict the delayed maturation of GnRH secretion and puberty. but could be seen as reactive rather than causal as previously seen for BPA effects on hypothalamic expression of enzymes involved in GABA synthesis (20). Thus, Oxt appears as a sensitive target, and a potential biomarker, of developmental exposure to EDCs.\nOur results indicate that PPARg could be one of the upstream regulators driving the changes in gene expression caused by KTZ and DES in the MBH. PPARg is a nuclear receptor and a transcription factor. It regulates the expression of genes responsible for adipocyte differentiation, placental differentiation, lipid and glucose homeostasis, control of inflammatory responses and steroidogenesis (90). PPARg is also expressed by hypothalamic AgRP and NPY neurons which are involved in the control of energy balance in mice and rats (91, 92). Those neurons send projections to GnRH neurons and regulate their activity (reviewed in (93)). One could hypothesize that PPARg expressed by AgRP/NPY neurons could mediate EDC effects on GnRH secretion. However, the role of PPARg as a metabolic sensor regulating GnRH activity remains to be determined. Several studies indicate that PPARg expression and activity are sensitive to EDCs. It has been identified as a major mediator of the obesogenic effects of phthalates or bisphenol A, in adipocytes (94, 95). PPARg is also expressed in the ovary where its activity is induced by mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP)(96) or Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (97). All together, these data suggest that PPARg could also be a potent effector and biomarker of EDC effects on female reproduction and lend further support to a previously developed putative AOP that proposes a PPARg-mediated reduction in aromatase to explain irregular ovarian cycling and impaired fertility in adult females (AOP-Wiki).\nIt should be considered that our transcriptome data were obtained from whole MBH or POA, both of which are made up of various cell populations. Thus, it can be difficult to separate changes to general cellularity (a shift in cell populations) from bona fide changes in gene transcription. This is a prevailing challenge for RNA-seq analysis of heterogenous tissues. Future studies including single-cell RNA-seq could be used to identify specific cell populations sensitive to EDC exposure by deconvolution approaches. Nevertheless, our data suggests that a large proportion of DEGs represent changes in transcription, as we did not observe any obvious trend of all (or most) genes specific to certain cell types were moving in one direction; either up- or down-regulated."

            "text": "KTZ is mostly known to inhibit various P450 cytochrome enzymes involved in steroidogenesis and thereby interfering with both androgen and estrogen synthesis (39, 40). However, the role and expression of aromatase in the brain during puberty onset has been poorly studied. Aromatase (Cyp19a1) mRNA expression in the hypothalamus is very low during the infantile period (98, 99) and almost undetectable in the POA at P21 (100). Recent studies using\nfrontiersin.org\nFranssen et al. 10.3389/fendo.2023.1140886\nmodified mice where EGFP transcription is coupled to the physiological activation of Cyp19A1, show that aromatase is well expressed in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus during embryonic life (101) and during adulthood (102). However, infantile, and pubertal periods have not been studied with this technology. This suggests that KTZ exposure during gestation and lactation could impact aromatase transcription or activity during the embryonic period. During this period, aromatase plays a crucial role in sexual differentiation of the brain. The classical view of brain sexual differentiation in mammals holds that sex differences mostly depend on the production of testosterone by the testes (103). Depending on the species, some of the effects of testosterone result from the action of estradiol derived from aromatization of testosterone locally in the male brain. For this reason, any compound which interferes with estrogen-dependent processes, as estrogenic or anti-androgenic compounds, in the developing brain can disrupt the sexual differentiation and consequently also the programming of puberty and reproductive function. Thus, we cannot exclude that the hypothalamic disruption is indirect and due to an altered release of peripheral steroids as KTZ can inhibit steroidogenic P450 enzymes in the adrenal cortex (104, 105) and gonads (105, 106). A recent review also reported that azole fungicides may affect all levels of the hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal & gonadal axes in fish (107)."
