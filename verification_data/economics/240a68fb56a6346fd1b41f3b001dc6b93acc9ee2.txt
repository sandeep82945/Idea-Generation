"To our knowledge, this is the first study to be conducted on catastrophic OPS on general and dental health services in Spain, disaggregated by regions. In 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Health announced a proposal to expand the coverage of the common portfolio of the Spanish NHS services with respect to dental care services, with special attention to the following groups: children and adolescents, pregnant women, people with disabilities, the elderly and vulnerable populations. The main objective of this reform is to increase the coverage of healthcare benefits, through better intersectoral coordination, transversality and the introduction of new technologies. The cost of this proposal is expected to be 45.6 million euros [37]. According to the proposal, new policies in this area should be applied in two ways. On the one hand, as most dental spending concerns restorative work, more effort is needed on policies to promote oral health and to prevent disease, especially in the early stages of life (childhood and youth stages), fostering not only healthy nutrition, but also good habits of oral health. Appropriate interventions in primary and secondary schools such as awareness campaigns, the public provision (or subsidy) of dental care resources (toothbrushes, toothpaste, fluoridisation, etc.) and the design of health-focused diets would enhance nutritional education and help prevent dental diseases, both direct and indirect. In addition, public policies should focus oral health reviews on people in situations of financial vulnerability, who are otherwise less likely to seek dental treatment [12]."
