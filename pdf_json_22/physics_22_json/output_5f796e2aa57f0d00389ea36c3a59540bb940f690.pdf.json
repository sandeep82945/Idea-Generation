It is believed that these outflows could play an mportant role in the central black hole growth, the host galaxy volution (Ostriker et al. 2010 ; Kormendy & Ho 2013 ) and the hemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Detailed nvestigation of the time variability of BAL profiles is important to btain tight constraints on the BAL lifetime, location of the outflow tc., and provide significant insights on the origin and physical echanisms driving the flow. BAL variability includes extreme ptical depth variations like emergence, disappearance and kinematic hift of BALs (Filiz Ak et al. 2013 ; McGraw et al. 2017 ; De Cicco t al. 2018 ; Rogerson et al. 2018 ; Vivek, Srianand & Dawson 2018 ). ossible origins of BAL variability include : (i) large variations n quasar ionizing flux, (ii) changes in co v ering factor ( f c ) of the utflow with respect to the central source, (iii) transverse motion of he outflow perpendicular to our line of sight.\nIn recent years, using the Southern African Large Telescope SALT), we started to investigate the time variability of a sample of 2 quasars from SDSS DR15 (P \u0302 aris et al. 2017 ) which show BALs t outflow velocities greater than 15 000 km s \u22121 in their spectra\nE-mail: aromal@iucaa.in (PA); anand@iucaa.in (RS); ppetitje@iap.fr (PP)\nd S\n2022 The Author(s) ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\ncorresponding to Ultra Fast Outflows, UFOs). This monitoring rogramme has revealed several interesting BAL quasars. In Aromal, rianand & Petitjean ( 2021 ), we presented a detailed analysis f J162122.54 + 075808.4, that shows emergence and acceleration ignatures of new BAL components at large velocity. In this paper, e present a detailed analysis of another interesting BAL QSO J132216.25 + 052446.3, hereafter denoted as J1322 + 0524) for he following reasons: (i) presence of a broad absorption component onsisting of multiple narrow absorption features that are separated oughly by C IV doublet splitting. Such a signature (usually referred o as \u2018line-locking\u2019) is considered as an evidence for line-driven cceleration in disc wind models. (ii) Emergence of a very high veocity flow (with ejection velocity in the range 15 000\u201328 000 km s \u22121 ) evealed by C IV and N V absorption. Absorption with such large elocities and spread are expected in standard disc-wind models. hus this component could represent a newly ejected material from he accretion disc in contrast to transverse motion of clouds usually nvoked to understand newly emerged absorption. (iii) Availability f ten epochs of spectroscopic monitoring data spreading o v er 19 yr nd good photometric co v erage in ZTF o v er the last 5 epochs (with t least one spectrum per year) provides a possibility to constrain ifferent time-scales related to this BAL quasar. (iv) Presence of an pparent correlated variability between different broad absorption omponents and C IV broad emission line (BEL).\nThe paper is organized as follows.

We probe the possible correlations in the ariability of the C IV rest equivalent widths of the different BAL omponents and the C IV BEL. In Section 4 , we study the long-term est UV continuum flux variability of J1322 + 0524 using all the vailable spectra and photometric light-curves. We also study the ossible correlation between the C IV rest equi v alent width and the est frame near-UV (NUV) continuum variabilities. In Section 5 , we iscuss our results in the framework of simple photoionization and isc-wind model predictions. We summarize our main findings in ection 6 . OBSERVATIONS & DATA USED IN THIS TUDY pectra of J1322 + 0524 were obtained during three epochs in he SDSS/BOSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey/ Baryon Oscillation pectroscopic Surv e y) surv e y. F or more than six years since the ear 2015, we have been carrying out spectroscopic monitoring of 1322 + 0524 using the SALT (Buckley et al. 2005 ). Details of all he available spectra are summarized in Table 1 . We used the Robert tobie Spectrograph (RSS, Burgh et al. 2003 ; Kobulnicky et al. 2003 ) t SALT in the long-slit mode using a 1.5 arcsec wide slit and the G0900 grating (kept at a position angle, PA = 0.0 for epochs 4, 5, nd 7, PA = 85.0 for epoch 6 and PA = 80.0 for epochs 8, 9, and 10). ith GR angle = 12.5 \u25e6 and CAM angle = 25.0 \u25e6, this setting provides wav elength co v erage of 3210\u20136300 \u00c5 e xcluding the 4216\u20134273 \u00c5 nd 5276\u20135331 \u00c5 regions falling in the CCD gaps.\nThe raw CCD frames have been preliminary processed using he SALT data reduction pipeline (Crawford et al. 2010 ). We used he standard IRAF 1 procedures to reduce the resulting 2D spectra. lat-field corrections and cosmic ray zapping were applied to all cience frames. We extracted the one dimensional quasar spectrum rom the background subtracted 2D science frames from each epoch sing the IRAF task \u2018apall\u2019. Wavelength calibration was performed sing standard Argon lamp spectra. In addition, skylines from the avelength calibrated spectrum were matched with the sky line tlas provided by SALT and, if needed, corrections were applied o increase wavelength accuracy . Similarly , flux calibration was\nNRAS 514, 1975\u20131989 (2022)\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which re operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, nc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.\n2 s f s J\nerformed using reference stars (G93-48 and LTT4364) observed lose to our observing nights.\nThe spectral resolution and average signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) btained are summarized in columns 6 and 7 of Table 1 . Our SALT pectra typically have a spectral resolution of R \u223c 830 (roughly factor of two smaller than that of SDSS) at central wavelength 780 \u00c5 and S/N in the range 13\u201355 per-pixel. In total, we have pectra of J1322 + 0524 obtained during 10 epochs spreading o v er 9 yr. We denote them by epoch-1, epoch-2, etc., in chronological rder (given in column 1 of Table 1 ). In the SDSS catalog (P \u0302 aris t al. 2012 ) the quoted emission redshift of J1322 + 0524 is em = 2.0574 \u00b1 0.0002. Hewett & Wild ( 2010 ) derive a systemic edshift of z em = 2.0498 \u00b1 0.0006 from the fit of the C III ] emission.\ne use this latter value as the systemic redshift for all discussions n this paper. Note that given the high velocities of the BALs we tudy here, the exact emission redshift has little influence on our tudy.\nContinuum fitting is very important in the study of BALs as he measurement of equi v alent width of v arious lines is highly ependent on its accurac y. F or J1322 + 0524 we use the conventional ower law + Gaussians fit, where a power-law is used to fit the ine-free regions [excluding the wavelength range with narrow and road absorption and emission lines (BEL)] and single Gaussians re used to fit C IV , Si IV , and N V BELs. F or the power-la w fit, e considered the following line-free regions in the rest frame of he quasar : 1335.0\u20131350.0 \u00c5, 1635.0\u20131730.0 \u00c5, 1755.0\u20131820.0 , 1970.0\u20132700.0 \u00c5. In Fig. 1 , we show the SALT spectrum of 1322 + 0524 obtained during epoch-9 (MJD 59262) together ith the best fitted continuum (red). Various prominent absorption ines are also identified in this figure. We provide the details of hese systems and their variability nature in the following sections. ontinuum fits to spectra obtained in the different epochs are shown n Fig. 2 . As in Aromal et al. ( 2021 ), we correlate the absorption line ariability with the continuum variability using available broad-band hotometric light curv es. F or this, we obtained publicly available hotometric light-curves of J1322 + 0524 from the Panoramic urv e y Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS; hambers et al. 2016 ), the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF; Law et al. 009 ), and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al. 2019a , b ) urv e ys. P an-STARRS pro vides photometric data of J1322 + 0524 or five broad-band filters, i.e. g, r, i, z, and y whereas ZTF gives the ame for the g, r, and i bands. Details of photometric variability of 1322 + 0524 are discussed in Section 4 .\nBALs in J1322 + 0524 1977\nFigure 1.

We mark different absorption lines (identified with labels) from 5 narrow absorption systems identified based on C IV doublets (different colors). For easy discussions, we se gre gate the C IV broad absorption profile into three components (i.e BAL-A, B, and C) shown with shaded regions having different colours. Inset shows the multiple component nature of BAL-A with possible signatures of line-locking at C IV velocity splitting in epoch-2. The velocity scale for C IV BAL absorption with respect to the systemic redshift ( z em = 2.0498) is provided at the top. The expected wavelength range for different absorption lines from BAL-B and BAL-C are indicated with magenta and green horizontal lines respectively. In the case of N V and Ly \u03b1 (both affected by Ly \u03b1 contamination), the shaded region has been scaled from the C IV profile for illustration.\n3\nI d\n3\nW o a o z s a ( c f r i t (\nz s M t\ns o f s a s o\n3\nJ o ( o i L F T s s s a e F B B\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/2/1975/6595319 by C N R S user on 06 July 2023\nANALYSIS O F ABSORPTION FEATURES n this section, we mainly focus on the different absorption lines etected in the spectra of J1322 + 0524 and their time variability. .1 Narro w inter v ening absor ption lines\ne identify five C IV narrow absorption line systems in the spectra f J1322 + 0524 in all epochs. In Fig. 1 , we identify these systems nd mark different ionic absorptions like C IV , Si IV , N V, and Ly \u03b1 riginating from these systems. The redshifts of these systems are abs = 1.7626, 1.8885, 1.9098, 2.0003, and 2.0457. The last two ystems are within 5000 km s \u22121 to the quasar\u2019s systemic redshift nd therefore satisfy one of the definitions of associated absorption Foltz et al. 1986 ). We do not detect any statistically significant hange in the rest equi v alent width of C IV or any other absorption rom both these systems. As the spectra used here are of low esolution, we are not in a position to measure the co v ering factor n these cases. Presence of partial co v erage would hav e confirmed hese systems to be physically associated with J1322 + 0524 Hamann 1997 ; Barlow & Sargent 1997 ).\nThe first three systems show strong associated Ly \u03b1 absorption. The abs = 1.8888 system also shows absorption from low-ionization pecies (Mg II , Fe II , Si II and Al II ) as well. We also detect weak\ng II absorption associated with the z abs = 1.7626 system in he SDSS spectrum. In addition to the abo v e mentioned 5 C IV\nystems, we detect an intervening system at z abs = 1.6050 based n the Mg II doublet. We also detect Fe II and Al II absorption lines rom this system but no C IV absorption. We do not observe any ignificant variability in the rest equivalent widths of C IV and/or other bsorption lines from these 6 narrow absorption systems between our pectroscopic epochs. We used these narrow absorption lines to check ur wavelength calibration accuracy.\n.2 Broad absorption line\n1322 + 0524 was classified as a BAL quasar based on the presence f a broad C IV absorption at z abs \u223c1.975 in the first SDSS spectrum epoch-1). The C IV absorption co v ers an ejection v elocity range f 5800\u201313300 km s \u22121 with respect to the systemic redshift and s split in two sub-components. Absorption from Si IV , N V , and y \u03b1 are clearly detected (see yellow and magenta shaded regions in ig. 1 ). We do not detect Al III absorption in any of our spectrum. he wavelength range of Mg II absorption is covered only in SDSS pectra and we do not detect Mg II absorption. We refer to these ystems as BAL-A and BAL-B in our discussions below. In our ubsequent monitoring using SALT observations, we identify an dditional newly emerged broad C IV absorption spread up to an jection velocity of \u223c29 000 km s \u22121 (see green shaded regions in igs 1 and 2 ). For the ease of discussions, we name this emerging AL as B AL-C. Below we provide detailed description of these three AL components.\nMNRAS 514, 1975\u20131989 (2022)\n1978 P. Aromal, R.

The C IV absorption consists f at least five narrow components (see Fig. 1 ). Interestingly, the elocity separation between them is roughly consistent with the IV doublet separation, which suggests a possible line-locking etween these components. We detect N V absorption from all the ndividual components identified in the C IV trough. We also detect i IV absorption in some of our spectra (i.e epochs 1, 6, 7, and 9) from his system, in particular when C IV and N V absorption equi v alent idths are large.

Both C IV and N V absorption lines f BAL-A present flat cores between 7000\u20138300 km s \u22121 in epochindicating saturated absorption. We solve the above equation for IV and N V BALs assuming the absorption originate from the same egion and obtain f c = 0.94 and f e = 0.75. Such an e x ercise is not ossible for other velocity ranges as we are not sure about the line aturation. Thus, BAL-A component seems to not only co v er the continuum mission region almost completely but also covers substantial area f the BLR. This suggests that the absorbing gas is either co-spatial r outside the BEL region. We estimate the size of the C IV BLR to e \u223c0.09 pc using the measured rest frame 1350 \u00c5 monochromatic uminosity and equation 2 of Kaspi et al. ( 2007 ). If we assume that ndividual absorption components have similar covering factor, then he size of individual clouds will be of the order of 0.07 pc. High esolution spectra are needed to measure the co v ering factor and its ariation across the absorption profile using residual fluxes of the oublets for individual components at different epochs.\n.2.1.2 The C IV variability time-scale : From Fig. 2 , it is clear that he absorption lines of BAL-A show time variability. To quantify his, we measure the rest equi v alent width of C IV , Ly \u03b1, Si IV , and N V bsorption of BAL-A component at each epoch using the normalized pectra. Measured C IV equi v alent widths are summarized in Table 1 nd Ly \u03b1, N V, and Si IV equi v alent widths are summarized in Table 2 . ote that due to severe blending in lower resolution spectra used ere, we could only estimate the total equi v alent width that includes ontributions from both the doublet transitions. In the top panel of ig. 3 , we plot the measured C IV equi v alent width as a function of JD. From this figure and Table 2 , it is evident that C IV equi v alent idth has changed between any two epochs of observations. To xplore this further, we plot the absolute fractional change in C IV qui v alent width versus the rest frame elapsed time ( MJD) for all ossible pairs of measurements in Fig. 4 . The binned results (o v er 00 rest frame days shown using points with errobars) confirm the\nariation in the C IV equivalent width o v er different time-scales. The hortest time-scale (between epoch 9 and 10) o v er which significant est equi v alent width change (2.64 \u00b1 0.07 \u00c5) seen is \u223c27 rest frame ays. Largest variations are noticed o v er a time-scale of 400\u2013700 rest rame days. This could be due to variations either in the UV ionizing adiation or in the gas co v ering factor (probably due to transverse otions). If we assume the first possibility then the recombination ime-scale should be shorter than the smallest time-scale o v er which ariations are seen. Using this argument, we obtain a lower limit on he electron density of 6 \u00d7 10 4 cm \u22123 for the assumed gas temperature f 10 4 K (using equation 9 of Srianand & Petitjean 2001 ).\n.2.1.3 Relationship between different species :It is also apparent rom Fig. 3 (top panel) that the variability in the rest equivalent idth of all three ions considered here occurs in unison. To further xplore this correlation, we compare, in the bottom panel of Fig. 3 , he variations in the rest equivalent widths of C IV and N V between all ossible combinations of our spectroscopic epochs. These variations\nMNRAS 514, 1975\u20131989 (2022)\n1980 P. Aromal, R. Srianand and P.

The red and blue profiles o v erlayed are predicted from the observed profile during epoch-2 after allowing for variations in co v ering factor and optical depth respectively (see text for details).

This confirms that the C IV equi v alent width varies more i.e 1.72 times) than that of N V . This could indicate that the N V bsorption is more saturated than the C IV absorption. The Si IV bsorption is clearly detected when C IV and N V rest equi v alent idths are in excess of 9.1 \u00c5 and 9.0 \u00c5 respectively. From Table 2 e see that the rest equi v alent width of N V is less than that of C IV hen Si IV absorption is detected. In addition the Si IV equi v alent idth changes by more than an order of magnitude between epochs \u20132, 7\u20138, and 9\u201310. The corresponding reduction in C IV and N V qui v alent widths in the corresponding epochs is much smaller. This nce again suggests the presence of line-saturation with N V being ore saturated compared to C IV . .2.1.4 Covering factor or optical depth variations?:It is natural to ssociate the equi v alent width variations to changes in the optical epth (e.g. the column densities). Ho we ver, discussions presented bo v e suggest that C IV absorption is most likely to be saturated (at east when it is close to maximum). In such cases, changes in the o v ering factor also introduce large equi v alent width changes even hen there is no large variations in the ionising radiation. Here, we rst explore whether the observed C IV variations can be understood n the framework of changes in the co v ering factor. We obtain the pparent optical depth as a function of ejection velocity (for epoch-2) sing,\n( v) = \u2212ln [\nR( v) \u2212 1 + f c f c\n] .\nere, R ( v) is the measured residual flux at a given velocity. In the ase of epoch-2, the centriods of C IV absorption from components -4 have similar residuals which under the assumption of saturation ranslate to f c \u2265 0.85. We construct the \u03c4 ( v) for this epoch using a onstant f c = 0.85, then we compute the C IV profile at other epochs y simply changing f c keeping \u03c4 ( v) constant. Results of such an x ercise are shown in Fig. 5 with red curves. In the case of SALT pochs, the profiles are convolved with an appropriate Gaussian to atch the spectral resolution. For epoch-1 spectrum, the absorption n the core are well reproduced by increasing f c to 1. Note that the redicted profile is not well reproduced in the wings. This is also\nNRAS 514, 1975\u20131989 (2022)\nhe case for epoch-7 (when C IV is strongest). The core of the C IV bsorption in epoch-4 spectrum is reproduced for f c = 0.45. In this ase the absorption in the wings are o v er-produced. Ho we ver, in he remaining cases, a simple scaling of the co v ering factor does roduce reasonably good match (as suggested by the reduced \u03c72 ; i.e. f c in Fig. 5 ). This e x ercise suggests that if there are no optical depth ariations, then at least for the strongest absorption component, the o v ering factor is required to vary between 0.4 and 1.0.\nNext, we consider the case where we keep f c constant o v er all pochs and allow the optical depth to change by a constant factor hrough the profile. We obtain the profile using,\nv = f c exp( \u2212k\u03c4v ) + 1 \u2212 f c . (1) ere k is a scaling parameter that is varied to match profiles at ifferent epochs. In this case, we obtain \u03c4 v from the second epoch pectrum assuming f c = 0.95 (close to what is found when the bsorption is most saturated). The results for this case are shown ith blue curves in Fig. 5 . This provide somewhat better fit (based n reduced \u03c72 ) to the observed profile at most epochs compared to he case with simple f c v ariations. Ho we ver, we do see the fit is not erfect in the red wings in the highly saturated case. Between epochand epoch-7 (respectively epoch-1) the optical depth is required to ary by a factor of 6 (respectively 7).\nIn summary, BAL-A shows line-locking signature with C IV doulet splitting and strong absorption line variability o v er all measured ime-scales. All the three ions detected show correlated variabilities. arge variability seen in Si IV (i.e close to an order of magnitude)\nBALs in J1322 + 0524 1981 e w R e s c C f v c t t i p 2\n3\nT v e q p C i v w c l e B\nw n T N t d s o e i a e s\n3\nT t t e a t c i N f I i m\nFigure 6.

This uggests partial co v erage for the absorbing gas which may be either o-spatial or outside the BEL regions. The observed variations of IV absorption require a factor of \u223c2 ( \u223c6) variation in the co v ering actor (optical depth) o v er the monitoring period. The optical depth ariations provide slightly better fit to the data compare to pure o v ering factor variations. The o v erall v elocity structure (whether here is any covering factor or optical depth change) remained nearly he same during our observing period. Such a stable velocity structure n a line-locked flow (to be confirmed at high spectral resolution) can lace important constraints on the location of the flow (Srianand 000 ).\n.2.2 Observed properties of BAL-B:\nhe C IV absorption from this component (spreading o v er the ejection elocities of 10 500\u201313 300 km s \u22121 ) is clearly visible in the first poch SDSS spectrum. J1322 + 0524 was added to our sample of uasars with ultra fast outflows for SALT monitoring due to the resence of this component. The measured rest equi v alent width of IV absorption at different epochs for this component is summarized n Table 1 . Fig. 2 and Table 1 suggest that the BAL-B variability is ery similar to that of BAL-A. The maximum C IV equi v alent width as measured during epoch-7. As N V and Ly \u03b1 absorption from this omponent are expected in the Ly \u03b1 forest (see horizontal magenta ines in Fig. 1 ), we could not probe the time variations of their qui v alent widths. We do not detect any Si IV absorption from BALin any of our spectra. The observed C IV profile during epoch-7 (when the equi v alent\nidth is maximum) can be well approximated by 4 narrow compoents. These are consistent with two C IV doublets being present. he redshift difference between these two absorption are close to the V doublet splitting. This suggests the presence of line-locking as in he case of BAL-A. Even in the first epoch spectrum, we detect two istinct C IV doublets in the BAL-B profile that also have a velocity eparation close to N V doublet splitting. Interestingly, the location f these two components are different from what we find during poch-7. The variations in the depth of these components are visible n Fig. 6 (vertical dashed line for BAL-B). As the absorption lines re relatively weak, we need high resolution spectra to confirm the xistence of line-locking and possible kinematic shift between the trongest components.\n.2.3 Observed properties of BAL-C:\nhis BAL component was not present in the spectra observed during he first three epochs. Ho we ver, it is e vident from Fig. 2 that his component (BAL-C; spread o v er 15 000\u201329 000 km s \u22121 ) has merged, grew to reach a maximum equivalent width during epoch-6 nd subsequently weakened during our SALT monitoring period. As he C IV absorption is shallow and spread o v er a large velocity range, ontinuum fitting is important to confirm its presence and to measure ts rest equi v alent width accurately. As can be seen from Fig. 1 , the V absorption from this component is blended with Ly \u03b1 absorption rom narrow C IV absorption systems at z abs = 1.9098 and 1.8888. t is possible that this part of the spectrum is also contaminated by ntervening Ly \u03b1 forest absorption. Thus it is difficult to accurately\neasure the N V equi v alent width at different epochs.\n1982 P. Aromal, R. Srianand and P. Petitjean\nM\nFigure 8.

This gure confirms the trend we notice in Fig. 2 . The C IV rest equi v alent idth measured from the normalized spectra are also summarized in able. 1 . Ne xt to e xplore the equi v alent width v ariations of N V and Si IV bsorption, we plot the ratio of the spectrum obtained for epoch-7 ith respect to the epoch-4 (and epoch-6) spectrum in Fig. 8 . The trong variation in the N V absorption is clearly visible. Even in this ase the changes in the rest equi v alent width of C IV and N V happen n the same direction as we found in the case of BAL-A. We also see ossible dip in the ratio spectrum at the expected position of Si IV bsorption. This suggests that, like in the case of C IV and N V , the qui v alent width of Si IV also shows increasing trend. To confirm the i IV variability we show the ratio plot in the Si IV region in Fig. 9 . ossible dip is seen in the expected position of Si IV absorption during poch 6 and 7 (second and third panel from the top). We do not see ny non-zero variation for other epochs.\nEven though the overall absorption profile of BAL-C looks mooth, a closer look at the profile reveals interesting features. uring epoch-1 while the broad absorption is not clearly visible e notice narrow absorption features around the ejection velocity of 1 360 km s \u22121 . Similarly, in the epoch 2 spectrum, we notice extra bsorption consistent with being a C IV doublet at an ejection velocity f 23 800 km s \u22121 (see Fig. 6 ). We also see some narrow absorption eature around ejection velocity of 18 500 km s \u22121 in the spectrum btained in epoch-6 (see Fig. 6 ). These absorption features (that are resent only during one epoch) can not be associated with any of the arrow C IV systems discussed before. Interestingly all these features re consistent with being C IV absorption. Thus it is possible that the merging component BAL-C encompasses rapidly varying narrow eatures. This could indicate the presence of rapidly evolving clumps f gas embedded in an o v erall smooth flow. The large ejection velocities coupled with large velocity spread re consistent with the emerged gas being close to the central engine\nNRAS 514, 1975\u20131989 (2022)\ni.e region of high gravitational potential) and associated with the ccretion disc-wind (Arav, Li & Begelman 1994 ; Murray et al. 1995 ). s can be seen from Fig. 1 , the absorption mainly occurs against the ontinuum emission i.e. against the accretion disc emission and not EL. Therefore, it is difficult to identify the location of the absorbing as relative to the BLR through covering factor arguments as we have one in the case of BAL-A. We put a lower limit on the co v ering actor ( f c ) of BAL-C after considering the minimum transmitted flux long the C IV BAL profile. This turns out to be around < 70 per cent f the total continuum flux for C IV BAL-C implying f c \u2265 0.30 (as he lines need not be saturated). This means that the projected size f this flow is very small.\n.2.4 Correlated BAL variability\nn Fig. 10 , we compare the time evolution of C IV equivalent widths f different identified BAL components. For both BAL-A and BAL, C IV rest equi v alent widths were minimum during epoch-4, then howed a sharp increase and reached a maximum during epoch-7 efore declining. The strong correlation between BAL-A and -B qui v alent widths is confirmed by the Spearman-rank correlation nalysis (with r = 0.7 with a p-value of 0.01). From Table 1 , t is clear that the fractional change in equi v alent width between ny two epochs is larger for BAL-B compared to BAL-A. This ould just be related to BAL-A component being more saturated han BAL-B if the entire variability is driven by variations in the hotoionization. Ho we ver, recall the possible component variations n the case of BAL-B discussed abo v e. This needs to be considered hile interpreting the correlated variability.\nBALs in J1322 + 0524 1983\nFigure 10.

F or e xample, the eak C IV equi v alent width occurs during epoch-6 for this component hereas for other components, the peak is during epoch-7. It is also vident from Table 1 , that C IV equi v alent width of BAL-C during pochs 4-7 is higher than that of BAL-A. But it becomes weaker han that of BAL-A in the last three epochs. The Spearmann rank orrelation analysis suggests a strong correlation (i.e r = 0.79 and -value of 0.04) between B AL-A and B AL-C considering the last SALT epochs data. The slight de viation sho wn by BAL-C can e attributed to the narrow components that appear and disappear etween the two epochs (see the discussions in Section 3.2.3 ). Correlated C IV absorption line variability between components t different velocities has been reported in the literature using large amples of quasars (e.g. Capellupo et al. 2011 ; Filiz Ak et al. 2013 ; ang et al. 2015 ; Rogerson et al. 2018 ). F or e xample, Filiz Ak et al. 2013 ) have found similar fractional changes in the C IV equi v alent idth between low and high v elocity BAL troughs. The y argued that he correlated C IV absorption line variability is due to changes in the hielding gas properties (i.e changes in the C IV ionizing radiation). he correlated variability we find in the case of J1322 + 0524 (using 0 epoch spectra co v ering a wide range of time-scales) is consistent ith their findings. We show the time evolution of the C IV emission line rest\nqui v alent width obtained from our continuum + Gaussian fits in ig. 10 . Interestingly this follows the o v erall trend set by different AL components with subtle differences. Compared to epoch-1, poch-2 spectrum shows less C IV absorption equi v alent widths and e notice the C IV emission line flux is less during this epoch as ell (see Fig. 11 ). The C IV absorption equi v alent widths grows and eaches maximum value during epoch-7. The C IV emission line flux ollows the same trend. In the subsequent epochs, the C IV absorption nd emission equi v alent widths decrease. The observed variations of he C IV emission profile o v er short time-scales are consistent with eing driven by ionization induced variations (i.e reverberation). In hat case it suggests possible variations in the C IV ionizing flux o v er ur monitoring period. It is usual procedure to interpret such a correlated variability etween different BAL components and BEL equi v alent widths to\nhanges in the ionization due to quasar variability (see for example, romal et al. 2021 ). Wang et al. ( 2015 ) have found a correlation etween variations in the equivalent widths of C IV emission lines nd BALs in their sample. They also concluded that the absorption ine variations are driven by ionization changes. Covering factor ariations will not be able to explain the observed C IV emission ine variations (that samples the full volume) unless otherwise one ntroduces large changes in the gas distribution in the broad line egion (that can only take place o v er larger time-scales, i.e typically v er the sound-crossing time).\nPHOTOMETRI C VARI ABI LI TY O F 1 3 2 2 + 0 5 2 4\nn Fig. 12 , we plot the CRTS V-band light curve of J1322 + 0524 in he top and the measured structure function (as defined in MacLeod t al. 2012 ) in the bottom panels.

During this period the IV rest equi v alent width of BAL-A has reduced by a factor of 2.4 etween epochs 3 and 4. Clearly the rest equi v alent width variations re much larger than the fractional variation in the quasar magnitude een in the CRTS light curve. It is well known that CRTS light curves obtained without any filter), while sensitive to overall variations in he quasar brightness, will not capture colour variations accurately. In Fig. 13 , we plot the publicly available light curves of 1322 + 0524 obtained in three different filters (g, r and i-bands). hile these light curves are not sampled uniformly in time, ZTF meaurements provides good coverage during our last 5 spectroscopic pochs. It can be seen from this figure that J1322 + 0524 was faint round epoch-6 compared to SDSS and Pan-STARRS photometric oints and ZTF measurements in subsequent epochs. This together ith the nearly flat CRTS light curve over the first five epochs seen in ig. 12 are consistent with a fading of J1322 + 0524 between epochs and 6. It is also clear that the quasar has brightened between epoch and 7 and remained nearly at constant magnitude level for the last 3 pochs (within 0.05 mag in g- and r-bands). Ho we ver, the absorption qui v alent width variations are not monotonic as one would expect rom the light curves. It is clear from Table 1 that C IV rest equi v alent idths of all the three components have shown significant correlated ariability (by 25 to 40 per cent for BAL-A; by 45 to 64 per cent for AL-B and 27 to 28 per cent for BAL-C) o v er the period co v ered by he last three epochs where the g and r-band light curves are flat. We have ZTF photometric measurements available within two ays of our SALT spectroscopic measurements for the last 5 epochs. e used them to fix the absolute flux scale of our spectra as described n Aromal et al. ( 2021 ). Including three SDSS spectra, we have 8 pochs for which spectra with good flux calibration are available. e use these to further probe the correlation between C IV equi v alent ith and continuum flux variations. We quantify the continuum flux using the monochromatic flux at bserved 5000 \u00c5 (i.e at the rest frame wavelength of 1640 \u00c5), F 1640 \u00c5, easured from our flux calibrated spectra. Between the first two DSS epochs F 1640 \u00c5 has increased by a factor 1.15 while the C IV\nNRAS 514, 1975\u20131989 (2022)\nqui v alent width has reduced by a factor 1.32. F 1640 \u00c5 was nearly the ame between epochs 6 and 7. Ho we ver, we do see the C IV equi v alent idth being increased by a factor 1.20. In the top panel of Fig. 14 , we plot the C IV rest equi v alent width gainst F 1640 \u00c5. All the BAL components show a clear anti-correlation etween the C IV rest equi v alent width and F 1640 \u00c5. Such a trend is sually interpreted as an effect of changes in the photoionization quilibrium. Ho we ver, for a gi ven F 1640 \u00c5 there is a large spread in IV equi v alent width. In the bottom panel of Fig. 14 , we plot the ractional variation in C IV equivalent width against the fractional ariation in F 1640 \u00c5 between all possible pairs of spectra. There is a trong correlation between the two quantities. In the case of BAL-A omponent (Spearman rank correlation r = -0.61 with a p-value of \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), we notice a spread in EW / EW of \u223c0.5 \u2212 0.7 at any iven F / F \u223c 0. As noted before, BAL-B shows a stronger antiorrelation (Spearman rank correlation r = -0.85 with a p-value of \u00d7 10 \u22129 ) and much larger fractional variation in C IV equi v alent idth compared to BAL-A. This could be related to BAL-A being ore saturated compared to BAL-B (as apparent from Fig. 1 ).

Hence, the bserved correlation is relatively weak (r = -0.5 and p-value of 0.15). ooking at the 1st and 4th quadrant (in the bottom panel of Fig. 14 ) t is evident that a similar fractional change in rest equivalent width s associated with larger changes in the flux in the 1st quadrant (i.e ncreasing flux and decreasing EW) compared to the 4th quadrant i.e decreasing flux and increasing EW). Such a trend is expected hen (i) the absorption lines are near saturation that can lead to symmetric change in equi v alent with for similar change in column ensity (induced by the changes in the ionizing flux) around the ean, and/or (ii) the mean ionization parameter is close to when he C IV fraction is maximum which can also lead to asymmetric esponse to change in ionizing flux.\nThe requirement of large changes in the ionizing flux can be econciled if we allow for the C IV ionizing photon flux to have arger variability compared to what we measure in the FUV range (i.e 1640 \u00c5). The scatter can be understood if the C IV ionizing photon flux as a range of values for a given F 1640 \u00c5 (similar discussions in Aromal t al. 2021 , in the case of J1621 + 0758). On the other hand, it is also ossible that in addition to the changes in the ionizing flux, variations n other parameters such as the co v ering factor (see discussions in the revious section) or changes in the gas properties could contribute o the scatter. The changes in the line of sight gas distribution is also uggested in the case of BAL-B and BAL-C through the presence of apidly varying narrow absorption components as discussed abo v e.\nMishra et al. ( 2021 ) have found the newly appeared BALs are ssociated with dimming of the quasars. Interestingly, the emergence f BAL-C happens close to the dimming episode in the lightcurve f J1322 + 0524 (see Fig. 13 ). Mishra et al. ( 2021 ) interpreted he appearence of a new BAL component as the consequence of o wer ionization. Alternati vely, it is possible that both the dimming nd BAL emergence can be related to changes in the accretion isc structure (see Vivek et al. 2012 , for discussions in the case f J1333 + 0012). In the following section we analyse the observed ariability properties in the framework of simple photoionization odels.\nDISCUSSIONS\n.1 Photoionization model\nn this section, we try to understand the C IV absorption line variabilty of BAL components in the framework of simple photoionization PI) models. Based on the inferred co v ering factor (for epoch-7 when bsorption lines are strongest) it is most likely that the absorbing as is either co-spatial with or located outside the BEL region typical distance of \u223c0.09pc from the central UV source). First, e construct the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of 1322 + 0524 using the method discussed in Aromal et al. ( 2021 ) refer to subsection 5.2.1) using the available photometric data. Then, e use the code CLOUDY to simulate the thermal and ionization onditions in the absorbing gas (assumed to be a plane-parallel slab f uniform density with solar metallicity) after illuminating it with he abo v e SED from one side. We run CLOUDY v17.01 (Ferland et al. 017 ) under optically thin (to the H I ionizing photons) conditions nd vary the ionization parameter (U) from log U = \u22125 to 2 in steps f 0.2 de x. F or the assumed SED the number of ionizing photons er second from J1322 + 0524 is, Q \u223c2.7 \u00d7 10 56 s \u22121 . In this case, he distance of the absorbing gas ( r ), ionization parameter (U) and\number density n H are related by,\n= 139 . 3 \u00d7 ( 10 5\nn H\n)0 . 5 (10 \u22121 . 4 U )0 . 5 pc . (2)\nonstraints on the models come from the measured correlation etween the C IV and N V equi v alent widths and the anti-correlation etween the fractional change in equi v alent width and continuum ux. Ideally one needs to compare the model predicted column ensities with the observed ones. Also the single slab considered ere may not be an ideal representation of multiple components seen n observations. Thus, we do not make any rigorous attempt to model ll observational aspects discussed in the previous section. But draw ome general conclusions.\n.1.1 PI model for BAL-A\nn the top panel of Fig. 15 , we show the ion fraction as a function f the ionization parameter. In order to reproduce the observations hat both C IV and N V absorption show correlated variability we eed the ionization parameter to be greater than 0.1 (vertical dashed ine at log U = \u22121 in the top panel). In this regime the column ensity of both C IV and N V will increase with decreasing quasar ux as suggested by our observations (see Fig. 14 ). To detect Si IV bsorption, the ionization parameter should be closer to log U \u22121. In this ionization parameter range very small fraction (i.e 1 per cent ) of Si remains as Si IV . Our models suggest that the i IV column density will be \u223c two orders of magnitude smaller than hat of C IV (see bottom panel of Fig. 15 ). Thus PI models suggest strong saturation for C IV and N V during epochs when we detect i IV absorption. Ideally, the N V and C IV equi v alent widths should be ame in the case of strong saturation as they only probe the velocity pread. The small difference we find in their equivalent width ratios ndicates possible differences in the co v ering factors of C IV and N V .\nWe have noted that between epoch 7 and 8 (or 9 and 10) the Si IV qui v alent width has changed by more than a factor 10. This can be\nMNRAS 514, 1975\u20131989 (2022)\n1986 P. Aromal, R. Srianand and P.

Such a change will produce a factor of reduction in the C IV column density while we observe a factor of .6 reduction in the C IV equi v alent width. Our measured F 1640 \u00c5 has hanged by 13 per cent between epoch 7 and 8. This confirms our arlier suggestion that for photoionization induced variations to be f fecti ve we require a larger change in the number of C IV ionizing hotons compared to the number of UV photons at 1640 \u00c5. As discussed before the recombination time-scale less than 26 d i ves a lo wer limit on n H of \u22656 \u00d7 10 4 cm \u22123 (using equation 9 from rianand & Petitjean 2001 ). This together with the lower limit of og U = \u22121.0 suggests r < 113 pc from the central ionizing source.\n.1.2 PI model for BAL-C\ns BAL-C component also shows variations of C IV and N V in the ame direction the constraint on log U will be similar to what we ave for BAL-A (i.e log U > \u22121). In the top panel of Fig. 8 , we plot he ratio of spectra obtained during epochs 4 and 7. In the absence f absorption line variability we expect the ratio spectrum to be flat. t the locations of the absorption lines, the ratio spectrum gives the hange in the apparent optical depth. Using the C IV optical depth ifference profile for BAL-C we are able to reproduce its the N V rofile by a simple scaling [(i.e d N (C IV ) = 0.38 \u00d7 d N (N V )]. This x ercise, shows that the ratio of C IV to N V column density is nearly onstant across the profile.\nTo obtain more insights, we considered the C IV apparent optical epth profile measured during epoch-7 using the continuum noralized spectrum. Using this we predict the N V absorption profile or various log U assuming same U for the full velocity range we investigate this assumption bit more in the next section). The rofiles at the expected position of N V for log U = 0.2 (a v oiding the egions contaminated by narrow Ly \u03b1 absorption) matches well with he predicted profile. At this ionization parameter we expect very ittle Si IV absorption. Note the ionization parameter will be lower if e allow for [N/C] ratio to be more than solar as found in the case of ssociated absorbers (Petitjean, Rauch & Carswell 1994 ). We notice hat even when we allow for a factor of 3 higher abundance of N with espect to C the models will not produce sufficient Si IV absorption. hus the possible presence of Si IV absorption seen in Fig. 8 does ot arise naturally in the PI model. This could mean one or more of: i) C IV and N V absorption being saturated and estimates based on pparent optical depths underestimate their column density, (ii) nonolar metal abundance of Si (i.e excess by an order of magnitude) ith respect to N and O and/or (ii) multi-phased outflows well mixed n the velocity space so that there are no clear profile differences etween different ions.\nThe option (i) is the simplest explanation. Ho we ver, the C IV bsorption line does not show flat bottom. This could just mean ulti-streaming flow having different co v ering factor o v er different elocity ranges. As noted before the large velocity dispersion shown y the C IV absorption is inconsistent with single slab model. In the ollowing, we see whether these issues can be addressed using simple ensity and velocity profiles of the absorbing material.\n.2 BAL-C as a disc wind\ns pointed out before, the large velocity width of BAL-C absorption ould mean the absorbing gas is associated with a disc-wind. Simple D disc-wind models predict velocity and density as a function of adial distance from the accretion disc. Here, we investigate whether\nNRAS 514, 1975\u20131989 (2022)\nhe absorption profiles of BAL-C are consistent with such a scenario. e create a model absorption profile for the BAL-C component y incorporating CLOUDY simulation results with an assumed radial ensity and velocity profile. Wind models predict a radial velocity rofile of the form (see Murray et al. 1995 ),\n( r) = v \u221e (\n1 \u2212 r f r\n)\u03b2 , (3)\nhere r is the distance to the cloud from the central source, v \u221e is he terminal velocity, \u03b2 \u223c 1.15 and r f is the launching radius of the ind. In the literature it is usual to assume r f to be the distance at hich the circular velocity is v \u221e . We also assume a density law, n ( r ), s follows,\n( r) = n 0 ( r\nr 0\n)\u2212\u03b1 , (4)\nhere n 0 and r 0 are constants and \u03b1 = 2 consistent with a ass-conserving spherically expanding wind. We consider density\ntructures corresponding to three values of \u03b1 (0 [constant density], 1 nd 2). The ionization parameter (U) of the gas is given by,\n= Q H 4 \u03c0n H cr 2 , (5)\nhere Q H is the total number of hydrogen ionizing photons produced y the source, n H is the density of hydrogen in the cloud and c is he speed of light. The value of Q H is fixed by the assumed quasar ED and the measured continuum fluxes. Once v( r ) and n ( r ) are ormalized with an appropriate choice of constants in equations 2 nd 3 , U ( r ) and hence the ion densities at different velocities are given t any radial distance. In all our models we consider v \u221e = 30 000 m s \u22121 and r f = 0.02 pc which fixes v( r ). We then assign log U c at given velocity v c = 12 000 km s \u22121 . For a given density law this xes the ionization parameter of the gas at any velocity v. The value f n 0 is fixed to match the maximum observed optical depth of the IV line. The column density of C IV originating from any distance nterval ( r ) at a distance r can be obtained using,\ntheory ( r) = n H ( r)[ C/H ] f CIV ( r) r, (6) here [C/H] is carbon metallicity (assumed to be solar) and f CIV is he C IV ion fraction. Similarly we can predict the column density rofile and hence the absorption profile of ions of our interest. The Si IV absorption profile predicted by the model ( v c 12 000 km s \u22121 and log U c = -1.8) are also consistent with obervations. Since the density and velocity profiles are monotonous in hese models, low C IV optical depth at high velocities is produced by as with low ionization parameter (i.e C IV ion fraction is decreased y going to lower ionization parameter at large distances/velocities). his gas produces strong Ly \u03b1 absorption contrary to what has been bserved. Also these models under-produce the N V absorption. We were unable to get consistent fits to the observed C IV and V absorption just by changing the values of different parameters. n Fig. 16 we illustrate the effect of varying \u03b1 and U c . In the top anel of Fig. 16 , we show the effect of varying \u03b1 for a fixed v c nd U c with the other model parameters kept constant as given in able 3 . The model with \u03b1 = 0, while reproducing the C IV and Si IV rofiles well o v er-produces the Ly \u03b1 absorption and under-produces he N V absorption. Increasing the value of \u03b1 makes the absorption rofile flat and broad, inconsistent with the observed profiles. In the ottom panel of Fig. 16 , we show the effect of increasing the log U c or a fixed v c = 12 000 km s \u22121 . It is evident that the peak optical epth in C IV absorption occurs at larger velocities for larger values f log U c . This is mainly because log U \u223c \u22122 is now shifted to arger distances and velocities. Ho we ver, all these models produce\nBALs in J1322 + 0524 1987\nFigure 16. Top panel: Observed spectrum of J1322 + 0524 during epoch7, when BAL-C has the maximum C IV equi v alent width. The unabsorbed spectrum (the best fitted continuum, shown in blue, to epoch-2 spectrum when BAL-C was not present.) is also shown. The predicted absorption profiles of C IV , Si IV , N V and Ly \u03b1 absorption (using the density and velocity law described in Section 5.2 and CLOUDY models) for v c = 12 000 km s \u22121 , log U c = -1.8 and three values of \u03b1 are shown. Bottom panel: The effect of varying log U c at a given v c . The model with large log U c tends to shift the peak C IV absorption towards higher velocities. Also note none of the models that reproduce the observed C IV profile produce sufficient N V absorption and all of them o v er produce the Ly \u03b1 absorption.\nl c fi b t t v r\na r 2 c s w\n6\nU v D g p\nt 6 a i ( v\n5 t c c 2 d S w w t e w a\nu i c t ( a P f d t A s t w s o w\nw n f a\nr i a l a e n e e a p p\na fl s i t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/514/2/1975/6595319 by C N R S user on 06 July 2023\ness N V absorption compared to what is observed. We notice that hanging r f does not impro v e the situation. In the case of \u03b1 = 1, we nd that the profile shape can be made to match the observed profile y changing r f v alues. Ho we ver, as in the case of \u03b1 = 0 models even hese models do not produce sufficient N V absorption because of he reasons discussed abo v e. Thus it appears that smooth density and elocity profiles do not produce either the observed profile or the ion atios correctly.\nIn hydrodynamical simulations, the radial distribution of density nd velocity depends on the inclination angle of our line of sight with espect to the disc plane (see for example figure 2 of Dyda & Proga 018 ). It will be interesting to check whether C IV , N V , Ly \u03b1 and onstraints on Si IV absorption of BAL-C can be reproduced from uch simulations (using similar e x ercise as in Ganguly et al. 2021 hich focuses on very highly ionized species).\nSUMMARY\nsing the SALT, we have been carrying out a systematic study of time ariability of BAL absorptions in a sample of 63 quasars from SDSS R15 (P \u0302 aris et al. 2017 ) which show BALs at outflow velocities reater than 15 000 km s \u22121 (UFOs) in their spectra. In this paper, we resent a detailed analysis of J132216.25 + 075808.4 ( z em = 2.0498),\nhat shows a strong correlated variability in absorptions spread o v er 000\u201329 000 km s \u22121 . Such a variability is rare and also not noticed mong other objects in our sample. For ease of discussions, we dentify three BAL components well separated in the velocity space namely BAL-A, B and C in the ascending order of the outflow elocity).\nOur analysis suggests that C IV BAL-A, at outflow velocities of 800\u20139900 km s \u22121 , consists of multiple narrow absorption features hat are separated roughly by the C IV doublet splitting. Such oincidences, if confirmed with high resolution spectra, are usually onsidered as the signature of line-driven acceleration (Srianand et al. 002 ). The C IV absorption from BAL-A shows a large variability uring our monitoring. In addition to C IV , we also detect N V and i IV absorption from this component (when C IV and N V equi v alent idths are large enough). Interestingly N V and Si IV vary in unison ith C IV . We find the absorbing gas to co v er substantial part of both he continuum and BLR regions implying that the absorbing gas is ither co-spatial or located outside the BLR. Observed equi v alent idth variations can be reasonably well reproduced by optical depth nd/or co v ering factor variations. Constraining the location of the absorbing gas is important to nderstand their origin. Photoionization models suggest the ionzation parameter to be in the range, log U \u2265 \u22121.0. Based on the o v ering factor and recombination time-scale arguments we suggest he location of the absorbing gas to be \u2264113 pc and outside the BLR i.e > 0.1 pc). Presence of absorption from fine-structure levels will llow us to constrain the distance accurately (for example, Srianand & etitjean 2001 ). Arav et al. ( 2018 ) using density sensitive S IV troughs ound that at least 50 per cent of the quasar outflows are situated at istances greater than 100 pc and 12 per cent at distances greater han 1 kpc. Similar analyses (Borguet et al. 2013 ; Chamberlain & ra v 2015 ; Ara v et al. 2020 ) ha ve used high-ionization diagnostics to how that the outflows are located at several hundred parsecs rather han sub-parsec scales (0.01\u20130.1 pc) as assumed in standard disc ind models. It will be interesting to search for the presence of finetructure absorption lines using high resolution and high SNR spectra f J1322 + 0524 to constrain the locations of different components ith respect to the continuum source. BAL-B, at velocities of 10500\u201313300 km s \u22121 , is a relatively\neaker. There are indications that even this component is made up of arrow absorption components. The Si IV absorption is not detected rom this component and N V and Ly \u03b1 are difficult to detect as they re weak and probably contaminated by intervening absorptions.\nWe report the emergence of BAL-C spread o v er a large velocity ange (15 000\u201329 000 km s \u22121 ). Starting from the initial SALT epochs, ts rest equi v alent width reaches maximum during epoch-6. The C IV bsorption progressively became weaker in subsequent epochs. The arge ejection velocities coupled with large velocity spread suggest scenario where the emerged gas is launched close to the central ngine and may be associated with an accretion disc wind. A few arrow absorption features are also detected in BAL-C at certain pochs indicating the presence of rapidly evolving clumps of gas mbedded in a smooth flow. We find the observed absorption profiles re inconsistent with simple models using density and velocity rofiles predicted in typical 1D wind simulations together with hotoionization calculations. We note all the identified BAL components show correlated varibility. We find a strong anti-correlation between the monochromatic ux at 1640 \u00c5(F 1640 \u00c5) and the C IV rest equi v alent width with a large catter for all the components. We also find the fractional variation n C IV equi v alent width between any two epochs is correlated with he fractional change in F 1640 \u00c5 between the same epochs. All these\nMNRAS 514, 1975\u20131989 (2022)\n1988 P. Aromal, R. Srianand and P.

We also notice similar hanges in the strength of the C IV BEL which confirms the presence f variations in the ionizing radiation. We obtained publicly available photometric light curves to look for ossible long time-scale variations in the continuum flux which may ead to the photoionization induced BAL variability. Even though e see considerable fading of J1322 + 0524 in g, r and i bands uring the emergence of BAL-C, the light curve does not show arge coherent variation as suggested by photoionization models. he photoionization scenario could be reconciled with observations f (i) variation of the C IV ionizing photons are larger than that of the V continuum seen in our spectra and (ii) there is a scatter in the onizing photon flux for a given UV flux observed. Moreover, it is lso possible that variations in other parameters such as the co v ering actor or changes in the gas properties could contribute to the scatter n the measured rest equi v alent width for a given measured flux.\nThe physical picture we suggest consists of BAL-A being a stable lumpy outflow located far from the central source (further than EL region) and BAL-C being a newly formed wind component ocated near the accretion disc. While it is possible that density rofile along our line of sight in the case of BAL-C may be time ariable and the co v ering factor of BAL-A may vary with time, ny large variation in the ionizing flux will introduce correlated ariability. Continued monitoring (in particular at higher spectral esolution) of this interesting source will provide further insights nto this interesting system.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the anonymous referee for useful suggestions.
