    "abstractText": "This paper proposes a novel predefined time nonsingular terminal slidingmode control (TSMC) based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) for nonlinear systems. Firstly, a new lemma of tunable predefined time stability (PTS) is proposed, where the introduction of an adjustable parameter can adjust the stability time of the system and makes the design of the controller more flexible. Secondly, based on the proposed lemma, a new control method is proposed, which not only guarantees the PTS of the system, but also solves the singularity problem of the traditional TSMC and the problem of unknown model information. Finally, through comparative simulation, it is verified that the proposed method has good control performance.

INTRODUCTION\nIN this era of rapid development of science and technology,people need to keep improving the performance of actual industrial systems. Any actual physical system is more or less nonlinear, such as hydraulic servo system [1], robot control system [2], multi-agent [3], spacecraft system [4] and so on. Control methods for nonlinear systems have sprung up rapidly, such as backstepping control [5], [6], sliding mode control (SMC) [4], [7], [8], adaptive control [9], etc. Among them, SMC has been widely studied by scholars due to its strong robustness and ability to handle disturbances [10], [11].\nHowever, SMC can only ensure asymptotic stability, and its convergence time cannot be estimated, which seriously affects control efficiency. Tasks such as emergency rescue, missile launch, and rocket launch need to be completed within the specified time, otherwise significant losses will be caused, which limits the application of SMC. Therefore, while ensuring that the system achieves the expected control objectives, it is also necessary to ensure that the convergence time (CT) is within the predefined range as much as possible. In order to meet the above requirements, Bhat et al. [12] proposed the concept of finite time control. Compared with asymptotic stability, it improves the convergence speed of the system states and enables them to converge within a finite time.\nReference [13] added a linear term to sliding surface to enable the system states to converge at a faster rate and provided an expression for the CT. However, the CT of finite time control algorithms depends on the initial states of the system. If the initial values of the system are not appropriate, it will seriously affect the stability. Fortunately, Polyakov et al. [14] proposed a fixed time control method, ensuring that the upper bound of the CT is a constant. However, the relationship between control parameters and CT is often complex, and the estimation of CT is too conservative. To further solve this problem, a predefined time control algorithm was proposed, which can predetermine the convergence time boundary [15]. Due to this major advantage, predefined time control algorithms have been applied in practical systems such as aerospace [16] and underwater robots [17]. Reference [18] proposed a predefined time SMC algorithm to ensure that the arrival phase in SMC is predefined time stable. Reference [19] designed a predefined time attitude tracking controller for the attitude tracking problem of rigid spacecraft. Reference [20] proposed a predefined time attitude stability control scheme for aircraft attitude stability.\nBased on the above literature and reading other relevant literature, we find that the following difficulties still need to be addressed: (1) The controllers designed in References [19] and [20] have negative exponential terms, which can\nVOLUME 11, 2023 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

If this problem is not solved, in some cases the amplitude of the controller will be very large, which does not match the actual situation. Therefore, this paper addresses the singular problem while ensuring PTS of the system. (2) Most of the existing literature on predefined time stability (PTS) has not considered the issue of unknownmodel information. Although RBFNN is unilized to approximate terms with unknown model information in [21], [22], only finite time or fixed time stability can be ensured, which upper bound of CT is influenced by the initial states or controller parameters. This paper will further research how to achieve PTS using RBFNN, while keeping the upper bound of CT set by the user themselves. (3) When the system stabilizes within the predefined time range, the actual CT is not adjustable. For example, if the user sets a predefined time of 8 s, the actual CT of the system needs to meet T < 8s, and the actual CT may be 1 s, 4 s or 7 s. How to design an algorithm to adjust the actual CT and make the predefined time closer to the user requirement is a major challenge.\nBased on the above analysis and discussion, this paper proposes a novel predefined time nonsingular TSMC based on RBFNN. The main contributions are as follows:\n(1) Based on the tunable PTS definition, this paper proposes a new tunable PTS lemma. Compared with Lemma 1, the proposed lemma introduces adjustable parameters, making the design of the controller more flexible and can adjust the actual CT of the system.\n(2) Based on the proposed lemma, this paper designs a new control method to ensure that the system can achieve PTS during both sliding and arrival stages.\n(3) Inspired by the Reference [23], this paper proposes a new method by introducting a saturation function (SF). Thus we not only solve the singular problems, but also guarantee the predefined time stability of the system, which is not considered in Reference [23].\n(4) In this paper, a new controller based on RBFNN is designed, which not only solves the problem of unknown model information, but also ensures that the system converges to the sliding surface in a predefined time. A complet proof of PTS based on Lyapunov method is presented here.\nII. PREPARATION AND PROBLEM FORMULATION A. KEY DEFINITIONS AND LEMMAS Consider a nonlinear system:\nx\u0307 = f (x, t) x(0) = x0 (1)\nwhere x \u2208 Rn represents the system states. Function: f : Rn \u2192 Rn is nonlinear and continuous, and f (0) = 0. Lemma 1: [24] For the system (1), if there is a Lyapunov function V (x), it satisfies the following conditions\nV\u0307 \u2264 \u2212 \u03c0 \u03b1Tc (V 1\u2212 \u03b1 2 + V 1+ \u03b1 2 ) (2)\nThen the system (1) is predefined time stable. Tc > 0 is the predefined time, 0 < \u03b1 < 1.\nDefinition 1: [15] If the equilibrium point of the system (1) is stable in a finite-time, and T : Rn \u2192 R satisfies: T (x0, \u00b5) \u2264 Tc,\u2200x0 \u2208 Rn, then the equilibrium point of the system (1) is considered to be tunable predefined-time stable, Tc is a predefined time. \u00b5 represents a tunable parameter. Remark 1: Compared with fixed time control, the upper bound of the convergence time of the proposed method in this paper is set by the user, which is independent of the controller parameters. Compared with traditional PTS, the advantage of tunable PTS not only ensures the predefined time stability, but also enables the actual CT of the system to be adjustable. Lemma 2: If there exists a positive definite function V (x) for the system (1) defined on the set U , for any x \u2208 U0\\{0}, the set U0 \u2286 U , V (x) satisfies the following formula\nV\u0307 \u2264 \u2212 \u03c0 \u03b1\u00b5Tc (V 1\u2212 \u03b1 2 + \u00b52V 1+ \u03b1 2 ) (3)\nwhere 0 < \u03b1 < 1, Tc > 0, \u00b5 > 0.

Tc is the predefined time. This ends the proof. Remark 2: Compared with Lemma 1, the proposed Lemma 2 introduces an adjustable parameter \u00b5, which not only ensures predefined time stability, but also can adjust the actual CT by adjusting the value of \u00b5. When \u00b5 = 1, Lemma 1 is a special case of Lemma 2. According to Eq. (2), in spite of the control gain \u03b1 exists, the upper bound Tc of the CT is set by the user in advance and cannot be changed. Here the major role of \u03b1 is to stabilize the system. According to the property of the predefined time stability, the value range of \u03b1 is limited and the adjustable range is very small. Therefore, the adjustable"

It makes the actual CT of the system can be adjusted by adjusting parameter \u00b5, which conforms to the Definition 1. Remark 3: In actual control engineering, we expect to know the time of system stability. For the finite time control and fixed time control, we can obtain the upper bound of the convergence time, but the upper bound values obtained by the above methods are either related to the system states or to the controller parameters. The advantage of predefined time control is that the upper bound of the convergence time is set by the user and is independent of the system states and controller parameters. For example, if we require the task to be completed within 8 s, we need to set the parameter Tc to 8s in the predefined time algorithm, which is set by the user according to the actual needs. Lemma 3: If there exists a positive definite function V (x) for the system (1) defined on the set U , for any x \u2208 U0\\{0}, the set U0 \u2286 U , V (x) satisfies the following formula\nV\u0307 \u2264 \u2212 \u03c0 \u03b1\u00b5Tc (V 1\u2212 \u03b1 2 + \u00b52V 1+ \u03b1 2 ) + \u03b7 (9)\nwhere \u00b5 > 0, 0 < \u03b1 < 1, Tc > 0, 0 < \u03b7 < \u221e. Then the system (1) converges to a small domain \u2210 close to the origin in a predefined time \u221a 2Tc. \u2210 ={\nx \u2208 n \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223V \u2264 min{( 2\u03b7\u03b1\u00b5Tc\u03c0 ) 22\u2212\u03b1 ,( 2\u03b7\u03b1\u00b52Tc\u03c0 ) 22+\u03b1}}.\nProof 2: According to Eq.

So the system (1) converges to this region V 1\u2212 \u03b1 2 > 2\u03b1\u00b5\u03b7Tc\u03c0 in \u221a 2Tc.\nFor Eq. (11), when V 1+ \u03b1 2 > 2\u03b7\u03b1\u00b5Tc\u03c0\u00b52 , one can obtain V\u0307 \u2264\n\u2212 \u03c0\u03b1\u00b5Tc (V 1\u2212\u03b12 + 12\u00b5 2V 1+ \u03b1 2 ).

Lemma 4: [25] If x1, x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xN are positive scalars and 0 < c < 1, d > 1, then one can obtain\n( N\u2211 i=1 |xi|)c \u2264 N\u2211 i=1 |xi|c\nN 1\u2212d( N\u2211 i=1 |xi|)d \u2264 N\u2211 i=1 |xi|d (12)\nB. PROBLEM FORMULATION Most systems such as robots and spacecraft are second-order nonlinear systems. Hence we take the following form as the model [26].\nx\u03071 = x2 x\u03072 = f0(x) + g0(x)u+ E(x, t)\n(13)\nwhere x = [x1, x2] \u2208 R2 denotes the states, f0(x) is a nonlinear function, g0(x) represents a known nonlinear smooth function, u specifies the controller input, E(x, t) denotes the external disturbance. Assumption 1: [19] The system uncertainties and disturbances are bounded: |E(x, t)| \u2264 D, D > 0. The goal of control is to design a control law u to make the system trajectory reach the desired trajectory. The tracking error is\ne1 = x1 \u2212 x1d e2 = x2 \u2212 x\u03071d\n(14)\nwhere x1d is the expected value of x1. Combining formula (13) and (14), one has\ne\u03071 = e2 e\u03072 = f0(x) + g0(x)u+ E(x, t)\u2212 x\u03081d\n(15)"

The SF in the Figure 1 is defined as Eq. (19)\nsat(x) = {\nx x \u2264 h hsign(x) x > h\n(19)\nwhere h is a positive constant.

Inspired by Reference [27], a RBFNN in Fig. 2 is employed to deal with f0(x).

The compared control method has certain similarities with the proposed control method, such as items with an index greater than 1, items with an index less than 1, and the use of a SF.\nThe detailed expression for nonsingular fixed time control are as follows [28]\ns = e\u03071 + c1|e1|\u03d11sign(e1) + c2|e1|\u03d12sign(e1) (42)\nu = \u2212g0\u22121(x)[f0(x)\u2212 x\u03081d + sat(c1\u03d11|e1|\u03d11\u22121e\u03071) +c2\u03d12|e1|\u03d12\u22121e\u03071 + c3|s|\u03d13sign(s) +c4|s|\u03d14sign(s) + D2sign(s)]\n(43) where c1, c2, c3, c4,D2 > 0,\u03d11 = m1+12 + 1\u2212m1 2 sign(|e1|\u22121), \u03d12 = m2+1 2 + m2\u22121 2 sign(|e1|\u22121), \u03d13 = n1+1 2 + 1\u2212n1 2 sign(|s|\u2212 1), \u03d14 = n2+12 + n2\u22121 2 sign(|s|\u22121), 0 < m1, n1 < 1,m2, n2 > 1. Figure 3 shows the curve of trajectory tracking , indicating that all controllers can achieve the expected goals, but the proposed method is the earliest to achieve the desired trajectory. Figure 4 shows the curve of tracking error, which indicates that the proposed control method has a short CT and small steady-state error.\nFigure 5 shows the curve of the sliding surface, indicating that the proposed control method has the shortest convergence time and the best steady-state error. Figure 6 shows that the control output curve of the proposed method is the smoothest and meets the requirements of actual control engineering.\nFigure 7 shows the convergence time of sliding variable and tracking error under different controllers. The actual convergence time is within the designed convergence time, and the designed convergence time does not depend on the parameters of the controller, which is more in line with the requirements of actual control engineering.\nFigure 8 and 9 respectively show the approximation error and weight update law of RBFNN, indicating that RBFNN has a good ability to approximate nonlinear functions, and the approximation error is within the allowable range."

When \u00b51 = 0.5, the CT is shorter than \u00b51 = 1.\nVI. CONCLUSION This paper proposes a novel predefined time nonsingular TSMC based on RBFNN, which ensures that the tracking error can be predefined time stable in both the arrival and sliding stages. RBFNN is used to approximate nonlinear functions to solve the problem of unknown system model information. And the singular problem of TSMC was solved by using a SF. Finally, the proposed method has been verified to have good control performance through comparative simulation. However, faults will occur in actual control engineering, and fault-tolerant control will be further analyzed in future work.\nREFERENCES [1] J. Chao and W. Aiguo.
