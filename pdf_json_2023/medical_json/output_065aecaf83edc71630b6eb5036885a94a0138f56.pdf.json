Therapy options for HBV/HDV patients are still limited. Here, we investigated the potential of natural killer (NK) cells that are crucial drivers of the innate immune response against viruses to target HDV-infected hepatocytes.\nMethods: We established in vitro co-culture models using HDV-infected hepatoma cell lines and human peripheral blood NK cells. We determined NK cell activation by flow cytometry, transcriptome analysis, bead-based cytokine immunoassays, and NK cell-mediated effects on T cells by flow cytometry. We validated the mechanisms using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene deletions. Moreover, we assessed the frequencies and phenotype of NK cells in peripheral blood of HBV and HDV superinfected patients.\nResults: Upon co-culture with HDV-infected hepatic cell lines, NK cells upregulated activation markers, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) including the death receptor ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), produced interferon (IFN)-g and eliminated HDV-infected cells via the TRAIL-TRAIL-R2 axis. We identified IFN-b released by HDV-infected cells as an important enhancer of NK cell activity. In line with our in vitro data, we observed activation of peripheral blood NK cells from HBV/HDV co-infected, but not HBV mono-infected patients.\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Immunology\nConclusion: Our data demonstrate NK cell activation in HDV infection and their potential to eliminate HDV-infected hepatoma cells via the TRAIL/TRAIL-R2 axis which implies a high relevance of NK cells for the design of novel anti-viral therapies.\nKEYWORDS\nNK cells, HDV, TRAIL, HBV, IFN-beta"

            "text": "The HDV affects at least 12 million people worldwide (1). The HDV is a small, single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus, capable of infecting hepatocytes. For the formation and secretion of progeny virus the HDV requires the envelope protein of the HBV. Recent studies demonstrated cell division-mediated intrahepatic spread of HDV-mono-infected cells in humanized mouse models and in vitro (2\u20134). It was reported recently that similar to HBV, HDV uses the human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (hNTCP) receptor to enter hepatocytes (5). Thus, ectopic expression of the NTCP in hepatic cell lines opened up the possibility to study HDV infection in vitro, and to gain insights into their crosstalk with other cells in co-culture. In 2020, Bulevirtide/Hepcludex (formerly called Myrcludex B), a peptidic inhibitor that specifically targets the NTCP, was conditionally approved in Europe, offering a valuable treatment option for HDV patients (6). Understanding the immune response is required to extend the repertoire of current therapy options (7). NK cells are abundant in liver tissue and known for their anti-viral activity (8). In hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, NK cells express a high amount of TRAIL and the degranulation marker CD107a, indicative of a cytotoxic state, compared to healthy donors (HDs) (9). A higher frequency of NK cells prior to therapy with IFN-a, the currently only off-label treatment for HDV patients, was positively associated with a therapy-induced reduction in HDV RNA in serum, highlighting the significance of NK cell activity in HDV infections (10). NK cells can stimulate the cellular immune responses through release of IFN-g, or can directly eliminate virus-infected cells (11). Killing of infected cells can be mediated either through the release of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzyme B, or by the engagement of death receptors on target cells, TRAIL-R1/2 and Fas (12). TRAILmediated cytotoxicity has not only been shown to be important for the elimination of HBV-infected cells, but can also to fulfill an immunoregulatory function through the elimination of hepatitis virus-specific T cells (13). The mechanistic underpinnings of NK cell reactivity in HDV infection, however, are poorly understood. Therefore, we established co-culture models of human NK cells and three different hepatocyte cell lines susceptible to HDV infection (HepG2-hNTCP, Huh7-hNTCP, HepaRG-hNTCP), to dissect the activation, cytotoxicity and immunoregulatory role of NK cells, and validated our results in a cohort of hepatitis patients.\n02"

HDV infection did not significantly change the cell surface expression of the NK cell ligands MICA/B, NKp30/44 ligands, CD54, CD112, OX40L, HVEM, B7H6 and PD-L1 or the expression of HLA molecules on infected hepatoma cells (Figure 1B). To determine the NK cell response on hepatic cell lines after HDV infection, we assessed the expression of different cell surface markers, including CD69 after 2 and 6 days of co-culture (Figure 1C). NK cells displayed an increase in CD69, a marker for NK cell activation, both after 2 and 6 days of co-culture with HDV-infected HepG2-hNTCP cells compared to non-infected controls (Figure 1C). In addition to 2D co-cultures, we used 3D HepG2- hNTCP spheroids, whose structure and metabolism is considered to be of high physiological relevance (27). In concordance with the data obtained with 2D co-cultures, upon HDV-infection, spheroid co-cultured NK cells demonstrated an increase in CD69 expression (Figure 1C). In addition to CD69, NK cells from co-cultures with HDV-infected HepG2-hNTCP cells showed an upregulation of additional activation markers (Figure 1D).

While HDV infection by itself did not induce cell death (Figure 2A), NK cells demonstrated a strong cytotoxicity towards HDV-infected HepG2-hNTCP cells (Figure 2B). Additionally, we observed preferential killing of HepG2-hNTCP cells that stained positive for the HDVAg by NK cells (Supplementary Figure 2).\nTo determine molecular pathways enriched in NK cells upon HDV infection, we compared the NK cell transcriptome after co-culture with non-infected or HDV-infected HepG2-hNTCP cells. Expression of transcripts encoding for the death receptor ligands FasL and TRAIL (TNFRSF10), and cytolytic effectormolecules including granzyme B and perforin, were enriched (Supplementary Figure 3A), whereas other transcripts such as ones encoding for certain NK receptors in the \u201cNK cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway\u201d were downregulated for NK cells from HDV-infected cultures compared to non-infected cultures (Supplementary Figure 3B). In concordance with the transcriptomic data, we observed elevated protein expression of TRAIL on the NK cell surface in co-culture with HDV-infected HepG2-hNTCP or HepaRGhNTCP cells (Figure 2C). Of note, TRAIL-R2 expression did not differ between HDVAg- and HDVAg+ cells (Supplementary Figure 3C). Although upregulated at the transcriptional level, granzyme B and perforin protein expression by NK cells remained unchanged in the presence of HDV-infected cells (Supplementary Figure 3D). In addition, FasL surface expression was not detectable on co-cultured NK cells and tumor necrosis factor-a secretion by NK cells was not increased upon co-culture with HDV-infected hepatoma cells (data not shown). Both TRAIL-R1 and 2 are known to induce cell death upon ligand binding. Since TRAIL-R1 was only detectable to negligible amounts on HepG2 cells, we focused on TRAIL-R2 which was ubiquitously expressed (Supplementary Figure 4A). To determine whether in HDV-infected co-cultures NK cells kill target cells via TRAIL-TRAIL-R2 interaction, we generated HepG2-hNTCP cells deficient in TRAIL-R2 expression (hNTCP-TR2 KO) (Supplementary Figure 4A). Expression of the HDV entry receptor NTCP, frequency of infected cells and the expression of the surface molecules MHC class I chain related-proteins A and B (MICA/B), Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)1 and CD155 that potentially regulate NK cell cytotoxicity did not differ between control cells and hNTCP-TR2 KO cells (Supplementary Figures 4B\u2013D). Upon NK cell co-culture, we observed that HDV-infected TRAIL-R2 KO\nfrontiersin.org\nHepG2-hNTCP cells were less susceptible to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity compared to HDV-infected control targets (Figure 2D). Of note, the expression of TRAIL-R1/2 and the decoy receptors TRAILR3/4 was not altered or induced upon infection with HDV, respectively (Supplementary Figure 4E). Peripheral blood NK cells can be divided into CD56bright NK cells, which are considered to mainly produce cytokines and to be precursors to CD56dim NK cells, which are considered to mainly exert cytotoxicity (31). In presence of HDVinfected cells, CD56bright NK cells displayed higher levels of IFN-g, PD-1, CD107a, CD69 and TRAIL (Supplementary Figure 5). Collectively, these data demonstrate that in HDV-infected co-cultures NK cells\nFrontiers in Immunology 06\nupregulate TRAIL expression and kill HDV-infected hepatic cell lines using the TRAIL/TRAILR2 pathway."

Altogether, this data reveals that NK cells, conditioned by HDV-infected hepatoma cells, did not inhibit autologous T cells in vitro.\nA\nB\nDC\nFIGURE 2 Cytotoxicity of NK cells in HDV infection.

In addition, we observed downregulation of the ubiquitin-activating enzymes UBE2K and UBE2G2 (Supplementary Figure 6A). Furthermore, SP of HDVinfected HepG2-hNTCP cells was able to increase CD69 and TRAIL and intracellular IFN-g expression (Figure 4B). In addition, Huh-7hNTCP cells, which have been recently shown to be unable to mount an IFN response (41\u201343), did not induce the activation of NK cells and subsequently did not show increased susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity upon HDV infection (Figure 4C).\nWe therefore analyzed the production of type I interferons IFNa, b and type III interferons L-1/2/3 by HepG2-hNTCP cells upon HDV infection as soluble mediators of NK cell activation. We detected both an increase in IFN-b and IFN-L-l/2/3 in SPs of HepG2-hNTCP cells in response to HDV infection (Figure 4D). Among these factors, only IFN-b was able to mediate an increase in TRAIL and CD69 expression on NK cells in vitro (Figure 4E). In addition, the majority of transcripts associated with the IFN-b pathway were also more abundant in NK cells upon co-culture with HDV-infected cells compared to NK cells from non-infected co-cultures (Supplementary Figure 6A). To confirm the role of IFNb in mediating the observed NK cell activation upon encounter of HDV-infected cells in vitro, we generated NK cells deficient for the receptor for IFN-b, IFNAR. These IFNAR-KO NK cells showed a\nFrontiers in Immunology 08\nreduced phosphorylation of the IFNAR downstream target signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)2 and a reduced expression of TRAIL after in vitro stimulation with IFN-b (Supplementary Figure 6B). More importantly, these cells displayed a reduced TRAIL and CD69 induction in the presence of HDV-infected cells and impaired cytotoxicity towards these cells (Figure 4F). In summary, these findings highlight IFN-b as an important factor mediating NK cell activation in HDV infections."

            "text": "To investigate the clinical relevance of our findings, we analyzed the frequencies of NK cells in peripheral blood and their phenotype in HDs, cHBV and cHBV/cHDV patients. The patient cohort was almost exclusively cytomegalovirus (CMV) positive making an influence of the CMV status on our analysis unlikely (Supplementary Tables 1\u20135). The frequency of peripheral NK cells among PBMCs was decreased by HDV infection which was accompanied by a shift towards the CD16-CD56bright compartment (Figure 5A). In patients with resolved cHDV infection (PCR negative), both the frequency of total NK cells and of CD56bright NK cells were comparable to HDs (Figure 5A). In our cohort of cHBV and cHBV/cHDV patients, we observed upregulation of CD69, while expression of TRAIL remained unaffected (Figure 5B). In conclusion, cHDV infection causes a decrease in the frequency of peripheral NK cells and induces a shift of the NK cell population towards the CD56bright NK cell compartment. In addition, the higher frequency of CD69 expression in cHBV/cHDV patients implies a higher activation potential of these cells compared to cHBV patients.\nA B\nC\nFIGURE 3 Influence of NK cells on T cells in HDV infection.

            "text": "Contemporaneous infection of hepatocytes with HBV is necessary for the generation of infectious HDV particles. Nevertheless, HDV is capable of infecting hepatocytes and intracellular replication independent of HBV co-infection. More recently, also proliferation of HDV-mono-infected cells was shown to represent an important mechanism of HDV spread in the liver (4). In our co-culture system, we focused on the interaction between NK cells and HDV mono-infected cells in vitro. In HDV-infected co-cultures, NK cells displayed higher CD69 and TRAIL expression and higher IFN-g production compared to non-infected cocultures, indicative of their activation. Using a CRISPR/Cas9mediated gene deletion, we demonstrated the importance of TRAIL for NK cell-mediated killing of TRAIL-R2 expressing HDV-infected hepatoma cells. Cytotoxicity of NK cells towards infected cells is particularly important to limit viral spread in the early stages of infection (44). This corresponds to the rapid but transient expression of TRAIL on NK cells in HDV-infection that we observed. In addition, similar kinetics of TRAIL expression were seen in LCMV-infected mice (45). The lower expression of TRAIL by NK cells after longer co-culture with HDV-infected cells observed on day 6 of co-culture is likely due to the killing of IFNb producing HDV-infected cells by NK cells as we did not detect IFN-b after 6 days of co-culture in supernatants. Kinetics of TRAIL expression may be also regulated by sheddases such as metalloproteinases 2, but studies on this issue are controversial and we did not address this topic in our study (46). Recent studies demonstrated that engagement of TRAIL on NK cells can contribute to their degranulation (47). This indicates that NK cells do not only kill HDV-infected cells directly by TRAIL but are also triggered to degranulate as an additional cytotoxic mechanism. This is supported by our observation of increased degranulation of NK cells in infected co-cultures, and the incomplete inhibition of killing by KO of TRAIL-R2. Accumulating evidence indicates that NK cells do not only fulfill a cytotoxic effector function towards infected or tumor cells, but can also exert an immunoregulatory function towards T cells (48). Despite these observations, NK cells co-cultured with HDVinfected cells did not inhibit but induced proliferation of CD3/ CD28 activated T cells and IFN-g production. Activation of T cells by NK cells can be mediated by cell-contact dependent interaction including the OX40-OX40L and CD28-B7 axis or by secretion of IL-2 by NK cells (49\u201352). We also observed a strong cytotoxicity of NK cells in the presence of HDV-infected cells and additionally, preferential killing of hepatoma cells expressing the HDV antigen. This observation was not caused by differential expression of TRAIL receptors on hepatic cell lines upon HDV infection. We therefore suggest that NK cells in close proximity to HDVAg+ cells, hence IFN-b producing cells, gain a high cytotoxic capacity which leads to the killing of adjacent HDVAg+ cells. Of note, HepG2-hNTCP cells express the NK cell modulating molecules CD155 andMICA/B, and as a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, induce activation of NK cells also in the absence of HDV-infection. Although we observed some\nFrontiers in Immunology 09\nexpression of NK cell activation markers in co-culture with noninfected hepatic cells and moderate NK cell-mediated killing of these cells, we detected much stronger NK cell responses against HDV-infected HepG2-hNTCP cells supporting the relevance of HepG2-hNTCP/NK cell co-culture systems as a useful tool to study the immune response against HDV in vitro.\nTogether, our observations suggest an increased activation of NK cells in the presence of HDV-infected cells which may contribute to the severe liver damage found in HDV patients. The data at hand indicates IFN-b production by infected cells as an important mechanism in NK cell activation. These results are in line with different studies demonstrating an increased production of type-I and type III interferons by hepatocytes upon HDV infection, dependent on the sensing of HDV-RNA by melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (4, 43, 53, 54). ISG RIG1, which we found to be upregulated in NK cells upon encounter of HDV-infected cells, has been described to be a potent inducer of TRAIL and to support NK cell cytotoxicity without changing the expression of NK cell receptors, which is in concordance with our findings (38). In summary, these data suggest RIG1 as a potential factor to regulate NK cell cytotoxicity in HDV infection. Of note, several genes associated with IFN-b signaling were downregulated in NK cells encountering HDV-infected cells, including the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2K and UBE2G2. Since proteins of the UBE family have been shown to dampen the IFN response and to promote viral replication, their down-regulation may support the NK cell-mediated anti-viral response (55, 56).\nWe detected a decrease in the frequency of peripheral NK cells in cHBV/cHDV-infected individuals compared to HDs, which was restored upon successful therapy. Kefalakes and colleagues demonstrated a reduction of intrahepatic NK cells in HDVinfected patients compared to HD controls (57). Therefore, increased apoptosis or decreased repopulation of NK cells rather than a sequestration of NK cells to the liver may partially explain our observation.\nIn line with published data, showing that activated (HLA-DR+) NK cells were increased in HDV-infected patients compared to HDs, we observed an increase in CD69 expression frequency by NK cells from cHBV/cHDV-infected individuals (57). TRAIL expression on NK cells remained similar between HBV and HBV/ HDV patients which could be due to non-detectable levels of type I IFNs in sera of HBV and HBV/HDV patients (data not shown). The lack of detectable type I IFNs in serum might be due to the fact that type I IFNs are primarily produced locally in the liver in hepatitis patients (58\u201360). The fact that we observed CD69 upregulation, but not TRAIL upregulation on peripheral NK cells in HDV patients, could be due to the observation, that CD69 upregulation can be mediated by other factors besides type I IFNs, including CD16 activation, IL-2 and direct activation of protein kinase C (61).\nThe shift we observed in the composition of the peripheral NK cell compartment towards CD56bright NK cells was previously reported for HBV patients (62). In the same study, the frequency of peripheral CD56bright TRAIL+ NK cells in HBV patients correlated with liver damage.

The expansion of CD56bright NK cells that we observed in non-resolved HDV patients may therefor partially explain the high degree of liver damage found in these patients (63). Taken together, the altered frequency of CD56bright NK cells in patients together with their higher expression frequency of activation markers and TRAIL upon encounter of HDV-infected cells in vitro compared to CD56dim cells indicate a prominent role of the CD56bright compartment in the immune response against HDV. NK cells represent up to 50% of all intrahepatic lymphocytes. Although CD56bright NK cells only account for 10% of circulating NK cells, they represent up to 50% of liverresident NK cells, which further suggests that in particular CD56bright NK cells might participate in the immune response against hepatotropic viruses (64, 65).\nIn summary, our study identifies the TRAIL-TRAIL-R2 axis as an important mechanism for NK cells to target HDV-infected cells.\nFrontiers in Immunology 11\nMoreover, our findings demonstrate IFN-b as a factor, released by infected hepatoma cells that activates NK cells. Although it needs to be considered that NK cells might also mediate liver damage, our data indicate a high potential for NK cells as effector cells for the clearance of HDV in vivo.\nData availability statement\nFor the RNA-Seq the count data were transformed to TPM and FPKM expression values and the resulting count matrices are available via the link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc. cgi?acc=GSE249240 (GEO accession number: GSE249240).
