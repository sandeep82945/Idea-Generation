1. **Investigate the use of other machine translation models:** The paper focuses on using Transformer-based models for machine translation. Future research could explore the performance of other models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for translating between English and Arabic dialects.


2. **Explore the use of transfer learning for other language pairs:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning for improving the performance of machine translation models. Future research could investigate the use of transfer learning for translating between other language pairs, such as English and Spanish or English and Chinese.


3. **Develop methods for evaluating the quality of machine translation models for dialectal Arabic:** The paper uses BLEU and ROUGE metrics to evaluate the performance of machine translation models. Future research could develop new metrics or adapt existing metrics to better evaluate the quality of machine translation models for dialectal Arabic.


4. **Investigate the use of machine translation for other natural language processing tasks:** The paper focuses on using machine translation for translating between English and Arabic dialects. Future research could explore the use of machine translation for other natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis or text summarization.


5. **Develop methods for translating code-switching text:** The paper does not address the challenge of translating code-switching text, which is text that contains words or phrases from multiple languages. Future research could develop methods for translating code-switching text between English and Arabic dialects.
