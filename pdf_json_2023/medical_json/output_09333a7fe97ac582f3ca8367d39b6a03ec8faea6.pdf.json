    "abstractText": "As interest in skin aesthetics increases, treatments to suppress aging are increasing. Among them, a facelift is the most effective procedure for improving wrinkles. However, side effects including inflammatory reactions occur due to the limitations of the PDO thread itself used during the procedure. In this paper, to improve the function of PDO thread, inorganic particles such as magnesium hydroxide (MH) and zinc oxide (ZO) and a biologically active agent, asiaticoside, were coated on the surface of PDO thread using ultrasonic coating technology. The coated thread exhibited excellent biocompatibility, promoted collagen synthesis, reduced inflammation, and stimulated angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. The multifunctional PDO thread has shown promising potential for skin regeneration without inducing fibrosis. Such a practical coating system and the developed multifunctional PDO thread suggest new possibilities for developing safer and more effective materials in cosmetic and regenerative medicine to prevent aging and improve skin aesthetics.",

            "text": "As aging increases, the skin aesthetics and aging procedures are increasing. Aging progresses via various mechanisms such as collagen loss and muscle degeneration [1]. To suppress aging, treatments such as Botox, fillers, and facelifts are being performed to improve wrinkles, which are a prominent sign. Botox is a procedure that temporarily inhibits facial muscle contraction to diminish wrinkles, but it carries the risk of facial nerve paralysis as a potential side effect. Dermal fillers, on the other hand, involve restoring skin volume to reduce wrinkles but may lead to side effects like blurred vision and numbness around the eyes [2]. However, if the skin is severely saggy, wrinkle improvement using Botox and fillers is limited, and a facelift is inevitable [3]. The facelift improves wrinkles by inserting a lifting thread under the skin and is preferred due to its relatively small incision and short procedure time compared to cosmetic surgery [4]. The lifting threads used for a facelift are manufactured using various biodegradable polyesters such as poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(\u03b5- caprolactone) (PCL), and poly(dioxanone) (PDO), and the recently developed PDO threads are recognized for their excellence in the biodegradation period and biocompatibility [5]. It is well known that PDO is non-toxic to the human body because it is absorbed in the body and decomposed into CO2 and H2O and is generally decomposed\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2220. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15092220 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2220 2 of 14\nwithin approximately 6 months [6]. However, polyester including PDO produces acidic by-products in the process of hydrolysis in the human body. The acid by-products acidify the surrounding tissue, causing non-infectious inflammation [7]. Inflammation within the skin can accelerate aging and induce fibrosis [8]. To improve the non-infectious inflammatory response by acidic by-products of aliphatic polyester, the pH-neutralizing effect of magnesium hydroxide (MH) was utilized in our previous studies [9\u201311]. MH, a basic inorganic particle, exposed to an acidic environment reacts with hydrogen ions and dissociates into magnesium and hydroxide ions, resulting in a pH-neutralization effect. In addition, magnesium ions released by MH maintain the homeostasis of cells from various stimuli [7]. Zinc oxide (ZO), as a safe and nontoxic material recognized by the FDA, has recently received much attention in biotechnology, medicine, biology, and physics [12\u201315]. Recently, ZO has been reported by many researchers as a continuous nitric oxide (NO) release material by the oxidation-reduction reaction with NO donor [16,17]. NO serves as a signaling molecule responsible for essential biological functions in all tissues of the human body, such as the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems [18\u201320]. In particular, NO in the skin induces wound healing by being involved in an inflammatory response, immune response, angiogenesis, and collagen formation [21,22]. Asiaticoside (ATS) extracted from Centella asiatica has a triterpene structure and involves wound healing with anti-inflammation and collagen formation [23]. ATS induces the synthesis of type I collagen via the TGF-\u03b2 receptor I kinase-independent Smad activation pathway [24]. In addition, research on angiogenesis by ATS has recently been reported [25]. In this study, we devised an ultrasonic coating technology of functional inorganic particles that can reduce the occurrence of biological side effects. Moreover, a sustained release system of ATS that induces wound healing and skin regeneration was suggested. We demonstrated collagen synthesis, an anti-inflammatory effect, and angiogenesis by the coated multifunctional PDO threads in vitro and in vivo. This practical coating system and the developed multifunctional PDO thread suggest new possibilities for developing safer and more effective materials in cosmetic and regenerative medicine for anti-aging and improving skin aesthetics."

For this, 0.75 g oleic acid was dissolved in 70 mL of hexane and added to 3 g MH dispersed in distilled water. The mixture was then reacted at 60 \u25e6C for 4 h with stirring. Similarly, ZA nanoparticles were synthesized to enhance dispersion stability in the hydrophobic coating solvent and facilitate NO generation, as described in our previous study [16]. This was achieved through conjugation between ZO and \u03b1-lipoic acid (ALA). For the synthesis, 1.5 g \u03b1-lipoic acid was dissolved in 50 mL of chloroform and added to 1.5 g ZO. The mixture was then reacted at 60 \u25e6C for 24 h with stirring under a vacuum.

Another coating solution was created by dispersing MO (20 phr) and ZA (10 phr) in a PDLLA solution (0.3 wt% in chloroform), which also contained ATS (3 phr in THF). The surface of the multifunctional PDO thread (P) was then sequentially coated with these prepared solutions using an ultrasonic spray coater (Noanix, Cheongju, Republic of Korea) to obtain MO-coated PDO (PM), ZA-coated PDO (PZ), and ATS-coated PMZ (PMZA), respectively. The dispersion stability of MO and ZA in chloroform was investigated by measuring absorbance at 550 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M2 Microplate Reader, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) [26]. The coated surfaces and distribution of MO and ZA on PDO threads were visualized using field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE\u2013SEM; S\u20134800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The amount of MO and ZA was investigated by inductively coupled plasma\u2013optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Optima 8000, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).

However, it faced challenges in achieving excellent dispersion stability within the polyester matrix due to its inherent hydrophilic properties. To overcome this issue, surface modification of MH was performed using oleic acid. The binding between MH and oleic acid was evidenced through ATR-FTIR spectra by the presence of an -OH stretching peak at 3698 cm\u22121 from MH and a C=O stretching peak at 2920\u20132850 cm\u22121 from oleic acid in the MO (Figure S1A). Additionally, the amount of oleic acid bound to the surface of MH was quantified to be 4.71% through TGA analysis (Figure S1B). MH was observed to aggregate and precipitate in organic solvents, making it challenging to accurately measure its size using DLS. In contrast, the MO exhibited high dispersion stability and maintained a nano size of 255.2 nm (Figure S1C). As reported in our previous study, ZA had improved NO-generating ability and dispersion stability in hydrophobic materials compared to ZO. As previously analyzed, the synthesis of ZA was demonstrated using ATR-FTIR, TGA, and DLS (Figure S2). The FTIR spectrum of ZA included both the -OH of ZO and the C=O of \u03b1-lipoic acid peaks, and it was found that \u03b1-lipoic acid was bound by 9.8% through TGA analysis. The size of ZA was 109 nm. In order to deliver the successfully synthesized two surface-modified\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2220 6 of 14\ninorganic particles and ATS as above to the PDO thread, a coating solution containing the biodegradable polymer was prepared and the dispersion stability was evaluated. Compared to the immediate precipitation of unmodified inorganic particles in the coating solution, high dispersion stability was secured in the coating solution including surfacemodified inorganic particles for 1 h (Figure 1A(a)). Since fine precipitates can also affect coating uniformity, turbidity analysis was performed and the dispersion stability of coating solutions containing surface-modified inorganic particles was demonstrated to be excellent (Figure 1A(b)). The multifunctional PDO threads were coated using an ultrasonic coater. The coated surface and distribution of MO and ZA were displayed using FE-SEM and EDS mapping in Figure 1B. Each group did not display a significant change in the surface even after coating, and cog was also maintained. In addition, Mg and Zn elements used as indicators of MO and ZA, respectively, were evenly distributed over the entire area of the PDO threads. Since PDO threads require strong tensile force during a facelift, the effect on mechanical properties during the coating process was investigated (Figure S3). As a result, tensile strength, elongation, and Young\u2019s modulus of multifunctional PDO threads maintained the same strength as before coating. Table 1 shows the loading amount. MH, ZO, and ATS were coated on the multifunctional PDO threads at approximately 22, 13, and 10 mg, respectively. The NO generation by multifunctional PDO threads was treated with 50 \u00b5M of SNAP and GSH and visualized and quantified through DAF-FM (Figure 1C). The PDO threads did not generate NO. On the other hand, the NO-generating by PMZA was higher than other groups by catalysis of MO and ZA. Both MH and ZO have a NOgenerating ability, but ZO has the most excellent NO-generating capacity among numerous inorganic particles [17]. Moreover, the ability to generate NO of ZA was improved by \u03b1-lipoic acid [16]. The released ATS by PMZA was analyzed for 28 days, as shown in Figure 1D. ATS was rapidly released over 5 days and then slowly, with approximately 30% released over 28 days."

When a biom terial is mplanted into the tissue, foreign body reactions, such as inflammation a d fibrosis, m y occur [48]. However, no significant differences in tissue damage or foreign body response were observed in the H&E and MT staining images across all groups. It was quantified using MT staining images to measure the ratio of collagen formed (Figure S4). The proportion of collagen formed meaningfully increased in PMZ and PMZA. As described earlier, fibrosis results from excessive collagen formation triggered by an inflammatory response. To investigate fibrosis occurrence, the expression of genes related to inflammation (IL-6) and collagen synthesis (COL1A1) was measured (Figure 5B). The PM, PMZ, and PMZA groups exhibited IL-6 expression levels similar to the native group. In contrast, the PDO group showed increased IL-6 expression, likely due to acidic by-products. Moreover, COL1A1 expression was upregulated in the PMZ and PMZA groups. These results reveal that non-inflammatory collagen synthesis, rather than fibrosis, was induced in the PMZ and PMZA groups. To investigate the formation of new blood vessels, immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to identify the expression of CD31 as an endothelial marker in Figure 5C. The expression of CD31 was not significantly observed in PDO and PM. On the other hand, the expression of CD31 in PMZ and PMZA was highly expressed in the periphery of transplanted threads.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2220 11 of 14\nThe blood vessels created around the implanted thread can play a major role in regenerating the skin as it can help supply nutrients and remove waste to and from surrounding tissues smoothly.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 14\ntissue, foreign body reactions, such as inflammation and fibrosis, may occur [48].

This multifunctional PDO thread exhibited excellent biocompatibility, as evidenced by increased cell viability. It demonstrated the ability to regenerate skin through collagen synthesis and anti-inflammatory and angiogenic effects. Histopathological evaluation using a mouse model indicated that the multifunctional PDO threads did not induce significant tissue damage and foreign body response. Also, they stimulated non-inflammatory collagen synthesis in the surrounding tissues, not fibrosis. These results may improve skin elasticity, reduce wrinkles, and improve overall skin regeneration without inducing fibrosis or adverse reactions. This research suggests the potential for innovative biocompatible materials with multifunctional properties to advance cosmetic and regenerative medicine.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2220 12 of 14\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics15092220/s1, Figure S1: Characterization of surfacemodified MH (MO).
