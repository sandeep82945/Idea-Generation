Due to overweight and obese children and adolescents end up exposed to several psychological and behavioral problems (e.g., depression, reduction of self-esteem and problems associated with body image), which interfere with their interpersonal relationships and school performance [4]. In particular, adolescence is a crucial period of life, where many changes occur, making mental health a determining factor in this age range for later life.\nA possible strategy against overweight and obesity is to encourage children and adolescents to practice physical activities. It is known that the promotion of a healthier lifestyle helps to control body weight, extremely important not only for physical health [5], but also for mental health [6 - 8]. However, approximately 81% of adolescents between 13 and 15 years do not follow the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) for physical activity practice, regardless of socioeconomic level [9 - 11].\nHigh levels of physical activity have a positive association with mental health [9, 12], that is, evidence proposes that the practice of physical activity increases cognition and mental health through changes in brain functioning [13 - 17]. The opposite is also true, low levels of physical activity practice were associated with lower psychosocial well-being levels [18] and depression [19]. However, these associations have not been extensively studied [20] and need to be better investigated in this population, due to the high prevalence of childhood obesity around the world [21, 22]. Within this context, our study aims to determine the association between physical activity levels, body weight, depressive and anxiety symptoms among Brazilian adolescents."

Among these four factors, 'physical symptoms', 'danger avoidance' and 'social anxiety' are subdivided into 2 more factors, making a total of 39 items [24]. These items are answered by children/adolescents who can answer the affirmative, selecting alternatives from 0 to 3.

The cutoff point adopted was 17 points and the adolescents who obtained the highest score were considered individuals with a higher index of symptoms of depression [25].\n2.3.3. Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQA)\nTo collect information on the level of physical activity, the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) was used, a translation and cultural adaptation of the SelfAdministered Physical Activity Checklist [26]. The PAQ-A consists of a list of physical activities most practiced by Brazilian adolescents (culturally adapted), taking into account the age group and context of the \u201ctarget\u201d population, which measures the time, frequency and duration of the activity. This instrument allows you to estimate and classify the level of physical activity according to health recommendations. Furthermore, it has acceptable levels of reliability and validity in both younger (10-14 years) and older (14-19 years) adolescents. Adolescents with physical activity equal to or greater than 300min/week and others as insufficiently active were considered sufficiently active [27]."

            "heading": "4. DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The results of this study present relevant information about adolescents from Brazilian public schools, favoring a better understanding of the relationship between psychological\naspects, overweight and levels of physical activity in this age group. Although the literature presents the possibility that excess weight and physical activity level are associated with anxiety and depression [30 - 33], the results within the same sex did not show significant differences, with significant differences being found only in comparisons between groups of girls and boys. With the sample divided into adolescents with and without these common mental disorders and with control of the sex variable, no differences were observed in the variables of physical activity practice and exception of weight. Studies carried out with Brazilian adolescents show that females are more likely to be more anxious, depressed and more physically inactive than males [3, 8]. However, the prevalence of obesity has increased in males according to cross-sectional and temporal trends studies, with recent results showing balanced values or with small differences in relation to females [34, 35].\nHigher prevalence of anxiety and depression are common in females [3, 36]. A population-based study with a stratified sample of Brazilian schoolchildren corroborates the results of this study, presenting data from different regions of Brazil and identifying the prevalence of mental disorders of 26.7% between 12 and 14 years old and 33.6% between 15 and 17 years of age, being always higher in females [3]. When reflecting on anxiety and depression together, the higher prevalence of these disorders found in girls may be due to biological issues such as hormonal changes during adolescence that lead to changes in mood, neuroendocrine differences and differences in reproductive structures and functions that can also be responsible for such results [37, 38]. The literature also reports the effects of psychological and social variables that include the low social status of girls, in addition to rules and upbringing differentiated between the sexes, greater absorption of stressful events and the concern and demand for girls' body image [38, 39].\nAnother important observation in this study was the prevalence of depression close to zero in children, in addition to the fact that even with a low value, it should not be neglected. Although the results of the prevalence of depression may vary according to the characteristics of the population studied, any increase in cases in boys and girls should be considered of concern due to the additional dangers that depression can elicit, such as suicide ideation and increased consumption of licit and illicit drugs [1,2,40]. However, when it comes to anxiety, the result found must be considered relevant and deserves special attention for girls and boys. Studies in different parts of the world show a high prevalence of anxiety [2, 3, 38]. Anxiety should also be treated with greater concern, as it is considered an event that precedes depression and is associated with a worse quality of life, in addition to cardiometabolic diseases [2, 41].\nThe analysis of comparisons of the results of anxiety and depressive symptoms, with a sample divided into girls and boys with and without excess weight, represented by BMI and abdominal obesity, as well as physically active and inactive, also showed results obtained only among male groups and females, reinforcing those girls have greater symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the influences of overweight\nand physical inactivity cannot be highlighted. Our results broaden the discussion about associations between overweight and depression and anxiety, as other studies demonstrate the need for higher levels due to contradictory results [42, 43]. A study using prospective data observed that neither obesity and overweight can predict anxiety, but only in males, partially observed that anxiety can predict overweight and obesity [42]. Another study also indicated that an effect can result in overweight and obesity in boys [43].\nStudies with adolescents indicate that the bi-directionality of mental disorders with obesity and overweight still demonstrates the need for further investigation. These studies also doubt whether mental disorders can lead the individual to gain weight or obesity, whether obesity can trigger anxiety and depression disorders or whether such associations do not occur without this bidirectional trend [37, 44, 45]. In contrast, the study by Fox et al. [45], for example, investigated the association between these variables with a sample of morbidly obese adolescents and observed up to 3.5 times greater chances of developing depression and almost 5 of developing anxiety than individuals with mild obesity.\nThe study was carried out with a national sample of children and adolescents in Sweden [36] with greater control for factors that could interfere with the associations and positive outcomes between obesity and depression and anxiety observed that anxiety and depression cause emotional and physiological factors that can make treatment difficult. Specific genetic conditions, acquired pathologies, sedentary lifestyle, socioeconomic aspects, inadequate eating habits, traumas and psycho-emotional influences can influence body composition or interfere with human emotional vibration [36, 45]. From this perspective, there is an understanding that the relationship between anxiety, depression and obesity is transdirectional, because it involves multifactorial aspects that go beyond the aforementioned bidirectionality. Only the individual diagnosis can accurately define the true origin of the problem, which is one more way for future discussions and explanations of the results found in this study. Perhaps the heterogeneity of depression and the multifactorial profile of obesity are factors that favor the transdirectionality of this process [46].\nRegarding the results of comparisons with the sample divided by sex and in groups of physically active and inactive, different contexts may explain the fact that significant results are only found between groups of girls and boys. Without a number of studies that can provide evidence for the effects of physical activity/exercise on depression and anxiety, physical activity, when performed with moderate intensity can bring greater adherence and beneficial impacts [47, 48]. A population-based study with a large sample of Canadian adolescents and with control of different varieties suggested that individuals with less than one physical activity practice per week were at greater risk of reaching higher levels of anxiety and depression, different from those who practiced physical activity at least once a week [49]. Physical activity has been studied as a psychosocial buffer against symptoms of depression and anxiety, as it can provide social support, increase self-esteem, and generate a sense of accomplishment [50]. A study of adolescents in Sweden found that regular\nparticipation in leisure-time physical activities was associated with low levels of depressive symptoms [51]. In this study, those who practiced more than 300 minutes of physical activity per week were considered physically active [52]. However, the comparisons showed that boys had a longer weekly time of physical activity, and it seems that between the sexes, this variable is important in addition to possible explanations about the differences between boys and girls about mental health [39].\nComparisons with depression and anxiety as independent variables, practice time of physical activity and overweight as dependent variables, and sex as control did not demonstrate significant results and reinforce those new investigations with different methodological designs and more robust control variables are required [34, 35]. This study, for example, presents as limitations the lack of control variables such as socioeconomic level, obesity, type and intensity of physical activity, etc. There was no calculation of sample size and the sample was chosen by convenience."

Depression, as it is considered a mental disorder with risks even of death, should continue to be investigated in both sexes. Although the variables depression, anxiety, overweight, and practice of physical activity have no associations, the multifactorial influence observed in other studies indicates that future investigations must be carried out and demonstrates that a detailed assessment must be carried out on each individual in the clinical practice of cases of anxiety and depression."
