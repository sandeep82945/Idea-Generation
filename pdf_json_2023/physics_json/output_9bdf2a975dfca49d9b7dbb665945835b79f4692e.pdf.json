    "abstractText": "Protein import and oxidative folding within the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria relies on the MIA40\u2013ERV1 couple. The MIA40 oxidoreductase usually performs substrate recognition and oxidation and is then regenerated by the FAD-dependent oxidase ERV1. In most eukaryotes, both proteins are essential; however, MIA40 is dispensable in Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous complementation experiments have studied yeast mia40 mutants expressing a redox inactive, but import-competent versions of yeast Mia40 using A. thaliana ERV1 (AtERV1) suggest that AtERV1 catalyzes the oxidation of MIA40 substrates. We assessed the ability of both yeast and Arabidopsis MIA40 and ERV1 recombinant proteins to oxidize the apo-cytochrome reductase CCMH and the cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein COX19, a typical MIA40 substrate, in the presence or absence of glutathione, using in vitro cysteine alkylation and cytochrome c reduction assays. The presence of glutathione used at a physiological concentration and redox potential was sufficient to support the oxidation of COX19 by AtERV1, providing a likely explanation for why MIA40 is not essential for the import and oxidative folding of IMS-located proteins in Arabidopsis. The results point to fundamental biochemical differences between Arabidopsis and yeast ERV1 in catalyzing protein oxidation.",

            "text": "Mitochondria are essential organelles, carrying out many crucial cellular pathways such as ATP production, apoptosis, iron\u2013sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis, and ion homeostasis. Mitochondria are formed by two aqueous compartments, the matrix and the intermembrane space (IMS), separated by two biological membranes, the outer membrane (OM) and the inner membrane (IM). Among the ~1000 proteins present in this organelle, 51 and 127 proteins have been reported as present in the IMS of yeast and human mitochondria, respectively [1\u20133]. After their translation in the cytosol, the import of IMS-located proteins relies on at least three distinct pathways [4,5]. The predominant pathway allows both this import and oxidative folding [4]. Many proteins using this pathway are characterized by the presence of two repeated Cx3C (for TIM proteins) or Cx9C (for COX proteins) motifs [6,7], but other proteins (Atp23, CCS1, MICU, and SLP2) with particular cysteine motifs have proven to also be imported using this pathway [8\u201312]. The import and oxidative folding of these protein substrates is ensured by a pair of proteins referred to as the oxidoreductase Mitochondrial Intermembrane space import and Assembly protein 40 (MIA40) and the Essential for Respiration and Vegetative growth (ERV1) [13,14]. The former introduces disulfide bonds in protein substrates and is regenerated by the latter. The core structure of MIA40 is formed by two disulfide-bridged helices forming a hydrophobic cleft important for substrate recognition, and an N-terminal flexible arm containing the catalytic cysteines present in a CPC motif [7,15,16]. Three different models have been proposed to describe the molecular interactions between MIA40 and its\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1949. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12111949 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1949 2 of 14\nsubstrates [17]. In the folding trap model, protein translocation into the IMS is dependent on the formation of disulfides on MIA40 substrates, preventing back-translocation into the cytosol. In the two so-called \u201ctrans-site receptor\u201d models, substrate trapping is ensured initially by the hydrophobic domain of MIA40 but requires the oxidase activity of MIA40, either concomitantly or in a further separate step [7,17]. The hydrophobic cleft interacts with specific recognition sequences present in MIA40 substrates, referred to as MISS or ITS (for Mitochondrial IMS-Sorting Signal and Intermembrane space Targeting Signal, respectively) [18\u201320]. These specific motifs formed by hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids are situated in close proximity to the Cx3C or Cx9C motifs. After this initial step of recognition, the substrates are oxidized by the catalytic cysteine pair of MIA40, promoting their folding and retention in the IMS [7,21]. All of these proposed models agree in their idea that MIA40 is finally released in a reduced form after substrate oxidation. Its re-oxidation is achieved by the homodimeric FAD-dependent thiol oxidase, ERV1. Most ERV1 isoforms possess two conserved cysteine pairs forming intramolecular disulfides. An exposed disulfide (shuttle disulfide) catalyzes the oxidation of the CPC disulfide of MIA40 [22\u201325] and is then regenerated by the disulfide present in the central domain of the second monomer. Electrons are then shuttled to the FAD cofactor, to cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase [26\u201330]. While the core domain of ERV1 proteins from different species is relatively well conserved, a noticeable difference exists among them. In opisthokonts, the catalytic disulfide is formed by cysteines present in a Cx2C motif found in the N-terminal part of ERV1, whereas it is formed between cysteines present in a Cx3\u20135C motif found in the C-terminal part in isoforms from plants and protists [31,32]. Proteins from protists have an additional KISS domain located between the FAD central domain and the catalytic domain [33]. In opisthokonts, both MIA40 and ERV1 have proven to be essential as knock-out mutants in yeast or in animal cells are lethal [16,34,35]. Only a few human patients bearing mutations affecting these proteins have been reported and they present severe diseases such as myopathy and neuronal cell degeneration [36]. The mutation of ERV1 is also lethal in Arabidopsis thaliana and in the protist Leishmania infantum [31,32]. However, several protists, including apicomplexan and kinetoplastid parasites, lack MIA40 [32,33]. Moreover, an Arabidopsis mia40 mutant displays no growth phenotype, despite a slight decrease in complex I activity [37]. From a functional point of view, ERV1 proteins from these parasites could not functionally substitute the essential ERV1 in yeast [38] and Trypanosoma brucei ERV1 is unable to directly oxidize a small TIM protein in vitro [39]. This is different for Arabidopsis ERV1, since it partially complements the yeast erv1 mutant [40]. It was shown that AtERV1 and ScMia40 interact together in vivo but that AtERV1 is unable to oxidize ScMia40 properly [40]. These incompatibilities have been explained by the structural divergence between ERV1 isoforms [31,40]. Accordingly, chimeric ERV1 proteins combining the N-terminal domain of yeast Erv1 and the core domain of Leishmania tarentolae ERV, thus mimicking the yeast Erv1 structural architecture, were able to complement the yeast erv1 mutant [32]. The question of whether parasite and plant ERV1 proteins might exert the function of MIA40 was addressed by complementing mia40 yeast cells. Whereas none of the tested truncated, chimeric or mutated ERV constructs from L. tarentolae were able to rescue these cells, AtERV1 could when a redox-inactive but chaperone-competent MIA40 protein was co-expressed [40]. Altogether, these observations suggested that AtERV1 was able to directly oxidize MIA40 substrates to some extent, as long as they are imported. Incidentally, this suggested that a non-redox-active receptor protein might be required in organisms lacking MIA40. Alternatively, a recent study identified Mic20, a thioredoxin-like protein belonging to the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organization system (MICOS) complex, as a potential candidate functionally replacing MIA40 in kinetoplastid parasites [41]. However, the protein was not identified in the interactome of L. tarentolae ERV and does not seem to be present in all protist lineages lacking MIA40 [42]. In order to further examine the biochemical properties of the plant ERV1-MIA40 system, we have compared the capacity of the A. thaliana and S. cerevisiae ERV1 to oxidize\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1949 3 of 14\nin vitro the Arabidopsis cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis factor COX19 in the presence or absence of the respective MIA40 proteins, but also CCMH, a reductase dedicated to the reduction of apo-cytochrome c in the IMS. Moreover, from the reports indicating that glutathione improves protein import both in vivo and in vitro by counteracting, in particular, the formation of long-lived or unproductive MIA40-substrate covalent intermediates [14,43], the possible contribution of glutathione was examined in these in vitro assays."

It was then cloned in the pET15b plasmid between NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, allowing the production of an N-terminal His-tagged protein. The protein was expressed in the E. coli Origami2 strain, cultivated at 37 \u25e6C in LB medium, and protein production was induced in exponential phases by adding 100 \u00b5M IPTG (isopropyl-\u03b2-Dthiogalactopyranoside) for 4 h before collecting by centrifugation bacterial cells, which were resuspended in a 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole buffer. Cell lysis and IMAC protein purification of His-tagged COX19 was performed using a procedure similar to the one previously described for other proteins [44]. The mutagenesis of both cysteines present in the CERC and CEQKSC active sites of AtERV1 into serines was carried out by primer extension using the following two complementary mutagenic primers: AtERV1 SERS for 5\u2032 TCCCGAATGTATCCTTCTAGAGAATCTGCGGATCACTTCAAA 3\u2032, AtERV1 SERS rev 5\u2032 TTTGAAGTGATCCGCAGATTCTCTAGAAGGATACATTCGGGA 3\u2032, AtERV1 SEQKSS for 5\u2032 TGGGGCAAGTTAGAGTCTGAGCAGAAAAGTTCTGATCTCCATGGAACT 3\u2032, and AtERV1 SEQKSS rev 5\u2032 AGTTCCATGGAGATCAGAACTTTTCTGCTCAGACTCTAACTTGCCCCA 3\u2032.

The yeast and Arabidopsis MIA40 and ERV1 proteins were expressed in the regular E. coli BL21(DE3) strain, whereas AtCOX19 was expressed in the more oxidizing cytoplasmic compartment of the E. coli Origami2 strain. Nonetheless, all proteins were purified in their oxidized forms. Since AtCOX19 has proven to be resistant to reduction and to re-oxidize quite quickly, its reduction was achieved with a 50-fold excess of DTT for 4 h. It is worth noting that AtCOX19 possesses four cysteinyl residues forming two intramolecular disulfides. Two types of in vitro assays have been carried out. The first method measured AtCOX19 oxidation in a coupled assay by measuring cytochrome c reduction at 550 nm over time with catalytic amounts of ERV1 and/or MIA40. Using similar reaction mixtures, the second method assessed the AtCOX19 redox state after cysteine alkylation and separation on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. In this assay, only the reduced cysteine residues were accessible for modification. This resulted in a change in the migration profile that allows distinguishing different redox forms, i.e., completely reduced or with one or two intramolecular disulfides. For comparison, both assays were performed in the same time frame. In the cytochrome c reduction assay, it became apparent that AtERV1 has no or a very poor capacity to oxidize AtCOX19 (Figures 1A and S1), the presence of AtMIA40 being critical to reach a good oxidation efficiency, as compared with the control test performed using DTT instead of AtCOX19 and both AtERV1 and AtMIA40 proteins. The same conclusion arose from the alkylation shift assay (Figure 1B).

            "text": "While the in vitro results shown in Figure 1 point to the requirement of a redox-active AtMIA40 for AtCOX19 oxidation by AtERV1, previous observations indicated that AtERV1 was able to complement a yeast mia40 mutant expressing a redox-inactive Mia40 and suggested the existence of an oxidase activity of AtERV1. We hypothesize that a redox component could be missing in our in vitro assays when compared with the yeast cellular context. It was shown that a glutathione pool is present in the IMS, equilibrating with the cytosolic glutathione pool due to the passive exchange of GSH via porins [47]. In fact, rather elevated glutathione concentrations (5 to 13 mM) exist in the IMS, with measured\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1949 6 of 14\nredox potentials comprised between \u2212255 and \u2212300 mM in yeast cells and of ca \u2212290 mV in human cells [14,47\u201349]. Also, the GSH pool influences the MIA40 redox state, although MIA40 is only slowly reduced by GSH [43,47]. With regard to the report stating that low amounts of Grx2 are present in the mitochondrial IMS of yeast, it was proposed that Grx2 mediates this GSH effect [50,51]. Hence, the presence of these components may ensure some sort of proofreading activity for misfolded proteins or avoiding protein misfolding at the import step [43], in a way somehow similar to the oxidative protein folding occurring in the ER, a process in which protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) activity is assisted by GSH [52]. Nevertheless, contrasting observations exist. While some in vivo and in vitro studies have indeed shown positive effects of GSH [14,43], other studies have reached the opposite conclusion: that GSH inhibits the import and/or oxidation of some MIA40 substrates [53]. This might indicate that changes in the concentrations and redox state of glutathione are likely critical factors for in vivo, but also for in vitro, assays. The impact of glutathione on AtCOX19 oxidation was thus examined over a longer period, typically 3 h, to reach equilibrium, using a concentration of 8 mM and a GSH/GSSG ratio corresponding to a redox potential of \u2212274 mV at pH 7.4. The timeframe and redox potential of the glutathione were chosen based on previous studies (see above) and were somehow imposed by the presence of 0.25% GSSG in freshly prepared GSH solutions. At these values, a significant oxidation of AtCOX19 occurred when only glutathione was present, with the fully oxidized form representing ca 40% of the total AtCOX19 at the end of this experiment (Figure 2A). Hence, the low amounts of GSSG and/or the combination of GSH and O2 was, to some extent, sufficient to introduce both disulfides in AtCOX19. Then, the impact of this GSH/GSSG buffering solution was assayed in the presence of the yeast (Figure 2B) and Arabidopsis (Figure 2C) MIA40\u2013ERV1 couples. ScErv1 was unable to oxidize AtCOX19 in the presence of glutathione and the reaction still required ScMia40 (around 90% of AtCOX19 oxidation after 30 min, as observed in Figure 1). On the contrary, AtERV1 was able to oxidize AtCOX19 in the presence of glutathione (80% of oxidized AtCOX19 after 3 h) and the reaction was not improved by the presence of AtMIA40 (Figure 2C). Overall, unlike yeast proteins, there is a clear effect of GSH on Arabidopsis MIA40\u2013ERV1 oxidizing properties, with GSH or GSSG supporting ERV1 oxidase activity and maybe counteracting MIA40 activity. In this respect, it would also be informative to measure the redox potential of the MIA40 catalytic disulfide. By comparing it with the one of glutathione in the IMS of plant mitochondria, it may help to determine to which extent MIA40 is oxidized in plant cells. A recent study concluded that the in vivo redox state of Mia40 at steady-state in yeast cells is about 70% oxidized and that it is influenced both by Erv1 and glutathione [47].\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1949 7 of 14Antioxidants 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 14\npossesses a pair of catalytic cysteines, present in a Cx2CH motif, that allows apo-cytochrome c reduction before heme incorporation [45].

Using the same read-outs (cytochrome c reduction and cysteine alkylation assays) (Figure 3A,B), we observed that AtERV1 was unable to oxidize AtCCMH and that adding AtMIA40 resulted in very inefficient reactions, as most AtCCMH remained in a reduced state after 1 h.

This unexpected observation should not (or not only) correspond to a better efficiency of ScErv1 to oxidize AtMIA40, but may indicate that ScErv1 participates in the oxidation reaction by acting on AtCCMH, AtMIA40, or both, thus promoting MIA40 activity. It has been proposed in some studies that ternary complexes are formed in yeast involving Erv1, Mia40, and the substrate [55,56].\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1949 8 of 14\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 14\nproposed in some studies that ternary complexes are formed in yeast involving Erv1, Mia40, and the substrate [55,56].\n3.4.

Very similar values were obtained for all proteins at pH 7, i.e., \u2212295 mV for AtMIA40, \u2212290 mV for the shuttle disulfide of AtERV1, and \u2212280 mV for the internal disulfide of AtERV1 (Figure 4).

            "heading": "4. Conclusions",
            "text": "The results presented in this study highlight the specificities of the plant ERV1\u2013MIA40 pathway towards GSH and two IMS proteins, COX19 and CCMH. It is first interesting to note that the Arabidopsis ERV1\u2013MIA40 couple is not able to oxidize CCMH well. This may explain why no reducing system has been identified in plants so far, unlike in bacteria such as E. coli, where reduction of the periplasmic ortholog is assisted by CcmG using electrons coming from the cytoplasm and transferred via the membrane CcdA protein [59]. One of the differences between these systems is the presence of high GSH concentrations in the IMS and, eventually, of glutaredoxins, although this remains to be established for plants. The next step may be to verify the capacity of GSH in vitro, alone or with glutaredoxin, to reduce CCMH. The second important conclusion is the observation that the in vitro requirement of MIA40 for COX19 oxidation is abolished when ERV1 and physiological concentrations of glutathione provided at a relevant redox potential are present. The capacity of AtERV1 to bypass the AtMIA40 function in vitro may actually explain why AtERV1 was able to complement a yeast mia40 mutant, restoring the amount of MIA40 substrates [40], and why the role of AtMIA40 is dispensable in A. thaliana, but not in opisthokonts.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antiox12111949/s1, Figure S1: In vitro oxidation of Arabidopsis COX19 protein by the ERV1-MIA40 couple from Arabidopsis thaliana or Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Figure S2: In vitro oxidation of Arabidopsis CCMH by the ERV1-MIA40 couple from Arabidopsis thaliana or Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.Z., J.M.H. and N.R.; methodology, F.Z.; validation, J.C. and N.R.; data curation, F.Z., J.C. and N.R.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.Z. and N.R.; writing\u2014review and editing, F.Z., J.M.H., J.C. and N.R.; supervision, J.C. and N.R.; project administration, N.R.; funding acquisition, N.R.
