    "abstractText": "Two new inorganic-organic hybrid crystals based on PbI2 were assembled through the solvent evaporation method, namely, {[L1]\u00b7[Pb2I6]}n (1) and {[L2]2\u00b7[Pb3I10]}n (2). L1-L2 are a series of multivalent nitrogen-containing cationic ligands. Compounds 1\u20132 were characterized by singlecrystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, FT-IR, powder X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric microanalysis. The results showed that the adsorption rate of 80 mg compound 1 to iodine reached 96.59%, indicating a high iodine capture performance in cyclohexane solution. In the meantime, the adsorption kinetics is most suitable for a pseudo-second-order model, and the adsorption process is mainly chemisorption. Adsorption thermodynamics is most suitable for the Langmuir model, indicating that adsorption occurs on the surface of the monolayer. According to the adsorption mechanism, it can be inferred that the structure of compound 1 contains amino, benzene, N heterocyclic, and other active groups, that is, indirectly increases the adsorption site with iodine, and the chemical reaction with iodine improves the removal rate of iodine in cyclohexane solution. In addition, compound 1 was found to have good iodine adsorption and recyclability by cyclic experiments. Therefore, the synthesized compound 1 can be used as a potential and excellent iodide capture adsorbent, which may have a good application prospects in the future.",

            "text": "In the foreseeable future, nuclear energy as a green, clean, and sustainable emerging energy source will continue to provide energy and attract more widespread attention. However, the tragic cost of the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011 once again aroused worldwide attention toward the disposal of nuclear waste [1], especially the disposal of radioactive iodine produced in the process of nuclear fission [2]. With an extremely long half-life of 1.57 \u00d7 107 years, 129I poses a long-term environmental risk due to bioaccumulation [3,4]. In contrast, 131I has a shorter half-life of 8.02 days, but it poses a significant risk to human health [5\u20138]. Because both 129I and 131I are highly volatile, they can quickly disperse in the air and water and destroy the earth\u2019s ecosystem. Through the enrichment of the food chain, radioactive iodine continues to enter the human body and participate in human metabolism, causing thyroid damage and even cancer [9\u201311]. In addition, radioactive iodine combined with volatile organic materials can cause irreversible damage to the central nervous system [12]. Moreover, many chemical and pharmaceutical enterprises are also facing the problem of iodine wastewater and waste gas treatment. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to explore and develop safe, efficient, and economical repositories to capture and isolate ions and neutral iodine residues [13]. Adsorption technology is a simple way to reconcentrate pollutants, and it remains one of the most hopeful means to reduce the release of iodine [14]. At present, the most common method of iodine capture that has been developed and adopted is the solid capture method. The applied solid adsorbents are mainly activated carbon, silica, silver-based\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2934. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28072934 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2934 2 of 14\nmaterials, metal-organic framework, etc. [15\u201317]. However, these adsorbents are limited by some factors. Although activated carbon and silica have the advantages of high capacity and availability [10], their limited accessible surface area leads to a low capacity of iodine capture. Recently, researchers have discovered that silver-based materials [18] can be used for vapor iodine capture and storage, but silver cannot be widely used due to its high price, strong toxicity, and limited adsorption capacity [19]. Metal-organic skeleton materials are unstable under wet conditions. Therefore, the development of novel adsorbents with higher thermal and chemical stability for iodine capture remains a challenge. In recent years, supramolecular chemistry has developed rapidly. A large number of inorganic\u2013organic hybrid crystals with novel structures have been reported, and researchers began to pay attention to the improvement of their practical application value [20\u201327]. Supramolecular materials combine the stability of inorganic materials and the adjustability of organic materials, which gives organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials unique advantages in the field of iodine molecular enrichment [12]. Some electron-rich groups, such as \u2212NH, \u2212NH2, \u2212C=N\u2212, heterocyclic (S, P), aromatic ring, and so on, can adsorb electron-deficient I2 by forming charge transfer complexes, so as to improve the adsorption capacity and adsorption rate by adjusting the adsorption dynamics between organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials modified with electron-rich functional groups and iodine [28]. Our research group has been engaged in the preparation and performance research of supramolecular compounds for a long time [29\u201337]. Herein, we attempt to get compounds with certain expected structures through a self-assembly reaction between self-designed organic ligands and selected metal sources and use them to study the adsorption of iodine. The choice of ligands has a crucial influence on the structure and function of compounds. In the design of organic ligands, we consider multivalent nitrogen-containing cationic ligands L1\u2013L2 (Scheme 1). The introduction of amino functional groups into the ligand is beneficial to enhance the affinity between the adsorbent and iodine, thus improving its iodine adsorption capacity. In recent years, lead iodide (PbI2) has attracted much attention because of its high atomic coefficient, wide band gap, high resistivity, and carrier mobility lifetime, which make it an ideal material for the preparation of roomtemperature X-ray and \u03b3-ray detectors. Lead iodide crystal is a promising material for room-temperature nuclear radiation detectors. As a new type of room-temperature nuclear radiation detector, it can be widely used in the fields of environmental monitoring, nuclear medicine, nondestructive testing, nuclear weapons penetration, aerospace, astrophysics, and high-energy physics [38\u201340]. In this research, we used PbI2 as the selected metal source to react with multivalent nitrogen-containing cationic ligands (L1\u2013L2) to obtain compounds 1\u20132 by solvent evaporation at room temperature. We used compounds 1\u20132 as adsorbents to explore the iodine adsorption performance in cyclohexane solution. It is worth mentioning that compound 1 exhibits high iodine adsorption performance.

(a) UV\u2212vis spectra of cyclohexane solutions with different iodine concentrations; (b) Standard curve of cyclohexane solution of iodine at 523 nm.\nIn order to analyze the iodine adsorption effect of the synthesized compounds, the influence of the amount of adsorbent on the iodine removal efficiency was studied. Compounds at different doses (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg) were added to the iodocyclohexane solution. After being placed at room temperature for 6 h, it was found through the experimental phenomenon that the iodocyclohexane solution was observed to be colorless from imperial purple as the adsorption time went on (Figure 5a\u2013d). Compounds 1\u20132 changed from yellow to dark green after absorbing iodine. The concentration of iodine solution was determined by UV-VIS spectroscopy (Figure 5e,g), and the removal rates of iodine were calculated. The corresponding iodine removal rates by compound 1 were 42.07%, 53.14%, 80.40%, and 96.59% (Figure 5f); and the adsorption removal rates of compound 2 for iodine were 31.89%, 40.08%, 51.14%, and 79.6%. The comparative experimental results showed that compound 1 had a better adsorption effect on iodine than compound 2. From the structure of the compounds, it was inferred that Pb2+ in compound 1 had only one five-coordinated mode, while Pb2+ in compound 2 had two coordination modes: five and six-coordination. In compound 2, Pb2+ has more coordination modes for the iodine atom, which leads to that compound 2 having a less effective adsorption effect on iodine molecules than compound 1. Therefore, relatively speaking, compound 1 has better adsorption performance for iodine, and 80 mg compound 1 has the best adsorption effect on iodine, which may be because the number of active sites in contact with iodine increases with the increase in the number of adsorbents, to improve the adsorption efficiency. At the same time, after adding 80 mg compound to absorb iodine, the concentration of residual iodine in the solution reached 13.64 mg/L. It can be found that the concentration of residual iodine after the treatment of compound 1 is very low. The adsorption efficiency of compounds 1\u20132 is comparable with some reported two-dimensional materials in cyclohexane solution. Zhang et al. successfully prepared a unique thorium MOF (metal-organic framework) ThTTHA with a thorium oxide wheel cluster by using thorium nitrate and a semirigid triazine hexarboxylic acid ligand H6TTHA (H6TTHA = 1, 3, 5-triazine-2, 4, 6-triamine hexaacetic acid) under solvothermal synthesis. After 6 h adsorption in cyclohexane, the removal efficiency of iodine by 100 mg Th-TTHA reached 50.75% [41].

            "text": "3.4.1. Iodine Sorption Study\nIn order to study the iodine adsorption capacity of the compounds in cyclohexane solution, a simulation experiment was conducted. The specific experimental process is as follows: Firstly, 500 mg\u00b7L\u22121 iodo-cyclohexane solution was prepared, 80 mg compound was added into 10 mL iodo-cyclohexane solution, and the solution was standing at room temperature. The color change of iodo-cyclohexane solution was observed during adsorption, and the removal rate of iodine was evaluated by UV-VIS spectrum. The iodine removal efficiency (RE; %) and the adsorption capacity (qe; mg\u00b7g\u22121) of the compound were calculated by Equations (1) and (2), respectively [47].\nRE(%) = (\n1\u2212 Ct C0\n) \u00d7 100% (1)\nqe = (C0 \u2212 Ce)\u00d7V\nm (2)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2934 11 of 14\nwhere C0 is the initial concentrations (mg\u00b7L\u22121) of iodine; Ce is the equilibrium concentrations (mg\u00b7L\u22121) of iodine; Ct is the iodine concentrations (mg\u00b7L\u22121) at time t; V is the volume (L) of iodo-cyclohexane solution; and m is the compound weight (g).\n3.4.2. Kinetic Studies\nIn order to further understand the adsorption of iodine by compounds, the pseudofirst-order kinetic model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model were used to fit the experimental results and determine the actual situation of iodine adsorption. The nonlinear forms of the quasi-first-order and quasi-second-order dynamics models are defined by Equations (3) and (4) [48], respectively:\nlg(qe \u2212 qt) = \u2212 K f\n2.303 t + lgqe (3)\nt qt = 1 qe t + 1 Ksq2e (4)\nwhere qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity (mg\u00b7g\u22121) of the adsorbent; qt is the adsorption capacity (mg\u00b7g\u22121) of the adsorbent at time t; Kf is the pseudo-first-order model rate constants of adsorption (min\u22121); Ks is the pseudo-second-order model rate constants of adsorption (g\u00b7mg\u22121\u00b7min).\n3.4.3. Models of Adsorption Isotherm\nThe adsorption isotherm is very important to understand the nature of the specific relationship between adsorbing material and adsorbent. Langmuir\u2019s isothermal adsorption model is a single molecular layer adsorption model, and Freundlich\u2019s isothermal adsorption\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2934 12 of 14\nmodel is a multi-molecular layer adsorption model.

            "text": "In summary, two new supramolecular compounds 1\u20132 were synthesized through the solvent evaporation method. They were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectrum, powder X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. Experimental results show that compound 1 exhibits high iodine capture performance in cyclohexane solution. The removal rate of iodide from cyclohexane solution reached 96.59% with 80 mg of compound 1. We speculated that the synthesized compound 1 contained amino, benzene, N heterocyclic, and other active groups, which could interact with iodine and improve the ability of compound 1 to capture iodine in cyclohexane solution, indicating that the synthesized material has a good application prospect for iodine adsorption. The mechanism of iodine adsorption by compound 1 was investigated, and it is found that the adsorption kinetics fit the quasi-first-order model best, and adsorption thermodynamics fit the Langmuir model best. The synthesized compound 1 can be used as a potential and excellent iodine capture adsorbent. In the subsequent study, we can explore the adsorption performance of compound 1 on other pollutants. The capture experiments of iodine in solution with various ions and materials similar to the real sample and in an aqueous solution are on the way.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.Z., J.L. and Y.N.; software, X.Z. and J.L.; validation, X.Z. and J.L.; formal analysis, J.L. and Y.N.; investigation, X.Z. and J.L.; supervision, Y.N.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, X.Z., J.L. and Y.N.
