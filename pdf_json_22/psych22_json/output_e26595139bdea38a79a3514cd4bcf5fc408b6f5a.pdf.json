The voice pitch or speaking fundamental frequency (Fo) and the vocal formant frequencies are the voice parameters most intensively studied in research on the perception of body size (particularly height).

In the present study, we tested and extended this research using connected speech (sentences, words) pronounced by speakers of both sexes.

Among several voice parameters, both vocal formants and speaking fundamental frequency (pitch) predict the considerable variation in body size between humans of different ages and sexes (Peterson & Barney, 1952; Titze, 1989). However, when individual differences in body size are controlled by age and sex variables (e.g., adults of the same sex), only formants reliably predict speaker\u2019s size (Gonz\u00e1lez, 2004, 2006; Pisanski, Fraccaro, Tigue, O'Connor, & Feinberg, 2014a; Pisanski et al., 2014b). The formants are the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract and are dependent on the size of the vocal tube (Fant, 1960). As the vocal tract length (VTL) is larger, the formant frequencies are lower, and vice versa. Vocal tract is constrained to some extent by anatomical structures related to body size (e.g., individual\u2019s skull and body height). Consequently, a negative correlation exists between formant frequencies and speaker\u2019s body size, although its value is moderate in general terms (Bruckert, Li\u00e9nard, Lacroix, Kreutzer, & Leboucher, 2006; Gonz\u00e1lez, 2004, 2006; Pisanski et al., 2014b). Conversely, the correlation between pitch, or speaking fundamental frequency (Fo), and body size among adults of the same sex is very weak, or virtually null (Bruckert et al., 2006; Gonz\u00e1lez, 2007; K\u00fcnzel, 1989; Pisanski et al., 2014b; van Dommelen & Moxness, 1995). Pitch is produced by vocal folds, which are composed of a soft tissue not subject to the same anatomical constraints than vocal formants.\nListeners can roughly infer the speaker\u2019s body size (specifically the body height) based\n(correctly) on the formant frequencies of his/her voice. Unexpectedly, research has shown that listeners incorrectly infer the speaker\u2019s height among adults of the same sex based on the pitch or\nPage 2 of 21\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pms\nPerceptual and Motor Skills\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nfundamental frequency (Fo) of her/his voice. Listeners consistently associate low speaking Fo with tall people, and, conversely, high Fo with short people (Feinberg, Jones, Little, Burt, & Perrett, 2005; Pisanski & Rendall, 2011; Pisanski et al., 2014b; van Dommelen & Moxness, 1995). Presumably, this association could be the result of an erroneous overgeneralization of the physical principle that large or long objects produce low frequency vibrations and small or short objects give rise to higher vibrations. This extrapolation is wrong because, as mentioned above, the size of the vocal cords is hardly related to the body size among adults of the same sex.\nGiven the absence of an objective link between voice pitch and body size at the within-sex\nlevel, pitch has traditionally been hypothesized that its presence in the human voice could make it difficult to correctly perceive the speaker\u2019s body size from the vocal formant frequencies. Pisanski, et al. (2014a) performed a direct test of how the accuracy of listeners\u2019 judgments is affected when voice pitch is present or absent from the acoustical signal. Counterintuitively, they found the listeners\u2019 accuracy increased in the presence rather than absence of voice pitch in the experimental stimuli. More specifically, height estimations based on relatively low voice pitch achieved higher accuracy. These authors hypothesized that the denser harmonic spectrum provided by low pitch allowed for better resolution of formants, aiding listeners in extracting reliable formant-based information from the voice. They tested this hypothesis (Exp. 3) and verified that artificially lowering the fundamental frequency of voice with the help of technology facilitated assessments of men\u2019s body height.\nPisanski, et al. (2014a, Exp. 3) employed the five Canadian English monophthong vowels\n(/\u0251/, /i/, /\u03b5/, /o/, and /u/) recorded from thirty men as experimental stimuli, and subsequently, their fundamental frequency was manipulated using the PSOLA algorithm of Praat software (Boersma & Weenink, 2013) maintaining formants constant. The aim of the present work was to\nPage 3 of 21\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pms\nPerceptual and Motor Skills\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nextend this research in relation to several relevant aspects: a) using connected speech (sentences, words) as experimental study, beyond isolated vowels; b) using voices of men and women; and c) using materials from another linguistic context (Spanish).\nEXPERIMENT 1\nThe purpose of Experiment 1 was to observe the effect of lowering or raising the\nfundamental frequency of a sentence spoken by men and women in assessments of speakers\u2019 body size.\nMETHOD Participants. Participants as listeners were 68 young adults of both sexes (57 females) whose age range\nwas 18\u201330 years (M = 19.67; SD = 2.52). All participants were undergraduate students at the University Jaume I (Spain), who participated voluntarily with informed consent and were compensated with course credit.\nMaterials The stimuli consisted of a Spanish interrogative sentence (\u2018\u00bfCu\u00e1ntos a\u00f1os tiene tu primo de\nBarcelona?\u2019 [How old is your cousin from Barcelona?]) recorded from 40 young adult speakers, 20 men and 20 women, who had been university students several years ago, unknown to the participants. Voices were selected from a pool of voice recordings (Gonz\u00e1lez & Oliver, 2005), whose speakers had their height measured with a metric tape. The range of heights of the selected male speakers was 160-189 cm, with an average M = 176.9 cm (\u00b1 SD = 6.3 cm), close to the general population of Spanish men (176.6 cm; NCDRISC, 2018). The range of heights of\nPage 4 of 21\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pms\nPerceptual and Motor Skills\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nthe selected female speakers was 154-175 cm, with an average M = 163.4 cm (\u00b1 SD = 7.5 cm), very close to the general population of Spanish women (163.4 cm; NCDRISC, 2018).\nThe sentence was recorded in a sound-attenuated booth with a Shure SM58 microphone at\nan approximate distance of 12 cm from the mouth, and a Sony-TCD D-8 digital audiotape (DAT) recorder with a sample frequency of 44.1 kHz. Then, the speech signal was digitally transferred to a PC computer and converted to 16-bit WAV files. Finally, the files were equated in RMS (root mean square) amplitude.\nManipulation of the Fundamental Frequency (Fo). We used three sets of stimuli: the natural\nspeech recordings above mentioned (\u2018Normal\u2019), the natural recordings with their Fo lowered (\u2018Low\u2019), and the natural recordings with their Fo raised (\u2018High\u2019). Following the same procedure as Pisanski, et al. (2014a, Exp. 3), \u2018Low\u2019 stimuli were the natural recordings manipulated by means of PSOLA algorithm of Praat software (Boersma & Weenink, 2016) to subtract 0.5 ERBs of the baseline Fo, maintaining formants constant. \u2018High\u201d stimuli were obtained in the same way adding 0.5 ERBs to the baseline Fo. PSOLA (Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add) is a digital signal processing technique initially proposed by Moulines & Charpentier (1990) and used for manipulating the pitch (or time) of an acoustic speech signal, without altering other parameters. PSOLA decomposes the speech waveform in small overlapping segments, and moves them further apart to decrease Fo, or closer together to increase Fo. ERB or equivalent rectangular bandwidth is a measure used in psychoacoustics, which gives an approximation of the perceived voice pitch. For example, adding or subtracting 0.5 ERB to 120 Hz is roughly equivalent to adding or subtracting 20 Hz.\nPairing of speech stimuli. We created a total of 240 pairs of stimuli, 40 for each Fo\ncondition (Low, Normal, High) x speaker\u2019s sex (males, females). Each pair was formed by two\nPage 5 of 21\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pms\nPerceptual and Motor Skills\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\ndifferent stimuli belonging to the same Fo condition and speaker\u2019s sex, separated by 800 ms of silence. Normal/male condition was formed by 40 different pairs of male speakers, whose heights differed in a range of 5 \u2013 19 cm (M = 9.3 cm, SD = 3.9 cm); half of the pairs included the taller man in the first place, and half in the second place. Normal/female condition was formed by 40 different pairs of female speakers, whose heights differed in a range of 9 \u2013 17 cm (M = 13.9 cm, SD = 3.0 cm); half of the pairs included the taller woman in the first place, and half in the second place. The pairs were the same for the other two Fo conditions, Low and High.\nThe total of 240 pairs was divided in four sets of 60 pairs (10 per each Fo x speaker sex\ncondition), ensuring that neither pair of speakers was repeated through the Fo conditions within the same set.\nProcedure Each participant was randomly assigned to one of the four sets of stimuli, resulting in a total\nof 60 size assessment trials per each participant. Participants individually performed the experiment in six short sessions of ten stimuli of the same Fo/speaker sex condition. The order of the sessions was randomized through the participants. At the beginning of each session, participants were informed if the speakers were men or women.\nOn each trial, participants were presented through headphones with two speaker\u2019s voices of\nthe same Fo condition (Low, Normal, High) and speaker\u2019s sex (males, females). Voices were played consecutively and separated by 800 ms of silence. After listening to the pair of voices, participants were asked to indicate which of the two voices belonged to the taller speaker by selecting the corresponding button on the screen. On each trial, participants could listen to the pair of voices again at will by clicking on a play button.\nPage 6 of 21\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pms\nPerceptual and Motor Skills\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review"

The overall percentages of successes of trials in which the taller speaker was correctly identified were the following for each Fo condition. For the \u2018Normal\u2019 condition (in which Fo was not modified), accuracy achieved 59.0%, 95% CI [55.5%, 62.6%], above chance level (50.0%; p < .0001). For the Low condition (Fo lowered - 0.5 ERBs), accuracy was 57.0% [53.5%, 60.5%], whereas for High condition (Fo raised + 0.5 ERBs) accuracy increased to 63.6% [60.5%, 66.6%]. Table 1 and Figure 1 shows the percentages separated by the sex of speakers. We can see the same trend for both sexes: accuracy increased for high-Fo sentences and roughly decreased for low-Fo sentences.\nWe carried out a 3 (Fo; Low, Normal, High) x 2 (Sex of Speakers) ANOVA. The analysis\nfound a significant Fo effect, F (2, 134) = 7.24, MSe = 214.12, p = .001, 2p = .0981, and also a significant effect of the Sex of Speaker factor, F (1, 67) = 9.54, MSe = 230.21, p = .003, 2p = .125, indicating that the female speakers received higher rates (62.2%, 95% CI [58.8%, 65.6%]) than the male speakers (57.5%, 95% CI [54.9%, 60.2%]). The Fo x Sex of Speaker interaction did not reach significance, F (2, 134) < 1. Posterior within-subject contrasts revealed that accuracy for the High Fo condition was significantly different (higher) from accuracy for the Normal condition, F (1, 67) = 14.01, MSe = 301.86, p < .0001, 2p = .173.\nOur data clearly suggested that by raising the fundamental frequency of the voice, listeners\nincreased their accuracy in judging the speakers\u2019 body size.

We used five Fo conditions: the natural\nspeech recordings (\u2018Normal\u2019 condition), the natural recordings with their Fo lowered - 0.5 ERB (\u2018- 0.5 ERB\u2019), the natural recordings with their Fo lowered - 1.0 ERB (\u2018- 1.0 ERB\u2019), the natural recordings with their Fo raised + 0.5 ERB (\u2018+ 0.5 ERB\u2019), and the natural recordings with their Fo raised + 1.0 ERB (\u2018+ 1.0 ERB\u2019). The manipulation of Fo was carried out with the same technical procedure used in experiment 1 (PSOLA algorithm of Praat software, Boersma & Weenink, 2016).\nPairing of speech stimuli. We created a total of 150 pairs of stimuli, 30 for each Fo\ncondition (- 1.0 ERB, - 0.5 ERB, Normal, + 0.5 ERB, + 1.0 ERB). Each pair was formed by two different stimuli belonging to the same Fo condition, separated by 800 ms of silence. Normal condition was formed by 30 different pairs of female speakers, whose heights differed in a range of 9 \u2013 19 cm (M = 13.9 cm, SD = 2.9 cm); half of the pairs included the taller woman in the first place, and half in the second place. The pairs were the same for the other four Fo conditions.\nProcedure The total of 150 pairs was divided into three sets of 50 pairs (10 per each Fo condition).\nEach participant was randomly assigned to one of the three sets of stimuli, resulting in a total of 50 size assessment trials per each participant. Participants individually performed the experiment in two short sessions of twenty-five trials in random order.\nOn each trial, participants were presented through headphones with two women\u2019s voices of\nthe same Fo condition. Voices were played consecutively and separated by 800 ms of silence. After listening to the pair of voices, participants were asked to indicate which of the two voices belonged to the taller woman by selecting the corresponding button on the screen. On each trial, participants could listen to the pair of voices again at will by clicking on a play button.\nPage 9 of 21\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pms\nPerceptual and Motor Skills\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review"

Pisanski et al. (2014a) found in their third experiment that lowering the voice pitch or fundamental frequency (Fo) of a vowel helped listeners improve their accuracy in estimating the body size of the utterers (specifically male speakers). The authors explained this effect by means of the Harmonic density hypothesis. More specifically, increasing the density of harmonics in the speech spectrum (a consequence of lowering the fundamental frequency, because harmonics are multiples of Fo) would allow for better resolution of formants, aiding formant-based body size perception.\nWe tested this hypothesis employing connected speech as stimuli instead of isolated vowels.\nIn the first experiment, we increased and decreased the Fo of a sentence pronounced by a set of male and female speakers. Unexpectedly, listeners perceived better the speaker\u2019s body size (height) when Fo was raised (not lowered), contradicting to the prediction made by the Harmonic density hypothesis. This effect was roughly corroborated in a second experiment based on a word spoken by female speakers, although the effect size was smaller. Apparently, this finding was counterintuitive and contrary to the prediction of the mentioned hypothesis.\nOne possible explanation could be in the temporal domain of stimuli rather than in the\nfrequency domain. Gonz\u00e1lez and Oliver (2004) compared size estimations from connected speech (sentences) versus sustained vowels and found that connected speech yielded more accurate judgments than vowels. Logically, connected speech comprises a much larger voice sample than isolated vowels. However, connected speech is more than the sum of different phonemes and constitutes a dynamic and coarticulated succession of consonants and vowels\nPage 11 of 21\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pms\nPerceptual and Motor Skills\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nforming syllables as units of articulation (particularly in Spanish). There may be other acoustic predictors of body size beyond the mean frequencies of Fo and the formants (F1-F4). Gonz\u00e1lez and Oliver (2004) found that actual height was the strongest predictor of perceptual judgments from a spoken sentence, in both male and female speakers. This was more to be expected in female voices, given the low correlation between the acoustic parameters studied (Fo, F1-F4) and height, but it was also evident in male voices, in which the partial correlation between actual height and judgments of \"taller\" in a binary discrimination task reached 0.51 after removing the influence of Fo and F1-F4. These authors concluded that \u201cpartial correlations and multiple regression analysis showed that listeners efficiently rely on other features present mainly in connected speech (sentences as opposed to a sustained vowel)\u201d (p. 29). They hypothesized that such features could be related to dynamic and time-varying acoustic properties of speech that could serve as sources of inferences about the biomechanical properties \u2013 mass, mobility and inertial characteristics \u2013 of the articulator apparatus and its possible relationship with body size. In this sense, the envelope of the acoustic wave of speech in the temporal domain could play a role in providing information on such dynamic and time-varying properties. In this case, an increase in the fundamental frequency would increase the sampling density of the wave acoustic cycles and provide more detailed information, such as higher resolution, on the envelope shape.\nIrino, Aoki, Kawahara, and Patterson (2012) studied the interaction between Fo (glottal\npulse rate, GPR) and mean-formant-frequency (MFF) with synthetized words in the perception of speaker characteristics and speech recognition. They observed that, within a certain range of MFF, increasing the Fo had the effect of improving the performance. The authors interpreted this result in the temporal domain of speech signal because as the glottal pulse rate (Fo) increases, the number of cycles per unit time also increases. They related this physical fact to the functioning\nPage 12 of 21\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pms\nPerceptual and Motor Skills\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nof the auditory system. \u201cIf the analysis performed by the auditory system is pitch synchronous and anchored to the glottal pulses as described in Irino and Patterson (2002), the internal representation will become much more stable as GPR increases from 0.25 to 4.0, and it seems reasonable to assume that speech features would be better defined in a more stable representation\u201d (Irino et al., 2012, p. 1009). Irino and Patterson (2002) considered that human listeners hear, for example, vowels spoken by men and women as approximately the same vowel although the length of the vocal tract varies considerably from group to group. Simultaneously, listeners can identify the speaker group. They suggested that the auditory system can extract and segregate information about the size of the vocal tract from information about its shape. In accordance with Irino and Patterson (2002), the auditory system performs a transform (Mellin transform) creating an auditory image, in which the information on the vocal tract size is represented apart from the information corresponding to its particular shape. According with Irino et al. (2012), this auditory image will become more stable and efficient when Fo increases within a certain range.\nNevertheless, further research will be necessary to confirm the present finding and test the\neffect that lowering versus raising the speaking fundamental frequency could have on perception of speaker\u2019s body size (and vocal tract length) using different speech materials beyond isolated vowels, and compare voices of male versus female speakers, along with children.\nPage 13 of 21\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pms\nPerceptual and Motor Skills\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nFootnotes\n1 The effect size interpretations for \u03b72p values are: .01 = small, .06 = medium, and .14 = large.\nEthical Compliance Section\nThis work was completed with resources provided by the University Jaume I (Spain).\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with\nthe Deontological commission and of the Ethical Committee of Animal Welfare of the University Jaume I (Spain) and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\nThe authors declare they have no conflict of interest.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all individual adult participants included in\nthe study.\nPage 14 of 21\nhttps://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/pms\nPerceptual and Motor Skills\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nReferences\nBoersma, P., & Weenink, D.
