1. **Investigate the relationship between EWP and other sustainability indicators.** This could include exploring how EWP is related to economic growth, social development, and environmental quality. This research could help to identify the factors that contribute to sustainable development and inform policies that promote EWP.


2. **Develop methods for measuring EWP at the individual or household level.** This would allow for a more fine-grained analysis of EWP and could help to identify the factors that contribute to individual well-being. This research could also inform policies that are designed to improve the well-being of individuals and households.


3. **Conduct longitudinal studies of EWP over time.** This would allow for a better understanding of the long-term trends in EWP and could help to identify the factors that are driving these trends. This research could also inform policies that are designed to promote sustainable development over the long term.


4. **Compare EWP across different countries or regions.** This could help to identify the factors that contribute to EWP in different contexts and could inform policies that are designed to promote EWP in countries or regions that are lagging behind.


5. **Develop tools and resources to help policymakers and practitioners implement EWP-related policies and programs.** This could include developing guidelines, toolkits, and training materials. This research could help to ensure that EWP-related policies and programs are implemented effectively and efficiently.
