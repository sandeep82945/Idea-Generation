    "abstractText": "The concentration of rare earth elements (REEs) in geological materials including SLRS-6 (natural water certified reference material) and JB1b, JA1, and JG2 (Standard Rock Materials of Geological Survey of Japan) can be used as a tracer to characterize various geochemical processes in earth systems. Particularly, accurate and precise determination of rare earth element concentration in natural waters is difficult due to their extremely low concentration and the interference of polyatomic oxides. In this study, we developed a method for accurate and precise determination of the REE (particularly heavy rare earth elements) concentrations in geological materials including natural waters using a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) and group separation by 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (HIBA). The REEs were separated into light rare earth elements (LREEs, La\u2013Ce\u2013Pr\u2013Nd), middle rare earth elements (MREEs, Sm\u2013Eu\u2013Gd\u2013Tb), and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs, Dy\u2013Ho\u2013Er\u2013Tm\u2013Yb\u2013Lu) by a cation-exchange column (AG50W-X8 200\u2013400 mesh) using HIBA. The recovery rates of each REE in the natural water sample exceeded 98%, whereas the recovery rates of each REE in rock materials exceeded 95% except for HREEs. The method developed in this study can accurately measure the REE concentrations (particularly HREE) in geological materials without polyatomic oxide interference during the REE analysis by using the MC-ICP-MS and, thus, can correctly interpret the geochemical implications of REEs in geological systems. The determination of the Sr concentrations and Sr isotopic ratios of SLRS-6 CRM and JB1b, JA1, and JG2 SRMs is also reported, and they are shown to be in good agreement with the recommended values.",

Particularly, accurate and precise determination of rare earth element concentration in natural waters is difficult due to their extremely low concentration and the interference of polyatomic oxides. In this study, we developed a method for accurate and precise determination of the REE (particularly heavy rare earth elements) concentrations in geological materials including natural waters using a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) and group separation by 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (HIBA). The REEs were separated into light rare earth elements (LREEs, La\u2013Ce\u2013Pr\u2013Nd), middle rare earth elements (MREEs, Sm\u2013Eu\u2013Gd\u2013Tb), and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs, Dy\u2013Ho\u2013Er\u2013Tm\u2013Yb\u2013Lu) by a cation-exchange column (AG50W-X8 200\u2013400 mesh) using HIBA. The recovery rates of each REE in the natural water sample exceeded 98%, whereas the recovery rates of each REE in rock materials exceeded 95% except for HREEs. The method developed in this study can accurately measure the REE concentrations (particularly HREE) in geological materials without polyatomic oxide interference during the REE analysis by using the MC-ICP-MS and, thus, can correctly interpret the geochemical implications of REEs in geological systems. The determination of the Sr concentrations and Sr isotopic ratios of SLRS-6 CRM and JB1b, JA1, and JG2 SRMs is also reported, and they are shown to be in good agreement with the recommended values.\nKEYWORDS\nrare earth element, group separation, HIBA, MC-ICP-MS, geological materials\n1 Introduction\nThe rare earth elements (REEs) consist of 14 lanthanide elements (except Pm which has no natural isotope) ranging from La to Lu and have similar chemical and physical properties, with a gradual change in the ionic radius (the so-called lanthanide contraction). Such uniformity arises because of the similar configuration of the valence electrons in all the REEs and becomes a cause for an ordered distribution in various geological processes. Particularly, the REEs tend to exist in any natural occurrence as a group rather than as a single element or as a combination of a few of"

They also have unique geochemical features during various geological processes such as chemical weathering and sedimentation. Therefore, the REE concentrations and their variation in natural waters can be used as a tracer to characterize various geochemical processes of water systems (Elderfield and Greaves, 1982; Dia et al., 2000; Lawrence et al., 2006; Lawrence and Kamber, 2006; Wu et al., 2007; Noack et al., 2014; Pignotti et al., 2017). However, the REE concentrations in natural waters are usually very low (generally, pg/mL level). Thus, accurate, precise, and reliable methods for their determination are a prerequisite for interpreting the geochemical implications in environmental media such as river water, groundwater, and sea water. For example, Yeghicheyan et al. (2019) and Babechuk et al. (2020) reported compiled data for REE concentrations of SLRS-6 (natural river water certified reference material of NRC-CNRS). In the PAAS (Post-Archean Australian Shale)-normalized REE pattern, the shape of the HREE pattern shows some differences between these elements. In particular, the HREE pattern presented by Babechuk et al. (2020) indicated the possibility of a specific pattern called the REE tetrad effect (Peppard et al., 1969; Masuda and Ikeuchi, 1979; Masuda et al., 1987; Kawabe et al., 1998; Anenburg and Williams, 2022). However, the HREE pattern presented by Yeghicheyan et al. (2019) shows a zigzag shape rather than the REE tetrad effect. Such a difference can lead to different geochemical interpretations.\nInductively coupled plasma quadruple mass spectrometry (ICPQMS) is the most popular and effective instrumental technique for the determination of the REE concentrations in geological, environmental, and meteoritic materials (Lawrence et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2010; 2021; Tepe and Bau, 2015; Fischer and Kara, 2016; Pignotti et al., 2017; Tanaka et al., 2018; Babechuk et al., 2020; Wysocka, 2021). Recently, Babechuk et al. (2020) reported a method for the precise and accurate determination of the REE concentrations in natural river water using ICP-QMS. The authors mentioned that the Eu concentration showed a large discrepancy compared to most of the REEs due to the BaO+ interference. In fact, the Ba oxides can be problematic for the accurate and precise measurement of 151Eu+ and 153Eu+ due to 135Ba16O+ and 137Ba16O+ interference, respectively. Kim et al. (2019) experimentally showed that the Eu concentration increases with an increase in the Ba/Eu concentration ratio despite oxide correction during measurements of the REEs using the ICP-QMS technique. For example, the sample solution with a Ba concentration 100 times higher than the Eu concentration showed a measured value of the Eu concentration of 10% or higher than the recommended value. Since most natural waters have a Ba content 100 times higher than that of Eu, it may be necessary to remove Ba in order to determine the accurate and precise Eu concentration in natural river water because the concentration of Ba affects that of Eu in chondrite- or PAAS (PostArchean Australian Shale)-normalized REE patterns.\nThe MC-ICP-MS also allows the measurement of multiple isotopes using techniques such as isotope dilution and standard sample bracketing to achieve more precise and accurate elemental concentrations (Baker et al., 2002; Kent et al., 2004; Pourmand et al., 2012). Compared to ICP-QMS, which has the disadvantage of being expensive, the MC-ICP-MS minimizes the influence of fluctuations inherent in the plasma source. However, for accurate and precise measurement of the REE concentration by using the MC-ICP-MS, the following conditions are required: 1) low procedural total blanks; 2) removal of the interfering matrix; and 3) elimination of molecular\noxides and hydrides which result in direct interferences with the masses of the analytes. The determination of the REE concentration using ICP-MS can be distorted by spectral interferences that include the oxides of the lighter REEs on some of the heavier REEs such as 140Ce16O+ on 156Gd+, 141Pr16O+ on 157Gd+, and 159Tb16O+ on 175Lu+. In addition, the Ba oxides can also be problematic for the accurate and precise measurement of 151Eu+ and 153Eu+ due to 135Ba16O+ and 137Ba16O+ interference, respectively. Therefore, a preconcentration and a matrix separation step of the REEs is necessary for MC-ICPMS analysis. The oxide interferences during measurement of the REEs by the MC-ICP-MS in this study are summarized in Table 1.\nIn this article, we present the development of amodifiedmethod of MC-ICP-MS using group separation of the REEs by HIBA (2- hydroxyisobutric acid) to determine more accurately and precisely the concentration of the REEs in geological materials including natural waters. The analytical procedures, including their precision, accuracy, method blank, and the limits of quantification, are discussed. The REE concentration of the natural river water certified reference material (SLRS-6, NRC-CNRS) has been measured and compared with highprecision data measured by various ICP-MS techniques from the literature to examine the accuracy of our protocol. We also measured the REE concentrations of Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) such as JB1a, JA1, and JG2 produced by the Geological Survey of Japan (GSJ) for confirming the usefulness of the method developed in this study. When measuring the REE concentrations by using the MCICP-MS, our method almost completely eliminates the effect of polyatomic oxide interference, leading to a clearer understanding of the geochemical implications of HREEs in natural water."

After the addition of 0.1\u20130.2 mL of concentrated HClO4, the dissolved sample solution was heated to dryness at ca. 180\u00b0C for more than 1 day. The cakes were re-dissolved in a mixture of 1 mL concentrated HCl and 0.5 mL concentrated HNO3 and then dried at ca. 160\u00b0C for 1 day. Sample residues were re-dissolved in 5\u201310 ml 6 M HCl stock solution. Of this, 0.5\u20132 ml was used to determine REE concentrations using the conventional inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method or column chromatography for REE preconcentration. The aliquots were dried and re-dissolved in 4 mL of 2 M HCl for HCl column chromatography.\nFor the natural water sample, although this method is not generally suitable because it frequently leads to precipitation of salts and is time-consuming and labor-intensive, we selected the simple method of evaporation for preconcentration and group separation of the REEs in water samples. Aliquots (50 mL) of SLRS-6 CRM water were placed in five pre-cleaned PTFE beakers\nfor preconcentration, and then, the weight was measured. The water samples in the PTFE beakers were placed on a hot plate and evaporated slowly at 80\u00b0C. In order to prevent precipitation of salt, we stopped drying the water samples when less than 0.5 mL of the original aliquot remained in the PTFE beaker. Then, prior to sample loading for HCl column chromatography, 2 mL of 2N HCl was added to each PTFE beaker.\nTanaka et al. (2018) developed a group separation method for REE determination in GSJ/AIST geochemical references JCp-1 (coral) and JCt-1 (giant clam) using isotope dilution ICP-QMS (quadrupole mass spectrometry). The authors separated the REE fraction from major elements using Biorad AG50W X-8 resin (200\u2013400 mesh) and HCl. The authors then divided the REEs into LREE (La, Ce, Pr, and Nd), MREE (Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, and Dy), and HREE (Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) fractions using a quartz glass column (\u00f8 3 mm, length 98 mm) containing 0.8 mL of the cation-exchange resin (Biorad AG 50WX8, 200\u2013400 mesh) and 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (HIBA) as the eluant. However, in the MREE by Tanaka et al. (2018), Dy (161Dy+) was masked by Sm oxides (144Sm17O+) (Table 1).\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org03\nLee and Ko 10.3389/fchem.2022.906160\nEach separated REE group was clear and had no tailing of the neighboring fractions during measurement by using the MC-ICP-MS. Two-step cation-exchange column chromatographic processes using Biorad AG50W X-8 resin (200\u2013400 mesh) and diluted HCl and HIBA solutions are summarized in Table 2. A 2 M stock solution of HIBA was adjusted to pH 4.6 using ultrapure NH4OH (Merck). Nuryono et al. (1998) showed that the elution time and resolution during HIBA column chromatography depended on the pH of HIBA. Therefore, the authors recommended that pH 4.6 is optimal for REE separation by HIBA column chromatography because at pH < 4.6, the eluent is too weak to elute REE ions and at pH > 4.6, the resolution is too low to guarantee adequate REE separation.\nBefore dividing the REEs into three groups, the range for separating each of 14 REEs consisting of La to Lu was first determined (Figure 1). Based on the data of Figure 1, we modified the REE fractions as follows: LREE (La, Ce, Pr, and Nd), MREE (Sm, Eu, Gd, and Tb), and HREE (Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) (Table 2). In addition, by controlling the HIBA concentration as shown in Figure 1, it becomes possible to separate each of the 14 REEs with ultra-high purity for isotope ratio determination (Lee and Tanaka, 2019; Lee and Tanaka, 2021).\nThe HIBA contained in the eluted group REE fraction was dried at 140\u00b0C using a hot plate and decomposed with 2% HNO3 for MC-ICPMS analysis."

Nine Faraday collectors were used for measuring REE concentrations using the standard sample bracketing technique. All of the Faraday collectors are connected to amplifiers with 1011 \u03a9 amplifier channels.\nIn the natural water sample, the measurements were performed in low-resolution mode with Ni Jet-sampling and Ni X-skimmer cones. The samples were introduced into the MC-ICP-MS through a Cetac ARIDUS II\u2122 desolvation systemwith ultrapure Ar and N2 gases used as carrier and sweep gasses to improve the elemental sensitivity. In SRM samples, the measurements were performed in low-resolution mode with the Ni X-sampling and Ni X-skimmer cones in the static mode.\nThe gain on each Faraday cup was monitored daily to ensure normalization of its efficiency.

As can be seen in the figure, the elution range for each group (LREE, MREE and HREE) in this study was separately indicated by the concentration and amount of HIBA. In addition, as evident in the MREE part, it is possible to separate each of the 14 REEs with ultra-high purity for isotope ratio determination.\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org05\nLee and Ko 10.3389/fchem.2022.906160\ncomparison with the PerkinElmer STD, we also prepared additional standard solutions for LREE, MREE, and HREE from single-element solution of the 14 REEs that contained 100 \u03bcg/g of AccuStandard. The concentrations of each REE group (LREE, MREE, and HREE) were certified by a diluted solution of PerkinElmer Multi-Elements Standard (No. N9300232). The linearity of the calibration curve of the beam intensity, according to the concentration change from the home-made PerkinElmer STD and the Accu STD, showed a correlation coefficient value of one on the same line, which indicates that the beam intensity of each REE isotope increases constantly according to the change in the concentration of each REE (Supplementary Figure S1).\nThe standard sample bracketing method in the MC-ICP-MS is usually used for the determination of isotope ratio variation.

The background equivalent concentration (BEC), as the full instrument background for REEs, was less than 0.2 pg/L (D in Table 4). The total procedural blanks during HCl and HIBA column chromatography in this study are presented with the total acid blank in Table 4.\nThe blank intensity of each REE isotope in the resin before sample loading was less than 0.0002 V. The blank intensity of each REE isotope in the total amounts of HCl and HIBA solutions used for column chromatography was less than 0.0006 V and 0.00005 V, respectively. Therefore, most of the REE concentration in the acids used during column chromatography was less than 5 pg/L. Blank corrections were performed for each REE group by subtracting the total procedural blank from each REE measurement.\nThe Ba concentrations in natural water are generally three orders of magnitude higher than that of Eu, which can generate spectral interferences that cannot be ignored. The oxides that were formed from the LREE andMREE fractions during themeasurement using the MC-ICP-MS and the Aridus II desolvating nebulizer system in this study are shown in Figure 2. With the exception of 139La16O+, which is an isobar of 155Gd+, most oxides from LREE andMREE were formed in less than 0.02% of the primary peak. Therefore, Figure 2 indicates clearly that REE determination by using the MC-ICP-MS and the Aridus II desolvating nebulizer system also may need a correction related to the presence of oxides and hydroxides for measuring REE analysis using theMC-ICP-MS without group separation. However, in this study, we confirmed that the signal of Ba in theMREE fraction was not detected and most of the LREE fraction included a trace of Ba. We, therefore, could neglect Ba oxide interferences and did not need mathematical correction for the results of MREE, including Eu, in the present work."

(2019) reported a valuable compilation of the uncertified REE concentrations in SLRS-6 based on analysis by nine different laboratories. In addition, Babechuk et al. (2020) reported an improved dataset for REE concentrations in SLRS-6. In this article, we used these compiled data for comparison with our determined REE data. The analytical results for REEs in SLRS-6 obtained in the present work are summarized in Table 5 along with a set of compiled data (the values reported) in the references.\nTable 5 indicates that the observed values for Sm, Dy, Ho, and Yb in the SLRS-6 water sample agreed with the data reported by Yeghicheyan et al. (2019) and Babechuk et al. (2020). Particularly, concentrations of Sm, Eu, Dy, Ho, Yb, and Lu agreed with the data from Babechuk et al. (2020). However, our LREE data appear to be higher than those reported by Babechuk et al. (2020) and Yeghicheyan et al. (2019).\nComparative REE data (Table 5; Figure 3) enabled us to comment on the accuracy of our method, which depends on accurate preconcentration and perfect recovery of the REE fraction during column chromatography. The concentrations of Eu, Dy, and Lu in this study were slightly lower than the compiled values presented by Yeghicheyan et al. (2019), whereas those of the other REEs show a higher value. However, when our data were compared with those of Babechuk et al. (2020), the concentrations of Sm, Eu, Dy, Ho, Yb, and Lu were similar and the others were slightly higher. The recovery values for REEs obtained in this study were all quite close to 100%, with standard deviations under 2% (Table 5). These results support the conclusion that the present results for REEs in SLRS-6 are also accurate.\nThe concentrations of REEs in SLRS-6 in this study cover a range from approximately 300 pg/mL of La, Ce, and Nd to approximately 2 pg/mL of Tm and Lu. The concentration data of each REE group obtained by our technique were reproduced to ~ 5% accuracy. The reproducibility of the REE concentration can be further improved by enhanced column chromatography and cup configuration.\nFIGURE 2 (A) Peak intensity (V) of LREE metal isotopes and their oxides in 10 ppb LREE solutions (B) Peak intensity (V) of MREE metal isotopes and their oxides in 10 ppb MREE solutions (see Table 1).

The normalized REE pattern, which is directly related to the fractionation or differentiation history of the source material, has an important role in interpretation of the behavior of REEs in geochemical and environmental systems. The rare earth elements display unique properties in which the ionic radius decreases regularly as the atomic number increases and these elements also have similar physical/chemical properties. Therefore, the REE concentrations of geologicalmaterials can be evaluatedwith a pattern normalized to those of a primitive chondrite or an upper continental crust composite such as PAAS (Post-Archean Australian Shale).

Recently, Babechuk et al. (2020) used the alluvial sediment composite \u201cMud from Queensland\u201d (MuQ) (Kamber et al., 2005) for REE normalization in river water. The concentration of REEs in environmental materials including natural water is produced by the water\u2013sediment reaction rather than the water\u2013rock interaction in the crust. This means that MuQ from Kamber et al. (2005) is more appropriate than PAAS as a normalizing criterion for interpreting normalized REE plots in natural waters. Lawrence and Kamber (2006) and Babechuk et al. (2020) applied the \u201csmoothness\u201d of the non-anomalous (or potentially non-anomalous) elements in the normalized pattern (i.e., excluding La, Ce, Eu, Gd, Y, and Lu) to attest to the quality of the data and the accuracy of interelement REE ratios.\nTherefore, in this study, we also used the value of MuQ as a normalizing criterion for interpreting normalized REE plots in SLRS6. MuQ-normalized REE patterns of SLRS-6 data from this study are shown in Figure 3A. The REE pattern (solid red symbols) was plotted based on the average values of REEs of SLRS-6 obtained during this study. Figure 3B compares the MuQ-normalized REE patterns of SLRS-6 data from the study of Babechuk et al. (2020) and Yeghicheyan\net al. (2019). Except for Nd, our data overlap with the data of Babechuk et al. (2020). However, Nd deviated slightly from LREE and showed a relatively higher value. Further experiments are needed to clarify the cause of Nd enrichment.\nFigure 3C depicts MuQ-normalized REE patterns of KIGAM groundwaters pumped from a borehole. The REE contents were measured by ID-TIMS (isotope dilution thermal ion mass spectrometry) using a JEOL JMS-05RB thermal ion mass spectrometer (Lee et al., 2004). ID-TIMS is the best method to accurately and precisely measure the concentration of REEs in geological materials, but it cannot measure the concentration of mono-isotope elements such as Pr, Tb, Ho, and Tm. Therefore, we could not compose a complete REE pattern, as shown in Figures 3A, B. Nevertheless, we can deduce a smooth curve of the W-type REE tetrad effect. Moreover, the HREE pattern in Figure 3C shows the REE tetrad effect of W-type (Masuda et al., 1987). Particularly, the smooth HREE pattern of SLRS-6 in this study suggests that it clearly exhibits the \u2018smoothness\u2019 typical of non-anomalous elements in the normalized pattern (i.e., W-type of the REE tetrad effect), thereby confirming that the HREE concentration in natural water has a\nFIGURE 5 C1 chondrite-normalized REE patterns of JA1: (A) measured by conventional ICP-MS method without HCl column chromatography in this study and (B) measured by conventional ICP-MS method after HCl column chromatography in this study.

The recovery rate and accuracy of REE concentrations from SLRS-6 CRM and JB1b, JA1, and JG2 SRMs in this study indicate good agreement with the REE concentration in SLRS-6, JB1b, JG2, and JA1 from the literature. The recovery rate and accuracy of REE concentrations from SRMs for rock materials in this study also indicate good agreement with the REE concentration by ICP-MS data from the literature, except for HREEs. Our results indicate that the accuracy and precision of our method can help to interpret the behavior of REEs in natural water systems as well as rock materials. In particular, it will become one of the main concentration measurement methods for REEs that can lead to a clearer understanding of the unique geochemical behavior of REEs, namely, the REE tetrad effect. In addition, accurate and precise determination of Sr concentration and isotope ratio in natural water and SRMs for rock samples was obtained as a by-product during these investigations."
