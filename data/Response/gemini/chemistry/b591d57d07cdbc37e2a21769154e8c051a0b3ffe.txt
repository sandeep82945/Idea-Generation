1. **Investigate the relationship between the chemical composition and biological activities of propolis extracts:** 
This could be done by analyzing the correlation between the levels of specific compounds (e.g., flavonoids, phenolic acids, terpenes) and the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts. This information could be used to identify the compounds responsible for the biological activities of propolis and to develop standardized extracts with consistent bioactivities.


2. **Evaluate the effects of propolis extracts on specific diseases or conditions:** 
This could be done by conducting in vivo studies using animal models of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, or neurodegenerative disorders. These studies could investigate the efficacy of propolis extracts in preventing or treating these diseases and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action.


3. **Explore the potential of propolis extracts as food additives or nutraceuticals:** 
This could be done by evaluating the safety and efficacy of propolis extracts in human clinical trials. These studies could investigate the effects of propolis extracts on various health parameters, such as antioxidant status, immune function, and cardiovascular health.


4. **Investigate the potential of propolis extracts to enhance the efficacy of antibiotics or other antimicrobial agents:** 
This could be done by conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the synergistic effects of propolis extracts with antibiotics or other antimicrobial agents against resistant bacteria or fungi. This research could lead to the development of new antimicrobial combinations that are more effective and less prone to resistance.


5. **Explore the potential of propolis extracts to inhibit the growth of cancer cells:** 
This could be done by conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the effects of propolis extracts on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. This research could lead to the development of new cancer therapies that are more effective and less toxic than traditional chemotherapy drugs.
