Radioactive contamination remediation using microorganisms has been the focus of numerous studies. We\u00a0 investigated the mechanism underlying Cs+ resistance in Microbacterium sp. TS-1 and other representative microorganisms, including Bacillus subtilis. The addition of Mg2+ effectively improved the Cs+ resistance of these microorganisms. When exposed to high concentrations of Cs+, the ribosomes of Cs+-sensitive mutants of TS-1 collapsed. Growth inhibition of B. subtilis in a high-concentration Cs+ environment was because of a drastic decrease in the intracellular potassium ion concentration and not the destabilization of the ribosomal complex. This is the first study demonstrating that the toxic effect of Cs+ on bacterial cells differs based on the presence of a Cs+ efflux mechanism. These results will aid in utilizing high-concentration Cs+resistant microorganisms for radioactive contamination remediation in the future.\nKEYWORDS\ncesium-resistant microorganism, magnesium, Microbacterium, Bacillus subtilis, ribosome\n1. Introduction\nAfter the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident in 2011, a large amount of radioactive cesium (Cs), 134Cs and 137Cs, was released into the environment, resulting in serious impacts on human health and the environment (Hirose, 2016; Nakamura et\u00a0al., 2022; Wu et\u00a0al., 2022). Since then, studies on contamination of the soil with radioactive Cs ions (Cs+), decontamination and bioremediation efforts, and the quest to identify Cs+-tolerant microorganisms have been prominent. Imparting radio resistance to Cs+-resistant microorganisms would lead to the creation of highly functional radiation-tolerant bacteria, which could efficiently recover radioactive Cs from radioactive Cs-contaminated environments. Therefore, creating highly functional microorganisms to be\u00a0used for bioremediation in environments contaminated with radioactive Cs is desirable.\nCs, an alkali metal, generally exists as a monovalent cation in solutions. Radioactive isotopes of Cs are water-soluble and can be\u00a0taken up by the ion uptake system of living organisms. The isotopes 134Cs and 137Cs have long half-lives (134Cs, 2.0652 years; 137Cs, 30.1 years), are discharged into the external environment during nuclear power generation and emit \u03b3- and \u03b2-rays when"

In addition, as Cs+ possess physicochemical properties similar to those of potassium ions (K+), Cs+ is transported into the cells through the K+ transport system (Perkins and Gadd, 1995). Since Escherichia coli does not have a Cs+ efflux system, Cs+ accumulates inside its cell. K+ is excreted from the cell by the K+ efflux system instead of Cs+. As a result, intracellular K+ concentration is significantly reduced (Jung et\u00a0 al., 2001). In addition, K+ contributes to the stabilization of ribosomes, and its deficiency results in growth inhibition (Avery, 1995; Hampton et\u00a0al., 2004).\nMicrobacterium sp. TS-1 (TS-1), an alkaliphilic bacterium, was isolated from a jumping spider (Salticidae) in our laboratory (Fujinami et\u00a0al., 2013). It is a gram-positive aerobic bacterium with an optimum pH range of 8.0\u20139.0. In addition, it is a highconcentration Cs+-resistant bacterium that can grow in media containing 1,200 mM CsCl (Koretsune et\u00a0al., 2022). Two significant mechanisms of Cs+ resistance in TS-1 have been reported (Koretsune et\u00a0al., 2022; Ishida et\u00a0al., 2023). The first mechanism works through the Cs+/H+ antiporter CshA, which excretes Cs+ from the cell and maintains a low intracellular Cs+ concentration. The Cs+-sensitive mutant strain Mut4 is a CshA defective mutant isolated previously (Koretsune et\u00a0al., 2022). The second mechanism involves maintaining Cs+ resistance through the uptake of magnesium ions (Mg2+) into cells via the magnesium transporter MgtE, even when the Cs+ concentration increases (Ishida et\u00a0al., 2023). A mutation in the mgtE gene of TS-1 (mutant strain Mut5) leads to Cs+-sensitivity because of the deficiency of intracellular Mg2+ (Ishida et\u00a0al., 2023), suggesting that Mg2+ plays an essential role in Cs+ resistance in TS-1. Magnesium is a group\u00a02 element and an essential trace element for organisms (Fiorentini et\u00a0al., 2021). It plays various roles, such as maintaining the structure of ribosomes and enzymatic activity (Akanuma et\u00a0al., 2014; Pontes et\u00a0al., 2016). If the Mg2+ transporter MgtE contributes toward improving Cs+ resistance in TS-1, it would be\u00a0interesting to investigate whether Mg2+ uptake into cells also leads to the enhancement of Cs+ tolerance in other microorganisms. These strains have multiple Mg2+ transporters but no Cs+/H+ antiporter CshA homologous proteins.\nTherefore, to verify whether Mg2+ plays an essential role in Cs+ resistance in microorganisms, we\u00a0used the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis BR151MA (wild-type), Staphylococcus aureus IAM12544, gram-negative E. coli W3110, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NBRC13275 as representative microorganisms. In addition, the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae JCM1499 was used for Cs+-resistant growth testing with MgCl2 added to the medium.\nFunctional analysis of TS-1 showed that in an environment with a Cs+ concentration of \u2264200 mM, Cs+ resistance was maintained by increasing the Mg2+ concentration in cells. Conversely, in a high Cs+ outer environment of >200 mM, Cs+ resistance was maintained with a low Cs+ concentration in cells through CshA. However, the exact mechanism by which the increase in cell Mg2+ concentration affects Cs+ resistance of TS-1 and the underlying physiological functions of CshA maintaining intracellular Cs+ concentration remain unknown.\nMg2+ stabilizes ribosomal complexes (Hsiao et\u00a0al., 2009; Nierhaus, 2014; Akanuma et\u00a0al., 2018). In B. subtilis, intracellular Mg2+ is stored in ribosomes and contributes to the stabilization of complex ribosomal formation (Akanuma et\u00a0 al., 2014, 2018). The intracellular accumulation of Cs+ in E. coli reduces intracellular K+ concentrations and inhibits growth (Bossemeyer et\u00a0al., 1989; Avery, 1995). Based on\nthese findings, in this study, we\u00a0considered the intracellular actions of the Cs+ resistance mechanism in TS-1 and hypothesized that in an environment with a Cs+ concentration < 200 mM, ribosomes are destabilized when Cs+ is taken up into the cells. As Mg2+ stabilizes the ribosomal complex, Cs+ resistance is acquired by enhancing the Mg2+ uptake by MgtE. In a Cs+ environment >200 mM, Cs+ resistance is achieved by excreting intracellular Cs+ through CshA to prevent intracellular accumulation of Cs+ and decrease intracellular K+ concentration.\nTherefore, we\u00a0 analyzed the ribosomal complex to verify the hypothesis regarding the acquisition of Cs+ resistance by incorporating Mg2+ into TS-1. To investigate the role of Mg2+ in Cs+ resistance, we\u00a0attempted to measure changes in Cs+, K+, and Mg2+ concentrations in the cells. Through these experiments, we\u00a0attempted to elucidate the effects of Cs+ concentration on TS-1 and also on B. subtilis, in which the relationship between ribosomes and Mg2+ has been well studied (Akanuma et\u00a0al., 2014; Nierhaus, 2014; Akanuma et\u00a0al., 2018; Lee et\u00a0al., 2019; Akanuma, 2021)."

Effect of treatment with and without Mg2+ addition on the growth of representative microorganisms showing Cs+ resistance\nExamining the effect of Mg2+ addition on Cs+ resistance in B. subtilis, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus, and S. cerevisiae as representative microorganisms showed that Cs+ resistance was improved by adding Mg2+ to the medium for all the five strains tested in this study. Furthermore, it was effective not only for TS-1 but also for microorganisms in general.\nMg2+ plays various essential roles in many organisms, including maintaining ribosome structure, genome stabilization, and enzyme activation (Akanuma et\u00a0al., 2018). It has been reported that increasing the intracellular Mg2+ concentration stabilizes ribosomes in B. subtilis, in which the structure of the ribosome is destabilized due to the deletion of a part of the ribosomal protein (Akanuma et\u00a0al., 2018). Therefore, we\u00a0hypothesized that Mg2+ enhanced Cs+ tolerance. Cs+ uptake by cells affected ribosome complex formation. As Mg2+ stabilized the structure of ribosomes, the upper limit of Cs+ concentrations tolerated by the strain was considered to be\u00a0improved.\nDifferences were found in the improvement in Cs+ tolerance and the amount of Mg2+ required for the outcome obtained by adding Mg2+ to each microbial species culture. It was speculated that the increase in intracellular Mg2+ could counteract the drastic decrease in intracellular K+ concentration to some extent or that the stability of ribosomes might differ among microorganisms or both."

            "text": "revertants, and B. subtilis with and without CsCl treatment\nChanges in intracellular Cs+, K+, and Mg2+ concentrations in strains TS-1 and B. subtilis with and without CsCl treatment were measured.\nIn B. subtilis, intracellular Cs+ concentration increased with increasing CsCl concentration in the medium, and the K+ concentration decreased sharply. From the Cs+-tolerant growth test results, the intracellular K+ concentration decreased to approximately 13% of that in the absence of Cs+ at 200 mM CsCl, at which B. subtilis could not grow. It was speculated that the extreme decrease in\nintracellular K+ concentration in B. subtilis impeded the maintenance of vital functions. This was consistent with results reported for E. coli (Avery, 1995). B. subtilis and E. coli do not harbor a Cs+ efflux mechanism. Thus, it was inferred that a decrease in intracellular K+ concentration was the leading cause of growth inhibition in these bacteria. CsCl treatment slightly increased intracellular Mg2+ but did not make a significant difference. Contrastingly, in strain TS-1, the intracellular Cs+ concentration remained lower than that in B. subtilis even when the CsCl concentration increased, and the concentration was maintained at approximately <200 mM. Intracellular K+ concentration was moderately decreased in TS-1 following Cs+ treatment compared to that in B. subtilis, and intracellular K+ concentration was high compared to that in B. subtilis. This may be\u00a0because TS-1 harbors a Cs+ efflux system, CshA (Koretsune et\u00a0al., 2022). The apparent Km value of CshA at pH 8.0 was approximately 250 mM, indicating that TS-1 prevented the intracellular Cs+ concentration from increasing and K+ deficiency.\nAnalysis of the changes in intracellular Cs+, K+, and Mg2+ concentrations with and without Cs+ treatment in the TS-1 Cs+sensitive mutants and its revertants revealed that CsCl treatment of Mut4 resulted in an influx of Cs+ into cells, and the K+ concentration was significantly reduced. This was similar to the results obtained for B. subtilis, which does not possess a Cs+ efflux system. This suggested that Cs+ excretion by CshA was essential for Cs+ resistance in TS-1 cells. In addition, the intracellular Mg2+ concentration in Mut4 was maintained at higher levels than those in the wild-type strain. This suggested that Mg2+ was incorporated into cells to resist the toxicity caused by the influx of a large amount of Cs+ into the cells. Since CshA in the Cs+ efflux system is active in Mut5, which is a MgtE mutant, Cs+ and K+ concentrations were similar to those of the wild-type even after Cs+ treatment. No significant difference was observed in the intracellular Mg2+ concentration. This suggested the possibility that another Mg2+ transporter performed the uptake of Mg2+ into the cell and functioned when Cs+ entered the cells of Mut5.\nMg2+ has been shown to improve Cs+ resistance in several microorganisms. We\u00a0investigated changes in intracellular Cs+, K+, and Mg2+ concentrations when MgCl2 was added simultaneously with CsCl in B. subtilis. The addition of 50 mM of MgCl2 decreased the intracellular Cs+ concentration at a CsCl concentration of 400 mM. The E. coli Cs+ uptake system, Kup, becomes less active when the cell is filled with K+ (Dosch et\u00a0al., 1991). Although the details of the Cs+ uptake system of B. subtilis have not been elucidated, the K+ uptake system is expected to take up Cs+. A significant increase in the intracellular K+ concentration was observed when Mg2+ was added at a CsCl concentration of 200 mM (p = 0.03). Although there was no significant difference in this experiment, the intracellular K+ concentration increased at CsCl concentrations of 300 and 400 mM at a level close to the CsCl concentration of 200 mM (300 mM: p = 0.06, 400 mM: p = 0.08). This was presumed to be\u00a0because the addition of high concentrations of CsCl and MgCl2 enhanced the uptake of K+ to adapt to the high osmotic pressure environment."

In addition, we\u00a0investigated whether the ribosomal complex was affected when Mg2+ was added to B. subtilis cultures to improve Cs+ tolerance. We\u00a0observed that Cs+ treatment did not affect the ribosomal complex in the TS-1 wild-type. However, in the Cs+-sensitive strains Mut4 and Mut5, the 70S ribosomes collapsed following CsCl treatment. However, CsCl treatment did not affect the ribosomal complex of B. subtilis.\nMut4 is a CshA mutant, and a large amount of Cs+ accumulated in the cells based on the measurement results of intracellular Cs+ concentration. Therefore, it is suggested that high concentrations of intracellular Cs+ destabilize ribosomes. Strain Mut5 is an MgtE mutant, and although it has no issue with Mg2+ uptake, it is presumed that Mg2+ uptake cannot be\u00a0 enhanced when Mg2+ is required. Therefore, it was speculated that ribosomes destabilized by Cs+ could be\u00a0stabilized owing to the lack of Mg2+. High concentrations of K+ inhibit ribosome complex formation by competing with Mg2+ (Nierhaus, 2014; Senbayram et\u00a0 al., 2015). Because Cs+ has physicochemical properties similar to those of K+, it was speculated that Cs+ destabilized ribosomes by competing with Mg2+.\nTS-1 wild-type suppressed intracellular Cs+ to \u2264200 mM in a high-concentration Cs+ environment by excreting intracellular Cs+ using CshA. In a Cs+ environment of \u2264200 mM, MgtE is considered to enhance Mg2+ uptake and stabilize the ribosomal complex, thereby adapting to the Cs+ environment.\nBacillus subtilis did not exhibit Cs+ resistance, and when treated with CsCl, Cs+ accumulated in the cells, similar to Mut4. Thus, the ribosome complex is expected to be\u00a0 similarly destroyed by CsCl treatment. However, CsCl treatment did not have a significant effect on ribosomal complexes. The impact of improving Cs+ tolerance by adding Mg2+ differed depending on the microbial species. Hence, the stability of ribosomes to Cs+ was expected to vary depending on the microbial species. Certain ribosomal proteins function to replace Mg2+ for ribosomal stabilization (Hsiao et\u00a0al., 2009; Akanuma et\u00a0al., 2014). Although Cs+ competes with Mg2+ to destabilize ribosomes, it does not affect ribosome stabilization by ribosomal proteins, suggesting that B. subtilis ribosomes are not affected by Cs+. However, it has been suggested that the influx of Cs+ into the cells of B. subtilis leads to an extreme decrease in K+ and that a shortage of K+ interferes with life support."

            "text": "In the present study, it was found that Cs+ treatment of B. subtilis increased the intracellular Cs+ concentration, similar to the trend observed in Mut4; therefore, it was presumed that the ribosomal complex would also be\u00a0 disrupted, but no significant effect was observed. This suggests that the degree of cell dependence on Mg2+ in the context of the strength of the ribosomal complex differs depending on the microbial species.\nIn TS-1, when the intracellular Cs+ concentration is \u2264200 mM, the Cs+ that flows into the cell competes with Mg2+ and destabilizes the ribosome. Therefore, we\u00a0inferred that the stability of the ribosomal complex was enhanced by maintaining a high intracellular Mg2+ concentration.\nProspects for these results include the application of the Cs+/H+ antiporter CshA in bioremediation using Mg2+ as an additive.\nBecause CshA is a low-affinity antiporter (apparent Km value of 250 mM for Cs+), it is not suitable for recovering low concentrations of Cs+. Therefore, its affinity should be\u00a0further improved. We\u00a0plan to elevate the affinity of CshA for Cs+ by molecular evolution engineering, such as error-prone PCR. In addition, when using microorganisms that accumulate Cs+ but have low Cs+ resistance for bioremediation, using Mg2+ as an additive is expected to enhance the Cs+ resistance of microorganisms and increase the efficiency of their recovery."
