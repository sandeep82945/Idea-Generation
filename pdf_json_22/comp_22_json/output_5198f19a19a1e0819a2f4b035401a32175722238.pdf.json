    "abstractText": "The Wilson-Cowan model can emulate gamma oscillations, and thus is extensively used to research the generation of gamma oscillations closely related to cognitive functions. Previous studies have revealed that excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the model can modulate its gamma oscillations. Inhibitory and excitatory self-feedback loops are important structural features of the model, however, its functional role in the regulation of gamma oscillations in the model is still unclear. In the present study, bifurcation analysis and spectrum analysis are employed to elucidate the regulating mechanism of gamma oscillations underlined by the inhibitory and excitatory self-feedback loops, especially how the two self-feedback loops cooperate to generate the gamma oscillations and regulate the oscillation frequency. The present results reveal that, on one hand, the inhibitory self-feedback loop is not conducive to the generation of gamma oscillations, and increased inhibitory self-feedback strength facilitates the enhancement of the oscillation frequency. On the other hand, the excitatory self-feedback loop promotes the generation of gamma oscillations, and increased excitatory self-feedback strength leads to the decrease of oscillation frequency. Finally, theoretical analysis is conducted to provide explain on how the two self-feedback loops play a crucial role in the generation and regulation of neural oscillations in the model. To sum up, Inhibitory and excitatory self-feedback loops play a complementary role in generating and regulating the gamma oscillation in Wilson-Cowan model, and cooperate to bidirectionally regulate the gamma-oscillation frequency in a more flexible manner. These results might provide testable hypotheses for future experimental research.",

Previous studies have revealed that excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the model can modulate its gamma oscillations. Inhibitory and excitatory self-feedback loops are important structural features of the model, however, its functional role in the regulation of gamma oscillations in the model is still unclear. In the present study, bifurcation analysis and spectrum analysis are employed to elucidate the regulating mechanism of gamma oscillations underlined by the inhibitory and excitatory self-feedback loops, especially how the two self-feedback loops cooperate to generate the gamma oscillations and regulate the oscillation frequency. The present results reveal that, on one hand, the inhibitory self-feedback loop is not conducive to the generation of gamma oscillations, and increased inhibitory self-feedback strength facilitates the enhancement of the oscillation frequency. On the other hand, the excitatory self-feedback loop promotes the generation of gamma oscillations, and increased excitatory self-feedback strength leads to the decrease of oscillation frequency. Finally, theoretical analysis is conducted to provide explain on how the two self-feedback loops play a crucial role in the generation and regulation of neural oscillations in the model. To sum up, Inhibitory and excitatory self-feedback loops play a complementary role in generating and regulating the gamma oscillation in Wilson-Cowan model, and cooperate to bidirectionally regulate the gamma-oscillation frequency in a more flexible manner. These results might provide testable hypotheses for future experimental research.\nKeywords: Wilson-Cowan model, gamma oscillations, self-feedback loops, bifurcation analysis, spectrum analysis\nINTRODUCTION\nGamma oscillation is a rhythmic electrical activity ranged from 30 to 80 Hz (Buzs\u00e1ki, 2009; Wang et al., 2011), which is widely present in the thalamus, cortex and hippocampus of animal and human brains (Womelsdorf and Fries, 2007), and is closely related to the cognitive function of animals and humans (Gevins et al., 1997; Engel et al., 2001; Bartos et al., 2007; Cabral et al., 2014). On the other hand, the abnormal gamma oscillation is an important cause of cognitive impairment and neurological disorders such as schizophrenia (Lewis et al., 2005; Light et al., 2006), autism (Orekhova et al., 2007; Milne et al., 2009) and language learning disorder (Heim et al., 2011).\nFrontiers in Systems Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 723237\nTherefore, studying the regulating mechanism of gamma oscillations is of great significance for understanding brain cognitive function and cognitive impairment.\nSo far, important progress has been made in physiological experimental research on gamma oscillations. In vitro experimental studies have shown that inhibitory interneurons are the key factor in the generation of gamma oscillations, and inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) is a necessary condition for the synchronization of gamma oscillations (Colgin and Moser, 2010). The synaptic connection strength between neurons plays an important role in the generation of gamma oscillations. Belluscio et al. (2012) showed that the interaction between excitation and inhibitory neurons can promote the generation of gamma oscillations. Atallah and Scanziani (2009) studied the potential regulating mechanism of gamma oscillations by recording the membrane potential inside and outside of rat cells, indicating that the connection strength between excitatory and inhibitory neurons can quickly adjust the frequency of gamma oscillations. Ray and Maunsell (2011) recorded local field potential (LPF) in the V1 brain area of rhesus monkeys to detect the origin of oscillations in different gamma bands. Ray et al. (2013) studied the effect of excitation and inhibition balance on gamma oscillations by recording the local field potential (LPF) in the MT area of rhesus monkeys, and found that visual stimuli would change the balance of excitability and inhibitory activity, and then adjust the gamma oscillations. Recent experimental studies have shown that visual stimuli plays an important role in inducing gamma oscillations and frequency modulation (Chen et al., 2017, 2020; Saleem et al., 2017; Veit et al., 2017; Welle and Contreras, 2017). Veit et al. (2017) used optogenetic technology to conduct mouse experiments and found that SOM (somatostatin) cells were stimulated to induce gamma oscillations, and inhibitory SOM cells would decrease the energy of gamma oscillations.\nComputational research is another important method to understand the regulating mechanism of gamma oscillations. Geisler et al. (2005) found that the input of the neuron model has a substantial impact on gamma oscillations, and the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic time constants can predict the model\u2019s frequency. The Wilson-Cowan model is a mesoscopic firing rate model proposed by Wilson and Cowan (1972), describing the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory populations. The model can simulate rich neural dynamics (Wilson and Cowan, 1972; Destexhe and Sejnowski, 2009), thus is widely used in research on gamma oscillation regulating mechanisms (Srinivasan et al., 2013; Jadi and Sejnowski, 2014b; Veltz and Sejnowski, 2015; Keeley et al., 2019). Srinivasan et al. (2013) showed that the background input has an important effect on the response of Wilson-Cowan model, and reproduced the important experimental phenomenon that theta oscillation modulates the gamma oscillation through simulation. Veltz and Sejnowski (2015) studied the regulation of gamma rhythm by periodic input and the phase-amplitude coupling mechanism between two neural groups by constructing two interconnected Wilson-Cowan models. Jadi and Sejnowski (2014b) found that the super-linear response of the sigmoid functions in the inhibitory population of the Wilson-Cowan model play a key role in modulating the frequency and power of the\nsimulated cortical gamma oscillations, furthermore, the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs into the model determine the frequency and power of oscillations. Jadi and Sejnowski (2014a) used two different stimulation methods to regulate the gamma oscillations in the excitatory and inhibitory coupled neural network, and revealed that stimulating the inhibitory neuron group can enhance the gamma oscillation power while stimulating the excitatory neuron group makes the gamma oscillation frequency larger. Keeley et al. (2019) have found that the time constants of excitatory and inhibitory populations have an important influence on the gamma oscillations in an extended Wilson-Cowan model. To sum up, the abovementioned research on the regulating mechanism of gamma oscillations in the Wilson-Cowan model mainly focuses on the effect of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, sigmoid functions, and time constants of excitatory and inhibitory populations on gamma oscillations.\nA self-feedback loop is a ubiquitous structure of neural circuits and neural networks. Computational studies have found that it has an important regulatory effect on brain electrical activity (Wilson and Cowan, 1972, 1973; Youssofzadeh et al., 2015). Moran et al. (2007, 2008) found that the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (Jansen and Rit, 1995) can successfully simulate gamma oscillations by introducing an inhibitory selffeedback loop into the model. Ursino et al. (2010) revealed that extended Jansen-Rit neural mass model (Wendling et al., 2010) can simulate gamma and beta oscillations simultaneously by introducing an inhibitory self-feedback loop into the fast inhibitory interneuron population. Wang et al. (2020) studied the effect of inhibitory self-feedback on the dynamics and oscillations of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GPe) neural circuit model, and demonstrated that inhibitory self-feedback exert an important effect on the generation and regulation of beta oscillations. These previous studies have shown that inhibitory self-feedback has an important effect on the dynamic characteristics and oscillation behavior of the Jansen-Rit neural mass model and its extended versions.\nExcitatory and inhibitory self-feedback loops are important structure features of the Wilson-Cowan model, however, it still remains to be addressed how the inhibitory self-feedback loop exerts an effect on the regulation of gamma oscillations in the model, furthermore, it is still unknown whether or not the excitatory self-feedback loop also plays a role in the regulation mechanism, especially the way the two loops cooperate to regulate the gamma oscillations. Here, by conducting bifurcation analysis and spectrum analysis, we aim to elucidate regulating mechanism of gamma oscillations in the Wilson-Cowan model underlined by the two self-feedback loops.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the section \u201cModel and Methods,\u201d the Wilson-Cowan model is described, which can produce gamma oscillations within certain parameter regions. In the section \u201cResults,\u201d by combining bifurcation analysis and spectrum analysis, we explore how inhibitory and excitatory self-feedback loops regulate gamma oscillations, respectively, and especially focus on elucidating the synergistic regulating mechanism underlined by the interaction of the two self-feedback loops.

When one or several parameters of the dynamic system are varied, the behavior of the system undergoes a qualitative change, such as the transformation between stable and unstable state, the appearance and disappearance of limit cycle, the emergence of chaos, and so on. These sudden changes are called bifurcations. The WilsonCowan model is a typical non-linear system with rich and complex dynamics (Borisyuk and Kirillov, 1992; Ledoux and Brunel, 2011), for example, a stable equilibrium point in the model corresponds to the resting state of neural mass, and the appearance of Hopf bifurcation points in the model indicates the transformation of the system from a stable equilibrium point to limit cycle oscillation which often corresponds to the periodic oscillatory electrical activity of the neural mass. Therefore, the model parameters highly influence the non-linear dynamic behavior of the Wilson-Cowan model, which plays an important role in revealing the principle of how gamma oscillation is generated and regulated.\nXPPAUT (Ermentrout, 2002) and MatCont (Dhooge et al., 2003) are commonly used software packages for bifurcation analysis to draw the dynamic trajectory diagram of the system as model parameters change. In this study, XPPAUT software is used for one-parameter bifurcation analysis, and Matcont is used for two-parameter bifurcation analysis. Particularly, only the positive values in the bifurcation diagram are biologically relevant, and the negative values are purely served as a mathematical description in order to generate the full bifurcation curves.\nThrough giving the fixed parameters and external inputs, the signal output of the model with time changing was simulated. Next, the Fourier transform was performed to determine the oscillation frequency of the model\u2019s output signals. Finally, the frequency distribution of the simulated limit cycle oscillations in a two-dimensional model parameter plane was obtained.

The bifurcation diagram is shown in Figure 3A, where HB represents the Hopf bifurcation point (WII = 2.019), the black solid line the stable equilibrium point, and the black dashed line the unstable equilibrium point. The model produces a limit cycle oscillation at the range of WII \u2264 2.019, corresponding to the blue curve area in Figure 3A. As shown in Figure 3A, the model exhibits a limit\ncycle oscillating state when the value of inhibitory self-feedback strength is small; with the increase of the inhibitory self-feedback strength, at the Hopf bifurcation point, the model switches from limit cycle oscillation to a unique stable fixed point state, and the oscillations disappear. Thus the bifurcation result indicates that increased inhibitory self-feedback strength is not conducive to the generation of gamma oscillations.\nNext, to explore how the inhibitory self-feedback loop regulates the oscillation frequency, we determined the oscillation frequency curve versus inhibitory self-feedback strength, shown in Figure 3B. It is suggested that increased inhibitory self-feedback strength results in the oscillation frequency to increasing.\nFurthermore, we conducted simulations to verify the bifurcation analysis result and oscillation frequency curve were correct.

The two-parameter bifurcation diagrams were obtained, as shown in Figure 4A, where the blue curve is the Hopf bifurcation curve. The behaviors of the model are divided into two regions in the plane (iI ,WII), denoted as 1 and 2 with different dynamic properties.

Thus an interesting question is how the two loops interact to exert an influence on the gamma oscillation. To address this problem, we further investigated the synergistic regulation of gamma oscillations by the cooperation of inhibitory and excitatory self-feedback loops in the WilsonCowan model.\nFirstly, we drew the two-parameter bifurcation diagram with respect to inhibitory and excitatory self-feedback strength, as shown in Figure 9A. The blue Hopf bifurcation curve divides the two-dimensional parameter plane (WII , WEE) into two regions, where the region denoted \u201c1\u201d stands for the limit cycle oscillation state, and the region labeled \u201c2\u201d is the monostable state.

Figure 9B indicates that the frequency of the limit cycle oscillation is mainly gamma band activity, and increased inhibitory self-feedback strength leads to the increase of the oscillation frequency, while increased excitatory self-feedback strength causes the oscillation frequency to decrease.\nFrontiers in Systems Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 723237"

            "text": "In this subsection, we further conduct a theoretical analysis to provide explanations on the generating and regulating mechanism of oscillations underlined by the excitatory and inhibitory self-feedback loops. Linear control theory is employed to bridge the relationship of self-feedback parameter WII and WEE with the oscillation characteristics of the WilsonCowan model.\nThe mathematical descriptions of the inhibitory and excitatory populations of the model, i.e., Eqs. (1, 2), can be reformulated in the form of{\n\u03c4I drI dt = \u2212rI + yI yI = GI (WIErE \u2212WIIrI + iI) (4)\n{ \u03c4E drE dt = \u2212rE + yE\nyE = GE (WEErE \u2212WEIrI + iE) (5)\nAccording to the structure shown as Figure 1, and the mathematical formulation as Eqs. (1, 2) of Wilson-Cowan model, we can derive the block diagram of the model, demonstrated as\nFigure 10, where the inhibitory population (blue part) is mainly composed of linear part hI(t) and non-linear sigmoid function GI (x), and excitatory population (red part) includes linear hE(t) and non-linear GE (x), where xrepresents the input of a sigmoid function, hI(t)and hE(t)are the impulse response functions of \u03c4I drI dt = \u2212rI + yI and \u03c4E drE dt = \u2212rE + yE, respectively.\nFirstly, we will explore how the inhibitory self-feedback loop exerts an effect on the oscillation of the Wilson-Cowan model. We approximate the inhibitory sigmoid function GI (x)in the inhibitory population with the first-order Taylor expansion KI = dGI(x)dx . The Laplace transformation of the linear function hI(t)can be formulated as HI(s) = 1\u03c4 I s+1 .\nWhen there is no inhibitory self-feedback loop in the inhibitory population, i.e., WII = 0, the transfer function of the inhibitory population is defined as the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output variable to the Laplace transform of the input variable, thus we derived it as follows\n\u03c6I(s) = KIHI(s) = KI\n\u03c4Is+ 1 (6)\nFrontiers in Systems Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 9 February 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 723237\nFIGURE 9 | The impact of the interaction between inhibitory self-feedback strength WII and excitatory self-feedback strength WEE on the dynamical behavior of the Wilson-Cowan model. (A) The two-parameter bifurcations with respect to WII and WEE ; (B) Frequency distribution diagrams. The blue curve represents the Hopf bifurcation curves, BT represents Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation, the area labeled 1 represents limit cycle oscillations, and the area labeled 2 represents fixed-point state.\nThen, by substituting s = j\u03c9 into Eq. (6), we obtain Fourier transformation, i.e., the frequency response characteristics of the inhibitory population as:\n\u03c6I(j\u03c9) = KIHI(j\u03c9) = KI\nj\u03c4I\u03c9+ 1 (7)\nObviously, the equivalent gain and time constant of the inhibitory population without an inhibitory self-feedback loop are KI and \u03c4I , respectively.\nFurthermore, according to the blue part of the block diagram shown in Figure 10, we can derive\nRI(s) = [II(s)\u2212 RI(s)WII] \u03c6I(s)\nwhich can be formulated as\nRI(s) [1+WII\u03c6I(s)] = II(s)\u03c6I(s)\nFIGURE 10 | Block diagram of Wilson-Cowan model. The blue part represents the inhibitory population, and the red part is the excitatory population, respectively.\nThus, we obtained the closed-loop transfer function of the inhibitory population with inhibitory self-feedback, i.e., the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output variable to the Laplace transform of the input variable of the inhibitory population, as follows:\n\u03c6 \u2032 I(s) = RI(s) II(s) = \u03c6I(s) 1+WII\u03c6I(s) (8-1)\nwhere RI(s) and II(s) are the Laplace transform of the output variable rI(t)and the Laplace transform of the input variable iI(t) of the inhibitory population, respectively.\nSubstituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (8\u20131), we further derived\n\u03c6 \u2032 I(s) = KI \u00b7HI(s)\n1+WIIKI \u00b7HI(s) (8-2)\nBy substituting s = j\u03c9 into Eq. (8\u20132), we further obtained the frequency response characteristics of the inhibitory population as:\n\u03c6 \u2032 E(j\u03c9) = KI \u00b7HI(j\u03c9)\n1+WIIKI \u00b7HI(j\u03c9)\n= KI\n1+WIIKI + \u03c4I j\u03c9\n= KI/(1+WIIKI)\n1+ \u03c4I j\u03c9/\u03c4I j\u03c9(1+WIIKI)\n= K \u2032I\n1+ \u03c4\u2032I j\u03c9\nwhere K \u2032 I = KI / (1+WIIKI)\n\u03c4 \u2032\nI = \u03c4I\n/ (1+WIIKI)\n(9)\nand K \u2032 I is the equivalent gain, and \u03c4 \u2032 I the equivalent time constant of the inhibitory population, respectively.\nFrontiers in Systems Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 10 February 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 723237\nThus we can draw the following conclusion{ K \u2032\nI < KI \u03c4 \u2032 I < \u03c4I (10)\nEquations 9, 10 demonstrate that the inhibitory self-feedback loop, i.e., the introduction of WII into the inhibitory population, causes both the equivalent gain and time constant of the inhibitory population to be decreased. It should be pointed that this conclusion does not depend on the selection of the other model parameters. According to the control and dynamics theory (Franklin et al., 1994), we can conclude that the decreased equivalent gain prevents the model from generating oscillation, obviously, the decreased equivalent time constant results in the oscillation frequency increased.\nFor the excitatory population, using the same analysis method as the above mentioned, we determined the transfer function of the excitatory population without excitatory self-feedback as follows\n\u03c6E(s) = RE(s) IE(s) = KEHE(s) = KE \u03c4Es+ 1 (11)\nwhere KI = dGE(x)dx is the linear approximation of the excitatory sigmoid function GE (x)in the excitatory population with the first-order Taylor expansion, and He(s) = 1\u03c4Es+1 the Laplace transformation of the linear function hE (t).\nThe transfer function of the excitatory population with excitatory self-feedback can be derived as follows\n\u03c6 \u2032 E(s) = RE(s) IE(s) = \u03c6E(s) 1+WEE\u03c6E(s) (12-1)\nSubstituting Eq. (11) into Eq. (12\u20131), we further derived\n\u03c6 \u2032 E(s) = KE \u00b7HE(s)\n1+WEEKE \u00b7HE(s) (12-2)\nBy substituting s = j\u03c9 into Eq. (12\u20132), we obtained\n\u03c6 \u2032 E(j\u03c9) = KE / (1\u2212WEEKE)\n1+ \u03c4Ej\u03c9 / (1\u2212WEEKE) = K \u2032 E 1+ \u03c4\u2032Ej\u03c9\nwhere K \u2032 E = KE / (1\u2212WEEKE)\n\u03c4 \u2032\nE = \u03c4E\n/ (1\u2212WEEKE)\n(13)\nand K \u2032 E is the equivalent gains, and \u03c4 \u2032 E the equivalent time constants of the excitatory population without and with excitatory self-feedback loop, respectively.\nObviously, we can draw the following conclusion for the excitatory population {\nK \u2032\nE > KE \u03c4 \u2032 E > \u03c4E (14)\nThus, the excitatory self-feedback loop results in the increased gain and time constants of the excitatory population, which demonstrates that the excitatory self-feedback loop facilities the generation of oscillation, and causes the oscillation frequency to decrease."

            "text": "From the view point of biological meaning, the self-feedback loop corresponds to an autapse (Auto-synapse) in a neural circuit. Separate from synapses between different neurons, an autapse is an unusual kind of synapse that connects to the neuron itself, which was first discovered in 1972 in the pyramidal cell of neocortex cerebri by Van der Loos and Glaser (1972). Experimental studies have found that autapses has been observed in various brain regions such as in the neocortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum (Loos and Glaser, 1972; Bekkers and Stevens, 1991; G\u00e1bor et al., 1997; Bacci et al., 2003). Especially, autapses can form a self-feedback loop in a neuron. Meanwhile, the autapse plays a rich role in the regulation of neuron firing and neural rhythm. Biological experiments suggest that inhibitory self-feedback can suppress neuron firing (Saa Da et al., 2009), while excitatory self-feedback can promote neuron firing (Yin et al., 2018). In addition, Connelly has found that self-feedback plays a crucial role in enhancing the synchrony of the membrane potential across the entire network during the neocortical gamma oscillations (Connelly, 2014). Recently, by using the axon patch-clamp recording technique, research has shown that a self-feedback loop in the neuron can promote neuronal responsiveness, burst firing, and coincidence detection in these neocortical principal cells (Yin et al., 2018). Different from these previous studies, the present results reveal the regulating mechanism of neural oscillations underlined by excitatory and inhibitory autapses at the level of population. Furthermore, we conducted a theoretical analysis to provide explanation of these regulating mechanisms, which can shed light on a deeper understanding of the role of excitatory and inhibitory autapses play in achieving brain functions and causing neural disorders.\nGamma oscillations are closely related to brain functions, for example, learning and memory. Most previous studies focused on the synapse between different neurons how to influence brain functions; the investigations in this paper might provide an avenue to understand autapse underlined brain function mechanisms. Moreover, abnormal neural oscillations are an important biomarker of many kinds of neural diseases, such as epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, etc. The present results can bridge the relationship between the neural oscillations and excitatory and inhibitory autapses, which may provide some guidelines and predictions for future experimental studies on how autapses exert an impact on brain functions and neural diseases."

            "text": "The Wilson-Cowan model can generate gamma oscillations and is extensively employed to study the regulation mechanism of gamma oscillations. Excitatory and inhibitory self-feedback loops are typical connection modes of the model, however, it is unclear how the two self-feedback loops exert an effect on the regulation of gamma oscillations in the model. The results suggest that inhibitory self-feedback is not conducive to the generation of gamma oscillations, while excitatory self-feedback promotes it. Moreover, The increased inhibitory self-feedback strength causes\nFrontiers in Systems Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 11 February 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 723237\nthe oscillation frequency to increase, and with the increase of excitatory self-feedback strength, the oscillation frequency is decreased. It should be noted that these conclusions do not depend on the selection of the other model parameters. Taken together, these results reveal that inhibition and excitatory selffeedback loops play a complementary role in the generation and regulation of gamma oscillations. Through the cooperation of the two self-feedback loops, a flexible bidirectional regulation of gamma oscillations in the Wilson-Cowan model can be achieved.\nIn the present study, there are some limitations as follows: The study builds on the parameters from the previous research, such as the works conducted by Ledoux & Brunel and Jadi & Sejnowski. As opposed to the previous study of Jadi and Sejnowski, the present study mainly focuses on exploring how the inhibitory and excitatory self-feedback loops regulate the neural oscillations of the Wilson-Cowan model and has no direct relationship to external inputs corresponding to sensory inputs. The results have revealed that the excitatory and inhibitory self-feedback loops have an important effect on the underlined regulatory mechanisms of the model inputs, neural oscillations, which implies that the two self-feedback loops may exert impact on the response of the model to some sensory inputs. In the future, experimental research could be further conducted to verify the present conclusions."
