    "abstractText": "The unique properties of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polysulfone (PSf), such as good membrane-forming ability and adjustable structure, provide a great opportunity for CO2-separation membrane development. This work focuses on the fabrication of PVA/PSf composite membranes for CO2/N2 separations. The membranes prepared by coating a 7.5 wt% PVA on top of PSf substrate showed a relatively thin selective layer of 1.7 \u03bcm with an enhanced CO2/N2 selectivity of 78, which is a ca. 200% increase compared to the pure PSf membranes. The CO2/N2 selectivity decreases at a rapid rate with the increase of feed pressure from 1.8 to 5 bar, while the CO2 permeance shows a slight reduction, which is caused by the weakening of coupling transportation between water and CO2 molecules, as well as membrane compaction at higher pressures. Increasing operating temperature from 22 \u25e6C to 50 \u25e6C leads to a slight decrease in CO2 permeance, but a significant reduction in the CO2/N2 selectivity from 78 to 27.1. Moreover, the mass transfer coefficient of gas molecules is expected to increase at a higher velocity, which leads to the increase of CO2 permeance at higher feed flow rates. It was concluded that the CO2 separation performance of the prepared membranes was significantly dependent on the membrane operating parameters, and process design and optimization are crucial to bringing CO2-separation membranes for industrial applications in post-combustion carbon capture.",

            "text": "With the acceleration of industrialization, the emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere have increased dramatically around the world, which causes a significant global warming issue. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is considered one of the most promising ways to mitigate CO2 emissions [1]. Compared to the conventional separation techniques such as absorption, adsorption, and cryogenic distillation, membrane separation technology offers the advantages of lower energy consumption, flexible operation, smaller footprint, and less or no chemical requirement, which shows great potential for CO2 separation [2\u20134]. Different types of membrane materials such as dense polymers, mixed matrix membranes, facilitated transport membranes, and inorganic membranes have been developed for gas separations. Among them, inorganic membranes are usually highly costly [5], which limits their large-scale applications for CO2 capture from flue gas where a huge membrane area is usually required to process a high-volume flow of a gas stream, especially in power plants [6]. Polymeric membranes are much more available in industrial CO2 separations due to their relatively high gas permeability, easy assembling process, good chemical stability, and\nPolymers 2023, 15, 124. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15010124 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 124 2 of 11\nrelatively low cost [7,8]. However, polymeric membranes are usually suffering from the trade-off between gas permeability and selectivity, which means high gas permeability will be usually accompanied by low selectivity and vice versa [9]. It was reported that none of the pure polymeric membranes can surpass the Robeson upper bound for the CO2-N2 separation pair [10]. To successfully implement the membrane technology for industrial CO2 capture, novel membrane materials should be developed to overcome this trade-off to bring down capital cost related to the required membrane area (determined by gas permeability) and the operating cost related to the energy demand [10,11]. Novel strategies should be developed to ensure that the membrane performance reaches the top-right corner of the upper bound plot. Although the upper bound is only applied originally to dense polymeric membranes, gas permeability and selectivity are still the two main parameters to characterize the separation performances for any membrane materials [12,13]. Various ways exhibit performance that exceeds the upper bound, such as mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) [14], hybrid membranes [15], and composite membranes. Among them, composite membranes show significant potential for enhanced CO2 separation performance, as is evident from their widespread applications in liquid or gas separations [16]. Polysulfone (PSf) membrane is widely used as polymeric support due to the advantages of low material cost, high mechanical strength, and good thermal and chemical stabilities [17]. Such material can form a porous structure with regular micropores, which is suitable for fabricating high-performance gas separation membranes [18]. Meanwhile, some literature reported that the hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) can form a dense selective layer to present a highly swelling behavior with good film-forming properties [19,20]. It is worth noting that pure PSf or PVA membranes cannot achieve high selectivity and permeance simultaneously [21,22], but the combination can significantly improve gas permeance while maintaining a high selectivity, as reported by Chung et al. [23]. Peng et al. [24,25] demonstrated that the PVA/PSf composite nanofiltration membranes fabricated by multi-step coating above PSf with a defect-free PVA layer showed improved membrane performance. Moreover, it was also reported that high-performance composite membranes can be formed by combining these two polymers [26], although the preparation of a completely defect-free membrane is still challenging. However, the incompatibility between the hydrophobic PSf substrate and the hydrophilic top layer may lead to delimitation [27,28], which lowers the membrane stability and lifetime and limits its application. In order to address this issue, some literature reported introducing a surfactant of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) into the coating solution to enhance the adhesion and compatibility [29,30]. Although adding PVA selective layer can enhance the selectivity, the permeabilities of the penetrants were still low under dry conditions, as reported by Chao et al. [31], as the hydrogen bonds of the polymer chain hinder CO2 and N2 permeation [32]. Therefore, it is crucial to operate this type of membrane in a humidified condition [33] where the polymer chain can be swelled to enhance the gas diffusivity coefficient. It was reported that water molecules can break the hydrogen bonds between molecules and reduce the crystallinity of the PVA chain [34], and thus the CO2/N2 selectivity and CO2 permeability for the water-swollen PVA membranes were significantly improved, which is mainly caused by the enhanced gas diffusivity inside the polymer matrix (Permeability = diffusivity \u00d7 solubility coefficient), while the increase of N2 diffusivity is not as significant as CO2 due to the competing transport, and thus leads to the increase of CO2/N2 selectivity as well [35]. However, a systematic investigation of the membrane preparation parameters and the optimal operating condition on the PVA/PSf composite membrane performances is still lacking. Therefore, in this work, the membrane preparation parameters such as PVA content and coating thickness were optimized to identify the best condition for fabricating highperformance composite membranes, and the process operating parameters for CO2/N2 separation were also systematically tested.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 124 3 of 11"

A pre-mixed gas of 10 vol% CO2 and 90 vol% N2 was fed into the membrane module at a given flow rate controlled by a mass flow controller (MFC, Bronkhorst, Ruurlo, The Netherlands). The relative humidity (RH, fully humidified) of feed gas was controlled by passing the gas through a humidifier equipped with heating jacket. The feed and permeate lines and the module can be heated to the desired testing temperature by heating trace. Argon was used as a sweep gas to create the driving force to dilute the penetrated gases, and to ensure that the permeate gas continuously flowed to gas chromatography (GC, Shimadzu GC-2014, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for gas composition measurements. The feed and permeate pressures were controlled by two back-pressure controllers (BPC, Alicat, Alicat Scientific, Tucson, AZ, USA). It is worth noting that feed pressure of 2 bar is widely used in real-life applications due to the expected significantly increased power demand for the flue gas compression to be operated at a higher feed pressure. Therefore, most testing experiments were conducted at the feed pressure of 2 bar, except for the influence of feed flow rate, where feed pressure of 3 bar was used. The process operating parameters such as feed pressure, temperature, and gas flow rate were systematically investigated to document their influences on the separation performances of the developed membranes.

However, a further increase in the polymer concentration may lead to the formation of a denser layer, and thus reduce the CO2 and N2 transportation through the membranes, which results in the decrease of both CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 selectivity. Therefore, 7.5 wt% was identified as the best condition for making PVA/PSf composite membranes, which were further tested for CO2/N2 separations at different operating conditions. It should be noted that the composite membranes present lower gas permeance\nPolymers 2023, 15, 124 7 of 11\ncompared to the pure PSf membranes (washed with tap water), as the extra PVA layer causes additional transport resistance [39,40]. Moreover, lower molecular weight PVA fractions might penetrate the PSf matrix to decrease the pore size of the substrate or cause pore blocking and thus leading to the decrease of gas permeance. Future work on seeking better support materials with higher gas permeances should be pursued to enhance the membrane performance.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 12 3.4.1. Effect of the PVA Concentration It can be found that gas permeance and selectivity of PVA/PSf composite membranes\nincrease with the increase of the PVA concentration in the coating solutions as shown in Figure 6.

Effect of Feed Flow Rate The feed flow rate, varying from 100\u2013500 Nml/min with a constant sweep gas flow of 20 Nml/min under the feed pressure and temperature of 3 bar and 25 \u00b0C, respectively, was conducted to investigate its influence on the separation performance for the 7.5 wt% PVA/PSf membrane. It should be noted that it is difficult to get the higher flow rate of >300 Nml/min when the feed pressure is controlled at 2 bar by a back-pressure controller. Therefore, the feed pressure of 3 bar was applied for the variation of the feed flow rate, and the results are shown in Figure 7. It can be seen that CO2 permeance increases from 2.3 to 5.7 GPU with the increase of the feed flow rate. It should be noted that the gas velocity that passes through the given cross-sectional area of the membrane module increases at higher feed flow rates. Therefore, the mass transfer coefficient of gas molecules is expected to increase at a higher velocity [41], hence increasing the gas permeance. However, it is worth noting that both CO2 and N2 permeances will increase simultaneously as the mass transfer enhancement contributes to all gas molecules. Thus, the CO2/N2 selectivity does not present a significant change, as indicated in Figure 7. Further increasing the feed flow may enhance the gas permeance if a stable operation can be achieved at the\n3.4.2. Effect of Feed Flow Rate\nThe feed flow rate, varying from 100\u2013500 NmL/min with a constant sweep gas flow of 20 NmL/min under the feed pressure and temperature of 3 bar and 25 \u25e6C, respectively, was conducted to investigate its influence on the separation performance for the 7.5 wt% PVA/PSf membrane. It should be noted that it is difficult to get the higher flow rate of >300 NmL/min when the feed pressure is controlled at 2 bar by a back-pressure controller. Therefore, the feed pressure of 3 bar was applied for the variation of the feed flow rate, and the results are shown in Figure 7.

It should be noted that the gas velocity that passes through the given cross-sectional area of the membra e module increases at higher feed flow rates. Therefore, the mass transfer coefficient of gas olecules is expected to increase at a higher velocity [41], hence increasing the gas perm ance. However, it is worth noting that both CO2 and N2 permeances will increase simult neously as the mass transfer enhanceme t con ributes to ll gas molecules. Thus, the CO2/N2 selectivity does not pre ent a signific t change, as indicated in Figure 7. Further increasing the feed flow ma enhance the gas permeance if a stable operation can be achiev d at the give pre sure. However, the feed gas to be process d by a specific membrane area (i.e., the ratio betwe n feed flow and membrane area) is designed in the real-life application, and a membrane system is usually operated at a relatively high stage-cut. It is expected that the commercial modules should be operated at a low or moderate feed flow. Therefore, much higher feed flow rates of >600 NmL/min have not been conducted in this work.\n3.4.3. Effect of Operating Temperature\nThe gas permeation tests were conducted at different operating temperatures for the best membranes prepared by coating a 7.5 wt% PVA solution. The system was tested at the constant feed and sweep flow rates of 300 and 20 NmL/min with a feed pressure of 2 bar, and the results are shown in Figure 8. When the temperature increases from 22 to 50 \u25e6C, the CO2 permeance decreases slightly, but the CO2/N2 selectivity decreases significantly from 78.0 to 27.1. It is expected that the gas diffusivity will increase at higher\nPolymers 2023, 15, 124 8 of 11\noperating temperatures due to kinetic domination [41]. However, from the thermodynamic point of view, the CO2 solubility coefficient decreases on the contrary. Overall, the CO2 permeance decreases with the increase in operating temperature, which means that this type of membrane might be more suitable for low or moderate operating temperatures. Moreover, the N2 solubility coefficient will not be significantly influenced by temperature due to its less condensability, so the N2 permeance slightly increases with the increase of temperature as the diffusivity dominates the N2 transportation through the membranes. Therefore, it presents a slight decrease in CO2/N2 selectivity at higher temperatures. However, it is worth noting that water vapor plays a significant role in the swelling of the membrane. Due to the limitation related to the equipment design, stable operation at high relative humidity (RH) cannot be achieved at higher operating temperatures. This should be further investigated in future work to split the influence of RH and temperature. Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 12 given pressure.

Dependence of the membrane performances on the operating temperature under a feed press re of 2 bar.\n3.4.4. Effect of Feed Pressure Even though CO2 capture from flue gas is usually operated at relatively low feed pressure to avoid a significantly high energy consumption for the feed gas compression, it is worth investigating the membrane performance at different pressures to balance the operating cost related to power demand and the capital cost of the membrane unit. Therefore, the feed pressure variation from 1.8 to 5 bar was conducted under the constant feed and permeate flow rates of 300 and 20 Nml/min at 25 \u00b0C. The obtained membrane separation performances of CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 selectivity are shown in Figure 9. It can be seen that the CO2/N2 selectivity decreases at a rapid rate with feed pressure, while the CO2 permeance shows a slight reduction. It is expected that the absolute water vapor content at high pressures decreases, which leads to the weakening of coupling transportation between water and CO2 molecules. Moreover, high feed pressure causes the compacting of the membrane matrix to reduce the swelling effect. These two factors contribute to the reduction of CO2 permeation together. However, due to the decrease in membrane swelling, the competing transport between the N2 and CO2 molecules is expected to become more significant, which leads to a great reduction in the CO2/N2 selectivity. Therefore, it can be concluded that a relatively low feed pressure operation is preferable for the prepared PVA/PSf composite membranes to achieve a high separation performance for CO2 capture from flue gas.\nFigure 8.

Conclusions PVA/PSf composite membranes were successfully prepared by coating a selective layer on top of PSf substrate. The composite membranes presented better separation performance compared to the pure PSf membranes, which indicates that coating PVA on PSf can effectively improve the membrane selectivity compared to the pure PSf support membranes. Under the same condition, a 7.5 wt% PVA coating solution is more suitable to achieve high performance, with a slightly lower CO2 permeance 3.4 GPU and 78.2 CO2/N2 selectivity, based on the results of the influences of polymer concentration on the membrane separation performance. As for the feed flow rate test, the membrane experiences a significant increase in CO2 permeance from 2.3 GPU at 100 Nml/min to 5.7 GPU at 500 Nml/min, while the CO2/N2 selectivity remains stable with slight upward redundancy, which is mainly caused by the enhanced mass transfer coefficient. With the increase of operating temperature, CO2 permeance decreases due to the significant reduction from the dominating parameter of the CO2 solubility coefficient. Thus, this type of membrane may be more suitable for low or moderate operating temperatures. Moreover, the composite membranes cannot maintain good separation performance under high-pressure operation due to the weakening of coupling transportation between water and CO2 molecules, as the absolute water vapor content decreases at higher feed pressures. In addition, high feed pressure causes membrane compaction to reduce the swelling effect. Therefore, process design and optimization are very important for bringing such materials into reallife industrial CO2 capture.\nAuthor Contributions: Y.L.: Formal analysis, investigation, data curation, writing\u2014original draft, visualization.
