    "abstractText": "The absolute structure of the 3D MOF anhydrous zinc (II) tartrate with space group I222 has been determined for both [Zn(L-TAR)] and [Zn(D-TAR)] by electron diffraction using crystals of submicron dimensions. Dynamical refinement gives a strong difference in R factors for the correct and inverted structures. These anhydrous MOFs may be prepared phase pure from mild hydrothermal conditions. Powder X-ray diffraction indicates that isostructural or pseudo-isostructural phases can be similarly prepared for several other M2+ = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu. I222 is a relatively uncommon space group since it involves intersecting two-fold axes that place constraints on molecular crystals. However, in the case of MOFs the packing is dominated by satisfying the octahedral coordination centers. These MOFs are dense 3D networks with chiral octahedral metal centers that may be classed as \u2206 (for L-TAR) or \u039b (for D-TAR).",

            "text": "The development of electron diffraction (ED, also termed 3D-ED or micro-ED) as a technique for structure determination applicable to organic molecular compounds, inorganics, and metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged in the last 10 years [1\u20137]. The advent of commercial electron diffractometers promises to usher in a new age of structural determination for crystalline materials that, either due to lack of material or inherent problems of crystal growth, cannot produce single specimens of suitable size for in-house X-ray diffractometers (typically around 50 \u00b5m, in certain cases even down to ca. 10 \u00b5m) [8]. In researching metal tartrates [9,10], which are of potential interest as fundamental chiral metal\u2013organic frameworks that might have chiral separation [11], chiral catalytic [12], or chiro-optic applications [13] we found that simply formulated anhydrous materials such as [Zn(L-TAR)] could be prepared straightforwardly under mild hydrothermal conditions (Figure 1). At ambient conditions several metal tartrate phases had been crystallized and X-ray structures previously reported, with both coordinated aqua ligands and poreincluded water molecules. These include [Zn(L-TAR)(H2O)]\u00b71.5H2O (CSD codename CUJBAK) [14], [Zn(D-TAR)(H2O)]\u00b71.5H2O (CUJBAK01) [15], a diastereomeric framework [Zn(L-TAR)(H2O)]\u00b72H2O (KURNOB) [16], and a meso compound [Zn(m-TAR)(H2O)2] (MUYPUU) [17]. The structure of an anhydrous phase has not been reported in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) so far. This is likely due to the fact that whilst hydrothermal preparation of [Zn(L-TAR)] was possible, the resulting micro-crystalline powders precluded X-ray structure determination due to small particle size <10 microns. The application of 3D-ED to the structure determination of MOFs with small particle size has been well established [5\u20137,18,19]. We were curious to see whether the as grown micro-crystals of [Zn(L-TAR)] could be amenable to structure determination using 3D-ED. Furthermore, since the crystals should be homochiral, the determination of their absolute\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 983. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15050983 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 983 2 of 13\nstructure is also of interest.

The later parts of measurements showing significant beam damage were omitted. Further details can be found in Table 1.\nData for kinematical refinement were processed and evaluated using the APEX4 software package [24]. After unit cell determination the frames were integrated and corrected for Lorentz effects, scan speed, background, and absorption using SAINT and SADABS [25,26]. Space group determination was based on systematic absences, E statistics, and successful refinement of the structure. The structure was solved using ShelXD and refined with ShelXL in conjunction with ShelXle [27\u201329]. Least squares refinements were carried out within the kinematic approximation by minimizing \u03a3w(Fobs2-Fcalc2)2 with the ShelXL weighting scheme and using neutral electron scattering factors [28,30]. Due to the low amount of data, all atoms were refined with isotropic displacement parameters. H atoms were placed in calculated positions based on typical distances for neutron diffraction and refined with a riding model and Uiso(H) = 1.2\u00b7Ueq(C), for hydroxy H atoms Uiso(H) = 1.5\u00b7Ueq(O) was used and angles were refined freely. Data for dynamical refinement were processed using the PETS2 software package [31]. After unit cell determination the frames were integrated, corrected for pattern orientation and beam position, and merged into overlapping virtual frames with a tilt range of 3\u25e6 and an offset between frames of 2\u25e6 [21]. Dynamical refinement was performed using JANA2020 starting with the structure from kinematical refinement as initial model [32]. Least squares refinements were carried out by minimizing \u03a3w(Iobs \u2212 Icalc)2 based on dynamical diffraction intensities and assuming uniform thickness of the crystals. All atoms were refined with isotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms were treated in the same way as for kinematical refinement as a free refinement of bond lengths led to very long C-H bonds of ca. 1.3 \u00c5, which seems excessive even though a certain elongation as compared to neutron diffraction data is expected [21]."

Discussion 4.1. Structure and Absolute Structure Determination\nThe zinc tartrate phases represent a typical application example for the 3D-ED technique when X-ray crystallography fails due to small particle size < 1 \u00b5m. The diffraction patterns from numerous specimens were scanned but the majority showed twinning or intergrowth problems. One benefit of electron diffraction is that in imaging mode individual crystals can quickly be identified and then studied for diffraction. After a suitable crystal was identified by its pattern, the intensity data were collected in continuous rotation mode. Due to beam damage the maximum exposure for crystals is limited before structural degradation occurs, so a rapid intensity data collection was necessitated. The orthorhombic symmetry of the pattern meant that hkl coverage was acceptable just from one crystallite. The successful solution and reasonable quality of the refined structural model using the kinematic approximation gave R1 = 16.7% for [Zn(L-TAR)]. This then led us to attempt a dynamical refinement in order to determine the absolute structure. This was carried out using JANA2020 [32] which is so far the only publicly available program with this ability and has been used to establish absolute structures in various cases, most of them organic molecules related to pharma [20,21]. The application of this approach gave R1 = 11.8% (MR1 = 11.6%) for the correct hand (2R, 3R) and R1 = 14.5% (MR1 = 15.0%) for the inverted (2S, 3S) structure, whereas there is no difference in R1 at all for the inversion of the kinematically refined structure. The difference of approximately 3 percentage points along with a z-score of ca. 4.3\u03c3 allows for unequivocal absolute structure identification. As a confirming experiment, a fresh sample of [Zn(D-TAR)] was prepared and analyzed in the same way. The results on the 1-D specimen are in good agreement with the data for 1-L\nFigure 6.
