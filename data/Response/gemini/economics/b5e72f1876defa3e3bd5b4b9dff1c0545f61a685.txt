1. **Investigate the impact of different health measures on the estimation of excess work capacity.** This study used the PVW health index as a comprehensive measure of health, but other health measures could also be used, such as the SF-36 or the EQ-5D. It would be interesting to compare the results of using different health measures to see how they affect the estimation of excess work capacity.
2. **Examine the relationship between excess work capacity and other factors, such as socioeconomic status, occupation, and industry.** This study only examined the relationship between excess work capacity and health, but other factors could also play a role. For example, socioeconomic status could affect access to healthcare and other resources that could improve health and increase excess work capacity. Occupation and industry could also affect the physical and mental demands of work, which could in turn affect excess work capacity.
3. **Conduct a longitudinal study to track the excess work capacity of older women over time.** This study was cross-sectional, so it could not track the excess work capacity of older women over time. A longitudinal study would be able to provide more information about how excess work capacity changes with age and other factors.
4. **Develop a policy simulation model to assess the impact of different delayed retirement policies on the labor force participation of older women.** This study estimated the excess work capacity of older women, but it did not assess the impact of different delayed retirement policies on the labor force participation of older women. A policy simulation model could be used to assess the impact of different policies on the labor force participation of older women and to identify the policies that are most likely to achieve the desired outcomes.
5. **Conduct a qualitative study to explore the experiences of older women who have delayed retirement.** This study used quantitative data to estimate the excess work capacity of older women, but it did not explore the experiences of older women who have delayed retirement. A qualitative study could provide more information about the challenges and benefits of delaying retirement and could help to identify ways to make the transition to retirement smoother for older women.
