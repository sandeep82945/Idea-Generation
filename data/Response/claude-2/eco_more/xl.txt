 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Investigate more complex production network structures with additional production stages, items, and resources. This could provide insights into how the performance of the different planning approaches scales.

2. Incorporate additional sources of uncertainty beyond demand and setup times, such as machine breakdowns or variable processing times. This would allow evaluating the robustness of plans in a more realistic stochastic environment. 

3. Explore alternative methods for generating scenarios for the stochastic optimization model, such as sampling from historical data or applying time series forecasting models. This could improve the quality of the scenarios.

4. Evaluate the integration of the proposed simulation-optimization framework with other planning approaches like Kanban or CONWIP. Comparisons could identify strengths and weaknesses.

5. Implement the framework in a real production environment and quantify the actual performance improvement compared to the company's current planning approach. This would demonstrate the practical viability of the methods.
