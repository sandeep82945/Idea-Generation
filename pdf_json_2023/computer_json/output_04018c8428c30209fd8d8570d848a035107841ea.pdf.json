Other researchers have used Metaverse for interactive collaboration in online classes [3] to explore its pedagogical effects. Some educational institutions have currently collaborated with Second Life platforms to build learning environments [4], such as some researchers focusing on the design and implementation of immersive learning environments [5]. The emergence of Metaverse meetings overcomes a series of problems that existed during previous virtual space interactions, such as too little interaction, screens blocking emotional communication [6], and poor learning outcomes [7]. It allows multiple users to use virtual reality technology to enter the virtual meeting room for interaction [8]. This gives users an immersive experience and optimizes the overall effect of the meeting. In addition, it has great potential as a learning and practice platform for communication and dialogue [9]. It provides an economical, individualized dialogue scenario [10]. In this context, learners can overcome their lack of confidence in pronunciation, grammatical correctness, and the shyness that most of them may have. This helps them enter an effective \"conversation\". It is particularly positive in terms of taking the first steps towards \"dialogue\"."

            "text": "The model of the hybrid recommendation system consists of three main components and a set-reference impact factor \u03b2: existed information model, potential interest model, hybrid recommendation algorithm model, and information about the characteristics of the learning group corresponding to the learning resources (impact factor \u03b2). Then, we define the above three components and set the reference impact factors here.\nExisted information model (EIM): In deep learning, diverse raw data inputs can cause the distribution of feature values to vary widely. It is necessary to convert it into a form that can be recognized by the framework in advance. This operation, to some extent, can effectively respond to the basic personal information of different learner\u2019s initialized multiple educational backgrounds, learning abilities, self-perceptions, emotional tendencies, and interest levels. They are. We quantified age, gender, education, profession, identity, style, emotion, and hobby as feature vectors. And after the subsequently described TF-IDF algorithm for calculating the feature weights, we finally obtained the weight vectors of their different feature values. They are denoted here as EIM = {e11, e12, e13, ......, e18}, and called the existed information model.\nPotential interest model (PIM): The PIM is defined here to identify the neighbors of the current user by using the KNN collaborative filtering algorithm as described later. Neighbors are groups of users who have similar interests to the current learner and have common learning resources to utilize. We define the potential interest model as the\nexisted information model of its neighbors who have similar interests and are members of the same learning user group. And after the subsequently described TF-IDF algorithm for calculating the feature weights, we finally obtained the weight vectors of their different feature values. They are denoted as PIM = {p11, p12, p13, ......, p18}, and is called the potential interest model.\nHybrid recommendation algorithm model (HRAM): Hybrid recommendation algorithm model is the weight vector. We merge the above two models (EIM+PIM) according to certain logical rules and mathematical operations to get it (in this paper, we use the calculation of cosine similarity). They are denoted as H1 = {h11, h12, h13, ......, h18}, and is called the hybrid recommendation algorithm model. Finally, it combines with the consideration of the factors affecting the numerator and presents the personalized recommendation reference content generated by a hybrid recommendation system.\nFor the hybrid recommendation algorithm model, this paper presents here an impact factor \u03b2 that can improve its effectiveness: a model of the characteristic information of the learning group corresponding to the learning resource. Based on the characteristic information of the learning group corresponding to the learning resource, it is possible to understand the type of learning group corresponding to that type of learning resource. This can effectively reflect the general characteristics of the users learning the resource, so that the hybrid algorithm can make constant tuning recommendations. The evaluation formula of impact factor \u03b2:\n= ( , ) (1) 1 denotes the average of the multidimensional weight vector of the base\ninformation that the learner itself already has for measuring itself (which is not the same for each learner). ( , ) denotes the similarity between the two models, where x and y can be M1 or M2 (but not both) respectively, and its calculation method in this study takes the calculation of cosine similarity. That means ( , ) becomes larger, x and y are more and more similar with each other. Therefore, the role of the impact factor \u03b2 explored in this paper refers to the fact that the hybrid recommendation algorithm model merges the above two models (EIM+PIM) in the subsequent according to certain logical rules and mathematical operations. If the impact factor \u03b2 is smaller at this point, it indicates that the content of the generated recommendation results is more accurate. Then it is possible to make recommendations to user learners. On the contrary, it indicates that the content of the generated recommendation results is more deviant and does not conform to the general characteristics of the learning groups corresponding to such learning resources. Finally, it will present a more accurate personalized recommendation reference content generated by a hybrid recommendation system.\nThe overall framework of the hybrid recommendation system combines a contentbased recommendation algorithm and a KNN-based collaborative filtering algorithm. It uses the KNN algorithm in the beginning data preprocessing part and the final part of the recommended learning resources. After that it uses an LDA topic model interacting with a deep convolutional neural network CNN model for learning to analyze and classify the proposed recommended learning resources in an enhanced way. Finally, it combines the characteristic information models (impact factors) of the learning groups corresponding to the learning resources to recommend suitable learning resources to different learners.\nIn building the above existed information model and potential interest model, the\nTF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency representation) algorithm vectorization is needed to preprocess the original input data of the learner and calculate its feature weights. The purpose of data preprocessing is to optimize the model for the raw data at the input side to be more suitable for subsequent neural network processing.\n, = , \u00d7 log (2) In TF-IDF, for each indicator, , denotes the frequency of occurrence of this\nindicator among all Foreign language learners. N represents the total number of the\nsearch content set. And contains the number of samples in which the indicator has appeared. , log is recorded as the result to the feature vector weights of each learner.\nThe reinforcement classification learning model used in this study, implicit\nDirichlet distribution (hereafter abbreviated as LDA), is a topic model. It generates topics based on the word frequencies in a set of documents. I is essentially a three-layer\nBayesian structure They are document layer, topic layer and word layer. Usually, a topic\nmodel generally extracts several sets of keywords from a set of documents to express the core idea of its object, i.e., the \"topic\". LDA is a very effective method for finding an accurate and reasonable mixture of topics in a set of given documents. The neural network-based topic model used in this study mainly uses deep learning to reconstruct the text production process of the topic model. And it adds topic-word sparsity constraints to the modeling process to generate more expressive topic words.\nThe LDA algorithm adopted in this study is to first normalize the d-dimensional\ngiven learning resource dataset (d is the number of features), calculate the d-dimensional mean vector for each class. Then we calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix and the\ncorresponding eigenvectors by constructing the between class scatter matrix and the within class scatter matrix . Finally, the eigenvectors corresponding to this learning material will be subsequently used in the calculation of cosine similarity.\n= ! \u22ef ! #\u22ee \u22f1 \u22ee!# \u22ef !##&\n(between class scatter matrix ) = ' \u22ef ' #\u22ee \u22f1 \u22ee'# \u22ef '##& (within class scatter matrix )\nThe convolutional layer of a convolutional neural network CNN mainly consists of\ntwo basic operations, one of it is feature extraction and the other is feature mapping. In this study, we adopt the first feature extraction operation mentioned above. The aim is processing the relevant learning resources in the input layer. Finally, we combine the processed data with the LDA model to derive the corresponding knowledge point feature vectors.\nIn this study, we specify the input size of the convolutional neural network CNN as\n1. It corresponds to the channel dimension of the integer sequence input. Then the input is embedded using a feature vector embedding of dimension 8. For n element vectors to be spaced, layer blocks are created containing convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, ReLU layers, discard layers, and maximum pooling layers. For each block, we specify 100 convolution filters of size 1 \u00d7 N and a global maximum pooling layer. The input layers connect to each block and the concatenation layer concatenate the outputs of each block. Finally, we classify the output. It includes a fully connected layer with output size K, a Softmax parser layer, and a classification layer. And K is the number of classes. The ( , ) mentioned in the above analysis, indicates the similarity between two models. For the calculation of ( , ), the main methods are cosine similarity, Euclidean Algorithm and Pearson correlation coefficient. In this study, we adopt the method of calculating cosine similarity. Based on the collected user data, we use the TFIDF algorithm to vectorize the original input data of the learners for preprocessing and calculating as the input of * +* (or vectors a and b) for calculating the cosine similarity of the underlying information between learners.\n( , ) = cos( , ) = -. / \u00b7 0. 2 |-. /| \u00b7 |0. 2| (3)\nThen, we use LDA and CNN fusion analysis to derive the feature vectors of the\ncorresponding classified learning resources. And before, we used the hybrid recommendation algorithm model to merge the two models (EIM+PIM) according to certain logical rules and mathematical operations to obtain the learner vector. Then we use the cosine similarity again to calculate and define the threshold value of similarity \u03b3 to find the most similar learning resource recommendation set for each user. Finally, we use the impact factor \u03b2 to check and verify the accuracy of the recommended learning resources.\nAt the end of the AI-based hybrid recommendation algorithm for Foreign language\nlearning resources discussed in this paper is a KNN-based collaborative filtering algorithm. It has the same function as the data preprocessing part. Firstly, this paper's algorithm calculates and tests the Euclidean distance dist from sample points to all\nsample points, and then uses the hook theorem to calculate it. We set the parameter K and select the K points closest to the point to be measured. Then we count the number of each type or class label from these K points and select the class label number that appears most frequently as the class label number of the unknown sample. It can feedback the prediction results to recommend the learning resources that are most similar with the users' interactions with knowledge points to the recommended subjects. Finally, it generates a list of academic resource recommendations for each user."

Each learner sample has different information/behavioral characteristics about themselves. The Item ID of the learning resource represents the unique flag serial number of each learning resource.

The point where 1 is located at the line segment is the Item ID flag sequence number of the most recommended matching learning resource. According to the analysis of the results, the best learning resource path for a random sample is from learning resource 1 to learning resource 3 and finally to learning resource 2. It finally leads to the recommended personalized learning resource path generated by the hybrid recommendation algorithm system based on the learner's basic personal information.\nIn this study, we choose the model accuracy (MA) calculation to measure the\nmatching suitability of the recommendation results generated by each algorithmic model. The formula for calculating the model accuracy (MA) can be expressed as follows:\n3 = 4 5| 46 47| (4)\nIn this formula, N denotes the total number of recommended learning resources in general. 89 denotes the number of recommended learning resources accessed by learner users. 89: denotes the number of recommended learning resources not accessed by learner users.\nThis study selected the dataset from the learner information dataset of Kalboard 360.\nThe initial dataset consists of 480 learner records and 16 features.

This makes learning more enriching and oriented for the learner. It adds interest and practice to learning, slowly increases the difficulty curve of Foreign language learning, and increases learners' enthusiasm for learning. At the same time, this deep learning framework-based learning resource recommendation system is based on the previous resource system, which is continuously updated and iterated on its own. With its polymorphism, inheritability, and expandability, it eventually forms a more accurate personalized resource recommendation to meet the diversified needs of different learners in a targeted manner.
