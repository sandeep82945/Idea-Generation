On the other side, the measurement of the Weinberg mixing angle in the electroweak theory determines that the couplings associated to the SU(2) and U(1) symmetries were already distinct in its symmetric phase, before the electroweak breaking. This picture is consistent as we understand that such couplings evolve independently with the energy scale, meeting a common point together with the strong interaction coupling at the GUT scale. From a BRST symmetry point of view, this implies that each independent coupling should be associated to independent cocycles defined on a cohomological basis. The problem is that, before the GUT symmetry breaking, the BRSToperator associated to this symmetric phase predicts a single Yang-Mills coupling. This sets the question of what should be the BRST operator of the asymmetric phase, that would allow for the splitting of this coupling but at the same time, remain compatible with the BRST operator of the symmetric phase. In this work, we proceed to answer this question.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.105.125007\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe advent of a grand unified theory (GUT) is the attempt to actually comprehend the standard model (SM) SU\u00f03\u00de \u00d7 SU\u00f02\u00de \u00d7U\u00f01\u00de physics inside a tied description of these basic interactions. The goal would be to reproduce all the SM richness from a theory with the smaller possible set of free parameters, bringing economy and a higher predictability to such a new physics. Some of its consequences are controversial, and, for example, the predicted decay of the proton present on the original model proposals [1] and [2,3] is still under broad debate in the literature (see, for instance, the review [4] or more recently, [5,6]). On the other side, these models establish in a simple way the connection of the electric charges of quarks and leptons. And mainly, the project of unification is supported by the experimental evidence that the strong, weak, and electric couplings tend\nto converge on a common value at a high energy scale MG (in fact, this was the primary theoretical intention for the model design [7]). In this aspect, it is never excessive to remember that the electroweak theory is not a complete unification of the electric and weak interactions, as their couplings remain distinct even in the symmetric phase. This is also experimentally confirmed by the measurement of the Weinberg angle. Then, any GUT is ultimately a theory for the unification of all couplings, a theory with one single coupling. Our low energy physics would appear after a phase transition at the GUT scaleMG by a Higgs mechanism, and since then, the basic couplings evolved independently. This is understood as an effect of the decoupling of the heavy gauge modes, which acquire masses proportional to MG at the new Higgs vacuum. This means that each one of these couplings follow an independent renormalization equation. At this moment, we make a brief interruption to state that the work that we will develop here is a rereading of the theoretical construction which is behind any GUT theory from the point of view of the BRST language. We think that this approach is most suitable, as the BRST charge should reflect the true invariance of the vacuum in each phase. Let us argue for this approach and how it can give us a new insight on this problem. Rephrasing our initial presentation, we would say that seeing from the standpoint of our low energy scale, it is the *rubensamaral@id.uff.br \u2020verlemes@gmail.com \u2021ozemar.ventura@cefet-rj.br \u00a7lcqvilar@gmail.com Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

We expect them to meet at a definite high energy scale. They would join together in a unique coupling, which in its turn would then follow its own unique renormalization equation from this scale on. The SM group structure must then be accommodated within a simple Lie group. Now, from the perspective of the BRST analysis, this unique coupling is naturally predicted as a consequence of this character of the Lie group of the symmetric phase being simple. We can briefly summarize this line of reasoning and its impacts. In a first approximation, we can recover the concept of hidden symmetry, in contrast to a broken symmetry, originally exposed by Coleman [8]. For this intent, it is sufficient just to shift the scalar field by its vacuum expectation value (vev), not only in the action, but also in the BRSToperator of the symmetric phase. This will be the operator that will sign the transition from the symmetric to the broken phase. We will show that the immediate effect of this shift is to characterize the so acquired gauge mass in the usual cohomological BRST sense. Other consequences will be the trivialization of all cocycles containing any of the non differentiated would be Goldstones, as they now form BRST doublets with the nondifferentiated ghosts along the broken directions. This means that the physical Hilbert space do not depend on such fields (for this and other results in BRST cohomology, we refer to [9]). The same will happen with certain combinations of the gauge fields associated to the broken generators and the derivated would be Goldstones, as they now belong to BRST doublets with the derivatives of the same ghosts. As before, such combinations of fields will not belong to the physical space also. Comparing this result with a pure massless Yang-Mills theory, it is well known that in this case the BRST analysis leads to the physical independence on the nondifferentiated gauge fields, and observables only depend on the fields curvatures [9]. Now, in the Higgs broken phase, this exclusion along the broken directions happens only in this specific combination. Consequently, we will show that, in the broken phase, the massive broken gauge fields will appear in nontrivial BRST cocycles through the linear independent combinations with the would be Goldstones. In fact, this is responsible for the appearance of the Higgs gauge mass among the physical observables in the broken phase. And also, this makes explicit what is the true physical variable in the broken gauge directions, which is nothing more than the well-known statement that the would be Goldstones now represent the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the massive gauge fields in the broken Higgs phase. Then, from this BRST point of view, we are extending to the quantum level the classical observation that one can rotate the whole theory by a gauge transformation taking as gauge parameters the would be Goldstones (see, for instance, Ref. [10]). These scalar degrees of freedom disappear\naltogether from the theory as they are incorporated as the longitudinal massive gauge degrees. We are now at this point where we have an understanding of the Higgs gauge mass, but we still lack the independence of the gauge couplings after symmetry breaking. We will show that this is so because the BRST operator that we extended by including the vev of the scalar field still predicts one single gauge coupling for the whole theory. There is only one possible nontrivial element of the cohomology of this operator depending exclusively on the curvature, i.e., TrF2, and it is still based on the gauge field curvature of the symmetric phase. In this way, independent running gauge couplings after the phase transition are still not explained. Our proposal to approach this question is basically to reinterpret the quantization of the theory for the new Higgs vacuum. In this phase, as we have seen, the would be Goldstone fields (and their derivatives) do not play any physical role, as it happens with the ghosts (and derivatives) of the broken directions. So we proceed with the complete elimination of these fields from the theory, which can be understood as a choice of gauge, actually, the unitary gauge [10]. This will take us to a new BRST operator of the broken phase. This operator is nilpotent and can be used to characterize a new cohomology for this phase. After showing that in this way, we arrive at independent couplings for each independent symmetry of the new vacuum, we hope that this operator can guide us to the concept of observable after the symmetry breaking. In the next section, we will fix the notations and review some basic results of the BRST cohomology of massless Yang-Mills theory for completeness. In Sec. III, we will show how we can characterize the emergence of the gauge field mass as a product of the change of the BRST operator driven by the vev of the scalar field. Also we will analyze the physical status of the would be Goldstone and of the broken ghost fields in view of this transition BRST operator. Here, we will spend a few words on the \u2019t Hooft gauge, responsible for simultaneously showing the renormalizability and unitarity of the theory, which is in fact the great advance of the Higgs mechanism for the introduction of masses for gauge fields. Then, in Sec. IV, we exhibit a nilpotent operator for the unitary quantization of the broken phase. We will study its cohomology at the level of the action, paying special attention to the non trivial elements depending exclusively on the gauge fields. This cohomology will present an independent running coupling for each remaining symmetry of the vacuum. The origin of each counterterm will be traced back to elements of the BRST cohomology of the symmetric phase. This will demand that each independent running coefficient will have the necessary boundary condition of matching the associated value coming from the symmetric phase at the scale of the phase transition. This is the BRST derivation of the different gauge couplings matching at the GUT scale MG. At this\n125007-2\npoint, we will also show that the necessity of the \u2019t Hooft gauge demands now the addition of a second independent symmetry, which will shape the full nilpotent BRST symmetry at the broken phase. This will fix the coefficients of the counterterm action. Finally, this development opens the possibility to incorporate a new physics, as new elements at the level of the action are allowed after the phase transition, elements that are associated to the symmetric phase cohomology in higher dimensions. The possible interpretation of such elements as condensate candidates will be commented in our Conclusions."

Before entering in the details of this process, we now briefly review how the cohomology of the nilpotent operator s can be calculated [9]. These concepts will be sufficient to explore the broken phase. We begin by making a filtration in s,\ns \u00bc s0 \u00fe s1; s2 \u00bc \u00f0s0\u00de2 \u00fe fs0; s1g \u00fe \u00f0s1\u00de2; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere s0 acts linearly on the fields,\ns0AA\u03bc \u00bc \u2212\u2202\u03bccA; s0cA \u00bc 0; s0\u03c6A \u00bc 0: \u00f04\u00de\nThe nilpotency of s0 is easily confirmed from eq. (4). It establishes that the gauge field AA\u03bc and the derivative of the ghost \u2202\u03bccA form what is called a s0 doublet. A doublet \u00f0u; v\u00de of a nilpotent operator \u0394 happens when\n\u0394u \u00bc v; \u0394v \u00bc 0; \u00f05\u00de\nand neither u nor v enter in any other field transformation of \u0394. Notice that, from (4), the symmetrized derivative \u2202\u00f0\u03bcAA\u03bd\u00de also belongs to a s0 doublet, whereas \u2202\u00bd\u03bcAA\u03bd is in a singlet. This filtration is useful thanks to two basic theorems [9]. The first one states that the cohomology of s is isomorphic to a subspace of the cohomology of s0. The second says that the cohomology of any nilpotent operator does not depend on doublets. Then, we can conclude that a basis for the cohomology of s0 with any ghost number or dimension can be constructed from polynomials containing solely the nonderivated ghost, the scalar field and its derivatives, and/or the antisymmetrized gauge field derivative \u2202\u00bd\u03bcAA\u03bd . Expanding this basis with the quantum numbers of a fourdimensional Lagrangian, and then using the first theorem to complete these elements to obtain the full cohomology of s, we arrive at the standard action of counterterms of YangMills coupled to the scalar field. To each independent element on the cohomology of s, we associate a free coefficient. These coefficients are the physical parameters of the quantum action. From what we have just obtained, we can conclude that the only possible contribution to the counterterm Lagrangian made exclusively from gauge fields is TrF2. Then, the fact that polynomials constructed with the nonderivated gauge field AA\u03bc are excluded from the physical space means that a gauge mass would be forbid as an observable even if an invariant cocycle could be built from them. As we know, one way to allow for gauge masses is to implement a symmetry breaking mechanism. In the following, we will show how this mechanism circumvents this forbiddance from the BRST point of view."

We also have the directions that do not commute with z, the so-called broken directions, which we designate by lowercase letters from the beginning of the alphabet, as a,b,c... At this point, we specify the algebraic result of the broken theory by saying that we allow the structure constants of this phase to have only the following possible non-null contributions:\nfzab; fijk; fiab: \u00f07\u00de\nThis may not be the most general possibility, but it is sufficient for our purposes (this follows the Cartan decomposition of a Lie algebra for a symmetric space when fabc vanishes [10]). For example, the breaking of SU\u00f05\u00de into SU\u00f03\u00de \u00d7 SU\u00f02\u00de \u00d7 SU\u00f01\u00de, the original Georgi-Glashow model [1], follows this pattern. Then, at the moment of the breaking, the BRST transformation of the scalar field in (2) must now take into account the vev h\u03c6zi \u00bc \u03bc, becoming the transition operator sv,\nsv\u03c7A \u00bc \u03bcgfABzcB \u00fe gfABCcB\u03c7C; \u00f08\u00de\nand from the list of available structure constants in (7), we get that only the scalar fields in the broken directions feel the presence of the vev,\nsv\u03c7a \u00bc \u03bcgfabzcb\u00fe gfabi\u00f0cb\u03c7i\u2212 ci\u03c7b\u00de\u00fe gfabz\u00f0cb\u03c7z\u2212 cz\u03c7b\u00de: \u00f09\u00de\nIn the other directions, the scalar fields transformations remain unchanged,\nsv\u03c7i \u00bc gfijkcj\u03c7k \u00fe gfiabca\u03c7b; sv\u03c7z \u00bc gfzabca\u03c7 b: \u00f010\u00de\nHere, it is important to highlight that the operator sv is in fact a symmetry of the whole action after the symmetry breaking, being understood that for the other fields sv acts as s in (2),\nsvAA\u03bc \u00bc \u2212\u00f0\u2202\u03bccA \u00fe gfABCAB\u03bccC\u00de \u00bc \u2212\u00f0D\u03bcc\u00deA; svcA \u00bc\ng 2 fABCcBcC: \u00f011\u00de\nThis can be seen as an explicit realization of the Coleman\u2019s \u201chidden symmetry\u201d description of a broken symmetry [8]. But the change for this hidden symmetry sv obviously has physical consequences.\nThe novelty comes from the shift now present in the transformation (9). It has the power to completely change the cohomology. In order to understand this, we can filter sv as in (3), and obtain s0v,\ns0vAA\u03bc \u00bc \u2212\u2202\u03bccA; s0vcA \u00bc 0; s0v\u03c7i \u00bc 0; s0v\u03c7z \u00bc 0; s0v\u03c7a \u00bc \u03bcgfabzcb: \u00f012\u00de\nFrom (12), we immediately see that the scalars \u03c7a are now in doublets with the ghosts ca arranged in linearly independent combinations with coefficients given by the fabz (here, we are implicitly supposing that the matrix Mab \u00bc fabz does not have zero modes). Besides this, we can see that the combination \u03bcgfabzAb\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc\u03c7a belongs to a doublet with \u03bcgfabz\u2202\u03bccb. At the same time, the linearly independent combination \u03bcgfabzAb\u03bc \u00fe \u2202\u03bc\u03c7a is a singlet,\ns0v\u00f0\u03bcgfabzAb\u03bc \u00fe \u2202\u03bc\u03c7a\u00de \u00bc 0: \u00f013\u00de\nThen, using the cohomological doublets theorem stated in the last section, the basis for the cohomology of s0v, limited in four dimensions, is expanded by polynomials constructed from this combination presented in (13), the curvatures \u2202\u00bd\u03bcAA\u03bd , and the scalars, ghosts, and their derivatives still belonging to s0v singlets, in particular all the fields \u03c7i and \u03c7z (and derivatives), and the nonderivated ghosts ci and cz. The presence of the element in (13) in the cohomology opens the possibility of the existence of monomials of dimension two in the action with bilinears in the Aa. This just means that these vectorial bosons that enter the singlets in (13) acquire masses after the symmetry breaking. At the same time, we interpret the scalars \u03c7a whose derivatives appear in (13) as the would be Goldstone bosons. As they themselves belong to doublets, we understand that none physical observable will depend on them on the broken phase. It is not difficult to show that (13) can be completed to the cohomology of the full operator sv,\nVA\u03bc \u00bc \u03bcgfAbzAb\u03bc \u00fe \u00f0D\u03bc\u03c7\u00deA; \u00f014\u00de\ntransforming covariantly as\nsvVA\u03bc \u00bc gfABCcBVC\u03bc : \u00f015\u00de\nThis kind of relation was called a \u201cRussian-like formula\u201d in [11], after its functional similarity with the Russian formula (see Ref. [9] and references therein). Basically, it represents\n125007-4\na mapping of the cohomology of a filtered operator to the cohomology of the full nilpotent operator. In our present case, this relation will enable us to concentrate our efforts of the cohomology analysis in the next sections to the sector built exclusively with gauge fields.

The first term in (16) is the massive contribution just mentioned, and the second contains the well-known nonphysical coupling of the massive gauge fields and the would be Goldstones. Here, it is important to dwell on the analysis of this point. As we have shown, the fact that each would be Goldstone becomes a nonphysical representation follows essentially from their transition BRST transformations (9). Actually, this resembles the same problem of the Yang-Mills action in the symmetric phase, with the explicit presence of a longitudinal mode of the gauge field which does not represent a physical degree of freedom. This is solved by the existence of the BRST symmetry itself, which enables a gauge fixing procedure to eliminate this mode. From another point of view, the invariance under a gauge symmetry implies that not all mathematically possible gauge connections are physically distinguishable, and again the question of a gauge fixing is central. Then, on the one hand, a gauge fixing is demanded by the gauge symmetry, on the other it is allowed by the BRST symmetry. The Faddev-Popov mechanism follows from these principles. Alternatively, the mechanism for the case of a spontaneous symmetry breaking was designed by \u2019t Hooft [12,13]. Its importance relies not only on the elimination of the nonphysical couplings shown in (16), but also for a limit where renormalizability becomes explicit, depending only on the choice of a gauge parameter. This ensures unitarity and renormalizabilty at the same time. This is essential for the theoretical framework of the Higgs mechanism. And it is the existence of the BRST symmetry that states that the choice of any specific value of the gauge parameter is physically irrelevant (physical observables do not depend on this choice [9]). We can compare with the situation of a Yang-Mills theory with a mass term. In this case, as the gauge symmetry is explicitly broken, we loose the BRST symmetry altogether. This implies that it is not possible to implement a gauge fixing, and this theory is inevitably power-counting nonrenormalizable (there is an elucidative argument in [14] on this point). Coming back to the nonphysical coupling in (16), we can introduce the term proposed by \u2019t Hooft,\nGA \u00bc \u2202\u03bcAA\u03bc \u00fe \u03b1\u03bcgfAzb\u03c7b; \u00f017\u00de\ntogether with a sv doublet composed of an antighost qA and a Lagrange multiplier bA transforming as\nsvqA \u00bc bA; svbA \u00bc 0: \u00f018\u00de\nThe \u2019t Hooft gauge fixing can now be written as a transition BRST trivial cocycle,\nSgf \u00bc sv Z d4x\u00f02qAGA \u2212 \u03b1qAbA\u00de; \u00f019\u00de\nwhere \u03b1 is the gauge parameter just mentioned. When we integrate out the multiplier bA, the spurious nonphysical element in (16) is eliminated. And it is the triviality of (19), possible by the existence of the transition BRST sv as a symmetry of the action, that is behind the independence of the physics on \u03b1. An adequate choice of the gauge parameter then makes the massive propagator compatible with power counting renormalizability. Once physics is independent on this choice, the theory is renormalizable in any gauge. So in (16), we understood how a phase transition can change the cohomology. New elements can appear in the broken phase, which were not even BRST symmetric in the previous phase. However, this still cannot be the complete description. As we said, all this development pursuits the construction of a GUT, with the evidence that the single coupling of the symmetric phase must split into the independent couplings of the basic interactions at our energy scale. The problem is that following the standard calculation, the cohomology of sv in the sector made exclusively of gauge fields is identical to the cohomology of s; i.e., there is still only one cocycle, the same FA\u03bc\u03bdFA\u03bc\u03bd, and then only one possible coupling. The question is how we can modify or reinterpret the cohomology after the symmetry breaking scale in a way compatible with this transition between both regimes. This is the issue for the next section."

            "text": "NEW VACUUM\nWe begin this section remembering that from (12), we concluded that the ghosts ca and the scalars \u03c7a belong to the trivial sector of the theory after the symmetry breaking, as it happens to all ghost derivatives. Actually, the would be Goldstones only appear in the combination given in (14), as part of the massive gauge field, the longitudinal component. This is in agreement with the classical argument that these Goldstones can be rotated away, being completely eliminated from the theory. This is equivalent to a gauge choice, the unitary gauge [15]. Then, from this point on, we will restrict our analysis to the sector built exclusively by the original gauge field AA\u03bc [soon, when we limit our cohomology study to the level of the 4D counterterm\n125007-5\naction, we will understand that wherever Aa\u03bc appears nonderivated it must be completed in the sense of the Russianlike formula (14)]. The gauge freedom associated to the symmetries of the new vacuum, due to the non-null fijk, can be shown to be preserved in this process, and need to be gauge fixed [15]. And although the gauge components Aa\u03bc are now massive, a gauge fixing is still needed along these directions, as the discussion on \u2019t Hooft gauge of the last section specified. This means that we cannot eliminate the ghosts ca altogether, but we can isolate them from the BRST machinery in the first approach. In addition, we still have the necessary link with the theory at the breaking point determined by the transition BRST sv. Then, joining all these considerations, the BRST quantization for the broken phase can start from the filtration of the fields ca from Eqs. (11) (see Ref. [9] for details on this mathematical step). Noticing the allowed structures constants (7) for the symmetric phase, the new BRST operator sq becomes\nsqA i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc \u00bc \u2212\u2202\u03bcci\u00f0N\u00de \u2212 gNfijk\u00f0N\u00deAj\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc ck\u00f0N\u00de;\nsqAz\u03bc \u00bc \u2212\u2202\u03bccz; sqAa\u03bc \u00bc \u2212 X N gNfabi\u00f0N\u00deAb\u03bcci\u00f0N\u00de \u2212 g0fabzAb\u03bccz;\nsq\u03c7i\u00f0N\u00de \u00bc gNfijk\u00f0N\u00decj\u00f0N\u00de\u03c7k\u00f0N\u00de; sq\u03c7z \u00bc 0; sq\u03c7a \u00bc \u2212\nX N gNfabi\u00f0N\u00de\u03c7bci\u00f0N\u00de \u2212 g0fabz\u03c7bcz;\nsqci\u00f0N\u00de \u00bc 1 2 gNfijk\u00f0N\u00decj\u00f0N\u00deck\u00f0N\u00de;\nsqcz \u00bc 0; sqca \u00bc X N gNfabi\u00f0N\u00decbci\u00f0N\u00de \u00fe g0fabzcbcz: \u00f020\u00de\nThe main point now that one can check is that the set of transformations (20) define a nilpotent sq operator in all the fields of the theory indeed. This is fundamental in order to view this set as a BRST system. In Eq. (20), we finally needed to specify the N possible different subgroups of the original gauge group that remain as symmetries of the new vacuum. Then, Ai\u00f0N\u00de means the i component of the gauge field associated to the subgroup N. Independence of each subgroup means that the structure constant fijk\u00f0N\u00de is only nonvanishing if all its indices belong to the same subgroup N, so that if Ti\u00f0N\u00de is a generator associated to one of these subgroups, then\n\u00bdTi\u00f0N\u00de; Tj\u00f0M\u00de \u00bc i\u03b4\u00f0N\u00de\u00f0M\u00defijk\u00f0N\u00deTk\u00f0N\u00de: \u00f021\u00de\nThe label N in fabi\u00f0N\u00de entering the sq transformation of Aa\u03bc in (20) means that the index i belongs to the subgroup N.\nSummation over this label N will always be explicitly indicated; otherwise, it is not intended. This happens, for example, in the transformation of Ai\u00f0N\u00de in (20), where no summation on N occurs. Finally, we call attention to the distinct couplings gN introduced for each subgroup and the coupling g0 associated to the Abelian subgroup along the symmetry breaking direction z. The imposition that the system (20) must match that formed by (9), (10), and (11) imply that all these couplings gN and g0 must satisfy the boundary condition of matching g, the coupling in the symmetric phase, at the GUT symmetry breaking scale,\ngN\u00f0MG\u00de \u00bc g0\u00f0MG\u00de \u00bc g\u00f0MG\u00de: \u00f022\u00de\nObviously, the equivalence among the couplings cannot be preserved at our energy scale. This indicates that they must evolve independently after the GUT phase transition, which means that each one must be renormalized following its own renormalization equation [10]. In the BRST quantization procedure, this implies that each coupling must be associated to an independent nontrivial cocycle in the cohomology of the BRST operator at this phase, which is again the problem that we were facing at the end of the last section. But now, the BRST sq for the broken phase gives us the answer. In fact, it is immediate to confirm that the cohomology with the quantum numbers of the fourdimensional action calculated from the BRST transformations (20) has independent contributions of the form,\nFi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc\u03bd Fi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc\u03bd; \u00f023\u00de\nwhere\nFi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc \u2202\u03bcAi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bdAi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc \u00fe gNfijk\u00f0N\u00deAj\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc Ak\u00f0N\u00de\u03bd : \u00f024\u00de\nWe will also have the nontrivial cocycle,\nFz\u03bc\u03bdFz\u03bc\u03bd; \u00f025\u00de\nwith\nFz\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc \u2202\u03bcAz\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bdAz\u03bc; \u00f026\u00de\nassociated to an independent Abelian coupling g0. This set of contributions (23) and (25) indicates independent beta functions to each coupling of the independent subgroups that remain as symmetries of the vacuum after the phase transition. Once we have obtained the cohomological independence of the physical couplings, we must stress that up to this point this has just served us as a guideline to develop the correct BRST system adequate to the experience at our energy scale. From this point on, we will explore some\n125007-6\npossible new physics that may be achieved by the study of the system (20). In this work, we will concentrate on the rest of the cohomology at the level of the action built exclusively from the vector fields. All terms in this sector which are independent of the massive Aa\u03bc are described by (23) and (25). In the broken directions, we may see some\nchanges. If we apply the same filtration done in Eq. (4) to the operator sq, it indicates that Aa\u03bc becomes a singlet of this filtered operator. In order to expand its cohomology upon this sector, we must include any object built with Aa\u03bc and its derivatives. The most general polynomial in this sector with the quantum numbers of the action is\n\u03a3 \u00bc Z d4x\na1\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd \u00fe a2\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd\u2202\u03bdAa\u03bc \u00fe aab3 Aa\u03bcAb\u03bc \u00fe a4\u00f0Aa\u03bcAa\u03bc\u00de2 \u00fe a5Aa\u03bcAa\u03bdAb\u03bcAb\u03bd\n\u00fe X N a\u00f0N\u00de6 f abi\u00f0N\u00deAa\u03bcAb\u03bdfcdi\u00f0N\u00deAc\u03bcAd\u03bd \u00fe a7fzabAa\u03bcAb\u03bdfzcdAc\u03bcAd\u03bd \u00fe X N a\u00f0N\u00de8 F i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc\u03bd fabi\u00f0N\u00deAa\u03bcAb\u03bd\n\u00fe a9Fz\u03bc\u03bdfzabAa\u03bcAb\u03bd \u00feDabcdAa\u03bcAb\u03bcAc\u03bdAd\u03bd ; \u00f027\u00de\nwhere by Dabcd we mean all possible independent symmetric elements with four indices in the gauge algebra. For example, depending on the GUT group, even the quartic symmetric symbol dabcd obtained from the fully symmetric trace of four generators is allowed (see Ref. [16] for details on this symbol). They will also depend on the representation used, and their detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this work. Anyway, we will give an example of what we mean by independence of these terms in the end of this section. We will soon discuss each element written in (27) and search for their completion in the cohomology of the full sq. First, we notice the presence of the massive contribution with coefficient a3. It is a nontrivial contribution of the cohomology of sq, but as previously emphasized, it should be understood as part of the invariant cocycle (16). On the\nother hand, the elements with coefficients a4, a5, and Dabcd, also immediately invariant under sq, cannot be understood as coming from elements already present at the original action of the symmetric phase. When we come to the definition of the counterterm action, this aspect will just be responsible for their exclusion, but at this point, their presence means the possibility of a new physics as long as the sq operator can be associated to an effective symmetry of the vacuum at a low energy scale. We will have more to say about this later in this section and in the Conclusions. So, let us complete the other elements in (27) to obtain the cohomology of sq. This problem can be seen from the point of view of a consistent deformation [17]. We will show in details an example of this process. We can begin with the first element by calculating its variation under sq,\nsq Z d4x\u00f0\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd\u00de \u00bc \u2212 Z d4x 2 X N gN\u2202\u03bc\u00f0fabi\u00f0N\u00deAb\u03bdci\u00f0N\u00de\u00de\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd \u00fe 2g0\u2202\u03bc\u00f0fabzAb\u03bd\u00decz\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd : \u00f028\u00de\nThe element of first order in the couplings whose sq transformation can compensate these in (28) is\n\u2212 Z d4x X N gNfabi\u00f0N\u00deA i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc Ab\u03bd\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd \u00fe g0fabzAz\u03bcAb\u03bd\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd :\n\u00f029\u00de\nIn its turn, the sq variation of this element gives a second order contribution in the couplings, which can be compensated by the introduction of the following second order element:\nZ d4x X N X M gNgMfabi\u00f0N\u00defacj\u00f0M\u00deA i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc A j\u00f0M\u00de \u03bc Ab\u03bdAc\u03bd\n\u00fe 2 X N gNg0fabi\u00f0N\u00defaczA i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc Az\u03bcAb\u03bdAc\u03bd\n\u00fe \u00f0g0\u00de2fazbfazcAz\u03bcAz\u03bcAb\u03bdAc\u03bd : \u00f030\u00de\nIf we join together the first element in (27) with those in (29) and (30), we can see the formation of a covariant derivative, \u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00dea\u00bc\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd\u2212 X N gNfabi\u00f0N\u00deA i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc Ab\u03bd\u2212g0fabzAz\u03bcAb\u03bd ; \u00f031\u00de\n125007-7\nwhere covariance here means that it transforms as the Aa\u03bc field under sq as shown in (20)\nsq\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00dea \u00bc \u2212 X N gNfabi\u00f0N\u00de\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00debci\u00f0N\u00de\n\u2212 g0fabz\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00debcz: \u00f032\u00de Then, the nontrivial cocycle in the cohomology of sq constructed from the element a1 in (27) assumes the simple form,\na1 Z d4x\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00dea\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00dea: \u00f033\u00de\nEquations (31) and (33) indicate that Aa\u03bc is in fact a vectorial matter field in the broken phase. Notice, however, that it is not in any representation of the invariant groups of the new\nvacuum. As we can see in (20), its transformation uses the structure constants of the symmetric phase in the broken directions, which appear again in the definition of the covariant derivative (31). This seems to be related to a necessity of recovering the full theory in the symmetric phase. Let us show how this may happen. Before the GUT symmetry breaking, we had the contribution in the Yang-Mills action, Z d4x\u00f0Fa\u03bc\u03bdFa\u03bc\u03bd\u00de\u00bc Z d4x\u00f0\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd \u2212\u2202\u03bdAa\u03bc\u00fegfaBCAB\u03bcAC\u03bd \u00de\n\u00d7\u00f0\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd\u2212\u2202\u03bdAa\u03bc\u00fegfaDEAD\u03bcAE\u03bd\u00de: \u00f034\u00de\nNotice that in the right-hand side of (34) we are only adding on the broken directions of the Yang-Mills curvature, this is not the full Yang-Mills action yet. If we substitute the possible structure constants (7) after the symmetry breaking, we get\nZ d4x\u00f0Fa\u03bc\u03bdFa\u03bc\u03bd\u00de\u00bc Z d4x \u2202\u03bcAa\u03bd \u2212\u2202\u03bdAa\u03bc\u2212 X N gNfabi\u00f0N\u00deA i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc Ab\u03bd\u00fe X N gNfabi\u00f0N\u00deAb\u03bcA i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bd \u2212g0fabzAz\u03bcAb\u03bd\u00feg0fabzAb\u03bcAz\u03bd 2 : \u00f035\u00de\nFinally, after (31), it is immediate to see that Z d4x\u00f0Fa\u03bc\u03bdFa\u03bc\u03bd\u00de\u00bc Z d4x\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u2212\u2207\u03bdA\u03bc\u00dea\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u2212\u2207\u03bdA\u03bc\u00dea:\n\u00f036\u00de\nWe identify the origin of the cocycle (33) as part of the Yang-Mills action before the GUT symmetry breaking. The observation is that at this point of the analysis of the broken phase, we now have independent coefficients for each contraction, as can be understood from (27) and (33), Z d4x\u00f0a1\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00dea\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00dea \u00fe a2\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00dea\u00f0\u2207\u03bdA\u03bc\u00dea\u00de: \u00f037\u00de\nLet us continue now with the other elements of (27). In order to study the elements a7 and a9, we define FA\u00bcz\u03bc\u03bd as the component z of FA\u03bc\u03bd,\nFA\u00bcz\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc \u2202\u03bcAz\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bdAz\u03bc \u00fe gfzabAa\u03bcAb\u03bd : \u00f038\u00de\nSince\nsFA\u00bcz\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc \u2212gfzabFa\u03bc\u03bdcb; \u00f039\u00de\nit implies\nsqFA\u00bcz\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc 0; \u00f040\u00de\nand then it is obvious that\nsq\u00f0\u2202\u03bcAz\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bdAz\u03bc\u00de \u00bc 0 \u21d2 sq\u00f0fzabAa\u03bcAb\u03bd\u00de \u00bc 0: \u00f041\u00de\nFrom the last inference in (41), we see that the terms a7 and a9 of (27) are already invariant under sq. For the last elements in (27), and following the same reasoning as before, we see that\nsqF A\u00bci\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc\u03bd \u00bc gNfijk\u00f0N\u00decj\u00f0N\u00deFA\u00bck\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc\u03bd ; \u00f042\u00de\nwith\nFA\u00bci\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc \u2202\u03bcAi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bd \u2212\u2202\u03bdAi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc \u00fegNfijk\u00f0N\u00deAj\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc Ak\u00f0N\u00de\u03bd \u00fegNfabi\u00f0N\u00deAa\u03bcAb\u03bd \u00bcFi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc\u03bd \u00fegNfabi\u00f0N\u00deAa\u03bcAb\u03bd ; \u00f043\u00de\nwhere we used the definition (23) for Fi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc\u03bd . From (20), we know that\nsqF i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc\u03bd \u00bc gNfijk\u00f0N\u00decj\u00f0N\u00deFk\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc\u03bd : \u00f044\u00de\nThen, substituting (43) and (44) in (42), we arrive at the covariant transformation that we were searching\nsq\u00f0fabi\u00f0N\u00deAa\u03bcAb\u03bd\u00de \u00bc gNfijk\u00f0N\u00decj\u00f0N\u00de\u00f0fabk\u00f0N\u00deAa\u03bcAb\u03bd\u00de: \u00f045\u00de\nFrom this, one easily obtain the invariance of the last elements a6 and a8 under sq. This finishes the proof that each coefficient in (27) is associated to an invariant nontrivial cocycle of sq.\n125007-8\nMore than that, we see that if we join the terms a6, a7, a8, and a9 of (27), together with the elements (23), (25), and (37) that we have already proved to be in the cohomology of sq, we recover the full structure of the original YangMills term FA\u03bc\u03bdFA\u03bc\u03bd of the symmetric phase. What this is in fact proving to us is that the effect of the symmetry breaking is to split the original cocycles of the symmetric\nphase into independent invariant nontrivial pieces after the breaking. Gathering together the nontrivial contributions (23), (25), and (37), the already invariant elements a3 to a9 and Dabcd from (27), we display the cohomology of sq at the broken phase in the sector of the gauge fields,\n\u03a3c \u00bc Z d4x a0Fz\u03bc\u03bdFz\u03bc\u03bd \u00fe X N aNF i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc\u03bd Fi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc\u03bd \u00fe a1\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00dea\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00dea \u00fe a2\u00f0\u2207\u03bcA\u03bd\u00dea\u00f0\u2207\u03bdA\u03bc\u00dea \u00fe aab3 Aa\u03bcAb\u03bc\n\u00fe a4\u00f0Aa\u03bcAa\u03bc\u00de2 \u00fe a5Aa\u03bcAa\u03bdAb\u03bcAb\u03bd \u00fe X N a\u00f0N\u00de6 f abi\u00f0N\u00deAa\u03bcAb\u03bdfcdi\u00f0N\u00deAc\u03bcAd\u03bd \u00fe a7fzabAa\u03bcAb\u03bdfzcdAc\u03bcAd\u03bd \u00fe X N a\u00f0N\u00de8 F i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc\u03bd fabi\u00f0N\u00deAa\u03bcAb\u03bd \u00fe a9Fz\u03bc\u03bdfzabAa\u03bcAb\u03bd \u00feDabcdAa\u03bcAb\u03bcAc\u03bdAd\u03bd : \u00f046\u00de\nThen we see from (46) that sq leaves several free coefficients. Actually, this is not a desired feature. Following the BRST quantization procedure, for each of these independent coefficients, we would associate a physical observable of the broken phase. For example, independent elements as a1 and a2 do not seem reasonable. The clue to the missing piece is to recover a point mentioned in the beginning of this section: a gauge fixing is still needed along the broken directions. This means that we need a propagation for the ghost ca, as can be obtained from the expression (19) for the \u2019t Hooft gauge fixing. The problem that we face now is that once the operator becomes sq instead of sv in (19); we loose this propagator. This signs to us that sq cannot be the whole BRST operator of the vacuum after the symmetry breaking. Something must be missing and sq should be completed with extra terms. Here, we call this missing piece as the operator \u03b4, and comparing the sq operator of (20) with the sv of (11); we guess that \u03b4 in general can be written as\n\u03b4Ai\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc \u00bc\u2212XNfiab\u00f0N\u00deAa\u03bccb; \u03b4Az\u03bc\u00bc\u2212XzfzabAa\u03bccb; \u03b4Aa\u03bc\u00bc\u2212\nX N YNfaib\u00f0N\u00deA i\u00f0N\u00de \u03bc cb\u2212YzfazbAz\u03bccb\u2212\u2202\u03bcca;\n\u03b4\u03c7i\u00f0N\u00de \u00bc\u2212LNfiab\u00f0N\u00de\u03c7acb; \u03b4\u03c7z\u00bc\u2212Lzfzab\u03c7acb; \u03b4\u03c7a\u00bc\u2212\nX N KNfaib\u00f0N\u00de\u03c7i\u00f0N\u00decb\u2212Kzfazb\u03c7zcb\u2212Mz\u03bcfabzcb;\n\u03b4ci\u00f0N\u00de \u00bc1 2 BNfiab\u00f0N\u00decacb;\n\u03b4cz\u00bc1 2 Bzfzabcacb; \u03b4ca\u00bc0: \u00f047\u00de\nThe coefficients XN , Xz, YN , Yz, LN , Lz, KN , Kz, Mz, BN , and Bz are fixed by demanding that the full operator sq \u00fe \u03b4 be nilpotent on all the set of fields of the theory. This constraint has a solution for these coefficients as\nXN \u00bc BN \u00bc 1 YN \u00bc 1 gN ;\nXz \u00bc Bz \u00bc 1 Yz \u00bc 1 g0 ;\nLN:KN \u00bc Lz:Kz \u00bc \u2212Mz \u00bc 1: \u00f048\u00de\nThis allows us to interpret sq \u00fe \u03b4 as the adequate BRST operator for the theory after the phase transition. Although an interesting point to be observed is that the dependence on the inverse of the non-Abelian couplings gN suggests that \u03b4 would loose its relevance on lower energy scales, where the theory would be dominated by the sq part of the BRST symmetry. Once we obtain \u03b4, we must impose it as a symmetry of the action (46). Finally, the free coefficients of (46) are fixed as\naN \u00bc g2N 4 ;\na0 \u00bc g 02\n4 ;\na1 \u00bc \u2212a2 \u00bc a\u00f0N\u00de6 \u00bc 2a7 \u00bc 1\n2 ;\na\u00f0N\u00de8 \u00bc gN 2 ;\naab3 \u00bc fdazfdbz;\na9 \u00bc g0\n2 : \u00f049\u00de\n125007-9\nHere, we must highlight a fundamental point that brings mathematical consistency to this result. The sq operator is easily seen as a zero eigenvalue filtration on the ghost ca of the full sq \u00fe \u03b4 nilpotent operator, equivalent to the filtration shown in (3), with sq playing the role of s0 and \u03b4 playing the role of s1 in that equation. Then, by the fundamental theorem of cohomology already mentioned [9], the cohomology of sq \u00fe \u03b4 is isomorphic to a subspace of the cohomology of sq. This means that the independent elements of (46) after imposing \u03b4 as a symmetry are in fact independent cocycles of the cohomology of the full BRST operator sq \u00fe \u03b4. Their coefficients are then interpreted as independent observables of the theory. Finally, from (49), we are allowed to conclude that the couplings gN and g0 are independent observables of the broken phase. In the list (49), we omitted the coefficients a4, a5, and Dabcd. As we mentioned in the beginning of this section, the invariance under \u03b4 imposes that wherever Aa\u03bc appears nonderivated it must be completed in the sense of the Russian-like formula (14). Then, if we limit the counterterm cohomology to the maximum uv dimension of four, the contributions associated to a4, a5, and Dabcd are excluded as these elements demand extra terms extrapolating this boundary in order to be \u03b4 invariant. In this way,\nthey cannot contribute to the counterterm action. But we guess that once we are in a lower energy regime, possibly beyond a confining scale, these elements can origin contributions to condensates, together with all the independent elements of the cohomology of sq present in (46). Now we can address the question for the gauge fixing after the symmetry breaking. The BRST definition (19) for the \u2019t Hooft gauge is implemented by using the vacuum operator for this phase, Sgf\u00bc\u00f0sq\u00fe\u03b4\u00de Z d4x\u00f02qAGA\u00fe\u03b1Qqaba\u00fe\u03b1NqiNbiN\u00fe\u03b10qzbz\u00de:\n\u00f050\u00de\nHere, the GA, previously given in (51), are rewritten as\nGi\u00f0N\u00de \u00bc \u2202\u03bcAi\u00f0N\u00de\u03bc Gz \u00bc \u2202\u03bcAz\u03bc Ga \u00bc \u2202\u03bcAa\u03bc \u00fe \u03b1Q\u03bcfazb\u03c7b: \u00f051\u00de\nWith independent gauge parameters for each sub-group, \u03b1N , \u03b1z, and \u03b1Q, the gauge fixing term turns out to be\nSgf \u00bc Z d4x 2bi\u2202\u03bcAi\u03bc\u00fe 2qiN \u2202 2ci\u00fe gNfijk\u2202\u03bc Aj\u03bcck\n\u00fe 1 gN fiab\u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bccb\n\u00fe 2bz\u2202\u03bcAz\u03bc\u00fe 2qz \u2202 2cz\u00fe 1\ng0 fzab\u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bccb\n\u00fe 2ba\u00f0\u2202\u03bcAa\u03bc\u00fe\u03b1Q\u03bcfazb\u03c7b\u00de\u00fe 2qa\u00bd\u22022ca\u00fe gNfiab\u2202\u03bc Ab\u03bcci \u00fe g0fzab\u2202\u03bc\u00f0Ab\u03bccz\u00de\u00fe gNfaib\u2202\u03bc Ai\u03bccb \u00fe g0fazb\u2202\u03bc Az\u03bccb\n\u00fe\u03b1Q\u03bcgNfazbfbcj\u00f0\u03c7ccj\u00de\u00fe\u03b1Q\u03bcg0fazbfbcz\u00f0\u03c7ccz\u00de\u00fe\u03b1Q\u03bcgNfazbfbjc\u00f0\u03c7jcc\u00de\u00fe\u03b1Q\u03bcg0fazbfbzc\u00f0\u03c7zcc\u00de\u2212\u03b1Q\u03bc2fazbfbczcc\n\u00fe\u03b1Qbaba\u00fe\u03b10bzbz\u00fe\u03b1Nbibi : \u00f052\u00de\nAs promised, closing this section, we will present an explicit calculation on the symmetric symbols Dabcd appearing in (46). Let us take a toy model with a GUT based on a SU\u00f03\u00de group. The scalar fields are in the adjoint representation, but for convenience, we expand them on the Gell-Mann basis of generators of the su\u00f03\u00de algebra in a fundamental representation [18] (this kind of expansion, in fact, is used in one of the Higgs bosons of the minimal SU\u00f05\u00de GUT, for example). We can break the symmetry along the z \u00bc 8 direction, leaving a SU\u00f02\u00de \u00d7 U\u00f01\u00de symmetry of the vacuum. In our notation, the indices i will be associated to the first three generators expanding the su\u00f02\u00de subalgebra, and the a will represent the remaining four broken directions. In this particular model, one can show that a possible symmetric contribution may be expanded in the tensors of the algebra,\ndiabAa\u03bcAb\u03bddicdAc\u03bcAd\u03bd\n\u00bc 1 4 \u00f0\u00f0Aa\u03bcAa\u03bc\u00de2 \u2212 4 3 \u00f0f8abAa\u03bcAb\u03bdf8cdAc\u03bcAd\u03bd\u00de\u00de: \u00f053\u00de\nThis relation can be demonstrated from an identity specific for the su\u00f03\u00de case [16],which is possible by the cancellation of the totally symmetric dabcd for su\u00f0N < 4\u00de. Our argument is just to stress that the elementsDabcd need to be studied in each case, and in this present simple example, they can be discarded as, from (53); they can be written in terms of elements already present at (46)."

            "text": "The action (46) with (49) displays the different couplings associated to each group that remains an invariance of the vacuum after the phase transition. As we have shown, they\n125007-10\nare associated to independent nontrivial cocycles of the broken phase BRST operator sq \u00fe \u03b4. Then, following the standard BRST quantization procedure, these couplings now develop in an independent way with their own renormalization equations in this phase. It is important to recall that they are tied by the boundary condition (22), i.e., that they all must converge to the value of the original coupling g at the GUT phase transition scale MG. Another feature of the solution (46) with (49) for the cohomology problem is that all couplings can be reabsorbed under independent redefinitions of the gauge fields. Physically, this associates the independence of each coupling to the acquired independent renormalization of these fields belonging to the different symmetry groups labeled\nby N that remain as symmetries of the vacuum after the phase transition. Finally, the presence of the contributions with coefficients a4, a5, and Dabcd in (46) must be emphasized as these objects are not originated from any element already present at the action before the symmetry breaking. They may be interpreted as contributions coming from elements of superior uv dimension of the symmetric phase. They may become relevant in a confined low energy regime, together with all the independent elements present in (46). This seems to be a novelty associated to a phase transition process, that can be helpful in the definition of new observables of a broken phase, as condensates, for example.\n[1] H. Georgi and S. L.
