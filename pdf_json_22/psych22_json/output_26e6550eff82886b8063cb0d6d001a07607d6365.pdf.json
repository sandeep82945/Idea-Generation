    "abstractText": "Background: According to the World Drug Report, cocaine is the second most used drug globally after cannabis. Online discussion forums enable the understanding of authentic drug users\u2019 experience as it is anonymous. Therefore, this study determined the uses, effects and toxicity of cocaine from the perspectives\u2019 of e-psychonauts. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using six popular discussion forums. From these discussion forums, 1229 posts from 50 threads were subject to thematic analysis. Hence, the information from these threads were examined carefully for patterns and codes among the data. The codes were then collated into subthemes and themes. Results: The four main themes emerging from the study were related to cocaine characteristics and use, e-psychonauts\u2019 knowledge and experience, desired effects and adverse events. The main characteristic associated with cocaine use was purity that was highest in the US being nearest to the source. The most common cutting agent encountered in cocaine samples was levamisole that increased the chances of immunosuppression and cardiovascular toxicity. Purity depended on the source of purchase that included street dealers, dark web and surface web. Hence, e-psychonauts recommended purchase of cocaine from known dealers rather than websites with unknown sources. E-psychonauts mainly used cocaine in social context and parties or to self-medicate against anxiety and depression. Effects desired from cocaine use were mainly euphoria and increased energy. However, tachycardia and myocardial infarction were the main adverse events. It is noteworthy to mention that myocardial infarction was idiosyncratic and was often lethal. Myocardial infarction was more often reported when cocaine was combined with alcohol due to the production of cocaethylene. Social harm was also reported as a consequence for the use of cocaine that resulted in homelessness and broken relationships. Conclusion: Online discussion forums allowed the understanding of e-psychonauts\u2019 experience with cocaine use. Not only it informed about the sources and modalities of use of cocaine but also about the adverse events and social harm associated with cocaine use. The present findings serve as useful information for practitioners and healthcare professionals dealing with cocaine users.",

            "text": "Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using six popular discussion forums. From these discussion forums, 1229 posts from 50 threads were subject to thematic analysis. Hence, the information from these threads were examined carefully for patterns and codes among the data. The codes were then collated into subthemes and themes.\nResults: The four main themes emerging from the study were related to cocaine characteristics and use, e-psychonauts\u2019 knowledge and experience, desired effects and adverse events. The main characteristic associated with cocaine use was purity that was highest in the US being nearest to the source. The most common cutting agent encountered in cocaine samples was levamisole that increased the chances of immunosuppression and cardiovascular toxicity. Purity depended on the source of purchase that included street dealers, dark web and surface web. Hence, e-psychonauts recommended purchase of cocaine from known dealers rather than websites with unknown sources. E-psychonauts mainly used cocaine in social context and parties or to self-medicate against anxiety and depression. Effects desired from cocaine use were mainly euphoria and increased energy. However, tachycardia and myocardial infarction were the main adverse events. It is noteworthy to mention that myocardial infarction was idiosyncratic and was often lethal. Myocardial infarction was more often reported when cocaine was combined with alcohol due to the production of cocaethylene. Social harm was also reported as a consequence for the use of cocaine that resulted in homelessness and broken relationships.\nConclusion: Online discussion forums allowed the understanding of e-psychonauts\u2019 experience with cocaine use. Not only it informed about the sources and modalities of use of cocaine but also about the adverse events and social harm associated with cocaine use. The present findings serve as useful information for practitioners and healthcare professionals dealing with cocaine users.\nKeywords: Cocaine, e-psychonauts, Online discussion forums, Adverse events, Myocardial infarction, Thematic content analysis\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "According to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) World Drug Report (2021), cocaine is the second most used drug worldwide after cannabis [1]. The latter report stated that in 2019, 20 million people used cocaine and that corresponded to about 0.4% of the global population [1]. The latter figure rose by 24% in only 10 years-time where cocaine overdose cases had\n*Correspondence: s.assi@ljmu.ac.uk\n1 Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, James Parson Tower, Byrom Street, Liverpool L3 3AF, UK Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nincreased from 3822 in 1999 to 15,883 in 2019 [2, 3]. This latter figure did not decrease with the Covid-19 pandemic that in turns contributed to increase in drug use worldwide. In this respect, increase in cocaine-related seizures was seen worldwide and increase in shipment sizes was\u00a0featured [4\u20136]. Cocaine is seen as a moderately accepted drugs in comparison to cannabis and heroine [7]; where cannabis is seen as safe and heroine is seen as highly toxic drug [7].\nThe impact of cocaine use/abuse results in adverse drug events (ADEs) and lethal effects where it is the most frequently encountered drug in drug-related deaths [8]. ADEs linked to cocaine use were reported for multiple organs including nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, kidneys and liver [9, 10]. Nonetheless, the majority of reported research related to effects/toxicity of cocaine included pharmacological/toxicological studies [11, 12] with limited studies analysing perspectives and experiences of users/abusers [13, 14]. The latter four\u00a0studies explored the culture and context of cocaine use with limited information on experience of users in terms of specific effects. This is partly due to drug use (cocaine in this case) is a sensitive topic and subjects users to \u2018blame\u2019 and \u2018judgement\u2019 when discussing it. Online discussion forums serve as a popular platform for drug users (including e-psychonauts) to share their experiences, thoughts and views in a blame free environment [15, 16]. Thus, posting on online discussion forums is anonymous where it does not require users to share their username, age, gender, location and/or identifiable information. Particularly in cases of illicit drugs such as cocaine, drug use on online discussion forums could be discussed without fear of repercussions [17, 18].\nPrevious drug-related research has utilised online discussion forums\u2019 to explore users\u2019 perspectives towards new psychoactive substances (NPS) [19\u201321]. However, none of the aforementioned studies explored cocaine use and the only study regarding cocaine use from web-based information did not involve online discussion forums [22]. Subsequently, it was important to study cocaine use from online discussion forums especially that cocaine use has increased since the COVID-19 epidemic started where people\u2019s mental health and psychiatric well-being deteriorated [23, 24].\nTherefore, this study aimed at understanding the uses, effects and toxicity of cocaine from the perspectives of e-psychonauts via online discussion forums. Subsequently this study complemented the previous studies by providing in-depth insight into cocaine use considering its sourcing, different trends in use within diverse context, effects sought and toxicity experienced. By analysing online discussion forums, this study was able to provide authentic experience that had been expressed by users\u2019 in\na blame free environment. Furthermore, in-depth qualitative analysis enabled to understand whether early users endorse the use of cocaine or discourage it."

Initial forums inspection yielded 7959 threads of which 50 threads (containing 1229 posts) were found relevant. Inclusion criteria comprised threads that outlined experiences, characteristics, motivations and effects surrounding cocaine use.

In this sense, each thread was read line-by-line thoroughly where relevant sections were highlighted and codes were assigned accordingly. No limit was placed on the amount of text that could be coded in one code where the text could range from a single word to a whole paragraph. Quotes were grammatically corrected without impairing the integrity and subject of the quote so the quotes could be read easily. Some quotes also were coded numerous times if different information were provided in the same quote. Then the codes were read and re-read and collated into subthemes that encompassed four overarching themes related to: cocaine characteristics, users\u2019 knowledge and experience, desired effects and ADE. Figure\u00a02 shows the coding procedure. The threads that had already been coded were re-read for comments relating to the overarching themes in order to ensure nothing have been previously missed.

Highest purity was around 70% and was reported in South American countries being Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. This was followed by Florida that was close to the aforementioned countries. Purity of cocaine encountered in Europe was in the range of 30\u201360%. 30% purity was seen in the UK whereas 60% for Belgium, France and Netherlands (60%). E-psychonauts checked for purity by either checking the melting point of cocaine or sending it for testing. Moreover, e-psychonauts associated lower grade cocaine with lower levels of euphoria and higher levels of ADEs\u00a0being: anxiety, nose irritation, bleeding and paranoia. The aforementioned ADEs\u00a0 were attributed to cutting agents used. Hence, increased stimulation, anxiety and paranoia was related to cocaine cut with Adderall, amfetamine, methamfetamine, aspirin, caffeine and/or methamfetamine. Methamfetamine/cocaine combination was further reported as highly addictive. Moreover, increased numbness was observed when cocaine was cut by benzocaine, lidocaine, procaine and/ or cathinones. Cocaine cut by levamisole caused immunosuppressant effects, nasal infection and cardiovascular damage. Lethal effects were stated regarding cocaine cut\nN number, NR not reported"

Of the aforementioned mentioned impurities, levamisole was the most frequent reported cutting agent:\n\u2018Levamisole has increasingly been used as a cutting agent in cocaine sold around the globe with the highest incidence being in the USA. In 2008\u20132009, levamisole was found in 69% of cocaine samples seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) (QN167).\u2019\nThough users cited statistics decade ago, other users reports levamisole still the main cutting agent in recent years. For instance, one user reported:\n\u2018It\u2019s something like 90% of coke has levamisole in it\u2026 Not really any sort of test serves as purity, especially with levamisole being cut into the vast these days (QN165 and QN168).\u2019\nAdditional cutting agents reported were baking soda, gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), ephedrine, hexedrone, lactose, milk powder and Ritalin.\nRegarding purchase sources and pricing, sources included the dark web and surface web sources as well as street dealers. Price was only reported by few years and was witnessed as increasing by two folds over the last 2 years in the US and the UK. Where reported, the price for cocaine was between \u00a340\u201360 (per 1 g) in the UK and $80 (per 1 g) in the US.\nRoute of administration of cocaine included mainly snorting followed by chewing, IV injection parachuting and smoking. Snorting of cocaine was done on its own or alongside consumption of alcohol\nsynchronously or intermittently. Effects after snorting were reported as long-lasting for days and potentially resulting in overdosing. Effects attained from snorting comprised numbness in nose/sore throat and euphoria. Nevertheless, snorting was associated with nasal bleeding, severe dehydration, high blood pressure, cardiac damage, and damage to nose and face. Where damage occurred to nose and face, IV was the second sought route for cocaine intake. IV was described as the fastest route (100% bioavailability) but extremely dangerous causing dehydration, violent seizures, involuntary muscle movement and death. Smoking (crack) through roll ups, pipes or inhalers was the least favourite route due to its short half-life and association with chronic hallucinations. Cocaine was also orally administered; however, oral route was slower route with long lasting effects when compared to other routes of administration. Oral routes involved drinking cocaine in drinks, parachuting cocaine and/ or chewing coca leaves.\nDrugs alternative to cocaine encountered included amfetamines, cathinones, methylene dioxide methamfetamine (MDMA), methyl phenidate and n-ethyl pentedrone. Reasons behind choice of the aforementioned drugs included price, stimulant effects and duration of effects. One user reported:\n\u2018Cocaine is both highly euphoric and, to a degree, subtle. If you have been doing cathinones ( for example) you may be expecting a twice-strong half-fun experience\u2019. (QN203).\nTable 3 Themes, subthemes and example quotations extracted in the study"

So, it\u2019s not that better coke has a better crash, it\u2019s just that bad coke is often cut with substances that have a nastier crash than cocaine, and so bad coke often has a worse crash than good coke.\nPurity of cocaine is betterat source and varies between geographical locations (n = 11) I still get really good girl. I can do five shots out of a 20 bag good enough to give me the train. But I\u2019m also in Florida, closer to the source, and in a port city so that might explain it.\nImpure cocaine affects ADEs and quality of come down (n = 21) I agree that lesser quality coke gives you a harder comedown.\nApproaches to check purity (n = 4) If you have a lot and want to test it the movie *** actually gives you a very accurate way to do so by putting it on a hot plate and gage what temperature it melts out.\nPurchase of cocaine (n = 14) Dark web sources (n = 4) Shared a gram of absolute bash with a mate at the start of the week, simply because he brought it round.

It took a very long time to learn to control my usage to the point that I could hold down a job.\nSnorting (n = 42) Cocaine really is amazing if you do it responsibly. I experimented by snorting a few and completed a report paper I was cramming on for my class at the university.

I never cared for stimulants (I prefer opiates/opioids), but if I did, I\u2019d choose amfetamines over coke.

Soon after meeting with a fellow user to drink some beer and do some lines, a friend called suggesting we drop acid (LSD). At this point the cocaine high was already in effect, and as cocaine typically does, it had become my first priority. I felt somewhat uneasy about the notion of dropping acid (LSD) due to the longevity of its effects, but I found that once a tab was offered to me in person, I popped it right in my mouth with little to no consideration. This weakening of inhibition and conscious consideration is a direct effect of the \u201ceverything is alright\u201d euphoric rush of cocaine.\nUse of cocaine and heroin (n = 3) Alright I got out of prison last week and decided to get high over the weekend. Things got really out of control and by Saturday I had a ball of coke, a gram of heroin, and a fresh 10-pack of syringes. I pretty much mainlined like 2.5\u20133 g of coke over the course of 34 h. At about one in the morning I shot a small shot of heroin like 15 min after my last shot of coke.\nUse of cocaine and MDMA (n = 1) The first time I sniffed up coke was when I was at a huge house party, already rolling on MDMA and drinking. Back in 2013ish and I had a blast. Though I do not recommend this combo of drugs.\nUse of cocaine and Psycadelics (n = 2) Eating mushrooms while high on cocaine took on a similar but unique, and ultimately more pleasant dimension.

Social anxiety: gone. Seemed to last all night (I was drinking, too, didn\u2019t know as much about drugs as I do now) and didn\u2019t notice a at all.

I experimented by snorting a few \u2018and completed a report paper I was cramming on for my class at the university. I got and it was due to the \u2018enhanced\u2019 focus I had while doing the homework.\nEuphoria (n = 25) The first time I did coke I was already addicted to speed. I did a couple of lines I felt a rush and euphoria. At first used on weekend but eventually went to using everyday went from Adderall to coke then crack .\nIncreased Confidence (n = 2) As much of a dark past me and Coke have had, I must say that there is nothing quit first bump. You will feel unbelievable. Confidence through the roof and having a bett you ever thought possible.\nIncreased energy (n = 5) I had plenty of energy, had a noticeable smile on my face and felt a irresistible urge to fight someone.\nIncreased sociability (n = 5) Luckily their friend there with me to talk to since cocaine makes you sociable lol. On an off week, snort real lines and have so much fun at clubs, casinos and strip clubs.\nIncreased talkability (n = 2) I felt invincible and I could talk and talk and talk, which was great because I was kind of shy.\nIncreased self-confidence (n = 1) Cocaine also doesn\u2019t keep you up partying for days, months, etc. - it\u2019s nothing like amfetamine (Speed) and doesn\u2019t energise you in that way. It (Cocaine) just raises your self-esteem and makes you feel about ten feet tall.\nTable 3 (continued)"

Not only will you be able feel your anxiety but others around you will be able to tell your paranoia due to visible signs of agitation and your eyeballs sticking out of your head.\nThis then seems to trigger the psychosomatic part where I feel side effects of anxiety and paranoia kick in afterwards. Although my tongue may be swollen, I can still calm myself down in that state to recognise that I am still breathing air in and out through my nose, and even through my mouth.\nDehydration (n = 4) Cocaine is very dehydrating so you need to drink a lot of fluids\nDepression (n = 6) Still feeling very depressed, and feeling pressure in my head, and head pulsating. I really hope this goes away soon.\nHeadache (n = 9) I get just as bad of a headache from doing poor quality cocaine as I do from lack of sleep. Usually though I can trace my \u201clack of sleep\u201d headache back to being dehydrated and hungry.\nNausea (n = 4) After about an hour of consuming coke like this my nose is completely clogged and I become very nauseous.\nNumbness (n = 17) As soon as I snorted my face went all numb and I got a decent little rush.

This can lead to arrhythmias, or an irregular heartbeat.\nAtherosclerosis-related coronary artery disease (n = 1) In fact, 28% of people who died suddenly after cocaine use showed severe atherosclerosis-related coronary artery disease.\nCardiotoxicity (n = 7) Is cocaine cardiotoxic? Yup. Can we say for certain what dose/frequency causes it? No. Some people can have horrible reactions from as little as 20\u201350 mg of cocaine, others can go through 3 g or more.\nChest pain (n = 1) It doesn\u2019t sound surprising to me to feel nauseous and chest pain with high dose stimulants where if you lucky will contain probably at least levamisole as adulterants and maybe some others***.\nDamaged blood vessels (n = 1) It has something to do with what\u2019s in cocaine specifically that stresses out the heart in a unique way that Adderall and Ritalin do not. Something to do with the vessels in the heart. People who abuse cocaine often have heart issues, while those who even do meth (methamfetamine) don\u2019t often succumb to the same symptoms or at least not as noticeable.\nIncreased blood pressure (n = 2) Lots of possible causes; higher blood pressure, restricted blood flow, not to mention the acidic powder you\u2019ve been firing up into your sinus cavities.\nMyocardial infarction (n = 15) Cocaine-induced heart attacks are not just a risk for individuals who\u2019ve used the drug for years.

Sometimes otherwise healthy people (usually men in their 30s\u201340s) will literally have their heart stop when they least expect it, and just like that, it\u2019s all over. It\u2019s not common enough to stop everyone from using cocaine, obviously, but it happens with enough frequency that it deserves a mention. At least it\u2019s a fairly painless exit, with no period of anticipation/fear, I suppose. (\u201cHe died doing what he loved... snorting cocaine off **** while blasting **** music...\u201d)\nTachycardia (n = 16) After this, he didn\u2019t experience anything, no rush, no euphoria, nothing except fast heart beat. My heart went crazy beating and then slows down, and I can feel it stops beating for 4\u20135 s, and then goes fast again, and it was just having irregular heart beat.\nVasoconstriction (n = 4) Vasoconstriction isn\u2019t the only issue with cocaine. Cocaine can interfere with your heart\u2019s electrical system\nEndocarditis (n = 1) I won\u2019t go into all the tiny details, but fast forward 6 months. I get an infected abscess, endocarditis, heart surgery, pacemaker.\nLethal (n = 10) Lethal (n = 10) Overdose, which can cause seizures, cardiac arrest and death are most directly related to the cocaine serum level in the blood, as well as the general and cardiac health of the user.\nEar, nasal and throat damage (n = 24) Nasal bleeding (n = 1) I personally find no benefit of snorting cocaine hydrochloride. The most I have ever had was a nose bleed from snorting a rather large rail.\nNasal damage (n = 18) Further down the line, cocaine abuse can damage your nose/septum, feelings that you associate with pleasure, i.e. sex, nice food etc., can end up being felt only through taking cocaine.\nNasal infection (n = 1) Doing coke gives you some risk of a nasal infection, but doing really levamisole cut coke makes that chance extremely higher!\nTooth decay (n = 3) Crack cocaine will cause several acute issues in the body, namely rapid tooth decay, tachycardia, and lung irritation (as any smoke will cause).\nSocial harm (n = 17) Broken relationship (n = 4) It (cocaine) wont hurt yourself but it will hurt your family and friends, this is what you really should think about.

This is similar to the action of acetaminophen and alcohol producing a much more toxic combination than the two individually. Benzos (benzodiazepines) will not lessen the creation of this compound.\nCocaine-amfetamine (n = 4) It (cocaine) can be cut with active ingredients such as amfetamines, which will too contribute to making the comedown worse.\nCocaine-Aspirin (n = 1) While aspirin is frequently recommended to decrease the likelihood of heart attack or stroke, this is because it is a blood thinner and decreases the occurrence of blood clots.\nCocaine-benzodiazepines (n = 2) However benzos (benzodiazepines) and coke (cocaine) can of course be a problematic combo as well, you may take more cocaine than usual due to less side effects (thanks to benzos).\nCocaine-Fentanyl (n = 2) I can\u2019t comment on quality as I\u2019ve been sober through all of this, but I personally know/knew two people who decided to do some blow one evening a month ago (snorted) and both OD\u2019ed. (fentanyl) - one of them passed away.\nCocaine-GBL (n = 1) Also GBL (gamma butyrolactone) is used a lot to give poor quality Coke a bit of a minor euphoria, because they can only use a minor amount of GBL or you would pass out - often making you a bit dizzy.\nPolydrug use encompassed the use of cocaine alongside other drugs such as: heroin, marijuana, alcohol, stimulants and benzodiazepines. Polydrug use were sought to alter the effects of cocaine where the interaction could to increased or decreased stimulant effects. Cocaine-heroin combination (crack and smack) was taken in order to achieve more intense and longer lasting effects that using cocaine alone. Where stated, users mixed around 2.5\u20133 g of cocaine with around 1 g of heroin over the course of 24 h yet described the effects as \u2018out of control\u2019, \u2018hitting the nail on the head\u2019 and/or \u2018trouble\u2019.\nMarijuana-cocaine combination were taken either by smoking the combination when using primo cigarettes that comprised cocaine-laced marijuana cigarettes, or by smoking marijuana cigarettes alongside snorting cocaine lines. The combinations was reported as bringing \u2018strong body high vibes\u2019, \u2018instant alertness\u2019 and \u2018increased alertness\u2019. However, the combination was described at other instances as \u2018disappointing that the users felt no euphoria\u2019. When combined with alcohol, users\u2019 reported \u2018heavily elevated high\u2019 feeling, \u2018high vibes\u2019 and increased surge to drink. This could be attributed to the cocaethylene that in turns resulted in many unwanted effects related to the inhibitory effects of alcohol. Negative effects experienced related to cocaethylene were cardiovascular toxicity (unspecified), increased risk of overdose and increased risk of sudden death.

But my experience with MPH and cocaine (insufflated) is they both feel kinda the same especially the side effects.\nCocaine-Opiates (n = 1) Cocaine and an opiate mixed together is more likely to be fatal, due to cardiac arrhythmia or delayed opiate overdose due to lower perceived effect, than either substance on it\u2019s own.\nCocaine-Procaine (n = 2) Cocaine itself actually numbs your nostrils. In fact one of the things people used to use as \u201ccut\u201d was powdered novocaine (procaine), which tricked people into thinking it was \u201creal\u201d cocaine because of the numbing sensation they got from it.

The duration of action reported for cocaethylene was 144 min compared to 60 min for benzylecgonine.\nUsers sought using cocaine with stimulants in order to achieve increased energy boost. Yet, cocaine-stimulants interaction resulted in nervousness, increased heart rate and paranoia. Specifically when taken with amfetamine and MDMA, users\u2019 experienced worse come down in terms of anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia and nervousness. Anxiety resulting from cocaineamfetamine combination was attributed to increased thoughts among users and increased their liability to overdose. Users described themselves as \u2018close to death\u2019 during panic attached.\nThe aforementioned effects were especially encountered during come down and did not get resolved even if depressants (such as benzodiazepines) were taken during come down. For instance cocaine-benzodiazepine interaction resulted in increased risk of OD and addiction to benzodiazepines. Yet some users still recommended to take alprazolam (Xanax) 0.5 mg half-way through the trip."

Other reasons for using cocaine encompassed influence by educational colleagues, drug tourism, self-medication and/or as alternative to other drugs. In this context, cocaine provided relaxation, antidepressant effects, relief from cluster headaches and occipital neuralgia. Cocaine was preferred to alcohol, cannabis, ecstasy, methamfetamine and methylphenidate due to increased duration of action and decreased toxicity. E-psychonauts recommended limiting cocaine use to special occasions:\n\u2018If at all possible, I would just try and limit your use to special occasions or maybe just be a weekend warrior (even that is quite taxing on the body/mind\u2019 (QN305).\nE-psychonauts also self-medicated with cocaine or with other drugs in order to avoid cocaine ADEs and/or comedown. Self-medication with cocaine was pursued in order\nto achieve anaesthesia, control depression, social anxiety and insecurity. However, these effects were described as short term:\n\u2018Cocaine will fix some common problems such as boredom, depression, social anxiety, etc\u2026 But only in the very short-term, it\u2019s not a very functional stimulant either since it lasts so little\u2019.

Euphoric levels were related to purity of cocaine and it was found to be followed by feelings of anxiety and physical discomfort.\nIn social scenarios, cocaine increased confidence and increased ability to talk. Increased sociability and confidence lasted 30\u201340 min after snorting and enhanced focus enabled the completion of tasks but was dose dependant.\nIn order to overcome depression, users took cocaine to achieve a calming effect and escape reality and real-world problems however, e-psychonauts knew that cocaine did not fully solve their problems:\n\u2018Cocaine will fix some common problems such as boredom, depression, social anxiety, etc\u2026 But only\nin the very short-term, it\u2019s not a very functional stimulant either since it lasts so little\u2019 (QN341).\nSexual arousal was also reported among users who experienced increased arousal and desire for intercourse.

Addiction was the most prevalent ADE and was described as difficult to hide, life ruining and leads to social harm:\n\u2018It happens when someone takes too much of it. For many, this is a daunting task because it can be very addictive. The rush that people get from cocaine causes them to repeatedly take it. This is how the addiction to cocaine is formed. Sadly, an addiction to cocaine is scary because it can very much damage a person\u2019s life. The high from the cocaine causes the user to not worry about it because they feel great at that moment. Cocaine is truly a dangerous drug\u2019. (QN553).\nMoreover, withdrawal symptoms lasted around a month and were restlessness, irritability and anxiety.\nAnxiety was mainly experienced during night-time where users had dry mouth, clenched teeth, nausea, vomiting and difficulty breathing. Anxiety attacks were experienced within the first two lines of cocaine and increased proneness to overdose. For some users overdosing exacerbated the effects of anxiety attacks with experiences described as \u2018close to death\u2019. Panic attacks were reported alongside anxiety and in some instances were seen at a rate of one per day and led to hospitalisation. Paranoia was also experienced with anxiety when moderate to high doses of cocaine were used and was characterised by shaking, sweating and increased heart rate. Paranoia was found to be experienced outside of the home and in places where the user felt less comfortable. In some situations, paranoia caused users to hear noises outside or felt like they were being followed by the police or neighbours which led them becoming irritable.

Online discussion forums allowed e-psychonauts to openly discuss sensitive issues such as drug use without worrying about legal or emotional repercussions [39]. Previous studies of online discussion forums explored other drugs such as cathinones and cannabinoids [19\u2013 21] or solely investigated the uses of cocaine without highlighting experienced ADEs\u00a0 [22].\nSubsequently, the present study complemented previous studies by highlighting the users\u2019 authentic experiences not only of desired effects but also of ADEs and reasons for using cocaine. This is crucial particularly for healthcare professionals and governmental organisations in any harm reduction approach and control of drug use. Four overarching themes were established within the study relating to cocaine characteristics and use, users\u2019 knowledge and experience, desired effects and ADEs.\nHence in this study most users were of male sex\u00a0with median age of 33-years-old. Previous literature has also found disparity between\u00a0both sexes with increased usage of cocaine among males [40, 41]. Moreover, young adults have been found to use the Internet opposed to older people [42].\nIn relation to cocaine use, purity was found to be highest in countries of origin (Columbia, Bolivia and Peru) and decreased in distance from the source from North America to Europe as supported in previous literature [43]. Within North America, due to ports and proximity to source, Florida was found to have cocaine of highest purity [44]. The main adulterant declared was levamisole which had been found in 69% of cocaine seized by DEA [45]. Whereas in the past, the majority levamisoleadulterated cocaine had been limited to USA, Europe has been witnessing increased levamisole-adulterated cocaine over the last ten years [46, 47] and has been reported across the US and Europe [48, 49].\nThe main administration of cocaine was snorting which was consistent with previous research [50]. Snorting cocaine is less prone to overdose compared to IV but resulted into nasal damage that in extreme cases needed surgical intervention [51\u201353].\nUsers were familiar with the ADEs related to nasal and IV damage yet they preferred cocaine especially in a social context [54]. Cocaine increased confidence and sociability explaining its prevalence in social scenarios as well as drug tourism [55\u201359]. However, its use in social context did not yield only positive emotions towards the drug. Hence, sentiment analysis showed both positive and negative emotions towards cocaine. The main negative emotions were attributed to fear and annoyance and the positive emotions included interest, enjoyment and relaxation [60, 61].\nThe negative emotions did not stop users taking cocaine that had increased euphoric effects compared with other drugs (e.g., amfetamine) due to actions on dopaminergic and serotoninergic receptors [62, 63]. Cocaine affinity to dopamine explained the increased sexual activity associated with cocaine. Cocaine was reported as the most effective drug to increase libido and sexual performance; however, increased usage was found to deteriorate these effects [55, 64, 65].\nCocaine ADEs outweighed its desired effects as stated by e-psychonauts and were mainly attributed to nervous (NS) and CV systems. Addiction was the most prevalent nervous system ADE and was corroborated by literature exploring addiction originating from the same systems that cause euphoria [62]. Anxiety, hallucinations, paranoia and psychosis were among other NS effects resulting\nfrom cocaine use [66\u201371]. In addition, tachycardia and MI were the main reported CV adverse events [72\u201375]. Tachycardia and MI can result by two mechanisms being: (a) indirect stimulation of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors (b) prevention of re-uptake of noradrenaline and dopamine in the pre-synaptic cleft [76\u201378]. It was noteworthy to mention were not dependant on the age group, biological sex and/or acute/chronic use. The lethal effect attributed to MI was idiosyncratic where its predictability and severity were not understood [79, 80]. The effects were described idiosyncratic due to their high variability among users/ abusers [80]. Hence, there were no indicators to identify people who may experience more life-threatening CV\u00a0 adverse events than others upon intake of cocaine [81]. Moreover, many cocaine CV\u00a0symptoms (e.g. arrhythmia) were underreported among users [80]. Sudden cardiac death was attributed to cocaine and was related to spontaneous coronary artery dissection [82].\nHowever, NS and CV were not the only effects experienced by users where other events included nasal damage, nasal bleeding and tooth decay. Cocaine causes progressive damage to the nose leading to ischaemic necrosis of septal cartilage and septum perforation [83]. Literature has addressed the link between illicit substances such as cocaine and tooth decay and found that tooth decay was more prevalent in cocaine abuse [84].\nCocaine-drug interactions reported included mainly cocaine-alcohol and cocaine-levamisole. Cocaine-alcohol interactions were highly cardiotoxic due to production of cocaethylene and caused tachycardia and violent behaviour [85]. Cocaine-levamisole interactions caused CV\u00a0toxicity, decreased white blood cells count, immunosuppression, increased risk of infection, leukaemia and neutropenia [86]. In all cases, cocaine-drug interactions were dependent on dose, route of administration and purity of the drug [87].\nNot only physical ADEs were associated with cocaine, but also social harm was reported. This included selfharm, career problems and homelessness that were reported by users, and the literature has found links correlating cocaine\u00a0to inward-aggression and self-harm [88, 89]."

            "text": "Using discussion forums had many strengths related to data collection where it allowed in-depth understanding of cocaine use from analysis of e-psychonauts\u2019 authentic experiences. The anonymity within the forums allowed participants to be more honest and open about their\nexperiences without the fear of repercussions from discussing illicit drug use/abuse.\nNonetheless, many limitations were encountered in the study. The first limitation was related to the low numbers of users that reported their sociodemographic information. This is partly related to the forums being anonymous and this makes it difficult to have exact estimate of the users reporting their sociodemography, as well as the completeness and authenticity of information. Nonetheless, discussion provide a rich source of data and indepth understanding of users\u2019 beliefs, views and experiences especially when analysed qualitatively and saturation of data is achieved. Missing information was found as a problem where data such as demography and dosage were often not reported by e-psychonauts which could have influenced results. Due to nature of the study and the anonymity within the forums it was also not possible to ask follow-up questions without breaching ethics regulations to access the missing information. There was also no method to authenticate the subjective experiences and only literature could be used opposed to biological testing (e.g., blood and hair)."

            "text": "This study found discussion forums offered a rich source of information and anonymity within the forums allowed e-psychonauts to provide honest experiences regarding cocaine use and effects. The findings of this study contributed to the scientific literature by building on present knowledge regarding cocaine purity, effects and ADEs. The most prevalent adulterants in cocaine were levamisole and procaine. Cocaine was most commonly snorted by users followed by IV administration. E-psychonauts mainly reported cocaine use in social situations due to its euphoric effects. However, cocaine was linked to many ADEs including, anxiety, paranoia, tachycardia, MI and sudden cardiac death syndrome. Moreover, it was associated with social harm that often resulted in broken relationships and homelessness.\nFor future research, accessing data from other social media sources (e.g., Twitter) or toxicological data can provide better understanding of cocaine on a wider platform and from different demographics. The application of machine learning algorithms will make predictions surrounding cocaine use and better understand reasons and effects associated with cocaine use. Biological testing could also be undertaken on participants to validate the subjective experiences given by e-psychonauts.\nAppendix\u00a01 Table\u00a04"

            "text": "6C45.2 Cocaine dependence Cocaine dependence is a disorder of regulation of cocaine use arising from repeated or continuous use of cocaine. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use cocaine, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use cocaine. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of cocaine, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of cocaine, or repeated use of cocaine or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if cocaine use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 1 month.\n6C45.6 Cocaine-induced psychotic disorder Cocaine-induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from cocaine. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychoticlike disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of Cocaine intoxication or Cocaine withdrawal. The amount and duration of cocaine use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the cocaine use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the cocaine use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with cocaine use).\n6C45.7 Certain specified cocaine-induced mental or behavioural disorders\nMB24.3 Anxiety Apprehensiveness or anticipation of future danger or misfortune accompanied by a feeling of worry, distress, or somatic symptoms of tension.
