            "text": "Our focus is the first CHIWORK annual meeting, which ran as a hybrid event June 8-9, 2022, in Durham, NH, USA. A total of 115 participants registered for the annual meeting, 27 for in-person attendance and 88 for online attendance. During the two days of the conference each of our sessions was attended by approximately 20-25 in-person participants, and 20-25 online participants. We received 30 full paper submissions of which 18 were accepted.\nThe meeting was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and so we prioritized safety. Our approach was to create a hybrid event, which allows participants the flexibility to attend CHIWORK in the way that suited their safety needs. We also instituted active safety measures at the meeting: we had daily, self-administered COVID tests, and we mandated N95 or KN95 masks for all. We also encouraged participants to eat outside, and to not eat indoors.\nFor supporting diversity and inclusivity, we again believed that a hybrid event was the right approach. This allows for a wide range of voices to be heard. The first questions we received when we announced the call-for-papers were: \u201cdo we have to travel to present?\u201d We would have lost many participants if we had mandated in-person presentations/attendance. This would have harmed the diversity of perspectives and depth of discussion during CHIWORK.\nWe recognized that inclusive and engaging hybrid experiences are difficult to create, and some might argue even impossible to achieve (cf. [3]). We had no doubt that the in-person and online experiences would not be the same. For in-person attendees, it would be possible to be present, to go to dinners, to chat in the hallways, and to hear applause. Online participants would miss these parts of the event. So, we dedicated much thought to how to integrate online and in-person participants. In the following we describe our design decisions."

            "heading": "1.1 Presentation format",
            "text": "We asked authors, both online and in-person, how they would like to present their work. They had two options: they could present their work with a standard slide presentation, or they could have a conversation about their paper with a session chair (Figure 1). For conversations, the session chair would share a file with the presenter outlining the timing of the conversation and providing several questions in advance. We asked presenters to outline their responses in the shared file. The questions and responses served as scaffolding for the presenter and session chair to engage in a lively discussion about the paper. It is this discussion that replaced the standard slide presentation and was intended to provide the basic information about the paper to the audience. After this planned part of the discussion, the session chair would turn to the audience for additional questions \u2013 just as they would do after a slide presentation.\nWe ended up with a variety of presentation formats: in-person conversations and slide shows, as well as remote conversations and slide shows. Adapting the presentation style to the desires of the authors made authors comfortable. At the same time, the\nvariety of presentation styles helped online and in-person participants focus on the content. Also, the variety of formats within each session made the session feel more dynamic and less monotonous than webinar or online presentation sessions."

            "text": "We wanted to make the hybrid experience relatable to both online and in-person participants. For this reason, we assigned two session chairs for each session: an online session chair and an in-person session chair. Online session chairs monitored questions from online participants, making sure their voices were heard. In-person chairs did the same for in-person participants. Online chairs presented remote speakers and moderated conversations with remote participants. In person session chairs moderated inperson presentations and conversations."

            "text": "All papers sessions, and the two keynote talks were streamed via Zoom. For slide presentations (with online and in-person presenters), we shared the slides on Zoom. For in-person conversations, we used Zoom to show the presenter and session chair, who were comfortably seated at the front of the meeting room. We used the \u201cspotlight\u201d feature of Zoom to place key camera views in prominent and predictable places on remote participants\u2019 screens. Specifically, we spotlighted the virtual chair and the local chair. For in-person presentations and conversations, we spotlighted the main camera of the meeting room. For presentations we would focus the camera on the presenter who would stand by a podium. For conversations we would aim the camera at two armchairs placed in the front of the meeting room. For virtual presentations and conversations, we spotlighted the remote presenter. We also spotlighted sign language interpreters.\nWe had breakout rooms in Zoom where online participants could chat during breaks. This way they could use audio without having to worry that they are interfering with the in-person participants (simply speaking in the main Zoom meeting would be heard at the in-person venue).\nWe used Discord as the communication medium for online and in-person attendees. We did not want participants to use Zoom for chatting, since we expected that this would divide participants into the online group that uses Zoom, and the in-person group that does not use Zoom."

We added our own video cameras for better visibility of the in-person sign language interpreter and for in-person questions (Figure 2). We also added lighting so that in-person presenters, session chairs, and participants asking questions would be better seen on Zoom by remote participants (Figure 2).\nWe placed armchairs at the front of the room for in-person conversations (Figure 3). These armchairs conveyed a sense of calm and comfort that we hoped would put everyone at ease."

Captions support participants with hearing impairment, and also those who might find it challenging to follow presentations and conversations in English.\nWe secured American sign-language interpreters for the conference. The interpreters worked online. And, for many of us, the CHIWORK Annual Meeting was our first opportunity to hear a presentation in which the presenters used sign language, which was instantly converted to spoken English by the sign-language interpreters.\nAlso in support of accessibility, we asked in-person participants to always use microphones so that they were clearly heard both at the venue and online. Also, we added cameras for in-person participants to use when asking questions \u2013 participants had to move to one of two laptops with cameras when asking a question."

We needed to know, at all times: (1) who should be spotlighted in Zoom, (2) who should be taking questions from the audience, and (3) which camera should we turn on, the one showing the front of the in-person venue or the audience? To be able to execute all these actions at the right time, we created a minute-by-minute breakdown of actions for us to follow \u2013 we called this our \u201crun sheet.\u201d The run sheet was in a shared spreadsheet, accessed by the organizers and student volunteers. When an action was taken care of, we would place a checkmark next to it, and move on. And of course, we practiced all these actions. We had 1-2 hour-long practice sessions almost every day for the two weeks leading up to the hybrid event. We used these practice sessions to perfect our plans, to become quick in executing them, and also to invite remote presenters to join us if they wanted to test out their setup for remote presentation."

We received 22 responses, with 15 responses indicating that they attended remotely, and 7 that they attended inperson. Of the 22 respondents, 11 were students, nine were academic researchers, and two were industry researchers. Finally, nine were women, and 13 were men.\nTheir evaluation of the hybrid event was positive. To the question \u201cWould you attend (in person or online) the 2023 CHIWORK Annual Meeting?\u201d 15 participants said yes, six said maybe, and one said no. On a scale of 1 (worst to 5 (best), 10 participants rated the scientific quality of the meeting as 5, 10 rated it as 4, and two rated it as 3.\nThe survey also asked responders to tell us about the best and worst aspects of the meeting and suggest improvements.

We opened a shared file to take down notes and invited all participants in the town hall to help us in this task of taking notes.\nPositive comments focused on (1) the efforts to include both online and in-person participants, and (2) the variety of presentation styles. Problems, and suggestions for improvements focused on (1) the difficulties with scheduling for different time zones, (2) improving organizational steps, (3) adding presentation types, and (4) adding tools to bring people closer. Table 1 shows a selection of the comments that were discussed in the town hall meeting."

            "heading": "3 LESSON LEARNED",
            "text": "The key lessons we learned from organizing this hybrid event are the following: 1. Focus on support mechanisms for online participants. We thought about what problems our online participants might\nencounter, and we attempted to help them by introducing support mechanisms such as having both an online and inperson chair, spotlighted camera views in Zoom, and a clear audio feed from the in-person venue. The feedback we received indicates that our approach worked. This made the meeting better for everyone, since online participants could more fully participate and thus enrich the meeting. 2. Online participation is hard. Fixing this might require new approaches. Our online attendees generally had a good experience. Still, people attending online will continue to face problems from scheduling time away from work and family to attend a presentation, to battling time zones, to having to deal with audio that is sometimes difficult to understand (e.g. due to a poor internet connection, or because an in-person participant does not use a microphone) . Some of these problems cannot be solved by technology. However, we can re-think how we bring a community together. For example, the CHIWORK community has weekly 60-minute online conversations which are spread out over several months a year [4]. The short duration of each conversation reduces the pressure of scheduling time away. Also, shorter meetings can more easily be scheduled at times that fit into multiple time zones.\n3. There are many technical improvements to make for hybrid events. While some problems of bringing together online and in-person audiences cannot be fixed with technology, others certainly can, including (a) online interactions, (b) bringing the sound of applause online, and (c) expanding camera views so that online participants have a good sense of the room."
