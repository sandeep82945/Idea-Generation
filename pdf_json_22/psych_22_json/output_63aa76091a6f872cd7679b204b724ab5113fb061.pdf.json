Raising awareness helps to reduce the stigma of mental ill health and can help more people come forward to seek the support they need. It also helps to highlight the scale of mental ill health and unmet need, and strengthen the case for continued support and investment to improve and expand mental health services.\nRaising awareness feels more important than ever this year amid widespread concern about a host of issues both at home and abroad and the impact of these on people\u2019s mental health, as well as their impact on the level of focus and priority we give to mental health at a national level.\nThe theme for this year\u2019s awareness week is loneliness, and mental health trust leaders have long been concerned about its impact: our pre-pandemic survey found 97% of trust leaders who responded identified loneliness and isolation as having an impact on increasing demand for services.1\nNot only is loneliness a driver of demand\u2014with chronic feelings of loneliness associated with increased risk of depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and substance misuse\u2014but longstanding andwidespread challenges in accessing services can also bring on or exacerbate loneliness among people with mental health needs. It can be incredibly lonely to wait\u2014for months and, too often, years\u2014for a diagnosis and the right care and treatment, or to be sent far from home for care due to lack of capacity in local services.\nAs we consider the impact of the pandemic and look towards shaping mental health services in response and to make them fit for the future, it\u2019s helpful to take a look at how mental health services are currently performing, where the particular pressure points are, and what is needed to address these.\nWhat has happened to demand and how have trusts been responding? Demand for mental health services has been steadily rising over the years, with the past two years putting particular pressure on people\u2019s mental health and mental health services. There were an average of 362 634 referrals a month in 2021\u201414.8% more than in 2019. Trust leaders are tellingus demandhasnot only increased, but they are also seeingmore complex and severe cases than before the pandemic.\nMental health trusts and their staff havebeenworking hard, helped by a welcome increased focus and investment, to meet as much of the demand for their services as possible: the number of people in contact with services has reached record highs with 1.5\nmillion people in contact in January 2022\u201410% more than before the pandemic.\nThroughout the pandemic, mental health trusts have sought to find new ways to maintain services and continue to make inroads on longer term plans to expand and improve the way they deliver care.2 3 For example, setting up mental health A&Es and 24/7 emergency service access lines, establishing enhanced crisis care and delivering some home-treatment models and clinical services online, as well as working to set up new models of community based mental health care.\nAccess to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services to support depression and anxiety is one area that has notably kept on track despite the challenges facing the sector over the last twoyears: latest data show90%of referralswere seen within six weeks, which means the national access standard is currently being met."

            "text": "However, we know that it is a significant challenge for trusts to meet demand for a range of other services. For example, despite trusts\u2019 best efforts, the target of 95% of children and young people referred for assessment or treatment for an eating disorder receiving treatment (within oneweek for urgent cases and four weeks for other cases) continues to be missed. In the last quarter, only around 6 in 10 individuals were being seen quickly enough.\nAnd, while it is important to recognise the NHS is delivering mental healthcare to more people than ever before, we know the NHS is only beginning to scratch the surface in terms of meeting demand for everyone in need of help. Recent data show there were 1.3 million adult \u201copen referrals\u201d and 411 000 open referrals for children and young people, which means 1.7 million individuals have reached the referral threshold for secondary care, but have not yet been seen. The number of children and young people waiting to be seen is three times higher than when records began.\nTrust leaders are also concerned that beyond these knowncases, there remains substantial, longstanding unmet need in the community and that is continuing to rise. Latest prevalence data from 2021 showed one in six childrenandyoungpeoplenowhaveaprobable mental disorder, up from 1 in 9 in 2017.4\nThe significant mismatch between the need for mental healthcare and the capacity of mental health services is a key reason why we see people placed out of area to receive the care that they need: too many people are too far away from home\u2014and their family and wider support network\u2014for too long.\n1the bmj | BMJ 2022;377:o1178 | doi: 10.1136/bmj.o1178\nOPINION\nNHS Providers\nCite this as: BMJ 2022;377:o1178\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o1178\nPublished: 10 May 2022\ncopyright. on 17 January 2024 at Indian Institute of T\nechnology P atna (IIT P atna).

However, increasing pressure on services means there are now 770 people receiving treatment away from home inappropriately\u201413% more than the same month two years ago.\nSo what do we need to address these concerns? Addressing the significant increase in demand for mental health services, how long people are waiting and how far away from home some individuals are accessing care is a complex and significant challenge. It will be key to secure sustainable levels of support and funding for mental health trusts and their wider partners, particularly social care and third sector organisations, to intervene earlier and which reflects the impact of the last two years.\nTackling loneliness in and of itself more broadly is ultimately a cross society endeavour. We need transparency on the extent of need and a robust response with proper support throughout the system, as part of a post-pandemic recovery approach. Trusts and their local partners have an important role to play and can add the most valuewhenoperating inpartnershipwithappropriately funded public health services and a government focused on addressing the wider determinants of health.\nCompeting interests: none declared\nProvenance and peer review: not commissioned, not peer reviewed.\n1 Providers NHS.
