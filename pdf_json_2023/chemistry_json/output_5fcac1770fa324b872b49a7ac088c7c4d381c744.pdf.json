    "abstractText": "In order to explore the interface adsorption mechanism of hydroxyl-substituted alkylbenzene sulfonates, the interfacial tension relaxation method was used to investigate the dilational rheology properties of sodium 2-hydroxy-3-octyl-5-octylbenzene sulfonate (C8C8OHphSO3Na) and sodium 2-hydroxy-3-octyl-5-decylbenzene sulfonate (C8C10OHphSO3Na) at the gas\u2013liquid interface and oil\u2013water interface. The effect of the length of the hydroxyl para-alkyl chain on the interfacial behavior of the surfactant molecules was investigated, and the main controlling factors of the interfacial film properties under different conditions were obtained. The experimental results show that for the gas\u2013liquid interface, the long-chain alkyl groups adjacent to the hydroxyl group in the hydroxyl-substituted alkylbenzene sulfonate molecules tend to extend along the interface, showing strong intermolecular interaction, which is the main reason why the dilational viscoelasticity of the surface film is higher than that of ordinary alkylbenzene sulfonates. The length of the para-alkyl chain has little effect on the viscoelastic modulus. With the increase in surfactant concentration, the adjacent alkyl chain also began to extend into the air, and the factors controlling the properties of the interfacial film changed from interfacial rearrangement to diffusion exchange. For the oil\u2013water interface, the presence of oil molecules will hinder the interface tiling of the hydroxyl-protic alkyl, and the dilational viscoelasticity of C8C8 and C8C10 will be greatly reduced relative to the surface. The main factor controlling the properties of the interfacial film is the diffusion exchange of surfactant molecules between the bulk phase and the interface from the beginning.",

            "text": "Surfactant is a kind of unique compound. The addition of a small amount of surfactant in the system can change the interface composition and structure and greatly reduce the surface/interfacial tension [1]. In recent years, with the continuous progress of the discipline of colloid and interface chemistry, people have no longer only paid attention to the ability of surfactants to reduce interfacial tension but have also begun to fully explore their properties in emulsification, wetting, foaming, solubilization, catalysis, anticorrosion and other aspects [2\u20135], resulting in energy saving and consumption reduction [6], biochemical detection [7], food production [8], oil exploitation [9,10] and benefits in other fields, which has brought great convenience to human production and life. As a typical anionic surfactant, alkylbenzene sulfonate is favored for use in oil fields due to its low price and wide source. At the same time, the introduction of a suitable substitution structure on benzene\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4318. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28114318 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4318 2 of 14\nring can also promote the stability of foam or emulsion [11,12]. Therefore, this kind of surfactant has become one of the most commonly used oil displacement agents in tertiary oil recovery technology over the past ten years [13,14]. When different kinds of surfactant molecules spontaneously enrich at the interface, there are differences in the number and state of adsorption. The former determines the value of the interfacial tension and the latter is closely related to the strength of the interfacial film. The interfacial tension can be directly measured by the Wilhelmy plate method [15\u201317], the rotating drop method [9,18\u201320] and other methods. However, the characterization of interfacial film strength is relatively complex. In order to avoid the interference of liquid film thickness, bulk viscosity and other factors, it is necessary to use dilational rheology [21\u201323]. The interfacial dilational rheology test chooses to apply a periodic sinusoidal disturbance to the droplet or liquid surface to make it expand and compress continuously. The strength of the interfacial film is measured by the change of the interfacial tension with the interfacial area during the dynamic process; that is, the dilational modulus. The larger the modulus, the higher the strength. The dilational modulus is composed of elastic modulus and viscous modulus. The elastic modulus represents the magnitude of the interaction between surfactant molecules at the interface, while the viscous modulus is the sum of all relaxation processes occurring at and near the interface, including the diffusion and exchange between surfactant molecules and bulk phase, the interfacial rearrangement of surfactant molecules, etc. [11,24\u201326]. The appearance of interfacial dilational rheology makes it possible to accurately divide the strength and free energy of interfacial films. Unfortunately, due to the upper limit of the oscillator, the existing dilational rheology experiments are dominated by small low-frequencies, and the oscillation frequency generally does not exceed 1 Hz [27\u201329]. It should be pointed out that for the fast relaxation processes such as diffusion exchange and reorientation of single molecules on the interface, the working frequency of 1 Hz is far from enough. At this time, after the external work on the interface film, the recovery speed of the film composition is ahead of the change speed of the interface area, which is not conducive to the full acquisition of information in the film. In this case, the interfacial tension relaxation method, as an important part of the interfacial dilational rheology, perfectly compensates for the shortcomings of the periodic oscillation method. By instantaneously expanding a fully pre-balanced interface in a short time and then recording and multi-exponentially fitting the decay process of the interfacial tension, the interfacial tension decay curve is transformed by Fourier transform in the time domain to obtain the interfacial dilational viscoelastic parameters in the frequency domain; that is, the full-frequency spectrum of dilational viscoelasticity is obtained [30,31]. The interfacial dilational rheology test of alkylbenzene sulfonates has been carried out for a long time, especially for sodium alkylbenzene sulfonates with different alkyl substitutions and branched structures [32\u201336]. Song et al. [37] explored the dilational rheological properties of three branched alkylbenzene sulfonate adsorption films at the gas\u2013 liquid interface by using the periodic oscillation method, and they found that the position of the benzene ring in the alkyl chain was one of the main factors controlling the properties of the interface film. When the benzene ring gradually moves from the end position to the more central position, that is, the degree of branching of the hydrophobic alkyl chain gradually increases, the dilational elasticity increases and the stability of the interfacial film also increases. Zhu et al. [12] investigated the adsorption behavior of polysubstituted alkylbenzene sulfonates at the n-decane-water interface by interfacial tension relaxation method, and they clarified the main controlling factors of interfacial film properties with a Cole\u2013Cole diagram. They believe that when there is no electrolyte, alkylbenzene sulfonate molecules are tiled on the oil\u2013water interface, and that the interaction is weak. The behavior of the interface film responding to the change of the interface area is a multi-relaxation process such as diffusion exchange, reorientation and interface rearrangement. With the addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+, under the action of electrostatic shielding, the surfactant molecules began to be more upright at the interface, and the interaction gradually increased.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4318 3 of 14\nAt this time, the intrafilm relaxation process dominated by reorientation controlled the properties of the interfacial film. In contrast, there are relatively few studies on the interfacial dilational rheology of hydroxyl-substituted alkylbenzene sulfonates on the benzene ring.

Results and Discussion 2.1. Full-Frequency Spectrum of Interfacial Dilational Elasticity of Adsorption Film\nInterfacial dilational elasticity is a quantitative description of the interaction strength of surfactant molecules at the interface. Figure 1 shows the full-frequency spectra of the dilational elasticity of hydroxyl-substituted alkylbenzene sulfonate C8C8 with different concentrations, where (A) is the gas\u2013liquid interface and (B) is the oil\u2013water interface. As the frequency increases, the dynamic modulus curve gradually increases and finally reaches a plateau value, representing the whole process of the state of the interface film from full recovery to ntimely change. The cha a teristics of the curve are d scribed by the freq ency \u03c91 at which the el sticity begins to increase and the frequency \u03c90 t at does not change, as shown in Figure 1.

The higher the concentration, the faster the diffusion exchange process and the higher the corresponding frequency value, which is reasonable. In addition, for Figure 2, \u03c91 at the gas\u2013liquid interface is significantly higher than that at the oil\u2013water interface in the entire experimental concentration range. This difference should be caused by the difference in the arrangement of surfactant molecules at different types of interfaces. At the gas\u2013liquid interface, the hydroxyl and sulfonic acid groups on the benzene ring have good water solubility, they exist in the benzene ring in an adjacent location manner, which will have a certain \u201cpositioning\u201d effect on the interface orientation of the entire molecule. The long-chain alkyl at the ortho position of the hydroxyl group tends to extend along the interface, while the long-chain alkyl at the para position of the hydroxyl group tends to extend into the air. However, at the oil\u2013water interface, the presence of oil molecules will destroy the van der Waals force between the hydroxyl groups, and the two alkyl chains on the hydrophobic side begin to tend to stretch upright in the oil phase. Surprisingly, for the two surfactants selected in this paper, the interaction between n-decane and hydrophobic alkyl chains has a more obvious inhibitory effect on the diffusion and exchange behavior of surfactant molecules at the interface. The surfactant molecules that originally lost the \u201clateral bondage\u201d are re-affected by the \u201clongitudinal draw\u201d on the oil side, and the diffusion exchange becomes more difficult to occur. The value of \u03c91 is significantly lower than that of the gas\u2013liquid interface. In addition, by comparing the \u03c91 values in Figure 2A,B, we found that for the oil-water interfacial film, the \u03c91 of C8C10 with a longer alkyl chain in the hydroxyl para position is always slightly smaller than C8C8 with a relatively short chain length in the whole concentration range, which fully demonstrates the strong interaction between the long alkyl chain in the hydroxyl para position and the oil molecules."

The dilational elastic value reaches the platform, which means that the molecules forming the interface film do not exchange with the bulk phase during the perturbation process; at the same time, the molecules on the interface cannot dissipate energy through orientation changes. It should be pointed out that the relaxation processes near the interface film all have their characteristic frequencies, and the frequency \u03c90 corresponding to the limit dilational elasticity must be greater than all the characteristic frequencies. The dynamic curve in Figure 3 shows that for C8C8 and C8C10, \u03c90 increases with the increase in concentration, whether it is adsorbed at the gas\u2013liquid interface or the oil\u2013water interface. The increase in concentration first leads to the intensification of diffusion exchange behavior between bulk phase and interface. At the same time, for the surfactant molecules on the interface, the increase in adsorption quantity means that the molecular orientation is more and more prone to change, and the change of conformation provides a new relaxation process for the system. Therefore, for a group of homologues with similar interface behavior, with the increase in surfactant concentration, the frequency corresponding to the limit dilational elasticity must be higher and higher. In addition, for C8C8, the value of \u03c90 at the oil\u2013water interface at high concentration begins to become lower than that at the gas\u2013liquid interface, which seems to imply the weakening of intermolecular interaction on the surface film; the specific reason will be discussed in detail in the next section.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4318 6 of 14 Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 14\n10-8 10-7 10-6 10-5 10-4 10-3\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102 (A)\nC/(mol\u00b7L-1)\nC8C8 Air\u2013water interface Decane\u2013water interface\n\u03c9 0 /H\nz\n10-8 10-7 10-6 10-5 10-4 10-3\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102 (B)\nC/(mol\u00b7L-1)\nC8C10 Air\u2013water interface Decane\u2013water interface\n\u03c9 0 /H\nz\nFigure 3.

The difference is that the concentration of the transition of the C8C8 system is more delayed, and the \u03b50 value that can be achieved is higher, which may be caused by the difference in the length of the hydroxyl para-alkyl chain. The longer the length of the para-alkyl chain, the more unfavorable to the tile of the para-alkyl on the gas\u2013liquid interface, and the positioning effect is less stable. For the interfacial adsorption film, the stacking structure formed between the alkyl chains is weakened, which is mainly controlled by the behavior of single molecules, the structural similarity leads to the close \u03b50 values of C8C8 and C8C10. Although the strong interaction between the oil phase and the double-chain alkyl of the surfactant maintains the stability of the surfactant molecules at the interface, the avoidance of diffusion exchange does not mean the continuation of the intermolecular interaction. Compared with the limit dilational elasticity of the surfactant molecules at the gas\u2013liquid interface and oil\u2013water interface, the value at the oil\u2013water interface is about 1/3 of that at the gas\u2013liquid interface. The intermolecular interaction formed by the adjacent alkyl chains of hydroxyl group is indeed destroyed by the insertion of oil molecules."

Viscosity modulus is the sum of all relaxation processes occurring at and near the interface, including the diffusion exchange of surfactant molecules between the interface and the bulk phase, the single molecule reorientation of the surfactant at the interface and the rearrangement of a large number of molecules. Among them, the existence of diffusion exchange will weaken the film strength, while other relaxation processes in the film can promote the film strength. Moreover, in addition to the insoluble film formed by the protein, the adsorption film formed by all surfactants has at least a diffusion exchange effect. Therefore, the viscosity must exist for the conventional surface-interface or oil\u2013water system.

C8C8 and C8C10 have the same length of hydroxyl ortho alkyl chain, which corresponds to the same maximum viscosity modulus at the gas\u2013liquid interface. In addition, we have also investigated the surface dilational rheology properties of the same series of C10C10 (Sodium 2-hydroxy-3,5-didecylbenzenesulfonate). The maximum dilational modulus can reach 300 mN/m [46], which is significantly larger than the two compounds with shorter hydroxyl ortho alkyl chains in this paper.

At this time, the properties of the interface film are mainly controlled by the slow relaxation process such as interface rearrangement.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4318 10 of 14\nWith the further increase in the surfactant concentration, the ortho alkyl group begins to gradually extend to the air and the relaxation process begins to be dominated by diffusion exchange. On the other hand, at the oil\u2013water interface, oil molecules will destroy the interaction between the adjacent alkyl groups and hydroxyl groups. The properties of the interface film have always been controlled by single-molecule fast relaxation processes such as diffusion exchange. However, with the increase in adsorption quantity on the interface, the alkyl chain is more and more affected by the oil phase, which will increase the difficulty of diffusion exchange to a certain extent and the characteristic frequency will be slightly reduced at high concentration. It should be pointed out that the above molecular arrangement diagram is obtained when distilled water is used as the solvent, while in the actual application process, a certain ionic strength is often retained in the aqueous phase. For hydroxyl-substituted alkylbenzene sulfonates, the presence of ionic strength often produces electrostatic shielding and enhances the intermolecular interaction on the surface-interface. Therefore, whether it is the gas\u2013liquid interface or the oil\u2013water interface, the characteristic time of the slow relaxation process is likely to become longer and change the main controlling factor of the interfacial film properties."

The main controlling factors of surface-interface film properties under different conditions were clarified and the following conclusions were obtained:\n(1) The sulfonic acid group and hydroxyl group on the benzene ring all interact with the water phase, which will have a certain \u201cpositioning\u201d effect on the interfacial configuration of the surfactant molecules. The long-chain alkyl groups adjacent to the hydroxyl group tend to extend along the interface, showing strong intermolecular interaction; while the long-chain alkyl at the para position of the hydroxyl group tends to extend into the air. Therefore, the length of the hydroxyl ortho alkyl chain is the main controlling factor of the film properties and has little to do with the length of the para-alkyl chain. (2) For the gas\u2013liquid interface, at first, due to the interaction between alkyl chains, the properties of the interfacial film are mainly controlled by the slow relaxation process of interfacial rearrangement. With the further increase in surfactant concentration, the adjacent alkyl groups and hydroxyl groups begin to extend to the air, and the interfacial film begins to be controlled by the fast relaxation process that is dominated by diffusion exchange. (3) For the oil\u2013water interface, the insertion of oil molecules will destroy the interaction between alkyl chains. The properties of the interfacial film have always been controlled by the fast relaxation process that is dominated by diffusion exchange. With the further increase in surfactant concentration, the interaction between alkyl chains and oil phase is enhanced, and the characteristic frequency of the fast relaxation process will be slightly reduced.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4318 12 of 14\nAuthor Contributions: Investigation, L.Z.
