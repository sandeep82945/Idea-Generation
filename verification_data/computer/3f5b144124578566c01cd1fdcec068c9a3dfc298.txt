Given the extensive text provided, it's clear that the research paper discusses the development and application of a novel model for community detection in directed networks, specifically focusing on the Directed Degree Corrected Mixed Membership (DiDCMM) model. The paper outlines the theoretical underpinnings of the model, its algorithmic implementation (DiMSC), and its application to both synthetic and real-world networks. The future research directions mentioned in the paper are not explicitly labeled as such but can be inferred from sections discussing limitations, potential improvements, and unexplored avenues related to the model and its applications. Here are the inferred future research directions based on the provided text:

1. "Though the above works are encouraging and appealing, they focus on undirected networks. In reality, there exist substantial directed networks, such as citation networks, protein–protein interaction networks, and the hyperlink network of websites. In recent years, a lot of works with encouraging results have been developed for directed networks."

2. "Meanwhile, our results also show that modeling a directed network with mixed membership when considering degree heterogeneity for both row and column nodes needs nontrivial conditions."

3. "For the empirical case, let Ŝ ∈ Rn×m be a matrix where all rows have unit l2 norm, infer H from Ŝ with given K is called the empirical cone problem, i.e., Problem 2 in [26]. For the empirical cone problem, one-class SVM is applied to all rows of Ŝ to obtain w and b’s estimations ŵ and b̂."

4. "The fact that ideal cases for the above spectral algorithms can return community information also supports the identifiability of the above models."

5. "The model DiDCMM and the algorithm DiMSC developed in this paper are useful to discover asymmetry for a directed network with mixed memberships. DiDCMM can also generate an artificially directed network with mixed memberships as a benchmark directed network for research purposes."

6. "We wish that DiDCMM and DiMSC can be widely applied in social network analysis."

These excerpts suggest areas for future exploration, including extending the model to more complex network structures, addressing the challenges of modeling networks with mixed memberships and degree heterogeneities, improving algorithmic approaches for community detection, and applying the model to a broader range of real-world networks.
