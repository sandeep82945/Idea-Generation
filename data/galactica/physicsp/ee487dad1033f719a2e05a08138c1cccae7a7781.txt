hERG (human Ether-à-go-go Related Gene)-encoded potassium channels underlie the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier (IKr) potassium current, which is a major target for antiarrhythmic agents and diverse non-cardiac drugs linked to the drug-induced form of long QT syndrome. E-4031 is a high potency hERG channel inhibitor from the methanesulphonanilide drug family. This study utilized a methanesulphonate-lacking E-4031 analogue, “E-4031-17”, to evaluate the role of the methanesulphonamide group in E-4031 inhibition of hERG. Whole-cell patch-clamp measurements of the hERG current (IhERG) were made at physiological temperature from HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type (WT) and mutant hERG constructs. For E-4031, WT IhERG was inhibited by a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 15.8 nM, whilst the comparable value for E-4031-17 was 40.3 nM. Both compounds exhibited voltageand time-dependent inhibition, but they differed in their response to successive applications of a long (10 s) depolarisation protocol, consistent with greater dissociation of E-4031-17 than the parent compound between applied commands. Voltage-dependent inactivation was left-ward voltage shifted for E-4031 but not for E-4031-17; however, inhibition by both compounds was strongly reduced by attenuated-inactivation mutations. Mutations of S6 and S5 aromatic residues (F656V, Y652A, F557L) greatly attenuated actions of both drugs. The S624A mutation also reduced IhERG inhibition by both molecules. Overall, these results demonstrate that the lack of a methanesulphonate in E-4031-17 is not an impediment to high potency inhibition of IhERG. 1. conclusions Removal of the methanesulphonate group of E-4031 does not adversely affect the hERG-blocking capability of the compound, nor does it eliminate a dependence of high potency inhibition on S5 and S6 aromatic residues. Polar substituents previously considered to be important determinants for drug interaction with amino acid side chains in the hERG pore are not necessarily required for high-affinity hERG block; the reduction of E-4031-17 inhibition by S624A suggests that this residue can influence block allosterically (likely through promoting interactions of the protonated nitrogen of the drug molecule with the cavity K+ binding site below the selectivity filter), as it lacks hydrogen bonding potential. The observed differences between E-4031 and E-4031-17 in accumulation of block during repeated application of sustained depolarisation voltage commands raise the possibility that E-4031-17 might exhibit altered use-/rate-dependence of action. 4. materials and methods  4.1. herg expressing cell lines and mutants employed Experiments on WT hERG current (IhERG) utilized a Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293) cell line stably expressing hERG, kindly donated by Prof Craig January [30]. The HEK 293 cell line stably expressing the S6 Y652A mutation was used as described previously [65]. Mutations at the base of the pore helix (T623A, S624A), S6 helix (F656V), and S5 (F557L) were studied using transient transfection of HEK 293 cells and were used as described previously [20,29,66]. The attenuated-inactivation mutants N588K and S620T were also studied through transient transfection, as previously [20,31,39]. 4.2. maintenance of mammalian cell lines and transfection HEK 293 cells transiently or stably expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant hERG constructs were maintained as previously described [20,29]. Cells were maintained in 40 mm Petri dishes and incubated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Transient transfections utilized either Lipofectamine 2000TM or Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. As described previously [20], the amount of hERG construct DNA transfected varied from 0.1 to 1 µg according to observed levels of functional expression. CD8 (0.1 µg) was used as a transfection marker, with successfully transfected cells identified using Dynabeads® (Invitrogen). Cells were plated onto sterilized glass coverslip shards at least 24 h prior to electrophysiological recording [20]. 4.3. electrophysiological recordings Glass coverslip shards onto which cells were plated were placed into a recording chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot, Nikon Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were superfused at 37 ± 1 ◦C with a Tyrode’s solution containing (in mM): NaCl 140, KCl 4, CaCl2 2.5, MgCl21, glucose 10, HEPES 5 (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH). The T623A mutation is poorly expressing and requires measurement of inward IhERG in high external [K+] ([K+]e) [20]. High [K+] Tyrode for measurement of T623A IhERG and its corresponding WT control contained 94 mM KCl and 50 mM NaCl, but was otherwise similar to the standard Tyrode’s solution. Pipettes for whole-cell patch-clamp recording (Schott number 8250 glass, A-M Systems Inc., Sequim, WA, USA) were pulled and polished (Narishige, PP 830 and Narishige, MF 83, respectively) to resistance values between 2 and 4 MΩ. The intracellular solution contained (in mM): KCl 130, MgCl 1, EGTA, MgATP 5, and HEPES 10 (titrated to pH 7.2 with KOH). The liquid junction potential (LJP) between the pipette solution and bath solution was calculated as 3.2 mV, and as this

was small, it was not corrected. Series resistance was corrected by 70–80% [20]. E-4031 (Tocris, Bristol, UK) and E-4031-17 ([26] kindly provided by Prof A. IJzerman, Leiden University) were dissolved in DMSO to give stock solutions of 300 µM, 1 mM, and 10 mM. Aliquots of stock solution were added to Tyrode’s solution to give the final concentrations referred to in the Results section (final DMSO concentration was less than 0.1% for all experiments). During recordings, local superfusate was exchanged using a home-built heated solution exchange device that was capable of exchanging solution in < 1 s. IhERG block by methanesulphonanilides is known to develop progressively [67]. Consistent with this, IhERG inhibition developed slowly for E-4031 and E-4031-17; therefore, run-down correction was required for adjustment of fractional block monitored with the standard protocol (Figure 2; and [20]) used here for concentration-response data. WT IhERG run down was monitored and calculated as 15.7 ± 3.7% (n = 7) after 10 min of recording. Rundown correction using the standard protocol in this way has been conducted previously (e.g., [20]). Electrophysiological recordings were made using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) and a CV203BU head stage. A Digidata 1320 interface (Molecular Devices) was used for data acquisition. Data digitization rates used were between 10 and 25 kHz during all voltage protocols, and an appropriate bandwidth was set on the amplifier between 2 and 10 kHz [20]. Data were analysed using Clampfit 10.3 (Molecular Devices), Prism versions 4.03 and 5.03, and Excel 2013. Data are presented as the mean ±S.E.M. (Standard Error of the Mean) or as mean with ±95% CI (Confidence Intervals). Statistical comparisons were carried out using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (paired or un-paired as appropriate) and either one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni post hoc test. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Levels of significance are indicated on Figures and described in Figure legends. 4.4. equations used for analysis Fractional inhibition of IhERG was determined as follows:
Fractional Inhibition = 1 − ( IhERG−Drug
IhERG−Control
) (1)
for which IhERG-Drug represents current amplitude in the presence of a given concentration of E-4031 or E-4031-17 and IhERG-Control represents current amplitude in control solution prior to drug application. Concentration-response relationships were generated by plotting the mean fractional inhibition of hERG tail currents evoked at −40 mV (protocol shown in Figure 2; fractional inhibition determined using Equation (1)) in the presence of different drug concentrations at steady state. Mean ±S.E.M. experimental points were fitted with a standard Hill equation:
Fractional Inhibition = 1/(1 + ( IC50 [drug] )h) (2)
where fractional inhibition at a given concentration of drug [drug] is calculated using Equation (1); the concentration of drug that produces half maximal inhibition is IC50 and the Hill slope is h. The voltage-dependence of IhERG activation was investigated by fitting normalised tail currents elicited using the protocol shown in Figure 2 with a Boltzmann equation as follows:
I = IMAX/(1 + exp (
V0.5 − Vm k
) ) (3)
In this equation, I is the amplitude of tail current following the test potential, Vm, IMAX is the maximal current, V0.5 is the voltage that produces half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor of the fitted relation. Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1204 17 of 20
The voltage-dependence of hERG inactivation was investigated by calculating IhERG availability, using a three-step protocol (Figure 4A; also [20,29,65,68]). The amplitude of the resurgent currents elicited by the final step of the protocol was corrected for potential deactivation as described previously [39,69] and the elicited currents were normalised to the maximal current observed during this phase of the protocol. Normalised current was plotted against the value of the 2 ms test potential and fitted with a Boltzmann equation as follows:
I IMAX
= 1 − ( 1 + exp [
V0.5 − Vm k
]) (4)
In this equation, I is the peak amplitude of the resurgent peak at the start of the third step, IMAX is the maximum current observed during the third step following the brief 2 ms step at the test potential (Vm). V0.5 is the potential that produces half-maximal inactivation and k is the slope factor for the fitted relationship.
