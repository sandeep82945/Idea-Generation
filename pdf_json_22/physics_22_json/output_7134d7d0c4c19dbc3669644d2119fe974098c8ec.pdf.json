    "abstractText": "The dynamic voltage is a unique phenomenon of superconducting materials. It arises when the superconductor is carrying a DC transport current and spontaneously in subject to an AC magnetic field. This study excavates the aspects that previous studies have not comprehensively investigated: the dynamic voltage in a DC-carrying superconducting tape exposed to different oscillating AC magnetic fields. First, the fundamental physics of dynamic voltage/flux of superconductors is reviewed and further analysed in detail. We used the superconducting modelling method using the H-formulation merged into the finite-element method (FEM) software, to re-produce the typical dynamic voltage behaviour of a superconducting tape. The modelling was verified by both the analytical and experimental results, in order to precisely prove the reliability of the modelling. Afterwards, the modelling was performed for a DC-carrying superconducting tape under four different oscillating magnetic fields (sine, triangle, sawtooth and square), and their corresponding dynamic voltages and energy losses were analysed and compared. Results show the sinusoidal magnetic field can lead to the optimal combination of reasonable dynamic voltage but relatively lower loss, which is suitable for those superconducting applications requiring dynamic voltage as the energy source, e.g., flux pumps. This article presents novel investigation and analysis of the dynamic voltage in superconducting materials, and both the methodology and results can provide useful information for the future design/analysis of superconducting applications with DC transport currents and AC magnetic fields.",

            "text": "Since the superconducting phenomenon was discovered by Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, superconducting materials have evolved from the Type-I superconductors (many of them are pure metals), to the Type-II superconductors (e.g., oxides and ceramics) [1]. This evolution also promoted the superconducting materials to operate at a relatively higher temperature, from 4.2 K up to over 100 K under atmospheric pressure. Later on, scientists defined the critical temperature (the transition temperature from superconducting state to normal state) as 30 K, to distinguish the low-temperature superconductor (LTS) and hightemperature superconductor (HTS) [2]. The practical superconductors for engineering can be made in the forms of bulks or wires (tapes) [3,4]. For commercial superconducting wires, based on different manufacture processes, there are two generations of superconductors: 1st generation (1G) superconducting wires use the powder-in-tube process, such as the Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BSCCO-2212) and Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10 (BSCCO-2223); 2nd generation (2G)\nMaterials 2022, 15, 795. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15030795 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 795 2 of 14\nsuperconducting wires use the coated conductor method to deposit the rare-earth-bariumcopper-oxide (REBa2Cu3O7, RE: rare earth [5]) on flexible metal tapes coated by multiple buffering layers [6]. For all these types of superconductors, they have the fascinating advantage of zeroresistance characteristics. However, the zero-resistance behaviour has several constraints: the critical current Ic, critical magnetic field (intensity) Hc and critical temperature Tc, and these constrains are variables which are dependent on each other [1]. If the superconductor cannot operate within these constraints, the zero-resistance state will be violated. Additionally, the superconductors are lossless with the DC conditions (e.g., DC transport current and DC magnetic field), but superconductors suffer losses when they are carrying AC transports and/or exposed to AC magnetic field [7,8]. These losses can be classified as the \u2018AC loss\u2019, which can be instantly converted to the heat dissipation and cause burdens and problems for the cryogenic superconducting system [9]. Another combination for superconductors carrying DC currents and in the presence of AC magnetic fields can also cause AC losses. This is a unique phenomenon of superconductors that a DC voltage is induced (generally defined as the dynamic voltage), and along with the DC transport current a virtual DC resistance can be seen (generally called the dynamic resistance) [10\u201312]. This phenomenon is relevant to superconducting applications such as the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) magnets, and superconducting synchronous machines. The dynamic voltage/flux phenomenon is crucial for understanding the mechanism of rectifier-transformer flux pumps [13]. Therefore, the investigations of dynamic voltage/resistance become important for the design of these superconducting applications with high-performance. The superconducting dynamic voltage/resistance has been analytically studied [10\u201312], and can also be investigated by experiments [14\u201316], and modellings [17\u201319]. However, previous studies only used the sinusoidal signal (or mono-type AC signal) as the waveform of the AC magnetic field, but the systematic investigation of dynamic voltage/resistance using other types of oscillating AC fields is still missing. In addition, studying superconductors under different oscillations could be useful as the parameters and states can change in the oscillations, e.g., the boundary of the YBCO/YMnO3 interfaces [20], and there are systems that show superconductivity suppression with RE = Pr substitution [21]. In this article, the modelling was based on the professional superconducting formulation using the finite-element method (FEM). The modelling was verified by agreeing with the analytical characteristics and experiment. Later, a DC-carrying superconducting tape under four different oscillating magnetic fields (sine, triangle, sawtooth and square) was modelled, and their corresponding dynamic voltages and energy losses were analysed and compared. Further study was carried out to find the optimal case which was sensible for sufficient dynamic voltage and relatively low total loss. The novel investigation and analysis of the DC-carrying superconducting tape with different oscillating magnetic fields are useful to provide guidelines for the dynamic voltage/resistance studies, and predict complex situations for relevant superconducting applications."

The physics of superconductivity is complex, which includes the electromagnetics, thermodynamics, materials and quantum mechanics. Fortunately, there are several analytical models which are able to offer convenient approaches to predict the physical phenomenon of superconductivity. One of the most symbolic and widely used analytical models is the Bean Model [22,23], as shown in Figure 1.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 795 3 of 14aterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 14\nFigure 1. Bean model for a superconducting slab in the presence of an AC magnetic field in the z direction with infinite length in the y-z plane, with the add-ups of a DC transport current in the y direction and four different oscillating magnetic fields (sine, triangle, sawtooth and square).\nThe original Bean model (does not include the DC transport current in the y direc-\ntion) predicts a superconducting slab in the presence of an AC magnetic field in the z\ndirection with infinite length in the y-z plane.

The H-formulation uses the E-J power relation to present the superconducting behaviour that is close to critical state models and even closer to the real superconducting behaviour of HTS. Therefore, the H-formulation was chosen to simulate the dynamic voltage phenomenon of HTS tapes. The comprehensive derivation of H-formulation can be found in our previous study [24]. The key governing equation of H-formulation is:\n\u2202(\u00b50\u00b5rH) \u2202t +\u2207\u00d7 (\u03c1\u2207\u00d7H) = 0 (4)\nwhere the H is the magnetic field intensity, \u00b5r is the relative permeability and \u00b50 is the free space permeability. As the critical current of HTS ReBCO tapes has strong dependence with the magnetic field, an anisotropic field-dependent critical current model was also implemented into the H-formulation:\nJc(B) = Jc0(\n1 +\n\u221a (kBpara) 2 +Bperp2\nBc )b (5) where Bperp and Bpara are the perpendicular and parallel components of magnetic field. Detailed parameters of the modelling can be found in Table 1. Equations (4) and (5), and a full collection of the electromagnetic equations (including the Maxwell\u2019s equations) were merged into the FEM software COMSOL to model the superconducting dynamic voltage phenomenon.

As the superconducting dynamic voltage phenomenon only appears in the superconducting materials, so in this study other metal and buffer layers were ignored, and only the superconducting layer (thickness 1 \u00b5m) was studied in detail.

The minimum instantaneous dynamic voltage occurred around the sinusoidal AC magnetic field and reached the maximum or minimum, where the time derivative of the magnetic field was zero.

The overall instantaneous dynamic voltage pattern of sawtooth case was much different from the instantaneous dynamic voltage pattern of sinusoidal case and triangle case. The frequency of instantaneous dynamic voltage waveform was the same as the frequency of the sawtooth AC magnetic field, which could be due to the sawtooth signal only had one sharp decreasing part and one relatively mild increasing part in every cycle, but the sinusoidal case and triangle case had 2 up-and-down parts in every cycle. There was a sharp spike of instantaneous dynamic voltage up to 0.7 V/m in each cycle. However, as shown in Figure 8, when the flat waveforms were zoomed in, the maximum instantaneous dynamic voltage in the general region was about 0.01 V/m with the peak magnetic field 90 mT, which was even smaller than the half of the sinusoidal case and triangle case.

However, as shown in Equation (6), there are magnetisation losses in the superconducting materials that account for the total energy supplied by the system power sources. Therefore, it is meaningful to study the composition of dynamic voltage energy within the total energy.\nQtotal = Qdynamic + Qmagnetisation (6)\nFigure 10 presents the ratios of Qdynamic/Qtotal of a 4 mm HTS tape, carrying a 30 A DC transport current, and in the presence of four different perpendicular AC magnetic fields (sinusoidal, triangle, sawtooth and square) at 50 Hz, with the peak magnitude 9 mT. It can be found the Qdynamic/Qtotal with the sinusoidal magnetic field was higher than the Qdynamic/Qtotal of triangle and sawtooth magnetic fields for most of the time. The Qdynamic/Qtotal with the square magnetic field maintained the highest over the Qdynamic/Qtotal with other three magnetic fields. However, it should be noted that although the ratio Qdynamic/Qtotal with square case was high, the real value of the dynamic voltage was still in a low level. Figure 11 shows the average dynamic of a 4 mm HTS tape, carrying a 30 A DC transport current, and in the presence of four different perpendicular AC magnetic fields (sinusoidal, triangle, sawtooth and square) at 50 Hz, with the peak magnitude 90 mT. As shown in Figure 11, the average dynamic voltage with the square magnetic field was much smaller than the average dynamic voltage with the other three cases. Although the average dynamic voltage with the sawtooth magnetic field was slightly higher than the average dynamic voltage with the sinusoidal case, its corresponding magnetisation loss was much higher due to the fast transition region. To summarise, the sinusoidal magnetic field was able to lead to reasonably high dynamic voltage, and also with a sensible Qdynamic/Qtotal\nratio, which could be the most suitable choice among the four different magnetic fields to\nenergise relevant superconducting devices.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 795 12 of 14\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 14 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 -80 -40 0 40 80\n0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.0\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 B A C ( m T )\nBAC 30 mT BAC 50 mT BAC 70 mT BAC 90 mT\n0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04\n0.000 0.005 0.010 0.015 D y n a m ic v o lt a g e ( V /m )\nTime (s)\nBAC 30 mT BAC 50 mT BAC 70 mT BAC 90 mT D y n a m ic v o lt a g e ( V /m )\nTime (s)\nBAC 30 mT BAC 50 mT BAC 70 mT BAC 90 mT\nFigure 8.
