    "abstractText": "Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) is one of the major food legume crops grown extensively in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. The determinate habit of cowpea has many advantages over the indeterminate and is well adapted to modern farming systems. Mutation breeding is an active research area to develop the determinate habit of cowpea. The present study aimed to develop new determinate habit mutants with terminal flowering (TFL) in locally well-adapted genetic backgrounds. Consequently, the seeds of popular cowpea cv P152 were irradiated with doses of gamma rays (200, 250, and, 300 Gy), and the M1 populations were grown. The M2 populations were produced from the M1 progenies and selected determinate mutants (TFLCM-1 and TFLCM-2) from the M2 generation (200 Gy) were forwarded up to the M5 generation to characterize the mutants and simultaneously they were crossed with P152 to develop a MutMap population. In the M5 generation, determinate mutants (80\u201381 days) were characterized by evaluating the TFL growth habit, longer peduncles (30.75\u201331.45 cm), erect pods (160 \u030a200 \u030a), number of pods per cluster (4\u20135 nos.), and early maturity. Further, sequencing analysis of the VuTFL1 gene in the determinate mutants and MutMap population revealed a single nucleotide transversion (A-T at 1196 bp) in the fourth exon and asparagine (N) to tyrosine (Y) amino acid change at the 143 position of phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP). Notably, the loss of function PEPB with a higher confidence level modification of anti-parallel beta-sheets and destabilization of the protein secondary structure was observed in the mutant lines.

            "text": "Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) is one of the major food legume crops grown exten-\nsively in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. The determinate habit of cowpea has many\nadvantages over the indeterminate and is well adapted to modern farming systems. Muta-\ntion breeding is an active research area to develop the determinate habit of cowpea. The\npresent study aimed to develop new determinate habit mutants with terminal flowering\n(TFL) in locally well-adapted genetic backgrounds. Consequently, the seeds of popular cow-\npea cv P152 were irradiated with doses of gamma rays (200, 250, and, 300 Gy), and the M1 populations were grown. The M2 populations were produced from the M1 progenies and selected determinate mutants (TFLCM-1 and TFLCM-2) from the M2 generation (200 Gy) were forwarded up to the M5 generation to characterize the mutants and simultaneously they were crossed with P152 to develop a MutMap population. In the M5 generation, deter-\nminate mutants (80\u201381 days) were characterized by evaluating the TFL growth habit, longer\npeduncles (30.75\u201331.45 cm), erect pods (160\u02da- 200\u02da), number of pods per cluster (4\u20135\nnos.), and early maturity.

            "text": "Grain legumes have been an affordable and sustainable source of human dietary protein for centuries. Owing to its potential, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [1] called them \u201cNutritious seeds for a sustainable future\u201d. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) is a nutritionally secure and climate-resilient crop as it supplies a plethora of nutrients at a low cost and has the ability to grow in unforgiving and harsh climatic conditions by fixing atmospheric nitrogen in the soil [2]. It is mainly cultivated by marginal farmers as rice fallow pulses. Despite its versatility and relevance to agriculture, cowpea productivity is very low, and the least importance is given to its production technology. A steep reduction in productivity is mainly due to its indeterminate twining growth habits and asynchronous maturity [3]. The prostrate growth habit of cowpea deviates most of its energy in the vegetative phase, leaving less photosynthates for the sink [4]. Furthermore, it requires more spacing than other pulses and makes intercultural operations a challenging task. At the time of harvest, half of the pods remain immature due to asynchronous maturity. This necessitates two or more pickings for complete harvest and requires a large number of labours. Cowpea possesses genetic variation in terms of growth habit types and it has been classified as indeterminate or determinate habit depending on whether the terminal meristems are vegetative or reproductive. The determinate habit of cowpea has many advantages over the indeterminate including early flowering, synchronised maturity, photo insensitivity, ease of mechanical harvesting and intercultural operations, and, suitable for modern farming systems. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a cowpea line with high yield, determinate growth pattern/ terminal flowering (TFL), erect growth habit, and branches with pods above the canopy of a plant is necessary. Moreover, altering the ideotype of cowpea from indeterminate to determinate types would enhance its adaptability and stability towards climate change [5,6] and to address labour shortage problems by its suitability for mechanical harvest [7].\nThe life cycle of cowpea is bifurcated into vegetative and reproductive growth phases. The\ntransition from one phase to the other is controlled by a series of genetic pathways and physiological signals [8,9]. Shoot apical meristem (SAM) plays a key role in the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase [10]. In the determinate types, SAM will be transmuted to terminal floral meristem and it arrests the vegetative growth, contrarily SAM continues to grow and extends the vegetative growth in indeterminate types [11]. TFL is controlled by the highly conserved TFL1 (TERMINAL FLOWER 1)/CEN (CENTRORADIALIS) gene [12,13] that consists of four exons and three introns and is located in chromosome 1 [5,14]. TFL1 plays a diverse role in signaling pathways regulating growth and differentiation [15]. It also helps in maintaining floral architecture, flowering time, and self-pruning habits [16,17]. TFL1 and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are the two genes from the PEBP family which determine the flowering of the plants [18]. FT and TFL1 genes act oppositely while regulating the flowering. FT converts SAM to a flower thus promoting flowering [19] whereas TFL1 prolongs the SAM and delays the up-regulation of the flowering gene FT resulting in indeterminate growth habit\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295509 December 14, 2023 2 / 20\nData Availability Statement: All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting information files.\nFunding: Research work was supported by the \"Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS)\" by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Trombay, India.

A mutation in TFL1 with a functional loss is expected to result in the conversion of apical meristem into terminal flower [21,22]. Ahn, Miller [23] reported that a functional mutation in the fourth exon provides greater plasticity for the conversion of indeterminate to determinate plant types. Among the different approaches deployed for altering the ideotype of the plant, gamma-ray induced mutations were found to be effective and its feasibility in inducing the TFL in cowpea has been previously manifested by Pandey and Dhanasekar [24] and Dhanasekar and Reddy [5].\nMutation breeding is an active research area to develop the determinate habit of cowpea. MutMap combines mutation breeding with hybridization to construct the mapping population at the mutant loci. This method targets the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) responsible for phenotypic modification which is procreated through direct mutagenesis and relies upon the cross between the mutant type and its wild type [25]. MutMap technique was first deployed by Abe, Kosugi [26] in rice for mapping traits that are regulated by monogenic recessive genes. Previous reports in soybean, Arabidopsis, and rose suggested that TFL1 is a homozygous recessive gene [27,28]. In light of the above facts, the present study aimed at identifying the new determinate habit mutants with TFL by mutation breeding approach. For this purpose, we developed the M1-M5 mutants and MutMap population and identified the new determinate habit mutants with TFL. In addition, we have also characterized the mutants by sequence and expression analyses. The newly identified cowpea mutants from this research are useful genetic stocks for genetic improvement and breeding."

The molecular functional disruption was prophesied by MutPred2 and was attributed to the loss of the catalytic site at R139 (P = 0.05) and the gain of sulfation at N143 (P = 0.04). KEGG orthology predicted it to be a phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (PEBP) involved in the peptidase inhibitors pathway and flower development. KEGG orthology prognosticated that mutant/SNP will affect the biological function of PEBP by negative regulation of flower development. It could also affect the molecular function i.e., transcription coregulatory activity in PEBP. In a nutshell, the SNP obtained due to the mutagenic treatment of gamma rays in the P152 cultivar had a deleterious effect on PEBP and negative regulation of the VuTFL1 gene.\nExpression profiling of VuTFL1 gene The qRT PCR analysis of the VuTFL1 gene at various growth stages of TFL mutants and wild type is depicted in Fig 4. A slight reduction in the expression level of the VuTFL1 gene was observed in TFL mutants compared to wild type during the V4 stage of crop growth. In R5/ flowering growth stage, the highest reduction in the expression level of the VuTFL1 gene was observed in TFL mutants compared to the wild type. It confers that the down-regulation of the VuTFL1 gene at the flowering stage leads to TFL in cowpea. Furthermore, the difference in the expression level of mutants and wild type is reduced in the R7 growth stage of cowpea. The lowest expression of the VuTFL1 gene was observed at the R7 stage in both TFL mutants and wild type."

            "text": "Cowpeas have an indeterminate growth habit, which results in delayed maturity, non-synchronous flowering, photosensitivity, difficulties in intercultural operations, and mechanical harvesting. Most of the Indian landraces and cultivars are indeterminate in nature as this trait was somehow inherited during domestication owing to its multiple pod pickings at regular intervals. Mutation breeding is a highly effective method and, therefore, commonly used in crop breeding to develop determinate plant types. The fruitful accomplishment of any mutation breeding program relies on an intelligent choice of mutagen and dosage optimization. In the present study, a rigorous screening was carried out to optimize the mutagenic dose, and thereby more desirable mutants were obtained. The screening for optimal doses was carried out by three different methods viz., roll-towel method, protray method, and field condition. The calculated LD50 values for gamma rays treated P 152 population was around 250 Gy to\ngrowth and short peduncle length; (M) Whole plant TFL mutant with determinate growth habit with extended peduncle length.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295509.g001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295509.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295509 December 14, 2023 11 / 20\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295509.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295509 December 14, 2023 12 / 20\n300 Gy. These results are consistent with the reports of Gnankambary, Batieno [48], who described that dose of 250 Gy to 300 Gy in cowpea. In M1 and M2 generation, the effect of mutagens on biological damages based on mortality, sterility, and injury was observed. The considerable variation in the mean and range of various morphological traits in the M2 generation offers great scope for the development of new plant types in cowpea improvement programs. Moreover, most of the viable mutants identified in the M2 generation failed to inherit in later generations as the characters were highly influenced by the environment. In contrast, the TFL mutants identified in the study (200 Gy gamma rays) exhibited a high degree of stability and is governed by a single recessive gene [49,50]. The high heritability coupled with high genetic advance percent means witnessed in the M5 generation of mutants indicated that the traits were fixed.\nThe TFL mutant also possessed a few modifications in the morphological traits compared\nto wild plant types. Reduction in morphological traits viz., plant height, duration, hundred seed weight, pod length, number of seeds per pod, internodal length, and number of leaves were observed in TFL mutants as compared to the wild type. These results are similar to previous results Alvarez, Guli [51]; Krylova, Burlyaeva [52]. On the other hand, there was an increase in peduncle length, number of pods per cluster, and number of pods per plant in the TFL mutants as compared to the wild type. This may be due to the fact that the randomness of mutation in some other genes in addition to the TFL1 gene would have resulted in phenotypic differences. The TFL mutants observed in the present investigation exhibited lesser single plant yield compared to the wild type. Even though the decline in single plant yield was witnessed in TFL/determinate plant type, it is expected to yield on par with the indeterminate/ wild type plants owing to its suitability for high-density plantation [53]. Compared to the TFL mutant identified by Dhanasekar and Reddy [5], the mutants identified in the study had higher plant height and longer peduncle length which makes the mechanical harvest easier.\nThe evolution of mutation breeding over the years from conventional induced mutagenesis\nto TILLING, genome editing, and MutMap is mind-boggling. MutMap is a recent and advanced technology that combines mutation breeding, hybridization, and second and thirdgeneration sequencing technologies. Mutmap had the advantage of detecting the QTLs, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), and candidate genes associated with trait modifications [54]. The TFL mutants (female) identified in the present study were crossed with the wild type (P 152 as male). In the MF1 generation, plants showing indeterminate types (True F1\u2019s) were selected and allowed to self-pollinate. The segregation of 3 indeterminate: 1 determinate types in MF2 generation suggested the trait to be under the governance of a single recessive gene for TFL in cowpea. [55] reported that VuTFL1 is the candidate gene responsible for the TFL type in cowpea, and also this gene family was well established in Arabidopsis [56], peas [28] and soybean [57]. In the present study, the VuTFL1 gene was sequenced in mutants and wild-type plants. The multiple sequence alignments of the VuTFL1 gene (1291 bp) revealed five SNPs across the mutant lines of which four SNPs were found to be in different introns, while A to T transversion at 1196 bp was in the exon of all TFL mutants. All the TFL mutants obtained from the study were derived from a single M1 plant. Hence, the same SNP might be obtained"

Likewise, three-point mutations at the same position of PsTFL1a were observed in two determinate mutants in peas by Foucher [22]. Similarly, the mutation on the fourth exon of TFL1 gene homologs was reported in lablab and soybean by Kaldate, Patel [58] and Liu, Watanabe [57]. On the other hand, Dhanasekar and Reddy [5] reported a point mutation at 1176 bp of VuTFL1 that led to the development of TFL mutants in cowpea. Both TFL1 and FT genes were found to be highly conserved across the organisms [59,60]. The point mutation on highly conserved regions might alter the protein sequence and consecutively results in a phenotypic change. Hence, it is worth estimating the effect of mutation on proteins [61]. Translational and functional genomics in cowpea is restricted because of its recalcitrant nature during genetic transformation. Hence, the bioinformatics tools offer a great deal of in silico clarifications on protein function and structure [62]. In the current study, Soft berry\u2019s FGENESH predicted the TFL protein in mutants and control to be 173 amino acids long. An amino acid change from asparagine (N) to tyrosine (Y) was found on the 143rd position of protein and that corresponds to the fourth exon of TFL mutants. Similarly, Ahn, Miller [23] reported that a functional mutation in the fourth exon provides the greater plasticity for the conversion of indeterminate to determinate plant types.\nAlthough genome sequencing provides the variation at nucleotide and amino acid sequence\nlevels, the biological function of that variation can be retrieved through the protein structure and function analysis [63]. The 3D protein structure of an unknown target was predicted based on one or more proteins of known structures called templates [64]. PDB BLAST retrieved the template structure of the 1wkoA chain, as it has 100% query coverage and more than 78% sequence identity to the VuTFL1 gene. Likewise, Danilevskaya, Meng [65] employed the 1wkoA chain as a template during the structure prediction of TFL/FT genes in maize. The protein model was built using MODELER Accelrys discovery studio with the lowest DOPE score and protein structure of wild type and TFL mutants were super imposed and compared. Mutation in TFL type leads to the modification of the external loop of beta-sheet with less than one percent of residues in the disallowed region. The modification in secondary structure and the external adjacent loop formation were noticed due to amino acid residues 139\u2013144 of the TFL1 gene [66]. These modifications in the external loop of beta-sheets would have suppressed the expression of a VuTFL1 gene and resulted in TFL/determinate mutants. KEGG orthology predicted the VuTFL1 gene belonged to phosphatidyl ethanolamine binding protein (PEBP). It is an ancient protein family found across the biosphere and plays a vital role in flower regulation [67].\nUnderstanding the effect of point mutation on the phenotype of the plant via alteration of\namino acid sequence and function is of significant interest in plant breeding. The evolutionary conservation of an amino (or nucleic) acid position is greatly influenced by its structural and functional relevance; rapidly evolving positions are unstable, whereas slowly evolving positions are conserved. Hence, the studies on conservation assessment of position highlight the importance of each position for the structure or function of the proteins. Flanagan, Patch [61] reported that 88% of the mutations disrupt highly conserved residues. In the present study, protein stability/function was predicted using eight online tools. Sequence homology-based method to predict the protein damage triggered by random mutations can be applied across organisms [68]. A loss in protein function, destabilization of protein, loss of catalytic site, and gain of sulfation were witnessed as a result of amino acid substitution in various prediction tools with a confidence score of 40% to 82%. A mutation in TFL1 with a functional loss would result in the conversion of SAM into a terminal flower [21,22]. KEGG orthology prognosticated that mutant/SNP will affect the biological function of PEBP by negative regulation of the TFL1 gene. It also affects molecular function i.e., transcription co-regulator activity in PEBP. The feasibility of mutation in inducing the TFL in cowpea has been previously manifested by\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0295509 December 14, 2023 15 / 20\nDhanasekar and Reddy [5] and Pandey and Dhanasekar [69]. The TFL1 gene plays a major role in determining the plant architecture. Overexpression of the TFL1 boosts the SAM and leads to indeterminate growth habit. On the other hand, loss of function exhausts the SAM and promotes TFL in crop plants [70]. In the present study, expression analysis revealed the down-regulation of VuTFL1 gene at V4, R5 and R7 stages of TFL cowpea mutants. The mutation of VuTFL1 gene leads to down-regulation or loss of function of PEBP and aligns well with the recessive inheritance of determinate growth habit [28]. Hence, loss of function mutation of VuTFL1 gene and PEBP induced through 200 Gy of gamma rays in the study arrested the SAM and induced TFL growth habit in cowpea mutants.\nIn conclusion, the identification of allelic variations within genes related to growth habits\nholds the potential to illuminate the molecular mechanisms underlying the crop ideotype. This comprehension, in turn, has the potential to lay the groundwork for modifying growth patterns. The findings of this study suggest that the loss of function in the VuTFL1 gene in cowpea adversely affects vegetative growth while promoting the TFL growth habit. The stable TFL mutants generated in this research hold promise for advancing innovative determinate cowpea cultivars, which could address challenges in intercultural and other cultivation practices while facilitating mechanical harvesting. This study serves as an exemplary demonstration of successfully integrating traditional induced mutagenesis with genomics to reshape plant architecture, thereby facilitating the development of nutritious and climate-resilient crops. Furthermore, our investigation introduces the viability of enhanced MutMap techniques within pulse crops for the first time. This exploration also offers the potential to extend the application of this technique to other enhancement initiatives involving pulse crops."
