    "abstractText": "The large-photon-number quantum state is a fundamental but nonresolved request for practical quantum information applications. We propose an N-photon state generation scheme that is feasible and scalable, using lithium niobate on insulator circuits. Such a scheme is based on the integration of a common building block called photon-number doubling unit (PDU) for deterministic single-photon parametric downconversion and upconversion. The PDU relies on a 107-optical-quality-factor resonator and mW-level on-chip power, which is within the current fabrication and experimental limits. N-photon state generation schemes, with cluster and Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013Zeilinger state as examples, are shown for different quantum tasks.",

Benefiting from the superposition of an N-qubit state, quantum source further boosts the information exponentially over an N-bit classical source.11 In fact, a 300-qubit quantum state has more variations than all the atoms in the known universe classically.12,13 However, generation of large-size quantum states is a fundamental challenge, whether for electrical or optical systems. Although the strong interacting particles, such as superconductivity electrons and ions, make\nit easier to generate large-size quantum states and keep the current record of the qubit number;14\u201316 their strong interaction also leads to the decoherence problem and can only work in an ultralow temperature and vacuum environment. These electrical quantum sources still suffer from a short-state lifetime even under these conditions.\nOn the other hand, photons are known for their weak interaction, where long coherence time can be achieved even at room temperature, which makes them suitable for \u201cflying qubits\u201d applications.17\u201321 However, they have not been considered as a good candidate to build a large-size quantum source due to their weak interaction in the normal medium. A nonlinear optical medium is by far the most effective way to establish interaction between photons. Using spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC)22 or spontaneous four-wave mixing,23 two-photon states can be generated directly but only probabilistically. However, it is still an interesting topic for the generation of N-photon states. Much effort has been devoted for their nondeterministic generation such as postselection with multiple SPDC from the same pump source24 or cascaded SPDC,25,26 though the generation rate decreases exponentially as the photon *Address all correspondence to Hua-Ying Liu, liuhuaying@nju.edu.cn; Yan-Xiao Gong, gongyanxiao@nju.edu.cn; Zhenda Xie, xiezhenda@nju.edu.cn \u2020These authors contributed equally to this work.\nAdvanced Photonics Nexus 016003-1 Jan\u2215Feb 2023 \u2022 Vol. 2(1) Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Advanced-Photonics-Nexus on 18 Jan 2024 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nnumber increases in these studies. An ultimate solution is realizing deterministic two-photon state generation, and then a deterministic N-photon state can be achieved by cascading the two-photon processes. Such a concept has been proposed and theoretically studied, however, only with the ideal \u03c7\u00f02\u00de27 or \u03c7\u00f03\u00de28 material assumption.\nHere we propose the first feasible scheme to deterministically generate an N-photon state, considering the practical material capability. Such a scheme is based on an ensemble of basic units called photon-number doubling units (PDUs) that is used to realize photon number doubling and keep their spectrum unchanged at the same time. This unit is capable of deterministic parametric downconversion (DPDC) and deterministic parametric upconversion (DPUC). Taking advantage of the strong nonlinear interaction in lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) circuits,29\u201335 this PDU only requires a LNOI resonator with an \u223c107 optical quality factor (Q factor) and a mW-level on-chip power, which have already been demonstrated in experiments.36,37 With a miniaturized footprint in LNOI, PDUs can be integrated for unlimited photon numbers in principle on a single chip. Therefore, our scheme may fulfill the fundamental demand for scalable large-size quantum state generation as examples discussed here for cluster and Greenberger\u2013Horne\u2013 Zeilinger (GHZ) state generation."

            "text": "In general, an N-photon state can be generated by cascading two-photon generation processes, either via \u03c7\u00f02\u00de or \u03c7\u00f03\u00de nonlinearity.28 Here we choose the LNOI circuit to realize \u03c7\u00f02\u00de parametric downconversion (PDC) with unitary efficiency because of its high nonlinearity, 34,37,38 low propagation loss,39 and strong mode confinement.40 As shown in Fig. 1, the photon number can be scaled using a standard PDU. Photon number doubling can be achieved using DPDC, while it is also necessary to include a DPUC unit for frequency upconversion so that the wavelengths remain unchanged after each step of the PDU. The DPUC resolves the problem of the increasing photon wavelengths as the DPDC processes cascade, and the long wavelength exceeds the transparency window of materials eventually and raises challenges for single-photon detector technology. With the photon wavelength unchanged, we can use a standard design as a fundamental building block for all PDUs at different stages, which is important for scalable photonic integration.\nThe practical layout of each PDU can be illustrated in Fig. 2(a), in the form of LNOI circuits. We choose a quasiphasematched high-Q microring resonator for the DPDC process. The reason is twofold. First, the microring resonator can greatly enhance the photon interaction in a small footprint, and our modeling and calculation shows that DPDC can be achieved, considering the ultrahigh nonlinearity in the LNOI. Second, the cavity enhancement can keep the single-photon spectra unbroadened with a proper resonator design, while in the case of a nonresonant parametric downconversion process, the photon bandwidth is determined only by the phase-matching bandwidth, which is normally on the order of hundreds of GHz.41,42 It is a fundamental challenge to manage the phase matching over such increasingly broadened photon bandwidths.\nIn our layout, the DPDC is nondegenerate in frequency so that the signal and idler photons can be separated by the on-chip wavelength division multiplexing (WDM1) device. Such WDM devices have been reported in the LNOI using different designs\nincluding a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer43 and a multimode interferometer.44 Then the parametric photons enter centimeterlong periodically poled LNOI (PPLNOI) spiral waveguides for the DPUC. With a LNOI waveguide of such length, our calculation shows that unitary upconversion efficiency can be achieved via a sum-frequency generation (SFG) process with a single-mode SFG laser and only mW-level continue-wave power. Different SFG laser wavelengths are chosen for the signal and idler photons so that they are up-converted to the same wavelength as the pump before entering the PDUs in the next stage. The residue SFG laser is rejected using WDM2/WDM3 from the up-converted single/idler photons, respectively, and may be reused to up-convert the single/idler photons PDUs in the next stage. Only two SFG laser wavelengths are required over the whole N-photon generation chip that greatly simplify the setup. An N-photon state generation can be achieved by the integration of these PDUs, and the example in Fig. 2(b) shows the Fock state generation by direct cascading PDUs."

Also, L and nj correspond to the length of the microring resonator and the effective refractive index of photon j, respectively.\nTo have unbroadened spectra for N-photon state generation, single-longitude-mode (SLM) oscillation must be achieved in this cavity-enhanced case, which requires the difference of the free spectrum range of the signal and idler light to be larger than the linewidth of the cavity resonances.48,49 Such a condition is easily satisfied in the high-Q case, where such a highQ-factor is also necessary for the high efficiency as required by the DPDC on the other hand. At a certain resonator size and dispersion, the Q requirement of SLM oscillation can be derived as (see details in Sec.

Here we model the DPDC as a one-dimensional interaction following the propagation of pump, signal, and idler photons, where the coupling point is marked in red for z \u00bc 0. The coordinate in the resonator z varies between 0 and L, where L is the resonator length.

As expected, a smaller resonator size and larger dispersion can relax the requirement of Q for SLM oscillation. Assuming a crosssection structure with a 60 deg wall slope following the normal LNOI fabrication technique36,50,51 [inset of Fig. 3(b), and such a cross-section is used for all the following simulations] and a mirroring radius of 30 \u03bcm, SLM oscillation can be achieved when Q > 2.7 \u00d7 104, for the PDC process 646.91 nm \u2192 1276.80 nm + 1311.29 nm. In real experiments, the triply resonant condition needs to be fulfilled for the PDC process, and it can be achieved if longitudinal modes can be matched for the pump, signal, and idler lights, and the pump photon frequency is matched to the pump longitudinal mode. That is, \u03c9m \u00bc \u03c9n \u00fe \u03c9q, where \u03c9m, \u03c9n, and \u03c9q are the central frequencies of longitudinal modes of the resonator for pump, signal, and idler, respectively. In practice, the longitudinal mode matching can be achieved via temperature or electro-optic tuning of the PPLNOI microring,50,52 and the pump photon frequency needs to be tuned, either via the initial generation process, or the SFG laser frequency in the cascade SFG process.\nUnder the SLM oscillation condition, it is reasonable to narrow the integration range for kj in Eq.

With single-photon pump input j1ip \u00bc \u03c2\u0302\u2020pj0i, the time-independent Hamiltonian in Eq. (6) can be derived (see Sec.

The efficiency for the single photon PDC, i.e., the probability that a pump photon is converted to a signal or an idler photon, is thus\n\u03b7PDC \u00bc sin2 2\u03c0\u03beQ \u03c9 : (9)\nTherefore, unitary conversion efficiency can be achieved when Q is high enough.\nTaking the 30-\u03bcm radius LNOI microring resonator as an example, we calculate the required Q value for DPDC (see Sec. E in the Supplementary Material for more details). Such a radius is chosen for a modeling with the LNOI microring on the SiO2 buried oxide layer, and the bending loss induced Q limit is still over 9.89 \u00d7 108. Following Eq. (7), we first obtain \u03be by calculating the refractive indices nj0, wave vectors kj0, effective spatial overlap Aeff , and mode area Aj for different wavelengths. Substituting \u03be into Eq. (9), we obtain the relation between Q and \u03b7PDC under different wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 3(a). For example, for the PDC process 646.91 nm \u2192 1276.80 nm + 1311.29 nm, DPDC can be achieved with a relatively low Q of 4.11 \u00d7 107 at 1311.29 nm, which is experimentally feasible considering the Q over 108 for the LNOI resonator in experiments.34,40,54 We also calculate the required Q for DPDC under different microring radii R, the results are shown in Fig. 3(b).\nWe assume a lossless model in the above discussion, and this assumption stands when the loss-induced Q is much higher than the required Q as discussed here. Considering the current material-absorption-limit Q of over 3 \u00d7 108,55 the 42.2% total conversion efficiency is expected, which can be further reduced by the fabrication technique improvement (see Sec.

Such power can be achieved by a laser diode directly, hence exempting the need for Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers.

Such scheme, utilizing the high-nonlinearity LNOI circuit, makes large-size quantum state generation experimentally feasible for the first time to our knowledge. The key component in the design is an ensemble of scalable standard basic units called PDUs. Based on our calculation, in the unit, DPDC and DPUC can be achieved with \u223c4 \u00d7 107 Q-factor microring resonators, 1-cm-long waveguides and 8-mW SFG powers in this unit, respectively.

The strong field confinement of the LNOI also enables a small PDU footprint for the potential large-scale integration, paving the route to the large photon number generation on a single chip.
