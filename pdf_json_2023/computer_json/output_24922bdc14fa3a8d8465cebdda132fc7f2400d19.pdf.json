    "abstractText": "The ability to modify morphology in response to environmental changes represents a highly advantageous feature in biological organisms, facilitating their adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. While some robots have the capability to modify their morphology by utilizing adaptive body parts, the practical implementation of morphological transformations in robotic systems is still relatively restricted. This limitation can be attributed, in part, to the intricate nature of achieving such transformations, which necessitates the integration of advanced materials, control systems, and design approaches. In nature, a range of morphology adaptation strategies is employed to achieve optimal performance and efficiency, such as those employed by crocodiles and alligators, who adjust their body posture depending on the speed and the surface they traverse on. Drawing inspiration from these biological examples, this paper introduces Adjustbot, a quadruped robot with an undulating body capable of adjusting its body posture. Its adaptive morphology allows it to traverse a wide range of terradynamically challenging surfaces and facilitates avoidance of collisions, navigation through narrow channels, obstacle traversal, and incline negotiation.",

INTRODUCTION A biological creature\u2019s capacity to adapt to a variety of environments is greatly facilitated by morphological changes that increase its robustness [1], [2], [3]. The creatures adopt many different kinds of morphological changes to adapt themselves to the changing environment [4]. Pigeons are known to use a strategy of folding their wings in order to navigate through obstacles [5]. Also, to fly more efficiently and conserve energy, bats, and birds constantly fold and unfold their wings [6]. In addition to avoiding obstacles, several species of creatures like caterpillars [7] and salamanders [8], coil their bodies like a wheel and roll to avoid the predators.\nMorphological changes during locomotion are also observable in legged animals such as crocodiles and alligators, as these creatures exhibit the ability to modify their body posture in response to the speed and surface conditions of their locomotion. For instance, when walking at slower speeds on wet and muddy surfaces, crocodiles adopt a sprawled posture [9]. Semi-erect posture is used to walk with higher speeds on dry surfaces [9]. Figure 1 shows the semi-erect and sprawl postures of a crocodile. Zoologists generally classify postures found in vertebrates into three types: sprawling, semi-erect, and erect on the basis of the sidewise relative movement of the femur from the body [9]. Mammals like humans, dogs, cats, cows, and horses, to name a few have mostly erect posture [9] whereas salamanders and geckos have a sprawling posture [10].\n*Corresponding author, email:yozkanay@nd.edu Both authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University\nof Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA\nSimilar to biological systems, many researchers have developed robots with adaptive and re-configurable body parts to enhance their functionalities [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Moreover, adaptive behavior leads to the simplification of control [23] and robot design [24]. The mobile robot of Li et al. [17] has a transformable body that allows it to move both in open areas and narrow channels. Jiang et al. [25] make use of a balance-rocker mechanism which helps the robot to change its posture and adapt to different terrain conditions. Similarly, the six-wheeled mobile robot of Song et al. [19] makes use of a Sarrus-variant mechanism to reconfigure the robot body for terrain adaptability and obstacle crossing. Zheng et al. [20] use an adaptive wheel for multi-terrain locomotion. In the robot of Chou and Yang [16], the robot body folds and unfolds itself to switch between wheel mode and claw mode. The amphibious robot of Liang et al. [26] uses an adaptive propulsion mechanism wherein the mechanism switches between leg and flipper to move on the surface and underwater, respectively. Baines et al. [27] use a morphing limb in their bio-inspired amphibious robot. The morphing limb transitions between a flipper for swimming and a leg for walking. Unmanned aerial systems are also increasingly becoming transformable as they enhance the maneuverability and agility of such systems [13]. Some robots also change their posture to navigate through confined spaces [28], [22]. Certain quadruped robots have a bio-inspired laterally undulating adaptive spine or backbone, which helps them not just in their locomotion [10], [29], [30] but also for energy-efficient climbing [31].\nAs variable morphology enhances the functionalities of both biological and engineering systems, the present paper comes up with an adjustable posture and laterally undulating bio-inspired quadruped robot, Adjustbot for terradynamically demanding situations. The majority of currently available quadruped robots [32], [33], [34], [35], [36] lack bio-inspired features like changeable posture [9] or lateral undulation [10] and have stiff bodies, which prevent them from becoming more robust in accordance with biological notions. Previously, there\nar X\niv :2\n30 9.\n10 13\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 1\n8 Se\np 20\n23\nhave been posture-changing quadruped robots, like in the work of Bongard [1], Ansari et al. [37], and, Jua\u0301rez-Campos et al. [38]. However, the robot developed by Bongard [1] uses a series of gears in a gear train to actuate the posture change, and also it uses legs that act as stands. The quadruped robot of Ansari et al. [37] uses soft legs for posture change. Jua\u0301rezCampos et al. [38] make use of Peaucellier\u2013Lipkin mechanism in their robot to effect posture change. The performance of these robots is unknown as they were not tested extensively in unstructured environments.\nAdjustbot, the robot under study, is a three-dimensional (3D) printed, quadruped robot equipped with seven servo motors, each serving a distinct purpose (See Fig.1 B, D, and Fig.2). The rotational motion of its C-shaped legs is facilitated by four servo motors. Additionally, two servo motors, in conjunction with a gear drive mechanism, enable posturechanging capabilities, while one servo motor facilitates lateral undulation of the robot\u2019s body.\nThe research presented in this paper represents a significant contribution to the field, as it highlights and substantiates, through experimental validation, the crucial role of morphology change in bio-inspired quadruped robots when navigating\nchallenging, unstructured environments. By allowing for dynamic posture adjustments, these robots demonstrate a higher capacity to adapt to unfamiliar surroundings, making them particularly suitable for applications such as search and rescue operations during natural disasters.\nThe rest of the letter is organized as follows: Section II provides a summary of the components and procedures utilized to design, manufacture, and control the robot. Section III discusses stability and gait selection through bio-inspiration. The experimental results are discussed in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes the letter."

            "text": "The 3D computer-aided design (CAD) model of the robot is shown in Fig. 2. The robot has eight axes of rotation, which are denoted by zi,i=1,2,3,...,8. z1, z2, z3, and z4 correspond to the axes of rotation of the C-shaped legs. z5 and z6 correspond to the axes of rotation of the two posture change mechanisms that are located at the front and back segments of the robot. z7 and z8 correspond to the pitch and yaw motions of the robot body, respectively. The yaw motion corresponds to the lateral\nundulation of the robot body. It may be noted that z5 and z6 correspond to a single degree of freedom as the two posture change mechanisms do not have motion relative to each other.\nHowever, it is important to highlight that, in the context of this study, the robot\u2019s body pitch motion is not utilized. The motor corresponding to the z7 axis is initialized at a zerodegree angle, as indicated in Fig. 2, and remains fixed at zero degrees throughout the robot\u2019s operation. Consequently, the robot has six degrees of freedom, with four associated with the C-shaped legs, one with the two posture change mechanisms, and one with the lateral undulation of the robot.\nThe posture change mechanism consists of two parallelogram mechanisms [39] which are synchronously operated by a single motor with the help of a gear drive. The opposite links in the parallelogram mechanism are of the same length. In the parallelogram, the length of the link with gear is the longest (60 mm). The length of the portion of the link between the two longest links is 44.5 mm and the entire length of this link is 104.5 mm. For the gear drive, both the gears have a pitch circle diameter of 15 mm and a module (the ratio of the pitch diameter of the gear to its number of teeth) of 1 [40]. The range of the posture angle, \u03b8 is between +40\u25e6 and -60\u25e6.\nThe parts of the robot have been modeled in Solidworks 2022. The two most important design parameters of the robot are: d and H, as indicated in Fig. 2 C. d and H depend on the dimensions of the links in the parallelogram mechanism and the posture angle, \u03b8. Hence, the dimensions of the links in the parallelogram mechanism have been chosen in a way that d and H have a range of 30 mm and 60 mm, respectively, as\nindicated in Table I. The selected dimensions of the links in the posture change mechanism also ensure that \u03b8 has a range of 100 \u25e6. The dimensions of the links, including the range of posture change mechanisms for the smooth functioning of the robot without any interference between the links and the parts, have been selected by using GeoGebra and \u201canimation, basic motion, and motion analysis\u201d options in Solidworks 2022. Similarly, while designing the body of the robot, it is ensured that the amplitude of the body angle, \u03b1 has a range of at least 60\u25e6 for each of the postures of the robot. It may be noted that the maximum \u03b1 for each of the 40, 0, and -60 degree postures of the robot without any interference between the limbs and the body are 70, 60, and 75 degrees, respectively. The robot has C-shaped legs as these legs provide a fair trade-off between the enhanced mobility of legged robots and the sturdy stability of wheels [41], [42]. The inner and outer diameter of the Cshaped legs are 30mm and 35mm, respectively. These legs make sure that h has a minimum value of 25 mm at \u03b8 = +40\u25e6 posture. The front body of the robot, from z8 axis to the front face along the longitudinal axis is 70mm long. Thus, the front body of the robot rotates by an angle \u03b1 with a radius of 7070mm. The dimension has been chosen such that the robot has at least an \u03b1 of \u00b160\u25e6 for all the possible postures of the robot.\nWhile a power source is employed for powering the robot, we also integrated a battery box into the central section of the robot, as illustrated in Figure 2, with the intention of facilitating future autonomous locomotion capabilities."

Each of the motors is independently controlled using Robotis U2D2. U2D2 is assembled in the U2D2 Power Hub board, which is powered by a DC supply of 11 V. A program is written in Matlab R2022b and is fed to U2D2 in real time to control each of\nthe axes of the robot independently. The system architecture of the robot is shown in Fig. 3. The entire control system is open-loop. In the system architecture, a voltage regulator is also used as the recommended voltage of Dynamixel XL330M288-T is 5 V.\nThe control program for the robot is written in MATLAB 2022 using the Robotis Dynamixel SDK Matlab library [43]. In this study, we have configured the operating mode of the leg and body servos to utilize the extended position control mode. This mode enables the legs to rotate beyond 2\u03c0 in either direction and facilitates the synchronous movement of the robot body with the legs. Regarding the two posture change mechanisms, we have employed the position control mode for both motors. This allows precise control over the positioning of the mechanisms throughout the robot\u2019s operation."

            "heading": "III. STABILITY AND GAIT SELECTION",
            "text": "To maintain static stability throughout the robot\u2019s walking motion, it is essential to ensure that the vertical projection of the robot\u2019s center of gravity consistently remains within the support pattern (a polygon formed by connecting the leg contact points of the robot[44]).\nIn the context of gait patterns, a lateral sequence gait is characterized by the hind foot of a quadruped making initial ground contact, followed by the forefoot on the same side of the body, according to Hildebrand [45]. Meanwhile, a creeping gait implies that a minimum of three feet maintain contact with the ground consistently [44].\nIn this paper, we adopted the lateral sequence creeping gait due to its capacity to facilitate low-speed locomotion while ensuring stability for the quadruped throughout the majority of the locomotion cycle (Fig. 4). This choice stems from the\nfact that a creeping gait, as described in [46], guarantees a positive static stability margin across the majority of the gait cycle [44]. Furthermore, we selected the lateral sequence gait [45] in light of its advantages: (1) the area enclosed by the support triangle is greater than that enclosed by the support triangle for a diagonal sequence gait [47] and (2) a lateral sequence gait helps in the lateral undulation of a quadruped [48].\nSolidworks is used to validate the stability of the robot, incorporating a lateral sequence creeping gait in conjunction with a laterally undulating back. The stability margins of the robot for different body angles, \u03b1, and posture angles, \u03b8, during a cycle are obtained using Solidworks. These values are then utilized to generate the contour plot depicted in Fig. 5. For all the postures, the stability margins are the greatest for steps 1, 2, 9, and 15, when the four legs touch the ground. The stability margins are positive for all the steps except for steps 7, 8, and 14. During these steps, the foreleg remains in the air and the robot has a tendency to fall in the forward direction. However, before the robot body could fall and touch the ground, the foreleg completes its rotation and touches the ground first. Due to this, the robot regains its stability. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that in the immediate step after steps 8 and 14, the four legs maintain contact with the ground and the stability margin becomes greatly positive from negative.\nThe gait diagram [49] and the sequence of motion of the legs and the body angle for the lateral sequence gait are shown in Fig. 6. From Figs. 4 and 6, it can be seen that each of the legs remains in the air for the same amount of time (25%) during a cycle while the other three legs are in contact with the ground. Hence, according to Hildebrand\u2019s gait formula, the robot uses a symmetrical gait and has a gait formula of (75,25) [45]. Here,\nthe first variable corresponds to the percentage of time that each hind foot is on the ground during a cycle or stride (duty cycle) and the second variable corresponds to the percentage of time when a forefoot falls on the ground behind a hind foot on the same side of the body during a stride (relative phase) [45], [50]. McGhee [50] generalizes Hildebrand\u2019s gait formula to include the duty factor of each of the legs of a quadruped and the relative phases of any three legs, with respect to a chosen fourth leg. According to McGhee\u2019s gait formula [50], g our gait is given as\ng = (0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.5, 0.75, 0.25)T (1)\nIn the above formula, the first four variables correspond to the duty factors of the first, second, third, and fourth legs. The remaining three variables correspond to the relative phases of the second, third, and fourth legs with respect to the first leg. This gait formula can be calculated from the gait matrix, G, and the duration vector, t [50] for the robot. For writing G and t, the legs have been numbered as shown in Fig. 4. The matrix G comprises four columns, representing the four legs of the robot, while the total number of rows is equal to the length of\none cycle of the gait sequence[50]. The values within G are binary, with 0 indicating a leg in contact with the ground and 1 indicating a leg lifted into the air [50].\nG =  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0  , t =  0 T/4 0 T/4 0 T/4 0 T/4  (2)\nin Eq. 2, T is the stride duration. The gait formula in Eq. 1 gives information only about the duty factor and relative phases of the legs. A quadruped robot\u2019s supporting feet position and vertical center of gravity projection, along with its duty factor and relative phases, are all completely specified by a kinematic gait formula [44]. The kinematic gait formula of the robot for \u03b8 = 40\u25e6, 0\u25e6 and, -60\u25e6 with \u03b1 = 0\u25e6 for each of them are given as-\nk40\u25e6 =(0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.681, 0.681,\u22120.509,\u22120.509, 0.479,\u22120.472, 0.479,\u22120.472, 0.5, 0.75, 0.25)T\nk0\u25e6 =(0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.564, 0.564,\u22120.421,\u22120.421, 0.467,\u22120.467, 0.467,\u22120.467, 0.5, 0.75, 0.25)T\nk\u221260\u25e6 =(0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.509, 0.509,\u22120.381,\u22120.381, 0.289,\u22120.284, 0.289,\u22120.284, 0.5, 0.75, 0.25)T\n(3)\nIn the above formula, the first four and the last three variables denote the duty factors and the relative phases of the legs, respectively. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth variables correspond to the x-coordinate, and the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth variables correspond to the y-coordinate of the dimensionless initial foot position of the legs of the robot. The origin lies at the center of gravity of the robot with the x-axis pointing towards the direction of motion of the robot, and the y-axis is pointing ninety degrees to the left of the xaxis. The scale of the x and y coordinate axes is chosen such that stride length is equal to 1 [44].\nAs the duty factor of each of the legs is the same (0.75), which is also evident from Fig. 6 A, the gait of the robot\nwould be represented by Hildebrand\u2019s gait formula (75,25) throughout the text. The kinematic gait formula gives information about the foot positions and the stride length of the robot, which can be determined only after the robot completes one cycle of motion. The motion Analysis option in Solidworks was used to determine the initial foot positions and center of gravity for determining the kinematic gait formula (3) for the three postures of the robot. It may be noted that throughout the text, the robot makes use of only one gait. But there are different ways of representing the same gait. The robot here has a symmetrical gait and each of the legs has the same duty factor, hence Hildebrand\u2019s representation of the gait formula is sufficient with just two variables. The kinematic gait formula is much more informative but it can be calculated only after knowing the robot\u2019s initial foot positions and stride length, which vary for different postures. But across all the postures, the robot\u2019s gait formula with Hildebrand\u2019s representation remains fixed at (75,25)."

            "text": "The robot\u2019s locomotion was assessed across diverse postures during three walking cycles on distinct flat surfaces, each featuring varying levels of roughness (Fig. 7). These surfaces encompass a whiteboard, characterized by minimal roughness,\na foam mat with intermediate roughness, and a spiked plastic plate presenting the highest degree of roughness. Surface roughness levels were ascertained through visual inspection.\nThe robot\u2019s center of mass (CoM) motion was captured using the OptiTrack Motion Capture System for three specific postures: 40\u25e6, 0\u25e6, and -60\u25e6 on each of the three surfaces. These three postures are chosen because as mentioned in Section II, the posture angle, \u03b8 has minimum and maximum values of -60\u25e6 and 40\u25e6, respectively. The robot can attain any posture between these two values. For analysis, an intermediate posture of 0\u25e6 is also chosen. The motion of the robot was recorded for five trials starting from the same initial position. The mean and standard deviation (SD) values of the captured motion are shown in Fig. 7 A. For -60\u25e6 posture, the displacement per cycle of the robot, as shown in Fig. 7 A is highest when it moves on the surface with the least roughness, followed by the\nsurfaces with intermediate and maximum roughness. This is because, during the robot\u2019s locomotion, the hind legs mostly slide forward (SI movie- 0:33 to 0:44). This sliding is smooth and fast if the surface is smooth. As the surface gets rough, the hind legs tend to get stuck in the mechanical asperities as they move forward and hence the sliding is not smooth and fast. Similar to -60\u25e6 posture, the displacement per cycle follows a pattern for 40\u25e6 and 0\u25e6 postures, when the robot moves on surfaces with least and intermediate roughness, as shown in Fig. 7 A. However, contrary to -60\u25e6 posture, the robot\u2019s displacement per cycle for the 40\u25e6 and 0\u25e6 postures becomes the greatest when it moves on the surface with maximum roughness. This is because during the locomotion, when the hind legs get stuck, another phenomenon happens. The robot body tends to fall forward and the suspended foreleg touches the ground before it is able to complete the full 2\u03c0 revolution (SI movie- 0:08 to 0:32). When this happens, the robot covers a greater distance in a single cycle.\nIdeally, the displacement per cycle of the robot, irrespective of the surface it walks on, should have been the highest for 0\u25e6 posture followed by 40\u25e6 and -60\u25e6 postures. This is because, at 0\u25e6 posture, d (Table I) is highest, hence the arc length subtended by the front body of the robot during lateral undulation is greatest and it covers a greater distance. At -60\u25e6 posture, d (Table I) is least and hence the arc length subtended by the body servo is less.\nThus, three cases may arise when the hind legs of the robot tend to get stuck, which is why the displacements don\u2019t match up with the ideal displacements. In the first case, the hind leg will get past that asperity after getting stuck initially but this will lead to a decrease in displacement per cycle. In the second case, the robot will tend to fall forward and the foreleg will touch the ground before it completes a full 2\u03c0 revolution. In the third case, the robot will deviate from its straight line path and its trajectory will bend, which will contribute to the robot\u2019s lateral displacement, leading to a reduction in displacement per cycle of the robot, as shown in Figs. 7 B,C, and D. The robot\u2019s locomotion may fall under any of these three cases and hence the displacement per cycle will vary."

            "text": "Several trials were conducted to assess the robot\u2019s ability to navigate through different widths of channels (Fig. 8) without and with adjusting its posture. As shown in Table I, the robot\u2019s width is at its maximum (d = 202 mm) when the posture is set to 0\u25e6. Conversely, at a posture of -60\u25e6, the robot\u2019s width is at its minimum (d = 150 mm). The robot attempted to enter the narrower channel (width = 195 mm) after walking in a wider channel (width = 330 mm) with a fixed posture of 0\u25e6. However, this experiment was unsuccessful, as the robot collided with the side walls upon entering the narrower channel (SI movie- 1:06 to 1:16). Following the collision, the robot either remained stationary, attempting to enter the narrow channel or lost its stability and fell down. Alternatively, the robot was tested by initially moving through a broader channel with a fixed posture of 0\u25e6, and upon reaching the entry point of the narrower channel after completing one full cycle, the\n.\nrobot adjusted its posture from 0\u25e6 to -60\u25e6. Subsequently, the robot moved inside the narrower channel at a posture of - 60\u25e6 (SI movie- 0:48 to 1:05). This sequence of actions was replicated five times, and in each repetition, the experiment resulted in a consistently successful outcome. It is to be noted\nthat the robot does not make use of any obstacle-detecting sensor. Hence, while carrying out the experiments, the robot is placed at a pre-defined distance before the obstacle and the robot program is written in a way that the robot changes its posture after completing the pre-defined distance."

            "text": "Similar to the last experiment where the robot moved through a narrow channel, in this experiment, the robot goes through a tunnel of low height (200 mm) by avoiding collision with the roof of the tunnel. As can be seen in Table I, the maximum height of the robot is 240 mm and it attains this height when it has a posture of -60\u25e6. At 40\u25e6 posture, the robot\u2019s height is least at 180 mm. The robot walks at -60\u25e6 posture before entering the tunnel. In the experiments, the robot with -60\u25e6 posture completes two cycles and stops at the entry point of the tunnel, as shown in Fig. 9. At the entry point of the tunnel, the robot changes its posture from -60\u25e6 to 40\u25e6. In doing so, the robot\u2019s height gets reduced from 240 mm to 180 mm. Then, the robot at 40\u25e6 posture moves inside the tunnel fully by completing two cycles (SI movie- 1:17 to 1:35). This experiment is also carried out five times. Without the posture change, the robot collides with the tunnel, loses its stability, and falls (SI movie- 1:36 to 1:45). This experiment also highlights the importance of posture change in averting head-on collisions."

            "heading": "D. Obstacle Avoidance",
            "text": "This experiment attempts to show how changing the robot\u2019s posture can be an effective way to overcome obstacles of different sizes. By adjusting its posture, the robot can adapt to the shape and size of the obstacle on its path. It might not always be possible to circumvent obstacles, especially when the robot passes through a narrow tunnel with not enough space for the robot to go around. Hence, these experiments further validate the importance of adaptable morphology in robots. With posture change, the robot goes past the obstacle without changing its path.\nIn these experiments, the robot traverses a level ground surface encountering three randomly sized obstacles that are smaller than the maximum clearance of the robot body, as shown in Fig. 10. The first obstacle is a cube with an edge length of 38 mm. The second obstacle is also a cube with an edge length of 50 mm and is placed at a distance of 300 mm from the first obstacle. The third obstacle is a cuboid with a length of 100 mm, width and height each of 50 mm. It is placed at a distance of 350 mm from the second obstacle. The robot is placed at a distance of 200 mm ahead of the first obstacle. Due to the absence of obstacle-detecting sensors in the current version of the robot, the relative distance between the obstacles is manually selected to allow sufficient time for the robot to traverse each obstacle consecutively.\nAt the beginning of the experiment, the robot is at 40\u25e6 posture. From Table I, we know that the robot body\u2019s height from the ground, h = 25 mm when the robot is at 40\u25e6 posture. So, the robot after completing one cycle, stops in front of the second obstacle and changes its posture to 20\u25e6. At 20\u25e6\nposture, h=40 mm. The robot at 20\u25e6 posture overcomes the first obstacle in two cycles and stops in front of the second obstacle. It changes its posture to -40\u25e6 at which h=95 mm. The robot at -40\u25e6 posture overcomes the second obstacle in two cycles and stops in front of the third obstacle. It changes its posture to 0\u25e6 at which h=65 mm. To overcome the third obstacle, the robot could have moved with -40\u25e6 posture but at - 40\u25e6 posture, the distance between the legs is 140 mm. In order to increase the distance between the legs, the robot\u2019s posture is changed to 0\u25e6 in which the distance between the legs is 162 mm. The robot at 0\u25e6 posture overcomes the third obstacle by completing two cycles (SI movie- 1:46 to 2:17). Note that, the motion of the robot is open-loop, i.e. it was programmed to change its postures within a specific time step. This experiment is carried out five times with a successful outcome each time.\nIn order to demonstrate the necessity of posture changes for the robot to successfully navigate the obstacles, a supplementary set of control experiments was conducted. At 40\u25e6 posture, the robot body strikes the first obstacle. After that, upon encountering the obstacles, the robot\u2019s body remains stationary in its current position, either attempting to move forward or becoming immobilized with its legs suspended in the air, without establishing contact with the ground surface (SI movie- 2:18 to 2:32). In another experiment, the robot overcomes the first obstacle at 20\u25e6 posture and then tries to\novercome the second obstacle without changing its posture. Similar to the prior case, following the robot body\u2019s collision with the second obstacle, it exhibits behavior wherein the body remains stationary in an attempt to proceed, or it becomes immobilized atop the obstacle, with its legs suspended in the air and no ground contact established.\nHence, the posture change mechanism empowers the quadruped robot to dynamically adjust its body height above the ground and the inter-leg spacing in direct response to encountered obstacles within its trajectory. This ability to modulate posture facilitates enhanced adaptability and maneuverability when navigating through complex environments and contributes to the robot\u2019s agility and efficiency in negotiating obstacles effectively, thereby expanding its range of potential applications across diverse terrains and scenarios."

            "text": "In this experiment, the robot\u2019s stability is analyzed when it walks, both uphill and downhill, on 5\u25e6 and 10\u25e6 ramps. This experiment was considered important as in the previous subsections, the robot mostly moved on a flat surface while circumventing tunnels and obstacles through posture change. However, in real-world surroundings, the robot may need to walk through inclines and steep terrains with tunnels and rocks.\n1) Uphill: The robot walks for four cycles on a 5\u25e6 ramp with posture angle, \u03b8 =40\u25e6 and amplitude of body angle, \u03b1 =40\u25e6 without falling. However, with 0\u25e6 posture and 40\u25e6 amplitude, the robot is able to complete two full cycles and falls at the start of the third cycle (SI movie- 3:30 to 3:39).\nFor -60\u25e6 posture and 40\u25e6 body angle, the robot is unable to complete even one cycle and falls before that. Each of these experiments was carried out at least five times and similar observations were made each time.\nIn order to make the robot move for full four cycles with 0\u25e6 and -60\u25e6 postures on a 5\u25e6 ramp, \u03b1 of the robot is increased to 45\u25e6. With 45\u25e6 amplitude, the robot completes full four cycles on a 5\u25e6 ramp both with 0\u25e6 (SI movie- 3:39 to 3:54) and 40\u25e6 postures. However, with \u03b1 =45\u25e6 and \u03b8 =-60\u25e6, the robot is unable to complete even one cycle and falls. In order to make the robot move on a 5\u25e6 ramp with \u03b8 =-60\u25e6, \u03b1 is sequentially increased from 45\u25e6 to 75\u25e6 with an increment of 5\u25e6. The robot at \u03b8 =-60\u25e6 kept falling in the first cycle itself for different values of \u03b1 except when \u03b1 =70\u25e6. With \u03b8 =-60\u25e6 and \u03b1 =70\u25e6, the robot could walk for a full four cycles on the 5\u25e6 ramp without falling (SI movie- 2:33 to 2:47).\nNext, the robot walks on a 10\u25e6 ramp for four cycles. With \u03b8 =40\u25e6 and \u03b1 =40\u25e6, the robot is unable to climb and falls without completing a single cycle. Hence, \u03b1 is increased with an increment of 5\u25e6. With \u03b8 =40\u25e6 and \u03b1 =60\u25e6, the robot is able to climb on a 10\u25e6 ramp for four cycles (SI movie- 2:48 to 3:01). However, with \u03b8 =0\u25e6 and \u03b1 =60\u25e6, the robot is able to complete only one cycle and falls in the second cycle. With -60\u25e6 posture, the robot is not able to complete even one cycle and falls irrespective of the \u03b1 value.\nIn this section, it is important to highlight that when the robot undergoes a posture change, it becomes notably less stable, a phenomenon that becomes especially pronounced when navigating inclines as opposed to flat terrain. Therefore, the experiments conducted above demonstrate that, during incline traversal, enhancing the amplitude of the body angle across all body postures can significantly improve the robot\u2019s stability. The performance of the robot in terms of its ability to complete full four cycles during uphill movement for different postures and body angles is shown in Fig.12 A and B. In Fig.12, \u201dsuccess\u201c denotes the robot\u2019s ability to complete all four cycles, while \u201dFail\u201c indicates a scenario in which the robot\u2019s legs do not interfere with other body parts, however, it is unable to successfully complete all four cycles. \u201dUnattain-\nable\u201c refers to the configuration of the robot where the robot legs start interfering with other legs or the robot body and the motion gets locked. It may be noted that with \u03b8 =40\u25e6, the robot can have a maximum \u03b1 of 70\u25e6. Similarly, the maximum \u03b1 for \u03b8 =0\u25e6 and \u03b8 =-60\u25e6 is 60\u25e6 and 75\u25e6, respectively. If \u03b1 gets bigger than its maximum value, the robot reaches an unattainable or singular configuration. These experiments also show that during uphill movement, the stability of the robot also depends on the height of the robot body from the ground, h 2. The lower the value of h, the greater the stability of the robot.\n2) Downhill: The robot walks on a 5\u25e6 ramp for three cycles. For 40\u25e6 and 0\u25e6 postures, the robot completes 3 cycles without falling for all the body angles, as shown in Fig. 12. The locomotion of the robot with 40\u25e6 posture and 40\u25e6 body angle can be found in SI movie- 3:01 to 3:16). As the robot moves down the ramp, it has a tendency to fall towards the front irrespective of the posture and the body angle. This phenomenon gets more pronounced as the robot body\u2019s height increases from the ramp surface. Thus, for -60\u25e6 posture, the robot falls on its front by tipping over rather than falling on the back side which is observed when the robot climbs up the ramp (SI movie- 3:55 to 4:01). With -60\u25e6 posture, the robot fails to complete one cycle and falls irrespective of the body angle. However, with -40\u25e6 posture, the robot climbs down the ramp for all the body angles. The locomotion of the robot with 0\u25e6 posture and 45\u25e6 body angle can be found in SI movie- 4:02 to 4:11.\nNext, the robot walks on a 10\u25e6 ramp for three cycles. Like in the previous case, the robot completes 3 cycles without falling for all the body angles for 40\u25e6 and 0\u25e6 postures. For -60\u25e6 posture, the robot falls on its front by tipping over and is unable to complete one cycle. However, the robot is able to complete three cycles with -20\u25e6 postures for all the body angles. The locomotion of the robot with 40\u25e6 posture and 40\u25e6 body angle can be found in SI movie- 3:17 to 3:27."

Conversely, when the posture change is not applied, the robot becomes immobilized and remains stuck on the obstacle (SI movie- 5:01 to 5:12). Here, the robot changes its posture from +40\u25e6 to -20\u25e6. In Figure 13 B, the robot demonstrates its ability to navigate through a building entrance by adopting a posture change from -60\u25e6 to +40\u25e6 (SI movie- 4:13 to 4:36). Without the posture change, the robot experiences a collision with the gate, resulting in a subsequent fall (SI movie- 4:37 to 4:42). These two experiments validate the importance of posture change in quadruped robots to adapt themselves to real-world environments.

            "text": "The paper describes a quadruped robot called Adjustbot, which takes inspiration from crocodiles to achieve variable posture and adaptability to unstructured environments. The robot\u2019s posture change is accomplished through two parallelogram mechanisms, actuated simultaneously by a single servo through a gear drive. A bio-inspired approach is utilized to analyze the stability and gait selection of the robot.\nAfter the design, prototyping, stability analysis, and gait selection, the robot\u2019s posture-changing ability is tested in indoor and outdoor environments. The primary goals of the experiments are to avoid collisions, navigate through narrow channels, and overcome obstacles, and inclines. The robot achieves this by employing dynamic posture changes and lateral undulation, which enables it to adapt to challenging terrains. One notable aspect of the work is that it aims to demonstrate the robot\u2019s robustness and adaptability without relying on learning algorithms or posture-maintaining sensors like Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). Overall, the experiments emphasize the importance of the robot\u2019s ability to change its morphology (shape and posture) to overcome hurdles in dynamically challenging environments, making it more adaptable and stable without the need for complex learning or sensing mechanisms. Through ramp experiments, it is also found that the body angle\u2019s amplitude directly affects the robot\u2019s stability. The stability of the robot increases proportionally with higher amplitudes.\nIn our previous study, we investigated the impact of a variable stiffness robotic tail on the performance of a sprawling quadruped robot, emphasizing improved stability, maneuverability, and climbing ability [51]. The addition of a bioinspired, flexible tail to Adjustbot will be the focus of future studies in order to improve the robot\u2019s stability when it navigates slopes and other irregular terrain. On top of that, additional research will be done on the created robot for other field applications, such as burrowing and swarm applications."
