1. **Investigate the effects of different membrane materials and configurations on the performance of the integrated membrane system.** This could help to optimize the process and improve the efficiency of juice concentration and preservation.
2. **Explore the use of other membrane-based technologies, such as forward osmosis or electrodialysis, for the concentration of fruit juices.** These technologies may offer advantages over osmotic distillation, such as lower energy consumption or higher flux rates.
3. **Evaluate the stability and shelf life of the concentrated fruit juices produced by the integrated membrane system.** This is important to ensure that the juices retain their nutritional and organoleptic properties over time.
4. **Investigate the potential applications of the concentrated fruit juices in the food and beverage industry.** This could include the development of new products, such as functional beverages or fruit-flavored syrups.
5. **Explore the use of the integrated membrane system for the concentration of other types of fruit juices or plant extracts.** This could help to expand the range of products that can be produced using this technology.
