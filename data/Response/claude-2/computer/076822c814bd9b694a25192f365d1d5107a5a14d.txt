 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate other generative models like GANs or VAEs as the denoising module instead of the DPM. This could provide complementary benefits compared to the DPM.

2. Explore different network architectures for the enhancer and extractor modules. For example, using Transformers or CNNs with different depths could improve performance. 

3. Evaluate Diff-SV on a larger variety of noise types and acoustic conditions to further analyze its robustness and limitations. Testing on real-world noisy datasets would be especially valuable.

4. Apply Diff-SV to other speech processing tasks beyond speaker verification like speech recognition or speech separation to assess its generalization capabilities.

5. Extend Diff-SV to handle reverberation and channel effects in addition to additive noise. This could expand its applicability to distant talking and far-field conditions.
