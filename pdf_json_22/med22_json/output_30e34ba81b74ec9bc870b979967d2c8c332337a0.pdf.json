BinaxNOW detected 95.2% (95% CI, 91% to 98%) of persons who tested positive on RT-PCR with a Ct value below 30, 82.1% (CI, 77% to 87%) of those who tested positive on RT-PCR with a Ct value below 35, and 65.2% (CI, 60% to\n71%) of all who were positive on RT-PCR. Among 75 persons with simultaneous nasal and cheek swabs, BinaxNOW using a cheek swab failed to detect 91% (20 of 22) of specimens that were positive on BinaxNOW with a nasal swab. Among persons with simultaneous nasal and throat swabs who were positive on RT-PCR with a Ct value below 30, 42 of 49 (85.7%) were detected by nasal BinaxNOW, 23 of 49 (46.9%) by throat BinaxNOW, and 44 of 49 (89.8%) by either.\nLimitation: Participants were a cross-sectional sample from a community-based sentinel surveillance site, precluding study of viral or symptom dynamics.\nConclusion: BinaxNOW detected persons with high SARSCoV-2 levels during the Omicron surge, enabling rapid responses to positive test results. Cheek or throat swabs should not replace nasal swabs. As currently recommended, high-risk persons with an initial negative BinaxNOW result should have repeated testing.\nPrimary Funding Source: University of California, San Francisco.\nAnn Intern Med. doi:10.7326/M22-0202 Annals.org For author, article, and disclosure information, see end of text. This article was published at Annals.org on 15 March 2022. * Drs. DeRisi and Havlir contributed equally to this work.\nSARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests are a valuable publichealth tool in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They enable immediate identification of active SARS-CoV-2 infection with high viral levels, which can lead to faster isolation and curtail transmission chains (1\u20133). Antigen tests also enable the rapid diagnosis needed for initiation of time-sensitive outpatient COVID-19 therapies (4, 5). Many community testing programs, including school programs, use rapid tests; home antigen testing is increasingly becoming available in the United States and is widely available in some countries. Widespread use of rapid antigen tests is based on performance evaluations in the context of the ancestral, Alpha, or Delta variants (6, 7).\nIt is vital to evaluate performance of rapid antigen tests when new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advised caution on rapid test use for detection of the Omicron variant in December 2021 (8). TheOmicron variant hasmore than 50mutations compared with ancestral lineages; the majority are in the spike protein, but 4 are in the nucleocapsid gene\u2014the\ntarget gene in the BinaxNOW assay (Abbott). Although laboratory studies suggest that the performance of BinaxNOW should not be affected when used to detect the Omicron variant, field validation is needed (7). We sought to examine performance of the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test at our community-based site in the Mission District of San Francisco, California, a setting in which we have evaluated its performance with previous variants and routinely used it for walk-up low-barrier testing (9, 10)."

The site is led by Unidos en Salud, an academic (University of California, San Francisco [UCSF] and Chan Zuckerberg Biohub), community (San Francisco Latino Task Force for COVID-19), and public health (San Francisco Department of Public Health) collaboration that conducts SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and serves communities with the highest risk for COVID-19 (9\u2013 11). Unidos en Salud serves a San Francisco community with a large proportion of frontline workers, immigrants, andmonolingual families living inmultigenerational households, themajority of whom are Latinx.\nPersons seeking testing provided demographic characteristics, symptoms and onset date, vaccination status, reason for testing, and informed consent. There was no age restriction. On all days, certified laboratory assistants collected bilateral anterior nasal swabs according to manufacturer instructions (12). A second anterior nasal swab was immediately collected for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Certified readers read BinaxNOW cards, and results were returned within an hour of testing using secure messaging in the Primary.Health platform. Three invalid results (out of 921 [0.3%]) were excluded from these analyses. Photographed cards were reread by a blinded trained expert, and these results were considered final for analyses. On 9 January 2022, we also collected simultaneous oral cheek swabs on 75 persons randomly selected from among those seeking testing that day and tested these for SARS-CoV-2 with BinaxNOW and RT-PCR. On 14 January 2022, we also collected simultaneous oral throat (tonsillar) swabs on 115 persons randomly selected from among those seeking testing that day and tested for SARS-CoV-2 with BinaxNOW and RT-PCR.\nBilingual (Spanish and English) staff from Unidos en Salud called persons diagnosed with COVID-19 to offer supportive services, including home deliveries of supplies, food, and care items, as previously described (11). Persons who were eligible for COVID-19 treatment were referred to their primary health provider or Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.\nAs previously described (13), RT-PCR using probes specific to N and E genes was performed on the nasal and oral swabs collected in DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research) with an internal human positive control (RNase P). The assay limit of detection is 100 viral copies per milliliter; cycle threshold (Ct) values below 40 were considered positive. Cycle threshold is a surrogate measure of the amount of virus in a clinical specimen; lower values are associated with higher rates of positive viral culture results (14\u201316). Variant lineage was determined by full genome sequencing using the ARTIC Network V3 primers and the Illumina NovaSeq platform, followed by consensus genome assembly using the COVID module of the freely available CZ ID (formerly IDseq) pipeline, as described previously (17, 18). Complete genomes were deposited in GISAID (Accession EPI_ISL_882925, with virus name \u201chCoV-19/USA/CA-UCSF-JDxxxx/2022\u201d).\nAmong persons with a positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2, both overall and among those with RT-PCR Ct values below 30 and below 35, we calculated the\nproportion testing positive on BinaxNOW.We also calculated the proportion of persons with a negative RT-PCR result who tested negative on BinaxNOW and the proportions with positive RT-PCR results and Ct values of 30 or higher and 35 or higher, respectively; 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Clopper\u2013Pearson method.We examined assay performance in strata defined by presence versus absence of symptoms at the time of testing, age, and vaccination status. Mean Ct values among symptomatic and asymptomatic persons and vaccinated and unvaccinated persons were compared using difference in means, with confidence intervals calculated using the t distribution. We performed analogous analyses among persons with simultaneous nares and cheek swabs and simultaneous nares and throat swabs."

This cross-sectional analysis confirms that the ability of the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test to detect infection with the Omicron variant, particularly at higher virus levels, is similar to its ability to detect prior variants (9, 10, 19). The BinaxNOW assay rapidly identifies persons with the highest virus levels, who are likely to pose the greatest risk for transmission at the time of the test (14). A positive rapid test result thus enables immediate public health and personal action for isolation, disease mitigation, and clinical care, in a disease process where chains of transmission need to be broken and therapies are time-sensitive. With the increasing availability of this test in the United States, this information can inform optimal\nCt = cycle threshold; RT-PCR = reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. * A lower Ct value is a surrogate measure for higher levels of virus from clinical specimens."

Persons who have low levels of virus detectable on RT-PCR but not antigen testing may be at either the upswing or the downswing of the viral dynamic curve for SARS-CoV-2\n(20). In the setting of an acute surge, many persons are likely to have been recently infected, and thus those initially testing negative using BinaxNOW may subsequently develop higher viral loads associated with greater infectiousness and may become detectable on repeated testing 1 to 2 days later. Persons at high risk for COVID-19 with a single negative test result should thus wear masks and undergo repeated rapid or RT-PCR\nThe figure shows RT-PCR Ct values and BinaxNOW rapid antigen test results among symptomatic and asymptomatic participants (A) and stratified by days since symptom onset among symptomatic participants (B) and by vaccination status (completed primary mRNA vaccine series plus booster, completed primary mRNA vaccine series without booster, incomplete mRNA primary vaccine series, no vaccine, and unknown vaccination status or selfreported receipt of non-mRNA vaccine) (C).

Cycle threshold values were higher among asymptomatic versus symptomatic persons but were similar by vaccine status, the latter of which is consistent with prior observations in preOmicron variants (22\u201324).\nOmicron putatively has a shorter incubation period than prior variants. Symptoms may be intense in the upper respiratory tract, and the virus appears to be less pathogenic in the lower airway compared with prior variants (25). One small study with 5 positive health care workers suggested detection is faster from oral versus nasal swabs (26). Although we only examined 75 paired nasal and oral cheek swabs in a cross-sectional analysis, our data suggest that a simple oral cheek swab does not increase detection of SARS-CoV-2. Even with the prominent clinical feature of pharyngitis in persons with the Omicron variant, our data from 115 paired nasal and throat swabs also argue against replacing nasal swabs with throat swabs for diagnosis. At the time of presentation to a community-based testing site, we saw only a small (<5%) increase in detection of COVID-19 with addition of a throat swab to a nasal swab. Although these findings do not directly contradict the potential for earlier positivity via throat swab, they do suggest that in a high-throughput community testing site, the complexity and cost of such an approach would need to be formally evaluated before adoption.\nThe ongoing presence of a walk-up COVID-19 community testing and surveillance site permitted the rapid collection and analyses of these data. The Unidos en\nSalud collaboration, established in April 2020 near the start of the pandemic, provides a model of how a community, academic, and public health partnership can provide testing and vaccine services to a disproportionately affected community while also generating data to inform both community members and the wider scientific discourse (1, 9\u201311, 27\u201330). More than half the clients seeking services at this site self-reported not having insurance coverage or not being able to identify a primary provider where they might otherwise access health services (1). Easy access to rapid testing at a site located in the heart of the community, with friendly community staffing and accessible hours (including weekends), serves a vital role in supporting the frontline workers disproportionately exposed to infection, who are often working multiple jobs to support the ongoing functioning of the economy.\nLimitations of our study included the use of self-reported vaccine status, which may have led to misclassification, and the use of a cross-sectional sample. Persons who were asymptomatic at the time of testing may have subsequently developed symptoms, and our analyses did not assess the evolution of Ct values or RT-PCR and BinaxNOW test positivity (overall or by sample site) over time. Trained technicians collected the samples and read the BinaxNOW cards. Although results could vary when these actions are performed by nontechnicians, such as in the home setting, the overall finding of similar detection of the Omicron variant compared with prior variants by this rapid antigen test remains applicable. Theperformanceof BinaxNOWobserved in this study was in the setting of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, resulting in a high positive predictive value. In settings with low disease prevalence, RT-PCR should be performed to confirm a positive BinaxNOW result, particularly in persons without symptomsor exposures (9).\nCt = cycle threshold; RT-PCR = reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. * A lower Ct value is a surrogate measure for higher levels of virus from clinical specimens.
