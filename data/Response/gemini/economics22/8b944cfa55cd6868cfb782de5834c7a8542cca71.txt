1. **Investigate the role of peer influence and social networks in solar PV adoption.** The study found that peer influence is a significant factor in solar PV adoption, but more research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms through which this influence occurs. For example, future studies could examine how the strength of social ties, the similarity of social network members, and the geographic proximity of social network members affect solar PV adoption.


2. **Explore the impact of housing construction on solar PV adoption.** The study found that housing construction is a key driver of solar PV adoption, but more research is needed to understand the specific factors that contribute to this relationship. For example, future studies could examine how the type of housing construction (e.g., single-family homes vs. multi-family homes), the location of housing construction (e.g., urban vs. rural areas), and the availability of financial incentives for solar PV installation affect the likelihood of solar PV adoption in newly constructed homes.


3. **Develop more accurate data on solar PV adoption.** The study found that the accuracy of the model's predictions could be improved by collecting more data on solar PV adoption. For example, future studies could collect data on the socio-economic characteristics of solar PV adopters, the types of solar PV systems that are installed, and the reasons why people choose to install solar PV systems. This data could be used to improve the accuracy of the model's predictions and to identify new factors that influence solar PV adoption.


4. **Investigate the impact of policy and regulatory changes on solar PV adoption.** The study found that policy and regulatory changes can have a significant impact on solar PV adoption. For example, the introduction of financial incentives for solar PV installation can lead to a significant increase in adoption rates. Future studies could examine the impact of different policy and regulatory changes on solar PV adoption, and identify the most effective policies and regulations for promoting solar PV adoption.


5. **Develop a more comprehensive model of the solar PV market.** The study developed a hybrid model that combines statistical methods and agent-based modeling to predict solar PV adoption. However, the model is still relatively simple and does not account for all of the factors that influence solar PV adoption. Future studies could develop more comprehensive models that incorporate additional factors, such as the impact of climate change, the availability of grid-connected storage, and the role of energy efficiency programs.
