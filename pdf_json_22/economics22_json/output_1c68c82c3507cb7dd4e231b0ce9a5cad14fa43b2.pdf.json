            "heading": "1 Introduction",
            "text": "Banks are key providers of funds to the corporate sector and played a prominent role during the COVID-19 pandemic. To maintain their role as credit providers, the financial soundness and solvency of the banking sector are of vital importance. Preserving the financial stability of the banking system is a primary objective of banking supervision, which however needs to strike the appropriate balance between two different, albeit highly interrelated, dimensions of prudential policy. At the micro level, prudential supervision aims at safeguarding individual financial institutions from idiosyncratic risks by preventing them from building-up vulnerabilities resulting from excessive risk-taking. At the macro level, prudential supervision aims to detect threats to financial stability stemming from the interactions among individual financial institutions, while also accounting for the feedback loops between the financial sector and the real economy, to prevent or mitigate risks to the entire financial system arising from macroeconomic conditions (Osinski et al., 2013; Boissay and Cappiello, 2014).1\nAlthough the micro- and macro approaches are complementary, their different focus 1The Global Financial Crisis in 2007 showed that the stability of individual financial institutions alone is not enough to ensure the stability of the financial system as a whole. Thus, the Basel III accords have significantly changed prudential supervision, with a view to complementing micro-prudential supervision with a macro-prudential dimension.\n2\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\ncan results in tensions - especially during downturns - and supervisor authorities are aware of this: \u201cDuring downturns [...], diverging micro- and macro-prudential approaches could generate frictions. This, in turn, could lead to inefficient outcomes, especially as microprudential policies may inadvertently cause negative externalities on the financial system as a whole.\u201d(Boissay and Cappiello (2014), page 139). This is because during downturns, micro-prudential authorities are concerned with ensuring the stability of the individual financial institutions, whereas macro-prudential policies focus on stabilizing the system as a whole and ensuring that the crisis does not result in a credit crunch as a consequence of banks\u2019 deleveraging (Osinski et al., 2013).\nThe objectives of preserving the intermediation capacity of the banks - ensuring fi-\nnancing to the corporate sector \u2013 while safeguarding the solvency of banks may require policies that are not always aligned and that can conflict with each other causing negative externalities. For example, the current micro-regulatory framework requires banks to increase risk-weights of credit exposures to recognise lower borrowers\u2019 credit standing. This, in turn, raises capital requirements. Since equity is a limited resource and cannot be quickly raised by banks, especially during crisis periods, banks may be forced to reduce lending, especially towards riskier borrowers, to comply with capital regulation (e.g., by not extending expiring loans and/or selling corporate securities in their portfolios). In other words, micro-prudential policies aimed at increasing the resilience of individual banks may have systemic consequences, especially during downturns (Osinski et al., 2013; Boissay and Cappiello, 2014).\nA key role in this framework is played by model-based regulation, which represents\none of the most important changes in banking regulation occurred in the last decades. In contrast with the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach of Basel I, the Basel II and successive amendments allowed banks to use either the Standardised Approach (SA) or the Internal\n3\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nRatings-Based (IRB) approach to calculate their minimum capital requirements.2 The rationale behind model-based regulation was to increase the risk sensitivity of banks\u2019 capital by aligning more accurately capital requirements with the underlying risks to which a bank is exposed (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2001). Thus, if IRB models work as intended, they would induce banks to incorporate growing borrowers\u2019 risk in a timely manner and respond more dynamically to changes in risk compared to banks using standardized approaches. Accordingly, this translates into higher capital absorbed by these exposures and could induce IRB banks to curtail their lending provision to maintain capital adequacy. In such a case, tensions between micro and macro prudential approaches increase since tighter requirements will translate into a reduced capacity for banks to extend credit to borrowers, potentially exacerbating the economic downturn. At the same time, IRB models have complex features and cannot be treated as a homogeneous group, as they typically vary across banks in both the risk parameters included in the model and their calibration.3 In particular, the inclusion of parameters specifically designed to account for economic downturns should improve banks\u2019 resilience and ultimately support banks using IRB models to continue lending also during bad times. In such a case, tensions between micro and macro prudential approaches will be mitigated.\nThis discussion leads us to formulate the following two questions. Does model-based\nregulation unambiguously increase risk sensitiveness of capital requirements? Are there features of IRB models that can limit the negative impact on credit provision when a large shock occurs? The answer to the first question relates to the ability of IRB approaches to support the stability and soundness of banks and therefore achieving the objectives of\n2The SA approach entails a simpler methodology, whereby fixed risk-weights (i.e., pre-determined by the supervisory authorities) are assigned to different categories of borrowers (e.g., banks, corporate, retail, etc) so that risk-weights are the same for all banks. Instead, the IRB approach relies on banks\u2019 own (internal) models so that each bank calculates its own risk-weights. Specifically, banks are allowed to use their own models, which have been ex-ante scrutinized and authorized by the supervisory authority, to estimate the credit risk parameters (such as probability of default and loss given default) that feed the regulatory formulas used to calculate risk weights and thus the minimum level of regulatory capital.\n3The European Central Bank launched in 2016 a Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) project aiming to harmonise supervisory practices relating to internal models within the Single Supervisory Mechanism area.\n4\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nmicro-prudential supervision. At the same time, we may want to assess whether some characteristics of the IRB models can mitigate the negative effects on credit supply during a downturn and therefore support the stability of the banking sector also from a macroprudential point of view.\nIn this paper, we address these questions by exploiting the occurrence of the COVID-\n19 pandemic and relying on a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) identification strategy to study the reaction of a sample of euro area banks using IRB and SA approaches. The pandemic provides a quasi-natural experiment setting since i) COVID-19 is an exogenous shock and orthogonal to bank behaviour; and ii) it is reasonable to expect that the COVID-19 shock had a different impact (in terms of capital charges) on IRB and SA banks because of the different risk sensitivity of the two approaches. Although COVID-19 did not directly affect banks (neither IRB nor SA banks), it had an impact on banks\u2019 borrowers (especially non-financial corporations) and their risk profile. Following a change in borrowers\u2019 risk, we expect banks using internal models to react quicker than SA banks in making adjustments. The swifter reaction of IRB banks will be reflected in higher capital requirements, potentially inducing these banks to deleverage by reducing their credit exposures, especially towards riskier borrowers such as Non-Financial Corporations (NFCs). The effect for banks using a SA approach should be more muted since they use fixed risk-weights that are less sensitive to a sudden increase in risks.\nIn our first set of analyses, we compare the lending behaviour of IRB and large SA\nbanks using a bank-level proprietary dataset on euro area banks. In the second step, we complement our analysis by using proprietary loan-level data on banks\u2019 \u201clarge exposures\u201d, including virtually all bank-firm relationships in the euro area either greater than e300 million or weighting more than 10% of banks\u2019 regulatory capital. For this analysis, we rely on a sample constituted by multiple lending relationships of a borrower to banks using different regulatory arrangements, therefore controlling for demand shocks. Our results\n5\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nshow that IRB banks reduced on-balance sheet credit exposures to NFCs, especially loans, relative to SA banks in the aftermath of March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic started. By exploiting the multiple lending relationships found in the large exposures data, we document that the decrease in loans was due to a reduction in credit supply - and not due to lower demand. Notably, exposures through off-balance sheet items, which are treated differently in the evaluation of risk-weighted assets, in particular loan commitments, did not follow the same pattern.\nIn the next steps of our analysis, we develop an alternative identification strategy\nfocusing only on the sample of banks using IRB models, and we compare the lending behaviour of IRB banks with different levels of capital buffers above the minimum regulatory requirements. We show that capital-constrained IRB banks are forced to reduce lending in a pandemic scenario, whereas highly capitalised IRB banks have the option to use their capital buffers against the increase in the risk of their assets. Notably, when replicating this analysis on the sample of banks using the SA approach, we do not find consistent results, suggesting that this particular capital regulatory channel holds exclusively for IRB banks.\nFinally, we provide evidence that the higher model-based risk sensitiveness of IRB\nmodels does not always result in lower credit provision when a large shock occurs. Specifically, our final analysis presents causal evidence that certain features of model-based regulation, like the downturn Loss Given Default (LGD) parameter, are important to ensure that capital is built-up appropriately ex-ante to increase resilience and moderate the negative effects on lending provision.\nOur sample of large exposures provides us with several unique features that support\nthe robustness of our results. First, the international dimension of banks and borrowers enables us to have findings that do not depend on a single country\u2019s experience. Furthermore, there is evidence that relationship lending - the number and duration of bank-firm\n6\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nrelationships - affects bank credit provision to firms during a downturn (see for example, Sette and Gobbi, 2015). Moreover, \u201clarge exposures\u201d were not supported during COVID19 with Government Guarantees that could bias our analyses, as it would have been the case for loans to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Lastly, large exposures absorb a large amount of banks\u2019 equity. Thus, it is rational to expect that, after the COVID-19 eruption, banks would concentrate their efforts to reduce risk by decreasing the largest exposures.\nOur paper contributes significantly to two distinct strands of literature analysing how\nregulatory requirements and financial crises affect bank lending. First, there is vast and growing literature analysing the relationship between bank regulation and bank credit supply. Most of this literature uses as an identification device the shock caused by tighter regulation, usually an increase in the minimum capital requirements, which would translate in lower lending. The setting of higher capital requirements by regulators is followed by a reduction in corporate and household lending (Bridges et al., 2014; Aiyar et al., 2014a; De Marco et al., 2021; Fraisse et al., 2020; De Jonghe et al., 2020a) and crossborder lending in the UK (Aiyar et al., 2014b). Banks participating in the European Banking Authority (EBA) capital exercise in 2011 reacted to higher capital requirements by reducing lending, rather than issuing new equity (Me\u0301sonnier and Monks, 2015; Gropp et al., 2019). Similarly, stress-tests exercises resulting in higher capital requirements are also affecting banks\u2019 willingness to supply credit (Acharya et al., 2018; Corte\u0301s et al., 2020). By contrast, the introduction of counter-cyclical capital buffers in Spain smoothed the credit supply cycles, sustaining lending to firms and employment in crisis periods (Jime\u0301nez et al., 2017).\nIn the context of this literature, only a limited number of papers have directly inves-\ntigated the role played by model-based regulation (Behn et al., 2016; Bruno et al., 2017; Behn et al., 2022) and are therefore closer in spirit to our analysis. Exploiting the episode\n7\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nof the failure of Lehman Brothers, Behn et al. (2016) show the pro-cyclical effect induced by model-based regulation on firm borrowing. Bruno et al. (2017) find that banks using IRB approaches more extensively respond to shocks by reshuffling their assets towards less capital intensive activities, thus the capital channel is stronger for IRB banks. Focusing on German banks, Behn et al. (2022) show that model-based risk estimates systematically under-predict actual default rates, and that both default and loss rates are higher for loans that were originated under the model-based approach. This paper suggests that IRB banks may be somewhat under capitalized and therefore when facing a large exogenous shock they would swiftly readjust to take into account the increased risk.\nOur paper offers two main contributions to this literature. First and foremost, we\nidentify the features of IRB models affecting lending and we provide readers with novel evidence that model-based sensitiveness to risk does not always result in lower credit provision when a shock occurs. We show that the effect of IRB regulation depends on the level of capitalisation when the shock hits as our findings indicate that poorly capitalised IRB banks decreased more their lending relative to more capitalized IRB banks. In particular, IRB banks close to the minimum regulatory requirements reduced their exposures more towards borrowers absorbing relatively more regulatory capital - borrowers for which credit risk mitigation was limited - and for borrowers belonging to the industrial sectors most affected by the pandemic. Additionally, when restricting the sample to IRB and SA banks with low capital buffers, we find evidence of a stronger economic significance of our results. Notably, we do not find a similar result when we restrict the analysis only to SA banks.\nNext, we open the black-box of IRB models and we investigate the features driving this\nwedge in credit provision as a reaction to a large shock. By using confidential information concerning the revision of internal models carried out by the European supervisors over the last few years, we report that the use of advanced IRB approaches, and in particular\n8\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nthe downturn LGD adjustment, permits banks to decrease their corporate exposures less (or increase their exposures more) compared to banks not using the downturn LGD parameter. This finding suggests that these complex IRB models are indeed better equipped to update the risk assessment in the event of a shock, in turn directly affecting credit exposures. IRB models that can be calibrated to evaluate the effects of high risk scenarios and the consequent losses render banks generally more resilient to shocks and able to continue lending even after a major negative event. Related to this aspect, and somewhat contrary to the evidence in Behn et al. (2016), we fail to provide support to the notion that IRB banks are underestimating credit risk. Indeed, exposures decrease more for those firms/sectors more affected by the pandemic, while we also exclude the possibility that credit was extended zombie firms.\nThe second important contribution to this literature stems from the multi-country\ndimension of our sample, which ensures that our results do not depend on a single country experience. Indeed, the banks in our sample are all directly supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) following a harmonised approach, and thus our findings are not driven by specific features of national supervision in charge of the validation of IRB models.4 Additionally, the recent analysis in Kosekova et al. (2022), based on loan-level data for the euro area, shows that bank-firm relationships differ significantly across countries, therefore insights based on single country analysis should be evaluated with care. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions specific to a single country should play a much lower role in combination with the impact of model-based regulation in our analysis. After the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, Behn et al. (2016) argue that IRB models induced a procyclical effect on corporate borrowing. Leveraging on the cross-country dimension of our dataset, we explore whether model-based regulation may have interacted and compounded with country-specific credit cycles. In this respect, we show that, although credit cycles in\n4IRB models were generally validated by national supervisory authorities before the Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) carried out by the ECB.\n9\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nEuro area countries were different before the pandemic, the reduction in credit exposures induced by model-based regulation does not depend on these differences and it is not driven by banks experiencing a credit boom before 2020Q1.\nOur paper also contributes to a large academic literature studying lending during\nfinancial crises. Puri et al. (2011) reports that German savings banks affected by the US subprime mortgage crisis substantially rejected loan applications more than the nonaffected banks after August 2007. Various studies show that when a large international shock occurs, banks tend to retrench and increase their relative exposure to domestic or geographically closer borrowers. For example, following the Lehman Brothers collapse, US banks almost halved their lending to large corporates (Ivashina and Scharfstein, 2010), while they decreased less the lending to borrowers geographically close (De Haas and Van Horen, 2013). Ongena et al. (2015) find that banks borrowing internationally decreased credit supply more towards small and medium-sized firms in Eastern Europe and Turkey than towards locally funded domestic banks during the financial crisis. Likewise, Popov and Van Horen (2015) show that the sovereign stress exported by GIIPS countries between 2009 and 2011 had a sizeable negative impact on bank lending of non-GIIPS countries.5 Somewhat differently from this literature, we do not find evidence of a retrenchment of foreign exposures vis-a\u0300-vis domestic exposures. Borrowers in our sample are large multinational companies of relatively good quality, and this may explain our results. At the same time, we show that even these large corporates are not able to fully insulate from the effect of IRB models on lending - for example using other forms of financing. We show that large corporates more dependent on the credit provided by IRB banks experience a larger drop in investments relative to other firms. The decrease is statistically significant for short-term financial investment (trade receivables), tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed-assets. Additionally, we document that investments in receivables and tangible fixed\n5GIIPS countries refer to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.\n10\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nassets were financed in 2020 by the usage of capital reserves instead of the issuance of new capital, therefore suggesting the presence of financing constraints.\nA number of studies have recently analysed the impact on bank lending of the COVID-\n19 crisis. Hasan et al. (2021) show a rise in the pricing of syndicated loans as a result of an increase in borrowers and lenders\u2019 exposures to the pandemic while Dursun-de Neef and Schandlbauer (2020) document a higher loan supply by banks highly exposed to the COVID-19. We contribute to this literature by emphasising an important additional channel of transmission of shocks through banks\u2019 regulation. We show that (low capitalized) IRB banks reduced their exposures more towards industries more affected by the pandemic and for which risk would have gone up the most. This suggests that model-based regulation has an impact on the allocation of funds to the corporate sector when a large shock occurs and that this effect works through the level of capital of the banks. We also provide complementary evidence to the analysis in Kapan and Minoiu (2021), who show that US banks with larger ex-ante credit line portfolios, thus higher risk of drawdowns, tightened more loan supply and the terms on new loans when the COVID-19 crisis occurred. In our sample, IRB banks decreased their on-balance sheet exposures, but not their loan commitments (off-balance sheet exposures). Different implications in terms of capital requirements of on- and off-balance sheet exposures seems particularly relevant for banks using internal model-based regulation.6\nOur results have important policy implications. During this pandemic crisis, banks\nplayed a key role in smoothing the negative effects on the economy by providing funding to corporates and households, also thanks to the extensive support provided by the policy package approved in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The EU banking package and the supervisory reliefs aimed at avoiding a credit retrenchment did not specifically address model-based regulation. Our analysis suggests that IRB models worked as in-\n6We do not find similar results for the sample of SA banks.\n11\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\ntended, increasing the risk sensitivity of capital requirements and supporting the stability of banks at the occurrence of a large shock, thus achieving the micro-prudential objectives. At the same time, certain features of model-based regulation, like a downturn LGD, are critical to ensure that capital is built-up appropriately ex-ante to increase resilience and moderate the negative effects on lending provision, ultimately supporting macroeconomic stability.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the bank- and loan-\nlevel variables employed in this paper as well as the identification strategy used to assess the lending behaviour of SA and IRB banks. Section 3 discusses the main results from our analyses, while Section 4 focuses on alternative identification strategies. In Section 5, the paper provides a set of robustness analyses while Section 6 focuses on assessing the economic impact on corporates. Section 7 concludes."

            "heading": "2.1 Data Description",
            "text": "To investigate the lending behaviour of IRB and SA banks during the COVID-19 shock, this paper leverages two datasets with two distinct levels of aggregation: bank and loanlevel data. Bank-level data are obtained from the confidential FINREP (\u201dFINancial REPorting\u201d) and COREP (\u201cCOmmon REPorting\u201d) supervisory data from the European Central Bank. The FINREP framework is intended for financial accounting reporting while COREP is the framework for the capital and funding adequacy regime envisaged by Basel III regulation. As such, these data contain detailed information on the consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements and capital adequacy of virtually all euro area credit institutions on a quarterly basis.\nWe compile the final bank-level dataset in the following way. First, we exclude from\n12\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nour analysis subsidiaries and foreign-owned banks.7 Secondly, we keep the consolidated statements of banks, unless banks exclusively report at unconsolidated level.8 Finally, we remove from our sample those banks that lack data on total assets, equity and net income or with total assets below e1 billion. This yields to a final bank-level sample of 250 banks (of which 70 banks using IRB models) classified either as ultimate parents or stand-alone banks across 17 countries. At the end of 2019, the banks in our sample had an overall asset size of 23.3 trillion (19.8 trillion for the 70 IRB banks), provided loans to the economy for 15.3 trillion (13 trillion from IRB banks) and loans to NFCs for 5.3 trillion (4.6 trillion from IRB banks). Table A1 in the Appendix shows the sample composition by reporting the number of banks used for our bank-level analyses by country and by the approach used to determine the minimum capital requirements. It is worth clarifying that, throughout the rest of the paper, banks are classified as IRB is they use their own internal models to calculate capital charges for their corporate credit exposures.\nFor our analyses at loan-level, we exploit the unique dataset constituted by the micro-\nprudential supervisory framework on \u201clarge exposures\u201d. In 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) set out the large exposures framework to complement riskbased capital requirements as the latter do not protect banks from large losses resulting from the sudden default of a single counterparty or group of connected counterparties. According to this supervisory framework, an institution\u2019s exposure is defined as \u201clarge\u201d when, before applying credit risk mitigations and exemptions, it is equal or higher than 10% of an institution\u2019s eligible capital vis-a\u0300-vis a single client or a group of connected clients.9,10,11 Credit institutions reporting FINREP supervisory data are also requested to\n7We keep in our sample six subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks as these banks are classified as Significant Supervised Entities by the ECB.\n8This is often the case for smaller credit institutions that are not part of any banking group. 9The large exposure limit is set at 25% of a bank\u2019s eligible capital or 15% for exposures among Globally Systemic Banks (G-SIBs). 10Eligible capital is defined as the sum of Tier 1 capital plus one-third or less of Tier 2 capital (CRR, Art.4(71)). 11The European Union implemented Basel III regulation via the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), and the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) of 26 June 2013. The Framework for Large Exposures can be found in Articles 387 to 403 of the CRR. In particular, the definition of Large\n13\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nreport large exposures information with a value above or equal to EUR 300 million.12\nThe use of loan-level data on large exposures provides three important advantages.\nFirst, while bank-level data enable us to estimate differential changes between IRB and SA banks, they do not allow us to disentangle changes due to credit supply effects from changes due to credit demand effects. We address this shortcoming using data at the loan-level and building an identification strategy based on multiple-lending relationships, which enables us to establish if the observed variations in credit exposures are due to a decision of IRB banks (credit supply shock). Second, these loans refer to large, strategically important borrowers and it can be expected that banks change first their exposure towards these borrowers after the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 in order to decrease their overall risk exposure. During stress periods, banks will either increase lending to support their important customers (large borrowers in a time of crisis) or decrease it to relieve the pressure on capital. Finally, large exposures data allow us to work with a global sample of borrowers, which is a major advantage compared to the use of national credit registries.\nThe construction of our database involved significant work in matching different sam-\nples and databases.13 We proceed in three steps. First, we exploit the (limited) available data on the counterparties and we merge the data using the LEI code of the borrower with Bureau van Dijk\u2019s Orbis data.

For this study, we use the template LE1 (C.27): identification of the counterparty, and LE2 (C.28): exposures to individual client and group of connected clients.\n13The COREP supervisory framework \u201cLarge Exposures\u201d requires banks to provide the following information on the counterparty: the unique borrower identifier, name, Legal Entity Identifier (LEI code), country, sector, and NACE classification of the borrower. However, the majority of exposures lack this qualitative information, with the unique identifier and name of the borrower being often the only information identifying the counterparty. Furthermore, as per regulation, the unique borrower identifier depends on the national reporting system. In practical terms, this implies that a borrower cannot be uniquely identified only relying on information in the \u201cLarge Exposure\u201d dataset when the lenders are from different countries.\n14\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nfinancial corporation (e.g., mutual funds and insurances) and (iii) households. Furthermore, a successful match with Orbis enriches the data with information on the country and sector of the counterparty.14 In the second step, we manually map the remaining counterparties lacking the LEI code across banks and across countries using the counterparty name as reported by the credit institutions and we fill the missing information using several sources such as gleif.org and SNL. Finally, we drop from our sample those borrowers for which we completely lack information on the sector, thus limiting the risk of including exposures other than NFCs.\nWhen analysing bank lending behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic, an impor-\ntant issue to consider is the financial support provided by the governments to firms to alleviate the negative impact of the pandemic. To this end, we report in Table A2 in the Appendix the importance of public guarantees on credit exposures in the Euro area and in the four largest jurisdictions according to their nominal amount.15 For each bucket and each country, we show the quota of loans that received governments\u2019 support (number of supported loans over total number of loans), and the quota of the volume of support granted (the amount guaranteed over the total amount of the loans). We show that public financial guarantees were widely used for loans in the smallest bucket (15.6% of credit exposures granted in the third quarter of 2020 received a public guarantee, so that the value of credit exposure publicly guaranteed was 27.5% of all loans), while they were relatively rare for the higher tranches of loans (0.6% of number of credit exposures, and 2.5% in terms of value). Given that our loan-level sample of large exposure includes only loans greater than e300 million (or loans greater than 10% of the Tier1 capital of the bank issuing the loan), we can conclude that the credit exposures analysed in our paper are not guaranteed and that governments\u2019 financial support did not influence our analyses.\n14We use the Nomenclature of Economic Activities (NACE) classification 15We select five buckets: up to e100 thousand; between e100 thousand and e10 million; between e10\nmillion and e100 million; between e100 million and e300 million; and greater than e300 million.\n15\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670"

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, a natural disaster hitting Europe since March 2020, provides us with an excellent setting to investigate whether model-based regulation provides banks with risk-sensitive risk weights and affects their lending provision. Specifically, we look at the lending behavior of banks to see whether banks using different approaches for capital regulation reacted differently to the COVID-19 shock.\nAlthough COVID-19 did not directly hit banks (neither IRB banks nor SA banks),\nthe economic channel linking the pandemic shock to banks is intuitive. The downturn caused by COVID-19 directly affected the solvency of NFCs, resulting in a heightened risk of firms failing to repay their debt obligations. From a bank perspective, the pandemic induced different effects on banks depending on the risk models used to determine capital charges. Therefore, the first step of our analysis entails comparing the reaction of IRB and SA banks. IRB banks using model-based risk-weights immediately registered, ceteris paribus, a deterioration of internal borrowers\u2019 rating, leading to an increase in their RiskWeighted Assets (RWA), and thus in capital absorbed by the exposures. Conversely, SA banks using fixed risk-weights that are not - or much less - risk-sensitive, did not register any increase in their RWA and capital absorbed.\nWe begin our analysis using supervisory data at the bank-level. Our identifica-\ntion strategy relies on a Difference-In-Differences (DiD) approach, enabling us to identify whether, after the outbreak of the COVID-19 in March 2020, IRB banks dropped their lending more relative to SA banks. Our baseline identification strategy is based on the following model:\n\u2206Log(Y )i,t = \u03b21IRBi \u00d7 Postt + \u03b22Xi,t\u22121 \u00d7 Postt + \u03b23Xi,t\u22121 + \u03b3i + \u03b3c\u00d7t + \u03f5i,t (1)\nwhere our dependent variable (\u2206Log(Y )i,t = Log(Yi,t) \u2212 Log(Yi,t\u22121)) is the quarter-on-\n16\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nquarter growth rate of the credit exposures of bank i. We use various measures of onand off-balance sheet credit exposures to gain a broad understanding of the impact of COVID-19. The analysis starts with a measure including all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures (total credit origination).16 In a second step, we disentangle this measure in total on-balance sheet and total off-balance sheet credit exposures. Finally, we focus on bank loans. For each of the variable employed in the model, we also distinguish the counterparties, thus differentiating between exposures towards NFCs and other than NFCs (Non-NFCs).17\nOur treatment period variable (Post) takes the value of one for the quarters 2020Q2-\n2020Q3, and zero for 2019Q2-2020Q1.18 The variable IRBi takes the value of one for banks using internal models for the calculation of capital requirements for their corporate credit risk exposures (treatment group), and zero for banks using the Standardised Approach (control group). The coefficient of main interest is \u03b21 for the interaction variable Post\u00d7 IRBi that, ceteris paribus, captures the COVID-19 pandemic effect on IRB banks\u2019 lending.\nEq.(1) includes a vector of bank characteristics (Xi,t\u22121) that could affect bank lend-\ning behaviour.

(1) omitting 2020Q1 (when the COVID-19 pandemic started in Europe), and we compare lending during 2019 with the second and third quarter of 2020. While it is difficult to pinpoint an exact day for the start of the pandemic crisis in Europe, several papers use the 21st of February 2020 as a reference date, when several municipalities in Northern Italy entered lockdown (Albuquerque et al., 2020; Ramelli and Wagner, 2020).\n19SREP stands for Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process and it refers to the annual assessment conducted by the ECB to evaluate banks\u2019 risk profiles. TSCR includes the system-wide Pillar 1 requirements plus the bank-specific Pillar 2 requirements that is the outcome of the SREP assessment.\n17\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nities proxies for banks\u2019 funding preferences (Deposit Ratio). Finally, the RWA density (Density), calculated as the ratio between total RWA and total exposures, controls for banks\u2019 risk profile. The control variables are lagged by one quarter to reduce possible endogeneity concerns. We also include the interactions between each control variable and the treatment period. These interactions partial out the effect of observable covariates on banks\u2019 lending and ensure that the coefficient of main interest (\u03b21) is not driven by banks\u2019 heterogeneity.\nTo account for any remaining unobservable factors, we use different sets of fixed effects\n(FE). First, we include bank fixed-effects (\u03b3i) to control for unobserved firm fundamentals that are not captured via Xi,t\u22121. Furthermore, we progressively saturate our bank-level regressions with time FE and, in our richest specification, with country\u00d7time fixed effects (\u03b3cxt) to control for demand effects (Kok et al., 2021). 20 Demand fixed-effects are necessary to account for demand-driven differences across European banks. This is especially important in light of the great heterogeneity in terms of government responses across Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have resulted in different demand conditions. \u03f5 is the error term. Bertrand et al. (2004) show that the persistence of the treatment variable in a DiD setup induces serial correlation in the regression error within treated units. To adjust for this serial correlation, we cluster standard errors at the bank level."

To control for any demand factor and assess whether the changes in lending are due to a supply effect, we restrict our sample to firms with multiple-lending relationships, in line with the Khwaja and Mian (2008) approach. Specifically, our sample is constituted by companies that borrow at the same time from (at least) one IRB bank and (at least) one SA banks. By focusing on multiple-lending relationships and including borrower \u00d7 time FE (\u03b3b\u00d7t), we control for any time-varying unobserved borrowers\u2019 characteristics and potential changes in the credit demand at the level of the borrower. This empirical setting allows us to isolate credit supply changes from shifts in loan demand generated by a demand shock during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vector of bank characteristics (Xi,t\u22121) includes those specified for Eq.(1). We augment the model by adding an additional control (Wi,j,t\u22121) capturing the size of the large exposures of bank i toward borrower j relative to the size of the NFCs portfolio of bank i (Exp Size). \u03b3i are bank fixed-effects, \u03b3b\u00d7t are borrower \u00d7 quarter fixed-effects, and \u03f5 is the error term.\nFinally, given that an exposure is classified as \u201clarge\u201d if it is above a specific threshold\n(i.e., %10 Tier 1 ratio or above EUR 300 million), it may be the case that the bank-firm relationship is not observed throughout the six quarters considered for our analyses (i.e., the relationship is not observed if the value of the exposure falls below the threshold(s)).

In Panel C, we report the summary statistics of our control variables. IRB banks show (on average) a greater size than SA banks.

Overall, our results suggest that, following the eruption of the pandemic in March 2020, there are differences in the growth of credit exposures between banks adopting an IRB or a SA approach. In particular, banks using IRB models reduced their credit growth compared to banks using the SA approach. The growth rate of credit origination to NFCs declined between 1.35% and 1.86% more in IRB banks compared to SA. We obtain very similar results for the growth rate of on-balance sheet exposures (between 1.44% and 2.32%), and total loans and advances (between 1.62% and 2.45%) to NFCs. We notice that controlling for demand effects - by adding country\u00d7 time fixed effects - reduces the magnitude of the coefficients, but not their significance.\n[Insert Table 3 here]\nAll models include the interactions between the treatment period variable and each\nof the control variables (Post\u00d7 Size, Post\u00d7Distance, Post\u00d7ROA, Post\u00d7Dep Ratio, and Post\u00d7Density respectively). The inclusion of these interactions enables us to control for the possibility that IRB banks might have realized the disruptive effects of COVID19 on the economy before SA banks, resulting in IRB banks cutting their lending faster than other banks. The quicker reaction can be explained by the fact that IRB banks are usually larger and have a significantly more developed risk management departments. Interestingly, we find no evidence supporting the notion that banks\u2019 size, capitalization, profitability and RWA density played a significant role after the eruption of the pandemic. In the entire set of analyses at the bank-level (Table 3), these interactions are insignificant in explaining credit exposures growth. Conversely, we find evidence that credit exposures generally increased after the COVID-19 for banks with higher shares of deposit funding. Indeed, the term Post \u00d7 Dep Ratio is always found positive and strongly significant, suggesting that banks with a more stable funding base were able to better withstand the liquidity shock caused by the COVID-19 eruption and therefore maintained the capacity\n22\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nto continue to extend credit.\nTo gain a complete picture of the dynamics at play during the pandemic, we also\nexplore banks\u2019 behaviour with respect to i) exposures other than to NFCs and, ii) offbalance sheet exposures. The results of these additional analyses are reported in Tables A5 and A6 in the Appendix, respectively. We do not find evidence that IRB banks have changed their lending behaviour toward counterparts that are not classified as NFCs. Likewise, IRB banks did not change their off-balance sheet credit exposures relative to SA banks.\nAll the specifications are saturated with bank fixed effects together with time or\ncountry \u00d7 time fixed effects to control for changes in credit demand induced by the pandemic shock. As such, this set of analyses provides the first evidence that the reduction in credit growth was supply driven. IRB banks dropped more their overall, on-balance sheet and loan exposures after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to banks using the standardised approach. This behaviour involved only NFCs exposures, while other counterparties did not suffer the same reduction (see Table A5 in the Appendix)."

Our identification strategy is based on the usual selection criteria (IRB vs. SA banks), but we employ loan-level data on \u201clarge exposures\u201d to capture the net effect of banks\u2019 actions on the supply of loans, while holding borrowers\u2019 characteristics constant. We focus on large exposures as they absorb the largest amount of bank capital, and thus we could rationally expect that, after the COVID-19 shock, banks tried to adjust their asset position starting from these exposures.21\n21As defined by BIS (2018), large exposures are the sum of all exposures of a bank to a single counterparty that are equal to or above 10% of its Tier 1 capital. Banks also have to report to national supervisors: (a) all other exposures that would have been a large exposure without considering the effect of credit risk\n23\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nEstimates for Eq.(2) are reported in Table 4. In Panel A, we focus first on on-balance\nsheet exposures (columns 1 to 3), and total loans and securities (columns 4 to 6) to NFCs. In Panel B, we focus on off-balance sheet exposures (columns 1 to 3), and loan commitments (columns 4 and 6) to NFCs. As for the previous models, the coefficient of main interest is for the interaction Post \u00d7 IRBi, capturing the effect of higher capital requirements induced by model-based regulation due to COVID-19 pandemic for IRB banks on lending to large corporates.\nThe results reported in Panel A confirm the findings obtained using bank-level data.\nWe show a substantial decline in on-balance sheet exposures (between 8.45% and 10.35%) and loans and securities exposures (between 11.00% and 13.29%), suggesting that IRB banks have a lower growth rate of exposures relative to SA banks. The decrease in exposures corresponds to an average lending drop per bank of about e7.2 billion.\nThe findings for off-balance sheet large exposures (Panel B of Table 4) show an op-\nposite situation. IRB banks reacted to the shock by increasing more their off-balance sheet credit exposures (between 6.97% and 9.05%), and especially loan commitments (between 16.49% and 20.50%) to NFCs, relative to SA banks. These positions do not directly absorb regulatory capital and, thus, we show that IRB banks supported NFCs during the COVID-19 outbreak by increasing off-balance sheet exposures and gaining higher fees without an immediate impact on equity.\nBy using a sample of multiple-lending relationships that enables us to control for\nborrower demand, this second set of results provides further evidence that the contraction in on-balance sheet and loans extended by IRB banks compared to SA banks is the result of a bank decision. That is, the lower credit growth is due to a supply-side effect rather than a demand shock.\nIn Section 3, we have shown that, following the outbreak of the pandemic in March\nmitigation or exemption clauses; (b) the 20 largest exposures even if they do not satisfy the definition of a large exposure.\n24\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\n2020, IRB banks reacted by recognising the increase in the riskiness of the borrowers and deleveraging via a reduction of their exposures to NFCs. This behaviour of IRB banks is observed both at the portfolio level (i.e., when using bank-level data) and at the level of individual exposures (i.e., when employing the \u201clarge exposures\u201d data). These results support the presence of tensions between micro- and macro-prudential policies\u2019 objectives. Indeed, from a micro-prudential point of view, these results suggest that IRB models support the financial soundness of banks by increasing the risk sensitiveness of capital requirements. However, from a macro-prudential perspective, the deleveraging of banks might have exacerbated the crisis via the contraction in the credit supply to firms.\n[Insert Table 4 here]"

            "text": "To test whether our results are driven by banks\u2019 levels of capital, we restrict our sample to banks using IRB models that are similar vis-a\u0300-vis the supervisory authority\u2019s eyes, having their internal models been scrutinized and validated. In this setting, both the treatment and control groups of banks registered an increase in their RWA after the COVID-19 eruption. We argue that IRB banks operating with capital levels well above the minimum regulatory requirements have the option to decide whether to maintain their credit exposures (meeting increased capital requirements and covering losses with the capital surplus) or reduce lending. Conversely, IRB banks operating with capital levels close to the minimum regulatory requirements did not have the option to maintain the same credit exposures (being short of equity to satisfy the increased capital requirements) and were forced to reduce lending in a pandemic scenario. This alternative identification enables us to account for the fact that IRB banks and SA banks may have some fundamental differences that are affecting our results. For example, IRB banks may have greater access to an internal capital market and better survive in times of crisis (as shown by Santioni et al. (2020) for the global financial crisis).\nOur identification is straightforward. Our treatment (control) group includes banks\nreporting a distance between their CET1 ratio and their Total SREP Capital Requirement (TSCR) below (above) the first quartile of the distribution (LowCap) in the pre-pandemic period (as of 2019Q4). As such, we replicate the loan-level analysis by running the model in Eq.(2) using this alternative identification strategy. As per Section 3.3, our sample\n26\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nrelies on multiple-lending relationships, where we impose the condition that the borrower has to be associated with (at least) one bank with a low capital buffer and (at least) one bank with a high capital buffer.\nAs a first step, we test whether the parallel trend assumption between the treatment\nand control groups holds. We compare the quarterly growth of credit exposures (onbalance sheet and loans) to NFCs for IRB banks with a low- and high-distance from TSCR. Table 5 reports the results using difference-in-means estimations prior to the COVID-19 shock. Banks in the control and treatment groups are largely statistically indistinguishable in the run-up to the COVID-19 eruption.\n[Insert Table 5 here]\nWe estimate the impact of model-based regulation using this new identification strat-\negy and report the results in Table 6. Low capitalised IRB banks have lower growth rates of on-balance sheet credit exposures (between 2.94% and 3.86%) and loans and securities (between 5.75% and -6.78%) relative to IRB banks with higher buffers (Panel A of Table 6). These findings confirm our hypothesis that IRB banks with capital well above their TSCR requirements were able to support their lending to firms during a pandemic, while capital constrained IRB banks were forced to reduce their exposures to avoid violating minimum capital requirements.\n[Insert Table 6 here]\nAs a first robustness check, we replicate this analysis on the pool of SA banks. In-\ntuitively, if the reduction in lending is the outcome of the use of IRB models, we do not expect any difference between SA banks with different levels of capital buffers. This is because the SA approach is not-risk sensitive and thus the pandemic would produce the same effect on both groups of banks. As shown in Table A7 (in the Appendix), our results do not imply any statistically significant difference between highly and poorly capitalized SA banks in terms of credit provision during the COVID-19, supporting our argument\n27\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nthat internal models are driving the impact on bank lending.\nWe further enrich our analysis by exploring the possibility that capital constrained\nIRB banks selected the borrowers to which reducing credit. Specifically, we investigate three sources of heterogeneity: i) the capital absorption of each specific exposure, ii) borrowers\u2019 industry (COVID-19 affected vs non-affected sectors), and iii) borrowers\u2019 country (domestic vs. non-domestic). First, we study whether IRB banks selectively reduced exposures with higher capital absorption. To this end, we augment the DiD specification of Eq.(2) with a triple interaction term capturing the riskiness of the loan (Post\u00d7LowCap\u00d7CRM). Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) techniques refer to institutions\u2019 guarantees, credit derivatives, on-balance sheet netting and financial collateral agreements used to reduce the credit risk associated with an exposure. Using \u201clarge exposures\u201d data, we are able to calculate a CRM factor for each loan exposure by dividing the value of the exposure after the application of CRM factors by its total original value. To exemplify this, a CRM value of 1 implies that the exposure does not benefit from any credit risk mitigation, and the entire original value of the exposure needs to be considered for the calculation of capital requirements.22 We use the CRM factor calculated as of 2019Q2 as a proxy for the riskiness of the credit exposures pre-shock, where the higher the CRM, the riskier is the exposure.\nPanel A of Table 7 reports the DiD results when controlling for the influence of\nthe CRM factor, where the main coefficient of interest is the triple interaction Postt \u00d7 LowCapi \u00d7 CRMj . We observe a negative and statistical significant coefficient for loans and securities (column 1), implying that, after March 2020, low capitalized IRB banks cut more than highly capitalized IRB banks their exposures towards borrowers absorbing relatively more capital. This result is consistent with the notion that model-based capital regulation might induce procyclicality in bank lending. Banks\u2019 internal ratings\n22For example, if we observe in our data an original credit exposure of e100 million, which becomes e80 after the application of CRM, this implies a CRM factor of 0.8.\n28\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nfor borrowers (e.g., PDs) deteriorate swiftly following adverse macroeconomic scenarios, especially during crisis times. The deteriorated parameters feeding into their regulatory models cause higher capital absorption of that exposures and might incentivize banks to cut back on lending. At the same time, we show that this reaction also depends on the level of capital headroom when the shock hits.\nIn a similar fashion, we run a triple DiD to explore whether IRB banks close to their\nTSCR targeted the economic sectors to which reducing their exposures. Focusing on the triple interaction Postt \u00d7 LowCapi \u00d7 Most Affectedj , the variable Most Affected is a dummy variable taking the value of one if the borrower belongs to one of the sectors identified by the European Banking Authority (2020) as being the most affected by the pandemic, including: Manufacturing; energy supplier, construction, wholesale and retail trade; accommodation and food services; transport and storage; business and administrative activities; arts, entertainment and recreation.23 Not surprisingly, the results in Panel B of Table 7 show that, after March 2020, capital-constrained IRB banks have decreased their loans and securities exposures more than highly capitalized banks (column 1) towards the most affected sectors of the economy.\nFinally, the third dimension investigated is the country where the borrower is head-\nquartered. Specifically, we explore whether, following a shock, banks differentiate between domestic and non-domestic borrowers. To this end, in Panel C of Table 7, we include a triple interaction (PosttimesLowCapi \u00d7Domesticj) where Domesticj takes the value of one if the headquarter of the firm coincides with the country where the bank is headquartered, and zero otherwise. Interestingly, we do not find any evidence of retrenchment. Unlike other studies (Giannetti and Laeven, 2012), there is no evidence of a flight home or portfolio re-balancing towards banks\u2019 domestic market after the COVID-19 shock.\n[Insert Table 7 here]\n23Given this classification, the borrowers with the following NACE codes as classified as \u201chigh risk\u201d and thus take the value of one: C,D,F,G,H,I,N,R.\n29\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nTo sum up, our triple DiD analyses show that the decline in lending of IRB banks\noperating close to their TSCR relative to IRB banks with higher capital did not affect all borrowers, rather it was concentrated on credit exposures with a limited impact of credit risk mitigation techniques, and credit exposures toward borrowers in the economic sectors most affected by the pandemic. As such, IRB model worked as intended by microprudential supervisors by identifying correctly the most risky counterparties and reducing their exposures towards them. Nonetheless, the reaction of IRB banks might rise macro-prudential concerns if - by contracting lending to these borrowers - the crisis is exacerbated."

            "text": "In this section, we test whether the different features of IRB models influence banks\u2019 reactions to the pandemic shock. IRB models for credit risk are complex models based on several parameters, including the Probability of Default (PD), the Loss Given Default (LGD), the Exposure at Default (EAD), and the Maturity (M). These parameters give an assessment on the riskiness of the borrower and the potential loss the bank has to bear in case the borrower defaults. In detail, the Basel Committee proposes two types of IRB methodology. In the \u201cFoundation\u201d framework, regulators authorize banks to calculate risk-weights using their assessment of borrowers\u2019 PD, while the remaining parameters are derived through the application of standardised supervisory rules. By contrast, in the \u201cAdvanced\u201d framework, the supervisory authorities permit banks to determine the riskweights using internal models where all the parameters (i.e., PD, LGS, M, EAD) are internally calculated.\nAmong the different parameters envisaged by the IRB models, we focus on the Down-\nturn LGD, which is a specific LGD measure used as risk parameter in the Basel II/III\n30\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nregulatory framework.24 In simple words, the downturn LGD is the expected LGD during downturn periods (i.e., during crises). Banks estimating a downturn LGD use historical datasets of economic indicators of at least the most recent 20 years including downturn periods and thus have elevated levels of realised LGD. Intuitively, banks including a downturn LGD in their IRB models should be more resilient to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic since their risk-weights are on average higher than those of banks not using a downturn LGD which, instead, would suffer a quicker increase in risk-weights from March 2020.\nFor this analysis, we obtain confidential information on the banks participating in\nthe Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM).25 Our treatment group includes banks that use a downturn LGD (DLGD) in their IRB model, while the control group comprises all IRB banks (both banks under the foundation and the advanced framework) not using the DLGD parameter. As usual, we replicate the loan-level analysis (as illustrated in Section 2.3) by running the model in Eq.(2). As per Section 3.3, our estimation exploits multiple-lending relationships, where we impose the condition that the borrower has to be associated with (at least) one bank using downturn LGD and (at least) one bank that does not use it. Table 8 illustrates the test for the parallel trend assumption between these two groups of banks, confirming that there are no differences in their lending patterns before the COVID-19 shock.\n[Insert Table 8 here]\nThe results reported in Table 9 show that IRB banks using a downturn LGD were able\nto increase credit exposures to borrowers more than banks in the control group (between 4.14% and 6.44%) and the difference is mainly due to loans and securities (between 5.45% and 6.45%). We do not find differences in off-balance sheet credit exposures. As a ro-\n24The European Banking Authority published in March 2019 its guidelines specifying how institutions should quantify the appropriate LGD estimation in an economic downturn.\n25TRIM is a multi-year project carried out by the Single Supervisory Mechanism aimed at assessing the compliance to regulatory requirements of IRB models used by Significant Institutions.\n31\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nbustness check, we restrict the control group to IRB banks under the advanced framework only. The results in Table A8 in the Appendix fully confirm our findings.\nThese results confirm our expectation that IRB banks including a downturn LGD in\ntheir IRB models are better equipped to deal with severe adverse events than those banks not incorporating this parameter. It follows that these banks could lend more (or drop lending less) relative to banks not using a downturn LGD when a shock occurs. Thus, the downturn LGD parameter could alleviate the tensions between micro- and macroprudential objectives arising during economic downturns.\n[Insert Table 9 here]"

            "text": "In this final set of estimations, we consider alternative channels that may explain the documented negative link between the use of model-based regulation and the drop in lending activities after the COVID-19 eruption. A first concern is that IRB banks are more sophisticated than SA banks, and, as such, they incorporated the COVID-19 negative effects earlier. Thus, one could argue that the observed lending drop is not due to the adoption of IRB models, but rather it is a consequence of better risk management skills. A second issue is related to the fact that IRB models generate a pro-cyclical effect and thus the lending drop after the COVID-19 is a rather mechanical consequence - more than a bank\u2019s decision to reduce its credit exposure - due to banks having experienced a credit boom before the start of the pandemic. A third concern is related to the possible worsening of the quality of the borrowers and the presence of zombie lending. After the start of the pandemic, banks may have decided to carry-on lending activities towards large borrowers even if these became too risky (zombie) and thus the drop observed is biased. We address these concerns in the following subsections.\n32\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670"

The results from re-running the model in Eq.(1) with the new pre-treatment period are reported in Table 10. Our results strongly confirm the observed decline in credit supply by IRB banks compared to SA banks after March 2020 suggesting that the difference is not due to a quicker reaction of IRB banks to COVID-19, rather it is a persistent effect over the entire 2020, and suggests that the effect is driven by the use of internal models contributing to the pro-cyclicality of lending.\n[Insert Table 10 here]"

However, we do not find statistical evidence that this effect differs for banks located in countries that were at different phases of the credit cycle before the pandemic.

To retrieve this information,\n26In each sub-sample, we include bank-borrower relationship among banks in that same group of countries.

In other words, we exclude from the estimation those borrowers with relative lower quality. We estimate our usual DiD model and report the results in Table 12. The decline in credit exposure and in particular in loans and securities granted remains more pronounced for IRB banks compared to SA banks even when restricting the sample to high quality borrowers.

From the point of view of micro-prudential supervisors, these behaviours of banks are exactly what envisaged and intended by the regulatory framework. In this section, we conclude the paper by showing how the reduction in credit supply of IRB banks compared to SA banks generated a negative economic impact on the corporations involved and thus on the overall real economy. That is, we provide evidence of how micro-prudential approaches can have macro-prudential consequences. As such, this issue is particularly important to inform policy makers that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, had to devise policies to support funding to corporates and households to smooth the negative effects on the economy.\n36\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nConcerning in particular the issue that we are studying, the lower credit granted from IRB banks may be compensated in case of a large shock by greater funding from SA banks, or by more funding from other sources, like bondholders and shareholders.28\nTo this aim, we collected accounting data from the Orbis database for the sample\nof NFCs borrowers analysed in the previous sections over the period 2015-2020, and we matched this information with the funding that NFCs obtained from IRB and SA banks reported in the ECB supervisory information on large exposures. Specifically, we first construct a borrower-level proxy to capture firm\u2019s dependency on IRB funding. This variable is calculated as the ratio of funds granted by IRB banks over total assets of the firm (IRB Ratio). We rank corporations according to this variable and divide the distribution in terciles. We define a dummy variable (IRB Ratio dummy) taking the value of one for borrowers that are more credit dependent on IRB banks (the third tercile of the IRB Ratio distribution) and zero for NFCs relying less on funding from IRB banks (the first tercile of the IRB Ratio distribution). Our identification strategy is based on a following model:\nLog(Y )j,t = \u03b21IRBratiodummyj,t + \u03b22IRBratiodummyj,t \u00d7 Postt\n+ \u03b23IssuedCapitalj,t + \u03b24IssuedCapitalj,t \u00d7 Postt + \u03b25Reservecapitalj,t + \u03b26Reservecapitalj,t \u00d7 Postt + \u03b27MostAffectedj + \u03b28MostAffectedj \u00d7 Postt+ + \u03b29Xj,t\u22121 + \u03b3j + \u03b3t + \u03f5j,t\n(3)\nwhere our dependent variable (Log(Y )j,t) is the log of various assets items for the borrower j at time t. We use various measures of assets - debtors receivables, other current assets, tangible fixed assets, and non-tangible fixed assets - to gain a broad understanding of the\n28As shown in the introduction, large exposures were not supported via governments guarantees during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n37\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nimpact that a shock to IRB funding during the COVID-19 generated on borrowers.29\nFor the purpose of this analysis, we focus on three main coefficients of interest in\nEq.(3). The first (\u03b22) is the coefficient of the interaction between the IRB Ratio dummy and the post-COVID dummy and it captures whether borrowers, whose funding depended more on IRB banks, dropped their investment in 2020 compared to other borrowers (i.e., all NFCs before the COVID-19 or NFCs relying less on IRB banks\u2019 funding). The second coefficient of interest (\u03b24) is the interaction between issued capital (i.e., the log of common equity) and the post-COVID dummy. This coefficient shows whether borrowers\u2019 investments in 2020 were financed via equity issuance. The third coefficient of interest (\u03b26) is the interaction between reserve capital (i.e., the log of equity reserves), and the post-COVID dummy, capturing whether in 2020 the investments of these NFCs were funded by using equity reserves. The model is saturated with a vector of firm characteristics (Xj,t\u22121) affecting borrowers\u2019 assets, including the log of the operating turnover and the capital ratio (both measured with 1-year lag), the number of banks the corporation is borrowing from and a dummy with a value of one if the firm is listed. We also control for the firm being part of the industries most affected by the pandemic (Most Affected\u00d7 Post).\nOur estimates (Table 14) show that IRB-dependent corporates dropped their invest-\nments more relative to other borrowers in 2020. The coefficients are statistically significant for short-term financial investment (trade receivables), tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed-assets. These results suggest that the previously documented decrease in credit granted by IRB banks induced more IRB dependent borrowers to reduce the selling of goods and services on credit (this enables NFCs to reduce funding needs and also increase cash inflow from selling). Similarly, these borrowers dropped investments in patents, copyrights, trademarks, franchise rights and other intangible assets that NFCs normally increase in good times, when funds are more easily available. Furthermore, the same\n29We also replicate the model using the number of employees and various performance measures.\n38\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nborrowers did not acquire tangible assets in 2020.\nInterestingly, we document that investments in receivables and tangible fixed assets\nwere supported in 2020 by the usage of capital reserves (the interaction Reserve Capital\u00d7 Post is negative), instead of resorting to other financing options. Conversely, the coefficient related to the issuance of new shares is not statistically significant, suggesting that borrowers faced difficulties in raising equity on a short notice in exceptional times. The results confirm that, in times of crises, large borrowers support their assets using their capital reserves. Overall, the results of Section 6 our provide important insights for policy makers. Model based regulation is able to achieve micro-prudential objectives by providing banks with risk sensitive estimates, but at the same time, it produced substantial negative effects on borrowers during the COVID-19, especially in tangible investments.\n[Insert Table 14 here]"

The outcome variables are: credit origination (on and off-balance sheet exposures) to non-financial corporations (columns 1 and 2), on-balance sheet exposures to non-financial corporations (columns 3 and 4), and loans to non-financial corporations (columns 5 and 6). The outcome variables are expressed as quarterly growth rates (Log(Yi,t) \u2212 Log(Yi,t\u22121)). Postt takes the value of one for the period 2020Q2-2020Q3 and zero for 2019Q2-2020Q1. IRBi takes the value of one for banks reporting corporate credit risk using internal models and zero if the banks use the standardised approach. Bank-level controls include the natural logarithm of assets (Size), the distance from the TSCR requirements (Distance), Return on Assets (ROA), Deposit Ratio (Dep Ratio), and RWA Density (Density). See Table A3 for the definition of the variables. We only show estimates for the interaction terms (Postt \u00d7Xi,t\u22121).

The distance measure is constructed as the difference between banks\u2019 reported CET1 ratio and their TSCR requirement (Pillar 1 + Pillar 2 requirements). Banks are classified as \u201cLow\u201d if their distance is below the first quartile of the distribution as of 2019Q4 (i.e., banks with the lowest buffers) and as \u201cHigh\u201d otherwise. In Panel A, the means refer to the average quarterly growth rates (Log(Yi,j,t)\u2212 Log(Yi,j,t\u22121)) of On-Balance Sheet exposures over the four quarters pre-shock (i.e., 2019Q2-2020Q1). In Panel B, the means refer to Loans & Securities over the same period. The last column reports the difference in means between High and Low capitalized banks. *, **, and *** indicate the significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels of the t-test for whether the difference in means between the groups is equal to zero.\nVariable Time Obs High Obs Low Mean High Mean Low Diff Panel A.

The sample is restricted to multiple-lending relationships, where the borrower is associated with at least one IRB bank classified as \u201cLow\u201d and one IRB bank as \u201cHigh\u201d distance from capital requirements. The outcome variables are the quarterly growth rates of loans & securities (column 1), and loan commitments (column 2). Postt takes the value of one for the period 2020Q2-2020Q3 and zero for 2019Q2-2020Q1. LowCapi takes the value of one for banks in the first quartile of the distance between CET1 Ratio and their TSCR requirement, and zero otherwise. In Panel A, CRMj is a continuous variable calculated as the value of the exposure after the application of CMR of bank i to borrower j in 2019Q2 divided by the value of the original exposure. In Panel B, Most Affectedj takes the value of one for those borrowers belonging to the NACE sectors: C,D,F,G,H,I,N,R. In Panel C, Domesticj takes the value of one if the borrower and the bank are headquartered in the same country.

The sample is restricted to multiple-lending relationships, where the borrower is associated with at least one bank that uses the downturn LGD parameter in its IRB model and one that does not. In Panel A, the outcome variables are total on-balance sheet exposures (columns 1 to 3), and loans & securities (columns 4 to 6). In Panel B, the outcome variables are total off-balance sheet exposures (columns 1 to 3), and loans commitments (columns 4 to 6). The outcome variables are expressed in the quarterly growth rates (Log(Yi,j,t) \u2212 Log(Yi,j,t\u22121)). DLGD takes the value of one for banks that use the downturn LGD parameter in their IRB models, and zero for banks (both under the foundation and advanced IRB framework) that do not use it. Bank-level controls include the natural logarithm of assets (Size), distance from the CET1 capital requirements (Distance), Return on Assets (ROA), Deposit Ratio (Dep Ratio), RWA Density (Density), and the relative size of the large exposure (Exp size). See Table A3 for the definition of the variables. We only show estimates for the interaction terms (Postt \u00d7 Xi,t\u22121).

Panel A refers to the main identification strategy where the sample is restricted to multiple-lending relationships where the borrower is associated with at least one SA and one IRB bank. Panel B refers to the alternative identification strategy, where the sample includes borrowers associated with at least one IRB bank classified as \u201cLow\u201d and one IRB banks as \u201cHigh\u201d distance from capital requirements. Borrowers with probability of default or days of past due in the last 10th percentile of the empirical distribution were excluded. The outcome variables are loans & securities (columns 1 to 3) and loans commitments (columns 4 to 6).

For each bank i Public Guarantees is a continuous variable calculated as the share of loans covered by a public guarantee over the total amount of loans. The outcome variable is the quarterly growth rates of loans & securities. Postt takes the value of one for the period 2020Q2-2020Q3 and zero for 2019Q2-2020Q1. LowCapi takes the value of one for banks in the first quartile of the distance between CET1 Ratio and their TSCR requirement, and zero otherwise. For the sake of brevity we show the coefficients on the interactions of main interest. CRMj is a continuous variable calculated as the value of the exposure after the application of CMR of bank i to borrower j in 2019Q2 divided by the value of the original exposure. Most Affectedj takes the value of one for those borrowers belonging to the NACE sectors: C,D,F,G,H,I,N,R. Domesticj takes the value of one if the borrower and the bank are headquartered in the same country. DLGD takes the value of one for banks that use the downturn LGD parameter in their IRB models, and zero for banks (both under the foundation and advanced IRB framework) that do not use it. Bank-level controls include include the natural logarithm of assets, distance from the CET1 capital requirements, Return on Assets, Deposit Ratio, RWA Density and the relative size of the large exposure. The estimates for the control variables are available upon request to the authors. Clustered standard errors at bank-level in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.\nLoans & Securities Loans & Securities\n(1) (2)\nPanel A: Table 6 re-estimation (High vs Low capitalised) Postt \u00d7 LowCapi -0.0678\u2217\u2217\u2217 -0.0605\u2217\u2217 (0.0241) (0.0253) Panel B: Table 7 re-estimation (Triple interactions) Postt \u00d7 LowCapi \u00d7 CRMj -0.1043\u2217\u2217 -0.1076\u2217\u2217 (0.0474) (0.0523) Postt \u00d7 LowCapi \u00d7Most Affectedj -0.0675\u2217\u2217\u2217 -0.0916\u2217\u2217\u2217 (0.0196) (0.0215) Postt \u00d7 LowCapi \u00d7Domesticj 0.0443 0.0254 (0.0639) (0.0483) Panel C: Table 9 re-estimation (DLGD) Postt \u00d7DLGDi 0.0545\u2217 0.0341\u2217 (0.0270) (0.0197) Public Guarantees control No Yes Bank FE Yes Yes Borrower \u00d7 Time FE Yes Yes\n69\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4307670\nLeibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE | www.safe-frankfurt.de | info@safe-frankfurt.de\nRecent Issues\nNo. 373 Emily Kormanyos, Tobin Hanspal, Andreas Hackethal\nDo Gamblers Invest in Lottery Stocks?\nNo. 372 Alessandro Pollastri, Paulo Rodrigues, Christian Schlag, Norman Seeger\nA Jumping Index of Jumping Stocks?
