 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Study the adsorption behavior of specific protein species on different polymer coatings. The current work uses a generic protein model, so it would be interesting to look at real proteins like BSA or lysozyme on coatings like PHEMA, PEG, etc. 

2. Investigate the effect of protein shape and flexibility on adsorption. The current model uses rigid spherical proteins. Exploring how protein geometry and conformational changes affect adsorption could provide new insights.

3. Examine competitive adsorption between multiple protein species. The paper studies adsorption of a single protein type, but complex mixtures could lead to different adsorption patterns. 

4. Develop more advanced polymer brush models. The simple bead-spring model could be expanded to include features like polydispersity, grafted chain interactions, or stimuli-responsive polymers.

5. Study kinetics of protein adsorption/desorption. The current work focuses on equilibrium behavior, but analyzing the dynamics of proteins attaching and detaching could reveal factors controlling adsorption rates.
