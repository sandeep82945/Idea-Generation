 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Develop efficient algorithms to decompose arbitrary unitary matrices into tensor products of smaller unitary matrices. This could lead to more practical methods for determining LU equivalence.

2. Investigate conditions and methods for LU equivalence when density matrices are degenerate. The current paper focuses on non-degenerate states.

3. Explore applications of LU equivalence, such as using it as an entanglement measure or for quantum state discrimination.

4. Find new families of LU invariants, using the property described in the paper. A complete set of LU invariants has many uses in quantum information.

5. Extend the ideas to other classes of operations, like stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC). This could provide insights into entanglement under broader operational settings.
