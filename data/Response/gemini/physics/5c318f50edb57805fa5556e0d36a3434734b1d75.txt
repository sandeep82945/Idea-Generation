1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the phytochemicals in Myrtus communis L. (MC) to identify the functional groups or structural features responsible for their anti-ChE activity.** This could be done by synthesizing and testing a series of analogs of the most active phytochemicals, and then analyzing the data to identify the key structural features that contribute to their activity. This information could then be used to design new, more potent anti-ChE agents.


2. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the most promising phytochemicals from MC in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD).** This would involve administering the phytochemicals to animals with AD-like symptoms and then assessing their effects on cognitive function, neuropathology, and other relevant endpoints. This would provide valuable information about the potential of these phytochemicals to treat AD in humans.


3. **Investigate the potential of the phytochemicals from MC to inhibit other enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of AD, such as beta-secretase and tau kinase.** This could be done using in vitro assays or animal models, and would help to identify new targets for the development of AD therapeutics.


4. **Explore the potential of the phytochemicals from MC to protect against neurotoxicity induced by amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau, the two main protein aggregates found in the brains of people with AD.** This could be done using in vitro or in vivo models of Aβ- and tau-induced neurotoxicity, and would provide valuable information about the potential of these phytochemicals to prevent or slow the progression of AD.


5. **Investigate the potential of the phytochemicals from MC to improve cognitive function in healthy individuals.** This could be done by conducting clinical trials in healthy adults, and would provide information about the potential of these phytochemicals to enhance memory, attention, and other cognitive functions.
