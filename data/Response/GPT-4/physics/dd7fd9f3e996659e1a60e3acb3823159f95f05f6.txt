Exploring Other Natural Surfactants and Oil Phases: Building on the concept of using natural surfactants and oil phases for creating nanoemulsions, future studies could investigate the use of other traditional medicinal plants or natural compounds as surfactants or oil phases. This exploration could aim to enhance the bioactivity, stability, or skin permeability of the nanoemulsions for broader pharmaceutical, cosmetic, or therapeutic applications.

Mechanism of Action Studies: While the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of the BB-TTO nanoemulsion were highlighted, the exact mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Future research could focus on detailed molecular studies to understand how these nanoemulsions interact with microbial cells and human tissues at the cellular and molecular levels, potentially identifying specific pathways or targets involved in their therapeutic effects.

Formulation Optimization for Specific Applications: The paper outlines a general formulation that exhibits promising antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. Further studies could optimize these nanoemulsions for specific applications, such as wound healing, acne treatment, or chronic inflammatory conditions, by tweaking the formulation (e.g., oil phase concentration, surfactant type) to enhance efficacy and safety for these specific contexts.

Long-term Stability and Scalability Studies: The study demonstrates the nanoemulsion's stability over 120 days. Future research could extend these findings by exploring the long-term stability under different storage conditions and temperatures. Additionally, scalability studies could be conducted to assess the feasibility of large-scale production, addressing challenges such as cost-effectiveness, quality control, and environmental impact.

Clinical Trials and Safety Evaluation: Lastly, translating the promising in vitro and animal model results into clinical benefits requires rigorous clinical trials. Future research efforts could focus on conducting phase I-III clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and potential side effects of BB-TTO nanoemulsions in humans. This would involve comparing the nanoemulsion's therapeutic effects against existing treatments for bacterial infections and inflammatory conditions.
