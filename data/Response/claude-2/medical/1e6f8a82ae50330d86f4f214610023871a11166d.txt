 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate using different machine learning methods in the ensemble model like XGBoost, LSTM neural networks, etc. The paper currently uses MLP, RBF, LR, SVR, RF and SR but there are many other advanced ML methods that could be explored.

2. Apply feature selection techniques like PCA, autoencoders, genetic algorithms etc. to reduce the input feature space and improve computational efficiency of the models. The paper uses a manual trial and error approach for input variable selection.

3. Evaluate the model ensemble approach for longer-term load forecasting horizons like 1 week or 1 month ahead. The current paper focuses on horizons up to 24 hours. Longer horizons bring additional challenges.

4. Incorporate additional input variables like electricity pricing data, special event calendars, demographic information etc. along with the weather and past load data. More diverse inputs could improve model accuracy.

5. Deploy and evaluate the ensemble model on a larger scale using data from multiple substations across a region. This could help assess model robustness and scalability for real-world implementation.
