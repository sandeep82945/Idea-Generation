Each individual\nhad both something to offer and something to gain during the process. Staff identified\nchallenges in the co-production process; in that balancing all the voices during\nmeetings could be complex at times, and the process overall required considerable\ntime commitment.\nConclusion: Taking part in co-production at an appropriate level and with peer\nsupport is a relational activity seen to be valuable in powerfully, yet gently, challenging\nstigma and assumptions around dementia. Findings show that while the process of co-\nproduction requires time and dedication, there is overall value in involving people living\nwith dementia both in co-production and in peer support. This provided a straightforward\nand beneficial means to inclusively improve post-diagnosis support and care quality\nwithin a memory service.\nKeywords: dementia, recovery, co-production, peer support, mental health, service improvement"

            "text": "The UK National Dementia Strategy (1) includes the objective of facilitating people with dementia and their families to engage in structured peer support and learning networks, enabling their active participation in improving local health services. In mental health dementia service improvement, facilitating people to \u201cparticipate actively\u201d means finding practical ways to draw on and value views from lived experience of people with dementia, and their family supporters. This lived knowledge is now used to inform individual care planning and to directly influence service or organisational level improvements (2). This element of a person-centred approach to dementia care (3) is frequently overlooked in everyday practice. Generally, involving people with dementia consists of consultation. This can be \u201ctokenistic\u201d if contributing does not change anything (4), it happens as a \u201cone off\u201d when a service is being re-configured (5) or it merely measures \u201cpatient experience\u201d (6). In contrast, co-production is defined as an optimum level of engagement meaning people who use and people who work in public services share power to improve quality of services (4). For people living with dementia, actively participating in co-production (4) with appropriate support, to improve services, can help challenge negative stereotypes about dementia while improving care outcomes (7). The term \u201cco-production\u201d applied in its fullest sense in mental health, refers to true partnership working where staff and people with lived experience share power to plan, design and lead service improvements from the outset (8). The Dementia Engagement and Empowerment Project described positive examples of co-production, where groups of people living with dementia lead local and national policy and campaigns to reduce stigmatising language around dementia (9). Nonetheless, involving people with dementia specifically at any level of co-production, remains relatively uncommon, both in practices related to quality improvements of mental health services, and in published literature.\nOne area where co-production is flourishing, is in workingage adult mental health services. A recovery-focused, peersupported approach is widely adopted to extend mental health\ncare delivery outcomes beyond a narrow focus on symptom reduction, to help people rebuild meaningful, satisfying lives\nwhile living with the challenges caused by mental health difficulties (10). Five key concepts underpin the term \u201cprocess of recovery\u201d known as the CHIME framework (11). CHIME stands for connecting with others, inspiring hope,maintaining a positive identity, finding meaning in life beyond symptoms and empowering control over life and focusing on strengths (11). \u201cRecovery Colleges\u201d are adult educational settings for people who access mental health services, their families and staff. The Recovery College model offers co-produced courses to increase attendees\u2019 knowledge, skills and resilience in self-management of their own mental health. The CHIME framework and principles of co-production and peer support are in all aspects of Recovery College course design and delivery (10).\nThere is resonance between the CHIME framework and the value base of person-centred dementia care (7, 12\u201315). Personcentred care is defined as \u201cvaluing people with dementia and\nthose who care for them\u201d (3). To be person-centred, care should be individualised and understandings and actions should be derived from the perspectives of people with dementia. This may create more positive social-psychological environments (3). A UK scoping survey found that mental health organisations are incorporating dementia into Recovery College programmes (16). However, evidence from experiences of co-production with people with dementia in such programmes is scarce; only two published reports were found. Duff (17) reports on processes and possible benefits of using recovery principles in Recovery Colleges in Lincolnshire, suggesting a recovery approach could help reduce demand on services and help to raise quality of life for people with dementia. Cheffey et al. (18) (p 24) describe coproducing a dementia course for the Devon Recovery Learning Community, concluding that \u201crecovery orientated practice and co-production can and does work in the context of dementia.\u201d\nA barrier to routinely embedding co-production, and peer support, within mental health dementia services, is overcoming stigma. Here the stigmatising assumption is that people with progressive cognitive impairment cannot manage this level of participation, nor provide a \u201cvalid\u201d perspective. Participation activities such as re-designing services, recruiting staff or educating peers and clinicians (19) largely exclude people living with dementia. Yet evidence indicates that people with mild to moderate dementia continue to have significant self-awareness and agency in maintaining social connections (20).\nInclusively involving people with dementia in co-producing improvement planning has long been advocated as a personoriented, empowering approach to health service delivery (1, 21). This innovative method is achievable if given time and care and can lead to improved dementia care practice (22, 23). It offers a way to build trust and understanding between service users and providers through enabling transparency and shared ownership of projects and services (24). People with dementia who have been involved in co-production report personal benefits such as increased self-confidence and self-esteem derived from having something to contribute (2). Similar benefits are evidenced throughout the field of patient and public involvement in dementia research (25, 26), where people with dementia are actively involved at all levels of participation, including as coresearchers (27\u201330).\nThis paper presents a descriptive single case study (31) using qualitative interview data from four individuals, all participants in a service evaluation: a person with dementia and their family supporter and two specialist dementia care staff, and reports on interviewees\u2019 experiences of both codesigning and co-delivering newly-formed Recovery College dementia courses. \u201cCo-producing\u201d entails both co-designing and co-delivering courses."

They presented the course to the Recovery College\u2019s quality panel then went on to co-deliver courses. After the preliminary courses, the group shared reflections and made amendments before the next course. A complete course comprised 3 days over 3 consecutive weeks, and each day refreshed information from the preceding day to aid peoples\u2019 orientation and group cohesion. Course content included hearing directly from peer tutor\u2019s lived experiences and discussing topics such as: recovery using the CHIME framework (11), impact of dementia on relationships, stress management, and diagnostic disclosure. These aimed to facilitate group discussions. Following the onset of the COVID19 pandemic, co-production meetings to amend and pilot course delivery took place through an online format using the Zoom videoconferencing platform (32). The courses mainly aimed to help attendees share experiences and learn about living well with dementia, including through peer support, also aiming to improve quality in their memory service."

They described developing relationships during planning meetings and course days as being truly collaborative. Experiencing co-production as positive related to each person\u2019s motivations, sharing a sense of feeling good and being uplifted in the shift from clinical, to co-production relationships. The staff felt motivated by seeing co-production as central to their clinical roles, giving them time to re-centre themselves and their clinical teams on people and the lived experience of dementia. Staff described this way of working using words such as exciting, interesting, valuing and rewarding.\nStaff participant (SP)1: It\u2019s sometimes been the bit of the job that\u2019s kept me going. . . this is really powerful. . . it\u2019s really positive, it\u2019s a positive experience. SP2: It\u2019s been really nice to work alongside in that more partnership way, with someone with dementia and a carer.

And to be reminded of that.\nFrontiers in Rehabilitation Sciences | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 3 | Article 920496\nThe person with dementia talked about valuing this shift in relationships as they appreciated being involved, and the help this offered them personally. Talking about the meetings attended, to co-produce learning materials and delivering the course to peers, they used words such as good, comfortable and a privilege.\nInterviewer (I): What was your experience of being asked to be involved in the first place? Person with dementia (P): I was so pleased. It really made me feel as if I was going to be able to take advantage of whatever was in front of me and I really do appreciate it. (I): In what way? (P): Because of what I saw with my [parent]. It was just behind everything. We didn\u2019t know to help [them] and I am getting all the help that is out there, and I feel so privileged.\nThe family supporter, described being \u201cpleased\u201d and \u201cproud\u201d to be asked, and experiencing themselves as equal partners in decision-making as validating. Feeling actively listened to and involved was important in this process:\n. . . I was pleased that they asked me. . .

The process of co-producing learning material then merged with co-delivering the course to their peers, and for each interviewee, being involved in both activities helped them individually. The staff and family supporter clearly expressed how powerful the experience was. While the person with dementia similarly conveyed this, they did so in less explicit terms. For example, the person with dementia mentioned being amazed by dementia being so openly talked about and contrasted this openness with their earlier experiences of social stigma with their parent. All interviewees specifically described their work together as creating a powerful learning environment, describing being enabled and being open to learning new things, having their ideas challenged by learning from one another. The person with dementia described feeling \u201cgood,\u201d \u201ccomfortable,\u201d and so \u201cbetter\u201d through sharing their lived experience \u201cwith people that know all about it.\u201d However, they did not explicitly see themselves as a peer supporter, rather as someone being helped by openly talking about dementia. The family supporter could see this experience both helped their relative and benefitted themselves:\nFamily supporter: I can\u2019t do it with [person with dementia - P] onmy own. I couldn\u2019t have sat down with [P] and told [them] all that. [They] needed to be able to listen to other people saying the same thing, and I think it helped [them] with the professionals being there. As soon as [they] started talking to those that\u2019s when it made a difference.\nThe staff drew similar conclusions as to the power of the process of co-production in the context of the learning environment created by and based on interviewees lived and learned experiences. For the co-production element, the power came from the interviewees involved. This was summed up by the family supporter who explained a sense of being able to give something back. Nonetheless, staff interviewees identified that it was tricky to balance the group\u2019s diverse needs and opinions. In particular, how to facilitate contributions and establish and maintain the presence and voice of the person with dementia throughout the process of co-producing the courses over time. These challenges were overcome through the staff being mindful and sharing the process, in co-producing small pieces of work, going away and in pairs, critiquing the work to bring back points for discussion and reflection. Solutions\nFrontiers in Rehabilitation Sciences | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2022 | Volume 3 | Article 920496\nincluded setting the right pace, giving lots of time, space and support for the person with dementia to talk about their own, sometimes difficult, experiences of being diagnosed with, and living with dementia. All interviewees described co-production as a shared process of learning, reflecting, communicating, and challenging, rather than a one-off activity of question-asking. It required everyone to be open and inclusive and learn from each another and continuously reflect on their own thoughts and attitudes in a way that other forms of service user involvement might not."

That person talked about gaining personally through being with other people with dementia, within the context of the Recovery College course. Despite negative experiences of social stigma and fear of people behaving differently in response to their dementiaI don\u2019t want people watching me-being involved as an equal partner gave personal reassurance-it\u2019s easier telling people, it\u2019s just normal-and related a discovery that it would be okay to be open about personal lived experience of dementia and share this with other people.\nInterviewer (I): So you sharing your personal experience of living with dementia- having a diagnosis of dementia with other people who are on the course in the room, what\u2019s that been like, could you explain a bit? Person with dementia (P): Until you have been with someone who was in the same position, like as if it wasn\u2019t, something that was hidden, something that was not talked about. It was coming out into the open and people like my [parent] were getting help rather than, \u2018oh dear\u2019. Because there was nothing. [My parent] wasn\u2019t on any medication, mind you, I am talking about years ago, . . . when [they] died, but yeah. [They were] my age actually. Yes and it sometimes comes back, you know, and I am thinking what a position I am in now, and the position [they were] in. So that\u2019s why I appreciate everything that I am being able to get hold of. I: so there is something there that you are saying about being in a place where there\u2019s other people who are going through the same? P: Exactly. Exactly. The first [course], because there was someone there with dementia was amazing because it just wasn\u2019t talked about, now everybody is together and talking about it.\nThis dialogue demonstrates how this course co-production process could provide a safe and accessible space for this person with dementia to raise the negative impact of experiencing social stigma with peers and care staff. For the staff, other motivating factors and service improvement ideas, were identified from their reflections from working with people during and post-diagnosis. Drawing on their clinical experience and \u2018stepping into the shoes\u2019 of the person going through the process of diagnosis, the staff spoke of memory service limitations such as its being exclusively professional-led. This co-production work enabled them to offer something else important, as well as a diagnosis:\nStaff participant 1: . . . there\u2019s only so much work you can do with somebody, with just you and them in a room, that needing something that will support them in being able to think about life with that diagnosis. And that, it just felt like has- that has to come from lived experience.\nSpeaking about attendees on the course, the family supporter found it helpful to meet and hear directly from other people with dementia, to challenge their preconceived ideas that dementia was a fixed set of pre-determined features:\nFamily supporter: . . . and the thing was, that they were both different, all three of them were different dementias which was helpful to start with, it made me realise right at the beginning of this, that dementia just wasn\u2019t affecting [their relative], it was affecting people in different ways. . .\nRealising this reassured the family supporter that not every person with dementia experiences every difficult symptom, encouraging them to use their learning experience to codesign the course to help others. The group were supported to reflect from their own perspectives on their own experiences of dementia-related helplessness. By coming together, they could face this helplessness and develop meaningful representations, often found helpful to acknowledge and share with others accessing their memory service."

The relevance of the CHIME framework (11) to living with dementia was much debated. The group members, through active listening and sharing of experiences and knowledge considered the challenges to the relevance of the recovery model and agreed how to present this to others. All interviewees described building shared appreciation for each other\u2019s lived and learned experience and presence through the co-production experience.\nThe findings resonate with the CHIME framework element \u201cconnecting with others\u201d (11). Staff working in mental health have skills in balancing complex issues and needs, such as relationship dynamics, motivations, quality of interactions, language, and accessibility. Yet interpersonal processes involved in co-production relationships differ from those within clinical relationships. They require more skills in facilitating and managing co-production partners changing needs over time\nFrontiers in Rehabilitation Sciences | www.frontiersin.org 5 June 2022 | Volume 3 | Article 920496\nas dementia progresses. Importantly, this case study found that, despite actively co-producing work with people accessing memory services, the highly experienced staff interviewees, highlighted they needed to be reminded that people are still people. Bringing the topic of dementia into the Recovery College provided peer-led focused, reflective time to do this.\nThere remain significant barriers to co-production in dementia services becoming the norm. These ranged from clinicians\u2019 attitudes in developing skills to embed co-production in clinical practice, to finding time, alongside memory service waiting list pressures, to prioritise co-production. The staff interviewees described the process overall as demanding a considerable time commitment, and shift in the organisational culture to support the extra time, skills and resources clinical staff required (39). However, the family supporter described how the process was transformational in unpicking attitudes, so that co-production can bring about sustainable service-level change (40).\nRecovery Colleges provide distinctive opportunities for people with lived experience of dementia to raise awareness of the impact of stigma and to share impactful lived experience with health professionals, to aid their professional reflective learning. The structure and processes involved supported genuine changes in power dynamics in participant relationships in practice, allowing staff to ask questions and seek advice from people with lived experience. This dynamic would not happen in routine clinical practice. This transformation highlights the potential for professional-service user relationships to be renegotiated, within Recovery Colleges and also the wider healthcare system. As Eley (5) (p 221) suggests, \u201cit is unfair and unrealistic to expect an individual to be the lone voice in a room of professionals, to tell their story coherently and to challenge the views of clinicians and other professionals with confidence.\u201d The numbers ratio of service users to staff appears essential to facilitate mutuality and connectedness in a co-production relationship. The inclusive design of Recovery Colleges addresses this."

Each interviewee conveyed from their own perspectives, feelings of helplessness in relation to acting with or on dementia, and also talked about how being involved in co-producing a course offered each person hope. For the person with dementia, hope came in demonstrably receiving help not historically offered to a relative with dementia. For the family supporter, hope came from meeting other people with lived experience and then being able to challenge their own preconceived ideas about dementia. The staff reported hope in potentially being able to address service gaps in user-led postdiagnostic support, expressing a strong message that the course helped people to process a diagnosis and this as being best (or only) done with guidance of people with lived experience. This indicates a need for a real, more hopeful message around dementia. This finding provides a challenge to known barriers\nto co-production with people living with dementia, namely staff \u201cgatekeeping,\u201d protecting people following a dementia diagnosis from perceived extra work or burden (41), and family supporters having the stronger voice (37)."

For example, the person with dementia presented themselves as \u201cjust another person in the room\u201d rather than \u201ca peer supporter\u201d. This experience of being accepted and of a safe environment allowed them to see and present dementia as part of their identity, but without it being their only identity and therefore to find meaning in life regardless of living with dementia. Having dementia was not seen here as a barrier to people meaningfully contributing to co-producing the course. This challenges the assumption that a person with progressive cognitive impairment would be inevitably \u201cunable\u201d to give a valid perspective. In the context of an equalising social-relational environment, the person with dementia was enabled to share knowledge through lived experience which was both empowering for the individual and valued by the other interviewees. Specifically, this included the person with dementia reflecting on how being involved in this work helped to safely bring dementia out in the open and to experience challenging long-entrenched stigma in a way that helped them personally to positively share their diagnosis with others. Overall, analytic themes were found to position co-production within this case as fundamentally a relational activity, which, in presenting and valuing lived experiences, can gently yet powerfully, challenge widely-held restrictive and negative assumptions about living with dementia."

The findings, however, are consistent with other reported experiences in the Recovery College dementia course field (17, 18). A further limitation was that only two staff out of a possible four were available to take part within the project timeframe, and that other people with dementia who were joining the group but not yet experiencing co-production could not be included. Finally, while criteria for Recovery Colleges are available (42), there is currently no universal model of co-production which may mean local interpretations of using and enacting co-production may vary across Recovery Colleges."

            "text": "Co-production with people with dementia, their family supporters and staff from mental health services remains a relatively novel activity. Few accounts in the literature illustrate co-production experiences of people with dementia, their family supporters, and staff working in mental health services. This case study details ways in which co-producing a dementia course can offer a positive experience for all involved. Using the CHIME framework (11) built staff confidence in facilitating this work, to apply and fulfil their practice values, showing how a recovery-focused approach can be relevant to people adjusting to a dementia diagnosis. The powerful, inclusive shared learning environment this group created enabled each interviewee to learn new things including from one another, by challenging each other\u2019s ideas. Valuing as knowledge, the experiences of a person living with dementia was seen to generate novel and distinctive learning materials, processes and outcomes. Confronting dementia challenges together in this way within a recovery principles context helped reflect on feelings of isolation linked to adjusting to a dementia diagnosis."
