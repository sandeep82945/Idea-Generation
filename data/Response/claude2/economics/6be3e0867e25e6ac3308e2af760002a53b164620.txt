 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop more realistic models of asset prices and returns to better capture real-world financial dynamics. The paper assumes constant asset prices, but allowing for stochastic or time-varying prices could improve the model. 

2. Incorporate additional financial instruments beyond equities, such as derivatives, bonds, loans, etc. This would allow modeling a wider range of interconnections and contagion effects between financial institutions.

3. Expand the model to a multi-layer network to capture different types of financial dependencies, such as ownership, lending, derivatives exposures. This could reveal new insights into contagion effects. 

4. Conduct empirical validation and calibration of the model using real financial network data. Fitting and testing the model on empirical data could help refine and improve its predictive abilities.

5. Apply control theory techniques to design interventions and regulations to mitigate cascading failures. Optimal control approaches could identify cost-effective ways to make the system more resilient.
