Cross-Network Mechanism Design: Investigate the feasibility and design of mechanism designs that operate across multiple social networks or platforms. This could involve exploring how mechanisms like CTC can be adapted or extended to work in a multi-platform environment where users have different types of social connections and preferences across platforms.

Dynamic Mechanisms for Evolving Networks: Develop mechanism designs that can adapt to the dynamic nature of social networks, where users' preferences, connections, and the network structure itself can change over time. This could include mechanisms that periodically update or mechanisms that are robust to certain types of changes in the network.

Privacy-Preserving Mechanism Designs: Explore designs that maintain individuals' privacy regarding their preferences and social connections while still allowing for efficient matching. This could involve cryptographic techniques or differential privacy to ensure that participants' sensitive information is protected.

Application-Specific Mechanism Designs: Tailor mechanism designs to specific applications on social networks, such as job matching, content recommendation, or social event planning. Each application has unique characteristics and requirements that could benefit from specialized mechanisms that consider the specific types of interactions and transactions involved.

Incentive Structures for Diverse Participation: Investigate mechanisms that not only focus on optimality and stability but also ensure diversity and inclusivity in participation. This research could explore how to design incentives that encourage participation from a wide range of network users, ensuring that the benefits of the mechanism are equitably distributed.
