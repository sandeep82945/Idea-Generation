Background Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals are regarded as the highly skilled labor force that fosters economic productivity, enterprise innovation, and international competitiveness of a country. This study aims to understand the genetic predisposition to STEM occupations and investigate its associations with regional economic performance. We conducted a genome-wide association study on the occupational choice of STEM jobs based on a sample of 178,976 participants from the UK Biobank database. Results We identified two genetic loci significantly associated with participants’ STEM job choices: rs10048736 on chromosome 2 and rs12903858 on chromosome 15. The SNP heritability of STEM occupations was estimated to be 4.2%. We also found phenotypic and genetic evidence of assortative mating in STEM occupations. At the local authority level, we found that the average polygenic score of STEM is significantly and robustly associated with several metrics of regional economic performance. Conclusions The current study expands our knowledge of the genetic basis of occupational choice and potential regional disparities in socioeconomic developments. conclusion and discussion Against the background of an increasing shortage of STEM-related professionals in several countries such as the USA and the UK, the role of STEM education and jobs in revitalizing economic growth and the labor market in these countries has been subject to heated debate [17, 23]. The present study helps to inform this debate by empirically linking individuals’ STEM-related job choices with their genetic markups and estimating the associations between STEM polygenic scores and the
indicators of individual socioeconomic attainment and regional economic prosperity. Probing into these previously unexplored topics based on a large-scale dataset provided in the UKB, our GWAS also contributes to the fields of education, labor, and regional economics. Our study first identified two independent genetic loci associated with participants’ choice of STEM jobs (the most significant SNP in each of the two loci being rs10048736 on chromosome 2 and rs12903858 on chromosome 15). Further estimations revealed strong positive associations between individuals’ STEM PGS and their socioeconomic attainment (measured by college attendance and household income). We also demonstrated
statistically significant associations between the average STEM PGS and several indicators of regional economic performance (including local VAT, business counts, and business employment). Pieced together, these findings suggest that driven by STEM-related genetic markups, individuals choosing a STEM-related career may perform better in the labor market (through completing more years of STEM education), which may in turn improve local economic performance. While most of our findings point in the same direction, important heterogeneity remains. First, there is a significant gender gap in the STEM PGS-socioeconomic attainment association. More specifically, the estimated associations between the STEM PGS and the probabilities of having a STEM job and a college/university degree are much larger in males than in females. This difference might reflect the influence of environmental factors (such as gender stereotyping) that suppress the effect of STEM PGS among females. Interestingly, the STEM PGShousehold income association is more pronounced in females, which might reflect factors in the marriage market that we were unable to account for in our analysis. Secondly, there are also differences in the STEM PGSsocioeconomic attainment association across ethnic subgroups. Take the Chinese subgroup, for example. While the STEM PGS-STEM job linkage among Chinese is highest among all five ethnic subgroups examined, the STEM PGS-college degree and STEM PGS-income linkages (—the latter is statistically significant) among Chinese are nearly the lowest among the five. These ethnic disparities might be due to cultural factors. For example, while the genetic makeup induces Chinese individuals to pursue STEM education, the possible lack of entrepreneurship in the Chinese culture may dampen the effect of STEM PGS on their income. A potentially segmented labor market in the UK could also be a factor, since the segmentation might be due to demographic, social, cultural and political reasons. These ethnic disparities suggest that while promoting STEM education may be able to revitalize economic progress and promote individual welfare in general, policies tailored to different subgroups’ cultural and ethnic backgrounds may be needed to fully realize the potential of STEM education and STEM jobs. The findings of this study have several potential applications. Firstly, this study provides valuable information for policymakers and educators who are interested in promoting STEM education and jobs as a means of revitalizing local economic growth and improving individual socioeconomic outcomes. Secondly, this study highlights the importance of considering individual genetic makeup in understanding and addressing socioeconomic disparities. Thirdly, this study contributes to
the growing body of the literature on the genetics of complex traits and behaviors. Our findings also have implications for social equality. Specifically, we found significant differences in the associations between the STEM polygenic score and socioeconomic outcomes across gender and ethnic subgroups. These findings suggest that policies tailored to different subgroups’ cultural and ethnic backgrounds may be needed to fully realize the potential of STEM education and STEM jobs and promote social equality. For example, interventions that target gender stereotyping in education and the workplace may help to reduce the gender gap in the associations between STEM polygenic scores and socioeconomic outcomes. Similarly, interventions that promote entrepreneurship and innovation in ethnic subgroups where these factors are lacking may help to enhance the effect of STEM polygenic scores on income and promote social equality. Before closing, a note on the limitations of this study is in order. Finally, as with other GWAS, a fundamental methodological challenge is that population stratification can occur even in homogeneous populations [20]. Despite these limitations, we believe that our analysis has provided novel and valuable information to advance knowledge about genetic predisposition engaging in STEM job choices. We also hope our study can attract more GWAS or related studies on the nexus of genetic disposition, educational attainment, and labor market performance.
